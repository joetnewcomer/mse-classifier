988948,Words in the Category of Sets,"I was wondering about free objects in different categories and the ""words"" in those categories. I think I have a generally good grasp on the idea, but I started to think about stranger free objects such as free objects in the category of Sets, Rings, Fields, and Modules, as well as hypothetical structures with ternary+ operations. I understand the universal property of free groups, and to some extent of arbitrary categories, but I cannot fully comprehend the analogue of ""words"" in other free objects. Free Sets would be strange, what would words of free sets look like if that even could make sense? I was thinking it might just be the set of all singleton sets of each element in your generating set, so that the only words are the actual elements of the set. Or it might be useful to define it as the empty set? I have no idea. Any insight is wholly welcome.","['set-theory', 'category-theory', 'free-groups', 'group-theory']"

989005,What is a moduli space for a differential geometer?,"A moduli space is a set that parametrizes objects with a fixed property and that is endowed with a particular structure. This should be an intuitive and general definition of what a moduli space is. Now, in the contest of algebraic geometry, we refer to a moduli space as a scheme that (co)represents a particular functor, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}:\,\{\mathfrak{schemes}\}^{\circ}\longrightarrow\{\mathfrak{sets}\}
\end{equation}
that is called the $moduli \,functor$. The question if it is (co)representable is called the $moduli \;problem$. My question is, how does a differential geometer image a moduli space? That is, I thought that he thinks it in the same above way (replacing the category of schemes with a more suitable category), but it turns out that it is not so. thank you! EDIT: I have seen some people still look at this post, so maybe it is worth to add something. First of all,  the geometry of a $C^{\infty}$-manifold is much less rigid than that one of an algebraic variety. This reflects, for example, on the fact that in general we can find a lot automorphisms of the objects we are interested in. In particular, most of the cases (and probably 'all' the cases) we have no hope to get a fine moduli space: this justify the fact that, in differential geometry, one usually talks about moduli space without specify if it is fine or not. Secondly, regarding my description of the moduli problem. I have recently looked at the theory of $C^{\infty}$-schemes (see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4951v2.pdf ). This is a generalization of the concept of a $C^{\infty}$-manifold in the same way as a scheme is a generalization of an algebraic variety. An interesting aspect of this theory is, for example, that a $C^{\infty}$-manifold is always an affine $C^{\infty}$-scheme. Replacing the category of $C^{\infty}$-schemes in the moduli functor defined above, we can think at a moduli space of $C^{\infty}$-objects in the classical algebraic way. Moreover, this leads in a natural way to a theory of derived differential geometry. Finally, I feel quite confident with this. Neverthless, this theory is modelled on the algebraic analogue and it is very recent. Even if my interests are principally on algebraic geometry, I had asked this question because I was wondering how mathematicians from different areas of mathematics approach to the problem of studying moduli spaces (the basic aim was to better understand the mathematical feeling behind these objects). And since moduli spaces in differential geometry were studied before (or at least without) the theory of $C^{\infty}$-schemes, my primary question is still not anwered.","['differential-geometry', 'moduli-space']"

989043,Rigorous proof that surjectivity implies injectivity for finite sets,"I'm trying to prove that, for a finite set $A$, if the map $f: A\rightarrow A$ is a surjection, then it's an injection.  I've looked at this post: Surjectivity implies injectivity but the arguments there seem very round-about, proving that injectivity implies surjectivity first.  I think I've seen other proofs, too, but they all sound kind of flimsy.  They tend to go something like ""If the function is surjective then no two arguments can go to the same image, since that would require some element of the range not being the image of any element.""  While that's true and I see what the argument has in mind, it's no more convincing than the statement of the claim that we're trying to prove!  Without a more rigorous proof, both seem to rely on the intuition that everything has to go to one and only one thing, but we're supposed to be proving that. But I've been trying to develop a more thorough and direct proof, and haven't been able to.  I've tried induction: The theorem holds trivially if $|A|=0$.  Suppose the theorem holds up to $n=|X|$, and let $|A|=n+1$ and $f:A\rightarrow A$ be a surjection.  Then let $x\in A$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ be the set of all elements $y\in A$ such that $f(y)=x$... But at this stage I want to restrict my function, but that has the disadvantage that if $f(y)$ has more than one element in it, when I pluck it out of $A$ as the domain and pluck $x$ out of $A$ as the range, then I may not be dealing with a function mapping from a set to itself and so I don't get to use the inductive hypothesis.

989050,A method of finding the eigenvector that I don't fully understand,"Let $$A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c  \\ d & e & f  \\ g & h & t \\ \end{pmatrix}$$
  Which has a known eigenvalue : $\lambda$ Find the corresponding eigenvector Over the last few months, I have come across  several ways to do this: (1) $$Ae=\lambda e$$ $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c  \\ d & e & f  \\ g & h & t \\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1  \\ x_2  \\ x_3 \\ \end{pmatrix}= \lambda \begin{pmatrix} x_1  \\ x_2  \\ x_3 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ Which is  the longer (more time consuming method. (2) Some  do it in this way: $$(A-\lambda I)e=0$$ $$\begin{pmatrix} a-\lambda & b & c  \\ d & e-\lambda & f  \\ g & h &  t-\lambda \\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1  \\ x_2  \\ x_3 \\ \end{pmatrix}=0$$ And mostly  they  perform reduce row echleon form to speed the process up. (3) Most recently I came across a method which is the fastest so far, but I don't understand how it works. And sometimes it doesn't work for me, I get correct R answer and sometimes wrong. Here is how it is, (similar to taking cross product of two vectors): It is EVALUATING $$\begin{bmatrix} i & j & k  \\ d & e-\lambda & f  \\ g & h & t-\lambda \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Or $$\begin{bmatrix} i & j & k  \\ a-\lambda & b & c  \\ d & e-\lambda & f \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Or $$\begin{bmatrix} i & j & k  \\ a-\lambda & b & c  \\ g & h & t-\lambda \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Etc any two rows How does this work? And why doesn't it work sometime? Why  doesn't it work with some matrices ? (Sometimes) Although this is much time saving, it is unreliable to me which I believe is because I don't understand well in order to apply it correctly Example : Let $$A=\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 & -1  \\ -4 & -1 & 4  \\ 0 & -1 & 5 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ $\lambda=3$ $$\begin{bmatrix} i & j & k  \\ 4-3 & 1 & -1  \\ 0 & -1 & 5-3 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Eigenvector: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1   \\  -2  \\  -1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ But yes the evaluation goes like this.","['linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

989182,Group objects in category of $\mathcal{Set}$ are groups - How to prove it?,"Reading about group objects in categories, it's a fact that a group object is in the category of $\mathcal{Set}$ just a common group. I am trying to give an actual proof of this, but I'm a bit confused on how to connect the group axioms to the definition of a group object - mainly because the group axioms work with elements inside of a group, but in category theory, the elements of an object don't really play a role. So I wonder how to actually proof that a group object in $\mathcal{Set}$ is indeed a group. The definition of a group object as I know is the following, given by Richard Pink in ""Finite group schemes"": A (commutative) group object in the category $\mathcal{C}$ is a pair consisting of an object $G \in ob(\mathcal{C})$ and a morphism $\mu : G \times G \to G$ such that for any object $Z \in ob(\mathcal{C})$ the map $G(Z) \times G(Z) \to G(Z)$, $(g, g') \mapsto \mu \circ (g, g')$ defines a (commutative) group. Where $G(Z)$ is the set of morphisms $Z \to G$.

989261,About integral binary quadratic forms fixed by $\operatorname{GL_2(\mathbb Z)}$ matrices of order $3$,"I am reading this paper of Manjul Bhargava and Ariel Shnidman, and I want to prove this claim, which appear at the first paragraph of Theorem $14$: Up to $\operatorname{SL_2}(\mathbb Z)$ equivalence and scaling, there is only one integral binary quadratic form having an $\operatorname{SL_2}(\mathbb Z)$-automorphism of order three, namely $Q(x,y)=x^2+xy+y^2$. Now the pertinent definitions in order to understand the problem. Consider the following action of $\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$ on the set of integral binary quadratic forms: for $\gamma\in$$\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$ and $f(x,y)=Px^2+Qxy+Ry^2$, with $P,Q,R\in\mathbb Z$, we define $(\gamma f)(x,y)=f\bigl((x,y)\gamma\bigr)$. Identifying each such $f$ with the triplet $(P,Q,R)^t$, we have that the triplet associated to $\gamma f$ is given by the matricial product $$M_{\gamma}\,\cdot\begin{bmatrix} P\\ Q\\ R\end{bmatrix},\ \text{where}\ \
\gamma=\begin{bmatrix}
A & B\\
C & D
\end{bmatrix}\,\ \text{and}\ M_{\gamma}=\begin{bmatrix}
A^2 & AB    & B^2\\
2AC & AD+BC & 2BD\\
C^2 & CD    & D^2
\end{bmatrix}.$$ With these notations the authors' claim can be restated as follows: Suppose that $f=(P,Q,R)^t$ is fixed by $\gamma\in\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$ of order $3$ and $Q\ne0$. Show that there exist $\theta\in\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$ and $n\in\mathbb Z$ such that $\theta f=(n,n,n)^t.$ I have had a very bad time trying to prove this fact. Perhaps my understanding of the problem is wrong, but I honestly don't think so (I successfully completed the previous details of the paper). My work so far: Let $a=A+D$ be the trace of $\gamma$. Since $\gamma^3=I$ then $\det\gamma=1$, so the characteristic polynomial of $\gamma$ is $X^2-aX+1$. Now $$X^3-1=(X+a)(X^2-aX+1)+(a+1)\bigl[(a-1)X-1\bigr]\,,$$ and since $\gamma$ also satisfies $\gamma^3-I=0$, then after evaluating the equality above at $\gamma$ we obtain that either $a=-1$ or $(a-1)\gamma=I$; but $(a-1)\gamma=I$ implies $(a-1)^3=1$, that is $a=2$, and so $I=(a-1)\gamma=\gamma$, contradicting the fact that $\gamma$ has order $3$ in $\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$. On the other hand $\gamma^{-1}$ also fixes $f$, so denoting $(P,Q,R)^t$ by $v$ we obtain $(M_{\gamma^{-1}}-M_\gamma)v=0$. Using the formula $\gamma^{-1}=\binom{\ \ D\ \ -B}{\!\!\!-C\ \ \ \ A}$ together with the equalities $AD-BC=1$ and $A+D=-1$ we get $$\begin{align*}
M_{\gamma^{-1}}-M_{\gamma}=&\,\begin{bmatrix}
D^2  & -BD   &  B^2\\
-2CD & AD+BC & -2AB\\
C^2  & -AC   &  A^2
\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}
A^2 & AB    & B^2\\
2AC & AD+BC & 2BD\\
C^2 & CD    & D^2

\\[5mm]
=&\,\begin{bmatrix}
A-D & B & 0 \\
2C  & 0 & 2B\\
 0  & C & D-A
\end{bmatrix}\,,
\end{align*}$$ and so $v$ has the specific form $v=\frac Q{A-D}(-B,A-D,C)^t$. Now I am stuck at this point: If $\theta=\binom{B\ \ \ 0}{D\ \ \ 1}$ then $M_\theta\cdot(n,n,n)^t=v$, where $n=\frac{-Q}{B(A-D)}$ (it is easy to see from the equalities $AD-BC=1$ and $A+D=-1$ that $B(A-D)\ne0$). The problem is, of course, that $n$ is not necessarily an integer and that $\theta$ not necessarily belong to $\operatorname{GL_2}(\mathbb Z)$. Changing $B$ by $1$ in $\theta$ does not work, because scaling the first row of $\theta$ amounts to a corresponding quadratic scaling at the first row of $M_\theta$, but keeping the same scaling at the second row of $M_\theta$, so the desired equality is not preserved.

989349,Proving the reverse triangle inequality of the complex numbers,"I'm having trouble understanding this proof for the reverse triangle inequality of the complex numbers. Suppose for any $z, w \in \mathbb{C}$, we have $|z + w| \leq |z| + |w|$ (the triangle inequality). Prove $|\,|z| - |w|\,| \leq |z - w|$. To prove this, we know $|z + w| \leq |z| + |w|$.  Then letting $v = z + w$ gives $z = v - w$, and so we get the inequality $|v| \leq |v - w| + |w|$, or equivalently, $|v| - |w| \leq |v - w|$. Great, so now we have $|v| - |w| \leq |v - w|$.  For some reason, this implies that $|w| - |v| \leq |w - v|$, and then this clearly implies $|\,|w| - |v|\,| \leq |w - v|$. Two questions: We proved that given arbitrary $z, w$ in $\mathbb{C}$, if $v = z + w$, then $|v| - |w| \leq |v - w|$.  Why does this imply we can say $|w| - |v| \leq |w - v|$? We only proved the inequality for $v$ of the form $z + w$.  How does this magically extend to holding for all complex numbers?

989827,"Etymology of ""flabby"" or ""flasque"" sheaf","I just started working with flasque, or flabby sheaves, that is sheaves whose restriction maps are surjective for any two open set of the space. I wonder about the etymology of the term. In French, flasque can mean both ""flabby, without consistence"" and ""bottle"". It seems that the English term comes from the first of those meanings, but in French and Italian (where the two meanings are distinguished by pronunciation) the ""bottle"" meaning is used. This is justified by the fact that a flasque sheaf has its section ""falling down"" from the global sections as if they were poured from a bottle. So I wonder: is the English translation a misinterpretation? If not, is there a motivation for it?","['algebraic-geometry', 'math-history', 'terminology']"

$$ x = r \cos \theta, \qquad y=r \sin \theta$$

Two approaches which I think don't work: Implicit differentiation: this doesn't help since the implicit function theorem is only local. So it cannot help us prove that atan2 is a single $C^1$ function over the entire domain described above. Replace $\mbox{atan2}(x,y)$ by $\tan^{-1}(y/x)$: this throws away information about the signs of $y$ and $x$ and hence cannot represent $\mbox{atan2}$ over the entire domain. Also, $y/x$ is undefined when $x=0$, but there are such points in the domain.

989882,Expressing the integral $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sqrt{\left(1-x^3\right)\left(1-a^6x^3\right)}}$ in terms of elliptic integrals,"Define the function $\mathcal{I}:\left(0,1\right)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ via the definite integral $$\mathcal{I}{\left(p\right)}:=\int_{0}^{1}\mathrm{d}x\,\frac{4p}{\sqrt{\left(1-x^{3}\right)\left(1-p^{6}x^{3}\right)}}.\tag{1}$$ Question : Given $p\in\left(0,1\right)$ , is there a (relatively) simple way to express $\mathcal{I}{\left(p\right)}$ in terms of elliptic integrals in Legendre normal form? Can $\mathcal{I}{\left(p\right)}$ possibly be written as a simple scalar multiple of a complete elliptic integral of the first kind? Recall that for amplitude $\theta\in\left(0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ and elliptic modulus $\kappa\in\left(0,1\right)$ , the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind $F{\left(\theta,\kappa\right)}$ is defined as $$F{\left(\theta,\kappa\right)}:=\int_{0}^{\theta}\mathrm{d}\varphi\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa^{2}\sin^{2}{\left(\varphi\right)}}}.\tag{2}$$ Motivation: I have noticed that of the questions on this site related to proving special closed form values of the Gauss hypergeometric function, ${_2F_1}{\left(a,b;c;z\right)}$ , an unusually large number of the more difficult ones can be shown equivalent to proving the particular hypergeometric function with parameters $a=\frac12$ , $b=\frac13$ , and $c=\frac56$ , i.e., ${_2F_1}{\left(\frac12,\frac13;\frac56;z\right)}$ , takes some special (usually algebraic) value for some particular (usually rational) value of $z$ , where $0<z<1$ . So in the interest of generalization, I wanted to see how close one could get to obtaining a closed form for $f(z):={_2F_1}{\left(\frac12,\frac13;\frac56;z\right)}$ for arbitrary values of $z\in(0,1)$ . Using Euler's integral representation for the Gauss hypergeometric function with the assumption that $0<z<1$ , we have: $$\begin{align}
f(z)
&={_2F_1}{\left(\frac12,\frac13;\frac56;z\right)}\\
&=\frac{1}{\operatorname{B}{\left(\frac13,\frac12\right)}}\int_{0}^{1}t^{-\frac23}(1-t)^{-\frac12}(1-zt)^{-\frac12}\mathrm{d}t\\
&=\frac{3}{\operatorname{B}{\left(\frac13,\frac12\right)}}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sqrt{(1-x^3)(1-zx^3)}},\tag{3}\\
\end{align}$$ where the beta function factor can alternatively be written in terms of the gamma function as, $$\operatorname{B}{\left(\frac13,\frac12\right)}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2^{4/3}\pi}\left[\Gamma{\left(\frac13\right)}\right]^3.$$ The integral factor in the last line of $(3)$ is already superficially quite similar to the following integral representation of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind: $$K(k)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-k^2t^2)}}.$$ Moreover, the last line of $(3)$ implies that in order for $f(z)$ to take an algebraic value, the integral factor will be the product of an algebraic number $A$ with an elliptic integral singular value : $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sqrt{(1-x^3)(1-zx^3)}}=A\,K{\left(k_3\right)}=A\frac{3^{1/4}}{2^{7/3}\pi}\left[\Gamma{\left(\frac13\right)}\right]^3.$$ This made me suspect that the integral $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\sqrt{(1-x^3)(1-zx^3)}}=\mathcal{I}{(z^{1/6})}$ might be capable of being written as a linear combination of complete elliptic integrals in general.","['closed-form', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'elliptic-integrals', 'hypergeometric-function']"

Actually these conditions are equivalent, I proved opposite implication but got stuck with this one. My try was to assume that $\exists f_i,g_i$ such that $\sup \sum_i f_i\circ g_i - f_i < 0$ what would imply that $-\sum_i( f_i \circ g_i - f_i) > 0$ and after mapping this sum by $\phi$ one can obtain (using linearity and given condition on $\phi$) that $\phi \left(-\sum_i( f_i \circ g_i - f_i) \right)=0$ but this is not contradiction yet.

990260,Axiomatic Bargaining: Nash's Solution,"The following text is from the book: Bargaining and Markets by Osborne and Rubinstein , Academic Press Inc . Page 17 under the chapter The Axiomatic Approach: Nash's Solutions: . Two individuals can divide a dollar in any way they wish. If they fail
  to agree on a division, the dollar is forfeited. The individuals may,
  if they wish, discard some of the dollar.   In terms of our model, we
  have   $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i
> \ge 0$ for $i = 1, 2\}$  (all possible divisions of the dollar), and 
  $D = (0, 0)$ (neither player receives any payoff in the event of
  disagreement).   Each player is concerned only about the share of the
  dollar he receives: Player $i$ prefers $a \in A$ to $b \in A$ if and
  only if $a_i \gt b_i (i = 1, 2)$. Thus, Player $i’s$ preferences over lotteries on $A$ can be represented by the expected value of a utility function $u_i$ with
  domain $[0, 1]$ . My question: In the last line what good does it serve by using ""expected value"" in  the line: expected value of the utility function $u_i$ with domain $[0,1]$ Instead, what will we lose if we just write: ""...represented by the utility function $u_i$ with domain $[0, 1]$.""$?$ (i.e we drop expected value) EDIT 1: (added after reading @Shane 's answer) In the above question Set $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i  \ge 0$
  for $i = 1, 2\}$,    $D=(0,0) \in A$, $D$ is the disagreement event .
  For each Player $i$ there is a function $u_i:A \cup \{D\} \to \mathbb R$
  , called a utility function, such that one lottery is preferred to
  another if and only if the expected utility of the first exceeds that
  of the second . Here I am not able to visualize a lottery $L$ as is mentioned in the answer by @Shane. What will this lottery look like? When calculating the expected value, which all elements of $A$ will we take into consideration (since $A$ is a non denumerable infinite set)? PS: It is taken from the famous, Nash's Axiomatic Bargaining Theory . EDIT 2: @Shane I know about vNM utility theorem. The problem is, I am not able to apply it here. Here $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i  \ge 0 \}$. So $A$ has infinite elements. A typical $A$ would look like $\{(0.1,0.9),(0.2,0.4),(0.5,0.1),(0,0)...\}$. It will have infinite elements. In this particular example let us call $p=(0.1,0.9),q=(0.2,0.4),r=(0.5,0.1),s=(0,0)$. So for Agent $1$, $r\succ q \succ p \succ s $ since $r_1\gt q_1 \gt p_1 \gt s_1$. (If choosing among the above four alternatives only). Here, Nash says that each player's preference be defined on a set of lotteries over possible agreements and not just on the set of agreements themselves. Further: one lottery is preferred to another if and only if the expected
  utility of the first exceeds that of the second . Let us say that $u_i(a)=a_i$ where $a \in A$ and $i=1,2$ So if I try to construct a lottery , say $L=t_1 \cdot p+t_2\cdot q+t_3\cdot r+t_4\cdot s$ where $\Sigma t_i = 1$ and $M=x_1\cdot p+x_2\cdot q+x_3\cdot r+x_4\cdot s$ where $\Sigma x_i = 1$ and $p,q,r,s \in A$. By vNM, for agent 1, $L \succ M$ iff $t_1u_1(p)+t_2u_1(q)+t_3u_1(r)+t_4u_1(s) \gt x_1u_1(p)+x_2u_1(q)+x_3u_1(r)+x_4u_1(s)$ OR, $t_1p_1+t_2q_1+t_3r_1+t_4s_1 \gt x_1p_1+x_2q_1+x_3r_1+x_4s_1$ Right? My doubts: here I just picked up $4$ elements of $A$. But there are infinite such elements in $A$. So how will I come up with a lottery? I mean we will not get such $t_i $ or $x_i $ such that $\Sigma t_i = 1$ or $\Sigma x_i = 1$. EDIT 3 Our agreement set is as usual $A=\{a_1, a_2, a_3 \cdot \cdot \cdot\}$ where $a_k$s are various agreements over which the two agents can reach. If the two agents do not reach to an agreement then disagreement event $D=(d_1,d_2)$ is invoked. Let a general element of the set $A$ be denoted by $a$. For example in the case of our “splitting the dollar game” the agreement set, $A = \{(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb R^2: a_1 + a_2 \le 1$ and $a_i \ge 0$ for $i = 1, 2\}$. Here $D=(0,0)$ Now the text (in the above mentioned book) says: Denote by $p \cdot  a$ the lottery in which the agreement $a \in A$ is
  reached with probability $ p \in [0, 1]$  and the disagreement event $D= (d_1,d_2)$
   occurs with probability $1 – p$. Let $\succcurlyeq _i$ be Player $i’$s preference ordering over lotteries of the form $p \cdot a$, and
  let $\succ _i$ denote strict preference. Consider an agreement $a^*$
  with the property that for $(i, j) = (1, 2)$ and $(i, j) = (2, 1)$, for
  every $a \in A$ and $p \in [0, 1]$ for which $p \cdot a \succ_i a^*$
  we have $p \cdot a^* \succcurlyeq_j a$. My doubt is how can we construct a lottery like $p \cdot a$ where sum of probabilities is not equal to 1.

990394,Square root and principal square root confusion,"A few months ago I asked a question about the $\pm$ symbol because I was confused about it... I still carry the same confusion (which really bugs me) but I think the real confusion has to do with the square root and principal square root. I hope I can finally grasp the concept with the following two questions... Question 1: $\sqrt{12x^2} = \sqrt{4\cdot3x^2} = 2|x|\sqrt{3}$ Why do we only have to keep in mind that $x$ could be negative, yet we just factorize $\sqrt{12}$ to $\sqrt{3\cdot4}$ and put the 2 right in front of the radical sign? $\sqrt{12}$ could be factorized as $\sqrt{-3 \cdot -4}$ as well. Question 2: I've been told to take the square root of both sides in the following equation, but the square root doesn't have its own symbol right? Only the principal root does... So if you'd use the radical sign you're using the principal root and therefore you're missing out on a solution in the following scenario: $(x + 8)² = 1 \iff \sqrt{(x + 8)^2} = \sqrt1 \iff x + 8 = 1 \iff x = -7$ Does that mean that whenever we want to take the square root of something (not the principal) we just use a $\pm$ symbol instead? For example: $(x + 8)^2 = 1 \iff x + 8 = \pm 1 \iff x = -8\pm1$","['notation', 'arithmetic', 'algebra-precalculus']"
