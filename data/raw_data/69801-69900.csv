849070,Is there a shorter/faster way to show these two expressions are equal?,"I want to know if the two expressions are equivalent: $\frac{1}{2}(k+2)(2a+(k+1)b)$ $\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(2a+kb)+(a+(k+1)b)$ My attempt: First, I decided to start with 2 as 1 looks complicated to me (expanding it is time consuming). Since 1 has $\frac{1}{2}$ as a factor, I try to express 2 in terms of $\frac{1}{2}$ to get: $\frac{1}{2}\left[(k+1)(2a+kb)+2a+2(k+1)b \right]$ Since there is a $(k+2)$ in 1, I decided to expand everything in the square bracket and hope that $(k+2)$ is a factor of that expression: $\frac{1}{2} \left[ k^2b+3b+2ak+4a+2b\right]$ Using polynomial long division to divide the expression in the square brackets by $(k+2)$, I get: $\frac{1}{2} \left[(k+2) (kb+b+2a) \right]$ Which can be simplified to: $\frac{1}{2}(k+2)(2a+b(k+1))$, as required. Is there a more efficient method to solve this kind of question and how will you reason about it?

Can the non-elementary functions be decomposed to elementary ones?

849121,Who first proved the fundamental theorem of finitely generated (or finite) abelian groups?,"The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups (or maybe just finite abelian groups) is well-known and can be found in just about any text on the theory of groups or abstract algebra.  Any finitely generated abelian group $A$ has a primary decomposition:
$$A \simeq \mathbb{Z}^{n}\oplus\bigoplus_{k=1}^{m}\mathbb{Z}_{q_{k}} ,$$
in which the $q_{k}$ are prime powers.
It also has an invariant factor decomposition:
$$A\simeq \mathbb{Z}^n\oplus\bigoplus_{k=1}^{s}\mathbb{Z}_{f_{k}},$$
in which $f_{1}\mid f_{2}\mid\cdots\mid f_{s}$. My question is: Who first proved these results? I looked at several standard texts, and a bunch of online results, but I found only a confused indication of who first established these.  Both Robinson and Rotman indicate that the primary decomposition is due to Frobenius-Stickelberger, but might (in part?) date back to Gauss, while some online sources (e.g., MathWorld ,
usually fairly reliable) call it a Kronecker decomposition, suggesting perhaps a different history. I did not see any indication of who proved the invariant factor decomposition, or which (if not worked out simultaneously) came first.","['reference-request', 'math-history', 'group-theory']"
849136,"""Closed"" form for $\sum \frac{1}{n^n}$","Earlier today, I was talking with my friend about some ""cool"" infinite series and the value they converge to like the Basel problem, Madhava-Leibniz formula for $\pi/4, \log 2$ and similar alternating series etc. One series that popped into our discussion was $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^n}$. Proving the convergence of this series is trivial but finding the value to which converges has defied me so far. Mathematica says this series converges to $\approx 1.29129$. I tried Googling about this series and found very little information about this series (which is actually surprising since the series looks cool enough to arise in some context). We were joking that it should have something to do with $\pi,e,\phi,\gamma$ or at the least it must be a transcendental number :-). My questions are: What does this series converge to? Does this series arise in any context and are there interesting trivia to be known about this series? I am actually slightly puzzled that I have not been able to find much about this series on the Internet. (At least my Google search did not yield any interesting results).",['sequences-and-series']
849163,Apostol (6.22.10): Finding $\int \frac{\arcsin x}{x^2} dx$,"I'm trying to solve another integral from Apostol (Chapter 6, Section 6.22, Question 10) which says to show the following:
$$
\int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx = \log|{\frac {1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}}| - \frac {\arcsin x}{x} +C
$$
I have tried the following:
With $\int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx$ I started using integration by parts, choosing $u = \arcsin x $ and $dv = 1/x$ which lead to
$$
\int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx = -\frac{\arcsin x}{x} + \int \frac{dx}{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
$$
= -\frac{\arcsin x}{x} + \int \frac{x.dx}{x^2.sqrt{1-x^2}}
$$
With the Integral on the RHS, I set $u^2 = 1 - x^2$ which implied $x^2 = 1- u^2$ and $xdx = -u. du$. This meant
$$
\int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \int \frac{-u du}{u (1-u^2)} = \int \frac{-du}{ 1-u^2} = -\int \frac{du}{1-u^2}
$$
For the integral $\int \frac{du}{1-u^2}$, I set $u = \sin \theta$ which meant $du = \cos\theta. d\theta$ which implied 
$$
\int \frac{du}{1-u^2} = \int \frac{\cos\theta}{1 -\sin^2\theta}d\theta = \int\sec\theta\,d\theta = \log|\sec \theta + \tan \theta| = \log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}|
$$
Now, since $u = \sin \theta$ in the last substitution and $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ it follows that $\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-u^2}$ which means
$$
\log|\frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}| = \log |\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}|
$$
$$
= \log|\frac{1+u}{\sqrt{1-u}\sqrt{1+u}}|
$$
$$
= \log|\frac{\sqrt{1+u}}{\sqrt{1-u}}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}|
$$
That is
$$
\int \frac{du}{1-u^2} =\frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}|
$$
Now, in the first substitution $u^2 = 1 - x^2$ implies $u = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ which means
$$
\frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+u}{1-u}| = \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{1+ \sqrt{1-x^2}}{1 - \sqrt{1-x^2}}|
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}{(1 - \sqrt{1-x^2})(1+\sqrt{1-x^2})}|
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2}\log|\frac{2 - x^2 +2\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x^2}|
$$
$$
= \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}|
$$
That is
$$
\int \frac{xdx}{x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}} = - \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}|
$$
with respect to the original integral means
$$
\int \frac {\arcsin x}{x^2}dx = -\frac{\arcsin x}{x} -  \log|\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}| + C
$$
which is not the answer as stated in Apostol's book. I've probably made some error in the calculations which I just haven't been able to find, so if someone can point out the error in my calculations that would be appreciated","['calculus', 'integration']"

849186,What do I not understand about one-to-one functions?,"Firstly, a definition: Definition 1: A function $\phi : X \rightarrow Y$ is one-to-one if $\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)$ only when $x_1 = x_2$. Now the question: Students often misunderstand the concept of a one-to-one function (mapping). You see, a mapping has a direction associated with it, from $A$ to $B$. It seems reasonable to expect a one-to-one mapping that carries one point $A$ into one point of $B$, in the direction indicated by the arrow. But of course, every mapping of $A$ into $B$ does this, and Definition 1 did not say that at all. With this unfortunate situation in mind, make as good a pedagogical case as you can for calling the functions in Definition 1 two-to-two functions instead. Definition and question ever so slightly modified from A First Course in Abstract Algebra by Fraleigh. So this is my thoughts: First of all, despite the fact that Definition 1 did not say this, I thought it could be more or less inferred. As in, there is a formal, and intuitive definition of a derivative, but they more or less mean the same thing. But, I guess if this were considered a two-to-two the best argument I could think of is given $x_1 = x_2 \in A$, and $\phi(x_1):=y_1 = \phi(x_2):=y_2 \in B$, then the ""diagram"", so to speak looks more or less like: $$ x_1 \rightarrow y_1 \leftrightarrow y_2 \leftarrow x_2 $$ So there is a kind of a two-to-two symmetry, but to me, it is a very weak (couldn't we just cut out the middle anyway?) argument, and don't believe this is what the question is getting at. Can someone explain to me what most students don't understand?","['terminology', 'functions']"
849192,Statistical search for two needles in random haystacks,"I have written a script to analyze some data at work, and for each run, it outputs a long list of integers. Each set of results is a frequency distribution (each integer appears one to many times). The result set also includes two particular integers that I have to automatically identify (called a co-pair). [P.S. The ""co-pair"" is just a term my supervisor uses, it is not a standard mathematical term. ] I tested the script with smaller data sets where I already know what the co-pair should be, and realized that neither of the integers in the co-pair are always the most frequent or the least frequent in the set. Now I am at a loss what other way to statistically examine the result set and automatically find the co-pair for ANY set of data. I have a relatively weak background in statistics so I am hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Edit: More context. Essentially after analyzing my data I have many sets of frequency distributions and I want to compare all of the sets at once to find answers ""defining the co-pair"", such as: (a) ""the co-pair are ALWAYS at ogive 35 and ogive 80"" or (b) ""the co-pair are ALWAYS the mode and the least frequent number in each set"" etc. The solution is definitely not either of the above, but what statistical methods can I use to compare many data sets to explore the relevance of particular needles in each haystack, to get an answer that works for identifying the co-pair within ALL the sets, an answer like either (a) or (b)? Edit two:
I have thousands of data sets where I already know what the co-pairs are. I want to statistically analyze them and research what possibly defines them within each set, so I can apply the same methods to the other millions of data sets where I DO NOT know the co-pairs.",['statistics']

849284,"Looking for different proofs of ""Discrete Liouville's Theorem"".","Good day. There is a question I have already encountered twice, in very different contexts, that is relatively simple looking, but both solutions I know involve some pretty advanced theorems from the respective fields. I would like to ask if someone could think of any different proofs. So, here is the question: 
 Let $f: \mathbb Z^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ satisfy $f(m,n) = \frac14(f(m+1,n) + f(m-1,n) + f(m,n+1) + f(m,n-1))$. i.e. $f$ is defined on a grid, at a value at a point is the average of its four neighbors. Assume that $f$ is bounded (in some versions, bounded from below only). Prove that $f$ is constant. One proof of the question uses martingales, and relies, I think on the martingale convergence theorem. In the proof, you define a two-dimensional random walk $S_n$ and look at the process $f(S_n)$. The other proof comes from functional analysis, and uses the Krein-Milman theorem on the set $K_1 = \{f \in L_{\infty}(\mathbb Z^2) | f(m,n) = \frac14(...), ||f||\leq1 \} $, after finding its extremal set (which is the constant functions $\{+1,-1\}$). So, any other proofs of this seemingly simple question? I should suspect there is something related to complex analysis, since for analytic functions this would follow from the Liouville theorem. Also, perhaps a combinatorial solution?","['functions', 'probability-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'combinatorics']"

Well, while I find the proposition about the flux very intuitive (and dimesionally sound), I'm very confused about the interpretation of circulation.

The problem is to show that $f'(a):\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is not injective.

But suppose that a monic cubic is irreducible, and all its coefficients are positive, but there does not exist such a prime. Sometimes we can find an integer $k$ such that we can substitute $x=y+k$ into the cubic, and the resulting polynomial in $y$ will satisfy the criterion.

My question is whether or not this stronger version of the criterion applies to every irreducible polynomial. That is to say, if $x^3+ax^2+bx+c$ is irreducible, then we can always find some integer $k$ such that $(y+k)^3+a(y+k)^2+b(y+k)+c$, when simplified, will satisfy the criterion.

\begin{align}
  X_b(x) = 2(b\cdot x)x - x^2 b,
\end{align}
where $x^2 = x\cdot x$.  This is the conformal killing field that generates special conformal transformations. How does one solve for the integral curves of this monster? Apparently, the (local) answer (which I've only ever seen magically pulled out of a hat) is as follows:
\begin{align}
  x(t) = \frac{x_0 - x_0^2(tb)}{1-2x_0\cdot(tb) + x_0^2(tb)^2} \tag{$\star$}
\end{align}
How can one at least somewhat systematically arrive at this?  The system of ODEs one needs to solve is non-linear and coupled; I'm rather at a loss as to how to even begin attacking it. Note: eq. $(\star)$ written down and discussed briefly in A Mathematical Introduction to Conformal Field theory by Schottenloher, 2nd ed., p. 17. It is also all over the place in the theoretical physics literature where one sees statements to the effect of ""integrating the infinitesimal version of the special conformal transformation gives..."" and then $(\star)$ is written down. Progress! I think I've almost figured it out using a tricky change of variables.  We want to solve
\begin{align}
  \dot x = 2(b\cdot x)x - x^2 b.
\end{align}
Make a change of variables
\begin{align}
  y = \frac{x}{x^2}
\end{align}
and after some algebra, one shows that $y$ satisfies
\begin{align}
  \dot y = -b
\end{align}
which has as a solution
\begin{align}
  y = y_0 - tb,
\end{align}
so now we simply need to solve the algebraic equation
\begin{align}
  \frac{x}{x^2} = \frac{x_0}{x_0^2} - tb.
\end{align}
The solution quoted above certainly solves this, but how does one solve this equation ""from scratch?"" Solution As pointed out by, @ HunsLundmark , the algebraic equation
\begin{align}
  \frac{x}{x^2} = A
\end{align}
can be readily solved to give $x = A/A^2$, so setting $A = x_0/x_0^2-tb$ gives the desired result.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

u&=-\ln{(1-x)},\\
-u&=\ln{(1-x)},\\
e^{-u}&=1-x,\\
x&=1-e^{-u},\\
\mathrm{d}x&=e^{-u}\,\mathrm{d}u.

&=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{u^3}{1-e^{u}}\ln{(1-e^{-u})}\,\mathrm{d}u.
\end{align}$$ This looks like it has a shot at being evaluated in terms of series expansions, but I'm stuck at this point. Suggestions welcome. Update: Using the series expansions $\ln{(1-e^{-x})}=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}e^{-nx}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}e^{-kx}=\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}$, the integral becomes: $$\begin{align}

Next, consider the set  $\mathcal{H}$ of all sub-sets of $\mathcal{A}$ 
that have area $m_{\mathcal{A}}/2$. Now, given $H\in\mathcal{H}$, define the set $\mathcal{B}_H$ as the set of all lines having non empty intersection with $H$.

850244,"Asymptotically, how many random students do I have to mark before I've marked two consecutive students","Background The motivtion for this question comes from observations made by a colleague while he was marking homework and recording the marks this year. His procedure for recording the marks is as follows.  The homework is placed into his folder by students before the deadline, (presumably) in a 'random' order.  Once the deadline passes, he collects the folder, and starts marking.  He takes the first script from the folder, marks it and records the mark on the mark-sheet.  Then he takes the next script, marks it and records it.  And so on... Whilst doing this, he noticed that one would surprisingly quickly have entered marks for two consecutive students on the list.  For example, in a class of 20 students, it only took 4 or 5 scripts on average. This prompted some questions from him on the distribution of this number: What is the expectation and standard deviation? Is there an explicit formula for any class size? (Or a recurrence relation, or any other good way to compute it?) How does it behave asymptotically for large classes? Setup of Problem Let's phrase the problem a bit more precisely, so I can explain what we've succeeded in doing. Suppose you have a line of $ N $ boxes, all initially unfilled.  Select uniformly at random an unfilled box, and fill it in.  Repeat this until two consecutive boxes have been filled in, then stop.  (The boxes form a line, and do not wrap around, so the two end boxes are not considered consecutive.)  The value of the discrete random variable $ X_N $ is then the number of filled in boxes. In particular we are now looking for Explicit formulae for $ E(X_N) $ and $ \operatorname{Var}(X_N) $, (or recurrence relations, or whatever), and the asymptotic behaviour of these Example: When $ N = 3 $, there possible ways to terminate with two consecutive boxes are End, then middle with probability $ \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3} $ and $ X_3 = 2 $ Middle, then end with probability $ \frac{1}{3} 1 = \frac{1}{3} $ and $ X_3 = 2 $, or End, other end and finally middle with probability $ \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{2} 1 = \frac{1}{3} $ and $ X_3 = 3 $. So, we've got the full distribution of $ X_3 $, and we can compute that $ E(X_3) = 2 \frac{2}{3} + 3 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3} = 2.\overline{3} $, et cetera. Current Work I have managed to give an explicit (though unpleasant) formula for $ E(X_N) $.  Roughly this is by analysing how the process can terminate with $ n+1 $ boxes filled, looking at the configuration one step before the end, and breaking this up into various types.  (No ends filled, one end filled, both ends filled and various numbers, $ k $, of 'triples' like $ \blacksquare \square \blacksquare $.)  I can then count the number of each type of configuration using standard combinatorial techniques, and then work out the probability of ending with $ n+1 $ boxes filled.  I get: \begin{align}
E(X_N) &= \sum_{n=1}^{\left\lfloor \frac{N+1}{2} \right\rfloor} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n+1) \binom{n-1}{k} \Bigg[ (2n-k) \binom{N-2n}{n-k} + 2(2n-k-1) \binom{N-2n}{n-k-1} \\ & {} \quad + (2n-k-2) \binom{N-2n}{n-k-2} \Bigg] \left( n! \frac{(N-n)!}{N!} \frac{1}{N-n} \right) \, ,
\end{align} and similarly I can get the variance.  (You can still see something of my approach reflected in the structure of the formula.) Using this, we can compute
$$
E(X_{20}) = 153641/33592 \approx 4.5737377947 \, ,
$$ with standard deviation $ \approx 1.6291544998 $, corroborating his initial observations. From here, we can compute the first thousand or so values of $ E(X_N) $, to get a feeling for the behaivour at large $ N $.  The result is as follows: So, at the first glance, is looks like maybe $ E(X_N) \sim N^{1/2} $ (plus or minus a small power).  But it's at this point I'm stuck. Questions My specific questions about this problem are: Is there a neater/more compact/more elegant formula to explicitly compute $ E(X_N) $? Can it be done via a recurrence relation? What sort of techniques are well suited to this type of computation? How accurate is my guess that $ E(X_N) \sim \sqrt{N} $? Can I determine the asymptotic behaviour from the explicit formula? If not, how can I go about finding the asymptotic behaviour? Lastly, (though I'm not expecting anywhere near a complete answer) how does all of this generalise to more complicated arrangements of boxes? Say we do this on an $ N\times M $ grid, and we stop when we fill in two adjacent boxes (including diagonally, or not including diagonally). Or more generally, randomly filling in the vertices of a graph, with the edges determining adjacency. What if some boxes have multiple parts, so can be filled in a number of times?","['asymptotics', 'probability']"

(a) Prove that $G$ permutes the sets $\mathcal{O}_1,\mathcal{O}_2,\dots,\mathcal{O}_r$ in the sense that for each $g \in G$ and each $i \in \{1,\dots,r\}$ there is a $j$ such that $g \mathcal{O}_i=\mathcal{O}_j$, where $g \mathcal{O}=\{g \cdot a \, | \, a \in \mathcal{O}\}$ (i.e., in the notation of Exercise 7 the sets $\mathcal{O}_1,\dots,\mathcal{O}_r$ are blocks). Prove that $G$ is transitive on $\{\mathcal{O}_1,\dots,\mathcal{O}_r\}$. Deduce that all orbits of $H$ on $A$ have the same cardinality. (b) Prove that if $a \in \mathcal{O}_1$ then $|\mathcal{O}_1|=|H: H \cap G_a|$ and prove that $r=|G:HG_a|$. [Draw the sublattice describing the Second Isomorphism Theorem for the subgroups $H$ and $G_a$ of $G$. Note that $H \cap G_a=H_a$.] Here is my attempt: (a) Fix some $g \in G$ and  $i \in \{1,2,\dots,r\}$. Let $\{a_k\}$ be representatives of the orbits $\{\mathcal{O}_k\}$ (so that $\forall k$ $\mathcal{O}_k=H \cdot a_k$) ,and let us denote $g \cdot a_i$ by $a_j$. We have by normality $g \mathcal{O}_i=g H a_i=H g a_i=H a_j=\mathcal{O}_j$. Since $G$ acts transitively on $A$, given any $a_i,a_j \in A$ we may find an element $g \in G$ with $g \cdot a_i=a_j$, so that $g \mathcal{O}_i=\mathcal{O}_j$. Since the map $\sigma_g:A \to A$ defined by $\sigma_g(a)=g \cdot a$ is a bijection, restricting it to $\mathcal{O}_i \subseteq A$ gives a bijection $\mathcal{O}_i \to \mathcal{O}_j$, where $\mathcal{O}_j$ is the image $g \mathcal{O_i}$. By transitivity it follows that all orbits have the same cardinality. (b) Since $G$ acts transitively on the set of orbits $\{\mathcal{O}_k\}_{k=1}^r$ we have $r=|G:G_{\mathcal{O}_1}|$. Observe that (where in the following $h$ stands for some element of $H$)
$g \mathcal{O}_1=\mathcal{O}_1 \Leftrightarrow g \cdot a=h \cdot a \Leftrightarrow h^{-1} g \cdot a=a \Leftrightarrow h^{-1}g \in G_a \Leftrightarrow g \in HG_a$.
Thus the proof is complete. My questions regarding this are: Is this proof correct? How is it possible to prove (b) using the Second Isomorphism Theorem as described in the hint? I tried to do it but it only worked out if $G$ is finite, in which case I could rewrite indices as quotients of orders. Thank you!","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

    1 & \quad \text{if the ith ball is blue, and i-1, i+1 balls are both red}\\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}

$$ Therefore we get E[X]:
$$
E[X_i] = \frac{15}{25} * \frac{10}{24} * \frac{14}{23} = \frac{7}{46}\\
\\
E[X]  =  \sum_{i=1}^{25} E[X_i] = 25*\frac{7}{46} = 3.804\\
$$ Now for the variance:
$$
Var(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{25} Var(X_i) + 2*\sum_{i<}\sum_{j} Cov(X_i,X_j) \\
Var(X_i) = p*(1-p) = \frac{7}{46}*\frac{39}{46} = \frac{273}{2116} \\

    |i-j|=1 & \quad \text{0 (since 2 blues are adjacent)}\\
    |i-j|=2 & \quad \frac{7}{46}*\frac{9}{22}*\frac{13}{21} = \frac{39}{1012}\\
    |i-j|>2 & \quad \frac{7}{46}*\frac{13}{22}*\frac{9}{21}*\frac{12}{20} = \frac{117}{5060}
  \end{array} \right.\\
\text{and since } \quad Cov(X_i,X_j) = E[X_i X_j] - E[X_i]E[X_j] \\
\\
$$
we get:
$$
Cov(X_i,X_j) = \left\{  \begin{array}{1 l}
    |i-j|=1 & \quad 0 - (\frac{7}{46})^2 = -\frac{49}{2116}\\
    |i-j|=2 & \quad \frac{39}{1012}-(\frac{7}{46})^2 = \frac{179}{11638}\\
    |i-j|>2 & \quad \frac{117}{5060}-(\frac{7}{46})^2 = -\frac{1}{29095}\\
  \end{array} \right.\\
$$ Now, we need the sum of the Covariances. To do this we need to know how many of each case there are- and this is where I'm getting confused. 
I would think we would do as follows:
We have 25c2 different possibilities where i!=j (where they can be placed).
We have 25 where |i-j| = 1, 25 where |i-j|=2 (it's a circle), and 250 where |i-j|>2. Naively, I get: 
$$
Var(X) = 25*\frac{273}{2116} + 2*(25*(-\frac{49}{2116})+25*\frac{179}{11638}+250*(-\frac{1}{29095})) = 2.8194\\
$$ But it's a circle, so technically we have 25 ways of looking at the circle, meaning I should divide by 25 - 
but, these are not taking into account all the permutations of the 25c10 different possibilities, so I would be discounting possibilities by doing so.. I feel like this is wrong because I'm not taking into account the circle (except by allowing 25 indicators instead of 24 or 23, which is only adding possibilities and not removing them).

850369,Is the intersection of the conjugates of a subnormal subgroup of prime power index also a subgroup of prime power index?,"I was wondering if it's really the case that, if $G$ is a group with subgroups $H$ and $N$ such that $H\unlhd N\unlhd G$ such that $G/N$ and $N/H$ is a $p$-group, then the intersection of all the conjugates of $H$ in $G$ is also of $p$th power index. This problem actually comes from a Galois Theory problem, which asks to prove that if $F\hookrightarrow K\hookrightarrow L$ are field extensions such that $K$ is Galois over $F$, and $L$ is Galois over $K$, both with $p$ groups as Galois groups, then the Galois closure of $L$ over $F$ also has a $p$ group as a Galois group. The Galois theory solution is to note that $L$'s Galois closure is the composite field of the conjugates of $L$ in an algebraic closure of $F$, and use the fact that the degree of a composite extension divides the product of the degrees of each composite factor. But I was wondering if there were a purely group-theoretic proof of (what I think is) the corresponding statement stated in terms of the Galois groups.","['galois-theory', 'group-theory']"

850439,Distance of a vector from a subspace - Linear Algebra,"I want to calculate the distance of the vector $x=(1,1,1,1)$ to the subspace $\{(1,0,2,0) , (0,1,0,2)\}$ I have solved this in 2 ways that I know of but the thing is, the results are different. For instance when I use $||x-Pr(x)||$ I get $\sqrt{2}$, but when I calculate it using the gram determinant (more info here: Distance between a point and a m-dimensional space in n-dimensional space ($m<n$) )  I get $\sqrt{\frac{10}{25}}$ which is weird because both ways should be equivalent. So my question is, what am I missing here? Which one of these result was the correct one? Thank you. Edit: Solution using $||x-Pr(x)||$ : Let $v_1$ be $(1,0,2,0)$ and $v_2$ be $(0,1,0,2)$ Both vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthogonal meaning the inner product of them is $0$. Now we need to make them orthonormal. After doing so we get $e_1=v_1/\sqrt{3}$ and $e_2=v_2/\sqrt{3}$ Now we calculate $\Pr(x)$. $$\Pr(x)= (x,e_1)e_1+(x,e_2)e_2 =\ldots= (1,1,2,2)$$ Therefore the distance is $d(x,U)= ||x-\Pr(x)||=||(1,1,1,1)-(1,1,2,2)||= ||(0,0,-1,-1)||= \sqrt{2}$",['linear-algebra']

850475,A bijection defined on the set of configuration of lamps,"Consider $n$ lamps clockwise numbered from $1$ to $n$ on a circle. Let $\xi$ to be a configuration where $0 \le \ell \le n$ random lamps are turned on. A cool procedure consists in perform, simultaneously, the following operations: for each one of the $\ell$ lamps which are turned on, we verify the number of the lamp; if $i$ is turned on, a signal of range $i$ is sent by this lamp, and it will be received only by the next $i$ lamps which follow $i$, turned on or turned off, also considered clockwise. At the end of the operations we verify, for each lamp, turned on or turned off, how many signals it has received. If it was reached by an even number of signals, it remains on the same state(that is, if it was turned on, it will be turned on; if it was turned off, it will be turned off). Otherwise, it's state will be changed. The example for $n=4$, illustrates a configuration where lamps $2$ and $4$  are initially turned on. Lamp $2$ sends signal only for the lamps $3$ e $4$, while lamp $4$ sends signal for lamps $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$. Therefore, we verify that lamps $1$ and $2$ received only one signal, while lamps $3$ e $4$ received two signals. Therefore, in the next configuration, lamps $1$ and $4$ will be turned on, while lamps $2$ e $3$ will be turned off. Let $\Psi$ to be the set of all $2^n$ possible configurations, where $0 \le \ell \le n$ random lamps are turned on. We define a function $f: \Psi \rightarrow \Psi$ where, if $\xi$ is a configuration of lamps, then $f(\xi)$ is the configurations obtained after we perform the cool procedure described above. Determine all values of $n$ for which $f$ is bijective. This is a problem from Brazillian Olympiad. I tried considering a polynomial $\displaystyle F(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ix^i$ where $a_i=1$ if $\displaystyle i^{\text{th}}$ lamp is on, and $0$ otherwise. But I don't see how to incorporate the fact here. If someone could help it would be better. Thanks.","['generating-functions', 'contest-math', 'combinatorics']"
