136363,Is $T^1 S^5$ abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$?,"One can ask When is $T^1 S^n$, the unit tangent bundle of $S^n$, abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times S^n$? For even $n$, the answer is never.  This is because $T^1 S^{2n}$ has torsion in its cohomology ring, but $S^{2n-1}\times S^{2n}$ doesn't, so $T^1 S^{2n}$ is not even homotopy equivalent to $S^{2n-1}\times S^{2n}$. For odd $n$, the answer is more delicate. Since $S^1$, $S^3$, and $S^7$ are parallelizable, $T^1 S^1$, the unit tangent bundle to $S^1$, is diffeomoprhic to $S^0\times S^1$.  Likewise, $T^1 S^3$ is diffeomorphic to $S^2\times S^3$.  The same argument shows $T^1 S^7$ is diffeomorphic to $ S^6\times S^7$.  In all of these cases, a much stronger statement is true:  $T^1 S^{k}\cong S^{k-1}\times S^k$ as bundles over $S^k$ (for $k=1,3,7$.) So, the first case where I don't know the answer is $T^1 S^5$.  The first thing to say is that $S^5$ is not parallelizable, so $T^1 S^5$ is not bundle isomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$.  I can prove that $T^1 S^5$ and $S^4\times S^5$ have the same cohomology rings and that their respective tangent bundles have the same Stiefel-Whitney, Pontrjagin, and Euler classes.  So none of the ""usual"" invariants distinguish them.  (More generally, I think I can prove that $T^1 S^{2n-1}$ and $S^{2n-2}\times S^{2n-1}$ have isomorphic cohomology rings and the same characteristic classes). On the other hand, a paper by De Sapio and Walschap, ""Diffeomorphism of total space and equivalence of bundles"" proves that $TS^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n\times S^n$ are not abstractly diffeomorphic, unless they are also bundle isomorphic.  So, we know that $TS^5$ is not diffeomoprhic to $\mathbb{R}^5\times S^5$.  So, if $T^1 S^5$ and $S^4\times S^5$ are diffeomorphic, then no diffeomorphism can extend to a diffeomorphism of $TS^5$ and $\mathbb{R}^5\times S^5$. I'm not sure how hard the answer for $S^5$ will compared to any other $S^{k}$ with $k$ odd $\neq 1,3,7$, so I'll ask the $S^5$ question separately: Is $T^1 S^5$ abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$?","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
136367,A different approach to the strong Goldbach conjecture?,"Consider the set A of prime numbers $p_i$ such that $p_i+6$ is not prime (listed in OEIS 140555; see comments thereto).  Let 'Goldbach representation' mean a pair of odd prime numbers which sum to a given even number. Theorem Conjecture: For any even number $E>6$ which has a Goldbach representation consisting of two members of set A, there is at least one other Goldbach representation of $E$ which contains at least one prime number which is not a member of set A. My questions are: can anyone prove this theorem conjecture? Or suggest how to attack it? Has this approach to Goldbach been pursued before? Comments: If Goldbach is false, then there is an integer $K$ such that $2K$ is the smallest number that has no Goldbach representation.  The following argument is true for all appropriate values of $a$ (and the theorem conjecture could be restated for other values of $a$, using sets defined as $p_i$ such that $p_i+2a$ is not a prime), but I will discuss the specific instance of $a=3$. Since $N=2(K-3) < 2K, N$ has a Goldbach representation.  However, if either of the primes in any Goldbach representation of $N$ can be supplemented by 6 to yield another prime, then $2K$ itself will have a Goldbach representation, which is counter to our assumption.  So if Goldbach is false, all Goldbach representations of $2(K-3)$ must contain only members of A.  Hence, proving the theorem conjecture stated is equivalent to proving Goldbach.  Note that even if the theorem conjecture as stated (i.e. for $a=3$) is not true, the restatements of the theorem conjecture for every appropriate value of $a$ must also fail in order for the Goldbach conjecture to be false.  Thus the Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to saying that there is some value for $a$ for which a theorem conjecture of the form given is true.","['goldbachs-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

136379,Probability of land ownership,"During a research related to economy of land ownership, I ran into an interesting probability problem: There are N citizens and N land-plots. A. Initially, each land-plot is given to a citizen selected at random. B. Then, each land is sold with probability $q$. In case it is sold, the buyer is selected at random. C. Then, each citizen that had land before B, and has no land now, is given back ONE OF the land-plots he had before step B, selected at random. This returning is repeated until all citizens that had land before B have some land now. This process (steps B-C) is repeated. The question is: how will the expected number of citizens with no land (""landless"") change as a function of time? I ran some simulations , and found out that it decreases like $\frac{1}{  A t + B}$, where t is time, and A, B are linear regression coefficients. However, I would like to find a closed formula. Currently, the only thing I managed to find is the expected number of landless at time $0$, since the probability to be landless is the probability to get no land at the initial division: $(1 - \frac{1}{N}) ^ N$.

136404,Extending Galois automorphism to group automorphism,"Let $F \subset K$ be a field extension of degree $n$, then $F^n \cong K$ as $F$-vectorspaces. Now $K^\times$ acts on $F^n$, by multiplication on $K$, and so $K^\times$ embeds into $GL_n(F)$, and every Galois element gives an automorphism of $K^\times$. Question: Under which conditions can it be extended to an automorphism of $GL_n(F)$? How? Cyclic extension, abelian extension, solvalabe extension, general extension? I am mostly interested in the case, where $F$ is a local field. Example $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$: We fix an $\mathbb{R}$-basis $\\{ 1,i \\}$. The multipliaction by $a+ib$ correspond to the matrix 
$$ \begin{pmatrix} a & -b \newline b & a \end{pmatrix}.$$
The Galois element is complex conjugation and corresponds to transpose on the above matrices. Can it be extended to the group $GL_2(\mathbb{C})$?

136408,"Given two randomly chosen natural numbers, what is the probability that the second is greater than the first?","Suppose that there exists some apparatus that, when prompted, displays a random natural number (i.e. it picks an integer uniformly from the range $[1, \infty)$). A man writes down a number generated by this apparatus, denotes it as the first number, and afterwards prompts the apparatus for another number, writes it down, and denotes it as the second number. What is the probability that the second number will be greater than the first number? I think the answer is $\frac{1}{2}$, because in the general case, the probability of the second number being greater than the first given two integers selected from the range $[1, n]$ is $\frac{n - 1}{2n}$. If you take the limit of this as $n$ approaches infinity, you get $\frac{1}{2}$. I have a friend who says that the answer is $1$, since the first number is guaranteed to be finite. He argues that if you have some finite number and then choose a random number from the set $[1, n]$, the resulting number, with probability $1$, will be greater than the originally chosen finite number. Which one of us, if not both, is wrong? Or is the problem poorly defined and thus impossible to answer?",['probability']
136410,Domination of complex-value polynomial by highest power.,"The problem: Let $P(n)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ . Let $$M(r):= \underset{|z|\le r}{\mbox{sup}} \hspace{2mm} \left|P(z)\right|.$$ I desire to establish that $$r\mapsto \frac{M(r)}{r^n}$$ for $r>0$ is non-increasing as a function of $r$ . At least I believe this to be true and necessary to conclude a long homework assignment :P. 1st attempt at solution I think it is reasonable to assume the polynomial has no constant term, for adding a constant term as far as I understand can only change the $M(r)$ term by a constant. So $P(z)$ can be taken to fix the origin.
Then considering, say the holomorphic function, $$\frac{P(rz)}{M(r)}$$ the function should take the disk to the disk, so we can apply Schwartz's Lemma, and get the inequality: $$\left|\frac{P(rz)}{M(r)}\right|\le |z|$$ From here I would hope to pick a nice $z$ in the disk to establish something useful... I'm at a loss. 2nd attempt at solution I did start thinking, establishing an inequality between expressions doesn't quite get me that an expression is non-increasing. What would get me there is taking derivative. I think it's clear $M(r)$ is smooth. So we can differentiate the function in question (with respect to $r$ ) and get that the derivative is: $$\frac{M'(r)r^n - n r^{n-1}M(r)}{r^{2n}}=\frac{M'(r)r - n M(r)}{r^{n+1}}$$ We want that this derivative is $\le 0$ . That is, that $$M'(r) \le \frac{n M(r)}{r}$$ The RHS sort of makes me think of what $M'(r)$ would look like. $P'(z)$ would of course be almost $\frac{n P(z)}{z}$ , except of course for the constant term of $P(z)$ which disappears when differentiating.",['complex-analysis']

136570,Determination of complex logarithm,"Good day everyone. I was reading more advanced lecture notes on complex analysis and encountered a lot of questions, concerning the determination of complex logarithm. So far I don't even understand the concept of it, but I'll provide you with several practical questions concerning the topic. First of all, the determination of the complex logarithm on an open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ is continuous $f(w)$ such that: $$\forall w \in \Omega \text{ }\exp(f(w))=w$$ So then it starts. Maybe someone could explain what presumptions the following statement contradicts. There is no continuous determination for complex logarithm in $\mathbb{C}$ \ ${0}$ . The second part is more practical. We say that determination of the complex logarithm is called principal if it given as a complement of $\mathbb{C}$ and semi axis of negative or zero real numbers $\Omega_{\pi}=\mathbb{C}$ \ $\{z\in \mathbb{C} : \Re(z) \leq 0\}$ . Such as $$ f(z) = \log(|z|)+ i\begin{cases} \arcsin{(y/|z|)} & x \geq 0, \\ \pi - \arcsin{(y/|z|)} & x \leq 0,\, y \geq 0, \\ -\pi - \arcsin{(y/|z|)}  & x \leq 0,\, y \leq 0. \end{cases}$$ We can see that the argument belongs to $(-\pi,\pi]$ , but I neither understand why a set without negative real numbers defines such an argument nor how it happens. After this there is an example stating that if we take $\Omega_0=\mathbb{C}$ \ $\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \Re \geq 0\}$ then the argument will be $(0,2\pi]$ but I also didn't get how this happens. What will happen if we remove the non positive imaginary part? What kind of argument will we have then?

136627,Terms that get closer and closer together [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Why doesn't $d(x_n,x_{n+1})\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ imply ${x_n}$ is Cauchy? I was thinking about sequences where it appears the terms get closer and closer together, and wondered if they converge. Now let's first define a few things. When I say ""the terms get closer and closer together"", I mean ""the distance between any two consecutive terms approaches zero."" In other words, for a sequence $\left(x_n\right)$, $$|x_n-x_{n-1}| \to 0$$ consecutive terms become closer and closer together. Let's look at an example: $\left(\ln n\right)$. Clearly, $$\bigl|\ln (n) - \ln (n-1)\bigr|\to 0$$ and this can be verified by looking at a graph. At first, I saw this and thought $\left(x_n\right)$ and $\left(\ln n\right)$ looked like Cauchy sequences, and this was bugging me for the longest time, because I knew $\left(\ln n\right)$ was not supposed to be Cauchy! But I realize now that there is a subtle difference: for a Cauchy sequence $\left(y_n\right)$, $$|y_n-y_{m}| \to 0$$ So in the cases of $\left(x_n\right)$ and $\left(\ln n\right)$, it may be true that consecutive terms are closer together, but two arbitrary terms aren't necessarily close together. So $\left(\ln n\right)$ is definitely not Cauchy. What can we call sequences such as $\left(x_n\right)$ and $\left(\ln n\right)$, where consecutive terms become closer together? I'd like to propose a name: let's call them Cauchy-ish . An intuitive geometric view of a Cauchy-ish sequence $\left(x_n\right)$ might be that you have a bunch of points on a line, and as you move forward in the sequence, the points get closer and closer together. It seems to me that this sequence would converge, no? Obviously my intuitive side and my analytical side disagree, because $\left(\ln n\right)$ is Cauchy-ish but is not Cauchy.

Now I can map every $q$ to a number $k$, where $k$ is equal to the product of all elements of $q$.  ($k = p_1p_2p_3\ldots$) (for an empty set $q$, $k$ may be equal to one) Let the set $K$ consist of all possible values of $k$.
Now because of the uniqueness of the prime factorization I can also map every number $k$ in $K$ to a $q$ in $Q$. (letting $k=1$ map to $q=\{\}$) Thus there exists a bijection between $Q$ and $K$. But $K$ is a subset of the natural numbers which are countable, and $Q$, being the power set of $P$, needs to be uncountably infinite (by Cantor's theorem), since $P$ is countably infinite.

Under what conditions is an inverse necessarily two-sided? And what are the simplest proofs for these? Theorems I have so far: A magma may have multiple distinct left-identities or multiple distinct right-identities, but can never have a distinct left and right identity. [1: $\forall x. lx=x$. 2: $\forall x. xr=x$. 1 implies that $lr=r$ while 2 implies that $lr=l$. So either $l=r$ or at least one of 1 or 2 is false.] Associativity plus the existence of a two-sided inverse is enough to imply that any inverse is two-sided. [If $y$ is the left-inverse of $x$ then $xyx = x(yx)=xi=x$. By associativity, $xyx=(xy)x=x$, which implies that $xy=i$. In other words, $y$ is also the right-inverse of $x$.] I have a feeling that an associative magma cannot have one-sided identities - but I cannot prove this.","['semigroups', 'group-theory']"

136821,Can the n-string sphere braid group embed in to the (n+1)-string sphere braid group?,"This question has been cross posted on MathOverflow with some very interesting answers and discussion. I'm currently writing a project on the braid groups and their analogues on closed surfaces. It's an easy exercise to show that if $B_n$ is Artin's classical braid group on $n$ strings, then $B_n$ can be embedded in $B_{n+1}$ (the homomorphism is given by 'adding a string' on to the end of any braid in $B_n$ and this can be shown to be a monomorphism). A similar statement can be proved for the pure braid group $P_n$. Let $P\mathcal{S}_n$ be the pure $n$-string braid group on the sphere $S^2$. Fox's definition of this group is the fundamental group of the configuration space $F_{n}S^2=\prod_n S^2\setminus\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)|\exists i\neq j, x_i=x_j\}$ with basepoint $\hat{x}=(\hat{x}_1,\ldots,\hat{x}_n)$. The full braid group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is then the fundamental group of the configuration space $B_nS^2=F_nS^2/\sim$ where $x \sim y$ if the coordinates of $y$ are a permutation of the coordinates of $x$. It follows that $\mathcal{S}_n/P\mathcal{S}_n=\Sigma_n$ where $\Sigma_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ elements. It's well known that for $n\geq 3$, $P\mathcal{S}_n$ (and so $\mathcal{S}_n$) has torsion elements (given by the solution to the Dirac string problem for instance). With that framework now built up, my question is, can $\mathcal{S}_n$ be embedded in to $\mathcal{S}_{n+1}$ for $n\geq 3$ (and similarly for their pure counter parts)? The naive 'add a string on the end' map will not work because, for instance, the following trivial braid $\gamma$ here (see image below) becomes non-trivial when a string is added on the end, and so any such map would not respect the equivalence class of isotopic braids. I would think that the answer is no, but a proof eludes me. I've not been able to find any answer in the extensive literature which leads me to believe that the question is difficult.

Obviously it is is a partial sum of the series for $e^k$ -- but this partial sum doesn't reach close to $e^k$ itself because we're cutting off the series right at the largest terms. In the full series, the $(k+i-1)$th term is always at least as large as the $(k-i)$th term for $1\le i\le k$, so $f(k)< e^k/2$. Can we estimate more precisely how much smaller than $e^k$ the function is?

136999,Continuity proof.,"I want to prove that $\exp x$ and $\sin x$ are continuous. This means I want to show that $$\lim\limits_{x\to a}e^x=e^a$$ $$\lim\limits_{x\to a}\sin x=\sin a$$ for any fixed $a \in \Bbb R$. Then I need to show that for any $\epsilon >0$ there exists a $\delta >0$ such that whenever $|x-a|<\delta$, then $|\sin x -\sin a|<\epsilon$ and similarily $|e^x-e^a|<\epsilon$. For the first case I have that $$\left| {\sin x - \sin a} \right| = 2\left| {\sin \frac{{x - a}}{2}} \right|\left| {\cos \frac{{x + a}}{2}} \right|$$ for the second case I use $$\left| {{e^x} - {e^a}} \right| = \left| {{e^a}} \right|\left| {{e^{x - a}} - 1} \right|$$ ADD Just for the sake of a simple solution: Let $\epsilon>0$ and $a\in \bf R$ be given. Choose $\delta = \epsilon$. Then we have that $$\eqalign{
  \left| {\sin x - \sin a} \right| = 2\left| {\sin \left( {\frac{{x - a}}{2}} \right)\cos \left( {\frac{{x + a}}{2}} \right)} \right| &\cr 
   = 2\sin \left| {\frac{{x - a}}{2}} \right|\cos \left| {\frac{{x + a}}{2}} \right| &\cr 
   \leqslant 2\left| {\frac{{x - a}}{2}} \right| = \left| {x - a} \right| < \delta  = \epsilon  &\cr} $$ For the exponential, we have that $\log:(0,+\infty)\to \Bbb R$ is continuous, one-one, onto, and differentiable on $(0,+\infty)$. It follows that $\exp:\mathbb R\to (0,\infty)$ defined by $\exp x =y \iff \log y = x$ is also continuous and differentiable. Definitions : $y=e^x$ is the inverse of $y=\log x $ defined as $$\log x = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{x^k-1}{k}$$ Here I gave a list of the elementary functions of $\log$. I would probably choose to define $\sin$ like this Checking Apostol's Calculus I found he proves the continuity of $\sin x$ by first proving that if $f$ is (Riemann) integrable in $[a,x]$ for all $x\in [a,b]$ then $$F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$$ is continuous for all $x\in [a,b]$. Under this light it is evident $$\sin x = \int_0^x \cos t dt $$
$$\cos x = 1-\int_0^x \sin t dt $$
$$e^x = \int_0^x e^t dt+1$$ are all continuous.","['calculus', 'continuity', 'limits']"

The goal is: show that this is a lie algebra homomorphism $\mathfrak{sl}(3,\Bbb C)\to \mathfrak{gl}(6,\Bbb C)$ . Our basis in our space of polynomials is the standard one.  Namely, the degree 2 terms in their various permutations. I've been looking into the complexification of $\mathfrak{su}(3,\Bbb C)$ as a way of making sense of the polynomial when acted on by h, but I can't seem to get a handle on how to understand the derivative.

137165,Stokes theorem for Lorentz manifolds,"Reading Tao's book: Nonlinear Dispersive Equations I came upon an identity (the energy flux identity for the wave equation, page 90) for which the proof uses the Stokes theorem. In this case he uses the Stokes theorem on a truncated backward lightcone: $\{(t,x):0\leq t \leq t_1, |x| \leq T_* -t\}$ The problem here is that, when integrating along the boundary of the cone; the curved part (i.e., the mantle): $\{(t,x) : 0 < t < t_1, |x| = T_* -t\}$ is a null hypersurface with respect to the usual Minkowski metric, which he uses. When you restrict the Minkowski metric to a null hypersurface you get a degenerate metric. He explains that we can fix this apparent burden in a footnote: Strictly speaking, $\Sigma_1$ [which is this boundary] is not quite
  spacelike, whic causes dS [the induced area form] to degenrate to zero
  and $n_\beta$ [the normal] to elongate to infinity. But the area from
  $n_\beta dS$ remains well defined in the limit; we omit the standard
  details. I am aware that Stokes theorem is oblivious of the metric (that is, it works on any manifold, with or without metric). Furthermore, in this particular case the volume form in the lightcone coincides with the volume form given by the usual Euclidean metric, which we can use, and thus interpret the integral as an integral in Euclidean space; and then the induced metric is perfectly valid and I obtain the identity verbatim. It, however, worries me that this procedure probably doesn't extend to general Lorentz manifolds. Also, in the explanation given in the footnote he describes what seems to be another way to fix the problem, which apparently is standard but for which I haven't been able to find any reference. I guess I could integrate in a stretched out ""lightcone"" with a non-lightlike boundary and take limits as the boundary becomes lightlike; and this will probably give me the same answer, it however doesn't seem to be what he's describing (right?).

$$\int_{\gamma} \frac{1}{(z^2+1)^2(z^2+4)}=2\pi i \sum Res$$
so re-writing the integrand as $\displaystyle\frac{1}{(z-2i)(z+2i)(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}$ we can see that there is two simple poles at $2i$,$-2i$ and two poles of order 2 at $i$,$-i$. 
Calculating the residues:
$$Res_{z=2i}=\lim_{z\rightarrow 2i} \displaystyle\frac{1}{(z+2i)(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}=\frac{1}{36i}$$ $$Res_{z=-2i}=\lim_{z\rightarrow 2i} \displaystyle\frac{1}{(z-2i)(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}=\frac{-1}{36i}$$ $$Res_{z=i}\lim_{z\rightarrow i} \frac{d}{dz} \frac{1}{(z-2i)(z+2i)(z+i)^2}=\frac{2i}{36}+\frac{2}{24i}$$ $$Res_{z=-i}\lim_{z\rightarrow -i} \frac{d}{dz} \frac{1}{(z-2i)(z+2i)(z-i)^2}=\frac{-2i}{36}+\frac{-2}{24i}$$ But now the sum of the residues is 0 and so when I integrate over my curve letting R go to $\infty$ (and the integral over top semi-circle goes to 0) I will just get 0?

Then they say that if a non-associative ring (which means not necessarily associative) has multiplication satisfying this identity and the ring is semiprime , then it is both associative and commutative.

400,2012/04/24 00:00:21    lasted 2 seconds              so 400 for 2 seconds = ? kwh
300,2012/04/24 00:00:23    lasted 6 seconds              and so on....
90,2012/04/24 00:00:29     assume last record lasted 6 seconds I then work out the kwh per line and keep a running total of the kwh reading. Question is, which is more accurate, and would there be a massive difference in the accuracy of the two methods.","['statistics', 'average']"
137229,Norm inequality on Complex Numbers.,"For $z,w \in \mathbb{C}$, it is true that $ 2 | z w| \leq |z|^2 + |w|^2 $. How does this imply the identity: $$|z+w|^2 \leq 2(|z|^2 + |w|^2 )? $$","['inequality', 'complex-analysis']"
137233,The coarea formula for topological groups,"The classical coarea formula provides us a possibility to reduce the integration over some set to the integration over the slices of this set. For example, we can reduce the integration over a unit ball to the integration over spheres:
$$
   \int\limits_{B(0,1)} f(x) \, dx = \int\limits_{0}^{1} \int\limits_{S(0,t)} f(x)\,dS \, dt.
$$
I'm looking for the generalization of this result to the case of topological groups. For example, is there some similar formula that allows us to reduce the integral over $GL(n)$ to an integral over $O(n)$ and etc? I'm also looking for such decomposition of integral over the additive group of symmetric matrices. I want to reduce the integration to the integration over the set of eigenvalues.","['topological-groups', 'measure-theory', 'integration', 'fibration']"
137245,"An infinite finitely generated group contains an isometric copy of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., contains a bi-infinite geodesic","The question is: prove that an infinite finitely generated group $G$ contains an isometric copy of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., contains a bi-infinite geodesic ($G$ is equipped with the word metric). I do not even know what I have to prove. It does not make sense to me. The word metric of $G$ assumes values in the natural numbers. How could there be an isometry between a subgraph of the Cayley graph of $G$ and the real line $\mathbb{R}$. I am really confused. I found this question here (sheet 6, ex. 1).","['geometric-group-theory', 'group-theory']"
