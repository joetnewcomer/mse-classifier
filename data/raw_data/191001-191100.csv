3611312,Finding the triangle with the maximum area with a given perimeter,"Question: Of all triangles with a given perimeter, find the triangle with the maximum area. Justify your answer. My approach: Let us have any $\Delta ABC$ such that the sides opposite to $A$ is of length $a$ , the side opposite to $B$ is of length b and the side opposite to $C$ is of length $c$ . Now since the perimeter to $\Delta ABC$ is fixed, thus we must have $P=a+b+c$ to be constant. Now fix any side of the triangle, let us fix $BC$ . Therefore $b+c=P-a$ , which implies that $b+c$ is constant. Thus the locus of the point $A$ must be an ellipse having one of it's axis as the side $BC$ . Now let us select any point $A$ on the ellipse and drop a perpendicular to the axis $BC$ . Let it meet the major axis at $P$ . Now let $AP=h$ . Therefore, the area of the $\Delta ABC=\frac{1}{2}.h.BC=\frac{1}{2}.h.a.$ Now since $\frac{1}{2}a$ is constant, implies the area of $\Delta ABC$ can be maximized by maximizing $h$ . Now clearly $h$ attains it's maximum value when it coincides with the other axis of the ellipse under consideration, that is when $AB=AC$ . Thus $\Delta ABC$ must be isosceles with $AB=AC$ to get a maximum value of the area of $\Delta ABC$ . Thus it is clear that the triangle which will have the maximum area must be one of the isosceles triangles $ABC$ having $BC$ as the base. Thus in any such $\Delta ABC$ , we must have $a+b+c=a+2b \hspace{0.2 cm}(\because b=c)=P\implies b=\frac{1}{2}(P-a).$ Thus by Heron's formula we have $$|\Delta ABC|=\sqrt{\frac{P}{2}\left(\frac{P}{2}-a\right)\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)}=\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}.$$ Now to obtain the condition for maximizing $|\Delta ABC|$ we have to check when $\frac{d}{da}\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}=0.$ Now $$\frac{d}{da}\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}=0\\\iff (P-2a)^{1/2}-a(P-2a)^{-1/2}=0\\\iff P-2a=a\\\iff 3a=P\\\iff a=\frac{P}{3}.$$ Now note that $\frac{d^2}{da^2}|\Delta ABC|<0$ , which implies that $|\Delta ABC|$ attain it's maximum value when $a=\frac{P}{3}.$ This implies that $b=c=\frac{P}{3}$ . Thus we have $a=b=c=\frac{P}{3}$ . Therefore, $|\Delta ABC|$ is maximized if and only if $a=b=c$ , i.e, the triangle is equilateral. Can someone check if this solution is correct or not? And other solutions are welcomed. Please ensure that the solutions are based on geometry and one-variable calculus. This problem can be solved using Lagrange multipliers or multi-variable calculus, but I do not want a solution using the same.","['optimization', 'calculus', 'solution-verification', 'geometry']"
3611330,"The generality of ""neusis plus""","Consider the following progression of facts relating to geometric construction with a limited set of tools: With only a compass and unmarked straightedge, we can only construct numbers that lie in a tower of degree- $2$ field extensions of the rational numbers. We can only take square roots, and we cannot construct the heptagon. If we place two marks separated by a distance of $1$ on the straightedge, we obtain neusis. If we only place the marks on straight lines, the tower of extensions can now include degree- $3$ extensions . We can take cube roots, trisect the angle and construct the heptagon, but not the hendecagon. If we now allow placing the marks on a line and a circle or on two circles, degree- $5$ and $6$ extensions are available. We can construct the hendecagon. And so this question is about the logical next step in the progression. Suppose we can now transfer the distance between any two constructed points back onto the straightedge . Using this ""neusis plus"" system, can we construct all algebraic numbers? If not, what degrees of field extensions can we achieve? To illustrate the process of making new marks on the straightedge, suppose you have constructed two points separated by $\sqrt2$ . You can place the straightedge against those two points and, with a fine pencil, draw short lines from the points onto your straightedge. These marks are separated by exactly $\sqrt2$ and can be used for later neusis steps.","['polynomials', 'geometry', 'geometric-construction']"

3611468,Section continuity implies continuity,"We know that a function $f: R^2\to R$ that is section-continuous (that is each $x\mapsto f(x,y)$ and $ y\mapsto f(x,y)$ are continuous) need not be continuous. $f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}\chi_{\{0\}^c}$ is a counterexample for such a claim. However apparently if add the condition that $f$ maps compact sets to compact sets, then $f$ is continuous. Note the the converse is always true, that is continuous maps send compact sets to compact sets. I was wondering why that original condition is true? that is section continuous functions that send compact sets to compact sets must be continuous.","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"
3611495,"Asymptotic distribution of U-statistic based ""log-likelihood""","This is question 4.2c from John Duchi's course Stats 300b at Stanford: http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats300b/Exercises/all-exercises.pdf Consider the U-statistic-based ""Log-likelihood"" type objective: $$L_n(\theta) = {n \choose 2}^{-1} \sum_{i,j}^n 1\{Y_i > Y_j\} \log P_{\theta}(Y_i > Y_j | x_i, x_j) $$ where we have $n$ samples of $(Y_i, x_i)$ such that: $$Y_i = x_i^T \theta + \epsilon_i$$ $$\epsilon_i âˆ¼ N(0, 1)$$ $$E[x_i] = 0, Cov[x_i] = \Sigma$$ Let $\hat{\theta}_n = argmax_{\theta} L_n(\theta)$ and assuming that $\hat{\theta}_n$ is consistent for the true $\theta$ : Find the asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n$ . My approach has been (using theorem 5.23 from Asymptotic Statistics by Van der Vaart) to seek the asymptotic distribution of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta_n - \theta)$ which under suitable regularity conditions is asymptotically normal with mean $0$ and variance: $$V_\theta^{-1}E[\nabla L_n \nabla L_n^T]V_\theta^{-1}$$ where $V_\theta^{-1} = E[\nabla^2L_n]$ and expectation is taken with respect to data and derivatives are taken with respect to $\theta$ . My difficulty has been in evaluating these expectations to determine the variance of this estimator. $\nabla L_n$ looks like a U-statistic with kernel $h(x_1, x_2) = 1\{Y_i > Y_j\}\nabla_\theta \log P_{\theta}(Y_1 > Y_2 | x_1, x_2)$ . So, $\sqrt{n}(\nabla L_n - E[\nabla L_n])$ is asymptotically $N(0, 2^2\xi_1)$ where $\xi_1$ is the variance of : $$\xi_1 = Cov(h(X, X_i), h(X, X_j)) = E(h(X, X_i)h(X, X_j)) - E(h(X, X_i)) E(h(X, X_j))$$ But I'm also having trouble evaluating this covariance. EDIT: A friend showed me a few tricks, but I dont seem much closer to having a neat closed form (if there is one). At a closer look, $L_N$ is not a log-likelihood, so let's go after $V_\theta$ and $E[\nabla L_n \nabla L_n^T]$ to apply theorem 5.23 directly. First, we have: $$\log P_{\theta}(Y_i > Y_j | x_i, x_j) = \log P_{\theta}(\epsilon_j - \epsilon_i < (x_i - x_j)^T\theta | x_i, x_j) = \log \Phi \bigg(\frac{(x_i-x_j)^T\theta}{\sqrt2}\bigg)$$ Evaluating $\xi_1$ we have for the first moment: $$E(h(X, X_i)) = E [1_i\frac{(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)}{\Phi(\gamma_i)}]$$ where $\gamma_i = \frac{(X - X_i)^T\theta}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $1_i = 1\{Y > Y_i\}$ . By conditioning on the event in the indicator and applying the tower property of expectation: $$ = E [(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)] $$ which is equal to $0$ by symmetry. So, $$\xi_1 = E [(1_i\frac{(X - X_i)\phi(\gamma_i)}{\Phi(\gamma_i)})(1_j\frac{(X - X_j)\phi(\gamma_j)}{\Phi(\gamma_j)})^T]$$ Simplifying as before: $$= E [\phi(\gamma_i)\phi(\gamma_j)(X - X_i)(X - X_i)^T$$ Which I cannot simplify any further. Applying similar simplifications to $\nabla^2 L_n(\theta)$ we have: $$\nabla^2 L_n(\theta) = -\frac{\phi(\gamma_{ij})^2}{\Phi(\gamma_{ij})}(X_i-X_j)(X_i-X_j)^T/2$$ where $\gamma = \frac{(X_i-X_j)^T\theta}{\sqrt2}$ . EDIT: Using this expression to simulate the asymptotic variance, we get what we expect intuitively, this estimator works better than the least-squares estimator when the variance of the noise term $\epsilon$ is smaller than that of the covariates $x_i$ . The following log-log plot shows the relationship for the 1-D case between the variance and $var(\epsilon)$ where $x$ is sampled from $N(0,1)$ . The relationship is even more dramatic when $x\sim  cauchy$ . An interesting followup question would be: can we find a variance stabilizing transform, such that the asymptotic variance no longer depends on the parameter in question?","['weak-convergence', 'statistics', 'probability-theory', 'asymptotics']"

3611608,Why is the one quadratic polynomial a perfect square more often than the other?,"I was solving problem 137 of Project Euler, which led me to find $n$ such that $5n^2+2n+1$ is a perfect square. But such numbers are very rare (the 13th is around 3 billions) so after decomposing into $(n+1)^2 + (2n)^2 = m^2$ and looking for Pythagorean triples and their $(a^2-b^2,2ab,a^2+b^2)$ generation, I ended up having to look for $k$ such that $5k^2+4$ is a perfect square. This is a much easier task, which retrospectively makes sense since every $k$ will lead to some $n=O(k^2)$ , so you only need to iterate to $10^5$ to find the $13$ th number. Question So we proved that there are more squares in $5n^2+4$ than in $5n^2+2n+1$ . Was there an easier way to spot this without pulling out the Pythagorean triple trick?

3611807,Application of Blumenthal's Zero-One Law to Brownian Motion,"Let $W_t$ be a Brownian motion.

3611867,Showing a bijection between binary string sets.,"I am working on showing a bijection between two sets: $B^6$ and $E_{10}$ . Here is the problem: Let $B = {0, 1}$ . $B^n$ is the set of binary strings with $n$ bits. Define the set $E_n$ to be the set of binary strings with $n$ bits that have an even number of 1's. Note that zero is an even number, so a string with zero 1's (i.e., a string that is all 0's) has an even number of 1's. Show a bijection between $B^9$ and $E_{10}$ . Explain why your function is a bijection. Here is my answer: Suppose $x \in B^9$ . We know an odd number is the result of an even number plus an odd number. Since there are only 9 digits for each $x \in B^9$ , and 9 is an odd number, this means that if there are an odd number of 1â€™s in x then there will be an even number of 0â€™s in x. Further, if there are an even number of 1â€™s in x then there will be an odd number of 0â€™s in x. Therefore, each $x \in B^9$ will have either an odd or even amount of 1â€™s. We could write a function f to say that if x has an odd number of 1â€™s, then append a 1, which would give us an even number of 1â€™s. We could also say that if x has an even number of 1â€™s than append a 0, which would then keep the number of 1â€™s even. Assuming each $x \in B^9$ is unique, according to our function we will be adding either a 1 or a 0 to the end of the string, which would produce a new unique string with 10 bits. For example, $f(100011000)=1000110001$ . This means that the function is injective (one-to-one) function because each element in the domain is mapped to 1 distinct element in the codomain. We can also have an inverse function $f^{-1}$ which removes the last binary digit from each $y \in E_{10}$ . $E_{10}$ is defined to be the set where each element from $B^9$ has a 1 or 0 appended to it, and thus producing a distinct element. Removing the end 1 or 0 from this new string produces the distinct unique element that was in $B^9$ . For example, $f^{-1}(1000110001)=100011000$ . This means each element in $E_{10}$ can be mapped to at least one unique $x \in B^9$ , meaning the function is onto Since the function is both one-to-one and onto, then it is a bijection. I feel like there is a much simpler way of showing this, and not really sure if I made a good case in the first place. I was hoping someone could provide a different way to think about this problem or provide some insight so that I can formulate a better answer. Thank you all so much!",['discrete-mathematics']

3612276,Diagram of equivalences in modular representation theory,"Years ago I had found (and printed) a big list of all equivalences used in modular representation theory (and block theory), with arrows denoting the various implications (for instance, Morita equivalence -> Derived equivalence). At the top there were strong things like isomorphism of source algebras, and at the bottom ""Isomorphism of centers"" and "" $k(B)=k(C)$ "" (the number of ordinary characters in the block). It was a vertical diagram, with many ramifications and, I'd say, more than $20$ different properties listed. Sadly, due to the lockdown that diagram is now on the wall of my office in a building closed until further notice... and I was not able to find it again. Long shot, but does anyone know what I am talking about? I am 99% sure that it was part of a survey paper, or a survey chapter in a book.

3612297,Compute the expected number of tiles needed filled to fill a row in a grid,"I want to compute the expected number of tiles I would have to fill to fill a row of $n$ tiles in a $n\times k$ -grid. No tiles can be filled more than once. In other words, if we fill a tile in a $n\times k$ -grid each turn with uniform probability and if $X$ is the number of turns needed to fill a row of $n$ tiles in the grid, what is $E[X]$ ? I have tried with some small examples. For example for a $2\times 3$ -grid, I reason as follows: 
It does not matter which tile we fill first.  Then it is a one in five chance to pick the same row as the first one, so the probability of filling a row in two turns is $\frac{1}{5}$ . To complete a row in three turns, we need to fill a tile in a different row, and then in one of the same. To complete a row in four turns, we need to fill a tile in each different row, then any tile we fill will complete a row. 
We get the following table: $$\begin{array}{c|c|} 
   & \text{Probability to fill a row in $x$ turns} \\ \hline
\text{P(X=2)} & \frac{1}{5} \\ \hline
\text{P(X=3)} & \frac{4}{5}\cdot\frac{2}{4} \\ \hline
\text{P(X=4)} & \frac{4}{5}\cdot\frac{2}{4}\cdot1
\end{array}$$ From here we can calculate the expected value as $E[X] = 2\cdot\frac{1}{5}+3\cdot\frac{2}{5}+4\cdot\frac{2}{5} = \frac{16}{5}$ , so we expect to complete a row in a little more than 3 turns. It quickly gets convoluted with larger examples though, and I can't find a pattern. I know factorials in the denominators are involved in probabilities, because the number of tiles to choose to fill decreases by one each time. I have not been able to find any similar sounding questions. In this question they answer something related, namely what the probability of filling a row of 10 after 20 turns in a $7\times10$ -grid. I feel like this might be of some help, but I am not able to generalize the solution provided there. Furthermore this does not answer what the expected number of turns to fill a row in a given grid is. It would also be interesting to see what kind of probability distribution this process has. Intuitively I think this shares some similarities with the geometric distribution, but not directly. I thought of this problem when doing a picture puzzle, and wondered how many puzzle pieces one would need to expect a row to be filled.","['puzzle', 'expected-value', 'combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"
3612325,Intuition behind tangent space to a point on a manifold,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $p \in M$ . We have a notion of a ""tangent space"" of $p$ , i.e. a vector space structure around $p$ to give us the idea, roughly, or ""directions we can travel in"" from $p$ , which an abstract manifold need not have inherently. I want to get a sense of the intuition behind what exactly a tangent vector is and how it's defined, and I break this up into four questions. 1) What is the purpose behind defining a tangent space? As I will write below, tangent vectors are defined in terms of directional derivative operators evaluated at $p$ . Is the only use behind tangent vectors to be able to take directional derivative? We might define a ""direction"" in our tangent space to be an operator that produces the directional derivative of a $C^{\infty}$ function in that ""direction"". Intuitively, this notion of direction doesn't look useful for doing anything other than taking directional derivatives; is that indeed the case? 2) Geometric Interpretation How would one visualize a tangent space? Say, for simplicity of picturing, that our manifold is actually a $k$ -submanifold in Euclidean space. In this case, isn't the tangent space every single vector in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ ? How does this compare with visualizing the tangent space as a parallelepiped? 3) Definition 1: Smooth Curves We might define the tangent space as the equivalence class of all smooth curves $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to M$ with $\gamma(0) = p$ , where two smooth curves $\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}$ are equivalent if $(\varphi \circ \gamma_{1})'(0) = (\varphi \circ \gamma_{2})'(0)$ . In this sense, each equivalence class defines a ""direction"" about $p$ , which helps us take directional derivatives. If $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function, then $(f \circ \gamma)'(0)$ (differentiated in the ordinary sense, which makes sense here) is the directional derivative of $f$ in direction $\gamma$ . I again come back to my question of what use direction $\gamma$ is serving other than giving us directional derivatives. Now, I give the other definition, and want to know why these two definitions are exactly the same: 4) Definition 2: Directional Derivative Operator Note - This is often given in terms of ""derivations"" (linear maps that satisfy a generalized product rule, or Liebniz's rule): But a (non-trivial) result tells us that derivations are nothing but directional derivatives, so I stick to talking about directional derivatives here. Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote $C^{\infty}(M, \mathbb{R}$ ), i.e. smooth functions $M \to \mathbb{R}$ . Let $D_{\gamma}: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the operator s.t. $D_{\gamma}(f) = (f \circ \gamma)'(0)$ , where $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to M$ is a smooth curve with $\gamma(0) = p$ , as above .We can define an equivalence relation (similar to what we did above) and define our tangent space to be all these ""directional derivative operators"" (that take a function and spit out its derivative in the direction of a smooth curve). In this sense, each ""direction"" in our tangent space is basically one of these operators. How is our notion of direction here same as the notion of direction we obtained in 3)? In one case, a curve (under equivalence relation) is our direction, while in this case, an operator (defined using a curve, but nevertheless different) is our direction. Further, this again brings me back to my question on whether direction and directional derivative can be used synonymously in this context.

Continue this process for all $a \in A$ and thus we've shown $X \setminus A$ is open and hence that $A$ is closed. $\square$ My guess is that when we say ""continue this process"" that's where some subtlety lies which would show that this proof is incorrect, but I can't say what that subtlety is.

Question: The point $\eta$ is regular (i.e, $\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ is a regular local ring) if and only if there is at least one closed point $x\in Y$ that is regular on $X$ . The if part of the question is true due to a theorem of Serre: The localization of a regular local ring is a regular local ring. Because, if the variety $Y$ is defined by the prime ideal $P$ inside an affine chart containing $x$ , then $(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})_{P\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}=\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ . So I am interested in the only if part. Notice that any algebraic variety has at least one regular closed point (cf. the book of Liu, section 4.2 Lemma 2.21, where it is proved over any field under the assumption of $X$ being geometrically reduced). Hence, $Y$ has at least one closed point $x$ such that $\mathcal{O}_{Y,x}$ is regular. As we are assuming that $\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ is regular as well maybe some kind of transitivity of the regular property (in the sense of this other question that I asked before) would imply that the point $x$ is regular in $X$ .

Therefore, we have: $~$ $-\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5}$ Let, $5-x=u$ and $5-x^2=v$ , we have : $$u-v=x^2-x \\ v^2-v =x^2-x \\v^2-v-x^2+x=0 \\ (x-v)(x+v)-(x-v)=0 \\ (x-v)(x+v-1)=0 \\ x_1=v, ~~~ x_2=1-v$$ Then, we have $$\begin{cases}x=5-x^2 \\ -\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5} \end {cases} \Longrightarrow \begin{cases}x^2+x-5=0 \\ -\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5} \end {cases} \Longrightarrow x=\dfrac{\sqrt {21}-1}{2}$$ $$\begin{cases}x=1-(5-x^2) \\ -\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5} \end {cases} \Longrightarrow \begin{cases}x^2-x-4=0 \\ -\sqrt{5} < x < \sqrt{5} \end {cases} \Longrightarrow x=\dfrac{1- \sqrt {17}}{2}$$ So, we get: $$\color{red}{x= \left\{  \dfrac{\sqrt {21}-1}{2}, \dfrac{1- \sqrt {17}}{2} \right\}}$$ $\color{black}{\text{Method} \thinspace  2:}$ Actually a ""copy"" of Method $1$ .

3612971,Why do we take into consideration the probability of the events that are more extreme than the observed value in hypothesis testing?,"I am currently learning about hypothesis testing and I really don't understand why do we take into consideration the probability of the events to the left and to the right of the observed value (or just to the left, or just to the right in the cases when we are interested if a parameter is only greater or smaller than the hypothesized value of the parameter). So it is clear enough that we take into consideration the probability of the observed value, but why do we also take into consideration the probability of the events that are more extreme than the observed value ? It seems to me that if we also take into consideration the events that are more extreme than the observed value, we are overestimating the p-value. I understand that we couldn't consider only the observed value if we are talking about a continuous distribution, since in that case we have to find the area under the curve to find the probability, and we would find the area of a line which would be $0$ . But we could consider a small interval or something like that. And in the case of a discrete distribution we wouldn't have this problem, but we still take into consideration the events that are more extreme than the observed value. So why does this work? I would really appreciate it if you could explain it like you would explain it to someone who is just starting with statistics, since that is the position that I am in.","['statistics', 'hypothesis-testing']"

3613078,"What captures our intuitive notion of faces, edges, and vertices?","This answer suggests that laypeople's intuitive notion of the meaning of these words is consistent with the following claims: A cube has 6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices.

By a factorial number I mean a positive integer for which there exists a whole number $n$ such that the factorial number is equal to $n!$ . In set theoretic language, this question is considering elements in the intersection of these two sets of numbers. One can quickly generate and test (brute force) search for such values. Here's a quick-and-simple example of such an algorithm. from math import factorial

while 1:
    f = factorial(n)
    if len(set(str(f))) != 10:

Then $H^i(X, F)$ is the right derived functors of the global sections functor. However, there are at least three different global sections functors that we can take derived functors of: Forget the ringed space structure and just consider $X$ as a topological space and $F$ is a sheaf of abelian groups. Then, the global sections functor is $Ab(X) \rightarrow Ab$ . If $F$ has an $O_X$ -module structure, then we have another global sections functor $O_X-mod \rightarrow O_X(X)-mod$ . That is: the category of sheaves $O_X$ -modules to the category of $O_X(X)$ -modules We can also restrict (2) to the case where $F$ is quasicoherent. That is: we have a functor $QCoh(X) \rightarrow O_X(X)-mod$ . My question is: what is the relationship between them? Injective objects in the category of quasicoherent sheaves is not the same as injective objects in the category of sheaves of $O_X$ -modules, see here for an example. Hartshorne's proposition III.2.6 states that the derived functors $O_X-mod$ to $Ab$ coincide with the cohomology functor. Does this mean that (2) and (1) result in the same cohomology groups, after applying the forgetful functor? If $X$ is an affine scheme, then the global sections functor is exact. This would imply that the $H^i(X, F)$ for $i \geq 1$ is 0 for the third global sections functor.

3613719,17 definitions of algebraic K-theory of a ring. Which should I take?,"There are multiple definitions of algebraic K-theory, but I have trouble differentiating between them. Could someone help me out? Let $R$ be a commutative ring. I would like to define $K_n(R)$ , and for simplicity $n \geq 0$ is OK for me now. The plus construction gives us $B\operatorname{GL}(R)^+$ , whose homotopy groups give me $K_n(R)$ for all $n \geq 0$ . The Q-construction takes as input an exact category $\mathcal{C}$ . At this point we can pick the finitely generated $R$ -modules, or the projective finitely generated $R$ -modules, or the finitely generated free $R$ -modules, or the coherent $R$ -modules. This gives us four K-theory groups $K_n(R)$ for $n \geq 0$ . All the exact categories give Waldhausen categories, to which we can apply the S-construction, yielding four more K-groups. Segal's construction involving $\Gamma$ -spaces takes in a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ . We can take any of the above categories, along with two choices of monoidal structure, namely $\otimes$ or $\oplus$ , yielding another eight K-theory groups $K_n(R)$ for $n \geq 0$ . Ideally, I'd like to see these definitions compared to modern ones. I've been told that one should think of algebraic K-theory as an $\infty$ -group completion procedure, but I have yet to find a readable reference on this.","['algebraic-k-theory', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'homotopy-theory']"

3613868,Should we teach congruences from the start rather than normal subgroups in group theory? [closed],"Closed . This question is opinion-based . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 4 years ago . Improve this question Many students have difficulty initially with the idea of a quotient group, and why a normal subgroup is defined as it is. I think this is potentially made worse by the slightly obscure logic of the subject as presented via normal subgroups. Could we not teach it more naturally by beginning with the notion of a congruence on a group $G$ , i.e. an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $G$ such that if $g\sim g'$ and $h\sim h'$ then $gh\sim g'h'$ . It seems to me much clearer that the equivalence classes of a congruence form a group $G/\sim$ than the fact that the cosets of a normal subgroup do. We could then show that every equivalence class of a congruence is the coset of a particular associated normal subgroup. I'm wondering what people's thoughts are on the pros and cons of this presentation? *See the bottom answer here for the kind of explanation I'm talking about Is there any intuitive understanding of normal subgroup? *Depending on your position, this might not seem like an advantage, but in monoids (or semigroups) the equivalence between congruences and 'normal' submonoids is false, and we have to work with congruences. However, quotients in less algebraic contexts as well, e.g. topology, require an equivalence relation, rather than a subobject.","['group-theory', 'normal-subgroups', 'congruence-relations', 'education']"

Namely: Is every group $G$ a subgroup of index $2$ of some $\tilde G$ ? I think that's true, based on the following. Let $G$ be a group and $X_G$ a set such that: $X_G\cap G=\emptyset$ ; there is a bijection $\alpha\colon X_G\to G$ . Let's define $\tilde G:=G\cup X_G$ and $\cdot : \tilde G\times\tilde G \to \tilde G$ by: \begin{alignat}{1}

The end of chapter questions have escalated in difficulty, so I just want to make sure that I am on the right track. Suppose $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ are sets. Prove that $A \vartriangle B \subseteq C$ iff $A \cup C = B \cup C$ . Proof: Suppose $A \vartriangle B \subseteq C$ . Let $x$ be arbitrary. Suppose $x \in A \cup C$ , then either $x \in A$ or $x \in C$ . We consider these two cases: Case 1. $x \in A$ . Suppose $x \notin B \cup C$ . So $x \notin B$ and $x \notin C$ . Since $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$ , $x \in A\setminus B$ . It follows that $x \in A \setminus B \cup B \setminus A$ , so $x \in A \vartriangle B$ . Since $A \vartriangle B \subseteq C$ and $x \in A \vartriangle B $ , $x \in C$ . But then we have $x \in C$ and $x \notin C$ , which is a contradiction. Thus, $x \in B \cup C$ Case 2. $x \in C$ . It immediately follows that $x \in B \cup C$ . In every case, we have shown that $x \in B \cup C$ . The proof of $x \in B \cup C \implies x \in A \cup C$ will be similar, but with the roles of $A$ and $B$ switched. Therefore, $A \cup C = B \cup C$ . Now suppose $A \cup C = B \cup C$ . Let $x \in A \vartriangle B$ be arbitrary. Then $x \in A \setminus B \cup B \setminus A$ , which means that $x \in A \setminus B$ or $x \in B \setminus A$ . We consider these two cases: Case 1. $x \in A \setminus B$ . Then $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$ . Suppose $x \notin C$ . Then since $x \notin B$ and $x \notin C$ , $x \notin B \cup C$ . Since $x \in A$ , $x \in A \cup C$ . Then since $A \cup C = B \cup C$ , $x \in B \cup C$ . But then we have $x \in B \cup C$ and $x \notin B \cup C$ , which is a contradiction. Thus, $x \in C$ . Case 2. $x \in B \setminus A$ . By similar reasoning as case 1 with $A$ and $B$ switched, we also find that $x \in C$ . In every case, we have shown that $x \in C$ . Since $x$ was arbitrary, it follows that $A \vartriangle B \subseteq C$ . Therefore, $A \vartriangle B \subseteq C$ iff $A \cup C = B \cup C$ . $\square$","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification']"
3614107,How do you create a custom probability density function from a discrete distribution?,"I have some data that follows some unknown probability function.

I then use interpolation to create my cumulative distribution function (or at least I think so). But here I am stuck. I know I have to normalize the distribution somehow, but simply dividing by the number of data points does not seem to do the trick (read: something is completely wrong). How do I do this? Is there a better approach? I would like to implement all of this in Python. Here is my code so far: import numpy as np

plt.plot(bin_centers, fit(bin_centers), label='fit')
plt.hist(distr.rvs(size=100), 100, density=True, label='data from fit')
plt.legend()
plt.show() In order to be able to draw random variates from this distribution later on, I also need to implement the inverse cdf / _ppf() , according to the rv_continuous documentation . EDIT So I have been able to draw some random variates from the fit, but it takes incredibly long. The main reason seems to be that in order to draw the variates, I need to have a properly implemented inverse cdf / _ppf() . From the documentation of rv_continuous : The default method _rvs relies on the inverse of the cdf, _ppf, applied to a uniform random variate. In order to generate random variates efficiently, either the default _ppf needs to be overwritten (e.g. if the inverse cdf can expressed in an explicit form) or a sampling method needs to be implemented in a custom _rvs method. Because I don't have that, the cdf is created by integrating over the pdf, but for some reason, the integral does not seem to converge: IntegrationWarning: The maximum number of subdivisions (50) has been achieved.
  If increasing the limit yields no improvement it is advised to analyze 
  the integrand in order to determine the difficulties.  If the position of a 
  local difficulty can be determined (singularity, discontinuity) one will 
  probably gain from splitting up the interval and calling the integrator 
  on the subranges.  Perhaps a special-purpose integrator should be used. So I guess I need a good way to create my own implementation of at least the cdf, but better yet of the inverse cdf.","['python', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions']"

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 4 years ago . Improve this question EDIT: Much thanks for answers. As was pointed out, the question as it stands is a little too broad. Nevertheless, I don't want to delete it, because I think that such introduction-style questions can be answered without writing a book, rather something more like an introduction to a book and fits here. Moreover, commenters have linked to great resources, and this question might help someone else. I made a follow up strictly narrower question instead. First some background, so that you know where I came from. But the question in the title stands as it is, if you want to answer without appealing to what is below, please do. I am currently learning about Lie groups. One of the first things that I've seen are the classical groups , and the classical group that I want to talk about today is the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(n,\mathbb{F})$ . The definition of $\mathrm{Sp}(n,\mathbb{F})$ I am familiar with is as follows: Let $\omega$ be an skew-symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb{F}^{2n}$ , which is unique up to change of basis. It is given by the formula $$\omega(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n{x_iy_{i+n}-y_ix_{i+n}}$$ Why is this symplectic form important? We can then write out the definition $$\mathrm{Sp}(n,\mathbb{F}) = \left\{ A: \mathbb{F}^{2n} \to \mathbb{F}^{2n} \mid \omega(A\mathbf{x},A\mathbf{y}) = \omega(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) \text{ for all } \mathbf{x,y} \in \mathbb{F}^{2n}\right\}$$ I can see the analogue of $O(n,\mathbb{F})$ . We also have some bilinear form that needs to be preserved, namely the inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ . But more importantly, elements of $O(n,\mathbb{F})$ are really easy to visualize, because I intuitively know what a rigid transformation is. So the important question for me is How to visualize symplectic transformations? And I tried to research this question, and I stumbled upon the topic of symplectic linear spaces and symplectic manifolds . A symplectic vector space is defined analogous to Euclidean vector space, but the inner product is again substituted by symplectic form. What is a symplectic vector space, intuitively? I saw that the intuition behind these things should be that $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ should be treated as a space of positions and velocities , a phase space . And I don't understand it. But I feel that physical intuition would be really helpful. What is the connection of classical mechanics with symplectic geometry? I don't know classical mechanics, sadly, so a quick mathematical rundown would be appreciated. All the questions that I've asked above could be summarized to one question: What is symplectic geometry?","['symplectic-geometry', 'classical-mechanics', 'linear-algebra', 'symplectic-linear-algebra', 'lie-groups']"
3614250,The Hodge diamond of a Calabi-Yau Fourfold,"I am studying the String Theory book by Becker, Becker, and Schwarz, and I decided to verify the Hodge diamonds for a CY3 and a CY4. These can be found on page 365 and they are eq.(9.14) and (9.16). It was very easy for me to derive the precise form of the Hodge diamond following what they mention in the book. A problem arose when I tried to repeat the computation for the case of a CY4. Let me first state the problem/question. Why for a CY4 the Hodge number $h^{2,0}$ is equal to zero? This is not obvious to me from the relations they give in the book. Allow me to show you how I have worked out the rest of the elements of the Hodge diamond. Let me write here the properties the book gives for the Hodge numbers. For a Calabi-Yau n-fold we have that -these are eq.(9.10)-(9.12) in the book $\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h^{p,0} &= h^{n-p,0} \\
h^{p,q} &= h^{q,p} \\
h^{p,q} &= h^{n-q,n-p}
\end{split}
\end{equation}$ and we know that for a simply connected manifold $h^{1,0}=h^{0,1}=0$ and that a compact connected Kahler manifold has $h^{0,0}=1$ . From the first of the above properties, we have the following relations $\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&h^{4,3} = h^{3,4}, \qquad h^{4,2} = h^{2,4}, \qquad h^{4,1} = h^{1,4}, \qquad h^{4,0} = h^{0,4}, \qquad \qquad h^{3,2} = h^{2,3}, \qquad h^{3,1} = h^{1,3}, \\
&h^{3,0} = h^{0,3}, \qquad h^{2,1} = h^{1,2}, \qquad h^{2,0} = h^{0,2}, \qquad h^{1,0} = h^{0,1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}$ From the second property we have $\begin{equation}
h^{4,0} = h^{0,0} \qquad h^{3,0} = h^{1,0}
\end{equation}$ And finally, from the third one we obtain $\begin{equation} 
h^{4,4} = h^{0,0}, \qquad h^{4,3} = h^{1,0}, \qquad h^{4,2} = h^{2,0}, \qquad h^{4,1} = h^{1,0}, \qquad h^{3,3} = h^{1,1}, \qquad h^{3,2} = h^{2,1}.
\end{equation}$ The undetermined $h^{2,2}$ is given by -see eq.(9.17) $\begin{equation}
h^{2,2} = 2 (22+2h^{1,1}+2h^{1,3}-h^{1,2})
\end{equation}$ If we impose all of the above to the Hodge diamond we get precisely what is shown in the book with the only difference that in the book they seem to have that $h^{2,0}=0$ which I cannot obtain.","['algebraic-geometry', 'homology-cohomology', 'de-rham-cohomology', 'differential-geometry']"

I will only provide one more piece of information about the motivation at this time, feel free to ask if you are curious in the comments. The basic idea is to figure out if it's possible to show that the critical line, $Im(z)=\frac{1}{2}$ , corresponds somehow to the ""line at infinity"" in the projective plane (EDIT: Here is one way to view the complex plane as a projective plane: consider a 3-dimensional real space and imagine a unit sphere centered at the origin. Construct the projective plane using the standard definition of the set of all lines passing through the origin. Project all points of 3-d space onto the surface of this sphere with this construction in a 2-1 way; then project all the  points on the surface of this sphere (except for one) onto the complex plane using the Riemann sphere projection.)","['riemann-zeta', 'general-topology', 'projective-geometry', 'projective-space']"

3614692,The relationship between different cohomology theories of varieties and manifolds.,"I am reading some books about etale cohomology theory. I found there are some theorems which are very similar with the topological theorems. For example, there are Poincare Duality theorems for both schemes and manifolds. So my first question is if there are relationships between the theorems of schemes and manifolds. We know that for general topological spaces, we could consider the sheaf cohomology. So I wonder if we could consider etale coholomgy theories for manifolds? In other words, could we generalize etale cohomology for manifolds? Now, when we consider the varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ , we have three different cohomology theories: singular cohomology, sheaf cohomology and etale cohomology. I feel they are all equivalent, although I can not describe what the equivalence exactly means. So my next question is if there is any method to describe the equivalence between these three cohomology theory for complex varieties. I also notice for manifolds we have singular homology theories. However, when I study algebraic geometry, there are all cohomology theories, such as sheaf cohomology, Cech cohomology, etale cohomology, etc. I wonder if there are some homology theories for schemes? Why we do not consider homology for schemes? I think these are soft problems and may do not have exact answers. So could you explain some ideas  or recommend some books for me to read? Thank you very much for your help.","['etale-cohomology', 'soft-question', 'algebraic-geometry', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology']"

Suppose that $0 \notin \sigma_p(K)$ , then it must be that there exists some sequence $(\lambda_j)_{j\ge 1}\in \sigma_p(K)$ such that $\lim_{j\to \infty}\lambda_j = 0 $ . But since $0$ is an isolated point of the spectrum , such sequence cannot exists. Hence , $0\in \sigma_p(K)$ . Also, Since $H$ is separable let $(e_n)_{n\ge 1}$ be the orthonormal basis then since $\lambda =0$ is an eigenvalue of $K$ , we have that $\forall e_n \implies K(e_n)=0(e_n)$ , so all basis vectors (which are countably infinite) can be the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue $0$ , so dimension of the eigenspace is also infinite.","['compact-operators', 'analysis', 'solution-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'spectral-theory']"

it's the quantity that measures volume that crosses a surface per unit time? Is this a misunderstanding? is this the definition of flow rate? Is flow rate and flow the same thing in the field of velocity of a fluid? Is the mass ( or volume) of the fluid bond to the vectorial field in a fluid, or I can just pick the velocity of a point in the fluid without considering the mass? Is flow rate the dual of current for an electromagnetic field? How is current related to flux? Maybe the key is the divergence theorem...

Subtracting $a$ from both sides gives us $\sin\theta = -a$ , and one solution is easily seen to be $\theta = \arcsin(-a)$ . However, because $-1 < -a < 1$ , there should be two possible values of $\theta$ that give $\sin\theta = -a$ . I'll call the one we already found $\theta_1$ , and the one we are looking for $\theta_2$ . The best explanation I could think of is, when looking at the unit circle, $\sin\theta_1$ is considered the $y$ coordinate on the circle, while $\cos\theta_1$ is the corresponding $x$ coordinate. However, if you reflected across the $y$ axis, that other angle will also satisfy $\sin\theta_2 = -a$ . This reflection across the $y$ axis corresponds to $\theta_2 = \pi - \theta_1$ , and this is correct, because $$\sin\theta_2 = \sin(\pi - \theta_1) = \sin\pi + \sin\theta_1 = 0 -a = -a.$$ So we have our two solutions: $$\theta_1 = \arcsin(-a) \\ \theta_2 = \pi - \arcsin(-a).$$ My problem is I feel like my solution is too ""wordy"" and not elegant enough. Maybe it's not possible, but is there a better, more analytic way of deriving this result?

You can prove this claim using uniform boundedness principle, or you can just use Riesz Representation Theorem. See [this post][1]. Now, let's go back to your problem. It follows from the claim above that each row of $A$ is in $\ell_2$ . Define $T_N$ to be the restriction of $A$ onto the first $N$ rows, that is, $$T_N x = \left(\sum_j a_{1j}x_j,\sum_j a_{2j}x_j,\dots,\sum_j a_{Nj}x_j,0,0,\dots,\right).$$ We claim that $\|T_N\| < \infty$ .

Now, for each fixed $x$ , observe that $\|T_Nx\|_2$ is uniformly bounded by $\|Ax\|_2$ (since $\|T_Nx\|_2$ is just part of the sum for $\|Ax\|_2<\infty$ ). It follows from the uniform boundedness principle that $\sup_N \|T_N\|<\infty$ . Note that $\|Ax\|_2 = \lim_{N\to\infty} \|T_Nx\|_2 \leq (\sup_N \|T_N\|)\|x\|$ , which implies that $A$ is bounded and $\|A\| \leq \sup_N \|T_N\|$ . But I do not understand this step: $\sum_{i=1}^N \left|\sum_j a_{ij}x_j\right|^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\sum_j |a_{ij}|^2 \right)\left(\sum_j |x_j|^2 \right)$ I know that this is by Cauchy-Schwartz, but should not $a_{ij}x_j$ be inside an absolute value to apply Cauchy Schwartz?","['proof-explanation', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'cauchy-schwarz-inequality', 'functional-analysis']"

By definition, if $\nu$ is a normalised discrete valuation, then $\exists M\in \mathbb{P}_{L/\mathbb{Q}}$ a place of the algebraic function field $L$ , such that $M=(t)$ and $\nu=\nu_t$ , where $$\mathbb{P}_{L/\mathbb{Q}}:=\{M\subset L\mid \exists R \ \text{valuation ring of}\ L:\mathbb{Q}\subset R\subset L, M\ \text{maximal ideal of}\ R\},$$ and $\nu_t(a):=\max\{j\ge 0\mid p^j\vert a\}$ is the normalised valuation of $t$ . Thank you very much in advance for your help!","['field-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'valuation-theory', 'extension-field']"
