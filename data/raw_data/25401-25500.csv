229077,"A set in a $\sigma$-algebra that can't be ""reached"" with countable set-theoretical operations","Can someone please give me an example of a set that lies in a $\sigma$-algebra generated by some set other then the $\sigma$-algebra itself, such that this (the first) set can't be obtained by performing countably many set theoretical operations ? (Obviously with ""example of a set"" I mean ""prove that such a set exist"", since this set probably isn't obtainable in a constructive way.) I'm asking this since I've heard countless times, that generally the elements of a $\sigma$-algebra are not really constructively reachable.",['measure-theory']
229083,The cross product of two sets,"Just reading about the cross product. It says here:
$$A\times B= \{(x,y)|x\in A, y\in B\}$$
Does this mean that the result of $A\times B$ is a new set of ordered pairs? If so, what happens if both A and B share a common member? What would the result be, since an ordered pair cannot include duplicates? Edit: Quoting the free textbook I'm looking at online, If we are given that A is a set and no other information about A, then there is no
  ordering to the elements of A. Thus, we cannot speak of “the second element of the set A”
  unless we have specified an ordering of the elements of A. If we wish to regard A as ordered in some way, then we specify this fact explicitly: “The elements of A are ordered a, b, c,” or “A = (a, b, c).” The latter notation replaces the braces with parentheses and designates that A is ordered, left to right, as indicated. We call this an ordered set. An ordered set is also called a linear order. Various other names are also used: list, vector, string, word — all with no repeated elements. Of course, you’ve seen repeated elements in vectors, for example the point in the plane at the coordinates (1,1). That’s fine, it’s just not an ordered set. Why is it okay to specify a set S = {a, b, c, a} where the element a has been repeated,
  but it is not okay to have repeated elements in an ordering of S?   When we say S  =
  {a, b, c, a}, we know that S contains just the three elements a, b and c.  If we were to talk
  about the ordered set (a, b, c, a) it would not make sense because it would say that the
  element a is in two places at once: the first position and the last position.",['elementary-set-theory']

229102,Why are these all the indecomposable projective modules?,"Let $A$ be a finite dimensional associative algebra with unit over a commutative field $k$. Suppose that $M$ is a finitely generated left module. Denote by $I(M)$ the injective hull of $M$ and by $P(M)$ the projective cover of $M$. Suppose that $\{S_i\}_{1\leq i\leq n}$ is the set of all nonisomorphic simple $A$-modules (why is it finite?). Then $\{P(S_i)\}_i$ are all nonisomorphic indecomposable projective modules and $\{I(S_i)\}_i$ all nonisomorphic indecomposable injective modules, why is this true? I'm also wondering why there exist the projective covers? If I call $\mathrm{top}\;M$ the factor module $M/\mathrm{rad}\;M$ where $\mathrm{rad}\;M$ is the radical of $M$, then why $\mathrm{top}\;P(S_i)\cong\;S_i\cong\mathrm{soc}\;I(S_i)$?

229121,$\{z\in C:|z| = |\operatorname{re}(z)| +|\operatorname{im}(z)|\}$ open or closed [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Closed 11 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Proving that a complex set in open/closed/neither and bounded/not bounded I think $\{z\in C:|z| = |\operatorname{re}(z)| +|\operatorname{im}(z)|\}$ is closed. But I have no idea how to show it since you have to take an element of the set (which lies on the axes) and take a neighbourhood around that (not all of the ball is within the set so it's not open). But when you do the complement, not all of everything outside of the axes includes the ball (as some of the ball is on the axes). This would make it neither open nor closed but I'm sure it's closed!

229165,Cantor set - a question about being metrizable and about the connected components,"I have a question regarding Cantor set given to me as a homework question (well, part of it): a. Prove that the only connected components of Cantor set are the
  singletons $\{x\}$ where $x\in C$ b. Prove that $C$ is metrizable I am having some problems with this exercise: My thoughts about $a$: I know that in general path connectedness and connectedness are not
equivalent, but I know that$\mathbb{R}$ is path connected, I want
to say something like that since if $\gamma(t):C\to C$ is continues
then $\gamma(t)\equiv x$ for some $x\in C$ then I have it that the
connected components of $C$ can be only the singltons. But I lack any justification - connectedness and path connectedness
are not the same thing - but maybe since $\mathbb{R}$ is path connected
we can justify somehow that if $C$ had any connected component then
it is also path connected ? another thing that confuses me is that
the open sets relative to $C$ and relative to $\mathbb{R}$ are not
the same so I am also having a problem working with the definition
of when a space is called connected My thoughts about b: Myabe there is something that I don't understand
- but isn't $C$ metrizable since its a subspace of a $[0,1]$ with

229179,Volume and diagonal length of the Hilbert cube,"Here's something sort of fun that I gave thought to a while ago, and now that I've done some maturing mathematically I'm curious to see if my musings are legitimate. Let $H=[0,1] \times [0,\frac{1}{2}] \times [0,\frac{1}{3}] \times \cdots$ be the Hilbert cube.  What are the volume and diagonal length of $H$? If we try to calculate the volume in a fashion analogous to calculating the volume of a square (2-cube) or ordinary cube (3-cube), by multiplying the edge lengths, then $\text{Vol}(H)=1\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdots$ would seem to be 0 in the limit.  However, the usual Lebesgue measure does not have an analogue in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$.  How do we obtain an appropriate notion of volume here? Now let's call the diagonal of $H$ the line from the point $(0,0,...)$ to the point $(1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, ...)$.  Then if we extend the usual Euclidean metric we obtain $\text{Length}(\text{Diag}(H))=\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi^2}{6}}=\dfrac{\pi \sqrt{6}}{6}$.

229214,Is standard deviation additive?,"I am helping someone study for a statistics exam. I am quite good at most other math classes but it's been a while since I studied statistics. I am stuck on one of the exercise problems that we worked on. Exercise: This is a paraphrase of the exercise: A mason lays a row of cement blocks with a layer of motar. Each row (bricks and mortar) has a mean height of 8 inches with standard deviation 0.1 inches. What is the probability that a wall built from 4 rows of cement blocks differs from 32 inches by more than a half-inch? Assume that the height of each row is independent and distributed normally. What I can do: I know that I need to find the mean $\mu_{wall}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{wall}$ for the wall made from four rows of cement blocks. I'm given that the mean $\mu_{row}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{row}$ of one row of blocks are $\mu_{row} = 8$ and $\sigma_{row} = 0.1$. So for $n = 4$ rows, we have $\mu_{walls} = n \mu_{row} = 4 \cdot 8 = 32$. Question: How do I calculate $\sigma_{wall}$ knowing that $\sigma_{row} = 0.1$? My first guess would be to simply multiply by 4, but I'm not sure that is correct. Once I have the standard deviation, doing a Z test is easy.","['statistics', 'standard-deviation']"

229430,"How many integer solutions to a linear combination, with restrictions? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Counting bounded integer solutions to $\sum_ia_ix_i\leqq n$ (5 answers) Closed 1 year ago . I've already done a few problems such as this, other problems where I'm supposed to find the number of combinations or permutations, subject to certain restrictions. Here's been my basic strategy: Find  $A$ = the number of total solutions (combinations) were there no restrictions. Find $B$ = the number of illegal solutions (solutions that violate the restriction) Give $A-B$ as the answer. That may or may not be the best general strategy - it certainly produces some ugly messes of equations sometimes, but I think it's basically sound. The problem occurs when there are large inequalities (i.e., ""where $x_3<10$"" or something), where you have to then count every single case that satisfies that restriction, or alternatively every single case that violates it, necessitating a big stream of inelegant calculation. That alone, while annoying, is OK as long as I'm sure I'm right. The thing is, in this case I'm not sure if I can apply it here - or at least I'm not sure if I'm applying it correctly. Here's the specific problem: Find the number of non-negative solutions to the equation $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 21$$ with the restriction that $0\leq x_i\leq 10$ for each $x_i$. Now, I know that the total number of solutions to an (unrestricted) equation of this form is $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \binom{21+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{25}{4}$. But how do I count violations? I suppose the largest a given $x_i$ could be is 21. Would I then count the number of solutions where a given $x_i$ is 11, then 12, then 13... up to 21? How then would I proceed to when more than one $x$ is greater than 10? Enumerating each combination among up to 5 $x$s at 11 different values each seems to be a nightmarish prospect. Is there some simpler way of looking at the problem that I'm not seeing?

229642,Length of a Parabolic Curve,"I just wanted to know how I can find the length of a curve given by $f(x) = x^2$ from $x=0$ to $x=1$. For appproximation, the length is a bit larger than the hypotenuse of isosceles right triangle with the shorter side being 1 long.  It's definitely less than the sum of two shorter sides.  Thus, if we represent the length by $L$, the following relationship is expected:
$\sqrt 2 < L < 2$ I now regard $L$ as the accumulation of hypotenuses of infinitestimally small right triangles around $f(x)$.  Since $f'(x)=2x$, the general right triangle is something like this:
If $x$ goes very slightly down the $x$-axis ($\Delta x$), the the $y$ value goes upwards for $2x\Delta x$. Thus the hypontenuse is the square root of the following:
$(\Delta x)^2+(2x\Delta x)^2$.
The hypotenuse is:
$(\Delta x) {( 4x^2 + 1)^{1/2}}$ Since $L$ has been defined as the accumulation of these hypotenuses, it is:
$L = \int_0^1 ( 4x^2 + 1)^{1/2} dx$. I am stuck just here.  Could someone tell me if my chain of thoughts so far is right and how I can go from here?  I don't know how to calculate the integral of a function that contains another function in it. Thanks!!","['conic-sections', 'calculus']"

and the pointwise ergodic theorem:
$$\text{If  f}\in L^1(X),\text{ then we have that } \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(T^ix) \text{ converges almost everywhere.}$$
Now we can consider a more general ergodic average of the form:
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf(T^{a(i)}x)$$ 
where $\{a(i)\}$ is a sequence of natural numbers with $a(1)<a(2)<\ldots$. If the averages converges in $L^1$, then we say that $\{a(i)\}$ is good for mean convergence, and similarly for pointwise convergence. In general not every sequence is good for the two kinds of convergence. Now my question is that: does there exist a sequence which is good for mean convergence but not good for pointwise convergence?

I reasoned that, for the first row, there will be all in zeros in it; because if $a=1$ and $b=1$, the difference would be zero, which wouldn't satisfy the condition; furthermore, the b values, from then on, become increasingly larger, resulting in negative number differences.

229823,Global sections of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(D)$,"For $D$ a divisor on a smooth variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$, we define as usual the subsheaf $\mathcal{O} (D)=\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ of the sheaf of rational functions $\mathcal{K}_X$ as follows: $$\mathcal{O}_X(D)(U):=\{ f\in\mathcal{K}_X(U)\;|\; (f)\geq - D|_U \}$$ for every open $U\subseteq X$, where $(f)$ denotes the divisor attached to the rational function $f$. From now on, suppose $D\geq 0$. Then $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ is a subsheaf of $\mathcal{O}$ whose local sections are those regular functions which vanish along $D$ with multiplicity at least as indicated by the coefficients of $D$. $\mathcal{O}(D)$ has as local sections those rational functions that are regular outiside of $D$ and are allowed to have poles at most along $D$, of order at most as indicated by the coefficients of $D$. Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $X$ such that $D\cap U_\alpha$ is defined by the regular function $\eta_\alpha\in\mathcal{O}(U_{\alpha\beta})$, that is: $D|_{U_{\alpha}}=(\eta_\alpha)$. The multiplication by $\eta_\alpha$ induces local isomorphisms of sheaves: $$\eta_\alpha\cdot:\mathcal{O}|_{U_\alpha}\to\mathcal{O}(-D)|_{U_\alpha}$$ showing that $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ is locally free of rank one. So, setting $U_{\alpha\beta}$, we get transition functions $\psi_{\alpha\beta}:=\eta_\alpha\cdot\eta_\beta^{-1}\in\mathcal{O}^{\;*}(U_{\alpha\beta})$ which give a cocycle defining the (corresponding) line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-D)$. Analogously, local multiplication by the rational function $\eta_\alpha^{-1}$ gives local trivializations for $\mathcal{O}(D)$, and the cocycle given by the reciprocal $\psi_{\alpha\beta}^\vee:=\psi_{\alpha\beta}^{-1}=\eta_\alpha^{-1}\cdot\eta_\beta$ defines the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(D)$, showing that the line bundles $\mathcal{O}(D)$ and $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ are dual to each other. Note that both line bundles are trivial when restricted to $X\setminus D$ because $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$ becomes a coboundary out of $D$. Given a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ with cocycle $\{g_{\alpha\beta}\}$, a global section $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{L})$ is given by a bunch of local regular functions $s_\alpha\in\mathcal{O}(U_{\alpha\beta})$ such that $s_\beta=g_{\alpha\beta}\cdot s_\alpha$ on $U_{\alpha\beta}$. More generally, if the local functions are allowed to be rational, $s_\alpha\in\mathcal{K}_X(U_\alpha)$, then this gives a global rational section $\sigma\in \Gamma (X,\mathcal{L}\otimes\mathcal{K}_X)$. So, since clearly $\eta_\beta=\psi^\vee_{\alpha\beta}\cdot\eta_\alpha$ and $\eta_\beta^{-1}=\psi_{\alpha\beta}\cdot\eta_\alpha^{-1}$, we get a global section $$s_D:=\{\eta_\alpha\}\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(D))$$ such that $(s_D)=D$, and a rational global section $$s_D^\vee:=\{\eta_\alpha^{-1}\}\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(-D)\otimes\mathcal{K}_X).$$ Questions: Question 1. By definition of $\mathcal{O}(D)$ as a subsheaf of $\mathcal{K}_X$, we have $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(D))=\mathcal{O}(D)(X)=\{f\in\mathcal{K}_X(X)\;|\;(f)\geq -D\}$. So $s_D\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(D))$ must be a global rational function on $X$ such that its associated divisor is $\geq -D$. How can this global rational function $s_D$ be described? To be more precise, for example I would be content with a description of $s_D|_{U_\alpha}$ in terms of $\eta_\alpha, \eta_\alpha^{-1}\in\mathcal{K}_X(U_\alpha)$. Note that even if $\{\eta_\alpha\}$ is the expression of $s_D$ in ""local trivializations"", it's certainly not true that $s_D|_{U_\alpha}=\eta_\alpha$. Likewise, it's not true that $s_D|_{U_\alpha}=\eta_\alpha^{-1}$, as the identity $s_D|_{U_\alpha}=s_D|_{U_\beta}$ on $U_{\alpha\beta}$ must hold untwisted by any cocycle. By duality, the natural sheaf inclusion $j_D=s_D^\vee:\mathcal{O}_X(-D)\to\mathcal{O}_X$ gets reversed to the sheaf surjection $s_D:\mathcal{O}_X\to\mathcal{O}_X(D)$, $h\mapsto h\cdot s_D$. In general, there is an isomorphism $$\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{O}(-D),\mathcal{O})\cong\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{O}(D))=\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(D)),$$
where we go from right to left via the map on local sections $s\mapsto j_s$, $j_s(f):=\frac{s}{s_D}\cdot f$ ($f$ local section of $\mathcal{O}(D)$). Question 2. How do we go from left to right in the above isomorphism, $j\mapsto s_j$, in terms of $j,s_D, s_D^\vee, \eta_\alpha$ etc.?",['algebraic-geometry']

Please point out where the mistake is if it is incorrect. ($I^e$ denotes the extended ideal of I which also equals $S^{-1}I$, $J^c$ denotes the contraction of $J$) Proposition: Let R be a ring and let S be an multiplicative set. The ideals of $S^{-1}R$ are in one to one correspondence with the ideals I of R which do not meet S. The correspondence is $I \Leftrightarrow  S^{-1}I$. Under this corresponcence prime ideals correspond to prime ideals. Proof: Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ which do not meet $S$. For any $\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d} \in S^{-1}I$ and any $\frac{r}{s} \in  S^{-1}R $,  $\frac{a}{b}\frac{r}{s}=\frac{ar}{bs}$ is in $ S^{-1}I$ since $ar\in I$ and $cs\in S$. Futhermore,  $\frac{a}{b}+ \frac{c}{d}= \frac{da+bc}{db}$ is an element in $ S^{-1}I$ by the same argument. Converserly, let $J$ be any ideal of $S^{-1}R$, if $\frac{x}{s}\in J$ then $\frac{x}{1}\in J$, hence $x \in J^c$, (with respect to the homomorphism $\Phi: R \rightarrow S^{-1}R$, given by $\Phi(x)=\frac{x}{1}$), hence $J\subseteq J^{ce}$, further it is easy to check that $J^{ce}\subseteq J$ for any homomorphism. Hence $J=J^{ce}$. Since $J^{c}=I$ for some ideal $I$ of $R$ we have that $J=S^{-1}I$. Furthermore if $I$ is prime in$R$ it is easy to see that $S^{-1}I$ is prime in $S^{-1}R$. Converserly, if $J$ is any prime ideal $J \subset S^{-1}R$ then $J=S^{-1}I$ some ideal $I$ of $R$, if $ac\in I$ then by construction $\frac{ac}{bd} \in S^{-1}I$. Since $J$ is prime this imply that $\frac{a}{b}$ or $\frac{c}{d}$ is in $J$. This imply that $a$ or $c$ is in $I$","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Since $a^2 \in F(a)$, We have $F(a^2) \subset F(a)$, then $k\le n$ In order to prove the converse: $q(a^2)=b_0+b_1a^2+b_2(a^2)^2\ldots+b_k(a^2)^k=0$ implies $q(a)=b_0+b_1a^2+b_2a^4\ldots+b_ka^{2k}=0$ Then $p(x)|q(x)$, because $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $F$.

Each boat ride can hold at most two people, and the time it takes to get across will be the time preferred by the slower occupant. The time preferences are: $1, 2, 5$ and $10$ minutes. What is the minimal amount of time in which you can get all four people across the river, where an eastbound trip must have two occupants and a westbound trip must have one occupant? Answer: $17$ minutes. (Though many mistakenly believe it is $19$ minutes.) Question 1: If you look at all possible ways of ferrying these four people across the river, subject to the above constraints, what would the average (mean and median) times be? Question 2: What if you replace the time preferences with $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$ minutes? Question 3: What if you have time preferences $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ minutes for $n$ people, respectively? Probably the easiest way to broach Question 1 would be to write a quick program to compute the answer, and perhaps doing this for several different time preferences would give some insight into the mean and median in the general four person case. I'm not quite sure how I would start thinking about the general $n$ person case; perhaps by solving it for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$. Answers (even partial ones) to any or all of my questions would be greatly appreciated!","['statistics', 'integer-programming', 'combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'problem-solving']"
231201,On the Nakayama functor,"Let $A$ be a finite dimensional $k$-algebra with 1. Denote by $_AP$ the category of projective left $A$-modules finite dimensional. And with $_AI$ the category of injective left $A$-modules finite dimensional. Denote by $D$ the duality with respect to $k$, i.e. $D(M)=\mathrm{Hom}_k(M,k)$. Then the following functor is a functor from $_AP$ to $_AI$: $\nu=D\mathrm{Hom}_A(\;.\;,_AA)$ how can I prove it? Define also $\nu^{-1}=\mathrm{Hom}_A(D(A_A),\;.\;)$ how can I prove that this functor goes from $_AI$ into $_AP$? I want to prove that $\nu$ and $\nu^{-1}$ are quasi-inverse, how can I do it? Here they say there is an invertible natural transformation $\alpha_P:D\mathrm{Hom}(P,\;.\;)\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}(\;.\;,\nu P)$ but I don't understand why it exists, why it is invertible and why this implies $\nu$ and $\nu^{-1}$ are quasi-inverse.

231229,"""8 Dice arranged as a Cube"" Face-Sum Problem","I found this here : Sum Problem Given eight dice. Build a $2\times 2\times2$ cube, so that the sum of the points on each side is the same. $\hskip2.7in$ Here is one of  20 736 solutions with the sum 14. You find more at the German magazine ""Bild der Wissenschaft 3-1980"". Now I have three ( Question 1 moved here ) questions: Is $14$ the only possible face sum? At least, in the example given, it seems to related to the fact, that on every face two dice-pairs show up, having $n$ and $7-n$ pips . Is this necessary? Sufficient it is... How do they get $20736$? This is the dimension of the related group and factors to $2^8\times 3^4$, the number of group elements, right? i. I can get $2^3$, by the following: In the example given, you can split along the $xy$ ($yz,zx$) plane and then interchange the $2$ blocks of $4$ dice. Wlog, mirroring at $xy$ commutes with $yz$ (both just invert the $z$ resp. $x$ coordinate, right), so we get $2^3$ group lements. $$ $$
  ii. The factor $3$ looks related to rotations throught the diagonals. But without my role playing set at hand, I can't work that out. $$ $$
  iii. Would rolling the overall die around an axis also count, since back and front always shows a ""rotated"" pattern? This would give six $90^\circ$-rotations and three $180^\circ$-rotations, $9=3^2$ in total. 
  $$ \\ $$
  Where do the missing $2^5\times 3^2$ come from? Is the reference given, online available? EDIT And to not make
tehshrike sad
again ,
here's the special question for $D4$: What face sum is possible, so that the sum of the points on each side
is the same , when you pile up 4 D4's to a pyramid (plus the octahedron mentioned by Henning) and how many representations, would such a pyramid
have? Thanks","['dice', 'puzzle', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
231234,difference of square roots approximation,"In two of my physics courses in the past week, I've come across an approximation for the difference of two square roots for large radicands:
$\sqrt{x+a}-\sqrt{x+b}\approx\frac{a-b}{2\sqrt x}$ for large $x$. I have no idea where this comes from.
Wolfram|Alpha gives me the simplest answer by handing me this as the first term of the expansion around $x=\infty$, but how is that calculated? I know how normal Taylor Series expansions are formulated, but I don't get how to run this calculation. Just trying to get the approximation alone, the closest I've gotten is with the logic:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{x+b+(a-b)}-\sqrt{x+b}}{a-b}\approx\frac{d}{dx}\sqrt{x+b}
\\
\sqrt{x+a}-\sqrt{x+b}\approx\frac{a-b}{2\sqrt{x+b}}
$$
But, as you can tell, the radicand in the approximation is incorrect. (Not to mention the approximation there is that $a\approx b$, not large $x$.) I can try to say that for large $x$, $\sqrt{x+b}\approx\sqrt{x}$, but that doesn't explain why the version with just $x$ as the radicand is more accurate. (Which is true.) Plus, I also want to know how to get the higher-order terms in the expansion.","['approximation', 'calculus', 'taylor-expansion']"

Let $p$ be the quotient map from $\pi_1(M)$ to $H_1(M)$, maybe it's easy to prove that $p(C)$ is $0$ in $H_1(M).$ That will also solve my problem.
