69854,Complete implies locally compact in length metric space?,"I am confused. The way I see it, in a complete metric space, closed balls of finite diameter are compact since they are complete and totally bounded.  Consequently a complete metric space is locally compact.  Why/how/does this fail in a length metric space? The reason I am asking this is because in the Hopf-Rinow theorem for length spaces, the hypothesis are that a space needs to be complete AND locally compact (I would think complete implies locally compact by the above reasoning?)... Thanks for the help.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"
69859,Relative entropy is non-negative,"Let $p=(p_1,\dotsc,p_r), q=(q_1,\dotsc,q_r)$ be two different probability distributions. Define the relative entropy $$h(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^r p_i (\ln p_i - \ln q_i)$$ Show $h(p||q)\geq 0$. I'm given the hint that I should show $-x\ln x$ is concave and then show for any concave function $f(y)-f(x)\leq (y-x)f'(x)$ holds. I rewritten the relative entropy as $$h(p||q)=\sum_{i=1}^r p_i \ln \left(\frac{p_i}{q_i}\right)= -\sum_{i=1}^r p_i \ln \left(\frac{q_i}{p_i}\right)$$ which sort of looks like $-x\ln x$, and I did show that $-x\ln x$ is concave, but I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do, or even if this hint is helpful.",['probability']
69878,Is the determinant of a zero divisor zero?,"Suppose that $A$ is a zero divisor in the ring of $(n\times n)$-matrices over the ring $R$. Is $\det(A) =0$ if $R$ is a field? Is $\det(A) =0$ if $R$ is an integral domain? It's not necessarily true if $R$ has zero-divisors. Take for example $R=\mathbf{Z}/2^{n+1}\mathbf{Z}$ and $A=\textrm{diag}(2,2,\ldots,2)$. Then $A^{n+1}=0$ but $\det A = 2^n \neq 0$. Of course, if $R$ is a reduced ring and $A$ is nilpotent, we have that $\det(A) =0$. In fact, $A^m=0$ for some $m>0$. Thus, $\det(A)^m = \det(A^m) =0$. Thus $\det(A) $ is nilpotent in $R$. Therefore, we have that $\det(A) =0$.","['matrices', 'ring-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
69892,Baby Shower Problem. Too hard for 1st grader but got parents thinking,"So our six year old son comes home from 1st grade with the following math puzzle. Your Aunt is having a baby. You have created a party game for a baby shower.  It is called pick the gender.  You put pink and blue tiles into a bag.  You ask two guests to pick one tile each out of the bag without looking. You tell your guests that if they are the same color, player A wins and if they are two different colors, then player B wins. How many tiles of which colors did you put into the bag to make sure that both players have an equal chance of winning? Putting aside the obvious fact that this seems way too hard for a 1st grader it got us thinking...  Is there a clever way to solve this problem that doesn't involve guessing lots of ugly combinations? Let $P$ = Number of Pink Balls, $B$ = Number of Blue balls. It seems to me that the probability of Player ""B"" winning is $$\left(\frac{P}{P+B}\right)\left(\frac{B}{P+B-1}\right) + \left(\frac{B}{P+B}\right)\left(\frac{P}{P+B-1}\right)$$ In a fair game this probability is 50%. $$\frac{2PB}{(P+B)(P+B-1)} = \frac{1}{2}$$ Or $$(P+B-1)(P+B)=4PB$$ At this point we're stuck.  We notice a few random facts but can't put it all together.  For example, either $(P+B)$ or $(P+B-1)$ is divisible by four and the other one is an odd number.  We can also rearrange the terms to show that $4PB+P+B$ is a square. Can anyone out in math exchange land help us with a solution that does not involve fancy-pants math and does not involve a lot of guessing, spraying and praying?  It just seems like there ought to be an elegant solution...","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

69905,"The Cantor set is homeomorphic to infinite product of $\{0,1\}$ with itself - cylinder basis - and it topology","I know the Cantor set probably comes up in homework questions all the time but I didn't find many clues - that I understood at least. I am, for a homework problem, supposed to show that the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the infinite product (I am assuming countably infinite?) of $\{0,1\}$ with itself. So members of this two-point space(?) are things like $(0,0,0,1)$ and $(0,1,1,1,1,1,1)$ , etc. Firstly, I think that a homeomorphism (the 'topological isomorhism') is a mapping between two topologies (for the Cantor sets which topology is this? discrete?) that have continuous, bijective functions. So I am pretty lost and don't even know what more to say! :( I have seen something like this in reading some texts, something about $$f: \sum_{i=1}^{+\infty}\,\frac{a_i}{3^i} \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{+\infty}\,\frac{a_i}{2^{i+1}} ,$$ for $a_i = 0,2$ . But in some ways this seems to be a 'complement' of what I need.... Apparently I am to use ternary numbers represented using only $0$ 's and $1$ 's in; for example, $0.a_1\,a_2\,\ldots = 0.01011101$ ? Thanks much for any help starting out! Here is the verbatim homework question: The standard measure on the Cantor set is given by the Cantor $\phi$ function which is constant on missing thirds and dyadic on ternary rationals. Show the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the infinite product of $\{0,1\}$ with itself. How should we topologize this product? (Hint: this product is the same as the set of all infinite binary sequences) Fix a binary $n$ -tuple $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ (for e.g., $(0,1,1,0,0,0)$ if $n = 6$ ). Show that the Cantor measure of points ( $b_k$ ) with $b_k=a_k$ for $k \leq n$ and $b_k \in \{0,1\}$ arbitrary for $k>n$ , is exactly $1/2^n$ . These are called cylinders.

69915,Why isn't $\mathbb{R}^2$ a countable union of ranges of curves?,"I came across this question on the topology board at AoPS, where it hadn't really received an answer. It seems interesting, but I'm not sure how to solve it. Hopefully an answer will be found here. The question, from Dudley's Real Analysis and Probability , goes as A $C^1$ curve is a function $t\mapsto (f(t),g(t))$ from $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$ where the derivatives $f'(t)$ and $g'(t)$ exist and are continuous for all $t$. Show that $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a countable union of ranges of $C^1$ curves. In the google book there's also a hint to show the range of a $C^1$ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense. So out of curiosity, what's a proper way to prove the hint that the range of a $C^1$ curve on a finite interval is nowhere dense ? I've read through the first few sections of the book up to the point of the exercise, and it covers compactness, product topologies, complete and compact metric spaces and metrics on function spaces, and the theorems of Dini, Arzela-Ascoli, and the Stone Weierstrass Theorem. I'm putting a bounty to see if there's a basic solution using only this knowledge, even if it may not be the most elegant. Added : I did a little research based on the comments I received. I know that $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a complete metric space, and the Baire Category Theorem says every complete metric space is of the second category. I can decompose a curve into countably many curves defined on finite intervals, (like intervals of length $1$ maybe?). Then if $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the countable union of ranges of curves, it would also be the countable union of the ranges of these countably many smaller curves with finite domains. However, if each curve on a finite interval has nowhere dense range, then $\mathbb{R}^2$ would be the union of countable many nowhere dense sets and then be of the first category, contrary to the Baire Category Theorem. So why exactly is the range of a curve on a finite interval nowhere dense? It seems intuitively true. If I let $B=\{(f(t),g(t))\mid t\in I\}$ for some finite interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ be the range of some $C^1$ curve, then my feeling is this range looks like some ""segment"" in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is any open set, I want to find an open $V\subset U$ where $B\cap V=\emptyset$. Intuitively, it seems like I could just take some open ball of small enough radius in $U$ that doesn't meet $B$ in the plane, so the range is nowhere dense. Is there a more formal way to express this? Thanks.","['general-topology', 'analysis']"
69921,Convolution of an $L_{p}(\mathbb{T})$ function $f$ with a term of a summability kernel $\{\phi_n\}$,"... is the result in $L_{p}$?

One of the properties of a summability kernel is that there exists a $C > 0$ such that $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}|\phi_{n}(t)|dt\leq C$ for every $n\geq 1$.

70016,Voronoi region as a polyhedron,"I have been asked to prove that a Voronoi region $V=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|x-x_0\| \le \|x-x_i\|, i=1,\dots,k\}$ around $x_0$ with respect to $x_1,\dots,x_k$ is a polyhedron. My idea is to find the set of hyperplanes $h_i : a_i^Tx=b_i$ defined by the pairs $(x_0,x_i)$, such as they divide the entire space in halfspaces that fulfill $a_i^Tx \le b_i \Leftrightarrow \|x-x_0\| \le \|x-x_i\|$. Intuitively, I can see that the hyperplanes I am looking for are symmetric with respect to each pair of points, so $a_i = x_i-x_0$ and $b_i = (x_i-x_0)^T (\frac{x_i+x_0}{2})$ could be a valid solution.

70042,The Picard Group of the Affine line with double origin,"Let $X$ be the affine line with double origin over a field $k$. It is the scheme obtained gluing two copies of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ along the open sets $U_1  = U_2 =\mathbb{A}^1_k - (x)$, where, with abuse of notation, $(x)$ is the point associated to the maximal ideal of $k[x]$ generated by $x$.

A part of Exercise 7.4 of the same chapter of the same book asks to find the Picard Group of this scheme $X$, I don´t know how to find it. I made a few observations about the matter, the first one is that $Pic(\mathbb{A}^1_k)=0$, so the untriviality of $Pic(X)$ is concentrated on the double point. The second one is that, against my intuition,  $X$ is an integral scheme. Indeed it is clearly irreducible, and the existence of a nilpotent in $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ for an open set $U$ of $X$ containing at least one of the two origins implies the existence of a nilpotent in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^1_k}(V)$, where $V$ is the preimage of $U$ in the affine line to which belongs the origin contained in $U$. Using the integrality of $X$ and Proposition 6.15 of Chapter II of Hartshorne´s Algebraic Geometry we deduce that $Pic(X)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{CaCl}(X)$, i.e. the group of Cartier divisors on $X$ modulo linear equivalence.

Ultimately, I am trying to use this to prove the following for CW-spectra: Let $f:E\to F$ be a function of spectra (in the strict sense here) and $F'$ be a cofinal subspectrum of $F$.  Then there is a cofinal subspectrum $E'$ of $E$ such that $f$ maps $E'$ into $F'$. My initial intuition was to show that $f^{-1}(F')$ was the desired subspectrum, but I got stymied at the very first step because I don't know much about CW spectra.

70088,"Why do we use this definition of ""algebraic integer""?","A number is an ""algebraic integer"" if it is the root to a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. Artin says (Algebra, p. 411): The concept of algebraic integer was one of the most important discoveries of number theory. It is not easy to explain quickly why it is the right definition to use, but roughly speaking, we can think of the leading coefficient of the primitive irreducible polynomials $f(x)$ as a ""denominator."" If $\alpha$ is the root of an integer polynomial $f(x)=dx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}...$ then $d\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, because it is a root of the monic integer polynomial $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + d^{n-1}a_0$ . Thus we can ""clear the denominator"" in any algebraic number by multiplying it with a suitable integer to get an algebraic integer. When I first learned of algebraic integers, I looked online and saw some hints that maybe they were used to prove the Abel-Ruffini theorem. So I put off questioning their usage for a while; I now think I understand one proof of this theorem (the one at the end of Artin's Algebra) and it has nothing to do with algebraic integers (that I can tell).

Here $M$ is a smooth manifold, $T_mM$ is the tangent space at $m \in M$ and $F_m$ is the ideal of all germs of smooth functions from $M$ into $\mathbb R$ which vanish at $m$. 
The isomorphism is given by 
$$T_mM \to (F_m/{F_m}^2)^\ast, \quad X \mapsto \left( [f] \mapsto X(f) \right)$$
where $f \in C^\infty(U)$ represents a germ on some neighbourhood $U$ of $m$. I observed a corollary of this:
Since both vector spaces are finite dimensional, we obtain an isomorphism between the dual spaces $T_m^\ast M \simeq (F_m/{F_m}^2)^{\ast \ast} = F_m/{F_m}^2$, given by $[g] \mapsto {\mathrm dg}_m$. But this then implies the following: If $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb R^n)$ such that $f(0) = 0$ (i.e. $[f]\in F_m$ with $m=0$) and ${\mathrm df}_0 = 0$, then, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $0$ in $\mathbb R^n$ and functions $g,h \in C^\infty(U)$, such that $g(0) = 0, h(0) = 0$ and $$f(x) = g(x) h(x) \quad \forall x\in U$$ I was wondering whether one could obtain the above result directly? For the one-dimensional case this is not too difficult: Just use Taylorexpansion to get $$f(x) = f(0) + df(0)x + r(x)x^2 = r(x)x^2$$ And define $h(x) = x\cdot r(x),\; g(x) = x$. But already in dimension $2$, I don't know how one would factor something like $x^2 + y^2$. So here are my Questions: Do you see any flaws my derivation of the corollary?

Let $q(n)$ be the number of ones in the binary expression for $10^{10^{n}}$ (which is the same as for $5^{10^{n}}$ of course), for positive integer $n$. The first nine $q(n)$ values — the most I can compute — are all odd: $11, 105, 1163, 11683, 115979, 1161413, 11606847, 116093517, 1160951533$. Is this just a quirk (with even values showing up eventually), or is $q(n)$ odd for all positive integer $n$? Equivalently, letting $t(0),t(1),t(2)...$ be the Thue-Morse sequence , is $t(10^{10^{n}}) = 1$ for all positive integer $n$? It may not be surprising that about half of the binary digits of $5^{10^{n}}$ are ones, i.e., $q(n) \sim \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} \log_2(5^{10^{n}}) \approx \ 1.16096404744 \cdot 10^{n}$ (thus explaining the leading digits of sufficiently large terms), but why should all the terms be odd (if indeed they are)? Note: My motivation for posting is the expectation that a proposition like ""$q(10^{10})$ is even"" provides a problem of the kind that Solomon Feferman ( ""Are there absolutely unsolvable problems?"" , p. 16), calls ""absolutely unsolvable from the standpoint of practice"".

Let $G$ be the group of automorphisms of $K$ that fix $k$. Let $K^G$ be the fixed field of $G$ acting on $K$, and $K_0$ the maximal separable subextension of $K$.

An open immersion is a morphism $f:X\to Y$ which induces an isomorphism of $X$ with an open subscheme of $Y$. However, many other sources (including Wikipedia ) go with an open subscheme being a scheme $Z$ of the form $(U,\mathcal{O}_X|_U)$ where $U\subseteq X$ is an open subset, and then defining an open immersion to be a morphism $f:Y\to X$ that factors through an isomorphism with an open subscheme, i.e. there is an isomorphism of schemes $g:Y\,\stackrel{\sim}{\to} Z$ such that $f=i\circ g$, where $i:Z\to X$ is the inclusion map. Why make these (quite subtly) more general definitions?

But given a set, $X\subset \mathbb{R}$, $X\ne \emptyset $ that is both open and closed, how does one show that $X=\mathbb{R}$? Here is my attempt: Using the definitions I was given, $X$ open implies that for every $x\in X$ there is a $\delta \gt 0$, $(x-\delta,~ x+\delta)\subset X$.    Also, since $X$ is closed , $B=\mathbb{R}$\  $X$ is open. However, I don't know how to proceed. NB: This is not a homework problem.","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
70418,How close to zero can a Dirichlet series get?,"Suppose I have an integral Dirichlet series $f(s) = \sum c_n n^{-s}$, $c_n \in \mathbb{Z}$, with at least one non-zero term $c_N$.

I want $f(s)$ to be ""small"" (in terms of $N$) for fixed $\mathrm{Re}(s)$ and a range of $\mathrm{Im}(s)$.  How small can I get it over any given range?

70434,Example of non-Noetherian non-UFD Krull domain?,"After a confusing session of hopping through Wikipedia articles, I
started trying to summarize for myself some of the inclusions and
relations among the many types of integral domains. Right now I'm just
gathering and organizing facts from various sources, rather than going
through all the proofs in detail. (To be honest, my knowledge of
commutative algebra is embarrassingly poor, and I haven't even
understood all of the definitions yet. But one has to start
somewhere...) Anyway, I have a few questions about things that I haven't been able
to figure out on my own, and I'll start with this one: Are there Krull domains that are neither Noetherian nor UFD? (I would guess yes, but I haven't seen any examples. The standard example
of a non-Noetherian Krull domain seems to be $\mathbf{Z}[X_1,X_2,\dots]$ with countably many variables,
but that's a UFD unless I'm mistaken.
And $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is a non-UFD which is a Dedekind domain, hence a Krull domain and Noetherian.)","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

However, I don't think this is correct (I don't know complex variables that well, so I'm hesitant to say the book is wrong). First, $f(z)$ is analytic at $z=1$, so shouldn't we get a unique power series expansion about $1$, and hence no negative coefficients? Second, I'm not sure their expansion of $\displaystyle 1/(1-\frac{3}{(z-1)})$ is valid near $1$, since $\displaystyle |\frac{3}{(z-1)}|$ is not less than $1$ for $z$ close to $1$. Can anyone confirm my reasoning, or explain why it's wrong?

he proved the following theorem: If $M^n$ is complete Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature, and $V^r$, $W^s$ are two compact totally geodesic submanifolds. If $r+s\ge n$ then $V$ and $W$ have a non-empty intersection. The proof is by contradiction. If there is no intersection, then chose $\gamma$ connecting $V$ to $W$ and realized the distance between $V$ and $W$. Due to the dimension reason, he find a parallel vector fileld $X$ along $\gamma$, then apply the second variational formula. For the boundary term $g(\nabla_X X, \dot{\gamma})$. He claimed this is zero due to the totally geodesic property. My question is: In order to take covariant derivative $\nabla_v Y$, the vector field $Y$ has to be defined at least along one curve $\sigma$ with $\dot{\sigma}=v$, right? But for $\nabla_X X$ in the proof, the vector filed $X$ is only defined along $\gamma$ not along the tangent direction $X$. (My guess is it does not depend on the extension of $X$, but I can't see why, or it's too trivial so Frankel didn't write it down?) edit:
I found that probably, we can just extend $X$ at $\gamma(0)$ and $\gamma(\ell)$ as the tengent vector of geodesic along direction $X$, and extend $X$ at $\gamma(t)$ arbitrary. So this will give the desired boundary condition. Is my claim correct?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

70587,*writing* proofs involving commutative diagrams,"This question is a little fuzzy so might be closed, but I'll give it a shot. I'm sorry this question has quite a long introduction, I don't see how to formulate it more concisely. In modern algebraic geometry (for example), many objects are defined by universal properties of commutative diagrams etc. Now sometimes we want to prove statements about them (see below for a specific example). If we were working in, say, sets, then there are often proofs that one might call ""element-wise"". That is to say we prove say that two objects are isomorphic by writing down a morphism (explicitely!), a claimed inverse, and check on all points that the compositions indeed are the identity. This does not work in (for example) the category of schemes, where a morphism ""is"" more than what it ""does to points"", and where moreover we may not have very explicit descriptions of various objects (e.g. fibred products). I thus find myself resorting to work with commutative diagrams and universal properties. This works, in the following sense: for any particular statement, I could convince a friend of it's correctness. This would go by drawing some diagram, saying a few words, extending the diagram and so on (this is the step where I get my morphisms, say). Finally I retrace various various of the maps I started with to show certain properties about composites and can then conclude that the morphism I have produced are actually inverses. There typically are three things to be observed about this: (1) Everything I did was ""obvious"" - in the sense that by writing down what I want to prove, I am immediately guided towards what I have to show in succession to make sense of it, and then verifying every step is usually trivial. (2) Even though I can (with some thought) talk through a proof, I do not feel like I actually understand it very well. (3) I have no idea how I would possibly write down such a proof. (Short of spending pages on trivialities, most of which consists of very similar-looking diagrams). My question is, then, how to improve my situation. Note that if (2) were to improve then I would feel less of a need of being able to do (3) [although it would of course be nice]. A specific Example ""Show that relative frobenius commutes with base change"". Recall that for $X \in Sch/\mathbb{F}_p$, the morphism $\mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_X, x \mapsto x^p$ induces a morphism $F_X: X \to X$ known as absolute frobenius. If we now fix $S \in Sch/\mathbb{F}_p$, we can define, for $X \in Sch/S$, $X^{(p)} = X \times_{S} S'$, where $S'$ is the scheme $S$ with structure morphism $F_S$. It is then easy to see that $X \to S$ and $F_X: X \to X$ canonically induce a morphism $F_{X/S}: X \to X^{(p)}$ known as relative frobenius. Now given a base change $T \to S$, we have to show that $(X^{(p)})_T$ is canonically isomorphic to $(X_T)^{(p)}$, and that the composite $X_T \to (X_T)^{(p)} \to (X^{(p)})_T$ (first morphism being $F_{X_T/T}$) is just $F_{X/S} \times id_S.$ As I said above, I know (some way) to show this, it involves a mess of commutative diagrams, and writing this out would take a remarkable amount of space for a sequence of trivialities.","['category-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

$$V_n(RB^n)=\int_{RB^n}1dx=\int_0^R\int_{rS^{n-1}}1d\textbf{S}dr=\int_0^R\int_{S^{n-1}}r^{n-1}d\textbf{S}dr=$$$$=\int_0^Rr^{n-1}\int_{S^{n-1}}1d\textbf{S}dr=\int_0^Rr^{n-1}S_{n-1}dr=\frac{R^n}{n}S_{n-1}$$

70689,Total variation distance and mutually singular probability measure,"Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be two probability measures on $(\Omega,F)$. Let $||\mu-\nu||$ denote the total variation distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$. Show that if $||\mu-\nu||=1$ then the support of $\mu$ and $\nu$ are disjoint. I'm not familiar yet with measure theory. I tried to bound 
$$||\mu-\nu||=\mu(A)-\nu(A),A=\{E \in F : \mu(E) \ge \nu(E)\}$$ with something that is less than $1$, but I didn't succeed. I think, it doesn't matter, but if does, we may assume $\Omega$ is finite.",['measure-theory']
70710,Integral related to Arcsinh(x),"It is not difficult to verify that
$$ \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx} \left[ \log\Big(x+\sqrt{x^2+1}\Big) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} $$
for $x\geq 0$, say. How would one calculate the indefinite integral 
$$ \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \ \!\mathrm dx$$
without knowing this? I have tried many of the usual tricks, without success. The title of the question is chosen because Mathematica outputs $\text{Arcsinh}(x)+C$ as the answer.","['calculus', 'integration']"
70717,Why does the natural ring homomorphism induce a surjective group homomorphism of units?,"I'm trying an old problem here: http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m111s09/public_html/homework-posted/hw1.pdf Suppose $n\mid m$, and I have a natural ring homomorphism $\varphi\colon \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $\varphi(j)=j\mod{n}$. I can verify that this is a ring homomorphism, but why does it induce a surjective group homomorphism on the unit groups $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times\to(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$? My question in particular is why is it surjective? I take $k\in(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$. Then there exist integers $s,t$ such that $sn+tk=1$. Since $n\mid m$, I can also write $m=na$. So multiplying through I get $sm+tka=a$. I'm lost here. How can I find a unit in $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ which maps to $k$ to show surjectivity?","['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"
70720,Confidence Interval within min and max values,"I have set of numbers and know it's size, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. When I calculate regular confidence interval for mean I get something like this (-20;50). But the source value can only be positive, so it would look bad on a graph. I'd like to find confidence interval within given minimum and maximum values. It's just max values have random peaks and I want to smooth it with CI. Is there some way to do it?",['statistics']
70721,Solving a problem involving continuity of a piecewise function,"I'm trying to solve the following problem: Determine which $n\in\mathbb{N}$ make the following function
  $f:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous at the origin: $   f(x,y,z)=\left\{
      \begin{array}{cr}
       
 \frac{(\cos^2\left(|x|+|y|\right)-1)\sin(y^2+z^2)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{n/2}}
 & \text{if } (x,y,z) \neq 0\\
        0 & \text{if } (x,y,z) = 0\\
      \end{array} 	\right. $ It's obvious that $f$ is continuous at the origin if $n\leq 2$, since: $\left|\frac{(\cos^2\left(|x|+|y|\right)-1)\sin(y^2+z^2)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{n/2}}\right|\leq\frac{|\cos^2\left(|x|+|y|\right)-1|\,|y^2+z^2|}{|x^2+y^2+z^2|}\leq\frac{|\cos^2\left(|x|+|y|\right)-1|\,|y^2+z^2|}{|y^2+z^2|}=|\cos^2\left(|x|+|y|\right)-1|\rightarrow 0$ I'm almost sure the function isn't continuous if $n> 2$ but I can't seem to find a way to prove it.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'limits']"
70728,Partial derivative in gradient descent for two variables,"I've started taking an online machine learning class , and the first learning algorithm that we are going to be using is a form of linear regression using gradient descent. I don't have much of a background in high level math, but here is what I understand so far. Given $m$ number of items in our learning set, with $x$ and $y$ values, we must find the best fit line $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0+\theta_1x$ . The cost function for any guess of $\theta_0,\theta_1$ can be computed as: $$J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$ where $x^{(i)}$ and $y^{(i)}$ are the $x$ and $y$ values for the $i^{th}$ component in the learning set. If we substitute for $h_\theta(x)$ , $$J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m(\theta_0 + \theta_1x^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$$ Then, the goal of gradient descent can be expressed as $$\min_{\theta_0, \theta_1}\;J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$$ Finally, each step in the gradient descent can be described as: $$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j} J(\theta_0,\theta_1)$$ for $j = 0$ and $j = 1$ with $\alpha$ being a constant representing the rate of step. I have no idea how to do the partial derivative. I have never taken calculus, but conceptually I understand what a derivative represents. The instructor gives us the partial derivatives for both $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ and says not to worry if we don't know how it was derived. (I suppose, technically, it is a computer class, not a mathematics class) However, I would very much like to understand this if possible. Could someone show how the partial derivative could be taken, or link to some resource that I could use to learn more? I apologize if I haven't used the correct terminology in my question; I'm very new to this subject.","['multivariable-calculus', 'gradient-descent', 'partial-derivative', 'numerical-optimization']"
