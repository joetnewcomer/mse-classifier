1720559,Automatic differentiation-Reverse mode,"I am trying to understand very basics material and a bit confused about steps. If we have function $z=f(x_1,x_1)=x_1x_2+sinx_1=w_1w_2+sinw_1=w_1+w_4=w_5$ we need  fix the dependent variable to be differentiated and computes the derivative with respect to each sub-expression recursively, according to chain rule we have - $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dw_1}\frac{dw_1}{dx}=(\frac{dy}{dw_2}\frac{dw_2}{dw_1})\frac{dw_1}{dx}=(((\frac{dy}{dw_4}\frac{dw_4}{dw_3})\frac{dw_3}{dw_2})\frac{dw_2}{dw_1})\frac{dw_1}{dx}=((((\frac{dy}{dw_5}\frac{dw_5}{dw_4})\frac{dw_4}{dw_3})\frac{dw_3}{dw_2})\frac{dw_2}{dw_1})\frac{dw_1}{dx}$ $w_1=x_1, w_2=x_2$ $\bar w=\frac{dy}{dw}$ Then I have the next calculation- 1) $\bar f =\bar w_5 = 1 $ seed 2) $\bar w_4=$$\bar w_5$$\frac{dw_5}{dw_4}=$$\bar w_5 *1$ 2) $\bar w_3=$$\bar w_5$$\frac{dw_5}{dw_3}=$$\bar w_5 *1$ 3) $\bar w_2=$$\bar w_3$$\frac{dw_3}{dw_2}=$$\bar w_3 w_1$ I don't really see how we obtained these steps from the chain.

1720606,Extending parallel 1 forms to harmonic forms on a compact set,"Based on this question from Peterson's Riemannian Geometry: Let $(M,g)$ be an n-dimensional connected Riemannian manifold that is isometric
  to Euclidean space outside some compact subset $K \subset M$, i.e., $M − K$ is
  isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n − C$ for some compact set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. If $\text{Ricg} \geq 0$, show that $M = \mathbb{R}^n$. There are then two hints, but they basically run into the same problem in opposite directions: the first hint leads you to conclude that there are parallel 1 forms defined on $K$ (after showing $K$ is flat, and thus the whole space is flat), but I cannot go from here to conclude that there are globally defined parallel 1 forms. The other hint tells you to extend the $n$ parallel 1 forms on $M-K$ to harmonic forms on $M$, and use Bochner's technique to conclude that these extensions are parallel. Again, I see the logic, but I am having trouble seeing how to extend the 1-forms on $M-K$ over $K$. Any ideas?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

1720778,What does the derivative of a function at a point describe? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What does it mean to differentiate in calculus? (4 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I understand that the derivative of a function $f$ at a point $x=x_{0}$ is defined as the limit $$f'(x_{0})=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_{0}+\Delta x)-f(x_{0})}{\Delta x}$$ where $\Delta x$ is a small change in the argument $x$ as we ""move"" from $x=x_{0}$ to a neighbouring point $x=x_{0}+\Delta x$. 
What confuses me is how to interpret its meaning correctly, that is, what does the derivative $f'(x_{0})$ actually describe? On Wikipedia it says that "" the derivative of a function quantifies the rate at which the value of the function changes as we change the input "" (or words to that effect). However, the function has a particular constant value, $f(x_{0})$ at a given point $x=x_{0}$ so how can one meaningfully discuss the rate at which the value of the function is changing at that point? Would it be correct to interpret the derivative of a function at a point as describing how ""quickly"" it's value changes as we move from that point to (infinitesimally close) neighbouring points? (As such in the example above, in moving from the point $x_{0}$ to $x_{0}+\Delta x$ the value of the function $f$ changes by an amount $f'(x_{0})\Delta x$ for infinitesimally small change $\Delta x$). Is it then simply that the value of the derivative at that point equals the slope of the tangent line to the the function (curve) at that point? (In general then, the derivative of a function is itself a function whose value at each point equals the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point).","['derivatives', 'intuition', 'calculus']"

1720818,A mirror focusing beams at one point,"How can I find a shape of a mirror which focuses all parallel beams in one point? I tried to do it in this way: The mirror must be symmetric hence I assumed it has a center in the point $(0,0)$. The point which focuses all the beams is $ (0,a), \, a>0$. Now $$L_{1}:\frac{-1}{f^{'}(t)}x  +C $$ is a line perpendicular to tangent to a mirror (a mirror given by a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ )at point $(t,f(t))$ $$L_2:t$$ is a beam and $$L_3:\frac{f(t)-a}{t}x +a $$ is a line going through both $(0,a)$ and $(t,f(t))$. Now the requirement that  angle between $L_1 $ and $L_2 $ and angle between $L_1 $ and $L_3 $ are equal should give a proper differential  equation. Unfortunately, it is not. Am I doing any mistakes?

1720834,Prove that $a-b=b-a\Rightarrow a=b$ without using properties of multiplication.,"Yesterday my Honors Calculus professor introduced four basic postulates regarding (real) numbers and the operation $+$ : (P1) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c), \forall a,b,c.$ (P2) $\exists 0:a+0=0+a=a, \forall a.$ (P3) $\forall a,\exists (-a): a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0.$ (P4) $a+b=b+a, \forall a,b.$ And of course, we can write $a + (-b) = a-b$ . Then he proposed a challenge, which was to prove that $$a-b=b-a\iff a=b$$ using only these four basic properties.

1720902,"The equivalence of two definitions of closed subscheme, Vakil's Ex 8.1.K","Generally in literature, the definition of a closed embedding in the category of scheme is a morphism $\pi:X \rightarrow Y$ between two schemes such that $\pi$ induces a homeomorphism of the underlying topological space of $X$ onto a closed subset of the topological space of $Y$, and the induced map $\pi^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_*\mathcal{O}_X$ of sheaves on $Y$ is surjective. However Vakil uses a different definition, $\pi:X \rightarrow Y$ is a closed embedding if $\pi$ is an affine morphism and for every affine open subset $\text{Spec}~B \subset Y$ with $\pi^{-1}(\text{Spec}~B)=\text{Spec}~A$, the induced ring homomorphism is surjective, i.e. $B \rightarrow A$ is surjective.

1721052,Moment problem for order statistics,"Problem : Let $X_{1},\cdots,X_{n}$ be samples from $X$. If $E\left|X\right|^{a}<\infty$
for some $a>0,$ and $n,k,r$ satisfies $r\leq a\cdot\min\left(k,n-k+1\right),$
then $E\left|X_{\left(k\right)}\right|^{r}<\infty$. Attempted Solution Since $E\left|X\right|^{a}<\infty,$$E\left[X\right]^{r}<\infty$
for any $r\in\left[0,a\right].$ Note that 
\begin{align*}
+\infty>E\left|X\right|^{a}=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|t\right|^{r}dF\geq\int_{x}^{+\infty}\left|t\right|^{r}dF=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|t\right|^{r}1_{[x,+\infty)}\left(t\right)dF.
\end{align*}
Since $\left|t\right|^{r}1_{[x,+\infty)}\left(t\right)\rightarrow0$,
it follows from DCT that $\int_{x}^{+\infty}\left|t\right|^{r}dF\rightarrow0.$
On the other hand, we have 
\begin{align*}
\int_{x}^{\infty}\left|t\right|^{r}dF & \geq\left|x\right|^{r}P\left(X>x\right)\geq0.
\end{align*}
Take the limit and we get 
\begin{align*}
0=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\int_{x}^{+\infty}\left|t\right|^{r}dF\geq\lim_{x}\left|x\right|^{r}P\left(X>x\right)\geq0,
\end{align*}
which implies 
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x}\left|x\right|^{r}P\left(X>x\right)=\lim_{x}\left|x\right|^{r}\left(1-F\left(x\right)\right)=0,\ \left|x\right|^{r}\left(1-F\left(x\right)\right)<\infty.
\end{align*}
Next by integration by parts we have ($G$ is the survival function)
\begin{align*}
\infty> & \int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a}dF=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a}dP\left(X\leq x\right)\\
= & \int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a}d\left[1-P\left(X>x\right)\right]\\
= & -\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a}dP\left(X>x\right)\\
= & -\left[x^{a}P\left(X>x\right)\right]_{0}^{\infty}+a\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a-1}P\left(X>x\right)dx\\
= & a\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a-1}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]dx.
\end{align*}
Hence, we have $a\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{a-1}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]dx<\infty.$
Next, let $G_{k}$ be the distribution function of $X_{\left(k\right)}.$
It is easy to see that 
\begin{align*}
G_{k}\left(x\right)= & P\left(X_{\left(k\right)}<x\right)=P\left(\left(X_{1},\cdots,X_{n}\right)\mbox{ has at least }k\mbox{ elements }\leq x\right)\\
= & \sum_{i=k}^{n}\binom{n}{i}\left[F\left(x\right)\right]^{i}\left(1-F\left(x\right)\right)^{n-i}.
\end{align*}
Note that we can write 
\begin{align*}
E\left|X_{\left(k\right)}\right|^{r}= & \int_{-\infty}^{0}\left|x\right|^{r}dG_{k}+\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{r}dG_{k}.
\end{align*}
We talk about the second integral first. Note using similar method
as before, we get 
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{r}dG_{k}= & -\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{r}dP\left(X_{\left(k\right)}>x\right)\\
= & -\left[x^{r}P\left(X_{\left(k\right)}>x\right)\right]_{0}^{+\infty}+r\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{r-1}P\left(X_{\left(k\right)}>x\right)dx.
\end{align*}
Since 
\begin{align*}
x^{r}P\left(X_{\left(k\right)}>x\right)= & x^{r}P\left(\left(X_{1},\cdots,X_{k}\right)\mbox{ has at most }\left(k-1\right)\ \leq x\right)\\
= & x^{r}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}{i}\left[F\left(x\right)\right]^{i}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]^{n-i}\right)\\
= & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\binom{n}{i}x^{r}\left[F\left(x\right)\right]^{i}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]^{n-i}\\
\leq & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\binom{n}{i}x^{r}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]\rightarrow0,
\end{align*}
where the last convergence results follows from previous argument,
then it follows that 
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{r}dG_{k}= & r\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{r-1}P\left(X_{\left(k\right)}>x\right)dx\\
= & r\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{r-1}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}{i}\left[F\left(x\right)^{i}\right]\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]^{n-i}\right)dx\\
= & r\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\binom{n}{i}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\left\{ x^{a}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]\right\} ^{\frac{r-a}{a}}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]^{n-i-\frac{r}{a}}\left[F\left(x\right)\right]^{i}x^{a-1}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]dx.\tag{1}
\end{align*}
Note that (1)Since $x^{a}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]<\infty$ and $\lim_{x}x^{a}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]\rightarrow0,$
$\left\{ x^{a}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]\right\} ^{\frac{r-a}{a}}\leq M.$ (2) If $n-i-\frac{r}{a}\geq0,$ then $\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]^{n-i-\frac{r}{a}}$
is bounded by 1. Since $i\in\{0,\cdots,k-1\},$ we have $r\leq a\left(n-i\right),\forall i\iff r\leq a\left(n-k+1\right).$ So if $r\leq a\left(n-k+1\right)$, then 
\begin{align*}
\left(1\right)\leq & M\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a-1}\left[1-F\left(x\right)\right]dx<\infty,

1721097,Motivation/Intuition behind Lorentz spaces,"My current understanding is that the Lorentz spaces $L^{p,q}$ arise naturally as interpolation spaces between $L^1$ and $L^\infty$, but then people often describe them heuristically by saying something along the lines of ""Lorentz spaces provide a finer control than $L^p$ spaces"", and this is where I'm lost - what does that really mean? It certainly seems like a reasonable claim, if only because you now have an extra parameter to tweak, and since $L^{p,p}=L^p$, well the Lorentz spaces are simply a larger class of spaces amongst which your classical $L^p$ spaces live, so sure, they are ""better"" because there's more of them, so I can give more nuanced descriptions, but I don't really understand where the nuance lies, I don't understand what extra control the Lorentz spaces provide you that the usual $L^p$ spaces do not. I feel like my question is very vague overall, so feel free to ask for clarifications. As an example of the type of answer that I think there might be to what I am asking is the following cryptic (to me anyway) comment on the wikipedia page for ""Lorentz spaces"": ""The Lorentz norms provide tighter control over both qualities than the $L^{p}$ norms, by exponentially rescaling the measure in both the range (p) and the domain (q)"". I have no idea what that means, if anyone does, please let me know, but it seems like, after clarification, it would provide a nice intuitive explanation for precisely how Lorentz spaces provide finer control than $L^p$ spaces do.","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

   \right.$$ Because each $f_n$ is continuous over our given interval but $f$ is not, then $f_n$ cannot converge uniformly to $f$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$. However, let $|x|\geq 1$. Considering the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of $e^{nx^2}=1+nx^2+...$, we are able to discern that $e^{nx^2}>nx^2$. Thus, given $\varepsilon>0$, we find that by choosing $n>N=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $$\left|\frac{1}{e^{nx^2}}-0\right|=\left|\frac{1}{e^{nx^2}}\right|<\left|\frac{1}{nx^2}\right|\leq \left|\frac{1}{n}\right|<\varepsilon.$$ In other words, we find that $f_n\to f$ uniformly on the intervals $(\infty,-1]$ and $[1,\infty)$. Question: Are my intervals for uniform convergence correct? It seems to me like given an $\varepsilon>0$ and $\alpha>0$, I can find a single $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ and $x\in [\alpha,\infty)$, $$|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon.$$ However, I can see how changing $\alpha$ (i.e. an $x$) we would be changing our $N$ and thus defy uniform convergence in a way (because it is dependent on $x$). Can someone please help me clear this up? Thanks in advance.","['real-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'analysis']"

Show that if $Y$ is path connected, the set $[I,Y]$ has a single element.  Here $I=[0,1]$. My approach to the problem is as follows.  Let $f,g \in [I,Y]$ and $f,g:I \to Y$ be continuous functions.  First I define a function $F(x,t)=f(x(1-t))$.  Hence $F(x,0)=f(x)$ and $F(x,1)=f(0)$.  This show that $F$ is a homotopy from  $f$ to $e_{f(0)}$.  Likewise, define $G(x,t)=g(xt).$  Here $G(x,1)=g(x)$ and $G(x,0)=g(0)$.  This shows that $G$ is a homotopy from $g$ to the constant function $e_{g(0)}$.  Since $Y$ is path connected we can find a path that forces a homotopy between $e_{g(0)}$ and $e_{f(0)}$.  Hence $f\cong e_{f(0)}\cong e_{g(0)} \cong g$.

Players always know how many coins there are in the pots. Who wins and what is the perfect strategy? I managed to solve it, but the solution is very complicated and is based on fact which I just randomly guessed, but cannot deduct without the full solution. So I am looking for a nice approach to this problem. The easy part is determining that player two wins: if there is a smallest winning initial donation by the first player, then the first move of player one cannot be taking just from the second pot, and this fact leads to infinite count of winning positions for player two for bounded number in the first pot, which is impossible (since there cannot be two winning positions for player two with the same amount of coins in the first pot).","['puzzle', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-game-theory', 'game-theory']"

Again we have: $$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 $$ where $ A,B,C,D,E,F \in \mathbb Z$ Individ suggested that instead of following a general algorithm proposed by Dario Alpern ( https://www.alpertron.com.ar/METHODS.HTM ) a more elegant and computationally faster may be a method of transforming QDE into some form of Pell's equation. The questions are: Can any QDE be transformed into some form of Pell's equation? If yes, please provide guidelines.

Does such transformations into Pell's yield any substantial advantage in terms of solving QDE over Alpern's guidelines?

1722002,Find distance to a set (subspace) without computing closest point,"General setup: we have a finite-dimensional normed linear space $(V, \| \cdot \|)$, a subspace $U \subset V$, and a fixed vector $v_0 \in V$. We want to find the distance between $v_0$ and $U$. (No cheating: $\| \cdot \|$ is not induced by an inner product!) We don't care about finding the closest $u^* \in U$ to $v$ ; this would of course solve the problem, but let's assume it's computationally infeasible. All we care about is finding the number $d_0 = \min_{u \in U} \|u - v_0\|$ (or a reasonable substitute). It's entirely possible that finding $d_0$ is equivalent to finding $u^*$, and this would be an acceptable answer to my question, but maybe there's some clever way to find $d_0$ without $u^*$. Examples: (This is really a non-example.) If $V = \mathbb R^n$ (or some other Hilbert space), then we may use orthogonal projections, and everything's bunnies and butterflies. Great. If $V = \mathbb F_2^n$ with the Hamming norm $\|v\| = \#\{i \in [n] : v_i = 1\}$, then $U$ is a binary linear code. Finding $u^*$ is the hard-decision decoding problem, which is in general NP-complete. (There may be some special cases of $U$ that make things easier, but we cannot assume we're in such a case.) Then, I suppose what we're after is some way of ""fingerprinting"" elements of $V$ to see if they're near $U$. Fingerprinting $v_0$ will lead to something like an answer. 2 is the case that I really have in mind, but I'd be happy to hear anything relevant: a particular $(V, \| \cdot \|)$ where this does work, for example, or a relaxation of some conditions (maybe $V$ is just a metric space and $U$ is just a subset) which admits an affirmative example.","['coding-theory', 'optimization', 'normed-spaces', 'metric-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

1722296,Lines in upper half-space,"I'm teaching a tour-of-classical-geometry class this semester, and we are soon to introduce hyperbolic geometry. I am very inexpert in this subject, and I have a question about a compatibility of a pair of basic viewpoints on the hyperbolic plane. $\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb R}\newcommand{\C}{\mathbb C}\newcommand{\RP}{\R\mathrm P}\newcommand\CP{\C \mathrm P}\DeclareMathOperator{\Gal}{Gal}$First, the hyperbolic plane can be viewed as a certain surface with a certain metric.  It can be compactified by adding an $\RP^1$ at its ""boundary"".  If you like, you can think of the hyperbolic plane as being modeled on the open complex upper half-plane, with $\RP^1$ added in at the real axis and at complex infinity.  This compactification has the pleasant property that isometries of the hyperbolic plane agree with isometries of $\RP^1$: an isometry of the hyperbolic plane extends to give an isometry of the boundary, and an isometry of the boundary fills in to give an isometry of the hyperbolic plane. In light of the ""complex upper half-plane"" model, there is a second natural way one might arrive at this object: $\RP^1$ has a natural embedding into $\CP^1$ as the fixed points of the action of $\Gal(\C/R)$.  The other points in $\CP^1$ appear in Galois-conjugate pairs which, without any loss of generality, can be identified with the half of the pair that happens to lie in the upper half-plane.  This makes it clear that automorphisms of $\RP^1$ extend to automorphisms of $\CP^1$: these are exactly the automorphisms of $\CP^1$ (i.e., the Möbius transformations, or linear fractional transformations) which fix $\RP^1$ (i.e., which have real coefficients). What's not obvious from the second presentation is how to start doing plane geometry with $(\CP^1 \setminus \RP^1) \; //\; \Gal(\C/\R)$.  The original presentation of the hyperbolic plane comes equipped with a definition of a line: these are the geodesics for the metric, and one computes that these are given by circles in the complex half-plane with center lying on the real axis.  Explicitly, these are solution sets of equations like $$z \bar z - b (z + \bar z) + c = 0$$ where $b$ and $c$ are real and the solution set is nonempty.  This expression is evidently Galois-invariant, but I can't guess where it would come from in the Galois version of the story. Question: Is there a purely Galois perspective on why this equation deserves to be called anything like a ""line"" in $\CP^1\;//\;\Gal(\C/\R)$? It seems likely to me that this question, if answerable, is a little tricky. For instance, I imagine that it rests on $[\C:\R] = 2$ — one of life's happy accidents, but something obscuring in a question like this. P.S.: I'm happy to be told I'm looking for something that isn't there. Higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces probably don't arise like this, and maybe the idea of doing plane geometry in this object is totally a consequence of the accidental isomorphism with the hyperbolic plane. That's OK too!","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'galois-theory', 'geometry']"

Let X be the random variable describing the number of couples that end up being seated across from each other. What is the variance of X? I uncovered this problem in my book and have found the following: The seating arrangements are not independent. the $E(X)$ is 1 if you use indicator variables, ie. if $I_k$ is the indicator variable that is 1 if a couple k is seated across from one another and 0 otherwise. so $X=\sum_{k=1}^n I_k$ and the $E(X)$ is worked out to be 1. I believe I am correct so far, however, I am stuck here. 
Since the each $E_k$ is not entirely independent, I tried using 
$Var(X)= E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = E(X^2) - 1$ So I need $E(X^2)$, which is a double sum. I do not know if this is solvable or if there is some term missing. Any direction would be appreciated. Edit: Okay, so I also know that $ p(I_k)=1/n $ and by the same rational $p(I_k*I_j)= 1/(n^2-n)$. So I am assuming I am missing some term because each k is not independent.

I was thinking, since $F$ has no nontrivial odd extensions, then every extension is divisible by $2$, and it's known from field theory that in this case every finite extension has degree a power of $2$. In particular, every nontrivial finite extension of $E$ must be have degree a power of $2$. If any one of these extensions is Galois, then choosing a fixed field of a subgroup of a suitable index would give a field extension of $E$ of degree $2$, a contradiction. Thus $E$ would have no nontrivial finite extensions, implying it's algebraically closed. Is there a way to make this work that I'm missing? I'm blank on how to see that $F$ is perfect? If $F$ is imperfect of characteristic $p$, then $F\neq F^p$. If $a\in F\setminus F^p$, then I recall that $X^{p^e}-a$ is irreducible, so adjoining any root would give an extension of $F$ of degree $p^e$. Since $F$ only has extensions of degree $F$, necessarily $\operatorname{char}(F)=0,2$. In the former case, $F$ is perfect, but if $\operatorname{char}(F)=2$? Furthermore, if $\operatorname{char}(F)=0$, let $K/E$ be a finite extension. Since we're working over characteristic $0$, we can enlarge this to a Galois extension, denoted $\tilde{K}$, to get a tower $\tilde{K}/E/F$. So $\tilde{K}/E$ is Galois as well, but then as noted above, if this is not proper, $E$ will have a quadratic extension. Thus $\tilde{K}=E$, so $K=E$. Thus $E$ is algebraically closed. So I feel the only remaining difficulty is when $\operatorname{char}(F)=2$. Edit: Maybe it's a sledgehammer, but I think showing $E$ is algebraically closed without assuming characteristic $0$ is sufficient. For if $[E:F]=1$, then $E=F$ is perfect as all algebraically closed fields are. If not, since then $1<[E:F]<\infty$, Artin-Shreier implies $E=F(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\operatorname{char}(F)=0$, so $F$ is again perfect.","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'field-theory']"

1722808,"Using the IVP definition of $\cos$ and $\sin$, how can we show that $\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x) = 1$ without any ""magic""?","One way to define the exponential, hyperbolic and circular functions is to assert that they're the unique solutions to certain IVP systems: The exponential function: $$\exp'(x) = \exp(x), \qquad \exp(0) = 1$$ Hyperbolic functions: $$\cosh'(x) = \sinh(x)$$ $$\sinh'(x) = \cosh(x)$$ $$\cosh(0) = 1$$ $$\sinh(0) = 0$$ The circular functions: $$\cos'(x) = -\sin(x)$$ $$\sin'(x) = \cos(x)$$ $$\cos(0) = 1$$ $$\sin(0) = 0$$ Question. Using the IVP definition of $\cos$ and $\sin$, how can we show that $\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x) = 1$? I'm looking for a satisfying proof that I can present to young people, so: no complex numbers, and no power series, and, more generally no ""magic""! In fact, the closer the proof is to being ""just plain algebra"", the better. Motivation. There's a geometric way of defining the circular functions: first, position yourself at $(1,0)$ on the unit circle. Then start walking anticlockwise at unit speed. It follows that if the time elapsed is $t$, your $x$-coordinate will be $\cos t$ and your $y$-coordinate will be $\sin t$. The above information can be organized into four statements: We walk on the unit circle centered at the origin. We position ourselves at $(1,0)$ to begin with. We walk at unit speed. We walk anticlockwise. These can be formalized as follows: $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1$ $\cos(0) = 1, \sin(0) = 0$ $(\cos't)^2+(\sin't)^2 = 1$ $\sin'(0) > 0$ Now conditions 2 and 4 follow easily from the IVP definition. Furthermore, if we can show 1, then 3 follows easily.

1723003,Counting the number of rank $r$ binary $n \times k$ matrices that has unique columns,"I'm trying to figure out how many ways there are to construct a $k \times n$ binary matrix such that it has rank $r$ and no column is repeating. I've tried a bunch of different approaches. The attempt that I assign the highest confidence is the following: We want to enumerate all possible $B_r = [\textbf{b}_1,\dots \textbf{b}_n]$ such that $\textbf{b}_i \in \mathbb{F}_2^k$, $\textbf{b}_i \neq \textbf{b}_j$ and Rank$(B_r) = r$. The number of ways to pick a basis of dimension $r$ from a subspace of dimension $k$ is given by the Gaussian binomial ${k \brack r}$. Since we have $n$ column slots and this basis will occupy $r$ of these slots, we can insert the basis in $\binom{n}{r}$ different ways. To fill the remaining $n-r$ columns, we must not choose a vector outside of the span of this basis, which means we must fill the remaining $n-r$ rows from a set of $2^r-r$ candidates. There are $2^r-r$ ways of choosing $\textbf{b}_{r+1}$ and $2^r-r-i$ ways of choosing $\textbf{b}_{r+i}$, where $i= 1,\dots,n-r$, so the number of possible rank $r$ matrices of dimension $k \times n$ with no repeating columns is given by $$|\{M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n \times k}: \text{Rank}(M)=r, \textbf{m}_i \neq \textbf{m}_j\}| = \binom{n}{r}{k \brack r}\prod_{i=1}^{n-r} (2^r - r-i).$$ EDIT: After comparing joriki's expression with simulations in Matlab I just didn't get the right results. Let me try to reformulate my thought process as clearly as possible. Begin by considering the number of possible $r$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^k$, given by ${k \brack r}$. Enumerate all ways of building a $k \times n$ matrix only using elements from such a subspace, which is $\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$. The problem is that all of these ${k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$ matrices will not have rank $r$ (but none will have rank \emph{more} than $r$). To begin with, we must subtract all $k \times n$ rank $r-1$ submatrices. How many of these are there? Well the columns are eminating from a $r$-dimensional binary space. So we count the number of subspaces of dimension $r-1$ to an $r$-dimensional space and multiply with the number of ways of choosing $n$ vectors from this space. We get ${r \brack r-1}\frac{2^{r-1}!}{(2^{r-1}-n)!}$. But once again we have the problem that not all these have rank $r-1$. So from this we must subtract ${r-1 \brack r-2}\frac{2^{r-2}!}{(2^{r-2}-n)!}$ and so forth. \begin{align}
|\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = &{k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^r \Big({r \brack r-i}\frac{2^{r-i}!}{(2^{r-i}-n)!} \\
&- \sum_{j=1}^{r-i}\Big({r-i \brack r-i-j}\frac{2^{r-i-j}!}{(2^{r-i-j}-n)!} - \sum_{\ell=1}^{r-i-j} \Big(\dots  
\end{align}
So how do we define this recursively? Define
\begin{align}
a_0 &:= {k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} \\
a_{p,q} &:= {p \brack q}\frac{2^q!}{(2^q-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^p a_{q,q-i}.
\end{align}
Then we should have
\begin{align}
|\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = a_0 - \sum_{i=1}^r a_{r,r-i}.
\end{align} Tested this in Matlab and it does not work - it doesn't subtract enough matrices. The effect is greatest when $n,r < k$ and all parameters are not tiny. It is kind of weird how $k$ never enters into the enumeration of rank $r-i$ matrices of size $k\times n$. I guess it COULD make sense that the enumeration is conditionally independent on $k$ given that we know this new $r-i$ dimesional subspace is embedded in an $r<k$ dimensional space. But clearly undercounting is done somewhere in the recursion and this seems like the likeliest candidate. I guess the question is: Is counting the ways we can build a $k \times n$ matrix by only using elements from an $r-i$ dimensional subspace really the same as counting $r-i$ dimensional subspaces of $r<k$-dimensional space times the number of ways we can choose $n$ vectors out of this space? It does not seem right. EDIT 2: Back to where I started, essentially can't see the problem of the original attempt $$|\mathcal{N}_{r,k}| = {k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!} - \sum_{i=1}^r |\mathcal{N}_{r-i,k}|.$$ Just count the number of $k \times n$ matrices with rank $r$ or less, then subtract all $k \times n$ matrices with rank less than $r$. This expression should essentially hold by definition. Really frustrating. EDIT 3: So the fault is ${k \brack r}\frac{2^r!}{(2^r-n)!}$ as a formula for counting all $k \times n$ matrices with rank at most $r$. It is overcounting by quite a bit. This is because the same matrix could be formed by choosing $n$ different components from two different subspaces. Consider subspaces $A = \{x_1,\dots, x_n, a_{n+1},\dots, a_{2^r}\}$ and $B = \{x_1,\dots,x_n, b_{n+1},\dots,b_{2^r}\}$. They're two distinct subspaces but we are counting the matrix formed from taking the first $n$ vectors from $A$ and the matrix formed from taking the first $n$ vectors from $B$ as two different matrices. Clearly they're not. Which makes one wonder if this can be solved with some kind of additional inclusion-exclusion trick, or if it's just one of those really tricky problems.","['inclusion-exclusion', 'combinatorics', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"
