2901325,Norm of a linear operator from $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3$,"Find $\|T\|_{\mathcal{L}}$ where $T\in\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R}^3)$ is defined by $$T(\mathbf{x})=(x,2x, 3x)\ \ \ \forall \mathbf{x}=(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$$ My approach $T$ is a linear operator (easy to prove); $\|\mathbf{x}\|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\ \ \ \forall \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^2$ $\|T(\mathbf{x})\|=\sqrt{x^2+4x^2+9x^2}=\sqrt{14}|x|$ so $\frac{\|T(\mathbb{x})\|}{\|\mathbf{x}\|}=\frac{\sqrt{14}|x|}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\le\frac{\sqrt{14}|x|}{|x|}=\sqrt{14}\ \ \ \forall\mathbf{x}\ne \mathbf{0}$ This means that $\|T\|_{\mathcal{L}}\le\sqrt{14}$. For $\mathbf{x}=(1,0)$ we have that $\|T(\mathbf{x})\|=\sqrt{14}$ so $\|T\|_{\mathcal{L}}=\sqrt{14}$. Second approach Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a unitary vector of $\mathbb{R}^2$, such that
$$\|\mathbb{x}\|=1\implies x^2+y^2=1 \ \ \ \to |x|=\sqrt{1-y^2}\ \ \ \forall y\in [-1,1]$$ so $$\|T(\mathbf{x})\|=\sqrt{14}|x|=\sqrt{14}\sqrt{1-y^2}\le\sqrt{14}\ \ \ \forall y\in [-1,1]$$ In particular $\|T(\mathbf{x})\|=\sqrt{14}$ for $(x,y)=(1,0)$, hence $\|T\|_{\mathcal{L}}=\sqrt{14}$.

2901451,Definition of ODE and flow on manifold.,"I have the following confusion in my recent lectures in Riemannian geometry. The idea is to define the notion of Lie derivative using the exponential map. In my lecture notes is the following: Let $ M $ be a smooth manifold. $ X $ be a vector field on $M$. Let $ F: V \rightarrow U \subset M $ be a local coordinate chart of $ M $ where $ V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n} $ is an open set in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $. If $ u = (u_1,...u_n) \in V $ is the coordinate in $V$. Then we consider the following system of ordinary differential equations: $$\begin{cases}
du/dt = X(u)\\
\\
u(0)= F^{-1}(p)
\end{cases}$$
for $ p \in M $. The first question I have is what does the above equality means. More precisely, we think of tangent vectors in $ T_{p}M $ as elements that are behaves like directional derivatives. Hence $ X $ should admits the expression $ X = \sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{j} \frac{\partial_{}}{\partial{u_j}} $ which takes values in $ M $ and where $ ( \frac{\partial}{\partial{u_j}} )_{p}$ is defined such that 
$$ (\frac{\partial }{\partial{u_j}} )_p f = \partial_{e_j}( f \circ F \circ F^{-1} \circ p ) $$
where $f$ is a smooth function on $M$ defined locally near $p$. In the lecture, however, it was just said that we should interpret the above equality as
$$ du_j/dt = X_j .$$
My first question is then, is this a consequence of the above discussion? Or simply by definition? After all, $X$ is not meant to take values in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We then defined the solution of the above 
$$e^{tX}(p) = u(t,p)$$
corresponding to the initial position $F^{-1}(p)$. And somehow this becomes an element of $ M $. But following the above discussion $u(t,p)$ is clearly in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $! The only reasonable explanation I can think of is that $e^{tX}(p) = F( u(t,p) ) $ would be correct notation. This is my second question. Could somebody explain what the actual definition is? Thanks!","['lie-derivative', 'riemannian-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2901533,"To be homeomorphic or isometric means ""to be the same"" ? What about $L^3$ and $L^{3/2}$ or $(\mathbb R^2,\|.\|_1)$ and $(\mathbb R^2,\|\mathbb \|_2)$?","I'm confuse with something : my topological teacher told us that *To be homeomorphic means to be the same"". Does it also hold for normed vector spaces or to be ""the same"" they must be isometric ? I really have problem with this because normed space are topological spaces. Let few example to illustrate : 1) Let $(\mathbb R^2, \|\cdot \|_1)$ and $(\mathbb R^2, \|\cdot \|_2)$  where $\|(x,y)\|_1=|x|+|y|$ and $\|(x,y)\|_2=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. I know that both norms are equivalent, and thus $\mathcal T_{1}=\mathcal T_2$ where $\mathcal T_i$ is the topology of $\mathbb R^2$ induced by $\|\cdot \|_i$. Therefore, $X_1:=(\mathbb R^2,\mathcal T_1)$ and $X_2:=(\mathbb R^2,\mathcal T_2)$ are homeomorphic, and since $\mathcal T_1=\mathcal T_2$, they are in fact the same, so $X_1=X_2$ makes sense. But they are not isometric, so there are not the same ? 2) Now, Riesz-representation says for example that $(L^1)'$ and $L^\infty $ (where $(L^1)'$ means the topological dual of $L^1$) are isometric, and thus $(L^1)'=L^\infty $ in the sense that there are the same. 3) Now, I know that for example $L^3$ and $(L^{3})''$ are isometric (and thus are the same). I know that $L^3\hookrightarrow (L^3)'$ and thus $L^3$ and $(L^3)'=L^{3/2}$ are homeomorphic. Now it doesn't make any sense to say that $L^3$ and $L^{3/2}$ are the same since for example there are function that are in $L^3$ that are not in $L^{3/2}$ and reciprocally. 4) The thing is I'm not sure that the bijection between $L^3$ and $(L^3)'$ is an homeomorphism. If it's not, suppose that $(X,\|\cdot \|_X)$ and $(Y,\|\cdot \|_Y)$ are homeomorphic but not isometric. Can we say that there are the same or not ? If not, what is the subtelty in the example 1) ? Could someone explain me the difference subtlety in those 4 examples ?","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

2901576,How to properly deduce the Holomorphic Implicit Function Theorem from the Smooth Real Implicit Function Theorem?,"I have seen at several places, incl. some notes and books, the following inference of the Holomorphic Implicit Function Theorem from the Smooth Real Function Theorem, but I believe this proof to be incorrect or rather incomplete in that it seems to be missing a non-obvious key step. I would like to know how to complete the proof if possible at all. Please note that there are of course other proofs of the Holomorphic Implicit Function Theorem that work, but my question is not about them, but about fixing this one. So, let me illustrate what I have in mind in the case of 2 complex variables: Hol. Impl. Funct. Thm. in 2 var.-s : Let $U,V \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be open subsets and let $f:U \times V \to \mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function. Let $(z_0,w_0) \in U \times V$ be a point such that $f(z_0,w_0) = 0$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z_0,w_0) \neq 0$.
Then $z_0$ has an open neighbourhood $\widetilde{U} \subseteq U$ such that there exists a holomorphic function $g: \widetilde{U} \to \mathbb{C}$ with the property $g(z_0)=w_0$ and $\forall z\in \widetilde{U}: f(z,g(z)) = 0$. Proof: By the Real Smooth Implicit Function Theorem there exist an open neighbourhood $\widetilde{U}\ni z_0$, $\widetilde{U}\subseteq U$, and a smooth $g:\widetilde{U} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $\forall z \in \widetilde{U}: f(z,g(z))=0$ as smooth functions.
Thus we only need to show that $g$ is holomorphic in $\widetilde{U}$.
Since $f$ is holomorphic in both variables, one computes
$$
0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}} f(z,g(z)) =
\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z,g(z)) \frac{\partial g}{\partial\bar{z}},
$$
hence at $(z_0,w_0)$
$$
0 = \frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z_0,w_0) \frac{\partial g}{\partial\bar{z}}(z_0),
$$
from where it follows that $\frac{\partial g}{\partial\bar{z}}(z_0)=0$ since $\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z_0,w_0) \neq 0$ by hypothesis. $\Box$ The problem: this only shows that $g$ is complex-differentiable at the point $z_0\in\widetilde{U}$ rather than in all of $\widetilde{U}$, and none of the proofs I have seen actually justifies why the reasoning should extend to the whole neighbourhood. Attempt to rectify the problem : by continuity of $\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}$ there are neighbourhoods $U'\ni z_0$ and $V'\ni w_0$ such that $\forall (z,w)\in U'\times V': \frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z,w)\neq 0$.
So we can take $\widetilde{U}\cap U'$ instead, but this does not suffice because we only know that $g(\widetilde{U}\cap U')\cap V' \ni w_0$, so we don't actually have that
$$
\forall z\in \widetilde{U}\cap U': \frac{\partial f}{\partial w}(z,g(z))\neq 0.
$$ Is there a way to salvage this proof without resorting to a completely different proof strategy?

Yes, I know the intuition behind the algebra,that we  subtract $\bar x\text{ and } \bar y$ so that the mean is zero and the the sign of products gives us the correlation and we divide by $\sigma_x\cdot\sigma_y$ to remove the effects of scaling of the distributions.

2901651,Closed form solution for this integral?,"I'm hitting a road block in finding an expression (closed form preferably) for the following integral: \begin{equation}

Things I have considered or tried: look up in tables (Gradshsteyn and Ryzhik): there are very few explicit results for integrals involving $\exp(-a x^3)$ (or for the other factors after transforming via $y=x^3$ ). Also, tabulated results involving $\exp(-a x^p)$ for more general $p$ do not include the other factors $x^b (1-x/u)^c$ . One exception is (3.478.3): \begin{equation}
\int^{u}_0 x^b (u-x)^c \exp(-a x^3) dx,

A binomial expansion of $[1-(x/u)]^n$ for integer $n$ would produce a solution in series form. However, in my case, the exponents $b$ and $c$ are strictly half-integer. For the same reason, integration by parts does not lead to a simpler integral without the factor $[1-(x/u)]^c$ ; Wolfram Math online did not produce a result; the integral is an intermediate step in a longer analysis, so numerical solution (with given values for the parameter) is not practical.

An orientation of $R$ (my terminology) is a submonoid $N\subseteq R_0$ which intersects each associate equivalence class at exactly one point. That is, if $x\sim y$ (i.e. $x=uy$ for some $u\in R^*$) where $x,y\in N$ then $x=y$, and if $x\in R_0$ then there exists $y\in N$ such that $x\sim y$. For example, $\Bbb Z^+$ is an orientation of $\Bbb Z$, and if $k$ is a field then the set of monic polynomials is an orientation of $k[X]$. Does every integral domain have an orientation? For PIDs, the answer is yes: For each prime ideal $P$, pick a prime generator $P=(p)$, and let $N$ be the set of products of these generators. Since $R$ is a UFD, no two distinct products can be associate, and moreover if $x\in R_0$ then $x$ is a product of primes, and for each prime $q_i$, if $p_i$ is the chosen generator of $(q_i)$ then $p_i\sim q_i$ so $x$ is associate to $\sum_ip_i$. There are non-orientable commutative rings that are not integral domains. For example, in $\Bbb Z/6\Bbb Z$, there are only two units, so every square must be in $N$ (since either $x\in N$ or $-x\in N$ implies $x^2\in N$), so the only possible structure is $\{1,3,4\}$; but $3\cdot 4=0$ so this is not a submonoid.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'integral-domain']"

2902064,Unit disk as cartesian product,"Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of real numbers. For each of the following subsets of $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$, determine whether it is equal to the cartesian product of two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. (a) $\{(x,y):y>x\}$ and (b) $\{(x,y): x^2+y^2<1\}$ Proof: Consider an example (b). Let $C:=\{(x,y): x^2+y^2<1\}=A\times B$ where $A,B\subset \mathbb{R}$. Since $\{0\}\times (-1,1)\subset C=A\times B$ then $(-1,1)\subset B$ and applying the same for $(-1,1)\times \{0\}$ we get that $(-1,1)\subset A$. Hence $(-1,1)\times (-1,1)\subset A\times B=C$. Taking the point $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\in (-1,1)\times(-1,1)\subset A\times B=C.$ Then by the definition of $C$ we get that $(\sqrt{3}/2)^2+(\sqrt{3}/2)^2=3/2<1$. This contradiction proves that unit circle cannot be equal to the cartesian product of some $A$ and $B$, where $A,B\subset \mathbb{R}$. Is this proof correct?

The statement ""$(a,+\infty)\cap Y$ and $(-\infty,a)\cap Y$ form a subbasis for the subspace topology of $Y$"" means that every set that is open in the subspace topology of $Y$ is a union of finite intersection of elements of the form $(a,+\infty)\cap Y$ and $(-\infty,a)\cap Y$. Any open set in the subspace topology of $Y$ is of the form $Y\cap U$ with $U$ open in the order topology of $X$. ($U$ is open in $X$ if it is a union of sets of the form $[a_0,b),[b_0,a),(a,b)$.) So the above statement says that any set $Y\cap U$ with $U$ open in $X$ is a union of a finite intersection of sets of the form $(a,+\infty)\cap Y$ and $(-\infty,a)\cap Y$. I don't see why this follows directly from what had been said before in the first paragraph of the text. And the implication that follows is unclear for now. For the second highlighted part. We need to show that given a set open in the order topology of $Y$, it is open in the subspace topology of $Y$. The former means that the set is a union of open rays of $Y$. Each open ray of $Y$ is the intersection of $Y$ with an open ray of $X$, so each open ray of $Y$ is open in the subspace topology of $Y$.

In particular, any set of the form $\{x\}\times (-\infty,+\infty)$ is open there, since $$\{x\}\times (-\infty,+\infty)=\bigcup_{r\in \mathbb R_{<a}} \{x\}\times (r,b)\bigcup_{s\in \mathbb R_{> b}} \{x\}\times (a,s)$$ Second, the open sets in $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R$ in the dictionary order topology is one of the two forms: Consider an open set in the dictionary order topology. If it has the first form, then it is open in $\mathbb R_d\times \mathbb R$ because it is of the form $$\bigcup_{r\in \mathbb R_{> a}}\{a\}\times (a,r)\bigcup_{t\in (a,b)_{\mathbb R}}\{t\}\times (-\infty,+\infty)\bigcup_{s\in\mathbb R_{< d}} \{b\}\times (s,d).$$ A set of the second form is clearly open in the product topology. Thus the dictionary order topology is contained in the product topology. Is the above correct? The converse is somewhat unclear. If we have a set open in the product topology, it does not necessarily have one of the two forms above. It may have the form $\{x\}\times (-\infty,y_0)$ or $\bigcup_{x\in [r,s]_{\mathbb R}}\{x\}\times (-\infty,y_0)=[r,s]\times (-\infty,y_0)$. What to do in such cases? I've just realized that the sets in the picture form a basis , they are not all open sets. Then I it suffices to show that any basis element of the product topology, namely $\{x\}\times (a,b)$, is a subset of a basis element of the dictionary order topology, and conversely, right? The former is obvious. The latter is obvious for basis elements of the second type. But it's still unclear why a basis element of the first type is contained in a set of the form $\{x\}\times (a,b)$.",['general-topology']

2903044,Every graph $G$ with $d(G) \ge 4k$ has a $(k + 1)$-connected subgraph $H$ such that $\epsilon (H) > \epsilon(G) − k$.,"I have a confusion with Theorem 1.4.3 (Mader 1972) of the Diestel book on Graph Theory which states that Let $0 \ne k \in \mathbb N$. Every graph $G$ with $d(G) \ge 4k$ has a $(k + 1)$-connected subgraph $H$ such that $\epsilon (H) > \epsilon(G) − k$. and it's proof is as follows Put $\gamma := \epsilon(G)$ ($\ge2k$), and consider the subgraphs $G' \subseteq G$ such that
  $$|G'| \ge 2k \text{ and } \|G'\| > \gamma (|G'| − k ).      \tag{$*$}$$
  Such graphs $G'$ exist since G is one; let $H$ be one of smallest order. No graph $G'$ as in $(∗)$ can have order exactly $2k$, since this would
  imply that $\|G'\| > \gamma k \ge 2k^2 > \binom{|G'|}{2}$. The minimality of $H$ therefore implies that $\delta(H) > \gamma$: otherwise we could delete a vertex of degree at most $\gamma$ and obtain a graph $G' \subseteq H$ still satisfying $(∗)$. In particular, we have $|H| \ge \gamma$. Dividing the inequality of $\|H\| > \gamma |H| − \gamma k$ from $(∗)$ by $|H|$ therefore yields $\epsilon(H) > \gamma − k$, as desired. It remains to show that $H$ is $(k + 1)$-connected. If not, then $H$
  has a proper separation $\{U_1,U_2\}$ of order at most $k$; put $H[U_i] =: H_i$. Since any vertex $v \in U_1 \setminus U_2$ has all its $d(v) \ge \delta(H) > \gamma$ neighbours from $H$ in $H_1$ , we have $|H_1| \ge \gamma \ge 2k$. Similarly, $|H_2| \ge 2k$. As by the minimality of $H$ neither $H_1$ nor $H_2$ satisfies $(∗)$, we further have $$\|H_i\| \le \gamma (|H_i| − k)$$ for $i=1,2$. But then 
  \begin{align}
\|H|| &\le \|H_1\| + \|H_2\| \\
      &\le \gamma (|H_1| + |H_2|- 2k) \\
      &\le \gamma (|H| - k) \qquad \text{(as $|H_1 \cap H_2| \le k$),} \\
\end{align}
  which contradicts $(∗)$ for $H$. In this proof why they select Graph $G'$ with condition $(*)$? why we are not able to find a graph $G'$ as in $(*)$ can have order exactly $2k$? How they would imply the condition $\|G'\| > \gamma k \ge 2k^2 > \binom{|G'|}{2}$ ?","['graph-theory', 'proof-explanation', 'algebraic-graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I would like to learn the theory because as the modeling gets more complicated, more theory comes into play and I would like to understand more than the general explanation. However, my foundation of probability is not well-rounded. I know of mean, standard deviation, variance, hypothesis testing, linear model assumptions, but there are not that complex. Specifically, I would like to explore more of the different types of distributions (gamma, poisson, etc), and explore topics related to modeling (logistic, support vectors, random forest, etc), but also topics in Data Mining and Machine Learning.

Similarly,  let $p_1+1=p_2-1=a\times b$ be such that $|b-a|$ is minimised. Now assume the twin prime conjecture, and let $$\mathcal P_n=\frac{\#\text{twin primes} \le n:\min\{|b_1-a_1|,|b-a|,|b_2-a_2|\}\neq|b-a|}{\#\text{twin primes} \le n}$$ What is the value of $\mathcal P_\infty$ ? Note that by convention the pair $(2,3)$ are not twin primes. For twin primes less than $100$ , we have that $p_1=5,17$ .

Hence there exists a real number $M>0$ such that $|f(z+th)|\leq M$ for all $t\in[0,1]$. This means that we can use the continuity under the (Lebesgue's) integral sign theorem.

The de Rham Cohomology ""measures the failure of closed forms to be exact"". Trying to convince myself that Cauchy's theorem is somehow geometrically intuitive led me to the one-line proof where point 1 above is combined with Stoke's theorem, which in turn has led me to wonder if there was something going on at the level of differential forms over $\mathbb{C}$. I apologise if the question is unclear; as I said, I have the feeling like there's a revelation about holomorphic functions dancing just out of my reach.","['complex-analysis', 'de-rham-cohomology']"

Then we have $Im(\tau)=\{1,-1\}$, and by the first isomorphism theorem, we get that the index of $ker(\tau)$ is $2$. Is it correct?

""Given two dice were rolled, and one of them rolled a 3. What would you bet the other dice rolled?"" The phrasing is just to enhance that there might be some number that has an higher probability of showing on the other dice. One of us said that since 7 is the most likely number to be rolled by two dices, then 4 should be the answer. The other said that once the 3 was set on one dice, we should not be looking at anything other than the other cube - so any number would be an equal guess.","['dice', 'probability']"

I don't quite see how to proceed. All previous applications of splitting principle first took the flat pullback along $p: \mathbb{P}(E) \to X$. So I first tried considering the following diagram: $\hspace{6cm}$ Then using flat pullback I get $$p^{*} (c_r (E) \cap \alpha) = c_r(p^*E) \cap (p^* \alpha) = \beta$$ where $\beta$ now is an element of $A_{k-1} (p^{-1}(Z))$, since $s$ induces $p^*s$ with zero set $p^{-1}Z$.

I encountered this problem while trying to prove the latter using the Riemann definition of integration, $$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\,\Delta x\right)$$ So if $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$ and that $x_i \in [a,b]$,
$$f(x_i) < g(x_i)$$
$$f(x_i)\,\Delta x < g(x_i)\,\Delta x$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\,\Delta x< \sum_{i=1}^n g(x_i)\,\Delta x$$ This is where my confusion is.

By applying $\lim_{x\to\infty}$ to both Riemann sums, this implies that $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \leq \int_a^b g(x)\,dx$. This seems to suggest that the integrals could be equal. But I can't seem to wrap my head, intuitively, why this is the case. Is there an example of two functions with strict inequalities but equal integrals.

2903431,Why defining regular conditional probability?,"Given probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, I can understand the definition of conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[X\mid \mathcal{G}]$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a sub $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{F}$. If we define $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G}) := \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_A\mid\mathcal{G}]$, we get $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})$ as a conditional probability. So, why do we need to define regular conditional probability? Can I explain the reason like this? The conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})$ satisfies: $\mathbb{P}(\Omega\mid\mathcal{G})=1$ a.s.; $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})\ge 0$ a.s.; $\mathbb{P}(\sum_n A_n\mid\mathcal{G}) = \sum_n \mathbb{P}(A_n\mid\mathcal{G})$ a.s. for non-intersecting sets $\{A_n: n\ge 1\}$. Taking $\mathbb{P}(\omega, A)$ as a representative of $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})$ (since it is an equivalence class of random variable), we hope that $\mathbb{P}(\omega, \cdot):\mathcal{F}\to\mathbb{R}$ is almost surly a probability measure. It easily satisfies $\mathbb{P}(\omega, \Omega)=1$ and $\mathbb{P}(\omega, A)\ge 0$ a.s., but has difficulty on countable-additivity. To satisfy $\mathbb{P}(\omega, \sum_n A_n) = \sum_n\mathbb{P}(\omega, A_n)$ a.s., we must exclude a series of null sets $\{N_n: n\ge 1\}$; and for another series of $\{B_n: n\ge 1\}$, to satisfy $\mathbb{P}(\omega, \sum_n B_n) = \sum_n\mathbb{P}(\omega,B_n)$ a.s., we must exclude another series of null sets $\{M_n: n\ge 1\}$... Then totally we need to exclude 
a big set 
$$
\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty N_n\right) \cup \left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty M_n\right) \cup \cdots
$$
which may no longer be a null set. To deal with this difficult, we introduce the concept of regular conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(\cdot, \cdot): \Omega\times\mathcal{G}\to[0,1]$, such that $\mathbb{P}(\omega,\cdot)$ is a probability measure on $\mathcal{G}$ for every $\omega\in\Omega$. $\mathbb{P}(\cdot,A)$ is a measurable function on $(\Omega,\mathcal{G})$ for every $A\in\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathbb{P}(\omega,A)=\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})$ a.s. Since we can tolerance difference between $\mathbb{P}(\omega,A)$ and $\mathbb{P}(A\mid\mathcal{G})$ on null sets, we can just directly remove the ""almost surly"" suffix of $\mathbb{P}(\omega,\Omega)=1$ and $\mathbb{P}(\omega,A)\ge 0$. Please point out my mistakes.","['conditional-expectation', 'conditional-probability', 'probability-theory']"
2903446,Only three types of limit of distributions truncated to a finite interval in the upper tail?,"Suppose random variable $X$ has a continuous probability distribution with an unbounded upper tail; that is, the CDF of $X$ (call it $F$) is absolutely continuous and $F(x)<1$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}.$ Now consider the conditional CDF of ${X-a\over w}$ given that $a\le X\le a+w$, for $w>0$:$$G(y,a,w):=\mathbb{P}\left({X-a\over w}\le y\ {\LARGE \mid}\ a\le X\le a+w\right) ={F(a+w\,y)-F(a)\over F(a+w)-F(a)}\,1_{0\le y\le 1}+1_{y>1}.$$ WolframCloud computations lead to the following ... Observation : Apparently, for all well-known parametric families of such distributions (e.g., Normal, Lognormal, Student's t, Cauchy, Maxwell, Gamma, Gumbel, Weibull, etc.), there are only three types of limit of the CDF of ${X-a\over w}\mid a\le X\le a+w$ as $a\to\infty$ :
  $$\lim_{a\to\infty}G(y,a,w)=\lim_{a\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\left({X-a\over w}\le y\ {\LARGE \mid}\ a\le X\le a+w\right) \\[3ex]
= \begin{cases} 
1_{y>0} & \text{(Type 1: Degenerate at $0$)}\\[2ex]
y\,1_{0\le y\le 1}+1_{y>1} & \text{(Type 2: Uniform on $[0,1]$)}\\[2ex]
{1- e^{-y\,w/\beta}\over 1-e^{-w/\beta}}1_{0\le y\le 1}+1_{y>1} & \text{(Type 3: Exponential$(\beta/w)$ on $[0,1]$)}
\end{cases}$$ 
  where $\beta$ is a parameter depending on the $X$ distribution. NB : The Type 3 limit depends on both $w$ and the $X$ distribution, but the Type 1 and Type 2 limits are free of w and free of all parameters of the $X$ distribution , which seems quite remarkable. NB : Letting $Y_a={X-a\over w}$, for all three types (and any other type, if there are any) we have $$\begin{align}y\le 0&\implies \{Y_a\le y\}\cap\{0\le Y_a\le 1\}=\{Y_a=0\}\implies \lim_{a\to\infty}G(y,a,w)=0\\
y\ge 1&\implies \{Y_a\le y\}\cap\{0\le Y_a\le 1\}=\{0\le Y_a\le 1\}\implies \lim_{a\to\infty}G(y,a,w)=1\end{align}$$
since $\mathbb{P}(Y_a=0)=0$ due to the distribution of $X$ (hence $Y_a$) being continuous;  thus, the types of limit differ only for $y$ in the open interval $(0,1)$ . Here are pictures of these three types of limit: Questions : How generally does this observation hold, and how can it be proved analytically? (Is this something well-known?) What $X$ distributions (if any) do in fact yield a limit not among these three types? In the Degenerate case, the limit is not right-continuous at $y=0$, so it fails to be a CDF. Nevertheless, as $a\to\infty$ the probability mass clearly concentrates in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of $y=0$ (as indicated by the plots below); so, is there a valid interpretation of this as a limiting distribution? (My original motivating question concerned only the asymptotic variance for just Normal vs. Lognormal. These variances of course follow from the above limiting distributions.) Examples Degenerate Limit Here are the CDFs (left) and corresponding PDFs (right) for Normal($0,1$), showing the CDFs, PDFs labeled as $G(y,a,w),\ g(y,a,w)$ for various $a$ with $w=1$: Computations show that the limit of the distribution is degenerate at $0$ for apparently any Normal, Gumbel, Rayleigh or Maxwell distribution, or any Weibull distribution with shape parameter $> 1.$ Uniform Limit Here are the CDFs (left) and corresponding PDFs (right) for LogNormal(0,1), showing the CDFs, PDFs labeled as $G(y,a,w),\ g(y,a,w)$ for various $a$ with $w=1$: Computations show that the limit distribution is Uniform on $[0,1]$ for apparently any LogNormal, Student-t, Cauchy, Levi, Pareto, or Inverse Gamma distribution, or any Weibull distribution with shape parameter $< 1.$ Exponential Limit Here are the CDFs (left) and corresponding PDFs (right) for Gamma($\alpha=2,\beta=3$), showing the CDFs, PDFs labeled as $G(y,a,w),\ g(y,a,w)$ for various $a$ with $w=1$: Computations show that the limit distribution is Exponential on $[0,1]$ for apparently any Gamma distribution (which includes the Weibull distribution with shape parameter $= 1$), or any Logistic, Laplace, or Extreme Value distribution.

Here, $\eta$ is the Dirichtlet eta function.  In addition, $[t^k]\big(g(t)\big)$ denotes the coefficient of $t^k$ in the Laurent expansion of $g(t)$ about $t=0$ .

Similarly, $$\begin{align}\int_0^\infty\,\frac{\exp(t\,u)-1}{\exp(u)-1}\,\text{d}u&=\ln(2)+2\,\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\,\frac{\sin\big((1-t)\,y)\,\sin(t\,y)}{\sin(y)}\,\text{d}y\\

To address a trivial proof, one can define $\log(z)$ on $U \equiv \mathbb{C} 
\setminus 
\{x : x \geq 0 
\}$ by $\{ \log(re^{i \theta}) = (\log(r)) + i \theta$  when $0 < \theta < 2 \pi, r > 0 \}$. Before proceeding any further, take note that $$u(r, \theta)=\log(r) \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ v(r, \theta) =\theta.$$ Now it's easy to note that
$$
 \big(  \partial_{r}u \big) =\frac{1}{r}= \frac{1}{r} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{r} \cdot \left(  \partial_{\theta} v\right)\ \ \ \ \ \text{and } \ \ \ \  \big(  \partial_{r}u \big) = 0 = \frac{-1}{r}\cdot 0 = \frac{-1}{r} \cdot \big( \partial_{\theta} u \big)

\bigg| \oint_{\eta_{R}^{2}}\frac{\log(z)}{z^{2} + 6z + 8}dz\bigg|& = \bigg| \int_{-R}^{+Ri} \frac{\log(Re^{it})}{(Re^{it})^{2} + 6(Re^{it}) + 8} iRe^{i \theta} d \theta\bigg|\\&=  \int_{-R}^{+Ri} \bigg|\frac{\log(Re^{it})}{(Re^{it})^{2} + 6(Re^{it}) + 8} \bigg| \big| iRe^{i \theta} d \theta \big|\\&= \int_{-R}^{+Ri} \frac{\bigg|\log(Re^{it}) \bigg|}{\bigg|(Re^{it})^{2} + 6(Re^{it}) + 8 \bigg|}  \bigg|iRe^{i \theta} \bigg| \bigg|d \theta  \bigg| \\& = \int_{\theta_{0}}^{2 \pi - \theta_{0}} \frac{\bigg|\log(Re^{it}) \bigg|}{\bigg|(Re^{it})^{2} + 6(Re^{it}) + 8 \bigg|}  \bigg|iRe^{i \theta} \bigg| \bigg|d \theta  \bigg|
\end{align*} Now we can establish a precise estimate over $\eta_{R}^{2}$, $$\bigg| \oint_{\eta_{R}^{2}} \frac{\log(z)}{z^{2} + 6z + 8}dz\bigg| \leq  \frac{\ln(R) + \pi }{R^{2} - 13} \pi r \, \, \text{as} \, \, \, R \rightarrow \infty $$ There by proving $(*)$. A similar process can be done for $\eta_{R}^{4}$, hence: \begin{align*}
\bigg| \oint_{\eta_{R}^{4}} \frac{\log(e^{it}/\sqrt{R})}{(e^{it}/ \sqrt{R})^{2} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8}  dz\bigg|& =  \oint_{\eta_{R}^{4}} \bigg| \frac{\log(e^{it}/\sqrt{R})}{(e^{it}/ \sqrt{R})^{2} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8}  iRe^{i \theta} d \theta\bigg|\\&= \oint_{\eta_{R}^{4}}  \frac{\bigg|\log(e^{it}/\sqrt{R}) \bigg|}{\bigg|(e^{it}/ \sqrt{R})^{2} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8 \bigg|}  iRe^{i \theta} d \theta \\&= \oint_{\eta_{R}^{4}}  \frac{\bigg| \log(e^{it})- \frac{1}{2}\log(R^{}) \bigg|}{ \bigg|\frac{e^{2it}}{\sqrt{2R}} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8 \bigg|} \bigg|  iRe^{i \theta} d \theta \bigg|\\& =\oint_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{7 \pi}{4}}  \frac{\bigg| it\log(e^{})- \frac{1}{2}\log(R^{}) \bigg|}{ \bigg|\frac{e^{2it}}{\sqrt{2R}} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8 \bigg|} \bigg|  iRe^{i \theta}\bigg| d \theta \bigg|.  \end{align*} Now finally a precise estimate for $\eta_{R}^{4}$ $$\bigg| \oint_{\eta_{R}^{4}} \frac{\log(e^{it}/\sqrt{R})}{(e^{it}/ \sqrt{R})^{2} + (e^{it} / \sqrt{R})(6) +8}  dz\bigg|  \leq  \text{length}(\eta_{R}^{4})  \cdot \sup_{\eta_{R}^{4}}(g) \leq \pi R \frac{O(\log(R))}{\sqrt{R}} \, \text{as} \, R \rightarrow \infty  $$ Thus proving $(**)$ After achieving our preliminary results now we have that, $(***)$ \begin{align*}
 \bigg( \oint_{\eta_{R}^{1}} g(z) dz + \oint_{\eta_{R}^{3}} g(z) dz \bigg)& = \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty }  \bigg( \oint_{\mu_{R}^{1} } \frac{\log(x+  \sqrt{2R})}{(\log(x+  \sqrt{2R}))^{2} + 6(\log(x+  \sqrt{2R})) + 8} - \oint_{\mu_{R}^{3} } \frac{\log(x - i/ \sqrt{2R})}{(\log(x -i /\sqrt{2R}))^{2} + 6(\log(x - i  /\sqrt{2R})) + 8}   \bigg) \\&= -2 \pi i \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty}\int_{0}^{R} \frac{dt}{t^{2} + 6t + 8} \\&
 \end{align*} Using the Residue Theorem it's easy to observe that: $(****)$ $$ \oint_{\eta_{R}} g(z) dz  = 2 \pi i (\operatorname{Res_{g}}(-2) \cdot + Res_{g}(-4) \cdot 1) = - \pi i \log(2)$$ Finally putting $(****)$, $(***)$, $(**)$ and $(*)$ together yields that the, $$\lim_{R \rightarrow \infty}\int_{0}^{R} \frac{dt}{t^{2} + 6t + 8} = \frac{1}{2}\log(2).$$","['complex-analysis', 'proof-explanation', 'contour-integration']"

2903542,Show that every group of order $224 = 2^5*7$ has an element of order 14.,"I am reading a proof to the problem stated above and I have a few questions that I hope somebody helps me clarify. THe proof goes as follows: Let $G$ be a subgroup of order 224 and $S$ be the set of $7$ Sylow subgroups of $G$. THe cardinality of $S$ divides 32 and is congruent to 1 mod 7, so has to be 1 or 8. Let $H$ be a 2-Sylow subgroup of $G$. It has 32 elements and acts on $S$ by conjugation. This is my first question, how do we know that $H$ acts on $S$ by conjugation. My guess is that since $S$ is the set of $7$-sylow subgroups and the $7$ sylow subgroups are conjugate, then action by conjugation of an element $h \in H$, will just send one 7 Sylow subgroup to another one and so the conjugation of $S$ will just be $S$. Is this right or is there any other reason to have this action? If it is not right, how could we know when to use the action by conjugation? Let $N\in S$ be a $7$-Sylow subgroup, and let $U$ be its stabilizaer subgroup in $H$. The $H$-orbit of $N \in S$ has at most 8 elements, so the stabilizer has $32/8=4$ elements. Here I have another question, why does the stabilizer have just 4 elements? The group $U$ normalizes $N$. Let $\phi:U \rightarrow Aut(N)$ be the group homomorphism associated with the conjugation action of $U$ on $N$. Since $Aut(N)$ has $6$ elements and the number of elements of $U$ is divisible by $4$, the group homomorphism $\phi:U \rightarrow Aut(N)$ cannot be injective. It is still not clear for me why $\phi$ cannot be injective. Can someone explain the relationship between $Aut(N)$ having 6 elements, $U$ being divisible by $4$ and $\phi$ not being injective? We can choose a nontrivial element of order 2 in the kernel of $\phi$. We can also choose $g$ be a generator of $N$. Then $h$ and $g$ commute,$h$ has order 2 and $g$ has order 7. Then $hg$ has order 14.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
2903563,Continuity of argmax?,"Let $f(\cdot,\cdot):\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $\Omega$ a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m$.

In general, however, $f(x,\cdot)$ may contain multiple global maximizers.

2903788,Uniform convergence of convolution of a distribution with a test function,"For an exercise I have to show the following: Let $u_j \to u$ in $\mathcal{D'(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ and let $\phi_j \to \phi$ in $C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Show that $$ \lim_{j\to \infty} u_j * \phi_j = u*\phi $$ in $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. What I have tried so far This means that for all compact sets $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and all orders of differentiations $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, it must hold that
\begin{equation}
 \partial^{\alpha}(u_j*\phi_j) \to \partial^{\alpha}(u*\phi) 
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
uniformly on $K$. I can use that $\partial^{\alpha}(u_j*\phi_j) = u_j*(\partial^{\alpha} \phi_j)$, and since $\partial^{\alpha} \phi_j \in C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$, we only have to show (1) for $\alpha = 0$, because the other values follow by induction. Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then we know that 
\begin{equation}
|(u_j * \phi_j)(x) - (u*\phi)(x)| \leq |(u_j*\phi_j)(x) - (u_j*\phi)(x)| + |(u_j*\phi)(x) - (u*\phi)(x)|
\end{equation}
I will now show that both terms go to zero. We use the translation operator $T_x$ ($T_x \phi(y) = \phi(y-x)$) and the reflection operator $S$ ($S\phi(y) = \phi(-y)$). Now the first term is given by
\begin{equation}
(u_j*\phi_j)(x) - (u_j*\phi)(x) = u_j(T_x \circ S(\phi_j-\phi))
\end{equation}
Because of the convergence of $\phi_j$ we know that there exists a compact set $A$ such that $\text{supp }\phi_j \subset A$ and $||\phi_j-\phi ||_{C^k} \to 0$ for all $k$. Hence we find that 
\begin{equation}
\text{supp }(T_x \circ S(\phi_j-\phi)) = x - \text{supp }(\phi_j-\phi) \subset K+(-A) := B
\end{equation}
Since $B$ is the sum of two compact sets, it itself is compact. We can now use the uniform boundedness theorem to find that 
\begin{equation}
|u_j (T_x \circ S(\phi_j -\phi))| \leq c || T_x \circ S(\phi_j -\phi)||_{C^k} = c ||\phi_j -\phi||_{C^k} \to 0
\end{equation} We now look at the second term. Let $v_j = u_j-u \to 0$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Now by the same arguments as above we find by the uniform boundedness theorem
\begin{equation}
|v_j(T_x \circ S\phi)| \leq c || \phi||_{C^k} \leq M
\end{equation}
Now for $x,y \in K$ we find that 
\begin{equation}
|v_j*\phi(x) - v_j*\phi(y)| \leq |x-y| \sup_{z \in K} \partial (v_j*\phi)(z) \leq |x-y|M
\end{equation}
So that for all $\epsilon > 0$ we can pick $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{M}$ and $|x-y| < \delta$ implies $|v_j*\phi(x) - v_j*\phi(y)|<\epsilon$. We now invoke the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem to find a uniformly convergent subsequence $v_{j_k}*\phi \to 0$. Since $v_j \to 0$ it must be that $v_j*\phi \to 0$ uniformly on $K$. My question I feel the first part of the proof is good and complete, but I am not so sure about the second part. Could you please point out if there are any mistakes, or if there are some missing arguments?","['convolution', 'distribution-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series']"

Now if I multiply the relation between the matrices for $A_{i}$ i get that $A_{i}A_{j}A_{i}=-A_{j}$ wich means that $A_{j}$ and $-A_{j}$ are similar and because they need to share determinant it has to be 0 if the dimension of the space is odd.
