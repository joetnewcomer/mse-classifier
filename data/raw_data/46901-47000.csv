471436,The law of large numbers with dependent random variable,"Consider a sequence of i.i.d. random variables $\left\{X_i\right\}_i$, and let $Y$ be another random variable. Can we say something regard the convergence of the following series
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf\left(X_iY\right)
$$ 
as $n\to\infty$ (assume that $f$ is some ""nice"" function) ? If $Y$ was not there, then we obviously could use the law of large numbers to claim that the above sum converge in probability to $E(f(X))$. But, with $Y$, the summands are dependent and thus we cannot directly apply the law of large numbers, right? EDIT : The answer to this question is as follows (credit to Did): If one assumes that $Y$ is independent on the sequence $(X_i)$, then it can be shown that the series converges a.s. to the conditional expectation $E(f(X_1Y)\mid Y)$. This can be shown by using backwards martingale convergence theorem (actually a refined proof of the SLLN using the backwards martingale convergence theorem). If, however, $Y$ do depend on the the sequence $(X_i)$, then there is nothing much to say (in general).","['probability-theory', 'law-of-large-numbers', 'probability-limit-theorems', 'probability']"

471458,Numerical integration over a surface of a sphere,"I am integrating a double integral in spherical coordinates over the surface of a sphere in MATLAB numerically. Although I have changed the relative and absolute tolerance I get the feeling that this algorithm never terminates. And when I checked the values of my function that MATLAB had evaluated everything looked fine, no huge oscillations, no singularities. Do you know whether there are other algorithms that I could use which work faster and still give me reliable results? So the sphere sits at $(0,0,0)$ and has a radius of $10^{-6}$. Don't be confused that the $y$-component is not shown, I took this one as being fixed in order to plot this. Okay, maybe I define my problem a little bit better: I want to perform this integration as fast as possible with an accuracy that should be about $10^{-1}$ or $10^{-2}$, this is sufficient. Of course, I thought about adding this lower precision to the integral2 function, but still, this function is so slowly that it is useless for what I am currently doing here.","['numerical-methods', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

471500,Almost complex structures on a manifold and its exotic copy,"Consider a compact simply-connected smooth $4$-manifold $M$ and its exotic copy $M'$.
Identify the underlying topological manifolds. Dold-Whitney theorem guaranties ($\mathbb R$-linear) isomorphism of their tangent bundles. Can we say that these bundles are isomorphic over $\mathbb C$ in cases where the manifolds has almost complex structures? More precisely, let be $b_2^+$ be odd. Then both manifolds admit almost complex structures. Assume that $M$ (and $M'$) is not spin, in this case there is at most one almost complex structure for a given first Chern class ( see the answer ). So the space of almost complex structures for both manifolds is parametrized exactly by characteristic elements $\underline{w}_2$ satisfying $\underline{w}_2^2=3sign(M)+2\chi(M).$ Is it true that for any choice of almost complex structures on $M$ and $M'$  with the same Chern class the tangent bundles are actually $\mathbb C$-isomorphic? I'm not sure but it seems that in fact the argument of Peter Teichner in the mentioned answer still works here perfectly well, since the obstruction to the uniqueness is purely topological. If so, then I apologize for wasting your time.","['almost-complex', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-topology']"

471547,$L^p$ derivative vs normal derivative.,"Let $f, g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be Lebesgue measurable functions, and let $1 \leq p < \infty$. If $f, g \in L^p$ and
$$ \large \lim_{y \rightarrow 0} \normalsize \left\| \frac{f(\bullet + y) - f(\bullet)}{y} - g(\bullet)\right\|_p= 0,$$
where $\|~\|_p$ is the $L^p$ norm, and we integrate with respect to the omitted variable, then we say that $f$ is $L^p$ differentiable, and $g$ is the $L^p$ derivative of $f$ . Now, suppose $f \in L^p$ and $f$ is differentiable in the usual sense . Moreover, assume that $f^{\prime} \in L^p$. My questions are: 1) Does it follow that $f$ is also $L^p$ differentiable and $f^{\prime}$ is it's $L^p$ derivative? 2) What if we assume that $f$ is $C^1$, in addition to the other hypotheses? Here's what I've tried: under the above hypotheses, we have that
$$\left| \frac{f(x + y) - f(x)}{y} - f^{\prime}(x)\right|^p \longrightarrow 0, ~\text{as}~y \rightarrow 0,$$
so we could apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem (switching from $y$ to an arbitrary sequence $(y_n)_n$ of course) if we could show that the above quantity is bounded by some fixed $L^p$ function of $x$ alone, that is, some function that doesn't depend on $y$.

The first algorithm produces a lower standard deviation of 1138, but intuitively, this value is close to the mean of 1155, so my gut is that the distribution is very wide. On the other hand, the second algorithm produces a larger standard deviation of 2683, but this value is small compared to the mean of 32170.

Currently, I'm trying to find the splitting field of $(x^{15}-5)(x^{77}-1)$ over $\Bbb Q$, find the degree, and determine if it's a Galois extension. Now, I know that the right polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial, hence has degree $\varphi(77)=60$, over $\Bbb Q$. The left polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein's Criterion, hence adjoining $\sqrt[15]{5}$ gives a degree 15 extension and as a separate extension, adjoining $\zeta_{15}$ (a primitive $15^{th}$ root of unity) gives a degree $8$ extension. Since $8$ and $15$ are relatively prime, I know that the degree of the extension for the splitting field of $x^{15}-5$ is $120$. All of this seems well and good, but now I'm lost.

471659,Probability of being up in roulette,"A player bets $\$1$ on a single number in a standard US roulette, that is, 38 possible numbers ($\frac{1}{38}$ chance of a win each game). A win pays 35 times the stake plus the stake returned, otherwise the stake is lost. So, the expected loss per game is $\left(\frac{1}{38}\right)(35) + \left(37/38\right)(-1) = -\frac{2}{38}$ dollars,

I don't think so. $v=0$ is one solution, but it need not be the only solution because $f$ need not be one-to-one. Is this correct ?

Then $g(v) \in V''$ is a map from $V'$ to $F$. Now lets define this map as $g(v)(f)=f(v)$. Now to prove that $g$ is one to one we need to prove that $g(v)=0$ implies $v=0$. Now $g(v)=0$ implies $g(v)(f)=0 \forall f \in V'$ which implies $f(v)=0$ then it is concluded that $v=0$. This is confusing to me.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

471860,Generalizing the natural numbers - has this been studied before?,"The ordinals numbers generalize the natural numbers and satisfy a generalized induction principle. However, the algebraic properties of the ordinal numbers aren't so good. For example, ordinal sums are neither commutative, nor left-cancellative. It was pointed out in the comments that these deficiencies can be remedied by working with the Hessenberg sum of ordinals. However, this introduces a new problem, which is that despite the fact that $1 \leq \omega$, nonetheless the equation $1 \boxplus x = \omega$ has no ordinal-valued solution (intuitively, it would have be $x = \omega - 1$). Here I am using $\boxplus$ to denote the Hessenberg sum. So, I was trying to generalize the natural numbers in a different way, sacrificing proof by induction but preserving all those nice algebraic properties. I came up with the following idea, but haven't seen it anywhere. Has the following idea been studied? In what follows, lets take $\mathbb{N}$ to start at $1$. So $$\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\cdots\}.$$ Also, let $\mathbb{M}$ denote the positive rational numbers, with the convention $0 \notin \mathbb{M}.$ Then $\mathbb{N}$ embeds naturally into $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{M},$ each of which embed naturally into $\mathbb{Q}$. We will try to recreate this system of embeddings. Note that what follows is highly speculative, and there may be severe mistakes. Let $\mathbb{N}'$ denote the set of all (non-zero) univariate integer polynomials with positive leading coefficient, ordered lexicographically. Then $\mathbb{N}'$ is closed under addition and multiplication, and these operations are commutative and associative on $\mathbb{N}'.$ We also have distributivity of multiplication over addition. Furthermore, for all $a,b \in \mathbb{N}',$ I believe the following hold. If $a < b,$ then for all $x \in \mathbb{N}'$ we have $x+a < x+b$ and $xa < xb.$ The following are equivalent. In particular, i implies ii and ii implies iii. i. There exists $x$ satisfying $x+a=b$. ii. $a < b$ iii. There exists unique $x$ satisfying $x+a=b$. For all $x \in \mathbb{N}'$ we have the following. If $x+a=x+b$, then $a=b.$ If $xa=xb$, then $a=b.$ Now let $\mathbb{Z}'$ denote the set of all univariate integer polynomials, ordered lexicographically. Thus $\mathbb{N}' = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}' \mid x > 0\}.$ Also, $\mathbb{Z}'$ is an integral domain. Furthermore, for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}',$ I believe the following hold. If $a < b,$ then for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}'$ we have $x+a < x+b.$ If $a < b,$ then for all $x \in \mathbb{N}'$ we have $xa < xb.$ There exists $x \in \mathbb{Z}'$ satisfying $x+a = 0.$ For all non-zero $x \in \mathbb{Z}'$ such that $xa=xb$, we have $a=b.$ Now recall that $\mathbb{M}$ is our notation for the positive rational numbers. By analogy, let $\mathbb{M}'$ denote the set of all equivalence classes of ordered pairs $(a,b) \in \mathbb{N}'$ with equivalence defined such that $$(a,b) \sim (a',b') \;\Leftrightarrow \; ab' = a'b.$$ Most likely, the set $\mathbb{M}'$ can be equipped with addition, multiplication in the usual way. Furthermore, define $$[(a,b)] < [(a',b')] \Leftrightarrow ab' < a'b.$$ I'm guessing that this is well-defined, and that the order relation interacts nicely with addition and multiplication. Finally, we can construct an ordered field $\mathbb{Q}'$ in at least two different ways. One way is to replace $\mathbb{N}'$ with $\mathbb{Z}'$ above. The order relation also needs to be defined in a more complicated way; presumably, the following definition will do the trick. $$[(a,b)] < [(a',b')] \Leftrightarrow (bb' > 0 \wedge ab' < a'b) \vee (bb' < 0 \wedge a'b < ab').$$ This is basically just the definition I got off Wikipedia's section on the formal construction of the rational numbers . Another, most likely simpler approach would be to define $\mathbb{Q}'$ by gluing together two copies of $\mathbb{M}'$ with an element $0$ wedged between them. Presumably, both approaches to constructing $\mathbb{Q}'$ give us the same result, and this would be our first major theorem. Finally, I'm guessing that we get the usual system of embeddings. So $\mathbb{N}'$ embeds naturally into $\mathbb{Z}'$ and $\mathbb{M}',$ and both these structures embed naturally into $\mathbb{Q}'.$ Indeed, its probably safe to view these embeddings as inclusions.","['ring-theory', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"
471898,When does an equation of this type have a closed-form solution?,"Suppose I have an equation of the form $f(x) + a x f'(x) + b = 0.$ Note: I am not looking for a general solution to this equation. I am not interested in solving an ODE of this type! Read below. I am looking for functions $f(x)$ that let me solve for $x$ explicitly (they need not be true for all $x$, so we are not looking at a differential equation per se!). So far I could just come up with $f(x) = p x^r + q$, $\ \ \ \ \ \ r\neq 0,$ which has the trivial solution $x^* = \left(-\frac{b+q}{p(1+ar)}\right)^{\frac{1}{r}}$. Another idea is to solve for the differential equations $f(x) = \kappa * \left(x f'(x)\right)^2 + C\ \ \ $ and $f(x) = \kappa * \left(x f'(x)\right)^{1/2} + C$. Inserting either function into the original equation will lead to a quadratic equation in $x f'(x)$ which implies two solutions for $x f'(x)$. With some ""luck"", these might be explicitly solvable for $x$. However, I'm wondering whether there is a more systematic approach -- and more importantly, whether I have overlooked some other simple examples. Many thanks in advance!

Proof. Suppose $x^n = y^n$ and $n$ is even. We consider the following cases. Case 1. $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$. Now suppose, for the sake of contradiction, $x \neq y$. Then $x > y$ or $x < y$. If $x > y$, then $0 \leq y < x$, so $y^n < x^n$. But this contradicts our assumption that $x^n = y^n$. Similarly, $x < y$ leads to a contradiction. Thus $x = y$. Case 2. $x \geq 0$ and $y < 0$. Now suppose, for the sake of contradiction, $x \neq -y$. Then $x > -y$ or $x < -y$. If $x > -y$, then $0 < -y < x$, so $(-y)^n < x^n$. Since $n$ is even, it follows that $y^n < x^n$. But this contradicts our assumption that $x^n = y^n$. Similarly, $x < -y$ leads to a contradiction. Thus $x = -y$. Case 3. $x < 0$ and $y \geq 0$. Applying case 2 with $x$ and $y$ interchanged, we get $y = -x$. Therefore $x = -y$. Case 4. $x <0$ and $y < 0$. Then $-x > 0$ and $-y > 0$. Applying case 1 to $-x$ and $-y$, we get $-x = -y$.

472061,Help to understand proof to show that a function is uniformly continous in a certain interval (Spivak),"This excerpt relates to the following proof: If $f$ is continous on $[a,b]$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous $[a,b]$. For $\epsilon > 0$ let's say that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on $[a,b]$ if there is some $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $y$ and $z$ in $[a,b]$, if $|y-z|<\delta$ , then $|f(x)-f(z)|<\epsilon$ Consider any $\epsilon > 0$. Let $A=\{x:a\leq x \leq b$ and $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on $[a,x]\}$ Then, the proof went on to show that $A$ has a least upper bound, $\alpha$ and that $\alpha=b$. Here's the part I don't understand: ... So $f$ is surely $\epsilon$-good on the interval $[\alpha - \delta_0, \alpha + \delta_0]$. On the other hand, since $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $A$, it is also clear that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on $[a, \alpha- \delta_0]$. I don't understand how we can conclude that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good $[a, \alpha- \delta_0]$ just from knowing that $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $A$. How do we know that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good for each number in the interval from $a$ up to and including $\alpha-\delta_0$? Here's my understanding of the proof: Suppose $a=1$ and 5 is the least upper bound of $A$. Then, just by knowing that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on $[5-\delta_0,5+\delta_0]$ we can conclude that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on the intervals $[a,2],[a,3]$ all the way to $[a, 5-\delta_0]$. I feel like I am missing some property of the least upper bound that is preventing me from understanding this proof. The proof also claims that $f$ is $\epsilon$-good on $[a, b - \delta_0]$ which I also don't understand but I guess the explanation would be similar to $f$ being $\epsilon$-good on $[a,\alpha-\delta_0]$.

472074,How does definition of nowhere dense imply not dense in any subset?,"In some topological space $X$, a set $N$ is nowhere dense iff $\text{Int}\left(\overline{N}\right)=\emptyset$,
where Int is the interior, and overbar is closure. How can I show this is equivalent to the statement ""any non-empty
open subset of $X$ contains an open non-empty subset containing no elements of $N$.""? I can use the following equivalences:
$
N\text{ is nowhere dense}\iff\overline{N}\text{ is nowhere dense}\iff\text{Ext}\left(N\right)\text{ is dense in }X\;\iff\overline{N}^{c}\text{ is dense in }X
$ My attempt: 1) I assumed the quoted statement is false - that there is a non-empty open set $V$
  in which $N$ is dense. 
It follows that $V\subset\overline{N}$
 . On the other hand, N
  is nowhere dense, so $V\subset\overline{\text{Ext}\left(N\right)}$
  also holds. I concluded that $V\subset\partial N$
 , but I don't see what this achives.. 2) I think I might have a proof - is the following correct? $\text{Int}\left(N\right)=\emptyset\iff\text{Int}\left(\overline{N}\right)=\emptyset$,
so we can in particular take $N_{1}=\overline{N}\setminus\partial N$,
and have $\text{Int}\left(N_{1}\right)=\emptyset$. But $\text{Int}\left(N_{1}\right)=N_{1}$,
so $N_{1}=\emptyset$. Additionally, $\text{Int}\left(N_{1}\right)$
is the greatest subset of $N_{1}$ (itself), so any subset of
it must be empty. The boundary contains no open subsets, so the family
of nowhere dense sets whose closure is $\overline{N}$ are just closed sets: they're
all unions of the empty set with a subset of a the boundary - a
closed set. This means the greatest open subset of nowhere dense set
is $\emptyset$.","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"

This is actually the same question, so I know the solution. Now I want to solve this using generating functions. I've tried several ways to generate a function but none give me the same answer as on the question posted above (7731309000). We know there are 5 odd numbers, and we need at least one of each. So we need to pick 5 odd numbers from a collection of 5. We can pick each number 1 to 6 times (since we take each one time). This should give us the following:
$$(x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 +  x^6)^5$$ Because we have to pick it at least once we get no ""$1 +$"" and we can pick at most 6 of each number. Now, for the remaining 5 numbers we can do as follows: For each number we get: $$(1+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5)^5$$ This means that we can pick it once, twice,.. five times, and this for each number  so we raise it to the power of 5. So we need to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $$(1+x^2+x3+x^4+x^5)^5 \cdot (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 +  x^6)^5$$ But this doesn't give me the same answer.

Assuming that no angle in the triangle is larger than 120 degrees, there's an algorithm for doing that that goes something like this: Construct equilateral triangles on two sides of our given (original) triangle. Connect the new vertexes with the opposite vertexes from the original triangle. Find the point in which the connecting lines intersect - that's the Fermat point of our original triangle. (paraphrased from Wikipedia ) Now, I want to do this programmatically, so I can't do it by drawing. It would be ideal if I had a formula for the coordinates of the Fermat point, but I've tried Google and I can't find it. Anyway, what I plan on doing is to write a program that does something like this: Calculate the coordinates of the third vertex in the equilateral triangles for two sides of the original triangle. Calculate the equations of the lines that connect the new vertexes with the opposite vertexes from the original triangle. I can do this because two point uniquely determine a line. Given the two line equations that I got in step 2, calculate the coordinates of the intersection of those lines. Am I missing something? The fact that I can't find a formula for this makes me think that I am, because, if what I'm trying to do is correct, why isn't there a direct formula? I mean, what I'm doing in each step is basically using a formula on what I got from the previous step, so why wouldn't there be a formula to go from step 0 (coordinates of the original triangle) to step 3 (coordinates of the Fermat point)? Furthermore, if there isn't a formula and if I'm not missing anything, is there a simpler way of doing what I'm trying to do?","['geometry', 'triangles']"

I know that: $$ P(X \text{ is even} ) = e^{-\lambda} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{\lambda^{2k}}{(2k)!}$$ but I can't solve the series. I guess that I have to use the fact that $e^\lambda = \sum_{n = 0}^{+\infty} \lambda^n/n!$, but I got stuck. How can I evaluate $P(X \text{ is even})$ (alternative solutions appreciated).","['sequences-and-series', 'probability']"
472448,Connection on pullback bundle,"Let $\mathcal{V}\stackrel{\pi_N}{\longrightarrow}N$ be a $V$-vector bundle on a smooth manifold $N$, let $D$ a connection on this bundle and let $f:M\rightarrow N$ be a smooth function. Then we can define the pullback bundle $f^*\mathcal{V}\stackrel{\pi_M}{\longrightarrow}M$ as the bundle given by all the elements of type $\{(p,v)|p\in M,\ \pi_N(v)=f(p)\}$ (with the obvious projection $\pi_M$). Now I have been told that $D$ induces a connection ${}^fD$ on the pullback bundle which is completely determined by the fact that if $\eta$ is a section of $\mathcal{V}\stackrel{\pi_N}{\longrightarrow}N$ and $v\in T_pM$, then $${}^fD_vf^*\eta=D_{f^*v}\eta$$ I have a feeling that it is not true, because there could be sections of $f^*\mathcal{V}\stackrel{\pi_M}{\longrightarrow}M$ that are not the pullback of any section of $\mathcal{V}\stackrel{\pi_N}{\longrightarrow}N$. Am I wrong or there is really something missing to describe completely ${}^fD$?","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

472477,Is Poincare-Hopf index theorem connected with Leftschetz fixed point theorem?,"Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem: For a compact triangulable space $X$, and a continuous map $f:X\rightarrow X$, we have
  $$\sum_i(-1)^i\mathrm{Tr}(f_*|H_k(X,\mathbb{Q})=\sum_{x\in\mathrm{Fix}(f)}\mathrm{index} _x f$$ Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem: For a compact orientable differentiable manifold $M$, and a vector field $v$ on $M$ with isolated singularities, we have $$\sum_i(-1)^i\dim H_k(X,\mathbb{Q})=\sum_{x\in\mathrm{Sing}(v)}\mathrm{index}_xv$$ Observing the formal similarity between these formulae and the compatibility of the conditions, I came up the idea that they are connected. For one possible connection, I imagined that we can construct a map $f_v:M\rightarrow M$, by letting the points flow along $v$ (in a sufficiently short time?). Then this map is very similar (homotopic?) to $\mathrm{id}_M$, so trace is dimension. And by construction the two index should agree. So we can view the latter as a corollary. But I was not able to realize this. Can anyone tell me how to do it? Or it can be found in some texts?","['fixed-point-theorems', 'differential-geometry']"

472498,Showing that the intersection of all subgroups of order $n$ is normal,"I have been thinking about this problem: ""Suppose that a group $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$.  Prove that the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ of order $n$ is a normal subgroup of $G$."" Unfortunately, I don't have much of a start.  I know that the intersection will be a subgroup of each of the subgroups of order $n$, and thus will have order dividing $n$.  I also know that conjugation preserves the order of elements, which suggests that $xNx^{-1}$ could be a subset of $N$ ($N$ being the intersection of all subgroups of order $n$), but I don't see why conjugation necessarily takes elements of $N$ to other elements of $N$. I'd really appreciate a hint on how to go about showing this.  Thanks.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
472505,Proving that the nested intervals theorem implies that every upper bounded non-empty set has a supremum,"I've been trying to solve a kinda long problem for a few days and can't quite finish it. Prove the equivalence between (1) Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. (2) All cauchy sequences are convergent. (3) If $ (I_n)_{n\geq 1} $ is a family of closed nested intervals so that $|I_n| \rightarrow 0 $ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ there exist a unique $x$ so that $x \in  \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$. (4) Every upper bounded non-empty set has a supremum. (5) Every monotone, upper bounded sequence has a supremum. I managed to get $(1)\rightarrow(2)\rightarrow(3)$ and $(4)\rightarrow(5)\rightarrow(1)$ so I obviously would love to prove $(3)\rightarrow(4)$. I manage to get a decreasing sequence since if there's no supremum then for every upper bound $s$ there exist at least one $\varepsilon > 0$ so that $s - \varepsilon$ is also an upper bound. So I can choose one upper bound $s$ and consider the sequence $(s - \varepsilon_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ that gets closer to the set as $n$ grows, where $s - \varepsilon_n$ is an upper bound for all $n$. Now I'd like to construct a monotonically increasing sequence of elements of the set so that $|A_n - (s - \varepsilon_n)| \rightarrow 0$ but I'm not sure how to do this, or if my decreasing sequence is convenient for this, it does seem quite ugly to work with, but couldn't really come up with an improvement. I've consider taking another direction and proving that (3) implies something else and that in turn that implies (4), but I couldn't find a good way of doing it. Maybe I missed something? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
