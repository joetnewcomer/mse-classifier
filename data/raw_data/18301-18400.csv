151656,Hausdorff dimension of Cantor set,"I know this is probably a easy question, but some steps in the proofs I found almost everywhere contained some parts or assumptions which I think may not be that trivial, so I would like to make it rigorous and clear enough. Here is the question: Let $C$ be the Cantor set with delete the middle third of the interval and go on. The general Cantor can be considered similarly. We want to proof the Hausdorff dimension of $C$ is $\alpha:=\log2/\log3$. So we calculate the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $H^d(C)$ for all $d$ to determine the Hausdorff dimension. Let $C(k)$ be the collection of $2^k$ intervals with length $1/3^k$ in the $k^{th}$-step of construction of Cantor set. It is rather easy to show that $H^{\alpha}(C)<\infty$ by showing that for any covering $\{E_j\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$of $C$ the set $C(k)$ also covers $C$ for $k$ large enough, so we can bound $H^{\alpha}(C)$ from above. Which implies that the Hausdorff dimension of $C$ is less than $\alpha$. To show the dimension is actually equal to $\alpha$, it suffices to show $H^{\alpha}(C)>0$. Now let $\{E_j\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ be any covering of $C$ with diameter $diam(E_j)\le \delta$ for all $j$. How do we show that 
$$\sum_j diam(E_j)^{\alpha}>constant$$ One author (see this link ) made the following assumption: $E_j$ be open, so one can find the Lebesgue number of this covering, and when $k$ large enough, any interval in $C(k)$ will be contained in $E_j$ for some $j$. Hence one can bound the $\sum_j diam(E_j)^{\alpha}$ from below by the ones of $C(k)$. I got confused here: First why we can assume $E_j$ to be open?",['real-analysis']

But if I moreover assume that $K_S^2 > 0$, can we still have $K_S \cdot H = 0$? If $D \cdot H < 0$ for some divisor $D$ and some hyperplane section $H$, does it follow that $H^0(D,\mathcal{O}_S(D)) = 0$?

151767,Find all non-abelian groups of order 105.,"Find all non-abelian groups of order 105. My attempt: $105=3.5.7$. Consider the $3$-factorization, as $5, 7, 35 \not\equiv 1\mod 3$ we have that the sylow $3$-subgroup is normal. Consider now the $7$-factorization. By this we get that there is either $15$ sylow $7$-subgroups or one normal sylow $7$-subgroup. If there are $15$ sylow-$7$-subgroups then $[N_G(P):P]=1$ and then since $P$ is abelian we have that $N_G(P)=C_G(P)$. But this means that we have that P has a normal $p$-complement and so we have that any groups of this form can be represented as: $<x,y |x^{15}=y^7=1, yxy^{-1}=x^\alpha >$ But what $\alpha$ are possible? If there is one normal sylow $7$-subgroup then we have a normal subgroup of order $21$ which is abelian.

By checking each element of $\mathbb{F}_7$ we easily see that this is irreducible. What about separable? Can we look at the formal derivative $f’(x)=3x^2$ which has a double zero at $0$ and hence gcd$(f,f’)=1$ and so $f(x)$ is separable? Example 2: Consider $f(x)=x^p-x+1\in\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. Observe that if $\alpha$ is a root then $\alpha +a$ is a root for any $a\in\mathbb{F}_p$ (because $(\alpha +a)^p=\alpha^p+a^p$). Hence has $0$ is not a root, $f$ is irreducible.

151824,Group isomorphism concerning free group generated by $3$ elements.,"From Jacobson's Basic Algebra I, page 70, Let $G$ be the group defined by the following relations in $FG^{(3)}$:
  $$x_2x_1=x_3x_1x_2, \qquad x_3x_1=x_1x_3,\qquad x_3x_2=x_2x_3.$$
  Show that $G$ is isomorphic to the group $G'$ defined to be the set of triples of integers $(k,l,m)$ with $$(k_1,l_1,m_1)(k_2,l_2,m_2)=(k_1+k_2+l_1m_2,l_1+l_2,m_1+m_2).$$ My thoughts: I was able to show that $G'$ is generated by $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$, since $(h,l,m)=(1,0,0)^{h-lm}(0,1,0)^l(0,0,1)^m$. Letting $(0,0,1)=a_1$, $(0,1,0)=a_2$, and $(1,0,0)=a_3$, I calculate that $a_2a_1=a_3a_1a_2,a_3a_1=a_1a_3,a_3a_2,a_2a_3$. So they look like the satisfy the same relations as the $x_i$. (I'm not sure if this is necessary.) So taking the set $X=\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$, I have a map $x_i\mapsto a_i$, which gives a homomorphism of $FG^{(3)}$ into $G'$ such that $\bar{x}_i\mapsto a_i$, and this homomorphism is in fact an epimorphism since it maps onto a set of generators for $G'$. Thus $FG^{(3)}/K\simeq G'$ where $K$ is the kernel of the homomorphism. Since $G\simeq FG^{(3)}/K$, $G\simeq G'$. I can't quite justify if $G\simeq FG^{(3)}/K$, from the comments, I understand why the generated normal subgroup $K$ is contained in the kernel $\ker\nu$ of the induced homomorphism $FG^{(3)}\to G'$, but I don't follow why $\ker\nu\subset K$. Why does $\ker\nu\subset K$? Thanks.","['free-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

I'm a little thrown off in the preliminary section in a proof regarding complexed valued functions.

First, let $$ F \, = \, \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \quad $$ and $$ u = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta). $$ Then, let
$ F \, = \, \left| F \,\right| u $ where $ F \neq 0 $.

$$ = \; \cos(\theta) \int_a^b \left ( Re \, f \, \right) (x) \, dx + i \cos(\theta) \int_a^b \left ( Im \, f \, \right) (x) \, dx - i sin(\theta) \int_a^b \left ( Re \, f \, \right) (x) \, dx + sin(\theta) \int_a^b \left ( Im \, f \, \right) (x) \, dx $$

151842,Existence of infinite intersection,"The intersection of an infinite family of sets $S_\alpha$ is defined by membership:
$$ (x \in \cap_{\alpha \in A} S_\alpha) \text{ if and only if } (x \in S_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in A).$$ This is probably a silly question, but how do we know that this legitimately defines a set? It doesn't actually construct a single element of the intersection, it just provides a yes-or-no question that can be asked about any potential candidate for membership. This style - definition of a set by properties of it's members - recalls Russel's classic ""set of all sets that don't contain themselves"",
$$(x \in R) \text{ if and only if } (x \notin x)$$ Russel's set $R$ doesn't exist, though the ""definition"" follows the same technique. What's different here? How do we know that the infinite intersection is a well defined concept? I think I can show that an  $\cap_{\alpha \in A} S_\alpha$ exists by transfinite induction, but well-ordering the index set $A$ requires the well ordering principle which is equivalent to the axiom of choice, whereas I've heard that intersection does not require the axiom of choice.

I have some points in 3D space that I can project onto the plane, and I wish to express these points as 2D vectors within a local 2D coordinate system in the plane. The 2D coordinate system should have orthogonal axes, so I guess this is a case of finding a 2D orthonormal basis within the plane? There are obviously an infinity of choices for the origin of the coordinate system (within the plane), and the in-plane $x$ axis $\textbf{i}$ may be chosen to be any vector perpendicular to the plane normal. The 3D unit vector of the in-plane $y$ axis $\textbf{j}$ could then be computed as the cross product of the $x$ axis 3D unit vector and the plane normal. One algorithm for choosing these could be: Set origin as projection of $\left[0\:0\:0\right]^T$ on plane Compute 2D $x$ axis unit vector $\textbf{i}$ direction as $\left[1\:0\:0\right]^T\times\textbf{n}$ (then normalize if nonzero) If this is zero (i.e. $\textbf{n}$ is also $\left[1\:0\:0\right]^T$) then use $\textbf{i}$ direction as $\left[0\:1\:0\right]^T\times\textbf{n}$ instead (then normalize) Compute $\textbf{j}=\textbf{i}\times\textbf{n}$ However, this all seems a bit hacky (especially the testing for normal along the 3D $x$ axis, which would need to deal with the near-parallel case on a fixed-precision computer, which is where I'll be doing these sums). I'm sure there should be a nice, numerically stable, matrix-based method to find a suitable $\textbf{i}$ and $\textbf{j}$ basis within the plane.

152081,"For an $n$-dimensional object, how many types of holes are possible?","Update 2012-06-06 : At some point I'll attempt to answer my own question by using a dual-fluid model that places the dimensionality and connectivity of ""solids"" and ""holes"" on an equal footing. With that same model, I should also be able to explain how Betti numbers are related. Incidentally, the dual-fluid model seems to provide an interesting alternative way of viewing Poincaré duality. Original Question 2012-05-31: (Please bear with my non-standard terminology; I am not a topologist.) In $n=3$ space an object such as an $n$-ball can have only type of hole. For the simplest case of one such hole in one $3$-ball, the result is a ring. If the ring is smoothed down and narrowed, the result is a $1$-sphere or circle. It is easy to generalize ""hole"" to mean any topologically distinct, simple subtraction of substance from an $n$-ball. By ""simple subtraction"" I mean this: Define a removal $n$-ball that is initially identical to the first ball. Expand the removal ball slightly by uniformly expanding the $m$-ball defined by the $m$ axes, and contract it slightly by uniformly shrinking the ($n-m$)-ball defined by the remaining subspace of ($n-m$) axes. Intersect the resulting distorted removal ball with the first one. For the first $n$-ball, erase all substance from the locations where it intersects with the removal ball. This procedure results in three additional hole types for $n=3$ space: voids ($m=0$), splits ($m=2$), and erasures ($m=3$). The original definition of a hole for $n=3$ space becomes $m=1$. Thus using this generalized hole definition, $n$-space has $(n+1)$ hole types with labels $m=0,1,\ldots,n$. The $m=0$ case is always a void, $m=n-1$ is always a split, and $m=n$ is always an erasure. The space has $(n-2)$ ""true holes"" labeled $m=1,\ldots,n-2$, with the true holes being those that (a) leave the $n$-ball connected, and (b) provide a path through it. (If the second criterion (b) is omitted, $m=0$ voids could also be called true holes.) The thinning procedure mentioned earlier simplifies the resulting holes and provides an easy way to observe structure that is shared across all $n$-spaces. For example, an ($n=2,m=0$) void looks like a washer or ring drawn on paper, and it thins into a $1$-sphere. An ($n=3,m=1$) hole looks like a bagel, and also thins into a $1$-sphere. This pattern produces a very simple rule: Every $n$-space has ($n-2$) true holes, and each of those holes $m$ has the same fundamental topology as an ($n-m-1$)-sphere. Thus our space has one true hole, ($n=3,m=1$), with the fundamental topology of a $1$-sphere or circle, and a void, ($n=3,m=0$), which has the fundamental topology of a $2$-sphere (a hollow shell). For $n=4$ there are two true holes: ($n=4,m=1$) with the form of a $1$-sphere, and ($n=4,m=2$) with the form of a $2$-sphere. Addendum 2012-06-05: There's no reason for me to be overly abstract about any of this: A ""1"" indicates a ""filled n-cell"" rather than a vertex, and ""0"" an empty n-cell. Each solid shown is assumed to exist in empty space, so surrounding zeros are implied. Notice the (x,y) gap at the center of (4,2), which would allow any sufficiently thin plane-like object in 4D to pass through. At the same time, the object itself retains its structural integrity by forming a closed loop in the (z,t) plane. That loop can be seen easily in the 3x3 units surrounding the empty (x,y) unit. The (4,2) hole has no analog in 3D, although ironically its fundamental form is the same as a circle or a ring. It's just that in 4D a toroid ends up with two axes of freedom through its hole instead of just one. Addendum 2012-06-01: Here is a way to visualize why the different $m$ holes have significantly different properties. In 3D, a ring is a compact object containing a single (genus 1) ($n=3,m=1$) hole. Now the interesting thing about a single hole is that it enables a curious but well-defined relationship between two objects residing in the same $n$-space. In particular, if the hole is of size $m$, you can use it to ""point to"" any $m$-dimensional location on an object that is indefinitely larger in $m$ dimensions than the hole object. I'll call this the pointer theorem for future reference. The pointer theorem sounds a bit abstract, but it's really quite easy to visualize. Imagine a ring on a wire, for example. The ring is a compact object with a ($n=3,m=1$) hole in it, and the wire is another 3D object that is indefinitely larger than the ring in exactly one dimension. The pointer theorem therefore applies, so you should be able to ""relocate"" the ring to any point along the indefinitely long axis of the wire. And it's true! The ring can in fact be moved to ""point to"" any location on the wire, no matter how longer the wire is. Moreover, the relationship is non-trivial, since you cannot remove the ring from the wire without covering at least some other locations on the wire; the ring is ""strung"" onto the wire. While 3D space allows only one type of true hole, notice that a split ($n=3,m=2$), which consists of two ""nearby"" but separate objects, qualifies as a generalized hole. Does the pointer theorem apply to splits? Yes. The extended object for an $m=2$ hole, regardless of the space size $n$, is a sheet-like object that is indefinitely larger than the hole object in $m=2$ dimensions. Can the two such nearby objects point to any location on such a sheet? Yes. An ordinary sewing machine is a pretty good example, since it has paired parts above and below an indefinitely large sheet of fabric, and those paired parts can be used to stitch any point on a sheet of fabric. The problem in 3D, however, is that unlike the approximation provided by a sewing machine, a real split breaks the compact object apart into two disconnected units. Now look at the 4D case. For $n=4$ you have have two ""true holes,"" namely ($n=4,m=1$) and ($n=4,m=2$). Unlike the 3D case, either one of these holes can be used to create an continuous (internally connected) compact 4D object with genus 1. The pointer theorem says that an ($n=4,m=1$) hole can be used to point to any location on an indefinitely large rod-like or wire-like $n=4$ object. This makes the ($n=4,m=1$) hole into the 4D equivalent of a ring on a wire. Intriguingly, however, the reduced form of ($n=4,m=1$) is not a $1$-sphere, but a $2$-sphere, since $m-n-1=2$. That makes it topologically equivalent to a hollow ball in 3D space, rather than a ring! What is happening conceptually is that any 4D wire would be orthogonal to our 3D space, and would show up in intersection with our space as a $3$-ball trapped inside the hollow sphere. But what about that other 4D hole, ($n=4,m=2$)? It is a ""sheet-like"" hole, just like the one in the earlier 3D split example. The pointer theorem implies that you can ""string"" a compact object with a genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) hole onto an indefinitely larger sheet-like 4D object, and then use that compact object to point to any location on the sheet. What's fascinating conceptually is that a compact genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) object would remain both intact and ""stuck"" on such a sheet in very much the same way that a ring gets ""stuck"" on a long wire in 3D. My own phrase for this is the 4D abacus effect. Just as in 3D an abacus bead can be moved anywhere on a wire but remains trapped on that wire, in 4D a ""bead"" that has a ($n=4,m=2$) hole can be moved anywhere on a sheet, but remains trapped on that sheet. Note that this type of genus 1 ($n=4,m=2$) bead is equivalent to a $1$-sphere or ring, just as in the 3D abacus case. If the sheet was rotated into 3D space, this ring would show up as mysteriously connected pieces above and below the sheet. It would look very much like the 3D split in fact, with the addition of a hidden 4D link that keeps the pieces joined. There are infinitely many different abaci, incidentally. For every $n$-space the corresponding $n$-abaci uses $1$-sphere type beads -- that is, compact genus 1 objects with ($n=n,m=n-2$) holes -- strung onto ($n-2$)-objects. The $5$-abacus is interesting because it attaches a movable ring to any location within a 3D ""object."" Thus it might provide an interesting physics model for folks who like to model particles as loops attached to and mobile within a 3D space. You can also get a lot more complicated than that, of course, such as by increasing the genus and/or mixing together abaci of different dimensionality. The main point in all these examples of the pointer theorem is this: Holes with different $m$ cannot be equivalent because they cannot be strung onto the same kinds of objects. In 4D for example, an ($n=4,m=1$) hole can be strung onto a wire-like 4D object, but not onto a sheet-like 4D object. The other true hole type for 4D, ($n=4,m=2$), can be strung onto a sheet-like 4D object, however. There's another more subtle difference I should mention. While you can in principle use a ($n=4,m=2$) ""bead"" to point to any location on a wire-like 4D object, you cannot ""string"" such a bead onto that object. It simply falls off! To see why, imagine trying to capture a thread between two disconnected objects in 3D. The same problem of too many degrees of freedom applies for trying to string a ($n=4,m=2$) bead onto a wire-like 4D object. So, for any given embedding space $n$, its set of ($n+1$) true and generalized hole types {$m=0,1,\ldots{n}$} are all fundamentally different in terms of the types of interactions they provide between objects in that space. Finally, an observation: If embedding spaces are not used, the difference between these holes remain, but they get a lot harder to observe and characterize (I think). So with all of that, here's my simple question: Where do I find all of this in topology? I'm assuming there must be a similarly simple and regular way to classifying holes in higher dimensional spaces in terms of their sphere analogs, but I've had a lot of trouble finding it the last time I looked. (That was a couple of years ago, so maybe I need to look again.) Most of what I saw dived into the algebraic complexity and special terminology weeds so quickly that I had trouble figuring whether they were really relevant.","['general-topology', 'dimension-theory-analysis', 'geometric-topology', 'low-dimensional-topology']"

I repost the question here (hopefully it falls within forum's category this time) and will really appreciate if someone can shine light on it. I need to do an inverse Laplace transform of a function with essential singularities for a specific problem. I find it is very similar to an equation J. Noolandi worked out in one of his papers in 1977 ( Phys. Rev. B 16 , 4466 (1977)). I have taken a snapshot of the Appendix page where the math problem and the solution were given (view it here) . But I don't quite get some part of the solving process which I need help on deciphering. If I can understand what he was doing, my specific problem can be solved. So now let's take the problem in the Appendix of Noolandi's paper for example. The function is $\displaystyle \tilde I(s) = \frac{1-\exp(-a(s)t_0)}{a(s)}$ where $\displaystyle a(s)t_0 = \Sigma_{i=1}^n \frac{s\omega_i}{s+r_i} t_0 = \Sigma_{i=1}^n \frac{sM_i}{s+r_i}$. ""$s$"" is the variable. $\omega_i$, $r_i$, $t_0$, and $M_i$ are all real numbers greater than zero. The question is how to get inverse Laplace transform $L^{-1}[\tilde I(s)]$. It looks like the author used Residue Theorem to evaluate the contour integral $\int_C \tilde I(s) \exp(st) ds$, but the hard part is the singularities are essential singularities, thus the residues can not be got conventionally. However, it seems that the author constructed a contour and solved it numerically . I don't get Equation A5-A8 in the Appendix, and don't understand how to determine the parameter $R$ and $R_1$ he introduced in (probably something related to numerics). Could anyone please help point out what he was doing? Thanks very much! By the way, the author also said the inverse Laplace transform could also be evaluated using  Laplace transform tables.

The actual value was 111.77, so a pretty darn good guess if you ask me! Anyway... Beyond gloating about my estimate being the closest one :-) this reminded me of a problem I'd speculated about when I was a kid.  It was about ideal choices for coin values.

Then the structure sheaf is $\mathcal{O}(X_f) = R_f$, the localization of the ring $R$ with respect to the multiplicative subset $\{ 1,f,f^2,\ldots \}$. Exercise I-20 in E-H is to calculate the points and sheaf of functions for some schemes 1) $X_1 = \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)$ This shouldn't be to hard - there is exactly one (closed) point corresponding to the maximal ideal $(x)$ in which case $X_1 = \{(x)\}$. Thus the only open sets are $\emptyset \subset X_1$ and then $\mathcal{O}(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\mathcal{O}(X_1) = \mathbb C[x]/(x^2)$ Is this correct? 2) $X_2 = \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x](x^2-x)$
Here we should have exactly two (closed) points: $(x),(x-1)$. Call these $\{ a,b \}$.
The topology should then be $\{\emptyset,\{a \}, \{ b \}, \{a, b\} \}$ (the discrete topology). 
Again we have $\mathcal{O}(\emptyset) =0 $ and $\mathcal{O}(\{ a,b \}) = \mathbb C[x]/(x^2-x)$. Now

152298,How is the hyperplane bundle cut out of $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^\ast \times \mathbb{P}^n$?,"[Question has been updated with more context and perhaps a better explanation of my question.] Source: Smith et al., Invitation to Algebraic Geometry , Section 8.4 (pages 131 - 133). First, a brief set-up, whose purpose will become obvious in a minute.  Note that everything here is over $\mathbb{C}$. The tautological bundle over $\mathbb{P}^n$ is constructed as follows.  Consider the incidence correspondence of points in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ lying on lines through the origin, $B = \{(x, \ell) \;|\; x \in \ell \} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \times \mathbb{P}^n$, together with the natural projection $\pi : B \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$. [...] The tautological bundle over the projective variety $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ is obtained by simply restricting the correspondence to the points of $X$... Next, it's shown that this bundle has no global sections, in the case $X = \mathbb{P}^1$: A global section of the tautological bundle defines, for each point $p \in \mathbb{P}^1$, a point $(a(p), b(p)) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ lying on the line through the origin corresponding to $p$.  Since the assignment $p \mapsto (a(p), b(p))$ must be a morphism, we see that projecting onto either factor, we have morphisms $a, b : \mathbb{P}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.  But because $\mathbb{P}^1$ admits no nonconstant regular functions, both $a$ and $b$ are constant functions.  But then both are zero... So far, so good.  Now: The hyperplane bundle $H$ on a quasi-projective variety is defined to be the dual of the tautological line bundle:  The fiber $\pi^{-1}(p)$ over a point $p \in X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ is the (one-dimensional) vector space of linear functionals on the line $\ell \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ that determines $p$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$.  The formal construction of $H$ as a subvariety of $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^\ast \times \mathbb{P}^n$ parallels that of the tautological line bundle. This, I don't understand.  Specifically, whereas the set of $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ such that $v \in \ell$ was a subspace of $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, the set of linear functionals $f : \ell \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ appears to be a quotient of $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^\ast$, rather than a subspace.  So I don't see how to perform the parallel construction here. In particular , any method that cuts something out of $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^\ast \times \mathbb{P}^n$ would seemingly allow us to carry out the argument above and show that the hyperplane bundle has no global sections, which is false.",['algebraic-geometry']

Because we can multiply all of the variables by a constant without affecting the inequality, we assume $x_n=1$. Assume we have proven the inequality for $n-1$. Then $$\left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^q\right) \le \left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^p\right)^{\frac{q}{p}}$$ It suffices to show that $$\left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^q\right) + 1 \le \left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^p+1\right)^{\frac{q}{p}}$$ This is equivalent to $$\left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^q\right)\le \left(\sum_1^{n-1} |x_j|^p+1\right)^{\frac{q}{p}}-1$$ So we need to show that if $f(x)=x^{q/p}$, then $f(x+1)\ge f(x)+1$.

Possible Duplicate: Taking Seats on a Plane There are 100 seats on a plane and 100 passengers, each with his ticket. However, the first person to enter the plane discovers he has lost his ticket, so he picks a seat at random. Afterwards, every new passenger sits in his place if it is free, and otherwise picks a vacant seat at random. You are the last to enter the plane. What is the probability you'll sit in your seat? I managed to solve this using induction (i.e. marking by $A(n)$ the probability where $n$ is the number of passengers and then finding a recursive formula for $A(n)$ which is quite simple).

152520,$L^p$ norms of Fourier transform of solutions of hyperbolic Burgers' equation at the time of first blow-up,"I am struggling to understand the behavior of the Fourier transform (in the $x$ variable) of initially smooth solutions of the hyperbolic Burgers' equation in 1-D, $ \partial_t u + u~ \partial_x u =0$ . I start with a smooth and rapidly decaying initial condition $u(x,t)=u_0(x)$ on $\Bbb R$ . This solution evolves in time until it breaks down. At the time of first breakdown $t=T$ I look at the Fourier transform $\hat u(k,T)$ of the solution $u(x,T)$ . In particular, I am trying hard to understand how and why the $L^p$ norms of the Fourier transform $\hat u$ remain finite at the time of first blow-up for $p>1$ . I think that if one uses weak (or Lorentz) norms, then this non-blow-up extends even to the weak $L^1$ norm. The only way I have been able to understand this property is via the convervation law for the $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ .   For the $\|u \|_{L^\infty} $ norm to be defined at the time of first blow-up, the Fourier transform needs to remain in a weak $L^1$ space.  Interpolation explains the rest. My question is whether there is a way to understand the non-blow-up of the said $L^p$ norms of the Fourier transform $\hat u$ without invoking the conservation law for the $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ . What I seek is some kind of direct Fourier-analytic way to see what is going on. I have reached an impasse.
