1974134,Periodic points and dense orbits,"I am reading a proof (theorems about shifts) in an introductory dynamical systems book which uses the following fact: Definitions: Let $A$ be an $m\times m$ adjacency matrix $(a_{ij})$ and $\Sigma_m=\mathcal{A}_m^\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of infinite two-sided sequences of symbols in $\mathcal{A}_m:=\{1,\dots,m\}$. Now, we let $\Sigma_m^+=\mathcal{A}_m^\mathbb{N}$ be the infinite one-sided sequences. We say that a word or infinite sequence $x$ in the alphabet $\mathcal{A}_m$ is allowed if $a_{x_i,x_{i+1}}>0$. Hence we let $\Sigma_A\subset\Sigma_m$ be the set of allowed two-sided sequences and $\Sigma_A^+\subset\Sigma_m^+$ the set of allowed one-sided sequences. Now, they say that if all entries of some power of $A$ is positive, then in the product topology $\Sigma_A^+$ and $\Sigma_A$, periodic points are dense and there are dense orbits. They don't explain why this is true and since I failed proving this by myself, I was wondering whether someone can help me.

1974187,smooth embedding between manifolds,"I'm sightly confused about the definition of an embedding between manifolds. (There seems to be several formulations and apparently they are meant to be equivalent.) From what I gather a smooth map $f: M \to N$ between manifolds is an embedding if it is (1) an immersion (smooth and derivative is injective), and (2) it is a topological embedding (homeomorphism onto image) With this definition, the image of an embedding is a manifold (a submanifold of $N$) and $f$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. To fully understand this definition, can someone give me an example of (a) an injective immersion that is not an embedding (for example if the image is not a manifold), and (b) the necessity of the requirement of it being an immersion (for example a smooth injection whose image is not a manifold). PS. I have seen an example of (a) that is the injective immersion from $\mathbb{R}$ to the figure 8 in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by taking $\pm \infty$ to the intersection of the figure 8 from top right/ bottom left. But I'm having trouble confirming why it's not a homeo onto image (it's clearly bijective but why is it not continuous wrt to the subspace topology of the figure 8 in $\mathbb{R}^2$?)","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

1974386,Convergent nets and closed sets in a proof of Schechter's book,"In my current obsession to learn equivalences of the Ultrafilter Lemma, I found the Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations, by Eric Schechter - by the way, a marvelous book in my opinion. In this book (section 28.29), the proof that Banach-Alaoglu Theorem implies (in ZF) the Ultrafilter Lemma goes like this: we fix a set $\Omega$ and a proper filter $\mathcal{F}$ on $\Omega$; we set $X=\{f\colon \Omega\to\mathbb{R}|f$ is bounded$\}$ equipped with the sup norm; by Banach-Alaoglu, the closed unit ball on $X^*$ is $w^*$-compact (compact in the weak$^*$ topology), call it $V$; the map $\varphi\colon \Omega\to V$ defined as $\varphi_\omega(x)=x(\omega)$ for $\omega\in \Omega$ and $x\in X$ is an injection, so we may suppose that $\Omega\subset V$; the set $\mathcal{K}=\{w^*\text{-cl}(F): F\in\mathcal{F}\}$ is a family of $w^*$-closed subsets of $V$ with the finite intersection property, hence there exists $v\in \bigcap\mathcal{K}$; we define $\mu\colon \wp(\Omega)\to\mathbb{R}$ by setting $\mu(S)=v(1_S)$, where $1_S\colon \Omega\to \{0,1\}$ is the characteristic function of $S$; in order to see that $\mathfrak{u}=\{G\subset\Omega:\mu(G)=1\}$ is an ultrafilter that contains $\mathcal{F}$, the author uses the following fact for any fixed $F\in\mathcal{F}$, since $v\in w^*\text{-cl}(F)$, there is some net $(\omega(\alpha):\alpha\in A)$ in $F$ such that $\varphi_{\omega(\alpha)}\stackrel{w^*}{\longrightarrow}v$. My problem concerns this last step. I know that in any topological space $Y$, $y\in Y$ and $A\subset Y$, $(\dagger)$ $\quad$ $y\in\overline{A}$ if and only if there exists a net of elements in $A$ converging to $y$. However, the only proof I know about this fact uses the Axiom of Choice. Finally, my questions : There is a way to prove $(\dagger)$ without the Axiom of Choice? If not, what am I missing in order to prove the 8th step? Thank you.

(which I mean $f$ should be like $f(g)$ or $f(\varphi)$, ($g$ and $\varphi$ are functions), but not $f(x)$ where $x$ is a real number) And is this the main difference between a function and a functional? But I also see examples like ""let $f\in D'(\Omega)$ be a distribution defined by $f(x)=2x$ when $x>0$ and $f(x)=0$ when $x\leq 0$)"". What does this mean? Is $f$ here a distribution or a function after all? Secondly, a distribution $f$ operating on a function $\varphi$ should be defined by $<f,\varphi>$ equals something, but why both in my note and some textbooks, when discussing the multiplication by $C^{\infty}$ functions and differentiation, they all began with $<af,\varphi>=\int_\Omega af\varphi dx=<f,a\varphi> \forall \varphi \in D(\Omega)$. Here suppose $f\in C$ (or $f\in L_{loc}^{1}(\Omega)$) and $a\in C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and $<\partial^\alpha f,\varphi>=\int_{\mathbb R^N}(\partial ^\alpha f)\varphi dx=...$ Why here the distributions are set as integral automatically?

Even just providing a reference would be great. One definition I've seen is: Let $\mathrm{Der}(A)$ be the $k$-linear derivations on $A$, and let $A$ act on itself by left multiplication. Then $D(A)$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{End}_k(A)$ generated by $A$ and $\mathrm{Der}(A)$.

I can clearly see how this meets my definition of a topology, namely that $\emptyset, X \in T$; $\bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} T_{\lambda} \in \tau$ whenever $\{T_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \subseteq \tau$; $\bigcap_{k=1}^{n} T_{k} \in \tau$ whenever $\{T_{k}\}_{k=1}^{n} \subseteq \tau$. My question: I was wondering if this could be a topology induced by some metric $d$ on $X$, however. Or more generally, how one could determine whether a particular topology is possibly induced by a metric. I have seen that the discrete topology on any $X \neq \emptyset$ given by $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$ is induced by the discrete metric $\mu$, for instance, which has motivated my question as to whether some of the other topologies introduced may be metric-induced as well. I attempted to think of some metric which would induce my above topology, but have thus far been unsuccessful - but also not sure how I might prove that one cannot exist.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

Prove that $f$ is bounded on $E$ My (Attempted) Proof Since $E$ is bounded, put $\alpha = \sup E$, $\beta = \inf E$. Now since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $E$, we only have to prove convergence of $f$ as $x \in E \to \alpha$ and $x \in E \to \beta$. So let $\{x_n\}$ be a  Cauchy sequence and fix $\epsilon > 0$. Let $\delta$ be such that $d(f(p), f(q)) < \epsilon$. Now take $N$ so large such that $m, n > N \implies d(x_n, x_m) < \delta$. We then have $d(f(x_n), f(x_m)) <  \epsilon$ (By uniform continuity of $f$) Thus $\{f(x_n)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, and thus converges to some point $L \in \mathbb{R^1}$ $$\begin{aligned}\therefore \text{As} \ \ x_n \to \beta \ , \  \ f(x_n) \to L_1\\

Secondly, if you have any criticism on my proof-writing skills, please let me know, as I'm always looking to improve.

As I understand it, intuitively the slope of a line is a number $m$ that quantifies the amount it inclines from the horizontal, and its direction.

Therefore, the value of $y$ changes by an amount $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ units per unit change in x , which is exactly the rate of change in $y$ with respect to $x$ , since it quantifies the amount the value of $y$ changes per unit change in $x$.

Use integrating factor $\mu(x)$ to ensure exactness:

One solution is available given this particular definition of the logarithm function as a limit: $$\log x = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^h - 1}h  \quad \text{, or equivalently} \quad\log x = \lim_{n \to \infty} n(x^{\frac1n} - 1)$$ This solution is an algebraic maneuver that involves terms like $~e^{b\log b},~$ where one first obtains $~\log b~$ as a limit, and then only after another limit can one arrive at $~b^b~$ eventually. My question is this: how does one evaluate the limit more directly without this seemingly redundant path of log on the exponent?

Given that euchre is played with a deck consisting of 9s, 10s, Js, Qs, Ks, and Aces, and trump was a different suit, this was one of the 3 lowest cards in the deck. That's a pretty awesome way to win the game, but it gets better.  In addition to playing the 9$\spadesuit$, she also took all 5 tricks in that hand and therefore got two points to win the game instead of the standard one point you get for only making your bid. Adding on to the improbable nature of this game, the 9$\spadesuit$ was turned up five times as the bid card -- she turned it up three times, her father turned it up once, and I turned it up once. The game ended with scores of 10, 8, and 3, which meant, since hers was the only two point hand, we played 19 hands. I refer those who are unfamiliar with Euchre to the rule set here . Goal I'd love to figure out the probability of the 9$\spadesuit$ turning up 5 times as the bid card and then extend that probability to include the fact that the the 9$\spadesuit$ was also the card used to win the game by taking all tricks in the final hand. Start of a Solution Because you shuffle between each hand, I believe the probability of any one 9 (since we would have been just as flabbergasted with any 9) coming up 5 times as the bid card in a game of 19 hands is: $$ P_{\text{particular card coming up 5 times}} = \frac{4}{24} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{24}\right)^{4} = \frac{1}{1,990,656} $$ But here is where my stats fail me.  How do I model the probabilities of the hand being played? If I want to model the probability of the 9$\spadesuit$ being the card to win the last hand, do I have to include the probability of the 9$\spadesuit$ not being the last card during the other hands?  I'm thinking something like this pseudo equation: $$ P_{\text{dealt the right 9}} \cdot P_{\text{playing the 9 last}} \cdot P_{\text{taking all tricks}} \cdot P_{\text{something about winning the game?}} \cdot P_{\text{something else?}} $$ I believe we can calculate the first probability via: $$ P_{\text{dealt the right 9}} = 1 - (P_{\text{not being dealt the right 9}}) = 1 - (\frac{23}{24} \cdot \frac{22}{23} \cdot \frac{21}{22} \cdot \frac{20}{21} \cdot \frac{19}{20}) = \frac{5}{24} $$ Can I calculate the second probability via this?  This result is non-intuitive to me. $$ P_{\text{playing the 9 last}} = 1 - P_{\text{not playing the 9 last}} = 1 - (\frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{4}{5} $$ Could I use a pre-calculated probability for the fact that she took all 5 of the tricks on the last hand?  If I found a resource online that gave the probability of taking all 5 tricks in a Euchre hand, how would I integrate that?","['probability', 'card-games']"

$$ {1 \over x(1-x)} = {1 \over x} + {1 \over 1-x} $$

From this point of view, we know from differential geometry (very classical examples, indeed) that there are curves that ""go through infinite length in a bounded amount of time"". Of course, at these examples, the speed of these curves increase infinitely (""goes to infinity""). I have very rough ideas concerning Relativity Theory (I'm a mathematician, not a physicist) but I know that, for example, the speed a object can reach is bounded by the speed of light, and that mass, lengths and even the time are distorted at very high speed (near the speed of light).

Its Lie algebra, when considered as a vector space, is given by $T_e G$, the tangent space of $G$ at the identity element $e$. However, in order to fully describe the Lie algebra associated with $G$ we must also describe the commutator $\left[\cdot,\,\cdot\right]:T_eG^2\to T_eG$ and show that it obeys the three axions: bilinearity, alternativity and the Jacobi identity. Following Wikipedia, one defines first for any $g\in G$ left multiplication on $G$ by $g$ as $$ l_g:G\to G$$ given by $$ x\mapsto gx$$and a left-multiplication invariant vector field $X\in TG$ is one which obeys for every $\left(g,\,h\right)\in G^2$ $$ \left(d l_g\right)_h X_h = X_{gh} $$ where $\left(d l_g\right)_h:T_hG\to T_{gh}G$ is the differential of $l_g$ at $h$. We define $Lie\left(G\right)$ as the vector space of left-multiplication invariant vector fields. Apparently $G\times Lie\left(G\right)$ is isomorphic to $TG$ via $$\left(g,X\right)\mapsto\left(g,X_g\right)$$ so that we get a $\natural$ isomorphism $Lie\left(G\right)$ with $T_eG$ given by $$Lie\left(G\right)\ni X \mapsto X_e\in T_eG$$This last isomorphism we call $\phi$. Now apparently there is a Lie bracket structure on $TG$ which induces a Lie bracket structure on $Lie\left(G\right)$: for any $X$ and $Y$ in $TG$ we have $$ \left[X,\,Y\right]_{TG}= X\left(Y\left(\cdot\right)\right)-Y\left(X\left(\cdot\right)\right)$$ This in turn can be pushed forward to a define our desired Lie bracket on $T_e G \equiv \frak{g} $ via: If $X$ and $Y$ are any tangent vectors in $T_eG$ then $$\left[X,\, Y\right]_{T_eG}=\phi\left[\phi^{-1}\left(X\right),\,\phi^{-1}\left(Y\right)\right]_{TG}$$ My question is: is there now any easier way to describe $\left[\cdot,\,\cdot\right]:T_eG^2\to T_eG$?

  proving that the series $$\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\sin(2^n)}{n}$$ is

for some $\varepsilon>0$ is enough to prove the claim by Abel summation. In the same spirit, it is quite common to employ Weyl's inequality / Van der Corput's trick to prove the convergence of $\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\sin(n^p)}{n}$. In our case, however, we do not have an additive base of $\mathbb{N}$ made by perfect powers associated with some exponent, hence an additive base of finite order, so the estimation of the exponential sums appearing in the right side of $(1)$ is more difficult. Assuming that for an infinite number of primes $p$ the element $2$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}/(p\mathbb{Z})^*$ (Legendre's conjecture), we may probably regard $[1,N]$ as a subset of $\mathbb{Z}/(p\mathbb{Z})$ (for a huge $p$) and prove there is enough cancellation to grant $(1)$. However, Legendre's conjecture seems quite out-of-reach at the moment. Integral extimations techniques, that turned out to be pretty effective in other contexts , are almost ineffective here, since $\sin(2^x)$ oscillates too fast, so that there is no reason for expecting that
$$ \sum_{n=M+1}^{M+N}\sin(2^n)\approx \int_{M}^{N+M}\sin(2^x)\,dx, $$
so, even if $\lim_{N\to +\infty}\int_{1}^{N}\sin(2^x)\,dx$ is convergent by Dirichlet's test, there is little use of that. However, the series $g(\xi)=\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\sin(2^n\xi)}{n}$ is convergent for almost every $\xi$, since $g\in L^2\left(-\pi,\pi\right)$. Additionally, the statement there is enough cancellation to ensure $(1)$ appears to be equivalent to (or, at least, a consequence of) the statement the digits $0$ and $1$ in the binary representation of $\pi$ are equidistributed . It is hard to believe that is not the case, and the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula $$\pi=\sum_{k\geq 0}\frac{1}{16^k}\left(\frac{4}{8k+1}-\frac{2}{8k+4}-\frac{1}{8k+5}-\frac{1}{8k+6}\right)\tag{2}$$

1976510,"Conjecture regarding integrals of the form $\int_0^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^n}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$.","I have been playing around a bit with integrals of the form $$I(n)=\int_0^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^n}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,\,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,$$ and I am trying to obtain a closed form solution for $I(n).$ I believe the special cases $I(1)$ and $I(2)$ are somewhat well-known, but I will go over them. When $n=1,$ we have $$I(1)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This can be easily shown to be zero by performing the substitution $x=1/y,$ which will yield $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=-\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ Thus, $I(1)=0.$ Clearly, this can be generalized to all odd integers, and $I(2n+1)=0.$ In the case of $n=2$, first observe through the same substitution as above that $$\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_1^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This implies that $$I(2)=2\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,$$ which is an easier integral to work with. Performing the substitution $x=e^{-y}$ yields $$I(2)=2\int_0^\infty y^2\left(e^{-y}-e^{-3y}+e^{-5y}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)\,\mathrm{d}y.$$ Using the identity $$\int_0^\infty x^2 e^{-ax}=\frac{2}{a^3},$$ we obtain $$I(2)=4\left(\frac{1}{1^3}-\frac{1}{3^3}+\frac{1}{5^3}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)=4\cdot\frac{\pi^3}{32}=\frac{\pi^3}{8}.$$
I'm not sure how this infinite series is evaluated, but I found this result in a book. I used Mathematica to check a few more values, and I found that $I(4)=5\pi/32,\,I(6)=61\pi/128,\,$ and $I(8)=1385\pi/512.$ Clearly the pattern is $$I(2n)=A_{2n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2n+1},$$ where $A_{2n}$ is some constant. It turns out that these constants are the Euler numbers, which are the coefficients $E_k$ corresponding to the series $$\operatorname{sech}x=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{E_k}{k!}x^k.$$
All Euler numbers corresponding to odd $n$ are zero, and the first few even Euler numbers are $E_0=1,\, E_2=-1,\, E_4=5, \,E_6=-61,\,$ and $E_8=1385.$ Thus, I have conjectured that $$I(2n)=(-1)^n E_{2n} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2n+1}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+.$ I suppose this could be extended to $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ thusly:
$$I(n)=i^n E_n \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{n+1},$$ since $E_n=0$ for odd $n.$ So the question, of course, is how to prove this. I tried generalizing the method I used for $I(2),$ and I found that $$\int_0^\infty x^n e^{-ax}=\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}},\,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.$$ Using this, I obtained $$I(2n)=n!\left(\frac{1}{1^{n+1}}-\frac{1}{3^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{5^{n+1}}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)=n!\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^{n+1}}.$$ Mathematica wasn't able to evaluate this sum, even for the case of $n=2.$ It gives some expression involving multiple zeta functions, with which I have no experience. Even if we can't prove this, I would be interested to know why the Euler numbers might appear here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1976613,Showing product of normal varieties is normal,"let $X, Y$ be two affine normal varieties, over an algebraically closed field $k$, I want to show that $X\times Y$ is still a normal affine variety. There is an answer for "" Does the fiber product of two normal varieties remain normal? "", but I haven't learned scheme theory, so I am looking for a proof I am able to deal with. So far, I can prove the result assuming $Y$ is affine space $Y=\mathbb A^n_k$. I list out sketch of my proof below. The strategy is that use the fact that the affine variety over a over an extended field $\mathbb A^n_{k(X)}$ is normal, (or equivalently affine space is geometrically normal ). Using this fact, if we have an element in $k(X\times \mathbb A^n_k)$ integral over $k[X\times \mathbb A^n_k]$, we can make the denumerator very simple (only relies on variables in $X$). However, this method cannot be generalized, so I have no idea to prove the general case $X\times Y$ is normal. Any suggestion or reference would be thankful. proposition Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $X\subset \mathbb A^m_k$ a normal affine variety, then the product variety $X\times \mathbb A^n_k$ is affine normal. sketch of proof : First $k[X\times \mathbb A^n_k]=k[X][y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$,  $k(X\times \mathbb A^n_k)=k(X)(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$. We want to prove that the coordinate ring $k[X][y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$ of $X\times \mathbb A^n_k$ is integrally closed in its fraction field $k(X)(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$. Let $f\in k(X)(y_1,...,y_n)$ be an element which is integral over $k[X][y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$. We break up the proof into two steps: Step 1 : Show $f\in k(X)[y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$ This is easy because polynomial ring over a field is always a normal domain. Step 2 : Show $f\in k[X][y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$ Since step 1 is down, now $f=\sum_{i=1}^l u_i v_i$ for $u_i\in k(X)$, and $v_i\in k[y_1,...,y_n]$, also $v_i$'s are linearly independent over $k$. Note that if we restrict the integral relation $$f^k+a_{k-1}f^{k-1}+...+a_1f+a_0, \ \ \ \  a_i\in k[X][y_1,...,y_n]$$ to a fixed point $p$ in $\mathbb A^n_k$, then it gives a integral relation of $f(p)=\sum_{i=1}^l u_iv_i(p)\in k(X)$ with coefficients $a_i(p)\in k[X]$:$$f(p)^k+a_{k-1}(p)f(p)^{k-1}+...+a_1(p)f(p)+a_0(p), \ \ \ \  a_i(p)\in k[X]$$ By normality assumption of the variety $X$, $f(p)\in k[X]$. Now, we claim that we can always pick $l$  points $p_1,...,p_l$ in $\mathbb A^n_k$ such that the vectors $(v_1(p_i),...,v_l(p_i)), 1\le i\le l$ are linearly independent (this is an easy argument since $k$ is infinite), therefore $u_i$'s are linear combination of $f(p_i)$'s, thus $u_i\in k[X], \forall i$. Thus $f=\sum_{i=1}^l u_i v_i\in k[X][y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$, as desired. $\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$",['algebraic-geometry']

OK, so I know this multi-step method is called the Nystrom method. I also know that the method I come up with needs to have the following form: $y_{i+1} = y_{i-1} + h(\alpha f_{i-2} + \beta f_{i-1} + \gamma f_{i} + \phi f_{i+1})$ Here $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\phi$ are constants I have to find. $h$ is just the timestep interval size, and $f_p = f(t_p,y_p)$ for some arbitrary $p$. Beyond this, I'm completely stuck, and don't know how to even get started. Through only a few examples I found online, it seems what sometimes works is to use Taylor series to expand about the point $t_{i-1}$ and then somehow construct a system of equations for the constants to solve for them. Unfortunately the examples I've found haven't been really illustrative though. So when I tried this I got nowhere helpful pretty fast.

I was thinking of proving this by either technique. Let $A= \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}$, and $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{F}$. Technique 1. Consider the following 4 matrices with determinant 1: $M_1= \begin{bmatrix}e & 0\\0 & 1/e\end{bmatrix}$, $M_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -f\\1/f & 0\end{bmatrix}$, $M_3 = \begin{bmatrix}1/h & 0\\0 & h\end{bmatrix}$, and $M_4 = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1/g\\-g & 0\end{bmatrix}$.

Show that the sum of a countable number of $U_i$s is $A$. The problem I have here is that I don't know how to proceed from here. I don't know if either of these will be considered correct, though.
