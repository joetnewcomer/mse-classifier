129179,Direct limits of completely positive maps on $C^*$-algebras vs. operator systems,"I believe I've heard, as part of the ""lore,"" that the category (operator systems, completely positive maps) has direct limits, whereas the category ($C^*$-algebras, completely positive maps) does not.  Or perhaps one had to tweak the morphisms by specifying ""unital"" or ""contractive"".  I would appreciate either a reference that discusses direct limits of completely positive maps on some category or other, or an example (if indeed one exists) of a direct system of ($C^*$-algebras, CP maps) where the limit object is not a $C^*$-algebra?  My best guess would be to iterate a CP map from some $A$ to itself, but I don't really know what the limit would look like.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-algebras', 'reference-request']"
129183,Center of Clifford Algebra depending on the parity of $\dim V$?,"While reading about the structure of Clifford algebra, there were two facts listed as bullet points about the center of Clifford algebra based on the parity of the dimension of the underlying vector space that I'm now curious about. Say you have a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $K$, such that $\operatorname{char} K\neq 2$, and $G$ is a symmetric bilinear form. Let $\mathrm{Cl}_G(V)$ denote the corresponding Clifford algebra. Apparently, if $\dim V$ is even, then the center of $\mathrm{Cl}_G(V)$ coincides with $K$. However, if $\dim V$ is odd, then the center is actually a $2$-dimensional vector space over $K$. These seem like good interesting facts to know, but I couldn't find an authoritative reference containing a proof of either of them. Does anybody here have a nice proof of either one/both I could read over? I'd appreciate it very much, thanks.","['vector-spaces', 'clifford-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"

If the answer to 1. is affirmative, can we replace $$\inf_{\psi \in D(A)} \frac{(A\psi, \psi)}{\lVert \psi\rVert^2} \quad \text{and}\quad \sup_{\psi \in D(A)} \frac{(A\psi, \psi)}{\lVert \psi\rVert^2}$$ with $$\inf_{\psi \in D} \frac{(A\psi, \psi)}{\lVert \psi\rVert^2} \quad \text{and}\quad \sup_{\psi \in D} \frac{(A\psi, \psi)}{\lVert \psi\rVert^2}$$ where $D\subset D(A)$ is a dense subset?

129327,Characterizations of the form domain for unbounded selfadjoint operators,"This question follows from this one and especially from Willie Wong's answer: link . In Reed & Simon's book Methods of modern mathematical physics , vol. I, pag.277, the form domain of a self-adjoint operator $(A, D(A))$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is defined by passing to a spectral representation , that is by taking a unitary isomorphism $$U \colon H \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^N L^2(\mathbb{R}, d\mu_j), $$ (where $N\in \{1, 2 \ldots +\infty\}$ and $\mu_j$ are finite Borel measures) such that $(UA)\varphi=(x\psi_j(x))_{j=1}^N$ [ $A$ is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by $x$ ]. The sought domain is then said to be $$Q(q)=\left\{ (\psi_j)_{j=1}^N \ :\  \sum_{j=1}^N \int_{-\infty}^\infty \lvert x \rvert \lvert \psi_j(x)\rvert^2\, d\mu_j <+\infty \right\}.$$ Question . Let $$D(\lvert A\rvert^{1/2})=\left\{ \varphi \in H\ :\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty \lvert \lambda \rvert\, d\big(E_A(\lambda)\varphi, \varphi\big)<+\infty\right\},$$ where $\{E_A(\lambda)\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}}$ is the spectral family of $A$ (cfr. Reed & Simon vol. I Theorem VIII.6). Is it true that $Q(q)=D(\lvert A\rvert^{1/2})$? I believe the answer to be affirmative. This should make for a characterization of the form domain a bit more transparent than the one based on spectral representations. For example, it is not immediately clear that the latter is independent on the particular representation chosen.","['operator-theory', 'spectral-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 6 years ago . Improve this question Grandi's series is defined as: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n = 1 - 1+1-1+\cdots$$ By plainly looking at this series it seems like the value of it is either $1$ or $0$ by doing the following groupings: $$(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots=0+0+0+\cdots=0$$ OR $$1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\cdots=1+0+0+\cdots=1$$ However, if we say $$A = 1 - 1+1-1+\cdots$$ Then $$1-A = 1-(1 - 1+1-1+\cdots)=1 - 1+1-1+\cdots = A$$ and thus $A = 1/2$ We know that $\frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots$ which, when $x=1$, evaluates the sum as $1/2$ once again. One final proof that the series converges to $1/2$ is as follows (similar to the above proof):
$$1/2=\frac{1}{1+1} = 1-\frac{1}{1+1} = 1-\left(1-\frac{1}{1+1}\right)=1-\left(1-\left(1-\left(1-\left(\cdots\left(1-\frac{1}{1+1}\right)\right)\right)\right)\right) = 1-1+1-1+\cdots$$ This series apparently confused many of the great minds in math.  Many, many more methods are known that also show that this sum is equal to $1/2$. Why do many seemingly divergent sums such as this one seem to converge?
Some other examples that can be evaluated include $1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + \cdots = -1/4$, $1 − 2 + 4 − 8+ \cdots = 1/3$, $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +\cdots=-1/2$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\cdots=-1/12$, etc. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandi's_series for more information about this series.","['sequences-and-series', 'divergent-series', 'calculus', 'infinity']"

We let $f^{\prime}$ denote the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$, defined in the formal way: $f^{\prime} = \sum\limits_{m\in \mathbb Z} mf_m t^{m-1}$, where $f_m$ is the coefficient of $f$ before $t^m$. Theorem: The coefficient of the Laurent polynomial $f^n f^{\prime}$ before $t^{-1}$ is zero. Let me sketch the standard proof of this theorem, to show what I want to avoid: First of all, it is very easy to verify the Theorem in the case $n=0$. Hence, we can apply the Theorem to $f^{n+1}$ and $0$ instead of $f$ and $n$, and conclude that the coefficient of the Laurent polynomial $\left(f^{n+1}\right)^0 \left(f^{n+1}\right)^{\prime}$ before $t^{-1}$ is zero. Since $\left(f^{n+1}\right)^0 \left(f^{n+1}\right)^{\prime} = \left(f^{n+1}\right)^{\prime} = \left(n+1\right)f^n f^{\prime}$ (by the Leibniz identity or the chain rule, as you wish), this yields that the coefficient of the Laurent polynomial $ \left(n+1\right)f^n f^{\prime}$ before $t^{-1}$ is zero. Now, if $n+1$ is not a zero-divisor in $R$, then this immediately yields that the coefficient of the Laurent polynomial $f^n f^{\prime}$ before $t^{-1}$ is zero. Thus, the Theorem is proven in the case when $n+1$ is not a zero-divisor in $R$. In particular, the Theorem is proven in the case when $R$ is a polynomial ring over $\mathbb Z$. But since the statement of the Theorem (for a given value of $n$ and for a given up-degree and low-degree of the Laurent polynomial $f$) is a polynomial identity in the coefficients of $f$, proving it when $R$ is a polynomial ring over $\mathbb Z$ automatically entails that it holds for any commutative ring $R$ (by an elementary fact which has many names, among them ""principle of permanence of identities"" ). Thus, the Theorem is proven. Question: Is there a (not too long or ugly) proof of the Theorem which avoids the use of the principle of permanence of identities? For $n=0$ and $n=1$, the Theorem can be shown by ""expanding"" the polynomial, but this seems to become messy for higher $n$'s. I believe there should be some smart induction-over-$n$ argument (maybe through generalization of the Theorem).","['residue-calculus', 'commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

The real problem is how to label the four points and filter out all concave and degenerate configurations (like, for example: $A=B$). If the labeling is possible (convex case found), the four points should be labeled such that $AC$ and $BD$ are diagonals of a convex quadrialteral.

I think this basic approach will work for me, but I would like to be a little more methodical. I would like to add a few good German analysis texts to my library and begin working my way through those. From the user t.b., in particular, I learned of the Analysis texts by Königsberger and since they come highly-recommended I will probably get these.

My question though concerns their pedagogical value; for those who are familiar with these texts, are they easy to learn from or are the basically specialist-level reference texts? By way of comparison, for example, I find Royden's Analysis well-written and sufficiently detailed to follow. Rudin, not so much. So if you are familiar with these texts and can comment on their pedagogical value or if you could suggest other German analysis (or algebra/topology) texts that would be good to read, I would appreciate your comments.","['reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'mathematical-german']"

For example, if you want to process 3/4, then you would feed in 3, leave a gap, then repeat.  This could be encoded as a binary sequence: 1110. If you want to process 3/5, then a simple sequence would be 11100.  This however leaves an unnecessarily large gap.  Perhaps they want as constant a rate as possible down the line.  A better sequence would be 11010.  Where the gaps are spread as far as possible (remembering that the sequence repeats). Hopefully this has explained the problem.  I shall now attempt to phrase it more mathematically. Given a fraction $a/b$, generate a binary sequence of length $b$, that contains exactly $a$ ones, and where the distance between zeros is maximised if the sequence were repeated. In my attempts so far, I've worked out the building blocks of the sequence, but not quite how to put it together.  For instance, 77/100 should be composed of 8 lots of 11110 and 15 lots of 1110.

130080,Discontinuity in function; order of integration matters,"I'm struggling a bit with Chapter 10 of Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" and I was hoping to get some help here. I'll post the problem and my current progress. Exercise 2: For $i = 1, 2, \ldots$ let $\phi_i \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^1)$ have support in $(2^{-i}, 2^{1-i})$ such that $\int \phi_i = 1$. Let 
$f(x, y) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^\infty [\phi_i (x) - \phi_{i+1} (x)] \phi_i (y)$. Then $f$ has compact support in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $f$ is continuous except at $(0, 0)$, and $\int dy \int f(x, y) dx = 0$ but $\int dx \int f(x, y) dy = 1$. Observe that $f$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$. Progress First, note that the supports of the $\phi_i$ are disjoint. Suppose $\phi_i (x) \neq 0$ on the set $S_i$ for each $i$. Then if $x \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$, or if $y \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ we have $f(x, y) = 0$. If $x \in S_i$ for some $i$ then $x \not\in S_j$ for $j \neq i$, so $f(x, y) = -\phi_i (x) \phi_{i-1} (y) + \phi_i (x) \phi_{i} (y) = \phi_i(x) [\phi_{i} (y) - \phi_{i-1} (y)]$. Note that $f(0, 0) = 0$ since $0$ is not in the support of any $\phi_i$. Then if we can show that $f$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$, by the epsilon-delta definition of continuity we know that $f$ is not continuous at $(0, 0)$. Since $\int \phi_i = 1$ we know that the support for each $\phi_i$ must be non-empty. Examine the neighborhood of radius $r$ centered at $(0, 0)$. If we can show that $f$ is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r < 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$, then by extension it is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r \ge 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$. Then suppose $2^{-a} \le r < 2^{1-a}$. Suppose for sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded in this neighborhood. Then let $\alpha, \beta$ be the values in $\mathbb{R}^1$ such that $f(\alpha, \beta) \ge f(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^1$ with $|(x, y) - (0, 0)| < r$. Suppose $\alpha \in S_i$. We must then have $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ or $\beta \in S_{i}$. If $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = -\phi_i (\alpha) \phi_{i-1} (\beta)$, and if $\beta \in S_i$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = \phi_i (\alpha) \phi_i (\beta)$. ( ~~~ I don't know how to proceed from here. I need to generate an ordered pair in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that creates a larger value for $f$, but I don't know how to judge the magnitude of $\phi_i (\alpha), \phi_i (\beta)$, or $\phi_{i-1} (\beta)$. I think I need to use $\int \phi_i = 1$, but to be totally honest I don't know what that means, or how to use it. ~~~ ) Since the $\phi_i$ are continuous, we know that the $S_i$ are collections of intervals. Then $(0, 1) \backslash \cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ is also a collection of intervals. We showed earlier that $f(x, y) \neq 0$ iff for some $i$ we have $x \in S_i$ and $y \in S_{i} \cup S_{i - 1}$. Then $f(x, y) \neq 0$ over a set whose closure is a collection of $2$-cells, implying by definition that the support of $f(x, y)$ is a collection of $2$-cells. Since $2$-cells are compact and the union of a collection of compact sets is compact, the support of $f(x, y)$ is compact. To show that $f$ is continuous (other than at the origin), we can examine $f$'s behavior in cases. If $x > 1$ or $x < 0$ and $y > 1$ or $y < 0$, then we can construct a disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$ centered at $(x, y)$ that does not intersect the set determined by $0 < x, y < 1$, so $f(x, y) = 0$ on this neighborhood since $\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i \subseteq (0, 1)$; this satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. If $x = 1$ or $y = 1$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Since $S_1$ is a collection of intervals in $\mathbb{R}^1$, it has a maximum; let it be $s$. Since $\overline{S_1} \in (1/2, 1)$, and since $\overline{S_1}$ is a collection of closed intervals, we know that $s < 1$. Then if $x = 1$ or $y = 1$, we have that $f(x, y) = 0$ on the neighborhood centered at $(x, y)$ with radius $1-s$. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $x = 0$ and $y \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $y \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' < 2^{-(i+1)}, y' \in [a, b]$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $y \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (y) = 0$ for all $y \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $y = 0$ and $x \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $x \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' \in [a, b], y' < 2^{-i}$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $x \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity.

If so, I'd like to know this clever way; if not, I'd like a hint how we know there is not.

Obviously we can not write every with 72 characters--but what about a given $N$?  Can we know? Simple Example : given the prime 92709463146717245465044514107163, we might choose the short expression $3^{67}-2^{70}$. Motivation : I run a web site which lists the largest known primes. Today, to make the list of the top 5000 a prime must have 223,656 digits.  Most of these primes have very specific forms, most often $a\cdot b^n\pm1$, but sometimes something with more character like the prime $$2^{810655} + 2 V(1, 2, 810653) + 1$$ (244032 digits), or the prime $$(121227 \cdot 2^{384976} + 3)^2 + 24398127601 \cdot 2^{384962}$$ (231,789 digits).  Occasionally folks are purposefully (or accidentally) obtuse, and try to submit the digits instead of a simple form.  Usually I can find a simple form by playing with the numbed a bit in Maple. Another time a mathematician submitted what they claimed (at the time) was ""the largest known prime with no special form,"" a claim I did not know how to check, yet still I wondered: can I shorten this expression enough to fit on a list that only allows a 100 or so characters?

So I wonder, can the task mentioned above be automated (or at the least be sped up with mathematical insight)? Fortunately folks are rarely this obtuse and often just threatening to delete their prime is often enough for them to give me a nicer form, but sometimes they do not know of one (e.g., an ECPP record prime which makes the list by being of the 20 largest known (proven this way), even though these records are only about 10k digits). But more than the practical question, I am just interested in the question: can we know if there is a very short form (using specified operations/functions/small integers) exists?  (What might be the shortest we can hope for?) A Programming question? Perhaps, but surely a good program would be guided by some mathematical principles.  There must be something better than my usual brute force method using a greedy algorithm (e.g., subtracting large terms of the form $a\cdot b^n$ and then iterating). Perhaps I just need help phrasing the question as surely someone has asked this, I just could not find it.  I apologize in advance if I missed an obvious reference or link.","['prime-numbers', 'formal-languages', 'number-theory']"
130114,how to understand the differential operator acting on functions that are not scalar,"Quite often these days I find myself in a situation where I'd like to understand differential operators. One bit that is particularly subtle to me at the moment is how a differential operator is to be understood when it is supposed to act on vector - valued, or matrix - valued functions. For example, suppose we are given a general linear partial differential operator
\begin{equation}
D = \sum_{|\alpha| \leq m} a_\alpha(x)\partial^\alpha
\end{equation} where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots \alpha_n)$ denotes a multi-index, $m$ is some positive integer, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\partial^\alpha := \partial^{|\alpha|}/(\partial^{\alpha_1} x_1 \dots \partial^{\alpha_n} x_n)$ denotes a mixed partial derivative, and the functions $a_\alpha$ are smooth. In various contexts they might be vector- or matrix valued. This is already where I am having difficulties, because usually it is assumed the reader knows how to apply these operators, and from this I guess one could deduce what kind of functions these $a_\alpha$ are .. How is such an operator supposed to act on vector - valued or matrix valued functions $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^k$ or $F: GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \to GL(k,\mathbb{R})$ ? Unfortunately my Calculus classes didn't cover much beyond the one - variable setting so I am shaky on these grounds. I am aware there are differential operators for non - scalar functions, such as div, curl, grad. All of these act in a specific way. But the operator above is none of these so I am a bit lost .. Sorry for being so confused about this - in case the question is unclear I am happy to try my best and improve the post, many thanks !","['multivariable-calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
130115,Branch Cut Issues,"I'm trying to evaluate what seems to be a straightforward contour integral: $$I=\int_{\gamma} \frac{dz}{\alpha + \beta z} $$ where $\gamma (t) = e^{-it}$, $t \in \left[ 0,\pi\right]$, $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$, and $|\alpha| \ne |\beta|$. Explicitly, $$I=\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{(-ie^{-it})dt}{\alpha + \beta e^{-it}}$$
$$=-i\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dt}{\alpha e^{it} + \beta }$$ I want to say that $$I=\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\log\left(\frac{\beta -\alpha}{\beta +\alpha}\right)-i \pi \right)$$ but I feel like I'm neglecting some subtle branch cut issues. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
