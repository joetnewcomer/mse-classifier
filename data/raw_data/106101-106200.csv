1505936,Convexity over a manifold,"First post on math.stackexchange! I have a question which probably requires a bit of Differential Geometry knowledge which I'm lacking. By definition a convex function over a vector space $V$ is such that $f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)$ for $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and $x, y \in V$. Two ways to check convexity are: Compute the Hessian and verify that it is positive semidefinite everywhere Check that $\frac{d^2 f(x+ty)}{dt^2}\mid_{t=0} \geq 0$ for all $x, y \in V$ Even though these two are equivalent, sometimes I feel it is a bit easier to use the second condition. Now, if we define convexity over a manifold similarly to $(1)$, i.e. the Hessian is positive semi-definite everywhere, then what a natural equivalent of $(2)$ would be? I guess some additional term will pop-up because of the curvature of the manifold? Or if we differentiate similarly along a geodesic would be fine? Just a reference would be enough, thanks.","['convex-analysis', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds']"
1505946,Primitive of an $L^1$ function is continuous,"The primitive of a continuous function on a compact interval is continuous via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  Let $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ be open and let $u': \overline{I} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  Then for any $y \in I$, by the $L^1-L^\infty$ bound from Holder's inequality, we have: \begin{equation}
|u(x)-u(y)|=\left|\int^x_y u'(z) \, dz \right| \leq \int^x_y \left| u'(z) \right| \, dz \leq \| u'\|_{L^{\infty}(\overline{I})} |x-y| \rightarrow 0 \quad \mbox{as } x \rightarrow y,
\end{equation}
so $u$ is continuous on $I$. The same argument can be used if $u' \in L^p(I)$ if $p \in (1,\infty]$.  However, I am unsure if it is still true if $u' \in L^1(I)$.  Can I still conclude that $u$ is continuous? Edit: fixing some errors in the question. Edit 2:
We use a different argument.  The idea is to truncate $u'$ on smaller and smaller supports so that the resulting sequence $u_n'$ will tend to $0$ in the limit.  The proof is concluded by the dominated convergence theorem (DCT) because $u_n' \leq u'$. Fix $y \in I$.  For each large positive integer $n$ (large enough of course so that $A_n \subset I$), let 
\begin{equation}
A_n:=\{t \in I: y-1/n<t<y+1/n \},
\end{equation}
and the indicator function
\begin{equation}
{\bf 1}_{A_n}(z):=
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
1 \quad \mbox{if } z \in A_n,\\
0 \quad \mbox{if } z \notin A_n.\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
Then $u'_n:={\bf 1}_{A_n}u'$ with $u'_n \rightarrow 0$ pointwise (a.e.) as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and $|u_n'| \leq u' \in L^1(I)$ by assumption.  Hence, the DCT implies that 
\begin{equation}
u(y+1/n)-u(y-1/n)\leq \int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz = \int_I |u_n'(z)| \, dz \rightarrow  \int_I 0 \, dz=0.
\end{equation}
That is, for each $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $n_0 > 0$ such that $n\geq n_0$ implies $\int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz < \varepsilon$.  Hence, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta:=1/n_0$ such that
\begin{equation}
|x-y| < \delta=1/n_0 \quad \mbox{implies} \quad |u(x)-u(y)|\leq  \int^{y+1/n}_{y-1/n} |u'(z)| \, dz<\varepsilon.
\end{equation} As Copperhat notes, this actually shows that $v << \mu$ where $v$ is a measure with density $u' \in L^1$ and $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.","['lp-spaces', 'lebesgue-integral', 'integration']"

1506416,Probability and measure theory,"I'd like to have a correct general understanding of the importance of measure theory in probability theory. For now, it seems like mathematicians work with the notion of probability measure and prove theorems, because it automacially makes the theorem true, no matter if we work with discrete and continuous probability distribution.

1506719,measurable functions. Why defined like this?,"Let us have measurable spaces $(S_1, \Sigma_1)$ and $(S_2, \Sigma_2)$. 
Idea of measurable function $f$ with respect to $\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2$ is the following. $f:$ $S_1 \to S_2$ has to be such that:
$$\forall E_2: f^{-1}(E_2) \in \Sigma_1, $$ 
where 
$ E_2 \subset \Sigma_2, E_1 \subset \Sigma_1 $. Another author looks for elements of $S_1$, lets say $x$, and says that function $f$ is measurable if:
$$\{x: f(x) \in E_2 \} \in \Sigma_1 $$ My question is:
WHY we have: $f$ from the $S_1 \to S_2$ but not $f$ from the $E_1 \to E_2$!? Or, if we wish to travel from sets, then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ will be from the $S_2 \to S_1$. I made a sketch of the 1st definition of this measurable function, and my picture does not seems to be coherent with what I naturally want to find. I mean for me it would be natural to 
  define that $f^{-1}$ goes back
  the same route from which it started ($S_2 \to S_1$). wikipedia and few books I have been reading does not shed light on this topic except what is unclear for me. Other googling did not help either. thank you. UPDATE Thank you all very much. All three answers complement each other and give me a wider picture of what to think about. I was thinking the hole day, and will after a while, but I have troubles and many ideas still somehow mix in the head. To summarize. The first take home message I got: 1) From simple calculus. We build image and preimage functions firstly on elements of some set. Then we have something like a function on sets. 2) There is no restrictions ( inverse exist, or it is injective, surjective or bijective function) for measurable function $f$. 3) There was a great insight why exactly preimage is what we have to use in building the mapping. But I agree it somewhere in my heart, and still try to make it more understandable to brain and I fail. I will post below more text about what I understand and what I do not. 4) What about second definiton where we have just image. I mean, are these definitions equal? It does not use preimage function. 5) I am also trying to find analogue in Probability Theory, where we have measurable space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$, measurable function(r.v.) $X$ that makes mapping  $X: \Omega \to \mathcal{R}$, where $(\mathcal{R},\sigma(\mathcal{R}))$ is another measurable space. My question here is the following. 
Let $w \in \Omega, X(w) \to r$ where $r \in \mathcal{R}$.
$X^{-1}(r) = w$. 
Here we do not use correspondence of subsets of sigma algebras. Am I right? I omitted which r and w should be because I think I can write something stupid=) 6)And to conclude. The general problem/question for me was and remains, that I still try to imagine in my head that we should have for a measurable function some kind of correspondence of image and preimage, but this is not enough(or other reason stated) as I read from answers. 
Maybe there is possible to do example/picture to answer the question of the reason of function (image) to be from set X to set Y,  while the preimage function may work not necessary with the same “matter”, in our case some subsets of sigma algebras, that are generated by initial sets (or shortly part of my question is: why measurable function is not an inversion function that maps from same sets X and Y?). Am I right that this definition of measurable function ( $\forall E_2: f^{-1}(E_2) \in \Sigma_1, $) allows for certain sets $E_1$ to have no correspondence with all the subsets of sigma algebra $\Sigma_2$? If yes, this is the point where $f$ may have mapping from $E_1$  to a an empty set $\emptyset$? FIN1. Is such a mnemonics mathematically correct: Function $f$ that is an image of set $X$ to set $Y$ (here I mean image of every element $x$ of $X$ to elements $y$ of $Y$) is measurable, if 
for any subset generated by $\sigma(Y)$ we have a preimage that is inside a $\sigma(X)$. FIN2.And again, For every function $f$, subset $A$ of the domain and subset $B$ of the
  codomain we have $A \subset f^{−1}(f(A))$ and $f(f^{−1}(B)) \subset B$. If $f$ is injective we have $A = f^{−1}(f(A))$ and if ''f'' is
  surjective we have $f(f^{−1}(B)) = B$. So, in order to understand this better I wanted at least to show myself visually that this holds. I have included picture of my thoughts which give me completely opposite result. Should I post this as separate question?",['measure-theory']
1506721,Help with understanding point from Kahneman's book “Thinking Fast and Slow”,"My question: How did Kahneman arrive at the 60% number in the last sentence (""60% of the pairs"")?

A very generous estimate of the correlation between the success of the

  30% overlap. To appreciate the significance of this number, consider
  the following question: Suppose you consider many pairs of firms. The two firms in each pair
  are generally similar, but the CEO of one of them is better than the
  other. How often will you find that the firm with the stronger CEO is
  the more successful of the two? In a well-ordered and predictable world, the correlation would be
  perfect, and the stronger CEO would be found to lead the more
  successful firm in 100% of the pairs. If the relative success of
  similar firms was determined entirely by factors that the CEO does not
  control (call them luck, if you wish), you would find the more
  successful firm led by the weaker CEO 50% of the time. A correlation
  of .30 implies that you would find the stronger CEO leading the
  stronger firm in about 60% of the pairs—an improvement of a mere 10
  percentage points over random guessing, hardly grist for the hero

1507046,Solving particular type of system of equations in $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$,"I apologize in advance for the long post. You can freely skip to the last paragraph. I was motivated by this question given in 5th grade mathematics competition that I was solving with my advanced students: Three satellites are orbiting the Earth. The first one circles around the Earth in $75$ minutes, the second one in $105$ minutes and the third one in $135$ minutes. How much time is needed, counting from the moment they simultaneously passed over South Pole, to meet again at the same spot. Now, obviously, the answer is $\operatorname{lcm}(75,105,135) = 4725$. Let us now assume the orbits are coplanar and we are trying to determine when the satellites are going to first align. Like in previous example let us assume they start at the same point and assume uniform circular motion. 
It seems natural to work inside $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$, and convert time to frequency. So, we need to find the smallest $T\in\mathbb R_{>0}$ such that $$f_1T +\mathbb Z = f_2T +\mathbb Z =\ldots =f_nT + \mathbb Z\tag{1}$$ This is equivalent to finding the smallest $T\in\mathbb R_{>0}$ such that $$(f_k - f_1)T\in\mathbb Z,\quad\forall k=2,3,\ldots,n$$ or even more conveniently, equivalent to finding integers $m_k\neq 0$ such that
$$\frac{m_2}{f_2 - f_1} = \frac{m_3}{f_3 - f_1} = \ldots = \frac{m_n}{f_n - f_1}\tag{2}$$ This is pretty nice as it will lead to computing $T$. But, before I continue, let me also note that now we have that $T$ is the generator of $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k=2}^n \frac 1{f_k-f_1}\mathbb Z.$ This is not surprising at all, actually, as satellites $1$ and $k$ will meet (align) exactly at times $$T = \frac m{f_k-f_1},\, m\in\mathbb Z$$ so above intersection will exactly correspond to the times all satellites meet simultaneously. Returning to $(2)$, we can conclude that $$\frac{f_k-f_1}{f_2-f_1}=\frac{m_k}{m_2}\in\mathbb Q,\quad\forall k = 2,\ldots,n$$ Thus, $(2)$ can be solved if and only if $$\frac{f_k-f_1}{f_2-f_1}\in\mathbb Q,\quad\forall k = 2,\ldots,n\tag{3}$$ This actually gives us computational method, as I mentioned earlier: 1) Calculate $\frac{f_k-f_1}{f_2-f_1} = \frac {a_k}{b_k}$ for all $k$, where $a_k$ and $b_k$ are relatively prime. 2) Set $T = \frac{l}{f_2 - f_1}$, where $l = \operatorname{lcm}(b_3,\ldots,b_n)$ This works because we have
$$\frac{1}{f_2 - f_1} = \frac{\frac{a_3}{b_3}}{f_3 - f_1} = \ldots = \frac{\frac{a_n}{b_n}}{f_n - f_1}\implies \frac{l}{f_2 - f_1} = \frac{m_3}{f_3 - f_1} = \ldots = \frac{m_n}{f_n - f_1}$$ where $m_k = l\frac{a_k}{b_k},\, k>2$, and such $T$ is really the smallest because $m_3,\ldots,m_n$ are relatively prime. Also, note that we have nice necessary condition to have a solution in the first place: $$\frac{f_k-f_1}{f_2-f_1} = q_k \implies f_k = (1-q_k)f_1 + q_kf_2\implies f_k\in\mathbb Q(f_1,f_2),\quad k >2$$ so we can immediately conclude that, for example, satellites with frequencies $$f_1 = 1,\ f_2=\sqrt 2,\ f_3=\sqrt 3$$ will never simultaneously meet after starting from the same point. I was positively surprised that such a problem (in physics?) can be completely characterized (and computed) algebraically. I tried to generalize this to the problem when satellites do not necessarily start at the same point, but had no luck. So, after the long introduction, my question is: For fixed positive constants $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ (such that $f_i\neq f_j$ for $i\neq j$) and $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$, can we find $T\in\mathbb R_{>0}$ such that $$f_1T + \alpha_1 + \mathbb Z = f_2T + \alpha_2 + \mathbb Z = \ldots = f_nT + \alpha_n + \mathbb Z$$ in general or at least find necessary conditions for existence? Examples: 1) For $n=2$ and $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 0$ $$fT + \mathbb Z = gT+\mathbb Z$$ has solutions $T = \frac m{f-g}$ for any $m\in\mathbb Z$. 2) For $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = 0$ and $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = \sqrt 2$, $f_3 = \sqrt 3$ there are no solutions to $$T+\mathbb Z = T\sqrt 2+\mathbb Z = T\sqrt 3+\mathbb Z$$ as previously noted. 3) Another example might be $$T + \mathbb Z = T\sqrt 2 +\sqrt 3+\mathbb Z = T\sqrt 3 +\frac 1 2+\mathbb Z$$ This kind of system interests me most, as (I think) I have solved the problem for trivial $\alpha$'s.

1507078,A binary sequence graph,"Define a graph $H(n, 2)$ as follows. Each vertex corresponds to a
  length $n$ binary sequence and two vertices are adjacent if and only if
  they differ in exactly two positions. I want to find three things. (1) The number of vertices (2) The degree of each vertex in this graph (3) The number of connected components of this graph. For (1) is really easy, It is just $2^n$ for example, if we have $n=2$ then we would have four vertices which are $$00$$
$$01$$
$$10$$
$$11$$ and for $n=3$ we would have $2^3$ and so on, so in general we would have $2^n$ vertices. For (2) it's a bit tricky, We know that each binary sequence is adjacent to another binary sequence that differs in exactly two position so if we have $n=3$ then $$ 000 \longrightarrow 011,110,101 $$
and if we have $n=4$ then $$0000 \longrightarrow 0011,1100,0110,1001,1010,0101$$ and so in general it's $${n \choose 2}$$ Now I have a lot of troubles with (3), How can I find the number of connected components of this graph. I tried to see it visually with small numbers of $n=2$ an for $n=3$ we would have two connected components and also the same thing when $n=3$ we would also have two connected components , this makes me thing that in general for any $n$ we would have two connected components But my question is why, I couldn't come up with an argument here.","['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'combinations', 'connectedness', 'combinatorics']"

I use the following. Definition 2.2.1 (Addition of natural numbers). Let $m$ be a natural number. To add zero to $m$ , we define $0 + m := m$ . Now suppose inductively that we have defined how to add $n$ to $m$ . Then we can add $n{+\!+}$ to $m$ by defining $(n{+\!+}) + m := (n + m){+\!+}$ . Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation law). Let $a, b, c$ be natural numbers such that $a + b = a + c$ . Then we have $b = c$ . Axiom 2.4 . Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if $n, m$ are natural numbers and $n \neq m$ , then $n{+\!+} \neq m{+\!+}$ . Equivalently, if $n{+\!+} = m{+\!+}$ , then we must have $n = m$ . Tao suggested the use of induction, so I am doubting the validity of my proof. Proof:
Proceed by contradiction. Let us assume we have $2$ differing natural numbers $b$ and $c$ , such that $b{+\!+} = a$ and $c{+\!+} = a$ . 
Then we have $b{+\!+} = 0 + b{+\!+}$ and $c{+\!+} = 0 + c{+\!+}$ (definition of addition).
So we then have that $0 + b{+\!+} = 0 + c{+\!+}$ , but then $b{+\!+} = c{+\!+}$ (Cancellation Law). This is a contradiction due to Axiom 2.4 . I am self-studying real analysis, so I want to ensure that I am proceeding correctly.","['real-analysis', 'elementary-number-theory']"

integers. $\frac{2n+1}{n+1}=f(n)$ is increasing for $n>0$ and is bounded by horizontal asymptote  $y=2$. Thus if $f(n)$ was an integer larger than $0$ it could only be $1$. This would imply $n=0$ which does not satisfy our bound on $n$. Thus for $n$ an integer larger than $0$: $\frac{2n+1}{n+1}$ is not an integer.

1507474,"Why use a particular regularization for $\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,e^{i p x}$?","There are many badly defined integrals in physics.
I want to discuss one of them which I see very often. 
$$\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,e^{i p x}$$
I have seen this integral in many physical problems. Many people(physicists) seem to think it is a well defined integral, and is calculated as follows: We will use regularization (we introduce a small real parameter $\varepsilon$ and after calculation set $\varepsilon = 0$. $$I_0=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,e^{i p x}e^{ -\varepsilon x}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon-i p}=\frac{i}{p}$$ But I can obtain an arbitrary value for this integral!
I will use regularization too, but I will use another parametrization: $$I(\alpha)=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,e^{i p x}=\int_0^\infty dx \left(1+\alpha\frac{\varepsilon \sin px}{p}\right)e^{i p x}e^{ -\varepsilon x}$$
where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter and $\alpha$ is an arbitrary value
using $\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,\sin{(\alpha x)} e^{ -\beta x}=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha^2+\beta^2}$ After a not-so-difficult calculation I obtain that
$I(\alpha)=\frac{i}{p}\left(1+\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)$. This integral I have often seen in intermediate calculation. But usually people do not take into account of this problem, and just use $I_0$. I don't understand why? I know only one example when I can explain why we should use $I_0$. In field theory when we calculate $U(-\infty,0)$, where $U$ is an evolution operator, It is proportional to $\int^0_{-\infty} \mathrm{d}t\,e^{ -iE t}$. It is necessary for the Weizsaecker-Williams approximation in QED, or the DGLAP equation in QCD, because in axiomatic QFT we set $T\to \infty(1-i\varepsilon)$. My question is: Why, in calculation of the integral $\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x\,e^{i p x}$, do people use $I_0$? Why people use $e^{ -\varepsilon x}$ regularization function? In my point of view this regularization no better and no worse than another.","['physics', 'mathematical-physics', 'integration']"

1507534,Prove that $\mathbb{Z}[i]/\langle 1+i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Quotient ring of Gaussian integers (7 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Prove that: $\mathbb{Z}[i]/\langle 1+i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. This is my first time using the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings and I am looking for feedback for whether some steps in this proof could have been done better. From my understanding, I need to: Define a surjective homomorphism $\phi$ between $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Show that $\ker(\phi) = \langle 1+i \rangle$. Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z}[i] \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ by $\phi(a+bi)=[a+b]_2$. $\boldsymbol {\phi}  \textbf{ is surjective:}$ Given $a+bi$, we have $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. So take $b$ to be $0$, then we have $\phi (a+0i)=[a]_2$, and clearly we can get $0$ and $1$. $\boldsymbol{\phi} \textbf{ is a homomorphism:} $ $$\begin{align} \phi((a+bi)+(c+di)) &=\phi((a+c)+(b+d)i) \\ &=[(a+c)+(b+d)]_2+[c+d]_2 \\ &=[(a+b)+(c+d)]_2 \\ & =[a+b]_2+[c+d]_2 \\ &= \phi(a+bi)+\phi(c+di).\end{align}$$ $$\begin{align} \phi((a+bi)(c+di)) &= \phi((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i) \\ &=[(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)]_2 \\ &=[(ac+bd)+(ad+bc)]_2 \\ &=[(a+b)(c+d)]_2 \\ &=[a+b]_2[c+d]_2 \\ &=\phi(a+bi)\phi(c+di). \end{align}$$ $\boldsymbol{\ker(\phi)=\langle 1+i \rangle}$: We have that $\ker(\phi) = \{ (a+bi) \in \mathbb{Z}[i]: \phi(a+bi) =[a+b]_2 =[0]_2\}$. From my understanding, elements in $\langle 1+i \rangle$ are just of the type $(1+i)(c+di)$ where $c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$. I've tried to show that one is a subset of the other. Another idea I have is in noting that $[a+b]_2=[0]_2 \iff 2|(a+b)-0$ and somehow link it to showing that these are the same elements in $\langle 1+i \rangle$, but I could not do it.

1507567,Sylow's theorems for Symmetric Group and Finite Groups,"There are several proofs of Sylow's three theorems. Historically, Cauchy first proved that if the order of a symmetric group $S_n$ is $p^aq$ ($p$ is prime, and $q$ is relatively prime to $p$), then $S_n$ has a subgroup of order $p^a$ . Using this theorem , it can be shown every finite group possesses a Sylow-$p$ subgroup ( see this ). This shows that Sylow's first theorem for arbitrary finite group can be deduced from Sylow's first theorem for Symmetric group. Question 1. Are there independent proofs of Sylow's second and third theorems for Symmetric groups, which do not use arguments for general finite group? Question 2. Can we prove Sylow's second and third theorem for arbitrary group with the information that they are being proved for symmetric groups.","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'symmetric-groups']"

By definition, a function is differentiable if the following limit exists and is finite
$$\lim _{\Delta z \to0 }\frac{f\left ( z+\Delta z \right )-f\left ( z \right )}{\Delta z}.$$ Along the x-axis I got something like $f^{'}\left ( z \right )=3x^{2}+3x$(it's important that it exists). Similar analysis holds for the y-axis. The Cauchy-Riemann equations yield the following system :
$$x^{2}+y^{2}=y^{2}+x^{2}$$
$$xy=-xy$$
That means the the necessary conditions are met only along the lines $x=0$ or $y=0$. The partials of $u$ and $v$ are elementary functions and as such are continuous on their whole domain(which includes the axes).  I have, thus proven that the function IS differentiable along the axes, which is contrary to the problem's statement. This seemed a bit odd, so I tried doing this analysis by definition, namely, after proving differentiability(the difference between analyticity and differentiabilty is subtle) I used the following two definitions: Definition 1. A function is analytic in a point if it is differentiable in SOME neighborhood of that point. This obviously holds true for every point on the axes. Definition 2.  A function is analytic in some region if it is analytic in every point of that region. This intuitively also holds true. One point where this might break down is the fact that the axes might not even be considered regions(which are open here, in the topological sense.). By all definitions I have read and searched for, a line is to be considered an open region.

Here is how I have attempted it thus far: Assume we have $f:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ which is continuous on its domain and differentiable at $x_0 \in (a,b)$. Then, we know $lim_{x \to x_0}\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}=L$ or, in other words, that our limit at $x_0$ exists. We wish to show that $g:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on its domain. Since $f$ is continuous by assumption and, clearly, $x-x_0$ is continuous the only point we need concern ourselves with is $x_0$. Everywhere else we have the difference and quotient of continuous functions where the denominator is non-zero which is also continuous. Since $g(x_0)=f'(x)$ by definition we select $\delta>0$ such that $|x-x_0|<\delta$ and given $\varepsilon>0$ we have $\left|\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}-f'(x)\right|=0<\varepsilon$ I am unsure of how to pick our $\delta$ but I am fairly certain all the ideas here are correct.

In general, For a face with $n >3$ edges, We can add $n-3$ edges to divide it into triangles. If there exists a face with less than three edges , then we just have maybe two edges ( THIS IS NOT EVEN A FACE ?).

$$\tau_{x} = inf \{ t \geq 0; |W_t| = x\}$$ Compute $E[e^{-s\tau_x}]$ and prove that $\tau_x$ is equal in distribution to $x^2\tau_{1}$. I would like some hint to get started. I am unsure how to prove equality in distribution. To compute the expectation, I believe I need to first determine the distribution of $\tau_x$. I believe this is very complicated. Attempt: To avoid cumbersome notation, I will let $\tau = \tau_{x}$ for some $x>0$. Consider exponential martingale $Z_t = e^{\lambda W_t - \lambda ^2t/2 } + e^{-\lambda W_t - \lambda ^2t/2}$. By optional sampling theorem, 
$E[Z_0] = E[Z_{\tau}]$. Hence, $$2 = E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2}(e^{\lambda W_{\tau}} + e^{-\lambda W_{\tau} })] = E[E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2}(e^{\lambda W_{\tau}} + e^{-\lambda W_{\tau} })|\tau]] = E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2}E[(e^{\lambda W_{\tau}} + e^{-\lambda W_{\tau} })|\tau]]$$ By a symmetrical argument for fixed $\tau$, we have that:
$$E[e^{\lambda W_{\tau}} + e^{-\lambda W_{\tau} }|\tau ] = 0.5 (e^{\lambda x} + e^{-\lambda x}) + 0.5 (e^{\lambda (-x)} + e^{-\lambda (-x)}) = e^{\lambda x} + e^{-\lambda x}$$
Combining, 
$$2= E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2} (e^{\lambda x} + e^{-\lambda x})]= (e^{\lambda x} + e^{-\lambda x})E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2}]$$ So, 
$$E[e^{- \lambda ^2 \tau /2}] = \dfrac{2}{(e^{\lambda x} + e^{-\lambda x})}$$ And let $s=\lambda^2/2$ to find that:
$$E[e^{- s \tau}] = \dfrac{2}{(e^{\sqrt{2s}x} + e^{-\sqrt{2s}x})}$$ Reverting to original notation, we have proved $\forall x>0$ that
