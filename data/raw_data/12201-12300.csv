95050,"Is an equilateral triangle the same as an equiangular triangle, in any geometry?","I have heard of both equilateral triangles and equiangular triangles . (For example, this sporcle quiz lists both.) Are these always equivalent, regardless of geometry? I know they are the same in Euclidean geometry (a triangle that is equilateral has three 60 degree angles), but how about elliptic or hyperbolic ?  Or geometries without constant curvature ? In elliptic and hyperbolic geometry, I believe an equilateral triangle is uniquely determined up to congruence by one of its angles, but I'm not sure of the proof. If the conditions are equivalent for triangles, are there two words because they are also used to describe equilateral / equiangular polygons, which are not always the same?  For example, a rectangle is equiangular but need not be equilateral, and a rhombus is equilateral but need not be equiangular.  What's so special about triangles?  (or tetrahedra?)","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'geometry', 'triangles', 'spherical-geometry']"

95115,Probability and the Collatz Problem,"A long time ago I was messing around with the Collatz problem and I stumbled across a “proof” that the iterations will converge. I was too embarrassed to show anyone, and I recently just remembered it. So I will put a sketch of it here and I want to know where it falls down.
Define $C(n)$ as one iteration of the Collatz function on a positive integer $n$ .
Assume we start at a random positive even integer $n$ .
Define the probability that $C(n)$ is even by $P(C(n)\in \text{even})$ , or just $P(C(n))$ .
For a random start number $P(C(n))=0.5$ . (remember that $n$ is even) But $P(C^{2}(n))=1/2\times P((C(n))+ (1-P(C(n)))$ . (By simple probability tree) And so on, in general $P(C^{k}(n))=1/2\times P(C^{k-1}(n))+(1-P(C^{k-1}(n)))=1-1/2\times P(C^{k-1}(n))$ Which gives us a geometric progression (with multiple -1/2) as we work our way back into terms of $P(C(n))$ . As $k \to \infty $ , $P(C^{k}(n))\to \frac{1}{1-(-1/2)}=2/3$ . So what? Well, this implies that as k gets bigger our iterations will settle down to something like an even-even-odd cycle (2/3 are even). Assume that on $k$ iterations of the Collatz function, we end up at a larger number than our initial number. This implies (assuming w.l.o.g. we have an even number, $x$ ) $3\times \frac{x}{4}+1$ is greater than $x$ .
Or, $x<4$ . But we have checked for all numbers less than four and the Collatz function converges, so there is no number that will diverge. I know this is a very sketchy sketch of a “proof”. I just want to know what you think. If it is nonsense please say so. Edit: I also tried a different Collatz-style iterations, with $3x-1$ instead of $3x+1$ . As far qs it is observable this doesn’t seem to converge. Using the same arguments as my original question, we can see why. $3\times \frac{x}{4}-1$ is greater than $x$ when $x<-4$ . I also tried similar other changes using $3x+a$ for $a\in \{3,5,7,\ldots\}$ . If the iterations converge for all integers less than $4\times a$ then it is convergent for all (assuming my “proof” makes sense). Second Edit: I want to reply to some issues raised. Bare in mind this is not a formal proof, it’s just an idea of a way of making a proof. On the objection that, just because on average the iterations will yield a 2/3 chance of an even number, there may in fact be sequences that do not reduce to an even-even-odd sequence: If a particular sequence doesn’t end in a 2/3 chance of an even number, and in fact it contains more odd numbers, then (now I’m not sure how to say this mathematically) that sequence is as dense in the integers as the sequences that cycle to 1-4-2, as for any even number in the sequence there is an infinite number of even numbers that also join this sequence (i.e., just double any even number in the sequence again and again…). Therefore, since the average sequence ends in a 2/3 chance of an even number after $k\to \infty$ iterations, there must be a sequence that has a higher-thanh2/3 chance of yielding an even number. I cannot prove it yet but I think, just on considering it, that such a sequence cannot exist, because: as the sequence progresses the numbers would get smaller and smaller (e.g., if the prob of an even number is 3/4, then we can consider a even-even-even-odd sequence, which is the same as a even-even-odd sequence but with an extra division by two, so it would necessarily be smaller than the starting number. Meaning (a) it couldn’t cycle (b) it couldn’t diverge to infinity. i.e., it is impossible. (B.t.w., the above type of proof I’m trying to make is based on a type of proof I forget the name of - if the average of something is $x$ , but you can find something with a value less than $x$ , then there must exist an object with a value greater than $x$ .) On the objection that I am abusing the term probability and that this is akin to saying “there are no primes, because as we get to bigger and bigger numbers the probability of a certain number being prime approaches zero”: I think that, although I haven’t defined how I’m using probability axioms, I think saying $C(n)$ can either be even or odd, and given an arbitrary $n$ it is possible to talk about the probability of it being even. If $C(n)$ is even, then $C(n+2)$ is odd so it doesn’t matter where you are in the integers, the probability is always 1/2. I’m not sure why this is controversial.","['collatz-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

95131,Splitting field implies Galois extension,"I hope this isn't too elementary of a question, but I'm not sure I understand Artin's proof that if $K/F$ is a finite extension, then $K/F$ Galois is equivalent to $K$ being a splitting field over $F$ (this is Theorem 16.6.4 in the second edition). We're working in characteristic zero here. I understand one direction, that Galois implies splitting field: if we let $\gamma_{1}$ generate $K/F$ and $f$ be its minimal polynomial of degree $n$ , each automorphism of $K/F$ comes from sending $\gamma_{1}$ to another root of $f$ , and in order for $\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)$ to have order $n$ we need all of the roots of $f$ to be in $K$ . However, I still am not seeing the other direction - after stating the above Artin seems to finish by saying that if we define $\gamma_{1},f$ as before, "" $K$ is a splitting field over $F$ iff $f$ splits completely in $K$ ."" But isn't it possible that $f$ doesn't split, but $K$ is the splitting field of some other polynomial?","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

95213,Branch point-what makes a closed loop around it special?,"I am having difficulty understanding the concept of a branch point of a multifunction.
It is typically explained as follows:branch point is a point such that the function is discontinuous when going around an arbitrarily small circuit around this point.
What I am unable to understand is what is special about the set of points encircling this particular point?
If I have a closed loop somewhere in the plane, the function is not multivalued on this loop. But if I translate this to enclose this point, then the function becomes multivalued. Why?
I initially thought it might be because if this branch point is my reference point then as I run over the loop I am running over the values 0 to 2 $\pi$ . But if I move my reference point to somewhere inside the loop this still remains true over any closed loop.

95236,partial sum involving factorials,"Here is an interesting series I ran across.

This works out the same as $\displaystyle 2^{n}\prod_{k=1}^{n}2k=2^{n}\cdot 2^{n}\cdot n!=4^{n}\cdot n!$ I tried equating these somehow, but I could not get it. I even wrote out the series.

I know the answer is much lower, because you can't have a board filled entirely of back marbles (players use black and white marbles; the equivalent of X and O in tic-tac-toe).

Let $M$ be a $k$-dimension manifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $f:W\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a coordinate system around $x=f(a)$, where $W$ is some open subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$. We know $f'(a)$ has rank $k$, by definition), so the linear transformation $f_*:\mathbb{R}^k_a\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n_x$ is 1-1, and the image $f(\mathbb{R}^k_a)$ is $k$-dimensional. If $g:V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is another coordinate system, with $x=g(b)$. Spviak claims: $$g_*(\mathbb{R}^K_b) = f_*(f^{-1}\circ g)_*(\mathbb{R}^K_b) = f_*(\mathbb{R}^K_a)$$ I realize the chain rule is being used, but I am having trouble following the implications. In particular: 1) I think the chain rule gives the first implication, but I don't see why we can take the derivative of $f^{-1}$, because it is a map between spaces of different dimensions (so the inverse function theorem doesn't apply). 2) The last equality implies that $(f^{-1}\circ g)'$ is the identity.

This is a generalisation of a Latin (or even semi-Latin) square, which obviously has this property.  It is a proper generalisation, as there are tableaux with this property that are not semi-Latin, such as $$\left[\begin{matrix} 1&2&2\\3&1&3\\3&1&2\end{matrix}\right].$$  I have counted the number of such tableaux, up to a suitable (for my applications) notion of isomorphism for $n = 2,3,4$, and there are lots of them.  There are $5$ with $n = 2$; $305$ with $n = 3$; and $2630904$, with $n = 4$.  As these generalise Latin squares, it seems like the sort of thing that people in the combinatorics community might have investigated.  Have such tableaux been studied before?  Do they have a name?  (If these have a name, I might do better with Google.)  Many thanks. EDIT:  For the $2\times 2$ case, there are $6 = {4\choose 2}$ squares, since we can choose any two of the four matrix positions in which to place a $1$, and then the other two spots must contain a $2$.  These are:

I'm going to post an example question with the proof I came up with and the proof given by the book. If possible, could you comment on how my proof is insufficient to prove the result, because I don't understand why it isn't. I understand the definition of the limit of a function to be the following: $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ means, $\forall \epsilon >0, \exists \delta >0; 0 < |x-a|< \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L|< \epsilon$, with $x, a, L \in \mathbb{R}$. Question: Give an $\epsilon$-$\delta$ proof that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 2} x^3 =8$. My Proof: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary and for $\delta = (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3} -2$ assume that $ 0 < |x-2| < \delta$, with $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, 
  $$|x-2| < (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3} -2$$
  $$x-2 < (\epsilon + 8)^\frac{1}{3} -2 $$
  $$x< (\epsilon +8)^\frac{1}{3}$$
  $$x^3 < \epsilon +8$$
  $$x^3 - 8 < \epsilon$$
  $$|x^3 - 8| < \epsilon$$
  Therefore, for $f(x) = x^3$ and $L = 8$, we have shown $|f(x) -L| < \epsilon$ and resultantly $\lim_{n \rightarrow 2} x^3 = 8$. Book's Proof: Let $\epsilon >0$ be given and choose $\delta = \min(1, \frac{\epsilon}{19})$. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 < |x-2| < \delta = \min(1,\frac{\epsilon}{19})$. Since $|x-2|<1$, it follows that $ -1 < x-2 < 1$ and so $1 <x<3$. Thus $|x^2 + 2x +4| < 19$. Because $|x-2| < \frac{\epsilon}{19}$, it follows that $|x^3 - 8| = |x-2||x^2 + 2x +4| < 19|x-2|< 19(\frac{\epsilon}{19})=\epsilon$. Aren't we trying to show that given our assumption that $0 < |x-a|< \delta$ we need to show that $|f(x) - L|< \epsilon$. That is all that is required right? We pick some $\delta$ for which this works? I'm able to follow to proof in the book and understand that it is correct, I just don't understand why all of the additional details are necessary.

(Or differently formulated: What do to if set set I want to describe contains arbitrary many disjunction symbols ?) Long  version : Given a set $I$ and for every $i\in I$ a topological space $(X_i,\tau _i)$, then one can endow $\prod X_i $ with a topology by specifying  a set $$\mathcal{S}=\{\prod Y_i \ |\  \exists j\in I \ \ \forall i \in I\setminus \{j\}: Y_i=X_i \textrm{ and } Y_j\in \tau _j\}.$$
Then there is only one topology, the product topology, for which this set is a subbase. To obtain the open sets in this topology, one has to go through the following process: One first has to intersect the elements from $S$ finitely many times - then one has obtained a base, $\mathcal{B}$, for the topology - and then one has to form arbitrary unions of the set in the base. $ \ $ Let's warm up - I can describe the an element to be in $\mathcal{S}$ either by its construction, meaning it satisfies: $S\in \mathcal{S} \Leftrightarrow \exists j\in I \ \ \exists O\in \tau_j \ \ \forall i \in I\setminus \{j\}: Y_i=X_i \textrm{ and } Y_j=O,$ or if it is of the form $S=\{f:I\rightarrow \cup_{i\in I} X_i \ | \ \exists i\in I \ \ \exists O\in \tau_i: f(i)\in O  \}.$ $ \ $ The same (only a bit more tedious to write out) goes for $\mathcal{B}$: $B\in \mathcal{B}  \Leftrightarrow  \exists J, \ J \textrm{ finite set, such that } B=\cap_{j\in J} S_j $ with $S_j\in S,$ or in set-builder notation: $B = \{  f:I\rightarrow \cup_{i\in I} X_i \ | \ \exists n\in \mathbb{N} \ \ \exists i_1,\ldots,i_n \in I \ \ \exists O_{i_1}\in T_{i_1},\ldots,O_{i_n}\in T_{i_n} $ such that $f(i_1)\in O_{i_1} \land ,\ldots, \land f(i_n)\in O_{i_n} \}. $ $ \ $ But if I want to describe an open set like above, I can only describe it via its contruction: $O\in \mathcal{O}  \Leftrightarrow  \exists F, F \textrm{ arbitrary set},\  \ \exists J, \ J \textrm{ finite set, such that } O=\cup_{f \in F} \, \cap_{j\in J} S_{fj} $ with $S_{fj}\in S$. If I wanted to describe it in set-builder notation I would have to have use infinitely many disjunction symbols. 
To exemplify this, see the following: Since an union of, lets say two base sets, $B_1\cup B_2$, can be written in set-builder notation as - this gets nasty - $B_1\cup B_2= \{  f:I\rightarrow \cup_{i\in I} X_i \ | \ \  \exists n_1,n_2 \in \mathbb{N} \ \ \exists i_{1,n_1},\ldots ,i_{n_1,n_1}\in I, \ \  [\ldots ]$

It lets me the ability to treat lots of objects I would not otherwise feel comfortable with as if they were modules over some ring; in essence, I feel like I've gained some tools from it. However, I simply cannot see where to apply the Yoneda lemma to some useful end. This is not to say that I don't think it is a very pretty lemma, which I do, or that I do not appreciate the aesthetic of being able to study an object in a category by looking at the morphisms from that object, which I also do. And I do find it useful to consider the modules over a ring rather than the ring itself when studying that ring, or to treat groups as subgroups of permutation groups, which are the two applications I've heard of the Yoneda lemma. The problem is that I already knew these things could be done. Essentially, I don't feel like I've gained any tools from the Yoneda lemma.

I want to prove that $H$ is the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $G$. I think we should use this fact: if $N$ is normal in $G$ of cardinality 2 then $N<Z(G)$. This is what I have done: $H$ is normal because of index 2. Take a subgroup $K$ normal, proper and non trivial. $K$ cannot be contained properly in $H$ because $H$ is simple. If I prove that $H\subseteq K$ then $|G/K||K/H|=|G/H|=2$ and so $K=H$. So I want to prove that $H\subseteq K$. Now, $H\cap K\trianglelefteq H$ and $H$ is simple then we have $H\cap K=\{e\}$ or $H\cap K=H$ and so $H\subseteq K$. So I suppose that $H\cap K=\{e\}$ and I want to reach a contradiction.
