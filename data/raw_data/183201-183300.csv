3349594,Are the definite and indefinite integrals actually two different things? Where is the flaw in my understanding?,"Some context: I'm an engineer, and I tend to have a rather unusual way of understanding and thinking about things, most likely related to my being autistic. I found this question on the HNQ and upon reading it I felt rather confused. I have always understood that the indefinite and definite integrals are two sides of the same underlying concept, that there is no meaningful difference between them other than that one evaluates to a function and the other to a quantity. Essentially, the definite integral is what you get from running the numbers on the result of an indefinite integral, and saying it's unrelated to the definite integral is like saying that $\sin(x)$ is fundamentally different from $\sin(a)$ , assuming $x$ is a variable and $a$ a constant, for no reason other than that $x$ is a variable and $a$ a constant. To me, whether the definite and indefinite integrals are two sides of the same thing, or two closely related but different things, seems more like a question of philosophy than mathematics. Where is the flaw in my understanding? Is there one?","['integration', 'calculus', 'terminology']"

I'll restate some definitions . . . For positive integers $m,n$ with $m\le n$ , let $P(m,n)$ be the number of $n$ -tuples with each component in $\{1,...,m\}$ such that each of the values $\;1,...,m\;$ occurs at least once. For example, for $n=4$ , we have $P(1,4)=1,\,P(2,4)=14,\,P(3,4)=36,\,P(4,4)=24$ . For each positive integer $n$ , let $f(n)$ be the least positive integer $m\le n$ such that $P(m,n)$ is as large as possible. The data obtained so far supports the following conjecture: Claim: $\;$ If $n$ is a multiple of $4$ , then $f(n)={\large{\frac{3}{4}}}n$ . Can anyone prove or disprove this claim? Update # $1$ : $\;$ The claim fails for $n=32$ . Which suggests that I should ask for asymptotic results rather than exact values. Here's the revised question: Question: $\;$ Does ${\displaystyle{\lim_{n\to\infty}}}{\large{\frac{f(n)}{n}}}$ exist? If so, what is its value? Update # $2$ : $\;$ Based on @Phicar's valuable observation, I was able to quickly generate a lot more data. The new data makes it evident that the limit in the above question doesn't exist.

3349889,Showing that Liouville's numbers are transcendental (Liouville's theorem),"From Vladimir Zorich Analysis I: Let us call an irrational number $a \in \mathbb{R}$ well approximated by rational numbers if for any natural number $n, N \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\lvert a - \frac{p}{q} \rvert < \frac{1}{Nq^n}$ . (a) Construct an example of a well-approximated irrational number. (b) Prove that a well-approximated irrational number cannot be algebraic, that is, it is transcendental (Liouville's theorem). The answer to the question (a) is $a=\sum_{n \geq 1}{\frac{1}{10^{n!}}}$ , where $a$ is called Liouville's constant. As for (b) : I've got stuck almost immediately due to lack of my knowledge of number theory. I have to show for any polynomial $P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n{a_{k}x^k}$ : $$\forall l \in \mathbb{R}, \lvert l - \frac{p}{q} \rvert < \frac{1}{Nq^n}, P(l) \neq 0$$ But suppose: $$P(l)=0$$ Then we can assume few points: $P(x)$ might have a set of rational roots $S \subset \mathbb{Q}$ , such that $l \notin S$ There exists $\frac{p}{q} \notin S$ such that $P(\frac{p}{q}) \neq 0$ $P(\frac{p}{q})=\sum_{k=0}^na_k\frac{p^k}{q^k}=a_1 \frac{p}{q} + a_{2} \frac{p^2}{p^2} + ... + a_{k} \frac{p^k}{q^k}$ . Therefore it is seen that $P(\frac{p}{q})=\frac{1}{q^n}c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and thus $P(\frac{p}{q}) \geq \frac{1}{q^n}$ Since $P(x)=0$ , then $\lvert P(x) - P(\frac{p}{q}) \rvert \geq \frac{1}{q^n}$ By triangle inequality, $\lvert l - \frac{p}{q} \rvert < \frac{1}{Nq^n} \implies \lvert l \rvert + \lvert \frac{p}{q} \rvert < \frac{1}{Nq^n} \implies \frac{p}{q} < \frac{1}{Nq^n} + \lvert l \rvert$ Question: Can I utilize the points above to construct a simple elegant proof for Liouville's theorem? Perhaps constraints from rational root theorem can be used in some way? Thank you! By the way : I've been able to find a single proof from small research , but I find it slightly implicit and complex and struggle to understand the essence of some parts. Also, I do wonder what kind of solution would be most suitable from real-analysis perspective, since Zorich only briefly touched definition of transcendal numbers and $q$ -nary approximations.","['number-theory', 'transcendence-theory', 'transcendental-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
3349931,Unwarranted Factor of t in Particular Solution,"$y'' + 3y' + 2y = t^2e^{-2t}$ The associated homogeneous solution is $y_h = Ce^{-2t} + De^{-t}$ .  My understanding is that a product of any number of functions, which are each termwise-proportional to their own derivatives, is itself termwise-proportional to its own derivative. If this is correct, then the guess for a particular solution would be $y_p = (at^2 + bt + c)(e^{-2t})$ (the proportionality constant for $e^{-2t}$ gets lumped into $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ ).  However, this yields an inconsistent algebraic system for $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ .  I have been told to multiply the guess by $t$ because this makes the correct terms pop out, but I don't understand why.  After checking via two different methods, I am confident that $e^{-2t}$ , $e^{-t}$ , and $t^2e^{-2t}$ are linearly independent.  While multiplication by $t$ works, it seems unwarranted, as this maneuver is supposed to come into play only when the associated homogeneous solution and forcing term are linearly dependent, as implied here and in pretty much every explanation of the undetermined coefficients . The rule cannot be that for $y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(t)g(t)h(t)...$ , each factor in the forcing term has to be linearly independent with the associated homogeneous solution, as $y'' + 3y' + 2y = (e^{-2t})(e^{-3t})(e^{-4t})$ would serve as a counterexample.  Why is the guess in this problem multiplied by an additional factor of $t$ , even though the homogeneous solution and forcing term are linearly independent?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'functions', 'linear-algebra', 'derivatives']"
3349932,Is this method of calculation for the first quartile correct?,"Given the numbers: $[1,2,3,4,5]$ I want to find the first quartile, so I first find the median $ = 3.$ Now I can split the numbers in the this way: $(1,2)$ $3$ $(4,5)$ Now to find the first quartile or $Q_1$ I must find the median between $(1,2)$ . So that is equal to $(1+2)/2 = 1.5$ . So according to my calculation above $Q_1=1.5$ . If I am correct then why when I search online do I get formulas for the first quartile as such: $Q_1 = \lceil{\frac{1}{4}(n+1)}\rceil th \  term$ using that formula here $Q_1$ would be $\frac{1}{4} (6) = \lceil1.5\rceil = 2$ ,which is position $2$ which is $2$ . Now obviously $2 \neq 1.5$ . So am I wrong in my above calculation ? Also this brings a curious phenomenon. Does $Q_1$ , $Q_3$ never need to be average like the median ? The median in case of even terms needs to be averaged. But why not the other quartiles ? What am I missing here?","['statistics', 'median']"

3350081,Basis for the Tangent space and derivations at a point,"So i have been reading Tu's , ""An Introduction to Manifolds"" , and i have a question that is really bugging my mind. So we have the tangent space at a point $p$ , $T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with basis $e_1,...,e_n$ is going to be isomorphic to the vector space of derivations at a point $p$ , $D_p$ . To do this the author creates the said isomorphism and proves it is in fact one. My question is the following, in this isomorphism basically is sending every tangent vector $v$ of the tangent to the directional derivative of the said vector.So far so good, my problem is that later he writes any tangent vector as a linear combination of partial derivatives and then latter when talking about differential forms and when we make computations in the proofs he uses this partial derivatives notation, so is this ok because the spaces are isomorphic ??Because they are not tangent vectors , they can just be identified as one, and can the partial derivatives in the sum really be interpreted as such??

3350099,Prove that a flow is volume-preserving if and only if the trace of corresponding ODE matrix is $0$,"I am working on the problem stated as below: Consider the linear equation $\dot{x}=Ax$ , where $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix. Let $\varphi_{t}$ be the flow generated. Verify that $$\varphi_{t}(x)=e^{At}x,\ \text{and}\ \det(\varphi_{t})=\det(e^{At})=e^{(Tr A)t},$$ so that $\varphi_{t}$ is volume-preserving if and only if $Tr(A)=0$ . I have done all the verifications. I will post my verifications after I explain my confusions. When we define a flow, we always use a vector field, say $X=(X_{1},\cdots, X_{n})$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , and we say $\varphi_{t}$ is a flow generated by this vector field, i.e. $\varphi_{t}:X\rightarrow X$ a map and $\{\varphi_{t}\}$ satisfies $$\varphi_{0}=id\ \text{and}\ \varphi_{s+t}=\varphi_{t}\circ\varphi_{s},\ \text{for all}\ s,t\in\mathbb{R}.$$ Then, we define the divergence of $X$ by $$div(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{\partial X_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}=Tr(DX),$$ and accordingly we have the following proposition Proposition: $\varphi_{t}$ is volume-preserving if and only if $div(X)=0$ everywhere on $\mathbb{R}^{n}.$ However, when I work on problems, they always use a system of ODE, instead of vector fields. How could I connect the flow generated by linear equation $\dot{x}=Ax$ to the flow generated by a vector field? If I can understand this part, I believe I can solve this problem, since I believe $Tr(A)$ must be somehow connected to $Tr(DX)$ . Thank you! Below is my verifications: To verify, firstly we have $$\dfrac{d}{dt}\varphi_{t}(x)=\dfrac{d}{dt}e^{At}x=Ae^{At}x=A\varphi_{t}(x).$$ Then, $\det(\varphi_{t})=\det(e^{At})$ immediately, and thus it remains to show $\det(e^{At})=e^{(TrA)t}$ . Firstly, we need to note that for any $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and for any invertible $n\times n$ matrix $P$ , we can write $$A^{n}=(P^{-1}AP)(P^{-1}AP)\cdots (P^{-1}AP)=P^{-1}A^{n}P,\ \text{for all}\ n, $$ such that \begin{align*}
\exp(A)&=I+A+\dfrac{1}{2!}A^{2}+\dfrac{1}{3!}A^{3}+\cdots,\\
&=P^{-1}(I+A+\dfrac{1}{2!}A^{2}+\dfrac{1}{3!}A^{3}+\cdots,)P\\
&=P^{-1}\exp(A)P.
\end{align*} If $A$ is diagonalizable, then $A$ can be written as $$A=P^{-1}JP,$$ where $P$ is invertible and $J$ is a diagonal matrix, such that we have \begin{align*}
\det(e^{A})&=\det(e^{P^{-1}JP})=\det(P^{-1}e^{J}P)\\
&=\det(P^{-1})\det(e^{J})\det(P)=\det(e^{J})\\
&=\pi_{i=1}^{n}e^{j_{ii}}=e^{\sum_{i=1}^{n}j_{ii}}\\
&=e^{tr(J)}=e^{tr(A)}, \ \text{since trace equals the sum of eigenvalues}. 
\end{align*} If $A$ is nilpotent, then since every nilpotent matrix is similar to a upper triangular matrix $D$ with $0$ s on the diagonal, we have $$A=P^{-1}DP,$$ and then by the same calculation above we have $$\det(e^{A})=e^{tr(D)}=e^{tr(A)}.$$ Finally, if $A$ is a general $n\times n$ matrix, then since any matrix $A$ can be written as $$A=D+N,$$ where $D$ a diagonal matrix and $N$ a nilpotent matrix, and since such $D$ and such $N$ commute (so that we can write $e^{A}=e^{D}e^{N}$ ), we have $$\det(e^{A})=\det(e^{D}e^{N})=\det(e^{D})\det(e^{N})=e^{Tr(D)}e^{Tr(N)}=e^{Tr(D)+Tr(N)}=e^{Tr(A)}.$$ Therefore, for any $n\times n$ matrix, we have $$\det(e^{A})=e^{Tr(A)},$$ and thus we have $$\det(e^{At})=e^{Tr(At)}=e^{(TrA)t}.$$","['vector-fields', 'divergence-operator', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

3350206,Proof Verification: Showing a function is affine if its convex and concave,"I know this question has been asked several times but the answers don't really make sense to me (I'll explain misunderstandings:) Question: Suppose that a function $f: \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is both concave and convex. Prove that $f$ is an affine function.
My solution uses: How to prove convex+concave=affine? as inspiration. However, I'm not sure if I did it correctly especially for the negative cases and I'm not exactly sure if I have showed that $g$ is linear in all cases. et $g(x)=f(x)-a$ , where $a=f(0)$ . Thus $g(0)=0$ . Also since $f$ is convex and concave, $g$ is convex and concave as well. Thus for $x,y \in \mathbb R^n $ , $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$ , by inequalities resulting from convexity and concavity we have: $g(\lambda x +(1-\lambda) y)$ = $\lambda g(x) +(1-\lambda)g(y)$ .
Does this mean $g$ is linear (why?, I don't get this from looking at the other stack-exchange posts) and hence $f$ is affine. Case 2: $\lambda >1$ .
Note $x = (1/\lambda ) (\lambda x) + (1 - 1/\lambda) (0)$ .
Note then $1/ \lambda \in [0,1]$ . 
Thus $g(x)=g((1/\lambda) (\lambda x) + (1 - 1/\lambda) (0))$ = $1/\lambda \cdot g(\lambda x)+$$(1- 1/\lambda) \cdot g(0) $ . This means $g(x)=1/\lambda * g(\lambda x)$ .
Hence $g(\lambda x)=\lambda g(x)$ . Case 3: $\lambda <0$ .
Not sure what to do now.... Perhaps I could do : Case : $\lambda \leq -1$ . $$x=(-1/\lambda)(-\lambda x)+(1+1/\lambda)(0)$$ Note that $-1/\lambda \in  [0,1]$ $g(x)=g((-1/\lambda)(-\lambda x) + (1 + 1/\lambda) (0))$ = $-1/\lambda \cdot g(-\lambda x)+$$(1+1/\lambda) \cdot g(0) $ . This means $g(x)=-1/\lambda * g(-\lambda x)$ .
Hence $g(-\lambda x)=-\lambda g(x)$ . Case: $-1< \lambda <0$ Note $-\lambda \in [0,1]$ .
Thus $x=(-\lambda)(-1/\lambda \cdot x)+(1+\lambda)(0)$ $g(x)=g((-\lambda) (-1/\lambda \cdot x) + (1 + \lambda) (0))$ = $-\lambda \cdot g(-1/\lambda \cdot x)+$$(1+\lambda) \cdot g(0) $ . This means $g(x)=-\lambda * g(-1/\lambda \cdot x)$ .
Hence $g(-1/\lambda \cdot x)=-1/ \lambda \cdot g(x)$ . Any help would much appreciated. Thanks. Thus, linear in all cases...not exactly sure if this is correct at all.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'linear-algebra', 'optimization', 'convex-analysis']"

I think there are two different understandings of ""constant"" I know the sections of the constant sheaf $A$ over an open set $U$ may be interpreted as the continuous functions $U\to A$ , where $A$ is given the discrete topology. If $U$ is connected, then these locally constant functions are constant . I feel confused with the example below, where the sections are defined on a connected set however they are not constant , I wonder what the constant means? If $X$ is locally connected, locally constant sheaves are (up to isomorphism)  exactly the sheaves of sections of covering spaces $\pi:Y\to X$ . Such a locally constant sheaf is a constant sheaf if and only the covering $\pi$ is trivial. So any non trivial  covering will give you a non-constant but locally constant sheaf. The simplest example is  the sheaf of sections of the two sheeted non trivial covering $\mathbb C^*\to \mathbb C^*:z\mapsto z^2$ or its restriction to the unit circle $S^1\to S^1: e^{i\theta}\mapsto e^{2i\theta}$","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

This is true for the special case where $a_i=b_i$ for all $i\in N$ : in this case, we can choose $S$ that maximizes $\min\left(2\sum_{i\in S}a_i,\sum_{i\in N\backslash S}a_i\right)$ . Then $S$ will be $a$ -good and $N\backslash S$ will be $b$ -good. Another solution for this special case is to use a greedy algorithm, as antkam wrote in the answer below.

3350503,Are these strengthenings of Serre-Swan and Gelfand-Naimark true?,"Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. The Serre-Swan theorem allows us to identify complex vector bundles with projective finitely generated modules over the ring $C(X;\mathbb{C})$ of complex-valued functions on $X$ . The Gelfand-Naimark theorem tells us that $X$ is determined up to homeomorphism by the C*-algebra $C(X;\mathbb{C})$ . The Gelfand-Kolmogorov theorem says that $X$ is determined up to homeomorphism by the $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra $C(X;\mathbb{R})$ . There are several things that I'm bothered with. Considering just how many functions a given space admits, and considering that any function is determined by its local behaviour at every point, I find it difficult to believe that compactness is really necessary. The asymmetry between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ is surprising. Why is there no Serre-Swan theorem for real vector bundles? And why does $C(X;\mathbb{C})$ need more algebraic structure to recover $X$ than $C(X;\mathbb{R})$ does? A search for a real Serre-Swan theorem or a complex Gelfand-Kolmogorov theorem gave me nothing. The above considerations bring me to the following conjectures. Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Conjecture 1. Complex vector bundles correspond to projective modules over the ring $C(X;\mathbb{C})$ , and real vector bundles correspond to projective modules over the ring $C(X;\mathbb{R})$ . Conjecture 2. The space $X$ is determined up to homeomorphism by the $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra $C(X;\mathbb{C})$ , as well as by the $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra $C(X;\mathbb{R})$ . Perhaps even the ring structure suffices.

3350625,"Ideal of $k[x,y]$ invariant under an involution","Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero. The two-dimensional case: Let $p,q \in k[x,y]$ , $I=\langle p,q \rangle$ a proper ideal of $k[x,y]$ and $\delta$ an involution on $k[x,y]$ , namely, a $k$ -algebra automorphism of order two.
Denote the set of symmetric elements with respect to $\delta$ by $S_{\delta}$ and the set of skew-symmetric elements with respect to $\delta$ by $K_{\delta}$ . Assume that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ .
Further assume that: (i) $\delta: (x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ . (ii) $(p,q)$ is a Jacobian pair, namely,
there exists a $k$ -algebra endomorphism $f: (x,y) \mapsto (p,q)$ such that $\operatorname{Jac}(p,q):=p_xq_y-p_yq_x \in k-\{0\}$ . Is the following claim true:
  There exist $k$ -algebra automorphisms $g,h$ of $k[x,y]$ ,
  such that one of $\{(gfh)(x),(gfh)(y)\}$ belongs to $S_\epsilon \cup K_\epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is an involution on $k[x,y]$ . Remarks: (a) It can be shown that there exist two conjugacy classes of involutions on $k[x,y]$ : That of $(x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ (Jacobian $-1$ ) and that of $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,-y)$ (Jacobian $1$ ). (b) An easy observation: If $p$ is symmetric w.r.t. an involution $\beta$ ,
then $g^{-1}(p)$ is symmetric w.r.t. $\gamma= g^{-1}\beta g$ ; indeed, $p=\beta(p)$ , so $p=(g \gamma g^{-1})(p)$ , then $g^{-1}(p)=\gamma (g^{-1}(p))$ .
(Same argument with skew-symmetric instead of symmetric). (c) Notice that Arthur's comment is included in the above claim;
indeed, $k-\{0\} \ni \operatorname{Jac}(aS+bK,cS+dK)=(ad-bc)\operatorname{Jac}(S,K)$ , so $ad-bc \in k-\{0\}$ (which means that $aS+bK, cS+dK$ are linearly independent over $k$ ). If one of $\{a,b,c,d\}$ equals to zero, then we are done.
Otherwise, it is not difficult to find an automorphism g of $k[x,y]$ such that $g(p)=S$ or $g(p)=K$ , and we are also done. (d) Am I missing a known theorem that can be applied here? Perhaps a theorem concerning group actions? Fixed points theorems? Algebraic geometry? C-star algebras? Please see this question. The one-dimensional case: Notice that in $k[x]$ an analog result holds, at least for $\delta: x \mapsto -x$ , (which is actually the 'unique' involution on $k[x]$ ) namely: If $I$ is an ideal of $k[x]$ which is invariant under $\delta$ , then $I=\langle h \rangle$ , where $h$ is either an odd polynomial (= a skew-symmetric element with respect to $\delta$ ) or an even polynomial (= a symmetric element with respect to $\delta$ ). Indeed: $k[x]$ is a PID, so $I=\langle h \rangle$ , for some $h \in k[x]$ . We assumed that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ , hence, in particular, $\delta(h) \in I$ ,
so there exists $g \in k[x]$ such that $\delta(h)=gh$ . Of course, $\deg(\delta(h))=\deg(h)$ and $\deg(gh)=\deg(g)+\deg(h)$ .
Therefore, $\deg(g)=0$ , so $g=\lambda \in k$ . Write $h=s+k$ with $s$ even (= symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ and $k$ odd (= skew-symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ ).
We have $s-k=\delta(h)=\lambda h= \lambda (s+k)$ .
Then, $(1-\lambda)s=(1+\lambda)k$ . Denote $w:=(1-\lambda)s=(1+\lambda)k$ . From $S_{\delta} \cap K_{\delta} =\{0\}$ , we obtain that $w=0$ , so $(1-\lambda)s=0$ and $(1+\lambda)k=0$ . (i) $(1-\lambda)s=0$ implies that $\lambda=1$ or $s=0$ .
If $\lambda=1$ , then $\delta(h)=h$ , so $h$ is symmetric.
If $s=0$ , then $h$ is skew-symmetric. (ii) $(1+\lambda)k=0$ implies that $\lambda=-1$ or $k=0$ .
If $\lambda=-1$ , then $\delta(h)=-h$ , so $h$ is skew-symmetric.
If $k=0$ , then $h$ is symmetric. Concluding that $h$ is symmetric or skew-symmetric, as claimed. Remark: Concerning the 'uniqueness' of the involution $x \mapsto -x$ ;
there exists other involutions, for example, $f_c: x \mapsto -x+c$ , for arbitrary $c \in k$ .
( $f_c^2(x)=f_c(f_c(x))=f_c(-x+c)=-f_c(x)+c=-(-x+c)+c=x-c+c=x$ ). Luckily, my above argument (for $\delta=f_0$ ) still shows that if $f_c(I) \subseteq I$ , $c \in k$ , then $I=\langle h \rangle$ with $h$ symmetric or skew-symmetric with respect to $f_c$ ;
indeed, the only place where we used the specific form of $\delta=f_0$ was 
""Of course, $\deg(\delta(h))=\deg(h)$ "", and this trivial observation still holds if we replace $\delta=f_0$ by $f_c$ , $c \in k-\{0\}$ . Concerning the two-dimensional case: Write $p=s_1+k_1$ and $q=s_2+k_2$ ,
where $s_1,s_2 \in S_{\delta}$ and $k_1,k_2 \in K_{\delta}$ , $\delta: (x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ . Several attempts/ideas to answer my question: (1) By assumption, $\delta(p) \in I=\langle p,q \rangle$ ,
so $s_1-k_1 = A(s_1+k_1)+B(s_2+k_2)$ , for some $A,B \in k[x,y]$ .
Then $(1-A)s_1-Bs_2=(1+A)k_1+Bk_2$ ; however, this does not tell much,
since $A,B \in k[x,y]$ , not in $k$ . (If $A,B \in k$ , then we obtain that $w=0$ ,
where $w:=(1-A)s_1-Bs_2=(1+A)k_1+Bk_2$ . 
Therefore, $s_1=\mu s_2$ and $k_1= \nu k_2$ , 
where $\mu,\nu \in k$ , and we have obtained the special form
that Arthur has suggested). We can further write: $A=A_s+A_k$ and $B=B_s+B_k$ ,
where $A_s,B_s \in S_\delta$ and $A_k,B_k \in K_\delta$ . (2) I have written $s_1,s_2,k_1,k_2$ as elements of $I$ ,
and also applied $\delta$ on both sides,
but the equations I have reached did not help much.
Perhaps I will add my calculations later. (3) We have assumed that $p \neq q$ , since otherwise $I=\langle p \rangle$ ,
so the one-dimensional proof can be adjusted here, in short: We assumed that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ , hence, in particular, $\delta(p) \in I=\langle p \rangle$ ,
so there exists $g \in k[x,y]$ such that $\delta(p)=gp$ . Of course, $\deg(\delta(p))=\deg(p)$ and $\deg(gp)=\deg(g)+\deg(p)$ .
Therefore, $\deg(g)=0$ , so $g=\lambda \in k$ . From $p=s_1+k_1$ with $s_1$ symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ and $k_1$ skew-symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ ,
we have $s_1-k_1=\delta(p)=\lambda p= \lambda (s_1+k_1)$ .
Then, $(1-\lambda)s_1=(1+\lambda)k_1$ . Denote $w:=(1-\lambda)s_1=(1+\lambda)k_1$ . From $S_{\delta} \cap K_{\delta} =\{0\}$ , we obtain that $w=0$ , so $(1-\lambda)s_1=0$ and $(1+\lambda)k_1=0$ ,
and the same arguments as above show that $p$ is symmetric or skew-symmetric. Same question for the first Weyl algebra $A_1(k)$ over $k$ , $k\langle x,y | yx-xy=1 \rangle$ , instead of $k[x,y]$ .
Replace the Jacobian $\operatorname{Jac}(p,q):=p_xq_y-p_yq_x$ by the commutator $[p,q]:=pq-qp$ .
Notice that in the non-commutative case there are involutions and anti-involutions. I have now noticed this slightly similar question. I have asked my above question also in MO . Thank you very much!","['involutions', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials', 'commutative-algebra']"

I see that here we can show every convergent sequence in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ (and its limit) must lie in some $\mathbb{R}^n$ . So I guess to prove the statement, we can suppose for a contradiction that a compact set $K$ is not contained in any $\mathbb{R}^n$ .

Here he requires a generalized derivative must be Borel measurable as follows: I knew that a Lipschitz function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is in $W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$ and is differentiable Lebesgue almost everywhere. But usually $W^{1,\infty}$ means Lebesuge measurable weak derivatives. Could you suggest any reference which shows a Lipschitz function has a Borel measurable weak derivative?

3351171,"Subgroup of multiples of $m$, $m$-torsion and $p$-subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_n$","Disclaimer: this terminology might be different from what you're used to and this is why I'm writing down some definitions first. Let $A$ be an abelian group, $m \in \mathbb{N}^* := \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and let $p$ be a prime number. We define: The subgroup of multiples of $m$ in $A$ as the set $mA := \{\,ma \, \mid \, a \in A\,\}$ . The $m$ -torsion of $A$ as the set $A[m] := \{\,a \in A \, \mid \, ma = 0\,\}$ . The $p$ -subgroup of $A$ as the set $A(p) := \{\,a \in A \, \mid \, p^k a = 0 \hspace{1mm} \text{for some} \hspace{1mm} k \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ . I've proven these are all subgroups of $A$ . It is known that $A(p) = \{\,a \in A \, \mid \, o(a) = p^k \hspace{1mm} \text{for some} \hspace{1mm} k \in \mathbb{N}\,\}$ . Now we want to prove the following statement considering $A := \mathbb{Z}_n$ . Square brackets (or a bar if it's a single letter) denote the equivalence class of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ , whereas the angle brackets denote the subgroup genereated by the element within them and finally the $\simeq$ symbol denotes an isomorphism. $m\mathbb{Z}_n = \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}$ $\mathbb{Z}_n[m] = \mathbb{Z}_n[\gcd(n,m)] = \langle [\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}] \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(n,m)}$ If $n = p^r n'$ and $p \nmid n'$ (not divides), then $\mathbb{Z}_n(p) = \langle n' \rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ I've tried to solve it in this way. First of all, we have that $\gcd(n,m) \mid m$ , so there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $m = \gcd(n,m)k$ . Given an element $\bar{x} \in m\mathbb{Z}_n$ , by definition there exists $\bar{a} \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ such that $\bar{x} = m \bar{a}$ and therefore $\bar{x} = \gcd(n,m)k\bar{a} = \gcd(n,m)[ka]$ . This proves that $\bar{x} \in \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n$ , thus $m\mathbb{Z}_n \subseteq \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n$ . I was not able to prove the inclusion $\supseteq$ though. Then I guess I solved the equality $\gcd(n,m) = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle$ . In fact (tell me if I'm mistaken somewhere): \begin{align}
 \gcd(n,m)\mathbb{Z}_n & = \{\,\gcd(n,m)\bar{a} \, \mid \, \bar{a} \in \mathbb{Z}_n\,\} \\ & = \{\,[\gcd(n,m)a] \, \mid \, a \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} \\ & = \{\,a[\gcd(n,m)] \, \mid \, a \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} = \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle
\end{align} For the isomorphism part, let $f \colon \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \to \mathbb{Z}_{\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}}$ be the map defined by $f(k[\gcd(n,m)]) := \bar{k}$ . This is trivially a surjective homomorphism. It is injective, too, since: \begin{align}
 \ker{f} & = \{\,k[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, f(k[\gcd(n,m)]) = \bar{0}\,\} \\ & = \{\,k[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, \bar{k} = \bar{0}\,\} \\ & = \{\,nh[\gcd(n,m)] \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, h \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} \\ & = \{\,h\gcd(n,m)\bar{n} \in \langle [\gcd(n,m)] \rangle \, \mid \, h \in \mathbb{Z}\,\} = \{\bar{0}\}
\end{align} Am I on the right track or is there a better way to prove this stuff? And if this is the right way, how can I complete this proof including statement 2. and 3.? Edit: I found a better way to prove all isomorphisms. I use this result (the order of an element $a \in G$ is denoted by $o(a)$ ): Let $G$ be a cyclic group, $G = \langle a \rangle$ . If $o(a) = n$ , then $G \simeq \mathbb{Z}_n$ . Now one easily verifies the following conditions: $o([\gcd(n,m)]) = \frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}$ $o([\frac{n}{\gcd(n,m)}]) = \gcd(n,m)$ $o([n']) = p^r$ So I only need to prove the equalities now if my reasoning is correct.","['modular-arithmetic', 'gcd-and-lcm', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"

3351330,"Proof for ""coin sharing"" game","$m$ coins are distributed in some fashion to $n$ people arranged in a circle.
A game ""move"" is as follows: a person that has at least two coins gives two coins away, one to the person to her left and one to the person to her right.
The game ends when there are no more moves. By the pigeonhole principle, is easy to see that the game never ends when $m>n$ .
If $m=n$ , the game can end or continue forever, depending on the initial distribution of coins.
I'm looking for a proof that the game always ends when $m<n$ . This is not from a book. Someone (don't know who) wrote a math enrichment lesson based on it (pigeonhole principle, etc.) but did not provide a proof. I'm trying to reuse it for another lesson. Coin sharing can be simultaneous, but it turns out that this is not important, the ""moves"" can be performed in any order (I don't have a nice proof for this either). I tried assigning to each position a number that decreases with each move, for example the maximum average for blocks of adjacent people that have at least one coin. If you do all the coin exchanges inside a block of adjacent people with at least one coin each, only the people at the two ends are affected (they lose a coin). I also tried induction (without success, obviously). A block of 𝑘 adjacent people with a total of 𝑝 coins acts, in some ways, like a block of 𝑘−1 people with a total of 𝑝−1 coins. Another interesting fact (again, without proof) is that no coin will do a complete revolution around the circle.","['puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

G---------------------A---------------B----------------------------------C----- The following values are known.  (We are working in metric so I've provided some conversion factors if you require them.) AB = 800 metres
BC = 8750 metres
ab = 290 millimetres
bc = 415 millimetres

1 metre = 1000 millimetres
1 metre = 3.28084 feet
1 inch = 25.4 millimetres The following assumptions are made. The Earth is flat!
There is no refraction.
The viewpoint is with the naked eye. Question:  What is the location of ""P"", i.e. the values for GA and GP? Although there is obviously a relationship between the mathematical plane of the photograph and that of the ground, I've been unable to figure out how to represent it. Previous questions I found on here of a similar theme (below) were unanswered so I've tried to provide more information, especially by way of the pictorial representation. How can I calculate the GPS coordinate of an object in an image using the distance, angle and GPS coordinate of the center of the image in python? Ask Locating Geographic Coordinates in an Oblique Photograph And for the adventurous... I'm willing to believe it's possible that the location of P has multiple solutions, i.e. it's defined by a curve.  In this case the question would be, What is the function for the curve? And probably related (but possibly a separate issue), it's likely the photo was taken using a telephoto lens from higher and further away.  Again in this case the question would be, What is the function for the curve? Thanks Wayne","['trigonometry', 'geometry']"

I'm using [1, Sec 3.1] as a reference for this approach. However, I'm getting a different result than what I expect, which is $\propto \int_0^R \sinh^{n-1}(r) dr$ ( wiki ), and I wonder what I'm doing wrong. I assume it's something that has to do with how I'm handling the metric tensor, but I couldn't pinpoint it precisely. Do I misinterpret the volume formula from above? My approach is to use the Poincaré ball model because that's the model I'm familiar with where the metric tensor has a nice expression: $g(x) = \Big(\frac{2}{1 - \lVert x \rVert^2}\Big)^2 I_n$ .  Because it only depends on $x$ via its extrinsic norm, the integral above separates per angular coordinates and radial distance. I want to compute the latter which amounts to computing $\sqrt{\det g(x)}$ for $x$ with $d(0, x) = r$ and then integrating over $r$ from $0$ to $R$ . We have, $$d(0, x) = \cosh^{-1}\Big(1 + 2 \frac{\lVert x \rVert^2}{1 - \lVert x \rVert^2}\Big) = r \implies \lVert x \rVert^2 = \frac{\cosh(r) - 1}{\cosh(r) + 1},$$ and $$\sqrt{\det g(x)} = \Big(\frac{2}{1 - \lVert x \rVert^2}\Big)^n.$$ Finally, substituting the former into the latter gives $\sqrt{\det g(x)} = \big(\cosh(r) + 1\big)^n$ which is different than the expected $\sinh^{n-1}(r)$ .

Set $A$ is said to be countable if there exists a bijection from $A$ to $\mathbb{N}$ . Every countable set is infinite To show that : Union of two countable sets is countable Suppose $A$ and $B$ are countable.
Assume at first that $A\cap B=\phi$ $A $ countable $\Rightarrow \exists f:A\to \mathbb{N} $ a bijection. $B $ countable $\Rightarrow \exists g:B\to \mathbb{N} $ a bijection. define. $h:A\cup B \to N$ as $x\mapsto 2f(x) \; $ if $x\in A$ $x\mapsto 2g(x)+1$ if $x\in B$ Because $A\cup B$ is infinite, it is sufficient to show that $h$ is injective in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable. if $x=y$ , where $x,y\in A\cup B$ , since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, so,  either both $x$ and $y$ belong to $A$ or both belong to $B$ , and because $f$ and $g$ are well defined, so is $h$ Now let $h(x)=h(y)$ where $x,y \in A\cup B$ again, $x$ and $y$ can both belong to $A$ or can both belong to $B$ . Hence injectivity of $h$ on $A\cup B$ follows directly from the injectivity of $f$ and $g$ on $A$ and $B$ respectively Hence, $A\cup B$ is countable. Now, let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary countable sets, then by above method, $A\cup B = [A\setminus (A\cap B)]\cup[A\cap B]\cup [B\setminus (A\cap B)]$ is countable.

$$ Now, I am interested in calculating the diagonal terms of this product, but without having to calculate all the other terms in the process (this will be in a code where $n$ and $p$ are very large). I wrote it on a simple example and ended up with : $$
diag(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \sum Col\left(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}^\mathsf{T} \right)
$$ with $\cdot$ the inner product between the two matrices, and $\sum Col$ the sum on the columns of the matrix. Sorry if my formalism is bad, I wrote it in a coding style, so please feel free to correct me. I tested it on my code and it matches, but : How could I demonstrate that properly? Is there a theorem or a property for that? I failed to find it on the internet... Thanks for your time!","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
3353392,How many ways can you arrange 3 pennies and 2 nickels in a line?,All coins of the same type are indistinguishable. So I start with a 5 choose 3 for the pennies. 5!/(3!2!). Giving me 10 ways to arrange the pennies. For each combination of the pennies it seems there is only one way to place the two indistinguishable nickels. Is the final answer simply 10?

Let's say I have some $(x,y)$ data and want to check how well it fits an ordinary differential equation with no closed-form solution such as $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+x^2\frac{dy}{dx}+x=0$$ How would I apply statistical inference techniques such as $p-value$ interpretation and R-Squared to something like this (or more complex ODEs)?","['regression', 'regression-analysis', 'statistical-inference', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

I disagreed and said that you cannot combine radians and degrees without conversion (and also that $\frac{\pi}{5}$ +360 $^{\circ}$ is not an angle). He says that is just semantics and that 360 $^{\circ}$ is in fact, 2 ${\pi}$ . Who is right?",['trigonometry']

These two sums were proposed by Cornel here where he asked if these results and others ( in the link) exist in the literature. I managed to find a relation between $S_1$ and $S_2$ so we need to find another relation or evaluate of them separately. Here is how I got the relation: From here we have $$\int_0^1 x^{2n-1}\ln^2(1-x)\ dx=\frac{H_{2n}^2+H_{2n}^{(2)}}{2n}$$ multiply both sides by $\frac{H_n}{2n}$ then sum them from $n=1$ to $\infty$ to get $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_n}{(2n)^2}(H_{2n}^2+H_{2n}^{(2)})=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)}{x}\sum_{n=1}^\infty(x^2)^n\frac{H_n}{n}\ dx\\=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)}{x}\left(\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2)+\frac12\ln^2(1-x^2)\right)\ dx\\=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)}{x}\left(2\operatorname{Li}_2(x)+2\operatorname{Li}_2(-x)+\frac12\ln^2(1-x^2)\right)\ dx\\=\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)\operatorname{Li}_2(x)}{x}+\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)\operatorname{Li}_2(-x)}{x}+\frac14\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1-x)\ln^2(1-x^2)}{x}\ dx\\=A+B+\frac14C$$ \begin{align}

Let $x_1,x_2,...$ be a sequence of independent random real numbers picked using a uniform probability distribution on the interval $[0,1]$ , and let us send each $x_n$ through an oracle which tells us whether $x_n\in E$ or not.  And then let us define the measure of $E$ to be the limit of the fraction of the first $n$ elements which are in $E$ , as $n$ goes to infinity. My question is, for what sets $E$ does this limit exist?  Does it exist for all sets $E$ , or only for Lebesgue-measurable sets, or what?  What exactly happens when you try the procedure for non-Lebesgue measurable sets?  Will the limit just diverge?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'measurable-sets', 'oracles', 'probability-theory']"

It basically says that the probability of a state is independent of its history, but only depends upon its immediately previous state.
