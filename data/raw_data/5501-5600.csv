40905,A quadratic reciprocity formula,"Inspired by a problem of calculating explicitly the invariants by Reshetikhin and Turaev for certain 3-manifolds, I have come across the following problem involving Gauss sums: I would like to prove that
$$\sum_{n=0}^k e^{-\tfrac{2\pi i}{4k+8}(n^2+2n)} = e^{\pi i/(2k+4)}\left(\sqrt{\tfrac{k}{2}+1}e^{-\pi i/4} - \frac{-e^{-\pi ik/2}+1}{2} \right).$$ Edits: By a number of simplifications (see the comments below), this becomes
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} e^{\tfrac{\pi i}{2r}n^2} = \sqrt{r}\frac{1+i}{2} - \frac{e^{\pi i r/2} + 1}{2}.$$ This on the other hand is equivalent to
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} e^{\tfrac{\pi i}{2r}n^2} = \sum_{n=1}^{r-1} e^{\tfrac{\pi i}{2r}(n+r)^2}$$ for all $r$, and this can be checked by noting that the two sums contain the same terms. The rest of this question is left over from my original wording: When $k$ (or $r$) is even, this formula holds by the following quadratic reciprocity theorem (and a couple of tricks): Let $a,b,c$ be integers, $a \not= 0$, $c \not= 0$, and assume that $ac+b$ is even. Then $$\sum_{n=0}^{\lvert c \rvert -1} e^{\pi i(an^2+bn)/c} = \lvert c/a \rvert^{1/2} e^{\pi i (\lvert ac \rvert-b^2)/(4ac)} \sum_{n=0}^{\lvert a\rvert-1} e^{-\pi i (c n^2+b n)/a}.$$ However, when my $k$ is odd, this can not be applied directly. Any suggestions are welcome.","['geometric-topology', 'number-theory']"

40917,find birational maps of a hypersurface onto $\mathbb{A}^2$,"Consider $$Y = V(y^2-x^3) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^2$$ Now, $\phi: \mathbb{A} \to Y, t \mapsto (t^2,t^3)$
is a birational map,
but the pullback $\phi^\ast: K[x,y]/(y^2-x^3) \to K[t], x \mapsto t^2, y \mapsto t^3$, is not an isomorphism of K-algebras. (Do we say: $\phi$ is not an ""isomorphism of varieties""?) Now if we localize in the origin we get an isomorphism of the local rings at $0$:
$(K[x,y]/(y^2-x^3))_{(x,y)} \rightarrow K[t,t^{-1}]$, which gives us the ""rational"" parametrization $t \mapsto (t^2,t^3)$. Is this correct?

40964,Looking for a proof for the convergence of matrix geometric series,"Consider a symmetric matrix $A$ with non-negative integer coefficients. It appears that the geometric series $\sum_{i \geq 0}A^i$ will converge to a matrix $B$ if the spectral radius (the largest eigenvalue in absolute value) is less than 1. I would like to extend this result to a case where the matrix doesn't have integer coefficients but generating functions (with real coefficients) instead and to do so, I'd be interested in having a closer look at the proof of the standard case. The questions I'm trying to figure out are: 1) is there a standard proof in a general case where we're dealing with a ring with a norm, than the geometric series has 1 as radius of convergence? Or what's the most obvious proof in the specific case of symmetric non-negative matrices? 2) what is the good equivalent of the case of matrices with integer coefficients that aren't necessarily symmetric. I'm quite interested in keeping the link to the eigenvalues and not in other matrix norms. 3) when dealing with matrices of generating functions (on one variable for a start), can I think of the eigenvalues as generating functions as well? Would that be the good way to think of this result on geometric series?

If $ v \neq 0 \in V_{\lambda_i} \cap V_{\lambda_j} $ for some $i,j, i \neq j $, then $ \alpha(v) = \lambda_i v $ and $ \alpha(v) = \lambda_j v $. So $(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)v = 0 $, and so $ \lambda_i = \lambda_j $. This is a contradiction, so any pair of the eigenspaces have trivial intersection. Therefore $ \cap_{i=1}^n V_{\lambda_i} = \{0\} $, and so we have a direct sum. Is this ok? Thanks",['linear-algebra']

40996,"Prove that if $(ab)^i = a^ib^i \forall a,b\in G$ for three consecutive integers $i$ then $G$ is abelian.","I've been working on this problem listed in Herstein's Topics in Algebra (Chapter 2.3, problem 4): If $G$ is a group such that $(ab)^i = a^ib^i$ for three consecutive integers $i$ for all $a, b\in G$, show that $G$ is abelian. I managed to prove it, but I'm not very happy with my result (I think there's a neater way to prove this). Anyway, I'm just looking to see if there's a different approach to this. My approach : Let $j=i+1, k=i+2$ for some $i\in \mathbb{Z}$. Then we have that $(ab)^i = a^ib^i$, $(ab)^j = a^jb^j$ and $(ab)^k = a^kb^k$. If $(ab)^k = a^kb^k$, then $a^jb^jab =a^jab^jb$. We cancel on the left and right and we have $b^ja = ab^j$, that is $b^iba = ab^j$. Multiply both sides by $a^i$ on the left and we get $a^ib^iba = a^jb^j$, so $(ab)^iba = (ab)^j$. But that is $(ab)^iba = (ab)^iab$. Cancelling on the left yields $ab=ba$, which holds for all $a,b \in G$, and therefore, $G$ is abelian. Thanks!","['group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"

It's in the end of chapter review and it's associated with the section about the alternating series test. There's a hint: refer to an equation from a previous section on the integral test. Specifically: $$L=\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n-\int_1^n\! f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right]$$ Here, $\{a_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence of positive numbers and $f(x)$ is a decreasing function such that $f(n)=a_n$, and $\gamma$ is this limit in the case that $a_n=\frac{ 1}{n}$. New users can't answer their own questions inside of 8 hours, so I'm editing my question to reflect the answer. Ok, I got it. Following the hint in the book $$L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\frac{\ln 2}{2}+\frac{\ln 3}{3}+\cdots+\frac{\ln n}{n}-\int_2^n\! \frac{\ln x}{x}\,\mathrm{d}x\right]$$ $$=\lim\left[\frac{ \ln 2}{2}+\cdots+\frac{ \ln n}{n}-\left.\frac{ \ln^2x}{2}\right|_2^n\right]$$ The partial sum for the positive series is:
$$\left(\frac{\ln^2n}{2}-\frac{\ln^2}{2}\right)+L+o(1)$$ Returning to the original, alternating series:
$$-S_{2n}=\frac{ -\ln 2}{2}+\frac{ \ln 3}{3}-\frac{\ln 4}{4}+\frac{\ln 5}{5}-\cdots$$
$$=\frac{\ln 2}{2}+\frac{\ln 3}{3}+\cdots+\frac{\ln 2n}{2n}-2\left(\frac{\ln 2}{2}+\frac{\ln 4}{4}+\cdots+\frac{\ln 2n}{2n}\right)$$ Consider the partial sum in parentheses
$$ \frac{\ln 2}{2}+\frac{\ln 4}{4}+\cdots+\frac{\ln 2n}{2n}=\frac{\ln 2}{2}+\frac{\ln 2 +\ln 2}{4}+\frac{\ln 2+\ln 3}{6}+\cdots+\frac{\ln 2+\ln n}{2n}$$
$$=\frac{1}{2}\left(\ln 2\left(1+\frac{ 1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{ 1}{n}\right)+\left(\frac{ \ln 2}{2}+\frac{ \ln 3}{3}+\cdots+\frac{ \ln n}{n}\right)\right)$$ Now, plug that back in
$$-S_{2n}=\left(\frac{\ln 2}{2}+\cdots+\frac{ \ln 2n}{2n}\right)-\ln 2\left(1+\frac{ 1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{ 1}{n}\right)-\left(\frac{ \ln 2}{2}+\frac{ \ln 3}{3}+\cdots+\frac{ \ln n}{n}\right)$$
$$=\frac{ \ln^2(2n)}{2}-\frac{ \ln^2 2}{2}+L+o(1)-\ln 2\left(\ln n +\gamma+o(1)\right)-\left(\frac{ \ln^2 n}{2}-\frac{ \ln^2 2}{2}+L+o(1)\right)$$
$$=\frac{ (\ln 2 +\ln n)^2}{2}-(\ln 2)(\ln n)-\gamma\ln 2-\frac{ \ln^2 n}{2}+o(1)$$
$$=\frac{ \ln^2 2}{2}+(\ln 2)(\ln n)+\frac{ \ln^2 n}{2}-(\ln 2)(\ln n)-\gamma \ln 2 - \frac{ \ln^2 n}{2}+o(1)$$
$$-S_{2n}\to\frac{ \ln^2}{2}-\gamma\ln 2$$

41026,How to find angle of motion in frictionless space based on vx and vy,"This might, perhaps, be more suited to Stack Overflow or the Gaming section, but since it's math that is above my head, I thought I'd come straight here for it. I'm making a space game.  So far I have a spaceship that has a maximum velocity (kept in check by a function that finds the hypotenuse of the triangle made by its vx and vy and ensures that the length of the hypotenuse never surpasses the max_speed), and proper acceleration implemented (as well as proper tracking of angle of rotation in order to generate the vx and vy values).  It flies quite nicely.  What I'm having trouble with is finding the current angle of motion, as opposed to the current angle the ship is facing. I know that, for a right triangle, I can find the theta (angle/slope) by calculating the arctangent of the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side.  In my game, this translates to: Math.atan(vy/vx).  The only problem is that it only outputs a result between -90 and 90.  I know that's how it's supposed to work (based on what I know about the unit circle, etc.), and so I'm stumped.  I can't seem to figure out a way to do what I need to do. Here are two specific examples of troublesome results:
-when vx is 1 and vy is 1, I get atan(1) = 45
-when vx is -1 and vy is -1, I get atan(1) = 45 And so therein lies the heart of the issue.  The ship could be moving in the exact opposite direction and it would give me the same angle. I was thinking of writing a function to modify the output depending on which quadrant the motion was facing.  For instance: if vx and vy were both negative, then the angle should be between 270 and 360, or if they were both positive, between 90 and 180.  The only issue is the reflection of the result across the axes.  I rotate clockwise from 0 degrees, and it counts down from 90 to 0, then down to -90 when I reach the 180 mark, then back up from -90 to 0 as I approach 270, and from 0 to 90 as I pass 270 and on to 360. Is there any formula I can use, into which I can input my current x speed and y speed, and receive the angle, between 0 and 359 (or 1 and 360, whichever works)?  By the way, for my purposes, 0/360/2pi is oriented directly up, 12 o'clock, facing the top edge of the screen. I have looked all over Google all day long for ""rigid body dynamics,"" ""kinematics,"" and any of a number of other keywords I could think of or find to help find a viable solution -- and I have read countless articles and forums threads about related subjects -- but it appears as though nobody has ever asked or answered this question on the internet (I'm sure it's out there someplace and I'm just too dense or unlucky to find it). I have read these, too: http://chrishecker.com/images/d/df/Gdmphys1.pdf Calculating an Angle from $2$ points in space Help with calculating the angle to turn towards a target in a coordinatesystem This one almost answered my question, but I'm not entirely sure how to work with it: Angle for pointing at a certain point in 2d space I tried implementing the last suggestion from that thread like so:
reverse_angle = roundNumber(radToDeg(Math.cos(vy / (Math.sqrt((vx * vx) + (vy * vy))))),0);
but it just gave me angles between 0 and 90, which really wasn't too helpful. To simplify the question, I'm basically looking for a way to turn the ship to face exactly opposite its current vector, so I can simplify the deceleration process (which I will put to use in the AI when I get to that part, but it's also part of the control scheme: pressing the down arrow reverses your angle as a form of deceleration autopilot to help newbies adjust to unassisted 2D Newtonian spaceflight).

Thank you very much. ...and here's my current project with the changes in place: http://adrian.thomas-prestemon.com/game/v3 There is still a bug in the max_speed section of the code, which I hadn't noticed before, but I'll work on that in my own time, or maybe post it to stackoverflow, since it doesn't really belong here.  This bug happens when you're accelerating in any given direction, and then rotate while accelerating.  Somehow the ship's speed escapes the boundaries I placed on it, and then there is no way to get the speed back below the maximum. Oops.  :P","['vector-spaces', 'trigonometry', 'physics']"

But this seems a bit unsatisfying for two reasons: Why do we need to make such an assumption at all?  For a given set $S$, if we explicitly construct a function $p:2^S \rightarrow [0,1]$ and show that it has the desired properties, then we didn't need to assume the existence of such a function; conversely, if we can't find such a function, then it seems that we can't say anything about probabilities in the first place!

  closure. Suppose $f(z)$ is holomorphic on an open set $U$ containing $\bar D$

  Show that for any $z$ in $D,$
  $$\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta=2\pi i(1-f(z)).$$ Note that D here means the opposite of what it usually means. What I am interested in is where my approach goes wrong. Let $g(\zeta)=f(1/\zeta).$ Then $$\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta=-\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{g(\zeta)}{\zeta^{-1}-z}d\zeta.$$ The reasoning is that the values on the right-hand side are identical to those on the left, and the direction is just reversed. So we would like to prove that $$\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{g(\zeta)}{\zeta^{-1}-z}d\zeta=2\pi i(f(z)-1),$$ but for some reason I keep getting that it's $-2\pi if(z)/z^2.$ The nice thing about $g$ is that it's holomorphic within an open set containing the unit disk, since the limit condition on $f$ allows us to define $g(0)=1.$ Thus, the integrand has only one pole, of order 1, at $w=1/z.$ Then
$$\mathrm{Res}_w=\lim_{\zeta\to w}\frac{g(\zeta)}{\zeta^{-1}-z}\left(\zeta-\frac{1}{z}\right)$$

41211,Two questions on determinability (probability theory),"The following are some problems I encountered when self-learning GTM 261 ""Probability and Stochastics"". Definition (determinability) If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables taking values in $(E,\mathcal{E})$ and $(D,\mathcal{D})$, then we say that $X$ determines $Y$ if $Y=f\circ X$ for some $f:E\rightarrow D$ measurable with respect to $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{D}$. Problem 1 Let $T$ be a positive random variable and define a stochastic process $X=(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ by setting, for each $\omega$ 
  $$
X_t(\omega) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t < T(\omega) \\
1 & \text{if } t \geq T(\omega)
\end{cases}
$$
  Show that $X$ and $T$ determine each other. If $T$ represents the time of failure for a device, then $X$ is the process that indicates whether the device has failed or not. That $X$ and $T$ determine each other is intuitively obvious, but the measurability issues cannot be ignored altogether. In particular, I do not know how to show the measurability part. Problem 2 A slight change in the preceding exercise shows that one might guard against raw intuition. Let $T$ have a distribution that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}_+$; in fact, all we need is that $\mathbb{P}\{T = t\} = 0$ for every $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$. Define
  $$ X_t(\omega) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } t = T(\omega)\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
  Show that, for each $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$, the random variable $X_t$ is determined by $T$. But, contrary to raw intuition, $T$ is not determined by $X=(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$. Show this by the following steps below: a. For each $t$, we have $X_t = 0$ almost surely. Therefore, for every sequence $(t_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}_+$, $X_{t_1} = X_{t_2} = \ldots = 0$ almost surely. b. If $V\in \sigma(X)$, then $V = c$ almost surely for some constant $c$. It follows that $T$ is not in $\sigma(X)$.",['probability-theory']

First I assume the sequence of binomialcoefficients $ \{ b_k = \binom k2 \}_{k=2\to\infty}=\{1,3,6,10,15,...\}$ Then to assign a meaningful value to the alternating sum $ S= 1-3+6+10.... $ I compute the Abel-sum $ \qquad S = \lim_{x \to 1} 1-3x+6x^2-10x^3+...-... = {1 \over (1+x)^3 } = 1/8 $ (Abel) But I want to proceed one more step. The sequence of partial sums may be denoted as $ \{ c_k \}_{k=0\to\infty}=\{1,-2,4,-6,9,-12,16,-20,...\} $ Q - my question is : what is the sum $ T = 1-2+4-6+9... $ ? I tried two approaches, but I'm lost.
The generating function is simply $ 1/(1+x)^3/(1-x) $ but here I cannot let x approach 1, so the simple application of the Abel-sum is impossible. Also the Euler-sum seems to not to converge; instead I get increasing partial sums like k/16 for the k'th partial sum . On the other hand, I observe, that the coefficients are near the squares, so if I consider the alternating $\zeta$ (usually called Dirichlet-$\eta$) $ \qquad \qquad \begin{eqnarray} X &=& 1 - 2.25 + 4 - 6.25 + 9 - 12.25 + ...  \\ &=&( 4 - 9 + 16 - 25 + ... - ...)/4 \\ &=& (1-\eta(-2))/4 \\ &=& (1-0)/4 = {1 \over 4} \end{eqnarray}$ then in T I had just each second coefficient $1/4$ above that of the $\eta$-series in X and possibly could go along something like $ \qquad \qquad \begin{eqnarray} T &=& 1 - (2.25-0.25) + 4 - (6.25-0.25) + ... - ... \\
&=& X + 0.25*\zeta(0) \\
&=& X-1/8 = {1 \over 8} \end{eqnarray}$ But surely this is only an outline how I could come nearer to a solution. How could I actually proceed here? [update]: One more idea was to make use of reordering summation. The coefficients $c_k$ can be seen as rowsums of the following matrix: $\qquad \small  
\begin{array} {rrrrr}
 1 & . & . & . & . & . &\ldots\\
 -3 & 1 & . & . & . & . \\
 6 & -3 & 1 & . & . & . \\
 -10 & 6 & -3 & 1 & . & . \\
 15 & -10 & 6 & -3 & 1 & . \\
 -21 & 15 & -10 & 6 & -3 & 1 & \ldots \\
 ... & ... \\
 \end{array}
$ so that all columns evaluate to $1/8$ due to the Abel-summation. If I add all that columnsums, I should have to write $\zeta(0)*1/8 $ and evaluate $T=-1/16$ (Q&D) now. But this is all fumbling, because I not even reflect the infinite application of downshifting by rows when evaluating the columns... [update2]: Hmm. I played with the reciprocals of the series. I just did the ""paper&pen"" divisions and got: $ \small \qquad \qquad 1 \qquad : 1-3x+6x^2-10x^3+15x^4-21x^5+...-...=1+3x+3x^2+1x^3=(1+x)^3=|_{x=1}8 $ and $ \small \qquad \qquad 1 \qquad : 1-2x+4x^2-6x^3+9x^4-12x^5+...-...=1+2x-2x^3-1x^4=(1+x)^3(1-x)=|_{x=1}0 $ So this is also immediately what Lubos pointed out.

41303,Examples and further results about the order of the product of two elements in a group,"Let $G$ be a group and let $a,b$ be two elements of $G$. What can we say about the order of their product $ab$? Wikipedia says ""not much"": There is no general formula relating the order of a product $ab$ to the orders of $a$ and $b$. In fact, it is possible that both $a$ and $b$ have finite order while $ab$ has infinite order, or that both $a$ and $b$ have infinite order while $ab$ has finite order. On the other hand no examples are provided. $(\mathbb{Z},+), 1$ and $-1$ give an example of elements of infinite order with product of finite order. I can't think of any example of the other kind! So: What's an example of a group $G$ and two elements $a,b$ both of finite order such that their product has infinite order? Wikipedia then states: If $ab = ba$, we can at least say that $\mathrm{ord}(ab)$ divides $\mathrm{lcm}(\mathrm{ord}(a), \mathrm{ord}(b))$ which is easy to prove, but not very effective.

Defining $\bar\phi$ on $\bar A$ by the pointwise limit of $\phi_n$ it seems to me, $\bar\phi$ should be continuous on $\bar A$ but I cannot bring a proof together. My idea: I have already proven, that for any finite set $B\subset \bar A$ the function $\bar\phi$ is continuous on $B\cup A$, and I was now trying to extend this to the entire $\bar A$ with Zorn's Lemma, but showing that, if $A\subset B_1\subset B_2 \subset \dots\subset \bar A$ and $\bar\phi$ is continuous on each $B_k$ then it is also on $\bigcup B_k$, is making some problems.

41317,Is compactness a stronger form of continuity?,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. We say that a linear operator $T \colon H \to H$ is compact if it maps bounded sets to precompact ones, that is, if for every bounded sequence $(a_n)$ in $H$, $(Ta_n)$ has got a convergent subsequence. We can characterize compactness in terms of weak convergence: $T$ is compact if and only if it maps weakly convergent sequences into norm convergent ones. Up to now I would have casually said: $T$ is compact iff $T$ is continuous
  when its domain is equipped with weak
  topology and its range with norm
  topology. and I would not have been alone: I've heard this from more than one of my professors. Well, this turns out to be false , as I read on Problem VI.34 of Reed & Simon's Methods of modern mathematical physics : Show that in a Hilbert space $H$, a map $T \colon H \to H$ is continuous when its domain is given the weak topology and its range the norm topology if and only if $T$ has finite rank!

At the moment this problem is beyond my grasp, since I know almost nothing of the necessary topological tools (that is - nets, Moore-Smith convergence, and the like).

41318,Probability of achieving a given density of IID random variables,"I have a sequence of IID random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$.

I'm trying to find the probability, given constants $\tau > 0$ and $b < n$, that there exists an interval of length $\tau$ which contains at least $b$ of the $n$ random variables. My first approach was to use order statistics; for example, if $X_{(1)}, X_{(2)}, \dots, X_{(n)}$ are the order statistics, the probability that the $b$ smallest fall in an interval of length $\tau$ could be found using the joint distribution of $X_{(1)}$ and $X_{(b)}$. From the Wikipedia article , $f_{X_{(j)},X_{(k)}}(x,y)dx\,dy=n!{[F_X(x)]^{j-1}\over(j-1)!}{[F_X(y)-F_X(x)]^{k-1-j}\over(k-1-j)!}{[1-F_X(y)]^{n-k}\over(n-k)!}f_X(x)f_X(y)\,dx\,dy$ This could then be integrated over the simplex $0 \leq x \leq y \leq x + \tau$, and the result could be repeated for each group of $b$ random variables and summed. However, I feel that this approach leads to double counting (for example, both $X_{(1)} \dots X_{(b)}$ and $X_{(n-b+1)} \dots X_{(n)}$ could fall in disjoint intervals of length $\tau$) and also seems to be difficult to obtain in closed form. The other approach I considered was to use the joint density of all order statistics: $f_{X_{(1)},\ldots,X_{(n)}}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\,dx_1\cdots dx_n=n!f_X(x_1)\cdots f_X(x_n)\,dx_1\cdots dx_n$ However, I can't determine how to express the region of integration in any meaningful way.

What bothers me is that all the sources I can Google (for ""Pettis integral"") seem to assume that $y$ exists (or put strong conditions, e.g. continuity, on $f$).  My guess is that a Hilbert space is sufficiently nice that I can somehow prove that $y$ exists (equivalently, that $F$ is continuous).

41462,$\sigma$-algebra of well-approximated Borel sets,"I somehow got stuck on the following line in Oxtoby :
""The class of Borel sets that have an $F_\sigma$ subset and a $G_\delta$
superset of equal measure is a $\sigma$-algebra that includes all
closed sets."" We work here with a Borel measure (=measure defined for all Borel sets) on a metric space. I have problems with showing that $$\mathcal S=\{A\subseteq X; (\exists F\subseteq A\subseteq G) \mu(G\setminus F)=0, F\text{ is }F_\sigma, G\text{ is }G_\delta\}$$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. As Oxtoby devotes only one grammatical sentence to this claim, I guess it should be relatively easy and I am overlooking some more straightforward approach. What I tried so far: Complements : $F\subseteq A\subseteq G$ $\Rightarrow$ $X\setminus G\subseteq X\setminus A\subseteq X\setminus F$. Finite intersections : Let $F_1\subseteq A\subseteq G_1$, $F_2\subseteq B\subseteq G_2$ and $\mu(G_1\setminus F_1)=\mu(G_2\setminus F_2)=0$. Then
$F_1\cap F_2\subseteq A\cap B\subseteq G_1\cap G_2$ and $$G_1\cap G_2\setminus F_1\cap F_2 = (G_1\cap G_2\setminus F_1)\cup (G_1\cap G_2\setminus F_2)\subseteq$$ $$\subseteq (G_1\setminus F_1)\cup(G_2\setminus F_2),$$ hence $\mu(G_1\cap G_2\setminus F_1\cap F_2)=0$. (Also, $G_1\cap G_2$ is $G_\delta$ and $F_1\cap F_2$ is $F_\sigma$.) Using finite intersections and complements, we can show that $\mathcal S$ is closed under differences of pairs of sets. Disjoint countable unions : Let $F_i\subseteq A_i \subseteq G_i$, where $A_i$'s are disjoint measurable sets. Then also $A_i\subseteq G_i\setminus \bigcup\limits_{n\ne i}F_n=: G_i'$ and $G_i'$'s are disjoint $G_\delta$-sets. Thus we get $$\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty G'_i$$ and $\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i)=\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty G'_i)$. But I do not know whether disjoint union of $G_\delta$ sets is again a $G_\delta$-set. EDIT 2 : As shown by Theo in the answer bellow, it is not true in general. Using differences and disjoint countable unions, I could get arbitrary countable unions . I also tried to prove that $\mathcal S$ is closed under countable intersections directly from the definition $\mathcal S$, but in that proof I obtained a  countable intersection of $F_\sigma$-sets, which is not necessarily $F_\sigma$. EDIT : Based on Theo's suggestion: There are several equivalent characterizations of $\mathcal S$: $$\mathcal S=\{A\subseteq X; (\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists V\subseteq A\subseteq U) \mu(U\setminus V)<\varepsilon, V\text{ is close}, U\text{ is open}\}$$ $$\mathcal S=\{A\subseteq X; (\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists F\subseteq A\subseteq U) \mu(U\setminus F)<\varepsilon, F\text{ is }F_\sigma, U\text{ is open}\}$$ Now I can modify the above construction to work for any countable union . For a system $\{A_i; i\in\mathbb N\}$ of sets from $\mathcal S$ I choose
$F_i\subseteq A_i \subseteq U_i$ such that $\mu(U_i\setminus F_i)<\varepsilon.2^{-i}$, $U_i$ is open, $F_i$ is $F_\sigma$.
Let $U:=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i$ and $F:=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i$. Then $U$ is open, $F$ is $F_\sigma$ and $$U\setminus F= (\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i) \setminus (\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i) \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (U_i\setminus F_i),$$ hence $\mu(U\setminus F)<\varepsilon$. We also have $$F=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i=U,$$ which implies $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\in \mathcal S$.",['measure-theory']

I took the modulus as below, $$\lvert-\dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{\sqrt3}{2}i \rvert = \sqrt{(\dfrac{-1}{2})^2 + (\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2})^2} = 1$$ And the argument as below, $$arg(-\dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{\sqrt3}{2}i) = \tan^{-1} (\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2} \times \dfrac{-2}{1}) = -60 = -\dfrac{\pi}{3}$$ Hence the complex number in polar form is, $$-\cos \dfrac{\pi}{3} + i \sin \dfrac{\pi}{3}$$ But, The required answer is $$\cos \dfrac{2\pi}{3} + i \sin \dfrac{2\pi}{3}$$ I thought of converting the -60 to positive, as 360 - 60 = 300, ie:- $$\dfrac{5\pi}{3}$$. I have a feeling I am missing something important. Can you guys tell me where I am going wrong? Thanks for all your help!","['trigonometry', 'complex-numbers', 'algebra-precalculus']"

41494,Removing countable hyperplanes from a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"I would like to claim that an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be covered by a
countable collection of $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplanes, that in fact excluding
the hyperplanes from the ball still leaves a set that contains an
uncountable number of points.
For $n=2$, this says removing a countable number of lines from a disk
still leaves an uncountable number of points of the disk.
What is the correct language to justify this?  It's a bit out of my expertise... Thanks for suggestions!",['general-topology']
41499,Dissecting a square into congruent pieces that all touch the centre,"Edited for clarity: I thought I had a complete set of solutions to this: Cut a square into identical pieces so that they all touch the center point. It became clear, after some discussions, that I was very, very wrong. There are infinite families of solutions, and a sporadic. So I have two questions: What do you think is a complete set of solutions? What techniques and approaches can I use to prove that the ones I have are all there are? I hope that's clearer. Thanks.","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'combinatorics']"
41500,Normal + Connected -> Uncountable,"Here's a solution (to the exercise ""prove that if $X$ is a space with more than one element, and is normal and connected then $X$ is uncountable""): by Urysohn's lemma, given $A$ and $B$, closed and disjoint in $X$, there exists a continuous function from $X$ into $[0,1]$ such that $f(A)={0}, f(B)={1}$. If $X$ were countable, so it would be $f(X)\subset [0,1]$; choose $r\in (0,1)\setminus f(X)$, then $X=f^{-1}([0,r))\cup f^{-1}((r,1])$, so $X$ is disconnected. But the full power of the lemma wasn't used, all that was used is that there exists a continuous function $X\longrightarrow [0,1]$, so the condition of being normal seems too much. So my question is, what are the weakest conditions on $X$ for the existence of such continuous functions into $[0,1]$ (or $\mathbb{R}$, for that matter)?",['general-topology']
41505,Questions about generating non-biased random natural number,"A. Several years before, I was solving some problems, and one of problems was something like Explain how you can get non-biased random natural numbers between 1~10, with a six-sided(normal) dice. I found the solution easily, but I was quite unhappy, because my solution included re-throwing, like this: Throw dice until numbers between 1~5 appears . I thought about the solution that doesn't require re-throwing, but I couldn't find one. B. I saw a programming puzzle about fixing broken random number in Programming Puzzles & Code Golf. The problem was: Given a function that returns 2 (probability:80%) or 5(probability:20%) randomly, make a program that returns random natural numbers between 1~5 evenly. Algorithms used in answers were quite interesting, but all answers required for or while loop which can be looped infinitely. I found this post in SO saying that there's no correct solution to expend the range of random from 1~5 to 1~7 that doesn't require any loop, because 1/7 is an infinite decimal in base 5. Using same strategy, there's no solution to the problem in A that doesn't requires re-throwing. However, I don't get it - why the fact that 1/10 is an infinite decimal in base 6 results in that conclusion? It does seem that two things are related, but I have no idea how they're actually related. Maybe there's some clever algorithm, like adding many random numbers and divide into 10 cases, considering about discrete probability distribution. And, I'm curious that whether the puzzle in B can be solved without using any loops, and whether this problem is related to the problem in A. So, my questions are Why there's no solution of the problem in A that doesn't require re-throwing? Is there any answer of the puzzle in B that doesn't require any loops ? Are above two questions are related ?","['probability-theory', 'random-functions', 'discrete-mathematics']"

41534,Is it possible for the Lagrange multiplier to be equal to zero?,"I would like to find the extrema of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+4xy+4y^2$ subject to $x^2+2y^2=4$ using Lagrange Multipliers. Is it possible to get for the Lagrange multipliers the value zero? I don't think so because the gradient vectors for $f$ and $g(x,y)=x^2+2y^2$ have to be proportional. So this problem has two solutions. But their image by the function $f$ is the same. So, how can I know if they correspond to a maximum or to a minimum?","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'functions', 'lagrange-multiplier']"
41536,Intuitive explanation of the tower property of conditional expectation,"I understand how to define conditional expectation and how to prove that it exists. Further, I think I understand what conditional expectation means intuitively. I can also prove the tower property, that is if $X$ and $Y$ are random variables (or $Y$ a $\sigma$-field) then we have that $$\mathbb E[X] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb E [X | Y]].$$ My question is: What is the intuitive meaning of this? It seems quite puzzling to me. (I could find similar questions but not this one.)","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'intuition', 'probability']"
41551,Global invertibility of a map $\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ from everywhere local invertibility,"I was told by a tutor that if $f: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ has an invertible Jacobian Matrix for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\lim_{|x_k| \rightarrow \infty}|f(x_k)|=\infty$ for all such sequences, then $f$ is already globally bijective. This was very surprising for me (as this seems to be a very strong statement), so I tried to search on the internet for this theorem but I only came up with theorems about local inverses. I hope someone here can give me a reference or a name of this theorem so I could read a detailed proof. I sanity checked it for $n=1$ where it works perfectly.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

41555,Car movement - differential geometry interpretation,"The problem presented below is from my differential geometry course. The initial reference is Nelson, Tensor Analysis 1967. The car is modelled as follows: Denote by $C(x,y)$ the center of the back wheel line, $\theta$ the angle of the direction of the car with the horizontal direction, $\phi$ the angle made by the front wheels with the direction of the car and $L$ the length of the car. The possible movements of the car are denoted as follows: steering: $S=\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$; drive: $D=\displaystyle\cos \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\sin\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac{\tan \phi}{L}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$; rotation: $R=[S,D]=\displaystyle\frac{1}{L\cos^2 \phi}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}$; translation: $T=[R,D]=\displaystyle\frac{\cos \theta}{L\cos^2 \phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-\frac{\sin\theta}{L\cos^2\phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ Where $[X,Y]=XY-YX$ (I can't remember the English word now). All these transformations seem very logical. My question is: How can we justify the mathematical interpretation made above, especially the part with the rotations and translations? The interpretations are quite interesting: from the expression of $D$, when the car is shorter, you can change the orientation of the car very easily, but when it is longer, like a truck, you it is not that easy ( see the term with $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$) the rotation is faster for smaller cars, and for greater steering angle translation is easier for smaller cars.","['classical-mechanics', 'differential-geometry']"
