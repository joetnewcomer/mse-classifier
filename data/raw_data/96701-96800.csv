1332879,conditional probability combining discrete and continous random variables,"Let us define $Y$ a continuous random variable having  density $f(y,\theta)$ and X a discrete random variable such that $X=\mathbf{1}_{ \{Y \in [a_{i-1}, a_{i}) \}}$ .

1332943,"Prove that if function f is monotonic, then it one-to-one","What I have so far: Suppose $f$ is monotonic. It is therefore either increasing or decreasing. Proof for increasing: If $f$ is increasing, then $f(x_1) <f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$, which means $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ if, and only if, $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore $f$ is one to one.

1332945,Theorema egregium violated in dimension $n \ge 4$?,"Gauß showed that for surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ the Gaussian curvature ( = sectional curvature) is invariant under local isometries. This is known as the thema egregium. Now in another question ( click me ) I defined i.e. $3$ types of spaces: 1.) Locally symmetric spaces. They were Riemannian manifolds with the property that $\nabla R=0$ everywhere. 2.) Symmetric spaces. They were path-conn. Riemannian manifolds such that there is for each $p \in M$ a global isometry $f_p: M \rightarrow M$ such that $f(\gamma(t)) = f(\gamma(-t))$ for all geodesics $\gamma: (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \rightarrow M$ satisfying $\gamma(0)=p$ and $Df_p(p) = -id.$ 3.) Homogenous spaces. They were spaces admitting for every $p,q\in M$ a global isometry $\phi_{p,q}: M \rightarrow M$ such that $\phi(p)=q$ and as it turned out, although all of them have some kind of isometries, they don't have to have constant curvature at all ( as I was told in the answer I got or rather in the comments below the answer in the previously linked thread.) Now, I want to understand whether this means that the Theorema egregium is wrong in dimension $n \ge 4$ or whether I am missing something here? I mean especially the condition we have for homogenous spaces looks like something that should preserve sectional curvature, but it does apparently not.
Homogenous spaces admit global isometries between any two points. Why doesn't this mean that the curvature tensor is the same for these two points and is therefore constant on the homogenous space?

1333054,Consensus division of a cake,"There is a pie and two people with different tastes. The goal is to cut a piece, using two radial cuts like this: such that both people agree that the piece has a value of exactly a fraction $p$ of the total, where $p\in[0,1]$ is a given constant. Formally, the pie is described as the interval $[0,1]$ whose two endpoints are identified (- a topological circle). There are two non-negative value measures over the interval, $V_A$ and $V_B$. They are absolutely continuous with respect to length (this means that they are non-atomic). Both measures assign the same value to the whole interval: $V_A([0,1])=V_B([0,1])=1$. The goal is to find an interval $[x,y]$ such that $V_A([x,y])=V_B([x,y])=p$. I found a solution for the special case in which the measure $V_A$ is equal to the length measure. Here it is. Hold two knives over the pie, such that the distance between them is exactly $p$. Move the knives a whole round around the pie, always keeping the distance between them at $p$. I claim that there is a point in which $V_B$ of the piece between the knives is exactly $p$. PROOF: At each time $t\in[0,1]$, the piece between the knives is $[t,t+p]$. Mark by $S$, the sum of the values of $V_B$ when the knives make a whole round: $$ S = \int_{t=0}^1 V_B([t,t+p]) dt $$ Since $V_B$ is continuous, it has a derivative $v_b$, such that $V_B([t,t+p])=\int_{x=t}^{t+p} v_b(x)dx$. So: $$ S = \int_{t=0}^1 \int_{x=t}^{t+p} v_b(x)dx dt = \int_{t=0}^1 \int_{x=0}^{p} v_b(t+x)dx dt $$ Substitute the order of integration and get: $$ S = \int_{x=0}^{p} \int_{t=0}^1 v_b(t+x) dt dx = \int_{x=0}^{p} 1 dx = p$$ The integral of $V_B([t,t+p])$ equals $p$ and the functions are continuous, so by the Mean Value Theorem there must be a  $t$ in which $V_B([t,t+p])=p$. $\square$ Is it possible to generalize this argument to arbitrary continuous value measures? EDIT: I just thought of an informal idea. Let $N$ be a large integer. Normalize the value measures such that the value of the entire cake for each person is $N^2$. Divide the cake to $N$ arcs such that, in each arc, $V_A+V_B=2N$. Additionally, round the values of $V_A$ and $V_B$ in each arc to the nearest integers. Now, we have a discrete problem. We can imagine that in each arc, there are $V_A$ Azure balls and $V_B$ Black balls. Move two knives around the cake in the following way. In each step $t$, knife #1 is just before Azure ball $t$, and knife #2 is just before Azure ball $t + p N^2$. Hence the number of Azure balls between the knives is always $p N^2$. Move the knives until the knives return to their original location. At each step, count the number of Black balls between the knives, and sum over the entire round-trip.  Each black ball is counted whenever there are between 1 and $p N^2$ azure balls before it. Hence, it is counted exactly $p N^2$ times. Hence, the sum of the counts over the entire trip is $p N^4$. This is a fraction $p$ of the product of the total number of balls. An interactive illustration is available here: http://tube.geogebra.org/m/1355529 There, $p N^2 = 5$. The green arc is the arc between the knives. You can increase $t$ and see that the green arc always covers exactly 5 azure balls, and each black ball is covered exactly 5 times. When $N$ is sufficiently large, the sum becomes an integral, and by continuity, the integral of the $V_B$ is $p$. Hence, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point in the trip in which $V_B=p$. Can this idea be made formal?","['fair-division', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1333088,Polya's random walk and gambler's ruin: interpretation in higher dimensions,"I've read that Polya coined the term ""Random Walk."" He analyzed the 1-dimension example and proved that the chances of returning to any point on the line is ultimately 100%. This is how one can think of a gambler's ruin: a person playing a fair random game against a casino will eventually lose all his money. Now, Polya also showed that this scheme breaks down in higher dimensions. For instance, in the 3 dimensional lattice, the player has a lower chance of going back to its starting point (0.34, although I realized in my research that there is no closed form answer for higher dimensions). Question: how can we understand the gambler analogy in the context of Polya's higher dimension examples? Does the case for the 3-dimensional lattice mean that for example somehow playing in 3 casinos with 3 different currencies lowers the risk of ruin? p.s. This is not for gambling.

1333361,Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure and $\sup_n \int |f_n|^{1+\epsilon} \ d\mu<\infty$ for some $\epsilon$. Prove that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable,"Problem Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure and $\sup_n \int |f_n|^{1+\epsilon} \ d\mu<\infty$ for some $\epsilon>0$. Prove that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable. Background A family $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $M$ such that $$\int_{\{x: |f_n(x)|>M\}} |f_n(x) d\mu<\epsilon$$ for each $n$. Along with the usual limit theorems (Monotone Convergence, LDCT, Fatou's Lemma), the following is also known: Theorem (Vitali): Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure. If $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e., and $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable, then $\int |f_n -f| \rightarrow 0.$ On the other hand, if $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e., each $f_n$ is integrable, $f$ is integrable, and $\int |f_n-f| \rightarrow 0$, then $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable. Attempt Let $E=\{x: |f_n|\geq 1\}$ and $m\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{m}<\epsilon$.  Then $|f_n|^{1+1/n}\leq |f_n|^{1+\epsilon}$ for all $x \in E$ and $k\geq M$. Consequently,
\begin{align*}
\int_E |f_n|^{1+1/k} \ d\mu &\leq \int_E |f_n|^{1+\epsilon} \ d\mu \\
&\leq \sup_n \int_E |f_n|^{1+\epsilon}\\
&<\infty.
\end{align*}
Thus, since $|f_n|^{1+1/k} \rightarrow |f_n|$ on $E$ we see by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem that $\int_E |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_E|f_n|\ d\mu.$ Furthermore, on $E^c,$  $$|f_n|^{1+1/n}\leq |f_n|< 1$$ so by the monotone convergence theorem we have $\int_{E^c} |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_{E^c}|f_n| \ d\mu$. Combining these two facts we see that $$\int |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_{E^c}|f_n| \ d\mu$$ and by the theorem above, $\{|f_n|^{1+1/k}\}$ is uniformly integrable. Since $\{|f_n|\}\subset \{|f_n|^{1+1/k}\}$, we have the result. Remarks This feels horribly wrong but I can't seem to put a dent in this problem any other way.","['proof-verification', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

Then when we have ramification, say $P = Q^e \prod Q_i$, the $Q_i$ remain as expected in the covering, but we have a degeneration at $Q$ giving us $e$ layers collapsing into just one above $P$, like in the case of Riemann surfaces. So my question is: using this type of geometric analogy, where is the inertia hiding? I don't yet have enough background to understand etale morphisms yet, but I've heard that these give a nice analogue of covering maps in this kind of setting. Is there some concrete way I can try to build intuition about first? Maybe is there a way to interpret the residue field extension $k_Q/k_P$ using a corresponding unramified extension of the local fields $L_Q/K_P$ and give a uniform way of looking at this ""covering"" interpretation so that only ramification really feels like the ""bad"" points where we have less than expected cardinality of the fibers?","['intuition', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'soft-question']"

It will suffice to prove that $f^{(n)}=0$ for all $n \geq 3$ Let there be a circle $C_R$ with radius $R$ centered at $z=0$. So by the general Cauchy Integral Formula we get that: $$f^{(n)}(0)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}}dz$$ So we know that $$|f^{(n)}(0)|=|\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}\frac{f(z)}{z^{n+1}}dz| \leq \frac{n!}{2\pi} \cdot Length(C_R) \cdot \max _{z \in C_R} \frac{1}{|z^{n+1}|} \cdot  \max _{z \in C_R}|f(z)|=\\ =\frac{n!}{2\pi} \cdot 2 \pi R \cdot \frac {1}{R^{n+1}} \cdot \max _{z \in C_R}|f(z)|=n! \frac {|z|^2+12}{R^n} \leq n!\frac {R^2+12}{R^n} $$ So when $R \rightarrow \infty$, for $n \geq 3$ we get $|f^{(n)}(0)| \leq 0$ hence $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for $n \geq 3$, hence QED.

If this helps, one can assume that the functions $f$ and $g$ are smooth, or polynomials, and/or that their sign is constant in a neighbourhood of $0$.

Heuristically, is it correct to say that a Cartesian coordinate system is ""Euclidean geometry with coordinates"" and so by definition the geometry that we are studying has to be Euclidean (i.e. Euclidean metric, parallel postulate, etc. must hold) in order to use this coordinate system. Also, more mathematically, is it correct to say that a Cartesian coordinate system is a special kind of mapping between points of Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ and real space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Such a coordinate map makes the intrinsic spatial distance between two points in $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ be directly reflected by the ‘numerical distance’ between their numerical coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. If this is correct then I can understand why Cartesian coordinate maps cannot generally be used for patches on manifolds as the geometry will generally be non-Euclidean. As such the homeomorphisms (coordinate maps) from the patch on the manifold to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ will necessarily deform the patch, consequently intrinsic distances between points, angles, etc. will not preserved and so Cartesian coordinates cannot be used.","['coordinate-systems', 'geometry', 'manifolds', 'analytic-geometry']"

1334071,The Pullback Bundle is an Embedded Submanifold of its Parent Space,"$\newcommand{\mc}{\mathcal} \newcommand{\set}[1]{\{#1\}} \DeclareMathOperator{\pr}{pr} \newcommand{\at}{\big|} \DeclareMathOperator{\GL}{GL}$ Let $\pi:E\to N$ be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold $N$ with typical fibre a $k$-dimensional vector space $\mc V$ and $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. Is it true that the total space of the pullback bundle $\Pi:f^*E\to M$ is an embedded submanifold of $M\times E$? (For reference, I have described the pullback construction I below). I think the above is true. It is clear that $f^*E$ has the subspace topology induced from $M\times E$. So we only need to check that the inclusion map is a smooth immersion. When passing to charts, this is equivalent to checking that the map $(m, v)\mapsto (m, f(m), v):f^{-1}(U)\times \mc V\to f^{-1}(U)\times U\times \mc V$ is an immersion, where $U$ is an open set in $N$ over which $E$ trivializes. But this is indeed an immersion. If the assertion is correct, then to check if a map $g:Q\to f^*E$ is smooth, we would just need to check if $\pr_1\circ g$ and $\pr_2\circ g$ are smooth (and this was the motivation for the question). Thanks. Pullback Bundle Construction: Let $\pi:E\to N$ be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold $N$ with typical fibre a $k$-dimensional vector space $\mc V$ and $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. Define the set $f^*E=M\times_N E=\set{(p, x)\in M\times E:\ f(p)=\pi(x)}$.
Define $\Pi:f^*E\to M$ as the restriction of $\pr_1:M\times E\to M$ to $M\times_N E$.
We will write $(f^*E)_p$ to denote $\Pi^{-1}(p)$ for each $p\in M$. Now for each smooth local trivialization $\phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times \mc V$ of $E$ over $U$, define a map $\Phi:\Pi^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))\to f^{-1}(U)\times \mc V$ as $\Phi(p, v)=(p, \pr_2\circ \phi(v))$ and note that $\Phi$ is a bijection whose restriction to $\Pi^{-1}(p)$ is a linear isomorphism from $(f^*E)_p$ to $\set{p}\times \mc V$ for each $p\in f^{-1}(U)$.
For each $q\in U$, write $\phi_q$ to mean $\pr_2\circ \phi\at_{E_q}$ and note that $\phi_q:E_q\to \mc V$ is a linear isomorphism. Let $\phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times \mc V$ and $\psi:\pi^{-1}(V)\to V\times \mc V$ be two overlapping smooth local trivializations of $U$ and $V$ over $V$ and $\Phi:\Pi^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))\to f^{-1}(U)\times \mc V$ and $\Phi:\Pi^{-1}(f^{-1}(V))\to f^{-1}(V)\times \mc V$ be the corresponding bijections.
If $\tau:U\times V\to \GL(\mc V)$ is the transition function associated with $\psi\circ \phi^{-1}$, then note that $\Psi\circ \Phi^{-1}:f^{-1}(U\cap V)\times \mc V\to f^{-1}(U\cap V)\times \mc V$ is given by \begin{equation*}
	\Psi\circ \Phi^{-1}(p, v)=(p, \tau_{f(p)}v)
\end{equation*}
for all $(p, v)\in (U\cap V)\times \mc V$.
Defining $\Gamma:f^{-1}(U\cap V)\to \GL(\mc V)$ as $\Gamma=\tau\circ f$ we see that
%equation
\begin{equation*}
	\Psi\circ\Phi^{-1}(p, v) = (p, \Gamma_p(v))
\end{equation*}
for all $(p, v)\in f^{-1}(U\cap V)\times \mc V$.
It is clear that $\Gamma$ is smooth.
Therefore there is a unique topology and smooth structure such that $\Pi:f^*E\to M$ is smooth vector bundle with typical fibre $\mc V$ whose smooth local trivializations are the maps $\Phi:f^{-1}(U)\to U\times \mc V$ as defined above.","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'vector-bundles']"

1334103,Theoretical function question,"Suppose we have the function $f(x)= x^2 $. This function associates real numbers with real numbers ( $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$). Now, what i get confused sometimes is what exactly the function is. Sometimes textbooks compares functions with a machine that have raw material / inputs (in this case the real numbers) and then processes it into an output (which can be any number in the codomain). So, what I get confused is: the function is the operator (in this example raising to a power) or the general concept of 'transforming' a number? Like, if we use another example $f(x)= x + 2 $, is the function an operator (the addition), a process that transforms number or something else more general and the operator is part of the function, only an association of numbers from the domain to the codomain?","['elementary-set-theory', 'definition', 'functions']"

1334153,A norm which is symmetric enough is induced by an inner product?,"$\newcommand{\<}{\langle} \newcommand{\>}{\rangle} $ It is a fact that for every norm $\| \|$ on a finite dimensional (real) vector  space, its isometry group $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)$ is contained in some isometry group of a suitable inner product. ( see this question ). Now assume we have a norm $\| \|$ such that $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)=\text{ISO}(\<,\>)$ for some inner product. Is $\| \|$ necessarily induced by an inner product? Update: The answer is yes. The key fact is the transitivity of the isometry group.
Actually, as pointed out in this question in MO , the following statement is true: Let $X$ be finite-dimensional normed space whose isometry group acts transitively on the unit sphere (i.e, for every two unit-norm vectors $x,y∈X$ there exist a linear isometry from $(X, \| \|)$ to itself that sends $x$ to y). Then X is a Euclidean space (i.e., the norm comes from a scalar product). The proof is decomposed of two steps: (1) showing there exists an inner product $\< ,\>$ whose isometry group $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)\subseteq \text{ISO}(\<,\>)$. The basic idea is this: $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)$ is compact, hence it admits an invariant probability measure, hence (by an averaging argument) there exists a Euclidean structure preserved by it. ( The details can be found here ). (2) The transitivity of $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)$ together with (1) impliy that the original norm is proportional to that Euclidean norm.","['isometry', 'inner-products', 'metric-geometry', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"
1334156,"Is there an analytic function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}\setminus[-1,1]$ that satisfies $e^{f(z)}=\frac{z+1}{z-1}$?","I'm having trouble proving or disproving this question. I kind of expect that there is no such function since the definition of the logarithm of a function $\phi$ that is analytic on a simply connected open set $U$ is $$L_\phi(z)=\int^z_{z_0}\frac{\phi'(\zeta)}{\phi(\zeta)}d\zeta + w_0.$$ With $w_0$ being a complex number such that $e^{w_0}=f(z_0)$. But in our case we are looking for an analytic function on $\mathbb{C}\setminus[-1,1]$ which is not simply connected. But on the other hand if I let $\phi(z)=\frac{z+1}{z-1}$ and $\gamma$ be a path in $\mathbb{C}\setminus[-1,1]$ from $z_0$ to $z$ and define $f(z)=L_\gamma\phi(z)$ as $$L_\gamma\phi(z)=\int^z_{z_0,\gamma}\frac{\phi'(\zeta)}{\phi(\zeta)}d\zeta + w_0.$$ Then for any two different paths in $\mathbb{C}\setminus[-1,1]$ connecting $z_0$ and $z$ the results of $f(z)$ will differ by an integer multiple of $2\pi i$. So even though $f$ may not be well defined the exponential of $f$ is well defined since $$e^{L_{\gamma_1}\phi(z)}=e^{L_{\gamma_2}\phi(z)+m2\pi i}=\phi(z)=\frac{z+1}{z-1}.$$ These have been my attempts so far, but I am not sure if I am on the right track or completely missing something.",['complex-analysis']

1334274,Identifying semidirect products-groups of order 28,"So, I'm very new to working with semi-direct products.  I'm working on my algebra qual prep, and one of the questions was to identify all the groups of order 28.  I'm pretty sure I have the answer...the only problem is I'm not sure just what two of the groups look like! So,  starting with the sylow subgroups, I have that $n_2|7$ and $2|(n_2-1)$,  so we have $n_2=1$ or $n_2=7$.  Similarly, $n_7|4$ and $7|(n_7-1)$, so $n_7=1$, thus the Sylow 7 subgroup is unique, and therefore normal,  hence our group G is a semidirect product of its Sylow 2 subgroup and its sylow 7 subgroup. The two possibilities for the Sylow 2 subgroup are $\mathbb Z _2 \times \mathbb Z _2$ or $\mathbb Z_4$.  Neither are eliminated by a counting argument.  So, I'm looking for homomorphisms from the sylow 2 subgroup to the automorphism group of the sylow 7 subgroup, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_6$ Case 1:  The sylow 2 subgroup is $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$.  The generators are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$.  These each have order 2, so the images must have order $1$ or $2$. So the images are either $0$ or $3$.  If the images of both are $0$, we have the trivial homomorphism, so this is actually a direct product and we have the abelian group $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_7$
Now, say $(1,0)$ goes to $3$ and $(0,1)$ goes to $0$.  Then $(1,1)$ goes to 3.  Similarly, we have as a case $(0,1)\to 3,(1,0)\to 0,(1,1)\to 3$ and $(1,0)\to 3,(0,1)\to 3,(1,1)\to 0$.  All of these are identical up to isomorphism as they send 2 indistinguishable elements to the same thing and the other to the identity, so up to isomorphism there is only one such semidirect product... Here's where I'm stuck, I don't know what this group is, what it looks like!  How do I figure that out? Case 2: The sylow 2 subgroup is $\mathbb Z_4$. Here we just have one generator, $1$, and it can go to either $0$ or $3$ as above.  If $0$ we have the abelian case.

1334480,When does $f\sim g$ implies $f'\sim g'$?,"Given two $C^1$ functions $f,g:[0,+\infty)\to [0,+\infty)$ such that $f(x)\sim g(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, which good conditions guarantee that $f'(x)\sim g'(x)$? I thought that monotonicity of the derivatives could be such condition, but I wasn't able to prove or disprove. I think that one such condition can be $f$, $f'$, $g$, $g'$, $f-g$ and $f'-g'$ to be monotonic increasing, but that's so restrictive that hurts. Also, if anyone could suggest a book that treats problems like that (I don't know, ""asymptotic analysis""?) I would appreciate. Thanks in advance.","['asymptotics', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1334514,Intuition behind generic point of a scheme?,"I've been reading a little about algebraic geometry and how there seems to have existed this notion of ""generic point"" on a variety which wasn't carefully defined at first. But often times, intuitively one would try to prove a statement at a generic point to get a statement about the overall variety. I suppose what I'm asking is: how can I understand the notion of a generic point in the most concrete sense? I know that $X = Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ has $(0)$ as a generic point because it's Zariski closure is all of $X$, but what does that say geometrically? Suppose I take $V = V(x^2 + y^2 - 1)$ over $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $Spec(\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1))$. Then $(0)$ is a generic point in the latter (because only maximal ideals correspond to the actual points of $V$, yes?). So how can I visualize this generic point when all I'm thinking about in my mind is the circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$? As an addendum, what sort of properties did geometers in the early 1900s observe a variety would possess if they could show its ""generic point"" had this property? (Just as a reference to see where this idea is even coming from, because it feels very unintuitive to me at the moment.) Is there some property about all the other rational primes we can deduce by proving something about $(0) \in Spec(\mathbb{Z})$?","['intuition', 'algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question']"

1334534,What's the smallest non-$p$ group that isn't a semidirect product?,"Although every non-simple group can be described as a group extension , it is well-known that not every non-simple group can be expressed as a semidirect product of smaller groups. For example, a cyclic group of order $p^2$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ by $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , but cannot be written as a semidirect product.  The quaternion group $Q_8$ is also not a semidirect product.  Indeed, this seems to be very common property for $p$ -groups. So my question is: What's the smallest non-simple group $G$ such that: $G$ isn't a $p$ -group, and $G$ can't be expressed as a semidirect product of smaller groups?","['semidirect-product', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups']"
1334544,off by 1 lottery probability,"A lottery, where 6 balls out of 50 are drawn randomly without replacement, allows players of the lottery to be off by at most 1 for each number on their lottery ticket.  Additional rules of the lottery are as follows: The balls are numbered 1 thru 50 and are all equally likely to be drawn. Both the winning numbers drawn and the players tickets contain random numbers (from 1 to 50).  That is, the player does not pick/choose their own numbers, it is done randomly for them via computer. Both the winning numbers and the numbers on lottery tickets are sorted in ascending order and winning tickets must match/map in that order.  For example, if the winning numbers drawn are (sorted) 5, 10, 15, 16, 20, and 30 and the ticketholder has 5, 10, 16, 17, 20, and 30 (also sorted), the 16s will not map together.  The matching numbers are (5:5), (10:10), (15:16), (16:17), (20:20), and (30:30).  That is a winning ticket. So the question is how much more likely is a single lottery ticket expected to be a winner using the off by 1 rule verses a similar but much stricter lottery (also 6 out of 50 balls) but which disallows the off by 1 rule (numbers must match exactly)? Work done so far: The strict lottery chances of winning on a single ticket are 1 in about 15.9 million which is 1 / (50 choose 6). The off by 1 lottery was simulated on computer and I am seeing a 503 increase in probability (about 1 in 31,600 chance of winning). I would like to know if this type of problem can be done mathematically or if it is too difficult.  Also, I was hoping someone could do a simulation also to help verify my finding of 503x increase in chances of winning. Additional info that may be helpful for analysis...  The worst case boost in expected win probability is 7x if (for example), the drawn balls are 1,2,3,4,5,6.  This would match the following tickets: (1,2,3,4,5,6), (1,2,3,4,5,7), (1,2,3,4,6,7), (1,2,3,5,6,7), (1,2,4,5,6,7), (1,3,4,5,6,7), and (2,3,4,5,6,7).  Best case boost is 729x where the drawn balls are something like 5, 10, 15, 20, 23, 30. The 3 most frequent boost scenarios (from simulation results) are 486x, 648x, and 729x.  These are 3 out of 137 scenarios I am seeing in simulation of 100,000,000 decisions. I am not yet sure if there more. If something is unclear, please ask before attempting to answer the question and I will clarify.",['probability']

Thus, the Integral becomes $$\int_0^{\pi/2} \ln\bigg(\dfrac{1+\cos(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)}\bigg)\dfrac{1}{\cos(\theta)}d\theta$$
$$=\int_0^{\pi/2} \ln\bigg(\cot^2\dfrac{\theta}{2}\bigg)\dfrac{1}{\cos(\theta)}d\theta$$

1334606,"Equality on pg. 40 of Humphreys's Lie Algebras, $\kappa(t_\lambda,t_\mu)=\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi}\alpha(t_\lambda)\alpha(t_\mu)$?","I don't understand part of an equality on page 40 of Humphreys's book on Lie Algebras. Suppose $L$ is a semi-simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, and $H$ a maximal toral subalgebra. Let $\kappa$ denote the Killing form, so for each $\phi\in H^\ast$, there is a unique $t_\phi\in H$ such that $\phi(h)=\kappa(t_\phi,h)$ for all $h\in H$. The equation says for any $\lambda,\mu\in H^\ast$, 
$$
\kappa(t_\lambda,t_\mu)=\sum\alpha(t_\lambda)\alpha(t_\mu)
$$
where the sum is over the set of roots $\alpha\in\Phi$. By definition of $t_\lambda$, $\kappa(t_\lambda,t_\mu)=\lambda(t_\mu)$, and since the roots span $H^\ast$, I can write $\lambda=\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi}c_\alpha\alpha$ for coefficients $c_\alpha$. Then
$$
\lambda(t_\mu)=\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi}c_\alpha\alpha(t_\mu)
$$
so this would work out if $c_\alpha=\alpha(t_\lambda)$. Is this true, or is there another way to see this?","['abstract-algebra', 'lie-algebras', 'representation-theory']"

1334619,Function that Represents Divergent Power Series?,"Suppose we have the following power series $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(x^2+1\right)^{2k}$$ If we wished to find the function that represents this series, it seems reasonable to suppose that the function $f$ that may represent this series is $$f(x) = \frac{1}{1-\left(x^2+1\right)^2} = -\frac{1}{x^2(x^2+2)}$$ which is defined over $\mathbb{R^*}$ However, since we are assuming that the power series is geometric, the summand must be less than 1; therefore, $$(x^2+1)^2<1$$ But this is absurd, since the $\min{x}=0$ renders the value 1. 
Therefore, the power series diverges. Here is my question : Since the power series diverges, does this mean that it cannot represent the function that we deduced above for all $x$, in which case, the series does not define $f$?","['power-series', 'functions']"
