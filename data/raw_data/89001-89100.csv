1189814,Example of a finitely generated faithful torsion module over a commutative ring,"Can a finitely generated module $M$ over a commutative ring have $\operatorname{Ann}(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in M$ while $\operatorname{Ann}(M) = 0$? It's not difficult to show that there is no such module if the ring is a integral domain. For general, I guess the answer is yes. But I failed to find a desired example.","['abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory']"
1189899,Showing these prime ideals are principal,"Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta)$ be a number field where $\theta$ has minimal polynomial $x^3-9x-6$. I had to factorise the ideals $(2)$ and $(3)$ into prime ideals, for which I got $(2) = (2,\theta)(2,\theta +1)^2$ and $(3) = (3,\theta)^3$ by using Dedekind's criterion. Then I am to show these prime ideals are principal. I'm a bit stuck at this point. The best I can think to do is to choose some element I might believe generates the whole ideal and show that we can obtain the generators from it. I've had a few guesses for only $(2,\theta)$ and I can't manage to get there. I imagine there is a better way to do this than to simply strike it lucky with a good guess. Is there a better way to proceed in finding a generator, or maybe some other method of showing the ideals are principal?","['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
1189914,Hartshorne III 9.5 confused about base extension.,"Hartshorne III Proposition 9.5 states: Let $f:X\to Y$ be a flat morphism of schemes of finite type over a field $k$.  For any point $x\in X$ let $y=f(x)$.  Then $$\dim_x(X_y)=\dim_x X-\dim_y Y$$ where for any scheme $X$, by $\dim_x X$ we mean the dimension of the local ring at $\mathcal{O}_{x,X}$. The proof involves several statements about base change which I am unable to understand.  First, making the base change $Y'\to Y$ where $Y'=\text{Spec } \mathcal{O}_{y,Y}$ we get $X'=X\times_Y Y'$ and $f':X'\to Y'$.  We lift $x$ to $X'$ and Hartshorne states ""the three numbers in question are the same.""  I do not understand at all why they would be the same, and unfortunately I don't understand base change very well either intuitively or from a technical perspective, so I don't really know how I would go about seeing this. Later on, a base extension is made to $Y_{\text{red}}$ and again ""nothing changes"" according to Hartshorne.  Also it is mentioned that the fibre $X_y$ does not change under base extension. Can someone help me understand these statements and why they should be so clear (but aren't)?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
1189924,Is it true that $\lim \limits_{x \to a} [l(x)-m(x)] = 0 \implies l(x)$ has the same sign of $m(x)$ for $x$ sufficiently close to $a$?,"This was present in a demonstration of a theorem, however, it didn't seem obvious to me. Is this a general result? Here is the exact context where this appeared (from Spivak's Calculus book): If f is function for which $f(a) =f'(a) = f''(a) = ... = f^{n-1}(a) = 0$ and $f^{n}(a) > 0$, then $f$ will have a local minimum at $x=a$ if $n$ is even. The demonstration uses a Taylor polynomial $$P_{n,a}(x) = \frac {f^{n}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$
as $$\lim\limits_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-P_{n,a}(x)}{(x-a)^n} =0$$ We would have $$\lim\limits_{x \to a} \left [ \frac{f(x)}{(x-a)^n} - \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} \right ] = 0$$ Which implies that $\frac{f(x)}{(x-a)^n}$ has the same sign as $\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$, for $x$ sufficiently close to $a$. As a consequence, $f(x)>0=f(a)$, because $f^{(n)}(a)>0$ and $(x-a)^n>0$, so there's a local minimum at $a$.","['power-series', 'calculus', 'limits']"

1189950,Topological Spaces and Topological Equivalence,"My professor gave us the following question while covering Topological Spaces Find a list of Topologies $\mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2,..., \mathcal{T}_n$ on $X=\{1,2,3\}$ such that for every topology $\mathcal{U}$ on $X$, $(X,\mathcal{U}) \equiv (X,\mathcal{T}_i)$ for some $i$, and $(X,\mathcal{T}_j) \not\equiv (X,\mathcal{T}_k)$ for all $j\neq k$. In this case '$\equiv$' refers to there being a homeomorphism, topological equivalent, from one topological space to the other. Now if I understand correctly, a topology is a family of subsets of $X$ satisfying the following condition. (1) $X,\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$, (2) The union of any family of members of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$, and (3) The intersection of any finite family of members of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$. Now for two spaces to be topological equivalent, there needs to be a one-to-one correspondence from $X$ to $Y$ for which both $f$ and the inverse function $f^{-1}$ are continuous. The list of Topologies on $X$ I have, so far, are as follows: $\mathcal{T}_1=\{\emptyset, X\}$ (The Trival Topology) $\mathcal{T}_2=\{\emptyset, X,\{1\}\}$ $\mathcal{T}_3=\{\emptyset, X,\{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$ $\mathcal{T}_4 =\{\emptyset, X, \{1,2\}\} $ $\mathcal{T}_5 =\{\emptyset, X, \{1,2\}, \{2,3\}\} $ $\mathcal{T}_6 =\{\emptyset, X, \{1\}, \{1,2\}\} $ $\mathcal{T}_7 =\{\emptyset, X, \{3\}, \{1,2\}\} $ $\mathcal{T}_8 =\{\emptyset, X, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}\} $ $\mathcal{T}_9=\{\emptyset, X,\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}\}$ (The Discrete Topology) Not including the Topologies that are equivalent to the ones above, are there any other Topological Spaces on $X$ that I may be missing?

1189959,Inequality involving exponential partial sums,"Consider the exponential partial sums $E_n(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{x^i}{i!}$.
I want to prove that for all $x \ge 0$:
$$2 \frac {E_{n-1}(x)} {E_n(x)} \ge \frac {E_{n}(x)} {E_{n+1}(x)} + \frac {E_{n-2}(x)} {E_{n-1}(x)}$$ My approach so far First observe that $E_{n-1}(x) = E_{n}(x) - \frac {x^n}{n!}$.
So the inequality becomes: 
$$2 \frac {E_{n}(x) - \frac {x^n}{n!}} {E_n(x)} \ge \frac {E_{n+1}(x) - \frac {x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}} {E_{n+1}(x)} + \frac {E_{n-1}(x) - \frac {x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}} {E_{n-1}(x)}$$
which leads to 
$$2 \frac {\frac {x^n}{n!}} {E_n(x)} \le \frac {\frac {x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}} {E_{n+1}(x)} + \frac {\frac {x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}} {E_{n-1}(x)}$$ So all we need to show is that $\frac {x^n} {n! E_n(x)}$ is convex in $n$. Unfortunately, I didn't have much luck going forward. A good direction could be to use the fact that $n! E_n(x) = e^x \Gamma(n+1,x)$, where $\Gamma(n+1,x) = \int_x^\infty t^n e^{-t} \textrm{dt}$ is the incomplete gamma function . I feel that this way, I will be able to prove the inequality analytically without working painfully with factorials and large sums. So it suffices to show that the following is convex as a function of $n$:
$$\frac {x^n} {\int_x^\infty t^n e^{-t} \textrm{dt}}$$ Any ideas on how to continue? Unfortunately, derivatives of the incomplete gamma function with respect to $n$ are not as nice as those with respect to $x$.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'inequality']"

where $T^*M$ is the holomorphic cotangent bundle and $\bar T^*M$ its antiholomorphic counterpart. By inspection, however, the rhs. of (1) can't be a section of this product space because the first term is a section of $\Lambda^1T^*M\otimes\Lambda^1\bar T^*M$, the second factor a section of $\Lambda^1\bar T^*M\otimes\Lambda^1 T^*M$ and the tensor product is not generally commutative.

This problem is very similar to number one except you can't repeat toppings. This means that the number of options you have to chose from the second time around are one less. This one was rather tricky, and I doubt my answer here but I simply applied combination logic (i.e total number of choices, how many you are allowed to choose). Here repetition is allowed so I picked the proper combination formula for that: $\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$ This problem asked only for the veggie topping pizzas with at least two toppings, so the answer was $C(7, 2).$","['combinations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

1190309,Are Möbius transformations holomorphic or meromorphic?,"In my previous question it was pointed out to me that an ""automorphism"" of the projective line/Riemann sphere (=that is a Möbius transform) is a bijection that is meromorphic in the local coordinate z. Since I didn't know Möbius transforms I tried to find information about them and then on Wikipedia about Möbus transofmrs it is stated that Möbius transformations are exactly the bijective conformal maps from the Riemann sphere to itself. But it is also stated that it is a bijective holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere. I understand that meromorphic is weaker than holomorphic but it's not clear to me where conformal fits in. But mostly it's not clear to me which of these is right. While I was trying to find out which of these 3 descriptions is correct I found out that every Möbius transofrm can be composed into translations, scaling and $z \mapsto 1/z$. Then maybe using this composition, if $1/z$ is holomorphic then so is the Möbius transform? Is a Möbius transform holomorphic (or just meromorphic or conformal) on the Riemann sphere? and Is $1/z$ holomorphic on the Riemann sphere?",['complex-analysis']

1190614,Why restriction to $B(\alpha)$ is a homomorphism from $Gal(E/B)$ to a group with kernel $Gal(E/B(\alpha))$?,"I'm reading Galois Theory for Beginners by John Stillwell. It's a good introduction, giving the essence of the idea with minimum algebra complexity. However, I'm a bit lost at his Theorem 2 (the details are at the end). The proof intend to find a homomorphism of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$, with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$, into an abelian group. John says: The obvious map with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is restriction
  to $B(\alpha)$, $\lvert_{B(\alpha)}$, since by definition $$\sigma \in
\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) \Leftrightarrow \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \texttt{ is the
 identity map}.$$ Why restriction to $B(\alpha)$ is a homomorphism from $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ to a group with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$? What does this ""restriction"" mean? Trying to understand it, I'm taking $B = \mathbb Q$, $\alpha = \zeta$, $B(\alpha) =\mathbb Q(\zeta)$, $E = \mathbb Q (\zeta, \sqrt{2})$,  where $\zeta^5 = 1$. So $$\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) =  \texttt{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb Q(\zeta)), $$ 
in this example  it is $\begin{array}{c|cc}
 \mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})  & \sigma_1 & \sigma_2  \\ 
\hline
\sqrt{2}  & \sqrt{2}  & -\sqrt{2}   \\

\zeta     & \zeta     & \zeta   \\

\zeta^3   & \zeta^3   & \zeta^3  \\
\zeta^4   & \zeta^4   & \zeta^4,

$$S_2 = \{(1), (1,2)\}.$$ Then  $$\texttt{Gal}(E/B) = \texttt{Gal} (\mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb Q),$$
in this example it is $\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}

\zeta^2   & \zeta^2 & \zeta^4 & \zeta   & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta^4 & \zeta & \zeta^3 \\
\zeta^3   & \zeta^3 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^2 & \zeta^3 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^2 \\
\zeta^4   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta,
\end{array}$ so it's isomorphism to
$$\{(1), (3,4,5,6), (3,5,6,4), (3,6)(4,5), (1,2), (1,2)(3,4,5,6), (1,2)(3,5,6,4), (1,2)(3,6)(4,5) \}.$$ My guess is, so that the ""restriction to $B(\alpha)$"" actually means a subset of $\texttt{Gal} (E/B)$ that only change elements in $B(\alpha)$, so itcan be defined as
$$\Sigma := \{ \tau \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B) \lvert \tau(\beta) = \beta, \forall \beta \in E \setminus B(\alpha) \},$$

Theorem 2. If $E\supseteq B(\alpha) \supseteq B$ are fields with $\alpha^p \in B$ for some prime $p$, and if $B(\alpha)$ contains no $p$th roots of unity not in $B$ unless a itself is a $p$th root of unity, then $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is a normal subgroup of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ and $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)/\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is abelian. Proof: By the homomorphism theorem for groups, it suffices to find a homomorphism of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$, with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$, into an abelian group (i.e., onto a subgroup of an abelian group, which of course is also abelian). The obvious map with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is restriction to $B(\alpha)$, $\lvert_{B(\alpha)}$, since by definition
$$\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) \Leftrightarrow \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \texttt{ is the identity map}.$$ The homomorphism property,
$$\sigma' \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}=\sigma'\lvert_{B(\alpha)} \sigma\lvert_{B(\alpha)}, \forall \sigma', \sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B),$$
is automatic provided $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}(b) \in B(\alpha)$ for each $b \in B(\alpha)$, i.e. provided $B(\alpha)$ is closed under each $\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B)$. Since $\sigma$ fixes $B$, $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}$ is completely determined by the value $\sigma(\alpha)$. If $\alpha$ is a $p$th root of unity then
$$(\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \sigma(\zeta^p) = \sigma(1) = 1,$$
hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^i= \alpha^i \in  B(\alpha)$, since each $p$th root of unity is some $\zeta^i$. If $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then
$$ (\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \alpha^p \texttt{ since } \alpha^p \in B,$$
hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^ia$ for some $p$th root of unity $\zeta$; and $\zeta \in B$ by hypothesis, so a\texttt{Gal}in $\sigma(\alpha) \in B(\alpha)$. Thus $B(\alpha)$ is closed as required. This also implies that $I_{B(\alpha)}$ maps $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ into $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$, so it now remains to check that $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is abelian. If $\alpha$ is a root of unity then, as we have just seen, each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form $\sigma_i$, where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \alpha^i$,
hence
$$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\alpha^j) = \alpha^{ij} = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha).$$
Likewise, if $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form
$\sigma_i$ where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \zeta^i\alpha$, hence
$$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\zeta^j\alpha) = \zeta^{i+j}\alpha = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha)$$
since $\zeta \in B$ and therefore $\zeta$ is fixed. Hence in either case $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is abelian.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-homomorphism', 'galois-theory']"

For example, given some set of subsets, what is the ""minimal"" sigma algebra generated by that set of subsets?

I have seen the ""minimal"" set defined different ways, and I am not sure which statement is definition and which is an implication of the definition. The first definition I have seen is to call a set $M$ satisfying some property minimal if, for every other set $A$ satisfying the same property as the set $M$, we have $M \subseteq A$:
\begin{equation*}
M \textrm{ is the minimal set with property } P \iff (\forall A \textrm{ satisfying property P }) M \subseteq A
\end{equation*} The second definition I have seen is to define the minimal set $M$ satisfying some property to be the intersection of all other sets satisfying the same property:
\begin{equation*}
M \textrm{ is the minimal set in some class } C \iff M=\bigcap C
\end{equation*} The second definition seems more concise, however in the example I am studying right now (defining the set of natural numbers to be the minimal inductive set), I don't know if such a set $C$ (the set of all inductive sets) exists, so I am not even sure if the right hand side of definition 2 even makes any formal logical sense.

1191606,What is the optimal strategy for this made-up casino game?,"Part 1: Let's say I walk into a casino with 100 dollars in my wallet. I sit down to play a game where my payoff or loss each round is a X dollars, where X is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed between [-2, 2]. However, because I'm friends with the manager, he gives me a special deal. If X < -1, I only lose a dollars instead of losing anywhere between a and 2a dollars, as I rightfully would. (Note that the random variable is deliberately [-2, 2] instead of [-1, 2], in order that the initial determination of the random variable will have an EV of 0.) The random variable X is redetermined every round. The one choice I get to make is the value of the constant a , which is fixed forever once I choose it. If I want to maximize the amount of cash in my wallet at the end of 50 rounds (and implicit in this question is the need to avoid going bust), what value should I pick for a ? Part 2: Everything is the same, but instead of the payout or loss each round being a X dollars, it is now a (X+ b ). Let's say b = 0.1, so my payout or loss every round will be a * [-1.9, 2.1]. The special deal with my buddy the manager is still on for any X < -1, so I only lose a dollars instead of anywhere between a and 1.9a dollars.

1191626,Uniform Integrability: domination implies UI,"I need to show that if $|f_n|\leq g$, and $g$ is integrable, then $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable, i.e., $\underset{a\rightarrow\infty}\lim\sup_n\int_{[|f_n|\geq a]} |f_n| d\mu=0$. Here is how I thought about it: Since $|f_n|\leq g$, and $g$ is integrable, then each $f_n$ is integrable. Thus, for each $n$, $|f_n| I_{[|f_n|\geq a]}\leq |f_n|$ and $|f_n| I_{[|f_n|\geq a]}\rightarrow 0$ almost everywhere, thus, by Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we have 
$\underset{a\rightarrow\infty}\lim\int_{[|f_n|\geq a]} |f_n|d\mu=0$ for each $n$, and hence, 
$$0=\sup_n \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\int_{[|f_n|\geq a]}|f_n|d\mu=\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\sup_n\int_{[|f_n|\geq a]}|f_n|d\mu.$$ However, I am not so sure about the last step of interchanging the limit and supremum?

My reasoning is that since $A$ and $B$ both have a maxima, then they have an upperbound which belongs to their respective sets. As such, we can think of $A$ and $B$ as closed intervals, and their instersection should then also at least be bounded above, and closed from the right side.

1191650,Continuity of a rational function,"I have to evaluate the continuity of a two functions at a couple of different points and I am a bit stuck. Here are the two functions: $f(x,y) = 0$ if $(x,y)=(0,0)$, $f(x,y) = \frac{x^3y^2}{3x^4+2y^2}$ if $(x,y) \neq (0,0)$. I want to evaluate the continuity of this one at $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. I also have $f(x,y) = 0$ if $(x,y)=(0,0)$, $f(x,y) = \frac{y^3x}{x^2+y^6}$ if $(x,y) \neq (0,0)$. I want to evaluate the continuity of this one at $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Okay, so for both of these functions at $(0,0)$ the denominator is zero along $3x^4+2y^2$ and $x^2+y^6$, respectively, so I cannot simply evaluate the limit of a sequence approaching points along this line to determine the limit. Everywhere else however, including $(1,0)$ the limit exists and is hence continuous. In my class, we did two similar examples, but both denominators were of the form $x^2+y^2$. It was easy to show that for one example, you get a different limit for various sequences approaching the origin, hence the limit DNE. For the other example, we proved a limit existed by using the squeeze theorem. But both ways seemed more to be like tricks to me. How am I supposed to know what to do here without any experience?","['continuity', 'multivariable-calculus', 'limits']"

General solution for $y(t) = C_1\cos(t)+C_2\sin(t)+t-1$. After plugging $y$ into the second equation, I get $x(t)=-C_1\sin(t)+C_2\cos(t)+1+t$ Checking my answer against the back of the book, they show:
$x(t) = C_1\cos(t)+C_2\sin(t)+t+1$ and $y(t)=C_1\sin(t)-C_2\cos(t)+t-1$ I can't seem to find what I did wrong.  Chegg solutions shows to eliminate y instead of x, and got the book's solution.
