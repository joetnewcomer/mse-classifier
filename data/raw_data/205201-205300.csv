4076263,Creating a Skyrim Alchemy metric: combining the binomial theorem and birthday paradox,"I am trying to create a metric to sort alchemy ingredients by in Skyrim,  I wanted to sort the ingredients by ""probability of yielding a potion with the number of ingredients I have"". The way I was looking at the problem is that it is a combination of the Birthday paradox and a binomial trial, but I'm having trouble mixing the two concepts, because 1) it's hard 2) I never took a proper stat class. I'm a physicist by training, and my stat education was all based on error propagation and curve fitting. If you haven't played Skyrim, these are the rules (R) for the alchemy mini-game: Skyrim has ingredients which are combined into potions. Each ingredient has 4 effects, which must be ""discovered."" You can attempt to make a potion with 2 or 3 ingredients. If any of the effects in the combination are the same, a potion will be created with those matched effects. A potion can be created whether the effects were known or unknown before the combination. When you combine 2 ingredients, whose effects were unknown before the combination, and those ingredients both have the same effect, the effect will be discovered for both ingredients. The game keeps track of failed combinations of ingredients. If you select ingredient I, ingredients I' that produced a failed experiment will be greyed out. It is currently unknown if this is ""pullable data"", but it is immediately obvious when playing the alchemy mini-game. A Skyrim alchemy tutorial, with relevant part starting at 8:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E3PkxusHDc&t=508s The end product would hopefully be a mod that would sort the alchemy ingredients by the metric. It would either be a modification to, or require the mod called SkyUI. See: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604?tab=posts Assumptions (A) for modelling the problem Total number of effects is known and fixed (56, e.g. Ravage Health, Fortify Barter, Restore Magika) Potions are created using 3 ingredients When searching for the effects ingredient I, ingredients I' and I'' will be chosen so that no common effects are known. i.e. Skyrim reports ""A potion of unknown effect."" For a given ingredient, all 4 effects are different. See: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) No two ingredients have all 4 of the same effects. The number of ingredients can change based on DLC's and mods to the game, but is approximately 80-200. The game's ""sell value"" of an ingredient is a good proxy for its rarity. Not that important at this stage, but if I am to implement this into a mod for Skyrim, I have these functions to work with (I can create more, or make lookup tables): https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Math_Script For any other imposed assumptions or approximations, an error or uncertainty of <=1% is negligible, and up to 10% is acceptable. E.g. an approximation of a binomial coefficient, swapping a binomial distribution for a gaussian, hack to decrease calculation time. Conjectures (C) (statements that are probably true enough to model the problem with) If you are trying to determine unknown effect(s) of ingredient I, it doesn't matter if the effects of I' or I'' are known or not. Effects are randomly and uniformly distributed amongst ingredients, given conditions A4, A5. Not true, but close enough, see https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ingredients_(Skyrim) . A3 implies that each experiment is testing the unknown effects of ingredient I, amongst 8 unique effects in ingredients I' and I''. This isn't completely true, since if you make a combination of 3 ingredients where I' and I'' have at least 1 unknown effect, it is possible that you could discover a matched effect between I' and I'', but not discover an effect in I. Hypotheses (H) A given experiment/combination/trial, can be modelled as a birthday paradox. With a given unknown effect checking for matches amongst 8 effects in ingredients I' and I''. With the number of people in the room being subbed for number of effects (8? 9? 10? 11? 12?), and days of the year being subbed for the total number of effects (56) Repeated trials can be modelled with the binomial distribution. The probability of a match from the birthday trial gets plugged into the probability of success in the binomial distribution. Questions (Q) for the Internet Are hypotheses 1-3 correct? How do I model the birthday problem? It's like 4 people go into a room of 8, none of the 4 entering people have the same birthdate, and the people in the room could have 5-8 unique birthdays selected from 56 days. For the binomial model, I need ""at least 1 success"", how do I model that? Is it using the (binomial?) distribution equation, or the formula for the definite integral of the distribution? Is the chance of a creating a potion based more on the first ingredient, or the 2nd and 3rd ingredients? What are some resources that would help me solve this problem? Assume that I have access to the internet, LibreOffice, scihub, torrent sites, but not a library or a college math department. I theoretically have access to Mathematica, but it would take 1-8 hours to set up on my Raspberry Pi 3B (I tried yesterday, and I think I FUBARed the OS, hopefully not the Pi or SanDisk). Equations (E) I would actually like to obtain/solve using my mod/code/equations. For the following, Let: I be the ingredient under test, k = number of known effects of ingredient I, T=total number of effects in Skyrim (56), q=quantity of ingredient I (practical range 0-10000), n=number of ingredients in inventory (minimum 3, no theoretical max, practical range 40-100). Given 3 Ingredients, where none of the effects are known, what is the probability that a potion will be created in 1 trial. Given an ingredient I, with k of 4 known effects, what is the probability of of creating a potion with ingredients I' and I'', assuming Skyrim says ""A potion of unknown effect"" What is the probability of discovering effect I_e (e is a subscript from 1-4), amongst all ingredients, within n trials, where n is the quantity of ingredient I in inventory. What is the expected gold wasted (game value of ingredients) before effect I_e is discovered, performing the search required for Equation 3.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'combinatorics', 'binomial-distribution']"

4076352,"Incompleteness of $(C[a,b], \| \cdot \|_1)$ [duplicate]","This question already has an answer here : Completeness of $\langle \mathscr{C} [0, 1], \| \cdot \|_1 \rangle$ (1 answer) Closed 3 years ago . Consider $C([a,b])$ , the vector space of continuous functions in $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ . Let be $f \in C([a,b])$ , we define $\|\cdot\|_1$ as follows: \begin{equation*} 
\|f\|_1 =  \int_{a}^{b}|f(x)|dx 
\end{equation*} I must show that $(C([a,b]), \|\cdot\|_1)$ is not a Banach space. This is my answer the which one is wrong according to my teacher. Consider the following counterexample. Let $c =2^{-1}(a+b)$ y $f_n:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \hspace{.1cm} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ with the following association rule and graph: It's clear that $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset C([a,b])$ . We will show that $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ it's a $||\cdot||_1-Cauchy$ sequence. Let be $\epsilon > 0$ and $N = \displaystyle \left\lceil{ \frac{1}{2 \epsilon}}\right\rceil$ , then: \begin{equation*}

\end{equation*} So the sequence is $||\cdot||_1-Cauchy$ ,
however though this sequence converges to the following limit function, the limit function is clearly discontinuous. Let be $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ : \begin{equation*} f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{si $x \leq c$}\\
        0 & \text{si $x > c$}

\end{equation*} Fixed $\epsilon_1 > 0$ and $N_1 = \left\lceil{\displaystyle\frac{1}{2 \epsilon_1}}\right\rceil$ , then: \begin{equation*}
||f_n-f||_1 = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{1} |f_n(x)-f(x)| = \frac{1}{2n} < \epsilon, \hspace{.1cm} \forall n \geq N_1
\end{equation*} $\textbf{Now, the problem is that}$ (according to my teacher) I only have propose a discontinuous function wich is a limit of the sequence, this does not means that do not exits another continuous function wich is also the limit of the sequence.

Let $Y_n=\max_{1 \leq k \leq n}X_k,W_n=F(Y_n)-(Y_n-X_n)f(Y_n).$ So $Y_n$ is a sub martingale, since $F(Y_{n+1})-F(Y_n)-(Y_{n+1}-X_{n+1})f(Y_{n+1})+(Y_n-X_n)f(Y_n)=F(Y_{n+1})-F(Y_n)-(Y_{n+1}-X_{n+1})f(Y_{n})+(Y_n-X_n)f(Y_n) \geq f(Y_{n})(Y_{n+1}-Y_n)-f(Y_n)(Y_{n+1}-X_{n+1})+(Y_n-X_n)f(Y_n) \geq f(Y_n)(X_{n+1}-X_n).$ This means that $0 \leq E[F(X_1)] \leq E[F(Y_n)]-E[f(Y_n)(Y_n-X_n)],$ so $$\lambda P(Y_n>\lambda) \leq E[X_n1_{\{Y_n>\lambda\}}].$$ In order to have finite values (integrals are well defined...), tried to truncate: $V_n=\min(k,X_n),$ but $V_n$ is not necessarily a sub martingale.

4076582,Can the gradient operator $\nabla_\mathbf{x}$ be treated as a standalone vector?,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a scalar function. Then, the gradient of $f(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as: $$

(\nabla_x \nabla_x^T) (f(\mathbf{x}))
$$ In other words, I left-multiply the row vector $\nabla_x^T$ by the column vector $\nabla_x$ to get an $n \times n$ matrix of second-order partial derivative operators.

4076758,Conditions for weak convergence and generalized distribution functions,"I am having some trouble proving Corollary 6.3.2 in Borovkov's Probability Theory (for reference, this material is on pages 147 to 149 in the book). For convenience, I provide some definitions and related theorems. Skip to the end for a TLDR. Definition: We say a function $G$ is a generalized distribution function if it satisfies monotonicity and right-continuity. We denote the class of generalized distribution functions to be $\mathcal{G}$ and the class of distribution functions to be $\mathcal{F}$ . Of course, $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{G}$ and the only difference is that distribution functions have $\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x) = 1$ and $\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x) = 0$ . Definition: We say that a sequence of generalized distribution functions $\{G_n\}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ converges weakly to some $G\in \mathcal{G}$ if, for all points of continuity $x\in\mathbb{R}$ of $G$ , we have $G_n(x)\to G(x)$ . Note that the above definition is not as ""nice"" as weak convergence in distribution functions. Recall that, for $\{F_n\}\subseteq \mathcal{F}$ and $F\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $F_n(x)\to F(x)$ for each point of continuity of $F$ , an equivalent condition is to say that, for all bounded continuous functions $f$ , we have $$\int f\ \mathrm{d}F_n \to \int f\ \mathrm{d}F.$$ However, this equivalence is not true for the case where $G_n,G\in\mathcal{G}$ . Some extra definitions: Definition: A sequence of probability measures $\{\mathbb{F}_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is said to be tight if, for all $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $$\inf_n \mathbb{F}_n([-N,N]) > 1- \varepsilon.$$ Definition: A class of bounded continuous functions $\mathcal{L}$ is said to be distribution determining if, for $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$ , $$\int f\ \mathrm{d}F = \int f\ \mathrm{d}G \qquad (\forall f\in \mathcal{L})$$ implies that $F=G$ . The book then presents a variation of Helly's selection theorem and a corollary: Theorem (Helly's Selection Theorem): Let $\{G_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\subseteq \mathcal{G}$ be a sequence of generalized distribution  functions, then there exists some subsequence $\{G_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$ such that $G_{n_k}$ converges weakly to $G$ for some $G\in \mathcal{G}$ . That is, the space $\mathcal{G}$ is sequentially compact with respect to weak convergence. Corollary: If every convergent subsequence of a sequence $G_n$ converges weakly to the same $G\in\mathcal{G}$ then the entire sequence $G_n$ converges weakly to $G$ . The following theorem is true: Theorem: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a distribution determining class and $\{\mathbb{F}_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of probability measures. Then $\mathbb{F}_n$ converges weakly to some probability measure $\mathbb{F}$ if and only if the sequence $\{\mathbb{F}_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is tight and $\lim_n \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_n$ exists for all $f\in \mathcal{L}$ . I will provide a proof of the converse that basically outlines Borovkov's proof: Proof . By Helly's selection theorem, there exists a subsequence of distribution functions (that correspond to the probability measures) $F_{n_k}$ that converges weakly to some $F\in \mathcal{G}$ . Now, let $\varepsilon>0$ . By the tightness of $\mathbb{F}_{n_k}$ , can find some $M$ such that, for all $x\geq M$ , we have $$\inf_k F_{n_k}(x) \geq \inf_k \mathbb{F}_{n_k}([-M,M]) > 1- \varepsilon.$$ Let $x$ be a point of continuity of $F$ with $x\geq M$ (this must exist as $F$ only has countably many points of discontinuity). We then have $$F(x) = \lim_k F_{n_k}(x) \geq \inf_k F_{n_k}(x) >1- \varepsilon.$$ Further, for all $y\geq x$ , we would have $F(y) > 1- \varepsilon$ . Therefore, we have $\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x) = 1$ . A similar argument shows that $\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x) = 0$ . Hence, we have $F\in \mathcal{F}$ is actually a distribution function. It remains to show that the entire sequence $\mathbb{F}_n$ converges weakly to the $\mathbb{F}$ (given by the distribution function $F$ ) above. By Corollary to Helly's selection theorem, it suffices to show, for arbitrary $\{F_{n_j}\}_{j=1}^\infty$ subsequence that converges weakly to some $G\in \mathcal{G}$ , we have $F=G$ . First, notice that the above argument ensures the limit function is actually a distribution function, so we actually have $G\in\mathcal{F}$ . Let $\mathbb{F}$ and $\mathbb{G}$ denote the probability measures induced by distribution functions $F$ and $G$ , respectively. Since $F_{n_j}$ converges weakly to $G \in\mathcal{F}$ , we have, for all $f\in \mathcal{L}$ , $$\lim_j \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_{n_j} = \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{G}.$$ Further, the weak convergence of our original sequence $\{\mathbb{F}_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ to $\mathbb{F}$ gives us that, for all $f\in \mathcal{L}$ , $$\lim_k \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_{n_k} = \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}.$$ Since $\lim_n \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_n$ exists for all $f\in \mathcal{L}$ , all its subsequences must converge to the same limit, which gives us $$\int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F} = \lim_k \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_{n_k} = \lim_j \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{F}_{n_j} = \int f\ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{G}$$ As the above equality holds for all $f\in \mathcal{L}$ , a distribution determining class, we have $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{F}'$ and thus $F=F'$ , as desired. However, I am having trouble proving the following corollary (I copied and paste straight from the text): I am having trouble showing that (2) is sufficient. The argument they gave appears to be down the lines of the following (just basing off the proof of the previous theorem) Consider the sequence $F_n$ , by Helly's selection theorem, we have $F_{n_k}$ converges weakly to some $G\in \mathcal{G}$ . Further, we have, for each of those subsequences that converge weakly, $$\lim_{k\to\infty}\int f\ \mathrm{d}F_{n_k} = \int f\ \mathrm{d}F.$$ Now, it would be nice if we also write (I think the author just assumes this, but this does not appear to be true for me) $$\lim_{k\to\infty}\int f\ \mathrm{d}F_{n_k} = \int f\ \mathrm{d}G$$ If that's true, then we're done because that would imply $G=F$ and every subsequence that converges in $F_n$ converges to the same distribution function. But we cannot do that , because $G\in \mathcal{G}$ and we know that weak convergence (as defined by pointwise convergence to all points of continuity in the limit function) is no longer equivalent to convergence in integrals. TLDR: I have having trouble proving (2) is sufficient in the above corollary and the hint the author gave is confusing.","['measure-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'cumulative-distribution-functions', 'real-analysis', 'probability-theory']"

4076794,A rigorous proof that $\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$,"Suppose that $\rho: \mathbb R^3 \to \mathbb R$ is a function that tells us the electric charge density at each point in space. According to Coulomb's law, the electric field at a point $x \in \mathbb R^3$ is $$
E(x) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \frac{x - y}{\|x - y \|^3} \, dy.
$$ Question: How do you prove rigorously that, for the function $E$ defined above, we have $$
\tag{1} \nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} .
$$ Comments: It's not easy to find a rigorous proof of this because physics textbooks tend to give non-rigorous arguments, whereas math books tend not to discuss this at all because it's about physics. Here's a typical physics derivation of this fact: \begin{align}
\nabla \cdot E(x) &= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \, \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{x - y}{\|x - y \|^3} \right) \, dy \\
&= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \, 4 \pi \,\delta(x - y) \, dy \\
&= \frac{\rho(x)}{\epsilon_0}.
\end{align} This non-rigorous argument is based on the assertion that the divergence of the function $x \mapsto \frac{x}{\|x\|^3}$ is $4 \pi \delta$ , where $\delta$ is the delta function on $\mathbb R^3$ . That claim is typically justified by non-rigorous arguments. Bonus question: Where would I look to find a rigorous proof of this or similar physics equations? Is there a book on electromagnetism written for mathematicians? A similar question was asked on the physics stackexchange, but it hasn't received a good answer. Since the question is about providing a rigorous proof I think it's a better fit for math.stackexchange. Edit: I think a key insight I was missing is that proving (1) is equivalent to showing that $$
\tag{2} \text{if} \quad \varphi(x) = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \| x - y \|^{-1} \, dy \quad \text{then}\quad  
\nabla^2 \varphi = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
$$ The function $-\varphi$ is called the electric potential in electrostatics. This fact (2) is fundamental to the study of the Laplace equation and Poisson's equation, and it is of course proved rigorously in PDEs textbooks such as Evans. So, it is not that there is a gap in the mathematical literature -- rather, if you want to find a rigorous proof of (1), you just need to recognize that it's equivalent to (2). Why does (2) imply (1)? First notice that if $y \in \mathbb R^3$ and $h(x) = -\|x - y \|^{-1}$ then $\nabla h(x) = \frac{x - y}{\|x - y \|^3}$ for all $x \in \mathbb R^3, x \neq y$ .
It follows that \begin{align}
\tag{3} \nabla \varphi(x) &= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \nabla \left( -\| x - y \|^{-1} \right) \, dy \\
&= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb R^3} \rho(y) \frac{x - y}{\|x - y \|^3} \, dy \\
&= E(x).
\end{align} So, $$
\nabla^2 \varphi(x) = \nabla \cdot \nabla \varphi(x) = \nabla \cdot E(x).
$$ Thus, if we can show that $\nabla^2 \varphi = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$ , then we will have shown that $\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$ . By the way, it is still not clear to me how to prove (3) rigorously. I think we need to use the dominated convergence theorem or one of the theorems from measure theory which imply that, under certain conditions, the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit.","['electromagnetism', 'real-analysis']"

I've been guilty of that before . I've been looking at permutations $\sigma \in S_n$ and computing the greatest number of occurrences of the pattern $\sigma$ over all permutations in $S_m$ . (This is only interesting when $m > n$ .) I asked about one aspect of this on MSE a few days ago with my question Greatest number of occurrences of the pattern 4213 in a permutation . In an answer, Misha Lavrov pointed me at a 2002 paper called On Packing Densities of Permutations , which addresses this idea. The Observation Using code from Code Golf Stack Exchange Users Noodle9 and Arnauld, it appears that the greatest number of occurrences of the pattern 2143 over all permutations in $S_n$ is equal to $A000241(n+1)$ , the crossing number of complete graph with $n+1$ nodes—that is, the fewest number of edge-intersections of the complete graph $K_{n+1}$ when drawn in the plane. This is true for all known crossing numbers of $K_n$ : $A000241(1)$ through $A000241(12)$ . The largest crossing number, $A000241(12)$ , was computed back in 2007, and if bigger values have been computed since, I don't know of it. This means that without computing more crossing numbers (which is hard, presumably), you can't prove that these are unequal by a numerical comparison. Question I suspect that these numbers are eventually different—although permutation patterns show up in surprising places. Is there some correspondence which shows that these values are equal in general? Or can you use some asymptotic argument (or other argument) to show that they're different eventually?","['permutations', 'graph-theory', 'oeis', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-optimization']"

$$ After substituting this new measure inside the integral of $f(g(x,y))$ and manipulating a little, it is found that $$

Where we can think of $C$ being in the torus and $D$ be the generator of the fundamental group of the solid torus.We wanna compute $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3-L)$ . So first we note that using Van-Kampen we have that $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3-L)=\pi_1(S^3-L)$ . Then we have that $S^3=\partial (D^4)=S^1\times D_2 \cup D_2\times S_1$ . Let's call $A=S^1\times D^2$ and $B=D^2\times S_1$ where $B$ is the torus that contains the point at infinity. Now we will have that $C\subset A\cap B$ , $L\subset A$ and $C\subset B$ . So that $A-L$ and $B-L$ are closed sets such that $A-L \cup B-L=S^3-L$ . Now we note that $(A\cap B-L ,A-L)$ and $(A\cap B-L,B-L)$ are cofibrations. And so we can apply the van-kampen theorem for closed subspaces. Now we have that $\pi_1(A\cap B-L)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ since $A\cap B-L$ is essentially an annulus, $\pi_1(A-L)\cong \mathbb{Z}\bigoplus \mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(B-L)\cong \mathbb{Z}$ .

4077720,Generalized Regular Polygon Area Formula to Any Number of Sides,"I was looking for a way to check if the regular polygon area formula of $\frac{ns^2}{4} \cot \frac{π}{n}$ where s is the side length and n is the number of sides could be extended to fractional  and irrational n. Setting s to be 1, we get the constant in exact form of the area of the polygon. This also gives the area of the unit polygon as well. I am assuming the area of the entire polygon not using the even-odd rule just like the Wolfram Alpha example. Let this area be called $A_n=\frac{n}{4}\cot\frac{π}{n}$ Testing n= $\frac{5}{2}$ , we see that the interior angle is θ= $\frac{4π}{5}$ . This creates the pentagram polygon with Schläfli Symbol of $\lbrace\frac{5}{2}
\rbrace$ . When putting the formula into use, $A_\frac{5}{2}=\frac{5/2}{4}\cot\frac{π}{5/2}$ = $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{8}\sqrt{5-2\sqrt{5}}$ , but when searching in Wolfram Mathworld, the constant came out to be A(unit pentagram or area constant of pentagram)= $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{4}\sqrt{65-29\sqrt{5}}$ . Similarly, the area of a pentagon can be used in the formula to give $A_5=\frac{5}{4}\cot\frac{π}{5}$ = $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}$ , In addition, one interpretation of the number of sides can also be the perimeter as we are assuming the side length is $\frac{5}{2}$ meaning that each side has a length of $\frac{1}{2}$ or less which contradicts the assumption that we can only have one side. However, if we allow the side length to be one without any scaling of the sides as a result of the n-value, the formula still has the constant incorrect. Only when solving for the area of the $36^\circ-126^\circ-18^\circ$ triangle, do we get the value. After multiplying by $10$ , the number of triangles in the shape, we get the same value as in Wolfram Mathworld. This triangle is the triangle when the shape is radially divided into ten equal triangles. My question is what the restrictions are for the formula $A=A(n,s)=\frac{ns^2}{4}\cot \frac{π}{n}$ where n is the number of sides and s is the side length. It definitely works for $n\in\Bbb Z$ an integer assuming negative values of n would correspond to negative areas. If $n=0$ , the formula is undefined as well as for any values $n= \frac{1}{m}$ where $m\in\Bbb Z$ and the formula equals $0$ when n= $\frac{2}{2m+1}$ where $m\in\Bbb Z$ . My second question is if there are restrictions for this equation, what would be a general formula only in terms of $n$ and $s$ defined in the above paragraph? This means $n,s\in\Bbb R$ . How about for $n,s\in\Bbb C$ ? How about $n$ and $s$ in the set of all matrices with complex entries $\Bbb M$ ? It seems like for a regular complex polygon, the area would be in the form of A=2n* $\frac{1}{2}$ b h=n b h=n c*h where 2n is the amount of dividing triangles there are in the polygon, $\frac{1}{2}$ b h is the area of these triangles, and c is the circumradius being equal to the base, denoted by b, of each triangle. This premise assumes the regular complex polygon is “filled” so that the “star” outline was filled in completely without any self-intersections affecting the area definition. Going onto seedcode and setting the stator rotor (sr) to the number of sides and leaving only one rotor to be inside the stator rotor (sr) which is named rotor 1 (r1) to be the turning number will give a shape reminiscent of the shape with Schläfli of $$\left\{ \frac{p}{q}\right\}=\left\{ \frac{sr}{r1}\right\}=\left\{ \frac{\text{number  of sides}}{\text{turning number}}\right\}$$ Be sure to set the pen radius (r) in the app to be r1. In the app, r=r1. Thanks to @Blue for figuring out the formula for a “filled” star polygon in terms of the circumradius and Schläfli number $$\{N\}=\text{ratio}=\left\{\frac{p}{q}\right\}$$ . I also appreciate them for giving insight into the other convention. Going on the star polygon link below, gives the circumradius in terms of the ratio which then can be simplified to $\frac{1}{2} \csc\frac{π}{N}$ . This can be intuitively and geometrically understood by imagining the cosecant operator in the diagram in their post. However, this assumes a unit length and therefore “area constant”. Interestingly enough, substituting this value into their formula for r and multiplying by $s^2$ for s being the side length simplified down to: $$\text{Area}\left(\text{“filled” polygon with side length }s\text{ and Schläfli symbol }\{N\}=\left\{\frac a b\right\}\right)=A(a,b,s)=A_N (s)= \frac{a s^2\csc^2 \frac{π}{N}}{4(\cot\frac{π}{a}+\tan\frac{π}{N})}$$ . Testing the pentagram we get $$A_{5/2} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{4}\sqrt{65-29\sqrt{5}}=.31027…$$ after a few steps, the same value as in Wolfram Mathworld. Amazingly, when putting $$N=a=\frac a1 =\frac ab$$ we get $$A_N (s)=\frac {a s^2 }4 \cot \frac πa$$ which implies the cotangent formula assuming a “filled polygon” and b=1 can only have n as an integer and n not equal to 0. Even trying a pure imaginary number such as $\{N\}=\left\{\frac i2\right \} $ with side length $i$ experimentally gets: $$A_{\frac i2} (i)=\frac 14\tanh(\pi)\coth(2\pi)\text{csch}(2\pi)=\frac{e^{2\pi}(e^{4 \pi}+1)}{2(e^{2 \pi}+1)^3(e^{2 \pi}-1)}=.00093025…$$ after a few steps.

In case that article gets edited, here's the screenshot: A couple of aspects in the proof are unclear: In proving that the set of $G$ -equivariant maps $\alpha_\ast:\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)\to\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$ is a group, I'm not sure what the inverse of $\alpha_\ast$ is. A (probably) related question: $X$ is the image of the unique object $\ast$ under $H^\ast$ , i.e., $\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$ . $\text{Perm}(X)$ is the set/group of bijections from $\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$ into itself. To show that all equivariant maps form a subgroup of this group, we need to show that each equivariant map $\alpha_\ast$ is a bijection from $\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$ into itself. But I don't see why $\alpha_\ast$ has to be a bijection. $\alpha$ is just a natural transformation, not a natural isomorphism. I'm a little confused about the this point from Wikipedia: ""(2) the function which gives the bijection is a group homomorphism"". What function is meant here? The function from the (dual version of the) Yoneda lemma $[\mathcal C,\textbf{Set}](H^\ast,H^\ast)\to\mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$ doesn't seem to be exactly the right function because its domain has elements that are natural transformations $\alpha$ , but we want to construct a function from the set of $G$ -equivariant maps, which have the form $\alpha_\ast$ for some natural transformation $\alpha$ . So I suspect that the map that is meant is the composite $$\{\alpha_\ast: \alpha:H^\ast\to H^\ast\text{ is a nat. transf.}\}\to \{\text{nat. transf. } \alpha:H^\ast\to H^\ast\}\to \mathcal C(\ast,\ast)$$ where the first map is a ""natural"" bijection (natural in the non-technical sense). But if so, I don't really see why this is a group homomorphism. If we call this composition $f$ , then we need to show that $f(\beta_\ast\circ\alpha_\ast)=f(\beta_\ast)\circ f(\alpha_\ast)$ or equivalently $\beta_\ast(\alpha_\ast(1_\ast))=\beta_\ast(1_\ast)\circ\alpha_\ast(1_\ast)$ . I don't really see why this is true, although this must be something easy.","['representable-functor', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'yoneda-lemma', 'group-theory']"
4079067,Open map that is not continuous,"I was trying to find an open map that is not continuous, here was my effort, is it ok? Consider the map $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor$ where $\mathbb{R}$ has the standard topology and $\mathbb{Z}$ has the discrete topology. Then $\{1\}$ is open in $\mathbb{Z}$ . However $f^{-1}(\{1\})=[1,2)$ , which is not open in $\mathbb{R}$ , so $f$ is not continuous. Since $\mathbb{Z}$ has the discrete topology, the image of any open set is necessarily open. Thus, $f$ is an open map.","['general-topology', 'solution-verification']"

4079437,Can someone answer my question about geometry triangles,"I saw on a children's maths program in early 1980; I think it was Johnny Ball presenting. He drew an obtuse triangle (or I think it was obtuse). Then he put a dot anywhere in the triangle and drew three lines through the dot from each point of the triangle to the other end. He then drew a smaller triangle within the original by joining points created on the sides of the original triangle. Before I state the problem I will try to make my explanation clearer. The dot is placed anywhere inside the obtuse triangle and a line is drawn from each of the three vertices, through the dot to the other end of the triangle. Another smaller triangle is created by drawing three lines from the points (points of intersection of the lines and the sides) on the sides of the larger triangle. Then what Mr Ball did was to find where he could project outwards from the larger triangle and the inner triangle so that the lines met, when you find the projections for all three sides of both triangles that meet, these points create a perfectly straight line. Is there a name for this triangle projection and is there a practical use for this or is it just a fun thing to learn? I have always thought this fascinating.

For the equation $x^2=2yx$ , we have a single line that completely overlaps with $x=2y$ . For the equation $x^2=4y^2$ , we have two intersecting lines, only one of which overlaps with $x=2y$ . In either case, this is satisfying because it explains the logical concepts of: $$x=2y \implies x^2=4y^2$$ $$\text{and}$$ $$x=2y \implies x^2=2yx$$ which I feel as though I am implicitly using during different algebraic proofs. That is to say, the set of solutions for $x=2y$ also satisfies ( intersects with ) the equations (sets) $x^2=4y^2$ and $x^2=2yx$ . In line with our earlier set interpretation, letting $x^2=2yx$ represent the set $B=\{\langle x,y \rangle \in \mathbb R \times \mathbb R | x^2=2yx\}$ and letting $x^2=4y^2$ represent the set $C=\{\langle x,y \rangle \in \mathbb R \times \mathbb R | x^2=4y^2\}$ , the aforementioned implication suggests $A \subseteq B$ and $A\subseteq C$ .

But I am wondering if there is a more fundamental reason that explains this observation . In particular, the quality of inverse exponents versus the quality of inverse multiplication. To simplify $x^2=2yx$ , I am effectively multiplying each side by $x^{-1}$ . Comparatively, to simplify $x^2=4y^2$ (perhaps better written as $x^2=(2y)^2$ ), I am taking the inverse operation of squaring.

Set $\{1,2,...,p-1\}$ has $p-1$ elements and we divided it into four-element equivalence classes (or two-element - according to above). Now if $p-1=4m+2$ then we have only one couple $\{1, p-1\}$ and the rest of the classes is four-element. Due to this fact equation $s^2 \equiv-1(\mod \;p)$ has no solutions. $(*)$ But if we take $p - 1 \equiv 4m$ then we have also additional two-element equivalence class containing solutions of $s^2 \equiv-1(mod \;p)$ which we were looking for. $(**)$ Question section I have a question related to this proof -  I marked by $(*), (**)$ parts in proof to which I have queries. How exactly using this facts from contents of equivalence classes we can justify something on solutions of equation $s^2 \equiv -1 (mod \; p)$ ? I just don't quite get it. Could you please give me a hand explaining this part of the proof ? EDIT The remaining thing for me two understand is only that: (1) For $p-1 = 4m+2$ there is only one two-element equivalence class $\{1, p-1\}$ and other are four-element. (2) For $p - 1 = 4m$ there is one equivalence class $\{x_0, p-x_0\}$ , one $\{1, p-1\}$ and remaining ones are four-element. Maybe it's obvious but I don't understand how it can be truth. For example equivalent formulation of (1) is that: $\exists! x_0 : x_0 \equiv \bar{x_0} (mod \; 4m+2)$ and for remaining $x \in \{1,2,...,4m+2\} \setminus \{x_0\}$ we have that equivalence class cannot be shorten. Could you please explain to me how to prove that ?","['divisibility', 'number-theory', 'proof-explanation', 'equivalence-relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I've been playing around with some binomial coefficients and their divisibility, and I stumbled upon a relation that seems to hold, at least for $0 < k < n < 200$ (checked with Python): $$ (k + 1) \mid \binom{n}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}. $$ I initially thought that the following reasoning would work. Since $\binom{n}{k}$ has $k$ terms in the numerator, the only way that there is no multiple of $(k+1)$ in the numerator of $\binom{n}{k}$ is when $n \equiv -1 \pmod{k+1}$ . But then $(k+1)\mid(n+1)$ , so there is a multiple of $(k+1)$ in the numerator of $\binom{n+1}{k}$ . Unfortunately, I'm not sure if showing that there is a multiple of $(k+1)$ in the numerator of the expression is sufficient for all values of $k$ . It definitely works when $(k+1)$ is prime, but if not, there is the possibility that the designated multiple of $(k+1)$ is canceled out by other terms in the denominator. So: is there a way to patch up this argument, or could this statement be proven by entirely different means? (Bonus brownie points if there's a combinatorial argument.)

4079859,Extending $\sum_{n=0}^\infty s^{n^2}$ beyond its natural boundary,"Let $\mathbb{D} = \{s \in \mathbb{C} : |s| < 1\}$ . Let $f : \mathbb{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ where $$ f(s) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty s^{n^2} $$ $f$ is analytic on $\mathbb{D}$ . This is what it looks like: $\partial \mathbb{D}$ is a natural boundary , so ordinary analytic continuation cannot extend $f$ beyond $\mathbb{D}$ . However, there might be another way to extend $f$ beyond $\mathbb{D}$ that is both aesthetically natural and yields a unique result. For example, see generalized analytic continuation and Continuation of functions beyond natural boundaries . Let $$ \Delta = \left\{\exp \left( 2\pi i \frac{2n + 1}{4m + 2} \right) : m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\} \subseteq \partial \mathbb{D} $$ Note that $\Delta$ is dense . It seems that \begin{align}

    \lim_{r \uparrow 1} \partial_r f(r \omega) &= 0

4079863,Invariant problem: Prove that you can't color every line of the graph,"Given a graph with $6$ vertices and $15$ edges, every starting line is colored yellow. On each step we can choose any $3$ lines that create a triangle (triangle's vertices have to match graph's vertices) and change the color of each line. If the color's yellow, change it to red and if it's red change it to yellow. Prove that no matter what you do, you can't get $15$ red lines. Hint: In order to find invariant choose a vertex and look at the adjacent lines. Here's the picture: Well after thinking for a while, I came up with this reasoning: Each vertex has $5$ lines, if the vertex's part of the triangle, then $2$ of it's sides get colored every time. So we want to get $5$ red lines, but we're swapping even lines each time, so we can't reach odd red lines. Therefore we can't color this graph into only red lines. But I think this requires stronger reasoning. How do I prove this more formally?","['graph-theory', 'coloring', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4079914,permutation on a circle within some distance,"Assuming $n$ children sitting around a round table. For example, 7 children. At the second time they changed seats, so this is a permutation $\omega$ . Each child's new seat and previous seat define a distance, if the permutation is $6 1 2	5	3	4	0$ , so now the child last round took seat # $0$ is now seating at # $6$ , so he moved $1$ distance, or $d(0)=1$ . Call the biggest distance of all the children the distance of the circle permutation. For example the distance of all the children are $1,0,0,1,1,2,1$ , so the $d(\omega) = \max_i d(i) = 2$ . Now the questions is, for $n$ children, if the distance shall be no more than $k$ , how many permutations $N(n,k)$ are there? Of course $\forall n$ , $N(n,0)=1$ , i.e. no one moves. If $k=1$ it's also simple, $N(n,1) = F(n+1)+F(n-1)+2$ , here $F(n)$ is the Fibonacci numbers starting with $F(0)=0$ , and $F(1)=1$ .
for example if $n=10$ , then $N(10,1)=135$ . But when $k\ge 2$ it's turns quite complex I couldn't find a nice solution.

4080260,Can the points of a convergent sequence be connected by a smooth curve?,"Suppose $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is the unit ball and $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in $U$ that converges to $0$ . Does there exist a smooth curve $\gamma \colon \left[0,1 \right] \to U$ such that the image of $\gamma$ contains a subsequence of $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ and such that $\gamma(0)=x_1$ and $\gamma(1)=0$ ? I do not know how to approach this. The case for finitely many points already troubles me. I know about smoothing piece-wise linear curves but that is not really helpful here. Edit: So, I did have an idea to get a $C^0$ -curve that is analytic on $(0,1]$ , so everywhere except one boundary point. Sadly my approach will probably never explicitly produce a $C^{\infty}$ -curve. Consider $\mathbb{R}^n\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ and the given sequence as a sequence in $\mathbb{C}^n$ . That is one gets $n$ sequences in $\mathbb{C}$ by considering the components $\left\{ x_i^j \right\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ . Also one may consider the discrete sequence $\left\{1,2,3,... \right\}$ in $\mathbb{C}$ . As $\mathbb{C}$ is a Stein manifold it follows that there exists holomorphic functions $f^j\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $f^j(i)=x^j_i.$ Then $g'^j:=\mathrm{Re}(f^j)\mid_{\mathbb{R}}\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ also satisfies the above equation and note that $\lim_{x\to \infty }g'^j(x)=0$ . One may moreover consider the analytic  map $g^j\colon (0,1] \to \mathbb{R},\; x \mapsto g'^j(1/x)$ it satisfies $\lim_{x\to 0} g^j(x)=0$ and thus extends continuously to $[0,1]$ .
