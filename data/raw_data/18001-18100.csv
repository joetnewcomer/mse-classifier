148715,Can we extend the definition of a homomorphism to binary relations?,"This is going to be quite a long post. The actual questions will be at the end of it in section ""Questions."" INTRODUCTION After receiving an answer to this question about extending the definition of a continuous function to binary relations, I started thinking about doing the same with homomorphisms in abstract algebra. It seems more difficult to me because there seems not to be a unique obvious way of doing it. I tried a modest task first: to do this for semigroups (so for groups too in particular). Ring or algebra homomorphisms seem more difficult to generalize. I have ended up with two definitions for semigroup homomorphisms, but I'm not sure if they're of any use. Both fail to satisfy a property I thought they should satisfy. I will explain this later. ATTEMPTED DEFINITIONS Let $S,T$ be semigroups. A function $\varphi:S\to T$ is a homomorphism if it satisfies $$\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi(b).\tag1$$ If $\rho\subseteq S\times T$ is a binary relation, the following also makes sense: $$\rho(ab)=\rho(a)\rho(b),\tag2$$ but now $\rho(ab),\rho(a),\rho(b)$ are not elements of $T$, but of $2^T$. Yet $(2)$ makes sense, because $2^T$ also has a structure of a semigroup, with the operation defined by $$AB=\{ab\,|\,a\in A,\,b\in B\}.$$ This gives an idea for a definition. Definition 1. $\rho$ is element-wise homomorphic iff for any $a,b\in S,$ we have $$\rho(ab)=\rho(a)\rho(b).$$ But there's another idea. Every function $\varphi:S\to T$ can be extended to a function $\overline\varphi : 2^S\to 2^T$ as follows. $$\overline\varphi(A)=\varphi(A),$$ where $\varphi(A)$ denotes the image of $A$ under $\varphi.$ Obviously, $$\overline\varphi(\{a\})=\{\varphi(a)\}.$$ Now let $\varphi$ be a homomorphism. Fact 1. $\overline\varphi$ is a semigroup homomorphism from $2^S$ to $2^T$. Proof. Let $A,B\subseteq S.$ Then $$
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline\varphi(AB)&=&\{\varphi(ab)\,|\, a\in A,\,b\in B\}\\
&=&\{\varphi(a)\varphi(b)\,|\,a\in A,\,b\in B\}\\
&=&\{xy\,|\,x\in\varphi(A),\,y\in\varphi(B)\}\\
&=&\{xy\,|\,x\in\overline\varphi(A),\,y\in\overline\varphi(B)\}\\
&=&\overline\varphi(A)\overline\varphi(B).
\end{eqnarray}
$$ Also, it is obvious that if $\overline\varphi$ is a homomorphism, then $\varphi$ is a homomorphism too, because it essentially a restriction of $\overline\varphi$ to the subsemigroup $S$ of the semigroup $2^S.$ This gives us Fact 2. $\varphi:S\to T$ is a homomorphism iff $\overline\varphi:2^S\to 2^T$ is a homomorphism. Now $\rho$ also induces a function $\overline\rho:2^S\to 2^T$ by $$\overline\rho(A)=\rho(A),$$ where $\rho(A)$ denotes the image of $A$ under $\rho.$ This gives another idea for a definition. Definition 2. $\rho$ is set-wise homomorphic iff $\overline\rho:2^S\to 2^T$ is a semigroup homomorphism. WHY I THINK IT DOESN'T WORK I think a good definition of a homomorphic relation $\rho$ should give that $\rho^{-1}$ is also homomorphic. This would be a generalization of the fact that a bijective homomorphism is an isomorphism. (That is, we don't need to check whether the inverse function is a homomorphism.) Both definitions fail here. Let $\varphi:\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$ be the trivial homomorphism. Then $$\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{1\}+\{-1\})=\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{0\})=\mathbb Z.$$ But $$\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{1\})=\varnothing$$ and $$\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{-1\})=\varnothing,$$ so $$\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{1\})\overline{\left(\varphi^{-1}\right)}(\{-1\})=\varnothing.$$ QUESTIONS (1) Is there a standard definition of a ""homomorphic binary relation"" for semigroups? other algebraic structures? (2) Has anything similar to the definitions I'm giving been tried in literature? (3) When defining a ""homomorphic binary relation"", what could make one defintion more sensible than another? (This is imprecise of course, but I want to ask it in case someone has a precise answer.)","['relations', 'semigroups', 'abstract-algebra']"

148755,Does $\sqrt{\delta^2}$ make more sense than $\delta^2$?,"What is the Product of $\delta$ functions with
itself? was already
asked some time ago. In a comment the OP states: I want to create $\delta(t)$ such that the product with itself is also $\delta(t)$ and the innerproduct $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t)\cdot\delta(t) dt = 1$ and retain all other properties of the usual $\delta(t)$. I feel that I'm in a comparable situation: I'd like to have a function
$\Delta(x)$, such that $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Delta(x)^2 f(x)
dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\delta(x)f(x)dx$ and $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Delta(x-t)\Delta(x+t)f(x)dx=0$ for $t\neq 0$. Combining these gives:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Delta(x-t)\Delta(x+t)f(x)dx=\delta_{t0}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\delta(x)f(x)dx,
$$
with $\delta_{xy}$ being the Kronecker
Delta . I think that
following could work: Let $\Delta_a(x\pm t)=\frac{1}{a \sqrt{\pi}} \mathrm{e}^{-(x\pm
t)^2/\color{red}{2}a^2}$ (little related to the so called nascent
delta function ). The $\color{red}{2}$ in the denominator inspired the title and I hope it was not misleading you, sorry if so. When I now, for example, set $f(x)=1$ and calculate
$$
\lim_{a\to 0}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Delta_a(x-t)\Delta_a(x+t)dx,

148757,Dimension of quotient in projective space,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with characteristic distinct from $2$. I want to compute the multiplicity of the intersection of the points which lie in $V_{1} \cap V_{2}$ where: $V_{1}=V(x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}$ and $V_{2}=V(x^{2}+y^{2}-2z^{2}) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}$. Well doing the algebra shows they intersect at two points $[1:i:0]$ and $[1:-i:0]$. By Bezout's theorem we know that the sum of the multiplicities is equal to $4$ right? Now, as I understand, to compute the multiplicity at $[1:i:0]$ we need to take a chart containing this point yes? so we can take say $x=1$ then we need to compute the dimension of the following vector space: $k[y,z]/(1+y^{2}-z^{2},1+y^{2}-2z^{2})$ Macaulay says that the dimension is equal to $4$ but isn't this impossible? it would force that that the intersection multiplicity of the other point is zero but this is impossible because the point lies in the intersection. What am I doing wrong? EDIT: is the mistake that we are taking a chart which also contains the point $[1:-i:0]$?, that is, do we need to take a chart that contains $[1:i:0]$ but not $[1:-i:0]$? can we take then $x=1$ and $z=1$?",['algebraic-geometry']

The space $C_n(X)$ is called the configuration space of $X$. Question: if $X$ is connected, is $C_n(X)$ connected? Here is a simple example to illustrate the problem: if $X=[0,1]$, then $F_2(X)$ is the square minus its diagonal, hence not connected. However, $C_2(X)$ is connected, being a triangle. When $X$ is a manifold, the statement is true: in one dimension it is verified directly, and in more than one dimension even $F_n(X)$ is connected.

148956,Optimal sets for plane coloring problem,"There is a reasonably well-known problem: Given a plane with each point colored one of k colors, show there is a rectangle whose vertices are all of the same color, whose axes are parallel to the x- and y- axes A solution to this problem is to consider points in $\{0, 1, \ldots, k\} \times \{0, \ldots, \frac{k^2(k+1)}{2}\}$. From each row $\{0, \ldots, k\} \times \{j\}$ pick a pair $(a_j, j), (b_j,j)$, with $a_j<b_j$, of points that are of the same color, which must exist by pigeonholing. Since there are only $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ possible choices for $(a_j,b_j)$, for some pair $(a,b)$ there are at least $k+1$ values of $j$ such that $(a,b)=(a_j,b_j)$. Since there are $k$ colors, some pair $(j_1,j_2)$ of distinct values of $j$ among these have $(a,j_1)$ and $(a,j_2)$ of the same color, and the desired rectangle has vertex set $\{a,b\} \times \{j_1, j_2\}$. This actually proves something stronger, namely that there is a set of $\frac{k^4}{2}+k^3+\frac{k^2}{2}+k+1$ points that must contain vertices of a rectangle, oriented with the coordinate axes, which are all of the same color. It's also pretty clear that the $\frac{k^2(k+1)}{2}$ can't be improved upon with this method. On the other hand, the method seems inefficient, at least for large k. So my question is: Can one do better than $O(k^4)$? More explicitly, do there exist sets, of size $o(k^4)$, such that for any coloring of the plane with $k$ colors, the $k$-th such set must contain the vertices, all of the same color, of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes?

$\sigma_a(T_{|Y})\subseteq\sigma_a(T)$. However I think it is not true in general that $\sigma(T_{|Y})\subseteq\sigma(T)$. We also have $$
\partial(\sigma(T_{|Y}))\subseteq\sigma_a(T_{|Y})\subseteq\sigma_a(T)

Moreover, if $\sigma(T)$ is discrete then $\partial(\sigma(T_{|Y}))$ is also discrete, which implies that $\partial(\sigma(T_{|Y}))=\sigma(T_{|Y})$, so at least in this case the inclusion  $\sigma(T_{|Y})\subseteq\sigma(T)$ holds true.

149065,Examples of sufficient statistics for non-exponential family distributions?,"I know that the Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theorem says that only exponential family distributions have sufficient statistics whose dimension stays constant as the sample size increases. I further know that the Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem says that any distribution with a sufficient statistic can be factorized as 
$f(x;\theta) = h(x)\cdot g(T(x);\theta).$ Trivially, if $T(x)$ is a bijection, then $g$ could just invert $T$ and recover the whole original sample, and thus $T$ should be ""sufficient"". But the way the Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theorem is always stated raises what I think is an obvious question, but to which I can't seem to find a clear answer : Are there any distributions which have sufficient statistics which grow in dimension as the sample size grows, and which are ""lossy"" functions of their input data?

149139,Explaining why sin and cos are *not* at right angles,"Disclaimer: I'm an engineer, not a mathematician I recently had a fierce discussion (lots of blood) on electronics.stackexchange about phase shifts. The impedance of a resistor is real, that of a coil imaginary ($j\omega L$), so that adding 3V across a resistor and 4V across a coil in series results in a 5V overall. Now John (let's call him John) explained the same by using a sine and a cosine function, claiming they're at 90°. I can see where he gets this, and I tried the following to explain that the sine of a number and the cosine of a number are scalars , not vectors, so they can't have a phase difference: $$\sin(\omega t) = \dfrac{e^{j \omega t} - e^{- j \omega t}}{2j}$$ This is easy for me to visualize: $e^{\omega t}$ and $e^{- \omega t}$ are phasors rotating in opposite directions in the complex plane. Their difference is a vector on the imaginary axis. Dividing by $j$ rotates that vector by $\pi /2$ clockwise, so that it moves from the imaginary axis to the real axis. And then it's a sine, a scalar. Sitting nicely next to the cosine, no phase difference. My problem is that half a second ago it was still a vector. How does it become a scalar? Or do ""being a vector on the real axis"" and ""being a scalar"" mean the same thing?","['trigonometry', 'complex-numbers']"

How to find a suitable Cauchy-Riemann operator? Here $E$ is a smooth vector bundle over a compact Riemann surface $X$, and $\alpha(z)$ is a smooth function. Since the problem is dependent on the metric we have on $X$, we have to specify it. Let $X$ be the quotient of the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$ by a cocompact Fuchsian subgroup of the first kind, and the metric is the quotient of the hyperbolic metric on $\mathbb{H}$ by the action of the group. How to associate a Generalized Laplacian to a Cauchy-Riemann operator The first step is to define an $L^2$-scalar product in
  $\Omega^{0,0}(E)$ and $\Omega^{0,1}(E)$. The hyperbolic metric on $X$
  corresponds to an Hermitian metric $h$ on the holomorphic tangent
  space of $X$ , i.e. the subbundle $T^{1,0}(X)$ of the complex tangent
  bundle of $X$. This metric induces a metric on the dual of
  $T^{1,0}(X)$ , i.e. differential forms of type $(1,0)$, and, by
  complex conjugation, on forms of type $(0,1)$. By taking the exterior
  powers of this metric, and by tensoring with the Hermitian metric on
  $E$ we get a pointwise scalar Hermitian product $(s(x),t(x))$ for two
  sections of $\Omega^{0,i}(E)=\Omega^{0,i}(X) \otimes_{C^\infty(X)}
 \Gamma(X,E)$. On the other hand, let $\omega_0$ be the normalized
  Kähler form: $\omega_0=\frac{i}{2\pi}h(\frac{\partial}{\partial z},
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}) dz d\bar{z}$ Then the $L^2$ scalar product of two sections $s,t \in
\Omega^{0,i}(E)$ is defined by:
  $(s,t)_{L^2}=\int_X(s(x),t(x))\omega_0$. The second step consists in defining the operator $\bar{\partial}^*$
  in such a way that it is the $L^2$-adjoint of $\bar{\partial}$. So
  $\bar\partial^*:\Omega^{0,1}(E) \rightarrow \Omega^{0,0}(E)$ and
  $(s,\bar\partial^* t)_{L^2}=(\bar\partial s, t)_{L^2}$. Then the
  Laplace operator is defined by:
  $\Delta_n=\bar\partial^*\bar\partial:\Omega^{0,0}(E) \rightarrow
\Omega^{0,0}(E)$. This blockquote is a, more or less faithfully, quote from
  ""Lectures on Arakelov Geometry"" of Soulé, Abramovich, Burnol, Kramer.

Obviously Bertrand's Theorem is the statement that $\Pi(n) \geq 1$ for all $n$, and the PNT says that $\Pi(n) \approx \frac{n}{\log n}$ but doesn't provide a lower bound. It seems like Hoheisel's result on prime gaps that there exists a $\theta \lt 1$ such that $\pi(x+x^\theta)-\pi(x) \approx \frac{x^\theta}{\log x}$ (as seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Hoheisel ) should give a lower bound of the form $\Pi(n) \geq k\frac{n}{\log n}$ for some $k$ by stacking up $O(x^{1-\theta})$ such intervals; more precisely, if we take $c=2^{\theta}$ and $f(x) = x+x^\theta$, then since $x^\theta \leq cn^\theta$ for $x\leq 2n$, we have $f^{\circ t}(n) = f^{\circ(t-1)}(n) + \left(f^{\circ(t-1)}(n)\right)^\theta\leq f^{\circ(t-1)}(n) +cn^\theta\leq n+ctn^\theta$ as long as $ctn^\theta \lt n$ - or in other words, as long as $t\lt t_0 = c^{-1}n^{1-\theta}$, and therefore
$$\begin{align*}
\Pi(n) &= \pi(2n)-\pi(n)
\\ &\geq \sum_{i=0}^{t_0-1} \left(\pi(f^{\circ (i+1)}(n))-\pi(f^{\circ i}(n))\right)
\\ &\geq \sum_{i=0}^{t_0-1}\frac{(f^{\circ i}(n))^\theta}{\log f^{\circ i}(n)}
\\ &\geq \sum_{i=0}^{t_0-1}\frac{n^\theta}{\log n}
\\ &= t_0 \frac{n^\theta}{\log n}
\\ &= c^{-1}\frac{n}{\log n}
\end{align*}$$ Is this reasoning correct?  It makes sense to me, but I'm surprised I've never seen such an explicit lower bound given before.  While I'm more interested in the asymptotics, I'm also curious about the precise constants; if this is a known lower bound, is anything known about explicit $k$ such that $\Pi(n) \geq k\frac{n}{\log n}$ for all $n$ (or even all $n\gt n_0$)?","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"

One verifies immediately that one has equipped the set $F$ with the structure of a sheaf on $X^h$ , a sheaf which we denote by $F'$ . For each $x\in X$ , one then has $F'_{x} =F_{x}$ ; the sheaves $F$ and $F'$ only differ in their topologies ( $F'$ is nothing  more than the inverse image of $F$ under the continuous map $X^h \to X$ ). My questions are: (1) Is the definition of sheaf here same as that in Hartshorne? (2) What's the meaning of $ \pi: F \to X$ ? (3) Why $F'$ is the same as inverse image of $F$ (I understand this also as inverse image sheaf in the sense of Hartshorne)?","['algebraic-geometry', 'definition']"

Later (in 1.7.2 as well as 1.7.8) he asserts that this, plus the fact that $\mathcal{M}^s \cap i \mathcal{M}^s = \{0\}$ and $\mathcal{M}^s + i \mathcal{M}^s = \mathcal{M}$, imply that the adjoint map is weak-* continuous.  I'm afraid I don't quite follow. We know that $\mathcal{M}$ is the algebraic direct sum of the weak-* closed, real-linear subspaces $\mathcal{M}^s$ and $i \mathcal{M}^s$.  However, not every algebraic complement is a topological complement.  I don't know of many sufficient conditions for algebraic complements to automatically be topological.  One is that the space in question be Fréchet, but if $\mathcal{M}_*$ is infinite-dimensional then $\mathcal{M}$ cannot be weak-* Fréchet. The restriction of the adjoint map to the unit ball of $\mathcal{M}$ is continuous: If $x_\nu + i y_\nu \to x+iy$ is a convergent net in the unit ball with $x,y,x_\nu, y_\nu$ self-adjoint, then $x_\nu, y_\nu, x, y$ are also in the unit ball; given any subnet, there exists (by Alaoglu) a sub-subnet for which $x_\nu$ converges weak-* to some $\tilde{x}$ in the unit ball, and a sub-sub-subnet for which $y_\nu$ also converges weak-* to some $\tilde{y}$ in the unit ball.  (I'm using the same notation for all subnets instead of writing things like $x_{\nu_{\mu_{\eta_\zeta}}}$.)  Because $\mathcal{M}^s$ is weak-* closed, it follows that $\tilde{x}$ and $\tilde{y}$ are self-adjoint, and since the sub-sub-subnet $x_\nu + i y_\nu$ converges to both $x+iy$ and $\tilde{x} + i\tilde{y}$, it follows that $\tilde{x} = x$ and $\tilde{y} = y$.  Then (for this same sub-sub-subnet) one has $x_\nu - i y_\nu \to x-iy$.  Since every subnet of $x_\nu - i y_\nu$ has a further subnet converging to $x-iy$, we have $x_\nu - i y_\nu \to x-iy$. Not sure how to finish given the above remarks on the unit ball.  Given a weak-* convergent net $m_\nu \to 0$, the above would immediately imply $m_\nu^* \to 0$ weak-* as well if we made the additional assumption that the net $m_\nu$ is eventually bounded...but not all weak-* convergent nets are.  Or, for any weak-* closed convex set $F \subset \mathcal{M}$, let $F_r$ denote the intersection of $F$ with the ball of radius $r$, and we then get that $F_r^*$ is weak-* closed; by Krein-Smulyan, it follows that $F^*$ is weak-* closed.  However, most closed sets aren't convex. Of course, one approach would be to (without using continuity of the adjoint) develop the theory of $W^*$-algebras far enough to get a representation theorem, then use the ultraweak continuity of the adjoint map on $B(H)$.  I'd really rather have something more direct, though!  I have a feeling I'm overlooking something obvious.","['banach-spaces', 'c-star-algebras', 'operator-algebras', 'von-neumann-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
149770,Compact operator norm estimate,"I found the next exercise in Haim Brezis's book Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations. I feel like I solved the problem, but I'm not sure. The problem is: Let $E,F$ be two Banach spaces with norms $\|\cdot \|_E,\| \cdot \|_F$. Assume that $E$ is reflexive. Let $T :E \to F$ be a compact operator. Consider on $E$ another norm $| \cdot |$ weaker than $\|\cdot \|_E$, i.e. $|u|\leq C \|u\|_E$. Prove that for every $\varepsilon >0$ ther exists $C_\varepsilon>0$ such that
  $$ \|Tu\|_F \leq \varepsilon \|u\|_E +C_\varepsilon |u| $$ My approach is the following: Assume that the conclusion does not hold. Then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ and a sequence $u_n$ in $E$ such that
$$ \|Tu_n\|_F > \varepsilon \|u_n\|_E+n|u_n|$$ We can normalize the sequence such that $\|Tu_n\|=1$. Then $u_n$ is bounded in $E$, and because $E$ is reflexive then without loss of generality we can assume that $u_n$ converges weakly to $u \in E$. Since compact operators map weakly convergent sequences onto strongly convergent sequences it follows that $Tu_n \to Tu$ in $F$, so $\|Tu\|_F=1$, which means that $u\neq 0$. On the other hand $|u_n|<1/n$ so that $u_n$ converges to $0$ in the weaker norm $|\cdot |$. Is this enough to prove that $u=0$ and reach a contradiction? If my approach does not lead to a good end then what else should I try?","['normed-spaces', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis']"

149800,How do I calculate the number of different combinations of multiple sets' elements (different number of elements on each set)?,"First of all, I have no experience with mathematics, so my terminology may be wrong, but let me illustrate my question: Let's say that I have 4 different sets of elements: [apples, oranges, lemons]
[a, b, c, d, e]
[black, white, red, blue]
[1, 2] I want to find how many different combinations of the items there are. Notice: The combinations will always have 1 item from every list The 1st item in every combination will be chosen from the 1st list, the 2nd from the 2nd etc. So, basically the first 5 combinations would be: apples - a - black - 1 apples - a - black - 2 apples - a - white - 1 apples - a - white - 2 apples - a - red - 1 etc etc Sorry for not putting it in mathematical terms but I hope you understand what I'm trying to ask.",['combinatorics']
149803,Complex number: calculate $(1 + i)^n$.,"I have to solve the following complex number exercise: calculate $(1 + i)^n\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ giving the result in $a + ib$ notation. Basically what I have done is calculate $(1 + i)^n$ for some $n$ values.
$$(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i$$
$$(1 + i)^2 = 2i$$
$$(1 + i)^3 = - 2 + 2i$$
$$\boxed{(1 + i)^4 = - 4}$$
$$(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4\cdot(1 + i)^1 = (-4)\cdot(1 + i) = - 4 - 4i$$
$$(1 + i)^6 = (1 + i)^4\cdot(1 + i)^2 = (-4)\cdot2i = - 8i$$
$$(1 + i)^7 = (1 + i)^4\cdot(1 + i)^3 = (-4)\cdot(- 2 + 2i) = 8 - 8i$$
$$(1 + i)^8 = (1 + i)^4\cdot(1 + i)^4 = (-4)\cdot(-4) = (-4)^2 = 16$$
We can write $n = 4\cdot q + r$ (Euclidean division), so we have:
$$(1 + i)^n = (1 + i)^{(4\cdot q + r)} = ((1 + i)^4)^q\cdot(1 + i)^r = (-4)^q\cdot(1 + i)^r$$
Finally if you want to calculate say... $(1 + i)^n$ for $n = 625$ you have:
$$625 = 4\cdot156 + 1\Rightarrow q = 156, r = 1$$
$$(1 + i)^{625} = (-4)^{156}\cdot(1 + i)^1 = (-4)^{156} + (-4)^{156}i$$
What other approach would you suggest? Mine works, but you have to find $q$ and $r$ in order to do the calculation, and I think it is not ""calculate"" technically speaking which was what the exercise is asking (although I am not sure what they mean by calculate).","['complex-numbers', 'calculus']"
