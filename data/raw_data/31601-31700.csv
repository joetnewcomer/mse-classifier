297145,Riemannian metric. Help with notation.,"I was just reading about the hyperbolic space (upper-half plane model) and i'm getting kind of
confused about the notation for the Riemannian metric. The half-plane is defined as
$$
H = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | y > 0\},
$$
and the metric is defined as 
$$
ds^2 = \frac{dx^2 + dy^2}{y^2}.

297172,Something kind of like proving the euclidean Algorithm by induction,"Let a > b be positive integers. In applying the Euclidean algorithm,
we have $a = b q_0$ + $r_0$, $b = r_0 q_1 + r_1$, and $r_{n-1} = r_n q_{n+1} + r_{n+1}$, for all $n > 0$. Prove by induction that $r_n$ is in the set $\{ka + lb\}$  such that l and k are integers every $n>-1$ This i find very frustrating but i am horrible at induction :), i started with my base case's $s=0,1$ $r_0 = a - b q_0$ $b = r_0 q_1 r_1$ thus $r_1 = b - r_0 q_1$ from there i assume ( cause i have no idea what else to do) $r_1$ must divide b and $r_0$ which it should but may not be useful to me.
Now i assume that its true for $r_d$ and $r_{d-1}$ and want to show it for $r_s+1$ well  $r_{d+1} = r_{d-1} - r_d q_{d+1}$  and now im lost, though im fairly certain i was lost at prove by induction :) im certain if i can prove divisibility here with this step i can merely write a and b as multiples of $r_n$ and show that it divides the set. That being said i could very well be on the wrong track altogether any advice much appreciated.","['elementary-number-theory', 'induction', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Consider $H$ which is the subset of matrices of the form $$A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & b \\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$$ with $b$ an integer. Is $H$ a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb R)$? Explain your answer. well when $b = 0$ we have the identity, and $\det |A| = 1$ so it is invertible and the inverse is simply  $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & -b \\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$$ for all $b$ in the integers. I seem a little lost on closure. Clearly $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & -b \\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$$ multiplied by $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & a \\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$$ where $a$ is in the integers yields $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & -b+a \\ 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$$ and $a - b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers is an integer.

297317,Factorization over a relatively minimal surface,"Let $A$ be a DVR with an algebraically closed residue field $k$. Consider a morphism $f: X \to Y$ of arithmetic surfaces (regular integer projective and flat schemes over $A$ of dimension 2), such that $f$ induces a finite morphism on generic fibers. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are semistable, the generic fibers of $X$ and $Y$ are smooth, and $Y$ is relatively minimal, i.e. does not contain any exceptional divisor. Q: Is there any chance that $f$ factors through a birational map $X \to X'$, where $X'$ is a relatively minimal surface? As far I understand, the answer lies in the consideration of an irreducible component $C$ of the closed fiber $X_k$ of $X$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb P^1_k$ and intersects the other components of $X_k$ in exactly one point. With respect to the morphism $X \to X'$ the component $C$ is then contracted. If $f$ contracts $C$, so $f$ can possibly factor through $X'$. But in general (it seems to me) it could happen, that $f(C)$ is irreducible and intersects the other components of $Y_k$ in at least two points.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

For instance, when $r > 1$, the series above is painfully close the geometric series $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{r^n}$. But unfortunately, the $-\frac{1}{r^n}$ in the denominator makes each term $\frac{1}{r^n - \frac{1}{r^n}}$  somewhat larger than it's counterpart in the geometric series.

Actually I know that the trace of a symmetric positive definite matrix $S\in M_{m,m}$ is convex since we can find $B\in M_{n,m}$ such that $S=B^T\times B$ then we can write the trace as the sum of scalar quadratic forms, i.e. $\mathrm{trace}(S)=\mathrm{trace}(B^T\times B)=\sum_{j=1}^mb_j^T\times b_j$ where $b_j$ is the $j^{th}$ column of $B$. for instance if we have

The solution goes like this: For $x<a$, $y=Ae^{2x}+Be^{-2x}$, and because of the boundary condition, $B=0$, so $y=Ae^{2x}$. For $x>a$, $y=Ce^{2x}+De^{-2x}$, and because of the boundary condition, $C=0$, so $y=De^{-2x}$. At $x=a$, the solution must be continuous, so $Ae^{2a}=De^{-2a}$. Also, the integral from $a^-$ to $a^+$ of the LHS of the equation must be equal to the same integral of the RHS of the equation, which is 1. This gives the other needed equation for $A$ and $D$ from which we can easily find the general solution (I didn't write it as it is irrelevant for the question, but if anyone cares, the general solution is $y=-\dfrac{e^{-2|x-a|}}4$ for $y\neq a$). My question is: why must $y$ be continuous at $a$? 
An explanation that I have seen is the following: If $y$ had a simple discontinuity (finite jump) at $a$, then $y'$ would have a $\delta$-function singularity at $a$, and so would $y''$, but there is nothing in the equation to balance such a singularity. I think that this is an incorrect explanation, as $y''$ would actually have a -2-singularity at $x=a$, while $\delta$-singularity is -1-singularity. This offers an explanation, as the equation doesn't balance out -2-singularities, but is there a more rigorous and simpler proof why $y$ is continuous at $a$?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'continuity']"

We all know that numbers with infinite decimal expansion such as $0.\overline{3}$ or $0.\overline{1}$ are not necessarily  irrational. 
$$0.\overline{3}=0.333333\dots=\frac{1}{3}$$
$$0.\overline{1}=0.111111\ldots=\frac{1}{9}$$
Therefore we can say that for instance $0.\overline{4}$ is rational because we have:
$$0.\overline{4}=4\cdot 0.\overline{1}=\frac{4}{9}$$
My question is: can we generalize these results to any number that has a repeating pattern in its decimal expansion? Can we claim for instance that $0.\overline{123}=0.123123123\ldots$ is rational? This question boils down to asking whether or not expressions like $0.\overline{01}$ and $0.\overline{001}$ etcetera are rational. If so, in the case of my example we could say:
$$0.\overline{123}=123\cdot 0.\overline{001}$$
A naive thought of mine was that $0.\overline{01}$ is simply $\frac{1}{10}\cdot 0.\overline{1}$ but this is of course not true. Then I thought that maybe we can represent $0.\overline{01}$ as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{10^{2i}}$ which converges by the ratio test.

Does anyone know the explicit formula for the infinitesimal generator of $X_t$? As always, help is greatly appreciated. Edit: I should maybe mention that the result for the one-dimensional case is $$ \mathcal{A}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t,x) + \mu(t,x)\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(t,x) + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}(t,x)\frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}(t,x) + f_{\beta}(t,x)\lambda(t,x)\text{,}$$ where $$f_{\beta}(t,x) = f(t,x+\beta(t,x)) - f(t,x)\text{.}$$ The only thing that I really have no clue about is what the fourth term in the
previous equation looks like in the $n$-dimensional case.","['stochastic-processes', 'markov-process', 'stochastic-integrals', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus']"
298134,Approximation of Lipschitz functions on Riemannian manifolds,"Let $ (M,g) $ be a Riemannian manifold ($ g$ Riemannian metric) and let $ f: M \rightarrow R $ be a Lipschitz function (with respect to $ g $) with compact support. I want to study if it is possible to approximate $ f $ with smooth functions with compact support with respect to the norm of the Sobolev space $ H^p_1 $. I know an argument that solves the problem when $ M $ is complete. The argument is the following: Since $ f $ is a Lipschitz function with compact support then $ f \in H^p_1(M) $ (for every $ p \geq 1 $). Now, since $ M $ is complete the set of smooth functions with compact support is dense in $ H^p_1(M) $. Now my question: Is it possible to extend this result to non complete case? In detail if $ M $ is not complete, is it possible to approximate a lipschitz function with compact support (with respect to the norm of $ H^p_1 $) with smooth functions ($ C^\infty $) with compact support  ?

298136,Delta in continuity,"Let $f: [a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous, prove that it is uniform continuous. I know using compactness it is almost one liner, but I want to prove it without using compactness. However, I can use the theorem that every continuous function achieves max and min on a closed bounded interval. I propose proving that some choices of $\delta$ can be continuous on $[a,b]$ , for example but not restricted to: For an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ , for each $x\in[a,b]$ set $\Delta_x=\{0<\delta<b-a \;|\;|x-y|<\delta\Longrightarrow |f(x)-f(y)| <\epsilon\}$ , denote $\delta_x = \sup \Delta_x $ . Basically $\delta_x$ is the radius of largest neighborhood of $x$ that will be mapped into a subset of neighborhood radius epsilon of $f(x)$ . I'm trying to show that $\delta_x$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ with fixed $\epsilon$ . My progress is that I can show $\delta_y$ is bounded below if $y$ is close enough to $x$ , but failed to find its upper bound that is related to its distance with $x$ . Maybe either you could help me with this $\delta_x$ proof, or another cleaner proof without compactness (but allowed max and min). Thanks so much.","['metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

298159,Alternative definitions of stochastic processes?,"A stochastic process is defined as a family of random variables $\{X_t: \Omega \to S, t \in T\}$ , where $\Omega$ is a probability space, $T$ is a set, and $S$ is a measurable space.
Equivalently, a stochastic process can be defined as a mapping $X: \Omega \to S^T$ such that it is measurable with respect to the sigma algebra on the probability space $\Omega$ and the product sigma algebra on $S^T$. Now let me try to define a different kind of ""stochastic processes"", by replacing the sigma algebra on $S^T$ with a different one.
Suppose $A \subset S^T$ which is not necessarily measurable wrt the product sigma algebra on $S^T$. Now introduce the smallest sigma algebra $\mathcal M$ on $A$ such that $\forall t \in T$, the mapping $t: A\to S$ defined as $t(a): =a(t), \forall a \in A$ is measurable. Now define a ""stochastic process"" to be a measurable mapping $Y:\Omega \to A$ wrt the sigma algebras on $\Omega$ and on $A$. An example of such a ""stochastic process"" is a random measure, where $T$ is a sigma algebra, $S$ is $[0, \infty]$ and $A$ is a set of measures defined on $T$. My questions: When viewing a ""stochastic process"" $Y:\Omega \to A$ as a mapping
$Y:\Omega \to S^T$, is $Y$ not necessarily a stochastic process? If
possible, what conditions can make $Y$ a stochastic process? For example, can a random measure $Y:\Omega \to A$ be viewed as a
family of random variables $\{Y_C: \Omega \to [0, \infty], \forall C
    \in \mathcal M\}$? Is a stochastic process $X: \Omega \to S^T$ necessarily a
""stochastic process""? In other words,  on $S^T$, is the product
sigma algebra the same as the smallest sigma algebra on $S^T$ such that $\forall t \in T$, the mapping $t: S^T\to S$ defined as $t(f): =f(t), \forall f \in
    S^T$ is measurable? Added: Yes, I think it is. Because product sigma
algebra is defined to make projections measurable. Thanks and regards!","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes']"
298177,"The ""architecture"" of a finite group","I think that the aim of finite group theory is the following: Given an arbitrary finite group $G$ , study completely the subgroup structure of $G$ . There are at least two ways to achieve this purpose: 1) The approach with simple groups. Thanks to the Jordan-Holder theorem, once that all simple groups are classified, then,  at least theoretically, all finite groups are known. But practically, given the composition factors of a finite group it is very hard (I think that cohomology is necessary) to find the set of groups having those composition factors. However, non-isomorphic groups can have the same composition factors. So my first question is: why is it so important to classify all finite simple groups, even if it is difficult to go back to the finite group from its composition factors? 2) The approach with the generalized Fitting subgroup. If $G$ is a finite group, a normal cc-subgroup ( $H$ is a $cc$ -subgroup of $G$ if $C_G(H)\le H$ ) controls the structure of $G$ . In fact ,if $H$ is a $cc$ -subgroup of $G$ , and  the structure of $H$ is known, then $G/H$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $Out(H)$ . Clearly, if one finds a $cc$ -subgroup that is particularly amenable, then it is simple to investigate the structure of the whole $G$ . If $G$ is solvable, the Fitting theorem ensures that $F(G)$ is a characteristic $cc$ -subgroup so, since $F(G)$ is the direct product of $p$ -groups, the study of all solvable finite groups is reduced to study all $p$ -groups and their automorphisms.
If $G$ is a generic finite group, Bender introduced the generalized Fitting subgroup $$F^*(G)=F(G)E(G)$$ that is a characteristic $cc$ -subgroup. My second question is the following: What can you say about the group $E(G)$ (generated by all components of $G$ )? Is it easy to study its structure?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'simple-groups']"

298193,What does relaxing the iid assumptions mean? Intuitive and technical perspectives.,I believe the most restrictive assumption we can place on a series of observations is that they are iid. It is possible to relax these assumptions. For example relaxing the independent distribution results in independent heterogeneously distributed random variables. In other words the distribution of each random variables can itself vary. What does this mean? There must be some importance or we would not bother to specify the properties of the distribution. Can the distribution depend on preceding observations or would this break the independent observation restriction that we still have in place? Can anyone think of any intuitive examples to help explain this (in the same way that tossing a fair coin or rolling a fair die are good examples of iid observations) and any important statistical concepts that arise out of relaxing this assumption? My degree is not in statistics although I am quite interested in this subject. Thank you all so much.,"['statistics', 'random']"

298231,My answer to a combination problem is different from the textbook answer.,"The question in full goes as follows: How many $5$-digit numbers can be formed from the integers $1,2,\dots,9$ if no digit can appear more than twice? (For instance, $41434$ is not allowed.) I put my answer as the sum of three subsets (no repetition, one pair, and two pairs). The number of possibilities for no reps is $9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5$. The # of possibilities for one pair is $\binom94$. If there's a pair, then there are $4$ distinct digits in the $5$-digit number. Multiply this by $5!/2$, since each digit will need a place, which is calculated by $5!$. Divide by $2$ to remove redundancy of the digits in the pair. Likewise, the third set goes $\binom93\cdot5!/(2\cdot2)$. The sum of the three subsets being: $$9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5 + \binom94\cdot\frac{5!}2 + \binom93\cdot\frac{5!}{2\cdot2}$$ The answer at the back of the book goes: There are $\binom52\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6$ numbers in which only one specified digit appears twice, so there are $9\cdot\binom52\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6$ numbers in which only a single digit appears twice. There are $7\cdot5!/(2!\cdot2!)$ numbers in which two specified digits appear twice, so there are $\binom92\cdot7\cdot5!/(2!\cdot2!)$ numbers in which two digits appear twice. Thus, the answer is $$9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5 + 9\binom52\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6 + \binom92\cdot7\cdot\frac{5!}{2\cdot2}$$ The answer makes sense to me, but mine doesn't seem wrong either.
