  form $g(z)=(x,y)$ in the neighbourhood of the origin. $$\begin{cases}

Let $F:ℝ^3\rightarrow ℝ^2, F(x,y,z)=(xyz+\sin(xyz),x+y+z).$ If we consider the function $F$, we notice that $F(\epsilon,-\epsilon,0)=(0,0)$ $∀\epsilon>0$.
Because we can choose $\epsilon$ to be arbitrarily small,  $\nexists{R>0}$ such that n-hood of the origin $B(0,R)$ would contain a unique solution $(x,y,z)=(g(z),z)$ such that $F(x,y,z)=0$.

2016831,"If $1\le\lambda \le \kappa$ are cardinals, with $\kappa$ infinite and $\lambda<\text{cf}(\kappa)$, then every map $\lambda\to\kappa$ is bounded","I'm trying to prove the statement in the title, which is a step in the proof of a lemma in Kunen's The Foundations of Mathematics . Proceeding by contradiction, let $f:\lambda\to\kappa$ be unbounded, and put $X=\text{ran}(f)$. Since $\sup X=\kappa$, we have, by definition of cofinality
$$\lambda<\text{cf}(\kappa)\le \text{type}(X)$$
Now, since $\text{cf}(\kappa)$ is regular, it is a cardinal, and since $\lambda$ is also a cardinal, we deduce that $\lambda \prec \text{cf}(\kappa)$, i.e. there is no injection from $\lambda$ into $\kappa$. Then, since $f$ is a surjection from $\lambda$ onto $X$ (I'm assuming Choice throughout this whole question)
$$\lambda\prec \text{cf}(\kappa)\preceq\text{type}(X)\preceq \lambda$$
which is a contradiction (note the subtle change in typography from $<$ to $\prec$). Is this argument correct? Is there any easier way to see it? Kunen does not have a tendency to make huge leaps, and while this isn't too difficult, he offers no justification, which is a tad strange.

Prove that there exists a vector field $X\in\frak{X}$$(M)$ such that $X(f)\equiv 1$. Take a chart $(U, \phi)$ at $p\in M$ with $U$ small enough so that we can assume, with no loss in generality, that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi^{n}}\neq 0$ in $U$ (that's possible since $f$ is non singular).

2017058,How to show complement of measurable set is measurable with this definition of measurability.,"I've been working through an exercise which deals with showing that two definitions of a set being Lebesgue measurable are equivalent. The definition that I was thinking about was the following: $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is measurable if for every $\epsilon$ there is a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ with $m_{*}(E-F)<\epsilon$. The $m_{*}$ is the outer measure obtained from taking the infimum of the total volume of rectangular covers. I am having trouble showing that the compliment $E^{c}$ is also measurable when $E$ is measurable My hunch is to show that $E^{c}$ is the intersection of such measurable sets. One observation I made is that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have a closed set $F_{n}$ such that $m_{*}(E-F_{n}) < \epsilon$ If we set $O_{n}=F_{n}^{c}$ and $S=\bigcap_{n=1} O_{n}$, I think we should be might be able to show that $E^{c}=S$ or use $S$ in some way to show that $E^{c}$ is measurable.

2017394,"Is a function with values in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$ an element of $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega\times(0,T))$?.","The question is in the end of the post. First, I need some preliminary considerations. In the Temam's book (as well as in the Dautray's book ), the author proves that there exists $u\in C([0,T];H)\cap L^2(0,T;V)$ with $u'\in L^2(0,T;V')$ such that
$$u_t(t)-Au(t)=f(t)\quad\text{in}\quad V',\qquad\forall\ t\in(0,T),\tag{1}$$
where $f\in L^2(0,T;V')$ is given and $A:V\to V'$ is the operator defined by $$\langle Av,w\rangle_{V',V}=(v,w)_{H_0^1(\Omega)},\quad\forall \ v,w\in V.$$
The spaces are defined by $V={\overline{\mathcal{V}}}^{H^1(\Omega)\times H^1(\Omega)}$ and $H={\overline{\mathcal{V}}}^{L^2(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)}$, where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with smooth boundary and
$$\mathcal{V}=\{v\in\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\times\mathcal{D}(\Omega)\mid\operatorname{div} v=0\}.$$ After proving existence the author considers the functions
$$U(t)=\int_0^tu(s)\;ds,\qquad F(t)=\int_0^Tf(s)\;ds.$$
From the regularity of $u$ and $f$ we have $U\in C([0,T];V)$ and $F\in C([0,T];V')$. And integrating $(1)$ we get
$$u(t)-u(0)-AU(t)=F(t)\quad\text{in}\quad V',\qquad\forall \ t\in(0,T).$$
This implies
$$\langle u(t)-u(0)-\Delta U(t)-F(t),v\rangle_{V',V}=0,\quad\forall\ v\in V,\;t\in(0,T).$$
Identifynig (by extension) $S(t):=u(t)-u(0)-\Delta U(t)-F(t)$ with a element of $H^{-1}(\Omega)$, it follows as consequence of the "" Rham's Theorem "" that, for each $t\in (0,T)$, there exists $P(t)\in\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$ such that
$$u(t)-u(0)-\Delta U(t)-F(t)=\nabla P(t)\quad\text{in}\quad\mathcal{D}'(\Omega).\tag{2}$$ After justifying that $\nabla P\in C([0,T]; [H^{-1}(\Omega)]^2)$ and $P\in C([0,T];L^2(\Omega))$, the author says that we can ""differentiate $(2)$ in the $t$ variable, in the distribution sense in $Q:=\Omega\times (0,T)$"", which yields
$$u_t-\Delta u-f=\nabla p\quad\text{in}\quad\mathcal{D}'(Q),\tag{3}$$
where $p=\partial_t P$. Question: It is not clear for me how to get $(3)$ from $(2)$. To differenciate $(2)$ with respect to $t$ in the sense of $\mathcal{D}'(Q)$ we need to indentify the terms of $(2)$ with elements of $\mathcal{D}'(Q)$ , right? How is this identification made? To prove $(3)$ we have to show that, for each $\varphi\in \mathcal{D}(Q)$, 
  $$\langle u_t-\Delta u-f,\varphi\rangle=\langle \nabla (\partial_t P),\varphi\rangle.$$

=\langle \partial_t (\nabla P), \varphi\rangle

Then for every Cauchy sequence on $X$ we can define the family of sets $$\mathcal B:=\{B_k:B_k=\overline{\Bbb B}(x_N,1/k), k\in\Bbb N_{>0}\land B_0=X\}$$ what is a family of nested closed sets with the property of non-empty finite intersection. Then if $\bigcap\mathcal B\neq\emptyset$ then $X$ is complete, i.e every Cauchy sequence converges in $X$ . $X$ is totally bounded: if $X$ is not totally bounded then exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that doesnt exists a finite open cover of $X$ composed of open balls with centers in $X$ . Then for some $\epsilon>0$ the family $$C_\epsilon :=\{\Bbb B(x,\epsilon):x\in X\}$$ doesn't contain a finite subcover. Now define the family composed by the complements of $C_\epsilon$ : $$C_\epsilon^*:=\{(\Bbb B(x,\epsilon))^\complement:x\in X\}$$ then observe that the family $C_\epsilon^*$ have the finite intersection property because in other case $C_\epsilon$ would have a finite subcover. But we have that $$\bigcap C_\epsilon^*=\bigcap (\Bbb B(x,\epsilon))^\complement=\left(\bigcup \Bbb B(x,\epsilon)\right)^\complement=X^\complement=\emptyset$$ what is a contradiction about the assumptions on $X$ , then $X$ is totally bounded. Because $X$ is totally bounded and complete then is compact. $\Box$ Can you check this proof please and comment any dubious or wrong step? If you know some alternative proof easier to this approach it will be very interesting to see it.

2017720,The relationships between Prime number and Fibonacci number,"Dears,
Recently when learning programming language, I accidentally found out an interesting relationship between prime number and Fibonacci number.
That is, a positive integer number can be analyzed as either 
-   the sum of a prime number and a Fibonacci number 
For example 
16 = 11 (prime) + 5 (Fibonnaci)
61 = 59 (prime) + 2 (Fibonacci)
-   or a prime number minus a Fibonacci number
For example
59 = 61 (prime) – 2 (Fibonacci)
83 = 227 (prime) – 144 (Fibonacci) I have tried with the first 1,000 positive integer number from 1 to 1,000 MANUALLY and ensured that all of them matched with one of the two above rules. I shared my analyzing here in the excel file with 1,000 positive integer number from 1 to 1,000 with the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzAetX6K_uyAUXZHQTd5V3ZIa2c/view?usp=sharing The majority of them belong to the first case are formatted with normal writing. I set the minority cases (the second one where result equals to prime minus Fibonacci) with red and bold format. So prime number and Fibonacci number are in actual not completely independent with each other. It is perfect if anyone can prove this rule in general case, or explain its reason.

Here dim$(T^*M) = 2n$. Differently said, there exists a lift $\tilde{\tau}$ of the classifying map $\tau$ as follows: The Question Is there a simple (topological) argument, why such lifts always exist for cotangent bundles?

Therefore, ""highly"" equivalent functions satisfying the hypotheses must have differences which tend to $0$ . That's not sufficient, though. For example, $f(x) = x$ , $g(x) = x + \frac 1x$ fails for $n=2$ .","['asymptotics', 'calculus', 'limits']"

A map $f:X \to Y$ is called an arcwise isometry if $L(f(\gamma))=L(\gamma)$ for every path $\gamma$. In the book ""A course in metric geometry"" (Burago & Burago & Ivanov) it is claimed that an arcwise isometry that is a local homeomorphism is a local isometry. A map $f : X \to Y$ is called a local isometry at $x ∈ X$ if $x$
has a neighborhood $U$  such that the restriction $\left.f\right|_U$ maps $U$ isometrically onto an open set $V$ in $Y$. In other words 
the map $\left.f\right|_U:(U,\left.d^X\right|_U) \to (V,\left.d^Y\right|_V)$ is an isometry. (Note that we are using the restrictions of the metrics on $X,Y$, not the induced intrinsic distances which only allow for paths that stay inside $U,V$). A map which is a local isometry at every point
is called a local isometry. I do not see why this is needs to be true. I think there is a problem if points in $Y$ don't have convex neighbourhoods. Indeed, let $p \in X$. There exists open sets $p \in U \subseteq X,f(p) \in V \subseteq Y$ such that $f:U \to V$ is a homeomorphism. Since $f$ is an arcwise isometry, it is $1$-Lipschitz, so $$ (1)\, \, d^Y(f(p),f(q)) \le d^X(p,q)$$ Even if we knew $f^{-1}:V \to U$ also preserves lengths the only thing we could conclude is that $$  (2)\, \,  d^X(p,q) \le d^U(p,q) \le d^V(f(p),f(q))$$ (where $d^U,d^V$ are the intrinsic metrics induced on $U$,$V$) However, if $V$ is not convex then it's possible that $ d^V(f(p),f(q)) > d^Y(f(p),f(q))$ so we don't have a way to combine inequalities $(1)$ and $(2)$.

2019139,Parallelogram / Polarization Inequality,"Dear Math Experts, as a stepping stone for another result I am interested in the following generalization of the parallelogram / polarization equality for Hilbert spaces. Denote by $H$ a Hilbert space over the real numbers $R$ and by $B = \{ u \in H : \Vert u \Vert \leq 1\}$ the closed unit ball in $H$.
The inner product is denoted by $\langle , \rangle$.
I am now after the following statement: For any fixed vectors $x,y \in H$ we have
\begin{align}
-\Vert x - y \Vert^2 \leq 2\Vert x \Vert \langle u, x \rangle + 2\Vert y \Vert \langle u, y \rangle - \Vert x + y \Vert \langle u, x + y \rangle \leq \Vert x - y \Vert^2
\end{align}
for all $u \in B$.
For $u$ such that $\Vert u \Vert < 1$ equality holds if and only if $x = y$. Any ideas related to my own proof strategy (see below) or otherwise are very welcome. My own attempt so far:
I can deal with the cases $x=y$ and $x = 0 \neq y$ and I therefore assume $0 \neq x \neq y \neq 0$ in the following.
As a further observation we can regard the part in the middle as function of $u$ and rewrite in terms of the inner product as $f_{x,y}(u) = \langle u, (2\Vert x\Vert - \Vert x+y \Vert)x + (2\Vert y\Vert - \Vert x+y \Vert)y \rangle$.
Using Cauchy-Schwarz and $\Vert u \Vert \leq 1$ we then have 
\begin{align}
-L(x,y) \leq f_{x,y}(u) \leq L(x,y)
\end{align}
with $L(x,y) = \Vert (2\Vert x\Vert - \Vert x+y \Vert)x + (2\Vert y\Vert - \Vert x+y \Vert)y \Vert$.
The statement is then equivalent to $L(x,y) \leq \Vert x - y \Vert^2$. Of course a result for general $H$ would be very interesting, but my own attempts have so far focused on the finite dimensional case $H = R^d$ with $\langle x,y \rangle = x^T y$ which is fine for my particular application.
We can now use that for any positive scalar $s$ and any rotation matrix $A$ we have $L(sAx,sAy) = s^2 L(x,y)$ as well as $\Vert sAx - sAy \Vert^2 = s^2 \Vert x - y\Vert^2$. Assuming $0 \neq x \neq y \neq 0$ we then find a rotation matrix $A$ and the strictly positive scaling factor $s = 1 / \Vert x \Vert$ such that $sAx = e = (1,0,\ldots,0)$.
Wlog we then only consider $L(e,y) \leq \Vert e - y \Vert^2$ for any $y \in R^d$.
Therefore I need to show that $h(y) = \Vert e - y \Vert^2 - L(e,y) \geq 0$ at which point I am stuck.
I know that for $\alpha \geq 0$ we have $h(\alpha e) = 0$ which I believe is the lowest function value.","['real-analysis', 'inequality', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus']"

expansion of: $(1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)?$ My attempt: since there are $3$ brackets to choose factors of $x^3$ from, we can say the following: $ x^3 = x^a x^b x^c, a \in \{0,1,2,3\}, b \in \{0,2\}, c \in \{0,3\}$ The coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion will equal the number of solutions satisfying $ x^3 = x^a x^b x^c$. $a=0 \Rightarrow b=0 $ and $ c=3$, $a=1 \Rightarrow b=2 $ and $ c=0$, $a=2 \Rightarrow$ no solution. $a=3 \Rightarrow b=0 $ and $ c=0$, $\Rightarrow$ the coefficient of $x^3$ is $3$ which equals the number of partitions of $3$. Do I understand what the question is asking? Because I'm wondering if just multiplying the brackets and obtaining the coefficient is an equivalent solution to the question.

2019226,Two tails in a row - what's the probability that the game started with a head?,"We're tossing a coin until two heads or two tails in a row occur. The game ended with a tail. What's the probability that it started with a head? Let's say we denote the game as a sequence of heads and tails, e.g. $(T_1, H_2, T_3, H_5, H_6)$ is a game that started with a tail and ended with a head.
In this notation, I need to find $P(H_1 | T_{n-1}T_{n})$. $$P(H_1 | T_{n-1}T_{n}) = \dfrac{P(H_1 \cap T_{n-1}T_{n})}{P(T_{n-1}T_{n})}$$ For a given $n$, there is exactly one sequence starting with a head and ending with two tails: $(H_1, T_2, H_3, ..., H_{n-2}, T_{n-1}, T_n)$ - this is the event mentioned in the numerator. Now, there are two options for the event in the denominator: either the game is $(H_1, T_2, H_3, ..., H_{n-2}, T_{n-1}, T_n)$, or $(T_1, H_2, T_3, ..., H_{n-2}, T_{n-1}, T_n)$ - they differ in length by 1, though. How do I calculate their probabilities? I was thinking of calculating discrete probabilities of sequences of length $n$, but since there are two options for the last event, I'm not sure how it'll work.","['independence', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

2019395,Have I developed new elliptic functions?,"While tinkering with the log-derivative of the function \begin{align}\varphi(z,q)&=2e^{-\pi qz^2-\pi q/4}\sinh\pi qz \prod_{k\ge1}(1-e^{-2k\pi q})(1-e^{-2k\pi q+2\pi qz})(1-e^{-2k\pi q-2\pi qz})\tag1\\
&=\frac2{\sqrt{q}}e^{-\tfrac{\pi}{4q}}\sin \pi z \prod_{k\ge1}(1-e^{-2k\pi/q})(1-e^{-2k\pi/q+2i\pi z})(1-e^{-2k\pi/q-2i\pi z})\tag2
\end{align} I found I could create a function around its moment integral (with an additional constant $\alpha$): $$u_n(z,\alpha;q)=\exp{\int_0^\alpha y^n \dfrac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(y+z,q)\,dy}\tag3$$
I also know that $\varphi(z+i/q,q)=-e^{\pi/q-2i\pi z}\varphi(z,q)$ and $\varphi(z+1,q)=-\varphi(z,q)$ (each following respectively from $(1)$ and $(2)$) and so $$\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(z+i/q,q)=-2i\pi+\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(z,q),\qquad\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(z+1,q)=\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(z,q)$$
If I plug these into $(3)$ I'll get \begin{align}u_n(z+i/q,\alpha,q)&=\exp\int_0^\alpha y^n\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(y+z+i/q,q)\,dy\\
&=\exp\int_0^\alpha y^n\left(-2i\pi+\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(y+z,q)\right)\,dy\\
&=e^{-2i\pi\alpha^{n+1}/(n+1)}u_n(z,\alpha,q)\end{align} and \begin{align}u_n(z+1,\alpha,q)&=\exp\int_0^\alpha y^n\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(y+z+1,q)\,dy\\
&=\exp\int_0^\alpha y^n\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(y+z,q)\,dy\\
&=u_n(z,\alpha,q)\end{align}
But I've noticed that $\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}$ satisfies similar properties:
\begin{align}\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha+i/q,q)}{\varphi(z+i/q,q)}&=\frac{-e^{\pi/q-2i\pi(z+\alpha)}\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{-e^{\pi/q-2i\pi z}\varphi(z,q)}=e^{-2i\alpha\pi}\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\\
\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha+1,q)}{\varphi(z+1,q)}&=\frac{-\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{-\varphi(z,q)}=\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\end{align}
So with the right exponents, I can combine them into a doubly periodic function:\begin{align}e_n(z,\alpha,q):&=\left[\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}u_n^{-n-1}(z,\alpha,q)\tag4\\
&\\
e_n(z+1,\alpha,q)&=\left[\frac{-\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{-\varphi(z,q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}u_n^{-n-1}(z+1,\alpha,q)\\
&=\left[\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}u_n^{-n-1}(z,\alpha,q)\\
&=e_n(z,\alpha,q)\\
&\\
e_n(z+i/q,\alpha,q)&=\left[e^{-2\alpha i\pi}\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}u_n^{-n-1}(z+i/q,\alpha,q)\\
&=e^{-2i\pi\alpha^{n+1}}\left[\frac{\varphi(z+\alpha,q)}{\varphi(z,q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}e^{2i\pi\alpha^{n+1}}u_n^{-n-1}(z,\alpha,q)\\
&=e_n(z,\alpha,q)\end{align}
But the strangest property of $e_n$ follows from a transformation for $\varphi(z,q)$: $$\varphi(z,q)=-iq^{-1/2}e^{-\pi qz^2}\varphi(iqz,1/q)$$ which leads to \begin{align}e_n(z,\alpha,q)&=\left[\frac{-iq^{-1/2}e^{-\pi q(z+\alpha)^2}\varphi(iq(z+\alpha),1/q)}{-iq^{-1/2}e^{-\pi qz^2}\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}\\
&\quad\exp\Big[-(n+1)\int_0^\alpha y^n\left\{-2\pi q(y+z)+iq\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(iqy+iqz,1/q)\right\}\,dy\Big]\\[2ex]
&=e^{-\pi q\alpha^n(\alpha^2+2\alpha z)}\left[\frac{\varphi(iqz+\alpha iq,1/q)}{\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}\\
&\quad\exp\Big[\left\{2\pi q\alpha^{n+2}\cdot\frac{n+1}{n+2}+2\pi qz\alpha^{n+1}-iq(n+1)\int_0^\alpha y^n\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(iqy+iqz,1/q)\,dy\right\}\Big]\\[2ex]
&=e^{n\alpha^{n+1}\pi q/(n+2)}\left[\frac{\varphi(iqz+\alpha iq,1/q)}{\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}\exp\int_0^{\alpha iq}-(n+1)(iq)^{-n}x^n\frac{\varphi'}{\varphi}(x+iqz,1/q),dx\\
&=e^{n\alpha^{n+1}\pi q/(n+2)}\left[\frac{\varphi(iqz+\alpha iq,1/q)}{\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}u_n^{-(n+1)(iq)^{-n}}(iqz,\alpha iq,1/q)\\
&=e^{n\alpha^{n+1}\pi q/(n+2)}\left[\frac{\varphi(iqz+\alpha iq,1/q)}{\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{\alpha^n}\left[\frac{\varphi(iqz+\alpha iq, 1/q)}{\varphi(iqz,1/q)}\right]^{-\alpha^n}e_n^{(iq)^{-n}}(iqz,\alpha iq,1/q)\\
&=e^{\alpha^{n+1}n\pi q/(n+2)}e_n^{(iq)^{-n}}(iqz,\alpha iq,1/q)
\end{align}
I would like to know the degrees of the zeros and poles of $e_n$ so I can determine its Mittag-Leffler expansion. The above transformation appears to change their nature, so this may prove to be very thorny. [Edit] I have found a tractable form for $e_1(z,\alpha;q)$ using the formula \begin{align}\exp\int_0^z\ln\varphi(y,q)\,dy=&e^{\pi qz^3/3-\pi z(q+q^{-1})/6}\varphi^z(z,q)\\
&\cdot\prod_{k\ge1}\underbrace{\bigg(\frac{1-e^{-2k\pi q-2\pi qz}}{1-e^{-2k\pi q+2\pi qz}}\bigg)^k}_{p_1(z,q)}\underbrace{\bigg(\frac{1-e^{-2k\pi/q+2i\pi z}}{1-e^{-2k\pi/q-2i\pi z}}\bigg)^{ik/q}}_{p_2(z,q)}:\tag5

2019467,Finding the image of extended lines under the function $f(z)=\bigl(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\bigr)^{2}$ using a Möbius transformation,"Given the function $f(z)=\bigl(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\bigr)^{2}$ when $f(1)=\infty,f(\infty)=1$, I need to find the image of the extended real line and the extended imaginray line. In order to do so, I worked with the Möbius transformation $\psi(z)=\frac{z+1}{z-1}$. Finding the image of the extended real line was easy- as a Möbius transformation sends extended circles to extended circles in $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ which are characterized by three points, I found the image of three points on the extended real line to be on the extended real line (from here I'll use e.r.l), so $\psi(z)$ sends the e.r.l to itself. 
$f(z)=(\psi(z))^{2}$ thus sends the e.r.l to the positive half of the e.r.l in $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$. Now, for finding the image of the extended imaginary line (e.i.l) in $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$, I used the same reasoning and got: $\psi(i)=\frac{i+1}{i-1}=\frac{-(i+1)^{2}}{2}, \psi(0)=-1, \psi(-i)=\frac{-i+1}{-i-1}=\frac{-(i-1)^{2}}{2}$. So the e.i.l is sent by $\psi$ to a circle going through $\frac{-(i+1)^{2}}{2},\frac{-(i-1)^{2}}{2},-1$. Before I go through the quite tedious work of finding the equation of the circle, a troubling thought came to my mind. Say I have the circle. I need to find the image under $f(z)=(\psi(z))^2$. Should I square the circle?","['complex-analysis', 'mobius-transformation']"

$$\begin{aligned}\infty=\frac{1}{R}\,\mathbb{E}\big[|X_1|\big] &=\frac{1}{R}\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}}\mathbb{P}(|X_1|\geq x)\,\mathrm{d}x \\ &=\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}}\mathbb{P}(|X_1|\geq Rx)\,\mathrm{d}x \quad (x\mapsto Rx)\\ & =\sum_n\int_n^{n+1}\mathbb{P}(|X_1|\geq Rx)\,\mathrm{d}x\\ &\leq\sum_n\int_n^{n+1}\mathbb{P}(|X_1|\geq Rn)\,\mathrm{d}x\quad \big(\mathbb{P}(|X|>a)\geq\mathbb{P}(|X|>b)\;\text{if}\;a<b\big)\\ &=\sum_n\mathbb{P}(|X_1|\geq Rn)\\& =\sum_n\mathbb{P}(|X_n|\geq Rn)\quad (X_1\sim X_n\;\text{for all}\;n)\end{aligned}$$
