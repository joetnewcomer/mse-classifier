Let $A$ and $B$ be two $k$-algebras, ie. two rings that are also $k$-vector spaces and their multiplication is $k$-bilinear. Any isomorphism of $k$-algebras is also a ring isomorphism, so if $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic as $k$-algebras, they are isomorphic as rings. I would guess that the converse fails. Is there any example of $A$ and $B$ that are isomorphic as rings, but not as $k$-algebras? The reason I came up with this question is the following.

855225,"The principle $S_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ versus the game $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$","Given a topological space $X$, Let $\mathcal O$, denote the set of all open covers of $X$. We say that a space $X$ satisfies $S_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$, if for every sequence of open covers $\{ \mathcal U_n : n \in \mathbb N \}$, there exists a sequence of open sets $\{ U_n :  U_n \in \mathcal U_n \text{ for each } n \in \mathbb N \}$, which is an open cover of $X$. Let $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ be the game with the following rules: There are two players: ONE and TWO. At each odd step $2n-1$, where $n \in \mathbb N$, ONE picks an open cover $\mathcal U_{2n-1}$ of $X$. At each even step $2n$, where $n \in \mathbb N$, TWO responds by picking an open set $U_{2n} \in \mathcal U_{2n-1}$ If the sequence $\{ U_{2n} : n \in \mathbb N \}$ is an open cover of $X$ then TWO wins. If the sequence $\{ U_{2n} : n \in \mathbb N \}$ is not an open cover of $X$ then ONE wins. A strategy for ONE, is a function $F$, that, given any initial finite sequence of moves, $\{ \mathcal U_1, U_2, \mathcal U_3, U_4,...,U_{2n-2} \}$ of the game, produces the next move $\mathcal U_{2n-1}$. A winning strategy for ONE, is a strategy $F$, such that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U_{2n}$ is never a cover of $X$.

We say that a topological space $X$ satisfies $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ if TWO has a winning strategy for $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ in $X$. I am trying to prove the claim below and have mannaged to prove only one direction. Any help? This claim is some lighter version of theorem 3 in this article. Claim: $X$ satisfies $S_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ if and only if TWO has a winning strategy for $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ in $X$. Proof: First direction: Suppose that TWO has a winning strategy for $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ in $X$. Then, Given a sequence $\mathcal U_{2n-1} = \{ \mathcal U_1, \mathcal U_3, \mathcal U_5, ...  \}$ of open covers of $X$, Start with $\{ \mathcal U_1 \}$, and let $U_2 = F(U_1)$, where $F$ is the winning strategy for TWO. Then, take $U_4 = F(\mathcal U_1,U_2,\mathcal U_3)$, at the $n$'th step, $U_{2n} = F(\mathcal U_1,U_2, \mathcal U_3,U_4,...,\mathcal U_{2n-1})$. It is clear that $\bigcup U_{2n}$ is an open cover of $X$ since $F$ is a winning strategy. Second direction: Suppose that $X$ satisfies $S_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$. Then, for every sequence of open covers $\mathcal U_n$ of $X$, there is a sequence $\{ U_n : U_n \in \mathcal U_n, n \in \mathbb N \}$, such that $\bigcup U_n$ is an open cover of $X$. We have to show that TWO has a winning strategy in the game $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$. So, how can I build this strategy?

855227,Interpreting higher order differentials,"I'm trying to understand Taylor's Theorem for functions of $n$ variables, but all this higher dimensionality is causing me trouble. One of my problems is understanding the higher order differentials. For example, if I have a function $f(x, y)$, then it's first differential is: $$df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy.$$ To me this quantity is saying that: A differential change in the value of function $f(x,y)$ is equal to how fast function $f(x,y)$ is changing
  with respect to $x$ multiplied by a differential change in the 
  $x$-coordinate plus how fast function $f(x,y)$ is changing with
  respect to $y$ multiplied by a differential change in the 
  $y$-coordinate. This seems intuitive. But when we get into higher order differentials I get confused: $$d^2f= \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y ^2}dy^2 + 2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}dy\:dx + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x ^2}dx^2$$ How would one interpret this quantity?

855259,"Ellipticity of Ricci tensor, does it depend on coordinates?","Well, I am afraid this is a silly question because I know the answer must be 'yes, it does'. But I don't see why. I put the problem in context. The ricci tensor can be regarded as a differential operator acting of metrics (it is an expression that depends on second and first derivatives of the metric). You give the ricci a metric on your manifold $M$ an the ricci gives you a symmetric two tensor. It is non linear.
$$
Ric: \{\text{metrics on } M\} \to \{\text{symmetric two-tensors on }M\}
$$
So one says that the ricci tensor is elliptic at the metric $g$ if its differential at $g$ denoted by $L:=d_g Ric$ is elliptic. Note that since {metrics on $M$} are an open set of the vector space of symmetric two-tensors, we have
$$
L: \{\text{symmetric two tensors}\} \to \{\text{symmetric two tensors}\}
$$
and $L$ is a linear differential operator of order two. Recall that $L$ is by definition elliptic if for every $\xi \in T^*_x M$ its principal symbol
$$
p(\xi,x): \{\text{symmetric bilinear forms on } x \} \to \{\text{symmetric bilinear forms on } x \}
$$ 
is an isomorphism for $\xi \ne 0$. In coordinates the principal symbol is obtained just by taking the part that involves two derivatives, and in that part changing every $\nabla_i$ you find in for $\xi_i$, the $i-th$ coordinates of $\xi$. It turns out that $p(\xi,x)$ does not depend or coordinates regarded as a endomorphism between vector spaces. Indeed, let $z$ be a symmetric bilinear form on $T_x M$ and let $u$ be a symmetric two tensor on $M$ such that $u(x)=z$. Let $\phi$ be a smooth function on $M$ with $\phi(x)=0$ and $d_x \phi =\xi$. Then $p(x,\xi)z = L(\phi ^2 u)|_x$. This invariant definition is on Besse's Einstein Manifolds. So the principal symbol regarded as a endomorphism between vector spaces does not depend on coordinates, so being elliptic should not depend on coordinates either. But the books, for example Besse's Einstein Manifolds, says that the ricci tensor is elliptic in harmonic coordinates, and it is not elliptic in any coordinates. I must say that is never explicitly said that the ricci operator is not elliptic in any coordinates, but I deduce that because the elliptic regularity results are not true in any coordinates. The question is ¿how is it possible that being elliptic depens on coordinates?

855287,Algebraic varieties that are isomorphic after a base change,"Let $k$ be a field, $\overline{k}$ its algebraic closure. Suppose $X$ is an algebraic variety over $\overline{k}$. This means that $X$ is a scheme with a finite covering by open affine varieties over $\overline{k}$. The definition i'm using for an affine variety is that it is isomorphic to $SpecA$ for $A$ finitely generated over $\overline{k}$. I am trying to prove that there exists a finite extension $k'$ of $k$, and an algebraic variety $Y$ over $k'$ such that the base change $Y_{\overline{k}}$ is isomorphic to $X$.
I have managed to prove this for the case that $X$ is affine, since then $X \cong Spec(\overline{k}[x_1, ..., x_n]/I)$ for some finitely generated ideal $I$. If $I$ is generated by $f_1, ..., f_r$, we can simply add their coefficients to $k$ to get $k'$, and define $Y := Spec(k'[x_1, ...,x_n]/I')$, with $I'$ generated by $f_1, ..., f_r$ over $k'$. I am having some trouble passing to the general case $X = X_1 \cup ... \cup X_l$ a finite union of affine varieties. For simplicity I am trying to prove first for $X = X_1 \cup X_2$, and suppose $X_1 = Spec(\overline{k}[x_1, ..., x_n]/I_1), X_2 = Spec(\overline{k}[y_1, ..., y_m]/I_2)$. What i've done so far:
Denote $X_1 \cap X_2$ by $D(J_1)$ when viewed as an open subvariety of $X_1$, and $D(J_2)$ when viewed as an open subvariety of $X_2$. I know that the intersection of open affine varieties is affine, hence $D(J_1), D(J_2)$ are affine. It is then possible to define $k'$ by adding to $k$ all the coefficients of the generators of $I_1, I_2, J_1, J_2$, and as above define $Y_1, Y_2$, and even $D(J'_1) \subset Y_1$, $D(J'_2) \subset Y_2$ with $D(J'_1)_{\overline{k}} = D(J_1) \cong D(J_2) = D(J'_2)_{\overline{k}}$.
However, in order to glue $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ together, I need to prove that $D(J'_1) \cong D(J'_2)$, and this is where I am rather stuck. I am not even sure how to construct an ""induced"" morphism between them. So my question is - How to construct $Y$? Am I in the right direction? Is there another appealing way to tackle this?

we have: $$\int\log\left(1+\frac{(s\log(1+x))^{2}}{4\pi^{2}} \right ) dx=(1+x)\log\left(1+\frac{(s\log(1+x))^{2}}{4\pi^{2}} \right ) $$ $$-e^{2\pi i /s}\text{Ei}\left(\log(1+x)-\frac{2\pi i }{s} \right )-e^{-2\pi i /s}\text{Ei}\left(\log(1+x)+\frac{2\pi i }{s} \right )$$ Where $\text{Ei}\left(\cdot\right)$ is the exponential integral function.

Using the asymptotic estimate of the exponential integral function, the limit reduces to: $$\lim _{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left[\log\left(1+\frac{(s\log N)^{2}}{4\pi^{2}} \right )-\log\left(1+\frac{(s\log n)^{2}}{4\pi^{2}} \right )\right]-N\left(\frac{2\log N}{(\log N)^{2}+\frac{4\pi^{2}}{s^{2}}} \right )$$ Or : $$2\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \left[\int_{\log n}^{\log N}\frac{x}{x^{2}+\frac{4\pi^{2}}{s^{2}}}dx-\left(\frac{\log N}{(\log N)^{2}+\frac{4\pi^{2}}{s^{2}}} \right ) \right ]$$","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'euler-maclaurin', 'complex-analysis', 'limits']"

Prove that $G=\{g*x \mid x \in G\}$ My proof : Let $(G,*)$ be a group and $g$ be a fixed element of $G$. Let $x=g^{-1}*y$, where $y$ is an arbitrary element of $G$. Now we can write $g*x=g*(g^{-1}*y)=(g*g^{-1})*y$ by the associative property of groups. But $(g*g^{-1})*y=e*y=y$, where $e$ is the identity element in $G$.

856137,Finding the amount of numbers less than another number which are multiples of a set,"An Example To Illustrate Find the amount of numbers less than 30 that are multiples of the set of numbers [2,3,5] Clearly we can find the number of multiples of a number less than another number through this equation: $$ numberOfMultiplesLessThan =\Big\lceil\frac {numberToFindMultiplessLessThan}{numberToFindMultiplesOf}\Big\rceil - 1 $$ So in this case we have: Number of Multiples of 2: $\frac {30} 2 - 1 = 15 -1 = 14$ Number of Multiples of 3: $\frac {30} 3 - 1 = 10 -1 = 9$ Number of Multiples of 5: $\frac {30} 5 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$ But now we have to check for cases in which a number is a multiple of more than one of these numbers: Number of Multiples of 2 & 3: $\frac {30} {2*3} - 1 = 30/6 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$ Number of Multiples of 2 & 5: $\frac {30} {2*5} - 1 = 30/10 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 $ Number of Multiples of 3 & 5: $\frac {30} {3*5} - 1 = 30/15 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 2 $ Luckily,since $2*3*5 = 30$ there is no number less than thirty that is a multiple of all three, so we don't have to check that set. Unfortunately, for larger sets (and depending on the number that is chosen to be less than) there may be many set intersections to check for. Anyway, we can now find the amount of numbers that are less than 30 and are multiples of either 2, 3, or 5: $\text{Multiples Less than 30} = \text{Number of Multiples of 2} + \text{Number of Multiples of 3} + \text{Number of Multiples of 5} - \text{Number of Multiples of 2 & 3} - \text{Number of Multiples of 2 & 5} - \text{Number of Multiples of 3 & 5}$ $\text{Multiples Less than 30} = 14 + 9 + 5 - 4 - 2 - 2 = 21$ Notes about the Problem Though in this case I choose a number (30) which made the results for the multiple equation turn out nicely, in truth the actual chosen number won't be so nice. So, in those cases the ceiling function must be invoked. It is not a coincidence that the numbers in the set are all prime. My specific application is a bit odd in that it will only select prime numbers and that too, by choosing a prime number it must include all the prime numbers below it (ex: [11,7,5,3,2] is a valid set but [11,5,3,2] is not). I'm not sure how this note will affect the answer, but I thought I'd include it. My Problem This algorithm, while relatively simple, becomes a bit tedious with extremely large numbers and extremely large sets. Examining the problem again, I found that there is a huge amount of simplification that can be made with the overall equation. For example: Consider (again) the case of finding the amount of numbers less than 30 that are Multiples of 2, 3, or 5. The overall equation is this: $ \text{Multiples Less than 30} = \text{Number of Multiples of 2} + \text{Number of Multiples of 3} + \text{Number of Multiples of 5} - \text{Number of Multiples of 2 & 3} - \text{Number of Multiples of 2 & 5} - \text{Number of Multiples of 3 & 5} $ $\text{Multiples Less Than 30} =  29 - (\frac {30} 2 -1) - (\frac {30} 3 - 1) - (\frac {30} 5 - 1) + (\frac {30}{2*3} - 1) + (\frac{30} {2*5} -1) + (\frac{30} {3*5} - 1) $ $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - (\frac {30} 2) - (3\frac {30} 3) - (\frac {30} 5) + (\frac {30}{2*3}) + (\frac{30} {2*5}) + (\frac{30} {3*5}) + 3 - 3 $$ [Note: It is common but not required that the -1's cancel out] $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - (\frac {30} 2) - (\frac {30} 3) - (\frac {30} 5) + (\frac {30}{2*3}) + (\frac{30} {2*5}) + (\frac{30} {3*5}) $$ $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - 30*(\frac12 + \frac 13 + \frac 15 - \frac 1 {2*3} - \frac 1 {2*5} - \frac 1 {(3*5)} )$$ $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - 2*3*5*(\frac12 + \frac 13 + \frac 15 - \frac 1 {2*3} - \frac 1 {2*5} - \frac 1 {(3*5)} )$$ $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - (3*5 + 2*5 + 2*3 - 5 - 3 - 2 )$$ [Note: In cases that don't involve the primorial ( 3*2 or  5*3*2 or  7*5*3*2 or 11*7*5*3*2), you'd have to multiple both sides by the primorial to be able to clear those fractions] $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - (3*5 + 2*5 + 2*3 - 5 - 3 - 2 )$$ $$Multiples Less Than 30 = 29 - (3*4 + 5 + 2*2) $$ [Note: As you can see (Step 9) the relatively long equation turned into something simple. I've done this with a few numbers, and without doing any calculations -- other than factoring and combining like terms -- it always comes down to something relatively simple.] The Actual Question! So, my question is: Using the type of simplification shown above (or any other system for that matter), is there any generalized way to find how many multiples of a prime set as discussed above are below a number that is simpler or faster than the algorithm I described?

The category $\mathbf{Met}$ is, what Wikipedia defines as the category of metric spaces. However, many Analysis books require metric spaces to be non-empty. My question is, which of the above two categories is more well-behaved, and which definition should therefore be preferred from a categorical point of view. For example, $\mathbf{Met}_{\not=\emptyset}$ has no initial object, whereas $\mathbf{Met}$ does, namely the empty space which uniquely embeds into every other metric space. Are there other differences concerning existence of limits and colimits? Are arrows in $\mathbf{Met}_{\not=\emptyset}$ (split/effective/descent/regular/extremal) monomorphisms and epimorphisms iff their images under the embedding functor to $\mathbf{Met}$ are, or do the characterizations change?

856524,Divergence of a vector field on a sequence of spheres,"I'm studying for my exams and I found this problem in the book ""Advanced Calculus"", written by Friedman: ""Consider a sequence of spheres $S_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with center $P_n$ and radius $r_n$, such that $P_n \to P, r_n \to 0$ as $ n \to \infty.$ Let $\textbf{F}$ be a continuously differentiable vector field in a neighborhood of $P$. Prove that $$(\nabla \cdot \textbf{F})(P)=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{V_n}\iint\limits_{S_n}\textbf{F}\cdot \textbf{n}\ dS,$$ where $V_n$ is the volume of the ball with boundary $S_n$."" This is what I did: Observe that, by the Divergence Theorem, $$\frac{1}{V_n}\iint\limits_{S_n}\textbf{F}\cdot \textbf{n}\ dS = \frac{1}{V_n}\iiint\limits_{D_n}\nabla\cdot\textbf{F} \ dV,$$ where $D_n$ is the region bounded by $S_n$. Now, notice that $\dfrac{1}{V_n}\displaystyle \iiint\limits_{D_n}\nabla\cdot\textbf{F} \ dV$ is the mean value of $\nabla \cdot \textbf{F}$ on $D_n$. Since F is continuously differentiable, we have that $\nabla \cdot \textbf{F}$ is continuous, so, for each $n$, there is a point $P_n$ such that $$\frac{1}{V_n} \iiint\limits_{D_n}\nabla\cdot\textbf{F} \ dV = (\nabla \cdot \textbf{F})(P_n)$$ So, $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{V_n}\iint\limits_{S_n}\textbf{F}\cdot \textbf{n} \ dS = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{V_n}\iiint\limits_{D_n}\nabla\cdot\textbf{F} \ dV \\ =\lim_{n \to \infty}(\nabla \cdot \textbf{F})(P_n) = (\nabla \cdot \textbf{F})(P),$$ as we wanted. I have two problems here: 1) I don't know how to prove that because $\nabla \cdot \textbf{F}$ is continuous, we certainly have that there is a point $P_n$ such that $\frac{1}{V_n} \iiint\limits_{D_n}\nabla\cdot\textbf{F} \ dV = (\nabla \cdot \textbf{F})(P_n)$. I know it's true because I saw it in some calculus books, but I haven't found a proof. 2) After I finished, I realize that my points $P_n$ doesn't necessarily have to be the points $P_n$ center of $S_n$. So, because I know that the radius $r_n$ of $S_n$ goes to 0, can I assume that $P$ will be the limit of every sequence $(a_n)$ such that $a_k \in S_k$ $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$?

856526,Computation of the Frenet-Serret trihedron in $\Bbb L^3$ (Lorentz-Minkowski space),"Consider $\Bbb L^3 = (\Bbb R^3, \langle , \rangle)$, with the convention $$\langle (x_1,y_1,z_1), (x_2,y_2,z_2)\rangle = x_1x_2+y_1y_2 - z_1z_2$$
and $\| v \| = \sqrt{|\langle v, v \rangle|}$. Let $\alpha: I \subset \Bbb R\rightarrow \Bbb L^3$ be a spacelike curve, parametrized by arc-length, and $\mathbf{T}(s) := \alpha '(s)$ be the tangent vector to $\alpha$ at $s$. Suppose $\mathbf{T}'(s)$ is lightlike for all $s$. Then we define the normal vector $\mathbf{N}(s) := \mathbf{T}'(s)$, and the binormal vector $\mathbf{B}(s)$ as the unique lightlike vector orthogonal to $\mathbf{T}(s)$ such that $\langle \mathbf{N}(s), \mathbf{B}(s) \rangle = 1$. We do not define the curvature in this case. I have no problem accepting these definitions, and I can even prove the Frenet-Serret equations: $$\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T}' \\ \mathbf{N}' \\ \mathbf{B}' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \tau & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & -\tau \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T} \\ \mathbf{N} \\ \mathbf{B} \end{pmatrix}$$
where $\tau$ will be the torsion of the curve. However, I am having some trouble understanding how to compute the binormal vector in practical cases. Surely I could write $\alpha(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))$, and $\mathbf{B}(s) = (b_1(s), b_2(s), b_3(s))$, and try to solve the system $$\left\{\begin{array}{c} b_1(s)~x'(s) + b_2(s)~y'(s) - b_3(s)~z'(s) = 0 \\ b_1(s)~x''(s) + b_2(s)~y''(s) - b_3(s)~z''(s) = 1 \\ (b_1(s))^2 + (b_2(s))^2 - (b_3(s))^2 = 0 \end{array} \right.$$ I think that in general, it's very hard to solve this. Can someone give some insight about this, or make an example? I have the same problem if $\alpha$ is lightlike and pseudo-parametrized by arc-length, but if I can understand this case, I can probably manage the other one by myself. There shouldn't be much difference. Thank you!

856556,The applicability of the Dominated Convergence theorem on the real line,"Let $f_n(x)=\frac{1}{n}\chi_{[0,n]}(x)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\chi$ is the characteristic/indicator function. Now it is clear that $f_n\rightarrow 0$, but in the text I am using it says we can't apply the Dominated Convergence theorem as there is no function to dominate $f_n$ I have trouble seeing that. To me the $f_n$'s are dominated by the constant function $1$. So I think can apply the Dominated Convergence theorem in some cases which depends on the choice measure  where the constant functions are integrable. So if we are using the Lebesgue measure (on $\mathbb{R}$) then we can't use the Dominated Convergence theorem (and the text is right), but if are using a finite measure then will it be valid to use the Dominated Convergence theorem and we will then have $\lim\limits_n\int f_n\rightarrow0$. Also if our space was just a bounded interval and we have  the Lebesgue measure (since it is now a finite measure on the internal), then   will it be fine to use the Dominated Convergence theorem on the $f_n$'s ? Is this right or wrong?","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

In other words $\det(W+Re(W))-\det(W-Re(W))\equiv 0 \mod 4$. Any comment really appreciated. Note (Grumpy Parsnip): A generalized phenomenon seems to be true here. One can define $n\times n$ matrices of a similar form. E.g. $A_2=\left(\begin{array}{cc} x_1&x_2\\0&1\end{array}\right)$ and $B_2=\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1&0\\x_3&x_4\end{array}\right)$.

I'll award a bounty for a solution to the $2\times 2$ case. (Hopefully the OP, who is a friend of mine, will not mind my edits.)","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
