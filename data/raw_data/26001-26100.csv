237691,Baby Rudin Chapter 3 Exercise 11(d),"I'm writing solutions to exercises in Baby Rudin I think might want to assign students, and I'm having particular difficulty with 11(d) in Chapter 3. Namely, for a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of positive reals such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}$ diverges, does $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{1+na_{n}}$ converge or diverge? I know that if we take $a_{n} := \frac{1}{n}$, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{1+na_{n}} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n}$ diverges. But I can't seem to come up with an example such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{1+na_{n}}$ converges while $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}$ diverges. I did a bit of searching online, but the example I came across was $a_{n} = \frac{1}{n(\log n)^{p}}$, where $p > 1$. However, this isn't satisfactory since $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(\log n)^{p}}$ converges by Theorem 3.29 in Baby Rudin. Can anyone help me out?",['sequences-and-series']
237713,Partial derivative of a summation.,"I am trying to confirm a stated result on my lecture slide. Question : Given that $A:= \sum_i^n \frac{a_i}{(1+b)^{t_i}}$, where $a_i,b \in \mathbb{R}_+$ and $t_i \in \{t_1,...,t_n\}$ where $0 < t_1 < ... < t_n < \infty$. Demonstrate that: $-\frac1A \frac{\partial A}{\partial b} = - \sum_i^n t_i \frac{a_i}{(1+b)^{-t_i}}$ Current progress : $\frac{\partial A}{\partial b} = - \sum_i^n t_i \frac{a_i}{(1+b)^{t_i + 1}}$ PROBLEM Just from this first step (which could be incorrect), it seems that I can't arrive at what the lecture slide claims.

237790,What is degree of freedom in statistics?,"In statistics, degree of  freedom is widely used in regression analysis, ANOVA and so on. But, what is degree of  freedom ? Wikipedia said that The number of degrees of freedom is the number of values in the final  calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. Mathematically, degrees of freedom is the number of dimension of the  domain of a random vector, or essentially the number of 'free' 
  components: how many components need to be known before the vector is
  fully determined. However, it is still hard for me to understand the concept intuitively . Question: Could anyone provide a intuitive explain to the concept and anything can help me understand?

237863,Monoids with positive and negative elements,"By a pointed monoid I mean a monoid $M$ together with an absorbing element $0 \in M$ (i.e. $0x=x0=0$). Equivalently, this is a monoid in the monoidal category $(\mathsf{Set}_*,\wedge)$.

You can imagine $M^+$ as the set of elements $\geq 0$ and $M^-$ as the set of elements $\leq 0$, even though $M$ doesn't have to be ordered in the usual sense. As a class of examples, take the multiplicative structure of an ordered (semi)ring, for example $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$. These have the $\pm$-submonoids $\{0,1\},\{0,-1\},\{0,1,-1\}$. The ""generic"" example in terms of representation theory is the following: Take any monoid $G$ and consider $E = E^+ \vee_{0} E^-$, where $EM^+$ is the set of endomorphisms of $G$ and $E^-$ is the set of anti-endomorphisms of $G$. Let $0$ be the trivial endomorphism, and $1$ be the identity. The multiplication in $M$ is the composition of functions. Then $E$ is a $\pm$-monoid, which may be called $\mathrm{End}^{\pm}(G)$. A module over a $\pm$-monoid $M$ is a monoid $G$ together with a morphism $M \to \mathrm{End}^{\pm}(G)$ of $\pm$-monoids. Question. Have these $\pm$-monoids and their modules already been studied in the literature? Or do they have another common name?

In the second chapter, we are asked to prove the following: $G$ is a finite group with a unique element $f$ of order $2$. Then $\operatorname{\Pi_{g\in G}}g=f$. This result is highly plausible. If we multiply the elements in the order of \begin{equation}e\cdot f\cdot \text{elements of order 3}\cdot\text{elements of order 4}\cdots,\end{equation} and pair elements with their inverses, then we get $f$, since it is the only element that does not have a couple.

Then we must have $n_{k-1}=n_k$. The only proof I could find was here . But I have some difficulties understanding it. It is very short and it goes like this: Without loss of generality we assume that $0\leq a_s<n_s$ for all $s\in[1,k]$. For $|z|<1$ we have
  $$\sum_{s=1}^k\frac{z^{a_s}}{1-z^{n_s}}=\sum_{s=1}^k\sum_{q=0}^\infty z^{a_s+qn_s}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n=\frac{1}{1-z}.$$

For the coercivity condition, how do I deal with the last term in $a$, which has a minus sign? Also I don't know how to deal with the matrix terms in that last term.

238043,Lines on a cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ using Chern classes,"I'm trying to figure out why there are 27 lines on a smooth cubic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ using Chern classes, without looking up the proof in 3264 and All That . One thing confusing me is the following: We want to find the top Chern class of the bundle $E$ over $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ whose fiber over a line $L$ is the space of cubic forms on $\mathbb{P}^3$, restricted to $L$. After all, a smooth cubic hypersurface gives a section of this vector bundle, and the top Chern class will hopefully tell us that this section needs to vanish 27 times. The first way I thought of to study $E$ is to note that it is a quotient of the trivial bundle $\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20}\to\mathbb{G}(1,3),$ where $\mathbb{C}^{20}$ parametrizes cubic forms on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and the map $$\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20}\to E$$ of bundles maps $(L,f)\mapsto(L,f|_L)\in E.$ Then these fit in the short exact sequence $$0\to F\to\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20}\to E\to0,$$ where $F$ is the bundle whose fiber over $L$ is the cubic forms of $\mathbb{P}^3$ that vanish on $L$. Now the part I'm getting confused about. Properties of Chern classes tell us that the total Chern classes satisfy $$c(\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20})=c(E)c(F).$$ Since $\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20}$ is a trivial bundle, I'm pretty sure it has trivial total Chern class $c(\mathbb{G}(1,3)\times\mathbb{C}^{20})=1.$ But this would mean that $c(E)$ and $c(F)$ are units, i.e. trivial themselves, right?

238060,"When are sums and integrals ""identical"" in form?","In the answer to this question Eric Näslund showed that logarithms can be written as the following limit of a sum: $$\displaystyle \log(x) = \lim_{k\to \infty } \, \sum\limits_{n=k}^{x k} \frac{1}{n}$$ Changing the symbol for the sum $\sum$ into an integral $\int$ with the same limits as in the sum, one still gets logarithms: $$\displaystyle \log(x) = \lim_{k\to \infty } \, \int\limits_k^{x k} \frac{1}{n} \, dn$$ or at least in Mathematica, so I guess it is true. Are there other sums and integrals such that the function to be integrated or summed is the same, as well as the integration and summation limits, that give the same result? This provided that integrals or sums giving zero as result are not considered. As a Mathematica program this is: Clear[n, k, x];
Table[Limit[Integrate[1/n, {n, k, x*k}], k -> Infinity], {x, 1, 12}]
Table[Limit[Sum[1/n, {n, k, x*k}], k -> Infinity], {x, 1, 12}] which gives the output: {0, Log[2], Log[3], Log[4], Log[5], Log[6], Log[7], Log[8], Log[9], Log[10], Log[11], Log[12]} in both cases.

238076,Time required to reach the goal when an object will be slowing down incrementally based on distance travelled?,"I was thinking about this when flying on the plane which was approaching and slowing down. Assume an object is approaching its target which is at a certain initial distance d at time t0. It starts at a speed that will allow it to reach the target in exactly one hour (e.g. d=100km, it starts at 100 km/h). Incrementally, it will slow down so that at every point in time, it will be exactly one hour far from reaching the target (after it had travelled 40 km being 60 km away, it will be travelling at 60 km/h). After reaching a predefined minimum speed (10 km/h), it will keep its velocity constant (and it will need exactly one additional hour to reach the target). How long will it take to reach the target? I somehow assume the answer should be 2 hours, independently of initial distance, but it does not fit (because then it would not matter what the original distance is (which it should not since we are travelling faster in the beginning), but any shorter path is included in the longer path and the resulting equation cannot possibly be true (or can it be?))

238416,Integrating angular velocity to obtain orientation,"Suppose that $\gamma:[0,1]\to \operatorname{SO}(3)$ is a path in the space of orientation preserving rotations of $\mathbb R^3$.  It is classical that we can find a corresponding $\omega:[0,1]\to \mathbb R^3$, the angular velocity, such that if $r(t)=\gamma(t)r(0)$, then $r'(t)=\omega(t)\times r(t)$ (where $\times$ is the cross product).  Phrased differently, $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\gamma(t)\right)\gamma^{-1}(t)$ is skew-symmetric with respect to an orthonormal basis.  The correspondence between these two statements comes from the formula $$\omega\times v =\pmatrix{0 & -\omega_3 & \omega_2 \\ \omega_3 & 0 & -\omega_1 \\ -\omega_2 & \omega_1 & 0  }v.$$ It is worth pointing out that this formula underlies an isomorphism of Lie algebras $(\mathbb R^3,\times)\cong \mathfrak{so}_3$, given by $x\mapsto ad_x$ Assuming whatever niceness we need (likely just continuity), given $\omega(t)$, there is a unique solution to the differential equation
$$\gamma'(t)=\omega(t)\gamma(t);\quad \gamma(0)=I.$$ My question: Is there any nice expression for $\gamma$ in terms of $\omega$, the way there is when solving first order linear differential equations? What I have tried so far: This is a first order linear system of differential equations, and so there should be some well established theory regarding the solution of such systems.  However, I have only seen the constant coefficient case before, and my initial attempts to generalize the solution have met with some resistance.  In particular, the formula $\frac{d}{dt}e^{A(t)}=A'(t)e^{A(t)}$ doesn't hold for matrices unless $[A(t),A'(t)]=0$, being replaced by the more complicated formula $\frac{d}{dt}e^{A(t)}=e^{\operatorname{Ad}_{A(t)}}(A'(t))e^{A(t)}$.  As such, a solution of the form $e^{A(t)}$ would have to satisfy $$\omega(t)=e^{\operatorname{Ad}_{A(t)}}(A'(t)).$$ The problem can be simplified somewhat since $A(t)$ must be skew-symmetric.  By using the realization of the bracket as coming from the cross product and combining that with properties of the cross product, $e^{\operatorname{Ad}_X}Y$ can be rewritten in more explicit, if not simpler, terms.  However, it does not seem to make the problem any more solvable.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'lie-groups']"

238521,Is $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{(n!)^\frac{1}{n}} = e$ any easier than Stirling? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 11 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Showing that $\frac{\sqrt[n]{n!}}{n}$ $\rightarrow \frac{1}{e}$ Stirling's approximation says that
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^n \sqrt{n}}{n!  e^n }  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}.$$
Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} x^\frac{1}{n} \to 1$ uniformly on a neighbourhood of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi}}$, it follows that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{n^n \sqrt{n}}{n!  e^n } \right)^\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{(n!)^\frac{1}{n}} \cdot \frac{n^\frac{1}{2n}}{e} = 1.$$
Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^\frac{1}{2n} = 1$, we get the limit in the title
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{(n!)^\frac{1}{n}} = e.$$ Question : Is Stirling's approximation is really needed to derive the above limit? Or is there an easier way to reach the same conclusion? Motivation: The radius of convergence $R$ of a power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$  is given by Hadamard's formula
$$\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^\frac{1}{n}.$$
If we know ahead of time that $R > 0$ then the coefficients are given by 
$$ a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}$$
where $f$ is the function defined by the power series. Then we get
$$\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^\frac{1}{n} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{|f^{(n)}(0)|^\frac{1}{n}}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{(n!)^\frac{1}{n}} = e \cdot \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{|f^{(n)}(0)|^\frac{1}{n}}{n}.$$

Then for every $\varphi \in T$, $T \models \varphi$ and by completeness, $T \vdash \varphi$. That is, there is a finite sequence of $\varphi_i$, $i = 1, \dots n$, with $\varphi = \varphi_n$. (Unfortunately, these $\varphi_i$ are not necessarily all in $T$.) Since $T$ doesn't have a model, we also have $T \models \lnot \varphi$ and hence there are $\bar{\varphi}_i$, $i= 1, \dots m$ with $\bar{\varphi}_m = \lnot \varphi$, again, unfortunately these don't have to be in $T$. My proof then ended as follows: Then $\{\varphi, \lnot \varphi\}$ is a finite subset of $T$ that doesn't have a model. Unfortunately, I can't assume that $\{\varphi, \lnot \varphi\}$ is a subset of $T$.

238594,pseudo-inverse to the operation of turning a metric space into a topological space,"The construction of turning a metric space $(X,d)$ into a topological space by inducing the topology generated by the open balls gives rise to a functor $Met\to Top$ for any reasonable category $Met$ of metric spaces. Of course not every topological space is metrizable and thus there can't possibly be an inverse functor. My question is whether one can enlarge the category $Met$ to some category $M$ in a sensible way and so that there is an embedding $Met\to M$ together with a functor $M\to Top$ which extends the open balls topology construction $Met\to Top$, such that $M\to Top$ has some sort of pseudo-inverse functor $Top\to M$. In particular, is it possible for $Met \to Top$ to have a (left or right) adjoint with nice properties (e.g., being a (co)reflection). The context for the question is curiosity as to the following situation. The problem of classical metrizability is very well studied. There are some variants on what one means by metrizability (i.e., do we demand the metric to be symmetric or not, separated or not, etc.) that can slightly enlarge the class of metrizable spaces but still far from allows a pseudo-inverse. Other possibilities for enlarging $Met$ is to consider probabilistic metric spaces. The category of probabilistic metric spaces is a very natural category to consider and ordinary metric spaces embed in it. It seems that the problem of when a topological space is probabilistically metrizable is not so well-studied, and I wonder why. I also wonder then if one can further weaken the notion of metrizability to finally come up with a single category as in my question above.","['general-topology', 'category-theory', 'metric-spaces']"

The rules are as follows. we start with 1000 coins we always bet that heads come up minimum bet is 10 coins maximum bet is 80 coins if tails comes up, we lose our bet if heads comes up, we win twice as much as we bet the coin is fair and so the probability of heads is 50% we start with a bet of 10 if we lose we double our bet if we lose the maximum bet of 80 we start at a bet of 10 again if we win we start at a bet of 10 again So in this set up, 50% of the time we would get our 10 coins back plus 10 additional coins. When we lose we need to lose four times in a row which I've figured out will be 6.25% which will cost 150 coins. 50% (10 coins) * 50% (20 coins) * 50% (40 coins) * (80 coins) 50% = 6.25% (150 coins total) Would I be right in thinking that this means that the chance of breaking even is 43.75%?

Total: 1000 start + 500 win - 937.5 loss = 562.5 end balance I am not confident that my maths is correct. I'd appreciate it if someone eyed it over and told me if I'm going horribly wrong.",['probability']
