4080429,"Prob. 21, Chap. 2, in Royden's REAL ANALYSIS: The union of two measurable sets is measurable","Here is Prob. 21, Chap. 2, in the book Real Analysis by H.L. Royden and P.M. Fitzpatrick, 4th edition: Use property (ii) of Theorem 11 as the primitive definition of a measurable set and prove that the union of two measurable sets is measurable. Then do the same for property (iv). Here is Theorem 11: Let $E$ be any set of real numbers. Then each of the following four assertions is equivalent to the measurability of $E$ . (i) For each $\epsilon > 0$ , there is an open set $O$ containing $E$ for which $m^*(O\setminus E) < \epsilon$ . (ii) There is a $G_\delta$ -set $G$ containing $E$ for which $m^*(G \setminus E) = 0$ . (iii) For each $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ for which $m^*(E \setminus F) < \epsilon$ . (iv) There is an $F_\sigma$ -set $F$ contained in $E$ for which $m^*(E \setminus F) = 0$ . My Attempt: Using property (ii) as the primitive definition of a measurable set, let us suppose that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are measurable sets, where $E_1 \subset \mathbb{R}$ and $E_2 \subset \mathbb{R}$ of course. Then there are $G_\delta$ -sets $G_1$ and $G_2$ containing $E_1$ and $E_2$ , respectively, for which $$
m^* \left( G_1 \setminus E_1 \right) = 0 = m^* \left( G_2 \setminus E_2 \right). 
$$ As $E_1 \subset G_1$ and $E_2 \subset G_2$ , so we also have $E_1 \cup E_2 \subset G_1 \cup G_2$ . We show that $G_1 \cup G_2$ is also a $G_\delta$ -set. As $G_1$ and $G_2$ are $G_\delta$ -sets, so there are countable collections $\left\{ U_{1j} \right\}_{j=1}^\infty$ and $\left\{ U_{2k} \right\}_{k=1}^\infty$ of open sets (of $\mathbb{R}$ ) such that $$
G_1 = \bigcap_{j=1}^\infty U_{1j} \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad G_2 = \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty U_{2k}. 
$$ Then we obtain $$
\begin{align}
G_1 \cup G_2 &= \left( \bigcap_{j=1}^\infty U_{1j}  \right) \bigcup \left(  \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty U_{2k} \right) \\
&= \bigcap_{j=1}^\infty  \left[ U_{1j} \bigcup  \left(  \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty U_{2k} \right) \right]  \\
&= \bigcap_{j=1}^\infty  \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty \left(  U_{1j} \bigcup U_{2k} \right),
\end{align}
$$ whcih being the intersection of the  countable collection $\left\{ U_{1j} \cup U_{2k} \right\}_{j, k =1}^\infty$ of open sets is a $G_\delta$ -set. Furthermore, we also find that $$
\begin{align}
\left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \setminus \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) &= \left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \cap  \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right)^C \\
&= \left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \cap  \left( E_1^C \cap E_2^C \right) \\
&= \left[ G_1 \cap \left( E_1^C \cap E_2^C \right) \right] \cup \left[ G_2 \cap \left( E_1^C \cap E_2^C \right) \right] \\
&= \left[ \left(  G_1 \cap E_1^C \right)  \cap E_2^C \right] \cup \left[ G_2 \cap \left( E_2^C \cap E_1^C \right) \right] \\
&= \left[ \left(  G_1 \cap E_1^C \right)  \cap E_2^C \right] \cup \left[ \left(  G_2 \cap E_2^C \right) \cap E_1^C \right] \\
&\subset \left( G_1 \cap E_1^C \right) \cup \left( G_2 \cap E_2^C \right) \\
&= \left( G_1 \setminus E_1 \right) \cup \left( G_2 \setminus E_2 \right).
\end{align} 
$$ Thus we have the inclusion $$
\left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \setminus \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \ \subset \ \left( G_1 \setminus E_1 \right) \cup \left( G_2 \setminus E_2 \right).
$$ Therefore using the monotonocity and sub-additivity of the outer measure, we have $$
\begin{align}
0 &\leq m^* \left( \left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \setminus \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right)  \right) \\ 
&\leq m^* \left( \left( G_1 \setminus E_1 \right) \cup \left( G_2 \setminus E_2 \right) \right) \\
&\leq m^* \left( G_1 \setminus E_1 \right) + m^* \left( G_2 \setminus E_2 \right) \\
&= 0 + 0 \\
&= 0,
\end{align}
$$ which implies that $$
m^* \left( \left( G_1 \cup G_2 \right) \setminus \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right)  \right) = 0.
$$ Thus we have shown that there exists a $G_\delta$ -set $G := G_1 \cup G_2$ for which $$
m^* \left( G \setminus \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \right) = 0. 
$$ Hence $E_1 \cup E_2$ is measurable. Is this proof correct? Now using the property (iv), let us suppose that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are measurable sets. Then there are $F_\sigma$ -sets $F_1$ and $F_2$ contained in $E_1$ and $E_2$ , respectively, for which $$
m^* \left( E_1 \setminus F_1 \right) = 0 = m^* \left( E_2 \setminus F_2 \right). 
$$ As $F_1 \subset E_1$ and $F_2 \subset E_2$ , so $F_1 \cup F_2 \subset E_1 \cup E_2$ . As $F_1$ and $F_2$ are $F_\sigma$ -sets, so there are countable collections $\left\{ V_{1j} \right\}_{j=1}^\infty$ and $\left\{ V_{2k} \right\}_{k=1}^\infty$ of closed sets of $\mathbb{R}$ for which $$
F_1 = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty V_{1j} \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad F_2 = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty V_{2k}. 
$$ Then we obtain $$
F_1 \cup F_2 = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \left( V_{1j} \cup V_{2k} \right), 
$$ and thus $F_1 \cup F_2$ , being the union of the countable collection $\left\{ V_{1j} \cup V_{2k} \right\}_{j, k = 1}^\infty$ of closed sets, is an $F_\sigma$ -set. Furthermore, as before, since $$
\left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \setminus \left( F_1 \cup F_2 \right)\ \subset \  \left( E_1 \setminus F_1 \right) \cup \left( E_2 \setminus F_2 \right), 
$$ therefore we have $$
\begin{align} 
0 &\leq m^* \left( \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \setminus \left( F_1 \cup F_2 \right)  \right) \\ 
&\leq m^* \left( \left( E_1 \setminus F_1 \right) \cup \left( E_2 \setminus F_2 \right) \right) \\ 
&\leq m^*  \left( E_1 \setminus F_1  \right) + m^* \left( E_2 \setminus F_2 \right) \\
&= 0 + 0 \\
&= 0,
\end{align}
$$ and so $$
m^* \left( \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \setminus \left( F_1 \cup F_2 \right)  \right) = 0,
$$ Thus we have an $F_\sigma$ set $F := F_1 \cup F_2$ contined in $E_1 \cup E_2$ for which $m^* \left( \left( E_1 \cup E_2 \right) \setminus F \right) = 0$ .
Therefore it follows that set $E_1 \cup E_2$ is measurable. Is this proof correct? Are both of my above proofs correct and clear enough in each and every detail? Or, are there any issues?","['measure-theory', 'solution-verification', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
4080432,Cambridge Admissions Exam: Where is the mistake?,"I am trying to solve the following problem. My work: Note: I am having only issues with (ii) but I have included my work for (i). (i) I got the velocity  components as $$ v_x=v\cos \theta \tag{Horizontal Velocity} $$ $$v_y=v\sin\theta - tg  \tag{Vertical Velocity}$$ We have $$ \tan \phi= \frac{v_y}{v_x}=\tan \theta -\frac{tg}{v \cos \theta}.$$ From the velocity components, we get the displacement components to be $$s_x=vt\cos \theta \tag{Horizontal Displacement}$$ $$s_y=vt\sin \theta - t^2\frac{g}{2} \tag{Vertical Displacement}$$ By definition, $$\tan \alpha = \frac{s_y}{s_x}=\tan \theta - \frac{tg}{2v\cos \theta} \tag{$*$}$$ Equating  the two expressions through $\frac{tg}{v\cos\theta}$ gives $$\tan \theta + \tan \phi = 2\tan \alpha$$ as desired. (ii) Here is where I start to have issues. From $(*)$ we have $$\tan \alpha - \tan \theta = - \pm \frac{tg}{2v} \sqrt{1+\tan^2 \theta}$$ $$\implies 4\tan^2 \alpha + 4\tan^2 \theta-8\tan\theta \tan \alpha= \frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}(1+\tan^2\theta)$$ $$\iff (4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2})\tan^2\theta -8\tan \theta \tan \alpha +4\tan^2 \alpha -\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}=0$$ If $\tan\theta$ and $\tan \theta'$ are the solutions for $\tan \theta$ in this equation, then $$\tan \theta + \tan \theta'= \frac{8\tan \alpha}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}$$ $$ \tan \theta \tan \theta' = \frac{4\tan^2\alpha - \frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}$$ and thus $$\tan(\theta + \theta')=\frac{\tan \theta + \tan \theta'}{1-\tan \theta \tan \theta'}=\frac{\frac{8\tan \alpha}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}}{1-\frac{4\tan^2\alpha - \frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}}= \frac{\frac{8\tan \alpha}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}}{\frac{4-4\tan^2 \alpha}{4-\frac{t^2g^2}{v^2}}}=\tan{2\alpha}$$ which is wrong as we require $\tan(\theta + \theta')=-\cot \alpha$ .

4080618,Describe sheaf properties via equalizers,"Let $X$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf on $X$ , with value in the category $\mathsf{C}$ . To be more specific, $\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from the category $(\mathsf{Open}_X)^{\mathrm{op}}$ to $\mathsf{C}$ , where objects in $(\mathsf{Open}_X)$ are open sets of $X$ and $\mathrm{Hom}_{(\mathsf{Open}_X)}(U,V)$ is a singleton iff $U \subseteq V$ , otherwise the hom set is empty. In this broader context above, I want to describe the sheaf property. I have seen two descriptions: Description 1 : The following equalizer diagram holds for any open set $U \subseteq X$ and its cover $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ : $$F(U) \rightarrow \prod_{i} F(U_i) {{{} \atop \longrightarrow}\atop{\longrightarrow \atop {}}} \prod_{i, j} F(U_i \cap U_j)$$ This is adapted from Wikipedia and the note Section 2.2 . Description 2 : The following equalizer diagram is exact: $$0 \rightarrow F(U) \rightarrow \prod_{i} F(U_i) {{{} \atop \longrightarrow}\atop{\longrightarrow \atop {}}} \prod_{i, j} F(U_i \cap U_j)$$ This is adapted from ""Gortz and Wedhorn's Algbraic Geometry 1 - Schemes"". I have figured out what the two arrows means from the helpful post Definition of sheaf using equalizer . My question 1 : In Description 1 , it seems that this ONLY means that the two paths from $F(U)$ to $\prod_{i, j} F(U_i \cap U_j)$ (via the ""upper arrow"" and the ""lower arrow"") coincide and they both equal to the restriction $F(U) \rightarrow \prod_{i, j} F(U_i \cap U_j)$ directly. ** I cannot see why this is the sheaf property**. My question 2 : In Description 2 , we claimed that the ""diagram of equalizer"" exacts . But I have not found any references to really define what does the exactness mean for such a diagram. My motivation : My original attempt is to understand when a certain presheaf is indeed a sheaf. For example, the kernel of a sheaf morphism is automatically a sheaf while cokernel and image do not. (We still need to do sheafification.) I'm trying to give a reasonable explanation of such phenomenons and it seems that by working from such categorical perspective might help. (So to some extent, I cannot accept the Description 2 since the EXACTNESS of such diagrams are quite vague and I don't know how to play with it categorially.) However, Description 1 (with merely an ""equalizer diagram"") may not be equivalent to the sheaf property (from my naive thought). My question 3 : How to really describe the sheaf property categorially and how such consideration shed light on my motivation? Any references are welcome! Sorry for such a long (and maybe vague) post. Thank you all for commenting and answering.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'category-theory', 'reference-request']"

From this it would then follow by the real version of the spectral theorem that $A$ is symmetric. If it is, is there a way to prove this statement directly, without appealing to the spectral theorem?

4080781,"Best strategy for cheating in the ""cheating royal riddle""","I watched a video awhile ago from Ted-Ed called the ""cheating royal riddle"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9c7sJ08Bg . The riddle is as follows: You're the advisor in a competition where four contestants roll both dice 20 times, in private, and add up the results. The red die has the numbers 2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17 on the six sides, and the blue die has 3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18 . The dice are fair. A contestant should be disqualified by you, the advisor, if you're at least 90% sure that the score they reported wasn't actually their total. The highest-scoring player who wasn't disqualified is the winner. In the video, the contestants A , B , C , and D , reported values 385 , 840 , 700 , and 423 , respectively. B was disqualified for not being possible (too high). C was disqualified or being improbable (would require rolling highest numbers on all 20 rolls), and D was disqualified for not being possible (not a multiple of 5 ). A was the only one left not disqualified, so she won. My Question What would the optimal strategy look like for this game if you were one of the contestants and wanted to cheat and not be detected by the advisor? My first attempt is to honestly play the game mostly, but have a ""cheat"" round every 3 rounds, where I take the lowest number rolled and manually flip it to the highest number on that die. But I cannot figure out how to calculate the odds of that strategy on average. I guess there is perhaps a calculable number that you can just calculate and report, but it would be interesting to also know if there is an optimal strategy to ""play the game out"" and be very likely to score higher than your opponents but not too high as to exceed the advisor's 90% threshold for cheating; that strategy would work even if you were observed by a proctor. I guess if you ""play the game out"", there is always a possibility that you get extremely lucky and are disqualified for cheating even if you didn't, so any strategy to improve your odds will make that situation more likely, so perhaps the best strategy is to just calculate the number and report it to ensure you're right below the threshold of being disqualified. I'm working on a simulator for this just out of curiosity, but I figured I would ask here. I am new to this SE (normally on SO), but ""Solving mathematical puzzles"" showed up on the on-topic help ( https://math.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic ) for this SE, so I hope this is an appropriate place to put this question.","['game-theory', 'statistics', 'puzzle', 'probability']"

Further, we have that $$(\forall z\in\mathbb{D}\setminus\{0\}):|z^m|\left|f^{(m)}(z)\right|\leq M.$$ Thus, the function $g(z):=z^mf^{(m)}(z)$ has a removable singularity at $z=0$ by Riemann's singularity theorem and so it can be extended to a function $h(z)$ that is holomorphic on the entire unit disk.

4080882,Ask George Casella Question 8.12 b,"This is not a too much difficult question, but I think I have problems on concepts or understandings. The problem is a normal population: with mean $\mu$ and known variance $\sigma^2$ . Take $\alpha$ =.05. Then do the LRT that is: $H_0: \mu=0 $ versus $H_1:\mu \neq0$ . The solution is based on example 8.2.2. I can understand this example. In example 8.2.2., the variance is 1. So according to our problem here, I find the LRT statistic is $$\lambda(\textbf{x})=exp[-n\bar{x}^2/(2\sigma^2)]$$ This is similar to (8.2.2), except in our question we don't fix variance to be 1 and our specific value ( $\mu_0$ ) is zero. Then my idea is $\lambda(\textbf{x})\leq c$ , so we have $|\bar{x}|\geq \sqrt{\frac{-2\sigma^2 logc}{n}}$ Now I got my first problem. The solution said For α = .05 take c = 1.96. But I don't know what value c I should plug in. It reminds me when I do differential equations. We see a lot of constants, and each step we have a new c. For example, I can name c above as c. I can also name $logc$ as c. I think I can even name the whole term above as c, since n is fixed and we know $\sigma^2$ . When the solution said c = 1.96, I don't know what part is 1.96. Then I want to get power function. I know power function is $P(|\bar{x}|\geq \sqrt{\frac{-2\sigma^2 logc}{n}})$ . I know $\bar{x}$ has $norm(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ . So $$P(|\bar{x}|\geq \sqrt{\frac{-2\sigma^2 logc}{n}}) =2*P(\bar{x} \geq \sqrt{\frac{-2\sigma^2 logc}{n}})=P(Z\geq \sqrt{-2logc}-\frac{\mu \sqrt{n}}{\sigma})$$ I don't know the above is correct and how to do next.

4080888,Iterated polynomials modulo $p$ and divisibility properties,"Looking around Math.SE, I found this interesting question about the compositeness of the product of a list of numbers (specifically primes) plus one. As the questioner points out there, this recursive application (starting after the first application) can also be represented by the polynomial $x(x-1)+1 = x^2-x+1$ . Furthermore, a user comments that for inputs not congruent to $0,1 \mod 7$ , this will always result in a composite number in a finite number of steps. One can easily see that $0$ and $1$ $\mod p$ for any prime $p$ will always be an exception. An intuitive way to represent this mathematically is a graph structure that maps an input residue to its output residue and checking if there is a path from the input to zero (signalling compositeness for a certain residue class after exactly [path length] iterations). Let's call these residues ""good"". Let's also call residue systems for that every input ends up at zero ""good systems"". Naturally, the first question to ask after looking at the comments is: Can we do ""better""?. Consulting Mathematica ${}^*$ and looking at residue systems that maximize the relative amount of starting residues that eventually end up at zero, there is only one example within reasonable search space that hardly does any better ( $\mod 139$ with $100$ good residues). I have gone beyond probably $p > 1400$ without having found a ""better"" prime $p$ with a ratio bigger than $\frac{100}{139}$ and my calculations regularly time out, which is why I am turning to this community in hopes of clever optimizations and bigger crunching power: Is there a reasonably sized residue system for $x^2-x+1$ that has a larger amount of ""good"" residues relative to its size than $139$ with $\frac{100}{139}$ ?

4080986,Infinitely Many Prime Divisors $k\pmod n$,"Fix $f(x)\in\mathbb Z[x]$ a polynomial. For a given prime $p,$ we say $p$ is a ""prime divisor"" of $f$ if and only if $p$ divides $f(k)$ for some $k\in\mathbb Z.$ It is known that nonconstant $f$ have infinitely many prime divisors , and one can even exhibit polynomials $f$ with fun properties; for example $$p\;\;\text{divides}\;\;\Phi_n(nx)\implies p\equiv1\pmod n,$$ where $\Phi_n(x)\in\mathbb Z[x]$ is the $n$ th cyclotomic polynomial. One can even show, using this, that every nonconstant polynomial $f$ have infinitely many $1\pmod n$ prime divisors. (See discussion after Theorem 3 here .) Explicitly, we can use Dedekind-Kummer to take all but finitely many of the primes which split completely in the closure of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_n)$ and $\mathbb Q(\alpha)$ where $\alpha\in\mathbb C$ is a root of $f.$ Showing the general case, however, looks harder. The question is as follows. For nonconstant polynomials $f(x)\in\mathbb Z[x],$ are there infinitely many $k\pmod n$ prime divisors, for any $n,k\in\mathbb N$ with $\gcd(k,n)=1$ ? In particular, I suspect that purely ""algebraic"" techniques (even allowing, say, Dedekind-Kummer) are insufficient here, but I have no strong reason to believe this. Actually, the question is false for somewhat easy reasons, as was pointed out to me: the polynomial $\Phi_n(nx)$ itself fails to hit every single $\pmod n$ class except for $1\pmod n$ and so provides a counterexample. The revised question, then, is for a classification of which modular classes of primes are hit infinitely often.

I' ve been trying to show that $R/I$ serves as an example of a simple ring which is not semisimple. I have shown that $R/I$ it is not left Artinian and not left Notherian which shows that $R/I$ cannot be semisimple. Although, I am having some trouble to show that $R/I$ is simple. So far I have proved that if $f\in R\setminus I$ then there exists $x,y\in R$ such that $xfy=I_V$ , where $I_V$ is the identity map on $V$ . Now I tried to show that $I$ must be a maximal ideal by using the above fact. So I wrote, if $I\subsetneq J$ is a left ideal of $R$ and $f\in J\setminus I$ then there exists $x,y\in R$ such that $xfy=I_V$ . Now, $J$ being a left ideal implies that $xf\in J$ . I want to somehow prove that $I_V=(xf)y\in J$ to conclude that $J$ must be equal to $R$ but I dont know that $(xf)y\in J$ since $J$ is not necessarily a right ideal. Am I missing something? Do you have any ideas? Thanks in advance! Edited Answer: From the comments below, $R/I$ is simple if and only if $R/I$ does not contain any non trivial two sided ideals. Therefore, to show that $R/I$ is simple we need to prove that for a two sided ideal $0\neq \overline{J}\subseteq R/I$ we have $\overline{J}=R/I$ . We know that there exists a two sided ideal $I\subsetneq J\subseteq R$ such that $J/I = \overline{J}$ . For $f\in J\setminus I$ there exists $x,y\in R$ with $xfy = I_V$ . $J$ being a two sided ideal implies that $I_V\in J$ . But then $J=R$ and therefore $\overline{J}=R/I$ and $R/I$ does not contain any non trivial two sided ideals.","['abstract-algebra', 'semi-simple-rings', 'noncommutative-algebra']"

Problem Show that if $K$ is compact and nonempty, then $\sup K$ and $\inf K$ both exist and are elements of $K$ . Definitions Compact Set : A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact if every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in $K$ . Closed Set : A set $F \subseteq R$ is closed if it contains its limit points. Bounded Set :  A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded if there exists $M > 0$ such that $|a|\leq M$ for all $a \in A$ . Theorem 2.5.2. - Subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence. Theorem 3.3.4. - A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Lemma 1.3.8. Assume $s \in R$ is an upper bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ . Then, $s = \sup A$ if and only if, for every choice of $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists an element $a \in A$ satisfying $s - \epsilon < a$ . Assume $i \in R$ is a lower bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ . Then, $i = \inf A$ if and only if, for every choice of $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists an element $a \in A$ satisfying $a < i + \epsilon $ . Axiom of Completeness : Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound and every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound. Limit Point : A point $x$ is a limit point of a set $A$ if every $\epsilon$ -neighborhood $\mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(x)$ of $x$ intersects the set $A$ at some point other than $x$ . My Proof $\text{     }$ Suppose that a set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact and nonempty. Let $\alpha = \sup K$ for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ . First we want to show $\alpha$ exists and $\alpha \in K$ . By Theorem 3.3.4., $K$ is bounded, i.e. there exists $M > 0$ such that $-M \leq k \leq M$ for all $k \in K$ . This implies that $\alpha$ exists by the Axiom of Completeness. Now let $\epsilon > 0$ . By Lemma 1.3.8. we know that there exists an element $k \in K$ satisfying $\alpha - \epsilon < k$ . In particular, we have $\alpha - \epsilon < k < \alpha + \epsilon$ , which means that $k \in \mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\alpha)$ . Moreover, $\alpha$ is a limit point of $K$ since $k \in \mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\alpha) \cap K$ . Since $K$ is closed by Theorem 3.3.4., then we have $\alpha \in K$ , as desired. $\text{     }$ Let $\beta = \inf K$ for some $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ . What remains to be shown is that $\beta$ exists and $\beta \in K$ . Since $K$ is bounded by Theorem 3.3.4., the Axiom of Completeness implies that $\beta$ exists. Let $\epsilon > 0$ . By Lemma 1.3.8. we know that there exists an element $k \in K$ satisfying $\beta + \epsilon > k$ . In particular, we have $\beta + \epsilon > k > \beta - \epsilon$ , which means that $k \in \mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\beta)$ . Since $k \in \mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\beta) \cap K$ , we have that $\beta$ is a limit point of $K$ .

If $1-\omega$ divides every factor then we may write $$\begin{align}x+y&=u_1(1-\omega)\alpha^3\\x+\omega y&=u_2(1-\omega)\beta^3\\x+\omega^2y&=u_3(1-\omega)\gamma^3\end{align}\tag{4}$$ With $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ having no common factor. Taking norms we get $(x+y)^2=3N(\alpha)^3$ , therefore $3\mid N(\alpha)$ , and so $9\mid x+y$ . Let $k$ be the highest power such that $3^k\mid x+y$ , $k\geq 2$ . We can then write $$\begin{align}(x+y)^3&\equiv_{3^{3k}} 0\\x^3+3xy(x+y)+y^3&\equiv_{3^{3k}} 0\\xy(x+y)&\equiv_{3^{3k-1}} 0\end{align}\tag{5}$$ Therefore either $3\mid x$ or $3\mid y$ . This implies that $3\mid x,y,z$ . Contradiction. Therefore all three factors are relatively prime, and we may write $$x+y=u_1\alpha^3\\x+\omega y=u_2\beta^3\\x+\omega^2 y= u_3\gamma^3\tag{6}$$ Notice that since $(x+y)+\omega (x+\omega y)+\omega^2(x+\omega^2 y)=0$ , we also have $$u_1\alpha^3+\omega u_2\beta^3+\omega^2 u_3\gamma^3=0\tag{7}$$ Now, reduce eq. $(7)$ modulo $(1-\omega)^2$ . We're then working over the ring $\Bbb Z[\omega]/(1-\omega)^2$ . Since $(1-\omega)^2=(3)$ , we have $$\Bbb Z[\omega]/(1-\omega)^2\cong\Bbb Z_3[\omega]\cong\Bbb Z_9\tag{8}$$ In this ring we observe: A unit $u\in\Bbb Z[\omega]$ is still a unit $\Bbb Z[\omega]/(1-\omega)^2$ Proof : We prove a stronger result. Let $R$ be any ring with multiplicative identity $1\in R$ , and $I\subseteq R$ any ideal of $R$ . Let $\phi$ be the canonical map $$\phi: R\twoheadrightarrow R/I$$ Suppose $u\in R^\times$ is a unit. Then $1=\phi(1)=\phi(uu^{-1})=\phi(u)\phi(u^{-1})$ , so the image of $u$ , $\phi(u)$ , is a unit in $R/I$ . Suppose $u\in\Bbb Z_9$ is a unit. Then $u^3=\pm 1$ . Proof : Either note that for every unit $u\in\Bbb Z_9$ we have $$u^{\phi(9)}-1\equiv_9 u^6-1\equiv_9 (u^3-1)(u^3+1)\equiv_9 0$$ so it's impossible for both factors to be divisible by $3$ , since that would imply $(u^3+1)-(u^3-1)\equiv_3 0$ . Or make a table of all the units in $\Bbb Z_9$ and calculate the corresponding cubes: $$\begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline u & 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 8 \\ \hline u^3 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1\\\hline\end{array}$$ We can now conclude: Notice in eq. $(6)$ that $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\not\in (1-\omega)$ , so they must be units in $\Bbb Z[\omega]/(1-\omega)^2$ . Eq. $(7)$ now reduces to the sum of three terms who with value $\pm 1$ modulo $9$ $$(-1)^a+(-1)^b+(-1)^c\equiv_9 0$$ This is impossible.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'eisenstein-integers', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification', 'commutative-algebra']"

4083835,Question about pinch singularities,"I am reading the book ""Analytic S-matrix"" by Eden,Landshoff, Olive and Polkinghorne. In Sec.2, they discuss the different kinds of singularities of a function $f(z)$ defined as an integral of an analytic function $g(z,\omega)$ in the complex $\omega-$ plane along some closed contour $\mathcal{C}$ , i.e. $$
f(z) = \int_\mathcal{C}\, d\omega\, g(z,\omega)\,.
$$ It is assumed that we know the singularities of $g(z,\omega)$ . They discuss the case of pinch singularities, i.e. those singularities that approach the contour from the opposite sides and eventually coincide. As an example, they consider $$
f(z) = \int_0^1 \frac{d\omega}{(\omega-z)(\omega-a)}
$$ where the contour is not really specified. This is already strange... shouldn't they specify the contour? Their result is $$
f(z) = \frac{1}{z-a}\log{\left[\frac{a(1-z)}{(1-a)z}\right]}\,,\qquad(a>1)
$$ To perform this integral, I was thinking to take the parameterization $\omega(t) = \sqrt{t} e^{i \arccos{\sqrt{t}}}$ where $t\in [0,1]$ . This parameterization actually selects the path of a semi-cicle in the upper-half complex $\omega-$ plane, running from $\omega=0$ to $\omega=1$ . The integral then can be computed as $$
f(z) = \int_0^1 dt \frac{d\omega(t)}{dt}\frac{1}{(\omega(t)-z)(\omega(t)-a)}
$$ If $z=a>1$ or $z=a<0$ , the singularities of the integrand lie outside my integration path, and the integral is perfectly convergent. Under Eq.(2.1.5) of their book, the authors write the singularity at $z=a$ is only encountered on encircling one of the
logarithmic singularities, so that now $\log{1}$ is $\pm 2\pi i$ instead of zero and no longer cancels the pole. Can anyone explain to me what they mean by the last sentence?

$$ PS: Here is my attempted proof of the reverse inequality of (2) above. If $m^{***}(A) = \infty$ , then we trivially have $m^*(A) \leq m^{***}(A)$ . So let us assume that $m^{***}(A) < \infty$ . Then, for any closed set $F$ such that $F \subseteq A$ , we must have $m^*(F) \leq m^{***}(A) < \infty$ . Thus we have $m^*(F) < \infty$ for any closed set $F$ contained in $A$ . If $A$ is measurable, then by Theorem 11 (iii), Chap. 2, in Royden, for any real number $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists a closed set $F_\epsilon$ contained in $A$ for which $$
m^* \left( A \setminus F_\epsilon \right) < \epsilon. \tag{3} 
$$ But as $F_\epsilon$ is a closed set, so $F_\epsilon$ is measurable, and as $F_\epsilon \subseteq A$ , so we also have $m^*\left( F_\epsilon \right) < \infty$ . Therefore (3) together with the excision property yields $$
m^*(A) - m^* \left( F_\epsilon \right) = m^* \left( A \setminus F_\epsilon \right) < \epsilon, 
$$ which implies $$
m^*(A) < m^* \left( F_\epsilon \right) + \epsilon \leq m^{***}(A) + \epsilon,
$$ which in turn implies $$
m^*(A) \leq m^{***}(A) + \epsilon 
$$ for any real number $\epsilon > 0$ , and therefore we can conclude that $$
m^*(A) \leq m^{***}(A). \tag{4} 
$$ If $A$ is not measurable, then by Prob. Prob. 17, Chap. 2, in Royden, there exists a real number $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that, for any open set $O$ and for any closed set $F$ such that $F \subseteq A \subset O$ , we have $$
m^*(O \setminus F ) \geq \epsilon_0. \tag{5} 
$$ But any closed set is measurable, and in particular any closed set $F$ contained in $A$ is measurable with finite outer measure; we therefore have $$
m^*(O \setminus F) = m^*(O) - m^*(F),
$$ by the excision property, and the last identity together with (5) gives $$
m^*(O) - m*(F) \geq \epsilon_0,
$$ and thus we have $$
m^*(O) \geq m^*(F) + \epsilon_0. \tag{5} 
$$ What next? How to proceed from here and prove that (4) above holds in the case when $A$ is not measurable?","['measure-theory', 'outer-measure', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Because there are exactly $2^\kappa$ pairwise non-homeomorphic metrizable topologies on any infinite cardinal $\kappa$ , I can't disprove the existence of such a topological space by a simple size argument. My guess is that it is either independent of ZFC or it is provably false for all cardinals of size at least $2^{\aleph_0}$ , using some notion of path-connectivity. Edit: By the Kowalski's theorem , any space with a basis of cardinality $\kappa$ , so notably any space of cardinality $\kappa$ , can be embedded in the product of countably many $\kappa$ -Hedgehog spaces. There is a simple proof of this theorem based mostly on the fact that any metrizable space has a $\sigma$ -discrete basis.

4084820,The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is countable. Is my proof correct?,"Question Prove: The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is countable I assume the following results: A countable union of countable sets is countable. A finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable. If for any set $A$ there is a bijective correspondence with some countable set $B$ , then $A$ is countable. Attempt This is my attempted proof of the statement: Proof Let $J$ denote the set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ . Then $J = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+} J_n$ , where $J_n$ is the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with $n$ elements. We prove that $J_n$ is countable by showing that for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ there exists a bijective function $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^n \rightarrow J_n$ such that for any tuple $(k_1,k_2,...,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_+^n$ , the following conditions hold: The set $f(k_1, k_2,...,k_n)$ contains $n$ elements The largest element in $f(k_1,k_2,...,k_n)$ is $\sum_{i=1}^nk_i$ . We use induction. Base case $n = 1$ is trivial, since we can define a function $f(n) = \{n\}$ , which is clearly bijective and satisfies the above conditions. Thus, assume that the result holds for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ . Hence, there exists $f_k: \mathbb{Z}^k_+ \rightarrow J_k$ which is a bijection satisfying the above properties. To show that the result holds for $k+1$ , define $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^{k+1} \rightarrow J_{k+1}$ as follows: \begin{align*}
    f(n_1,n_2,...,n_{k+1}) = f_k(n_1,...n_k) \cup \{n_1+n_2+n_3+...+n_{k+1}\}
\end{align*} By the inductive hypothesis, the set $f_k(n_1,...,n_k)$ contains $k$ distinct elements and the largest element is $\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i$ . Thus, since: \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i < \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}n_i
\end{align*} it follows that $f$ satisfies conditions (1) and (2). Then since $f_k$ is bijective and the last element in $f(n_1,...,n_{k+1})$ is not in $f_k(n_1,...,n_k)$ , the bijectivity of $f$ follows. Hence, the result holds for $k+1$ . Thus, since $\mathbb{Z}_+^n$ is countable and there exists a bijection $f : \mathbb{Z}_+^n \rightarrow J_n$ , it follows that $J_n$ is countable for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ . Therefore, since $J_n$ is countable, we conclude that $J = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+} J_n $ is countable $\space \Box$ Is this proof correct? If so, how can I improve it?

4084869,Derivatives of a recursively and implicitly defined polynomial,"I'm studying Frobenius Manifolds associated with $A_n$ -type singularities and in order to prove some results about their potentials I need to calculate the following thing. Assume that $n$ is a fixed natural number and there is a finite family of $n-1$ polynomials with rational coefficients on $n-1$ variables $f_q(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$ for $1\leqslant q \leqslant n-1$ , whose coefficients and the polynomials themselves are defined recursively. Moreover, each polynomial is defined as a sum over all tuples of natural numbers which subject to a condition on their sum. The main question is the following:
how to calculate partial derivatives (actually I need only second ones, i.e. a Hessian matrix) of these objects? Maybe some more explicit details could help to calculate derivatives, so let me define the family which I am interested in. Firstly, let me define recursively the numbers $P_n(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ for a fixed natural number $n$ and an $m$ -tuple of natural numbers $(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ as follows: $$P_n(s_1)=s_1$$ $$P_n(s_1,\dots,s_m) = \binom{n}{m} - \sum\limits_{q=1}^{m-1} P_n(s_1,\dots,s_q) \binom{n-q-(s_1+\cdots+s_q)}{m-q}$$ where I assume that $\binom{p}{t} = 0$ are defined as usual for $p\geqslant t \geqslant 0$ and $0$ otherwise.
For instance, $P_n(s_1,\dots,s_m) = 0$ for $m\geqslant n+1$ . Now I define the main object, namely a family of polynomials with rational coefficients $x_{-q}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$ ( $n$ is still a fixed natural number) for $q \geqslant 0$ as follows: $x_{0} = 0$ and $x_{-q}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$ for $q > 0$ is defined recursively via $$x_{-q} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{m=2}^{n}\sum P_n(s_1,\dots,s_m) x_{n-s_1}\cdots x_{n-s_m}$$ where the second sum is taken over all natural numbers $(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^m s_i = q+n+1-m$ . For example, here is the list of them for $n=3$ (one can also prove that $x_{-n}$ are always equal to zero): $$x_{-1} = -x_1x_2$$ $$x_{-2} = -x_1^2-\frac{x_2^3}{3}$$ Then I need to compute all second partial derivatives of $x_{-q}$ (i.e. Hessian matrix $H_{n,q}$ of $x_{-q}$ ) for any $n$ and $1\leqslant q \leqslant n-1$ and it is the point where I've been completely stuck. I need these derivatives in order to check some equalities involving them and I   am able to found them via direct calculations for some small numbers $n$ , but I can't cope with the general case because the coefficients $P_n$ and the polynomials $x_{-q}$ are defined recursively and moreover $x_{-q}$ is defined via the implicit summation condition, that's why I do not understand how to write down a closed formula for any $n$ . Actually I can prove it, but only for $q=1$ . In this case it follows from some general theory of Frobenius Manifolds that $-H_{n,1}$ is equal to the pairing matrix for $A_{n-1}$ -type Frobenius Manifold which is just an antidiagonal matrix I'd appreciate any help and thoughts on the computation or even on some properties of the coefficients $P_n$ , polynomials $x_{-q}$ or their Hessian matrix.","['singularity-theory', 'recurrence-relations', 'polynomials', 'partial-derivative', 'derivatives']"

4085229,Explicit solution to ODE $rg''(r)= \gamma g(r)^2$.,"While working on a project, I have come across a function $g\in C^\infty((0,\infty),\mathbb{R})$ satisfying the ODE $$ r g''(r) = \gamma g(r)^2,\quad r > 0,$$ where $\gamma$ is some positive constant. I know also that $g > 0$ , $g$ must be decreasing, $\lim_{r\to 0} g(r) < \infty$ is a constant I know, and $g(r) = o(r^{-1/2})$ for large $r$ . I believe these constraints should determine $g$ uniquely, and the ODE looks (to my untrained eye) simple enough that I'm hoping there is an explicit solution, but I couldn't find one (other than $\frac{2}{\gamma r}$ , which doesn't fit my constraints). As I don't have a particularly rich background in differential equations, I would be grateful for an insight of any kind. After a bit of research, I found that this equation falls into the class of Emden-Fowler equations ( $n=-1,m=2$ in the notation of the link), but I couldn't find explicit solutions for this particular case. Another thing I noted was that defining $f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}\to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \frac{g(|x|)}{|x|}$ for $x\in \mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}$ yields a positive function $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus \{0\})$ with $$\Delta f = \gamma f^2,$$ since the Laplacian in three dimensions, when applied to spherically symmetric functions, can be written as $\Delta_\text{radial} = \frac 1r \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} (r \, \cdot)$ .
