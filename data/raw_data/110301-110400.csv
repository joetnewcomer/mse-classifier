1589733,An exercise on series of function convergence $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(n+1)^x}{n^2 \ln n}$.,I am asked to show the various tipes of convergence of this series: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(n+1)^x}{n^2 \ln n}$$ where $x \in R$. I notice that for  $x \ge 1$ the series diverges because $ \frac{n}{n^2 \ln n} < \frac{n+1}{n^2 \ln n}$ and $\frac{1}{n \ln n}$ diverges from the integral test. Anyone mind helping me with $x < 1$?

Show that if $m(A)=0$ and $f:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ has bounded derivative then $m(f(A))=0$. ($m$ denotes Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$) If $m(A)=0$ then for any $\epsilon>0$ there is open set $G\subset [0,1]$ such that $A\subset G$ and $m(G)<\epsilon /B$.

For every $G_i$ and any two points $x,y$ in $G_i$ from MVT we know that $$|f(x)-f(y)|<B |x-y| \mbox{.}$$ Also since $G_1,G_2,\ldots$ are disjoint we know that $f(A)\subset f(G)=\bigcup_i f(G_i)$. Finally $$m(f(A))\le m(f(G))\le\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}m(f(G_i))<\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}Bm(G_i)<B \epsilon / B=\epsilon$$ (Above I have also used the fact that continuous function maps connected subsets to connected subsets) My question is if the above reasoning is correct.

1589819,Is $H$-measure actually monotonic (at least on hyperrectangles)?,"I am currently reading Introduction to Copulas by R. B. Nelson . First chapter introduces some theory of 2-monotone functions and I am trying to extend it for $n$-dimensional hyperrectangles as an exercise. It still unclear for me if $H$-measure is a real measure or at least monotone (the property I crave the most). The theory is following: Let $S_i$ be a family of $n$ subsets of $\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, \infty\} $. Then, we call a function of type $H: \prod^n_{i=1}S_i \to \mathbb{R}$  $n$-place real-valued function. For every $n$-dimensional hyperrectangle $R$ of form $R = \prod^n_{i=1} [a_i,b_i]$ with $a,b \in \prod^n_{i=1}S_i$ we define its $H$-volume by $$V_H(R) = \Delta^{b_n}_{a_n} \ldots \Delta^{b_2}_{a_2}\Delta^{b_1}_{a_1}H = \sum_{I \in \{ 1,2\}^n} (-1)^{\sum^n_{i = 1} I_i}H[I] $$
where $H[I] = H(x_{I_1},x_{I_2}, \ldots, x_{I_n})$ having $x_{I_k} = a_k$ if $I_k = 1$ and $b_k$ otherwise. Here is an example for $\mathbb{R}^2$:
$$V_H(R) = H(b_1,b_2) - H(a_1,b_2) - H(b_1,a_2) + H(a_1,a_2)$$ If $\forall R . V_H(R) \ge 0$ then $H$ is called $n$-increasing or quasi-monotone and $V_H(R)$ is called an $H$-measure of $R$. This invokes the idea that $V_H$ is indeed acts as measure, hence it is monotone i. e. $$\forall R,T. R \subset T \Rightarrow V_H(R) \le V_H(T)$$ Now, I think that it's possible to look at this measure as normall integral.
$$V_H(R) = \int_R \mathrm{d}^n\, H(p)$$ And Equality can be shown by multiple application of Stokes' theorem to Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral. To get monotonicity we just need to ensure  $H$ is nondeacrising in every coordinate, which we have in case $H$ is grounded i.e there are some least element $z_i$ in each $S_i$ and $f(\ldots, z_i, \ldots) =0.$  I think we can consider it to be grounded with only little lose of generality.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"
1589834,Compact Hausdorff Spaces with pre-caliber $\aleph_1$ has caliber $\aleph_1$,"Let us recall that a topological space has $\aleph_1$ pre-caliber (resp. caliber) if given any family of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha<\omega_1}$ there exists an uncontable set $B\subset\omega_1$ such that the subfamily $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in B}$ has the finite intersection property (resp. $\bigcap_{\alpha\in B} U_\alpha\neq\emptyset$).

1589844,Show that the roots of P' lie in the same half plane as the roots of P,"The problem statement is: Part(a) Assume P(z) is a non-constant polynomial with all of its roots in some half plane H.  Show that the derivative P'(z) must also have all of its roots in H. Part (b) Show that the roots of P' always lie within the closed convex hull of the set of roots of P. The hint given is: After obvious reductions of the problem, look at the behavior of $\frac{P'}{P}$ on the complementary half-plane. My thoughts: So I think that, whatever half-plane H that we have to work with, we can always just look at $P(e^{i\theta}z)$, which has its zeros in the UHP, for a suitable rotation by angle theta. Now we can just show that $P'(e^{i\theta}z)e^{i\theta}$ also has its roots in the UHP -- and then undoing the rotations shows that both P and P' had its roots in the same half-plane H. Using the hint regarding looking at the complementary half-plane, we then want to show that P' does not vanish in the LHP (we already know P doesn't vanish in the LHP, by assumption.) Again following the hint we look at P'/P in the LHP and show that it does not vanish.  I am stuck at this point.  How can I proceed? And regarding part(b) what is a ""convex hull""?  I am guessing that the answer to part (b) is immediate, after figuring out part(a). Any ideas are welcome. Thanks,","['derivatives', 'polynomials', 'roots', 'complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry']"
1589887,"Cardinality as ""size of a set"" [closed]","Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question Given the discussions on Refuting the Anti-Cantor Cranks in which I left a comment that I suspected would not get any attention, I decided to start a new thread instead. Now, I can't read the mind of ""anti-Cantorians"" so I don't really know what their objections are. But I get the impression that most reasonable objections aren't based upon the validity of the proofs that $\mathbb{R}$ has higher cardinality than $\mathbb{N}$. That seems pretty undisputable. But a viewpoint I personally haven't been able to shake is the notion of cardinality as capable of describing ""sizes"" of sets. Now, different people may have different views on which criteria this notion of size absolutely needs to adhere to and which we can discard, but I think it's certainly thinkable to require that any reasonable notion of size needs to satisfy $B \subset A \Rightarrow \text{size}(B) < \text{size}(A).$ Starting from the assumption that $B \subset A \Rightarrow \text{size}(B) < \text{size}(A)$, then the statement ""if two sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence with each other, then they are of the same size"" leads to a contradiction and can therefore not be true, leading us to a chicken-and-egg axiom argument with no right answer. Which makes me wonder. Could the interpretation of cardinality as the ""size of a set"" simply be seen as a mneumonic? Am I wrong in assuming all mathematical results relating to cardinalities of sets will be as relevant without thinking of it as a ""size""? What does the interpretation really buy us and what would we lose by leaving the notion of the size of an infinite set undefined? EDIT: The very nice discussion in Relative sizes of sets of integers and rationals revisited - how do I make sense of this? is probably sufficient for this question, but I'll reiterate my position since it apparently wasn't as clearly formulated as I thought given the down-votes. We want a nice, intuitive notion of the ""size"" (or better yet, ""numerosity"") of a set. So we make a list of properties that we know hold for finite sets that ideally we would want to hold for infinite sets. Two of these: 1) If you can take all the elements of set $A$ and place each element next to a unique member of set $B$, then $A$ and $B$ are ""of the same size"". 2) If you take a set $A$ and proceed by removing some elements from it, then you will have a set smaller in size than you started out with. Taking the first one as an axiom leads to the concept of ""cardinality"", causing property 2 to lead to a contradiction, while taking the second one as an axiom leads to the first one causing a contradiction. Clearly we can't have both of them. From some answers and comments, you get the impression that expecting the second property to hold is a ""fallacy"", sprung through some naive expectation that properties of finite sets should automatically carry over to infinite sets. But it seems to me that the same could be said for the first property. The only reason to prefer using #1 as a definition seems to be ""more interesting mathematics spring from it"", which is clearly an excellent reason - but it doesn't make it a more natural candidate for capturing the notion of size than #2. EDIT #2: There was an excellent point brought up in the question I linked above which is the formulation of various closure operations on sets - for example the convex hull of a $A$ is the smallest convex set containing $A$. So letting $A = \{0,1\}$, what's its convex hull? Well, $[0,1]$ certainly can't be the unique correct answer, since $\mathbb{R}$ is of the same size! Not that this invalidates the cardinality concept, but it shows that maybe we should be careful with equating cardinality with size.",['elementary-set-theory']
1589888,Product of two series to get a series decomposition of zeta in the critical strip,"$\def\sfrac#1#2{%
    \small#1%
    \kern-.05em\lower0.1ex/\kern-.025em%
    \lower0.4ex\small#2}$I've been working on gaining an intuitive understanding of the analytic continuation of the zeta function, but I've gotten stuck at this part where I have to multiply two very strange series together. The approach is quite simple: first start with the Dirichlet eta function, defined by $η(s) = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{-1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{-1}{4^s} + ... $. Then the following relationship holds: $ζ(s) = η(s) · \frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{2^s}}$ If $\Re\{s\} > 1$, then the right factor can be expanded into a Taylor series, yielding $ζ(s) = \left(\frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{-1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{-1}{4^s} + ... \right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{2}{2^s} + \frac{4}{4^s} + \frac{8}{8^s} + ... \right) \\
= \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{1}{4^s} + ...$ where the product can be evaluated as a Dirichlet convolution. This is because the image of $\frac{2}{2^s}$ lies within the radius of convergence of the $1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...$ series expansion of $\frac{1}{1-x}$, so the Taylor expansion is valid. However, if $\Re\{s\} < 1$, then the image of $\frac{2}{2^s}$ lies outside the ROC, so that expansion doesn't work. Instead, we can take advantage of the functional equation $f(x) + f(\frac{1}{x}) = 1$ where $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$. Substituting in $x=\frac{2}{2^s}$, and allowing that $\frac{1}{\left(\frac{2}{2^s}\right)} = \frac{\sfrac{1}{2}}{{\sfrac{1}{2}}^s}$, you get $\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{2^s}} = 1 - \frac{1}{1-\frac{\sfrac{1}{2}}{{\sfrac{1}{2}}^s}}$ where $\frac{\sfrac{1}{2}}{{\sfrac{1}{2}}^s}$ now has an image lying within the ROC of the aforementioned series expansion for $\Re\{s\} < 1$. So we can expand the whole right side as $\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{2^s}} = \frac{-\sfrac{1}{2}}{{\sfrac{1}{2}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{4}}{{\sfrac{1}{4}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{8}}{{\sfrac{1}{8}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{16}}{{\sfrac{1}{16}}^s} + ...$ Finally, putting the whole thing together, we get $ζ(s) = \left(\frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{-1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{-1}{4^s} + ... \right) \cdot \left(\frac{-\sfrac{1}{2}}{{\sfrac{1}{2}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{4}}{{\sfrac{1}{4}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{8}}{{\sfrac{1}{8}}^s} + \frac{-\sfrac{1}{16}}{{\sfrac{1}{16}}^s} + ...\right)$ Which, for $0 < \Re\{s\} < 1$, is the product of a conditionally convergent Dirichlet series, and an absolutely convergent ""fractional Dirichlet series."" And here I'm stumped. How can I expand this product? I understand the result should be some kind of ""fractional Dirichlet series"" where the denominators are dyadic rationals raised to the power of s, and I understand I basically want to perform some kind of Dirichlet convolution type thing here. But how do I actually do it? What does the resulting expression look like?","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-number-theory', 'riemann-zeta', 'dirichlet-series']"

1589927,Limit of $\sin(x)$ as $x$ approaches zero from the left,"I'm trying to find a proof that:
$$ \lim_{x\to0^-}\sin(x)=0$$
I'd like to be able to do the proof without reference to advanced theorems (mean value theorem, series, etc). I have a geometric approach for finding the limit from the right, but I need similar help when approaching zero from the left. Thanks. Update : I am about to prove that the sine is continuous at any value $a$, but I first need to prove that 
$$\lim_{\theta\to0}\sin\theta=0\quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{\theta\to0}\cos\theta=1.$$ 
I've already shown that $f$ is continuous at $a$ if 
$$\lim_{h\to 0}f(a+h)=f(a),$$ 
so then I can show 
$$\lim_{h\to0}\sin(a+h)=\sin(a),$$ 
which implies that the sine is continuous at any $a$. But to do that last step, I need 
$$\lim_{\theta\to0}\sin\theta=0 \quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{\theta\to0}\cos\theta=1.$$ 
Thus, I need to prove each of these without using continuity. I've shown that $\lim_{\theta\to0^+}\sin\theta=0$ using the following image: The area of the triangle is $\frac12r^2\sin\theta$ and the area of the sector is $\frac12r^2\theta$, so,
$$0\le\frac12r^2\sin\theta\le\frac12r^2\theta,$$
which simplifies to:
$$0\le \sin\theta\le \theta$$
By the squeeze theorem, this makes $\lim_{\theta\to0+}\sin\theta=0$. Now I need a proof that $\lim_{\theta\to0^-}\sin\theta=0$. Update: Due to all the nice help I received, it turns out that if $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$, then
$$\sin\theta\le\theta$$
which, which because $\sin\theta$ and $\theta$ are both positive on $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$, is equivalent to
$$|\,\sin\theta\,|<|\,\theta\,|.$$
Secondly, if $-\pi/2\le\theta\le0$, then $0\le-\theta\le\pi/2$. Hence, we can substitute $-\theta$ in the last inequality, which leads to:
$$\begin{align*}
|\sin(-\theta)\,|&\le|-\theta\,|\\
|-\sin(\theta)\,|&\le|-\theta\,|\\
|\sin(\theta)\,|&\le|\,\theta\,|
\end{align*}$$
Therefore, if $-\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi/2$, then
$$|\sin(\theta)\,|\le|\,\theta\,|.$$
The last step is due to the fact that $|-x|=|x|$ for all real numbers $x$. This last inequality is equivalent to
$$-|\,\theta\,|\le\sin\theta\le|\,\theta\,|,$$
and by the squeeze theorem, since both ends go to zero as $\theta\to0$, I've shown that
$$\lim_{\theta->0}\sin\theta=0.$$","['proof-verification', 'calculus', 'limits']"

1590046,Four of a kind -dilemma,"CONDITIONS Imagine, that we have five standard 52-card decks . We will now mix all these five decks into a one ( afterwards ""big deck"" , 260 cards in total ). Now our task is to turn all the cards open, one card at a time, until we can form "" four of a kind "" from these cards that have been turned open ( ""dealt"" ). QUESTION: What is the maximum number of these cards to be dealt (in worst case scenario), where we still can not form any "" four of a kind "" that consists of: 1) any four cards that have the same numeric value (example ""8♥ 8♥ 8♣ 8♣"" or ""J♥ J♣ J♣ J♣""); 2) four completely suited cards (example ""K♥ K♥ K♥ K♥"" or ""7♣ 7♣ 7♣ 7♣""). 3) four completely offsuited cards (example ""K♥ K♦ K♣ K♠"" or ""7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 7♠""). The suite of those cards that doesn't form a four of a kind is irrelevant (they can be both suited or offsuited ). My anwsers 1) any four of a kind We simply run three of a kinds for all 13 different numeric values (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and suit doesn't matter). We now get a total of 39 cards. $$
(3 \cdot 13)  = 39
$$ The 40th card to be dealt needs to gives us one four of a kind no matter what card it is. So my anwser is 39 (40th card will give us four of a kind - suited or offsuited ). Note that the number of decks used is irrelevant for the assigment (assuming that we use at least one complete deck of cards). 2) four of a kind - suited Here we need to avoid any four of a kind that consists of the same suit. What were gonna do is to deal three cards from all suits per numeric value (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) - three of each, because the whole idea is to avoid the 4th. Now we have a total of 12 cards per numeric value like this A♥ A♥ A♥, A♦ A♦ A♦, A♣ A♣ A♣, A♠ A♠ A♠ and 2♥ 2♥ 2♥, 2♦ 2♦ 2♦, 2♣ 2♣ 2♣, 2♠ 2♠ 2♠ ect. As there are 13 different numeric values (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K), there is a maximum of $12 * 13 = 156$ different cards without any four of a kind: same suit . Let's deal these cards described above and see where we stand. The next one, let's make it a six of clubs (6♠), is the fourth six of clubs dealt, so the result is 156. No matter what the card to be dealt is, it will inevitably be the 4th of that specific suite and value. Since the 157th card dealt will always give us four of a kind that consists of four same suit and value , we have now reached the maximum. Note that for this task there must be at least four decks used. Any added deck after four doesn't effect at all; the limit comes from the fact that there are only 13 different numeric values per deck. 3) four of a kind - offsuited We deal all cards from all 5 decks, except one suit (in this example we exclude spade ♠): A♥ A♥ A♥ A♥ A♥, A♦ A♦ A♦ A♦ A♦, A♣ A♣ A♣ A♣ A♣ and 2♥ 2♥ 2♥ 2♥ 2♥, 2♦ 2♦ 2♦ 2♦ 2♦, 2♣ 2♣ 2♣ 2♣ 2♣ ect., so we got a total of 15 individual cards for each numeric value. As we have 13 different numeric values in five decks, and all the spades will be taken out of the deck, we are left with a total of 195 cards. There is also an opposite way to do this. First let's calculate $$
X \cdot Y  = 65
$$ Where X is the number of spades per deck ( 13 ) and Y is the number of the decks used ( 5 ). We now substitute 65 from original 260 cards and our anwser is 195. We can also do this also by $$
(A \cdot B) \cdot C = 195
$$ where A is number of one suit per deck, B is number of suits minus one suit  (not including one suit) and C is the number of decks used. The anwser to this is 195 cards, that still won't make any offsuited four of a kind . Changing the number of decks used makes a big difference in the math (four decks will do $(13 * 3) * 4 = 156$ for example). Here is the previous equation again: $$
(A + B + C) \cdot X  = 195
$$ Where A is number hearts per value in 5 decks (5), B is number of diamonds per value in 5 decks (5), C is number of clubs per value in 5 decks (5) and Y is number of different numeric values in a card deck (13). Given that we now have used all hearts , diamonds and clubs in the deck, the next card dealt, 196th in order, must be spade, because there are no other cards left in our big deck. The 196th card creates the first four of a kind specified in article 3) . Note that the more decks we use, the more cards of the same suite we can deal. If we use only one deck, the result is the same as in article 1) : 39 cards - 40th will make the first four of a kind, offsuited of course up to three decks, because there just cannot be four ace of spades in three standard 52-card decks.

1590081,Two-sample permutation tests for earthquake magnitudes before and after a damaging quake,"Background and data. An earthquake of magnitude 5.17 stuck near Yountville, California in the early morning hours of  September  9, 2000, injuring about 25 people and doing about $50 million damage. The magnitudes of 24 smaller earthquakes nearby are given in the vector Mag below. The first 12 occurred within the few hours before the big quake and the last 12 occurred within a few hours after.
The issue  is whether the Before and After quakes differ significantly from each other in magnitude. Mag=c(1.00, 1.14, 1.05, 1.79, 1.64, 2.76,  1.42, 1.30, 1.14, 0.96, 1.62, 1.40,
       2.06, 1.64, 1.87, 1.41, 1.18, 1.59,  0.95, 1.54, 2.00, 1.16, 0.93, 1.90) The two boxplots below show magnitudes of these two groups of earthquakes. Within the boxes, vertical lines show the sample medians and dots show their sample means. The outlier at 2.76 among those before the main quake might be called a foreshock. The quakes that occurred after the main one include some mild aftershocks. Traditional tests may be inappropriate. We wish to test $H_0: \mu_B = \mu_A$ against $H_a: \mu_B \ne \mu_A.$ Because the general population of California earthquake magnitudes is known to be distinctly right-skewed and our samples are small, one may be reluctant to use a two-sample t test to determine whether the two population means differ. (This test, which assumes normal data, gives the p-value 0.66, indicating no significant difference.) Ordinarily, the substitute would be a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon nonparmatric rank sum test, which tests whether population medians are equal. However, tied magnitudes (with values 1.14 and 1.64) would require adjustments in order test whether the population medians are equal (it shows an approximate p-value of 0.42). (And there are other quibbles with the applicability of the MWW test.)
By contrast, there are no problematic assumptions for permutation tests. Our purpose here is use appropriate $permutation\: tests$ to see whether the Before and After populations differ, and to compare the results of permutation tests with those for the t and MWW tests.","['statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

1590116,Find combinations of N sets having no more than one item in common.,"Problem definition; There are N input sets, of sizes $S_1, S_2, ... ,S_N$. eg; 4 sets - (1a,2a,3a,4a,5a), (1b,2b,3b,4b), (1c,2c,3c), (1d,2d,3d) A combination is made by selecting one item from each input set. eg; [1a, 1b, 1c, 1d] Rule: No chosen combination may have more than one item in common with any other. eg if [1a, 1b, 1c, 1d] is one combination, no other combination may have more than one of 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d. The aim is to make an output set containing the maximum number of combinations allowed by the rule. eg ([1a,1b,1c,1d],[1a,2b,2c,2d],[1a,3b,3c,3d],[2a,1b,2c,3d],[2a,2b,3c,1d],[2a,3b,1c,2d],[3a,1b,3c,2d],[3a,2b,1c,3d],[3a,3b,2c,1d]) So far I've; Realised that without the rule, there are simply $S_1 \times S_2 \times \dots \times S_N$ combinations, and that the answer is some subset of those. Written a brute-force solver that finds different valid combinations. Realised that for many cases the highest number of valid combinations is the product of the smallest two set sizes. But not all; For example if input sets have sizes $\{3,3,3,3,3\}$ there's only $6$ valid combinations. Realised that there are local maxima to beware of - not all partial output sets can be completed to the same size. eg for sizes $\{2,2,2\}$, if the partial output set is ([1a,1b,1c],[2a,2b,2c], ...) no more can be added. I'd like to; Calculate how many combinations there are without brute-force solving, given some input set sizes $S_0, S_1, ... ,S_N$. From a given total $T$, calculate the highest number of combinations that can be produced from input set sizes summing to $T$; $T = \sum_{i=1}^N S_i$. Not-Solution I've found a sub-problem that if solved might be a solution to this problem. If one takes the solution for $N-1$ of those input sets and puts them into a minimal number of sets of completely unique combinations (zero items in common), then $S_N$ of those sets can be completed with an element from the $N^{th}$ set. Example: If sizes are $\{3, 3, 3\}$, look at $\{3,3\}$ Combinations are ([1a,1b],[1a,2b],[1a,3b],[2a,1b],[2a,2b],[2a,3b],[3a,1b],[3a,2b],[3a,3b]) Find minimal number of sets of combinations of zero common items: ([1b,1c],[2b,2c],[3b,3c]) ([1b,2c],[2b,1c]) ([1b,3c],[3b,1c]) ([2b,3c],[3b,2c]) Complete at most $S_N$ of those rows with values from the $N^(th)$ set: (largest sets first) ([1a,1b,1c],[1a,2b,2c],[1a,3b,3c]) ([2a,1b,2c],[2a,2b,1c]) ([3a,1b,3c],[3a,3b,1c]) This addresses the reason that the number of combinations is not always the product of the two smallest set sizes.

(2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I'm a beginning student of Probability and Statistics and I've been reading the book Elementary Probability for Applications by Rick Durret. In this book, he outlines the 4 Axioms of Probability. For any event $A$, $0 \leq P (A) \leq 1$. If $\Omega $ is the sample space then $P (\Omega) =1$. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, that is, the intersection $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then
$$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$ If $A_1, A_2,\ldots$, is an infinite sequence of pairwise disjoint events (that is, $A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset$ when $i \neq j $) then
 $$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i).$$ The book fails to explain why we need Axiom 4. I have tried searching on Wikipedia but I haven't had any luck. I don't understand how we can have a probability of disjoint infinite events. The book states that when the you have infinitely many events, the last argument breaks down and this is now a new assumption. But then the book states that we need this or else the theory of Probability becomes useless. I was wondering if there were any intuitive examples of situations where this fourth axiom applies. Why is it so important for probabilty theory? And why does the author state that not everyone believes we should use this axiom.","['probability-theory', 'axioms', 'probability', 'statistics']"

3rd die : $1,2,0,0,0,0$ I am trying to calculate the different probabilities of each possible sum outcome (sum of $0,1,2,3$ and $4$). Would it be fair to assume that what follows is true? The probability of having a sum of $1$ on the $3$ dice is equal to (1st dice, 2nd dice, third dice) :
$\frac{1}{6} (1) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) \times \frac{4}{6} (0)  +  \frac{5}{6} (0) \times \frac{2}{6} (1) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) + \frac{5}{6} (0) \times \frac{4}{6} (0) \times \frac{1}{6} (1) = \frac{76}{216}$ or $35.19\%$ For the sum of $1$, I assumed that to have this sum, only one die can have '$1$' and the other two '$0$' so I find the probability for each set of dice (chance of '$1$' $\times$ chance of not '$1$' $\times$ chance of not '$1$').

Let $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ be a homomorphism of rings, and let $f: Y \rightarrow X$ be the induced continuous map on the spectra, where $X = Spec(A), Y = Spec(B)$, and $f(\mathfrak q) = \phi^{-1}\mathfrak q$.  If $\mathfrak q \in Y$, there is a natural local homomorphism of local rings $\phi_{\mathfrak q}: A_{\phi^{-1}\mathfrak q} \rightarrow B_{\mathfrak q}$.  We have a usual morphisms of sheaves $f^{\#}: \mathcal O_X \rightarrow f_{\ast} \mathcal O_Y$.  I'm trying to prove that if $\phi$ is injective, then so is $f^{\#}$.  I've been trying to prove this by showing that the induced homomorphism on the stalks $f_{\mathfrak p}^{\#}$ is injective for all $\mathfrak p \in X$. We can identify $A_{\mathfrak p}$ with $\mathcal O_{X,\mathfrak p}$ by sending any $\frac{a}{s} \in A_{\mathfrak p}$ to the equivalence class $(t, D(s))$, where $t \in \mathcal O_X (D(s))$ is the function $t(\mathfrak p')= \frac{a}{s} \in A_{\mathfrak p'}$ for all $\mathfrak p' \in D(s)$. Now $$(f_{\ast}\mathcal O_Y)_{\mathfrak p} = \varinjlim\limits_{U \ni \mathfrak p} \mathcal O_Y(f^{-1}U)$$ and the map on the stalks $f^{\#}_{\mathfrak p}$ sends $(t,D(s))$ to the equivalence class $(t', f^{-1}D(s)) \in (f_{\ast}\mathcal O_Y)_{\mathfrak p}$, where $t' \in \mathcal O_Y(f^{-1}D(s))$ is the function given by $$t'(\mathfrak q) = \phi_{\mathfrak q}(t(\phi^{-1}\mathfrak q)) = \phi_{\mathfrak q}(\frac{a}{s}) := \frac{\phi(a)}{\phi(s)} \in B_{\mathfrak q}$$ for all $\mathfrak q \in f^{-1}D(s) = \{\mathfrak q \in \textrm{Spec } B : s \not\in \phi^{-1} \mathfrak q\}$.  If $(t', f^{-1}D(s))$ is the zero element, we need to argue that $\frac{a}{s} = 0$.  I have gotten nowhere with this.  Also, what if $f^{-1}D(s)$ is empty?

Now let's call $x \in M$ a perfect power if $x = y \wedge z$ for some $y, z \in M$. Moreover, let's say that $M$ is power-complete if all of its elements are perfect powers. For example, the trivial pasture $\{0\}$ is clearly power-complete. Question: Does a nontrivial power-complete finite pasture exist? I was inspired to ask this question after running a computer search for finite pastures and noticing that they tend to have few perfect powers. In fact, most of the pastures I found had a single perfect power, often (but not always) $0$. If my code is correct, then I have confirmed that no pasture of order $\le 8$ is power-complete, and moreover that no commutative unital pasture of order $\le 10$ is power-complete.

Here are my thoughts : This « non-trivial fixed point condition » is sometimes a strong condition. For instance, if $G = \mathbb Z$, then the only $f \in \text{Hom}(G,G)$ to have a non-trivial fixed point is the identity. The set of fixed point $\{y \in G \mid f(y)=y\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. Let $G = \mathbb Z / n\mathbb Z$. Assume that $n=ab$ with $a,b>1$. If $f([1]_n) = [a+1]_n$, then $f$ has a non trivial fixed point, namely $x=[b]_n$. This question may be «artificial» ; I don't know if a morphism with a non trivial fixed point can be useful in other contexts... I don't see a natural way to turn this problem into a « group action » problem (to get some results about fixed points).

We want to prove that $\exists! x_0 \in \mathbb R: f(x_0)=0$. Disclaimer: I am fully aware that there is a simple proof involving Rolle's theorem. This is not the proof I am after.

We have that $0 \leq g'(x) \leq 1-\frac{c}{d}<1$ Now, since $f$ is $C^1$, we also have that $g$ is $C^1$. And more specifically, $g$ is continuous and with continuous derivative on all $[x_1,x_2]$ segments of the real line. So Lagrange mean value theorem applies. $\forall x_1,x_2 \in \mathbb R \exists c \in \mathbb R: g(x_1)-g(x_2)=g'(x)(x_1-x_2)$ If we add modules we get $|g(x_1)-g(x_2)| = |g'(c)||x_1-x_2| \leq |1-\frac{c}{d}||x_1-x_2|$ And so we have for all $x_1,x_2:$ $|g(x_1)-g(x_2)| \leq |1-\frac{c}{d}||x_1-x_2|$, which means $g$ is a contraction. So from Banach Fixed Point Theorem, $g$ admits a unique fixed point $g(x_0)=x_0$. The problem is: $g(x_0)=x_0$ does not imply that $f(x_0)=0$. Sure, it admits a fixed point but that does not help us prove that $f$ has a unique zero. if $g(x) = f(x)+x$ then that would have solved our problem, but no such luck.

Prove that there isn't a sequence of continuous function on $[0,1]$ that converges pointwise to the function $f$ on $[0,1]$ defined by $f(x)=0$ if $x$ is rational and $f(x)=1$ if $x$ is irrational. What I've tried: By contradiction: Suppose that indeed exists one(say $f_n$) and let's take $a$ in $[0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q}$, then $f_n(a)$ approaches to $0$ when $n$ is sufficiently large, say $n\ge N$. Let's take in particular $n=N$. Since $f_N$ is continuous, there exists a neighborhood of $a$, $(a-d,a+d)$, in which $f_N(x)$ is near $f_N(a)$, and thus is near to $0$. Let's take now $b$ irrational in that neighborhood. Then, for $n$ sufficiently large,say $n\ge K$, $f_n(b)$ is near $1$. This should be the contradiction, since $b$ would be at the same time near $0$ and $1$ (suppose I've chosen the right epsilons). The problem is that the $K$ may be larger than the $N$, and so there is no contradiction. If I then try to make the $N$ larger, then I modify the $d$, which modifies the $b$, and therefore there's no sense in taking that particular $b$. I've also tried to apply continuity to $f_k(x)$, but the neighborhood in which $f_k(x)$ is near $f_k(b)$ (which is near $1$) may not have anything in common with the previous neighborhood...

We can identify $E = k^n$ with $T_{Y,y}$. Let $f: X \to Y$ denote the closed immersion. Then we can identify $T_X,x$, the (Zariski) tangent space, with 
  $$\left\{ (t_1, \dots , t_n) \in E \mid \sum _{1 \le i \le n} \frac{\partial P }{\partial T_i} (x) t_i = 0, \forall P \in I \right\}$$. Now let's specialize to a particular example. With the identification above, I can see easily that $\dim T_{X,x_0} = 2$ since the differential is always zero and therefore, the above set is equal to $k^2$ (dimension 2). Now suppose $x \ne x_0$. Then the differential form is not zero so it seems that the above set should be equal to just the point $0 \in k^2$ which would have dimension 0, not 1. Can someone resolve this conflict? Finally, I have computed, or at least attempted to compute, the dimension of the Zariski tangent space via this identification, rather than attempting to compute the dimension of $m/m^2$.

The gradient is given by $(2x, 2y)$ and only vanishes at the origin. The differential equation describing the level sets is $\left(\frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}\right) = (−2y, 2x)$. The solutions are given by $q(t) = R(\cos(2 (t + p)) , \sin(2 (t + p)))$ where the constants $R$ and $p$ can be adjusted according to any given initial position. I am not able to get $q(t)$ the way the book gets it.  For example, for $x(t)$, instead of $R(\cos(2t))$ I get $R(2\cos t)$ after solving the differential equation. EDIT: Ok, so I think I have figured it out.  I think it was just a matter of choosing a parametrization.  My original choice was $x = r\cos t$, $y = r\sin t$, but I see now that if I use this then $\frac{dx}{dt} = -2y$ implies that $\frac{dx}{dt} = -2r\sin t$, and then $x$ would be $2r\cos t$.  Likewise, $y$ would be $2r\sin t$.  But using this parametrization would not work, since $x^2 + y^2$ does not equal $r^2$ as needed (by equation of circle), rather it would equal $4r^2$.  So I assume that the author just chose a parametrization to work in the equation, and simply that is where the solution comes from.

1590959,"Question about creating a volume form for $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$","This problem comes out of R.W.R. Darling (Differential Forms and Connections) ch.8. In the chapter he shows that if $M$ is an $n$-dimensional differential manifold immersed in $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$, and $\Psi$ is an immersion from $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ that parametrizes the manifold, and $f$ is a submersion from $\mathbb{R}^{n+k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $f^{-1}(0) = M$, then we can construct a volume form $(\star df)$ on $M$ using the Hodge star, and that $(\star df)\Lambda^n \Psi_{*}$, which parametrizes the volume form, is given for $k=1$, and $\Psi(0) = r$ by 
$$ \begin{vmatrix} D_1 f(r) & D_1 \Psi_1(0) & \cdots & D_n \Psi_1(0) \\
                         \vdots & \vdots      & \ddots & \vdots      \\
                         D_n f(r) & D_1 \Psi_n(0) & \cdots & D_n \Psi_n(0) \\
\end{vmatrix}. $$
The exercise is to do this with the submanifold $SL(2,\mathbb{R}) \subset GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ regarded as equivalent to $\mathbb{R}^{nxn}$, with $\Psi$ parametrizing $\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\ z & w \\ \end{pmatrix}$ as the image of $(x,y,z)$ and $f(x,y,z,w) = xw - yz - 1.$ I calculated this, and got: 
$$ \begin{vmatrix} w & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                  -z & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                  -y & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                   x & \frac{-w}{x} & \frac{z}{x} & \frac{y}{x} \\
\end{vmatrix}, $$
where $w = \frac{1+yz}{x}$, which correctly evaluates at $I$ to give $-2dx\land dy\land dz$ as the parametrized volume operator. The second part is where I have a problem, it says to extend this volume form in a left-invariant manner to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ by calculating $(L_A^{*}(\star df))(A^{-1})$, where $L_A$ is the left shift operator on $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$, with $L_A \begin{pmatrix} s & t \\ u & v \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x & y\\ z & w\\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} s & t \\ u & v \\ \end{pmatrix}$ when $A = \begin{pmatrix} x & y\\ z & w\\ \end{pmatrix}.$ I sense that I should take $(L_A^{*}(\star df)) = ((\star df)L_{A{*}})$ to start the process, but am confused as to how the push-forward fits into the calculation with respect to the parametrization $\Psi$.  Could someone help me with how that works? And do I calculate $L_{A{*}}$ as an element of $\mathbb{R}^{nxn}$ which gives a differential as a 4x4 matrix?

\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty\frac{\cos\pi\sqrt{n^2+1}}{3+4n^2}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\cos\pi\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}dx\ ? \tag{1}
$$ My analysis: Mathematica wasn't able to return any closed form for the integral or the sum. Then I checked this relation by numerical computations and it agreed to about 20 decimal places. I know from this question Sum equals integral that the function $\text{sinc}\ x=\frac{\sin x}{x}$ has the same property
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} {\rm sinc}\, x \, dx = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{+\infty} {\rm sinc}\, n = \pi
$$
I tried to find a closed form for the integral $(1)$ but couldn't. Motivation: I was challenged by a friend to prove this relation. I'm curious how one can prove it? Note: There has been a suggestion to straightforwardly apply Euler-MacLauren summation formula to prove this statement. Though I don't know why it can not be applied in this case, I checked numerically whether the sum equals the integral for the similar looking functions $f_1(x)=\frac{\cos\pi\sqrt{x^2+1}}{1+x^2}$ and $f_2(x)=\frac{\cos\pi\sqrt{x^2+1}}{2+x^2}$, but in both cases there was a difference of about 1% between the sum and the integral. In starck contrast to this, using the same algorithm for $\frac{\cos\pi\sqrt{x^2+1}}{3+4x^2}$ there wasn't any difference between the sum and the integral at least to 20 decimal places. So I think it is very unlikely that 1% error can be attributed to computational error.","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
