2764932,spectrum and point spectrum of $(Af)(x)=(2+\cos x)f(x)$,"Consider $A:L^2[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]\to L^2[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi} {2}]$ such that $(Af)(x)=(2+\cos x)f(x)$. Do we have $||A||\in \sigma(A)$ and $||A||\in\sigma_p(A)$? My attempt: I know that $||A||\in \sigma_p$ iff there exists a nonzero $f\in L^2[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ such that $Af=||A||f$. First, I showed that $A$ is selfadjoint. Then $$||Af||^2=\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}|(2+\cos x)f(x)|^2 dx \le \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}|3f(x)|^2 dx$$
This implies $||A||\le 3.$ Let $S_\epsilon=\{x\in [-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}] : 2+\cos x \ge 3-\epsilon\}$ and $f_\epsilon(x)=\mathbb{1}_{S_{\epsilon}}$. So, we can show that $||Af||\le (3-\epsilon)||f||$. This impiles $||A||=3$. If $||A||=3 \in \sigma_p$, then $Af=(2+\cos x)f(x)=3f(x)$ for some $f\in L^2[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$. How to prove or disprove such an $f$ exists? Can we just say the above equation implies $2+\cos x=f(x)$, which is a contradiction? How about $||A||\in \sigma(A)$? How to prove or disprove it?

2764976,Are these two cotangent bundles symplectomorphic?,"Let $T^{*}X$ be the cotangent bundle of $X$ and $\omega$ the tautological $2$-form.

Then, I do believe that $(T^{*}X,\omega)$ and $(T^{*}X,\omega_{\sigma})$ are not symplectomorphic. If $\sigma$ is exact, $\sigma=d\theta$, then $\theta(X)$ is a Lagrangian submanifold in $(T^{*}X,\omega_{\sigma})$. Then, if $\varphi$ were a symplectomorphism, $\varphi(\theta(X))=\{(\varphi(x),\varphi(\theta_{x}))\mid x\in X\}$ would be a Lagrangian submanifold of $(T^{*}X,\omega)$. I am trying to prove that this in not, in fact, a Lagrangian submanifold, but I do not know how to do it. Can anyone help me, please?
Thanks in advance. $\mathbf{EDIT}$: I think that by taking $f\colon (T^{*}X,\omega_{\sigma})\longrightarrow (T^{*}X,\omega)$ to be $f((x,\xi))=(x,\xi+\theta_{x}))$, $f$ is a symplectomorphism. I should prove that $f^{*}\alpha=\alpha+\pi^{*}\theta$ and I would be done. But does this hold?

2764985,Intuition for why the difference between $\frac{2x^2-x}{x^2-x+1}$ and $\frac{x-2}{x^2-x+1}$ is a constant?,"Why is the difference between these two functions a constant? $$f(x)=\frac{2x^2-x}{x^2-x+1}$$

Of course I can calculate it is true: the difference is $2$, but my intuition is still completely off here. So, who can provide some intuitive explanation of what is going on here? Perhaps using a graph of some kind that shows what's special in this particular case? Thanks! BACKGROUND: The background of this question is that I tried to find this integral: $$\int\frac{x dx}{(x^2-x+1)^2}$$ As a solution I found: $$\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\arctan\left(\frac{2x-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)+\frac{2x^2-x}{3\left(x^2-x+1\right)}+C$$ Whereas my calculusbook gave as the solution: $$\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\arctan\left(\frac{2x-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)+\frac{x-2}{3\left(x^2-x+1\right)}+C$$ I thought I made a mistake but as it turned out, their difference was constant, so both are valid solutions.",['algebra-precalculus']

2765146,A System of Simultaneous Pell Equations,"Are $0$ and $\pm1$ the only integer solutions for which both $\sqrt{24n^2+1}$ and $\sqrt{48n^2+1}$ are simultaneously integers ? Whilst pondering upon the Biblical concept of the Jubilee year , I couldn't help but notice that a time period of $7^2=49$ years, apart from approximating half of a decimal century of $10^2=100$ years, also lies conspicuously close to a third of a duodecimal “ century ” of $12^2=144$ years. In other words, I was left with solving the system of Diophantine equations $$\dfrac{x^2}3+1~=~y^2~=~\dfrac{z^2}2-1,$$ which, after a bit of basic number theory , boiled down to the system of Pell equations described above. Then, a Mathematica search of depth up to $10^4$ into the $($ periodic $)$ continued fraction expansion of $~\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{\dfrac{48n^2+1}{24n^2+1}}~=~\sqrt2~$ failed to reveal any other solutions, save for the ones mentioned earlier, implying that any other possible values of n possess at least $3,828$ digits.

2765167,Characterizing all non-integrally closed subrings of $\mathbb{C}[t]$,"P. M. Cohn proved the following: A subalgebra of $\mathbb{C}[t]$ is free if and only if it is integrally closed .
(Actually, Cohn's result deals with $k[t]$, $k$ any field, but I do not mind to take $k=\mathbb{C}$). Let $f=f(t),g=g(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$, with $\deg(f)>\deg(g)> 1$,
and consider $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$. For example: $f=t^3$, $g=t^2$, and then $\mathbb{C}[t^3,t^2] \subsetneq \mathbb{C}[t]$ is not integrally closed, since $t \in \mathbb{C}(t)=\mathbb{C}(t^3,t^2)$ is of course integral over $\mathbb{C}[t^3,t^2]$ ($t$ is a root of $T^2-t^2$, and $t$ is also a root of $T^3-t^3$) but $t \notin \mathbb{C}[t^3,t^2]$. Is it possible to characterize all (non-)integrally closed subrings of $\mathbb{C}[t]$ of the form $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ as above? It would be nice if it is possible to find a general form of $f$ and $g$ in terms of their coefficients and degrees, so denote:
$f=a_nt^n+\cdots+a_1t+a_0$ and $g=b_mt^m+\cdots+b_1t+b_0$,
where $n > m > 1$ and $a_i,b_i \in \mathbb{C}$. What about characterizing all free subrings $F$ of $\mathbb{C}[t]$ generated by two elements? (see remark (2) below; I wish to exclude $\mathbb{C}[t^4,t^2]$). If the field of fractions of a free $2$-generated subring $F$ equals $\mathbb{C}(t)$ is necessarily $F=\mathbb{C}[t]$? Remarks: (1) The assumption $m>1$ excludes the case $g=b_1t+b_0$ and then $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$, so it is integrally closed. (2) I think that I better further assume that the field of fractions of $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ equals $\mathbb{C}(t)$, in order to exclude cases such as $f=t^4, g=t^2$, which I am not interested in. (3) Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki theorem says that if $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ then $m$ divides $n$. Therefore, if $m$ does not divide $n$, then $\mathbb{C}[f,g] \subsetneq \mathbb{C}[t]$; in this case, is it still possible for $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ to be integrally closed, under the further assumption that $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(t)$? (4) If $\mathbb{C}[f,g] \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ is flat and $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(t)$, then $\mathbb{C}[f,g]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ and we are done (= $\mathbb{C}[f,g]$ is integrally closed). This follows from the second answer to this question (trivially, $\mathbb{C}[f,g] \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ is integral). Is there a criterion for flatness in terms of the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ and their degrees?

2765287,"Does $e^A=e^B$ imply $[A,B]=0$?","Let $A$ and $B$ be two matrices, and suppose that $\exp(A)=\exp(B)$. Does this imply that $[A, B]=0$? BCH 's formula shows a clear relation between $\exp(A)\exp(-B)$ and $[A, B]$, but the implication is far from obvious.
However, I haven't been able to find a counterexample for this fact.
Is this a known result? While, as was pointed out in one answer , this is not true in the general case, or even in the case where we restrict ourselves to diagonalizable matrices, the argument below (*) leads me to think that it may be true when restricting to normal matrices (that is, to unitarily diagonalizable ones). Is this argument correct? Is this a known result, and/or can it be shown in a more direct way? (*) $U$ is diagonalizable and non-degenerate. If $U$ is diagonalizable and non-degenerate, then we can write
$$U=\sum_{k=1}^N \lambda_k P_k,$$
where $\lambda_k$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ and $P_k$ projectors over the corresponding eigenvectors.
If $U$ to be normal, we also have $P_j P_k=\delta_{jk}$.
Then I can write the set of logarithms of $U$ as:
$$\log U = \sum_{k=1}^N (\operatorname{Log}\lambda_k+2\pi i\nu_k)P_k$$
with $\nu_k\in\mathbb Z$.
From the above, it seems that indeed all logarithms of $U$ must commute with each other (because trivially $[P_j, P_k]=0$). $U$ diagonalizable and possibly degenerate. If $U$ is diagonalizable but non necessarily non-degenerate, we can write it as
$$U=\sum_k\lambda_k\sum_{j=1}^{d_k}P_{kj},$$
where $d_k$ is the dimension of the $k$-th degenerate eigenspace, $\sum_j P_{kj}=P_k$, $\sum_k P_k=\mathbb 1$, $P_{ij}P_{kl}=\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}$, and it is to be noted that one can choose any such basis of projectors for each degenerate eigenspace.
The logarithms of $U$ are then written as
$$
\log U = \sum_{jk} \ell_{\nu_{k}}(\lambda_j) P_{jk},
$$
where we used the notation $\ell_j(\lambda)\equiv\operatorname{Log}(\lambda)+2\pi i j$ to denote the set of logarithms of a given $\lambda$.
The set of logarithms of $U$ is then characterised by the possible choices of $\{\nu_k\}_k$ and $P_{jk}$.","['matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrix-exponential']"

What can we say about 'being Galois' for extensions $F \subset G$ and $G \subset E$? I think for $G \subset E$ the answer is that it is Galois.  To show Galois I need to show normal and separable.  I have a theorem that says it will be normal so all thats left is to show it is separable.  $F \subset E$ being separable means the irreducible polynomial of any element $u \in E$ over has no multiple roots in any further extension of $E$, but I'm not sure how this means any polynomial over $G$ would also have no multiple roots. For $F \subset G$ I'm not even sure what the answer is.  I thought no, but I see something later in my notes that makes me think it is.  I don't know how to show normal, but for separability I have: The extension of $E$ over $F$ being separable means the irreducible polynomial of any element $u \in E$ over has no multiple roots in any further extension of $E$.

$$\mathbf{R} = \begin{pmatrix}a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\

$$i\mathbf{k}\times\tilde{\mathbf{B}}=\mathbf{R}\left(i\mathbf{k}\times\tilde{\mathbf{A}}\right)$$
which is a nice expression involving just vectors and not nasty partial derivatives. Now, I can rewrite this as

2765749,"Triple integral between spheres $\iiint \sin (xy) - \sin (xz) + \sin (yz) \,dx \,dy \,dz$","I'm hoping someone can tell me if this seems like a legitimate argument. Problem: compute $I:=\iiint_E \sin (xy) - \sin (xz) + \sin (yz) \,dx \,dy \,dz$ where $E = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : 1 \le x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 4 \}$. Claim: $I = 0$. First we split it up $I = \iiint_E \sin (xy)  \,dx \,dy \,dz - \iiint_E  \sin (xz)  \,dx \,dy \,dz + \iiint_E \sin (yz) \,dx \,dy \,dz$.  Let's examine just the first of these three: we show $\iiint_E \sin (xy)  \,dx \,dy \,dz =0$.  The key is to decompose the region $E$ and exploit symmetry.  $E$ can be decomposed into several ""pieces:"" let $E_{x=0} = \{ (x,y,z) \in E : x = 0 \}$ $E_{y=0} =\{(x,y,z) \in E : y = 0\}$ $E_{++} = \{ (x,y,z) \in E : x,y >0 \}$ $E_{-+} = \{(x,y,z) \in E : x <0 , y >0 \}$ $E_{+-} = \{(x,y,z) \in E : x >0 , y <0 \}$ $E_{--} = \{(x,y,z) \in E : x <0 , y <0 \}$ and the union of the above is precisely $E$.  We establish a bijection between $E_{++}$ and $E_{-+}$ so that the values of the integrand at corresponding points differ by $-1$: given $(a,b,z) \in E_{++}$ so that $a,b >0$ we associate the point $(-a,b,z) \in E_{-+}$ and this defines a bijection.  Furthermore $\sin (ab) = - \sin (-ab)$ because $\sin$ is odd.  Thus $\sin (ab) + \sin (-ab) = 0$.  We establish a bijection between $E_{+-}$ and $E_{--}$ with the same feature by sending $(a,-b,z) \in E_{+-}$ to $(-a,-b,z)\in E_{--}$.  We note that on $E_{x=0}$ and $E_{y=0}$ the integrand $\sin(xy)$ is $0$.  All of this together shows that $\iiint_E \sin (xy)  \,dx \,dy \,dz =0$. Symmetric arguments show that the other two integrals are $0$, although the subdivisions into pieces will be oriented differently. Therefore $I=0$. Does this seem correct?  I really hope so, because otherwise I have no idea how to solve this problem.  Actually if someone is aware of another way I'd be interested to hear it.

Since $F$ is a symplectomorphism, we have that $L$ is also Lagrangian, so once we find $\sigma$, it will be closed (I already have the result ""${\rm Im}\,\sigma$ is Lagrangian iff ${\rm d}\sigma = 0$""). So I'd guess that it suffices to show that $L$ intersect each cotangent space to $M$ exactly once. But it is not clear to me that if $x \in M$, then $F(x,\varphi(x)) \in T_x^*M$. The $C^1$-close to the zero section I guess it is automatic, in some sense, since $L\subseteq U_0$ (it was never made clear what exactly is meant by ""$C^1$-close"", although one can guess). I'd like some help filling up these details, and to be sure nothing I said so far is wrong. Thanks!","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

First of all A can be diagonalized so is $diag(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n)$ in some basis. If $\lambda$ is its eigenvalue, then $\lambda^{m} = 1$. The minimal polynomial $p$ for A divides $x^m - 1$ and belongs to $\mathbb Z[x]$ because $A \in Mat(\mathbb Z)$. Actually $p(\lambda_i) = 0$. So this should give some limitations on $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n)$. I need to get all possible cases for $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n)$.

I believe it is consistent that $\mathbb{R}^{\omega_1}$ is sequential, it depends on your set theory.

For a function $\hat{v} \in C^2(\hat{K})$, we define the corresponding function $v \in C^2(K)$ by
$$
   v(x) = (\hat{v}\circ F^{-1})(x).
$$ I am interested in giving a bound for the Sobolev semi-norm $|v|_{2, K}$ in terms of $|\hat{v}|_{2, \hat{K}}$ and the matrix $B$. I use the definitions $$
|v|_{2, K} = \left(\int_{K} \sum_{|\alpha| = 2} |\partial^\alpha v(x)|^2 dx \right)^{1/2}
$$
where $\partial^\alpha v$ is the the mixed partial derivatives of order $|\alpha| = 2$. What I have tried I started by trying to bound $|\partial^\alpha v(x)|$ in terms of the directional derivatives $$
   |\partial^\alpha v(x)| \leq \sup_{\|\xi_1\|, \|\xi_2\| \leq 1} |\nabla ((\nabla v(x))\cdot \xi_1)\cdot \xi_2)|

and then use that since $v(x) = \hat{v}(\hat{x})$ this equals $$
   |\partial^\alpha v(x)| \leq \sup_{\|\xi_1\|, \|\xi_2\| \leq 1} |\nabla ((\nabla v(x))\cdot \xi_1)\cdot \xi_2)| \\
 = \sup_{\|\xi_1\|, \|\xi_2\| \leq 1} |\nabla ((\nabla v(x))\cdot B^{-1}\xi_1)\cdot B^{-1}\xi_2)| \\

This question explains it for scalar-valued functions as $$f(x)\nabla_x g(x)+g(x)\nabla_x f(x).$$ However things don't have the correct dimensions when I plug in the values in the above, namely. As Travis wrote in the comment below, we should have: $$ \nabla_x(x^TAx) = (\nabla_x x^T)Ax + x^T\nabla_x(Ax) $$ however that still leaves you with at least an $x$ in the first expression and an $x^T$ in the second. I don't see how that can conform and how it leaves you with $(A + A^T)x$ or $x^T(A + A^T)$ This question is essentially asking the same thing, but the answer doesn't really involve the product rule above. I figure there must be some general formula to apply, as with scalar-valued functions. Am I writing the product rule correctly in this case? Is there somethign I'm missing or doing incorrectly? EDIT: Building off of Algabraic Pavel's answer... I think the problem is that you have to formulate the functions $f(x)$ and $f(x)$ so their in the same space. That is, for $f,g:\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^M$ , the product rule is: $$\nabla_x (f(x)^Tg(x)) = f(x)^T\nabla_x g(x) + g(x)^T \nabla f(x)$$ So in the example above, if we let $f(x) = x$ , $g(x)=Ax$ , then the formula holds. As another example, consider $$Axx^T$$ and let $f(x) = x^T A^T$ and $g(x) = x^T$ . We have both $f,g:\mathbb{R}^{Nx1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{1xN}$ and $$\nabla_x (f(x)^Tg(x)) = \nabla_x (Axx^T) = Ax + xA^T$$ which holds, notice that if we made $f(x) = Ax$ and not $f(x) = (Ax)^T$ , the rule falls apart.

Let $T : \ell^p \to \Bbb{R}$ be a bounded linear functional, and let $q$ be the conjugate of $p$. Let $e_n$ denote the vector with a $1$ in the $n$-th coordinate and $0$'s elsewhere; and let $b_n = T(e_n)$, which makes since $e_n \in \ell^p$. Then given $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty \in \ell^p$, \begin{align}
T(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty &= T(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n e_n) \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n T(e_n) \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n b_n, \\

Well, $c_n = |b_n|^{q-1} sgn(b_n)$ appears to work: \begin{align}

&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |b_n|^{q-1} sgn(b_n)b_n \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |b_n|^q \\

Sadly, this amounts to showing that $\sum_{n=N}^\infty |b_n|^q \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$; and unfortunately, this does not converge to $0$, unless converges the series itself converges, which I initially and mistakenly thought was true.

2766638,Looking for a better way to solve this system of equations.....,"The Question : Solve for real $x, y$ : $$xy^2 = 15x^2 + 17xy + 15y^2$$ 
$$x^2y= 20x^2 + 3y^2$$ My initial attempts involved adding and subtracting the two equations, eliminating one variable, completing some squares and so on. But there was no significant progress as I soon reached a dead end. The way I was actually able to solve this problem was somewhat unusual : I divided the equations to get $\frac {y}{x} = \frac{15x^2 +17xy + 15y^2}{20x^2 + 3y^2}$.  Seemed a very hopeless start, but soon I realised that I could divide the numerator and denominator by $x^2$ on Right Hand Side of the equation, which allowed me to substitute $\frac {y}x= m$. Clearing the denominator, I obtained a cubic equation in $m$ which factored as $(m^2+1)(m-5)=0$. As $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, I rejected the $m^2 +1 = 0$ possibility and got $m=5$ and hence $y = 5x$. After using this relation, I finally got the ordered pair $(x,y) \equiv (19,95)$ as the solution. I feel that my method is very ""robotic"" and unnecessarily complicated. Is there any shorter, better, or more elegant way of solving this problem ? I am unable to find any other approach. Thanks in advance.","['algebra-precalculus', 'systems-of-equations']"

Some useful references can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etemadi%27s_inequalityhte and PSQ Maximal inequality for a sequence of partial sums of independent random variables . It is easy to check $\Longleftarrow$. Unfortunately, for checking $\Longrightarrow$, I am struggle in how to use the inequality to prove the problem. As what I have learned, I only know a.s. convergence implies convergence in P. In addition, if the sequence $Y_n$ converges in P, then there must exists a subsequence ${Y_{n_k}}$ converges a.s. But the problem mentions that converges in P implies converge a.s. I am a little bit shocking. My try: Suppose we $\sum^{\infty}_{i=1}X_i$ converges in probability, then I took limit in BHS for the inequality, that is .
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P(\sup_{n\ge1}|S_n|>3\epsilon) \le \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}3\sup_{n\ge1}P(|S_n|>\epsilon)$$

What I did was to show the matrix is similar to a matrix with a diagonal matrix with distinct complex numbers, and now if $A$ is such a matrix and $B$ is a square root. Then $B$ is diagonalizable so since $A$ and $B$ commute there is a matrix $P$ such that that $P^{-1}BP$ and $P^{-1}AP$ are both are diagonal. So my argument was that to consider the diagonal case (w.l.g) and show that each diagonal entry of $P^{-1}BP$ should be root of the corresponding diganoal entry of $P^{-1}AP$. So we can have atmost 2 options for each and overall we get $2^n$. Now the problem I just realized is that I just saw that for any invertible  diagonalizable matrix $A^2$, $A$ is also diagonalizable. So then we can apply the same logic as what I just did to any such invertible matrix. But I also know the identity has infinitely many roots. So where did I go wrong?

2766802,"Intuition for $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ in terms of its infinite expansion","To gain deeper insight to the Poisson and exponential random variables, I found that I could derive the random variables as follows: I consider an experiment which consists of a continuum of trials on an interval $[0,t)$. The result of the experiment takes the form of an ordered $n$-tuple $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ containing distinct points on the interval. Every outcome is equally likely and I measure the size of the set containing tuples of $n$ different points by $I_n$ as: $$ I_n = \int_0^{t}  \int_0^{x_{n}} \int_0^{x_{n-1}} \cdots \int_0^{ x_2 } dx_1 dx_{2} dx_{3} \dots dx_{n-1} dx_{n} = \frac{ t^n } { n! }$$ It follows that on some interval, $[0,t)$, the probability that the experiment results in an $k$-tuple, $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is $$P(X(t) = k) = \frac{I_k}{\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} I_n} = \frac{e^{-t} t^k}{k!}$$ And for $k = 0$, we have $P(X(t) = 0) = e^{-t}$. Question: I was wondering if some similar intuition can applied to derive the Gaussian: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp \big(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \big)
\ \text{ or the standard normal, }\  \frac{e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi}}$$ I think that such an intuition might be obtained by gaining more insight into each term in the expansion of $\text{erf}(x)$ as is done for Poisson:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{erf}(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt \pi } \int_{-x}^{x} e^{-t^2} dt\\
&= \frac{2}{\sqrt \pi } \big( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{ x^{2n+1} }{ n! (2n+1) } \big)^{-1}

2766806,Integral over a surface in 4-dimensions,"Consider the integral of a function $f(x,y,z)$ over a surface embedded in 3 dimensions. 
The surface has a parameterization:
$$g(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)) $$
The integral is given by: $$ \iint_{u,v}f(g(u,v))\|\vec{g}_u \times \vec{g}_v\|\,dudv$$ In words, you are placing a curvilinear coordinate system over the surface (a ""form-fitting"" coordinate system to the surface). You use these curvilinear grid lines to tile the surface with parallelogram area elements. These parallelograms are actually linear approximations to the curvilinear area elements. Question Consider a surface integral of a function $f(x,y,z,w)$ over a surface embedded in 4 dimensions. The surface has a parameterization:
$$ g(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v), w(u,v)) $$ The integral is given by
$$ \iint_{u,v} f(g(u,v))(\;\;\;\;)dudv$$
I can embedded parallelograms in 4 dimensions. However my question is, what is the notation used for the linear approximation? The cross product doesn't work in 4-dimensions. So I was wondering if I should go back to something more geometric: $A = bh$. The two side lengths of an infinitesimal parallelogram are given by $\|\vec{g}_u\|du$ and $\|\vec{g}_v\|dv$. The angle between them is given by $$ \theta = \arccos\Big(\frac{\vec{g}_udu \cdot \vec{g}_vdv}{\|\vec{g}_u\|du\|\vec{g}_v\|dv}\Big) \\
\theta = \arccos\Big(\frac{\vec{g}_u \cdot \vec{g}_v}{\|\vec{g}_u\|\|\vec{g}_v\|}\Big)
$$
And therefore my integral becomes $$ \iint_{u,v} f(g(u,v)) \|\vec{g}_u\|\|\vec{g}_v\|\sin(\arccos\Big(\frac{\vec{g}_u \cdot \vec{g}_v}{\|\vec{g}_u\|\|\vec{g}_v\|}\Big)) \,dudv$$ Is this even correct?

If $A$ has finite order then the trace of its inverse is the conjugate of its trace. I know two proofs of this fact, but they both require linear algebra facts whose proofs are themselves quite involved. Since $A^n=I$, the eigenvalues of $A$ are roots of unity. Hence they have unit norm, and so their reciprocals are their conjugates. Then the result follows from following facts: (a) The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $A$, (b) the dimensions of the eigenspaces of $A^{-1}$ are equal to the dimensions of the corresponding eigenspaces of $A$, (c) the trace is equal to the sum of the (generalised) eigenvalues. The proof of (a) is relatively easy, but (b) and (c) seem to require the existence of Jordan Normal Form, which requires a lot of work. By Weyl's Unitary Trick , there's a inner product for which $A$ is unitary (this proof is itself a fair amount of work). So in an orthonormal basis (which we must construct with the Gram-Schmidt procedure) the inverse of $A$ is given by its conjugate transpose (one must also prove this). So the trace of the inverse is the conjugate of the trace.

If simplices only deal with numbers like $\mathbb{R}$ (""the standard n-simplex (or unit n-simplex) is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$""), or if there are simplices where the vectors can be arbitrary non-numerical data like in graph theory. Or is what I am thinking of CW-complexes , which seem to be a generalization of simplices. If the topological ball is an example of simplices without numbers . Topologically a simplex is equivalent to a ball. A ball can be defined for a metric space, or even a topological space, which means it can be defined without numbers. These relate to CW-complexes . The reasons for these questions are because I learned recently that a 0-dimensional simplex can be thought of as a vertex in a graph , and a 1-dimensional simplex can be thought of as an edge . An edge is essentially 2 vertices in the simplex. It is 2 things . But the thing is, an edge is a line connecting two vertices in graph theory, so in essence it is 3 things in graph theory: 2 vertices and 1 line. The line/edge can have it's own data or state. It seems the graph-theory vertices/edges are slightly different than the simplex defined vertices/edges. I understand why you can call a 1-dimensional simplex an edge, because it is essentially the data of two vertices (and that's it). But it's always drawn as a line connecting two points. Which got me wondering... In terms of visualization, 2-dimensional simplices are drawn as triangles, and 3-dimensional as tetrahedron. Are they really triangles and tetrahedrons, or are they really just 3 and 4 sets of points. And for n-dimensional simplexes, they are n+1 collections of points. And in this way, they are like vectors, where each vector is a set of points. So simplexes are basically vectors (with I guess extra limitations about how they can connect). Wondering what I am missing. From wikipedia : A simplex may be defined as the smallest convex set containing the given vertices. A regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope. Topologically, an n-simplex is equivalent to an n-ball. Every n-simplex is an n-dimensional manifold with corners. And the mathematical definition of a simplex is: $$C=\left\{\theta _{0}u_{0}+\dots +\theta _{k}u_{k}~{\bigg |}~\sum _{i=0}^{k}\theta _{i}=1{\mbox{ and }}\theta _{i}\geq 0{\mbox{ for all }}i\right\}$$ This definition seems to say they are only about numbers, but maybe addition could be defined abstractly without numbers, which would agree with the abstract topological definition, not sure.","['graph-theory', 'general-topology', 'simplicial-stuff']"
