39288,How to apply Stokes' Theorem for manifolds with boundary,"Original motivation: How can I apply Stokes' Theorem to the annulus $1 < r < 2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$? Concerns: Since the annulus is a manifold without boundary, it would seem that Stokes' Theorem would always return an answer of $\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega = 0$ for compactly supported forms $\omega$.  Is this correct? What about the annulus $1 < r \leq 2$?  This seems like a manifold-with-boundary to me, yet an application of Stokes' Theorem will return a different answer.  And what about $1 \leq r \leq 2$? For instance, consider $\omega = -y\,dx + x\,dy$ on the annulus $1 < r \leq 2$, so that $d\omega = 2\,dx\,dy$.  Then $$\int_M d\omega = 2\,\text{Area}(M) = 6\pi,$$
whereas $$\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_0^{2\pi} 4\,dt = 8\pi,$$
where $\partial M$ is the circle $r = 2$. What explains this discrepancy? A friend of mine has suggested that this can be explained by the fact that $\omega = -y\,dx + x\,dy$ is not compactly supported on $1 < r \leq 2$, and hence Stokes' Theorem can't really be applied.  Is this correct? For reference, I am using the following version of the theorem: Stokes' Theorem: Let $M$ be a smooth, oriented $n$-manifold with boundary, and let $\omega$ be a compactly supported smooth $(n-1)$-form on $M$.  Then $$\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.$$","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
39299,"Are rotations of $(0,1)$ by $n \arccos(\frac{1}{3})$ dense in the unit circle?","Under which conditions will successive rotations of $(0, 1)$ by an angle $\theta$ guarantee that given $\delta > 0$ and some point $p$ on the unit circle, there exists some $n$ such that rotating $(0, 1)$ by $n\theta$ yields a point within $\delta$ radians of $p$?  That is, are there certain angles that will guarantee that the set generated by rotating $(0, 1)$ by integral multiples of $\theta$ is dense in the unit circle? More specifically, I am working with the angle $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)$ and wish to show that this property is true, but I'm not sure how to go about proving this.  It seems likely I'm missing something simple here...  Does it hold for any angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$?  If so, why?","['geometry', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
39300,How to define a topological tunnel?,"I would like to define a notion of a topological tunnel , but I don't know how
(or even if it is possible) to capture it topologically.
I am interested in closed 2-manifolds in $\mathbb{R^3}$.
Suppose you have a solid block of material, and you drill a hole
in it.  The hole is like a tube or tunnel, it enters at one spot, exits at another,
and in between can take any path (even knotted) that does not self-intersect or touch the surface until the tunnel exits.  Now drill another such tunnel, same rules, but now it cannot intersect or touch the previous tunnel, but it may weave around it.  Etc.
The shape of the tunnel is irrelevant, but I want it to be independent of others. I don't think genus captures this notion of a tunnel.  For example, holes shaped like
the letter 'Y', or the letter 'H', can never occur with my tunnels.  Is there a concept used in topology that corresponds to these tunnels?
If not, can you see how to unambiguously define a tunnel? Thanks for any help!","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'manifolds']"
39305,How to optimize a rational function,"Just a calculus problem: As a function of $K \geq 1$, what is the minimum value of $f/a + f/b + f/c + f/d + f/e$ subject to the following constraints? $$\begin{cases} 1 \leq a \leq c \\ 1 \leq b \leq c \\ 1 \leq d \\ 1 \leq e \\ f = \frac{a^2 b^2 d e}{c} \\ f = K \end{cases}$$ I am fine with a reasonably detailed ""here is how you do this calculus"" answer, or ""here is how to ask wolfram alpha/maple"" answer (that works).  I need to be able to handle variations (the formula for f is always a ""monomial"" but the powers on the variables can change, and the inequalities amongst the $a,b,c,d,e$ variables might change slightly, though all of them are always at least 1). A version I can do: As a function of K ≥ 1, find the minimum value of $f/a + f/b + f/c + f/d + f/e$ subject to the following constraints: $$\begin{cases} 1 \leq a,b,c,d,e \\ f = abcde \\ f = K \end{cases}$$ This version is highly symmetric and I basically understand the region I am optimizing over. Setting any variable to 1 results in a highly non-optimal solution, so the minimum occurs in the middle of the surface where abcde = K , and so the gradient of the objective function is a scalar multiple of the normal to the surface.  Both are very symmetric and the algebra involved in solving them is almost silly.  The answer is the expected $a=b=c=d=e=K^{1/5}$ due to symmetry. Motivation : In the background, $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are all positive odd integers describing the structure of an unknown group.  In the previous incarnations of this problem, I assumed they were real numbers bounded below by 1, and the calculus minimum was in fact the group theory minimum. On the new problem, I asked maple to give the unconstrained (except for the "" f ="" constraints) problem a shot, and it claims there is only one local extrema, and it involves a lot of negative numbers.  I guess that means the minimum is at a ""corner"" (discontinuity of the function defining the boundary of the feasible region), but I have no idea what that means in more than 2 dimensions, and I am a little nervous that such an answer is wrong, at least from the group theory standpoint.","['nonlinear-optimization', 'multivariable-calculus']"
39313,Setting up and solving differential equation with The Euler Method,"I recently started this question and it gave me some insight into the world of differential equations. However the solution was not fit for my goals as I wanted a general method for calculating the position of a particle travelling through a vector field where the vectors in the field represents a force pushing on the particle. So this is kind of a follow-up from the information I got from my other question. So what do I have? A vector field that is defined by a function: $\vec{F}(x,y)$ I have left out the definition of the function since I wish to find a solution that works regardless off the function definition. But one example could be:
$\vec{F}(x,y) = (\sin(x),\cos(y))$ A particle, which have some initial values for position and velocity $\vec{p}(0)=P$ $\dot{\vec{p}}(0)=Q$ I know wish to find the position of the particle after a specified time $\vec{P}(t)$ and velocity $\dot{\vec{P}}(t)$. From what I learned from the other question it's not possible to find a closed form solution to this, but you have to use some approximation with for example Euler's Method. However I don't know how to model this scenario as a differential equation and how to apply Euler's Method (or any other approximation technique) to my scenario. If someone could, step by step explain this process it would be much appreciated! I should also add, the goal is to implement this in a program, so keep that in mind! Thanks! P.S.

39369,A question about $\prod_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{*}}{x}$,"When I was an elementary school student, I encountered some puzzles like ""What's product of numbers of hair of each people in the world?"", which answer was zero, because there's people with no hair(bald), and 0*any number = 0. There was similar question like ""What's the product of every number in a telephone?"". After know that '0' makes the whole answer 0, I made three questions and asked first two questions to my friends (to induce the last question): ""What's the product of every numbers ?"" (or $\prod_{x\in \mathbb{R}} x = ?$) ""What's the sum of every numbers ?"" (or $\sum_{x\in \mathbb{R}} x = ?$) They answered '0' in the first question easily, and they also answered '0' in the second question, though they spent several seconds to think (that $x+(-x) = 0$). After they answered the second question, I asked the last question: ""The answer of the first question was zero, because 'every numbers' includes zero. Then, what's the product of every numbers, except zero ? (or $\prod_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{*}} x = ?$)"" My answer was -1, because except 1 and -1, every number $x$ has it's inverse, $\frac{1}{x}$, and the product of two numbers is 1. Therefore, the answer = 1*-1*1*1*.... = -1. It was quite interesting, because some answered 'infinite?', some answered '1', and some answered '-1', which was the correct answer I thought, before one of my friend says that ""Because the set of real numbers are uncountable, your question doesn't have an answer."" I don't remember whether my friend said ""doesn't have an answer"", ""'s answer is infinite"", or other things... Anyway, the question is, what is the answer of $\prod_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{*}} x$? is it -1? or undecidable? If it's not -1 (undecidable or infinite or others), then what's the answer of above two questions? or $\prod_{x\in \mathbb{Q}^{*}} x$? If it's 1, then what's the answer in hyperreal number?","['sequences-and-series', 'products']"

39378,Series of logarithms $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \ln(k)$ (Ramanujan summation?),"I had this question earlier, so to say as a ""standalone"" problem, but now it pops up in context of an analysis with the lngamma -function. As well as we can convert the question of sums of like powers $Su_p(n)=1^p+2^p+3^p+\cdots+n^p$ in terms of the Hurwitz-zeta $Su_p(n) = \zeta(p,1)-\zeta(p,n+1)$ (and solve using the Bernoulli-polynomials) I try to express this for sums of logarithms (and powers of logarithms) : $$ Sl_p(n) = \ln(1)^p+\ln(2)^p+\cdots+\ln(n)^p $$ I have seemingly proper coefficients for power series which allow that computations/approximations. The result is always found by the difference of $ Sl_p(n)-Sl_p(1) $ . Here the power series has zero as constant term. However, to have the analogue to the Hurwitz-zeta I should have the constant term the ""value"" for the infinite sum $ Sl_p(\infty) $ instead. (This cancels properly if I formulate the sum of (powers of) logarithms always as that difference $ Sl_p(n)-Sl_p(1) $) And also, I'd like that this agreed conceptually more to the notion:
$$ \begin{array} {rll} Sl_p(n)-Sl_p(1) &=& T_p(0)-T_p(n) \\\
 & =&  (\ln(1)+\ln(2)+\ln(3)+\cdots) \\\ 
 & & - (\ln(n+1)+\ln(n+2)+\ln(n+2)+\cdots) \end{array} $$ as this agrees more with the idea of the Hurwitz-zeta-difference. But this requires, that $T_p(0)$ represents the (infinite) sum of the $p$'th powers of the logarithms, and the constant in the power series of $T_p(0)$ must contain just such a value. Let's talk about the first powers of the logs $p=1 $ first and denote the assumed sum as $L_1$ : $ L_1 = \lim_{n\to \infty} T_1(0) $ [update 2] I think, thanks to the hint of J.M., I can answer Q1 myself now; only Q2 remains somehow vague - besides a simple empirical heuristic I did still not get the formally correct approach to the constant term/integral-definition in the Ramanujan summation - but this is now only a side problem here (however it would be nice to get help also for this question). With the help of the knowledge about the derivatives of the zeta at zero the relevant part of the problem could now satisfyingly be solved, so I put it here in an answer to my own question, see that answer below.... Final remark/conclusion: it is interesting, that the power series for the lngamma pops up here ""automatically"" - we need no other uniqueness criterion for the argument, that the (Eulerian) gamma-function gives ""the correct"" interpolation for the factorial problem. It is just the result of the construction of an operator for the ""indefinite summation"" (which was the comceptual goal from where the problem/question arose initially) In the following I keep the rest of the original question although the approach to the Ramanujan summation contains an error [end Update 2] I tried to give sense to that divergent series by replacing the powers of $x$ in the Mercator series for $ \ln(1+x) $ by appropriate zetas at negative integer arguments. If I understand things correctly then this is similar to the method of Ramanujan summation, where the Bernoulli numbers are just replaced by the according zeta-values (appropriately scaled). With this I got then an approximation of $$L_1 \approx -0.0810614667953 $$ which seems a rather ""random"" value... By searching in other online sources I got the suggestion ( OEIS ), that this is also $$ \int_1^2 \ln(\Gamma(t)) \; dt \approx -0.08106146679532725821967026 $$ With this my power series for $T_1(x)$ begins like $ \qquad \small \begin{array} {l}

$ The other coefficients occur also in the power series for $f(x)=\ln(\Gamma(\exp(x)) $ Also, $L_1$ seem to satisfy the following expression: 
$$ \exp(L_1) = {\sqrt{(2\pi)} \over e} \approx 0.9221370088957891168791517 $$ The questions are:
$\qquad$ Q1 : Is that value $-0.0801\ldots$ a meaningful (or even correct) representation for the infinite sum of logarithms? $\qquad$ Q2 : Did I reproduce the Ramanujan summation correctly here? [update 1] : J.M. mentions the relation to $ y= - \zeta'(0) \approx 0.918938533205 $ where the representation of the derivative of zeta at 0 equals formally just the sum of logarithms. Now my $L_1$ and the $y$ are related by $L_1 = y - 1$. So I expect some error in my derivation which leads just to that unit difference...","['special-functions', 'divergent-series', 'logarithms', 'sequences-and-series']"
39385,Non-homogeneous Differential Equation,"Trying to solve a non-homogeneous differential equation, whether it is linear, Bernoulli, Euler, you solve the related homogeneous equation and then you look for a particular solution depending on the ""class"" of the non-homogeneous term. Just to make an example, let's say we have this equation $$y'' - y' - 2y = 2x e^x$$ we solve $$y'' -2y' +y =0$$ and we get solutions of the form $y_{\text{hom}}(x) = C_1 e^{2x} + C_2 e^{-x}$. Then, since the known term is of the form $p(x)(x) e^{\mu x}$, and $\mu$ is not a solution to the characteristic polynomial, we should find the solutions through those of the form $q(x)e^{\mu x}$. If, on the other hand, $\mu$ were a solution of the characteristic polynomial, we should have looked for solutions through those of the form $q(x) x^q e^{\mu x}$ where $q$ is the multiplicity of the root $\mu$. (where $q(x)$ is the general polynomial of the same degree as $p(x)$. I have a whole list of these ""classes"" of known terms, like $p(x)$, $p(x)e^{\mu x}$, $e^{\alpha x}(a \sin(\beta x) + a' \cos(\beta x))$, and the corresponding general solutions (like I said before, also with the multiplicity involved). My question is, where do these come from? I have no idea how such classes were found or anything; my book and my professors just said these were given and we should just learn them.

39407,A question concerning polynomial solvable by radicals,"We know from Galois Theory that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable. On the other hand solvable by radicals for example means that the equation $X^n-1=0$ is always solvable by radicals (its Galois group is abelian), but this only means that we can find a solution by saying it is $1^{1/n}$, which is a radical. As for $n\le 6$ we can find its solution in the form $a+ib$ where $a,b$ are representable by real radicals. I guess this is not always possible for larger $n$.

My first inclination is to check all words of a given length (I think I can check all 8-element words easily, and maybe all 9- or 10-element words with a little effort) to see which ones move as few pieces as possible and then try and use that to understand more of the structure (for instance, I already know that there are elements of odd sign, so it's not a subgroup of $A_{16}$); above and beyond that, though, what tricks and techniques should I be aware of?  In particular, are there any good ways of finding useful/meaningful expressions of my group as some sort of wreath product, or of understanding its quotient in $S_{16}$ (assuming it's even normal!)?  I'm presuming that understanding $S_{16}/G$ will provide a sense of the constraints that any valid position has to satisfy... EDIT: For anyone who's curious enough and has better tools to play with it than I do, the four generators are the cycles: $\alpha = (1\quad 2\quad 3\quad 7\quad 11\quad 10\quad 9\quad 5)$ , $\beta = (2\quad 3\quad 4\quad 8\quad 12\quad 11\quad 10\quad 6)$, $\gamma = (5\quad 6\quad 7\quad 11\quad 15\quad 14\quad 13\quad 9)$, and $\delta = (6\quad 7\quad 8\quad 12\quad 16\quad 13\quad 14\quad 10)$.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn it's all of $S_{16}$, but that still leaves a lot of obviously-open questions from a puzzle perspective (minimal-length words to swap two elements and the like), and any good suggestions on ways of finding particular elements of the group (where to look for interesting commutators and conjugates, etc.) would be welcome; I have a little background from doing some basic Rubik's-Cube stuff (for instance, my first look was at the element $(\alpha^2\beta^2)^2$ ), but not much.","['gap', 'puzzle', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
39457,(Ir)reducibility criteria for homogeneous polynomials,"Suppose I have a homogeneous polynomial in at least 3 variables over some algebraically closed field (of characteristic 0, if need be). Question : How may I test — by hand — whether it is irreducible? I understand that there aren't even yet algorithms which can decide whether a univariate polynomial is irreducible, but nonetheless there are tools like the Eisenstein criterion, reduction modulo $p$, and Gauss's lemma which come in useful. Example : How can I show that $X^n + Y^n + Z^n$ is irreducible over a field of characteristic 0? The following argument works for $n$ a power of 2 and base field $\mathbb{Q}$: we know that $Y^n + Z^n$ is irreducible, since otherwise we could produce a $n$-th root of $-1$ in $\mathbb{Q}$. Thus $\mathfrak{p} = (Y^n + Z^n)$ is a prime ideal, and we can apply the generalised Eisenstein criterion. But this argument breaks down when $n$ is divisible by an odd number (because then we could factor out ($X^m + Y^m$, where $m$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $n$) or when there are $n$-th roots of $-1$. Alternatively, for $n = 2$, I can use an ad hoc approach: if $G(X, Y, Z) H(X, Y, Z) = X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2$, treating $Y$ and $Z$ as constants, we see that we must have a difference-of-squares factorisation, so we have $- (Y^2 + Z^2)$ a square, and iterating the argument, we see this cannot possibly be the case, even if the field is algebraically closed. That kind of trick works well when there aren't any cross terms, but what about, say, the polynomial $X^2 Y^3 + Y^2 Z^3 + Z^2 X^3$? Here I'm quite lost. If the base field is algebraically closed, then substituting constants for $Z$ don't yield anything useful, since the resulting polynomial is always reducible. While it remains true that the polynomial is irreducible if if I can find an ideal $\mathfrak{I}$ such that the polynomial modulo $\mathfrak{I}$ is irreducible, it's not obvious to me whether any such ideals exist or not. Context : Some of my exercises / exam problems ask me to show that a given hypersurface in projective space is irreducible. I'm not sure how much weight is placed on it, but it would be reassuring if I could do it properly.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

Here's what I've tried so far.  If $a_{n,k}$ is the number of elements of $S_n$ with $k$ fixed points, then we have that $$
a_{n,k}=\binom{n}{k}a_{n-k,0}

After computing $a_{n,0}$ by hand for small values of $n$, I was able to look up the recursion formula $a_n=na_{n-1}+(-1)^n$ from oeis.org.

39557,Derivative of numbers,"I am not talking here about deriving a constant in the usual sense (which gives $0$ as everyone knows). I have once heard of a derivative operator with relaxed conditions that was defined over the real numbers whose purpose at first was to study number theory. Usually, two of the essential properties that we demand on a differential operator is its linearity and its way of acting over products, i.e. if I call my differential operator $D$, : $$
D(f+g) = Df + Dg, \quad D(fg) = (Df)g + fDg.
$$ Let's suppose we delete the linearity condition and keep only the product rule. Define $D(1) = 0$, $D(p) = 1$ if $p$ is prime and suppose $D$ satisfies the product relation over products. It is quite unclear in my memory at which point this operator could do (i.e. on which things could we apply it, was it restricted to algebraic numbers, or could it go over any real, complex?) Between the two lines I'm detailing what I know about this operator. For instance, $D(4) = 2D(2) + 2(D(2)) = 2(1) + 2(1) = 4$. Hence $D(4) = 4$ is equal to its own derivative. Right now my definition only make sense with integers, since we can factor an integer $n$ in its prime decomposition and then apply the product rule to find the answer. We can also find the derivative of a fraction :
$$
0 = D(1) = D(q/q) = q D(1/q)  + 1/q D(q)  \quad \Rightarrow \quad D(1/q) = -\frac{D(q)}{q^2}.
$$
hence we can deduce the usual formula $D(p/q) = \frac{qD(p) - pD(q)}{q^2}$ by a similar argument. By an inductive argument, we can also show things as $D(a^n) = na^{n-1}$, and define this operator on algebraic numbers (at least for some that I know), for instance if $a$ is positive, 
$$
D(a) = a^{1/2} D(a^{1/2}) + a^{1/2} D(a^{1/2}) = 2a^{1/2} D(a^{1/2}), \quad \Rightarrow D(a^{1/2}) = \frac{D(a)}{2a^{1/2}}
$$
and note here the similarity for the formula for deriving the function $1/f(x)$ in the real differentiable functions system. If anyone has heard of such an operator over numbers which I have tried to describe as much as possible, can anyone tell me if there are any known results related to number theory that uses this tool to lead to some demonstrations that are useful?

39599,Can Egoroff's Theorem be Strengthened for A Sequence of Smooth Functions？,"I have posted this question on MO, and I'll raise the question here in a more concrete way. To simplify the situaton, we assume the measure space we are dealing with right now is a closed interval $I$ of the real line. When we are using the Egoroff's theorem, little attention has been paid to the exceptional set, i.e. the set $E\subset I$ on which $(f_n)$ fails to converge uniformly. The only thing we know about $E$ is that $m(E)$ can be arbitrary small. Taking the topology on the real line into account, we can also assume that $E$ is closed. Recall that in the proof of this theorem, we constructed the exceptional set $E_{\varepsilon}$ with respect to a fixed $\varepsilon>0$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}E_{\varepsilon}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{i=n(k,\varepsilon)}^{\infty}\{x\in I:|f_{i}(x)-f(x)|\geq 1/k\},\end{equation}
where $n(k,\varepsilon)$ is chosen so that $m(\bigcup_{i=n(k,\varepsilon)}^{\infty}\{x\in I:|f_{i}(x)-f(x)|\geq 1/k\})<\varepsilon/2^k$. Now assume $(f_n)$ is a sequence of smooth functions, and $f\in L^1(I)$ is the limit function. Since $f$ is only determined up to a null set, the set $E_{\varepsilon}$ can only be determined up to a null set. Thus it is very natural to require $f$ to be the ""best choice"" to make $E_{\varepsilon}$ as small as possible. A satisfatory and notable case is that the family $\{E_{\varepsilon}\}$ be a sequence of nested closed intervals, thus we have $\bigcap_{\varepsilon}E_{\varepsilon}=\{x_{0}\}$, where $x_{0}\in I$. Or more generally, we can ask in which case the set $\bigcap_{\varepsilon}E_{\varepsilon}$ is a union of isolated points? However, this is not true in general case, GTM 2 (p.38) [Graduate Texts in Mathematics] contains an example in which case the set $I-E$ is nowhere dense, of course this coincides with the well-known result that every subset of the line can be represented as a union of a null set and a set of first category.","['set-theory', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

39609,Explanation why an abelian tower admits a cyclic refinement,"Now that school is wrapping up, I'm trying to crack down and get better at algebra. This proposition from Lang's Algebra loses me at the end. Proposition 3.1. Let $G$ be a finite group. An abelian tower of $G$ admits a cyclic refinement. Let $G$ be a finite solvable group. Then $G$ admits a cyclic tower, whose last element is $\{e\}$ . Proof. The second assertion is an immediate consequence of the first, and it clearly suffices to prove that if $G$ is finite, abelian, then $G$ admits a cyclic tower. We use induction on the order of $G$ . Let $x$ be an element of $G$ . We may assume that $x \neq e$ . Let $X$ be the cyclic group generated by $x$ . Let $G' = G/X$ . By induction, we can find a cyclic tower in $G'$ , and its inverse image is a cyclic tower in $G$ whose last element is $X$ . If we refine this tower by inserting $\{e\}$ at the end, we obtain the desired cyclic tower. Here is my understanding so far: (Please excuse me if a lot of the things I say are very obvious/wrong, I'm trying to be detailed for my own understanding.) If $|G|=1$ , then $\{e\}$ is the desired cyclic tower. So suppose the result holds for $|G|\leq n-1$ . Suppose $|G|=n$ . Letting $G'$ be as above, $|G'|=|G|/|X|\lt|G|$ , so by the induction hypothesis, there exists a cyclic tower in $G'$ , say $$
G'=G/X\supset G_1'\supset G_2'\supset\cdots\supset G_m'.
$$ I'm not quite sure what Lang means by ""its inverse image is a cyclic tower in $G$ whose last element is $X$ ."" Is there some assumed homomorphism $f\colon G\to G'$ , and then the inverse image of the tower would be $$
f^{-1}(G')\supset f^{-1}(G_1')\supset\cdots\supset f^{-1}(G_m')?
$$ Why is the last element of the tower $X$ , as Lang claims? Also, Lang says a normal tower is cyclic if each factor group $G_i/G_{i+1}$ in the tower is cyclic. Does this mean all the $G_i$ themselves are cyclic, or is it possible for the factor group to be cyclic, but the normal subgroup being modded out is not?

For example, $p_1(x,y,z,w)=x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2$ and $3x^2-5y^2$ are quadratic forms. I'm not sure this is relevant here, but for any such $p$ there is a symmetric matrix $A$ such that $p(\vec x)= (\vec x)^T A(\vec x)$, where we think of $\vec x$ as a column vector. $p$ is positive definite iff $p(\vec x)>0$ whenever $\vec x\ne 0$. The form is integer valued iff $p(\vec a)\in{\mathbb Z}$ whenever $\vec a\in {\mathbb Z}^n$. For short, let's say ""form"" instead of ""positive definite integer valued quadratic form"".
A form is universal iff it represents every positive integer, i.e., for all $m>0$ there is $\vec a\in{\mathbb Z}^n$ with $p(\vec a)=m$. For example , $p_1$ above is universal. I read that no form in 3 or fewer variables is universal, and I was hoping for a proof (or at least a reference if the proof is too long/convoluted for it to be written here).

$$
b_n'(x) = nb_{n-1}(x) \:\text{ and }\: \int_0^1 b_n(x) = 0 \:\text{  for  }\: n \geq 1.

$$

so that the new third condition essentially gives $a_n(x) = x^n$ for all $n$, thus simplifying matters.

I was able to show that if $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable, then so is $G$, but I can't quite show that $G$ is solvable implies $G/H$ is solvable. My idea was this.

I'm guessing the same holds for the functors $\pi_k$ (homotopy groups), $H_k$ (homology groups)? Definitions: Examples: In the category of sets, groups, rings, $R$ -modules, vector spaces, topological spaces,etc, the product is the cartesian product.

My thoughts: I'd like to show that $ f $ is necessarily continuous on $ U $, and that for any simple closed curve $ \gamma $, $ \int_\gamma f(z) dz = 0 $. Then by Morera's theorem, $f$ is analytic. Now $f_n $ tends locally uniformly to $ f$ on $U$ means that for any $ x \in U $, $ \exists r > 0 $ such that $ f_n $ tends uniformly on $ B(x;r) $ to $f$. I know that continuity is preserved under uniform convergence, and so for any $ x \in U $, $ f$ is continuous on some ball around $x$, and so is continuous at $x$. Thus $ f $ is continuous on $ U $. Let $ \gamma $ be a simple, closed curve in $ U $. Then for any $ x $ on $ \gamma $, $\exists $ $ r > 0 $ such that $ f_n $ converges uniformly to $f$ on $ B(x;r_x) $. Let $ N_x $ be the associated 'magic uniform convergence number' (for lack of a better term) for the sequence on this ball. Now, the collection of these balls for all $ x $ on $\gamma$ forms a cover of $\gamma$, and by compactness there is a finite subcover, say $ \{ B(x_i;r_i), 1 \leq i \leq n \} $. Let  $ N = \max_i N_{x_i} $. Then $ N $ gives us uniform convergence of the sequence $ f_n $ to $ f$ on $\gamma$.

Suppose that the function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable and that the following equation has at most $n-1$ solutions:
  $$f'(x)=0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}.$$
  Prove that the following equation has at most $n$ solutions:
  $$f(x)=0,\quad x \in \mathbb{R}.$$ My proof is: Let $f'(x)=0$ have solutions $x_1$, $x_2,\ldots ,x_{n-1}$. since 
$$f'(x_1)=\lim\limits_{{x}\to{x_1}}\frac{f(x)-f(x_1)}{x-x_1} = 0$$
and doing so, $f(x)=f(x_{n-1})$
Therefore $f(x)=f(x_1)=f(x_2)=\cdots=f(x_{n-1})$. Let $x_n$ be one of solutions of $f(x)=0$.
$$0=f(x_n)=f(x_1)=f(x_2)=\cdots=f(x_{n-1}),$$ 
so $f(x)=0$ has solutions like $x_1$, $x_2,\ldots, x_n$. If there is wrong part, please let me know.",['analysis']

What is the largest order of abelian group? 3)What is the Sylow-2 subgroup of $A_7$? [I am trying to get some other way to prove that there is only one simple group order 168. In a simple group $G$ of order $168$, the number of Sylow-3 subgroups is $7$, or $28$ . If it is $7$ , then $G$ is contained in $A_7$, and we get an abelian subgroup of order $12$, in $A_7$ . Certainly, $A_7$ does not contain an element of order $12$, hence cyclic subgroup of order $12$. therefore, it may happen that $A_7$ may contain $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_6$.

40022,functoriality of derivations,"I seem to have problems understanding algebraically why given a map of manifolds $f: M \to N$ we get a bundle map $TM \to f^*TN$. Now, fiberwise it's all good. But I do not understand how to define on sections, as a map of sheaves of derivations. More to the point, say we have a map of rings $\varphi: B \leftarrow A$ (which I am thinking of opposite to $f$ above, in other words $A$ is global functions on $N$ and $B$ is global functions on $M$). And say that $\varphi$ is over a ground ring $k$ (everything in site is commutative!). Now, I do not see how to get a map $Der_k(B,B) \to Der_k(A,A) \otimes_A B$ (the latter being the pullback of $TN$ on $M$). While there is an obvious map $Der_k(B,B) \to Der_k(A,B)$, given by restriction, (which can be used to prove functoriality of the cotangent bundle) I do not see why we should have that $Der_k(A,A)\otimes_A B = Der_k(A,B)$ (although of course it needn't even hold). On the other hand one might define first the map on cotangent bundles and then declare this one as the transpose (but I'm trying to get grips with which one should be more ""natural"", in some very unfair sense). I guess my last comment is important to me when $M$ and $N$ at the beginning are taken to be singular varieties instead of manifolds.","['sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

40053,How is the uniform boundedness principle compatible with this seemingly weak convergent sequence?,"In showing that $(x_i\rightharpoonup x)\not\Rightarrow(x_i\to x)$ or similar noncorallaries, one frequently uses the counterexample
$$
  (u_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\in \ell^2\colon \quad u_i = (\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{i-1},1,0,\ldots)
$$
This, if I can trust my professor, is a weak convergent sequence in $\ell^2$, because it is bounded ( I apparently missed that bit, this was the cause of the confusion ) and for each $\varphi_j=(0,\ldots,1,0,\ldots)$, there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$, namely $N=j$, such that for every $i>N$,
$$
  \langle u_i, \varphi_j \rangle_{\ell^2} = 0 + \ldots + 0\cdot1 + 0 + \ldots + 1\cdot 0 + 0\ldots = 0 < \varepsilon
$$
for all $\varepsilon>0$. Because the $\varphi_j$ form a complete orthonormal system in $\ell^2$, this is sufficient for $(u_i)_i$ to be weakly convergent. The problem is now: consider the sequence
$$
  (v_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\in \ell^2\colon \quad v_i = (\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{i-1},i,0,\ldots).
$$
You could show that this is weakly convergent in exactly the same way as I just did for $(u_i)_i$, but on the other hand, $(v_i)_i$ is obviously an unbounded sequence and according to the principle of uniform boundedness (which I don't quite understand) every weak convergent sequence is bounded. So what's wrong here? Well, as the answers pointed out that it was the requirement of $(u_i)$ being bounded which was necessary for using just the $\varphi_j$ to show weak convergence.","['examples-counterexamples', 'functional-analysis']"

40088,How to project the surface of a hypersphere into the full volume of a sphere?,"The game I mentioned in "" Navigating though the surface of a hypersphere in a computer game "" is taking shape in here . The world is a 3-sphere where everything belongs. In Euclidean coordinates, for every point $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$. We move the objects by applying orthornormal transformations to them. We got to a stage where we want to draw a mini-map to help the user navigate through the space, and that is the subject of this question. Like we use stereographic projection to get the 3-sphere into 3-D Euclidean space, how can we project the points of the 3-sphere into the full volume of a ""common"" 2-sphere? This way, all world objects could be seen in a cool sphere drawn in the corner of the screen, unlike it is with the stereographic projection, which is infinite and some points may be missing in the cropping. Considering every point $P = (x, y, z, w) \; | \; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$, we need a function $t$ where $t(P) = (X, Y, Z) \; | \; X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 \leq 1$ and $t((0,0,0,-1)) = (0,0,0)$ (the center of the stereographic projection).
