For example, $wt_2(14) = 3$ since $14$ in binary is $1110$ and that's three $1$ s; $wt_2(15) = 4$ since $15$ in binary is $1111$ and that's three $1$ s. For now, I'm unconcerned about negative integers. Now, what is $wt_2(F_n)$ ? It's at most $wt_2(F_{n - 2}) + wt_2(F_{n - 1})$ . But, except for $F_3 = 2$ , that seems like overkill.

( If it has actually been abandoned).,"I'm trying to understand the evolution of the concept of number since Frege/ Russell and to see the ""big picture"". What are the main motivations explaining the change from Russell's definition using equivalence  classes ( in ""Introduction to mathematical philosophy"") and the current definition of (natural numbers) using the successor function? The ""stages"" I can see are the following. Would you please assess the reasons I have  imagined to explain (to myself)  the passage from one stage to another? (1) Frege / Russell recognized that numbers were higher-order properties, not properties of things , but of sets (2) Numbers are defined as equivalence classes, using the relation of ""the set X is equinumerous to set Y"" (iff there exist at least one bijection from X to Y) (3) To identify each number (that is each class) we would need a ""standard"" in each class. For example, one  could use{ Thumb, Index, Middle finger, Ring finger, Pinky finger}  as a representative of the sets having 5  elements. In that case, one would say: the number 5  is the set of all X  such that there exists a bijection from X to the set { Thumb, Index, Middle finger, Ring finger, Pinky finger } and X has 5 as cardinal number iff X belongs to the set 5 (4) But the use of these representatives requires us to admit  the existence of the elements of these standards. Furthermore, it obliges us to admit that the existence of numbers depends on contingent facts of the world, that is, the existence of these elements belonging to our "" standards"". (5) So to get rid of these existential presupposions, we decide to chose as standards sets whose elements exist ""at minimal cost"". As standard for the set ""zero"", we use {  } (as we did before. But as standard for the set 1, we now use { 0 } (that certainly exists if 0 = {  } exists. and as standard for the set 2, we  use { 0, 1} , etc. In this way, our construction becomes independent of the existence of concrete things in the world. (6) We finally abandon the definition of numbers as equivalence classes (with a special element as standard) and define directly each number by its ""standard"". So instead of saying that ""2 is the set of sets that can be put in $1-1$ correspondance with the standard $\{ 0,1\}$ "", we simply say that the number $2$ is (by definition) the set $\{ 0,1\}$ . (7) We finally put this set in order using the successor function  ( $S($ number $x)$ is by definition  the union of number $x$ and of $\{x\}$ ) which ""generates"" an infinite series of numbers ""out of"" the null set.",['elementary-set-theory']

3178327,Baby Rudin 5.2: Continuity Required to prove Differentiability?,"(From Rudin Principles of Mathematical Analysis , 5.2) Suppose $f'(x) > 0$ in ( $a, b$ ). Prove that $f$ is strictly increasing in ( $a, b$ ), and let $g$ be its inverse function. Prove that $g$ is differentiable, and that $g'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f′(x)}   \quad
(a < x < b)$ Here's an answer I found online: Let $g : f(a, b) → (a, b) $ be the inverse function of $f$ , i.e., $ g(f(x)) = x $ for all $x ∈ (a, b)$ . We now show that $g′(y) = \lim\limits_{z→y} \frac {g(z) − g(y)}{z − y}$ exists for all $y ∈ f(a, b)$ . Put $y = f(x)$ and $z = f(t)$ , where $x, t ∈ (a, b)$ , then
since $f$ is continuous (by Theorem 5.2), so is $g$ (by Theorem 4.17), and $z → y$ implies $t → x$ . It follows that $$\begin{align*}
\lim_{z→y} \frac{g(z) − g(y)}{z − y} &= \lim_{t→x}\frac{g(f(t)) − g(f(x))}{f(t) − f(x)} \\
&= \lim_{t→x}\frac{t − x}{f(t) − f(x)} \\
&= \lim_{t→x}\frac{1}{\frac{f(t) − f(x)}{t − x}} \\
&= \frac{1}{f′(x)}
\end{align*}$$ Question: Why it is necessary to for g to be continuous?
The only step that uses continuity is the changing of the limit values ( $z → y$ implies $t → x$ ), but that comes from $f$ I think?","['continuity', 'proof-explanation', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
3178359,Constant sheaves on the étale site of a scheme,"I am learning étale cohomology with Tamme's book. When talking about example of abelian sheaves on the étale site, he mentions the following equality for an abelian group $A$ : let $A_X$ be the constant sheaf associated to $A$ on the étale site of $X$ and $X^{'}\to X$ an étale morphism of schemes, then $A_X(X^{'})=\mathrm{Hom}_X(X^{'},\coprod_A X)=\prod_{\text{connected components of $X^{'}$}} A$ Now I checked the first equality, but I don't see how the second equality follows when the connected components of $X^{'}$ are not open. A related question to this is, what are sufficient conditions that ensure that every étale $X$ -scheme has finitely many connected components ? It is necessary that $X$ has finitely many connected components, is it also sufficient ? To reformulate, we can, by pulling back to a connected component of $X$ , ask the following : if $X$ is a connected scheme, does every étale $X$ -scheme have finitely many connected components ? I suspect it is false, I think we can look for a connected scheme with an open subscheme that has infinitely many connected components (that is something similar to $\mathbf{Q}\subset\mathbf{R}$ ), but the counterexample must lie outside the noetherian world and so also out of my comfort zone.

3179152,Number of combinations of 12 donuts with 8 choices of flavor with restrictions (at least and at most),"I'm working on a homework of combinatorics for a discrete math course. Please excuse any mistakes on my writing, English isn't my first language. I already did all the problem, but there's obviously overcounting in my steps. I would like to know where I made a mistake. So, I have a problem where I need to calculate the possible combinations for different contexts on the selection of 12 donuts out of 8 flavors with repetitions allowed. I browsed some questions on the website, but they all seem a bit too complicated for my specific problem, and as mentioned, I already answered the questions, but the last one seems not right. First question : What is the number of possible combinations of 12 donuts out of 8 flavors, repetitions allowed? Simple, I used the method which I think is called ""Stars and bars"" used on many topics from the website which is defined in my book by : $C(k + t - 1, t - 1)$ where : $X$ = a set containing the choices (flavors in our case) $k$ = the number of selected Items from X (the dozen of donuts) $t$ = $\Vert$ X $\Vert$ So it gives me $C(12 + 8 - 1, 8 - 1) = C(19, 7) = 50388$ Second question : I need the number of combinations where there is at most 2 vanilla donuts and at least 3 strawberry donuts. Here, I calculated the combinations of $2$ donuts from $8$ flavors, so I'll have at most $2$ vanilla donuts : $C(2 + 8 - 1, 8 - 1) = C(9, 7) = 36$ Then, $7$ other donuts from $7$ flavors (removed the vanilla flavor) : $C(7 + 7 - 1, 7 - 1) = C(13, 6) = 1716$ Finally, the 3 others that needs to be strawberry : $1$ combination only. So, by the multiplication principle, I'll have $36*1716*1 = 61776$ combinations, which is more than the first question, but with restrictions, which isn't logic. Could you please point me my mistake?

Now what I got is: $|X|= |L| = n^2 + n + 1$ So there are exactly 133 points and 133 lines. Because the plane is of order 11 i know that there are 12 points on a single line. a) Each two lines intersect at only one point, so for 4 lines to have a non-empty intersection they'd have to intersect in the same point. For each point I know that there are 12 lines which interesect it so I get: $$133 \cdot \binom{12}{4} $$ b) Each line consists of 12 points so to get unordered 7-tuple of points $$133\cdot\binom{12}7{}$$ Therefore there are more unordered 7-tuples of points belonging to the same line than there are 4-tuples of lines inciding with the same point.

I did not understand what it has to do with Archimedean property. As Archimedean property is established upon completeness I would rather try to prove it from that. Consider $A=\{m|m<x,\forall m\in R\}$ Now a is bounded hence sup exists(say $\alpha$ . So $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists a\in A$ such that $$\alpha-\epsilon < a \leq \alpha $$ But taking $\epsilon=1$ does not really prove the required statement. We have to show that $\alpha$ and $\alpha-1$ to be integers. So this approach failed. My book's proof Proof consists of two parts 1)To show $x \geq n$ 2) To show $n+1>x$ It proves (1) with constructing a set $$\{m:m<x,\forall m\in Z\}$$ and says that it is bounded above so it has suprema say $n,n\in Z$ thus $x\geq n$ . 2) To prove (2) it does not give any explanation. I think it has been done using Archimedean property ie. $\forall x\in R \exists m\in Z$ such that $m>x$ But my question is how to prove $m=n+1$ ?

But, if we replace the expression "" $G$ -set"" with "" finite $G$ -set"", the definition of $\mathbb QB(G)$ makes sense for any group $G$ , and it seems natural to ask Question. Do we have $\mathbb QB(G)\simeq\mathbb QB(H)$ if $G$ and $H$ are groups such that $\dim_{\mathbb Q}\mathbb QB(G)=\dim_{\mathbb Q}\mathbb QB(H)$ ? The Burnside $\mathbb Q$ -algebra $\mathbb QB(G)$ of a group $G$ is canonically isomorphic to that of its profinite completion. The dimension of the Burnside $\mathbb Q$ -algebra of a profinite group is finite if and only if the group is finite (but an infinite group may have a finite profinite completion). For any group $G$ we chose a set $S(G)$ of representatives of the conjugacy classes of finite index subgroups of $G$ . The Burnside $\mathbb Q$ -algebra $\mathbb QB(G)$ is von Neumann regular. Indeed, if $b$ is in $\mathbb QB(G)$ , then there is a largest finite index normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $b\in\mathbb QB(G/N)$ . Let $\phi_{G/N}:\mathbb QB(G/N)\to\mathbb Q^{S(G/N)}$ be the $\mathbb Q$ -algebra isomorphism defined in Section 3.3 of [1], and define $b'\in\mathbb QB(G/N)\subset\mathbb QB(G)$ by $$
b'=(\phi_{G/N})^{-1}\Big(w\circ(\phi_{G/N}(b)\Big),
$$ where $w:\mathbb Q\to \mathbb Q$ is defined by $w(\lambda)=\frac1\lambda$ if $\lambda\ne0$ and $w(0)=0$ (that is, $w$ is a witness to the von Neumann regularity of $\mathbb Q$ ), so that we have $b^2b'=b$ in $\mathbb QB(G)$ , which shows that $\mathbb QB(G)$ is von Neumann regular. (In this post $X\subset Y$ means "" $X$ is a (not necessarily proper) subset of $Y$ "".) Assume from now on that all the finite index subgroups of $G$ are normal (for instance because $G$ is abelian). In particular $S(G)$ is the set of all finite index subgroups of $G$ . We will ""compute"" $\mathbb QB(G)$ in this case. Using the notation and results in Section 3.2 of [1] we have a $\mathbb Q$ -algebra injective morphism $\phi_G:\mathbb QB(G)\to\mathbb Q^{S(G)}$ given by $$
\Big(\phi_G(G/K)\Big)(H)=m(H,K),

\phi_G\left(\frac{G/K}{|G/K|}\right)

3179501,Visualizing the Lie Bracket in connection with Torsion,"I have seen this kind of picture a lot, linking the Lie Bracket with the Torsion (e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ). I will report for convenience one of such picture, from Hehl and Obukhov review article For some reason I am not able to understand how the Lie Bracket can be seen in that way. I will say what I have done so far, I would be glad if someone would point me to the missing piece or maybe if I am misunderstanding the approximation done. Let us take two vector fields $u$ and $v$ on a manifold $M$ . Choose a $P\in M$ , we can say that $$
u_P = u^k \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_P
$$ $$
v_P = v^k \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_P
$$ Let me say with abuse of notation that $R=P+\epsilon v$ and $Q=P+\epsilon u$ (I believe the formal way would be to go down in the chart and then coming back with the inverse). Anyway $u$ in $R$ is $$
u_R \approx \left( u^k +\epsilon v^i \frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^i} \right) \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_R \approx
\left( u^k + \epsilon v^i \frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^i} + \epsilon v^i u^j \Gamma_{ij}^k + O(\epsilon^2)\right) \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_P
$$ while the parallel transport of $u$ along $v$ $$
u_R^{//} \approx \left( u^k - \epsilon \Gamma_{ij}^k v^i u^j \right) \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_R \approx 
\left( u^k + O(\epsilon^2) \right) \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_P
$$ Which I reported in the tangent space of $P$ , using the fact that \begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_R = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \right)_P + \epsilon v^i \Gamma_{ik}^j \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} \right)_P
\end{equation} Now that my vectors all belong to the same tangent space $T_P M$ I can finally verify $$
u_R - u_R^{//} = \nabla_{v} u 
$$ If I want to get the Lie Bracket from the drawing, I can calculate the vectors $u_R$ and $v_Q$ , report them in $P$ and combine them accordingly, i.e. \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(u_P + v_Q) - (v_P + u_R) &= u^k + v^k + \epsilon v^i u^j \Gamma_{ij}^k + \epsilon v^i \frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^i} - \left( u^k + v^k + \epsilon u^i v^j \Gamma_{ij}^k + \epsilon u^i \frac{\partial v^k}{\partial x^i} \right) \\
&= \epsilon v^i u^j T_{ij}^k - \epsilon [u,v]
\end{split}
\end{equation} So also the torsion appears to me in that subtraction, and that is why I cannot understand that picture... What am I missing?
It seems to me that I should not report the vectors back in P, but then how can I add or subtract vectors in different tangent spaces?

Intuitively, if you think of defining $X_n$ as a procedure, we can simply do it like this: Pseudocode: i=1
prove X_1 subset of \Phi    
while true
    Define X_{i+1} using the fact that X_i is a subset of $\Phi$ Prove that X_{i+1} is a subset of $\Phi$ .

3179651,Is it appropriate to use clustering to partition the dependent variable into separate datasets for a home price prediction model?,"I'm struggling to decide how to deal with a heteroskedasticity problem in a home price prediction model I'm developing. The training set residuals are normally distributed around zero, but they have an average absolute error of nearly 20%. As expected, there is lower variability among the observations with low sale values and higher variability among the observations with higher sale values. Something we are trying to achieve is equity - that is to say, lower value homes are predicted approximately as accurately as higher value homes. Because our current model doesn't do that so well, we are looking for a solution. One thing I though might help would be to use a k-means clustering algorithm on the dependent variable to partition the dataset based on home value - so, we would have three datasets, one each for low, medium, and high values. I was first (and still am) wondering if this algorithm should be applied on the whole dataset before defining training and test sets, or if we should define training and test sets before clustering and then create additional training and test sets based on those clusters. However, now I'm moreso wondering if there are bias issues we need to worry about, and if this is generally an appropriate way to do this, or if there are better ways to address this problem. For context, this model is a hedonic model using OLS. We've already used spatial clustering to define geographic areas within a broader study area and partitioned the dataset accordingly (our reasoning for doing this as opposed to using indicator variables for the geographic clusters is that the variability in the independent variables with respect to the geographic clusters couldn't possibly be captured using a single binary for each). We are going to also run spatial lag/error models and random forest models to see how they perform, but it's doubtful they'll reduce the absolute error as drastically as we need (we want prediction accuracy of under 10%).","['statistics', 'regression', 'clustering', 'machine-learning', 'data-analysis']"
3179667,Does this system of equations have attractors and periodic solutions?,"I want to solve the following exercise: Determine the critical points of the system \begin{align}
\dot{x} &= x^2- y^3\\
\dot{y} &= 2x(x^2 - y)
\end{align} Are there attractors in this system? Determine a first integral. Do periodic solutions exist? What I've tried so far: I think that I've found the critical points of this system. If I inspect \begin{align}
x^2 - y^3 = 0\\
2x(x^2 - y) = 0
\end{align} I find that $x = 0$ or $x = \pm \sqrt{y}$ . Case $x = 0$ : $-y^3 = 0$ so that $y = 0$ . Hence the first critical point that I find is $(0,0)$ . Case $x = \pm\sqrt{y}$ : $y - y^3 = 0$ so $y=1$ or $y = -1$ . If $y = -1$ then $x = \pm i$ . If $y = 1$ then $x = \pm1$ . Hence I find the critical points $(1, 1), (i, -1), (-1,1),$ and $(-i,-1)$ . I think that I've found a first integral by looking at the equation $$
\dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{dt}}{\dfrac{dx}{dt}} = \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{2x^3 - 2xy}{x^2 - y^3}
$$ Integrating this final equation gives $$
\int \dfrac{2x^3 - 2xy}{x^2 - y^3}dx = y(y^2 - 1)\log(y^3 - x^2) + x^2 + C
$$ Hence a first integral of this system is $$
F(x,y) = y(y^2 - 1)\log(y^3 - x^2) + x^2
$$ I tried plotting this function to find out if the system of equations has periodic solutions but I don't get any wiser looking at the plots. I have the following definitions of an attractor: A critical point $x = a$ of the equation $\dot{x} = f(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a positive attractor if there exists a neighborhood $\Omega_a\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of $x = a$ such that $x(t_0)\in\Omega_a$ implies $\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t) = a$ . If a critical point $x = a$ has this property for $t \to - \infty$ then $x = a$ is called a negative attractor. I think that in order to determine whether either of the critical points is an attractor I need to know what the solution $x(t)$ looks like. I'm not sure how to solve this system though and if I enter the equations in wolfram then I don't get a solution either (I might be missing something). So therefore I tried to linearize the equations. I have: $$
f(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix}x^2 - y^3\\2x(x^2 - y)\end{pmatrix}, \dfrac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial(x,y)} = \begin{pmatrix}2x & -3y^2\\6x^2& -2x\end{pmatrix}, \dfrac{\partial^2f(x,y)}{\partial (x,y)^2} = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -6y\\12x & 0\end{pmatrix}, \\\dfrac{\partial^3 f(x,y)}{\partial (x,y)^3} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -6\\12 & 0\end{pmatrix}
$$ Hence, using the Taylor expansion around $(x,y) = (0,0)$ I get \begin{align}
\dot{x} &= x^2 - y^3 + \ldots\\
\dot{y} &= 2x^3 + \ldots
\end{align} but I'm not really sure how I can use this to learn anything new.. Question: How can I learn more about this system so that I will be able to say more about the existence of attractors and periodic solutions? Is my reasoning thus far correct?","['approximation', 'taylor-expansion', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

show that the K-nearest-neighbor density model defines an improper distribution whose integral over all space is divergent. I'm not sure how to set up the integral to show that the distribution is improper... I suspect it's a simple solution, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to get traction on it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Edit:
for K=k you've got the region split into a kth order Voronoi tessellation, which leaves the full normalizing integral as a sum of integrals across each disjoint region. Setting K=1 and N=1 (for the simplest case) you've got $$ \int p(x) = \int dx/V(x) = \int \frac{\Gamma(D/2)D\,dx}{2\pi^{D/2}\parallel x - p_c \parallel^D} = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{D\,dr}{r^D}$$ , where $p_c$ is the closest point (our one observed point in my simple case). I might have made a mistake above, but intuitively, I take this to mean that the distribution p(x) is ill-defined for the points in the observed dataset (since the volume of the sphere centered on $p_c$ with $p_c$ on the boundary is zero, so p(x) explodes to infinity at those points). That gives one possible reason why this is an improper distribution for K=1, but look at K=2 in the case of N=2: The sphere is defined by the radius needed to enclose the farthest point, meaning there's a boundary surface dividing the feature space in half, where every point on that surface has the same distance to both points. Our integral then for one side of that surface involves integrating with the volume coming from the distance to the far point on the other side of the surface, and then the integral on the other side is identical since the space is symmetrically split. I have no idea how to even approximate that integral, but it at least doesn't have the singularity issue that comes up with K=1.

Shouldn't the four equations be enough to determine the exact conditions for $a, b, c$ and $d$ ?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
3180065,Are are infinitely many intimate pairs of integers?,"Using the standard statistical definitions, the variance of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and the squared errors about its mean $\mu$ are given by $\sigma^2 = \sum_i(x_i - \mu)^2/n$ and $\delta_2 = \sum_i(x_i - \mu)^2 = n\sigma^2$ respectively. Definition 1 : The variance and the squared error of an integer is defined as the variance and the squared error of its positive divisors
  respectively. I found that: There are distinct integer pairs whose variances are equal. The smallest such pair is $(691, 817)$ . Let us call them equivarient integers. There are integer pairs whose squared errors are equal. The smallest such pair is $(45, 53)$ . The more interesting fact is that there are equivarient pairs which have the same number of divisors and hence their squared errors are also equal. We define: Definition 2 : Two distinct integers are said to be an intimate pair if they are have the same number of divisors and the same
  variance. The first few intimate pairs are $(1403,1461)$ , $(1564,1572)$ , $(2068,2076)$ , $(2249,2305)$ , $(3397,3493)$ , $(7871,8193)$ , $ (23903,24101)$ , $(61769, 64443)$ . Questions : Are there infinitely many intimate pairs? Are there three or more integers that are intimate ( and what should we call them hahaha) Note : Please let me know in case there is any reference in literature. I could not find any.

3180105,Prove existence of a Heteroclinic Orbit,"How would you go around proving that there exists a heteroclinic orbit between two equilibria ( in the problem I'm trying to solve, one is a stable node(say n) and the other is a saddle (say s))? I started by finding the stable manifold of the stable node and the unstable manifold of the saddle point. Next, I want to show that their intersection is not empty and so there must be a trajectory that starts at s and end at n. And therefore, a heteroclinic orbit.
But the problem is that the stable manifold only ""covers"" a neighborhood of n. Same for the unstable manifold. So how do we figure out the neighborhoods I guess?
Or is there a better way to do this than using the stable and unstable manifolds? Edit: This is the system of ODEs I'm dealing with. $$U' = V\\
 V' = -\frac{c}{D}V -\frac{\mu}{D} U (1-U)\\$$ All of the parameters are positive. and $c>\sqrt{4\mu D}$ .
So we have two equilibria:
A stable node: (U,V) = (0,0).
And a saddle point: (U,V) = (1,0). Thanks","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'stability-in-odes', 'hamilton-equations', 'manifolds', 'dynamical-systems']"

What's the probability that the $n$ -simplex formed by these $n+1$ points contain the center of the sphere? I conjecture that the result is $\frac{1}{2^n}$ . For $n=2$ , it's easy: $$\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\pi-|\pi-\theta|}{2\pi}d\theta = \frac{1}{4}$$ For $n=3$ , I compute and the result is $1/8$ : By the same method, but need to use spherical triangle area formula and spherical triangle cosine rule The detailed computation is following: Very complicated function integration, I can hardly imagine that such a numerical integration has analytical solution $1/8$ . And this complicated method is hard to be generalized to higher dimension. There should be some simple explanation and can be generalized to higher dimension case.","['calculus', 'probability-theory', 'geometric-probability']"
3180148,Show that there are at least two points on a manifold to which a vector is normal,"Let $M \subset \mathbb R^3$ be a $2$ -dimensional manifold which is also a compact set. And let $v \in \mathbb R^3$ be a vector which satisfies $ ||v|| = 1$ . The task is to prove that there are at least two points $x,y \in M$ such that $v$ is a normal vector to their tangent spaces. There was given a hint to look at the extremum points of the function $f(x) = <x,v>$ which means $f(x) = x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + x_3v_3$ . Since the functions is continuous and $M$ is compact then the function get a minimum and maximum on $M$ . Let's say the $x$ is the maximum and $y$ is a the minimum. Moreover, I noticed that $\nabla f = (v_1,v_2,v_3) = v$ . However, I am not so sure how to continue from here. I am supposed to show that $v$ is normal to both $T_xM$ and $T_yM$ but I don't see how exactly. I still haven't used the fact that $M$ is a manifold so it probably uses that.

3180173,Proportion of a compartment's mass which originates from another compartment,"System & Objective I have the following open system (mass flow) with 2 compartments $A$ and $B$ and constant flow rates $a,b,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$ . I would like an expression for "" the proportion of $A(t)$ at time $t$ which originated from $B(t)$ "", denoted $A_B(t)$ . We can assume originally no mass in $A$ came from $B$ -- i.e. $A_B(t=0) = 0$ . Approach I assume the proportion could be expressed as a fraction, $$ A_B(t) = \frac{N(t)}{D(t)} $$ where the denominator is simply the current mass in $A$ , $D(t) = A(t)$ ; and the numerator $N(t)$ is the absolute mass currently in $A$ which originated from $B$ . I'm struggling to derive an expression for $N(t)$ . I defined the cumulative mass which enters $A$ from $B$ as $$ T_{A_B}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} b B(\tau) d\tau $$ but we also need an expression for the cumulative mass which exits $A$ after entering from $B$ , denoted $E_{A_B}(t)$ . I would then define $N(t) = T_{A_B}(t) - E_{A_B}(t)$ . I had three approaches to defining $E_{A_B}(t)$ ... is any correct? Cumulative Exit Attempt 1: \begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
E_{A_B}(t) &= \int_{0}^{t} (\alpha + a) T_{A_B}(\tau) d\tau \\
&= \int_{0}^{t} (\alpha + a) \left(\int_{0}^{\tau} b B(s) ds \right) d\tau
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} But this double integral seems wrong and would blow up for large $t$ . Cumulative Exit Attempt 2: \begin{equation}
E_{A_B}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} (\alpha + a) b B(\tau) d\tau
\end{equation} But this doesn't seem right either, as the exit only depends on the current value of $B(t)$ . Cumulative Exit Attempt 3: \begin{equation}
E_{A_B}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} (\alpha + a) A(\tau) A_B(\tau) d\tau
\end{equation} But this would result in recursive definition of $A_B(t)$ , and I'm not sure how I could rearrange to isolate $A_B(t)$ from the the LHS and the RHS integral. Overall, is this a reasonable approach? Any ideas how to derive either $E_{A_B}(t)$ , or $A_B(t)$ by another approach altogether? I feel like I should be using Laplace.

How could I show this fact, knowing only the definition of a measure zero set ?

Could you give me just an hint, please? Edit. We could consider as known the following properties: A single point is a set of measure zero; A countable union of measure zero set is a measure zero set; A subset of a measure zero set is of measure zero; Any closed interval $[a,b]$ with $a<b$ is not a set of measure zero.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
