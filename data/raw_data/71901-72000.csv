881293,How many solutions to quadratic logarithms?,"For a given Log equation with a quadratic $x$, such as $$F(x)=\log(x^2)$$there appear to be two $x$ values, for every $F(x)$, a positve and   a negative. However, if $F(x)$ is rearanged,$$F(x)=2\log(x)$$
 then there is only one $x$ value, for every $F(x)$. How does this work? Another way of looking at it is that the first equation, will produce two curves, one on either side of the $y$ axis, but the second will only produce one, even though they appear to be the same graph.","['logarithms', 'functions']"
881296,"Show that there is sequence of homeomorphism polynomials on [0,1] that converge uniformly to homeomorphism","Let $f:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ be a homeomorphism. Show that , there exists a sequence of polynomials  $$(P_n(x))_n$$ such that $P_n(x)$ converge uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and every $P_n(x)$ is a homeomorphism from $[0,1]$ to itself. I think that if we put additional condition that f be $C^1$ then $f'$ will be non-negative and continuous. Moreover, Weierstrass theorem says that there will be exist non-negative sequence of polynomials $(Q_n(x))_n$ such that it converges uniformly to $f'$ on $[0.1]$. Now it seems that $$P_n(x)=\int_{\mathbb{0}}^{x}Q_n(t)\:dt$$ works . Is this true ? Is there other ways? Thanks","['general-topology', 'uniform-convergence', 'analysis']"
881315,When a system of rational linear equations have complex solutions does it have rational solutions?,"Problem: The fact that a system of rational linear equations 
  $Ax=0$ has a nontrivial complex solution (not necessarily rational), does it imply that it also admit a nontrivial rational one? One solution is as follows: Write $Ax = 0$, where $x = (x_1,\cdots,x_n)^T$ is the complex solution. Let $V$ be the $\mathbb{Q}$-span of $\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$, and let $\{y_1,\cdots,y_m\}$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of $V$. Then we have $By =x$, where $B$ is a matrix of rational entries and $y = (y_1,\cdots,y_m)^T$. Then from $ABy = 0$ we deduce that $AB= 0$ since $y$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis and $AB$ is a rational matrix. Thus any column of $B$ is a rational solution of the original equation. Question: Is it true for ""inhomogeneous"" linear systems? That is: if $A$ is a rational matrix and $b$ is a rational vector such that $Ax = b$ has a complex solution, does it imply that it also has a rational solution?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

881413,"Relations examples (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity)","I've found the two textbooks I'm using to to be particularly unhelpful in explaining these concepts, especially as they relate to English examples (non-existent). The first few following questions have answers provided, but I would like to understand why they are correct. Determine whether the relation R on the set of all Web pages is reﬂexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and/or transitive, where (a, b) ∈ R if and only if: a) everyone who has visited Web page a has also visited Web page b. correct answer: reflexive, transitive so R: {(a,b) | everyone who has visited a has also visited b} I thought this was anti-symmetrical because it's not necessarily the case that everyone who has visited b has also visited a.  That is, we have (a,b) but not (b,a).  But I see now maybe it is impossible to actually say anything about (b,a) given this piece of information? I then consider it may be reflexive because everyone who has visited a has also visited a (ie., a = a, b = b, and the same would hold for all web pages c, d, and so on).  Am I understanding this properly?  If this is true, does transitivity stem form the fact that we have (a,a) and (a,b)? The next three: b) there are no common links found on both Webpage a and Web page b. c) there is at least one common link on Web page a and Web page b. d) there is a Web page that includes links to both Web page a and Web page b. correct answer: symmetrical for each I have interpreted these to be symmetrical because every given relation R here shows (a,b) = (b,a), where the relation is no common links, at least one common link, or at least one webpage linking them both.  Because the relations say nothing about pages linking to themselves (reflexivity), page a linking to b but not b linking  a (anti-symmetry), or lack of any given instance like (a,b) and (a,a) or (a,b) (b,c) and (a,c) (transitivity). These questions do not have answers, but I would like to know if my reasoning here is sound, to make sure I'm understanding what is going on.  The questions are similar to above, given a relation on the set of all people. a) a is taller than b. I believe this is anti-symmetrical because a is taller than b, but it's not the case (and would be impossible) that b is taller than a. b) a and b were born on the same day. I believe this is symmetrical because (a,b) = (b,a), where the relation is their birthdays, which are the same. c) a has the same ﬁrst name as b. Symmetrical for similar reasons above (the same first name). d) a and b have a common grandparent. Again, symmetrical due to their common grandparent.

881423,Why does convolution not maintain asymptotic equality of coefficients?,"Assume I have four (generating) functions $f$, $f'$, $g$ and $g'$. If that is interesting, we can assume that they all share the same radius of convergence $\rho > 0$. In addition, we know that $\qquad [z^n]f(z) \sim [z^n]f'(z)$ and $\qquad [z^n]g(z) \sim [z^n]g'(z)$. Now we are interested in whether $\qquad [z^n](f \ast g)(z) \sim [z^n](f' \ast g')(z)$ where $\ast$ denotes (discrete) convolution . That is, we would like to obtain asymptotics for the coefficients of a generating function by replacing factors with ""equivalent"" functions. I think this is not always true. Intuitively, coefficients of small $n$ -- which can be arbitrarily bad in $f'$ and $g'$ -- factor into all coefficients of the product; hence the error is blown up and need not vanish in the limit. What I don't have is a counter-example and/or a rigorous argument for above intuition (if it's accurate). What are such?","['convolution', 'asymptotics', 'generating-functions', 'complex-analysis']"
881451,At most one connected component of unbounded portion of entire function.,"Suppose $f$ is an entire complex analytic function and $R$ a positive real number. Define the set $E:= \{z\in\mathbb{C};|f(z)| < R\}$ to be the set of $z$ whose image is bounded by $R$. I want to show that the complement $E^c$ has at most one connected component. $E^c$ has zero components $\iff E^c = \varnothing \iff f$ is bounded by $R \implies f$ is constant. So we can assume $E^c$ has at least one component. If $f$ is instead bounded by a larger constant $S>R$, then $E^c$ will have one component consisting of a single point. So assume $f$ is unbounded. The boundary $\partial E^c = \{z\in\mathbb{C};|f(z)|=R\}$. So if a component $A$ is bounded, then since $|f| \geq R$ in $A$ and $|f|=R$ on $\partial A$, by maximum modulus principle, $f$ is constant in $A$. If $A$ has nonempty interior, this implies $f$ is a constant function. If $A$ has empty interior, then if there is an open neighborhood of $A$ contained in $E$, $f$ will again be constant by the maximum modulus principle. If $A$ has no such open neighborhood, there there must be a sequence in $E^c\setminus A$ converging to a point in $A$, which seems problematic but I'm not sure what else I can say about A. Assuming that every component of $E^c$ must be unbounded and that $E^c$ has more than $1$ component, $E$ must also be unbounded, since if there were an open neighborhood of $\infty$ disjoint from $E$, then all components of $E^c$ would meet near $\infty$. So every open neighborhood of $\infty$ intersects both $E$ and $E^c$. This is enough to show that $\infty$ is an essential singularity of $f$, which implies that $f$ is not a polynomial. Another way to see that $f$ is nonpolynomial is to observe that $E$ and $E^c$ both being unbounded implies that $\partial E^c$ is unbounded, hence noncompact, but $\partial E^c = f^{-1}(\{|z|=R\})$ is the preimage of a compact set. So $f$ is not a proper map and cannot be a polynomial. [EDIT:] The condition on connected components is not something I've used too often, so I don't know many ways to make use of it. An open set is simply connected if and only if its complement in the extended plane is connected, but due to the unboundedness of each component of $E^c$, $E$ will be simply connected. But then we could define logarithms on $E$ if $0\notin E$ (or we could translate $f$ to achieve $0\notin E$). We could take a pair of points $z_1, z_2$ in separate components of $E^c$, which could possibly have been helpful when working with winding numbers of paths in $E$, except here $E$ is simply connected. So this isn't useful because there is a natural bijection between paths $\gamma\subset E$, up to homotopy, and functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying a Hölder continuity condition with constant $\alpha>1$, up to $\mathbb{R}$-scalar multiplication. At this point I can't figure out anything else about $f$. What to do?","['general-topology', 'complex-analysis']"
881481,Fun quiz: where did the infinitely many candies come from?,"Story 1: Let there be a bowl $A$ with countably infinite many of candies indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Let bowl $B$ be empty. After $1/2$ unit of time, we take candy number 1 and 2 from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy 1 from bowl $B$. After $1/4$ unit of time, we take candy number 3 and 4 from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy 2 from bowl B. After $(1/2)^n$ unit of time, we take candy number  $2n-1$ and $2n$ from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy $n$ from bowl $B$. What happens after 1 unit of time? How many candies are there left in $A$, how many in $B$, how many have you eaten? Answer: There are no candies in $A$ left. For any candy corresponding to a given natural number $k$, one can compute the time it was eaten. Similarly there are no candies in $B$. We ate as many candies as the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$. Story 2: Let there be a bowl $A$ with countably infinite many of candies indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Let bowl $B$ be empty. After $1/2$ unit of time, we take candy number 1 and 2 from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy 1 from bowl $B$. After $1/4$ unit of time, we take candy number 3 and 4 from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy 3 from bowl B. After $(1/2)^n$ unit of time, we take candy number  $2n-1$ and $2n$ from $A$ and put them in $B$. Then we eat candy $2n-1$ from bowl $B$. What happens after 1 unit of time? How many candies are there left in $A$, how many in $B$, how many have you eaten? Answer: As before, there are no candies in $A$ left. All the candies labelled by even numbers are in $B$, so there are countably many. We ate all the candies labelled by odd numbers, so we ate countably many. Question: The main question is, in both stories we do essentially the same thing: take two candies from $A$ to $B$, then eat one from $B$. The difference is that in the second case we have infinitely many candies left in $B$, but in the first case it was empty after 1 unit of time. So how did this happen? Imagine this situation: let $X$ be conducting the eating according to story 1 with his labeling, let $Y$ be watching. But $Y$ secretly has a different labeling scheme in his mind, where the candy number $k$ in $X$'s labeling is candy number $2k-1$ in $Y$'s labeling. Then after unit time, according to $Y$, there should be infinitely many candies in $A$ but according to $X$ it should be empty. So the reality depends on the spectator?","['elementary-set-theory', 'paradoxes']"

881546,Examples of pairs of difficult integrals,"I’m looking for pairs of difficult definite integrals that are linked algebraically on a certain field without known change of variable or integration by parts from one integral to the other.

Usually, when you try to evaluate an integral in closed form, you make use of transformations to bring it to a new integral which is a well-known integral.  You end up with an algebraic relation between your integrals. Let’s say your integrals are ‘chromatic’ with respect to a field. When two integrals are ‘chromatic’, evaluating one gives the answer for the other.
Your current tools among your transformations are: change of variable and integration by parts. What if we suppress these common tools?  What is left then? This post is supposed to obtain some explicit examples of ‘chromatic’ difficult integrals that, as far as we know, are not linked from a change of variable or an integration by parts.","['definite-integrals', 'closed-form', 'calculus', 'integration']"

(The calculus proof: if $f(x)=\tan x-x$ then $f'(x)=\sec^2 x-1>0$ so $f$ is increasing, and $f(0)=0$.) $\tan x$ is defined to be $\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$ where these are defined by their infinite series. What I have so far: $$|z|\le1\implies\left|\sum_{n=4}^\infty\frac{z^n}{n!}\right|<\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{|z|^4}{4!\,5^n}=\frac{5|z|^4}{4\cdot 4!}$$

However, this only covers the region $x\le1$, and I still need to bound $\tan x$ on $(1,\pi/2)$. My best approximation to $\pi$ is the very crude $2<\pi<4$, derived by combining the above bounds with the double angle formulas (note that $\pi$ is defined as the smallest positive root of $\sin x$), so I can't quite finish the proof with a bound like $\sin x>1/\sqrt 2$, $\cos x\le\pi/2-x$ (assuming now $x\ge1\ge\pi/4$) because the bound is too tight.

Find $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. I solved the problem like this. Because both the compositions are polynomials is $x$, it is clear that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ also both will be polynomials in $x$. Let $\deg (f)=m, \deg (g)=n$. Then it follows that $m, n\leq 2$ cause otherwise the compositions will be polynomials of degree more than 2. Now if both $m, n=2$ then $f\circ g, g\circ f$ will be of degree more than 2, contradiction again. Hence one of them will be 2 and the other will be 1. WOLOG let us assume that $m=2, n=1$. Then we assume $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c, g(x)=dx+e$ we have $f\circ g=a(dx+e)^2+b(dx+e)+c= ad^2x^2+(2ade+bd)x+ae^2+be+c$ and $g\circ f=d(ax^2+bx+c)+e=dax^2+dbx+dc+e$.

Is there a name for the procedure of restating the problem as above? Or a name for the type of the original equation? Perhaps it would be more natural with tensor notation - I'm not that familiar with that area. One other note: the original equation can be be rewritten as the following two forms: $$ 
X = A X A + K
$$
and (assuming $A$ is not singular)
$$
X = A^{-1} \left( X -  K \right) A^{-1}
$$
... and it seems to me that one of these (depending on the properties of $A$) may be usable as a iterator that will converge to the correct value of $X$. In some applications this may easier to work with than the full solution.",['linear-algebra']
882190,Vanishing pushforward implies smooth function is locally constant?,"I'm trying to prove that if the pushforward $dF$ of a smooth map $F\colon M\to N$ between smooth manifolds is zero, then $F$ is constant on each component. It will be enough to show $F$ is locally constant, since locally constant functions on constant on connected domains. If $p\in M$, let $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be charts witnessing smoothness of $F$ at $p$, with local coordinates $(x^i)$ and $(y^j)$. If $\hat{F}$ is the coordinate representation, then we have
$$
0=dF_p\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_p\right)=\sum_j\frac{\partial{\hat{F}^j}}{\partial x^i}(\hat{p})\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}|_{F(p)}
$$ But the $\partial/\partial y^j|_{F(p)}$ form a basis for $T_{F(p)}N$, so it follows that $\partial\hat{F}^j/\partial x^i(\hat{p})=0$ for all $i$ and $j$. So $\hat{F}$ has vanishing Jacobian at $\hat{p}$, which is the coordinate representative of $p$. Does this imply that $\hat{F}$ is locally constant at $\hat{p}$ for some reason? I presume this is a known fact but I have a gap in my analysis. I feel like that's the point here, but I'm not sure because for instance paraboloids have vanishing partials are their vertex, but aren't locally constant there.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
882204,Integrable function $f$ and simple function $\phi$ such that $ \int{|f-\phi|} \> d\mu < \epsilon.$,"I am seeking solution verification for the following problem. Suppose $f$ is an integrable function. We wish to show that there exists a simple function $\phi$ such that $$ \int{|f-\phi|} \> d\mu < \epsilon.$$ Attempt: Write $f = f^{+} - f^{-}$. The functions $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$ are non-negative measurable functions, and our assumption implies that there integrals are finite. These functions can be approximated by monotonically increasing sequences of simple functions. In particular, there exists a sequence of simple functions $(\psi_{n})$ that monotonically increases to $f^{+}$ and there exists a sequence of simple functions $(\psi^{'}_{n})$ that monotonically increases to $f^{-}$. The Monotone Convergence Theorem implies $$\lim \int{\psi_{n}} \> d\mu = \int{f^{+}} \> d\mu$$ and $$\lim \int{\psi^{'}_{n}} \> d\mu = \int{f^{-}} \> d\mu.$$ Now, take $N$ large enough so that $n \geq N$ implies $$\left| \int{f^{+}} \> d\mu - \int{\psi_{n}} \> d\mu \right| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}.$$ Likewise, take $N'$ large enough so that $n \geq N'$ implies $$\left|\int{f^{-}} \> d\mu - \int{\psi^{'}_{n}} \> d\mu \right| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ Observe that $|\int{f^{+}} \> d\mu - \int{\psi_{n}} \> d\mu| = \int{f^{+}} \> d\mu - \int{\psi_{n}} \> d\mu = \int{f^{+}-\psi_{n}} \> d\mu$ because $\psi_{n} \leq f^{+} $ for each $n$ and the linearity of the integral. The analogue is true for $f^{-}$ and $\psi^{'}_{n}$. Put $\phi = \psi_{N} - \psi^{'}_{N'}$.
Then, \begin{align} \int{|f-\phi|} \> d\mu &= \int{|f^{+}-f^{-}-\psi_{N} + \psi^{'}_{N'}|} \> d\mu \\ &\leq \int{|f^{+}-\psi_{N}|+|-f^{-} + \psi^{'}_{N'}|} \> d\mu \\ &= \int{|f^{+}-\psi_{N}|+|-1||f^{-} - \psi^{'}_{N'}|} \> d\mu \\ &=\int{|f^{+}-\psi_{N}|+|f^{-} - \psi^{'}_{N'}|} \> d\mu \\ &= \int{f^{+}-\psi_{N}} \> d\mu +\int{f^{-} - \psi^{'}_{N'}} \> d\mu \\ &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.  \end{align} The proof is complete.","['measure-theory', 'solution-verification']"

My try $d(f(x),g(x))<2$ for all $x\in X$, implies that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not antipodal for all $x \in X$, hence there is a unique shortest path (geodesic) between them, denote this path by $C_x$. $C_x$ can be thought of as an arc with central angle $\theta_x<\pi$. for each $x \in X$, there is a copy of complex plane $\mathbb{C_x}$ which contains the arc $C_x$, hence we can define a map $H:X\times I \to S^2$ by $$H(x,t)=f(x)e^{it\theta_x}$$

I want to say that $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$ but they ask me to prove this later on in the question so I think it's something they don't want me to assume. If $|A| = n$ and $|B| = 1 \Rightarrow |A \cup B| = n+1$ which is finite. Therefore true for $|B| = 1$ This seems obvious using Venn diagrams but I can't think of a way to do this step algebraically without assuming that $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$ Assume true for $|B| = k$ i.e. $|A \cup B| = x = $ finite Prove true for $|B| = k + 1$ Assuming $A$ stays the same size and as $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, this implies that $|A \cup B| = x+1 =$ finite. Again, I'm assuming that $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$ Therefore if true for $|B| = k$ true for $|B| = k+1$. Since true for $|B| = 1$ true for $|B| \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ If I carried out the same induction but saying $|A|$ instead of $|B|$ I'd get the same results so it's also true for $|A| \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ I feel this isn't rigorous enough and I don't think I should be using $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$ but I'm not too sure how to tackle this.

& \Rightarrow & |Y| \le |X|, \text{ pigeonhole principle } \end{align}$ I'm also stuck here. Similar to 3, I think I need to conclude $|Y|>|X|$ from $(2)$ to get a contradiction. Can I please get some help to complete steps 3 and 4?","['pigeonhole-principle', 'proof-writing', 'functions']"

882762,Show that the graph of $y=x^3\sin(\pi/x)$ extends to a smooth arc,"Here's the problem: Let $y(x)$ be a real-valued function defined on the interval $x\in [0,1]$ by means of the equation
  $$y(x)= \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
       x^3\sin(\frac{\pi}{x}) \;\;\;\mathbb{for}  & x \in (0,1]
       \\0 \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mathbb{for} & x=0
       \end{array}
   \right.$$ (a) Show that $z=x+iy(x)$ represent an arc $C$ that intersects the real axis at points $z=\frac{1}{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$, and $z=0$ (b) Verify that the arc $C$ in part (a) is, in fact, a smooth arc. Okay so I figured out part (a). Now, I think I figured out part (b), but am not sure if my logic was valid. Here's the work: Attempted work for (b) In order for an arc to be smooth , $z'$ must be continuous on $[a,b]$ and non-zero on $(a,b)$. Since $z=x+iy(x)$, differentiating our result on $(0,1]$ will give us 
  $$z'=1+i(3x^2\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})-\pi x\cos(\frac{\pi}{x}))$$ 
  Clearly, $x'$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and non-zero on $(0,1)$ since any value we plug in will just give us $1$. $y'(x)$ is clearly defined for all values NOT $0$, so it is certainly continuous on $(0,1]$. Further, because of the relation between cosine and sine, it follows that $y'$ is non-zero on $(0,1)$ since sine and cosine will never be $0$ at the same time. We wish to show that $y'$ is continuous at $0$. Suppose that $y' \to 0$ when $x \to 0$. Then given $\epsilon >0$, we wish to show $\exists \delta >0$ s.t $\forall x \in (0,1]$ and 
  $$|x-0|<\delta \implies |3x^2\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})-\pi x\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})-0|<\epsilon$$
  Observe that since $|sin(x)| \leq 1$, $|cos(x)| \leq 1$, we can extend this to $|sin(\frac{\pi}{x})|,|cos(\frac{\pi}{x})|$. Thus, observe that
  $$|3x^2\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})-\pi x\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})| \leq |3x^2\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})|+|-\pi x\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})-0| \leq |3x^2|+\pi|x|$$
  Since $x>0$, it follows that
  $$|3x^2|+\pi|x| = 3x^2+\pi x < 3x^2 + 4x = 3x(x+\frac{4}{3})<\epsilon$$
  $$\impliedby 3x < \frac{\epsilon}{x+\frac{4}{3}}$$
  And since $x \leq 1$,
  $$\frac{\epsilon}{x+\frac{4}{3}} \leq \frac{\epsilon}{1+\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{3\epsilon}{7}$$
  so
  $$3x<\frac{3\epsilon}{7} \impliedby x=|x-0|< \frac{\epsilon}{7} = \delta$$
  Thus, given $\epsilon >0$, $\exists \delta=\frac{\epsilon}{7}$ s.t $\forall x\in (0,1]$ and
  $$|x-0|<\frac{\epsilon}{7} \implies |3x^2\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})-\pi x\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})-0|<\epsilon$$
  It is clear that $y'(x)$ is continuous at $0$. So $y'(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ $\implies$ our arc is smooth. So my question: was what I did valid in the proof? Or did I pull some strings that shouldn't have been pulled?","['continuity', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

882807,Which $f \in L^\infty$ are the Fourier transform of a bounded complex measure?,"A measure on $\mathbb R$ is a set function $\mu,$ defined for all Borel sets of $\mathbb R,$ which is countably additive(that is, $\mu(E)=\sum \mu(E_{i})$ if $E$ is the union of the countable family $\{E_{i}\}$ of pairwise disjoint Borel sets of $\mathbb R$), and for which $\mu(E)$ is finite if the closure of $E$ is compact. With each $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$ there is associated a set function $|\mu|,$ the total variation of $\mu,$ defined by,
$$|\mu|(E)= \sup \sum |\mu(E_{i})|,$$

882834,How do you test if the observed data have the same mean?,"This seems like it should be straightforward but I am at a loss. How does one test the following hypothesis: the observed data have the same mean (or, alternatively, the observed data have the same variance)? To provide context, I read the following online: ""Here's another way of getting at whether there's a real pattern: How much variation in the standard deviations would you expect if all the players had the same underlying standard deviation (and the observed differences were just a result of sampling)?""  It then occurred to me that I did not know what statistical test to run to confirm this.  That is, if I have a set of numbers, how do I determine if observed differences between the numbers are the result of sampling uncertainty or if such differences are the result of variance in individual-specific means.  Or is this impossible and the question is not well-specified.  It would seem to me that if the observed sample were bi-modal or clustered around two points, for example, one could conclude that there are two population means generating the data, with observations clustered around these two points according to sampling uncertainty.  But how does one draw such a conclusion more rigorously. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.","['statistics', 'hypothesis-testing']"
