6897,Archimedian field $K$ has LUB property iff it's complete requires DC?,"The Setting Let $K$ be an Archimedean field . TFAE: $K$ has the least upper bound property. Every Cauchy sequence in $K$'s additive group converges. Now proving that 1 implies 2 is easy, but the other direction is slightly harder. Not that that's a problem. Rather the problem is that I can't see a route that doesn't invoke at least dependent choice at some point. Strategy 1 Starting with a nonempty set $A$ that's bounded above, you could construct a monotonely non-decreasing Cauchy sequence of upper bounds that has the supremum as its limit. Here's a short sketch: Pick an upper bound $B_0$ of $A$. Pick an $a_0 \in A$. Recursively define
$$ B_{i+1} = \begin{cases}
\frac{B_i+a_i}{2}, & \text{ if that's an upper bound for } A \\
B_i,                & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases} $$
and
$$ a_{i+1} = \begin{cases}
a_i,  & \text{ if $\tfrac{a_i+B_i}{2}$ is an upper bound for $A$}\\
\text{choose any } a \in A \text{ s.t. } \frac{a_i+B_i}{2} < a,  & \text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases} $$
I can't see a way to get rid of the choice because you really want the $a_i$ to be in $A$ for the argument to go through. Strategy 2 Okay, let's go the long way instead! First we show that $K$ complete implies $[a,b]$ compact. Then we show that that implies that closed and bounded subsets are compact (""Heine-Borel property""). And finally we show that not(Heine-Borel property) implies not(least upper bound property). But I already get stumped on the first part. Clearly it's easy to show that $K$ complete implies $[a,b]$ is sequentially compact. And from here it'd be nice to use that $K$ is 2nd countable (the intervals with rational endpoints are a basis) to get that $[a,b]$ is in fact compact. So you start with an open covering $U_\alpha$ of $[a,b]$. 2nd countable spaces are Lindelöf... wait... let's make sure and prove that. Let $\{B_i\}$ be a countable basis. Then for each $B_i$ you choose a $U_\alpha$... oh. Choice crept up again. So my question is this: Does this really require (an admittedly weak form of) choice? Or is there a way to do without?",['real-analysis']

\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^{x}}} =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{x\log(x)}{4\sqrt{2}} -\frac{x^{2}\log^{2}(x)}{32\sqrt{2}}+ \frac{5x^{3}\log^{3}(x)}{384\sqrt{2}}\\\

Even though it has been a long time since I finished school, I remember this puzzle quite well, and I don't have a nice solution to it. So here is the puzzle: The triangle $ABC$ is known to be isosceles, that is, $AC=BC$. The labelled angles are known to be $\alpha=\gamma=20°$, $\beta=30°$. The task is to find the angle labelled ""?"". The only solution that I know of is to use the sine formula and cosine formula several times. From this one can obtain a numerical solution. Moreover this number can be algebraically shown to be correct (all sines and cosines are contained in the real subfield of the 36th cyclotomic field). So in this sense I solved the problem, but the solution is kind of a brute force attack (for example, some of the polynomials that show up in the computation have coefficients > 1000000). Since the puzzle originates from a book that deals only with elemetary geometry (and not even trigonometry if I remember correctly) there has to be a more elegant solution.","['faq', 'geometry', 'puzzle', 'triangles']"

Then (using the disk method) the volume is $$\int_a^b \pi f(x)^2 dx$$ since we approximate a little piece as a cylinder.  However, if we want to find the surface area, then we approximate it as part of a cone and the formula is $$\int_a^b 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2} dx.$$  But if approximated it by a circle with thickness $dx$ we would get $$\int_a^b 2\pi f(x) dx.$$ So my question is how come for volume we can make the cruder approximation of a disk but for surface area we can't.","['area', 'calculus', 'integration', 'volume']"

7034,"Prove that the sequence$ c_1 = 1$, $c_{n+1} = 4/(1 + 5c_n) $ , $ n \geq 1$ is convergent and find its limit","Prove that the sequence $c_{1} = 1$, $c_{(n+1)}= 4/(1 + 5c_{n})$     , $n \geq 1$  is convergent and find its limit. Ok so up to now I've worked out a couple of things. $c_1 = 1$ $c_2 = 2/3$ $c_3 = 12/13$ $c_4 = 52/73$ So the odd $c_n$ are decreasing and the even $c_n$ are increasing.  Intuitively, it's clear the the two sequences for odd and even $c_n$ are decreasing/increasing less and less.
Therefore it seems like the sequence may converge to some limit $L$. If the sequence has a limit, let $L=\underset{n\rightarrow \infty }{\lim }a_{n}.$   Then $L = 1/(1+5L).$
So we yield $L = 4/5$ and $L = -1$.  But since the even sequence is increasing and >0, then $L$ must be $4/5$. Ok, here I am stuck.  I'm not sure how to go ahead and show that the sequence converges to this limit (I tried using the definition of the limit but I didn't manage) and and not sure about the separate sequences how I would go about showing their limits.

7195,On deriving the arclength of a hyperbola,"In my attempts to derive the closed form for the arclength of the hyperbola, I wound up with the following integral: $$\int\frac{\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2 u}}{\sin^2 u}\mathrm{d}u$$ I am aware that such integrals are expressible as combinations of elliptic integrals and trigonometric functions, and Mathematica does return a result containing elliptic integrals. However, the result I got from Mathematica seems to suggest that the original integrand was split like so: $$\frac{\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2 u}}{\sin^2 u}=\frac{1-m}{\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2 u}}-\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2 u}+\frac{\csc^2u-m\;\sin^2 u}{\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2 u}}$$ and then integrated to yield the expression containing the elliptic integrals. What I'm stuck with is how this splitting was thought of so that the final integral is expressible in terms of the Legendre elliptic integrals. A possible clue lay in the fact that through an appropriate substitution, the original integral can be expressed as $$\int\mathrm{ds}^2(v|m)\mathrm{d}v$$ where $\mathrm{ds}(v|m)=\frac{\mathrm{dn}(v|m)}{\mathrm{sn}(v|m)}$ is a Jacobian elliptic function, from which this formula applies. However, I don't know how the formula listed in the DLMF was derived, and I suspect that the answer to my question will also explain that formula. I would appreciate any help in understanding why the integrand was split in that manner. Update : Trivially, $$\mathrm{ds}^2(v|m)=\mathrm{ns}^2(v|m)-m=1-m+\mathrm{cs}^2(v|m)$$ The elliptic integral of the second kind is supposed to arise due to the fact that $$\int\mathrm{dn}^2(v|m)\mathrm{d}v$$ $$=\int\mathrm{dn}(v|m)\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{am}(v|m))$$ $$=\int\sqrt{1-m\;\mathrm{sn}^2(v|m)}\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{am}(v|m))$$ $$=\int\sqrt{1-m\;\sin^2(\mathrm{am}(v|m))}\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{am}(v|m))$$ $$=E(\mathrm{am}(v|m)|m)$$ so I suppose figuring out how to integrate the squares of any of $\mathrm{cs}$, $\mathrm{ns}$, or $\mathrm{ds}$ would do the trick. I suspect something like integration by parts or tricks similar to those used for integrating ratios of trigonometric functions would work here, but I can't seem to find the proper strategy. Yet another way would be to show that $$-\int\left(\mathrm{cs}^2(v|m)+\mathrm{dn}^2(v|m)\right)\mathrm{d}v=\mathrm{cs}(v|m)\mathrm{dn}(v|m)$$ Differentiating the RHS gives the integrand, but supposing I did not know this expression, how would this integral be evaluated?","['special-functions', 'conic-sections', 'plane-curves', 'calculus']"

The function defined by $[f](x) =$ ""Lebesgue mean of $f$ at $x$"" is equal to $f$ almost everywhere so integrals of it will be equal to integrals of $f$, call this property $P$. Starting with the interval $[0,1]$ and removing the middle $1/4$ then the two middle $1/8$-ths then the four middle $1/16$-ths and so on produces the fat Cantor set which has measure $1/2$ but does not contain any interval (Since measures are countably additive this informs us that the set contains uncountably many points). Let $I$ be the indicator function for the fat Cantor set - it is equal to $1$ when applied on a point of the set and $0$ otherwise. Intuitively I would have thought that the Lebesgue mean $[I]$ of the indicator for the fat Cantor set would be the zero function. Since that contradicts $P$, it seems more plausible that $[I] = I$ but I cannot prove this. How can we construct the function $[I]$?","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

$f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{2n}{c_i x^i}$ where $c_i \in \mathbb{N}$ The goal is to determine if the coefficient in the middle, $c_n$, is nonzero or not. For example, we could be given $f(x) = \frac{1 - 10x^9 + 9x^{10}}{(x - 1)^2}$, which represents $1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + 9x^8$.  We are interested, in this case, in the middle coefficient, which happens to be 5. Original Formulation The actual value can be determined by evaluating a contour integral.  This is accomplished by first multiplying $f(x)$ by $x^{-n}$.  Then, rewriting the variable $x$ as $x\cdot e^{i t}$ and finally evaluating the integral $\int_C{f(x)dt}$.  The result of all of this is the coefficient in question. The Goal I seek to find alternative formulations to this problem.  Let me give some examples. Example 1 : ""Tiling"" Start with the original formula $f(x)$.  Make a copy, for example $f(y)$, by rewriting $x$ as $y$.  Then we can subtract the second function from the first, eliminating the first coefficient.  We repeat additions and subtractions (possibly infinitely many times) until all coefficients except for the middle one have been eliminated. Example 2 : ""Division"" We multiply $f(x)$ by a function $g(y)$, where $g(y) = \frac{1}{1-x^{2n+1}}$, essentially making the series repeat forever.  We then divide this by $x^n\cdot g(y)$, and get the remainder.  This remainder is the first half of the original series, and $c_n$ can be easily obtained from this. What is desired / Motivations I'd simply like to have alternative formulations for the solution.  I'm using this for an algorithm, and I'd like to publish this with anyone who gives a formulation that provides a quick result.","['complex-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'big-list', 'soft-question']"

7412,variant on Sierpinski carpet: rescue the tablecloth!,"I was playing around with Sierpinski carpets (see pretty GPU-produced picture here ), and came up with a variation that I have been unable to find mentioned elsewhere. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me an existing name for it, and help me determine where it fits into existing classifications of fractals. As you probably know, The construction of the Sierpinski
  carpet begins with a square. The
  square is cut into 9 congruent
  subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the
  [open] central subsquare is removed. The same
  procedure is then applied recursively
  to the remaining 8 subsquares, ad
  infinitum. In this variation, instead of merely removing the central subsquare, we recursively apply the same procedure to it ""inversely."" (Is there a better term for that?) That is, we treat the central hole as if we want to replace it with the complement of [this variant of] a Sierpinski carpet. So when we recur on the central hole, we put an ""anti-hole"" (like a ""donut hole"" without a donut) in the middle of it. We will then recur on the anti-hole using the normal (positive) procedure, and recur on the 8 subsquares surrounding the anti-hole using the inverse procedure. It looks something like this, in its 5th iteration: If you think I should post the code for this, I'm happy to, but I didn't think it was very relevant to the math question. I've been calling it ""Sierpinski tablecloth"" since I couldn't find another name for it, and because it reminds me of a lace or crocheted tablecloth design. Correction: @Rahul pointed out that ""the limiting set of the recursive process does not exist."" This is because the central point of the unit square must be part of both the tablecloth and its complement, or neither - which is impossible. (Of course we can still do finite iterations of the constructive process without hitting a contradiction.) To fix this problem, I tried proposing that we define the tablecloth set T (arbitrarily) to include the central point. The central subsquare is replaced with the union of the central point with the scaled-down complement of T. As before, the subsquares around the center are replaced with scaled-down copies of T (and therefore the central point of each of the subsquares is contained in T). Another update: Unfortunately the same problem is true of any point with an irrational coordinate, and of many rational ones. If we express the coordinates in base 3, as with the Cantor set, a point is a member of T iff the number of 1's in the base-3 expansion of each of its coordinates is even. But this doesn't work for numbers with repeating 1's. If we tried to fix this by making all ""problem points"" belong to T, we'd be left with ""almost"" a solid unit square, minus a ""dust"" of rational points with an even number of 1's in their base-3 coordinate expansions. Then T would cease to generate interesting fractal pictures (in the limit). Its area would be 1, like the irrationals$^2$. It's not clear to me that T would be different from the set of the irrationals$^2$ in any interesting way. Mind you, we can still draw pictures of the nth iteration of the tablecloth that are fun to look at, but it loses a good deal of its bite if it doesn't exist as a fractal. Can you think of a way to save the tablecloth from extinction as a fractal? The rest of this question was written under the misapprehension that the tablecloth exists (is a well-defined set) in the limit. Fractal dimension The traditional carpet has Hausdorff dimension $log(8)/log(3) = ~1.8928$ derived from the fact that it takes 8 self-similar copies at reduction factor 1/3 to cover itself (see example for Sierpinski triangle ). In this vein I figure that the tablecloth takes 9 self-similar copies at reduction factor 1/3 to cover itself (no smaller copy will cover the middle mini-square), so it would have Hausdorff dimension $log(9)/log(3) = 2$ This would put it in the same company (in terms of Hausdorff dimension) as space-filling curves like the Sierpinski curve, Hilbert, Peano, etc. Does this sound reasonable so far? I'm not quite comfortable with that, though, because a 1/3-size copy of the tablecloth will not actually cover the whole middle subsquare. In fact I can't see how any finite number of reduced-size copies of the tablecloth would cover the whole middle subsquare. And if we say we need an infinite number, the Hausdorff dimension would be infinite. :-( As an alternative, I considered multifractals , since we seem to have different scaling behavior occurring in different parts of the attractor. But that's deeper water than I'm prepared to wade into. Can anyone point me to literature on
fractals that are defined using complements of reduced-size self-similar sets (as well as the
usual reduced-size self-similar
sets)? Is that a class of fractals
that has been studied? (Update:) Or are such ""fractals"" doomed to
be ill-defined (self-contradictory) by their nature? Similarly to Hausdorff dimension, the box-counting dimension (using the criterion ""if the space were divided up into a grid of boxes of size ε, how many boxes of that scale would contain part of the attractor?"") also seems to end up at 2, for much the same reasons. And I'm more comfortable with it because a ""box"" (as opposed to a reduced copy of the tablecloth) will indeed cover the whole middle subsquare. It seems clear that in the limit, the box-counting dimension converges to 2, because there are no gaps, so every box, at whatever size ε, will always contain part of the fractal. In terms of area (standard Lebesgue measure ), I'm pretty sure that the tablecloth has zero, like the carpet, because it has no intervals (rectangles) that are entirely in the set. Right? ( Update: I stand corrected: the tablecloth seems to have area 1/2.) Summary There are several questions above, so to tie them all together: I'm wondering if this tablecloth variant is something new and interesting, or something well-known, or an unknown but trivial variant that can be classified under existing categories. E.g. if there is a variant of the Cantor set that is defined similarly to the tablecloth (for one dimension), I would appreciate a link to info about that. (Update:) One thing that seems interesting to me about it is that it has points in every interval of the unit square, but it also has holes in every interval. I guess it's like rational numbers in [0,1] in that regard, or like space-filling curves/trees, yet is not a curve or tree (not connected). I can't think of other fractals off-hand that are like that, can you? It seems that this property is connected with the fact that we recur on the inverse instead of leaving holes. P.S. I just read about the term mutually dense ( Interleaving Ad Infinitum ): 'If a set S with linear ordering O can be partitioned into two subsets
A and B such that between every two distinct elements of A is an 
element of B, and vice versa, then the sets A and B are said to be 
""mutually dense"".' So the tablecloth and its complement are mutually dense, assuming that this term can be generalized to the unit square. At least in any horizontal or vertical linear slice of the unit square, they are mutually dense.","['general-topology', 'fractals']"

Also $E[X] = \frac{r(1-p)}{p}$ and $\text{Var}[X] = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}$. So is the geomtric distribution really a special case of the negative binomial?

7446,"Is ""locally linear"" an appropriate description of a differentiable function?","In this answer on meta , Pete L. Clark said: I think the question concerns the idea that a differentiable curve becomes more and more like a straight line segment the closer one zooms in on its graph. (And I must say that I regard part of this confusion as an artifact of badly written recent calculus books who describe this phenomenon as ""local linearity"". Ugh!) So, what's wrong with calling it ""local linearity""?  (Examples of the specific language from some relatively recent books follow.) From Finney, Demana, Waits, and Kennedy's Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic , 1st ed, p107: A good way to think of differentiable functions is that they are locally linear; that is, a function that is differentiable at a closely resembles its own tangent line very close to a . From Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al's Calculus: Single Variable , 2nd ed, pp138-9: When we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function, it looks like a straight line.  In fact, the graph is not exactly a straight line when we zoom in; however, its deviation from straightness is so small that it can't be detected by the naked eye. Following that, there is discussion of the tangent line approximation, then a theorem titled ""Differentiability and Local Linearity"" (the first time ""local linearity""/""locally linear"" appears) stating that if a function f is differentiable at a , then the limit as x goes to a of the quotient of the error in the tangent line approximation and the difference between x and a goes to 0. Ostebee and Zorn's Calculus from Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View , 1st ed, p110: Remarkably, the just-illustrated strategy of zooming in to estimate slope almost always works.  Zooming in on the graph of almost any calculus function $f$, at almost any point $(a,f(a))$, eventually produces what looks like a straight line with slope $f'(a)$.  A function with this property is sometimes called locally linear (or locally straight ) at $x=a$. [Margin note: These aren't formal definitions, just descriptive phrases. ]  Local linearity says, in effect, that $f$ ""looks like a line"" near $x=a$ and therefore has a well-defined slope at $x=a$. (I did not find the term ""local linearity"" or ""locally linear"" at a quick glance in Stewart's Calculus: Concepts and Contexts , 2nd ed, or Leithold's The Calculus 7 ; the rest of the calculus books I have on hand predate the inclusion of graphing calculators/software in textbooks, so are not suitable for comparison.)","['education', 'calculus']"
