2413609,Ideas on approaching the integral $\int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{artanh} x}{x} \mathrm d x$,"I stumbled across this integral while trying to prove, $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac 1 {(2n + 1)^2} = \frac{\pi^2} 8 $, a brief sketch of my method being, $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac 1 {(2n + 1)^2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_0^1 x^{2n} \mathrm dx \int_0^1 y^{2n} \mathrm dy = \int_0^1 \int_0^1\sum_{n=0}^\infty (x^2 y^2)^n \mathrm d x \mathrm d y = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac 1 {1 - x^2y^2}\mathrm d x \mathrm d y = \frac 1 2 \int_0^1 \frac 1 {x} \log\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) \mathrm dx = \int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{artanh}(x)} x \mathrm d x$ Obviously, there's no elementary antiderivative, and I don't think using Wolfram to calculate dilogs would constitute a nice proof.

2413619,The complete extension of a probability is not unique,"The context is as follows: a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{B}, \mathbb{P})$ has a complete extension $(\Omega,\mathcal{B}_1, \mathbb{P}_1)$ if $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{B}_1$ and $\mathbb{P}_1\rvert_\mathcal{B} = \mathbb{P}$. I know that such extension exists: if $\mathcal{N}$ is the set of $\mathbb{P}$-negligible sets, then $\mathcal{B}^\ast = \{B \cup N : B \in \mathcal{B}, N\in\mathcal{N}\}$ and $\mathbb{P}^\ast(B\cup N) = \mathbb{P}(B)$ is a complete extension (moreover, it is the minimal extension). I need to prove that such extension may not be unique; that is, if $(\Omega,\mathcal{B}_2, \mathbb{P}_2)$ is another complete extension, then $\mathbb{P}_1$ and $\mathbb{P}_2$ may not agree on $\mathcal{B}_1\cap \mathcal{B}_2$. A hint provided says that it should suffice to suppose that $\Omega$ has a small number of points. I first tried to set $\Omega = \{a,b,c\}$, $\mathcal{B} = \{\emptyset, \Omega, \{a\}, \{b,c\}\}$ and $\mathbb{P}(\{a\}) = 1$, $\mathbb{P}(\{b,c\}) = 0$, but the completion is $\mathcal{B}^\ast = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ (and since it is minimal, I ""ran out"" of $\sigma$-algebras). Then I tried with $\Omega = \{a,b,c,d\}$, $\mathcal{B} = \{\emptyset, \Omega, \{a,b\}, \{c,d\}\}$ and $\mathbb{P}(\{a,b\}) = 0$, $\mathbb{P}(\{c,d\}) = 1$. Clearly this $\sigma$-algebra is not complete, since $\{a\}$ and $\{b\}$ are $\mathbb{P}$-negligible, but not null. So, one complete extension could be the minimal one. But I don't see how can I build the other extension; in particular, I don't see how to construct a second probability measure to be an extension. Any hint or help will be appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
2413643,The general linear group is closed,"In algebraic geometry I learned that $GL(n, \mathbb R)$ is Zariski-closed (every linear algebraic group is a closed subgroup of it, and it is itself linear algebraic), and as the Zariski topology is coarser than the usual topology it must be closed in the standard topology, but by the defining condition $\det(A) \ne 0$ it is open as well, which is not possible in the standard topology, as this space is connected.

2413683,Estimate Gamma distribution using central limit theorem,"The random variable X has a Gamma distribution with parameters $ \alpha$ = na, and $ \beta$ = b , $a, b > 0$, and n a natural number different from zero.
What is the probability that X is strictly greater than $(n+1)ab$ for n big enough ? i start with: $$ X_i > (n+1)ab$$
so: $$X_i -nab > ab $$ now divide by standard deviation of Gamma distribution:$$\frac{X_i -nab}{\sqrt {nab^2} } > \frac{a}{\sqrt {na}} $$ and now take the sum over all $X_i$'s: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{X_i -nab}{\sqrt {nab^2} } > \frac{na}{\sqrt {na}} $$ and for last i multiply $ \frac{1}{\sqrt n}$ with the term above: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt n}\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{X_i -nab}{\sqrt {nab^2} } > \frac{na}{\sqrt {a}n} $$ or equivalently:$$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{X_i -nab}{\sqrt {a} nb } > \frac{a}{\sqrt {a}} $$ so i get exactly the structure of central limit theorem by manipulating the fact that $X_i > (n+1)ab$ that says it is equal to standard normal distribution the left hand side is now standard normal distributed , but clearly i make a mistake some where but i don't see it!

2413684,Is there a sense in which the Chi-squared distribution is an inner product?,"I have been self-studying statistics recently, and the apparent similarities between linear algebra (especially Hilbert spaces ) and statistics have been popping out to me. Linear independence gets replaced with statistical independence . The mean is like an origin to which random variables can be translated to change from an affine space into a vector space . The covariance is basically just an inner product . At first I thought that these similarities might be coincidental, but after a lot of research, it became clear that they are not. There appears to be quite a lot of literature on this topic, but I have not yet studied this relationship very closely and am in the process of finding a textbook to read. That said, based on the research that I have done so far, there is still one connection to vectors that has not been discussed anywhere I've looked: the Chi-Squared distribution . Given the analogies described above, it seems obvious that the analogy for independent , standard normal random variables of the form $$X=\frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}, \ \ Y=\frac{x-\mu_y}{\sigma_y}, \text{ etc.}
$$ would be orthogonal unit vectors . With this understanding, one might construct a ""random variable vector"" ( $\chi$ ) of the form $${\large \chi}(a,b,c) = aX+bY+cZ= \pmatrix{a \\ b \\ c}
$$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constant, real-valued, and non-random. This vector is itself a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu_\chi=a\mu_x+b\mu_y+c\mu_z=0$ and variance $\sigma_\chi^2=a^2\sigma_x^2+b^2\sigma_y^2+c^2\sigma_z^2=a^2+b^2+c^2$. So far, it is obeying all of the analogical rules established above. That would lead naturally to the Chi-squared distribution $${\large \chi^2} =\pmatrix{1 & 1 & 1} \pmatrix{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}=X^2+Y^2+Z^2
$$ which is not a ""vector"" (as expected). However, it is not clear to me how to interpret its meaning - especially its mean (in this case, $\mu_{\chi^2}=3$) or variance (in this case, $\sigma_{\chi^2}^2=6$). So I have 3 inter-related questions: 1) Does it make sense to interpret independent, standard normal random variables as being akin to ""orthogonal unit vectors""? 2) If it does, is there any meaning or utility in constructing a ""random variable vector"" as described above? If there is not, is there another way to construct a random variable vector that is meaningful? 3) Finally, is there any sense in which the Chi-squared distribution can be seen as an inner product between a ""random variable vector"" and itself? Can that inner product be generalized to be between different vectors? Can it be used to construct a ""norm"" on this space (say, with the Chi distribution )? If so, what exactly does that mean? Note: I know that this is a question from ignorance built on possibly tenuous analogies. Since I am self-studying, I can't help but draw connections between this new material and the sort of math that I am already comfortable with. If there is any way that I can improve this question, please let me know.","['self-learning', 'hilbert-spaces', 'statistics', 'linear-algebra', 'random-variables']"
2413692,Why do you require connection in the open mapping theorem and maximum modulus principle?,"I cannot understand why we require the connection in these two theorems (or at least I've been taught this way, and also in some books you have it). The first states that every non-constant analytic function defined from an open and connected subset $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ is open. The second says that if the norm of an analytic function defined in an open and connected subset $U$ of the complex plane has a real maximum in a point internal to $U$, then the function is constant. I'll try to prove these two theorems without using connection (or maybe I use that without realising). First, I want to prove that for every  analytic function $f$ defined in an open subset $U$ such that $f(z) \ne 0 \forall z \in U$ and $\forall n$ positive integers, there is an analytic function $g$ such that $f(z)=g(z)^{n}$.(Here the teacher supposed $U$ to be connected or maybe even simply connected, it isn't clear in my notes). You just have to consider a primitive $F$ of $\frac{f'}{f}$ and than it is easy to verify that $e^{(F(z)-c)/n}$ for some constant $c$ works. The only thing here that I'm not sure about (and it's where I think the problem is) is that I don't know if I can consider that primitive $F$. I don't see why I shouldn't though, as $f$ is uniquely representable by a power series in balls contained in $U$, and so I should also be able to define a primitive of $f$ locally. Ok, so let's try to prove the open mapping theorem To prove that, you suppose $0 \in U$, consider an open ball $B$ contained in $U$ and require $f(0)=0$ (it shouldn't change anything, it's just translations). $f(z)=z^{k}g(z)$, where $k$ is the order of $f$, that is the minimum integer for which the coefficent of $z^k$ isn't 0. Then you have $g(z)$ an holomorpic function in $B$ such that $g(0) \ne 0$. By continuity, there is an open neighborhood  where $g$ is never 0. Using the result proven above, I can write $g(z)=(h(z))^{k}$, and so $f(z)=(zh(z))^k$. You can verify that $(zh)'(0) \ne 0$ and then using the inverse function theorem and the fact that $z \to z^k$ is an open mapping, you conclude. The second theorem is now trivial, as for every point $a$ in the internal part of $U$ you can send an open neighborhood of $a$ in an open neighborhood of $f(a)$, and so  $f(a)$ cannot be a maximum. I don't see why these proofs shouldn't work, or where I've used unconsiously the connection. thanks for the help.","['analyticity', 'complex-analysis', 'analytic-functions', 'holomorphic-functions']"

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $A$, $B$ denote subsets of a (topological) space $X$. Determine whether the following equation holds; if an equality fails, determine whether one of the inclusions $\subset$ or $\supset$ holds. 
  $$ \overline{A-B} = \overline{A} - \overline{B}. $$ My Attempt: In the space  $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, let $A$ denote the set of all rational numbers, and let $B$ denote the set of all irrational numbers. Then we note that $$\overline{A} = \mathbb{R} = \overline{B},$$ and also

2413790,Decomposition of a morphism into an epi- and a monomorphism,"Let $\varphi: G \to H$ be a homomorphism. Show that there exists an group $X$, an epimorphism $\psi:G \to X$ and monomorphism $\chi: X \to H$ such that $\varphi = \chi \circ \psi$. The textbook approach The first isomorphism theorem makes this easy enough. Lets define $X$ as $G/\text{ker}(\varphi)$ and $\psi: G \to X; g \mapsto g\cdot \text{ker}(\varphi)$. Since $\psi$ is the canonical surjection it is clearly surjective. Then let $\chi: X \to H; g\cdot \text{ker}(\phi) \to g^\varphi$ which is by definition injective. Why not? But what is wrong with: Let $X = \text{im}(\varphi) \leq H$ then $\psi: G \to X; g\mapsto g^\varphi$ which is by definition surjective and by definition an morphism (since $\varphi$ is a morphism) and then let $\chi: X \to H; x\mapsto x$. the boring identity function. Which is an injective morphism as well. Something must be wrong with the second approach, but I don't see what...

2413794,Questions on the $n$-transitivity of $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$.,"Recently, I tried to understand how to proof the $n$-transitivity of $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ acting on a smooth connected manifold $M$. I found a proof here $n$-transitivity of $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ acting on a smooth manifold $M$ and another article on researchgate which follows the same ideas. However, I still have questions because of some details. How do we prove that we actually can have disjoint embedded curves? What are the hypothesis that we need to prove it? Because in one dimension it is obvious that it doesn't work. Both references take dim $\geq$ 2. But in two dimensions the closed unit disk is also a counterexample if we take points on the boundary (for example $(-1;0) \mapsto (1;0)$ and $(0;-1) \mapsto (0;1)$). So, do we have to add that $M$ is without boundary in our hypothesis? If we suppose those two, what's the proof of that? It doesn't seem elementary... (Or it is?) We took $(x_1, ... x_n)$ to be disctincts points, such as $(y_1, ..., y_n)$. But we need that both sets doesn't share common elements, isn't it? I think it is necessary for the proof, but maybe it is just a misunderstanding on my part of the defintion of $n$-transitivity.",['differential-geometry']

2413899,Proof of circle bisecting method,"When I was 7 or 8 years old, I was playing with drawing circles. For some reason, I thought about taking a 90° angle and placing the vertex on the circle and marking where the two sides intersected the circle. It appeared to me that connecting the two points of intersection created a line through the center regardless of how the square was rotated. I tested this many times and, within the error my tools, my conjecture seemed to be correct. I had indeed discovered a method for finding the center of a circle. Simply create at least two of these bisecting lines and voila! The problem I have now, many years later, is that I am not satisfied with simply checking a bunch of times; I want a proof. I can intuitively explain two extremes and the middle without any fancy math, but I still have not come up with a general proof. As one of the points of intersection approaches the vertex of the angle, the leg with that point approaches a tangent of the circle. It is intuitive to me that a line, which is perpendicular to a tangent line and passes through the point at which the tangent line touches the circle, would bisect the circle. In addition, when the angle is rotated such that the two line segments formed between the vertex and the points of intersection are equal, these line segments form half of an inscribed square. A line that passes through two opposite vertices of that square would also bisect the circle. Can you prove whether placing the vertex of a 90° angle on a circle creates a bisector by connecting the points of intersection?","['circles', 'angle', 'geometry']"

2414319,What's the degree of $\binom{x}{k}$?,"Consider $\binom{x}{k}$, where $x$ is a positive integer variable and $0 \leq k \leq x$, where $k$ can be dependent on $x$. I'm interested in expanding $\binom{x}{k}$ in $x$. For 'small' values of $k$, this is just a polynomial in $x$ of degree $k$. For example: \begin{align*} \binom{x}{0} &= 1 &\text{ degree 0}\\
 \binom{x}{1} &= x &\text{ degree 1}\\
\binom{x}{2} &= \frac{x(x-1)}{2!} = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{2} x &\text{ degree 2}\\
 \binom{x}{3} &= \frac{x(x-1)(x-2)}{3!} = \frac{1}{6} x^3 - \frac{1}{2} x^2 + \frac{1}{3} x &\text{ degree 3}\\
\end{align*} However, as $k$ grows larger relative to $x$, this pattern no longer holds. As an extreme example, $\binom{x}{x-1} = x$ does not have degree $x-1$. Rather it has degree $1$, by the identity $\binom{x}{k} = \binom{x}{x-k}$ for all $k$. Similarly, $\binom{x}{x-2}$ has degree $2$. But when $k$ is not extremely small or extremely large relative to $x$, $\binom{x}{k}$ is more complicated. For, say, $\binom{x}{\lfloor x/2 \rfloor}$, it's unclear what its degree should be, or even if the function $x \mapsto \binom{x}{\lfloor x/2 \rfloor}$ is a polynomial in $x$ at all. In short, my question is: Let $x \in \Bbb Z^+$, and let $k : \Bbb Z^+ \to \Bbb Z^{\geq 0}$ be a function of $x$ such that $0 \leq k(x) \leq x$ for all $x$. Consider the function $f: \Bbb Z^+ \to \Bbb Z^{\geq 0}$ given by: $f : x \mapsto \binom{x}{k(x)}$. For which functions $k$ is $f$ a polynomial? If it is not always a polynomial, what sort of function is $f$? What I have shown in my post is: When $k$ is a constant function, then $f$ is a polynomial. But there exist non-constant functions $k$ for which $f$ is a polynomial, for example $k(x) = x-1$. I'm wondering whether other functions, such as $k(x) = \lfloor x/2 \rfloor$, also produce polynomials.","['polynomials', 'functions', 'elementary-number-theory']"

2414522,Pitchfork Bifurcation vs. Period-Doubling Bifurcation,"I'm trying to understand how symmetry transformations give us indication of what kind of bifurcation occurs in a particular system, and I'm currently following Ghrist et. al.'s monograph on Knots & Links in 3-D flows, which is a little sketchy at places. In particular, for pitchfork bifurcation he writes: Consider $f:\mathbb{R}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^1$ which is generic in the class of maps which is invariant under the symmetry transformation $x\mapsto -x$ e.g. $x\mapsto x + \mu x - x^3$. Then, by symmetry, the origin must be a fixed point for all $\mu$. In this case there is a pitchfork bifurcation at $\mu=0$. For the period-doubling bifurcation, he writes: Let $f_{\mu}:\mathbb{R}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^1$ be a generic map whose derivative satisfies $f'_0(0)=-1$, e.g. $x\mapsto - x - \mu x + x^3$. Then, the bifurcation at $\mu=0$ is called a period-doubling bifurcation. My questions:
1) I learnt about pitchfork bifurcation in the context of ODEs, where there were a bunch of other conditions necessary for a pitchfork bifurcation to take place, yet they aren't mentioned here. It's unclear to me why a generic real-valued map that is invariant under the symmetry transformation results in a pitchfork bifurcation when we vary the parameters. For instance, $g(x)=x$ is invariant under the symmetry transformation since $-x \mapsto -x = g(-x)$ 2) I don't really know what he means by symmetry transformation in this case. Does he mean that the function is odd? But in this case, isn't the period-doubling bifurcation also invariant under the symmetry transformation. For if,  $f(x) = - x - \mu x + x^3$, then $f(-x)= - (x -\mu x + x^3) = -f(x)$, no? Wouldn't that make it a pitchfork bifurcation under Ghrist's definition above? Yet that can't be right... I'm basically confused about how period-doubling transformations are symmetry breaking...

\end{equation} Physically, $x$ can be understood as the displacement of $n$ nodes of a spring-mass chain, fixed at one end (note that $K_{n,n}=1$, that's not a typo). This is what happens for an initial condition $x(0)=[0,\dots,0]$ and $\dot x(0)=[0,\dots,0,1]$, i.e. for a initial velocity of the mass at the end. It appears that there is something looking like a propagating wave (going to the left), with a constant velocity. Question How to estimate this apparent velocity as a function of $n$? Numerically, it is easy to estimate it, for example by plotting $(i,t,x_i(t))$ where $i\in \{ 1,\dots,n\}$, here for $n=100$: We can clearly see a straight line in the plot $(i,t)$. On the left of this line, $x$ is (almost) zero: there is no displacement (information has not reached these points yet). Note that the eigenvalues of $K$ are 
$$\omega_k=2\Big(1-\cos\Big(\dfrac{(2k-1)\pi}{2n+1}\Big)\Big)$$
and its eigenvectors are given by
$$\phi_k^{(i)}=\sin\Big(\dfrac{i(2k-1)\pi}{2n+1}\Big)$$
where $i$ is the component index and $k$ the index of the eigenvector. The ODE can be solved in the first order form, posing $y^\top = [x,\ \dot x]$: \begin{equation}
\dot y = Ay, \quad  A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & I \\ -K &  0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
so the solutions are $y(t)=\exp(tA)y(0)$.
The question reduces to ""extracting"" the apparent velocity from $\exp(At)e_{2n}$ ($e_{2n}$ is the last vector of the canonical basis) but I can't see how. Digging in that direction, we can show that with
$$q_i(t)=\dfrac{1}{\omega_i} \phi_i^{(n)} \sin(\omega_i t)$$ and $q^\top =[q_1,\dots,q_n]$,
the solution for the initial velocity $y=e_{2n}$ is

What i know so far is that there are examples of functions that satisfy the first property and doesn't satisfy the second ; the ones i know of are $f(x)=1$ if $x=2^k, k$ natural, and $0$ otherwise, and one more with $k!$ instead of $2^k$. Of course, it is easily shown that if the function doesn't satisfy the first property, it must satisfy the other one. This is a simplified version of the problem where instead of $\{0, 1\}$, the codomain of $f$ is $\{0, 1, ... n\}$ for some fixed $n$. This more general problem has came from an attempt to identify ( as many as possible ) the members of p-adic number system, where $p = n$ with complex values such that the set of numbers that can be identified in this way together with p-adic operations on them is isomorphic with the subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ that is made from elements they are identified with. So that was a little bit of background. The main purpose of it was to suggest a possible candidate for $f$ in a more general version of the problem. Let $n=7$, and $x$ be one of the solutions of the equation $x^2=2$ in $\mathbb{Q}_7$, obviously there are 2 solutions opposite to each other ( $x_1+x_2 = 0$ ), $f(k)$ is then the $k$-th digit in the representation of x in $\mathbb{Q}_7$. What i believe is that both solutions generate us a function that would satisfy both properties and that the values of analytic continuations of respective $g_1(z)$ and $g_2(z)$ at $z=7$ will be equal to $\sqrt{2}$ and $- \sqrt{2}$ respectively. Ty for reading until the end and thank you for any help on the topic, i am looking forward to read the answers","['complex-analysis', 'p-adic-number-theory']"
2414585,Inscribing rhombus in a triangle's angle in only eight compass-and-straightedge steps,"EUCLIDEA ANDROID PROBLEM 13.1 Here is a surprisingly intriguing challenge posed on the latest version of Euclidea, a mobile app for Euclidean constructions. The problem used to be considered easy when a nine-step solution was the shortest one known. However, an eight-step construction has just been found. The task is to find this record-breaking construction. Given $\Delta{ABC}$  with sides fully constructed ( figure below ). Goal Construct yellow rhombus $AC'A'B'$ in the figure in exactly eight elementary steps ('8E') , with $C' \in \overline{AB}$, $A' \in \overline{BC}$, and $B' \in \overline{AC}$. Clarifications All sides of the rhombus must be constructed to complete the construction. Only an unmarked straightedge and a non-rusty collapsible compass ( i.e. , a compass that, while on paper, can have any radius but which cannot maintain said radius when not on paper) can be used. Elementary steps are accounted for in the following way. Construct a point: 0 elementary steps (E). Mark the intersection of two curves with a point: 0E. Construct a new line (*or line segment or ray): 1E. Extend a given line segment (*or ray): 1E. Construct a circle (non-rusty collapsible compass): 1E. Construct the perpendicular bisector of a line segment: 3E. Construct a new line perpendicular to an old line: 3E. Hints from Euclidea (including Twitter support) A known 8E solution employs elementary steps in the order: circle, circle, line, line, circle, line, line, and line. Homothety is employed. It may be helpful to consider the dotted rhombus $AC''XB''$ shown in the figure. There is a claim that $X$, the vertex of the dotted rhombus opposite $A$, can be constructed in the first three moves (circle, circle, line). There is also a claim that similarity of isosceles triangles is important. Previous work Many of the hints come from my online interactions with Euclidea support on Twitter. I know the 9E solution: The first four steps construct the bisector $\overline{AX}$ of $\angle{BAC}$, $A'$ is the intersection of $\overline{AX}$ and $\overline{BC}$, Steps 5 to 7 perpendicularly bisect $\overline{AX}$ to define $B'$ and $C'$, and finally Steps 8 and 9 construct the remaining sides $\overline{A'B'}$ and $\overline{A'C'}$ of the desired rhombus. I am mystified by the two-fold claim that the first three steps of the 8E construction are (circle, circle, line) and can construct $X$. On one hand, I know a way to construct $X$ in the first three moves , but these moves are all circles. On the other hand, I know how to construct $\overleftrightarrow{CX}$ in the first four moves according to the Euclidea's hinted sequence of steps (circle, circle, line, line), but that construction does not define $X$ itself: Construct two circles through $C$, one centered at $A$ and another centered at $B$; construct the other  intersection $D$ of these two circles; construct diameter $\overleftrightarrow{AD}$ of the circle centered on $A$; construct that diameter's other intersection point $E$ with the circle centered on $A$, and construct $\overleftrightarrow{CE} = \overleftrightarrow{CX}$. SOLUTION 1 WITH PROOF: From @Aretino, who got the +50 bounty This solution maximizes the use of homothety. $A$ is defined as the homothetic center, and the desired 'yellow' rhombus is constructed by homothetic based on the 'dotted' rhombus with side length $AC$. A fundamental assumption is that the remaining vertices of the given triangle are labeled $B$ and $C$ such that $AC < BC$ . Merely to make the vertex labeling consistent with the given figure shown above, the triangle was first 'massaged' slightly such that its 'left' side was shorter than its 'right' one. Therefore, $B$ is the other 'bottom' vertex, while $C$ is the 'top' one. Construct circle $C(A)$ centered on $C$ with radius $CA$. [1E running total] Construct intersection point $D := \overline{BC} \cap C(A)$. [1E running total] Construct circle $B(D)$. [2E running total] Construct intersection point $E := \overline{AB} \cap B(D)$. [2E running total] Construct $\overleftrightarrow{DE}$. [3E running total] Construct the other intersection point $X := \overleftrightarrow{DE} \cap C(A)$. $X$ is a key point: the vertex opposite $A$ on the big, dotted rhombus in the given figure. [3E running total] Focus on circle $C(D) = C(X)$. $D$ and $X$ are both on this circle, so $\overline{CD} \cong \overline{CX}$ and $\Delta{CDX}$ is an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{DCX}$ are congruent: $\angle{CDX} \cong \angle{CXD}$. Next, focus on circle $B(D) = B(E)$. $D$ and $X$ are both on this other circle, so $\overline{BD} \cong \overline{BE}$ and $\Delta{DBE}$ is an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{DBE}$ are congruent: $\angle{BDE} \cong \angle{BED}$. Then, focus on $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{EX}$. These lines define a pair of vertical angles, which are by definition congruent: $\angle{CDX} \cong \angle{BDE}$. It follows from transitivity of congruence that $\angle{BED} \cong \angle{CXD}$. These congruent angles can be viewed as alternate interior angles defined by transversal $\overleftrightarrow{EX}$ and lines $\overleftrightarrow{CX}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{BE} = \overleftrightarrow{AE}$. Elements I.27 therefore dictates that $\overleftrightarrow{CX} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{AE}$. This parallelism, together with Elements I.29 , implies that $\angle{DCX} \cong \angle{DBE}$. Focus on circle $C(A) = C(X)$. $A$ and $X$ are both on this circle, so $\overline{AC} \cong \overline{CX}$. $\Delta{ACX}$ is thus an isosceles triangle. By the isosceles triangle theorem , the base angles of $\Delta{ACX}$ are congruent: $\angle{CAX} \cong \angle{CXA}$. Then, observe that $\Delta{ACX}$ has apex angle $\angle{ACX} = \angle{ACD} + \angle{DCX} = \angle{ACB} + \angle{DCX} = \angle{ACB} + \angle{DBE}$. That is, the measure of the apex angle $\angle{ACX}$ is the sum of the measures of $\angle{ABC}$ and $\angle{ACB}$, i.e. , the vertex angles in the given $\Delta{ABC}$. Therefore, the sum of the measures of the congruent angles $\angle{CAX}$ and $\angle{CXA}$ equals the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. In particular, $\angle{CAX}$ has half the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. $\angle{BAX}$ therefore also has half the measure of $\angle{CAB}$. In short, $\overleftrightarrow{AX}$ bisects $\angle{CAB}$. Given that $\overleftrightarrow{BE} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{AE}$, $\overline{AC} \cong \overline{CX}$, $\overleftrightarrow{AX}$ bisects $\angle{CAB}$, and that a rhombus is a parallelogram whose sides are congruent and (equivalently) whose diagonals bisect their respective vertex angles, conclude that the points $A$, $C$, and $X$ are vertices of a rhombus with sides of length $AC$ and where $A$ and $X$ are opposite each other. Construct $\overline{AX}$. [4E running total] Construct the other intersection point $A' := \overline{BC} \cap \overline{AX}$. $A'$ is the vertex opposite $A$ on the yellow rhombus to be constructed here. [4E running total] Set $A$ as the homothetic center for the dotted rhombus. By homothety, any straight line through $A$ will pass through 'corresponding' points on the dotted rhombus and the yellow rhombus. In particular, $\overline{AX}$ connects $X$ in the dotted rhombus with $A'$ in the yellow rhombus. But as proven above, $X$ is the vertex opposite $A$ in the dotted rhombus. It follows that $A'$ is the vertex opposite $A$ in the yellow rhombus. Construct circle $A'(D)$. [5E running total] Construct the other intersection point $F := \overleftrightarrow{DE} \cap A'(D)$. [5E running total] Construct $\overline{A'F}$. It is parallel to $\overline{AB}$ and intersects $\overline{AC}$ at a point $B'$ such that $\overline{A'B'} \cong 
\overline{AB'}$. [6E running total] Sketch of proof: $A'(D)$ plays the same role as $C(A)$ in Item 6, leading us to claim $\overline{A'B'} \parallel \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CX}$. The parallelism of $\overline{A'B'}$ with $\overline{CX}$ and the homothety from Item 8 mean that $\overline{A'B'}$ corresponds to $\overline{CX}$. The congruence between $\overline{CX}$ and $\overline{AC}$ must thus correspond to a congruence between $\overline{A'B'}$ and $\overline{AB'}$. Construct the intersection point $B' := \overline{A'F} \cap \overline{AC}$ [6E running total] . Construct $\overline{AD}$. [7E running total] Construct the other intersection point $G := \overline{AD} \cap A'(D)$. [7E running total] Construct $\overleftrightarrow{A'G}$.

The congruence between $\overline{BX}$ and $\overline{AB}$ must thus correspond to a congruence between $\overline{A'C'}$ and $\overline{AC'}$. SOLUTION 2 WITH PROOF: From me This solution is nearly identical to the one above from @Aretino in its dependence on homothety. In contrast to that one, however, this solution explicitly leverages the congruence of the sides of a rhombus. As before, $B$ and $C$ are picked such that $AC < BC$, and $B$ is the other 'bottom' vertex, while $C$ is the 'top' one. Construct circle $C(A)$ centered on $C$ with radius $CA$.

Show that for any bounded set $E$, there is a $G_\delta$ set $G$ for which $E \subseteq G$ and $m^*(G)=m^*(E)$. Proof: Let $\mathcal{A} := \{\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \mid \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \text{ covers } E \}$, and define $G = \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A$. Since $E \subseteq A$ for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$, we have that $E \subseteq G$, which in turn implies $m^*(E) \le m^*(G)$. Now let $\varepsilon > 0$. Then there exists a cover $\{I_{k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ such that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(I_k) \le m^*(E) + \varepsilon$. Notice that $\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \in \mathcal{A}$, so that $G \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$, and therefore $m^*(G) \le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(I_k) \le m^*(E) + \varepsilon$. Taking $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, we arrive at $m^*(G) \le m^*(E)$, and therefore $m^*(G) = m^*(E)$. First of all, does this seem right? Secondly, where is the boundedness assumption of $E$ used?

Wikipedia claims that every Polish space is regular conditional space and  I'm trying to prove it. I will treat space $M$ as a metric space with distance function $d$ providing complete metrization. My idea of the proof were Define RCPM on set on  the countable set of rational balls $\xrightarrow[]{(1)}$ Increase to the set of all Balls of $M$ by computing limits on sets of measure 1 $\xrightarrow[]{(2)}$ extend it to all the open sets $\xrightarrow{(3)}$ extend to all Borel sets.  Then, tho show that the connection with conditional probability is satisfied with monotone class theorem starting from rational balls as the basis for the monotone class. It seems to me that transitions (1),(3) are pretty simple but I am not how to perform transition (2) in such a way that resulting $Q(\omega,\cdot)$ is still a measure. Is my sketch correct? Are where any insufficient steps? How to perform extension (2) correctly? Here is my proof so far:
Lets $R$ be countable dense subset of $M$ . We say that ball $B$ is rational if it has center at $R$ and radius in $\mathbb{Q}$ . lets $Z \subset \Omega $ such that for all $\omega \in Z$ something of the following happens: there are rational balls $A,B$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X \in A|\mathcal{A})(\omega) < \mathbb{P}(X \in B|\mathcal{A})(\omega)$ and in the same time $B \subset A$ . there are $p \in R$ and $r \in Q$ such $\lim_{ n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}\Big( X \in\mathbb{B}(p,r - \gamma/n) \Big|\mathcal{A}\Big) \neq 
\mathbb{P}\Big(X \in \mathbb{B}(p,r)\Big| \mathcal{A} \Big)$ . Here we have ratioanl $
\gamma < r $ there is $p \in R$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}\Big(X \in \mathbb{B}(p,n) \Big| \mathcal{A} \Big) \neq 1$ there is $p \in R$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}\Big(X \in \mathbb{B}(p,1/n) \Big| \mathcal{A} \Big) \neq 0 $ It can be shown that $\mathbb{P}(Z) = 0$ . Assuming that $M$ is nonempty  it is safe  for $\omega \in Z$ to let $
 Q(\omega,\cdot) = \delta_m
$ for some $m \in M$ . For all the other $\omega \in Z^\complement$ ,  for rational ball $B$ define $
Q(\omega,B) = \mathbb{P}\Big( X \in B \Big| \mathcal{A} \Big) .
$ I think we may also define it on the set of finite intersections of rational balls $A = \bigcap^n_{i=1} B_{i}$ in the same way $
Q(\omega,A) = \mathbb{P}\Big(X \in A \Big| \mathcal{A} \Big)
$ . Set of such intersections is still countable, so it might be possible to extend $Z$ so it covers such intersections too. With this we can extend to finite unions with $$
Q\left(\omega, \bigcup^n_{i=1} A_i\right) = \sum^n_{k = 1} (-1)^{n- k} \sum_{I \in 2^n : |I| = k} Q\left(\omega, \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i\right) 
$$ and differences with $$
Q(\omega, A \setminus C) = Q(\omega,A) - Q(\omega,A \cap C)
$$ Now I don't think that step (1) is required untill we have $Q(\omega,\emptyset) = 0$ on $Z^\complement$ { (1) to define $Q$ at $\mathbb{B}(p,r)$ for $(p,r) \in M \times \mathbb{R}_{+}$ select sequences $a \to p$ and $s \uparrow r$ such that $d(a,p) \downarrow 0$ and for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $q_n \le r + d(a_n,p)$ and resulting balls are rational. Then $Q(\omega,\mathbb{B}(a,s))$ converges to some number as bounded and monotonic sequence. Define $Q(\omega,\mathbb{B}(p,r))$ as a limit of this sequence. $Q\Big(\omega,\mathbb{B}(p,r)\Big) = \mathbb{P}\Big(X \in \mathbb{B}(p,r) |\mathcal{A}\Big)(\omega)$ almost surely by dominated convergence theorem for conditional expectation and corresponding indicator functions. At this stage we may define } $$
Q(\omega, \emptyset) = 0 \quad Q(\omega,M) = 1
$$ (2) We may represent open sets as $ U = \bigcup^\infty_{n=1}\bigcap^{N_n}_{m=1} B_{m,n}$ , where $B_{m,n}$ are rational balls with $N_n \in \mathbb{N}$ . This means that me may define $$
Q(\omega,U) = \lim_{n \to \infty} Q\left(\omega, \bigcup^n_{i =1} \bigcap^{N_i}_{j} B_{i,j} \right).
$$ This limit must exist as it is a bounded above non decreasing sequence (requires additional sub-proof).
For countable union of disjoint balls  we get $$
Q\left(\omega, \bigcup^\infty_{n=1} B_n\right) = \sum^\infty_{n=1}Q(\omega,B_n)
$$ by union formula. I think we can extend it arbitrary open sets now. $\ldots$ But how to define it for arbitrary open sets or unions/intersection of not disjoint balls? $\ldots$ (3)
for arbitrary Borel set $B$ selecting $Q(\omega,B) = \inf\{ Q(\omega,U) |   U : \textrm{Open},B \subset U\}$ must hold for any probability measure by outer regularity in Radon space $M$ . In this case we can  say that $Q(\omega,B) = \lim_{n \to \infty} Q(\omega,U_n)$ with $U$ being a decreasing sequence of open sets. $\ldots$","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'metric-spaces', 'solution-verification']"
2414826,Finding partial fractions involving complex numbers: express $h(z) = \frac{2z + 4i}{z^2 + 2z + 2}$ as partial fractions,"I'm attempting the following problem in the context of complex analysis: Express $h(z) = \dfrac{2z + 4i}{z^2 + 2z + 2}$ as partial fractions. I got $\dfrac{2z + 4i}{z^2 + 2z + 2} = \dfrac{2z + 4i}{(z + 1 + i)(z + 1 - i)}$ $= \dfrac{A}{z + 1 + I} + \dfrac{B}{z + 1 - I}$ $\implies 2z + 4i = (A+B)z + (A + B) + i(B - A)$ $\therefore A + B = 2$ AND $B - A = 4$ (AND $A + B = 0$????) $\therefore$ (If we exclude $A + B = 0$) $B = 3$ AND $A = -1$ But we also had that $A + B = 0$ above, which is where my confusion comes from. If I then proceed with what I've done, I get $\dfrac{2z + 4i}{(z + 1 + i)(z + 1 - i)} = \dfrac{-1}{z + 1 + i} + \dfrac{3}{z + 1 - I}$ $= \dfrac{2z + 2 + 4i}{(z + 1 + i)(z + 1 - i)}$, which is obviously false. I've only just started doing partial fraction decomposition with complex numbers, so I'm unfamiliar with the subtleties relative to partial fraction decomposition with real numbers.

2414843,Understanding proof for $e \leq 3v - 6$ in planar graphs,"I have a  proof for a property of a planar graph: Lemma 5.8.4. In a planar embedding of a connected graph, each edge is traversed once by each of two different faces, or is traversed exactly twice by one face. Lemma 5.8.5 . In a planar embedding of a connected graph with at least three vertices, each face is of length at least three. Suppose a connected planar graph has $v \geq 3$ vertices and $e$ edges. Then $e \leq 3v - 6$ Proof. By definition, a connected graph is planar iff it has a planar embedding. So suppose a connected graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges has a planar embedding with $f$ faces. By Lemma 5.8.4, every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries. So the sum of the lengths of the face boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by Lemma 5.8.5, when $v\geq 3$ , each face boundary is of length at least three, so this sum is at least $3f$ . This implies that $3f\leq 2e$ But $f = e - v + 2$ by Euler’s formula, and substituting into the above gives $3(e - v + 2) \leq 2e$ $= e - 3v + 6 \leq 2e$ $= e \leq 3v - 6$ ( Source ) I have been trying to wrap my head around this, but I don't really get it fully. My main issues are: Why do we start with $v\geq 3$ ? Because 3 is the minimum number of vertices needed to forma planar embedding with more than 1 face, or what's the reason? I'm also stuck on this: By Lemma 5.8.4, every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries. So the sum of the lengths of the face boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by Lemma 5.8.5, when $v\geq 3$ , each face boundary is of length at least three, so this sum is at least $3f$ . This implies that $3f\leq 2e$ Why do the two lemmas imply that $3f$ is lower or equal to $2e$ ? I understand each lemma on it's own, but I dont follow that conclusion, to be honest. What is also the significance of this? From what I get, this formula gives an upper-bound on the number of edges in a planar graph, it's then used to proof that a graph is planar nor not, depending on the number of edges, is that right?","['graph-theory', 'proof-explanation', 'planar-graphs', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2415632,"Closed, uncountable set without rationals. [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Perfect set without rationals [closed] (5 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Problem: Find a closed, uncountable without rationals,  subset in the unit interval. Solution: Let X be any binary irrational number , replace the 1s with 2s in the decimal expansion . Now we can use the digits of X as an index for a path through the cantor set, for example, if the first two digits of X are 0 2 then we take [0 , 1/3] and then we take [2/9 , 1/3] . This subset is obviously closed and uncountable, and since we are using an irrational index all the elements of that subset will be irrational. Ok, is there a big mistake here? And secondly, If all the end points of a cantor set are rational doesn't this contradict the above?","['real-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'cantor-set']"

I am not interested specially to get a very good approximation, because Wolfram Alpha provide me one with code int log(1+x^Gamma(x))dx, from x=0 to 1 I would like to know methods about how calculate an approximation of $I$. I suspect that to get a good approximation is required to do analysis about the Gamma function. Question. How calculate using analysis an approximation of $$\int_0^1 \log\left(1+x^{\Gamma(x)}\right)\,dx?$$ Many thanks.","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'gamma-function']"
2415652,true\false questions on number of solutions in combinatorics,"I was preparing for the exam, and then I saw a few questions I did not understand regarding number of solutions in combinatorics. I would be glad if you could take a look and correct me if I'm wrong: (questions are true\false): 1) The number of natural solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=14$ is equal to the number of positive whole number (integer) solutions of: $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=10$ 2) The number of the positive even natural number solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=14$ is equal to the number of the positive odd natural number solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=14$ 3) The number of integer solutions that are either $1$ or $-1$ to $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 \geq 0$ is 10. 4) If $|a|=3^3$ and $|b|=3$, then the number of functions from $a$ to $b$ is equal to the number of functions from $b$ to $a$. What I did: 1)  False.  The number of the natural solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=14$ is $\binom {14+4-1}{3}$ and the number number of positive integer solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=10$ is $\binom {10+4-1}{3}$. It's false because the results are not the same. 2)  False. The number of positive odd natural solutions of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=14$ can be obtained if we divided the result by $2$ ($y_i=x_i/2$), i.e: $y_1+y_2+y_3+y_4=7$, so $\binom {7+4-1}{3}$. and for the even, we need that $x_i \geq 1$, so $y_i=\frac{x_i-1}{2}$, so $\binom {5+4-1}{3}$. 3)  I don't know how to solve it, but I'll try.  If we said the solution is only $1$, then there were no limits, and the result would be: $4!=24$. However, since it's more larger than $0$, we must have more $1$s than $-1$s, so we have to subtract the cases were we have more $-1$ than $1$, i.e: if at least $3$ variables are $-1$, so we subtract $2$ possibilities (either $3$ are $-1$ or $4$ are $-1$), and we get that the number of solutions is $24-2=22$ (If it was $3!-2$, it would make sense. I think I did it wrong). 4) False. If $|a|=3^3=27$ and $|b|=3$, then the number of functions from $a$ to $b$ is not the same as the number of functions from $b$ to $a$.
