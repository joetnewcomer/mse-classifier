\begin{align}
\sum_{n=1} \frac{1}{n!} e^{an}\log(n),

\begin{align}
\sum_{n=1} \frac{1}{n!} e^{an}\log(n) \le   e^{a+e^a}.

2820741,Μax number of bags,"We have $15$ tennis balls and want to place them into plastic bags. What is the largest number of bags we can use, so that each bag has a different number of balls? My initial approach is:
Obviously $1+2+3+4+5=15$ bags, so we use $5$ bags so far. Then we use $1$ bag to put inside bags with $2$ and with $4$ ($=6$ in total) and $1$ bag to put $3+5=8$ in total. Then $1$ more bag to put these $2$ ($=14$ in total) and $1$ more to put this last one along with the initial bag with $1$ ($=15$). All in all $9$ bags.

Let $B(\tau')$ be the Borel $\sigma$-algebra with uniform Bernoulli-measure $\lambda$ on it. I have two questions concerning measure theory/ dynamics: (1) Am I right that $B(\tau')\subseteq B(\tau)$ and $\lambda=\mu_{|B(\tau')}$? (2) For the measure-theoretical entropy, do we have a statement or property telling that we can ""split"" it like
    $$
h_{\mu}(T)=h_{\lambda}(S)+h_{\mu_{|B(\tau')^C}}(T_{|Y^C})?
$$ (1) I think this follows by $\tau'\subseteq \tau$, hence $B(\tau')=\sigma(\tau')\subseteq\sigma(\tau)=B(\tau)$. Moreoever, both $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\tau')$ are separable, hence $B(\tau)=\sigma(C)$ and $B(\tau')=\sigma(C')$, meaning that the Borel $\sigma$-algebras coincide with the product $\sigma$-algebras (= cylinder $\sigma$-algebras). Moreover, $\mu=\lambda$ on $C'$ and $C'$ is invariant under intersection. By uniqueness theorem, $\mu=\lambda$ on $\sigma(C')$. (2) The reason why I am asking this is because I have an example where I can argue that $h_{\lambda}(S)=0$ and for further investigation I would like to know if this implies that $h_{\mu}(T)$ can be determined by neglecting ""what $S$ and $\lambda$ do"".  I have no idea... In case the splitting above is not correct, maybe there is another formula connecting $h_{\mu}(T)$ and $h_{\lambda}(S)$?","['general-topology', 'entropy', 'measure-theory']"

I want to prove and obtain the following properties of $F$: I want to prove that $F$ is a bounded linear functional. I want to find the function $\phi$ s.t. $F(f) = \langle f, \phi \rangle$, and I want to find $||F||$. I instantly hit a wall in this problem. After some googling, I found out that $W_{2}^{1}$ is a kind of Sobolev space; however, this is a problem from functional analysis course, and Sobolev spaces haven't been covered. I think that this problem has a solution which doesn't use any properties of Sobolev spaces. I was able to prove that $F$ is bounded, albeit after some trouble: \begin{equation} 
|F(f)| = |f(0)| = |f(t) - \int_{0}^{t} f'(s)ds| \leq |f(t)| + \int_{0}^{t} |f'(s)|ds \leq |f(t)| + \int_{0}^{1} |f'(s)|ds
 \hspace{0.5cm}(1)\end{equation} Now, since $f$ is continuous, there exists a $t_{0}$ such that $m = |f(t_{0})| = \min_{t \in [0,1]}|f(t)|$. Then $m \leq \int_{0}^{1} |f(t)|dt$. Since $(1)$ holds for all $t \in [0,1]$, by inserting $t=t_{0}$ into $(1)$, we get \begin{equation}
|f(0)| \leq m + \int_{0}^{1}|f'(s)|ds \leq \int_{0}^{1} |f(s)|ds + \int_{0}^{1} |f'(s)|ds \leq \sqrt{\int_{0}^{1} |f'(s)|^2ds} + \sqrt{\int_{0}^{1} |f(s)|^2ds} \leq \sqrt{2}||f||.
\end{equation} For the next-to-last inequality I used Cauchy-Schwartz, and for the last inequality I used $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \leq \sqrt{2}\sqrt{a+b}$, which follows from the AM-GM inequality. Therefore, $||F|| \leq \sqrt{2}$. However, I'm not sure how to find $\phi$ with $F(f) = f(0) = \langle f, \phi \rangle$. If I were to find such a $\phi$, then obviously by the Riesz representation theorem, $||F|| = ||\phi||$. I took a look at Find $y \in W_{2}^{1}[-1,1]$ s.t. $\forall x \in W_{2}^{1}[-1,1]$, $f(x)=\langle x, y \rangle$ , but the operator there is very different from mine, and I can't get a differential equation out of the condition analogous to the one arctic tern obtained there.

2821042,Finding Rational Canonical Form,"So the question I want to answer is the following: Ggive an example of a $10 \times 10$ matrix (over $\mathbb{R}$ ) whose minimal polynomial is $(x^{4}-2)(x+2)^{2}$ and is not similar to any matrix with rational entries. Here is my approach and the questions I have. We have that by the decomposition of modules, we have $$\mathbb{R}[x]/(a_{1}) \bigoplus \cdots \bigoplus \mathbb{R}[x]/(a_{m})$$ where $a_{1}|a_{2}|\dots|a_{m}$ . I read from Dummit and Foote that the minimal polynomial is the largest invariant factor so we get that $a_{m}$ is the minimal polynomial. So my attempt is to consider $$ \frac{\mathbb{R}[x]}{(x-\sqrt[4]{2})}\bigoplus \frac{\mathbb{R}[x]}{(x^{2}-\sqrt{2})(x+2)} \bigoplus \frac{\mathbb{R}[x]}{(x^{4}-2)(x+2)^{2}} $$ The conditions above are satisfied since clearly $a_{1}|a_{2}|a_{3}$ and $a_{3}$ is the minimal polyomial. From what I read in Dummit and Foote, the rational form is the companion matrices of these 3 factors. So my first question is, for the 3rd factor, $\frac{\mathbb{R}[x]}{(x^{4}-2)(x+2)^{2}}$ , my confusion is: Since we are quotienting by a degree 6, would this be a 6 by 6 companion matrix for our polynomial $(x^{4}-2)(x+2)^{2}$ or would it be a 4x4 companion matrix for $(x^{4}-2)$ followed by another 2x2 block which is the companion matrix of $(x+2)^{2}$ . Or since we have that our matrix is over $\mathbb{R}$ , our minimal polynomial factors as $$(x^{4}-2)(x+2)^{2}=(x-\sqrt[4]{2})(x+\sqrt[4]{2})(x^{2}+2)(x+2)^{2}$$ so we actually have $1\times1$ , $1\times1$ , $2\times2$ , and $2\times2$ companion matrices. As for my second question, unless there is a faster way, if there was a rational matrix,B, that was similar to my rational form, call it A, then $$A=PBP^{-1}$$ But then $$\det(A) = \det(B)$$ so I just need to show that my matrix (I haven't computed this long determinant for $10 \times 10$ since I am not sure what my matrix is as from my 1st question), has determinant that is not in $\mathbb{Q}$ right? Since the determinant of $B$ is in $\mathbb{Q}$ , my hope is by including those 4th roots of $2$ , I get $\det(A) \not \in \mathbb{Q}$ .","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'minimal-polynomials']"

2821112,"""Integral milking"": working backward to construct nontrivial integrals","I begin this post with a plea: please don't be too harsh with this post for being off topic or vague. It's a question about something I find myself doing as a mathematician, and wonder whether others do it as well. It is a soft question about recreational mathematics - in reality, I'm shooting for more of a conversation. I know that a lot of users on this site (e.g. Cleo, Jack D'Aurizio, and so on) are really good at figuring out crafty ways of solving recreational definite integrals, like
$$\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \frac{x\sin(x)}{5-4\cos(x)} \, dx$$
or
$$\int_0^\infty \bigg(\frac{x-1}{\ln^2(x)}-\frac{1}{\ln(x)}\bigg)\frac{dx}{x^2+1}$$
When questions like this pop up on MSE, the OP provides an integral to evaluate, and the answerers can evaluate it using awesome tricks including (but certainly not limited to): Clever substitution Exploitation of symmetry in the integrand Integration by parts Expanding the integrand as a series Differentiating a well-know integral-defined function, like the Gamma or Beta functions Taking Laplace and Inverse Laplace transforms But when I play around with integrals on my own, I don't always have a particular problem to work on. Instead, I start with a known integral, like
$$\int_0^\pi \cos(mx)\cos(nx) \, dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{mn},\space\space \forall m,n\in
\mathbb Z^+$$
and ""milk"" it, for lack of a better word, to see how many other obscure, rare, or aesthetically pleasing integrals I can derive from it using some of the above techniques. For example, using the above integral, one might divide both sides by $m$, getting
$$\int_0^\pi \frac{\cos(mx)}{m}\cos(nx) \, dx=\frac{\pi}{2m}\delta_{mn},\space\space \forall m,n,k\in
\mathbb Z^+$$
Then, summing both sides from $m=1$ to $\infty$, and exploiting a well-known Fourier Series, obtain
$$\int_0^\pi \cos(nx)\ln(2-2\cos(x)) \, dx=-\frac{\pi}{n},\space\space \forall n\in
\mathbb Z^+$$
or, after a bit of algebra, the aesthetically pleasing result
$$\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(2nx)\ln(\sin(x)) \, dx=-\frac{\pi}{4n},\space\space \forall n\in
\mathbb Z^+$$
After pulling a trick like this, I look through all of my notebooks and integral tables for other known integrals on which I can get away with the same trick, just to see what integrals I can ""milk"" out of them in the same way. This is just an example - even using the same starting integral, countless others can be obtained by using other Fourier Series, Power Series, integral identities, etc. For example, some integrals derived from the very same starting integral include
$$\int_0^\pi \frac{\cos(nx)}{q-\cos(x)} \, dx=\frac{\pi(q-\sqrt{q^2-1})^{n+1}}{1-q^2+q\sqrt{q^2-1}}$$
$$\int_0^\pi \frac{dx}{(1+a^2-2a\cos(x))(1+b^2-2b\cos(mx))}=\frac{\pi(1+a^m b)}{(1-a^2)(1-b^2)(1-a^m b)}$$
and the astounding identity
$$\int_0^{\pi/2}\ln{\lvert\sin(mx)\rvert}\cdot \ln{\lvert\sin(nx)\rvert}\, dx=\frac{\pi^3}{24}\frac{\gcd^2(m,n)}{mn}+\frac{\pi\ln^2(2)}{2}$$
Everyone seems to be curious about the proof of this last identity. A proof can be found in my answer here . I just pick a starting integral, and using every technique I know as many times as possible, try to come up with the most exotic integrals as I can, rather than picking a specific integral and trying to solve it. Of course, integrals generated this way would be poor (or at least extremely difficult) candidates for contest problems or puzzles to evaluate given the integral, since they are derived ""backwards,"" and determining the derivation given the integral is likely much harder than pursuing the vague goal of a ""nice-looking integral"" with no objective objective (ha ha). QUESTION: Do you (residents of MSE who regularly answer/pose recreational definite integral questions) do this same activity, in which you try to generate , rather than solve, cool integrals? If so, what are some  integrals you have come up with in this way? What strategies do you use? Does anyone care to opine on the value (or perhaps lack of value) of seeking integrals in this way?

2821290,Area of Shaded Region Inside Quadrilateral,"I recently saw a similar problem online but found the area in a completely different way. Problem: There is a unit square, i.e. a square with side length equal to $\text 1$ . Two lines are placed inside the square. Lets call them $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ and $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ . $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ is straight - It starts at a vertex and intersects the square exactly half way on the opposite edge. $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ is curved - It is a quarter circle with radius, $r$ , the same length as the square, i.e. $r=1$ . The diagram below shows the representation of the description provided above (I am not a geometric mathematician so forgive my elementary descriptions - please): The goal is to find the area $A$ . My Attempt: My intuition was to straight away subtract areas. So find the area of the quarter circle and subtract off the area under the intersection of $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ and $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ . So in the following diagram I find area $A+B+C$ and subtract area $B$ and area $C$ : Now clearly the area $A+B+C$ is simply the area of a quarter circle. This is: $$Area(A+B+C)=\frac {\pi r^2}4=\frac \pi4$$ Next, I find the point of intersection in the Cartesian plane of the $\text 2$ lines (where the red and blue lines intersect). I assume the bottom left point on the square represents the coordinates $(0,0)$ . Therefore the $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ has equation: $$y=-2x+1$$ And $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ lines has equation: $$y=\sqrt{1-(x-1)^2}$$ The intersection is at: $$-2x+1=\sqrt{1-(x-1)^2} \implies (-2x+1)^2=1-(x-1)^2$$ $$\implies 4x^2-4x+1=-x^2+2x$$ $$\implies 5x^2-6x+1=0 \implies (5x-1)(x-1)=0 \implies x=-\frac 15$$ Then we have $y=-2x+1=-2\frac 15 +1 = \frac 35$ so the coordinates of intersection (inside the square) are $\left(\frac 15, \frac 35 \right)$ . Then the area $B$ is simply the area of a triangle, with height $h$ and base $b$ : $$h=\frac 35 \ , \ b=\frac 12 - \frac 15= \frac 3{10}$$ $$\therefore Area(B)=\frac 12 bh= \frac 12 \frac 3{10} \frac 35= \frac 9{100}$$ Now for area $C$ , this is simply the area under the curve of a (semi-) circle between the $x$ -coordinates $x=0$ and $x=\frac 15$ . Clearly this is not the neatest integral, so we just shift the circle coordinates and the area becomes: $$Area(C)=\int_0^{1/5} \sqrt{1-(x-1)^2}dx$$ $$=\int_{-1}^{-4/5} \sqrt{1-x^2}dx=\left[ \frac 12 \left(x\sqrt{1-x^2}+\sin^{-1}(x) \right) \right]_{-1}^{-4/5}$$ $$=-\frac 6{25}+\frac \pi 4 - \frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)$$ Putting it all together we get: $$Area(A)=Area(A+B+C)-Area(B)-Area(C)$$ $$=\frac \pi4- \frac 9{100} - \left[-\frac 6{25}+\frac \pi 4 - \frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)\right]$$ $$=\frac 3{20}+\frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)$$ $$\approx 0.61365$$ My Question: Is this the best approach?

Definition: A multiplicative linear functional on $ A $ is a non-zero linear functional $ \phi $ on $ A $ such that $$ \phi(xy) = \phi(x) \phi(y) $$ for all $ x, y \in A $. Proposition 3: Let $ \phi $ be a multiplicative linear functional on $ A $.  Then $ \phi $ is continuous and $ \| \phi \| \leq 1 $. The proof in the text is as follows: Proof: Suppose that there exists $ x \in A $ with $ \| x \| < 1 $ and $ \phi (x) = 1 $, and let $ y = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^n $.  Then $ x + xy = y $, and so $$ 1 + \phi(y) = \phi(x) + \phi(x)\phi(y) = \phi(x + xy) = \phi(y) $$ which is absurd. $ \blacksquare $ I understand every step of the above proof - the only problem is that I don't see how this proves that $ \phi $ is bounded.

2821362,Confusion about definition of continuous spectrum,"In discussions about the spectrum of hyperbolic surfaces, people seem to be interested in 'eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum'. I am wondering which definition of the term 'continuous spectrum' is usually meant in this context? The reason I am asking this is because people seem to use different definitions for the term 'continuous spectrum'. Let me list three definitions I know about. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space and $T:\mathcal{H}\supset \mathcal{D}(T)\rightarrow\mathcal{H}$ be a densely defined, self-adjoint, and closed operator. Then people refer to the following sets as continuous spectrum: \begin{align}
\sigma_c(T):&=\lbrace{\lambda\in\mathbb{K}: Im(T-\lambda)\neq \overline{Im(T-\lambda)}\rbrace}\\
\sigma_c(T)':&=\lbrace{\lambda\in\mathbb{K}: ker(T-\lambda)=\lbrace{0\rbrace},\,\, Im(T-\lambda)\neq \mathcal{H},\,\,\overline{Im(T-\lambda)}=\mathcal{H}\rbrace}\\
\sigma_c(T)'':&=\sigma_{ess}(T)-\sigma_{p}(T),
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{ess}(T)$ is the essential spectrum and $\sigma_{p}(T)$ the point spectrum (=set of all eigenvalues). Moreover, there is also the notion of continuous spectrum coming from the spectral measure associated to $T$. I must admit that I do not understand that definition completely, because I do not know used to work with the spectral measure. I think it corresponds to the union of the 'absolutely continuous spectrum' and the 'singular spectrum', as defined on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_spectrum_(functional_analysis) I have two questions, which causes me confusion: 1)Which of the above definitions are meant in the context stated at the beginning above? 2) How is the last notion of 'continuous spectrum' related to the other definitions?

So I am asking what is wrong with this construction, it is supposed to yield a topology whose convergence is a.e. convergence. Let $\Omega$ be a measure space, and let $X=L^p(\Omega)$ for some $p\in [1,\infty)$. Definition. A subset $S\subset X$ is called closed if for all $\left\{f_n\right\}\subset X$ with $f_n\to f$ a.e., we have $f\in S$. Now let $\tau$ be the collection of all closed sets. We need to prove that it satisfies the topology axioms (for closed sets). It is clear that $ \emptyset, X\in \tau$. Let $ \left\{S_j\right\}_{j\in J}\subset \tau$. Then if $\left\{f_n\right\}\subset S:=\bigcap_{j\in J}S_j$, and $ f_n\to f$, since $ \left\{f_n\right\}\subset S_j$ for all $ j\in J$, we have $ f\in S_j$ for all $j$, and thus $ f\in S$. Therefore, $ S$ is closed. Let $ S_1,S_2\in \tau$. Then if $ \left\{f_n\right\}\subset S_1\cup S_2$ with $ f_n\to f$, there is a subsequence of $ \left\{f_n\right\}$ that is entirely contained on either $ S_1$ or $ S_2$. Such subsequence converges again to $ f$, so $ f\in S_1\cup S_2$, and $ S_1\cup S_2$ is closed. Thus the complementary of $\tau$ is a topology on $X$, and I expect that in this topology we should have $f_n\to f$ iff $f_n\to f$ a.e: If $f_n\to f$ a.e., then let $U$ be an open (i.e., $U^c$ is closed) neighborhood of $f$. By contradiction if $f_n\not\to f$, there would be a subsequence $\left\{f_{n_k}\right\}$ which stays aways from $U$, yet $f_{n_k}\to f\in U$ a.e., which contradicts the fact that $U^C$ is closed. If $f_n\to f$, then I am struggling to prove that $f_n\to f$ a.e. Is this is it, then? It is not true that the convergence in the topology just defined implies a.e. convergence? (Attempt: Suppose $f_n\to f$. If $f_n\not \to f$ a.e., then there is a subsequence $F:=\left\{f_{n_k}\right\}$ such that $f\notin \bar{F}$. I would like to say that there is a neighborhood $U$  of $f$ such that $U\cap \bar{F}= 0$, a contradiction with $f_n\to f$; but this is not possible unless I prove some separability properties of $(X,\tau)$. )","['general-topology', 'fake-proofs', 'convergence-divergence']"

2822007,Submodule Criterion for Rings without 1,"In section 10.1 (page 342) of Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra , they state the following: Proposition 1. (The Submodule Criterion) Let $R$ be a ring and let $M$ be an $R$-module. A subset $N$ of $M$ is a submodule of $M$ if
  and only if (1) $N \neq \emptyset$, and (2) $x + ry \in N$ for all $r \in R$ and for all $x, y \in N$. This proposition states that $R$ is simply a ring, not that it has identity. In the next definition, they specifically state ""a commutative ring with identity."" In the definition of a module at the beginning of the section, they emphasize that $R$ is ""not necessarily commutative nor with 1."" However, the proof proceeds as follows: Proof: If $N$ is a submodule, then $0 \in N$ so $N \neq \emptyset$. Also $N$ is closed under addition and is sent to itself under the action of
  elements of $R$. Conversely, suppose (1) and (2) hold. Let $r = -1$
  and apply the subgroup criterion (in additive form) to see that $N$ is
  a subgroup of $M$. In particular, $0 \in N$. Now let $x = 0$ and apply
  hypothesis (2) to see that $N$ is sent to itself under the action of
  $R$. This establishes the proposition. Clearly, by letting $r = -1$, this proof assumes that $R$ has identity. Now, consider $R = 4\mathbb{Z}$, which is a ring without identity. Then, $4 \mathbb{Z}$ acts on the set $M = \mathbb{Z}$ by $r \cdot m = rm$, that is, by normal multiplication. Clearly, distributivity and associativity are inherited, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is a left $4\mathbb{Z}$-module. Take $N = 4\mathbb{Z} \cup (3 + 4\mathbb{Z})$, that is, the subset of integers congruent to $3$ or $0$ modulo $4$. Certainly, $N \neq \emptyset$. If $x, y \in N$, then $x + ry \equiv x \pmod{4}$, for any $r \in R$, so that $x + ry \in N$. Therefore, by Proposition 1, $N$ should be a $4\mathbb{Z}$-submodule of $\mathbb{Z}$. But $N$ is not an abelian group because $3 \in N$ but $-3 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ is not in $N$. I have checked the errata, but I did not see this listed. I have also checked other textbooks, but it can be difficult to determine when they are assuming identity or not, since there is often a sentence somewhere earlier in the book that says all rings are assumed unital. I have also found the following alternative definition: Definition . Let $N$ be a subset of the $R$-module $M$. Then $N$ is a submodule of $M$ if and only if the following hold: (1) $N \neq \emptyset$, and (2) $rx + sy \in N$ for all $r, s \in R$ and $x, y \in N$. However, with this definition, similar counterexamples can still be found. Questions : Am I correct in my assessment that this is an error? Is there a ""Submodule Criterion"" that works for rings $R$ without identity?","['abstract-algebra', 'modules']"

In the comments to this answer a user asked for an $S$ such that $\sum f_n'$ is pointwise convergent but not identical to $S'$. Out of curiosity I gave it a try.
For such an $S$, I thought it's convenient to start from $T=\sum f_n'$, assuming the $f_n'$ are integrable and $T$ does not converge uniformly, in order to integrate the $f_n'$ on a convenient interval and take the sum of these resulting functions as $S$. Soon enough I came up with $$T(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty-x(1-x)^n=\begin{cases}x-1 &x\in(0,1] \\ 0&x=0.\end{cases} $$which suggests$$S(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(1-x)^{n+1}(nx+x+1)}{(n+1)(n+2)}.$$ On $[0,1]$ one has $S(x)=\frac12(x-1)^2$ and thus $S'(x)=x-1$.

I already know that for any irreducible elements $x,y\in X$, if they have infimum $x\sqcap y$, then they commute. Indeed, we have $e\leq x\sqcap y\leq x$, so $x\sqcap y=e$ or $x\sqcap y=x$. If $x\sqcap y=x$, then $e<x\leq y$, so $x=y$, so they commute. If $x\sqcap y=e$, then for every $z\in X$ we have $(xy\leq z\Leftrightarrow e\leq x^{-1}zy^{-1}\Leftrightarrow yz^{-1}x\leq e\Leftrightarrow (yz^{-1}x\leq x\text{ and }yz^{-1}x\leq y)\Leftrightarrow (yz^{-1}\leq e\text{ and }z^{-1}x\leq e)\Leftrightarrow (y\leq z\text{ and }x\leq z))$ and analogously we have $(yx\leq z\Leftrightarrow(x\leq z\text{ and }y\leq z))$ so both $xy$ and $yx$ are suprema of $x$ and $y$, so they are equal. However, I have no idea about what to do if they do not have infimum.","['lattice-orders', 'ordered-groups', 'group-theory', 'order-theory']"
2822224,Is there any function that is differentiable at z_0 but not analytic at the same point?,"Recently, I am learning complex analysis using "" Complex Analysis for mathematics and engineering"" by John H. Mathews and Russell W. Howell. The definition of analytic function at a point $z_0$ is defined as follows: If a function $f(z)$ is differentiable at $z_0$ and its neighborhood , then we say that $f$ is analytic at $z_0$. But nearly every nice function e.g. $\sin z$, $\text{exp}(z)$ is analytic and the professor doesn't even check that in the neighborhood of $z_0$, $f$ is analytic.

The first summand is invariant by the definition of $D_u$. What about the other two summands? Is this reasoning correct?

The answer is: $e^{\frac 45}$ I gave a thought to it and this is what I did: If $\alpha \to \infty$ and $\alpha$ is a root of $P(x)$, then for $x \to \infty$, $P(x) \to 0$. Also, as $x \to \infty$, the denominator $5(x-1) \to \infty$. Therefore, $\dfrac {P(x)}{5(x-1)} \to 0$. And hence the whole limit asked in the question tends to zero. There is a flaw in my reasoning.

2822331,Asymptotic Stability Criterion,"I'm currently reading Saber Elaydi's Introduction to Difference Equations. I am confused with the proof of theorem 1.15 which states the following: Let $x^*$ be an equilibrium point of $x(n+1)=f(x(n))$ where $f$ is continuously differentiable at $x^*$ . Then it follows that: If $f''(x^*)\neq 0$ , then $x^*$ is unstable. If $f''(x^*)=0$ and $f'''(x^*)>0$ , then $x^*$ is unstable. If $f''(x^*)=0$ and $f'''(x^*)<0$ , then $x^*$ is asymptotically stable. The proof of the first item is given in the book (pp. 30), while the other two are not. Those are left as exercises. The proof of the first item starts off by stating that $f$ must be either concave upward or downward depending on the sign of $f''(x^*)$ . Then we assume $f''(x^*)> 0$ , since this is the case, it follows that $f'$ is increasing on a neighborhood of $x^*$ . My first question comes from this part. The author states: If $f''(x^*)>0$ , then $f'(x)>1$ for all $x$ in a small interval $\rbrack x^*,x^*+\varepsilon\lbrack$ . Then it would follow by another stability criterion that $f$ is unstable at $x$ . Does that hold for the whole neighborhood of $x$ ? Including $x^*$ , even if it is in the boundary of the neighborhood? I don't know how to justifiy this. How does $f''(x^*)>0$ , imply $f'(x)>1$ ? My first attempt to answer this question was to say:
Since $f'$ grows near $x^*$ then in some neighborhood it must grow around 1. I know it sounds wrong, but it didn't when I thought of it the first time. The problem with my idea is that $f'$ can be bounded and I don't know if $\varepsilon $ can be made as large as I want. This also threw me off when reading the next part. (...) if $f''(x^*)<0$ , then $f'(x)>1$ for $x\in\rbrack x^*-\varepsilon,x^*\lbrack$ . Once again by a previous criterion, $x^*$ is unstable. How does $f'(x)>1$ follow from $f''(x^*)<0$ ? If the same conclusion followed from $f''(x^*)>0$ , in which way is that hypothesis being used? That $f''(x^*)<0$ implies that $f'$ is decreasing in a neighborhood of $x^*$ . I know that from the left, the values of $f'$ must be bigger than $f'(x^*)$ . But what if $f'$ is bounded, or always negative? I can't wrap my head around this. These are all my questions for the first part of the proof. I tried gathering some ideas for the second statement. If $f'''(x^*)>0$ then by the same argument as before $f''(x)>1$ in a neighborhood of $x^*$ , in particular $f''(x)>0$ Then I think that the argument should run as before. For the third statement, I am trying to get to the condition $|f'(x^*)|<1$ to inmediately use the stability criterion and show that $x^*$ is asymptotically stable. However I can also try to get to the definition of being asymptotically stable, but the function with its third derivative at this point seems too convoluted to actuall try to use the definition. Any lead for the second and third part is greatly appreciated.","['derivatives', 'recurrence-relations', 'stability-theory', 'proof-explanation']"

2822342,What does it mean to differentiate entropy and information contents?,"I'm taking an information theory class and encountered some concepts regarding differentiation that I wasn't sure how to understand. In class, my instructor gave many examples and solutions done by ""finding the derivative"" for certain probability distribution functions, or finding the derivatives for other concepts like information entropy or mutual information. But in general, what does it exactly mean to differentiate a probability, and what is the motivation for doing so? $\space$ Edit Here's a specific example to what I'm referring to. It's an exercise problem from the textbook Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms - David Mackay . $\space$ Exercise Problem Consider the $Z$ channel with $f = 0.15$ . Identifying the optimal input distribution is not so straightforward. We evaluate $I(X;Y)$ explicitly for $P_X = \{p_0, p_1\}$ . First, we need to compute $P(y)$ . The probability of $y = 1$ is easiest to write down: $$P(y = 1) = p_1(1 - f)$$ Then the mutual information is: $$I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$ $$ = H_2(p_1(1 - f)) - (p_0H_2(0) + p_1H_2(f))$$ $$ = H_2(p_1(1 - f)) - p_1H_2(f))$$ This is a non-trivial function of $p_1$ . It is maximized for $f = 0.15$ by $p_1^* = 0.445$ . We find capacity $C(Q_Z) = 0.685$ . Now, in the case of general $f$ , show that the optimal input distribution is $$p_1^* = \frac{1/(1-f)}{1 + 2^{(H_2(f)/(1 - f))}}$$ $\space$ Solution In the exercise, we showed that the mutual information between input and output of the $Z$ channel is $$I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$ $$ = H_2(p_1(1 - f)) - p_1H_2(f)$$ We differentiate this expression with respect to $p_1$ , taking care not to confuse $\log_2$ with $\log_e$ : $$\frac{d}{dp_1}I(X;Y) = (1 - f)\log_2\frac{1 - p_1(1 - f)}{p_1(1 - f)} - H_2(f)$$ Setting this derivative to zero and rearranging it, we obtain: $$p_1^*(1 - f) = \frac{1}{1 + 2^{H_2(f)/(1 - f)}}$$ so the optimal input distribution is $$p_1^* = \frac{1/(1-f)}{1 + 2^{(H_2(f)/(1 - f))}}$$ $\space$ So that's the particular question and solution that motivated me to ask this question. I just wasn't sure how the solution came to the idea of differentiating the mutual information, and if there was a more ""general"" motivation for differentiating probability functions what they might be.

2822373,Combinatorics) Painting a cube - how to prove constructive counting method?,"In the classic counting problem where you have to give the number of possible ways to paint a cube with 6 different colors, A well-known approach is constructive counting: fixing the first color to one of the faces, assuming the cube is fixed in some position relative to that colored face, and then going about painting the rest of the faces with the remaining 5 colors. This goes : $1 \cdot 5 \cdot 3! = 6/6 \cdot 5 \cdot 3!$ Obviously, ""fixing"" is equivalent to assuming that the 6 different starting options we have in the beginning for the first color are all going to end up with the same set of 6-color arrangement, with the cardinality (the number of elements in the set) being $30$. More specifically, if we assume each element of the set is a permutation or an arrangement of the 6 colors on the cube, each of the 6 starting options enumerate the same set. Since in this case, the problem space is quite small and visualization of why ""fixing"" doesn't cause problem is obvious.

Friedman, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 84, No. 405 (Mar., 1989), pp. 165-175 (original source ): It is well known that the estimates based on Equation (12) produce biased estimates of the eigenvalues; the largest ones are biased high and the smallest ones are biased toward values that are too low. This bias is most pronounced when the population eigenvalues tend toward equality, and it is correspondingly less severe when their values are highly disparate. In all cases, this phenomenon becomes more pronounced as the sample size decreases.

so the answer we get is $\dfrac{1}{-i}$. But my book is saying that I should get $i$.","['algebra-precalculus', 'complex-numbers']"
2822547,Derivative of Shannon entropy for discrete distrubtions,"I'm trying to find the derivate of the Shannon entropy for discrete distributions, i.e. the derivative of: $H(P)=-\sum_{i=0}^n p_i * log(p_i)$ I didn't have much trouble finding the solution for the binary case, using 
$p_1 = 1-p_0$ such that:
$H(p_0) = -p_0 * log(p_0) - (1-p_0) * log(1 - p_0)$ $H'(p_0) = log(1-p_0) - log(p_0))$ However, I'm not sure how to deal with the constraint that $\sum_{i=0}^n p_i=1 $ in the general case. Obviously, computing a partial derivative under the assumption that $p_i$ and $p_j$ are independent if $i\ne j$ leads to a meaningless result. I'd appreciate any tips on how this should be approached. Edit:
Derivative under the assumption that all probabilities are independent from each other:
$H(p_i)=-(log(p_i)-1)/ln(2)$","['entropy', 'analysis']"

The ""A""series of paper sizes. Going into 3-D Euclidean space, I've found an object with the same property: a cuboid with side lengths in the ratio $1: 2^{\frac{1}{3}} : 2^{\frac{2}{3}}$. When bisected with a planar cut as shown in the figure, the two identical cuboids created are similar to the original (one set of similar faces are shown in blue). Having googled, I've so far found no mention of this elegantly simple cuboid that features the Delian constant , i.e. $2^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Does anyone know of references to this object (book, web-based, etc.)?","['reference-request', 'solid-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'recreational-mathematics']"

2822577,The continuous image of a First Countable Space need not be First Countable (Willard 16.B.1),"In Stephen Willard's General Topology appears the following exercise: A quotient of a second countable space need not be second countable (for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, let $I_n$ be a copy of $[0,1]$ and let $X$ be the disjoint union of the spaces $I_n$. Now identify the left-hand endpoints of all intervals $I_n$. The resulting space $Z$ is not first countable at the distinguished point, and hence not second countable, although $X$ is second countable.

2822580,Is it possible to divide a isosceles triangle,"We have an isosceles triangle and we divide it by two sections going out of one of three corners, hence we get three new triangles. Is it possible to make (puzzle) an isosceles triangle out of every two of three triangles that we got after dividing the first one?
