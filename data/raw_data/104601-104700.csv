1472678,Proving the limit of a sequence using definitions,"This is a review that my professor posted and I want to make sure I'm on the right path as I study $\cdot \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} n - \sqrt{2n^2+1} = n -\sqrt{2n^2+1}*\frac{n+\sqrt{2n^2+1}}{n+\sqrt{2n^2+1}} = \frac{-n^2-1}{n+\sqrt{2n^2+1}}$ So can I say that $M<\frac{-n^2-1}{n+\sqrt{2n^2+1}} \le \frac{n^2}{2n}\le \frac{n}{2}   $ and let my function be $N(M) = \frac{2}{M}$ when $n>N$ $\cdot \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{10^n}{n!} $ so can I say for a large n, maybe $n>20$  $\frac{10^n}{n!}\le \frac{1}{n!}$ therefore the function $N(\epsilon) = \max${$20, \epsilon!$} I feel like I'm very off track with this one This is the reverse of 2, but wouldn't it be the same approach but to find $N(M) $ such that $M>n!$ Finally,
$\cdot \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{3n-2000} = \frac{\frac{n}{n}}{\frac{3n}{n}-\frac{2000}{n}} = \frac{1}{3-\frac{2000}{n}}$ so then find $N(M)$ such that $M> \frac{1}{3} - \frac{n}{2000}$ therefore $N(M) = 2000(M-\frac{1}{3})$ or would $N(M) = Max${$\frac{2000}{3}, 2000M$}","['sequences-and-series', 'self-learning', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"

1472698,Are all paths with the same endpoints homotopic in a simply connected region?,"It is clear to me that if all paths (with the same endpoints) in a region are homotopic then that region is simply connected, however I am having difficultly proving the converse, that is, all paths with the same endpoints are homotopic in a simply connected region. Here is what I have so far Given two paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which begin and end at the same point, we can define a loop at either of those points by
\begin{align}
\gamma(t) = 
\begin{cases}
\alpha(2t) &\quad 0 \leq t \leq 1/2\\
\beta(1-2t) &\quad 1/2 \leq t \leq 1\\
\end{cases}
\end{align} By assumption, the space is simply connected, and so all loops can be deformed into all other loops. The loop $\gamma$ can then be deformed to \begin{align}
\gamma'(t) = 
\begin{cases}
\alpha(2t) &\quad 0 \leq t \leq 1/2\\
\alpha(1-2t) &\quad 1/2 \leq t \leq 1\\

1472711,Proper Subsets and One-to-One,"I want to make sure I am understanding this correctly. If we have a function $f$ which maps $A$ to $B$, and $A$ is a subset or proper subset of $B$ then $f$ is one to one from $A$ to $B$? Is that true? Or does that only hold in the case of $f(x)=x$? My textbook is trying to show that the $|(0,1)| = |(0,1]|$.
I sort of understand the first part: 1) Because $(0,1) ⊂ (0,1]$, $f(x)=x$ is a one to one function from $(0,1)$ to $(0,1]$. Then it says: 2) The function $g(x)=x/2$ is clearly one-to-one and maps $(0,1] $to $(0, 1/2] ⊂ (0,1)$. By Schroder-Bernstein theorem, $|(0,1)| = |(0,1]|$ Yet I don't get how the second part is sufficient as the function $g$ maps $(0,1]$ to a subset of $(0,1)$ but forgets about $[1/2, 1)$.

The same to prove that a linear function $F:\mathbb{E}^*(\mathbb{R}^n)\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^*(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is continuous. We know that convergence on the topological dual of a space X is pointwise convergence.But why continuity is equivalent with sequential continuity?

1472783,Proving an eigenspace is a T-Invariant subspace.,"I want to know if I'm going about this proof the correct way. Problem Statement: Let $T$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$, and let $λ$ be a scalar. The eigenspace $V^{(λ)}$ is the set of eigenvectors of $T$ with eigenvalue $λ$, together with $\textbf{0}$. Prove that $V^{(λ)}$ is a $T$-invariant subspace. So I need to show that $T(V^{(λ)})\subseteq V^{(λ)}$. Since $V^{(λ)}$ is the set of eigenvectors of the matrix $T$ corresponding to $λ$, that meants that for any $\textbf{v}\in V^{(λ)}$, we have $T\textbf{v}=λ\textbf{v}$. Clearly, $T\textbf{v}\in T(V^{(λ)})$.
Then we know that for any $\textbf{v}\in V^{(λ)}$, $\text{span}(\textbf{v})\in V^{(λ)}$. Thus, $λ\textbf{v}\in V^{(λ)}$. Since $T\textbf{v}=λ\textbf{v}$, then $T\textbf{v}\in V^{(λ)}$.

1472981,How and why does Grothendieck's work provide tools to attack problems in number theory?,"This is probably a horrible question to experts, but I think it is reasonable from someone who knows nothing. I have always been fascinated with Grothendieck and the way he did mathematics. I've heard Mochizuki's work on the abc conjecture heavily involves Grothendick-ean algebro-geometric ideas (it kind of seems like everything does). I also know Grothendieck's work has been crucial in the development of tools and subsequent proof of the Weil conjectures. Moreover, I've generally seen Grothendieck's name pop up in all kinds of number-theoretic contexts. From what I've read about Grothendieck himself, it seems fair to say he wasn't very interested in numbers at all, at least not in the sense of solving specific problems like the abc conjecture. It also seems safe to say that Grothendieck's mathematics was not generally developed for the purpose of solving specific problems. And yet, his highly abstract ideas find use in one of the seemingly least ""functorial"" branches of math. Why is this? Knowing very little mathematics myself, I tried to read about Grothendieck's part in the proof of the Weil conjectures. The term "" algebraic geometry over the integers "" (page 15, third paragraph) caught my eye, and I have (falsely?) concluded that in a very rough sense, the generality in which Grothendieck worked gave algebraic geometry the flexibility needed to ""work"" over the integers. I have not been able to find anything as accessible about Mochizuki's work, and I can understand absolutely nothing from the discussions on MO. I also don't know any number theory, I'm just curious how such abstract mathematics can produce (even merely interact with) such incredibly concrete, specific results. So I guess my questions are: How do Grothendieck's ideas manifest in number theory? Why is this possible? Is it ""just"" about brilliantly applying algebro-geometric ideas to the integers? Exactly which ideas of Grothendieck's ideas appear in these number-theoretic contexts? Am I missing the point entirely and asking the wrong questions because I don't know anything concrete?","['big-picture', 'algebraic-geometry', 'number-theory']"
1472984,Linear algebra machinery for differentiation of families of functions.,"So I know that since differentiation is linear, for many types of functions we can represent it using linear algebra. Famous examples include polynomials, if we represent them with their coefficients stored in vectors. Such a matrix performing differentiation on 4th order polynomial could look like: $$D(4) = \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0&1&0&0&0\\
0&0&2&0&0\\
0&0&0&3&0\\
0&0&0&0&4
\end{array}\right] \text{assuming order of coefficients stored as  }  \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
x^0\\
x^1\\
x^2\\
x^3\\
x^4
\end{array}\right]$$ Other families of functions have other differential operators, the trigonometric functions are well known for this: $$D_{sintrig} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0&1\\
-1&0
\end{array}\right] \text{assuming coefficients stored like} \left[\begin{array}{rr}
\sin\\
\cos
\end{array}\right]$$
and the hyperbolic trigs:
$$D_{hyptrig} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
0&1\\
1&0
\end{array}\right] \text{assuming coefficients stored like} \left[\begin{array}{rr}
\sinh\\
\cosh
\end{array}\right]$$
Then we can go one step further, investigating what happens when we use chain rule. A famous example for this is the Hermite polynomials which are the polynomials resulting in iteratively differentiating the function $e^{-x^2}$ which is of the form $\exp(P(x))$. This also gives linear representations, although more complicated.

1473090,Negation of the Definition of Limit of a Function,"Question Suppose we are dealing with real valued functions $f(x)$ of one real variable $x$.

In fact, what is the negation of the above statement? I am interested to obtain the negation with a step by step approach using tautologies in logic .

My Thought I just wrote down the two following negations without going through a step by step approach. $$\forall L,\exists \varepsilon  > 0:\left( {\forall \delta  > 0,\exists x:0 < \left| {x - a} \right| < \delta  \implies \left| {f(x) - L} \right| \ge \varepsilon } \right)$$ or $$\nexists L:\left( {\forall \varepsilon  > 0,\exists \delta  > 0:\left( {\forall x,0 < \left| {x - a} \right| < \delta  \implies \left| {f(x) - L} \right| < \varepsilon } \right)} \right)$$ I want to know weather these are true or not. Example I will give an example of what I mean by a step by step approach.

1473111,Does Closed Graph Theorem imply Uniform Boundedness Principle for functionals?,"For Functionals, Uniform Boundedness Principle can be rephrased as the following : Let ${X}$ be a Banach Space, $K$ be the field($\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$). Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the subset of $BL(X,K)$ such that for each $x \in X$, the set $\{F(x): F \in \mathcal{F}\}$ is bounded in $K$. Then $\{||F||:F \in \mathcal{F}\}$ is bounded i.e uniformly bounded on the unitball of $X$. The closed graph theorem states that: Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach Spaces.

But this is not a linear map. So it doesn't work.

1473169,What is the right way to define a function?,"Most authors define functions this way: Given the sets $A$ and $B$ . A relation is a subset of $A\times B$ . Then given a relation $R$ , we define $Dom_R=\{x|(x,y)\in R\}$ and $Img_R=\{x|(y,x)\in R\}$ . Then a function from $A$ to $B$ , $f:A\rightarrow B$ , is a relation with the property that each element of the domain is related to exactly one element of the image, such that $Dom_f=A$ and $Img_f\subseteq B$ . Well, if we accept those definitions, functions are just special sets of ordered pairs (remember, functions are relations and, as far as I know, this is emphasized in most books). Specifying the set of inputs and the set of outputs is just necessary when describing functions using the axiom of replacement of ZFC, but what really dictates which set is which is its elements. Thus, for example, the function \begin{align}f:\{0,1\}&\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\0&\mapsto2\\1&\mapsto 3\end{align} and the function \begin{align}g:\{0,1\}&\rightarrow \{2,3\}\\0&\mapsto2\\1&\mapsto 3\end{align} are the same, since both are the set $\{(0,2),(1,3)\}$ . The thing is that $g$ is considered a surjection while $f$ is not. And this is really a problem. Furthermore, the concept of a graph of a function $Gr(f)$ , which is the set $\{(x,f(x))|x\in Dom_f\}$ , loses its sense, since the graph would be the function itself. Wouldn't be much better to define the function as an ordered triple $(A,B,f)$ , where $A$ is the domain, $B$ the codomain and $f$ the relation with the properties described above? It's different, since $f$ itself would not be a function, but only the ordered triple would. Then we could define $Gr((A,B,f)):=f$ . In this case, the graph of the function would be a relation instead of the function.
Also, the notation $f:A\rightarrow B$ could still be used to describe $(A,B,f)$ . To force the function to be a relation, we would have to define relation the same way: the relation would also be an ordered triple $(A,B,R)$ , where $R \subseteq A\times B$ . But in this case, the relation is not a set of ordered pairs, but the 'graph of the relation' is. The third and last option is to define both relation and function as a set of ordered pairs, as usually. But although injectivity is a property of a function, surjectivity would rather be a relation between a function $f$ and another given set $B$ called codomain. Am I getting it right? If so, what is the best way to define a function? Define a function not as a relation but a triple or define a relation not as  a set of ordered pairs but a triple? Or another option?","['education', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition', 'discrete-mathematics', 'functions']"

1473211,Deriving topology from sequence convergence/limits?,"Normally convergence of a series and the limit of a convergent series are defined relative to a topology. That is, you start with a topology, and then you define a series as convergent based on that topology, using the well known definition: A series $(a_n)$ converges to $a$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $a$ there's an $m\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n>m$, $a_n\in N$. Now I'm thinking about whether it is possible to reverse that process: Start with a declaration which series are divergent, and what is the limit of all convergent series, and then use that to define a topology, by simply reversing the above definition: A set $N$ is a neighbourhood of a point $a$ if for every series $(a_n)$ converging to $a$ there exists an $m\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n>m$, $a_n\in N$. More formally, a limit function for a set $M$ would be defined as a function
$$ l: \mathbb N^M \to M\cup \{\text{divergent}\}$$
mapping all sequences of values in $M$ either to a value in $M$ (saying that the value converges to that value) or to the special value $\text{divergent}\notin M$ (saying that the sequence is divergent, of course). That function, to be considered a limit, would of course have to fulfil some requirements to count as limit functions. I think an obvious set of conditions would be: For the constant sequence $(a) = (a,a,a,a,a,\ldots)$, $l((a)) = a$. If $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ differ in only finitely many terms, then $l((a_n))=l((b_n))$. If $(b_n)$ is a subsequence of $(a_n)$ and $(a_n)$ converges, then $l((b_n)) = l((a_n))$. If $c_n$ is obtained by interleaving $a_n$ and $b_n$ (where the interleaving may be in any possible way) then
$$l((c_n)) = \begin{cases}l((a_n)) & \text{if } l((a_n))=l((b_n))\\
\text{divergent} & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ Of course what remains to be shown is whether the definition above indeed results in a neighbourhood topology. Looking at the axioms given on Wikipedia, all but one are easily proved. The one I don't see how to prove is the last one: Any neighbourhood N of x contains a neighbourhood M of x such that N is a neighbourhood of each point of M. Therefore my question is: Does the above neighbourhood definition together with the ""limit axioms"" I've given above define a topology? And if not, is there some additional property of limits I've missed, adding of which to the list would be sufficient to make it a topology?","['sequences-and-series', 'general-topology']"

Because any other primitive can be written as $F(x)+C$ for some constant $C$ (and this requires a proof), if we were to denote by $\int f(x)dx$ an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then

To get a lower bound for $\mathbb{P}(X \leq \mu - \lambda)$ we can use Cantelli's lower bound on the first term.

Suppose we're working on the real line, with some Borel measure induced by a non-decreasing, right-continuous function $F$. Clearly all the points of discontinuity of $F$ are atoms (of which there may only be countably many). So if we had a non-singleton atom $A$, it would have to be uncountable. I wanted to conclude the argument by considering the set $A \setminus \{x\}$ for any $x \in  A$, but since the Borel $\sigma$-algebra isn't complete, there's no reason why I should expect that to be a measurable set. Is there a better way to see why this result might be true, or is it false? Edit: I think I figured it out. Suppose $A$ is an atomic with positive measure $\epsilon$. Then if we partition the real line into half-open intervals of measure less than $\epsilon$, then the intersection of $A$ with one of these intervals should be a proper subset of $A$, with positive measure.

If helpful, we can assume that we're given the prime factorization of $n$ .

It's frustrating, too, because this is supposed to be an easy exercise, and intuitively, it makes sense that the absolute minimum needed to cover $A \cup B$ should also be the absolute minimum needed to cover $A$ plus the absolute minimum needed to cover $B$, but I need to show this in a mathematically rigorous way, and can't just assert things without being able to mathematically explain them.

When $|G|$ < k, let us adopt the convention that $p(G,k) = 1$. This probability, or a slightly modified version of it that doesn't require the $k$ elements to be distinct, has been studied before and there are results about specific groups and what happens as $|G|$ tends to $\infty$. I'm particularly interested in the following questions but I haven't been able to find any references about them: Is the isomorphism class of $G$ determined by the sequence $p(G,k)$ where $k$ runs over the positive integers? For a fixed $k>0$, what is the distribution of the set $B_k = \{p(G,k) ~|~ G \text{ a finite group}\}$ in $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$? Is it dense in $[0,1]$? Is it all of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$? I'm primarily interested in the first question, but it seems like most of the literature on this has focused on questions more similar to the second. For the second question, if we take the simple case $k=1$, we see that $B_1 = \{\phi(n)/n ~|~ n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}$ since $p(G,1)$ is $0$ if $G$ is not cyclic and $\phi(n)/n$ if $G$ is cyclic of order $n$. It's easy to see that this is not all of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ but (if my analysis isn't failing me) it should be dense in $[0,1]$. For $k=2$, I believe it is known that as $|G|$ increases, $p(G,2)$ tends to $1$. But there are groups of large order that still have $p(G,2)$ smaller than, say, $1/2$, so I don't think we can immediately rule out the potential density of $B_2$ with just this. In general, I don't think the answer to the second question should be impacted if we change the definition of $p(G,k)$ to allow for repeated elements, since this should only change $p(G,k)$ very slightly when $|G| >> k$. The other definition might be easier to work with, but I didn't like the ""noise"" that was introduced by allowing us to, say, pick the identity element $k$ times.","['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'combinatorics']"

1474272,Expectation of Double Dice Throw,"I was wondering about finding expected value of dice throw. I know that in case of single dice throw,the expected value is 3.5 = ((1+2+3+4+5+6)/6). So for purpose of betting the base price could be 3.5 to ensure no profit and no loss scenario. But how can I extend this logic for double dice throw or N dice throw. I though that for case of double dice out of the 36 cases, I could take the maximum value for each pair which would give 6 eleven times, 5 nine times, 4 seven times, 3 five times , 2 three times and 1 once. But this gave expected value to be 4.47, whereas the correct answer in book is 4.25. How can I determine the fair value in this case?","['probability', 'expectation']"

I would like an explicit proof. My trial: Attempt 1. Does the fact that a linear continuum is densely ordered imply convex? That for every $a,b$ such that $a < b$, $[a,b]$ belongs to the linear continuum. Attempt 2. Or are all sets convex sets of itself? Definitions. A simply ordered set L having more than one element is called a linear continuum if the following hold: (1) $L$ has the least upper bound property (2) If $x<y$, there exists z such that x A subspace $Y$ of $L$ is said to be convex if for every pair of points $a,b$ of $Y$ with $a<b$, the entire interval $[a,b]$ of points of $L$ lies in $Y$.",['general-topology']

1474326,Every Manifold is Locally Path Connected,"I'm trying to prove that every topological manifold $M^n$ (with or without boundary) is locally path-connected. My attempt: (Without boundary): Let $x\in M^n$ and $V$ be any open set containing $x$. Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart containing $x$, so $U\cap V$ is also open, and $U\cap V$ is homeomorphic to $\phi(U\cap V)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, which may or may not be path-connected. If it is path-connected, then $U\cap V= \phi^{-1}(\phi(U\cap V)\subset V$ is path connected, since path-connectectedness is preserved under homeomorphism and we are done. If $\phi(U\cap V)$ is not path-connected, then since it is open, we can find a sufficiently small $r$ so $B_r(\phi(x))\subset \phi(U\cap V)$. $B_r(\phi(x))$ is path-connected, so $x\in\phi^{-1}(B_r(\phi(x)))\subset V$ is path-connected. (With Boundary): Let $\mathbb{H}^n=\{(x^1,...,x^n)\in\mathbb{R}^n:x^n=0\}.$ Replace $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mathbb{H}^n$ and $B_r(\phi(x))$ with $\mathbb{H}^n\cap B_r(\phi(x))$ in the argument above.

I tried using cosine law:
$$AD\times AD = c^2 +(s-b)^2 -2c(s-b)\cos B\\
BE\times BE = a^2 + (s-c)^2 -2a(s-c)\cos C\\
CF\times CF = b^2 + (s-a)^2 -2b(s-a)\cos A\\$$

1474414,Subspace of a compactly generated space?,"Consider the following two exercises in May's A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. (a) Any subspace of a weak Hausdorff space is weak Hausdorff. (b) Any closed subspace of a $k$ -space is a $k$ -space. (c) An open subset $U$ of a compactly generated space $X$ is compactly generated if each point has an open neighborhood in $X$ with closure contained in $U$ . A Tychonoff (or completely regular) space $X$ is a $T_1$ -space (points are closed) such that for each point $x \in X$ and each closed subset $A$ such that $x \notin A$ , there is a function $f: X \to I$ such that $f(x) = 0$ and $f(a) = 1$ if $a \in A$ . Prove the following. (a) A space is Tychonoff if and only if it can be embedded in a cube (a product of copies of $I$ ). (b) There are Tychonoff spaces that are not $k$ -spaces, but every cube is a compact Hausdorff space. In view of these two problems, what should one mean by a ""subspace"" of a compactly generated space? We do not want to restrict the allowable subsets.","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"
