1604925,Square and cubic roots in $\mathbb Q(\sqrt n)$,"Here is my question : Let $n$ a squarefree positive integer, $m \ge 2$ an integer and $a+b \sqrt n \in\mathbb Q (\sqrt n).$ What (sufficient or necessary) conditions should $a$ and $b$ satisfy so that $a+b \sqrt n$ has a $m$-th root in $\mathbb Q (\sqrt n)$? Here is my attempt :
I tried the case $m=2$. If $\sqrt{a+b \sqrt n} = c+d\sqrt n$ with $c,d \in \mathbb Q$ then
$$ a=c^2+d^2n, b=2cd. $$ Assuming $b \neq 0$, I get $c^2 + n\left(\frac{b}{2c}\right)^2 = a$, and for instance $c = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-nb^2}}{2}}$, so it is necessary to have $\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-nb^2}}{2}$ is a square in $\mathbb Q$ (and then $d$ is also rational). We may find better conditions than this one. But I don't know how to manage with the cases $m \ge 3$, because the calculations become difficult. Is there some theoretical approach (e.g. Galois theory) to treat this problem ? Thank you !","['number-theory', 'radicals', 'nested-radicals', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
1604929,Matching problem expectation and variance,"The matching problem : Suppose $n$ gentlemen go out for dinner and leave their hats in the cloakroom.  After the dinner (and several glasses of wine) they pick their hats completely randomly.  Denote by $X$ the number of gentlemen who take their own hats.  Find $E[X]$ and $Var[X]$. I have seen many answers to this: $E[X] = \sum_i^nE(I_i)= \sum_i^n 1/n = 1$, where $I_i$ is the indicator for each person which equals $1$ if the person takes his hat own hat and $0$ otherwise. I don't understand how the probability of $I_i$ can be $1/n$ for all of $I_i$.  Consider the third gentleman to take a hat; wouldn't the probability he take his hat be $1/(n-3)$ rather than $1/n$?","['expectation', 'probability', 'random-variables']"
1604935,Backgrounds of the p-Laplacian Operator,"Motivation I encountered the following partial differential equation (PDE) in a mathematical paper $$\begin{array}{}
u_{tt}+\Delta^2u-\nabla\cdot\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\right)-\Delta u_{t}+\int_{0}^{t}g(t-s)\Delta u(x,s) ds=f(x,u,u_{t}) & \text{in} & \partial \Omega \times (0,T) \\
u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0 & \text{on} & \partial \Omega \times [0,T) \\
u(x,0)=u_0(x), \qquad u_{t}(x,0)=v_0(x) & \text{in} & \partial \Omega
\end{array} $$ where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous boundary $\partial \Omega$. Also, $g \ge 0$ is called memory kernel that decays with a general rate and $f(x,u,u_t)$ is some nonlinear function. $p \ge 2$ is a real constant. The differential operators $\Delta$, $\Delta^2$ and $\nabla$ are the Laplacian, the Biharmonic and gradient operators, respectively. We are interested in the case $n=3$ which has a physical meaning. Now, let us go into some physical insights. Plates are initially flat structural members bounded by two parallel planes, called faces, and a cylindrical surface, called an edge or boundary. The generators of the cylindrical surface are perpendicular to the plane faces. The deck of a ship is an example of a plate. This PDE is describing the lateral displacement of a plate made of a homogeneous isotropic nonelinear viscoelastic material. The function $u(x,t)$ is the lateral displacement of the plate at position $x$ and time $t$. I know that in classical linear elasticity , the following equation $$u_{tt}+\Delta^2u=f(x) \tag{1}$$ describes the lateral displacement of a plate made of a homogeneous isotropic elastic material where $f(x)$ is an external force applied to the plate and $u_{tt}$ describes the inertia or acceleration term. It is also known as the equation for vibration of plates. I found from this paper that if we have structural damping then the term $\Delta u_t$ shows up in $(1)$. Also, an article in wikipedia revealed that the integral term $\int_{0}^{t}g(t-s)\Delta u(x,s) ds$ can show up in $(1)$ when viscoelasticity comes in. What remains unknown is $$\Delta_p u \equiv \nabla\cdot\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\right)$$ which is called the p-Laplacian operator. For $p=2$, it is the usual Laplacian operator $\Delta$. I really cannot find any background of this operator. Question Can you please shed some light on the physical , mathematical or historical background of the p-Laplacian term? Where does it come from?

1604956,Sequence of compactly supported functions approximating $x^2$,"I encountered this question as part of a proof I am working on and was wondering whether anybody has an explicit way to construct these sequences: 1.) Is there a sequence of positive compactly supported functions $f_n \in C_c^2(\mathbb{R_{\ge 0}})$ with $||f_n''|| \le 2$ such that $f_n(x) \rightarrow x^2$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}.$ 2.) Is there a sequence of positive compactly supported functions $f_n \in C_c^2(\mathbb{R_{\ge 0}})$ with $|f_n''(x)| \le x^2$ and $f_n(x) \rightarrow \frac{x^4}{12}$? I mean figuratively, you need to construct functions that approximate the respective function on some interval $[-n,n]$ quite well and decay to $0$ on $[-m-n,-n] \cup [n,n+m]$ in a way that is not too fast. But how one could do this explicitly is really the big issue here.","['real-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"
1604957,Largest-area shape with diameter 1?,"Define the diameter of a shape as the greatest distance between any two of its points.  What diameter 1 shape has the greatest area? Is it the circle? I've been looking for the biggest little polyhedron for awhile, and looked at biggest little polygon again. A paper by Henrion and Messine extended results to the 16-gon.  The trend shows that the best area is chaotic, with the optimal 14-gon having a better improvement over the regular 14-gon by a factor higher than shown in the 8, 10, and 12 gons. If the trend continues, there may be a unit thrackle that generates a 50-gon to 90-gon of diameter 1 with a total area greater than a circle of diameter 1. It might be possible faster than that, by using Reuleaux polygon methods. What diameter-1 shape has the greatest area?

1605061,Pythagorean triples with the same c value,"$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ There are, Primitive Pythagorean Triples, that share the same c value. For example, 
$63^2 + 16^2 = 65^2$ and $33 ^2 + 56^2 = 65^2$. I have been trying to figure out why the following theorem for finding such triples works. Take any set of primes. Ex: $5,13,17$. Now take their product, $1052$, this is the new $c^2$ value. You can express that $c^2$ value as a triple by factoring the product of primes as Gaussian Integers: $(2-i)(2+i)(3+2i)(3-2i)(4+i)(4-i)$ Now if you take three of those Gaussian Integers and solve for their product: ex, $(2+i)(3+2i)(4+i) = 9+32i$ and you have found an $a$ value $9$ and a $b$ value $32$ that works in the theorem. $9^2 + 32^2 = 1105$ You can continue with this: $(2-i)(3+2i)(4+i) = a + bi$ $(2+i)(3-2i)(4+i) = a + bi$ $(2+i)(3+2i)(4-i) = a + bi$ In fact, the number of triples with this method is $2^{||p|| - 1}$ where $||p||$ is the number of primes used. Can someone please explain why this method of finding these ""c stuck triples"" works the way it does?

We want to show that $\sup_n ||X_n||_p < \infty$ for some $p> 1$ implies uniform integrability. $$\sup_{n} E[|X_n| 1_{|X_n|>M} ] \leq \sup_{n} E[|X_n|] \leq \sup_{n} E[|X_n|^p],$$
using Jensen. Since $\sup_n ||X_n||_p < \infty$, we also have $\sup_n E[|X_n|^p] < \infty$, and the claim follows by letting $M \rightarrow \infty$. Now we want to show that a finite family of random variables in $L^1$ is always uniformly integrable. Let $n \in N$ for some finite set $N$. Define $$M_0:=\max_{n \in N} |X_n|.$$ Then we have $$E[|X_n| 1_{|X_n|>M_0}]= E[|X_n|\cdot 0 ] = 0,$$
and hence we can take the $sup$ to get for all $M \geq M_0$ that $$\sup_n E[|X_n| 1_{|X_n|> M}] = 0.$$ The result follows by taking the limit $M \rightarrow \infty$. 
Do we need here something like monotonce or dominated convergence? Is this proof valid? If not, how would one prove it? is there a more elegant way of proving it? When $E[\sup_n |X_n|] < \infty$, then the sequence is uniformly integrable. How can one interchange order of $\sup$ and expectation?

This is a soft-question , because it's a loose ""does this idea make sense"" kind of question, instead of ""solve this problem"".) I've been thinking about sequences of groups that, in some sense, appear to get closer and closer to some infinite group that has all of the previous groups as subgroups. For example, the sequence $$\mathbb Z_2,~~~ \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2,~~~ \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2,~~~ \dots$$ in a certain sense approaches the group $\mathbb Z_2^\infty$ (I'm not sure if it has a more common symbol) of infinite binary strings under the bitwise XOR operation. Similarly, the sequence $$S_1,~ S_2,~ S_3,~ \dots$$ approaches $S_\mathbb N$, the symmetric group on all natural numbers. So you could be silly and write: $\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S_\mathbb N$. Does the pattern I'm seeing make any sense? I'm interested to see if these ""sorta-limits"" can be given a more rigorous definition. Is there some way to define the ""distance"" between two groups, so that the usual definition 1 for sequences can apply to them, and do the above patterns work out under that definition?

\int_{\partial F} \textbf{r}\times\mathrm{d}\textbf{r} = \int_F \textbf{r} \cdot \textrm{d}\textbf{n}
$$ But isn't Stoke's theorem the other way around, having the cross product (or exterior derivative) on the side of the surface? Q1: What is the confusion here? EDIT: F is a surface in $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \{0\}$, which makes $\partial F$ a closed curve in said space. $\mathbf{r}$ denotes the position vector. $\mathbf{e_z}$ is the third vector of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$. The first part will probably be trivial to answer, but since I often get confused by such details, I'd like to take the approach using differential forms and the exterior derivative. So I tried to calculate, $r$ being a 1-form: $$
\mathrm{d}(\textbf{r}\wedge\mathrm{d}\textbf{r}) = \mathrm{d}\textbf{r} \wedge \mathrm{d}\textbf{r} + (-1)^1 \textbf{r}\wedge\mathrm{d}\mathrm{d}\textbf{r} = 0 + 0 = 0
$$
Using that $\wedge$ is bilinear and $\mathrm{d}^2=0$.
That cannot be true though, since the integral is nonzero. Q2: where does the mistake of that approach lie?","['multivariable-calculus', 'stokes-theorem', 'analysis']"

  $S \backslash \{s_1\}$ is nonempty and there exists a $s_2 \in S
 \backslash \{s_1\}$ Since $S$ is infinite, $S \backslash \{s_1, s_2\}$ is nonempty and
  there exists a $s_3 \in S \backslash \{s_1,s_2\}$ Continuing this way gives a list $(s_n)$ of distinct elements of $S$.
  The set of these elements forms a denumerable subset of $S$ Three questions: Continuing this way...wouldn't we end up with an infinite list $(s_n) = \{s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots\}$ which is back to our set $S$? Why don't we just stop at $\{s_1\}$? $\{s_1\}$ is in $S$, it is a singleton, it is countable, the end. We already know that infinite sets are denumerable, meaning we can consturct a bijection $f(k) = s_k,  \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$.

I continued with ""A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern
Recognition"" by Christopher JC Burges and stumbled over the following (please not that $x \cdot y$ is the dot product): Now suppose we first mapped the data to
  some other (possibly infinite dimensional) Euclidean space $\mathcal{H}$, using a mapping which we
  will call $\Phi$:
  $$\Phi : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$$
  Then of course the training algorithm would only depend on the data through dot products
  in $\mathcal{H}$, i.e. on functions of the form $\Phi(\mathbf{x}_i)\cdot \Phi(\mathbf{x}_j)$. Now if there were a “kernel function” $K$
  such that $K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) = \Phi(\mathbf{x}_i)\cdot\Phi(\mathbf{x}_j)$, we would only need to use $K$ in the training algorithm,
  and would never need to explicitly even know what $\Phi$ is. One example is
  $$K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j ) = e^{- \| \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\|^2 / 2 \sigma^2}$$
  In this particular example, $\mathcal{H}$ is infinite dimensional, so it would not be very easy to work
  with $\Phi$ explicitly. I have three questions which are closely related to this. I am happy with any answer which answers any of my questions: Why would $\mathcal{H}$ be infinitely dimensional in this case? What is $\Phi$ in this case?

1606113,Null-correlation and Tango bundles on $\mathbb{P}^3$,"Let $V$ be a four-dimensional complex vector space and $\mathbb{P}^3=\mathbb{P}(V)$. There are two interesting bundles $N$ and $T$ on $\mathbb{P}^3$, both of rank 2, called respectively a null-correlation bundle and a Tango bundle. Let me briefly remind the construction. Taking symplectic form $\omega$ on $V$, the null-correlation bundle $N$ is defined by the exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-1)\stackrel{\varphi}\to\Omega_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(1)\to N\to0,$$
where $\varphi$ is constructed in the following way: there is a complex
$$0\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-1)\to V\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\stackrel{\pi}\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(1)\to0$$
in which the map $\pi$ is given by the composition $V\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\stackrel{\omega}\to V^*\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(1)$ and thus we obtain the map $\varphi:\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-1)\to\text{ker}(V^*\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(1))=\Omega_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(1)$. To define the Tango bundle $F$ we start from the Euler exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-1)\to V\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to T_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-1)\to0$$
and the second exterior power of it, which is
$$0\to T_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-2)\to\bigwedge^2V\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to\bigwedge^2T_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-2)\to0.$$ We have that $E:=\bigwedge^2T_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-2)$  is rank-3 vector bundle generated by global sections, $K:=H^0(\mathbb{P}^3, E)\cong\bigwedge^2V$ and $c_3(E)=0$. Consider $Y=\{(s,x)\in\mathbb{P}(K)\times\mathbb{P}(V)| s(x)=0\}$, which is a 5-dimensional subvariety in $\mathbb{P}(K)\times\mathbb{P}(V)$. Thus by the proof of Lemma4.3.2 from the book ""Vector Bundles on Complex Projective Spaces"" of Okonek, Schneider and Spindler, the projection map $p:Y\to\mathbb{P}(K)$ is not a surfection, thus any $s\in\mathbb{P}(K)\setminus p(Y)$ gives an injective map of bundles $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to E$, thus we obtain the exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(V)}\to\bigwedge^2T_{\mathbb{P}(V)}(-2)\to F\to0.$$ Now, since $\bigwedge^2T_{\mathbb{P}^3}(-2)\cong\Omega_{\mathbb{P}^3}(2)$ it seems that $F\cong N(1)$.

Moreover, any group of order $n$ is bounded. To see this, the claim is made that $s(g) \leq n$ for all $g \in G$. To see this, consider the set $ \{ g, g^{2}, \ldots, g^{n + 1} \}$. By pigeonhole, there exist $1 \leq i < j \leq n + 1$ such that $g^{i} = g^{j}$, so $g^{j - i} = e$; then $s(g) \leq j - i \leq n$. Thus $\Theta(G) \leq n$. Initially, I conjectured that a set was bounded off it was finite, considering the multiplicative group $\{ e^{iq} : q \in \mathbb{Q} \}$, where $s(g)$ is always finite, but unbounded. Then I dismissed this considering $G = \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{I}$, where $I$ is an infinite indexing set and $\Theta(G) = 2$. I revised this to the claim that a group $G$ is bounded if and if it can be written as a product $G = \prod_{i \in I} H_{i}$ of finite groups for some index set $I$, where $\sup \{ \# H_{i} : i \in I \} < \infty$. I believe I know how to show any factoring of $G$ into finite groups would satisfy this, but I can't show that every bounded group is factorable into finite groups, i.e. can't show there doesn't exist a bounded group which cannot be expressed as a product of finite groups. Is this correct? If so, how might I show it? If not, is there a counterexample? Thanks.","['finite-groups', 'examples-counterexamples', 'conjectures', 'group-theory']"

1606513,Concrete Mathematics 2.10 - 2.13 Cannot find part of the solution,"I've seen a few other questions on this section, but none match my issue, I feel like I'm missing something super obvious. Everything in here seems to make sense, I can follow along everything, except I'm missing part of the answer (at the end of post; most of the middle part might not be needed by the experts). ""Background"" also should not be needed, as the ""Starting Point"" is confirmed in the book, but it is generally described just in case. Background: Equation starts as this: (1st) $ C_0 = C_1 = 0 $ $$ C_n = n+1 + \frac{2}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}C_k \hspace{3mm}for\hspace{2mm}n > 1$$
After multiplying both sides by $ n $(2nd), $n$ is replaced by $n-1$(3rd) and the 3rd equation is subtracted from the 2nd, yielding the equation below which is in a ""special form"" of $ aT_{n} = bT_{n-1} + c $ (if anyone knows the name of this form or 'trick' I'd like to know). Starting Point:
$$
C_0 = C_1 = 0, C_2 = 3
$$
$$
nC_n = (n+1)C_{n-1} + 2n \hspace{3mm}for\hspace{2mm}n > 2
$$
So $ a=n, b=n+1, c=2n$. The summation factor ($ s_n $) ends up being $ \frac{2}{(n+1)n} $ Setting $ S_n = s_na_nT_n $ yields $ S_n = S_{n-1} + s_nc_n$
And then you put this into a sum:
$$
S_n = s_1b_1T_0 + \sum_{k=1}^ns_kc_k
$$
$$
S_n = ( (\frac{2}{2}\times 2 \times 0) + \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{2}{(k+1)k}2k)
$$
Isolate sum by undoing summation factor:
$$
T_n = \frac{1}{s_na_n}(s_1b_1T_0 + \sum_{k=1}^ns_kc_k)
$$
$$
T_n = \frac{(n+1)n}{2n}( (\frac{2}{2}\times 2 \times 0) + \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{2}{(k+1)k}2k)
$$
When I calculate this out, I get $ s_1b_1T_0  = 0$ (because $T_0 = 0$, (right?))  and multiplying out the sum yields (My Answer) : $$
C_n = 2(n+1)\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k+1}
$$ Which is close to the actual answer, which is $$
C_n = 2(n+1)\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k+1} - \frac{2}{3}(n+1)\hspace{3mm}for\hspace{2mm}n > 1
$$ I cannot figure out where the $ -\frac{2}{3}(n+1)$ comes from. I'm guessing maybe it's from the $ s_1b_1T_0 $ but cannot seem to get that to work, even if I set 0 to be 2 or something. (Starting with a different index as suggested by another post, but doesn't make too much sense to me to do that) What am I doing wrong/missing? Been trying to figure this out much too long, and I'm about to go crazy.. Seems like missing multiplicand is $ -\frac{4}{3} $ but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I'm trying various ideas to make $s_1b_1T_0 = -\frac{4}{3}$. $s_1b_1 = 2$ so $T_0$ logically should be $-\frac{2}{3}$, but I don't see how. Interestingly, plugging $n=0$ into the final answer yields $-\frac{2}{3}$ but that info isn't available until it's solved.","['summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1606709,Kähler differential and higher derivations (geometric interpretation of diagonal here),"I am studing Kähler differentials and I tried to understand the geometric motivation behind these settings. What I do not understand is the role which plays the diagonal in all these theory. The cotangent sheaf is later defined in terms of the diagonal map. Why is this geometrically interesting? I tried to write a short introduction to Kähler differential to make the geometric nature more available, but I do not now if it make sense. Here it is: Differential $ 1 $-forms are linear transformations $ \omega_{p}:T_p X\mapsto K $  assigning an element in $ K $ to a tangent vector of the tangent space $ T_p X $ of a point $ p\in X $ in some differential manifold $ X $. Differential $ 1 $-forms can be viewed as \textit{infinitesimal} direction vectors $ \triangle p $. This means in physical terms, that the scalar $ \omega_p(\triangle t)\in K $ with $ \triangle t $ a tangent vector represents the \textit{work} required to move from $ x_i $ to $ x_{i+1} $ with $ p\in (x_i,x_{i+1}) $ along some curve. In other words, differential forms are cotangent vectors over some field $ K $, which give information about the work which is locally required to move along some curve. However, they can be generalized and captured by sheaf theory. For this attempt, we observe first that $ \triangle p $ is related to Taylor expansions. Indeed, let $ f $ be a smooth function, that is $ f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}) $, on a differential manifold $ X$ and let $\mathfrak{J}$ be the ideal of smooth functions vanishing at the point $p\in X$. The zero order part of the Taylor series of a smooth function $f$ is the value of $f$ at the point $ p $, let us say, $ f(p)=c $, so that $ f-c\in\mathfrak{J}$. Now the first order derivatives of $f-c$ correspond to the first order terms in the Taylor series and these are given by the image of $f$ in $\mathfrak{J}/\mathfrak{J}^2$. Let us denote this map by $ d(f) $ with $ d: \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathfrak{J}/\mathfrak{J}^2 $ and where $ \mathcal{O}_X $ denotes the ring of smooth functions on $ X $. Moreover, if $ f $ is constant, this means a fixed vector, then $ d(f)=0 $. Another important input is that $ \triangle p$ is required to be non zero, as there is no direction available for the zero vector. But $ \triangle p=0 $ is satisfied if and only if the two endpoints of the tangent vector $ \triangle p $ are choosen to be the same, which happens if and only if the point $ p\in X $ correspond to an element on the diagonal of $ X\times X $. So we demand that we just consider elements in $ X\times X $ vanishing on the diagonal (or in the complement of the diagonal). Summarizing up, my two questions are the following: 1) which geoemtric interpretation have the diagonal in these context? 2) Higher derivations seemed to me a generalization of Kähler differentials, but what is their motivation or geometric nature (analogy to differential geometry), since I cannot see any connection between Kähler differentials and higher derivations ?","['complex-geometry', 'sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1606793,Properties of Weak Convergence of Probability Measures on Product Spaces,"EDIT: For the Bounty, I made a substantial edit revision concerning the structure of the question, to make it more readable (hopefully). Moreover I added a question on problem 2.7 of  Billingsley’s book. I have two problems concerning weak convergence of probability measures in product spaces , that arose from Billingsley’s classic  “Convergence of Probability Measures” (Chapter I, Section 2, Subsection “Product Spaces”). Below there are the part of the book that made me wonder, the numbered questions I have, plus my thoughts (hidden, in order to lighten the overall immediate reading of the question). Notation: $P$ is a probability measure on $T = S' \times S''$ , $P_n \Rightarrow P$ denotes weak convergence, while a $P$ -continuity set is the family of those sets $A \in \mathcal{S}$ such that $P(\partial A)= 0$ , where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of $S$ , and $\partial A$ denotes the boundary of $A$ . Concerning product spaces , $\mathcal{T} :=  \mathcal{S}' \times \mathcal{S}''$ is the $\sigma$ -algebra of $T$ , while $P’$ is the marginal distribution on $\mathcal{S}’$ of $P$ on $\mathcal{T}$ , defined as $P’ (A) := P(A \times S’’)$ (and the same applies to $P’’$ ). I PART The first problem is with the following Billingsley’s statement in bold . [Theorem 2.8.ii. should be a sort of a partial converse of the – trivial – following proposition, here named in the following way: Proposition 1: If $P_n \Rightarrow P$ , then $P^{'}_n \Rightarrow P'$ , and $P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P’’$ .] Therefore, we have the following theorem, in which (ii) is an obvious consequence of (i). Theorem 2.8. (i) If $T = S' \times S''$ is separable, then $P_n \Rightarrow P$ if and only if $P_ n (A’ \times A’’) \to P(A' \times  A'')$ for each $P’$ -continuity set $A’$ and each $P’’$ -continuity set $A''$ . (ii) If $T$ is separable, then $P^{'}_n \times P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P’ \times P’’$ if and only if $P^{'}_n \Rightarrow P'$ and $P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P’’$ . II PART The Second problem concerns problem 2.7 in the book, that reads: Problem 2.7: The uniform distribution on the unit square and the uniform distribution on its diagonal have identical marginal distributions. Relate this to Theorem 2.8. Questions: How do we prove (ii)? 1.a. How do we prove the ( $\Leftarrow$ ) direction of (ii)? 1.b. How do we actually use (i) to prove (ii), as Billingsley suggests? 1.c. Is my way of addressing the problem below sound? How do we actually relate problem 2.7 to theorem 2.8? 2.a. Do we actually have to use the setting in the problem to come up with some measure that works as a counterexample of Proposition 1 , or 2.b. It is enought to notice that the weak limit is now not unique, and hence the converse of proposition 1 does not hold anymore? Here my thoughts on question 1: Attempted proof of (ii): (only if) Assume that $P^{'}_n \times P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P' \times P’’$ . Thus, by taking the marginals $P'$ , and $P''$ on $P^{'}_n \times P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P' \times P''$ , we obtain that $P{'}_n \Rightarrow P’$ , and $P{''}_n \Rightarrow P''$ . (if) Assume that $P^{'}_n \Rightarrow P'$ , and $P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P''$ . Let $A' \in \mathcal{S}'$ , $A'' \in \mathcal{S}'$ be arbitrary, such that $A'$ is a $P'$ -continuity set, and $A''$ is a $P''$ -continuity set. [… and here it ends. I thought that we could use the Portmanteau theorem to get somewhere from the fact that $P^{'}_n \Rightarrow P'$ , and $P^{''}_n \Rightarrow P''$ , but I really don't know.] As always, thank you for your time.","['self-learning', 'probability-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'products', 'measure-theory']"
