1595853,Intuitive explanation of left- and right-inverse,"I am reading about right-inverse and left-inverse matrices. According to theory if a matrix $A_{m\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ is full row rank, then it has a right-inverse. That is, $AC=I_{m}$. Similarly, if $A$ is full collumn rank, then it has a left-inverse. That is, $BA=I_{n}$. I have the following questions: Taking $AC=I_{m}\iff A^TAC=A^T \iff C=(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$ but this satisfies $CA=I$, contradiction. Similarly, taking $BA=I_{n}\iff BAA^T=A^T \iff B=A^T(AA^T)^{-1}$ but this satisfies $AB=I$, contradiction. How is that possible? Moreover, and most importantly what is the intuitive explanation of the left and right inverse? Is there any connection with the rows or collumns or any of the four foundamental subspaces of $A$?

1595894,Using polar coordinates to find the area of an ellipse,"Considering an ellipse with the $x$ radius equal to $a$ and the $y$ radius equal to b $:$ I figured that some kind of parameterization might be: $x=a\cos\theta$ $y=b\sin\theta$ and then polar $r^2$ is just $x^2 + y^2$ But then I tried to come up with some unit of infinitesimal area using triangles $\left(\dfrac{d\theta r^2}{2}\right)$ which does not give the correct answer. I read somewhere that my polar coordinates are wrong and that they are actually $x=ar\cos\theta$ $y=br\sin\theta$ But this does not make sense to me as an engineer because that seems like it would have the dimension of area equal to the dimension of a distance. The integral also takes $r$ from $0$ to $1$ which I thought was eliminated because the equation for $r$ should be in terms of $\theta$ and the constants $a$ and $b.$ I would like some explanation of what I am doing wrong that would make some ""physical"" sense (or why physical intuition might fail for this problem)","['physics', 'calculus', 'integration', 'geometry', 'conic-sections']"

  $$
 A \times B = \{(x,y) : x \in A \wedge y \in B\}.
$$ In the definition of the cartesian product, the cartesian product can't be made from two empty sets. The two sets should be nonempty. But in the following question the empty set $\emptyset$ makes up the two cartesian products, $A \times \emptyset$ and $\emptyset \times A$. I strongly feel that the the word nonempty should be removed from Definition 1. What do you think of Definition 1? Is it a complete definition for the cartesian product? Question: Let A be any set. Find $A \times \emptyset$ and $\emptyset \times A$. Solution: Since $A \times \emptyset$ is set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a \in A$ and $b \in \emptyset$​, and since the empty set $\emptyset$ contains no elements there is no $b \in \emptyset$; therefore $A × \emptyset = \emptyset$.

However, I cannot think of an example where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is zero, but the graph does not change signs. There is some information about undulation points available, but the descriptions are fairly vague: What is the difference between an undulation point and other critical values?

If $d - 2$ is odd, set $u := (1 + p + \ldots + p^{d-1})$ and then proceed

 & \frac{u(1 + p + \ldots + p^{d-2})}{p+1} \\

 & = u + p^2\cdot \left( \frac{u(1+p) + u(p^2 + \ldots p^{d-4})}{p+1} \right) \\
 & = u + p^2\cdot \left( u + p^2\cdot \frac{u(1+p+\ldots p^{d-6})}{p+1} \right) \\
 & \quad \qquad\qquad \vdots \\
 & = u + p^2\cdot \left( u + p^2 \left( u + p^2\left( u + \ldots + p^2 \frac{u(1+p)}{1+p} \right) \right) \right) \\
 & = u + p^2\cdot ( u + p^2 \cdot ( u + p^2 ( u + \ldots + p^2 u ))) \\
 & \equiv u \pmod{p} \\
 & \equiv 1 \pmod{p}

and similar if $d-1$ is odd then successively multiply $(1+p+\ldots + p^{d-1})$ out with $v := (1+p+\ldots p^{d-2})$.

 Then our random variable has more than a 50-50 chance of being within $3^{-n-1}$ of a member of $T_n$.  As the number of intervals grows as $2^n$, and their width shrinks as $3^{-n}$, the measure of the whole thing goes to 0 as $n$ goes to infinity.

Here (I think) you can put a sheaf on the literal cartesian product $G \times G$ to make $G \times G$ into an algebraic scheme which is a categorical product with respect to the restriction maps (which will also be morphisms). The pair $(G,m)$ is called a group object if there exist morphisms $e: \ast \rightarrow G$ and $\iota:G \rightarrow G$ which satisfy a bunch of diagram commutativity properties.  Here $\ast$ is the one point scheme $\textrm{Max } k$.  Since morphisms of schemes are also continuous functions on the underlying topological spaces, if I consider $m$ as a continuous function on the cartesian product $G \times G$, it seems like a group object is literally a group, whose identity is the image of the function $e$.

Teaching myself differential topology and differential geometry : expounds many good references Introductory texts on manifolds recommending books for intro to diff. geometry Reference for Topology and Geometry Good introductory book on Calculus on Manifolds : This answer suggests a 'gentle' book - Topology Without Tears. It seems a good book, however, this book does not cover everything what I am looking for (and certain prerequisites as well). From these questions and their answers, I found that Milnor's Topology from a Differentiable Viewpoint , Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , Tu's An Introduction to Manifolds should work for self-study. I am not looking for a theorem and proof style book, but rather getting concepts such as topology, manifold, Lie groups, moving frames, etc. When I start reading even the introductory chapters from books, I find that many books simply assume that the reader would already know concepts as homomorphism, isomorphism, wedge product, cotangent space, etc. This assumption is not true for many readers (like I). As a result, it is not possible to move ahead without knowing these stuff. I further found that there is a large amount of literature devoted to these topics. I found, a branch of mathematics, abstract algebra, deals with homomorphism and other listed topics. Learning everything is a daunted task, in fact, only some portion might be needed for my purpose. Differential geometry and topology have diverse applications and many people, who are from in different areas of sciences and who are not pure mathematicians,  may need to learn these areas. Can someone suggest a 'self contained' introductory book that will sufficiently cover the subject-matter? If such book is not there, can someone mention references that will (quickly and with sufficient depth) cover the assumed prerequisites for learning topology and differential geometry (homomorphism, isomorphism, wedge product, cotangent space, etc.)? So that one does not have to entirely learn abstract algebra, which looks hard method. Inputs are very much appreciated!

1596669,Global sections of Proj,"In constructing the relative Proj for a graded ring $S$, one inevitably has that the distinguished opens, $D_+ (f)$, where $f \in S_+$ gives rise to a scheme that is isomorphic to $\textrm{Spec } S_{(f)}$, the latter denoting the degree zero elements in the localization $S_f$. In all constructions I have seen of this, including Hartshorne and Liu, they usually leave it at that with no mention of global sections. I was tempted to handle this by saying $f = 1$ then $D_+ (f) = \textrm{Proj } S$ is isomorphic to $\textrm{Spec } S_{(1)} = \textrm{Spec } S_0$ (degree 0 elements of $S$). The Wikipedia article mentions this without proof or justification under the ""Twisting Sheaf of Serre"" section ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proj_construction#The_twisting_sheaf_of_Serre ) lending credence to this fact. However, the condition that $f \in S_+$, where $1$ typically does not reside (take the natural grading on the polynomial ring for example) seems to invalidate this proof. What justification should I use instead?

My approach:-
               I have used logarithmic test to test the denominator sum for convergence as follows:-
$$ \lim_{ k\to\infty}k\log \frac{u_n}{u_{n+1}}=\lim_{k\to \infty}k\log\frac{2^{-k^2}}{2^{-(k+1)^2}}=\lim_{k\to\infty}(k+2k^2)\log2=\infty$$
Thus the infinite sum diverges.
The numerator term also diverges because it is a term from monotonically decreasing sequence which has no lower bound. So overall solution is $$\infty$$

In the past, with function composition, I understand associativity as follows.  Suppose that $(a, b)$ is in the graph of $f:  A \to B$; $(b, c)$ in the graph of $g:  B \to C$; $(c, d)$ in $h:  C \to D$. \begin{align}
(h \circ g)(f(a)) & = (h \circ g)(b) = h(c) = d \\
h((g \circ f)(a)) & = h(c) = d
\end{align} Hence, there is only one ""path"" in the sense that $a \mapsto b \mapsto c \mapsto d$.  But apparently if $f, g, h$ are not well-defined functions, associativity can still hold as long as there are elements taking me from $a$ to $d$.  For example: $$\begin{matrix}
a & \longrightarrow & b_1 & \longrightarrow & c_1 & \longrightarrow & d \\
& f & & g & & h & & \\
a & \longrightarrow & b_2 & \longrightarrow & c_2 & \longrightarrow & d

As pointed out in a few questions on this site and wikipedia ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), in the case where $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is a finite measure space, convergence in measure can be described by a pseudometric (hence a topology). However, I haven't found an answer to why at least a topology should exist in the case where $\mu$ is an arbitrary measure. Wikipedia ( 3 ) claims that their pseudometric works for arbitrary measures, but their proposed function can take $\infty$ as a value, which I believe isn't allowed for metrics. To sum up: let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a (not necessarily finite) measure space, does there exist a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on the set of measurable functions $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ such that a sequence of measurable functions $(f_{n})_{n}$ converges to a measurable function $f$ in measure if and only if it converges to $f$ in the topology $\mathcal{T}$? Extra: Is this topology unique? Thank you for your help! I've had introductory courses in topology (metric spaces), Banach (Hilbert) spaces and now measure theory.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1596976,Another way to evaluate $\int_0^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2}dx$,"In Stewart's Calculus book I came across the following Gaussian integral. Using $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp{(-x^2)}dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ evaluate

$$ I read in this pdf that $$
 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx =\sqrt{ \frac{\pi}{a}}
$$ and how to use differentiation under the integral sign to evaluate it (recreated below for convenience). $$
\begin{align*}
I(a) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ax^2} dx =\sqrt{ \frac{\pi}{a}} \\ I'(a)&=  -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2  e^{-ax^2}dx = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\pi} a^{-3/2} \\I'(1) &= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}

$$
\int_0^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2}dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4}

1597005,Deriving the sine function,"How can the sine function be derived/proven? The definition for $\sin(x)$ is of course given as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hyoptenuse}}$ of a right-angled triangle, which solving for $x$ can be had from the Maclaurin series: $$\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}x^{2n+1}$$ Which can be simplified to (using euler's formula, which is also derived from maclaurin series): $$\sin(x) = \large \frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}$$ But since the use of maclaurin series assumes the derivative of the sin function to be known, which requires knowing the function, the proof becomes circular. How to prove that the identity holds without resorting to this circularity? More than likely the derivation of the formula is going to use the pythagorean theorem: $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$ Where $a$ and $b$ are the sides of the right-angled triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. From this it can be derived that the ratio between circumference of a circle and it's radius is (denoted by $\pi$ ): $$\large \pi=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} =  3.1415...$$ Which can be used to evaluate an angle (in units of radians): $$\theta = s/r$$ $s=$ arc length, $r =$ radius.

If $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of dense, open sets of X then $$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty G_n $$  is dense in $X$. Anyway, my question is, Consider $\mathbb{R}$ as the metric space. I can think of the $G_n$'s as perhaps, the rationals and irrationals. These are both dense, and the reals is complete. However their intersection is clearly the empty set, which is nowhere dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Surely this breaks the theorem right away? Or am I just being stupid!

1597051,"Why was Frobenius concerned the groups which today called ""Frobenius Group""?","From their work, it seems that the Ancient mathematicians were investigating a mathematical object not as a fun, but to solve some problem occurred in earlier work of someone. Lagrange, Galois, Abel considered groups for solving equation by radicals. Cauchy proved existence of subgroup of prime order, which was generalized by Sylow (and also by Frobenius in some direction). This development shows that the theorems proved by these mathematicians were related to some natural problem in Mathematics. In such of situation of mathematical research, Frobenius obtained following result in 1901: Let $G$ be a finite transitive permutation group on $X$ such that (1) $Stab(x)\neq 1$ and $Stab(x)\cap Stab(y)=1$ for $x\neq y$. Then the elements of $G$ having no fixed point together with identity form normal subgroup. Question: What was the motivation of Frobenius for considering such class of groups? Certainly he may not had though like let $G$ be a group of permutations on $n$ letters, satisfying ""this, this, this"";  and let's see what happens? In fact, one may see the modern way of choice of a problem; for example this one (just see shaded part first): I want to know the motivation of Frobenius behind it.
