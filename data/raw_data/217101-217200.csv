4421255,What is the Probability of Eating a Certain Meal on a Given Day?,"This is a problem that was given during a discussion section in the first week of my statistics class that I might be overthinking and misunderstanding. You prepare 5 meals for the week, 2 with vegetables and 3 without. Starting on Monday, a meal is consumed each day until Friday. What is the probability that you will eat a meal with vegetables on Wednesday? The answer to this problem was simply: $$\frac{(\text{# of Vegetable Meals})}{(\text{Total # of Meals})}$$ or $\frac{2}{5}$ . My confusion stems from, if a meal is consumed each day wouldn't the number of meals that we can choose from get smaller as we near the end of the week? So by Wednesday there would be only 3 meals to pick from. In addition, why do we not have consider the 3 different cases of the meals eaten before Wednesday? If a vegetable meal is eaten on Monday and Tuesday, then there would be a 0 chance of eating one on Wednesday. What about the cases where there was already 1 vegetable meal eaten before Wednesday? Would that not make the probability of eating a vegetable meal on Wednesday be: $$P(\text{Vegetable Meal on Wednesday)} = \frac{2}{5}*\frac{3}{4}*\frac{1}{3}$$ or if no vegetable meals are eaten before Wednesday at all: $$P(\text{Vegetable Meal on Wednesday})=\frac{3}{5}*\frac{2}{4}*\frac{2}{3}$$ Why would we not sum up these prbabilites to get the actual probability of eating a vegetable meal on Wednesday?","['statistics', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
4421260,Number of ways to color a square graph with diagonal line using principle of Inclusion and Exclusion,"How many ways can we color the graph if adjacent vertices receive different colors ? It's easy to see that the answer is $n(n-1)(n-2)^2 = n^4-5n^3+8n^2-4n$ , where $n$ is the number of colors (fix a color to the top left vertex, for the top right vertex we can choose $n-1$ , for the bottom left we can choose $n-2$ and for the bottom right we can also choose $n-2$ ).

4421528,Can the lion protect the sheep from three wolves?,"Generally, in pursuit-evasion games, there's one prey and one or many pursuers. I'd like to know how extending the food chain would change the dynamics of such games. Specifically, let's consider a closed, circular shape arena in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Three wolves are uniformly distributed at the border. The sheep and his lion friend are at the center. If $d(w(t),s(t))=0$ , the wolf eats the sheep, if $d(l(t),w(t))=0$ , the lion eats the wolf, where w(t), s(t) and l(t) are the trajectories of the animals, and $d$ measures euclidean distance. The pack of wolves work as a group, their goal being to eat the sheep. The goal of the lion-sheep team is to prevent the sheep from being eaten, indefinitely. All animals move continuously in time at equal speed and are intelligent. Can the lion protect the sheep from the wolves? In general, how many lions are necessary to protect the sheep from a pack of $N$ wolves uniformly distributed at the border? This is a puzzle I originally asked here on puzzling.stackexchange. I know already that A single wolf doesn't catch the sheep. Two wolves will catch the sheep. $N-1$ lions are sufficient to fend off $N$ wolves. See here for the proof of those claims. I'm interested in knowing whether $N-2$ or less lions can fend off $N$ wolves.","['geometry', 'calculus', 'optimization', 'game-theory', 'dynamical-systems']"
4421529,Function that makes limit finite,"Question: Let $n > 0$ . How can I find a function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$ such that $$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)^2}{n} \log \left(\frac{f(n)}{n}\right) = L
$$ with $0<L<\infty$ ? Background : The term above appears in my research on subexponential bounds for binary words containing a limited number of ones. I have been able to elimate all other terms, but I am stuck with this one. What I tried so far: I applied L'Hôpital's rule to get $$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log\left(\frac{f(n)}{n}\right)}{\frac{-n}{f(n)^2}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\frac{f'(n)}{f(n)}-\frac{1}{n}}{\frac{1}{f(n)^2}-\frac{2nf'(n)}{f(n)^3}}
$$ which got rid of the $\log()$ . Since the limit should be finite, it seems to me that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} < \infty$ , but I haven't been able to come up with an $f(n)$ that doesn't lead to $L=0$ .","['limits', 'logarithms']"

4421532,Can a free product of groups be co-Hopfian?,"A group $G$ is called co-Hopfian if it is not isomorphic to a proper subgroup of itself; equivalently, every injective group homomorphism $\varphi : G \to G$ is surjective and hence an isomorphism. Examples of co-Hopfian groups include finite groups, $\mathbb{Q}$ , $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ , and fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic manifolds. Examples of groups which are not co-Hopfian include free groups, free abelian groups, $\mathbb{R}$ , and $\mathbb{Q}^*$ (take $\varphi(x) = x^3$ ). In this MathOverflow answer , Ian Agol shows that if a group $C$ is freely indecomposable (i.e. not a non-trivial free product) and co-Hopfian, then $A\ast C \cong B\ast C$ implies $A\cong B$ . As all the examples of co-Hopfian groups I have been able to find are freely indecomposable, I wonder if they all must be, in which case the first condition on $C$ is superfluous. Is a co-Hopfian group necessarily freely indecomposable? Note, answering this question is equivalent to answering the question in the title. I've seen it claimed in a couple of papers that the answer is yes, but references weren't provided which makes me think that this should be fairly elementary. If $G \cong A\ast B$ is co-Hopfian, then there is a proper subgroup $H$ with $H\cong G$ . By the Kurosh subgroup theorem, there is a set $X \subseteq G$ , a family of subgroups $(A_i)_{i\in I}$ of $A$ , a family of subgroups $(B_j)_{j\in J}$ of $B$ , and families of elements $(g_i)_{i\in I}$ , $(f_j)_{j\in J}$ of $G$ such that $H = F(X)\ast\left(\ast_{i\in I}g_iA_ig_i^{-1}\right)\ast\left(\ast_{j\in J}f_jB_jf_j^{-1}\right)$ . I don't know where to go from this point. In particular, I don't know if the fact that $H$ is a proper subgroup yields any information about the cardinalities of $X$ , $I$ , and $J$ .","['co-hopfian', 'group-theory', 'free-product', 'reference-request']"

So $y' = 2\cdot x + 2$ This means that $y = x^2 + 2\cdot x + c$ But I can't find any value of $c$ that would give the original sequence. Now I see that $y'$ could also be $y' = 2\cdot x + 4$ as it gives the correct numbers if we replace starting from $x = 0$ but then we have $y = x^2 + 4\cdot x + c$ and I again can't find any $c$ that matches the original sequence.

Prove that $$\int_0^1xf(x) dx \leq \frac{2}{3}(\int_0^1f(x)dx)^2$$ Work: My professor left us some hints, but I am not sure if I am using them correctly, also I am not sure how to use all of them. Hints are: First hint, substitute $t=\lambda x$ in integral $$F(x)=\int_0^xf(t)dt.$$ What I have got is $$F(x)=\lambda \int_0^xf(\lambda x)dt.$$ Second hint is, using concavity and $f(0)=1$ prove that $$F(x)\geq \frac{x}{2}(1+f(x)).$$ Okay so, for concave functions there is inequality such as this $$f(y)\leq f(x)-f'(x)(y-x).$$ But I haven't got anything from that. Last hint is, using partial integration, conclude that $$\int_0^1 x f(x) dx \leq F(1) - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 x f(x) dx.$$ I think I have proven that, here is what I did: From partial integration I have got $$\int_0^1 x f(x) dx = x F(x){|}_0^1 - \int_0^1 F(x) dx \leq F(1) - \int_0^1 \frac{x}{2} (1+f(x)) dx \leq F(1) - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1xf(x) dx$$ From that we have $$\int_0^1x f(x) dx \leq \frac{2}{3} (F(1) - \frac{1}{4}).$$ Using basic inequality $A^2-A+1/4 \geq 0$ we get $F(1) - \frac{1}{4} \leq F^2(1)$ and proof is finished.
Conclusion: My question is how to prove the second hint and where we use substitution here, is that step necessary? Edit: I have realised that substitution I wrote above was not correct, should be $$\int_0^1 f(\lambda)d\lambda.$$ I guess we use it to make integral be $\int_0^1$ . Still haven't proven second hint.

4421785,Is there a more straightforward way to define the jet bundle?,"Everywhere I have looked, the jet bundle is defined as the fiber bundle of equivalence classes for the partial derivatives of functions from one manifold to another. However, it is easy to see that the 1-jet bundle for real functions on a manifold $M$ is actually just $\Bbb R \times T ^*M$ , and a function $f \in C^\infty(M)$ will have its 1-jet given by $(f(p), \text d f_p)$ . If $f : M \to N$ were instead a smooth function between manifolds, the differential is now a linear operator from $TM \to TN$ , so at every point $p \in M$ , we could identify it with a tensor in $T_p M \otimes T_{f(p)} ^* N$ . Thus, the 1-jet bundle could be given by $N \times (TM \boxtimes TN)$ where $\boxtimes$ is the external tensor product bundle . More specifically, every element in $TM \boxtimes TN$ has the form $$
(p, q, L) \quad (p, q) \in M \times N, L \in T_p M \otimes T_q N,

4421801,Explicitly describe the cryptomorphism between greedoids and greedy set operators,"A greedoid $\mathcal{F}$ on a finite ground set $E$ is cryptomorphic to an operator $\sigma$ (usually - and improperly - called the closure operator of the greedoid) such that: $X \subseteq \sigma(X)$ ; $X\subseteq Y \subseteq \sigma(X) \implies \sigma(X)=\sigma(Y)$ ; suppose that $x \notin X$ and $z \notin \sigma(X \cup \{x\}) \setminus \{z\})$ for all $z \in X \cup x$ . Then $x \in \sigma(X \cup \{y\}) \implies y \in \sigma(X \cup \{x\})$ . My intention is to explicit describe the cryptomorphism by means of a bijection between the set system of the feasible sets of the greedoid and the ""closure"" operator. To this end, as $X$ is feasible if and only if $x \notin \sigma(X \setminus \{x\})$ for each $x \in X$ (here $\sigma$ denotes the closure operator of the greedoid), I expect that $\mathcal{F}_\sigma:=\{X: \, x \notin \sigma(X \setminus \{x\}) \,\, \forall x \in X \}$ whenever $\sigma$ is a set operator satisfying the properties 1-3 listed above. Now, I want to construct its inverse, namely a map which associates with the feasible sets of a matroid a set operator satisfying the properties 1-3 listed above.

In my reading, I've seen this used by The Wikipedia article on Stratonovich integrals (link) Apparently this is used in Ioannis Karatzas & Steven Shreve's Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus (Amazon link) The Encyclopedia of Math website (link) An article by Jonathan Mattingly on The Probability Workbook (link) The Second Definition: Definition $(2)$ seems to be inspired simply by the Riemann-Stieltjes formulation for deterministic functions: $$\int_0^t f(x) \, \mathrm{d} \varphi(x) = \lim_{\|P\| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n f(\xi_i) \Delta \varphi_i \tag{2'}$$ (for $\Delta \varphi_i$ defined similarly as for $\Delta B_i$ ). In this case, $\xi_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$ . This second definition of the Stratonovich integral seems to be inspired similarly: take $\xi_i$ to be the midpoints, $\varphi$ your Brownian motion, and $f$ comes from your stochastic process. In my reading, I've seen this definition used by: Bernt Øksendal in Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications (Amazon link) Dr. Peyam on YouTube (video link) Apparently, this arises in Steven Shreve's Stochastic Calculus for Finance (Amazon link) Lewis Smith on this webpage My Question: It does not seem obvious to me that these would be equivalent definitions. Moreover, I've several times seen on Math Stack Exchange (e.g. here ) the claim that $(1)$ is the ""correct"" definition, though seeing it used elsewhere (e.g. this Math Overflow post) no one objects (openly) to $(2)$ . Hence, I'm seeking a proper, definitive answer, because I am very confused: Which is ""correct"" to call the Stratonovich integral? Is it simply a matter of preference? Is there a particular reason to prefer one over the other if there is no definitive answer? Do any results for one definition break under the other? (Such as: does the conversion to an Itô integral break? What about properties like the chain rule?) ...or am I just totally missing something here?","['stochastic-integrals', 'probability', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'stochastic-calculus']"

4421970,"Can a norm on polynomials be ""almost multiplicative"", even for large degrees?","Definition: A norm on a real algebra is called almost multiplicative if there are positive constants $L$ and $U$ such that, for all $f$ and $g$ in the algebra, $$L\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert\;\leq\;\lVert f\cdot g\rVert\;\leq\;U\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert;$$ equivalently, if $$0\;<\;\inf_{f,g}\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}\;\leq\;\sup_{f,g}\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}\;<\;\infty.$$ Is there an almost multiplicative norm on $\mathbb R[x]$ ? The infimum (or supremum) is the same, whether the polynomials $f$ and $g$ have integer coefficients, or rational coefficients (just factor out a common denominator), or real coefficients (take limits of rationals). I don't know if it's the same for complex coefficients (given that the norm respects the complex absolute value: $\lVert e^{i\theta}f\rVert=\lVert f\rVert$ ). Denote by $\mathbb R[x]_n$ the space of polynomials of degree $n$ or less. This has finite dimension $n+1$ . If we consider multiplication $\mathbb R[x]_m\times\mathbb R[x]_n\to\mathbb R[x]_{m+n}$ , and take the infimum/supremum over these subspaces, then any norm is almost multiplicative. That is because the unit sphere in finite dimensions is compact; the infimum is actually a minimum, and the supremum is actually a maximum. The minimizing polynomials are non-zero, so their product is non-zero: $\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}>0$ . The maximizing polynomials have a defined product, which has finite norm: $\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}<\infty$ . Of course that argument doesn't work for the whole infinite-dimensional space $\mathbb R[x]$ . No norm on polynomials is actually multiplicative; the infimum is not equal to the supremum. Multiplicative norm on $\mathbb{R}[X]$. These bounds on norms of products are useful for factoring polynomials with integer coefficients. Suppose $f\cdot g\in\mathbb Z[x]_n\backslash\{0\}$ is known but $f$ and $g$ are not known. Let $L$ be a lower bound for products as described above. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be the minimum norm on $\mathbb Z[x]_n\backslash\{0\}$ ; this exists because $\mathbb Z[x]_n$ is a lattice in $\mathbb R[x]_n$ , and a lattice intersected with a ball is a finite set. Then there are only finitely many possible factors $f$ , because $$\lVert f\rVert\;\leq\;\frac{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}{\varepsilon}\;\leq\;\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\varepsilon L}.$$ Relevant links: Bombieri Norm Bounds on Factors in $\mathbb Z[x]$ (Abbott) Global optimization: a model problem , or A Model Problem for Global optimization (Rump) I considered weighted $\infty$ -norms; norms of the form $$\Bigg\lVert\sum_ka_kx^k\Bigg\rVert_c=\max_k(c_k|a_k|)$$ where $c=(c_0,c_1,c_2,\cdots)$ is a sequence of positive numbers. The upper bound $\lVert f\cdot g\rVert\leq U\lVert f\rVert\lVert g\rVert$ then is saying that $$\max_l\left|c_l\sum_{j+k=l}a_jb_k\right|\leq U\max_j|c_ja_j|\max_k|c_kb_k|.$$ By scaling the coefficients, $a_j'=c_ja_j$ and $b_k'=c_kb_k$ , this is equivalent to $$\max_l\left|\sum_{j+k=l}\frac{c_l}{c_jc_k}a_j'b_k'\right|\leq U\max_j|a_j'|\max_k|b_k'|.$$ By applying the triangle inequality (for one direction, and by taking particular examples with $a_j',b_k'\in\{0,1\}$ for the other direction), this is equivalent to $$\sum_{j+k=l}\frac{c_l}{c_jc_k}\leq U$$ for every $l\in\mathbb N$ . For the constant weight $c_k=1$ , the $l$ 'th sum here is just $\sum_{j+k=l}(1)=l+1$ which is unbounded. For the factorial weights $c_k=k!$ , the $l$ 'th sum is $$\sum_{j+k=l}\frac{l!}{j!k!}=\sum_k\binom{l}{k}=2^l$$ which is also unbounded. For the inverse factorial weights $c_k=1/k!$ , the $l$ 'th sum is $\sum_k1/\binom lk$ , which has maximum $8/3$ (at $l=3$ or $4$ ) and limit $2$ (as $l\to\infty$ ). So we can take $U=8/3$ as an upper bound. But I think there is no lower bound $L>0$ , considering for example $f_n(x)=(x+1)^n$ and $g_n(x)=(x-1)^n$ (though I'm not sure the norm ratio actually converges to $0$ as $n\to\infty$ ). For the square weights $c_k=(k+1)^2$ , the $l$ 'th sum is $\sum_k\left(\frac{(l+1)}{(l-k+1)(k+1)}\right)^2$ , which seems to have maximum $3.5171$ (at $l=19$ ), and has limit $\pi^2/3$ . So there is an upper bound. It is harder to find lower bounds. I don't know if there's any norm on $\mathbb R[x]$ for which $\frac{\lVert f\cdot g\rVert}{\lVert f\rVert\cdot\lVert g\rVert}\geq L>0$ . Even if there are norms with lower bounds as well as norms with upper bounds, there isn't necessarily a single norm which is bounded both ways.","['normed-spaces', 'polynomials', 'functional-analysis', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'supremum-and-infimum']"

So I started to try some simple cases using compound angle formula by integration by parts. $$
\begin{aligned}
I_1=\int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r\sin \theta+\theta) d \theta =& \int e^{r \cos \theta}[\cos (r\sin \theta) \cos \theta-\sin (r \sin \theta) \sin \theta] d \theta \\
=& \int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r\sin \theta) \cos \theta d \theta-  \int e^{r\cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta) \sin \theta d \theta
\end{aligned}
$$ Fortunately, \begin{aligned}  \int e^{r\cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta) \sin \theta d \theta &\stackrel{IBP}{=}  
-\frac{1}{r} \int \sin (r \sin \theta) d\left(e^{r \cos \theta}\right)\\&=-\frac{e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r\sin \theta)}{r}+\int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r\sin \theta)\cos \theta d\theta\\
\therefore \int e^{r\cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta) \sin \theta d \theta&=\frac{e^{r\cos \theta} \sin (r\sin \theta)}{r}+C_1
\end{aligned} Applying the same technique decreases $n$ to $n-1$ yields \begin{aligned}
I_{n} &=\int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r \sin \theta+n \theta) d \theta\\
&=\int e^{r \cos \theta}[\cos (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta) \cos \theta-\sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta)\sin \theta] d \theta\\

\end{aligned} Applying integration by parts to the last integral yields \begin{aligned}&\int e^{r\cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta) \sin \theta d \theta\\=& -\frac{1}{r} \int \sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta) d\left(e^{r \cos \theta}\right)\\=&-\frac{1}{r}\left[e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta)\right] +\frac{1}{r} \int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r\sin \theta+(n-1) \theta)(r\cos \theta+(n-1)) d \theta \\=&-\frac{1}{r}\left[e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta)\right] + \int e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta) \cos \theta d \theta+\frac{n-1}{r} I_{n-1}\end{aligned} Putting it back yields the reduction formula $$\boxed{I_n = \frac{1}{r}\left[e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta+(n-1) \theta)-(n-1)I_{n-1}\right]}$$ Now let’s use the reduction formula and Mathematical Induction to prove that $$J_n:=\int_0^{2\pi} e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r \sin \theta+n \theta) d \theta=0$$ First of all, $$J_1=\left[I_1\right]_0^{2\pi}= \left[ \frac{e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r \sin \theta)}{r}\right] _0^{2\pi}=0$$ Now assume it is true for some $k$ i.e. $J_k=0$ , then $$
J_{k+1}=\frac{1}{r}\left(\left[e^{r \cos \theta} \sin (r\sin \theta+k \theta)\right]_{0}^{2 \pi}-k J _k\right)=0
$$ Therefore it is also true for $n=k+1$ and hence by the principle of Mathematical Induction, we have $$
\boxed{\int_{0}^{2 \pi} e^{r \cos \theta} \cos (r \sin \theta+n \theta) d \theta
=0}$$ For reference, $$

4422128,Can we be certain that the only nonzero differentiable function satisfying $g(x+y)=\frac{g(x)+g(y)}{1+g(x)g(y)}$ and $|g|\lt 1$ is $\tanh(kx)$?,"The following question is a question aimed for the Further Maths UK syllabus (it is a Step $2$ question)- i.e. not very formal, so I am certain my solution to the question is correct as the question intended it, but I am uncertain whether it is formally the only, or the right, solution. I am especially uncertain about my application of the Picard existence & uniqueness theorem. The problem: The function $g$ has derivative $g'$ and satisfies: $$g(x+y)=\frac{g(x)+g(y)}{1+g(x)g(y)}$$ For all $x$ and $y$ , $|g(x)|\lt 1$ for all $x$ , and $g'(0)=k\neq0$ . Find $g'(x)$ in terms of $g(x)$ and $k$ , and hence find $g(x)$ in terms of $x$ and $k$ . My solution (but is it unique, and is it rigorously done?): Consider the difference quotient for $y\neq 0$ , some $x\in\Bbb R$ : $$\tag{1}\frac{g(x+y)-g(x)}{y}=(1-g^2(x))\cdot\frac{g(y)}{y(1+g(x)g(y))}$$ First note that $|g(x)|\lt1$ gives $(1-g^2(x))\neq0$ and $1+g(x)g(y)\neq0$ . Secondly, if $g'(0)\neq0$ we must have that the numerator of the difference quotient must be nonzero in some small deleted neighbourhood of $0$ (else we could take a convergent sequence $y_n\to0$ where $g(y_n)=0$ for all $n$ , and then $g'(0)=0$ if the limit exists) so if we set $x=0$ , we may divide by $g(y)$ in the above with $y$ close to $0$ but $g(y)\neq0$ : $$\frac{g(y)-g(0)}{y}=(1-g^2(0))\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{y}{g(y)}+y\cdot g(0)}$$ For the above limit as $y\to0$ to exist, the limit as $y\to0$ of the denominator must exist: as $\lim_{y\to0}y\cdot g(0)$ exists (and equals $0$ ) we conclude $\lim_{y\to0}\frac{y}{g(y)}$ must exist, giving: $$\begin{align}k=\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(y)-g(0)}{y}&=(1-g^2(0))\cdot\frac{1}{\lim_{y\to0}\frac{y}{g(y)}}\\\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(y)}{y}&=\frac{k}{(1-g^2(0))}\end{align}$$ This further implies that $g(y)\to0$ as $y\to0$ and by continuity of differentiable functions $g(0)=0$ , so that: $$k=\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(y)}{y}=\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(y)-g(0)}{y}$$ Using the same argument that $g(y)\neq 0$ in some small deleted neighbourhood of $0$ and dividing by $g(y)$ in $(1)$ , for now arbitrary $x$ , we get: $$g'(x)=\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(x+y)-g(x)}{y}=(1-g^2(x))\cdot\lim_{y\to0}\frac{g(y)}{y}=(1-g^2(x))\cdot k$$ The differential equation $g'(x)=k(1-g^2(x))$ has a solution in $g(x)=\tanh(kx)$ . I think that by the Picard existence theorem, the solution is unique since $|g(x)|\lt 1$ gives a Lipschitz bound on $k(1-g^2(x))$ , although even then we only have uniqueness potentially in some small interval around $0$ . Can we really conclude $g(x)=\tanh(kx)$ with certainty?

Then $\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(\frac{n}{j})$ should count the same but with more detail. For $j = 1$ we have $f(n)$ which counts all the ordered pairs but with the restriction that they have to be coprime. We can partition the set of all ordered pairs into those that are coprime and those that are not. Then that would mean that if we prove that $\sum_{j=2}^{n} f(\frac{n}{j})$ counts all the ordered pairs that are not coprime then the problem would be solved. That's all I have figured out for now.

4422588,Why does compound interest exist?,"Background My understanding is that compound interest arises in the following way: The bank offers its clients some interest rate $r$ on an account with principal $P$ that yields $rP$ after some time $t_0$ . But clients, not wanting to wait for $t_0$ to pass before seeing any returns, ask if they can instead have some fraction of the full return every time interval $t_0 / n$ , where $n$ is some natural number. Reasonably, the bank agrees to pay out $r/n$ times the current balance every $t_0 / n$ . The amount of money $A(t)$ in an account with principal $P$ after time $t$ is then the usual compound interest formula \begin{equation}
A(t) = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{\frac{nt}{t_0}} \label{comp-int}\tag{1}
\end{equation} The Problem? While the deal that the bank offers may seem reasonable for the bank, it results in the interest earned after time $t_0$ exceeding the original offer. Orignally, after $t_0$ , the client would have a total balance of $(1 + r)P$ . With compound interest, after $t_0$ , the client would have a total balance of $A(t_0) = P(1 + r/n)^n$ . The bank overpays (compared to its original promise) by a ratio of $$
\frac{\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n}{1 + r}
$$ which is bounded by $$
1 \leq \frac{\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n}{1 + r} \leq \frac{e^r}{1 + r} \label{bound}\tag{2}
$$ The problem, it seems to me, is that the offer is all downside for the bank. They give their clients money more often and end up giving them more money than the original offer. Why would a bank ever offer this option? An Alternative? If there were no other reasonable way to compute a partial return on an investment, then of course client demand would eventually force banks to make the compound interest offer. But there is a readily available and (to me) perfectly reasonable alternative. Why not just compute the current balance as $$
A(t) = P(1 + r)^\frac{t}{t_0} \label{alt}\tag{3}
$$ This has a few advantages. It doesn't require a new parameter $n$ . It can be calculated continuously, but unlike the typical limit as $n$ goes to infinity (i.e. $Pe^{rt/t_0}$ ) it doesn't result in the bank overpaying. That is, $A(t_0) = P(1 + r)$ , which was the original offer. Speculation I would speculate that the reason interest isn't calculated as in \ref{alt} is because it doesn't make sense to the mathematical layman. To the layman, the fair amount to be paid after time $t_0/n$ is $r/n$ times the current balance so that the new balance is $1 + r/n$ times the old balance — you just divide both by $n$ . But the mathematically correct (I claim) way to evenly divide the payments would be to multiply the current balance by $(1 + r)^\frac{1}{n}$ every $t_0/n$ , which seems more complicated and results in an effective interest rate less than $r/n$ per $t_0/n$ . I can imagine that would be a tough sell to someone who doesn't understand the math. Instead the bank opts for the more approachable $1 + r/n$ factor, with the understanding that the deviation from the original offer is bounded (as \ref{bound} shows) and so an acceptable loss if clients are more likely to accept the offer. Aside: musicians (or at least piano tuners) have to understand this math. The correct ratio between half-steps for equal temperament is $2^{1/12}$ , not $1 + \frac{1}{12}$ . While the latter would be somewhat close to the correct tuning, it would lead to an octave that is about $31\%$ sharp. TL;DR Why is compound interest calculated with \ref{comp-int} and not the simpler and (I argue) more mathematically correct \ref{alt}?","['algebra-precalculus', 'math-history', 'soft-question', 'finance']"

4422654,"Connections between the different characterizations of ideals? (Dedekind's ideal numbers, quotientable subsets, kernels)","Two answers here present two very different approaches to motivating ideals. The first presents the historical motivation for ideals, namely Kummer's idea that in some rings like $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ there are somehow ""ideal numbers"" that allow us to factor products like $2 \cdot 3 = 6 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$ further, and more importantly, uniquely. The second presents the completely abstract construction of an ideal $I$ of ring $R$ to be exactly a subset that $a \sim b \iff a-b\in I$ is an equivalence relation s.t. $R/{\sim}$ inherits the ring structure of $R$ ; or as that answer put it, ""Equations in $R$ give corresponding equations between equivalence classes in $R/{\sim}$ "". An answer here phrased this quotient idea as ""You can think of ideals as subsets that behave similarly to zero"". Again in Intuition behind ""ideal"" , Qiaochu Yuan says ""To me ideals are kernels of ring homomorphisms"". This point of view is very connected to the quotient point of view presented above, essentially by the 1st isomorphism theorem . It also makes rigorous the above idea that ""ideals are subsets that behave similarly to zero"", since kernels are literally the set of elements that get mapped to $0$ by a ring homomorphism. My question is how to connect this latter, more ""abstract"" point of view with the historical/Kummer-Dedekind point of view? I don't really have a good intuition/picture for why the set of all elements ""divisible by some (ideal) number"" should be exactly a subset of elements $S$ s.t. we can ""do exactly the same kind of arithmetic"" with cosets $\{r+S\}_{r\in R}$ as we can with elements $\{r\}_{r\in R}$ .","['algebraic-number-theory', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'intuition', 'ideals']"

Borrowing inspiration from some other questions, I am hoping to cook up a periodic function $f(x)$ so that I can exploit its Fourier series to evaluate $S$ . Or possibly the sums that make up $S$ . For instance, I've started the hunt with the cosine expansion of $f(x)=\cos\left(\frac x8\right)$ on $[-\pi,\pi]$ , given by $$\cos\left(\frac x8\right) = \frac8\pi \sin\left(\frac\pi8\right) - \frac8\pi \sin\left(\frac\pi8\right) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^n}{8n-1} - \frac{(-1)^n}{8n+1}\right) \cos(nx)$$ as well as $\cos\left(\frac{3x}8\right)$ , which has an expansion containing denominators with $8n\pm3$ . I don't know whether having $8n-1$ and $8n-3$ will be a problem, since there is some correspondence between $8n-1$ and $8n+7$ , as well as $8n-3$ and $8n+5$ . For posterity, I also considered the sine expansion of $f$ as well as the co/sine expansions of $\sin\left(\frac x8\right)$ . $$\begin{align*}
\cos\left(\frac x8\right) &= \frac8\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1-(-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{8n-1} + \frac{1-(-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{8n+1}\right) \sin(nx) \\[1ex]
\sin\left(\frac x8\right) &= \frac{16}\pi \sin^2\left(\frac\pi{16}\right) - \frac8\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1-(-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{8n-1} - \frac{1 - (-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{8n+1}\right) \cos(nx)\\[1ex]
\sin\left(\frac x8\right)&= -\frac8\pi \sin\left(\frac\pi8\right) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^n}{8n-1} + \frac{(-1)^n}{8n+1}\right) \sin(nx)
\end{align*}$$ Next I looked at $x \cos\left(\frac x8\right)$ in an attempt to get the squared denominators, with e.g. cosine expansion $$\begin{align*}
x\cos\left(\frac x8\right) &= \frac8\pi \left(8\cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)+\pi\sin\left(\frac\pi8\right)-8\right) \\ & \qquad - 8\sin\left(\frac\pi8\right) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^n}{8n-1} - \frac{(-1)^n}{8n+1}\right) \cos(nx) \\ & \qquad - \frac{64}\pi \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\frac{1 - (-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{(8n-1)^2} + \frac{1 - (-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{(8n+1)^2}\right) \cos(nx) \\[1ex]
(x-\pi) \cos\left(\frac x8\right) &= \frac{64}\pi \left(\cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)-1\right) - \frac{64}\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1 - (-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{(8n-1)^2} + \frac{1 - (-1)^n \cos\left(\frac\pi8\right)}{(8n+1)^2}\right) \cos(nx)
\end{align*}$$ The next move would be to pick a value of $x$ to recover some numerical series, but the right choice - if there is one - isn't obvious to me. I can nearly recover two that I want, namely $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac1{(8n+1)^2} + \frac1{(8n+7)^2}\right)$$ but still have to deal with their alternating variants. Presumably I can do something similar with $\cos\left(\frac{3x}8\right)$ , but one thing at a time.

For the six aspherical geometries the models $ X $ are all homeomorphic, so it is possible for one manifold to admit multiple geometries.

4423055,Probability of crossing between a line on a circle and a line segment inside the circle,"Say that we have a circle centered in $(0,0)$ with a radius $R$ . Inside the circle, we have a vertical line segment of length $2d$ in the center of the circle ( $x_1=-d,x_2=d,y_1=y_2=0$ ). Now let's take two points on the circumference of the circle with angle $\theta_1,\theta_2$ and draw a line between them. You can see it better by the figure below. My question will be what is the probability of having these two lines (the one at the origin and the random one). My first idea is to take $\theta_1,\theta_2$ from a uniform distribution and so I'll just need to find the condition for the crossing and I can then just integrate $\int\int d\theta_1 d\theta_2$ and this will be some function of $d/R$ . Starting from this I could write that for this crossing to happen we should have $-d<y(0)<d$ where $y(x)$ is the line equation for the random line. I can then rewrite this condition as: $|\cos(\theta_1) \cot(\frac{\theta_1 + \theta_2}{2}) + \sin(\theta_1) |\leq \frac{d}{R}$ . Numerically, I can find this probability (I did two things, first I would take a large amount of random line about 10 million and see how many cross on average and change $d/R$ and see how it changes and the other was just to check with the condition above for all values of $\theta_1,\theta_2 \in [0,2\pi]$ and also average and both methods gives the same results). But I'm trying to find an analytical expression and I'm stuck here. My idea is to first fix $\theta_1$ then find a condition for $\theta_2$ and then integrate $\theta_2$ and afterwards integrate $\theta_1$ between $0,2\pi$ and this should in principle give me the probability, but I can't seem to find a way to express the integration condition for $\theta_2$ , I tried doing it with Mathematica as well but it's not working out. Any help will be appreciated. Also, if needed, here's the results that I got from numerics for the probability.","['circles', 'geometry', 'probability']"

4423237,Why is the bizarre $f^{-1}(y)=y+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dy^{n-1}}[y-f(y)]^n$ equivalent to the Lagrange inversion formula?,"$\newcommand{\d}{\mathrm{d}}$ EDIT: In the nontrivial example $f(x)=x-\frac{1}{4}x^3$ and using either of the two series to produce a result for $f^{-1}(3/4)$ , I find that $(\ast)$ and $(1)$ produce the same result. It would appear that they actually are, by some unseen machinery, equivalent. Why? Op: A collection of past ""Step"" exam questions includes a question based on the following assertion: If $y=f(x)$ , the inverse of $f$ is given by Lagrange's identity : $$\tag{$\ast$}f^{-1}(y)=y+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}\frac{\d^{n-1}}{\d y^{n-1}}[y-f(y)]^n$$ Of course this is not very formally phrased, since the targeted syllabus is pre-university, but let's infer that $f$ is to be a real analytic injection and $y$ in its image (that being said, it still feels as if far too many $y$ s are floating around - is $y$ fixed? Where did $x$ go?) With that, I am still suspicious of this identity. The Lagrange Inversion Theorem as I know it has two forms: Suppose $f:\Bbb C\to\Bbb C$ is analytic at a point $a$ and $f'(a)\neq0$ ; then there is a neighbourhood $V\subseteq\Bbb C$ of $f(a)$ in which the function $g:V\to\Bbb C$ defined by: $$\tag{1}z\mapsto a+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}(z-f(a))^n\cdot\lim_{w\to a}\frac{\d^{n-1}}{\d w^{n-1}}\left[\left(\frac{w-a}{f(w)-f(a)}\right)^n\right]$$ Is a local analytic inverse of $f$ - $f(z)=w\iff z=g(w)$ if $w\in V,z\in f^{-1}(V)$ . There is also a cute combinatorial version, Lagrange-Burmann: Suppose $f:\Bbb C\to\Bbb C$ satisfies $f(w)=w/\phi(w)$ for some analytic $\phi:\Bbb C\to\Bbb C$ with $\phi(0)\neq 0$ . There is a similarly defined as above inverse to $f$ , $g$ , with coefficient formula: $$\tag{2}[w^n]g(w)=\frac{1}{n}[z^{n-1}]\phi(w)^n$$ Let's note that $(\ast)$ is broadly similar but technically different to both $(1)$ and $(2)$ . My question is: I know for a fact $(1),(2)$ are equivalent and correct after many hours of painful research, but $(\ast)$ I have never seen before - how is it equivalent to $(1)$ ? We note that if they are equivalent, this would imply (I think, anyway - the excessive usage of $y$ s is baffling): $$(y-f(x))^n\cdot\lim_{a\to x}\frac{\d^{n-1}}{\d a^{n-1}}\left[\left(\frac{a-x}{f(a)-f(x)}\right)^n\right]\equiv\frac{\d^{n-1}}{\d y^{n-1}}[y-f(y)]^n$$ But this seems ridiculous, especially since no fixed point $x$ is defined, on the right hand side. Moreover a direct equation of coefficients reveals that the centrepoint $x$ should be taken as $y$ , which again seems nonsensical. Is the examiner abusing notation, am I making some mistake, or is $(\ast)$ nonsense as my gut feeling suggests? I surely hope it is not the latter.","['inverse-function', 'complex-analysis', 'calculus', 'lagrange-inversion', 'power-series']"

\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}E[x\mid x\le\tau]=\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\tau}\frac{xf(x)}{F(\tau)}dx\right)=\frac{f(\tau)}{F(\tau)}(\tau-E[x\mid x\le\tau]).

Analogous to Chebyshev's race between primes, I examined the race between primes in the greatest prime factors, GPF , of natural numbers.

However, unlike the regular prime race where the race is equal ( A038691 ) or changes lead between primes of the form $4k+1$ and $4k+3$ ( A096628 ) in the GPF race, $4k+3$ dominates.

Therefore, I was trying to solve this problem by transforming side lengths into cotangents. Because $$\cot A=\frac{\cos A}{\sin A}=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\cdot \frac{bc}{2F}=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{4F}\,, \quad \text{(by the law of sines and the law of cosines)}$$ the inequality we desire is equivalent to $$\left(\cot B+\cot C\right)\left(\cot B'+\cot C'\right)+\left(\cot C+\cot A\right)\left(\cot C'+\cot A'\right)+\left(\cot A+\cot B\right)\left(\cot A'+\cot B'\right)\geqslant 4.$$ Expanding it and arrange terms gives us $$2\left(\cot A\cot A'+\cot B\cot B' +\cot C\cot C'\right) + M\geqslant 4$$ where $M=\cot A \left(\cot B'+\cot C'\right)+\cot B \left(\cot A'+\cot C'\right)+\cot C \left(\cot A'+\cot B'\right)$ . We know $M\geqslant 2$ , so I thought if I can prove $\cot A\cot A'+\cot B\cot B' +\cot C\cot C \geqslant 1$ , the problem would be solved. However, this might not be true. After this,  I got stuck. Another inequality related to this problem is $$a^2x+b^2y+c^2z\geqslant 4F\sqrt{xy+yz+zx}\quad \forall x,y,z\in \mathbb{R}^+.\quad\text{(Oppenheim's inequality)} $$ If we set $x=a'^2, y=b'^2, z=c'^2$ , we can get $$a^2a'^2+b^2b'^2+c^2c'^2\geqslant 4F\sqrt{\frac{(2F')^2}{\sin A'}+\frac{(2F')^2}{\sin B'}+\frac{(2F')^2}{\sin C'}}=8FF'\sqrt{\csc^2 A'+\csc^2 B' +\csc^2 C'}.$$ And by Jensen's inequality, we can get $$a^2a'^2+b^2b'^2+c^2c'^2\geqslant 8FF' \cdot \sqrt{3\csc^2\left(\frac{A'+B'+C'}{3}\right)}=16FF'. \square $$ Notice that when $a'=b'=c'$ our inequality is essentially Weitzenböck's inequality, so when both triangles our equilateral triangles, we get an equality. I guess this inequality can also be directly derived from Pedoe's inequality (maybe without trig), but I don't know how to prove this only by Pedoe's. I'm also willing to see other perspectives (maybe pure geometry?...) to this problem.

4424040,Doubts about Proof of Durrett Theorem 3.7.4. Thinning of Poisson Process,"I am having trouble understanding Durrett's logic in his proof of the thinning of the Poisson process. Here is the statement of the Theorem: $N_j(t)$ are independent rate $\lambda P(Y_i = j)$ Poisson processes. $N(t)$ is assumed to be a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ (e.g., the number of cars arrive at a store at time t), and $N_i(t)$ is defined as the number of $i \leq N(t)$ with $Y_i = j$ , where $Y_i$ is an additionally defined property associated with the arrivals (e.g., the number of passengers in the arrived cars). In Durrett's proof, he first proved a simple case where this additional property $Y_i$ is binary. He defined $P(Y_i = 1) = p$ and $P(Y_i = 2) = 1 - p$ , which is fine. What I am having problems with are: (1) He asserted that $N_1(t)$ and $N_2(t)$ are Poisson processes without proving it. This is what I do not understand - isn't it part of the statement to be proved that $N_1(t)$ and $N_2(t)$ are Poisson processes? Why is this true? (2) He proved that if $X_i = N_i(t + s) - N_i(s)$ , $X_1 = j$ and $X_2 = k$ , there must be $j + k$ arrivals between $s$ and $s + t$ , so $P(X_1 = j, X_2 = k) = e^{\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^{j+k}}{(j+k)!}\frac{(j+k)!}{j!k!}p^j (1-p)^k = e^{\lambda pt} \frac{(\lambda p t)^j}{j!}e^{\lambda(1-p)}t \frac{(\lambda (1-p) t)^j}{j!}$ . Then he asserted that $X_1 = Poisson(\lambda pt)$ and $X_2 = Poisson(\lambda (1-p)t)$ . My question is, why can you assert that because $P(X_1 = j, X_2 = k)$ factors into two Poisson distributions, so $X_1$ and $X_1$ are independent, $X_1$ must be $Poisson(\lambda pt)$ and $X_2$ must be $Poisson(\lambda (1-p)t)$ ?

4424280,"Where does this ""proof"" that $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ is normal in the box topology go awry?","James Munkres' Topology, 2nd Edition indicates that the space $$\Bbb{R}^\omega := \{ (x_0, x_1, x_2, ...) | x_i \in \Bbb{R}, \forall i < \omega \}$$ equipped with the box topology is completely regular, but that normality is not known. He points to a result of Mary Ellen Rudin that the box product of countably many $\sigma$ -compact, locally compact metric spaces is, assuming CH , not just normal but paracompact. I thought I had a clean-looking ""proof"" that $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ in the box topology was normal, along the following lines: Let's say we have disjoint closed sets 𝘾, 𝘿 ⊂ $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ in the box topology. If 𝘼 := $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ \ 𝘿, then 𝘼 is open, contains 𝘾, and is disjoint from 𝘿. Similarly, 𝘽 := $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ \ 𝘾 is open and disjoint from 𝘾, and it contains 𝘿. For all 𝐱 ∈ 𝘾, let 𝐱 ∈ 𝘼(𝐱) ⊆ 𝘼 be an open box so that $$𝘼(𝐱) - 𝐱 = \prod_i (-𝑎ᵢ(𝐱), 𝑎ᵢ(𝐱))$$ with $0 < 𝑎ᵢ( 𝐱) < 1$ for all 𝑖 ∈ ℕ. Similarly, for all 𝐲 ∈ 𝘿, let 𝐲 ∈ 𝘽(𝐲) ⊆ 𝘽 be an open box so that $$𝘽(𝐲) - 𝐲 = \prod_i (-𝑏ᵢ(𝐲), 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲))$$ with $0 < 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲) < 1$ for all 𝑖 ∈ ℕ. By construction, 𝘼(𝐱) is disjoint from 𝘿 and 𝘽(𝐲) is disjoint from 𝘾 for all 𝐱 ∈ 𝘾, 𝐲 ∈ 𝘿. If additionally every 𝘼(𝐱) was disjoint from every 𝘽(𝐲) for all 𝐱 ∈ 𝘾, 𝐲 ∈ 𝘿, then we could take $$𝙐 := \bigcup_{𝐱 ∈ 𝘾} 𝘼(𝐱),$$ $$𝙑 := \bigcup_{𝐲 ∈ 𝘿} 𝘽(𝐲),$$ as our disjoint open sets containing 𝘾 and 𝘿, respectively. If for some pair 𝐱, 𝐲, 𝘼(𝐱) ⋂ 𝘽(𝐲) is nonempty, then since 𝐱 ∉ 𝘽(𝐲) and 𝐲 ∉ 𝘼(𝐱), there must be some index 𝑖 for which $$|𝑥ᵢ - 𝑦ᵢ| > \max(𝑎ᵢ(𝐱), 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲)),$$ but where $$(𝑥ᵢ - 𝑎ᵢ(𝐱), 𝑥ᵢ + 𝑎ᵢ(𝐱)) ⋂ (𝑦ᵢ - 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲), 𝑦ᵢ + 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲)) ≠ ∅.$$ But if we replaced 𝑎ᵢ(𝐱) by 𝑎ᵢ(𝐱)/3 and 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲) by 𝑏ᵢ(𝐲)/3, then it would no longer be possible for these to intersect, since $$\frac{a_i(𝐱)}{3} + \frac{b_i(𝐲)}{3} < \frac{2|x_i - y_i|}{3} < |x_i - y_i|.$$ So if we, as a precautionary measure: replace the open box 𝘼(𝐱) by the 1/3-scaled open box 𝘼'(𝐱) := 𝐱 + (𝘼(𝐱) - 𝐱)/3 for every 𝐱 ∈ 𝘾, and replace the open box 𝘽(𝐲) by the 1/3-scaled open box 𝘽'(𝐲) := 𝐲 + (𝘽(𝐲) - 𝐲)/3 for every 𝐲 ∈ 𝘿, then every 𝘼'(𝐱) is guaranteed to be disjoint from every 𝘽'(𝐲) for all 𝐱 ∈ 𝘾, 𝐲 ∈ 𝘿, so that we can define $$𝙐' := \bigcup_{𝐱 ∈ 𝘾} 𝘼'(𝐱),$$ $$𝙑' := \bigcup_{𝐲 ∈ 𝘿} 𝘽'(𝐲),$$ as our desired disjoint open sets containing 𝘾 and 𝘿. $\blacksquare$ I had just about persuaded myself that this argument worked, but then I saw another post explaining that a countable box product of metric spaces need not be normal, with reference to this paper by Erik van Douwen . So now I'm thinking that my argument ""proves too much"", since this line of reasoning could presumably generalize to show that any countable box product of metric spaces ought to be normal.

My question is whether the convergence of the Arnoldi method with this starting new vector is guaranteed by some theorem, or in general is just a good choice according to literature, or there are some sort of bound on the residual norm of the method, i.e $\|AV_ky -V_kH_ky\|$ and why it should converge to zero (where $y$ is the primitive Ritz vector).

So, I added another function to the code to ""calculate"" exactly that number by doing all possible paths from the opposite corner to the start where every step involves a decrease in the minimum number of moves needed to get to that square (which is calculated beforehand with the other function I mentioned at the beginning). By now I have values for all $n$ from $1$ to $34$ (attached the list below).

4424650,Algebraicity of compact Riemann surfaces,"I am taking a course in Riemann surfaces, in which the classical result about algebraicity of compact riemann Surfaces has been proven. However, I think there are some dubious points in the proof. Here is the outline: let X be our compact connected Riemann surface, let g be its genus. If D is a divisor whose degree d satisfies $d\geq2g+1$ , then the associated map $\varphi_{|D|}:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^N(\mathbb{C})$ , with $N=d-g$ , is a holomorphic embedding, so $Y=\varphi_{|D|}(X)$ is a closed submanifold of dimension $1$ in $\mathbb{P}^N$ . Now consider the graded $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra $R(D):=\bigoplus_{n\geq0} H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$ , with multiplication given by the product of global sections. Using what has been presented as the Castelnuovo-Mumford theorem, under these conditions there exists, for every $n\geq0$ , a natural surjection $$
H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D))^{\otimes n}\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$$ which sends $s_1\otimes\dots\otimes s_n$ to $s_1\dots s_n$ . Indeed, since the product of sections is commutative, we obtain a surjection $$
\mathrm{Sym}^n(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)))\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))
$$ whence a surjective map $$
\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_N]_n\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$$ where $\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_N]_n\cong\mathrm{Sym}^n(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)))$ is the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ .
Assembling these maps together, we obtain a surjective homomorphism of algebras $$
\alpha:\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots, z_N]\rightarrow R(D)$$ whose kernel $I$ is a homogeneous ideal by construction of $\alpha$ ; therefore we can define the projective variety $Z=V(I)\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N$ . Furthermore, since $R(D)$ is a domain, $I$ is prime and $Z$ is irreducible. Using the isomorphism $\mathbb{C}[z_o,\dots,z_N]/I\cong R(D)$ and applying the Riemann-Roch theorem, we can see that the Hilbert polynomial of $Z$ is $p_Z(t)=\mathrm{deg}(D)t+1-g$ , so by the Hilbert-Serre theorem $Z$ has dimension $1$ (here by dimension I mean the supremum of the lengths of chains of irreducible subvarieties). Now a straightforward calculation shows $Y\subseteq Z$ . Furthermore, $Y$ is irreducible in the Zariski topology and has dimension $1$ being the image of $X$ via an embedding (here I mean, a priori, the dimension as a complex manifold). This implies $Y=Z$ . Here are my doubts: Why is $Y$ irreducible? My guess: suppose there exist homogeneous polynomials $F_1,\dots,F_r, G_1,\dots, G_s$ such that $Y=(Y\cap V(F_1,\dots,F_r))\cup (Y\cap V(G_1,\dots, G_s))$ . If $Y\cap V(F_1,\dots,F_r)$ is a proper non empty subset of $Y$ , its complement in $Y$ is open and contained in every $Y\cap V(G_j)$ . Since the restrictions of the $G_j$ on $Y$ , which is a Riemann surface, are holomorphic, they must be identically zero on $Y$ , hence $Y\subset V(G_1,\dots,G_s)$ . $Y$ is certainly a $1$ -dimensional complex manifold, but why is it $1$ -dimensional as a topological space with the Zariski topology? My guess: let $C$ be a Zariski closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^N$ : then $Y\cap C$ is either $Y$ or a finite set of points, by holomorphicity of the functions defining $C$ and compactness and ""one-dimensionality"" of $Y$ . If $Y\cap C$ is a proper Zariski irreducible subset of $Y$ , then it must be a point. Assuming the two previous points, why does the equality of the dimensions imply $Y=Z$ ? It would certainly be true if $Y$ were Zariski closed in $Z$ , but then $Y$ would be Zariski closed in $\mathbb{P}^N$ , which is exactly what we want. In general, a projective variety has the same dimension of any of its proper open subsets.

The extension to higher-order differentials, however, is what puzzles me. This is a passage from Courant: (...) it may be pointed out for the sake of completeness that we may also form second and higher differentials. For if we think of $h$ as chosen in any manner, but always the same for every value of $x$ , then $dy=hf'(x)$ is a function of $x$ , of which we can again form the differential. The result will be called the second differential of y , and will be denoted by the symbol $d^2y=d^2f(x)$ . The increment of $hf'(x)$ being $h\{f'(x+h)-f'(x)\}$ , the second differential is obtained by replacing the quantity in brackets by its linear part $hf''(x)$ , so that $d^2y=h^2f''(x)$ . We may naturally proceed further along the same lines, obtaining third, fourth, ... differentials of y, etc., which can be defined by the expressions $h^3f'''(x), h^4f^{iv}(x)$ , and so on. Two questions arise from this for me: The author writes of the second differential of a function. To arrive at it they had to arbitrarily fix some value of $h$ in order to define a new single-variable function $dy$ such that $dy(x) = hf'(x)$ for the given $h$ , and form the differential of this new function. Doesn't this procedure give rise to an infinite number of different functions, each associated with a different value of $h$ , which would, in turn, lead to an infinite number of different functions, all of which satisfy the definition of the second differential? Given that the first differential is a function of two variables, unlike the single-variable function from which it was formed, speaking of the second (and higher-order) differential as the differential of the differential doesn't seem accurate. Is there a procedure that circumvents the ""fix a value of $h$ "" argument and still leads to a rigorous definition in this context? Why is it simply assumed that the $h$ 's that multiply the higher-order derivatives in the definition of higher-order differentials are all the same ( ""third, fourth, ... differentials of y, etc., which can be defined by the expressions $h^3f'''(x), h^4f^{iv}(x)$ , and so on"" )? Shouldn't each $h$ be independent of the other, such that a more accurate description of the higher-order differentials should be $h_1h_2h_3f'''(x)$ , $h_1h_2h_3h_4f^{(4)}(x)$ ?

4424692,Symplectic Reduction of 3-D Chern Simons Theory,"So, I'm new to gauge theories and symplectic reduction and was trying to analyze the Chern Simons theory in three dimensions. I have a few questions regarding the steps towards reduction. First off, is it necessary for the bundle to be trivial? Second, how does one explicitly calulate the extremal values of the functional? I know the solution is the curvature but don't even know how to formally work out the variational derivatives. Third, when analyzing the Hamiltonian for a manifold decomposed into a 2-D surface and a time interval, how does the Legendre transform work exactly? Fourth, Atiyah-Bott says that the space of connections of the surface has a symplectic structure and somehow the curvature represents its momentum map. Any insight into this? Finally, the solutions to the system are represented as a moduli space of flat connections. How does this fit in with the previous steps? Thank you very much in advance!

4424724,What is the reason for the conventions used by modulus notation?,"Apologies in advance for what I anticipate will be a very dumb question. To give some background: I am a software architect that’s been programming since the age of 8 and professionally for the last 15 years. Never had any formal university-level training; everything I know is self taught. As such, there are unorthodox gaps in my knowledge; for example, I have in-depth knowledge of subjects like set theory or statistics (given that I primarily work on business software), but when it comes to something like calculus the extent of my knowledge is that it exists and that it’s used in advanced graphics. However, now my career may take a turn to where I need an in-depth understanding of crypthography (on a mathematical / theoretical level). So, here I am in my 30’s going back to the roots and learning abstract, theoretical math & comp sci. I’ve hired a tutor for the purpose, who is an undergrad student in a comp sci program that’s known for being very theory-focused. The question: Recently, he started teaching me modular notation. Being a software engineer, I am obviously deeply familiar with the modulus operator, and in the world of programming we use the % operator for the purpose. I.e. 3 % 5 = 3 . However, I was told that in mathematics, the notation is to arbitrarily add mod X to the end of an equation/problem block. So, everything is written as usual and there is a note at the end of the equation/problem specifying “under what modulus” everything in the problem is. This makes no sense to me whatsoever, and when I asked my tutor he said that he asked the same question in his class and the professor replied that “it’s just the way it’s done”. I understand that conventions can be unique, but this to me feels like a very radical departure from the way math is usually written down, and because of that — I feel like there has to be an underlying reason for it that I am not seeing… I am hoping that someone much more knowledgeable than me can help clarify my few questions and help it all make sense. Math is typically written left to right, with parenthesis and/or other symbols defining blocks/scopes. For example, the body of a square root can include massive formulas, but the scope of the square root is still visually defined. Same with parenthesis blocks and global operations done upon the entire block. Numbers and operations also follow in sequence, which have a value that they act on and an argument. For example, to get a sum of 4 numbers, we would write (2+5+7+8) (three individual operations), not (2,5,7,8 +) (apply this operator on all numbers in the set). But with the mod operator, it seems like it’s an arbitrarily-placed footnote at the end of a block, which on top of everything contains extremely vital information. There is no purpose to reading whatever formula is inside the block without first knowing “under what modulus” it is, so how does this work out in academia with page-long formulas? How exactly does scoping work? From my understanding, all of the below is syntactically legal: 3x = 15y mod 5 (2x + 8y) - 12z mod 5 (2x + 8y)(12z - 5x) mod 5 What happens if my problem is using a different modulus/base for different parts of the problem? Would this be legal? (3x + 4y mod 5) - (8z - 2a mod 8) ? What if I have nested clauses? I.e. (3x + (2a - 2b mod 7)^2 + 4y mod 5) - 17z mod 3 ?

4424804,Limiting Distribution with Successive Transformations,"I am not sure if this is a new problem but it is one that I thought up and have been working on for some time. Alas, I have been unable to develop a complete solution to the problem and would be interested if there are any useful techniques or insights that the community could provide. I am looking for the continuous PDF $X$ that exists over $[0,1]$ and has the following relationship with is transformation: \begin{equation}
X \sim \frac{n}{n+X}
\end{equation} where $n \overset{iid}{\sim} U(0,1)$ . What I am trying to convey here is that taking any number of transformations of the form $\frac{n_1}{n_1+X}$ , $\frac{n_2}{n_2+X}$ , etc. does not change the distribution $X$ for which we are looking. Furthermore, successive transformations such as $\frac{n_2}{n_2+\frac{n_1}{n_1+X}}$ and so on result in the same distribution $X$ for which we are looking. Attempt 1 The first approach I took was took was to try to solve for $X$ by solving for the combination of random variates $n_1, n_2, ...$ and then performing the transformation on them. This became very messy and very quickly. Alas, this solution did not provide the limiting distribution but it did provide an insight. Each successive addition of a random variate changed the distribution for $X$ . Therefore, it did not seem that standard substitution techniques may be helpful with this type of problem. Attempt 2 I noticed that the distribution on the interval from $[0,\frac{n}{n+1}]$ was always in the form of $\frac{c}{(X-1)^2}$ , where $c$ is some constant. If this was the form of the limiting distribution for that interval, then perhaps I could apply the transformation on that segment of the distribution to gain insight about the remaining distribution $X$ . This too became very messy, very quickly but with the help of Mathematica, I was able to get an approximation of the distribution which would seems much closer to the real distribution than in my first attempt. The results I obtained were (apologies for the math wall): \begin{align}

Additional Desire I am not sure if this is yet possible either but I am trying to track how the maximum value of the distribution progresses over time.

\Sigma_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+(1-\delta_{ij})\tilde{\rho}
$ , i.e. all off-diagonal entries of $\Sigma$ are $\tilde{\rho}$ . Since all components $x_i$ have unit variance (i.e. diagonal entries of $\Sigma$ are $1$ ), $\tilde{\rho}$ is then the correlation of any pair $(x_i,x_j)$ . Note that all single component marginals $p(\xi_i)=1/2$ , i.e. the coins are unbiased; we can always set the value of $\tilde{\rho}$ so that any pair $(\xi_i,\xi_j)$ has the desired correlation of $\rho$ . What is the formula for the entropy of $p(\xi_1,...\xi_N)$ , denoted $H_N(\rho)$ ? The parametrization of $\tilde{\rho}$ by $\rho$ depends on $N$ and is obtained by calculating the pair marginal probability $p(\xi_i=1,\xi_j=1)$ , denoted $p_{11}$ . Let $f_N(\tilde{\rho})$ be the function of $\tilde{\rho}$ that gives this probability. The formula for the correlation between two binary random variables, $$

In this special case, $(\mathrm{eq}.1)$ and symmetry constraints completely specify the distribution $p(\xi_1,\xi_2)=(1+\xi_1\xi_2\rho)/4$ . Calculation of the entropy from its definition gives $$
H_{N=2}(\rho)=H(\xi_1,\xi_2)=\sum_{\eta=(1\pm\rho)/4}2\left(-\eta\log_2\eta\right).
$$ We have $H_{N=2}(0)=2$ bits and $H_{N=2}(1)=1$ bit. In fact, we know $H_N(\rho=0)=N$ and $H_N(\rho=1)=1$ for all $N$ . For $N>2$ : There are lots of Gaussian integrals to do. Due to the symmetry in the index permutations there are only $N$ distinct integral values among the $2^N$ terms in the entropy. They can be grouped by how many 1s they contain. The pair of all $-1$ s can be grouped with the singleton group of all $1$ s due to the reflective symmetry in the plane normal to the main diagonal. We just need compute the multiplicity and the integral for each of the $N$ terms. E.g. for $N=2$ there are 2 terms (listed above with multiplicity 2). For $N=3$ there are three terms (two for tuples containing one and two 1s), the third being the extreme group having $(-1,-1,-1)$ and $(1,1,1)$ in binary notation. In section 3.2 of this paper , Six gives a recursive solution to the distribution. This could be used to compute the entropy and the parametrization function $\tilde{\rho}_N(\rho)$ . Accepted Answer : In the end, an alternative approach based on expressing $x_i=\sqrt{1-\tilde{\rho}}y_i+\sqrt{\tilde{\rho}}s$ , with $y_i,s\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ , seems to be more straightforward and is the accepted answer below. That answer also indicates that the $f_N(\tilde{\rho})$ does NOT seem to depend on $N$ after all.","['entropy', 'probability-distributions', 'information-theory', 'multiple-integral', 'probability']"
