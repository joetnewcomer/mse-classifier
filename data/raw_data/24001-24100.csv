210408,Embedding compact (boundaryless?) $n$-manifolds in $n$-dimensional real space,"I know the embedding theorems that allow you to embed $n$-manifolds into $\mathbb{R}^k$, provided $k$ is chosen large enough. Here I'm interested in the possibility of taking $k=n$ in the case of compact manifolds. From the classification of compact surfaces I can see that the closed ones cannot be embedded in the plane, and that the ones that can be embedded are disks and annuli, which have non empty boundary. I'd like to know if this intuition is still sound in dimension $n\geq 3$, so my question is: if a compact manifold of dimension $n$ embeds in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is it forced to have a non empty boundary? I've read the wiki article about Whitney embedding and it's section about ""sharper results"", but there they give general estimates for the whole class of compact $n$-manifolds, whereas I would be interested in just a single example of a compact boundaryless $n$-manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (possibly in low dimensions), or a proof/reference if this can never happen. Notice I'm not interested in distinction between orientable/non-orientable manifolds, but in the presence of a boundary.

210461,Showing that two variables do no have a bivariate normal distribution,"If $X_1$ is $N(0,1)$ and $X_2 = -X_1$ if $-1 \leq X_1 \leq 1$ or $X_2 = X_1$ otherwise, how do you prove that $X_1$ and $X_2$ do not have a bivariate normal distribution? Attempt: Using the Jacobian method I proved that the distribution of $X_2$ is the standard normal distribution. To prove that $X_1$ and $X_2$ do not have a bivariate normal distribution there is a hint that says to consider the linear combination $X_1-X_2$ where $P(X_1-X_2) = P(|X_1|>1) = 0.3174$.","['statistics', 'probability']"
210497,Proof of residue theorem (residue formula) for differential forms on curves over an arbitrary closed field.,"I have been reading the book Algebraic Geometric Codes: Basic Notions by Tsfasman, Vladut and Nogin. They give a residue formula like this (Proposition 2.2.20, p. 97): Let $\mathbb{k}$ be an algebraically closed field and $X$ be a smooth projective curve over $\mathbb{k}$ . Let $\omega$ be a rational differential form on $X$ . Then, $\displaystyle\sum_{P \in X}^{} Res_P(\omega) = 0$ Here $P$ denotes the points on the curve $X$ and $Res_P(\omega)$ denotes the residues of $\omega$ at points $P$ . I know that this can easily be derived with the help of Green's/Stoke's theorems in case where $\mathbb{k} = \mathbb{C}$ , as $X$ will then have the natural structure of a Riemann surface and things like integrals will start making sense. But, I am unable to prove it for an arbitrary algebraically closed field $\mathbb{k}$ other than $\mathbb{C}$ .","['differential-forms', 'residue-calculus', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry']"

He starts by showing the Borromean rings are analgous in some way to standard three space. I would like to explore this idea further, hopefully in a more formal exposition.  So, I wuld like to ask: (1) does anyone know of a written reference to the idea Thurston presents.  Did he (or someone else?) write a paper on the subject?

210607,In what sense is the Jeffreys prior invariant?,"I've been trying to understand the motivation for the use of the Jeffreys prior in Bayesian statistics. Most texts I've read online make some comment to the effect that the Jeffreys prior is ""invariant with respect to transformations of the parameters"", and then go on to state its definition in terms of the Fisher information matrix without further motivation. However, none of them then go on to show that such a prior is indeed invariant, or even to properly define what was meant by ""invariant"" in the first place. I like to understand things by approaching the simplest example first, so I'm interested in the case of a binomial trial, i.e. the case where the support is $\{1,2\}$. In this case the Jeffreys prior is given by
$$
\rho(\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{\theta(1-\theta)}}, \qquad\qquad(i)
$$
where $\theta$ is the parameterisation given by $p_1 = \theta$, $p_2 = 1-\theta$. What I would like is to understand the sense in which this is invariant with respect to a coordinate transformation $\theta \to \varphi(\theta)$. To me the term ""invariant"" would seem to imply something along the lines of
$$
\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \rho(\theta) d \theta =
\int_{\varphi(\theta_1)}^{\varphi(\theta_2)} \rho(\varphi(\theta)) d \varphi  \qquad\qquad(ii)
$$
for any (smooth, differentiable) function $\varphi$ -- but it's easy enough to see that this is not satisfied by the distribution $(i)$ above (and indeed, I doubt there can be any density function that does satisfy this kind of invariance for any transformation). So there must be some other sense intended by ""invariant"" in this context. I would like to understand this sense in the form of a functional equation similar to $(ii)$, so that I can see how it's satisfied by $(i)$. Progress As did points out, the Wikipedia article gives a hint about this, by starting with 
$$
p(\theta)\propto\sqrt{I(\theta)}
$$
and deriving
$$
p(\varphi)\propto\sqrt{I(\varphi)}
$$
for any smooth function $\varphi(\theta)$. (Note that these equations omit taking the Jacobian of $I$ because they refer to a single-variable case.) Clearly something is invariant here, and it seems like it shouldn't be too hard to express this invariance as a functional equation. However, the more I try to do this the more confused I get. Partly this is because there's just a lot left out of the Wikipedia sketch (e.g. are the constants of proportionality the same in the two equations above, or different? Where is the proof of uniqueness?) but mostly it's because it's really unclear exactly what's being sought, which is why I wanted to express it as a functional equation in the first place. To reiterate my question, I understand the above equations from Wikipedia, and I can see that they demonstrate an invariance property of some kind. However, I can't see how to express this invariance property in the form of a functional equation similar to $(ii)$ , which is what I'm looking for as an answer to this question. I want to first understand the desired invariance property, and then see that the Jeffrey's prior (hopefully uniquely) satisfies it, but the above equations mix up those two steps in a way that I can't see how to separate.","['statistics', 'information-theory', 'probability-theory']"
210630,What does the value of a probability density function (PDF) at some x indicate?,"I understand that the probability mass function of a discrete random-variable X is $y=g(x)$.

Wikipedia defines this function $y$ to mean In probability theory, a probability density function (pdf), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a given value. I am confused about the meaning of 'relative likelihood' because it certainly does not mean probability! The probability $P(X<x_0)$ is given by some integral of the pdf.

This result jars with me, because from matrix calculus I know that $\frac{\partial}{\partial \textbf{b}} \textbf{A}\textbf{b} = \textbf{A}^T$, and since the integral is effectively a sum then by analogy I would expect that $\frac{\partial}{\partial f(x)}I = g(x+y)$.

(a) Show that $|f(z)|$ attains its minimum on $D$, then $f(z)$ is constant. (b) Show that if $D$ is bounded, and if $D$ is bounded, and if $f(z)$ extends continuously to the boundary $\partial D$ of $D$, then $|f(z)|$ attains its minimum on $\partial D$. I solved part (a), but part (b) is giving me trouble. Namely, I define $g(z)=1/f(z)$, but how do I know that f(z) doesn't have a zero on $\partial D$? I have to make that extra assumption in my proof below... And if it helps any, the book assumes D is simply connected as well. Heres my progess: Part $(a):$ Let $f(z)$ be an analytic function on a domain $D$ that has no zeroes on $D$. Suppose $|f(z)|$ attains a minimum on $D$ at $z_0$, denoted $M$. Since $f(z)$ has no zeroes on $D$, and is analytic, $g(z)=1/f(z)$ is analytic. It follows that $|g(z)|=|1/f(z)|\le 1/M$ for all $z\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $|g(z_0)|=1/M$. So, since $g(z)$ is analytic, it is also harmonic, and thus by the Strict Maximum Principle, $g(z)$ is constant, implying $f(z)$ is constant. Part $(b):$ Let $f(z)$ be an analytic function on a domain $D$ that has no zeroes on $D$ and $\partial D$. Suppose that $D$ is bounded and connected and that $f(z)$ extends continuously to $\partial D$. Then $D\cup\partial D$ is compact, as it contains its boundary and is bounded. Let $g(z)=1/f(z)$, then since $f(z)$ has no zeroes, $g(z)$ is defined over all of $D\cup\partial D$, and since its a continuous real-valued function on a compact set, it attains a maximum, denoted $M$ at $z_0$. Then $g(z)=1/f(z)\le M$, implying $f(z)\ge 1/M$ for all $z\in\mathbb{Z}$, and since $g(z_0)=M$, it follows that $f(z_0)=1/M$. If $f(z)$ obtains a minimum in $D$, it follows from part $(a)$ that $f(z)$ is constant and thus obtains its minimum on $\partial$$D$, and thus $f(z)$ always obtains its minimum on $\partial D$.",['complex-analysis']

Show that $\chi(1)^2=|G:Z(G)|$ for every nonlinear $\chi\in Irr(G)$. I proceed as follows : Let $\chi$ be a nonlinear character of $G$. Since $G'\subseteq Z(G)=\cap Z(\chi)$ then $G'\subseteq Z(\chi)$. Therefore $G/Z(\chi)$ is abelian. By THeorem 2.31, we have that 
$$\chi(1)^2=|G:Z(\chi)| $$ 
We would like to prove that $Z(G)=Z(\chi)$. We just need to prove the converse. Assume that $g\in Z(\chi)$, we need to prove that $g\in Z(G)$,i.e., commutes with all $h\in G$. Let $h\in G$, then we need to prove that $[g,h]=1$. Since $[g,h]\in G'\subset Z(\chi)$, then $[g,h]^p=1$ since $|G'|=p$. Moreover, $g\in Z(\chi)$ implies that $[g,h]\in Ker\chi$, and so $\chi([g,h])=\chi(1)>1$, since $\chi$ is nonlinear. But then, at this stage, I dont know how to proceed to get $[g,h]=1$.

But if $X$ is a scheme (say of finite type) over any field, then I saw a definition of the first Chern class $c_1(L)$ just via its action on the Chow group of $X$, namely, on cycles it works as follows: for a $k$-dimensional subvariety $V\subset X$ one defines \begin{equation}
c_1(L)\cap [V]=[C],

where F = # of events in the forward hemisphere, B = # of events
in the backward hemisphere and N = F + B = total # of events. We were told to assume F and B were two independent Poisson distributions,
with the total # of events N given by F + B and hence N was variable
(i.e. not fixed). $P_{A_{FB}}=P_{P}(F;v_{F})\cdot P_{P}(B;v_{B})=\frac{(v_{F})^{F}}{F!}e^{-v_{F}}\cdot\frac{(v_{B})^{B}}{B!}e^{-v_{B}}$ Now we want to use the characteristic function $\Phi_{n}(k;v_{n})=e^{-v_{n}(e^{ik}-1)}$
associated with the Poisson distribution to show that the total number
of events N = F + B is also Poisson-distributed, (i.e. $P_{P}(N;v_{N})=\frac{(v_{N})^{N}}{N!}e^{-v_{N}}$
, with mean/expected number of events $v_{N}=v_{F}+v_{B}$ and variance
$v_{N}=N=F+B$). My attempt at a solution: I know that the way this was expected to be solved was to leverage the fact that
$\Phi_{N}(k;v_{n})=\Phi_{F+B}(k;v_{n})=\Phi_{F}(k;v_{F})\Phi_{B}(k;v_{B})$. We then determine:
 $P_{P}(N;v_{N})=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}e^{-ikN}\Phi_{F}(k;v_{F})\Phi_{B}(k;v_{B})=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}e^{-ikF}\Phi_{F}(k;v_{F})e^{-ikB}\Phi_{B}(k;v_{B})=P_{P}(F;v_{F})\cdot P_{P}(B;v_{B})$ and monkey around with the algebra from there to prove the statement in the prompt. However, I wasted quite a bit of time trying to evaluate the infinite sum over k directly and prove it an alternate way: $P_{P}(N;v_{N})=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}e^{-ikN}\Phi_{F}(k;v_{F})\Phi_{B}(k;v_{B})
=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}e^{-ikN} e^{-(v_{F}+v_{B})(e^{ik}-1)}$. I tried to do this:
${e}^{(v_{F}+v_{B})}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(v_{F}+v_{B})^{k}}{{k!}}$ and put this back into the expression like so: 
$P_{P}(N;v_{N})=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(v_{F}+v_{B})^{k}}{{k!}}e^{-ikN}e^{-(v_{F}+v_{B})e^{ik}}$ But after this I could go no farther. Collecting these terms into something like $\frac{(expression)^{k}}{k!}$ to hopefully make it look like another exponent series expansion does not work because of the $e^{e^{ik}}$ term. -This is the first time I have ever seen any function that contains a double exponential. How does one usually deal with these? There seems to be no decent Taylor series representation, unless $e^{e^{x}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{(e^{x})^{i}}{i!}$ but I am not sure is this is a useful sum or even allowed. -Is breaking down an exponent that does not depend on k (the index in the infinite sum) into an infinite series that does depend on k allowed, or do I have to use different indices, such as turning the exponential into an infinite sum over j? -How can I evaluate the probability I want by using Fourier inversion on the characteristic function with n=N and then solving the infinite sum over k?

My current method (for when $n$ is a power of $2$) is to note that all of the angle that sin is being evaluated on are evenly distributed between $0$ and $\pi$, but more importantly, one of the angles will always be $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and all angles which are greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ can be re-written as the cos of an angle that is less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (using the complementary angle). When this is done, we get $$\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\sin\frac{k \pi}{n} = \prod_{k = 1}^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{1}{2}\sin\frac{2k\pi}{n} = \frac{1}{2^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}}\prod_{k = 1}^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}\sin\frac{k\pi}{\frac{n}{2}}$$ This process can then be repeated recursively until we have just one $\sin$ term left in the product (which will be $\sin\frac{\pi}{2}$), then what is left is equivalent to $$\frac{n}{2^{n - 1}}\;.$$ Can anyone suggest a way of generalizing this to when $n$ is not a power of $2$?

  continuous, and $g(x)=G'(x)$ for $a \leq x \leq b$. Prove that, $$\int_a^b\alpha(x)g(x)\,dx=G(b)\alpha(b)-G(a)\alpha(a)-\int_a^bG\,d\alpha.$$ It seems to me that the continuity of $g$ is not necessary for the result above. It is enough to assume that $g$ is Riemann integrable. Am I right in thinking this? I have thought as follows: $\int_a^bG\,d\alpha$ exists because $G$ is differentiable and hence continuous. $\alpha(x)$ is integrable with respect to $x$ since it is monotonic. If $g(x)$ is also integrable with respect to $x$ then $\int_a^b\alpha(x)g(x)\,dx$ also exists. To prove the given formula, I start from the hint given by Rudin
$$\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha(x_i)g(t_i)\Delta x_i=G(b)\alpha(b)-G(a)\alpha(a)-\sum_{i=1}^nG(x_{i-1})\Delta \alpha_i$$
where $g(t_i)\Delta x_i=\Delta G_i$ by the intermediate mean value theorem. Now the sum on the right-hand side converges to $\int_a^bG\,d\alpha$. The sum on the left-hand side would have converged to $\int_a^b\alpha(x)g(x)\,dx$ if it had been
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha(x_i)g(x_i)\Delta x$$
The absolute difference between this and what we have is bounded above by
$$\max(|\alpha(a)|,|\alpha(b)|)\sum_{i=1}^n |g(x_i)-g(t_i)|\Delta x$$
