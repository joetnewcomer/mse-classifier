271256,Scaling of random variables,"Note: I will use $\mathbb{P}\{X \in dx\}$ to denote $f(x)dx$ where $f(x)$ is the pdf of $X$. While doing some homework, I came across a fault in my intuition. I was scaling a standard normally distributed random variable $Z$. Edit: I was missing the infinitesimals $dx$ and $dx/c$, so everything works out in the end. Thank you Jokiri! $$\mathbb{P}\{cX \in dx\} = \frac{e^{-x^2 / 2c^2}}{\sqrt{2\pi c^2}}$$
while
$$\mathbb{P} \left\{X \in \frac{dx}{c}\right\} = \frac{e^{-(x/c)^2/2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$$ Could anyone help me understand why the following equality doesn't hold? Edit: it does, see edit below $$\mathbb{P}\{cX \in dx\} \ne  \mathbb{P} \left\{X \in \frac{dx}{c}\right\}$$ I have been looking around, and it seems that equality of the cdf holds, though:
$$\mathbb{P}\{cX < x \} = \mathbb{P}\left\{X < \frac xc\right\}.$$ Thank you in advance! This question came out of a silly mistake on my part. Let me attempt to try to set things straight. Let $Y = cX$. Let $X$ have pdf $f_X$ and $Y$ have pdf $f_Y$. $$\mathbb{E}[Y] = \mathbb{E}[cX] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty cx\,f_X(x)\mathop{dx}
=\int_{-\infty}^\infty y\, f_X(y/c) \frac{dy}{c}$$ So, $f_Y(y) = \frac 1c f_X(y/c)$. Thank you for the help, and sorry for my mistake.",['probability']

271270,Do field automorphisms of a character imply outer automorphisms of the group?,"Apologies for the imprecise wording of the title. In studying the basic representation theory of finite groups, I've been struck by a pair of phenomena present in every example I've worked with but not mentioned in any texts I've studied. I am wondering if either or both of these phenomena is true in general, or perhaps true under some assumptions that are usually satisfied for small groups. Phenomenon #1: We are given a finite group $G$ and a representation $\rho:G\rightarrow GL(V)$ on a complex vector space $V$, with character $\chi$.  Suppose $\chi(a)$ is an algebraic irrational, say $\alpha$, for some conjugacy class $a$ of $G$.  Then for any conjugate $\alpha'$ of $\alpha$ (i.e. another root of $\alpha$'s minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$), there exists a conjugacy class $a'$ of $G$, of the same size as $a$, such that $\chi(a')=\alpha'$. Phenomenon #2: Furthermore, there is an outer automorphism of $G$ that carries $a$ to $a'$. Are these patterns at all general? If so, what assumptions are needed for them to hold?  If not, what are some counterexamples? Thanks so much!","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'representation-theory']"
271272,"Is there a general solution for the ""Spider and the Fly Problem""?","(I would be appreciative if somebody could give a more formal formulation of this problem.) The Spider and the Fly Problem is a problem in which the objective is to minimize the distance the spider must travel to reach the fly on the other side of the room. The spider can only move on the surface of the room. Let S be the point where the spider is, and F be the point where the fly is. One is given the length of YG, GF, PH, and HS, as well as the length, width and height of the rectangular prism. Assume that the fly and spider stay on their respective sides, but aside from that, their points are not necessarily where they are placed on the diagram. Is there a general formula for calculating the shortest distance between the spider and the fly? (Is there a general formula for the geodesic of the cuboid?) I solved the original spider and the fly problem (by just creating meshes of the cube and getting lucky), but I don't see how I could generalize the result, especially as the spider and fly do not have to be at the same position they are in the original problem. In the original problem, the spider is centered and one unit from the top, and the fly is centered and one unit from the bottom. I've tried considering the simpler case where the fly and spider remain in the same spot, but I still couldn't generalize it, especially for more extreme cases (if we make the height very large compared to the others, our line will go off the mesh, I'm not sure how to deal with this.) I looked online for any hints about the problem, and the the Mathworld Page used the word ""geodesic"" to describe the solution. I did some more research, but could only find solutions for the sphere and some other 3d shapes. I also couldn't find any page describing a general solution to the problem, only pages using the meshes of the rectangular prism as a solution.","['geometry', 'mathematical-modeling']"

But I'm just going to write them anyway. My first thought was that since $hnh^{-1} \in N$, $hnh^{-1} = n^r$ for some $r$ and we can show $r$ must be 1, but this went nowhere. My second approach was to write, without lost of generality, $h=aba^{-1}b^{-1}$. Then the result becomes $a^{-1}b^{-1}nba = b^{-1}a^{-1}nab$ for any two elements $a$, $b$ of $G$.

271319,Polynomial approximation of circle or ellipse,"Trying again, with a somewhat simpler sounding question, since my previous one ( Generalizations of equi-oscillation criterion ) got zero response: Let $F:[0,1] \to R^2$ be a parametric polynomial curve of degree $m$. I want to adjust the coefficients of $F$ to make it lie as closely as possible to the unit circle, $C$. More specifically, I want to have $F(0) = (1,0)$, and $F(1) = (0,1)$, and I want the maximum distance 
$$E_1 = \max \{dist(F(t),C): t \in [0,1]\}$$
to be minimized. It would be OK to minimize the following error $E_2$ instead, if it's easier: $$ E_2 = \max \{ \big| F_x^2(t) + F_y^2(t) - 1 \big|: t \in [0,1]\}$$ What if I replace the unit circle by an ellipse (for example). Two specific questions: (1) Can we prove that the best approximation is equi-oscillatory, in some sense ? (2) How can the best approximation be computed ? This site http://spencermortensen.com/articles/bezier-circle/ has a good result for the case of a circle with ($m=3$). You could also think of this as a question about Bezier curves of degree $m$. Clearly, it would be a good idea to set the first control point equal to $(1,0)$, and the last one equal to $(0,1)$. Then, we just need to adjust the other control points until we get an optimal fit. A simple algebraic version of the problem: Find two polynomials $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ such that $x(0)=1$, $x(1)=0$, $y(0)=0$, $y(1)=1$, and $x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 - 1$ is small for all $t \in [0,1]$.","['geometry', 'approximation-theory', 'bezier-curve', 'polynomials']"
271322,Almost sure convergence example,"Edit: *facepalm* I'm working through old qualifying exams, and I got the first two parts of this problem, but am stuck on the last part. Here's the set up: Let $X$ be a random variable with pdf $f(x)=c(3+x), \text{ if } -3<x<2$ (zero elsewhere). The part I haven't figured out is finding the almost sure limit of $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq X_i \leq 1\}} X_i^3$, where $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ is a random sample from $X$, and $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function. I'm trying to make use of $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P\Big(|Y_n-Y|>\epsilon \Big)<\infty \implies Y_n \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}Y.$$ So (hoping that it converges to zero), by Markov's inequality, I wrote 
$$P\Bigg(\Bigg|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq X_i \leq 1\}} X_i^3\Bigg|>\epsilon \Bigg) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}\Big[\Big|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}_{\{0\leq X_i \leq 1\}} X_i^3\Big|\Big]}{\epsilon}.$$
Now, I know that $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}_A]=P(A)$, and that if $U$ and $V$ are independent, then $\mathbb{E}[UV]=\mathbb{E}[U]\mathbb{E}[V]$, but I don't know if we have independence here (between indicators and $X_i$'s).

271441,Connected subspaces,"I guess there's something wrong with my thoughts about connectedness seen in a subspace of a topological space and I need your help. Let me explain: These are the definitions I have: A topological space $X$ is said to be disconnected if there are disjoint nonempty open sets $U, V\subset X$ such that $X=U\cup V$. A subspace $Y$ of $X$ is disconnected if it is disconnected considered as a space endowed with the relative topology to $Y$. But I have just come across this exercise in Willard's General Topology that says: Among the criteria for a subspace $E$ of $X$ to be connected, the following was absent: $E\subset X$ is disconnected iff there are disjoint open sets $H$ and $K$ in $X$, each meeting $E$, such that $E\subset H\cup K$. Find a counterexample. This really confuses me and I haven't found any counterexample yet. If we had such sets $H$ and $K$, we could then consider $E_H=E\cap H$  and $E_K=E\cap K$, and have $E=E_H\cup E_K$. Therefore, $E$ is disconnected because we can express it as the union of a pair of disjoint nonempty open sets relative to the subspace topology. I can't see what is wrong about it, but there must be a mistake somewhere.",['general-topology']

271449,Index of a Fredholm Operator on Paths,"I'm a novice to analysis but I need to understand the following example. Any help would be greatly appreciated. This might be of interest to some because it gives a way of quantifying changes in eigenspaces as the index of a Fredholm operator. Let $\alpha: (-\infty,\infty) \to Sym^2(\Bbb{R}^n)^\vee$ be a path to the space of symmetric $n\times n$ real matrices such that $\alpha$ is constant near $-\infty$, and constant near $\infty$. I'll denote these two constant values by $\alpha(\pm \infty)$. Consider the differential operator $$ d_\alpha(X):= {\partial_s}X + \alpha(s)X$$ which takes a path $X: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R^n$ and outputs another path $d_\alpha X$.
I declare the domain to be the space of $W^{1,2}$ maps $X: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R^n$, and naturally the target is the space of $L^2$ maps. (Here $W^{1,2}$ is the Sobolev space of $L^2$ maps whose first derivatives are $L^2$ too.) To calculate the index of $d_\alpha$, I further expand the domain by taking the direct sum with the finite-dimensional vector space spanned by $X$ of the form
$$
X(s) = \exp(-s \lambda ) v
$$
where $\lambda$ is a negative eigenvalue of $\alpha(\infty)$ and $v$ is an eigenvector for $\lambda$. One easily sees that $d_\alpha X$ indeed lands in $L^2$ so we have an operator
$$
\tilde  d_\alpha: 
W^{1,2}(\Bbb R , \Bbb R^n) \oplus \{(e^{-s \lambda} v)\}
\to
L^2(\Bbb R , \Bbb R^n).
$$ Now, I want to prove three things: (1) that the kernel of this operator is finite-dimensional, and
  identified with the negative eigenvalue eigenspace of
  $\alpha(-\infty)$, (2) that this map is surjective, and (3) that as a result, $\text{index}(d_\alpha) = \dim \sigma_-(\alpha(-\infty)) -\dim \sigma_-(\alpha(\infty))$, where $\sigma_-$ is the space of vectors with negative eigenvalues. Here's how I've gone about proving these statements, but I'm stuck in all claims. (1) To see this, let $\{v_i\}$ be an eigenbasis for $\alpha(-\infty)$ and $\lambda_i$ the corresponding eigenvalues, writing $X(s) = \sum x_i(s) v_i$ near $-\infty$. Then the equation $\tilde d_\alpha = 0$ breaks into first-order ODEs in one variable:
$$
\partial_s x_i + \lambda_i x_i = 0.
$$
This has the obvious solutions $x_i(s) = \exp(-s \lambda_i)v_i$, but -- to be in $W^{1,2}$ -- $\lambda_i$ must be a negative eigenvalue. (Otherwise the integral $\int_{-\infty}^s |X(s)|^2$ will blow up.) I now want to say that, since we have identified what a solution $X$ must look like near $-\infty$, by the existence of first-order ODEs, every solution near $-\infty$ extends to a full solution, and by uniqueness of first-order ODEs, this determines all solutions as in one-to-one correspondence with the space of all eigenvectors of $\alpha(-\infty)$ with negative eigenvalue. Here is my question: Does the usual proof of uniqueness and existence of solutions guarantee that my solutions will indeed be in $W^{1,2}$? If you have a reference (or a quick proof) that the $L^2$ norms of both $X$ and its derivative are bounded, I'd be very grateful. Note that $\alpha$ is constant near $\pm \infty$, so its values and derivatives are bounded, but I'm not sure if this is enough. (2) Let $Y(s)$ be some $L^2$ path. We want to exhibit $X(s)$ such that $\tilde d_\alpha X = Y$. This time, take an eigenbasis for $\alpha(\infty)$, calling it $w_i$, with corresponding eigenvalues $\nu_i$. Again the equation splits into the components of $w_i$ and we are left to solve the first-order ODE
$$
\partial_s x_i + \nu_i x_i = y_i.
$$
Using the usual tricks from calculus, we see that a solution to this is given by
$$
x_i(s) = {\int_{s_0}^s y_i(t) e^{\nu_i t} dt \over e^{\nu_i s} }.
$$
One can extend this to a full solution . Again, my question is: How can one guarantee that such a solution is in $W^{1,2}$? And does it require a clever addition of a function of the form $\exp(-\nu_is)w_i$ to exhibit an $L^2$ solution? (3) To see this, I can just add the indices of each Fredholm operator in the composition
$$
W^{1,2}(\Bbb R , \Bbb R^n) 
\to
W^{1,2}(\Bbb R , \Bbb R^n) \oplus \text{span}(e^{-s \lambda} v)
\to
L^2(\Bbb R , \Bbb R^n).

271597,Can the $\Xi(t)$ function be extended this way?,"In 1893 Hadamard proved that: $$\xi(s) = \xi(0) \prod_{\rho} \left(1- \frac{s}{\rho} \right) \left(1- \frac{s}{1-\rho} \right)$$ where $\xi(z) = \frac12 z(z-1) \pi^{-\frac{z}{2}} \Gamma(\frac{z}{2}) \zeta(z)$ and $\rho = \sigma + \gamma i$ is a non-trivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ (i.e. $\gamma_n$ is the imaginary part of the n-th $\rho)$). Riemann had already conjectured this in 1859 and since he needed an 'always real' function for his next thought steps, he assumed $s=\frac12 + t i$ and defined the function $\Xi(t)=\xi(s)$ that has been proven to be equal to: $$\Xi(t)= \Xi(0)\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$$ It is known that $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$ and $\xi(s)=\overline{\xi(\overline{s})}$ and this implies that $\xi(s)\xi(\overline{s})$ must be real. Also known is that when there is a non-trivial zero $\rho$ lying off the critical line, then also $1-\rho, \overline{\rho}, \overline{1-\rho}$ must be zeros and their product will always be real: $$\displaystyle\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma+i \gamma}\right)
\left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma-i \gamma}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}\right)
\left(1-\frac{s}{\overline{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}}\right)$$ This brought me to the following conjecture. Suppose $s=a+t i$ and $\Xi_a(t)=\xi(s)$ so $\Xi_a(0)=\xi(a)$, then the following product holds and is always real: $$\Xi_a(t)\Xi_a(-t) = \Xi_a(0)^2\prod_\gamma \left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{(-t)^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$$ or simpler: $$\Xi_a(t)\Xi_a(-t) = \left(\xi(a)\prod_\gamma \left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)\right)^2$$ Numerical tests indicate that the conjecture is correct, but I am obvioulsy keen to find a proof (I do realise this is a way too big of a question to ask here!).

Observe that $$n \log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} \right) \leq n \log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|}{n} \right)^2 = 2n \log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|}{n} \right) \leq 2n \frac{|f(x)|}{n} = 2|f(x)|.$$ Then $n \log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} \right)$ is dominated by $2|f(x)|$. Moreover, we have $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} \right)}{1/n} = \frac{0}{0}.$$ So we apply L'Hopital's Rule and we obtain: $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} \right)}{1/n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\frac{-|f(x)|^2}{n^2} (-n^2)}{ 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} } = |f(x)|^2.$$ Then by Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, we conclude that $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_X n \log \left( 1 + \frac{|f(x)|^2}{n} \right) \,dm(x) = \int_X |f(x)|^2 \,dm(x).$$ Where is the proof wrong?

271792,Proof of Irrationality of e using Diophantine Equations,"I was trying to prove that e is irrational without using the typical series expansion, so starting off $e = a/b $ Take the natural log so $1 = \ln(a/b)$ Then $1 = \ln(a)-\ln(b)$ So unless I did something horribly wrong showing the irrationality of $e$ is the same as showing that the equation $c = \ln(a)-\ln(b)$ or $1 = \ln(a) - \ln(b)$ (whichever one is easiest) has no solutions amongst the natural numbers.

271975,Symmetric polynomial optimization,"Recently I asked a stupid question here (there’s no harm in that, even Fields medalist Terence Tao advises to ask dumb questions once in a while).
Here is a variant question that may be more difficult, perhaps even suitable for MathOverflow. Let $n\geq 3$, and $a,b$ be two positive numbers with $\frac{a}{n} \gt b^{\frac{1}{n}}$ ; then the set $$
K= \bigg\lbrace (x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_n) \in (0,\infty)^n \bigg| \sum_{k=1}^nx_k=a, \  \prod_{k=1}^nx_k=b
\bigg\rbrace
$$ is nonempty and compact (it is included in $[0,a]^n$), and its boundary is homeomorphic to $S^{n-2}$ (a nice argument shows this here ). 
Let $f$ be a symmetric polynomial in $x_1,x_2, \ldots,x_n$. Then $f$ attains a minimum $m$ on $K$. Let us call a point $p=(p_1,p_2, \ldots ,p_n)$ of $K$ extremist if all its coordinates are equal but one (in other words, there is an index $i$ such that the  set $\lbrace p_j\rbrace_{j \neq i}$ is a singleton). Also, call it weakly extremist if some two coordinates of $p$ are equal. Is it true that $m$ is always attained at an extremist point (we are of course not forbidding $f$ from also attaining $m$ at other, non-extremist points, which will certainly happen is $f$ is constant for example) ? Is it true that $m$ is always attained at a weakly extremist point? My progress so far on this problem : I can show that the answer is YES to both the questions when $n=3$. Indeed, by the fundamental theorem for symmetric polynomials it suffices to treat the special case $f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_2x_3$. Then for $(x_1,x_2,x_3) \in K$, $x_1$ varies in an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the two smallest roots of the polynomial $P=x(a-x)^2-4b$. Also, $$
f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=x_1(a-x_1)+\frac{b}{x_1}=g(x_1)
$$
On the interval $[\alpha,\beta]$, the derivative $g’$ has two simple zeros, one at $\beta’=\frac{a-\beta}{2}$ and the other at $\alpha’=\frac{a-\alpha}{2}$. If we put $m=g(\beta)$ and $M=g(\alpha)$, then $M=g(\alpha)=g(\alpha’)$ and $m=g(\beta)=g(\beta’)$, so that the original interval $I=[\alpha,\beta]$ can be decomposed as $$
I=I_1 \cup I_2 \cup I_3, \ \ I_1=[\alpha,\beta’], \ I_2=[\beta’,\alpha’], \ I_3=[\alpha’,\beta]
$$
and for $i=1,2,3$, we see that $g$ restricts to a bijection $I_i \to [m,M]$. So the minimum $m$ is attained at the extremist point $(\beta,\beta’,\beta’)$ and the maximum $M$ is attained at the extremist point $(\alpha,\alpha’,\alpha’)$.","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'polynomials']"

I am intrested to know the answer to this question. I am also very interested to see any counterexamples (if there are any). Thank you.","['inequality', 'integration', 'measure-theory', 'integral-inequality', 'real-analysis']"
272021,Doubt about temporal derivative of a partial derivative,I have $\theta (t)$ and $\phi (t)$ and I have to find: $$\frac {d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \cos(\theta - \phi)\dot \theta \dot\phi}{\partial \dot\theta}\right) $$ Why the correct result is $$\cos(\theta-\phi)\ddot \phi+\sin(\theta-\phi)\dot \phi^2$$ instead of $$-\sin(\theta-\phi)(\dot \theta-\dot\phi)\dot\phi+\cos(\theta-\phi)\ddot\phi$$ Thanks for any help!,['derivatives']
272025,Find derivative of convolution with gaussian,"Let $A(\sigma)$, $\sigma > 0$ be an operator that acts on bounded continuous functions $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ by the rule
$$
   (A(t)f)(x) = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} f(y)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi t}}\exp\left( -\frac{(x-y)^2}{2t} \right)dy,
$$
and let $(A(0)f)(x) = f(x)$. Then $(A(t)f)(x) \to f(x)$ when $t \to +0$. But is it true in general that
$$
   \left(\frac{ A(t) - A(0)}{t}f\right)(x) \to \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x), \;\;\; t \to +0
$$
for any $C^2(\mathbb{R})$ bounded function $f$? If $f(x)$ is bounded and continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ then $u(t,x)=(A(t)f)(x)$ is a solution of Cauchy problem for the heat equation:
$$
   \left\{ \begin{array}{l} u_{t}   =  \frac{1}{2} u_{xx}, \;\;\; t>0, \; x \in \mathbb{R} \\
   u(0,x)  =  f(x), \;\;\; x \in \mathbb{R} \end{array} \right.
$$
Then $\frac{1}{t}(A(t)-A(0))f(x) = \frac{1}{t}(u(t,x)-u(0,x))$. So the question is equivalent to a question: is it true that for bounded $f(x) \in C^2(\mathbb{R})$ there exists a right derivative
$$
   \lim\limits_{t\to +0}\frac{u(t,x)-u(0,x)}{t} = u_{t}(+0,x) = \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}(0,x)
$$
so that the equation $u_t = \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}$ is valid for limit value of $t$.","['convolution', 'derivatives', 'partial-differential-equations']"
