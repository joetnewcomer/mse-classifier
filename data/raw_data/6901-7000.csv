51866,"Do there exist interesting binary relations satisfying reflexivity and symmetry, but not transitivity?","Given the usual set-theoretic definition of a binary relation[1], along with the usual notions of reflexivity symmetry transitivity Do there exist any interesting (i.e. surprising, yielding novel results, worth studying etc.) binary relations (across the various fields of study) satisfying reflexivity and symmetry , but not transitivity ? If so, could you provide a non-trivial[2] example? In my (limited) experience (< 1 year of undergraduate study) I've not come across an example satisfying this constraint, but I'm also relatively new to studying Mathematics. [1] A binary relation on sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as a subset of the cartesian product $A \times B$, that is, a collection of ordered pairs [2] A really simple example would be the relation over sets of people encoding had a conversation with . That is, we've all debated with ourselves granting reflexivity , and the symmetry is similarly obvious, while transitivity is not guaranteed.","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"
51869,Number of ways to sum square numbers to yield a given number,"I would like to know how many choices of $x_i$ there are such that $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2=m$$
where $n$, $m$ are given. The $x_i$ can be any nonnegative integer and need not be unique and the order is relevant. $k=\lfloor \sqrt{m} \rfloor$ is also given and may or may not be useful, I don't know. So basically I'm asking for the integer partition, but with square numbers instead of integers. The 'square partition', I presume? An example: $n = 3, m =4$ has $3$ solutions, namely $x_1$ = 2, $x_2 = x_3 = 0$ and $2$ permutations.
Another example $n = 4, m =4$ has $5$ solutions, namely $x_1$ = 2, $x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = 0$ and $3$ permutations and the solution $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = 1$. If no exact solution exists, does someone know how to approximate this when $1 << n$ and $1 << m$? Thank you","['integer-partitions', 'combinatorics']"
51885,What is the Cardinality of the Nameable Numbers?,"Having just finished ""Meta Math!"" (Chaitin), I came across an interesting observation on infinite sets that I hadn't seen before. If I'm correct (and please let me know if I'm not): 1] There are infinite sets that we are used to, like the whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers that, since they can be put in one-to-one correspondence with each other, have the same 'size' or cardinality, $\aleph_0$ 2] The real numbers can not be put in correspondence with these sets. They are in fact a power set of the smaller sets, $| \mathbb{R} | = 2^{\aleph_0}$. 3] If the continuum hypothesis holds we get that $| \mathbb{R} |=\aleph_1$, ie. there is no intermediate infinity in between the cardinality of the set of the whole numbers versus that of the reals. Now comes the part where I get a bit fuzzy. There are 'computable reals', numbers like $\pi$ that can be encoded in a finite length program. These computable reals must be of size $\aleph_0$ as well, since you can encode all of them with a Turing machince and match each code to an integer. There are uncomputable reals, such as Chaitin's $\Omega$ which, although we can't write down all the digits, we can at least specify what the number means . Chaitin calls these numbers 'nameable', let's call them $\mathbb{A}$. He asserts that the probability that you'll pick one at random is zero. This implies (I think) that $|\mathbb{A}|=\aleph_0$, but it also implies that there is a mapping of the integers to the uncomputable, yet namable numbers! What is the cardinality of numbers like $\Omega$?","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

51896,Why does it seem I can't apply the Radon transform to the Helmholtz equation?,"Say we a function $u$ and a bounded region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, such that $(\Delta+\lambda)u = 0$ everywhere, and $u=0$ on the boundary. We extend it to the entire plane by defining $u=0$ everywhere outside of $\Omega$. Wikipedia states that, for the Radon transform, $R\Delta = \partial^2 / \partial s^2 R$, hence we can derive the ODE $$ \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial s^2} + \lambda \right) Ru(\theta,s) = 0,$$ therefore we can reason that $$ Ru(\theta,s) = a(\theta) e^{i \sqrt{\lambda} s} + b(\theta) e^{-i \sqrt{\lambda} s}.$$ But this is periodic in $s$ with period $2\pi/\sqrt{\lambda}$, which would imply either that the above vanishes everywhere, or that it's possible to integrate $u$ over lines arbitrarily far away from $\Omega$ and still get a positive value, despite $u$ vanishing identically on said line. Contradiction. So does this mean: I can't use $R\Delta = \partial^2 / \partial s^2 R$ for functions that aren't sufficiently smooth, or The Radon transform is discontinuous at any line tangent to $\partial \Omega$?","['integral-transforms', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'analysis']"

51913,How does $\Delta f$ behave where $f$ has jump discontinuities in first-order partials?,"In the wake of a prior question , I've solidified my understanding that for a one-dimensional function $f(x)$, when its first derivative has a jump discontinuity of height $h$ at $x_0$, we can regard the second derivative (for the purpose of eventually integrating it) as having a $\delta(x-x_0)$ factor plus a locally continuous function. What if, as in my former question, a continuous function is nonzero everywhere outside of the bounded region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, and its first-order partials have jump discontinuities at the boundary: how then should we derive the form of $\Delta f$ ? My guess is that if we define $\nabla f$ on the boundary by taking the limit from inside $\Omega$, then we'll get something akin to $\Delta f = \delta(0) \| \nabla f \|$ on the boundary, and $0$ otherwise. Or is it possible that when integrating $\Delta f$ over a path hitting a single boundary point $x_0$, the resulting ""$\delta$-factor"" depends on what direction the path hits $x_0$?","['multivariable-calculus', 'analysis']"

51924,Is putting absolute values around the argument of a log obtained through integration incorrect?,"I've always been taught that when integrating a function of the form $f'(x)/f(x)$ to put an absolute value around the argument of the resulting logarithm. For example: $$\int\frac1{x}\mathrm dx = \log{|x|} + c$$ The reason provided was that 'logarithms aren't defined for negative numbers', it seems a bit like cheating to me to just throw absolute values around the argument. Furthermore, I thought of a case where this would actually produce the wrong result; $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1{x}\mathrm dx = \log|1| - \log|-1| = 0$$ However, the correct way should be this: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1{x}\mathrm dx = \log(1) - \log(-1) = 0 - i\pi = -i\pi$$ Edit: I may be wrong, but the integral above, ignoring the singularity (sorry couldn't think of a better example to illustrate my point with -1 and changing it now would make people's answers and comments seem off-topic), should be correct due to Euler's identity: $e^{i\pi} = -1 \implies \log(-1) = i\pi$ Could someone please provide a better explanation?

51967,An example of a projective sequence of measures on non-Borel spaces that does not extend to a probability on the product space?,"Daniell proved a theorem on the existence of random sequences (see page 13 of these notes ): Let $(S_n,\mathbf{S_n})$ be a sequence of Borel spaces and let $\mu_n$
  be a projective sequence of probability measures on $ (S_n:n\in
> \mathbb{N})$. Then, there's a unique probability measure $ \mathbb{P}$

  $\mathbb{P}[E\times \prod_{i\geq n+1}S_i] = \mathbb{P}[E]$ I'm trying to find a counterexample when we don't assume that $(S_n,\mathbf{S_n})$ are Borel. Perhaps the simplest examples of non-Borel spaces are finite measurable spaces for which not all singleton sets are measurable. Non-Borel sets are also non-Borel spaces, but this seems like a complicated way to go. (Quick, relevant question: are all probability measures on such spaces inner regular?) The main idea of the proof of this theorem seems to be that we can approximate measurable sets on $([0,1],\mathcal{B}[0,1])$ by compact sets, and use the fact that $(S_n:n\in \mathbb{N})$ have the same structure, since they are Borel. I still don't have a clear idea of which properties any counterexample must satisfy, which is probably why I haven't got very far! Thank you.",['probability-theory']
52017,Dual of the empty function [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Why is $|Y^{\emptyset}|=1$ but $|\emptyset^Y|=0$ where $Y\neq \emptyset$ Let $Y^X$ denote the set of all functions (i.e. relations , or ordered pairs ) having signature $X \rightarrow Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are arbitrary sets. Additionally, we should note that $Y^X$ is always a subset of $\wp({X \times Y})$. It can be shown that $Y^{\varnothing}$ contains only one element, namely $\varnothing$ (the empty function ). I would expect that similarly , $\varnothing^X$ would yield the same [1]. According to Halmos' book on Naive Set Theory this is not the case, and in fact, $\varnothing^X$ is empty—i.e. there exist no functions having signature $X \rightarrow \varnothing$. Question : Given that $Y^\varnothing$ contains the empty function, why do we not see the existence of a concept dual to the empty function in $\varnothing^X$? Or am I just being pedantic in my reading [2] and missing the point entirely? Essentially, I'm curious why we do not see a function having signature $$X \rightarrow \varnothing$$ [1] Both $\wp(\varnothing \times Y)$ and $\wp(X \times \varnothing)$ result in $\{\varnothing\}$, leaving us with both sets of functions in question being a subset of $\{\varnothing\}$. [2] A direct quote of what we're required to show: Exercise: (i) $Y^\varnothing$ has exactly one element, namely $\varnothing$, whether or not $Y$ is empty or not, and (ii) if $X$ is not empty, then $\varnothing^X$ is empty.","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
52021,Addition theorems for elliptic functions: is there a painless way?,"The Weierstrass $\wp$ function satisfies the addition formula $$\wp(z+Z)+\wp(z)+\wp(Z) = \left(\frac{\wp'(z)-\wp'(Z)}{\wp(z)-\wp(Z)}\right)^2.$$ Of course, this is just the $x$-coordinate of the sum of the points $(\wp'(z), \wp(z))$ and $(\wp'(Z), \wp(Z))$ on the Weierstrass elliptic curve $y^2=4x^3-g_2x-g_3$. If one has an a priori knowledge of this fact, the computation of the addition formula is absolutely trivial. However, it seems that, in the literature, there is no ""illuminating"" proof from first principles. Perhaps my standards for ""illuminating"" are too high, but in comparison with proofs of addition formulas for trigonometric functions, the addition formula for $\wp$ is painstaking to establish. I would like to know how the formula above, or an equivalent formula (perhaps for the Weierstrass $\sigma$-functions?) may be deduced in the most direct possible manner. Of course, a proof such as one that involves the comparison of power series around the origin is very direct, but it requires a first-hand knowledge of the formula, so it's not quite what I'm looking for.

$X_{(i)},i=1,2,3$ are the ordered values of the sample. I'm having trouble trying to solve this question since the median is for the distribution and not the sample.

52044,Necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ to have an $n$th root in $\mathbb{Z}[[t]]$,"Let $p(t) = \sum p_k t^k$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$, with $p_0=1$.  Is there a necessary and sufficient condition (congruence or other) on the coefficients $p_k$ such that $p(t)$ admits a square root in $\mathbb{Z}[[t]]$? More generally, is there a necessary and sufficient condition for $p(t)$ to have an $n$-th root in $\mathbb{Z}[[t]]$? Based on the fact that $(1+n^2z)^{1/n} \in \mathbb{Z}[[z]]$ for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we obtain a sufficient condition, namely that $n^2 \mid p_k$ for all $k>0$.  This is, however, very weak. Edit: Clarified notation as per one of the comments.  Also, a recent paper `On the Integrality of $n$th Roots of Generating Functions' by Heninger, Rains, and Sloane provides a criterion that may be of some use: ""Let $\mu_n = n \prod_{q \mid n} q$ where $q$ ranges over the primes dividing $n$.  Then $f= \sum u_n t^n \in \mathbb{Z}[[t]]$ admits an $n$th root in $\mathbb{Z}[[t]]$ if and only if $f \mod \mu_n$ does as well."" As such, we can hope to get lucky and have some reduction that is obviously an $n$th power (for example, if $f \mod \mu_n$ is the power of some polynomial , instead of just a power series.  Note of course that this does not resolve our original question. Edit II: This question has been untouched for a long while, but perhaps this will help another as a reference.  For completeness, I'd like to add that the condition that $p$ reduce modulo $\mu_n$ to the $n$th power of a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ is actually both sufficient and necessary for $p$ to admit an $n$th root in $\mathbb{Z}[[t]]$ (given, of course, that $p(0)=1$).  The proof relies on the following combinatorial lemma, that
$$\mu_n \mid (\mu_n/n)^k \binom{n}{k}$$
for $k=1,\ldots, n$.  One may then show that our $n$th roots of $p(t)$, say $\sum a_n t^n \in \mathbb{Z}[[t]]$, reduce to polynomials $\mod \mu_n/n$, by showing that $n a_n$ is eventually divisible by $(\mu_n/n)^k \binom{n}{k}$ for some $k$, through a symmetry/combinatorial argument.","['power-series', 'abstract-algebra']"

52054,Interchanging the order of limits of a particular double sequence,"I would like to interchange the iterated limits of a particular double sequence $a_{n,m}$, that is I would like that $\lim_{m\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n,m}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\lim_{m\to\infty}a_{n,m}$.
The sequence has the following properties. Firstly, it is actually formed by a sum over one of the variables of a double sequence $b_{n,i}$, so that $a_{n,m}=\sum_{i=1}^mb_{n,i}$, where $0\leq b_{n,i}\leq 1$. Hence for each fixed $n$, $a_{n,m}$ is an increasing sequence in $m$. For each fixed $n$ the limit $\lim_{m\to\infty}a_{n,m}=l_n$ exists, i.e. the series $\sum_{i=1}^\infty b_{n,i}$ converges. The iterated limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}\lim_{m\to\infty}a_{n,m}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^\infty b_{n,i}$ exists. For each fixed $m$ the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n,m}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^m b_{n,i}=\sum_{i=0}^m\lim_{n\to\infty}b_{n,i}=p_m$ exists. I know that if it were the case that $a_{n,m}\to l_n$ uniformly in $n$ then the double limit $\lim_{n,m\to\infty}a_{n,m}=a$ exists, and then since $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n,m}=p_m$ exists, the iterated limits would commute and equal $a$ (as in When can you switch the order of limits? ), but I don't have uniformity. So are the above properties sufficient for the the iterated limits to commute, or do I need something more?","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

$$ \frac{\sin y}{x} dx + (\frac{y}{x} \cos y - \frac{\sin y}{y} ) dy = 0 $$ The problem says to use to use an integrating factor $ u(x,y)=h(\frac{x}{y}) $. To make integrating a little easier I first did a variable change using $v=\frac{x}{y} $, but that didn't help much when I had to derive it. In general I-ve been having trouble solving most problems that require an integrating factor that involes both variables, unless it's of the form $ u(x,y)=x^a y^b $ with a and b integers to be determined. I think there's some ""simple"" way to solve this I'm not seeing, or knew and can't remember. If anyone has any idea, please share. Now on to the second problem. I need to find a solution for $$ y'' -y' +e^2x y = 0$$ As a note it says to consider the variable change $ x = \ln t$. By doing this I get  $ y'' - y' +t y = 0 $, which I'm not too sure how to solve. I gather that something's missing since as that is right now $y'= \frac{dy}{dx} $, and I need it w.r.t.  $t$. So, $$y'= \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dt} \frac{dt}{dx} = y' \frac{1}{t} $$ $$ y'' = \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = \frac{dy'}{dx} = \frac{dy'}{dt} \frac{dt}{dx} = y'' \frac{1}{t^2} $$ Putting all this together back in the equation I get $$ \frac{y''}{t^2} - \frac{y'}{t} + ty = 0 $$ Now All I can really think about this is adding everything together so $$\frac{y'' - ty' +t^3 y}{t^2} = 0 $$ $$ y'' - t y' + t^3 y = 0 $$ Again, I'm probably not doing something right here, but if I am, I'm not sure what would be a suitable $y(t)$ to try, since it can't be $t^a$, $e^{at}$ and so on. Again, any ideas would be more than welcomed. EDIT: Regarding the second problem, with a little help from Gerry I got (Assuming $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = t^2 \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} $ which I think is right) $$ t^2 y'' - t y' + ty = 0 $$ $$ ty'' - y' + y = 0 $$ Either $ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = t \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$ so that I don-t have any $t$ laying around, or there's something else that I'm not getting.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
52071,Geometric interpretation of a certain property of graded rings,"Let $k$ be a field, and $A$ a (commutative associative unital) $k$-algebra. It is known that there is a natural isomorphism between ‘regular’ (in the sense of regular maps of varieties) actions of $k^\times$ on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ and $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings of $A$: see here , for example. Now, suppose $k$ is algebraically closed and $A$ is finitely-generated and reduced, so that $\operatorname{Spec} A$ is an affine variety over $k$. Let $V = \operatorname{MaxSpec} A$ (and so a variety in the traditional sense), and suppose $M : V \times \mathbb{A}^1 \to V$ is a morphism of affine varieties and a multiplicative action of $k$, in the sense that $M$ satisfies the associativity condition $$M(M(p, a), a') = M(p, a a')$$ and the identity condition $$M(p, 1) = p$$ for all $p$ in $V$ and all $a$ and $a'$ in $k$, regarded as points of $\mathbb{A}^1$. If I'm not mistaken, this suffices to induce an $\mathbb{N}$-grading on $A$. Conversely, given an $\mathbb{N}$-grading on $A$ we may construct such a multiplicative action. I am interested in geometrical interpretations of properties of gradations this correspondence. For example, $M$ satisfies the absorption condition that there is a unique $\hat{p}$ in $V$ such that $$M(p, 0) = \hat{p}$$ for all $p$ in $V$ if and only if $A_0 \cong k$. Question 1 : What is the condition on the gradation which corresponds to $\hat{p}$ being the unique fixed point of $M$?

52077,Types of divergence,"My teacher said there are two main ways a sequence can diverge, it can increase in magnitude without bound, or it can fail to resolve to any one limit. But maybe that second kind of divergence is too diverse? There is a big difference between the divergent sequence 1, -1, 1, -1 . . . 
And the sequence formed by taking a digit from pi, g, then adding up the next g digits of pi and dividing that by g. (6/3, 25/5, 36/5, 11/2, 18/4, . . . ) Yet both of the above are more orderly than a sequence of random numbers. From what little I understand of randomness. So maybe we should say that we have: Sequences that increase in magnitude without bound. Sequences the can be decomposed in to convergent sub sequences, or in to sequences as in #1 Sequences based on a rule. Random sequences. Yet, a random sequence, with even distribution will have convergent sub sequences to every number in it's range...suddenly randomness seems orderly.

Let $\mathcal{X}\to S$ be a complete, regular, flat, connected $S$-scheme of finite type whose fibres are smooth, projective, geometrically connected algebraic curves.  Let $s \in S$ be the closed point, let $\xi \in S$ be the generic point, let $\mathcal{X}_s$ be the special fibre of $\mathcal{X}$, and let $X = \mathcal{X}_\xi$ be the generic fibre of $\mathcal{X}$. If $\mathscr{L}$ is an invertible sheaf on $\mathcal{X}$, then there are maps $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L})\to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}_\xi)$ and $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L})\to \Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$.  In the right circumstances (I think when $\mathscr{L}$ is generated by global sections; maybe we need projective normality?), these two maps induce surjections $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L}) \otimes_R k(\xi) \to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}_\xi)$ and $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L}) \otimes_R k(s) \to \Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$. My question involves going in the other direction: Suppose we are given $\mathscr{L}_s$ on $\mathcal{X}_s$ which is generated by global sections. Under what conditions, and how , can one find an invertible sheaf $\mathscr{L}$ on $\mathcal{X}$ such that $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L}) \otimes_R k(\xi) \to \Gamma(X, \mathcal{L}_\xi)$ and $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L}) \otimes_R k(s) \to \Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$ are surjective. ETA : Note that I am particularly interested in the ""and how"" part; which is to say that, given an (explicit) basis for $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$, how do I go about finding an (explicit) basis for $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{L})$ that satisfies the surjectivity properties above (assuming $\mathscr{L}$ exists)? My idea is to take a basis of $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$, lift it to an $R$-module $M$, and take the saturation $\operatorname{Sat}(M) = R^n \cap (M \otimes_R k(\xi))$ where $n = \dim\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$.  Some related ""sub-questions"" based on this idea: Suppose $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$ is generated by global sections $\{\bar{s}_0, \ldots, \bar{s}_r\}$ and let $M$ be the $R$-module generated by lifts $\{s_0, \ldots, s_r\}$ of the $\bar{s}_i$.  Let $\mathscr{M} = \widetilde{M}$ be the sheaf associated to $M$.  Then $M = \Gamma(\mathcal{X}, \mathscr{M}) \to \Gamma(\mathcal{X}_s, \mathscr{L}_s)$ is surjective.  Under what conditions is $\mathscr{M}$ invertible? Is this $\mathscr{M}$ isomorphic to $\pi_*\mathscr{L}_s$, where $\pi\colon\mathcal{X}_s \to \mathcal{X}$ is the canonical ""projection""? N.B. The conditions I listed in the first paragraph describe the (rather restrictive) situation I'm interested in; I would certainly be interested in hearing answers valid in a more general context.

This then made me realize that if $f$ and $g$ are examples, then so is the function $h$ defined by $h(0)=0$, $h(z)=f(z)/g(z)$ if $z\neq 0$.  So there are examples I did not include above.

52345,Proof for the projection of vector u on v,"I was trying to prove that $proj_v(u)=\frac{v·u}{||v||^2}$ v , and I was getting close, but then a friend spoiled the fun of completing the proof by giving me what he called a ""hint"". Blurting out a key part in a proof isn't a ""hint"". Needless to say, after this, I immediately knew what to do to complete the proof, but as I looked back at my original approach, I can't help but wonder what was wrong with it. I tried it, but with it I got answers like the zero vector or even an infinite number of answers, and I don't know why. What I did was I defined the projection of u onto v to be the vector x such that ( u - x )· v =0 (because of the orthogonality). If I break these vectors down into their component forms, with the components of x $\langle$ x$_1$, x$_2\rangle$ being treated as variables, (and the components of u and v as constants) then we get an infinite number of answers, since we have 2 variables.

52350,"Finite Groups with exactly $n$ conjugacy classes $(n=2,3,...)$","I am looking to classify (up to isomorphism) those finite groups $G$ with exactly 2 conjugacy classes. If $G$ is abelian, then each element forms its own conjugacy class, so only the cyclic group of order 2 works here. If $G$ is not abelian, I am less sure what is going on.  The center $Z(G)$ is trivial since each of it's elements also form their own conjugacy class.  Now assume $G-\{1_G\}$ is the other conjugacy class. The Class Equation says $|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum [G:C_G(x)]$ where the sum is taken over representatives from the conjugacy classes (not counting the singleton ones from the center).  (Here $C_G(x)=\{g\in G~|~gx=xg\}$ is the centralizer of $x$ in $G$.) For us this simplifies to $|G|-1=[G:C_G(x)]$ for any $x\in G-\{1_G\}$.  Therefore $|C_G(x)|=\frac{|G|}{|G|-1}$ is an integer.  But this can only happen when $|G|=2$ which we have already covered.  So does this mean up to isomorphism there is only one group with 2 conjugacy classes?

52708,probability that point is within triangle formed by three lines of bearing,"This is a basic probability problem, and I can get the solution. But for a while I was using a wrong approach. My question for the forum is why my initial approach was wrong. The problem: You're on a ship sailing off a coast in a 2-dimensional world, and to fix your position you take three lines of bearing. Each of the three readings is independent and has independent errors. Errors are symmetrical for each bearing, i.e. you're equally likely to get a bearing which is too high as a bearing which is too low. The three observed lines of bearing will form a triangle. What is the probability of your ship being inside the triangle. The solution: The probability is 25%. To see this, consider each line of bearing as having equal probability of being too high or too low. You therefore have eight error possibilities: +++, ++-, +-+, etc. If you draw out all eight, you'll see that in two of them the ship is in the triangle formed. Hence, 25%. My original, incorrect approach: I drew out three observed lines of bearing, and considered the possibility that the ship was in the triangle formed. However, the three lines divide the plane into only seven areas. In this approach, I considered the probability that the ship was ""above"" or ""below"" a given line of bearing as 50%. (As opposed to the correct approach, where the probability that an observed line was ""above"" or ""below"" the correct position of the ship was 50%.) But, like I said, the ship has only seven (not eight) possible combinations of ""above"" and ""below"" for the three lines of bearing -- one of those eight combinations is a geometrical impossibility. So this line of reasoning was not fruitful, and I couldn't get anywhere until I thought the correct way. My question for the forum: Why was my original approach wrong? I'm thinking it has something to do with considering the position of the ship as the random variable rather than the errors of each bearing line as random variables. Or else, in drawing three bearing lines, I'm already excluding some probabilities (i.e. making a choice)?

52723,How to show that a limit vanishes,"Let $1<p<\infty$, $f \in L^p([0,\infty))$. Why is it then true that
$$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x^{1-\frac{1}{p}}} \left( \int_0^x f(t)dt\right) =0?$$ I know that from Hölder's inequality, we can get that $||f||_{L^1([0,\infty))} \leq ||f||_{L^p([0,\infty))} x^{1-\frac{1}{p}}, \; \forall x >0$, and I also think that this inequality must be strict, since equality would imply that $f$ is constant, which would contradict the fact that $f \in L^p$ on a domain with infinite measure. That's only a necessary condition though, and I'm not really sure how to proceed any further.",['real-analysis']

$$
\mathbf x^T \mathbf A\mathbf x + \mathbf x^T \mathbf b + c = 0.

52737,Estimating an integral,"This question is a more specific question related to https://mathoverflow.net/questions/69900/asymptotics-for-the-number-of-ways-to-sum-primes-such-that-the-sum-is-n I am looking for a lower bound (that is tight as possible) for the integral $\int_{2}^n e^{\sqrt{x/\log{x}}} dx.$ Unfortunatelly, $e^{\sqrt{x/\log{x}}}$ is not integrable, so one has to bound it first and then evalute the integral of the bounded function.  For example $$\int_{2}^n e^{\sqrt{x/\log{x}}} \geq \int_{2}^n e^\sqrt[3]{x} dx = O(n^{\frac{2}{3}}e^{\sqrt[3]{n}}) $$ The bound obtained above is inferior to $e^{\sqrt{n/\log{n}}}$, so I should either find a better bound for the integrated function, or perhaps use another (unknown to me) trick to bound the stated integral. Any suggestions are appreciated!","['inequality', 'integration']"

52768,Proof of Moisezon Theorem,"We call a compact complex manifold Moisezon manifold, if its dimension coincides with the algebraic dimension, i.e. it has as many algebraically independent meromorphical functions as its complex dimension.
Boris Moisezon himself gave a proof to the following theorem:
Let $X$ be a Moisezon mainfold, then for $X$ to be projective it is necessary and sufficient to be Kähler. It was told that it could also be formulated as a criterion for projectivity: A compact complex manifold is projective if and only if it is kähler and moisezon. I didn't find any complete proof to the second formulation. Does someone know where to find it? Or at least how it works? Edit: I already found two versions for the implication ""projective=>moisezon"" (necessity to be kähler is in fact clear), but i am also interested in alternatives, especially for the other one. On the one hand Huybrechts, Complex Geometry and on the other hand Wells, Moisezon spaces and the kodaira embeddingtheorem. Next Edit: I don't want this to look like a jeaopardy question but, after postponing the problem I stumbled upon this: There is a different proof by Thomas Peternell, given in ""Algebraicity Criteria for Compact Complex Manifolds"", Math. Ann. 275, 653-672 (1986). Theorem 1.4. states a slight variation of the theorem of Moisezon which is indeed equivalent. More precisely it states, that if there exist a real $(1,1)$-form $\omega$ and a real $2$-form $\varphi$ on a Moisezon manifold $X$ such that $\omega$ is positive definite, $d(\omega-\varphi) = 0$ and $\int_C \varphi = 0$ for all curves $C\subset X$, then $X$ is projective.","['kahler-manifolds', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry', 'reference-request']"
52772,Derived analytic function from real part,"I saw Ahlfors's book Complex Analysis . It mentioned that analytic function $f(z)$ can be derived from a given real part $u(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are real. It said that
$$
u(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}[f(x+iy)+\bar{f}(x-iy)].     \tag{1}
$$ However, it mentioned that it is 'reasonable' that (1) holds even when $x$ and $y$ are 'complex'. Why? I think that, if $x$ and $y$ are real, then real part $u(x,y)$ should be written down by
$$
u(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}[f(z)+\bar{f}(\bar{z})], \tag{2}
$$
where $z=x+iy$. Hence, if $x$ and $y$ are complex, (2) should be equal to
$$
u(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}[f(x+iy)+\bar{f}(\bar{x}-i\bar{y})]. \tag{3}
$$
It confused me for a long time. Please help me. Thanks!",['complex-analysis']
