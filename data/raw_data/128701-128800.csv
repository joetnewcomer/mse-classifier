1980363,Confusion Regarding the Quotient Set,"Supposing I have a set $A$ and binary relation $R$ such that $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ $R = \{(1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,5), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5)\}$ I want to find the quotient set $A/R$ , but I'm not totally sure I understood my professor's explanation of how to do so. From what I gathered, the quotient set is the set of all equivalence classes of $A$ under the relation $R$ . Then if $R$ is an equivalence relation, the equivalence class of some element $a$ belonging to $A$ is the set of all elements related to $a$ . In that case, would the quotient set of $A$ and $R$ be $$A/R = \{\{1,3,4\}, \{2,5\}\}$$ Or would I have to include binary pairs in the quotient set, i.e. $A/R = \{\{(1,1), (1,3) ... \}\}$ since the elements of $R$ are binary pairs?","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1980380,Approximating Volumes in high dimensions using Monte Carlo,"I am interested in approximating the volume of a subset $S$ of a hypercube in $d$ dimensions through Monte Carlo. The idea would then be that I have a large number of uniformly distributed samples in the hypercube and find the proportion of samples that lie in $S$. My question is then: suppose that I use 10000 samples in $[0,1]^2$ to approximate the volume of $S_1 \in [0,1]^2$. Would I get the same level of accuracy if I were to use 10000 samples in $[0,1]^3$ to approximate the volume of $S_2 \in [0,1]^3$? I'm asking because intuitively, as I increase the dimension, it seems to me that more samples in the hypercube are needed to ""fill in the space."" But if you think of it in numbers, computing the density of samples in both cases, it turns out that they're the same since the volume of both hypercubes is 1, regardless of the dimension. Am I thinking about it from the wrong perspective? Should more samples be used in higher dimensions?","['volume', 'monte-carlo', 'numerical-methods', 'geometry']"
1980390,"At what value on the interval $(0, 3\pi/2)$ does $f(x) = \int_{x}^{2x} \frac{\sin(t)}{t} \, dt $ attain a local maximum?","I had a question in regards to the following question I encountered on a GRE practice exam. The question is as follows: The following function is defined for all positive $x$: $$f(x) = \int_{x}^{2x} \frac{\sin(t)}{t} \, dt $$ At what value on the interval $(0, 3\pi/2)$ does the function attain a local maximum? 
  A.) $\pi/6$ B.) $\pi/3$ C.) $\pi/2$ D.) $\pi$ E.) $2\pi/3$ I arrived at the correct answer B, but did it slightly differently than the solution manual did and wanted some clarification. So I calculated $$f'(x) = \frac{\sin(2x) - \sin(x)}{x},$$ set the numerator equal to 0 (since the denominator being equal to zero is outside the domain) and arrived at $\sin(2x) = \sin(x)$. At this point I ruled out A, C, and E since $\sin(2x) \neq \sin(x)$ for those $x$-values and then computed the second derivative and determined that $f''(\pi/3) < 0$ and $f''(\pi)>0$; so the answer is B. The solution manual used a trig identity I did not know off the top of my head and said that $\sin(2x) - \sin(x) = 0$ implies that $\sin(x)(2 \cos(x) - 1) = 0$ and so $\sin(x) = 0$ or $\cos(x) = 1/2$, which implies that $x = \pi/3$ because $0 < x < 3\pi/2$. Why were they able to rule out the solution $x = \pi$ since after all $\sin(\pi) = 0$ and $0 < \pi < 3\pi/2$?","['maxima-minima', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'calculus']"

1980565,Can we model finite propagation speeds through parabolic PDEs?,"In physics, phenomena involving a finite propagation speed are typically expressed through hyperbolic (second-order) partial differential equations, such as, for instance, the well-known wave equation $$f_{tt}=c^2\nabla^2f$$ where $c$ is the wave propagation speed. What I'm interested to know is, could we find a parabolic PDE that models this kind of finite velocity limits, or are we automatically being thrown back to second-order equations? Is there a general mathematical theorem at play here about the solutions of parabolic vs hyperbolic PDEs? (This question is a follow-up to this one , which I posted some months ago in Physics SE, and I consider wasn't fully answered by that time).","['physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
1980570,How to translate this property of the Veronese embedding to the language of schemes?,"Exercise 2.18 in Hartshorne (chapter I) is: Let $C \subset \Bbb P^2$ be a closed curve (a variety of dimension 1). Then there exists a hypersurface $H \subset \Bbb P^5$ such that $\nu_2 (C)=H \cap \nu _2 (\Bbb P^2)$. This can be proved by writing $C=\Bbb V(f)$ for $f \in k[x_0,x_1,x_2]$ an homogeneous polynomial, noting $\Bbb V(f)=\Bbb V(f^2)$ and $f^2$ can be seen as a polynomial $g$ in the six variables $x_0^2,x_0x_1,...,x_2^2$, so taking $H=\Bbb V(g)$ works. What is the analogous statement in the category of schemes ? Does it hold? My try: To reformulate the claim in a scheme setting, we take: $\nu_2 (\Bbb P^2)=\operatorname{Proj} \bigoplus \limits_{d=0}^\infty k[x_0,x_1,x_2]_{2d} = \operatorname{Proj} \frac{k[y_0,...,y_5]}{(y_0y_3-y_1^2,y_0y_4-y_1y_2,y_0y_5-y_2^2,y_1y_4-y_2y_3,y_1y_5-y_2y_4,y_3y_5-y_4^2)}$. $H=\operatorname{Proj} \frac{k[y_0,...,y_5]}{(g)}$, for some homogeneous polynomial $g \in k[y_0,...,y_5]$. And the intersection of these two corresponds to the sum of the ideals by which we divide. $\nu _2 (C)$ may be replaced by a closed subscheme of dimension 1 of $\nu_2 (\Bbb P^2)$, and a closed subscheme of $\operatorname{Proj} S$ is always of the form $\operatorname{Proj} S/I$. There are two other approaches that seem possible, though:
it might be realized as $\operatorname{Proj} \bigoplus \limits_{d=0}^\infty \frac{k[x_0,x_1,x_2]_{2d}}{(f)_{2d}}$ for some $f$, or as $\operatorname{Proj} \frac{k[y_0,...,y_5]}{I(\nu_2(C))}$ where $\nu_2(C)$ is the familiar veronese embedding of a variety. I'm not sure what are the differences between these 3 approaches, so any of them is interesting. Taking it all together, the question looks unwieldy: Is there a scheme $D=\operatorname{Proj} \frac{k[y_0,...,y_5]}{I+(f,y_0y_3-y_1^2,y_0y_4-y_1y_2,y_0y_5-y_2^2,y_1y_4-y_2y_3,y_1y_5-y_2y_4,y_3y_5-y_4^2)}$ with dimension 1 such that there is no $g$ with $$D=\operatorname{Proj} \frac{k[y_0,...,y_5]}{(g,y_0y_3-y_1^2,y_0y_4-y_1y_2,y_0y_5-y_2^2,y_1y_4-y_2y_3,y_1y_5-y_2y_4,y_3y_5-y_4^2)} $$? I don't know if the considerations in this generalization are true or if there is a simpler way of looking at things.
A drawback of this method is that with it it's unclear even what corresponds to the choice of $C=\{x_0=0\} \subset \Bbb P^2$, to try a concrete simple case. The proof for varieties uses $\Bbb V(f)=\Bbb V(f^2)$ which does not hold for schemes, since $\operatorname{Proj} \frac {k[x_0,...,x_n]}{(f)} \neq \operatorname{Proj} \frac {k[x_0,...,x_n]}{(f^2)}$. Thus I expect a counterexample.","['schemes', 'projective-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1980572,"Find the absolute minimum of the function $ f(x,y) = x^2+y^2 $ subject to the constraint $x^2+ 2y^2 = 1 $.","I tried this question on a site and found that none of the answers were the ones I got. I think my calculations were right but my understanding of applying the correct theorems may have been off. I found the derivatives with respect to x and y and got: $f_x = 2x \quad$   $f_{xx} = 2 \quad $ $ f_{y} = 2y \quad $ $ f_{yy}=2 \quad $ $ f_{xy} = 0 $ The critical values are when $ 2x = 2y $ which is the line x = y. the fancy formula: $ D = f_{xx}*f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 $ gives us  $D = 4$ always. So long as the point is a critical point, its a relative min. Since it is subject to the constraint, we need the values which satisfy   $x^2+ 2y^2 = 1 $. Those are ones where $ x=y$ so we look at $x^2+ 2x^2 = 1 \implies 3x^2= 1 \implies x = \pm1/\sqrt{3}$. Either works so when I plug it in to the original function, since $ x=y$, I get $ 2/3 $. Thus my absolute minimum. Is my reasoning correct? or am I missing tools or using the tools incorrectly from multivariable Calculus?","['multivariable-calculus', 'maxima-minima']"

1980881,The Category of Groups and Conjugacy Classes of Homomorphisms,"Algebraic topology begins with the observation that we can put an equivalence relation on the set of maps between two given spaces, namely homotopy. Studying this category of topological spaces and maps modulo this equivalence relation has been fruitful to say the least. Given two groups $G$ and $H$, we can similarly put an equivalence relation on $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{Grp}}(G,H)$ by declaring $\alpha,\beta:G \to H$ to be equivalent if there is some $h\in H$ such that $h\cdot \alpha(g) \cdot h^{-1} = \beta(g)$ for all $g \in G$. In other words, two group homomorphisms are declared to be equivalent if they differ by an inner automorphism. My question is whether or not it is also fruitful to study the category of groups and group homomorphisms modulo this equivalence relation. Immediately, it is clear that many of the things we talk about in introductory algebra (e.g. conjugacy classes, the class formula, normal subgroups) can be described using this category, so perhaps the study of this category would simply produce the same results. But perhaps not. In particular, I have the gut feeling that some results may be stated more cleanly, though I am not sure. Edit 10/23/2016 Some observations: let's call the category in question $\mathcal{C}$.

1981248,"Why is the arbitrary sum, but not the arbitrary intersection, of ideals an ideal?","Two Questions: What is the definition of an arbitrary sum of ideals? (I.e. arbitrarily infinitely many) Why is the arbitrary sum of ideals an ideal, but not the arbitrary intersection of ideals? My progress so far: My textbook doesn't have a definition, and I haven't been able to find the definition using Google so far. I have two guesses (i) it is the set of all infinite sums, or (ii) the same as the previous except with the additional condition that cofinitely many summands in each sum be equal to zero. The former seems like the ""natural"" extension of the definition of sum to an arbitrary index set of ideals, but the latter seems like the ""convenient"" definition, and I'm not sure which goal (naturalness or convenience) should take priority. I would expect that the arbitrary intersection of ideals is an ideal, because the ideal generated by any set is the arbitrary intersection of all ideals containing that set, and the radical of an ideal is the arbitrary intersection of all prime ideals containing the ideal. Meanwhile, it isn't clear to me that the infinite sum of elements of a ring should even be defined. Usually one has that the product of ideals is included in the intersection, and that usually only the finite product of ideals is an ideal, so in the exceptional cases where the product of ideals equals the intersection of ideals, I can somewhat see how the intersection wouldn't be an ideal. But there are at least two problems with this: if only the finite product of ideals is an ideal, then why isn't the same true for sums of ideals? Why is the multiplication operation in the ring being given a privileged position compared to the addition operation? Second, if the product of ideals equals the intersection of ideals in a certain ring, then why doesn't that just allow one to define arbitrary products of ideals, instead of making it impossible to define anything besides finite intersections of ideals? It seems clear to me that I am fundamentally misunderstanding some aspect of the operations (addition, multiplication, intersections) of ideals. EDIT: http://planetmath.org/sumofideals Planetmath says that ""the sum of ideals is the smallest ideal of the ring containing all of those ideals"". So I guess my question could be thought of as -- why isn't the intersection of ideals the smallest ideal of the ring containing all of those ideals? For every other object I know of which is closed under intersections, it is the intersection which has this property. Do the sum and intersection coincide in some sense? Note: This question is so I can show that the Zariski topology on Spec(R) for a commutative ring with unit is a topology -- I have already shown that finite unions and intersections of Zariski closed sets are Zariski closed, see here , so now the question is how to proceed to the general case. In the finite case, the union of Zariski closed sets corresponds to the intersection of ideals, while the intersection of Zariski closed sets corresponds to the sum of ideals. I would expect the intersection of ideals to be arbitrarily extensible, and the sums to be only finitely defined, but that would make the Zariski closed sets the open sets of a topology, which is clearly incorrect.","['definition', 'abstract-algebra', 'ideals', 'commutative-algebra']"

1981524,Theorem 3.55 in Baby Rudin: How to make sense of the proof?,"Here's Theorem 3.55 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition. If $\sum a_n$ is a series of complex numbers which converges absolutely, then every rearrangement of $\sum a_n$ converges, and they all converge to the same sum. Now here's Rudin's proof. Let $\sum a_n^\prime$ be a rearrangement, with partial sums $s_n^\prime$. Given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $m \geq n \geq N$ implies $$ \sum_{i =n}^m \left\vert a_i \right\vert \leq \varepsilon.$$ [This relation Rudin calls (26). ] Now choose $p$ such that the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ are all contained in the set $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_p$ (we use the notation of Definition 3.52). Then if $n > p$, the numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_N$ will cancel in the difference $s_n - s_n^\prime$, so that $\left\vert s_n - s_n^\prime \right\vert \leq \varepsilon$, by (26). Hence $\left\{ s_n^\prime \right\}$ converges to the same sum as $\left\{ s_n \right\}$. And, finally, here's Rudin's Definition 3.52. Let $\left\{ k_n \right\}$, $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, be a sequence in which every positive integer appears once and only once (that is, $\left\{ k_n \right\}$ is a 1-1 function from $J$ onto $J$, in the notation of Definition 2.2). Putting $$ a_n^\prime = a_n \ \ \ (n= 1, 2, 3, \ldots),$$ 
  we say that $\sum a_n^\prime$ is a rearrangement of $\sum a_n$. And, for the sake of completeness, Rudin uses the symbol $J$ to denote the set of natural numbers. Now my question is, how does Rudin's relation (26) give the conclusion that $\left\vert s_n - s_n^\prime \right\vert \leq \varepsilon$ if $n > p$? Here's how I have been able to understand the proof. Given that $\sum \left\vert a_n \right\vert$ converges, we can conclude that $\sum a_n$ converges too. Let 
  $$s = \sum_{n =1 }^\infty a_n.$$
  Let $s_n$, $(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)$, be the partial sums of $\sum a_n$. Then $$s = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n.$$
  Now let $\sum a_n^\prime$ be a rearrangement of $\sum a_n$, and let $s_n^\prime$, $(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)$, be the partial sums of $\sum a_n^\prime$. We show that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n^\prime = s$$ as well. Now as $s_n \to s$ as $n \to \infty$, so, given $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N_1$ such that $$ \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > N_1$. Now as $\sum \left\vert a_n \right\vert$ converges, so we can find a natural number $N_2$ such that $$ \sum_{i =n}^m \left\vert a_i \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m \geq n \geq N_2$. So we can conclude that $$\left\vert \sum_{i=n}^m a_i \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m \geq n \geq N_2$. Now let $N = \max \left\{ N_1, N_2 \right\}$. Then, for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m \geq n > N$, we have $$ \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ and also $$\left\vert \sum_{i=n}^m a_i \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.$$ Now let $p$ be a natural number such that the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ are all contained in the set $\left\{ k_1, \ldots, k_p \right\}$. Then, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > p$, we see that the difference $s_n - s_n^\prime$ is a sum of some finitely many terms of the sequence $\left(  a_{N+1}, a_{N+2}, a_{N+3}, \ldots\right)$, and therefore $$\left\vert s_n - s_n^\prime \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. $$ So if $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is such that $n > \max \{ N, p \}$, then we have $$ \left\vert s_n - s_n^\prime \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ and also $$\left\vert s_n - s \right\vert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.$$ Therefore, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > \max \{ N, p \}$, we have 
  $$ \left\vert s_n^\prime - s \right\vert \leq \left\vert s_n^\prime - s_n \right\vert + \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert < \varepsilon,$$ from which it follows that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n^\prime = s$$ also. Is my understanding of the proof of Theorem 3.55 in Baby Rudin correct? If so, then is my version the same as Rudin's? If not, where have I erred? And, if my proof is also correct but differs from Rudin's, can anybody here please fill in the details in Rudin's original proof for me?

My proof: since $I(x)$ is the first integral, then $\dot{I}(x) = 0$. Since $\bar{x}$ is the nondegenerate minimum of $I(x)$, we have $I(x) > I(\bar{x})$ for all $x \neq \bar{x}$, in a neighbourhood of $\bar{x}$. Define $\tilde{I}(x) = I(x) - I(\bar{x})$. Then $\tilde{I}(\bar{x}) = 0$ and $\tilde{I}(x) >0$ for $x \neq \bar{x}$, in an neighbourhood of $\bar{x}$.

While the rest of the details of the proof aren't important for my question, the short version of the proof is that if $\theta$ is a rational angle then $2 \cos(\theta)$ is an algebraic integer. My gap in understanding has to do with proving something is an algebraic integer.  Suppose $2 \cos(\theta) = \sqrt{2} - (1/2)$.  If I start out with $x = \sqrt{2} - (1/2)$ and manipulate it to eliminate the $\sqrt{2}$, I wind up with $4x^2 +4x - 7 = 0$.  This also happens to be the same polynomial that Wolfram Alpha tells me is the minimal polynomial for $\sqrt{2} - (1/2)$. Now I look at $4x^2 +4x - 7$ and see the leading $4$ and conclude that it isn't monic so $\sqrt{2} - (1/2)$ isn't an algebraic integer. But when I check Wikipedia and many other sources I see the definition of the minimal polynomial is: The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is the monic polynomial of least degree among all polynomials in $F[x]$ having $\alpha$ as a root This seems to imply that for any value $\alpha$ you can find a monic polynomial.

Why do I (and Wolfram Alpha) not get a monic minimum polynomial and why does the minimum polynomial definition seem to suggest I should.  Is the difference really just polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ versus $\mathbb{Z}$ or is there something more subtle going on here?

1982680,Why is rank $uv^{T}$ always equal to 1? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to prove whether a matrix has rank $1$ (3 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Let $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $u,v \neq 0$. Since $u$ is an $m\times1$ matrix and $v^T$ is a $1\times n$ matrix, the product $uv^{T}$  is a $m\times n$ matrix. Then: $$\text{rank} (uv^{T}) =1$$ Just to illustrate: pick a random vector $u$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and $v$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$, for example: $u= (1, 2, 3, 4),$ and $v= (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$. The rank of the matrix $m\times n$ is $1$ which can be checked by row-reducing. Chosing arbitrary vectors $u,v \neq 0$, the rank of the product matrix mxn of $uv^{T}$ is always $1$. Why is this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['matrices', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"

1982696,Equation of a circle tangent which makes a triangle of area $a^2$ with the coordinate axes,What is the equation of the tangent to the circle $x^2+y^2-2ax-2ay+a^2=0$ which makes with the coordinate axes a triangle with area $a^2$? Attempt: The equation of the circle can be re-written as $(x-a)^2+(y-a)^2=a^2$. Let's say the tangent equation is $\frac{x}{c}+\frac{y}{d}=1$. From the condition that it is a tangent I get $|\frac{\frac{a}{c}+\frac{a}{d}-1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{c^2}+\frac{1}{d^2}}}|=a$. Simplifying I get $a(c+d-\sqrt{c^2+d^2})=cd$ and the area condition gives $\frac{1}{2}cd=a^2$. But I am not able to solve this two equation and get values of $c$ and $d$.,"['analytic-geometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"

In how many different ways can boys and girls sit a desks such that at each desk only one girl and one boy sits? I have a solution, but I have a little doubt that it is incomplete. So my solution is as follows: My worked solution: For the first desk  we can choose one girl by $\binom n1$ and one boy by $\binom n1$ and we can permute them by $2!$ ways. In result we have $2!\binom n1 \binom n1$. In the same way, we can work out for the second desk $2!\binom {n-1}1 \binom {n-1}1$ and so on. For the $nth$ desk we have $2!\binom {1}1 \binom {1}1$ ways. $Total = 2!\binom n1 \binom n1 2!\binom {n-1}1 \binom {n-1}1 ... 2!\binom {1}1 \binom {1}1 = 2^n(n!)^2$","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

My idea: $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = \frac{2xy(x^4+y^2)-4x^3(x^2y)}{(x^4+y^2)^2}$ $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} = \frac{x^2(x^4+y^2)-2y(x^2y)}{(x^4+y^2)^2}$ and neither of the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}$ , $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}$ exist at $f(0,0)$, so by definition  they are not differentiable this point.

Define $\mu(A)=0$ if $A$ is countable and $\mu(A)=1$ if $A$ is uncountable. Prove that $A$ is a measure. I think the statement of the problem is flawed, as it seems $\mu$ isn't even finitely additive. Indeed, if $A$ and $B$ are both uncountable disjoint elements of $\mathcal A$, then $A\cup B$ is not countable, hence $\mu(A \cup B) = 1$, but $\mu(A)+ \mu(B) = 1+1=2$...

1983163,Prove the direct sum of generalized eigenspaces is the whole vector space,"Given a $n\times n$ matrix $A$ over an algebraically closed field, let $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_k$ be its eigenvalues, and let $V_{\lambda_i}$ be the generalized eigenspace of $\lambda_i$. The question is to prove $⨁_{i=1}^dV_{λ_i }=V $. The generalized eigenspace is defined as the following, $V_{\lambda_i}=\{x:(A-\lambda_i I)^{m(\lambda_i)}x=0\}$ where $m(\lambda_i)$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda_i$. A proof from the textbook is as the following, Let $d_i$ = $\dim V_{\lambda_i}. $Suppose $⨁_{i=1}^dV_{λ_i }\neq V $, then $\sum_{i=1}^k d_i<n$. Let $S_i$ be a basis of $V_{λ_i }$ containing $d_i$ linear independent vectors, and extend $(S_1,...,S_k)$ to a basis of $V$ by adding $(n-\sum_{i=1}^k d_i<n)$ linear independent vectors $S'$, then $S=(S_1,...,S_k,S')$ is a basis of $V$. Note generalized eigenspaces are invariant subspaces, i.e. $AV_{\lambda_i}\subseteq V_{\lambda_i}$, thus every column of $AS_i$ 
  is still in $V_{\lambda_i}$ and hence a linear combination of columns of $S_i$ for $1\le i\le k$, thus the following holds (NOTE the ""*""s could be non-zero elements), where $AS_i=SA_i$ for $i=1,...,k$ Then I get lost with the proof. The remaining part is the following, I get the idea that the proof wants to find an eigenvector $x$ s.t. $Sx$ is a linear combination of only vectors in $S'$, then show $Sx$ is an eigenvector of some eigenvalue $\lambda_i$, and hence the contradiction because $Sx$ would be a vector in $V_{\lambda_i}$ that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $S_i$.
