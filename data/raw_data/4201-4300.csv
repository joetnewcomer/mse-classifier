30745,Solving a real cubic using trigonometric methods,"The problem is to figure out how to solve a real cubic equation of the form $x^3 + px + q = 0$ using trigonometry. The first step is to prove the identity $$
    4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta - \cos 3\theta = 0
$$ I can do this using de Moivre's formula as per the hint provided. I just equate the real parts of the expression for $\left(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta\right)^3$ with $\cos 3\theta$, replace $\sin^2 \theta$ with $1 - \cos^2 \theta$ and everything cancels out. The next step is to set $y = ax$ in  $x^3 + px + q = 0$ and show that there is a value of $a$ for which the equation then becomes $4y^3 - 3y - q_1 = 0$. I'm not sure exactly how to go about doing this. It seems like the only sensible thing to do is solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ to get $x = y/a$ and then plug that into the original equation. Doing so yields $$
 \left(\frac{y}{a}\right)^3 + p\frac{y}{a} + q = \frac{1}{a^3}y^3 + \frac{p}{a}y + q = 0.
$$ We can see then that $a$ must satisfy $a = 4^{-1/3}$ and $a = -p/3$. This uniquely determines $p$ as $p = -3/4^{1/3}$ so I know that this can't be the right thing to do. What does it mean to set $y = ax$?","['algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'cubics', 'polynomials', 'trigonometry']"

30750,Approximations Involving Exponential Functions,"I am reading a text and I am curious to know how certain approximations were reached. The first function approximations is: $$ 1- \frac{1}{2p}((1+p)e^{\frac{-y}{x(1+p)}} - (1-p)e^{\frac{-y}{x(1-p)}}) \approx \frac{y^2}{2x^2 (1-p^2)}$$ ,when $y \ll x$. Note that I tried using the approximation $e^x \approx 1+x$, when x is small, but all I got was the conclusion that $1- \frac{1}{2p}((1+p)e^{\frac{-y}{x(1+p)}} - (1-p)e^{\frac{-y}{x(1-p)}}) \approx 0$. The second function approximation is: $$ 1-e^{\frac{-y}{x}}(1-Q(a,b)+Q(b,a)) \approx \frac{y^2}{x^2 (1-p^2)}$$ ,when $y \ll x$, where $Q(a,b) = \int_b^\infty e^{-\frac12 (a^2 + u^2)} I_0(au) u \, du$, $b = \sqrt{\frac{2y}{x(1-p^2)}}$, $a = bp$, $I_0$ is a modified Bessel Function of the first kind.
It is also a known fact that $$ Q(b,0) = 1$$ and $$ Q(0,b) = e^{-\frac{b^2}{2}}$$ I have tried to assume $$ a = 0$$, since $a = bp$  and $b$ is small, $ p$ is a number between 0 and 1. However, it is not clear how $(1-p^2)$ is in the denominator and not $(1-p^2)^2 $, which would be closer to the traditional $e^x$ approximation. Any hints on how these approximations were derived would be appreciated. Thanks.","['approximation', 'calculus']"
30759,"Alternative name for ""closed set""","It is usually argued (and also joked about) that classifying sets into open and closed is a bit paradoxical, since sets can be open and closed at the same time, or neither. This can be analyzed very clearly by noting that closed is an antonym of open : it means exactly not open (and vice versa). Then, by saying that a set is clopen, or open and closed, we are in some way claiming that the set is open and not open, and this is a basic contradiction from a logical point of view. While I don't dare to think that I can make an impact on the use of these terms by changing the way I myself call some sets, it would be  much easier for me to at least think of them with different names. Particularly, I've been wondering about the correctness of saying co-open instead of closed . In the first place, it makes sense because it's more natural to see the link between declaring $A$ is co-open and the complement of $A$ is open . Also, since complementation is an involution, in some natural way we can say that a co-co-open set , which we may understand as a set whose complement has an open complement , is nothing but an open set; this, I believe, is desirable behavior for the use of the co- prefix. My final worry about the correctness of using co-open is that the co- prefix is widely used in category theory, and is formalized by the notion of duality (to name but a few examples: initial and coinitial , or terminal and coterminal , product and coproduct , limit and colimit , cone and cocone ). So I've been wondering whether there should be some categorical formulation of a topology so that saying $A$ is co-open in $\mathcal{C}$ was equivalent to saying $A$ is open in $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ , where $\mathcal{C}$ was the categorical formulation of a topology in which $A$ is a closed set. This, in order to justify the use of co- with duality. However, I am aware of the existence of other terms which start with the prefix co- but, I believe, don't have a possible categorical formulation or which were named before they were redefined in terms of categorical notions, like cologarithm , cosine , cosecant , cotangent , cotree . My question would then be: aside from the issue that every mathematician writes closed , could co-open be considered correct as a terminological alternative, based on the points I exposed, and on others I might possibly have missed? At the end, if co-open is correct, this will be only useful for my own pedagogical reasons. Thanks.","['general-topology', 'category-theory', 'terminology']"

30807,Algorithm(s) for computing an elementary symmetric polynomial,"I've run into an application where I need to compute a bunch of elementary symmetric polynomials . It is trivial to compute a sum or product of quantities, of course, so my concern is with computing the ""other"" symmetric polynomials. For instance (I use here the notation $\sigma_n^k$ for the $k$-th symmetric polynomial in $n$ variables), the Vieta formulae allow me to compute a bunch of symmetric polynomials all at once like so: $$\begin{align*}
&(x+t)(x+u)(x+v)(x+w)\\
&\qquad =x^4+\sigma_4^1(t,u,v,w)x^3+\sigma_4^2(t,u,v,w)x^2+\sigma_4^3(t,u,v,w)x+\sigma_4^4(t,u,v,w)
\end{align*}$$ and, as I have said, $\sigma_4^1$ and $\sigma_4^4$ are trivial to compute on their own without having to resort to Vieta. But what if I want to compute $\sigma_4^3$ only without having to compute all the other symmetric polynomials? More generally, my application involves a large-ish number of arguments, and I want to be able to compute ""isolated"" symmetric polynomials without having to compute all of them. Thus, I'm looking for an algorithm for computing $\sigma_n^k$ given only $k$ and the arguments themselves, without computing the other symmetric polynomials. Are there any, or can I not do better than Vieta?","['symmetric-polynomials', 'algebra-precalculus', 'algorithms', 'polynomials']"

I'm fairly certain it does, but I'm hoping to see a rigorous proof of this statement. Thanks. Here is my motivation. I'm working on a strange little problem. I'm working in a geometry over an ordered field. Suppose I have a circle $\Gamma$ with center $A$ passing through a point $B$. I want to prove that there are infinitely many points on $\Gamma$. Up to a change of variable, I'm considering the unit circle centered on the origin over $\mathbb{Q}$. To show there are an infinite number of points on $\Gamma$, it suffices to show there are an infinite number of solutions to $a^2+b^2=1$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$. I could then extend this to showing there are infinite number of solutions to $a^2+b^2=r^2$ for some $r$, which proves that any circle over $\mathbb{Q}$ has an infinite number of points. Then since any ordered field has a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$, I would be finished.","['geometry', 'arithmetic', 'diophantine-equations']"

  Compute $\Delta u = u_{xx} + u_{yy}$

I tried to prove this directly, by thinking that $$ u_{xx} = \frac{d^2f}{dr^2} \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \frac{df}{dr} \frac{\partial ^2r}{\partial x^2}$$ and 
$$ u_{yy} = \frac{d^2f}{dr^2} \frac{\partial r}{\partial y} + \frac{df}{dr} \frac{\partial ^2r}{\partial y^2}.$$

=  \frac{d^2f}{dr^2} \frac{r(\cos \theta + \sin \theta)}{r} + \frac{df}{dr}\frac{1}{r}.$$ Any idea on where I'm going wrong? It looks like I need $\displaystyle{\frac{r(\cos \theta + \sin \theta)}{r} = 1}$.","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates']"

30870,Numerical gradient of approximated probability function,"I want to find an approximation of the gradient $\nabla V(J)$ of the following function $V(J) = P(X\in T(J))$. Where $X$ is a multidimensional stochastic vector with a smooth continuous probability density and $T$ is a (convex) set that depends on some parameters $J=(J_1,...,J_n)$. $V(J)$ is considered to be many times continuously differentiable. I have $N$ independent samples $x_n$ drawn from $X$. And $V(J)$ is approximated with the relative frequency
$$\hat{V}(J)=\frac{ | \{n \mid x_n\in T(J) \}| }{N}.$$
The approximation is piecewise constant. Now I want to find an operator $\hat{D}$ that approximates the gradient. For example: If J is one-dimensional. The gradient could be approximated by central difference $\hat{D}\hat{V}(J) = \frac{\hat{V}(J+h)-\hat{V}(J-h)}{2h}$. The problem with central difference is that since $\hat{V}$ is piecewise constant if $h$ is chosen too small, the difference is identically $0$ for most $J$. The number of evaluations of $\hat{V}$ should be kept small as it is naturally quite expensive to compute. 
The approximation should be consistent in the sense that it becomes more accurate as $N$ increases. Is there a standard way to solve this problem? 
Is there a limit on how accurate the approximation could get?

The supplied $r$ and $\phi$ are the altitude and flightpath angle at the point of the first tangential burn. These are preserved during the burn while $a$ and $e$ are changed. $R_{a}$ / $R_{p}$ is the radius of the destination orbit.

The standard Excel solver is unable to solve this problem, because it requires a smooth function, but the (expensive) Premium solver seems able to do it. My suggestion for an algorithm would be following 2-step method: Given the finite set of values for C, for each C, optimize L1 and L2. Then, optimum C* would the C with the lowest RMSE given L1* and L2*. Would that be correct? Or is there a more elegant way to it? Any helpful comments are appreciated.

  a Markov matrix might not be embeddable if it describes the annual changes
  in a population that has a strongly seasonal breeding pattern; in such cases
  one might construct a more elaborate model that incorporates the seasonal

The question, roughly speaking, is: how should I think of the $M^{\chi}$'s? What is their meaning, and function? How else are they characterized? I've taken a course in representation theory a few years back, so it's all a little vague, but if I remember correctly, $\mathbb{C}[\Delta]$ is the direct sum of $|\Delta|$ many simple submodules, in bijection with the $\chi$'s. Then the $e_{\chi}$'s can be interpreted as being the decomposition of $1$ ($1=\sum_{\chi} e_{\chi}$, where $e_{\chi}$ is in the simple submodule of $\mathbb{C}[\Delta]$ corresponding to $\chi$). But I don't see how this translates to a decomposition of some random module $M$. $M$ is a direct sum of simple submodules.

In general, if $f''$ is continuous and $r$ is a simple root of $f$ it holds that
$e_{n+1}=x_{n+1}-\sqrt{r}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{f''(\xi_n)}{f'(x_n)}e_n^2$, where $\xi_n$ is some number between $x_n$ and $\sqrt{r}$. I suppose that the condition they're asking for is achieved (but I'm not sure) when

So if $E[X]$ , $E[Y]$ , $E[Z]$ defined, we know that $E[X]\cdot E[Y]=E[Z]$. But, I really curious  whether there's a situation when $E[X]$,  $E[Y]$  defined, but $E[X\cdot Y]$ ($E[Z]$) is $\infty$ or even  Diverging? I wasnt able to think of an answer.

31473,The idea's clear; the proof isn't,"I'm working through Enderton's book on set theory. In chapter 3, there are a series of exercises regarding functions. For instance Prove that if $F$ and $G$ are functions, $dom(F) = dom(G)$, and $F(x) = G(x)$ for all $x$ in the common domain, then $F = G$. Assume that $F$ and $G$ are functions. Show that $F \subseteq G$ if and only if $dom(F) \subseteq dom(G)$ and $F(x) = G(x)$ for all $x \in dom(F)$. If I think about the statements, I come up with the following ""sketches:"" Suppose $(x,F(x)) \in F$. Then $x \in dom(F)$. Since $dom(F) = dom(G)$, $x \in dom(G)$ and $(x,G(x)) \in G$. Since $G(x) = F(x)$ for all $x$ in the common domain, $(x,F(x)) \in G$. The other direction is similar. Assume $F$ and $G$ are functions. Then $F \subseteq G$ iff $(x,y) \in F$ implies $(x,y) \in G$. Hence, $x \in dom(F)$ implies $x \in dom(G)$ and $dom(F) \subseteq dom(G)$. Similarly, $(x,y) \in F$ implies $(x,y) \in G$ iff $F(x) = G(x)$ for all $x \in dom(F)$ since $F$ and $G$ are functions and $y$ is uniquely determined by $x$. But these are not formal proofs. I am having trouble in these exercises with formalizing the idea that I want to express. Hence, the question (request) is for an example of a formalization, so that I can see the appropriate style and level of detail involved.",['elementary-set-theory']
31479,About the Three Reflections Theorem,"I recently solved this exercise from Hartshorne's Classical Geometry. Given three lines $a$ , $b$ , $c$ through a point $O$ , show that there exists a unique fourth line $d$ such that $$\sigma_c\sigma_b\sigma_a=\sigma_d,$$ where $\sigma$ denotes the reflection in a given line. In the diagram below, I take $A\in a$ , let $B$ be the reflection of $A$ across $b$ , $C$ be the reflection of $B$ across $c$ , and then let $d$ be the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ . I was able to prove $\sigma_c\sigma_b\sigma_a=\sigma_d$ , which I will be happy to include if someone asks. Anyway, based on that, I know that $\sigma_d$ fixes $O$ , and thus passes through $O$ . My follow up question to this exercise is, is the angle between $a$ and $d$ congruent to the angle between $b$ and $c$ ? I'm curious to know, because if so, I believe this implies that given three reflection axes through a point, we can rotate two of them so that one coincides with the third, hence cancelling, and the image of the first rotated line will be the desired $d$ . I have a hunch it is true based on an earlier question, but this seems like a different way of proving it. I've included a picture with which angles I know are congruent, and I assume I'm working in a Euclidean plane. Thanks for any insight.",['geometry']

31492,"Solving $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}_+^*, f'(x) = f\left(\frac1{x}\right)$","I recently came across this equation : $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}_+^*, f'(x) = f\left(\frac1{x}\right)$$where $f \in \mathcal{C}^1(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$. I've done the following, but I'm stuck at the end. Could you give me pointers? Thanks! Differentiating yields $$\forall x, f''(x) = -\frac1{x^2}f(x) \tag{$S_0$}$$Solutions in the form $$x \mapsto \frac1{x^\phi}$$ work iff $\phi(\phi+1) = -1 $, ie. $\phi = \frac{-1 \pm i \sqrt{3}}{2} =e^{\pm 2i\pi/3} = j, \overline{j}$. Elements of the vector space generated by the free pair $(x^j, x^\overline{j})$ are therefore solutions of ($S_0$). I then feed $\lambda x^j + \mu x^\overline{j}$ in the original equation, which yields $-\lambda j\frac1{x^{j+1}}-\mu\overline{j}\frac1{x^{\overline{j} + 1}} = \frac{x^{j + \overline{j}}}{\lambda x^\overline{j} + \mu x^j}$, then $(-\lambda j x^{\overline{j}+1} - \mu \overline{j} x^{j+1})(\lambda x^{\overline{j}} + \mu x^j) = x^{1+j+\overline{j}} = x^0 = 1$, and $-\lambda^2 j x^{2\overline{j} + 1} - \mu^2 \overline{j} x^{2j+1} - \lambda\mu(j + \overline{j}) = 0 $. Thus, $$ \lambda^2 j x^{-2i\sin(2\pi/3)} + \mu^2 \overline{j} x^{2i\sin(2\pi/3)} = \lambda\mu$$ Does that mean that no solutions can be found to the original equation, except the trivial $x \mapsto 0$ one? Or that I didn't take the right approach? I can't figure out how to handle the last equality.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'complex-analysis', 'functional-equations']"

31513,Euler's phi function and distinct primes,"It is true that $\phi(p) = (p-1)$ only if p is a prime. I had also proven (I am not sure if this is a trivial fact or not) that $\phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$ only if p and q are distinct primes. However, I am having difficulty generalizing the result. It certainly seems true that if $\phi(p_1\cdot p_2\cdots p_n) = (p_1 - 1)(p_2 - 1)\cdots (p_n-1)$ then each $p_i$ are distinct primes. What I had done in the initial proof for the case n = 2 was to use the the formula $\phi(pq) = \phi(p)\phi(q)\frac{d}{\phi(d)}$ where d = gcd(p,q) and the fact that if $a \mid b$ then $\phi(a) \mid \phi(b)$ to show that $d \mid 1$. The result follows quite easily after showing that p and q are coprime. However, this proof does not seem to be extendable to the general case. I hope that someone can help me with this.","['prime-numbers', 'totient-function', 'number-theory']"
31515,Kullback-Leibler divergence based kernel,"I'm looking at this paper: ""A Kullback-Leibler Divergence Based Kernel for SVM Classification in Multimedia Applications"" .

But it's not obvious from this paper that this kernel is positive definite.
How it can be proved that the kernel is positive definite? Also, it's well known that $\exp (-a (D_{KL}(p,q) + D_{KL}(q,p)))$ can be positive definite if and only if $(D_{KL}(p,q) + D_{KL}(q,p))$ is a negative definite kernel.

31525,The modular curve X(N),"I have a question about the modular curve X(N), which classifies elliptic curves with full level N structure. (A level N structure of an elliptic curve E is an isomorphism
from $Z/NZ \times Z/NZ$ to the group of N-torsion points on E). Some notation: $\Gamma(N)$ is the subgroup of SL$_2(\mathbb{Z})$, which contains all the matrices congruent to the identity matrix modulo N. $\mathbb{H}$ is the upper halfplane. $\Gamma(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$ is a Riemannsurface classifying elliptic curves with level N structure and the additional condition that the two base points we choose map to a certain N-th root of unity under the Weil pairing. The problem is that this curve is only defined over
$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N)$. Apparently if we leave out the condition with the Weil pairing, we get a curve X(N) defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ which has $\phi(N)$ geometric components isomorphic to $\Gamma(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$.
Is there a good way for constructing the curve X(N) from $\Gamma(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$? Unfortunately the author refers to a french paper by Deligne-Rapoport.(I don't speak French) Do you know any better references for this?","['modular-arithmetic', 'elliptic-curves', 'number-theory']"

A root of $\operatorname{Trop}(f)$ is a tuple $w$ such that the maximum of $\lbrace -v(a_j) +\langle w, j \rangle \rbrace$ is attained at least twice. The fundamental theorem of tropical geometry states $v(V(I)) = \operatorname{Roots}(\operatorname{Trop}(I))$ (actually $\text{the topological closure of } v(V(I)) = \operatorname{Roots}(\operatorname{Trop}(I))$, or $v(V(I)) = \operatorname{Roots}(\operatorname{Trop}(I))\cap \mathbb{Q}^n$  in the case of the Puiseux field). Trivially $v(V(I)) \subseteq \operatorname{Roots}( \operatorname{Trop}(I))$, nevertheless the converse is not so easy to prove.
