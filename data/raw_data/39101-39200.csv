383556,Solution to $\Delta_g u = \delta-1$ on a 2-sphere.,"Let $S^2$ be the two-sphere, endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$, such that the volume of the sphere w.r.t. this metric is $4\pi$. Let $a \in S^2$. I am looking for an easy way to prove that the equation
$$
\Delta_g u = 4 \pi \delta_a -1
$$
has a solution $u \in W^{1,p}$, $p \in (1,2)$. This is an attempt I made: the weak formulation of this equation is
$$
-\int_{S^2} (\nabla \phi, \nabla u)_g d\mu_g = 4 \pi\phi(a) -\int_{S^2} \phi d\mu_g ,
$$
where integration is performed with respect to the measure induced by $g$, and $(\cdot, \cdot)_g$ is the inner product w.r.t. $g$.
We notice that the RHS of the previous equation is an element of $(W^{1,p})'$, for $p > 2$, by Sobolev embedding. I would then like to use some kind of  representation of $(W^{1,p})'$ to conclude that this functional can be represented as
$$
\int_{S^2} (\nabla \phi, \nabla u)_g d\mu_g
$$
for some $u$. Are there any ways to conclude? I guess this is pretty standard stuff, I would be very grateful if anyone could provide me a reference.","['reference-request', 'riemannian-geometry', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
383564,$\mathbb Z_{p^n}$ is not the direct product of any family of its proper subgroups,"I'm trying to solve this question of Hungerford's Algebra book: $S_3$ is not the direct product of any family of its proper subgroups.
  The same is true of $\mathbb Z_{p^n}$ . The first claim is easy: we note that every subgroup of $S_3$ is of order $2$ or $3$ by Lagrange, since its subgroups are of prime order, they are cyclic, then abelian, but $S_3$ is not abelian, contradiction because $S_3$ is not abelian while the direct product of abelian groups has to be abelian.

383653,In order to factor we must find its zeros?,"I am self-learning precalc (Precalculus Demystified) and found the following problem on page 170 : Completely factor the the polynomial. $P(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x + 3; c = 3$ is a zero. Since $c = 3$ is a zero, I know $x - 3$ is a factor (and remainder is zero). So I go ahead and do the division and end up with the following : $(x - 3)(x^2 - 2x - 1)$ However, this needs to be factored even further, so I do the square and end up with : $(x - 3)((x - 1)^2 - 2)$ Now I'm scratching my head because it doesn't look like the nice factors I'm used to seeing, so I check my progress in the book and they say the following : ""In order to factor $x^2 - 2x - 1$, we must first find its zeros"" Now I understand that in order to find the intercepts on a graph I must find its zeros, but what does finding its zeros have to do with factoring this equation? I'm completely lost at this point because though I can take it at face value and proceed, I need to understand the why before I feel comfortable plowing ahead or I'm going to dig myself into an even deeper pool of confusion. :( Any thoughts? Thanks in advance! Update : Due to the answers I'm getting, I need to clarify my question to pinpoint my actual confusion. Thank you for your quick replies! I'm so sorry but I'm a little slow in understanding the implication. My problem is that I don't understand how factoring and finding zeros is related. For me, factoring is finding what are the root divisors of a number or equation. For example, 3 is a factor of 9 because 3 * 3 = 9. When I look for factors of 9, I don't think about finding zeros... I don't even know what that means! I just look to see what multiplied by what gives me 9. In an equation such as x^2 + 2xy + y^2, I understand how to factor this to (x + y)^2... this I understand the why of and how to do it. But in all the times I have done it, never once have I thought about ""finding the zero"" of anything nor have I approached it thinking about zeros at all. This may betray an immense ignorance of some basic understanding on my part, but this is why I'm asking this question... I would love to know what I'm missing and what zeros have to do with anything. For finding the x/y intercepts, yes, I understand how zero relates... for factoring I don't. :(","['factoring', 'algebra-precalculus']"

383682,"Calculus on Manifolds (Spivak), theorem 2-13","I'm having trouble understanding this theorem: 2-13 Theorem. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$, where $p \leq n$. If $f(a) = 0$ and the $p \times n$ matrix $(D_jf^i(a))$ has rank $p$, then there is an open set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing $a$ and a differentiable function $h: A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with differentiable inverse such that 
  $$f \circ h(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^{n-p+1}, \ldots, x^n).$$ It seems like the function $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{4}$, around $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, serves as a counterexample. Obviously this function is continuously differentiable everywhere, and $f(a) = 0$, and the derivative $f'(x) = 2x$ is nonzero at $a$. Since the domain of $h$ is $A$ which contains $a$, there must be $h(a)$ such that $f(h(a)) = a$ by the statement of the theorem, i.e., $f(h(-\frac{1}{2})) = -\frac{1}{2}$, but this is impossible as $f$ attains its minimum at $(0, -\frac{1}{4})$. I looked at the proof and it seems that there is an error here: Proof. We can consider $f$ as a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{n-p} \times \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^p$. If $\det M \neq 0$, then $M$ is the $p \times p$ matrix $(D_{n_p+j}f^i(a))$, $1 \leq i, j \leq p$, then we are precisely in the situation considered in the proof of Theorem 2-12, and as we showed in that proof, there is $h$ such that $f \circ h(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^{n-p+1}, \ldots, x^n)$. The error is that ""the situation considered in the proof of Theorem 2-12"" establishes the existence of $h(x)$ where $x$ is in a neighbourhood of $(a^1, \ldots, a^{n-p}, 0, \ldots, 0)$ (by considering a function $F$ that replaces the last $p$ coordinates of $x$ by $f(x)$, then applying the inverse function theorem) rather than in a neighbourhood of $a$ itself.

383718,"Equivalent bounded metric: Why should one prefer $\frac{d}{1+d}$ over $\min\{d,1\}$?","This is my first question and I hope it is not considered too argumentative. It is often useful to change the metric on a space to an equivalent bounded metric. Traditionally, people use
$$
\delta(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}.
$$
For example for the metric on product spaces: one equips
$$
\prod_{i=1}^\infty X_i
$$
with the metric $d(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \delta_i(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \frac{d_i(x,y)}{1+d_i(x,y)}$. Similarly, when equipping the unit ball of the dual space of a separable normed space with a metric inducing the weak$^\ast$-topology, people tend to use a  construction using $\delta$. Or when metrizing convergence in measure on a probability space. Is there any real advantage of this metric over, say,
$$
d'(x,y) = \min\{d(x,y),1\}\: ?
$$
It is much easier to check that $d'$ is an equivalent metric on $(X,d)$ than proving that $\delta$ is an equivalent metric. So why do people use $\delta$? The only reason I can imagine (apart from tradition) is that knowing $\delta$ one can recover $d$.

I need a little hint in a proof on convergence of a sequence. The problem I have is: Suppose $(x_n)$ is a monotone decreasing sequence of real numbers such that $\sum x_n$ converges, prove that: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} nx_n=0$$ My idea is: proving this fact aims to prove that given $\epsilon >0$ there's some natural $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n >n_0$ we have $|nx_n|<\epsilon$. Now, I know that $\sum x_n$ converges, so that given $\epsilon'>0$ there's some $k_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k > k_0$ we have: $$\left|\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i - S\right|<\epsilon'$$ Where $S = \sum x_n$. Now, since $(x_n)$ is monotone decreasing we know that we must have $x_1 > \cdots > x_k$ so that the sum of all $x_i$ should be less or equal to $k x_k$. So I know that I have: $$\left|\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i - S\right|\leq\left|\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_i\right|+|S|\leq|kx_k|+|S|$$ I feel that the proof will come from this, however I'm stuck at this point. Can someone give just a little hint on how to proceed from here? Thanks very much in advance for your help.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

383887,Describe a sine wave of known frequency with only two points,"This is my first post on math.stackexchange (sorry if meta people remove the Hello (sometimes we do that over on stackoverflow ;P)! I have a system wherein I know that the output is a sine wave, with a known frequency.  My objective is to find the approximate (x,y) of the first peak (i.e., find the phase shift of the signal).  An important point is that I do not need to know y, or the amplitude, of this peak.  Essentially, I can poll the system at a given angular shift (represented by x), and receive a y value in return.  I start with zero points, and want to poll the minimum number of x points in order to be able to know where to poll to receive a max y value. I believe that I can describe the sine wave with only two points, yet I do not know how to calculate this (it's on a motion controller, so I have quite limited functionality).  My thoughts so far:  phase = -sin^-1(y) - wt + 2*pi*n, but I don't know how to easily fit this with two points. Once I know the fitted sine wave, I will be able to determine which x should yield a max amplitude peak y, and then subsequently poll the x location. If this can be done, the final solution would account for noise in the system (i.e. each y point polled will be within a given tolerance... thus, the two or more points polled to fit the sine wave would cause additive errors...), but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

Hence there are 3 possible scenarios because of the \$5 constraint: (I)  AAAAA:  Here we have 5 objects for group A's n=5 obj + 4 dividers = 9, r=5 obj (II) BAAA:  Since there is only one B item here, I thought I could leave it out and only calculate the placement of 3 objects in AAA.  This is because I can have only one object in B, but am free to choose the distribution among the other A's.
n= 3 obj + 2 dividers = 5, r = 3 obj (III) BBA:  Again since B's have only one item, and A is only 5 values, this group is simply 5.

By Lagrange's theorem , $\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ divides $(p - 1)$, so let $r = r_p(2) = \dfrac{p-1}{\operatorname{ord}_p(2)}$. Question: can $r$ be arbitrarily large? That is, given any $M$, does there always exist some $p$ such that $r_p(2) > M$? (Note that when $2$ is a primitive root modulo $p$, we have $r_p(2) = 1$, so what we're asking for is primes for which $2$ is arbitrarily ""far"" from being a primitive root.) One way this would be true is if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes . If $p$ is a Mersenne prime, say $p = 2^q - 1$ for some $q$, then $p$ divides (is equal to) $2^q - 1$, and smaller powers of $2$ are less than $p$, so $\operatorname{ord}_p(2) = q$, and $r_p(2) = \dfrac{p-1}{q} = \dfrac{2^q - 1}{q}$ which can be arbitrarily large if there are infinitely many such $q$. But of course maybe the answer is yes without assuming the existence of infinitely many Mersenne primes. Is it? Is something known about this problem? (Is $2$ special at all?)

384590,Find no. of points where $f$ and $g$ meet.,"If $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(x)=x \sin x+ \cos x$ then (A) $f$ and $g$ agree at no points (B) $f$ and $g$ agree at exactly one point (C) $f$ and $g$ agree at exactly two points (A) $f$ and $g$ agree at more than two points. Trial: I think I need to find the values of $x$ for which $f(x)=g(x)$ . So, I have $x^2-x \sin x- \cos x=0$ . How can I solve this ? Please help","['calculus', 'functions']"
