3539726,finite index subgroups in free group non-trivial intersection with each of the non-trivial subgroups of the free group.,"I was reading a paper and find this statement in the abstract, ""If $H$ has finite index in $F_m$ , then $H$ has non-trivial intersection with each of the non-trivial subgroups of $F_m$ "" where $F_m$ is a free group of rank m. The author claims that it's a obvious statement but I don't see how. All I know is, as $[F_m:H]<\infty$ , $H$ is finitely generated and free(being subgroup of a free group $F_m$ ).

3539745,Prove that all cyclic groups are Abelian.,"Prove that all cyclic groups are Abelian. For some group $G$ , define a cyclic subgroup of $G$ as $\left \langle a \right \rangle = \{a^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}, a \in G\}$ Then it follows that $a^n,a^m \in \left \langle a \right \rangle$ is always true. We wish to show that $\left \langle a \right \rangle$ is abelian, or that $$a^na^m = a^ma^n$$ So... $$a^na^m=a^{n+m}=a^{m+n}=a^ma^n$$ Hence, every cyclic group is Abelian since for all $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ , $a^na^m=a^ma^n$ . Is that really all we have to do? This proof seems way too easy but also right. Thanks!","['group-theory', 'solution-verification', 'cyclic-groups']"
3539750,"A CMIMC Integration Bee integral: $\int_0^\infty \left( \sin(1/x) - \frac{\sin(\pi/x)}{\pi} \right) \,dx$","At the 2020 CMIMC Integration Bee, the following integral was one of the qualifying problems: $$\int_0^\infty \left( \sin(1/x) - \frac{\sin(\pi/x)}{\pi} \right) \,dx.$$ I attempted to use differentiation under the integral sign: $$f(t) = \int_0^\infty \left( \sin(t/x) - \frac{\sin(\pi t/x)}{\pi} \right) \,dx$$ $$f'(t) = \int_0^\infty \left( \frac{\cos(t/x) - \cos(\pi t/x)}{x}\right) \,dx.$$ We are very close to being able to use the Frullani integral, that is, $$\int_0^\infty \frac{f(ax)-f(bx)}{x} \, dx = \ln \left( \frac{b}{a} \right) \cdot \left( f(0) - \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \right)$$ for $f$ continuously differentiable on the nonnegative reals. However, if we try to use it with $f(x)=\cos(1/x)$ , we obtain $$f'(t) = (\ln \pi) \left( \cos(1/0) - \lim_{x \to \infty} \cos(1/x) \right),$$ which is nonsensical. This happens, of course, because $f$ is not continuously differentiable or even defined at $0$ . But if we were able to show that $$\int_0^\infty \left( \frac{\cos(t/x) - \cos(\pi t/x)}{x}\right) \,dx = (\ln \pi) \left(\lim_{x \to \infty} \cos(1/x) \right) = \ln \pi,$$ (which is true according to Wolfram Alpha,) then we would have $$f(1) = f(0) + \int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 \ln \pi \, dx = \ln \pi,$$ which is the correct answer. Any hints or solutions for how to complete my solution or for an entirely different solution are appreciated!","['integration', 'calculus', 'contest-math']"

3539841,Why does this formula from Silverman give the tangent lines of a cusp or node?,"On page 44 of Arithmetic of ECs, Silverman explains that given a weierstrass equation $f \in K[x,y]$ and singular point $P=(x_0, y_0)$ with $\partial f / \partial x(P) = \partial f / \partial y (P) = 0$ that one can rearrange the Taylor expansion of $f$ at P to get: $$f(x,y) - f(x_0, y_0) = ((y-y_0) - \alpha (x-x_0))((y-y_0) - \beta (x-x_0)) - (x- x_0)^3,$$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \overline K$ . He then goes on to say $(y-y_0) - \alpha (x-x_0)$ and $(y-y_0) - \beta (x-x_0)$ are the tangent lines of $f$ at $P$ (if $P$ is a cusp then they coincide). This might be a silly question, but why are these the tangent lines? I assume this follows from where they appear in the Taylor expansion but I can't figure out why.","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"

3540068,What is the optimal number of dice to roll a Yahtzee in one roll?,"Description In the game of Yahtzee, 5 dice are rolled to determine a score. One of the resulting rolls is called a Yahtzee. To roll a Yahtzee you must have 5 of a kind. (5 1's or 5 2's or 5 3's etc..). In the game of Yahtzee you can only have 5 dice. However, for the purpose of this question I want to entertain adding more dice to the equation. Therefore I'd like to define a Yahtzee as follows: To roll a Yahtzee you must have exactly 5 of a kind, no more or no less. (5 1's or 5 2's or 5 3's etc..). Examples Let's look at some rolls with 6 dice The following would be a Yahtzee: 1 1 1 1 1 4 6 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 3 5 5 5 The following would not be a Yahtzee: 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 - Note that the last roll does technically contain 5 1's, however because the roll as an entirety contains 6 1's this is not a Yahtzee. Let's look at some rolls with 12 dice The following would be a Yahtzee: 1 1 2 1 2 1 4 4 1 3 6 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 - Note that the first roll is a Yahtzee with 5 1's, this roll is to illustrate that order doesn't matter. - Note that the second roll has 2 Yahtzees, this is a roll that counts as a Yahtzee - Note that the third roll has a Yahtzee with 1's but has 7 2's. This roll is a Yahtzee because it contains exactly 5 1's. The 7 2's do not nullify this roll. The following would not be a Yahtzee: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 - Note that the last roll has 6 1's and 6 6's. Because exactly 5 of one number (no more, no less) is not present, this roll does not contain a Yahtzee. The Question What is the optimal number of dice to roll a Yahtzee in one roll?

3540089,Orientation of stereographic projection,"I was reading Lee and was wondering if the stereographic projection of the north pole and the south pole are in the same oriented smooth atlas. To be more precise, we have $\sigma_N: S^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by: $$

3540214,The Hankel Integral Representation for $\Gamma(z)$,"I am trying to understand some details hidden in the proof of the Hankel integral representation for the gamma function: $$\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)} = -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\mathcal{H}} (-t)^{-z} e^{-t} dt$$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ . Here $\mathcal{H}$ denotes the Hankel contour: $\mathcal{H} = [i + \infty,i] + \mathcal{H}_{sc} + [-i,-i + \infty]$ , where $\mathcal{H}_{sc}$ joins $i$ with $-i$ along a positively oriented semicircle centered at $0$ . A typical approach to the proof, as far as I understand it, goes as follows: Cut the plane along the positive real axis and choose a fixed branch of the multifunction $(-t)^{-z}$ by taking its principal branch for negative real $t$ , and by continuing this branch analytically to the cut plane. Let $\varepsilon\mathcal{H}$ denote $\mathcal{H}$ scaled by $\varepsilon$ , i.e., after applying the transformation $z \mapsto \varepsilon z$ . The integral along $\varepsilon\mathcal{H}$ is then said to be the same as the one along $\mathcal{H}$ by Cauchy's theorem. This is a first step that I find unclear: I understand that the integrand is analytic in $\mathbb{C} \setminus [0,\infty)$ ; however I do not know about any deformation theorem for improper contours. Could someone describe a rigorous argument that is used here? Assume $z < 0$ and take $\varepsilon \to 0$ . The integral can then be decomposed into three integrals, two of which can be manipulated to obtain an integral much alike the usual integral representation of $\Gamma(1-z)$ for $\mathrm{Re}(1-z) > 0$ , while the remaining one can be shown to be negligible when $\varepsilon \to 0$ , thanks to the assumption $z < 0$ . The Hankel representation is then proved for $z < 0$ . Finally, the result is extended to the whole complex plain via analytic continuation. This is a second step that I find unclear , as it can only be performed if one knows that $$I(z) = \int_{\mathcal{H}} (-t)^{-z} e^{-t} dt$$ is an analytic function of $z$ . This property is usually qualified as obvious. Nevertheless, I have no idea about why it is obvious. Could someone explain the rigorous arguments needed to perform the two critical steps mentioned above? I would also be very grateful for pointers to literature that treats the Hankel representation rigorously (the treatements that I have found seem more-or-less sketchy to me).

This is from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology , Example 2.43: Lens Spaces, page 144--146. Given integer $m > 1$ and integers $l_{1}, \ldots, l_{n}$ relatively prime to $m$ . 
Define action of $\mathbb Z_{m} = \langle \rho \rangle$ on $S^{2n-1} \subset \mathbb C^{n}$ by $\rho(z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}) = (e^{2\pi i l_{1}/m} z_{1}, \ldots, e^{2\pi i l_{n}/m} z_{n})$ . Lens space $L = L_{m}(l_{1}, \ldots, l_{n}) := S^{2n-1} / \mathbb Z_{m}$ . Devide unit circle $C$ in $n$ -th $\mathbb C$ factor of $\mathbb C^{n}$ by taking points $e^{2\pi ij/m} \in C$ as vertices, $j = 1, \ldots, m$ . Joining the $j$ -th vertex of $C$ to unit sphere $S^{2n-3} \subset \mathbb C^{n-1}$ by arcs of great circles in $S^{2n-1}$ . All these arcs form a $(2n-2)$ -dimensional ball $B_{j}^{2n-2}$ , which is homeomorphic to $D^{2n-2}$ and bounded by $S^{2n-3}$ . Similarly, joining the $j$ -th edge of $C$ to $S^{2n-3}$ gives a ball $B_{j}^{2n-1}$ bounded by $B_{j}^{2n-2}$ and $B_{j+1}^{2n-2}$ . Rotation $\rho$ takes $S^{2n-3}$ to itself while rotating $C$ by angle $2\pi l_{n} / m$ , hence $\rho$ permutes the $B_{j}^{2n-1}$ 's and $B_{j}^{2n-2}$ 's. For $r$ s.t. $r l_{n} = 1 \bmod m$ , $\rho^{r}$ takes each $B_{j}^{2n-1}$ and $B_{j}^{2n-2}$ to the next one. $(r, m) = 1$ , $\rho^{r}$ is a generator of $\mathbb Z_{m}$ .

3540234,Continuity over a Compact Implies Uniform Continuity,"There is a well-known theorem in mathematical analysis that says Suppose $f:M\to N$ is a function from a metric space $(M,d_M)$ to another metric space $(N,d_N)$ . Assume that $M$ is compact. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous over $(M,d_M)$ . For now, let us take $M=[a,b]$ , $N=\mathbb{R}$ , $d_M=d_N=|\cdot|$ . I have seen two different proofs for this case. T. A. Apostol, Calculus, Volume 1, 2nd Edition, Page 152, 1967. C. C. Pugh, Real Mathematical Analysis, 2nd Edition, Page 85, 2015. Apostol argues by contradiction using the method of bisections and the least upper bound property. Pugh also explains by contradiction but prefers to use a technique that one of my teachers called it continuous induction to prove that $[a\,\,\,b]$ is sequentially compact and then uses this property to prove the theorem. Both proofs can be found on the pages mentioned above. Recently, I noticed that Pugh has suggested another approach in exercise 43 of chapter 1 on page 52. However, I couldn't riddle it out. Here is the question Prove that a continuous function defined on an interval $[a\,\,\,b]$ is uniformaly continuous. Hint . Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. Think of $\epsilon$ as fixed and consider the sets \begin{align*}A(\delta)&=\{u\in[a,b]\,|\,\text{if}\,x,t\in[a,u]\,\text{and}\,|x-t|<\delta\,\text{then}\,|f(x)-f(t)|<\epsilon\}, \\
A&=\bigcup_{\delta>0}A(\delta).
\end{align*} Using the least upper bound property, prove that $b\in A$ . Infer that $f$ is uniformly continuous. Can you shed some light on what Pugh is trying to suggest in the hint? Uniform Continuity In the definition of continuity we have that $$\forall x\in[a,b],\,\,\forall\epsilon>0,\,\,\exists\delta>0,\,\,\forall t\in[a,b]\,\wedge\,|t-x|<\delta\,\implies|f(t)-f(x)|<\epsilon$$ Here the delta depends on $x$ and $\epsilon$ . Now, fix $\epsilon$ and let $\Delta_{\epsilon}$ be the set that contains all values of $\delta$ corresponding to different $x$ 's. Then uniform continuity is just telling us that $\Delta_\epsilon$ has a minimum. Consequently, this means that there is a $\delta$ that works for all $x\in[a,b]$ . This leads to the following definition $$\forall\epsilon>0,\,\,\exists\delta>0,\,\,\forall x\in[a,b],\,\,\forall t\in[a,b]\,\wedge\,|t-x|<\delta\,\implies|f(t)-f(x)|<\epsilon$$ where $\delta$ only depends on $\epsilon$ .","['continuity', 'uniform-continuity', 'analysis']"
3540243,What's the number of decibinary numbers that evaluate to given decimal number?,"Let's define a decibinary number system, where each bit (or digit) can range from $0$ to $9$ , but it's place value corresponds to the one in the binary system. For example: $$(2020)_{decibinary} = 2 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 2 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 16 + 2 = (18)_{10}$$ Note, that many decibinary numbers can evaluate to the same decimal value, e.g. $$(1220)_{decibinary} = 1 \times 2^3 + 2 \times 2^2 + 2 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 2  = (18)_{10}$$ I am looking for an expression (say function $f$ ) or an efficient algorithm, that, given a decimal number $n$ , gives me a number of decibinary numbers that evaluate to $n$ . Of course I am treating e.g. $(05)_{decibinary}$ the same as $(5)_{decibinary}$ (leading zeros do not matter). As an aside, I found the concept of decibinary numbers in this HackerRank question , where I thought it might actually be useful to be able to quickly compute $f(n)$ to solve the problem efficiently. $$\\$$ Below are my thoughts and approaches to tackle the problem. What I tried was to first see if there is a pattern: $$f(0) = 1 \\ f(1) = 1 \\ f(2) = 2 \\ f(3) = 2 \\ f(4) = 4 \\ f(5) = 4 \\ f(6) = 6 \\ f(7) = 6 \\ f(8) = 10 \\ f(9) = 10 \\ f(10) = 13$$ but $10$ seems to break the pattern, as there are (if I didn't skip anything) $13$ decibinary numbers that evaluate to $(10)_{10}$ : $18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 106, 114, 122, 130, 202, 210, 1002, 1010$ (if it was $14$ I could see some pattern, but unfortunately $10$ cannot be encoded using one digit in decibinary ). What I spotted, however, is that I could recursively calculate $f$ (or use dynamic programming to build up a lookup table bottom-up in order to be able to reuse the computations). For instance, I know that the decibinary number evaluating to $10$ will have at max. $4$ digits (because $(10000)_{decibinary}$ already evaluates to $16$ ). So I can represent $f(10)$ as a sum of the number of ways I can encode $10$ using $4, 3, 2$ and $1$ digit (the latter being $0$ as there is no way I can represent $10$ using 1 digit). Let's try to compute the number of ways to represent $(10)_{10}$ using $b=4$ digits: The first leading digit can only be $1$ ( $1 \times 2^3$ ), and then, the remaining digits need to evaluate to $10 - 8 = 2$ and we can use the lookup : $f(2) = 2$ . Using $b=3$ digits we can use $1$ and $2$ as non-zero leading digits: $1$ will require a lookup $f(6)$ and $2$ will require a lookup of $f(2)$ , giving a sum of $6 + 2 = 8$ which is false (there are only $6$ ways to encode $10$ using $b=3$ bits) because $6$ itself can be encoded using $b=3$ bits and here I am considering two representations two times instead of one (if this makes sense). It seems to me like the lookup needs to be built such that it does not store $f(n)$ but $f(n, b)$ , i.e. the number of ways to encode $(n)_{10}$ in decibinary using $b$ bits (without a leading zero), which already seems like quite a complex (and inefficient) approach to me. Also each time I'd need to perform a check for a minimum number of bits needed to encode a number (e.g. $10$ cannot be encoded using $b=1$ ). What are your thoughts? Is there a neat and a simple way to find $f(n)$ ?","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'computer-science']"

Given they are square of another matrix(let $B$ ) so $B^2=A$ . Taking the determinant on both sides, I get $|B|^2=|A|$ and since $|A|$ is negative, I get $|B|^2<0$ . So $B$ can't have all real entries. Option C is $I$ whose square is $I$ or vice versa. I am having trouble with option D . Since it's determinant is also positive and I can't find a simple matrix which when squared gives that option. I have talked to my teacher .

3540342,"How to describe the function operation ""composition"", $\circ$, using the convention of function notation.","I am in the process of reading Tao's Analysis I after completing Pinter's A Book of Abstract Algebra (pretty new to maths). It recently occurred to me that all operations, ( $+,*, $ etc), seem to behave like functions. This made me think about the function operation of composition , $\circ$ , and how one could possibly define composition in the convention of function notation. I've been playing around with the notation a little bit, and this is what I have so far. Firstly, I'm pretty certain that composition behaves as a binary operation, and the domain is effectively the set of all ordered pairs of all functions (which I will call $T \times T$ ...where $T$ by itself is simply the set of all functions). From what I can tell, the only proposition $P(f,g)$ that needs to be fulfilled for composition is: $\forall x \in \operatorname {dom}(f), f(x) \in \operatorname{dom}(g)$ . Therefore, we have the following definition of composition: $\circ : T \times T \to T$ $(f,g)\mapsto h$ s.t. $\forall x \in \operatorname {dom}(f), f(x) \in \operatorname{dom}(g)$ I'm sure this is probably incorrect, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated! EDIT: After reading some of the comments, it seems like I need to make the following change: $(f,g) \mapsto h=g(f(x))$ s.t. $\forall x \in \operatorname {dom}(f), f(x) \in \operatorname{dom}(g)$","['notation', 'functions']"

For example, if $h(x) = \sin(2\pi x)$ , then its period of $1$ would cause $f(x)$ to be continuous (indeed, $f$ would just equal $h$ ). Can this idea be tweaked to make a proof?

..., $2^m$ dollars. Define Property m : For any nonnegative integer less than $2^{m+1}$ , there is a selection of envelopes whose contents add up to exactly that number of dollars. Use the Well Ordering Principle (WOP) to prove that Property m holds for all nonnegative integers m . Hint : Consider two cases: first, when the target number of dollars is less than $2^m$ and second, when the target number is at least $2^m$ . Solution attempt Let's refer to Property m as $P(m)$ to make things simpler. Let $C$ be the following set: $C = \{ m \mid \text{P(m) doesn't hold for } m\}$ Then, by the WOP, there is a smallest integer $m_0$ in $C$ . $P(m)$ holds for m = 0, since any nonnegative integer less than $2^{0+1} = 2$ can be represented with a selection of envelopes (the integer $0$ can be represented by a selection of no envelopes, and the integer $1$ can be represented with the envelope containing $1$ ). So, $m_0 > 0$ . Also, $P(m_0-1)$ holds (since $m_0-1 < m_0$ ), which means that all nonnegative integers less than $2^{m_0}$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes that contain up to $2^{m_0-1}$ . Since $P(m_0)$ is false, this means that there is a nonnegative integer $c$ less than $2^{m_0 + 1}$ such that $c$ can't be obtained by a selection of the envelopes $1$ , $2$ , $4$ , ..., $2^{m_0}$ . From the above paragraph, we know that $c < 2^{m_0+1}$ , and, from the fact that $P(m_0-1)$ holds, we know that $c \geq 2^{m_0}$ . So: $2^{m_0} \leq c < 2^{m_0+1}$ To show that there is a contradiction, there are two cases: If $c$ is even: Dividing the above inequality by 2, $2^{m_0-1} \leq c/2 < 2^{m_0}$ . So, since $c/2$ is smaller than $2^{m_0}$ , $P(c/2)$ holds and $c/2$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes. However, this means that $2(c/2) = c$ can also be represented as a selection of envelopes, which is a contradiction. If $c$ is odd: Subtracting 1 from the above inequality and dividing it by 2, $2^{m_0-1} - 1/2 \leq (c - 1)/2 < 2^{m_0} - 1/2$ . Since $(c - 1)/2$ is smaller than $2^{m_0}$ , $P((c - 1)/2)$ holds and $(c - 1)/2$ can be represented by a selection of envelopes. However, this means that $2((c - 1)/2) + 1 = c$ can also be represented as a selection of envelopes, which is a contradiction. So, $C$ is empty and $P(m)$ holds for all nonnegative integers $m$ . I didn't use the provided hint in my solution attempt, which makes me think that there might be something incomplete about this attempt.

Prove that $-1$ is not the sum of two squares in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$ .

Suppose that $x^2 + y^2 = -1$ with $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$ . By working in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\pm 7})$ , we can factor this as $(x+iy)(x-iy) = -1$ , where $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$ . It follows that $x+iy$ is an element with complex absolute value $1$ , for any embedding $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\pm 7}) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ , so by the Dirichlet Unit Theorem it follows that $x+iy$ is a root of unity, which must be inside $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\pm 7})$ .

I can see clearly when I plot the function that the area underneath the curve sums to $0$ for n $\neq$ 1,6, however explaining that ""by looking at the plots..."" is most likely not a sufficient answer for this professor. Taking the n=1 case, the integral is: $$
A_1=\int_0^1{\sin(\pi x)\big[\sin(6 \pi x)-\sin(\pi x)\big]\,\mathrm dx}
$$ Breaking this up into the difference of two integrals, the integral over $\sin(\pi x)\sin(6 \pi x)$ evaluates to $0$ for a similar reason. I cannot, however, figure out what it is that I am trying to say. I feel like there is some underlying trigonometric property or concept that I am totally spacing on. It seems to have to do with the product of two sine functions of different periods/frequencies that makes the integrals of said functions evaluate to $0$ . The kind of answer that this professor has accepted in the past has been one like ""clearly $\int_{-\infty}^\infty x\exp(-x^2)\,\mathrm dx$ evaluates to $0$ because the function $x\exp(-x^2)$ is odd."" So if I could just explain why the $n=1,6$ cases yield non-zero values for the $A_n$ integral I would be golden! Any help that could be offered would be greatly appreciated!

One might require only that $H$ have an identity element, not that it is the same as the identity in $G$ . Show that if $H$ has an identity at all, then it is the identity in $G$ , so this definition would be equivalent to the one given. b) Show the analogous thing for inverses. Solution. a) Let $e$ be the identity element of $H$ and $e'$ be the identity element of $G$ . Hence, \begin{align*}
& \forall h \in H, \; he = eh = e \\
& \forall g \in H, \; ge' = e'g = g.
\end{align*} Let $h \in H$ . Then, we have $he = eh = e$ by the identity in $H$ . But $H < G$ , so $H \subset G$ , meaning that $h \in G$ , so $he' = e'h = h$ by the identity in $G$ . But the identity in a group is unique, so $e = e'$ . Hence, the identity in $H$ is also the identity in $G$ . (I'm not sure if a lemma is needed for uniqueness of the identity, but let me write one for the sake of completion.) Lemma. The identity element in a group is unique. Let $e$ and $e'$ be identity elements of $G$ . Then, since $e$ is an identity, we have $$ee' = e'e = e'.$$ Since $e'$ is an identity, we have $$e'e = ee' = e.$$ Hence, $e' = e$ , and the identity is unique. b) Let $h \in H$ . Then there exists an inverse $x \in H$ such that $hx = xh = e$ , where $e$ is the identity in both $H$ and $G$ . But $H < G$ , so $H \subset G$ , meaning $h \in G$ .

Notes: 1- Of course if you have independent $X,Y\sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$ , $0\leq U\leq 1$ and $0\leq V\leq 2$ , but $U$ and $V$ are not independent, e.g. $V=2$ implies $U=\frac{1}{2}$ . So we may restrict our attention to independent unbounded random variables $X, Y$ . (Maybe even positive r.v.s so that $X+Y$ will be non-zero. 2- I think when $X$ and $Y$ are unbounded, then scaling both of them with same constant keeps $U$ unchanged, but we can make $V$ as large or small as possible by varying that constant. So it seems given $U$ , we don't have any information about $V$ . 3- Today in our stat class we showed that for independent $X\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\alpha_1,\beta\right)$ and $Y\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\alpha_2,\beta\right)$ , joint pdf $f_{_{U,V}}\left(u,v\right)$ decomposes into product of marginal pdfs of $U\sim \text{Beta}\left(\alpha_1,\alpha_2\right)$ and $V\sim \text{Gamma}\left(\alpha_1+\alpha_2,\beta\right)$ , hence they are independent.

(2) $0 \neq f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is infinitely irreducible , if for infinitely many $\lambda \in k$ , $f+\lambda$ is irreducible in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ , and call those $\lambda$ 's for which $f+\lambda$ is irreducible good scalars . (3) $0 \neq f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is never irreducible , if there exist no $\lambda \in k$ for which $f+\lambda$ is irreducible in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ . Examples: (i) In $\mathbb{R}[x]$ , $x$ is always irreducible, $x^2$ is infinitely irreducible with good scalars $\in (0,\infty)$ . (ii) In $\mathbb{C}[x]$ , $x$ is always irreducible, $x^2$ is never irreducible. Question 1: Is it possible to somehow characterize all always irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ ? Question 2: Is there a way to distinguish between always irreducibles and infinitely irreducibles? Examples of always irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ are: (a) $\lambda x- \mu$ , where $\lambda,\mu \in \mathbb{C}$ . (b) $\lambda y- \mu$ , where $\lambda,\mu \in \mathbb{C}$ . (c) $\lambda x + H(y)$ , where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ , $H(y) \in \mathbb{C}[y]$ . (d) $\lambda y + H(x)$ , where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ , $H(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ . Actually, (c) includes (a) and (d) includes (b) .
If I am not wrong, (c) and (d) can be proved by Eisenstein's criterion . One has to be careful, for example $x+y^2$ , in wikipedia's notations we should take $p=x$ not $p=y$ . (e) By the fourth answer to this question, $f=g(x)-h(y)$ is irreducible when $\gcd(\deg(g),\deg(h))=1$ ; in particular, taking $g$ linear yields (c) , and taking $h$ linear yields (d) . If I am not wrong, in $k[x,y]$ : If $(f,g)$ is an automorphic pair ,
then $f$ (and $g$ ) is always irreducible, where $(f,g)$ is an automorphic pair if $k[x,y]=k[f,g]$ or, equivalently, if $(x,y) \mapsto (f,g)$ is an automorphism of $k[x,y]$ . Moreover, if $(f,g)$ is a Jacobian pair ,
then $f$ (and $g$ ) is always irreducible, where $(f,g)$ is a Jacobian pair if $\operatorname{Jac}(f,g):=f_xg_y-f_yg_x$ belongs to $k-\{0\}$ .
Indeed, $\frac{k[x,y]}{\langle f \rangle}$ is an integral domain (I can add an argument for this later), so $\langle f \rangle$ is a prime ideal, hence by the second link below, $f$ is irreducible. Repeat this argument for $f + \lambda$ for every $\lambda \in k$ , and get that $f + \lambda$ is irreducible for every $\lambda \in k$ .

The proof of this fact uses the existence of an ample symmetric divisor on these varieties, which are projective. Is this statement also true in general for abelian schemes, which may not be projective ? I know that it is true for elliptic curves (as schemes), as it is proved in Katz and Mazur's book. However, the proof also makes use of the projectivity of such curves and their concrete description in terms of a Weierstraß equation. For reference, an abelian scheme $X$ over a base scheme $S$ is a smooth proper $S$ -group scheme with geometrically connected fibers. A homomorphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ (as $S$ -group schemes) of abelian schemes is an isogeny if it is surjective with a finite kernel.

The geodesic submanifold defined by a tangent vector $v\in T_pM$ is $\exp_p(B)$ where $B\ni0$ is a small ball in $\operatorname{span}(v)^\perp\subset T_pM$ , so small that $\exp_p|_B$ is an embedding. Let $\gamma(t):=\exp_p(tv)$ . We consider points focal to the geodesic submanifold defined by $v$ along the geodesic $\gamma$ . In the book there is a Rauch II, i.e., second Rauch comparison, which requires the geodesic to have no focal points in the above sense. Question. Let $c:[0,\ell]\to M$ be a geodesic and $E$ a parallel field along $c$ orthogonal to $c'$ . Does there exist an $\varepsilon>0$ such that for all $t\in[0,\ell]$ , the there are no points on the geodesic $$\gamma_t:[0,\varepsilon]\to M,s\mapsto\exp_{c(t)}(sE(t))$$ that is focal to the geodesic submanifold defined by $E(t)$ along $\gamma_t$ ? This seems to be implicitly assumed in the proof of a lemma for the Cheeger–Gromoll soul theorem. However, I don't see why this is true. The existence of such a focal point is equivalent to having a critical point of some restriction of $\exp$ , but for each $t$ the restrictions are different and don't seem to be related. So I don't know how to make the $\varepsilon$ uniform with respect to $t$ . Any help is deeply appreciated! Edit: It seems that the notion of focal points is not so well-known. Here it is in the sense as in, e.g., Morse Theory by Milnor. Let $N$ be a submanifold, $\gamma$ a unit-speed geodesic with $\gamma(0)\in N$ , $\gamma'(0)\perp T_{\gamma(0)}N$ . Let $T^\perp N\subset TM$ be the normal bundle of $N$ . A point $\gamma(a)$ is said to be focal to $N$ along $\gamma$ if $\exp_p|_{T^\perp N}:T^\perp N\to M$ is singular at $a\gamma'(0)$ (note that $\exp(a\gamma'(0))=\gamma(a)$ ). In particular, when $N$ is a single point this reduces to the usual notion of conjugate points along a geodesic.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3542327,How to show that the Billiard flow is invariant with respect to the area form $\sin(\alpha)d\alpha\wedge dt$,"Consider a plane billiard table $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (i.e. a bounded open connected set) with smooth boundary $\gamma$ being a closed curve. Next, let $M$ denote the space of tangent unit vectors $(x,v)$ with $x$ on $\gamma$ and $v$ being a unit vector pointing inwards. We then define the billiard map $$
T : M \to M.
$$ To understand the map $T$ , we consider a point mass traveling from $x$ in direction $v$ . Let $x_1$ be the first point on $\gamma$ that this point mass intersects and suppose that $v_1$ is the new direction of the mass upon incidence. Then $T$ maps $(x,v)$ to $(x_1, v_1)$ . We now introduce an alternate ''coordinate system'' describing $M$ . Parametrize $\gamma$ by arc-length $t$ and fix a point $(x,v) \in M$ . We can find $t$ such that $x = \gamma(t)$ and let $\alpha \in (0, \pi)$ be the angle between the tangent line at $x$ and $v$ . The tuple $(t, \alpha)$ uniquely determines the point $(x,v)$ in $M$ , and thus offers and alternative description of this space. My question is as follows: I want to show that the area form given by $$
\omega := \sin{\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}t
$$ is invariant under $T$ . I found a proof of this invariance property proof in S. Tabachnikov's Geometry and billiards but I'm having some trouble understanding a critical part of the proof. If anyone can explain the proof to me (or provide me with another proof) I would highly appreciate it. An intuitive explanation is also appreciated, but I am looking for a rigorous proof if possible. We restate this theorem formally below and provide the proof as given by Tabachnikov. Theorem 3.1. The area form $ω = \sin α \,dα \wedge dt$ is $T$ -invariant. Proof . Define $f(t, t_1)$ to be the distance between $\gamma(t)$ and $\gamma(t_1)$ . The partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial{t_1}}$ is the projection of the gradient of the distance $\left\vert{\gamma(t)\gamma(t_1)}\right\vert$ on the curve at point $\gamma(t_1)$ . This gradient is the unit vector from $\gamma(t)$ to $\gamma(t_1)$ and it makes angle $\alpha_1$ with the curve; hence $\partial f/\partial t_1 = \cos{\alpha_1}$ . Likewise, $\partial f/\partial t = -\cos{\alpha}$ . Therefore, $$
  \mathrm{d}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \mathrm{d}t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t_1}\mathrm{d}t_1
= -\cos{\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}t + \cos{\alpha_1}\,\mathrm{d}t_1
$$ and hence $$
0 = \mathrm{d}^2f = \sin{\alpha}\mathrm{d}\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}t - \sin{\alpha_1} \mathrm{d}\alpha_1 \wedge \mathrm{d}t_1.
$$ This means that $\omega$ is a $T$ -invariant form. The above proof is copied directly from the book. I have the following questions about his method: Is the domain of $f$ the set $M\times M$ ? In the proof, are we specifically considering $(t, \alpha)$ and $(t_1, \alpha_1)$ such that $T (t, \alpha) =(t_1,\alpha_1)$ ? I am having a hard time understanding how the author obtains $\partial f/\partial t_1 = \cos{\alpha_1}$ and $\partial f/\partial t = -\cos{\alpha}$ .

I wonder if distribution theory can be used to tackle PDEs with boundary conditions. To be more specific, let's consider this problem. Let there be a string of length $\pi$ with both ends fixed. Transverse waves can be produced on the string, satisfying the classical wave equation $$
\partial^2_t u(x,t)=c^2\partial^2_x u(x,t).
$$ The boundary conditions are $u(0)=u(\pi)=0$ . Now, let impose a wired initial condition: let's pluck the string in the middle, so initially, the string is at rest, in the position $$
u(x,0)=A(\pi/2-|x-\pi/2|), A\in \mathbb R.
$$ As one can see, the initial condition is not everywhere differentiable. However, $u$ can be seen as an element of $\mathcal D'(\mathbb R)$ or $\mathcal S'(\mathbb R)$ , the space of (tempered) distributions. The differential equation therefore make sense in the sense of distributions. Using Fourier transform and convolution, we can manage to get a solution, IF there are no boundary conditions. However, in this situation, I do not know how to state the boundary condition in term of distributions. So, my question now is: can we make sense out of this problem, possibly in the sense of distributions, and solve the equation? Edit: we can use Fourier series expansion to solve this, but then I don't feel it really a way of ""understanding"" how it really works - after all, the original equation ceases to make sense when it is not differentiable. I want to somehow have some formalism in making sense of the derivative of a function which is not differentiable. Possibly weak derivative?

I want to prove that the sheaf of ideals of $Y$ , which is the kernel of $O_X \to \iota_* O_Y$ is quasi-coherent. I know that the kernel of quasi-coherent sheaves is quasi-coherent and the structure sheaf $O_X$ is quasi-coherent. It remains to show that $\iota_* O_Y$ is quasi-coherent. Any explanation about this last point would be appreciated. Thank you!","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
3542562,Expected winning of a player with highest lowest and second highest lowest grouping,"The following is an interview question. Question:     Given 4 players $A,B,C,D$ and a fair $50$ -sided dice, assume that we do not allow repeated score (i.e. next player cannot get the same score as all previous players. Otherwise, the player roll again). We group players with the highest and lowest scores together and second and third highest together. The winning team is the group that has the larger sum which will win the difference between team score. For example, say $A,B$ and $C,D$ form 2 groups and $A=1,B=7,C=3,D=2,$ then $A,B$ groups wins with $8-5=3$ units. What number should player $A$ hopes to get to maximize his expected winning?

3542681,Does uniformly bounded sequence in Lp which converges almost everywhere converge in norm?,"I'm trying to solve problem $17$ from chapter $6$ of Royden's Real Analysis. The problem is - Let $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of functions in $L^p([0,1]), p\in(1,\infty)$ , which converge almost everywhere to some $f\in L^p$ . Suppose that there is a constant $M$ s.t $||f_n||_p\leq M$ for all $n$ . Then for each $g\in L^q$ (where $\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{p}=1$ ) we have - $\int fg=lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int f_ng$ I want to solve this problem using the Riesz representation theorem for $L^p$ spaces, which states that any bounded linear functional in $(L^p)^*=L^q$ is of the form - $\phi _g (h)=\int hg$ , where $g\in L^q$ . Since $g$ corresponds to a bounded (and thus continuous) linear functional, the problem is basically solved, if I prove that $f_n\rightarrow f$ in norm. But I'm not sure that this is the case. I know that generally, $f_n\rightarrow f$ almost everywhere does not imply convergence in norm. But since $f_n$ are uniformly bounded in norm by $M$ , I'm hoping that I can somehow conclude that this is indeed the case (I know that if moreover $||f_n||_p\rightarrow ||f||_p$ then there actually is convergence in norm, maybe I can somehow use this fact?). Does anyone know if this it true and how to prove this? If not, can anyone suggest a different approach?

3542719,Showing $A= \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is not finitely generated and $A_\text{tor}=A$.,"(i) $A= \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ the additive Group and I want to show first that $A_\text{tor}=\{a\in A:\text{ord}(a)<\infty \}=A$ . $q\in \mathbb{Q} \Rightarrow q=\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, b\neq 0$ . Now : $q+\mathbb{Z} = \frac{a}{b} +\mathbb{Z}$ . But $b\cdot (\frac{a}{b} +\mathbb{Z})=a+\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}$ what am I missing here? This seems far too easy. (ii) If $A=(a_1,...,a_n)$ then from (i) it follows that the order of $a_i<\infty$ , so there is a (if you want the smallest common multiple is enough) $k\in \mathbb{N}$ with $a_i^k=e, \, \forall a_i$ . This follows from the fact that $A= \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian and ord $(a_1\cdot...\cdot a_n) | \text{lcd}(a_1,...,a_n) $ But beause the ord $(\frac{1}{n}+\mathbb{Z})=n$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}, n\neq 0$ , the order of elements of in $A= \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ cannot have an upper barrier like $\text{lcd}(a_1,...,a_n)$ .

3542734,Alternatives for sigmoid curve starting from 0 with interpretable parameters,"I am looking for alternative of sigmoid curves going through $(0,0)$ , whose parameters can be sensed by eyeballing the function graph. As an example, consider this curve: $$f(x) = {{a x ^ b} \over 1 + a x ^ b}$$ Where $ a, b $ are meaningless parameters without any straightforward interpretation. However, we can write the curve equation in such a way that both parameters will be meaningful. Imagine new parameters $c, d$ such that: $$\begin{cases} f (c) = 0.1 \\ f (d) = 0.9 \end{cases}$$ Then expressing the curve with parameters a, b defined as follows, that is by parameters c, d, does the job. $$\displaystyle{a}={9}\cdot{d}^{{-{b}}}$$ $$\displaystyle{b}=\frac{{-{4}\cdot \log{{\left({3}\right)}}}}{ \log{{\left(\frac{c}{{d}}\right)}}}$$ So looking at the example below, we can easily guess the values of parameters c, d. The function is in 10% and 90% value in approximately $x=1$ (parameter c) and $x=3$ (parameter d). Job done. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fmalvakguo Why I ask for alternatives? The curve equation lacks ""symmetry."" I do not ask for exact symmetry but what I mean is that the function above $f(d)=0.9$ approaches asymptote of 1 very slowly. While below $f(c)=0.1$ the function gets to zero quite quickly.","['curves', 'functions', 'logistic-regression']"
3542832,are $T_{b-a}$ and $T_b - T_a$ equal in distribution?,"let $u > 0$ , $b > a > 0$ and $T_u = \inf \{t \geq0 \,|\, B_t = u\}$ where $B$ is a standard Brownian motion. I was reading some lecture notes and noticed that the author treats $T_{b-a}$ and $T_b - T_a$ as identical in distribution. intuitively I can see why this is the case, but in a previous problem, when $a$ was negative such that $a < 0 < b$ it was proven that $$\mathbb{\mathbb{P}}(T_b - T_a < 0) = -\frac{a}{b-a}$$ but in this case $$\mathbb{\mathbb{P}}(T_{b-a} < 0) = \mathbb{\mathbb{P}}(T_{b-a} - T_{0} < 0) = 0$$ so are $T_{b-a}$ and $T_b - T_a$ actually equal in distribution ? if so how come the sign of $a$ has such an influence on the distribution of $T_{b-a}$ ?","['martingales', 'stopping-times', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory']"

It is obvious that $|\varphi(x)|\leq \alpha\|x\| \leq \alpha  \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\varphi_j(x)|$ for some $\alpha$ .

3542882,Semidirect product action and its geometry,"I'm going by the maxim Groups, like men, are known by their actions This naturally leads one to ask ""given groups $G, H$ which act on sets $S, T$ and the semidirect product $G \rtimes H$ , how does one visualize the action of $G \rtimes H$ ? What does it act on? Some combination of $S$ and $T$ ? ( $S \times T$ perhaps?) I know some elementary examples, likr $D_n \simeq \mathbb Z_n \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ . However, given an unknown situation, I am sure I cannot identify whether it is a semidirect product that is governing the symmetry. The best responses on similar questions like intuition about semidirect product tend to refer to this as some kind of ""direct product with a twist "". This is shoving too much under the rug: the twist is precisely the point that's hard to visualize. Plus, not all ""twists"" are allowed --- only certain very constrained types of actions turn out to be semidirect product. I can justify the statement by noting that: the space group of a crystal splits as a semidirect product iff the space group is symmorphic --- this is quite a strong rigidity condition on the set of all space groups. The closest answer that I have found to my liking was this one about discrete gauge theories on physics.se , where the answer mentions: If the physical space is the space of orbits of $X$ under an action $H$ . Ie, the physical space is $P \equiv X / H$ . Then, if this space $P$ is acted upon by $G$ . to extend this action of $G \rtimes H$ onto $X$ we need a connection . This seems to imply that the existence of a semidirect product relates to the ability to consider the space modulo some action, and then some action per fiber . I feel that this also somehow relates to the short exact sequence story(though I don't know exact sequences well): Let $1 \rightarrow K \xrightarrow{f}G \xrightarrow{g}Q \rightarrow 1$ be a short exact sequence. Suppose there exists a homomorphism $s: Q \rightarrow G$ such that $g \circ s = 1_Q$ . Then $G = im(f) \rtimes im(s)$ . ( Link to theorem ) However, this is still to vague for my taste. Is there some way to make this more rigorous / geometric? Visual examples would be greatly appreciated.","['semidirect-product', 'group-theory', 'group-actions', 'exact-sequence']"
