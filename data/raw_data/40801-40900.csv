402081,"Why is $\langle \operatorname{grad} f, X\rangle_g$ independent of the metric on a Riemannian manifold?","Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and let $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$. Let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$. In smooth local coordinates $(x^i)$ on $M$, we can write $g = g_{ij} dx^i \otimes dx^j$ as well as $X = X^i \partial_{x^i}$. Now I have computed that $\langle\operatorname{grad} f, X \rangle_g =  X^i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$ as follows. If we let $g^{ij}$ be the inverse matrix of $g_{ij}$ We have
$$\begin{eqnarray*} \langle\operatorname{grad} f, X \rangle_g &=&  \left\langle g^{ij} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\partial_{x^j} , X^k\partial_{x^k} \right\rangle_g\\
&=& g^{ij} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}X^k\left\langle \partial_{x^j},\partial_{x^k} \right\rangle_g\\
&=& g_{jk}g^{ij}  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}X^k \\
&=& g_{kj}g^{ji}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}X^k \hspace{1cm} (\text{by using that $g_{ij}$ is a symmetric matrix})\\
&=& X^i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}. \end{eqnarray*}$$ My question is: Is there any geometric reason as to why $\langle \operatorname{grad} f, X \rangle_g$ should be independent of the metric $g$?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

402092,Recovering random variable from its moments,"The problem is: can you recover a distribution of random variable if you know all its moments? My first guess was to use moment-generating function (MGF). It is known that if two random variables have the same MGF, then they have equal distributions. So if $M(X) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb{E} X^n \frac{t^n}{n!}$ converges, then it uniquely corresponds to some distribution; we can apply inverse Laplace transform and get the PDF of X, which solves the problem.
But there are some issues: MGF may not exist. Even if MGF exists, the approach with Laplace transform works only with continuous random variables. Can you help me with this problem? Thank you!",['probability']

Triangle 2 has sides of  $1$, $w$, a hypotenuse of $u$, and an angle $t$ such that $\cos t=\dfrac{1}{u}$. Now we want $\cot(t)+\dfrac1u=1$, or $\cot(t)+\cos(t)=1$.

However, I have not learned statistics and have only learned elementary probability. Does there exist a book or monograph that introduces probability and statistics at this level and still covers frequentist and bayesian views (philosophy?) in a balanced manner? It appears to me (but please correct me if I am wrong -- as I have stated I haven't learned this yet) that introductions at this level usually fully adopt a frequentist view and don't really broach the subject. On the other hand, bayesian books appear to be pitched to a more experienced audience and/or are perhaps even more unbalanced, in the sense that they seem anti-frequentist as much as pro-bayesian. To more fully describe my mathematical maturity, I am comfortable with the normal calculus sequence (although somewhat rusty), basic linear algebra, basic set theory, mathematical logic, computability theory, some abstract algebra, very little category theory. I am comfortable with the level of introductory analysis, but have not completed it, and I am not versed in measure theory (I expect I could handle measure theory, but knowledge of it shouldn't be assumed).

402210,Probability $k$ bins are non-empty,"The following problem arises in the analysis of Bloom filters . Consider $m$ bins and $N=nk$ balls placed uniformly and independently at random into the bins. A query chooses $k$ bins uniformly and independently at random and asks if they are all non-empty.  The main question is as follows. What is the probability that all $k$ bins in the query are non-empty? It is assumed that this probability will be a function of $k$, $m$ and $n$. The second question is: For what value of $k$ (which is a function of $m$ and $n$) is this probability minimized? The standard version of the analysis taught the world over and reproduced in the wikipedia page linked above contains a ""now the magic occurs"" step which ignores the non-independence of the bins. It gives $k \approx \frac{m}{n} \ln{2}$ as the answer to the second question. Is there a clean and rigorous way of doing this analysis correctly? This is a repost of this one which hasn't had any good answers yet. Clarification. The difficultly arises because the probability that all $k$ bins are non-empty is not $(1-(1-\frac{1}{m})^{kn})^k$. The reason is that the probability that one of the $k$ (not necessarily distinct) bins that is queried is non-empty is dependent on whether the other queries return non-empty bins. An approximate answer or good bounds will suffice.","['balls-in-bins', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

Is it correct to assume that a vector (in a 2-dimensional space) $v = [1,1]$ could be represented as an arrow from the origin $[0,0]$ to the point $[1,1]$? If the above assumption is correct, what does it mean in the physics representation to normalize a vector? If I have a vector $[1,1]$, would the vector $[-1,1]$ be orthogonal to that first vector?

402393,Question regarding the proof of a topological claim,"The lecturer in the Topology course I'm taking defined the following:
Given a topological space $X$
  we say that: $X$ is weakly locally compact if for all $x\in X$
there exists a compact nbhd. $X$ is strongly locally compact if every nbhd of $x$
contains a compact nbhd of $x$
. We then made the following claim: A weakly locally compact (wlc) Hausdorff space is strongly locally compact. Briefly the proof went as follows: Given $U$ a nbhd of $x\in X$  since $X$ is wlc there is a compact nbhd of $x$
, $C\subseteq X$. Since $U,C$
are both nbhds of $x$ then $U\cap C$
is also a nbhd of $x$
and thus there is an open set $V\subseteq X$
such that $x\in V\subseteq U\cap C$
. Since $C$
is a compact Hausdorff space (Hausdorff being hereditary) we know $C$
is regular. Since regularity is hereditary and $V\subseteq C$
we know $V$
is also regular and thus there is an open set $W\subseteq V$
such that $x\in W\subseteq\overline{W}\subseteq V\subseteq C$ . Since $C$
is compact and $\overline{W}$
is closed in $C$
we know that $\overline{W}$
is also compact. Finally $x\in W\subseteq\overline{W}\subseteq V\subseteq U$
and thus $\overline{W}$
is a compact nbhd of $x$
contained in $U$ . The lecturer then noted that it's important to notice the proof hangs on the fact that the closure of $W$ in $V$ and $C$ is the same. That is since we can only deduce compactness of $\overline{W}$ since it is closed in $C$. However, we used the regularity of $V$ in order to find $W$ and thus the closure of $W$ is relative to the topology in $V$ and not in $C$. He also noted that in fact from the way we carried out the construction the closure of $W$ is the same in all the groups in which it is contained, that is $\overline{W}_{X}=\overline{W}_{C}=\overline{W}_{U}=\overline{W}_{V}$
  (the substring marking closure relative to which space). My question is why is it in fact true that $\overline{W}_{X}=\overline{W}_{C}=\overline{W}_{U}=\overline{W}_{V}$ ?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

402426,"Is pi lying on the ground, and on TV? - and on the sun?","Consider the leaves from a bunch of trees in a terraced plaza in the Autumn. It may well happen that the tiles of the terrace are squares whose length easily exceeds the length of the stem of the leaves (assuming leaves all of the same kind). Cannot this be regarded as a Buffon process? That is, if you took a photograph of it and counted the line crossing of the leaf-stems with the lines determined by the tiles, you would get Buffon's calculation for pi. Furthermore, you could do this even in the absence of the tiles, simply by imposing an appropriate tiling over the photograph later, right? And if we can impose a tiling later, what about imposing it on a TV program, with respect to some recurring object? Would that, properly done, not constitute a Buffon process as well? edit: It might apply to sunspots as well, because sunspots, during solar min, typically have low latitudes, i.e., they  occur near the equator of the sun, which can be considered as approximately a flat surface, and each sunspot approximates a highly non-smooth Jordan curve, which therefore almost always is going to have a unique greatest diameter, which can be considered as the needle. Sunspots vary greatly in size, so we could restrict our attention to ones of a given size (most likely the smaller ones, so as to maximize the number of sunspots considered), and then consider the circles of latitude, starting at the equator, separated by a distance a little bit greater than the needle length (perhaps, such that the needle length is 5/6 that of the circle separations, in imitation of what Mario Lazzarini did in 1901.) Of course, since we’re considering solar min, we might want to consider all sunspots over, say, a 22-year period, so as to get a lot of data points (trial tosses of the needle). So, how good an approximation to pi would be get? – and is there any correlation between how good an approximation we get and certain solar events such as flares?",['statistics']

402489,Sum separable partial differential equation over general domain,"First off, thank you for taking your time out and considering my question. I just have a (rather) general question on partial differential equations. So consider the following. Let $(x,y) \mapsto u(x,y)$ be some sufficiently smooth real-valued function over a rather general domain $\mathcal{F} \subset R^2$. And using subscripts to denote partial differentiation, suppose that, 
$$
u_x(x,y) = g_1(x) \\
u_y(x,y) = g_2(y)  
$$
In particular, note that $g_1$ is only a function of $x$ and $g_2$ is only a function of $y$. Now, if the domain $\mathcal{F}$ were rectangular in the form $[a,b] \times [c,d]$, then using the usual fundamental theorem of calculus, we would obtain $u(x,y) = \int_a^x g_1(\eta)d\eta + \int_c^y g_2(\eta) d\eta$. But what about the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is rather general? That is, it could be connected, simply-connected, etc.? I can still see how $u(x,y)$ would have a similar separably additive form as above, but what about the region of integration? That is, do we have to consider, for each point $(x,y) \in \mathcal{F}$, the $x$-section $\mathcal{F}_y$ and $y$-section $\mathcal{F}_x$ of the domain $\mathcal{F}$ and integrate? Would it have the form like, 
$$
u(x,y)
= \int_{\mathcal{F}_y} g_1(\eta) d\eta + \int_{\mathcal{F}_x} g_2(\eta) d\eta
$$
(and plus some constant of integration if it needs be)? And if it is indeed this form, to recover back the partial derivatives, we can't use the typical fundamental theorem of calculus, but we need to consider the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, correct? Any help would be highly appreciated! Thank you! PS. I'm aware that such sum-separable differential form can, via some change of variables, be rewritten into the wave equation. However, the traditional wave equation in $(t,x)$ where $x \in R^1$ allows for a very general consideration in the spatial coordinate $x$ but usually takes the time coordinate $t$ to be only the positive real line.

Basically what I've got is a sort of semi-rigorous (and probably incorrect) proof of the equality, but maybe somebody could help me flesh out the details. Proof: Beginning from the definition that $E[X]:=\int_{\Omega}X\;dP$. Given a random variable $X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we have the induced measure on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathscr{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ given by $P(\{X\in A\})$.  Then by the Radon-Nikodym theorem there exists a measurable function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ such that $$P(\{X\in A\}) = \int_Afd\mu,$$ where $d\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.  From here it gets a bit hand-wavy.  Basically since this measure was induced by the random variable $X$, then on $\mathbb{R}$ this random variable is simply given by the identity function $g(x)=x$.  And thus by definition we write the expected value of $g$ with respect to our Radon-Nikodym produced measure in the form $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\;d\Big(\int_Afd\mu\Big).$$ Now by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, this becomes $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)\;dx.$$ What does everyone think about this?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'expected-value', 'faq']"

Then there exists a measurable function $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)\le \alpha$ if $x\in E_\alpha$ and $f(x)\ge \alpha$ if $x\notin E_\alpha$.

If $n-1=2^xc$ or $n+1=2^xc$ for some $x\in\Bbb{N}^{>0}$, then $n$ is prime. For example, using $n=41$: The period of $1/41=0.0243902439\dots$ is $5$ and $5$ is a divisor of $41-1$, the ""cycle length of $41$"" is $10$, $(41-1)/10 = 4 = 2^2$, so $41$ is prime. Is there any counterexample to this? To define the ""cycle length of $n$"" (using $n=73$ as an example): Step 1 : 73 +  1 =  74. Get the odd part of  74, which is 37    
Step 2 : 73 + 37 = 110. Get the odd part of 110, which is 55
Step 3 : 73 + 55 = 128. Get the odd part of 128, which is  1 Continuing this operation (with $73 + 1$) repeats the same steps as above. There are $3$ steps in the cycle, so the cycle length of $73$ is $c=3$.","['elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

If we thought up some way to get rid of it, we'd have a nice geometric series and $e^{xy}$. But I can't think of a way...any leads here? 2: Alternatively, we could leave the $\frac{x^n}{n!}$ outside and treat it as a number (because it is, before we choose to sum it up over $n$). $$ c_n= \frac{x^n}{n!}\;\sum_{k=0}^n\frac {y^k}{k!} 1^{n-k}=\frac{x^n}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{ n- k}$$ which gives us $a_n=\frac{y^n}{n!}$ and $b_n=1$.

Here's a list of some of the other ideas I've tried, which don't seem to get me anywhere: Generalising the series - By this, I mean replacing the $-1$ for $z$ and then try and use the ratio test to see whether $-1$ is inside or outside or on the boundary of the circle of convergence - however, when I did so, I believe that the ratio test is inconclusive for all values of $|z|$, which while disappointing, is an interesting feature of the series. Summation by parts - While this is usually a nice tool to use for when dealing with awkward sums, I can't see any good choice of sequences $ (a_n) $ and $(b_n)$ to choose to use. Summing consecutive terms - By this, I mean evaluating the series by looking at the sum of $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{2k}}{2k(2+(-1)^{2k})} + \frac{(-1)^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)(2+(-1)^{2k-1})}$$ $$ \Rightarrow \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2k} - \frac{1}{3(2k-1)}$$ $\quad$ but then as we are left with parts of the harmonic series this doesn't seem like a nice way to  $\quad$evaluate it.

I want to show that $g_α$ has a Taylor expansion $g_α (x) = \sum_{k=0}^∞ \tbinom{α}{k}x^k$. I can easily show that the series really converges for $|x| < 1$, but can I use this fact to show that the remainder term
$$R_n(x) = \int_0^x \frac{(x-t)^n}{n!} (n+1)! \tbinom{α}{n+1}(1+t)^{α-n-1} dt$$

If $x > 0$, then $\big|\frac{x}{1+hx}\big| < {\big|\frac{x}{1+x}\big|}< 1$ and so for $q := \big|\frac{x}{1+x}\big|$, since $\sum_{k=0}^∞ \tbinom{α}{n} q^n$ converges:

$G$-bundle $p : EG \to BG$ where $EG$ is contractile, so that $BG = EG/G$. A classifying space is universal in the sense that if $q : E \to B$ is a principle $G$-bundle, then there is a
continuous map $B \rightarrow BG$, unique up to homotopy, such that $E$ is the fiber product $f^*EG$. Why this definition implies tha there is a one-to-one corrispondence between the isomorphism classes of $G$-bundle on a space $X$ (that I denote with $\mathcal{P}_G(X)$) and the homotopy classes of maps $X \to BG$ ([X,BG])? In practice, how can I show that
$$ [\mathcal{P}_G(X)] \simeq [X,BG] $$","['geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'principal-bundles', 'algebraic-topology']"

403003,"Relationship between Turing bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, and Hopf bifurcation?","Quoting from http://jxshix.people.wm.edu/2009-harbin-course/mississippi-bifurcation-2.pdf a Turing bifurcation occurs when for an ODE and related PDE $u' = f(u,v), v' = g(u,v)$ $u_t = d_1 \nabla u + f(u,v), v_t = d_2 \nabla v + g(u,v)$ a constant solution $u(x,t) = u_0, v(x,t) = v_0$ remains a stable steady state for the ODE and becomes an unstable steady state for the PDE. Stable steady states are generally destabilized either by one real eigenvalue (of the associated Jacobian matrix evaluated in the steady state) crossing the imaginary axis or by a pair of two complex eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis (i.e. the real part changes from negative to positive values). Generally, one real eigenvalue crossing the imaginary axis is called saddle-node bifurcation.
A pair of complex eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis is referred to as Hopf bifuraction. Are these two types of bifurcations exactly the ones that occur for the PDE (while the steady state remains stable for the ODE) in what is generally referred to as Turing bifurcation / Turing instability? If so, what are the qualitative differences, if any, between the patterns formed past the Turing bifurcation?","['bifurcation', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'mathematical-modeling', 'partial-differential-equations']"
403025,Equation with high exponents,"I would appreciate any help with this problem:

403031,Entire function $f$ such that $|f(z)| ≤ K |z|^3$ for $|z|\ge1$ and $f(z) = f(iz)$ for every $z∈C$,"Let $f(z)$ be an entire function such that for some constant $K$ , $|f(z)| ≤ K$ $|z|^3<$ for $|z|\ge1$ and $f(z) = f(iz)$ $∀z∈C$ , then which of the following are correct ? (A)$ f(z) = Kz^3$ $∀ z∈\Bbb{C}$ (B) $f(z)$ is a constant function (C) $f(z)$ is quadratic function (D) No such $f$ exists My attempt : I can deduce that since $f(z) = f(iz)$ and since $i^4=1 \implies f$ must involve only fourth powers of $z$ . Hence $f(z)=a_1z^4+b_1z^8+c_1z^{16}+ \cdots $-------(1) Also for $|z| \ge 1 $: let C. Then $|g(z)| = |f(z)|/|z^3| \le k$ => By the Cauchy estimate theorem we can prove that : 
$f(z)/z^3$ is a constant function $= c $ $\implies f(z)=cz^3$ for $|z| > 1$     ...........(2) From (1) and (2) ; we get  there does not exist a function like this ? My textbook answer says it's a constant function ?","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"
403049,Proving $f(x) := \sin(ax) - \sin(bx)$ has absolute value greater or equal to 1 for some $x>0$,"I am trying to prove that for any choice of reals $a$ and $b$  such that
$a \neq b $
the function $f(x) := \sin(ax) - \sin(bx)$ has $|f(x)| \geq 1$ for some $x>0$ (This is not an exercise question but something I am trying to prove for myself. Plots with Wolfram Alpha seem to indicate it might be true, and so counterexamples are very much welcome) Here is my attempt. 
For this I wrote $f$ of 3 variables $a,b,x$. We find that value of $x_0$ 
for which $f$ attains a maximum and minimum and then show that $|f(x_0)|$
greater than 1. $g(a,b,x)=f(x)$ and then zeroing the gradient. (pending the 2nd derivative test) $f_a = x \cos(ax)$ $f_b = -x \cos(bx)$ $f_x = a\cos(ax) - b\cos(bx)$ Since the point of minima/maxima are conjectured $x>0$ , this means $\cos(ax)$ and $\cos(bx)$ are both zero
and the third equation is redundant. If $a$ and $b$ are rational then obviously we can find such an $x$.
But when one of them is irrational, I don't know how I would prove this. Another attempt was using the $\sin(u)-\sin(v)$ product formula, but that 
led nowhere too. Any pointers?","['optimization', 'trigonometry']"
