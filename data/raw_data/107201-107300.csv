1529482,Calculating syzygies with Macaulay2,"I'm trying to calculate the syzygies of a set of elements on the polinomial ring of 6 variables. But I'm trying to specify the number of generator in each degree the syzygies have. I know that Macaulay2 can give me the syzygies of the sistem very fast, but it is returning some columns with mixed degree, and because of this I don`t know how to determinate how many generator of each degree I have. I thought in define the set of polynomials as a map, and find a resolution for the kernel of this map, but it seems that even with Macaulay2, if I go that way I will have  aplenty of calculations to do... My question is if that is any other faster way to solve this. Thanks in any advance.","['algebraic-geometry', 'macaulay2', 'modules', 'commutative-algebra']"

1529531,Applications of the completeness of $L^1$,"I'm teaching a measure theory class.  I think one of the main motivations for the development of the Lebesgue integral is that the space $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ of integrable functions on $\mathbb{R}$ is complete under the $L^1$ norm.  You can't get this if you stick to the Riemann integral. For further motivation, I would like to find some interesting applications of this fact; preferably elementary. For instance, is there some interesting function $f$ that one can construct by writing down a sequence of approximates $f_n$, showing that the sequence is $L^1$-Cauchy, and letting $f$ be its limit?  Ideally, it would not be obvious how to construct $f$ otherwise. I can think of lots of interesting applications of the completeness of $L^2$ (e.g. Fourier series) but not so much $L^1$.","['motivation', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1529549,Non-measurable sets and sigma-algebra definition,"I´m starting to study about measure theory, but I have problems regarding the definition of measure space. In my class we saw that there exists sets that are not measurable(Vitali sets in $\mathbb R$) and in order to avoid this problem we define  a sigma-algebra on a set $X$ and we call the elements of $\Sigma$ ""measurable sets"" But the problem I have is that how can we guarantee that with this ""definition"" we cannot construct a non-measurable set. Is there a theorem that says that there can´t be non-measurable sets on a sigma-algebra over $X$ with that definition? Or I just need to assume that we cannot find such sets over these circumstances?","['lebesgue-measure', 'terminology', 'soft-question', 'measure-theory']"
1529554,Why Does $f(x) = x\sqrt{x+3}$ Only Have One Critical Point?,"I am trying to find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x\sqrt{x+3}$, then by using the First Derivative Test, determine which ones are a local maximum, local minimum, or neither. Using the product rule, we get $\frac{3(x+2)}{2\sqrt{x+3}}$. So $x=-2$ is a critical point. But isn't $x=-3$ also a critical point because if $x=-3$ then the derivative of $f(x)$ wouldn't exist. To give an example of why I am thinking this, look at $g(x) = x^{2/3}(6-x)^{1/3}$. The derivative of $g(x)$ is $\frac{4-x}{x^{1/3}(6-x)^{2/3}}$, where $x$ cannot equal $0$ or $6$. The critical points for $g(x)$ are $0$, $6$, and $4$. So why aren't $-2$ and $-3$ the critical points for $f(x)$?","['fractions', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
1529564,Upper and lower derivatives at local minimum,"I've come across an exercise in Royden & Fitzpatrick that's got me a bit confused. It claims that if $c$ is the local minimizer for $f$ in $(a,b)$, then 
$$\underline{D} f(c) \leq 0 \leq \overline{D} f(c).$$ Here $\overline{D}f(x)=\lim\limits_{h \to 0}\left[\sup\limits_{0<|t|\leq h}\frac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t}\right]$ is the upper derivative, and $\underline{D}f(x)=\lim\limits_{h \to 0}\left[\inf\limits_{0<|t|\leq h}\frac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t}\right]$ is the lower derivative of f. Since $c$ is the local minimizer, for a small neighborhood around $c$, $f(c+t)-f(c)>0$ for any $t\in(0,h]$, so I do not see how I can ever get the lower derivative to be negative. No matter what value $t$ takes, it seems that $\frac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t}>0$.","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'derivatives']"
1529566,"How to tell who is the stronger chess player, for the purpose of fine tuning chess engines? [closed]","Closed. This question does not meet Mathematics Stack Exchange guidelines . It is not currently accepting answers. This question is not about mathematics, within the scope defined in the help center . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question This is a chess like question concerning how many games are required to tell who is the stronger player. The application is in fine tuning chess engines. It is typical that during this process a chess engine will play some games with a modified version of itself. After the tests the most successful engine is used as a baseline and it again plays a series of games with a modified version of itself. This is perhaps best described as an incremental approach to fine tuning. The problem is how many games do you have to play to have statistical valid data from the games when the engines may be very closely matched in ability? I had a stab at this using the score (1 point for a win, 0.5 points for a draw and 0 for a loss) and a Chi squared table with 3 degrees of freedom and calculating what was required. I came up with this (small excerpt): Games     95%*      97.5%*      99%*        99.5%*      99.9%*
5       4.5 / 0.5   - / -       - / -       - / -       - / -

12      9.0 / 3.0   9.5 / 2.5   10.0 / 2.0  10.5 / 1.5  11.5 / 0.5
* confidence level Which I intend to use like this: if I played 5 games and the result is 4.5 to 0.5 or better then I have 95% confidence I found the stronger engine. If I played 6 games and the result is 4.5 to 1.5 or worse then I cannot tell which is the stronger engine with 95% confidence. Have I done this the correct way? Should I have awarded 1 point for the draw also? Or used 2 degrees of freedom? Or a different approach altogether?","['probability', 'statistics']"

1529611,"Show that if a trapping region Q is path connected, the basin of Q must also be path connected","Consider a smooth bijection $F:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$. A trapping region is a bounded subset $Q$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the properties int$Q\neq \emptyset$, $F(Q)\subseteq Q$, and $F(Q)\neq Q$. The basin of $Q$ is defined to be the set of points in $\mathbb{R^2}$ such that $F^j(x)\in$int$Q$ for some $j\in\mathbb{N}$. The objective is to show that if $Q$ is path connected, the basin of $Q$ must also be path connected. Here is my attempt: Let $x_1,x_2\in \mbox{bas}Q$. Then, $\exists j_1,j_2\in\mathbb{N}$ such that  $F^{j_1}(x_1)\in \mbox{int}Q$ and $F^{j_2}(x_2)\in\mbox{int}Q$ by definition of basin. Let $j=\mbox{max}\{j_1,j_2\}$. Then, $F^j(x_1)\in \mbox{int}Q$ and $F^j(x_2)\in\mbox{int}Q$. Since $Q$ is path connected, there is a continuous path $s:[0,1]\rightarrow Q$ with $s(0)=F^j(x_1)$ and $s(1)=F^j(x_2)$. Since $F$ is a smooth bijection its inverse is continuous and thus $F^{-j}$ is also continuous. Furthermore, $F^{-j}\circ s: [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is continuous with $F^{-j}\circ s(0)=x_1$ and $F^{-j}\circ s(1)=x_2$ and thus a path from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are arbitrary in bas$Q$, bas$Q$ is path wise connected. A problem I am having is showing that the path defined by the composition of the inverse of $F^j$ with $s$ actually lies completely in bas$Q$. The path $s$ is only guaranteed to lie in $Q$, not necessarily int$Q$. Then, could it be that there is a point in the path $s$ which is in $Q$ but not bas$Q$?. Such a point would be in the path $F^{-j}\circ s$ and disqualify it as a connecting path.","['dynamical-systems', 'general-topology']"

It has some important properties. (a) $P(A^C)=1-P(A)$ (b) if $B\supseteq{A}$ then $P(B)=P(A)+P(B\setminus{A})\ge{P(A)}$ (c) $P(A\cup{B})=P(A)+P(B)-P({A}\cap{B})$ The proofs for (b) and (c) are not entirely clear to me. (b) $B={A}\cup({B}\setminus{A})$ . This is the union of disjoint sets and therefore, $P(B)=P(A)+P({B}\setminus{A})$ I get the above proof. Moving onto the proof for Lemma(c)... (c) $A\cup{B}=A\cup({B}\setminus{A})$ , which is a disjoint union. Therefore by (b), $P({A}\cup{B})=P(A)+P(B\setminus{A})=P(A)+P({B}\setminus({A}\cap{B}))=P(A)+P(B)-P({A}\cap{B})$ I don't get how (c) is being deduced.

1529955,"$c_0$, the space of sequences converging $0$ is complete with dual $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$","Let $c_0$ be the space of all complex sequences $(a_n)$ such that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} |a_n| =0$$  with norm $\|(a_n)\|_{c_0} = \sup_{n} |a_n|$. Is it fair to say that: Let $\{(a_n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a cauchy sequence in $c_0$. Let $\epsilon >0$. Then there exists $N$ such that for $n,m \geq N$, 
$$\|(a_n) - (a_m)\|_{c_0} = \sup_{k} |a_{n,k}-a_{m,k}| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}.$$
Let $n_0 \geq N$. Notice also that since $(a_{n_0}) \in c_0$, there exists $K$ such that, for $k \geq K$, $|a_{n_0,k}| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Therefore, define $(a) \in c_0$ as the sequence $a_k = a_{n_0,k}$ for $k < K$ and $a_k = 0$ for $k \geq K$. Then for $n_0$ as before and  $m \geq N$, $\|(a_m)-(a)\|_{c_0} \leq \|(a_m)-(a_{n_0}) \|_{c_0} +  \|(a_m)-(a_{n_0}) \|_{c_0} < \epsilon$. Thus, $\{(a_n)\}$ converges so $c_0$ is complete.  ? I was unsure about this proof since it seems that the cauchy sequence could converge to different limits, but I suppose in the uniform norm of $c_0$, the limits would only differ by $\epsilon$ so the limit is unique. Finally I need to show that $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$ is the dual space of $c_0$. Is it correct to say that, given $(x_n) \in \ell^1$, I want the action of $$(x_n) : c_0 \to \mathbb{C}$$ to be defined as $$(x_n): (a_n) \mapsto \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} x_n\overline{a_n}?$$ This clearly converges by comparison, and I'm left to show that all such linear functionals arise this way. It seems prudent to say that a linear functional on $(a_n) \in c_0$ can be determined by it's action on finite truncations of $(a_n)$, and therefore can be identified with some element in $$\operatorname{span}\{e_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$$ for $e_i$ the orthonormal hilbert basis for $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$.

Q: Does the sum $\frac{1}{X_1}+\frac{1}{X_1+X_2}+\frac{1}{X_1+X_2+X_3}+\dots=\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{X_1+\dots+X_k}$ converge a.s.? In other words, is it finite a.s.? Some remarks: 1. Some slick computations using the generating function of $X_i$ show that the expected value of the sum is $+\infty$, so it gives us no information. 2. For any fixed $i$, eventually every denominator $X_1+\dots+X_k$ becomes much larger than $X_i$. So convergence of the sum is independent of $X_i$ (more precisely of $(X_1,\dots,X_i)$ jointly)
and by Kolmogorov's 0-1 law either the sum converges a.s. or it diverges a.s. 3. Notice that $\mathbb{E}[X_i]=+\infty$, so by the strong law of large numbers (applied to suitable truncations of the $X_i$'s) we have $\frac{X_1+\dots+X_k}{k}\to +\infty$ a.s. So, if we rewrite our series as $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k}\left(\frac{X_1+\dots+X_k}{k}\right)^{-1}$, we can conclude that it grows slower than the harmonic series. 4. Easy estimates show that the problem is equivalent to the convergence of $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{t_1^{-1}+\dots+t_k^{-1}}$, where $(t_i)_{i\ge 1}$ is a sequence of independent uniform random variables on $(0,1)$. 5. If we use the $t_i's$, we can rewrite the sum as $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k} HM(t_1,\dots,t_k)$, where $HM$ denotes the harmonic mean.
The inequality $HM\le GM$ ($GM$ is the geometric mean) does not help, since by the strong law of large numbers we get $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k} GM(t_1,\dots,t_k)\sim\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\alpha}{k}=+\infty$ where $\alpha:=\exp\left(\int_0^1 \log t\,dt\right)=\frac{1}{e}$.

Then the ring $\mathcal R$ generated by $\mathcal H$ (i.e. the smallest ring in $\mathcal P(X)$ containing $\mathcal H$), is given by 
$\mathcal R = \{\bigcup^n_{i=1} A_i: n \in \mathbb N, A_1,...,A_n \in \mathcal H \text{ disjoint}\}$.
I wonder why we cannot give an analog explicit description of the $\sigma$-ring(closed under countable unions, not only finite) generated by $\mathcal H$. My guess would be $\mathcal R = \{\bigcup^\infty_{i=1} A_i, A_i \in \mathcal H \text{ disjoint}\}$, i.e. allow countable infinite unions too. I tried to see where the proof in the case of rings doesnt go through to the case of $\sigma$-rings. For example, to show that the $\sigma$-ring generated by $\mathcal H$ is contained in $\mathcal R$, one shows that $\mathcal R$ is a $\sigma$-ring. Let $\{A_t\}_t$ be a countable collection of elements in $\mathcal R$. Then by the usual trick one could write $\bigcup_t A_t = \bigcup_t (A_t\setminus(\bigcup^{t-1}_{s=1} A_s)$ as disjoint union. So it is left to show that $\mathcal R$ is closed under finite unions and set differences. The problem lies here: to show closure under set differences one would need that $\mathcal H$ is closed under taking countable intersections. Which leads to the (probably not fruitful) question if it makes sense to define a class of semirings with this stronger property. Finally, even though the semi-ring of half-open intervals is not stable under countable intersections, for example the set of all closed intervals is, and this as well generates the Borel-sigma algebra of $\mathbb R$, but the closed intervals are not a semi-ring. The Borel-sigma algebra is generated by many different systems of sets. Does the above exclude the possibility that a generating system is a semi-ring that at the same time is stable under countable intersection? Finally, why is an 'explicit description' of the sigma-algebra in terms of 'countable set operations' impossible?","['elementary-set-theory', 'measure-theory']"

Assume $d \omega = 0$ and show that $\omega$ is exact in $E$, by completing the following outline: Fix $p \in E$, Define $$f(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\bf [p,x]} \omega $$ and apply Stokes' theorem to affine-oriented 2-simplexes $\bf[p, x, y]$ in E. Deduce that \begin{equation}
f(\mathbf y) - f(\mathbf x) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i) \int_0^1 a_i((1-t) \mathbf x + t \mathbf y)\,dt
\end{equation} for $\mathbf x \in E, \mathbf y \in E$. Hence $(D_i f)(\mathbf x) = a_i(\mathbf x)$. The boundary of $\bf[p, x, y]$ is $\bf [x, y] - [p, y] + [p, x]$, from which $$f(\mathbf y) - f(\mathbf x) = \int_{\bf [x,y]} \omega= \int_{\bf [x,y]} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i(\mathbf x) \, dx_i$$ follows. Next take $\gamma(t) = (1-t) \mathbf x + t \mathbf y$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$. This is a $1$-surface. By differentiation of $1$-forms, we have $$\int_\gamma \omega = \int_{\bf [x, y]} \omega = \int_0^1 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i((1-t) \mathbf x + t \mathbf y)(y_i - x_i) \, dt$$ which is the same as what Rudin gives. At this point I'm not sure what to do. I suppose I should partially differentiate both sides with respect to one of the basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, but I'm not sure how to go forth with that. Edit. I have followed JohnMa's advice and here is the rest of the solution (for verification and archival purposes): Fix any $\mathbf x$ and and take $\mathbf y = \mathbf x + v \mathbf e_k$. Then 
$$
f(\mathbf x + v \mathbf e_k) - f(\mathbf x) = v \int_0^1 a_k ((1-t) \mathbf x + t (\mathbf x + v \mathbf e_k))\, dt = v \int_0^1 a_k(\mathbf x + tv \mathbf e_k) \, dt
$$
Dividing by $v$ and taking $v \to 0$ gives
$$
(D_k f)(\mathbf x) = a_k (\mathbf x)
$$
since $a_k$ is continuous. Since $\mathbf{x}$ was arbitrary, we have $D_k f = a_k$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$, hence $$\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n (D_i f)(\mathbf x) \, dx_i = d f$$ Since $f$ is a $0$-form.","['differential-forms', 'real-analysis']"

1531054,Counterfeit Coin Problem - 8 Coins,"How many weighings of a balance are necessary to determine if a coin is counterfeit among eight coins. The counterfeit coin is either heavier or lighter than the other coins. I understand the reasoning behind this problem when you know how the weight of the counterfeit coin compares to the rest of the pile, but I can not think of how to show that this problem takes 3 weighings. What I have so far is that say you have the coins $A B C D E F G H$, weigh $ABC$ against $DEF$ if they are equal then weigh $A$ against $G$ if these are equal then the counterfeit coin is coin $H$ if these two are unbalanced then $G$ is the counterfeit coin. Now this is where I hit the wall. When the piles of $ABC$ and $DEF$ are unbalanced you know that $G$ and $H$ are not counterfeit. I think you can now weigh $DA$ vs $BC$ and in the case where $DA$ and $BC$ equal you know that $E$ or $F$ is the counterfeit coin, which can be determined with one more weighing.

1531251,If $|G| = 120$ then $G$ has a subgroup of index $3$ or $5$ (or both),"This is exercise 1.C.4 in Isaacs, Finite Group Theory . I think I have a proof, but would like to verify the proof and also inquire whether it can be shortened or improved significantly. Let $|G| = 120 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$. Show that $G$ has a subgroup of index $3$ or a subgroup of index $5$ (or both). Hint: Analyze separately the possibilities for $n_2(G)$. My proof: By the Sylow theorems, $n_2(G)$ must be an odd integer which divides $15$, so $n_2(G) = 1$, $3$, $5$, or $15$. Case 1: $n_2(G) = 1$. In this case, $G$ has a unique (hence normal) Sylow $2$-subgroup $S$ of order $8$ (index $15$). Then $G/S$ is a group of order $15$, so it has subgroups of order $3$ and $5$ (index $5$ and $3$, respectively). By the correspondence theorem, these subgroups of $G/S$ correspond to subgroups of $G$ which contain $S$ and which have the same indices $5$ and $3$. Case 2: $n_2(G) = 3$. Since $n_2(G) = |G:N_G(S)|$ where $S \in Syl_2(G)$, the subgroup $N_G(S)$ has index $3$. Case 3: $n_2(G) = 5$. Then as in case 2, the normalizer of any Sylow $2$-subgroup has index $5$. Case 4: $n_2(G) = 15$. Here, I use the following theorem, proved earlier in the chapter. Suppose that $G$ is a finite group such that $n_p(G) > 1$, and choose distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups $S$ and $T$ of $G$ such that the order of $|S \cap T|$ is as large as possible. Then $n_p(G) \equiv 1$ mod $|S:S \cap T|$. Since $n_2(G) = 15$ is not congruent to $1$ mod $8$ or mod $4$, this theorem implies that there are $S,T \in Syl_2(G)$ such that $|S:S \cap T| = 2$, i.e. $|S \cap T| = 4$. Therefore $S\cap T \lhd S$ and $S \cap T \lhd T$, which means that $S \leq N_G(S\cap T)$ and $T \leq N_G(S\cap T)$. We write $H = N_G(S \cap T)$ for brevity. Note that $n_2(H) \equiv 1$ mod $2$, and we have $S,T \in Syl_2(H)$, so in fact $n_2(H) \geq 3$. This means that $H$ contains at least $16$ elements, so $|G:H| \leq 7$. Also, $8$ divides $|H|$, so $|G:H|$ is either $1$, $3$, or $5$. If $|G:H|$ is $3$ or $5$, then we're done: $H$ is the desired subgroup. If $|G:H| = 1$, then $S \cap T \lhd G$. Therefore, $K = G / (S \cap T)$ is a group of order $30$. Consequently, $K$ contains subgroups of order $3$ and $5$. By the Sylow theorems, $n_3(K)$ is either $1$ or $10$, and $n_5(K)$ is either $1$ or $6$. If $n_3(K) = 10$ and $n_5(K) = 6$, then $K$ contains $20$ elements of order $3$ and $24$ elements of order $5$, but this is impossible in a group of order $30$. Therefore, either $n_3(K) = 1$ or $n_5(K) = 1$. If $n_3(K) = 1$, then $K$ contains a normal subgroup $N$ of order $3$. Then $K/N$ is a group of order $10$, so it contains a subgroup of order $2$ (index $5$). By correspondence, $K$ also contains a subgroup of index $5$, and since $K = G / (S \cap T)$, this means that $G$ also contains a subgroup of index $5$. Similarly, if $n_5(K) = 1$, then $K$ contains a normal subgroup $N$ of order $5$. Then $K/N$ is a group of order $6$, so it contains a subgroup of order $2$ (index $3$). By correspondence, $K$ and $G$ also contain subgroups of index $3$.","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification', 'finite-groups']"

I have also tried the map $K[t]\to \mathcal{R}(f)$ which maps $t\mapsto\frac{x^2+y^2}{x-y}$ but I couldn't show that this extends to a map on $k(t)$.

1531802,How to construct isogenies between elliptic curves over finite fields for some simple cases?,"From the theorem of Tate, it is known that the two elliptic curves over the same field $\mathbb{F}_p$ are isogenous iff they have the same number of points. For $p\equiv 3\mod 4$, the curve $E_1(\mathbb{F}_p):y^2=x^3+x$ is supersingular, and it has $p+1$ points. So is the case $p\equiv2\mod 3$ and the curve $E_2(\mathbb{F}_p): y^2=x^3+B$, where $B\ne0$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$. And hence, when $p\equiv 11 \mod 12$, $E_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $E_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ are isogenous. But I wonder how can we construct an isogeny between them, even in the simplest case, when $p=11$?","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'number-theory', 'finite-fields']"

1531841,"Is there a plane algebraic curve with just 3-fold rotational symmetry, but without reflection symmetry?","I am new to the subject of invariant theory, but the Reynolds operator popped up so I tried to calculated some examples for myself. I computed the invariant polynomials under the cylic group $C_3$ of order $3$, given by $120°$ rotations in the plane. These polynomials, like $$\frac 1 4 (x^3-3xy^2), \frac 1 4 (3x^2y-y^3), x^2+y^2, ...$$ and their combinations give rise to nice 120°-symmetric plane curves. However, from what I can judge by looking at the plotted images in Wolframalpha, there always seems to be a reflection symmetry along some axis. Can we get rid of that? Is there an algebraic curve with just 120°-rotational symmetry but without additional reflection axes? Of course we can take a union of e.g. appropriately arranged circles expressed in a single equation, so we should just talk about irreducible curves . Is my observation even correct? Maybe there is some obvious counterexample. Thank you","['algebraic-geometry', 'geometry', 'invariant-theory']"

By a Corollary: If $f$ analytic in a region symmetric with respect to the real axis and if $f$ is real for real $z$, then $f(z) = \overline{f(\bar z)} $. So that, $f(z) = u(x+iy) + iv(x+iy) = u(x-iy) - iv(x-iy)$
$f(-z) = u(-x-iy) + iv(-x-iy) = u(-x+iy) - iv(-x+iy)$

1531887,Why is the commutator expressed as $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ instead of $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$?,"In almost all texts I am finding the definition The commutator of $a,b \in G$ is the element $$aba^{-1}b^{-1}$$ However, it seems more intuitive to me to define it as The commutator of $a,b \in G$ is the element $$a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$$ Because we can just interchange $a$ with $a^{-1}$ freely, since they are just labelings. For example, we could define $+1$ to be the action of $a$, hence $-1$ is the action of $a^{-1}$ or visa versa w.l.o.g. The reason why I feel that the second one is more intuitive is because you just pick a pair $a,b$. You then 'do' $b$, then 'do' $a$, then 'undo' $b$ then 'undo'  $a$, which seems more natural than the other way around. Is there a specific reason why the commutator is defined in this sense, or have I just got it all wrong. The same question I guess applies to conjugation, where $g^{-1}hg$ seems more natural than the usual $ghg^{-1}$. For example, I see conjugation as this Move the object Do something to the object Put the object back where it was originally Which would correspond more naturally to $g^{-1}hg$.","['group-theory', 'notation']"

1531896,Interpretation of PCA,"I am wondering if there is a practical interpretation of a principal component analysis: Consider you have a data matrix $X\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times p}$ and you perform a principal component analysis where you typically receive certain directions $v_1,...,v_q$, $q<p$, in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that explain the most of the variance in the data. Is there an interpretation of these principal components in terms of the original components, i.e. the variables $x_1,...,x_p$ that constitute the model. Think e.g. of $x_i$ being certain ""variables"" of a human body such as weight, blood pressure etc. that should be used to predict expected life time. If one now performs a PCA as described a above, one recognizes that certain linear combinations of the columns of $X$ explain most of the variance. If one wants to reduce the model (i.e. reduce the $p$), which variables do you exclude given the information of the PCA?","['regression-analysis', 'statistics', 'principal-component-analysis', 'regression']"
