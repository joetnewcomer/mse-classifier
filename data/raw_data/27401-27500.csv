253065,Span of functions dense in $L^2$,"This is an exercise from Werner's Funktionalanalysis. I have to show that the linear span of the functions $f_n(x)=x^ne^{-x^2/2}, n\geq0$ is dense in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The book gives the hint to first show that the Fourier transform of $\overline{f(x)}e^{-x^2/2}$ vanishes if  $\langle f,f_n\rangle=0$ for all $n$. Now I don't see how this knowledge about the Fourier transform would help with the original statement. The $f_n$ obviously don't contain some orthogonal set, so even if I could conclude that $f=0$ from this I couldn't use some maximal orthogonal system argument for Hilbert spaces. Also, I am unable to actually show the hint because for $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ the formula for the Fourier transform does not hold and most of the nice properties of the Fourier transform I know are only valid for Schwartzfunctions.

253081,Is any closed ball non-compact in an infinite dimensional space?,"It is known that the closed unit ball $\overline{B_1(0)}$ in a normed space $X$ is compact if and only if $\dim X < \infty$ . In particular, the $\overline{B_1(0)}$ is not compact if $\dim X = \infty$ . The proof of this involves finding a sequence $\{ x_n \}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} $ with $||x_n|| = 1 $ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $||x_n - x_m|| > \frac{1}{2}$ for all $n \neq m$ . Then this sequence is a bounded sequence that is not a Cauchy-sequence, so it does not have a converging subsequence, so $X$ is not (sequentially) compact. The construction then goes with Riesz's lemma , by subsequently finding points with norm 1 that have distance greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ to the subspace generated by the preceeding points. Now my question is, is any closed ball $\overline{B_r(0)}$ with $r>0$ non-compact in an infinite-dimensional space? It seems very intuitive, since topologically the balls are all diffeomorphic, and it would seem unlikely that for $r>1$ the larger ball is compact while $\overline{B_1(0)}$ is not. However, when I look at the proof, I notice that Riesz' lemma really only works for norm 1 and not for some arbitary norm. Is there any way to adapt this lemma or make use of a different construction in order to say something about all the closed balls?","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

253143,If $Lat(\mathcal{A})$ is trivial then $\mathcal{A}'$ consists of scalars.,"This is related to Exercise 3 of Section 2.5 of Arveson's book on spectral theory . For those who are interested, we were asked to show the following $\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach *-algebra. $\pi:\mathcal{A}\to B(\mathcal{H})$ is a *-homomorphism (a *-representation). If $\pi(\mathcal{A})$ has no nontrivial invariant subspaces ($\pi$ is irreducible), then the commutants of $\pi(\mathcal{A})$ are scalars. I can do this one if I am allowed to use the Double Commutant Theorem and the fact von Neumann algebras are generated by projections. (If $\pi(\mathcal{A})$ has no nontrivial subspaces then $\pi(\mathcal{A})'$, a von Neumann algebra has no projections hence it consists of the constants. If $\pi(A)'$ consists scalars then the double commutant the is $B(\mathcal{H})$. Thus $\pi(\mathcal{A})$ is strongly dense in $B(\mathcal{H})$ but this implies $\pi(\mathcal{A})$ has no nontrivial subspaces since $B(\mathcal{H})$ acts transitively on $\mathcal{H}$.) But I am pretty sure this problem can be done in a more elementary way since Arveson has not yet started to talk about von Neumann algebras. And the problem boils down to the title of this post. Can someone give a more elementary method? I am especially not comfortable with the von Neumann algebras are generated by projections part.

253147,$(\lambda-a)^{-1}$ as limits of 'polynomials',"For a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ the spectral permanence gives \begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathcal{B}}(a)=\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}(a)
\end{equation} for any unital $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{B}$. It is natural to look at the smallest such subalgebras, namely, the $C^*$-subalgebra generated by $1,a$ and $a^*$. Then the permanence says if $\lambda-a$ is invertible, then $\lambda-a$ is in the closed linear span of products of $1,a$ and $a^*$ (although order of multiplications matters here and it is not actually a polynomial). I am wondering whether there is some canonical way to construct these 'polynomials'.

Existence : Let $C$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{P}(U)$. $(\rightarrow)$ Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $C\setminus A$. Since $C\subseteq U$, then $x\in U\setminus A$. Therefore $x\in C\cap B$. $(\leftarrow)$ Let x be an arbitrary element of $C\cap B$. Then $x\in C\cap (U\setminus A)$, so we can conclude $x\in C\setminus A$. Uniqueness : Let $B'$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{P}(U)$ and suppose $\forall C\in\mathcal{P}(U)(C\setminus A=C\cap B')$. $(B'\subseteq B)$ Since $B'\in\mathcal{P}(U)$, then in particular $B'\setminus A=B'\cap B'=B'$, so clearly $B'\cap A=B'\cap (U\setminus B)=\varnothing$. Then $\forall x(x\not\in B'\lor x\not\in U\lor x\in B)$, which is equivalent to $\forall x(x\in B'\cap U\rightarrow x\in B$). Since $B'\subseteq U$, $B'\cap U=B'$, we now have $\forall x(x\in B'\rightarrow x\in B)$, and therefore $B'\subseteq B$. $(B\subseteq B')$ Let $C=B$. Then $B\setminus A=B\cap B'$, and because $B\cap A=\varnothing$, we have $B=B\cap B'$, so we can conclude $B\subseteq B'$.","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"
253447,prove that every continuous function is integrable,"Can someone tell me whether this is correct thank you! We know that if a function f is continuous on $[a,b]$, a closed finite interval, then f is uniformly continuous on that interval. This means that if we're given any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $x$ and $y$ are any two points in $[a,b]$ with $|x-y| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon$. So let's say we're given an epsilon. To show that a continuous function f is integrable, we must find a delta such that:
For all partitions $\Gamma= \{x_0< \ldots < x_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ with $|\Gamma|:=\max \{x_{i+1} - x_i\} < \delta$ we have 
$$\mathrm{S}_{\delta} - \mathrm{s}_{\delta} < \varepsilon,$$
where, 
$$\mathrm{S}_{\delta}:=\inf \Sigma\  M_i(x_{i+1} - x_i)\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathrm{s}_{\delta}:=\inf \Sigma\  m_i(x_{i+1} - x_i),$$ over all partitions $\Gamma$ that satisfies $|\Gamma|<\delta$, with  $M_i:=\max f|_{[x_i, x_i+1]}$ and $m_i:=\min f|_{[x_i, x_i+1]}$. So, to recap, for a given epsilon we must find a delta such that $\mathrm{S}_{\delta} - \mathrm{s}_{\delta} < \varepsilon$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$, we can choose $\delta$ such that 
$$|x-y| < \delta  \ \Rightarrow \ |f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon/(b-a).$$ Then, for this $\delta$, we have, for any partition $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma| <\delta$, that $M_i - m_i < \epsilon/(b-a)$. Therefore, $$\mathrm{S}_{\delta}-\mathrm{s}_{\delta} < \frac\varepsilon{(b-a)} (b-a) = \varepsilon.$$","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"
253453,Approximations of shortest curves,"Consider a set of functions $f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ that are supposed to approximate the function $\mathbf{0}:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $\mathbf{0}(x) \equiv 0$. The graph of $\mathbf{0}(x)$ is to be seen as the “reference curve”. Since the graph of $\mathbf{0}$ is the shortest curve between its end points, it seems natural to say that $f$ approximates $\mathbf{0}$ better than $g$ when the arc length of (the graph of) $f$ is shorter than that of $g$, i.e. $$\int_0^1\sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}dx < \int_0^1\sqrt{1 + g'(x)^2}dx\quad\quad\quad  (1_0)$$ But this conflicts with another measure of proximity: one can say $f$ approximates $\mathbf{0}$ better than $g$ when it deviates less from $\mathbf{0}$ than $g$ in the following sense $$\int_0^1 |f(x) - \mathbf{0}(x)| dx < \int_0^1 |g(x) - \mathbf{0}(x)| dx\quad\quad\quad  (2_0)$$ which means $$\int_0^1 |f(x)| dx < \int_0^1 |g(x)| dx\quad\quad\quad  (2_1)$$ which holds – for the sake of comparison with $(1)$ – iff $$\int_0^1\sqrt{1 + f(x)^2}dx < \int_0^1\sqrt{1 + g(x)^2}dx\quad\quad\quad  (2_2)$$ The “conflict” can easily be made visible: The red curve $g$ has the same length as the blue one $f$ while the area under $g$ is obviously greater than the area under $f$. There is another – “intrinsic” – property of the blue curve $f$ that makes it a better approximation than the red curve $g$ – and even without an explicit reference to $\mathbf{0}$: it changes its direction “more often”. In integral notation: $$\int_0^1 |f''(x)| dx > \int_0^1 |g''(x)| dx\quad\quad\quad  (3_0)$$ or equivalently: $$\int_0^1\sqrt{1 + f''(x)^2}dx > \int_0^1\sqrt{1 + g''(x)^2}dx\quad\quad\quad  (3_1)$$ In which “theory” or framework do these findings fit together – and how?

253554,asymptotics of the square indicator sum for subsequences of digits,"Introduce the function $g(n)$ defined for positive integer arguments $n$ as the count of squares of positive integers among the numbers that can be formed by taking some subsequence of the digits of the binary representation of $n$ and interpreting this subsequence as a binary number. All subsequences contribute. For example, $5 = (101)_2$ and the subsequences of digits are
$$ (1)_2 = 1, (0)_2 = 0, (1)_2 = 1, (10)_2 = 2, (11)_2 = 3, (01)_1 = 1, (101)_2 = 5$$
and this includes the square ""one"" three times, so $g(5) = 3.$ When $n = 9 = (1001)_2$, we obtain the following subsequences:
$$ (1)_2 = 1, (0)_2 = 0, (0)_2 = 0, (1)_2 = 1,
(10)_2 = 2, (10)_2 = 2, (11)_2 = 3, (00)_2 = 0, (01)_2 = 1, (01)_2 = 1$$
and
$$ (100)_2 = 4, (101)_2 = 5, (101)_2 = 5, (001)_2 = 1, (1001)_2 = 9$$
and this includes seven squares, so $g(9) = 7.$ The behavior of $g(n)$ is highly erratic, ranging from linear for $n=2^k$ to logarithmic for $n=2^k-1,$ which motivates us to ask the following question. What is the first term of the asymptotic expansion of the average order of $g(n)$? I.e. find the asymptotics of
$$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n g(k).$$ It might be useful to establish and prove closed form expressions for special values of $g(n)$, e.g. we have $g(2^k) = 2^{k-1}$ and $g(2^k-1) = k$ as pointed out earlier (prove these).
Here are the first few terms of $g(n):$
$$1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 8, 15, 9, 12, 8, 9, 6, 7, 8, 11$$ This problem is not suited to numeric experimentation because $g(n)$ fluctuates so rapidly.

This implies that $x$ and $y$ belong to different closed intervals in $C_N$ and also, there must exist an element, $z$, where $x<z<y$, but $z\notin C_N$ and hence, $z\notin C$ (i.e. $z$ was in the open interval ""removed"" when constructing the Cantor set).

Then, since $A$ is the set of all elements in $C$ less than $z$ and $B$ is the set of all elements in $C$ greater than $z$ (and $z$ is not in $C$), it follows that $C=A\cup B$, and therefore $C$ is totally disconnected.

Let $C_i$ denote the event that the members of couple $i$ are seated next to each other, $i = 1,...,n$ a) Find $P(C_i)$ Attempt: So this is the prob that one particular couple sit next to each other. There are $2n$ seats for the first person. Given that the table is round, there are 2 seats for the wife/husband, (either to the left or right) and $(2n-2)!$ rearrangements of the remaining people.  Since each of the orderings are equally likely, $|s| = (2n)!$ and the prob we want is $(2n) \cdot 2 \cdot (2n-2)! / (2n)! = 2/(2n-1) $ Is it a good argument? b) For $j \neq i,\, \text{find} \, P(C_i|C_j)$ Attempt: This is the prob that given some couple $j$ already sitting next to one another, what is the probability that some other couple $i$ are sitting next to each other. By definition, this is equal to $P(C_i, C_j)/P(C_j)$. I already computed the denominator in a), so I need only worry about the numerator. 
For the numerator: If couple $i$ and $j$ are to sit next to each other, there are $(2n)$ places for the first person and $2$ choices for the next person. For the other couple, I am not really sure what to say since if one member of couple $j$ sits next to a member of couple $i$, then there is only one place for the other member of couple $j$. But, if the couple $j$ do not sit any where near couple $i$ then there is more than one place for the other member. It seems reasonable to compute therefore, $$P(C_i,C_j) = P(C_i,C_j| \text{one member of j next to i})P(\text{one member of j next to i}) + P(C_i,C_j|\text{member of j not next to i})P(\text{member of j not next to i})$$ Does this make sense and is my approach good or not? c) Approximate the probability, for $n$ large, that there are no married couples who are seated next to each other.

253882,Counting binary sequences with no more than $2$ equal consecutive numbers,"I invented the following problem, but I can't solve it. There are $n$ $1$'s and $n$ $0$'s and my question is what is the number of ways to arrange them avoiding $3$ equal consecutive numbers. So for instance, $n=3$ gives 001011, 001101, 010011, 010101, 010110, 011001, 011010, and the same sequences that start with $1$, that's $14$ in total. The first values are: $2,6,14,34,84,208$. (starting with $n=1$) It seems to be almost an exponential function. I started defining the function $N(a,b)$ which gives all possible sequences with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones such that no $3$ consecutive numbers are equal, and that begin with a $0$.
The same for $E(a,b)$ which gives all possible sequences with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones such that no $3$ consecutive numbers are equal, and that begin with a $1$.
It's not hard to see that $N(a,b)=E(b,a)$. I found a kind of recursive formula for $N(a,b)$. Such a sequence can start with $00$. The rest of it is a sequence that starts with a $1$, that gives $E(a-2,b)=N(b,a-2)$ possibilities. If it starts with $01$, every tail is possible unless those that start with $11$. The question is what this number of sequences is that start with $11$. But because after these two $1$'s comes a $0$, it's simply $N(a-1,b-3)$. Adding everything up gives $$N(a,b)=N(a-1,b-1)+N(b-1,a-1)+N(b,a-2)-N(a-1,b-3).$$ This is another approach of mine: Every sequence consists a certain number of series of $1$'s and of $0$'s. Let $n$ be divisible by $2$ (The other case is almost the same.) The number of series is at least $n/2$ and at most $n$. The number of $0$-series can be equal to or one more then the number of $1$-series. Because every series has at least one element, the total is $$N(a,a)=1+\sum_{k=n/2}^{n-1}\binom{k}{n-k}\left(\binom{k}{n-k}+\binom{k+1}{n-k-1}\right)$$ but this summation is not worth being called a solution.

253910,The Integral that Stumped Feynman?,"In "" Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! ,"" Nobel-prize winning Physicist Richard Feynman said that he challenged his colleagues to give him an integral that they could evaluate with only complex methods that he could not do with real methods: One time I boasted, ""I can do by other methods any integral anybody else needs contour integration to do."" So Paul [Olum] puts up this tremendous damn integral he had obtained by starting out with a complex function that he knew the answer to, taking out the real part of it and leaving only the complex part. He had unwrapped it so it was only possible by contour integration! He was always deflating me like that. He was a very smart fellow. Does anyone happen to know what this integral was?","['integration', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

253922,"Prove that any group $G$ of order $p^2$ is abelian, where $p$ is a prime number [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Closed 11 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Showing non-cyclic group with $p^2$ elements is Abelian ""Let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that any group $G$ of order $p^2$ is abelian. You may assume the fact that the centre of a $p$-group is non-trivial"". I understand from the question is that the group $G$ is a $p$-group, with $p^2$ number of elements in it (meaning it is finite). Also, the centre, i.e the set of elements where $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$, is non-trivial, meaning $\neq e$. So, the non-trivial bit shows that the center, $Z$, either generates the group, so it's cyclic and therefore abelian by definition. Or, it generates a subgroup of order p, and so $Z$ with some elements missing from group $G$ generate G, but as these groups commute (because they have a centre of $Z$), we can say the group is abelian. Is this correct?","['proof-writing', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
253936,Is every group the automorphism group of a group?,"Suppose $G$ is a group. Does there always exist a group $H$, such that $\operatorname{Aut}(H)=G$, i. e. such that $G$ is the automorphism group of $H$? EDIT: It has been pointed out that  the answer to the above question is no . But I would be much more pleased if someone could give an example of such a group $G$ not arising as an automorphism group together with a comparatively easy proof of this fact.","['examples-counterexamples', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
253951,Relationship between integral equations and partial differential equations,"In my functional analysis class, we did a lot of problems involving integral equations such as proving existence & uniqueness using spectral theory and the Banach fixed point theorem. I've never seen integral equations outside of functional analysis, but apparently they are useful for ordinary/partial differential equations. If someone familiar with integral equation methods could give some motivation, I would really appreciate it. Also, are there any good textbooks that discuss integral equation methods for PDE's?","['integral-equations', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
