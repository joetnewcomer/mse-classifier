276650,What is the difference between writing $f$ and $f(x)$?,"I see a lot of professors in my calculus courses using $f$ and $f(x)$ in a way that looks interchangeable. Sometimes it drives me crazy because I always thought of them as being different. ( $f$ means an independent variable, $f(x)$ means a variable which is dependent on $x$ .) I also can't keep up with which variable is dependent on which... So, when a professor writes down $f$ instead of $f(x)$ or $x$ instead of $x(t)$ , do they actually mean that $x$ is in/dependent? Or are they intentionally not writing it fully? Thanks!",['calculus']

276742,Proof that Sorgenfrey plane is not normal using points x × (-x),"I'm making Exercise 9 of paragraph 31 in Munkres, which is a proof that the Sorgenfrey Plane $\mathbb{R}_l^2$ is not normal. I'm having trouble on part c of the question. The full question is: Let $A$ be the set of all points of $\mathbb{R}_l^2$ of the form $x \times (-x)$, for $x$ rational; let $B$ be the set of all points of this form for $x$ irrational. If $V$ is an open set of $\mathbb{R}_l^2$ containing $B$, show there exists no open set $U$ containing $A$ that is disjoint from $V$, as follows: (a) Let $K_n$ consist of all irrational numbers $x$ in $[0,1]$ such that $[x,x+1/n) \times [-x,-x+1/n)$ is contained in $V$. Show $[0,1]$ is the union of the sets $K_n$ and countably many one point sets. (b) User exercise $5$ of paragraph 27 to show that some set $\bar{K}_n$ contains an open interval $(a,b)$ of $\mathbb{R}$. (c) Show that $V$ contains the open parallelogram consisting of all points of the form $x \times (-x+\epsilon)$ for which $a<x<b$ and $0<\epsilon<1/n$. (d) Conclude that if $q$ is a rational number with $a < q < b$, then the point $q \times (-q)$ of $\mathbb{R}_l^2$ is a limit point of $V$. I've done (a) relatively easy I think, simply by proving that for every irrational $x$there must be an $n$ so that $x$ lies in $K_n$, and then adding all rational one-point sets. (b) was something I did in the exercise mentioned before. My problem (at the moment) lies in (c). First of all, I don't know if they mean only the irrational $x$'s or the rationals too. Second, in (b) we worked with the closure of $K_n$ and not $K_n$ itself. Does the closure of $K_n$ automatically lie in $V$ too? If yes, any hints how to prove this; if no, how do I actually start (c)?",['general-topology']
276745,Minimal polynominal: geometric meaning,I am currently studying Chapter 6 of Hoffman & Kunze's Linear Algebra which deals with characteristic values and triangulation and diagonalization theorems. The chapter makes heavy use of the concept of the minimal polynomial which it defines as the monic polynomial of the smallest degree that annihilates a linear transformation. I am currently finding the proofs in the book that use this definition of the minimal polynomial to be very opaque: just chains of calculations with polynomials that turn out to give the right answer in the end. I was therefore wondering if there is a more geometric view of the minimal polynomial? What information about the linear transformation is it carrying and why? I guess the answer would be simpler in the case of an algebraically closed field but is there an answer which also works for a general field?,['linear-algebra']

276962,Matrices with columns which are eigenvectors,"In this question , the OP asks about finding the matrix exponential of the matrix $$M=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.$$ It works out quite nicely because $M^2 = 3M$ so $M^n = 3^{n-1}M$. The reason this occurs is that the vector $$v = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ is an eigenvector for $M$ (with eigenvalue $3$). The same is true of the $n\times n$ matrix consisting of all ones and the corresponding vector. With this in mind, I ask the following: Can we find a standard form for an $n\times n$ matrix with the property that each of its columns are eigenvectors? ( Added later: This may be easier to answer if we allow columns to be zero vectors. Thanks Adam W for the comment.) What about the case when we require all the eigenvectors to correspond to the same eigenvalue? The matrices in the second question are precisely the ones for which the calculation of the matrix exponential would be analogous to that for $M$ as above. Added later: In Hurkyl's answer, he/she shows that an invertible matrix satisfying 1 is diagonal. For the case $n=2$, it is fairly easy to see that any non-invertible matrix satisfies 1 (which is generalised by the situation in Seirios's answer). However, for $n > 2$, not every non-invertible matrix satisfies this property (as one may expect). For example, $$M = \begin{bmatrix}

277005,Successful approaches to the modelization of ''randomness'',"If you pick a number $x$ randomly from $[0,100]$, we would naturally say that the probability of $x>50$ is $1/2$, right? This is because we assumed that randomly meant that the experiment was to pick a point from $[0,100]$ (with numbers equally distributed). But, since $f(r)=r^2$ is a bijection  $[0,10] \rightarrow [0,100]$, we could also pick a number $r$ from $[0,10]$ and then do $x=r^2 \in [0,100]$ and let that be our random experiment. This time $x>5$ only for $r> \sqrt{50} \sim 7.07$. In this case we would agree that the first way of choosing $x$ looks a lot more natural . So we would equally agree that is a successful way of modeling the experiment ''pick a random number from [0,100]''. There are sometimes when we can't even agree on that! For example, on Bertrand's Paradox we are asked to pick a random chord from a circumference and calculate the probability that it is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle. The point is there are several (a priori) natural ways of choosing the chords (three of them are nicely described here ) which, of course, produce different probabilities. How and when can we consider something is truly random ? Does it even make any sense saying something is truly random or is it more a matter of agreement? Is there any convention in the mathematical community about this issues? Could we say the common notion of randomness relates to the notion of uniform distribution? Are there any successful approaches on models about randomness? (That let us decide if a certain distribution represents randomness in the sense of being an uniform distribution) For example, on the comments it is said: ""One can show [using Kolmogorov Complexity ] that a number in [0,1] is random with probability 1 under the uniform distribution, so it coheres well with other notions.''","['probability-theory', 'philosophy', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

277025,Trapezoid area proof by dividing it into two triangles?,"I am trying to figure out how the formula for the area of a trapezoid with exactly two parallel sides is deduced. In my textbook it says that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is deduced by dividing the trapezoid into two triangles, one with base a and height h, and one with base b and height h. $A={a\times h\over 2} + {b\times h\over 2} = {a\times h + b\times h\over 2} = {h(a+b)\over 2}$ I have drawn this diagram in GeoGebra. It may not be drawn to scale (it is not congruent) with the diagram in my textbook, but it is actually similar. I actually scanned the diagram from my textbook and then made this diagram on top of it. In the textbook, they did not mark the vertices. But I have named the vertices (blue) to simplify explanation, so that we have something to refer to. The formula above is the one that's given in the textbook. From just the looks of it, does this even make any sense to you? They drew this diagram and named the sides of it as a, b, c and d. They also drew the altitude h and the diagonal DB. I can't make the connection with the formula. And I have seen an actual proof of the area of a trapezoid like this on a website. There are at least two different proofs for the area of a trapezoid. Perhaps the most common proof is where you would divide the trapezoid into two triangles and a rectangle. But two triangles??... So what I am asking for is for someone to give me a proof that the formula for the area of a trapezoid can be deduced by dividing the trapezoid into two triangles, as indicated by this diagram. I know that the area of a triangle is base times the height divided by two, or 1/2 times the base times the height. It is essentially half of the area of the rectangle. So if I consider that first part of the formula above I get this. (Image upload to Imgur doesn't work at the moment. I'll get back to it.) Update: $[DBE]={a\times h\over 2}$ I have constracted the altitude DF. The area for triangle DBE is half of the area of DFBE. $[BGA]={b\times h\over 2}$ I have constructed the altitude AH. The area for triangle BHA is half of the area of BEHA. But this gives me the overlapping triangle GBH. It overlaps with triangle DBE. Is the area of GBH equal to the area of AGD? And what about the triangles EBC and DFA? Update: I think I got it right now. So here's that second diagram again. And here is the third diagram once again. They are not the same size this time. I think I got the scale wrong on export to PNG image. But here you can see that I have shaded and measured the areas of the rectangles and triangles to show how it interacts with the area of the trapezoid. I know that this is not really a formal proof of the area of a trapezoid. But I think this makes sense to me now. I was getting confused by the fact that the triangle ABD had no height or altitude. Or it was not within the triangle itself, it was outside of the triangle . And also I had hard time seeing how that overlapping part GHB ""transforms"" (or however you want to call it) into that other empty space. But I now see it more clearly. So this really comes from the formula of the area of a triangle then? Or maybe we can say that the area of a triangle is used as a postulate to prove the area of a trapezoid?",['geometry']

In particular $\mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ trivially
forms a $d^{2}$-dimensional manifold since it's globally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}}$. 
Next we want to show that the set $\mathrm{P}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ of all positive
$d\times d$-matrices (which is a subset of $\mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$) is open in the relative topology of $\mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$.
Therefor it constitutes a $d^{2}$-dimensional manifold.
To see this we can consider the map 
\begin{align}
f: \mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right) &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d^{2}} \nonumber\\
A &\mapsto \left(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{d^{2}}\right)
\end{align}
which maps a hermitian matrix to its eigenvalues. This map is continuous.
Since $\mathbb{R}_{>0}^{d^{2}}$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}}$ it follows that the preimage 
$f^{-1}\left(\mathbb{R}_{>0}^{d^{2}}\right)=\mathrm{P}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ 
is also open in $\mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$.
Now consider the map 
\begin{align}
g: \mathrm{H}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right) &\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \nonumber\\
\rho &\mapsto {\rm tr}(\rho).
\end{align}
We need to show that 1 is a regular value of g. To do so we pick a $\rho\in g^{-1}(1)$. 
Next we choose a curve $\gamma: (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ with
$\gamma(0) = \rho$ and $\partial_{t}\gamma(0) = A$ for some $A\in T_{\rho}\mathrm{P}_{d\times d}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$. 
We calculate that 
\begin{equation}
dg_{\rho}A := \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|_{t=0} {\rm tr}(\gamma(t)) ={\rm tr}(A).
\end{equation}
Certainly $dg_{\rho}$ is surjective. This proofs the result. I'm wondering whether this proof can be extended to positive-semidefinite matrices since a positive-semidefinite matrix can be approximated by a sequence of positive definite matrices. I'm however not sure whether the ""boundary"" that we will obtain is still regular in the sense that it contains no ""sharp edges"". I would be more than happy for some suggestions and ideas.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

In the following graph, all x nodes are connected to their adjacent (diagonal included) x nodes and the same goes for o nodes and b nodes. x o o b x o b b x I wrote an algorithm that does this by taking a node and using depth first search to find all nodes connected to it. Then I remove those nodes from the graph and repeat with a new node until there are no more nodes left in the graph. I'm starting to think that this isn't the most efficient method and that there has to be a way to do this using an adjacency matrix or something similar. If I were to translate the above graph into an adjacency matrix and name each node (1..9, left to right, top to bottom), it would look like this: ~~ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 | 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 | 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 3 | 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 5 | 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 | 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 8 | 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 9 | 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 I put zeros down the diagonal, but I'm not sure if that's right notation for an adjacency matrix.

when squared is lower triangular. But is the square root, when it exists, always lower triangular? I have found some examples that give a diagonal matrix:
$$\pmatrix{1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & e & 0 \\ c & 0 & -1}\pmatrix{1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & e & 0 \\ c & 0 & -1}=\pmatrix{c+1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & e^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & c+1}=L$$

I believe the answer is yes, that if the square root of a strictly lower triangular exists, then that is also lower triangular. I am looking for a good argument as to why, or for any counter examples. EDIT: Also, all $ 2 \times 2$ that gives the upper right zero in the square implies also the lower left is zero.
