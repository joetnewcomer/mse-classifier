3404153,How to determine whether a triangle is obtuse angled or not from the equation of its sides?,"Suppose we are given the equation of the sides of a triangle, how can we determine whether the triangle is obtuse angled or acute angled? In case of a right angled triangle, I would simply check whether the slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ of any two lines follow the relation $m_1m_2=-1$ . I know to find the angle between two intersecting lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ using the following formula: $$\tan \theta = \left|\frac{m_2-m_1}{1+m_1m_2} \right|$$ The problem is, the above formula is helpful in finding only the positive values of the tangent function, or only for acute angles, due to the presence of the absolute value function. Are there any other algorithm to distinguish acute angle triangles from obtuse angled triangles? Is it possible to use the same formula to find them?","['triangles', 'analytic-geometry', 'angle', 'geometry']"

3404213,Turán’s Graph Theorem: Motivation behind the Weight Function,"If a graph $G = (V, E)$ on $n$ vertices has no $p$ -clique, $p \geq 2$ ,
then $$|E| \leq \Big(1- \frac{1}{p-1}\Big) \frac{n^2}{2} \;\;\; \;\;\; \;\;\;(1)$$ We get a proof from the book ""Proofs from THE BOOK"" as given below Now I would like to understand the motivation of the function that was being maximized - $$f(w)=\sum_{v_i v_j \in E} w_i w_j$$ The function is used to write $\frac{|E|}{n^2}$ , but for uniform distribution it is more intuitive to write, $\frac{|E|\times 2}{n}$ , since each edge has two vertices, with each node having $1/n$ weight, thus each edge would have weight $1/n+1/n=2/n$ , it implies $\frac{|E|\times 2}{n}$ . to follow this line of thinking we have to change the function for the above part of the proof, I don't know whether it yields the same result, but I wonder why it is not used? why $f(w)=\sum_{v_i v_j \in E} w_i w_j$ is used instead of $$f(w)=\sum_{v_i v_j \in E} w_i + w_j$$ ?

3404214,Is the set of primes which can be represented as sum of different primes infinite?,"Although everything is clear from a title of a question I will just add some notation and two simple examples.

Is $P$ an infinite set? Edit : As mentioned in the comments, if the twin-primes conjecture is true then also this question is answered in the affirmative but I firmly believe that this can be solved without first solving twin-primes conjecture because this is much weaker than twin-primes conjecture since here there are no restrictions on the number of summands, which equals two in the twin-prime conjecture.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

3404947,Dwork's theory on periods and points counting of elliptic curves.,"The Legendre family of elliptic curves is defined by \begin{equation}
y^2=x(x-1)(x-\lambda).
\end{equation} The integration of the algebraic one-form $dx/y$ (up to a nonzero multiple) is given by the hypergeometric series \begin{equation}
F(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1;\lambda)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \binom{-\frac{1}{2}}{j}^2 \lambda^j.
\end{equation} From the theory of Dwork, we can counts the points of elliptic curves using this period. More precisely, for an odd prime number $p$ , we define a new power series \begin{equation}
U(\lambda)=F(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1;\lambda)/F(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1;\lambda^p).
\end{equation} Dwork showed that $U(t)$ can be analytically continued to a function defined in the $p$ -adic radius $\geq 1$ . While if $\lambda_0 \in\mathbb{F}_p-\{0,1\}$ , let $1-a(\lambda_0)T+pT^2$ be the numerator of the zeta function of the elliptic curve $y^2=x(x-1)(x-\lambda_0)$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$ . Then we have \begin{equation}

I looked to his previous results, and I still do not fully understand it. So, if you could explain to me, I would appreciate it. Secondly, I think that ""noncontinuable"" means a solution that could not be extended to $ a $ and $ b $ . If this is not the case, please correct my conceptual flaw. Thirdly, it seems to me that the $ f(x, t) $ equals to the derivative of $ \displaystyle\frac{1}{(t-a)(t-b)} $ would suffice. That is to say, $$ f(x,t)=\frac{a+b-2t}{(t-a)^2(t-b)^2} $$ Am I right?

3405269,On the Equivalent Norms for Subspaces,"By a function space I mean a vector space of functions. Assume that $M$ is a function spaces which $\|\cdot\|_{X}$ and $\|\cdot\|_{Y}$ are defined such that \begin{align*}
\|f+g\|_{X}&\leq\|f\|_{X}+\|g\|_{X}\\
\|af\|_{X}&=|a|\|f\|_{X}
\end{align*} but with the possibility that $\|f\|_{X}=\infty$ for $f\in M$ . Of course $\|\cdot\|_{Y}$ also bears these properties. Now let $X$ and $Y$ be such that $\|f\|_{X}<\infty$ and $\|f\|_{Y}<\infty$ respectively for $f\in M$ , so both $\|\cdot\|_{X}$ and $\|\cdot\|_{Y}$ are norms on $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Assume further that a subspace $D$ is such that $\overline{D}^{X}=X$ and $\overline{D}^{Y}=Y$ and we have \begin{align*}
\|f\|_{X}\approx\|f\|_{Y},~~~~f\in D
\end{align*} in the sense that \begin{align*}
c^{-1}\|f\|_{Y}\leq\|f\|_{X}\leq c\|f\|_{Y},~~~~f\in D
\end{align*} where the constant $c>0$ is independent of $f\in D$ . Initially I was thinking that if $X=Y$ . Note that $f\in X$ only satisfies that $\|f\|_{X}<\infty$ but could be $\|f\|_{Y}=\infty$ and vice versa. If $X=Y$ , then whether it is necessarily that \begin{align*}
\|f\|_{X}\approx\|f\|_{Y}.
\end{align*} But actually this seems need no to be the case. For the second concern, suppose $f\in X$ and $f_{n}\in D$ are such that $\|f_{n}-f\|_{X}\rightarrow 0$ , we wish to show that $\|f\|_{Y}\leq C\|f\|_{X}$ , this will imply at the same time that $\|f\|_{Y}<\infty$ . At first we have \begin{align*}
\|f\|_{X}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\|f_{n}\|_{X}\geq c^{-1}\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\|f_{n}\|_{Y}.
\end{align*} But one cannot assert immediately that \begin{align*}
\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\|f_{n}\|_{Y}\geq\|f\|_{Y}.
\end{align*} And of course $\|f_{n}-f\|_{X}\rightarrow 0$ says nothing about the convergence of $\|f_{n}-f\|_{Y}$ . Philosophy: Initially I have a philosophical view that two norms are equivalent on a dense subspace, then they should also be equivalent on the space, which is just a slightly larger than the dense subspace, but I think that my philosophical view is not accurate. Therefore I am looking for counterexample. At least, can we say that $X=Y$ as sets?

3405697,A proof of Taylor's Peano Remainder using little o notation,"I have two questions relating to a proof I found of the Peano remainder form: $f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(k)}(x_{0})}{k!}(x-x_{0})^{k}+\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|^{n}\right)$ . Keep in mind that the little o notation here is that if $f \in \mathrm{o}(t)$ then: $ \lim_{\substack{t\rightarrow0\\ t\neq0} }\frac{f(t)}{t}=0$ I am not interested in general proofs of Peano's remainder form, but particularly in how the little o notation is manipulated. So this is more of a little o notation question than a Taylor's theorem proof question. This linked proof begins using the integral form of the remainder and the assumption that $f \in C^n$ , so the proof has an extra assumption compared to the normal Peano remainder proofs, which usually only assume $n$ times differentiability (so $f^{(n)}$ is not necessarily continuous). My first issue is with the proof itself, which says that \begin{aligned}\frac{(x-x_{0})^{n}}{(n-1)!}\int_{0}^{1}\left[f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))-f^{(n)}(x_{0})\right](1-t)^{n-1}dt.\end{aligned} can be simplified to $\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|^{n}\right)$ . The last line says that since $f^{(n)}$ is assumed continuous, we have that $\left[f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))-f^{(n)}(x_{0})\right] \in \mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|\right)$ . I am trying to show that this is true, but can't seem to justify it. I think that continuity is necessary so that the limit as $x \rightarrow x_0$ of $f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))$ is $f^{(n)}(x_{0})$ and so the $\left[f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))-f^{(n)}(x_{0})\right]$ term goes to $0$ . But I am not sure how this implies that $\left[f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))-f^{(n)}(x_{0})\right]$ goes to $0$ faster than $(|x-x_{0}|)$ , since we have no details about $f^{(n)}$ . I am thinking it could be since $t \in [0,1]$ and so for a given increment $x - x_0$ , $f^{(n)}(x_{0}+t(x-x_{0}))$ is closer to $f^{(n)}(x_{0})$ than $f^{(n)}(x_{0}+(x-x_{0}))$ otherwise would have been, but I'm unsure if this is valid reasoning. It also seems more like a 'big O' case than 'little o'. In addition, I am wondering how \begin{aligned}\frac{(x-x_{0})^{n}}{(n-1)!}\int_{0}^{1}\left[\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|\right)\right](1-t)^{n-1}dt.\end{aligned} is simplified to $\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|^{n}\right)$ , since there is an $(x-x_{0})^{n}$ multiplied by $\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|\right)$ , which I think should be $\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|^{n+1}\right)$ and not $\mathrm{o}\left(|x-x_{0}|^{n}\right)$ as the remainder should appear as. So those are my main questions, and my confusion mostly pertains to the little o notation and it's manipulations.

3405770,Prove that Solution of Integral Equation Is Solution of Differential Equation (Convection-Diffusion),"We are interested in the following initial-value problem for the Convection-Diffusion Equation: $\partial_t u(t,x) - \Delta u(t,x) = a\cdot\nabla u(t,x)^3 $ , for all $t \in (0,T)$ , $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$ $u(0,x) = u_0(x) \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N) $ . Note this is similar to the Heat Equation, but we have replaced the usual $0$ on the right-hand side with the term $a\cdot\nabla u(t,x)^3$ , where $a \in \mathbb{R}^N $ is a constant. So far, we have successfully found a solution to the following integral equation: $u(t) = G(t) \ast u_0 + \int_{0}^{t} a\cdot \nabla G(t-s) \ast u(s)^3 \,ds$ , where $G(t,x) = \dfrac{1}{(4 \pi t)^{N/2}} \,\exp\left(\dfrac{-|x|^2}{4t}\right) $ is the Heat Kernel. $\ast$ denotes convolution over space: $\displaystyle (G(t) \ast u_0)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} G(t, x-y)\,u_0(y) \,dy.$ We have shown that the solution to the above integral solution is unique in the set $C([0,T] ; L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N) )$ for some sufficiently small $T > 0$ , and is bounded in the following sense: $\displaystyle\sup_{t\in [0,T]} \|u(t)\|_{L^1} + \|u(t)\|_{L^\infty} < R$ , for some constant $R > \|u_0\|_{L^1} + \|u_0\|_{L^\infty}$ . Finally, we have successfully shown some regularity results in this integral solution $u$ . We have shown that $ u \in C([0,T] ; L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N) ) \cap C([0,T] ; W^{2,p}(\mathbb{R}^N) ) $ . Our claim is that this solution $u$ to the integral equation is also a solution to the differential equation. In order to prove this, we try to take the time-derivative of $u$ directly. Using the integral equation, we know that $\partial_t u(t) = \partial_t G(t) \ast u_0 + \partial_t \int^{t}_{0} a\cdot\nabla G(t-s) \ast u(s)^3 \,ds$ . Using the definition of the Heat Kernel, it's clear to see that $\partial_t G(t) \ast u_0 = \Delta_x G(t) \ast u_0$ . We are concerned with the second term $\partial_t \int^{t}_{0} a\cdot\nabla G(t-s) \ast u(s)^3 \,ds$ . First, using the property of convolution $f \ast g = g \ast f$ , we can move the gradient $\partial_t \int^{t}_{0} a\cdot\nabla G(t-s) \ast u(s)^3 \,ds = \partial_t \int^{t}_{0} G(t-s) \ast a\cdot\nabla u(s)^3 \,ds$ Next, we know the following property of the heat kernel $\displaystyle\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} G(t,y) f(x-y) \,dy = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \delta(x) f(x-y) \,dy = f(x)$ . I have been told this is enough to say that: $ \displaystyle\partial_t \int^{t}_{0} G(t-s) \ast a\cdot\nabla u(s)^3 \,ds = a\cdot\nabla u(s)^3 + \int^{t}_{0} \partial_t G(t-s) \ast a\cdot\nabla u(s)^3 \,ds $ .

3405882,Measure on the real line that is associated with the Stieltjes measure function,"I am reading the proof of Theorem 1.1.4 in Durrett Edition 5, states as follows: Associated with each Stieltjes measure function $F$ , there is a unique measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{R})$ such that $\mu((a,b])=F(b)-F(a).$ Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the semi-algebra containing the empty set and all the half-open intervals $(a,b]$ with $-\infty\leq a<b\leq\infty$ . I understand most of the proof where Durrett tried to verify the assumption of Caratheodory's Extension Theorem to extend this set function $\mu$ to a unique measure on $\mathcal{R}=\sigma(\mathcal{S})$ , however I don't understand his statement at the beginning of the proof, which is following: To define $\mu$ on $\mathcal{S}$ , we begin by observing that $$F(\infty)=\lim_{x\nearrow\infty}F(x)\ \text{and}\ F(-\infty)=\lim_{x\searrow-\infty}F(x)\ \text{exist}$$ and $\mu((a,b])=F(b)-F(a)$ makes sense for all $-\infty\leq a<b\leq\infty$ since $F(\infty)>-\infty$ and $F(-\infty)<\infty$ . I have two confusions: (1) Why does $F(\infty)$ exist? $F$ is right continuous so $F(-\infty)$ exists, but can we take $x\nearrow\infty$ ? (2) Why $F(-\infty)<\infty$ and $F(\infty)>-\infty$ ? I understand that Durrett want this to be good for $a=-\infty$ and $b=\infty$ ,his proof that since $F(\infty)$ and $F(-\infty)$ exist, then we just have $$\mu((-\infty,\infty])=F(\infty)-F(-\infty)<\infty,$$ so that $\mu$ is a well-defined set function. However, perhaps $F(-\infty)\leq\infty$ ? instead of $<$ ? because $F$ is non-decreasing, instead of strictly increasing?

What I barely understand: Each element of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$ intersects $[0, 1]$ First, is an element of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$ a representative of a set of the form $A_x = \{x+q, q \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}$ ?

3406155,Is there strict 2-to-1 continuous map from $D^2\to D^2$?,"As title goes. A `strict 2-to-1 continuous map' refers to a continuous map $f$ such that for any point $x\in D^2$ , the preimage $f^{-1}(x)$ has exactly 2 points. Actually, there are three problems. Let $D^2=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2: |x|\leq 1\}$ . Is there any map $f: D^2\to D^2$ which is strict 2-to-1? Is there any map $f: D^2_0\to D^2_0$ which is strict 2-to-1? Where $D_0^2=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2:|x|<1\}$ the interior of $D^2$ . This is equivalent to find 2-to-1 continuous map $\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ . Is there any map $f: D^2\to D^2$ which is strict 2-to-1 with the restriction of $f|_{S^1}=[z\mapsto z^2]$ ? Here are some remarks. When $f$ is a covering, all the above are not true. Because there is no connected covering for a simple connected space. But ``the map having same cardinality of fibre is covering map'' is not true, consider these four maps which are not covering maps. When $f$ is holomorphism, then $f$ will map the boundary to boundary. $f$ has and only has two zeros, then $f$ will be a product of two Blahcke factors (Since such zero free function with $|f|=1$ on boundary is constant by maximal modulus principle) which is very easy to check. When $f$ is an open map, we can construct a continous map $g: D^2\to S^1$ by the following way. Let $f^{-1}(x)=\{a_1,a_2\}$ , let $b$ be the point where the line passing through $a_1$ and $a_2$ intersect with the circle $S^1$ , and define $g(x)=b^2$ . So when $f|_{S^1}=[z\mapsto z^2]$ , since now $g|_{S^1}=\operatorname{id}_{S^1}$ , it is not true by an argument of fundamental group. (Proof that $g$ is continous.) Let $$h:\underbrace{\{(x,y)\in D^2\times D^2:x\neq y\}}_{D'} \to S^1$$ be the map of ``square of intersecting $S^1$ '', so for any open subset $U\subseteq S^1$ , $$g^{-1}(U)=\{x\in D^2: \exists (a_1,a_2)\in D', x=f(a_1)=f(a_2): h(a_1,a_2)\in U\}=(f\times f)(h^{-1}(U))$$ is open, so $g$ is continous. 
I think this is a right direction, but without the open map assumption, $g$ may not be continous. If we change $D^2$ by $D^1$ , it is easy --- a mathmatical analysis exercise using argument of extreme value. It is very `topological', since whether there exists a 2-to-1 map are highly depends on the topological properties of space. And I guess the answer should not be true (at least the last one). But I do not figure out the answer yet. 
I do not know even under the assumption $f$ is smooth.","['fundamental-groups', 'geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

Then let $e_1 = \delta_0.$ And hence from the statement in the last line, there exists a $\delta_1$ for which $|x^2|<\epsilon_1 = \delta_0$ Then for a given $\epsilon$ I take my $\delta = \delta_1$ .

3406283,Why do we need the local triviality condition when working with vector bundles?,"I'm currently reading through Adams' paper on the image of the J homomorphism, and wanted to brush up on vector bundles and K-theory before tackling this paper. The definition of (real) vector bundle that I'm working with is as follows: We have two topological spaces B and E and a continuous surjection $$\pi : E \to B$$ such that each fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)$ has the structure of a vector space. Furthermore, these data satisfy a ""local triviality"" or ""bundle"" condition: For every point $p \in B$ , there is an open neighborhood $U \subseteq B$ of $p$ , an integer $k \geq 0$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi : U \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \varphi^{-1}(U)$ , such that $\pi \circ \varphi(x,v) = x$ , and the map $v \mapsto \varphi(x,v)$ is an isomorphism from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to $\pi^{-1}(x)$ for each $x \in U$ . My question is why do we need this local triviality condition? If the spirit of a vector bundle is to continuously parameterize a family of vector spaces by B, then the local triviality condition shouldn't be necessary. I believe that this condition rules out some nasty examples of things that we might not want to think about, like a vector bundle where all of the vector spaces $\pi^{-1}(x)$ are isomorphic, except that one of them has a different orientation than the rest - the local triviality condition forbids this (I think). I originally believed that this condition was necessary for some of the constructions that we want to do with vector bundles. The direct sum, tensor product, and exterior powers of vector bundles can all be topologized using local trivializations, but we need not appeal to local trivializations in order to define their topologies - we can perform constructions analogous to those we perform in linear algebra and topologize the vector bundle $E_1 \otimes E_2$ in this way, and the two constructions turn out to be homeomorphic. Other than this, I'm a little lost. This seems like a certain brand of niceness condition, but it's unclear to me exactly what this niceness buys you. If we drop the local triviality condition from the definition of a vector bundle, what constructions and theorems do we lose, and what pathological examples do we admit?","['general-topology', 'topological-k-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'vector-bundles']"

So, I plotted Stirling Numbers of Second Kind without taking $\pmod 2$ till $n = 6$ , here is what I got: \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\

Any grid $(i,j)$ in the above matrix tells you the value of $S(i,j)$ . For the binary matrix, I wrote the decimal representation of every row starting from the first, and I got the following sequence: $$1,3,7,13,29,55,115,209,465,883,1847, \dots$$ The sequence didn't make any sense at first but when I searched for the sequence in OEIS , I got a hit and the sequence is a A bisection of  Diagonals of Pascal's triangle mod 2 interpreted as binary numbers .

I want to count how many ways are there to move from (0,0) to (x,y).
I proved there is $\sum_{i=0}^{\min(x,y)}\binom{x}{i}\binom{y}{i}2^{x+y-(i+1)}$ by combinatorial view. 
Then, can we derive this using formal power series? I've tried to derive this, however different formula appear and I cannot get the combinatorial interpretation of that formula. The number of ways to get $(x,y)$ by $n$ moves is \begin{align}
&[s^x t^y]\left(\frac{1}{1-s}\frac{1}{1-t}-1 \right)^n \\
=&[s^x t^y]\left(\frac{s+t-st}{(1-s)(1-t)}\right)^n
\end{align} Note that $[s^x t^y] f(s,t)$ is the coefficient of $s^x t^y$ term of $f(s,t)$ . Summing up for $n=1,2,...,$ we can get the number of ways to go to $(x, y)$ by arbitrary number of moves. \begin{align}
&[s^x t^y]\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{s+t-st}{(1-s)(1-t)}\right)^n \\
=&[s^x t^y]\frac{s+t-st}{1-2(s+t-st)} \\

=&\sum_{i=0}^{\min(x,y)}2^{x+y-i-1} (-1)^i \frac{(x+y-i)!}{(x-i)!(y-i)!i!}
\end{align} However, this seems different from $\sum\binom{x}{i}\binom{y}{i}2^{x+y-(i+1)}$ .
Also, I cannot come up with the combinatorial interpretation of the formula we get. UPDATE I want to explain in details for the following. \begin{align}
&[s^x t^y]\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{s+t-st}{(1-s)(1-t)}\right)^n \\

How I attempt to solve this: rewrite as $x^2-4x+4=q(x)(x^2+x-6)+r(x)$ . If we require that $r(x)$ be an integer then we can get some values of $r(x)$ by solving $x^2+x-6=0$ , so that $x=-3$ or $x=2$ . In the former case, $r=25$ , and in the latter case $r=0$ . [I should note, however, that I'm not really convinced that this step is actually correct, because when $x$ is a root of $x^2+x-6$ , the rational function above can have no remainder due to division by $0$ . But I read about it as a possible step here and I can't explain it. Q1 How can this be justified?] Now we want $(x^2+x-6)$ to divide $0$ (trivial) or $x^2+x-6$ to divide $25$ . So we set $x^2+x-6=25k$ for some integer $k$ and solve. So $$x=\frac12 (\pm5\sqrt{4k+1}-1)$$ One of the trial-and-error substitutions for $k$ and then for $x$ gives $x=-8$ , but that is just one number. Q2 : So I'm wondering, how can we find all such $x$ ? The condition here is that $4k+1$ must be a perfect square, $k\ge 0$ . Aren't there infinitely many perfect squares of this form?

3406692,Prove by induction that a checkerboard missing two squares can be covered by dominoes,"I had a lot of trouble with this induction problem from Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, 8th ed. : Use mathematical induction to show that a rectangular checkerboard with an even number of cells and two squares missing, one white and one black, can be covered by dominoes. (We can assume the board has a black-white checkerboard coloration.) For my partial attempt, I let $ P(n, k) $ be the claim that a $ 2n \times k $ checkerboard missing a white and a black cell can be covered by dominoes. I also noted that, in order for $ P(n, k) $ to be true, we must have $ n \geq 1 $ and $ k \geq 2 $ i.e. both sides of the checkerboard must have length at least 2. But after that, I wasn't sure what the basis and inductive steps would be. 
For the basis step, I proved $ P(1, 2) $ true, but I probably should've include more base cases, just didn't know which ones. The inductive step was the hardest part for me. I was fairly certain this would be a proof by strong induction, since the inductive step probably involves splitting up a checkerboard into smaller boards. The issue here is that at least one of these smaller boards will not have a black and a white cell missing, meaning we cannot directly apply the inductive hypothesis. I was also feeling iffy about applying induction on a proposition containing two variables, since we only learned how to do induction on propositions of one variable. But I couldn't figure out a formulation of the claim that uses only one variable and covers all cases for the dimensions of the board. Is there a less convoluted way of going about doing this? Did I miss something obvious? (Of course, this question is much more easily proven by a coloring argument, but it was assigned as homework in a section on induction, so we had to use that proof method.)","['induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3406761,On the Bourbaki Measures and Radon Measures,"The way that Bourbaki defined the measure is highly unusual: Let $C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ be the space of all continuous functions with compact supports. A linear functional $I$ is said to be a measure if $I:C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\rightarrow{\mathbb{R}}$ is continuous with respect to the inductive topology for $C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ : \begin{align*}
|I(f)|\leq C_{K}\sup_{x\in K}|f(x)|
\end{align*} for each compact set $K$ and $\text{supp}(f)\subseteq K$ , $C_{K}$ is a constant depending only on $K$ . Then the integral is simply defined by $I(f)$ , but Bourbaki used to write \begin{align*}
\left<f,\mu\right>=\int fd\mu
\end{align*} instead of $I$ . Folland suggests the name for Bourbaki measure as pseudo-measure, yet, he admits that there is no standard name for Bourbaki one. And he proves that \begin{align*}
I(f)=\int fd\mu_{K}
\end{align*} where $\mu_{K}$ is really the usual Radon measure that we are familiar in the sense that if the measures that we learned are from, say, Royden, Rudin references. Here $\mu_{K}$ corresponds to each $K$ , and $\mu_{K+1}|_{B(K)}=\mu_{K}$ , where $B(K)$ is the Borel subsets of $K$ . Nothing really said more about the features of the pseudo-measure by Folland. But I have ever seen some author claims that \begin{align*}
I(f)=\int fd\mu
\end{align*} for some Radon measure $\mu$ . Note that Folland does not show that there is a universal Radon measure to realize the pseudo-measure, instead, he shows that there is an ""exhaustion"" of Radon measures $\mu_{K}$ , each depends on the compact set $K$ , to have such a realization. Therefore I am doubt the author's claim that there is such a universal one. I am looking for counterexample. The best we can say is the following: Bourbaki proves that such an $I$ can have positive and negative parts: \begin{align*}
I(f)=I^{+}(f)-I^{-}(f).
\end{align*} And by usual Riesz Representation Theorem one has for some nonnegative measures $\mu_{1},\mu_{2}$ that \begin{align*}
I^{+}(f)&=\int fd\mu_{1},\\
I^{-}(f)&=\int fd\mu_{2},
\end{align*} one may think of the candidate is simply $\mu=\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$ . This may have some flaw. Recall that for a Radon measure $\mu$ one must have either for every $S$ , \begin{align*}
\mu(S)\in(-\infty,\infty]
\end{align*} or for every $S$ , \begin{align*}
\mu(S)\in[-\infty,\infty)
\end{align*} but not both. On the other hand, we cannot even be sure that $\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$ is well-defined in the sense that $\infty-\infty$ could possibly occur. This is the reason that I think the universal Radon measure may not exist, or else, the genius Folland must have proved that, for what is the point to have less user friendly, that the exhaustion of measures?","['lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
3406778,SVD of a matrix when its columns are shuffled and when certain columns are removed,"as far as I can tell, if the columns of a matrix are shuffled, an SVD would still give the same left singular vectors and eigenvalues, and a permutation (based on which column is now in which place) of the right singular vectors. I only made several trials on R, and I'm not sure if this is theoretically valid. Moreover, and more importantly, I want to find out what happens or if there is any relationship between the SVDs of a certain matrix, and when some of its columns are removed. Basically, here is what I'm trying to find out. For the first part of my question, let's say I have a matrix $\mathbf{X}$ . $\mathbf{X} = UDV^\top$ . If $\mathbf{X} = [x_1 | x_2 | x_3 | x_4 | \dots | x_{2n-1} | x_{2n}]$ , when I move every ""even"" column to the end, I get $\mathbf{Y} = [x_1 | x_3 | x_5 | \dots | x_{2n-1} \mathbf{|} x_2 | x_4 | x_6 | \dots | x_{2n}]$ . SVD of it leads to $\mathbf{Y} = UDQ^\top$ . Moreover, it seems that the rows of $Q$ are the (respectively) reshuffled rows of $V$ . I assume these are also theoretically correct. For the second part of my question, let's say, again, I have a matrix $\mathbf{X}$ . Let's also say I want to remove every second column, and perform an SVD. So, if $\mathbf{X} = [x_1 | x_2 | x_3 | x_4 | \dots | x_{2n-1} | x_{2n}]$ , and I remove every ""even"" column, I end up with $\mathbf{Y} = [x_1 | x_3 | x_5 | \dots | x_{2n-1}]$ . If, originally, $\mathbf{X} = UDV^\top$ , I want to know now what is the SVD of $\mathbf{Y}$ , if it's possible to relate it to the original? To be concise, I am trying to infer something about the components of the SVD of $\mathbf{X}$ without actually calculating its SVD, but rather only concern myself with the SVD of $\mathbf{Y}$ , because in my problem, it's extremely easier to get the SVD of $\mathbf{Y}$ , but I still kind of need information on the SVD of $\mathbf{X}$ . In short, I want to know what can be inferred from the SVD of $\mathbf{Y}$ regarding the SVD of $\mathbf{X}$ .","['matrices', 'svd']"

3406863,Scheme over a field vs. scheme defined over a field,"A scheme $X$ over another scheme $S$ is simply a morphism $X \to S$ . In particular, if $K$ is a field, a scheme $X$ over $K$ is given by a morphism $X \to \operatorname{Spec} K$ . For a long time, I conflated this with the notion of being defined over $K$ . However, the morphisms don’t even go in the right direction: For if $k \subseteq K$ is a subfield, we have a morphism $\operatorname{Spec} K \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ and composing it with our morphisms $X \to \operatorname{Spec} K$ above allows us to consider $X$ as a scheme over $k$ as well, but $X$ should not automatically be defined over every subfield (which intuitively I think of as being given by polynomial equations with coefficients in $k$ ). So here is where I am at: The question “Is (a general scheme) $X$ defined over a field $k$ ?” does not make sense. We can only ask it if $X$ is already given as a scheme over some extension $K$ of $k$ . In this case, we say that $X$ is defined over $k$ if there is a scheme $X_k$ over $k$ such that the fiber product $X_k \times_k \operatorname{Spec} K$ is $X$ (or rather, isomorphic to $X$ as a scheme over $k$ ).
