1837921,Numbers on a circle: how many arc sums can be positive?,"There are $n$ real numbers, $a_1,\dots,a_n$, arranged on a circle. Given a fixed integer $k<n$, let $S_i$ be the sum of the $k$ adjacent numbers starting at $a_i$ and counting clockwise, like this (illustrated for $k=3$): The sum of all $n$ numbers is $0$. What is the largest possible number of strictly-positive $S_i$? Here are some lower bounds: If $k\leq n/2$, then at least $n-k$ sums can be positive, e.g. when $a_1 = \cdots = a_{n-1} = 1$ and $a_n = -(n-1)$. There are $n-k$ sums that do not contain $a_n$, and they are positive. If $k\geq n/2$, then at least $k$ sums can be positive, e.g. when $a_1 = \cdots = a_{n-1} = -1$ and $a_n = +(n-1)$. There are $k$ sums that contain $a_n$, and they are positive. And here are some upper bounds: If $n$ is even and $k=n/2$, at most $n/2$ sums can be positive. This is because, if a certain sum $S_i$ is positive, then its complement sum $S_{i+k}$ must be negative (since $S_i+S_{i+k}=0$). If $k=n/3$, then at most $2n/3$ sums can be positive, since if $S_i$ and $S_{i+k}$ are positive, then $S_{i+2k}=-(S_i+S_{i+k})$ must be negative. Similarly, if $k=n/a$ for some integer $a$, then at most $(a-1)n/a$ sums can be positive. What is the general answer as a function of $k$?","['combinatorics', 'summation', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1838006,Why Differential Forms on Riemann surfaces?,"I am working with Rick Miranda's ""Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces"". Right now I am in chapter four ""Integration on Riemann Surfaces"" and struggle with it a lot!:( It starts with the definition of holomorphic 1-forms which is as follows: Definition: A holomorphic 1-form on an open set $V\subset \mathbb C$ is an expression $\omega$ of the form $$\omega=f(z)\text{dz}$$ where $f$ is a holomorphic function on $V$. We say that $\omega$ is a holomorphic 1-form in the coordinate z. -- The main problem for me is now that i can't really work with this expression. What is $\omega=f(z)\text{dz}$? Why should we define something like this/ what is the benefit from that? We already have a notion for the integral of a function on submanifolds. Why we should not apply this here? Because of this open question I am not able to understand the definitions which come later for example the following two: Definition: A $C^{\infty}$ 1-form on an open set $V\subset \mathbb C$ is an expression $\omega$ of the form $$\omega=f(z,\overline{z})\text{dz}+g(z,\overline{z})\text{d}\overline{\text{z}}$$ where $f$ and $g$ are $C^{\infty}$ function on $V$. We say that $\omega$ is a $C^{\infty}$ 1-form in the coordinate $z$. I think my problems with this definition are the same as above. Definition: A $C^{\infty}$ 2-form on an open set $V\subset \mathbb C$ is an expression $\eta$ of the form $$\eta=f(z,\overline{z})\text{dz}\wedge\text{d}\overline{\text{z}}$$
where $f$ is a $C^{\infty}$ function on $V$. We say that $\eta$ is a $C^{\infty}$ 2-form in the coordinate $z$. My additional problem/question here is: What is $\wedge?$. At this point its the first time that the author introduces this symbol. I would be very very glad if someone can make this clear for me.

I know that I need to find a polynomial $g \in K[x]$ so that $f(x) g(x) = f(x + f(x))$. So I thought that if we start with $f(x) = a_n x^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$, then if we simply substitute $x$ by $x + f(x)$, we get $f(x + f(x)) = a_n (a_n x^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0 + x)^n + \dots + a_1 (a_n x^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0 + x) + a_0$ which doesn't look all that friendly to work with.

Why can we not define an irreducible element exactly the same in a commutative ring that is not an integral domain? We have that an element is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two non-unit elements. Unit elements are well defined and unique in a commutative ring that is not an integral domain, so I cannot see that being the problem.

Can we conclude that $T_1 = 0$, $T_2 = 0$, $\dots$ or $T_n = 0$? My attempt: I could prove the statement for $n = 2$ but I couldn't generalize it, and I also couldn't find any counterexample for greater $n$. For $n = 2$, suppose $T_1 \ne 0$ and $T_2 \ne 0$. Hence there are $u$ and $v$ in $V$ such that $T_1 u \ne 0$ and $T_2 v \ne 0$. By hypothesis, we must have $T_1 v = 0$ and $T_2 u = 0$ which yield $T_1 ( u + v ) \ne 0$ and $T_2 ( u + v ) \ne 0$, contradicting the hypothesis. I also noted that my argument for $n = 2$ can be reformulated if $V$ and $W$ were just groups and $T_1$ and $T_2$ were group homomorphisms.

1838227,Generic method to distribute n distinct objects among r people such that each person gets at least one object,"Is there any generic method to solve problems of the kind - ""How many ways to distribute n distinct objects among r person(s) such that each person gets at least 1 object?"". I am aware of 2 different methods to solve this depending on the inputs - n and r. If n and r are pretty close to each other, we can find out all
mutually exclusive distribution cases, then find the number of
different ways to form such distribution groups and finally the
number of ways to distribute such distinct groups among the people.
For example, if I had to find out the number of ways I can
distribute 12 distinct objects among 9 persons such that each person
gets at least 1,then I can form 3 distribution cases - A)One person
gets 4 objects, remaining 8 gets 1 each. B)One person gets 3,another
4 and remaining 7 gets 1 each object. C)Three people gets 3 objects
each, remaining 6 people gets 1 each.I can form the group (A) in
12!/(4!8!)ways, group (B) in 12!/(3!2!7!)ways and group (C) in
12!/(2!2!2!3!6!)ways. Each of these groups can be distributed to 9
persons in 9! ways, hence the answer would be summation of
(A+B+C)*9!. This method is quicker for problems where n and r are close to each other. If say r<5 and the difference between n and r is significant, then we can solve the problem by a variant of Inclusion-Exclusion principle. For example, if I had to distribute 9 objects between 3 people such that each person gets at least 1, then we can find the total number of ways to distribute these 9 objects without any restriction i.e. $3^9$, then subtract from it the total number of ways where at least one among the 3 people doesn't get a single object i.e. in $\binom 31(2^9-2)$ ways and finally subtract the number of cases where all the objects are given to a single person in $\binom 31$ ways. Hence the answer will be $3^9-\binom 31(2^9-2)-3$. This method seems quicker for problems where r is small. But I would like to know a generic method to approach this problem irrespective of the values of n and r, which yields quicker results. I also know if the objects are identical then we can construct a generating function G(x) and then find the co-efficient of $x^n$ which will give us all possible ways of distributing n identical objects. I would appreciate if anyone can guide to me to a generic solution for distinct objects.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'combinations']"

Otherwise, there exists an increasing sequence $\{g_n \}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\in L^{+}$ that converges to $g$, so that $\{fg_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $fg$ and hence $$\int g d\lambda = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int g_n d\lambda = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int f g_n d\mu = \int f g d\mu$$ I am pretty sure this is correct, I just don't understand how $$\int f \chi_{F}d\mu = \int (\sum_{1}^{\infty}\chi_{E_n}f)d\mu$$ Also I do not understand the last part starting with otherwise that I found online.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

I'm not looking for the answer, I'd just like some pointers on what I need to do, and how I should go about enumerating the elements. Enumerate the elements of the following relations from the set A of positive integers less than or equal to 10 to the set B of positive
  integers less than or equal to 30. An element a of A is related to the element b of B if b = 3 Ã a R=(1,3)(2,6)(3,9)(4,12)(5,15)(6,18)7,21)(8,24)(9,27)(10,30) An element a of A is related to the element b of B if b = 2 Ã a - 1 R=(1,1)(2,3)(3,5)(4,7)(5,9)(6,11)(7,13)(8,15)(9,17)(10,19) At first I thought I'd just have the two sets:
A = {1,2 3 ,4 5 ... 10 }
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 30 } so would I just take a (lets say 1) and b (1 again)
1 = 3 * 1 (obviously false)? and continue on for each element in both sets?

1838848,"Derivative of the magnitude of a vector. Does it exist, or not?","I have a puzzling situation involving derivatives. I want to derivate:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}| \mathbf F(x)|
$$ This was actually something involving physics. Lets be 2-dimensional for simplicity. Let a particle be at position $\mathbf r = (x, y)$. The distance $s$ of the particle from point $(0, 0)$ is simply $s = |\mathbf r|$. I want to calculate how that distance changes over time.
$$
\frac{ds}{dt} = 
\frac{d}{dt}|\mathbf r| = 
\frac{d}{dt}\sqrt{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2} = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2}}\left(x\frac{dx}{dt} + y\frac{dy}{dt}\right) = \frac{1}{|\mathbf r|}\left(x\frac{dx}{dt} + y\frac{dy}{dt}\right) 
$$ As you can see, $ds/dt$ is not defined when $|\mathbf r| = 0$. I can't see why. On physics point of view, the particle should always travel continuously in the plane (assuming the path it makes is continuous and fully differentiable). Why is the distance variation undefined? Assume for instance, I have a table, and $(x, y)$ is the position of my fingers. I can't see why it wouldn't exist. Hypothesis: Notice that, by description I told, the curve $(x, y)$ is continuous on all points, and smooth/differentiable on all points. Thus, $x(t), y(t), x'(t), y'(t)$ is well defined, for all points. If you want, consider them to be class $C^\infty$. My question : Does this derivative exist or not when $|\mathbf r| = 0$? What is the value/evaluation of such derivative in an arbitrary given period $t_0$ when $|\mathbf r| = 0$? Considering $x(t) = t^2$ and $y(t) = t^2$, we get $s$ proportional to $t^2$, and thus its derivative exists at $t=0$ with the derivative having a well defined value of zero.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'calculus']"
1838860,Polynomial ring with arbitrarily many variables in ZF,"For a given field $k$ and a set $X$ we want to define the ring $k[X]$ of polynomials with $X$ as the set of variables. We do not assume $X$ to be finite. And we want to do this without employing axiom of choice. Informally, the elements of $k[X]$ will be finite sums of monomials of the form $cx_1^{k_1}\dots x_n^{k_n}$ , where each monomial is determined by a coefficient $c\in k$ , finitely many elements $x_1,\dots,x_n\in X$ and the exponents $k_1,\dots,k_n$ , which are positive integers. Addition and multiplication of polynomials from $k[X]$ will be defined in the natural way. However, we also should be able to describe this algebraic structure more formally. Especially if we are trying to use it in some proof in the axiomatic system ZF. In this case it is also important to check that we have not used AC anywhere in the proof. (Using Axiom of Choice can easily be overlooked, especially if somebody is used to work in ZFC rather than ZF, i.e., without the restriction that AC should be avoided.) To explain a bit better what I mean, this is similar to defining the polynomial ring $k[x]$ of polynomials in a single variable $x$ . Informally, we view polynomials as expressions of the form $a_nx^n+\dots+a_1x+a_0$ (with $a_i\in k$ ). And we will also write them in this way. But formally they are sequences of elements of $K$ with finite support. I will also provide below a suggestion how to construct $k[X]$ in ZF. I would be interested in any comments on my approach, but also if there are different ways to do this, I'd be glad to hear about them. This cropped up in a discussion with some colleagues of mine. Transfinite induction and direct limit One colleague suggested the following approach, which clearly uses AC (in the form of the well-ordering theorem ). But he said that this is the construction of $k[X]$ which seems the most natural to him. We take any well-ordering of the set $X=\{x_\beta; \beta<\alpha\}$ . By a transfinite induction we define rings $k_\beta$ for $\beta\le\alpha$ and also an embeddings $k_\beta \hookrightarrow k_{\beta'}$ for any $\beta<\beta'<\alpha$ . The ring $k_\beta$ is supposed to represent the polynomials using only variables $x_\gamma$ for $\gamma\le\beta$ . We put $k_0=k[x_0]$ . Similarly if $\beta$ is a successor ordinal we can define $k_\beta=k_{\beta-1}[x_\beta]$ . If $\beta$ is a limit ordinal, then we can take $k_\beta$ as a direct limit of $k_\gamma$ , $\gamma<\beta$ . Then the ring $k_\alpha$ is $k[X]$ which we wanted to construct. It is not immediately clear to me whether the proof can be simplified in the way that the direct limit can be replaced by union. However, I do not consider this to be an important difference, since using direct limit (especially in such a simple case, with linear order and embeddings) seem to me to be a rather standard approach for this type of constructions. And anybody with enough mathematical maturity to study a proofs of this level will probably not have a problem with the notion of direct limit. The fact that this is indeed a ring (or even integral domain) follows from the fact that these properties are preserved by this simple version of direct limits. (I.e., direct limit based on linearly ordered system of rings with embeddings between them. This does not differ substantially from the proof that union of chain of rings is a ring.) Functions with finite support I have suggested this approach, which is more closely modeled after the case of ring in a single variable. Unless I missed something, this can be done in ZF, i.e., without use of ZFC. Let us first try to definite the set $M$ of all monomials of the form $x_1^{k_1}\dots x_n^{k_n}$ . (I.e., the monomials with the coefficient $1$ .) Every such monomial is uniquely determined by a finite subset $F\subseteq X$ and a function $g: F\mapsto\mathbb N$ , where $\mathbb N=\{1,2,\dots\}$ . Or, if you will, $\mathbb N=\omega\setminus\{0\}$ . (Since we are talking about finite sets, it might be worth mentioning that there are several notions of finite set in ZF . We take the standard one, which is sometimes called Tarski-finite or Kuratowski-finite. This notion of finiteness is well behaved. For our purposes it is important to know that union of finite set of finite sets is again finite and the same is true for Cartesian product.) So we can get $M$ as a set of all pairs $(F,g)$ with the properties described above. Existence of such sets can be defined in ZF in a rather straightforward manner. (All properties of $F$ and $g$ can be described by a formula in a language of set theory. Clearly $F\in\mathcal P(X)$ . Or we can use the set $\mathcal P^{<\omega}(X)$ of finite subsets of $X$ instead. The function $g$ belongs to the set of all functions from such $F$ 's to $\mathbb N$ . For each $F$ we have the set $\mathbb N^F$ consisting of all functions $F\to\mathbb N$ . Then we can simply take the union $G=\bigcup\limits_{F\in\mathcal P(X)} \mathbb N^F$ , based on axiom of union. The we use axiom scheme of specification to get only those pairs from $\mathcal P(X)\times G$ which have the required properties.) Now we have the set $M$ . We want to model somehow the finite sums of elements from $M$ multiplied by a coefficents from $k$ . To this end we simply take the functions from $M$ to $k$ with finite support. So far we have only defined the underlying set $k[X]$ . We still need to define addition, multiplication, verify that this is integral domain. However, any polynomial $p\in k[X]$ only uses finitely many variables, since we have finitely many monomials and each of them only contains finitely many variables. If we are verifying closure under addition or multiplication, or some properties of integral domain such as associativity or distributivity, then any such condition only includes finitely many polynomials and thus we have only finitely many variables. So we can look at this condition as property of polynomials in $k[F]$ , where $F$ is some finite subsets. Assuming we already know that polynomial ring in finitely many variables over a field $k$ is an integral domain, this argument can be used to argue that $k[X]$ is an integral domain, too. The above discussion occurred in connection with the proof of Andreas Blass' result that existence of Hamel basis for vector space over arbitrary fields implies Axiom of Choice. This proof can be found for example in the references below. It is also briefly described in this answer . In this proof the polynomials from $k[X]$ are used. (Then the field $k(X)$ of all rational functions in variables from $X$ is created - in the other words, the quotient field of $k[X]$ . And the proof than uses existence of a Hamel basis of $k(X)$ considered as a vector space over a particular subfield of $k(X)$ .) Unless I missed something, the proofs given there do not discuss whether $k[X]$ can be constructed without AC. Which suggests that the authors considered this point to be simple enough to be filled in by a reader. So I assume that proof of this fact should not be too difficult. (Of course, if you know of another reference for a proof this results which also discusses this issue, I'd be glad to learn about it.) A. Blass: Existence of bases implies the axiom of choice.

However, it is not discussed there whether AC was used somewhere in this construction.","['polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

1838864,vacuous truth -> empty set is both included and not included in every set?,"I understand the concept of vacuous truth and its use in showing that the empty set is a subset of every set. Based on my understanding of vacuous truth (for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth ) we have $\forall x \in \varnothing: P(x)$ or $\forall x(x \in \varnothing \implies P(x))$ Now $P(x)$ can be $x \in A$ so $\forall x (x \in \varnothing \implies x \in A)$. This establishes that $\varnothing \subset A$ (so the empty set is a subset of any set $A$). However, my understanding is that it doesn't really matter what $P(x)$ is---the vacuous truth holds regardless (I find this quite obvious from what the vacuous truth is and how it works; wikipedia illustrates that if there are no phones in a room then we can say either 1) all phones are on or 2) all phones are off or even 3) all phones are both on and off). Therefore $P(x)$ can instead be $x \notin A$ and we have $\forall x (x \in \varnothing \implies x \notin A)$. It seems to me this is just as vacuously true. But then this would mean that the empty set is not a subset of any set $A$ ($\varnothing \not \subset A$) (along with being a subset of any $A$). If this is so then: Why is only the $\varnothing \subset A$ part mentioned (I've never seen $\varnothing \not \subset A$ stated)? If both $\varnothing \subset A$ and $\varnothing \not \subset A$ are (vacuously) true then how can any coherent statement or proof be based on any of them? Further, if $\varnothing \subset A$ is true ""above"" $\varnothing \not \subset A$ then doesn't that require a proof beyond merely vacuous truth? Lastly, can we extrapolate this further and say that both $\forall x(x \in \varnothing \implies x = x)$ and $\forall x(x\in \varnothing \implies x \neq x)$ are vacuously true? This should be simple and clear so I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Thanks! (PS I did search for for this before posting and the closest I came to was Is this statement ""Every element in the empty set is greater than itself."" true or its negation is true? which is really a different case where $\neg \forall x \in \varnothing : P(x)$ is negated to become $\exists x : P(x)$.

1839114,Semi-finite trace on a von Neumann algebra: Equivalent definitions,"Let $(N,\tau)$ be a semi-finite von Neumann algebra. This means that $\tau$ is a normal, faithful and semi-finite trace. Normality means that $\tau(x) = \sup_i \tau(x_i)$ if $x \in N_+$ is the limit of an increasing net $x_i$ in $N_+$. With $\tau$ one associates the following sets: $$
N_\tau^+ := \{x \in N_+ : \tau(x) < \infty \}
$$
and 
$$
 \mathscr L_\tau^1(N) := \{ x \in N : \tau(\lvert x \rvert) < \infty \}.
$$
The latter set is in fact a $*$-ideal and equals the complex linear span of $N_\tau^+$. I read a few definitions of semi-finiteness and I wonder if these are all equivalent. Lets recall a few definitions: Every $0 \neq x \in N_+$ majorizes some $0 \neq y \in N_\tau^+$. (Takesaki: Theory of Operator Algebras I, p. 309) $\tau(x) = \sup \{ \tau(y) : y \leq x, \ y \in N_\tau^+ \}$ for $x \in N_+$. (Dixmier: von Neumann algebras p. 93) The $\sigma$-weak (=ultra weak) closure of $N_\tau^+$ equals $N_+$. (A. M. Bimkchentaev: On a Property of $L^p$ Spaces on Semifinite von Neumann Algebras) For all $x \in N_+$ there exists an increasing net $x_\alpha$ in $N_\tau^+$ with strong (SOT) limit $x$. (Edward Nelson: Notes on Non-commutative Integration) I hope that all these definitions are equivalent for a normal tracial weight $\tau$ on a von Neumann algebra. By tracial I mean that $\tau(x^*x) = \tau(xx^*)$ for all $x \in N$. I am also wondering if the normality may be dropped to see the equivalence.

1839192,"Universal property, localization of rings and modules, and initial element in a category","Sorry for the confusing title. I just started learning category theory and am very confused about the concept ""universal property"". I am not even sure whether my ""proof"" is a proof or is just a restating of the original problem. Here is a problem from Vakil's notes of Algebraic Geometry. Exercise 1.3.D. Verify that $A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$ satisfies the following universal property: $S^{-1}A$ is initial among $A$-algebras $B$ where every element of $S$ is sent to an invertible element in $B$. My attempt: I searched and found this question on MSE: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1816224/localization-and-the-universal-property?rq=1 . So I constructed my ""proof"" based on that: We consider a category $\mathscr{C}$ with objects as pairs of, e.g., $(S^{-1}A, A\xrightarrow{i_s} S^{-1}A), (B, A\xrightarrow{\pi_B} B), (C, A\xrightarrow{\pi_C} C)$. The objects are pairs whose first components are $A$-algebras, and second components are ring maps from $A$ to the corresponding $A$-algebras, in which elements from $S$ are sent to an invertible element. Notice that $S$ is in $A$. For any two objects $B, C$, the morphisms are ring maps between $B$ and $C$. We have the following diagram: We see that any map $\pi: A\rightarrow B$ where every element of $S$ is sent to an invertible element must factor uniquely through $i_s: A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$. My question: Could anyone verify my ""proof""? I am not sure how this universal property could be used. Edit: According to @Hoot's suggestion, I will define $\phi$ and prove that it is unique. Define $\phi: S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$ by $\phi(a/s)=\pi(a)\pi(s)^{-1}$, for $s\in S, a\in A$. We prove that $\phi$ is well-defined. Let $a_1/s_1=a_2/s_2$, i.e., $s(a_1s_2-a_2s_1)=0$ for some $s\in S$. This implies $\pi(a_1s_2-a_2s_1)=0$. We have $\phi(a_1/s_1)=\pi(a_1)\pi(s_1)^{-1}, \phi(a_2/s_2)=\pi(a_2)\pi(s_2)^{-1}$. Apparently they are equal. By some similar computations we can prove it is a ring homomorphism. It remains to show that $\phi$ is unique. Let $\psi: S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$ be another ring homomorphism, such that $\pi=\psi\circ i_s$. Then $\pi(a)=\psi(a)$ for all $a\in A$. Since it is homomorphism, $\psi(a/s)=\psi(a)\psi(s)^{-1}=\pi(a)\pi(s)^{-1}$. This shows that $\psi=\phi$. Another question: In the notes the author says every map $A\rightarrow B$ that sends elements in $S$ to an invertible element factors uniquely through $A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$. I'm still confused about this sentence. Shouldn't we say it factors uniquely through $S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$, since that is the unique universal map?

The sequence is called an exact sequence if the maps are exact at $V_i$ for all $i$.  $\dots$ If $V_1, V_2$ and $V_3$ are three vector spaces, and if the sequence $$0 \stackrel{\varphi_0}{\longrightarrow} V_{1} \stackrel{\varphi_{1}}{\longrightarrow} V_2 \stackrel{\varphi_{2}}{\longrightarrow} V_{3} \stackrel{\varphi_{3}}{\longrightarrow} 0 \tag{1.7}$$ is exact, it is called a short exact sequence .

If the image of any function in this sequence is the kernel of the next function, doesn't every step of this just map to $0$?  And even if it didn't, because we're starting with the $0$ vector space, everything has to map to $0$ because linear transformations always map $0$ to $0$.  So I'm not understanding this definition at all.  The first exercise right below these definitions is to show that equation $(1.7)$ implies that $\varphi_1$ is injective and $\varphi_2$ is surjective.

Now consider a sequence of $k$ flips $f_1, \cdots, f_k$ of the list $[1, \cdots, n]$ such that $f_1(f_2(\cdots f_k([1,\cdots,n])\cdots)) = [1,\cdots, n]$, i.e. performing all flips gives the original list. Then $k$ must be even. I would like to find a proof of this proposition that is elementary as possible. I already came up with a justification using permutation groups which goes as follows: Each flip $f_i$ corresponds to a transposition of the list $[1, \cdots, n]$. Since the composition $f_1f_2\cdots f_k$ results in the identity, it must be an even permutation. Thus any representation of $f_1f_2\cdots f_k$  as a product of transpositions must contain an even number of transpositions. In particular, since each $f_i$ is a transposition, it follows that $k$ must be even. This ""proof"" trivializes the problem statement as it is by using relatively high-powered facts about permutation groups. Is there a lower-level proof that avoids using theses results? (Ideally such a proof would avoid permutation groups altogether and be understandable to the layman.) Edit: to clarify (since this question hasn't been getting as much attention as I had hoped), any proof that avoids re-deriving these powerful results about permutations would suffice. Basically I would want a proof that does not prove much more than the question requires, i.e. doesn't have a part where it says ""in particular"".","['parity', 'alternative-proof', 'abstract-algebra', 'permutations', 'symmetric-groups']"

Is there a simple relation between these two mathematical constructs? are both the same? is one just a specialization (for a certain operation) case of the other? Is one a field and the other just a ring for example? Is the difference the partial vs. total order?,"['nonstandard-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'definition']"

1839562,Does this inequality involving inverse tangent (arctan) hold?,"I am wondering if the following statement is true for $\theta\in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ and $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$: $$\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin(\theta)+x}{\cos(\theta)+y}\right)\leq\theta+x\cos(\theta)-y\sin(\theta)+c(x^2+y^2),$$ where $c\geq2$ is a constant (though an answer showing that constant $c$ exists without quantifying what it is would be good enough). I've plotted the difference between RHS and LHS for multiple values of $\theta$ and the inequality seems to hold.  However, I have no idea how to prove this, as my usual method of Taylor series expansion (around $(x,y)=(0,0)$ does not seem to work here (the series converges only for $|x|,|y|<1$).  Can anyone help? If the above inequality holds, I think that it would solve this question .","['inequality', 'trigonometry']"
1839585,"two metrics on X such that lim d1(xn,x)=0 <=> lim d2(xn,x)=0, does it imply the identity of the two induced topologies?","Two metrics $d_1, d_2$ on $X$
For all $x_n, x$ from $X$ it holds:

I have two definition of metric for compact convergence.
$X=C(IR,E)$ all continuous functions from $IR$ to $E$, where $E$ is a metric space with metric $q$ $d_1(f,g)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{-i} * \sup \{q(f(x),g(x)) :x \in [0, i] \} $ $d_2(f,g)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \min \{2^{-i}, sup(q(f(x),g(x)) : x\in [0, i]) \} $ $\lim d_1(f_n,f)=0 \iff$ For all compact subset $K$ of $X$: $f_n$ converge uniformly to $f$ on $K \iff

1839598,Find roots of polynomial in a finite field,"I need to build a field $L$ of 121 elements and find how many roots polynomial $g=x^9-1$ has in $L$. Then to find all these roots. So, $121=11^2$ this is power of prime. We can build finite field of 121 elements by finding normal irreducible polynomial of of power 2. We can see that $x^9-1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)(x^6+x^3+1)$, lets take $h=x^2+x+1$ as irreducible since it does not have natural roots in $Z_{11}$. We can build the field $L=\{k\alpha+b + h(\alpha), k,b \in Z_{11}\}$ Instantly we can see that 1 is the root of $g$ because of $(x-1)$. Am I right so far? How can I find other roots of $g$ or at least find their conunt?","['number-theory', 'finite-fields', 'irreducible-polynomials']"
1839605,"Is there a measure space $(X,\mathcal M, m)$ such that $\{m(E) \mid E \in \mathcal M\} = \Bbb Q_{\geq 0} \cup \{+\infty\}$?","I have in mind the following question: Is there a measure space $(X,\mathcal M, m)$ such that the range of $m$ satisfies $S:=\{m(E) \mid E \in \mathcal M\} = \Bbb Q_{\geq 0} \cup \{+\infty\}$? (I would also accept a space where $\Bbb Q_{\geq 0} \cup \{+\infty\}$ is replaced by $\Bbb Q_{\geq 0}\,$.) An idea would be to take $X=\Bbb N$ and define $m(\{n\}):=r_n$ the $n$-th positive rational number. But then $m(\{k(n) \in X \mid r_n=1/n^2, n\geq 0\})=\pi^2/6$ is not rational. So the measurable sets corresponding to $1/n^2$ shouldn't be disjoint.
To avoid this, we could demand that some fixed element $x_0$ belongs to every non-empty measurable set. But this is not possible since $\mathcal M$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, in particular it is closed under taking complements. Similarly, if $(x_n)$ is any sequence of positive rational numbers that converges to $\sqrt 2$, the measurable sets corresponding to $x_n$ shouldn't included one in another (to avoid a chain).
I could replace $\pi^2/6$ and $\sqrt 2$ by any positive real number (since $\Bbb Q$ is dense in the reals)! Therefore, my intuition is that such a measure space can't exist. Actually, I believe that the set $S$ defined above should be closed in $\Bbb R \cup \{+\infty\} \cong S^1$ (and even ""closed under taking series"" with elements in $S$). But I'm unsure if this is true, and how to prove it. Any comment would be appreciated!","['examples-counterexamples', 'measure-theory']"
1839608,Demystifying the tensor product,"It seems to me, through my mathematical immaturity, that the tensor product seems to beg for more well-definition. I am working in vector spaces (so we always have a free module) and here is what my professor has shown me thus far. We can define the tensor product of two maps (multi-linear) as follows. Let $S \in \mathcal{L}(V_1, \dots, V_n; \mathcal{L}(W;,Z))$ and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V_{n+1}, \dots , V_{n+m};W)$ , We define $S \otimes T \in \mathcal{L}(V_1, \dots , V_{n+m};Z)$ by setting $$S \otimes T(v_1, \dots ,v_{n+m})=S(v_1, \dots, v_n)[T(v_{n+1}, \dots , v_{n+m})]$$ Now, we do have $\mathcal{L}(V_1, \dots , V_{n+m};Z) \cong V^*_1 \otimes \dots \otimes V^*_{n+m} \otimes Z$ I believe. So it is, up to isomorphism, a tensor but not, itself, a tensor. Further, suppose that $V_1, \dots , V_n$ are vector spaces. We define the tensor product $$V_1 \otimes \dots \otimes V_n = \mathcal{L}(V^*_1, \dots V^*_n; \mathbb{F})$$ Since we regard $V$ and $V^{**}$ to be identified we have $$v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_n \in V_1 \otimes \dots \otimes V_n$$ defined $$(v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_n)(L_1, \dots L_n)=L_1(v_1)\dots L_n(v_n)$$ Finally, we have defined a tensor of type $m,n$ to be a multi-linear map from $\underbrace{V^* \times \dots \times V^*}_{m \text{ times}}\times \underbrace{V \times \dots \times V}_{n \text{ times}} \to \mathbb{F}$ . problem So it seems to me that tensor products do not always produce tensors? That a tensor product sometimes is and sometimes is not a map to the field? Which makes me wonder how we can consider the idea to be well-defined? I have to be told by some to think about it in terms of the universal property, i.e., it takes multi-linear maps to linear ones but that isn't as illuminating as some may think. How is one to think about this product and these objects? Thanks for your help!","['linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'multilinear-algebra']"
