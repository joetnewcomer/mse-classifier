632043,Why is raising by $(p-1)/2$ not always equal to $1$ in $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$? (Manipulating powers modulo p),"tl;dr: why is raising by $(p-1)/2$ not always equal to $1$ in $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$? I was studying the proof of why generators do not have quadratic residues and I stumbled in one step on the proof that I thought might be a good question that might help other people in the future when raising powers modulo $p$. Let $p$ be prime and as usual, $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$ be the integers mod $p$ with inverses. Consider raising the generator $g$ to the power of $(p-1)/2$: $$g^{(p-1)/2}$$ then, I was looking for a somewhat rigorous argument (or very good intuition) on why that was not always equal to $1$ by fermat's little theorem (when I say always, I mean, even when you do NOT assume the generator has a quadratic residue). i.e. why is this logic flawed: $$ g^{(p-1)/2} = (g^{(p-1)})^{\frac{1}{2}} = (1)^{\frac{1}{2}} \ (mod \ p)$$ to solve the last step find an x such that $1 = x \ (mod \ p)$. $x$ is obviously $1$, which completes the wrong proof that raising anything to $(p-1)/2$ is always equal to $1$. This obviously should not be the case, specially for a generator since the only power that should yield $1$ for a generator is $p-1$, otherwise, it can't generate one of the elements in the cyclic set. The reason that I thought that this was illegal was because you can only raise to powers of integers mod $p$ and $1/2$ is obviously not valid (since its not an integer). Also, if I recall correctly, not every number in a set has a k-th root, right? And $1/2$ actually just means square rooting...right? Also, maybe it was a notational confusion where to the power of $1/2$ actually just means a function/algorithm that ""finds"" the inverse such that $z = x^2 \ (mod \ p)$. So is the illegal step claiming that you can separate the powers because at that step, you would be raising to the power of an element not allowed in the set?","['quadratic-residues', 'elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
632097,Diophantine quartic equation in four variables,"Comments from a recent Question, Cyclic quadrilateral with equal area and perimeter , ask about such cases with (positive) integer lengths. Using Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (which generalizes Heron's formula for area of a triangle), we can get a Diophantine equation in positive integer unknowns $w,x,y,z$: $$ wxyz = (w+x+y+z)^2 $$ I'll provide the derivation below as a Community Wiki.

632266,Must a curve of constant width be generated with an odd number of sides?,"From what I have seen (and to some extend read), a curve of constant width generated from a polygon with an even number of sides is not possible. Wikipedia cites an Oxford University paper when it says Curves of constant width can be generated by joining circular arcs centered on the vertices of a regular or irregular convex polygon with an odd number of sides (triangle, pentagon, heptagon, etc.) It says curves of width can be generated with polygons with an odd number of sides, it does not explicitly rule out even numbers of sides. I suppose this can be asked in two questions: Question 1 Are all curves of constant width generateable with the ""Reaulaux Method""? It seems that every document I read mentions curves of constant width generated with circular arcs, which does make sense. Is this the only possible method? Examples can be seen on the Wikipedia Article . I'm going to say that a circle can be generated with this method as well. What is the justification for the correct answer? Question 2 Must a curve of constant width be generated with an odd number of sides? This question is harder to answer if the answer to question 1 is no, so if that is the case this can be left out (unless it is still easy to answer, that is). Mrf's answer provided insight that could be lead to a proof that regular polygons used to generate with the ""Reulaux Method"" must have an odd number of sides, but is this also true for irregular polygons?

I want to prove that $F$ itself is representable by a closed $k$-subscheme $Z\hookrightarrow G$ via descent theory and approximation results, and I'm not sure I'm going about it the right way. Since $Z_{k_s}$ is of finite presentation over $k_s$, results on inductive limits show that there is a finite separable extension $k^\prime$ and a closed subscheme $Z_{k^\prime}\hookrightarrow G_{k^\prime}$ that becomes isomorphic to $Z_{k_s}$ upon base change to $k_s$. In this generality, is there any reason to believe that $Z_{k^\prime}$ represents the restriction $F_{k^\prime}$ of $F$ to $k^\prime$-schemes? If $G$ is affine (and so all other schemes under consideration are affine), then my understanding is that faithfully flat descent relative to the extension $k_s/k$ is effective (because the condition about coverings by open affine subschemes stable under the descent datum is trivially satisfied), and in this case one can descend $Z_{k_s}$ uniquely to $k$ (without the intermediate field $k^\prime$), and I think that the descended scheme will represent $F$ (based on Stacks Tag 02W5 , which admittedly I don't fully understand. If the schemes under consideration are not affine, then I don't think descent relative to the extension $k_s/k$ is necessarily effective, and so my thought was that one must first descend to a finite separable extension $k^\prime$ (which can be taken Galois) using considerations with inductive limits, and then try to apply ``Galois descent"" relative to $k^\prime/k$ by establishing the relevant Galois equivariance to ensure effectivity of descent. But again, I don't understand why the object constructed over $k^\prime$ should represent $F_{k^\prime}$. I apologize for this somewhat imprecise question.

Please bear in mind I've only taken a Real Analysis course.

With that in mind, I ask the following questions: What does it mean, precisely, to take infinite sums, if we are to accept $1+2+3+...=-1/12$? What does $=$ means, precisely, in this context?

So for the beginning of B or D i get a total of 2*A(n-1).
But if the word starts with A, there could be only C or A after this letter. if it's C we continue regularly and say the continuation has A(n-2) combinations. But if there is an A after the A, we have the same situation repeats and repeats until the last letter. so we get for this :
A(n-2)+A(n-3)+...+A1 If the word starts with B we get the same combinations as it starts with A so again :

Improve this question Cantor's diagonalization theorem, which proves that the reals are uncountable, is a study in contrasts.  On the one hand, there is no question that it is correct.  On the other hand, not only is it controversial, it attracts an inordinate number of cranks.  Asaf Karagila compiles an excellent list of various ""cranky"" questions here . I have come to the conclusion that math populizers have incorrectly concluded that the proof of Cantor diagonalization is accessible.  For example, see this in the popular business press.  My view is that all such ""populist"" proofs assume way too many sophisticated mathematical proofs to be viable. Specifically, the standard Cantor proof assumes, without statement, that: countable sets are enumerable; i.e. can be put into a sequence sequences are valid ways to define new numbers (limits, sums), despite the fact that they contain an infinite number of terms the constructed real not in the list of ""countable"" reals is the limit of a Cauchy sequence, and is therefore a real number and not rational (which explicitly references the completeness of the reals) So my question is on either side of my examples: Given my protestation, is the standard proof by contradiction salvageable for non-mathematicians; and What amount of rigorous mathematics is needed to make this proof ""crank proof""?  I would say what I have provided is sufficient, realizing that serious cranks are impervious to anything not in their thinking! EDIT: Thanks for the answers.

This is where I think we mathematicians are wrong, at least for some people.  I think lots of people doubt the existence of any such infinite object which seem to require an infinite construction, like Cantor.  Specific reals, like $\pi$, have other definitions that seem ""non-infinite"".

633305,Solving an integral coming from Perron's formula,"In analytic number theory, Perron's formula says that 
$$
\sum_{1 \leq k < n} a_k + \frac{1}{2}a_n = \int_{c - i\infty}^{c+i\infty} f(s)\frac{n^s}{s}ds, 
$$
where $f(s) = \sum_{k \geq 1} a_k/k^s$ and $c$ is greater than the abscissa of convergence 
of $f(s)$.  My question is whether Perron's formula can be used as the first step in a derivation of the formula for 
a sum of powers of the first $n$ integers. Specifically, for any positive integer $m$, Perron's formula 
for $f(s) = \zeta(s-m) = \sum_{k \geq 1} k^m/k^s$ says 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k^m = \frac{1}{2}n^m+\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\zeta(s-m)\frac{n^s}{s}ds$$ 
for any $c>m+1$.  The integrand $\zeta(s-m)n^s/s$ has poles at $s = 0$ and $s = m+1$. If we formally shift the line of integration to the left across the pole at $s = m+1$, then a formal use of the residue theorem gives us 
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k^m = \frac{1}{m+1}n^{m+1} + \frac{1}{2}n^m+\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{b-i\infty}^{b+i\infty}\zeta(s-m)\frac{n^s}{s}ds
$$ 
for $b < m+1$.  When $m-1/2 < b < m+1$, I can justify this shift (i.e., if I truncate the integral on the top and bottom and make a rectangle 
with sides along $x = c$ and $x = b$, the integrals along the top and bottom go to 0 as the height of the rectangle goes to $\pm \infty$).
The two powers of $n$ on the right side are exactly the first two dominant terms in the standard formula for power sums 
in terms of Bernoulli numbers: 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k^m =  \sum_{j=0}^{m} \dbinom{m}{j}\frac{B_{m-j}}{j+1}n^{j+1} = 
\frac{1}{m+1}n^{m+1}+\frac{1}{2}n^m + \sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \dbinom{m}{j}\frac{B_{m-j}}{j+1}n^{j+1}. 
$$
What I'd like to know is if anyone sees a way to extract all lower order terms in this standard formula from the integral 
along the line ${\rm Re}(s) = b$ when $m-1/2 < b  < m+1$. That is, could one show
$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{b-i\infty}^{b+i\infty}\zeta(s-m)\frac{n^s}{s}ds = \sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \dbinom{m}{j}\frac{B_{m-j}}{j+1}n^{j+1}
$$
by some method that is independent of knowledge of the power sum formula? 
For concreteness, the first four cases of the standard power sum formula are 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=1}^n k &=& \frac{1}{2}n^2+\frac{1}{2}n, \\
\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 &=& \frac{1}{3}n^3+\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{6}n, \\
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 &=& \frac{1}{4}n^4+\frac{1}{2}n^3 + \frac{1}{4}n^2, \\ 
\sum_{k=1}^n k^4 &=& \frac{1}{5}n^5+\frac{1}{2}n^4 + \frac{1}{3}n^3-\frac{1}{30}n.
\end{eqnarray*}
So when $m=1$ the integral is 0, when $m=2$ the integral is $\frac{1}{6}n$, when 
$m = 3$ the integral is $\frac{1}{4}n^2$, and when $m = 4$ the integral is $\frac{1}{3}n^3 - \frac{1}{30}{n}$.
Is there a way to evaluate the integral directly to recover these computations (thereby leading to an alternate proof of the 
power sum formula)?  Or is there at least a way to see that the integral is $O(n^{m-1})$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$? The obvious thing to try is to push the contour further to the left, past more poles.  Even if that could be justified (is it valid?), the only pole remaining in $\zeta(s-m)n^s/s$ is at $s = 0$, where the residue is $\zeta(-m) = -B_{m+1}/(m+1)$, which doesn't involve $n$ and is not even a term in the power sum formula.  Without poles to work with, I don't see a way to extract any lower order terms from the integral.","['analytic-number-theory', 'complex-analysis', 'number-theory']"
633307,Definition of star in a simplicial complex,"Given a simplicial complex K and a collection of simplices S in K, the star of S is defined as the set of all simplices that have a face in S. Now consider the following picture (from wikipedia): In the picture, S consists of the yellow point and its star is shown in green on the right. Now it appears that this is somewhat of a convention, but the edges which are opposite of S in the green triangles are not part of the star of S. I find this confusing because I thought that they were parts of 2-simplices, the triangles which are shaded. The edges, when considered as 1-simplices in their own right, certainly do not contain S as a face, but the 2-simplices which contain them do contain S as a face. So, a question. In diagrams like this, why do we exclude edges like this from the star? Aren't each of them a part of a 2-simplex which contains S?","['algebraic-topology', 'combinatorics']"
633313,Is there a field of 'real analytic geometry'?,"I am wondering whether there is a field of 'real analytic geometry', and if not, why not? There are branches of geometry corresponding to increasingly large sets of functions: polynomial (algebraic geometry), analytic (complex geometry), differentiable (differential geometry), continuous (topology). 'Shapes' defined by analytic functions are studied in complex geometry, but as far as I can see only complex-analytic functions: is there nothing to study about figures defined by real-analytic functions?","['algebraic-geometry', 'big-picture', 'differential-geometry']"
