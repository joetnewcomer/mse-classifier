1298914,Review on Riemannian Geometry,"I'm currently reading through Griffiths and Harris Principles of Algebraic Geometry, and the only subject in the foundational material section that I am not completely comfortable with is riemannian geometry, ie. notions of curvature, connections, riemann tensor. Is there an algebraic geometry text that has a more thorough review of these notions over $\mathbb{R}$, that reviews the subject comprehensively, but briefly in the first or so chapters? I've taken the course before, and I don't want to have to refer to a bigger text devoted to differential/riemannian geometry and I'd rather just read a brief review of the subject and the main/essential points. Thanks!","['soft-question', 'riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
1298950,Differences between real and complex analysis?,"To start with, real analysis deals with numbers along the (one dimensional) number line, while complex analysis deals with numbers along two dimensions, real and imaginary, Cartesian style. Could this be what causes some of the differences mentioned below? For instance real analysis deals with sequences of numbers, while complex analysis deals with series, which is the say, the sums of terms of sequences. Real analysis seems to be about limits and accumulation points and oriented toward differentiation, while complex analysis deals with with curve integrals and radii of convergence, and ""poles,"" lending itself more to integration. Is complex analysis to real analysis what polar coordinates are to linear coordinates, and does this help explain the differences in their orientations?","['complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
1298964,How to quantify the differencen between 2/4 and 20/40?,"Assume I have two methods to do prediction. The first method makes 4 predictions and 2 out of 4 are correct.

But I think the second method is better than the first one, because it makes more correct predictions. Is there a measure to quantify this? Any suggestion may help:) Thanks in advance.","['statistics', 'statistical-inference', 'machine-learning']"

1298993,Unifying Connection Between Topological Embeddings and Quotient Maps,"In a book on topology I'm reading the following theorem seemed striking to me, not for its proof, which I believe I understand, but because there's some nice symmetry going on that I'd perhaps like demystified: Theorem. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous map that is either open or closed. If $f$ is injective then it's a topological embedding. If $f$ is surjective then it's a quotient map.

1299162,Symmetry in Probability Around a Particular Phenomenon in Time?,"This has been hurting my brain substantially, recently. I'm not sure if I'm failing to make connections or if I see connections but am weary of their relevance. In my text the author claims that events occurring in the future are just as relevant as events before the said event. He writes that ""the results of later draws have precisely the same relevance as do the results of earlier ones! Even though performing the later draw does not physically affect the number Mk of red balls, information about the result of a later draw has the same effect on our state of knowledge about what could have been taken on the kth draw, as does information about an earlier one."" _Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, E.T. Jaynes Surely this doesn't refer to future events? I can see how knowing that I'll get a red ball in 4 draws would affect my knowledge of the next 3 draws, but where does something like this become prevalent in everyday use? Is it just a mathematical proof or does it actually hold some value in actual application? Also, correct me if I'm completely missing the point as I've allowed myself to get really confused and it may not even be that complicated.

totally disconnected must be discrete. Cantor's leaking tent is an example of a space which is totally disconnected but not locally connected at any point . Several spaces are locally connected but not totally disconnected.

1299443,Continuity of multivariable functions,"I have a question regarding norms on $\Bbb R^{n}$ and proving the continuity of multivariable functions.  Specifically, suppose we have $f: \Bbb R^{2} \to \Bbb R$, for example.  To prove $f$ is continuous at some $x \in \Bbb R^{2}$, we need to show for every $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $|| x - y || < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. My first question regarding the above is: Since all possible norms on $\Bbb R^{2}$ are equivalent, is it normal for us to use whichever norm on $\Bbb R^{2}$ that makes the proof above the easiest?  I have an example of a proof I came up with below to illustrate what I mean (and I would like it to be checked). Now, my second question is about the equivalence of metrics: Consider two metrics $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ on some space $X$, and consider the topologies of each metric.  If we have $d_{1}(x,y) \leq c d_{2}(x,y)$ for some constant $c > 0$, does this imply the topology of $d_{1}$ is strictly finer than the topology of $d_{2}$?  I can't seem to prove this.  I guess I would need to show for any open ball around $x \in X$ in the $d_{2}$ metric, we can find an open ball around $x$ in the $d_{1}$ metric contained in the first open ball.  I think this is deceptively easy, but I haven't been able to do it. Finally, my last question is regarding whether or not the below proof is correct: Prove $f(x,y) = xy$ is continuous at each $(x_{0},y_{0}) \in \Bbb R^{2}$. To prove this, I will choose to use the $|| \cdot || _{\infty}$ norm on $\Bbb R^{2}$.  Let $\epsilon > 0$.  Then $|xy - x_{0}y_{0}| = |xy - xy_{0} + xy_{0} - x_{0}y_{0}| \leq |x||y - y_{0}| + |y_{0}| |x - x_{0}| \leq (|x| + |y_{0}|)||(x,y) - (x_{0},y_{0})||_{\infty}$.

Now, I know the definition of the expected value is: $E[X] = \sum_{i}{x_i p_i}$ So, I proved the expected value of the Geometric Distribution like this: $E[X]=\sum _{ i=0 }^{ \infty  }{ iP(X=i) } = \sum _{i=0}^{\infty}{i q^i p} = p\sum _{i=0}^{\infty}{i q^i} = pq \sum _{i=0}^{\infty}{iq^{i-1}}$ $\qquad = pq \sum _{i=0}^{\infty}{\frac{d}{dq}q^i} = pq \frac{d}{dq}(\sum _{i=0}^{\infty}{q^i}) = pq \frac{d}{dq}(\frac{1}{1-q})$ $\qquad = pq \frac{1}{(1-q)^2} = \frac{pq}{p^2} = \frac{q}{p}$ So now, I would like to prove that $Var[X] = \frac{q}{p^2}$.

1299502,Diffeomorphism-invariant spaces of smooth functions,"Let's start with an interesting story. In his celebrated Partial Differential Relations (p. 146), the great Misha Gromov gives a nice exercise of which the following is a (strict) part. Exercise. Consider the action of $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb R^n)$  on the space $C^\infty(\mathbb R^n)$ of smooth functions $\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$. Then if $n\geq 2$, then there are exactly six (non-trivial) invariant subspaces; if $n = 1$, then there are ten of them. It's quite easy to find the invariant subspaces Gromov is thinking about (I will give no spoiler...). The problem is that, according to these two messages of C. McMullen, the exercise is actually false. McMullen's counterexample is the following: take a sequence space $S \subset \mathbb R^\mathbb N$ and define the function subspace
$$\mathscr E[S] = \left\{ f \in C^\infty(\mathbb R) \,\middle|\, \forall (x_n)_n \in \mathbb R^\mathbb N, |x_n| \xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{} \infty \Longrightarrow (f(x_n))_n \in S\right\}.$$
This is quite clearly a $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb R)$-invariant subspace of $C^\infty(\mathbb R)$. McMullen claims that the sequence space
$$\mathrm{bv} = \left\{(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\,\middle |\, \sum_{k} |a_{k+1} - a_k| < +\infty \right\}$$
already gives an example of an ""exotic"" invariant subspace $\mathscr E[\mathrm{bv}]$ (i.e. one different from Gromov's ten examples) and that it is easy to modify it to give uncountably many such invariant subspaces. I have two questions: Can you prove McMullen's claims? If $n\geq 2$, is there an invariant subspace which isn't of the form $\mathscr E[S]$? (if $n = 1$, the space $\mathscr E[S]$ doesn't make any difference between the two ends $\pm \infty$ of $\mathbb R$ so only six of Gromov's ten subspaces are of this form).","['invariant-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Let $q \in N$ be some point. Define $$k_q(\mathbf{x}):=[R_z(\theta(\mathbf{x})) \circ h \circ R_z(-\theta(\mathbf{x}))](\mathbf{x})$$ where $R_z$ is the rotation matrix around the $z$ -axis, and a branch of $\theta$ is chosen so that it is smooth around $q$ . Say $p$ is the (unique) point in $\mathbb{K}^3$ such that $q$ is the result of some rotation of it around the $z$ -axis. If $U_p$ is taken to be a sufficiently small ball around $p$ (so that it doesn't intersect the $z$ -axis), I claim that $k_q$ is a diffeomorphism with domain $\overline{U}_q:=R_z(\theta(q))[U_p]$ and codomain $\overline{V}_q:=k_q(\overline{U}_q)$ . I also claim that $$k_q(\overline{U}_q \cap N)=\overline{V}_q \cap (\mathbb{R}^2 \times \{0\}) .$$ Now, trying to generalize this to arbitrary $n$ seems difficult to me, as I have no idea how rotations in $\geq 4$ dimensions work. My questions are: Is the proof for $n=3$ valid? If not,  please help me correct it. How can one prove the general case?

I'm doing Year 12 Maths in Australia for what it's worth. In our textbooks the formula to find the derivative of a function is: If $y = ax^n$ then $\frac {\mathbb d y} {\mathbb d x} = anx^{n-1}$. I can see that this works algebraically, but.. An explanation/formula that I've found on the internet but not in my textbook is in the form: $\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)} h$. With the latter formula, which we're not taught, I can see visually on a graph and algebraically if I make the difference between two x value an ever smaller difference like 0.000...0001 then it gives a y difference value that very closely approximates the actual tangent at a given point. Hopefully I got that correct.

Nevertheless, I've had no luck so far getting a proof for $\sec$; I have a feeling the proofs of $sec$ and $tan$ are very closely related, as are the $\csc, \cot$ proofs.

1299839,Seven-Card Stud with Random Hand Selection,"I was recently confronted with a number—$2727707$, actually—that started a short train of thought while I was placed on hold.  (This seems to happen quite often: both the observation of unusual numbers, and also being placed on hold.)  Suppose you had a seven-card poker hand, consisting of all sevens, the deuces of spades and hearts, and the ten of diamonds. Obviously, if you were playing ordinary stud, your best hand is the sevens and the ten.  But suppose once all hands are dealt, the actual five-card combinations for the sake of comparison are selected randomly (with each combination having an equal probability).  It is a simple, if somewhat tedious, matter to determine what the odds are that the combination in this case would be four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair.  (The hand cannot be a straight or a flush, and must at least be two pair.) However, the general case is a bit more involved, in large part because the ranking of poker hands is somewhat irregular, involving a mix of sets of cards of the same rank, sets of cards of the same suit, rank sequences, and combinations of these.  With that in mind: Given two seven-card hands, is there any general method (that avoids brute force enumeration) for determining which one is likely to win a head-to-head matchup between randomly-selected five-card combinations? In the event that there is no such general method, is there a method by which it could be quickly determined, without brute force enumeration, that a hand dominates another (i.e., that any five-card combinations of one beats any five-card combination of the other)?","['probability', 'card-games']"

I'm aware this question has been asked already, but the explanations were a little shakey and referenced a google sample preview of a text of whose terminology I wasn't very familiar with, so I would like some more input if possible. Here's my attempt: Let $f(z)=z^2+\cos(z)$. Through the power series of the cosine function
$$
f(z)=z^2+1-\frac{z^2}{2!}+\frac{z^4}{4!}-\cdots=1+\frac{z^2}{2!}+\frac{z^4}{4!}-\cdots,

$$
g(z):=\frac{f(z)-1}{z}

$: if there exists some $z_0$ such that $g(z)\neq z_0$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$, then $-z_0$ is also missed by oddness of $g$, which is a contradiction (since $g(0)=0$ we rule the possibility that $z_0=0$). (I'm not sure about the following step) It follows that $zg(z)$ and so $zg(z)+1=f(z)$ is surjective. Is this method valid? Would I need further justification to show that $z\mapsto z$ and $z\mapsto g(z)$ surjective imply its product -- $z\mapsto zg(z)$ -- is also surjective (if this is even true). Any input is greatly appreciated. Edit: After thinking about this for a moment longer, I realize this logic would also show that the range of any entire even function is all of $\mathbb{C}$, which seems like quite a strong conclusion.

For each $z = (z^1, z^2) \in \mathbb{S}^3$ define a curve $\gamma_z: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^3$ by $$ \gamma_z(t) = (e^{it}z^1, e^{it}z^2).$$ He subsequently asks for us to compute the coordinate representation of $\gamma_z(t)$ using stereographic projection and then also compute $\gamma_z'(t)$ under the same coordinate transformation.  I'm really confused about to do this using complex variables when we're working in a real manifold.  Out of stubbornness I computed what I thought would be the real representation of $\gamma_z(t)$: $$
\gamma_x(t) \;\; =\;\; (x^1 \cos t - x^2 \sin t, x^1 \sin t + x^2 \cos t, x^3 \cos t - x^4 \sin t, x^3 \sin t + x^4 \cos t)
$$ but this can't possibly be right.  Letting $\sigma:\mathbb{S}^3/\{N\} \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be the stereographic projection from the neighborhood omitting the point $N = (0,0,0,1)$, we then obtain $$
(\sigma\circ \gamma_x)(t) \;\; =\;\; \frac{(x^1 \cos t - x^2 \sin t, x^1 \sin t + x^2 \cos t, x^3 \cos t - x^4 \sin t)}{1 - x^3\sin t - x^4 \cos t}

1300715,Groups with finite automorphism groups.,"An easy argument shows that for any finite group $G$ the cardinal of $Aut(G)$ is less than $(|G|-1)!$. In particular the automorphisms group of a finite group is finite. Basically my question is about the converse statement. If a group $G$ has finite automorphisms group then should $G$ be finite ? The answer to this question is no, the example of $\mathbb{Z}$ with $Aut(\mathbb{Z})$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is a counter-example. Hence, using this, it is an easy exercise to show that for any finite group $F$ we must have $Aut(\mathbb{Z}\times F)$ finite of cardinal less than $2\times |F|\times Aut(F)$ (basically, $F$ is a characteristic subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}\times F$ hence $(1,1_F)$ must be sent to $(\pm 1,f)$ where $f\in F$) leading to a family of counter-examples. Now take a group $G$ with finite automorphisms group then $G/Z(G)$ is finite. Hence any such $G$ can be written as a central extension : $$\text{ (E) : }1\rightarrow A\rightarrow G\rightarrow F\rightarrow 1 $$ Where $A$ is abelian and $F$ finite. Now come the real questions (remarks, critics, partial answers and references are welcome) : Can we have a characterization of groups $G$ with $G$ infinite abelian and $Aut(G)$ finite ? I believe that such groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}\times F$ where $F$ is a finite abelian group. It is certainly true when we assume $G$ to be finitely generated and as for non-finitely generated groups, I know for a fact that $\mathbb{Q}$ will have $\mathbb{Q}^*$ as automorphism group. Although I am not totally sure of the argument $\mathbb{Z}(p^{\infty})$ (the set of roots of unity of order $p^k$ for some $k$) also has infinite automorphisms group. As for ""general"" non-finitely generated abelian groups I have no clue. Can every group $G$, infinite group with finite automorphisms group, be written as a central extension $(E)$ with $F$ finite, $A$ abelian with finite automorphisms group? Clearly if 1 admits a precise answer and 2 a positive answer then we have a good way to reduce the problem. The last question is the converse. Assume that a group $G$ is written as a central extension $(E)$ where $F$ is finite and $A$ infinite abelian group with finite automorphisms group then does it follow that $G$ is infinite with finite automorphisms group? Please note that the extension needs to be central, in particular $G:=\mathbb{Z}\rtimes_{-1}\{\pm 1\}$ (the fundamental group of the Klein bottle) is not a counter example to 3.","['group-theory', 'infinite-groups']"

Any 3 subgroups have a common member. Prove that there is a person who is a member of all the subgroups. proof by contradiction seems like a good fit here, but I can't seem to get the details right.",['combinatorics']
