I know $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if they represent: X$\rightarrow$Y, and there exists Homotopy map: $H: X \times [0,1] \rightarrow Y$, with: $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and $H(x,1)=g(x)$ So $X$ is a torus with 2-disc removed, $Y$ is the Klein bottle with 2-disc removed, but I am not sure how to apply the equation in practice.

   $|z|$ denotes the absolute value of $z$). My effort Imagining a number line and interpreting the problem as the request to have the sum of the distances of $5x,6y$ from $0$ to be less or equal to $30$ ,we have that  : i) for $|5x| \le 30-h $, where $0 \le h \le 15 $, then $ |6y| \le h$ (and also the other way around : $ |6y| \le 30-h $ and $|5x| \le h$). Therefore $15\le 5x \le 30 $ and $-30 \ge 5x \ge -15 $ which implies $x \in [-6,-3]\cap [3,6] $ and so we also we find $y \in [-15/6,15/6] $. Inverting the cases we find $x \in [3,-3]$ and $y\in [-5,-15/6]\cap [15/6,5]$. By plotting several points for $ 0 \le x \le 6 $ and using the fact that we have symmetry about the origin $(0,0)$ we find that the requested area is a square with side $\sqrt{61}$ (since one side will have coordinates $(-6,0)$ and $(0,-5)$) Question Is my effort correct ?How could I have simplified it (I think I have
  made the problem harder than it needed to be in some part) ? Are there

1648189,Understanding a proof of RREF uniqueness,"Base Case $(n = 1)$: Suppose $A$ has only one column. If $A$ is the all zero matrix, it is row equivalent only to itself and is in reduced row echelon form. Every nonzero matrix with one column has a nonzero entry, and all such matrices have reduced row echelon form the column vector $(1, 0,\ldots, 0)$ and no other row echelon form. Induction Step: Suppose now that $n > 1$, that the result holds for all $m \times n$ matrices and let $A \in M_{m,n+1}$. For any $M \in M_{m,n+1}$, we let $M' \in M_{m, n}$ be obtained by removing the last column of $M$. Let $B, C$ be rref of $A$. Then $B', C'$ are in rref and row-equivalent to $A'$. By induction $B' = C'.$ In other words $B, C$ are equal except possibly in the last column. Suppose $B \neq C: \exists i (1 \le i \le m)$ s.t. $b_{i,n+1} \neq c_{i,n+1}$. Let $x = (x_1,\ldots, x_{n + 1})$ be a vector with $Bx = 0$. Then $Cx = 0$ implying $(B - C)x = 0.$ Since $B - C$ is zero except in its last column, performing the multiplication of the $i$th row of $B - C$ by $x$ is $(b_{i, n+1} - c_{i, n+ 1})x_{n + 1} = 0$. Since $b_{i, n+1} \neq c_{i, n+ 1}$, we have that $x_{n + 1} = 0.$ Thus $x_{n + 1}$ is not a free variable for either $B$ or $C$, so in each of these matrices the last column must contain a leading entry of $1$ and have all the other entries $0$ . In both $B, C$ the $1$ must lie in the first zero row of $B'$ and $C'.$ Thus $B = C.$ I am having difficulty with the part in bold. Suppose the last column is all $0$'s. Then $x_{n + 1}$ can be anything $\neq 0$ which is not allowed. Is that why the last columns of $B,C$ must contain a leading entry of $1$ and have all the other entries $0$? What about rref matrices whose last columns are made up of constants that are neither $0$, nor $1$ like the one below? $

1648200,General question of derivatives and their inversions,"If $\frac{df(x,y)}{dx} = a$, does $\frac{1}{a} = \frac{dx}{df(x,y)}$? Consider $f(x,y) = x^2y \Rightarrow \frac{df(x,y)}{dx} = 2xy \equiv a$, than $\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{2xy}$. Now calculate $\frac{dx}{df(x,y)} = \frac{dx}{d(x^2y)}$ via substitution $x^2y = u \Rightarrow x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{u}{y}} \Rightarrow \frac{dx}{d(x^2y)} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{u}{y}}}{du} = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{u}{y})^{-\frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2}y} = \frac{1}{2xy}$ So it seems my claim is true, but it still feels strange to me. Could I be just lucky with my example? Some info about my background. I'm a physics major and started pondering about thermodynamics, where the definition of absolute temperature is given as $\frac{1}{T} = \frac{dS(E,\lambda)}{dE}$, with temperature $T$, entropy $S$, energy $E$ and some other (fixed) system variable $\lambda$. Reason for my confusion is that I can't make much (physical) sense out of $\frac{dE}{dS(E,\lambda)}$, which with my claim would equal to $T$.",['derivatives']
1648203,How to do calculus with split-complex (hyperbolic) numbers?,"TL;DR: how do I define a ""split-holomorphic"" function? As far as I've heard, there is a notion of split-complex numbers: $z = x+uy$ , with $u\not\in \Bbb R $ and $u^2 = 1$ . One defines the conjugate as $\overline{z} = x - uy$ and the modulus as $|z| = \sqrt{|z\overline{z}|}$ , where the absolute value inside the root is the one for real numbers, as usual.
Apparently this can be used to study the pseudo-Riemannian geometry of $\Bbb L^2 = \Bbb R^2_1$ in the same way thay $\Bbb C$ is identified with $\Bbb R^2$ . But these split-complex numbers form a ring only, and not a field: elements in the diagonals don't have multiplicative inverses. Incidentally, these diagonals correspond to lightlike directions in $\Bbb L^2$ (and such directions cause every sort of problems). I don't know if there is a standard notation for this set of split-complex numbers, but given a function of said set to itself, how do I define things like ""being holomorphic""? I can't make sense of the limit $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}$$ since $h$ could approach zero from lightlike directions. Do I just ignore these directions? Most likely I'm overthinking this. We could define continuity of $f$ by continuity of its components, and work formally with the above limit to obtain a revised version of the CR equations, and say that $f$ is split-holomorphic if the revised CR equations hold and if the partial derivatives of the components are continuous (copying the Looman-Menchoff theorem), but I am speculating too much and I am unsure about these things. What is the correct way to do calculus with split-complex numbers, if this is possible? More references are also welcome. P.s.: there is a nice book called ""Geometry of Minkowski Space-Time"", by Zampetti, et al, but they do a more algebraic approach and do not talk about the things I'm asking.","['complex-analysis', 'semi-riemannian-geometry', 'split-complex-numbers']"

However, I have a problem with this. Suppose you have a Poisson random variable $X$ with $E(X) = a$. Then a sum of $n$ Poisson random variables gives a mean of $E(nX) = n(a).$ However the variance will be $\text{Var}(nX) = n^2(a)$ Here lies the problem. If $nX$ has a Poisson distribution then the mean and the variance has to be the same; this is a property of Poisson distribution. But since they are different, the distribution can't be Poisson.

Now I would like to empathize the importance of the spaces which are homotopy equivalent to finite CW complexes, i.e, I try to show that there are a lot of spaces we care about that satisfy this property. Therefore i shoot my questions: 1) Are any sufficient conditions on Topological Manifolds to be homotopy equivalent to finite CW complexes. 2) Are any sufficient conditions on Smooth Manifolds to be homotopy equivalent to finite CW complexes. 3) Do you know sufficient conditions on other spaces to be homotopy equivalent to finite CW complexes. Note that I only care about finite CW complexes. Please I need references to papers or books since I will cite them. I won't prove any of the results since I will use this information only as an informal motivation to show that the results presented in that section of the essay are amazing and broadly useful. Background: I'm an undergraduate, hence don't be very concise in your explanations and don't skip to many details please.

And I also have seen the Corollary A.12 in Hatcher: A compact manifold is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. But it doesn't say that the CW complex is finite so that doesn't work for me.

1648275,Proving a norm is lipschitz,"Let $M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. Define the function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=\Vert Mx\Vert$. Show that $f$ is Lipschitz. Let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n$, then we want to find a $L>0$ such that $$\Vert f(x)-f(y)\Vert \le L\Vert x-y\Vert$$ We have \begin{align}
\Vert f(x)-f(y)\Vert &= \big\Vert \Vert Mx\Vert-\Vert My\Vert\big\Vert\\
&\le \Vert Mx- My\Vert&\text{reverse triangle ineq.}\\
&\le \Vert M\Vert\Vert x-y\Vert\\

I notice that we take $L=\Vert M\Vert$ but could we take anything greater than our chosen $L$, in other words, is the Lipschitz constant unique? On a side note, is $\Vert \Vert Mx\Vert \Vert=\Vert Mx\Vert$? In general can we say that $\Vert\Vert a\Vert\Vert = \Vert a\Vert$?","['continuity', 'normed-spaces', 'lipschitz-functions', 'linear-algebra']"

1648376,concentration of volume of hypersphere,"I am reading about features of volume of hyperballs, where I see two theorems, Most of the volume of the d-dimensional ball of radius r is contained in an

the plane $x_1 = c/(d-1)^{1/2}$ Namely, most of volume of hyperball is near the surface, and, most of volume of hyperball is near the equator. How can these two happen at the same time? I find it very hard to have an image that can boil these two together. Can someone explain why this isn't a contradiction? Currently my guess is you don't know what ""north pole"" you have for reference when you pick the equator, so the two theorems can be resolved in the way that most of volume is only in the proportion of annulus near the surface which overlaps the equator currently considered (by picking a point as north pole).

1648542,Proving Holder's inequality for Schatten norms,"Sticking to the finite dimensional case, Holder's inequality for Schatten norms is given by $$\left\|AB\right\|_{S^1}\leq\left\|A\right\|_{S^p}\left\|B\right\|_{S^q}$$ for $A,B$ $n\times n$ matrices, $p,q\in[1,\infty]$, and $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$. So using Young's inequality, the expression I have in mind is the following

$$\sum_{i=1}^n|\sigma_i(AB)|\overset{?}{\leq}\sum_{i=1}^n|\sigma_i(A)||\sigma_{\pi(i)}(B)|$$

Of course maybe this isn't true, but it's the hurdle I ran into when trying to adapt the standard proof of Holder's inequality to the Schatten case. Also I don't strictly need all the absolute values since singular values are always non-negative, but originally I was considering only Hermitian matrices, so I decided to include them. Edit: After doing some numerical tests it looks like permuting the indices isn't necessary.  Thus to win the bounty I'm either looking for a proof that
$$\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i(AB)\leq\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i(A)\sigma_i(B)$$

I tried doing this problem with induction, but I have problem with induction so I was wondering if my solution was correct: The base case: For $n=0$, our formula gives us $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^0] =1$. This is true, because if we throw the die zero times, we always get zero sixes. Suppose it's true for $n=k$. Then the odds of an even number of sixes is $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$, and thus the odds of an odd number of sixes is $1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$. For $n=k+1$, there are two ways the number of sixes are even: a. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was even, and we do not throw a six for $n=k+1$: $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$ b. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was odd, and we throw a six for $n=k+1$: $\frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$ So the probability $p$ for an even number of sixes at $n=k+1$ is $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$ I have two questions How do I get from $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$ to $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$? I seem to have done something wrong, I can't get the algebra correct, I get $p = \frac{1}{3}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \dfrac{1}{6}$ Other than that, is my use of induction correct? Is it rigorous enough to prove the formula?","['induction', 'probability']"

1648764,How to put my knowledge of probability and statistics to practice,"Background: I am a masters student in stochastic analysis. My course is very theoretical, which in general is fine by me, it is what I enjoy the most. From the more data-friendly subjects, I have (or will obtain/deepen) knowledge in stochastic processes of all kinds, time series, statistics, linear regression. Apart from those my course focuses on stochastic analysis, stochastic differential equations, spatial modelling and point processes. I can work with R, Mathematica and a bit of Python and Javascript. And of course, one shouldn't forget: Excel. Motivation: The final impetus that lead me to write this question is quite simple: recently I stumbled upon a data-analysis student competition in my city and thought about entering. I quickly realized I have literally zero idea what to do with data. Not that I am not good at it - I literally have no actual knowledge, apart from being able to answer narrow questions in statistics and regression from classes, possibly model the simples processes if I try very hard. But more generally, I simply feel that since I am a mathematician, having data analysis skills is the sort of low-hanging fruit and it would be a great shame not to learn anything about it. Goals: Here lies the problem. While I have a vague idea, my lack of knowledge is such that I do not know what is it I want. I understand this does not make for a well-posed question, but I am hoping shaping my goals is what Math.SE will help with, too. I think I'd like to stick with R, since it's a free software that I'll always be able to use (unlike Mathematica), but software choice is secondary. Vaguely, I'd like to: 1) Have the knowledge necessary to be able to theoretically compete in such a competition (doing badly is fine, but currently I am wondering about entering a marathon having only read about ""legs"" and ""running"" on wikipedia) 2) Be able to most utilise my knowledge of mathematics and make it my strength - if I competed against other people I'd probably be stomped into ground by even those who have just basic statistics and time series knowledge, but are good at working with data. Moreover, if I could somehow incorporate actual stochastics/spatial modelling, that would also be an interesting option. 3) I'll take a stab at guessing my goals - be able to do basic statistics/regression in R, model different processes, do experiments with random variables from different probability distributions, have the basic toolset for time series. Beyond that I'd really be completely guessing. Questions : 1) What do I study? Are there topics/books considered to be the basics ? 2) How can I best utilize my strengths - i.e. deeper understanding of mathematics? Say if I somehow had to compare data using an interesting metric that requires good deal of knowledge of metric spaces to be understood (yeah, I don't know what I am talking about). Then again, it's very likely that the simpler, the better. I'd simple like to be aware of possible strengths, but I really do want to be able to walk/crawl properly first. 3) The main question: what resources would you recommend for me, i.e. someone who isn't afraid of (or even welcomes) complicated mathematics? That is not to say a simple book may not be far more important, but I am not limited to them. This is primarily a reference-request question (also to make it easier to answer, I suppose), but any answer consisting of general tips and thoughts on this matter will be very welcomed, too. Btw, I wouldn't want to make it sound like a competition is the main motivation for me, as it really isn't. It's just that I think it's a useful benchmark for the ""real-life"" data skills I learned.

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question I have been struggling with general topology and now, algebraic topology is simply murder. Some people seem to get on alright, but I am not one of them unfortunately. Please, the answer I need is ideally something very elaborate and extensive, possibly with easy-to-understand examples. Rewriting the definitions with concrete mathematical language and symbols won't help(those are readily accessible in my lecture notes). I want an explanation of what is happening and which part of the solid definitions are telling me so. One thing I would like to make clear is, I know the definitions, but I don't understand them; I can re-iterate them upon request, consult my lecture notes. Issue is I am writing down something I don't know what it means . It's like writing ancient Greek. I can remember the shapes of each character, their order and write some sentence down. But that's it. Can I explain it to someone with my own words ? Break it down? Absolutely not. That is why I am here to ask someone who fully understands these ideas to do exactly that for me: break it down. Go in slow motion. Show me the moves and codes behind it. Here's the definition I have for homotopy A homotopy between maps $f,g:X \rightarrow Y$ is a map $h: X \times I \rightarrow Y$ such that $$h(x,0)=f(x), h(x,1)=g(x) \in Y$$ where $x \in X$ and $I=[0,1]$ . We say maps $f,g$ are homotopic. It adds that, A homotopy deforms the map $f$ continuously to $g$ . So, I am given two sets $X,Y$ whatever they are and two maps $f,g$ that takes an element of $X$ to an element of $Y$ . I don't know if $f,g$ are bijective, only injective or surjective or whatever. No information on that. Just maps. And this ""homotopy"" is a ... ""map between maps""?
And even if so, what exactly is it doing? All the explanation seems to be done with this single line $$h(x,0)=f(x), h(x,1)=g(x) \in Y$$ but no, I don't get what's happening. So $X$ has a bunch of elements $x$ , and the product space $X \times I$ gives me elements of the form $\{x,t\} \in X \times I$ . Okay. But this map $h$ qualifies as a homotopy as long as the above holds? Then why not just always define $h$ as $h(x,t)=f(x)$ for any $t \neq 1$ and $h(x,t)=g(x)$ for $t=1$ , just as how we might define a piecewise function? Then I can define this ""homotopy"" on any maps. Sure, it adds ""deforms $f$ CONTINUOUSLY to $g$ "" but how is that stated in the definition itself? I see it nowhere. Here is an example in my notes which didn't help me understand the definition, Take $X=\{x\}$ the space with a single element $x$ . Then a map $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is the same as and element $f(x) \in Y$ . A homotopy $h: f \simeq g: X \rightarrow Y $ is the same as a path $h: I \rightarrow Y$ with initial point $h(0)=f(x)$ and terminal point $h(1)=g(x) \in Y$ . A homotopy $h: f \simeq f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the same as a closed path $h: I \rightarrow Y$ . Well, first off what is a ""path""? Intuition also doesn't make sense because when mapping one element to another, how can there be different ""paths""? $x$ goes to $y$ . Done. It's not like going from England to Singapore via either Amsterdam or Frankfurt (thus different paths) is it? Unless it's a map $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and telling me that $x \in X$ goes to $z_1 \in Z$ then to $y \in Y$ or $z_2 \in Z$ and then to $y \in Y$ , that might be different paths from $x$ to $y$ . But here, it is talking about $X$ and $Y$ only. And why is this ignoring $x$ ? It says $h: I \rightarrow Y$ ? The problem I also have is, this is labelled ""example"" but it's not specific at all. "" $h(0)=f(x)$ and $h(1)=g(x)$ "" over. So? What is this $h$ and how has it been defined? As a map, as a function of some sort? Maybe there are multiple homotopy thinkable, but then what are one or two of them? It's like saying $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=4$ . Done. Well, to a newbie, maybe secondary school kids, it might be nice to give them an example be it linear $f(x)=ax+b$ or $f(x)=x^2$ . To the eyes of the experienced, it might make perfect sense, a specific homotopy might pop out in their minds like popcorns but not in mine. It's an utter nightmare. I know this is ""abstract"" math but can not some more specific-ness be put into it? Pictures and diagrams perhaps? This is only the tip of the massive massive confusion and dumb-foundedness I am experiencing in this area of study. Maybe once it ""clicks"" it all goes down like an avalanche but so far it's nothing but counter-intuitive. Can someone please make this possible for me to digest?

Following this approach the total number of possible solutions would be $${34+3 \choose 3} $$ But I'm not sure if its the right solution. The second approach is to sum all of the possible values that $x_1$ and $x_2$ could possibly take, also $x_1=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ and $x_2=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$

and sum them together like this:

My answer so far: $p = a^2+2b^2 = (a+b\sqrt{-2})(a-b\sqrt{-2})$ where $p\geq3$ is a rational prime. $a±b\sqrt{-2}$ are irreducible since their norm $(a^2+2b^2=p)$ is a prime and I know every prime is irreducible.

Now fold the paper along that line. Q: What is the function for the area covered by the folded piece of paper $A_f(\theta)$, where $\theta$ denotes the orientation of $l$? This is not a textbook problem, so I don't know how difficult it will be to come up with a solution, but here are my thoughts so far: The function must have minima when all points of the folded part of the paper are projected on top of all points of the unfolded part, i.e. when $A_f(\theta=0,\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3}{4}\pi,...)=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the symmetry, we can restrict our investigation to $\theta \in[0,\frac{\pi}{4}]$. Here is my strategy: $1.$ Find the two sets of points, $S_l$ and $S_r$ (""left"" and ""right"" of $l$, respectively), that $l$ divides the square $S$ into, as a function of $\theta$. $2.$ Reflect $S_l$ around $l$, $S_l \mapsto S_l^*$. $3.$ Find the area of points that make up the union $S_l^* \cup S_r$. $1)$ $l=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x\\y\end{smallmatrix}\right)=t\left( \begin{smallmatrix}1\\ \tan\theta\end{smallmatrix}\right)$
 so $S_l=\{x,y : |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \wedge y> x\tan\theta \}$ and 
$S_r=S \setminus S_l$. $2)$ I have found the following formula for reflection, $\mathrm{Ref}_l(v) = 2\frac{v\cdot l}{|l|^2}l - v,$ where $v$ is being reflected around $l$. Ideally I would like to replace $v$ with $S_l$, but I've never tried to handle sets this way and don't really know how to proceed from here. $3)$ Again, I'm not familiar with how this is done (or indeed if it can be done!). It seems to me that there's a long way from the abstract sets to the geometrical figures. It is very possible that this can be done in a much simpler way; either way, I'd appreciate both alternative methods of solution as well as insights into how my strategy could be executed properly !

$$\sigma_-\colon S^n-N\to\mathbb{R}^n$$
Both of these maps are homeomorphisms and they form an atlas for the standard smooth structure on $S^n$.  I'm interested in how they should induce the standard orientation on $S^n$.  (Here I orient $S^n$ by putting the standard orientation on $T S^n \oplus \nu\cong T\mathbb{R}^{n+1}|_{S^n}$ and orient $\nu$ by declaring that the outward-pointing direction is positive.)

Geometrically, it seems like $D_v (\sigma_+^{-1}\circ \sigma_-) (b_i)=-b_1$ if $i= 1$ and $b_i$ otherwise, suggesting that the transition function is orientation reversing, and hence exactly one of $\sigma_+$ and $\sigma_-$ is orientation reversing.  My question is which one reverses orientation and which preserves? I haven't succeeded in computing anything in terms of the formulas for stereographic projection.

1649303,Eigenvalue equation and separable solutions,"Recently, studying Quantum Mechanics I found a doubt regarding separable solutions and eigenvalue equations for differential operators. Suppose we are considering some space $\mathcal{H}$ of functions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with values in $\mathbb{C}$, like $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$. Now consider a certain differential operator $A$ in $\mathcal{H}$ and the eigenvalue equation for $A$: $$A\psi = \lambda \psi.$$ This is a partial differential equation, if $A$ is a differential operator. Now, suppose for simplicity we already know the spectrum of $A$ and we want to solve it to find the eigenvectors. Since it is a PDE the first strategy would be separation of variables. In that case we consider, using for example cartesian coordinates that $\psi(x,y,z)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. If everything works, what we will achieve is that we will find that if $\psi$ is separable, then it is a solution with $X$,$Y$ and $Z$ given by something we found . This, however, doesn't say the converse: that if $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of $A$, it is necessarily of the form $\psi(x,y,z)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$ . Indeed, if $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are separable solutions their sum, which is not a separable solution in general, also satisfies $A(\psi_1+\psi_2)=\lambda(\psi_1+\psi_2)$. My question is: if $\psi$ is an eigenfunction of a differential operator $A$ for a known eigenvalue $\lambda$, is $\psi$ necessarily separable? My whole point is: when we pick the eigenvalue equation and use separation of variables we show that ""being separable implies being an eigenfunction"", but the converse doesn't seem to be imediate.

Consider the projective space $P^1(\mathbb{C})$. It is well known that the line bundles $E$ over a topological space $X$ are classified up to isomorphsim by their Chern classes $c_1(E) \in H^2(X;\mathbb{Z})$. In the case of $P^1(\mathbb{C}) \cong S^2$ then $H^2(P^1(\mathbb{C});\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}$.

These two statements are clearly the same in some way, which I would like to show. In this case $c_1(E)$ is the top chern class and so is the Euler class of the vector bundle. Define the euler class via the Thom isomophism as folows: there exists an element of the relative cohomology group $u \in H^2(E, E \setminus E_0; \mathbf{Z})$ so the the restriction of $U$ to each fiber of $E$ is the orientation class on $F$. The Euler class is the image of this form Under the canonical maps $H^r(E, E \setminus E_0; \mathbf{Z}) \to H^r(E; \mathbf{Z}) \to H^r(X; \mathbf{Z})$. Now $P^1(\mathbb{C})$ can be covered by two open sets, both homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, and the vector bundle over these will be the trivial bundle so given coordinites $(z, w)$ on $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C}-0$ the thom class on these is going to (I guess) like $\frac{1}{w} dw \wedge d \bar{w}$. I now try to glue these two back together to get a thom class over the whole bundle. Glue the two copies together by $(z , w) = (z^{-1} , \frac{z^n}{\|z\|^n}w)$. This corressponds to the vector bundle with hopotopy class $n \in \mathbb{Z} \cong \pi_1 (U(1))$. Now we want to see which thom class this gluing procedure produces. At this stage I've kind of lost the wood for the trees but I went ahead and did a lot of transforming into new coordinites and wedging and pulling back anyway. The results were confusing at best, but I got something of the form $n z^{-1} dz \wedge  d \bar{z} $ as the class $c_1(E) \in H^2(P^1(\mathbb{C});\mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the vector bundle with clutching function  $(z , w) = (z^{-1} , \frac{z^n}{\|z\|^n}w)$. I was intially quite excited that everything had come together so well but I think I must have made a mistake doing hopeful cancellations or just blatently making up what I was doing based on the answer I hoped to get or something. I think the class $n=2$ should corresspond to the case of the tangent sphere and here we expect the Euler class to be twice the generating class of $H^2(P^1(\mathbb{C});\mathbb{Z})$ and it looks like this is the case. Likewise $n=0$ seems to give the trivial case. On the other hand I though $n=1$ respresented the tautogical bundle? In which case I should get $-1$ times the generating class of $H^2(P^1(\mathbb{C});\mathbb{Z})$, but I don't get that. I would like to head back and try and get everything more exactly, but Id like to know my search isnt fruitless and I'm a little out of my depth.

If person #1 is is room A, then you write A in the first position, if a person # 2 is in room C, then you write C in the second position and so on.

1649476,Properties of the Discrete Logarithm Problem,"I am self-studying Hoffstein's An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography , and this is problem 2.3 (p. 107-08). Let $p$ be a prime and $g$ an element in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ with order $r$. (a) Suppose that $x=a$ and $x=b$ are both integer solutions to the equation $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$. Prove that $a\equiv b \pmod{p-1}$. (b) Prove that $\log_g(h_1h_2)\equiv \log_g(h_1)+\log_g(h_2) \pmod{r}$ for all $h_1,h_2 \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ such that $g^x \equiv h_1 \pmod{p}$ and $g^x \equiv h_2 \pmod{p}$ have integer solutions. (c) Prove that $\log_g (h^n) \equiv n \log_g(h) \pmod{r}$ for all $h \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ such that $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$ has an integer solution and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. My attempt: Feedback highly appreciated (a) The way to think of a primitive root is that $g$ is a generator in $\pmod{p}$ if and only if the function $f(x) \equiv g^x  \pmod{p}$ is a bijection over the domain $\mathbb{F}_p^*=\{1,2,\dots, p-1\}$. Thus our question comes down to prove: $$g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$ which is exceedingly convenient as it is covered by Fermat's Little Theorem . Now, since $g$ is a primitive root it follows that if $a \not b$ and $a \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ then $b=a+(p-1)k$ (for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$). We have $g^{b}\equiv g^{a+(p-1)k} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}\left(g^{p-1} \right)^k \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}$.  which is the same as $a \equiv b \pmod{p-1} $. (b) For the next problem 
We have that $g^{\log_g (h_1)+\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{\log_g (h_1)}g^{\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv h_1\cdot h_2$ (c) We use the technique of mathematical induction. It is eminently clear that this is true for the base case $k=1$. Let us thus assume that the result holds for all $k$ up to $k=n-1$. We now show that this implies that it also holds for $k=n$. We have that:
\begin{align*}
g^{\log_g (h^{n})} &=g^{\log_g (h^{(n-1)+1})}  \\
&=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1}h)} \\
&=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1})}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{$\log_g(h_1h_2)\equiv \log_g(h_1)+\log_g(h_2)$} \\
&=g^{(n-1)\log_g(h)}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{Induction Assumption} \\
&=g^{n\log_g(h)} \tag{Addition Property of Exponential}
\end{align*}
which means that it holds for the induction step as well. This completes the proof.","['proof-verification', 'number-theory', 'congruences', 'elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1649511,Simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$ and its generator,"I'm still trying to figure out definitions and properties of random walks on $\mathbb Z^d$. My goal is to work up to understanding some large deviation principles for the local times of such random walks, but I'm having quite some trouble with the basics. Let $(X_t)_{t\geq0}$ be a simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$ in continuous time. So the process starts in some point $x \in \mathbb Z^d$ at time $0$ and after a waiting time (exponentially distributed with parameter $1$) it jumps to each of its $2d$ neighbours with equal probability. $\mathbb P_x$ and $\mathbb E_x$ denote probability and expectation assuming the random walk starts in $X_0=x\in \mathbb Z^d$ at time $t=0$. Next, the generator of a random walk is introduced as an operator on the space $\mathbb R^{\mathbb Z^d}$ of functions from $\mathbb Z^d$ to $\mathbb R$: $$\Delta f(x) = \sum_{y:\ |x-y|=1} \left[f(y)-f(x)\right]$$
for $x \in \mathbb Z^d$ and $f \in \mathbb R^{\mathbb Z^d}$. Not to mention that I don't understand meaning and significance of this operator, my main problem right now is that I don't understand why this equality holds: $$\Delta f(x) = \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right|_{t=0} \mathbb E_x \left[f(X_t) \right]$$

The exercise states that if 1) $f^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow f_* \mathcal{O}_Y$ is a surjective morphism of sheaves and 2) $f$ is a homeomorphism onto a closed set of $X$, then $\phi$ must be surjective. Question: I have written a proof which seems correct but does not use hypothesis 2). So i wonder whether hypothesis 2) is truly necessary. My Proof: Take $b \in B = f_*\mathcal{O}_Y(X)$. Since $f^{\#}$ is surjective, by exercise II.1.3(a) there exists an open covering
$X = \bigcup_i U_i$ and sections $t_i \in \mathcal{O}_{X} (U_i)$ such that $b|_{U_i} = f^{\#}_{U_i}(t_i)$. Since we can cover each $U_i$ be principal opens $D(a_{ij})$, and since $X$ is quasi-compact, we have 
$X = \bigcup_{i \in I} D(a_i)$, where $I$ is finite, and sections $t_i \in \mathcal{O}_X(D(a_i))$ such that $b|_{D(a_i)} = f^{\#}_{D(a_i)}(t_i)$. Since $ \mathcal{O}_X(D(a_i)) = A_{a_i}$, we have that each $t_i$ is an element of $A_{a_i}$, say $t_i = u_i / a_i^{n_i}$.
Since $f_* \mathcal{O}_Y(D(a_i)) = B_{\phi(a_i)}$, and $f^{\#}_{D(a_i)}:A_{a_i} \rightarrow B_{\phi(a_i)}$ is the localization of $\phi$, the equality $b|_{D(a_i)} = f^{\#}_{D(a_i)}(t_i)$ is equivalent to the equality $b/1 = \phi(u_i) / \phi(a_i^{n_i})$ in the ring $B_{\phi(a_i)}$ or equivalently $\phi(a_i^{\ell_i}) b = \phi(a_i^{\nu_i}) \phi(u_i)$ in the ring $B$, for some $\ell_i,\nu_i$. Since the $a_i$ generate $A$, so will the $a_i^{\ell_i}$ and so there exist $c_i \in A$ such that $\sum_i  c_i a_i^{\ell_i} = 1$. But this implies that
$b = \sum_i \phi(c_i)\phi(a_i^{\nu_i}) \phi(u_i)$ and we are done.","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'proof-verification']"

Maybe I'm missing some clever change of variables or nice contour for residue calculation. This integral arises when performing the Fourier transform of a superellipsoid . EDIT I decided to add a short connotation to this question. The original problem comes from physics and requires making a Fourier transform of a superellipsoid. I parametrized superellipsoid in the following manner: $$x=a*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\cos^\epsilon\phi,$$ $$y=b*r*\cos^\eta\theta*\sin^\epsilon\phi,$$
$$z=c*r*\sin^\eta\theta$$ Here $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta$ and $\cos^{\eta}\theta$ are signed functions i.e. $\sin^{\epsilon}\theta = sign(\sin\theta)*|\sin^{\epsilon}\theta|$. The absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian is $abc\epsilon\eta r^2\cos^{2\epsilon-1}\theta\sin^{\epsilon -1}\theta\cos^{\eta-1}\phi\sin^{\eta-1}\phi$. Next, when performing Fourier transform direct vector k along z axis. Then we have in the region $\theta[0,\pi/2]$, $\phi[0,\pi/2]$:
$$abc\epsilon\eta\int_{r=0}^1 \int_{\theta=0}^{\theta = \pi/2}\int_{\phi=0}^{\pi/2}e^{-ikr\sin^{\epsilon}}r^2\cos^{2\epsilon-1}\theta\sin^{\epsilon-1}\theta\cos^{\eta-1}\phi\sin^{\eta-1}\phi dr d\theta d\phi$$ Integration with respect to $\phi$ gives ${1 \over 2^{\eta - 1}}_2F_1({1 \over 2}, {2 - \eta \over 2};{3 \over 2};1)$ and we left with the integral of the form like in the very beginning of this question. Parameters $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ bear similar geometric meaning, $\epsilon = 0$, $\eta = 0$ gives a rectangular shape, as $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ approach 1 the shape becomes more like normal ellipse and high values of $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ give shapes with pointy cornets like stars, see the illustration at Paul Bourke's web page .

  $$\forall t\in[a,b],u'(t)=f(u(t))\text{ and }u(a)=u(b)=k\in\mathbb{R}.$$
  Show that $u$ must be constant. What I have done : We show that $\max u=k$ (and a similar proof would show that $\min u=k).$ Let's suppose that $\max u=M>k.$ We note $c\in]a,b[$ a point such that $u(c)=M.$ The mean value theorem give us a point $d^+\in ]a,c[$ such that $$u'(d^+)=\frac{u(c)-u(a)}{c-a}=\frac{M-k}{c-a}>0.$$ We note $m=u(d^+).$ The intermediate value theorem tell us that it exists a point $d^-\in]c,b[$ such that $u(d^-)=m$ : we can suppose that $u'(d^-)\leq 0,$ else we would have that, for all $x\in]c,b[$ such that $u(x)=m,$ $u'(x)>0.$ It would be true in particular for $x_{max},$ the biggest $x$ such that $u(x)=m$ : as $u'$ is continuous, it would give us $u'(t)>0$ for $t$ in a neighborhood $[x_l,x_r]$ of $x_{max},$ which would implies $$\int_{x_{max}}^{x_r}u'(t)\,dt=u(x_r)-u(x_{max})>0,$$ and so $u(x_r)>m.$ By continuity of $u$, it is impossible (mean value theorem applied to $u$ on $[x_r,b]$ : there would be no point in this interval which would reach $m$, while $u(x_r)>m$ and $u(c)<m$). Finally, we have two points $d^+$ and $d^-$ such that 
$$0<u'(d^+)=f(u(d^+))=f(m)=f(u(d^-))=u'(d^-)\leq 0,$$ 
and so a contradiction. We get our result. My question : Is my proof correct ? And if yes, is there a faster way to prove that result ? Thank you for your time ! Edit : After some discussion with Jonas, we agree that this proof is correct and are talking about details in this specific way of proving that result. I am starting a bounty to answer the second part of my question : does someone see a faster way to solve it ? Thank you for your attention.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'proof-verification']"
1649814,Birth-death Process/Extinction,"Random processes in Continuous time.
Given that $\beta = \frac{4}{5}*\mu$ I have calculated that the birth rate $= 0.4$ and the death rate $= 0.5$. If the initial population $X(0)=6$, how many events (births and deaths) are there until the population dies out? This is an embedded process $\{X_n;\:n=0,1,...\}$. Is this possible to work out with so little information?
It's all I have.","['random-walk', 'statistics', 'probability']"

1649828,Ratios of the major axes of ellipses inscribed in a triangle,"I recently came across a question that went something like this: In a triangle with vertices (0,0), (6,0), (2,4) an ellipse is inscribed such that it has the largest area. Now it is dilated, that is zoomed in, or enlarged while keeping it's center as well as orientation fixed, so that the new ellipse trisects the sides of the triangle. So what is the ratio of the lengths of the major axes of the new ellipse to the previous one? And here is what I could gather from what I knew: The inscribed ellipse or 'inellipse' of the largest area that can be inscribed in a triangle is known as the Steiner inellipse and many of it's properties are known. The properties that might help us here are that it is tangent to the triangle sides at it's midpoints, the lengths of it's axes can be determined by the formula (g = semi major axis length, h = semi minor axis length) $${g=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+2Z}/6}$$ $${h=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2-2Z}/6}$$
where $${Z=\sqrt{a^4+b^4+c^4-(ab)^2-(bc)^2-(ca)^2}}$$ and the centroid of the triangle is it's center. So now we can find the two foci of the ellipse by the concept that the angle bisector of the angle formed by the normal and the tangent to the ellipse at  point passes through the focus. So we simply find the angle bisectors at the 3 points of tangency, because we know the equations of the tangent's and normal there, and then find the intersection points of these 3 angle bisectors. They will thus determine 2 points which are the foci of the inellipse. So the line joining them must be the major axis of the ellipse. Now when we extend the ellipse to make it trisect the 3 sides of the triangle it passes through 6 known points, and we know of a way to find the equation of a unique ellipse given 5 points of the ellipse. From here we can find out the equation of the new ellipse, and it's major axis will be the same line as the major axis of the previous ellipse because we have only dilated it, keeping orientation fixed. But we already know the equation of the major axis of the previous ellipse. So we solve the equation of the second ellipse and the equation of the major axis to get the coordinates of the vertices of the ellipse. Thus we know the length of the major axis of the new ellipse as well. Now we have to find the ratio of these 2 lengths. However this is only what I have thought of doing, and I know that it is perfectly okay and will work, but could someone please tell me a better approach of trying this problem. Because although I know how to do it, implementing it manually would be no mean task, and certainly not doable in any examination hall. So a better and shorter method is highly solicited from you all, probably using any minute observation that may be useful and that I am missing.
