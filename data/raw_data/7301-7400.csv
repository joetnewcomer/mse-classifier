55289,Understanding a congruence relation in $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$,"I'm having some difficulty understanding the relation between two different congruences I've been dealing with. These come from Exercise 25 of Chapter 3 in Ireland and Rosen's Number Theory. Let $\lambda=1-\omega\in\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, where $\omega$ is the cube root of unity. If $\alpha\equiv 1\pmod{\lambda}$, then $\alpha^3\equiv 1\pmod{9}$. Some algebra shows that $3=-\omega^2\lambda^2$. If $9|\alpha^3-1$, then I want to show that $\omega^4\lambda^4=\omega\lambda^4|\alpha^3-1$. Factoring, I see $\alpha^3-1=(\alpha-1)(\alpha-\omega)(\alpha-\omega^2)$. Now it's given $\lambda|\alpha-1$, also,
$$
\alpha-\omega\equiv 1-\omega\equiv 0\pmod{\lambda},
$$
and
$$
\alpha-\omega^2\equiv 1-\omega^2=(1-\omega)(1+\omega)\equiv 0\pmod{\lambda}.
$$
From this I see $\lambda^3|\alpha^3-1$. But how can I show there is a fourth factor $\lambda$ and one of $\omega$ ? Thanks for any help.","['eisenstein-integers', 'number-theory']"
55297,What are the rules for basic algebra when modulo real numbers are involved,"That is, real numbers modulo an integer. I'm just interested in shuffling around the $+$ , $-$ , $*$ , and $/$ operations. In case a concrete example helps, here's my current problem. (I'm from a programming background so there's probably a notation disconnect, sorry about that.) $$ LI(x) = (LI_0 + x / PI) \bmod 1 $$ $$ LF(x) = (LF_0 + x / PF) \bmod 1 $$ $$ LI(s) + 0.5 = LF(f) $$ $$ f = s + PT / 2 $$ I need to find a solution for $s$ , given $LI_0$ , $LF_0$ , $PI$ , $PF$ and $PT$ . Also I think I might have a solution by dropping the "" $\bmod 1$ ""s, solving for $s$ and then modding that by: $$\frac{1}{ \left| \frac{1}{PI} - \frac{1}{PF} \right| }$$ But I can't tell if that actually works because it introduces an enormous rounding error. Also, while this is the problem at hand and solving it is my immediate goal, I really want to understand how to generate that solution, for next time.","['modular-arithmetic', 'linear-algebra']"

My difficulty with the normal is with the absolute value sign with $|dz|$, which I interpret in the following way. Set $z = x+ iy$ with $x,y$ real, $$|dz| = \left( \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+ \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2\right)^{1/2} dt$$ where $t \in I$ parametrizes the path $\gamma$.

55305,subset relations among Sobolev spaces and their duals,"This may be a rather dense question, but I would nevertheless be grateful for some guidance. The question has to do with the Sobolev spaces $H^m (\Omega)$ on an open bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $m \geq 0$ is integer.  These are Hilbert spaces; thus the Riesz representation theorem tells us that there is a one-to-one and onto correspondence between elements of $H^m (\Omega)$ and elements of its dual $H^{-m} (\Omega)$.  Yet, we also have the inclusion property $H^{m} (\Omega) \subset L_2 (\Omega) \subset H^{-m} (\Omega)$ (e.g. Oden and Reddy, Intro. to the Mathematical Theory of Finite Elements, p. 108).  How can both of these hold?

Obvously, $m = n -1 $ (at least an in the real case). There are a couple of questions: Does there always exist a bounding projective space. And if not, what are the demands on your $M^n$ to have a bounding projective space (that is, apart from the obvious ones) ? When does non-orientability of the bounding projective space implies non-orientability of the $M^n$ (Obviously, when $\partial M^{2n+1}=\mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^{2n}$, then the boundary is non-orientable) ? When does a complex projective space $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ bounds ? And is there any ""aftereffect"" (i.e. are there some specific properties that such a (probably smooth) $2n-1$-manifold has because of the complex structure of the bounding $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$) visible in the manifold that it bounds because of the complex structure of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ ? Does the fake complex projective plane bounds anything ?

The probability of winning is the product of the two other players picking up lower cards in this case $$\frac{8}{9} \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{56}{72}$$ The probability of losing is the probability that either player draws a higher card (the ten) $$\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{17}{72}$$ Given that player 1 can only win or lose and there is no way that there can be a draw why do these probabilities add to make more than one?

While drawing cards from the deck, a first ace is drawn at rank $k$ (that is the $k^{th}$ card drawn is an ace, all previous were not). We want to find the expected number of additional draws until we get an ace. My idea is to follow this route: If I call $X$ the random variable of the rank of the second ace, $N=52$ the total number of cards, $p = N -k$ the remaining number of cards after the first ace is drawn, the idea is to plug the expectation value of $X$ $$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{p-3}i  P(X=i)$$ But the formula doesn't seem to simplify.

55366,Symmetry of Solution to Classical 3-Dimensional Isoperimetric Problem,"A while ago I attempted to solve the classical isoperimetric problem in 3-dimensions, namely ""Find the surface that has the smallest surface area for a given volume"". At that time for me to write down the full Euler-Lagrange equations for such a problem was too tough, so I made the assumption that the solution to this problem was a surface of revolution about an axis. The functional in question then becomes only a function of $y$ ( from the calculus version of Pappus's Centroid Theorem) . Questions: How is such an assumption justified? I remember reading through some results of Antonio Ros, Manuel Ritoré, Fred Almgren, Michael Hutchings et. al on the double bubble conjecture. I didn't really understand them, and I don't even remember the paper I looked at that had at least a useful result within my reach. Upon substituting such a functional into the Euler-Lagrange equations (for the case of a functional dependent only on $y$ and $y'$ ), one gets the differential equation $\frac{2}{\sqrt{1+y'^2}} + \lambda y = C$ , where $C$ is a constant and $\lambda$ the Lagrange multiplier. Now if $C = 0$ the equation of a circle is a solution, and one gets $C= 0$ by appplying the boundary conditions $y(a) = y(b)=0$ , namely that the endpoints of such a curve (well curve because we are talking of a surface of revolution) lie on the $x$ -axis. What happens if $C$ is not zero? Apparently this would give rise to a different surface (as Delaunay) studied. Are there several solutions to the given differential equation that satisfy the problem?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'calculus-of-variations']"
55375,How are Blackjack Basic Strategy tables calculated (What is the maths behind them),"Lets assume a very basic set of rules and table for them, these rules are unlikely to be seen in any casino and the reason is clear, there is only a 0.04% edge in favour of the casino, this could be beaten without ever counting cards simply by applying basic strategy and not even knowing the exceptions to it. Here are the rules. 1). We always start with a full deck of cards. a). Assume this for 2 reasons, first the count (for card counters) is irrelevant as there is not enough cards out to establish a pattern (such patterns can affect the way you play using basic strategy and therefore the stats of the game). b). Second it means we are always working from the same base numbers outlined below 2). We have 1 full deck of 52 cards 3). 4 of these cards are gone out of the deck leaving 48 (these 4 cards are the first 4 used in play above) 4). One of the 4 cards above in point 3 are unknown (because it is the dealers face down card) 5). This leaves only 3 cards whose value are known to us (from which we make all our decisions) 6). After the game is finished, all the cards are replaced in the deck and the deck is reshuffled to begin again (this brings us back to point 1 to repeat the process for every game). I cannot include screenshots because I am new to this forum. But I wanted to post one of a basic strategy table with the rules specified. If the dealer up card is 6, and your two cards show a total of 14 (perhaps 8 and 6, or 9 and 4, it does not matter the combination), you should stand (take no more cards). However if your hand was an A3 (soft 14), you should double down. Finally if your hand was a 77, (double 7), you should split. The questions I have are, what are these decisions based on. The reasons for questioning these tables are because almost every website or book quotes such tables without explaining the maths behind them. And when the maths is outlined, it’s usually done in either a convoluted and inefficient way, or over simplified to the point that it does not explain properly the other decisions in the table. Essentially what I am asking is how do you calculate your next move given a set of rules and a specific hand. Meaning how exactly are the three examples above worked out. Is there a specific formula that can be used so that I may program it and build my own tables.","['recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"
55386,Was Grothendieck familiar with Stone's work on Boolean algebras?,"In short, my question is: Was Grothendieck familiar with Stone's work on Boolean algebras? Background: In an answer to Pierre-Yves Gaillard's question Did Zariski really define the Zariski topology on the prime spectrum of a ring? I let myself get carried away and explained a result of Grothendieck that (for me) implies that Grothendieck certainly was familiar with Stone's work on spectra and even proved theorems with it. Qiaochu suggested that I ask a question and answer myself (apparently officially encouraged , see his remark), so I'm doing that in order to avoid an off-topic answer to Pierre-Yves's question. Qiaochu's accepted answer quotes excerpts from Johnstone's Stone spaces that seem to imply that Grothendieck never quoted Stone. Precisely I'm having the following passage in mind: But again, one will not find any reference to Stone in the work of Grothendieck, even though his use of the word 'spectrum' is an obvious echo of [Stone 1940] , and Grothendieck, with his background in functional analysis, must have been familiar with Stone's work in that field. I did not seriously try to verify or falsify the first part of the sentence (and please do provide references if you happen to know of them). My own long answer addresses the second part of the sentence and tries to make a point that must have been should be replaced by was . Now fire away and complain about this being a nitpick, but I'm trying to explain a nice and interesting piece of mathematics and both Jonas Meyer and Qiaochu Yuan said I should post this answer, so: that's what I'm doing here.","['banach-spaces', 'math-history', 'tensor-products', 'category-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

55439,Gay Speed Dating Problem,"Here's an interesting problem that I came up with the other night. With straight speed dating, (assuming the number of men and women are equal) the number of iterations that need to be made before every man has chatted with every woman is N/2, where N is the total number of people. Gay speed dating is much more complex. The traditional model obviously won't work. Assuming in straight speed dating, the men stay at their tables, the ""sitting"" men in gay speed dating won't meet one another (nor will the ""standing"" men). Counting combinations in gay speed dating manually, I see the following numbers: f(2) = 1
f(3) = 3
f(4) = 3
f(5) = 5
f(6) = 5 These numbers suggest that gay speed dating can be done with N or N-1 iterations (albeit in a much more chaotic pattern). Anyone have any ideas? Also, if it is N iterations, would there be a pattern that could be followed? I.e.: could the gentlemen circle a rectangular table in a clockwise fashion, then rearrange themselves and continue in another fashion such that given any number of men, every man would be paired with every other man in the smallest number of iterations and without pairing two men together twice.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

55445,When do we get extraneous roots?,"There are only two situations that I am aware of that give rise to extraneous roots, namely, the “square both sides” situation (in order to eliminate a square root symbol), and the “half absolute value expansion” situation (in order to eliminate taking absolute value). An example of the former is $\sqrt{x} = x – 2$, and an example of the latter is $|2x – 1| = 3x + 6$. In the former case, by squaring both sides we get roots of $1$ and $4$, and inspection reveals that $1$ is extraneous. (Of course, squaring both sides is a special case of raising both sides to an positive even power.) In the latter case we expand the equation into the two equations $2x – 1 = 3x + 6$ and $2x – 1 = -(3x + 6)$, getting roots of $-1$ and $-7$, and inspection reveals that $-7$ is extraneous. Now, my question is: Is there any other situation besides these two that gives rise to extraneous roots? -Perhaps something involving trigonometry? I asked this question some time ago in MO, where I got ground in the dirt like a wet french fry (as Joe Bob would say). So, I’m transferring the question here to MSE. :) edit (1.Jan.2017):
In general, in mathematics and the real world, you get extraneous roots any time you are initially presented with (via some mechanical / automated / canonical process) a superset of the set that you want, and the sifting out of that set from the superset is left to you, for example, when panning for gold, or when reading the owner’s manual for your vehicle: “This owner’s manual covers all models of your vehicle.

55449,In what sense is Taniyama-Shimura the $n=2$ case of Langlands?,"As I understand it (If I'm imprecise, as I will likely be, please correct me), Langlands says roughly as follows: For every representation $Gal(\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ we can form a function, called the associated $L$-function. There is such a thing called an automorphic form, which in the $n=2$ case is just a modular form (is this right? I have a feeling that there's a subtlety missing here, but I will continue, as this is not yet the gist of my question). For each automorphic form we may associate a function, confusingly also called the associated $L$-function (except now it's associated to an automorphic form rather than a Galois representation). Langlands says that we get the same set of functions from both of these constructions. (although, as I understand it, it doesn't really say much about what this bijection is) However, Taniyama-Shimura is phrased in terms of elliptic curves! I'm trying to relate it to something I would recognize as being my rough sketch for Langlands in $n=2$ case. It is true if an elliptic curve is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ then one would get a representation of $Gal(\mathbb{Q})$ by its action on the vector space $H^1(E,\mathbb{Q}_l)$ (in the etale sense, for various prime $l$). But this is confusing to me: are all $2$-dimensional representations of this form? And what about this weird varying $l$ (shouldn't the representations ultimately be over $\mathbb{C}$ as in my statement of Langlands, or was that wrong?)? And how does any of this relate to the phrasing of Taniyama-Shimura that says that any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ has a rational map into it from some $X_0(N)$ with integer coefficients? I hope you can help my confusion... Edit:
Let me focus my question: in what sense does an elliptic curve give a 2-dimensional representation? (do you look at the first etale cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}_l$ and then basechange to $\mathbb{C}$ and it turns out to be indep. of both $l$ and the embedding into $\mathbb{C}$?) And secondly, do all two dimension (do I need the word ""irreducible"" here?) representations of the Galois group of the rationals arise from an elliptic curve in this way?","['modular-forms', 'number-theory']"

55509,Choosing set of best estimators for linear least squares,"I have a measured experimental dataset which is well approximated by the sum of several basis functions in linear combinations. Linear least squares of course gives me the optimal weight for each basis function.  These basis functions are all unrelated and may or may not be correlated (or even repeated). That still doesn't cause any problem when fitting.. least squares is well defined and I always get optimal weights. My question is about choosing the best subset of these basis functions to represent my data. If I'm allowed to use say only up to 7 of the 20 basis functions I have, how should I pick the 7?   I realize I can just use the covariance matrix and cut out rows and columns to solve the fit for any set of 7 I like, but is there an optimal strategy for choosing the best 7 to fit my data? Enumerating all sets of 7 would be expensive (20 choose 7 = 77520) and what happens if I have 100 or 1000 input base functions? My first thought is to find the one basis function (out of 20) that best approximates the data, and greedily ""accept"" that one. I then look at the remaining 19 contributors, and take the one that best helps. Repeat 7 times. 
This seems like a reasonable strategy, but I don't know if it finds the best set of choices, or even if it's efficient. I haven't found discussion of choosing subsets in such a fit in my linear algebra or multivariate statistics texts, nor Google. This must be a common question, I can think of many examples where you'd use it. (Pick the best 3 weather stations to query to mix to find your local conditions.

Then we need to show that $\sqrt[3]3$ is algebraic of degree 3 over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]2)$. Since $\sqrt[3]3$ is a zero of $x^3-3$, its degree is at most 3. To show that $\sqrt[3]3$ is not of degree 1, i.e. $\sqrt[3]3 \not\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]2)$, suppose that $\sqrt[3]3=a+b\sqrt[3]2+c\sqrt[3]4$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Q}$. (The usual degree argument is not available since $\deg(\sqrt[3]3,\mathbb{Q})=3$ divides $\deg(\sqrt[3]2,\mathbb{Q})=3$.) Cubing both sides, $3=p+q\sqrt[3]2+r\sqrt[3]4$ with some $p, q, r$ in $\mathbb{Q}$, so $\sqrt[3]2$ is a zero of $rx^2+qx+p-3$, which is a contradiction to $\deg(\sqrt[3]2,\mathbb{Q})=3$. Now to prove $\sqrt[3]3$ is not of degree 2, suppose that $\sqrt[3]3$ is a zero of quadratic polynomial. This means that $\sqrt[3]9=p\sqrt[3]3+q$ for some $p,q \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]2)$. Cubing both sides, $9=3p^3+q^3+3p\sqrt[3]3q(\sqrt[3]3p+q)=3p^3+q^3+9pq:=a+b\sqrt[3]2+c\sqrt[3]4$ for some $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Q}$, which leads to the same contradiction. Actually I didn't know how to solve it but while writing out this question, it seems that I solved the problem. But is the above solution right? And is there any other way to solve it? At first, I tried to show that $x=\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{3}$ is algebraic of degree 9 over $\mathbb{Q}$. Cubing yields that $x^3=5+3 \sqrt[3]{6}x$, so $(x^3-5)^3=162x^3$, so $x^9-15x^6-87x^3-125=0$ has $\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{3}$ as a zero. But I couldn't show that it is irreducible (Eisenstein criterion with $p=5$ fails.) Edit: As Alex pointed out, it is sufficient to show that $x^3-3$ has no roots in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$. And as Gerry pointed out, this process some more work than the above(check the nonzero condition). Suppose $(a+b\sqrt[3]2+c\sqrt[3]4)^3=3$. I did the heavy computation, $a^3+2b^3+4c^3+12abc+3\sqrt[3]2(a^2b+2b^2c+2c^2a)+3\sqrt[3]4(a^2c+b^2a+2c^2b)=3$, and stuck on here. How can I proceed here?","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

Okay it seems quite obvious, but if I try to make a strict argument I find a missing step. I tried to approach this from both sides: From the independence follows, that $X$ is independent of $\sigma(Y) \cup \sigma(Z)$. The first expression is, more exactly $=E(X| \sigma(Y,Z))$. $\sigma(Y,Z)=\sigma(\sigma(Y) \cup \sigma(Z))$. It is known, that in general $\sigma(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}) \neq \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B} (*)$ for $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$.

55626,Asymptotic behavior of $\sum_{i>0} x^{p_i}$ as $x \to 1^-$,"The sum of natural numbers $ \sum_{n>0} x^n = \frac{x}{1-x}$, so as $x\to1^-$ it diverges as $(1-x)^{-1}$.

EDIT After receiving helpful suggestions,  I guess I understand it a little better. If $A$ is a finite subset, than $ \lim_{x\to 1^-} \sum_{n \in A} x^n = \vert A \vert$. Thus $$
   \lim_{x\to 1^-} \frac{\sum_{k \in (A \cap (1,n))} x^k}{\sum_{k=1}^n x^k} = \frac{\vert A \vert}{n}
$$ Taking the limit $n\to \infty$ the ratio gives the asymptotic density of $A$ in $\mathbb{N}$ if it exists. Indeed $$
 \sum_{n=1}^\infty x^{2n} = \frac{x^2}{1-x^2}  \;\;\; \text{ therefore } \;\;\; \lim_{x->1^-} (1-x) \frac{x^2}{1-x^2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$ What I still do not understand is how would I find the asymptotic behavior of the sum in case when the limit $\frac{\vert A\vert}{n}$ goes to zero, like in the case of $A$ being the set of prime numbers $A = \mathbb{P}$. I guess the technique to be used here is to apply Mellin transform, and related the divergence rate to properties of zeta function. $$

55651,Nonnegative linear functionals over $l^\infty$,"My purpose is a clarification of the role of the axiom of choice in constructing limits for bounded sequences. Namely, we want a linear functional of norm 1 defined on the space of all bounded complex sequences that takes nonnegative sequences to nonnegative numbers. We also want that it annihilate all sequences with finite number of nonzero elements, and that it take constant sequences to the same constant. It is well known that such functionals can be realized as limits along free ultrafilters, thus the axiom of choice is needed. I would like to understand if the construction can be simplified if, instead of the ultrafilters, we allow functionals with properties as described above. Here are my questions: Does there exist an explicit construction of such a functional? If not, does this mean that there are formal reasons why the explicit construction cannot exist? Is it possible to establish the fact that the functional exists without using the axiom of choice? Update after discussion: It is important that there are different ""levels"" of the axiom of choice. If I felt this better when I wrote this posting, I would also add the following question answered below in the affirmative: Is it possible to construct the functional as desired without ultrafilters, but with using only the Hahn-Banach theorem for the space $l^\infty$?

55659,Combinatorial interpretation of Binomial Inversion,"It is known that if $f_n = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} g_i \binom{n}{i}$ for all $0 \le n \le m$, then $g_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^{i+n} f_i \binom{n}{i}$ for $0 \le n \le m$. This sort of inversion is called binomial inversion , for obvious reasons. Many nice elegant proofs exist (my favorite uses exponential generating functions of $f_n$ and $g_n$), and also many applications (such as proving that if polynomial $f$ of degree $n$ assumes integers values on $0,1,\cdots,n$, then $f(i) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all integers $i$). What I'm interested is the following: A nice inclusion-exclusion proof - similar to interpreting Möbius inversion as inclusion-exclusion. If $f_0 = g_0 = 0$ and $i | f_i$ for $i>1$, we get, by the Binomial Inversion, that $i | g_i$ (reason: $i\binom{n}{i} = n\binom{n-1}{i-1}$). Is there a nice combinatorial interpretation of this phenomena? Nice applications?

55661,Identify this combinatorial construction,"I am no combinateur, but I stumbled across the following construction when studying an operad arising from information theory (actually it's a special algebra of an A$_\infty$-operad). It looked familiar to me, but I could not place it. I was hoping someone here could throw me some search terms. The construction is essentially a map $\phi$ from the set of rooted trees to the positive reals arising from some operations on the positive reals, $+$ and a collection of operations, one for each $n$, $\oplus_n$, taking $n$ arguments. Every one of these operations is symmetric and $+$ distributes over $\oplus_n$ for each $n$. There is a notion of composition of trees, which is just root-to-leaf adjoining of graphs. We require that whenever a tree, $T$, can be written as a composition of an $n$-corolla (ie. a rooted tree with $n+1$ vertices and $n$ leaves) and $n$ trees $A_1,..,A_n$, then $\phi(T)=\phi(n$-corolla$)+\oplus_n(\phi(A_1),...,\phi(A_n))$. So that $\phi$ is completely determined by its values on the set of $n$-corollae for each $n$. I was wondering if $\phi$ had a name or a combinatorial interpretation. For me, it is an internal algebra in an algebra where the trees correspond simultaneously to search algorithms, guessing strategies, ways of building up information measures, and ways of associating variables. The map is actually defined more generally for such trees, since these trees act via $\oplus_n$ on the positive reals as prescribed by the $A_\infty$-operad. This allows us to define a more general recursion relation than the one above, but all are equivalent, so I will not fill this post with those technicalities. Thanks.","['trees', 'combinatorics']"

I also plugged this into Wolfram Alpha but whenever complex things come into play WA has a tendency (at least for me) to give some strange answers sometimes (especially when branch cuts and things come up).

(b) Prove that $f(f^{-1}(B_0)) \subset B_0 $, show that $B_0 = f(f^{-1}(B_0))$ if $f$ is surjective. Conceptually, the ideas are simple. In (a), let $S$ be the image set of $A_0$ under $f$ (sorry if I use non-conventional notation, I'm still somewhat new to this). This means that $S= \{ b \mid f(a)=b \text{ for at least one } a \}$.

56016,Are the axioms for abelian group theory independent?,"(I give a lengthy introduction to a concise question -- scroll down if you want to jump straight up to the question). Recall that abelian group theory consists of two primitive symbols: $\cdot$ which is a binary function symbol, and $e$ which is a constant. The axioms are: ( $G_1$ ) $\forall x \forall y \forall z \ \ x\cdot (y\cdot z)=(x\cdot y)\cdot z$ ( $G_2$ ) $\forall x \ \ x\cdot e=x$ ( $G_3$ ) $\forall x \exists y \ \ x\cdot y=e$ ( $G_4$ ) $\forall x \forall y \ \ x\cdot y =y \cdot x$ A set of axioms $\Phi$ is independent if for every $\varphi\in \Phi$ there exists an interpretation $\mathcal{I}$ such that $\mathcal{I} \models \Phi\setminus \{\varphi\}$ and $\mathcal{I}\not\models \varphi$ . In non-formal logic language, $\mathcal{I}\models \Phi$ means: exhibit a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ and an element $e\in G$ such that all axioms in $\Phi$ are satisfied (taking the variables as belonging to $G$ ). So, to prove that the above axioms are independent is to exhibit, for every $i=1,\dots,4$ , a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ and an element $e\in G$ such that $(G_j)$ holds for every $j\not=i$ , and $(G_i)$ does not hold. Thusly you prove that you can't prove $(G_i)$ from $\{(G_j), j\not=i\}$ . A cute and fun problem in Ebbinghaus, Mathematical Logic (exercise 4.14, p. 39) asks us to prove that the group theory axioms, i.e. $\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3)\}$ is an independent set of axioms. This is fun to do. But then the natural follow-up question that occurred to me is: is $\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3) ,(G_4)\}$ an independent set of axioms? For $i=2,3,4$ it is easy to prove that there are models of $\{(G_j):j\not=i\}$ where $(G_i)$ does not hold. (In fact, for $i=2,3$ , the ones I have thought for the exercise in Ebbinghaus were all commutative, and thus worked; for $i=4$ it's just the existence of non-abelian groups). But for $i=1$ I'm having a really hard time. I tried a lot of examples, neither of which works. To sum up, I'm trying to prove that: There exists a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ such that: $\cdot$ is not associative, $\cdot$ is commutative, there is an identity element $e$ , and every element has an inverse with respect to $e$ . The best I could do was the following. Take $G=\mathbb{R}^2$ , with $(a,b)\cdot (c,d)=(ac+bd,0)$ . It is commutative, not associative, the inverse with respect to $(0,0)$ is $(b,-a)$ , but $(a,b)\cdot (0,0)=(0,0)$ , not $(a,b)$ , whence $(0,0)$ is not an identity element. Or perhaps I'm just wrong and $(G_2), (G_3), (G_4)$ imply $(G_1)$ , which would come off as a surprise.","['logic', 'group-theory']"

Quadratic reciprocity can be stated like this: Let $\rho: Gal(\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow GL_1(\mathbb{C})$ be a $1$ -dimensional representation that factors through $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{W})/\mathbb{Q})$ . Then for any $\sigma \in Gal(\mathbb{Q})$ , $\sigma(\sqrt{W})=\rho(\sigma)\sqrt{W}$ . Define for each prime number $p$ an operator on the space of functions from $(\mathbb{Z}/4|W|\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ to $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ by $T(p)$ takes the function $\alpha$ to the function that takes $x$ to $\alpha(\frac{x}{p})$ . Then there is a simultaneous eigenfunction $\alpha$ , with eigenvalue $a_p$ for $T(p)$ , such that for all $p\not|4|W|$ $\rho(Frob_p)=a_p$ . (and to relate it to the undergraduate-textbook-version of quadratic reciprocity, one need only note that $\rho(Frob_p)$ is just the Legendre symbol $\left( \frac{W}{p}\right)$ .) Now I'm trying to understand how people think of generalizations of this. First, still in the one dimensional case, let's say we are not working over a quadratic field. What would the generalization be? What would take the place of $4|W|$ ? Would the space of functions that the $T(p)$ 's work on still thes space of functions from $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ to $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ ? What is this $N$ ? Now let's jump to the $2$ -dimensional case. Here we have the actual theory of Hecke operators. However, as I understand it, there is a basis of simultaneous eigenvalues only for the cusp forms. Now I'm finding it hard to match everything up: are we dealing just with irreducible $2$ -dimensional representations? Instead of $\rho$ do we take the character? Would we say that for each representation there's a cusp form such that it's a simultaneous eigenfunction and such that $\xi(Frob_p)=a_p$ (the eigenvalues) where $\xi$ is the character of $\rho$ ? This should probably be for all $p$ that don't divide some $N$ . What is this $N$ ? Does it relate to the cusp forms somehow? Is it their weight? Their level?

56042,Help with an elementary proof regarding cardinalities of finite sets.,"I was relatively confused trying to produce a proof of this theorem, however, I have provided my attempt. I would greatly appreciate it if people can help steer me to the correct proof, or provide a simple fix to my proof if it is near correct. Proposition: If $X$ is a finite set of cardinality $n$, and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a function, then $f(X)$ is a finite set of cardinality less than or equal to $n$. If in addition $f$ is one-to-one then $f(X)$ has cardinality exactly $n$. My Attempt at a Proof: Suppose $X$ is a finite set with cardinality $n$ and $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is a function. It follows that $X$ has $n$ elements, namely $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. Since $f$ is a function it follows that $f(X)$ maps every element of $X$ to exactly one element of $Y$. Thus $f(X)$ contains the elements $f(x_1), f(x_2), ..., f(x_n)$. However, we do not know that each $f(x_i)$  , $0 < i < n$ is unique. Thus we can conclude that $f(X)$ has cardinality less than or equal to $n$. Furthermore suppose $f$ is one-to-one. It then follows the elements $f(x_i)$, $0 < i < n$ are each unique. Thus we can conclude that $f(X)$ contains exactly $n$ elements, and hence has cardinality exactly equal to $n$ Thank you very much in advance for any help. EDIT: (1) Someone asked what the source of my confusion was, I felt that this wasn't really formal and rather I was just attempting to express my intuitive ideas; 
(2) My definition of $X$ is a finite set of cardinality $n$ is that there exists a bijection from $X$ to $\{i\in \mathbb{N} : 1\leq i \leq n\}$;

One particular proof is found in problems 4 and 5 here . Another proof I found on a page at SUNYSB makes use of Pepin's test whose proof seems to require quadratic reciprocity. So out of curiosity, is it possible to prove that any Fermat prime has $3$ as a primitive root without use of quadratic reciprocity? The few observations I do know is that if $2^n+1$ is prime for $n\gt 1$, then $n$ is actually a power of $2$, and that in this case $U(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ has order $2^n$, so the order of $3$ must also be a power of $2$, but I couldn't get much further than that.","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"
56063,Minimum degree of a graph and existence of perfect matching,"I was reading a result where the following proposition appears as a preliminary step (and left as exercise): Claim : Suppose $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices ($n$ even and $n \geqslant 3$) with minimum degree at least $n/2$. Show that $G$ contains a perfect matching. Proof : By Dirac's theorem , $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$. Since $|C|=n$ is an even integer, the set of “odd” edges of $C$ gives a perfect matching for $G$. $\quad\Box$ I feel that using Dirac's theorem for this claim is an overkill. But after trying for a few days, couldn't come up with any other proofs. Can you give a more “direct” proof of the claim that avoids the machinery of Hamiltonian cycles? Naturally, you might object to the vague requirement of “directness”. To clarify what I mean by it, I’ll give an example. Claim 2. Suppose $G$ has a minimum degree at least $n/2$. Show that $G$ is connected. Proof via Dirac's theorem. $G$ has a hamiltonian cycle as before, and hence is connected. $\Box$ A different proof. We'll show that any pair of vertices $u,v$ are connected by a path of length at most $2$. If $uv$ is an edge, we are done. Suppose not. Then $N(u) \cup N(v) \subseteq V \smallsetminus \{u,v\}$. Therefore
  $$
|N(u) \cap N(v)| = |N(u)| + |N(v)| - |N(u) \cup N(v)| \geqslant \frac{n}{2}+\frac{n}{2}-(n-2) = 2 \gt 0.
$$
  In particular there exists vertex $w$ such that $uw$ and $wv$ are both edges, and we are done. $\quad \Box$ I find the proof via Dirac's theorem much less illuminating in this example. In fact, as Qioachu points out below, the Claim 2 might even appear as an intermediate steps of Dirac’s theorem, making the above proof cyclic. My intention here is only to point out that Dirac’s theorem can be used as a powerful black box in killing much easier results.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
56068,On the growth order of an entire function $\sum \frac{z^n}{(n!)^a}$,"Here $a$ is a real positive number. The result is that $f(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \frac{z^n}{(n!)^a}$ has a growth order $1/a$ (i.e. $\exists A,B\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(z)|\leq A\exp{(B|z|^{1/a})},\forall z\in \mathbb{C}$ ). It is Problem 3* from Chapter 5 of E.M. Stein's book, Complex Analysis , page 157. Yet I don't know how to get this. Will someone give me some hints on it? Thank you very much.","['asymptotics', 'calculus', 'complex-analysis']"
56071,Holomorphic/Analytic functions,Let $f$ be a function. Then $f$ is holomorphic is equivalent to $f$ being analytic which in turn is also equivalent to satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. All three concepts imply infinite differentiability. My question is what do we need to add to infinite differentiability to recover analyticity/ holomorphicity/Cauchy Riemann equations?,['complex-analysis']

56088,Function Elements in Weyl's Riemann Surface Text,"Motivation and Background: I'm reading Weyl's text The Concept of a Riemann Surface and I'm having a bit of difficulty.  (I can't find an online version which is not a google book, so if the following terms are non-standard, could someone point me to the more standard terms?)  I will italicize relevant terms for easy reading. He begins by noting that a function element is a power series at some point that converges in some disk of positive radius, and that an analytic function is the collection of all of the function elements gained by analytic continuation.  So far, so good.  He then notes we should further generalize our function elements so that we can include things like poles and branch cuts, and eventually we will get to the concept of an analytic form . Following this, he notes that we can take a power series $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i}(z-a)^{i}$ and introduce some $t$ such that $z = a + t$ so that we now have $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_{i}t^{i}$.  He then notes, ""If we abandon the distinguished role played by $z$ and also allow a finite number of negative powers of $t$, we obtain a more general formulation.""  He then lets $z = P(t)$ and $u = Q(t)$ be any two series with only a finite number of negative powers of $t$ which, for a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin, both converge and no two different values of $t$ in this neighborhood give the same pair of values $(z,u)$.  This pair now defines a function element. Main Question: I do not see how these two series can represent a function element as we defined before.  I also cannot see the significance of having no two different values of $t$ giving the same pair $(z,u)$.  I'm not exactly sure what makes this definition more general than the previous one, and I'm not exactly sure why we cannot introduce branch cuts by using the same analytic continuation techniques as before.  I'm also not sure why replacing ""$z-a$"" with $t$ allows us to ""abandon the distinguished role played by $z$.* If someone could lead me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it!","['riemann-surfaces', 'complex-analysis']"
