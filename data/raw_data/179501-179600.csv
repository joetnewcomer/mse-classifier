3259208,Is there a relation between cylinder set measures and discretization of path integrals?,"Path integral via discretization So let me start with what seems to be the point of view of physicists (corrections are highly appreciated since this is what I understood!). Let a quantum system with coordinates $q_a$ and momenta $p_b$ be given satisfying commutation relations $$[q_a,p_b]=i\delta_{ab}.$$ Further suppose the system has a Hamiltonian $H$ which is time-independent. Usually in that setting the path integral is introduced as a means to compute the transition amplitude $$\langle q',t'|q,t\rangle=\langle q'|e^{-iH(t'-t)}|q\rangle=\int\mathfrak{D}x(t)\exp\left\{iS[x(t)]\right\}$$ This is usually defined by a discretization procedure allied to a Wick rotation to Euclidean time $\tau = it$ to deal with convergence. The right discretization seems to be derived by slicing the time interval, evaluating $\langle q',t'|q,t\rangle$ to first order in $t'-t$ , and imposing some ordering convention. So: a path integral in Physics is defined by the continuum limit of these aforementioned discretizations. Cylinder set measures Now there's the mathematicians point of view on which one studies integration over locally convex vector spaces which are infinite dimensional. In that case, if $E$ is such a space we perform two definitions: Definition : Let $E$ be a locally convex vector space. A cylinder set is defined to be a subset $C\subset E$ of the form $$C=\{x\in E : (\ell_1(x),\dots,\ell_n(x))\in C_0\}$$ where $C_0\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a Borel subset and $\ell_k\in E^\ast$ are continuous linear functionals. Equivalently, it is a preimage $C = P^{-1}(C_0)$ of a Borel set under a continuous linear map $P : E\to \mathbb{R}^n$ . Definition: Let $E$ be a locally convex vector space. A cylinder set measure $\nu$ is a nonnegative additive set function defined on the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by cylinder sets of $E$ such that for any continuous linear $P : E\to \mathbb{R}^n$ the set function $$\nu\circ P^{-1} : B\mapsto \nu(P^{-1}(B))$$ is countably additive. Comparison If we now compare there are a few points to mention: It seems that cylinder sets capture discretizations. If $x$ is a continuous path, $(\ell_1(x),\dots, \ell_n(x))$ is an $n$ -point discretization. To be even more precise in the case of paths we could take $\ell_k(x) = x(t_k)$ for some $t_1,\dots, t_n$ in the interval. In the same way we could take $\ell_k(x) = a_k$ some Fourier coefficient of $x(t)$ . I've seem both things done in Physics. It seems cylinder set measures are in fact a way to define ""a measure per discretization"". So for each discretization we give a measure - integrate over $n$ points, integrate over $n$ Fourier coefficients, so forth. Still, the connection doesn't feel complete for me. The issue is that to define a cylinder set measure we must define $\nu$ on the whole algebra generated by cylinder sets . The Physicist approach seems to do this exactly for a specific collection of cylinder sets. Either for the ones with $\ell_k(x) = x(t_k)$ or for the ones with $\ell(x_k)=a_k$ a Fourier coefficient. But there are infinitely many other choices of the $\ell_k$ which give rise to many more cylinder sets. And one would need still to define $\nu$ on the $\sigma$ -algebra itself. The question : is there really a relation between cylinder set measures and the Physicist discretization of a path integral? If so, how the relation can be made more precise? If not, why not, considering the similarities? Are my interpretations (1) and (2) right? For this discussion, please let us consider the Euclidean path integral. So the issue here is not the imaginary exponent .","['measure-theory', 'wiener-measure', 'functional-analysis', 'gaussian-integral', 'mathematical-physics']"
3259210,Going from $\tan y = \cdots$ to $y=\tan^{-1}(\cdots)$,"I have a question about my teacher's solution to this problem: If $\tan y = \dfrac{x}{b}$ and $\tan z = \dfrac{10+x}{b}$ , solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and $z$ . original question image My Pre-Calculus teacher gave us the above problem, and gave the solution as: $$y = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x\tan z}{10+x}\right) \tag{1}$$ However, I am skeptical. The first few steps of solving this problem were very easy, and I got to where: $$\tan y = \frac{x\tan z}{10+x} \tag{2}$$ However, it seems to me that you cannot simply jump from there to the answer my teacher gave -- that is, that given the statement in the previous line it need not be true (although it could be true) that $y$ equals what it equals in the teacher's answer above. This is because of the restricted range of the arctangent/inverse tangent function: $-\frac{\pi}{2}<y<\frac{\pi}{2}$ . Therefore, aren't there an infinite number of answers to the question? (I'm not entirely sure that my ""need not be true"" statement above is actually the logically correct way of framing my concern, but hopefully you all get a sense of what I'm getting at.)","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"
3259229,Trying to solve $f(x)f(y) = f(x + y)$ [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : continuous functions on $\mathbb R$ such that $g(x+y)=g(x)g(y)$ [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . Let $f$ be a differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x + y) = f(x)f(y)\tag{1}$ If $y=0$ then $f(x + 0) = f(x)f(0)$ which is just $f(x) = f(x)f(0)$ . Then if $f(0) = 0$ , we have $f(x) = f(x)f(0) = f(x) \cdot 0 = 0$ for all $x$ . If $f(0) \neq 0$ instead then $f(0) = f(0 + 0) = f(0)f(0) = f(0)^2$ implies that $0 = f(0)^2 - f(0) = f(0)(f(0) - 1)$ which has solutions $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$ , but since we assume $f(0) \neq 0$ , it must be the case that $f(0) = 1$ . Furthermore let's assume the possibility of some real $z$ such that $f(z) = 0$ . Then for all $x$ we have $f(x) = f(z + (x - z)) = f(z)f(x-z) = 0 \cdot f(x-z) = 0$ . In other words, if the function equals $0$ at one point, it is zero for all of them. The contrapositive is that if the function is nonzero for any value, then it does not equal $0$ anywhere else. Therefore in the case where $f(0) = 1$ , we have $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Going forward we assume the case where $f(0) = 1 \tag{2}$ By induction, $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ for all positive integers $n>0$ as follows. Base case with $n=1$ , we have $f(x)^1 = f(1 \cdot x)$ which is $f(x) = f(x)$ which is trivially true. Inductive step we assume $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ and we must show that $f(x)^{n+1} = f((n+1)x)$ . $\begin{align}
f(x)^n &= f(nx) & \text{By inductive hypothesis}\\
f(x)^n f(x) &= f(nx)f(x) \\
f(x)^{n+1} &= f(nx + x) & \text{By equation (1)}\\
f(x)^{n+1} &= f((n+1)x)
\end{align}$ Thus for the positive integers we prove the result: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^{+}}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{3}$ Next we see that $f(x) = f(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2}) = f(\frac{x}{2})^2$ and since any real number squared is non-negative, we combine this with our assumption that $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and so it follows that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x) > 0 \tag{4}$ so we are free to divide by $f(x)$ values safely without concerning ourselves with division by $0$ issues. Since $1 = f(0) = f(x + (-x)) = f(x)f(-x)$ it follows that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x)^{-1} = f(-x) \tag{5}$ Then for some negative integer $n < 0$ we have $f(x)^n = (f(x)^{-n})^{-1} = f(-nx)^{-1} = f(nx)$ by $(3)$ and $(5)$ . Therefore: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^{-}}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{6}$ We can also directly show that $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ holds for $n=0$ , since $f(x)^0 = 1 = f(0 \cdot x) = f(0)$ which holds by assumption $(2)$ . Now we can conclude: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{7}$ Now if we have $n \neq 0$ we can take the $n$ th root of both sides of equation $(7)$ and get $f(x) = f(nx)^{1/n}$ which also implies that $f(x/n) = f(x)^{1/n}$ . Then for integers $m, n$ with $n \neq 0$ we have $f(m \frac{x}{n}) = f(mx)^{1/n}$ using this result, and then applying equation $(3)$ we transform it to $(f(x)^m)^{1/n}$ or $f(x)^{m/n}$ (again for $n \neq 0$ ). If we let some rational $r = m/n$ then we see that $\forall r \in \mathbb{Q}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(rx) = f(x)^r \tag{8}$ By setting $x=1$ it is revealed that $\forall r \in \mathbb{Q}, \, f(r) = f(1)^r \tag{9}$ And then there's some theory I don't understand that I can apply here when $f$ is continuous (as assumed up front since we say $f$ is differentiable) that lets me jump to $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x) = f(1)^x \tag{10}$ Is my proof right so far?","['functions', 'proof-verification']"
3259253,Einstein manifolds with metric locally conformal to that of a manifold of constant sectional curvature have constant sectional curvature as well,"I'm reading an article from $1988$ from Kuhnel, where I found the following: $\textbf{Proposition}$ . Let $(M, g)$ be a space of constant curvature $K$ and dimension $n \geq 3$ and $\psi: M \to \mathbb{R}$ a function, and $\bar{g} = \psi^{-2}g$ . $\textbf{Then the following are equivalent}$ : $(1)$ $(M, \bar{g})$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $\bar{K}$ $(2) $$(M, \bar{g})$ is Einstein $(3)$ $\nabla^2 \psi = \cfrac{\Delta\psi}{n} \cdot g$ where $
\nabla^{2} \varphi=\nabla(\nabla \varphi)
$ denotes the hessian of $\varphi$ . Here's the proof for $(3) \iff (1)$ (not verbatim): Define $\varphi$ by $\psi \doteq e^{\varphi} $ . Let $\sigma$ be the $2$ -plane spanned by two vectors $X, Y$ which are orthonormal with respect to $g$ . Let $\overline{K}_{\sigma}$ denote the sectional curvature of $\sigma$ in $(M, \bar{g})$ . Then from $(1.2)$ we have: $$
\begin{aligned} \psi^{-2} \overline{K}_{\sigma} &=\langle \overline{{R}}(X, Y) Y, X \rangle\\ &\color{red}{={K}+\nabla^{2} \varphi(Y, Y)+\nabla^{2} \varphi(X, X)+(Y \varphi)^{2}+(X \varphi)^{2}-\|\nabla \varphi\|^{2} }\\ &\color{red}{=K+\frac{2}{n} \cdot \frac{\Delta \psi}{\psi}-\|\nabla \varphi\|^{2} }\end{aligned}
$$ and the  result follows from Schur's theorem. Now, $(1.2)$ is the following: $$
\begin{aligned} \overline{R_{m}}(X, Y) Z &=R_{m}(X, Y) Z-\left[\langle X, Z\rangle H_{\varphi} Y-\langle Y, Z\rangle H_{\varphi} X\right] \\ &+\left[\nabla^{2} \varphi(Y, Z)+(Y \varphi)(Z \varphi)-\langle Y, Z\rangle\|\varphi\|^{2}\right] X \\ &-\left[\nabla^{2} \varphi(X, Z)+(X \varphi)(Z \varphi)-\langle X, Z\rangle\|\varphi\|^{2}\right] Y \\ &+[(X \varphi)\langle Y, Z\rangle-(Y \varphi)\langle X, Z\rangle] \nabla \varphi \end{aligned}
$$ where $$
{H}_{\psi}(X) \doteq \nabla_{X}(\nabla \psi)
$$ I don't understand how the equalities above outlined in red follow from $(1.2)$ . Using $(1.2)$ , I get: $$
\begin{aligned} \overline{R}(X, Y) Y &=R_{m}(X, Y) Y-\left[\langle X, Y\rangle H_{\varphi} Y-\langle Y, Y\rangle H_{\varphi} X\right] \\ &+\left[\nabla^{2} \varphi(Y, Y)+(Y \varphi)(Y \varphi)-\langle Y, Y\rangle\|\varphi\|^{2}\right] X \\ &-\left[\nabla^{2} \varphi(X, Y)+(X \varphi)(Y \varphi)-\langle X, Y\rangle\|\varphi\|^{2}\right] Y \\ &+[(X \varphi)\langle Y, Y\rangle-(Y \varphi)\langle X, Y\rangle] \nabla \varphi \end{aligned}
$$ so that (using the fact $X, Y$ are orthonormal) we have: $$
\begin{aligned} \psi^{-2} \overline{K}_{\sigma} &=\langle \overline{{R}}(X, Y) Y, X \rangle\\ &={K}+ \langle H_{\varphi}X, X \rangle + \nabla^{2} \varphi(Y, Y)+(Y \varphi)^{2} -\|\nabla \varphi\|^{2} + \langle (X\varphi)\nabla \varphi, X \rangle\\ &=K+\nabla^2 \varphi(X, X) +\nabla^2 \varphi(Y, Y) + (Y\varphi)^2  +  \langle (X\varphi)\nabla \varphi, X \rangle-\|\nabla \varphi\|^{2} \end{aligned}
$$ so my doubt is really this one: how/why are the following equalities true: $$\langle (X\varphi)\nabla \varphi, X \rangle = (X\varphi)^2$$ $$\nabla^2 \varphi(X, X) +\nabla^2 \varphi(Y, Y) + (Y\varphi)^2  +  (X\varphi)^2 = \frac{2}{n} \cdot \frac{\Delta \psi}{\psi} $$ EDIT: I'm being silly. The first equality is by definition. The second one is still not solved though.","['curvature', 'manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3259265,Irreducible representations of $SO(2)$ on 2x2 matrices.,"I'm having trouble verifying my understanding of the representation theory of Lie groups (which is minimal) with my experience playing around with the rotations of 2x2 matrices. Specifically, if we consider the space of 2x2 matrices $M_2$ being acted on by the group of rotations $SO(2)$ , it's pretty easy to figure out what the irreducible representations are. $SO(2)$ is generated by $$R(\theta)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\-\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{array}\right)$$ and under the rotation $R(\theta)M_2R^{-1}(\theta)$ , there are three irreducible subspaces: $$\left\{\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right)\right\},\left\{\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\-1&0\end{array}\right)\right\},\left\{\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\1&0\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&-1\end{array}\right)\right\}$$ You can get this just by playing around with Mathematica for a while. I would called this $1\oplus 1\oplus 2$ . However, if I want to try to figure this out ""in the usual way"", I would do the following: Determine the irreducible representations on a single vector space $V$ . Take the tensor product of those $V^*\otimes V$ . To do the first step, I would normally do something like look for a Cartan Subalgebra to construct a diagonal representation, and then look at the action of the other generators to find the irreducible ones. This group is generated by a single element, but it seems like the essence of the process should still work. So let's find a diagonal representation, by just looking for eigenvectors of that rotation matrix. The answer is $$\lambda_{\pm}=\cos\theta\pm i\sin\theta$$ So there are two eigenvectors $v_+$ and $v_-$ , and no other generators, so the irreducible representation is $V=v_+\oplus v_-$ . (that seems right - no vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ should be left invariant by this rotation) So now the tensor product is generated by $$(v_+\oplus v_-)\otimes(v_+\oplus v_-),$$ with eigenvectors $$R(\theta)(v_+\otimes v_+)=\lambda_+^2(v_+\otimes v_+)$$ $$R(\theta)(v_+\otimes v_-)=\lambda_+\lambda_-(v_+\otimes v_-)$$ $$R(\theta)(v_-\otimes v_+)=\lambda_+\lambda_-(v_-\otimes v_+)$$ $$R(\theta)(v_+\otimes v_-)=\lambda_-^2(v_-\otimes v_-)$$ So I might now say that the three invariant subspaces above are generated by $v_+\otimes v_+$ , $v_-\otimes v_-$ , and $v_+\otimes v_-+v_-\otimes v_+$ , respectively. But for example, $v_+\otimes v_+$ sure looks more like $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}a&a\\b&b\end{array}\right)$$ not $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right)\sim\left(\begin{array}{cc}a&0\\0&a\end{array}\right)$$ Is there something here I am missing?","['representation-theory', 'matrices', 'orthogonal-matrices', 'lie-groups', 'rotations']"

3259437,Ring of invariants of unimodular matrices acting on real square matrices,"Suppose that $M(\Bbb R,n)$ is the set of all $n \times n$ square real matrices. The special linear group $\text{SL}(\Bbb R,n)$ acts on this group via right-multiplication. It is easy to see that the determinant will be preserved under the group action, so that for any $A \in M(\Bbb R,n)$ and $B \in \text{SL}(\Bbb R,n)$ , we have $\det(AB) = \det(A)$ . Additionally, on this Wikipedia page , it claims that this is basically the only polynomial on the coefficients of $A \in M(\Bbb R,n)$ that is preserved for arbitrary $B \in \text{SL}(\Bbb R,n)$ , in that any other polynomial preserved is just a linear combination of powers of the determinant. That is, the ring of invariants of the special linear group is generated entirely from the determinant. A fairly important subgroup of $\text{SL}(\Bbb R,n)$ is $\text{SL}(\Bbb Z,n)$ , the group of integer unimodular matrices with determinant equal to +1. This is just the subgroup of the special linear group whose coefficients are integers.

3259788,Partition of a rectangle into squares problem,"recently I encountered this problem:
""Show that a rectangle can be partitioned into finitely many squares if and only if the ratio of its sides is rational."" I have found the a solution which I need help to understand: Clearly, every rectangle with rational ratio of sides can be partitioned into finitely many equal squares. Thus, the interesting part of the problem is the ""only if"" one.
  Proof via Dirichlet's simultaneous rational approximation theorem
  Without loss of generality, we may assume that both sides of our
  rectange are greater than $1$ . We can choose a positive integer $q$ such that the product of every coordinate of every vertex of every
  square in our partition becomes almost an integer after multiplication
  by $q$ . So, we may assume that all these coordinates differ from
  integers by, at most, $\frac 15$ . Now let $a$ and $b$ be the
  horizontal and the vertical side of our rectangle, respectively, and
  let $s_i$ be the sides of the squares in the partition. Denote by $\tilde x$ the nearest integer to $x$ . Now, draw the horizontal lines
  at all half-integer heights (i.e., the heights $\pm\frac 1 2,\pm\frac
 3 2,\dots$ ) and look at the total length $L$ of these lines within our
  rectangle. On one hand, we have $L=a\tilde b$ . (There are $\tilde b$ lines intersecting our rectangle and each of them intersects it by an
  interval of length $a$ .) On the other hand, looking at what happens in
  each square, we get $L=\sum_i s_i\tilde s_i$ . Thus $a\tilde b=\sum_is_i\tilde s_i$ . Similarly, drawing the vertical lines through
  half-integer points, we arrive at the identity $b\tilde a =\sum_i
 s_i\tilde s_i$ . Thus $a\tilde b=b\tilde a$ , i.e., $\frac a b=\frac
 {\tilde a}{\tilde b}\in\mathbb Q$ . I didn't understood why did he had to use Dirichlet  theorem in order to draw line on each side, particulary I didnt understood why did he had to do this and how everything in this part connected: Without loss of generality, we may assume that both sides of our
  rectange are greater than $1$ . We can choose a positive integer $q$ such that the product of every coordinate of every vertex of every
  square in our partition becomes almost an integer after multiplication
  by $q$ . So, we may assume that all these coordinates differ from

My questions are: Is the purpose of the Einstein tensor to have a linear combination of Ricci Tensor and it being a symmetric tensor so that it has the divergence equal to zero? Or is it for another purpose and the null divergence is just a handy property that has nothing to do with the construction of this tensor?

3260251,Total and partial derivative terminology in scalar- and vector-valued functions of scalars/vectors,"I have the following terminology questions which are often not well addressed in an undergraduate multivariable calculus course. While the questions are long, I expect their answers will be short. As background, say I have two functions that depend on scalar variables $w$ , $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ which each output a scalar or a vector - $f(w, x, y, z)$ and $\boldsymbol{f}(w, x, y, z)$ . I know that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial w}$ , $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ , $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ , and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$ are all called partial derivatives of $f$ and they represent the change in $f$ when varying the variable in the denominator while keeping the others constant. I also know that I can group all 4 independent variables into a vector $\boldsymbol{r} = [w\, x\, y\, z]^T$ such that $f(\boldsymbol{r})$ and $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{r})$ . I can alternatively divide this grouping into several vectors whose dimensions sum to the dimension of $\boldsymbol{r}$ . For example, $f(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q})$ or $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q})$ where $\boldsymbol{p} = [w\, x]^T$ and $\boldsymbol{q} = [y\, z]^T$ . Are $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial w}$ , $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial x}$ , $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial y}$ , and $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial z}$ (which are vectors) all called partial derivatives of $\boldsymbol{f}$ ? Do they similarly represent change in $\boldsymbol{f}$ as a result of varying the variable in the denominator while keeping the others constant? Would $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \boldsymbol{r}}$ (which is a vector and often called $\nabla f$ or $\nabla f^T$ depending on convention) be called the total derivative of $f$ , and therefore would it be correct to use the notation $\frac{df}{d\boldsymbol{r}}$ ? I know this is a vector that points in the direction which most increases the value of $f$ and is not a number like the total derivative would be in single variable calculus. However I recognize that the number you get in single variable calculus is essentially a 1D gradient and plays exactly the same role. Would $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial \boldsymbol{r}}$ (which is a matrix) be called the total derivative of $\boldsymbol{f}$ ? I have heard this called the pushforward, differential, or Jacobian, but is it also correct to think of it as a total derivative and therefore use the notation $\frac{d\boldsymbol{f}}{d\boldsymbol{r}}$ ? I know that this matrix basically contains the gradients of the components of $\boldsymbol f$ , which are scalar functions of $\boldsymbol r$ . Therefore, invoking the idea of the gradient, I might think of this matrix as some transformation which will most increase the magnitude of $\boldsymbol f$ , but given that the gradient of each component could point in arbitrary directions, I would not be able to choose an $\boldsymbol r$ which will align with all of these directions simultaneously. Is there an intuitive gradient-like interpretation of this matrix or should I only think of it as a mapping between small changes in input and output, or a first order approximation of $\boldsymbol{f}$ )? Would $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \boldsymbol{p}}$ , $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}$ (which are vectors) and $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial \boldsymbol{p}}$ , $\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{f}}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}$ (which are matrices) also be called partial derivatives of $f$ and $\boldsymbol f$ ? I assume these describe the change in $f$ and $\boldsymbol f$ due to changes in one independent vector while keeping the other(s) constant.

One method I used would be to imagine that there are $22$ spaces and $2$ slashes that need to go somewhere within these spaces to separate the numbers.  The slashes could go before the string starts, resulting in either all 1's or all 0's depending on which number starts. I'll list some examples of this below. $$//00000 \ldots 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad //1111 \ldots 1 \qquad \text{or} \qquad 11 \ldots /000000/\ldots 1$$ With this method, we have $2$ cases that are the same, its just either picking if 1 or 0 leads. Because of that I'm calculating $2\binom{22}{2}$ .
But like I said, there are issues with this method. For example, when both slashes come before the string, the string that is generated would be the same as if the slashes came after the string.

But I'm wondering if the resolution $I^\bullet$ is unique up to homotopy type just like the injective resolution of a single object. An injective resolution of $A^\bullet$ is a complex $I^\bullet$ consisting of injective objects such that there is a quasi-isomorphism $f:A^\bullet \rightarrow I^\bullet$ . When $A$ is a single object I can think of it as $0\rightarrow A\rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow ...$ and the injective resolution $I^\bullet$ is just the 'usual' injective resolution i.e. $0\rightarrow A \rightarrow I^0\rightarrow I^1 \rightarrow ...$ is exact. In this case I know (e.g. from P. J. Hilton's 'A Course in Homological Algebra', Proposition 4.3) that two injective resolutions $I^\bullet, J^\bullet$ are the same homotopy type (we can find $f:I^\bullet\rightarrow J^\bullet$ and $g:J^\bullet\rightarrow I^\bullet$ such that $fg\simeq 1_I, gf\simeq 1_J$ ). My question is, Is the injective resolution $I^\bullet$ of a bounded-below complex $A^\bullet$ in a category $\mathcal{A}$ with enough injective unique up to homotopy type? How do we show this?

3260577,Using Eisenstein Series to represent the space of lattices - generalization to $\Bbb R^n$,"Suppose $\Lambda$ is a lattice in $\Bbb R^2$ . One way to represent this lattice is as a set of generating vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ . However, this is a non-unique representation, as multiple vectors generate the set. A better way to uniquely represent $\Lambda$ is to instead treat it as a lattice in $\Bbb C$ rather than in $\Bbb R^2$ . We can then uniquely represent the lattice using the two Eisenstein series $G_4$ and $G_6$ : $$
G_{2k}(\Lambda) = \sum_{0 \neq \omega \in \Lambda} \frac{1}{\omega^{2k}}
$$ Since we are now treating the lattice vectors as complex numbers in $\Bbb C$ rather than vectors in $\Bbb R^2$ , the above will converge to a complex number. It is then known that for any lattice $\Lambda$ , the pair $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda))$ then uniquely represents the lattice. That is, we have that the map $$
\text{lattices} \to \Bbb C^2 \\
\Lambda \mapsto (G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda))
$$ is a bijection (including degenerate lattices). There are many descriptions of the above online: The Space of Lattices , Lorenz and modular flows: a visual introduction , n-Category Cafe: The Modular Flow on the Space of Lattices , etc. Serre’s A Course in Arithmetic, p. 89 is often cited. My question is : How can you do something similar for the space of lattices in $\Bbb R^3$ , or $\Bbb R^n$ in general? To get the Eisenstein series, we had to treat $\Bbb R^2$ as an algebra, so that we could take powers of vectors. Is there a different algebra, perhaps a Clifford algebra, that we can use on $\Bbb R^n$ to define a higher-dimensional analogue of the Eisenstein series? The reason I ask is that this representation is very natural. The axis with $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda)) = (1,0)$ represents the square lattice with 4-fold symmetry, and the axis with $(G_4(\Lambda), G_6(\Lambda)) = (0,1)$ represents the triangular lattice with 6-fold symmetry. So, we basically represent the space of lattices as a ""direct sum"" of the spaces of rotated square and triangular lattices. We can easily see that the topology of the unimodular lattices is that of the 3-sphere, except for a trefoil knot representing the degenerate lattices. There are various Seifert fibrations representing modular flow (image) and so on. The thing is that we got all this great structure only because we ""cheated"" and decided that $\Bbb R^2$ was isomorphic to $\Bbb C$ . Phrased another way, all this structure resulted from us placing this nontrivial algebra structure on $\Bbb R^2$ from which we got the Eisenstein series. Doing so, however, gave us a very natural representation of the space of lattices. So it seems there should be a similar representation of the space of lattices in $\Bbb R^n$ .","['algebraic-geometry', 'modular-forms', 'abstract-algebra', 'integer-lattices']"

D_a(f \circ g) = D_{g(a)}(f) \circ D_a(g) \tag{1}

Now for my question: what exactly is $M_1\otimes M_2$ before completion? If $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the collections of the Borel sets of the line, is $M_1\otimes M_2$ the class of Borel set of the plane? My intuition suggest that this is the case, but I can't think of a simple way to prove it. And if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the classes of all Lebesgue measurable subsets of $R$ ?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

3261217,The probability of winning a peculiar dice game,"I'm a high school teacher, and students in my probability class created the following fun conundrum. We've been stuck on it for a couple of weeks: Consider this dice game played with one fair $n$ -sided dice. On the first turn, a roll of $n$ wins, while a roll of $1$ loses. On any other result, the player rolls again. On the 2nd roll, a roll of $n$ wins, while a roll of $1$ or $2$ loses. On any other roll, the game continues. On roll $k$ , the player wins with a roll of $n$ and loses with a roll of $k$ or below. What is the probability of winning as $n \to \infty$ ?. The game must be won in no more than $n - 1$ turns, and for any given $n$ , $$
\mathrm{P}\left(win\right)
=
{1 \over n} +
\sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1}\frac{\left(n - 2\right)!}{\left(n - i - 1\right)!\, n^{i}}

3261812,Zeroes of $\sin(z)-z^2$,"I am studying for my prelims exam. I stumbled upon the following question. Show that there are infinitely many zeroes of $\sin(z)-z^2$ in the complex plane. Had it just been $f(z)=\sin(z)-z$ , one can observe that $f(z+2\pi)=f(z)-2\pi$ . One can, therefore, see that if $f$ takes zeros only finitely often, then $f$ must also take the value $-2\pi$ only finitely often. Picard’s theorem, therefore, tells us that $f$ is a polynomial, which is absurd. This direct approach does not seem to work for my question. So, I tried using Rouche’s theorem. For that I take $g(z)=\sin(z).$ I know the zeroes of $\sin(z)$ , my idea was to find a region containing $n$ zeroes of $sin(z)$ and show that on the boundary we have $$|f-g|<|f|+|g|.$$ I could not choose the suitable region such that the above relation holds on the boundary. I am not sure if it will work or not. Of course, if it works it will prove something stronger, namely, we will in a way have a handle on the location of zeroes. Any hint would be appreciated. Moreover, my guess is that if $p(z)$ is any polynomial then $f(z)=\sin(z)-p(z)$ will have infinitely many zeroes in the complex plane. I would like to see an argument for this case.
