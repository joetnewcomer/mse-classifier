(4 answers) Closed 5 months ago . I want to find $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{n + 1}{n^2 + 1} + \frac{n + 2}{n^2 + 2}  + \cdots + \frac{n + n}{n^2 + n} \right)$$ Here is my solution. $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{n + 1}{n^2 + 1} + \frac{n + 2}{n^2 + 2}  + \cdots + \frac{n + n}{n^2 + n} \right) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{n}{n^2 + 1} + \frac{n}{n^2 + 2}  + \cdots + \frac{n}{n^2 + n} \right) + \left(\frac{1}{n^2 + 1} + \frac{2}{n^2 + 2}  + \cdots + \frac{n}{n^2 + n} \right)$$ Lets call the first sum $S^1_n$ and the second sum $S^2_n$ . Then we have: $$1 \leftarrow n \frac{n}{n^2 + n} \leq S^1_n \leq n \frac{n}{n^2 + 1} \rightarrow 1$$ And by the sandwich criterium $S^1_n \rightarrow 1$ . On the other hand we have: $$ \frac{1}{2} \leftarrow \frac{\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}}{n^2 + n} = \frac{1 + \cdots + n}{n^2 + n} \leq S^2_n \leq \frac{1 + \cdots + n}{n^2 + 1} = \frac{\frac{n (n + 1)}{2}}{n^2 + 1} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$$ So by the sandwich criterium $S^2_n \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ . So the limit is $\frac{3}{2}$ . Is this correct? Are there any other alternatives?,"['solution-verification', 'real-analysis']"
4855502,get dihedral angles of octahedron given all triangles,"An octahedron (not necessarily regular) consists of 8 triangles. You can see it as two pyramids glued together (for now on I only consider this case). Call the triangles in the upper pyramid $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4 $ (clockwise) and in the lower pyramid $T_5, …, T_8$ (clockwise). The seams are $(T_i, T_{i+1}) (i=1,2,3,5,6,7),  (T_4, T_1), (T_8, T_5)$ and $(T_i, T_{i+4})  (i=1,2,3,4)$ . Assume you now all information about the triangles. Call the angles and length for triangle $T_i$ (starting from the top (for $i = 1,...,4$ ), resp. bottom (for $i = 5,6,7,8$ ) and go clockwise): $(a_i, b_i, c_i)$ for lengths and $(\alpha_i,  \beta_i, \gamma_i)$ for the angles. You know that they form an octahedron, the question is know: How can I find all dihedral angles? I guess you can find equations to which these dihedral angles need to fullfill and that by solving these system of equations I can find the dihedral angles.

4855585,Existence of injective and surjective group homomorphisms in both directions implies existence of group isomorphism,"Let $G$ and $H$ be groups such that there exist group homomorphisms $\iota_{HG}: G \hookrightarrow H$ , $\iota_{GH}: H \hookrightarrow G$ , $\pi_{HG}: G \twoheadrightarrow H$ , $\pi_{GH}: H \twoheadrightarrow G$ where $\iota_{HG}$ , $\iota_{GH}$ are injective and $\pi_{HG}$ , $\pi_{GH}$ are surjective. Does it necessarily follow that $G \cong H$ ? Ideas for counterexamples are taken from the following threads: If there are injective homomorphisms between two groups in both directions, are they isomorphic? Does existence of surjective and injective homomorphisms imply isomorphism? $G = F_2 = \langle a, b \rangle$ and $H = F_3 = \langle c, d, e \rangle$ . It is well-known that they are not isomorphic. There is obviously the inclusion $\iota_{HG}(a) = c$ , $\iota_{HG}(b) = d$ . There is also the reverse injection $\iota_{GH}(c) = a^2$ , $\iota_{GH}(d) = ab$ , $\iota_{GH}(e) = b^2$ . We have a projection $\pi_{GH}(c) = a$ , $\pi_{GH}(d) = b$ , $\pi_{GH}(e) = \operatorname{id}$ . However, there cannot be a surjection $\pi_{HG}: G \twoheadrightarrow H$ , otherwise, $F_3$ would be generated by two elements, a contradiction. So this is not a counterexample. $G = A_{\infty}$ the group of even permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ with finite support and $H = S_{\infty}$ the group of all permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ with finite support. It is well-known that these groups are not isomorphic. There is an obvious inclusion $\iota_{HG}$ and it is simple to construct an injection $\iota_{GH}$ that shifts the permutation to the right and then repairs the sign. However, there cannot be a surjection $\pi_{HG}$ . Since $A_{\infty}$ is simple, such a surjection would either have kernel $\{ \operatorname{id} \}$ , in which case it would be injective, meaning $\pi_{HG}$ would be an isomorphism, a contradiction, or it would have kernel $A_{\infty}$ , in which case it would be trivial and not surjective, a contradiction. So this is not a counterexample. $G = \mathbb{R}$ and $H = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{Z}$ . These groups are not isomorphic because $G$ is divisible but $H$ is not divisible. There is an obvious inclusion $\iota_{HG}$ . Because $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ have the same dimension as $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector spaces, they are isomorphic as additive groups. Composing the inclusion of $H$ into $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ with the isomorphism of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ with $G$ , we get an inclusion $\iota_{GH}$ . There is an obvious projection $\pi_{GH}$ . However, there can be no surjection $\pi_{HG}$ , because otherwise $H$ would be a quotient of the divisible group $G$ , meaning that $H$ itself would be disivible, a contradiction. So this is not a counterexample. $G = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} \mathbb{Z}$ and $H = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} \mathbb{Z}$ . These groups are not isomorphic since there is an element of order 2 in $H$ , but not in $G$ . There is an obvious inclusion $\iota_{HG}$ , an obvious projection $\pi_{GH}$ and an obvious projection $\pi_{HG}$ . However, there can be no injection $\iota_{GH}$ , since otherwise $\iota_{GH}(\overline{1}, 0)$ would be of order 2 in $G$ , but all nontrivial elements of $G$ are of infinite order. So this is not a counterexample.","['group-homomorphism', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-isomorphism']"

4855644,Probability of rolling a full house with 5 dice,"I am trying to understand the probability of rolling a full house with 5 dice. I can think of two methods. However, they disagree and I would like to understand why. (1) For method 1, we compute the number of ways to roll a full house (with order mattering), and divide by the number of ordered rolls of 5 dice. This gives $$P =  \frac{6\binom{5}3 5\binom{2}2}{6^5} \approx 0.0386. $$ This is also the accepted answer across multiple sources online. (2) For method 2, we compute the number of possible full house rolls (with order NOT mattering), and divide by the number of rolls of 5 dice, again with order NOT mattering. The former is given by $2\binom{6}2$ . The latter is a case of unordered sampling with replacement. The number of ways to obtain $k$ objects from $n$ in this case is $$ \binom{n + k - 1}{k}. $$ Therefore, overall I would expect the probability of rolling a full house to be $$ P = \frac{2\binom{6}2}{\binom{6 + 5 - 1}5} = 0.119. $$ Why does this disagree with method 1?","['probability-distributions', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

4855710,Sup-additivity of Lebesgue measure for a disjoint union,"In this answer of mine , I used the obviously false statement that the Lebesgue measure is additive, while it is indeed only countably additive.
But one could fix the argument if the following statement were true: Let $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ be pairwise disjoint measurable subsets of $\Bbb R$ , where $I$ is any set.
Then $\sum_{i\in I} \lambda(A_i) \leqslant \lambda (\cup_{i\in I} A_i)$ . However, I do not even know if that statement is true, no matter how reasonable it looks like.
Is there any obvious counter-example? Obviously, if the subsets $\{A_i\}$ are assumed open, which is the case in the linked answer, the equality holds, since any open subset of the real line has at most countably many connected components.
Nonetheless, this latter fact is in some sense what was asked to prove, with the constraint that one should not refer to the density and the countability of rationals.
That is why here the statement refers to general subsets and not open subsets.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

4855713,Uniqueness of multiplication in a ring,"Can we show that the equality $$∀A,B∈R:\ \ A*B=A\mathcal{J}^{-1}B$$ necessarily follows, given a ring $R$ with addition $(+)$ , multiplication $(·)$ with respect to the identity $\mathcal{I}$ and another multiplication $(∗)$ with respect to the identity $\mathcal{J}≠\mathcal{I}$ ? It is implied that $\mathcal{J}$ has an inverse with respect to $(·)$ : $$∃!\mathcal{J}^{-1}∈R:\ \ \mathcal{J}^{-1}\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{I}$$ I'm working on a set on which I'm trying to define a ""multiplication"" with respect to the ""addition"" that already exists. There seems to be quite a few ways to do this but I noticed that all those that I know of can be reduced to any single one of them by the formula I gave at the beginning, thus making them all ""equivalent"" in a sense. I suspect that this is an abstarct-algebraic property induced by my set being a ring rather than by its specific structure. It is easy to show that, given a multiplication $(·)$ with unity $\mathcal{I}$ and an invertible element $\mathcal{J}$ , the formula $A*B=A\mathcal{J}^{-1}B$ does indeed define another multiplication $(∗)$ with unity $\mathcal{J}$ (checking the axioms is straighforward); but so far I've struggled to prove the converse, mostly because the two multiplications don't seem to interact with each other at all. I don't even know whether this is in fact true but couldn't construct counterexamples in the more familiar rings either. P.S. My algebraic structure of interest is also commutative with respect to $(·)$ so it's ok if the proof has to rely on that (but not all elements it contains are invertible, I would have called it a field otherwise; neither do I know anything about zero divisors in it).

We can provide a smooth example using the same argument and bump function. However $f(t)$ is not analytic. Since the proof relies that $f(t)$ is constant function in open interval. I wonder if $f(t)$ being analytic is enough. Is true the following statement? Let $f(t):[0,\infty] \to [-1,1]$ be an analytic function.

We first isolate triangle $\triangle BEG$ to get a triangle where $BF:EF=3:2$ and $BD:DG=2:3$ and project this triangle onto a cartesian plane with $EG$ as the base. Then let each of the points be given by the coordinates $E=(0,0)$ , $G=(c,0)$ , $B=(a,b)$ . Then it follows that $D=(a+\frac{2}{5}(c-a), \frac{3}{5}b)$ and $F=(\frac{2}{5}a,\frac{2}{5}b)$ . The line passing through the points $E,D$ is then given by $$y=\frac{\frac{3}{5}b}{a+\frac{2}{5}(c-a)}x=\frac{3b}{3a+2c}x$$ and the line going through the points $F,G$ is $$y=\frac{\frac{-2}{5}b}{c-\frac{2}{5}a}(x-c)=\frac{-2b}{5c-2a}(x-c)$$ From there it's just a matter of finding their points of intersection and determine each length and their ratio however this is very tedious and long.

sequence of $0$ s and $1$ s) obtained by starting with $0$ and
successively appending the Boolean complement of the sequence obtained

prefixes of the Thue–Morse sequence. The full sequence begins: $01101001100101101001011001101001....$ For each $n\in\mathbb{N},$ let $X_n$ be the (string of) first $n$ digits of the Thue-Morse sequence. Does $\ \exists\ n\ $ such that the (string of) first $2n$ digits of T-M is the
concatenated sequence/string $X_n X_n\ ?$ If yes, then obviously by definition of T-M, $n\neq 2^k,\ k\in\mathbb{N}$ . I also know that the T-M sequence contains no cubes, i.e. concatenated contiguous subsequences of the form $XXX.$ Other than this observation, I don't see how to make progress on the problem.

The problem goes something like this: Let $\varepsilon$ be some infinitesimal, such that it is smaller than
any positive real number but still larger than zero. Is it possible to evaluate $\sin
 \varepsilon$ or express it in terms of elementary functions (except for the trigonometric functions)? This is rather non-trivial. The intuitive answer would simply be that $\sin \varepsilon$ = $\varepsilon$ . But in reality, this is an approximation and depending on the context, that approximation has to be made better. One could of course try to define it using a Taylor expansion: $\displaystyle \sin \varepsilon=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(\varepsilon)^{2n+1}\cdot(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}$ But this is quite unsatisfying, since we haven't really solved the issue, just expressed it differently.

Will it enclose a four-dimensional region, similar to how the three-dimenaional torus $T^2 \subseteq \mathbb R^3$ partitions three-dimensional space $\mathbb R^3$ into an inside and an outside? In the case of the three-dimensional torus embedded into three-dimensional space, three-dimensional droplets cannot ""fill"" the inside from the outside without intersecting with the torus itself (there is no path for a ball which does not also lead to crossing the torus). Or will it be analogous to the Möbius band, which doesn't enclose an inside? ""Filling"" a Möbius strip with water doesn't really make sense since it's just a surface and doesn't enclose any three-dimensional volume. What throws me off is that it seems unreasonable to think that a surface can enclose a  four-dimensional volume, since analogously a curve in three dimensional space cannot enclose a three-dimensional volume.

Here: we take $K = \mathcal N \subseteq \mathcal M = \mathbb R^4$ . Even if it is path-connnected, can a hyperraindroplet freely pass through $\mathcal M\setminus \mathcal N$ ?

My thoughts: Well, we know that each partial order is defined on some one set, in which a certain number of elements. It turns out that these orders will consist of the same elements, but their partial order relations are different. Therefore, at the intersection of these orders, we will get a new order in which the number of elements is the same as that of the original orders, but in this order it turns out that two partial order relations are fulfilled at once?

4856206,Oddity in definition(s) of quasi compact operator,"I was wondering about the general definition of a quasicompact operator. There seem to be two main ones floating around in the literature, and I am not sure they are equivalent. The first, and seemingly most prevalent one is that an operator $T:B \to B$ is quasi-compact, if there exists a natural number $n$ , and a compact operator $K$ , so that $$
\|T^n-K\|<1
$$ The second definition says that $T$ is quasi-compact, if there exists two closed, invariant subspaces $F, H$ , so that $$
B=F\oplus H
$$ with $dim(F) <\infty$ , so that the spectral radius of $T$ restricted to $H$ is strictly less than the spectral radius of $T$ , $r(T)$ , and any eigenvalue of $T$ restricted to $F$ has magnitude $r(T)$ . My main query is that, whilst these definitions seem to be equivalent in the special case when $r(T) = 1$ , the second definition seems to imply that the class of quasi-compact operators is stable under scalar multiplication, whilst the first does not. I believe I came up with an example which I will put at the end of the question. A seemingly simple fix would be to require that $\|T^n-K\| < r(T)^n$ , but I haven't seen it used anywhere.
I guess since these operators mainly show up in ergodic theory, having unit norm is very natural, and so perhaps this is how the convention was born. Nevertheless, having read quite a few papers now which use definition 1 in the form I stated, I was still wondering if perhaps I had perhaps missed something. $\textbf{Example:}$ Let $B$ be a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis $e_i$ . Define now an operator $T:B \to B$ by $Te_i=e_i$ for $i >1$ , and $Te_1=2e_1$ . This operator is quasi-compact in the sense of definition 2 (take $F=span\{e_1\}$ , $H=\overline{span\{e_i:i\geq 2\}}$ ), but not the sense of definition 1. However, $\frac{T}{\|T\|}$ is again quasi-compact in the sense of definition 1. To see $T$ is not quasicompact in the sense of definition 1,  note that $T^n$ still agrees with $T$ on any $e_i$ with $i \geq 2$ . Thus, if $K$ is compact and $\|T^n-K\|<1$ , there must exists a constant $a>0$ so that for all $i \geq 2$ , it holds $$
|1-\langle e_i,Ke_i\rangle|\leq \|T^ne_i-Ke_i\|\leq 1-a
$$ so that $a \leq |\langle e_i,Ke_i\rangle|$ . By the compactness assumption, since the sequence $\{e_i\}$ converges weakly to zero, $Ke_i$ must converge to zero in norm. But then $\|Ke_i\|\geq a$ for any $i \geq 2$ , so this cannot be.","['probability-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

there are mutually disjoint intervals $I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots$ and real numbers $y_1 > y_2 > \ldots$ such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ , $$f(a(x+1)) - f(ax) \in I_x \subseteq [y_{x+1}, y_x] \quad \text{for all $a \in \mathbb{R}^+$}.$$ Note that since $I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots$ are mutually disjoint, if $y_{x+1} \in I_x$ then $y_{x+1} \not\in I_{x+1}$ and vice versa. One function satisfying this property is $\log$ : for any fixed $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ , $\log(a(x+1)) - \log(ax) = \log\left(\frac{a(x+1)}{ax}\right) = \log\left(\frac{x+1}{x}\right)$ is constant, and furthermore, $\log\left(\frac{x}{x-1}\right) > \log\left(\frac{x+1}{x}\right)$ . My question is this: Is there any other function satisfying this property other than functions of the form $f(x) = a \log x + b$ ? My suspicion is that the answer is no, but I don't know how to prove it. I will explain my idea so far: Note that the above condition requires $f$ to be strictly increasing. Hence, $y_0 > y_1 > \ldots > 0$ and so the intervals $I_i$ will eventually get very small, i.e. $y_i - y_{i-1} \rightarrow 0$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$ . On the other hand, let $g_x(a) = f(a(x+1)) - f(ax)$ for $a \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ . If there exists some $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ , such that $g_x$ is not constant, then $I_x$ must contain more than one point, i.e. $\sup I_x - \inf I_x > 0$ . Based on my observations on some functions, it seems that the intervals $I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots$ do not get smaller fast enough, so that there will eventually be overlap between $I_x$ and $I_{x+1}$ for large enough $x$ . (One function that I tested is $f(x) = \log x + \varepsilon \sin x$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small number like $\varepsilon = 0.01$ .) However, I haven't been able to prove this observation. I did find some relationship between $g_x$ and $g_{x+1}$ but it's not a strong enough relationship: $$g_{x+1}(a) - g_{x+1}\left(\frac{x-1}{x} \cdot a\right) = g_x\left(\frac{x+1}{x} \cdot a\right) - g_x(a).$$ So, is my suspicion true that the only functions satisfying the above property have the form $f(x) = a\log x + b$ ? If yes, how can I prove this? If not, what other function satisfies this property?","['functional-inequalities', 'logarithms', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Let $I = \langle f_1, \dotsc, f_n \rangle$ . [O]ne can show that most small perturbations of $f_1, \dotsc, f_n$ result in a system of equations with distinct zeroes, each of which has multiplicity one, and that the number of such zeroes is precisely equal to the multiplicity of the origin as a solution of $f_1 = \dotsb = f_n = 0$ . Moreover, the ring $k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]/I$ turns out to be a limit, in a rather precise sense, of the set of functions on these distinct zeroes. I'm interested in any sources that discuss how to define precisely how $k[x_1, \dotsc, x_n]/I$ is a limit in the above sense, but unfortunately, the text doesn't mention any additional sources. More broadly, I'm interested in any relatively modern treatments of a dynamic definition for intersection multiplicity, which is also alluded to in this answer . Unsurprisingly, the static definition (in terms of the dimension of a local ring) is much cleaner, so all the sources I've seen take that as the definition, and maybe mention that it's related to how perturbing the curves around an intersection point of multiplicity $m > 1$ will result in $m$ points of multiplicity $1$ , but no one bothers to explain it precisely. There are also some historical sources, explaining how there used to be a principle called ""conservation of number"" which describes the above, but that comes from the old Italian school of algebraic geometry, and those sources are probably too unrigorous to be useful.

4856484,Lower bound on sample size to determine coin fairness,"This is a conclusion I came to through very basic knowledge of statistics and error analysis. Suppose we want to determine the fairness of a coin. To do this, we need to determine the probability of the coin landing on either Heads or Tails and we do this through repeated flipping. We have an amount of uncertainty we are willing to allow in our measurement of the probability. We define the variable $f$ as follows: $$f = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if the coin lands on Heads} \\
0, & \text{if the coin lands on Tails}
\end{cases}$$ Then our measurement of the probability $P(H)$ of the coin landing on heads is equal to the sample average of $f$ , $\bar f$ . The formula for the standard error of the measurement of $f$ through $n$ samples is: $$\Delta f = \frac{\sigma_f}{\sqrt{n}}$$ Now, since $f$ can only have values $0$ and $1$ , its standard deviation cannot be greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ . So we have: $$\Delta f < \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$$ So if we flip the coin $n$ times, we can be pretty confident our error in estimating the probability is at most $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$ . Rearranging: $$n<\frac{1}{4(\Delta f)^2}$$ So to measure the probability with an error of $\Delta f$ we can be pretty confident we'll need to flip the coin $\frac{1}{4(\Delta f)^2}$ times at most.
Then for example, if I want to determine the probability of the coin landing of Heads within an error of 5%, I'll need to flip it at most 100 times. Is this reasoning correct?","['standard-error', 'statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'probability']"

4856818,Balanced Snowball Sampling,"There is a method in qualitative research called ""balanced snowball sampling"", which runs as follows. Say the interviews are assessing perspectives on some issue, each interviewee is asked to recommend two further interviewees, one who will offer a more positive perspective, and one who will offer a more negative perspective than their own. In a simple model of this we are sampling some continuous distribution $p(x)$ . However, we are not allows to sample $p(x)$ directly: instead we start from some arbitrary initial sample of a single point (not necessarily drawn from $p(x)$ , but necessarily within its support), and the only allowed mechanism for growing the sample size is take some point $x_i$ in our sample, and generate two additional points $x_j^>$ and $x_j^<$ drawn randomly from $p(x|x>x_i)$ and $p(x|x<x_i)$ respectively. Interestingly, if you apply this method recursively (generating two points from every point in your sample, and two points from each of those points, and so on), the sample distribution does converge, but not to $p(x)$ . Instead, the sample distribution over represents tail events. I have two questions: What distribution does the sample converge to? Is there a straightforward way of including a rejection (discarding
certain points from the sample) which means that the sample does
converge to $p(x)$ ?","['statistics', 'sampling']"

4856912,Is the monster group maximal in SO(196883)?,"The smallest degree of a nontrivial complex representation of the monster group $ M $ is $ 196883 $ . This irrep has Schur indicator $ 1 $ , so the image must lie in the orthogonal group. In fact, since $  M $ is perfect the image must lie in the special orthogonal group. Thus $ M $ is a subgroup of the Lie group $ SO(196883) $ . Is $ M $ maximal among the closed subgroups of $ SO(196883) $ ? To give a very small example of why I think this might be true consider the simple group $ A_5 $ . The smallest degree of a nontrivial complex representation of $ A_5 $ is $ 3 $ . And the degree 3 irrep of $ A_5 $ has Schur indicator $ 1 $ . So, for the same reasons described above, $ A_5 $ must be a subgroup of the Lie group $ SO(3) $ . And it turns out that $ A_5 $ is maximal among the closed subgroups of $ SO(3) $ . This seems interesting to me since $ SO(3)/A_5 $ is the famous Poincare homology sphere.

4857130,A walk on a $2D$ Poisson process in which every step goes to the nearest unvisited point: expected distance from origin after $365$ steps?,"Uncle's epic journey One year ago, my uncle set off from our village on an epic journey, in which every day he travels to the nearest unvisited village and stays there for the night. The villages in our country are randomly located (independently and uniformly) with an average of $1$ village per square mile. Our village is in the middle of a very large country, such that my uncle could not possibly reach the border within one year. Here is an example of what the first two weeks of his journey could look like. I haven't heard from my uncle since he left, and I don't have a map. How far away do you reckon he is now? That is, What is the expectation of his distance (as the crow flies) from our village? My attempt I have only been able to get a crude approximation, $\frac14\sqrt{365\pi}\approx8.47$ miles, by making the following two assumptions. Assume his journey is effectively just like a $2D$ random walk with constant step size $\lambda$ , where $\lambda$ is defined as the expected step size of his actual journey. Assume $\lambda=$ expected nearest neighbor distance in a $2D$ Poisson process with intensity $1$ . Under the second assumption, $\lambda=\frac12$ . Proof: If $X$ is the distance to a village's nearest neighbor, then the density function is $f(x)=2\pi xe^{-\pi x^2}$ , so $\mathbb{E}(X)=\int_0^\infty xf(x)\mathrm dx=\frac12$ . Then under the first assumption, my uncle's expected distance from our village is $\frac{\lambda}{2}\sqrt{365\pi}\approx8.47$ . I suspect the first assumption causes an underestimate: my uncle never revisits a village, so his path involves less ""back-tracking"" than a $2D$ random walk. The second assumption definitely causes an underestimate, because usually my uncle's step size is greater than the nearest neighbor distance. So I suspect the correct answer is considerably larger than $8.47$ .

And if we consider only $u$ of small height (numerator and denominator with absolute value less than $1000$ ), then only $16 $ $u$ are known. Q: How do we find more $u$ of small height? (The context of this curve is given below.) II. Background Noam Elkies found the first counterexample to Euler's conjecture that $x^4+y^4+z^4 = 1$ has no rational point $xyz \neq0$ . We provide a slightly different method that produces pairs of solutions. Let, $$x^4+y^4+z^4 = 1\tag1$$ $$\frac{(x-y)^2-z^2-1}{x^2-xy+y^2+(x-y)}=u\tag2$$ $$\frac{(y-z)^2-x^2-1}{y^2-yz+z^2+(y-z)}=v\tag3$$ $$\frac{(z-x)^2-y^2-1}{z^2-zx+x^2+(z-x)}=w\tag4$$ where the $(u,v,w)$ have the simple relationship, $$2(u+v+w)-uvw-4=0$$ Use the first three equations to solve for the three unknowns $(x,y,z)$ to get, \begin{align}
x &= \frac{P_1\pm(u^2-2u+2)(v^2-2v)\sqrt{D^2}}{P_0+D^2}\\
y &= \frac{-(P_1+P_2+P_3)\pm 2(u+v-2)(u+v-uv)\sqrt{D^2}}{P_0+D^2 \quad}\\
z &= \frac{P_3\pm(v^2-2v+2)(u^2-2u)\sqrt{D^2}}{P_0+D^2}
\end{align} with $D$ as defined in the first section. The $P_k$ are, \begin{align}
P_0 &= (2 + u^2)(2 + v^2)(12 - 8u + 2u^2 - 8v + 2v^2 + u^2v^2)\\ 
P_1 &= (-4 + 4u + 2v - u^2v)(8u - 4u^2 + 4v - 8 u v + 2u^2v - 4v^2 + 2v^3 + u^2v^3)\\ 
P_2 &= 2(- 4 + 4u + 2v - u^2v)(4 - 2u - 4v + u v^2)(-u + v)\\ 
P_3 &= (4 - 2u - 4v + u v^2)(4u - 4u^2 + 2u^3 + 8v - 8 u v - 4v^2 + 2 u v^2 + u^3v^2)\end{align} For example, let $u = -\frac{9}{20}$ , then, $$D^2 = \frac{-9724476 - 9928v + 6396480v^2 - 6677284v^3 + 1280881v^4}{20^4}$$ One solution is $v = -\frac{1041}{320}$ , or $v = \frac{1000}{47}$ . Using the positive and negative cases of $\pm \sqrt{D^2}$ , either $v$ yields, $$\left(\frac{414560}{422481}\right)^4 + \left(\frac{95800}{422481}\right)^4 + \left(\frac{217519}{422481}\right)^4 = 1$$ $$\left(\frac{632671960}{1679142729}\right)^4 + \left(\frac{1670617271}{1679142729}\right)^4 + \left(\frac{50237800}{1679142729}\right)^4 = 1$$ From this initial point $v$ , one can then find infinitely more $v_k$ .

4857239,Stokes' theorem in differential geometry vs measure theory [closed],"Closed . This question is opinion-based . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 5 months ago . Improve this question For some context, I'm an undergraduate student in mathematics and have attended an introductory measure theory lecture. The lecture seemed to loosely follow some chapters of Real Analysis (Folland, 1999, 2nd edition) in scope if not in depth. In the next semester, I'll take what is called Analysis 3 in our curriculum. Now I've been comparing different lecture notes and there seem to be two different approaches to Stokes' theorem (as a widely applied theorem, I chose this especially for a cursory comparison). The one we will be learning is the differential geometry approach: Theorem (Stokes, 3.13, Analysis 3, Cap, 2023 ): Let $M \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a $k$ -dimensional oriented $C^1$ -submanifold with boundary $\partial M$ and let $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open with $M \subset W$ . Then for every continuously differentiable $(k-1)$ -form $\tau \in \Omega^{k-1}(W)$ with compact support on $M$ and with the induced orientation on $\partial M$ we have $$ \int_M d\tau = \int_{\partial M} \tau.$$ Other lecturers seem to prefer the measure theoretical approach: Theorem (Stokes, 15.9.2, Aufbau Analysis, Kaltenbäck, 2021 ): Let $p \gt 1$ and $G \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ be open and bounded. Let $f: \mathscr{cl}(G) \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous such that $f{\big|}_G$ is continuously differentiable. Let $L \subset \partial G \setminus \partial^o G$ such that $$ \lim_{\delta \searrow 0} \frac{\lambda_p(K_{\delta}(L))}{\delta} = 0$$ and the support of $f$ be a subset of $G \cup \partial^o G \cup L.$ Then if $\partial_j f \in \mathscr{L}(G, \lambda_p)$ for all $j \in \{ 1, \dots, p \}$ and $f\big|_{\partial^o G} \in \mathscr{L}(\partial^o G, \mu)$ with the surface measure $\mu$ we have $$ \int_G D f(x) w \, d\lambda_p(x) = \int_{\partial^o G} f(y) \cdot \left(v(y)^T w\right) \, d\mu(y) $$ for any $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ with the outward normal vector $v(y)$ at $y \in \partial^o G$ . What I've been wondering is how the two approaches differ in the long run and where it all leads to.

c\left(x-r_1\right) \cdots\left(x-r_n\right)
$$ where $c, r_1, \ldots, r_n$ are complex numbers.
The $n$ complex numbers $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ are the roots of the polynomial. If a root appears in several factors, it is a multiple root, and the number of its occurrences is, by definition, the multiplicity of the root.
The proof that this statement results from the previous ones is done by recursion on $n$ : when a root $r_1$ has been found, the polynol division by $x-r_1$ provides a polynomial of degree $n-1$ whose roots are the other roots of the given polynomial. If n=1, then the answer is at most two. If n=2 the answer is at most four if I'm assuming true you can write y=(x-3)(x-2)(x+3)(x-4) some how such that the cubic and linear term cancels out and you're only left with even exponents. If n=k, the answer is at most 2k, and at least zero assuming all the odd exponents greater than or equal to three leaving cancel out but the linear term $bx^n$ and the c are kept, but I don't know if they do for real roots.","['algebra-precalculus', 'abstract-algebra', 'roots', 'polynomials']"
4857451,Non-isomorphisms of orders,"Task: Let A = $\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} : x ⩾ y \}$ and
B = $\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} : x ⩽ y\}$ . Consider the restriction
of the lexicographic order $\mathbb{N} \times_{lex} \mathbb{N}$ on these sets: a pair $(x_{1} , y_{1})$ is less than a pair $(x_{2} , y_{2} )$ if $x_{1} < x_{2}$ or $x_{1} = x_{2}$ and $y_{1} < y_{2}$ . Are these orders isomorphic on sets A and B? My thinking: Usually, when proving an isomorphism, it is enough to give a bijection $f$ , which works as follows: $(x_{1}, y_{1}) < (x_{2}, y_{2}) \Rightarrow f((x_{1}, y_{1})) < f((x_{2}, y_{2}))$ . No matter how much I try to bring such a bijection, I come to the conclusion that when constructing it, the condition $(x_{1}, y_{1}) < (x_{2}, y_{2}) \Rightarrow f((x_{1}, y_{1})) < f((x_{2}, y_{2}))$ is violated. It turns out that it is necessary to prove that these orders are not isomorphic.
It seems impossible to prove that such a bijection does not exist, since both sets A and B are infinite, therefore there can also be an infinite number of bijections, at least it seems to me an irrational approach to solving this task. (if this is incorrect, then point out my mistake to me). Usually non-isomorphisms are proved as follows: the minimum/maximum/smallest/largest elements from one order do not pass into the minimum/maximum/smallest/largest elements of another order each segment of power $[x, y]$ does not pass into the segment $[f(x), f(y)]$ which has the same power limit elements they do not pass into limit elements of a different order I'm not quite able to figure out how to use this to prove non-isomorphism.

\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{\pi} e^{-x e^{-j\pi\sin(\theta)}} d\theta,

My goal is to understand this integral's behavior, particularly in terms of its real and imaginary parts, and to find a theoretical solution or express it in terms of well-known functions or integrals. Previous Attempts: Imaginary Part Analysis: Through symmetry arguments and considering the periodic and symmetric properties of the sine and cosine functions, we established that the imaginary part of the integral is zero across the domain of (x). Real Part Behavior: By analyzing the first and second derivatives of the function inside the integral with respect to (x), we proved that the real part of the integral is increasing and monotonic, as well as convex, with respect to (x). Simplification Attempt: We considered simplifying the real part of the integral, focusing on: $$
\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{\pi} e^{-x \cos(\pi\sin(\theta))} d\theta.
$$ This led to a discussion on whether this form has similarities with the modified Bessel function of the first kind, ( $I_0(x)$ ), given its resemblance to integrals related to Bessel functions. However, the unique composition involving ( $\cos(\pi\sin(\theta))$ ) does not straightforwardly match the standard form or known variations of ( $I_0(x)$ ). Questions: Is there a closed-form expression for this integral, or can it be expressed in terms of well-known functions or integrals? Given the properties we've established (imaginary part being zero, monotonicity, and convexity of the real part), are there any theoretical tools or approaches that could simplify the analysis or provide a direct solution? I appreciate any insights or references to similar integrals or techniques that could aid in solving or approximating this integral in a more theoretical framework.

4857527,the infinite series $\sum z^n$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ does not converge uniformly on $|z| <1$,"The series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n$ does not converge uniformly on $D(0,1) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z|<1 \}$ .
Here is my attempt: Suppose to the contrary that the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n$ converges uniformly on $D(0,1)$ .
Since uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, the series converges to \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n = \frac{1}{1-z}
\end{equation*} for all $z \in D(0, 1)$ .
Choose $z = 1 - \frac{1}{k}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $z \in D(0, 1)$ .
Then, we have \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k}\right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{k}\right)} = k.
\end{equation*} However, the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k}\right)^n$ diverges as $k \to \infty$ .
This is a contradiction. Now I know that I have to use the supremum norm, but why the attempt does not work? Although the sequence converges to $1$ , I thought that it still lives in $D(0,1)$ . Edit: I changed the summation from $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$ to $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)^n$ .","['complex-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series']"
