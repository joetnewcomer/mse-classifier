13257,"Solving a ""logistic-like"" function with two unknowns, two data points","I am stuck in trying to solve the following: Given two points $(x_{1}; y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}; y_{2})$, to determine the parameters $a$ and $b$ in the equation: $$y=\frac{e^{a+bx} - e^{a}}{1+e^{a+bx}}.$$ In other words, I have two unknowns and two set of points, so there's for sure a solution, but how can the following system of equation be rewritten explicitly on $a$ and $b$? $$\left\{\begin{matrix}
y_{1}&=\frac{e^{a+bx_{1}} - e^{a}}{1+e^{a+bx_{1}}}\\ 
y_{2}&=\frac{e^{a+bx_{2}} - e^{a}}{1+e^{a+bx_{2}}}

13282,Determining whether a symmetric matrix is positive-definite (algorithm),"I'm trying to create a program, that will decompose a matrix using the Cholesky decomposition. The decomposition itself isn't a difficult algorithm, but a matrix, to be eligible for Cholesky decomposition, must be symmetric and positive-definite. Checking whether a matrix is symmetric is easy, but the positive part proves to be more complex. I've read about the Sylvester's criterion, but that leads to determinants, and based on what I found on the web, those are quite extensive and hard on computers. In a nutshell - is there something I might be missing? Due to the fact the the matrix is square or something like that, is there possibly a simpler way to determine whether it's positive? Regards,

13421,application of strong vs weak law of large numbers,"By definition, the weak law states that for a specified large $n$, the average  is likely to be near $\mu$. Thus, it leaves open the possibility that $|\bar{X_n}-\mu| \gt \eta$ happens an infinite number of times, although at infrequent intervals. The strong law shows that this almost surely will not occur. In particular, it implies that with probability 1, we have that for any $\eta > 0$ the inequality $|\bar{X_n}-\mu| \lt \eta$ holds for all large enough $n$. Now my question is application of these laws. How do I know which distribution satisfies the strong law vs the weak law. For example, consider a distribution $X_n$ be iid with finite variances and zero means. Does the mean $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_k}{n}$ converge to $0$ almost surely (strong law of large numbers) or only in probability (weak law of large numbers)?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"

I borrowed a book from my friends physics professor, I think it was called Comparison theorems in Riemannian Geometry by Cheeger and Ebin, and the content was foreign to me.

So my question is - how can we prove this claim? (That an orthonormal set in an infinite dimension vector space is not a vector space basis). Edit (by Jonas Meyer): Knapp says in a footnote on page 92 of Basic algebra : In the infinite-dimensional theory the term ""orthonormal basis"" is used for an orthonormal set that spans $V$ when limits of finite sums are allowed, in addition to finite sums themselves; when $V$ is infinite-dimensional, an orthonormal basis is never large enough to be a vector-space basis.

13861,Best fit ellipsoid,"Given a collection of points $P \subset \mathbb R^3$, a crude characterization of the ""shape"" of $P$ is sometimes given by the principal components. We construct a covariance matrix, e.g., if $P$ is discrete, $C = \displaystyle\sum_{p\in P} (p - \mu)(p - \mu)^\intercal$, where $\mu = \displaystyle\frac1{|P|}\sum_{p\in P}\, p$ is the centre of mass. This defines an ellipsoid whose semi-axis are defined by the unit eigenvectors of $C$, scaled by the associated eigenvalues. My question is concerned with the following statement: The ellipsoid described by the principal components is the best fit
  ellipsoid for $P$. Unfortunately, I don't know of any author or resource that I can accuse of explicitly making such a claim$^*$.  Anyway, my question is: Is there a natural geometric definition of ""best fit ellipsoid"" for
  which the above statement becomes true? For example, some kind of least squares or other variational characterization of this same ellipsoid is what I am looking for. I would also accept an answer that convinces me that this is the wrong way to be looking at the principal components, but that will be a tough sell. If we do a coordinate translation, so that $v_p = (p - \mu)$, and let
$\hat{v}_p = \frac{v_p}{\left\|v_p\right\|}$, and look at $C$ as a
linear transformation which is the sum of the rank one operators in
this coordinate system, $C = \displaystyle\sum_{p \in P} \left\|v_p\right\|^2
\hat{v}_p\hat{v}_p^\intercal$, then the ellipsoid in question is the
image of the unit ball. From this characterization I gain some
intuition as to why this particular ellipsoid is a good one. I am
looking for a better understanding, preferably from a geometric perspective. * Wikipedia comes close to such a claim in the description of the moments : ""The 'second moment', ... in higher dimensions measures the shape of a cloud of points as it could be fit by an ellipsoid."" Edit: Although I feel that the observation that the ellipsoid reflects the variance of the  Gaussian distribution that has maximal likelihood to produce $P$ (I haven't rolled up my sleeves and checked), this is not the kind of answer I am looking for. Perhaps I should remove all tags that refer to probability or regression. I will make the question very specific then. From stuff I've seen elsewhere on the web, I get the feeling that this ellipsoid is different from the one that minimizes the sum of squared distances to the points, but I don't know for sure. How about this then: the radial distance from a point $p$ to the ellipsoid is the distance as measured along the line that contains $p$ and $\mu$ (the latter being the origin in our new coordinate system).

$$ = \frac1{24} \times \biggl( \frac1{2n-1} + \frac3{2n+1} - \frac4{2n+2} \biggr)$$ $$ = \frac1{24} \times \biggl[\biggl( \frac1{2n-1} + \frac1{2n+1}\biggr) + 4 \times \biggl(\frac1{2n+1} - \frac1{2n+2} \biggr) \biggr]$$ After this this becomes really easy,
  $$ S_\infty =   \frac1{24} \times \biggl[( 1 - \frac13 + \frac13 -  \frac15 +  \frac15 + \cdots ) + 4 \times (\ln 2 - \frac12)\biggr]$$ $$ = \frac16 \log_e 2 - \frac1{24}$$ But as you can see this approach is a bit tedious and it took me some 30 minutes to reduce the $T_n$ to that form.

13889,Motivating Cohomology,"Question: Are there intuitive ways to introduce cohomology?  Pretend you're talking to a high school student; how could we use pictures and easy (even trivial!) examples to illustrate cohomology? Why do I care: For a number of math kids I know, doing algebraic topology is fine until we get to homology, and then it begins to get a bit hazy: why does all this quotienting out work, why do we make spaces up from other spaces, how do we define attaching maps, etc, etc.  I try to help my peers do basic homological calculations through a sequence of easy examples (much like the ones Hatcher begins with: taking a circle and showing how ""filling it in"" with a disk will make the ""hole"" disappear --- ) and then begin talking about what kinds of axioms would be nice to have in a theory like this.  I have attempted to begin studying co-homology through ""From Calculus to Cohomology"" and Hatcher's text, but I cannot see the ""picture"" or imagine easy examples of cohomology to start with.","['general-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology']"

Can we find some $C \leq A$, $D \leq B$ such that $H \cong C \times D$? In case the statement is not true: is it true under further assumptions about A and B, such as solvability, nilpotency, etc? Special cases I can prove: $A$ and $B$ are abelian (following ideas from another discussion: $G$ finite abelian. $A \times B$ embedded in $G$. Is $G=C \times D$ such that $A$ embedded in $C$, $B$ embedded in $D$? ) $(|A|,|B|)=1$. In this case we even have $H = C \times D$.

13898,How to prove that the derivative of Heaviside's unit step function is the Dirac delta?,"Here is a problem from Griffith's book Introduction to E&M . Let $\theta(x)$ be the step function $$\theta(x) = \begin{cases}
0, & x \le 0, \\
1, & x \gt 0. 
\end{cases}
$$ The question is how to prove $\frac{d\theta}{dx} = \delta(x)$ . I think since the function is discontinuous at $x = 0$ , there is no definition of $\frac{d\theta}{dx}$ at the point $x = 0$ at all. Thus, how could we show the equivalence of a equation if the left part of equation is not defined at the point $x = 0$ ?","['distribution-theory', 'real-analysis']"

If it is possible to place a hypercylinder B of radius and height c .l each, such that the axis of B is a subedge of e and B ∩ (E − e)= φ, then e is said to be isolated. If all the edges in E are isolated, then E is said to satisfy the isolation property.

13902,Does a Fourier transformation on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold make sense?,"the Fourier transformation of a scalar function with respect to one variable might be defined as $\mathcal{F}\left[w\right](\omega )\equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w(t)e^{-\mathrm{i}\omega t}dt$ In physics, this transformation along with its generalization, the Laplace transformation, has a tremendous importance because of its feature to turn linear partial differential equations into algebraic ones. Now, suppose that we have a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ where $\det{g_{\mu\nu}} = -1$ holds like in special and general relativity. I am wondering, what would be the generalization of the Fourier transformation of scalar functions or forms? The difficulty I have with this question is that a three-dimensional slicing of $\mathcal{M}$ is not unique, so how to take the integral in an invariant form? What will happen to the differntials $dx^{\mu}$, e.g. $dt,dx^i\rightarrow d\omega dx^i$ in some sense? Any insight would be well appreciated.

13912,Intuition in algebra?,"My algebra background: I've had 2 undergrad semesters of algebra, a reading course in Galois Theory, a graduate course in commutative algebra and one in algebraic geometry, and I've done (most of) MacLane and Birkhoff's Algebra on my own. The problem is that I feel like I still don't have any idea how to do algebra. I do well in my classes and don't have any problem with most exercises in M&B I do. But my process consists pretty much entirely of fiddling around with symbols until I figure out how to apply theorems I know in a completely straightforward way. I'm able to do exercises from a book, but rarely able to prove theorems in the text on my own. This is a complete contrast to how I feel in topology and analysis (not that I really know any topology or analysis), where I have a halfway decent intuition and really think I know why things are true (and moreover, why anyone should care). I'm able to prove theorems. In topology and analysis, I am able to visualize things pretty directly in a way that I can get insight into how things work. For algebra, I have no picture. I've tried learning about Cayley graphs to visualize groups. I think these are neat, but I have yet to successfully apply any insight from them. I hoped learning about algebraic geometry would help me visualize rings. But the geometry in algebraic geometry is dictated entirely by the algebra. So how can you use geometry to help you with the algebra, when you have to do the algebra first to figure out what the geometry looks like? I don't get it. So the question I'm trying to get at is: How do I develop some insight or intuition about algebra? I don't really know what form answers might take; maybe a reading suggestion, or just a general way to look at things. Maybe this isn't a good question, but I'm kind of at the end of my rope with this stuff. A particular user on MathOverflow said he fell in love with algebra the first time he saw the axioms for a group. When I first saw the axioms for a group, I spent the next year trying to figure out why the heck anybody cared about groups (and frankly still only know this in a detached and academic way). So it's possible the only answer is: I'm barking up the wrong tree; algebra isn't for me and I should move on to something that comes more naturally.","['soft-question', 'intuition', 'abstract-algebra']"

13956,Domain of the Gamma function,"I need to find the domain of the Gamma function, that is to say all $z \in \mathbb{C}$, for which the integral: $$\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} \mathrm dt$$ converges. I started by splitting up the integral into an integral running from $0$ to $1$ and another one from $1$ to $\infty$. I first tried to figure out for what $z \in \mathbb{C}$ the integral from $0$ to $1$ converges and I came to the conclusion, that $\Re(z) > 0$ is the condition. The other integral, I believe, converges for every $z$, as the exponential function dominates the monomial eventually. So I concluded: $$\exists \Gamma(z) \iff \Re(z) > 0$$ However, I just learned that this is wrong. I found out that the integral only diverges for non-positive integers. What did I do wrong or what is a better way to find the domain of the Gamma function?","['gamma-function', 'special-functions', 'analysis']"
