133494,Complex derivative,"The derivative of a function $f(x)$ is the limit of the quotient
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
A formula defining the fractional derivative of the same function is for example:
$$\frac{d^{\frac{1}{2}}}{d(x-a)^{\frac{1}{2}}}f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\pi)}}\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^{x}\frac{f(\tau)}{\sqrt{(x-\tau})}d\tau$$
My question is:
is it possible to define an imaginary derivative 
$$\frac{d^i}{dx^{i}}f(x)$$ of the function $f(x)$?

133501,Why are locally closed subschemes not open subschemes of closed subschemes?,"Ravi Vakil gives the following argument for why open subschemes of closed subschemes are locally closed: ""Clearly an open subscheme U of a closed subscheme V of X can be interpreted as a closed subscheme of an open subscheme: as the topology of V is induced from the topology of X, the underlying set of U is the intersection of some open subset U' on X with V. We can take V' = $V \bigcap U'$, and then $V' \rightarrow U'$ is a closed embedding, and $U' \rightarrow X$ is an open embedding. What I don't understand is why this argument doesn't also give the converse. It seems to me that if the words ""closed"" and ""open"" are switched in the above argument, we will ""prove"" that locally closed subschemes are open subschemes of closed subschemes. But this is false; what is wrong with the ""proof""?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

133535,(Minimal?) Polynomials using the Nullstellensatz,"I'm struggling with an exercise that was asked in class: Let $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{3} + \sqrt{7}\sqrt[4]{2}.$ Show that there is a polynomial $p$ in
  the ideal $I=\left&lta^3 - 3, b^2 - 7, c^4-2, \tilde{\alpha}-(a+bc)\right> \subset \mathbb{Q}[a,b,c,\tilde{\alpha}]$ depending only on $\tilde{\alpha}$ with $p(\alpha) = 0$ (ie substituting the real number $\alpha$ for the variable $\tilde{\alpha}$ gives zero). If we can
  choose this polynomial to be irreducible, it is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$. You may assume the Nullstellensatz. The approach I tried was to say that over $\mathbb{C}$, $V(I)$ is the points $(\omega^d\sqrt[3]{3},\pm\sqrt{7},\pm i\sqrt[4]{2}, \omega^d\sqrt[3]{3}+ \pm\sqrt{7}\pm i\sqrt[4]{2})$, where $\omega$ is a cube root of 1. Hence the polynomial $ P = \Pi (\tilde{\alpha} -  (\omega^d\sqrt[3]{3}+ \pm\sqrt{7}\pm i\sqrt[4]{2}))$ is in $I(V(I))$, so there is some $N > 0$ with $P^N \in I \subset \mathbb{C}[a,b,c,\tilde{\alpha}]$ (and obviously $\alpha$ is a root of this). I was then trying to show that this must be in $\mathbb{Q}[a,b,c,\tilde{\alpha}]$; but I couldn't get there (also don't think this is true in general). Can anyone offer any guidance? I know this is really representative of a general method of finding the polynomials that vanish on the sums and products of algebraic numbers given their minimal polynomials. Eg if $\alpha, \beta$ solve $f, g$, this gives polynomials that vanishe on $\alpha + \beta$ or $\alpha\beta$... Any insight on why this works in the general case would be great too. Thanks! (N.b. I've adited this for accuracy: I was assuming before that this gives minimal polynomials, rather than just ones that vanish.)","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials']"

133583,"Understanding analysis/integration properties over $[0,1]$ and $[0,\infty)$ from an algebraic perspective?","I've noticed that in analysis we often treat the unit-interval $[0,1]$ differently from $[0,\infty)$, particularly in improper-integration (but certainly not limited to). By lieu of example, consider proving that the Gamma function converges; i.e., the integral exists. The Gamma function is defined as follows: $$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$ Typical proofs I've encountered consider the two cases over the interval $[0,1]$ and $[0,\infty)$. This is because of the properties of $t^{z-1}e^{-t}$ over $[0,\infty)$. (Sorry, I'm not going to go in detail here; it's just an example.) However, this has me wondering: what makes the unit-interval $[0,1] \subset \mathbb R$ so special? Although I'm mindful that I may be splitting-hairs, I'm seeking to understand if there's some concept that generalizes the properties of the unit-interval; perhaps this suggests why we may often have to treat it differently in, for example,  integration-problems? I'm looking for something related to the closed multiplicative (group under multiplication?) of $[0,1]$. As a start, I know that from elementary calculus, $ \lim_{x -> \infty} a^x = 0 $  if $a \in [0,1)$, $a^x=1$ if $a=1$ and $a^x=\infty$ if a>1. I'm thinking my answer lies somewhere in field-theory / group theory under the operation multiplication. Obviously the question is open-ended, but I'm hoping there is some general property about the interval between the multiplicative and additive identities of $\mathbb R$ that perhaps explain why we may often have to treat it differently. (Again, I apologize for being so vague; just looking for someone to direct me to further reading/subjects/theorems.)","['recreational-mathematics', 'group-theory', 'analysis']"

133638,How does this equation to find the radius from 3 points actually work?,"I had searched online and found an equation that solves the radius of a circle from 3 points that are located on the circumference of that specific circle. Where I had found this formula did not state its derivation or anything of the likes, however it is to find the radius. With the 3 points, you should form a triangle. Let us call this Triangle $ABC$. Using the distance formula, we can calculate the distance between $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$. To simplify things, let us call these distances A, B, and C respectively. We also need the area of the triangle. After finding an altitude of the specified triangle, we can use the area of a triangle equation to solve for it. Let us call the area of this triangle $K$. This is the formula: $r = \dfrac{ABC}{4K}$ Which is essentially saying $radius = \dfrac{\text{Product~of~the~triangle~side~lengths}}{\text{The~area~of~the~triangle~multiplied~by~4}}$ This above pseudo equation was just to clarify the formula, I understand everyone here are exceptional mathematicians, and as I mature, I also hope to become one as well.

133643,Power series solution for a DE,"I am trying to find the general solution of the DE $y''+y=x$ with a Maclaurin series. I know that I could solve this using the Principle of Superposition by finding a particular solution and the general solution to the homogeneous $y''+y=0$ (which yields the solution $y=acosx+bsinx+x$) but I am looking for what I am doing wrong. If we let $y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n$ then, by substituting into the original DE we can obtain a recursive relation. After substituting and rearranging I obtained:$$2c_2+c_0+[6c_3+c_1]x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+1}(n+2)(n+1)+c_n=0+x+\sum_{n=2}^\infty0$$
This gives the recurrence relation $$c_{n+2}=-\frac{c_n}{(n+2)(n+1)}, n>1$$ and the relationships $2c_2+c_0=0$ and $6c_3+c_1=1$ which allows us to solve $c_2$ and $c_3$ in terms of $c_0$ and $c_1$: $c_2=-\frac{c_0}{2}$, $c_3$=$-\frac{c_1-1}{6}$. The solution for the recurrence relation is given by $$c_{2n}=(-1)^n\frac{c_0}{(2n)!}, c_{2n+1}=(-1)^n\frac{c_1-1}{(2n+1)!},n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$$ However, if I substitute these solutions into the assumed form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^n=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{2n}x^{2n}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{2n+1}x^{2n+1}$$ we obtain the Maclaurin series for $cosx$ and $sinx$ but no $x$.

133646,Question about the independence definition.,"Why does the independence definition requires that every subfamily of events $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ satisfies $P(A_{i1}\cap \cdots \cap A_{ik})=\prod_j P(A_{ij})$ where $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n$ and $j < n$. My doubt arose from this: Suppose $A_1,A_2$ and $A_3$ such as $P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)=P(A_1)P(A_2)P(A_3)$. Then $$P(A_1\cap A_2)=P(A_1\cap A_2 \cap A_3) + P(A_1\cap A_2 \cap A_3^c)$$
$$=P(A_1)P(A_2)(P(A_3)+P(A_3^c))=P(A_1)P(A_2).$$ So it seems to me that if $P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)=P(A_1)P(A_2)P(A_3)$ then $P(A_i\cap A_j)=P(A_i)P(A_j)$, i.e., the biggest collection independence implies the smaller ones.

133652,Proving Binet's Fibonacci Formula via uniqueness of recurrence solutions,"As I showed in another question of mine , it is easy to prove that $$\tag{1}\phi^{n+1} =F_{n+1} \phi+F_{n }$$ given $F_1=1$ , $F_2=1$ , $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}\text{ ; }n\geq2$. Now, extending $(1)$  to negative and zero indices naturally yields:
$$\eqalign{
  & {F_{ 0}} = 0  \cr 
  & {F_{ - 1}} = 1  \cr 
  & {F_{ - 2}} =  - 1  \cr 
  & {F_{ - 3}} = 2  \cr 
  & {F_{ - 4}} =  - 3  \cr 
  & {F_{ - n}} = {\left( { - 1} \right)^{n+1}}{F_{n}} \cr} $$ From this one has $${\phi ^{  - n}} = {\left( { - 1} \right)^{n + 1}}\left( {{F_{n }}\phi  - {F_{n + 1}}} \right)$$ A few examples: $$\eqalign{
  & {\phi ^{ - 1}} = \phi  - 1  \cr 
  & {\phi ^{ - 2}} = 2 - \phi   \cr 
  & {\phi ^{ - 3}} = 2\phi  - 3 \cr} $$ Then one has that $$\eqalign{
  & {\left( { - \frac{1}{\phi }} \right)^n} = {F_{n + 1}} - {F_n}\phi   \cr 
  & {\phi ^n} = {F_n}\phi  + {F_{n - 1}} \cr} $$ and consequently $$\eqalign{
  & {\phi ^n} + {\left( { - \frac{1}{\phi }} \right)^n} = {F_n}\phi  + {F_{n - 1}} + {F_{n + 1}} - {F_n}\phi   \cr

  & {\phi ^n} + {\left( { - \frac{1}{\phi }} \right)^n} = {L_n} \cr} $$ How can this be put into an acceptable proof?

I want to show that $T$ is continuous if and only if $\ker T $ is closed. My Attempt. $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $T$ is continuous. Then if $x_n\to x$, then $T(x_n)\to T(x)$. Let $x_n \in \ker T$. Then $T(x_n) = 0$. Using continuity, $$ T(x) = \lim_{n\to \infty} T(x_n) = 0.$$ Hence $x\in \ker T$ and thus $\ker T$ is closed. $(\Leftarrow)$  Suppose $T$ is not continuous. So $T$ is not bounded. i.e. $\exists$ a sequence $x_n$ such that $T(x_n) \to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Let $a\notin \ker T$. Then defining $$x_n' = a - \frac{T(a)}{T(x_n)}x_n ,$$ it is clear that $T(x_n') = 0$ and so $x_n'\in \ker T$. Also $x_n' \to a \notin \ker T.$ So $\ker T$ is not closed.

By the projection formula $f_* F \otimes M = f_*(F \otimes f^*M)$.
Using this we see $f_* F \otimes N' \to f_*F \otimes N = f_*(F \otimes f^*N' \to F \otimes f^*N)$ (the pushforward of the morphism, right?).

A magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is the same, except that $\{1, \ldots, n^2\}$ should be interpreted as a multiset of congruence classes modulo m. Suppose I have an n x n magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Is there a simple way to tell if it is the image of a magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$ under the (element-wise) canonical projection map $a_{i,j} \mapsto a_{i,j}+m\mathbb{Z}$? It's easy to come up with examples that are the image of a magic square. But not every one is. Two examples where this may fail are:
$m=n=2$ $A=
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1  \end{array} \right)$ and $m=n=3$ $A=

1 & 2 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 0 \end{array} \right) $ Adding the identity to A in this case gives another counterexample of a slightly less trivial nature. However, for $m=2$, $n=3$, every magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the preimage of a magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$. This is extremely easy to see, since there are 5 ones and 4 zeros, so the matrix must be the image of the Lo Shu Square (up to permuting rows and columns).There are no magic squares with $m=3, n=2$. There are doable larger cases, but none of the ones I tried gave anything that seemed generic. In general, what I would expect is that for m large compared to n, there won't be any additional ones; this is obvious if $m \ge n^3$ (better bounds are certainly possible). But for m small and n large, there might be more magic squares. And of course, if $m|n$ then cases like the 3x3 above will probably crop up. The question I'm more interested in than the sort of general results above, though, is for a particular magic square over $\mathbb{Z}_m$, what is a fast way to check if it is the image of a magic square over $\mathbb{Z}$ (if such a way exists at all).","['matrices', 'recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory', 'combinatorics']"

$$\mathfrak{J}(x)=\frac{v(x)}{w(x)}$$ \begin{align}
\int \mathfrak{J}(x)\,dx&=\int \frac{v(x)}{w(x)}\,dx\\
\frac{v(x)}{w(x)}&=q(x)+\frac{r(x)}{w(x)} \quad \deg r<\deg w\\

\int \frac{c_ix^i}{w(x)}&=\int \frac{k_{1,i}}{(x-r_1)^{\alpha_1}}+\dots+\int\frac{k_{m,i}}{(x-r_m)^{\alpha_m}}\\
&=k_{1,i}\int \frac{1}{(x-r_1)^{\alpha_1}}+\dots+k_{m,i}\int\frac{1}{(x-r_m)^{\alpha_m}}\\
&=k_{1,i}p_{1,i}(x)+\dots+k_{m,i}p_{m,i}(x)\\

  Galois group is a $p$-group (i.e., the degree $[K:F]$ is a power of $p$). Such an 
  extension is called a $p$-extension (note that $p$-extensions are Galois by 
  definition). Let $L$ be a $p$-extension of $K$. Prove that the Galois closure of $L$ over $F$ is a $p$-extension of $F$. This is what I've done so far: Using the tower law we can readily show that $L$ is a $p$ extension of $F$ so we have $[L:F]=p^{\ell}$ for some integer $\ell$.  Then if $M$ is the Galois closure of $L$ over $F$ then $$[M:F]=[M:L][L:F]$$ and therefore $[M:F]=p^{\ell}n$ for some integer $n$ that is not divisible by $p$.  So $[M:L]=n$. From here it seems like I want to show that either $n=1$ or that $n$ is in fact a power of $p$. I just don't see how to proceed. I've considered using the Sylow Theorems, but I'm not sure how that would really work.

134193,What is meant by a continuous-time white noise process?,"What is meant by a continuous-time white noise process? In a discussion following a question a few months ago, I stated that as an engineer, I am used to thinking 
of a continuous-time wide-sense-stationary white noise process 
$\{X(t) \colon -\infty < t < \infty\}$
as a zero-mean process having autocorrelation function $R_X(\tau) = E[X(t)X(t+\tau)] =  \sigma^2\delta(\tau)$ where $\delta(\tau)$ is the Dirac delta or impulse, and power spectral density $S_X(f) = \sigma^2, -\infty < f < \infty$. At that time, several people with very high reputation on Math.SE
assured me
that this was an unduly restrictive notion, and that no difficulties arise
if one takes the autocorrelation function to be
$$E[X(t)X(t+\tau)] = \begin{cases}\sigma^2, & \tau = 0,\\
0, & \tau \neq 0. \end{cases}$$ What engineers like to call a white noise process is a hypothetical
beast that is never observed directly in any physical system, but 
which can be used to account for
the fact that the output of a linear time-invariant system whose
input is thermal noise is well-modeled by a wide-sense-stationary
Gaussian process whose power spectral density is proportional to
$|H(f)|^2$ where $H(f)$ is the transfer function of the linear
system. Standard second-order random process theory says that
the input and output power spectral densities $S_X(f)$ nd $S_Y(f)$
are related as
$$S_Y(f) = S_X(f)|H(f)|^2.$$
Thus, pretending that thermal noise is a white Gaussian noise process in the
engineering sense and pretending that the second-order theory 
extends to white noise processes (even though their variance is not finite) allows us to get to the result that the output power
spectral density is proportional to $|H(f)|^2$. My query about the definition of a white noise process
is occasioned by a more recent question regarding the variance of a random variable $Y$ defined as
$$Y = \int_0^T h(t)X(t)\ \mathrm dt$$
where $\{X(t)\}$ is a white Gaussian noise process.
The answer given by Nate Eldredge leads to
$$\operatorname{var}(Y) = \sigma^2 \int_0^T |h(t)|^2\ \mathrm dt$$
(as I pointed out in a comment on the answer) if the autocorrelation
function is taken to be $R_X(\tau) = \sigma^2\delta(\tau)$
(the engineering definition).  However, the OP on that question
specified $R_X(0) = \sigma^2$, not $\sigma^2\delta(\tau)$,
that is, the definition accepted by mathematicians.  For
this autocorrelation function, the variance is
$$\int_0^T \int_0^T E[X(t)X(s)]h(t)h(s)\mathrm dt\mathrm ds = 0$$
since the integrand is nonzero only on a set of measure $0$. So, what is the variance of the random variable $Y$? and what
do readers of Math.SE understand by the phrase white noise process ? Perhaps this question should be converted to a Community wiki?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'noise']"

Finally, $[K\colon\mathbb{Q}]=8$. I want to compute the Galois group $K/\mathbb{Q}$. Since the extension is Galois, there are 8 elements in this group. It turns out that this group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8 (I've seen examples of this but don't have a reference). What steps would I take to reach the conclusion that this group is the dihedral group? Specifically I know that each automorphism of the Galois group permutes the roots, but I don't see how to make the connection that these elements are the same as the dihedral group of order 8.

$ However, the answer given to this question did not utilise the pooled estimator. Instead, it just uses back the sample proportion for the ${ \sigma  }_{ \hat { p }  }$. So, the answer given is written this way:
$
{ \sigma  }_{ \hat { p_1 } -\hat{p_2} }=\sqrt { \frac { p_{ 1 }(1-p_{ 1 }) }{ n_{ 1 } } +\frac { p_{ 2 }(1-p_{ 2 }) }{ n_{ 2 } }  } =\sqrt { \frac { \frac { 205 }{ 250 } (1-\frac { 205 }{ 250 } ) }{ 250 } +\frac { \frac { 137 }{ 250 } (1-\frac { 137 }{ 250 } ) }{ 250 }  } =0.03976\\ Z=\frac { \frac { 205 }{ 250 } -\frac { 137 }{ 250 } -0.15 }{ { \sigma  }_{ \hat { p_1 } -\hat{p_2} } } =3.0684
$ Should I use a pooled estimator for $\hat{p}$ in this case? From my understanding, I use the pooled estimator for $\hat{p}$ when I don't have the true population proportion values. In this question, the given values are only the sampled proportions. But often, I wouldn't know the true population proportion values in the first place and therefore, I would always end up using the pooled estimator if I rely on my understanding. So, in what situation should I then be using a pooled estimator and what other situation should I then not be using a pooled estimator?",['statistics']
134353,Del Pezzo surface of degree 4 is intersection of two quadrics?,"Let $S$ be a del Pezzo surface $S$ of degree $4$. There is an exact sequence $$ 0\to H^0(\mathbb{P}^4,I_S(2)) \to H^0(\mathbb{P}^4,\mathcal{O}(2))\to H^0(S,\mathcal{O}_S(2))\to0$$ where $I_S$ is the ideal sheaf of $S$. Let $K$ be a canonical divisor. We have $$H^0(S,\mathcal{O}(-2K_S))=13.$$ The claim is $$H^0(S,\mathcal{O}(-2K_S))=H^0(S,\mathcal{O}(2))$$ and from this it follows that $S$ is the base locus of a pencil of quadrics. I neither understand the isomorphism nor how the statement about the base locus follows, could anyone elaborate? This is from Dolgachev:"" Classical Algebraic Geometry: a Modern View"" (Thm 8.2.6) Thanks a lot.

134362,Calculating the Zeroes of the Riemann-Zeta function,"Wikipedia states that The Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is defined for all complex numbers $s \neq 1$. It has zeros at the negative even integers (i.e. at $s = −2, −4, −6, ...)$. These are called the trivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the non-trivial zeros, and states that: The real part of any non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is $\frac{1}{2}$. What does it mean to say that $\zeta(s)$ has a $\text{trivial}$ zero and a $\text{non-trivial}$ zero. I know that $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$$ what wikipedia claims it that $\zeta(-2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{2} = 0$ which looks absurd. My question is can somebody show me how to calculate a zero for the $\zeta$ function.","['analytic-number-theory', 'riemann-zeta', 'number-theory']"
134366,Intersection of two parabolae,"Problem :
Consider two parabolae such that their axes of symmetry form a right angle. Prove that all four points of intersection lie on a common circle (it is an assumption that there exist such four points). Could you help me obtain a non-algebraic solution? (The algebraic one I did is given below.) Algebraic solution: There is a very simple algebraic approach, just introduce a Cartesian coordinate system such that the parabolae are given by equations: $$y = \alpha_1 x^2 + \beta_1 $$
$$x = \alpha_2 y^2 + \beta_2 $$ and by scaling, adding and simplifying we can get the following ordinary circle equation (the right-hand side is positive because parabolae intersect):
$$ \left(x-\frac{1}{2\alpha_2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{1}{2\alpha_1}\right)^2 = \frac{-\beta_1}{\alpha_1} + \frac{-\beta_2}{\alpha_2} + \left(\frac{1}{2\alpha_1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2\alpha_2}\right)^2$$ Non-algebraic solution: ??","['geometry', 'conic-sections', 'euclidean-geometry']"

134410,An Infinite cyclic group has exactly two generators.,"Question: An infinite cyclic group has exactly two generators. Answer: Suppose $G=\langle a\rangle$ is an infinite cyclic group. If $b=a^{n}\in G$ is a generator of $G$ then as $a\in G,\ a=b^{m}={(a^{n})}^{m}=a^{nm}$ for some $m\in Z$. $\therefore$ We have $a^{nm-1}=e.$ (We know that  the cyclic group $G=\langle a\rangle$ is infinite if and only if $0$ is the only integer for which $a^{0}=e$.)
So, we have, $nm-1=0\Rightarrow nm=1.$
As $n$ and $m$ are integers, we have $n=1,n=-1.$ Now, $n=1$ gives $b=a$ which is already a generator and $n=-1$ gives 
$$H=\langle a^{-1}\rangle =\{(a^{-1})^{j}\mid j\in Z\} =\{a^{k}\mid k\in Z\}=G$$
That is $a^{-1}$ is also generator of $g$ My question is that am I approaching this question correctly?","['cyclic-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'infinite-groups']"
134434,Parallel transport in discrete differential geometry - programming a game,"I would like to get a better intuitive grip on how parallel transport works. I once saw a video a German guy made with a little car having a gyroscope. That car was dragged on a big beach ball and the wheels moved. Simultaneously, a small arrow on top of that car was ""parallel transported"" via the modified gyro mechanism. What I aim to construct is an algorithm that doesn't make use of any parametric equations, nor of the Christoffel Symbols, connections, etc. on manifolds as they'd introduce a vicious circle. I'd like to start with a discrete polyhedral manifold and move an object that ""lives"" in the tangent space of that manifold along a given curve. This may sound too general, so, for starters, consider a smooth manifold, that's not discrete as I initially proposed. Say my entity is at a point A on that manifold on knows that it has to hold an arrow/vector in a given direction while moving towards another point B . A and B are connected via a very small curve. If v was the direction in A , how would it look like when it reaches B ? That's the goal of the algorithm. So, to rephrase the question, how can one know how to rotate and translate the tangent space from A to B if the displacement is small, but it does actually take place on a portion of a manifold, not in the normal Euclidian space? In case of a sphere, there is no theoretical notion of ""keep the arrow pointing towards the East"" - due to the Hairy ball theorem.. but all intuitive explanations of parallel transport do make use of such a notion, a notion of keeping a vector pointing in a certain ""constant"" direction. That ""constant"" direction is a notion that makes sense only when referring to what happens in the tangent space at a point, right? So, how would one correctly approach this: a small vehicle on a manifold, in a virtual/game environment. The vehicle moves (and it has wheels! - these might help gather rotation/distortion/etc information from the curved manifold it lies on). On top of the vehicle, a vector should me moved like it was parallel transported. To cut it short, please analyze the already classic applet . Sorry for the very long description..","['differential-geometry', 'discrete-geometry']"
