1802925,Difficult probability of choosing ball from bag with $7$ balls labelled from $1-7$,"This is a very interesting word problem that I came across in an old textbook of mine. So I know its got something to do with probability, which perhaps yields the shortest, simplest proofs, but other than that, the textbook gave no hints really and I'm really not sure about how to approach it. Any guidance hints or help would be truly greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance :) So anyway, here the problem goes: A bag contains seven balls numbered from $1$ to $7$. A ball is chosen at random
  and its number is noted. The ball is then returned to the bag. This is done a total of seven times. $(a)$ What is the probability that each ball is selected exactly once? $(b)$ What is the probability that at least one ball is not selected? $(c)$ What is the probability that exactly one of the balls is not selected? My thoughts: $(a)\, \left(\frac 17\right)^7=\frac{1}{823543}$ $(b) \, 1 - \frac{1}{823543}?$ $(c)$ No idea on this one. My head aches after just thinking about it.",['probability']
1802930,Constructing bijection from set of equivalence classes to another set,"Suppose $f:A \to B$ is surjective. Define a relation on $A$ by setting $x\sim y$ if $f(x) = f(y)$ . It is clear that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ . Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ . Prove that there is a bijection from $\mathcal{E} $ to $B$ . Attempt: We know $[e] = \{ x : f(e) = f(x) \} $ and $\mathcal{E} = \{ [e] : e \in A \} $ . Define $\varphi: \mathcal{E} \to B$ by $\varphi( [e] ) = f(e) $ . First, notice that if $[e] = [e']$ , then $\varphi( [e] ) = f(e) = f(e') = \varphi( [e']))$ so $\varphi$ is well defined. Next, if $f(e) \neq f(e')$ then $(e,e') \notin\; \sim$ . So $[e] \neq [e']$ so we have injectivity Finally, since $f$ is already surjective, we know that for every $b \in B$ , there is some $a \in A$ so that $f(a) = b$ . So, for every $b \in A$ , there is some $e \in A$ (so some $[e] \in \mathcal{E}$ ) such that $\varphi( [e] ) = f(e) \in B $ . so we have surjectivity Is this an enough argument? thanks","['real-analysis', 'equivalence-relations', 'functions', 'proof-verification']"
1802939,What is the significance of reversing the polarity of the negative eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix?,"Consider a full rank $n\times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ (coming from a set of physical measurements). I do an eigendecomposition of this matrix as $$A = E V E^T$$ Most of the eigenvalues are positive, while a few are negative but with much smaller magnitude compared to the maximum eigenvalue. I want to convert this matrix into a positive definite one but with minimal damage, for the purpose of my experiments. So I naively invert the polarity of the negative eigenvalues and construct a PSD matrix $$B = E |V| E'$$ Later, I realized there is a whole lot of research and algorithms available to find the nearest PSD matrix to a given symmetric matrix and what I am doing is not the right way. So I got hold of a few of those algorithms (with code) and tried out. These algorithms give nearest PSD matrix $C$ to $A$ than $B$ in terms of $2$-norm and Frobenius norm. Surprising part is when I use them in my experiments, I get far better results with $B$ than any of those algorithms. My understanding is that those algorithms usually end up in a low rank matrix (semi definite) and they do $C+\lambda I$ to make it make it a PSD where we get to choose $\lambda$. I am not able to understand fully why $B$ is giving good results than $C$ and what is the significance of $B$. I'd like to understand this as i want better solution than naively going for $B$ albeit it gives results.","['matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'numerical-linear-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

1803030,Is it Possible to Show that the Determinant of a Symplectic Matrix is 1 Using Induction?,"We have for a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$ that $A$ is symplectic if and only if $\det A =1$. Is there any way to use this fact as the base for an inductive proof of the fact that the determinant of any symplectic matrix is $1$? I tried writing it out in block matrix form but realized quickly that it was not as simple as I had thought, since: $a_{1,2} \dots a_{1,2n}$, and $a_{2,1}, \dots , a_{2n,1}$ don't have to be zero (although maybe this is possible to achieve via some similarity transformation that preserves the symplectic property?) The block matrix formed by deleting the first row and column doesn't have the correct dimensions to even be a symplectic matrix. It is unclear what the $2n-2 \times 2n-2$ matrix would be to use the inductive hypothesis for $n-1$ would be.

1803105,Why is the index $i(\mathcal{L})$ of an ample line bundle on an abelian variety equal to $0$?,"I've seen that here https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~ngo/Shimura.pdf there's a theorem called Mumford's Vanishing Theorem (Theorem 2.2.2) which says: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a line bundle on $X$ (abelian variety) such that $K(\mathcal{L})$ is finite. There exists a unique integer $i=i(\mathcal{L})$, $0\leq i(\mathcal{L})\leq g=\dim X$, such that $H^p(X,\mathcal{L})=(0)$ for $p\neq i$ and $H^i(X,\mathcal{L})\neq (0)$. Moreover, $\mathcal{L}$ is ample if and only if $i(\mathcal{L})=0$. This theorem has no proof here, and I'm intersted in understanding the last claim because, in the book ""Abelian Varieties"" of Mumford, the Vanishing Theorem doesn't say this result but it actually uses it implicity in the beginning of proof of the theorem at page 163 (old edition). So my question is: why is it true that $\mathcal{L}$ is ample if and only if $i(\mathcal{L})=0$? In particular I'm intersted in the implication $\mathcal{L}$ ample implies $i(\mathcal{L})=0$.

My attempt: by changing coordinates to spherical: $x=r\sin\phi\cos\theta~,~y=r\sin\phi\sin\theta~,~z=r\cos\phi$ we obtain the Jacobian $J=r^2\sin\phi$. When $\phi$ and $\theta$ are fixed, $r$ varies from $0$ to $\sqrt[3]{\sin\phi\cos\theta}$ (because $r^4=r\sin\phi\cos\theta$). Keeping $\theta$ fixed, we let $\phi$ vary from $0$ to $\pi$. Thus the volume equals: $$V=\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\sqrt[3]{\sin\phi\cos\theta}}r^2\sin\phi ~dr ~d\phi ~d\theta=0$$

1803182,Alice and Bob make all numbers to zero game,"Alice and Bob are playing a number game in which they write $N$ positive integers. Then the players take turns, Alice took first turn. In a turn : A player selects one of the integers, divides it by $2, 3, 4, 5$ or $6$, and then takes the floor to make it an integer again. If the integer becomes 0, it is erased from the board. The player who makes the last move wins. Assuming both play optimally, we need to predict who wins the game. Example : Let N=2 and numbers are [3,4] then alice is going to win this one. Explanation : Alice can win by selecting 4 and then dividing it by 2. The integers on the board are now [3,2]. 
Bob can make any choice, but Alice will always win. Bob can divide 2 by 3, 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 3, and Alice can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game. Bob can divide 3 by 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 2, and Alice can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game. Bob can divide 2 by 2. Now the integers are [1,3]. Alice can respond by dividing 3 by 3. The integers are now [1,1]. Now Bob has no choice but to divide 1 by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and remove it (because it becomes 0). Alice can respond by dividing the remaining 1 by 2 to finish, and win, the game. Bob can divide 3 by 2 or 3. Now the integers are [1,2]. Alice can respond by dividing 2 by 2.

1803231,Best way to go about solving specific tricky 2.ODE,"I've been working on this equation for a while now.

I then worked out what these would be for $y''$ and $y'$ and put them back in the original equation $y''-4y+y$. This resulted in:$$y_{p1}:-2a-2at-2b=t,y_{p2}:a=t(1+3a)$$
So normally I'd be rid of the $t$'s and found a value for the $a$'s. Am I just doing this wrong, or can I not use undetermined coefficients here? Anyways, I also tried variation of parameters and ended up with this abomination: $$y_h=c_1e^{2t+\sqrt{3}t}+c_2e^{2t-\sqrt{3}t}$$

1803257,Series of integrable functions converges pointwise almost everywhere,"I need some help, solving the following problem I found in my textbook. QUESTIONS APPEAR IN BOLD CAPITALS . Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and $f_n \colon X \to \mathbb{C}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) be a sequence of integrable functions such that
  $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_X |f_n| \mathrm{d}\mu < \infty.$$ Then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ converges almost everywhere to an integrable function $f \colon X \to \mathbb{C}$ and 
  $$ \int_X f \mathrm{d}\mu = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \int_X f_n \mathrm{d}\mu.$$ I know that monotonous convergence gives me
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_X |f_n| \mathrm{d}\mu =\int_X  \sum_{n=1}^\infty  |f_n| \mathrm{d}\mu,$$
i.e. $\sum_{n=1}^\infty  |f_n|$ is integrable.
Integrability of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty  |f_n|$ gives me that this series converges almost everywhere.
Hence, if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n(x)|$ converges, also $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)$ converges. This implies that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ converges almost everywhere to some $f$. Furthermore, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n|$ a majorant for $|\sum_{n=1}^\infty  f_n|$ and since $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ is measurable as the limit of measurable functions this gives the integrability of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$. WHY IS $f$ MEASURABLE? ( I think, this won't be the case if the measure space is not assumed to be complete. Am I right? But in case the measure space IS complete, I am good to go on. ) If I have this, then $f$ would be integrable as well, because it almost everywhere equals an integrable function. This implies
$$\int_X f\mathrm{d}\mu = \int_X \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n \mathrm{d}\mu.$$ BUT WHY IS THIS EQUAL TO $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_X  f_n \mathrm{d}\mu$?","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

1803293,A question about a route of a point that travels in a particular way through the plane,"I don't know exactly how to classify this question. It is not from any homeworks, just something I've been wondering about. Let's say that in the beginning of an experiment ( the beginning is $t=0$ secs) we have two points on the plane: one on $(0,0)$ and one on $(0, 1)$. They start moving by the following rules: The point that was on $(0,0)$ moves right, on the $x$-axis, in a constant speed of $1~\text{m}/\text{s}$. The point that was on $(0,1)$ also moves in a constant speed of $1~\text{m}/\text{s}$, but its direction changes, so that the direction of its speed is always directed to the first point (like a missile that follows a moving object).

1803303,Why does the coordinate transformation from Cartesian coordinates leads to an additional term in the biharmonic operator in spherical coordinates,"I am trying to solve a problem in physics where the biharmonic operator is involved. I think that the bihahmonic operator can be obtained by taking twice the Laplace operator, such that $\nabla^4 f = \nabla^2 (\nabla^2 f)$. 
Here $f$ is a function of the polar angle $\phi$ only (i.e. in the axisymmetric case for the sake of simplicity.)
In this way, the Laplace operator reads
$$
\nabla^2 f(\phi) = \frac{1}{a^2 \sin\phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \left( \sin\phi \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi} \right) \, ,
$$
where $a$ being the sphere radius.
In principle, the biharmonic operator is obtained after applying twice the above operation, to obtain
$$
\nabla^4 f(\phi) = \frac{1}{a^4} 
\left( 
\frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial \phi^4} 
+ 2\cot\phi \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial \phi^3}
-(2+\cot^2 \phi) \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}
+\cot\phi (1+\cot^2\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi}
\right) \, .
$$
However, if we start from the biharmonic equation in Cartesian coordinates, namely
$$
\nabla^4 f(x,y,z) = \frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial x^4} 
+ \frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial y^4} 
+ \frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial z^4}
+ 2 \left( 
\frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial x^2 \partial y^2}
+ \frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial y^2 \partial z^2}
+ \frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial x^2 \partial z^2}
\right) \, ,
$$
and apply the coordinate transformation to spherical, e.g. using Maple PDEchangecoords and of course drop the dependence on $r$ and $\theta$, I get the following biharmonic
$$
\nabla^4 f(\phi) = \frac{1}{a^4} 
\left( 
\frac{\partial^4 f}{\partial \phi^4} 
+ 2\cot\phi \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial \phi^3}
-\cot^2 \phi\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}
+\cot\phi (3+\cot^2\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi}
\right) \, ,
$$
i.e. the following additional terms appear
$$
\frac{2}{a^4} \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi} \cot \phi \right) \, ,

1803419,How to solve probability when sample space is infinite?,"I came up with a random problem yesterday: Suppose that in a random trial, each point $(x,y)$ where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $0 \leq x,y \leq 1$ is assigned a value of $0$ with 50% chance and a value of $1$ with 50% chance. What is a chance that there is a 'continuous path' that joins the point (0,0) and the point (1,1), such that along the path every single point has the same assigned value? My intuition sort of says that the probability should be zero, but I don't really have a good reason why. For one thing, any particular path from (0,0) to (1,1) should have a 0% chance of occurring, but there are also an infinite number of possible paths from the point (0,0) to (1,1). In my head, the probability should depend on whether the ""zero"" was smaller than the ""infinity"" $$P \simeq \text{num paths} * P(\text{chance a path happens})$$ To evaluate the number of total paths, I sort of imagined constructing paths with straight lines. To construct an arbitrary path between (0,0) and (1,1), I would pick some number of intermediate points inbetween the two corners, and specify their $x$ coordinate and $y$ coordinate. Something like: $$\text{num paths} \simeq \aleph_1^2 + \aleph_1^4 + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \aleph_1^{\aleph_0} \simeq \aleph_1^{\aleph_0}$$ (First term is like I have to pick 2 real numbers for a single intermediate point, second term is if I pick 4 real numbers for two intermediate points, and so on) To evaluate the chance that any particular path happens, it's sort of like saying that for every point along the line, it must be assigned the same value. Hence, its sort of like: $$P(\text{chance a path happens}) \simeq \frac{1}{2}^{\aleph_1}$$ So combining the two, we have (very unrigorously): $$P \simeq \aleph_1^{\aleph_0} * \frac{1}{2}^{\aleph_1}$$ This seems not only super unrigorous, but I'm not even sure if you can even do this kind of thing. My friend's words keep echoing in my head, ""something something probability only means something when the sample space is actually defined properly something something""

1803446,What is the average rational number?,"Let $Q=\mathbb Q \cap(0,1)= \{r_1,r_2,\ldots\}$ be the rational numbers in $(0,1)$ listed out so we can count them. Define $x_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^nr_n$ to be the average of the first $n$ rational numbers from the list. Questions: What is required for $x_n$ to converge? Certainly $0< x_n < 1$ for all $n$. Does $x_n$ converge to a rational or irrational? How does the behavior of the sequence depend on the choice of list? I.e. what if we rearrange the list $\mathbb Q \cap(0,1)=\{r_{p(1)},r_{p(2)},\ldots\}$ with some one-to-one permutation $p: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$? How does the behavior of $x_n$ depend on $p$? My thoughts: Intuitively, I feel that we might be able to choose a $p$ so that $x_n\rightarrow y$ for any $y\in[0,1]$. However, it also makes intuitive sense that, if each rational appears only once in the list, that the limit is required to be $\frac{1}{2}.$ Of course, intuition can be very misleading with infinities! If we are allowed to repeat rational numbers with arbitrary frequency (but still capturing every rational eventually), then we might be able to choose a listing so that $x_n\rightarrow y$ for any $y\in(0,\infty)$. This last point might be proved by the fact that every positive real number has a sequence of positive rationals converging to it, and every rational in that list can be expressed as a sum of positive rationals less than one. However, the averaging may complicate that idea, and I'll have to think about it more. Example I: No repetition:
$$Q=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=1}^n \left\{\frac{k}{n+1}\right\} =\left\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{5},\ldots\right\}$$
in which case $x_n\rightarrow\frac{1}{2},$ a very nice and simple example. Even if we keep the non-reduced fractions and allow repetition, i.e. with
$Q=\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{4},\boxed{\frac{2}{4},}\frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{5},\ldots\},$
then $x_n\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}.$ The latter case is easy to prove since we have the subsequence $x_{n_k}=\frac{1}{2}$ for $n_k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2},$ and the deviations from $1/2$ decrease. The non-repetition case, I haven't proved, but simulated numerically, so there may be an error, but I figure there is an easy calculation to show whether it's correct. Example II: Consider the list generated from the Stern-Brocot tree:
$$Q=\left\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{2}{5},\frac{3}{5},\frac{3}{4},\ldots\right\}.$$ I'm sure this list could be studied analytically, but for now, I've just done a numerical simulation. The sequence of averages $x_n$ hits $\frac{1}{2}$ infinitely often, but may be oscillatory and hence not converge. If it converges, it does so much slower than the previous examples. It appears that $x_{2^k-1}=0.5$ for all $k$ and that between those values it comes very close to $0.44,$ e.g. $x_{95743}\approx 0.4399.$ However, my computer code is probably not very efficient, and becomes very slow past this.","['real-analysis', 'rational-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"

And here are some more implied constructions naturally found within, using both pre-existing points form the pre-existing grid, the pre-existing circle, and pre-existing golden ratio constructions all shown above: By using pre-existing points on the pre-existing grid and pre-existing circle to draw the green square, we can again marvel at the golden ratio presented between a and b resulting from the naturally-implied 2x2 green square and the pre-existing circle! By adding the red segment between pre-existing points on the pre-existing grid and pre-existing circle, we can again marvel at the golden ratio between a and b within the realm of the naturally-implied isosceles triangle and pre-existing circle! By using pre-existing points and pre-existing golden ratio constructs to define a smaller orange circle illustrated in the figure below, we can again marvel at the pre-existing golden ratio construct in c:d! Simple geometry immediately shows us that the radius of the smaller orange circle is 2/3 that of the larger pre-existing circle found in the original ""golden ratio symphony"" diagram. Indeed, the golden ratio symphony, despite its simplicity, is a most powerful and far-ranging diagram! Again, beginning with the original golden ratio symphony figure presented above we can draw two blue circles defined by pre-existing points on the grid as shown below, with the top blue circle having the radius of a single square, and the bottom circle having a radius of the pre-existing segment t, while being centered on a point on the grid two squares below the top blue circle: We can then again marvel at the pre-existing golden ratio found in a:b! :) We can then add two yellow equilateral triangles whose sides are equal to the pre-existing segment t where we recall that the radius of the lower blue circle is also defined by the pre-existing segment t, which is based on pre-existing points and pre-existing golden ratio constructs defined in the original golden ratio figure above, and the addition of the two reflected equilateral triangles appears as thus: We can then again celebrate the pre-existing golden ratio of a:b found in the original Golden Ratio Symphony figure as we have done numerous times!","['golden-ratio', 'euclidean-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"

I've checked Mardia and Jupp's Directional Statistics (1999) which seems to be the standard reference, but I'm still bedazzled by its reasoning which goes like: ""To verify that the density integrates to 1, note that the intersection of
$S^p$ with the hyperplane through $t\mu$ and normal $\mu$ is a $(p- 2)$-dimensional sphere of radius $\sqrt{1-t^2}$. Since the modified Bessel function of the first kind and order $\nu$ is
$$I_\nu = \frac{(\kappa/2)^\nu}{\Gamma(\nu +\frac12)\Gamma(\frac12)}\int_{-1}^1e^{\kappa t}(1-t^2)^{\nu -\frac12}dt$$
it follows that $$\int_{S^{p-1}}\exp(\kappa\mu^Tx)dx = B\left(\frac{p-1}2,\frac12\right)^{-1}\int_{-1}^1e^{\kappa t}(1-t^2)^{\frac{p-3}2}dt$$

1804231,Probabilities ant cube,"I have attached a picture of the cube in the question. An ant moves along the edges of the cube always starting at $A$ and never repeating an edge. This defines a trail of edges. For example, $ABFE$ and $ABCDAE$ are trails, but $ABCB$ is not a trail. The number of edges in a trail is known as its length. At each vertex, the ant must proceed along one of the edges that has not yet been traced, if there is one. If there is a choice of untraced edges, the following probabilities for taking each of them apply. If only one edge at a vertex has been traced and that edge is vertical, then the probability of the ant taking each horizontal edge is $\frac12$. If only one edge at a vertex has been traced and that edge is horizontal, then the probability of the ant taking the vertical edge is $\frac23$ and the probability of the ant taking the horizontal edge is $\frac13$. If no edge at a vertex has been traced, then the probability of the ant taking the vertical edge is $\frac23$ and the probability of the ant taking each of the horizontal edges is $\frac16$. In your solutions to the following problems use exact fractions not decimals. a) If the ant moves from $A$ to $D$, what is the probability it will then move to $H$? If the ant moves from $A$ to $E$, what is the probability it will then move to $H$?

y\in (0,-\frac{3x}{2}+3)$ since $y=-\frac{3x}{2}+2 $ is the hypertenuse of $D$. Once I got to calculating the integral itself, I tried multiple changes of variables, such as polar, $u=x, v=\frac{1}{2x+3y}$, $u=x, v=2x+3y$, $u=\frac{1}{2x+3y}, v=-\frac{3x}{2}+3$, and none of these gave an integral that could be calculated using analytical tools only (no numerical tools. I also checked this with mathematica and all of these integrals require numerical tools to calculate). What change of variables can be used here?

1804415,Prove that $f\in L^2$ and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_A f_n = \int_Af$,"Let $A$ be a bounded, measurable susbset of $\mathbb{R}$. Prove that if $(f_n) \subset L^2 (A)$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $A$, then $f\in L^2(A)$ and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_A f_n = \int_Af$. Clearly $f$ is measurable. We have to show that $\int_A f^2 < \infty$. Choose $\epsilon>0$. From uniform convergence we can find $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_{n_0}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x\in A$ and some $n_0>N$. Now denote by $A^-$ the part of $A$ where $f$ is negative and by $A^+$ the part of $A$ where $f$ is positive. Since $f$ is measurable, both sets are measurable. We have $-f(x)<\epsilon - f_{n_0}(x)$ thus $\int_{A^-} f^2< \int_{A^{-}}(\epsilon-f_{n_0})^2<\infty$ (since A is bounded). Similarly, since $f(x)<\epsilon + f_{n_0}(x)$, we get $\int_{A^+} f^2< \int_{A^{+}}(\epsilon+f_{n_0})^2<\infty$ and we can conclude that $f\in L^2 (A)$. It remains to show that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_A f_n = \int_Af$. First we establish convergence in $L^2$ on $A$: $$\|f_n-f\|_2^2=\int_A |f_n(x)-f(x)|^2\,dx \leq m(A) \left(\sup_{x \in A}|f_n(x)-f(x)|\right)^2 \to 0$$ Now we can use CS inequality and conclude that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_A f_n = \int_Af$.

For example, we have that $M_{2, 3, 1}$ is non-orientable, while some others are, such as $M_{3,3,1}$ and $M_{3, 3,2}$. Is there a way to decide in general if $M_{m,n,r}$ is orientable, in terms of $m,n$ and $r$? For example, to see that $M_{2,3,1}$ is non-orientable, we parametrize it using two maps. Call $V_i$ the open set in $M_{2,3,1}$ on which the $i-$th row is a multiple of the other non-zero one. We have $M_{2,3,1} = V_0 \cup V_1$. Put $$\alpha_1:(\Bbb R^3 \setminus\{{\bf 0}\})\times \Bbb R\to V_1, \quad \alpha_1(v,t) = (tv,v),$$and similarly for $\alpha_2$, where we look at these pairs as rows of the matrix. These $\alpha_i$ are good parametrizations that cover $M_{2,3,1}$. One then checks that $\alpha_1^{-1}(V_1\cap V_2)$ has two connected components, namely, $(\Bbb R^3\setminus\{{\bf 0}\}) \times \Bbb R_{>0}$ and $(\Bbb R^3\setminus\{{\bf 0}\}) \times \Bbb R_{<0}$. And $\det D(\alpha_2^{-1}\circ \alpha_1)(v,t)$ changes sign there, so $M_{2,3,1}$ is non-orientable. The strategy for proving that $M_{m,n,r}$ is a submanifold is different and writes it locally as an inverse image of regular value. This is an early exercise in Guillemin & Pollack's Differential Topology book.
