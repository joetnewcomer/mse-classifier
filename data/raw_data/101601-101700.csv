1412747,Do approximate identities remain approximate identities if one adjoins 1 to a C* Algebra?,"If we have a C* Algebra $\mathscr{U}$ without an identity we can adjoin an identity $\mathbb{1}$ in the following way: We take $\mathscr{\tilde U}$ to be the set $\{(\alpha,A); \alpha \in \mathbb{C}, A \in \mathscr{U}  \}$ On $\mathscr{\tilde U}$ we define addition in the obvious way and define multiplication via $(\alpha,A) \cdot (\beta,B) := (\alpha \beta,\alpha B + \beta A +AB)$. Also we can introduce a shorthand notation $(\alpha, A) := \alpha \mathbb{1} + A$ The norm of the new states is defined via:
$$\|\alpha\mathbb{1}+A\| := \sup\{\|\alpha B + AB\|\ ; B \in \mathscr{U},\, \|B\|=1\}$$ The result will again be a C* algebra and $\mathscr{U}$ can be identified as the subset of elements in the form $(0,A)$ of $\mathscr{\tilde U}$. My question is whether an approximate identity on $\mathscr{U}$ will still have the property of being an approximate identity on the new C* Algebra.

1412748,"Can we find uncountably many disjoint dense measurable uncountable subsets of $[0,1]$?","Can we find uncountably many disjoint dense measurable uncountable subsets of $[0,1]$? Obviously we may as well assume all the subsets have measure $0$. If I didn't specify the subsets were uncountable, we could easily find uncountably many dense disjoint measurable subsets $X_\alpha$ (all countable) by taking a Hamel basis $H$ of $\mathbb{R}$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $H$ contains a non-zero rational number, and then set $X_\alpha = (\mathbb{Q} + \alpha) \cap [0,1]$ for every $\alpha \in H$. But what about if we want uncountable measurable dense subsets? I think it should still be that there are uncountably many that can be found that are disjoint, according to my intuition, but I don't know an ""easy"" way to show it like I can in the case of countable dense subsets.","['lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis']"

1412899,Is every axiom in the definition of a vector space necessary?,"Definition: A vector space over a field $K$ consists of a set $V$ and two binary operations $+: V \times V \to V$ and $\cdot: K \times V \to V$ satisfying the following axioms: Commutativity of $+$ . Associativity of $+$ . Existence of an identity element $\mathbf{0}$ for $+$ . Existence of inverses for $+$ . Compatibility of $\cdot$ with multiplication in $K$ . Distributivity of $\cdot$ over $+$ . Distributivity of $\cdot$ over addition in $K$ . $1_K$ is a left identity of $\cdot$ . Question: Are all seven of the previous axioms necessary (in the sense that weakening any one of them permits a structure which is not a vector space)? If not, which can be weakened (or removed)? EDIT: user7530 has quite cleverly shown that the commutativity of $+$ can be derived from axioms 2-8. Supposing we throw this out, can the remaining axioms all be proven necessary? EDIT 2: It was pointed out that axiom 3 cannot simply be thrown out, as the definition of an inverse in axiom 4 depends on the existence of $\mathbf{0}$ . What if we tweak the statement of axiom 4 to axiom 4': ""For every $x \in V$ , there exists $y \in V$ such that $(x+y)+x = x$ and $(y+x)+y = y$ ""?

1412921,Why do polynomial regressions have larger variance at the end?,"In reading the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"", I came across this graph: It shows that the point-wise variance is larger at the ends of the regression curve. Why is that? I thought that the variance may be larger because there seem to be fewer data points near the end, but the variance is calculated on the coefficients so the number of data points used in the estimate has no impact. Then I thought that the variance is larger because the X values are larger, but the graph on the left side shows slight increases in variance on both sides (even when X is small). In general, I have read that polynomials have notorious end behaviours - what causes this? Thanks.","['covariance', 'polynomials', 'statistics', 'regression', 'linear-algebra']"
1412932,What's the sample space for a conditional expectation?,"Define a probability space $(\Omega,\cal F,\Bbb P)$ and a $\cal F$ measurable random variable $X$, the conditional expectation given a sub $\sigma$-algebra $\cal F_0 \subseteq \cal F$ is a random variable $X_0=\Bbb E(X|\cal F_0)$ satisfying the following two conditions: $X_0$ is $\cal F_0$ measurable. For any $E\in \cal F_0$, it holds that $\int_E {X} d\Bbb P =\int_E {X_0} d\Bbb P$. My confusion is that, since $X_0$ is a random variable, it must be a function defined on a sample space, then what is the sample space for $X_0$? Further the sample space must be equipped with a $\sigma$-algebra to form a measurable space, so what is the $\sigma$-algebra? Since $X_0$ is $\cal F_0$ measurable, so I suppose the $\sigma$-algebra associated with the sample space is $\cal F_0$? Thank you!","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"

1412986,Name for kind of big O notation with leading coefficient,"Context: As known the big O notation $O(f(n))$ describes a function $g(n)$ such that there is a constant $C \ge 0$ with $\limsup_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{g(n)}{f(n)}\right| \le C$ (I assume that $f(n)$ is never zero). Thus the big O notation can be used to characterize the speed of convergence (for example for an algorithm). So I can write $$a(n) = a + O\left(\frac 1n\right)$$ which means that the function / algorithm $a(n)$ calculates in almost all calculation steps $n$ the desired number $a$ with an error less than $\frac Cn$ for a constant $C\ge 0$. Problem: Whereby I can compare two algorithms by their speed of convergence with the big O notation, the above notation $a(n) = a + O\left(\frac 1n\right)$ does not say anything about the actual error in the n-th step because I do not know the constant $C\ge 0$. My solution: One may introduce a new notation, lets say the big Psi notation $\Psi(f(n))$ which is defined as $$g(n)\in \Psi(f(n)) \iff \limsup_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{g(n)}{f(n)}\right| < 1$$ For example one may write $$a(n) = a + \Psi\left(\frac{42}{n}\right)$$ so that $a(n)\in O\left(\frac 1n\right)$ with the constant $C=42$. There are also arithmetic rules for the big Psi notation similar to the rules for the big notation, for example: $$\left(1+\Psi\left(\frac an\right)\right)\left(1+\Psi\left(\frac bn\right)\right)\subseteq 1+\Psi\left(\frac{a+b+ab}{n}\right)$$ My question: Because the proposed solution is simple and somehow straightforward I guess there was already a mathematician who wrote about it. Can you point me to a textbook/paper where this notation is discussed, please? How is this notation called in mathematics? So far I have only found the big Omega notation and the big Theta notation ... Update: After rethinking the notation I would now define $$g(n)\in \Psi(f(n)) \iff \limsup_{n\to\infty} \left|\frac{g(n)}{f(n)}\right| \le 1$$ such that $$\left(1+\Psi\left(\frac an\right)\right)\left(1+\Psi\left(\frac bn\right)\right)\subseteq 1+\Psi\left(\frac{a+b}{n}\right)$$ because $$\limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{\frac{a+b}{n}}{\frac{a+b}{n}+\frac{ab}{n^2}} = 1$$","['calculus', 'definition', 'sequences-and-series', 'asymptotics', 'numerical-methods']"

I would also guess that addition/scalar multiplication are continuous since I thought every map from $X$ $\times$ $X$ to $X$ would be continuous, again by discreteness. The only issue is that I'm not sure I'm allowed to say that every set in $X$ $\times$ $X$ is open. I'm questioning even very basic things I thought I knew since my professor asked us to do this problem as an ""outside the box"" problem.

1413094,Iterated circumcenters - proving collinearity and establishing distance ratios,"Let $P_0, P_1, P_2$ be three points on the circumference of a circle with radius $1$, where $P_1P_2 = t < 2$. For each $i \ge 3$, define $P_i$ to be the centre of the circumcircle of $\triangle P_{i−1}P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. Prove that the points $P_1, P_5, P_9, P_13, \ldots$ are collinear. Let $x$ be the distance from $P_1$ to $P_{1001}$, and let $y$ be the distance from $P_{1001}$ to $P_{2001}$. Determine all values of $t$ for which $\sqrt[500]{\frac{x}{y}}$ is an integer. This question is from the 2001 Canada National Olympiad. Is there a cleaner way of solving the problem, using e.g. vectors, complex numbers, or some theorem, so that one does not need to take cues from such an accurate diagram? The diagram below (from GeoGebra) shows an example of a possible (converging) sequence of points. (It is possible for the points to diverge if $t$ is nearly zero or nearly diametral.) Note that every triangle other than possibly the initial one is isosceles, i.e. $$P_{i-2}P_{i}=P_{i-1}P_{i},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{1}$$ Since $P_i$ (for $i\ge3$) is equidistant from all of $P_{i−1},P_{i−2},P_{i−3}$, then $P_i$ must be on the perpendicular bisector of $P_{i−1}P_{i−2}$ and $P_{i−2}P_{i−3}$. So, if $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$ (as labeled for the $i=3$ example), then 
$$\beta=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha \tag{2}$$
This relationship can be applied inductively to all larger $i$ to show that:
$$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \sim \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{3}$$
and that 
$$\triangle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}} \perp \triangle{P_{i}P_{i+1}P_{i+2}},\qquad i\ge 3 \tag{4}$$
Also because triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two point, then side $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}$ is anti-parallel to side $P_{i+2}P_{i+3}$, i.e.
$$P_{i-2}P_{i-1} \parallel P_{i+3}P_{i+2},\qquad \tag{5}$$ As before, let $\angle{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}P_{i}}=\alpha,\angle{P_{i-1}P_{i}P_{i+1}}=\beta$, with $i\ge3$ odd, and let distance $P_{i-2}P_{i-1}=x$. Then 
$$\begin{align}
P_{i-1}P_{i}&=\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha \\[1em]
P_{i}P_{i+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x\sec\alpha\right)\sec{\beta}&=\frac{1}{4}x\,\sec\alpha\,\mathrm{cosec}\,\alpha \\
\end{align}$$
so
$$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=4\sin\alpha\cos\alpha=2\sin{2\alpha}=2\sin{2\beta}=4\sin\beta\cos\beta$$ From the problem definition, assuming WLOG that $\beta<\frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $\sin\beta=\frac{t}{2}$ and $\cos\beta=\frac{\sqrt{4-t^2}}{2}$ so that $$\frac{P_{i-2}P_{i-1}}{P_{i}P_{i+1}}=t\sqrt{4-t^2},\qquad i\ge3 \tag{6}$$ Applying (6) repeatedly: $$\frac{P_{i}P_{i+1}}{P_{i+2k}P_{i+2k+1}}=\left(t\sqrt{4-t^2}\right)^k,\qquad i\ge1,k\ge0 \tag{7}$$ Part 1 I'm not quite sure how to prove this rigorously. It's obvious that the next point in the sequence depends only on the previous three and nothing beyond this. So if triangles turn through $90^\circ$ every two points (and hence $180^\circ$ every four points) and are similar, then any four consecutive segments in the path are a translated, mirrored and scaled image of the next four segments in the path. Then $P_1,P_5,P_9,\ldots$ must be collinear. And $P_2,P_6,P_{10},\ldots$, etc. Should I formalise this e.g. by using vectors? Part 2 The path is a regular spiral (claimed), so by similarity arguments $$\frac{x}{y}=\frac{P_{1}P_{2}}{P_{1001}P_{1002}}=\left(t\sqrt{4-t^2}\right)^{500}$$
Therefore, for the ratio as a function of $t$:
$$f(t)=\sqrt[500]{\frac{x}{y}}=t\sqrt{4-t^2}$$
Since $f(t)$ has a maximum when $t=\sqrt2$ and $f(\sqrt2)=\sqrt2\sqrt{4-2}=2$, we immediately have one integer value at:
$$\boxed{t=\sqrt2}$$
So it remains to find $t$ at which $f(t)=1$. 
$$\begin{align}
t\sqrt{4-t^2}=1 \implies t^2(4-t^2)=1 &\implies t^4-4t^2+1=0 \implies t^2=2\pm\sqrt3
\end{align}$$ From $t^2=2+\sqrt3$ we get $\boxed{t=\dfrac{1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}}$ From $t^2=2-\sqrt3$ we get $\boxed{t=\dfrac{-1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}}$ Remark: If $\frac{1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}<t<2$ or $t<\frac{-1+\sqrt3}{\sqrt2}$, the sequence of points diverges ($f(t)<1$).","['contest-math', 'geometry', 'proof-verification', 'trigonometry']"

1413157,Law of Large Numbers - utility/difficulty of various versions.,"This may or may not be an answer to Is there an easy proof that the set of $x \in [0,1]$ whose limit of proportion of 1's in binary expansion of $x$ does not exist has measure zero? , depending on how easy a proof has to be to count as easy. The law of large numbers comes in various versions: LLN${}_p$ Suppose $X_1,\dots$ are iid with $\Bbb EX_1=0$ and $\Bbb E|X_1|^p<\infty$. Then $\frac1n(X_1+\dots+X_n)\to0$ almost surely. Proving LLN${}_1$ is considerably harder than proving LLN${}_2$. My impression is that this gives LLN${}_2$ a higher utility/difficulty ratio, since it suffices for many applications. Seems to me that LLN${}_4$ has yet a much higher utility/difficulty ratio. There's an awesomely easy proof of LLN${}_4$. The obligatory question then is this: Question Are there a lot of standard probability distributions out there, that actually come up, that give $\Bbb E X^4=\infty$ but $\Bbb E X^2<\infty$? Hoping for an answer to that question is why I'm posting this. The idea that people might be amused by the proof of LLN${}_4$ is absolutely no part of my motivation, I swear; that would not be a legal reason for this post's existence. Of course you need to see the proof I have in mind in order to evaluate that utility/difficulty ratio: Say $S_n = X_1+\dots+X_n$. Multiply out the product $S_n^4$:
$$S_n^4=\sum X_{j_1}X_{j_2}X_{j_3}X_{j_4}.$$Independence shows that most of those terms have mean $0$; the only terms with non-zero mean are of the form $X_j^4$ or a ""permutation"" of $X_j^2X_k^2$. A trivial bit of combinatorics shows then that $$\Bbb ES_n^4\le cn^2.$$ Monotone convergence shows that $$\Bbb E\left[\sum\left(\frac 1n S_n\right)^4\right]<\infty.$$Hence $\sum\left(\frac 1n S_n\right)^4<\infty$ almost surely, so $\frac1nS_n\to0$ almost surely.

1413222,What are super-translations?,"There's been a lot of news lately about a possible solution to the black hole information paradox from a presentation given by Stephen Hawking to the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm . Many of them mention the term super translation . This article , for example, states (with emphasis added): His flash of inspiration came when listening to a lecture in April
  about what are called super-translations , a bit of the heady
  branch of mathematics known as group theory. Dr Hawking thinks that
  incoming particles shed their information like a coat as they pass
  into a black hole, leaving it draped on the event horizon itself. Super-translations mathematically describe how that information influx can slightly jiggle the fabric of space at the horizon, in turn
  shifting around when and how the black hole radiates. What exactly are super-translations, mathematically? I have been trying to search for this term online, but the results are flooded with news articles. Where can I find some sources that describe super-translations in greater detail? EDIT: Another description of super-translations is provided in a recent article : The horizon of a black hole has the weird feature that it’s a sphere
  and it’s expanding outward at the speed of light. For every point on
  the sphere, there’s a light ray. So it’s composed of light rays. But
  it doesn’t get any bigger and that’s because of the force of gravity
  and the curvature of space. And, by the way, that’s why nothing that
  is inside a black hole can get out—because the boundary of the black
  hole itself is already moving at the speed of light. There’s this symmetry of a black hole that we all knew about in which
  you move uniformly forward and backward in time along all of the light
  rays. But there’s another symmetry, which is the new thing in this
  paper (though various forms of it have been discussed elsewhere). It’s
  a symmetry in which the individual light rays are moved up and down.
  See, individual light rays can’t talk to each other—if you’re riding
  on a light ray, causality prevents you from talking to somebody riding
  on an adjacent light ray. So these light rays are not tethered
  together. You can slide them up and down relative to one another. That
  sliding is called a super-translation. And in a way, it looks like you're not doing anything. Think of a
  bundle of infinitely long straws and you move one up and down relative
  to the other. Are you doing anything, or not? What we showed is that
  you are doing something. It turns out that adding a soft graviton has
  an alternate description as a super-translation in which you move some
  of these light rays back and forth relative to one another. That’s super-translations on black holes. Super-translations were
  introduced in the 1960s, and they were talking not about the light
  rays that comprise the boundary of spacetime at the horizon of a black
  hole but the light rays that comprise the boundary of spacetime out at
  infinity. The story started by analyzing those supertranslations.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'physics', 'mathematical-physics']"

If a function, $f(z)$, is continuous in simply connected domain, then it will be Riemann integrable and hence its antiderivitive, $F(z)$, will exist and moreover the antiderivative will be differentiable in the domain.

I am NOT after a proof of this fact; what I am curious about is whether there is a geometric argument for it. I am after the sort of intuition one gets from looking at linear transformations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and envisioning their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For example, it is very intuitively clear why nontrivial rotation matrices cannot have real eigenvectors. It is also geometrically clear why diagonal matrices have their eigenvalues equal to their diagonal elements. EDIT: Upon further thought, I have realized that a simple consequence of symmetry is that in the singular value decomposition of a matrix $M = U \Sigma V^*$, we have $U = V$. Thus requiring symmetry means that the linear transformation must be accomplished by performing a rotation, performing a scaling along the axes, and then reversing the original rotation . The missing piece for me is why defining a transformation via a symmetric matrix means that the transformation can be decomposed in this simple way.","['linear-algebra', 'intuition']"

We equate $\sigma(X)$ to our everyday term ""information"". Here, sigma-algebra generated by a random variable is defined as the following. Suppose $X:(\Omega,\cal{F}) \to$ $(E,\cal E)$, then the sigma-algebra generated by $X$ is $\sigma(X)=\sigma\{X^{-1}(A):A\in \cal E \}$, i.e. the sigma-algebra generated by $\{X^{-1}(A):A\in \cal E \}$. The following is my understanding with confusion. If we know the random variable $X$, which is a function mapping elements in $\Omega$ to $E$, then clearly we can determine $\sigma(X)$ by its definition. This direction is OK to me. For the other direction, if $\sigma(X)$ is known, then how $X$ is determined? For example, suppose $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}, E=\{0,1\}$ and $\sigma(X)=\{\emptyset,\Omega, A, A^C\}$ where $A=\{1,3,5\}$. Now it seems that we have two possibilities, $X(x) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}

1&{x \in {A^C}}

I don't understand why the following argument is true . Given two random variable $X,Y$ where $Y$ is $\cal F_0$ measurable and $\cal F_0$ is a sub $\sigma$-algebra of $\cal F$, then $\Bbb{E}(XY|\cal F_0)$$=Y\Bbb{E}(X|\cal F_0)$.

1413904,Show that the equation $\cos(\sin x)=\sin(\cos x)$ has no real solutions.,"The following problem was on a math competition that I participated in at my school about a month ago: Prove that the equation $\cos(\sin x)=\sin(\cos x)$ has no real solutions. I will outline my proof below.  I think it has some holes.  My approach to the problem was to say that the following equations must have real solution(s) if the above equation has solution(s): $$
\cos^2(\sin x)=\sin^2(\cos x)\\
1-\cos^2(\sin x)=1-\sin^2(\cos x)\\
\sin^2(\sin x)=\cos^2(\cos x)\\
\sin(\sin x)=\pm\cos(\cos x)\\
$$ I then proceeded to split into cases and use the identity $\cos t = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} \pm t\pm y2\pi)$ to get $$
\sin x=\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \cos x\pm y2\pi\\
$$ and the identity $-\cos t = \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}\pm t\pm y2\pi) $ to get $$
\sin x=- \frac{\pi}{2}\pm \cos x \pm y2\pi.\\
$$ where $y$ is any integer.  I argued that $y=0$ was the only value of $y$ that made any sense (since the values of sine and cosine remain between $-1$ and $1$).  Therefore, the above equations become $$
\sin x=\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \cos x\implies \sin x \pm \cos x=\frac{\pi}{2}\\
$$ and $$
\sin x=- \frac{\pi}{2}\pm \cos x\implies \cos x\pm\sin x= \frac{\pi}{2}.\\
$$ Then, by a short optimization argument, I showed that these last two equations have no real solutions. First, does this proof make sense?  Second, if my proof makes sense, then I feel that it was not very elegant nor simple.  Is my approach the best, or is there a better (i.e., more elegant, shorter, simpler) proof?","['problem-solving', 'trigonometry']"
1413909,Stellating the Octahedron,"I have a few related questions and I'd be happy to get some help with any one of them. Is the stellation of a polyhedron generally a 'messy' affair that involves trimming away portions of the enlarged faces? (See below for my implicit assumption, $\text{stellation} \cong \text{dilation},$ that is probably wrong, I see now) Are there any polyhedral stellations that come from simply dilating the faces , no trimming necessary? Is there a good reference that explicitly defines stellation? I use truncation often but have gotten by with intuition, but this is not the case with stellation. Context: I am trying to create a very primitive animation/demonstration that shows the stellation of an octahedron to yield the stella octangula. Unfortunately, it seems that the mental image I have for stellation isn't living up to the real thing. I've always thought that one simply dilates each face, since this is what happens to the star polygons. Quoting Coxeter ( Regular Polytopes , section 6.2 on Polyhedra Stellation), it appears this is not necessarily the case: In order to stellate a Polyhedron, we have to extend its faces symmetrically until they again form a polyhedron. At any rate, I started with the stately octahedron, shown here using the software Grapher for OSX (I prefer the faces colored uniformly, but it defaults to checkerboard every time I scale). Now I start to scale each face about its center; this image shows each face scaled by a factor of $2$ . I'm noticing the triangular 'hole' starting to close up in the NorthEast region, for example. Here it is scaled by a factor of $4$ , where the three planes bounding the previous triangular 'hole' have finally met at a point. And here's a closeup near the three planes meeting at that point, with the 'hole' finally closed. In the last image I think I can see the stella octangula hiding underneath, but the there are many portions of the enlarged faces that need to be thrown away. I only have hands-on experience stellating regular polygons, by extending the edges, to produce star polygons . In that case, it's just a matter of finding the right scale factors for the edges with no trimming required. My goal was for an expository lecture to non math-majors, but that animation is shaping up to be far too complicated.","['polyhedra', 'visualization', 'solid-geometry', 'geometry']"

1414019,"Difference between the ""Hazard Rate"" and the ""Killing Function"" of a diffusion model?","I posted this question on Cross Validated - but I think it applies here too. Also, it increases the chances of the question being answered. Link here If this is not acceptable - administrators please delete, and anybody else please do not take points away from me for this reason. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What is the difference between the ""Hazard Rate"" and the ""Killing Function"" of a diffusion model? Some Definitions: The Killing Function The function k(t,x) is interpreted as the killing rate. Informally, this means that if, at time t , the particle is alive and is situated at the point x , then the probability that it dies in the next h units of time is approximately k(t,x)h when h is small. \begin{gather*}
Pr(\rho  \leq t+h \mid \rho  > t, X(t) = x)\approx k(t, x)h & (1)
\end{gather*} And, \begin{gather*}
dX(t) = \mu dt+\sigma dW\ & (2)
\end{gather*} Hazard Rate \begin{gather*}
Pr(t \leq T \leq t+h \mid T > t) \approx \lambda (t)h & (3)
\end{gather*} That is, λ(t)h represents the instantaneous chance that an individual will die in the interval (t, t + h) given that this individual is alive at age t . Lastly, to put it in perspective here is a picture of a diffusion with arbitrary Killing Function k(x) = a + Sqrt(t/b) , where a, and b are some constants. I added the lines for later reference. So, these results raise a lot more question. How do I interpret ""rho"" in Equation (1) for example - if I am modeling a type of bird population for with X(t) ? How do I relate the Killing Function with the Hazard Rate? Is it OK to say that if the f(t) is the density distribution of the First-Passage-Times (Refer to Fig-2), then the Hazard rate for the diffusion (2) is: \begin{gather*}
\lambda (t) = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} & (4)
\end{gather*} If I do not know the killing function - but I observe the first passage time distribution as in Fig-2: Is it possible to solve for the Killing Function? Lastly, in the definition k(t,x) is a function of both variables { x,t }. In the literature, most of the time is referred as k(x) , which is really k(X(t)) since X() is a function of t . But if one was to actually apply it - as I did in Fig-1, say: \begin{gather*}
k(x) = b[(x(t)-a)^{2}]\ & (5)
\end{gather*} I would have to express it in terms of X(t) : \begin{gather*}
X(t) = a+\sqrt{\frac{t}{b}} & (6)
\end{gather*} But X(t) is reserved for the diffusion model (2) so it makes it extra confusing.

Evaluate $$I=\int_{0}^{1}\log{(x)}\log{(1-x)}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ Feel free to take a moment to try to solve this yourself, if you have never seen it before. My answer is as follows. In the interval $(0,1)$, we may expand $\log{(1-x)}$ as a power series: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\log{(1-x)} & = & -\left(x+\frac{x^{2}}{2}+\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\ldots+\frac{x^{r}}{r}+\ldots\right)\\
& = & -\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k}
\end{eqnarray*} Now for any $p\in\mathbb{N}$, using integration by parts we see that $$\int_{0}^{1}x^{p}\log{x}\,\mathrm{d}x = -\frac{1}{(p+1)^{2}}.$$ Combining the above results, we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{0}^{1}\log{(x)}\log{(1-x)}\,\mathrm{d}x & = & \int_{0}^{1}\log{(x)}\left[-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k}\right]\,\mathrm{d}x\\
& = & -\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\left[\int_{0}^{1}x^{k}\log{x}\,\mathrm{d}x\right]\\
& = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k(k+1)^{2}}\\
& = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{k(k+1)}-\frac{1}{(k+1)^{2}}\right]\\
& = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k(k+1)}-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(k+1)^{2}}\\
& = & 1-(\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}-1)\\
& = & 2-\frac{\pi^{2}}{6},
\end{eqnarray*}
where we have evaluated one of the two series at the end via a telescoping sum, the details of which I have left out, and the value of the other series is well-known. I found the result surprising. I performed a small sanity check by attempting to sketch the graph within the interval; Wolfram|Alpha agrees with my sketch and agrees with my answer, but, to me at least, this information is uninformative about why the result is true. To be more precise, I don't understand how or why the answer relates to the original elements of the question. My question : Is there any reason why one would expect $\pi$ to appear in this answer? Is there some tricky change of variables or some unbeknownst-to-me complex analysis way of evaluating this integral which sheds more light on the relation between it and $\zeta(2)$? With this in mind, I should also be precise about what I am accepting as an answer: T's & C's : If no such ""deeper relation"" between question and answer is apparent to anyone at all , then I will accept ""it's just a coincidence"" as an answer. If a connection is apparent to somebody, but it involves mathematics that you fear may be beyond me, feel free to post it anyway if you wish, and I'll do my best to understand what you've said.

More precisely, by using the two following definitions for a general ring $A$ Definition 1 A $n\times n$ -matrix $M$ with coefficients in the ring A is semisimple if $A^n$ is a semi-simple $A[M]$ -module (here I am using the definition provided in the answer of @ಠ_ಠ below) Definition 2 A separable polynomial $P$ of $A[X]$ is a polynomial whose discriminant is invertible in $A$ Then is the following statement true? A matrix $M$ over $A$ have a unique Jordan-Chevalley decomposition if its characteristic polynomial divides a power of a separable polynomial. Edit By Jordan decomposition I mean here the additive one, i.e. there exist $M_s$ and $M_n$ , two $n\times n$ $A$ -matrices respectively semi-simple and nilpotent, such that $$M=M_s+M_n$$ If it is not, what kind of general property should the ring $A$ have to make it true (like $A$ is a domain, etc.) Edit 2 I believe my definition 1 is equivalent in a domain to the fact that the matrix is diagonalizable in an algebraic extension of the fraction field which is equivalent to the fact that the matrix is cancelled by a separable polynomial (definition 2) in $A[X]$","['linear-algebra', 'matrix-decomposition', 'commutative-algebra']"

1414223,Differentiation under the integral sign when derivative exists only almost everywhere,"Regarding the Theorem 3 from here (or pdf ver. ). Let $X$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ , and $\Omega$ be a measure space. Suppose that a function $f\colon X\times\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the following conditions: $f(x,\omega)$ is a measurable function of $x$ and $\omega$ jointly, and is integrable over $\omega$ ,  for almost all $x\in X$ held fixed. For almost all $\omega\in\Omega$ , $f(x,\omega)$ is an absolutely continuous function of $x$ . (This guarantees that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,\omega)$ exists almost everywhere.) $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,\omega)$ is ""locally integrable"" --- that is, for all compact intervals $[a,b]\subset X$ : $$
\int_a^b\!\!\int_{\Omega}\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,\omega) \right| d\omega dx<\infty.
$$ Then, $\int_\Omega f(x,\omega)d\omega$ is an absolutely continuous function of $x$ , and for almost every $x\in X$ , its derivatives exists and is given by $$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_{\Omega}f(x,\omega)d\omega
=
\int_{\Omega}\frac{d}{dx}f(x,\omega)d\omega.
$$ Question 1: I do not see how to show $\int_\Omega f(x,\omega)d\omega$ is absolutely continuous in $x$ . Question 2: I also wonder where I can find this result preferably in a book or a paper etc. ==================================================== Here is my thought:
Notations basically follow the plametmath note by Steven Cheng (the link above). Let $(\Omega,\mu)$ be the measure space and $(a,b):=X\subset\mathbb{R}$ . For $\mu$ -almost all $\omega\in \Omega$ , we assumed that $f(\cdot,\omega)$ is an absolutely continuous function in the first variable. Hence for a.e.- $x$ we have \begin{align}
f(x,\omega)&=f(a,\omega)+\int_{a}^x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y,\omega)\,dy
\end{align} Letting $G(x):=\int_{a}^x\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y,\omega)\,
d\mu(\omega ){d}y$ and $g(x):=\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,\omega)\,
d\mu(\omega )$ by virtue of Lebesgue differentiation theorem for the indefinite integral, for a.e. $x$ we have \begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,\omega)d\mu(\omega )
&=g(x)=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}G(x)
=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\int_{\Omega}\int_{a}^x
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y,\omega)\,
dyd\mu(\omega ).
\end{align} where the last equality is ok from the assumption $
\int_{\Omega}\int_{a}^x\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
	f(y,\omega)\right|
\,dyd\mu(\omega )
	<\infty
$ . Adding $0=\frac{d}{d  t}\int_{\Omega}f(a,\omega)d\mu(\omega )$ to the above yields \begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,\omega)d\mu(\omega )
&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\int_{\Omega}\left\{
\int_{a}^x
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y,\omega)\,
dy+f(a,\omega)\right\}d\mu(\omega )
\right)\\
&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\int_{\Omega}
f(x,\omega)d\mu(\omega ).
\end{align} I think the RHS exists for almost every $x$ because LHS does, which is the second claim of Theorem 3. I am not sure if I can immediately say $\int_\Omega f(x,\omega)d\omega$ is AC in $x$ , which is the first claim of 3., Theorem 3.","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'solution-verification', 'real-analysis', 'reference-request']"

It suffices to prove that if the sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are such that $X \supset Y \supset Z$ and $\operatorname{card} X=\operatorname{card} Z$, then $\operatorname{card} X=\operatorname{card} Y$. Let $f : X \rightarrow Z$ be a bijection. A bijection $g : X \rightarrow Y$ can be defined, for example, as follows: $$

1414246,Every ordered field that has the least upper bound property is isomorphic to the real number system.,"Okay, so here's a theorem from Rudin: ""Every ordered field that has the least upper bound property is
isomorphic to the real number system."" Here's a definition: ""Ordered fields are isomorphic if there is a bijection between the underlying sets that preserves the field operations and the orders."" i.e. Ordered fields (F, +, ·, ≤) and (K, ⊕, ⊙, ≼) are isomorphic if there exists a bijection h : F → K such that
 (a) for all x,y ∈ F, h(x+y)=h(x)⊕h(y), 
 (b) for all x,y ∈ F, h(x·y)=h(x)⊙h(y), and 
 (c) for all x,y ∈ F, if x≤y,then h(x)≼h(y). Here are some things that I think are true: 1.) The field T with two elements {0, 1} is an ordered field that has the least upper bound property. Because T is finite, every nonempty subset of T has a maximum. Max(T) = LUB(T) for all subsets of T that have a maximum element. Therefore all subsets of T have a least upper bound in T. Thus T has the least upper bound property. 2.) Since T has the LUB property, it is isomorphic to the real # system and therefore there exists a bijection between the real numbers and {0, 1}. 3.) ...but since {0, 1} is finite and the real numbers are infinite, there can be no surjection from {0,1} -> real numbers. Therefore there's no bijection between the reals and {0, 1}. So... Which thing that I think is true is not actually true? Thanks!","['ordered-fields', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

1414563,Divergence based robust inference,"The term 'divergence' means a function $D$ which takes two probability distributions $g,f$ as input and puts out a non-negative real number $D(g,f)$. I have learnt that the inference based on minimizing the following divergence is robust against those data points which are not compatible with the assumed model (called outliers ), for some specific range of $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n$. $$D_{\alpha}(g,f) = \frac{1}{\alpha-1}\log \int g^{\alpha}f^{1-\alpha}~dx,$$ where $g$ stands for the data driven density and $f$ stands for the model density (see, for example here ). There are several names to this $D_\alpha$ in the literature viz., Renyi divergence, power divergence, $\alpha$-divergence etc. Can someone give a justification of how this method is robust? Update: (as suggested by  @Bruce Trumbo) Some Preliminaries: Suppose that $x_1,\dots,x_n$ i.i.d. samples drawn according to a particular member of a parametric family of probability distributions $\mathcal{F} = \{f_\theta\}$ ( model ). (Let us assume, for simplicity, that the $f_{\theta}$'s have a common support set $\mathbb{X}$ which is finite and also that $\mathbb{X}$ is the undelying sample space.) Our objective is to choose a special member $f_{\theta^*}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ which ""best"" explains the observed samples. The Maximum Liklihood Estimate (MLE) is a widely used inference method which asks us to choose the $f_\theta$ for which $\Pi_{i=1}^n f_\theta(x_i)$ is maximum. Let $\hat{f}$ be the empirical measure of the $x_i$'s. Then observe that
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n f_\theta(x_i)}{\prod_{i=1}^n \hat{f}(x_i)} & = & \prod_{x\in\mathbb{X}} \left(\frac{f_\theta(x)}{\hat{f}(x)}\right)^{n\hat{f}(x)}\\
& = &\exp\{-nD(\hat{f}\|f_\theta)\},
\end{eqnarray}
where $D(\hat{f}\|f_\theta)=\sum_x \hat{f}(x)\log(\hat{f}(x)/f_\theta(x))$ is the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence. Hence, MLE is a minimizer of $D(\hat{f}\|f_\theta)$ over $\theta$. For minimization, $(\partial/\partial_\theta) D(\hat{f}\|f_\theta) = 0$. This implies $$\sum_{x\in \mathbb{X}} \hat{f}(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f_\theta(x) = 0.$$
That is, $$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f_\theta(x_i) = 0,$$ called the score equation . Thus, one needs to solve the score equation for finding the MLE. However, MLE is not robust when few of the $x_i$ are outliers. The inference based on minimizing the power divergence is known to be robust against the outliers. Note that the power divergence $D_\alpha(\cdot\|\cdot)\to D(\cdot\|\cdot)$ as $\alpha\to 1$. I roughly remember that the ""improved"" (or generalized) score equation corresponding to the power divergence to be something like
$$\sum_{i=1}^n f_{\theta}(x_i)^c\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\log f_\theta(x_i) = 0,$$ for some $c>0$, potentially a function of $\alpha$. The thing I would like to know is whether there is any way by which this generalized score equation can be shown to be derived from the power divergence as in the case of MLE as the score equation is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
