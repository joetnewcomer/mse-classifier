601384,Show that the Kelvin-transform is harmonic,"First, I have to give you our definitions: Consider $\Omega:=\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\overline{B}_R(0)$ with $R>0$ and $n>1$. The function $\phi\colon\Omega\to G:=B_R(0)\setminus\left\{0\right\}$ with
$$
y=\phi(x):=\frac{R^2}{\| x\|^2}x\text{  for  }\| x\|>R
$$
is called Kelvin-transformation (relating to the sphere $S_R(0)$) . Let $u\colon\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. The function defined by
$$
v(y):=\frac{\| x\|^{n-2}}{R^{n-2}}u(x)\text{  for  }\lVert x\rVert >R~~~(*)
$$
is called Kelvin-transform of u . Alternatively, the Kelvin-transform of $u$ can be definied by
$$
v(z):=\frac{R^{n-2}}{\lVert z\rVert^{n-2}}u\left(\frac{R^2}{\lVert z\rVert^2}z\right)\text{  for  }\lVert z\rVert <R.
$$ Let $u$ be harmonic in $\Omega$. Then its Kelvin-transform is harmonic in $G$. Show that for the case $n=2$. To be honest, I do not know, what is to show here, because if I take the alternative definition of the Kelvin-transform, for $n=2$ it is
$$
v(z)=u\left(\frac{R^2}{\lVert z\rVert^2}z\right), z\in G
$$
and then
$$
\Delta v(z)=\Delta u\left(\frac{R^2}{\lVert z\rVert^2}z\right)=0,
$$
because $x:=\frac{R^2}{\lVert z\rVert^2}z$ is in $\Omega$ and $u$ is harmonic in $\Omega$. So I only had to use that the inverse of the Kelvin-transformation is given by
$$
\phi^{-1}\colon G\to\Omega, y\longmapsto\frac{R^2}{\lVert y\rVert^2}y.
$$ Is that the proof? It seems TOO easy...","['harmonic-functions', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

601447,Proving conservation of mass for linear advection,"Reading through some course notes about conservation of mass in linear advection approximation schemes, given $\phi(x, t) \in \mathbb{R}$ and is defined for $0 \leq x < 1$ with periodic boundary conditions, and given mass $M = \int_0^1{\phi dx}$ the proof begins as follows: $$\frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \int_0^1 \phi dx = \int_0^1 {\frac{d\phi}{dt} dx} $$ A couple of questions: How can we justify moving $\frac{d}{dt}$ inside the integral? Shouldn't this now be a partial differential $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ since $\phi$ is a function of space ($x$) and time ($t$)? The proof continues:
$$-u \int_0^1\frac{d\phi}{dx}dx = -u \int_0^1 d \phi = -u \left[ \phi \right]_0^1 = 0$$
since $\phi(0, t) = \phi(1, t) \forall t$ due to the periodic boundary.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"

Then the intersection, $D=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} D_n\ $ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ . My question: Isn't any dense open set in $\mathbb{R}$ equal to $\mathbb{R}$ ?
I mean, that $U$ is dense means that, for every open interval $(a,b)$ , $U\cap(a,b)\neq\emptyset$ . Furthermore, that $U$ is open means that every point is an interior point. So, isn't $U$ just a union of open intervals which equals $\mathbb{R}$ ?

Prove that there is a real number $r$ such that $r \not \in f_n(F)$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$ My attempt at a solution: I am not so sure how to attack this problem, I suppose that it may be easier to prove it by the absurd or by the contrapositive. So, suppose that for all $r \in \mathbb R$, $r \in \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} f_n(F)$.This means $\mathbb R=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} f_n(F)$ Now, I would like to construct a sequence of real numbers $\{y_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N}$ such that $y_n \to z$ where $f^{-1}_n(y_n) \in F$ and $f^{-1}_{n_0}(z)=q$, for some natural number $n_0$ with $q \in \mathbb Q$.

The numerical values I obtain are finite. The integrand has an integrable singularity at $p=p_0$ due to the ${\rm ln}$, but no singularity at $p=q$ due to the presence of the numerator.

and specifies the assumptions on the variables properly. $\epsilon$ can be sent to zero after the integration. It is also possible to evaluate the original integral if the exponential is dropped and a small epsilon is introduced.

  $$\wp^R(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{0<|w|<R}

 \left[\frac{1}{(z+w)^2}-\frac{1}{w^2}\right]$ is $O(1/|w|^3)$ (uniformly) so defines a holomorphic function in $|z|<R$. But is the above hint also correct? $O(1/R)$ is ambiguous and restriction of $z$ seems to needed. So if I understood $\wp^R(z)$ as $$\wp^R(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{0<|w|<2R}
 \left[\frac{1}{(z+w)^2}-\frac{1}{w^2}\right] \quad (|z|<R)$$ But still don't know how to compare $\wp^R(z+1)-\wp^R(z)$. What should I do?","['elliptic-functions', 'complex-analysis']"

I am obviously not going to buy all these books at once and this list is by no means set in stone and is subject to change. Another reason that I want to get a deeper understanding of these subjects is because I feel like my lack of depth is what hindered me in my linear algebra class this semester, I did okay overall but I had hard time because the book used a lot of notation and symbols with stuff that I didn't know.

602024,Distribution of Difference of Independent Random Variables,"Usually in the development of the theory of Brownian motion, one makes the assumption that $X_t$ (the coordinate functions on $(\mathbb{R}^*)^{[0,\infty)}$). have normal distributions with mean $0$ with variance $s$ and that the distribution of $X_t - X_s$ is normal as well with mean $0$ and variance $t-s.$ See, e.g., $\S$10.5 of Folland. The standard mathematical model for this is the Wiener process, and by the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem, it is possible to construct a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{B}, P)$ with the joint distribution of $X_{t_1}, \ldots, X_{t_n}$ being exactly the prescribed normal distribution, namely $$\mathrm{d}P_{t_1,\ldots,t_n} = \left[\prod_{j=1}^{n} 2\pi (t_j-t_{j-1})\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}-\frac{(x_j-x_{j-1})^2}{2(t_j-t_{j-1}}\right) \mathrm{d}x_1\ldots\mathrm{d}x_n,$$
where $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \ldots < t_n,$ and $\mathrm{d}x_1\ldots\mathrm{d}x_n$ is $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Note that because the coordinate functions are independent, the left hand side is the same as the product measure of the individual distributions. Given this, my professor showed that $X_t - X_s$ has distribution $(2\pi(t-s))^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\tfrac{x^2}{2(t-s)}\right)\mathrm{d}x$ by considering the linear transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $T(y_1,y_2) = (y_1, y_1+y_2),$ which in particular has determinant $1.$ The main point of the argument was that this transformation also affects the distribution in the same manner, so that the joint distributions of $(X_s, X_t)$ and $(X_s, X_t - X_s)$ can be derived from each other. My question is if someone could supply the details of this argument. In my notes, I have something with differential forms and pushforwards, but it's really not clear to me.

There is an increasing sequence of open sets $U_n$ with $\bigcup_n U_n = M$ and smooth, compactly supported functions $\phi_n : M \to [0,1]$ such that $\phi_n = 1$ on $U_n$ and $\sup_n |\nabla \phi_n| < \infty$. This is trivial if $M$ is compact (take $U_n = M$ and $\phi_n = 1$).  If we drop the requirement that the derivatives of $\phi_n$ be uniformly bounded, it's a consequence of the $\sigma$-compactness of $M$ and Urysohn's lemma.  Also, the completeness is essential as we can see by taking $M$ to be an open interval.

602490,Mysterious inconsistency in an inhomogeneous linear 2nd order ODE with specified boundary values,"I am trying to solve $$J''(\tau) = h (J - B) \tag{1} $$ where $h$ is a positive real constant and $B$ is a real-valued, smooth and otherwise well-behaved function for $\tau \in (0, \infty)$. I have the boundary conditions $$J(0) = 0 \\ \lim_{\tau \to \infty} J = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} B \equiv B_{\infty}  \tag{2}$$
 I'm using this equation in a physical model, and I have reason to expect $B_\infty$ to be positive (nonzero). Here's my attempt at a solution: A solution basis for the homogeneous equation is $J_1 = e^{\sqrt{h} \tau}$ and $J_2 = e^{-\sqrt{h} \tau}$. The Wronskian evaluates to $-2\sqrt{h}$, a constant. Then I use variation of parameters to write the general solution as $$J = e^{\sqrt{h} \tau}\left[\int_{\tau}^{\infty} \frac{h \,B(s)}{2\sqrt{h}} e^{-\sqrt{h} s}ds + C_1\right] +e^{-\sqrt{h} \tau}\left[\int_0^{\tau} \frac{h \,B(s)}{2\sqrt{h}} e^{\sqrt{h} s}ds + C_2\right] \tag{3}$$ I have tried my best to get the signs right above, although there's still a chance I got it wrong, so please let me know if you spot something that's not quite right. In the first integral, I put $\tau$ as the lower limit, which canceled a minus sign out front. And the minus signs in the Wronskians cancel with the minus signs in front of $h B$. To prevent the solution from diverging as $\tau \to \infty$, $C_1$ must be zero. I have been able to use the $\tau = 0$ boundary condition to derive an expression for $C_2$. But here's the problem. Consider once again the $\tau \to \infty$ boundary condition. If I plug in $C_1 = 0$ into the general solution (equation 3 above), and drop all terms that clearly vanish, I am left with $$\lim_{\tau \to \infty} J = \lim_{\tau \to \infty} e^{-\sqrt{h} \tau} \int_0^{\tau} \frac{h \,B(s)}{2\sqrt{h}} e^{\sqrt{h} s}ds \tag{4}$$ Then, using L'Hospital's rule, $$\lim_{\tau \to \infty} J = \frac{\frac{h \,B(\tau)}{2\sqrt{h}} e^{\sqrt{h} \tau}}{\sqrt{h} e^{\sqrt{h} \tau}} \tag{5} $$ which simplifies to $$ \lim_{\tau \to \infty} J = \frac{1}{2} \lim_{\tau \to \infty} B \tag{6} $$ It seems that the only way that the second boundary condition (second line of equation 2) can be satisfied is if $B_{\infty} = 0$. But as I noted above, on physical grounds I expect $B_{\infty} = 0$ to be able to take arbitrary positive values. Have I done something wrong, or is it really the case that $B_{\infty}$ must equal zero in this situation?","['boundary-value-problem', 'improper-integrals', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'limits']"

The first part was to show the density of the kernel in the case the real-valued linear functional from a Banach space is discontinuous, which has been discussed elsewhere on this forum.  If the linear function is continuous then the kernel separates its negative values from its positive values, so then the complement of the kernel is not path connected, so the answer depends crucially on the fact that the functional is discontinuous.  If a point is in the kernel then the ray through that point is in the kernel.

But $f \ne 0$ in some neighbourhood of $x = 0$ and therefore $f$ is not analytic.

603026,Is a bijective homotopy equivalence with bijective homotopy inverse a homeomorphism?,"I've been thinking about this for a while, but didn't get very far. Maybe someone here can say something about it. I know of an example of two spaces $X, Y$ with continuous bijections in both directions. Namely, define $X=Y=\Bbb Z\times\{0,1\}$. We define the basis for $X$ to consist of the sets
$$\{(-n,0)\},\ \ \{(-n,1)\},\ \ \{(0,0)\},\ \ \{(0,0),(0,1)\},\ \ \{(n,0),(n,1)\}$$ The basis for $Y$ will be
$$\{(-n,0)\},\ \ \{(-n,1)\},\ \ \{(0,0),(0,1)\},\ \ \{(n,0),(n,1)\}$$
Here $n>0$ in both definitions. Now let $f:X\to Y$ be the map $(n,i)\mapsto(n,i)$. Since the topology on $X$ is finer than that on $Y$, it is continuous. Define $g:Y\to X$ sending $(n,i)$ to $(n+1,i)$. Then both $f$ and $g$ are continuous bijections. However $g$ is not a homotopy equivalence. In fact, the only homotopy inverse of $f$ must map $\{(0,0),(0,1)\}$ to $(0,0)$, so it cannot be bijective.  Since such a map exists, $f$ is indeed a homotopy equivalence. The above example can be generalized: If $(X,\tau)$ is a non-indiscrete space which deformation retracts to a point $a$, $r:X\to\{a\}$ is the retraction and $i:\{a\}\to X$ the inclusion, then the identity map $(X,\tau)\to (X,\tau_{in})$ is a bijective homotopy equivalence with inverse $is$ where $s:(X,\tau_{in})\to\{a\}$. So the question is If $f:X\to Y$ is a bijective homotopy equivalence with a bijective homotopy inverse $g$, is $f$ a homeomorphism?","['general-topology', 'homotopy-theory']"

I have to take some function whose derivative at $0$ has to be zero. for simplicity I would take $f(x)=x^2$ Then I would get : $g(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ which is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}^2$ This would suggest me that second option has more chances as $f(0)=0$ in this case.

So, It is now got confirmed that i have to work out to ""Prove"" that first option is correct. Now, I have to prove that $g(x,y)=f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$ is differentiable.

As $f'$ and $\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ are continuous So is the product $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}=f'(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}).\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ As $f'$ and $\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ are continuous So is the product $\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}=f'(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}).\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ So we have continuous partial derivatives for $g(x,y)$.. So, I am willing to conclude that: $g(x,y)$ is  differentiable on $\mathbb{R}^2$ I would be thankful if some one can confirm if the answer correct. I would be much more thankful if some one can let me know if there are any gaps in my argument. This is just a proof verification Question..

\sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_{-n}(z-z_0)^{-n}
\end{align*}
  converge for all $z$ such that $r < |z-z_0| < R$, where
  \begin{align*}
r = \limsup |a_{-n}|^{1/n}, \quad R^{-1} = \limsup |a_n|^{1/n},
\end{align*}
  with $0 \le r$, $R \le \infty$. I already tried the ratio test, but I didn't find the limit to be $<1$ and also with comparison test I didn't reach a result.
Maybe there is another approach which I don't know.
I wanted to prove the convergence for both parts of the series, because if both parts converge, then also the whole Laurent series. Thanks.","['laurent-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'complex-analysis', 'taylor-expansion']"
603237,1-form on $S^n$ with non-degenerate differential.,"How it can be solved?
Whether there is a $1$-differential form $w$ on $S^n$, such that $dw$ is non-degenerate on $T_aS^n$ for each $a \in S^n$?","['differential-forms', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
603240,"Is the subset $[0,1)$ of $\mathbb{R}$ compact in the lower limit topology?","What I have done so far is give a contradiction, namely the cover: $\mathcal{U}=\{{[0,1-\frac{1}{n}):n\in\mathbb{N}}\}$ Because $\cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}[0,1-\frac{1}{n})=[0,1)$, it means that there is no finite subcover that covers $[0,1)$. Is this right or am I doing something wrong$?$ For some reason I have a feeling it is compact and I am overseeing something.",['general-topology']
603262,Is this relation an equivalence relation? Check my solution please.,"Define a relation R on the set {$2, 3, 4, ... $}, as follows. $(x, y)$ ∈ R if and only if $x$ and $y$ have a common factor greater than $1$. Is this relation reflexive? Is it symmetric? Is it transitive? Is this an equivalence relation? Justify your arguments. My Attempt: 1) It is reflexive, since the set begins at $2$ and $(x,x)$ will always be a common factor of itself, which is greater than $1$. 2)It is symmetric, because order doesn't matter. (I do not know how I should show this formally though) 3) Not transitive as $(2,6)$ and $(6,9)$ have GCF's $> 1$ but $(2,9)$ does not. Therefore this is not an equivalence relation.","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
603276,Volume of neighborhood of the curve,"Let $\gamma:[0,1] \to \mathbb R^n$ be a smooth closed curve, such that $\gamma(0)=\gamma(1), \gamma'(0)=\gamma'(1), |\gamma'(a)|=1$ and let $B_r=\{x| \exists t, |\gamma(t)-x|<r\}$. How can i show that the volume of $B_r$ is equal to $br^{(n-1)}$ for $r <\varepsilon$ for some $\varepsilon>0$. And how can I find $b$? It is intuitively obvious. But how can one prove it? I have no idea.","['multivariable-calculus', 'manifolds', 'volume', 'differential-geometry']"
