784832,Algebra of pseudo-differential operators,"The class of pseudod-ifferential operators form an associative algebra of Fourier integral operators. Moreover, given symbols $a,b,c\in C^\infty$ (each associated to some pseudo differential operator), for the composition of symbols (#) there holds: $$\text{op}(a)\circ \text{op}(b) = \text{op}(a\# b),$$ so, obviously, $\#$ should be an associative operation as well. The latter is equivalent to prove for $$(a \# b)(x,y)=\sum_{|\alpha|\geq 0} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \partial_y^\alpha a(x,y) D_x^\alpha b(x,y)\quad (1)$$ there holds $(a\#b)\# c = a\#(b\# c)$, where $D=-i\partial$. To check this, I first defined $\circ_N$ which considers in $(1)$ only the multi-indexes up to length $N$, i.e. $$(a \circ_N b)(x,y)=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq N} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \partial_y^\alpha a(x,y) D_x^\alpha b(x,y).$$ Now, using the general Leibniz product rule I get $$LS := (a\circ_N b) \circ_N c = \sum_{|\alpha|\leq N} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \partial_\xi^\alpha (\sum_{|\beta|\leq N}) \partial_\xi^\beta a D_x^\beta b) D_x^\alpha c = \sum_{|\alpha|\leq N,\ |\beta|\leq N,\ \alpha_1+\alpha_2=\alpha} \frac{1} {\beta!\alpha_1!\alpha_2!} (\partial_\xi^{\alpha_1+\beta} a) (\partial_\xi^{\alpha_2}D_x^\beta b) (D_x^\alpha c).$$ Similarly, we see $$RS := a \circ_N (b\circ_N c) = \sum_{|\alpha|\leq N,\ |\beta|\leq N,\ \alpha_1+\alpha_2=\alpha} \frac{1} {\beta!\alpha_1!\alpha_2!} (\partial_\xi^\alpha a) (\partial_\xi^{\beta}D_x^{\alpha_2} b) (D_x^{\alpha_1+\beta} c).$$ But unfortunately it is $LS\neq RS$; the larger $N$, the more different terms arise on each side and they will never cancel.

784888,Apparent paradox for the bird traveling between two trains puzzle,"Trying the ""hard solution"" for the puzzle below (which has been
discussed, with a different angle, elsewhere on this forum)
I got to a point where I have three seemingly valid solutions, and two do not match. I have checked the procedure several times, both by hand and with Maxima, and it appears correct - but I am obviously missing something.I cannot sort this out, maybe someone here can. (Sorry for the ASCII math, I am not MathJax-enabled) The story and the puzzle: A colleague approached one day John Von Neumann with a puzzle that had
two paths to a solution, a laborious, complicated calculation and an
elegant, Aha!-type solution. This colleague had a theory: in such a
case, mathematicians work out the laborious solution while the
(lazier, but smarter) physicists pause and find the quick-and-easy
solution. Which solution would von Neumann find? You know the sort of
puzzle: Two trains, 100 miles apart, are approaching each other on the
same track, one going 30 miles per hour, the other going 20 miles per
hour. A bird flying 120 miles per hour starts at train A (when they
are 100 miles apart), flies to train B, turns around and flies back to
the approaching train A, and so forth, until the two trains
collide. How far has the bird flown when the collision occurs? “Two
hundred and forty miles,” von Neumann answered almost
instantly. “Darn,” replied his colleague, “I predicted you’d do it the
hard way, summing the infinite series.” “Ay!” von Neumann cried in
embarrassment, smiting his forehead. “There’s an easy way!” Solution 1  - Easy: The trains will collide in $T_t=\frac{D_0}{V_1+V_2}$ . Hence $D_b=V_b\cdot\frac{D_0}{V_1+V_2}=120\cdot\frac{100}{50}=240$ Hard Solution preliminary: On the first leg, the bird travels the distance $D_0$ in time $T_0=\frac{D_0}{V_b+V_2}$ ; On the second leg, distance and duration amount to: $D_1 = D_0-T_0 \cdot (V_1+V_2) = D_0 \cdot \frac{V_b-V_1}{V_b+V_2}; T_1=D_0 \cdot \frac{V_1-V_b}{V_1+V_b}*(V_2+V_b))=T_0 \cdot \frac{V_b-V_1}{V_b+V_1}$ On the third leg,  a recurrence emerges: $D_2 = D_0 \cdot \frac{(V_1-V_b)\cdot(V_2-V_b)}{(V_1+V_b)\cdot(V_2+V_b)} ; T_2 = T_0 \cdot \frac{(V_1-V_b)\cdot(V_2-V_b)}{(V_1+V_b)\cdot(V_2+V_b)}$ The same recurrence is found to hold between $D_3$ and $D_1$ and $T_3$ and $T_1$ . If we set: $$R=\frac{(V_1-V_b)\cdot(V_2-V_b)}{(V_1+V_b)\cdot(V_2+V_b)}$$ We see that both the total duration and the total distance traveled by the bird can be computed summing a
geometrical series  with coefficient $R$ and respective first terms $(T_0+T_1)$ and $(D_0+D_1)$ . $R< 1$ holds, so
convergence is assured. Therefore we have. Solution 2: $$T_t= \sum (T_0+T_1)R^n = \frac{D_0}{V_1+V_2}; D_b= V_b\cdot\frac{D_0}{V_1+V_2}$$ This matches solution (1) as it should. Solution 3: $$D_b= \sum(D_0+D_1)R^n ) = D_0 \cdot \frac{(V_1+V_b)\cdot(V_2-V_1+2 V_b)}{2 V_b\cdot(V_2+V_1)}$$ I am stymied.","['puzzle', 'sequences-and-series']"

So: - $a(x)$ grows at interval $(-\infty, 0)$ from 0 to $+\infty$ - $a(x)$ decreases at interval $(0, 2)$ from $+\infty$ to $\frac {e^2}{4}$ - $a(x)$ grows at interval $(2, +\infty)$ from $\frac {e^2}{4}$ to $+\infty$ It's easy to  understand that f(x) would have 2 roots with parameter $a=\frac {e^2}{4}$.

Let $\boldsymbol{\alpha}(s)$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}(s)$ be two curves parametrized by arc length on the surface $S$ such that $\boldsymbol{\alpha}(0) = \boldsymbol{\beta}(0) = \bf{p}$. Denote the Frenet trihedron of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}(s)$ at $\bf{p}$ by $\bf{t}_{\alpha}$, $\bf{n}_{\alpha}$, $\bf{b}_{\alpha}$; the Frenet trihedron of $\boldsymbol{\beta}(s)$ at $\bf{p}$ by $\bf{t}_{\beta}$, $\bf{n}_{\beta}$, $\bf{b}_{\beta}$. Suppose both curves have the same osculating plane at $\bf{p}$ and the osculating plane is not equal to the tangent plane at $\bf{p}$. i) Show that $\bf{t}_{\alpha}$ and $\bf{t}_{\beta}$ are parallel, i.e. $\bf{t}_{\alpha} = \pm\bf{t}_{\beta}$. ii) Show that $\bf{n}_{\alpha}$ and $\bf{n}_{\beta}$ are parallel, i.e. $\bf{n}_{\alpha} = \pm\bf{n}_{\beta}$. iii) Show that both curves have the same curvature at $\bf{p}$. I have only succeeded in showing i), where the strategy was to first assume they are not parallel. Taking the cross product of the two tangent vectors would then produce the normal of the osculating plane, a non-zero vector parallel to the Gauss map at $\bf{p}$. Since the tangent plane at $\bf{p}$ is defined by the normal vector at $\bf{p}$, i.e. the Gauss map, this implies that the osculating plane is the same as the tangent plane, which contradicts the setup.

784997,Computing localization explicitly for schemes (with a particular view in exercise III 4.7 from Hartshorne),"I'm having some trouble in computing the Čech cohomology for simple schemes (a smooth projective plane curve, for instance). In general, the procedure, apparently, is to find a good cover by affine open sets and then make some computations. However these computations deals with localization of the sections to smaller open sets (the intersection). For instance, in exercise III 4.7 of Hartshorne, I need to get the degree genus formula for a smooth projective plane curves (not necessarilly irreducible), namely $C = V(f(x_0, x_1,x_2))$ of degree $d$, such that $C \cap [1 : 0: 0] = \emptyset$. Therefore, one can cover the curve with two affine open sets $U = C \cap \{x_1 \neq 0 \}$ and $V = C \cap \{ x_2 \neq 0 \}$ and, then compute $$\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X) \oplus \Gamma(V, \mathcal{O}_X) \rightarrow \Gamma(U \cap V, \mathcal{O}_X)$$
 But for $(s_U, s_V) = (g(x_0/ x_1, x_2/ x_1) + (f), h(x_0 / x_2, x_1 /x_2) + (f))$ in the left term, $\delta (s_U, s_V) = (g(x_0/ x_1, x_2/ x_1) + (f))|_{U \cap V} - (h(x_0 / x_2, x_1 /x_2) + (f))|_{U \cap V}= $ something that I don't know how to compute. Furthermore I could have used other local coordinates, namely $(g(x_0, x_2) + (f), h(x_0, x_1) + (f))$ and, then I would get $\delta (s_U, s_V) = g(x_0, 1) - h(x_0, 1) + (f(x_0, 1, 1))$ which seems wrong. So, how shoud I proceed? Moreover, I would be glad if someone could show the same kind of computation in other schemes than the projective space.

Any vector where there are an even number of  non-zero elements which are all next to each other and are all $1$ or all $-1$s. Let us call the number of $1$s or $-1$s $x$.  In this case we just need a $w$ where every window of length $x$ has the same number of $1$s and $-1$s. Any vector which has the same number of $1$s as $-1$s.  In this case $w$ which is all $1$s or all $-1$s will do. But how many others are there apart from these?

It is true that $$\int_{b\Omega}  f(z) d\bar{z}  = -2i \int_{b\Omega} f(z) \frac{\partial \rho}{ \partial z} dS$$ I can prove this by thinking of $d\bar{z}$ as acting on the complexified tangent bundle to $\mathbb{C}$ as follows: $\begin{align}
\int_{b\Omega}  f(z) d\bar{z} &= \int_{b\Omega}  f(z) dz \wedge d\bar{z}( \frac{\partial }{\partial z}, \cdot)\\
&= \int_{b\Omega} f(z)dz \wedge d\bar{z} (d \rho(\frac{\partial }{\partial z}) \nabla \rho, \cdot) \text{ projecting $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ in the direction of $\nabla \rho$ does not change $\\$the value of the differential form, since $\cdot$ is tangent to $b\Omega$}\\

But $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}$  is the unit normal to the boundary, so $i(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y})$ is the unit tangent.  Thus we should have $\frac{d\bar{z}}{|d\bar{z}|} = \overline{i(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y})} = -2i(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} -  \frac{i}{2}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}) = -2i \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}$.

Given a path $\gamma:[0,1]\to\Bbb R^2$, denote its length as $L(\gamma)=\int_\gamma|dx|\in[0,\infty]$ (for non-rectifiable paths, $L(\gamma)=\infty$). Assume now that $S$ is connected and bounded, and let $$\lambda_\epsilon=\inf\Big\{L(\gamma):E_1(S)\subseteq \overline{E_1(\gamma)}\subseteq \overline{E_{1+\epsilon}(S)}\Big\}.$$ This is our best path for a lawnmower with cutting radius $1$ to mow the lawn $E_1(S)$ with an overspill of at most $\epsilon$. The questions are: Does $\lambda_\epsilon$ exist for every $\epsilon>0$? (I think I can prove this.) Does $\lambda_0$ exist? (Not sure about this.) Is $\lambda_\epsilon$ a minimum in either case, i.e. is there an acceptable path whose length is $\lambda_\epsilon$? Are there any algorithms for finding paths whose lengths are within $\delta$ of $\lambda_\epsilon$? (I'm not sure how to make this precise.) This is what I'm thinking about every time I mow my lawn, and I bet I'm not alone. Edit: A proof for the first question: Let $\epsilon>0$. Since $S$ is bounded, so is $E_{\epsilon/2}(S)$, and it is also totally bounded. Therefore, there is a finite cover $(B(\epsilon/2,x_k))_{k=1}^n$ of $E_{\epsilon/2}(S)$ by balls of radius $\epsilon/2$. Since $E_{\epsilon/2}(S)$ is a union of open connected sets, which are connected together by $S$, it is also connected. Now any open connected set is path-connected by polygonal paths, so there is a polygonal path from $x_i$ to $x_{i+1}$ for every $1\le i<n$. The concatenation of these is a polygonal path $\gamma$ which passes through each $x_i$ and remains in $\bigcup_{k=1}^nB(\epsilon/2,x_k)\subseteq E_{\epsilon}(S)$. Then $E_1(\gamma)\subseteq E_{1+\epsilon}(S)$, and any point in $E_1(S)$ is within $1-\epsilon/2$ of a point in $E_{\epsilon/2}(S)$, which is within $\epsilon/2$ of some $x_k\in\gamma$, so $E_1(S)\subseteq E_1(\gamma)$. Finally, since $\gamma$ is polygonal, it is rectifiable, so $\lambda_\epsilon\le L(\gamma)$ and $\lambda_\epsilon$ exists. If you consider the linear paths from $x_i$ to $x_j$ when the balls $B(\epsilon/2,x_i)$ and $B(\epsilon/2,x_j)$ are not disjoint, you get a graph on $n$ vertices, and the problem of finding the shortest path on this graph that visits all the vertices is exactly the Traveling Salesman Problem. Thus this does not bode well for efficient algorithms to solve this problem.","['general-topology', 'asymptotics', 'real-analysis', 'numerical-methods']"

The initial part of the proof goes: Let $S$ be the sphere which bounds the open unit ball $B$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Suppose $f:\mathbb{C}^n\to Y$ is an isomorphism. Put $K=f(S)$. Since $f$ is continuous, $K$ is compact. Since $f(0)=0$ and $f$ is one-to-one, $0 \not\in K$, and therefore there is a balanced neighborhood $V$ of $0$ in $Y$ which does not intersect $K$. The set $$E=f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(V\cap Y) $$ is therefore disjoint from $S$. Since $f$ is linear, $E$ is balanced, and hence connected. Thus $E\subset B$, because $0\in E$, and this implies that the linear map $f^{-1}$ takes $V\cap Y$ into $B$... I understood everything in the proof except the last two sentences in the quoted part.

Write up 1 : Denote $D_f, D_g$ to be the set of all discontinuities of $f$ and $g$. $f+g$ can only be integrable if and only if $D_f \cap D_g$ has measure zero, but without any loss of generality, we also have $D_f \cap D_g \subset D_f$, the set on the left has measure zero. So $f+g$ is Riemann integrable. Okay this one is the longer one. Write up 2 : As $f$ and $g$ are integrable, there are partitions $P_f$ and $P_g$ such that $$U(f,P_f) - L(f,P_f) < \epsilon/2,$$
  $$U(g,P_g) - L(g,P_g) < \epsilon/2.$$
  Now we begin the estimation starting with $$L(f,P)L(g,P) \leq L(fg,P),$$ and $$U(f,P)U(g,P) \geq U(fg, P).$$

U(fg,P) - L(fg,P) &\leq U(f,P)U(g,P) - L(f,P)U(g,P) + L(f,P)U(g,P) - L(f,P)L(g,P) \\

$y^{\prime\prime} + p(x)y^{\prime} + q(x)y = 0$, then
$y = c_{1}\phi + c_{2}\psi$ is the general solution $\forall x \in I$ where $y=0$ only when $c_{1}=c_{2}=0$.  However, if $\phi(x_{0})$ is a relative extremum, then 
$\phi^{\prime}(x_{0}) = \phi(x_{0}) = 0$ and the Wronskian,
\begin{alignat*}{2}
W(x_{0}) &= \left|
\begin{matrix}
\phi(x_{0}) & \psi(x_{0}) \\
\phi^{\prime}(x_{0}) & \psi^{\prime}(x_{0}) \\
\end{matrix}
\right|
&= \phi(x_{0})\psi^{\prime}(x_{0}) - \psi(x_{0})\phi^{\prime}(x_{0})
\end{alignat*}
vanishes for this particular value. I don't see why this is impossible. I know that the Wronskian can be used to show that a set of differentiable functions is linearly independent on an interval by showing that it does not vanish identically, but my understanding is that the converse is not true without any extra conditions like analyticity.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

785930,A group acting on colourings of a set,"Suppose I have a set $L$ with some permutation group $G$ defined upon it, which I think of as a symmetry group. I want to consider the set $F$ of functions $f: L \to C$, for some set $C$. It seems that there should be a natural way in which the group $G$ can also be applied to this set of functions, but I'm not sure of the best way to think about it in terms of abstract algebra. As a concrete example, let $L$ be the faces of a cube, and let $G$ be the group of rotations of the cube. Then $F$ is equivalent to the set of colourings of the cube's faces, with $C$ being the set of possible colours. Given such a colouring, the cube can be rotated to produce another colouring. This allows us, for example, to define a set of equivalence classes where two colourings are considered equivalent if the cube can be rotated to produce one from the other. It seems there at least two ways one could think about this. One is to define a group action of $G$ upon $F$. Another is to think about the symmetries of $F$ as being a group in its own right, which is somehow derived from $L$ and $|C|$. Perhaps there are others. But in either case I don't quite know how to express the idea formally. This seems like it should be a fairly common concept with a collection of well-known standard results, and perhaps some nice generalisations. However, I don't know its name, and the introductory group theory texts I've consulted don't seem to cover it, so I would be grateful if anyone can point me in the right direction. My real reason for wanting to do this is as follows: a cellular automaton is a type of dynamical system, whose state space is the set of colourings of an infinite lattice. The state transition function is typically invariant to translations of the lattice, and optionally also to rotations and reflections. I would like to generalise this concept, allowing us to talk about cellular automata as discrete dynamical systems with a particular type of symmetry.","['discrete-mathematics', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

786148,"Due to numerical inaccuracy, the solution of a boundary value problems becomes negative","I treat a toy example to get my point across. In reality I have to deal with a much more complex model. Let us consider a one dimensional boundary value problem using the bvp5c solver in Matlab. Two liquids enter at different points, move in opposite directions and react with each other. Liquid 1 enters at $x = 0$ and moves in the positive direction. Liquid 2 enters at $x = 1$ and moves in the negative direction. We are interested in the equilibrium distribution of the two concentrations over the domain $[0,1]$. Let $c_1(x)$ be the concentration of liquid 1 at the point $x$ and similarly for liquid two. The differential equations that need to be solved are the following \begin{align}
\frac{dc_1(x)}{dx} &= -(c_1(x) + c_2(x)), \\
\frac{dc_2(x)}{dx} &= K c_1(x) c_2(x),
\end{align} with $K$ a constant that we can choose. Note that the $c_1(x)$ goes down for increasing $x$ and $c_2(x)$ goes down for decreasing $x$, which is exactly as we expect. The two boundary values are $c_1(0) = 10$ and $c_2(1) = 6$. In Matlab, one models this as a boundary value problem with two boundaries and two components. By solving this problem for $K = 1$ we obtain a nice solution shown in the following figure. However, by increasing $K$ to, say, $K = 10^5$ we run into a numerical inaccuracy, see this figure. I also receive a warning message from Matlab, see the bottom of this post. The concentration $c_2(x)$ drops below zero, while that should not be possible according to the second differential equation. My intuition is that this happens because Matlab takes discrete sizes of $dx$ and computes the derivative in a point (which is large) and updates the solution, making the concentration negative. One could combat this phenomenon by increasing the maximum allowed mesh size, but this is not a solution that can be incorporated in my actual model due to the computation time and memory issues. How to make sure that both concentrations are nonnegative ? Matlab code The script that runs the bvp5c solver x = linspace(0,1,100); % the mesh

On the other hand, the Riesz-Markov theorem tells us that the dual of the (non-dense) subspace $C(K)\subset L^\infty(K)$ is the space of regular countably additive measures. Is the former included in the latter, for $K$ compact? What is the difference of the former and $L^1$?

Then, what's the expectation of $Y$(i.e., $E(Y)$)? I have conducted some simulations by Matlab, and the results show that $E(Y)$ may equal to $\frac{1}{n+1}$. Can anyone give a rigorous proof or some hints? Thanks!","['probability-theory', 'expected-value', 'order-statistics']"

786417,Transfinite Knuth-arrow hierarchy vs. fast-growing hierarchy,"Suppose Knuth arrow notation (and hence the hyperoperation sequence ) is extended to transfinite ordinal indices as follows: Let μ be a large countable ordinal such that a fundamental sequence is assigned to every limit ordinal less than μ, and take these to be the same as in the definition of the fast-growing hierarchy of functions ($f_\alpha$). Now define $$
  m\uparrow^\alpha n \ \ = \ \
  \begin{cases}
    m n & \text{if }\alpha=0, \\
    (m\uparrow^{\alpha-1})^n 1 & \text{if }\alpha \text{ is a successor ordinal}, \\
    m\uparrow^{\alpha[n]}n & \text{if }\alpha \text{ is a limit ordinal},
  \end{cases}
$$
for all integers $m, n \ge 0$ and ordinal $\alpha < \mu$, where  $(\alpha[n])_{n=0,1,2,\dots}$ is the fundamental sequence for $\alpha$. It can be shown that for all $\alpha < \omega$, there is an $n_0$ (depending on $\alpha$) such that for all $n > n_0$, 
$$f_\alpha(n) \ \ \lt \ \ 2\uparrow^\alpha n \ \ \le \ \ f_{\alpha+1}(n).\tag{*}$$ Question : Does (*) hold for all $\alpha < \mu$? Or, is there a ""cross-over point"", i.e., a least ordinal $\beta (< \mu)$ such that for all $\alpha \ge \beta, \ \ \ f_\alpha(n) > 2\uparrow^\alpha n \ $ for all sufficiently large $n$? EDIT: Small cases $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ suggest that $\omega$ is actually the cross-over point. Proof? Motivation : If (*) holds for all $\alpha < \mu$, it would seem that with minor adjustments virtually all of the points of interest concerning the fast-growing hierarchy ($f_\alpha)$ apply as well to the hierarchy of functions $(2\uparrow^\alpha)$. NB : Arrow notation has been used for convenience. The discussion could be rephrased in terms of extending the hyperoperation sequence $H_\alpha(m,n)$, with a shift in the indexing to accomodate successor and addition.","['big-numbers', 'hyperoperation', 'number-theory']"

It can be viewed as the number of animals starting from a single pair if any pair of animals can produce a single offspring. The problem is if the most straightforward computer program was implemented (recurrence relation in a loop), it seems it would not finish for the lifetime of its creator... How to approach this differently? EDIT: This number is very large. Its approximation in scientific notation (let's say first 10 decimal digits, and decimal exponent) would be sufficient.","['recurrence-relations', 'sequences-and-series']"
786452,How to find a generator of a cyclic group?,"A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element.  That means that there exists an element $g$, say, such that every other element of the group can be written as a power of $g$.  This element $g$ is the generator of the group.
