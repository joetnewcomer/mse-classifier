1702794,The Moduli Space of Gauge Theory,"Physicists often speak of ""Connections modulo gauge transformations"" as the natural configuration space of a gauge field. In this sense, the fundamental object of study in gauge theory is the space of pairs, $$\frac{(E,\nabla)}{\text{gauge transformations}}$$ Where $E$ is a complex vector bundle, and $\nabla$ is a suitable connection. In the case of gauge group $U(1)$ and line bundle $E=L$, there is a natural identification of this configuration space with the set of holomorphic structures on $L$, i.e., $$\frac{(L,\nabla)}{\text{gauge transformations}}\cong \text{Pic}^0(X)$$ Where the zero is there because there are no magnetic monopoles in nature. This is immensely useful, because the space on the RHS is amazingly
  concrete and visualizable, computable, etc... The question is, does this correspondence continue for bundles of rank higher than one, and general compact gauge group $G$ (i.e. interpretation as holomorphic structures)? This would allow for a similar analysis of general Yang-Mills theory, and other non-abelian gauge theories of the Standard Model. Also, does anyone have references for these results?","['gauge-theory', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

1703034,Intuitive interpration of the Thom isomorphism and relative cohomology,"Let $p: E \rightarrow B $ be an an oriented real vector bundle or rank $n$. Then there exists a unique class $u \in H^n(E, E - B; \mathbb{Z})$, where $B$ is embedded into $E$ as the zero section, such that for any fiber $F$ the restriction of $u$ to $F$ is the class induced by the orientation of $F$. $H^k(E) \cong H^{k+n}(E,E - B)$ and this isomorphism is given explicitly by $\, x \mapsto x \cup u$. I would like to get a feel for this isomorphism. For the record: I am only really interested in smooth vector bundles over manifolds. If $k+n$ is greater than the dimension of the base space then I think this is easily interpreted (though please correct me if I say something wrong or misleading). Writing out the the long exact sequence associated with the relative cohomology, we see that $H^{k+n}(E)$ is zero as $E$ deformation retracts to $B$. We see that in this case $H^{k+n}(E;E - B) \cong H^{k+n-1}(E - B)$. The isomorphism $H^k(E) \cong H^{k+n}(E,E - B)$ then tells us about the cohomology of $H^{k+n-1}(E - B)$, which I can ""feel"" is the twisting of the vector bundle. For the case $k+n$ less than the dimension of the manifold, it is less clear for me how to think of relative cohomology. I know that Bott and Tu have some interpretation like this and a lot of people swear by that book, but to be honest that book just confused me. Maybe I should try again...

1703056,Constructing every spanning tree from addition and deletion of edges,"Let $G = (V,E)$ be given (note that this is not necessarily simple), and consider the set of every spanning tree of $G$, $S$. Choose any $G_a, G_b \in S$. Is it possible to construct $G_b$ from $G_a$ by the following procedure? Let $G_0 := G_a$, $n=0$ Choose an edge from $E$ that is not in $G_n$, and denote it $e$. Adding an edge in a tree will create exactly one unique cycle. Choose an edge in this new cycle formed by $G_n \cup\{e\}$, and remove it. Denote it as $G_{n+1}$. Set $n := n+1$ Repeat steps 2-4. Since every spanning tree will have the same number of edges (namely, $|V|-1$), the edges contained in $G_a$ but not in $G_b$ and the edges contained in $G_b$ but not in $G_a$ have the same cardinality and are distinct. However, it is not guaranteed that the new cycle formed in Step 3 will contain an edge that is contained in $G_a$ but not in $G_b$ so that it can be removed. If it can be proven, then from Step 2 we can simply choose an edge that is contained in $G_b$ but not in $G_a$, and remove an edge that is contained in $G_a$ but not in $G_b$, and proceed.

1703248,Does the Closed Graph Theorem follow from Banach-Steinhaus?,"Q: Is there a simple (but perhaps tricky or clever) proof of the Closed Graph Theorem (or the Open Mapping Theorem, or the result I call the Automatic Inverses Theorem below) from the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem, aka the Uniform Boundedness Principle? It seems to me that there ""should"" be such an argument. Like something is automatically bounded when restricted to finite-dimmensional subspaces of something, or something like that, and then B-S shows that the norms of the whatevers are bounded, hence $T$ is bounded. My work so far: I noticed that three big theorems are equivalent, which surprised me, and that they imply B-S, which surprised me. The one thing I sort of expected, that B-S implies CGT, is the one thing I haven't been able to prove. Just for the amusement of those of you who are amused by such things: Note that $X$ and $Y$ will always denote Banach spaces. There's a corollary of the Open Mapping Theorem that's so trivial it doesn't have a name; I'm going to call it the Automatic Inverses Theorem: Theorem (AIT) If $T:X\to Y$ is a bounded linear bijection then $T^{-1}$ is bounded. It's trivial that OMT implies AIT. A well known cute trick shows that AIT implies CGT. It's also trivial that CGT implies AIT. And it's easy to see that AIT implies OMT: Given a bounded linear surjection $T:X\to Y$, consider the induced map from $X/Z$ to $Y$, where $Z$ is the nullspace of $T$. (Details left to the reader.) And it's not hard to deduce B-S from CGT. Suppose that $T_n:X\to Y$ is a bounded linear operator for $n=1,2,\dots$, and $||T_nx||_Y$ is bounded for every $x\in X$. Let $\ell^\infty_Y$ be the space of bounded sequences of elements of $Y$, with the norm $$||(y_1,y_2,\dots)||=\sup_n||y_n||.$$Define $T:X\to\ell^\infty_Y$ by $$Tx=(T_1x,T_2x,\dots).$$CGT shows easily that $T$ is bounded, and it follows that $||T_n||$ is bounded.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

Question 1: How can we show that $Z$ is an affine scheme? I am trying to follow the hint of exercise II.3.11(b) in Hartshorne, but i am getting stuck: i can show that $Z$ can be covered by a finite number of $\operatorname{Spec}B_i$ and each $\operatorname{Spec}B_i$ can be covered by finitely many $D(\phi_i(a_{ij}))$, where $a_{ij} \in A$, and $\phi_i: A \rightarrow B_i$ is the ring homomorphism that corresponds to the restriction of $f$ to $\operatorname{Spec}B_i$.

1703433,Equal sets have power sets of equal order?,"If two sets say $S$ and $T$ are equal is it true that $|2^{S}| =|2^{T}|$. Here is the motivation. Suppose that $S$ has infinite (or countable) order but that is is written as the union of a finite number of mutually exclusive sets say $S = \bigcup_{i}^{n} R_{i}$. Then at least one of the $R_{i}$ has infinite order else $S$ is finite, a contradiction - I am using the ""pigeonhole principle"" here. Now look at $2^{S}$ and $2^{\bigcup_{i}^{n} R_{i}}$. Is it true that \begin{equation}|2^{S}| = |2^{\bigcup_{i}^{n} R_{i}}| \end{equation} I am thinking that $2^{\bigcup_{i}^{n} R_{i}}$ has order $2^n$ which is finite. But on the other hand $2^{S}$ order is uncountable. Here is an example. Suppose that we write $\mathbb{N} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{2} R_{i}$. We can for instance write $R_{1} = \{1,2,3\}$ and $R_{2}=\{4,5,6,7,8,...\}$ so that $R_{2}$ has infinite order. Now $2^{\bigcup_{i=1}^{2}R_{i}}$ is the set $\{\emptyset, \{R_{1}\}, \{R_{2}\}, \{R_{1}, R_{2}\}$ and has order $4$.

How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when in it is $12\ m$ off the ground? From this I can state the few things: \begin{equation}
\text{Let}\ y(t) = \text{Height of wall at time}\: t \\
\text{Let}\ x(t) = \text{Distance between bottom of ladder and bottom of wall} \\
\text{We know}\ x'(t) = 1 \\
\text{We need to find}\ y'(t)\ \text{when}\ y(t) = 12

& \frac{d}{dt}\bigg[(y(t))^2 + (x(t))^2\bigg] = \frac{d}{dt}\big[15^2\big] \\

The differential of $\psi$ at $m$ is the linear map $$d\psi: M_m\rightarrow N_{\psi(m)}$$
defined by setting $$d\psi(v)(g)=v(g\circ\psi),$$ where $v \in M_m$ is a tangent vector and $g$ is $c^{\infty}$ in a neighborhood of $\psi(m)$. The dual map $$\delta\psi:N^*_{\psi(m)} \rightarrow M^*_m$$ is defined by requiring that $$\delta \psi(\omega)(v)=\omega(d\psi(v))$$ whenever $\omega \in N^*_{\psi(m)}$ and $v\in M_m$ Question I am having some trouble understanding the following: In the special case of a $C^{\infty}$ function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R},$ if $v\in M_m$ and $f(m)=r_0,$ then $$df(v)=v(f)\frac{d}{dr}\bigg |_{r_0}.$$ In this case, we usually take $df$ to mean the element of $M^*_m$ defined by $$df(v)=v(f).$$ That is, we identify $df$ with $\delta f(\omega)$, where $\omega$ is the basis of the $1$ dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^*_{r_0}$ dual to $(d/dr)|_{r_0}$ My Interpretation Since $df(v)$ is a tangent vector at $f(m)=r_0$ and since $\frac{d}{dr}\bigg|_{r_0}$ is a basis for the tangent space at $r_0$, we should have $$df(v)=a\frac{d}{dr}\bigg|_{r_0}.$$ Now, evaluating both sides at $r$ we obtain $$df(v)(r)=a.$$ Now $df(v)(r)=v(r \circ f)=v(f)$ so we have the desired result. Next, I am not sure what the text means when it states that $df(v)=v(f)$. We just showed that $df(v)=v(f)\frac{d}{dr}\bigg |_{r_0}$. In fact, I do not understand how $df$ is being associated with $\delta f(\omega)$ (or why this association even matters). Is the text just trying to say that since $df(v)$ maps into the reals, it is a linear functional on $M_m$?

One of the lessons that gets drummed into you when you study this subject is that it's good to avoid picking bases for your vector spaces until you need them. It's good to keep the freedom to do coordinate transformations... and not just keep it in reserve, but keep it manifest! Why? Is there a simple example of when a choice of coordinates makes a difference in a result? ---thereby giving reason to avoid basis. As Hermann Weyl wrote, ""The introduction of a coordinate system to geometry is an act of violence"". Why?

\end{align} What is the statistical distribution of $$\tilde{C}_k \equiv \tilde{A}_k \tilde{B}_k^* \, ?$$ Attempt Using the fact that the distribution of a sum of random variables is the convolution of the distributions of the things being summed, we can find that $\tilde{A}_k$ is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are independent and both Gaussian distributed with standard deviation $\sigma \sqrt{2N}$.
Then, using the rules for transformation of random variables (and the convolution rule again) we can find that the distribution of the square of the radius $$r^2 \equiv (\text{Re} \tilde{A}_k)^2 + (\text{Im} \tilde{A}_k)^2$$ is $$P_{r^2}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2 N} \exp \left[ -\alpha/\sigma^2 N \right] \qquad (\alpha > 0) \, .$$ Again using transformation rules we find the distribution of the radius $$P_r(r) = \left( \frac{2}{\sigma^2 N} \right) r \exp\left[-r^2 / \sigma^2 N \right] \qquad (r > 0) \, .$$ Note that from this we can compute $\langle r \rangle = \sigma \sqrt{\pi N} / 2$. The statistics of $\tilde{B}_k$ are obviously the same as the statistics of $\tilde{A}_k$. Now we consider $\tilde{C}_k \equiv \tilde{A}_k \tilde{B}_k$.
The phase of $\tilde{C}_k$ is the sum of the phases of $\tilde{A}_k$ and $\tilde{B}_k$.
As the phases of $\tilde{A}_k$ and $\tilde{B}_k$ are both uniformly distributed over $[0,\pi)$, it's obvious that the phase of $\tilde{C}_k$ is also uniformly distributed over that range.
The radius is the interesting part.
The radius of the product is the product of the radii.
Fortunately, we know that the product of two random variables $Z=XY$ follows the distribution $$P_Z(z) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty P_X(x) P_Y(z/x) \frac{1}{|x|}dx \, .$$ Therefore, the distribution of the radius of $\tilde{C}_k$ is \begin{align}
P_{|\tilde{C}_k|}(z)
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty P_r(r) P_r(z/r) \frac{dr}{|r|} \\
&= \int_0^\infty P_r(r) P_r(z/r) \frac{dr}{r} \\
&= \left( \frac{2}{\sigma^2 N} \right)^2 z \int_0^\infty \exp \left[ - \frac{ r^2 + (z/r)^2 }{\sigma^2 N} \right] \frac{dr}{r} \, .
\end{align} I have not been able to solve this integral.
However, we can find the average value of $|\tilde{C}_k|$:
\begin{align}
\langle |\tilde{C}_k| \rangle
&= \int_0^\infty z P_{|\tilde{C}_k|}(z) \, dz \\
&= \left( \frac{2}{\sigma^2 N}\right)^2 \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty dz \, dr \, \frac{z^2}{r} \exp \left(-\left(r^2 + (z/r)^2 \right)/(\sigma^2 N) \right) \\
&= \left( \frac{2}{\sigma^2 N}\right)^2 \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4} (\sigma^2 N)^{3/2}
\int_0^\infty dr \, r^2 \exp \left( -r^2 / \sigma^2 N \right) \\
&= \frac{\pi}{4} \sigma^2 N \, .
\end{align}
which, interestingly, is exactly the square of $\langle r \rangle$ for either $\tilde{A}_k$ or $\tilde{B}_k$.
This is better than nothing, but the full distribution remains to be found.","['statistics', 'noise', 'fourier-analysis']"

Because of the word ""Hence"" I'm assuming that the question doesn't allow integration techniques such as integration by parts or substitution. The first part is trivial. The derivative is $5\ln(2x+1) + \dfrac{2(5x+2)}{2x+1}$. Now my line of thought so far has been to somehow get this derivative to the desired result: $\ln(2x+1)^3$ and then use $f(x)$ to get the integral. However I don't see any straight way to do this. So I decided to experiment a little. Firstly I differentiated $(3x+2)\ln(2x+1)$ and got $$3\ln(2x+1) + \dfrac{2(3x+2)}{2x+1}$$ Now at least I have the $\ln(2x+1)^3$ term but I have another complication: $\dfrac{2(3x+2)}{2x+1}$. I decided to take a look at the answer: $3x\ln(2x+1) + \dfrac{3}{2}\ln(2x+1) - 3x + C$. I thought that if I differentiated this, I would have some idea of where I should go, and how to proceed. So that's what I did, and I got:
$$3\ln(2x+1) + \dfrac{2(3x)}{2x+1} + \dfrac{3}{2x+1} - 3$$ This is perfect because $\dfrac{2(3x)}{2x+1} + \dfrac{3}{2x+1} - 3$ cancels out perfectly. But I have no idea how to get here, starting from $f'(x)$. But I'd say that my first experiment was pretty close. Any help would be highly appreciated.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'calculus']"

It can be shown that $\gamma_{\infty}(G)$ is  the nilpotent residual subgroup of $G$ i.e. for $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$, $G/N$ is nilpotent if and only if $\gamma_{\infty}(G)\le N$. Is it true that
$$

$$ Since 1/ for every prime $p$, $G/O^p(G)$ is a $p-$group hence nilpotent and 2/  for any $A,B$ normal subgroups of $G$, if $G/A$ and $G/B$ are nilpotent, then $G/A\cap B$ is nilpotent, it follows that

I don't know how to prove the converse inclusion and I tend to think it does not hold. 
However I found this is true when $G$ is nilpotent i.e. $\gamma_{\infty}(G)=1$. Indeed, $G$ is then the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. It follows that $O^p(G)$ is the product of all $Q\in Syl(G)$ such that $p \nmid |Q|$, for all primes $p$.

On the other hand we have the construction of the semidirect product which is as follows: consider $G$ , $H$ groups and $\varphi : G\to \operatorname{Aut}(H)$ a homomorphism, we define the semidirect product group as the Cartesian product $G\times H$ together with the operation $$(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)=(g_1g_2,h_1\varphi(g_1)(h_2)),$$ and we denote the resulting group as $G\ltimes H$ . We then show that this is a group and show many properties of it. My point here is the intuition. This construction doesn't seem quite natural to make. There are many operations to turn the Cartesian product into a group. The one used when defining the direct product is the most natural. Now, why do we give special importance to this one?

The associated bundle construction gives an exact tensor functor from finite linear representation of $G$ to vector bundle with $G$-action: $P \times_G(-): Rep(G) \to Vect^G(X)$. How does the essential image of this functor looks like? Is it faithful? full? Perspective 2: Let $V \to X$ be a vector bundle with $G$-action. Under some suitable conditions on $G$ (finite will obviously do but I'm pretty sure weaker assumptions will do - perhaps semisimple is enough) we have the following characterization of $E$. Let $\{V_j\}$ be the trivial vector bundles with $G$ action over $X$ corresponding to the irreducible reprepsentations of $G$. $$V \cong \bigoplus_j V_j \otimes Hom_{G}(V_j,V)$$ Where $G$ acts on $Hom_G(V_j,V)$ trivially. The fact that $Hom_G(V_j,V)$ is a vector bundle follows from the averaging projection operator on sections of any vector bundle with $G$-action. This is a fulll description of the objects in $Vect^G(X)$ (for when $G$ is nice enough so that it holds). One way to spell out my confusion is this: Is a vector bundle with $G$-action the same as a reduction of structure group from $GL(V)$ to $G$? I'm pretty convinced that being a $G$-vector bundle is weaker than having structure group $G$. For example if $G$ is finite then a principal $G$ bundle will always be flat and so will any associated bundle while it looks like $G$-vector bundles mat be non-flat. I don't understand really how these POV's come together. In particular: When is a $G$-vector bundle an associated bundle of some principal bundle? Let $\rho : G \to GL(V)$ be a representation. How does the associated bundle $P\times_{\rho}V$ decompose via perspective 2?

That's why I tried to think of any increasing sequences of integer numbers which would allow to compute $\pi$ in this way. And I mean, without knowing the digits of $\pi$ beforehand. Thus, $a_n, b_n$ have to be defined by recursion themselves. However, I wasn't able to make any progress. 1) The easiest way is to use the known value of $\pi$ to compute various pairs of $N,p$, such that: $$\sqrt{N+p}-\sqrt{N} \approx \pi$$ $$N=\left[\frac{(p-\pi^2)^2}{4 \pi^2} \right]$$ Here $[]$ is the floor function. For example: $$\sqrt{30268+1103}-\sqrt{30268}=3.14159$$ 2) If we let the numbers be rational, and not necessarily increasing, we can use the known series to make something resembling what I want: $$\pi^2=6 \left(1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\cdots \right)$$ $$\pi=\sqrt{6 \left(1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\cdots \right)}-\sqrt{0}$$ 3) Another way, is to use the Spiral of Theodorus (spiral of square roots): $$\rho (n)=\sqrt{n}$$ $$\phi (n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n} \arcsin \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}-\frac{\pi}{2}$$ The $\pi$ arises as a limit of radii difference at approximately the same angle: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \rho(\phi+2\pi)-\rho(\phi)=\pi$$ For example, the first such pair of numbers is: $$\sqrt{21}-\sqrt{2}=3.17$$ However, I'm not sure if it's possible to properly define a sequence I want using this definition for a spiral - it's just too complicated (especially, finding pairs of rays with the closest angles).

1704648,How to prove $P(x)=1-\frac{x^2}{2}$ is a good approximation of order $3$ for $f(x)=\cos x$ near $x=0$?,"Let $f$ be a function and we want to approximate $f$ using a different function $P$ near $x=0$. The error of approximation is $E(x)=f(x)-P(x)$. If the approximation is going to be any good, we want  $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}E(x)=0$. In fact, we want $E(x)$ approaches $0$ fast as $x\rightarrow 0$ Definition for $good \ approximation$: we say that $P$ is a good approximation of order $n$ for $f$ near $x=0$ when $E(x)$ approaches $0$ faster than $h_n(x)=x^n$. Definition for $approache\ 0\ faster$: Assume $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}g(x)=0$. We say $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}f(x)$ approaches $0$ faster than $g(x)$, as $x\rightarrow 0$, when $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0$. How to prove $P(x)=1-\frac{x^2}{2}$ is a good approximation of order $3$ for $f(x)=\cos x$ near $x=0$? Here is my try: We have $E(x)=f(x)-P(x)=\cos x -1+\frac{x^2}{2}$. Since $E(x)$ and $x^3$ are continuous and $E(0)=0^3=0$, then $\frac{E(x)}{x^3}=\frac{\cos x -1+\frac{x^2}{2}}{x^3}=\frac{\frac{\cos x}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^2}+\frac{1}{2}}{x}$. Clearly $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{E(x)}{x^3}=0$. I think we can conclude that $P$ is a good approximation as $E(x)$ approaches $0$ faster than $x^3$. However I am sure the steps shouldn't be this simple. Could someone help?","['limits', 'functions', 'calculus', 'error-function', 'sequences-and-series']"
1704666,Question about proof that the Grassmannian is a parameter space,"Edit: If it is easier to give a reference where this is written down in detail, I would gladly accept that as an answer. Fix a base scheme $B$, and fix $n$ and $k$ with $k<n$. In section 28.3 of Vakil's notes, there is a sketch of the proof that the Grassmannian -- defined as the scheme that represents the functor classifying surjections $\mathcal O_B^n \rightarrow \mathcal G$ onto rank $k$ locally free sheaves -- is the parameter space for closed subschemes of $\mathbb P^{n-1}_B$ (finitely presented and flat over $B$) whose fibers over points in the base are linearly embedded copies of $\mathbb P^k_{k(b)}$. In it, he shows how to get from rank $k$ surjections to closed subschemes, and from closed subschemes to rank $k$ surjections. I'm having trouble showing these are actually inverse operations. Fix a closed subscheme $X\subset \mathbb P^{n-1}_B$ of the appropriate form over $B$. Twisting the subscheme exact sequence gives
$$0\rightarrow I_X(1)\rightarrow \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^{n-1}}(1) \rightarrow \mathcal O_X(1) \rightarrow 0.$$ Now, $\mathcal O_X(1)$ restricted to each fiber of the projection $\pi$ to $B$ is $\mathcal O(1)$ on the linearly embedded projective subspace, and this sheaf has no higher cohomology. So, by the theorem on base change and cohomology (see Vakil for details), the higher pushforwards of $\mathcal O_X(1)$ vanish, and there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow \pi_* I_X(1)\rightarrow \pi_* \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^{n-1}}(1) \rightarrow \pi_*\mathcal O_X(1) \rightarrow 0.$$ The middle term is $\mathcal O_B^n$, and we obtain a surjection
$$\mathcal O_B^n\rightarrow \pi_*\mathcal O_X(1)$$
onto a locally free sheaf of rank $k$. Now we go the other way, applying $\operatorname{Proj}_B (\operatorname{Sym}^\bullet)$ to both sides to yield a closed subscheme
$$\operatorname{Proj}_B (\operatorname{Sym}^\bullet \pi_*\mathcal O_X(1)) \rightarrow \operatorname{Proj}_B (\operatorname{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal O_B^n)=\mathbb P^n_B.$$ Why does this recover the original subscheme?","['moduli-space', 'algebraic-geometry', 'grassmannian', 'schemes', 'projective-schemes']"
1704676,What are all the elements of the group of symmetries of a regular tetrahedron?,"I can see that why the order of the group of symmetries of a regular tetrahedron is $12$ : Roughly speaking, each time one of ${\{1,2,3,4}\}$ is on 'top' and we do to the other $3$ as we did in a regular triangle. But I need to know the elements of the group and I don't have not only a physical regular tetrahedron but also my imagination is not strong. Videos like $1$ or $2$ didn't help, because I can't understand for example what happens to the other $2$ points when the top point and one of the surface points is exchanged. I would appreciate any simple clear explanation. Added - For next permutations (with order $3$) now simply we consider the ‘surface’ under the other three-points, i.e. each time $4$ on top is replaced by $1$ or $2$ or $3$. And, we perform rotations as we were doing when $4$ was on top. So we will get: ‘$4$’ on top : ${\{(123),(132)}\}$ ‘$1$’ on top : ${\{(234),(243)}\}$ ‘$2$’ on top : ${\{(134),(143)}\}$ ‘$3$’ on top : ${\{(124),(142)}\}$. But what about $(12)(34)$, $(13)(24)$ and $(14)(23)$? How to get them?","['permutations', 'rotations', 'group-theory']"
1704703,Proportion of elements of prime order $p$ in $S_n$,"I was trying to answer the following question recently: What is the proportion of elements of order $p$ in the symmetric group $S_n$ , where $p$ is some prime number ? I managed to work out that in general, the number of elements of order $p$ in $S_n$ is: $$ {n \choose p} (p-1)! +\displaystyle  \sum_{k=2}^{[\frac{n}{p}]} \frac{n!}{k!p^k},$$ where $[x]$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ . Using this, as well as the Taylor series at $x=0$ for $\large e^{\frac{1}{p}}$ , I was able to determine that the proportion of elements of order $p$ in $S_n$ as $n \to \infty$ is: $\displaystyle  \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!p^k} = \large e^{\frac{1}{p}} - \small \frac{p+1}{p}$ I was wondering what significance, if any, this has - it feels somewhat similar to the result that states that the limit of the ratio of the number of derangements of $n$ elements to $n!$ is $\frac{1}{e}$ , but admittedly I don't fully understand the significance of this result either. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!","['asymptotics', 'number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"

The first thing I tried was Eisenstein, but that obviously doesn't work with the polynomial in that form. Then I looked at $p$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_5$ in order to show that it irreducible in one of them and then to use Gauß' Theorem. However, it turns out that $p$ is reducible over both fields. I've seen people use nifty substitutions in connection with the Eisenstein criterion. I tried to represent $p$ in terms of $x+1$, but that doesn't seem to work, either. Now I'm at my wit's end. What else could I try?","['irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

1704806,Topology on the space of universally integrable functions,"Let $X$ be a compact space. Let us call a function $f:X\to {\mathbb C}$ universally integrable if it is integrable with respect to each regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ (i.e. a positive functional on ${\mathcal C}(X)$, according to Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem ). Let us denote by ${\mathcal U}(X)$ the space of all universally integrable functions on $X$. My questions: What is known about ${\mathcal U}(X)$? Is it an algebra (with respect to the pointwise multiplication)? Did anybody try to find a natural topology on ${\mathcal U}(X)$? EDIT . This was put on hold as too broad, so I add some details. I would be grateful for any references where what I am asking is discussed. Nate Eldredge already answered the second of the three questions here, so there is no need to discuss this further. As to the third one, the correct specification will be the following. As I wrote in comments to Eldredge's answer, I believe, there is a topology on ${\mathcal U}(X)$ that turns it into an involutive stereotype algebra (see here , or here , or here ) such that the involutive spectrum (see again here ) of ${\mathcal U}(X)$ as a set is equal to $X$ (like in the case of ${\mathcal C}(X)$):
$$
\text{Spec}\ {\mathcal U}(X)=X
$$
Of course, such a topology on ${\mathcal U}(X)$ must be much weaker than the $C^*$-topology that Nate Eldredge suggests. Am I right? As a hypothesis, the following construction can be discussed: to each regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ one can associate a mapping $\varPhi_\mu:{\mathcal U}(X)\to L(\mu)$. So ${\mathcal U}(X)$ can be naturally embedded into the direct product of the spaces $L(\mu)$.
$$
{\mathcal U}(X)\to \prod_{\mu} L(\mu).
$$
I am now thinking about the topology generated on ${\mathcal U}(X)$ by this embedding (i.e. the initial topology generated by the mappings $\varPhi_\mu$). Is it possible that this is what I need?","['functional-analysis', 'integration', 'topological-vector-spaces']"
