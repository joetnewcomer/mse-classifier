1113679,Trigonometric functions - finding solutions,"Question: Find the general solution for the equation:
  $$\sin x + 2\sin2x - \sin3x = 3$$ Approach:
Well using the identity of $\sin a - \sin b $, I merged together $\sin x - \sin3x$
And as $\sin 2x = 2\sin x\cos x$, I got up till here:
$$2\sin x(2\cos x - \cos 2x) = 3$$ Edit: Considering $\sin x - \sin 3x = -2\cos 2x\sin x$
  The equation becomes:
  $$-2\cos 2x\sin x+2\sin 2x = 3$$
  $$(-2\sin x)\cos 2x +2\sin 2x = 3$$
  The maximum value of the equation $asinx + bcosx$ is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
  Using this in here: (considering $b = -2\sin x$ and $a = 2$)
  $$3 \leq \sqrt{4\sin^2 x + 4}$$
  $$3/2 \leq \sqrt{1 + sin^2x}$$
  Obviously cannot happen as maximum value of $\sqrt{1 + sin^2x}$ is $\sqrt2$",['trigonometry']

1113781,Approximation of the exponential,"Let $c>1,k\in\mathbb{N}$. Let's consider two approximations of the exponential function : The first one is the most common one $f_k(x)=\left(1+\frac{x}{c^k}\right)^{c^k}$ and the second one is $q_k(x)=\displaystyle\sum _{p=0}^k\frac{c^{\frac{p^2+p}{2}}}{\displaystyle\prod _{n=1}^p(c^n-1)\prod_{n=1}^{k-p}(1-c^n)}f_p\left(x\right)$. It has been shown here that $q_k(x)$ goes to $e^x$ as $c\to\infty$ or $k\to\infty$. In the following question, we'll stay with with fixed $c,k$ However, after experimenting a bit on desmos , I have conjectured some results I am not able to prove mathematically, and therefore have some question : One can see (on the desmos graph) that there exists a non empty interval $I$ around $0$ on which $q_k(x)$ is a better approximation of $e^x$ than $f_k(x)$ (by that I mean that $\forall x\in I,|q_k(x)-e^x|\le|f_k(x)-e^x|$). As $c$ or $k$ increase, this interval gets larger and larger. How can one prove that such an interval exists ? What are the bounds of this interval ? It seems to me that on this interval, $q_k(x)$ 'sticks' to $e^x$ way closer than $f_k(x)$ does. I conjectured that $\forall\epsilon,c>0,\exists k\in\mathbb{N},\forall x\in[-c,c],\left|\dfrac{q_k(x)-e^x}{f_k(x)-e^x}\right|<\epsilon$. How can one show that ?","['convergence-divergence', 'calculus', 'exponential-function', 'functions', 'approximation']"

1114038,Adjacency matrix and existence of triangle,"Show that a graph $G$ contains a triangle (1) if and only if there
exist indices $i$ and $j$ such that both the matrices $A_G$ and $A^{2}_{G}$ have the
entry $(i, j)$ nonzero, where $A_{G}$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ (2) . $1 \implies 2$ If the graph contains a triangle, the entries in the matrix which correspond to edges between the vertices that that make up the triangle will be non-zero. 
Each such pair $(i,j)$ will also be non-zero in $A^{2}_{G}$, because there is a path of length two between $i$ and $j$ (within the triangle), starting from $i$, using another vertex $k$
and ending in $j$. $2 \implies 1$ If $(i,j)$ is 1 in $A_{G}$, then the vertices $i$ and $j$ must be connected. Furthermore, if $(i,j)$ is 1 in $A^{2}_{G}$ that means there must be some other vertex $k$ through which we can go to $j$ starting from $i$.

1114093,Why would a uniform prior distribution give a different result than a purely frequentist approach?,"I would expect a uniform prior to be a good example of an uninformed prior and get the same result as the frequentist approach. However, this is not the case. As an example, let's look the classical Bernoulli problem - you flip coins and $s$ are heads, $f$ are tails. You want to predict $p$, the probability of heads on any given coin flip. Frequentist Approach The frequentist approach is to say that $p$ is simply $s/(s + f)$. In this approach, we assume nothing about the distribution of $p$ and we're simply finding the maximium likelihood estimate. This makes sense to me. Bayesian approach Now, let's say you do the Bayesian approach and you say: $$
P(p|data) = \dfrac{P(data | p) \cdot P(p)} {P(data)}
$$ According to wikipedia , if you make your prior the beta distribution, you get: $$
P(p|data) = \dfrac{p^{s+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{f+\beta-1}}{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)}
$$ Now let's say we want to find the expected value of p: $$
E[p|data] = \int_{0}^{1} P(p|data) \cdot p \cdot dp
$$
$$
E[p|data] = \int_{0}^{1} \dfrac{p^{s+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{f+\beta-1}}{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)} \cdot p \cdot dp
$$
$$
E[p|data] = \int_{0}^{1} \dfrac{p^{s+\alpha}(1-p)^{f+\beta-1}}{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)} \cdot dp
$$
$$
E[p|data] = \dfrac{B(s+\alpha + 1, f+\beta)}{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)}
$$ Great! We can continuing simplifying this since we know a property of the beta function: $$
B(s + 1, f) = B(s, f) \cdot \dfrac{s} {s + f}
$$ Which implies: $$
E[p|data] = \dfrac{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)}{B(s+\alpha, f+\beta)} \cdot \dfrac{s+\alpha}{f+\beta}
$$ $$
E[p|data] = \dfrac{s+\alpha}{s+\alpha + f+\beta}
$$ Makes sense so far! Now, let's say we want to choose a really ""objective"" prior to emulate the frequentist approach, like a uniform distribution. This is equivalent to Beta(1,1). In this case, we would get: $$
E[p|data;\alpha=1,\beta=1] = \dfrac{s+1}{s + f + 2}
$$ This hurts my brain. Even though we're being as objective as we can (""p is equally likely to be anything""), we're getting a different result than the frequentist approach. On the flip side, if we do the improper prior Beta(0,0), we get the same result as the frequentist approach: $$
E[p|data;\alpha=0,\beta=0] = \dfrac{s}{s + f}
$$ What makes Beta(0,0) more similar to the frequentist approach than Beta(1,1)? What assumption are we making in Beta(1,1)? How is Beta(0,0) ""less informed""?","['bayesian', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

1114108,Expected Value of R squared,"Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer. Generate $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ from the set $[0,1]$, with the probability distribution being the uniform one and the $x_i$ all being independent of each other. Now repeat this process to generate $y_1, ..., y_n$. If we let $X$ be a random variable which takes on $x_1, ..., x_n$ with probability $\frac{1}{n}$ each, and let $Y$ be a random variable which takes on $y_i$ whenever $X$ takes on a value of $x_i$. We can then compute the square of the correlation $R^2$ between $X$ and $Y$. What is the expected value of this $R^2$? Another less rigorous phrasing of the problem is this: suppose we throw $n$ points at random on a graph spanning $[0,1] \times [0,1]$. What is the expected value of the $R^2$ of the line of best fit? For instance, for $n=2$ the expected value is $1$ due to the $R^2$ value always being $1$. For $n=3$ one can numerically compute the expected value to be $\frac{1}{2}$. In general, it seems that the answer is $\frac{1}{n-1}$. I don't really have any idea how to do this problem in general; and even specific cases look nontrivial. Does anyone have any ideas? This looks like what should be a well-known result, but my searching didn't pick up on anything which looked useful. This has applications in that when one is working with variables which are not expected to be very highly correlated, it is often difficult to tell when an $R^2$ value is significant. This result gives an idea of how big the $R^2$ needs to be for one to deduce there is some nontrivial correlation between two variables.","['statistics', 'probability-theory']"

In both cases, my argument went something like Define the metric. Show the Christoffel symbols are zero. Use this to show there is no curvature. But I feel like this is just me avoiding the real stuff. In other words, I resort to calculus because I don't actually know what I'm doing.

1114343,Is a connected Reinhardt Domain which containg $0$ necessarely a polydisc?,"I'm studying several complex variables basics. Roughly speaking: call $D\subseteq\Bbb C^n$ the set of points in which a given power series

converges normally. Call $B$ the set of $z$'s such that $|a_{\alpha}(z-z_0)^{\alpha}|<c$ for all $\alpha\in\Bbb N^n$. We know that $D=\operatorname{int}B$. This allow us to understand that $D$ must be a Reinhardt and complete domain (complete means that given $z\in D$ then, $w\in\Bbb C^n$ s.t. $|w_j|\le|z_j|\;\forall j=1,\dots,n\;\Longrightarrow w\in D$); furthermore these domains are characterized to be union of polydiscs centered in $0$ (easy to see). We know moreover that holomorphic functions are exactly convergent power series on union of polydiscs. In particular, over a Reinhardt complete domain, an holomorphic function is always represented as a sum of a power series centered in $0$. Now my book states and proves a theorem which says that the last conclusion is nevertheless reached even if we don't ask the completeness. Precisely the theorem says: Let $\Omega\subseteq\Bbb C^n$ a Reinhardt domain, connected, containing $0_{\Bbb C^n}$ and $f\in\mathcal{H}(\Omega)$. Then
$$
f(z)=\sum_{\alpha}\frac{f^{(\alpha)}(0)}{\alpha!}z^{\alpha}

1114421,"Can someone verify my direct proof that if $A$ is a subset of $B$, $A\cup B = B$?","This is a problem from Discrete Mathematics and its Applications I am trying to use a direct proof to do this problem. Here is my book's explanation/section on direct proof Here is my work so far I used this property of sets(from https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse311/14au/slides/lecture09-filled.pdf ) Basically that two sets are equal if they are subsets of each other. I know that for a direct proof, I am trying to prove p -> q, or in this case, if A is a subset of B, then the union of A and B is equal to B.  My first step was assuming that  A is a subset of B meaning that if x is in A, x is also in B. Because I have an implication involving two propositions, I used the law of implication to convert p -> q into ~p v q. My initial assumption ends up being X is not in A or x is in B.(assumption). I first tried showing that $A\cup B$ is a subset of B. To do this, I used the definition of $A\cup B$ to say that if X is a member of $A\cup B$, either X is in A or X is in B. From our initial assumption(X is not in A or X is in B), if X is in A, then X has to be in B(first condition isn't met, second has to be met). In the other case if X is in B, then X is in B. So In either case of the Union possibility, X ends up being a member of B. After this, I have shown that B is a subset of $A\cup B$. My next step was to show that B is a subset of $A\cup B$. Or another way of saying it, if X is a member of B, then it is a member of $A\cup B$. By definition of union, if X is a member of $A\cup B$,  is either in A or in B. From that, my next logical step was saying that if X is a member of B, it is also a member of $A\cup B$  because it meets the second condition in the conjunction, in B.  I can now conclude that  $A\cup B$ is a subset of B. Because I have shown that if A is a subset of B,  $A\cup B$  is a subset of B and B is a subset of $A\cup B$. By definition of equality of sets, $A\cup B$ is equal to B. Does everything look logically coherent/organized?

An embedded submanifold of $M$ is a subset $S$ of $M$ such that $S$ is a topological manifold under the subspace topology induced by $M$ , endowed with a smooth structure such that the inclusion map $i:S\to M$ is a smooth embedding. Is it true that if $M$ is a smooth manifold and $S$ is a subset $M$ , then there is a unique smooth structure, if one exists, which makes $S$ into an embedded submanifold? Suppose there is a smooth structure on $S$ which makes the inclusion map $i:S\to M$ a smooth embedding. Let $\mathscr A =\{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)\}_{\alpha\in J}$ be a smooth atlas on $M$ . Then I think the set $$\mathscr B=\{(U_\alpha\cap S,\varphi_\alpha|_{U_\alpha\cap S}):\alpha\in J\}$$ is a smooth atlas on $S$ , since any two elments in $\mathscr B$ are smoothly compatible (borrowing from the smooth compatibility of $(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)$ and $(U_\beta,\varphi_\beta)$ ).
The inclusion map can also be shown to be smooth under this smooth structure.

For two people, the probability that they share a birthday is simply $1/365$, not counting leap years. For three people, it is the probability of every combination of two of them ""ored"" together, which is simply the sum of the probabilities of every combination of two people. Thus, $$
P(2)=P(AB)=\frac{1}{365}
$$
$$
P(3)=P(AB)+P(AC)+P(BC)=3\times P(2)
$$
$$
P(4)=P(AB)+P(AC)+P(AD)+P(BC)+P(BD)+P(CD)=6\times P(2)
$$ Where $P(XY)$ is used to denote the probability of persons $X$ and $Y$ sharing a birthday. You can see pretty clearly that the coefficients are binomial. $$
P(N)=\binom{N}{2}\times P(2)=\frac{N!}{2!(N-2)!}\cdot\frac{1}{365}=\frac{N(N-1)}{730}

Well, it's the first time I've seen this word ""homeomorphism"" but I read online that a map is a homeomorphism if $f$ and its inverse is continuous and $f$ is bijective.

Well from the correspondence theorem, there's a bijective correspondence between the morphisms of $U \rightarrow W$ and the k-algebra morphisms $k[W] \rightarrow k[U]$ so it follows that $f$ is surjective since $f'$ is surjective. Now I want to show that $f$ is injective.

1 - \frac{1}{10^\infty}

Hint: Use the fact that the set of all characteristic functions (i.e. functions assuming only the values of 0 and 1) defined on M is equivalent to the set of all subsets of M.

$$X(t) = X(0) + \sum_{l\in \mathbb{Z}^d}l\cdot N_l\left(\int_0^t \beta_l(X(s))ds \right)$$ The most common approach to do this is to prove tension of the family $X^n$ and then prove that every limit point is $X$.

1115105,Fascinating induction problem with numerous interpretations,"Problem: Suppose you begin with a pile of $n$ stones and split this pile into $n$ piles of one stone each by successively splitting a pile of stones into two smaller piles. Each time you split a pile, multiply the number of stones in each of the two smaller piles you form, so that if these piles have $r$ and $s$ stones in them, respectively, you compute $rs$. Once you have finished splitting the piles, calculate the sum of the products computed at each step. Does the order of how you split the piles effect the final summation? Simple strong induction proof: It looks as if the sum will always be $n(n-1)/2$. Briefly, the pile of $n$ stones is split into piles of $r$ and $s=n-r$ stones, where $r$ is a positive integer less than $n$. The key inductive step for the strong induction proof is
$$
rs+\frac{r(r-1)}{2}+\frac{s(s-1)}{2}=\frac{(r+s)(r+s-1)}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
$$ My question: Are there any neat ways to interpret this problem and its solution? This problem appears in several sources where the result is often included and you are asked to prove it using induction. I noticed that there are a number of ways to view this problem and its concomitant analogues (but I am lacking a good, intuitive geometric interpretation or analysis): Combinatorics: Instead of summing the products for all of the pile splittings for $n$ stones, label the stones $1$ through $n$ and let them be elements of a set $M$. For every split, pair all of the stones in the first set with all of the stones in the second set. Every pair produced in this way appears exactly once during the activity. The terms in the sum are the number of new pairs generated after every split. Consider the power set $\mathcal{P}(M)$. By making such pairings, we have generated all distinct 2-element subsets of $\mathcal{P}(M)$. Graph theory: Instead of summing the products for all of the pile splittings for $n$ stones, scatter the stones on a flat surface. Mathematically speaking, let $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ be $n$ points in a plane where no three points are collinear. Each point represents a stone or vertex. With this understanding, the situation may be modeled by a simple graph $G=(V,E)$. If we were to connect every pair of vertices with an edge for a graph $G$, that is, construct the complete graph $G=K_n$, then the number of edges for $K_n$ would be the same as the sum of the products in the original activity. Combinatorics and graph theory: We can actually give a sort of restatement of the key inductive step that was used to prove the result of the activity by considering an exercise that appears in D.B. West's Introduction to Graph Theory : $\underline{\text{Exercise:}}$ Use complete graphs and counting arguments to prove that
$$
\binom{n}{2} = \binom{k}{2} + k(n-k) +\binom{n-k}{2}\quad|\quad 0\leq k\leq n.
$$ Proof . Consider the complete graph $K_n$ which has $\binom{n}{2}$ edges. If we partition the vertices of $K_n$ into a set with $k$ elements and a set with $n-k$ elements, then we can count the edges as those within one block of the partition and those choosing a vertex from each. Consequently, the number of edges is given by $k(n-k)+\binom{k}{2}+\binom{n-k}{2}$. I think these are some pretty cool ways to look at the original problem/activity. A geometric interpretation (or other) that added some intuition as to why the result of the activity is true would be quite nice.","['geometry', 'induction', 'recreational-mathematics', 'alternative-proof']"

  Show that $\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty} S_n = \infty$ almost surely. I can't solve that one. My thoughts so far: Ok, $A:=\bigl\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty} S_n = \infty \bigr\} = \bigl\{\inf_{n\geq 1}\sup_{\nu\geq n} S_\nu = \infty\bigr\} $ is in the tail field
$A\in\mathcal{T}\bigl((X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\bigr)$.
Because $\sup_{\nu\geq n} S_\nu$ is monotonically decreasing, $A$ happens exactly when $A_n := \bigl\{\sup_{\nu\geq n} S_\nu = \infty\bigr\}$ happen for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But since $A_{n+1}$ implies $A_n$ (the supremum is monotonically decreasing) and $A_{n+1}^c$ implies $A_{n}^c$ (if $\sup_{\nu\geq n+1} S_\nu$ is finite, $\sup_{\nu\geq n} S_\nu$ will still be finite), we get $A_n = A_{n+1}$ and inductively that $A_1 = A_{n}$. Now, By Kolmogorov’s $0-1$ Law, $\mathbf{P}[A]\in\{0, 1\}$.

1115359,Another question about $x_0$ in the Taylor series,"When we talk about Taylor series, we say it's around point $x_0$. It's in the Taylor series formula: $$f(x) = f(x_0) + (x-x_0)f'(x_0) + \frac{(x-x_0)^2f''(x_0)}{2} + \frac{(x-x_0)^3f'''(x_0)}{6} +  + ...$$ What I don't understand what is this point $x_0$? We're given Taylor formulas for $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, etc, and they don't have this point $x_0$ in the formula? It's somehow chosen to be $0$ so it disappears, but what does that mean? Doesn't that mean the Taylor series works only around $0$? But then we somehow can use the formula for any $x$, even $100$ or $100,000$, and it still gives the right result? What happens if we choose $x_0$ to be $1$? or $25$? That would change the Taylor formula for the primitive functions but would it still work for any $x$? I'm very confused.","['functions', 'taylor-expansion']"
