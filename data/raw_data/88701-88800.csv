1193057,Showing that $\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(0)}{g'(0)}$.,"If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions with $f(0) = g(0) = 0$ and $g'(0) \neq 0$, show that $\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(0)}{g'(0)}$. I consider that perhaps: $$
\begin{align}
\\ \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f(0+x) - f(0)}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{ \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{g(0+x) - g(0)}{x}} = f'(0) \cdot \frac{1}{g'(0)} = \frac{f'(0)}{g'(0)}

1193084,Proof of squeeze theorem for functions,"Suppose for all $x$ we know $g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to c} g(x)=L=\lim_{x\to c} h(x)$. Does the following argument work to conclude that $\lim_{x\to c} f(x)=L$? Let $\epsilon\gt 0$ be given. Then we can find a $\delta_1$ such that if $|x-c|\lt\delta_1$, then $|g(x)-L|\lt\epsilon$ and a $\delta_2$ such that if $|x-c|\lt\delta_2$ then $|h(x)-L|\lt\epsilon$. Let $\delta = min\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}$. Then for all x such that $|x-c|\lt\delta$, it follows that $|g(x)-L|\lt\epsilon$ and $|h(x)-L|\lt\epsilon$. This means that $L-\epsilon\lt g(x)\le h(x)\lt L+\epsilon$. But since $g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)$,  $L-\epsilon\lt f(x) \lt L+\epsilon$. Hence $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L$. This proof is slightly different from others that I've seen, but it doesn't seem to be wrong. Is there anything that I'm missing?",['real-analysis']

1193223,Extension Lemma for Smooth maps (Lee vs. Lee),"I've been reading Jeffrey Lee's, Manifolds and Differential Geometry and John Lee's, Introduction to smooth manifolds . In the first book ( here , in page 31), after introducing partition of unity, there's an exercise that says: Exercise 1.74. Show that if a function is smooth on an arbitrary set $S\subset M$ as defined earlier, then it has a smooth extension to an open set that contains $S$. Where he says "" as defined earlier "", I assumed he meant that $M$ was paracompact, but maybe I missed something else. On the sencond book (check here , in page 45) there's the Extension Lemma for Smooth Functions, and it says: Lemma 2.26 (Extension Lemma for Smooth functions). Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, $A \subset M$ is a closed subset, and $f:A\to\Bbb R^k$ is a smooth function. For any open subset $U$ containing $A$, there exists a smooth function $\hat f:M\to\Bbb R^k$ such that $\hat f|_A=f$ and $supp(f) \subset U$. And after proving the lemma there is this exercise that made me very confused. Exercise 2.27. Give a counterexample to show that the conclusion of the extension
  lemma can be false if A is not closed. Doesn't exercise 2.27 imply that exercise 1.74 is incorrect? Are those trick questions? Like when you are asked to prove something right but it turns out is not? Or, more likely, did I missed something in Jeffrey Lee's book?","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
1193262,"For a random variable $X$ such that $P(a<X<b)=1$, showing $E(X)E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) \le\frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab}$","I've worked on the following problem and have a solution (included below), but I would like to know if there are any other solutions to this problem, particularly more elegant solutions that apply well known inequalities that I've overlooked. QUESTION : Suppose we have a random variable s.t. $P(a<X<b) =1$  where $0 < a < X < b$ , $a$ and $b$ both positive constants. Show that $$E(X)E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) \le \frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab}$$ Hint :  find constant c and d s.t. $\frac{1}{x} \le cx+d$ when $a<x<b$, and argue that then we shall have $E(\frac{1}{X}) \le cE(X)+d$ MY SOLUTION : For a line $cx+d$ that cuts through $\frac{1}{X}$ at the points $x=a$ and $x = b$, it's easy to show that $ c = - \frac{1}{ab} $  and $d = \frac{a+b}{ab} $, $$ E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) \le - \frac{1}{ab} E(X) + \frac{a+b}{ab} $$ $$ abE\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) + E(X) \le (a+b) $$ and because both sides of the inequality are positive, it follows that: $$ \left(abE\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) + E(X)\right)^2 \le (a+b)^2 $$ $$ (ab)^2E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^2 + 2abE\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) + E(X)^2  \le (a+b)^2 $$ Now, for the LHS, we can see that 
$2abE\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) \le (ab)^2E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^2 + E(X)^2$ because $0 \le (ab)^2E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^2 - 2ab\,E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) + E(X)^2 = \left(ab\,E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right) - E(X)\right)^2 $ So, $$ 4ab\,E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) \le (ab)^2E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^2 + 2ab\,E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) + E(X)^2  \le (a+b)^2 $$ and therefore: $$ E\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)E(X) \le \frac{(a+b)^2}{4ab} $$  Q.E.D.

1193304,Showing a complex analytic function is unbounded,"This was one of the problems on a previous year's Complex Analysis final exam. Assume $f\in \mathcal O (\mathbb H )$, non-constant, and $f(\frac {i}{\sqrt n})=0, \forall n\in \mathbb N$. Prove that $f$ takes unbounded values. What I tried so far: I tried to argue that the point $z=0$ had to be an essential singularity since the function cannot be continued to be holomorphic there (taking the value $0$), for then it would be forced to be identically the $0$ function (which it is assumed not to be). Then i squared the input domain to argue that the essential singularity must take on unbounded values in the upper-half plane somewhere near $z=0$. But, I think my reasoning is wrong because this may not be an isolated singularity at all and may be a point in the branch cut of a holomorphic function or something. I'm wondering if someone can write me up a nice proof and/or explanation about how to tackle this problem, thanks.","['singularity-theory', 'complex-analysis']"
1193331,Graphs of interesting integrals of the form: $\int \sin^a(x^a)\cos^a(x^a)$,"Here are a few graphs of the form:- $$\int \sin^a(x^a)\cos^a(x^a)dx$$
Where $a$ is an even, positive integer. $a = 2$ $a = 4$ $a = 6$ Now, a few graphs of the form:- $$\int \sin^a(x^a)\cos^a(x^a)dx$$
Where $a$ is an odd, positive integer. $a = 1$ (Common) $a = 3$ $a = 5$ $a = 7$ The integrals themselves are hideous.. But the graphs are fun to observe (At least for me), especially for the cases where a is odd. I know that the difference in these graphs (Between odd and even $a$ ) is caused mainly by the powers the sin and cos functions are raised to, rather than the powers of the arguments of these functions. I have 4 questions :- Why does $\int \sin^a(x^a)\cos^a(x^a)dx$ , where $a$ is even, have fewer and fewer oscillations (i.e. the line becomes less wavy) as the value of $a$ increases? (Note: I know that the lines come closer and closer to the x-axis as evidenced by the outputs of the integral on the graph) What is going on when $a$ is odd? Can you explain why that beaker-like structure is formed; specifically, why does it seems to dip around a certain value ,then raise again to oscillate so much and the die out? Some questions regarding an observation of the case $a = 5$: Why does there seem to be a tiny bump just after the '4' on the x-axis? What value could be causing this, and why? And when $a = 7$, why do there seem to be tiny successive bumps beyond 2 and -2? I realize that answers may not exist for all of these questions, because these maybe the intrinsic qualities of the graph of the integral in discussion, but I'm hoping that some people may have insights and explanations for the features of the graphs I've questioned about.... Especially questions 3 and 4. I hope you don't consider the question silly; I'm genuinely interested in knowing the reasons (If they exist) for the above graphs.","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'integration', 'graphing-functions']"
1193356,Number of unique binary strings containing at least m sequential 1s,"Let $Z\left(n,m\right)$ be the number of unique binary strings of length $m$ containing at least one instance of $n$ consecutive 1's. I am trying to come up with an expression for $Z$, preferably directly calculable though I will accept a recursive solution as well. I have attempted a formulation based on [1] ,
$$ \hat{Z}\left(n,m\right) = \sum_{q=m}^{n}\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{q}{m}\rfloor}(-1)^{i+1}\binom{n-q+1}{i}\binom{n-mi}{n-q}\text{,}$$
however I am getting some discrepencies against test cases I worked out by hand. For example, it works for $Z\left(7,6\right)=3$ and $Z\left(7,5\right)=8$, but it does not work for $\left(7,4\right)=16$ (the formulation above gives $20$). N.B. : my definitions of $n$ and $m$ are opposite those of [1]; $q$ is the same. I believe it has something to do with double-counting some string permutations, but I haven't been able to work out what else I have to take out. Update : I found a recursive formulation [2] that gives me the same result as my $\hat{Z}$ above:
$$ \tilde{Z}\left(n,m\right) = 2\tilde{Z}\left(n-1,m\right) + 2^{n-m-1}-\tilde{Z}\left(n-m-1,m\right) $$
Having found this independent formulation, I will have to revisit my counting and see if I've made a mistake somewhere. Bonus points for an answer that works for arbitrary dictionaries, i.e. $W\left(a,n,m\right)$ where $a$ is the number of possible symbols in each position of the string. The original question would be equivalent to $Z\left(n,m\right) = W\left(2,n,m\right)$.

1193380,What constitutes an outcome in probability?,"In probability, I often have trouble determining which situations to take as distinct outcomes for calculation. For instance, if we have a die with its faces numbered $1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6$ and we roll it twice. We get $2$ on the first roll and $3$ on the second. Again rolling it twice we get $2$ and $3$. But the $2$ we got the second time is not the same $2$ as the first one. Its the other $2$ inscribed on the face of the die (the die has two $2$'s). So, for the purpose of calculating the probability that the sum of the two rolls in a die will be a certain number $4$, say, will these two situations constitute distinct outcomes? This is just a simplified, distilled example of a persistent problem I face in probability. Is there any way to think about outcomes that can make this clearer?",['probability']
1193398,Residue Theorem and Homologous to zero,"This is a very basic question and I couldn't find it posted yet but here it goes;
The Residue Theorem states that if $f:G\to \mathbb{C}$ is analytic on $G$- a region and $f$ has isolated singularities $b_1,...,b_k$ and $\gamma$ is homologous to 0, then $$\displaystyle\int_{\gamma}f=2\pi i\sum_1^kn(\gamma;b_s)\mathrm{Res}(f;b_s).$$ 
To my understanding, if $\gamma$ ""wraps"" around an isolated singularity, $b_i$, (say 1 time), then $\gamma$ would not be homologous to 0 since $n(\gamma;b_i)=1$ in this case ($b_i\in \mathbb{C}-G$).

Let $A=\left\{m+1, \ldots, 2m\right\}$ and let $\nu(i)$ be the number of times $i\in [2m]$ appears in the multiset. We're trying to find the number of multisets $\left\{1^{\nu(1)}, 2^{\nu(2)} \ldots, 2m^{\nu(2m)} \right\}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{2m}\nu(i)=n$ and $\nu(i)=2j_i$, for some $j_i\in \mathbb{N}$ where $i\in A$.

There are two cases: $\textbf{Case 1:}$ $j_i=0$ for all $i\in A$. In this case, $\sum_{i=1}^{2m} x_i=\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i=n$, which is a weak composition of $n$ into $m$ parts, of which there are $\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}$. $\textbf{Case 1:}$ $j_i=0$ for all $i\in S$, where $S\in \binom{A}{k}$ (i.e., $S\subseteq A$ such that $|S|=k$) and $j_i\geq 1$ for all $i\in A\setminus S$.

My attempt at a solution: I believe that because we are looking at probabilities on $[a,b]$, we automatically have that the sequence is tight. At which point I would like to apply Prohorov's Theorem, which would implies that the weak closure of the sequence is compact in the weak topology. But I have no idea what to do from here. Edit 1: I have made some progress. So, for a subsequence that converges weakly to $P$, say, $P_{n_k}$, whose existence we are guaranteed by Prohorov's Theorem, that subsequence converges weakly to some $P_k$.

E(\xi\cdot\xi_1)=\int_0^\infty x\cdot\min(x,2)\cdot\lambda\exp(-\lambda x) \,dx=
\int_0^2x^2\lambda e^{-\lambda x} \,dx+2\int_2^\infty x\lambda e^{-\lambda x} \,dx=\int_0^{2\lambda} \lambda^{-2} t^2e^{-t}\,dt +\frac{2}{\lambda}\int_{2\lambda}^{\infty}te^{-t}\,dt=\frac{-e^{-t}(t^2+2t+2)}{\lambda^2}|_{t=0}^{2\lambda}+\frac{-2(1+t)e^{-t}}{\lambda}|_{t=2\lambda}^{\infty}=\frac{2}{\lambda^2}(1-e^{-2\lambda}(\lambda+1)).
$$
Next
$$
E(\xi_1)=\int_0^{\infty}\min(x,2)\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\,dx=\int_0^2 x\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\,dx+2\int_2^\infty\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\,dx=\lambda^{-1} \int_0^{2 \lambda}te^{-t}\,dt+\int_{2\lambda}^{\infty}2e^{-t}\,dt=\frac{-e^{-t}(1+t)}{\lambda}|_{t=0}^{2\lambda}-2e^{-t}|_{t=2\lambda}^{\infty}=\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda}(1+2\lambda)}{\lambda}+2e^{-2\lambda}=\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda}}{\lambda}.
$$
Hence
$$
Cov(\xi,\xi_1)=E(\xi\cdot\xi_1)-E\xi\cdot E\xi_1=\frac{2}{\lambda^2}(1-e^{-2\lambda}(\lambda+1))-\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda}}{\lambda^2}=\frac{1-e^{-2\lambda}-2\lambda e^{-2\lambda}}{\lambda^2}

1193723,Why do we define curves on manifolds via the objects $\phi\circ\gamma$?,"Consider the following definition: ($M$ denotes a manifold structure, $U$ are subsets of the manifold and $\phi$ the transition functions) Def :   A smooth curve in $M$ is a map $\gamma: I \rightarrow M,$ where $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is an open interval, such that for any chart $(U,\phi)$, the map $\phi \circ \gamma : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is smooth. My first question is, why do we define a smooth curve in this way? In particular, why is the map $\phi \circ \gamma$ a good object to consider? The only thing that comes to mind is that now we have a function defined from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ so differentiation is well defined and thus one may introduce the concept of a tangent vector (as below). Now let $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function on $M$ and $\gamma: I \rightarrow M$, smooth curve as before. Then $f \circ \gamma : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is smooth. Hence we take a derivative to find the rate of change of $f$ along the curve $\gamma$: $$\frac{d}{dt}f(\gamma(t)) = [(f \circ \phi^{-1}) \circ (\phi \circ \gamma)]'(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial (f \circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial x^i}\right)_{\phi(\gamma(t))} \frac{d}{dt} x^i(\gamma(t))$$ My next question is to simply understand how this equation comes about. I can see it is some application of the chain rule but I am struggling with the precise details of the equation, mostly in how the final equality comes about and the subscript on the  $\partial (f \circ \phi^{-1})/\partial x^i$  term.

f(g(x)) = x \implies f = g^{[-1]}
$$ I have been told: $$
f^{[-1]\prime}(f^\prime(c)) = \dfrac{1}{f^\prime(c)}

I'm not familiar with the formal name of this truth, so knowing that would be a start on being able to find material from which to study it. Edit: The problem only defines $f^\prime(x)$. It doesn't define $f^\prime(g(x))$. The formula which was derived is relative to functions, their inverses, and their respective derivatives. It is not necessarily so that $f‚Ä≤(x) = f‚Ä≤(g(x))$. So, how could it be shown that $g'(x) = \dfrac 1 {f'(g(x))} = \dfrac 1 {1+f(g(x))^2} = \dfrac 1 {1+x^2}$ when we don't know what $f^\prime(g(x))$ or $g^\prime(x)$ is?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'functions']"
1193740,Centralizers of reflections in parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups,"Let us consider a (not necessarily finite) Coxeter group $W$ generated by a finite set of involutions $S=\{s_1,...,s_n\}$ subject (as usual) to the relations $(s_is_j)^{m_{i,j}}$ with $m_{i,j}=m_{j,i}$ and  $m_{i,j}=1$ if and only if $i=j$ (if necessary you may also assume that $m_{i,j}<\infty$ for all $i,j$). Let $P\leq W$ be a subgroup generated by all but one of the $s_i$, say wlog $P=\langle s_1,...,s_{n-1}\rangle$. I am interested in the centralizer of $s_n$ in $P$. In particular I would like to know if $C_P(s_n)=C_W(s_n) \cap P=\langle s_i~|~ 1\leq i\leq n-1, m_{i,n}=2\rangle=:Z$ always holds. Obviously this is true if $n=2$ and I believe (though I have not written it down rigorously) I can prove it for Coxeter groups of type $A_n$ by using the standard isomorphism to $S_n$. On the other hand the centralizer of $s_n$ in $W$ is not necessarily a standard parabolic subgroup (look at the dihedral group of order $8$ for example). There are some results on centralizers of reflections in Coxeter groups and on normalizers/centralizers of parabolic subgroups (which is the same in this special case) to be found in the literature but most deal with the centralizer in $W$. In principal it should be possible to obtain the centralizer in $P$ from these results by simply taking the intersection but the results I found so far are not explicit/ simple enough for this to be a feasible solution. Edit: Some thoughts so far: I can show that elements of $C_P(s_n)$ of length $1$ or $2$ already lie in $Z$ (the case $1$ being trivial) and that elements of $C_P(s_n)$ of length $3$ where all three occurring simple reflections are pairwise distinct already belong to $Z$. On the other hand look at $s_1s_2s_1 \in C_P(s_n)$ which centralizes $s_n$ if and only if $s_2$ centralizes $s_1s_ns_1$. I don't see any reason why this should not be the case so I tried constructing a counterexample consisting of $s_1,s_2$ and $s_3$ such that $s_1,s_2$ do not commute and $s_1s_3$ do not commute but $s_2$ and $s_1s_3s_1$ do.

1193772,Why the mean value of a Gaussian process is usually set to zero?,"In most textbooks (e.g. Rasmussen's book on Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning) the mean value of a gaussian process is set to zero. Of course, this does not mean that all the values are expected to be zero since we are looking for the Maximum a Posteriori estimate of these variables, which do not have any more a zero mean. Is there a mathematically robust proof or at least an explanation based on mathematics that the assumption of the zero mean value is not too prohibitive for the a posteriori estimate? To make things a bit more clear, assume that we have the following model where the noise $e$ is uncorrelated with $f(x)$: $y= f(x) +e $, $f(x) \sim \mathcal{N} (m, K)$, $e \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \sigma^2)$. Then the a posteriori (which is actually the MAP estimate) is given by $\mathbb{E} (f | y) = m + K (\sigma^2 I + K)^{-1} (y-m)$ The way I see it, by setting the mean equal to zero we usually reduce the number of hyperparameters that have to be estimated, because most of the times the mean is also unknown, so it has to be parametrized by some hyperparameters and then these hyperparameters have to be estimated by a non-convex optimization routine, thus increasing the computational burden. However, this does not explain mathematically if the assumption that the mean is zero does not restrict too much the a posteriori estimate.

As far as I understand, in differential geometry $dx^{i}$ is a linear functional that maps vectors in a tangent space $T_{p}M$ at a point $p\in M$ on a manifold $M$ to the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $$dx^{i} :T_{p}M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$ In this sense the differential form $dx^{i}$ maps a vector $v\in T_{p}M$ to its $i^{th}$ coordinate with respect to the coordinate basis $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$, i.e. $dx^{i}(v)=v^{i}$. In elementary calculus I was always told when I asked the question ""what is $dx$?"" , that it is an infinitesimal change in the x-coordinate . This has never rested easy with me as e.g. if we have the formula $$ df=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\Delta f = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}f'(x)\Delta x $$ then due to the properties of limits this can be expressed as $$\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}f'(x)\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\Delta x$$ and clearly $\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\Delta x =0$ which seems inconsistent.

I need to show that $TS^1$ is diffeomorphic to $S^1\times \mathbf R$. (I am using the concept of derivations to define the tangent spaces.)

for all $p=(p_1,p_2)\in S^1$ and all $\lambda\in \mathbf R$, and show that this is a diffeomorphism. My problem with this is that: $\left(p_2
\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{p}-p_1\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\right|_p
\right)$ is not really a member of $T_pS_1$. It lies in $di_p(T_pS^1)\subseteq T_p\mathbf R^2$, where $i:S^1\to \mathbf R^2$ is the inclusion map. (Reason: The manifold structure of $S_1$ is governed by the fact that $i:S^1\to \mathbf R^2$ is a smooth embedding, and thus, a tangent vector $X_p\in T_p\mathbf R^2$ is in $di_p(T_pS^1)$ if an only if $X_p\xi=0$ for all $\xi\in \mathcal C^\infty(\mathbf R^2)$ with $\xi|S^1\equiv 0$.)

as
$G(p, a_1, a_2)=(p, \sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2})$. We note that $G$ is smooth. Finally, since $i:S^1\to T\mathbf R^2$ is smooth (it is more than that), we have $di:TS^1\to T\mathbf R^2$ is also smooth. Now $G\circ F\circ di: TS^1\to S^1\times \mathbf R$ is thus a smooth map, since composition of smooth maps is smooth. But I am unable to show that this map is the required diffeomorphism.

1194313,"A rigorous meaning of ""induced measure""?","In my readings I often come across terms like ""induced measure"" or ""induced Lebesgue measure"". For example: $$\int_{\mathbb{B}^n}u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\;dx = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}uv\frac{x_j}{|x|}\;d\sigma - \int_{\mathbb{B}^n}v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_j}\;dx$$ where $d\sigma$ denotes the induced Lebesgue measure on the sphere. Unfortunately though, I've never really seen anyone give a rigorous definition to this phrase. Sure, in the above example, we understand how to parametrize the $n$ ball, $\mathbb{B}^n$, and the $n-1$ sphere, $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, and so the integrals are easy to compute and not very confusing. Sometimes, however, it appears in the context of a general hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (say $\Sigma$, with integrals involving $d\Sigma$), or when integrating over a subset (submanifold) of some higher-dimensional  space. In a completely general setting like this, I am at a little bit of a loss when it comes to understanding  how these separate ""surface"" measures or ""induced"" measures are really defined, when I'm lacking an explicit parametrization. It also doesn't help that traditional vector calculus classes seem to always fall short of doing anything past 3 dimensions. For example, I've never seen a class teach its students how to carry out a (2-D) surface integral in anything except $\mathbb{R}^3$; so they would have no idea how to go about finding the surface area of, say a Clifford Torus in $\mathbb{R}^4$. And in general, I've never seen them address a general technique for integrating over an $n$-dimensional body, embedded in $n<m$-dimensional space. It seems like everything they're taught is in terms of the cross product, which fails to be of any use in $\mathbb{R}^{n>3}$. Now I realize that at least some of the hypersurface examples from calculus, that I've mentioned above, can be addressed using the generalized Stokes' theorem: $\int_{D}\text{d}\omega = \int_{\partial D}\omega$. But it seems to me that when we are getting to the realm of measure theory, higher-level analysis, and Riemannian geometry, the word ""induced"" is probably thrown around for a good reason. Let me clarify what I mean: If we are on a Riemannian manifold $M$, then its metric $g$ defines a volume element for the the manifold, $dV_g = \sqrt{\det g}\;dV$, where $dV$ is the Euclidean measure for your coordinate patch in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If we then consider an immersed submanifold $N\hookrightarrow M$, we have a rigourous definition for the induced metric that $N$ inherits from $M$. If we have a topological space $(X,\tau)$, then it induces a subspace topology on any subset $Y\subset X$, $\tau_Y = \{Y\cap U : U\in\tau\}$. Similarly for any subset $Y\subset X$ of a $\sigma$-algebra $(X,\Sigma)$, we have the sub-$\sigma$-algebra $(Y,\Sigma_Y), \Sigma_Y = \{Y\cap A : A\in\Sigma\}$. In these settings, the word "" induced "" has a very specific meaning, and essentially boils down to the idea of a subset inheriting some sort of property from a larger set it belongs to. So it would make sense that there should be some concrete way of having a measure space induce some kind of measure on a subset of itself. At first glance, since a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ can give rise to a sub-$\sigma$-algebra (as mentioned above) then you might want to simply take the restriction of $\mu$ to these subsets in $\Sigma_Y$. But the problem is that any subset $E$, without full dimension, will of course have measure zero, $\mu(E)=0$. So this would make for a lousy way to define integration over this subset. So maybe we only concern ourselves with Riemannian manifolds, and just define the induced measure as the one that arrises from the induced metric of some parent manifold. But this seems limiting for a couple reasons: Integration is now limited to Riemannian manifolds, and no longer over a general measure space. For example, while integration with respect to the counting measure makes sense over $\mathbb{N}$, I can't see any way to interpret this as integration over a Riemannian manifold; and so the question of how the counting measure ""induces"" another measure would be meaningless. If we consider a (smooth) subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, we can build a measure space on $S$ from scratch, similar to how we build the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in measure theory. My question then is: are we always able to realize integration (with respect to this measure) over $S$ as integration with respect to some induced metric, by considering $S\subset M$, for some manifold $(M,g)$? To me, a measure (and anything that it induces) should be in the spirit of measurable sets, and not be restricted to differential manifolds. The Lebesgue measure $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ gives us the volume of the unit ball as $\frac{4}{3}\pi$; shouldn't $\mu$ induce a measure on $\mathbb{S}^2$, to give us $4\pi$ surface area? And whatever method we choose, shouldn't it apply to abstract measures as well, not just Lebesgue measure?","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'integration']"

1194481,Notation of author-defined functions.,"I have seen functions defined various ways, and I'm wondering which form I should use for some functions. I am hoping to learn what it might be read as, interpreted, etc. The most common definition of a function is by far $f(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$, for example, $f(a,b,c)=\frac{a^b-c^a}{abc}$. I assume that this is read as ""(the) $f$ of $a,b, $ and $c$"". I have seen another definition as $R_z$, for example, $C_n$ is the cyclic graph with $n$ vertices. I have interpreted this to refer to some special element of a larger set, as opposed to $f(x)$, which to me connotes a routine of sorts. A symbol is often used to denote some function, for example, $\bigcup_{\{x_i\}_{i\in I }}$, $\mathbb{Z}_n$, and $\sum_{i=0}^{12}i^2-i$. I'm not entirely sure when to use this. The last definition I have seen is $f(x;y)$. I have seen this only in some probability functions, and, with my limited exposure, I interpreted it to mean ""$f$ of $x$ with respect to $y$"" or something similar. My question is this: When should I use each notation? Are there any other ways of denoting a function? I wish to define a large number of functions, and I wonder which cases would require each notation.","['notation', 'functions']"

1194537,Question on calculating curvature of a surface given implicitly,"I want to find, as an exercise, an expression for the curvature of a surface given by the zero set of a function. I reached a final expression, but when I test it for a sphere I get a non-constant expression. I know I'm doing a step wrong, but I don't know why. Below is what I have. Say we have a good enough $f:\Bbb R^3 \to \Bbb R$. This defines a surface in $\Bbb R^3$ as $$S = \{(x,y,z)\in\Bbb R^3 : f(x,y,z) = 0\}$$ Suppose that $f_z = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\neq 0$. Then by the implicit function theorem it's easy enough to see we have a local parametrization of $S$ (in fact, the graph of a function): $$h:\Bbb R^2\to \Bbb R^3 \atop (x,y)\mapsto (x,y,h(x,y))$$
and $h$ satisfies (found using the chain rule on $f(x,y,h(x,y)) = 0$) $$\begin{align}h_x = \frac{-f_x}{f_z} \\ h_y = \frac{-f_y}{f_z}\end{align}$$ This way we have a basis for $T_pS$ (at a point $p$ which is omitted in the expressions) $(1,0,-f_x/f_z), (0,1,-f_y/f_z)$. With the usual notation, the coefficients of the first fundamental form $I$ can be calculated as $$E = 1+(f_x/f_z)^2, F = \frac{f_xf_y}{f_z^2}, G = 1 + (f_y/f_z)^2$$
My problem, it seems, comes with the second fundamental form $II$. For example, my calculation of $h_{xx}$ results in $$h_{xx} = \frac{f_xf_{xz}-f_{xx}f_z}{f_z^2}$$
while on this page they get $$h_{xx} = \frac{2f_xf_zf_{xz}-f_x^2f_{zz}-f_z^2f_{xx}}{f_z^3}$$ so either something is horribly wrong and I've forgotten how to differentiate a quotient, or there's something else in the calculation I'm not including. Note that this is before doing anything with the normal vector, just partial derivatives of the parametrization.

I have $\dot \gamma(t)=(\sin t, \cos t ,1)$, my next step was to compute $g'(t)$, I obtained that $$g'(t)= \sin t \frac{\partial f( \gamma(t))}{\partial x}+ \cos t \frac{\partial f ( \gamma(t))}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial f(\gamma(t))}{\partial z} $$

1194762,Mental Primality Testing,"At a trivia night, the following question was posed: ""What is the smallest 5 digit prime?"" Teams (of 4) were given about a minute to write down their answer to the question. Obviously, the answer is googleable, so I'm not asking what the answer to the trivia question is, but rather: how could a team quickly find the answer without previous knowledge of it? If you wanted to try solving the trivia question yourself, don't read any further, as I will start discussing the answer and ruling out other numbers now. My thoughts so far: If you know your slide rules, you expect that prime density is close to $ln(10,000)$ or about 10%. So, a reasonable approach would be to focus on numbers 10,000 through 10,010. Really, what matters is that (I assume) you start at 10,000, factor as many numbers in a row as you can, and then guest the first number you haven't factored. We can rule out a lot with easy divisibility tests, leaving 10001, 10003, 10007, and 10009. Assuming one of your people is fast with division or knows better divisibility rules, 10003 is also eliminated because it has a small divisor (7). This shouldn't require a special technique. We're now left with 3 numbers that reasonable divisibility tests won't handle. It turns out 10,001 is composite, while 10,007 and 10,009 are both prime. But the smaller factor of 10,001 is 73, which is the 21st prime. If the team could do the above steps and then rule out 10,001 by dividing by the first 21 primes (also assuming they know the first 21 primes), they would presumably guess 10,007 thereby being right (though not necessarily confident in their answer). But, let's assume that 21 divisions aren't quite possible. Is there a faster way? Let's say that either a test that quickly determines that 10,001 is likely composite or a test that determines that 10,007 is likely prime is sufficient, since we might be down to some guess work at this point, but bonus points if we can know for sure 10,001 is composite or know for sure 10,007 is prime, and extra bonus points if we do both! There are potentially approaches that don't rely on ruling out 10,001. For example, I had the idea initially that given that 10,001, 10,007, and 10,009 are each hard to divide, maybe it's fairly likely that 10,007 and 10,009 are twin primes, and therefore it is more likely that 10,007 is a prime than 10,001 and so you would guess it anyway. While 10,007 and 10,009 do turn out to be twin primes, I don't actually think that the assertion holds, and this seems more like luck.","['primality-test', 'mental-arithmetic', 'divisibility', 'number-theory']"

Then is it true that for any Borel-measurable function $g: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, we have that $\mathbb{E}(g(X,Y)|\mathcal{H})=\mathbb{E}(g(X,Y)|X)$?
