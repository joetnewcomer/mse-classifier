1340659,Calculate in closed form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\arctan(1/n) H_n}{n}$,"Playing with Taylor series is not helpful enough. What else would you try out? $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\arctan(1/n) H_n}{n}$$

It's easy to see the series converges since $\arctan(1/n) \approx 1/n$ when $n$ large.
Maybe its integral representation makes us feel more comfortable $$1/4\int_0^1 \frac{ 2(\gamma  \pi  x \coth (\pi  x)+\gamma) +i x \left(\psi ^{(0)}(-i x)^2-\psi ^{(0)}(i x)^2-\psi ^{(1)}(-i x)+\psi ^{(1)}(i x)\right)}{ x^2} \, dx$$","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

1340732,"When proving that f(z) is a polynomial, is it enough to consider just one point instead of keeping z arbitrary?","I think so - but I'd rather ask the MSE community too. Say I am given the bound |f(z)| < $|z|^3$, and that f is entire.  Show f must be a polynomial. I used Cauchy's Integral Formula for derivatives and showed that for n>3, all of the derivatives are zero, when we let the closed contour grow to infinity. But, I have only used CIF at the point z = 0 - I didn't keep z arbitrary. Then the CIF shows that, at z = 0, the Taylor series has only finitely many terms and so f(z) must be a polynomial. So I feel there's actually no need to apply the CIF to an arbitrary z. We have enough information on f(z) just from looking at z=0.

1340753,Best estimate using Cauchy integral formula: why is a circle the optimal path?,"I once encountered this question from Ahlfors' Complex Analysis. An analytic function $f$ has the property that for $|z|<1$, $|f(z)|\leq \frac{1}{1-|z|}$. Find the best estimate of $|f^{(n)}(0)|$ that Cauchy's formula will yield. I solved it by finding an estimate via the Cauchy integral formula over a circle of general radius and then optimized the result by differentiating it with respect to the radius. I later wondered, why should we expect the optimal path to be a circle? I applied the Euler-Lagrange Equations to this problem and got a completely untractable O.D.E. I expect that a circle is the optimal path, but is there a concrete reason why? Edit Here is my application of the Euler-Lagrange equations: Suppose we want to integrate on a path $\gamma(t)=r(t)e^{i\theta(t)}$ for $0\leq t\leq 1$ with the stipulation the $\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)$ and $0<r(t)<1$. This leaves us with $|f(z)|<\frac{1}{1-r(t)}$, and $|dz|=|r'(t)+ir(t)\theta'(t)|dt.$ Then the problem is to minimize
$$|f^{(n)}(0)|\leq\frac{n!}{2\pi}\int_0^1\frac{1}{r^{n+1}(t)(1-r(t))}|r'(t)+ir\theta'(t)|dt.$$ It is sufficient that we optimize the integrand. Let the integrand be written $$F(r,\theta,r',\theta')=\frac{\sqrt{r'(t)^2+r(t)^2\theta'(t)^2}}{r^{n+1}(t)(1-r(t))}.$$ I simply apply the variational derivative:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial r}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial F}{\partial r'}=0,$$
$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta'}=0.$$ As much as I hate to spoil the joy of working out the differential equations on your own, I have computed them form you: $$\frac{r(t)^{-n} \theta '(t) \left(r(t) \theta '(t) \left(r(t) \left(r''(t)-n \theta '(t)^2\right)+(n+1) r(t)^2 \theta '(t)^2-r''(t)\right)+(n r(t)-n+1) r'(t)^2 \theta '(t)-(r(t)-1) r(t) r'(t) \theta ''(t)\right)}{(r(t)-1)^2 \left(r'(t)^2+r(t)^2 \theta '(t)^2\right)^{3/2}}=0,$$
$$-\frac{r(t)^{-n} r'(t) \left(r(t) \theta '(t) \left(r(t) \left(r''(t)-n \theta '(t)^2\right)+(n+1) r(t)^2 \theta '(t)^2-r''(t)\right)+(n r(t)-n+1) r'(t)^2 \theta '(t)-(r(t)-1) r(t) r'(t) \theta ''(t)\right)}{(r(t)-1)^2 \left(r'(t)^2+r(t)^2 \theta '(t)^2\right)^{3/2}}=0$$ It is not too hard to see that these reduce to equations solved by the result for the circle assuming that $r'(t)=0$ and $\theta'(t)=\text{const}$. Thus, the circle I initially found is a stationary point, but it may not be unique. I am stymied at the prospect of finding other solutions.",['complex-analysis']

1340856,Using Multiple Scale Analysis to solve a non-linear differential equation,"I would like to know if there are other methods to solve equations such as this one below. I don't really understand the theory behind the multiple scale analysis and why it works I understand some of the reasoning behind it just not the proof and theory. I kind of chose a differential equation for which I think it works and tried it out following a example from a similar equation. I think the answer seems strange but I was very thorough in my calculations. I welcome any comments or advice to problems like these thanks! \begin{equation}u^{''} +\omega_0^2u=-2\epsilon \mu u^{'}-\epsilon u^2 u^{'} + \epsilon k \cos \Omega t\end{equation}
First we introduce two time variables (fast and slow) and define them as \begin{equation}T_0=t\;\;\;T_1=\epsilon t\end{equation} where $T_0$ is the fast time scale and $T_1$ is the slow time scale. The first order expansion of the problem is \begin{equation}u(t)=u_0(T_0,T_1)+\epsilon u_1(T_0,T_1)\end{equation} Differentiating the time derivative becomes \begin{align}
\frac{du}{dt}=\frac{\partial u_0}{\partial T_0} \frac{dT_0}{dt}(1)+(\epsilon) \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial T_1} \frac{dT_1}{dt}=\frac{\partial u_0}{\partial T_0}+\epsilon \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial T_1}
\end{align} 
Define the linear operators, and functions \begin{equation} D_0=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial T_0},\hspace{10pt} D_1=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial T_1}\end{equation} The time derivative becomes $\dfrac{d}{dt}=D_0+\epsilon D_1$. The second order time derivative is then expressed as 
\begin{equation}\frac{d^2}{dt^2}=(D_0+\epsilon D_1)^2=D_0^2+2D_0D_1 \epsilon +\epsilon ^2 D_1^2\end{equation} The $\epsilon ^2$ term is neglected. We are now ready to substitute our results in the original equation to obtain, 
\pagebreak $$(D_0^2+2\epsilon D_0 D_1)(u_0+\epsilon u_1)+\omega^2_0(u_0+\epsilon u_1)=-2\epsilon \mu (D_0+ \epsilon D_1)(u_0+\epsilon u_1)-$$$$\epsilon (u_0+\epsilon u_1)^2(D_0+\epsilon D_1)(u_0+\epsilon u_1) + \epsilon k \cos \Omega t$$
$$\implies (D_0^2u_0+\epsilon D^2_0  u_1+2\epsilon D_1D_0 u_0 +2\epsilon ^2D_0 D_1 u_1^2)+\omega_0^2u_0+\epsilon \omega_0^2  u_1=-2 \epsilon \mu D_0u_0-2\epsilon^2\mu (...)$$ $$-\epsilon u^2_0D_0u_0+\epsilon^2(...)+\epsilon k \cos \Omega t
$$
\begin{equation}\implies D_0 u_0+ \epsilon D_0 u_1 +2 \epsilon D_1 D_0 u_0+ \omega_0^2 u_0+\epsilon \omega_0^2 u_1=-2\epsilon \mu D_0 u_0-\epsilon u_0^2D_0u_0+\epsilon k \cos \Omega t\end{equation}
Now we construct a system of differential equations in powers of $\epsilon$ called zero-order and first order problems and given by,
\begin{align} D_0^2u_0+\omega_0^2u_0=0\end{align} \begin{align} D^2u_1 +\omega_0^2u_1=-2D_1D_0 u_0-2\mu D_0u_0-u_0^2D_0u_0+k \cos \Omega t \end{align} The first equation is a second order linear, homogeneous equation with constant coefficients and has general solution
 \begin{equation}u_0(T_0,T_1)=A(T_1)e^{i\omega_0T_0}+\bar{A}(T_1)e^{-i\omega_0T_0}\end{equation}
 where $A(T_1)$ is the complex amplitude afterwards. Our next step is to investigate primary resonance of the system, which occurs when the actuation frequency $\Omega$ is near the natural frequency, $\omega_0$. This can be written as
 \begin{align}\Omega=\omega_0+\epsilon \sigma\\ \Omega T_0=\omega T_0 +\epsilon T_0 \sigma\\\Omega t= \omega T_0+T_1\sigma \end{align} We substitute $u_0$ into the equation (2) to get, 
\begin{equation*}D_0^2u_1+\omega_0^2u_1= -2D_0D_1[A(T_1)e^{i \omega_0 T_0}+\bar{A}(T_1)e^{-i \omega T_0}]-2\mu D_0[A(T_1)e^{i\omega_0T_0}+\bar{A}(T_1)e^{-i \omega T_0}]- \end{equation*}\begin{equation} [A(T_1)e^{i\omega_0T_0}+\bar{A}(T_1)e^{-i\omega T_0}]^2D_0u_0+k\frac{e^{i \omega_0 T_0}e^{i\sigma T_1}+e^{-i\omega_0T_1}e^{-i\sigma T_1}}{2}\end{equation} Thus applying the linear operations to the above to get $$-2[A^{'}e^{i\omega_0T_0}(i\omega_0)+\bar{A}^{'}e^{-i\omega_0T_0}(-i\omega_0)]-2\mu[Ae^{i\omega_0 T_0}(i\omega_0)+\bar{A}e^{-i\omega_0T_0}(-i\omega_0)]+$$$$\bigg(-A^2e^{2i\omega_0T_0}-2A\bar{A}-\bar{A}^2e^{-2i\omega T_0}\bigg)\bigg(Ae^{i\omega_0T_0}(i\omega_0)-\bar{A}e^{-i\omega_0T_0}(i\omega_0)\bigg)+\frac{k}{2}\bigg(e^{i(\omega T_0+\sigma T_1)}+e^{-i(\omega_0 T_0+\sigma T_1)}\bigg)$$

Secular terms are nonhomogenous terms that make the function unbounded they are inconsistent with the behavior of the physical system, thus they must be eliminated. A term is secular if it is a solution of the homogenous equation.  Therefore, the sum of the coefficient of $e^{i \omega T_0}$ must be $0$. $$-2A^{'}(i\omega_0)-2\mu A(i\omega_0)-A^2\bar{A}(i\omega_0)+\dfrac{k}{2}e^{i\sigma T_1}=0$$
$$e^{-i\beta}\bigg(-a^{'}(i\omega_0)e^{i\beta}+a\beta^{'}\omega_0e^{i\beta}-\mu ae^{i\beta}(i\omega_0)-\frac{1}{8}a^3e^{i\beta}(i\omega_0)+\frac{k}{2}e^{-i\sigma T_1})=0\bigg)

\begin{equation}-a^{'}(i\omega_0)+a\beta^{'}\omega_0-\mu a(i \omega_0)-\frac{1}{8}a^3(i \omega_0) +\frac{k}{2}\bigg(\cos(\sigma T_1-\beta)+i\sin(\sigma T-\beta)\bigg)=0\end{equation}
For the entire function to be zero Real and Imaginary parts must be 0.  \begin{equation}a\beta^{'}\omega_0+\frac{k}{2}\cos(\sigma T_1-\beta)=0
\end{equation} \begin{equation}-a\omega_0-\frac{1}{8}a^3\omega_0 + \sin(\sigma T_1-\beta)-\mu a \omega_0=0\end{equation}
We make a change of variables and set $\gamma=\sigma T_1-\beta$ so that $\beta^{'}=\sigma T_1-\gamma^{'}$. Therefore we have that,
\begin{equation}a\gamma^{'}=a\sigma +\frac{k}{2\omega_0}\cos \gamma\end{equation}
\begin{equation}a^{'}=-\mu a-\frac{1}{8}a^3+ \frac{\sin \gamma}{\omega_0}\end{equation}

1340973,Can a fractal be a manifold? if so: will its boundary (if exists) be strictly one dimension lower?,"So it is weekend! and I am reading a nice book, ""The Poincaré conjecture"", written by a mathematician (Donal O'Shea, topologist). The book introduces step by step basic concepts of Topology, and talks about the mathematical advances since Poincaré stated the conjecture up to the moment it was demonstrated, providing a glimpse of the solution that Perelman gave to the conjecture. It is not technical, narrative, a very light reading. My question is about the following: when the author defines a manifold, states that ""if a manifold has a boundary, its boundary will be one dimension lower"". Then I thought about fractals, for instance: can a fractal be a manifold? (I understand that manifold means the same as ""surface"" in this context) and then, if the answer is yes, then if it has boundaries, are the boundaries strictly one dimension lower?

Define $$\Gamma := \{S\in\mathcal{B}(X)\,|\,S\circ T=T\circ S\}$$and define, for each $y\in X$, $$\Gamma(y):=\{S(y)\,|\,S\in\Gamma\}$$ I am trying to prove that $\Gamma(y)\in Closed(X)$ for each $y\in X$. I have already proven that $\Gamma \in Closed(\mathcal{B}(X))$, which was easy, but I don't see how from that it follows that $\Gamma(y)$ is closed. This is part of theorem $\boxed{10.35}$ (""Lomonosolv's Invariant Subspace Theorem"") in Rudin's Functional Analysis book. What I have tried: I tried to take a convergent sequence in $\Gamma(y)$ and show it converges to a point necessarily within $\Gamma(y)$. That entails taking a sequence of points in $\Gamma$, $\{S_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that the limit exits in $X$: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n(y)$$Now if it would be possible to show that $\{S_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to some $S\in\Gamma$ then we would be finished. However, I'm not sure how to use the data to show that, because in order for $\{S_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ to converge you need to know something about, let's say, $||S_{n_1}-S_{n_2}|| $ whereas you only know something about $||S_{n_1}(y)-S_{n_2}(y)||$ and you then only have $||S_{n_1}(y)-S_{n_2}(y)||\leq||S_{n_1}-S_{n_2}||||y|| $ by linearity. I tried to define a mapping $\Psi_y:\mathcal{B}(X)\to X$ by $S\mapsto S(y)$. Then $\Psi$ is linear and continuous. The goal would be to prove $\Psi_y$ is a closed mapping, but I am not sure how to do that.","['banach-algebras', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
1341014,"Another Evaluation of the Ramsey number $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)$","The problem Show that $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)=17$ The story behind the problem and some notation It was first proven by Greenwood and Gleason in 1955 in their paper Combinatorial relations and chromatic graphs . Later, in 1984 Sun and Cohen published an easy proof of the Greenwood-Gleason evaluation of the Ramsey number $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)$ . I can understand this proof, but I don't like it, because in my opinion it lacks intuition. Instead, I found another proof of the above result in Problems in Combinatorics and Graph Theory book by Ioan Tomescu (page 324). Firstly, let me explain the notation, which I used above: Ramsey's Theorem for c colors states that: For every positive integer $c \geq 2$ and positive integers $n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c} \geq 2$ there exists a (minimal) positive integer $\mathcal{R}(n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c})$ with the following property: If we color the edges of a complete graph of $\mathcal{R}(n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c})$ vertices with colors $1,2, \cdots , c$ then for some $i \in \{1,2, \cdots c\}$ there exists a complete subgraph with $n_{i}$ vertices whose edges are $i$ -colored. So, to prove $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)=17$ , we have to 3-color the edges of a $K_{16}$ avoiding monochromatic triangles. The three colored $K_{16}$ without monochromatic triangles that you get from Sun and Cohen's coloring is the following $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)>16$ ""> My question Tomescu in his proof uses the following coloring: Let $P$ be a pentagon and $M=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ the set of its vertices. Let $X$ be the set of vertices of the graph $K_{16}$ and $Y$ be the set of subsets of $M$ with even cardinality. Let $f$ be any bijection from $X$ to $Y$ . The edges of $K_{16}$ will be colored as follows: If $a,b \in X$ and $a \neq b$ color the edge joining $a$ and $b$ according to the following rule: with color $c_{1}$ if $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ is a side of $P$ with color $c_{2}$ if $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ is a diagonal of $P$ with color $c_{3}$ if $|f(a) \triangle f(b)|=4$ where $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ represents the symmetric difference between the vertex sets $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ , which must clearly be an even number of vertices of $P$ , and in the case of 2 vertices we treat it as an edge. I am having trouble understanding the argument that he uses in order to prove that there are no monochromatic triangles by contradiction. The argument goes like this: Suppose that there is a triangle with sides colored $c_{1}$ and having vertices $a,b,c$ . It can be seen that $f(a) \triangle f(b), f(a) \triangle f(c)$ and $f(b) \triangle f(c)$ are sides of the polygon $P$ . 
      But $$(f(a) \triangle f(b)) \triangle (f(b) \triangle f(c)) = f(a) \triangle f(c)$$ and thus $ f(a) \triangle f(c)$ cannot be a side of the polygon $P$ . In fact, if the sides $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ and $f(b) \triangle f(c)$ have a common vertex, then their symmetric difference is a diagonal of the pentagon $P$ and hence  the edge joining $a$ and $c$ is colored $c_{2}$ . If the sides have no common vertex, then their symmetric difference has cardinality 4 and thus the edge joining $a$ and $c$ is colored $c_{3}$ , which is a contradiction. An analogos argument can be used if it is supposed that the monochromatic triangle is colored $c_{2}$ or $c_{3}$ . Why $ f(a) \triangle f(c)$ cannot be a side of the polygon? Why is it true that if two sides have a common vertex then its symmetric difference is a diagonal? Why is it true that if they do not have a common vertex then its symmetric difference is of cardinality 4?

1341063,principal curvature of the flat torus,"I am looking at the Hopf-fibration and I am looking at the preimage of the equator in $\mathbb{S}^2$. I think that I have proved that this is just the flat torus and now I want to calculate the principal curvatures of this torus. My general approach to the problem has been: I consider $\mathbb{R}^4$ as $\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^3$ to be ""the unit circle"" in this ""plane"", every point on the circle determines a line through the origion. And the lines through the origion intersects the sphere in a unique circle. Mapping $\mathbb{S^3}$ to the space of lines through the origion gives me an onto map to $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ which I diffeomorphically identify with $\mathbb{S}^2$. The preimage of any point $(z_1:z_2)$ in $\mathbb{S}^3$ is just the circle $\frac{z_1}{z_2}=z$. Hence the preimage of the equator is all circles satisfying $\frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}=1$, i.e $|z_1|=|z_2|$, hence the preimage is a product of two circles, i.e a torus. Since my torus is just $S^1\times S^1$ in $\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}$ it is equipped with the product metric, and hence in this case flat. I am now stuck, here is two ways I would like to go forward: Calculating the Weingarten map. 
Using the parametrization $(e^{i\theta },e^{i\psi })$, what is the normal direction inside of $\mathbb{S}^3$? I have also tried to look at the normal curvature of curves in $S^1\times S^1$ are these just ""circles wrapping around the torus"" the smaller ones curving more then the bigger?

1341254,"About the integral $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log(x)\log^2(1+x)}{x}\,dx$","I came across the following Integral and have been completely stumped by it. $$\large\int_{0}^{1}\dfrac{\log(x)\log^2(1+x)}{x}dx$$ I'm extremely sorry, but the only thing I noticed was that the limits of the Integral were similar to the Beta function. I also got a hint that solving it would require the Polylogarithm, Gamma and the Riemann Zeta Functions.
$$$$Would it be possible to solve this without using Complex Methods (I haven't learnt them yet) unless absolutely necessary? Any help on this Integral would be greatly appreciated. Many, many thanks in advance! EDIT: From the comments given below byDavid H Sir, and Alex S Sir, the Integral becomes: $$\int_0^1 \dfrac{\ln^2(1+x)\ln(x)}{x}dx$$ Just an observation: This is strikingly similar to the Beta Function. Also, if we consider $$\int^1_0 (1+x)^ax^bdx$$ and differentiate twice with respect to $a$ and once with respect to $b$ and set $a=b=0$, we get the above Integral (except the $x$ in the denominator). I'm not sure, but I think taking series representations of the Integrals would be of help, especially since the closed form includes the Riemann Zeta and the Polylogarithm functions.","['calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'definite-integrals', 'integration', 'polylogarithm']"
1341312,What is the minimum degree of a polynomial for it to satisfy the following conditions?,"This is the first part of a problem in the high-school exit exam of this year, in Italy. The differentiable function $y=f(x)$ has, for $x\in[-3,3]$, the graph $\Gamma$ below: $\Gamma$ exhibits horizontal tangents at $x=-1,1,2$. The areas of the regions $A,B,C$ and $D$ are respectively $2,3,3$ and $1$. (Also, note that we are supposed to deduce $f(-2)=f(0)=f(2)=0$ from the graph) If $f(x)$ is a polynomial, what is its minimum degree? Let me explain the issue with this. In fact, the question in bold is a reformulation of mine, while the original was In case $f(x)$ were expressible with a polynomial, what could be its minimum degree? The use of ""could"" has been criticized because in fact it does not exclude incorrect answers such as $0$. Then again, it is argued that such a lexical choice was due to the high difficulty (for a high-school student) of an answer to the more precise question ""what is its minimum degree?"", therefore ""necessary, not sufficient, accessible and not trivial conditions have been provided."" (there are several articles on the subject, in Italian)
Nonetheless, there is an answer generally regarded as correct: $4$. Most students came up with that, and important websites provided it as well. Their reasoning is simple: since $f'(x)$ has $3$ zeros, its degree is at least $3$, and thus $f(x)$ is at least a quartic.
However, it is also relatively simple, solving a system with enough of the information we are given, that the assumption $f(x)=a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ yields null coefficients. I personally didn't go further, but according to some articles I would have stopped at degree $9$, thus the answer to the question in bold; though this polynomial ""in any case doesn't abide by $\Gamma$"". Here's my objection. It is clearly specified that $\Gamma$ is the plot of $f(x)$ in the considered interval, hence the minimum degree cannot be that of a polynomial which does not abide by it. The polynomial $P(x)$ must satisfy \begin{cases}
\int_{-3}^{-2}P(x)\,dx+2=\int_{-2}^0 P(x)\,dx-3=\int_0^2 P(x) \, dx + 3 = \int_2^3 P(x)\,dx+1=0 \\[6pt]
P(-2)=P(0)=P(2)=0 \\[6pt]
P'(-1)=P'(1)=P'(2)=0\\[6pt]
P''(x)=0 \ \text{twice in $[-3,3]$, at the same points where $\Gamma$ changes concavity}
\end{cases} Of course not knowing the exact coordinates of the inflection points is problematic, but in such an exam a strong resemblance would be enough. With these constraints, is there really no hope?","['polynomials', 'real-analysis', 'definite-integrals', 'derivatives']"

1341342,Cantor-Bernstein Proof,"Currently, I am studying Set Theory, and have come to the point of proving the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem (if $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B| \leq |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$).  Now, I am studying from Jech and Hrbacek's ""Introduction to Set Theory,"" but my professor provided me with a proof of the theorem that is significantly different from the book.  I worked through it, and I think I get the gist of it, but things start unravelling at the end and I need help understanding it.  So, Statement:  If $\phi:A\rightarrow B$ and $\psi:B\rightarrow A$ are one-to-one functions, then $A$ is equipotent to $B$. Proof: For $a,a'\in A$, set $a\equiv a' \iff \exists\ k\in\mathbb{N}\ s.t. (\phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1})^k(a)=a'$.
Then clearly $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation (I have a hard time proving this, but this is beyond the point I suppose). Consider the set of equivalence classes $H$ of $\equiv$.  Then, any $E\in H$ is one of two types: i) $\forall\ a\in E, \exists\ a'\ s.t.\ a' = \phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1}(a)$ ii) $\exists\ \dot a\in E \ s.t.\ \dot a \notin\ any\ (\psi\circ\phi)$ In this case, $\dot a$ is at the top of the class (in the obvious order).  Such an $\dot a$ is of two types: 1) $\psi^{-1}(\dot a)$ exists but $\phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1}(\dot a)$ doesn't. 2) $\psi^{-1}(\dot a)$ doesn't exist. We then define $\eta: A\rightarrow B$ by: $\eta(a) = \phi(a)$ if $[a]$ is of type (i) or of type (ii)-2 and $\eta(a) = \psi^{-1}(a)$ if otherwise. Claim: $\eta$ is one-to-one:  Consider $\eta(a)=\eta(a')$.  Then clearly $[a]=[a']$.  Hence, if $[a]$ is of type (ii)-1, then $\eta(a) = \psi^{-1}(a) = \psi^{-1}(a') = \eta(a')$, and since $\psi^{-1}$ is one-to-one, $a=a'$.  If $[a]$ is of type (i) or (ii)-2, then $\eta(a) = \phi(a) = \phi(a') = \eta(a')$, and since $\phi$ is one-to-one, $a=a'$. Claim: $\eta$ is onto:  Let $b\in B$ and consider $\psi(b)=a$.  If $[a]$ is of type (i) or (ii)-2, then $\phi^{-1}(b)$ exists and $\eta(\phi^{-1}(b))=b$.  If $[a]$ is of type (ii)-1, then $\eta(a)=b$. Therefore, there exists a bijection between $A$ and $B$ so that they are equipotent. QED Really, defining our $\equiv$ relation is straightforward and makes since in pictures.  But when we start getting into the different types I get a little shaky.  Type (i) is just saying that $(\phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1})$ gets mapped to something for any $a$ within the equivalence class.  Is type (ii) just saying the opposite?  That is, there is some $a$ within the equivalence class that $(\phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1})$ can't be mapped from?  The changing of the wording throws me off, and I'm not sure the significance of it. Now, if (ii) is true, then it has to be one of the other two types trivially, correct?  For either (1) or (2), $(\phi^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1})(\dot a)$ can't exist simply because it fell into type (ii).  At this point, are we just saying $\phi^{-1}(\dot a$ either works or doesn't? I suppose the big problem here is that I'm not understanding things intuitively.  He drew a picture which looks like a function mapping some $a$ between $A$ and $B$ in a cascading way, but I don't know what to make of the picture other than that fact that we can keep reapplying out composite or one of our original functions to move around between the sets. If anyone can shed any light on this proof that may make it easier for me to understand, I'd appreciate it.  And I tried my best to eliminate any errors in it, but if something seems wrong, there's a good chance it is, so let me know.",['elementary-set-theory']

However, there is something strange about the weighing device.  If you put coins $x_1, x_2, ..., x_j$ on the device the first time, then you have to put coins $(x_1+1) \bmod 50, (x_2+1) \bmod 50, ..., (x_j+1) \bmod 50$ on the scale the next time, and coins  $(x_1+2) \bmod 50, (x_2+2) \bmod 50, ..., (x_j+2) \bmod 50$ the next time and so on.

  exactly which coins weigh 10 grams and which weigh 20? Clearly you could just put one coin on the device in the first turn and then it would take exactly $50$ weighings to solve the problem.

Expanding about $x+b$: $$f(x+b)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(\partial_x^nf)(a)}{n!}(x+b-a)^n$$ Letting $a=x$: $$f(x+b)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(\partial_x^nf)(x)}{n!}b^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{((b\partial_x)^nf)(x)}{n!}$$ By definition $$e^{b\partial_x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(b\partial_x)^n}{n!}$$ Hence $$f(x+b)=(e^{b\partial_x}f)(x)$$ Hence $e^{\partial_x}=T$ where $T$ is the translation operator and $(Tf)(x)=f(x+1)$. A scaling operator We can also find a closed form for a scaling operator $S$ where $(Sf)(x)=f(ax)$. $$f(xa)=f(e^{\log{xa}})=f(e^{\log x+\log a})=f(e^{y+\log a})$$ where $y=\log x$. Letting $g(z)=f(e^z)$: $$f(xa)=g(y+\log a)$$ By our first theorem, $g(y+b)=(e^{b\partial_y}g)(y)$. Letting $b=\log a$: $$f(xa)=(e^{(\log a)\partial_y}g)(y)=(a^{\partial_y}g)(y)=(a^{\partial_{\log x}}f)(e^y)$$ Since $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \log x}=\frac{\partial x}{\partial \log x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$$ Then $$f(xa)=(a^{x\partial_x}f)(e^{\log x})=(a^{x\partial_x}f)(x)$$ Therefore $S=a^{x\partial_x}$ defines our scaling operator. A general operator Suppose we want an operator $G$ such that $(Gf)(x)=f(g(x))$. Consider: $$(e^{\partial_{h(x)}}f)(x)=(e^{\partial_y}f)(x)=(e^{\partial_y}f)(h^{-1}(h(x)))=(e^{\partial_y}f)(h^{-1}(y))$$ where $y=h(x)$. Letting $j=f\circ h^{-1}$ yields: $$(e^{\partial_{h(x)}}f)(x)=(e^{\partial_y}j)(y)=j(y+1)=f(h^{-1}(y+1))=f(h^{-1}(h(x)+1))$$ Hence solving the functional equation $$h^{-1}(h(x)+1)=g(x)$$ for $h(x)$ allows us to define our general operator $G=e^{\partial_{h(x)}}$. For example, letting $g(x)=xa$, the function $h(x)=\frac{\log x}{\log a}$ is a solution: $$h^{-1}(y)=a^y$$
$$h^{-1}(h(x)+1)=a^{h(x)+1}=a^{\frac{\log x}{\log a}+1}=a^{\frac{\log x}{\log a}}a=e^{\log x}a=xa$$ Hence the corresponding operator takes the form $$e^{\partial_{h(x)}}=e^{\partial_{\frac{\log x}{\log a}}}=e^{\log a\partial_{\log x}}=a^{x\partial_x}$$ This is the scaling operator we derived before. The case $e^{\partial_{h(x)}}=e^{x^n\partial_x}$ or equivalently $h(x)=\frac{x^{1-n}}{1-n}$ corresponds to the basis for the Witt algebra . The question My question is as follows: Can a similar procedure be used to find $e^{{\partial_x}^2}$, or $e^{{\partial_{h(x)}}^n}$ in general?

This is my answer-  I would like to know how to formalize it better. A transformation is defined in a unique way on the basis elements. Let $B_1=\{\bar v_1, \bar v_2,\bar v_3\}$ be a basis of $\Bbb R ^3$ and $B_2=\{\bar u_1, \bar u_2\}$ be a basis of $\Bbb R ^2$. Any element in the codomain of the transformation is a linear combination of $\bar u_1, \bar u_2$. The number of different linear combinations of two elements is $\aleph^2$,
 so in the construction of a linear transformation $T:\Bbb R^3 \rightarrow \Bbb R^2$ , every $v_i \space (i=1,2,3)$ can be matched with $\aleph^2$ different elements of $\Bbb R^2$. Since there are 3 elements in $B_1$, there are $(\aleph^2)^3=\aleph^6=\aleph$ possible ways to construct $T$. Therefore, the cardinality of all linear transformations  from $\Bbb R^3$ to $\Bbb R^2$ is $\aleph$. What do you think? Is the reasoning right?

1341568,Understanding an example of a prime-like non-finite additive basis,"In this answer on MO, the user Gene S. Kopp gives an example of a relatively ""big"" set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with relatively ""small"" gaps that fails to be an asymptotic finite basis. I'm having a problem in trying to understand one of the steps. Firstly, let $A_n$ for $n\geqslant 1$ and $A$ be as in the link. Given that $|A_n| = \frac{2^{2^n}- 2\cdot2^{2^{n-1}}}{2^n} > \frac{2^{2^n}-2^{2^{n-1}}}{2^{n-1}}$, we will have, in fact, that: $$A(x) \geqslant \sum_{k\leqslant \log_2\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}} |A_k| > \sum_{k\leqslant \log_2\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}} \frac{2^{2^k}- 2^{2^{k-1}}}{2^{k-1}} \geqslant \frac{\lfloor x\rfloor-2}{\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}}\gg \frac{x}{\log{x}}.$$ I'll skip show that the gaps are in fact $\ll \sqrt{x}~$ and that it contains infinitely many non-multiples of $m$ for every $m>1$ (I haven't tried to do this, but I think it's reasonable...). Now the claim is: Claim [G.S. Kopp]. $2^{2^n}$ cannot be written as a sum of fewer than $n−\log_2{n}$ elements of $A$. So, to prove this, we suppose the converse: take $a_1,\ldots,a_k \in A$ with $a_1\leqslant\cdots\leqslant a_k$ such that $2^{2^n} = a_1+\ldots +a_k$ and suppose $k< n-\log_2{n}$. Now clearly $a_k\in A_n$, otherwise we would have $a_1+\ldots +a_k < k\cdot 2^{2^{n-1}} < 2^{2^n}$. From $a_k \leqslant 2^{2^n}-2^{2^{n-1}}-2^n+1$ follows $2^{2^n}-a_k \geqslant 2^{2^{n-1}}+2^n-1>2^{2^{n-1}}$, and one may deduce by a similar argument that $a_{k-1}\in A_n\cup A_{n-1}$. However, I wasn't able to show in the same way that $a_{k-2}\in A_n\cup A_{n-1}\cup A_{n-2}$, and I have no clue how to do this is general. So, my actual question is: My actual question: How do I prove that $\displaystyle a_j \in \bigcup_{i=n-k+j}^n A_i$ ?

is analytic, 1-1, and satisfies $f(X)=X.$ Show that $f$ is a Möbius transformation. Attempt(s) : (1) I was thinking this could be done by contradiction. Here is a vague sketch of what I had in mind. Assume it's not a Möbius transformation. Viewing $f$ as a map on the Riemann sphere/extended complex plane minus these two disks, either $\infty\rightarrow \infty$ or some point on the boundary of one of the two disks is mapped to $\infty$. (If both ""large complex numbers"" and points near the boundary headed to $\infty$ we would not have injectivity. If neither, then we wouldn't have surjectivity.) If all points on the boundary of the disks do not go to $\infty$, then we can extend $f$ into the disks... (I get lost here) then somehow need to show that this maps $D_{-2}$ to $D_2$ and $D_2$ into $D_{-2}$, or fixes them both. What I would like to end up with is some automorphism of the Riemann sphere which must be a Möbius transformation.

However, unlike contour integration , this method doesn't really seem to have a users manual on how and when to use the method. In addition I rarely see the trick used on this site, and even when I do, it's usually in conjunction with contour integration or some other trick, so it makes it hard to see exactly what property is being exploited. Are there certain classes of integrals where using this method makes sense? In general, when is it best to use Feynman's trick? Here are my own thoughts. $e^{p \cdot x}$ is an important kernel used in the Laplace transform. In addition, it's derivative with respect to $p$ adds an $x$ term to the integral increasing the likelihood that a trick like integration by parts would work. Thus, functions with Laplace transforms might be solvable using Feynman Integration.","['soft-question', 'integration']"

I know two 'application' of the definition of limit point: in the standard topology, the way to recognize whether a point as a limit point is to have an arbitrary $(a,b)$ including the limit point to know if the $(a,b)$ intersects other points of the set also; in case of $A={\{a,b,...}\}$, although ${\{a,b}\}$ is a neighborhood of $a$, but ${\{a}\}$ is itself also is a neighborhood of $a$. Having said that, since ${\{a}\}$ doesn't include other points in addition to $a$, so no element/point of $A={\{a,b,...}\}$ is limit point since not every neighborhood intersects $A$ in another point. So is for the case of $\Bbb Z_+\times Y$. Since $(n,b)\in S$ is also a neighborhood of $(n,b)$, why then $(n,a)$ is a limit point of $S$?

Is such a  group always isomorphic to a subgroup of $GL_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z})$? A simpler problem would be to show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $GL_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$. This seems to follow from that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup $H$ of $S_{n}$ and each element of $h$ is associated to a permutation matrix $h' \in GL_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$.  We can consider that the subgroup $H$ which $G$ is isomorphic to is the set of maps $f_{g}: G \rightarrow G$ that multiply on the left by $g$. We then have that every element of $H$ fixes the identity element of $G$ and hence can be viewed as a permutation of $n-1$ elements.

1341714,how to sum the floors of ratios n/k when prime factorization of n is known,"According to @harald-hanche-olsen the sum of the floors of ratios of $n/k$ is approximately: $$n(\ln n-1-\ln2)<\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac nk\Bigr\rfloor<n\ln n.$$ If the prime factorization of $n$ is known (that is, if $n=\Pi_i{k_i^{\alpha_i}}$), can a closer approximation be obtained? In my case the exact value of $n$ is not important, just the accuracy of the sum of the floors of the ratios.  One approach is to let $n=\Pi^p_i{i}$ so the the first $p$ sums would be exact (equal to $nH_p$ where $H_p$ is the $p^{th}$ harmonic number) and the approximation is needed only for: $$
\sum_{k=p+1}^{n-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac{\Pi^p_i{i}}k\Bigr\rfloor
$$ The reduction in the range is marginal using this approach:  it can be expressed as:
$$nH_p+n(\ln n-1-\ln2)-p(\ln p-1-\ln2)\le\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac nk\Bigr\rfloor\le nH_p+n\ln n-p\ln p.$$ Other optimizations may be possible. For example: If $n=p^{2^k}$ then $n\Pi_{i=0}^k(1+p^{-2^i})$ sums for all combinations of factors from $p^0$ to $p^{2^k}$ If $n=4!=24$ then $$\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac nk\Bigr\rfloor=12+8+6+\Bigl\lfloor \frac {24}5\Bigr\rfloor+4*(6-5)+3*(8-6)+2*(12-8)+1*(24-12)$$ So the biggest region of uncertainty for a factorial $f!$ lies between $f<k<(f-1)!$.  Furthermore we have $$((f-1)!-1)((f-1)!-f-1) < \sum_{k=f+1}^{(f-1)!-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac nk\Bigr\rfloor < f((f-1)!-f-1)$$ Edit The answer should be in the form of: Given: $$

a_u <= \sum_{k}^{u-1}\Bigl\lfloor \frac{u}k\Bigr\rfloor <= a_u+\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{u})

1341815,Nonexistence of local isometry between equidimensional Riemannian manifolds,"Recall that all inner product spaces of the same dimension are isometric. For example, if $(M,\mathrm{g})$ and $(N,\mathrm{h})$ are Riemannian manifolds of the same dimension, then $(T_pM,\mathrm{g}_p)$ and $(T_qN,\mathrm{h}_q)$ are isometric inner product spaces. Let $\beta:T_pM\to T_qN$ be a (linear) isometry. Question : Why isn't $\exp_q\!\circ\,\beta\circ\exp_p^{-1}$ a local isometry wherever it is defined? To clarify, I know that it isn't a local isometry, at least in general. If it was, then I'd have a local isometry between neighborhoods of every point on each equidimensional Riemannian manifold, which is clearly absurd. I'm looking for an explanation as to why this composition is not a local isometry. I'm not looking for a counterexample. I think my mental impasse comes from Gauss' lemma, but I'm not sure. Using the chain rule, shouldn't $\exp_{q*}\!\circ\,\beta\circ\exp_{p*}^{-1}$, as a composition of linear isometries, itself be a linear isometry?","['isometry', 'differential-geometry', 'inner-products', 'riemannian-geometry']"
1341836,"Unsolvability of a Quintic and its link with ""Simplicity"" of $A_{5}$","At the outset I must mention that I don't have a fairly working knowledge of Galois Theory (but do have some idea of group theory in the sense that I can understand normal subgroups). I read the proof of unsolvability of a general quintic via radicals from  J P Tignol's ""Galois Theory of Algebraic Equations"". Here he discusses the proof by Abel and goes on to establish the following theorem (see details in my blog post ): Theorem : Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{n}$ be indeterminates and let  elements $a, b$ be in field $K = \mathbb{C}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})$ such that $a = b^{p}$ for some prime number $p$. Let $n \geq 5$ and define permutations $\sigma, \tau$ such that $\sigma$ permutes $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ cyclically and $\tau$ permutes $x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}$ cyclically. If $a$ in invariant under both $\sigma, \tau$ then so is $b$. Because of the equation $a = b^{p}$ the above theorem implies that when $n \geq 5$ there are some symmetries (invariance under $\sigma, \tau$) which remain even after taking radicals. Thus starting with the elementary symmetric function $s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}$ of the indeterminates $x_{i}$ the process of taking radicals will preserve the symmetries related to $\sigma, \tau$. On the other hand each one of the indeterminates $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}$ is changed via at least one of $\sigma$ and $\tau$. Thus the field $K$ has elements which are changed by $\sigma, \tau$ but any element of a radical extension of $F = \mathbb{C}(s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n})$ is invariant under $\sigma, \tau$ and hence it is not possible to get to $K$ from $F$ via radical extensions. On the other hand most modern treatments of unsolvability of quintic base it on the simplicity of alternating group $A_{5}$. Understanding the above mentioned theorem in Tignol's book is quite easy (simple algebraic manipulation) but its not same as regards to simplicity of $A_{5}$. Is simplicity of $A_{5}$ somehow linked with the above basic theorem? What I need is a proper link between properties of $A_{5}$ and the above theorem. What is so special about elements $\sigma = (1,2,3), \tau = (3,4,5)$ of $A_{5}$? And why don't we have such permutations when $n < 5$ whose symmetries are preserved when taking radicals. Update : I think I need to clarify my point very clearly. The message of the theorem described above is that for $n \geq 5$ there exists a set $P$ of permutations on $n$ symbols such that $P$ includes at least one non-identity permutation and the process of root extraction preserves the symmetries induced by the permutations of $P$. For $n < 5$ root extraction preserves the symmetries induced only by the identity permutation (trivially). My real problem is that I am unable to map this simple concept with the comparatively difficult concept of unsolvability / simplicity of $A_{5}$. There is a feeling that probably the solvability of polynomials is a much simpler concept than the solvability of groups (as least as far the general polynomials with indeterminate coefficients are concerned). At the same time this feeling is crushed by the theorem of Galois that ""a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its galois group is solvable"" so that these concepts are at the same level of depth/difficulty. If it helps, I checked Tignol's book and he mentions that the theorem mentioned above is by Paolo Ruffini and he gives the reference: P. Ruffini, Opere Matematiche (3 vols), E. Bortolotti, ed., Ed. Cremonese 
della Casa Editrice Perrella, Roma, 1953-1954. The result is available in pages 162-170 in vol 2. Further Update : I am not getting the kind of answer I need. Perhaps I need to provide a context in the language of Galois Theory. Let's assume fields to be of characteristic $0$ in what follows. Let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial and $K$ be splitting field of $f$. Galois theory says that the galois group of $f$ (over field $F$) is the set of automorphisms of $K$ which leave $F$ fixed. Also if $L$ is another field with $F \subseteq L \subseteq K$ then galois group of $f$ over $L$ is a subgroup of its galois group over $F$. Also note that the galois group can be viewed as a subgroup of the group of permutations of roots of polynomial $f(x)$. It is further known that when the field $L$ is obtained by adjoining all roots of an irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ (of degree $k$) so that $L = F(\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{k})$ and $p(\alpha_{i}) = 0$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$ then the galois group $Gal(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $Gal(K/F)$. This case is relevant when $L$ is a radical extension of $F$. In our case $F = \mathbb{C}(s_{1}, \dots, s_{n}), K = \mathbb{C}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})$ and we are directly able to find a set of permutations of $x_{i}$ which leave every element of $L$ fixed where $L$ is a radical extension of $F$. Hence if $L$ is any radical extension of $F$ with $F \subseteq L \subseteq K$ then $Gal(K/L)$ contains two permutations $\sigma, \tau$ given above. Since radical extensions correspond to a chain of reducing (getting smaller in size) normal subgroups of $S_{n}$, this shows that the series can never get to the trivial group consisting of identity. In my opinion the theorem by Paolo Ruffini provides a very direct and easily accessible proof of unsolvability of the $S_{5}, A_{5}$ and it is so unlike the usual proofs of unsolvability of $A_{5}$. Let me know if my views are correct.","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory']"
1341838,Convergence and divergence depending on whether $n$ is odd or even,"It is part of one problem I am working on: I want to prove the following conjecture ($x\ne q\pi$ where $q\in\Bbb Q$) $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^{2k-1}(nx)}{n^{\alpha}}\quad\text{converges if}\quad0<\alpha\le1,k\in\Bbb N$$
  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^{2k}(nx)}{n^{\alpha}}\quad\text{diverges if}\quad0<\alpha\le1,k\in\Bbb N$$ So far I have tested cases for $\sin^{1,2,3,4}$ and the results agree with the conjecture. I believe it holds for all natural numbers. I tried using induction but I failed. Could you help me or improve my method? Best regards. My failed induction method, for the $\sin^{2k}$ cases, was as follows: Hypothesis $$\sin^{2k}\theta=\xi_k+T_k(\theta)$$
  where $\xi_k\in\Bbb R^+$ (the positivity of $\xi$ is needed in the context of the bigger problem, though it is not necessary in the conjecture), $T_k(\theta)$ is a linear combination of ""first-order"" trignometric terms: $\sin\theta,\sin 2\theta,\sin 3\theta,\cdots$ or $\cos\theta,\cos2\theta,\cos3\theta\cdots$ but not $\sin^2\theta,\sin^3 2\theta,\cos^45\theta$ etc. If this hypothesis holds, then by Abel-Dirichlet criterion it is easy to prove the second part of the conjecture. Proof by induction Initial case $k=1$ is trivial. If for any given $k$ the hypothesis stands, then for $(k+1)$ $$
\begin{align*}
\sin^{2k+2}\theta=&\xi_k\sin^2\theta+\sin^2\theta T_k(\theta)\\
=&\xi_k\left(\frac{1-\cos 2\theta}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{1-\cos 2\theta}{2}\right)T_k(\theta) \\
=&\frac12\xi_k-\frac12\xi_k\cos2\theta+\frac12T_k(\theta)-\frac12\cos(2\theta)T_k(\theta)
\end{align*}
$$
  Now the hard part lies in the last term of RHS: it definitely contains terms like $\cos2\theta\sin m\theta$ or $\cos2\theta\cos m\theta$, to reduce them to the ""first order"", it must yield some constant terms, which might threaten the existence of a positive $\xi_{k+1}$. I don't know how to proceed.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'induction', 'trigonometry']"

So far I've tried using Mean Value Theorem on $\ [b,b+1],$ so that $\ b>x_0$. From there I assumed in order to contradict, that $\ f(x)$ converges to a finite $\ L$. So 
$$ \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=  \lim_{x\to\infty} f(b+1)-f(b)= L -L=0$$
This is against that (*)$\ f'(x) > 0$ so $\ f(x)$ does not converge to a finite value. Finally $\ f(x)$ is strictly increasing ($\ f'(x)\ge a>0$) so it tends to infinity.

I think that * might be faulty, if the limit of a derivative is zero it doesn't mean that the actual derivative is affected so. Maybe there is a different direction to approach this. Any input? Maybe this should be solved in a different way?","['calculus', 'limits', 'derivatives']"
