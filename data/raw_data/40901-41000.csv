403062,Notation for the pushforward measure,"Given a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$, a measurable space $(Y,\Xi)$ and a measurable map $f\in\Sigma/\Xi$, the pushforward measure $\nu:=\mu\circ f^{-1}$ is given by
$$
  \nu[A] = \mu[f^{-1}(A)]
$$
for any $A\in \Xi$. That is, $f$ pushes $\mu$ from $(X,\Sigma)$ to $(Y,\Xi)$. The notation $\mu\circ f^{-1}$ is often used in probability theory, but it is not really convenient. I saw also a notation with an asterisk such as $\nu = f^*\mu$ here and $\nu = f_*\mu$ here and here . Since I have no much experience with pushforwards and pullbacks in other fields, I am not sure which of the notations is the right one: with an asterisk on the top or bottom. I would be happy if somebody clarifies this. P.S. If one considers the category of measurable maps and stochastic (conditional) kernels as arrows, $f$ and $\mu$ are both special cases of arrows so actually in that notation it appears that
$$
  \nu = f\circ \mu
$$
which is very confusing taking into account the probabilistic variant $\nu = \mu\circ f^{-1}$. I've found another notation $f_\#\mu$ here .","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'notation']"
403076,Kernel of a morphism between coherent sheaves.,"Throughout this book, http://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Algebraic_Geometry_and_Arithmetic_Curves.html?id=uaLKdA0PxS4C&redir_esc=y , kernel of a morphism between coherent sheaves on a locally Noetherian scheme is also coherent. More precisely, let $X$ be a locally Noetherian scheme and  $u:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of coherent sheaves on $X$. Then $\textrm{Ker }u$ is also coherent. The author says, this is trivially true. However, I cannot prove it. Moreover, I do not know whether it is really true or not. Even though I do not have any explicit example, I think this would be false in following sense; when $X$ is locally Noetherian scheme and $\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$, it is known that $\mathcal{F}(U)$ is finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$-module for any affine open subset $U$ of $X$. If $\textrm{Ker }u$ is coherent, then the sequence $\textrm{Ker }u(U)\to\mathcal{F}(U)\to\mathcal{G}(U)$ of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$-modules is an exact for any affine open $U$. However, in general, a submodule of a finitely generated module is not finitely generated. So, maybe there would be an example that arises form the sequence $\textrm{ker} f \to L\xrightarrow{f}M$ where $L,M$ are finitely generated modules and $\textrm{ker }f$ cannot be generated by any finite set. Is this reasonable? Actually, we can find the same statement for $X$ is Noetherian case in Hartshorne's book. If the above statement is true, how can we expand the case?","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"
403083,Is martingale problem interesting?,"Why is the Martingale problem interesting, or useful to areas outside of math like economics, game theory, physics, etc.?

403084,Complex differentiable but not analytic on circle of convergence,"I'm trying to get a better handle on behavior of complex power series on the boundary of their maximal disk of convergence. I'm reading Bak-Newman's Complex Analysis , Chapter 18.1. A regular point $z_0$ on the circle bounding the maximal disk of convergence is defined as one where the function in question can be continued analytically to some open neighborhood of $z_0$. My understanding of analytic at a point in this book is that it is always used to indicate differentiability on some neighborhood of the point , so that being analytic at a point is equivalent to being analytic in some open disk around a point. (By differentiable at a point $z_0$ I mean that $\lim_{z \to z_0}\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z - z_0}$ exists, or that equivalently the function $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is differentiable and the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold.) This section of the book also defines a singularity on the circle of convergence to be a point which is not a regular point. I'm trying to figure out how this definition of singularity relates to the notion of isolated singularity with which I'm already (more or less) comfortable. My question is this: Is it possible to be differentiable at a point on the circle of convergence, but not analytic at that point? More or less, I'm trying to figure out if there is a function which is defined in some open neighborhood of the closed unit disk, analytic in the open unit disk, complex differentiable at $z = 1$, but not differentiable at each of a sequence of real $x_n > 1$ which converge to $1$.

403099,Definition of a primitive polynomial,"I understand there are already some questions ( A , B ) on primitive polynomials.  But none of these clears my confusion. In page 84 of Handbook of Applied Cryptography , primitive polynomial has been defined as, Now, if I try to understand the definition by dissecting the parts, This is an irreducible polynomial, that means, it cannot be factored into the product of two or more non-trivial polynomials. The polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$. So, the polynomial belongs to the  polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_p [x]$, where, $\mathbb{Z}_p [x]$  is the ring formed by the set of all polynomials in the indeterminate $x$ having coefficients from $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Here $\mathbb{Z}_p$, will be the integers modulo $p$,  set of (equivalence classes of) integers
$\{0, 1, 2, . . . , p − 1\}$. $x$ is a generator of $\mathbb{F}^*_{p^m}$: I am coming to this part regarding $x$ later on. $\mathbb{F}^*_{p^m}$,  is the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ such that $ \{a \in \mathbb{F}_{p^m} | \gcd(a, p) = 1\}$. $\mathbb{F}_{p^m} = \mathbb{Z}_p[x]/(f(x))$, denotes the set of (equivalence classes of) polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$
of degree less than $n = \deg f (x)$. Addition and multiplication are performed modulo $f (x)$. Now, coming back to the point of $x$, I began to realize that I must have some 
serious flaw in my understanding above. So far, I have seen that generators have always been numbers. 
Here the generator is $x$, which is an indeterminate. Could you please point out the where I have gone off the track? Perhaps the best way to salvage me will be to simply rewrite my points 1-4. Adding an example will make things perfect.","['finite-fields', 'discrete-mathematics', 'polynomials']"

The mapping $\pi$ is clearly a surjective homomorphism with kernel $Z$ , and part (a) follows from the isomorphism theorem. For part (b), I must prove that $G/Z$ cannot be a nontrivial cyclic group. If it were, the group would equal $\{Z,Zg,Zg^2,\ldots,Zg^{n-1}\}$ for some $g\in G$ . Also, $G/Z$ would be an abelian group, and it follows that the commutator subgroup $G'$ belongs to $Z$ .

403199,Is the following polynomial reducible over Q?,"I am looking at an exercise saying that ""Demonstrate that x 4 -22x 2 +1 is reducible over Q. I have the solution manual and it solves like the following: If x 4 -22x 2 +1 is reducible over Z, then it factors in Z[x], and must therefore
either have a linear factor in Z[x] or factor into two quadratics in Z[x]. The only possibilites for a
linear factor are x ± 1, and clearly neither 1 nor -1 is a zero of the polynomial, so a linear factor is
impossible. Suppose
x 4 -22x 2 +1 = (x 2 + ax + b)(x 2 + cx + d).
Equating coefficients, we see that
x 3 coefficient : 0 = a + c
x 2 coefficient : −22 = ac + b + d
x coefficient : 0 = bc + ad
constant term : 1 = bd so either b = d = 1 or b = d = −1.
Suppose b = d = 1. Then −22 = ac + 1 + 1 so ac = −24. Because a + c = 0, we have a = −c, so
−c2 = −24 which is impossible for an integer c. Similarly, if b = d = −1, we deduce that −c2 = −20,
which is also impossible. Thus the polynomial is irreducible. My question is: 1)What does it mean ""over Q""?

403318,Interesting Normality Condition (topology),"I just got through an inquiry-based course in introductory topology, and I enjoyed the experience a lot. If you're unfamiliar, this roughly means that we were given a text full of theorems and the class consisted of providing as many proofs as possible, with student presentations in lieu of lectures. There was one theorem which I got a lot of use out of, but was never able to prove. It wasn't assigned, and I talked to the professor about it a couple times, but he didn't have any advice for me that I hadn't figured out myself. The text calls it the ""Normality Lemma"" if that helps, but it doesn't appear to be a standard term. Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of a topological space $X$ and let $\{U_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ and $\{V_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ be two collections of open sets such that: $A\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} U_i$ and $B\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} V_i$ $\overline{U_i}\cap B$ and $\overline{V_i}\cap A$ are empty for all $i\in\mathbb N$. Then there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq V$. The thing that really puzzles me about this is the countability condition. Is this doing anything more than saying the collections need to be infinite? Another interesting quirk about this theorem is that it doesn't show that $X$ is normal explicitly. Rather it guarantees disjoint open sets around a specific pair of (sufficiently ''cushioned'') arbitrary sets for any space. Can anyone help me through a proof of this?",['general-topology']

For a differential equation $y'=cy,$ I get a similar characteristic equation: $r=c$, however, as I understand it, the the analogy between differential equations and recurrence relations is given by $y'\sim y_n-y_{n-1},$ not $y'\sim y_n.$ By this logic, I think the characteristic equation for the recurrence relation $y_n=cy_{n-1}$ should be $r=c-1,$ because the recurrence relation is equivalent to $y_n-y_{n-1}=(c-1)y_{n-1}.$ Could you help me understand why the analogy breaks down here (or why it doesn't)?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'recurrence-relations']"

Every continuous function on a dense subset can be continuously extend to the closure of that subspace (which is by definition of ""dense"", the whole space). The theorem from here .

403823,Product of two compact topological spaces is compact.,"Proof: I am following this . But, I feel, I am missing something.

Now, define $\pi_2:A_{(x,y)}$ which forms an open cover for $X_2$ and has finite subcover $\{A_{(x,y_i)}\}$. It's clear up to this point. Let $\{B_x\}$ be the intersection of $\{\pi_1:(A_y)\}$ within $A_{y_i}$, which is open. Thus, $\{B_x\}$ forms an open cover, which has a finite subcover, $\{B_{x_i}\}$. The corresponding sets $\{A_{x_i,y_i}\}$ is finite, and forms an open subcover of the set. First, we know the covers cover $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively. But, how do we know that they cover $X_1*X_2$?

In fact, $G$ is not finitely generated (as far as I can tell), and so do we get a sort of infinite wedge of circles? I assume we would if we looked at the quotient $\Delta(G;S)/G$ for $S$ the set of generators of $G$, but we are taking a bigger initial group so I would think that it would still be an infinite wedge of circles, but with a 'bigger' infinite number... In that case its only vertex would have infinite valence.

where $\theta_d/2 = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2d}{d+1}}$ denotes the ratio between the diameter and the radius of the smallest enclosing ball of a regular simplex. Intuitively, it seems that the way of making the smallest intersection is to assign all points $c_i$ to the vertices of a regular simplex of diameter $1$ and all $r_i$ to $1$. By doing so, one can check that the ball of radius $1-\frac{\theta_d}{2}$ centered at $x$ the barycenter of $\{c_1,\dots,c_n\}$ is included in the intersection of balls $ \bigcap_i B(c_i,r_i)$.
Indeed, in the case of a simplex, the radius of the biggest ball centered at $x$ and included in the intersection of balls is $1-\text{Radius}(\sigma) = 1 - \frac{\theta_d}{2}$ (hence the constant is tight in this case). I am having difficulties to prove that this case is indeed the worst case. 
I was just able to prove that the result holds when all balls have the same radius.
Does this result seems familiar to someone? I would really appreciate any comment, idea or reference. ps : The topology tag is here for several reason.

So f and g coincide in a small neighborhood of p. $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

$$\dot x_1=x_1$$
$$\dot x_2=2x_2+cx_1^2$$ Question: I believe this is correct, is it not?","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
404067,"Proving that brownian motion pass almost ever by zero in $]0,t[$","Consider $B=(B_0)_{t\geq 0}$ a real $\mathcal F_t$ - brownian motion starting at zero, in a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, (\mathcal F_t)_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb P)$. Then, consider

Basically, I'd like to understand where this identity comes from; $$\tan(2t) = \dfrac{2\tan(t)}{1 - \tan^2(t)}$$ Thanks for any help you can give - if it's useful to know the context of the problem, I'm writing a bit of code that converges on $\pi$ faster than Leibniz's series.

404106,The 'compactness cardinal' of a space,"I'm looking for references (and a name!) for the following invariant of a topological space $X$: The least (infinite) cardinal $\kappa$ such that any open cover of $X$ has a subcover of cardinality less than $\kappa$.

404116,Proving that $T_t := S_t -\left| x \right| -\frac {n-1}{2} \int _0 ^t \frac {1}{S_u}~du$ is a brownian motion,"Consider $B=(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$ $\mathcal F_t$ - brownian motion in $\mathbb R ^n, \  (n\geq 2)$ starting at zero, in a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, (\mathcal F_t)_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb P)$ . Then, consider $X_t ^x = x + B_t $ and $S_t = \left|X^x_t\right|$ .
I was trying to show that $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ defined by $$T_t := S_t -\left| x \right| -\frac {n-1}{2} \int _0 ^t \frac {1}{S_u}~du$$ is a real $\mathcal F_t$ - brownian motion. It's not difficult to see that $W_t = S_t -\left| x \right|$ is a real $\mathcal F_t$ - brownian motion. Inded, Ito's lemma implies that $$ W_t = \int _0 ^t \frac{X^x_t}{\left| X^x_t \right| }~ dB_s $$ wich is well defined since $\mathbb P (\exists t>0 :  S_t =\left| X^x_t \right| =0) =0$ . Then by Pauls-Lévy Theorem we have that $(W_t)$ is a real $\mathcal F_t$ - brownian motion. So, $$T_t = W_t  -\frac {n-1}{2} \int _0 ^t \frac {1}{S_u}~du.$$ Have anybody a smarter idea that compute its mean and covariance in order to apply again Paul-Lévy theorem ? If not, any smart advices to simplify the calculation? Thank's in advance. Edit: Maybe this other result could helpful to crack this proof. I could show that $\mathbb E \left\{ \int _0 ^t \frac {1}{S_u}~du\right\} =0$ since $M_t := \int _0 ^t \frac {1}{S_u}~du$ is a bounded local martingale.
Then for the covariation we have $$ \mathbb E \left \{T_s T_t  \right\}=t \wedge s -c (\mathbb E \left \{W_s M_t  \right\} +\mathbb E \left \{M_s W_t  \right\}) + \mathbb E \left \{M_s M_t  \right\}$$ New Edit: Could someone please check the question at the end of my solution try at the answer ?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-integrals']"
404123,Proof of Lusin's Theorem,"$\mathbf{Theorem}$. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable set, $\mu(A)<\infty$ and $f$ a measurable function with domain $A$. Then, for every $\varepsilon >0$ there exists a compact set $K \subset A$ with $\mu(A \smallsetminus K) <\varepsilon$, such that the restriction of $f$ to $K$ is continuous. Proof .  Let $\{V_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be an enumeration of the open intervals with rational endpoints. Fix compact sets $K_n\subset f^{-1}[V_n]$ and $K'_n\subset A \smallsetminus f^{-1}[V_n]$ for each $n$, so that 
$\mu\big(A \smallsetminus (K_n \cup K'_n)\big) < \varepsilon/2^n$. Set $$K = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \big(K_n \cup K'_n\big). $$ 
Clearly $\mu(A \smallsetminus K) < \varepsilon$. Given $x \in K$ and $n$, such that $f(x) \in V_n$, we can prove continuity of $f$ when restricted on $K$, by choosing a compact neighbourhood $\tilde{K}_n$, such that $x \in \tilde{K}_n$ and $f(\tilde{K}_n \cap K) \subset V_n$.  $\qquad\qquad\square$ $\mathbf{Q1}$: I don't see how $K = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}(K_n \cup K'_n) $ yields $\mu(A \setminus K) < \epsilon$. The way I see it, the intersection should have a really small measure. 
\begin{align}
K = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}(K_n \cup K'_n) =\Bigg( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (K_n \cup K'_n)^{c} \Bigg)^{c}\\
\mu(K) = \mu \Bigg (\Bigg( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (K_n \cup K'_n)^{c} \Bigg)^{c} \Bigg) = \mu(A) - \mu \Bigg( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (K_n \cup K'_n)^{c} \Bigg)
\end{align}
the union of $(K_n \cup K'_n)^{c}$ is probably going to cover almost the entire $A$, right? If this is the case then $\mu(K)=\mu(A)-(\mu(A)-\delta) = \delta$. Where $\delta$ is a small number. Did I make a mistake somewhere? $\mathbf{Q2}$: Do I understand it correctly that we're removing all the compacts $K'_n \subseteq A \setminus f^{-1}(V_n)$ from $A$ in order to achieve continuity? Because for $x \in K'_n$ we don't have $f(x) \in V_n$.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
404142,"$u\in W^{1,p}(B)$ implies $u\in W^{1,p}(\partial B_t)$ for almost $t\in (0,1]$?","Suppose that $u\in W^{1,p}(B)$ where $B=B(0,1)\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ and $p\geq 1$.

My question is: Is there any simple way to see that $u\in W^{1,p}(\partial B_t)$ for those balls where $u_{|\partial B_t},(\nabla u)_{\partial B_t}$ are defined and if $v\in L^p(\partial B_t)^N$ is the gradient of $u$ in the distributional sense, then $v=(\nabla u)_{|\partial B_t}$? Update: I have an idea. Let $u_n\in C^1(\overline{B})$ such that $u_n\to u$ in $W^{1,p}(B)$. Note that byt Fatou's Lemma: $$\int_0^1\liminf\int_{\partial B}(|u_n(r\omega)-u(r\omega)|^p+|\nabla u_n(r\omega)-\nabla u(r\omega)|^p)r^{N-1}drd\Gamma\leq \\ \lim\int_B(|u_n(x)-u(x)|^p+|\nabla u_n(x)-\nabla u(x)|^p)dx \to 0$$ Hence, for almost $t\in (0,1]$, there exist a subsequence of $u_n$ not relabeled such that $$\int_{\partial B_t}(|u_n(y)-u(y)|^p+|\nabla u_n(y)-\nabla u(y)|^p)d\Gamma_t\to 0$$ Can I conclude what I have estated from the last convergence?

404155,Chebyshev and Markov inequalities,"Chebyshev inequality: Let $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measurable space, $f$ a non-negative measurable function defined on $\mathcal{X}$. Then, $$\mu([f>c]) \le \frac{1}{c^p} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f^p d\mu$$ Proof: 
$$\int_{\mathcal{X}} f^p d\mu  \ge \int_{[f>c]} f^p d\mu \ge \int_{[f>c]} c^p d\mu =c^p \mu([f>c])$$ Of course we can have the Chebyshev inequality in a probabilistic setting. Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A},\mathbb{P})$ be the stochastic basis, $X$ a non-negative  random variable. Then: $$ \mathbb{P}[X>t] \le \frac{1}{t^p} \mathbb{E}[X^p]$$
Markov inequality: $$ \mathbb{P}[X>t] \le \frac{1}{t} \mathbb{E}[X]$$ So it would seem that the Markov inequality is a special case of Chebyshev ($p=1)$. Is that correct?","['measure-theory', 'inequality', 'probability']"
