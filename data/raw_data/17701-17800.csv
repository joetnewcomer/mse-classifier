145871,Is the Lebesgue integral the completion of integrals on step functions?,"Lierre gave a very helpful insight at answer 5 on A ""clean"" approach to integrals. about what Riemann integrals are. My question relates to whether this can be extended to Lebesgue integrals. Lierre pointed out that Riemman integrals can be seen as the natural extension of the 'obvious' linear form on characteristic (or 'indicatrix') functions on real line intervals. 
There is a theorem which shows that any uniformly continuous function $f$ on a subset $V$ of a metric space $X$ into a complete metric space $Y$ can be uniquely extended to a u.c. function on the closure of $V$ into $Y$. 
If we take $X$ and $Y$ as $\mathbb{R}$, and $V$ as being the subspace of real functions on $\mathbb{R}$ spanned by the characteristic functions of closed finite intervals $[a,b]$, and $f$ as the function taking $[a,b]$ to $|a-b|$, it turns out that the Riemann integral is the extension of $f$ to closure of $V$. My question is this: if we take countable unions of intervals $[a,b]$, with the 'obvious' $f$ defined as a countable sum (if it exists), and the subspace of functions on $\mathbb{R}$ spanned by these as our $V$, is it also true that the closure of $V$ consists of the Lebesgue integrable functions, and that $f$ extends to the Lebesgue integral on them?
Also, how far if at all can one go in proving theorems such as the dominated convergence theorem based purely on the properties f must have as an extension to the closure, without actually constructing the integral itself? Thanks!",['integration']
145873,"How to find a finite set of generators for $I \subset k[x_1, ..., x_n]$","Suppose that we have a set of polynomials $f_1, ..., f_m \in C = k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ where $k$ is an algebraically closed field, and let $V$ denote the set on which they all simultaneously vanish. Define $I(V)$ to be the ideal of polynomials in $C$ which vanish on all of $V$. In general, $I(V) = \text{rad}(f_1, ..., f_m)$ by Hilbert's nullstellensatz, and it is finitely generated by the Hilbert's basis theorem, but I was wondering is there a good way to find a set of generators for $I(V)$? Essentially I am asking, is there a good way to find the generators of the radical of an ideal, given that ideal's generators? I am interested in this problem, because I am interested in solving systems of polynomial equations in several variables. I was thinking I could use Grobner bases to reduce a system of equations to a simpler system involving less variables, but as far as I'm aware in order to computer a Grobner basis one needs a generating set already. It could be that I am lucky and $I(V) = (f_1, ..., f_m)$, but that seems quite rare to me!","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

me some more intuition about the Jacobian. If I try to simply write the differentials: \begin{align}

dy & = dr \sin \theta + r \cos \theta\ d\theta\\

145957,On Constructions by Marked Straightedge and Compass,"Pierpont proved that a regular $n$-gon is constructible by (singly) marked straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} + 1 > 3$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. It has been known since the time of Archimedes that a marked straightedge allows for angle trisection . Let a $q$-sector be an object which allows for angle $q$-section. Does this result generalize to the following? Let $q$ be a prime. A regular $n$-gon is constructible by $q$-sector, straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \cdots q^{a_m}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} \cdots q^{b_m} + 1 > q$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. Update : Gleason 's paper provides the complete answer for constructible $n$-gons. Here, it is shown that a regular $n$-gon is constructible by straightedge, compass and $p$-sector for each prime $p$ dividing $\varphi(n)$, the Euler totient of $n$. Thus, I must modify my conjecture to the following: Let $q$ be a prime. A regular $n$-gon is constructible by $\{ 3, 5, \dots, q \}$-sectors, straightedge and compass if and only if $n = k \, p_1 \cdots p_{s}$, where $k = 2^{a_1} 3^{a_2} \cdots q^{a_m}$ for $a_i \geq 0$ and $p_i = 2^{b_1} 3^{b_2} \cdots q^{b_m} + 1 > q$ is prime with $b_i \geq 0$. One direction is certainly true by using the multiplicativity of the Euler totient function. The question is now whether the other direction also holds.","['geometry', 'geometric-construction', 'abstract-algebra']"

   1/3  if 1 <= x <2

   1    if x >= 2 As for my notation above, I'm unfamiliar with LaTex, but what I'm trying to show you is a piecewise function. Here <= means ""less than or equal to"". Now the question asks to find the value of c, given the expected value is 1. Here is what I have done: First, find the values of the probabilities at 0,1 and 2 Using limits, we find P(X=0) is 1/4.
Similiarly, we find P(X=1) is 1/12 -c (here I subtracted c+1/4 from 1/3, using the idea of limits again) Finally, we find P(X=2) is 1- 1/3 = 2/3. Now, use these values to calculate the expected value: Here is where the confusion arises. First, I split the E[X] into three components: 1) the definite integral of d/dx [(cx + 1/4)times x] between 0 and 1 2) 1/12 - c times 1 3) 2 times 2/3 Now, I add these all up and equate: c/2 +4/3 +1/12 -c = 1, hence solving c = 5/6, however this leads to a negative probability for P(X=1), as 1/12 - 5/6 is less than zero. Where have I gone wrong in my above calculations? I think it's to do with my expected value calculation.",['statistics']

You can choose an open set $V$ containing $x$ and such that $V\cap \left(S\setminus\{x\}\right)=\emptyset$ (because $x\notin S'$).

146131,Algebraic Solution to $\cos(\pi x) + x^2 = 0$,"Today I was fiddling about with a TI-89 calculator, attempting as usual to confuse it. I figured that making it solve an equation with a periodic function would be fun, so I tried the following: $$\cos(\pi x) + x^2 = 0$$ While this didn't stump it, I noted that the solution it gave was just a decimal. Since I ran this through solve(), which usually will give you a nice solution like $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ if it can, I found this rather interesting. I figured what it eventually did was give up on solving it in its usual manner and move to a numeric method: i.e., it simply made intelligent guesses until it found good solutions. I am usually inclined to think most random decimals have a closed form expression behind them. (In fact, do all such decimals have a closed form, even if we don't know it? I may have to look into that.) As such, I decided to put this into Wolfram|Alpha and see if it had any better results . But no dice; it gave me back, similar to the TI-89, that $x = \pm 1$ and $x \approx \pm 0.629847$ were solutions. The latter decimal, $x \approx 0.629847$, is the one I am concerned with. As far as I am concerned, $x = \pm 1$ are sort of ""trivial"" solutions; just thinking the problem over leads you to them naturally. Is there a way to solve this algebraically? I can sort of narrow it down. I know that as $x \to \infty$, the $\cos(\pi x)$ term is essentially trivial compared to $x^2$. Given that $x^2>0$ for any $x \ne 0$, and given that $\cos(\pi x)$ has a range of $[-1, 1]$, it seems to me that whenever $x^2>1$, $\cos(\pi x)$ cannot pull down $x^2$ enough for it become zero. So, it seems natural to me to think, then, that all solutions must lie where $x^2 \le 1$, viz., within the interval $[-1, 1]$. This narrows down the field significantly, but it still does not really help me with an algebraic solution. (However, I figure if I were to come across this in a real-world scenario, this would be a useful line of attack for a guess-and-test sort of deal.) Another line of attack I attempted was to take the reverse approach: use the numerically attained solution to find a closed-form solution. I thought it may be an interesting number I simply had not learned about, so I tried to look up the decimal sequence in the OEIS, but to no luck: no such sequence was available. I've sort of rambled, so here are my questions: Is there an algebraic solution to the above equation? Even if there is not, is there any way to figure out the closed form expression behind the decimal $x = 0.629847$? I don't even care if the expression has $\cos$ or $\sin$ in it.

146204,Finding the Transformation to a Canonical form for a Quadric Surface,"I am attempting to calculate the intersection of quadric surfaces defined by $0 = X^T A X$,  $0 = X^T B X$, $0 = X^T C X$ with X = [x, y, z, 1]. Matrices A, B and C are real and symmetric. There are several methods for solving, most of which trace to Levin's Method (e.g. Xu , Wang ), or Dupont's rational method with implementation . Despite it's apparent flaws, I am interested in implementing Levin's method. I am stuck on the one of the steps in the method, where I am required to transform a ""pencil"" (two intersecting surfaces) into canonical form. The ""pencil"" is guaranteed to be a ruled surface quadric under the conditions that I am interested in. So, I need to find some matrix $P$ that transforms $Q_R: X^T R X$ (i.e. quadric of the pencil) into a canonical form.  In my specific problem, I know that my ruled surface is a Hyperbolic Paraboloid based on the eigenvalues of the pencil, which has a normal form of $x^2 - y^2 + z$. That is, find some congruence transform $R = P^T S P$, where R is the pencil, S is the canonical form (which I don't know what it is) and P is the transform I need to find. This is where I'm stuck. Levin's paper instructs me to firstly calculate a rotation matrix $R_u$ from the principle submatrix of $R$ (i.e. the upper 3x3), which can be achieved via an Eigendecomposition . Easy enough. Next, however, I need to find a translation matrix $T = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ a & b & c & 1\end{bmatrix}$, which gets me into a canonical form, $P = T R_u$. This is done by ""eliminating, by congruence transforms, as many other elements as possible"". (At this point, it  references a technical report from 1976 that I cannot find for the life of me ). Hence, I would like to ask: What is the canonical form that I need, given that I know the shape of the resultant (a hyperbolic paraboloid)?; and How do I perform the necessary congruence transforms to find my desired $P$?",['algebraic-geometry']

(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k) &\leq \sqrt{(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_k^2)}\sqrt{k}
\end{align*}$$ Square it: $$(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k)^2 \leq k(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_k^2)$$
Now I have to prove that: $$\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\left(\frac{a_1^2}{k} + \frac{a_2^2}{k-1} + \ldots + \frac{a_k^2}{1}\right) \geq k(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_k^2)$$

I am doing a Islamic Maths assignment at the moment for Humanities, and I came across the historical fact that Ibn al-Haytham proved Wilson’s theorem. I have seen on this wiki page: Wilson's theorem Wiki a natural number $n > 1$ is a prime number if and only if: ￼ $(n-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod n$ So I know what $(n-1)!$ means, its a factorial. But what does $\equiv$ with three lines there $(\mathrm{mod}\ n)$ mean. How does that mean its a prime number? $5$ is a prime number, ok. $5-1!$ is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1$ that equals $24$ and then $24$, $\equiv$ with three lines again, $(\mathrm{mod}\ n)$. What does this mean?
Been looking for a simple answer, but  can't find one... UPDATE Yes, I know what modular arithmetic is. It is a system where a number wraps around after a certain value in a loop. Like a clock time for example, but what does this mean in proving that the number is a prime.","['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'math-history', 'arithmetic', 'prime-numbers']"

If matrices A,B commute and have joint eigenbasis $v_i$. Then $v_i\otimes v_i$ generate the kernel. David Speyer provided correct answer which I accept.
The answer given before is wrong. AoB-BoA (xoy+yox)=AxoBy+AyoBx -BxoAy- ByoAx is no zero by no means. Moreover if it would be true the kernel would be n(n-1)/2 dimensional. However it is n-dimensional typically as it  can be seen by experiments.

Here is some background information: Zee has shown that the algebra of the Lorentz Group is formed from two separate $\operatorname{SU}(2)$ algebras [$\operatorname{SO}(3,1)$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{SU}(2)\times \operatorname{SU}(2)$] because the Lorentz Algebra satisfies: $[J_{+i},J_{+j}]= i*e_{ijk} [J_{k+}]$ $[J_{-i},J_{-j}]= i*e_{ijk} [J_{k-}]$ $[J_{+i},J{-j}]=0$ The representations of $\operatorname{SU}(2)$ are labelled by $j=0,\frac{1}{2},1,\ldots$ so the $\operatorname{SU}(2)\times \operatorname{SU}(2)$ rep is labelled by $(j_+,j_-)$ with the $(1/2,1/2)$ being the Lorentz 4-vector because and each representation contains $(2j+1)$ elements so $(1/2,1/2)$ contains 4 elements.","['lie-groups', 'group-theory']"

Both a) and b) converge on $|z|<1$ , because the geometric series is a convergent majorant. Both diverge on $|z|\geq 1$ , because neither $|z|^k$ nor $|z|^{(2^k)}$ is a zero sequence. ii) and iii) I have no idea how to approach. One idea is to try and write $\frac{d}{dz}\sum_{k=0}^\infty z^k$ and $\frac{d}{dz}\sum_{k=0}^\infty z^{(2^k)}$ as the derivative of a holomorphic function, but somehow I'm still missing the central idea, I guess. Any hints? So (thanks froggie) for iia) I have $\sum z^k = \frac{1}{1-z}=:f(z)$ . Then $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $B_1(0)$ (when $B_1(0)$ denotes the open unit disk). For iib) we look at $\sum z^{2^k}$ for $z=r\zeta$ with $0<r<1$ and $\zeta$ a $2^n$ th root of unity. Then $\sum z^{2^k} = \sum (r\zeta)^{2^k} = \sum r^{2^k}$ which obviously diverges for $r\to 1$ . So every ""holomorphic extension"" $f(z)$ would be automatically singular in every root of unity. Since these are dense on the unit circle, there cannot be a holomorphic function that is identic to $\sum z^{2^k}$ on $B_1(0)$ . The last argument seems to be a bit ""fishy"" to me. Any comments? For iii) we look at $\sum \frac{1}{2^k} z^{2^k}$ . This converges on $B_1(0)$ since $\sum \frac{1}{2^k} z^k$ is a convergent majorant. On the other hand we have $\frac{d}{dz} \sum \frac{1}{2^k} z^{2^k} = \sum_{k=1} z^{(2^k)-1} = \frac{1}{z}\sum\frac{1}{2^k} z^{2^k}$ which diverges because of ii).","['power-series', 'complex-analysis']"

I need to demonstrate that if all nonzero vectors of $V$ are eigenvectors of $T$, then there is one specific $\lambda \in K$ such that $T(v) = \lambda v$, for all $v \in V$. I understand that, if all nonzero vectors of $V$ are eigenvectors of $T$, then $T$ must be a scaling transformation. It just stretch or shrinks vectors, but doesn't change their  directions. So, the statement says that if it happens, then, there is a single $\lambda$ such that $T(v) = \lambda v$.

(Here I am using the Bounded Borel functional calculus.) Okay, it's a projection.  And I said the word ""spectrum"" in the above paragraph.  But surely it's more ""spectral"" than that.  Does the image of the so-obtained projection have anything to do with $x$ of a spectral nature? (This is an open-ended question, so please qualify what sort of spectral significance there is.  But some specific interpretations are below): Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $x$ which hence means that its in the spectrum of $x$.  Does the indicator function of the one point $\lambda$ applied to x via the Borel Functional Calculus project onto the eigenspace associated to it?  By considering $z*\chi_\lambda$ one can see that the image of this projection is a subset of the eigenspace of $\lambda$.  Does the other inclusion hold? More generally, if $\lambda$ is only a general element of the spectrum, is the indicator function of it applied to $x$ equal to a projection projecting onto some sort of ""spectrally significant space for $\lambda$?""","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

146486,Determine the conditional probability mass function of the size of a randomly chosen family containing 2 girls.,"Suppose that 15 percent of the families in a certain community have no children, 20 percent have 1, 35 percent have 2, and 30 percent have 3 children; suppose further that each child is equally likely (and independently) to be a boy or a girl. If a family is chosen at random from this community, then B, the number of boys, and G, the number of girls, determine the conditional probability mass function of the size of a randomly chosen family containing 2 girls. My attempt There are exactly three ways this can happen: 1) family has exactly 2 girls 2) family has 2 girls and 1 boy 3) family has all 3 girls The first one is pretty simple. Given that you are going to ""select"" exactly two children, find the probability that they are BOTH girls (it's a coin flip, so p = 50% = 0.5): $0.5^2 = 0.25$ So the probability that the family has exactly 2 girls is the probability that the family has exactly two children times the probability that those two children will be girls: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 35\% = 8.75\%$ Now find the probability that, given the family has exactly 3 children, that exacly two are girls. Now you flip 3 times but only need to ""win"" twice-this is a binomial experiment. There are 3 choose 2 = 3 ways to have exactly two girls: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd is a boy... interestingly the probability of having any particular permutation is just $0.5^3 = 1/8$ (because it's still $0.5 \times 0.5$ for two girls, then $0.5$ for one boy). So the chance of exactly 2 girls is: $\frac{3}{8}$ Now find the probability for having exactly 3 girls... that's easy, there's only one way, you just have all 3 girls, probability is just $\frac{1}{8}$.
Now, add these up $\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ So now use the percent of families with exactly 3 children to find this portion of the probability: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 30\%  = 15\%$ Hence, add the two probabilities... here is it in full detail $$\begin{eqnarray}\mathbb{P}(\text{contains 2 girls}) &=& \mathbb{P}(\text{2 children}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{2 girls, 2 children}) + \\ &\phantom{+=}& \mathbb{P}(\text{3 children}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{2 or 3 girls, 3 children}) \end{eqnarray}$$ $\frac{1}{4} 35\%  + 30\% \times \left(\frac{3}{8} +\frac{ 1}{8}\right)$ $8.75\% + 15\% = 23.75\%$ Is my attempt correct?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

First, let me briefly describe how to define this TQFT in the followings. Let $(M, \partial_{-}M, \partial_{+}M)$ be a cobordism. Let $\Omega$ be a ribbon graph in $M$. To define a TQFT, we first glue standard handlebodies with standard ribbon graphs $R$ (defined below) inside to the bottom boundary $\partial_{-}M$ by a given parametrization and also glue them to the top boundary $\partial_{+}M$ by a composition of a given parametrization and reflection map. Then we get a closed 3 manifold with a ribbon graph $\Omega'$, which is obtained by gluing $\Omega$ and $R$. We apply the invariant $\tau$ to this closed 3-manifold to obtain a TQFT. My question is that when we glue standard handlebodies to the boundaries, how do we define a framing of ribbon graphs, which are images of $R$. We need to know framing to calculate $\tau$. $R$ consistes of a coupon (a rectangle) and $g$ cap like bands attaching the coupon and several bands attaching one end to this coupon and the other end attached to the boundary of the handlebody. Here $g$ is a genus of the handlebody. If a hundlebody is genus $1$, then I think the framing can be determined by the image of meridian. But if a genus is greater than $1$, I don't know how to define a framing. The book and the paper don't mention how to define framings. Any help is apprecited.

$$\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[e^{-\frac{b}{2}X_T}]=e^{-\frac{b}{2}}\mathbb{P}^\mathbb{Q}(X_T=1)+e^{\frac{b}{2}}\mathbb{P}^\mathbb{Q}(X_T=-1)=e^{-\frac{b}{2}}\frac{1-x}{2}+e^{\frac{b}{2}}\frac{x+1}{2}$$ I have two questions: 1) How to compute $\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[Te^{-\frac{b^2}{4}T}]$ 2) How to get around the problem that $T$ might not be finite? Edit: 2) it's clear that $T<\infty$ under $\mathbb{Q}$, and so $T$ is $\mathbb{P}$-a.s. finite.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion']"
146684,Linear transformation of Levy processes,"Here is a question about linear transformation of Levy processes. It is stated in my reference (Cont and Tankov's Financial modelling with jump processes, Theorem 4.1) that a linear transformation of a Levy process is again a Levy process. But then, what would be its Levy exponent? Theorem 4.1 of the Book by Cont and Tankov (googlable) should provide an answer, but it is my opinion that the result is at best inaccurate. Indeed, equation (4.3) is a sum of a vector with a scalar; this confusion originates in the algebraic manipulation where the authors, after adding and subtracting appropriate quantities, implicitly write the integral of a scalar product as a scalar product against an integral. But this is clearly unfeasible unless the integrand is linear (which is not the case). Note that since the proof is based on the derivation of a Levy exponent, this also casts (for me) a shadow of doubt on the correctness of the first statement. For example: an independent sum of Levy processes is clearly a Levy process, but if levy processes are closed under linear transformations, then finite sums of any Levy process is a Levy process, regardless of possible dependence. Is that so? Seems like a rather big statement to me. Does anyone share my concerns or am I just being silly? Can anyone point out a better reference on results about linear transformation of Levy processes, in particular on the Levy exponent of a transformed Levy process? Thanks.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes']"
146686,How to prove $\mathcal{l}(D+P) \leq \mathcal l{(D)} + 1$,"Let $X$ be an irreducible curve, and define $\mathcal{L}(D)$ as usual for $D \in \mathrm{Div}(X)$. Define $l(D) = \mathrm{dim} \ \mathcal{L}(D)$. I'd like to show that for any divisor $D$ and point $P$, $\mathcal{l}(D+P)  \leq \mathcal l{(D)} + 1$. Say $D = \sum n_i P_i$. I can prove this provided $P$ is not any of the $P_i$, by considering the map $\lambda : \mathcal{L}(D) \to k$, $f \mapsto f(P)$. This map has kernel $\mathcal{L}(D-P)$, and rank-nullity gives the result. But if $P$ is one of the $P_i$, say $P=P_j$ then I'm struggling. Any help would be appreciated.

146706,"Radius of convergence of $\sum a_nz^n$, $a_n$ the number of divisors of $n^{50}$","I have to find the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum a_n z^n$ where $ a_n =$ number of divisors of $n^{50}$. Options available are: $1$ $50$ $\frac{1}{50}$ $0$ Please suggest how to proceed. Using the fact that $ d(n)\leq n$, we have $d(n^{50})\leq n^{50}$. Using the First Comparison Test, the series on the right converges if $\mid{z}\mid< 1$ and however does not converge if $\mid{z}\mid\geq 1$ and hence so does the series on the left. 
Radius of Convergence is 1. [Now for $a_n =n$, then $ R = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac {a_n}{a_{n+1}} =1. $ So,the series on the right converges for $\mid z \mid<1$] Now if $ z=1$, then the series $\sum a_n z^n$ takes the form $\sum d(n^{50})$ and since $ d(n^{50})\geq 1 $, by evoking the comparison test again, the series diverges for $z=1$.","['elementary-number-theory', 'real-analysis']"
146713,Subset of sequence space closed,"Is the set $E:=\{(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell^{\infty}\ |\; x_i \in \mathbb{C}, \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } x_n = 0 \}$ closed in $\ell^{\infty}$ equipped with $\lVert (x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \lVert_{\infty}=\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} |x_n|$? I've come to the following solution: Let $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \in \ell^{\infty}\setminus E$. So $\exists\, \varepsilon >0$ such that $\forall N \in \mathbb{N} \quad \exists m>N$ with $|x_m|>\varepsilon$. So for $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \in B_{\epsilon /2}((x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}})\quad \forall N\in\mathbb{N}\quad \exists m>N$ with $|y_m|>\epsilon /2$ and hence $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \in\ell^{\infty}\backslash E$. So $\ell^{\infty}\backslash E$ is open and $E$ is closed. Is this solution correct?",['functional-analysis']
