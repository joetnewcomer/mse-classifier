1585584,"Definition for ""relatively sequentially compact""","A topological space $X$ is sequentially compact if every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence. Let $X$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$.
I've seen two definitions for $A$ to be relatively sequentially compact in $X$: the closure $\overline{A}$ of $A$ in $X$ is sequentially compact, which means that every sequence in $\overline{A}$ has a convergent subsequence (with limit in $\overline{A}$). every sequence in $A$ has a convergent subsequence with limit in $\overline{A}$. Clearly, 1 => 2. Are these definitions equivalent? (I don't see how to reduce the sequence in $\overline{A}$ to a sequence in $A$, so it seems that they are not equivalent unless $X$ is something like a Fréchet-Urysohn in which points in the closure $\overline{A}$ can be approximated by a sequence in $A$. Then we could try to perform a diagonal argument.) If they are not equivalent, what is the right definition for abstract topological spaces $X$?","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology']"
1585612,The regular parametrized curve $\alpha$ has the property that all tangents pass through a fixed point.,"There are two questions to this problem: 1) Prove that the curve $\alpha(s)$ is a straight line. 2) Does the conclusion hold if $\alpha$ is not regular, ie. $\alpha'(s)=0$ for some $s\in I$. I proved the first part:
Since the lines pass through a fixed point $p$ we can write the condition:
$$\alpha(s) +\lambda(s)t(s)=d$$
Taking the derivative on both sides we get:
$$\alpha'(s)+\lambda'(s)t(s)+\lambda(s)t'(s)=0$$
$$(1+\lambda'(s))t(s)+\lambda(s)k(s)n(s)=0$$
Since the vectors $t$ and $n$ are perpendicular we have $1+\lambda'(s)=0$ and $\lambda(s)k(s)=0$. Here it follows that $\lambda'(s)=-1$ and $k(s)=0 \implies t'(s)=0$. So $\lambda(s)=-s+c$ and $t(s)=t_0$. Hence we can rewrite the condition:
$$\alpha(s)=\underbrace{a_0}_{d-a}+st_0$$
which is a line. What I am having trouble with is the 2nd question. My guess is that it should not be true but I don't see where the condition that the curve $\alpha(s)$ is regular has been used in the proof above. Clearly if $t=0$ at some point we can have a problem with the results that $\lambda'(s)=-1$ and $k(s)=0$ but these should be isolated points and not interfere with the general idea.",['differential-geometry']

1585641,$J=\lambda M$ where $M \in SO(2)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ instead of Cauchy-Riemann,"In ""visual complex analysis"" (Tristan Needham), the author explains that an application  $ f : \mathbb{C} \mapsto \mathbb{C} $ is complex differentiable on some domain if and only if it is everywhere locally an ""amplitwist"" [rotation+scaling] on this domain. Then he proceeds to explain the Cauchy-Riemann equations. I found Cauchy-Riemann to be a very poor capture of the above intuition. Indeed, lets start from the beginning: If $ f : \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^2$ is everywhere differentiable on some open domain $U$ then it can be locally approximated by its jacobian matrix: $$f(x) = f(x_0) + J_f(x_0) ( x - x_0 ) + o(\left\| x-x_0 \right\|) $$ Hence, when asking for complex differentiability: $$f'(z_0) = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0) }{z-z_0} $$ one asks for: $$f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0) ( z - z_0 ) + o(\left\| z-z_0 \right\|) $$ So the question is in what case can we identify the jacobian with a $J_f(x_0)$ with a complex number $f'(z_0)$ ? The action of the multiplication by a complex $re^{i\theta}$ number can be represented by an ""amplitwist"" hence, the jacobian matrix must be of the form:
$$ r 
\left(
  \begin{matrix}
        cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\
        sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) \\
  \end{matrix} 
\right)
$$ Indeed, for being well defined $f'(z_0)$ must not depend on the way we approached $z_0$, for example: $$f(z) = \overline{z}$$ has a well defined jacobian matrix $$
\left(
  \begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & -1 \\
  \end{matrix} 
\right)
$$ but depending on direction the local action of the matrix cannot be identified by a single complex number: $$f'(z_0) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0) }{h} = \frac{\overline{h}}{h} = \frac{re^{-i\theta}}{re^{i\theta} } = e^{-2i\theta}$$ Hence depending on the way you approach $z_0$ the local action of the jacobian is identified with some element of the unit circle. Now, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are always established the same way, by considering that two directional derivatives ( approaching either of the Cartesian axes ) must lead to the same complex number: \begin{equation}
f'(z_0) = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0 + ix) - f(z_0) }{ix} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0 + x) - f(z_0) }{x}, x \in \mathbb{R} \tag{1}
\end{equation} this leads to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and force the jacobian matrix to be: $$
\left(
  \begin{matrix}
        a & -b \\
        b & a \\
  \end{matrix} 
\right)
$$ but does not enforce any relationship between $a$ and $b$, this matrix only captures the fact that the images of $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ will be orthogonal with direction preserved. Which is what we enforced by (1) but it does not force every angle to be preserved (conformality). It is easy to build a matrix $$ r 
\left(
  \begin{matrix}
        cos(\theta) & -sin(\phi) \\
        sin(\phi) & cos(\theta) \\
  \end{matrix} 
\right)
$$ so that Cauchy-Riemann is respected but the application is not conformal. Then using $Im(z)$ and $Re(z)$ one can make the complex function matching the above jacobian. I beleive the three following are equivalent: $f$ is conformal $f$ has a jacobian matrix $J=\lambda M$ where $M \in SO(2)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ $f$ respects the Cauchy-Riemann equations and every of the four entries $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ are continuous. QUESTIONS I'm not sure how to prove the equivalence between 2 and 3: why would continuity and and angle preservation of two vectors imply angle preservation in general ? the other way around is geometrically more intuitive, as the jacobian is itself the result of a limit, $\lambda$ and $\theta$ of ""nearby"" jacobians must tend to those of jacobian of $z_0$ but I'm not sure how to write it. How to prove above equivalence, and if it is correct, then why using Cauchy-Riemann at all, as it requires the same computations and provides less information than the jacobian characterization ?",['complex-analysis']
1585646,$P(X) = X^6 - 11X^4 + 36X^2 - 36$ has a root in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for every $p$,"Problem: Prove that $P(X) = X^6 - 11X^4 + 36X^2 - 36$ has a root in $\mathbb{R}$, has no roots in $\mathbb{Q}$, but has a root in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for every $p$. What I have done: I think this is actually false. We can find this factorization: $P(X) = (X^2 - 2)(X^2 - 3)(X^2 - 6)$. So we deduce that there are 6 different roots in $\mathbb{R}$, and there are no roots in $\mathbb{Q}$. For $p \not= 2,3$ combining Hensel's Lemma and multiplicativity of Legendre Symbol we can say that there is a root in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. But for $p = 3$ we can't find $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{6}$ in $\mathbb{Q}_3$ beacuse they should have absolute value $|\sqrt{3}|_3 = |\sqrt{6}|_3 = 3^{-1/2}$ which is not possible cause, as sets, $|\mathbb{Q}_p|_p = |\mathbb{Q}|_p$. A root of $(X^2 - 2)$ in $\mathbb{Q}_3$ should be in $\mathbb{Z}_3$ because $\mathbb{Q}_3$ is the field of fractions of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ which is DVR and hence integrally closed (is that true?). But we can't solve $a_0^2 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$. $\mathbb{Q}_2$ is almost the same cause we must find a root for $(X^2 - 3)$ but $3 \not \equiv 1 \pmod  8$.

1585940,Every irreducible component of $Z(\mathfrak a)$ has dimension $\geq n-r$,"I had a lot of trouble with this question and now have written down a solution I think is correct.  Is there anything I have maybe overlooked in this proof or didn't do rigorously?  If it is correct, I'd like to leave the proof as a reference for myself and others. For $k$ algebraically closed, let $R = k[X_1, ... ,X_n]$, and suppose the ideal $\mathfrak a$ in $R$ can be generated by $r$ elements.  Show that every irreducible component of $Z(\mathfrak a)$ has dimension $\geq n-r$. Let $\mathfrak a = (f_1, ... , f_r)$.  A maximal irreducible closed set contained in $Z(\mathfrak a)$ corresponds to a minimal prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ containing $\mathfrak a$, so we need to show that if $\mathfrak p$ is a minimal prime containing $\mathfrak a$, then the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is $\geq n - r$.  If any of the $f_i$ are units, then $Z(\mathfrak a) = \emptyset$, so we can assume this is not the case.  I think this can be done by induction on $r$. If $r = 1$, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is exactly $n-1$ (by the Hauptidealsatz).  Now assume $r > 1$.  Let $\mathfrak a_0 = (f_1, ... , f_{r-1})$.  We have two cases: either $f_r \in \mathfrak a_0$ (that is, $\overline{f_r} = 0$ in $R/\mathfrak a_0$) or else not.  Suppose it is.  Then $\mathfrak a = (f_1, ... , f_{r-1})$, and by induction, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is $\geq n - (r-1) > n -r$. Suppose $f_r \not\in \mathfrak a_0$.  Then in the ring $R/\mathfrak a_0$, the ideal $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $\overline{f_r}$ (easy to check that $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is not the whole ring).  Then the height of $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is $1$ by the Hauptidealsatz.  So there must be another prime $\mathfrak p_0$ such that $\mathfrak a_0 \subseteq \mathfrak p_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak p$, with no primes between $\mathfrak p_0$ and $\mathfrak p$, and no primes between $\mathfrak a_0$ and $\mathfrak p_0$.  Now $\mathfrak p_0$ is a minimal prime containing $\mathfrak a_0$, which has $r-1$ generators, so by induction, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p_0$ is $\geq n - (r-1)$.

Suppose $g\colon\Omega\to\Bbb C$ is a function such that for every $f\in L^p$, the pointwise multiplication $gf\in L^1$. Is it necessarily the case that $g\in L^q$? It is not hard to show that $f\mapsto\int_\Omega fg\ d\mu$ is a linear functional. So $g\in L^q$ if and only if this functional is continuous.

Why is this difficult? It is consistent with $\sf ZF+DC$ that every linear functional on a Banach space is continuous. In such case $g$ has to be in $L^q$, since the functional is indeed continuous.

To do this, assume $h(y)\neq 0$ for $y\neq 0$. Now, we replace $x$ by $h(y)$ from the sysem above, and from the identity: $\dot{x} = \dot{y}\  h'(y)$, we get the following equation for all values of $a$: $-y + a(a_0 + a_1y+ a_2y^2 + ...)

But then the $-y$ term on the LHS of the equation above is never cancelled with anything, so the equation, after matching terms by terms, cannot be true for every $y\neq 0$. Thus $h(y)$ does not exist in this case. Therefore, $h(y) = 0$ is the only choice, which implies $x = 0$. But if this is the case, then $0 = -y$, so $y = 0$ as well.

I know that by the isomorphism theorems for rings we can take the quotients successively, and so $$\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z})[x] $$ as the map $\mathbb{Z}[x] \to (\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z})[x]$ defined by $\sum_{n} a_n x^n \mapsto \sum_{n} \overline{a_n} x^n$ is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel $(p)$. Thus it remains to study the quotients $$(\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z})[x]/(x^2+3) $$
for $p \in \{3,5\}$. If $p=3$, $(x^2+3)=(x^2)$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/3 \mathbb{Z})[x]$, and by using polynomial division all distinct coset representatives can be reduced to the following list of 9 elements $$\{0,1,2,x,1+x,2+x,2x,1+2x,2+2x\}. $$ Moreover, it can shown that the list above gives 9 distinct cosets, as no difference of two distinct elements of the list is a multiple of $x^2$. Since $1$ and $x$ generate two distinct additive groups of order $3$, the additive group of our quotient ring is not cyclic. Elementary group theory then shows $$(\mathbb{Z}/3 \mathbb{Z})[x]/(x^2)^+ \cong (\mathbb{Z}/ 3 \mathbb{Z})^2 $$ as additive groups. I was then about to conclude that the multiplication on the quotient is then compatible with the usual one in $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2$, but this is wrong! It can be seen that the quotient is not isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2$ as a ring, because the former contains a nonzero element (represented by $x$) whose square is zero, while the latter contains no such elements. If $p=5$, a full list of coset representatives is of length 25 $$\{0,1,2,3,4,x,1+x,2+x,3+x,4+x,2x,1+2x,2+2x,3+2x,4+2x,3x,1+3x,2+3x,3+3x,4+3x,4x,1+4x,2+4x,3+4x,4+4x \} .$$ And once again, one can see that these represent 25 distinct cosets.

We have shown that $$||\min(X,M)||_p \leq c$$ for all $M \geq 0$ and want to conclude that $$||X||_p \leq c.$$ In the lecture notes it is written that this follows by Monotonce Convergence theorem. But how does this work precisely? So we have $$\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} \min(X,M)=X$$ and therefore $$||X||_p = ||\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} \min(X,M)||_p=E[(\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} \min(X,M))^p]^{1/p}=\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty}E[\min(X,M)^p]^{1/p} =\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} ||\min(X,M)||_p \leq \lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} c = c $$ Is this correct?

How to define an injective function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow A$ without using the choice axiom? My effort: Let $$f(1) \colon= f_1(1).$$ Now as $f_2 \colon \{1, 2\} \longrightarrow A$ is injective, we must have $f_2(1) \neq f_2(2)$ .
So we can conclude that either $f_2(1) \neq f_1(1)$ or $f_2(2) \neq f_1(1)$ .
That is, either $f_2(1) \neq f(1)$ or $f_2(2) \neq f(1)$ . So the set $f \big(\{1, 2 \}\big) - f\big(\{1 \}\big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_1$ be the smaller  element of the set $\{1,2\}$ such that $f_2 \left(k_1 \right) \neq f_1(1)$ . We define $f(2) \colon= f_2 \left( k_1 \right)$ . Then $f(2) \neq f(1)$ . Now $f_3 \colon \{1, 2, 3\} \longrightarrow A$ is injctive, so the set $f_3\big(\{1,2,3\}\big)$ has exactly three elements, whereas the set $f\big(\{1,2\}\big)$ has exactly two elements. Thus the set $f_3\big(\{1,2,3\}\big) - f\big(\{1,2\} \big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_2$ be the smallest element of the set $\{1, 2, 3, \}$ such that $f_3 \left( k_2 \right) \not\in f\big(\{1,2\}\big)$ . Let's define $f(3) \colon= f_3 \left( k_2 \right)$ . Then $f(3) \not\in f\big(\{1,2\} \big)$ . So $f(3) \neq f(1)$ and $f(3) \neq f(2)$ . Suppose that $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq 2$ , and suppose also that $f(1), \ldots, f(n)$ have beeen defined so that $f(i) \neq f(j)$ for any $i , j\in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ such that $i \neq j$ . Now as the function $f_{n+1} \colon \{ 1, \ldots, n+1 \} \longrightarrow A$ is injective, the set $f_{n+1}\big( \{1, \ldots, n+1 \}\big)$ has exactly $n+1$ elements. On the other hand, the set $f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ has exactly $n$ elements. So the set $f_{n+1}\big(\{1, \ldots, n+1 \}\big) - f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_n$ be the smallest element of the set $\{1, \ldots, n+1\}$ such that $f_{n+1} \left(k_n \right) \not\in f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ . So let's define $f(n+1) \colon= f_{n+1} \left( k_n \right)$ . Obviously, $f(n+1) \neq f(i)$ for any $i \in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ . In this way, we have defined a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow A$ such that $f(m) \neq f(n)$ for any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m>n$ . Is this proof good enough? If so, then is it rigorous enough? Or, are there issues of correctness or rigor?","['elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology', 'functions']"

1587073,How to find the images of the external semidirect product?,"Once we have two groups, let's say $H$ and $G$, it's fairly simple to find all split extensions of $G$ by $H$ by looking at the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(H)$ and homomorphisms $\tau: G \rightarrow \text{Aut}(H)$. Then, the extensions are described by the semidirect products $H \rtimes G$. In a similar way, once we have a group $A$, we can find a normal subgroup on $A$ and write $A$ as a semidirect product. My question is, on the first case, unless the homomorphism $\tau$ is fairly trivial, we end up with a group $H \rtimes G$ that we know little about. The operation defined by the external semidirect product is awkward to handle, which leaves me pretty lost when trying to define who exactly is $H \rtimes G$. The last one I tried was looking at the following split extension: $1 \rightarrow C_3 \rightarrow G \rightarrow C_2 \times C_2 \rightarrow 1$. So $G$ is a extension of the Klein four-group by $C_3$, the cyclic group of three elements. There are a few possible homomorphisms $\tau: C_2 \times C_2 \rightarrow \text{Aut}(C_3)$, so I decided to start with a simple one, a projection: $\tau(a, b) = a$ (I used this notation because $\text{Aut}(C_3) \cong C_2$). And that was pretty much all I could do. Sure $G$ is isomorphic to one of the five groups of order $12$, but which one? Would I need to go through all groups of order $12$, searching for one with a normal subgroup isomorphic to $C_3$, whose quotient group is isomorphic to $C_2 \times C_2$? There must be more I can extract from the external semidirect product, otherwise it would make it pretty pointless for this objective. What am I missing here?","['abstract-algebra', 'semidirect-product', 'group-theory']"
1587125,Integrating a matrix function involving a determinant and exponential trace,"I am trying to find the normalizing constant for a probability distribution and ran into a difficult integral. When $X$ is an $p \times k$ matrix, $a>0,$ and $g>0,$ how can I compute $$\int \left|I_k + \frac{g}{a}X^TX\right|^{-d/2} \text{exp}\left\{-\frac{1}{2}\text{tr}[aX^TX]\right\}dX$$ where the bars indicate the determinant? I've wanted to change variables. For example, to send $X \to \left|I_k + \frac{g}{a}X^TX\right|$ but this isn't injective. Similarly, I've considered other transformations, e.g. using a singular value decomposition, but haven't had much success. If $k=1$ then I can use a result like this one: Integration of radial functions? but I don't know of any similar formula that helps when $k>1.$ Edit: I claim the integrand is the kernel of a spherical matrix variate density in $X.$ From the Matrix Variate Distributions book referenced in my comment, a random matrix $X$ is said to have a spherical distribution if $X = \Gamma X \Lambda$ where the equality is in distribution and $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ are orthogonal matrices of appropriate dimension. The claim follows from two observations: That $\text{tr}[a(\Gamma X \Lambda)^T\Gamma X \Lambda] = \text{tr}[aX^TX],$ which follows easily from the othogonality of $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ and the cyclic property of the trace That $\left|I_k + \frac{g}{a}(\Gamma X \Lambda)^T\Gamma X \Lambda\right| = \left|I_k + \frac{g}{a} \Lambda^T X^T X \Lambda \right|  = \left|I_k + \frac{g}{a}X^TX\right|,$ which we get using orthogonality and the matrix determinant lemma. The Gupta and Nagar book discusses densities, including normalizing constants, of spherical matrix variate distributions. So it is likely possible to calculate the integral by recognizing this kernel. Alternatively, we might do some sort of matrix integration by parts in which we differentiate the determinant term with respect to $X$.","['matrices', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'integration', 'linear-algebra']"

I know that conformal mappings from the unit disk to polygons can be described by Schwarz-Christoffel-Transformations, and with the help of several articles I finally came up with the hypergeometric function $e^{\pi/4 i}z\; _2F_1(1/2,1/4,5/4,z^4)$ that maps - as said - the unit disk conformally to the square $(-1,1)^2$ . I used Mathematica to plot this function, and the result is perfectly fine. My question is now: What is the inverse of this function? There is a wikipedia article that gives a similar definition of the inverse in terms of Jacobi's Elliptic Function $cn$ , but this doesn't work with my plotting. I think I have to adjust this only a bit to get what I want, but I was not able to so far. Thx for your help in advance!","['complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry']"
