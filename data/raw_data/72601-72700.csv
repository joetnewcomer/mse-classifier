892012,Why do we care about simple groups rather than indecomposable groups?,"A first thing that we do to analyze something is ""divide and conqur."" So it is natural to consider simple groups. In the same way, it appears to be natural to consider indecomposable groups . However, no one taught me about indecomposable groups and I know it quite recently. Of course, indecomposable groups is larger class than simple groups. Having said that, it doesn't answer my question fully because a lager concept is sometimes easier to deal with (for example, $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$). Is there any reason that we care about simple groups rather than indecomposable groups? Added : From the comment to DustanLevenstein — For example, in module theory, indecomposable modules looks be treated equal with simple modules. importance of indecomposable modules and simple modules seems be at the same level. What's the difference between these?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'soft-question']"

892063,On group-theoretic shorthand notation,"I have often seen shorthand notation used in group-theoretic contexts and I believe it is called ATLAS notation.  However, even with some searching I have not been able to find a satisfactory summary of the meaning of this notation. I have found the meaning of some things, like $A \times B$ for the direct product of $A$ and $B$, $G=A.B$ for a group with a normal subgroup isomorphic to $A$ and for which $G/A \cong B$, $A:B$ when $A.B$ is a split extension, and $A \cdot B$ when $A.B$ is not split. However, I have seen things like $4 \times 4 \times 4$ and $3^3.\mathrm{SL}_3(3)$.  What do numbers by themselves, possibly with powers, represent - the cyclic groups of those orders, perhaps? What is a good, complete reference for this notation, available freely online?  If no such thing exists, a nice explanation in an answer would also work. Thanks.

892155,Brownian Motion and stochastic integration on the complete real line,"I'm struggling to understand stochastic integration over intervals containing zero, i.e. integrals of the form $\int_{a}^{b} X_s \, d B_s$ where $-\infty \leq a < b \leq \infty$, $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ is some adapted process and $(B_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ is a Brownian motion. Integrals of this type appear over and over again in several articles (of established authors) and the usual martingale techniques (Burkholder-Davis-Gundy, Ito-isometry, etc.) are happily applied as if $a>0$, but always without any justification, so I guess that there's some ""standard way"" these type of integrals are understood. I've searched for literature on this subject but couldn't find anything, any reference on this is highly appreciated! As far as I understand, one can define filtrations, (adapted) stochastic processes and  martingales in the usual way as all these definitions don't depend on the index set. A Browian motion on $\mathbb{R}$ is then simply an almost surely continuous stochastic process with independent increments such that $B_0=0$ and $B_t-B_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$ for $s \leq t$. Apparently, one way to realize it is by constructing a two-sided Brownian motion $B$ by taking two independent Brownian motions $(B_{1,t})_{t \geq 0}$, $(B_2,t)_{t \geq 0}$ and letting them run in opposite directions: $B_t := B_{1,t}$ if $t \geq 0$ and $B_t := B_{2,-t}$ if $t < 0$. Here is my first problem: Is there a filtration (on $\mathbb{R}$) in which the two-sided Brownian Motion is a Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}$? The two filtrations of the two-sided Brownian motion increase in opposite directions... Now, assuming that the filtration problem can be solved somehow, a naive way of defining a stochastic integral with respect to a two sided Brownian motion $B$ on an interval $(a,b)$ containing zero would be
$$\int_{a}^{b} X_s \, d B_s := \int_{a}^0 X_s \, d B_s + \int_0^a X_s d B_s,$$
where 
$$ \int_a^0 X_s \, d B_s := - \int_0^{-a} X_{-s} \, d B_2(s),$$ 
but with this definition I see no way of associating a martingale on $\mathbb{R}$ with this integral. Is there another definition? To give you an example where such a stochastic integral is used, see https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipeccati/Home/Publications-by-G-Peccati/PEC1.pdf On page 7 (Thm. 3.1) a Brownian motion on the real line is introduced and on page 10 in the proof a stochastic integral over an interval containing zero appears.","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-calculus', 'brownian-motion', 'probability']"

892257,Why sample statistics converge to the right parameter,"We know that for sample/empirical distribution function $F_n(x)$ we have that a) $F_n(x)\xrightarrow[p]{}F(x)$ (pointwise convergence) b) $\dfrac{\sqrt{n}(F_n(x)-F(x))}{\sqrt{F(x)(1-F(x))}}\xrightarrow[d]{}N(0,1)$ c) $F_n$ converges uniformly in probability to F.

892259,Is there a geometric interpretation for lower order terms in sum of squares formula?,"So we know that $\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$ and if we think about making a square layer out of $n^2$ unit cubes, and then placing a square layer of $(n-1)^2$ unit cubes on top of the first layer centered upon the center, and so forth, we can build a chunky square pyramid of $\sum_{k=1}^n k^2$ unit cubes that has height $n$ and base side length $n$. As $n$ gets large, we can think of this as a Riemann sum for the volume of an ordinary square pyramid of height $n$ and base side length $n$, which has volume $n^3/3$. And indeed the leading term of $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$ is $n^3/3$. So I was wondering, does the quadratic (and or linear) term in  $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$ have any geometric interpretation in terms of the ordinary square pyramid, e.g. being a multiple of surface area of the triangular sides or something?","['geometry', 'calculus']"

892278,"If a plane intersects a regular surface at exactly one point, then it is the tangent plane","Question Let a regular surface, $S$, intersect a plane, $P$, at only one point, $p_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Show that the plane coincides with the tangent plane to the surface at $p_0.$ Remarks The problem seems so easy and unassuming, however, I have been stuck on it for several days. I have come up with proofs but I am unconvinced by any so far. Please provide as elementary a proof as possible. Nothing greater than multivariable calculus and some linear algebra (if necessary). I have a feeling that it may be best solved by contradiction but my attempt does not follow this strategy. Attempted Proof Let $S$ be a regular surface and $P$ be a plane which passes through $p_0$. Locally, any regular surfaces may be represented by a function $z=f(x,y)$. 
Hence the tangent plane, $L(x,y)$, to $S$ at $p_0$ is 
\begin{align*}
L(x,y) &= f(x_0, y_0) + f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).

A(x-x_0) + B(y-y_0) + C(z-z_0) = 0.

$$

$$
where $\hat{n} = (A,B,C)$ is the normal vector to the plane and $p=(x,y,z)$ is any point on the plane.
Note that since $p$ is on the plane it cannot be on the surface by hypothesis. Here is where I start to get stuck. Help would be appreciated. I'm sure that there is a simple way of thinking about, and proving it. Thanks","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $q \colon B \rightarrow h_2(\Bbb C)$ send each $(V,W) \in B$ to the matrix $$\left[ \begin{matrix} \vert V \vert^2 & V\overline{W} \\ W \overline{V} & \vert W \vert^2 \end{matrix} \right].$$ I want to show that the image of $q$ is topologically $S^2$ and that $q$ is a fibration with fibers $S^1$. What I think will help so far: If $\vert V \vert = 0$ or $\vert V \vert =1$, the image of any $(V,W) \in B$ will be $$\left[ \begin{matrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right] \text{ or } \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{matrix} \right], \text{ respectively}.$$ If we fix $V \in \Bbb C$ with $0 < \vert V \vert < 1$, we know that any point in $B$ with first coordinate $V$ will have a second coordinate whose squared norm is $1-\vert V \vert^2$.  Specifying the argument of the second coordinate fully determines the point's image by $q$. Suppose I have a matrix $M$ in the image of $q$, say $q(V,W) = M$.  Then $\vert V \vert^2 = M_{11}$ and $\vert W \vert^2 = M_{22}$. We know the value for $V\overline{W}$, namely $M_{12}$. If we choose a value for the argument of one of $V,W$, the argument of its counterpart is forced to satisfy Arg$(V)$ -  Arg$(W)$ = Arg$(M_{12})$. What I want to eventually do is generalize this map so that it acts on the quaternions and the octonions.  In these cases, $q$ will be a fibration with image $S^4$, $S^8$, and fibers $S^3$, $S^7$, respectively.  These maps are Hopf maps.

892540,Constructing lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold,"Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold. To keep it simple, let us take $M = \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with linear coordinates $(x^1,\ldots,x^n,y^1,\ldots,y^n)$ and the standard symplectic form $\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n dx^i \wedge dy^i$. A submanifold $\Lambda$ of $M$ is said to be Lagrangian if, for each $p \in \Lambda$, $T_p\Lambda$ is a lagrangian subspace of $T_pM$, that is, $\omega_p \vert_{T_p\Lambda} \equiv 0$ and $\dim T_p\Lambda = \frac{1}{2}\dim T_pM$. Equivalently, if $\iota : \Lambda \hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion map, then $\Lambda$ is Lagrangian if and only if $\iota^*\omega = 0$ and $\dim \Lambda = \frac{1}{2} \dim M$. This seems like a reasonably easy definition, but in practice, how does one really construct a lagrangian submanifold of $(M,\omega)$? For instance, given a smooth function $f : U \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^4$, can one explicitely construct a Lagrangian immersion out of $f$? I read a little bit about generating functions of Lagrangian submanifolds, but am unsure if this relates here.

I've tried separation of variables. $$ \dfrac{dx}{x\ln(x)}= \dfrac{4dt}{t}$$ From here,  taking the integral of both sides I end up with..., $$ \ln(\ln|x|) = 4\ln(t) + C$$ Now, since it's a double ln, I'm guessing we need to raise it to $e$ twice.
\begin{align*}e^{\ln(\ln|x|)} &= e^{4\ln(t)}+ e^C\\
\ln(|x|) &= t^4 + e^C \end{align*}
One more time...,
$$ x = e^{t^4 + e^C}= e^{t^4}e^{e^c}$$ is it right so far? Initial values are $x(1) = 3$, so
$$ 3 = e^1e^{e^c}$$ so i end up with
$$\ln(3) - 1 = e^c$$ So the particular solution is then, 
$$x = e^{t^4}e^{\ln(3)-1}$$

892586,"Convex surface on which any two points $a,b$ can be joined by a curve of length $(\pi/2-\epsilon)|a-b|$","I am trying to solve an exercise on page 13 of the book Metric structures on Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces by Gromov. Construct a closed, convex surface $X$ in $\mathbb R^3$ such that any two points $a,b\in X$ can be joined by a curve $\gamma\subset X$ of length $$\ell(\gamma)\le c|a-b| \tag1$$ where $c<\pi/2$ . Here $c$ is independent of $a,b$ . Remarks Here $|a-b|$ is the Euclidean norm of the vector $a-b$ . The geometric meaning of   inequality (1) is that the surface is not too twisted: a bug crawling from $a$ to $b$ along the surface does not have to travel much further than if it flew directly from $a$ to $b$ . A closed convex surface is precisely the boundary of a convex bounded set. Gromov calls the smallest value of $c$ for the surface satisfies the above the distortion of $X$ . Other authors call it the constant of quasiconvexity . Some ideas A sphere has distortion $\pi/2$ . Indeed, any curve connecting antipodal points (distance $2r$ ) has length at least $\pi r$ , where $r$ is the radius. Ellipsoids are no good; they are distorted more than spheres. Look at the vertices of the shortest axis. More generally, every centrally symmetric surface has distortion at least $\pi/2$ . Indeed, let $a\in X$ be a nearest point to the center of symmetry, and $b$ its antipode. Any curve connecting $a$ to $b$ stays outside of a ball with diameter $ab$ , and therefore has length at least $\frac{\pi}{2}|a-b|$ . One can consider closed curves instead of surfaces, hoping to get inspiration from there. But the distortion of a closed curve cannot be less than $\pi/2$ ; proof here . That is, a circle is the least distorted closed curve. Among non-symmetric $X$ , a natural candidate is the regular tetrahedron, but it does not work. The dihedral angles $\alpha=\cos^{-1}(1/3)$ are too small and difficult to get around: $c$ cannot be less than $1/\sin (\alpha/2) = \sqrt{3}>\frac{\pi}{2}$ . Minkowski sum of a tetrahedron and a sphere of sufficiently large radius might work, but the length estimates look scary.

Of course, if $\langle g_i\rangle =\langle g_j\rangle $, we append only $\langle  g_i\rangle $ into our result set. We call all distinct subgroups of the form $\langle g_i\rangle $ to be the first-generation. (Note that the number of the first-generation subgroups is at most $n$.) To get $(i+1)$-th generation from $i$-th generation inductively, we construct the subgroup $S$ from each two elements of $i$-th generation $S_1, S_2$ to be $$S=\langle S_1,S_2\rangle .$$ Obviously, if generated subgroup is already in previous generations, we do not call it $(i+1)$-th generation, hence every subgroups of $G$ has the unique generation number. We do this construction until the number of the typical generation subgroups to be $0$, since we get all subgroups of $G$.

893084,$1/r^2\int_{\mathbb{S}_r}u-u(x)$ converging to $\Delta u(x)$?a,"When reading some papers on PDEs, the following shows up several times: For a $C^{\infty}$ function $u$, $\frac{\int_{\mathbb{S}_r(x)}u-u(x)}{r^2}$ converges to $1/2n\Delta u(x)$ uniformly on compact sets as $r\to 0$. Here $\mathbb{S}_r(x)$ is the sphere of radius $r$ centred at $x$, and $n$ is the dimension of the Euclidean space. I am wondering how we can prove this. I think we might use Taylor's approximation, but ended up with something of the form \begin{equation} \langle D^2u(x)(y-x),(y-x)\rangle/\lvert y-x\rvert^2,\end{equation} and we need to show this goes to $1/n\Delta u(x)$.

Although it's a well-known result, I'd like to make sure it is correct as it took a good few minutes to come up with the proof. Exercise. Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a finite group and $g\in G$ . Show that $|g|$ is finite. Proof. Consider the set of powers of $g$ , that is, $X = \{g^n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ . Note that this set is in bijection with $\Bbb N$ , hence it is infinite. But $G$ is finite by assumption, so the elements of $X$ cannot all be distinct. In particular, let $m,k\in\Bbb N$ such that $g^m = g^{m+k}$ and $k$ is the smallest natural number with this property. These numbers are guaranteed to exist by the previous step in the argument. But then: $g^m = g^{m+k}\Rightarrow g^{-m}g^m = g^{-m}g^{m+k}\Rightarrow g^0 = e_G = g^k$ . Hence $|g| = k<\infty$ and we are done. Out of interest (I know the stronger result (Lagrange's theorem) by rote but have not yet formally learned it), I decided to push my luck and prove an intermediate result: Corollary. Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a finite group and $g\in G$ . Then $|g|\leq |G|$ . Proof. Note that the set $X$ from before can have at most $|G|$ elements (this is trivial). Consider the subset $Y = \{g^m,g^{m+1},\dots,g^{m+k}\}$ . Since $k$ is the smallest integer such that $g^m = g^{m+k}$ , the elements of $Y$ are distinct. Clearly $Y$ can have at most $|G|$ distinct elements as it is a subset of $X$ . Since these are all distinct, $Y$ can have no more than $|G|$ elements in general. But $Y$ has $k$ elements, and hence $k = |g| \leq |G|$ as desired. This is more involved than what I've done previously in linear algebra and basic set/function/relation theory.

It is definitely possible if we require only that $a$ be a (non-strict) local minimum; the function $x^2\sin^2(1/x)$ exhibits such behavior at zero. It is definitely impossible if $f$ is a polynomial, since we can write $f(x) = (x-a)^mg(x) + f(a)$, where $g(a)\neq 0$, and $f(x)-f(a)$ behaves locally like $(x-a)^m$.

893463,prove that any integer greater than or equal to 8 can be represented as the sum of nonnegative integer multiples of 3 and 5,"This problem asks to use Well Ordering Principle to prove any integer greater than or equal to  8 can be represented as the sum of nonnegative integer multiples of 3 and 5. Here's where I'm at: For the sake of contradiction assume that there is a nonempty set C such that,
C :: = {n >= 8 (only positive integers) | n CAN'T be represented as a linear combination of 3 and 5} By WOP C contains a least element m. m >= 9 because n=8 can be represented as a linear combination of 3 and 5. I'm stuck here. I have to find a contradiction that shows C is an empty set but not sure how to approach this. Any hints? Thanks.",['discrete-mathematics']
893496,verifying extrema found by Lagrange multipliers,"This question was inspired by reading this problem: Prove the inequality $\frac 1a + \frac 1b +\frac 1c \ge \frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3} +\frac 74$ Suppose I have a function $f(x,y,z)$ with continuous partial derivatives which I want to maximize and minimize on the portion of the plane $x+y+z=k$ with $x,y,z>0$. If I use Lagrange multipliers and find the points $(a_i,b_i,c_i)$ for $1\le i\le4$ where extrema could occur [by solving the system $f_x=\lambda\cdot1, f_y=\lambda\cdot1, f_z=\lambda\cdot1$], and $f(a_1,b_1,c_1)=2$ and $f(a_2,b_2,c_2)=f(a_3,b_3,c_3)=f(a_4,b_4,c_4)=\frac{7}{4}$, what additional information, if any, do I need in order to conclude that 2 is the maximum value of $f$ or that $\frac{7}{4}$ is the minimum value of $f$ on the set of points being considered?","['inequality', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"
893507,Is there a specific name for a directed graph that is composed of only loops?,"Recently I have been doing practice questions for my Final exam tomorrow and this one question appeared that was interesting, but I couldn't seem to find the other half of the answer to it. Q:
Given the relation $\{(2,2), (3,3)\}$, draw it's associated directed graph and classify the relation. A:
Draw two vertices that have a loop(this is the first half where I draw it of course) . Classification of relation: ? Does anyone know what this relation would be classified as? I know what the vertices are called, which are referred to as isolated vertex, but what would be relation be classified as?","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
893513,How to prove that $1/|z^4-4z^2+3|\le 1/3$ if $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=2 $?,"Show
  $$\left\lvert \frac{1}{z^4-4z^2+3} \right\rvert \leq \frac{1}{3},\, \text{ if } |z|=2.$$ I am sure it is pretty easy and I am overlooking something. So this is equivalent to
$$3 \leq \left\lvert z^2-1\right\rvert\cdot\left\lvert z^2-3\right\rvert.$$
I know $z^2$ is on the circle of radius 4 centered at the origin in $\mathbb{C}$. So I am now thinking of the distance from $z^2$ to $1$ and the distance from $z^2$ to $3$ to help show the bound is true. I am trying to find the minimum distances of $z^2$ to $1$ for example, and the way I have been going about this is by explicitly looking at the distance and making a function $f(x,y)$ and trying to compute its minimum, but I don't know how to really do this without breaking into cases of $x\geq 0$ and $x <0$ if $z=x+iy$ so I am wondering if this is overkill and if there is another simpler way.","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"
