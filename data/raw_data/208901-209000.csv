4190334,A few questions about topological spaces,"Statement $1$ : Given a non-constant map $f: (\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable}) \to (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite})$ , show $f$ is continuous iff, for each $y \in \mathbb R$ , the set $f ^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable Proof of Statement $1$ : Suppose $f$ is continuous. For each $y \in \mathbb R, \ \{y\}$ is $\tau_{cofinite}$ -closed, so $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ must be $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed ( $\ne \mathbb R$ since $f$ is non-constant), therefore $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable. Suppose now $f^{–1}(\{y\})$ is countable for each $y \in \mathbb R$ . For any closed $K \in (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite}), \ K$ is either $\mathbb R$ or finite . Now $f^{–1}(\mathbb R) = \mathbb R$ is $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed, and if $K$ is finite, then $f^{–1}(K) = \bigcup_{y \in K}f ^{–1}(\{y\})$ is a finite union of countable sets, therefore countable, therefore $\tau_{cocountable}$ -closed again and hence $f$ is continuous. My Questions about the proof above : How does the bolded "" therefore "" above follow? By definition, any(?) subset $X$ in the domain of $f$ is of the form $\mathbb R = X \cup X^c$ where $X^c$ is the countable complement of $X$ . But that makes $\mathbb R$ countable. In the other direction, how does the italicized finite follow? If $K$ is finite, then $\mathbb R = K \cup K^c$ implies $\mathbb R$ is finite. In general, does $\tau_{cocountable}$ contain countable sets and does $\tau_{cofinite}$ contain finite sets? And maybe trivially, how do we know $f^{-1}(\mathbb R) = \mathbb R?$ Question $2$ : Are the following pairs of spaces homeomorphic? (i) $\mathbb Q \cup (0, 1)$ and $\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q$ (as subspaces of $(\mathbb R, \tau_{usual}))$ ; (ii) $(\mathbb C, \tau_{disc})$ and $(\mathbb C, \tau_{cocountable})$ ; (iii) a circle with one point removed (in $\mathbb R^2$ with $\tau_{usual}$ ) and $(\mathbb R, \tau_{usual})$ ; (iv) $\mathbb N$ with topology $\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}, \{5, 6\}, \{7, 8\}, \ldots$ and all unions of these, and $\mathbb N$ with topology $\{1, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{5, 7\}, \{6, 8\}, \{9, 11\}, \{10, 12\}, \ldots$ and all unions of these. The following have answers (v) $(\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable}), \ (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite})$ (vi) $\mathbb R^2$ and the surface of a sphere with one point removed (natural metric
topologies here) (vii) $(\mathbb Q,l_x), (\mathbb Q, l_y)$ , where $x, y$ are two distinct rational numbers and $l_p$ is included-point topology Book's answers to (v) and (vii): (v) No. The statement ‘there is a countably infinite closed subset’ is
(obviously) a homeomorphic invariant, is true in $(\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable})$ and is false in $(\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite})$ (vii) Yes. The map $h : \mathbb Q → \mathbb Q$ given by $h(x) = y, h(y) = x, h(z) = z$ when $z \ne x$ or $y$ is routinely checkable to be a homeomorphism. My answers/questions regarding question $2$ above : (i) $\mathbb Q, (0, 1)$ are not compact and so their union is not compact meaning there's no continuous inverse function from $\mathbb Q \cup (0, 1)$ (ii) Any function from a discrete space to an indiscrete space is continuous. Since idenity $i$ is continuous and bijective, $i$ should work here to show homeomorphism (iii) I think this is a special case of Stereographic projection (iv) Any inverse image of an open set in $\mathbb N$ is a union of $2$ -sets. Since the given $2$ -sets are open, their union is open as well. This works in both directions, so a continuous function with its continuous inverse likely exists. I am not sure how to find a concrete homeomorphism, but would $f(x, y) = (x, y – 1)$ if $y$ is odd and $f(x, y) = (x + 1, y)$ if $x$ is even work? Are my answers to (i) through (iv) correct? If not (or if incomplete), how do I improve them? (v) This question might be trivial, but I am still new to the very basics of topology. Consider $f: (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite}) \to (\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable})$ . Every $Y \in (\mathbb R, \tau_{cocountable})$ must have a pre-image $X \in (\mathbb R, \tau_{cofinite})$ . By definition, every $X$ is open, but for $f$ to be continuous $X$ must be cocountable. Correct? (vi) It's yet another special case of Stereographic projection. Correct? (vii) Is $h(y)$ a typo? Did they mean $h^{-1}(y)?$ Thanks.","['elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology']"

4190405,"Asymptotic behavior of recurrence $x_{n+1}=\mbox{Stdev}(x_1,\dots,x_n)$","Here $x_1>0$ is the initial condition and $x_{n+1}$ is defined by $$x_{n+1}=\Big[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2 -\frac{1}{n^2}\Big(\sum_{k=1}^n x_k\Big)^2 \Big]^{1/2}.
$$ Clearly, $x_n=\lambda_n \cdot x_1$ where $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots$ is a sequence of positive real numbers not depending on the initial condition $x_1$ . For instance, $\lambda_1=1,\lambda_2=0$ . It seems, based on empirical evidence, that $\lambda_n\sim \gamma \cdot n^{-\alpha}$ for some constants $\gamma\approx 0.54$ and $\alpha\approx 0.35$ . Substituting $x_k$ by its asymptotic expansion in the first formula defining the sequence $(x_n)$ , one gets the following, after trivial computations and rearrangements: $\alpha^2=(1-2\alpha)(1-\alpha)^2$ . Let $\tau=(13+3\sqrt{33})^{1/3}$ . Then we have, according to Mathematica: $$\alpha=\frac{1}{3}\Big(2+\frac{2^{5/3}}{\tau}-\frac{\tau}{2^{2/3}}\Big)\approx 0.3522011.$$ Is this correct? Also, I could not find how to determine the value of $\gamma$ .

4190706,Differentiability of flow of non-autonomous ODE,"I am looking for any reference on the regularity of flows of non-autonomous ODEs. Any suggestions on books or articles are very much welcome. I have had little luck finding any usable results. Let us assume that $$
f: [0,1]\times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N
$$ is continuous, satisfies the Lipschitz condition (i.e., it is Lipschitz continuous in the second argument), and is continuously differentiable in the second argument. Furthermore, assume that its derivative in the second argument, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ , also satisfies the Lipschitz condition. Consider the flow $\varphi : [0, 1] \times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N$ of the ODE $$
\dot x = f(t, x)
$$ Meaning that $\varphi$ is defined via: \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\frac{d}{dt}\varphi(t, x_0) = f(t, \varphi(t, x_0)) \\
\varphi(0, x_0) = x_0
\end{cases}
\end{equation} For fixed $t\in[0,1]$ , I expect that $\varphi(t, \cdot):\mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N$ is differentiable. In fact, I would expect the derivative $\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}(\cdot, x_0)$ to satisfy the usual variational equation \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}

Oftentimes, non-autonomous systems are dismissed at the very beginning with the note that it is possible to reduce to the autonomous setting. In my case, this will not be possible since the autonomized right-hand side will not be in $C^1$ . I would be grateful if somebody could point me towards helpful literature.

4190722,Monoid where every element has a one-sided inverse is a group.,"Let $M$ be a monoid such that: for all $x \in M$ , there exists $y \in M$ such that $xy = 1$ or $yx = 1$ . Is it true that $M$ is a group? In other words, if every element of $M$ has a one-sided inverse, then does it follow that every element of $M$ is invertible? My thoughts Suppose if I constrain every element to say, have a right inverse, then the statement does hold true. Indeed, let $x \in M$ be arbitrary and $x'$ be a right inverse of $x$ . We show that $x'x = 1$ as well. First, let $x''$ denote the right inverse of $x'$ . Then, we have $$x'x = x'x(x'x'') = x'(xx')x'' = x'x'' = 1.$$ In fact, the above proof gives us a more refined result: If $x, x', x'' \in M$ satisfy $xx' = x'x'' = 1$ , then $x'$ is the inverse of $x$ (and thus, $x = x''$ ). In words: If a right inverse of an element has a right inverse, then the element is invertible. Thus, if we are looking for a counterexample, then there must necessarily be an element $x \in M$ which has a right inverse but not a left inverse. Moreover, any right inverse $x'$ of $x$ cannot have a right inverse. Motivation/Context/Source I didn't come across this in a textbook or anywhere else. I came up with this question because I was aware of the constrained example mentioned above and was wondering if this is true. I don't have much background about monoids either. I am aware of some properties of finite semigroups/monoids (existence of idempotent powers, Green's relations) but those don't seem to be very fitting here. I haven't even been able to rule out that I can get a counterexample with a finite $M$ .","['monoid', 'abstract-algebra', 'examples-counterexamples']"
4190733,Can every countable locally-finite group be embedded into $S_\infty$?,"Let's define $S_\infty$ as the group of all permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ with finite support. It is not hard to see, that every finite group can be embedded in $S_\infty$ . That is because any finite group $G$ can be embedded into $S_{|G|}$ by Cayley Theorem and $S_{n} \cong \{\sigma \in S_\infty|\sigma(m)=m \forall m > n\}$ . On the other hand, all subgroups of $S_\infty$ are locally-finite, because $S_\infty$ is locally-finite itself. Indeed, if we look at $\sigma_1, ... , \sigma_n \subset S_\infty$ with respective finite supports $S_1, ... , S_n$ , then $\langle \sigma_1, ... , \sigma_n \rangle \leq S_{|S_1 \cup ... \cup S_n|}$ . I wonder whether every countable locally-finite group can be embedded into $S_\infty$ . The problem is, that even if they are, that statement can not be proved using the construction from Cayley theorem, because permutations arising from action of infinite group upon itself by left multiplications do not generally have finite support.","['permutations', 'infinite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory']"

4190825,Why is this definition of topological space equivalent to the common one?,"While comparing the definition of a topological space among books, I found one book [1]  whose definition seems to differ from the others. Here it is: Definition : Let $X$ be a non-empty set. A class (defined by the book as a ""set of sets"") $T$ of subsets of $X$ is called
a topology on $X$ if it satisfies the following two conditions: The union of every class of sets in $T$ is a set in $T$ The intersection of every finite class of sets in $T$ is a set in $T$ This definition omits the usually present condition that the empty set and $X$ itself must be in $T$ . It also adds the condition that $X$ is not empty. Shortly after this definition, the author writes: We observe that the empty set and the full space are always open sets
in every topological spaces, since they are the union and intersection
of the empty class of sets, which is a subclass of every topology. Which doesn't make sense to me, given the definition. <deleted> Why is $X$ in $T$ ? Why does $X$ need to be non-empty? Update (Much later): I discovered that the book adopts a convention by which all sets under discussion are restricted to $X$ . Not realizing/mentioning that was entirely my fault. [1] George F.

I also tried various ways to put a lower bound on the $(n-b)(n^2-b)$ in hope it will limit the size of $b$ or $n$ , but none seemed to heve worked. I have a hypothesis that the product here is just an additional , constraint meaning that the following claim also holds: if $(n-b) | n^3$ , then $n^2-b$ does not. I also wrote a program to check it for $n$ and $b$ up to $10^5$ and it holds.  However, I still didn't manage to prove it.

Question: In the process of applying the binomial expansions to the third term of the large $x$ behavior of the digamma function, I end up with the following double sum: $$S = -\sum_{d=2}^\infty \Big(\sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor} \frac{B_{2n}}{2n} \begin{pmatrix}-2n\\d-2n\end{pmatrix}2^{2n}\Big)\big(\frac{-i}{2x}\big)^d$$ What is the closed-form formula for the inner $n$ -sum, for $d$ odd and for $d$ even?

Since the automorphism group of $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$ is of order 4, which is prime to 315, this would prove that there is a group of order 5 in the center of $G$ . By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups is $\equiv 1\mod{5}$ , and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups must divide $3^2\cdot 7$ , which implies that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups $n_5$ is either 21 or 1. Using the same method, we see that $n_7$ is either 15 or 1 and $n_3$ is either 1 or 7. I at least want to prove that one of the Sylow sugroups is normal. Using a counting argument doesn't help me here, since there are at most $21\cdot4=84$ elements of order 5 and there are at most $15\cdot 6=90$ elements or order 7. I am unsure of how to bound the elements of order 3 or 9, but adding the maximum number of elements of order 3 or 9 with $84+90$ won't get us a number higher than 315, so we won't get a contradiction. Another possible way to prove there exists a normal sylow subgroup is by looking at their normalizers. Suppose that none of the Sylow groups are normal, so $n_5=21$ , $n_7=15$ , and $n_3=7$ . Then there exists normalizers of certain Sylow groups of order $15$ , $21$ , and $45$ . I am unsure how to use this fact to find a contradiction.

Can I use any convergence theorem, instead, even if I am not working in $L^1([0,1])$ ? Clearly $(f_n(x))$ converges pointwise to $$f(x) = \begin{cases}0 & \left(x \leq \frac12\right)\\ x-\frac12 & \left(x > \frac12\right),\end{cases}$$ which is not in $\mathcal C^1([0,1])$ and thus not in $\mathcal F$ .

Is it more productive or rigorous to think of a function as a rule that tells us how to ""map"" or ""associate"" elements from one set to another, or as a set of ordered pairs containing elements of one set (the domain) ""mapped to"" or ""associated with"" elements of another set? Or is there a context in which it makes more sense to think of a function one way vs another? To expand on this, I've realized that I conceptualize each of the following ways of defining a function in two different ways: $$\text{Define}\; f: X \to Y \;\;\text{by}\;\;f(x)=y$$ or $$\text{Define the set}\; f = \{(x,f(x)) \mid x \in X\}$$ When a function is defined in the first manner, I tend to think of it as a specific ""map"" or ""rule"" that tells us exactly how to take an element from the set $X$ and associate it with a single element from the set $Y$ . I tend to think of this function as an object that ""completes an action"" in a sense - where that action is taking an element from $X$ and mapping it to $Y$ . However, when a function is defined in the second manner, it no longer seems appropriate to think of it as something that is ""completing an action"". The function no longer seems like a ""tool"" in the sense that it does when it's defined in the previous manner. It seems as though the action is already completed. In other words, instead of viewing the function as an object that maps elements from $X$ to elements of $Y$ , I tend to view the function as the result of a mapping from $X$ to $Y$ . But don't both of these ways of defining a function define the same mathematical object? I seem to be conceptualizing the same thing in two very different ways, which makes me wonder if my intuition is off.","['elementary-set-theory', 'algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'education']"

4191361,"Using burnside's lemma to calculate a smaller subset of unique, color-agnostic bracelets","We have a child's toy, which is a ball made of 12 colored wedges (3 Red, 3 Green, 3 Blue, 3 Yellow).  Our child asked the sensible question 'how many different patterns are possible?'. In researching the answer, I discovered it's a mathematically complex and interesting question!  My math level is advanced high school/entry level university - sufficient to determine that Burnside's lemma is the right tool and to more or less understand its application to this problem.  This is essentially a 'bracelet' problem, as I understand it.  But I would like to solve not for the total unique bracelets, but for a smaller subset of unique arrangements that are color agnostic (I'll define this here as 'unique patterns', lacking a more accurate term).  E.g. -RRY-GGG-BBB-YRY- is considered the same arrangement as -GGB-RRR-YYY-BGB-.  The pattern is the same even though the colors are switched. From my research, my starting point was a similar related problem asked at the link below and answered very helpfully by Marko Riedel: Necklace problem with Burnside's lemma As Marko showed using Burnside's lemma, the total arrangements of that 6 bead 'bracelet' (or a simpler toy of 6 wedges of three colors) would be 11.  But the smaller subset of 'unique patterns' which are color agnostic are 5.  It was easy enough to identify those 5 manually, but what I am interested in is how Burnside's lemma could be correctly applied to find the unique (color agnostic) patterns possible on this more complex toy of 12 wedges in 4 colors. My starting point was to calculate the higher amount of all possible 'bracelets'.  The identity gives $12! /( 3!^4) = 369{,}600$ .  And unless I'm mistaken, the reflection symmetries yield no candidates and the only rotation symmetries which do are by 4 and 8 spaces (giving 24 each).  This gives: (369,600 + 24 + 24) / 24 = 15,402 possible bracelets. This gives me an upper limit, but how would I then reduce this to the subset of 'unique patterns' which are agnostic as to color placement, as it's not feasible to calculate this manually. Any advice would be greatly appreciated by this math curious family!

of $L$ yields a contact structure $\eta$ such that $$e(\eta) = e(\xi) + 2PD[L]$$ where $PD: H_1(M)\to H^2(M)$ is Poincaré-Duality.
I am however fairly certain, that I have proven the same result with $2PD[L]$ replaced
by $PD[L]$ , here is my proof: Choose a tubular neighbourhood $V$ of $L$ , such that on each component the contact structure is given by $\ker d\theta + r^2d\phi$ . Start with a vector field $X$ tangent to $\xi$ , which is in general position with the zero section,
does not vanish over $V$ and is given by $\partial_r$ on the boundary of $V$ , then $e(\xi) = PD[X\cap M]$ . After the Lutz twist the $X$ I have in mind is not tangent to $\eta$ , however we
can replace $X$ on $V$ by $\partial_r$ , such that $X$ now vanishes along $L$ .
The new Euler class is thus given by $$e(\eta) = PD[X\cap M] = e(\xi) + PD[L].$$ Can anyone spot a mistake in my argument, or is the statement in Geiges wrong?","['contact-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'contact-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

Now suppose there is a graph with $6n-1$ edges or less. Lemma Let $v$ be a vertex with minimum degree $d$ in $G$ . Then $d=3$ .

Now I could say ""The power in the numerator is higher than the denominator which means the numerator goes faster to $0$ , and the limit exists"".

4192238,Convergence of winning probability in a one-player dice-throwing game,"In this (one-player) game, the player starts with a total of $n$ points.  On each turn, they choose to throw either a four-, six-, or eight-sided die, and then subtract the number thrown from their point total.  The game continues until the player's point total reaches zero exactly, and they win, or falls below zero, in which case they lose. The strategy does not seem obvious.  (Even for the simple case of $n=5$ , one must do a calculation.)  And dynamic programming techniques show that the strategy is not straightforward.  For $n≤20$ , the four-sided die is optimal, except for $n=5, 6, 13, 20$ , where the six-sided die is optimal, and $n=8, 14, 16$ , where the eight-sided die is optimal. For large $n$ , the probability of winning approaches $0.456615178766744$ , which is not a number that I recognize.  ( The ISC does not recognize it either .) It's not particularly surprising that the probability of winning converges as $n$ increases, because the probability of winning with $n$ points is the mean of probability of winning with $n-i$ points, taken over a small range of $i$ .  Considering the probabilities as a sequence, each element lies inside the range of the previous few elements, and tends to be in the middle of that range. As one goes farther out in the sequence, variations away from the mean tend to be damped out. My questions are: What's this $0.456615178766744$ ?  (For a single $d$ -sided die the probability of winning approaches $\frac 2{d+1}$ , but for more dice the problem seems harder.) Is there any regularity to the optimal move, as $n$ increases? Is there any good way estimate a good strategy, short of exhaustive computer calculations?  For example, in the $n=7$ situation, the four-sided die is significantly better than the six-sided die.  Is there some way to see this, or at least to guess that it is so? Someone must have studied this before.  Does the problem have a name?

4192299,Intuitions for probability on countably infinite sample spaces,"I've learnt over the years that measure theory is subtle and counterintuitive, and many things that seem obvious actually have counterexamples. My intuition serves me well in the world of finite sample spaces, but if I step outside that I can't trust it. However, I'm wondering if I can safely step into the world of infinite but countable sample spaces, such as the natural numbers. I know that in this case there is no uniform distribution, which is a significant difference. Other than that, does anything substantial change when passing from probability distributions on finite sets to probability measures on countable sample spaces? I'm wondering in particular about basic intuitions like the following, which of course are wrong for general sample spaces but true in the finite case. Unless you're doing something very weird the appropriate $\sigma$ -algebra is always the power set. Defining a probability measure is equivalent to assigning a probability to each outcome, such that they sum to 1. If an outcome has probability 0, the appropriate intuitive interpretation is that it can't happen. I ask partly because I know that the following definitely is wrong: The expectation of a function $f\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ is always given by $\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}p(k)f(k)$ . In fact this is only true if the series is absolutely convergent, and the expectation is undefined otherwise. This makes me suspect that there might be important subtleties that I'm missing in my other bullet points as well, but it's surprisingly hard to find anything concise on this topic that doesn't gloss over this kind of point. (Note: there are several related questions that are about finitely additive measures on countable sets.

Clearly $e^{cz}$ is entire, for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ , so the cardinality of the set of entire functions is at least that of the continuum. I thought that the set of entire functions would have a cardinality exceeding that of the continuum, but I have what I think is a proof to the contrary, though I feel like I'm missing something. Let $f$ be an entire function and let $g$ be the restriction of $f$ to the open unit disk. Then $f$ is an analytic continuation of $g$ and by uniqueness of analytic continuations, $f$ is uniquely determined by $g$ . But $f$ is holomorphic, so by the Cauchy integral formula, $g$ is completely determined by $f$ on the unit circle. Therefore $f$ is completely determined by its values on the unit circle. If we let $h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the polar parameterisation of $f$ on the unit circle, then since $f$ is holomorphic, $\text{Re}(h(z))$ and $\text{Im}(h(z))$ are (periodic) real continuous functions and $f$ is completely specified by them. But real continuous functions are uniquely specified by their values on the rationals, so the cardinality of the set of real continuous functions is that of the continuum. Therefore the set of entire functions also has the cardinality of the continuum. Am I missing something?

4192694,Correct my proof about : $x^{x^{x^{x^{x^{x}}}}}$ is convex for $0.25<x<0.27$,"Let $0.25<x<0.27$ then define : $$f(x)=x^{x^{x^{x^{x^{x}}}}}$$ Claim: The second derivative of $f(x)$ is strictly positive . Proof : Let $0.25<x<0.27$ then define : $$g(x)=x^{x^{x^{x}}}$$ $g(x)$ is convex . Proof : Fact 1: On $(0.25,0.27)$ the function $k(x)=x^x$ is convex Proof : Left to the reader using derivatives and logarithm . Fact 2 : On $(0.25,0.27)$ the function $l(x)=x^{x^x}$ is concave increasing Proof : Trick : we consider the function $l(x)=x^{k(x)}$ we have : $$l''(x)=x^{k(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) k''(x) + 2 x k'(x) + (x \ln(x) k'(x) + k(x))^2 - k(x))$$ Now we have as obvious things : $$x^2 \ln(x) k''(x)<0$$ $$2xk'(x)<0$$ $$(x \ln(x) k'(x) + k(x))^2 - k(x)<\left(0.25\ln\left(0.25\right)k'\left(0.25\right)+k\left(0.25\right)\right)^{2}-k\left(0.27\right)<0$$ So the function is indeed concave and we deduce that $l(x)$ is increasing . Fact 3: Now we consider the function : $$g(x)=x^{l(x)}$$ We have : $$g''(x)=x^{l(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) l''(x) + 2 x l'(x) + (x \ln(x) l'(x) + l(x))^2 - l(x))$$ A calculation gives : $$l'(x)>1.15$$ So : $$2xl'(x)>0.5\cdot 1.15$$ In the same vein we have : $$2 x l'(x) + (x \ln(x) l'(x) + l(x))^2 - l(x)>2\cdot0.25\cdot1.15+\left(0.25\ln\left(0.25\right)l'\left(0.27\right)+l\left(0.27\right)\right)^{2}-l\left(0.27\right)>0$$ So the function $g(x)$ is convex . We are done. Fact 4 : Now we introduce the function : $$h(x)=x^{g(x)}$$ We have : $$h''(x)=x^{g(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) g''(x) + 2 x g'(x) + (x \ln(x) g'(x) + g(x))^2 - g(x))$$ As $g''(x)>0$ then $x^2 \ln(x) g''(x)<0$ We have again $g'(x)<0$ and It's not hard to show $(x \ln(x) g'(x) + g(x))^2 - g(x)<0$ using again particular values I mean maximize and minimize the different functions . We deduce that on $0.25<x<0.27$ the function $x^{x^{x^{x^{x}}}}$ is concave and increasing. Now introducing a similar function to $h(x)$ and using the same way the conclusion follow . We are done !

4192726,Complex structures given by a submersion vary holomorphically,"$\DeclareMathOperator{\pr}{pr}$ Let $\phi: \mathcal X \to B$ be a proper submersion of complex manifolds, with central fiber $X = X_0$ . Then by the Ehresmann theorem we may shrink $B$ such that there exists a $\mathcal C^\infty$ -trivialisation $$T: \mathcal X \cong X \times B$$ such that $\phi = \pr_B \circ T$ . In general, $T$ will not be holomorphic. However, according to Voisin[1], one can choose $T$ in such a way, that the fibers of the projection $\pi = \pr_X \circ T: \mathcal X \to X$ are complex submanifolds of $\mathcal X$ . Assume such a $T$ is given. Then in the proof of Proposition 9.7 the following situation appears: Suppose $t_1, \dotsc, t_r$ are local coordinates of $B$ . As $\phi$ is a submersion, one can locally (in a neighbourhood of a point lying over $0 \in B$ ) choose additional coordinates $z_1, \dotsc, z_n$ such that $(z_1, \dotsc, z_n, \phi^* t_1, \dotsc, \phi^* t_r)$ is a local system of coordinates on $\mathcal X$ , and $\phi$ is given by $(z, t) \mapsto t$ (dropping the $\phi^*$ by abuse of notation). Then $z_1|_X, \dotsc, z_n|_X$ also give local coordinates on $X$ . Hence we can write $$\pi(z, t) = (\pi_1(z,t), \dotsc, \pi_n(z,t))$$ for $\pi: \mathcal X \to X$ , where $\pi_j$ is the component corresponding to $z_j$ . Question : Voisin claims that the $\pi_j$ depend holomorphically on $t_1, \dotsc, t_r$ . How can I see this? I guess it comes from the fact that the fibers of $\pi$ are complex manifolds, but I'm not sure.

From another point of exercise we have $\dim (U_i)\le \dim(X)$ for every $i\in I$ . This implies $$\sup_{i\in I}\dim (U_i)\le \dim (X).$$ Now let $Z_0\subset Z_1\subset \cdots \subset Z_n$ be a sequence of irreducible closed sets in $X$ . By definition, $Z_0\ne \emptyset$ . So pick any $x\in Z_0$ , and using hypothesis choose any $x\in U_i$ for same $i\in I$ . Then we have a sequence $$Z_0\cap U_i\subseteq Z_1\cap U_i\subseteq\cdots\subseteq Z_n\cap U_i$$ of closed subsets of $U_i$ . Question 1. The $Z_j\cap U_i$ are distinct? $(j=0,\dots, n)$ We claim that if $Z_j\cap U_i\ne\emptyset $ , then it is irreducible for each $i=0,\dots, n$ . Suppose this is not true. Then $Z_j\cap U_i=A\cup B$ for proper closed sets $A, B\subset Z_j\cap U_i$ . Now $Z_j$ is the union of closed sets given by $$Z_j=\bigg(\text{cl}_X(A)\cup \text{cl}_X(B)\bigg)\cup (Z_j\setminus U_i) \tag 1$$ Question 2. Is this previous equality true? Could you explain to me why? Since $Z_j\cap U_i\ne \emptyset$ , the closed set $Z_j\setminus U_i\subset Z_j$ . Since $Z_j$ is irreducible we have $Z_j=\bigg(\text{cl}_X(A)\cup \text{cl}_X(B)\bigg )$ Question 3. $\text{cl}_X(A)$ and $\text{cl}_X(B)$ are closed in $Z_j$ ?

W.L.G. assume that $Z_j=\text{cl}_X(A)$ , then $$A=\text{cl}_X(A)\cap U_i=Z_j\cap U_i $$ a contradiction.

I have two solutions, one of them is good, correct and quite ""straightforward"", but the second is very controversial, and I want you to explain to me why it does not work. $1)$ For large $n, f(n)$ becomes a large integer so is divisible by some prime $p$ say. This means that the polynomial $f(X)$ modulo $p$ factors as $f(X) \equiv(X-n) g(X) \bmod p$ . There are two cases to consider. $f(n) \equiv 0 \bmod p^{2}$ $f(n) \not \equiv 0 \bmod p^{2}$ which means that $g(n) \not \equiv 0 \bmod p$ . In the first case $f(n)$ is not square free. In the second case, the derivative $f^{\prime}(x)$ satisfies $f^{\prime}(n) \not \equiv 0 \bmod p$ , so we can use Hensel's lemma to find an $n^{\prime} \equiv n \bmod p$ for which $f\left(n^{\prime}\right) \equiv 0 \bmod p^{2}$ . This means that $f\left(n^{\prime}\right)$ is not square free. I liked this solution, I also have a question: is it necessary to add a restriction on the number $p$ here, it must be taken large enough so that the derivative of the polynomial modulo $p$ does not become identically zero, then everything works? $2)$ Consider the polynomial $f(x)=c_{k} x^{k}+c_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\ldots+c_{1} x^{1}+c_{0}$ , where $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x], \operatorname{deg} f \geq 1$ .

4193059,Choosing functions so $p'(r) = g(r) \cdot (1- \frac{p(r)}{k(r)})$ is solvable,"I am trying to modify the verhulst equation to give it certain desirable qualities, however I keep hitting dead ends. Here is the general form of the equation I am starting with: $$ p'(r) = g(r) \cdot (1- \frac{p(r)}{k(r)}) $$ Obviously both functions $g(r)$ and $k(r)$ will be defined before solving the equation. My question is essentially how I can find an equation for each of those functions such that the following properties are true. Scope I only care about the behavior of the relevant functions between 0 and 1 for $r$ . All values/variables will be Real values, no Complex or anything like that. Desired Properties All integrals should be solvable symbolically, no taylor series or any sort of numerical approximations. Likewise $p(r)$ should be symbolically differentiable and integratable. As well as be computationally feasible and contain only common math functions like Log, e^x, factorial, modulus, +, -, but nothing more obscure or hard to program like Gamma or Hypergeometric functions. Basically something I can translate to source code easily. The resulting function $p(r)$ is $p(0) = 0$ and monotonically increases approaching infinity as r approaches 1. $g(r)$ is monotonically increasing as well with $g(0) = 0$ and with it approaching infinity as r approaches 1. Likewise $k(r)$ is monotonically increasing approaching infinity as $r$ approaches 1 however in this case $k(0) > 0$ . More specifically the value of k when r is 0 should be defined as a constant defined in the function k. For example $k(0) = K$ Both $k(r)$ and $g(r) should have constants defined such that they act as shaping variables to adjust Attempts While I have not been able to solve the problem with all the desirable properties above I have gotten close. but I am always missing one or more of the above properties. Thankfully I can show some graphs of examples of the above functions to give you an idea of what I'm looking to do. Attempting $g(x)$ I have mostly been using the following equation for $g(x)$ . $$ g(r)=A*\frac{r}{(1-r)^B} $$ In this case $A$ and $B$ are my shaping variables. Here is a plot of the function showing different shaping variables. I will plot it below. In the above I am showing the function with shaping variables A=1,B=1 and A=4,B=4 and A=1,B=4. If I use this equation for g I can solve the problem just fine and get a result that meets my desired property when k(r) is a constant. But not when $k(r)$ is a more complex function with my desired properties. Incase it is helpful I will show the solution I get for $p(r)$ to the above equation when k is a constant K. $$ g(r) = K-K e^{-\frac{A(1-r)^{-B}\left((1-r)^B-B(r-1)r+r^2-1\right)}{(B-2)(B-1)K}} $$ Note : This solution seems to have the odd property that B cant be 1 or 2 exactly. Which is kinda unexpected. Which would produce the following plot for A=5, B=3, K= 10. Attempting $k(r)$ For $k(r)$ I have tried several different functions. None of them produce something I can integrate by hand and neither can mathematica. There are some combinations with a different function for g (for example if I drop the B exponent) where I can integrate, but they have different problems. One simple attempt I made, which as I said fails, but gives an idea as to what I am going for is where $k(r)$ is defined the same as $g(r)$ but simply adding some constant $K$ . $$ k(r) = g(r) + K $$ That would produce the following plot when the following shaping constants are used A = 0.1, B = 2, and K = 10 Combining It All Now I couldn't figure out how to combine the above equations exactly, as I said the integrals don't seem solvable. But I have gotten some similar equations with different shaping variables to integrate and work. For example if I dropped the $B$ shaping variable then solve the differential equation I can get a solution that sort of works. Here is one set of functions that almost works: $$ g(r) = \frac{A \cdot r}{1-r} $$ $$ k(r) = B(-r-\log(1-r)) + K $$ Giving the final solution of... $$ p(r) = \frac{A\left((-K)^{\frac{A}{B}+1}(Br+B\log(1-r)-K)^{-\frac{A}{B}}-Br-B\log(1-r)+K\right)}{A+B} $$ Plotting that I get a graph that looks almost exactly like what I wanted. In this case the blue line is $g(r)$ , the red dashed horizontal line is $k(r)$ and the red dashed vertical line is the vertical asymptote at $r=1$ . There are a few problems with this, however, that, despite being close, isnt working. Specifically my solution has two problems, the first one being more dire than the second (if it were just the second I could live with it though it isn't ideal). The property I mentioned above, #2 isnt satisfied. As far as I can tell $p(r)$ can not be symbolically integrated. Since both $g(r)$ and $k(r)$ only have a single shaping variable each it isnt ideal for the application I am trying to use it for (this is why in the above failed attempts I added a second shaping variable). The graph is exactly what I am looking for, a sigmoid that tappers off to infinity on the tail end. Conclusion So what I am asking is either someone maybe help me find a way to combine and fix my above attempts to work as expected, or, suggest entirely new functions I can use that will be easier to work with and is solvable with the desired properties.","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'derivatives']"

4193210,Is the alternating sum of prime numbers $2-3 + 5-7 \dots$ asymptotic to $\frac{1}{2}p_k$?,"I tried to show that $|2-3 + \dots (-1) ^ {N + 1} p_N| \sim \frac{1}{2}p_N$ but I don't know if what I did holds. I would be very interested in getting advice. At the end of the question there is a bonus speculation which is both very stupid and interesting, at least, from my point of view... $p_k$ is the $k$ -th prime number, expanding the inverse function of the logarithmic integral for $k\geq2$ we get: $$p_k= k \ln(k)+k \ln(\ln(k))-k+O\left(\frac{k }{\ln(k)}\ln(\ln(k))\right)$$ I wonder if it is correct to sum over the big $O$ notation and exploit the algebra of this notation $$O\left((-1)^{N+1}\frac{N \ln\ln N}{\ln(N)}\right)+O\left((-1)^{N}\frac{(N-1) \ln\ln (N-1)}{\ln(N-1)}\right)+\dots=O\left(\frac{(N) \ln\ln (N)}{\ln(N)}\right)$$ If this is legit, we can write $$\sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^{k+1}p_k=\sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^{k+1} k \ln(k)+\sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^{k+1} k \ln\ln(k)-\sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^{k+1} k +O\left(\frac{N \ln\ln N}{\ln(N)}\right)$$ To estimate the value of these sums, let's set $ N = 2x + 1 $ $$\sum_{k=1}^{2x+1}(-1)^{k+1}k \ln(k)=\sum_{k=1}^{x+1} (2k-1) \ln(2k-1)-\sum_{k=1}^x 2k \ln(2k)=\\\sum_{k=1}^{x+1} 2k \ln(1-\frac{1}{2k})-\sum_{k=1}^{x+1}  \ln(2k-1)+2(x+1)\ln(2(x+1)).$$ $$\sum_{k=1}^{x+1}  \ln(2k-1)=(x+1)\ln(2)+\ln\left((x+\frac{1}{2})!\right)-\frac{1}{2}\ln(\pi)$$ The Lauren series for $y \ln(1-\frac{1}{y})$ for $y\to \infty$ is: $\ \ -1-\frac{1}{2y}-\frac{1}{3y^2}-\frac{1}{4y^3}+O(y^{-4})$ $$\sum_{k=1}^{x+1} 2k \ln(1-\frac{1}{2k})\sim -(x+1)-\frac{1}{4}H_{x+1}-\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta(k)}{2^k(k+1)}$$ $H$ is the Harmonic number $H_{x+1}\sim\ln(x+1)+\gamma$ $$\sum_{k=1}^{x+1} 2k \ln(1-\frac{1}{2k})=-x+O(\ln(x))$$ By the Stirling's approximation : $\ln(y!)\sim y \ln(y)-y+O(\ln(y))$ $$\sum_{k=1}^{x+1}  \ln(2k-1)= x (\ln(x)+\ln(2)-1)+O(\ln(x))$$ $$\left|\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1}(-1)^{k+1} k \ln(k)\right|\sim n \ln(2n)+O(\ln(n))$$ In the same way we can estimate $$\left|\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1}(-1)^{k+1}k \ln(\ln(k))\right|= n\ln(\ln(2n))+O\left(\ln(\ln(n))\right)$$ and $$\left| \sum_{k=1}^{2n+1} (-1)^{k+1}k\right|=n+1$$ $$ \left|\sum_{k=1}^{2n+1}(-1)^{k+1}p_k\right|=n\Big( \ln(2n)+\ln(\ln(2n)-1\Big)+O\left(\frac{n \ln\ln(n)}{\ln(n)}\right) $$ or in other words $$ \left|\sum_{k=1}^{N}(-1)^{k+1}p_k\right|=\frac{N}{2}\Big( \ln(N)+\ln(\ln(N)-1\Big)+O\left(\frac{N \ln\ln(N)}{\ln(N)}\right) .$$ Basically this means that the absolute value of the sum oscillates around $\frac{P_N}{2}$ $$S(x)=\left|\sum_{k=1}^{x}(-1)^{k+1}p_k\right|-\frac{p_x}{2}$$ Therefore the function $S(x)$ will have no limit for $x \to\infty$ but will oscillate around the abscissa axis as if it were a sound wave. Who knows, maybe there is some way to code the $S$ function in some music software to know how the prime numbers sounds like.","['algebra-precalculus', 'asymptotics', 'summation', 'prime-numbers']"

4193264,"Evaluate Integral $ I:=\int_0^{2\pi} \cos s \,\log (\sqrt{c^2 + a - 2 \cos s}-c) \, \mathrm d s $ for radially magnetized cylinder","When trying to evaluate the magnetic scalar potential $\Phi_m$ of a magnetized cylinder (Magnetization $M$ in $x$ -direction, height $Z$ , Radius $R$ , touching the $xy$ -plane from below), I was able to solve two of the three integrals in cylinder coordinates, leaving one to give a completely closed form: $$\Phi_\mathrm m(\rho,\varphi,z) = \frac {M R} {4 \pi} \cos\varphi \left[\int_0^{2\pi} \cos \tilde \varphi \log \left( \sqrt{\zeta^2 + \rho^2 + R^2 - 2\rho R \cos\tilde \varphi}+\zeta  \right)\,\mathrm d \tilde\varphi\right]_{\zeta=z}^{\zeta=z+Z}   $$ Now I'm desprerately trying to solve the remaining integral, which can be written in the form $$ I:=\int_0^{2\pi} \cos s \,\log (\sqrt{c^2 + a - 2 \cos s}-c) \, \mathrm d s $$ for some numbers $ c:=\zeta /\sqrt{\rho R}\in\mathbb R $ and $ a:=\rho/R+R/\rho > 2 $ . Transforming this into a contour integral around the unit circle then reads $$ I= \oint_{\partial B_1(0)} (1+z^{-2})\log ( \sqrt {c^2 + a - (z+z^{-1})} - c) \, \mathrm d z  ,$$ but the various branch points for the square root and the log exceed my personal skills in arguing correctly about branch cuts and choosing a suitable integration contour. Maybe someone could tell, if there is any hope that this integral is solvable in closed form, or if one is stuck with numerical evaluations? Solutions involving special functions (elliptic integrals / Bessel functions / etc.) are definitely no problem. In my further attempts to aviod the difficulties with the complex $ \log $ function, there is yet another form (via substitutions), which might be solved by a suitable contour integration(?): $$ I = 2 \int_0^2 \frac {\sqrt{1-v^2} \,\mathrm d v}{(\sqrt{c^2+a-2v}-c) \sqrt {c^2+a-2v}}  $$","['integration', 'contour-integration', 'electromagnetism', 'definite-integrals']"
4193270,Proving there is no squared $n\times n$ (n odd) real matrix yielding minus the identity matrix,"Prove or give a counterexample There is no $A \in \Bbb R^{3 \times 3}$ such that $A^2 = -\Bbb I_3$ Here's my attempt I suspect that the statement is true. To prove it, I used contradiction Assuming $A^2 = -\Bbb I_3$ holds, we take the determinant on both sides to get $$ \det A^2= (\det A)^2= (-1)^3 \det(\Bbb I_3) \Rightarrow \det A = \sqrt{-1}$$ So the determinant of $A$ is ill-defined over the real numbers, which is a contradiction (as the determinant of square matrices is well-defined over the real numbers).
