1423762,Stiefel-Whitney class of homotopy equivalent manifolds,"Let $M$, $N$ be two manifolds without boundary (it is possible that $M$, $N$ have different dimensions, or one is compact but the other is not, etc.). Suppose $M\simeq N$ ($M$ is homotopy equivalent to $N$). Can we obtain that the Stiefel-Whitney class of $M$ and the Stiefel-Whitney class of $N$ are equal? My idea: From Wu's formula, the relations of Stiefel-Whitney class are given by Steenrod operations, which are invariant under homotopy equivalence.

1423794,Two conics from six Thebault circles of a triangle,"[Significant edits, context, etc, provided by Blue , based on comments from the original author.] While exploring Thebault circles in GeoGebra (see my interactive sketch ), I noticed some interesting (and new?) connections with conics. I pose my conjectures as problems (1) and (2) below. I'm an electrical engineer, not a mathematician. I don't know how to prove these results. Given concurrent cevians $\overleftrightarrow{AP}$, $\overleftrightarrow{BP}$, $\overleftrightarrow{CP}$ of $\triangle ABC$, consider the six Thebault circles (two per cevian) that these lines determine. Show that the centers of the Thebault circles lie on a conic. Each Thebault circle is, by definition, tangent to a side of the triangle (two circles per side). Show that the six points of tangency lie on a conic; further, show that the conic is a circle if $P$ is $\triangle ABC$'s orthocenter. In the above, point $I$ is $\triangle ABC$'s incenter, which is known to be collinear with each pair of Thebault centers. Cut-the-Knot demonstrates a construction of a Thebault circle using the incenter. [Images by Blue, too!] Blue remarks: I've been able to verify (2) via this Ceva -like condition for conic-making ... $$\frac{AF^\prime}{F^\prime B}\cdot

$$ After simplification , we get $$

1423864,Approximate zeros of a (hypothetical) analog of $\zeta(s)$,"[Added numbers 11/13.] Motivation (can skip). When prime powers $p_n$ are used to calculate $$y(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\sin (x \log p_n)}{p_n},\hspace{5mm}(1)$$ for (say) $N= 30,$ $x>5$ , at sign changes $(+/ -)$ $y(x)$ seems to give approximately the imaginary parts $\gamma_r$ of  a subset of zeros of $\zeta(s).$ The first few zero indices, with some ambiguity when zeros are tightly spaced, are $r =  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18,...$ It's a lacklustre approximation and I think this has been explained in other questions on this site. When the zeros (+/-) of (1) are used to form a well-known approximation of $$\sum x^{\rho}/\rho$$ which in pertinent part is $$\sum_r \frac{\sin (\gamma_r \log x)}{\gamma_r}\hspace{5mm}(2), $$ the resulting graph has discontinuities at the prime powers. If instead of primes (prime powers) we use non-prime powers $q_r$ in (1), we will also get a sequence of approximate ""zeros"" at sign changes (+/-). If we use them instead of $\gamma_r$ in the approximation(2), we might expect to see discontinuities at non-prime powers. This is apparently the case. Using 100 such ""zeros"" $\alpha_r$ the graph of $$\sum_r \frac{\sin (\alpha_r \log x)}{\alpha_r} $$ appears to show discontinuities at 1,6,10,12,14,15,... in the same way that (2) shows discontinuities at prime powers. Question. When non-prime powers $q_n$ are used to form $Y(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\sin (x \log q_n)}{q_n},$ the zeros $\alpha_r$ at sign changes (+/-), inserted in $G(x)=\sum_r \frac{\sin (\alpha_r \log x)}{\alpha_r},$ give discontinuities at approximately non-prime powers. What meaning, if any, can be attached to the zeros $\alpha_r$ of $Y(x)$ ? Are they a subset of the complex parts of the zeros of some cousin of $\zeta(s)$ ?

1423902,Strange definition of real differentiable function,"I am currently refreshing my complex analysis knowledge (I had a course many years ago, but I've forgotten almost all of it). The German textbook I'm using, which is Funktionentheorie by Fischer & Lieb, states the following definition of real differentiability A function $g:U\to\Bbb R$ is said to be real differentiable in the point $z_0=x_0+iy_0$ of the domain $U\subseteq\Bbb C$ if there exist real-valued functions $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ on $U$ which are continuous at $z_0$ such that for all $z=x+iy\in U$ we have
  $$
g(z) = g(z_0) + \Delta_1(z)(x-x_0) + \Delta_2(z)(y-y_0) \qquad\qquad (1)
$$ I found myself wondering how this is related to the usual definition of a partially differentiable function. If some function $g:U\to\Bbb R$ satisfies this condition, and we define $\Delta_1^{y_0}(x)=\Delta_1(x,y_0)$ and $\Delta_2^{x_0} = \Delta_2(x_0,-)$, then 
$$
g(x,y_0) = g(x_0,y_0) + \Delta_1^{y_0}(x)(x-x_0) \quad\text{and}\quad
g(x_0,y) = g(x_0,y_0) + \Delta_2^{x_0}(y)(y-y_0)
$$
so $\Delta_1^{y_0}(x_0) = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(z_0) = \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{g(x,y_0)-g(x_0,y_0)}{x-x_0}$ and $\Delta_2^{x_0}(z_0) = \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(z_0) = \lim_{y\to y_0}\frac{g(x_0,y)-g(x_0,y_0)}{y-y_0}$. So the partial derivatives exist. Moreover, $g$ is continuous at $z_0$. Now assume for the other direction that $g$ is continuous at $z_0$ and that $\Delta_1^{y_0}$ and $\Delta_2^{x_0}$ exist as above (so they are continuous at $x_0$ and $y_0$, respectively). I figured out that if we set
$$
\Delta_1(x,y) = \frac12\left(\Delta_1^{y_0}(x) + \frac{g(x,y)-g(x_0,y)}{x-x_0}\right) \\
\Delta_2(x,y) = \frac12\left(\Delta_2^{x_0}(y) + \frac{g(x,y)-g(x,y_0)}{y-y_0}\right)
$$
then this satisfies (1). Note that we let the right-hand summand in the first line assume the value $\Delta_1^{y_0}(x_0)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$, and an arbitrary value at any other $(x_0,y)$, and similarly for the summand in then second line. Now my problem: I have trouble showing that the right-hand summand in the first line is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$. Any ideas? Or maybe definition above is not equivalent to the existence of the partial derivatives? Is it even equivalent to anything else? Some words about the context: In the textbook, three pages later, it is shown that a function $f=g+ih:U\to\Bbb C$ is complex differentiable in $z_0$ if and only if $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline z}(z_0)=0$ and the functions $g$ and $h$ are real differentiable in the sense of (1).","['continuity', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'definition']"

1423914,Transitive group action,"I am just trying to learn what transitive group action is. It seems I understand the definition, but I still have an issue.

Direct implication of another definition I have (from the source I learn from) is that group action is transitive if for every $x \in X$ : $G\cdot x = X$ .
According to Wikipedia (and later on in my source), it seems to be enough only for one x to have $G\cdot x = X$ to deduce transitivity. In short, I don't see how $G\cdot x = X$ for one $x \in X \implies G\cdot x = X$ , for every $x \in X$ . P.S: I have yet to learn what orbit is.

All red = 3/8 . 2/7 . 1/6 then the probability of next black ball can be drawn is 1. And probability of each way is 1/4.

My reasoning is the following: If we think of $\gamma(s)$ as $\gamma(t(s))$, then deriving with respect to $s$ gives, by the chain rule: $$\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s)=\gamma'(t(s))t'(s)$$ $$\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s)=\gamma''(t(s))(t'(s))^2 + \gamma'(t(s))t''(s)$$ It follows that: $$\left (\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s) \right )\times \left (\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s) \right )=[\gamma'(t(s))\times \gamma''(t(s))](t'(s))^3$$ But we also have: $$\left \|  \left (\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s) \right )\times \left (\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s) \right ) \right \|=\left \|  \left (\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s) \right ) \right \| \left \|\left (\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s) \right ) \right \|\sin \left (   \left (\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s) \right ),\left (\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s) \right ) \right )$$ $$=\left \|\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\gamma(s) \right \|=\kappa (s)$$ Putting this all together, and using that $t'(s)=\frac{1}{|\gamma'(t(s))|}$ we get: $$\kappa(s)=\frac{\left \| \gamma'(t(s)) \times \gamma''(t(s))\right \|}{\left \| \gamma '(t(s))\right \|^3}$$ Not $t=t(s) \iff s=s(t)$, hence: $$\kappa(s(t))=\frac{\left \| \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)\right \|}{\left \| \gamma '(t)\right \|^3}$$ The right side of this last equation matches what I wanted to prove, but it should be just $t$ instead of $s(t)$ on the left side.

1424505,"If $G$ acts primitively and $\Gamma \subseteq \Omega$ is not a block, then each pair of points could be separated","Let $G$ act on $\Omega$. A subset $\Delta \subseteq \Omega$ is called a block if for each $x \in G$ either $\Delta^x \cap \Delta = \emptyset$ or $\Delta^x = \Delta$, where $\Delta^x := \{ \delta^x : \delta \in \Delta \}$. The singletons of $\Omega$ and $\Omega$ are the trivial blocks, a group acting on $\Omega$ is called primitive if it has no non-trivial blocks. Now let $G$ act primitively on $\Omega$. If $\Gamma \subseteq \Omega$ is not a block, and $\alpha, \beta \in \Omega$ are arbitrary, does there exists some $g \in G$ such that either
$$
 \alpha \in \Gamma^g \mbox{ and } \beta \notin \Gamma^g
$$
or
$$
 \alpha \notin \Gamma^g \mbox{ and } \beta \in \Gamma^g.
$$ My proof : We use the fact
$$
 G \mbox{ acts primitive on } \Omega
 \Leftrightarrow
 \mbox{ each point stabilizer is a maximal subgroup }.
$$
So let $G$ act primitively on $\Omega$ and let $\Delta \subseteq \Omega$ be a proper subset with at least two elements and $\alpha, \beta \in \Omega$ be distinct.
If exactly one of $\alpha$ or $\beta$ lies in $\Delta$, nothing has to be shown. 
Suppose $\{ \alpha, \beta \}\subseteq \Delta$ and consider
$$
 H = \langle \{ g \in G : \alpha \in \Delta^g \} \rangle.
$$
Then of course $G_{\alpha} \le H$ as $\alpha \in \Delta$. Now by primitivity we have $H = G_{\alpha}$ or $H = G$. If $H = G_{\alpha}$ then
$$
 \alpha^g = \alpha \Leftrightarrow \alpha \in \Delta^g.
$$
Now choose $x \in G$ with $\alpha^x = \beta$ (as primitive implies transitive this is possible), then $\beta \in \Delta^x$ but $\alpha \notin \Delta^x$ (for otherwise we would have $\alpha^x = \alpha$). Now with the case
$H = G$ I am stuck, any ideas how to proceed from here? The case $\alpha$ and $\beta$ both not in $\Delta$ could be reduced to the one above, for if $\gamma \in \Delta$ choose $x \in G$ with $\gamma^x = \alpha$, then $\alpha \in \Delta^x$, if $\beta \notin \Delta^x$ we are done, otherwise $\{\alpha,\beta\} \in \Delta^x$, apply the above reasoning to find some $g \in G$ such that $\Delta^{xg}$ contains exactly one of $\alpha$ or $\beta$. Remark 1 : The question comes from this question for transitive $G$, for which it is wrong. But for primitive $G$ it holds. Remark 2 : My proof attempt uses a connection between primitivity and point stabilizers, as this question comes from an (although wrongly stated, see this post ) exercise of Dixon & Mortimers book Permutation Groups , a solution without using this connection would be preferable, as in the book this is stated a few pages behind the exercise, and so maybe there is a solution without using it.

What I tried I first considered the series: $$F(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}F_{2n+1}x^{n}=\frac{1-x}{x^2-3x+1}$$ (when it converges). Then I replaced $x$ with $x^2$ and tried integrating to get something like: $$A(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}F_{2n+1} \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}=\int \frac{1-x^2}{x^4-3x^2+1}$$ This is where one question arises: Is this integration a valid thing to do? The sum on the left has a value, but the integral on the right has some constant added to it. In that case, how should I choose the constant? Now, making $x=\frac{1}{\phi^2}$ would make the $\phi^{4n+2}$ term appear, but we still need to put a $(-1)^n$ in there, so I thought of putting an $i$ there (because $i^{2n+1}=i \cdot (-1)^n$ ) this way: $x=\frac{i}{\phi^2}$ , and then $$A(x)=i \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n F_{2n+1}}{(2n+1) \phi^{4n+2}}.$$ So now I need to prove that the integral for this $x$ is exactly $\frac{i \pi}{4\sqrt{5}}$ , but the problem I have is that the integral has logarithms and I don’t know how to find logarithms of complex numbers like $\log(5+2i)$ . (I found on Wikipedia the Taylor series for logarithms, but I can’t see how this makes the problem simpler.) More questions Does it make sense to plug this complex value into the power series and the integral? If so, then how one would evaluate the integral for this specific $x=\frac{i}{\phi^2}$ ?

1424847,Is a proper morphism between quasiprojective varieties projective?,"I'm currently reading Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry 1 . In it (page 59), he makes the following definition: ...a wider class of maps $f: X \rightarrow Y$ between quasiprojective varieties, namely those that factor as a composite of a closed embedding $\iota: X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n \times Y$ and the projection $p:  \mathbb{P}^n \times Y \rightarrow Y$. Such maps are said to be proper . But this is the definition of a projective morphism! (In the sense of Hartshorne , not EGA). Is Shafarevich over-simplifying, using outdated terminology, or using a definition that's in fact equivalent in his context? In other words, is a proper morphism between quasiprojective varieties automatically projective? I'd like to say that it is, and I have the following germ (hehe) of a proof in my head: If $X \rightarrow Y$ is a proper morphism of quasiprojective varieties, then in particular it is universally closed, so the base change $\mathbb{P}^n \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n \times Y$ is a closed map. This should be enough, but I'm not sure how to finish (it has something to do with diagonals and graphs being closed which has something to do with separatedness, but this is a condition I've never been very comfortable using). I think a similar argument shows that a complete quasiprojective variety is projective, by taking a base change along $\mathbb{P}^n \rightarrow k$ and using something about the graph/diagonal being closed.

I have shown through some exhausting case analysis that the use of completing the square can show that these are the only irreducible quadratic varieties in characteristic $\neq 2$, but the text I'm working from seems to indicate that this isn't the case in characteristic $2$, as it asks if a proof of the fact can be valid in characteristic $2$ (which to me seems to indicate, in the way math problems do, that the answer is no). I would like a gentle hint towards finding such a variety if possible. A friend and I have considered $W = Z(x^2 + xy + y)$ but we don't have much technical machinery to show that $W \not \simeq X$ or $Y$. Does anyone have any ideas? Edit: Running with this variety for a moment, note that $(1,y)$ is never a point in $W$ as then $1 + y + y = 0 \rightarrow 1 + 2y = 0 \rightarrow 1 = 0$ as $K$ has characteristic $2$, and certainly this is a contradiction. So now suppose $x \neq 1$, then we may solve for $y$: $y = \dfrac{x^2}{x+1}$ so $W = \left\lbrace\left(x,\dfrac{x^2}{x+1}\right)\right\rbrace$.

1425095,What is wrong with ZFC?,"Why are there seemingly so many who want to use ETCS, or HoTT, or similar as a foundation of mathematics? I'm aware that HoTT has a good few good aspects, but that doesn't entirely explain the strong desire to find something other than ZFC to use, so I ask: What is actually wrong with ZFC that drives this desire? I've heard a few arguments already, though they were a bit vague - I'll list them below. As all the objects of ZFC are sets, in ZFC questions such as ""is $\pi \in 3$"" may be asked, and for some reason just the fact that that may be asked is a problem...but I can't really see the issue. You never need to ask those questions so where would they cause a problem? Another argument is that ZFC has too much ""baggage"" caused by the cumulative hierarchy - we don't want to have to worry about the set theoretical aspects of the elements of the real numbers, for example. This, again, is lost on me - can anyone give an example of where we ever actually feel the need to say anything at all about such aspects? Surely once you've got your definitions and you have a few properties that you want you can proceed to deduce using only those properties and may safely ignore those you don't want to think about? You'll never get a false theorem from ignoring an axiom - when one proves something about groups in general it does not matter what extraneous properties individual groups have, they follow the group axioms so the conclusion is valid. Similarly we know what properties we want the real numbers to have, so surely we can deduce from those without any real issue once we have an object with those (though possibly other) properties? The last apparent issue I'll mention is categories. Apparently ZFC (let's assume with Universes) is a headache for category theorists. Something about ZFC makes category theory harder than it would be in, say, homotopy type theoretic foundations. So far all I've seen is hand waving - can anyone give an example of where ZFC(+U) truly makes life so much more difficult for category theorists? What is the problem? I know that this is a negative post, asking what is wrong with ZFC rather than what is right about HoTT, ETCS, etc, it's just that I've seen many vague references from those disgruntled with the set theory, but not yet any concrete grievances.
