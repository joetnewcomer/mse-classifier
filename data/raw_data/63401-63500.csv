727055,Problem related to the exact distribution and the CLT,"I'm trying to solve a pretty straight forward problem but i can't find good info on the subjects necessary to solve it so i'm terribly stuck. I'll present it as follows and later try to explain my specific doubts about it. Here it goes: Let $X_{1}, \ldots , X_{15}$ be a simple sample from a  exponential population $X$ with mean $= 3$ and let $S = X_{1} + \cdots + X_{15}$. Find $P(S>38)$ using: The exact distribution of $S$ The normal approximation. In this case, explain why the of the central limit theorem is valid First :I can't find good information about the exact distribution, so i don't know where should I put the values from the problem, because I don't even know the pdf of the exact distribution Second I understand the intuition of the CLT in which  given a sufficiently large sample size from a population (with a finite level of variance), the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean. BUT i can't relate that to the problem, it simply doesn't make sense to me how one connects to another. I know about the normal distribution, but what's the meaning of a 'normal approximation' ?","['statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'descriptive-statistics']"

727076,Probability that random moves in the game 2048 will win,"I have recently played the game 2048 , created by Gabriele Cirulli, which is fun.  I suggest trying if you have not.  But my brother posed this question to me about the game: If he were to write a script that made random moves in the game 2048, what is the probability that it would win the game? Combinatorics is not my area, so I did not even attempt to answer this, knowing this seems like a difficult question to answer.  But I thought someone here might have a good idea. Also, since we are not concerned with time, just with winning, we can assume that every random move actually results in a tile moving. Addendum While the answers below shed light on the problem, only BoZenKhaa came close to providing a probability, even if it was an upper bound.  So I would like to modify the question to: Can we find decent upper and lower bounds for this probability?","['probability', 'popular-math', 'combinatorics']"

727274,"Finite dimensional subspace of $C([0,1])$","Let linear $S$ be a subspace of $C([0,1])$, i.e., the continuous real-valued
  functions on $[0,1]$. Assume that there exists $c>0$, such that
  $\|\,f\|_\infty\leq c \|\,f\|_2$, for all $f\in S$. Then show that $S$ is finite-dimensional. This is equivalent to proving that the closed unit ball in $(S,\|\|_\infty)$ or in $(S,\|\|_2)$ is compact, but I can't derive this. Another thought is that the $L^2$ closure of $S$ is a subset of $C([0,1])$. Indeed, if $f_n\to f\in L^2$, then the given relation $\|f_n-f\|_\infty \leq c\|f_n-f\|_2$ implies that $f_n\to f$ in $L^\infty$, so $f$ is continuous. Therefore we have the inclusion
$$S\subset \overline{S}^{L^2}\subset C([0,1])\subset L^2$$
If $S$ was infinite dimensional, then $\overline{S}$ would be an infinite dimensional hilbert space, proper subset of $L^2$. Another thought is that all the $L^p$ norms on $S$ are equivalent (by Holder).

Prove for which points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ this function is continuous or differentiable? So I know by a well-known theorem (and there is a higher-dimensional version) that if a function is NOT continuous at a point, then it is NOT differentiable there either. In this problem, it seems that it is nowhere continuous. The only place where it could possibly be continuous, I think, is at $x=(0,0,...,0)$. Because for any other $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ rational, any neighborhood will contain irrationals whose image is $0$ which means we can't find a neighborhood small enough such that $x,y\in N_\delta(x)\implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$. If I can prove it is continuous at 0 (and nowhere else), is it differentiable there also? Does this follow from the fact that $|x|^2$ is differentiable on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$?

If $\Omega$ is a polygon, has piecewise $C^1$ boundary (so edges and corneres are not to wild) or is a convex set this still seems to be possible.

727958,Showing the exponential and logarithmic functions are unique in satisfying their properties,"The question asks to prove that there exists a unique function defined on $\Bbb R$ and satisfying the following conditions: 1) $f(1) = a$ $(a>0, a \neq 0)$ 2) $f(x_1) \cdot f(x_2) = f(x_1 + x_2)$ 3) $f(x) \rightarrow f(x_0)$ as $x \rightarrow x_0 $ Since the text goes into detail constructing the exponential function and proving these properties, I assume I only have to show uniqueness. i.e. showing that if functions $f$ and $g$ satisfy these properties, then $f=g$. $f(1) = g(1)$ by property (1). Then for $n\in \Bbb N$, $(f-g)(n)$ $=$$f(n) - g(n)$ $= f(1)^n -g(1)^n $ by property (2) and induction. But $f(1) = g(1) = a > 0$  , which implies $f(1)^n -g(1)^n = 0$ and hence $f(n) =g(n)$ We have $f(1)-g(1)$ $=$  $f(\frac1n \cdot n) -g(\frac1n \cdot n)$ $=$$f(\frac1n)^n-g(\frac1n)^n   = 0$. Now $f(x) = f(\frac x2)^2 \ge 0$, so $f(\frac1n) =g(\frac1n)$. $f(\frac mn ) -g (\frac mn ) $  $=$ $f(\frac1n)^m - g(\frac1n)^m$ which implies that $f(\frac mn) - g(\frac mn)$ $=0$. For $x \in \Bbb R$, $\lim \limits_{\Bbb Q \in r \to x}$ $(f-g)(r) =0$: for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can choose a $\delta > 0$ such that $|r - x| < \delta $ and $|f(r) - g(r)| = 0 < \epsilon $. By property 3 we also have $\lim \limits_{\Bbb Q \in r \to x}(f-g)(r) =\lim \limits_{\Bbb Q \in r \to x} f(r) - \lim \limits_{\Bbb Q \in r \to x} g(r) = f(x) - g(x)$.

728001,Projecting an affine hypersurface away from a point in its projective closure is never a finite map?,"Let $X\subset \mathbb{A}_k^r$ be an irreducible hypersurface defined by a polynomial $g$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field. Embed $\mathbb{A}^r\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^r$ in the usual way. Consider the stereographic projection of $X$ from a point $p$ in $\overline{X}\setminus X$ to some hyperplane not containing $p$, where $\overline{X}$ is $X$'s projective closure. I want to show that this projection is never a finite map from $X$ to this hyperplane.  (This comes from an exercise in Shafarevich, specif. section 1.5 exercise 8 in Basic Algebraic Geometry 1 .) ( Aside: Actually the desired result is false! See Addendum below for revised question.) I have reduced the problem to the following algebraic one, but haven't seen how to complete the proof in these terms. My ideal answer would show me how to fill in the needed steps in this algebraic situation, but I would also be interested to hear more geometric arguments as well. Algebraic reformulation: Let $g$ be an irreducible polynomial in $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$. Let $L_1,\dots,L_{r-1}$ be $r-1$ linear functions on $\mathbb{A}^r$, and let each $L_j = \ell_j +\alpha_j$ where each $\ell_j$ is a linear form and each $\alpha_j\in k$. Suppose the $\ell_j$'s are linearly independent. Let $g_m$ be $g$'s maximum-degree homogeneous component, and suppose we are given that $g_m$ vanishes on the common zero set of $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_{r-1}$. Prove that in this case, $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is not finite over the subring generated by the $L_j$'s. Explanation of algebraic reformulation: The $L_j$'s are the restrictions to $\mathbb{A}^r$ of linear forms $L_j'$ on $\mathbb{P}^r$ that, together with $x_0=0$, cut out the point $p$ that is the center of the stereographic projection. Then the projection is, for suitable parametrization of the hyperplane being projected into, given by $(x_0:x_1:\dots:x_r)\mapsto (x_0:L_1':\dots:L_{r-1}')$; so its restriction to $\mathbb{A}^r$ is given by $(x_1,\dots,x_r)\mapsto (L_1,\dots,L_{r-1})$. The fact that $p$ is in $X$'s projective closure is expressed by the condition that when $x_0=0$ and all the $L_j'$'s are zero too, then $g$'s homogenization is zero. This translates into the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when all the $\ell_j$'s vanish. The question of whether the map is finite is then the question of whether $X$'s coordinate ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$ is finite over the pullback image of $k[y_1,\dots,y_{r-1}]$ (the coordinate ring of the hyperplane), which is the subalgebra generated by the $L_j$'s. Work so far: By the Nullstellensatz, the condition that $g_m$ vanishes when the $\ell_j$'s vanish amounts to saying that $g_m$ is in the radical of the ideal generated by the $\ell_j$'s; call it $L$. It seems to me that this ideal is already radical, since the $\ell_j$'s are homogeneous of degree $1$, though I'm not sure of this. Then $g_m$ is actually in $L$. Also, not every $x_i$ can be in $L$ because since it is a homogeneous ideal, an $x_i$ could only be in $L$ if it is a linear combination of the $\ell_j$'s, but there are only $r-1$ of them and $r$ $x_i$'s, so they cannot span the $k$-vector space containing the $x_i$'s. So, consider an $x_i$ that is not in $L$. If $k[X]$ were finite over the subalgebra generated by the $L$'s, there would be an integral equation for $x_i$ over this subalgebra, occurring in $k[X] = k[x_1,\dots,x_r]/(g)$: $$x_i^s + \sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(L_1,\dots,L_{r-1}) x_i^j = 0$$ Lifting this to an equation in $k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$, and noting that polynomials in the $L_j$'s are equally well polynomials in the $\ell_j$'s (and changing the $F_j$'s accordingly), yields: $$x_i^s + \sum_{j=0}^{s-1} F_j(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_{r-1}) x_i^j = Hg$$ for some $H\in k[x_1,\dots,x_r]$. If I could rig the left side to guarantee that the highest-degree homogeneous component is degree $s$, then this would yield a contradiction: reducing mod $L$ would reduce the degree of the right side but not the left, since $x_i^s\notin L$ (if I am right that $L$ is radical). But this is where I am stuck. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. Addendum, 3/27: It seems that the result is false! user119882 gives more or less the easiest possible counterexample: $r=2$, $L_1=x$, $g=y+x^2$. Clearly $k[x,y]/(y+x^2)$ is finite over the subring $k[L_1] = k[x]$. This is also a counterexample to the original geometric statement: we have a plane conic tangent to the line at infinity; the stereographic projection away from this point of tangency is a finite map (actually an isomorphism) to $\mathbb{A}^1$. Unless I am very very confused, I lifted this statement directly from Shafarevich. The following is on p. 66 of the paperback second edition: Let $X\subset\mathbb{A}^r$ be a hypersurface of $\mathbb{A}^r$ and $L$ a line of $\mathbb{A}^r$ through the origin. Let $\varphi_L$ be the map projecting $X$ parallel to $L$ to an $(r-1)$-dimensional subspace not containing $L$. Write $S$ for the set of all lines $L$ such that $\varphi_L$ is not finite. Prove that $S$ is an algebraic variety. [Hint: Prove that $S = \overline{X}\cap \mathbb{P}^{r-1}_\infty$.] So the parenthetical hint must be wrong! $S$ is a subset of $\overline{X}\cap\mathbb{P}^{r-1}_\infty$ but not necessarily the whole thing! Revised question: What is the condition (either geometric or algebraic) on the point $p$ of $\overline{X}\setminus X$ such that stereographic projection from this point is not a finite map on $X$?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'graded-rings', 'polynomials']"

728040,Placing n points in a MxM square grid,"I am facing an apparently well-known problem: placing $n$ points in a discrete grid so that the points are 'evenly' distributed. By evenly I mean that I would like the density of points to be nearly constant throughout the grid (avoid points concentrating in certain regions as much as possible). This problem seems to be quite tough (I am not a mathematician so I did not know that beforehand :). I found this paper that seemed to address a similar problem, and there they mention that a good strategy if you have a grid that is $2^k \times 2^k$ (which I can make because my grid is arbitrary) is to pick the largest empty circle and place the point at its center. So my questions are: Is that so? If it is, how do I guarantee that if I get several largest circles I don't accumulate the points as I am placing the points online? What is a good way to implement that? I am looking at matlab but it does not seem obvious to me how to compute the largest available circle every time (I would have to sweep all the available points for placement and compute this, which will take long time). But again I am not a computer science guy either. Any hint / help would be appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: to be more specific based on the comments so far, I should say that I have tried a couple of things:
1) a code I found in http://www.softimageblog.com/archives/115 posted by Anton Sherwood, which uses two relatively prime numbers to generate a pattern. This can create adequate patterns for certain combinations in R^2 but when I round the result it groups the points. I though this approach was the Halton sequences because of the prime numbers but I am not sure now.
2) I used a true Halton sequence following one of the comments, but this gave a somewhat random distribution (which is what it is supposed to do) My problem is deterministic, as I know my grid (actually I can chose it arbitrarily with some constraints) and I also know the number of points I want to place inside, so I was more looking for a deterministic approach to place the points to achieve even distribution (as in the paper I first mentioned).

In order to get from $x$ to the boundary $\partial U$, $B(t)$ must first pass through $\partial B_x(\delta)$. I'd like to know how this can be proved rigorously. This is the gist of the problem. More exactly, following is a theorem from chapter 3, ""Harmonic functions, transience and recurrence"" of Mörters and Peres's textbook Brownian Motion (to be referred to below as [M]). The theorem is listed below together with the proof given in the textbook (but not verbatim). I'm interested in a rigorous justification for the last couple of equations in the end of the proof, namely
$$
\begin{aligned}
E_x\left[E_x\left[\varphi(B(\tau))\mathbb{1}_{\{\tau < \infty\}} \mid \mathcal{F}^+(\rho)\right]\right] & = E_x\left[u(B(\rho))\right] \\
& = \int_{\partial B_x(\delta)} u(y) \mu_{x,\delta}(dy)
\end{aligned}
$$ Setting the stage Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_1$. Denote by $\mathbf{C}$ the set consisting of
   all continuous functions from $[0,\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. For
   every $t \in [0,\infty)$, denote by $\pi_t : \mathbf{C} \rightarrow
 \mathbb{R}^n$ the projection on the $t$th coordinate and denote by
   $\mathcal{B}$ the minimal $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbf{C}$ in which
   all the $\pi_t$'s are measurable. For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
   denote by $P_x$ the probability measure over the measurable space
   $(\Omega := \mathbf{C}, \mathcal{F} := \mathcal{B})$ that renders the
   stochastic process $(\pi_t)_{t \geq 0}$ a Brownian motion with start
   at $x$. For every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and every
   $\mathcal{B}/\textrm{Borel}$-measurable function $\varphi: \mathbf{C}
 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, denote by $E_x(\varphi)$ the expectation of
   $\varphi$ with respect to the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},
 P_x)$, provided this expectation exists (we allow the possibility that
   $E_x(\varphi) \in \{\pm \infty\}$). The Theorem ([M] Theorem 3.8, p. 68) Suppose $U$ is a non-empty, open, connected set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and
   define $\tau$ to be the first hitting time of $U$'s boundary, i.e. $$
 \tau := \inf \{t \geq 0 \mid : B(t) \in \partial U\} $$ Let $\varphi: \partial U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be measurable w.r.t.
   the $\sigma$-algebra induced on $\partial U$ by
   $\textrm{Borel}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and suppose the function $u: U
 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, defined by $$ u(x) := E_x[\varphi(B(\tau))
 \mathbb{1}_{\{\tau < \infty\}}] $$ for every $x \in U$, is locally
   bounded, i.e. for every $x \in U$ there is some neighborhood $N$ of
   $x$ such that $N \subseteq U$ and $u$ is bounded on $N$. In
   particular, we suppose that the expectation on the right is
   well-defined for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then $u$ is a harmonic function. Proof ([M] Proof of theorem 3.8, p. 68) We start with a lemma. Lemma ([M] Theorem 3.2, p. 65) Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a non-empty, open and connected set and let $v : D \rightarrow
 \mathbb{R}$ be a locally bounded function. Then $v$ is harmonic on $D$
     iff $v$ has the (spherical) mean value property: For all $z \in D$ and
     $s \in (0,\infty)$ such that the closed ball $\overline{B_z(s)}
 \subseteq D$, we have: $v$ is integrable on $\partial B_z(s)$ and $$
 v(z) = \int_{\partial B_z(s)} v(w) \mu_{z, s}(dw) $$ where $\mu_{z,
 s}$ is the normalized uniform measure on the sphere $\partial B_z(s)$. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\delta \in (0,\infty)$ be such that
   the closed ball $\overline{B_x(r)} := \{y \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid: |y -
 x| \leq r\}$ is contained in $U$. Define the stopping time $\rho :=
 \inf \{t \in (0,\infty) \mid: B(t) \neq B_x(\delta)\}$. Then the
   strong Markov property implies that
   $$ \begin{aligned} u(x) & =
  E_x\left[E_x\left[\varphi(B(\tau))\mathbb{1}_{\{\tau < \infty\}} \mid \mathcal{F}^+(\rho)\right]\right] \\

728851,Good confusion-avoiding notation for gluing toric varieties from fans?,"$
\newcommand\R{\mathbb R}
\newcommand\C{\mathbb C}
\DeclareMathOperator\Cone{Cone}
$I'm trying to establish a good notation to avoid confusion when we glue toric varieties from affine pieces. A simple example would be the toric variety given by the fan $\Sigma=\{\tau,\sigma_1,\sigma_2\}$ in $\mathbb R$ with cones
$$
\tau = \{0\},\quad \sigma_1=\Cone(1)=\R_{\ge 0},\quad \sigma_2=\Cone(-1)=\R_{\le 0}.
$$
The semigroup algebras of $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$ are
$$
\C[S_{\sigma_1}] = \C[\chi^1],\quad\C[S_{\sigma_2}]=\C[\chi^{-1}].
$$
To avoid confusion I introduce new independent variables $x_1, x_2$ and introduce isomorphism
$$
\C[S_{\sigma_1}] = \C[\chi^1]\cong \C[x_1],\quad\C[S_{\sigma_2}]=\C[\chi^{-1}] \cong \C[x_2].
$$
The affine pieces are $U_{\sigma_1},U_{\sigma_2}\cong\C$ glued along $U_\tau\cong\C^*$. I'd like to say that one copy of $\C$ is parametrized by the variable $x_1$, the other by the variable $x_2$ and we need to glue along $x_1\sim (x_2)^{-1}$ since under the introduced isomorphisms we have $\chi^1 = (\chi^{-1})^{-1}$. In the end I'd end up with something like
$$
X_\Sigma = \left( \C_{x_1} \sqcup \C_{x_2} \right)\big/ \left( x_1\sim (x_2)^{-1}\right)_{x_1,x_2\neq 0},
$$
where $\C_{x_1}$, $\C_{x_2}$ is supposed to suggest we denote the elements of the two copies $x_1$, $x_2$, respectively. Then we can see that this is exactly how the charts $\{(x_1:1)\},\{(1:x_2)\}\subseteq\C\mathbb P^1$ are glued, so $X_\Sigma=\C\mathbb P^1$. Is this a good way to deal with gluing toric varieties? I don't want to involve many homomorphisms formally so I'm looking for a good way and notation to get this message through without too much technicalities but still leave no confusion to what is happening. In the literature most authors don't bother to introduce seperate variables for each affine piece and just say the gluing is given by the embeddings of the $\C$-algebras, which I don't think is fair for people just starting with these kind of constructions. That's why I'm looking for a practical way to make the gluing process transparent.","['notation', 'toric-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question']"

I do understand that setting $\varrho(x,\Theta):=-\log p_\Theta(x)$ will yield the MLE as a special case of the MCE. But why does the so definied function $\varrho$ satisfy condition (1)? My attempt. Writing out condition (1) for this choice of $\varrho$ yields $$\int -\log( p_\Theta(x)) p_{\Theta_0}(x) dx > \int -\log( p_{\Theta_0}(x)) p_{\Theta_0}(x) dx $$ which is equivalent to $$ \int \log\left(\frac{p_{\Theta_0}(x)}{p_\Theta(x)}\right) p_{\Theta_0}(x)dx > 0$$ meaning $$E\left[ \log\left(\frac{p_{\Theta_0}(X)}{p_\Theta(X)}\right)  \right] > 0.$$ I just don't know why this should be the case.

Let $d$ denote the usual metric on $\mathbb{R},$ and take $d'(x,y) = \min\{d(x,y),1\}.$ Then $d'$ induces the same topology as $d$, but every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded with respect to $d'$. Question. Suppose two metrics induce the same bornology. Do they necessarily induce the same topological space?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
730294,Expected number of triangles in a random graph of size $n$,"Consider the set $V = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and let $p$ be a real number with 
$0<p<1$. We construct a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$, whose 
edge set $E$ is determined by the following random process: 
Each unordered pair $\{i,j\}$ of vertices, where $i \neq j$, occurs as 
an edge in $E$ with probability $p$, independently of the other 
unordered pairs. A triangle in $G$ is an unordered triple $\{i,j,k\}$ of distinct 
vertices, such that $\{i,j\}$, $\{j,k\}$, and $\{k,i\}$ are edges in $G$. Define the random variable $X$ to be the total number of 
triangles in the graph $G$. Determine the expected value $E(X)$.","['random-graphs', 'probability', 'expectation']"
730411,Behavior of $f'(x)$ as $x \to \infty$ given the behavior of $f(x)$ and $f''(x)$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : If $f(x)\to 0$ as $x\to\infty$ and $f''$ is bounded, show that $f'(x)\to0$ as $x\to\infty$ (4 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Suppose $f$ is twice differentiable on $(a, \infty)$ and let $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = 0$. Also assume that $f''(x)$ is bounded for all $x \in (a, \infty)$. Prove that $f'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. Note that if $f'(x)$ tends to a limit as $x \to \infty$ then this limit must be $0$ (because of the relation $f(x) - f(x/2) = (x/2)f'(c)$). What we need to establish now is that $f'(x)$ does tend to a limit. To show that we need to somehow use the fact that $f''(x)$ is bounded. Let $b > 0$ be any arbitrary but fixed number then we have relation $f(x + b) - f(x) = bf'(c)$ and this again implies that for all sufficiently large $x$ the derivative $f'$ takes a small value in the interval $(x, x + b)$. What we need to show that eventually all the values of $f'$ are small in such intervals. Now we can take $b$ as small as we please, we can therefore find a value $N > 0$  such that $f'$ takes very small value for at least one point in $(x, x + b)$ for all $x  > N$. If $p, q$ are two points of this interval $(x, x + b)$ then $|f'(p) - f'(q)| = |(p - q)f''(\xi)| \leq b|f''(\xi)|$ and since $f''$ is bounded it follows that $f'(p) - f'(q)$ is small so that effectively all values of $f'$ in $(x, x + b)$ are small. The above is a non-rigorous argument which I have not been able to make rigorous by using $\epsilon, \delta$ in proper manner. Maybe the approach used above can't be made rigorous and I am wrong path (or may be not!). Please help me in making above approach rigorous or suggest some alternative method. Further there is another generalization available: If $f(x) $ tends to a finite limit as $x \to \infty$ and $f^{(n + 1)}(x)$ is bounded then show that $f^{(n)}(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. I have not tried to solve this general problem and any hint would be great.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"
730421,Is $AA^T$ a positive-definite symmetric matrix?,Let $A\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ be a matrix. Is it true that $AA^{T}$ is positive-definite? Clearly $AA^{T}$ is symmetric. I have shown that a symmetric matrix $S\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ is positive-definite if and only if $S$ has only positive eigenvalues. Can this be helpful?,"['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
730449,Solved Problems in Algebraic Number Theory,"I'm not too sure whether this is the right place to ask this (and please correct me if it is not), but I'm currently studying a course in Algebraic Number Theory and would like to be pointed in the direction of any solved problems that can assist in learning. I have the book Problems in Algebraic Number Theory by Murty and Esmonde, which is particularly good, but are there any further sources (inc. online) available that do a similar job? It is so often frustrating to be presented with an extensive list of practice questions, many of which form part of the exposition of the material (as in Number Fields by Marcus for example) and then to have no real way of knowing whether any solution you generate is correct and has not made any oversights. MSE is undoubtedly a good place to verify any answers and clear up issues, but question limits and the impracticality of going online every time a solution seems suspect (or the question is computational and lacks any result to check against) form a barrier. I suppose any ANT textbook that has an accompanying solutions manual or online published solutions is what I have in mind. Or failing that, links to institutions running a course in ANT with answers to homework exercises. Thanks in advance.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'soft-question', 'number-theory']"
