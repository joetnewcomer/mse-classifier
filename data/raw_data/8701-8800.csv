65766,Definition of tangent space,"Terry Tao defines tangent space here as equivalence classes of continuously differentiable curves $\gamma : I \rightarrow G$ where $I$ is an open interval. On the other hand, Wikipedia defines it as equivalence classes of curves $\gamma : (-1,1) \rightarrow M$. I have 2 questions regarding this definition: (i) Why does it have to be functions from open sets? Why can it not be paths $\gamma : [0,1] \rightarrow G$? (ii) Are these definitions really equivalent? The context in which I am asking this is Lie groups and Lie algebras which I just started to read about.

65781,"Check whether two subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ are conjugate","Suppose I have two finite subgroups of $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$. Is there an algorithm
to find out whether these two belong to the same conjugacy class in
$GL(n,\mathbb Z)$? I tried by using the Jordan normal form: S1 and S2 belong to
the same conjugacy class in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ when we find a $Q_1 \in S_1$ and $Q_2 \in S_2$ for which $\quad 1.$ their Jordan normal forms are the same (i.e. they conjugate) $\quad \quad J_2 = J_1$ $\quad \quad \Leftrightarrow V_2^{-1}.Q_2.V_2 = V_1^{-1}.Q_1.V_1$ $\quad \quad \Leftrightarrow Q_2 = V_2.V_1^{-1}.Q_1.V_1.V_2^{-1} $ $\quad \quad \Leftrightarrow Q_2 = R^{-1}.Q_1.R\quad\quad  with\quad   R = V_1.V_2^{-1}$ $\quad 2.$ $R\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ $\quad 3.$ $S_2 = R^{-1}.S_1.R$ The problem is that the algorithm to calculate the Jordan normal form
is not very stable. Secondly, R given by the algorithm is not always
in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$. For example: $S_1=\lbrace id,Q_1\rbrace$ $Q1= \left[\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & -1 & 0\\
        -1  & 0 & 0\\
         0 &  0 & -1\end{array}\right]$ $S_2=\lbrace id,Q_2\rbrace$ $Q_2= \left[\begin{array}{rrr} -1 & 0 & 0\\
        0  & 0 & 1\\
         0 &  1 & 0\end{array}\right]$ Through the jordan normal form, the conjugacy matrix is found $R= \left[\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & 0.5 & 0.5\\
        1  & -0.5 & -0.5\\
         0 &  0.5 & -0.5\end{array}\right]$ so that $S_2 = R^{-1}.S_1.R\quad$   However, R is not in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ but we can find an R' in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ for which $S_2 = R'^{-1}.S_1.R'$ $R'= \left[\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & 1 & 0\\
        0  & 0 & -1\\
         1 &  0 & 0\end{array}\right]$ Any idea on how to solve this problem, preferably without using the

65783,Showing equality of sets using logical equivalance,"I'm just getting started with sentential logic and set theory in Discrete Math.

He asks to show that $\alpha (x) = 4x^2 - 3x^7$ is a permutation of the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{11} = \mathbb{Z} / 11\mathbb{Z}$. I can show this by brute force calculation, but I feel there must be some more elegant way to show this. I looked at the Wikipedia page on permutation polynomials , which, based on a quick perusal, seemed to suggest that it is not an easy question when the degree of the polynomial is greater than 2. It also mentioned the Dickson polynomials, but unless I am missing something, the polynomial in the question isn't a Dickson polynomial. I understand that there might not be a general method for this type of question, but even if someone can help me understand this particular example better, I would appreciate it. In particular, what I'd like to know is: is there a nice way to build a permutation polynomial given some quotient of $\mathbb{Z}$ to be permuted? can we say something about the inverse of the polynomial -- is it also a polynomial? How is it related to the initial polynomial? is there some faster way than plugging in to see that this polynomial must act as a permutation on $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$? what other sets $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ will be permuted by this polynomial?

65859,Greatest lower bound property and least upper bound property,"A Completeness principle in mathematical analysis is a principle by the help of which we can establish (prove) the completeness of an ordered field( About whom I am going to post one question later). (If I am wrong in defining then It will make me immensely happy if someone corrects it). Cauchy's completeness principle, Dedekind's principle, Cantor's principle, Weierstrass's principle, greatest lower bound principle  and least upper bound principle  are the completeness principles we come across in analysis. We can take anyone of this as an axiom and derive the remaining. Now let us consider proving the Least upper bound principle  taking the greatest lower bound principle as an axiom. My proof goes in the following way. Let us consider an ordered field $F$. Now taking the glbp as an axiom I can say that any non empty subset, $P$, of this ordered field definitely posses an element $k$  ($k$ belongs to $P$) such that all the elements of $P$ are greater than or equal to $k$. Any element  of the field less than $k$ serves as a lower bound for $P$. Now let us consider the set   $V = \{ -x\mid x\text{ belongs to }P\}$. Now $-k$ serves the least upper bound  for $V$. By GLBP axiom there exists a greatest lower bound for $V$ as $V$ is also a non empty subset of $F$. By similar arguments I can assert $P$ also has a least upper bound (which is the negative of the GLB of $V$}. Hence for every non empty subset of $F$ , there exists a least upper bound. In this way I obtained LUB property from GLB property. But, I have not yet found any analysis book which carries on this task along this lines.

65923,How does one compute the sign of a permutation?,"The sign of a permutation $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_n$, written ${\rm sgn}(\sigma)$, is defined to be +1 if the permutation is even and -1 if it is odd, and is given by the formula $${\rm sgn}(\sigma) = (-1)^m$$ where $m$ is the number of transpositions in the permutation when written as a product of transpositions. Alternatively the sign is -1 if, when we express $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles, the result contains an odd number of even-length cycles. Otherwise the sign is +1. My permutations are expressed as tuples $(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n)$, so neither the expression of the tuple as a product of disjoint cycles nor as a product of transpositions are immediately available to me. This suggests two high-algorithms to compute the sign of a permutation: Express the permutation as a product of transpositions and count the number of transpositions. Express the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles and count the number of even-length cycles. What are typical algorithms for accomplishing these tasks, and how do they vary in running type depending on $n$? Are there more efficient algorithms for calculating the sign of a permutation? Additional info The motivation is to quickly decide whether instances of the fifteen puzzle are solvable. I want to generate a large number of solvable instances of the fifteen puzzle for testing some search algorithms. At the moment I generate a random instance, and test whether it is solvable by trying to solve it with depth-first search, which is fairly slow going, and won't generalize well to larger puzzles (24 puzzle, 35 puzzle...) due to time and memory limitations. Since solvable instances of the fifteen puzzle are in 1-1 correspondence with even elements of $\mathfrak{S}_{16}$, I figure that there must be a faster way of generating solvable instances. It has just occurred to me that a better way of generating solvable instances of the puzzle might be to generate an even number of transpositions and multiply them together to generate an even permutation. I'd prefer an algorithm that was guaranteed to return an even distribution over $\mathfrak{S}_n$ though, and in fact I'm now sufficiently interested in the answer to this question in its own right.","['permutations', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'algorithms']"

65975,"A multinomial problem (balls, bins, etc.)","Consider the well known multinomial setting: there are L balls, thrown at random at n bins so that the probability that a ball falls in bin i is $p_i$, independent of the other balls (the $p_i$’s are all positive and sum to 1). Let $X_i$ be the number of balls in the ith bin.  It is straightforward to show that for any k distinct indices $i_1, i_2,\ldots, i_k$, the events $\lbrace X_{i_1} > 0\rbrace, \lbrace X_{i_2} > 0\rbrace,\ldots, \lbrace X_{i_k} > 0\rbrace$ are negatively dependent in the sense that $P(X_{i_1} > 0, X_{i_2} > 0,\ldots, X_{i_k} > 0) < P(X_{i_1} > 0)P(X_{i_2} > 0)\ldots P(X_{i_k} > 0)$ The proof is by induction over k: for k = 2, the probability on the LHS is $1 – [(1 - p_{i_1})^L + (1 - p_{i_2})^L - (1 - p_{i_1} - p_{i_2})^L]$, and on the RHS it’s $[1 - (1 – p_{i_1})^L] [1 - (1 – p_{i_2})^L]$.  Elementary manipulations show that the inequality holds, and the induction step is easily proven using the multiplication rule $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B | A)$. This negative dependence is also intuitively clear: if we know that there is at least one ball in bin i, there is at least one ball that will surely not fall into bin j, so the probability of bin j being non-empty decreases. So that was easy.  However, for proving a certain bound in my research, I need to do something similar, but for random k indices: suppose that after the balls were thrown into the bins, somebody comes and chooses randomly k distinct bins (so that each set of k bins has the same probability to be chosen, namely, 1/(n choose k)).  Let $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$ be the chosen indices, and again, I need to show that the inequality (below the second paragraph above) holds.

65990,Hankel function in terms of planewaves,"It is well know that planewaves are a complete basis for solutions to the wave equation. Let us assume a 2D space, and at fixed temporal frequency, the equation reduces to the Helmholtz equation. In cylindrical coordinates, the most appropriate solutions are the two kinds of Hankel functions, representing outgoing and incoming wave solutions. Actually, the Hankel functions should be multiplied by $e^{i m \theta}$ to produce cylindrical harmonics, which are a complete basis. My question is this: If cylindrical harmonics are a complete basis, is there a closed form expression relating them to planewaves? I know that 1st kind Bessel functions $J_m$ have a planewave decomposition by way of the Jacobi-Anger identity. However, a Hankel function's real part is a bessel function while its imaginary part is a 2nd kind Bessel function (Neumann function) with a singularity at the origin.

66014,Why probability measures in ergodic theory?,"I just had a look at Walters' introductory book on ergodic theory and was struck that the book always sticks to probability measures. Why is it the case that ergodic theory mainly considers probability measures? Is it that the important theorems, for example Birkhoff's ergodic theorem, is true only for probability measures? Or is it because of the relation with concepts from thermodynamics such as entropy? I also wish to ask one more doubt; this one slightly more technical. Probability theory always works with the Borel sigma algebra; it is rarely the case that the sigma algebra is enlarged to the Lebesgue sigma algebra for the case of the real numbers(for defining random variables) or the unit circle, for instance. In ergodic theory, do we go by this restriction, or not? That is, when ignoring sets of measure zero, do we have that subsets of measure zero are measurable?","['probability-theory', 'ergodic-theory']"

Well, am just returning to math after a long time of little practice, so I could be wrong.

66291,Simple integration by parts problem?,"An integration reduction formula for $\sec^n x$ is $$\int\sec^nx\;dx=\frac{1}{n-1}\sec^{n-2}x\tan x+\frac{n-2}{n-1}\int\sec^{n-2}x\;dx, n≠1$$ Using this formula (which I am sure is correct) gives the integral of $16\sec^3x$ to be $$16\int \sec^3 x\;dx=16\left(\frac{1}{2}\sec x\tan x-\frac{1}{2}\int\sec x\;dx\right)=8\sec x\tan x-8\ln|\tan x+\sec x|+C$$ Now, if I don't use this reduction formula, and instead opt to do it using the same method used to generalize the formula in the first place (integration by parts) I should get the same answer. But I don't! Aha! There lies my dilemma. Watch: Letting $u=\sec x$ and $dv=\sec^2x$, then $du=\tan x\sec x$ and $v=\tan x$ and we get $$\int{\sec^3xdx}=\sec x\tan x-\int\sec x\tan^2x\;dx$$ Using the Pythagorean trigonometric identity $\tan^2x=\sec^2x-1$ $$\int\sec^3x\;dx =\sec x\tan x-\int \sec x(\sec^2x-1)\;dx =\sec x\tan x-\int\sec^3x-\sec x\;dx$$ And so, using the integral used earlier, we get $$16\int\sec^3x\;dx=16(\sec x\tan x-\int \sec^3x\;dx +\ln|\tan x+\sec x|)$$ However, if I was to multiply the $16$ on the RHS ""in"" and then absorb the integral on the LHS and divide, I would end up with $$\int\sec^3x \;dx=\frac{1}{2}\sec x\tan x+\frac{1}{2}\ln|\tan x+\sec x|+C$$ which isn't the same answer I arrived at earlier.

66375,Extending open maps to Stone-Čech compactifications,"Let $X$ be a Čech-complete space, and $Y$ a paracompact space. Suppose $f\colon X\to Y$ is a continuous and open surjection. Since $Y$ is completely regular we have that $\beta(Y)$ is homeomorphic to $Y$ as a dense subset of $\beta Y$ (the Stone-Čech compactification). We can, if so, take $\hat f\colon X\to\beta Y$ defined as $\beta\circ f$, as a continuous function from $X$ into a compact Hausdorff space. By the universal property of $\beta X$ we can uniquely extend $\hat f$ to a  continuous $\tilde f\colon\beta X\to\beta Y$ such that $\tilde f|_{\beta(X)} = \hat f\circ\beta$. In particular $\tilde f$ is onto $\beta Y$ due to two reasons: $\tilde f$ is continuous from a compact domain, therefore its image is closed; and $\tilde f$ is onto a dense subset of $\beta Y$. Therefore it is onto its closure which is $\beta Y$. My question is whether or not the fact $Y$ is paracompact lets us extend the map such that $\tilde f$ is also an open surjection.

points in $C$ have the same image if they they are mapped to each other

66443,A square matrix has the same minimal polynomial over its base field as it has over an extension field,"I think I have heard that the following is true before, but I don't know how to prove it: Let $A$ be a matrix with real entries. Then the minimal polynomial of $A$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is the same as the minimal polynomial of $A$ over $\mathbb{R}$. Is this true? Would anyone be willing to provide a proof? Attempt at a proof: Let $M(t)$ be the minimal polynomial over the reals, and $P(t)$ over the complex numbers. We can look at $M$ as a polynomial over $\Bbb C$, in which case it will fulfil $M(A)=0$, and therefore $P(t)$ divides it. In addition, we can look at $P(t)$ as the sum of two polynomials: $R(t)+iK(t)$. Plugging $A$ we get that $R(A)+iK(A)=P(A)=0$, but this forces both $R(A)=0$ and $K(A)=0$. Looking at both $K$ and $R$ as real polynomials, we get that $M(t)$ divides them both, and therefore divides $R+iK=P$. Now $M$ and $P$ are monic polynomials, and they divide each other, therefore $M=P$. Does this look to be correct? More generally, one might prove the following Let $A$ be any square matrix with entries in a field$~K$, and let $F$ be an extension field of$~K$.
