3144103,Is it possible to find $n^{th}$ derivative of $\frac{1}{e^{ax}+b}$?,"Is it possible to find $n^{th}$ derivative of $\frac{1}{e^{ax}+b}$ ? I am introduced to $n^{th}$ differentiation and leibniz theorem as a first year undergraduate.
But what i observe is there are some explicit formula for the $n^{th}$ derivative of $\sin x$ , $\cos x$ , $\log(ax+b)$ , $\frac{1}{ax+b}$ , etc but why there isn't any method given for $\sec x$ , $\csc x$ etc. If the highlighted question can be answered then it is possible to find the $n^{th}$ derivative of secx.
How ? $$y=\sec x=\frac{1}{\cos x}=\frac{2 e^{ix}}{e^{2ix}+1}$$ Now one can use lebniz theorem of $n^{th}$ differentiation to find the n derivative of product of two functions whose general derivative is known. Now here $e^{ix}$ whose derivative can be found easily. The latter part $\frac{1}{e^{2ix+1}}$ is not known.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'algebra-precalculus']"

3144190,Product in category of cyclic groups.,"I know that if $ G_1, G_2 $ are cyclic groups then $ G_1 \times G_2 $ is cyclic if and only if $ |G_1| $ and $ |G_2| $ are coprimes. But I have to reponds a similar question in the context of category theory: show that $ \mathbb{Z}_n $ , $ \mathbb{Z}_m $ have a product in the category of cyclic groups if and only if $ n, m $ are coprimes. For the implication $ \leftarrow \ $ I consider that $ n,m $ coprimes $ \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m $ is cyclic, so this group is an element of the cateogory. Now we can take the proyection $$
p_1 : \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n 
,\ \ \ \
p_1(x,y) = x
$$ and $$ 
p_2 : \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_m
, \ \ \ \
p_2(x,y) = y 
$$ that are homomorphism. Easily I can show that $ \mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m $ and $ p_1, p_2 $ form a product of $ \mathbb{Z}_n $ and $ \mathbb{Z}_m $ in the category of cyclic groups. But I am stuck in the proof of the implication $ \rightarrow $ .","['group-theory', 'category-theory']"

3144386,if $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) = 1$ then $f$ is positive,"I am having these two results : 
  Let $f \in C^1([0,1], \mathbb{R})$ : (1) If $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) >0$ then there is a $\epsilon > 0$ such that $f(x) \geq 0$ on $]0, \epsilon[$ (2) If $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ and $f$ is positive there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that $f'$ is positive on $[0, \epsilon[$ and negative on $]1-\epsilon, 1]$ Note that these are assumptions so I am not sure both these results are true. I think I might have a solution for $(1)$ using an aysmptics. Since $f$ is $C^1$ we have : $f(h) = f(0) + hf'(0) + o(h)$ in a neighboorhood of $0$ . Thus $f(h) = hf'(0) + \epsilon(h)$ where $\epsilon$ is a continuous function which goes to $0$ when $h \to 0$ .Yet since $hf'(0) = O(h)$ (since $f'(0) > 0)$ then $hf'(0) \geq \epsilon(h)$ for $h$ small enough. Hence there is an $\epsilon$ which veryfy the conditions of $(1)$ Is it correct ? 
If it's correct I am really interested in an other way of proving this result. Moreover I don't at all how to proceed for $(2)$ . Thank you.","['partial-differential-equations', 'sequences-and-series', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

3144509,How to convert a rate involving radians to something that can be applied to a straight direction in a related rates problem.,"I can do related rates problems a little bit, but I've been given one that requires me to use a rate of $\frac{-\pi}{6}$ radians per second to figure out how fast a plane is going. Since I assume that plane is moving in a straight line, I'm not sure how to proceed. I think the answer might be to find out how fast the given rate is moving in terms of horizontal speed, and then apply implicit differentiation on that to find the answer, but I'm not sure. I could use the angular velocity formula, $\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}$ , but I'm worried that's not the right way since it gives an average. How can I convert a rate with radians to a rate involving purely horizontal/straight movement? Problem Text: A plane flies horizontally at an altitude of 5 km and passes directly over a tracking telescope on the ground. When the angle of elevation is π/3, this angle is decreasing at the rate of π/6 radians per minute. How fast is the plane traveling at that time? I have worked through it, and I've discovered that the plane, the telescope, and the distance of the plane from the ground can be formed into a right triangle. Since, $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians is $60^\circ$ and a right triangle has a $90^\circ$ corner too, that means the the last corner must also be $60^\circ$ . Using the Law of Sines, I have found the hypotenuse is $\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}$ kilometers long and the other two edges are both $5$ kilometers. I haven't been able to get further than that.","['word-problem', 'calculus', 'implicit-differentiation', 'related-rates', 'derivatives']"

Then he asked me what are the other definitions of a prime number? To which I had no answer as I don't know any other definition. Then he said the following- A natural number $n > 1$ is a prime number if and only if $(n-1)!=-1 (\text{mod} ~n).$ Which is basically the statement of Wilson's theorem.

\mu*\nu(E)&=&\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}1_E(t)f(t-y)g(y)d\lambda(t)d\lambda(y)

3144616,Is $\sin^2+\cos^2-1=0$ the only relation for $\sin$ and $\cos$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is Pythagoras the only relation to hold between $\cos$ and $\sin$? (2 answers) Closed 5 years ago . I'm trying to figure out if for any polynomial $f$ , $f(\cos(t),\sin(t))=\sum_{i,j}a_{i,j}\cos(t)^i\sin(t)^j=0$ implies $x^2+y^2-1$ divides $f$ . Trigonometric identities are not exactly central to the class I am taking, so I believe the question simply wants me to assume this, but I'm still curious as to why it is true. In trying to prove this, I know that through polynomial division one can get $f=qg+r$ where the degree of $x$ in $r$ is 1 or 0 and $r(\cos(t),\sin(t))=0$ . If the degree of $x$ in $r$ is zero we simply have a polynomial in $\sin(t)$ , and a polynomial only has finitely many roots whereas $\sin(t)$ can take infinitely many values, so $r=0$ . If the degree of $x$ in $r$ is one, and there is only an $x$ term, one can argue that we can choose $t$ to make all the $\sin$ terms arbitrarily small and the $\cos$ term close to 1, and if the constant term is equal to -1 just stop close to 1, and if it is close to -1 stop at 1. However, I don't know how to proceed when there are terms like $xy$ in $r$ .

3144655,Recovering a matrix from a linear ODE given observations,"To make this simple, let's say we have $x: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $$\frac{d}{dt}\vec{x}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} x_1'(t) \\ x_2'(t) \end{pmatrix} = A \vec{x}(t)$$ for some constant matrix $A$ . We know that the general solution has the form $$\vec{x}(t) = e^{A t} \begin{pmatrix}x_1(0) \\ x_2(0) \end{pmatrix},$$ where $e^{At}$ denotes the matrix exponential . Suppose we are given $\vec{x}(0)$ and also have the observations $$\hat{x}(t_1), \ldots, \hat{x}(t_k) $$ for some known collection $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^k.$ Right now, we don't worry about whether the observations are noisy; we just assume they are perfect. The goal is to recover the matrix $A$ , rather than $\vec{x}(t)$ . All we know is that $A$ is constant. This is stumping me, because it seems so simple; however, the standard matrix differential equation techniques (e.g. here ) usually assume that $A$ is given. One option numerically is to define the error function $$ err(A) = \sum_{i=1}^k \| \vec{x}(t_i,A) - \hat{x}(t_i)\|^2 $$ for the given $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^k$ and compute $$ \min_{A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}} err(A) $$ in $\texttt{Matlab}$ (or some other program). However, I keep getting incorrect/unstable results, which is worrisome since $A$ is only $2 \times 2$ .

3144663,When does the recurrence $a_k = 3a_{k - 1} + 1$ reach a power of 2?,"Almost a year ago, I posed a question on Brilliant involving the following recurrence: Given $n$ , let $a_0 = n$ and $a_k = 3a_{k - 1} + 1$ . That question asked whether for any choice of $n$ , the sequence generated by this recurrence always contained a power of 2. (The answer is no, see below for examples). It is useful to put this problem in Diophantine equation form. Since $a_k = 3^kn + (3^k - 1)/2$ (easily shown by induction), if $a_x = 2^y$ at some point, we have the Diophantine equation $$2^{y + 1} + 1 = 3^x(2n + 1).$$ I thought an interesting problem would be to classify values of $n$ for which the sequence never reaches a power 2. Did a bit of computer checking up to $n < 10^8$ , and I was surprised to see that for most values of $n$ , they do not reach a power of 2 for $a_k < 1 \text{ googol}$ , and when they do, do so within the first handful of sequence elements. ( Computational results here. ) Low-hanging fruit: Trivial case: If $n = 2^x$ , $a_0$ is a power of 2. For $n > 2$ , if $n \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$ , then $a_k \mod 4$ cycles between 2 and 3 (for consecutive terms in the sequence), and thus will never be divisible by 4, and so will never reach a power of 2 greater than 2. So, for $n > 2$ , we only need to consider the case where $n \equiv 0,1 \pmod{4}$ . For $k > 0$ , $a_k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ , so $a_k \neq 2^{2m + 1} \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$ for positive $k$ . In other words, if we look past the trivial case, we are actually looking for powers of 4. For $n = (3^z - 1)/2$ where $z > 2$ , the equation above implies $2^{y + 1} + 1 = 3^{x + z}$ , whereupon Mihăilescu's theorem (Catalan conjecture) stipulates $y + 1 = 3$ and $x + z = 2$ . In particular, since $x \geq 0$ , $z \leq 2$ , contra $z > 2$ in our assumption. So for such $n$ , the sequence contains no power of 2. But, my question is whether there is a known complete characterization of $n$ such that the sequence starting with $a_0 = n$ contains no powers of 2. To be specific, I think I will define ""complete characterization"" to mean an algorithm (with finite resources, including time) which when given an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , determines whether the sequence $a_0, a_1, \dots$ contains a power of 2. Put another way, I am looking for a predicate $P$ for which the following statement is true: $\forall n : [(a_0 = n \wedge P(n)) \Leftrightarrow \forall x,y : a_x \neq 2^y]$ . Please let me know if anything requires clarification/elaboration.","['number-theory', 'perfect-powers', 'recurrence-relations', 'diophantine-equations']"
3144672,"Simplifying $\prod\limits_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{\lambda_{n,k}-\lambda_{n,j}}$ for $\lambda_{n,k}=\exp\frac{i\pi(2k+1)}{n}$","I have been able to show that for $n\in\Bbb N_{\geq2}$ $$\phi(n)=\int_0^1\frac{dx}{x^n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{n,k}\log\frac{\lambda_{n,k}-1}{\lambda_{n,k}}$$ Where $$\lambda_{n,k}=\exp\frac{i\pi(2k+1)}{n}$$ And $$\Gamma_{n,k}=\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{\lambda_{n,k}-\lambda_{n,j}}$$ And I was wondering: how do we simplify $\Gamma_{n,k}$ to ease the manual calculation of $\phi(n)$ values. The integral is always real, so I am sure there is a major way we can simplify $\Gamma_{n,k}$ , but I have been so far unable to find it. I do suspect however that the product $$P_n=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{n,k}$$ May play a significant role in finding the simplification I seek. For those interested, a proof. Note that $x^n+1$ bay be factored as $$x^n+1=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,k})$$ Hence $$\phi(n)=\int_0^1\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac1{x-\lambda_{n,k}}dx$$ Then define $\Gamma_{n,k}$ by saying that $$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac1{x-\lambda_{n,k}}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\Gamma_{n,k}}{x-\lambda_{n,k}}$$ Multiplying both sides by $\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$ : $$1=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\Gamma_{n,k}}{x-\lambda_{n,k}}\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$$ $$1=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{n,k}\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$$ So for any integer $0\leq m\leq n-1$ we may plug in $x=\lambda_{n,m}$ and simplify to get $$\Gamma_{n,m}=\prod_{m\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{\lambda_{n,m}-\lambda_{n,j}}$$ And our result follows directly. Perhaps another motivation for easing manual calculation of this product would be that $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{nk+1}=\phi(n)$$ Which brings about a plethora of interesting closed forms.

The definition is that $T_t$ and $T^*$ should map $L^p$ functions to measurable functions $X\to\mathbb{C}$ .) Incidentally: Well, the proof of this particular theorem carries over verbatim if we use Lebesgue outer measure instead. However, later in the book the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem is used for these maximal functions, so it seems that we have to prove its measurability... For specific functions (such as the famous Hardy–Littlewood maximal function), the measurability can be proved directly (in this case, one observes that it suffices to take rational $t$ ). In general, I need the measurability of the following type of maximal functions (as is used later in the book): Let $\phi\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $\int\phi=1$ . Let $\phi_t=t^{-n}\phi(x/t)$ .

It says that an object's temperature rate of change (time derivative) is proportional to the difference of temperatures of object and surrounding. $$\frac{\partial{T}}{\partial t} = k(T(t)-T_s)$$ Usually here $T_s$ (Temperature of (s)urrounding) is assumed constant. But what happens if $T_s$ is not constant? For example let us model outdoor temperature as a cosine with minimum at midnight: $$T_s(t) = 20-10\cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{24}\right)$$ This could be a typical Swedish summer day, temperature between $10$ and $30$ degrees (celcius). Assume at a party someone forgets a beer at pre-party $t=22$ in evening ( $10$ pm ) but finds it again at after-party $t=26$ ( $2$ am ).

I did it again and again and kept getting this answer, but no matter what I tried I couldn't manipulate the above expression to match one of my multiple choice answers.

To the best of my knowledge, this is not a duplicate question. While there are similar-sounding questions, answers to them usually cite: Vitali sets.

You can totally have a probability measure and $\sigma$ -algebra containing Vitali sets. Lebesgue measures. Same objection as above. Banach-Tarski. But measures must be at least rotation-invariant to prevent Banach-Tarski (or live in 2-D). Probability measures don’t need to be rotation-invariant, so Banach-Tarski is irrelevant.

I know only basic definition of divisors so correct me if I write something wrong. Example: In the cone $XZ-Y^2$ , the line $X=Y=0$ is a Weil divisor $D$ . Then $D$ is not a Cartier divisor but $2D$ is, and $2D$ is a principal divisor. What is the function that give the principal divisor $2D$ ? Is it just $X^2$ ? Then why function $X$ does not give a principal divisor $D$ ?","['divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Intuitively speaking, it is quite obvious that there is no number $x$ that would make this inequality true, and in checking a graph of the equation I am now certain of this. Despite the textbook not asking for a proof, I am curious as to how one would go about proving this rigorously? Would this require using multiple cases or is it possible without? Thanks for any insight.

We start with the same triangle $$1$$ $$1---1$$ The next line will be $$1---3---1$$ because we added the first $1$ aligned with the result of adding $1+1$ from row $2$ . If we keep using this rule, we will get a Pascal's triangle whose diagonals are very interesting. Since I don't know how to format a Pascal's triangle with mathjax, I will simply list few diagonals. The first diagonal is: $$1--3--5--7--9--11--13--15--15--17--19--21...$$ The second diagonal is given by $A001844$ which gives centered square numbers. $$1--5--13--25--41--61--85--113--145--181--221...$$ The third diagonal is given by $A001845$ which gives centered octahedral numbers (also called crystal ball sequence for cubic lattice). $$1--7--25--63--129--231--377--575--833--1159...$$ The fourth diagonal is given by $A001846$ which gives centered 4-dimensional orthoplex numbers (also called crystal ball sequence for 4-dimensional cubic lattice). $$1--9--41--129--321--681--1289--2241--3649...$$ The fifth diagonal is given by $A001847$ which gives crystal ball sequence for 5-dimensional cubic lattice numbers. The sixth diagonal is given by $A001848$ which gives crystal ball sequence for 6-dimensional cubic lattice numbers. I suppose the next sequence will give the 7-dimensional cubic lattice numbers ( I checked it ) and higher. Some of the formulas to generate the numbers are given in the OEIS sequences given above. The first $7$ rows of the this triangle look like this: $$1$$ $$1---1$$ $$1---3---1$$ $$1---5---5---1$$ $$1---7---13---7---1$$ $$1---9---25---25---9---1$$ $$1---11---41---63---41---11---1$$ Note the pattern that repeats indefinitely formed by multiplying numbers under the starting $1$ at the top in the following way: $$1*3+1*1=4=2^2=(1+1)^2$$ $$3*13+5*5=64=8^2=(3+5)^2$$ $$13*63+25*25=1444=38^2=(13+25)^2$$ . The triangle has other properties that deserve to be mentioned. If we add term by term the first diagonal and the second to get: $$(1+1),(3+5), (5+13), (7+25), (9+41), (11+61), (13+85)...$$ we get the sequence $2n^2$ . If we add the second diagonal and the third term by term, we get the sequence A035597 which gives the number of points of L1 norm 3 in cubic lattice Z^n. Its formula is ( $4n^3+2n)/3$ : $$(1+1), (5+7), (13+25), (25+63), (41+129), (61+231)...$$ But we can also get new numbers by multiplying term by term the first and second diagonals. We get OEIS A005917 Rhombic dodecahedral numbers: $a(n) = n^4 - (n - 1)^4$ $$1, 15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105, 1695, 2465, 3439...$$ There are probably more hidden patterns waiting to be found in this triangle. Only a systematic search can find them.
