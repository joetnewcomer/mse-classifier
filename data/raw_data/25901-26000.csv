236422,Summing over conditional probabilities,"I've seen the following formula being used in various places: $P(a|b) = \sum_z P(a|z) \times P(z|b)$ So essentially they sum over all the variables z to get the original conditional probability. Is this correct, and does it make any strong assumptions? I am confused by the following example: $P(good\ weather | month) = \\
\sum_{z \in \{T,F\}} P(good\ weather| universe\ exists = z) * P(universe\ exists = z| month) = \\
P(good\ weather|universe\ exists = T)
$ It starts off with the probability of having good weather, given the current month. We then introduce an additional variable (does the universe exist), and sum over all values (T,F). Let's say that the universe exists with probability 1.0, then: $P(universe\ exists = T| month) = 1.0$ $P(universe\ exists = F| month) = 0.0$ Therefore, we end up with: $P(good\ weather | month) = P(good\ weather | universe\ exists = T)$ Now, somewhere I have clearly lost some important information, because I'm showing that the conditional probability of good weather, depending on the month, is equal to the probability of good weather, given that the universe exists.

$$\lim_{x \to c} -\frac{(c-x)^{n-1}}{(x^n \cdot c^n)}=-\lim_{x \to c} \frac{(c-x)^{n-1}}{(x^n \cdot c^n)}=-\lim_{x \to c} \frac{(0)^{n-1}}{(c^n \cdot c^n)}=-\lim_{x \to c} \frac{0}{c^{2n}}=0$$ But I dont think it's okay since I know the derivative of $\frac{1}{x^n} \neq 0$ So how should I do this then?

I presume that what I have to show is that for any non-zero $b \in F$, where $b = c/d$ that $c, d \in D_F$ I have started by assuming $b\in F$ is an algebraic number. I can show that any element of $F$ (as an algebraic number field) satisfies a not-necessarily monic polynomial. And clearing denominators, the polynomial becomes: $a_nb^n + a_{n - 1}b^{n - 1} + \dots + a_0 = 0$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ Then multiplying through by $a_n^{n - 1}$ gives a monic polynomial with integral coefficients: $(a_{n}b)^n + a_{n - 1}(a_{n}b)^{n - 1} + \dots + a_{n}^{n - 1}a_0 = 0$, so $a_{n}b \in D_F$ Hopefully I'm on the right track.

   add up (probability of moving to a next-state)*(probability of ending game in that state) so this function will recursively search for whether game could be ended in that state.

Let $G$ be a group with order divisible by $3$, and find a maximal $3$-free subgroup $H$ (one that is not contained in any other $3$-free subgroup). Pick a $g\in G\setminus H$ and let $d$ be the least positive integer such that $g^d\in H$. Then $g^iH=g^jH$ iff $i\equiv j\text{ mod }d$, so the subgroup (of $G$) $H'=\langle g\rangle H$ has $|H'|=d\cdot |H|$. $|H'|$ must be divisible by $3$, so $d$ is divisible by $3$, and therefore the order $k$ of $g$ is divisible by $3$, so $g^{k/3}$ has order $3$.

237457,Showing the distance between sets is indeed a metric.,"Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and let $A$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. Define the distance between a point and a set by the function
$$d(x,A) = \inf_{z \in A}d(x,z).$$ Prove that for all $x,y \in X$,
$$d(x,A) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,A).$$ Note that it is rather trivial to show that $d(x,A) \geq 0$ for all $x \in X$ and $A \subseteq X$ (follows directly from non-negativity of a metric); $d(x,A) = 0$ iff $x$ is in the closure of $A$; and $d(x,A) = d(A,x)$ (by abuse of notation). By proving the final property of the triangle inequality, we can conclude that the modified distance $d: X \times 2^X \to R$ and its mirrored version $d: 2^X \times X \to R$ forms a sort of pseudo-metric where $d(x,A) = 0$ does not define an equivalence relation. If we were to modify this function further by first defining $d(x,A)$ to be substituted with $d({x},A)$, we can form a more general pseudo-metric space $(2^X, d:2^X \times 2^X \to R)$ via defining
$$d(A,B) = \inf\{d(a,b) : a \in A, b \in B\}.$$
It should be noted that in this particular metric, $A = B$ means that $A$ and $B$ are not separated. That is, if $A'$ denotes the closure of $A$, then $A \subseteq B'$ and $B \subseteq A'$.
Then we know that (and can verify 4) $d(A,B) \geq 0$; $d(A,B) > 0$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ are separated (i.e., $A$ is not in the closure of $B$, and $B$ is not in the closure of $A$); $d(A,B) = d(B,A)$; and $d(A,B) \leq d(A,C) + d(C,B)$, for all subsets $C \subseteq X$. Note that since (2) does not define an equivalence relation on $2^X$, this particular function does not define an actual metric space.","['metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

I also remember how I solved it. Fix $\epsilon > 0$. Since $f'$ is a continuous function on a compact interval, it is uniformly continuous and we can find a $\delta > 0$ such that $|x-y| < \delta$ implies $|f'(x) - f'(y)| < \epsilon$ for $x ,y \in [0,1]$.
