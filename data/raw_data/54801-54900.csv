588498,"Real Analysis, limit of function using binomial theorem.","We have $b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $ 0<b<1$, I need to show that $\lim(nb^n)=0$ My attempt: Since $0<b<1$ we can express b as $\frac{1}{1+a_n}$ so now our sequence is $nb^n=n\left(\frac{1}{1+a_n}\right)^n=\frac{n}{(1+a_n)^n}$, we can use the binomial theorem to express $b^n=\frac{1}{1+na_n+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)a_n^2+...}\leq\frac{1}{1+na_n+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)a_n^2}$ So we have $nb^n \leq \frac{n}{1+na_n+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)a_n^2}$. I am stuck after this, I am uncertain how to keep going from there.

588505,How many ways can N elements be partitioned into subsets of size K?,"Let's have $2$ numbers, $N$ and $K$ , where $K$ divides $N$ . The number of $K$ -combinations from a given set $S$ of $N$ elements is a well-known formula. Let's concatenate $N/K$ groups (resulting in $N$ elements) such that the resulting set is $N$ . How many possibilities are there, i.e. what's the formula? For instance: $N=4$ , and $K=2$ , gives $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ $\{1,2\}$ , $\{1,3\}$ , $\{1,4\}$ , $\{2,3\}$ , $\{2,4\}$ , $\{3,4\}$ The $3$ possibilities are: $\{1,2\}$ , $\{3,4\}$ $\{1,3\}$ , $\{2,4\}$ $\{1,4\}$ , $\{2,3\}$ I generated these combinations and I think the number goes like this: $$
\begin{align}
(4, 2)&: 3 \\
(6, 3)&: 10 \\
(6, 2)&: 15 \\
(10, 5)&: 126 \\
(9, 3)&: 280 \\

588545,Every open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is the union of a countable collection of closed sets.,"I want to prove the following statement which is in The Elements of Real Analysis by Robert G. Bartle, on page 67 exercise H: Every open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is the union of a countable collection of closed sets .
(Hint: Argue as in the preceding exercise, but this time use closed balls) I have referred to the to the solution given in this question , but the approach is different from what the book is asking for. I first show the preceding exercise and its proof, and then I show my attempt at the statement that I want to prove. Preceding Exercise: A subset of $\mathbb{R}^{p}$
  is open iff it is the union of a countable collection of open balls. proof .
$(\leftarrow )$ An open ball is an open set, and by property 9.3(c) the union of any collection of open sets in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$
  is indeed open in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$. That is that the union of a countable collection of open balls is open in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$, hence it is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{p}$. $(\rightarrow)$ Let $G\neq\emptyset$
 , $G\subset\mathbb{R}^{p}$
  be open, let $\{r_{n}\::\: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$
  be an enumeration of all the rational points in $G$
  (that is that each of the $p$
  components of a point of $G$
 , consisting of only rational numbers). Now we let $\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}}$)
  where $m_{n}$
  is the smallest natural number such that $\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset G$
 . Clearly,$$\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset G$$. Now if we let $x\in G$
 , since $G$
  is open we know that there exists a ball centered at $x$
 , choose $m$
  such that $\mathcal{B}(x,\frac{2}{m})\subset G$
 . Now it follows from Theorem 6.10 that there exists a rational number $y\in\mathcal{B} (x,\frac{1}{m})$
 ; thus $y\in G$
  and therefore $y=r_{n}\in\{r_{n}\::\: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$
  for some $n$
 . If $x\notin\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
  then we must have that $\frac{1}{m_{n}}<\frac{1}{m}$
 . [(why?) $y\in\mathcal{B}(x,\frac{1}{m})$
  implies that the distance $d(x,y)<\frac{1}{m}$
 , while $x\notin\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})=\mathcal{B}(y,\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
  implies that the distance $d(x,y)\geqslant\frac{1}{m_{n}}$
 ; hence $\frac{1}{m_{n}}<\frac{1}{m}$
 ]. Now, clearly $\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m})\subset\mathcal{B}(x,\frac{2}{m})\subset G$
  which contradict our selections on $m_{n}$
 , thus $x\in\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
 . [(again,why?) Let $\alpha\in\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m})$
 , then $d(\alpha,y)<1/m$
  it follows from the triangle inequality that $d(x,\alpha)\leqslant d(x,y)+d(y,\alpha)<\frac{2}{m}$
 ; hence $\alpha\in\mathcal{B}(x,\frac{2}{m})$
  and therefore $\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m})\subset\mathcal{B}(x,\frac{2}{m})$
 ]. Now, since $x$
  was arbitrarly in $G$
 , it follows that for each $x\in G$
  there exists $n$
  such that $x\in\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
 ; hence $G\subset\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
 which shows that $G=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\frac{1}{m_{n}})$. $\square$ Proposition to be proved: Every open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is the union of a countable collection of closed sets. proof. Let $G\ne\emptyset$
 , $G\subset\mathbb{R}^{p}$
  be open, let $\{r_{n}\::\: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$
  be an enumeration of all the rational points in $G$
 . Since, $G$
  is open for every $r_{n}$
  there exists an open ball $\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n})$
  contained in $G$ . Moreover, for each $r_{n}$
  there exists a closed ball $\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset\mathcal{B}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n})\subset\begin{subarray}{c}
G\end{subarray}$
 , where $m_{n}$
  is the smallest natural number such that $\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}}>0$
 . (i.e. $\frac{1}{m_{n}}<\varepsilon_{n}$
  ). Clearly, $$\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset G.$$ Now we pick an arbitrary $x\in G$
 , since $G$
  is open we can find a $\mathcal{B}(x,\varepsilon_{m})\subset G$; choose $m\in\mathbb{N}$
  so that $m$
  is the smallest number such that $\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m}>0$
  and $\overline{\mathcal{B}}(x,\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m})\begin{subarray}{c}
\subset\end{subarray}\mathcal{B}(x,\varepsilon_{m})$
 . Now, since $\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m}>0$
  it follows that there must exist a rational number $y\in\overline{\mathcal{B}}(x,\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m})$
 . [hence $y=r_{n}$
  for some $n$
  and $\mathcal{\overline{B}}(y,\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})=\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset\mathcal{B}(x,\varepsilon_{m})$
 ]. Suppose that $x\notin\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
 , then $d(x,y)>\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}}$
 , but we know $d(x,y)\leqslant\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m}$
  so it follows that $0<\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}}<\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m}$
 . Now, let $\alpha\in\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})$
  it follows that $d(\alpha,y)\leqslant\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}}$
  and that $d(x,\alpha)\leqslant d(\alpha,y)+d(y,x)\leqslant\left(\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}}\right)+\left(\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m}\right)$. As you might see by now I am spinning my wheels and getting no where! If I could show that $x\in\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})$ then I would be done, or likewise if I could show $\overline{\mathcal{B}}(r_{n},\varepsilon_{n}-\frac{1}{m_{n}})\subset\overline{\mathcal{B}}(x,\varepsilon_{m}-\frac{1}{m})$ but I can't do either of these, because I don't have any way to relate $\varepsilon_{n}$ to $\varepsilon_{m}$. Perhaps my approach is entirely wrong. I would greatly appreciate some guidance, thanks!","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
588575,"Can the ""inducing"" vector norm be deduced or ""recovered"" from an induced norm?","Can the ""inducing"" vector norm be deduced or ""recovered"" from an induced (operator) norm? This question occurred to me after seeing this question .  I'm hoping that perhaps there exists something like the polarization identity , i.e. some identity one may use to ""recover"" the vector norm the same way the polarization identity ""recovers"" the inner product. I am aware that any induced norm satisfies the inequality
$$
\left|\|A^r\|\right|^{1/r} \geq \rho(A)
$$
Also, there exists some invertible matrix $S$ such that
$$
\left|\|SAS^{-1}\|\right| = \rho(A)
$$
I'm wondering if one or both of the above might also be a sufficient condition for $\left|\|\cdot \|\right|$ to be a derived norm, and that they might somehow be used to derive some sort of identity producing the necessary vector norm. Any input is appreciated! Runaway train of thought below: Following HHO's advice (see comment below), here's a neat way to recover the vector norm (assuming that a suitable vector norm does exist): Let $\|\cdot \|_O$ denote the operator norm.  I will define a vector norm $\|\cdot \|$ as follows: arbitrarily, I set $\|e_1\| = 1$ (because $\alpha \|\cdot\|$ is a vector norm for any $\alpha>0$ and any vector norm $\|\cdot\|$ and since both of these result in the same induced norm, we may set $\|e_1\| = \alpha$ for any $\alpha>0$).  From there, we may define
$$
\|u\| = \left\| u e_1^* \right\|_O = 
\left\| 
\pmatrix{|&|&&|\\
u&0&\cdots&0\\
|&|&&|}
\right\|_O
$$ What remains to be seen is under which conditions this defines a valid vector-norm. In fact, the above must always be a valid vector-norm, by the definition of a matrix norm.  It is necessary to check whether the vector norm produced above induces the operator norm that we started with. By the above, here's a neat criterion for checking whether $\|\cdot\|_O$ is an operator norm: We can state that $\|\cdot\|_O$ is an induced (matrix) norm if and only if for all $A \in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$, we have
$$
\|A\|_O = \max_{x \neq 0} \frac{\|Ax e_1^*\|_O}{\|xe_1^*\|_O}
$$
and, presumably, $e_1$ can be replaced by any convenient $v \in \mathbb{F}^n: v^*v = 1$.  I guess I answered my own question then. Is this a known theorem?  This question is now a reference request.  If anyone has seen something like this, please say so.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'reference-request']"

588707,"Chain Rule, Reciprocals of Derivatives, and Differentiating w.r.t a Function","I'm vey confused by this. $\frac{df^2}{df}=2f$, by the power rule. If $f=x+y$, it turns into $\frac{d(x+y)^2}{d(x+y)} = 2(x+y)$. With the chain rule and expanding, this equals $\frac{\partial (x^2+2xy+y^2)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial (x+y)} + \frac{\partial (x^2+2xy+y^2)}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial (x+y)}$. $\frac{\partial (x+y)}{\partial x} = 1$, so $\frac{\partial x}{\partial (x+y)} = 1$. Plugging this in gives $\frac{\partial (x^2+2xy+y^2)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (x^2+2xy+y^2)}{\partial y} = (2x+2y) + (2x+2y) = 4x + 4y$, which is twice the correct answer. I've tried this with more than two variables and differentiating w.r.t. more complex functions, and each time it is equal to the correct answer multiplied by the number of variables, even if x, y, etc. are treated differently. I don't think it's an issue with the chain rule, as it's used verbatim in this, and I looked up the rule for the reciprocals of partial derivatives and that is valid too, so I can't find the issue. Any insights? Edit: Actually, I'm still confused. If $u=x+y$, then $x=u-y$. This seems to say that $\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}=1$. Also, according to the implicit function theorem (I think), $\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}=1$: $F(u, x, y) = u-(x+y) = 0 \rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} = -\frac{\partial F / \partial u}{\partial F / \partial x} = -\frac{1}{-1} = 1$.

Proof Two vector spaces $U$ and $V$ are isomorphic if and only if there exists a bijection $\phi: U \to V$. That is, an invertible linear map between the two. Let $\dim(U) = \dim(V) = n$ and let $\left\{u_1, \dots, u_n\right\}$ and $\left\{v_1, \dots, v_n\right\}$ be bases for $U$ and $V$, respectively.

u = c_1u_1 + \cdots + c_nu_n
$$ We define $\phi: U \to V$ as $$
\phi(c_1u_1 + \cdots + c_nu_n) = c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_nv_n
$$ Observe that $\phi$ is invertible. That is, given a vector $$
v = d_1v_1 + \cdots + d_nv_n
$$ in $V$, we define $\phi^{-1}: V \to U$ as $$

\tag{1} $$ by a direct calculation, that is, not relying on some geometry. Background. This integral is a by-product of the Schläfli's formula for some orthoscheme (special kind of tetrahedron) in the 3-sphere, according to the problem posed by Prof. H. S. M. Coxeter in AMM 95 (1988). He originally asked to find the value of $$ \int_{1}^{6} \frac{\operatorname{arcsec} t}{(t+2)\sqrt{t+1}} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{t+3}} + 2 \right] \, dt = \frac{2\pi^{2}}{15} $$ without appealing to geometry or the computer. Then another literature shows that it is also written as $$ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} \arccos\left( \frac{\cos\theta}{1 + 2\cos\theta} \right) \, d\theta = \frac{2\pi^{2}}{15}. $$ (I guess they are related by the volume of the same geometric object, but I'm not sure since the literature is written in French which I can hardly read.) Applying some manipulations to the last integral, we obtain the four times of the left-hand side of $\text{(1)}$. My trial. Numerical tests show that the constant $\sqrt{5}$ in $\text{(1)}$ is very special; it seems that no other square root of integer (other than 1) gives a rational multiple of $\pi^{2}$.

589079,Convergence of measure sequences bounded by a finite measure,"Let $\{\mu_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of measures on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\{\mu_n\}$ converge to a function $\mu$. In other words, suppose that for every $A\in\mathcal{A}$, $\lim \mu_n(A) = \mu(A)$. Also, suppose that there is a finite measure $\nu$ on $\mathcal{A}$, such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and for every set $A\in\mathcal{A}$, $\mu_n(A)\le\nu(A)$. Prove that $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$. Does this remain true if the measure $\nu$ is not finite? I was able to prove that $\mu$ is indeed a measure: 1.) $\mu: \mathcal{A}\longrightarrow[0,\infty]$. Proof: Since $\mu_n$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then we must have $\mu_n:\mathcal{A}\longrightarrow[0,\infty]$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But suppose there exists some $A\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $\mu(A)\not\in[0,\infty]$, so $\mu(A)\in[-\infty,0)$. Thus there exists some $\varepsilon>0$ such that $\mu(A)+\varepsilon=0$. But since $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu_n(A)=\mu(A)$, then there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|\mu(A)-\mu_N(A)|<\varepsilon$. Thus for all $n>N$ we would have $\mu_n(A)<0$, a contradiction. Thus $\mu: \mathcal{A}\longrightarrow[0,\infty]$. 2.) $\mu(\emptyset)=0$. Proof: Since $\mu_n$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then we must have $\mu_n(\emptyset)=0$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Thus 
$$
\mu(\emptyset)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu_n(\emptyset)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}0=0.
$$ 3.) $\mu\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k\right)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\mu(A_k)$. Proof: Since $\nu$ is a finite measure on $\mathcal{A}$, then for a countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets $\{A_i\}\in\mathcal{A}$ we have 
$$
\nu\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k\right)=\sum_{i=k}^\infty\nu(A_k)<\infty.
$$
Now for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we have $\mu_n(A_k)<\nu(A_k)$, so the Weierstrass M-Test tells us that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu_n(A_k)$ converges uniformly for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. So finally we have
$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu_n\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k\right)\overset{(1)}{=}\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\mu_n(A_i)\overset{(2)}{=}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu_n(A_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\mu(A_k),
$$
where (1) is guaranteed since $\mu_n$ is a measure for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and (2) is guaranteed by the uniform convergence of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu_n(A_k)$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Thus $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$. Clearly, when $\nu$ is not a finite measure, we cannot claim uniform convergence and pass the limit inside the summation. I would like a good example that demonstrates this. Any ideas?",['measure-theory']

Then there is a unique linear map $f^*: W \to V$ such that $$\langle f(v),w \rangle = \langle v, f^*(w)\rangle$$ for all $v\in V, w \in W$. Here's how far I got so far. Try 1: Fix $w \in W$. Because $V$ is finite-dimensional there exists a unique $x \in V$ for all linear forms $\psi_1 = \langle f(\cdot),w \rangle \in V^*$ --- namely we have the isomorphism $V \to V^*$. Since the linear form $\langle f(\cdot),w \rangle$ is uniquely determined by $w \in W$, define the linear map $f^*$ by $x = f^*(w)$. Let $\psi_2 = \langle \cdot,f^*(w) \rangle \in V^*$  and $\theta = \psi_1 - \psi_2 \in V^*$. Now consider ker$(\theta)$. If ker$(\theta)$ = $V$ then our claim is proven --- namely $\psi_1 = \psi_2$. Mistake: Firstly $\psi_1 \in W^*$, and not in $V^*$. And because $W \to W^*$ need not be an isomorphism the argument doens't follow. EDIT: $\psi_1 \in V^*$ indeed. Namely $\psi_1: v \mapsto \langle f(v),w \rangle$ and $w \in W$ is fixed. However note that $\psi_1$ uses an inner product on $W$. EDIT: Note that rk$(\theta) = 1$, so we have dim$\big($ker$(\theta)\big) = $ dim$(V) - 1$. Which fails my attempted proof. 
Namely take dim$(V) = 1$. So that, ker$(\theta)$ = $\{0\}$. And thus for all $0 \neq v \in V$ we have $\psi_1 \neq \psi_2$. Try 2: the same as Try 1 but with $v = x$. I'm assuming that the argument can be proven by a less cumbersome method. Also I think that my method is not correct, since I seem to get stuck. Suggestions or an alternative method are welcome. EDIT: Here's a summary of Fischer's proof. Define the linear map $\lambda: W \to V^*$ by $$\lambda(w) = \langle \cdot, w \rangle_W \circ f.$$ Next define the isomorphism $\sigma: V \to V^*$ by $$\sigma(v_0) = \langle \cdot, v_0 \rangle_V.$$ Now, consider the composition $$\varphi: \sigma^{-1} \circ \lambda: W \to V.$$ We then have $$\langle v, \varphi(w) \rangle_V = \langle f(v), w \rangle_W$$ for all $v \in V, w \in W$. We can now define $f^*:= \varphi$. This proves the theorem for the existence part. For uniqueness, assume that $\psi$ satisfies $\langle f(v),w \rangle_W = \langle v, \psi(w) \rangle_V$. Fixing $w_0 \in W$, we get $$\langle v,\psi(w_0) - f^*(w_0) \rangle_V = 0$$ for all $v \in V$. Choosing $v = \psi(w_0) - f^*(w_0)$ we get $\psi = f^*$, which proves the uniqueness part.",['linear-algebra']

589522,Definition of the principal symbol of a differential operator on a real vector bundle.,"I'm trying to understand the construction of the dirac operator on a manifold, but actually I guess that doesn't really matter for the question at stake. I'm interested in understanding a definition of the principal symbol. Specifically, In Lawson and Michelsohn's Spin Geometry page 113 it says: Recall that the principal symbol of a differential operator $D:\Gamma (E) \to \Gamma (E)$ is a map which associates to each point $x \in X $ and each cotangent vector $\xi \in T^*_x(X)$ , a linear map $\sigma _{\xi}(D):E_x \to E_x$ defined as follows. If in local coordinates we have $$ D=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}A_{\alpha}(x)\frac{\partial ^{|\alpha|}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \text{ and } \xi=\sum_k \xi_k dx_k$$ where m is the order of $D$ , then $$\sigma_{\xi}(D) = i^m \sum_{|\alpha|= m} A_{\alpha}(x)\xi^{\alpha}.$$ After going to the some other chapter you find out that $E$ is a complex vector bundle over $X$ , a riemannian manifold, with a local trivialization $E|_U\to U \times \mathbb{C}^q$ and $A_{\alpha}(x)$ is a $q\times q$ -matrix of smooth complex-valued functions. So the question I have is if one is working with real vector bundles how does one define the principal symbol. I mean, if now one has that $A_{\alpha}(x)$ is a $q\times q$ -matrix of smooth real-valued functions, how do you define the linear map $\sigma _{\xi}(D):E_x \to E_x$ , because just taking the "" $i^m$ "" factor off from the definition seems quite arbitrary.

589540,Does $ \sqrt[n]{\left\lvert \sin(2^n) \right\rvert} $ have a limit?,"The entire question is essentially given in the title: For $ n $ a positive integer, does the sequence $ x_n = \sqrt[n]{\left\lvert \sin(2^n) \right\rvert} $ have a limit as $ n \to \infty $? Background: One of the questions in a recent batch of homework I marked was to investigate the convergence or divergence of the infinite series
$$
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2^n)}{2^n} \, .
$$
Obviously, this series absolutely converges by comparison since
$$
  \left\lvert \frac{\sin(2^n)}{2^n} \right\rvert \leq \frac{1}{2^n} \, ,
$$
and $ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} $ is a convergent geometric series, with common ratio $ r = \frac{1}{2} $.  This is the the solution provided in the solution sheet, and essentially the way most people solved the question. However, one script attempted to use the root test to determine whether or not the series converged.  So, let $ a_n = \frac{\sin(2^n)}{2^n} $, then one needs to determine the limit as $ n \to \infty $ of
$$
  \sqrt[n]{\left\lvert a_n \right\rvert} = \sqrt[n]{\left\lvert \frac{\sin(2^n)}{2^n} \right\rvert} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt[n]{ \left\lvert \sin(2^n) \right\rvert } \, ,
$$
which brings me to the question in the title.  Does the sequence $ x_n = \sqrt[n]{ \left\rvert \sin(2^n) \right\rvert } $ have a limit, or not? I can't convince myself either way, whether this sequence has a limit or not.  Since there is a much better way of determining the convergence of the given infinite series, it wasn't worth spending too much time figuring out whether or not this solution worked.  But I am still curious about it, so can anyone resolve this question for me, one way or the other? Thoughts: If it were $ f(x) = \sqrt[x]{ \left\lvert \sin(2^x) \right\rvert } $, with $ x > 0 $, then I can easily see $ \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) $ does not exist.  Just look at the subsequences $ f(\log_2(n\pi)) = 0 $, and $ f(\log_2(n\pi + \frac{1}{2}\pi)) = 1 $, which have limits $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ respectively, as $ n \to \infty $. Restricting to $ x_n = f(n) $, $ n $ a positive integer, seems a much more difficult question.  My instinctive reaction is to say $ \sin(2^n) $ is such a 'chaotic'/badly behaved sequence, that $ x_n $ can't possibly have a limit.  But this is nowhere near a proof, and I can't justify it to myself any better than this.  On the other hand, some numerical computations with Maple suggest the sequence might be approaching the limit $ 1 $. I guess the question of whether this sequence has a limit is tied strongly to how close $ 2^n $ gets to a rational multiple of $ \pi $, putting us in the realm of Diophantine approximation (about which I know little).  More specifically, what bounds in terms of $ n $ can be put on the difference $ \left\lvert 2^n - b \pi \right\rvert $.  In this vein, I have been told that the function $ \sin(2^n) $ is dense in $ [0,1] $, and that this is not obvious.  But by itself I don't think this is enough to conclude one way or another.  Heuristically: depending on how soon $ \sin(2^n) $ gets close to 0, the $ n $-th root may be enough to force this close to 1 anyway.","['diophantine-approximation', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

589731,Question about proof regarding a triangle and a line.,"RFC: I am wondering if my reasoning below works. Prove: In a plane, if a line intersects a triangle at a point not a vertex, then it must intersect at least one other side of the triangle. Let us assume a line intersecting one side of a triangle does not intersect any other side of the triangle. Let there be a (triangle)ABC and a line L that intersects the triangle at point P. Let P be between (segment)AB. The points A and B separate a plane into two half planes H1 and H2. From the definition of a triangle, one point is non-collinear with the other two points that make the triangle. Thus, point C will lie in either H1 or H2. Since A-P-B (P is between A and B) with P on L, there is at least one point of L in the interior of (triangle)ABC. From the definition of a triangle, the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the length of its sides. Since a perimeter can not be infinite it must be finite and subsequently the length of the sides must be finite. A line has no finite length by definition as that would be a segment. Therefore line L may have a segment from point P longer than the sum of the legs of the triangle. Placing this segment on the same half plane as point C of the triangle, the endpoint opposite P will not lie in the interior of the triangle ABC. With one side of the segment lying in the interior of triangle ABC and the other outside the interior we contradict our assertion that the line L does not intersect another leg of the triangle ABC. Therefore, a line through one side of a triangle must intersect at least one other leg.",['geometry']

589865,Variance of an unbiased estimator of central moments,"Some days ago I asked this question: Unbiased estimators for the moments of 2 non-independent random variables Now, using the same framework employed for the previous question, I'm facing with the problem of estimating the statistical variance of one of these unbiased estimator. Honestly, in this case I'm not sure about how to proceed. Anyway, I started with the following thoughts: I observe random variables $X$ and $Y$ over time. I collect $N$ couples of realizations $(X_i, Y_i)$ , where $i$ denotes the time. Using the notation used by wolfies in its answer, I estimate $E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$ using this formula: $$ h_{1,1} = \frac{N s_{1,1} - s_{1,0}s_{0,1}}{N(N-1)}$$ where $$s_{1,0} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}X_i,~ s_{0,1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}Y_i,~ s_{1,1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}X_iY_i $$ This is the crucial point. I pose: $$Z_i = \frac{NX_iY_i - X_iY_i}{N-1 }$$ In practice, I substitute $s_{1,0}$ with $X_i$ , $s_{0,1}$ with $Y_i$ and $s_{1,1}$ with $X_iY_i$ .
In this way, I obtain a new sample dataset, formed by $Z_i$ , and I say that: $$h_{1,1} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Z_i$$ and the variance is: $$\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (Z_i - h_{1,1})^2$$ Is this correct?","['statistics', 'probability']"

589916,Can you explain the solution of this geometric problem,"A year ago IBM research posted an interesting geometrical problem: A gardener plants a tree on every integer lattice point, except the origin, inside a circle with a radius of $9801$ . The trees are cylindrical in shape and all grow together at the same rate.
As the trees grow, more and more points outside the circle of trees stop having a direct line of sight with the origin. What will be the trees' radius when the origin first loses its line of sight with all the points outside the circle? Please give your answer as a decimal number with an accuracy of $13$ digits ( $13$ significant digits).
Here is a sketch of a forest of radius $5$ and a light beam entering the origin (center of the forest). http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/wwwr_ponder.nsf/challenges/November2012.html I think I know how to solve it using a computer program, but that's not what I want. Basically, I want a ""pure reasoning"" solution. I spent a couple of days trying to solve this problem and eventually I took a look at the solution. The problem is I didn't get it. Actually I still don't get it. Could anyone baby step me through it? The solution: The answer is $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{(d)}}$ , where $d$ is the smallest integer satisfying $d=a^2+b^2$ , where $a$ is co-prime to $b$ , and $d\ge R^2$ . Clearly, $d\le R^2+1$ by choosing $a=R$ and $b=1$ ; and $d$ can be $R^2$ if and only if all the prime factors of $R$ are $1\ \mathrm{modulo} \ 4$ .
In our case, $R=9801=3^4*11^2$ , so the critical radius is $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{(R^2+1)}}$ which is $0.000102030404529629...$ Thanks.","['geometry', 'circles', 'problem-solving']"

Show that $f^r$ is bijective with $\mathbb{R}$ through $F(f^r)=r$ and conclude that there are uncountable non intersecting paths. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $A$ intersects all of the paths $f^r$ and deduce that $A$ must be uncountable (since it must intersect every $f^r$ at a different point). Contradiction!

590121,Is it necessary to use the axiom of Regularity to prove the successor function being injective?,"Basically the problem is that given an inductive set $X$ we can define the successor function on $X$ such that $S:X\longrightarrow X$ and for all $x\in X$, $S(x)=x\cup \{x\}$. So, one of Peano axioms says that such a function is injective on $\omega$. My attempt in trying to prove that $S$ is injective uses the axiom of regularity: Let's suppose that for some $x$ and $y$ in $X$ we have $S(x)=S(y)$, meaning $x\cup \{x\}=y\cup \{y\}$. As $x\in x\cup \{x\}$ then $x\in y$ or else $x=y$. If $x=y$ then $S$ is injective. If $x\in y$ but $x\neq y$ then since $y\in y\cup \{y\} $ and $y\cup \{y\}=x\cup \{x\}$, so $y\in x$. Then $x\in y$ and $y\in x$, which is a contradiction. Therefore $S$ is injective. Another attempt that I'm trying is by means of induction since $X$ is inductive but till now the only thing that comes to my mind is using the same argument. How can I prove it without using the axiom of regularity? Is it possible?","['natural-numbers', 'axioms', 'elementary-set-theory']"
