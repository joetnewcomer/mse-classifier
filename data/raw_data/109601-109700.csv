1579691,How do you evaluate this sum of multiplied binomial coefficients: $\sum_{r=2}^9 \binom{r}{2} \binom{12-r}{3} $?,"We have to find the value of x+y in: $$\sum_{r=2}^9 \binom{r}{2} \binom{12-r}{3} = \binom{x}{y} $$ My approach: I figured that the required summation is nothing but the coefficient of $x^3$ is the following expression: $$\sum_{r=1}^7 \frac{r(r+1)}{2}(1+x)^{10-r} $$ which looks like: $$(1+x)^{10} + 3(1+x)^9 + 6(1+x)^8 + ..... + 36(1+x)^3$$ Hence we have a sequence in which the difference of the coefficients forms an AP. So let the expression = $S$ So we have: $$\frac {S}{1+x} = (1+x)^{9} + 3(1+x)^8 + 6(1+x)^7 + ..... + 36(1+x)^2$$ Subtracting $\frac{S}{1+x}$ from $S$, we get: $$S(1-\frac{1}{1+x}) = (1+x)^{10} + 2(1+x)^9 + 3(1+x)^8 + ..... + 8(1+x)^3 - 36(1+x)^2$$ Here, all the terms except the last one are in AGP and hence we can find $S$ by applying the same method and isolating $S$ on one side. Then we can process to find the coefficient of $x^3$ but it got really lengthy. In the test that it was given, we have an average time of 3 minutes per question and not even the hardest question takes more than 7-8 minutes if you know how to do it. Hence, I'm wondering if there is a better, shorter way to solve this question.","['binomial-coefficients', 'algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'sequences-and-series', 'linear-algebra']"

Then we plug this into the differential equation $2 a x + b + a = \sqrt (a x^2 + b x + c)$. I assume that $b = 2 \sqrt a \sqrt c$ So that i can simplify the RHS. Therefore $2 a x + a + 2 \sqrt a \sqrt c = \sqrt a x + \sqrt c$. When i solve this system of equations i get $a= c = 0$

1579763,How to guarantee differentiability?,"According to my calculus book the following holds. Given that $h\to0$: $f'(x)=\frac{1}{2}(f'(x)+f'(x))=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}+\frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h})=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$ But then the book claims that the existence of the limit in $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$ does not guarantee that $f$ is differentiable at $x$. This can be shown by taking $f(x)=|x|$ at $x=0$. Then the limit gives $0$, while $f'(0)$ should be not defined at $x=0$. Question: Although I can follow the example with $f(x)=|x|$ above, I do not understand why the existence of the limit in $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$ would not guarantee that $f$ is differentiable at $x$. It seems to say that $f'(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$, then why doesn't it also guarantee that $f$ is differentiable at $x$? Any thoughts?","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

  can do this by looking at the numerator as a polynomial in $c$,meaning
  let $a$ and $b$ be constants and $c$ be a variable,or
  $$f(c)=bc(b-c)-ac(a-c)+ab(a-b)-(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)$$ Since $f(c)$ is a quadratic equation ,if we can show that this
  quadratic has $3$ different roots,then $f(c)=0$ for all $c$. The proof ends up with showing that $f(a)=0$,$f(b)=0$ and $f(0)=0$. Now,while I can understand why a quadratic with $3$ roots is the zero polynomial I can't understand why we can treat the numerator as a polynomial and so treat $a,b$ as constants while $c$ as a variable. Furthermore when we let it be a polynomial we also let $c=a=b$ but the problem in the beginning states that ${a,b,c}$ is all sets of distinct nonzero numbers,so I thought that we can't let $c=a=b$ by definition.

1579987,"""Global"" dimension for topological spaces // Geometric interpretation for global dimension of rings","The global dimension of a ring $R$ is the supremum of the projective dimensions of it's $R$-modules. $$\dim (R)=\sup \{\dim_\mathrm{proj}(M):M \in R\text{-mod} \}$$ I'd like to have some geometric picture for the meaning of this number. If $R$ is noetherian we have that ""projective"", ""locally-free"", and ""flat"" are all equivalent. Any module over $R$ can be considered as a sheaf of$\mathcal{O}_S$-modules where $S=\operatorname{Spec} R$. A projective resolution of a module $M$ could be thought of as fitting $M$ into the end of an exact complex of vector bundles (locally-free sheaves) over $S$. This suggests the following story for arbitrary (paracompact hausdorff) topological spaces. Definition 1: An $(r,k)$- resolution for a vector bundle morphism $f: E_0 \to F_0$ is an exact complex of vector bundles: $$0 \to E_r \to \cdots \to E_{2} \to E_{1} \to E_0 \to F_0 \to F_1 \to F_2 \to \cdots \to F_k \to 0$$ Definition 2: The left dimension a morphism $f: E_0 \to F_0$ is the infimum over all lengths of resolutions: $$\dim_{\leftarrow} (f) = \inf \{n : f \text{ has an $(n,k)$-reolution for some $k\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$} \}$$

1579998,Fractals using just modulo operation,"Let us calculate the remainder after division of $27$ by $10$. $27 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$ We have $7$. So let's calculate the remainder after divison of $27$ by $7$. $ 27 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$ Ok, so let us continue with $6$ as the divisor... $ 27 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ Getting closer... $ 27 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ Good! We have finally reached $0$ which means we are unable to continue the procedure. Let's make a function that counts the modulo operations we need to perform until we finally arrive at $0$. So we find some remainder $r_{1}$ after division of some $a$ by some $b$, then we find some remainder $r_{2}$ after division of $a$ by $r_{1}$ and we repeat the procedure until we find such index $i$ that $r_{i} = 0$. Therefore, let $$ M(a, b) = i-1$$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}, b \neq 0 $
(I like to call it ""modulity of a by b"", thence M ) For our example: $M(27, 10) = 3$. Notice that $M(a, b) = 0 \Leftrightarrow  b|a $ (this is why $i-1$ feels nicer to me than just $i$) Recall what happens if we put a white pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $y|x$: This is also the plot of $M(x, y) = 0$.
(the image is reflected over x and y axes for aesthetic reasons. $(0, 0)$ is exactly in the center) What we see here is the common divisor plot that's already been studied extensively by prime number researchers. Now here's where things start getting interesting: What if we put a pixel at such $(x, y)$ that $M(x, y) = 1$? Looks almost like the divisor plot ... but get a closer look at the rays. It's like copies of the divisor plot are growing on each of the original line! How about $M(x, y) = 2$? Copies are growing on the copies!
Note that I do not overlay any of the images, I just follow this single equation. Now here is my favorite.
Let us determine luminosity ($0 - 255$) of a pixel at $(x, y)$ by the following equation:
$$255 \over{ M(x,y) + 1 }$$
(it is therefore full white whenever $y$ divides $x$, half-white if $M(x, y) = 1$ and so on) The full resolution version is around ~35 mb so I couldn't upload it here  (I totally recommend seeing this in 1:1): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_gBQSJQBKcjakVSZG1KUVVoTmM/view?usp=sharing What strikes me the most is that some black stripes appear in the gray area and they most often represent prime number locations. Trivia The above plot with and without prime numbers marked with red stripes: https://i.sstatic.net/FT3JA.jpg https://i.sstatic.net/kSrNB.png The above plot considering only prime $x$: Formula: $255 \over{ M(p_{x},y) }$ (note I do not add $1$ to the denominator because it would be full white only at $y$ equal $1$ or the prime. Therefore, the pixel is fully white when $p_{x}$ mod $y = 1$ ) Full 1:1 resolution: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_gBQSJQBKcjTWMzc3ZHWmxERjA/view?usp=sharing Interestingly, these modulities form a divisor plot of their own. Notice that for $ M(a, b) = i-1, r_{i-1}$ results in either $1$ or a divisor of $a$ (which is neither $1$ nor $a$). I put a white pixel at such $(x, y)$ that for $M(x, y) = i - 1$, it is true that $r_{i-1}\neq 1 \wedge r_{i-1} | x$ (the one before last iteration results in a remainder that divides $x$ and is not $1$ (the uninteresting case)) https://i.sstatic.net/9Ml5s.png It is worth our notice that growth of $M(a, b)$ is rather slow and so if we could discover a rule by which to describe a suitable $b$ that most often leads to encountering a proper factor of $a$, we would discover a primality test that works really fast (it'd be $O(M(a, b))$ because we'd just need to calculate this $r_{i-1}$). Think of $M'(a, b)$ as a function that does not calculate $a$ mod $b$ but instead does $M(a, b)$ until a zero is found.
These two are plots of $M'''(x, y)$ with and without primes marked: https://i.sstatic.net/yfOyY.png https://i.sstatic.net/dagbd.png Plot of $M(x, 11)$, enlarged 5 times vertically: https://i.sstatic.net/ykb3B.png Can't notice any periodicity in the first 1920 values even though it's just 11. For comparison, plot of $x$ mod $11$ (1:1 scale): https://i.sstatic.net/viKAU.png As it's been pointed out in the comments, subsequent iterations of $M(a, b)$ look very much like Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisors using repeated modulo. A strikingly similar result can be obtained if for $(x, y)$ we plot the number of steps of $gcd(x, y)$: I've also found similar picture on wikipedia : This is basically the plot of algorithmic efficiency of $gcd$. Somebody even drew a density plot here on stackexchange . The primes, however, are not so clearly visible in GCD plots . Overall, they seem more orderly and stripes do not align vertically like they do when we use $M(a, b)$ instead. Here's a convenient comparative animation between GCD timer (complexity plot) and my Modulity function ($M(x, y)$). Best viewed in 1:1 zoom. $M(x, y)$ appears to be different in nature from Euclid's GCD algorithm. Questions Where is $M(a, b)$ used in mathematics? Is it already named somehow? How could one estimate growth of $M(a, b)$ with relation to both $a$ and $b$, or with just $a$ increasing?

1580023,Examples of group-theoretic results more easily obtained through topology or geometry,"Earlier, I was looking at a question here about the abelianization of a certain group $X$. Since $X$ was the fundamental group of a closed surface $\Sigma$, it was easy to compute $X^{ab}$ as $\pi_1(\Sigma)^{ab} = H_1(\Sigma)$, then use the usual machinery to compute $H_1(\Sigma)$. That made me curious about other compelling examples of solving purely (for some definition of 'purely') algebraic questions that are accessible via topology or geometry. The best example I can think of the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which is certainly provable directly but has a very short proof by recasting the problem in terms of the fundamental group of a wedge product of circles. Continuing this line of reasoning leads to things like graphs of groups, HNN-extensions, and other bits of geometric group theory. What are some other examples, at any level, of ostensibly purely group-theoretic results that have compelling, shorter topological proofs?

1580598,How to get the SVD of $2AA^T-\operatorname{diag}(AA^T)$ given $A$ and its SVD $A=USV^T$?,"Given a matrix $A\in R^{n\times d}$ with $n>d$, and we can have some fast ways to (approximately) calculate the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of $A$, saying $A=USV^T$ and $V\in R^{d\times d}$. It is straightforward to know that the SVD of $2AA^T$ is $U(2SS)V^T$, that is to say the SVD of  $2AA^T$ requires $O(nd^2)$ time similar to that of $A$. However,  to get the SVD of $2AA^T-\operatorname{diag}(AA^T)\in R^{n\times n}$ where $\operatorname{diag}(AA^T)$ is a square diagonal matrix who only has the diagonal elements of $AA^T$ in its diagonal, if running SVD directly on $2AA^T-\operatorname{diag}(AA^T)$, we might need $O(n^3)$ time. My question is, do you have any method or equation to use $A$ and its SVD $USV^T$ to indirectly get the SVD of  $2AA^T-\operatorname{diag}(AA^T)$?

Counting is not my forte so I was hoping you could check over my work, make sure my end result is correct and my explanation is sufficient. Any help is appreciated! Below is the question followed by my attempt. Let $X = \{1, 2,... , 10\}$. Define the relation $\mathcal R$ on $X$ by:
 For all $a,b ∈ X, a\mathcal Rb$ if and only if $ab$ is even. (a) Find and simplify the number of two-element subsets $S$ of $X$ that satisfy the following property: $∀a ∈ S, a\mathcal R1$. Explain. First I let $T$ be the set of all $x \in X$ so that $a \mathcal R 1$. Then $T= \{2,4,6,8,10\}$ so then the question becomes, how many two element subsets of S are there, which would be ${5\choose2}=10$ (b) Find the number of subsets $S$ of $X$ (of any size) that satisfy the following property: $∀a \in S, ∃b∈S$ so that $a\mathcal Rb$. Explain. Let $x,y \in \mathbb Z$. Then we have the following properties: If $x,y$ odd then $xy$ is odd. If $x,y$ even then $xy$ is even. If $x$ odd and $y$ even then $xy$ even. So for a set to satisfy the property above it must contain at least one even number. To get this I will calculate the total number of subsets of $X$ and subtract the number of subsets of $X$ which contain only odd numbers (that is, the number of subsets of $\{1,3,5,7,9\}$). So then the answer should be $2^{10}-2^5=992$ For part (b) I have counted the empty set in my final answer but I'm unsure if it would actually satisfy the property..","['combinatorics', 'relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1580623,Finding Symmetry Group $S_3$ in a function,"I was considering functions $f: \Bbb{C} \rightarrow \Bbb{C}$ and I defined the following instrument (I call it the Symmetry Group of a function) $$ \text{Sym}(f) = \left< m(x)|f(m(x))=f(x) \right> $$ An intuitive example is to consider $\text{Sym}(e^x)$ and observe that $$m(x) = x + 2i \pi $$ 
has the property that $$ e^{m(x)} = e^{x+2i\pi}=e^x e^{2i \pi} = e^x $$ And the group generated by $m(x)$ under composition is the set of functions $$ x + 2i\pi k, k \in \Bbb{Z}$$ Which is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}$ under function composition. So one can then say that $$\text{Sym}(e^x) \cong \Bbb{Z}$$ What I was curious about was if there are any elementary functions such that $$ \text{Sym}(g(x)) \cong S_3$$ In attempt to build one I considered $$ g(x) = x^{\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}} +  x^{\left( {\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}}\right)^2} + x + \frac{1}{x} +x^{-\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}}+  x^{-\left({\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}}\right)^2} $$ G has as a generator for its symmetries the functions $L_1 = \frac{1}{x}$ and $L_2 =  x^{\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}}$ Which can be observed as $$G(L_1) = G(L_2) = G(x)$$ But the problem is that $L_1(L_2) = L_2(L_1)$ so clearly this isn't a generating set for $S_3$. It's not obvious at this point, how to go about making a function that has $S_3$ as its underlying symmetry group Some Examples: $\Bbb{Z}_2$ can be realized as $\text{Sym}\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)$ as this function is invariant under the substitutions $x \rightarrow x$ and $x\rightarrow \frac{1}{x}$ The proof arises from the following: Suppose we wish to find all transformations $T$ $x$ such that $$ x + \frac{1}{x} = T(x) + \frac{1}{T(x)}$$ We can the derive that $$ T(x)^2 - \left(x+ \frac{1}{x}\right)T(x) + 1 = 0$$ Which yields that $$ T(x) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x} \pm \sqrt{x^2+2+\frac{2}{x^2}-4}}{2}$$ simplifying to $$ T(x)  = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x} \pm (x-\frac{1}{x})}{2}$$ and that gives $T(x) = x, T(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ observe the these transformations form a group of order $2$ so they must be isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_2$ And in general I conjecture that: $\Bbb{Z}_n$ can be realized as $$\text{Sym} \left( x + x^{\sqrt[n]{1}_1} + x^{\sqrt[n]{1}_2} + ... x^{\sqrt[n]{1}_{n-1}}\right)$$","['functional-equations', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'complex-analysis', 'group-theory']"
1580629,Hamel basis for $\mathbb R$ over the field $\mathbb Q$,"A set $S\subseteq\mathbb R$ is said to be linearly independent if for distinct $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ ($k\in\mathbb N$) and for integers $n_1,\ldots,n_k$, $$n_1x_1+\ldots+ n_kx_k=0$$ implies that $$n_1=\ldots=n_k=0.$$
It is not difficult to see that this definition is equivalent to the one in which $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ are allowed to be rationals. By Zorn’s lemma, there exists a maximal such linearly independent $S$, which is a Hamel basis for $\mathbb R$ over $\mathbb Q$. Now, Problem 14.7 in Billingsley’s Probability and Measure (1995) claims that [E]ach real $x$ can be written uniquely as $x=n_1x_1+\cdots+n_kx_k$ for distinct points $x_i$ in $S$ and integers $n_i$. [emphasis added] I think this is not right: (1) In the above definition of linear independence, integers and rationals are interchangeable, but...
(2) ...in the Hamel-basis representation, rationals must be allowed. Integer coordinates are not enough to represent all of $\mathbb R$ for any maximal linear independent $S$. I wonder if someone could confirm this is a typo. Thank you. Here is a proof sketch for why integers are not sufficient. Let $x\in S$. Now, if Billingsley’s claim were true, it would be the case that $$\frac{x}{2}=\sum_{i=1}^kn_ix_i$$ for distinct $x_i\in S$ and integers $n_i$. But then $$x-2n_1x_1-\ldots-2n_kx_k=0.$$ Because of linear independence, $x$ must coincide with some other $x_i$. Since the $x_i$’s are distinct, there must be precisely one such $x_i$. Then, by matching the coefficients, it must be the case that $$1-2n_i=0,$$ or $n_i=1/2$, which is not an integer.","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

Differentiating the function will give its slope. Since slope is defined as the rate of change, then getting the maxima of the function's derivative will indicate where it is increasing at the greatest rate. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $\frac{22000x}{(11+x^2)^2}$ Applying the first derivative test, the critical number is $\sqrt{\frac{11}{3}}$. The function increases before the critical number and decreases after it, so the critical number is a maximum. $\sqrt{\frac{11}{3}}$ is the answer.","['proof-verification', 'calculus', 'functions']"

I understand the standard proof by contradiction, where the contradiction is that $a, b$ are not coprimes when you represent $$\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b},$$ but I attempted a different way and want to see if it is acceptable or not (I'm assuming the latter case). So, Assume $\sqrt{p}$ as a rational number then, $\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ coprimes $p = {\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)}^{2}$ Now, since $p$ is a prime number, then the only way to represent $p$ as a rational number is by $p = \frac{p}{1}$. So, $a = p$ and $b = 1$. So, we have $p = \frac{p^2}{1^2}$ $p = p^2$, Contradiction. It follows that $\sqrt{p}$ cannot be rational (i.e., $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational). QED. Is this acceptable?

1580771,Does the sum of weights in Kirchhoff’s construction equal the Gram determinant?,"Background: An electrical network is modeled by a complex. Branch current distributions $\mathbf I\in C_1$ are represented by $1$-chains; branch voltage drop distributions $\mathbf V\in C^1$ are $1$-cochains; $\dim C_1=\dim C^1=b$, the number of branches. We define $Z_1=\ker\operatorname{\partial}$ (where $\operatorname{\partial}:C_1\to C_0$ is the boundary operator) as the subspace of cycles; $\dim Z_1=m$, the number of independent meshes in the network. Branch current distributions that satisfy Kirchhoff’s current law, $\operatorname{\partial}\mathbf I=0$ are thus elements of $Z_1$. We establish a basis for $Z_1$ that consists of linearly independent meshes by selecting a maximal tree $T$ for the network. For each branch $\beta\notin T$, there is a unique mesh $\mathbf M_\beta$ that is obtained by adjoining $\beta$ to the maximal tree $T$. Remember that a mesh has coefficients in $\{-1, 0, +1\}$. The orientation of $\mathbf M_\beta$ is chosen so that the coefficient of $\beta$ is $+1$. Then, we define the space $H_1$ as $Z_1$ considered as a vector space in its own right instead of as a subspace of $C_1$. The map $\sigma:H_1\to C_1$ identifies this space with $Z_1$, e.g., if the mesh $\mathbf M\in H_1$ consists of the branch currents $\alpha+\beta-\gamma\in C_1$, then $\sigma(\mathbf M)=\alpha+\beta-\gamma$. The matrix of $\sigma$ relative to this basis has these meshes as its columns. Note that there are $m$ such meshes for a given tree $T$, hence also $m$ non-tree branches. We are given the vector of branch current sources $\mathbf K\in C_1$, voltage sources $\mathbf W\in C^1$ and the map $Z:C_1\to C^1$ that relates branch currents to branch voltages. The matrix of $Z$ relative to the standard bases is the diagonal matrix of branch impedances, which for a resistive network are resistances—positive reals. We must then find $\mathbf I\in C_1$ and $\mathbf V\in C^1$ such that $$
\mathbf V-\mathbf W = Z(\mathbf I-\mathbf K)
$$ and Kirchhoff’s laws $$
\operatorname{\partial}\mathbf I=0 \\
\mathbf V=-\operatorname{d}\mathbf\Phi
$$ are satisfied. (I haven’t defined the zero-cochain $\mathbf\Phi$ or the coboundary operator $\operatorname{d}$ here, but I don’t think they’re directly relevant to my problem.) One way to solve a resistive network is due to Weyl: We can use $Z$ to define a scalar product $\langle\mathbf I,\mathbf I'\rangle_Z = \sum_\alpha z_\alpha I_\alpha I'_\alpha$. If $\pi:C_1\to Z_1$ is the orthogonal projection operator relative to this scalar product, then $\mathbf I=\pi(\mathbf K-Z^{-1}\mathbf W)$ and $\mathbf V=Z(1-\pi)(\mathbf K-Z^{-1}\mathbf W)$ are the solution. Comparing this to the solution obtained via the mesh-current method provides an explicit expression for this operator in terms of $Z$ and $\sigma$:$$
\pi = \sigma(\sigma^*Z\sigma)^{-1}\sigma^*Z. \tag{*}
$$
Kirchhoff’s construction of this orthogonal projection uses a weighted average of a set of (possibly) non-orthogonal projections as follows. Each maximal tree $T$ has an associated projection $\rho_T: C_1\to Z_1$ defined by: $$
\rho_T(\beta) = \begin{cases}
 0, &\text{if }\beta\in T \\ 
 \mathbf M_\beta, &\text{if }\beta\notin T,
 \end{cases}
$$ where $\mathbf M_\beta$ is the mesh associated with the non-tree branch $\beta$. $\sum _T\lambda_T\rho_T$, with $0\le\lambda_T\le1$ and $\sum_T\lambda_T=1$ and summed over all maximal trees, is also a projection of $C_1$ onto $Z_1$. By taking
$$
\lambda_T = \frac{Q_T}R \\
Q_T = \prod_{\beta\notin T}z_\beta \\
R = \sum_TQ_T,
$$ the resulting projection is orthogonal relative to $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_Z$. The Problem: From solving various networks as exercises, it looks to me like $R=\det(\sigma^*Z\sigma)$, the Gram determinant for the chosen basis of $Z_1$ relative to $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_Z$. Since the entries of the matrices for $\sigma$ and $\sigma^*$ are all integers, the only source of non-integer factors in $(*)$ is $Z$. Similarly, $Z$, and hence $\frac1R$ is the only source of non-integer factors in Kirchhoff’s sum. Setting all resistances to integer values makes it obvious that $R\; | \det(\sigma^*Z\sigma)$ or $\det(\sigma^*Z\sigma)\;|\;R$, but I haven’t been able to come up with a proof of equality. I tried expanding the determinant by cofactors and comparing to the the coefficients in Kirchhoff’s sum, but couldn’t get anywhere with that. Perhaps if I had a better idea of how those coefficients were determined, that might do the trick. Hints and suggestions are welcome. Update: The main diagonal elements of $\sigma^*Z\sigma$ are $\sum_\beta z_\beta[\beta\in\mathbf M_\alpha]$ ($[\cdot]$ are Iverson brackets), i.e., the total resistances in each basis mesh, while the off-diagonal elements are $\pm\sum_\gamma z_\gamma[\gamma\in\mathbf M_\alpha][\gamma\in\mathbf M_\beta]$, i.e., the total common resistances of each pair of basis meshes, negative if the meshes have opposite orientation. Using linear combinations of rows/columns of this matrix to isolate the non-tree resistances looks promising.","['graph-theory', 'determinant', 'linear-transformations', 'algebraic-topology', 'linear-algebra']"

\begin{align}E[X_{n+1}\mid \mathcal{F_n}]&=E[X_{n+1}[I(X_{n+1}=\alpha+\beta X_n)+I(X_{n+1}=\beta X_n)]\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]\\&=E[(\alpha+\beta X_n)I(X_{n+1}=\alpha+\beta X_n)+\beta X_nI(X_{n+1}=\beta X_n)\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]\\&=(\alpha+\beta X_n)E[I(X_{n+1}=\alpha+\beta X_n)\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]+\beta X_nE[I(X_{n+1}=\beta X_n)\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]\\&=(\alpha+\beta X_n)P[X_{n+1}=\alpha+\beta X_n\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]+\beta X_nP[X_{n+1}=\beta X_n\:\mid \mathcal{F_n}]\\&=(\alpha+\beta X_n)X_n+\beta X_n(1-X_n)=\alpha X_n+\beta X_n^2+\beta X_n-\beta X_n^2=X_n(\alpha+\beta)\\&=X_n\end{align} So $X_n$ is a martingale.

1580917,Ideal sheaf that defines singular locus,"I am looking for a scheme theoretic definition of the singular locus of a variety over a field $K$ of characteristic zero that carries not only the information of which points are singular, but also in some suitable sense how singular these points are. If we have an affine (irreducible) $K$-variety $X$ of dimendion $d$, we can write it as the spectrum of a finitely generated $K$-algebra $A=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\ldots, f_r)$. Then the singular locus of $X$ is cut out by the ideal $I$ of $A$ generated by the $(n-d) \times (n-d)$ minors of the Jacobian matrix $J=(\partial f_i / \partial x_j)$. Thus we can define the singular locus of $X$ to be the closed subscheme $\textrm{Spec} A/I$ which is not necessarily reduced. Perhaps for an arbitrary variety one can cover by open affines and do this construction locally. So these are my questions: Is this the common way to define the singular locus of a variety as a subscheme? This construction seems to be a bit cumbersome since we first have to choose an embedding to some affine space and also it is not immediately that it does not depend on the choice of the embedding. Is there a better, more intrinsic definition?

$$ It is already surprising that the ugly definiton (2) and not (1) is usually used for $Ei(z)$. Much worser is the fact that both definitions lead to different results upon expanding the functions. For this we use the usual trick (standard branch cut along the negative real semi-axis is assumed, if necessary): $$
Ei(z)=-\int_{-z}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-u}}{u}du
+\int_0^{-z}\frac{1-e^{-u}}{u}du-\int_0^{-z}\frac{1-e^{-u}}{u}du\\
=\left[\left.-e^{-u}\ln u\right|_{-z}^\infty-\int_{-z}^\infty e^{-u}\ln u du\right]+\left[\left.(1-e^{-u})\ln u\right|_0^{-z}-\int_0^{-z}e^{-u}\ln u du\right]+\int_0^z\frac{e^t-1}{t}dt\\
