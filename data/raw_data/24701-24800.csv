219954,A lower bound for Waring's Problem for sufficiently large numbers: $G(k) \ge k+1$,"I need to show that, if $G(k)$ is the solution to Waring's Problem for $k$ and for sufficiently large $n$, then: $$G(k) \ge k + 1$$ So I need to establish that: $$x_1^k + x_2^k + \dots + x_k^k = n \tag{1}$$ fails for an arbitrary number of values. I've a few solutions to this, but they seem outside the scope of the course (4th year Ele.Num.Theory). A hint is that we should use an earlier result that the number of solutions to: $$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k \le n$$ is $$\binom{n + k}{n}$$ I don't see how I can establish the result given this information. Maybe there's a better way?","['additive-combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
219993,Recovering a finite group's structure from the order of its elements.,"Suppose you know the following two things about a group $G$ with $n$ elements: the order of each of the $n$ elements in $G$; $G$ is uniquely determined by the orders in (1). Question: How difficult is it to recover the group structure of $G$? In other words, what is the best way to use this information to construct a Cayley table for $G$? Note: (1) alone is not enough to uniquely determine a group. See this MO post for more. Information about identifying when (1) implies (2) would be welcomed as well.","['computational-algebra', 'abelian-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
220044,Any example of manifold without global trivialization of tangent bundle,"It is said for most manifolds, there does not exist a global trivialization of the tangent bundle. I am not quite clear about it. The tangent bundle is defined as $$TM=\bigsqcup_{p\in M}T_PM$$ So is the above statement saying that generally
$$
\bigsqcup_{p\in M}T_PM\neq M\times\mathbb{R}^n?
$$ But I think the tangent space is just attaching a $\mathbb{R}^n$ to every point on $M$, so I wonder what's the reason for it is not a product space? Plus, when defining trivialization, we have a lot of constraint on the function $F:TM\rightarrow M\times V$, can anyone explain the necessity of those constraint? At last, does $S^2$ has a global trivialization? Update: Following is my attempt to trivialize $S^2$, but meet some problem. I think it may reflect some aspect in the impossibility to trivialization of $S^2$, isn't it? We want to define trivialization $F:TS^2\rightarrow S^2\times \mathbb{R}^2$. First of all, $F$ should be well-defined. There are 3 different approach to define a tangent space, here I take the definition via chart. So, an element in $TS^2$ is $\left[(p, v, (U,\varphi))\right]$, and of course I try to define its image to be $(p, v)$. Then the problem comes. Because we need at least 2 chart to cover $S^2$, so when taking another representative $(p, w, (V,\phi))$ of the equivalent class $\left[(p, v, (U,\varphi))\right]$, we map it to $(p, w)$, which conflicts the previous image. Of course it is only one attempt, but I think it may reflect some difficulty to define $F$ because it need to preserve coordinate transformation. Right? Eh.. I realized my attempt is too trivial. If I apply this method to any manifold, $F$ is never well-define... Can anyone provide an manifold which can be trivialize? I think I may use it to get better understanding.","['manifolds', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
220052,Partition of a set of size n into subsets of size 1 and 2.,"Before I ask the question, I must admit that combinatorics has never been my forte. I am given a set X of size $n$, we may assume assume $X=\{1,2,...,n\}$. I want to count the partition of this set into subsets of size either 1 or 2. Let's denote the set of such partitions by $T_{n}$. I can find a recurrence equation for $|T_{n}|$. If I take one such partition, then the element $n$ must be in a subset of either size 2 or 1: let $R_{2}$ be the set of partitions in $T_{n}$ where $n$ is in a subset of size 2, and let $R_{1}$ be the set of partitions in $T_{n}$ where $n$ is in a subset of size 1. Then $R_{1}\cup R_{2}=T_{n}$ and their intersection is empty, so $|R_{1}|+ |R_{2}|=|T_{n}|$. In fact $R_{1}$ is simply $T_{n-1}$ and $R_{2}$ is $(n-1)T_{n-2}$ (as I have $n-1$ choices for the element in the same subset in which $n$ lies and then I can partition the remaining $n-2$ elements in $|T_{n-2}|$ ways). So $|T_{n}|=(n-1)|T_{n-1}|+|T_{n-2}|$. This recurrence relation seems to work (in a very heuristic way, I have checked it for few $n$'s), but I am not sure it is right. I can construct a bijection between $T_{n}$ and the set $U_{n}$ of elements of the symmetric group $S_{n}$  with cycles types which are a sequence of 2's and 1's. For example, I tried to calculate $|U_{6}|$ as follows: I have a single choice for the permutation of cycle type $(1,1,1,1,1,1)$, $\frac{6!}{2*5!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,1,1,1,1)$, $\frac{6!}{4*4!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,2,1,1)$, and $\frac{6!}{8*3!}$ for the permutation with cycle type $(2,2,2)$ but this gives me $26.5$. The questions are: Is my recurrence relation correct? Where is my error in counting the elements of $U_{6}$? Thank you so much in advance and I hope the questions are clear. Erratum : I mis-wrote the recurrence relation, it should read $|T_{n}|=(n-1)|T_{n-2}|+|T_{n-1}|$.","['set-partition', 'combinatorics']"

Show that for any sequence of numbers $\{a_{n}\}$, with $\sum_{n}|a_{n}|^{2}<\infty$ and $\sum_{n}a_{n}f_{n}=0$ then $a_{n}=0$ for all $n$. I tried the following:
 Let $\{a_{n}\}$ be a sequence, with $\sum_{n}|a_{n}|^{2}<\infty$ and $\sum_{n}a_{n}f_{n}=0$. Then pick any $f_{m}$, and take inner product with the sum:
$$0=\langle f_{m}, \sum_{n}a_{n}f_{n} \rangle= \sum_{n}a_{n}\langle f_{m}, f_{n} \rangle=a_{m}\langle f_{m}, f_{m} \rangle $$
wich implies that $a_{m}=0$ for all $m$. But I'm a little worry about taking the sum out the inner product, it is like interchanging order of sum and integral, since $$\langle f_{m}, \sum_{n}a_{n}f_{n} \rangle= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{n}a_{n}f_{m}(x)f_{n}(x)dx=\sum_{n}a_{n} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{m}(x)f_{n}(x)dx=\sum_{n}a_{n} \langle f_{m}, f_{n} \rangle $$ Did I miss anything?

Thanks: Claim 4: Let $R$ be a binary relation on a set $X$, and suppose $\langle Y, \prec \rangle$ is a strict w.o. If there exists a function $rk : X \to Y$ such that $$ \forall x, y \in X (x \neq y \land \langle x, y \rangle \in R \to rk(x) \prec rk(y)), \tag{*}$$ then the relation $R$ is wellfounded. where we use the following definition of wellfounded: $\newcommand{\pair}[2]{\langle#1,#2\rangle}$ Definition 3: Let $R$ be a binary relation on a set $X$. We say that $R$ is wellfounded ,
  if for every nonempty subset $Y \subseteq X$ there exists a $z \in Y$ such that
  $\pair yz \notin R$  for all $y \in Y\setminus \{z\}$. A relation $R$ is strictly wellfounded if it is wellfounded
  and irreflexive. Proof: Assume $R$ is not well-founded. Then there exists an infinite $R$-descending sequence $(x_n)$ such that $(x_{n+1}, x_n) \in R$, $n \in \mathbb N$, so that $S = \{x_n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}$ does not have an $R$-minimal element. Then $f(S)$ is a subset of $Y$ containing an infinite $R$-descending sequence $(f(x_{n+1}), f(x_n)) \in \prec$ which is a contradiction to $(Y,\prec)$ being well-founded.","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

220161,Divide circle into 9 pieces of equal area,"I'd like to divide a unit circle disk into nine parts of equal area, using circle arcs as delimiting lines. The whole setup should be symmetric under the symmetry group of the square, i.e. 4 mirror axes and 4-fold rotational symmetry. The dividing arcs should all be of equal curvature. (Thanks to the comment by i. m. soloveichik for making me aware this latter requirement.) For these reasons, several areas will automatically be of the same size, indicated by a common color in the figure above. There are three different colors corresponding to three different shapes, and the requirement that all three of these should have the same area therefore corresponds to two equations. This agrees nicely with the fact that there are two real parameters one may tune, e.g. the distance $d$ between the center of the figure and the centers of the dividing circles, together with the radius $r$ for these dividing circles. Other combinations are possible. But how would one obtain the actual numbers for these parameters? Is the solution even unique?

What I want to know is if I am correct in interpreting the definition of projection map. Let $P:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be the projection map onto A. The question asks me to calculate $P(e_1)$, $P(e_2)$ and $P(e_3)$ then write down the matrix of $P$ with respect to the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Without explicitly giving my answer (I want to check my method, not my answers), this is my method: Write each vector $e_1$, $e_2$ and $e_3$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $\mathscr{C}$, so, for example, $e_1 = \alpha\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}+\beta\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \gamma\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$. For the projection map onto $A$ we take only the first two terms as the first two terms are in the basis $\mathscr{B}$. So, for the combination in step 1, $P(e_1)=\begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \end{pmatrix} = \alpha e_1+\beta e_2+\gamma e_3$ To form the matrix P we write down the columns of the matrix the coefficients describe in the last step, so we get: $P=\begin{pmatrix} \alpha & . & . \\ \beta & . & . \\ \gamma & . & . \end{pmatrix}$, and fill in the missing columns as we did for the first column above.

Property. We know that $f$ is continuous if and only if each $f_{\alpha}$ is continuous, once we are given product topology on $X$. We further know that this property does not generally hold with box topology on $X$. After reviewing the definition, it seems to me that this property seems rather trivial (or natural) since product topology only collects finite intersections of inverse images under projections as open sets. Can someone give more examples outside this property that explains why we prefer product topology?

For each vertex $v\in V$, let $\newcommand{\out}{\mathrm{out}}\delta_\out(v)=\{ e\in E \mid \exists w\in V: e=(v,w)\}$ be the set of outgoing edges. For each edge $e=(v,w)\in E$, let $$p(e):=\frac{1}{\sharp\delta_\out(v)}$$ be the probability of this edge. For each leaf $v\in V_0:=\{ v\in V \mid \sharp\delta_\out(v)=0\}$, there is a unique path from the root to $v$. Let $e_1,\ldots,e_r\in E$ be the edges of this path. Then, we write $$p(v):=\prod_{i=1}^r p(e_i)$$ and call it the probability of this leaf. Problem Description Let $a,b\in\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}\Z$ with $a<0<b$. Consider a decision tree $(V,E)$ whose leaves are labelled with integer values from the interval $[a,b]$. In other words, we have a function $\ell: V_0 \to \Z\cap[a,b]$. Question: Is the sum over all leaf labels equal to zero or not? i.e. decide whether $$\sum_{v\in V_0} \ell(v) = 0$$ or not. Now in my case there are a lot of leaves, way too many to compute $\sum_{v\in V_0} \ell(v)$ explicitly. However, traversing a path from the root to some leaf $v$ and thereby computing $p(v)$ is easy. Now, I was wondering: Is there a method to probabilistically answer the question from a smaller number of samples $v\in V_0$ together with the values $p(v)$ and $\ell(v)$?

221008,problem with proving a property of $n\choose k$,"today, at college, we had the following definition of $n\choose k$: For any set $S=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ containing n elements, the number of distinct k-element subsets of it that can be formed is given by $n\choose k$. Now I've wanted to use the definition to prove ${n-1\choose k}+{n-1\choose k-1}={n\choose k}$ for all $1\leq k<n$ and $n>1$ as an exercise.
I've tried to prove by induction.
So the step $n=2$ is easy. But I have difficulties with $n\rightarrow n+1$. I've tried to split the set $S=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n,a_{n+1}\}$ into subsets: 1) containing $a_{n+1}$ 2) not contaning $a_{n+1}$ The second one is easy, there are $n\choose k$ subsets.

221018,Is $n \sin n$ dense on the real line?,"Is $\{n \sin n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ dense on the real line? If so, is $\{n^p \sin n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ dense for all $p>0$? This seems much harder than showing that $\sin n$ is dense on [-1,1], which is easy to show. EDIT: This seems a bit harder than the following related problem, which might give some insight: When is $\{n^p [ \sqrt{2} n ] | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ dense on the real line, where $[\cdot]$ is the fractional part of the expression? I am thinking that there should be some probabilistic argument for these things. EDIT 2: Ok, so plotting a histogram over $n \sin n$ is similar to plotting
$n \sin(2\pi X)$ where $X$ is a uniform distribution on $[-1,1].$
This is not surprising, since $n$ mod $2\pi$ is distributed uniformly on  $[0,2\pi].$ Now, the pdf of $\sin(2\pi X)$ is given by $f(x)=\frac{2}{\pi \sqrt{1-x^2}}$
in $(-1,1)$ and 0 outside this set. The pdf for $n \sin(2\pi X)$ is $g_n(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{nk} f(x/k)$
so the limit density is what we get when $n \rightarrow \infty.$
(This integrates to 1 over the real line). Now, it should be straightforward to show that for any interval $[a,b],$
$\int_a^b g_n(x) dx \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty.$ Thus, the series $g_n$ is ""too flat"" to be able to accumulate positive probability anywhere. (The gaussian distribution on the other hand, has positive integral on every interval).",['real-analysis']

And yet 2 sections later (3.3 Volume), we actually use absolute values around determinants, which is represented like this: | det(A) |. So if we wanted to compute the determinant of Matrix A as well as have the absolute value of it, it would look like ||A||?

The question is motivated by the following: Suppose that for some analytic function $g(x)$ we have the values of the function at positive integers, so we can write a Taylor development :
$$g(m)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}m^{n}$$
Now suppose that the following summation is convergent in the open unit disk:
$$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}g(m)z^{m}$$
Using the above Taylor expansion, and the definition of the Polylogarithm function, we have:
$$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}g(m)z^{m}=:f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\text{Li}_{-n}(z)\;\;\left | z\right |<1$$
The plan is to recover the coefficients $a_{n}$, and the thus the Taylor expansion of $g(z)$. EDIT: By Ramanujan's master theorem , $g(z)$ is given by:
$$\frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi s)}g(-s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(f(-x)+g(0)\right)x^{s-1}dx\;\;\;\;(0<\Re(s)<1)$$

221285,A variation on the Look and Say Sequence and some questions about it.,"For information on the sequence mentioned in the title, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence . This is an original problem. Suppose instead of ""describing"" the numbers in a string in order, one counts the digits globally and, for convention, lists then in numerical order. That is, whereas in Conway's sequence $21\rightarrow 1211$, in my version, $21\rightarrow 1112$. Starting with the initial string 1, an interesting thing happens at the 13th iteration: we come upon the string $21322314$ which ""describes"" itself. We may think of this as a fixed point in the iteration process. At this point, a distinction needs to be made. I'd like to be able to answer questions about general strings, including those with numbers of more than one digit. That is, I'd like to be able to discuss strings which naturally lead to, say, ten 1's or thirteen 4's. Once a multi-digit number is in a string, we have a choice. We may either respect the integrity of the number or split it into its constituent digits. For example, we may either say ""13 is one 1 and one 3"" or ""13 is one $\underline{13}$."" Call these varations A and B. Here are some questions I've thought about regarding this sequence: Does every string in variations A and B terminate? That is, does the process lead to a fixed point. I have answered this question for A in the affirmative, but not for B. I strongly suspect it holds for B as well. Notice that sometimes strings can terminate in a nontrivial cycle: notationally, $$S_1→S_2→...→S_n→S_1.$$ Call this a cycle of length $n$. (The biggest cycle I've found from experimentation is of length 6). Assuming strings terminate in both A and B and given an arbitrary string $S$, can one put an upper bound on on the cycle length of its eventual fixed point? Further, given an arbitrary string $S$ in A or B, what can one say about the amount of iterations it takes for $S$ to terminate? What about its eventually string length? Suppose we abandon talk of ""strings"" and instead think of the objects as multisets. This is natural given how much multiplicity matters in this discussion. Let $M_\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of multisets with elements in $\mathbb{N}$. Then the process of ""looking and saying"" is a function $J:M_\mathbb{N}\rightarrow M_\mathbb{N}$. Is there a natural way to impose meaningful structure on $M_\mathbb{N}$ so that the above questions involving $J$ are easier to answer? (For example, if there were a way to define addition, so that if $S\in C_1$ and $T\in C_2$ and $S+T\in C_3$ for equivalence classes $C_i$, then a homomorphism respecting this would be nice.) (Personally, my favorite question.) Say two strings $S$ and $T$ are similar if they terminate in the same cycle. This is clearly an equivalence relation and it thus partitions $M_\mathbb{N}$. In variation B, it seems clear that there are infinitely many equivalence classes. In variation A, however, the fixed points are artifacts of the base $b$ in which we construe the strings. In this variation, how many equivalence classes are there as a function of $b$? Just a heads up: I've had several practicing mathematicians who work in various fields tell me that this question is unfeasibly difficult.
