416343,"If $f^2$ is differentiable, how pathological can $f$ be?","Apologies for what's probably a dumb question from the perspective of someone who paid better attention in real analysis class. Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval and $f : I \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that $f^2$ is differentiable.  It follows by elementary calculus that $f$ is differentiable wherever it is nonzero.  However, considering for instance $f(x) = |x|$ shows that $f$ is not necessarily differentiable at its zeroes. Can the situation with $f$ be any worse than a countable set of isolated singularities looking like the one that $f(x) = |x|$ has at the origin?",['real-analysis']

I know that a critical point with an indefinite Hessian matrix is a saddle point, but this is only a sufficient condition. $(0,0)$ is indeed a critical point of $g$, but the Hessian matrix is everywhere $0$ and hence it is positive and negative semi-definite and so not indefinite. How would I go about concluding that the origin is indeed a saddle point here?

416438,Transition functions of trivial vector bundle,"I have a question on trivial vector bundles. The question is as follows: Can we characterize the transition functions of a trivial vector
  bundle in some way? To be very concrete: suppose we have a vector bundle $E$, say of rank $3$, on an algebraic variety $X$ (or manifold if you prefer), and  we look at trivial sub-bundles $0\to F\to E$ of rank $2$. What can we say about the transition functions of $F$ if we know those of $E$? In this particular circumstance, we do have $3\times 3$ matrices at hand, and we want to produce $2\times 2$ matrices. The question is which ones are good. At the beginning, I thought I could extend an argument of pure linear algebra: if we have an exact sequence of vector spaces $0\to V\to W\to W/V\to 0$, we can complete a basis $(e_1,e_2)$ of $V$ to a basis $(e_1,e_2,e_3)$ of $W$, so that $W\to W/V$ is represented by the row vector $e_3$ and $V\to W$ by the $3\times 2$ matrix containing $e_1,e_2$ written as columns. This didn't bring me anywhere, even because I can't figure how to use the triviality hypothesis.","['algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
416455,The projection formula in Algebraic Geometry,"In this book , the projection formula stated as follows; Let $f:X\to Y$ a separated, quasi-compact morphism of schemes. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on X, $\mathcal{G}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $Y$. Then $(R^pf_*\mathcal{F})\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_Y}\mathcal{G}\cong R^pf_*(\mathcal{F}\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}f^*\mathcal{G})$ when $\mathcal{G}$ is flat over $Y$. But in other references, like Hartshorne or Vakil, it is little different: isomorphism holds when $\mathcal{G}$ is locally free (of finite rank). I think flat $\mathcal{O}_Y$-module is not locally free in general case. (These two are equivalent when $Y$ is locally noetherian and $\mathcal{G}$ is coherent) Q. Can we prove the formula just with flat condition? Actually, the proof in the book seems wrong; the author states $R^pf_*(\mathcal{F}\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}f^*\mathcal{G})(V)=H^p(f^{-1}(V),\mathcal{F}|_{f^{-1}(V)}\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_Y(V)}\mathcal{G}(V))$(this is the Cech cohomology) for affine open $V$.

416464,Neyman-Pearson lemma proof,"$\mathbf{Theorem}$ Let $\forall \alpha \in (0,1) \space \exists \space k$, such that for $W_0 = \{ x: p_1(x) \ge k p_0(x) \}$, $$\int_{W_0} p_0(x) d\mu(x)=\alpha$$ where $p_i(x)$ is the likelihood function under the hypothesis $i=0,1$. Then $\forall W$, such that 
$$\int_{W_0} p_0(x) d\mu(x) = \int_W p_0(x) d\mu(x) = \alpha$$
the following inequality is true:
$$\int_{W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x) \ge \int_W p_1(x) d\mu(x)$$ That is: an $H_0$ test based on the set $W_0$ is the most powerful test. $\mathbf{Proof}$ This is taken directly from my textbook:
\begin{align}
\int_{W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x) - \int_{W} p_1(x) d\mu(x) &= \int_{W_0-W} p_1(x) d\mu(x)- \int_{W-W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x)\\

&= \int_{W_0} k p_0(x) d\mu(x) - \int_{W} k p_0(x) d\mu(x) \\
&= k \alpha - k \alpha\\

\end{align} I don't understand the magic in the first line. $$\int_{W_0-W} p_1(x) d\mu(x)- \int_{W-W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x)$$ What is the meaning of $W_0 - W$?  These are sets, so shouldn't we have $W_0 \setminus W$ instead? I know we can't directly say that 
$$\int_{W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x) - \int_{W} p_1(x) d\mu(x) \ge \int_{W_0} k p_0(x) d\mu(x) - \int_{W} k p_0(x) d\mu(x) $$ 
because we only know that $\forall x \in W_0$ $$\int_{W_0} p_1(x) d\mu(x) \ge \int_{W_0} k p_0(x) d\mu(x)$$ and the same is not necessarily true for $x \in W$.

416528,Why is the Lie derivative linear in the vector field?,"This might seem a very basic question, but I can't manage to find a proper proof in the books I have on my desk (or simply cannot see that it's ""just that""). So be sure of what we talk about, let $G$ a Lie group, $V$ a (finite dimentional) representation of $G$ and $X$ an element of the Lie algebra $LG$ of $G$. Let also $\exp : LG \to G$ denote the usual exponential map. Then define 
$$
L_X(v):=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{1}{t}(\exp(tX)v-v)
$$
It is clear to me that it is linear in $v$, and that $L_{sX}v = sL_Xv$, but I'm having trouble proving that $L_{X+Y}v = L_Xv + L_Yv$. I tried the following : a) Rewrite $L_Xv$ as 
$$
L_Xv = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\exp(tX)v
$$
then use the fact that $\exp$ is the unique map such that $\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\exp(tX) = X$ to get $L_{X+Y}v = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\exp(t(X+Y))v = (X+Y)v = Xv + Yv = L_Xv + L_Yv$ but I'm not sure if I can do this. So if yomeone could tell me if I can, and why, that would be great ! b) In matrix form, $\frac{1}{t}(\exp(tX) - Id) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{t^{k-1}}{k!}X^k $ so 
$$
\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{1}{t}(\exp(tX)v-v) = Xv
$$
and then conclude as in a). But here again, I don't know if I can do that in general.","['lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
416541,Can a set of non self-intersection points of a space-filling curve contain an arc?,"Consider a continuous surjection $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]\times[0,1]$. It can be proved that set of self-intersection points must be dense. In the Hilbert curve, the set of self-intersections are points (a,b) such that either a or b can be written as $\frac{m}{2^k}$ for some integers $k≥1$ and $1≤m<2^k$ (see this explanation ). So the set of self-intersections is dense and of measure $0$, but you cannot draw any vertical or horizontal line without intersecting it. This leads me to the question: can there exist, for some space-filling curve, an arc (homeomorphic to a non-degenerate closed interval)

What I gather so far is that if $char(F) \neq 2$ then there is a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic forms and bilinear forms so that the corresponding theories are equivalent. However, if $char(F) = 2$, while it's still possible to define a bilinear form in terms of a quadratic form it's no longer possible to recover the quadratic form from it. Is this irreversibility what distinguishes the case $char(F) = 2$ from $char(F) \neq 2$ or is there a more fundamental difference that I'm not aware of?","['linear-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
416563,"For any arbitrary large, even gap, are there an infinite number of prime pairs separated by that gap?","Since Zhang Yitang announced his proof that there are an infinite number of prime pairs with gaps less than 70 million, there's been a lot of work toward possibly proving the twin prime conjecture from his approach, or at least reducing the bound as much as possible - currently to less than 300,000. If we say that gaps below the current limit of this approach are ""small"" gaps, and gaps above that limit are ""large"" gaps, then my question is: What do we know about the number of prime pairs that differ by a given large gap? Obviously, for odd gaps one member of the pair must be 2, and there will be at most one other prime that can result in a given gap. By the Prime Number Theorem, most specific large odd gaps will have exactly zero prime pairs that differ by that amount. But it's not clear to me what we know about large even gaps: For any specific large even gap, are there an infinite number of prime pairs with that exact gap? If we don't know this, can we prove that for any large even gap there are either an infinite number of prime pairs separated by that distance, or zero prime pairs separated by that distance? Can we at least say that there is some very large gap distance (that is, much larger than 70 million) above which condition 2 obtains?","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"

Here $\sim$ is defined as follows: fix a linear isomorphism $L$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and set $(0,v)\sim(1,Lv)$ for all $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Here's what I've thought so far and my idea for solving this. There is a smooth map $\pi:E\longrightarrow S^1$ that maps points $[(t,v)]$, $0<t<1$, to points $s(t)\in S^1$, $s(t)\neq \mathbf{1}$, where $\mathbf{1}\in S^1$ is the point where the gluing of $[0,1]$ took place ($s(t)$ is $p(t)$ where $p:[0,1]\longrightarrow S^1$ is just the defining quotient map of $S^1$), and $\pi$ maps $[(0,v)]=[(1,v)]$ to $\mathbf{1}\in S^1$.

416683,Number of edge colorings in a tetrahedron with three colors. Is my solution correct?,"I've tried to count rotationally distinct edge colorings (both proper and improper) in a regular tetrahedron with three colors. Could you take a look if it's correct? First the improper colorings. There are $3^6$ colorings in all. There are twelve rotations of a tetrahedron: one identity rotation, eight $120^\circ$-rotations around the altitudes, three $180^\circ$-rotations around the the axes of which each intesects two non-intersecting edges in their midpoints. The identity rotation is okay for every coloring. There are $3^6$ colorings invariant under it. A $120^\circ$-rotation requires all edges incident with the endpoint of the altitude around which we're rotating to be the same color, and all the rest of the edges to be another color. There are $3^2$ colorings invariant under such a rotation. The colorings invariant under a $180^\circ$-rotation are such that in the pair of non-intersecting edges defining the rotation, the edges have any colors whatever, and in the other two pairs, both edges have the same color. For any such rotation, there are therefore $3^4$ rotations invariant under it (because we need to color: the first edge in the defining pair, the second edge in it, the edges in the first of the remaining pairs and the edges in the second one). Therefore, by Burnside's lemma, we have $${1\over12}(1\times3^6+8\times3^2+3\times3^4)=87$$ rotationally distinct, improper edge colorings of a regular tetrahedron with three colors. For the proper colorings, there are six of them in all. In each of the three pairs of non-intersecting edges, both edges have to be the same color, and each of the pairs has to have a different color. Every such coloring is proper, so there are $3!=6$ proper colorings. Each of them is invariant under the identity rotation. None of them is invariant under a $120^\circ$-rotation, and all of them are invariant under a $180^\circ$-rotation. Therefore, there are $${1\over 12}(1\times 6+8\times 0+3\times 6)=2$$ rotationally invariant, proper edge colorings of a regular tetrahedron with three colors.","['graph-theory', 'coloring', 'group-theory', 'polyhedra']"

I'm clearly missing the obvious, but I don't see where the requirement $K \subseteq J$ comes into the proof.  Since $f$ is also a homomorphism of additive groups, the image $f(J)$ must be closed under addition and negatives (correct?). Then for $f(J)$ to be an ideal we have to show that it is closed under multiplication by an arbitrary element $b \in B$. Since $f$ is onto, there is some $a \in A$ such that $b = f(a)$. Let $j'$ be any element of $f(J)$, so $j' = f(j)$ for some $j \in J$. Then $bj' = f(a)f(j) = f(aj)$, and $aj \in J$ since $J$ is an ideal.

I think that calculating the probability of $X$ being greater than the said value $D$ analysing this for every possible mean greater than $\lambda$ is a possible path to follow, but I'm not sure of how difficult to calculate this would be.

(g) $ \quad x^2 + y^2 - x - 2y = 0, \quad x + 2y = c$,  Ans. c = 0 or 5. The process is to solve for $y$, then to substitute that into second equation.
From that we get A, B and C. Delta being $B^2 - 4AC$ we can get parameter. So $y = (c - x) / 2$ $x^2 + y^2 - x -2y = 0$ $x^2 + ((c-x)/2)^2 - x - 2 * ((c-x)/2) = 0$ and i got lost...","['algebra-precalculus', 'systems-of-equations', 'polynomials']"
416811,Is there a nice characterization of these classes of functions on a set of $n$ elements?,"I am looking at the set of all functions from $[n] \to [n]$, where $[n] = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Now, I consider two functions equivalent, if they are conjugates by some permutation, that is, they are the same upto renaming of the elements. For example, if $n=3$, I consider $1\mapsto 1,2\mapsto3,3\mapsto3$ to be equivalent to $1\mapsto 1,2\mapsto2,3\mapsto1$. Is there a ""nice"" set of representatives, or a nice characterization of the equivalence classes? If there is no ""perfect"" characterization, is there a set of representatives with fairly few repetitions of the same class? As an analogue, if we were to consider only permutations, instead of all functions, each (unordered) partition of $[n]$ characterizes a class via the cycle decomposition. Some progress: Every class has some function $f$ that satisfies $f(x) \leq x+1$ for each $x$. If we consider each function as a graph on $n$ nodes, then each class almost corresponds to graphs of the following form upto isomorphism: A number of disjoint cycles, with some trees attached some of the nodes of the cycles.","['functions', 'combinatorics']"

If $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ is $1{-}1$ and continuous, then $f$ is strictly monotone on $I$. The answer in the back of the book$^1$, which I found after writing the following proof, says this is false (no explanation). However, I cannot find an error in my proof or think of a viable counterexample. What am I overlooking? Suppose not, and there exists some $x_1,x_2,x_3\in I$ with $x_1<x_2<x_3$ such that $f(x_1)\leq f(x_2)$ and $f(x_2)\geq f(x_3)$, or $f(x_1)\geq f(x_2)$ and $f(x_2)\leq f(x_3)$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $f(x_1)\leq f(x_2)$ and $f(x_2)\geq f(x_3)$. If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ or $f(x_2)=f(x_3)$ then $f$ would not be $1{-}1$; thus, $f(x_1)<f(x_2)$ and $f(x_2)>f(x_3)$. We are left with two possible cases. Case 1. Suppose $f(x_1)<f(x_3)$. Then $f(x_1)<f(x_3)<f(x_2)$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists point $x_0\in (x_1, x_2)$ such that $f(x_0)=f(x_3)$ with $x_0\neq x_3$ since $x_3\notin (x_1,x_2)$, a contradiction since $f$ is $1{-}1$. Case 2. Suppose $f(x_1)>f(x_3)$. Then $f(x_3)<f(x_1)<f(x_2)$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists point $x_0\in (x_2,x_3)$ such that $f(x_0)=f(x_1)$ with $x_0\neq x_1$ since $x_1\notin (x_2,x_3)$, a contradiction since $f$ is $1{-}1$. If we assume that $f(x_1)\geq f(x_2)$ and $f(x_2)\leq f(x_3)$ we are lead to similar contradictions; thus, $f$ is strictly monotone. $\blacksquare$ 1: An Introduction to Analysis by William R.

The proofs of many interesting theorems of basic analysis or advanced calculus are in part driven by the contraction mapping technique.The usual story: identify an equation you want to solve, replace the real solution with an affine approximation based on derivative data, propose a mapping whose fixed point provides a solution to the equation, this map is inspired by the approximation show the mapping is a contraction mapping and use the theorem associated to the context which provides the existence of the fixed point as a limit of a sequence of approximate functions. I hope this gives you a ball-park idea of what I intend by saying contraction mapping technique . In Edwards Advanced Calculus text he uses this scheme to prove the multivariate mean value theorem and the inverse mapping theorem. I know a similar arguments can be used to prove existence theorems for ODEs. Question: what is the history of the scheme above. Is it due to Banach? Is it due to Lipschitz?

417127,Surjectivity of the Gauss map in Hilbert spaces,"Suppose that $H$ is a Hilbert space and $M\subset H$ is a closed subset with non-empty interior and smooth boundary, whatever smooth boundary could mean. I wonder if the Gauss map on $\partial M$ is onto on the sphere, I hope yes. The finite dimensional case, say dimension n, is easier (but not easy for me, I lack of enough training) and the problem can be stated better, using a n-dimensional manifold instead a closed subset, but I can not figure out what happens in $l^2$, is the hypothesis true or false? The hypothesis holds obviously if $M$ is a closed ball. We should assume that $M$ is bounded. For the finite dimensional case, take any unit vector $v$ and a plane with $v$ as a normal vector. Sweep the plane through the space until it touches $M$, the Gauss map at the first point of contact with $M$ is $v$. The problem in the infinite dimensional case is to verify the existence of the first point of contact. If $M$ is convex, that point exits. To define smoothness I propose the following: suppose that $x\in\partial M$ and that there exists a functional $F$ defined in a neighborhood $U$ of $x$, such that $F=0$ on $\partial M\cap U$ and $dF(x)$ is a non-zero bounded linear functional.

$p_1,..,p_k$, $q_1,\dots, q_l$ such that
$$
X=\{x\in\mathbb C^n:\ p_1(x)=0,\dots,p_k(x)=0, q_1(x)\ne 0,\dots, q_l(x)\ne 0\}.
$$
Hence,
$$
X\subset Y:=\{x\in\mathbb C^n:\ p_1(x)=0\}.
$$
It is well known that the measure of $Y$ is zero. ${\bf Question\ 2:}$ Can I immediately conclude that the statement $S$ does not hold for almost all $x\in \mathbb R^n$, that is $mes\{x\in\mathbb R^n:\ S \text{ holds}\}=0$? Proof: assume that $mes\{x\in \mathbb R^n:\ S \text{ holds}\}>0$, then
$mes\{x\in \mathbb R^n:\ S \text{ holds and } q_1(x)\ne 0,\dots, q_l(x)\ne 0\}>0$. This means that each polynomial $p_i$
vanishes on the set of nonzero measure and hence $p_i$ is identical zero.",['algebraic-geometry']
417541,Existence of $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\prod_{z^n=1}f(z)}{\prod _{z^n=-1}f(z)}$,"I have a following problem: Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of unit disk such that $|f(z)|>1$ for every $|z|=1$. Does there exist the following limit?
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\prod_{z^n=1}f(z)}{\prod _{z^n=-1}f(z)}$$
Intuitively, I think if $f$ behaves nicely, such as if $f$ maps $S^1$ to a closed curve..., the limit exists and equals 1 (may be different by $(-1)^n$, for example if we choose $f(z)=2z$). In general I don't know how to verify if it's true or not. Someone can give me some conditions such that it's true? Thanks in advance!","['calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"
