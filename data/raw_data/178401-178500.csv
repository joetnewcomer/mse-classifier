3228266,Proof of familiarity between 9 people,How can we try to prove that among any 9  people thare are 3 people who are familiar with each other or 4 who are not familiar with each other? My approach: I try to convert this to graph theory. So I have a graph with 9 vertices which is clique. Now we try to point the graph edges into 2 colors. When we show that there always exist 3-clique or 4-clique in the same color in this graph then the statement will be proved. But how to start considering the graph?,"['graph-theory', 'ramsey-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3228412,Related rates of change: what am I doing wrong?,"I'm new to derivatives, and I try to solve the following exercise: A ground camera is being used to film the lift-off of a rocket from its launch pad. The rocket rises vertically so that its vertical distance $y$ , in meters, is related to time $t$ , in seconds from launch, by $y=10t^2$ . Determine the rate of change of the angle of elevation of the camera $10s$ after the launch if the camera is situated horizontally $600m$ from the launch pad. So my way of thinking is like this:
The angle of the camera is related to the rocket's height by the following formula: $$tan(\alpha)=\frac{y(t)}{600meters}=\frac{10t^2}{600}=\frac{1}{60}t^2$$ so $$\alpha=arctan(\frac{1}{60}t^2)$$ So the rate of change of the angle is: $$\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}arctan(\frac{1}{60}t^2)=\frac{\frac{1}{60}2t}{1+(\frac{1}{60}t^2)^2}=\frac{120t}{t^4 + 3600}$$ So the rate of change of the angle $10s$ after the launch is: $$\alpha'(10seconds)=\frac{120*10}{10^4+3600}=0.088 rad/s$$ But the answer on my solution sheet is $0.9 rad/s$ , it's a different order of magnitude. Is there an error in the solution sheet or am I doing something wrong? Thank you in advance for your help","['calculus', 'trigonometry']"
3228416,Topological vector spaces with a unique trivial nonempty convex set which is algebraically open,"Let $X$ be a topological vector space. We recall that a set $A\subseteq X$ is algebraically if, for each $x,y \in X$ , the set $\{t \in \mathbf{R}: x+ty \in A\}$ is open. Moreover, it is well known (and easy to prove) that every open set is algebraically open. Also, there are non-open sets which are algebraically open (see e.g. here ). In addition, if $A$ is convex, then the converse holds in $X=\mathbf{R}^n$ . This is still false in an arbitrary topological vector space $X$ (see e.g. here ). Question . Does there exist a topological vector space $X$ such that the only convex algebraically open non-empty subset is $X$ itself? Ps. Replacing ""algebraically open"" with the the stronger ""open"" the answer is positive, setting $X=L_p([0,1])$ , for some $p \in (0,1)$ .","['convex-geometry', 'general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces']"
3228503,Local system associated to monodromy representation,"How can I associate a local system to a representation $\rho: \pi_1(X) \to \mathbb C^*$ ? I have seen some construction, but it doesn't click for me. I know that the idea is to use a diagonal action of $\pi_1(X)$ on $\tilde X \times \mathbb C$ , where $P: \tilde X \to X$ is the universal cover. But why does one obtain a local system in this way? For example, I have seen the construction (with $L_{\tilde X}$ the trivial sheaf on $\tilde X$ ): $$\Gamma(U,\mathcal L):= \{s \in \Gamma(P^{-1}(U,L_{\tilde X})):~ \forall u \in P^{-1}(U), \forall \gamma \in \pi_1(X,v),~ s(\gamma.u)=\rho(\gamma).s(u) \}. $$ I guess the sheaf axioms are inherited from $L_{\tilde X}$ . But why is this locally constant? My approach: $P$ is a covering map, so we automatically get nice neighbourhoods to work with. But then how do I proceed?","['complex-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'fundamental-groups', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"
3228505,Understanding i.i.d. random variables from product measure space perspective,"I have a very weak background in measure theory, and I am having some troubles understanding i.i.d. random variables from a measure theoretic perspective. Let $X$ be a random variable defined on a probability triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},P)$ . I have seen that some authors write "" $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are $n$ independent copies of $X$ "", which I understand as $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d. random variables having the same distribution as that of $X$ . 
I found that the most intuitive way to construct an i.i.d. sequence to me is to define $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ on a product measure space $(\Omega^n, \mathcal{F}^n,P^n)$ . Here is how I understand this construction.
When we say something like $(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = (X_1(\omega),\ldots, X_n(\omega))$ , this $\omega$ belongs to $\Omega^n$ , whereas when we consider $X(\tau)$ , this $\tau$ is in $\Omega$ . So $\omega$ and $\tau$ belong to different spaces unless $n=1$ . Thus, $X_i$ and $X$ are completely different functions (defined on different domains $\Omega^n$ and $\Omega$ ). So, $X_i$ is not a copy of $X$ as a function, but they just have the same distribution. Moreover, as $n$ changes, the probability triple $(\Omega^n, \mathcal{F}^n,P^n)$ also changes accordingly. Hence, for example, if we consider $(X_1(\gamma), X_2(\gamma))$ and $(X_1(\sigma),X_2(\sigma),X_3(\sigma))$ , $\gamma$ and $\sigma$ live in different spaces, $\Omega^2$ and $\Omega^3$ . So, the random variable $X_1$ in the pair $(X_1, X_2)$ and $X_1$ in the triple $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ are also different functions (defined on different domains), but having the same distribution, and denoted by the same notation. Is this understanding correct? I am confused since the dependency on $n$ does not seem to be explicitly specified in most cases, and they seem to use the same notations $\omega$ , $\Omega$ , $X_i$ , etc. everywhere.

3228507,Calculate a limit: $\lim_{t \to 0+} {1\over 2}\cdot({\pi \over t}\cdot\frac{1+e^{-2\pi t}}{1 - e^{-2\pi t}} - {1\over t^2}) $,"Please calculate the limit $\lim\limits_{t \to 0+} {1\over 2}\cdot \left({\pi \over t}\cdot\frac{1+e^{-2\pi t}}{1 - e^{-2\pi t}} - {1\over t^2}\right)$ and provide the corresponding procedure. The answer is $\pi^2 \over 6$ . I tried L'Hospital's Rule but I failed. The following is not necessary to read: The background of this problem: this problem arose from a problem related to the Fourier Transform. I tried to use Poisson's summation formula to get $\sum\limits_{n = -\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + t^2} = {\pi \over t}\cdot\frac{1+e^{-2\pi t}}{1 - e^{-2\pi t}}$ . (This can be proved by let $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2+t^2}$ , where $t>0$ is a parameter. Then $\hat{f}(n) = {\pi \over t}\cdot e^{-2\pi |n| t}$ .) Then $\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty {1\over n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $ should be a corollary.","['limits', 'calculus']"

Other people suggested: $$Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma}$$ My problem here is we are assuming it is normal and we are not utilizing the given info about the sample size of 16. I suggested: $$Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$ My problem here is we are again assuming it is normal and I am getting $2<Z<6$ , which gives about $2\%$ .

3228550,Probability of population parameter to be contained in confidence interval,"First of all, I have found this question: Interpretation of confidence interval which might seem as a duplicate. As well as this explanation http://onlinestatbook.com/2/estimation/confidence.html within it -- but I find it hard to understand. In the second link it is stated that: Confidence intervals for means are intervals constructed using a
  procedure that will contain the population mean a specified proportion of the time, typically either
  95% or 99% of the time. An example of a 95% confidence
  interval is shown below: 72.85 < μ < 107.15 There is good reason to believe that the population mean lies between
  these two bounds of 72.85 and 107.15 since 95% of the time confidence
  intervals contain the true mean. But also: It is natural to interpret a 95% confidence interval as an interval
  with a 0.95 probability of containing the population mean. However,
  the proper interpretation is not that simple. One problem is that the
  computation of a confidence interval does not take into account any
  other information you might have about the value of the population
  mean. For example, if numerous prior studies had all found sample
  means above 110, it would not make sense to conclude that there is a
  0.95 probability that the population mean is between 72.85 and 107.15. What about situations in which there is no prior information about the
  value of the population mean? Even here the interpretation is complex.
  The problem is that there can be more than one procedure that produces
  intervals that contain the population parameter 95% of the time. Which
  procedure produces the ""true"" 95% confidence interval? For the sake of the discussion I rather refer to a situation in which one can have huge amount of data, and the confidence level can be extremely high. My questions are: If one can't say it is as likely for the population parameter to be inside the interval as the confidence level, why does the author write ""There is good reason to believe that the population mean lies between these two bounds (...)"" in the first paragraph? In the second quoted paragraph the author refers to a situation in which there was a prior information. I don't see how that is relevant. If your confidence level is, say $1-2^{-30}$ , it is indeed very unlikely you get an interval which contradicts previous studies. If it indeed happens, one must conclude that one of you had a mistake. You, or the previous studies. Where am I wrong? Also in the second paragraph the author writes: ... there can be more than one procedure that produces intervals that contain the population parameter 95% of the time. Which procedure produces the ""true"" 95% confidence interval? I didn't understand this line, what is he trying to say? To summarize, I'll try to compare it to null hypothesis rejecting, which I understand better: If I randomly pick a confidence interval from a set of confidence intervals, of which $1-2^{-30}$ contain the true population parameter, why can't I say it is as likely I have picked a good interval, as it is likely the null hypothesis should be rejected when $p\leq2^{-30}$ ? Note: I am a beginning math student. I have taken with passion some basic math classes such as Linear Algebra 101, and Calculus, but nothing more.
In statistics I have a reasonable understanding of basic hypothesis testing (null hypothesis, statistical significance, p-values).","['statistics', 'confidence-interval']"

3229088,Raising to the power of $i$,"We all know the usual exponentiation $a^i$ in the complex setting; one can ask is there such a map in a given group; more specifically is there a criterion in the general sense such that given an abelian group $G$ one can determine with the criterion whether there is a homomorphism $\phi_{i}$ such that for any $x \in G$ we have that $\phi_{i}(\phi_i(x)) = x^{-1}$ (because we need $(x^{i})^{i} = x^{-1}$ this is ofcourse very informal). Note that for groups $Z/(p)$ there is such a criterion. If there is a map $\phi_{i} $ in $Z/(p)$ then given a primitive element $q \in Z/(p)$ one has that $\phi_i(q) = q^{a}$ for some $a \in \mathbb{N}$ hence $\phi_i(q^{a}) \equiv q^{a^2} \equiv q^{-1}$ hence $a^2+1 \equiv 0$ $mod$ $(p-1)$ which is iff there is no prime $r$ that is $3 $ mod $4$ dividing $p-1$ . One automatically realizes that $Z/(2)$ has such a homomorphism, for $p \geq 3$ we also need $p \equiv 3$ mod $(4)$ as for $p \equiv 1$ mod $(4)$ we have that $p-1 \equiv 0 mod 4$ and hence if $\phi_i(q^{a}) \equiv q^{a^2} \equiv q^{-1}$ mod $(p)$ we have that $a^2+1 \equiv 0 mod 4$ which is impossible. After working through the details one arrives at the conclusion that if there is a homomorphism $\phi_{i}$ in $Z/(p)$ then $p = 2$ or $p \equiv 3 $ mod $(4)$ and $p-1$ has no prime $q$ which is $3$ mod $(4)$ (we need that any prime $q$ which is $3$ mod $(4)$ does not divide $p-1$ ). This criterion is only for a small class of finite groups.","['number-theory', 'group-theory']"
3229114,How to define pivot columns?,"When you use Gaussian elimination to solve a homogeneous system of linear equations, you end up with ""pivot variables"" and ""non-pivot variables"".  The non-pivot variables have the property that they can each be chosen freely, and once specified, they uniquely determine a solution to the equation. I'm looking for a characterization of these free variables that depends on the operator $A$ and the choice of basis $\{b_i\}$ but does not refer to the Gaussian elimination process itself. For example, you could look at the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0$ and determine that any two of the variables can be chosen freely and uniquely determine the third, whereas one variable is insufficient and three variables is too many to be chosen freely. For another example, take $$x_0 + x_1 + x_2 = 0\\ x_0 + x_3 + x_4 = 0.$$ The set $\{x_0, x_2,x_3\}$ consists of variables that can be freely chosen and uniquely determine a solution. In contrast, $\{x_0,x_1,x_2\}$ cannot be chosen freely, despite having three variables. My goal is to find a test that can identify which sets of variables uniquely and freely determine a solution. My starting point is Gaussian elimination, where the non-pivot rows show you one such subset of variables. I would like to be able to characterize all such sets of variables, without reference to Gaussian elimination. Here's my attempt. Let $A$ be a matrix with basis $B=\{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$ . Reduce $A$ using Gaussian elimination. Let $N$ be the submatrix of $\text{rref}(A)$ consisting of the non-pivot columns. I believe $N$ is equivalent to the kernel map for $A$ expressed in our basis, in which case it can be defined without referring to the elimination process—is that right? Consider a subset of variables $E\equiv \{e_1,\ldots, e_d\}\subseteq \{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$ . These variables might have the desired property, or not. To determine whether $E$ has the desired property (i.e. the variables of $E$ may be chosen freely, and when they are chosen, they uniquely determine a solution to the homogeneous equation.), consider the linear map $Q:\mathbb{R}^d \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ induced by the inclusion of $E$ into $B$ .  The requirement is that $QN$ is the identity map $I_{d\times d}$ . (Or maybe just that $QN$ is invertible.) I got this definition by trying to formalize the idea that each basis vector in $E$ meets (has a nonzero dot product with) the columns of the null matrix in exactly one unique place. That is, it forms a kind of identity sub matrix. Because it meets each vector exactly once, we know that the variables can be chosen freely and uniquely determine a solution. Is this right? Is there a better formulation? Thanks for your help. P.S. For example of how to apply this method, consider the following separate problems $A_1 = [1,1]$ , versus $A_2 = [1,0]$ .  Each of these problems is a system with two variables and one equation $(A : \mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ with $m=2$ , $n=1$ ). Each has a one-dimensional space of solutions (the nullity of $A$ is $d=1$ ). Our basis of variables $B$ consists of the standard basis vectors. Any set of $d=1$ vectors (i.e. the singleton sets $\{e_1\}$ , $\{e_2\}$ ) is a candidate for being a complete set of free variables. To test them, 
we consider the inclusions of $e_1$ or $e_2$ from $\mathbb{R}^m \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ : $$E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ $$E_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$ We will need the kernel maps of $A_1$ and $A_2$ . These are maps $\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ . The kernel of the matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ are, respectively: $$K_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1\\ -1\end{bmatrix}\qquad u\mapsto \langle u,-u\rangle$$ $$K_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\qquad v \mapsto \langle 0, v\rangle$$ When we test whether $E_1$ and $E_2$ are free variables for the first matrix, we find: $$E_1K_1 = [1]\\ E_2K_1 = [-1]$$ Whereas for the second matrix, we find: $$E_1K_2 = [0]\\ E_2K_2 = [1]$$ By examining which of these is an invertible transformation $\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ , we have determined that $\{e_1\}$ and $\{e_2\}$ are complete unique variable sets for the first system $A_1$ , but only $\{e_2\}$ is a complete unique variable set for the second system $A_2$ .","['systems-of-equations', 'category-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations', 'gaussian-elimination']"

If this is called $p_n,$ the solution is to obtain the $n$ th partial sum of the series for $1/e.$ So we have, for $n=1,2,3,\cdots,$ that $$p_n=\frac{1}{0!}-\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}-\frac{1}{3!}+\cdots+\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}.$$ For odd $n,$ the likelihood increases as $n$ does. This seems peculiar (to me) in that for more people checking their hats, it would become more likely that at least one person got their own hat, and so less likely that nobody did. For even $n$ as $n$ goes up the likelihood $p_n$ decreases as expected by the vague (incorrect) intuition proposed above. I'm looking for some reasonable intuitive reason why one would expect this even/odd $n$ behavior for this problem.

For clarification, I am interested in lattice points found both strictly inside the sphere, and on its surface. I want to count exactly how many such points there are. This count corresponds to the amount of sets of integers that are solutions to the equation $$a_1^2+a_2^2+a_3^2+...+a_{n-1}^2+a_n^2= R^2$$ where the $a_i$ 's are required to be integers, not necessarily positive, and sets that differ just by the order of the summands are also considered distinct , i.e for the case $n=3, R=5$ , the following are both counted: $3^2+(-4)^2+0^2$ and $(-4)^2+0^2+3^2$ . This can also be interpreted as the sum of squares function - $r_d(k)$ denotes in how many such ways I can write $k$ as the sum of $d$ squares. This means that $$S_n(R) = \sum_{k=1}^{R^2}r_n(k)$$ I am asking this question as a general one, but I am mostly concerned about the cases of $n=2, n=3,n=4$ . In order not to be too lengthy and remain focused, I won't explain why but summing this way requires to factor each $k$ first. This is very time consuming, so I searched for better ways. For the case of $n=2$ , which is essentially just the count of lattice points in a circle of radius $R$ , I have managed to find that $$S_2(R)= 1+\sum_{i=1}^\infty\biggl(\biggl \lfloor\frac{R^2}{4i+1}\biggl \rfloor-\biggl \lfloor\frac{R^2}{4i+3}\biggl \rfloor\biggl )$$ For the case of $n=4$ , I found: $$S_4(R)= 1+8\sum_{k=1}^{R^2}\sum_{d|k \atop {4\nmid d}}d$$ Unfortunately, for the case of a sphere ( $n=3$ ), I have found no formula, neither for the count of lattice points inside nor on the surface of the sphere. Although these formulas do indeed provide the exact count of lattice points, they are very slow in computational terms, as their running time complexity is $O(R^2)$ . I was wondering if a more efficient way exists to count the number of such lattice points, perhaps $O(R)$ or $O(R^{1/2+\epsilon})$ , so that I can work with radii as big as $10^9$ or even more. I suspect there is a way, but I can't find it. Not necessarily a different approach to the problem, but rather just a more clever way to reduce the order of the sum.

I am listening to a master course in Algebraic Geometry. My question belongs to Proposition II.5.4 in Hartshorne's ""Algebraic Geometry"". I want to show that the following statements are equivalent: Proposition : Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ be a prescheme and $\mathcal{F}$ be an $\mathcal{O}_X$ -module. Then the following statements are equivalent: 1) For all open affine $U \subseteq X$ there is an $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)$ -module M, sucht that $F_{|U} \cong \tilde{M}$ . 2) There is an open affine covering $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $X$ and some $\Gamma(U_i, \mathcal{O}_X)$ -modules $M_i$ , such that $\mathcal{F}_{|U_i} \cong \tilde{M_i}$ .} The implication from 1) to 2) is clear. To prove the other direction, I oriented at the proof of Hartshorne. I hope, you can fill the gaps: First, I proved the following lemma: Lemma : Let $M$ be an $R$ -module and $\mathcal{F}=\tilde{M}$ . Then $\mathcal{F}_{|D(f)} \cong \tilde{M_f}$ for any $f \in R$ . Proof of the proposition : Let $U =SpecR \subseteq X$ be open and affine. Assume, the second statement holds. We denote the corresponding ring of $U_i$ by $R_i$ . Then $\{U \cap U_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an open, not necessarily affine covering of $U$ . Step 1: We want to show, that $\mathcal{F}{|U}$ satisfies the second statement. Since $U \cap U_i \subseteq U_i$ is open, \begin{align*}
U \cap U_i = \bigcup_{j \in J_i} D(g_{ij})
\end{align*} for some $g_{ij} \in R_i$ . Therefore, $\{D(g_{ij}) ~|~ i \in I, j \in J_i\}$ is an open affine coveriung of $U$ . Using the lemma and the assumption, we have: \begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}_{|D(g_{ij})} = {\mathcal{F}_{|U_i}}_{|D(g_{ij})} \cong \widetilde{{(M_i)}_{g_{ij}}}
\end{align*} Step 2: We want to finish the proof. We define $M = \Gamma(U, \mathcal{F}_{|U})$ . So we have the identity map \begin{align*}
M \to \Gamma(U, \mathcal{F}_{|U}).
\end{align*} Since $\widetilde{}$ and $\Gamma$ are adjoint functors, this leads to a map \begin{align*}
\alpha \colon \tilde{M} \to \mathcal{F}_{|U}.
\end{align*} Now, I want to use that $\alpha_{|D(g_{ij})}$ is the isomorphism, which we received in step 1. Because then, since the $D(g_{ij})$ 's are an open covering, $\alpha$ has to be an isomorphism. But why is this the case? Thank you in advance for your help.

Recently I've stumbled upon a paper which states that this fact follows from Euler's theorem as the expression is homogeneous of degree $1$ as a function of $S$ and $K$ and therefore can be written as a linear combination of its partial derivatives: $$f(S,K)=S \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}+K \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial K}$$ I see how this makes the above result much more reasonable but I don't see how it actually proves this fact. Imagine for example the function $f(S,K)=S+K$ . We have: $$f(S,K)=S\cdot \frac{K}{S}+K\cdot \frac{S}{K}$$ And yet $\frac{\partial f}{\partial S}=1 \neq \frac{K}{S}$ as well as $\frac{\partial f}{\partial K}=1 \neq \frac{S}{K}$ .

3230060,Why is the interchange of a sum and an integral not justified here?,"This problem arose when I was studying the analytic continuation of the $\Gamma$ function. Consider $$f(z) = \int_{0}^1 e^{-t}t^{z-1} dt$$ This integral converges only for $\Re(z)>0$ . However, if we expand $e^{-t}$ into power series and interchange the summation and integration, we get that $$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)}$$ which converges for every $z \not = -n$ . This of course means that the interchange of summation and integration was not justified. However, I attempted to come up with a justification anyway, and I cannot find the mistake. Can you help me find it please? Justification We will use the Weierstrass $M$ -test. First, if we replace $e^{-t}$ by a power seires and simplify, we get $$f(z) = \int_0^1 \left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} \right]dt$$ We will now show that for $0< \delta < 1$ , the series converges uniformly on $[\delta, 1]$ . We have $$\left|\dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1}  \right| = \dfrac {1}{n!}t^{\Re(z)+n-1}$$ For $n$ large enough (greater than some $N$ ), we have $\Re(z)+n-1 > 0$ , and as a result, $$\dfrac {1}{n!}t^{\Re(z)+n-1} < \dfrac {1}{n!} = M_n, \text{ and } \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} M_n \text{converges}$$ Therefore $$\sum_{n=N}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1}$$ converges uniformly on $[\delta, 1]$ , and as a result, $$\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1}  + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} $$ converges uniformly on $[\delta, 1].$ Therefore $$\int_{\delta}^1 \left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} \right]dt = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left[ \int_{\delta}^1  \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} dt \right] = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left[ \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)}- \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)} \delta^{n+z} \right]$$ $$= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)} - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)} \delta^{n+z}$$ Now looking at the sum on the right as a function of $\delta$ , we can argue that the series converges uniformly by splitting up the series as we did above. Thus if we take the limit as $\delta \to 0$ , that sum vanishes and we get that $$\int_{0}^1 \left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!}t^{n+z-1} \right]dt = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \dfrac {(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)} $$ , as desired.","['complex-analysis', 'gamma-function', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

This is plotted from $1 \leq x,y \leq 100$ : In this picture, yellow values are higher, blue values are lower. So you can see the function is at its lowest when $x:y$ is closest to a simple ratio. For all $x$ , we have $f(x,x) = 2$ . However, for sufficiently large $x$ , we also have $f(x,x+1) = 3$ , $f(x,x+2)=4$ , etc, so this function is also in some sense measuring the distance to the nearest low-slope line. In comparison, here's the gcd(x,y) function: So you can see that while both functions feature prominent rational slopes, that the first one seems to be ""smoothed"" relative to the GCD, and also reaches minima at rational slopes rather than maxima . Is there some simple function that this resembles? Here is a CSV, if anyone wants to play with it, but due to the way I calculated this function, there may be some sporadic errors (though should be good for $x,y < 50$ or so: https://pastebin.com/raw/vEWAdBVM Just to say how I got this function: So for each $x,y$ pair, I generated the vector $(x,y,1)$ . Then, I wanted to find the ""shortest"" integer bivector that is the wedge product of $(x,y,1) \wedge v$ for some $v$ with integer coordinates. This is a plot of the norm of the resulting shortest bivector for each $(x,y)$ . I was using the $\ell_1$ norm to measure shortest for the thing I'm doing, but you get the same basic plot with the $\ell_2$ norm, as well as any $\ell_p$ norm. For each $(x,y)$ pair above, I ran a Monte Carlo search testing 10000 randomly generated bivectors and took the best one; after a few tries everything converged to the plot above. If you start with $(x,y,0)$ instead, you seem to get the basic GCD function instead, but $(x,y,1)$ gives the ""smooth nega-GCD"" pattern above.

3230408,If $f_n \to f$ in $L^p$ and $g_n \xrightarrow{a.e.} g$ in $L^\infty$ then $f_ng_n \to fg$ in $L^p$,"Exercise : Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ be open and bounded, $\{f_n\}_{n \geq 1} \subseteq L^p(\Omega)$ with $1<p< \infty$ and $\{g_n\}_{n \geq 1} \subseteq L^\infty(\Omega)$ . If it is $f_n \to f$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ and $g_n \xrightarrow{a.e.} g$ in $L^\infty(\Omega)$ while $\{g_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ is also bounded then show $f_ng_n \to fg$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ . Attempt : Since $\{g_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ is bounded, then it would be $\|g_n\|_\infty \leq M$ for some $M>0$ and thus for the $p$ -norm it would be $\|g_n\|_p \leq M$ as well. Now, it is : \begin{align*}
\|fg - f_ng_n\|_p &= \|fg - fg_n + fg_n - f_ng_n\|_p \\ &\leq \|fg-fg_n\|_p + \|g_n(f-f_n)\|_p \\ &\leq \|fg-fg_n\|_p + M\|f-f_n\|_p 
\end{align*} The second term goes to $0$ as $f_n \to f$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ . Now, since $g_n \xrightarrow{a.e.} g$ we can also deduce that $\|g_n\|_\infty \xrightarrow{a.e.} \|g\|_\infty$ . For the first term : \begin{align*}
\|fg-fg_n\|_p &= \left(\int_\Omega|fg-fg_n|^p\mathrm{d}x \right)^{1/p} \\ &\leq \left[ \int_\Omega \left(|fg| + |fg_n|\right)^p\mathrm{d}x\right]^{1/p} \\ &\leq \left[ \int_\Omega \left(|fg| + M|f|\right)^p\mathrm{d}x\right]^{1/p}
\end{align*} I can't see how to continue on though to prove that this term can become arbitrarily small, thus that $\|fg-f_ng_n\|_p \to 0$ and thus the desired convergence. Any hints or elaborations will be greatly appreciated ! Edit : I worked it around myself as such : \begin{align*}
\|f(g_n-g)\|_p &= \left(\int_\Omega |(g_n-g)f|^p\mathrm{d}x\right)^{1/p} \\ &\leq \left(\int_\Omega ||g_n-g\|_\infty^p|f|^p\mathrm{d}x\right)^p \\ &= \|g_n-g\|_\infty\left(\int_\Omega |f|^p\mathrm{d}x \right)^p \to 0

I would like to know if there are better or more creative approaches on the problem. Here are my solutions: (1st solution): Notice that $$x^{2} = (\frac{\sqrt{111}-1}{2})^{2} =  28 - \frac{\sqrt{111}}{2}$$ $$x^{3} = x \cdot x^{2} = \left( \frac{\sqrt{111}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( 28 - \frac{\sqrt{111}}{2} \right) =  14 \sqrt{111} - 111/4 - 14 + \frac{\sqrt{111}}{4} = \frac{57 \sqrt{111}}{4} - \frac{167}{4} $$ $$x^{4} =  (x^{2})^{2} =   \frac{ 111 + 4 \cdot 784}{4} - 28 \sqrt{111}  $$ $$x^{5} = x^{4} \cdot x = \left( \frac{ 111 + 4 \cdot 784}{4} - 28 \sqrt{111} \right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{111}-1}{2} \right) =  \left( \frac{ 3247 }{4} - 28 \sqrt{111} \right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{111}-1}{2} \right) $$ $$ = \sqrt{111}\frac{3359}{8}  - \frac{15679}{8}  $$ So we have $$ 2x^{5} + 2x^{4} - 53x^{3} - 57x + 54 = $$ $$(\sqrt{111}\frac{3359}{4}  - \frac{15679}{4}) + (\frac{ 111 + 4 \cdot 784}{2} - 56 \sqrt{111}) - 53 (\frac{57 \sqrt{111}}{4} - \frac{167}{4}) - 57 (\frac{\sqrt{111}-1}{2})  + 54 $$ $$ = \sqrt{111} (\frac{3359}{4}  - \frac{3359}{4})  - \frac{15679}{4} + \frac{ 111 + 4 \cdot 784}{2} + \frac{53 \cdot 167}{4} + \frac{57}{2} + 54 $$ $$ = - \frac{15679}{4} + \frac{ 222 + 8 \cdot 784}{4} + \frac{53 \cdot 167}{4} + \frac{114}{4} + \frac{216}{4}  $$ $$ = - \frac{15679}{4} + \frac{ 5600 + 894 }{4} + \frac{5300 + 3180 + 371 }{4} + \frac{114}{4} + \frac{216}{4}  $$ $$ = - \frac{15679}{4} + \frac{ 6494 }{4} + \frac{8851}{4} + \frac{114}{4} + \frac{216}{4} $$ $$ = -4/4 = -1, $$ and the answer is $ (-1)^{2004} = 1.$ The above solution requires quite tedious calculation. Below is an alternative solution. (2nd solution): Notice that $x = \frac{\sqrt{111}-1}{2}$ is equivalent with $$ (2x + 1)^{2} = 111$$ $$ 4x^{2} + 4x + 1 = 111 $$ $$ 4x^{2} + 4x - 110 = 0$$ $$ (2x^{2} + 2x - 55) = 0 \:\: ........ \:\: (1)$$ Multiply $(1)$ with $x^{3}$ we get $$ (2x^{5} + 2x^{4} - 55x^{3}) = 0 $$ Multiply $(1)$ with $x$ we get $$ (2x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 55x) = 0 $$ Sum both of them and we get: $$ 2x^{5} + 2x^{4} - 53 x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 55x = 0  \:\: ........ \:\: (2)$$ and now we have the 1st 3 terms of the form that we want to calculate.

Inverse function for a power function $y = x^{2.2}$ will be just the power reversed $x = y^{1/2.2}$ . Since we adding an increasing and a decreasing function, the resulting curvature has changed. And it raises the suspicion that there might even be an exact power value, smaller than the original 2.2... After writing this, I realized that the problem can be expressed in a different way. What I actually did is that I made an inverse function for an approximation of $f(x)$ : $$f_{approx}(x) = 2^{-1.2}+ (1-2^{-1.2}) (2x-1)^{1.983}$$ Now I made a different illustration: https://www.geogebra.org/graphing/msfzaqah ( image ). There is also $h(x) = \frac{f_{approx}(x)}{f(x)}$ on the illustration. It clearly has some extremes, and changing the power just pushes them around. So the answer to the original question must be: this approximation doesn't fit the function exactly, so there is no exact number to put in there. Now the question is: can the original function be expressed as something invertible? Same shape functions with an integer power are invertible. What stands in the way for a function with non-integer (fractional) power to be invertible too? Note: For powers 2 and 3, similar functions can be expressed in a clearly invertible form: $$x^2+(1-x)^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(2x - 1)^2$$ $$x^3+(1-x)^3 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}(2x - 1)^2$$ For the power of 4 and above WolframAlpha doesn't provide a form like this (single power), but still able to construct inverse functions, albeit more and more complicated. Interesting that for powers of 2 and 3 the resulting function has the power of 2. And this fact seems to persist for higher powers - a sum of (2n+1) power functions will be a (2n) power function. But that's a digression. Update 2: I really appreciate the answers about Tailor series expansion. But I'm still concerned: is it the best we can do?","['exponentiation', 'functions', 'inverse', 'inverse-function']"
3231030,Check whether $f \mapsto f+ \frac{df}{dx}$ is injective or surjective,Consider maps $C^{\infty} \to C^{\infty}$ s.t $f \mapsto f+ \frac{df}{dx}$ . We have to check whether this map is injective or surjective. My try: The map is clearly not injective as $x$ and $x+e^{-x}$ maps to $x+1$ . Now to check whether the map is surjective. Consider $g \in C^{\infty}$ . Then I was thinking in this way that considering $\int_0^xg$ then $f=g-\int_0^xg$ now $f+\frac{df}{dx}=g-\int_0^xg+\frac{dg}{dx}-g=-\int_0^xg+\frac{dg}{dx}$ still I am not getting a proof whether it is surjective or not.,"['integration', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
3231060,What would be the number of inequivalent $6$-colourings of the faces of a cube?,"Consider the different ways to colour a cube with $6$ given colours such that each face will be given a single colour and all the six colours will be used. Define two such colourings to be equivalent if one will get from another just by rotation. Then what would be the number of inequivalent colourings? The answer is given $30$ . But I was trying to prove it by choosing the colour in the two opposite sides. For example, first let us choose the colours on the two opposite sides in $^6C_2$ ways, then another two opposite sides in $^4C_2$ ways, and the leftover sides in $^2C_2$ ways. So, in total, we get $15 \times 6=90$ , but I think I am triple-counting the situation or thinking it in a wrong way. Please help.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3231073,Kronecker Product Interpretation,The algebraic expression for a Kronecker product is simple enough.  Is there some way to understand what this product is? The expression for matrix-vector multiplication is easy enough to understand.  But realizing that the multiplication yields a linear combination of the columns of the matrix is a useful insight. Is there some analogous insight for the Kronecker product?,"['linear-algebra', 'tensor-products', 'kronecker-product']"
3231122,Find $n$ integers from $3n$ ones,"$n$ is a positive integer. Is the following statement true? For any $3n$ integers, saying $\{b_1,..,b_{3n}\}$ . There exists $n$ of them, saying $\{a_1,..,a_n\}$ ,so that $\forall$ $1\leq i,j,k\leq n$ we have $a_i+a_j\neq a_k$ . Here $i,j,k$ is not necessary to be different. I tried to mod them by $3$ and use Principle of tolerance, but it does not help when most of them divided by $3$ . I also get some easy inequality by considering some possible trivial condition, for example if $b_l$ are ranked from small to big, if $2b_m\geq b_{m+n}$ for some $m$ . I can take $\{b_m,..,b_{m+n-1}\}$ as desired. Any help will be appreciated.","['integers', 'combinatorics']"

3231253,"Differentiation applied in Physics, need to clear a little doubt.","So, again my over-curiosity arose a problem for me, this time in Physics class. Being able to solve the questions sir gave me before the time limit, I was told to solve another, a little tougher. This is the exact words of my Physics Teacher : ""A particle of unit mass undergoes $1$ -dimensional motion such that its velocity expressed as a function of its position is: $$V(x) = bx^{-2n}$$ where, $b$ and $n$ are constants, and $x$ denotes the position of the particle.
Prove that, Acceleration $a$ varies with $x$ ."" Now, I spent a lot of time and came up with this : $$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right)\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)$$ By definition, $\frac{dx}{dt} = V(t)$ . But Velocity is expressed as a function of position, not time. Despite that, I went ahead and put $V(x)$ . That gave me $$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right)\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)$$ $$= \frac{d}{dx}(bx^{-2n}) * V(x)$$ $$= -2nbx^{-2n - 1} * bx^{-2n}$$ $$= -2nb^2x^{-4n - 1}$$ My teacher said I was correct. But what about $V(t)$ ? The function I put into calculation is $V(x)$ , not the $V(t)$ we're supposed to put normally. Is $V(x) = V(t)$ ? If it is, How can we prove it? How can we proceed with this?","['calculus', 'derivatives']"
