917003,Width of the Eiffel Tower as a function of height?,"In the preface of Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 2nd Ed. by Zill and Cullen, it is claimed that the function relating the width of the Eiffel Tower as to the distance from its top, $x \mapsto f(x)$, is given by the solution of the following equation: $$
af(x)\int_0^{x}f(t)^2\,dt=x\int_0^x f(t)\,dt - \int_0^x tf(t)\,dt

917013,Can we characterize the space of functions which is real analytic but not real entire?,"A complex valued function $F,$ defined on  an open set $E$ in the plane $\mathbb R^{2}$ , is said to be real-analytic in $E$ if to every point $(s_{0}, t_{0})$ in there corresponds an expansion with complex coefficients $$F(s, t)= \sum_{n,m=0}^{\infty} a_{nm}(s-s_{0})^{m} (t-t_{0})^{n},$$ which converges absolutely for all $(s,t)$ in some neighbourhood of $(s_{0}, t_{0}).$ If $F$ is defined in the whole plane $\mathbb R^{2}$ by a series $$F(s, t)= \sum_{n,m=0}^{\infty} a_{nm}s^{m} t^{n},$$ which converges absolutely for every $(s,t),$ the we call $F$ real-entire . Let us introduce temporary notations, $$RA(\mathbb R^{2}):=\text{The space of real analytic functions on $\mathbb R^{2}$},$$ and $$RE(\mathbb R^{2}):=\text{The space of real entire functions on $\mathbb R^{2}$}$$ Note . We note that, $RE(\mathbb R^{2}) \subset RA(\mathbb R^{2}).$ Example . There exists $$f(s,t) = \frac{1}{(1+s^{2}) (1+t^{2})}, (s,t \in \mathbb R).$$ is real- analytic in the whole plane $\mathbb R^{2}$ but not real-entire; that is, $f\in RA(\mathbb R^{2})$ but $f\notin RE(\mathbb R^{2}).$ My naive questions are : (1) How one can construct few more examples $f$ so that $f\in  RA(\mathbb R^{2})$ but $f\notin RE(\mathbb R^{2})$ ? (2) Can we think of some well-known function space say $E$ , so that, $E\subset RA(\mathbb R^{2})\setminus RE(\mathbb R^{2})$ ?

917026,Every analytic subset of $\Bbb{R}$ is the projection of a $G_\delta$ set $G \subset \Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R}$,"In the answer to this question , respectively in this post it is claimed that every analytic subset of $\Bbb{R}$ is the projection of a $G_\delta$ set. My definition of an analytic set comes from Dudley, Real Analysis and Probability, Theorem 13.2.1. This theorem shows that for a Polish space $Y$ (e.g. $Y = \Bbb{R}$ ), the following conditions are equivalent (for $\emptyset \neq A \subset Y$ ): $A = f(\Bbb{N}^\infty)$ for some continuous $f$ . $A = f(\Bbb{N}^\infty)$ for some Borel measurable $f$ . $A = f(X)$ for some Polish space $X$ and continuous $f$ . $A = f(X)$ for some Polish space $X$ and Borel measurable $f$ . $A = f(B)$ for some Borel set $B$ in a Polish space $X$ and $f : B \to Y$ continuous. $A = f(B)$ for some Borel set $B$ in a Polish space $X$ and $f : B \to Y$ Borel measurable. A set $A$ for which this is true is called an analytic subset $A$ of $Y$ . I can show that each analytic subset $\emptyset \neq A \subset \Bbb{R}$ is the projection of some Borel set $B \subset \Bbb{R}^2$ , because we also know from Dudley, Theorem 13.1.1 that $\Bbb{N}^\infty$ is Borel-isomorphic to $\Bbb{R}$ . Let $\Phi : \Bbb{R} \to \Bbb{N}^\infty$ denote the Borel-isomorphism. So if $A = f(\Bbb{N}^\infty)$ for some Borel-measurable $f : \Bbb{N}^\infty \to \Bbb{R}$ , then $$
A = (f\circ \Phi)(\Bbb{R}) = \pi_2 (\mathrm{graph}(f \circ \Phi)).
$$ But Lemma 13.2.2 in Dudley shows that the graph of a Borel-measurable function is a Borel-measurable subset of the product space. However, this only shows that $A$ is the projection of a Borel-set $B\subset \Bbb{R}^2$ , it does not show that we can take $B$ to be a $G_\delta$ set. So my question is: Is it indeed true that each analytic subset of $\Bbb{R}$ (or more generally of any polish space $X$ ) is the projection of a $G_\delta$ subset $G \subset \Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R}$ (or of $X \times X$ )? If so, can you provide a (more or less) elementary proof or a hint to a location, where I might find such a proof?","['measure-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"

If the decimal expansion of $n$ ends in a $0$, $1$, $5$ or $6$ then the same is true for the decimal expansions of $n^k$ ($k \geq 1$). My question is whether there is any other positive
  integer $n$ (not congruent to $0$, $1$, $5$ or $6$ modulo $10$) such
  that there is some digit that occurs in all powers of $n$. A computer search shows that if such an $n$ were to exist, it should have at least $3$ digits.  For example, $99$ does not have the desired property as $$99^{18} = 834513761450087614416078625185528201$$
does not contain a $9$. Perhaps a number such as $102$ will work, as $102^k$ starts with a $1$ for small $k$ and has a lot of digits for large $k$, so ""probably"" one of them will be a $1$.

I feel that the 'correct' answer given by the course is wrong - I do not want to paste it here because it may violate the Course Agreement (even though the course ended 3 months ago). ""Why is it impossible to find natural numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $12b^2=a^2$?"" Can you please look at my reasoning and tell me what is missing? My attempt: Assume it is possible to find natural numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $12b^2=a^2$ Then $$3 = \frac{a^2}{2^2\cdot b^2}$$ Implies that $a^2$ is even. The prime factorization of $a^2$ will contain $2\cdot 2$. Assume $a = 2\cdot c$ where $c$ is odd. So
$$3 = \frac{c^2}{b^2}$$ Now $b^2$ is also odd. But it does not mean that the prime factors of $b$ and $c$ contain $3$.

917141,How to prove that all zeros of the complex polynomial $P(z)$ lie in $\Bbb{D}$?,"I want to know how to prove that all zeros of the polynomial $P(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z| \leqslant 1$. Where 
$$P(z)=z^{n+1}+\frac{2(n+1)\cos\alpha}{n+2}z^{n}+\frac{n}{n+2}z^{n-1}+\frac{2 e^{-i \theta}}{n+2}z +\frac{2e^{-i \theta}\cos\alpha}{ n+2}$$
$n\geqslant 1,\pi/2 \leqslant\alpha < \pi,\theta\in \mathbb{R}$. We can write $P(z)$ as
$$\begin{split}
P(z)&=\left(z^{n+1}+\frac{n}{n+2}z^{n-1}+\frac{2 e^{-i \theta}}{n+2}z\right) +\left(\frac{2(n+1)\cos\alpha}{n+2}z^{n}+\frac{2e^{-i \theta}\cos\alpha}{ n+2}\right)\\
&=:\psi(z)+\phi(z)
\end{split}$$
where $\psi(z)=z^{n+1}+\frac{n}{n+2}z^{n-1}+\frac{2e^{-i\theta}}{n+2}z$ and $\phi(z)=\frac{2(n+1)\cos\alpha}{n+2}z^{n}+\frac{2e^{-i\theta}\cos\alpha}{n+2}$. By Cohn's Rule , we can prove that all zeros of $\psi(z)$ are lie in  the closed unit disk $|z| \leqslant 1$. On the unit circle $|z|=1$, since $\frac{\pi}{2} \leqslant \alpha<\pi$, one can find that
\begin{split}
|\psi(z)|=\left|\frac{2(n+1+e^{-i\theta})}{n+2}\right|>\left|\frac{2(n+1+e^{-i\theta})\cos\alpha}{n+2}\right|=|\phi(z)|.

Then by Rouche’s theorem , we know that $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)=\psi(z)+\phi(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside the unit circle $|z|=1$. Now my amazement is if some zeros of $\psi(z)$ lie on the unit cicle, can we show that some zeros of $P(z)$ lie on the unit cicle $|z|=1$, also? In other words, If all zeros of  $\psi(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$, can we prove that all zeros of $P(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$? For example: If we take $n=10, \cos\alpha=-\frac{5}{6},e^{-i\theta}=i$, then $\psi(z)=z^{11}+\frac{5}{6}z^{9}+\frac{i}{6}z$ and $P(z)=z^{11} - \frac{55}{36} z^{10} + \frac{5}{6} z^9 + \frac{i}{6}z - \frac{5i}{36}$ , and all zeros distribution of  $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)$ are illustrated by the following images.

 $\psi(z)$ Zeros distribution of 
 $P(z)$ We can see that all zeros of $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$. But how to prove it? Ask for help!","['complex-geometry', 'roots', 'complex-analysis', 'polynomials']"

That is to say, I measure the velocity in six different ways, each of which gives me a slightly different answer.

Stokes' Theorem allows us to replace the required integral with $\int_{S} \text{Curl}\vec{F} \cdot \hat{n} dS$, where $S$ is a surface bounded by $C$, and $\hat{n}$ is a normal to that surface.

Inductive step: Suppose that $f(k)$ has been defined for some $k\ge 1$ Let $f(k+1)$ be the least element of the set $\{a\in A | a> f(k)\}$. To see $f$ is a surjection notice that $f(n)\ge n$. Given an element $a\in A$ then let $m$ be the least integer such that $f(m)\ge a$[we must have $m\le a$ since $f(a) \ge a$]. Then, by the definition of $f$ we have $f(m)=a$.

917366,defining smooth functions on smooth manifolds,"The standard approach to defining smooth functions $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ on a topological manifold $M$ equipped with a smooth structure (i.e., a maximal smooth atlas) $\mathcal{A}$ is the following. Say a function $f$ is smooth at $p\in M$ if there exists a coordinate chart $(U,\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in U$ and $$f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi(U)\to\mathbb{R}$$ is smooth. (Say $M$ is $n$-dimensional, so that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\phi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.) It is then supposed to be a simple exercise that the smoothness of $f$ at $p$ doesn't depend on the choice of chart $(U,\phi)$, in the sense that $f$ will be smooth in all charts $(V,\theta)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $p\in V$. (Lang, for example, says ""One sees then immediately..."" See the photo at the end of this post.) I take this to mean that if $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is smooth for some $(U,\phi)$, then for any $V$ such that $p\in V$, we have $$\boxed{f\circ\theta^{-1}:\theta(V)\to\mathbb{R}}$$
is smooth. Here is where I'm confused. I know how the proof is supposed to go: you use the fact that chart transformations must be smooth (by the definition of the smooth atlas), writing $$f\circ\theta^{-1}=(\underbrace{f\circ\phi^{-1}}_{:=\alpha})\circ(\underbrace{\phi\circ\theta^{-1}}_{:=\beta})$$
By assumption, $\alpha$ is smooth, and $\beta$ is smooth because it is a chart transformation. Indeed the point of requiring smooth chart transitions is precisely to make this argument go through. But the problem I'm having is with domains. The function $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ is defined on all of $\theta(V)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, whereas the chart transformation $\beta$ is defined only on the smaller domain $\theta(U\cap V)\subset\theta(V)$. So I don't see how $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ can be defined on all of $\theta(V)$, and that seems to be what I need to check (per the box above). So my question is: how exactly is this argument supposed to go? Do I need define $f\circ\theta^{-1}$ piecewise as $\alpha\circ\beta$ on $\theta(U\cap V)$ together with some other definition on $\theta(V)-\theta(U\cap V)$? I think I'm missing something very simple, but I can't see it. This issue has bothered me for years. Lang's definition:",['differential-geometry']

Then $|\mathfrak{O}_K/G|^2$ divides $\Delta[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n]$. Proposition 2.21: Suppose that $G\neq{\mathfrak{O}_K}$.

917552,defining smooth functions on manifolds *without* smooth chart transitions,"Let $M$ be a topological manifold, covered by an atlas of charts ${(U,\phi_U)}$ (which are homeomorphisms into Euclidean space), and let $p\in M$. Say a function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ is smooth at $p$ if $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is smooth for all charts in the atlas that contain $p$. (Note that this definition says nothing about smooth chart transitions on the domain where two charts overlap.) This definition is enough to pick out a collection of smooth functions on $M$. So it must be that we don't need the apparatus of smooth atlases, i.e. atlases composed of charts with smooth transitions, just to talk about the collection of smooth functions on a manifold. So what do we need the extra structure for? In other words, why is this a bad definition? What do we want/need it do that it does not allow us to do? (Note that ""it doesn't allow us to talk about smooth chart transitions,"" by itself, is not an answer: it doesn't explain what we need that condition for .) For a concrete example, take $M$ to be the interval $(-2,2)\subset\mathbb{R}$ with charts $$U=(-2,1),\phi_U(x)=x\,\,\,\text{(so $\phi_U^{-1}=x$)}$$
and
$$V=(-1,2),\phi_V(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\,\,\,\text{(so $\phi_V^{-1}=x^3$)}$$
This is a topological manifold equipped with an atlas. And the definition above allows us to say which functions are smooth at, say, $x=0$ on $M$. For example, $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ is not smooth at $x=0$ according to the definition, because it fails to be smooth using the chart $U$. However, $f(x)=x$ is smooth in both charts. EDIT: I realize that one reason this definition is bad is that it requires us to check smoothness of $f$ in all charts in the atlas, whereas smooth transitions allow us to check only in one chart. I'm not dissatisfied with that response as a basis for rejecting this definition; I'm just interested in what this structure does entail, and how else it might be pathological or deviate from the usual definition. (I'm basically trying to understand how to pick out the usual notion of smoothness as requiring an atlas with smooth transitions from alternative definitions of smoothness. This is one alternative.)","['differential-geometry', 'definition']"

For example, $$\cos\left(\frac\theta2\right)=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(\theta)}{2}}.$$ Then what is $\cos(\frac\theta3)$ equal to? I tried to figure it out then I realized that I needed to find the root of a cubic polynomial. Then I realized that I'm better at staying focused than finding the roots of cubic polynomials. Anyways, a proof would be nice here. I really appreciate any hints or answers. I apologize for my digressions!","['trigonometry', 'inequality', 'real-analysis']"

    sum += N/i-1; I am getting the correct answer. But one solution I saw by somebody which I could not understand which is : for (int i=1; i<=sqrt(N); i++) 
    sum += N/i;

ans = 2*sum - sqrt(N)*sqrt(N) - N How this formula can be derived, I am not able to get that. Please help me in this regard. To explain it in more clear way : The number of integers in $\{1, ..., N\}$ that are divisible by $i$ (excluding $i$ itself) equals $N/i - 1$. For example, $N = 5$, there are $5/1$ (i.e. $5$) numbers $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ which are divisible by $1$ and there are $5/2$ (i.e. $2$) numbers $(2, 4)$ which are divisible by $2$ For calculating the total number of pairs, I am adding all the values $(N/i - 1)$ where $i\ge 1$ and $N/i > 1$. for example, For N=5, 
    sum = (5/1 - 1) + (5/2 - 1) = 4 + 1 = 5

for N = 6,
    sum = (6/1 - 1) + (6/2 - 1) + (6/3 - 1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 This is giving correct answer. But I saw one solution which is like this : First it is adding all the values $N/i$ where $1\le i\le \text{sqrt}(N)$. for example, For N=6, 
    sum = 6/1 + 6/2 = 6 + 3 = 9 Then it is calculating the answer as: ans = 2*sum - sqrt(N)*sqrt(N) - N    (*)

    = 2*9 - 2*2 - 6 = 8 NB : In all of the above, the $/$ mark denotes integer division , i.e. $N/i := \left \lfloor \frac{N}{i}\right\rfloor$, and $\text{sqrt}$ denotes integer square root , i.e. $\text{sqrt}(N) = \left \lfloor \sqrt{N} \right\rfloor$. Can anyone help me how to derive the formula (*)?

918245,A game involving Even and Odd functions,"I was doodling around today and thought of this fun game. Two players take alternate turns playing this game. A function from now on refers to real valued functions with domain $\mathbb R$, and Odd and Even functions have the usual meaning. A function $F$ is said to be complimentary to a function $H$, if one of the following is true:- $F$ is Odd when $H$ is Even. $F$ is Even when $H$ is Odd. The first player starts with a function $h_n$, which is either Odd or Even. The second player is said to make a move when he/she provides another function $g$ along with an operation $*$, (where $*$ is one of $+,-,\times,\circ$), so as to create a function $h_{n+1} = h_n*g$ or $h_{n+1}=g*h_n$ such that $g$ is complimentary to $h_n$ and in accordance with the rules (stated below). Moves are made alternately between the two players, and the player who is unable to make a move loses. Rules $h_n$ is added to a set $V$ for each $n$. $\forall g_1,g_2,.... \in V$ and $\forall a_1,a_2,.... \in \mathbb R$, $(a_1g_1^n+a_2g_2^n+....)$ is added to $V$, where $n \in \mathbb N$ and $g_k^n = {g_k} \times {g_k} \times  \cdots g_k$ $n$ times. If $g \in V,$ $g$ cannot be used in a move. At the end of each move, the function used by the player is added to $V$. The $*$ provided by the player cannot be used in consecutive moves. Example Player 1: $h_1(x)=x$, which is Odd. Player 2: $g(x)=|x|$ and $* = \circ$ so that $h_2(x) = (h_1 \circ g)(x) = |x|$, which is Even. Player 1: $g(x)=sin(x)$ and $*=\times$ so that $h_3(x)=h_2(x)\times g(x) = |x|sin(x),$ which is Odd. Player 2: $g(x) = cos(x)$ and $* = \circ$ so that $h_4(x) = (g \circ h_3)(x) = cos(|x|sin(x))$, which is Even. And it goes on... I don't know much of higher mathematics to analyze this game, so I would appreciate it if someone could answer the following questions which I had in mind:- Are the rules well defined?

$$g:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow \text{Im}(f)$$
where:
$$g(q)=f(q)$$
and since $\text{Im}(f)$ is also denumerable, there is a bijection, $i:\text{Im}(f)\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$.
Hence, we can construct a bijection $f\circ g:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow \text{Im}(f) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ which proves that $Q$ is denumerable too.

918494,Nested Sum Encountered in Maclaurin Expansion of $e^{-x^2}$,"In the course of working out the Maclaurin expansions of $e^{-x^2}$ and $cos(x^2)$, I ran into the following nested sum: $$ \underbrace{ \sum_{a=0}^1 \left( a \sum_{b=0}^{a+1} b \left( \sum_{c=0}^{b+1} c \cdots d \sum_{e=0}^{d+1} \left( e \sum_{f=0}^{e+1} f \right) \right) \right) }_{\text{n sums deep}} $$ To illustrate, for $n=4$ the above will expand to $$ 1(2(3(4+3+2+1)+2(3+2+1)+1(2+1))+1(2(3+2+1)+1(2+1))) $$ Then from looking at a hand calculation of the first few terms and guessing the pattern, it looks like the above should be equal to $$ \prod_{k=1}^n (2k-1) $$ Indeed, I numerically confirmed equality up to $n=16$, but haven't had luck at finding a proof yet.

918557,Question about initial value problem,"This seems like it should be something simple. While solving some HW problems I ran across this: $dy/dx = ({1-2x})/y$ which I separated and integrated: $\int{Ydy} = \int{1-2x}dx$ $y^2/2= x-x^2 + c$ $y^2=2(x-x^2+c)$ $y=\sqrt{2(x-x^2+c)}$ $y=\sqrt{2x-2x^2+2c}$ I was given $y(1)=-2$ and asked to solve. So i did this: $-2=\sqrt{2(1)-2(1^2)+2c}$ $-2=\sqrt{2-2+2c}$ $-2=\sqrt{2c}$ So, I assumed c must be some complex number? However, the final solution given by the book pops a negative sign into the equation and just has $c=2$, so the solution looks like this: $y=-\sqrt{2x-2x^2+2c}$ where $c=2$ $y=-\sqrt{2x-2x^2+4}$ which is obviously a true statement. I'm just confused where the negative sign on the right side of the equation came from.  I'm sure its some silly algebra thing I keep overlooking.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"

918632,"In composition of two mappings, can the outer mapping access the arguments of the inner mapping?","In composition of two mappings, can the outer mapping access the arguments of the inner mapping? Here is an example to illustrate my question and my thought. E.g. $f: \cup_{n \in \mathbb N} \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ is taking
sum, i.e.  $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) =  \sum_i x_i$. Note here $n$ can
vary in $\mathbb N$. $g: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is to further divide the sum by the
sample size, to get the sample mean , i.e. $g(f(x_1, \dots, x_n)) =
\sum_i x_i/n$. Is $g(f(x_1, \dots, x_n))$ a composition of the two mappings $f$ and
$g$? I think that in a  composition of two mappings, the outer mapping 
only acts on the codomain of the inner mapping, and thus shouldn't
know the input to the inner mapping. In the example, $g$ should not
know  $n$. So it doesn't make sense to  compose $f$ and $g$. A revision would be $f: \cup_{n \in \mathbb N} \mathbb R^n \to
\mathbb  R \times \mathbb N$ with $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) =  [\sum_i
x_i, n]^T$, and $g: \mathbb  R \times \mathbb N \to \mathbb R$ with
$g(x,n) = x/n$. Only then the composition of $f$ and $g$ would make
sense to me. What would you think? The question comes from statistics, where $f$ is a ""statistic"" which
takes in a sample of size $n$, and $n$ can vary in $\mathbb N$, and
$g$ is a transform on the statistic. To see more of my specific
question, please refer to https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114240/can-the-measurable-mapping-in-the-definition-of-complete-statistics-depend-on-sa . Here at math.se, I ask a more general question for general math. In

Something is bugging me in the above question. If a sequence converges then all its sub-sequences converge towards the same limit. Therefore we have $l\in\mathbb{C}$ such that : Let $e>0,\exists n_0\in\mathbb{N},\forall n\geq n_0, |U_{2n}-l|\leq
 e\text{ and }|U_{2n+1}-l|\leq e$ Thus $\forall n\geq 2n_0+1, |U_n-l|\leq e$ Therefore $(u_n)_{n_\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges.
