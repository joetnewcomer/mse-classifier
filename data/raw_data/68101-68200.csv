817093,Angle between two vectors on manifold,"I'm parallel transporting a vector along a curve and trying to calculate how much this vector rotates relative to the curve's tangent vector.  So if the path is a geodesic then I will get an answer of zero. I have looked at paths that are not geodesics and calculated the end form of the vector.  I now want to compare it to its original form. My textbooks says that if two vectors ($\Bbb{X},\Bbb{Y}$) are at the same point then the angle between them is: $\cos(\theta)=\frac{<\Bbb{X},\Bbb{Y}>}{|\Bbb{X}|\cdot |\Bbb{Y}|}$ I was wondering if I'm allowed to do this if the vectors are not at the same point i.e. I want to compare the starting vector to its end form even though they are at different places. My thoughts: intuitively it makes sense that this is possible.  Between the vector's start and end points there is a geodesic.  I could parallel transport the vector to the end point via this geodesic.  The angle of my vector to the geodesic's tangent will be preserved.  Now I could compare this vector to the vector obtained via the non-geodesic path.  Would this give me the same answer as if I just used the above formula?

817114,Can Lagrange multipliers be used to give a good bound on the number of critical points?,"I will explain my problem by illustrating a simple case. Easy question: Let $f(x,y)$ be a ""generic"" polynomial in two variables, of total degree $\le D$. What's a good upper bound for how many critical points (minimum/maximum) it has in $\mathbb R^2$? Solution: The critical points satisfy $\nabla f = 0$, so we can try to count the combined zeroes of the two polynomials $\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}$, both of degree $\le D$. We assume they're both irreducible ($f$ is ""generic""), and Bezout's theorem says there are at most $D^2$ solutions. Harder question: What's a good upper bound for how many critical points $f$ has on a given straight line $Ax + By = C$? (i.e. minimum/maximum subject to the constraint $Ax + By = C$.) Approach #1: Lagrange multipliers. Each critical point satisfies $\nabla f = (\lambda A, \lambda B)$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb R$. So we have a system of 3 equations $$\cases{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}=\lambda A \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\lambda B \\ Ax+By=C}$$
in 3 variables $x,y,\lambda$. The first two equations are polynomial of degree at most $D$ and the last one is of degree $1$. By Bezout, there are at most $D^2$ solutions. Approach #2: Parameterize the line. Suppose the line is given by $y=Px+Q$. Define a function $g(t)=f(t,Pt+Q)$. This is a ""generic"" polynomial in one variable of degree $\le D$. By ""Bezout"" (or just elementary algebra) there are at most $D$ solutions to $g'(t)=0$. My question: Clearly Approach #2 gave a better result. However, I want to apply this in a harder scenario where there are more variables, more constraints, and some of the constraints are non-linear. In this scenario it seems ""ugly"" to parameterize the constraints like I did in approach #2, and very nice and clean to use Lagrange multipliers. But I want a better result. How do I modify the Lagrange multiplier approach to get the better bound, while avoiding parameterizing the curve (line)?","['multivariable-calculus', 'algebraic-geometry', 'calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier']"
817146,Compute a probability in Random Walk by Martingales,"Let $X_n$ be the state at time $n$ of a Markov chain with these transition probabilities :
  $$p_{i,i+1}=p_i\qquad,\qquad p_{i,i-1}=q_i=1-p_i$$
  $(a)$ Show that $Z_n=g(X_n)\,;\,n\geq0$, is a martingale with respect to $X_n\,;\,n\geq0$, when $g(1)=1$, and
  $$g(j)=1+\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\frac{q_1\cdots q_i}{p_1\cdots p_i}\,;\,j\geq 2$$
  $(b)$ Find the probability, starting in state $i$, that the chain reaches $n$ before $0$, where $0<i<n$. **#** from Ross , Probability Models for Computer Science I've proved part $(a)$ easily, and wrote it for upcoming needed information. For part $(b)$, despite Martingale approach, I think it's a good idea to find a recursive relation to find the desired probability, like we do for Gambler's Ruin Problem , as follows : Let $a_k$ be the such probability, starting from state $1\leq k\leq n-1$. Now we can write : 
$$(p_k+q_k)a_k=a_k=p_k.a_{k+1}+q_k.a_{k-1}\Longrightarrow 
\frac{p_k}{q_k}=\frac{a_{k+1}-a_k}{a_k-a_{k-1}}\tag{*}$$
We can also manually define $a_0=0,a_n=1$. But from now I don't know there's any way to extract a formula for $a_k$. Please help me HERE ! Coming back to Martingales,
if we define $N=\min\{t\geq 0|X_t=n\vee X_t=0\}$, then $N$ is a Stopping-Time for $Z_i$ and : $Z_N=\left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
g(n)&\text{with probability $p$}\\
g(0)&\text{with probability $q$}
\end{array} \right.$. where $p$ is the probability chain reaches $n$ before $0$ and $q$ is the probability chain reaches $0$ before $n$.
 Hence by Stopping Time Theorem , 
$$p.g(n)+q.g(0)=\mathbb{E}[Z_N]=\mathbb{E}[Z_0]=\mathbb{E}[g(i)]=g(i)\tag{**}$$
But $q=1-p$( why? ), intuitively because of positively recurrence of the subchain $\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$.
Therefore, $\:p$ will be derived from $(**)$","['stochastic-processes', 'martingales', 'markov-chains', 'recursion', 'probability-theory']"

$$ My Attempt If $c \in \mathbb{Q}$ then there is a sequence $c_n \notin \mathbb{Q}$ with $ cn \rightarrow c$ and $f$ being continuous at $c$ requires $$\lim_{n \to \infty}f(c_n)=\lim_{n \to \infty}sin(c_n)=sin(c)=0=f(c)$$ Now this condition is only necessary not sufficient. On the otherhand, if $c \notin \mathbb{Q}$ then there's a sequence $c_n \in \mathbb{Q}$  with  $c_n \rightarrow c$ and just as above the necessary condition is;
$$\lim_{n \to \infty}f(c_n)=\lim_{n \to \infty}0=0=sin(c)=f(c)$$ for $f$ to be continuous at $c$. So we know that $f$ is discontinuous at all points $[0,2 \pi]$ except possibly at points where $0=sin(c)$ i.e $c=0$ $c= \pi$ and $c=2\pi$ Since the conditions above are only necessary not sufficient we cannot immediately conclude that $f$ is continuous at these points we need to verify; i.e at $c=\pi$ $$\lim_{x \to \pi}f(x)=f(\pi)=sin(\pi)=0$$ Let $|x-\pi|<\epsilon$ then if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ $$|f(x)-f(\pi)|=|f(x)-f(\pi)|=|0|<\epsilon$$ if $x \notin \mathbb{Q}$ then $$|f(x)-f(\pi)|=|sin(x)-0|<\epsilon$$ I am not sure about the last part of the proof i.e the verification part, is this correct any feedback would be much appreciated.","['functions', 'continuity', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

817184,"Is the set {a,b} uniquely defined?","First answer to this question would be yes , but consider the following question: How many elements has the set $\{a,\, b\}$? The answer to this question depends on $a$ and $b$: If $a=b$, then $\{a,\, b\}$ is a singleton. If $a\neq b$, then $\{a,\, b\}$ has two elements. So is $\{a,\, b\}$ uniquely defined although its cardinality is not unique? I have two possible answers solving this problem: Solution 1: Because of the axiom of extensionality a set is uniquely defined, iff one can say for each object whether it is element of the set or not. So $\{a,\, b\}$ is uniquely defined because one can say that an object $x$ is element of $\{a,\, b\}$, iff $x=a$ or $x=b$. The uniqueness of a set does not imply the uniqueness of its cardinality. Solution 2: If $a$ and $b$ are in the context defined objects (which do not depend on free variables), then $\{a,\, b\}$ as well as its cardinality is uniquely defined. If $a$ and $b$ are free variables or depend on free variables, then asking for the cardinality of $\{a,\, b\}$ is the same as asking for the truth of a statement form $A(x)$ with a free variable $x$: It doesn't make sense. Just after substituting all free variables with uniquely defined objects, on can ask for the cardinality of $\{a,\, b\}$. Which of my solutions is right or is there a better solution?

817297,Connection between separable measure spaces and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces,"I recently came across a theorem which makes a hypothesis that a certain measure space is separable (the definition can be found here ). In order to avoid confusion, I'll add the definition here: We have a space $X$ with measure. Then we define a distance on measurable sets $A$ and $B$ as $d(A,B)=meas(A\triangle B) = meas ((A\setminus B)\cup(B\setminus A))$ . The space is called separable measure space iff the space of measurable subsets is separable with respect to distance $d$ . In other words, there exists a countable sequence $S$ of measurable subsets of $X$ , such that for all measurable $A\subset X$ and $\forall \delta>0$ there exists $B\in S$ such that $meas(A\triangle B)<\delta $ . On the other hand, it's established that in non- $\sigma$ -finite spaces some weird things can happen (Fubini's theorem no longer valid, etc. This wiki article briefly touches this subject). Therefore, I'd like to have $\sigma$ -finiteness. We know that $L^p$ spaces for finite $p$ over separable measure spaces are separable; on the other hand, we can build a nonseparable $L^2$ space over a $\sigma$ -finite measure space ( see this answer ), therefore $\sigma$ -finiteness does not imply separability (in the sense of measures). My intuition suggests that separability of the measure space implies $\sigma$ -finiteness, however, I'm not able to prove or disprove it (this doesn't immediately follow from the definition). I'd be grateful if you could provide me with references where such things are discussed. And hints on how to prove/disprove the hypothesis above are welcome, too. Edit One can establish that a semifinite separable measure is $\sigma$ -finite, as was indicated in now deleted answer by Norbert . Moreover, the accepted answer by Michael Greinecker shows that a non-semifinite separable measure space can be non- $\sigma$ -finite.","['general-topology', 'reference-request', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

So assume true for $n=k$ thus $H=\lbrace g^i:0\leq i<k \rbrace$ and $H\cup \lbrace g^{k}\rbrace=\lbrace g^i:0\leq i<k \rbrace \cup \lbrace g^{k}\rbrace=\lbrace g^i:0\leq i<k+1 \rbrace$ so since it is true for $n=k+1$ we have that it is true for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$.

817555,Question about Hatcher's book CW complex,"I am currently reading in Hatcher's book at page 522 about the construction of open sets in a CW complex. They start with an arbitrary set $A \subset X$ and want to construct an open neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(A)$ . You might also look at page 4 in this reference top of page 4 The construction is inductive over the skeleta $X^n$ . Hence, he constructs a sequence of $N_{\varepsilon}^n(A)$ sets, where $N_{\varepsilon}^n(A)$ is an open neighbourhood of $A \cap X^n$ . He starts by saying: Take $N_{\varepsilon}^0 = A \cap X^0$ . I don't see why this should be open. This is an arbitrary set of discrete points, why should this be open? I also don't see why this induction works: I mean, there does not need to be an intersection between $A$ and a particular $n+1$ cell, so how do you construct this open $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ neighborhood. The only possible explanation to me is: If the intersection is trivial, then you are allowed to take any epsilon ball and otherwise you take an open covering of $A$ where each ball has a distance less than $\epsilon_{\alpha}$ away from $A$ , correct?

817558,Identities of Hecke operators,"While studying, I recently came across the following interesting problem. Let's say that the (level one) weight $k$ modular forms $M_k(\Gamma(1))$ have dimension $d$. We know by the ring structure of $M_*(\Gamma(1))$ that the map $M_k(\Gamma(1)) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^d$, sending a form to its first $d$ Fourier coefficients, is an isomorphism. This suggests a natural basis for $M_k(\Gamma(1))$: the pre-images of the standard basis vectors $(e_1, \ldots, e_n)$ for $\mathbb{C}^d$. Let's call this basis $g_1, \ldots, g_d$. The claim is that if $T_n$ is the $n$th Hecke operator, then $$T_n = \sum_{j=1}^{d-1} a_n(g_j) T_j$$ acting on $S_k(\Gamma(1))$. How can you prove this identity? I had thought to approach this by using the formula for the Fourier coefficients of the Hecke operators. We know that it suffices to check that both sides agree on the basis vectors $g_k$, which we can check by comparing the first $d$ Fourier coefficients. In principle, we can write down a formula for $b_i(T_n g_k)$ and $\sum_{j=1}^{d-1} a_n(g_j) b_i(T_j(g_k))$, but I tried doing this and it seemed really messy.

817597,proof of special trig limits,"I'm trying to prove a special trig limit, which is... $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1 - \cos{x}}{x}=0$$ So far, this is what I have (and I'll explain where I'm confused)
Using the squeeze theorem,
$h(x) \leq f(x) \leq g(x)$
$$-x^2 + 1 \leq \cos{x} \leq 1 $$
$$-x^2 + 1 - 1 \leq \cos x - 1 \leq 1 - 1$$
$$-x^2 \leq \cos{x} - 1 \leq 0$$
$$0 \leq 1 - \cos{x} \leq x^2 $$
$$0 \leq \frac{1- \cos{x}}{x} \leq x$$ Since limit of $0$ and $x$ equals zero (as $x$ approaches zero), so does $\displaystyle{\frac{1-\cos{x}}{x}}$. My first confusion, is when I try to graph the last line as separate functions
In quadrant $3$ and $4$, it holds up. However, in quadrant $1$ and $2$, it becomes 
$\displaystyle{x \leq \frac{1-\cos{x}}{x} \leq 0}$. I'm not sure if this is allowed in squeeze theorem, but I'm a tad bit confused. I have another guess as to why the end result is incorrect because $-x^2 + 1 \leq \cos{x} \leq 1$  are not the correct ""sandwich"" functions. $f(x) = \cos{x}$ touches $g(x) = 1$ in more than one spot. Every diagram of squeeze theorem I've seen, the sandwich functions only touch $f(x)$ at one spot. Is this a criteria I'm unaware of for picking $h(x)$ and $g(x)$? PS, I know I could have used $h(x) = -x^2 + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 1$, but I'd still like to know what I did wrong up top, please. Thanks for any helps, guys/gals/automatons","['calculus', 'limits']"
817614,Complement of a countable open cover of the rationals,"Suppose you take an open interval I of length 1, divide it into countable sub-intervals (I/2, I/4, etc.), and cover each rational with one of the sub-intervals. Since all the rationals are covered, then it seems that sub-intervals (if they don't overlap)   are separated by at most a single irrational. For instance, if s = sqrt(2) then we might have the two sub-intervals ( s-I/2, s ) and ( s, s+I/4 ) and s would be uncovered. But if we have a countable number of open sub-intervals with at most one (irrational) number between each sub-interval, that would mean we've covered all of the real line except for the complement, a countable number of irrationals, with an interval of length 1, which is absurd.

My understanding of a vector space is that, simplistically, it defines a coordinate plane that you can plot points on and figure out some useful things about the relationship between vectors/points. I think what I'm curious about is more application of some of these ideas. Such as, is a subspace useful for a reason other than you don't have to look at the entire space something exists in (I guess one way I've been thinking about it is if you want to make a map of a city, you don't necessarily need to make a map of the state it's in) or am I even wrong about that much? Also, even though I feel like I should know this at this point, is if the subspace is linearly independent, is it still a subspace? If it is, what exactly does that describe and/or why is that still useful? If it's not, is it still useful for something? I think the most difficult part of this for me is I'm having a hard time being able to visualize what exactly we're talking about and I have a hard time thinking that abstractly. I know one or two examples of this might be too specific and doesn't generalize the concept enough, but I think if I have some example to relate back to when applying the idea to new things it might be helpful.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

817974,How to solve this system of inhomogeneous differential equations,"In some past exam papers for the Maths course that I attend,I found this example and I would really appreciate if someone looked at my solution. It goes like this: Find general solution to 
$$
y_1' = 2 y_1 - y_2 + (x+1) e^{3x}, \\
y_2' = y_1 + 4 y_2 + 2 x e^{3x}.
$$ First of all, I set up the fundamental matrix and found its eigenvalues. I got that the matrix has repeated roots namely $r=3$. As I could not find two linearly independent eigenvectors (I had just one), I used this method I had found online to obtain another eigenvector given just one (not convinced that the method is $100 \%$ legitimate though). My eigenvectors are thus $v_1 = (1,-1)$ and $v_2 = (0,-1)$. Therefore my homogeneous solution matrix is 
$$
y  = c_1 e^{3x} v_1 + c_2 (x e^{3x} v_1 + e^{3x} v_2).
$$ Then, I searched for the inverse of this matrix and got
$$
\left(
\array{(1+x) e^{-3x} &x e^{-3x} \\
-e^{-3x} &-e^{-3x}}
\right)
$$
Multiplying this matrix with the inhomogeneous matrix $( (x+1) e^{3x} , 2 x e^{3x})$ I obtained $(3 x^2x+1, -3x-1)$, which upon integrating, I got $(x^3 +x^2+x, -\frac{3}{2} x-x)$.

 $$  (1+\Delta)^{-1} f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} K(x,y)~ dy$$

So we take the answer as $ 2 $. But the official answer key says that the answer is $ 0 $. The reason given (not in the official key - they simple contain the answer.

But this isn't enough, because consider the subset $\left\{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$. This has empty interior but is not complete because it doesn't contain $0$. In other words, a complete subspace of $\mathbb{Q}$ must be closed (which I think is true about metric spaces in general). So a complete subspace of $\mathbb{Q}$ must be closed and have empty interior, but are these two sufficient to imply completeness? If so, how do I prove this, and if not, what am I missing? I'm not necessarily looking for a complete answer, just some pointers in the right direction.","['complete-spaces', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
818462,What functions have the property that $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = c \cdot f(x+1)$?,"If we are allowed to pick any real-valued constant $c$ that helps, when does $$\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = c \cdot f(x+1)$$ In other words, when does the derivative of a function $f(x)$ equal some constant times $f(x)$? EXAMPLE If we set $f(x) = \sin{ (\frac{\pi}{2}x) }$, then $$\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sin (\frac{\pi}{2}x)  \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\sin (\frac{\pi}{2}(x+1)) $$ This also works for $f(x) = \cos (\frac{\pi}{2}x) $: $$\frac{d}{dx} \left( \cos (\frac{\pi}{2}x)  \right) =\frac{\pi}{2} \cos (\frac{\pi}{2}(x+1)) $$ WHAT I'M AFTER Is there some way of finding formulas that possess this property? Perhaps there is a way to formalize a method.  I'd like to know if there's an easy way to find formulas that work.","['transformation', 'intuition', 'derivatives']"
818473,"Show that there is no function $\phi\in C^2(\mathbb R^3,\mathbb R)$ such that $\nabla \phi=(-y,x,0)^t$","I want to show that there exists no function $\phi\in C^2(\mathbb R^3,\mathbb R)$ such that $\nabla \phi=(-y,x,0)^t$. I did it this way: I know $\nabla \phi=(\phi_x,\phi_y,\phi_z)^t$. Integrating each component: $\int -y dx=-yx+c_1$ and $\int x dy=xy+c_2$ and $\int 0dz=c_3$ with constants $c_i$. So we get $-yx+c_1=xy+c_2 \Leftrightarrow 2xy=c_1-c_2$ which is a contradiction. Now my tutor said this is wrong because I didn't used the fact $\phi\in C^2(\mathbb R^3,\mathbb R)$ but he couldn't explain me why my calculation is wrong. So is he right or can you do it like this? What's the problem about integrating each component? I will be happy about any hints or comments. Edit: I am not interested in a solution. It's easy to see the rotations of the left and right side aren't equal and it follows the statement above.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
818475,Simple algebra formula for which I can't find the right answer,"I have the formula $y + (z + 1) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (z + 1) \cdot (z + 2)$, and I should work to $y = \frac{1}{2}\cdot z \cdot (z + 1)$.

I do not know how to approach it because of all the square root functions. It seems if $x=\pm i\alpha \ $   we may have some convergence problems because of the denominator.  Perhaps there are ways to solve this using complex methods involving the branch cut from the square root singularity.   I just do not know what to choose $f(z)$ for a suitable complex function to represent the integrand. I also tried differentiating under the integral signs w.r.t $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ but it did not simplify anything.  Thanks.   How can we calculate this integral?","['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"
818501,Factoring Trigonometric Equations,"And so begins another day in my quest to pass Calculus I. I have a question about factoring trigonometric expressions. I'm sorry I can't be more accurate than that, but I'm not sure of the names of the operations I need to perform. I have a problem: $$ -2(cos(x) – cos(2x)) = 0 $$ I divide both sides by -2: $$cos(x) – cos(2x) = 0$$ And then transform the left hand side into a polynomial using the double angle formula: $$1 + cos(x) – 2cos^2(x) = 0$$ However this is where I get stuck. According to Wolfram Alpha I am now supposed to factor the expression to get $-((cos(x) – 1)(1 + 2cos(x))) = 0$ Maybe I am missing something but I don't understand how to factor for that step. Could somebody explain it or link me to the names of the concepts I need to Google? Thanks.","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
818524,Correlation with many zero values,"I have data for selling books from 2 bookstores for 100 days. For the first 90 days, no book was sold.

The correlation for the last 10 days is negative and -1. However, if I take all the 100 days, Pearson correlation is  0.486413 and Spearman is 0.9351082. My question now, should the zeros be included in the correlation (100 days), or should I just compare the days that books were sold (last 10 days)?","['statistics', 'correlation']"
818542,Moments at which moving points on a circle coincide,"Points A $(0,1)$ and B $(1,0)$ start moving along the circumference of a unit circle with center $(0,0)$ in the same, positive (that is, counterclockwise) direction. Every minute, points A and B traverse arcs respectively of $60$° and $42$°. Visually: Determine moments $t_1, \ldots, t_k,\ldots,$ such that at time $t_k$ points A and B coincide for the $k^\text{th}$ time. I've been able to determine $t_1$, but cant seem to determine the next moment. I'll describe how I've gotten $t_1$ and hopefully you can suggest how to proceed (or if I'm doing it wrong, how to go about solving for all $t$). We're given the angular velocities of the two points: $v_A = 60$° ($\pi\over 3$) per minute; $v_B = 42$° ($7\pi\over 30$) per minute. We also know the starting angles of the two points (shown also on the graph): $d_A = {\pi \over 2}$ and $d_B = 0$. To calculate $t_1$, we just have to solve the following equation for $t$: $$\left({\pi\over 2} + {\pi \over 3}\cdot t \right)= \left(0 + {7\pi\over 30}\cdot t\right) \tag{$T_1$}.$$ Calculation yields the value of $5$ for $t$, so $\color{brown}{t_1 = 5}$ minutes. Now, another basic calculation tells us that at minute $t_1$, points A and B form an angle of $5\pi\over 3$ with respect to $OB$ (sorry, forgot to label 'O' on the graph). So, I figured that to calculate moment $t_2$, it will suffice to solve the following equation for $t$ and add $t_1$ to it: $$\left({5\pi\over 3} + {\pi \over 3}\cdot t \right)= \left({5\pi\over 3} + {7\pi\over 30}\cdot t\right) \tag{$T_2^?$}.$$ But, of course, the first summands are canceled out, leaving us with: $$\left({\pi \over 3}\cdot t \right)= \left({7\pi\over 30}\cdot t\right) \tag{$T_2^?$}.$$ This solution is true only for $t=0$, so clearly something went wrong with my reasoning. (Of course, $t=0 + t_1 = t_1$, which is a moment of coincidence, but it's not the moment we're looking for). I would appreciate any help with the strategy I've taken or the way I should approach it instead.","['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'physics', 'analytic-geometry', 'trigonometry']"
