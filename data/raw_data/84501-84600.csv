1108447,Proving sine of sum identity for all angles,"Could anyone present a proof of sine of sum identity for any pair of angles $a$, $b$? $$\sin(a+b) = \sin(a) \cos(b) + \cos(a) \sin(b)$$ Most proofs are based on geometric approach (angles are $<90$ in this case). But please note the formula is supposed to work for any pair of angles. The other derivation I know is using Euler's formula, namely this one. There's one thing I don't feel comfortable with - we know that we add angles when multiplying two complex numbers. This is proven with sine of sum identity. So first we prove how multiplication of two complex exponentials works using sine of sum identity, and then use multiplication of complex exponentials to prove sine of sum identity. Can you tell me how it's not a circular argument?",['trigonometry']

1108464,Measure Theory - Problem with definition about simple functions,"I did this question lately and then realized what my mistake was. I got a good help!
But looks like only now I understand what was the real problem, to begin with. And this brought me to the same questioning. In the same (same used in the previous question) book of Measure theory and Integration of Folland, we have the following definition. The definition of integration is made only for simple function with standard representation, and this is with a good reason, the text above says why. Therefore, to the purposes of integration, it is sufficient to consider only simple functions with standard representation in the definition of integral in $L^+$ ? With this in mind, why couldn't we just consider $$\int f = \sup\Big\{ \int \Phi: \ 0\leq\Phi\leq f, \Phi \textrm{ is a simple and in standard representation}  \Big\}$$ instead $$\int f = \sup\Big\{ \int \Phi: \ 0\leq\Phi\leq f, \Phi \textrm{ is a simple}  \Big\}?$$ The last one is the ""official"" definition. If we accept this, the answers I was given are wrong. So, I want (and need, this is too fundamental to just let alone) to know what is wrong with my reasoning.

1108485,Combinatorial Proof For Counting All Binary Strings,"The Question Provide a combinatorial proof for the following: For $n \ge 1$, $$2^n = \binom{n+1}1+\binom{n+1}3+\ldots+\begin{cases}

\binom{n+1}{n+1},&\text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}$$ My Work Parts a,b of the question involved counting strings. This lead me to notice that $2^n$ is actually all $n$-bit binary strings. Which means the series on the right is somehow counting all total binary strings of length $n$. I'm kind of stumped as to how the series works though. I tried writing out some examples of it. $2^1 = \binom{1+1}{1} = \binom{2}{1} = 2$ $2^2 = \binom{3}{1}+\binom{3}{3} = 4$ $2^3 = \binom{4}{1}+\binom{4}{3} = 8$ $2^4 = \binom{6}{1}+\binom{6}{3}$ This is where I realized I must be doing it wrong because $2^4 = 16$ and $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ My Question I'm trying to understand the problem. How does the series work? How would I write out $2^5$ as the $RHS$ series for example? And then how does it count the total amount of $n$ length binary strings.","['combinatorial-proofs', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

1108639,Coefficients of spherical solution to Laplace's equation with difficult Robin boundary conditions,"I'm trying to solve Laplace's equation in an (axisymmetric) external spherical domain.  The controlling equation is: $$\nabla^2 f = 0$$ $f$ must dissappear at infinity, and at the surface of the sphere ($r=1$) we have: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial r} = \sigma h(f+1)$$ Here $\sigma$ is a positive parameter, and $h$ is an angular ""step"" function: $$h=\begin{cases} 1 & \mu \leq \tau \\ 0 & \mu \gt \tau  \end{cases}$$ Here $\mu$ is simply a transformed angular coordinate ($\mu = \cos{\theta}$) and $\tau$ is a parameter.  The most important case is $\tau = 0$, but it can take any value from $-1$ to $1$. The solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordiantes for this situation is: $$ f(r,\mu) = \sum_0^\infty A_nr^{-(n+1)}P_n({\mu})$$ Here $P_n$ are the Legendre Polynomials and  the $A_n$ are the coefficients that define the solution. Inserting this into the boundary condition at the surface ($r=1$) we get: $$ \sum_0^\infty -(n+1)A_nP_n(\mu)= \sigma h\left(1 + \sum_0^\infty A_nP_n(\mu)\right) $$ The next step here is to multiply by a generic Legendre Polynomial (here $P_m$), and to integrate from $-1$ to $1$, to take advantage of orthogonality. Unfortunately, the factor $h$ ruins orthogonality on the RHS, so we end up with: $$
\frac{-2(m+1)}{2m+1}A_m = \sigma \left[ \int_{-1}^\tau P_m \, d\mu +\sum_{n=0}^\infty A_n\left( \int_{-1}^\tau P_m(\mu) P_n(\mu) \, d\mu \right)\right]
$$ So we end up with an infinite linear system of equations for the $A_n$ (note than in the above the $A_n$ are the same as the $A_m$, just different counters). For now what I've been doing is truncating the series (which basically forces all $A_n$ above a certain $n$ to be $0$) and solving the now finite system computationally.  However, choosing a maximum $n$ has been somewhat arbitrary, and for non-small values of $\sigma$ this procedure seems to converge incorrectly. Is there a smart to way to solve this system?  It's be best to have procedures that work for all $\sigma$ and $\tau$, but I'd be satisfied with a procedure that handles $\tau = 0$ and\or limiting cases of $\sigma$ ($\sigma \to \infty$ or $\sigma \to 0$).","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

$S(\infty) = \frac{T}{2}$, $S(0) = \frac{T}{-2}$, $S(-(-2)/2) = \infty$ This is currently how I visualize the conditions: So z = $\infty$ is mapped to T/2 on the real line of the laplace domain z = 0 is mapped to -T/2 on the real line z = 1 is mapped to infinity But this drawing (straight from my interpretation of these conditions) is not making any sense to me!

1108679,"Complete ""Macroscopic"" Measure","Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a measure space and let $(X,\overline{\mathcal{M}},\overline{\mu})$ be it's completion. The definition of a complete measure can be interpreted as a complete ""microscopic"" measure, in the sense it can measure any subset of any null set in $\mathcal{M}$, which are the microscopic sets of $\mathcal{M}$. This has a intuitive appeal, makes all sense that this subsets has null measure, even if we can't measure them we would still think they ""must"" have null measure. Following this idea, we can also think in a complete ""macroscopic"" measure, in the sense that any set containing a set in $\mathcal{M}$ with infinite measure is measurable and also have infinite measure. In other words, if $E\in\mathcal{M}$ and $\mu(E) =\infty$, then any $F\supset E$ is $\overline{\mathcal{M}}-$measurable, with $\overline{\mu}(F) = \infty$.

$$ \mathbf{P}[X \leq x] = \int_0^x \theta e^{-\theta t} \, dt \quad \text{ for } x \geq 0\, .$$ We just have to evaluate the integral:

Is this true? If so, is the derivation straightforward given the standard normal tail bound? It doesn't seem trivial, though often these things are simple modifications of the $N(0,I)$ case. I believe one can reduce the problem to proving

1108727,Techniques for proving asymptotic normality by Taylor expansion?,"Suppose I have a sequence of densities $$
f_{X_n}(x) = \exp[\ell_n(x)], \qquad (x \in A).
$$ My goal is to prove a statement like $\sqrt n (X_n - \mu) \to N(0, \sigma^2)$ in distribution, for an appropriate $\sigma^2$ and some choice of $\mu$. We often teach undergraduates to do this using moment generating functions or characteristic functions, or by direct manipulation of the cdf. By contrast, I would like to do this by expanding $f_{X_n}(x)$ about the mode $\hat x_n$ (suppose $f_{X_n}(x)$ is unimodal with $\ell''_n(x) < 0)$. Then we expand $T_n = \sqrt n (X_n - \hat x_n)$ $$
f_{T_n}(t) \approx n^{-1/2}f_{X_n}(\hat x_n) \exp \left\{\frac 1 {2n} t^2 \ell''_n(\hat x_n)\right\}.
$$ Under the condition that $\hat x_n = \mu + o(n^{-1/2})$ and $\ell''_n(\mu) / n \to -I(\mu)$ for some function $I(\mu)$, one then might guess $$
T_n \stackrel{\cdot}{\sim} N(0, I(\mu)^{-1}).
$$ Now for the question: I'm essentially looking for conditions which allow me to make this result rigorous. The heuristic seems very similar to what one does when trying to prove asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators, and so I would hope for some conditions in terms of $\ell''_n(x)$ and $I(x)$, or perhaps a third derivative $\ell'''_n(x)$. The best I can do at the moment is try to expand things out 
$$
f_{T_n}(t) = n^{-1/2} \exp\left[\ell_n (\hat x_n) + \underbrace{t / \sqrt n \ell_n(\hat x_n)}_{=0} + \frac{t^2}{2n}\ell''_n(\hat x_n + n^{-1/2} t^\star)\right]
$$
with remainder $\frac 1 {2n} t^2 \ell''(\hat x_n + n^{-1/2} t^\star)$, which works for showing that the unnormalized density converges to a Gaussian density. But this doesn't finish the job because I still have to show that the normalizing constant converges to the right answer if I want to finish off the proof with Scheffe's theorem. I could try to finish it by applying dominated convergence to the exponential term, but this hasn't worked so far for the problem I'm interested in, and doesn't feel like a sensible thing to do anyways.","['statistics', 'probability', 'statistical-inference', 'probability-theory']"

Now, $S^1$ is compact and connected so $\theta(S^1)$ is a closed interval $[a,b]$. But removing a point from $[a,b]$ gives two connected components, while removing a point from $S^1$ still gives a connected space. Hence, $[a,b]\not\cong S^1$, so $\theta$ doesn't exist.

1109143,Weak topologies and weak convergence - Looking for feedbacks,"I am currently trying to get exactly what the weak and the weak* topologies are, in particular in connection to the concept of weak convergence in measure, however I am not completely sure on what I have got so far. So here, there is a summary of what I understood. I disseminated the text with some numbered questions, to point out what I am not sure about this summary. Any feedback will be most welcome! Edit: The answers I received have been quite useful and stimulating (e.g. I ended up looking at the Kelley-Namioka text), but I would love to get something more specific. Hence, I am adding a bounty. Thus, I slightly changed the text, because I actually changed my ""opinion"" regarding some issues. Edit 2: I know that editing put a question again on the top, however I did not edit with this purpose. I actually noticed that I did not get any new answer, and, considering I actually changed my view on some issues (I am studying the topic intensively these days), I changed the text improving (IMO) the content, without affecting any new answer. Moreover, I add some straightforward questions that arose out of these hours of study, in order to make clear what I am looking for, and I put the rest of the text as block, for those who want to see what I ended up with. Questions: 1. Isn’t it problematic to use the inner product notation when we deal with dual pairs and weak topologices, considering that we work in this case mainly with Banach spaces, and not all norm norms are associated to an inner product? 2. Does it ever enter in the discussion on weak topologies the concept of algebraic dual ? 3. If by definition $X^*$ is the topological dual of $X$, hence it is the set of all continuous functionals on $X$, isn’t by definition that each $x^* \in X^*$ is actually continuous? Why do we need the weak topology on $X$? [The same problem does not really apply to the weak* topology on $X^*$ that makes each evaluation functional $e_x: X \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous, because those evaluation functionals are not continuous by definition .] 4. I see in which way the fact that the bidual $X^{**}$ can be way bigger than $X$ when we deal with weak topologies can be relevant, namely if $X = X^{**}$ then weak and weak* topologies coincide. However, I don’t see how can be that $X \subset X^{**}$. 5. Related to the previous problem is the fact that when we move from dual pairs and weak topologies to weak convergence in measure, I don’t see why the weak convergence in measure coincides with endowing the reference metric space $(X,d)$ with the weak* topology, and not simply the weak topology. Thus the question should be, how do we decide what is the main space, what is the dual one, and which one is the one endowed with a topology, in order to come up with the concept of weak convergence? Is it through the Riesz Representation theorem ? (...and now I should end up looking exactly what that representation thoerem does...) 6. I read that what is called weak convergence should be called weak* convergence, because it is based on the weak* topology. Why, actually? [True, this question can be considered a repetition of the previous] In the following, there are my thoughts on weak topologies and weak convergence. I hope they are correct or interesting. I put them as a spoiler in order not to scare who would like to answer. In general we have the following definition of initial (or weak ) topology : given a set $X \neq \varnothing$, a family of topological spaces $\{ (Y_i, \tau_i ) \}_{i \in I}$, and for every $i \in I$ a function $f_i : X \to Y_i$, the initial (or weak ) topology is the weakest topology on $X$ that makes all the functions $f_i$ continuous. Notice that, if $\mathcal{F} := \{ f | f: X \to \mathbb{R} \}$, then $X$ can be seen as set of real valued functions on $\mathcal{F}$, where each $x \in X$ is an evaluation functional $e_x : X^* \to \mathbb{R}$ with $e_x (f) = f(x)$. Thus, the weak topology on $\mathcal{F}$, denoted by $\sigma (\mathcal{F}, X)$, is identical to the relative topology on $\mathcal{F}$ as subset of $\mathbb{R}^X$ endowed with the product topology. Now, let $X$ a linear space with $x \in X$. Thus, let $X’$ be the algebraic dual of $X$, i.e. the vector space of all linear functionals on $X$, and let $X^*$ be the topological dual of $X$, i.e. $X^* := \{ x^* | x^*: X \to \mathbb{R}, x^* \text{ continuous} \}$ is, or – in plain english – the vector space of all continuous linear functionals on $X$, with $x^* \in X^*$. Notice that, for the following, for example Rudin points out that $\langle x , x^* \rangle \equiv x^*(x)$, thus we should have that $\langle x^* , x \rangle \equiv e_x (x^*)$. [a. Right?] Thus, $X$ can be seen as a vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{X^*}$, in which case $\sigma (X, X^*)$ is the weak topology on $X$ (denoted by $w$), defined as
  $$ x_\alpha \overset{w}{\to} x \in X \Longleftrightarrow \forall x^* \in X^* , \langle x_a, x^* \rangle \to \langle x , x^* \rangle. $$ In the same vein, $X^*$ can be seen as a vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}^X$, in which case $\sigma (X^*, X)$ is the weak* topology on $X^*$ (denoted by $w^*$), defined as
  $$ x^{*}_\alpha \overset{w^*}{\to} x^* \in X \Longleftrightarrow \forall x \in X , \langle x^{*}_a, x \rangle \to \langle x^* , x \rangle. $$ Notice that in both cases we are just declining in different ways the original definition of initial topology given at the beginning. What we are changing is simply the ""reference"" space that makes all functions continuous.  Indeed, in the case of the weak topology , we have that $(X, \sigma(X, X^*)$ is the topological space that makes all the $x^* \in X^*$ continuous. In the case of the weak* topology, we have that $(X^*, \sigma(X^*, X)$ is the topological space that makes all the evaluation functionals $e_x$ from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ continuous. I know (after quite some bookreading) that what can be found in the following text as the old point of view is the correct way of looking at the problem, however I keep on feel that it is the new point of view the correct way. In particular, I find what I wrote in the old point of view misleading. Indeed, I implicitly state that we have as dual pair $\langle X, C(X) \rangle$ and every $\mu$ is on $X$, but this does not make sense. Indeed, we should have that the dual pair is $\langle \Delta (X), C(X) \rangle$ and every $\mu$ is on $\Delta (X)$. But then, if the dual pair is really $\langle \Delta (X), C(X) \rangle$, according to the definition of weak and weak* topology I wrote down, here we are actually dealing with the weak topology! Hence, the dual pair should be $\langle C(X), \Delta(X) \rangle$, but why? Old point of view: Thus, if we take all these definitions and we use them to get what the weak convergence in measures is, we actually have that weak convergence in measure is the same as convergence in the weak* topology. [b. Right?] Indeed, given a metric space $(X,d)$ a sequence of measures $(\mu_n)$ converges weakly to $\mu$  in $X$ if and only if for every $\phi \in C(X)$ (where $C(X)$ is the space of all continuous functions on $X$),
  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X \phi d\mu_n = \int_X \phi d\mu, $$ 
  and here the $\mu_n$ should make the same job of our $x^{*}_n$ in our definition of the weak* topology. [c. Right?] . New point of view: Thus, if we take all these definitions and we use them to get what the weak convergence in measures is, we actually have that weak convergence in measure is the same as convergence in the weak topology. [d. Right?] Indeed, given a metric space $(X,d)$ a sequence of measures $(\mu_n)$ converges weakly to $\mu$  in $\Delta (X)$, where $\Delta (X)$ denotes the set of all probability measures on $X$, if and only if for every $\phi \in C(X)$ (where $C(X)$ is the space of all continuous functions on $X$),
  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X \phi d\mu_n = \int_X \phi d\mu. $$
  Thus, in this setting the dual pair of spaces is $\langle \Delta (X) , C (X) \rangle$ and indeed the definition of weak convergence in $\Delta (X)$ ends up to be equivalent to endow $\Delta (X)$ with the weak topology (and not the weak* topology!).

Improve this question I am currently an undergraduate, but I am considering applying for a phd in algebraic geometry or a related field. I am quite interested in the link between non-commutative geometry and theoretical physics (string theory/QFT). Speaking to a few of my geometry lecturers and tutors I got the impression, at least from some, that non-commutative geometry and/or it's applications to string theory have died down as areas of research, or that it isn't as ""fashionable"" as it used to be.

Is it true that $SO^+(1,3) \cong SU(2) \times SU(2)$? If not, is $SO^+(1,3)$ isomorphic to some quotient of $SU(2) \times SU(2)$? Is the analogous result true for their Lie alebras, i.e. $\mathfrak{so}^+(1,3) \cong \mathfrak{su}(2) \oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)$, or something similar?

1109410,Need function for tunable sigmoid 2D surface,"This question is similar to one that I asked 6 months ago, but I added some additional requirements and I'll try to ask it more concisely. Requirements: I need a $2D$ surface, $z = f(x, y)$ where the domain of $x$ is $[0,1]$ and domain of $y$ is $[0,1]$.  I don't care how the function behaves outside the domain. $f(0, 0) = 0$. $f(1, y) = 1, f(x, 1) = 1$ Surface should be monotonic.  Meaning that $f(x + \delta, y) \geq f(x, y)$ and $f(x, y + \delta) \geq f(x, y)$.  The ""equal to"" part is to handle the case where $x$ or $y = 1$.  In that case, the function should be 1 per condition 3. Should be some way to adjust the shape of the surface or bias it.  For example, here is an example of a tunable sigmoid function, $f(x)$: I can modify the parameters $g$ and $k$ to change the shape inflection point of the sigmoid.  I'd like the ability to ""tune"" the surface like that using hopefully only 3-6 parameters. **Edit: Function does not need to be exactly 0 at $f(0,0)$ or exactly 1 at $f(1,y)$ or $f(x,1)$, but should be close.","['surfaces', 'functions']"

1109457,Why don't we use Presburger's arithmetic instead of Peano's arithmetic?,"I was reading about quantifier elimination and discovered the Presburger Arithmetic , the article mentions two points about it: It is decidable, complete and consistent. It omits multiplication entirely. It is weaker than Peano's arithmetic. Whenever I hear about Peano's arithmetic, I also heard about it's undecidability/completeness/consistency. So, since it is complete, decidable and consistent why don't we use Presburger arithmetic instead? I know that it may has something to do with it's weakness, but it's not very clear what is the meaning of this weakness, presumably one can prove less things with it perhaps? My other doubt about Presburger arithmetic is why is it a problem of it having no multiplication? I always see multiplication being defined after the operation of sum: The multiplication is just a given number of sums, can't we just make the multiplication and use it anyway or the multiplication causes problems? Also, from the first theorem of incompleteness: ""Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete."" Doesn't Presburger arithmetic have an elementary arithmetic?

Force is a function of all the coordinates necessary to describe the (rigid) body, and should cover all the degrees of freedom in the system. However, it seems to me that since $\dot{\mathbf q}=\frac{d\mathbf q}{dt}$, it's only necessary to specify $F(\mathbf q,t)$ for a complete description. I'm not sure I understand why this isn't the case, but my best guess is as follows. If $\mathbf q,\dot{\mathbf q}$ are given in a differential equation, such as $\dot{\mathbf q}=t^\mathbf q\mathbf q^\dot{\mathbf q}$, then it's necessary to specify all of $\mathbf q,\dot{\mathbf q},t$ in order to locate its position and velocity at any given time, unless the differential equation has a solution and we use it. But this explanation is strange to me. Since we can have a $k$th-order differential equation which specifies $\mathbf q,\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf q,\ldots,\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\mathbf q$ with no obvious solution, wouldn't that mean our equation of motion is actually $F(\mathbf q,\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf q,\ldots,\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\mathbf q,t)=m\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\mathbf q$? Edit The differential equation above which has a vector exponentiated by a vector is just a poorly thought-out attempt at an example of a diff eq with no obvious solution to me, it doesn't really matter what it is.

either $X$ is noetherian, or $f$ is quasi-compact and separated. Both these assumptions lead to some finiteness of affine covers on $X$ where we can write $\mathcal{F}$ as $\widetilde{M}$. My question is: Why do we need these assumptions? In the proof, after reducing to $Y$ affine, the argument leads to the exact sequence \begin{equation}

My approach: Since each side of the table seats two people, there are $2$ possible arrangements for two people sitting on a side (for example, $AB$ and $BA$). Given $8$ people, there are $8!$ ways to arrange them, and to avoid over counting rotations, we have $\frac{8!}{8}$ ways to arrange $8$ people around the table. So we have a total possible arrangements of
$$2*\left(\frac{8!}{8}\right)=\frac{8!}{4}=10,080.$$ If two of the eight people, say $A$ and $B$, do not get along well, how many different seatings are possible with $A$ and $B$ not sitting next to each other? My approach: There are two cases to consider by which $A$ is next to $B$, the first case $AB$ and the second case $BA$ (but they don't have to be on the same side of the square when this happens). These two cases give us $2*6!$ possible arrangements. Is my approach to these problems correct? My approach to the second one feels incomplete, or even incorrect. As there must be a two step process, as I must find the number of arrangements by which the condition is met and also avoid over counting the rotations.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

For every pair of players who throw the same number, the group scores 1 point. Find the mean and variance of the total score of the group. Here is what I tried: Let $S_i$ denote the score obtained by the players who throw $i, i=1,2,\ldots,6$, and let $X_i$ be the number of people who throw $i$, and $1_{ij}$ be the indicator function which is 1 only if the $j^{th}$ person throws $i$. So, we have $X_i=\sum_{j=1}^n 1_{ij}$. I computed $E[S_i|X_i]=\frac{X_i(X_i-1)}{2}$ and so $E[S_i]=\frac{n^2-n}{72}$ and therefore $E[S]=\frac{n^2-n}{12}$, where $S=\sum_{i=1}^6 S_i$ is the total score. In the same manner, by using variance-covariance expansion and conditional variance, I tried to compute $\mathrm{var}(S)$, but at some point I got $\mathrm{var}(\sum_{j<k}1_{ij}1_{ik})$ and I can't compute this variance because of dependence of summands.
