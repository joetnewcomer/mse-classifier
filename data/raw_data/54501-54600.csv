583030,Convergence of $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \frac{2+(-1)^n}{n+1}$,"I have to show that the following series convergences: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \frac{2+(-1)^n}{n+1}$$ I have tried the following: The alternating series test cannot be applied, since $\frac{2+(-1)^n}{n+1}$ is not monotonically decreasing. I tried splitting up the series in to series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \frac{2}{n+1}$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$. I proofed the convergence of the first series using the alternating series test, but then i realized that the second series is divergent. I also tried using the ratio test: for even $n$ the sequence converges to $\frac{1}{3}$, but for odd $n$ the sequence converges to $3$. Therefore the ratio is also not successful. I ran out of ideas to show the convergence of the series. Thanks in advance for any help!","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"
583061,Horse Racing Odds in Statistics,"I have a math project to do in statistics and probability. I am given a table of data related to horse racing biding which contain Odds of a Favorite Winning, if the favorite won etc. So I have 300 races and the bookies odds of the favorite winning right, they are in form of: 4/1 9/4 7/4 11/4 9/4 So now I have the following question: 1) Calculate the average odds of favorite winning. 2) What is the probability of a favorite winning. I can't seem to understand how to calculate the 1st question. My approach was to add up the Odds like so: (in the given 5 samples) 4/1+ 9/4+ 7/4+ 11/4+ 9/4= ............ 40/17 which I divide both side by 5 (since there are 5 races in this sample), thus the average odds of the given samples is 8/3.4 (rounded up gives 8/3). Is that correct? I was told if you convert the odds to probability and then add up the mum of them and then divide by number of races you will get a skewed result. And correct me if I'm wrong but calculating the odds is for example -> given 11/4, the odds of happening are 11/(4+11) = 0.73 == 73% Now for the 2nd question what I simply did is I took the number of wins and divided that by number of races which is basically relative frequency approach.. P(E) = # of desired outcomes / # of repetitions of the experiment.. which in this case relates to P(E) = # of wins / # of races, isn't that correct?","['statistics', 'probability']"

We can multiply by $x^3$ and solve the quadratic to get $x^3$ but that would be unnecessarily complicated.Also, as $x^3$ has 2 solutions,I can't see how x can have only 1 value.

583066,What is the exact and precise definition of an ANGLE?,"On wikipedea I found a definition of an Angle as  such: ""In order to measure an angle θ, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of compasses. The length of the arc s is then divided by the radius of the arc r, and possibly multiplied by a scaling constant $k$ (which depends on the units of measurement that are chosen):
   $$\theta = k \frac{s}{r}.$$ 
  The value of θ thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio $s/r$ is unaltered.' And the definition of circular arc is given as: ""a circular arc is a segment of a circle, or of its circumference (boundary) if the circle is considered to be a disc."" Now since circular arc is a segment of a circle we are not supposed to have circular arc of length more than circumference of the circle. So we cannot define angles more than $2\pi$ in this manner. But I found a topic in the book, ""Unified algebra and trigonometry"" (Addison-Wesley mathematics series) art 3-5. I've posted it as an answer to the question https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/87057/angular-displacement/87066#87066 . There the author of the book explains that we can have circular arc more than the circumference of a circle as: ""....where the circular arc $\stackrel \frown {PP}^{′}$ denoted by $s$,.... since the number of revolutions of any angle is determined by the ratio of the intercepted circular arc length $s$ to circumference of the circle we define, magnitude of an angle in revolutions as Angle in revolutions$ = s/2πr$..."" means there can be angles of more than $2\pi$ . Question1 :Does the definition of an angle depends upon its use in physics? Question2 : if we assign a point on a solid body named $P$ having an initial angle $\theta$ after this solid body rotates a full circle can we assume the angle of point $P$ after the revolution to be again $\theta$ or $\theta +2\pi$. Please state a precise definition to support the validity of this argument. As I understands if we assign polar-coordinates to point $P$ these polar coordinates  will be $(\pm r,\theta\pm 2n\pi)$ and but if rotation is involved should we consider the angle used as "" oriented "" or "" non-oriented "".","['geometry', 'physics', 'definition', 'rotations', 'terminology']"

583082,How much topology for graph theory?,"I am writing a thesis in the context of descriptive complexity in theoretical computer science and therefore need to study a little bit of graph theory. My background is not mathematics but computer science with a strong interest in mathematics (which means I have not heard advanced lectures but feel comfortable learn more). The focus here is the theoretical background of planar graphs. My starting point is the planar graphs chapter in Diestel 2005 . A surface is a compact connected Hausdorf topological space $S$ in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the Euclidian plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. An arc, a circle and a disc in $S$ are subsets that are homeomorphic in the subspace topology to the real interval $[0,1]$, to the unit circle $S^1 = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid \|x\|=1\}$, and to the unit disc $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \|x\| \leq 1\}$, respectively. These definitions are later used to define planar graphs, plane graphs. Other concepts like topological isomorphisms are also used. I found all the definitions on Wikipedia and I know what they say . Unfortunately I have no intuition what they mean. For example, I guess an arc is a continuous curve which does not intersect with it. My question is not what the definitions mean but rather what is a good starting point to learn about topology from a computer science perspective (with little background knowledge) in the context of graph theory and how much is really needed? Is it possible to take these topology things as black boxes or is it important to understand?","['general-topology', 'graph-theory', 'reference-request', 'soft-question', 'intuition']"

But I assume if he stated it without proof Here is what I want to show: Let $E$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K.

The question asks Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . How many $\alpha \in S_n$ are there such that $\alpha^2 = 1$ ? I know that, if $\alpha^2 = 1$ , then either $\alpha = 1$ or $\alpha$ is the product of disjoint transpositions. If $\alpha = (i, j)$ is a single transposition, then there are $\frac{1}{2^1 \cdot 1!} \binom{n}{2}$ such $\alpha$ (the $2^1$ and $1!$ are put in the denominator to help in noticing the pattern later). If $\alpha = (i, j)(k, l)$ is the product of $2$ disjoint transpositions, then there are $\frac{1}{2^2 \cdot 2!} \binom{n}{2} \binom{n-2}{2}$ such $\alpha$ , where the $2^2$ appears in the denominator to account for the cyclic permutations of each transposition, and the $2!$ appears to account for the permutation of the transpositions themselves. If $\alpha$ is the product of $3$ disjoint transpositions, then there are $\frac{1}{2^3 \cdot 3!} \binom{n}{2} \binom{n-2}{2} \binom{n-4}{2}$ such $\alpha$ .

For each woman, there is a subset of the men, any one of which she would happily marry; and any man would be happy to marry a woman who wants to marry him. Consider whether it is possible to pair up (in marriage) the men and women so that every person is happy. If we let $A_i$ be the set of men that the i-th woman would be happy to marry, then the marriage theorem states that each woman can happily marry a man if and only if the collection of sets ${A_i}$ meets the marriage condition. The collection S satisfies the marriage condition (MC) if and only if for each subcollection $W \subseteq S$, we have

583707,Intuitive explanation for formula of maximum length of a pipe moving around a corner?,"For one of my homework problems, we had to try and find the maximum possible length $L$ of a pipe (indicated in red) such that it can be moved around a corner with corridor lengths $A$ and $B$ (assuming everything is 2d, not 3d): My professor walked us through how to derive a formula for the maximum possible length of the pipe, ultimately arriving at the equation $L = (A^{2/3} + B^{2/3})^{3/2}$. The issue I have is understanding intuitively why this formula works, and exactly what it's doing. I understand the steps taken to get to this point, but there's an odd symmetry to the end result -- for example, is the fact that $\frac{2}{3}$ and its inverse are the only constants used just a coincidence, or indicative of some deeper relationship? I also don't quite understand how the formula relates, geometrically, to the diagram. If I hadn't traced the steps myself, I would have never guessed that the formula was in any way related to the original problem. If possible, can somebody give an intuitive explanation as to why this formula works, and how to interpret it geometrically? Here's how he found the formula, if it's useful: The formula is found by finding the maximum possible length of the pipe by expressing the length in terms of the angle $\theta$ formed between the pipe and the wall, and by taking the derivative to find when $\frac{dL}{d\theta} = 0$, which is the minimum of $\frac{dL}{d\theta}$ and is therefore when $L$ is the smallest: $$
L = \min_{0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{A}{\cos{\theta}} + \frac{B}{\sin{\theta}} \\
0 = \frac{dL}{d\theta} = \frac{A\sin{\theta}}{\cos^2{\theta}} - \frac{B\cos{\theta}}{\sin^2{\theta}} \\
0 = \frac{A\sin^3{\theta} - B\cos^3{\theta}}{\sin^2{\theta}\cos^2{\theta}} \\
0 = A\sin^3{\theta} - B\cos^3{\theta} \\
\frac{B}{A} = \tan^3{\theta} \\
\theta = \arctan{\left( \frac{B}{A} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}} \\
$$ At this point, we can substitute $\theta$ back into the original equation for $L$ by interpreting $A^{1/3}$ and $B^{1/3}$ as sides of a triangle with angle $\theta$ and hypotenuse $\sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} }$: $$
\cos{\theta} = \frac{A^{1/3}}{ \sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} }} \\
\sin{\theta} = \frac{B^{1/3}}{ \sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} }} \\
\therefore L = A^{2/3} \sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} } + B^{2/3} \sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} } \\
L = (A^{2/3} + B^{2/3}) \sqrt{A^{2/3} + B^{2/3} } \\
L = (A^{2/3} + B^{2/3})^{3/2} \\
$$ The equation for the formula for the maximum length of the pipe is therefore $L = (A^{2/3} + B^{2/3})^{3/2}$.","['optimization', 'geometry', 'calculus', 'intuition']"

Intuitively, it seems there would be symmetry because all vertices are combinations of the same number of zeros, ones, and one k-1 element. This arXiv article seems to indicate that the polytope can be broken down into lower dimensional simplices, which also suggests some symmetry?

I'm using the model $G(n,p)$, where there are at most $n(n-1) \over 2$ edges (no self-loops or duplicate edges) and each edge has a probability $p$ of existing. I found a simple formula online  where $f(n)$ is the probability of $G(n,p)$ being connected. But apparently it's too trivial for the writer to explain the formula (it was just stated briefly). The desired formula: $f(n) = 1-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}f(i){n-1 \choose i-1}(1-p)^{i(n-i)}$ My method is: Consider any vertex $v$. Then there's a probability ${n-1 \choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-1-i}$ that it will have $i$ neighbours. After connecting $v$ to these $i$ neighbours, we contract them ($v$ and its neighbours) into a single connected component, so we are left with the problem of $n-i$ vertices (the connected component plus $n-i-1$ other ""normal"" vertices. Except that now the probability of the vertex representing connected component being connected to any other vertex is $1-(1-p)^i$. So I introduced another parameter $s$ into the formula, giving us: $g(n,s)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}g(n-i,i){n-1 \choose i}q^i(1-q)^{n-1-i}$, where $q=1-(1-p)^s$. Then $f(n)=g(n,1)$.

I think, the answer is negative: FDDs are restrictions of $\mu$ to a class of measurable rectangles that generate the product $\sigma$-algebra. Since this class is closed under finite intersections, and $\mu$ agrees with $\nu$ on this class, then $\mu= \nu$.

Then what is the value of $x$? $2(\log a+\log b)=4(\log b+\log c)=x(\log c+\log a)=\log a+\log b+\log c$ Then I am lost, any other easier way to solve?",['algebra-precalculus']
584537,There exist an infinite subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ such that any three vectors in $S$ are linearly independent.,Could anyone just give me hint for this one? There exist an infinite subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ such that any three vectors in $S$ are linearly independent. True or false?,['linear-algebra']
584539,A conjecture about triangular numbers,"There is one and only one pair of natural numbers $m$ and $n$ ($15$ and $21$) such that: $m$ and $n$ are triangular numbers; the sum of their squares is a triangular number ($666$); and the sum of the triangular numbers $m(m+1)/2$ and $n(n+1)/2$ is a triangular number $k(k+1)/2$ ($k=26$). I have tested pairs of numbers from $m+n=2$ to $m+n=100 000 000$ using a computer program. (Notice that $15, 20, 25$ is a Pythagorean triple, giving the sides of a triangle that's similar to the sacred Egyptian triangle $3, 4, 5$.) I know, $666$ is the number of the beast and all that stuff, but this is a serious mathematical problem.",['number-theory']
584551,Applications of Differential Geometry in Artificial Intelligence,"I am new to this wonderful site. I searched around a bit but I couldn't find any well-discussed posts on applications of differential geometry to artificial intelligence, or more generally to computer science.
I came across Riemannian Geometry a few months back via YouTube(lol) and have been hooked on it since. I even bought a textbook and started learning from there. I am an engineer and I have sufficient math skills to make sense of the book, but it hardly has any real life applications. Almost everything is ""Prove this"" or ""Theorem that"". So I wanted to know if there are any real-life implementable applications for CS. More specifically, in the field of AI and Machine Learning. From what I have understood, differential geometry allows us to ""see"",""understand"" and ""analyze"" curves in higher dimensional spaces. Is this accurate? And can this help in AI and Machine Learning? In subtopics like Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Computer Vision, Data analysis?
I would sure like to start off with a simple project which helps me understand differential geometry better. Thanks PS: Sorry if I have not framed this question well, it is my first question.","['computer-science', 'artificial-intelligence', 'differential-geometry']"
584554,Free-fall according to Newton's gravitation law,"Most analysis of free-fall assume that bodies fall with constant acceleration. If however one analyses  free-fall according to Newton's gravitation law, one is lead to a differential equation which I don't know how to solve. The differential equation one is lead to[1] is $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\frac{1}{x^2}$. Does this equation have a closed form solution with given initial conditions $x_0,v_0$? [1] If one picks the units so that $MG=1$, fixes one mass at $x=0$ and places the falling mass at some $x>0$.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'physics']"
