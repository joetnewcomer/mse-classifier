1199005,Confidence Intervals that Contain the Mean: Designing an Activity,"This past Wednesday, I had my stat class do the following exercise: Roll a fair 6 sided dice 25 times. Take the sample mean of the face value. Using the standard deviation of the uniform probability distribution, construct confidence intervals with $C=.90, .95, .99$. I had 16 groups total doing this exercise. All 16 groups found their 90% confidence intervals containing the the mean of the probability distribution (3.5.). I thought I would have at least one confidence intervals that wouldn't contain the mean... considering that the probability that all 16 confidence intervals contains $\mu$ would be $.90^{16} \simeq .1853$. Is my prediction completely flawed? Or was I just unlucky? Or is there something inherently wrong with my experiment?","['central-limit-theorem', 'probability', 'statistics', 'statistical-inference']"
1199016,What's wrong with my osculating paraboloid?,"I'm trying to learn about the Second Fundamental Form and I thought it would be fun to set up a surface in Geogebra and try to calculate the osculating paraboloid as I moved a point around on it, for certain values of ""fun"". I'm using Banchoff & Lovett's textbook. The red surface is parameterized by the horizontal grey xy-plane as $f(x, y) = (x, y, x^3-3xy^2)$. I've calculated the second fundamental form, I think correctly since I did it myself and my result matches what's in the book (it's a worked example). The osculating paraboloid, I thought, should be $g(x, y) = 1/2(L_{11}x^2 + 2L_{12}xy + L_{22}y^2)$. This is plotted as the greenish-yellow surface. As you can (perhaps) see, my ""osculating paraboloid"" doesn't osculate very nicely. In fact, the point p, at which it's calculated, isn't even on it at all. Nevertheless, when I move p around I can see the paraboloid doing something sensible, and ""nearly right"". I've looked in multiple references and although I find the same formula repeated many times I haven't been able to figure out what crucial part I'm missing. In case anyone's interested in playing with the Geogebra file, here's a link (Dropbox). To move p, click and drag q (in the coordinate plane); everything else is self-explanatory I think.",['differential-geometry']

1199097,Why does my particular solution to $y''-y'-2y=2e^{-t}$ via variation of parameters not match that by undetermined coefficients?,"The particular solution to $y''-y'-2y=2e^{-t}$ found by the method of undetermined coefficients is $Y(t)=-\frac{2}{3}te^{-t}$ However, when I find the particular solution via the method of variation of parameters I obtain a different expression.  I would really appreciate someone to point out where my calculations go awry. First I find the fundamental set of solutions for the analogous homogeneous equation $y''-y'-2y=0$ which are $y_1(t)=e^{-t}$ and $y_2(t)=e^{2t}$.  Then I use these to find the Wronskian $W(y_1,y_2)(t)=3e^t$.  Then I plug these values into the following equation to get the particular solution: $$Y(t)=-y_1(t)\int \frac{y_2(t)g(t)}{W(y_1,y_2)(t)}dt+y_2(t)\int\frac{y_1(t)g(t)}{W(y_1,y_2)(t)}dt$$
Where $g(t)=2e^{-t}$ is the non-homogeneous term. $$Y(t)=-e^{-t}\int\frac{e^{2t}2e^{-t}}{3e^t}dt+e^{2t}\int\frac{e^{-t}2e^{-t}}{3e^t}dt$$
$$=-e^{-t}\int\frac{2e^t}{3e^t}dt+e^{2t}\int\frac{2e^{-2t}}{3e^t}dt$$
$$=-e^{-t}\int\frac23dt+e^{2t}\int\frac23e^{-3t}dt$$
Finally giving:
$$Y(t)=-\frac23te^{-t}-\frac29e^{-t}$$ So why doesn't this particular solution match the one obtained from undetermined coefficients?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

1199230,Disjoint convex sets which cannot be separated by any continuous linear functional,"This problem is out of Rudin's Functional analysis exercise 3.2. The problem is stated below. I'm really struggling with this chapter in general. It has a lot of new topics I have not seen before. Any help is appreciated. I am attaching some of my current thoughts on the problem. Suppose $L^2 = L^2([-1,1])$, with respect to Lebesgue measure. For each scalar $\alpha$, let $E_\alpha$, be the set of all continuous functions $f$ on $[-1,1]$ such that $ f(0) = \alpha$. Show that $E_\alpha$ is convex and that each is dense in $L^2$. Thus $E_\alpha$ and $E_\beta$ are disjoint convex sets (if $\alpha \neq \beta$) which cannot be seperated by any continusous linear functionals $\Lambda$ on $L^2$. Hint: What is $\Lambda(E_\alpha)$. proof: Suppose the given hypothesis above. To show convexity let functions $f, g \in E_\alpha$ be arbitrary. Then we observe that $h(x) = tf(x) + (1-t) g(x)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$ is a continuous function and that $h(0) = t f(0) + (1-t)g(0) = t\alpha + (1-t)\alpha = \alpha.$ Therefore $h(x) \in E_\alpha$ and we have $E_\alpha$ convex. To show that $E_\alpha$ is dense in $L^2$. Let $A$ be a collection of continuous functions in $L^2$. Need to show that $E_\alpha \cap A \neq \emptyset$, but not sure how... I assume that given $\epsilon > 0$ we need to take an arbitrary function $f \in A$ and show there exists a function $g \in E_\alpha$ such that for $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$,
$$
\|h(x)\| = \left ( \int_{-1}^{1}|h(x)|^2 d\mu \right )^{1/2} < \epsilon
$$ It makes sense that the sets $E_\alpha$ and $E_\beta$ are disjoint because every function in each of them will have a different value at $0$. But the last statement confuses me. Also I am struggling with the hint, is $\Lambda(E_\alpha) = 0$? I know that $L^2$ is its own dual space, since $p=2$ and its conjugate $q=2$ as well, so $\Lambda \in L^2$. It seems like symmetry of interval may have something to do with it, along with convexity or $E_\alpha$.

It means we want to have as much variance in measurement of one type as possible and as little covariance between measurements of different types as possible. $P$ is a matrix whose rows are the new basis vectors. As it turns out below, it's best to take eigenvectors of our original covariance matrix (expressed in original basis) as the new basis. First, the most important question: 1) the $i^{th}$ diagonal value of $C_{y}$ is the variance of $X$ along $p_i$. Could you explain why? Are they equal to eigenvalues of the corresponding eigenvectors? Why? 2) Can we always rotate the data points so that covariance matrix of the data is diagonal? It's quite surprising for me that this matrix always exists. 3) PCA is about minimizing redundancy and maximizing variance of measurements of the same type. OK, we can obtain a diagonal covariance matrix - it means all terms of the matrix not on its diagonal are zero, so we minimized them (thus PCA eliminates redundancy completely). But how does it maximize the variance (terms on diagonal)? We don't do anything to maximize them actually... Source","['statistics', 'linear-algebra']"

1199538,Normal of a coons patch at a given point,"Disclamer: Rendering the Coons patch is part of 3D Graphics homework, but finding the normals at a given point isn't. Just curious. Here's what I got so far: It's a Coons patch defined by four Hermite curves. I render the Coons patch by making a mesh of triangles from points calculated on the Coons patch. The surface could look much smoother than it actually is if I could figure out how to get the normal of the patch at any given point, instead of using the normals of the flat triangles. Now I know that if I have two tangents of the surface at a given point, their cross product will give me what I look for. I also know that, for an Hermite curve in 2D space, finding the tangent means getting the derivative, which is easy if you see Hermite curve as a product of matrixes and the vector (1, t, t^2, t^3); just use this vector instead (0, 1, 2t 3t^2). The normal is just the perpendicular of the tangent then: But how do I translate that knowledge into finding the two tangents necessary for finding the normal of the Coons patch at a given point? My shaky programmer maths fail me. EDIT: Here's how I build my Coons patch. Taken at Wikipedia . The 4 curves are Hermites. Given four space curves c 0 (s), c 1 (s), d 0 (t), d 1 (t) which meet at four corners c 0 (0) = d 0 (0), c 0 (1) = d 1 (0), c 1 (0) = d 0 (1), c 1 (1) = d 1 (1); linear interpolation can be used to interpolate between c 0 and c 1 , that is $L_c(s,t)=(1-t) c_0(s)+ t c_1(s) $ and between d 0 , d 1 $L_d(s,t)=(1-s) d_0(t)+ s d_1(t) $ producing two ruled surfaces defined on the unit square. The bilinear interpolation on the four corner points is another surface $ B(s,t) = c_0(0) (1-s)(1-t) + c_0(1) s(1-t) +  c_1(0) (1-s)t + c_1(1) s t. $ A bilinearly blended Coons patch is the surface $L_c(s,t)+L_d(s,t)-B(s,t). $","['differential-geometry', '3d', 'surfaces']"

I have tried to prove this using characteristic functions. Let $\hat{\mu}_{X_n},\hat{\mu}_{Y_n},\hat{\mu}_{Z_n}$ be the characteristic functions of the corresponding random variables. Let $X$ (resp. $Y$) be the distributional limit of $X_n$ (resp. $Y_n$), with characteristic function $\hat{\mu}_{X}$ (resp. $\hat{\mu}_{Y}$). It is easy to show using the uniform convergence on compact sets of the $\hat{\mu}_{X_n}$ and $\hat{\mu}_{Y_n}$ that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \hat{\mu}_{Z_n}$ exists on some small ball $B_{\epsilon} := \{z \in \mathbb{R}^d : |z| \leq \epsilon\}$, and that the limiting function is continuous at $0$. This is `nearly' enough to conclude, but the problem is, there is no way of checking that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \hat{\mu}_{Z_n}$  exists on the set $A:=\{z \in \mathbb{R}^d : \hat{\mu}_{Y}(z)=0\}$. This is why I get stuck. Many thanks for your help. EDIT: (Proposed solution) What is said above is enough (c.f. Chung, page 170-171) to conclude that any subsequence of ${\mu}_{Z_n}$ has a further  subsequence converging to a probability measure. It is enough to show that the characteristic functions of these potentially different limits are the same. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are the characteristic functions of limits of subsequences of subsequences of ${\mu}_{Z_n}$. Then they are both continuous (by Arzela-Ascoli and contents of Chung Theorem 6.3.1). Moreover by the considerations above, $f$ and $g$ agree on the set $A^c:= \mathbb{R}^d \setminus A$ where in fact the limit of $\hat{\mu}_{Z_n}$ exists. It is therefore enough to show that any point in $A$ can be written as the limit of some points in $A^c$. But if this were not the case, $\hat{\mu}_Y$ would vanish on some small ball $D:= B(z_o; \epsilon)$ centered on $z_0 \in\mathbb{R}^d$ with radius $\epsilon$. Integrating shows therefore that $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \int_D 1 - \cos \langle z, x \rangle dz \mu_Y(dx) = 0 $$ and this is impossible unless $Y=0$ almost surely (I think) in which case the claim is trivial.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'characteristic-functions', 'probability', 'convergence-divergence']"

To show the upper bound, divide the hexagon into 6 regular triangles with sides 1 and note that one of them must contain 4 points. To show the lower bound, divide the hexagon into 24 regular triangles with sides 1/2 and draw a point at each of the 19 corners. Addition. Here's an idea: Let $\Omega$ be a subset of the plane obtained by gluing together regular, side-1 triangles side-to-side. Let $n$ be the total number of corners.

1200110,Intuitive explanation of the term manifold,"I am reading Christopher Bishop's ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" and in the first chapter, where he talks about the curse of dimensionality, he gives the following example: Consider, for example, an application
  in manufacturing in which images are captured of identical planar objects on a conveyor
  belt, in which the goal is to determine their orientation. Each image is a point in a high-dimensional space whose dimensionality is determined by the number of
  pixels. Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and
  in different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between
  images, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded
  within the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the
  object position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly
  nonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the
  orientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of
  freedom of variability within the manifold that is significant. I haven't took a course on differential geometry before; but I have some informal ideas on what manifolds are. I thought them as low dimensional continuous (not in a rigorous way) subsets of high dimensional Euclidean Spaces. For example, a curved surface of a blanket can be considered as a manifold in the space of a room. Well, that explanation does not work when it comes to a more rigorous text like in the above. How should I understand the term ""manifold"" in the context of the above paragraph? I see that there is a high dimensional space, with the dimension equal to the number of pixels in the given images. But the definition of the three dimensional manifold is not exactly a three dimensional (""three pixel"" sized images) subset of the image pixels exactly. It sounds like that a transformation function is applied to each point (image) in this high dimensional space and each high dimensional point is mapped to a three dimensional point in some three dimensional space. (Consisting of x,y coordinates and an orientation angle). But I don't see how this is related with a manifold. So, how should I understand the term ""manifold"" in such a context, in an informal and intuitive way? Is this something completely different from my sloppy understanding of the term?","['differential-geometry', 'calculus', 'machine-learning']"

This is fine, I understand it. However, he then goes on to define a special kind of coupling, a deterministic coupling of $(\mathcal{X},\mu)$ and $(\mathcal{Y},\nu)$ which satisfies: There is a measurable function $T$ such that $\mathcal{Y} = T(\mathcal{X})$ $\pi =(Id,T)_\# \mu $ (where # denotes the pushforward measure). Point number 2 is what confuses me. $\pi$ is defined over $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$, however for any subset $E$ of $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$, $(Id,T)_\# \mu (E) = \mu((Id,T)^{-1}(E))$ but $\mu$ is only defined over $\mathcal{X}$, so I'm not sure how $\mu((Id,T)^{-1}(E))$ makes sense?

And of course $x=y^2$ shows both positive and negative $y$ values. So why does this happen with this? EDIT: My girlfriend pointed out that in $x=y^2$ the $x$ technically cannot be negative cuz if the $y^2$ will never be negative. But why do graphs show the negatives? And I forgot to show you the site where it graphs the negatives: http://www.coolmath.com/precalculus-review-calculus-intro/precalculus-algebra/09-sideways-parabolas-01",['algebra-precalculus']

$$\sum_k \binom{2 k}{k} \binom{2n - 2k}{n - k} = 4^n$$
is found on page 187 of ""Concrete Mathematics"" by Knuth and Graham.  The book does not prove it combinatorially. Is there a proof of this identity using double counting?

1200544,Finding the limit $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[3]{x+1}-\sqrt[3]{x}$,I am trying to  find this limit $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[3]{x+1}-\sqrt[3]{x}$$ My so far method is this $f(x)>0.$ $f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2}}-\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{x^2}}<0.$ For every $0<y<1$ the equation $f(x)=y$ has a unique solution(found in maple): $$x=\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{\frac{1}{3}y^2(3y^2+\sqrt{-3y^4+12y})+\frac{1}{6}\frac{3y^2+\sqrt{-3y^4+12y}}{y}-y^4-2y}{y}$$ The previous facts implies that the limit is $0$. I am wondering if there is any way easier than this to find the limite. thanks in advance.,"['limits-without-lhopital', 'analysis', 'radicals', 'limits']"
1200565,Prove $\operatorname{rank}(AB) = \operatorname{rank}(B)$,"I am given the info that A is an invertible  m by m matrix and B is a m by n matrix. By solving for the null space $ABx=0$, I get $A^{-1}ABx=A^{-1}0$, therefore $Bx=0$. I concluded that the null spaces of A and AB must be equivalent, and therefore the nullity(AB) = nullity(B) = some number p. Therefore rank(AB) = n-p = rank(B)   (because both AB and B are m by n matrices).   Is this proof valid, specifically the null space step?","['matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'matrices']"
1200575,What is the value of $\prod_{i=1}^\infty \left(1-\frac{1}{2^i}\right)$? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : How to solve the limit $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}(1-a)(1-a^2)\cdots(1-a^n)$? (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . Also, what about in general, for some value p , which has the value 2 in the given formula? MOTIVATION: I was wondering the probability of never getting tails if one forever flipped a coin whose probability of landing tails decreased (in this case, geometrically) each flip. The probability of tails on flip i is $\frac{1}{2^i}$ , and the probability of heads on flip i is $1-\frac{1}{2^i}$ . So, first flip the coin is 50-50, next it is 75-25, etc. And the probability of never landing tails is equal to the probability of always landing heads , which is the infinite product of the heads probabilities, yielding $\prod_{i=1}^\infty \left(1-\frac{1}{2^i}\right)$ . => ( $\frac{1}{2} * \frac{3}{4} * \frac{7}{8} ...$ )","['sequences-and-series', 'probability', 'infinite-product']"
1200578,Polynomial has roots in any ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ but not in $\mathbb{Z}$,"I have to prove that the polynomial
$$(X^2-13)(X^2-17)(X^2-221)$$
has roots in all rings $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ but not in $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $221 = 13\cdot 17$, we can use the multiplicativity of the Legendre-symbol if $n$ is prime and see that $\left(\frac{13\cdot 17 }{n}\right), \left(\frac{13}{n}\right), \left(\frac{17}{n}\right)$ can't all be $-1$. But for general $n$ I am stuck. If I use the Chinese remainder theorem, I still have to show that the polynomial has roots modulo a power of a prime number.",['number-theory']
1200583,Computation of 2nd homology using Hopf's formula,"Let $G$ be a group and $G'$ be a group obtained from $G$ by adding a one generator $x$ and relations $gx=xg$. That is, $G'=G\times\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_2(G')=H_2(G)$. Problem. Prove $H_2(G')=H_2(G)$ using Hopf's formula. Suppose that we fix a presentation of $G$, say $G=F/R$. Then, $G'=F'/R'$, where $F'=F\ast \mathbb{Z}\langle x\rangle$ and $R'$ is a subgroup generated by $R$ and $[y,x]$ for all $y\in F$. Hopf's formula shows $H_2(G)=\frac{R\cap [F,F]}{[F,R]}$ and $H_2(G')=\frac{R'\cap [F',F']}{[F',R']}$. Since $[y,x]\in [F',F']$ for all $y\in F$, $R'\cap [F',F']$ contains $R\cap [F,F]$ and all words of the form $[y,x]$. However, I could not see that why $[y,x]$'s lie in $[F',R']$.
