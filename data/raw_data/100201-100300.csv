1388498,Classical and Modern Zariski Topologies,"I am trying to understand the connection between the ""classical"" Zariski topology on a variety, that is closed sets defined as the vanishing set of some ideal, $V(A)$, and the ""modern"" topology on the prime spectrum, that is closed sets defined as the set of all primes containing some ideal, again denoted $V(A)$. By the nullstellensatz, given any ideal $A$, the set of maximal ideals containing $A$ can be identified precisely with the vanishing set of A, in the classical sense. But in the new topology, we must also include the non-maximal primes containing $A$. My question is, can we describe such new primes which must be introduced explicitly? In reading Mumford, in the case of $k[X,Y]$ at least, it is stated that closed sets in Spec can be formed by taking finitely many closed points and irreducible curves along with their generic points. But then given an irreducible curve in the old topology, considering it as composed of maximal ideals, do we need only to add a generic point to make it closed in the new topology?

I don't think my Algebra and Trig are good enough Is this the main reason students fail Calc? Because their pre-Calculus is just shoddy?
I did well in pre-Calc stuff by itself, barely passed Calc 1, and struggled through Calc 2, getting a little bit of each concept down, but I'm not proficient in any specific section (Integration, Log functions, Sequences/Series, etc)
I basically died toward the end of the semester in both classes, being crushed by the workload and just not ""getting"" some presumably basic stuff the instructor was talking about during the Finals review. I just could not at all manipulate trig functions or even polynomials and stuff at will. I'm retaking Calc 2 this Fall and before the new semester starts I'm wondering if I should look over all the Algebra formulas and stuff.

1388588,"What can we actually do with congruence relations, specifically?","Let $T$ denote a Lawvere theory and $X$ denote a $T$-algebra. Under my preferred definitions: A subalgebra of $X$ consists of a $T$-algebra $Y$ together with an injective homomorphism $Y \rightarrow X$. A quotient of $X$ consists of a $T$-algebra $Y$ together with a surjective homomorphism $X \rightarrow Y$. Also: A congruence on $X$ is a subalgebra of $X^2$ that happens to be an equivalence relation. Now it turns out that we can go back and forth between congruence
   relations and quotient objects. So ""congruence relation"" is basically
   a technique that allows us to include the poset of quotients of $X$
   into the poset of subalgebras of $X^2$. Okay, but how does this help
   us? What can we actually do with this inclusion? Question. What are some specific examples of things that can be done with congruence relations, which would be very hard or even impossible to do without them? For example, one thing we can do is ""pull back"" any predicate defined on subalgebras of $X^2$ to obtain a predicate on quotients of $X$. However, a good answer should be more specific than this; I'd like specific examples of where this is done and why it is important.","['motivation', 'abstract-algebra', 'universal-algebra', 'congruence-relations']"

Then what functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ are continuous? I think the constant functions would be continuous. The range of any such function (not constant) has to be countable. One can pick an open interval around one of $f(x')$, $x' \in \mathbb{N}$, such that no other $f(x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{N}$ lies in that open interval. The inverse of this open set under $f$ would not be open in co-finite topology being a finite set. Thus constant functions are the only continuous functions.

1388722,Distribution of Primitive Elements Finite Fields Prime Order,"It is well known that the integers modulo a prime $p$ form a finite field and that the multiplicative group of this finite field is cyclic, with $\phi(p-1)$ different possible choices of primitive elements that generate the cyclic group. However, if one calculates these primitive elements for various primes, their distribution seems random. So my question is whether anything is known about this. For example, suppose one works out the average of all primitive elements. One would expect that there is no bias in the size of this average, so that over various primes it should be roughly $p/2$. To quantify this conjecture, one would expect that if you divided the average by $p$ for each prime, then the average of all these values up to a prime $P$ tends to $1/2$ as $P \to \infty $. This seems like one of those statements that seems like it should be true due to lack of ""biases"" or ""conspiracies"", but is virtually hopeless to prove. Is anything known about this? ( Note that this example of the averages that should on average be $1/2$ was an example, I wonder in general about distribution: can the primitive elements all be small, all large, can they bunch up, spread out, etc. I hope I got the general gist of my question across.

I'm interested in $C^\ast$-algebras and I would like to begin with the study of classification of $C^\ast$-algebras soon. I think, this is a huge field and I heard that K-Theory for operator algebras is an important tool for classification (but I still don't know something about K-Theory). My question is: What exactly is meant by classification of $C^\ast$-algebras? What are interesting properties which $C^\ast$-algebras do have in common? Could you give me a short overview or do you know good literature for beginners, which gives a good overview or introduction of classification of $C^\ast$-algebras? I still know that every $C^\ast$-algebra could be identified with a sub-$C^\ast$-algebra of one of these three $C^\ast$-algebras: $C_0(X)$ (X localcompact, Hausdorff space), $C(X)$ (X compact, Hausdorff space) or $L(H)$ ($H$ is a Hilbert space). But it seems that classification means something different in this case, maybe something similar as in algebraic topology, if you consider homology of topological spaces for example. 
In the field of algebraic topology, you can consider homology or cohomology of topological spaces to distinguish between the spaces. Greetings","['k-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'c-star-algebras', 'analysis', 'reference-request']"

1388864,I am confused by the different definitions of manifolds.,"I'm currently learning manifold from Do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry. This is his definition of differentiable manifold: But this is different from what I saw in wiki: A differentiable manifold is a topological manifold equipped with an equivalence class of atlases whose transition maps are all differentiable. In broader terms, a Ck-manifold is a topological manifold with an atlas whose transition maps are all k-times continuously differentiable. Carmo defines differentiable structure on a set, so nothing about continuity of the mappings can be said. While wiki's definition is on topological space in the first place, therefore it make sense to require the charts to be homeomorphism. Moreover, the mapping directions of Carmo's $\bf{x_\alpha}$ and the charts are just the opposite. After defining differentiable structure on set $M$, Carmo then define a $A\subset M$ be open iff $\textbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}(A\cap\textbf{x}_\alpha(U_\alpha))$ is open in $\mathbb R^n$ for all $\alpha$. From this I can see that $\textbf{x}_\alpha$ are continuous. My question is that, are these two definition talking about the same thing? Why do they seems so different? Also, I don't understand why Carmo requires  $\textbf{x}_\alpha^{-1}(W)$ to be open. And how come there are homeomorphism in wiki's definition, but not in Carmo's?

I need to integrate the following: $$\int_{0}^\infty \frac{xdx}{(x+\theta)^4} $$ I approached this via partial fractions and used the following decomposition: $$ \frac{x}{(x+\theta)^4} = \frac{A}{x+\theta} + \frac{B}{(x+\theta)^2} +\frac{C}{(x+\theta)^3} + \frac{D}{(x+\theta)^4} $$ which led to $$ x = (A)x^3 + (A\theta +2A\theta +B)x^2 + (A2\theta^2 + A \theta^2 +2\theta +C)x + (B\theta^2 + D + A\theta^3) $$ then equating coefficients yields the following system $$A = 0 \\
A\theta +2A\theta + B = 0 \\
2A\theta^2 + A \theta^2 + 2\theta + C = 1 \\
B\theta^2 + D + A\theta^3 = 0$$ resulting in the following values: $$ A=0\\
B=0\\
C=1-2\theta\\
D=0$$ and plugging these back in gives $$ \frac{x}{(x+\theta)^4} = \frac{1-2\theta}{(x+\theta)^3}$$ But, Wolfram is telling me that $$ \frac{x}{(x+\theta)^4} = \frac{1}{(x+\theta)^3} - \frac{\theta}{(x+\theta)^4}.$$ I thought that maybe these would yield the same result, but they definitely do not.

1390096,Poincaré hyperbolic geodesics in half-plane and disc models including outer branch,"The objective of this post is to state that: 1) the Poincaré  hyperbolic metric results in a solution of complete geodesic circles in both half-plane and disk models. 2) the choice of one or other is quite arbitrary. 3) while for the half plane model negative side arbitrariness provides no new solution or insight, the disc model hyperbolic geodesic proposed outside the horizon/boundary can be validated in full. EDIT1: The derivation of geodesics of the two models follows in a straightforward  manner from the metric. For the half-plane we have in Cartesian coordinates $$ ds^2 = (dx^2 + dy^2)/y^2  \tag{1} $$ Employing Euler-Lagrange (from calculus of variations approach )(primes wrt x) $$ s = \int \dfrac{\sqrt{ 1 + y^{'2}}}{ y } dx,\,\tag{2}  $$ the functional is $$ F =\dfrac{\sqrt{ 1 + y^{'2}}} { y } \tag{3}$$ $$ F - y^{'}\dfrac {\partial F }{ \partial y^{'} }  = 1/c  \tag{4}  $$ where c is an arbitrary constant leading  to (since $ y^{'}= \tan\phi,$ $\phi =$ inclination to x-axis), $$ \cos \phi = \frac{y}{c} \tag{5}  $$ $$ \frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{\sqrt{c^2-y^2}}{y} \tag 6 $$ Let $ y^2= v,\, 2y dy = dv $ Integrating $$-2 \sqrt{c^2-v} = 2x-2h \tag7$$ where $2h$ is an integration constant. $$ (x-h)^2 + y^2 = c^2 \tag8 $$ which are all all full circles centered on x-axis and lying on either side of x-axis. Argument about distances. Whether we approach from below the x-axis or from above, x-axis is at an infinite distance so lower symmetric half part may have been excluded (by Poincaré). Distance to points on x-axis is infinite whether we take the upper half or the lower, it appears to be entirely arbitrary. I.e, either of them could serve as a valid geodesic model. But **the disc model has no such direct reflective symmetry, but possesses definitely an ""inversion symmetry"" arising from same metric  **. Similarly for the disc in Polar coordinates (primes with respect to $\theta $ ) we land into a situation for an arbitrarily forced choice of range. $$ s = \int \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } d\theta,\, \tag{9} $$ Where $T$ is a more convenient symbol for the radius of fundamental circle than unity as we shall see.. $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } - \dfrac{ r{'}}  {( T^2- r^2)  }  \cdot \dfrac{r^{'}}  {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}} = C_1 \tag{10} $$ and after error indicated by $A.\Gamma.$ corrected it leads to $$ \frac{r^2}{T^2-r^2}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+r'^2}}=C_1.\tag{11} $$ Using substitutions of (12) and (14) we get Equation (15) that is an ODE of product of segments constant property for an entire circle . At tangential point $T$ where $\psi =0,  \pi $ we have the horizon/boundary circle $r=T.$ which  are orthogonal red trajectories to unit ""horizon"" circles obtained by integrating this ODE. However they are these orthogonal hyperbolic geodesic circles on either side of the horizon or boundary. It is well known that the half plane model is a special case of disc model where unit disc radius tends to $ \infty$ . Why Poincaré had deemed the portion of the red circle lying  outside the horizon as not belonging to $ \mathbb H^2 $ .. is to me not clear, so the question here. EDIT 2: ( .. In response to (since deleted) workaholic's request for showing the above to be hyperbolic geodesics by integration) Instead of integrating an eccentric circle in polar coordinates (8) can be differentiated to directly obtain pure formula of curvature in polar coordinates in $\mathbb R^2$ . $$ \kappa_g = \dfrac{r^2 + 2 r^{'2 }- r r ^{''}}{{(r^2 +  r^{'2}})^{3/2}} = 2 C_1 $$ Direct integration is needlessly cumbersome and when direct methods are yielding the result readily. A second way is the following. In the diagram above let $$ OT =1=T, K=-1/T^2, MCB =\psi, OA =r, BC =a ,..$$ $$ AM = MB = a \sin \psi, C_1 = 1/(2 a)\tag{12}$$ where $a$ is another convenient arbitrary constant. Note that the central circle has a radius $=T$ which is tangent to all arbitrary circles of radius $a$ . If inversion circle/mirroring circle has radius $T,$ the inner hyperbolic geodesics are inversions of outer geodesic circles (and vice-versa)  now brought into picture. $$ \dfrac{r}{T^2-r^2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 + u^2 }} = \dfrac{1}{2 a} \tag{13} $$ where by geometry of differential right triangle $$ u = \cot \psi = \dfrac{dr} {r d \theta }\tag{14} $$ $$ 2 a r \sin \psi = T^2 - r^2 $$ $$ r ( r+ 2 a \sin \psi) = T^2 \tag{15}$$ $$ OA \cdot OB = OT^2 = T^2 \tag{16}$$ which relation is readily recognized as the Circle property that product $T^2$ of the two cutting segments on circle is square of tangent $T$ or its power . Alternately in a third method we can get the above into Liouville's form for $2D$ curvature by differentiation with respect to arc and simplifying: $$ \psi^{'} + \dfrac{\sin \psi}{r} = \dfrac{1}{a}  \tag{17} $$ Yet a fourth way to compute geodesics from Poincaré metric (9) is to take the object function for geodesic $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } \,\tag{18}$$ and apply Euler-Lagrange theorem of calculus of variations $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } - \dfrac{ r{'}}  {( T^2- r^2)  }  \cdot \dfrac{r^{'}}  {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}} = 1/2a \tag{19}  $$ where wlog the constant is taken as reciprocal of diameter $2a.$ Simplifying, $$ \dfrac{r}{ (T^2-r^2) } =\dfrac {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{2a} \tag {20}$$ Since in differential form we can plug in from (14) $$ \cot \psi= \dfrac {r^{'}}{r} \tag {21} $$ (20) simplifies to an eccentric circle radius $a$ and power $T$ which is the arbitrary hyperbolic geodesic: $$ \dfrac{\sin \psi}{r}= \dfrac{1}{2a}\cdot \dfrac{r^2-T^2}{r^2} \tag {22} $$ BTW, the name geodesic has been introduced by Liouville. External geodesics mentioned here are inversions of internal geodesics with respect the boundary of unit radius horizon circle as mirror of inversion. $$ r_{outer geodesic} \rightarrow T^2/ r_{inner geodesic} \tag {23} $$ Thus we have circles of arbitrary radius $a$ orthogonally cutting $T$ radius  as valid Poincaré disk model in $ \mathbb H^2 $ on either side of the boundary circle which is hence no truncated geodesic arc in this sense, considered  from Poincaré's defining metric. Either side/segment is equally valid. All points outside the horizon are at an infinite distance to the horizon along the given external geodesics $TQB$ as well. The outside hyperbolic geodesics mentioned here are indicated in red to complement with internal purple Poincaré hyperbolic geodesics around a unit (T=1) ""boundary"" in magenta. EDIT 3: Distance of nearest (inner) and farthest (outer) hyperbolic geodesics from any point For a constant curvature $-1 /T^2$ Poincaré disk (Klein-Beltrami)  model metric hyperbolic distance $ (0,0) - (r,0) $ $$ \frac{4 \,ds^2}{(T^2-r^2)} \tag{24}$$ $$ s=T^2\int_0^r \frac{2 dr}{T^2-r^2}= T \log\frac {T+r}{T-r} =2\,T \tanh^{-1}(r/T) \tag{25} $$ Finding Euclidean distances in the eccentric circle orthogonal to the hyperbolic boundary circle as: $$r^2-2 a r \sin \psi -T^2 =0,    \quad, r (r-2 a \sin \psi)=T^2 \tag{26}  $$ Roots of quadratic: $$r_{1,2}= a \sin \psi \pm \sqrt{(a \sin\psi)^2 +T^2} $$ Taking positive radius and plug in from above using $(h^2=a^2+T^2)$ $$r_{1,2}= a \sin \psi \pm \sqrt{h^2-(a \cos\psi)^2},\quad r_1\cdot r_2=T^2  \tag{27} $$ $$\frac{ s_{1,2}}{T}= log \,\frac{T+\sqrt{h^2-(a \cos \psi)^2}+a \sin \psi}{T -\sqrt{h^2-(a \cos \psi)^2}-a \sin \psi} \tag{28} $$ So the metric can be defined to work both ways $$ \pm \frac{4 \,ds^2}{(T^2-r^2)} \tag{29}$$ Points on the present new outer hyperbolic locus points $(B,Q)$ correspond to the conventional inner hyperbolic locus points $(A,P)$ of disc model obtained by mutual inversions. A diameter of the boundary circle maps to line at infinity in inversion. Their Euclidean distances are $ (h-a, h, h+a) $ respectively,  for the inner/outer extreme distant hyperbolic points. Plugging in from (27) these hyperbolic distances are respectively: $$ T \,log \frac{T+h+a}{T-h-a},\quad \infty,\,T \,log \,\frac{T+h-a}{T-h+a} \tag{30}$$ Cross-Ratio is same for inner and outer hyperbolic arcs Cross Ratio of a pencil of four concurrent rays depends upon angles enclosed between them...as it is one valid way to define them. Whether the transverse cutting is by a straight line, a circle cutting them inside the tangent points as in case of standard Poincaré  model or cutting them outside of the tangent points as in the model presently being proposed is hence one and the same. When the Poincaré arc/geodesic shrinks to zero size, then in the limit a circle passing through the pencil point of concurrency on its arc anywhere stands as a valid and simple hyperbolic geodesic. It forms a special case when $T=0,\sin \psi= r/2a$ ... and yet another special case when touching externally..","['calculus-of-variations', 'differential-geometry', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"

We will call this the usual open set axiomatization of a topological space. The open set axiomatization is probably the most economical, but of course there are other ways as well, such as the Kuratowski closure axioms which axiomatizes the topology using the closure operator. In his note here , Pete L. Clark gives several alternative characterizations of a topology, most of which have details given. It was mentioned, I think originally by Willard, that it is ""possible, but unrewarding to characterize a topology completely by its [boundary]"". I could find no further references on this, and I am wondering how it might be done (unrewarding as it may be). So my question is this: How can a topological space by axiomatized using the boundary operation as the primitive notion?

I want to compute the holonomy around this circle. I know that if $(\theta, \phi)$ are spherical coordinates, where $\theta$ measures the angle from the $x$-axis (as in polar coordinates) and $\phi$ measures the angle from the $z$-axis, we can pull back the Euclidean metric to find
$$ds^2=d\phi^2 + \sin^2 \phi \ d\theta^2.$$ Then traveling around the circle means fixing $\phi$ and moving theta from $0$ to $2\pi$. However, actually computing parallel transport along this curve in coordinates seems really messy. Is there a way to do it in the ambient coordinates that would make the calculation easier? I tried to do the computation in coordinates and it didn't go so well. We are looking to parallel transport vectors along $\gamma(t)=(t,\phi_0)$, with $t\in[0,2\pi]$. We have $\gamma'(t)=(1,0)$. Any vector field $V(\theta)$ along the curve extends in the obvious way: $\tilde V(\theta, \phi)=V(\theta)$, so it suffices to look at extensions that are just a function of $\theta$. Note $D_t=\nabla_\theta$. If $$V=a(\theta)\partial_\theta + b(\theta)\partial_\phi,$$
we need 
$$D_tV=0,$$
or
$$\nabla_\theta(a(\theta)\partial_\theta + b(\theta)\partial_\phi)=0.$$
Writing everything out and noting that a few of the Christoffel symbols vanish, I get the following system. $$a'(\theta)+b(\theta)\Gamma^\theta_{\theta \phi}=0.$$
$$b'(\theta) + a(\theta)\Gamma^\phi_{\theta\phi}=0.$$ I get $$\Gamma^\theta_{\theta \phi} = \frac{\cos \phi}{\sin \phi},$$
$$\Gamma^\phi_{\theta\phi}=-\cos \phi \sin \phi.$$ We get solutions

$$b(\theta)=\sin (\phi) \sin(\theta \cos \phi).$$ At $\theta=0$, we have $X=(1,0)$.
At $\theta=2\pi$, we have $$Y=(\cos(2\pi \cos \phi), \sin\phi \cdot \sin(2\pi \cos \phi).$$

My work: this is part (b) of a question that I am working on.  For part (a), I described the conformal mapping, showing that it maps the unit disk to the right half-plane. I know that $f$ harmonic means that for every $(x,y)$ in the interior of the disk, we need that $f_{xx}(x,y) + f_{yy}(x,y) = 0$. It also needs to take values +1 for $(x,y)$ on the upper semi-circle, and -1 on the lower semi-circle. I tried writing $f(z)$ as $$f(x,y) =\frac{(1+x)+iy}{(1-x)-iy}$$ How can I proceed?

implies that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}=0$ for all $i$. Let $a\in \mathbb{R}^n$. For this $a$ we have $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(a)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a_1+h,a_2,\cdots,a_n)-f(a_1,\cdots,a_n)}{h}=0$$ Seeing this as single variable function and using mean value theorem we see that $f(a_1+p,a_2,\cdots,a_n)=f(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$ for all $p\in\mathbb{R}$ For $p=-a_1$ we have $f(0,a_2,\cdots,a_n)=f(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$ Now, do the same thin for $f(0,x_2,c_3,\cdots,x_n)$ and conclude that
 $f(0,0,\cdots,a_n)=f(0,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$. Combining with previous result we have  $f(0,0,\cdots,a_n)=f(0,a_2,\cdots,a_n)=f(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$. Repeating this, we get $f(0,0,\cdots,0)=f(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n)$. Thus, $f$

I know that when I post this question people are going to tell me to do some research myself but I did it and I am still having problem understanding it.
I watched youtube videos and read articles ...etc but I still do not understand. To be specific, let me tell you where I am stuck. For example If we have a sample size of 3 {x1,x2,x3} is the set of sample values At the same time, we assume that we know the sample mean is going to be equal to be 2 knowing there are 3 variables, the first 2 variables can be anything. Say, x1 = 1, x2 = 4. With  simple calculation we know x3 must be 1 for the sample mean to become 2. In another word, when first and second variables are determined, the third variable must be specific value(not free to be any value) to meet the fact that sample mean must be 2. Ok, until this point everything makes sense to me. When it comes to calculating the variance, I am totally confused. In each and every videos and articles I watched and read always says the same thing. The reason why degree of freedom for estimating the variance is N-1, which N is the sample size. The reason for that is because we know the sample mean is going to equal to specific value in the first place . This logic sound quite contradicting to me!! The reason why we need a sample mean instead of the population mean is because we do not know the value of population mean in the first place. Now you are telling me that we know the sample mean is going to be specific value as if we already know the population mean? In another word, if we don't know what the population mean is, how are we possibly going to know what value our sample mean is even close to? Does not the entire concept just sound contradicting? Maybe it is just because of my lack of knowledge but if that is the case, can anyone help me out by explaining to me the concept in simple English? To summarise the question: I do not understand why in the first example, we want to assume the sample mean is going to be 2 , since in reality when we draw a sample from a population we don't even know the population mean, so how are we going to know sample mean is going to be 2? @ImATurtle, Thanks for your detailed answer. In response to your answer, I understood that knowing the sample mean is necessary for calculating sample variance. However, my problem is I don't really get how you are going to know the sample mean before you even know all your sample values in the first place. For example, given sample values are {2,3,4,5,6}, we know that the sample mean is 4 only after you draw the sample and do the calculation . The five sample values were freely drawn from the population without doubt. Yet, people keep on saying that we know the sample mean will be 4, therefore after drawing the sample values 2,3,4,5, we know the fifth value is 6. So, what make it possible for us to predict the sample mean is going to be 4 before we even start drawing samples from population?",['statistics']

So, unlike the Cartesian system where each point has a unique set of coordinates, in the polar system any point can have an infinite number of coordinates!

1390891,"False proof: $\pi = 4$, but why?","Note: Over the course of this summer, I have taken both Geometry and Precalculus, and I am very excited to be taking Calculus 1 next year (Sophomore for me). In this question, I will use things that I know from Calculus, but I emphasize that I have not taken the course, so please bear with me. This will be long. Among other Geometric formulas that I have learned recently, I am currently trying to prove that the surface area of a sphere is $4\pi r^2$. Intuitively, this seems fairly straightforward for me, since I have already proven the volume of a sphere using integration to be $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$, and that the integral of the circumference of a circle is its area. Using these two facts together, it makes sense that the integral of the surface area of a sphere should be its volume, leading me to believe the formula for surface area stated above. However, this is a very weak argument, since I make the connection between circumference to area and area to volume without much proof. As an alternative, I made a proof involving infinite sums of the lateral areas of cylinders squeezed into a sphere. One can use this method of infinite cylinders to prove the volume of a sphere, but when I tried almost the exact same thing for surface area, I found that the value of pi is 4 . I have only heard of one other strange proof that leads to this result, and it can be found here: Is value of $\pi = 4$ . It was promptly disproved in numerous ways, some of them here: How to convince a layman that the π=4 proof is wrong? As far as I know, there's nothing wrong with my math -- I most likely simply set up the problem incorrectly. Here's what I did: Consider a sphere of radius $r$, aligned with the coordinate plane in a way that its center is the origin. To approximate the surface area (or volume) of this sphere, we can imagine fitting $n$ stacked cylinders into it, each with a center on the line $x = 0$. Each cylinder has a height $h$, or $\Delta y$. Since the height of the sphere is $2r$, $h = \frac{2r}{n}$ Looking at a cross-section of this sphere, the radius of each cylinder must satisfy the equation: $r_i^2 + y^2 = r^2$ where $r_i$ is the radius of the cylinder with index $i$, and the radius of the sphere is $r$. Now, we sum the lateral areas of the cylinders to get an approximation for the surface area of the sphere. As $n \rightarrow \infty$, our approximation gets better, so $A = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sum_{i=1}^n{2\pi r_i (\frac{2r}{n})}} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sum_{i=1}^n{2\pi r_i \Delta y}}$ In other words: $\int_{-r}^r{2\pi r_i   dy}$ And as we already know, $r_i = \sqrt{r^2-y_i^2}$ So we substitute and take out constants: $2\pi \int_{-r}^r{\sqrt{r^2-y^2} dy}$ From here, we have two options: 1) Take the integral and find something very messy; 2) Recognize that the expression inside the integral is just a semicircle, and that a semicircle has half the area of a circle. Choosing option 2), I end up with: $2\pi \frac{\pi r^2}{2} = \pi^2 r^2$ Which is clearly not the surface area of a sphere, but I can't figure out why. Strangely, another ""proof"" I did also led to this result. Take the semicircle $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ with arclength $\pi r$ and rotate it about the x axis $2\pi$ radians. We now have a sphere, with surface area $2\pi^2 r^2$. Something is clearly wrong here, but it gets stranger. If we simultaneously accept Archimedes proof of the surface area of a sphere, we find: $\pi^2 r^2 = 4\pi r^2$ And by ""solving for $\pi$,"" we find that: $\pi = 4$. I'm not looking for a better proof or someone to convince me that Archimedes is right, as I fully accept the textbook formula and have used other proofs to show it. I have a feeling that I may have approached the sphere in a ""non-smooth"" way, since the zig-zag shape that the cylinders make is eerily like the method used in the classic $\pi = 4$ proof, and when I used polygonal approximations I got a valid answer. Thanks for reading all the way through this, and does anyone know how I messed up?","['spheres', 'pi', 'analytic-geometry', 'integration']"

We can define the secant variety $\mathscr{S}(X)$ of $X$ to be the closure in $G(1,n)$ of the image of $s$. I'm struggling with a couple of details that are supposed to be obvious in Harris's introductory book: 1) Why is it clear that every tangent line to $X$ is in $\mathscr{S}(X)$? This is Exercise 15.9, which is supposed to be ""relatively straightforward."" If we work over $\mathbb{C}$, I think it's intuitively clear by showing that it's in the closure in the analytic topology, but in general I don't know of a good way to show something is in the closure, without picking an arbitrarily function that vanishes on the image of $s$ and trying to show that it also vanishes on tangent lines. 2) There is a second way method mentioned in Exercise 15.11, where we take the rational map $s:X\times X\rightarrow G(1,n)$ and extend it to an honest map $Bl_\Delta(X\times X)\rightarrow G(1,n)$. Why is it clear that each fiber of $Bl_\Delta(X\times X)\rightarrow X\times X$ over a point $(p,p)$ in $\Delta$ is sent to the projective space of lines through $p$ in $T_pX$? Googling seems to say the exceptional divisor is the projectivized tangent bundle, and, if I squint, I might be able to think that, as $q$ approaches $p$, the line through $p$ and $q$ approaches a tangent line at $p$, and $(p,q)$ approaches the point in the fiber over $(p,p)$ corresponding to that line, but I don't know how to write it out.","['blowup', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1390991,Prove that a group of order $p^2q$ has a proper normal subgroup and is solvable.,"So, going through my qual prep classes, there's a two part question:  For $p,q$ distinct primes, prove that a group of order $p^2q$ has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup,  then prove that it's solvable.  Part 2 is pretty trivial given the first, but I've been struggling with it. Thoughts so far:  Attacking with Sylow theorems, if $n_p=1$ or $n_q=1$ we'd be done,  so assume neither are one (either for contradiction or to find a group of order $pq$, since I'll show later that such a group would have to be normal) So,  given that we need $n_p=q$ and $n_q=p$ or $n_q=p^2$,  but since we also need $n_p>p$ and $n_q>q$,  we must have $p<q<p^2$, and $n_q=p^2$.  We also have $q=pk+1$ and $p^2=qj+1$ for some natural numbers $k,j$ due to congruency,  but I couldn't seem to find a contradiction out of here. Now, since $p$ is the smallest prime,  if I could find a subgroup of order $pq$, it would have index $p$ and thus be normal by the theorem that groups of the smallest prime index of a group are normal.  However, I can't seem to figure out why either that would have to be the case, or why the above statements are a contradiction to force a normal $p^2$ group or a normal $q$ group.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

1391011,What can be said about a function with rotational symmetry of order other than 2?,"It is well known that an odd function is a function whose graph has rotational symmetry of order $2$ (about the origin). Suppose the graph of $f:U \to \Bbb{R}$ has rotational symmetry of some higher order $n$, where $U \subset \Bbb{R}$. What can be said about $f$? Some things include: The graph of $f$ must be disconnected (by applying the symmetry of the graph to the vertical line test). In particular, if $U$ is an interval, $f$ cannot be continuous. Such $f$ exist for certain disconnected $U$, and can be as nice as you like given their domain (e.g., piecewise linear). For a trivial example, let the graph of $f$ consist of the vertices of some appropriately rotated $n$-gon. This can easily be extended to a function on some union of intervals. When $n=3$, it is possible to define $f$ on an interval with some deleted points (start with $f(x)=1$ for $x \in (-a,a)$ and extend by symmetry, with $a$ being as large as possible without collision), but at least in this case there's no way to consistently fill in the deleted points. Is there any such function which is defined on an interval? If so, how badly behaved does it have to be (e.g., can it be piecewise continuous? must it be non-measurable?)","['algebra-precalculus', 'functional-equations']"
