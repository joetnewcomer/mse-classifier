2824544,BlackJack Card Counting Probabilities,"Note: This is related to this question but I'm going to frame the problem in a completely different way (hopefully a more productive way). Lets say we have a 2-deck blackjack game, half of the cards have been seen, 52 remain unseen.  We know that we have seen 5 more low cards than high cards (low cards = 2/3/4/5/6, high cards = 10/J/Q/K/A, neutral = 7/8/9). Ultimately I'm trying to determine the probability that the next card dealt will be a high card. There are 104! possible shuffles of 2 decks of cards, but in this case we don't care about suits, or even the specific card value, we just care about Hi/Lo/Ne(utral) Taking that into account the number of possible shuffles is 104! / (40!*40!*24!) - which still equals a very huge number (2.5e+46) - too big for me to write code to brute force this problem. Problem 1 - How many of those possible shuffles results in 5 more low cards than high cards in the first 52 cards? Problem 2 - What % of those have 17 high cards remaining? 18? 19? etc (there are somewhere between 17-28 high cards remaining unseen)","['statistics', 'probability', 'card-games']"

-1&1\\
1&2\\} $$ First, the answer is yes . I gave my professor two reasons: Reason #$1$: $$$$The matrix $A=\pmatrix{
-1&1\\
1&2\\}$ is invertible, since it has a nonzero determinant, thus all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is in the image of $A$. In other words, the row vectors form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ since they are linearly independent and span $\mathbb{R}^2.$ She marked, ""explain."" Reason #$2$:$$$$ The systems $A\vec{x_1}=\vec{b_1}$ and $A\vec{x_2}=\vec{b_2}$ are consistent where $A=\pmatrix{
-1&1\\

2824577,Inverse Fourier transform of $\text{sinc}(t)^{1/k}$,"This question is a follow-up to a statistics question on crossvalidated.SE where we are looking to see if it is possible for the difference of two independent random variables to be uniformly distributed from negative to positive unity.  We have discovered that a necessary condition for this outcome is to have a distribution with a Fourier transform with squared-norm equal to a reciprocal power of the sinc function (the Fourier transform for the uniform distribution).  The present question is seeking to find out if this is possible or not. So, with that in mind, I would like to know if there is any probability density with a characteristic function that is a reciprocal power of the sinc function .  For a density $f$ with this property, the Fourier transform  $\hat{f}$ is the function: $$\hat{f}(t) = \text{sinc}(t)^{1/k} \quad \quad \quad \text{for } k \in \mathbb{N}.$$ For $k=1$ the inverse Fourier transform $f$ is known to be a rectangular pulse function (i.e., a uniform density).  I am mostly interested in the result when $k=2$, but the general result is also of interest to me. Update: It has been pointed out in the comments that $z^{1/k}$ is a multi-valued function, and I have not specified which branch I am using.  Given the above motivation for the problem, unless I am mistaken (and I might be, so please tell me if I am), it should not matter which branch is used.","['probability', 'fourier-transform']"

2824606,Prove that $H\cap gHg^{-1}$ is normal,"This problem is from a Ph.D Qualifying Exam from algebra: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H \le G$ with index $[G:H]=n$. If $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$ and $H$ is abelian, show that $H\cap H^g$ is a normal subgroup for all $g\notin H$, where $gHg^{-1} = H^g$. Now suppose that $G$ is simple. If $H$ is abelian and $n$ is prime, prove that $H$ is trivial. My attempt: Let $G$ act on $(G/H)^2$ by componentwise left multiplication. Then the stabilizer of the element $X=(H,g^{-1}H)\in (G/H)^2$ is precisely $H\cap gHg^{-1}$. Therefore, $|GX|=[G:(H\cap H^g)]=[G:H][H:(H\cap H^g)]\le n^2$, so we conclude that $[H:(H\cap H^g)]\le n$. Now I'd like to exploit this property to solve 1, so I tried as follows: Let $G$ act on $GX$ just as on $(G/H)^2$, then the action induces a homomorphism $\phi:G\to S_{GX}$. Clearly, $\ker(\phi)\le H\cap H^g$, but I have no idea how to show the reverse inclusion. For 2, I tried as follows: Since $H$ has prime index in $G$, $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$. Therefore, by 1, $H\cap H^g =1$ for all $g\notin H$. Then how should I prove that $H=1$ from this fact? Any hints or advice will help a lot!

2824611,"Katz&Mazur's book: what is meant by ""universal morphism"" here?","I am currently reading Katz and Mazur's book ""Arithmetic Moduli of Elliptic Curves"", which can be found here . My question concerns the proof of proposition 1.6.2, page 23 of the book. First, the context is the following. Let $C/S$ be a smooth commutative group-scheme over a scheme $S$ of relative dimension $1$. Let $A$ be a fixed ""abstract"" finite abelian group. For any integer $N\geq 1$, we define the $S$-subgroup-scheme of $C/S$ of points of order $N$: for any $S$-scheme $T\rightarrow S$, we have $$C[N](T)=Ker\left(N:C(T)\rightarrow C(T)\right)$$ 
  We fix an isomorphism of abelian groups $$A\simeq \mathbb{Z}/N_1\mathbb{Z} \times\ldots\times \mathbb{Z}/N_r\mathbb{Z}$$
  so that the functor on $S$-schemes $Hom_{S-gp}(A,C)$ defined by $$T\mapsto Hom_{gp}(A,C(T))$$
  is represented by the $S$-scheme of finite presentation $$C[N_1]\times _SC[N_2]\times _S \ldots \times _SC[N_r]$$ Under this context and these notations, the proposition is the following. The functor $A$-$Str(C/S)$ on $S$-schemes $$T\mapsto the\space set\space of\space A-structures\space on\space C_T/T$$
  is represented by a closed subscheme of $Hom_{S-gp}(A,C)\simeq C[N_1]\times _S \ldots \times _SC[N_r]$ definable locally by $1+\#(A) +\#(A)^2$ equations. Now, this proof is admittedly easy using the corollary 1.3.7, page 15. It states the existence of a universal closed subscheme for the relation ""a given effective proper Cartier divisor in $C/S$ is an $S$-subgroup-scheme"". In order to use this corollary, the ""universal"" effective Cartier divisor in $C\times _S Hom_{S-gp}(A,C)/Hom_{S-gp}(A,C)$ attached to the ""universal"" morphism $\phi _{univ}:A\rightarrow C$ is given out of the blue. This is now the part I do not understand. Where does this universal Cartier divisor come from? How is $\phi _{univ}$ defined? Moreover, in order to be coherent, shouldn't this morphism actually take value in $C\times _S Hom_{S-gp}(A,C)$? Any help in order to clarify this proof would be highly appreciated. I thank you very much. NB: for the definition of ""$A$-structure"", see page 20, 1.5.1. A morphism of abstract groups $\phi: A\rightarrow C(S)$ is an $A$-structure on $C/S$ if the attached effective Cartier divisor $\sum _{a\in A}[\phi(a)]$ is a subgroup of $C/S$.","['representable-functor', 'curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2824697,How many triangles are there in the 'picture' of $K_5$? Different ways to count it,"So, my cousin asked me to count the number of triangles in a picture. The picture was the complete graph on $5$ vertices, known as $K_5$ in graph theory. Here's a ""picture"" of $K_5$: A partial answer has been given here on MSE in this question which can be wrong depending on the interpretation of what a ""node"" is. In our interpretation of the problem, the intersection of two edges forms a new node. So, the points of intersection inside the pentagon lying on the edges of the inner star are considered nodes on their own and therefore, the formula given in that answer is indeed an undercount for our problem. I reasoned like this: Case I - triangles formed by all the three vertices on the pentagon: This is 
given by ${5 \choose 3}=10$ Case II - triangles with exactly one vertex on the pentagon: You see that in this case, the only way to form a triangle is to select the two other vertices on the inner star adjacent to our initial vertex on the pentagon. In this case since we have $5$ vertices, we get $5$ different triangles. Case III - triangles with exactly two vertices on the pentagon:
 I wish I could draw a picture for this case but I don't know how to do that. Anyway, in this case, we'll have $2$ separate cases: a) The two vertices are adjacent to each other: In this case, we get $3$ non-equivalent triangles. How many ways can we choose two adjacent vertices on the pentagon? $5$ ways. Therefore, we get $15$ triangles. b) The two vertices are not adjacent to each other: In this case, choosing two non-adjacent vertices gives us a triangle each time. For a fixed vertex on the pentagon, we can choose two non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, we get $10$ triangles this time. (This is wrong, please read my edit and the comments under the question.) I would highly appreciate a fancy solution that uses a combination of graph theory and group theory. I believe there should be an answer like that and if you have one, please post it with explanations. EDIT: As noted by zar, it seems that I have overcounted the number of triangles in case III b by a factor of two because after I choose a diagonal of the pentagon, I get a unique triangle. Of course, If I instead focus on the vertices on the pentagon, two vertices joined by a diagonal of the pentagon give rise to the same triangle in case III b and that's why I have overcounted by a factor of $2$. I still appreciate a systematic solution using recurrence relations, graph theory, group theory or anything that gives more mathematical insight and maybe can be generalized to problems involving $p$-gons.","['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'group-theory', 'recreational-mathematics']"

Let $f$ be $1-1$ and $A,B\subset X$. Let $y\in f(A)\cap f(B)$. Then there is $x_A\in A$ and $x_B\in B$ such that $y=f(x_A)=f(x_B)$. Since the function is injective, it must be the case that $x_A=x_B=x$ (say). $x\in A\cap B$. So $y=f(x)\in f(A\cap B)$. Therefore $f(A)\cap f(B)\subset f(A\cap B)$. Suppose now, that for all subsets $A,B$ of $X$ that $f(A)\cap f(B)\subset f(A\cap B)$ holds. Let $x_1,x_2\in X$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=y$ (say). Let $A:=${$x_1$} and $B:=${$x_2$}. If possible let $x_1≠x_2$. Then $A\cap B=\phi \implies f(A\cap B)=\phi.$ But, $f(A)\cap f(B)=${$y$}, which is nonempty. This contradicts the hypothesis. So $x_1=x_2$.

2824879,Constructing the reals using almost homomorphisms,"I'm learning set theory at the moment and there are a lost of gaps in my knowledge right now. I'm struggling to understand how the real numbers are constructed from equivalence classes of the set of almost homomorphisms on $\mathbb Z$. First of all, I feel like I should have a problem with equivalence classes even existing in ZFC. My main problem is that I don't really understand what an almost homomorphism is, and what it represents. As I currently understand, an almost homomorphism is a function such that $f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)$ is finite, so when we construct the reals we set each real number to be an equivalence class of the set of all those functions. I guess I'm having a hard time because I haven't seen any examples of almost homomorphisms and I just can't believe that there would be so many functions that are almost homomorphisms. I mean, what equivalence class would represent e.g. $1$ or $\frac{3}{2}$? And how are the reals ordered if they are representations of equivalence classes of functions? (I am aware there are other ways to construct the reals). Also, this is probably a stupid question, but seeing as there is a rational number between any two irrational numbers, why can't we find a bijection between $\mathbb Q$ and the irrationals, and thus between $\mathbb N$ and $\mathbb R$?","['real-analysis', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I am studying Serre's article, and in particular the 1st chapter, in view of an exam, and I am stuck at $\S 24$, where the author states the following: let $\mathfrak U$ be a cover of a topological space $X$ and assume the sequence $0\rightarrow \mathcal F\xrightarrow{\alpha} \mathcal G\xrightarrow{\beta} \mathcal H\rightarrow 0$ of sheaves is exact; then the following sequence (where by $C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal F)$ we mean the cochain complex associated to the cover $\mathfrak U$ and the sheaf $\mathcal F$) is exact
$$ 0\rightarrow C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal F)\xrightarrow{\alpha} C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal G) \xrightarrow{\beta} C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal H),$$ but the map $\beta$ need not be surjective. Now, I have a couple of questions about this, which I hope aren't too trivial (I am definitely neither an expert in homological algebra nor in sheaf theory, much less algebraic geometry): why is that the sequence of cochain complexes is exact in the first two complexes and not in the third, that is, why is $\alpha$ necessarily injective and the sequence exact in $C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal G)$, while $\beta$ is not surjective? By this I mean: where's the error in the following proof for the surjectivity of $\beta$? (I have an idea but I want some feedback) Let $h\in C(\mathfrak U,\mathcal H)$ and assume $h$ is mapped to zero by the map induced by the map $\mathcal H\rightarrow 0$ (I denote thi map by $\phi$). Then for each $s\in I^{q+1}\quad (\phi h)_s=0$. That is
$
\phi(h_s)=0
$
by definition. By surjectivity of $\beta$ at sheaf level I can find a section $g\in\mathcal G$ such that $\beta(g_s)=h_s$, that is $(\beta g)_s=h_s$, which is the same as $\beta g=h$ by the sheaf axioms. Hence $\beta$ is surjective at cochain level. can anybody provide an example of an exact sequence of sheaves where $\beta$ is surjective in the induced sequence of complexes and one in which $\beta$ is not?

2825195,proof of the surjectivity of a function that satisfies certain properties [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : $|f(x)-f(y)|\geq k|x-y|$.Then $f$ is bijective and its inverse is continuous. (1 answer) Closed 6 years ago . Let $f\colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ be a continuous function such that $|f(p)-f(q)|\geq a|p-q|,\quad \forall p,q\in\mathbb R^2$ and $a>0$. Show that $f$ is injective and surjective (therefore has inverse) and that its inverse is continuous. This is a problem from a metric space topology test that I did. The most important contents of the test were uniform convergence, equicontinuity, Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem, iterated functions, Stone-Weierstrass Theorem etc. The exercise is very simple and I believe it is possible to solve it by more elementary concepts. I already showed that $f$ is injective so my problem is surjectivity. For surjectivity i've tried something like this: since $f$ is injective it follows that $\exists g \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ such that $\left(g\circ f\right)(x)=x$. On the other hand $f$ is a right inverse for $g$ which implies that $g$ is surjective. I was trying to show that $g$ is injective but i did not get anything. I have also shown that $f^{-1}$ is continuous (assuming $ f $ is surjective). Thank you very much!",['real-analysis']

I think my example is interesting. It is a discrete valuation on $k(x,y)$ whose corresponding valuation ring is not a localization of $k[x,y]$ , unlike what one may conjecture (unless I am mistaken somewhere).

2825293,"Show that if the restriction f : [0, ∞) → R of f to the interval [0, ∞) is strictly decreasing, then f : R → R is strictly decreasing","A function $f: \Bbb R\to \Bbb R$ is odd if $f(−x) = −f(x)$ for all $x\in\Bbb R$. Let $f:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ be an odd function. Show that if the restriction $f\vert_{[0,\infty]}: [0, \infty)\to\Bbb R$ of $f$ to the interval $[0, \infty)$ is strictly decreasing, then $f:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R $ is strictly decreasing. My thought process is as follows: Proof. Suppose there exist real numbers u and v such that v>u. We must consider three cases: $\quad (\textrm{i})$ Suppose $v>u \geq 0$ then $f(v)<f(u)$, as $f\vert_{[0,\infty]}:[0, \infty)→ \mathbb{R}$ is strictly decreasing. $\quad (\textrm{ii})$ If $u<v<0$, then $-u>-v>0$, and therefore $f(-u)>f(-v)$. Since $f$ is odd, $\quad f(v)=f(u)$. $\quad (\textrm{iii})$ Suppose $v \geq 0$ and $u<0$. Since $f$ is odd, $f(0)=f(-0)$, and as $f:[0, \infty)→ \mathbb{R}$ is strictly $\quad$ decreasing, $f(v) \geq 0$ and $f(-u)>0$. Thus, because $f(-u)>0$, we have $-f(u)>0$, i.e. $\quad f(u)<0$. Therefore, $f(v) \geq 0 >f(u)$. In all three cases, $f(v) \geq  f(u)$, and so we see that $f$ is strictly decreasing. QED I was hoping for proof verification, specifically when it comes to all these inequalities, which I've had a hard time wrapping my head around.

2825324,Rank one orthogonal projector matrix.,"My text is covering projector matrices while building up to Householder triangularization. The main topic of discussion is orthogonal projector matrices that satisfy \begin{align} P &= P^2 \tag{1} \\ P &= P^* \tag{2} \end{align} It turns out that we can form a rank one orthogonal projector with any orthonormal vector $q \in \mathbb{C}^m$ \begin{align} P_q = qq^* \end{align} which is easily verified to satisfy (1) and (2). $P_q$'s rank $m-1$ complement is then found by $P_{\perp q} = I - P_q$. So far these facts and definitions all make sense to me. But I'm having a little trouble with the following: my book goes on to say that analogous projector matrices for arbitrary nonzero vectors $a$ can be written \begin{align}
P_a &= \frac{aa^*}{a^*a} \\ \\
P_{\perp a} &= I - P_a 
\end{align} It's easy to verify that these formulas satisfy (1) and (2) but what is the motivation for the scaling factor of $a^*a$? For example \begin{align}
P_av = \left(\frac{a^*v}{a^*a}\right)a \implies \| P_av\|_2 
     =\frac{\left|a^*v\right|}{\|a\|_2^2} \|a\|_2\
     = \frac{\left|a^*v\right|}{\|a\|_2} \tag{*}
\end{align} Why the scaling factor? Is it true that $a^*v = \|a\|_2\|v\|_2\cos(a,v)$ for higher dimensional complex vectors? I that case (*) becomes \begin{align}
\|v\|_2 \left|\cos(a,v)\right|
\end{align} In hindsight that seems to make sense. $P_av$ is just putting $v$ on $a$ and scaling it to be an orthogonal projection. I guess my true question is: is the 2-norm function equivalent to the modulus function in complex spaces?

The article gives the least squares error function between the real coordinates and the coordinates yielded by the to-be-derived Bezier function as: $ E(C_y) = \sum^n_{i=1} \left ( y_i - B(t_i) \right )^2$ Which makes a lot of sense, and then restates this as a matrix expression: $ E(C_y) = \left ( y - \mathbb{T}MC_y \right )^T \left ( y - \mathbb{T}MC_y \right ) $ In this, $y$ is the y-coordinate vector, $M$ is the Bernstein polynomial coefficients for the Bezier curve in matrix form, $C_y$ is the ""y coordinates we're hoping to find, to use in constructing a well-fitting curve"", and $\mathbb{T}$ is a matrix of ""powers of $t$ specific to fitting a curve to the polygon described by the original coordinates.

Before they start to play the game, Bob wants to calculate its chance of winning to determine if he has a positive expectation. The game works as follows. Charlie starts throwing two dice and he records the sum of the two dice each time. If at a certain point a sequence of two $7$s in a row occurs, Alice wins the game and the game ends. If on the contrary, a sequence of three strictly increasing numbers occurs, Bob wins the game and the game ends. What is the probability that Bob (or Alice) wins the game? I am looking for a theoretical method of solving this problem. I tried a few different ones but it all didn't seem to work. I am thinking that some version of using Markov chains could work, although I don't see how. After doing some simulations I found: The expectation of the number of tries before a sequence of two $7$s is a row occurs, is approximately $42$. The expectation of the number of tries before a sequence of three increasing numbers is a row occurs, is approximately $10.5$. It doesn't seem to work to divide the expectations of the number of tries although you come close, i.e., there is probably some dependence relation going on. The probability of Alice winning is approximately $19\%$. Edit : I got the following probabilty of Alice winning to be equal to
$$ \frac{450074090171}{556534555787} \approx 80.87\% $$

2825623,Conflicting Results from t-test and F-based stepwise regression in multiple regression.,"I currently am tasked with building a multiple regression model with two predictor variables to consider.  That means there are potentially three terms in the model, Predictor A (PA), Predictor B (PB) and PA*PB. In one instance, I made a LS model containing all three terms, and did simple t-tests.  I divided the parameter estimates by their standard errors to calculate t-statistics, and determined that only the intercept and PA*PB coefficients were significantly different from zero. In another instance, I did stepwise regression by first creating a model with only PA, and then fit a model to PA and PB, and did an F-test based on the Sum of Squares between the two models.  The F-test concluded that PB was a significant predictor to include in the model, and when I repeated the procedure, the PA*PB coefficient was found to reduce SSE significantly as well. So in summary, the t-test approach tells me that only the cross-product term PA*PB has a significant regression coefficient when all terms are included in the model, but the stepwise approach tells me to include all terms in the model. Based on these conflicting results, what course of action would you recommend?","['regression', 'statistics']"

The following is the definition of reals that he provides in the text: $\DeclareMathOperator*{\LIM}{LIM}$ Definition 5.3.1 (Real numbers). A real number is defined to be an object of the form $\LIM\limits_{n → ∞} a_n$, where $(a_n)_{n = 1}^∞$ is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. Two real numbers $\LIM\limits_{n → ∞} a_n$ and $\LIM\limits_{n→∞} b_n$ are said to be equal iff $(a_n)_{n = 1}^∞$ and $(b_n)_{n = 1}^∞$ are equivalent Cauchy sequences. The set of all real numbers is denoted $\mathbb{R}$. Problem: While snooping around the internet I have found that a real number is in fact an equivalence class of sequences of rationals whose corresponding terms can be arbitrary close to each other i.e $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ and $(b_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ are equivalent if and only if 
$$\forall ε>0, \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ \text{such that} \ \forall n \ge N, \ |a_n-b_n|\leq ε.$$

For the Chern classes, we consider $G = \mathrm{U}(n)$ and the skew-hermitian matrices $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{u}(n)$. What is nice is that every element in $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ is conjugate to an element in the Cartan subalgebra $\mathbb{C}^n$ (diagonal skew-hermitian matrices) of $\mathfrak{u}(n)$, and the conjugacy classes in the Cartan subalgebra correspond to the orbits of the Weyl group $W_{\mathrm{U}(n)} = S_n$. So we can identify the adjoint invariant polynomials on $\mathfrak{g}$ as the symmetric polynomials on $n$ variables. My question is when does this behavior (that is, every element of $\mathfrak{g}$  can be taken into the Cartan subalgebra by the adjoint action, and the orbit of the restricted action on the Cartan subalgebra is equal to the orbit of the Weyl group) occur?

I was looking at Pythagorean Triples and noticed another property apart from how $a^2+b^2=c^2$ . Here are the first $30$ Pythagorean Triples $(a,b,c)$ ordered from smallest to greatest value, i.e. $$(a,b,c)\qquad\text{ s.t. }\qquad a<b<c.\tag*{$\big(\text{s.t. = such that}\big)$}$$ I noticed that $a^2=(c+b)(c-b)$ , but that is trivial since $$\begin{align}a^2&=(c+b)(c-b)\tag{given} \\ &=c^2-b^2 \\ \Leftrightarrow\,\,\,\, a^2+b^2&=c^2.\end{align}$$ However, I also noticed that by having "" $u\mid v$ "" be read as "" $u$ divides $v$ "", it appears that $$a+b+c\mid abc.$$ For example, $(a,b,c)=(3,4,5)$ is a classic Pythagorean Triple; $3^2+4^2=5^2$ .

I would like to make sure I understand the notations well. The context is the following: Let $S$ be a scheme and $Z/S$ a finite locally free scheme over $S$ of rank $N\geq 1$. This means that for any affine $S$-scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow S$, the $R$-scheme $Z_R/R$ obtained from $Z/S$ by base change is of the form $Spec(B)$ ($Z_R \rightarrow Spec(R)$ is finite hence affine), where $B$ is an $R$-algebra which as an $R$-module is locally free of rank $N$. Any element $f\in B$ acts by multiplication to define an $R$-linear endomorphism of $B$. Because $B$ is a locally free $R$-module of rank $N$, we can speak of the characteristic polynomial of this endomorphism $$\det(T-f)=T^N-\operatorname{Trace}(f)T^{N-1}+\ldots+(-1)^N\operatorname{Norm}(f)$$ which is a monic polynomial in $R[T]$ of degree $N$. (A justification for this last fact can be found on this related issue , for which any clarification is also welcome.) Now, here comes the definition. We say that a set of $N$ not necessarily distinct points $P_1,\ldots, P_N$ in $Z(S)$ is a full set of sections of $Z/S$ if for every affine $S$-scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$, and for every function $f$ on $Z_R$ (ie $f \in B=H^0(Z_R,\mathcal{O})$), we have the equality of polynomials in $R[T]$ $$\det (T-f)=\prod _{i=1}^N(T-f(P_i))$$ All right, now my question may sound basic (and I apologize if it is), but I am unsure about how to make sense of $f(P_i)$. What does it mean? How can we apply an element of $B$ to a morphism $S\rightarrow Z$? My guess is that such a morphism becomes $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow Z_R$ after base change (it is defined by the composite morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(R)\rightarrow S \rightarrow Z$, together with the identity $\operatorname{Spec}(R) \rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(R)$). Then, it induces a map on global section $B\rightarrow R$, which may then be applied to $f$ to get an element of $R$. Is this construction what is really intended here? Moreover, if this is the case, wouldn't it make more sense to write $P_i(f)$ instead? I thank you very much for you help.","['schemes', 'notation', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2825978,Is $f'(a)$ Not same as Finding Derivative of $f(x)$ and Substituting $x=a$,"I got this doubt regarding the differentiability of function $f(x)$ at $x=0$ where $$f(x)= \begin{cases}

2826014,Is there a continuous bijection from open unit interval to open unit disc?,"I came across a problem asking the reverse of the titular question: Prove that there is no continuous bijection from $B_1(\mathbb{0}) = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 < 1\}$ to $(0,1)$. This I did as follows: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is such a map $f$. Consider the map $g : B_1(\mathbb{0}) \setminus \{ \mathbb{0} \} \to (0,1) \setminus \{ f(\mathbb{0}) \}$ given by $g(\mathbb{x}) = f(\mathbb{x})$. Then $g$ is also a continuous bijection. The continuous image of a connected set must be connected, and the domain is connected, so the image must be contained in either $(0,f(\mathbb{0}))$ or $(f(\mathbb{0}),1)$, which contradicts surjectivity. Hence, proved. I then decided to try and prove the claim in the other direction: Q. Is there a continuous bijection $f : (0,1) \to B_1(\mathbb{0})$? But, the same idea failed to work. After removing a point from the domain and its image from the codomain, I have two disjoint intervals on the one hand and a connected space on the other. I tried taking a path in the codomain connecting two points, each lying in the image of the two components of the domain. But since the inverse of $f$ is not assumed to be continuous, I couldn't proceed further. I'm not sure what to do next. Can someone help me prove or disprove the claim?

2826053,Projective space definitions,"My questions are as follows: Are all these different definitions of projective space equivalent? For example, Bezout's theorem holds under all 4 definitions (with an appropriate change in terminology)? Are the projective topological spaces obtained under Zariski and usual topology homeomorphic? (though both are compact but the one with Zariski is not Hausdorff) Algebraic geometry [Hartshorne] Firstly, we define affine n-space over an algebraically closed field $k$, denoted as $\mathbb{A}^n$, to be the set of all n-tuples of elements over $k$. Then we give it Zariski topology where the closed sets are the vanishing of polynomials, i.e. for $T\subset k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ the closed sets are $Z(T)=\{p\in \mathbb{A}^n: f(p)=0 \ \forall f\in T\}$. Secondly, we define projective n-space over $k$, denoted as $\mathbb{P}^n$, to be the set of equivalence classes of $(n+1)$-tuples of elements over $k$, not all zero, under the equivalence relation given by $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)=(\lambda a_0,\ldots, \lambda a_n)$ for all $\lambda\in k\backslash {0}$. Then we give it Zariski topology where the closed sets are the vanishing sets of homogeneous polynomials, i.e. for $T\subset k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ set of homogeneous poylnomials (graded ring) the closed sets are $Z(T)=\{p\in \mathbb{P}^n: f(p)=0 \ \forall f\in T\}$. Then we observe that both of these spaces are Noetherian topological spaces , and hence they are compact (w.r.t. Zariski topology) but not Hausdorff (since infinite sets). Moreover, we can show that any two curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$ intersect, as well as powerful statements like Bezout's theorem (whihc we can use to prove Pascal's theorem about conics). Algberaic topology [Hatcher] The projective $n$-space $\mathbb{F}\mathbb{P}^n$ is the space of all lines through the origin in $\mathbb{F}^{n+1}$, where $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Each such line is determined by a nonzero vector in $\mathbb{F}^{n+1}$, unique up to scalar multiplication, and $\mathbb{F}\mathbb{P}^n$ is topologized as the quotient space of $\mathbb{F}^{n+1}-0$ under the equivalence relation
$v\sim \lambda v$ for scalars $\lambda \neq 0$. Then we observe that $\mathbb{F}\mathbb{P}^n$ is a compact Hausdorff space. But, $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n$ have different CW-complex decomposition and homology groups. Projective Geometry [Coxeter] Axioms for the development of two-dimensional projective geometry: Any two distinct points are incident with just one line. Any two lines are incident with at least one point. There exist four points of which no three are collinear. The three diagonal points of a quadrangle are never collinear. If a projectivity leaves invariant each of three distinct points on a line, it leaves invariant every point on the line. Then, we can have various examples of theorems in finite geometry, denoted by $PG(n,q)$ where $q=p^m$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $m$. We have Desargues theorem. Projective space of a vector space [O'Connor] Given any vector space $V$ over a field $F$, we can form its associated projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$ by using the construction $\mathbb{P}(V) = V - \{0\}/\sim$ where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation $u \sim v$ if $u = 
\lambda v$ for $u, v$ belongs $V - \{0\}$ and $\lambda$ belongs $F$. Examples are $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, can take $F$ to be a finite field. We have Desargues theorem.","['finite-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry', 'projective-space', 'algebraic-topology']"

2826123,Odds of Coming Out Ahead in Roulette,"I have an interesting roulette problem that I initially thought was easy but now I'm second guessing my self. The problem is as follows: A friend of yours thinks that he has devised a purely mathematical way of beating the standard European roulette wheel, which has 37 pockets. His plan is to come to the roulette table with 100 units with which to bet. On each spin, he places a one-unit, single-number bet. (Recall that winning such a bet returns 36 units to the winner.) He will make exactly 100 bets, no matter how much he wins or loses. He claims that this strategy results in a greater than 50% chance that he will come out ahead at the end of 100 spins, so using this strategy repeatedly will make him a winner. a) Does he have a greater than 50% chance of coming away with more money than he started with? b) If the answer to the previous question is yes, then does that make his strategy a winning one, meaning that it will lead to a long-term increase in bankroll? So for part A I think he does have a greater than 50% chance of coming away ahead. He needs to win at least 3 times in order to walk away with more than he started with. And the probability of winning at least three times is 50.939% (I did 1 - the probability of winning 0, once, or twice with p=(1/37).) So based on that it seems like he does have a greater than 50% chance of walking away ahead... This goes against my intuition, especially for part b. If everyone could do this strategy and come out ahead then they would. But surely it can't be this simple... I don't see how this would lead to a long term increase in bank roll.
