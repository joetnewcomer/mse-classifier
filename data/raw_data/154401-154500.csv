2604577,Global section of line bundle of degree 0,"Let $\mathscr{L}$ be a line bundle on a curve $C$ such that $h^0(C, \mathscr{L}) = 1$ and deg $\mathscr{L} = 0$. Why does it imply that $\mathscr{L}$ is the trivial line bundle? I found some explanation in Vakil's notes here , which I don't quite understand. We know that degree of $\mathscr{L}$ can be computed by counting zeros and poles of any rational section. Say $s$ is a section of $\mathscr{L}$, then $s$ must have no pole, and since $\mathscr{L}$ has degree 0, $s$ must also have no zero. That means $s$ is invertible. But why does this then imply that $\mathscr{L}$ is the trivial line bundle?","['line-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2604666,Proof that a pair is injective and surjective,"Sorry in advance for my poor maths skills. I've picked up maths in a computing course after over a decade of being away from the subject. I have a question where I need to show if the below function is injective and / or surjective. $f: \mathbb{Z}{\times}\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ $f(a,b)=a + b + 3$ If I use a non-pair I know how to solve this, I would say $f(a) = f(b)$ and solve this and see if it works for integer numbers. But with a pair as the input I'm a bit confused as to how to show whether this is injective / surjective or not. for example: $f(a_0, b_0) = f(a_1,b_1) \\ 
a_0 + b_0 + 3 = a_1 + b_1 + 3 \\
a_0 + b_0 = a_1 + b_1$ If I then say 
$ a_0 = 0, b_0 = 1, a_1 = 1, b_1 = 0$ $ 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 $ So the equation works even though the inputs were different. Is this proof that this function is not injective?",['elementary-set-theory']

2604773,Is there a variant of the implicit function theorem covering a branch of a curve around a singular point?,"I am looking for a variant of the Implicit function theorem such that it guarantees the analyticity of the implicitly defined function, and works for a single branch of a curve around a singular point? What kind of such variants of the IFT are out there? Hopefully clarifying background. I was teaching a short course on series and their applications to sophomores last fall. In their last set of homework problems I had a question about the Folium of Descartes $$x^3+y^3=3xy.$$
I asked the students to find two first non-zero terms of the Taylor series of the branch $y=y(x)$ that obviously has a local minimum at $x=0$ (shown in thick red in the image below). My goals with this exercise were modest. Basically I wanted the students to do a minimum amount of work with the arithmetic of formal power series. I didn't ask them anything about convergence this time. We had not covered any tools for that (they were scheduled to take a first course in complex analysis only later). My crude thinking. The folium is a genus zero algebraic curve, and has the rational parametrization (coming from blowing up the singularity with $y=tx$)
$$x=\frac{3t}{1+t^3},\qquad y=\frac{3t^2}{1+t^3}.$$
The branch of interest is gotten by restricting $t$ to a suitable neigborhood of $t=0$ (when producing that image I used $t\in[-1/2,1/2]$). When viewed as complex variables, we can invert the $x=x(t)$ to a function $t=t(x)$ that is holomorphic in a neighborhood of $x=0$. Therefore it is represented by a convergent Taylor series. Consequently so is $y=tx$. But. This depends heavily on our ability to blow up the singularity allowing us to isolate the chosen branch. I am too ignorant to know for sure, but I suspect that we may need some structures from algebraic geometry to be able to even define a branch around the singular point in such a way that the IFT can be applied. My solution (if you can call it that) also depended on the genus. Having a rational parametrization made it easier. I'm aware of the existence of analytic parametrizations of some curves (like the formal group law parameter of an elliptic curve), but I'm ignorant about the more general results. So the main question may have evolved to. (feel free to discuss your favorite variants) Do we need the singularity to come from an algebraic equation to be able to discuss the branches, and study the analyticity of an individual branch? Is there a variant of the IFT that guarantees the analyticity of a single branch? Extra credit for students. (in case some students read my question up to this point, and want to work on something related) Show that in a solution $y=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$ to the equation
$x^3+y^3=3xy$ only every third term can be non-zero. More precisely, show that if $a_n\neq0$ then $n\equiv2\pmod3$. Edit: Thinking about this topic more (particularly in light of Cactus314's answer) it dawned on me that type of algebraic singularity makes a huge difference. When we work around a multiple point, with distinct tangents for each
branch, we can, like in the case of the Folium, work with any branch
as long as the corresponding tangent isn't vertical. But, when we have a cusp things can go wrong. Consider the textbook cusp that the curve $y^2=x^3$ has at the origin. No amount of resolving of the singularity is going to make either $y=x^{3/2}$ or $y=-x^{3/2}$ analytic! So my updated guess is that for this to work we need to able to isolate branch such that $x-x_0$ becomes a local parameter along that branch. Can we formulate this in a non-algebraic way?","['real-analysis', 'implicit-function-theorem', 'algebraic-geometry', 'complex-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

If $G=(5-X^{2})(4X^{4}-20X^{2}+25)$ , compute the singular points of $\mathcal{C}$ . Prove that $\mathcal{C}$ has a unique point at infinity and that this point is simple if and only if $d=3$ . Does the curve $\mathcal{C}$ have asymptotes? And I thought this, but I need some help: I know that the tangent lines are given by the form of lowest degree, which is $Y^2$ . Then $Y=0$ is a double tangent line. Must all singular points be in the same tangent line? We have that $(a,0)$ is singular if and only if it is a zero of $F$ , $\frac{\partial F}{\partial X}$ and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Y}$ . As $Y=0$ , then $F(a,0)=G(a)$ , $\frac{\partial F}{\partial X}(a,0)=G'(a)$ and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Y}(a,0)=0$ so it must be a multiple root of $G$ . Is this correct? I haven't do this yet, but I know the algorithm to do it. Let $G(X)=a_0 X^d + a_1 X^{d-1}+\cdots +a_d$ . We know that $P_\infty (\mathcal C)= \mathrm V (F^*, Z)$ , so we compute $$F^* = Y^2 Z^{d-2}-(a_0 X^d + a_1 X^{d-1}Z+\cdots +a_d Z^d)$$ If $Z=0$ , then $X=0$ , so $P_\infty (\mathcal C)=\mathrm V(F^*, Z)=\{P=(0:1:0)\}$ .

Does some version of Fubini's theorem still hold? If not, can we put more requirements on either $f$ or the measures to make it work for complex Borel measures?

2605197,Total degree of a product of polynomials,"Note: This is not a duplicate of this question . The accepted answer there gives some answer to my question here, but the question is not a duplicate... I'm currently brushing up on some algebra with ""Abstract Algebra"" by Grillet, Second Edition. We consider, for a unital Ring $R$ and a family of sets $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ the polynomial ring

$$
\max\left\{\sum_{i \in I} k_i;\, k\in I^\mathbb{N}\,,\, k_i = 0\, \text{ for almost all } i\, \land \, a_k \neq 0\right\}
$$ I generally put quite a lot of trust into textbooks as carefully written as this one, but the following statement on page 127 seems wrong to me and I am stuck trying to prove it: Proposition 6.4 . For all $A, B \neq 0$ in $R[(X_i)_{i\in I}]$: ... (4) if $R$ has no zero divisors, then $\deg(\,AB\,) = \deg A + \deg B$ What I have proven is $\deg(\,AB\,) \leq \deg A + \deg B$, which was part (3) of the proposition. However, part (4) baffles me. I started out expecting this to be easy but got stuck; and now I'm really a little too exhausted because I couldn't let go and kept on thinking about how to prove this. I'm actually wondering if this is actually wrong and was just a copy-paste error from the corresponding page 121 for the univariate case, where we have the exact same statement, safe for there only being one variable. A counterexample is probably not that hard, but I'm really too tired right now, and then I actually already got sidetracked just brushing up on basics required for my bachelor's thesis with this already, in the first place. Why I feel like this isn't right: For $k \in I^\mathbb{N}$ with finite support, the $k$-th coefficient of $AB$ is $$
(AB)_k = \sum_{(m,\,n) \in (I^\mathbb{N})^2;\,m + n = k} a_m b_n
$$ where the $a_i, b_i$ are the coefficients of $A$, respectively $B$. In the univariate case, the degree formula holds if $R$ has no zero divisors, because the leading coefficient of the product is the product of the leading coefficients. However, in the multivariate case, each coefficient can be a sum of products: Picking indices $\nu\,,\, \mu$ with $\sum_i \nu_i = \deg A$ and $\sum_i \mu_i = \deg B$, I don't see how $R$ having no zero divisors would lead to the coefficient
$$
(AB)_{\nu + \mu} = \sum_{(m,\,n) \in (I^\mathbb{N})^2;\,m + n = \nu + \mu} a_m b_n
$$
being nonzero,
although it seems obvious that $AB \neq 0$ if we look at the $i$-degree

2605457,Help resolving this contradiction in descriptions of the fundamental groups of the figure eight and n-torus,"I'm faced with a few contradictory statements: 1) This article on Wolfram MathWorld says that ""$\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}=\lbrace(n,m)\rbrace$ is a free abelian group of rank 2."" (I thought that this is the definition of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$.) 2) This article also on Wolfram MathWorld says that the fundamental group $\pi_1$ of the figure eight is ""$\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$"" and that the first homology group $H_1$ of the figure eight is ""$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$"", implying that these two groups are different, i.e., not isomorphic. This article also states the fundamental and first homology groups of a n-torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ are both ""$\mathbb{Z}^n$"" (which I thought usually refers to $\mathbb{Z}\times . . . \times\mathbb{Z}$   n times?). 3) This article also on Wolfram MathWorld states that the fundamental group of the figure 8 is the ""free group with two generators"" (i.e., is NOT the free abelian group of rank 2). 4) My textbook, Munkres , states in Section 60 that the fundamental group of the figure eight is not abelian and that the fundamental group of the two-holed torus (2-torus or $\mathbb{T}^2$) is not abelian. 5) This answer on math.stackexchange.com says that the fundamental group of the n-torus is $\langle{a_1}, b_1, ..., a_n, b_n \mid [a_1, b_1]...[a_n, b_n]=0 \rangle$, where $[a, b]=aba^{-1}b^{-1}$. 6) Section 60 of Munkres also states that the fundamental group of a 1-torus is $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, which is what I consider the free abelian group of rank 2 (correct me if I'm wrong). As a sanity check, I tested whether this is isomorphic to the group that results from statement (5) when $n=1$, and found that it is. The best way to resolve this contradiction seems to be to say that statement (1) was a typo and should have said the free abelian group of rank 2 is $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, NOT $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$. To fully resolve the contradiction I would then guess that $\mathbb{Z}^n$ in statement (2) is also a typo (since thisusually refers to $\mathbb{Z}\times . . . \times\mathbb{Z}$   n times), and should instead be $\langle{a_1}, b_1, ..., a_n, b_n \mid [a_1, b_1]...[a_n, b_n]=0 \rangle$, as in statement 5. Interpreting things this way, I would also guess that the notation $\mathbb{Z}* . . . *\mathbb{Z}$ refers to the free group with n generators (can someone at least verify whether this is true or not?). Does this resolution of the contradiction (which implies there are two flagrant typos in Wolfram MathWorld articles) seem correct?

\frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \to_D Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1).
$$ One commenter points out the Berry-Essen theorem which gives a bound on the CDF of $(\overline{X}_n - \mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ and the standard normal random variable based on the third absolute moment $\rho := \Bbb E[|X-\mu|^3]$. Specifically, if $F_n$ is the CDF of $(\overline{X}_n - \mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ and $\Phi$ of the standard normal random variable, then the theorem states that the difference between these is bounded as $$
|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)| \le \frac{C\rho}{\sigma^3\sqrt{n}}, \text{ for all } x \in \Bbb R, \text{ $C$ constant}.
$$ However, despite the existence of a concrete quantitative error bound on the approximation of $(\overline{X}_n - \mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$, introductory statistics classes often treat $(\overline{X}_n - \mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ as either unapproximable at all by a normal random variable or perfectly normal, with $n = 30$ as a seemingly arbitrary cutoff between the two. Presumably, whether a given sample should be approximated as normal depends highly on $\rho$ and $\sigma$, not just $n$. My questions: Why isn't the error in the normal approximation taken into account when performing statistical inference or making confidence intervals using the CLT? Does computing $$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \: s := \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2},
$$ and some unbiased consistent estimate $\hat{\rho}$ of $\rho$ and computing $C\hat{\rho}/s^3\sqrt{n}$ give a ""better"" heuristic for whether one should use a large sample CLT approximation than simply looking at $n\ge 30$?

For example, note that $f(x,y)=x^2+6xy+y^2$ can be rewritten in the form $f(x,y)=2(x+y)^2−(x−y)^2$. From this, we should expect that f has a saddle at zero if and only if g(x,y)=$2x^2−y^2$ has one as well.

$$
\sum_{k=x-c}^c\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{x-k}
$$
or equivalently if $c=n\lambda_1$ and $x=2n\lambda_2$, for constants $p\leq\lambda_2\leq\lambda_1<1$
$$
\sum_{k=2n\lambda_2-n\lambda_1}^{n\lambda_1}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{2n\lambda_2-k}
$$ I don't think I can just apply Stirling's approximations to the binomial coefficients individual and take the sum and product. EDIT Could someone comment if this is a valid attempt? Using @robjohn's solution in this post , let 
$$
a_k=\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{2n\lambda_2-k}
$$
Then letting $k=n\lambda_2+j$,
$$
\log\left(\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right)=-\frac{2j}{n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}+O(n^{-1})
$$
Thus,
$$
a_k=a_{n\lambda_2}\exp\left(-\frac{2j^2}{n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}+O(j/n)\right)
$$
Estimating 
$$
a_{n\lambda_2}\sim C(\lambda_2)=\frac{1}{2\pi n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}(1-\lambda_2)^{-2n}\left(\frac{1-\lambda_2}{\lambda_2}\right)^{2n\lambda_2}
$$
by Stirling's formula and using Riemann integral for the exponential,
$$
\sum_{j=-n(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)}^{n(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)}\exp\left(-\frac{2j^2}{n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}+O(j/n)\right)=\sqrt{n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-2t^2\right)dt(1+O(1/n))
$$
we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k=2n\lambda_2-n\lambda_1}^{n\lambda_1}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{2n\lambda_2-k}&\sim& C(\lambda_2)\sqrt{n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}\sqrt{\pi/2}\\
&=&\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2\pi n\lambda_2(1-\lambda_2)}}(1-\lambda_2)^{-2n}\left(\frac{1-\lambda_2}{\lambda_2}\right)^{2n\lambda_2}
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting back $c=n\lambda_1$ and $x=2n\lambda_2$, and noticing Stirling's formula for $\binom{2n}{x}$, we get
$$
\sum_{k=x-c}^c\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{x-k}\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\frac{2n}{2\pi x(2n-x)}}\left(\frac{2n}{2n-x}\right)^{2n}\left(\frac{2n-x}{x}\right)^x\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\binom{2n}{x}
$$
To me this is very interesting that it doesn't involve $c$, which disappeared when estimating with the Riemann integral above. However, after plugging in a couple of values in Mathematica, the approximation on the right hand side doesn't always give an accurate approximation to the partial sum. QUESTION 2 Is there a way to figure out how far this partial sum is from the upper bound of $\binom{2n}{x}$? EDIT 2 It turns out that 
$$
\sum_{k=x-c}^c\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{x-k}=\binom{2n}{x}-2\sum_{k=0}^{x-c-1}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{x-k}
$$ I guess, then I'm interested in showing if 
$$
2\sum_{k=0}^{x-c-1}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{x-k}=o\left(\binom{2n}{x}\right)

2606054,What is the Clifford/geometric product in terms of the inner and exterior product,"The geometric product is defined generally as the algebra on the space of multivectors $\bigwedge \Lambda(V)$ $$ab = a \cdot b + a \wedge b$$ with $\cdot$ a product on the vector space $V$ and $\wedge$ the exterior product. But how do those definitions extend to general multivectors? That is, for the multivectors \begin{eqnarray}
A_i \in \Lambda^i V,\ A &=& \sum_{i=0}^n a_i A_i\\
B_i \in \Lambda^i V,\ B &=& \sum_{i=0}^n b_i B_i
\end{eqnarray} What are the products $A \cdot B$ and $A \wedge B$? For the exterior product I'm guessing it will simply be $$A \wedge B = (\sum_{i=0}^n a_i A_i) \wedge (\sum_{j=0}^n b_j B_j)$$ since that is a well defined quantity, but in the case of the inner product, it seems a bit harder. From some books it seems to be something of the form of the sum over every combination of the basis contracting with each other, for instance, $$e_1 \cdot (e_2 \wedge e_3) = \frac 12 \left[(e_1 \cdot e_2) e_3 + (e_1 \cdot e_3) e_2 \right]$$ which maps $n$-blades to $(n-1)$-blades, with the appropriate generalization for inhomogeneous multivectors and arbitrary $n$-blades, although I'm not sure how the inner product of two $2$-blades work, either, or what happens in the case of $0$-forms, is it simply the product in this case? Is this the correct product, and in particular, is there a definition of it that is independant of the choice of basis?","['clifford-algebras', 'abstract-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"
2606058,Why does birational equivalence preserve group law in elliptic curves?,"In the first chapter of ""Rational points on Elliptic curves"", Silverman, page 24 writes The transformations we used to put the curve in normalized form do not map straight lines to straight lines. Since we defined the group law on our curve using lines connecting points, it is not at all clear that our transformation preserves the structure of the group. (That is, is our trans- transformation a homomorphism?) It is, but that is not at all obvious. The point is that our description of addition of points on the curve is not a good one, because it seems to depend on the way the curve is embedded in the plane. But in fact the addition law is an intrinsic operation which can be described on the curve and is invariant under birational  transformation. This follows from basic facts about algebraic curves, but is not so easy (virtually impossible?) to prove simply by manipulating the explicit equations. This seems really important and really surprising (at least to me)! Is this addressed later on in the book?

2606095,Effect of adding a zero row and column on the eigenvalues of a matrix,"Suppose I have a matrix, and for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$, I insert a row of zeros between the $n$th and $n+1$th rows, and a column of zeroes between the $n$th and $n+1$the columns. For example, for $n=1$ and the matrix:

In general, what effect does this have on the eigenvalues?

From this, and playing around with some matrices, I believe the following: If $A$ is a singular matrix, then the eigenvalues of $B$ are the same as the eigenvalues of $A$. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then the eigenvalues of $B$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ as well as 0.

Hence, for the example in 1. the space $(E, \mathcal{E})$ must be necessarily not Borel. If possible, I would like to see in both cases also examples where $\mathcal{E}$ is still ""nice enough"" and not too pathological (e.g. contains all singleton sets and is countably generated).

But the right-hand side may not be defined since $\{ X_s = x \}$ need not be measurable (independent of whether $\{ x \}$ is contained in $\mathcal{E}$ or not) and if it is measurable then $P(X_s = x) = 0$ is possible.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory']"

  where $(\gamma^{\alpha\beta})=(\gamma_{\alpha\beta})^{-1}$. On the other hand, by Nash embedding theorem, we can view $N$ as an isometrically embedded submanifold of $\Bbb R^K$ some large $K$. In this case, we may define harmonicity as follow. Extrinsic definition : $u$ is said to be harmonic if
  $$\begin{align}
\Delta u =& A(u)(\nabla u,\nabla u)  \\
:=& \sum_{\alpha=1}^m A(u)(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^{\alpha}},\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^{\alpha}})

Here are some of my questions: -In both cases, $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator right? -For the extrinsic definition, is $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^{\alpha}}$ just the usual $(\frac{\partial u^1}{\partial x^{\alpha}},\dots,\frac{\partial u^K}{\partial x^{\alpha}})\in \Bbb R^K$? -How do we show that both expressions are equivalent? PS. My background is mostly in analysis (in Euclidean spaces) with some basic knowledge of Riemannian geometry and differential geometry.

2606566,Using averages to measure the dispersion of data,"INTRODUCTION: I recently had a new idea on how to measure the dispersion of data. Since I have done my quick research and have not been able to find this method anywhere I was curious to see what somebody with greater expertise in the field of statistics would think about it and so I am sharing it here as a first step. During my engineering education I have been taught several ways to analyze the dispersion of data, the most popular being the standard deviation, where a lot of the probability and statistics theory is based on. In some other applications however, I have been exposed to methods such as the range, both of the MAD's or even the IQR. I even did my own literature study regarding the suitability of each of these methods, and it is clear to me that while the standard deviation is the most widely used method, it is not the only method nor always the most suitable one. IDEA: To my idea: The result of this method actually looks a lot like the box and whiskers plot you would get from using the IQR (Inter quartile range) method. Instead of relying though on percentiles, it relies on averages. Here the method outline: Calculate the mean: This is a very common step, since most methods out there require this value in order to be able to calculate the dispersion of the data from the expected value. Calculate the mean for left and right sides: We just calculated the mean, which for a function represents the centroid of a distribution. This center line is used usually as a reference for how far away a data point is in terms of dispersion. So why do we not split the data here, and take again the averages, but this time only for each half, left and right? That is actually what I then do. Results: We now have a mid-average (mq), a lower quarter average (lq) and a upper quarter average (uq). Obviously from this we can then also calculate the IQR as:
\begin{equation}
\text{IQR} = \text{uq} - \text{lq}
\end{equation} 
Obviously this gives a good idea on how the data is distributed. Not only can we say something about its distribution through the IQR, but we can analyze the symmetry by checking the difference between the $(\text{uq} - \text{mq})$ and $(\text{mq} - \text{lq})$. I hope I am also right in saying that the IQR (for a normal distribution) represents 50% of the data, and if we would want to use more data, we would simply have to repeat the 'split and calculate new average' method (in which the next iteration would include 75% of the data). So, what do you guys think about this method? Maybe you could also tell how one would go about testing the method? OWN THOUGHTS: As far as I can see, the method relies on averages, which is quite nice. Unlike the percentiles used for the typical IQR method, averages rely on the whole data. This might not make them very robust, but are always adjusted  fully to the data. In addition, I find this quite an intuitive method; it's simple and the dispersion measured by 50% of the data seems easy to grasp. Finally, compared to the standard deviation, the values do not need to be squared, which means that this method does not get skewed as much by outliers and may be more fitting when analyzing data with errors. (The reason the mean absolute deviation (MAD or MD) is sometimes used.) EXAMPLE: In order to give an idea how this would look like, two examples, one in which the numerical process is shown, another of a comparison between the box and whiskers (without the whiskers) results from the typical IQR method and the method I propose here. Example 1: Say we start off with the following data: 2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7,8,10 From this we can calculate the mid-average: 
\begin{equation}
\text{mq} = \frac{2+4+\cdots+10}{10} = 5.6 
\end{equation} 
All the values lower than or equal to 5.6 are taken and the lq is calculated with the same average formula:
\begin{equation}
\text{lq} = \frac{2+4+\cdots+5}{5} = 3.8 
\end{equation} 
We can repeat this method to calculate the uq, this time for all the values bigger or equal to 5.6:
\begin{equation}
\text{lq} = \frac{6+6+\cdots+10}{5} = 7.4 
\end{equation} 
We therefore can calculate the IQR using these average values:
\begin{equation}
\text{IQR} = \text{uq} - \text{lq} = 3.6
\end{equation}
In addition, we can observe that when taking the ratio between $(\text{uq} - \text{mq})$ and $(\text{mq} - \text{lq})$, we get a value of 1.0, suggesting that the data is symmetric. Example 2: Here the figure I have obtained using a Python code (posted below) which compares the typical IQR method with the method outlined here. You can see in green the mq, lq and uq for the typical IQR method, in red the result of the method I have been proposing. The sample size is 1000, and the values for the lines are: My method: mid_avg:  -0.0905134149804 lq_avg:  -1.63815314319 uq_avg: 1.50107551444 IQRwAVG:  3.13922865764 Typical IQR method: median:  -0.116056069599 25 percentile:  -1.39684011872 50 percentile:  1.21390120378 IQR:  2.6107413225 Here the code: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

2606575,Contractible balls implies contractible space?,"Suppose you have a metric space $(X,d)$ and a point $x\in X$ such that every ball of finite radius $B(x;r)$ is contractible. Then is $X$ itself contractible? Edit : I've been asked to provide context for this question, to save it from being closed. Well, the question just occurred to me out of the blue with no particular application in mind (although generally speaking I'm not interested in anything more exotic than a CW-complex). It seems to me a naturally interesting question whether contractibility of finite balls implies anything about the contractibility of a potentially infinite space $X$. Certainly when $X$ is a finite metric space the answer is yes. And a little thought shows that the converse statement is false in general. So what remained was to understand the case of infinite metric spaces, and Qiaochu's answer below provides the answer for (spaces with homotopy type of) CW-complexes, which is good enough for me. (As for the ""level"" of the question being asked, the fact that I accepted the answer should indicate something about that.)","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

  $$y'=ay+g(x)$$
  where $a>0$ is a constant and $h,g : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ smooth functions, does not have any periodic solutions. Hint : Apply Bendixson's criteria. Discussion/Question : First of all, the exercise refers to Bendixson's Criteria but on our notes and previous lessons, we have explored two different theorems/criteria involving Bendixson : Poincare-Bendixson Theorem : Given a differentiable real dynamical system defined on an open subset of the plane, then every non-empty compact ω-limit set of an orbit, which contains only finitely many fixed points, is either : a fixed point, a periodic orbit, or a connected set composed of a finite number of fixed points together with homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits connecting these. Moreover, there is at most one orbit connecting different fixed points in the same direction. However, there could be countably many homoclinic orbits connecting one fixed point. Bendixson-Dulac Theorem : Ιf there exists a $C^{1}$ function ${\displaystyle \varphi (x,y)}$ (called the Dulac function) such that the expression :
  $$\frac{\partial φf}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial φg}{\partial y}$$
  has the same sign $( \neq 0)$ almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system :
  $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,y)$$
  $$\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x,y)$$
  has no nonconstant periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.""Almost everywhere"" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line. I wanted to clarify which of the $2$ criteria/theorems is implied to be used by the phrased used as a hint given by the exercise, as it is not clear enough. In my opinion, I think it refers to the Bendixson - Dulac one, since it's the one regarding the non-existence (point of the exercise as well). Would the first one though lead to something that won't hold with the hypothesis that a periodic orbit exists ? Now, applying the Bendixson-Dulac Theorem : First of all, we're given that $h,g : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ are smooth functions, which means that they indeed $h,g \in C^1(\mathbb R)$. Then, for  $φ(x,y) = 1 \in C^1(\mathbb R^2)$, we have : $$\frac{\partial φf}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial φg}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial h(y) }{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (ay + g(x))}{\partial y} = a> 0$$ since $h(y)$ is a function of $y$ and $g(x)$ a function of $x$. Then, since the expression required sustains the same sign everywhere, from the Bendixson-Dulac Theorem there exists none periodic solutions to the given system of differential equations. So, is my approach correct ? Would be letting $φ(x,y) = 1$ be correct ? It seems trivial in such case, still not sure about what exactly the hint wants us to use.","['stability-in-odes', 'periodic-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

and is zero otherwise; $\,$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\quad$M$_{ij}$= $\min(i,j)$ for $1 \leq i , j \leq n$ .  It is straightforward to check that $M = L^2$ .  For example, when $n=3$ we have $\qquad$ $\qquad$ $\qquad$$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\1 & 2 & 2\\1 & 2 & 3\\ \end{bmatrix}$ = 
$\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 1 & 1\\1 & 1 & 1\\ \end{bmatrix}^2$ . [Remarks: $\det(M) = 1$ ; $M$ is positive definite but $L$ is not  ; the eigenvalues of $M$ are distinct ( to see this, it's easier to work with $M^{-1}$ which is tridiagonal ). ] General theory then predicts that $L$ can be written as a polynomial in $M$. A priori , this polynomial might be expected to have algebraic numbers as coefficients, but the examples below suggest that the situation may be nicer than that. First, when $n=2$ we find by inspection that  $L = M - I.$ Next, for $n=3$, a calculation shows that $L = M^2 - 5M + 2I$. And yet again for $n=4$, we 
find $L = 2M^3 - 19M^2 + 21M - 5I.$ In each case (so far) the polynomial turned out to have integral coefficients. Questions: (1) Is it always true, for arbitrary $n$ , that $L$ can be expressed as a polynomial in $M$ with integral coefficients? (2) Presumably, matrices like $M$ above which have an integral square root are
the exception rather than the rule.  Is it easy to show that almost all ( in any suitable sense) matrices in $\text{SL}(n,Z)$ do not possess a square root in $\text{GL}(n,Z)$ whenever $n \geq 2$ ?","['matrices', 'number-theory']"

2606950,Finding statistical data for repeated surveys in a population,"I came across this statistical problem: in a population of 223 people, repeated surveys are carried out by different groups. The first group will randomly choose 40 people to survey, and the second group will randomly choose 40 people to survey, and so on. Each group will choose independently of each other. There are 16 total groups, with 14 of them choosing 40 people, 1 of them choosing 50 people, and 1 of them choosing 60 people. Questions: Can this situation be related to an existing and well-studied type of problem? What is the average amount of surveys each individual will get? What is the standard deviation? What is the expected (average) amount of people that receives 0, 1, 2, 3...16 surveys? If we suspect some groups did not carry out the amount of surveys they are supposed to (e.g. all groups only did a-half of the surveys they claimed to) and so we collected a sample in the population, what should we find in order to conclude that some groups did not survey the amount they claimed. I found some of these questions quite simple, while some are quite complicated. The mean is easily solvable: $\frac{40*14+50+60}{223}$ When it comes to the standard deviation, the first thing I thought of is to calculate each possible scenario. Using a simple example: 3 groups chose 3, 4, and 7 people from a population of 8. The pictures showed calculations by hand. It became quite apparent that the number of cases grow at a fast rate (perhaps an exponential growth), so I wrote a program that did the calculations. Unfortunately, though I tried to perform multiple optimizations, including ignoring cases that has a low probability of occurring and tracking only people that received 0 and 1 surveys, the calculation still took half an hour. The result is: Expected values: People with 0 surveys: 7.94284 People with 1 survey: 29.52534 People with 2 surveys and above: 185.53182 When I try to increase the amount of surveys counted, it seems to take forever when calculating group 8 or so. The brute-force method of finding every case (or, with optimizations, probable cases), therefore, failed to get an answer due to the amount of calculations needed. But, I found out that the expected values displayed a pattern. Though I have no ironclad proof, for smaller testing samples, the pattern matches the brute-force method perfectly. Here is an example. Selecting from a population of 8. The expected (average) amount of people getting n surveys after selecting m people = (amount of people getting n surveys before this selection) * [(n-m) / n)] + (amount of people getting n - 1 surveys before this selection) * (m / n). In other words, expected survey count = amount of people remaining in this count due to not getting selected + amount of people promoted from (count - 1) due to getting selected. The computation is still quite tedious, so I wrote a program and an Excel spreadsheet that calculates it. The formula is shown on the top of the picture. The program is more flexible and have more options in accuracy, so here is the rounded result of the program. Mean: 3.0044843049 Standard Deviation: 2.4423302226 Expected surveys received: 0 surveys: 7.9428 people 1 survey: 29.525 people 2 surveys: 51.350 people 3 surveys: 55.471 people 4 surveys: 41.663 5 surveys: 23.072 6 surveys: 9.7455 7 surveys: 3.2032 8 surveys: 0.82802 9 surveys: 0.16891 10 surveys: 0.027101 11 surveys: 0.0033846 12 surveys: 0.00032254 13 surveys: 0.000022674 14 surveys: 0.0000011090 15 surveys: 3.3720E-8 16 surveys: 4.8016E-10 Now answering the fifth question (suspecting groups making less surveys than claimed), according to the Central Limit Theorem, the mean of the sample distribution is equal to the mean of the population, and the standard deviation is $\sigma_\bar{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. So after the sample is taken (not violating the 10% rule), we can plug the value of n in an see if the sample mean is 2$\sigma$ away from the expected mean. If it is more than 2$\sigma$ away, we have sufficient reason to doubt the integrity of the sampling groups. We can probably also look at whether the sample survey counts match the population expected survey counts, but I don't know how this comparison can lead to any conclusion. So, my final questions now became: Can this situation be related to any existing problems that are well-studied? Are all my calculations and methodologies correct? Especially, is the formula for making inferences about expected count correct? If so, what is the proof? Are there any formula that can calculate the expected survey counts faster? Can I infer anything from the comparison between expected survey counts and sample survey counts?

2607060,"Proof check - If two sequences A and B are equivalent, then the first one is a Cauchy sequence if and only if the second one is a Cauchy sequence too","Could someone check this proof? Definitions : Equivalence : Two sequences are equivalent iff, for any $\varepsilon > 0$,there exists an $N$ such that for $n \geq N$, $|a_n - b_n| < \varepsilon$. Cauchy Sequence : $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$  is a Cauchy sequence iff, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that $j,k \geq N$ implies $|a_j - a_k| < \varepsilon$. Proposition : Show that, if two sequences $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$  and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are equivalent, then $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence if and only if $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence too. Proof : Let $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$  and $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$  be equivalent and assume $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence. As both sequences are equivalent, for some n and for any $\varepsilon$ , we have $$|a_n - b_n| + | b_{n+1} - a_{n+1}| + |a_{n+1} - a_n | < \varepsilon$$ By the triangle inequality theorem, $$|a_n - b_n + b_{n+1} - a_{n+1} + a_{n+1} - a_n|  =  |b_{n+1} - b_n| <\varepsilon $$ We could show that, if  $(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence, then $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence too, by a reciprocal argument. $\blacksquare$","['real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences', 'proof-verification']"
2607077,Willmore energy of revolution torus,"I would like to know if it is possible to prove the Willmore Conjecture over the particular case of a revolution torus having the knowledge of a first course in differential geometry. Suppose $0 < r < a$ and let $T(a,r)$ be a revolution torus made by rotating over the Z axis the circumference $\mathbb{S}^1(a,r)$ in the plane $\{y = 0\}$. There is an almost everywhere parameterization $X\colon ]0,2\pi[\times ]0,2\pi[ \to \mathbb{R}^3$, given by $$ X(u,v) = ((a+r\cos u)\cos v, (a + r \cos u) \sin v, r \sin u). $$ So, the Willmore energy over $T(a,r)$ will be given by the expression $$ \int_{T(a,r)}H^2 = \int_{]0,2\pi[\times ]0,2\pi[}(H^2 \circ X) |X_u \wedge X_v|, $$ where $H$ is the mean curvature function. We can calculate the coefficientes of the first fundamental form.
$$ E(u,v) = |X_u|^2 = r^2 $$
$$ F(u,v) = \langle X_u, X_v \rangle = 0 $$
$$ G(u,v) = |X_v|^2 = (a + r\cos u)^2 $$ We call $\alpha(u,v) = \sqrt{EG-F^2}(u,v) = r(a+r\cos u)$. We can then calculate the coefficients of second fundamental form. $$e(u,v) = \frac{1}{\alpha}\det(X_u,X_v,X_{uu})(u,v) = r$$
$$f(u,v) = \frac{1}{\alpha}\det(X_u,X_v,X_{uv})(u,v) = 0$$
$$g(u,v) = \frac{1}{\alpha}\det(X_u,X_v,X_{vv})(u,v) = \cos u(a + r\cos u).$$ We have then,
$$ (H \circ X)(u,v) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{eG+gE-2fF}{EG-F^2}(u,v) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{r(a+r\cos u)^2+r^2\cos u (a + r \cos u)}{r^2 (a + r \cos u)^2} = \frac{a+2r\cos u}{r(a+r\cos u)}. $$ Since $(H^2 \circ X) = (H \circ X)^2$ and $|X_u \wedge X_v|^2 = |X_u|^2 |X_v|^2 - \langle X_u,X_v \rangle^2 = EG - F^2$, and then $|X_u \wedge X_v| = \alpha$, we finally obtain $$ \int_{T(a,r)} H^2 = \int_{]0,2\pi[\times]0,2\pi[} \frac{(a + 2r\cos u)^2}{r(a+r\cos u)} d(u,v) = \frac{2\pi}{r}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{(a + 2r\cos u)^2}{a+r\cos u} du  .$$ I'm stuck at this point. I have tried the change $u = 2 \arctan t$, but I haven't been able to compute that integral. Is this way right to calculate Willmore energy for this kind of torus? If so, how can I continue?

2607121,Linearity of pushforward of tangent vectors and differentiability,"Let $f:U\to V$ be a continuous map of open subsets of Euclidean spaces $U\subset\mathbb R^m,V\subset\mathbb R^n$.
