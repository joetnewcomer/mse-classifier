329022,Showing that the McCarthy Function is a well-defined function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers,"For those of you who aren't familiar, the McCarthy Function states that $M(n) = n − 10$ if $n > 100$ and $M(M(n + 11))$ if $n \leq 100$ (a recursive function). I'm trying to prove that this function is a well-defined function from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers, and I'm starting off by proving that $M(n) = 91$ for all positive integers $n$ with $n \leq 101$.  Here's how I approached the proof: For $90 \leq n < 101$, $$\begin{array}{rl} M(n) &= M(M(n + 11))\\
&= M(n + 11 - 10), \, \text{where}\, n + 11 \geq 101\,\, \text{since}\, \, n \geq 90 \\
&= M(n + 1)\end{array}$$ So $M(n) = 91$ for $90 ≤ n < 101$. We can use this as a base case for induction on blocks of $11$ numbers, like so: Assume that $M(n) = 91$ for $a ≤ n < a + 11$. Then, for any $n$ such that $a - 11 ≤ n < a$, $$\begin{array}{rl} M(n) &= M(M(n + 11))\\
&= M(91), \text{ by hypothesis, since } a ≤ n + 11 < a + 11 \\
&= 91, \text{ by the base case}.
\end{array}$$ Now by induction $M(n) = 91$ for any $n$ in such a block. There are no holes between the blocks, so $M(n) = 91$ for $n < 101$. We can also add $n = 101$ as a special case. Do you think this is sufficient for the proof or would there be any other steps you'd recommend I take?  Thanks!","['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing']"

Going by wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnik%27s_theorem ) the best current result is $O(n^{5.2})$ which means that $O(n^{4.2})$ primality tests would be needed to find $q_2$ in the worst case.

My Work To prove we have to check two things: $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under $\circ$ $\circ$ is associative on $\mathbb{Z}$ For the first one, since we are only adding, subtractive and multiplying integers, the results will always be integers. Hence $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under $\circ$. For the second, I just have to show that $(x\circ y) \circ z =x\circ(y\circ z)$. RHS: $(x\circ y) \circ z =(x+y-xy)\circ z= x+y-xy+z-zx-zy+xyz$ LHS: $x\circ(y\circ z)=x\circ (y+z-yz)=x +y-xy+z-zx-zy+xyz$ Hence RHS$=$LHS. Therefore $(\mathbb{Z},\circ)$ is a semigroup.

329224,"A lawn, a flower, a pipe and the neighbours","You have a square lawn and a precious flower in the centre. You want to make sure you water the flower, and you don't particularly care how much of the lawn you water. To please your aleatory aesthetic sense, you uniformly randomly pick two points on the lawn as end points of an elevated irrigation pipe, which will rotate around its centre and irrigate the circle it covers. You keep picking points until the pipe waters the flower and none of the neighbours' plots. What's the probability for one pick to yield admissible points? Suppose your costs are mainly determined by the material for the pipe; what is its expected length? Suppose your costs are mainly determined by the water used; what's the expected irrigated area? How do these compare to the corresponding values if you just picked two random points without worrying about the flower or the neighbours? The background to this question is that I realized in thinking about this answer that a) calculations can actually be simplified by seemingly complicated conditions like the circle determined by the points being inside the square (the expected length of the segment is easier to determine with that condition than without), and b) some conditions, like the circle being inside the square, reduce the expected length and area, whereas others, like the centre being inside the circle, increase the expected length and area, and it would be interesting to see which of these effects is stronger. I'm hoping that perhaps it's different for the length and the area. Feel free to calculate higher moments. I expect this to be a straightforward calculation with the approach I used in that answer; it's just that the integration limits are slightly complicated by the condition that the centre be in the circle. I'll try to perform the calculation and write an answer if noone else does, but I thought I'd share the problem with you first.","['geometric-probability', 'probability']"

Does there exist an increasing sequence of $k$-times continuously differentiable functions $(g_n)_n \subset C^k(\mathbb{R}^d ; [0,\infty))$ that converges pointwise to $f$, i.e. $g_n(x) \leq g_{n+1}(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ as well as $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} g_n(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$?

329328,Smooth dependence of diagonalization,"I guess the following question refers to a standard result, but I cannot find a good reference or figure out the details. Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is symmetric and positive definite and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is self-adjoint with respect to $S$, i.e. $A^T S = S A$. Then it follows from basic linear algebra that there exists a decomposition

329342,What exactly is a Kähler Manifold?,"Please scroll down to the bold subheaded section called Exact questions if you are too bored to read through the whole thing. I am a physics undergrad, trying to carry out some research work on topological solitons. I have been trying to read a paper that uses Kähler Manifolds. My guide just expects me to learn the mathematical definitions, without understanding it(or he expects me to study complex manifolds by scratch by myself), within 3-4 days, with exams going on, but I find this highly discomforting. So, it would be great if someone could tell me what is a Kähler manifold, highlighting the essential features of the definition and what they do, and intuitive explanations behind each. Why are they mathematically important? Also, some reasons as to why they are used in Physics? The definition on Wikipedia is very obscure, linking you to 7-8 pages, and you forget what you are actually looking for. I have read the following definition from Nakahara: A Kähler Manifold is an hermitian manifold, whose Kälher form is closed i.e. $d\Omega=0$. After searching the internet, I know the following: A Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold equipped with a metric $g$,
  such that $g_p(X,Y)=g_p(J_pX,J_p Y)$, where $p \in M$ and $X,Y \in
 T_pM$ Again the web tells me that, $J$ is a linear map between the tangent spaces at a point such that $J^2=-1$. Lastly, the Kähler form $\Omega$ is a tensor field whose action is given by $\Omega_p(X,Y)=(J_pX,Y)$. Exact questions: This is what I would really really want to understand. What is the meaning and motivation for $J^2=-1$? What is the intuitive meaning and motivation for the definition of the Hermitian manifold, and the Kähler form? Most importantly, what does the Kähler form is closed really mean? I am sorry for the long question, and would be delighted, even if I got a partial answer. Looking forward for the replies. I am not looking for exact arguments, but an intuitive overall picture. Background: I understand definitions of real manifolds, tangent spaces, and a differential forms.

329457,Minimum number of points to beat the drop in the English Premier League?,"There are 20 teams in the English Premier League (EPL) and each team plays 2 games against any other team (one at home and one as a guest). A win is rewarded with 3 points, a draw is 1 point and loss is 0 points. At the end of the season the bottom 3 teams are relegated (and replaced with the best performing 3 teams from the lower level). There is a popular believe in the EPL, that you need to collect 40 points to avoid relegation. I want to find out: what is the real number of points which guarantee that you stay up; or if this is too hard are 40 points really enough? P.S. If two teams have equal number of points at the end of the season, other criteria take place, like better goal difference, away goal, etc. This means, that if the 17th and 18th team have the same number of points, it's not a guarantee by itself. Here is how far I got so far: The number of games per season are 380. Each game can have one of 3 outcomes: win for the hosts, win for the guests, or a draw. Which means, that there are $3^{380}$ possible tables at the end of the season. Of course, a lot of these are really duplicates: for example if t1 wins at home against t2 and looses away, is the same (for the final table) as if they lost at home and won away. Also, ""renaming"" the teams (e.g. $t_1$ becomes $t_2$, $t_2$ becomes $t_3$, $t_3$ becomes $t_1$) would produce the same table (for our problem). That is, it doesn't matter (for us) if t1 finishes first or is relegated, only the points of the first team, the second team, etc. We don't even care about the points of the first 16 teams, we only care about the points of the 17th and 18th places. But I don't know how to use these features to make sure we don't get any duplicates. So, how can I find that out? P.S. If I can reduce the number of possible tables to something which a computer can process, (and a way to construct them of course), this would be fine. [EDIT]
I just realized, that there's an easy way to prove that 40 points aren't enough: If each team win their home games (and thus looses it's away games), they all have 19*3 = 57 points at the end of the season. So even 57 points aren't enough to guarantee the 17th place.",['combinatorics']
329480,How many isomorphisms between two abelian groups,"I'm trying to work out how many isomorphisms there are from $V_4$ (Klein-4) to $C_2 \times C_2$ (2nd cyclic group) Firstly, I've already shown they are indeed isomorphic and clearly there are $4!$ bijections from $V_4$ to $C_2 \times C_2$, however only $4!/4 = 6$ of these map the identity to the identity, so there are at most $6$ isomorphisms from $V_4$ to $C_2 \times C_2$. Now, I'm slightly confused at this point, mostly because both are abelian. The map I used to show they are isomorphic I 'constucted' by comparing the Cayley tables of both, and showing they are 'in essence' exactly the same, and I mapped element to element in the order they appeared on the Cayley table. My confusion comes in because I'm not sure of the consequences of mapping the non-identity elements differently, so ultimately don't really know whether there are $6$ isomorphisms or just $1$. Having said that, I did map the non-identity elements differently and saw that it's still an isomorphism, that is $\phi (g_1 g_2) = \phi (g_1) \phi(g_2)$ for $g_1, g_2 \in V_4$.

If $\{g_{i}\}$ is just the constant functions (which are always continuous) then we can give $Y$ the indiscrete topology and give $X$ any topology and the result follows.

I just wanted to run a couple of simple questions past SE to check my reasoning is correct etc. Find a permutation $\alpha \in S_7$ such that $\alpha^4 = (2143567)$ Since any permutation can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles, $\alpha$ cannot be comprised of any disjoint transpositions as then $\alpha^4$ maps the elements of the transposition back to itself. $\alpha$ cannot have any disjoint $3$-cycles, $p_i$ as then $p_i^4 = p_i$. We can argue like this to see that $\alpha$ must be a $7$-cycle. So since $\alpha^4 = (2143567)$ in $\alpha$ there are three other elements between the consecutive elements in $\alpha^4$. So between elements $2$ and $1$ in $\alpha$ there are $3$ other elements, between $1 $ and $4$ in $\alpha$ there are $3$ other elements, there is only one such permutation and $\alpha = (1362457)$ Clearly we could write $\alpha = (3624571)$, which satisfies the condition above, but this is the identical permutation. Therefore, $\alpha = (1362457)$ and is unique. Find all permutation $\alpha \in S_7$ such that $\alpha^3 = (1234)$ Clearly, there is more than one such permutation as $\alpha$ could be a $4$-cycle with elements $1,2,3,4$ or $\alpha$ could be a $4$-cycle of elements $1,2,3,4$ and a $3$-cycle of elements $5,6,7$. $\alpha$ cannot be a product of any disjoint transpositions as $(ij)^3 = (ij)$. Also $\alpha$ cannot have any disjoint $k$-cycles where $k\geq4$ as there would be the same length cycle in $\alpha^3$. So one possible permutation is $\alpha_1 = (1432)$ There are no other possible permutations comprised of just one $4$-cycle for reasons discussed in the previous question. Now, there are $2$ possible ways to arrange the elements $5,6,7$ in a $3$-cycle, $(567)$ and $(576)$ so two further permutations are $\alpha_2 = (1432)(567)$ and $\alpha_3 = (1432)(576)$ In total there are $3$ permutations that satisfy $\alpha^3 = (1234)$ If there are any errors with this, or if there is a better method to exhaust possibilities, I'd appreciate your input.

329696,Can this product be written so that symmetry is manifest?,"Let $i,$ $j,$ $k$ be nonnegative integers such that $i+j+k$ is even.  The expression
$$(-1)^{j+k}\binom{i+j+k}{i,j,k}\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}$$
apparently computes the coefficients of certain terms in the expansion of a certain polynomial.  (My answer to this question provides motivation.  Incidentally, that question has an imminently-expiring bounty and deserves more attention - certainly something better than my own poor contribution.)  It can be shown - see below - that this expression is invariant under permutation of $i,$ $j,$ $k.$  My question is, is there a natural way of rewriting the expression so that this symmetry is more apparent?  Since the multinomial coefficient is manifestly symmetric, the main focus is on the remaining factors,
$$g(i,j,k):=(-1)^{j+k}\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}.$$
If $g(i,j,k)$ equals, or is closely related to some named object, that would be very interesting to me as well. The restriction that $i+j+k$ be even is necessary: in the case $i+j+k$ odd, $g(i,j,k)$ is, in fact, indeterminate for $k>i,j$; the sign is also changed by certain permutations in that case. Some thoughts: We can express $g(i,j,k)$ in terms of generalized binomial coefficients as
$$g(i,j,k)=(-1)^{j+k}\frac{\binom{\frac{1}{2}(i-j+k-1)}{k}}{\binom{\frac{1}{2}(i+j+k-1)}{k}}=(-1)^j\frac{\binom{\frac{1}{2}(-i+j+k-1)}{k}}{\binom{\frac{1}{2}(i+j+k-1)}{k}},$$
but this does not seem helpful. To prove the symmetry it suffices to show that $g(i,j,k)=g(j,i,k)=g(k,j,i)$ since these two permutations generate the full permutation group.  The first equality is proved as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}g(j,i,k)&=(-1)^{i+k}\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \frac{-i+j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}\\
&=(-1)^{i+k}\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \frac{-i+j-k+2\ell+1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}\\
&=(-1)^i\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-1} \frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}\\&=g(i,j,k).\end{aligned}$$
The second line is obtained from the first by substituting $k-1-\ell$ for $\ell$ in the numerator; the last line follows since $(-1)^i=(-1)^{j+k}$ by the assumption $i+j+k$ even. Equality of $g(i,j,k)$ and $g(k,j,i)$ is proved by taking $k\ge i$.  We have
$$\begin{aligned}1&=\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-i-1}\frac{i-j-k+2\ell+1}{i-j-k+2\ell+1}\\
&=\prod_{\ell=0}^{k-i-1}\frac{-i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i-j-k+2\ell+1}\\
&=\prod_{\ell=i}^{k-1}\frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{-i-j-k+2\ell+1}\\
&=(-1)^{k-i}\prod_{\ell=i}^{k-1}\frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}.\end{aligned}$$
The second line is obtained by substituting $k-i-1-\ell$ for $\ell$ in the numerator; the third is obtained by substituting $\ell-i$ for $\ell$ in both numerator and denominator.  Then
$$\begin{aligned}g(k,j,i)&=(-1)^{i+j}\prod_{\ell=0}^{i-1} \frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}\\
&=(-1)^{i+j}\prod_{\ell=0}^{i-1} \frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}(-1)^{k-i}\prod_{\ell=i}^{k-1}\frac{i-j+k-2\ell-1}{i+j+k-2\ell-1}\\
&=g(i,j,k).\\

329724,Solve $x=y\frac{dy}{dx}-\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}$,"I've recently been learning about differential equations, and my teacher has been giving some particularly difficult examples out for those of us who finish early. He gave us the following differential equation:
$$x=y\frac{dy}{dx}-\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}$$
With the hint ""Differentiate with respect to $y$, then let $\frac{dy}{dx}=p$"". I've solved it after the lesson and would like someone to check whether or not I've done so correctly. Following the hint, $$\frac{dx}{dy}=\frac{1}{p}=p+y\frac{dp}{dy}-2p\frac{dp}{dy}$$
Which rearranges to $$p-\frac{1}{p}+y\frac{dp}{dy}=2p\frac{dp}{dy}$$
Multiplying through by $\frac{dy}{dp}$,
$$\left(p-\frac{1}{p}\right)\frac{dy}{dp}+y=2p$$
Rearranging into the form $\frac{dy}{dp}+f(p)y=g(p)$, and writing $p-\frac{1}{p}=\frac{p^{2}-1}{p}$
$$\frac{dy}{dp}+\frac{p}{p^{2}-1}y=\frac{2p^{2}}{p^{2}-1}$$
Our integrating factor is $$e^{\int\frac{p}{p^{2}-1}dp}=e^{\frac{1}{2}\ln(p^{2}-1)}=\sqrt{p^{2}-1}$$
So we have
$$\sqrt{p^{2}-1}\frac{dy}{dp}+\frac{p}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}y=\frac{2p^{2}}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}$$
The left hand side is, by design, $\frac{d}{dp}(y\sqrt{p^{2}-1})$, and the right hand side can be integrated as follows:
$$\int \frac{2p^{2}}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}dp=\int\frac{2(p^{2}-1)+2}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}dp=\int 2\sqrt{p^{2}-1}dp+\int \frac{2}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}} dp$$
These can both be solved using the substitution $p=\cosh(u)$, and gives
$$y\sqrt{p^{2}-1}=p\sqrt{p^{2}+1}-\cosh^{-1}(p)+\alpha$$
Where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant. Dividing, we finally have
$$y=p+\frac{\cosh^{-1}(p)+\alpha}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}$$ Here I was stuck for a long time, until I realised that we also have the equation we began with: $x=py-p^{2}$, which we can solve as a quadratic in $p$ to also get
$$p=\frac{y\pm \sqrt{y^{2}-4x}}{2} \implies p^{2}=\frac{y^{2}+y^{2}-4x \pm 2y\sqrt{y^{2}-4x}}{4}$$ Thus, $$y=\frac{y\pm \sqrt{y^{2}-4x}}{2}+\frac{\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{y\pm \sqrt{y^{2}-4x}}{2}\right)+\alpha}{\sqrt{\frac{y^{2}-2x \pm y\sqrt{y^{2}-4x}}{2}-1}}$$ This is as good as I can do - we have a relation between $y$ and $x$ - am I done? Is this the correct answer? Is there an easier way? Thank you for your time. Following the suggestion by @Valentin $$\frac{dy}{dp}=1+\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}\sqrt{p^{2}-1}-p\frac{\cosh^{-1}(p)+\alpha}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}}{p^{2}-1}=1+p\frac{1-\frac{\cosh^{-1}(p)+\alpha}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}}{p^{2}-1}$$
Hence, $$dx=\frac{dy}{p}=dp\left(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1-\frac{\cosh^{-1}(p)+\alpha}{\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}}{p^{2}-1}\right)$$","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'integration']"

329735,Kostrikin's Definition of Tensor Product,"I'm having serious trouble to understand the definition of tensor products from Kostrikin's Linear Algebra and Geometry. Until now I've understood a tensor as a multilinear map from the cartesian product of $k$ copies of a vector space $V$ to the underlying field of scalars. However I was instructed to study the multilinear construction from Kostrikin's book, and I'm really not understanding what he's trying to do. Well, i'll post how he constructs the tensor product, and then post my doubts. Any help or reference is very good. He constructs the tensor product in three steps: Let $L_1,L_2\cdots L_p$ a family of vector spaces over the same field $\mathbb{K}$. Define the set $M$ of all functions with finite support on $L_1\times L_2\times\cdots\times L_p$ and with values in $\mathbb{K}$, in other words, all functions from this cartesian product to $\mathbb{K}$ which vanish at all except a finite number of points of the domain. One basis consists of the functions $\delta(l_1, l_2 \dots l_p)$ which is $1$ at the point $(l_1, l_2 ...l_p)$ and zero everywhere else. He also omits the $\delta$ symbol, so that we have
$$M=\left\{\sum a_{l_1\cdots l_p}(l_1,l_2\cdots l_p) \mid a_{l_1\cdots l_p} \in \mathbb{K} \right\}$$ Consider the subspace $M_0$ generated by the vectors on $M$ of the form:
$$(l_1\cdots l'_j+l''_j\cdots l_p) - (l_1\cdots l'_j\cdots l_p) - (l_1\cdots l''_j\cdots l_p)$$
$$(l_1\cdots al_j\cdots l_p) - a(l_1\cdots l_j\cdots l_p) \quad \quad a\in \mathbb{K}$$ The tensor product is then defined as 
$$L_1\otimes L_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes L_p = M / M_0$$
$$l_1\otimes l_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes l_p = (l_1, l_2\cdots l_p) + M_0$$
$$t: L_1 \times L_2 \times \cdots \times L_p \to L_1\otimes L_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes L_p, \quad t(l_1, l_2 \cdots l_p) = l_1 \otimes l_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes l_p$$ Well, I already did my best to understand this definition, but it just can't get it. First, he says that this definition is being made to be able to construct some universal multilienear application. That's fine, but why this definition allows us this? What's the intuition behind this definition? Second, on step 1 he consider functions that vanishes at all points except a finite number. Well, why these delta functions form a basis ? I don't understand why, since for me it seems that for using those delta, we would need to know on which points the functions is not zero. Third, why considering that subspace $M_0$ ? I just can't grasp what's the reason for this. And finally fourth: why setting the tensor product as that quotient space ? I really thought a lot already on this definition, trying to came out with something, however I couldn't have any idea. Can someone give some help? Thanks in advance, and really sorry if this question is too long, too specific or too silly. I'm just very confused with this definition.","['linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"

The category of coherent sheaves is an expansion of the category of holomorphic vector bundles on an elliptic curve so that the category becomes abelian. This is what allows you to take the derived category. There is also an intrinsic characterization of coherent sheaves, which is like the characterization of a holomorphic vector bundle as a locally free sheaf of $O_X$ modules but loosens the locally free condition.

There are a few necessary yet not sufficient conditions: in the general case one would require there be no cycles in arbitrary products of the $f_i$ (this being automatically the case in my scenario), and my case we must have for any $x\neq y\in S$ and $m,m'\in M$ ($M$ stands for the submonoid of functions we are working with) such that $m(x)=m'(y)\neq m(y)$ then $m(y)\neq m'(x)$.

329936,primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form,"Expired by this question Show determinant of matrix is non-zero I am moved to ask: Given integers $a,b,c,$ and cubic form
$$ f(a,b,c) = a^3+2 b^3-6 a b c+4 c^3 = \left|\begin{bmatrix} a & 2c & 2b\\b & a & 2c\\ c & b & a\end{bmatrix}\right|,  $$ 
what primes $p$ can be integrally represented as
$$  p = f(a,b,c)? $$ I think it is $3,$ all primes $p \equiv 2 \pmod 3,$ and all $p = u^2 + 27 v^2$ in integers, but not any $q = 4 u^2 + 2 u v + 7 v^2.$ I checked for $p < 10000.$ Note that, if $-p$ is represented, so is $p.$ Although it does not finish things, note that if $f$ integrally represents both $m,n$ then it represents $mn.$ That is because $f(a,b,c) = \det(aI + b X + c X^2),$ where
$$ X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 2\\1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}.  $$ Then $X^3 = 2 I$ and $X^4 = 2 X.$ I once asked a guy at MSRI about pretty much the same problem, only instead of the important polynomial being $\lambda^3 - 2$ it was $\lambda^3 - \lambda^2 - \lambda - 1.$ The phrase norm forms came up, and he laughed at me. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= p           a           b           c

Let $G$ be a group and denote its Frattini subgroup by $\Phi(G)$.  I know that $\Phi(G)$ is the intersection of the maximal subgroups of $G$, and I know that it is the set of 'non-generators' (Isaacs calls them 'useless' elements) of $G$, i.e. elements $u$ for which if $\langle X \cup \{u\} \rangle =G$, then $\langle X \rangle = G$, or equivalently, if $\langle X \rangle \ne G$, then $\langle X \cup \{u\} \rangle \ne G$, where $X \subseteq G$ is a subset of $G$, and $u \in \Phi(G)$. Since $\Phi(G)$ is the set of these elements, it would help to better understand what exactly these elements are.  Is it true that such an element $u \in \Phi(G)$ is necessarily a product of elements in $X \subseteq G$ ($u$ and $X$ as above)?  If not, what is an example where it isn't? Finally, where exactly does the connection lie between these 'non-generators' and (the intersection of) maximal subgroups?  How do we see that they must lie in a maximal subgroup, and conversely that if an element lies in all maximal subgroups then it must be a 'non-generator'?
