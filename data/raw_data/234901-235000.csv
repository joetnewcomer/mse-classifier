4911301,A question on Gamma function,"This might be basic but I have difficulty understanding what exactly goes wrong in the following logic: Consider the Gammma function $$\Gamma(z) = \int_0^{\infty} t^{z-1} \, e^{-t}\,dt \quad \textrm{Re}(z) >0.$$ Now let us consider $z=1+iy$ with $y\in \mathbb R$ . Then, it seems to me that by triangle inequality there holds: $$ |\Gamma(1+iy)| \leq \int_0^{\infty} |t^{iy}\,e^{-t}|\,dt \leq 1.$$ However, the previous inequality is obviously in contradiction with Stirling's asymptotic formula for $y$ large.

4911374,"Proving that $\Bbb Z$ is, up to isomorphism, the smallest domain into which we can embed $\Bbb N$","This question is ultimately motivated by this one (I am studying from the same book), but I feel like there is much more to be said and so I am hoping to ask a new one. I've given the whole theorem below but want to emphasize that I am only interested in the uniqueness claim here. Asides in square brackets [] are given by me. 9.1 Theorem There is a smallest[in the sense that $\Bbb Z$ embeds into any other ] [integral] domain (commutative ring without zero divisors) with unity, $\Bbb Z$ , such that $\Bbb N \subset \Bbb Z$ [in the sense of there existing an isomorphic embedding $E_\Bbb Z: \Bbb N \to \Bbb Z$ ], and the ring operations on $\Bbb Z$ restrict to the usual operations on $\Bbb N$ . This ring is unique up to isomorphism and is called the ring of integers. Now lots is to be proved in the theorem above, so I want to emphasize again that with this question I am only interested in the last sentence: This ring is unique up to isomorphism and is called the ring of integers. [More precisely, we claim that $R$ and $\Bbb Z$ are isomorphic for any domain $R$ into which $\Bbb N$ embeds, and for which $R$ embeds into $S$ for any other domain $S$ into which $\Bbb N$ embeds.] I am hoping to summarize a proof strategy: is the following correct? My proof strategy: Let us say that a domain $S$ is smallest (in our present context) if $\Bbb N$ embeds into $S$ with $E_S$ and if, for any other domain $R$ such that $E_R: \mathbb{N}\to R$ is some embeddings of the naturals, then a unique embedding $F_{S,R}: S\to R$ is induced which (*, this will be used later) restricts to that of $E_R: \mathbb{N}\to R$ (that is, for all $n \in \Bbb N$ , $F_{S,R} \mid_{E_S(\mathbb{N})}(E_S(n)) = E_R(n)$ ). (1) Show that $\Bbb Z$ is a smallest domain. Proof .  Omitted. (2) Suppose that $S$ is a smallest domain. Then $\Bbb Z \cong S$ . Proof .  We have by hypothesis and (1) that there exist unique embeddings $F_{S,\Bbb Z}, F_{\Bbb Z,S}$ . Since both embeddings are (by part of the definition of embedding) injective, it is sufficient to verify that $F_{S,\Bbb Z} \circ F_{\Bbb Z,S} = I_\Bbb Z$ in order to show that $F_{\Bbb Z,S}$ has an inverse (and is thus bijective, and so an isomorphism since it's already a homomorphism). Thus we let $a \in \Bbb Z$ and note that by definition of $a$ there exist naturals $m,n$ such that $a = [(m,n)]$ . By basic properties in $\Bbb Z$ we have $$a = [(m,n)] = [(m,0)] + [(0,n)] = [(m,0)] + (-[(n,0)]) = E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n).$$ Then, calculating, we find that $$F_{S,\Bbb Z} \circ F_{\Bbb Z,S}(a) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(a)) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n))) = F_{S,\Bbb Z}(F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (m)) - F_{\Bbb Z,S}(E_\Bbb Z (n))) \stackrel{(1)}{=} F_{S,\Bbb Z}(E_S(m) - E_S(n)) \stackrel{(1)}{=} E_\Bbb Z (m) - E_\Bbb Z (n) = a,$$ where we have made various uses of the homomorphism properties of the $F_i$ and where in the crucial steps marked (1) we have used the property (*) above. My questions: (1) Does my proof (strategy) appear correct? (2) In my definition of smallest above (developed after a discussion with others), I mention that ""then a unique embedding $F_{S,R}: S\to R$ is induced"". Where is this hypothesis about the embedding being unique used or needed (not a question about whether it's true or not)? As far as I can tell, all we need is the property (*) which the embedding has.","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification', 'integers']"
4911391,Binary digital sum (Hamming weight) of Arithmetic Progression,"Context I was recently going through the Putnam 2023 problems and the topic of this post is question $\text{B2}$ from there. For each positive integer $n$ , let $k(n)$ be the number of ones in the binary representation of $(2023\cdot n)$ . What is the minimum value of $k(n)$ ? Now, the given solution takes a brute force approach, showing that $k(n)$ can’t be equal to $1$ or $2$ and then giving example of a case where $k(n)$ equals $3$ . However their approach is not easily generalizable, and I am looking for something better. Problem Given a non-negative integer $x$ , define $C(x)$ to be the binary digital sum of $x$ (the number of ones in the binary representation of $x$ ). Now for a particular non-negative integer $n$ , consider the following sequence: $$ C(n) , C(2n), C(3n) , \cdots , C(kn) , \cdots $$ What can we say about the pattern followed in this particular sequence? Modified Thue-Morse sequence Let us consider the sequence $ C(0) , C(1) , C(2) , \cdots $ Simplifying each term, we get this sequence: $$0,1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,3,2,3,3,4,1,2,2,3,2,3,3,4,2,3,3,4,3,4,4,5,\cdots$$ This is the OEIS $\text{A000120}$ sequence . This sequence is reminiscent of the Thue-Morse sequence . While the Thue-Morse sequence takes the current string and adds its complement at the end of the string, in this sequence we have to add the element-wise successor of the string at the end of the current string. It can be easily shown that this corresponds to the idea of binary digital sum. Finally… However, this pattern breaks down as soon as we take the sequence $C(x), C(2x), C(3x), …$ where $x$ isn’t a perfect power of $2$ . For example, for the sequence $C(0),C(3),C(6),C(9),...$ we get OEIS $A036555$ : $$0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 2, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6, 5, 6, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 5, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6,...$$ OEIS $A046820$ is the sequence $C(0), C(5), C(10),...$ My question is, what can we comment about the sequence $C(0), C(x), C(2x), C(3x),...$ for any $x$ in general? This might seem a bit open-ended, but I am looking for anything that might be of interest regarding the sequence: Patterns that appear in the sequence, generating function, etc. Even after setting the bounty, this question has not received as much response as I had hoped for. Could someone please tell if this might be better suited on Math Overflow?","['contest-math', 'binary', 'elementary-number-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'recreational-mathematics']"

4911508,$L^{\infty}(X)$ is weak-star sequentially complete,"I'm trying to prove that if $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ is $\sigma$ -finite, then $L^{\infty}(X)$ with the $w^{*}$ -topology is sequentially complete, but I am running into an issue at the last step. Suppose that $(f_n)_n \subset L^{\infty}(X)$ is a $w^{*}$ -Cauchy sequence.  Then by identifying $f_n \mapsto \varphi_n$ where: $$\varphi_n(g) = \int_{X} f_ng \: d\mu$$ via the duality $L^1(X)^{*} \cong L^{\infty}(X)$ (since the measure space is $\sigma$ -finite) we then conclude that for each $g \in L^1(X)$ , $|\varphi_n(g) - \varphi_m(g)| \longrightarrow 0$ by definition of being $w^{*}$ -Cauchy.  However then $(\varphi_n(g))_n \subset \mathbb{C}$ converges to a number $\varphi(g) \in \mathbb{C}$ by completeness. Define $\varphi: L^1(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $\varphi(g) = \lim_n \varphi_n(g)$ .  Obviously $\varphi$ is linear, so if we just prove that $\varphi$ is bounded, then $\varphi \in L^1(X)^{*}$ , so by the duality there exists a map $f \in L^{\infty}(X)$ such that: $$\varphi(g) = \int_{X}fg \: d\mu = \lim_n \varphi_n(g) =\lim_n \int_{X} f_ng \: d\mu \: \: \forall g \in L^1(\mu).$$ In particular then, $f_n \longrightarrow f$ in the $w^{*}$ -topology on $L^{\infty}(X)$ by definition, which will finish the proof. I'm having an issue actually proving that $\varphi$ is bounded however.  I know by the Closed Graph theorem that it suffices to consider a sequence $(g_k,\varphi(g_k)) \longrightarrow (0,\alpha) \in L^1(X) \times \mathbb{C}$ and prove that $\alpha = 0$ .  Doing that, we see: $$|\alpha| = \lim_k |\varphi(g_k)| = \lim_k \lim_n |\varphi_n(g_k)| \leq \lim_k \sup_n \int_{X} |f_ng_k| \: d\mu$$ $$\leq \lim_k \sup_n \lVert f_n \lVert_{\infty} \lVert g_k \rVert_1.$$ Hence it suffices to know that $\sup_n \lVert f_n \rVert < \infty$ , which is equivalent to proving the family of bounded linear maps $M_n: g \mapsto f_ng$ is pointwise bounded by the Uniform Boundedness Principle, however I haven't been able to show that this is true. If I knew that $(\varphi_n) \subset V^{\circ}$ (the polar) for $V \subset L^1(X)$ an open neighborhood of $0$ , then I also think I could prove $\varphi$ is bounded, as then $V^{\circ}$ is $w^{*}$ -compact, and I at least get a convergent subsequence, but this also doesn't seem apparent to me. What am I missing here to finish this argument? $\textbf{A hint}$ would be great.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

4911594,Self-homeomorphism of a punctured sphere extends to homeomorphism of the whole sphere?,"Suppose $A\subset S^2$ is a finite set of $n$ points. Let $f: S^2\setminus A\to S^2\setminus A$ be a homeomorphism. Is it true that $f$ admits an extension to a homeomorphism $g:S^2\to S^2$ such that $g(A)=A$ and $g|_{S^2\setminus A}=f$ ? I think the answer is ""yes."" My intuition is that you can take a set of pairwise disjoint circles $C_i$ around each puncture $a_i\in A$ and consider their homeomorphic images $C_i'=f(C_i)$ . The set $\{C_i: i=1,\dotsc, n\}$ and the set $\{C_i': i=1,\dotsc, n\}$ are in bijective correspondence and both constitute a set of generators for $\pi_1(S^2\setminus A)$ . Within the interior of each of these circles, $f$ is essentially a homeomorphism from a punctured closed disk to another punctured closed disk. The question then reduces to whether a homeomorphism $f:\overline{D^2}\setminus\{(0,0)\}\to \overline{D^2}\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ with $f(S^1)=S^1$ extends to a homeomorphism with $f(0,0)=(0,0)$ . I think this should follow from some variation of the Alexander trick but I am not sure. Does this seem like it's on the right track or is there an obvious problem I am missing?

4911612,Torsion Chern class,"Let $(Y, \lambda)$ be a closed, contact 3-manifold, and $\xi = \ker(\lambda)$ be the associated two-plane field.

I wonder why that is the case? Indeed, it suffices to find a complex line bundle $E$ such that $c_1(\xi \otimes E \otimes E) = c_1(\xi) + 2c_1(E)$ is torsion, since then we can take $\Gamma = PD(c_1(E))$ (or the homology class of the zero locus of a generic section of $E$ ).

This gives us $6+9=15$ ways to set the integer $1$ . WLOG, if $2$ is to be mapped to the same value as the interval $(1,2)$ we have only $2$ possible values for the interval $(2,3)$ . And if it is not to be mapped to the same value then we have $2\cdot 3$ ways to set $2$ and $(2,3)$ . Giving us $2+6=8$ ways. Same process goes for $3$ . So until now have $15\cdot 8\cdot 8$ . Then we multiply this with $2\cdot 2$ since there are $2$ options for $0$ and $4$ each in every case. This gives us an answer of $15\cdot 8\cdot 8\cdot 4$ .

4911616,How to reconcile the formal definition of a k-form with differential k-form and integral notation?,"Forgive my basic understanding, my background is in physics/engineering, not mathematics. Please be gentle :) As I understand it, k-forms are elements of a dual space that is multilinear and alternating, with k basis vectors (including some additional determinant-like properties - again, excuse my informalities). Then, one can define a derivative on k-forms. For example, take the derivative of a 0-form (i.e., a smooth function) $\omega$ , or, $d\omega = \sum_{j=1}^n\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial{x_{i}}}dx_j$ . This object now has a dual vector $dx_j$ waiting to eat a k-vector. Yet, we treat this as a differential as a function, which confuses me. Maybe in other words, if we integrate a k-form $\omega = fdx_{I}$ over some region $\Omega$ , we have $\int_{\Omega} \omega = \int_{\Omega}fdV$ . Again, on the left-hand side, we have $\omega = fdx_{I}$ , where $fdx_{I}$ is a multilinear map waiting to eat a k-vector and send it to $\mathbb{R}$ . But when we integreate, we assume we have a number, without ever multiplying by a vector on the right-hand side. How to reconcile this notation? One more apology for the likely naive question.

1+\frac{1}{z^k}=0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad 1+\frac{1}{z^k}+\frac{1}{(z+1)^k}=0,

I'm not sure if this is true, I'm basing this on numerical evidence. Of course the first equation is equivalent to $z^k=-1$ , so all the zeros lie on the unit circle and it is easy to explicitely compute the zeros. The problem is with the second equation, there can be some zeros outside the unit circle, so the condition $\frac{\pi}{2}\lt \mbox{Arg}(z) \lt \frac{2\pi}{3}$ is really important here. Intuitively what I think happens is that in this region the term $1/(z+1)^k$ is small for big $k$ , but when $\mbox{Arg}(z)$ is close to $2\pi/3$ this is not always the case (in that case $|1/(z+1)^k|\approx 1$ , so it does contribute to the second equation). Is there a way to get past the issue near $2\pi/3$ and show that the two equations have the same number of zeros and moreover the solutions are close to each other?

Consider arranging 3 red flower and 6 yellow flowers in a row. Find the probability that the 3 red roses are not separated. Here, does it matter whether we treat the flowers as distinct, or whether we treat the red flowers all the same, and all the yellows all the same. Do both produce the same answers?

Ermakov equation.,"My question is in particular about the Ermakov equation, but in general it is about the construction of general solutions to ordinary differential equations. This is the first time I see such construction, so apologies if it is too trivial. The Ermakov equation $$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + f(x) y = a y^{-3},
$$ where f(x) is a function of the independent variable $x$ and $a$ is a constant, has as a general solution $$
C_1 y^2 = a w^2 + w^2\left(C_2 + C_1\int\frac{dx}{w^2} \right)^2,
$$ for $C_1,C_2$ constants. The function $w=w(x)$ is taken as any solution of the homogeneous equation $$
\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + f(x) w = 0.
$$ The question: Why any solution $w(x)$ can yield a general solution for $y$ ? I am not sure this is obvious, or perhaps I misunderstood something. For instance, I can find, say, $w$ real and thus $y$ will be real. However, it may as well be the case that the most general solution for $w$ is complex, and then my previous real solution would generate a ""restricted"" solution for $y$ .",['ordinary-differential-equations']

I am trying to understand them from other sources if I could not understand them at that moment, because the class is crowded and I am ashamed of asking stupid question among others. The following question is one of them. I am trying to understand the proof of orbit stabilizer theorem, but I stuck in one point I made research about  the proof of orbit-stabilizer theorem. I have seen some proof approaches, but something was interesting for me. The interesting part was showing well-define property of bijection function. Let me introduce you a part of a sample proof: We define a one-to-one map $ψ$ from $Gx$ onto the collection of left cosets of $G_x$ in $G$ such that $\psi :g(x) \rightarrow gG_x$ . We must show that this map ψ is well defined,so show that if $g(x)=h(x)$ where $g,h \in G$ , then $gG_x=hG_x$ . Here $Gx$ denotes orbits and $G_x$ denotes stabilizer I did not write the rest of proof,because my question is up to now. I saw some proofs in my other math classes such that we used bijective functions for showing one to one correspondence between sets to show that their cardinalities are equal, but we have never needed to prove that the functions we selected for bijectivity is well defined by using the condition if $x=y$ where x and y are elements of domain,then $f(x)=f(y)$ Look here for well defined However, when I look at all proofs in books and internet, they always firstly prove that the bijection function $\psi :g(x) \rightarrow gG_x$ is well defined. Then, why did they need to show its well-defined property in this proof. If showing firstly being well-defined function is mandatory in bijective functions, why dont we always see it in some other proofs ?

A general strategy to show this, is to take two functions, say $y=\phi(x)$ and $y=\psi(x)$ such that $\lim_{x\to 0}\phi(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}\psi(x)=0$ and show that $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x,\phi(x))\neq \lim_{x\to 0} f(x,\psi(x))$ (, also we note that, as $x\to 0$ we have, $(x,y)=(x,\phi(x))\to(0,0)$ and $(x,y)=(x,\phi(x))\to (0,0)$ ). We let $y=\phi(x)=x$ and $y=\psi(x)=x^2.$ We have, $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases} \cfrac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}, & x\neq 0 \\ 0,&x=0 \end{cases}$$ and so, if $L=\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)$ exists then, $L=\lim_{x\to 0}f(x,\phi(x))=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^3}{x^4+x^2}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x}{x^2+1}=0$ . Again, $L=\lim_{x\to 0}f(x,\psi(x))=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^4}{x^4+x^4}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{2}=\frac 12.$ This is what we've wanted to show and $L=\frac 12$ gives us a contradiction as $\frac 12\neq 0.$ So, $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist. This proves that at $(0,0)$ the function is discontinuous if $\beta=0.$ On second thought, I tried to prove the same thing using the ""approach of polar  coordinates' as follows: Just like the previous approach, we try to show that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist but this time using polar coordinates. We have, $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\cfrac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}=\lim_{r\to 0} \cfrac {r^3\cos^2\theta\sin\theta}{r^4\cos^4\theta+r^2\sin^2\theta}=\lim_{r\to 0} \cfrac {r\cos^2\theta\sin\theta}{r^2\cos^4\theta+\sin^2\theta}=0.$ So, surprisingly we end up seeing that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=f(0,0)$ due to which we may conclude that $f$ is continuous at $(0,0).$ Both approaches should have given me the same conclusion, but this is not happening in my case. However, I don't understand where did I go wrong in this second approach of mine? Is my first approach, correct?

A map $F:X\to Y$ is called Fréchet differentiable with derivative $\mathrm{D}F(x_0)$ at $x_0\in X$ if there exists a bounded operator $\mathrm{D}F(x_0):X\to Y$ such that for all $h\in X$ $$ \lim_{\lVert h\rVert_X\to 0}\frac{\lVert F(x_0+h)-F(x_0)-\mathrm{D}F(x_0)(h) \rVert_Y}{\lVert h\rVert_X} = 0. $$ I can see the intuition behind this definition as follows: the usual limit definition in one-variable calculus is $$ \lim_{x \to x_0}\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0} = f'(x_0) \equiv \mathrm{D}f(x_0). $$ Move terms and add $|\cdot|$ to get $$ \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\left|f(x)-f(x_0)-\mathrm{D}f(x_0)(x-x_0)\right|}{|x-x_0|} = 0,$$ which has the same form as the Fréchet derivative. However, I find it hard to conceptualise the derivative for more abstract spaces, such as in the space of matrices or integral of functions. An example I came across another day is the derivative in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ . Consider the inverse map $$ F:\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})\to\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})\equiv A \mapsto A^{-1}, $$ where $$\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) = \{ A \;|\;\mathrm{det}(A) \neq 0 \}.$$ Following the above definition, we can differentiate $F$ (with respect to what?!) and find that for all $A\in\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ , $H\in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ $$ \mathrm{D}F(A)(H) = -A^{-1}HA^{-1}.$$ There have been several posts about this ( 1 , 2 ), using various methods to arrive at the result, but none of them seem to give an intuitive interpretation.

Context and Motivation: This problem came up while I was studying real analysis and the concept of uniform convergence. I understand that for a sequence of functions to converge uniformly to a limiting function, the speed of convergence must be independent of the choice of $x$ in the domain. I'm interested in seeing how this plays out for the given sequence of functions, especially since they involve a square root, which can often lead to interesting behavior. My Attempts: I've tried to find the pointwise limit of the sequence by taking the limit as $n$ goes to infinity, which gives me the function $$f(x) = |x|$$ . However, I'm unsure if the convergence is uniform. I've also noticed that each $f_n$ is differentiable, but I'm not sure if the limiting function $f$ is differentiable on $[-1,1]$ due to the absolute value.

I know what the points are, but I'm having trouble coming up with an explicit proof. Here's what I have so far: Since $\cos(x) \in [-1,1] \; \forall x$ there are only three cases for $\lfloor \cos(\sqrt{n}) \rfloor$ and we can rewrite $c_n$ as: $$ c_n = \left \lfloor{\cos(\sqrt{n})}\right \rfloor = \begin{cases} 
    1 & \cos(\sqrt{n}) = 1 \\
    0 & 0 \leq \cos(\sqrt{n}) < 1 \\
    -1 & -1 \leq \cos(\sqrt{n}) < 0
   \end{cases} $$ Thus, the only candidates for accumulation points are $\{-1,0,1\}$ , since that's the only values $c_n$ can assume. Regarding 1, we have: \begin{align*}
    c_n &= 1\\
    \Leftrightarrow \cos(\sqrt{n}) &= 1\\
    \Leftrightarrow \sqrt{n} &= 2k \pi \text{ for et $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$} \\
    \Leftrightarrow n &= 4k^2 \pi^2 \text{ for et $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$}
\end{align*} We see that this equality only holds for $n=0$ , since $\pi^2$ is irrational and $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ . So 1 is not an accumulation point, since the sequence only assumes the value 1 once. I know both 0 and -1 are accumulation points, corresponding to $\sqrt{n} \in (0, \frac{\pi}{2}) \cup (\frac{3\pi}{2}, 2\pi)$ and $\sqrt{n} \in (\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2})$ respectively.

And in order to evaluate that limit, we need to show that $f$ is continuous at $2$ . So we end up with a circular definition of continuity. In precalculus (or ""Advanced Integrated Math 3"" in my case), we did learn about the concept of continuity but without any rigorous definition. We would just kind of look at the graph and use our intuition to determine where the function is continuous and where it is discontinuous.

By ""writing a sum as integral"" I mean calculus-first-course-style things like $$\lim _{N\rightarrow \infty }\frac {1}{N}\sum _{n=1}^N\frac {1}{1+n/N}=\int _0^1\frac {dx}{1+x}.$$","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'power-series']"
4912716,Is every triangle a difference of two squares?,"Two complex numbers $z,w \in \mathbb C$ determine a triangle with the origin. The (signed) area of this triangle is $$A(z,w)=\frac{1}{2} \det \begin{pmatrix} \Re z & \Re w \newline \Im z & \Im w \end{pmatrix}.$$ You can verify that this is identical to the formula $A(z,w)=\frac 18 (|w+iz|^2-|w-iz|^2)$ . This makes me think that there should be some kind of geometric construction that explains this identity, e.g. something like you can take a square in the plane (of some size and orientation), cut out another square, and then find that the leftover area decomposes into 8 identical triangles. I haven't been able to come up with such an argument or construction. And googling for things like ""triangle area"" or ""triangle and difference of squares"" only leads to things about high school geometry.

4912770,"Difficulty Understanding the Concept of ""Measures""","I am self-studying topics in probability (I am in mechanical engineering) and I have been able to get by without having to fully understand the concept of ""Measures"". I tried reading about them and watching videos on the internet, and now I think I have a better idea. For example, I am trying to understand the Radon-Nikodym Derivative ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon%E2%80%93Nikodym_theorem ). Here is what I understand: Suppose I have a random variable $X$ with probability distribution $f(x)$ . I want to modify this random variable in such a way, such that for any given value of $x$ , the modified value of $x$ changes by some factor (e.g. small change in denominator results in a certain change in the numerator): $$\frac{dQ}{dP} = \frac{f_Q(x)}{f_P(x)}$$ However, the problem is that while I get to decide what $\frac{dQ}{dP}$ equals to,  I don't what choice of $f_Q(x)$ will result in this modification (e.g. make sure that the final result is a valid probability distribution function). If I understand correctly, the Radon-Nikodym Derivative helps us determine properties of this modified probability distribution function, such as its Expected Value and the final formula for this distribution itself: $$E_Q[Y] = E_P\left[\frac{dQ}{dP} \cdot Y\right]$$ $$f_Q(x) = f_P(x) \cdot \frac{dQ}{dP}$$ I tried to create a sample problem involving the Radon-Nikodym Derivative to test my understanding. Suppose I have a standard Normal Distribution under measure $P$ and I want to modify it such that under some new measure $Q$ , the following relationship is true: $$f_P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}$$ $$dQ/dP = e^X$$ I can first use the Radon-Nikodym Derivative to find out the probability distribution function under the new measure: $$f_Q(x) = f_P(x) \cdot \frac{dQ}{dP} = f_P(x) \cdot e^x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \cdot e^x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{x - x^2/2}$$ I can also use the Radon-Nikodym Derivative to find out the Expected Value of this new probability distribution function: $$E_Q[Y] = E_P\left[\frac{dQ}{dP} \cdot Y\right]$$ $$E_Q[Y] = E_P[e^X \cdot Y]$$ $$E_Q[Y] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y \cdot e^x \cdot f_P(x) \cdot f_P(y) \, dy \, dx$$ $$E_Q[Y] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y \cdot e^x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-y^2/2} \, dy \, dx$$ Is this the correct understanding?

I have a counterexample $G=(1-x^2,-xy,-xz)$ which vanishes only at $(\pm 1, 0,0)$ and the index of each of these points are +1. Thus the argument below does not work. Can someone hint which part of the argument is wrong. Can the argument work under some additional assumptions on the vector field $G$ ? Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a continuous vector field on $\mathbb{S}^2$ such that $\mathbb{G}(x) = \mathbb{G}(-x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{S}^2$ . If $\mathbb{G}$ vanishes at $x^*, -x^* \in \mathbb{S}^2$ then we must have \begin{equation}\label{index}
\operatorname{Ind}_{x^*} \mathbb{G} + \operatorname{Ind}_{-x^*} \mathbb{G} = 0.

Parametrize the circle $\Gamma$ with $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$ , such that the parametrization is in a counterclockwise orientation when viewed from the point $x^*$ , say $\gamma: [0,2\pi] \to \Gamma$ with $\gamma(0) = x_0$ . This parametrization also provides a parametrization for $\bar{\Gamma}$ as follows: $\bar{\gamma}: [0,2\pi] \to \bar{\Gamma}$ $$\bar{\gamma}(\theta) = -\gamma(\theta).$$ Now notice that \begin{equation}
\mathbb{G}(\bar{\gamma}(\theta)) = \mathbb{G}(\gamma(\theta)), \quad \theta \in [0,2\pi],

But we may simplify it into $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^{2}k}{(1+a\cos k)\sqrt{1+b\cos k}}dk$ which is very similar to the complete elliptic integral of the third kind. By residue theorem Although there is an irrational term, I try to use the trick $\int_{0}^{2\pi}R(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)d\theta=\int_{|z|=1}R(\frac{z+z^{-1}}{2},\frac{z-z^{-1}}{2i})\frac{dz}{iz}$ . Then, the integral can be written as $$\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{(z^2-1)^2}{(z+a)(z+a^{-1})}\frac{\sqrt{z}}{z^2\sqrt{(z+b)(z+b^{-1})}}dz
$$ Here $z=0$ is branch point of $\sqrt{z}$ and also the pole of order 2. Then, we may construct a contour as following We first estimate the integral over $C_R$ , $$\left|\oint_{C_R} \frac{(z^2-1)^2}{(z+a)(z+a^{-1})}\frac{\sqrt{z}}{z^2\sqrt{(z+b)(z+b^{-1})}}dz\right|\leq \max\left|\frac{(z^2-1)^2}{(z+a)(z+a^{-1})}\frac{\sqrt{z}}{z\sqrt{(z+b)(z+b^{-1})}}\right|\frac{|\int dz|}{|z|}$$ It seems that the max part is not zero which is different from the complex analysis textbook case. Is there any strategy to calculate this integral? By elliptic integral!! We thank @GEdgar and Z.G. for helpful suggestions. Recall the complete elliptic integral of the third kind ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral ), which is defined by $$\Pi(n,k)=\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_0\frac{d\theta}{(1-n\sin^2\theta)\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2\theta}}$$ , the integral $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^{2}k}{(1+a^2+2a\cos k)\sqrt{1+b^2+2b\cos k}}dk$ may be rewritten as some elliptic integral.

\partial_{tt} u + \alpha \partial_t u - \Delta u + \beta \sin(u) = 0
\end{equation} for an unknown $u : D \times [0, \infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a bounded open set with smooth boundary. Here $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ are given parameters. The equation is supplemented with Dirichlet boundary conditions: \begin{equation}
u|_{\partial D} = 0
\end{equation} and (smooth) initial conditions: \begin{equation}
u(0) = u_0, \quad \partial_t u(0) = v_0.
\end{equation} (i) Show that if $u^{(1)}$ and $u^{(2)}$ are smooth solutions of the damped Sine-Gordon equation with the same initial conditions, namely if \begin{equation}
u^{(1)}(0,x) = u^{(2)}(0,x), \quad \partial_t u^{(1)}(0,x) = \partial_t u^{(2)}(0,x) \quad \text{for all } x \in D
\end{equation} then $u^{(1)} = u^{(2)}$ on all of $D \times [0, \infty).$ (ii) Now suppose that $u^{(1)}$ and $u^{(2)}$ are any two smooth solutions of the damped Sine-Gordon equation subject to the above boundary condition. Show that there exists a constant $\rho > 0,$ depending only on $D,$ such that the quantity \begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(t) := \int_D \big[(\partial_t( u^{(1)}(t,x) - u^{(2)}(t,x))^2 + |\nabla(u^{(1)}(t,x) - u^{(2)}(t,x))|^2\big] dx
\end{equation} with an exponential rate in time whenever \begin{equation}
\frac{|\beta|}{\alpha} < \rho.
\end{equation} Proof: This is my proof for i) but I am not sure if it is correct and I am stuck on ii) Let $w = u^{(1)} -u^{(2)}$ then $w$ satisfies: \begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} w + \alpha \partial_t w - \Delta w + \beta [\sin(u^{(1)})-\sin(u^{(2)})] = 0
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
w|_{\partial D} = 0
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
w(0,x) = \partial_t w(0,x) = 0
\end{equation} Let $E(t)=\dfrac{1}{2}\displaystyle \int_{D}(w_t)^2+|\nabla w|^2dx$ then \begin{align}
\dot{E}(t)&=\displaystyle\int_D w_t(w_{tt}-\Delta w))\\
& = -\alpha \displaystyle\int_D (w_t)^2dx -\beta \displaystyle\int_D (w_t)[\sin(u^{(1)})-\sin(u^{(2)})]\\
& \leq  -\alpha \displaystyle\int_D (w_t)^2dx +|\beta|\displaystyle\int_D |w||w_t|dx
\end{align} Apply Young- $\varepsilon$ and Poincare's inequality for $|\beta| \displaystyle\int_D |w||w_t|dx$ , we deduce $$\dot{E}(t) \leq \left(\dfrac{|\beta|\varepsilon}{2}-\alpha \right)\displaystyle\int_D (w_t)^2dx +\dfrac{|\beta|C_0}{2\varepsilon} \displaystyle\int_D |\nabla w|^2dx$$ Choose $C = \max \{\dfrac{|\beta| \varepsilon}{2}-\alpha;\dfrac{|\beta|C_0}{2\varepsilon}\}$ then $$\dot{E}(t) \leq C E(t)$$ By Gronwall's inequality,we get $$E(t) \leq e^C.E(0)=0$$ Thus $E(t)=0,$ which implies $w=0$ then we complete the proof. Am I correct for $i$ ? And for ii) I thought that we can do the same like i), for $\rho$ we can choose $\rho = \max \{\dfrac{|\beta| \varepsilon}{2}-\alpha;\dfrac{|\beta|C_0}{2\varepsilon}; \dfrac{|\beta|}{\alpha}\}$ but the problem is $\rho$ is not only dependent on $D$ but also $\beta$ and $\alpha,$ which does not satisfy the requirement. Could someone give me any better ideas? Because of ii) give the hint $\frac{|\beta|}{\alpha} <\rho$ , it makes me think my approach for i) may not be good. The constant $C$ I chose quite not well. Hint:
The professor gave us the hint that: For i) If $w = u^1 - u^2$ consider the equation satisfied by $v^\epsilon = \partial_t w + \epsilon w,$ for an $\epsilon > 0$ a parameter to be tuned.  Then try to do an $L^2$ type energy estimate for $v^\epsilon.$ So it is different from what I did in the proof. But I haven't yet figured out the hint. For ii)
You can also add two simplifications here to this part of the problem 1) that the domain yields a Poincare constant of 1 to simply calculations and 2) that you only need to prove the exponential decay for $\beta < \rho \min\{\alpha, 1\}$ for an appropriate choice of rho (I think something like $\rho=1/2$ will do).  It's just playing with epsilon young's inequality to get an appropriate differential inequality to apply Gronwall.","['young-inequality', 'gronwall-type-inequality', 'analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

The obvious example for $l=1$ is $$x^2+y^2+z^2$$ This is a duplicate of this 2017 MSE question and the answer there is helpful but only partial. Unless I'm mistaken, $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ -invariance should boil down to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ -invariance, and thus to $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ -invariance. This (under the guise of binary forms) has been studied for over 100 years and people apparently have found (minimal) generators of invariants of $k[\mathrm{Sym}^n(k^2)]$ for up to $n=8$ , maybe further. But I'm not asking for a full set of generators, I just want one (nonconstant) polynomial for each $n$ . Edit : I'm clarifying the action of $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}^{l+1}$ for the benefit of a commenter below. I also provide a nontrivial example for $l=2$ . The action of $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2l+1}$ has been known for a very long time. The idea is that there's a map $\mathrm{SU}(2)\rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ with kernel $I, -I$ , so any irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ where $-I$ acts trivially (namely, the irreps of odd dimension) will descend to a representation of $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ . The simplest way of realizing this representation is in terms of harmonic polynomials. Note that $\mathrm{SO}(3)\subset \mathrm{GL}(3)$ acts naturally on $\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]_l$ , the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $l$ . Let $\mathfrak{h}_3^l$ be the $2l+1$ -dimensional vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]_l$ consisting of the degree $l$ harmonic polynomials. This is defined as the kernel of the Laplacian $\Delta=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z^2}$ . The subspace $\mathfrak{h}_3^l$ is preserved by the action of $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ because the elements of $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ commute with the Laplacian. Finally, my question: $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ acts on $\mathbb{R}[\mathfrak{h}_3^l]$ . I seek a polynomial in this space
which is fixed by the action (it is known to exist!). Example for $l=1$ : the vector space $\mathfrak{h}_3^1$ is spanned by the polynomials $p_1=x,p_2=y,p_3=z$ (they are all killed by the Laplacian). Now $\mathbb{R}[\mathfrak{h}_3^1]=\mathbb{R}[p_1,p_2,p_3]$ and there is an obvious $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ -invariant polynomial of degree $2$ : $p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2$ . Example for $l=2$ : the vector space $\mathfrak{h}_3^2$ is spanned by the polynomials $p_1=x^2-y^2$ , $p_2=y^2-z^2$ , $q_1=yz$ , $q_2=xz$ , $q_3=xy$ . Now consider the algebra $\mathbb{R}[\mathfrak{h}_3^2]=\mathbb{R}[p_1,p_2,q_1,q_2,q_3]$ . A quick calculation shows that the polynomial $f:=p_1^2+p_1p_2+p_2^2+3(q_1^2+q_2^2+q_3^2)$ is $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ -invariant. Can anyone give such a polynomial for arbitrary $l$ ?

The question is best asked with a visual: I am looking to find a sequence (of any length) of strictly decreasing (strictly because otherwise you can pick seven 1s and pack a hex lattice) integer radii such that the final circle perfectly covers the central one. In other words, such that it is also tangent to the second circle (the first non-central). The above image is the closest I've been able to brute force search (20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 14, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2), it misses by about 5.39x10e-6. My search would be sped up if I knew more about how to do a weird version of Newton-Raphson with binary string permutations. Take the above example. I can encode the sequence like this (ignoring the central circle/implying its size by the length of the string): 1111010000010011110. It is the smallest binary number with ten 1s that overlaps with the rightmost circle. The previous lexicographical permutation (1111010000010011101) should(?) represent the largest binary representation that does not overlap. For a given central radius and number of surrounding circles, there should exist a pair of sequences that are lexicographically adjacent that span this overlap. I have a way to increment a binary string permutation, but have not found a way to find the midpoint of two distinct lexicographic permutations. That would speed up my search immensely and allow me to employ a bit of N-R.* Edit: I'm becoming very skeptical of the above assertion the more I examine it, but I'll leave it up in case it helps on any level.","['binary', 'number-theory', 'integers', 'circles', 'geometry']"

How many paths are there to h8 . I know this is a duplicate question that has been asked once before, but no one gave a final numerical answer. I am currently getting this wrong in a course, and wanted some outside feedback. My process is as follows: Observe that the king's number of right and upward moves are always equal Observe that any time the king moves diagonally, it takes away one upward and one right move So, without any diagonal moves, the king's total paths would be all permutations of 7 right moves and 7 upward moves. For 1 diagonal move, it would be 6 of each, and 1 diagonal, .... So the solution would be as follows: $$\frac{14!}{2*7!} + \frac{13!}{2*6!*1} + \frac{12!}{2*5!*2!} + \frac{11!}{2*4!*3!} + \frac{10!}{2*3!*4!} + \frac{9!}{2*2!*5!} + \frac{8!}{6!} + \frac{7!}{7!} = 14,122,893$$ This intuitively makes sense to me as the distinct permutations for each number of diagonal moves.

4913390,If sums of Normal Distributions are Normal :Why are the weighted sums of Normal Distributions non-Normal?,"I posted this question here Do 2 Normal Distributions always produce another Normal Distribution? where it was suggested to me that Characteristic Functions can be used to show that the distribution for the sums of independent Normal Distributions are still Normal. I had originally tried to prove this using Convolutions, but I think this is easier to show using Characteristic Functions: Define two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with probability distributions $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ .
Assuming that we can determine the Characteristic Functions for both of these Random Variables: $$
\phi(t) = E[e^{itX}]
$$ Then the sum of these two random variables $Z = X+Y$ has the following Characteristic Function $$
\phi_Z(t) = \phi_X(t) \cdot \phi_Y(t)
$$ Using this logic, it seems much easier to prove that the distribution for the sums of two Normal Distributions is still Normal: $$
\text{Characteristic Function of a Normal Distribution:} \quad \phi(t) = e^{iμt - \frac{1}{2}σ^2t^2}
$$ The Characteristic Functions of both Random Variables are: $$
\phi_X(t) = e^{iμ1t - \frac{1}{2}σ1^2t^2}
$$ $$
\phi_Y(t) = e^{iμ2t - \frac{1}{2}σ2^2t^2}
$$ We can then use this to find out the Characteristic Function of the sum $Z$ : $$
\phi_Z(t) = \phi_X(t) \cdot \phi_Y(t) = e^{iμ1t - \frac{1}{2}σ1^2t^2} \cdot e^{iμ2t - \frac{1}{2}σ2^2t^2}
$$ $$
\phi_Z(t) = e^{i(μ1+μ2)t - \frac{1}{2}(σ1^2+σ2^2)t^2}
$$ Using the property that Characteristic Functions are unique, we can recognize that $Z$ is basically a Normal Distribution with $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_2$ and $\sigma^2 = \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2$ . This leads me to my actual question: Are the weighted sums of Normal Distributions also Normally Distributed? I have read about Finite Mixture Models (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model ) in which a probability distribution is defined as follows: $$
f(x) = w1*\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma1^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-μ1)^2}{2\sigma1^2}} + w2*\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma2^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-μ2)^2}{2\sigma2^2}} + ... + wk*\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_k^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-μ_k)^2}{2\sigma_k^2}}
$$ $$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1
$$ $$
0 \leq w_i \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } i
$$ My initial thought was that if the sums of Normal Distributions are Normal, then shouldn't the Weighted Sums of Normal Distributions also be Normal? However on the other hand, I have seen visual representations of Finite Mixtures that don't look very Normal. I tried to write the sum of Characteristic Functions (e.g. start with only two distributions), I got: $$
\phi_{mixture}(t) = w1*\phi_{1}(t) + w2*\phi_{2}(t)
$$ $$
\phi_{mixture}(t) = w1*e^{iμ1t - \frac{1}{2}σ^2t^2} + w2*e^{iμ2t - \frac{1}{2}σ^2t^2}
$$ I am not sure if this result is Normal or Non-Normal. Can someone please help me out here? Is the above equation the Characteristic Function of a Normal Distribution?",['probability']
4913424,Induction does not preserve ordering between cardinality of sets?,"Consider building a binary tree and consider it as a collection of points and edges. Here is one with five levels, numbered level $1$ at the top with $1$ node to level $5$ at the bottom with $16$ nodes. Imagine building this in stages by level. Level one has $1$ node and $1$ path. Level $2$ adds an additional $2$ nodes for a total of $3$ nodes in the structure, but of course there are only $2$ paths (through the full tree). I will always consider a path as that which traverses level $1$ to level $n$ . So at level $n$ we have a total of $2^n-1$ nodes (in the entire tree), but the number of paths is only $2^{n-1}$ . Thus, at each stage of construction, we have strictly fewer paths than the total number of nodes in the tree. Of course, the number of paths at level $n$ is exactly the number of nodes at that particular level. If we allow ourselves to iterate this as $n$ ranges over all of $\mathbb N$ , we end up with an uncountably infinite number of paths. This feels counterintuitive and paradoxical. I am sure there is a standard explanation for why this iterative process does not respect the ordering between the number of nodes and paths. So my question is: what is the explanation for this phenomenon? More generally, I welcome any insight into how to think about this too and especially pointing out the errors in my thinking. It seems like the principle is that induction does not preserve order relations between cardinality of sets (or of sequences of sets more precisely). E.g. let $(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ and $(B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be sequences of sets such that their cardinalities are always ordered $|A_n|\leq|B_n|$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$ . Assume that "" $\lim_{n\to\infty}A_n=A$ "" and "" $\lim_{n\to\infty}B_n=B$ "" exist in some appropriate sense. Then we can have $|A|>|B|$ . (I'm not sure how to make the idea rigorous in the tree example. I've only really seen such a limit defined for nested sequences of sets.) One other thought is that I am mixing the concept of natural numbers and cardinal numbers. Thinking about these as sequences of natural numbers, they don't converge as they are just unbounded as the tree grows. But as sequences of cardinal numbers, they do sort of ""converge"" in some sense, to $\aleph_0$ and $2^{\aleph_0}$ (assuming these are the appropriate symbols here, correct me if I'm wrong.). But I don't think my standard real analysis-style of thinking applies in this situation.

4913523,Is there a nondiscrete linearly ordered topological space (LOTS) that is extremally disconnected?,"A space is extremally disconnected if the closure of every open set is open. I was wondering if there is a ordered space that is extremally disconnected but not discrete. Currently there is no such example in $\pi$ -base . Note that by this question , such space must be sequentially discrete, and hence non-sequential. Also, changing LOTS to the weaker condition $T_5$ results in a single example called the single ultrafilter topology . Any help appreciated for constructing/disproving the existence of such a space. Edit. Inspired by the existing answer I can now construct a sequentially discrete LOTS that is not discrete: Consider $X = (\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z})\cup\{\infty\}$ , with lexicographical order on $\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z}$ and that $\infty$ is larger than any other element. Every point other than $\infty$ is an isolated point because $\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z}$ is discrete, but $\infty$ is not isolated since there is no largest element in $\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z}$ . On the other hand, $\{\infty\}$ is sequentially open, which is to say there is no sequence in $\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z}$ converging to $\infty$ : For every $((a_n,b_n))_{n\in\omega}\in\omega_1\times\mathbb{Z}$ , the sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\omega}$ is bounded above by some $\alpha\in\omega_1$ , so $((a_n,b_n))_{n\in\omega}$ is bounded above by $(\alpha+1,0)$ . Edit 2. The proof in the answer generalizes easily to GO-spaces ( generalized ordered spaces ). A GO-space is a topological space $X$ with topology $\tau$ together with a linear order $<$ such that $X$ is $T_1$ and every point has a local base of $\tau$ -open neighborhoods consisting of order-convex sets. Suppose that $x$ is not an isolated point, then $(\leftarrow,x)\cup(x,\rightarrow)$ is dense, so $x\in\overline{(\leftarrow,x)}$ or $x\in\overline{(x,\rightarrow)}$ , then $x$ lies in the closure of every cofinal subset of $(\leftarrow,x)$ or $(x,\rightarrow)$ by order-convexity of local base elements of $x$ : If $U$ is an order-convex open neighborhood of $x$ , then $y\in U\cap(\leftarrow,x)$ ( resp. $y\in U\cap(x,\rightarrow)$ ) implies that $U$ contains every element $\ge y$ ( resp. $\le y$ ) of the cofinal subset.

4913759,How to Evaluate a Multi Variable Derivative?,"I am an engineering student learning about Copulas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory) ) for my bachelor's project (2 years from now). I am interested in using them for the purpose of simulating correlated failure times of machine parts. I have been self-studying topics in Probability Theory for the last year. As I understand, a Copula Function is basically a CDF (Cumulative Density Function) of correlated Random Variables: $$C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\Pr[X_1\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\dots,X_d\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)]$$ $$c(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d) = \frac{\partial^d}{\partial u_1 \partial u_2 \dots \partial u_d} C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)$$ I am interested in trying to understand the following question: Given some real world data, how exactly do we estimate the parameters of a given Copula function? For the Non-Copula case, this looks pretty straightforward to understand. For some generic probability distribution function $p(x;\theta)$ where $x$ is the data and $\theta$ is the parameter vector, I can differentiate the log-likelihood function $l(x, \theta)$ with respect to all $\theta$ parameters, set the derivatives to 0 and estimate all parameters. However, I am not sure how to repeat this process for the Copula case. For example, suppose I choose a Gaussian Copula (here, $u$ is a Uniform Random Variable): $$\text{Standard Normal CDF:} \quad   F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-\frac{1}{2}t^2} dt $$ $$\text{Inverse of a Standard Normal CDF (undefined, needs to be numerically calculated)} : \quad F^{-1}$$ $$ \text{Joint Normal CDF with mean=0 and correlation matrix R:} \quad F(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} |R|^{1/2}} \int_{-\infty}^{y_1} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{y_n} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{y}^T R^{-1} \mathbf{y}} dy_1 \cdots dy_n $$ $$ \text{Gaussian Copula :} \quad  C(u_1, u_2, ..., u_n) = \Phi_{\rho}(F^{-1}(u_1), F^{-1}(u_2), ..., F^{-1}(u_n))$$ $$ C(u_1, u_2, ..., u_n) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} |R|^{1/2}} \int_{-\infty}^{F^{-1}(u_1)} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{F^{-1}(u_n)} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}^T R^{-1} \mathbf{x}} dx_1 \cdots dx_n $$ I can also write the Probability Distribution Function and the Log-Likelihood function for a Gaussian Multivariate : $$
\text{Multivariate Normal:} \quad  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k|\Sigma|}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)\right)
$$ $$
\rho_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{ii}\sigma_{jj}}}
$$ $$
L(\mu, \Sigma | X) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i | \mu, \Sigma)
$$ $$
f(x_i | \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k|\Sigma|}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu)\right)
$$ $$
\log L(\mu, \Sigma | X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f(x_i | \mu, \Sigma)
$$ $$
\log L(\mu, \Sigma | X) = -\frac{nk}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2} \log|\Sigma| - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x_i-\mu)
$$ I am not sure how exactly we would set up the likelihood function for this Copula to estimate its parameters. For example, suppose I have two random variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ . I believe they each have marginal distributions that follow an Exponential Probability Distribution $x_i \sim Exp(\lambda_i)$ . My goal is to model both of these Exponential Random Variables using a Gaussian Copula. Prior to doing even beginning to do Copula estimation, I would first use standard MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) to estimate each $\lambda_i$ independently. From here, I would transform the original random variables into the following format (Uniform Transformation via the CDF): $$u_i = F(x_i|\lambda_i) = 1 - e^{-\lambda_i x_i}$$ Estimating the parameters of the Copula will now be done on the transformed data using $u_i$ and not the original data $x_i$ . After this point, note that the only parameters that need to be estimated are all the correlation parameters** $\rho$ which themselves are a function of $\sigma_{i,j}$ . Since a Copula Function is basically a CDF, I think we can try to determine the corresponding PDF using the derivative-integral relationship: $$
f_{C_\Sigma}(u) = \frac{\partial^n C_\Sigma(u)}{\partial u_1 \partial u_2 ... \partial u_n}
$$ From here, I might be able to then write the Likelihood function of this Copula: $$
L(\Sigma; u) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{C_\Sigma}(u_i)
$$ At this point, I am confused and longer sure how to proceed. I am not sure what will be the exact function form of $ f_{C_\Sigma}(u_i)$ . The multivariate derivative looks very complicated. I am guessing that it might be related to the pdf of a multivariate normal? $$
f_{C_\Sigma}(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{det(\Sigma)}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} z^T (I - \Sigma^{-1}) z}
$$ where $z = (\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \Phi^{-1}(u_2), ..., \Phi^{-1}(u_n))^T$ , $\Sigma$ is the correlation matrix, and $I$ is an identity matrix. Can someone please show me how to do this? From a given choice of Copula function, how would I write its corresponding likelihood function?",['probability']
4913796,Is the set of points in $\mathbb R^3$ with exactly one rational coordinate connected?,"Let \begin{align}

\end{align} Is $S$ connected? Is it path-connected? The analogous problem one dimension lower (connectedness of the points in the plane with exactly one rational coordinate) can be answered by noticing that the line $\{(x,x)\}$ does not intersect your set, so it separates it into two connected components. I suspect $S$ is connected but not path-connected because if we had an open set $A\subset \mathbb R^3$ which is not empty and not the entire space, we would want $\partial A\subset S^c$ and $S^c$ is the union of $\mathbb Q^c\times \mathbb Q^c\times \mathbb Q^c$ and a set of (Hausdorff, topological) dimension $1$ . The first is totally disconnected, and the second is really small so I think constructing such a set $A$ is impossible. On the other hand, constructing a nontrivial path $\gamma:[0,1]\to S$ seems really hard because $S_1\cup S_2=\mathbb Q^c\times(\mathbb Q^c\times\mathbb Q\cup \mathbb Q^c\times\mathbb Q)$ so if you don't visit $S_3$ you can't change your $x$ coordinate, and the same for the other permutations.",['general-topology']

I'm an adult, independent student working through calculus, trying my hand at trigonometric integrals, digressing with a bit of trigonometry practice, and so playing with the equation $\cos(x) + \sin(x) = 1$ . I feel like the following transformations of said equation are all valid, but the result is incorrect. Can someone identify the invalid inference for me? \begin{align}
\cos(x) + \sin(x) &= 1 \\
(\cos(x) + \sin(x))^2 &= 1^2 \\
\cos^2(x) + 2\sin(x)\cos(x)+ \sin^2(x) &= 1 \\
2\sin(x)\cos(x) + (\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)) &= 1 \\
2\sin(x)\cos(x) + 1 &= 1 \\
2\sin(x)\cos(x) + 1 -1 &= 1 -1 \\
2\sin(x)\cos(x) &= 0 \\
\frac{2\sin(x)\cos(x)}{2} &= \frac{0}{2} \\
\sin(x)\cos(x) &= 0

It's not hard to see that any closed chain $\Gamma$ can be rejigged into a chain of closed paths $\Gamma'$ such that $\int_\Gamma f=\int_{\Gamma'}f$ for all $f$ (e.g. if $\Gamma=\gamma+\overline\gamma$ , where $\overline\gamma$ is the reverse path, then we might take $\Gamma'=\gamma*\overline\gamma$ ), so it doesn't really matter which definition is used. I am trying to understand the proof of the following proposition Theorem: Let $U$ be open and $K\subset U$ compact and non-empty. There exists a cycle $\Gamma\subset U\setminus K$ such that for all $f:U\to\Bbb C$ hoolomorphic and $w\in K$ holds $$f(w)=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\Gamma\frac{f(z)}{z-w}\mathrm dz,$$ i.e. there is a cycle in $U\setminus K$ such that the Cauchy formula holds for it on $K$ . This is a weaker version of the statement that we can always find a cycle $\Gamma\subset U\setminus K$ that is homologous to zero in $U$ and winds around $K$ once (a proof can be found e.g. here , on page 160). The proof of the above theorem runs roughly as follows Pave the plane with $\varepsilon(\Bbb Z+i\Bbb Z)$ and let $Q_1,\dots,Q_n$ be the finitely many squares of the lattice intersecting $K$ ; by making $\varepsilon$ small enough we can ensure that $Q_i$ are all contained in $U$ . Let $$\delta_i=\gamma_{i1}+\gamma_{i2}+\gamma_{i3}+\gamma_{i4}$$ be the positively oriented boundary of $Q_i$ , let $\Lambda=\sum_i\delta_i$ , and let $\Gamma$ be the sum of those sides $\gamma_j$ that belong to only one $Q_i$ , then $\Gamma$ is a cycle in $U\setminus K$ and $\int_\Gamma f=\int_\Lambda f$ for all $f\in H(U)$ . We then show that the formula holds for $z\in K$ not lying on $\Lambda$ and extend it to all of $K$ by continuity, since both sides of the identity are analytic. I am trying to understand the highlighted part, namely why $\Gamma$ is a cycle (in either sense of the word) and why it must be contained in $U\setminus K$ (if a side of $Q_i$ does not belong to any other square, why should it not intersect $K$ ?). Both statements make intuitive sense to me, however I can't prove them formally. If there are alternative proofs/expositions of this theorem or its aforementioned stronger version, I'd be interested in seeing them.

4914234,Existence of a uniform measure on the group of permutation of $\mathbb N.$,"If $G$ is the group of permutations of $\mathbb N,$ is there a non-trivial probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ such that, when $S\subset G$ is measurable, and $g\in G,$ then $gS=\{gs\mid s\in S\}$ is also measurable and $\mu(S)=\mu(gS).$ By ""non-trivial,"" I am hoping for at least one measurable set which is neither countable nor co-countable. A measurable set with measure strictly between $0$ and $1.$ All of my attempts reduce to finding a uniform probability measure on $\mathbb N,$ which is impossible. In particular, if you treat $G$ as a subset of $\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}$ with the product topology, and treat the basis of your $\sigma$ -algebra as the open sets, then you get $S_{n,m}=\{\pi\in G\mid \pi(n)=m\}$ must all have the same measure, and $\bigcup_m S_{0.m}=G$ is a disjoint union, which is impossible. So we'd need some different $\sigma-$ algebra. If there isn't a probability measure, maybe there is a non-trivial uniform measure with $\mu(\{g\})=0$ for all $g\in G$ ? We'd still need $S_{m,n}$ either unmeasurable or have infinite measure for all $n,m.$ Otherwise, we'd have $$S_{0,0}=\bigcup_{n\geq 1} \left(S_{0,0}\cap S_{1,n}\right)$$ would reach the same contradiction - a uniform probability measure on $\mathbb N.$ Indeed, we'd need any open set from the subspace of the product topology on $\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}$ to be unmeasurable or have infinite measure.","['measure-theory', 'topological-groups', 'probability']"
4914286,Why is this a wrong use of the product rule (for combinatorics) for finding number of onto functions?,"I know the standard formula for finding the number of onto functions (for a function $f: [n] \to [m],$ where $[n] = \{1, ..., n\}$ and $n \ge m$ ) is the one that involves inclusion/exclusion, but I'm not fully sure why using the multiplication rule would be wrong here. In particular, I did $${n\choose m} \cdot m! \cdot m^{n-m}$$ My reason is as follows: ${n\choose m} \cdot m!$ (Part 1): When I first did this part, I was just attempting to ensure that there are a set of elements in the domain that map to all the elements in the codomain, hence ensuring it's onto. However, I think a better way to justify my reasoning (that I just thought of while writing this question) is the intuition that for any onto function there must be a partial function that's bijective (not sure how to formally prove it though), hence this is what this part of my formula attempts to do. $m^{n - m}$ (Part 2): This is just mapping the remaining domain elements to any of the elements in the codomain since we've already ensured the function is onto but still need these elements to map to exactly 1 element in the codomain to still be a function I can see that there's at least one example where this overcounts: f: [8] -> [4] Part 1: choose the domain elements 1, 2, 3, 4 and map them to 1, 2,
3, 4 (respectively) Part 2: map the remaining domain elements 5, 6,
7, 8 to 1, 2, 3, 4 (also respectively) or Part 1: choose the domain elements 5, 6, 7, 8 and map them to 1, 2,
3, 4 (respectively) Part 2: map the remaining domain elements 1, 2,
3, 4 to 1, 2, 3, 4 (also respectively) Both lead to the same function. I think this hits home at a fundamental issue I often struggle with when using the multiplication rule, that is I don't know when to properly use it such that I avoid overcounting. What are the exact conditions in which you're allowed to use the product rule, since textbooks I feel don't give a rigorous enough definition and it leads to such errors for many people. Maybe I'm personally missing something here. Kindly please do help here. Also, is there a way to modify my formula so that it can work?","['functions', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4914291,Evaluating the integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Phi^2\left(\frac{x - a}{b}\right)\phi(x)dx$.,"While it is possible to get a closed-form solution to the integral \begin{align*}
I_1(a, b) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\Phi\left(\frac{x - a}{b}\right)\phi(x)dx = \Phi\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + b^2}}\right),

I_2(a, b) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\Phi\left(\frac{x - a}{b}\right)^2\phi(x)dx
\end{align*} to a closed-form?  The software seems to suggest that it is possible (at least when $a = 0$ ), but how to deduce it theoretically?  When $a = 0$ , I tried writing $I_2(a, b)$ to a triple integration \begin{align*}
\iiint_V (2\pi)^{3/2}\exp(-(x^2 + y^2 + z^2))dxdydz,
\end{align*} where $V = \{(x, y, z): y \leq b^{-1}x, z \leq b^{-1}x\}$ , then using spherical coordinates.  While this may work out (I haven't fully finished off the computation, but the process is quite verbose), I am wondering is there any alternative smarter way? According to this link , \begin{align*}
I_2(a, b) = \Phi\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + b^{2}}}\right) 
-2\phi\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + b^2}}\right)\int_0^{\frac{b}{\sqrt{2 + b^2}}}\frac{\phi\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + b^2}}x\right)}{1 + x^2}dx.
\end{align*} Hence when $a = 0$ , one indeed has the closed-form integral: \begin{align*}
I_2(0, b) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\left(\frac{b}{\sqrt{2 + b^2}}\right).

4914292,"Where is the mistake in the argument in favor of the (erroneous) claim ""every Dedekind cut is a rational cut""?","A cut is a set $C$ such that: (a) $C\subseteq \mathbb Q $ (b) $C \neq \emptyset $ (c) $C \neq \mathbb {Q} $ (d) for all $a, c \in \mathbb Q $ , if $c\in C$ and $a\lt c$ , then $a\in C $ (e) for all $c\in \mathbb Q$ , if $c\in C$ , then there exists $d\gt c$ such that $d\in C$ A rational cut is a cut of the form $C(r) = \{c | c\lt r, r\in \mathbb Q\}$ . I know that the statement ""every cut is a rational cut"" can be disproved by giving a counterexample. However, I can't prevent myself from finding an air of plausibility to the following argument aiming at justifying that every cut is of the form $C(r)$ . Hence my request: can you please show me where the following argument goes wrong? Step 1 : Suppose $C$ is a cut , and that $C$ is not of the form $C(r)$ for some $r \in \mathbb Q$ . This amounts to saying: (1) there is no $r$ such that for all $c$ if $c \in C$ then $c\lt r $ (2) implying that: for all $r$ it is not the case that for all $c$ if $c \in C$ then $c\lt r $ (3) implying that:   for all $ r$ there is some $c$ such that $c\in C$ and $c\geq r $ Step 2: Suppose $r\in \mathbb Q$ and $r\notin C $ . By (3) above there is some $c$ such that: $c\in C$ and $c\geq r$ . Now, if $c=r$ then $r\in C$ . Also, if $c\gt r$ then $ r\lt c$ and, by the ""cut"" definition, $r\in C$ . So the hypothesis $r \notin C$ leads to a contradiction; meaning that $\mathbb  Q\subseteq C$ , since $r$ was arbitrary. Finally we have $C\subset \mathbb Q$ and $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq C$ , a contradiction (since the first statement negates that all rationals belong to $C$ while the second asserts the same proposition). The conclusion seems to be that a Dedekind cut that is not a rational cut is not a Dedekind cut; in other words, every Dedekind cut has to be a rational cut. Note: I can see an objection to the conclusion of ""step 2"", namely that what the argument shows is that the first conjuction is false, namely $r\in \mathbb Q$ . But how to make sense of the negation of this conjunction since the set of rationals is the domain over which range all our number variables (in this argument)?","['real-numbers', 'proof-explanation', 'irrational-numbers', 'fake-proofs', 'real-analysis']"

Given a circle with radius $R$ and $r<R$ What is the least number of circles with radius $r$ is required to cover the circumference of the circle with radius $R$ ?
