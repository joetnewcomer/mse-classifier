1501253,Joint exponential distribution seems ok until I take derivitive,"In studying joint distribution and density functions I have become confused by this exponential distrobution: $$F_{X,Y}(x,y)=(1-e^{-(x+y)})u(x)u(y)$$ It seems this should be a proper distribution as it is: monotonically increasing $F_{X,Y}(0,0)=F_{X,Y}(-\infty,y)=F_{X,Y}(x,-\infty)=F_{X,Y}(-\infty,-\infty)=0$ $F_{X,Y}(\infty,\infty)=1$ $0\le F_{X,Y}(x,y)\le1$ However if I take the partial derivatives with respect to X and Y to derive the density I get a function that is not a valid density: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x \partial y} F_{X,Y}(x,y)=\delta(x) \delta(y)-e^{-(x+y)}u(x)u(y)+e^{-(x+y)}u(x)\delta(y)+e^{-(x+y)}\delta(x)u(y)-e^{-(x+y)}\delta(x)\delta(y)$$ Which basically reduces to $-e^{-(x+y)}u(x)u(y)$ for non-zero values of X and Y.  But this is not a valid density function.  Can anyone offer insight on how I am going astray?","['probability', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'density-function']"
1501263,Finding the closure of sets in different topologies.,"$\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}}
\newcommand{\T}{\mathcal{T}}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$ Problem Let $\T_1$ be the lower limit topology in $\R$ and $\T_{2}$ be the topology generated by basis $\mathcal{C}=\{[a,b)|a<b,a,b\in\Q\}$ . Determine the closures of the intervals $A=(0,\sqrt{2})$ and $B=(\sqrt{2},3)$ in these two topologies. Attempted Solution （I shall use $A'$ to denote the set of limit points of set $A$ ） In $\T_{1}$ , we claim that $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}=[0,\sqrt{2})$ .
To show this, we first show that $\left\{ 0\right\} $ is a limit
point of $\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right).$ Let $U$ be any open set containing
in $\left\{ 0\right\} $ , then $\exists[a,b)$ such that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in[a,b)\subset U.$ Therefore, $\exists\varepsilon>0$ such that $[0,\varepsilon)\in[a,b),$ which implies $U\cap\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)\neq\emptyset$ . Since $U$ is arbitrary, we have that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in\left(0,2\right)'$ .
Then we have $[0,\sqrt{2})\subset\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}.$ To see the other direction, it suffices to show that $[0,\sqrt{2})$ is closed. Indeed, $[0,\sqrt{2})^{c}=\left(-\infty,0\right)\cup[\sqrt{2},+\infty)=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[[-n,0)\cup[\sqrt{2},n)\right]$ which is open and thus $[0,\sqrt{2})$ is closed and contains $\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)$ .
Then by definition, $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}\subset[0,\sqrt{2})$ .
By virtually the same argument, we can show that $\overline{\left(\sqrt{2},3\right)}=[\sqrt{2},3)$ . In $\T_{2}$ , we claim that $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}=\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right].$ Using a similar argument, we can show that $\left\{ 0\right\} \in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ .
To show that $\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} \in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ , we note that for any open set $U$ containing $\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} $ , $\exists[a,b)\in U$ such that $a<b$ and $a,b\in\Q.$ This guarantees
that $a<\sqrt{2}$ since $\sqrt{2}\notin\Q$ . Thus $U\cap\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)\neq\emptyset.$ Since $U$ is arbitrary, $\sqrt{2}\in\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)'$ . We
then have $\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right]\in\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}.$ To see this other direction, it suffices to show that $\left[0,\sqrt{2}\right]$ is closed. To see this, we note that we can rewrite $[0,\sqrt{2}]^{c}=\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[[-n,0)\cup[a_{n},+\infty)\right]$ where $a_{n}\in\Q$ for all $n\in\N,$ and $a_{n}\downarrow\sqrt{2}.$ Notice that the latter is open as it's a countable union of open sets
in $\T_{2}$ , whence $[0,\sqrt{2}]$ is closed, and as a result $\overline{\left(0,\sqrt{2}\right)}\subset[0,\sqrt{2}]$ .
By a similar argument, we can show that $\overline{\left(\sqrt{2},3\right)}=[\sqrt{2},3)$ Question I don't know if my arguments are convincing enough. I hope someone can take a look at my attempt and point out any mistakes and possible improvements.","['proof-verification', 'general-topology']"
1501274,"Not every function on $[0,1]$ is a pointwise limit of continuous functions on $[0,1]$","How to show that not every $\mathbb{R}$-valued function on $[0,1]$ is a pointwise limit of continuous $\mathbb{R}$-valued functions on $[0,1]$?

So we can take, for instance, function $f=\chi([0,1]\cap \mathbb{Q})$ and this would be the function that is not a pointwise limit of continuous functions, according to the theorem. But the theorem is strong, it states more then we need and its proof is rather non-trivial.

Obviously, the quantity to be integrated is just $1 dzdydx$ but I am unsure of what to put for the integrand. I guess the bounds for x would be 0 and 2 and the z is bounded by z=3 and z=0, and y is bounded by the line y=2 and the point $(0,0,0)$ right? Would the integral then be $\int_0^2 {\int_0^2 {\int_0^3 {1dzdydx}}}$ ?

1501323,Why can any union of open intervals be written as union of disjoint open intervals?,"Hi I see many people asked this question,but none of them proved this by considering all possible cases which my professor did. Below is the solution that I have. Show that a union of open intervals can be written as a disjoint union of open intervals. Solution. The whole problem can be reduced to writing the union of two intervals as a union of disjoint ones (in
case we have several, or uncountably many, we do induction). We are given (a, b) and (c, d) and we want to write (a, b) ∪ (c, d) as a union of disjoint intervals. There are three cases that can occur:
• a < b ≤ c < d. Then the two intervals are already disjoint, so we are done.
• a ≤ c < b ≤ d. Then (a, b) ∪ (c, d) = (a, d).
• a ≤ c < d ≤ b. Then (a, b) ∪ (c, d) = (a, b). I am not sure why there are only three cases. Can we have (c,d) and (c,b) as well? so I think there must be 5 cases that we have to consider. Also, I do not understand how I can apply this to show that any union of open intervals can be written as union of disjoint open intervals.

1501363,Geometric proof that $\int_a^c (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)\ dx=0$ if and only if $b$ is the midpoint of $a$ and $c$.,"Let $a<b<c$ be three real numbers, and $f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)$. We want to show that $\int_a^c f(x)\ dx=0$ if and only if $b=\frac{a+c}{2}$. The first move is to horizontally shift $f$ by $b$ units, that is introduce $g(x)=f(x+b)=(x-r_1)x(x+r_2)$ with $r_1<0<r_2$. Then the statement becomes $\int_{r_1}^{r_2} g(x)\ dx=0$ if and only if $r_1=-r_2$. If $r_1=-r_2$, the result is true, since the integrand is odd. For the converse, a not difficult but boring computing shows that the integral is $\frac{(r_1-r_2)^3(r_1+r_2)}{12}$, which means that $r_1=-r_2$ (since $r_1-r_2<0$). This works, but computations does not satisfy me and I have the strong intuition that there could be a more geometric way.

1501818,Hecke characters of imaginary quadratic fields,"Let $K$ be a number field and let $\mathfrak m$ be an integral ideal. Let $I(\mathfrak m)$ be the group of fractional ideals of $K$ coprime with $\mathfrak m$. Let $P(\mathfrak m)$ be the group of principal fractional ideals coprime with $\mathfrak m$. Finally, let $K_{\mathfrak m}$ be the set of elements of $K$ which are coprime with $\mathfrak m$. Recall that there is a map $K\to \mathbb R\otimes K\simeq (\mathbb R)^{r_1}\times (\mathbb C)^{r_2}$ which sends $\alpha\mapsto 1\otimes\alpha$ where $r_1$ (resp. $r_2$) is the number of real (resp. complex) places of $K$. A Hecke character of $K$ of conductor $\mathfrak m$ and infinity type $\chi_{\infty}$ is a homomorphism
$$\chi\colon I(\mathfrak m)\to \mathbb C^*$$
such that there exists a continuous homomorphism
$$\chi_{\infty}\colon (\mathbb R^*)^{r_1}\times (\mathbb C^*)^{r_2}\to \mathbb C^*$$
with the property that
$$\chi((\alpha))=\chi_{\infty}(1\otimes \alpha)^{-1} \text{ for all }\alpha \in K_{\mathfrak m}$$ Now my question is the following: assume that $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field. How do I know that there exist nontrivial Hecke characters on $K$? When $K$ has class number $1$ everything is easy, for example when $K=\mathbb Q(i)\subseteq \mathbb C$ one can just take $\mathfrak m=\mathcal O_K$ and $\chi_n(\alpha)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{|\alpha|}\right)^{4n}$ for $n\in \mathbb Z$. Then $\chi_{n,\infty}(\alpha)=(\alpha/|\alpha|)^{-4n}$ and we're ok. But what happens in the general case? Is it possible to write down explicitely a nontrivial Hecke character? And is it true that given an infinity type $\chi_{\infty}$ there always exist a Hecke character with infinity type $\chi_{\infty}$?","['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

1501834,Show that gravity is described by this 1-form,"From Harold Edwards' Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach , section 2.1, exercise 1: The central force field .  Newton's law of gravitational attraction states that the force exerted by a massive body (the Sun) fixed at the origin $(0,0,0)$ on a particle in space is directed toward the Sun and has magnitude proportional to the inverse square of the distance to the Sun.  Show that this means that the force field is described by the $1$-form $$\frac{kx}{r^3}dx + \frac{ky}{r^3}dy + \frac{kz}{r^3}dz$$ where $k$ is a positive constant and $r=r(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Here's what I've done: I know that work (at least for small displacements) in physics is defined as $W = F_xdx + F_ydy + F_zdz$ where the force is $\vec F = (F_x, F_y, F_z)$. I consider the gravity at a point $(x,y,z)$.  Then first the direction toward the Sun is $-x\hat x -y\hat y -z\hat z$.  So the gravity at this point must be proportional to this. Then I think about the magnitude of $\vec F$ and I get $$\| \vec F\| \propto \frac 1{r^2} \implies {F_x}^2 + {F_y}^2 + {F_z}^2 \propto \frac{1}{r^4}$$ This leads me to think that each component $F_i$ is proportional to $\frac 1{r^2}$. So putting that together I get that $\vec F$ should be proportional to $$\left(\frac{-x}{r^2},\frac{-y}{r^2},\frac{-z}{r^2}\right)$$ But this problem states that it should be proportional to $$\left(\frac{x}{r^3},\frac{y}{r^3},\frac{z}{r^3}\right)$$ Where have I gone wrong?","['physics', 'multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms']"

But the article goes on to say that this is equivalent to the geometric fibers being smooth varieties, which I don't agree with: varieties are separated but nothing in the first definition rules out the fibers being non-separated. Indeed the affine line with two origins is locally the usual affine line, so I want it to be smooth. This issue comes up in Vakil's notes too: in theorem 25.2.2, the following definitions are claimed to be equivalent: (ii) a smooth morphism is lft, flat of relative dimension n, and the sheaf of relative differentials is locally free of rank n (iii/iv) a smooth morphism is lft and flat with (geometric) fibers smooth (in the sense of the Jacobian criterion) varieties of dimension n.

Is $B(S)$ a complete metric space? If not, then can we impose any conditions on $S$ under which $B(S)$ does become complete? My effort: Let $(x_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $B(S)$. Then, given $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that 
$$d(x_m, x_n) < \epsilon \ \mbox{ for all natural numbers } \ m \ \mbox{ and } \ n \ \mbox{ such that } \ m > N \ \mbox{ and } \ n>N. $$

     $$(b) \ \forall x\in E, \text{ we have that } \phi_n(x) \rightarrow f(x), \text{ as }n \rightarrow \infty$$ Proof: Notice that for each positive integer $n$ and each real number $t$ corresponds a unique integer $k = k_n(t)$ that satisfies
$k2^{-n} \leq t < (k+1)2^{-n}$. Define:
$$ s_n(t) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
 k_n(t)2^{-n} & 0 \leq t < n\\ n & n \leq t \leq \infty

Note that each $s_n$ is a borel function on $[0,\infty]$. In other words, for any open set $V$, $s_n^{-1}(V)$ is a borel set. Now,
$$k2^{-n} \leq t  < (k+1)2^{-n}  \Rightarrow t - 2^{-n} < s_n(t) \leq t \text{ if } 0 \leq t\leq n,$$
thus, $0 \leq s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \cdots \leq t,$ and $s_n(t) \rightarrow t$ as $n \rightarrow \infty,$ for every $t\in [0,\infty]$. It follows that the function $\phi_n = s_n\circ f$ satisfy (a) and (b); since $f$ is measurable and $s_n$ is a borel function, then $\phi_n$ is also measurable. To obtain a decreasing function, let $\psi_n = -s_n(-f)$, thus $\phi_n$ and $\psi_n$ are steps functions, $ \phi_n \leq f\leq \psi_n$ and $\psi_n-\phi_n \leq 2^{-n}$ for every integer $n$. My question is how I can obtain uniform convergence? I know that from what i proved, I didn't needed to assume that $f$ is bounded. The following theorem might be useful, namely Dini's Theorem(obtained from wikipedia). If $Y$ is a compact topological space, and $\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a monotonically increasing sequence (meaning $f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $n$ and $x$) of continuous real-valued functions on $X$ which converges pointwise to a continuous function $f$, then the convergence is uniform. The same conclusion holds if $\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is monotonically decreasing instead of increasing. Is there a way to use this theorem under the assumption that $f$ is bounded to obtain uniform convergence?","['lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

From the axioms of topology, it follows that $\Omega \subset \tau_m$ . It therefore suffices to prove that $\Omega$ is a topology. But this follows from the equalities $$\bigcup_{\alpha \in A}  \left( \bigcup_{\beta \in B_{\alpha}} \left( \bigcap_{i \in I_{n(\alpha, \beta)}} U_{\alpha,\beta,i}\right) \right) = \bigcup_{\beta \in \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} B_{\alpha}} \left( \bigcap_{i \in I_{n(\alpha, \beta)}} U_{\alpha,\beta,i} \right)  ,$$ $$ \left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} \left( \bigcap_{i \in I_{n(\alpha)}} U_{\alpha,i}\right) \right) \cap \left( \bigcup_{\beta \in B} \left( \bigcap_{j \in I_{n(\beta)}} U_{\beta,j}\right) \right) = \bigcup_{(\alpha,\beta) \in A \times B} \left( \bigcap_{\xi \in  \bigsqcup_{\omega \in \{\alpha,\beta \} } I_{n(\omega)}} U_{\xi} \right).$$ I think that my notation got overloaded.

Prove that $(\tilde{M},\tilde{g})$ is complete. My thoughts: $\pi:\tilde{M}\to M$ is a local isometry. It suffices to prove that $\tilde{M}$ satisfies one of the hypotheses of Hopf-Rinow, and then we're done. My idea was to show that all geodesics on $\tilde{M}$ can be defined forever using a path-lifting argument. So if we have a geodesic for some $p\in M, V\in T_pM$, namely $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\to M$, take a fixed $q\in \pi^{-1}(p)$ and $X\in T_q\tilde{M}$ such that $d\pi_q(X)=V$ (since it is a local diffeomorphism), and let $\delta:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to \tilde{M}$ be a geodesic for $q,X$. Moreover, $\pi\circ \delta=\gamma$ at least on a small interval, because they have the same initial point and same initial derivative. Now, we can lift $\gamma$ to $\tilde{\gamma}:\mathbb{R}\to \tilde{M}$ starting at $q$. We have that $\pi\circ \tilde{\gamma}=\gamma$.By uniqueness, on a small interval, $\tilde{\gamma}=\delta$. Thus the geodesic $\delta$ can be extended to a map $\tilde{\gamma}:\mathbb{R}\to\tilde{M}$. Since this was arbitrary, $\tilde{M}$ is geodesically complete. Does this work?

I know that the idea is to put this into a quotient, but if I do the following: $$-x+5\cdot ln(x) = \frac{-x^2}{x}+\frac{5x\cdot ln(x)}{x} = \frac{-x^2 + 5x\cdot ln(x)}{x}$$ And then try to take the limit, I get a doubly indeterminate form of $\frac{-\infty+\infty}{\infty}$, and using L'Hopitals rule here just ends back inthe same kind of indeterminate difference.","['calculus', 'limits']"

1503195,"Is [0,1] in R totally bounded?","Although the concept of boundedness is quite understandable, I am struggling with the concept of total boundedness. 
If I understand properly, then the metric space $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ with the ordinary distance $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ is not totally bounded. This because I cannot find a finite union of balls of radius $\varepsilon$, with $\varepsilon$ that can be arbitrary small, that ""covers"" $[0,1]$. 
For example, for $\varepsilon = 0.5$ I can find a finite number of balls to cover $ [0,1]$ (for instance, two balls are enough), for $\varepsilon = 0.2$ I need e.g. five balls, etc. But for arbitrary small $\varepsilon$ I would need an infinite number of balls, and therefore the defined metric space is not totally bounded. Is that reasoning correct?

1503338,Understanding axioms of neighbourhoods in topological spaces,"Let $X$ be a set of points, along with a certain function $N$ that assigns a subset to every $x \in X.$ Then $X$ together with $N$ define a topological space if $N$ satisfies the following axioms: (quoting below from wikipedia ) If $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ (i.e., $N \in N(x)$), then $x \in N$. In other words, each point belongs to every one of its neighbourhoods. If $N$ is a subset of $X$ and contains a neighbourhood of $x$, then $N$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. I.e., every superset of a neighbourhood of a
  point $x$ in $X$ is again a neighbourhood of $x$. The intersection of two neighbourhoods of $x$ is a neighbourhood of $x$. Any neighbourhood $N$ of $x$ contains a neighbourhood $M$ of $x$ such that $N$ is a neighbourhood of each point of $M$. Questions: My first struggle is with the statement of the second axiom, namely that any superset $S\supseteq M$ of a neighbourhood $M$ of $x$ is again a neighbourhood of $x$. a) Doesn't this mean that everything is a neighbourhood of everything because I can just set $S=X$? But then what good $N$ is at characterizing $X$ in terms of specific subsets of every $x$, if any neighbourhood can be indefinitely enlarged? b) How to understand the need for such an axiom? Am I right to interpret the 4th axiom as follows: Given a neighbourhood $N$ of $x,$ it is always possible to extract a smaller neighbourhood $M'\subseteq M$  from $M,$ such that $M'$ is an open subset, where $M$ need not be open itself.

Show that there are sequences of simple functions on $E$, $\{\varphi_{n}\}$ and $\{\psi_{n}\}$ such that $\{\varphi_{n}\}$ is increasing, $\{\psi_{n}\}$ is decreasing, and each of these sequences converge to $f$ uniformly on $E$. In order to approach this problem, I was given the hint of using the Simple Approximation Lemma.  This Lemma guarantees to us the existence of an increasing sequence $\{\gamma_{n}\}$ that converges pointwise to $f$ on $E$. Then, and this is the first part of my question: Since $f$ is bounded, we have $|f(x)|\leq M$ $\forall x$. So, the function $f+M$ is both bounded and measurable, and we are given that $\{\gamma_{n}\}$ converges pointwise to $f$, and is increasing. Now, can we then let $\varphi_{n} = \gamma_{n} - M$, where $\{\varphi_{n} \}$ is a sequence that increases pointwise to $f$? And for another sequence $\{\eta_{n}\}$ increasing pointwise to $f$, can we let $\psi_{n} = -\eta_{n} $, and have $\{\psi_{n}\}$ be a sequence decreasing to $f$? The second part of my question is: once I have my two sequences converging pointwise, how do I show that they converge uniformly?

This produces an extended field F , which consists of everything that one can produce from this root and from elements of F using addition and multiplication.' The whole thing makes no sense. Specifically the part ""one can produce from this root"". What is production from roots? Very confusing. I thought this must be because I don't fundamentally understand roots.

must be better determined theoretically than empirically. To account for this universality but for
magnitude, he visualized not a single distribution for the voltage at any given time, but a hierarchy
of distributions $p(v|\sigma)$ characterized by a single scale parameter $\sigma^2$, which we shall take to be the
expected square of the noise voltage. The stability seems to imply that if the noise level $\sigma^2$ is
increased by adding a small increment of voltage, the probability distribution still has the same
functional form, but only moved up the hierarchy to the new value of $\sigma$. He discovered that for
only one functional form of $p(v|\sigma)$ will this be true. Suppose the noise voltage $v$ is assigned the probability distribution $p(v|\sigma)$. Then it is incremented by a small extra contribution $\epsilon$, becoming $v' = v + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is small compared to $\sigma$, and
has a probability distribution $q(\epsilon)d\epsilon$, independent of $p(v|\sigma)$. Given a specic $\epsilon$, the probability for
the new noise voltage to have the value $v'$ would be just the previous probability that $v$ should have the value $(v' - \epsilon)$. Questions: What exactly is the Landon invariance property?
