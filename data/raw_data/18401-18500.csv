152648,Application of Riemann-Roch,"The Riemann-Roch theorem states $l(D)-l(K-D)=1 + deg(D) - g$ where $D$ is a divisor on a compact Riemann surface $X$ and $K$ is the divisor of meromorphic 1-form. In the case $g=2$ and $D=K$ this is $l(K)=2$. So the space of holomorphic 1-forms has dimension 2. Call $\omega_1, \omega_2$ a basis for this space. I don't understand why $\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}$ should be a ramified covering space $X \longrightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ (this is what I wrote in my notes) and why every surface of genus 2 is double covering space of $\mathbb{P}^1$ ramified in 6 points.

152655,A well-known sines limit,"The following question is related to the answer i've found for this limit and i like to know if it's valid. I need to find the following limit: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow0} \frac{\sin(kx)}{x} $$
where k is a fixed positive integer. Proof: Here we'are going to appeal to a very well known inequality: $$ \sin(x) < x < \tan(x),\space 0<x<\frac{\pi}{2}$$ Then we have that: $$ \sin(kx) < kx < \tan(kx),\space 0<x<\frac{\pi}{2k}$$ From the above inequality we get that: 
$$\cos(kx) < \frac{\sin(kx)}{kx}< 1$$
After multiplying the inequality by k and taking the limit when x goes to ${0}$ we get that: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow0}\space k\cos(kx) < \lim_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{\sin(kx)}{x}< k$$ By Squeeze Theorem the limit is $k$. For such an answer i received a downvote because in the last inequality i used $""<""$ instead of $""\leq""$. I'd like to know your opinion and if i'm wrong then i want to correct it.

152666,"Is $\operatorname{Homeo}([0,1])$ Weil-Complete?","After learning about uniformities on topological groups, we were given several sources to read. I came across the term ""Weil-complete."" A topological group is Weil-complete if it is complete with respect to the left (or right) uniformity. We learned that the sets $\{(x,y) \in G \times G : x^{-1}y \in U \}$, where $U$ is neighborhood of the neutral element, form a base of entourages for the left uniformity (similarly the sets $\{(x,y) \in G \times G : yx^{-1} \in U \}$ form a base of entourages for the right uniformity). If $G$ is the group $\operatorname{Homeo}([0,1])$ of all self-homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$, and it is equipped with the topology of uniform convergence, would $G$ be Weil-complete? I've been looking at this for quite some time, but haven't been able to make any progress. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","['general-topology', 'topological-groups', 'uniform-spaces']"
152680,Extending a homeomorphism of a subset of a space to a $G_\delta$ set,"I am having trouble figuring out the following question (3.10 in Kechris, Classical Descriptive Set Theory): If $X$ is completely metrizable, and $A\subseteq X$ with $f:A\to A$ a homeomorphism, then there is a $G_\delta$ set $G\subseteq X$ containing $A$ and an extension $h:G\to G$ of $f$ which is a homeomorphism of $G$. Lavrentiev's Theorem gets us $G_\delta$ sets $G'$ and $H'$ containing $A$, and a homeomophism $g:G'\to H'$ extending $f$, but it doesn't seem to me that the proof of that result can be easily adapted to make $G'=H'$. The key fact in all of this is the set $\bar{A}\cap\{x:\mathrm{osc}_f(x)=0\}$, for any continuous $f:A\to X$, is a $G_\delta$ set in $X$ on which we can continuously extend $f$.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'descriptive-set-theory']"
152683,Continuous and Open maps,"I was reading through Munkres' Topology and in the section on Continuous Functions, these three statements came up: If a function is continuous, open, and bijective, it is a homeomorphism. If a function is continuous, open, and injective, it is an imbedding. If a function is continuous, open, and surjective, it is a quotient map. (This one isn't a definition, but it is a particular example.) So then I wondered: is there was a name for functions that are just continuous and open without being 1-1 or onto?  Are these special at all? Or does dropping the set theoretic restrictions give us a class of functions that just isn't very nice. EDIT: This question is not asking if continuous implies open or vice versa. I know we can have one of them, both, or neither.  The question is about if we suppose we have both of them, but our function isn't 1-1 or onto, what can we say about this function.

152687,Definition of Willmore energy,"The MAA has posted to its facebook page a link to an article about a recent proposed proof of what is called the Willmore conjecture, after Thomas Willmore. Wikipedia's article titled Wilmore conjecture includes the following: Let $v:M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ be a smooth immersion of a compact, orientable surface (of dimension two).  Giving $M$ the Riemannian metric induced by $v$, let $H:M\to\mathbb{R}$ be the mean curvature (the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ at each point).  Let $K$ be the Gaussian curvature.  In this notation, the Willmore energy $W(M)$ of $M$ is given by
    $$W(M) = \int_S H^2 \, dA - \int_S K \, dA.$$
    In the case of the torus, the second integral above is zero. A little bit of this came from editing by me within the past hour. Knowing very little of differential geometry, I hesitate to do much more with this paragraph before clarifying some things.  It seems $M$ is a particular parametrization of the surface, but the integrals look like things that should not depend on which suitably well-behaved parametrization is chosen.  Yet the definition seems to attribute the Willmore energy to the parametrization $M$, rather than to the surface, which might be parametrized in any of many different ways.  Notice the use of the capital letter $S$ in the expression $\displaystyle\int_S$, when nothing called $S$ was defined!  Presumably $S$ means the image of $M$. Ought one to write $W(S)$ instead of $W(M)$, to be clear about a lack of dependence on a choice of parametrization?",['differential-geometry']
152698,Winding number question.,"In class we defined the winding number as follows: If $\gamma$ is a loop on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that does not pass through a point $p$, the winding number $W( \gamma, p)$ is an integer $n$ that $\gamma$ represents $n$ times the canonical generator in the fundamental group $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{p\})$. Essentially, it is thought of as the number of turns $\gamma$ makes about $p$. I've been working on problems to better my understanding of this topic. I can't figure out this one, and was wondering if anyone could help me out? Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct points on the plane and $X = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{p, q\}$. If $\gamma$ is a loop in $X$ such that $W(\gamma, p) = W(\gamma, q) = 0$, does it follow that $\gamma$ represents the trivial element of the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$?

If you are given the sample variance as $$ S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \bar{X}\right)^2 $$ How can you write the following? $$ S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \mu\right)^2 - n\left(\mu - \bar{X}\right)^2\right] $$ All texts that cover this just skip the details but I can't work it out myself. I get stuck after expanding like so $$ S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(X_i^2 -2X_i\bar{X} + \bar{X}^2\right) $$ What am I missing? Edit: A similarly equivalent expression is often given that I also can't derive but which may be more obvious is $$  S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n\bar{X}^2\right] $$","['statistics', 'probability-theory']"

Attempt: Let $O$ be the set of open intervals of the form $(-1/2, 1-1/t)$ . $O$ is an open cover but it does not admit a finite subcover. My question is related with understanding of how can  we say $O$ doesn't admit a finite subcover. I find it difficult to apply the open covering definition of compactness.

152806,Random binary invertible matrix,"For implementation of McEliece cryptosystem, I'm trying to generate a random binary invertible matrix and its inverse. Because this is usually the most time-consuming part of generating a McEliece keypair (matrix size is usually around $2^{13}\times2^{13}$), I'm searching for ways to do it faster. So far, I've tried to use following approaches: Generate an upper triangular matrix $U$ with random ones and zeroes in the upper triangle, and ones on diagonal (such $U$ is invertible), symmetrically generate $L$ lower triangular matrix, compute $M = UL$ and invert M by standard inversion. This is slow. Compute $M = UL$ and $M^{-1} = L^{-1}U^{-1}$. In this case, the inversion is a lot faster (there's no need to compute full row operations, as the inverse remains lower/upper triangular shape), but still slow. Have two identity matrices $I_1,I_2$, perform a number of random row operations on $I_1$, and symetrically perform those inverse row operations on $I_2$, so that equation $I_1^{-1} = I_2$ holds. I'm not sure what number of row operations should be done on the matrices so that the result would be completely random -- my best guess is that $n^2$ operations should be sufficient, giving algorithm complexity $O(n^3)$. If there was some lower limit so that the matrix would be random-enough, this approach could be the fastest. Questions are: Is there some better algorithm, or is the $O(n^3)$ bound impossible to break? What is the lowest possible count of operations in the third algorithm so that the matrix gets undistinguishable from a random matrix from the first algorithm?

152894,$u''+\frac{4}{x+1}u'+\frac{2}{\left(x+1\right)^{2}}u=0$ variational solution,"This is a concept solution scheme derived from a particular example that I have not been able to generalise sufficiently. The objective is to find a particular solution to a certain second-order equation. Rewrite the equation in the self-adjoint form:
$$2\left(\left(x+1\right)^4u'\right)'+4(x+1)^2u=0$$
$$\left(Pu'\right)'-Qu=0 \qquad (1)$$
where
$$P(x)=2\left(x+1\right)^4$$
$$Q(x)=4\left(x+1\right)^2.$$
Now (1) can be interpreted as the Jacobi equation for a certain variational problem
$$S[y]=\int_a^b F\left(x,y,y'\right)dx \to \min, \qquad y(a)=A, y(b)=B$$
so that
$$P(x) = \left. \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial y'^2} \right|_{y=y_0(x)}$$
$$Q(x) = \left. \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial y^2}\right|_{y=y_0(x)}-\left.\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial y\partial y'}\right|_{y=y_0(x)}$$
where $y_0(x)$ is a solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the same functional.
Suppose we have figured out that for the given example:
$$F=\frac{y^2}{y'^4}.$$
Consider the following problem
$$S[y]=\int_0^1\frac{y^2}{y'^4}dx, \qquad y(0)=1,y(1)=\frac{1}{2}$$
for which the given equation will be a Jacobi one. Now it is easy to write out the Euler-Lagrange equation. In fact we can write the first integral straightaway, since $F$ does not depend on $x$:
$$y'F_{y'}-F=C$$
$$y'\frac{2y'}{y^{4}}-\frac{y'^{2}}{y^{4}}=C^{2}$$
$$\frac{y'}{y^{2}}=C$$
$$-\frac{1}{y}=Cx+C_{0}$$
Applying boundary condition $y(0)=1$ we obtain a family of solutions:
$$y(x,C)=\frac{1}{Cx+1}$$
Now a solution of the Jacobi equation is really an envelope of the family of solutions of Euler-Lagrange equation and can be found by differentiating with respect to parameter $C$:
$$u(x)=\frac{\partial y(x,C)}{\partial C}=-\frac{x}{\left(Cx+1\right)^{2}}$$
Finally setting $C=1$ by virtue of the boundary conditions:
$$u(x)=-\frac{x}{\left(x+1\right)^{2}}$$
It can be verified by direct substitution that the above function is a solution of the subject equation. Since the equation is of the second order, the process of constructing a general solution from here is straightforward. Now my concern is: does there exist a way to work backwards from the expressions of $P$ and $Q$ to the function $F$? If this is accomplished then this might result in another indirect method of solving a certain class of second-order ODE. If however, this requires too much pre-knowledge about the solutions of E-L, then this example is bound to remain a case of reverse-engineering.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus-of-variations']"

152944,"What can we say about functions satisfying $f(a + b) = f(a)f(b) $ for all $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Is there a name for such kind of function? I am investigating functions satisfying the exponentiation identity $f(a + b) = f(a)f(b)$ for all $a,b\in \Bbb R$. This is satisfied by $f(x) = \exp(A x)$ but what other functions are possible, if any? What properties must such functions have? This is what I have figured out so far - I am interested in any other properties that are required. $f(0) \in \{0,1\}$ Proof: $f(0) = f(0 + 0) = f(0)f(0) \implies$ either $f(0) = 0$ or dividing by $f(0)$ gives $f(0) = 1$ $f(x)$ is strictly positive everywhere or zero everywhere Proof: If $f(0) = 0$, then $f(x) = f(x+0) = f(x)f(0) = f(x) \cdot 0 = 0$ for all $x$ If $f(0) = 1$ then first we show that $f(x)$ is non zero for all $x$:
$$1 = f(0) = f(x - x) = f(x)f(-x)$$ which implies that both $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ can not be zero and this is true for all $x$. $$f(x) = f(x/2 + x/2) = f(x/2)^2$$  but we already know that $f(x/2)$ is non zero, hence its square is strictly positive. Corollary: $f(-x) = 1/f(x)$ if $f(x)$ is non-zero. For the rest of this question lets assume the non-trivial case where $f(x)$ is strictly positive. $f(p/q) = f(1)^{p/q}$ for all $p/q \in \Bbb Q$ Proof: We have $$f(1/q) ^ q = \underbrace{f(1/q)\cdots f(1/q)}_{q \text{ times }} = f(q/q) = f(1)$$ so taking the $q^{\text{th}}$ root, $f(1/q) = f(1)^{1/q}$.
$$f(px) = \underbrace{f(x)\cdots f(x)}_{p \text{ times }} = f(x)^p$$
Combining these we get the result. Setting $A = \log(f(1))$ we see that $f(x) = \exp(A_t x)$ where $x = p/q \in \Bbb Q$. But what about $x \in \Bbb R - \Bbb Q$ (irrational values of $x$)? If $f$ is required to be continuous, then by the density of $\Bbb Q$ in $\Bbb R$, $f(x) = \exp(A_t x)$ everywhere. But if $f$ is not required to be continuous then I think I can define
$f(x) = \exp(A_t x)$ where $x$ in $\Bbb Q$ where $t$ in some coset $\Bbb R / \Bbb Q$ and $t \Bbb Q = {t + q \text{ where } q\in \Bbb Q}$ and $A_t$ is different for each coset. This makes for quite an interesting function.  (FYI The cosets of $\Bbb R / \Bbb Q$ are discussed in this question What do the cosets of $\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Q}$ look like? ) I am pretty sure in this case that $f(x)$ is not Lesbesque integrable.

So far my thoughts have led me to the following: If $E=K$, then clearly $E/K$ is Galois and $Gal(E/K)=Aut(K/K)=i$, where $i$ is the identity automorphism, so it is trivially cyclic. Assume $[E:K]=n$ for some $n>1$. Since $E/K$ is a finite extension, it is algebraic. Note that if $\beta \in E\setminus F$ then we have the minimal polynomial $m_{\beta}(X)$ over $K[x]$. Since $K$ is fixed by $g$, we know that $g(\beta)$ is also a root of $m_{\beta}(X)$. We can also conclude that $g(\beta)\not \in K$ since $\beta \not \in K$.

Let $\alpha \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$, then $\alpha : G \rightarrow G$ with $g \mapsto g^i$ where $(i,n) = 1$. Let $K \leq G$, then $K$ is cyclic with $K = \langle g^k \rangle$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. $$\alpha (K) = \alpha ( \langle g^k\rangle ) = \langle \alpha(g)^k \rangle = \langle (g^i)^k \rangle = \langle (g^k)^i \rangle =: H.$$ Obviously $H\leq K$. Pick an arbritrary element in $K$, $(g^k)^j$ say $(g^j) = (g^i)^{j'}$ for some $j'$ as $g^i$ generates $G$.

However I would like to know what conditions a given cubic, or even a conic, must satisfy, e.g.,  what are necessary and sufficient conditions for a curve $f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ with $a\neq 0$? How many integer points are required so that we know the curve has infinitely many integer points?","['functions', 'conic-sections', 'real-analysis', 'number-theory']"
153109,How to prove that $p-1$ is squarefree infinitely often?,"How to prove that $p-1$ is squarefree infinitely often, where $p$ is prime? I had thought of using Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.  The number of squareful values of $p-1$ less than or equal to $n$ is bounded by $\sum_{q}{\pi_{q^2,1}(n)}$, each term $\pi_{q^2,1}(n) \approx \frac{\pi(n)}{q \cdot (q-1)}$, and $\sum_{q}{\frac{1}{q \cdot (q-1)}} \lt 1$.  But using for example this statement of Dirichlet's theorem , the possibility is open that the error in each approximation for $\pi_{q^2,1}(n)$ may continue to increase with $q$, and since the sum runs up to $\sqrt{n}$, this argument is invalid. Is there a more refined version of Dirichlet's theorem that can be used to circumvent this issue?  Or an entirely different way to prove this statement?",['number-theory']

This question is not about mathematics, within the scope defined in the help center . Closed 5 years ago . Improve this question I am really curious about the Vedanta behind the arithmetic operations on irrational numbers. It still got aggrevated after the productive discussions with my friend. So I decided to ask it here. 
Basically there is some confusion with some 4 operators. Let me start with $+$ operator. There is no confusion. Suppose the ""$+$"" in $\sqrt{3} +\sqrt{2}$ just add the decimal part of the both numbers. Its like adding $ 1+0.73205... + 1 +0.41421... $ . So it makes sense when we add them linearly . The problem arises with the multiplication. Can some one explain how is $\sqrt{3}*\sqrt{3} = 3$ ?. How can a product of two irrational numbers turns out to be a rational number ? . Its like $1.73205.....*1.73205.....$ , so the multiplication operator just multiplies the decimal part too. It must give rise to the infinite decimal part in the output too. But in converse we are getting a rational number ( specifically an integer ) $3$. How can one make sense out of this contradiction ? . Similarly coming to Division the same problem arises . But once we have well defined multiplication, division may make some sense because we can always rationalize numerator and denominator. So the problem is just finding the explanation behind the multiplication. Similarly how about the exponents ? . Raising an irrational number to the power of another irrational number ? . For example take $\sqrt{3}^{\sqrt{2}}$ . How can one raise the irrational number which has infinite precision to another number which has infinite precision ? . Thank you.

153208,Counting number of $k$-sequences,"I am studying a special type of a sequence on the naturals which I am calling a weak arithmetic progression. Formally I call a k-sequence $x_1<x_2<\cdots< x_k$ a weak arithmetic progression (WAP) if $\exists d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{i+1}-x_i\in\{1,d\}$. Now given two natural numbers $n\ge k\ge 1$, I wish to count the number of WAP's of length k within $\{1,2,3\ldots, n\}$, i.e. the number of WAP's of length k where each WAP consists of elements from $\{1,2\cdots n\}$. This is how I am reasoning: First fix a $d$. Consider any collection of $k$ numbers (as yet identified as $x_1,\cdots x_k$) and write them with spaces in the middle. We will count in how many ways we can put either $d$ or $1$ in the $k-1$ spaces or gaps between these numbers. Now if all the $k-1$ gaps between the numbers have to be filled up by $d$, then the first element of the $k$-WAP can be chosen in $n-(k-1)d$ ways. I will refer to this as $(n-(k-1)d)\tbinom{k-1}{0}$. If all but one of the gaps between the numbers have to be filled up by $d$, then there are $(n-(k-2)d-1)\tbinom{k-1}{1}$ ways, the binomial coefficient indicating where to place the number $1$ in the $k-1$ gaps. Likewise for all but $r$ gaps being filled up by $d$ there would be $(n-(k-r-1)d-r)\tbinom{k-1}{r}$ ways and so for a fixed $d$ there are $\sum_{r=0}^{k-1}(n-(k-r-1)d-r)\tbinom{k-1}{r}=(n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}$ $k$-WAPs. Now to get the total number of $k$-WAPs I sum over $d$ from $2$ to $n-k+1$, i.e. $\sum_{d=2}^{n-k+1}\Big ((n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}\Big )$ and furthermore since double counting of consecutive k-terms occurs for each $d$ in this sum, we subtract $(n-k+1)(n-k-1)$, i.e the final answer is $\sum_{d=2}^{n-k+1}\Big((n-d(k-1))2^{k-1}+(d-1)(k-1)2^{k-2}\Big )-(n-k-1)(n-k+1)$.

Moreover, $M$ is some effective divisor such that $|M|$ is base point free - corresponding to the mobile part of $|nK_S|$ for some $n$ such that the $n$-th plurigenus is at least $2$ - and $K \cdot M = 0$ where $K$ is the canonical divisor.)

After each minute, they choose randomly another room which must be adjacent to it ; i.e. if you are at coordinate $(h,j)$, you can go to $(h \pm 1, j)$ or to $(h, j \pm 1)$ with probability $1/4$, but the probability goes to $1/3$ if you are on a ""side"" (i.e. at coordinate $(1,j)$ you go to $(2,j)$ or $(1, j \pm 1)$ with probability $1/3$, and at coordinate $(1,1)$ you go to $(2,1)$ or $(1,2)$ with probability $1/2$).

For $H=2$ and $J=1$ (or the opposite) and $h_0 = H$, the probability is zero, since the two persons will just switch rooms and leave, without meeting (the hallways don't count :P). So it seems that it depends a lot on $H$ and $J$. Actually, if $H = 1$ and $J \ge 1$ then the probability is $1$ if $j_0$ is odd and $0$ if $j_0$ is even, because then the number of rooms between the two is always even, so for this number to reach $0$ we must have $j_0$ odd. Conversely, if $j_0$ is odd then since the two persons are forced to cross the same rooms they must meet at some point. The same goes by symmetry if $J = 1$. Obviously it cannot only depend on the parity of $H$ and $J$ ; when $H$ and $J$ are not $1$ there always exists paths where the two persons meet and don't meet.

Smoothness might get messed up by the generic fibre, but what about projectiveness? Is $X\to \mathrm{Spec} R$ projective?","['arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'projective-schemes']"

153369,Do Neron models of hyperbolic curves exist,"Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected curve over a number field $K$. Assume that $g\geq 2$. Does there exist a Neron model $\mathcal X$ for $X$ over $O_K$? By a Neron model, I mean a smooth model (not necessarily proper) with the ""Neron universal property"": for any smooth $O_K$-scheme $\mathcal Y$, $$\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal Y, \mathcal X) = X(Y_K).$$ Is the smooth locus of the minimal regular model of $X$ over $O_K$ a Neron model? Does base change help? That is, does there exist a Neron model for $X_L$ after some suitable base change $L/K$? I'm also interested in knowing if we can just have the nice property $\mathcal{X}(O_K) = X(K)$ for some smooth model $\mathcal X$ of $X$. Of course, all of this stuff is clear if $X$ has good reduction over $O_K$.

153376,"""Antisymmetry"" among cut points","We might define a ternary relation between points of a topological space $X$ by writing $x|yz$ whenever $y$ is not in the same quasi-component of $X\setminus \{x\}$ as $z$. It is not hard to prove that if $X$ is connected, at most one of $x|yz$, $y|xz$ and $z|xy$ is true for distinct $x, y, z$. Informally, at most one of the points can be ""between"" the other two. What I can't figure out is whether this still holds if quasi-components are replaced by real components. If it did, I think it would simplify the answer to the question Is the configuration space of a connected space connected? Any help would be appreciated. Addendum: For comparison, here is the proof I had in mind for the
case of quasi-components. Clearly $x|yz$ is symmetric w.r.t. $y$ and $z$,
so it suffices to prove that if $x|yz$ and $y|xz$ for distinct $x, y, z \in X$,
  then $X$ is disconnected. If $x|yz$ then there is a clopen neighbourhood $U$ of $z$ in
$X \setminus \{x\}$ that does not include $y$.
This means that one of $U$ and $U \cup \{x\}$ must be open in
$X$ and one must be closed. Similarly, if $y|xz$ there must be a set $V$ that
includes $z$ but not $x$, such that one of $V$ and $V \cup \{y\}$ is open
and one is closed. Since $y \notin U \cup \{x\}$ and $x \notin V \cup \{y\}$ we have
$$
  (U \cup \{x\}) \cap (V \cup \{y\}) = (U \cup \{x\}) \cap V =
  U \cap (V \cup \{y\}) = U \cap V
$$
Thus $U \cap V$ is always the intersection of two open sets and the
intersection of two
closed sets, therefore it is clopen, and since it contains $z$ but not
$x$ it shows that $X$ is disconnected. $\square$ The analogous statement about path-components in a path-connected space
is also not hard to prove. This statement is equivalent to For distinct points $x, y, z$ in a path-connected space $X$, there is
  a path from $z$ to $x$ that does not pass through $y$, or a path from
  $z$ to $y$ that does not pass through $x$. Let $f: [0,1] \to X$ be any path from $z$ to $x$. Consider the path
$$
  g(t) = \cases{
    y, & if $y \in f([0, t])$  \cr
    f(t), & otherwise.  \cr
  }
$$
If $g(a) = x$ for some $a \in (0,1]$. then
$h: [0,1] \to X: t \mapsto g(t/a)$ is a path from $z$ to $x$ that doesn't
pass through $y$. If not then $g$ is a path from $z$ to $y$ that
doesn't pass through $x$. $\square$","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
153381,Estimates on conjugacy classes of a finite group.,"In Character Theory Of Finite Groups by I Martin Issacs as exercise 2.18, on page 32. Theorem : Let $A$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ such that $A$ is the centralizer of every non-trivial element in $A$. If further $G/A$ is abelian, then $G$ has |G:A| linear characters, and $(|A|-1)/|G:A|$ non-linear irreducible characters of degree =|G:A| which vanish off $A$. My Attempt : By the hypotheses, every conjugacy class contained in $A$ has order=|G:A|, except the trivial one. Moreover, we find that if $C$ is a class which contains one element in  $\alpha A$, then $C$ is contained in $\alpha A$. Let $A$ act on $C$ by conjugation and partition $C$ into orbits. Again we find that no element in $C$ is fixed by $A$, so that |C| is greater than |A|, thus k=the number of classes in $G$ is $\le 1+(|A|-1)/|G:A|+(|G|-|A|)/|A|$. On the other hand, as $G' \subset A$, we find that the number of linear characters is $\ge |G:A|$. Furthermore, by Mackey's irreducibility criterion, there are exactly (|A|-1)/|G:A| irreducible characters induced by linear ones of $A$. Therefore, we conclude as stated. As is obvious, this approach, if correct, exploits properties of induced characters of Mackey, with which I am still not so familiar, and hence I might ask: I: Is my try valid?

153410,Intermediate fields of cyclotomic splitting fields and the polynomials they split,Consider the splitting field $K$ over $\mathbb Q$ of the cyclotomic polynomial $f(x)=1+x+x^2 +x^3 +x^4 +x^5 +x^6$ . Find the lattice of subfields of $K$ and for each subfield $F$ find a polynomial $g(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$ such that $F$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\mathbb Q$ . My attempt: We know the Galois group to be the cyclic group of order 6. It has two proper subgroups of order 2 and 3 and hence we are looking for only two intermediate field extensions of degree 3 and 2. $\mathbb Q[\zeta_7+\zeta_7^{-1}]$ is a real subfield. $\mathbb Q[\zeta_7-\zeta_7^{-1}]$ is also a subfield.

153413,well-defined functions,"I am asked to argue whether or not the following two functions are well-defined (textbook definition: a) define $y$ for all $x$ in domain, and b) any is mapped to exactly one y).

Similarly, we can take $p=q=0$ for $g$, and the function, again, will not be defined. But the argument seems to be too easy. Is there something I am missing that won't allow me to use these two counter examples? Thanks!","['functions', 'definition']"
