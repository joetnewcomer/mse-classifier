552658,Solving $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x^2e^x}{(1+e^x)^2}dx$,"I am attempting to use residues to solve $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x^2e^x}{(1+e^x)^2}dx$; the answer is $\frac{\pi^2}{3}$. I have tried to split $\frac{x^2e^x}{(1+e^x)^2}$ into two parts $$\frac{x^2}{e^x+1}-\frac{x^2}{\left(e^x+1\right)^2},$$ however no progress was to be made. I could not solve
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{z^2}{e^z+1}-\frac{z^2}{\left(e^z+1\right)^2}dz.
$$
any easier than the problem at hand. As a matter of fact neither of these two integrals converge individually. The way I approached the problem was by finding the singularities, namely when $e^z=-1$. So I got, when we let $z=x+iy$, that $z_k=i\pi+2\pi k$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$. This is my attempt,
$$
\int_{C}\frac{z^2e^{z}}{(e^z+1)^2}=2i\pi\sum_{\forall n}(Res(f,z_n)).
$$
Since $\{-1\}$ is a second order pole, our residue is given by
$$
\lim_{z\to z_k}\frac{d}{dz}[(z-z_k)^2\frac{z^2e^{z}}{(e^z+1)^2}].
$$
I found these with the aid of Mathematica. However if we were to calculate all the residues we would get an alternating sequence, if arranged properly. It becomes more apparent when we solve the equation that is split. For instance if we take $z_{-4}$ we get 
$$
2 \pi  i \left(\lim_{z\to z_{-4}} \, \frac{z^2 (z-z_{-4})}{e^z+1}\right)\ \text{and}\ 2 \pi  i \left(\lim_{z\to z_{-4}} \, \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\frac{\left(z-z_{-4}\right){}^2 \left(-z^2\right)}{\left(e^z+1\right)^2}\right)
$$
or,
$$
98i\pi^3 \text{ and } 14 i (-7 \pi +2 i) \pi ^2.
$$
So the total contribution would be $-28 \pi ^2$. Were as if we take $z_4$ we would get
$$
162 i \pi ^3 \text{ and } -18 i \pi ^2 (9 \pi +2 i)
$$
and the contribution would be $36 \pi ^2$.
One dilemma is finding the summation of all these residues. Is my work flawed? Is there a better contour to make this problem work? Thank you for the assistance.","['calculus', 'integration', 'analysis']"

(remember that $GL_r(\mathbb C)$ is an open affine subvariety of $\mathbb C^{r^2}$) For example Cox in his book on Toric varieties says only that $g_{\alpha\beta}$ is a function.

I want to show that $\operatorname{ran}  \lambda I - T$ is closed. So suppose we have $g_j = (\lambda I - T)f_j \in \operatorname{ran} \lambda I - T$ converging to some $f$. We need to show $f \in \operatorname{ran} \lambda I - T$. First because $\lambda I - T$ is a bounded operator its kernel $V_\lambda$ is closed, hence $\mathcal{H} = V_\lambda^\perp \oplus V_\lambda$. With this we may assume wlog that $f_j \in V_\lambda^\perp$. Now the next hint in the problem is to show that $\{f_j\}$ is bounded under the assumption that $\{f_j\} \subseteq V_\lambda^\perp$. I have tried for about 1 hour and I can't show this. How can I go around showing this? Here's a partial proof for this fact that I have. We may write $$\begin{eqnarray*}||\lambda f_j||& =& \|\lambda f_j - Tf_j + Tf_j\| \\
&\leq& \| (\lambda I - T)f_j\| + \|Tf_j\|\\
&\leq& \|g_j\| +  \|T\|\|f_j\|\\
&\leq& N + \|T\|\|f_j\|\end{eqnarray*}$$
    where we have used that $g_j \to g$ impies $\|g_j\| \leq N$. Now we may rearrange to get $\|f_j\| (|\lambda - \|T\|) \leq N$ and so I will be done if I know $\|\lambda \| - \|T\|) \neq 0$. However this may not be true in general. So how can I show $\{f_j\}$ is bounded using the hint in Stein and Shakarchi? Please do not give full answers. Next, assuming that $\{f_j\}$ is bounded and that $T$ is compact we know $Tf_{n_j} \to f$ for some $f \in \mathcal{H}$. However I don't know how to show this implies $g$ that we started out with is in $\operatorname{ran} \lambda I - T$. What's strange about all of this is they claim in Stein and Shakarchi that the result is not true if $\lambda = 0$. My guess is that we somehow have to use the result that if $\lambda \neq 0$ that $V_\lambda $ is finite dimensional.

Using that the compactly-supported step functions are at least $L^2$-dense in the square-integrable step functions, the claim should follow. Is my reasoning correct? Have I omitted any necessary details? I have no real idea how to approach (2), though logically such a collection ought to include at least the collection of Lebesgue-measurable sets.

Consider this definition: Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. A point $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is an interior point of $S$ if there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ such that $N\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ is denoted by $\operatorname{int} S$ (or in some texts, $S^\circ$) These examples were pulled from practice problems in my textbook, which only gives the final answer without showing why. Given the set $[0,3]\cup(3,5)$, what is the interior? Intuitively I can just look at this and conclude that $[0,3]\cup(3,5)=[0,5)$, and the interior is everything but the boundary points -- namely $(0,5)$. This may be conclusive enough for such a simple example, but what about the sets $S=\{1/n\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ and $T=\{r\in\mathbb{Q}\mid 0<r<\sqrt{2}\}$? I know that $S^0=T^0=\emptyset$, as all the points in $S$ and $T$ are isolated points. But I don't know how to back up that claim. Taking $S$, using the definition I pasted above, I feel like I should try to show that for every $x\in S$, there does not exist a neighborhood of $x$ that is a subset of $S$, but I don't know how to proceed with this.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

553705,Order of an element in a finite cyclic group,"Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $m$ generated by an element $a$.  I want to show that the order of $a^k$ is $m/d$, where $d:=\gcd(k,m)$.  I have a simple proof, but want to make sure I haven't overlooked anything since the other proofs I've seen (such as in Dummit and Foote) look more complicated. The order of $a^k$ is the cardinality of the set $\{a^{ks}: s \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which equals the cardinality of the set $\{a^{ks} a^{mt}: s,t \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ since $a^m$ is the identity.  But the set $\{ks+mt: s,t \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is the set $d \mathbb{Z}$ by the basic properties of integers. So we have that the cardinality of the set is $| \langle a^k \rangle| = |\{1, a^d, a^{2d}, \ldots, a^{m-d} \}| = m/d$.","['ring-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
553730,Computing Coefficients for Generalized Combinatorial Sets,"I'm new to Combinatorics and am wondering if there is a well-known generalization to the binomial coefficients in the following sense: The binomial coefficients, $n \choose d$, can be considered as the number of ways in which $d$ objects can be chosen from among $n$ such that order of selection doesn't matter and no object may be selected more than once, while the multi-set coefficients, ${\big(\!{n\choose d}\!\big)}={n+d-1\choose d}$, enumerate the ways in which $d$ objects can be chosen from among $n$ objects such that order doesn't matter but any object may be chosen any number of times. Is there a middle ground? Specifically, one in which $d$ objects are chosen from among $n$ such that order doesn't matter but the $i^{th}$ object may be selected no more than $k_i$ times? Heuristically, there are two fairly obvious approaches for calculating these numbers (aside from brute force). Let's call these numbers $C(n,d;K)$ for convenience, where $K\equiv \{k_1,k_2,...,k_n\}$. First, one could find the coefficients of polynomials of the form
$$
{\large\prod_{i=0}^{n}{\huge(}\sum_{j=0}^{k_i}(x^j){\huge)}=\sum_{m=0}^{N}C(n,m;K)x^m}
$$
where $k_0\equiv 0$ and $N=\sum_{i=0}^{n}k_i$. On the other hand, one could use an algorithm similar in logic to that of Pascal's Triangle wherein the $C(n,d;K)$ are calculated by summing $k_n$ terms with $n$-value $n'=n-1$ and with $K'=K-\{k_n\}$ and $N'=N-k_n$ (i.e. from the previous ""line"" in a generalized Pascal's Triangle).
$$
\large{C(n,d;K)=\sum_{m=d-k_n}^{d}C(n',m;K')}
$$
with $C(n',m;K')=0$ for all $m<0$ and all $m>N'$. To help clarify, here's an example: Suppose we have 4 object types with the following $k$-values $k_1=1,\ k_2=2,\ k_3=3,\ k_4=4.$ From this we can construct a generalized Pascal's Triangle: $\underline{n=0}:\ 1\\\underline{n=1}:\ 1\ \ 1\\\underline{n=2}:\ 1\ \ 2\ \ 2\ \ 1\\\underline{n=3}:\ 1\ \ 3\ \ 5\ \ 6\ \ 5\ \ 3\ \ 1\\\underline{n=4}:\ 1\ \ 4\ \ 9\ \ 15\ \ 20\ \ 22\ \ 20\ \ 15\ \ 9\ \ 4\ \ 1$ Each term in the $n$th row of the triangle is computed by sliding a window of size $k_n+1$ across the $(n-1)^{th}$ row of the triangle and summing the terms within that window (i.e. for the 3rd row [recall that $k_3=3$], $1=0+0+0+1$, $3=0+0+1+2$, $5=0+1+2+2$, and so on). Like Pascal's Triangle, these generalized triangles have many convenient properties. For instance, the $n^{th}$ row always has $N_n+1$ terms in it; the rows are always symmetrical; and, the final row in the triangle (the one which provides the coefficients we are looking for) doesn't depend on the order in which you compute the previous rows (i.e. the $n=4$ row would look the same in the above example even if the $k$-values were swapped around [e.g. $k_1=2,\ k_2=4$, etc.]). Perhaps the most interesting property is the following:
$$
\large{\sum_{m=0}^{N}C(n,m;K)=\prod_{j=0}^{n}(k_j+1)}
$$
So in the above example this implies that the sum of the $n^{th}$ row is $(n+1)!$, or in the limiting case of the binomial coefficients (in which all $k_i=1$), the sum of the $n^{th}$ row is $2^n$ - as expected. Clearly, there are methods for computing these general set coefficients, but I have been unable to find any literature on a concise formula for the $C(n,d;K)$ given all the parameters of the problem or even anything about efficient methods for computing one of these coefficients without the use of the polynomial generating function cited above. Does anyone know of any such methods or formulae? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"
553734,Stone's theorem for 1-parameter groups of unitary multipliers?,"Let $A$ be a nonunital C*-algebra and let $M(A)$ denote its multiplier algebra. Let $(u_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ be a strictly continuous 1-parameter group of unitary multipliers. That is, $u_t x \to x$ as $t \to 0$ for all $x \in A$. I am wondering whether there exists an unbounded operator $H : A \to A$ such that $u_t  = e^{itH}$ in some sense? I would want some condititions on $H$: $H$ should be densely-defined and closed. That is, the domain of $H$ should be a dense subspace $A_0$ of $A$ and, whenever $x_n \in A_0$ are such that $x_n \to x \in A$ and $H x_n \to y \in A$ we should have $x \in A_0$ and $H x = y$. We should have $H$ symmetric with respect to the $A$-valued inner-product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : A \times A \to A$ given by $\langle x,y \rangle = x^* y$. That is, whenever $x,y \in A_0$, it should hold that $\langle Ax,y \rangle = \langle x,Ay \rangle$. A good ""core"" for $H$ should be something like the set of smooth elements $x \in A$, that is elements for which $t \mapsto u_t x$ is a $C^\infty$ path $\mathbb{R} \to A$. There, we can define $H$ by
$$ H(x) = \frac{1}{i} \frac{d}{dt} \big|_{t = 0} u_t x .$$ Notice that, for $x$ and $y$ smooth in the above sense, we have
$$ \langle u_t x,y \rangle = (u_tx)^* y = x^* u_{-t} y = \langle x, u_{-t} y \rangle. $$
Differentiating both sides and evalutating at $t = 0$ we get gives the desired self-adjointness condition. So one, wants to do things like: Prove that smooth elements are a dense subalgebra Prove that the operator defined as above on smooth elements is closable, probably by using the symmetry condition Find a sense in which $e^{itH} = u_t$, probably strong convergence of the series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(itH)^n}{n!}$ on the $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \operatorname{dom}(H^n)$ or something.

553765,On why the Vitali Covering Lemma does not apply when the covering collection contains degenerate closed intervals,"I believe I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of the Vitali Covering Lemma. Definition - A closed bounded interval $[c, d]$ is said to be nondegenerate provided $c < d$. Definition - A collection $\mathcal{F}$ of closed, bounded, nondegenerate intervals is said to cover a set $E$ in the sense of Vitali provided for each point $x$ in $E$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an interval $I$ in $F$ that contains $x$ and has $l(I) < \epsilon$. The Vitali Covering Lemma - Let $E$ be a set of finite outer measure and $\mathcal{F}$ a collection of closed, bounded intervals that cover $E$ in the sense of Vitali. Then for each $\epsilon > 0$, there is a finite disjoint subcollection $\{I_k\}_{k = 1}^n$ of $\mathcal{F}$ for which $$m^*\left[E \setminus \bigcup_{k = 1}^n I_k\right] < \epsilon.$$ Ok, so it is a true fact that the Vitali Covering Lemma does not apply when the covering collection contains degenerate closed intervals. I don't see why that is the case. Consider a set $E$ that is covered in the sense of Vitali by a collection $\mathcal{F}$. Let's add some degenerate closed intervals into our collection $\mathcal{F}$. Suppose we add $E_1 = [a, a] = \{a\}$ and $E_2 = [a, -a] = \emptyset$ for $a > 0$ to  $\mathcal{F}$. If the degenerate sets somehow cause a problem, why can't the Vitali Covering Lemma just not ""choose"" the degenerate sets in the finite disjoint subcollection $\{I_k\}_{k = 1}^n$ when it asserts the existence of such a subcollection?","['functional-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

What are some interesting proofs of this? Here are two I know of. Proof 1: Assume we have such an $f(z)$. Then restricted to $\Bbb{C}\setminus (-\infty,0]$ we must have $f(z) = \operatorname{Log} z + 2\pi k i$ for some $k \in \Bbb{Z}$. The big log stands for principal log. But now the  $\lim_{z \to a} f(z)$ for any $a \in (-\infty,0]$ does not exist (approaching from the top, the argument approaches $\pi$ but from the bottom it approaches $-\pi$). Proof 2: If we had a holomorphic function $f(z)$ such that $\exp f(z) = z$ then differentiating gives $f'(z) = 1/z$ for all $z \neq 0$. Integrating on $|z|=1$, the left gives $0$ by Cauchy's Theorem but the right is $2\pi i$ which is a contradiction.","['exponential-function', 'big-list', 'complex-analysis']"
