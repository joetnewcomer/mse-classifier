879852,Connections on principal bundles and vector bundles,"In Donaldson and Kronheimer's book on the geometry of four manifolds, a brief review of connections on principal bundles is given. Three equivalent definition are stated: 1) Via horizontal subspaces, 2) Via connections $1$-forms, 3) Via covariant derivatives on an associated vector bundle. The authors then proceed to sketch very briefly the implications $2) \rightarrow 1)$ and $3) \rightarrow 1) $. I am looking for more detailed proofs. I have easily found references for the equivalences between $1)$ and $2)$. However I am having a harder time finding references for anything involving $3)$. Here for instance, the implication $2) \rightarrow 3)$ is proved using local descriptions of connection $1$-forms and covariant derivatives. On the other hand here , the same implication is proved using, basically the fact that connections are the same thing as parallel transport. I can't find any proof of  $3) \rightarrow 1)$ or  $3) \rightarrow 2)$ except the sketch given in Donaldson and Kronheimer's book. Can anyone help? Ps: I realize that the same question was asked here . The question was answered. However I have some difficulties navigating in the concepts of the related link (connections on general fibre bundles).","['principal-bundles', 'connections', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

879860,Can we integrate a measurable function defined on a conull subset of a complete measure space?,"Suppose $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ is a complete measure space, and suppose $f$ is a measurable function with domain of $f$ the set $X \setminus N$ for a measurable set $N$ of measure $0$. Does it make sense to talk about $\int \limits_{X} f \mathrm{d}\mu$?  I've heard varying opinions on this and I really need a definitive answer. Here is my idea to answer this question:  Yes, it makes sense to talk about integrating $f$ over the set $X$ even if it is only defined on a smaller set, because we can find a function $g$ (is it necessarily measurable?) such that $f = g$ if $x \not \in N$, that is, $f = g$ a.e. d$\mu$.  Then, we can define $\int \limits_{X} f \mathrm{d}\mu$ as $\int \limits_{X} g \mathrm{d}\mu$. But then I am conflicted, because this does not agree with the definition of Lebesgue integral, which is $\int \limits_{X} f \mathrm{d}\mu = \sup \{ \int \limits_{X} s \mathrm{d}\mu \mid 0 \leq s \leq f \text{ and $s$ is simple} \}$ (assuming that $f$ is a non-negative funciton).  We can't find simple functions between $0$ and $f$ on the set $N$... Please help me put my mind at ease.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
879861,Can I pull out an arbitrary element from a set?,"Suppose there is an onto function $f: \Bbb R \to \{0, 1\}$. I want to show that there is a function $g: \{0, 1\} \to \Bbb R$, such that $f(g(b)) = b$. I know that there are two element in the domain of $f$ (let's call them $a, b \in dom(f)$) such that $f(a) = 0$, $f(b) = 1$. We just create a function $g = \{(0, a), (1, b)\}$. But what confuses me, is that we just took these elements $a, b$ arbitrary , like pulled them out of a hat. It would be more easier for me to understand if I took a longer way and was using the axioms directly (taking products, making separations) and finally showed that there is a set of functions and every function is what we need.

879893,Second fundamental form of a graph of a function using frame fields,"I am trying to recover the second fundamental form $II$ for the graph $\Gamma(f)$ of a smooth real function $f$ in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ using first order frame fields. I have worked with the first and second fundamental forms in a classical differential geometry course where I studied regular curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$, but am trying to adapt this knowledge to the study of smooth manifolds using the theory of differential forms. Recall that the structure equations for a given frame field $(\mathbf{x},e)$ are $$d\omega^i = -\sum_{j=1}^3 \omega_j^i \wedge \omega^j, \qquad d\omega_j^i = -\sum_{k=1}^3 \omega_k^i \wedge \omega_i^k,$$ where $\omega^i = d\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{e}_i$ and $\omega_i^j = d\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j$. Now, let $M$ be a surface and let $$\mathbf{x} : \begin{pmatrix} x^1 \\ x^2 \\ x^3 \end{pmatrix} : M \to \mathbb{R}^3$$ be a smooth immersion. An Euclidean frame field along $\mathbf{x}$ on an open set $U \subset M$ consists of smooth vector fields $\mathbf{e}_i : U \to \mathbb{R}^3$, $i = 1,2,3$, such that $e = (\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3)$ is an orthonormal frame of $\mathbb{R}^3$ at each point of $U$. Then $d\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed in terms of $e$ by $$d\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \omega^i \mathbf{e}_i,$$ where each $\omega^i$ is a smooth $1$-form defined on $U$ given by $$\omega^i = d\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{e}_i,$$ which is a linear combination of the $dx^i$ with coefficients being the smooth funtions entries of $\mathbf{e}_i$. One can check that choosing $\mathbf{e}_3$ normal at every point is equivalent to the condition that $\omega^3 = 0$ at every point of $U$. This is what we call a first-order frame field along $\mathbf{x}$. By Cartan's Lemma, a first order frame field satisfies $$\omega_i^3 = \sum_{j=1}^2 h_{ij} \omega^j, \qquad \text{for $i=1,2$ and $h_{12}=h_{21}$}.$$ Going back to the theory of surfaces of Gauss, we see that for this frame field, $I$ and $II$ are given by \begin{align}
I &= d\mathbf{x} \cdot d\mathbf{x} = \omega^1\omega^1 + \omega^2\omega^2, \\
II &= -d\mathbf{x} \cdot d\mathbf{e}_3 = \omega^1\omega_1^3 + \omega^2\omega_2^3 \\ 
&= h_{11}\omega^1\omega^1 + 2h_{12}\omega^1\omega^2 + h_{22}\omega^2\omega^2.
\end{align} Knowing this, my question is Given a smooth function $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ such that $M = \Gamma(f)$ defines a smooth surface immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, what is its second fundamental form $II$ in term of differential forms? How do I calculate the $h_{ij}$'s in this case? I am not sure where to start. This seems like a reasonably easy exercise though.

880714,Adding Numbers Pattern,"A few nights ago I couldn't sleep and so started doing this: I would take a number and add up all of its digits to get a new number and then add up all of those digits and so on until there was only one digit left.

I noticed a few patterns and then after explaining the rules of this game to some friends was able to impress them by adding up the digits of huge numbers in a couple seconds! The only pattern really worth mentioning is this: Adding $9$ to a digit doesn't change the final answer (i.e. $12391234$ has the same final answer as $1231234$. Similarily, $158$ has the same final answer as $15899999999999$) So when adding, you can just ignore the $9$. This helped a lot in trying to impress my friends because instead of adding $136271845$ you can just recognize this as $19999$ which will sum up to $1$ since you can ignore $9$.

He does so relying (essentially) only on commutativity in $F$.

So my question this: Why do they all bother with/make a fuss about Steinitz Exchange? Many thanks! Here is a sketch of Beardon's proof: Write $u_1$ in terms of the $v_j$ and write each $v_j$ in terms of the $u_i$.  Then by equating coefficients we obtain something like $1=\sum_{j=1}^n\lambda_{jk}\mu_{kj}$ for each $k=1,\ldots,m$ so by summing over $k$ we obtain $$m=\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^n\lambda_{jk}\mu_{kj}.$$ But by symmetry we also have $$n=\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\lambda_{jk}\mu_{kj}.$$ The result follows.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

More specifically, can a composite number $m$ of the form $2^n-1$ ever pass the test: $a^{m-1} \equiv 1 \mod m$ for all intergers $a >1$ (Fermat's Test)? Cases potentially proved so far: (That are never Carmichael numbers) where $n$ is odd where $n$ is prime Work using ""main"" definition : First off take the definition of a Carmichael number: A positive composite integer $m$ is a Carmichael number if and only if  $m$
  is square-free, and for all prime divisors $p$ of $m$, it is true that $p -
1 \mid m - 1$. Let's assume $m=2^n-1$ is squarefree. (Best case, and I believe it always is for $2^p-1$) Take the case where $n$ (in $2^n-1$) is a prime $p$. All factors of $2^p-1$ must of the form: $2kp+1$ for some constant $k$. So will $2kp$ ever divide $2^p-2$? Factoring a $2$ out gives us $kp \mid 2^{p-1}-1$, or split into two: $k \mid 2^{p-1}-1$ and $p \mid 2^{p-1}-1$ must both be true. By Fermat's little theorem, $2^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$, so $p \mid 2^{p-1}-1$ is always true. So if $k \mid 2^{p-1}-1$ for $k = {q-1 \over p}$, is false for at least one factor $q$ of $2^p-1$, no Carmichael numbers can exist of form $2^p-1$. Now for other cases where $n$ is composite, lets say $n=cp$, for some prime $p$, and some number $c$: $\begin{align}2^{cp}-1&=(2^p-1)\cdot \left(1+2^p+2^{2p}+2^{3p}+\cdots+2^{(c-1)p}\right)\end{align}$ Thus: $2^{n-1} \mid 2^p-1$ Because of that, we must look at the factors of $2^p-1$ when considering if $2^{cp}-1$ is a Carmichael number. So we know those factors are already of form $2kp+1$, and then $kp \mid 2^{cp-1}-1$. This is where I'm left. on an incomplete proof. Using Bernoulli definition: An odd composite squarefree number $m$ is a Carmichael number iff $m$
  divides the denominator of the Bernoulli number $B_{n-1}$. Using the Von Staudt–Clausen theorem, there may be a way to proof that that factors of the Bernoulli number denominators may never divide a mersenne number.","['prime-numbers', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'pseudoprimes', 'number-theory']"

Attempt: Since $01$ can appear in a lot of places, I focused on instances without $01$ first. Bit strings without $01$ in a bit string of length $n$. Let $XX\dots X$ be bit string without $01$: $XX\dots X0$ $1XX\dots X$ Thus we know we acquire twice more bit string without $01$ from length of $n-1$ to $n$. Let $a_n$ be the count of bit strings without $01$ at length $n$, recurrence relation of this is the following: $$a_n = 2a_{n-1}, a_2 = 1$$ The inverse of this is then the recurrence relation with $01$. Let $P_n$ be the recurrence relationship of the number of bit string with length $n$ with $01$, thus, $$P_n = 2^n - a_n = 2^n - 2a_{n-1}, a_2 = 1$$ Since $P_n = 2^n - a_n$, then, $a_n = 2^n - P_n$, thus $$P_n = 2^n - 2*(2^{n-1} - P_{n-1})$$
$$\iff P_n = 2^n - 2^n + 2P_{n-1}$$
$$P_n = 2P_{n-1}, P_2 = 1$$ Problem: I've also played around with the n-combination to solve this. The format of a bit string without $01$ is the following, $$1\dots10\dots0$$ Adding $0$ or $1$ to either side adds a $01$, thus we can only add either $1$ on the left and $0$ on the right. Another way to view this is, $1^p0^q, p, q \geq 1$ The number of bit strings without $01$ is for a bit string of length $n$, $${2 + n - 2 - 1\choose n-2} = \\
{n-1 \choose 1} = \\
n-1$$ The inverse of this is, $$2^n - n+1$$ Which is the number of bit string with $01$ at length $n$. If we solve the recurrence relation above for $P_n$, $$P_3 = 2P_2 = 2$$
$$P_4 = 2*2\\

If this isn't the case, then I think they're at least closely related. Anyway, the geometric median (Steiner point) for two, three, or four points has a known finite, exact formula or algorithm, but the impossibility of such a formula or algorithm for five points has been proved. This seems to me to be remarkably similar to how finite, exact, and general solutions for polynomials of degree 2, 3, or 4 are known, but for degrees 5 and above, no such formulas exist. What made me wonder was that the geometric median for five points cannot be constructed, and there is no quintic formula that has a finite number of square roots, and constructibility and a finite number of square roots seem to be closely related.

881176,Borel measure which is not regular,"I need an example where a Borel measure is not regular . I already proved that any finite Borel measure is regular and tight. The examples of irregular measures given here are too rigid and not so elegant, moreover I am not familiar with the concept of measurable cardinals. So I want better examples.

881202,How many $10$ digit number exists that sum of their digits is equal to $15$?,"How many $10$ digit number exists that sum of their digits is equal to $15$? Additional info: First digit from left is not $0$.we could use any digits from $0$ to $9$. I saw in some related questions that they used Inclusion-exclusion .I've yet to study it so I would like someone continue one of this approaches in a way that does not need Inclusion-exclusion.However,if it's not possible without Inclusion-exclusion,write your answers anyway. Thing I have done so far :The main challenge in this problem is counting bad situations. Because we know number of ways that sum of $10$ number is equal to $15$. I have two approachs: Approach #1:$$x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{10}=15\space, \space x_1\geq 1\space ,\space 0\leq x_i\leq9$$ Using stars and bars number of answers of this equation:$$x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{10}=15\space, \space 0\leq x_i\leq15$$ Is equal to :$${15+10-1 \choose 10-1}={24 \choose 9}$$ Now counting situations that one of $x_i$ is bigger than $10$:$$x'_1=x_1-10 \space, \space x'_2=x_2\space,\cdots,x'_{10}=x_{10}\space, \space x'_{1}+\cdots+x'_{10}=5\space,\space0\leq x'_i\leq5$$ I assume here that $x_1$ is bigger than $10$ but any of $x_i$ could be.So number of situations that one of them is bigger than $10$ is : ${5+10-1 \choose 10-1}\times10={14 \choose 9}\times 10$ Now I don't now what about situations where $x_1= 0$ Approach #2(I like this more): I was thinking that getting rid of those situations that $x_1 = 0\space$ is much easier.So $$x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{10}=15\space, \space x_1\geq 1\space ,\space x_2,x_3,\cdots,x_{10}\geq 0$$
So number of answers of this equation is ${15+10-1-1 \choose 10-1}={23 \choose 9}$ Now I should count number of ways one of digits is bigger than 10.I don't know what to do here. Some updates on approach #2: if biggest $x_i$ is $15$ , then there is $1$ possible situation with $x_1 \geq 1$. if biggest $x_i$ is $14$ , then there is $9+9=18$ possible situation with $x_1 \geq 1$. So my question right now is something like this: a clever way to count situations where $x_1\geq 1$ and largest $x_i$ is equal to $10$. Here is a c++ code that counts all these numbers. #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool a(int n)
{
 int i;
 int sum=0;
 while(n != 0)
 {
        i= n % 10;
        sum= sum + i;
        n= n /10;
 }
 if (sum == 15) return true;
 return false;    
 }
int main()
{
int k=0;
for(int j=1000000000;j<9600000000;j++)
{
    if(a(j)) 
    {
     k++;
    }           
}
cout<<k+1<<endl;     
} Which prints $808753$. And ${23 \choose 9}-(18+1)=817171$. So $817171 -808753 = 8418$ if biggest $x_i$ is $13$ , then there is $18+{9 \choose 2}\times 3=126$ possible situation with $x_1 \geq 1$. So $8418 -126 =8292$. if biggest $x_i$ is $12$ , then there is $18+6{9 \choose 2}+4{9 \choose 3}=570$ possible situation with $x_1 \geq 1$. So $8292 - 570=7722$","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"

881272,Free product as automorphism group of graph,"Let $A$ and $B$ be two groups. We define following graph $X$. The set of vertices is the left cosets $gA$ and $gB$ where $g\in A*B$ (By $A*B$, I mean the free product of $A$ and $B$). The edges of the graph X correspond to the elements of $A*B$, and we use $e_g$ to denote the edge associated to $g\in A*B$. This does have the unfortunate consequence that the edge associated to the identity is $e_e$. Each edge is associated to an unordered pair of vertices: $\operatorname{Ends}(e_g) = \{gA,gB\}$. I want to show that $\operatorname{Aut}(X)=A*B$. I can show that $A*B$ is a subset of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)=A*B$, but I do not any idea for the converse.","['graph-theory', 'geometric-group-theory', 'group-theory']"

I am learning trigonometric identities one identity I have to proof is the next: $ (1- \sin \alpha + \cos \alpha)^2 = 2 (1 - \sin \alpha)(1+ \cos \alpha)$ so I tried to resolve the identity for the left: $  1 + \sin^2 \alpha+ \cos^2\alpha - 2\sin\alpha + 2\cos\alpha - 2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha  $ $=  1 + 1 - 2\sin\alpha + 2\cos\alpha - 2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha  $ $=  2 (1 - \sin\alpha + \cos\alpha - \sin\alpha\cos\alpha)$ And I got stuck, I did not know what to do, so I went to see the problem's answer and I was going fine, the part I was not able to resolve is the next one: $  2 (1 - \sin\alpha + \cos\alpha - \sin\alpha\cos\alpha)$ $=  2 (1  + \cos\alpha - \sin\alpha(1+\cos\alpha))$ $=  2 (1 - \sin \alpha)(1+ \cos \alpha)$ So the question is how did the teacher do the last three steps?
