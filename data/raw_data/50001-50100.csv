510749,Cool mathematics I can show to calculus students.,"I am a TA for theoretical linear algebra and calculus course this semester. This is an advanced course for strong freshmen. Every discussion section I am trying to show my students (give them as a series of exercises that we do on the blackboard) some serious math that they can understand and appreciate. For example, when we were talking about cross products, I showed them the isomorphism between $\mathbb{R}^3$ with cross product and Lie algebra $so(3)$. Of course I didn't use fancy language, but we have proved Jacobi identity for cross product, then we picked a basis in skew-symmetric matrices $3\times 3$ and checked that when you commute these three basis vectors, you get exactly the ""right hand rule"" for cross product. So these two things are the same. For the next recitation the topics are 1) eigenvalues and eigenvectors; 2) real quadratic forms. Can you, please, recommend some cool things that we can discuss with them so that they will learn about eigenvalues and forms, but without doing just boring calculations? By ""cool things"" I mean some problems coming from serious mathematics, but when explained properly they might be a nice exercise for the students. Moreover, do you know if there is a book with serious math given in accessible for freshmen form (in the form of exercises would be absolutely great!)? Thank you very much!","['education', 'advice', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"
510777,If $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is an uniformly continuous semigroup of bounded linear operators then $T(s)\to T(t)$.,"Definition: Let $X$ be a Banach space and $I$ the identity operator on $X$. A family $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ of bounded linear operators from $X$ into $X$ is a semigroup of bounded linear operator on $X$ if (i) $T(0)=I$; (ii) $T(t + s)= T(t)T(s)$ for every $t,s\geq 0$. A semigroup $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq0}$ of bounded linear operators is uniformly continuous if $$\lim_{t\downarrow 0}\|T(t)-I\|=0.\;\;\;\;(*)$$ The Pazy's book says ""from the definition it's clear that if $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is an uniformly continuous semigroup of bounded linear operators then $\lim_{s\to t}\|T(s)-T(t)\|=0$"" (page 1). For me, this equality it's not so clear. Could someone help me to prove it? I'm trying to show that $$\lim_{s\to t^+}\|T(s)-T(t)\|=\lim_{s\to t^-}\|T(s)-T(t)\|=0.$$ If I'm not wrong, from the definition we can conclude that, for all $h>0$, $$0\leq \|T(t+h)-T(t)\| \overset{(ii)} =\|T(t)T(h)-T(t)\| \leq \|T(t)\|\|T(h)-I\|$$ Now, notice that $$\lim_{h\to 0^+}\|T(t)\|\|T(h)-I\|=\|T(t)\|\lim_{h\downarrow 0}\|T(h)-I\|
\overset{(*)}=\|T(t)\|\;0=0$$ Thus (by Squeeze theorem), $$\lim_{s\to t^+}\|T(s)-T(t)\| =\lim_{h\to 0^+}\|T(t+h)-T(t)\| = 0$$ My question is: how to prove that $\lim_{s\to t^-}\|T(s)-T(t)\|=0$? Thanks.","['semigroup-of-operators', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

510923,What is the significance of limit points?,"When I had my first taste of topology a couple of years ago, our lecturer emphasized the following notions. closed set, closure, closure point open set, interior, interior point Of course, these are all basically different ways of talking about the same thing. For example, from the family of closed sets of a space we can obtain its closure operator, and the fixed points of the closure operator are precisely the closed sets; the open sets are precisely the complements of the closed sets, etc. Anyway, the concepts were well-motivated from the viewpoint of continuous functions between metric spaces. For example, it was demonstrated that if $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces and $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a function, then the following are equivalent $f$ is continuous in the sense of $\epsilon$-$\delta$. The preimage of a closed set under $f$ is closed. The preimage of an open set under $f$ is open. $f(\mathrm{cl} \,A)\subseteq\mathrm{cl}(f(A))$ for all $A \subseteq X$. $\mathrm{cl}(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq f^{-1}(\mathrm{cl} \,B)$ for all $B \subseteq X$. $f^{-1}( \mathrm{int} (B)) \subseteq \mathrm{int} ( f^{-1} ( B ) )$ for all $B \subseteq Y$. etc. Anyway, on Wikipedia there's some related concept that weren't really dealt with in the course I took, namely limit points and isolated points . I understand the definitions (Wikipedia is clear enough), yet at the same time I don't understand their significance. They just seem like closure points, but less well-behaved. For example, the set of all closure points of a set always includes the original set. The same is true of the set of all limit points, so long as the original set did not possess any isolated points, indeed we get the same answer. The only time we get a different answer is when the original set has at least one isolated point; but, in this case, the act of taking the set of all limit points is no longer so well-behaved; indeed, it will never include the original set. So, its not clear to me the benefit of thinking in terms of limit points, as opposed to closure points. In what circumstances are limit points the right concept, and, more broadly, what is their significance?","['general-topology', 'motivation', 'soft-question']"
510947,Assuming every continuous function is uniformly continuous,"If every continuous function, let's say $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$, that they are uniformly continuous, can I assume that $X$ is compact? I'm just wondering if I am true, can someone verify that I'm correct? Since compact of a set is defined by it being closed and bounded, and since the domain $X$ has to be bounded and closed for the function $f$ to be uniformly continuous, I think it's obvious that the domain $X$ is compact. The image $Y$ doesn't necessary have to be bounded, but the domain has to, right?  Please point out if I'm wrong, or just say I'm right, yea!",['general-topology']

511009,Find the characteristic polynomial of the inverse of a matrix,"Given the characteristic polynomial $\chi_A$ of an invertible matrix $A$, I'm to find $\chi_{A^{-1}}$. I can see that this is theoretically possible. $\chi_A$ uniquely determines the similarity class of $A$, which uniquely determines the similarity class of $A^{-1}$, which uniquely determines $\chi_{A^{-1}}$. Calculating the coefficients of $\chi_{A^{-1}}$ explicitly and then relating them to the coefficients of $\chi_A$ seems unfeasible. I thought about calculating the factors instead, which could be easier since I at least have some idea what the linear factors $\chi_{A^{-1}}$ are (since I can see how to get the eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ from those of $A$), but that doesn't help me with potential higher-degree irreducibles or repeated linear factors.

Consider the case in two dimensions: Assume $f(x,y) = xg(x,y) + yh(x,y)$ where $f,g,h$ are smooth. Then 
$$ {\partial f \over \partial x } (x,y) = g(x,y) + x {\partial g \over \partial x } (x,y) + y {\partial h \over \partial x } (x,y)$$ and then $${\partial f \over \partial x } (0,0) = g(0,0)$$ The same argument works for $n$ dimensions.

As a budding number theorist, my ears perked up and I looked through some of the material haphazardly. I don't really know much about sieves, but I became intrigued when I read over the notes on Brun's Sieve . I remember hearing Chen's result that there are infinitely primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is either a near-prime (i.e. the product of two primes) or prime, but I've never pursued its proof. In these notes on Brun's Sieve, an exercise is assigned that is similar in spirit, though (almost certainly) much easier and direct (I paraphrase a little): The Task Use Brun's Sieve to show that there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p+2$ is the product of at most $20$ primes. I couldn't manage to solve this exercise (in fact, I got a bit lost). So I opened up my Iwaniec-Kowalski, which I believe may be where this problem was sourced for MIT's OCW. It is assigned as exercise 2 in Chapter 6, with a bit more background (I wouldn't exactly say that Iwaniec-Kowalski ever provides much exposition, but it's certainly been a good reference for me in the past). But I still wasn't able to provide a proof. I'm aware that it hinges around the idea of considering a sequence/arithmetic function $$ a_n = \begin{cases} 1 & n + 2 \text{ is prime} \\ 0 & \text{else}\end{cases}$$ and then, apparently, sieving using Brun's Sieve on the interval $[1,x]$ excluding primes on $[1, x^{1/20}]$ . When I try to perform the sieving, I get caught up in circular arguments concerning what MIT's notes and I-K both call $V(z)$ , so I must be parsing things incorrectly. But I also highly suspect that this is a very straightforward exercise. My immediate goal is twofold: Learn how to use Brun's Sieve to do the above task, and See how far we can push Brun's Sieve to get similar results for $p+2$ as the product of fewer than $20$ primes. If you happen to be very familiar with these sieves, I would also be interested in knowing why one might use Brun's Sieve as opposed to, say, Selberg's Sieve (which was recently put to good use by Yitang Zhang).

Here is my proof: Can someone say of this this right or where you see mistakes in the argumentation? $\impliedby$: We first want to show that all $f\in C(K)$ with $\left|f(k)\right|=1$ for all $k\in K$ are extreme points. Thus suppose we have functions $f,g:K\rightarrow\left[-1,1\right]$ and $\alpha\in\left(0,1\right)$ such that $1=\alpha f(k)+(1-\alpha)g(k)$ for all $k\in K$ then we must have $1=\left|f\right|=\left|g\right|$. $\implies$: Let $f$ be an extreme point of the unit ball $B$. Then we must have $\left\|f\right\|_{\infty}=1$, thus there exists $x_0\in K$ such that $\left|f(x_0)\right|=1$. Suppose $\left|f(x_0)\right|=1$, then we want to prove that $\left|f(k)\right|=1$ for all $k\in K$. To sake a contradiction suppose we can find $k_0\in int(K)$ such that $0<\left|f(k_0)\right|<1$ and define $\epsilon>0$ to be $\epsilon=1-\left|f(k_0)\right|>0$. Now notice that $f$ in continuous thus we may find a $\delta>0$ such that $B(x_0,\delta)\subseteq int(K)$ and $1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}<f(x)<1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ since $x\in B(x_0,\delta)$. Now we can apply the Urysohn's Lemma to conclude that there exists a function $h:K\rightarrow\left[-1,1\right]$ such that $h(k_0)=1$ and $h(x)=0$ if $x\notin B(x_0,\delta)$. Now we can get two new functions $f_1=f+\frac{\epsilon}{2}h$ and $f_2=f-\frac{\epsilon}{2}h$ in the unit ball. Notice that $f=\frac{1}{2}(f_1+f_2)$ therefore $f$ can not be an extreme point.

512112,A finite field extension $K\supset\mathbb Q$ contains finitely many roots of unity,"I must show that any finite field extension $K\supset \mathbb Q$ can only contain finitely many roots of unity. I reasoned in the following manner:
Let $n<\infty$ be the degree of $K$ over $\mathbb Q$. Now, for any $\alpha\in K$ we must clearly have $\mathbb Q(\alpha)\subseteq K$. So the degree of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb Q$ is at most $n$. Hence, if we can show that there are only finitely many roots of unity of degree less than or equal to $n$, we are done. Now, since any root of unity of degree less than or equal to $n$ is a primitive $k$'th root of unity for some $k\leq n$ it follows that $K$ can at most contain all roots of the finite list of cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,...,\Phi_n$ which each has finitely many roots. All together this will be finitely many, which proves the claim. So my questions are: Is this correct/enough? When this exercise was on the blackboard in class a rather lengthy argument came up. So am I missing some important point here? My final version Having understood the point I missed before, I now see that it will suffice to argue that $\operatorname{deg}(\Phi_k)=\varphi(k)$ eventually exceeds $n$. We know that
$$
\varphi(k)=\prod_ j\varphi(p_j^{a_j})
$$
where $p_j$ are the prime factors of $k$ (similarly to what Ewan Delanoy gave in his answer). Now first note that $\varphi(p^k)$ is stricly increasing both with the prime $p$ and the multiplicity $k$. So we may find a multiplicity $M$ such that $\varphi(2^M)>n$ thus implying $\varphi(p^M)>n$ for all primes. Also any prime $p>n+1$ must have $\varphi(p^k)\geq p-1>n$ for all $k$. This shows that $\varphi(k)>n$ if one of the prime factors of $k$ is larger than $n+1$ or one of the multiplicities is at least $M$. This will certainly happen for $k$ large enough.","['roots-of-unity', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

The prescheme $X$ over $k$ is defined to be $X_0 \times_{\mathrm{Spec}k_0} \mathrm{Spec}k$. So if $X_0 = \mathrm{Spec}R$ is affine, then $X =\mathrm{Spec}R \otimes_{k_0}k$. The following example is: Here are questions I have and points I am in need of help in order to understand Is the set of prime ideals of $\mathbb C[X,Y]$ $$\{(0)\} \cup \{(X-a,Y-b)|a,b \in \mathbb C\} \cup \{(f(X,Y))| f(X,Y) \text{ is irreducible over } \mathbb C[X,Y]\}?$$ Let $R$ be $\mathbb R[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$. So $X = \mathrm{Spec}R_0$ where $R_0 = \mathbb C[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$? The prime ideals of $R_0$ are the image of prime ideals of $\mathbb C[X,Y]$ under the canonical map $\mathbb C[X,Y] \rightarrow \mathbb C[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1)$? How can I get the correspondence between the set of prime ideals and points on the surface in the first figure? Moreover, how is the correspondence between the rational points, other points and the prime ideals obtained? I don't understand the last sentence in bracket. Thanks for everyone.",['algebraic-geometry']
