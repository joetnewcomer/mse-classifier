124337,How should I understand a PDE that contains distribution or measure mathematically?,"We know that the Dirac delta can be loosely thought of as a function on the real line which is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is infinite,
$$
\delta(x)=\begin{cases}+\infty, &x=0\\
0, &x\neq 0
\end{cases}
$$
and which is also constrained to satisfy the identity
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(x)dx=1
$$
However, this is merely a heuristic characterization. The Dirac delta function is rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure . Here comes the problem. I've seen many PDEs that contain delta functions, which are not functions at all, in the traditional sense.  For example the following: Stokes equations with singularly forced:
    $$                       
  \begin{align}
    -\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2{\bf u}+{\bf g}\delta({\bf x}-{\bf x}_0) &= 0,\\
    \nabla\cdot {\bf u} &= 0
  \end{align}
$$
    where ${\bf g}=(g_i)_{1\leq i\leq 3}\in{\mathbb R}^3$ is an arbitrary constant vector, ${\bf x}_0$ is an arbitrary point in the domain, and $\delta$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. Here are my questions : For the first equation, the first two terms, $-\nabla p$, $\mu\nabla^2{\bf u}$, are functions in the traditional sense, how should I understand ""a traditional sense function plus a distribution/measure""? Generally, what does a PDE mean when it contains a measure or distribution?","['measure-theory', 'distribution-theory', 'partial-differential-equations']"

My next question: If I'm not mistaken, $S_6$ should be a subgroup of some larger group of permutations, but smaller than the group of all permutations on that larger set---I would think a group of permutations on a set that has $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ as a subset---such that some inner automorphism of that larger group, when restricted to $S_6$, is an outer automorphism of $S_6$.

124422,Local Ring of a Subvariety (problem 1.3.13 in Hartshorne),"I've began to study AG to prepare for grad school and I'm stuck with the following problem in Hartshorne. The problem statement is as follows (found on p. 22 in Hartshorne's AG): Let $Y\subseteq X$ be a subvariety. Let $\mathcal{O}_{Y,X}$ be the set of equivalence classes $\langle U,f\rangle$, where $U\subseteq X$ is open, $U\cap Y\neq \emptyset$, and $f$ is a regular function on $U$. We say that $\langle U,f\rangle$ is equivalent to $\langle V,g\rangle$, if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$. Show that $\mathcal{O}_{Y,X}$ is a local ring, with residue field $K(Y)$ and dimension = $\dim X-\dim Y$. I consulted a few solution sets for Hartshorne that can be found online, but they both handwaved the part that I'm stuck with. The solutions sets are the following: http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~jcutrone/Work/Hartshorne%20Algebraic%20Geometry%20Solutions.pdf http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/256A/1.3.pdf My approach to solve the problem is as follows. Look at the following ideal: $$\mathfrak{m}=\{\langle U,f\rangle \mid f(P)= 0 \; \forall P\in U\cap Y\}$$ It's easy to show that any element not contained in it is invertible. We then have a canonical map $\mathcal{O}_{Y,X}\to K(Y)$ given by $$\langle U,f\rangle \mapsto \langle U\cap Y,f\rangle$$ and the kernel of this map is obviously $\mathfrak{m}$. However, I'm totally stuck with proving that this map is surjective, which is required in order to prove that the residue field is $K(Y)$. This part seems to be handwaved by both of the solutions provided above. In other words, I would need to show that if $f$ is regular on an open set $U\subset Y$, then $f$ extends to a regular function on some open $V\subset X$ s.t. $U\supset V\cap Y$.",['algebraic-geometry']
124425,Finding a basis for the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4})$,"This is exercise A4 in chapter 29 from Pinter's A Book of Abstract Algebra .  It is not homework but hints/roadmap would be preferred to a full solution for now. First some context The book works out the example of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1+\sqrt[3]{2}})$.  If $a = \sqrt{1+\sqrt[3]{2}}$ then $a^2-1 = \sqrt[3]{2}$, so that $\sqrt[3]{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(a)$, from which it follows that $\mathbb{Q}(a) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},a)$.  We then adjoin $\sqrt[3]{2}$ and $a$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ in order. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ is an extension of degree $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with basis $\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3}\}$.  Since $x^2-1-\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$, the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},a)$ is an extension of degree $2$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ with basis $\{1,a\}$.  Thus $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},a)$ is an extension of degree $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with basis $\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3},a,a 2^{1/3},a 2^{2/3}\}$. The question at hand I have to find a basis for the field extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4})$. A hint is given: This is similar to the case for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1+\sqrt[3]{2}})$.  Adjoin first $\sqrt[3]{4}$, then $a$. I'm not sure if the $a$ in the hint refers to the same $a$ as in the example or if it refers to $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4}$. Naively I computed $$
\left(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4}\right)^2 = 2 + 2 \sqrt{2} \sqrt[3]{4} + \left(\sqrt[3]{4}\right)^2
$$ and $$
\left(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4}\right)^3 = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} + 6 \sqrt[3]{4} + 3\sqrt{2}\left(\sqrt[3]{4}\right)^2,
$$ but I'm not seeing how to combine these to show that $\sqrt[3]{4} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{4})$, which would allow me to follow the steps of the example.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

124458,"There's a real between any two rationals, a rational between any two reals, but more reals than rationals?","The following statements are all true: Between any two rational numbers, there is a real number (for example, their average). Between any two real numbers, there is a rational number (see this proof of that fact , for example). There are strictly more real numbers than rational numbers. While I accept each of these as true, the third statement seems troubling in light of the first two.  It seems like there should be some way to find a bijection between reals and rationals given the first two properties. I understand that in-between each pair of rationals there are infinitely many reals (in fact, I think there's $2^{\aleph_0}$ of them), but given that this is true it seems like there should also be in turn a large number of rationals between all of those reals. Is there a good conceptual or mathematical justification for why the third statement is tue given that the first two are as well? Thanks!

124484,Show $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{6}]$ is a Euclidean domain,"I'm attempting to modify the proof the $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is a Euclidean domain to prove a similar result for $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{6}]$. The idea is to prove that $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{6}]$ is Euclidean which will then give the result for  $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{6}]$. According to Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra this should have norm $d(a+b\sqrt{6})=|a^2-6b^2|$. The result for $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ relies on the fact that for any element $x$ in $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$ there is an element $x'$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ with $d(x-x')<1$, which is then used to show that for $x=qy+r$ we have
$$
d(r)=d(x-qy)=d\left(y\left(\frac{x}{y}-q\right)\right)=d(y)d\left(\frac{x}{y}-q\right)<d(y)

124544,Conditions for the Finitely Generated Intersection Property,"While going through Gratzer's ""General Lattice Theory"", I was surprised to learn (via some exercise) that the intersection of two finitely generated subgroups is not necessarily finitely generated.

Some quick Google-ing yields some papers which have results for specific cases, but little in regard to the property in the general case. My question is this: What can be said in the general case about the FGIP? Is there some known necessary and sufficient criteria which a group must possess for the FGIP property to hold? Or is this property too vague for consideration in the general case? Thanks in advance! EDIT:
I think that the following questions are also natural and related to  my original post. They may be equivalent variations of the same question, but I am not sure for my own part. I apologize if they are redundant. (1) Given a group G and two specific finitely-generated subgroups, H and K, are there necessary and sufficient conditions as to whether the intersection of H and K is finitely-generated? (2) Given an arbitrary group G, is it a decidable problem to determine whether it possesses FGIP?

0, & \text{if } i \ne j \end{cases}$ The dual space is a vector space $V^*$ that can be defined to any $\mathbb{K}-$vector space $V$. Its elements are linear transformations $\Phi: V \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$. According to my script and Wikipedia a base to the dual space can be found quite easily. If $X = \{x_i\}_{i = 1, 2, ..., n}$ is a base of V, then $X^* = \{x_i^*\}_{i = 1, 2, ...,n}$ with $x_i^*(x_j) = \delta_{ij}$. Now I chose the $\mathbb{R}^1$-vector space with $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ to get a really simple example. Then $X = \{1\}$ and $X^* = \{x_1^*\}$ with $x_1^* (x) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } x = 1 \\
0, & \text{if } x \neq 1

124732,"Deligne, elliptic curves and modular forms","I'm trying to understand an argument of Deligne (in Courbes elliptiques: Formulaire d'après J. Tate), but I'm not familiar enough with algebraic geometry, so I'm getting quite confused. So even in my statement I might say things that don't make any sense, please correct me if so. An elliptic curve is a smooth proper morphism $p : E \rightarrow S$ of schemes, such that the geometric fibers are connected curves of genus 1, along with a section $e: S \rightarrow E$.
The sheaf of differentials $\Omega_{E/S}$ can be pushed forward to get a sheaf $\omega_{E/S} = p_{*}\Omega_{E/S}$ on $S$. Next, he shows how $E$ can be embedded in projective space $\mathbb{P}_S^2$, in non-homogeneous coordinates:
$ (*)\space\space\space\space y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6$. Then later on, he defines modular forms of weight $n$ as being a law that associates to each elliptic curve $E \rightarrow S$ as above, a section of $\omega_{E/S}^{\otimes n}$ in a manner which is compatible with base change. 
He next says: applying the definition to the equation above (*), we see that any modular form of weight $n$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the $a_i$'s. 
I sort of see how that might make sense, but I'd appreciate it if someone could explain a bit more to me how to explicitly derive that conclusion (that they're polynomials in the $a_i$'s). Thanks in advance!

Possible Duplicate: Convergence of integrals in $L^p$ Let $\{f_n\}$ be sequence of functions in $L^p$, $1\lt p \lt \infty$, which converge a.e. to a function $f\in L^p$. Suppose that there is a $M$ such that $\|f_n\| \leq M$ for all $n$. Then I would like to show that for each function $g\in L^q$ we have $$ \int fg = \lim \int f_ng.$$ Would the result hold true if $p =1$? My Attempt: I want to show $\left|\int (f_ng-fg)\right|\lt \varepsilon.$  I observe that $$\left|\int (f_ng-fg)\right| \lt \int \left| f_n-f\right||g| \leq \|f_n-f\|_p \|g\|_q,$$ and $$\|f_n-f\|_{L^p(E)}\leq M + \|f\|_{L^p(E)}.$$ Since $g\in L^q$,for every $\varepsilon \gt 0,\exists \delta \gt 0$ such if $\mu(E)\lt \delta$, $$ \|g\| = \left(\int _E |g|^q\right)^{1/q} \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2\left(M + \|f\|_{L^p(E)}\right)}.$$ I can also call on Egoroff, to find a set $E$ of measure less that $\varepsilon$ such $f_n$ converges uniformly on $E^c$. Thus for some $n\gt N$, $$|f_n-f| \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2(\mu(E^c))^{1/p}\|g\|_{L^q(E)}},$$ so that $$\|f_n-f\|_{L^p(E^c)} \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2\|g\|_{L^q(E^c)}}.$$ Thus, $$

124788,"Infinite tetration, convergence radius","I got this problem from my teacher as a optional challenge. I am open about this being a given problem, however it is not homework. The problem is stated as follows. Assume we have an infinite tetration as follows $$x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ With a given $a$ find $x$ . The next part of the problem was to discuss the convergence radius of a. If a is too big or too small the tetration does not converge. Below is my humble stab at the problem. My friend said you would have to treat the tetration as a infinite series, and therefore could not perform algebraic manipulations on it before it is know whether it converges or diverges. However my attempt is to first do some algebraic steps, then discuss the convergence radius. I) Initial discussion At the start it is obvious that the tetration converges when $a=1$ (just set $x=1$ )
Now after some computer hardwork it seems that the tetration fails to converge when a is roughly larger than 3. II) Algebraic manipulation $$ x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ This is the same as $$ x^a \, = \, a$$ $$ \log_a(x^a) \, = \, \log_a(a)$$ $$ \log_a(x) \, = \, \frac{1}{a}$$ $$ x \, = \, a^{\frac{1}{a}}$$ Now, if we let $a=2$ then $x = \sqrt{2}$ . After some more computational work, this seems to be correct, which makes me believe this formula is correct. III) Discsussion about convergence By looking at the derivative of $ \displaystyle \large a^{\frac{1}{a}} $ we see that the maxima occurs when $a=e$ , which also seems to correspond to the inital computational work.
Now I think, that the minima of $\displaystyle \large a^{1/a}$ is zero by looking at its graph, studying its derivative and the endpoints. So that my ""guess"" or work shows that it converges when $$ a \in [0 \, , \,  1/e] $$ VI) My questions Can my algebraic manipulations be justified? They seem rather sketchy
taking the a`th logarithm and so on . (Although they seem to ""magically""
give out the right answer) By looking at Wikipedia it seems that the tetration converge when $$ a \in \left[ 1/e \, , \, e \right] $$ This is almost what I have, why is my lower bound wrong?

$$ (The last equality is pretty intuitive and easy to show). Is $G$ Positive semidefinite? $D$, $n$ and $k$ are all given positive integers. It is clear that $G$ is symmetric with only positive entries. For inspiration it is pretty easy to show that the matrix $M$ defined by $M_{i,j} = |S(A_i) \cap S(A_j)|$ is Positive semidefinite. Create a vector $v_i$ that has $v_{i,j} = 1$ if $j\in S(A_i)$ and $0$ otherwise. each $v_i$ is then a $D+1$ dimensional vector and we have $M_{i,j} = \langle v_i, v_j\rangle$, so $M$ is the product of a matrix and its transpose.",['linear-algebra']

Some Remarks: It seems to be a quite stringent condition. The character $\chi$ must be valued in $\mathbf{Z}$. Indeed, $\chi$ must extend to the  character of $S_n$ given by the trivial plus the standard representation. A Caution : Suppose that $G = D_8$ is the dihedral group of order $8$, and $H = Q_8$ is the quaternion  group of order $8$. Then the character tables of $G$ and $H$ are the same. In particular, the inclusion $G \rightarrow S_4$ gives rise to a character $\chi$ of $G$ which does come from a permutation representation, but the ""corresponding"" character of $H$ does not. So the answer  must involve knowing more than  the character table of $G$.

I'm not really an algebraic geometer by trade, though I have covered some basics before, and I am essentially looking for some intuition behind what a rational map actually is, beyond the algebraic geometry definition. In my opinion, the (formal) definition is as ugly as sin, and any ""informal"" definition which I sometimes find accompanying the formal one is almost equally dire. I feel like, given its definition as a ""partial function between algebraic varieties"", and also its name, it is in some manner an extension of the idea of a quotient of 2 polynomial functions $f(X)/g(X)$ (which would of course be defined everywhere where $g$ is nonzero). However, none of the materials I can find online are proving very fruitful in developing an understanding of what these maps are really meant to ""be"", beyond the raw definition. I would just like to hear, in simple terms if possible, what you understand a rational map to be, if there is actually more to be said than just the definition: for example, is there some result which says ""on nice (affine, irreducible, etc?) spaces, a rational map is of the form $f/g$, polynomials $f$, $g$"" as above, or something along those lines? Or, are there just certain spaces (I normally only need to worry about affine things like $\mathbb{C}^n$, for example!), where a rational map always has some nice form?

The hint suggests looking at the matrix $N$ obtained by exchanging two columns of $M$. It then asks ""What is the relationship between $N^\mathrm{T}N$ and $M^\mathrm{T}M$?""

125094,When does Stinespring dilation yield a faithful representation?,"Let $A$ be a $C^*$-algebra, $H$ a Hilbert space, $\phi: A \to B(H)$ a completely positive map.  The Stinespring construction yields a triple $(K, V, \pi)$ where $K$ is a Hilbert space, $V: H \to K$ a bounded linear map with $\|V\|^2 = \|\phi(1)\|$, and $\pi: A \to B(K)$ a *-representation satisfying $V^* \pi(\cdot) V = \phi(\cdot)$.  The triple $(K, V, \pi)$ becomes unique up to unitary equivalence once we impose the minimality condition $\overline{\pi(A) VH} = K$. I'm interested in what conditions on $\phi$ are equivalent to (or at least imply) the faithfulness of the representation $\pi$.  Here are a few observations: Clearly, faithfulness of $\phi$ implies faithfulness of $\pi$, since any operator with a nonzero compression is perforce nonzero. The converse fails; for instance, if $\phi$ is a vector state on $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ (so $H$ is one-dimensional), then $\phi$ is not faithful, but Stinespring (=GNS) yields the identity representation. It is possible for $\pi$ not to be faithful.  For instance, if $A = C(X)$ for a compact Hausdorff space $X$, if $\phi$ is the state induced by a probability measure supported on a proper subset $E$ (so again $H$ is one-dimensional), and if $f \in A$ is supported on $X \setminus E$, then $\pi(f) = 0$.  Similarly, if $A = A_1 \oplus A_2$ and $\phi = \phi_1 \oplus 0$, then $\pi(0,a_2) = 0$. In general, just by following through the details of the Stinespring construction, it looks like $\pi(a) = 0$ is equivalent to
$$
\forall b \in A: \, \phi(b^* a^* ab) = 0
$$
so that faithfulness of $\pi$ would be equivalent to the statement
$$
\forall a \in A: 
\Big( \, \forall b \in A: \, \phi(b^* a^* ab) = 0 \Big) \Rightarrow a =0
$$
or equivalently, of course,
$$
\forall a \in A: \, a \neq 0 \Rightarrow \exists b \in A: \, \phi(b^* a^* ab) \neq 0.

Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be a number field of degree $n$ with Galois group $G$. Let $\beta = \{y_1, \dots, y_n\}$ be an ordered basis for $\mathcal{O}_K$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. The norm $N_\beta(x_1, \dots, x_n) := N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x_1y_1 + \dots + x_ny_n)$ is a homogemeous polynomial in $x_1, \dots, x_n$; it is invariant under the action of $G$, hence its coefficients lie in $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}$. Of course $N_\beta$ depends on $\beta$. For instance, picking the basis $\{1, i\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ yields the usual form $x_1^2+x_2^2$, but picking the basis $\{1,1+i\}$ yields the form $(x_1+x_2)^2+x_2^2$. Two forms which come from the same algebraic number ring are related by the action of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, by $N_\beta(\mathbb{x}) = N_{g\cdot \beta}(g\cdot \mathbb{x})$ where $\mathbb x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$. Thus, to each number field $K$, we can associate canonically the homogeneous form $N_\beta(\mathbb x)$, up to the action of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. The form $N_\beta(\mathbb x)$ satisfies some pretty cool properties: It splits as a product of linear forms over $K$ (by definition of the norm!), hence the affine variety $V$ defined by $N_\beta=0$ over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is a union of $n$ hyperplanes. It is nonzero on ${\mathbb{Q}^*}^n$, because $y_1, \dots, y_n$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. It satisfies a ""multiplicative identity"" such as the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity , which reflects in a naive way the multiplicative structure of $K$.

125258,$C^2=A^2+B^2-2AB \cdot\cos(c)$ getting a different answer than creating a third triangle with the distance formula?,"I have the following triangle: The side going up has a length of 96, the side going down has a length of 112. The angle closest to the center is 91 degrees broken up into 62 and 29 degrees from the x-axis. I am trying to find the length of the third side. I was trying to use the formula $C^2=A^2+B^2-2AB *cos(c)$, but I seem to get a different answer than I should. I used the longest side as $C$, the side with the length of 96 as $B$, and the side with the length of 112 as $A$. When I use the above formula, the third side equals 148.8, however, If I were to do it by using 2 triangles and a distance formula (done bellow), I end up with 183.03 The second way I did it was as follows: For the top triangle: $\cos(62)\cdot96=45.1$ $\sin(62)\cdot96=84.8$ Therefor the top points coordinates are (+45.1, +84.8) For the Bottom triangle: $\cos(29)\cdot112=98.0$ $\sin(29)\cdot112=54.3$ Therefor the bottom point's coordinates are (+54.3, -98.0) Then I just plugged it into $A^2+B^2=C^2$ $\sqrt{(54.3-45.1)^2+(-98-84.8)^2}=\sqrt{(9.2)^2+(-182.8)^2}=183.03$ Which is totally different than: $\sqrt{(96)^2+(112)^2-2(96*112)\cdot\cos(91)}=148.8$ What am I doing wrong? Is the formula incorrect?","['trigonometry', 'triangles']"
125285,Is there a simple way to prove the Brouwer fixed Point theorem?,The quest may be for references but I want to know if there is a simple way to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem! That is if a function $f:\bar{B}\to\bar{B}$ is continuous then $f$ admits one fixed point! The answer for the $R¹$ is a real analysis exercise and it also holds for any interval compact! The proof is related with Schauder fixed-point theorem?,"['fixed-point-theorems', 'functional-analysis']"

125292,Uniformly Continuous Function sending Bounded Set to Unbounded One,"Let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,\rho)$ be metric spaces, and let $f: X \to Y$ be a uniformly continuous function. If $A \subset X$ is bounded, must $f(A) \subset Y$ be bounded? It is clear to me that in metric spaces that satisfy the Heine-Borel property, such as $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the answer to this question is yes. However, I can see no reason why this should hold for arbitrary metric spaces. Any ideas? Thanks!","['metric-spaces', 'analysis']"
