1660367,Differenciating a function with respect to another function confusion,"I am having problem solving the following question- Differenciate $\tan^{(-1)}{(\sqrt{1-x^2}/x)}$ with respect to $\cos^{(-1)}{(2x\sqrt {1-x^2})}$, where $x$ is not $0$. My attempt - I took the tan function as $a$ and cos one as $b$. Now we need ${(da/dx)/(db/dx)} $ So here if I substitute $x=\cos\theta$ or $x=\sin\theta$, da/dx is $-1/(\sqrt{1-x^2})$. Now for the second function if I substitute  $x=\cos\theta$ or $x=\sin\theta$ I dont get the same answer. Why is it so? My book has taken $x$ to be between $-1/\sqrt{2}$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$ for the second function and hence arrived at the answer 0.5.My book says $x=\sin\theta $ is correct and $x=\cos\theta $ is wrong.

1660570,Continued fraction analog to zeta function - how to properly define it and find its properties?,"I do not mean the continued fraction representation of zeta function; I mean the function which has the form: $$f(s)=\cfrac{1}{1^s+\cfrac{1}{2^s+\cfrac{1}{3^s+\cfrac{1}{4^s+\cdots}}}}$$ For some values, we know the function exactly: $$\begin{align*}
f(0)&=\phi-1=0.61803398875\ldots\\
f(1)&=\frac{I_1(2)}{I_0(2)}=0.69777465796\ldots\\

Here are the first few approximations, based on truncating the continued fraction: $$\begin{align*}
f_1(s)&=1\\
f_2(s)&=\frac{1}{1+2^{-s}}\\
f_3(s)&=\frac{2^s+3^{-s}}{1+2^s+3^{-s}}\\

Which of its properties can be found theoretically? Maybe it was already studied, then I would like some reference.

1660591,Bounding the ratio of the $l^1$ norms of two vectors to the ratio of their $l^2$ norms,"I am having difficulty proving or disproving a claim of the following type:
Suppose $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$, $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$ are sets of real numbers satisfying $0 < x_j \leq y_j$ for each $1 \leq j \leq n$, and suppose that $X := \sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} x_j^2$, $Y := \sum_{1\leq j \leq n} y_j^2$.  Do there exist absolute constants $c_1,c_2 > 0$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} x_j}{\sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} y_j} \leq c_1\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right)^{c_2}.
\end{equation*}
Evidently, this is interpretable as bounding the ratio of the $l^1$ norms of two vectors by a power of the ratio of their $l^2$ norms. Obviously, we have a trivial bound with $c_2 = 0$ has $c_1 = 1$, which is undesirable. A simple application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the numerator, and of the simple inequality $\left(\sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} y_j^2\right) \leq \left(\sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} y_j\right)^2$ in the denominator gives the bound with $c_2 = \frac{1}{2}$ but $c_1 = n^{\frac{1}{2}}$, which is not suitable, and furthermore, for large $n$ this is worse than the trivial bound mentioned above. \ In my particular application I am taking $n \rightarrow \infty$, my sequence $\{x_n\}_n$ (and thus $\{y_n\}_n$ as well), each term of which depends in some sense on $n$, is growing with $n$, and $\frac{\max_j x_j}{\min_j x_j} \rightarrow \infty$. The same properties are also true of $\{y_j\}_j$. For this reason, reverse Cauchy-Schwarz type inequalities such as that of Polya-Szego do not produce satisfactory improvements when $n$ is significantly larger than either of $X$ or $Y$. My feeling is that in such generality we ought to allow $c_1$ or $c_2$ to depend on the sequences in question to some degree, but not in a way that reduces to something trivial. For instance, $c_2 = \frac{1}{\log(Y/X)}$ and $c_1 = e$ reduces to the trivial bound by 1, and is thus not interesting. I welcome any help in this regard, though I would prefer that it be given in the form of a hint, rather than as an explicit proof or counterexample.
Thank you in advance. Update: I was actually able to prove this with $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = \frac{1}{4}$. It turns out in my application, however, that I need $c_2 = \frac{1}{2}$. It is clear that $\frac{1}{2}$ is best possible (e.g., by taking $x_1$ and $y_1$ very large compared to each of the remaining $x_j$ and $y_j$, or by allowing zero components and taking $\mathbf{x} := (x,0,\ldots,0)$ and $\mathbf{y} := (y,0,\ldots,0)$; these examples are obviously morally the same). Any absolute $c_1$ is allowable in my application, so any help with the case $c_2 = \frac{1}{2}$ is warmly welcome, even if it does not yield the best constant $c_1$.","['inequality', 'analysis']"

1660790,What is the difference between free groups and a free product?,"I am encountering free products for the first time in Algebraic Topology during the discussion of van Kampen's theorem, and I can't seem to tell the difference between a free product of groups, and a free group. The definition I know (of a free product) is: Let $G,H$ be groups. Define $G *H$ to be the set of all formal words $g_1h_1 \cdots g_nh_k$ where $g_i \in G$ and $h_j \in H$. Then $G*H$ is a group under the operation of juxtaposition, and the identity is the empty word. This definition can be extended to the free product of an arbitrary collection $G_\alpha$ of groups, but I don't see how this definition is different from the free group on a set $S$. My guesses at the differences: Free groups can be formed with any set $S$, whereas free products are defined for collections of groups . Free products respects relations between the groups. For example,  in $G*H$ the word $g_1g_2h_1$ is just $g_3h_1$ for some $g_3=g_1g_2 \in G$. Whereas there is no underlying relation for words in a free group (except for the formal cancellation of words). And one last questions: are all free groups also free products?

If it is true that we don't have a useful notion of such things, is there any reason why? This is of course a little vague and I am not really sure what answer would satisfy me. Edit: Specifically for reduced versions of morphisms, I think they should have the following properties: They should be affine. They should be closed under base change(pullback/fiber products) and composition. (More speculative) The property should be expressible purely as a property about the induced morphisms on the stalks.","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

1661094,Vector Bundles: Continuity of map between total space implies homeomorphism.,"In Spivak's ""A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry"" Spivak defines a vector bundle as a tuple: $(E, \pi, B, \bigoplus, \bigodot),$ where $E$ is the total space, $B$ is the base space, $\pi$ is a continuous map from $E$ onto $B$ (thought of as like a projection) and there are vector additions on each fiber, and scalar multiplication on the total space. Lastly, he gives a local trivialization condition. He says that two vector bundles over the same space are equivalent if there is a homeomorphism of the total spaces which takes fibers onto fibers. This is what he says is the definition of equivalence. In an exercise after this, he says that we do not need a homeomorphism - that if the map between total spaces is continuous, then the spaces are in fact homeomorphic. I don't even begin to see what's going on here. For manifolds in general, this is far from true - there is no reason continuity should say anything about the inverse map being continuous, and certainly not bijectivity. The only thing I can think of is that Spivak's question is worded a little poorly, and I should assume the map is continuous, and the fibers are taken isomorphically to fibers.  Even with this new information though, I still feel mostly lost. For example, why can't we send the whole total space to just a single point and fiber?

If $(x_n)\in S$, then $F(x_n)$ was said to be the “limit of the sequence $(x_n)$"" satisfying following two axioms: $A_1$: If $(x_n)$ is a constant sequence whose value is $a$, then $F(x_n)=a$. $A_2$: If $F(x_n)=a$, then for any sub-sequence of $(x_n)$ given by $(x_{n_k})$ we have $F(x_{n_k})=a$.

I am thinking a subsampling of a factor of $N$ in each of $D$ dimensions. In particular we want (as in the one dimensional case) perfect reconstruction. In the one dimensional case that is given by from Wavelet Tutorial source , page 19: 
$$\begin{align}H(z)H_i(z) + G(z)G_i(z) = 2&\\
H(-z)H_i(z) + G(-z)G_i(z) = 0&\end{align}$$
Or in matrix terms:
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}H_i(z)\\G_i(z)\end{array}\right] = \frac{2}{\det(H_m)} \left[\begin{array}{r}G(-z)\\-H(-z)\end{array}\right]$$ Wikipedia the following well known relation for the one dimensional case of biorthogonality: $$\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}a_n{\tilde a}_{n+2m} = 2 \delta_{m,0}$$ This basically means the convolution of $a$ and $\tilde a$ is the identity. How to expand this to more dimensions? I will give some of my thoughts, but I hope to be challenged and get counter proposals. Own work, or suspicions: Out of practicality let us replace tilde with an indexing vector $l$.
Let us denote the sequence of filters $a(l)_n$, $l\in {{\mathbb Z}_N}^D$. One expansion we can do is $$a([0,0,\cdots]) * a(l) = \delta, \forall l \neq [0,\cdots,0]$$ Where this $a([0,0,\cdots])$ is a mean-preserving filter. I think this would be compatible with separable transforms, but allow for increased freedom to design the high pass filters. Does it make sense? Observation 2: Note that the above are polynomial equations or systems of polynomial equations (the z-transforms $H,H_i,G,G_i$ of the filters). In one dimension these are one variable polynomials, but as the dimensionality increases, so does the number of variables of the polynomials. So if there exist similar constraints for the Z-transforms of filters for multi dimensional wavelets, they would lead to solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations.","['wavelets', 'algebraic-geometry', 'signal-processing', 'linear-transformations', 'linear-algebra']"

Unary operators : negation $-x$, square root $\sqrt{x}$ and integer factorial $x!$. Binary operators : +, -, ×, ÷, exponentiation $x^y$ and arbitrary roots $\sqrt[y]{x}$. If we extend the puzzle to arbitrary reals then it is clear by countability that some numbers can't be expressed precisely (though by Gelfond–Schneider some transcendental numbers can). However, for some potentially unexpressable numbers it is possible to express arbitrarily close estimates. For example 
$$e_n = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4!^{(n)} + \sqrt{4}}{4!^{(n)}} \right) ^{4!^{(n)}}}$$

1661818,A bird flies between two cars infinite times [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to turn this into an equation and then sum the series? (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . The following question and answer is taken from careerbless A naughty bird is sitting on top of the car. It sees another car
approaching it at a distance of 12 km. The speed of the two cars is 60
kmph each. The bird starts flying from the first car and moves towards
the second car,reaches the second car and come back to the first car
and so on. If the speed at which bird flies is 120kmph then 1)the total distance travelled by the bird before the crash is? 2)the
total distance travelled by the bird before it reaches the second car
for the second time is? 3)the total number of times that the bird
reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically)? I am clear with the explanation available in the mentioned site for 1 and 2. For the third part, i.e., the total number of times that the bird
reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically), answer given
is infinite times with the explanation proving the infinite
sequence. But we know it cannot go on infinite times. It has to be a finite number if we look at it practically. How to explain this? I am puzzled because the explanation looks convincing (infinite times) whereas we know it cannot be infinite times. Please help in understanding this contradiction. EDIT: Adding the explanation(below) from careerbless as advised by @DylanSp for clarify and my aim is to understand why it looks as infinite times(theoretically) whereas we know it is finite practically or where my understanding is wrong. (it was a detailed explanation and that is why I have not added initially) (3) infinite times As explained for the previous case, The bird reaches the second car in $\dfrac{12}{180}=\dfrac{1}{15}$ hour for the first time. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{15}×120=8$ km and therefore the distance between the cars
becomes 12-8=4 km. The bird reaches back the first car in $\dfrac{4}{180}=\dfrac{1}{45}$ hour. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{45}×120=\dfrac{8}{3}$ km and therefore the distance between
the cars becomes $4-\dfrac{8}{3}=\dfrac{4}{3}$ km. Now the bird flies to the second car for the second time. It takes $\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{4}{3}\right)}{180}=\dfrac{1}{135}$ hour for this. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{135}×120=\dfrac{8}{ 9}$ km and therefore the distance
between the cars becomes $\dfrac{4}{3}-\dfrac{8}{9}=\dfrac{4}{9}$ km. The bird reaches back the first car in $\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{4}{9}\right)}{180}=\dfrac{1}{405}$ hour. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{405}×120=\dfrac{8}{ 27}$ km and therefore the distance
between the cars becomes $\dfrac{4}{9}-\dfrac{8}{27}=\dfrac{4}{27}$ km. Now the bird flies to the second car for the third time. It takes $\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{4}{27}\right)}{180}=\dfrac{1}{1215}$ hour for
this. so on. Sine this goes on repeatedly, the bird reaches the bonnet of the

Also, all the broken diagonals add up to the same sum, making this a pandiagonal magic square. The square is like a torus -- by shifting rows or columns to the other edge, any square can be put at the center. Pick a number from the magic square, then shift about both squares so that your chosen number is at the center. Place a queen at the center of each square. Each queen will then cover one number, the same number, and attack 24 other numbers. Neither queen will attack the same number, and every number gets attacked on exactly one of the two squares. In combinatorics, this is known as the 2-(49,7,1) design. With 49 elements, in blocks of 7, any 2 items can be found in exactly 1 of the blocks.  Each of the two squares represents 7 rows, 7 columns, 7 left diagonals, 7 right diagonals, or 28 blocks in each square.  So 56 blocks in total.  This is also known as the Paley-49 graph. A similar trick can be done with 4x4 magic squares. A Rook-3 representation of 2-(9,3,1) exists, Lo Shu + (123)(456)(789). A restricted Queen-4 representation of 2-(16,4,1) exists where diagonal moves are only on main diagonals. A restricted Queen-5 representation of 2-(25,5,1) exists where diagonal moves are only left diagonals. A  Queen-7 representation of 2-(49,7,1) is shown above.

But what next? Am I doing this correctly and what do we do next if I am?","['minimal-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'field-theory']"

$$
X^t\eta + \eta X = 0.

\eta = \left(\begin{matrix}

1662269,What is the Probability that a Magic Coin will come up Heads at least 7 times in 10 throws?,"Please consider the following problem which came up when I was thinking
about modeling options. Problem: Suppose we have a magic two-sided coin. The probability it comes up
heads in a given throw is normally $0.5$. However, if it has come up heads
three times in the last three throws then the probability that it will come
up heads in the next throw drops to $0.25$. In addition, if it has come up
tails three times in the last three throws then the probability that it will
come up heads in the next throw is $0.75$. For the first three throws of the
coin the probability it will come up heads is $0.5$. If I throw this coin $10$ times, what is the probability that I will get at least $7$ heads? Here is my attempt to solve the problem. Let $E(c,h,t)$ be a function which tells us the expected number of heads in
$c$ throws given that we are on a run of $t$ heads and a run of $h$ heads. This
means that $t$ will equal 0 or $h$ will be zero. They will both be zero at
the start. For example, if the last three throws were heads, tails, tails then
$t$ would be $2$ and $h$ would be $0$. \begin{eqnarray*}
E(0,t,h) &=& 0 \\
E(1,0,t) &=& 0.5 \\
E(2,0,t) &=& 1 \\
E(3,0,t) &=& 1.5 \\

E(1,3,t) &=& 0.25 \\
E(2,2,t) &=& .5(1+0.25) + 0.5(.5) = .5(1.25) + .25 = 1.125  \\

(1 answer) Closed 7 years ago . Let $X\in\mathbb{A}^n$ and $Y\in\mathbb{A}^m$ be affine varieties (irreducible algebraic sets). Then, if we denote by $i_X$ and $i_Y$ their ideals in their respective affine spaces, we define their product in $\mathbb{A}^{n+m}$ as the set $$
X\times Y = \{(x,y):x\in X\text{ and } y\in Y\} = \{(x,y):x\in Z(i_X)\text{ and }y\in Z(i_Y)\}.
$$ Using the second characterization it's easy to show that in fact $X\times Y$ is closed in $\mathbb{A}^{n+m}$ and particularly that $X\times Y = Z(I_X+I_Y)$ , where $I_X$ and $I_Y$ are the vanishing ideals of $X\times\mathbb{A}^m$ and $\mathbb{A}^n\times Y$ (these ideals clearly are in bijective correspondence with $i_X$ and $i_Y$ , respectively). Then, by the Nullstellensatz, we get $I(X\times Y) = \sqrt{I_X+I_Y}$ .
