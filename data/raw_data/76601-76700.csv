964872,Describe the groups of homomorphisms of the given abelian groups,"In algebra we have the following problem to solve: Describe the groups of homomorphisms of abelian groups. (a) $\textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q} / \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q})$ (b) $\textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Q} / \mathbb{Z})$ So first of all, I'm not sure, if I really understand what to do. I assume that I just have to describe the group $\textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q})$,
This means that I have to define a group operation and then prove that it satisfies the group axioms, like closedness, associativity, existence of inverses element, existence of an identity element, etc. Is this idea correct? If so, I would define the operation like this: let $f,g \in \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q})$ then: $$(f\odot g)(x):=f(x)+g(x), \qquad \forall x\in \mathbb{Q}.$$ to check that this operation is closed, we have to show that $$f\odot g \in \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q}), \qquad \forall f,g \in \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q})$$ Proof: Let $f,g \in \forall f,g \in \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q})$. Then, $$\begin{array}{rclcl}
(f\odot g)(x+y)
    &=& f(x+y)+g(x+y) & \qquad & \text{(by def of $\odot$)} \\
    &=& f(x)+f(y)+g(x)+g(y) & & \\
    &=& f(x)+g(x)+f(y)+g(y) & & \\
    &=& (f\odot g)(x)+(f\odot g)(y). & & \text{($\forall x,y \in \mathbb{Q/Z}$)} 
\end{array}$$ This follows only if $\mathbb{Q}$ is abelian, which is obviously true. Also from this fact follows that: $$(f\odot g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)=g(x)+f(x)=(g\odot f)(x), \qquad \forall x \in \mathbb{Q/Z},$$
and hence $\textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Q/Z,Q})$ is abelian. It remains only to show that there exist inverses and an identity element.
As identity element we could take the embedding  $e: \mathbb{Q/Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}.$ For the inverse I did this:
$(f\odot g)(x)=e(x)=x$, $\forall x \in \mathbb{Q/Z}$ , so
$$(f\odot g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)=x$$
and so
$f(x)^{-1}:=g(x)=x-f(x)$ should be the inverse.
Is this correct, or am I completely on the wrong trail?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

964979,Exercise on posets and antichains in Steven Roman's Lattices and Ordered Sets,"I have just began reading through Steven Roman's "" Lattices and ordered sets "", and I came across an exercise in Chapter 1 that I can't seem to find a good answer to. All the others are fairly easy, so either I'm missing something trivial or maybe I misunderstand the question. 
The exercise is as following: ""Find a poset $P$ that contains an antichain $A=\{x,y,z\}$ with the property that no pair of elements from $A$ has a join but $A$ has a join."" (A join of a set is the same as the least upper bound for that set.) I'm struggling with the question, perhaps because of some ambiguity. To illustrate: suppose $P = \{\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ with $\leq$ being 'is a subset of' and the antichain $A = \{\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,3\}\}$ then $\{1,2,3\}$ is a join for $A$, but doesn't this imply that it is a join for $\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}$ as well? Although it is join for more than just this pair of elements, but still a valid join I'd say? So concluding from this, for finite $P$, if the antichain $A$ has a join $j$ then $j$ would be an upper bound for each of the pairs $\{\{x,y\},\{x,z\},\{y,z\}\}$ as well and so they definitely have a join, no? So that leaves just the infinite posets to think about, and I haven't really found an example that fulfills the criteria of the exercise.","['lattice-orders', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

965039,Explain this step in lecture notes,"The bounty offered is for the person that explains me how the author gets from equation 3.19 to equation 3.20 in these lecture see here . Normally I would agree that copying the relevant equation would be meaningful, but as this is a part of a longer proof, I think that you need to look at the context in order to understand the question.
 am thinking about a step in the proof of the equivalence of ensembles in StatMech on page 25. step from 3.19 to 3.20 . It seems to be argued there that for $A$ and $K$ large enough, the term $$\sum_{N=0}^{\infty} \int_{-Bn}^{\infty} 1_{\text{{N>K or u>A}}}(u)e^{-\beta |\lambda_m|(\frac{u}{2}+n)}du $$ becomes arbitrarily small (We have $N = \frac{n}{|\lambda _m|}$ and $|\lambda_m| = \int_{\lambda_m}dx$), as the essential thing is to replace this whole term by $e^{\beta |\lambda_m|p(\beta, \mu)}$. $\beta, B$ are larger than zero. Despite, I do not really trust this step cause if we assume that only $N>K$, then it seems to be necessary for this whole expression to converge that $B$ is in $(0,2)$. Thus, there seems to be an additional requirement regarding $B$ in this step. Does anybody see if there is an additional trick used here or am I just missing something? In particular, I doubt that $$\sum_{N=0}^{\infty} \int_{-Bn}^{0} 1_{\text{{N>K or u>A}}}(u)e^{-\beta |\lambda_m|(\frac{u}{2}+n)}du $$ converges in general. The thing is that if we assume $N>K$, then we have $$\sum_{N=K+1}^{\infty} \int_{-B \frac{N}{|\lambda_m|}}^{0} e^{-\beta |\lambda_m|(\frac{u}{2}+n)}du $$ and this expression converges even for large $K$ only if $B<2$, wouldn't you agree?- So I just don't understand this step.

965464,Existence of ultrafilters,"STATEMENT: An “ultrafilter” is a filter that is not properly contained in any other filter. Use Zorn’s
lemma to show that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter. PROOF: Let $F$ be the set of all filters that are contained in $X$. Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a chain in F. Then let us take $\mathcal{C}'=\bigcup_{C∈\mathscr{C}}C.$ Then, clearly, $\mathcal{C}'$ is an upper bound for $C$ since given any element, $B$, of our chain we have $ B\subseteq \mathcal{C}'$. Let $A,B∈\mathcal{C}'$. Since $A$ and $B$ are in $\mathcal{C}'$, they must be contained in some filter $\mathcal{F}. $Therefore, $A∩B∈\mathcal{F}$. It therefore follows that $A∩B∈C'$. Furthermore, if $A⊆D$ then since $A∈F$ we have that $D∈F$. So $D∈\mathcal{C}'$. So, $\mathcal{C}'$ is a filter. By Zorn's lemma we conclude that there is a maximal filter(i.e. an ultrafilter) in $F$. QUESTION: I wanted to see if there were any problems with my proof. First time using Zorn's lemma. I also wanted to see why that if given any ultrafilter in $X$ that if $A\subseteq
X$, then either $A$ is in the ultrafilter or $A^c$ is in the ultrafilter, but not both. Also the definition of filter in my case restricts the filter to not have the empty set.","['filters', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

z = \sin(\theta).
$. A general ellipsoid can then be written as $X = ax$, $Y = by$, $z = cz$. I'm trying to find the Jacobian that tells you how the sphere was transformed to the ellipsoid. In my mind, this involved computing the following matrix $

In order for $a^2$ + 5 to be divisible by 4, $a^2$ + 5 = 4p for p ≥ 1, 4p-5 must be a perfect square. Since $a^2$ is odd, therefore 4p-5 must be an odd value thus it is a square of another odd integer. 4p-5 = $(2n+1)^2$ = ($4n^2$ + $4n$ + 1)             Thus,$4p$ = $4n^2$ + $4n$ + $6$ => $p$= $n^2$ + $n$ + $1.5$ which shows that p is not an integer therefore 4p-5 cannot be a perfect square. Therefore, $a^2$ + 5 cannot be divisible by 4. Consider the case when a is even. $a$ = $2k$ for some integer k. Then $a^2$ = $4k^2$. Clearly, $a^2$ is divisible by 4.

It seems natural and intuitive but i am not able to write the clean proof explicitely in the general case. Do we need to put some further assumptions of $C$ ? Do you have any idea of how we can wite the proof explicitely ? Thank you.","['convex-analysis', 'conditional-probability', 'probability-theory', 'convex-optimization', 'probability']"
968160,Rank of projective module defined as the smallest $n$ such that $P$ is a direct summand of $R^n$,"Over a commutative ring $R$, the rank of a projective module $P$ is defined by looking at the map $\text{rank}(P) : \text{Spec}(R) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0$ given by $\mathfrak{p}\mapsto \text{rank}_{R_\mathfrak{p}}(P\otimes_RR_\mathfrak{p})$. This makes sense since $P\otimes_RR_\mathfrak{p}$ is projective over $R_\mathfrak{p}$, hence free because $R_\mathfrak{p}$ is local. This map is continuous, so it must be locally constant since $\mathbb{N}_0$ is discrete. If $\text{Spec}(R)$ is connected ( i.e. $R$ has no nontrivial idempotents) then this map is constant; finally, the rank of $P$ is defined to be this constant. Why can't we just define $\text{rank}(P)$ to be the least $n$ such that $P$ is a direct summand of $R^n$ (if $P$ is finitely-generated)? This is well-defined and doesn't require connectedness. Is this useful/used?","['modules', 'commutative-algebra', 'projective-module', 'abstract-algebra']"
