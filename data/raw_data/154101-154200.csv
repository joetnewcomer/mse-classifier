2597478,"Riemann zeta for real argument between 0 and 1 using Mellin, with short asymptotic expansion","The following would appear to be true. For real $0 < \sigma < 1,$ we seem to have a very satisfying sum minus integral limit,
$$  \zeta(\sigma)  \; \; = \; \;  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \; \; \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^\sigma}   \right) - \frac{n^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma} \; \; . $$ A little more detail in these examples: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \; \; \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt k}   \right) - 2 \sqrt n - \frac{1}{2 \sqrt n} + \frac{1}{24 n^{3/2}} \; \; = \; \; \zeta \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx -1.460354508809586  $$ $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \; \; \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt[3] k}   \right) - \frac{3 n^{2/3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2 \sqrt[3] n} + \frac{1}{36 n^{4/3}} \; \; = \; \; \zeta \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -0.973360248350782  $$ So, are the above items really really true (rather than wishful thinking), and, if so, given $0 < \sigma < 1,$ what real numbers $A = A(\sigma), B = B(\sigma),$  make the short asymptotic expansion below correct? $$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^\sigma}   \right) - \frac{n^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma} - A n^{-\sigma} + B n^{-1-\sigma} \; \; = \; \;  \zeta(\sigma) \; \; + \; \;  O(n^{-2-\sigma}) \; \; ? $$ Here is an estimate of $\zeta\left( \frac{1}{5} \right)$ using Daniel's expansion as far as the $3+\sigma$ term, ignoring $5+\sigma$: $$ \zeta(\sigma) =\left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^\sigma}   \right) - \frac{n^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma} - \frac{1}{2 n^\sigma} + \frac{\sigma}{12 n^{1 + \sigma}} - \frac{\sigma (1 + \sigma)(2 + \sigma)}{720 n^{3+\sigma}} + O \left( \frac{1}{n^{5 + \sigma}} \right)$$

2597498,"Given a smooth function $f:M\to [a,b]$, $f^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)$ are (immersed) submanifolds","Suppose that $(M,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $f:M\to [a,b]$ a smooth function such that $\|\nabla f\|$ is constant along each level set. Assume that $\forall c,d \in [a,b]$ and $\forall p \in f^{-1}(c)$ and $\forall q \in f^{-1}(d)$, 
$$d(p,f^{-1}(d))=d(f^{-1}(c),q).$$ 
Also we know that $a$ and $b$ are the only critical values and each of the level sets $f^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)$ has dimension less than $n-1$, where $n=\dim M$. Here $\nabla f$ is the gradient of $f$, that is defined as $df_p(v)=g(\nabla f, v)$, $\forall v \in T_pM$. Is that possible to show that $f^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)$ are (immersed) submanifolds of $M$, with these hypothesis? One can also prove that each level set $f^{-1}(c)$, where $c\in (a,b)$, is am embedded submanifold of dimension $n-1$. Also $\forall q \in f^{-1}(a)$ there exists a geodesic that minimizes the distance from $q$ to $f^{-1}(c)$ and this geodesic is orthogonal to each level set $f^{-1}(c)$ and eventually meets $f^{-1}(b)$. One has the same results about $\forall q \in f^{-1}(b)$.","['smooth-manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'morse-theory']"
2597511,Understanding Differential Forms as elements of a dual space,"So I have studied quite a bit of differential geometry and am comfortable with differential forms and related notions. Of late however, I have been spending time seeing if I actually understand the objects/concepts that I am using all the time. This has led me to investigate whether I understand what a differential form is. For our purposes here, let us suppose that everything is smooth. Originally, I had been satisfied with considering a differential form as a smooth section of the cotangent bundle, or as a basis vector for the cotangent space. This means however that for each point $p \in M$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold, a differential form $$\omega = \sum_{i_1 \cdots i_n =1}^n f_{i_1 \cdots i_n} dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge  dx^{i_n}$$ assigns to $p$ a corresponding linear functional, call it $\omega_p$. I want to make sure that I'm not just symbol pushing and actually understand this properly. Take for example, the 1-form $\omega = f(x) dx$, where $f$ is smooth. Then $\omega$ maps $p$ to the linear functional $\omega_p = f(p)dx$? I don't see how $f(p)dx$ is a linear functional.","['differential-forms', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
2597532,Does taking expected value of two sides of inequality maintain the inequality?,"As some operations are not necessarily valid for maintaining an inequality (such as raising both sides of $-2 < 2$ to an even power), I wondered if taking the expected value of both sides is actually fine. So, let's say $X$ is a random variable and $E[X^2] < \infty$ holds. Now, since $|x| < 1 + x^2$ holds for all $x \in \Bbb{R}$ (easy proof), then $E[|X|] < E[1 + X^2]$ Thanks.","['inequality', 'probability', 'expectation', 'random-variables']"

2597632,Prove that a relation is symmetric and anti-reflexive,"I have the set $V = \{ -n, -(n-1), -(n-2), ... , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... , n-2, n-1, n\}$ and the relation over it $xRy \iff x + y$ is a power of $3$ and I need to prove that it is symmetrical and anti-reflexive. So $x + y$ is the same as $y + x$, and if $x + y$ is a power of three then so is $y + x$, so then $xRy$ is the same as $yRx$ which would mean that the relation must be symmetrical. For the relation to be reflexive then $x + x$, would need to be a power of $3$, but $x + x = 2x$, which is an even number and so it can't be a power of $3$, and so $xRx$ doesn't hold, which means the relation is anti-reflexive.

2597648,Show the following PDE from the known nonlinear ODE and its solution?,"Suppose I have the following nonlinear ODE: $$\frac{dy}{dt}=F(y)$$ with $y(0) = z$ . Suppose the solution of this nonlinear ODE is $y(t,z)$ . Show the following: $$\frac{\partial y(t,z)}{\partial t}\Bigr\rvert_{z \text{ fixed }} -F(z)\frac{\partial y(t,z)}{\partial z} \Bigr\rvert_{t \text{ fixed }} =0$$ We can consider the simplest case such as $F(y) = y$ . And can solve $y(t) = ze^t$ and then plug into the partial differential equation. We have $F(z) = z$ . To formally prove this, I am not sure where to start with. I am also confused about the following, $$\frac{\partial y(t,z)}{\partial t}\Bigr\rvert_{z \text{ fixed }} = F(z)??$$ If this is true, then $\frac{\partial y(t,z)}{\partial z} \Bigr\rvert_{t \text{ fixed }} = 1$ , which does not make any sense obviously. The following is my new work on this: $$\int_z^y \frac{dy}{F(y)} = \int_{0}^t dt \Rightarrow G(y) - G(z) = t$$ where $$G(y) = \int \frac{dy}{F(y)}, \text{ which is a indefinite integral}$$ Now we have $$G(y) = t + G(z) \Rightarrow y(t,z) = G^{-1}(t + G(z))$$ where $$G^{-1}(y) = ?$$ I am a bit confused the following: Does the above derivation make sense? What is $G^{-1}$ here? I am also not quite sure the following? $$\frac{\partial G^{-1}(t+G(z))}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial G^{-1}(t+G(z))}{\partial (t+G(z))}\frac{\partial (t+G(z)))}{\partial t} = ? $$","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'nonlinear-system', 'partial-differential-equations']"

I know polynomials like $(x+i)(x+1)(x-1)$ have roots of unity as their roots. So, I have three questions: If we allow real coefficients, do we get any more polynomials with roots of unity roots?

2597752,"Is the arclength of $x\sin(\pi/x)$ in the interval $(0, 1)$ finite?","I'm having trouble determining the arclength of $x\sin(\pi/x)$ in the interval $(0, 1)$ (that is, determining if it converges or not). My first attempt was to write
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^1\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\text{d}x & = \int_0^1\sqrt{1 + \left(\sin\frac \pi x - \frac \pi x\cos\frac \pi x\right)^2}\text{d}x \\
& = \pi\int_1^\infty\sqrt{1 + (\sin x - x\cos x)^2}\frac{\text{d}x}{x^2}
\end{aligned}
$$ Then I wanted to consider the asymptotics function $\sqrt{1 + (\sin x - x\cos x)^2}$, but I can't find an easy way in. One thought was to write $$
\int_1^\infty\sqrt{1+(\sin x - x\cos x)^2}\frac{\text{d}x}{x^2} > \int_1^\infty\left|\frac{\sin x}{x^2} - \frac{\cos x}x\right|\text{d}x
$$ Next, we notice that $x\cos x + \sin x = 0$ occurs approximately when $x = (k+1/2)\pi$ ($k\in\mathbb{N}$), since these points are the points where $x = \tan x$, and as $x$ increases (so that the function $x$ is higher along the $y$-axis), the function $\tan x$ gets closer and closer to its vertical asymptote, which occurs at $(k+1/2)\pi$, so the intersection of the two functions also occurs close to that asymptote. So we consider 
$$
\int_{(k-1/2)\pi}^{(k+1/2)\pi}\frac{|\sin x - x\cos x|}{x^2}\text{d} x \ge \frac1{[(k+1/2)\pi]^2}\int_{(k-1/2)\pi}^{(k+1/2)\pi}|\sin x - x\cos x|\text{d} x
$$ This is where I get stuck, as I'm not sure how to estimate that integrand. I assume it will be approximately linear in $k$, but I'm not sure how to prove that. If that's true, then the integral is greater than a term that behaves like $\frac 1k$, meaning the original integral is greater than a harmonic sum, and so diverges. So first question: how can I evaluate the integral on the RHS of the inequality above? Second question: I also feel like there's an easier way of thinking about this problem that I'm missing. Any ideas? Edit: I just realized that using $\int |f| \ge |\int f|$, we get
$$
\int_{(k-1/2)\pi}^{(k+1/2)\pi}|\sin x - x\cos x|\text{d} x \ge \left|\int_{(k-1/2)\pi}^{(k+1/2)\pi}(\sin x - x\cos x)\text{d}x\right| = |2\pi k\cos(\pi k)| = 2\pi k
$$ However, this doesn't completely answer my question. Yes, it's a solution to the integral, but the argument that we should only look at the intervals $[(k-1/2)\pi, (k+1/2)\pi]$ is kind of handwavy, and it still feels like there should be an easier solution.","['real-analysis', 'improper-integrals', 'arc-length']"

Proof for $551$ : Every rectangle is uniquely determined with two parallels with x-axis and two parallel with y-axis. Since we have $11$ parallel lines with x-axis, we can chose those on ${11\choose 2}=55 $ ways. So we have two parallels to x-axis with at least $11$ rectangles with sides on these two parallels. Now let us observe only these $11$ rectangles. Each is uniquely determined with their left and right side.

Since $f$ is differentiable(and hence continue) we have a differential equation $$f'(x) - f(x) = -S$$ whose  homogenous solution is $f_h(x) = ce^x$ for some constant $c$. Since the particular solution is $f_p(x) = S$, it follows that $c =0$. From this we conclude that the solution is  $f(x) = S$ for all $x\in (0,1)$.

What is the formula to calculate the extrinsic distance between two points $(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)$ and $(\sigma_1',\sigma_2')$. That is the straight line in 3 dimensions, written only in terms of the intrinsic metric?

My guess would be it would be an integral of some functional of $g$ on a curve between the two points on the surface. $L=\int F[g].d\sigma$. If such a formula could exist.

As an example, take a sphere with the sphere metric and then the distance we're looking for is the distance between two points on a sphere with a straight line going inside the sphere.)

An analytic surface is one in which the surface can be expressed as functions which can be expanded as taylor series - not piecewise surfaces such as the bump function.

2598663,Normal coordinate charts in Riemannian manifolds and relationship between two definitions of tangent space.,"Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and $p\in M$ a point. Let $E_{i}$ be an orthonormal basis of $T_{p}M$ and let $E\colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to T_{p}M$ be the isomorphism sending $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}E_{i}$. On a normal neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ (that is, the image under the exponential map $\exp_{p}$ of a star shaped open neighborhood of $0\in T_{p}M$) we can define a coordinate chart by $\varphi =E^{-1}\circ \exp_{p}^{-1}\colon U\to \mathbb{R}^{n}$. As with any other chart, the basis $\frac{\partial }{\partial x_{i}}$ of $T_{0}\mathbb{R}^{n}$ pulls back to a basis $\frac{\partial }{\partial x_{i} }|_{p}$ of $T_{p}M$. Is this pullback the orthnormal basis that we started from? My attempt: let $f\in C^{\infty }(M)$. We have to show that $E_{i}(f)=\frac{\partial }{\partial x_{i} }|_{p}(f)$. By definition: $$\frac{\partial }{\partial x_{i} }|_{p}(f)=\frac{\partial( f\circ \exp_{p}\circ E)}{\partial x_{i} }(0)$$ I guess now I need to deal with the definition of the exponential map explicitly, but I am not sure on how to do this. So first $E$ sends $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}E_{i}$. Then the exponential map sends a vector $v\in T_{p}M$ to $\gamma_{v}(1)$, where $\gamma_{v}$ is a geodesic with $\gamma_{v}(0)=p$ and $\dot{\gamma_{v} }(0)=v$. How do I use this now? I don't even know how geodesics look like without knowing the Riemannian metric $g$. For example, the point $(1,0,\ldots,0)$ is sent first to $E_{1}$ and then we take the geodesic $\gamma$ with $\gamma(0)=p=(0,\ldots,0)$ (using the expression of the point in the normal coordinate chart) and $\dot{ \gamma}(0)=E_{1}$. Now $\gamma(1)$ should be the point in the trajectory of $\gamma $ at time 1, and I guess if we track $\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via the normal coordinates then this point should correspond to $(1,0,\ldots,0)$, but I am already not sure of these claims. This also led me to the following question: In a chart $(V,\psi)$ with $\psi(p)=0$, is it true that $\frac{\partial }{\partial x_{i} }|_{p}=\dot{ \gamma }(0)$ for any curve $\gamma $ in $M$ with $\gamma(0)=p$ and such that $\psi(\gamma)$ has speed $1$ in the positive direction of the $x_{i}$ axis? EDIT (current thoughts on the questions) : I suspect now that the answer to the first question is positive and I suspect it will follow from the differential of the exponential map at $p$ being the identity on $T_{p}M$. But I still couldn't manage to write down a formal argument. Regarding the second question, I still didn't find an answer and I still very interested in finding one. I think that there are at least two ways of defining the tangent space of $M$ at a point $p$, one with this abstract derivations and the other one by considering derivatives of curves in the manifold passing through $p$ at time $0$. I have never worked with this definition, but after thinking about the second question I got to the following conclusion: isn't that second question precisely the relation between these two definitions of the tangent space?","['smooth-manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

There have to be exactly 10 full cycles of winding in total independent of its height. Attempt to solve We can define our curve in the form of a parametric equation: $$ r(t)=\begin{bmatrix} r\cos(\frac{20\pi t}{l}) \\ r\sin(\frac{20}{l}) \\ t \end{bmatrix} $$ where $l$ and $r$ are constants, and $x,y,z$ are unit vectors. $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} $$ Plot of $r(t)$ when $l=10,r=3$ & plot of reference cylinder Now we want to define a function for the length when the parametric equation is known.

The proof of above theorem is easier with some tools in algebraic topology. While understanding the proof, I came across a point in algebraic part of proof. The proof is broadly as follows. (i) suppose $f(x)\neq x$ $\forall x$. The line $t\mapsto (1-t)x+tf(x)$ intersects $\partial D^n$ in exactly two points. (ii) Let $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ be the two points of above line which are on $\partial D^n$. (iii) Then $x\mapsto g_1(x)$ or $x\mapsto g_2(x)$ is continuous map and one of them is retraction of $D^n$ to $\partial D^n$. (iv) Apply homological technique to get contradiction. Hence $f(x)=x$ for some $x$. Question. Are both $g_1$ and $g_2$ retractions or only one of them is retraction? Partial answer. $(1-t)x+tf(x)=x-t(x-f(x))$will lie on $\partial D^n$ iff $\| x-t(x-f(x))\|=1$
$$\mbox{ i.e. } t^2.\|x-f(x)\|^2-2t\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle+\|x\|^2=1.\hskip5mm(*)$$
The discriminant of above quadratic equation in $t$ is 
$$\Delta=4\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle^2-4(\|x\|^2-1).\|x-f(x)\|^2$$
Easy to show: $\Delta>0$ for all $x\in D^n$.
Thus for (*), there are two values of $t$ for each $x$ namely 
$$t_1=\frac{2\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\|x-f(x)\|^2} \mbox{ and } t_2=\frac{2\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\|x-f(x)\|^2}.$$
Let $$g_1(x)=(1-t_1)x+t_1f(x) \mbox{ and } g_2(x)=(1-t_2)(x)+t_2f(x).$$
What I saw was that when $x\in \partial D^n$ then $g_2(x)=x$ i.e. $g_2$ is a retraction. I was not getting that $g_1(x)=x$ for $x\in \partial D^n$; am I right? This is exactly the question I asked above before partial answer. Also, algebraically can we simplify some arguments to decide which $g_i$ is retraction?

2599332,Number of directional orders for $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$?,"Imagine there is some set $X$ of $n$ points (different) in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The number of (linear) orders we could define for them is just $n!\approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n$. Some of these orders can be defined alongside some direction: by projection on some unitary vector $v$: we take scalar products $(v\cdot x^i)_{i=1..n}$ for all these points and use the natural order for these real numbers. It defines an interesting equivalence relation on the sphere of directions: $v\sim_X u$ iff they define the same order in $X$. Such regions should be connected (and ""convex""?). Let's discard their boundaries, which are generic situations: take only directions for which projections of all points are pairwise different. The question is what is the number of such directional orders e.g. for a $d$-dimensional cube? Upper bound? Probability distribution for points of random positions? If all points are in one line, there are just 2 different directional orders  (the regions are two half-spheres). So the main question is upper bound - denote the maximal number of directional orders as $M_{n,d}$. Some obvious values are $M_{n,1}=2$, or for $d\geq n-1$ we have simplex: $M_{n,d}=n!$. Is there a general formula for $M_{n,d}$? Recurrence? Update: just made some numerics in Mathematica for $M_{n,d}$, (e.g.: 
""MatrixForm[Table[x = RandomReal[1, {n, d}];   CountDistinct[Table[v = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, d]; Ordering[x.v], {i, 100000}]], {n,10}, {d, 10}]]""). For $d=2$ and $n=1,\ldots,10$, we get looking certain: 1,2,6 , 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90 ... which can be guessed: $M_{n,2}=n(n-1)$ with exception of $M_{1,2}=1$. This formula suggests that we can choose e.g. first two vertices and the rest follow, but it's more complicated. For $d=3$ we get: 1,2,6,24 , 72, 172?, 352?, 642?, 1072?, 1690? (the last ones may be still increased - tested 10 sets for million directions) - the first four are factorials, but I don't see a formula for the following? For $d=4$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120 , 480, ~1404, ~3488, ~7516, ~14374. For $d=5$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720 ,3600, ~10500, ~29000, ~62000. For $d=6$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720,5040 , 30240?, ~70000, ~260000. Numerics suggest that the number varies among different sets of points with random positions, leading to further questions e.g. of characterization of sets of points maximizing the number of directional orders? Update: Searching just below diagonal might be helpful, e.g. ""adding one point to simplex"": $M_{n,n-2}=(n-1)!\cdot(n-2) $ checked for $n=3,4,5,6,7$ ... (?) Update: For cubes ($n=2^d$) and dimensions 1,2,3,4, the number of directional orders is correspondingly: 1, 8, 96, 5376. Update: We can tell a lot about boundaries of the regions. E.g. generic $d$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ form unique hyperplane, and its $\pm$normal directions are two vertices of the boundary between $d!$ regions of equivalence of $\sim_X$ relation: with infinitesimal perturbation we can choose any order among these $d$ points. Analogously $d-1$ points define lines at the boundary - between $(d-1)!$ regions. For such boundary as CW-complex , we would like to apply general Euler formula : $$1-(-1)^d=\chi=k_0-k_1+k_2-\ldots-(-1)^d k_{d-1}$$ where $k_0$ is the number of vertices, $k_1$ edges and so on, finally allowing to calculate the number of our regions/orders as $k_{d-1}$. In generic case, every $d$ vertices define hyperplane and so two vertices of the complex: $k_0=2{n \choose d}$. For $k_1$ we choose $d-1$ vertices in ${n\choose d-1}$ ways - plane going through them defines 1D circle on the sphere. Projecting on two dimensional space orthogonal to such plane, these $d-1$ points become one point there, getting situation with $n-d+2$ points in 2D. Hence, the total number of arcs seems $k_1={n\choose d-1}M_{n-d+2,2}$ (?). Analogously $k_i={n\choose d-i} M_{n-d+1+i,1+i}$ (?), what also agrees for $k_0$, and allows to get recurrence thanks to Euler formula: $$M_{n,d}=^?(-1)^d \left((-1)^d-1 +\sum_{i=0}^{d-2} (-1)^i {n\choose d-i} M_{n-d+1+i,1+i}  \right) $$ Unverified - I will probably go back to it in a few days.","['order-theory', 'geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series']"
2599351,Count the possible ways to seat people at a round table,"I have a very simple combinatorics problem, and I am (almost) sure I did this right. However, the smartest guy in my class thinks different and this made me doubt, so I will post our views to this problem and I would like to know who is right. In how many different ways can 10 people be seated around a round table, under the condition that there are 5 man and 5 women, and no two males or two females can be seated adjacently. My view We number the chairs in an arbitrary way, so the chair numbering is fixed. At chair $1$, there is seated either a man or a woman, which given $2$ possibilities. When we observe the gender of the person in the first chair, the division of the table over the two genders in given. Then there are $5!$ ways to seat the men over the $5$ male chairs and $5!$ ways to seat the women over the $5$ female chairs. So in total this gives $2.(5!)^2$ possibilities. My classmates view First all males are seated, which is possible in $5!$ ways. Because no males can sit adjacently and the people are seated in a circle, we can rotate the table and in this way we count all possibilities 5 times too much, so $5!/5=4!$ ways to seat the man. After this, the table division is fixed, but we still have to seat the women. This gives another $5!$ ways, so in total $5!4!$ ways. What I think is wrong with this view I don't think the argument about rotation of the table makes any sense. The argument can make sense though, if we use exactly my classmate's argument, but acknowledge that the first person to be seated can be any of the $10$ people, so giving an extra $10$ possibilities. Then proceed as my classmate, giving the same answer as me. However, my classmate does not agree. So who is right? Also, if we use our arguments to the same problem but a table of $2$ people, one male, one female, there are obviously $2$ possibilities. Then my method gives $2.(1!)^2=2$ possibilities, but my classmate's method gives only $1!0!=1$ possibility. EDIT I think the main problem is in different interpretations of the problem, where my interpretation is that it matters who sit at 'chair 1' while my classmates thinks that only the ordering of the people matters.

Suppose we have an even integer $n$, then the conjecture tells us that you can express it in the form of $n=2p+g$, where $p$ and $g$ are some prime and some prime gap $\geq0$(respectively). When saying prime gap, I'm talking about the distance between $p$ and another equal or greater prime, not just to the following prime. Ex. $4=2\cdot2+0$(two times the prime $2$ plus the gap between $2$ and $2$), $6=2\cdot3+0$, $8=6+2$ ($6$ from $2\cdot 3$, and $2$ from the gap between $3$ and $5$). Is this conjecture true? The reversed version, proving that $2p+g\in 2\mathbb{N}$ is an easy step, just knowing that $g$ is a difference between $p$ and a greater prime, and hence even for all $p>2$, and that $2$ times an integer is always even, we can conclude that $2p+g$ is even, but the conjecture states the reverse of this, namely, to prove that every even number has this form.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

We say that $\mu$ is $G$-invariant, if $\mu(gA)=\mu(A)$ for all $g\in G$ and $A\in\Sigma$. Now, I'm interested in $\Omega:=\Bbb R^n$, $\Sigma$ the Borel $\sigma$-Algebra of $\Omega$, $G=SO(n)$ the special orthogonal group. (We use the term rotation invariant for $SO(n)$-invariant from now on.) Im wondering, how many measures are rotation invariant, if they are (joint) probability distributions of independent and identically distributed ( iid. for short) random variables. I only identified Gaussian and Dirac measures (respectively with expectation zero) with this property, yet. More precisely speaking: Question: If $\mu:=\nu\otimes\nu\ldots\otimes\nu$ ($n$-times) for a probability (Borel-)measure $\nu$ on $\Bbb R$ is rotation invariant, is it already necessary for $\mu$ to be a Gaussian measure or a Dirac measure (and thus, the same for $\nu$) with expectation zero? My attempt (which actually inspired my above-mentioned question): Even for two real-valued random variables with Lebesgue-densities this is not easy for me to answer.
Let be $X,Y$ real random variables iid. via a continuous Lebesgue-density $f$, meaning the probability measure $\mu$ of $X,Y$ is given by $d\mu=fd\lambda$ for the Lebesgue-measure $\lambda$. Because of independency the Lebesgue-density of the product measure $\mu^2:=\mu\otimes\mu$ is given by $f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f(x)f(y)$. Now, if $\mu^2$ is rotation invariant, $$f(r\cos(\alpha))\cdot f(r\sin(\alpha)) = f(r)\cdot f(0)$$ must hold for all $r\geq 0$ and all $\alpha\in\Bbb R$. Even without restricting $f$ to fulfill $\int fd\lambda=1$, which functions (except the trivial case that $f$ is constant) fulfill this equality at all?
Clearly, all scalar multiples of the gaussian density with expectation zero $f(x;\sigma^2)=e^{-\frac12\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}$ accomplish that. Is there any other function class?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability-distributions']"

For example, say the player of a game scores points based on the value of the above dice they roll (whose r.v. is $X$), according to: $$f(X) = X^2 + 2X + 2 $$ For the dice: $X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ or $6$. And of course $\Bbb P(X = x_{1-6}) = 1/6$ Calculating $f(X)$ for the dice's values, the possible points you can score are: $5, 10, 17, 26, 37$ and $50$.

Would it be accurate too to say that the score $f(X)$ is itself a random variable?

The paper provides an answer to the problem for the purpose of comparing that answer with the impressions of test subjects to whom the problem was posed. The average heights of adult males and females in the US are, respectively, 5 ft 10 in. and 5 ft 4 in. Both distributions are approximately normal with a standard deviation of about 2.5 in.
An investigator has selected one population by chance and has drawn from it a random sample.
What do you think are the odds that he has selected the male population if
(i) the sample consists of a single person whose height is 5 ft 10 in.?
(ii) the sample consists of 6 persons whose average height is 5 ft 8 in.?
........ The correct odds are 16 in case (i) and 29 in case (ii). Bayes Theorem and the Gaussian PDF give odds of 17.8 and 317 for cases (i) and (ii), calculations below.  Since the problem provides a population standard deviation, using a sample standard deviation adjustor does not seem in order.  However, in case(ii) I checked a few adjustors $\sigma_{adj} = \sigma \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n}{n-k}}$ for $k = 1$ (Bessel's correction) and $k=1.5$ (alternative correction for normal distribution).  Neither returned the authors' given answer, although each moved the calculated odds in that direction. The provided answer for case(ii) IS obtained using an adjustor based on k=2.5! The question: what method could the authors be using that would provide their stated answer?  Why would k=2.5 be used? Solution using Bayes Theorem and the Gaussian PDF Case (i) Using Bayes Theorem $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Assuming $P(male)=P(female)$ which is not explicitly stated in the problem ...

$$odds=\frac{P(male | 5'10)}{P(female | 5'10)}=\frac{P(5'10 | male)}{P(5'10 | female)}$$

$$\frac{P(5'10 | male)}{P(5'10 | female)}=\frac{{\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot 2.5}e^\frac {-(70-70)^2}{2\cdot 2.5^2}}}{{\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot 2.5}e^\frac {-(70-64)^2}{2\cdot 2.5^2}}}=\frac{{e^0}}{{e^{-2.88}}}=17.8$$
$$$$ Case (ii) Applying the same methodology to case (ii) with an adjusted $\sigma=\frac{2.5}{\sqrt6}=1.0206$ gives $$odds=\frac{P(5'8\,avg | male)}{P(5'8\,avg | female)}=\frac{{\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot 1.0206}e^\frac {-(68-70)^2}{2\cdot 1.0206^2}}}{{\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot 1.0206}e^\frac {-(68-64)^2}{2\cdot 1.0206^2}}}=\frac{{e^{-1.92}}}{{e^{-7.68}}}=317.4$$ $$$$
So there is a small difference (17.8 vs. 16) from the given answer in case (i) and a very large difference (317 vs. 29)in case (ii). What method could be arriving at the stated answers of 16 and 29?","['statistics', 'probability']"
2599878,Count the number of ways in which these stamps can be posted on the envelope.,"The postal stamps of three different valuations viz $2$ cents, $3$ cents and $4$ cents are available. If the number of ways in which these stamps can be posted on envelope one after the other so that the total valuation of stamps on the envelope is $10$ cents is $N$. Find $N$. I have actually solved the problem using the method given below.
Consider the function $$f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)+f(n-4)$$ where $f(n)$ represents the ways in which stamps so arranged give the sum as $n$ on the envelope.  Hence we need to find $f(10)$. Now on quick brute force we get $f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=2$ and $f(5)=2$.
Using these I got $f(10)$ as $17$ which is the correct answer. But I want to solve this problem using the binomial coefficient method.  For example the answer to this question must be equal to the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $$(x^0+x^2+x^4+x^6+x^8+x^{10})(x^0+x^3+x^6+x^9)(x^0+x^4+x^8)$$ But using this I get the coefficient of $x^{10}$ as $5$ which isn't the correct answer. Can someone please check my method and place your suggestions over how should I continue in this method. Note : I think that many similar questions might have been asked on MSE but I am focusing on just one particular method to solve such problem. So please don't mark it as duplicate.","['generating-functions', 'combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"
