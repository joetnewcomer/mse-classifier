2472205,Is every number a sum of $3$ tetrahedral numbers?,"It is known that every number can be represented by a sum of $3$ triangular numbers. According to Gauss (see formula $35$ in mathworld article )
$$
\text{num}=\Delta+\Delta+\Delta

I did some numerical experiments that suggest the above formula is correct when triangular numbers are replaced by tetrahedral numbers
$$
\Delta=\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}6

2472402,Prove that every compact metric space is separable,"I'm in high school and self-studying analysis. I completed this proof for a problem in Rudin, but wanted some verification. Does this look correct? Proof that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base and is therefore separable: Consider $p \in K$ with an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0.$ By the Archemedian Principle, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \epsilon.$ Consider the open cover $$K \subset \bigcup_{i \in K} N_{\frac{1}{n}}(i).$$ Since $K$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover $$K \subset \bigcup_{i \in X_n} N_{\frac{1}{n}}(i),$$ where $X_n = \{x_{1_n}, x_{2_n}, x_{3_n}, ... x_{j_n}\} \subset K$ for some $j_n \in \mathbf{N}.$ Since $p \in K$, $p \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x_{i_n})$ for some $x_{i_n} \in X_n$. This means that $d(p, x_{i_n}) \leq \frac{1}{n}$, which also implies that $x_{i_n} \in N_\frac{1}{n}(p) \subset N_{\epsilon}(p),$ so $x_{i_n} \in N_{\epsilon}(p).$ Since $x_{i_n}$ is a member of $X_n$, $N_{\epsilon}(p)$ thus intersects the finite subset $X_n$. As the choices for $p \in K$ and $\epsilon$ were arbitrary, any neighborhood around every point in $K$ must intersect a countable subset $X$. By definition of closure of a set, $K \subset$ cl$(X)$.  This means that $X$ is dense in $K$ and thus forms a countable base. Therefore $K$ is separable.","['separable-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'compactness', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

2472467,Algebraic Geometry: What am I doing wrong?,"This may be a very stupid question. But please explain what I am doing  wrong. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $f\in k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$. Let $$D(f)=\mathbb{A}^n\setminus Z(f)$$
Then $D(f)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ is open. We can consider $\mathbb{A}^n$ as a subavariety of $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$. Consider the polynomial ring of $n+1$ variables $k[x_1,\dots, x_n, y]$ which corresponds to $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$. We know that $Z(fy-1)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ is homeomorphic to $D(f)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$. This means that we can consider $D(f)$ as a closed subset of $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$. Fact from topology: Let $C\subseteq Y\subseteq X$. If $C$ is closed in $X$, then $C$ is closed in $Y$. Since $D(f)$ is closed in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$, shouldn't it be closed in $\mathbb{A}^n$?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2472474,"Nielsen & Chuang, Problem 2.2 — Properties of the Schmidt number","I started reading the Nielsen & Chuang's Quantum Computation and Quantum Information . I got stuck by the last question of Problem 2.2. I got the other problems, but I can't see this one. I guess it's not really difficult, but as I am new in this field, some help will be nice. :) Problem statement: Suppose $|\psi\rangle $ is a pure state of a composite system with components $A$ and $B$ , such that: $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha \rvert \phi \rangle + \beta \rvert \gamma \rangle$$ Prove that: $$ \operatorname{Sch}(\psi) \geq | \operatorname{Sch}(\phi) - \operatorname{Sch}(\gamma)|$$ where $\operatorname{Sch}(x)$ is the Schmidt number of the pure state labeled $x$ . My attempt: Here is what I tried. Let's assume that $ \operatorname{Sch}(\phi) > \operatorname{Sch}(\gamma)$ . If we write the Schmidt decomposition of $\phi$ and $\gamma$ : \begin{align*}
| \phi \rangle &= \sum_i \phi_i | a_i^{\phi} \rangle | b_i^{\phi} \rangle\\
| \gamma \rangle &= \sum_i \gamma_i | a_i^{\gamma} \rangle | b_i^{\gamma} \rangle,
\end{align*} we can then calculate the partial trace of $\psi$ regarding component $A$ : $$
\rho  \equiv \operatorname{tr}_B(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |) = |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + |\beta|^2 \rho_{\gamma \gamma} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} + \bar{\alpha} \beta \rho_{\gamma \phi},
$$ where: $$
\rho_{\phi \phi} \equiv \operatorname{tr}_B(| \phi \rangle \langle \phi |) = \sum_i \phi_i^2 | a_i^{\phi} \rangle  \langle a_i^{\phi} | \\
\rho_{\gamma \gamma} \equiv \operatorname{tr}_B(| \gamma \rangle \langle \gamma |) = \sum_i \gamma_i^2 | a_i^{\gamma} \rangle  \langle a_i^{\gamma} | 
\\
\rho_{\phi \gamma}\equiv \operatorname{tr}_B(| \phi \rangle \langle \gamma |) = \sum_i \phi_i | a_i^{\phi} \rangle  \sum_j \gamma_j \langle b_j^{\gamma} | b_i^{\phi} \rangle \langle a_j^{\gamma} | \\
\rho_{\gamma \phi}\equiv \operatorname{tr}_B(| \gamma \rangle \langle \phi |) = \sum_i \gamma_i | a_i^{\gamma} \rangle  \sum_j \phi_j \langle b_j^{\phi} | b_i^{\gamma} \rangle \langle a_j^{\phi} |.
$$ It can be seen that $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\phi \gamma})$ is a subspace of $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\phi})$ , and similarly that $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\gamma \phi})$ is a subspace of $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\gamma})$ . We define $ P_{\gamma} $ the projector onto $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\gamma})$ and $$
P_{\gamma}^{\perp} = I - P_{\gamma}
$$ the projection onto the orthogonal complement of $\operatorname{Im}(\rho_{\gamma})$ . As $\operatorname{Sch}(\gamma)  < \operatorname{Sch}(\phi)$ , the subspace corresponding to $P_{\gamma}^{\perp}$ is not reduced to the zero vector.
We end up with: $$
\rho = P_{\gamma}( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + |\beta|^2 \rho_{\gamma \gamma} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} + \bar{\alpha} \beta \rho_{\gamma \phi} ) + P_{\gamma}^{\perp} ( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} ).
$$ As the subspaces corresponding to the two defined projectors are orthogonal: \begin{align*}
\operatorname{rank}(\rho) &= \operatorname{rank}(P_{\gamma}( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + |\beta|^2 \rho_{\gamma \gamma} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} + \bar{\alpha} \beta \rho_{\gamma \phi} ))\\
&+ \operatorname{rank}(P_{\gamma}^{\perp} ( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} )) \\
&\geq \operatorname{rank}(P_{\gamma}^{\perp} ( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} )),
\end{align*} I was hoping to conclude by claiming that: $$
\operatorname{rank}(P_{\gamma}^{\perp} ( |\alpha|^2 \rho_{\phi \phi} + \alpha \bar{\beta} \rho_{\phi \gamma} )) \geq \operatorname{Sch}(\phi) - \operatorname{Sch}(\gamma),
$$ but it is not correct, as I find counterexamples. Therefore I don't think that I am following the right track.",['linear-algebra']

Context: According to every text book that I've read on the subject, in order to guarantee global asymptotic stability, (1) and (2) are not enough: I also need 
$\lim_{||\mathbf{x}|| \to \infty} V(\mathbf{x}) = \infty$ (or, equivalently, that every subset of V is bounded). However, when I read the proof of local asymptotic stability, it seems to me that if (1) and (2) apply to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then asymptotic stability should also apply to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$.","['stability-in-odes', 'lyapunov-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"
2472626,Condition for the generic fiber to be dense,"This is an assertion in the article Groupes Reductifs sur un Corps Locale II by Bruhat and Tits.  Here $A$ is an integral domain with field of fractions $K$, and $\mathfrak X$ is an affine $A$-scheme with coordinate ring $B := A[\mathfrak X]$. I don't think this assertion that density is equivalent to torsion free is true in the generality they state.  I can show $\Rightarrow$ if $B$ is reduced. Density means that for any $b\in B$ which is not in the nilradical of $B$, there exists a prime $\mathfrak p$ of $B$ such that $b \not\in \mathfrak p$ and $\phi^{-1}\mathfrak p = (0)$. Scratchwork: Assume $B$ is reduced.  For the implication $\Rightarrow$, assume $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ are both not zero.  We need to show that $\phi(a) b \neq 0$.   Then $b$ is not nilpotent, which means the open set $D(b)$ is nonempty.  By density, there exists a prime $\mathfrak p$ of $B$ such that $b \not\in \mathfrak p$ and $\phi^{-1}\mathfrak p = (0)$.  Since $\phi(a)$ and $b$ each do not lie in $\mathfrak p$, neither does $\phi(a)b$, so $\phi(a)b \neq 0$. The implication $\Leftarrow$ is a standard result: an injective ring homomorphism makes for a dominant morphism of schemes.","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

2473024,(Proof verification) $f_n \to f$ and $g_n \to g$ both in measure with $\mu(X) < \infty$. Proving $f_n g_n \to fg$ in measure,"I am aware there are other proofs to this problem on this website but I was hoping to have my proof checked. Finiteness of the measure implies that we can choose $M$ large enough such that we can control measure ie for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $M$ large enough $\mu (\{x \in x : |f(x)| > M \}) < \epsilon.$ Similar holds if we replace $g$ for $f$. We know: $|f_n g_n - fg| = |f_n g_n - f_n g + f_n g - fg| \leq |f_n||g_n - g| + |g||f_n - f|$ Also note that $|f_n| \leq |f| + |f_n -f|$. With these details in mind: $\{x \in X : |f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon \} \subset \{x \in X : |f_n||g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2} \} \cup \{x \in X : |g||f_n - f| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2}\}$ Now, $\{x \in X : |f_n||g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2} \} \subset \{x \in X : |f_n| > M \} \cup \{x \in X : |g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}$ Using what was noted in the set-up $\{x \in X : |f_n| > M \} \cup \{x \in X : |g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}\subset \{x \in X : |f| > \dfrac{M}{2} \} \cup \{x \in X : |f_n - f| > \dfrac{M}{2} \} \cup \{x \in X : |g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}$ Similarly, $\{x \in X : |g||f_n - f| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2} \} \subset \{x \in X : |g| > M \} \cup \{x \in X : |f_n - f| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}$ For simplicity, let us name the sets: $$A:= \{x \in X : |f| > \dfrac{M}{2} \} $$
$$B:= \{x \in X : |f_n - f| > \dfrac{M}{2} \}$$
$$C:= \{x \in X : |g_n - g| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}$$
$$D:= \{x \in X : |g| > M \}$$
$$E:= \{x \in X : |f_n - f| > \dfrac{\epsilon}{2M} \}$$ Thus, $$\mu ( \{x \in X : |f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon \} ) \leq \mu (A) + \mu (B) + \mu (C)+ \mu (D) + \mu (E)$$ The finiteness of measure and the fact that $f$ and $g$ are real valued allows us to choose $M$ large enough such that $\mu(A) \leq \epsilon$ and $\mu(D) \leq \epsilon$. With this $M$ fixed, using the fact that $f_n$ and $g_n$ converge in measure, we can choose $n$ large enough such that $\mu(B) \leq \epsilon_1$, $\mu(C) \leq \epsilon_2$ and $\mu(E) \leq \epsilon_3$ , where $\epsilon_i$ can be chosen arbitrarily small. Thus: $$\mu ( \{x \in X : |f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon \} ) \leq 2\epsilon + \epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 + \epsilon_3 = \epsilon^{*}$$ Thus $f_n g_n \to fg$ in measure.","['real-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'analysis']"

2473558,Van Kampen and the 2-holed torus,"I guess this question is more related to my understanding of the amalgamated product of free groups than to the underlying topology. The goal is to compute the fundamental group of the 2-holed torus (i.e. the connected sum of 2 tori, $T^2 \# T^2$). I want to apply Van Kampen's theorem, and my decomposition is the following : take $U_1$ to be the first torus plus some overlap on the second one, $U_2$ to be the second torus plus some overlap on the first one, and $U_0 = U_1 \cap U_2$ to be the ""tube"" joining the two. Unless I am mistaken, we have that : $U_1$ and $U_2$ are homotopy equivalent to $T^2$ minus a point, and thus $\pi_1(U_1)=\pi_1(U_2)= \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}=F(\left\{a,b\right\})$, the free group on 2 generators. $U_0$ retracts to a circle, and $\pi_1(U_0)=\mathbb{Z}$. Thus by Van Kampen,
$$
\pi_1(T^2 \vee T^2)= F(\left\{a,b\right\}) *_{\mathbb{Z}}F(\left\{a,b\right\})
$$
where $*_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the free product with amalgation of $\pi_1(U_0)=\mathbb{Z}$. But this is as far as I can go in my description of this fundamental group. In a more general setting the free product with amalgation of $\pi_1(U_0)$ makes sense to me : it is simply the free product of the groups $\pi_1(U_1)$ and $\pi_1(U_2)$ with the added property that we can concatenate elements if they belong in the intersection. However in this very practical case I am unable to give any information on this product. This question , for example, gives the Cayley graph of the fundamental group.

This is a special case of a more general identity, $$ \binom{n+1}{r+s+1}=\sum_{a+b=n}\binom{a}{r}\binom{b}{s}, \tag{3} $$ where $\binom{a}{r}\binom{b}{s}$ counts the subsets of $\{1,\cdots,n+1\}$ where the element which separates $r$ terms on the left and $s$ terms on the right within the subset happens to separate $a$ terms on the left and $b$ terms on the right in the whole set (where we interpret left/right relative to the usual linear ordering of the numbers $1,\cdots,n+1$).

2474193,Importance of integral extension,"I am studying basic algebraic number theory these days and I am curious if the concept of “integral extension” is important in purely number theoretic sense. Of course, integral extension is a central object in commutative algebra so we can deduce lots of properties from this concept. However, as many number theory texts emphasize, commutative algebra originates from algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. I am curious about the motivation of integral extensions. In number theory, one extends $\mathbb{Z}$ to some larger ring $O$ to tackle problems on $\mathbb{Z}$. Indeed, this point of view greatly motivates the development of algebraic number theory as Kummer used $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$ to prove Fermat’s last theorem for regular primes. ($\zeta_n$ is an $n$-th primitive root of unity) Let $K$ be a number field. Then, is $O_K$ important in purely number-theoretic sense? I think knowing that “$\mathbb{Z}[S]$ is a Dedekind domain and ramification theory works for the extension $\mathbb{Z}[S]/\mathbb{Z}$” should be a main focus in algebraic number theory, so if not many such rings were $O_K$ then the theory of integral extension would be a bit useless in number theory. For example, if $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$ were not $O_K$ where $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ ($\zeta_n: n$-th primitive root of unity) and $\mathbb{Z}[w]$ were not $O_K$ where $K=\mathbb{Q}(w)$ ($w$: quadratic integer) then would the concept integral extension still be important in number theory? I don’t get any number-theoretic importance of the definition of integral closure itself. Let $K$ be a number field. Then, what does the collection of solutions of monic integral polynomials in $K$ have to do with number theory? Thank you in advance!","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'motivation']"

I'm inclined to say the relation is reflexive. By letting $x=5$, we can see that $x + x = 10$ is true. I'm choosing to let $x=5$ because, by definition of reflexivity, $\forall x\in A,\ xRx$. By definition, $x$ must equal $x$ and the only number that could make this relation true is 5. However, I came across this answer:
Consider the relation, $A =\{(x, y) \in \Bbb{Z} \times \Bbb{Z}: x + y = 10\}$ Let $(x ,y)= (3, 7)$. It follows that $3 + 7= 10$. Therefore, $(3, 7) \in A$.

I have solved the equations, but I can't quite get why would a resident on this hyperbolic space would view this vector field as a field of parallel vectors while he/she is moving along $γ(t)$. In other words, why would the resident actually see these vectors as being parallel to each other? EDIT: Also, parallel transport along a circle of constant latitude on a sphere looks like this (taken from T. Shifrin's excellent notes on differential geometry): While I can mathematically understand the explanation that Shifrin gives(the vector rotates to compensate for the covariant derivative that points along one of the poles in order to stay parallel), I again can't quite get or visualize why this is what a ""citizen"" on a sphere(we!) would consider as a parallel vector field.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

2475265,Map on étale cohomology in terms of torsors,"Let $X$ be the variety $\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}$, and consider the map $f:X\to X$, $z\mapsto z^2$. I am trying to compute the induced map $f^*$ on the first étale cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in a finite abelian group. The answer I find is incorrect, and I wish to ask for help finding the error. Let $n$ be an odd positive integer. Then $H^1_{et}(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$ classifies $\mathbb{Z}/n$-torsors over $X$. Let $\zeta_n=e^{2\pi i/n}$, and consider the torsor $T=\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}$, with projection map $\pi:T\to X$ given by $\pi(z)= z^n$ and the generator of $\mathbb{Z}/n$ acting on $T$ by $z\mapsto\zeta_n z$. The pullback torsor $f^*T$ is the fiber product of $X$ and $T$ over $X$, with respect to the maps $f$ and $\pi$. I claim this fibre product is again $f^*T=\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}$, with maps to $X$ and $T$ given by $z\mapsto z^n$ and $z\mapsto z^2$, respectively. The map $f^*T\to T$ should intertwine the action of the generator of $\mathbb{Z}/n$ on $f^*T$ and $T$, so the action on $f^*T$ must be $z\mapsto \zeta_n^{(n+1)/2}z$. Since $\zeta_n^{(n+1)/2}$ is the unique square root of $\zeta_n$ in the group of $n$-th roots of unity, I conclude that $f^*$ acts by multiplication by $1/2$ on $H^1_{et}(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$. However, I know from topology that $f^*$ acts by multiplication by $2$ on the singular cohomology $H^1(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$, and singular and étale cohomologies are supposed to agree over $\mathbb{C}$. What is wrong with my computation of $f^*$ on $H^1_{et}(X,\mathbb{Z}/n)$?","['algebraic-topology', 'etale-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2475375,Volume of a manifold,"Throughout this post, I am presuming $M$ to be an $2$-dimensional manifold that is parametrized by one chart $\varphi$, and I presume $\omega$ be a $2$-form on $M$. Apparently, there is no natural way to define the volume of a manifold, if it's not a pseudo-Riemannian manifold - i.e., we don't have a metric on it of some kind. Here is a question I have, based on that: 1 My ""argument"" against this a few days ago was this - why does it not make sense to define the volume as $
\int_M 1 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$? To this I got the reply, that I can ""scale"" that form, and it still makes perfect sense to define that as volume - so it's arbitrary to choose $1 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$ as opposed to $2 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$. I didn't undestand this argument, but I think I do now, and I'd like to make sure I undestand it correctly. I think the issue here stems from my previous understanding of $dx_i$ primarily as symbols, as opposed to actual linear maps from the tangent space, that are induced by some map. I thought $1 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$ is the always the same thing as $1 dy_1 \wedge .. \wedge dy_n$, that it's just a different notation of the coordinates - but I see now, that in some sense, that's not the case. - As a linear map from the tangent space, the expression $1 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$ by itself doesn't really make sense on it's own, and it's not something I can integrate on $M$ - first, I need to pick a certain chart, to know what $dx_i$ actually are - and this is arbitrary. More formally: If for a chart $\varphi$ I denote the 'induced' forms $dx_i$ as those forms, for which $dx_i(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i})=1$, where $(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i})$ is the tangent vector induced by $\varphi$. I take a ""scaled"" version of $\varphi$ and call this new chart $\varphi'$. If I now consider two differential forms : $\omega = 1 dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$ (where $dx_i$ are induced by $\varphi$) $\omega'= 1 dx_1' \wedge .. \wedge dx_n'$ (where $dx_i'$ are induced by $\varphi'$), it's actually true that $\omega' = \alpha dx_1 \wedge .. \wedge dx_n$ , for some $\alpha$. Thus, their integrals will give something different, depending on αα, and choosing one as opposed to the other is arbitrary, and so it doesn't make sense to prefer one as opposed to the other for defining volume. - Is my answer to 1 correct? 2 Based on all of this, does it then make sense to think of differential forms as some type of ""measure"", that gives me volumes of tangent vectors, parallelograms formed by a choice of two tangent vectors, or generalizations of the previous?","['manifolds', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds-with-boundary']"
2475384,"Why is binary compositum $T \circ R$ defined as $\{ (x,y); \; (\exists u)(xRu \wedge uTy) \}$?","In Elementary Set Theory, a profound understanding of compositums and how they are constructed is essential for further algebraic analisys (for rings, grupoids, groups etc.). In my textbook, the definition of the compositum of certain relations $T$ and $R$ is written as such: $$T \circ R := \{ (x,y); \; (\exists u)(xRu \wedge uTy) \}.$$ This seems counter-intuitive to me. If anythingl I always (apparently wrongly) considered $$T \circ R = \{ (x,y); \; (\exists u)(xTu \wedge uRy) \}$$ to be the right way to go about it. It is apparent that I am missing an essential idea behind the ""switched order"" of $T$ and $R$ in the definition of a compositum. To me, the example I gave would suffice on the surface, as all we need for a compositum is a ""bridge"" $u$ between elements $x$ and $y$. However, my presumption is clearly false, as compositum isn't a commutative relation. Write $$T \circ R = \{ (x,y); \; (\exists u)(xRu \wedge uTy) \}$$ $$R \circ T = \{ (x,y); \; (\exists u)(xTu \wedge uRy) \}$$ therefore $$T \circ R \neq R \circ T.$$ The author reaffirms this definition with an example: $$R = \{ (1,3), (2,3) \} \quad \text{and} \quad T = \{ (3,1) \}.$$ By definition, we get $$T \circ R = \{ (1,1), (2,1) \} \quad \text{and} \quad R \circ T = \{ (3,3) \}.$$ I would really appreciate if someone gave me an introspect into the underlying logic behind this definition.",['elementary-set-theory']
