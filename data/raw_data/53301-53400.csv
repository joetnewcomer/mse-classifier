564581,Möbius function of consecutive numbers,"This question arose from a problem in Niven & Zuckerman's book ""Introduction to the Theory of Numbers"". In the chapter that the authors introduce the Möbius function, the first exercise is the following: Find a positive integer $n$ such that $\mu(n)+\mu(n+1)+\mu(n+2)=3$, i.e, $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=1$. A brute-force approach reveals the solution $n=33$. My question is simply: Are there infinitely many $n$ in the previous conditions? I really don't know how to approach this problem. I tried various things (factorials, Chinese remainder theorem, etc.) and i didn't come up with nothing. Also, for the first thousand numbers, there are the solutions $n=33,85,93,141,201,213,217,301,393,445,633,697,869,921$. One can also think in the variation of the problem with $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=-1$. Thanks in advance!",['number-theory']

564673,Reflexive sheaves and determinants,"Let $X$ be a complex manifold. I just recall some notions, for my question below to be clear. Let $F\in\textrm{Coh}(X)$ be coherent of rank $r$. If it is torsionfree, it has a well-defined determinant line bundle $\det F=(\Lambda^rF)^{\vee\vee}\in\textrm{Pic}(X)$. If $r=1$, then $\det F=F^{\vee\vee}$. Furthermore, $F$ is torsionfree iff the natural map $F\to F^{\vee\vee}$ is injective, and is said to be reflexive iff that map is an isomorphism. It follows: Fact . A reflexive rank one sheaf $F$ on $X$, such that $\det F=\mathcal O_X$, is necessarily $\mathcal O_X$ itself. Let $I\subset \mathcal O_X$ be an ideal sheaf. Then $I$ is torsionfree of rank one, so it embeds into its double dual $0\to I\to I^{\vee\vee}=\det I$. Question : why is $I^{\vee\vee}=\mathcal O_X$? I believe I should use the Fact , but I do not see why $I^{\vee\vee}$ should be reflexive with trivial determinant. It is obviously reflexive because it is a line bundle, and it actually is its own determinant, but why is it trivial? Thanks for any help.","['algebraic-geometry', 'coherent-sheaves']"

564718,Why do we want probabilities to be *countably* additive?,"In probability theory, it is (as far as I am aware) universal to equate ""probability"" with a probabilistic measure in the sense of measure theory (possibly a particularly well behaved measure, but never mind). In particular, we do assume $\sigma$-additivity, but not anything more (say, additivity with respect to families with cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$ [which would of course make things break down]). For me, as a mathematician, this is completely satisfactory, and until recently I hardly realised that it may not be entirely obvious that probability should behave thus. A sufficiently convincing justification  for working with measures would be that integration theory is precious, and we want to be able to make use of integrals to compute expected values, variances, moments and so on. And we can't require any ""stronger"" kind of additivity, since then things fall apart already for a uniform random distribution on $[0,1]$. However, recently I have had some interactions with non-mathematicians, who approach ""higher"" mathematics with some understandable uncertainty, but who still find the notion of probability relevant. One of the things it made me realise is that I am not myself fully aware why, in principle, we define things thus and not otherwise. Hence, after this overlong introduction, here is the question. Is there a fundamental reason why measure theory is the ""only right way"" to deal with probabilities (as opposed to e.g. declaring probabilities to be just finitely additive)? If so, is there a ""spectacular"" example showing why any other approach would not work? If not, then is there an alternative approach (with any research behind it)?","['motivation', 'education', 'probability-theory', 'soft-question', 'probability']"

The catch is that the identity of $G$ may not be the identity function, i.e. identity of $Sym(X)$. One such example is as follows: Let $H$ be a group with identity element $e$. Take $X = H \times H$ and $G = \{(x, y) \mapsto (ax, e) : a \in H\}$ with the map $(x, y) \mapsto (x, e)$ as the identity of $G$. Clearly $G$ is a group.

564821,Find the Smith Normal Form of xI - A,"So for a homework in my Abstract Algebra class we are to find the invariant factors of a matrix using the Smith Normal Form. The matrix is rather large, so I was trying a 3x3 sub matrix first to just make sure I could get something simpler into SNF before embarking on the 7x7 case. So we have a matrix $$A =\pmatrix{1&1&0\\ 11&4&0\\0&0&0}$$ and I want to find the SNF of $$xI-A = \pmatrix{x-1&-1&0\\-11&x-4&0\\0&0&x}$$ Following something from Dummit & Foote I am just going to do elementary row and column operations to get down to a diagonal matrix whose entries divide each other (going left to right). Unfortunately when I went about this the matrix I ended up with was indeed diagonal but I did not get the dividing condition. So my question is if there is a specific sequence of operations which will get me to SNF (i.e. not every reduction will result in SNF) or if I somehow made a mistake. Here are the operations I did $$\pmatrix{x-1&-1&0\\-11&x-4&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{x-2&-1&0\\x-15&x-4&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{13&3-x&0\\x-15&x-4&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{1&\frac{3-x}{13}&0\\x-15&x-4&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\x-15&\frac{x^2-5x-7}{13}&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&\frac{x^2-5x-7}{13}&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&x^2-5x-7&0\\0&0&x}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&x&0\\0&0&x^2-5x-7}$$ Without using TikZ I wasn't sure how to put the column operations above the arrows so my operations are: $$C_1+C_2\mapsto C_1; R_1-R_2\mapsto R_1; \frac{1}{13}R_1\mapsto R_1; \frac{1}{13}(x-3)C_1 + C_2\mapsto C_2; (15-x)R_1 +R_2 \mapsto R_2; 13R_2\mapsto R_2$$ Then my last operation just moves the diagonal terms. So as can be seen I certainly get a diagonal matrix but $x\nmid x^2-5x-7$. So is it the case that there is a very specific way to get it to the correct form and other ways will fail? Because as it was explained in class it seemed that you could just go about it any way that makes the pivot column and row zero first. Any help is appreciated. EDIT:Will also answered below, so I'll give him the 'correct' answer but I also figured out the answer to my own question via a similar, but different set of steps. From where I left of I will get $$\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&x&x^2-5x-7\\0&0&x^2-5x-7}=\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&x&x(x-5)-7\\0&0&x^2-5x-7}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&x&-7\\0&0&x^2-5x-7}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&-7&x\\0&x^2-5x-7&0}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&-7&0\\0&x^2-5x-7&\frac{1}{7}x(x^2-5x-7)}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&x^2-5x-7&\frac{1}{7}x(x^2-5x-7)}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{7}x(x^2-5x-7)}\to\pmatrix{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&x(x^2-5x-7)}$$ Which is now in Smith Normal Form, but again Will's answer above is just as good.","['matrices', 'smith-normal-form', 'abstract-algebra']"

564874,Empirical Distribution Function Understanding,"I'm studying this topic by myself and I'm pretty sure there will be some big misunderstanding on my part, so please be patient with me. Given the sample $X_1,\ldots, X_n$, iid with distribution $F$, the Empirical (Cumulative) Distribution Function (EDF) is the random probability measure $F_N:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow [0,1]$, such that
$$F_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NI(X_i \leq x)$$ where $I$ is the indicator function. My problems are about the definition itself. Besides the explanations, examples are also welcome. I just want to get a good understanding about what is going on. Here go my doubts: 1) $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NI(X_i \leq x)$ is a sum of functions, not a real value in $[0,1]$, should it be $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NI(X_i \leq x)(x)$ or something else ? How should I interpret and calculate $I(X_i \leq x)$ ? 2) What is exactly a sample? At this time, I think it is a vector $(X_1(\omega),\ldots,X_N(\omega))$, where $\omega$ is some fixed event (that for some reason no one ever mention) and the $X_i$ are random ""random variables"" from the set of random variables with distribution $F$. Could one give a formal definition of sample? 3) In my understanding, $X_i\leq x=\{\omega\in\Omega: \ X_i(\omega)\leq x\}$, it is necessary to evaluate $X_i(\omega)$ for some $\omega$ to calculates $I(X_i\leq x)$. I already see the definition $I(X_i\leq x)=1 \textrm{ if }X_i\leq x \textrm{, or }0\textrm{ otherwise}$, how am I suposed to know if $X_i\leq x$ without some $\omega\in\Omega$? And why the set of events is never mentioned? 4) $F_N$ is called a distribution but they say it is a probability measure, also I already read it is a random variable. After all, what is it? 5) If $F_N$ is a probability measure, the function should be $F_N:\Sigma\rightarrow[0,1]$, where $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma-$ algebra over $\mathbb{R}$, but that is not the case, how to explain that?

564907,Help understanding solution to growth of partition function,"I'm currently a Combinatorics student trying to parse through this solution. I do not understand the proof currently. Any help understanding it is greatly appreciated. Question Let the number of partitions be given by the function $p(n)$, i.e. the number of ways of writing the integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers. Prove that that if $g$ is any polynomial function in $n$, then there exists an integer $N$ such that $g(n)<p(n)$ for all $n>N$. Do not use the asymptotic Hardy-Ramanujan formula. Provided Proof . Enough to show $n^a<p(n)$ for fixed positive integer $a$. (This is just saying that we want to show $p(n)$ grows faster than any degree polynomial of $n$, right?) We have that $(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_{a+1},1^{n-i_1-\cdots -i_{a+1}})$ is a partition of $n$ as long as $i_{a+1}\leq i_a\leq \cdots i_1 \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor$. ( I really don't understand this step. What is this partition? Of the coefficients or terms of polynomial $p(n)$? And how do we know this is $\leq \lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor$? ) The number of partitions $n$ of this form is multiset binomial coefficient
$$\left(\dbinom{\lfloor \frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor}{a+1}\right)=\frac{\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor(\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor+1)\cdots(\lfloor\frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor+a-1)}{(a+1)!}$$ (I'm assuming that if I can understand (2.) then I can understand this line) This means $p(n)>\left(\binom{\lfloor \frac{n}{a+1}\rfloor}{a+1}\right)$ for all $n>0$. Since $a$ is constant, the given fraction grows with order $n^{a+1}$, which means $p(n)>n^a$ for $n$ sufficiently large. (Why does it grow with order $n^{a+1}$?)

Then by instantaneous velocity we mean that the object at some instant is changing its position with respect to time, but may change to a velocity much faster. But if it is changing its position with that rate then the time passes by and that instant as well and at another instant the velocity is different. Did it even move with that velocity for a moment?

The composition of linear maps is linear, so we can choose the two rectangles to have two edges coinciding with the real and imaginary axes, and their common vertex at the origin. So as a portion of the real line gets mapped to itself, we can take $f$ to be the analytic continuation of a real function. Then I'm stuck. This question is confusing me. It's well known from the Riemann mapping theorem that there exists many holomorphic functions taking any rectangle to any other given rectangle.

565332,placing coins on a table with a twist.,"consider the classical puzzle, on a circular table, you and a friend take turns placing coins on the table and the first person who cannot do this loses. You can guarantee winning by placing the first coin in the centre and then maintain symmetry. Notice this strategy is independent of the table size. (i.e. the radius of the circle) So I asked myself the question: Does there exists a table shape such that the 2nd player has a winning strategy provided the table is large enough? The answer is yes, and an annulus is an example. My new question is does there exists a shape, topologically the same as a disc, for which, provided the table is large enough, the 2nd player is always guaranteed to win? (Consider two circles connected by a really thin rod, so thin that you cannot place a coin on the rod. In this case there is a strategy for the 2nd player to win by maintaining symmetry. However, if you enlarge the table proportionally, the thin rod will becomes thick enough for the first player to be able to place a coin at the middle of the thin rod, and maintain symmetry afterward, thereby guaranteeing a win. I wonder if there exists a shape, with no holes, for which the second player is guaranteed to win, for all 'sufficiently large' tables.)","['geometry', 'puzzle']"
565335,Is $\tan\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta$ an identity?,"A friend of mine, who is a high school teacher, called me today and asked the question above in the title. In an abstract setting, this boils down to asking whether an expression like ""$f=g$"" is regarded as an ""identity"" when one of their domains is a proper subset of the other, and the two functions coincide on the smaller domain. Examples of such equalities are abundant in high school mathematics exercises, e.g. $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=x+1,\ e^{\log x}=x$ etc.. Often, the domains are not specified in the exercises. A somewhat similar but subtly different case is when both functions are defined on the same domain but whether they are equal depends on the exact domain. For instance, $e^{x+y}\equiv e^xe^y$ for real or complex numbers but not for quaternions. Yet, for the purpose of discussion, let us focus on the aforementioned case of $f$ and $g$.

Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Let $a, b \in N$ with $N$ being the set of non-units in $R$. We must show the following to prove $N$ is an ideal - $0 \in N$ $a + b \in N$ $-a \in N$ $ar, ra \in N \ \forall r \in R$ 1. $0 \in N$ I.e. $0$ a non-unit. This is true as $\nexists \ 0^{-1}$ such that $0 \cdot 0^{-1} = 1$ 2. $a + b \in N$ Assume $a + b$ is a unit. Then $\exists \ g \in R$, $g \neq 0$ such that $(a + b)g = 1$ $\implies$ $ag + bg = 1$ For this to be true either $a$ or $b$ must be $0$. Consider the case when $a = 0$. Then we have $bg = 1$. But this is a contradiction as $b$ is a non-unit. Hence $\nexists \ g \in R$ such that $(a + b)g = 1$. Similarly for when $b = 0$. Therefore, $a + b$ is a non-unit. 3. $-a \in N$ I.e. Does there exist $(-a) \in N$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$? Assume $-a$ is a unit. Then $\exists \ g \in R, g \neq$ 0, such that $(-a)g = 1$ Consider $a + (-a) = 0$ Multiplying both sides by $g$ we get $(a + (-a))g = 0 \cdot g$ $ag + (-a)g = 0$ $ag + 1 = 0$ $-ag = 1$ $a(-g) = 1$ But this is a contradiction as $a$ is a non-unit. Hence $(-a)$ is a non-unit. 4. $ar, ra \in N \ \forall r \in R$ Assume $ar$ is a unit. Then $\exists \ g \in R, g \neq$ 0, such that $(ar)g = 1$ I.e. $a(gr) = 1$ But this is a contradiction as $a$ is a non-unit. Hence $ar$ is a non-unit.

A_Kf(x) = \int_M K(x,y) f(y) \,d\mu(y)

565507,Minimizing perimeter given rectangle's area for 10-years-olds,"I was recently in touch with some person from Russia how is busy with books for Russian elementary schools, in particularly I learned that now they give elementary set theory for the 2nd grade (8-years-olds) together with multiplications of natural numbers (I was happy to know that students are given something abstract at such age, but must admit they won't use it until they enter the university). My question elementary geometry rather than set theory, though. In a presentation for a book for the 4th grade (10-years-old) the following problem was described. A rectangular garden has an area of 900 sq.m, and you want to to a fence around it. What is the minimal length of the fence you need? So, given a rectangle with an area of 900 sq.m. students are asked to find the minimal possible value of a perimeter of such a rectangle. Regarding their geometrical knowledge: they studied how to find the area of a rectangle given lengths of its sides, and perhaps they also know the area formula for right triangles. Regarding their arithmetics, they know addition, multiplication, division with remainders - they don't know fractions for example. The way I'd solve the problem is to find the minimum of $x + 900/x$ which is far far beyond what these students can do. Even an expression by itself would be unknown for them, they only start solving ""equations"" of the form $3x=6$. I thus wonder, what could be the way students are assumed to solve this problem. Currently, I think of two possible ""solutions"". First, students can start choosing different pairs of sides: $(2,450)$, $(3,300)$ etc. until the moment they notice that passing by $(30,30)$ starts increasing the perimeter, and ""guess"" the right answer. This is not much of a solution, though, as students cannot justify why that $(30,30)$ is indeed the right answer. Second, students could have been told explicitly that among all rectangles with the same area, the square has the minimal perimeter. My question is: are there any elementary solutions for this problem that could be found by an extremely smart student, but without assuming any additional knowledge to what I've described?","['geometry', 'education', 'area', 'maxima-minima', 'recreational-mathematics']"

By definition of inverse $(x,x)\in R^{-1}$; therefore, $R^{-1}$ is reflexive. (b) If $R$ is transitive, then $R^{-1}$ is transitive. Let $x,y,z \in A$ be such that $x R^{-1} y$ and $y R^{-1} z$. Then by definition of the inverse, $y R x$ and $z R y$. By the transitivity of R we then know that $z R x$. Applying the definition of the inverse again gives that $x R^{-1} z$, and therefore $R^{-1}$ is transitive. (c) If $R$ is symmetric, then $R^{-1}$ is symmetric. Let $x,y,z \in A$ be such that $x R^{-1} y$; then by definition of the inverse, $y R x$. $R$ is symmetric, so we know that $x R y$. By definition of the inverse again, we have $y R^{-1} x$ and therefore that $R^{-1}$ is symmetric. (d) If $R$ is antisymmetric, then $R^{-1}$ is antisymmetric. Don't know about (d). What about: Let $a,b \in A$ be such that $aR^{-1}b$ and $bR^{-1}a$. Then by definition of the inverse $bRa$ and $aRb$. But $R$ is antisymmetric, so $a = b$.

where $\nabla_\gamma$ is the covariant derivative. The author didn't write what does mean $\nabla^\gamma$. I've found in the internet that the notation $\nabla^\gamma$ is sometimes used for the so-called contravariant derivative that is given by $\nabla^\gamma = g^{\gamma i} \nabla_i$, where $g_{ij}$ is a metric tensor. If we use this definition then for a smooth function $f$ on a manifold we will have:
$$
   \Delta f = - g^{\gamma i} \nabla_i \nabla_\gamma f = g^{\gamma i}\nabla_i \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^\gamma}\right) = g^{\gamma i} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \partial x^\gamma},

but this formula doesn't coincide with the formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

565823,plane of symmetrie leads to geodesic,"Any plane of symmetry intersects a surface in a geodesic. I am having a little difficulty with the proof of this one.

It is orthogonal to the tangent vector of the curve of intersection and so $\vec T'$ points normally. What I don't understand is the conclusion that $T'$ points normally. I know that we can write $k\vec N=\vec T'=k_n \vec n+k_g \vec n\times\vec T$. We already know that $\vec n$ lies in the plane of symmetry and, as I understand it, $\vec T$ has to lie in the plane, too.

565919,Strange mistake in this proof about normed separable vector spaces.,"I am supposed to prove that an infinite-dimensionale separable normed space $X$ constains a countable subset $Y$ that is linearly independent and dense. There are three hints given: 
First, prove that no subspace of X contains an open ball.
Second, prove that $\overline{\{x_n;n \in \mathbb{N}\}} = X$ and $||x_n-y_n|| \le \frac{1}{n}$ for all n and therefore $\overline{\{y_n;n \in \mathbb{N} \} }=X$. Finally, construct the set inductively. My proof of the first hint: Assuming false, then some $B_{\epsilon}(x)\subset X' \subsetneq X$, where X' and X are both vector spaces. But in that case there is some vector $w \in X \backslash X'$ and therefore we have that $x + \frac{\epsilon}{2 |w|}w \in B_{\epsilon}(x)$, but since $x \in X'$ it would follow that since $B_{\epsilon}(x)\subset X'$ we have $w \in X'$ which is wrong. My second proof is: Assuming false, then $\exists x \in X \exists m \in \mathbb{N} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}: d(x,y_n) \ge \frac{1}{m} $ Since the $x_n$ are dense we can say that there are at least infinitely many $x_n$ such that $d(x_n,x)\le \frac{1}{2m}$.
So we get that: $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: d(x,x_n)+ d(x_n,y_n) \ge d(x,y_n) \ge \frac{1}{m}$, but this can't be true, since we know that for infinitely many $d(x,x_n)$ is small and for $n > m+1$ we have that $d(x_n,y_n) \leq \frac{1}{m+1}$. So contradiction. Now I wanted to construct the countable dense and linear independent set in the following way:
Step 1 :  $ y_1:=x_1$ and therefore $Y=\{x_1\}$. This is of course linearly independent and we have $|x_1-y_1|=0$. Step n to n+1: $Y=\{y_1,...,y_n\}$ be constructed.
Now if $x_{n+1} \in span(Y)$ then we choose some vector in $X$ that is not in $span(Y)$ and say $y_{n+1} = x_{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2}\frac{w}{||w||}$. This is leaves Y linearly independet and $|y_{n+1}-x_{n+1}|\leq\frac{1}{n+1}$
If $x_{n+1} \not \in  span(Y)$, we set $y_{n+1} = x_{n+1}$. In that case Y is also linearly independent and $|y_{n+1}-x_{n+1}|=0\leq\frac{1}{n+1}$. In that case we get a set $Y$ that is linearly independent and countable and by the second hint that I proved it is also dense in $X$. But the problem is: I did not use hint 1, so my proof is probably wrong! So, where is my mistake?","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

one must find an expression for $K_N(x,y)$, and evaluate the limit
$$K(X,Y):=\lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{2^{1/2}N^{1/6}} K_N\left(\sqrt{2N}+\frac{X}{2^{1/2}N^{1/6}},\sqrt{2N}+\frac{Y}{2^{1/2}N^{1/6}}\right)$$
to prove that $$K(X,Y)=\frac{Ai(X)Ai'(Y) - Ai(Y)Ai'(X)}{X-Y}.$$ So far I can easily show that the norm of the $N-1$ polynomial is  $2^{-N-1}\Gamma(N)\sqrt{\pi}$ and thus that
  $$ K_N(x,y) = \frac{e^{-x^2/2}e^{-y^2/2}}{2^N\Gamma(N)\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{H_N(x)H_{N-1}(y)-H_{N-1}(X)H_N(Y)}{x-y}\right)$$
  which can then be related to the asymptotic extension. However I have no idea of how to relate $H_n$ and $H_{n-1}$ in a way that yields a derivative of the Airy function... even in the limiting case $N\to\infty$. Any hint appreciated.","['asymptotics', 'matrices', 'random-matrices', 'orthogonal-polynomials']"
565987,Probability problem - 3 hunters and a boar,"3 hunters fire simultaneously at a boar. One bullet hits the boar. What probability is for each hunter to be the one who hit the boar, when hunter A hits with accuracy of 0.2, B 0.4, C 0.6? I see 2 possible solutions: The first one is simple. When I take 10 average bullets of hunter A, I've got 2 bullets that hit, 4 for B and 6 for C. If I take all 30 imaginary bullets, I put the bullets that missed away and have 12 left. This leads me to $$\frac{2}{12},\frac{4}{12},\frac{6}{12}=\frac1{6}, \frac1{3}, \frac1{2}$$The second one is that for each hunter, I take probability of the fact that his bullets hit and the other hunters' did not and divide it by probability that this occured or one of the others got lucky. This is basically dividing the 'good' possibilities by all possibilities. I get the numerator for the first hunter by multiplying his accuracy (0.2) by inverses of accuracies of the other guys (0.6 and 0.4). The denominator is the same for all of them and contains the sum of nominators for each hunter. So for A, it is $$\frac{0.2\cdot0.6\cdot0.4}{0.2\cdot0.6\cdot0.4+0.4\cdot0.8\cdot0.4+0.6\cdot0.8\cdot0.6}$$The results are $\frac{48}{464},\frac{128}{464},\frac{288}{464}=\frac{3}{29},\frac{8}{29},\frac{18}{29}$ Now, which one of these methods is correct? And maybe even more importantly, why the other one isn't?","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

566015,"What is $\Delta\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}$, as a distribution?","$\newcommand{\x}{\mathbf{x}}$Let $\x$ denote a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $|\x|$ its magintude and $\Delta=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x 2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y 2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z 2}$ the usual Laplacian. What is
$$\Delta\frac{1}{|\x|^2}$$
in the sense of distribution? That is, what is
$$\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x$$
for any test function $\varphi\in C^{\infty}_c(\mathbb{R}^3)$ (the subscript $c$ means compact support). Attempt: I know how to do it for $\Delta\frac{1}{|\x|}$ (we get $\Delta\frac{1}{|\x|}=-4\pi\delta_0$, where $\delta_0$ is the delta distribution at $0$) and some others, and I am trying to reproduce the steps for this case but it does not seem to work. Let $\newcommand{\e}{\varepsilon}\e>0$ and consider the ball $B(0,\e)$ of radius $\e$ centered at $0$. Then, 
$$\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x= \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x+\iiint_{B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x$$
Then, we can see that
$$\left|\iiint_{B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x\right|\leq \iiint_{B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}|\Delta\varphi(\x)|d\x \leq C\int_0^\e\frac{1}{\rho^2}\rho^2 d\rho\to0$$
as $\e\to 0$. Now, since $\varphi$ has compact support, there is a compact subset $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ that includes $B(0,\e)$ such that $\varphi$ and all its derivatives vanish on $\Omega^c$. Thus,
$$\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x = \iiint_{\Omega\setminus B(0,\e)}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)d\x$$
Now by Green's Second Identity,
$$\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B(0,\e)}\left(\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)-\varphi(\x)\Delta\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\right)d\x = \iint_{\partial\Omega}\left(\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\frac{\partial\varphi(\x)}{\partial\mathbf{n}}-\varphi(\x)\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{n}}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\right)dS+ \iint_{\partial B(0,\e)}\left(\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\frac{\partial\varphi(\x)}{\partial\mathbf{n}}-\varphi(\x)\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{n}}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\right)dS$$
Since $\varphi$ and all its derivatives vanish on $\partial \Omega$, we are left with
$$\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B(0,\e)}\left(\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\Delta\varphi(\x)-\varphi(\x)\Delta\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\right)d\x= \iint_{\partial B(0,\e)}\left(\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\frac{\partial\varphi(\x)}{\partial\mathbf{n}}-\varphi(\x)\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{n}}\frac{1}{|\x|^2}\right)dS$$
