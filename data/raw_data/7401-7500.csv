56146,Solving 2nd order ODE with non-constant coefficient of form 1/x,"I have a differential equation of the form
$$a y'' + b y/x = E y$$
(The origin is a 1D Schrödinger equation for a potential of the form $-1/x$). I am only interested in the ground state energy, i.e. the lowest order solution. Is there a good, systematic way to tackle this? I used a lot of hand waving: I said that for $x \rightarrow \infty$, the potential term is negligible and the equation is a simple homogeneous 2nd order ODE with constant coefficients, which has solution $e^{-kx}$ for some $k$. So as an overall ansatz I choose 
$$f(x)e^{-kx}$$, which yields 
$$a (f'' - 2k f' + k^2 f) + b f/x = E f$$. I then argue -- that is where the hand-waving occurs -- that the ground state would have a polynomial of the lowest possible order for $f$. A constant (order $0$) is not possible, since then nothing cancels the $1/x$ in the equation, so I try the ansatz $f(x) = x$. With that, I can indeed solve the equation and obtain conditions for $k$ and $E$: $$-2ka + b = 0$$
$$ak^2 = E$$ This allows me to solve for $k$ and $E$. But is there a better, more rigorous way?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
56151,Finding the center of gravity of a homogeneous tetrahedron,"I am reading 'How to solve it' by George Polya and am stuck on a problem concerning finding the center of gravity of a homogeneous tetrahedron. The approach described by the author is to first solve for finding the center of gravity of a homogeneous triangle, then by analogy, use that to solve for the homogeneous tetrahedron. I understand the solution for the triangle, which is to find the intersection of all (3) of the triangle's medians. On the solution to the tetrahedron part, the author states: In the case of the tetrahedron we have six median planes like MCD, joining the midpoint of some edge to the opposite edge, each of which has to contain the center of gravity of the tetrahedron. Therefore, these six median planes must meet in one point which is precisely the center of gravity My problem is that I don't know how the author counted six median planes. In my opinion, the tetrahedron has 4 triangles (the faces) and each triangle has 3 medians, therefore the total median planes should be 12 and not 6. I think there is some overlap between the 12 median planes I counted hence there is some double counting. I tried to draw each median plane on paper but was unsuccessful as it got messy quickly. What is a systematic way to count and visualize the 6 median planes in a homogeneous tetrahedron?",['geometry']

56268,Algebraic Link/Knot not of the Torus Type,"I'm studying Milnor's Singularities of Complex Hypersurfaces , and a small, perhaps moot, point in Chapter 10 has me thinking in circles. (I asked a related but different question here ). Here is some relevant background material, most of which can be found in the book. Let $f \colon (\mathbb{C}^{n},\mathbf{0}) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$ be a complex analytic function with an isolated critical point at the origin. Define the singular hypersurface $V_{f, \kappa} = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for small $\kappa > 0$ . Milnor proves that the map $\varphi_{f} = f/\| f \| \colon S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1} \setminus V_{f, \kappa} \to S^{1}$ is a fibration, where $\epsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small. The intersection of $V_{\kappa}$ with a small sphere $S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1}$ is an algebraic link which we denote by $K_{f}$ . (It is known that all algebraic links are fibered links (by definition) as well as iterated torus links .) In 1928, Brauner proved that for $f = z_{1}^{p} + z_{2}^{q}$ , $K_{f}$ is a torus link $T_{p,q}$ , which is a knot if $p$ and $q$ are coprime. In 1968, Milnor conjectured that the unknotting number $u(T_{p,q})$ is equal to the delta invariant of the corresponding complex algebraic plane curve. By a theorem of Kronheimer and Mrowka in 1992, the conjecture is true. In the same book, Milnor proves the relation $\mu = 2 \delta - r + 1$ , where $\delta$ is the delta invariant, $r$ is the number analytically irreducible branches of $V_{f,0}$ passing through the origin and $\mu = \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}\{ z_1, \dots, z_n \} / \langle \partial_1 f, \dots, \partial_n f \rangle$ . Questions: Is there an algebraic link that is not of the torus-type $T_{p,q}$ ; one whose crossing number, unknotting number, etc. is well-known? For example, what is the link of $f = z_1^{a} z_2^{b} + z_1^{c} z_{2}^{d}$ , where not both $ac = 0$ and $bd = 0$ (provided that $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative integers such that $f$ has an isolated critical point at the origin)? Can the delta invariant be defined for any non-degenerate weighted homogeneous polynomial of two variables? If so, how does one compute it? My understanding is that the delta invariant can be defined if and only if the polynomial is square-free , which leads me to yet another question: What is a square-free complex polynomial? If so, how does one reconcile the fact that the corresponding unknotting number exists but the delta invariant may not be defined, if these are suppose to be equal? Edit : The question about square-free complex polynomials has been answered in the comments. Since the ring of convergent power series $\mathbb{C}\{ z_1, \dots, z_n \}$ is a UFD, then a series $f$ is square-free if and only if factored into irreducibles, $f = f_1^{r_1} \cdots f_{n}^{r_{n}}$ , it is the case $r_{i} = 1$ . Note, here $r = \sum_i r_i$ . This is true (though not too simple to prove) if and only if $\mu$ is non-negative and finite.

where, for fixed $Z \in \cal{S}$, $\mu|_Z (E)=\mu(E \cap Z)$ for every $E \in \cal{S}$. I think that if there exist a finite number of disjoint atoms, we can find decomposition in the following way.

56413,Two finite fields with the same number of elements are isomorphic,"Fraleigh(7ed) Theorem33.12. Let $p$ be a prime and let $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. If $E$ and $E'$ are fields of order $p^n$, then $E \simeq E'$. Proof in the text: Both $E$ and $E'$ have $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as prime field, up to isomorphism. By Corollary 33.6(A finite extension $E$ of a finite field $F$ is a simple extension of $F$), $E$ is a simple extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of degree $n$, so there exists an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ such that $E\simeq \mathbb{Z}_p[x]/ \langle f(x) \rangle$. Because the elements of $E$ are zeros of $x^{p^n}-x$, *we see that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^{p^n}-x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$* . Because $E'$ also consists of zeros of  $x^{p^n}-x$, we see that $E'$ also contains zeros of irreducible $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$. Thus, because $E'$ also contains exactly $p^n$ elements, $E'$ is also isomorphic to $E\simeq \mathbb{Z}_p[x]/\langle f(x) \rangle$. I don't know why $f(x)$ divides $x^{p^n}-x$. $E$ has a zero $\alpha$ of $f(x)$, but it doesn't need to have all the zeros of $f(x)$. So $f(x)=(x-\alpha)g(x)$ in $E[x]$ and $g(x)$ need not be splitted into linear factors. How can $f(x)$ divide $x^{p^n}-x$?","['finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

I was thinking of evaluating the integral around a semicircle with radius $R$ (taking $R$ to $\infty$), and a line segment on the bottom (i.e., the contour with the line segment from $-R$ to $R$, and the semicircle on top).  I was going to evaluate the integral of the function  $$ f(z) = \frac{e^{iz \alpha} }{(z^2+b^2)^2}$$ around this contour. However, since there is a singularity at $ib$ , a point contained within the contour, I had to use the residue theorem to calculate the integral around the entire region. I thought this would be an easy task, but it actually proved to be a hold up, as using the limit technique of evaluating poles of order 2 lead me to a limit which I could not figure out how to compute. To summarize my intent was to take the integral of $f(z)$ around the two pieces of the contour, show that the top part goes to 0, and then note that the integral around the bottom line segment is twice as much as the desired integral, since the function of the desired integral is even. Then we have that the desired integral is one-half of the residue value. However I got stuck on calculating the residue using the limit definition, and could not find a Laurent expansion of my function. Edit: Just to clarify, the contour I am describing can be parametrized as $$\phi_1(t) = t ,-R\leq t\leq R \text{ and }\phi_2(t) = Re^{it},  0\leq t\leq\pi.$$",['complex-analysis']

56555,"Need mathematical function for ""adding"" 0.5 and 0.5 and getting 0.4","I'm looking for a mathematical function that would have the following attributes: Reasonably smooth -- continuous to the second or third derivative, say, for values greater than zero. Given two values 1.0 and 1.0 it produces 1.0 Given two values less than 1.0 (but greater than 0), such as 0.5 and 0.5 it produces a number less than either number but greater than the product of the two numbers (eg, 0.4). Similarly, for two values greater than 1.0 it produces a number greater than either but less than their products (less important). ADDED: Given one value 1.0 and another not, should produce the second value -- f(1.0, N) = N. Ideally (not a hard requirement), the function is associative and commutative. Ideally (not a hard requirement), there is a ""knob"" one can turn to adjust the ""strength"" of the function, in terms of, eg, whether f(0.5,0.5) = 0.4 or instead 0.3. Eg, I could simply use multiplication, where 0.5 $\cdot$ 0.5 = 0.25, but that results in a number (to be used as a weighting factor) that is too small. After some experimentation (in a ""toy"" Java test program): Math.exp(-Math.pow(Math.pow(Math.abs(Math.log(A)), fudge) + Math.pow(Math.abs(Math.log(B)), fudge), 1.0/fudge)); $$f(A,B)=\exp(-((|\ln A|^{\text{fudge}}+|\ln B|^{\text{fudge}})^{(1/{\text{fudge})}}))$$ comes pretty close, where ""fudge"" is roughly 2.0, and the inputs are <= 1. However, it obviously doesn't work right for values of A and B > 1.0, and my crude attempts to extend it didn't produce a very smooth function.  [I found out later that the function was reasonably smooth, only Excel was plotting it strangely due to the way I generated the input file.] (exp, pow, abs, and log are all the mathematical functions you'd expect from their names.) So: Is there an obvious mathematical formula that provides the desired characteristics? Background: This function is used to combine ""adjustment factors"" used to correct for the interdependence of observations in a Bayesian inference.  In each step of the Bayesian calculations, a multiplier consisting of the conditional probability divided by the marginal probability is generated.  That multiplier is ""adjusted"" by raising it to the power of the combined (using the sought-after formula) ""adjustment factors"" reaching it from previous terms in the equation. (I'm not here to have this adjustment scheme critiqued or debated, I'm just giving this for background.) I plotted, in Excel, the results (for fudge = 2.0, alpha = 1.0) from Didier Piau's scheme, close as I could understand it.  (Sorry, Didier, if it's not correct.)  It came out looking the same as the kludge I had cooked up earlier, though that earlier version occupied about 3 times as much code. Since I don't understand Excel plotting very well the X axis is screwed up -- it represents B values times 10.  The Y axis is the function value.  (The curve fitting may be wrong in spots -- it's Excel's default.) It certainly looks a bit peculiar, but I can't see anything specific that's wrong with it. Musing: It kinda seems to me like there would be a name for this sort of function.  It's kind of a ""mean"", or maybe a ""product"".

I then take the average of the results. I want to find what this average approaches as the number of trials increases. Thus by trial and error I find that the definition of $E(X)$ works.

The other day, someone offered me the following heuristic argument for why, for large $n$ , this gap cannot be larger than $c/n^2$ for some constant $c>0$: This is the transition matrix of a Markov chain on $n$ nodes which, except at the  endpoints, moves left and right with equal probability. Its stationary distribution is uniform. Now the second eigenvalue measures the time until you get close to the stationary distribution, and observe that by the central limit theorem, as $n$ gets large, a particle which begins at the midpoint will take on the order of $n^2$ steps until it puts a constant probability on order of $n$ nodes. Consequently, the gap cannot be larger than on the order of $1/n^2$. Intuitively, this makes sense. I would like to ask: Question: Is there a way to make the above argument rigorous? One difficulty is that the smallest eigenvalue also affects mixing time, but we can perhaps get rid of this difficulty by taking a convex combination with the identity. A more serious problem seems to be the boundary effects, but perhaps one can argue that they ""go away"" as $n \rightarrow \infty$. I'm not sure how to argue any of this, and I'd be very interested in seeing a formalization of this argument.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'linear-algebra']"

56663,Is There a Natural Way to Extend Repeated Exponentiation Beyond Integers?,"This question has been in my mind since high school. We can get multiplication of natural numbers by repeated addition; equivalently, if we define $f$ recursively by $f(1)=m$ and $f(n+1)=f(n)+m$, then $f(n) = m \times n$.  Likewise, we get exponentiation by repeated multiplication. If $g(1)=m$ and $g(n+1)=mg(n)$, then $g(n) = m^n$.  In my high school mind it was natural to imagine a new function defined by repeated exponentiation: $h(1)=m$ and $h(n+1)=m^{h(n)}$. These definitions only make sense for $n$ a natural number, but of course there are standard very mathematically satisfying ways to define multiplication and exponentiation by any real number. My question is this: Can the function $h$ defined above also be extended in a natural way to $\mathbb{R}^{>0}$? The question is in the spirit of seeking an extension of $f(n)=n!$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and arriving at $\Gamma(x)$. Let me focus the question, and attempt to make precise what I mean by ""in a natural way."" Take $h(1)=2$ and $h(n+1)=2^{h(n)}$. $h$ is now defined on $\mathbb{N}$, and $h(2)=4$, $h(3)=16$, $h(4)=2^{16}=65,536$ etc. Is it possible to extend the domain of definition of $h$ to all positive reals in such a way that a) The functional equation $h(x+1)=2^{h(x)}$ continues to be satisfied for all $x$ in the domain. b) $h$ is $C^\infty$. (Analytic would be even better but this seems maybe too much to hope for?) c) All $h$'s derivatives are monotone. These requirements are my attempt to codify what would count as ""natural."" I am open to suggestions about what would be a better list of requirements. If such a function exists, I would like to know how to construct it; if it doesn't, I would like to know why (i.e. outline of proof), and if relaxing some of the requirements (e.g. just the first derivative monotone) would make it possible. (If the function exists, I am also interested in the questions, ""is it unique?"" ""Could we add some natural requirements to make it unique?"" But my main query is about existence.)","['functions', 'tetration', 'real-analysis']"

True or False:   let $A,B \in \mathbb{Q}^{n \times n }$  Suppose $xI-A$ and $xI-B$ are equivalent then $\det(xI-A) = \det(xI-B)$. I wrote in my notes this is true because any two matrices are equivalent in $\mathbb{Q[x]}^{n \times n}$ if and only if they have the same invariant factors.  Since the characteristic polynomial is a product of the invariant factors it follows that $\det(xI-A) = \det(xI-B)$. True or False:   let $A,B \in \mathbb{Q}^{n \times n }$. If $\det(xI-A) = \det(xI-B)$ (in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$) then $xI-A$ and $xI-B$ are equivalent  in $\mathbb{Q}[x]^{n \times n}$ I think this is false because of the fact that equality of determinants is not strong enough to guarantee all invariant factors are equal but I do not have an example.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'characteristic-polynomial']"
56675,Thoroughly understand the concepts and formulas in Linear Algebra [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What's an intuitive way to think about the determinant? (18 answers) Closed 9 years ago . In linear algebra(I'm the beginner so far), I feel the concepts and ideas are based on on another, like layer by layer , and there are many relations among the properties. For example, Matrix Multiplication, AB is essentially the composition of Linear Transformation（$A(Bx)=(AB)x$ to manually define AB) , and Linear Transformation is also from Matrix Equation($Ax=b, T(x)=b=Ax$)，and Matrix Equation is also from Vector Equation($x_1a_1+...+x_na_n=b$ equivalent to $Ax=b$)，and finally Vector Equation is the basic System of Linear Equations. so Vector Equation could be intuitively understood as Linear System，Matrix Equation is just another formation。 Linear Transformation is fine too，but when it comes to Matrix Algebra， like Inverse Matrix and its properties, it seems very hard to be intuitively understood through the basic System of Linear Equations. It'll be only fine when I admit the manually definition the matrix multiplication from composition of linear transformation. Because as the process moves on, it's more and more like everything is constructed layer by layer, and more and more complicated as it's very hard to try to understand it from the very basic layer (e.g. linear system) intuitively . I'm not sure whether it's the normal situation, because there are also intersected properties among many 'layers'. Therefore the whole 'knowledge structure' is not very clear in my brain. And, when I think of the the basic Quadratic Formula in elementary algebra, ， its meaning is just to solve the quadratic equation with one variable, and then it is proved from completing square of $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to find general formation of $x$. But it is still impossible to 'understand thoroughly' from the original equation like how the relation among each variable and coefficient. So when I need to use it, I just refer to the book or prove it myself (assume if I forget) So will it the same thing as learning the Linear Algebra, like the determinant of matrix,  $\det A = \sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{1+j}a_{1j}\det A_{1j}$. Is it okay that what I need to do is only to know two things, What it really is. How to prove it. (When I use it, just refer to book or prove it, however, prove the determinant takes a little long time). Because this formula ($\det A$) is already impossible to be thoroughly understood from the very basic 'layer' like system of linear equations or even vector equation. I only know, Firstly its meaning is to determine whether a matrix is invertible (because invertible matrix must has $n\times n$ size and has pivot position in each row and no zeros in diagonal entries.), Secondly it's proved from $n\times n$ matrix row reduced to echelon form, then the right-bottom corner must be nonzero, the above formula is just the brief formation of the item in right-bottom corner. I know this two things, could I say I'm already understand it ? Because even though I know 1.what is really is and 2.how to prove it , but I'm still not able to remember it when use it.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

I thought about the following steps, but my implementation did not seem to work: Find a vector normal to the cone axis vector (by crossing the cone axis vector with the cardinal axis that corresponds with the cone axis vector component nearest to zero, ex: $[1 0 0]$ for $[-1 5 -10]$) Find a second normal vector using a cross product Generate a random angle between $[-\pi, \pi]$ Rotate use the two normal vectors as a $2D$ coordinate system to create a new vector at the angle previously generated Generate a random displacement value between $[0, \tan(\theta)]$ and square root it (to normalize distribution like for points in a circle) Normalize the sum of the cone axis vector with the random normal vector times the displacement value to get the final direction vector [edit] After further thinking, I'm not sure that method would work with theta angles greater or equal to pi. Alternative methods are very much welcome.","['geometry', 'random']"
56785,Asymptotic behaviour of a two-dimensional recurrence relation,"This problem comes out of a research in models of firm growth. The model is simple: A firm has two parameters which are its size (number of employees) and job vacancies. A firm of size $n$ will produce job vacancies at rate $n\mu$ and $k$ job vacancies will be filled at rate $k\beta$. On the other hand, a firm is likely to quit at rate $\delta$, and new firms come into the market at rate $\alpha$ (new firm starts with 0 employee and 1 vacancy, but one can also model it as 1 employee and 0 vacancy if necessary). So in terms of math, the equation describing the relation is:
$D_t s_{n,k,t}=-(n\mu+k\beta+\delta)s_{n,k,t}+(k+1)\beta s_{n-1,k+1,t}+n\mu s_{n,k-1,t}$, when (n,k) is not in the boundary, where $s_{n,k,t}$ is the probability of a firm having size $n$ and $k$ vacancies. I am particularly interested in the stationary distribution which is described by: $s_{0,1}=\frac{\alpha}{\delta+\beta}$, $s_{n,k}=0$ for $n<0$ or $k<0$, and $(n\mu+k\beta+\delta)s_{n,k}=(k+1)\beta s_{n-1,k+1}+n\mu s_{n,k-1}$. Moreover, the generating function $M(x,y)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{s_{n,k}x^ny^k}}$ satisfies the PDE $\delta M=\beta(x-y)M_y+\mu x(y-1)M_x+\alpha y$. What I would like to know is the asymptotic behavior of $s_n=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{s_{n,k}}$, or more explicitly the tail $\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}{s_n}$ when m is very large. The empirical Data on firm size suggests that it might appear as a power law (~ $n^{-\zeta}$, where $\zeta$ is a bit larger than 1), also it may not have a finite variance ($M_{xx}(1,1)=\infty$). The one-dimensional problem, in which we only consider the size (that is, vacancies are filled immediately), is completely characterized by Yule process and also suggests the power law. Could anyone give me some insight on how to approach this problem? I've been considering this problem for a month, but since I am not familiar with highly technical tools in analysis or probability I get stuck completely.

56795,Proving the Maximum Modulus Principle using the Open Mapping Theorem,"I was reading on Wikipedia that ""The maximum modulus principle can be viewed as a special case of the open mapping theorem, which states that a nonconstant holomorphic function maps open sets to open sets. If $|f|$ attains a local maximum at $a$, then the image of a sufficiently small open neighborhood of $a$ cannot be open. Therefore, $f$ is constant"". Could someone expand upon that? I don't follow why the image of a open neighborhood of a would not be open?",['complex-analysis']
56815,How do I calculate the probability of getting 10 unique members of a set given random selection with replacement?,Assume I have a set of 20 numbers. Each number in the set is unique. I am able to retrieve one number at a time from the set with the probability of retrieving any one member of the set being equal. How would I go about determining the probability that after ten random retrievals with replacement (i.e. a retrieval does not remove a number from the set) I would have 10 unique members? Many thanks for your assistance.,['probability']
56816,Profinite topologies on a group,"Let $G$ be a finitely generated group. Suppose we have two families $F_1$ and $F_2$ of finite index subgroups of $G$, and each family has trivial intersection and is filtered from below (i.e. for any two elements in the family their intersection contains some third element). These families generate two profinite topologies on $G$. (Taking the subgroups in the families as basis of open neighborhoods around identity). Suppose the completions wrt to these families produce isomorphic profinite groups. Can we say that these families generate the same topology on $G$? (Equivalently, given any $N \in F_1$ is there $N_2 \in F_2$ such that $N_1 \leq N_2$ and vice versa.) What if one family is a subfamily of the other?",['group-theory']
56818,Help understand compact open topology,"May I refer you to: Lemma 4.1.6 in: http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/Math-Net/Lehrveranstaltungen/Lehrmaterial/SS2005/Liegruppen/skript/ch5vorl.pdf Page $4$ OK so I want to understand why that family forms a subbasis for the compact open topology. By definition of subbasis we must show that the each basic open set is a finite intersection of sets of elements of the form $[K,V]$ right? My question is, it seems that the author is just showing that each element of $[K,U]$ is a finite union of finite intersections of elements of the collection, why this implies that it is a subbasis? I'm really confused with the statement. Can you please explain what we really have to prove?",['general-topology']
56820,Determining the Jordan form of a matrix given the invariant factors,"I am trying to recover the Jordan normal form of a matrix given a list of invariant factors and was wondering if I am proceeding correctly in constructing the Jordan blocks. Let $F = \mathbb{C}$ and let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over $F$.  Let $T:V\to V$ be a linear operator and give $V$ the structure of a module over the polynomial ring $F[x]$ by defining $x \alpha = T(\alpha) \alpha \in V$ let
$$
A = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x^2(x-1)^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & x(x-1)(x-2)^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 &  x(x-2)^3 \end{array} \right)  
$$
be a relation matrix for V with respect to $\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$ generators of $V$. Then $d_1 = x$, $d_2 = x(x-1)(x-2)^2$ and $d_3 = x^2(x-1)^2(x-2)^3$ are the invariant factors of $T$. Then we know $ V = F[x] / (x) \oplus F[x]/ (x(x-1)(x-2)^2) \oplus F[x]/(x^2(x-1)^2(x-3)^3)$.  Further we know that the minimal polynomial of $T$ is the largest of the invariant factors so that $m_T(x) = (x^2(x-1)^2(x-2)^3)$ and the characteristic polynomial will be the product of $d_1 d_2 d_3$. Question: what is the appropriate Jordan normal form of T? Since 0, 1 and are repeated roots and 2 is repeated 3 times. Does that give me Jordan blocks $$ J_1 =  \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ $$ J_2 = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ and  $$ J_3 = \begin{pmatrix}2 & 1 \\0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$$","['jordan-normal-form', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
