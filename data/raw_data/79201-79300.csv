I know that classic result, that $[A^k]_{ij}$ shows the $k$ length walks from $i$ to $j$, and when $\rho(A) < 1$, then exist $(I-A)^{-1}$, and the Neumann-series of $A$ converges to it. Furthermore because $A$ is nonnegative $\rho(A)=\lambda_{\max}$ without abolute value, and $(I-A)^{-1}$ is also nonnegative. That's all I know.

$$I=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\tanh(x)\,\tanh(2x)}{x^2}\;dx$$ Here is what I have done so far. I tried integration by parts using $u=\tanh(x)\,\tanh(2x)$ and $dv=\frac{dx}{x^2}$, I got
$$\begin{align}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\tanh(x)\,\tanh(2x)}{x^2}\;dx&=-\left.\frac{\tanh(x)\,\tanh(2x)}{x}\right|_{0}^{\infty}+2\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tanh(2x)\,\text{sech}(2x)}{x}\;dx\\&=2\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tanh(2x)\,\text{sech}(2x)}{x}\;dx\end{align}$$
At this part I'm stuck. I'm thinking of using Frullani's integral but I'm having trouble to find a relation as such $\tanh(2x)\,\text{sech}(2x)=f(ax)-f(bx)$. I also tried using differentiation under integral sign by considering
$$I(a,b)=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\tanh(ax)\,\tanh(bx)}{x^2}\;dx$$
then
$$\frac{dI}{da}=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\text{sech}^2(ax)\,\tanh(bx)}{x}\;dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\tanh(bx)-\tanh^2(ax)\tanh(bx)}{x}\;dx$$

The surjectivity is almost immediate since the equivalence relation can restrictes a $S^3$ and for the fibre for the fact that $S^1$ act on $S^3$, $i.e.$ $(w,(z_1,z_2))\mapsto w\cdot(z_1,z_2)\in S^3$ and then $\mathbb{C}P^1=S^3/S^1$. For Ehresmann's Lemma $\pi$ induces a fibre bundle since the $S^3$ is compact (and then $\pi$ is proper function).
But I had a trouble to prove $\pi$ is a submersion because I dont know how to express the derivative $D\pi$ since that is a projection for the equivalece relation. How am I supposed to derive the function $\pi$?","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
1017142,Is there an interpretation of higher cohomology groups in terms of group extensions?,"1) Consider a group $G$ and a $G$-module $A$. Then it is well-known that there is a $1-1$ correspondence between elements of $H^2(G,A),$ and group extensions $1\rightarrow A \rightarrow H\rightarrow G \rightarrow 1,$ inducing the given action of $G$ on $A$, modulo the equivalence of extensions. So my question is: Is there a similar interpretation of $H^n(G,A)$ for $n >2$? In particular, do the elements of $H^n(G,A)$ correspond to the $(n-1)$-extensions 
  $$1 \rightarrow A \rightarrow H_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow H_{n-1} \rightarrow G \rightarrow 1,$$
  again modulo the obvious equivalence? If not, is there another natural interpretation? I am aware that the fact that $H^1$ does not have an interpretation of this type probably suggests the negative answer (however, in the ""analogous"" module case, $\mathrm{Ext}^0$ does not correspond to isomorphisms, but to homomorphisms in general). But I would be interested in other interpretations as well (in particular, if this interpretation generalizes the one for $H^1$ and $H^2$). Also I do not see whether and how could the grop $G$ induce an action on $A$ in the case of $n$-extensions. 2) Also, since $H^2(G, A) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}^{2}(\mathbb{Z}, A)$ and there is a correspondence between elements of $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathbb{Z}[G]}^{n}(\mathbb{Z}, G)$ and $2$-extensions 
$$0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow H_1 \rightarrow H_{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0,$$
so there is a correspondence between extensions of $G$ by $A$ (with the given action) ad $2$-extensions of this form. How does this correspondence look like? And can it be generalized to get the correspondence as in 1)? Thanks in advance for any help and/or references.","['modules', 'homological-algebra', 'group-cohomology', 'group-theory']"

1017169,Upper bound for the widest matrix with no two subsets of columns with the same vector sum,"Over at PPCG there is an ongoing contest going on to find the largest matrix without a certain property, called property $X$. The description is as follows (copied from the question). A circulant matrix is fully specified by its first row $r$. The remaining rows are each cyclic permutations of the row $r$ with offset equal to the row index. We will allow circulant matrices which are not square so that they are simply missing some of their last rows. We do however always assume that the number of rows is no more than the number of columns. For example, consider the following $3\times5$ circulant matrix. $$\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1&1&1\\
    1&1&0&1&1\\
    1&1&1&0&1\end{pmatrix}$$ We say a matrix has property $X$ if it contains two non-empty sets of columns with non-identical indices which have the same (vector) sum. The vector sum of two columns is simply an element-wise summation of the two columns.  That is the sum of two columns containing $x$ elements each is another column containing $x$ elements. The matrix above trivially has property $X$ as the first and last columns are the same. The identity matrix never has property $X$. If we just remove the last column of the matrix above then we get an example which does not have property $X$.   The score of a matrix is defined to be the number columns divided by the number of rows. The following matrix therefore does not have property $X$ and gives a score of $4/3$. \begin{pmatrix}1&0&1&1\\
    1&1&0&1\\
    1&1&1&0\end{pmatrix}$$ The task they were given is to find the highest scoring circulant matrix whose entries are all 0 or 1 and which does not have property $X$. So far the numerical evidence points towards an upper bound of two. Is there an upper bound of $2$ for this score? The highest scoring matrix found so far has a score of 36/19 by Peter Taylor.

1017211,Rademacher complexity of regularized linear function class: does it depend on dimension or not?,"I am going through some lecture notes on Learning Theory here: http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~tewari/LT_SP2008.html trying to learn about Rademacher complexities. 
I'm getting confused about the Rademacher complexity of linear function classes.
Consider $F=\{f_w(x)=w^Tx|w\in R^d,\|w\|_2\le 1\}; \|x\|_2\le 1$. Denote the empirical Rademacher complexity of $F$ by $R_N(F)$. (N is the number of points from which this is estimated.) Using the Dudley theorem, as in Lecture 15, Sec. 2.1, we get that $R_N(F)\le \sqrt{\frac{d}{N}}$. However, using some elementary calculations as in Lecture 17, sec. 2.1, we get $R_N(F)\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$. My question is, should $R_N(F)$ depend on the dimension $d$ or not? Is $\sqrt{d}$ just an artefact of the proof technique in the first case? (First I thought that the application of Dudley theorem as above was not assuming that $\|x\|_2\le 1$, but it must do because otherwise we would not have $|w^Tx|\le 1$ and so the upper limit of the integral would not be 1.)","['machine-learning', 'statistics', 'probability-theory', 'analysis', 'probability']"

The problem is the following: Let $X$ be a random vector taking values in $(\mathbb{R},\cal{B})$ and $\varphi(x)$ a random variable on $(\mathbb{R},\cal{B})$. Let $Y$ a random variable on $(\Omega,\sigma)$ and $E|Y|, E|\varphi(X)|,E|Y\varphi(X)|<\infty$. I want to prove that
$$E(\varphi(X)Y|X)=\varphi(X)E(X|Y)$$
This is my attemp: First, we must see that $\varphi(X)E(Y|X)$ is measurable in $\sigma(X)$, but it is obviously given the definition of $E(Y|X)$ and being $\varphi$ measurable. So the  problem will be solved if we prove that $$\int_D\varphi(X)E(Y|X)dP=\int_D\varphi(X)YdP \hspace{0.4cm} \forall D\in \sigma(X)$$ Considering the properties of the integral and the construction of random variables from indicators, it will (almost) proven if we can see the last equality for $\varphi=I_B$.

By definition of $E(Y|X)$, $$\int_{D'}E(Y|X)dP=\int_{D'}YdP \hspace{0.4cm} \forall D'\in \sigma(X)$$ So the previous equality is true, just taking $D'=D \cap \{X\in B\}$.","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'conditional-probability']"

$ ${\partial{v}\over\partial{t}} = {-2b \over a+b}u + -(b+a)^2v + d{\partial{v}^2\over\partial{x^2}}

{-2b \over a+b} & -(b+a)^2 \\\end{pmatrix}, D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\
0 & d \\\end{pmatrix}
$ Since this is a linear equation, one should be able to apply the method of Separation of Variables.  I've gone through the exercise of separating variables for single variable models in one or more spatial dimensions many times.  However, I've never seen a completely worked example where there are two coupled equations.  My intuition tells me to start with: $\vec w = \begin{pmatrix}u(x,t)\\v(x,t)\\\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix}

Differentiating with respect to x and t, I obtain: $\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1'(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2'(t)\\\end{pmatrix} = A\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix} + D\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1''(x)h_1(t)\\\phi_2''(x)h_2(t)\\\end{pmatrix}

$, where k is the wavenumber and $\lambda $ is the eigenvalue. I find this really unsatisfying, because it seems to fall out of nowhere. My questions are: Is there a general method for separating variables in coupled linear PDEs or PDEs written in vector form? Is there a book/paper/tutorial that I can use to help me work this out in all of its details? Is there some deeper theory that I need to first understand?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'systems-of-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
1017331,Degree of splitting field less than n! [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Degree of splitting field divides n! [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 7 years ago . I've been asked to prove that if a polynomial $f\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ has degree $n$, then the splitting field of $f$ has degree less than or equal to $n!$. That is, $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n):\mathbb Q]\leq n!$, where $\alpha_i$ are the roots of $f$. My approach to this question is to use the tower law, to arrive at the equation:
$$[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n):\mathbb{Q}]=[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})][\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1}):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-2})]\cdots[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1):\mathbb{Q}]$$ Clearly $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1):\mathbb{Q}]\leq n$, since the minimum polynomial of $\alpha_1$ divides $f$.

The recurrence being linear, we assume this closed form is a linear combination of 3 other functions, with coefficients $\alpha, \beta$ and $ \gamma$. The first method suggested in the book is clear to me: set simple values for the constants, since the function will be the same for all of them, and try to guess A, B and C and prove it by induction.

The general idea is that a random variable $Y_{i}$ may depend on other values $Y_{j}$ where $j \neq i$.  $Y_{i}$ can be a measurement at location $i$ that is correlated with measurement $Y_{j}$ at location $j$. In a CAR model, these variables follow the conditional mean: $$E(Y_{i}|\text{all }Y_{j\neq i}) = \mu_{i} + \rho\Sigma_{j\neq i}w_{ij}(Y_{j}-\mu_{j})$$ where $\mu_{i}$ is the mean of $Y_{i}$, $w_{ij}$ are weights that determine the influence of location $j$ on $i$ and $\rho$ describes a positive or negative direction. We also know that the conditional variance is: $$Var(Y_{i}|\text{all }Y_{j\neq i})=\sigma^{2}$$ I want to know how to derive the covariance matrix: $$V = (I - \rho W)^{-1}M$$ in which $M$ is a $n\times n$ matrix of conditional variances $(\sigma_{1}^{2},\dots, \sigma_{n}^{2})$ and $W$ is a $n\times n$ matrix of weights $w_{ij}$ with zeros on the diagonal. I'm guessing it should be a somewhat straightforward calculation. Mainly, $$\Sigma_{ij} = cov(Y_{i},Y_{j}) = E[(Y_{i}-E[Y_{i}])(Y_{j}-E[Y_{j}])]$$ However, I can't see how to obtain the first term from this operation. I think and correct me if I'm wrong, $E(Y_{i},Y_{j})$ under this model should be zero. That should simplify the derivation. This is the description I have been reading, in case it may be helpful. The original paper by Besag assumes the existence of such a covariance matrix, but as far as I understand, he doesn't derive it. Any help would be appreciated. UPDATE : There is a very simple way to prove the covariance matrix. If we use the vector of all $Y_{i}$ as $Y$ and define the CAR model in terms of $Y$: $$Y = \rho W Y + M$$ (assuming $\mu_{i}=0$ and with a diagonal $n\times n$ matrix sharing the same $\sigma^{2}$) Then, $$Y = (I - \rho W)^{-1}M$$ and it is quite obvious that a distribution $Y = N(0, (I - \rho W)^{-1}M)$ gives the desired result. However, I'm not quite satisfied with this result since I had to redefine the CAR model, which no longer has the expected value as above.","['statistics', 'conditional-expectation', 'covariance']"

1018525,Is every smooth $\mathbb{R}$-variety isomorphic to an affine variety?,"I sadly don't know anything about formal GAGA yet, but I am at least trying to follow my intuition as often as possible. In differential geometry we know that we can embedd every smooth $\mathbb{R}$-manifold into some $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ (one can even make precise what this $m$ is, if one wishes). Note that for complex manifolds the analogous does not work in general. Now morally, I would like to see a smooth manifold over $\mathbb{R}$ as a smooth $\mathbb{R}$-variety and vice versa. (although this probably fails as $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraically closed, weird things could happen) For example, projective space should not be affine as a variety (global sections!), but in manifolds I am told that I can embedd it into some $\mathbb{R}^m$. Thus, I am very confused. Either, by some magic every smooth $\mathbb{R}$-variety can be embedded in $\mathbb{A}^m$ or more likely my intuition for ""what an $\mathbb{R}$-manifold should correspond to in the language of algebraic geometry"" (which is already very handwavy) is simply wrong. I guess it is rather the later, and I would be happy if anyone could help me clear my confusion. (My professor of Differential Geometry said today that the fact 'every smooth vector bundle is a direct summand of a trivial vector bundle' should correspond to the fact 'every vector bundle is a locally free sheaf, thus a projective sheaf'.

1018574,Cardinality of infinite sets - Help with intuition,"Yesterday I studied the cardinality of infinite sets and, I must say, it was the first time I have ever distrusted math. That is, it was the first time I have not bought - hook, line and sinker - something about math that was proven to me by a mathematics professor. This is not to say that I think it is untrue. I am saying that the truth of the cardinality of infinite sets is so at odds with my intuition that I am having trouble believing it.  And I could use a bit more explanation, I think, to clear up a few things. The distinction between the rules governing finite and infinite sets. For example, we can say that the odd numbers are a proper subset of the integers. We know this absolutely, correct? Yet, we can then prove using diagonalization that the set containing all odds and the set containing all integers have the same cardinality, which is Aleph-null. How is that we can allow such discontinuity in our understanding of these sets? How can both of those two statements be simultaneously true? How, if A is a proper subset of B, can |A|=|B|? I know this doesn't hold when we limit the conversation to finite sets. However, I don't understand why we can't make the same assertion about these two infinite sets - or at least not definitively say they both have cardinality Aleph-null. Proving that the reals don't form a bijective map to Aleph-null. This was proven by trying to map the reals onto the naturals. More specifically, the professor considered only the continuum and showed that the continuum can't map to the naturals and therefore neither can the reals. The professor did this by showing that any list of natural numbers could never contain all the reals because we can always create at least one new number not contained in the list. HOWEVER, it felt like a bit of flashy wording to me. If we can do this and then say ""look, we didn't account for this number"" and furthermore not be allowed to say ""okay, but I still have this natural number to which I can map that real number"" in this instance, why do the same arguments not apply to other instances? That is, why can't I do the exact same thing when dealing with the mapping between odds/integers? I know this isn't the typical question for stackexchange, but I really want to nail this down.

So I have the limit: $$\lim_{x\to c} \frac {x\sin(\frac 1x) - c\sin(\frac 1c)}{x-c}$$ Here's what I've got so far: I know I need to get that $x-c$ to cancel on bottom and that I need a $\sin(\frac 1x)$ or $\sin(\frac 1c)$ (either will evaluate to $\sin(\frac 1c)$ after I apply the limit) in my answer so I added $c\sin(\frac 1x)-c\sin(\frac 1x)$ to the numerator.

1018685,Stream functions and divergence?,"We see that the existence of a stream function guarantees that the vector field has zero 
  divergence or, equivalently, is source free. The converse is also true on simply connected 
  regions of $\mathbb{R}^2$ Why does the region have to be simply connected on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for the converse to be true? If the vector field has zero divergence,
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{g}}{\partial{y}} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} = -\frac{\partial{g}}{\partial{y}}$$ Integrating either side with respect to the appropriate variable would give you the stream line function. Doesn't this show that if a vector field has zero divergence it has a stream function no matter what?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
1018690,A functional equation with no solution,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to (0,\infty)$ be a differentiable function satisfying 
$$f(f(x))=f^\prime(x)$$for each $x$. Show no such function exists. I got this problem in an exam. I haven't done anything significant with it. I have found that $f^\prime=f\circ f>0$ so $f(f(x))>f(0)$ hence we have $f^\prime(x)>f(0)$. But I have no idea how to use it. I tried to apply the mean value theorem on $$\frac{f(f(x))-f(0)}{f(x)}=f^\prime(c)=\frac{f^\prime(x)-f(0)}{f(x)}$$ but that doesn't lead anywhere. Can someone help me?

1018757,Weak convergence in $l_p$ implies pointwise convergence? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : weak convergence in $l^p$ implies bounded and pointwise convergence (1 answer) Closed 7 years ago . Could someone please share their thoughts on this one: Consider at $l_p(Y)$, for $1<p<\infty$ with the counting measure on $Y$. Show that if a sequence weakly converges in $l_p(Y)$ then it would converge pointwise in Y. Show that the converse holds only when Y is finite.
