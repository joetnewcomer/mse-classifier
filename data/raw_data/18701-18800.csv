155265,How to solve $y=\frac{(x-\sin x)}{ (1-\cos x)}$,"I only see numerical approaches to solve this equation. Is there an analytical solution to solve $x$ as a function of $y$ for the range $(0,2 \pi)$? If there is no solution, is it possible to proof it?",['analysis']

155272,Zeros in the complex plane and convergence,"I'm doing some number theory which requires some work in $\mathbb{C}$, but unfortunately my complex analysis is a little rusty. A text I am reading states the following: ...and given that $\sum_{\rho}|\rho|^{-2}$ converges, it follows that the product $\prod \limits_\rho (1-\frac{z}{\rho})e^{z/\rho}$ converges to an entire function with zeros at $z=\rho$ and nowhere else. Could anyone explain, preferably without going into too much detail (just refreshing my memory!) why this is? Here, $\rho$ ranges over the set of zeros of an integral function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ of order 1, which is not identically zero. It's obvious that the product is zero at each $\rho$; what do we need to know it converges to an entire function with zeros nowhere else? For convergence, do we simply need to bound the modulus above by some finite value at each $z$? And since it's an infinite product, how do we confirm that it's zero nowhere else; a lower bound of the same manner? Finally, what tells us it is entire? Again, given that it's an infinite product I don't know how trivial that claim is; not very hard I'm sure but perhaps requiring some small justification. As I said, I have probably learned all this at some point in my life so no need for extraordinary detail, just a brief explanation would be very helpful. It all seems vaguely reminiscent of a course I took on Riemann surfaces a few years back. Thanks!","['convergence-divergence', 'products', 'complex-analysis']"
155274,Poisson summation formula and Schwartz functions,"I am reading a proof of the Poisson summation formula which states that (with my version of the Fourier transform - I think they sometimes vary by a constant factor) for $f$ a Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}$ (that is, a smooth function with all derivatives of $f(x)$ of all orders decay faster than any polynomial function as $|x| \to \infty$), the following relationship holds: $$\sum \limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}f(n) = \sum \limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}\hat{f}(2\pi n)$$ where $\hat{f}$ denotes the Fourier transform. The proof goes as follows: define 2 functions on $\mathbb{T} = \{z: |z| = 1\}$ by $F, G: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C}$ by $F(\theta) = \sum \limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}\hat{f}(2\pi n) e^{2 \pi i n \theta}$, and $G(\theta) = \sum \limits_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}f(\theta + k)$. Then take Fourier transforms and show they are equal. After showing also that $F$ and $G$ are both Schwartz functions on $\mathbb{T}$, we apply uniqueness of Fourier series to show that $F=G$. Now uniqueness here relies very much on the fact that both $F$ and $G$ are Schwartz functions on $\mathbb{T}$: but a Schwartz function on $\mathbb{T}$ is simply an element of $C^\infty (\mathbb{T})$, i.e. a smooth function on $\mathbb{T}$. So, my question is this: how do we know (or show) that $F$ and $G$ are smooth? It is clear both are periodic, so it will suffice to show smoothness within their respective periods I suppose. $f$ is Schwartz on $\mathbb{R}$ which means it is smooth, but we are taking an infinite sum of translations of $f$, so it is not manifestly clear that either $F$ or $G$ will remain smooth. How do we show this? I guess we need to make use of the fact that at large values $f$ is very fast-decaying to show that most terms are ""insignificant"" in the sums, but whenever I tried to prove the smoothness formally it became messy. Is there a nice trick to showing $F$ and $G$ are smooth on $\mathbb{T}$? I would be very grateful for a proof of the fact. Many thanks in advance.","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'derivatives', 'analysis']"
155282,"What are the $n$-th degree minimal polynomials for $L^p([-1,1])$?","It is known (even by me) that the Chebyshev polynomial of degree $n$ (of the first kind) is the minimal polynomial in the space $L^{\infty}([-1,1])$ for a fixed $n$ and leading coefficient $2^{n-1}$ . However, what are the minimal polynomials for the $p$ -norm in general for a fixed $n$ ? Does there exist a general answer? This is my first question here and I apologize if it is not up to par. Feel free to edit, migrate or close it if necessary.","['normed-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'polynomials']"
155289,Need help in determining where this pascal's triangle-like sequence comes from.,"I have a very interesting problem in that a program that I am running has generated a sequence of numbers that act like the pascal's triangle but have somehow built more structure into it. I have been puzzling over this for a while now and cant figure out how the sequence works. I have put it half the triangle up to n = 14 so the whole thing should look like: 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 ... etc... so notice that the numbers contained within the brackets add up to the right number for the triangle, for n = 4, (2 4) add to 6 and so on. I'm hoping that someone might know where this sequence comes from or how to generalize this solution so that I can calculate the numbers in the triangle for every n. Thanks!

(f! n m) => constructs a function that takes a sequence 
         => of length n and looks up the bit value of m
         => which specifies the type of values that are
         => given to the output. (more clearly shown in

(map (f! 2 15)[[0 0] [0 1] [1 0] [1 1]]) => (1 1 1 1)

(T! n m) => generates a cellular automata type transform 
         => that takes an input sequence X and maps (f! n m)
         => across every element of X
((T! 2 7) [1 0 1 0 1 0 1]) => [1 1 1 1 1 1 1]

I have grouped the inputs together into different counts using a pattern I discovered about the inputs and came up with a triangle. I'm hoping someone can cast a bit of light on what is happening! When I turn the inputs into a binary string, I get these groupings that correspond to elements in the triangle. It seems that these groups grow a certain way, but I'm not a mathematician and so are not good and generalising patterns. For N=5

155297,"Can one construct a ""Cayley diagram"" that lacks only an inverse?","My group theory text asks for an example of a Cayley-like diagram that exhibits all the properties of a group except ( only ) that at least some elements lack an inverse. Is it possible to construct such a diagram? Nathan Carter p. 24 Question 2.15. in Visual Group Theory (in the context of this question) defines a group as a ""collection of actions"" that satisfies four rules: There is a predefined list of actions [generators] that never changes. Every action is reversible. Every action is deterministic. Any sequence of consecutive actions is also an action. Clearly (2) will be violated in any diagram that is constructed by adding new node, $n$, to the diagram for a group $G$ by one-way arrows for each of the generators in $G$, since it provides no way to reach $n$ from any other nodes, so that paths starting at $n$ (only) cannot be reversed. This will be the case regardless of what nodes in $G$ each of the arrows from $n$ lead to. For example, starting with $G=D_4$: But, while this diagram satisfies rules (1) and (4), doesn't it also violate (3) because, for example, $r^4=e$ and (starting from $n$) $r^4=r^{-1}$ even though $r^{-1}\neq e$? EDIT: As discussed below, this figure does not, in fact, violate (3): the $r^{-1}$ mentioned above (the one starting at $n$) does not exist. Also, it does matter where the arrows from $n$ are connected: they must be connected to $G$ in a way that follows $G$'s rules. In the diagram above, for example, if the dotted path had been chosen for $f$ instead of the one indicated, the diagram would violate (3). Rule (3) will always be satisfied in a diagram where the connections from the added node replicate outgoing connections from a node in $G$ (here $m$). The answer provided in the book's key focuses on the fact that (2) requires that any diagram ...cannot have two arrows of the same type pointing to the same destination from two different sources. However, while this is certainly a property of (all?) diagrams (including the one above) that violate (2), it is not sufficient to violate (2), and can result in the violation of other rules instead. For example simply ""rewiring"" one of the cyclic actions in $D_4$ so that it points ""to the same destination from two different sources"" can produce a diagram that satisfies, (2) but violates (3): The example offered in the key, violates not only (2), but (3) and (4) as well: Is it possible to construct a diagram that satisfies rules (1), (3), and (4) while violating (2)?","['group-theory', 'visualization']"

155348,Theorem of liouville,"Consider two entire functions with no zeroes and having a ratio equal to unity at infinity. Use Liouville’s Theorem to show that they are in fact the same function. My attempt
Consider $h(z) = f(z)/g(z)$.
First of all, $h$ is entire, since $f$ and $g$ are entire, and $g(z)$ is nonzero for all $z$ in $\mathbb{C}$. The fact that $\lim_{z→\infty} h(z) = \lim_{z→\infty} f(z)/g(z) = 1$ suggests that $h(z)$ is bounded as well. Why: Since $\lim_{z→\infty} f(z)/g(z) = 1$, there exists $N > 0$ such that $|f(z)/g(z) - 1| < 1$ for all $|z| > N$.
(Note that I am taking $\epsilon = 1$ for concreteness.) Then, $|f(z)/g(z) - 1| \geq ||f(z)/g(z)| - 1|$
$\implies ||f(z)/g(z)| - 1| < 1$
$\implies |f(z)/g(z)| - 1 < 1$ or $1 - |f(z)/g(z)| < 1$
$\implies 0 < |f(z)/g(z)| < 2$. That is, $|f(z)/g(z)|$ is bounded above by $2$ for $|z| > N$.
Moreover, we know that $|f(z)/g(z)|$ has a maximum $M$ on $|z| \leq N$ by maximum modulus principle (or simply from $|z| \leq N$ being compact). Hence, $|f(z)/g(z)|$ is bounded above by $\max \{2, M\}$ for all z in $\mathbb{C}$. Hence, $h(z)$ is constant by Liouville's Theorem, i.e. $h(z) = f(z)/g(z) = c$ for some constant $c$. Since this is true for all $z$ in $\mathbb{C}$, taking the limit as $z\to \infty$ yields $c = 1$.
Hence $f(z) = g(z)$ for all $z$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Is correct my work?",['complex-analysis']

However, I'm stuck on part b and I don't understand how the 1/$2^{n-1}$ given in the problem is to be interpreted because if you toss the coin twice it makes it seem like HH, and TT each have a probability of 1/2 which is not the case. The sample space of two tosses would be {HH, HT, TH, TT} and each would have a probability of 1/4 and following this logic I arrived at 15/16 so I believe this is the correct thinking which makes the problem even more confusing.

155392,Existence of valuation rings in an algebraic function field of one variable,"The following theorem is a slightly modified version of Theorem 1, p.6 of Chevalley's Introduction to the theory of algebraic functions of one variable.
He proved it using Zorn's lemma.
However, Weil wrote, in his review of the book, that this can be proved without it.
I wonder how. Theorem Let $k$ be a field.
Let $K$ be a finitely generated extension field of $k$ of transcendence degree one.
Let $A$ be a subring of $K$ containing $k$.
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $A$.
Then there exists a valuation ring $R$ of $K$ dominating $A_P$. EDIT Weil wrote: One might observe here that, in a function-field of dimension 1, every valuation-ring is finitely generated over the field of constants, and therefore , if a slightly different arrangement had been adopted, the use of Zorn's lemma (or of Zermelo's axiom) could have been avoided altogether; since Theorem 1 is formulated only for such fields, this treatment would have been more consistent, and the distinct features of dimension 1 would have appeared more clearly. EDIT We can assume that $A$ contains a transcendental element $x$ over $k$(otherwise the theorem would be trivial).
If $A$ is finitely generated over $k$, we can prove the theorem without using Zorn's lemma;
It is well known that the integral closure $B$ of $A$ in $K$ is finitely generated as an $A$-module. Hence $B$ is Noetherian and integrally closed.
We can assume $P ≠ 0$.
Since $B$ is integral over $A$, there exists a prime ideal ideal $M$ of $B$ which lies over $P$.
Since $B$ is Noetherian, this can be proved without Zorn's lemma.
Since dim $B$ = 1, $B_M$ is a discrete valuation ring dominating $A_P$.
I wonder if Weil was talking about this case. EDIT [July 10, 2012]
As the answers to this question show, the following line in the above is wrong: ""Since $B$ is Noetherian, this can be proved without Zorn's lemma.""
Surely this can be proved without Zorn's lemma, but it's not because $B$ is Noetherian, but because $B$ is finitely generated as an $A$-module. EDIT [July 13, 2012]

Then there exists an injective map $g:[0,1] \to Y$ such that $g(0) = f(0)$ and $g(1) = f(1)$. Obviously, the problem is trivial in many cases, but gets tough when you consider ""wild"" curves.  Below I'll discuss how I've tried to solve it, but feel free to ignore it if you know the answer. My first idea was to start Zorn's lemma argument using a sequence of maps $f_0,f_1,f_2,f_3,\dots$ with $f_0 = f$ and $f_0([0,1]) \supseteq f_1([0,1]) \supseteq f_2([0,1]) \supseteq \cdots$ and trying to find a bound for the chain, but it seems this fails because given compact path-connected subsets $X_0,X_1,\dots$ where $X_0 \supseteq X_1 \supseteq \cdots$, the intersection $\bigcap_{k=1}^\infty X_k$ is not necessarily path connected.  For example, if $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a segment of the (closed) topologist's sine curve, then the family $S \cup \bar{B}_{1/n}(0)$ provide a counterexample. The other approach seemed to be trying to define a sequence of functions $f_0,f_1,\dots$ where each $f_n$ is ""closer"" to being injective than the one before it, and such that the sequence converges in some meaningful way to an injective function, or at least to a function that allows us to use a simpler method to finish the problem.  However, I don't really know enough analysis to follow through with this approach, so I'm asking for help here.  Any solution would be great, and solutions a method similar to what I've mentioned above would be doubly appreciated.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

155495,Solve the general cubic by factoring,"After learning Cardano's solution of the cubic, I decided to look at Ferrari's solution of the quartic (both articles on Wikipedia). At the end of the article on the quartic function was an an alternate method to solve the cubic by factoring into two quadratic terms - something like factoring the monic quartic $$x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$$ into $$(x^2+px+q)(x^2+rx+s).$$ They used Vieta's formula (correct me if I am wrong) in order to acquire the ""resolvent"" cubic (I assume that is a cubic required to be solved for algebraic solutions of the quartic)  - what they essentially did was expanded the two quadratic factors, and set them equal to their corresponding coefficients. I tried to do this with the monic cubic, first attempting to use three linear factors, then attempting to use one linear and one quadratic factor.

If there was a good argument that say that this group is at most of order $6$ then I can clain that since the only groups of order $6$ are $S_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_6$ and $S_3$ is non abelian then this group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_6$.

155822,Constructing arithmetic progressions,"It is known that in the sequence of primes there exists arithmetic progressions of primes of arbitrary length. This was proved by Ben Green and Terence Tao in 2006 . However the proof given is a nonconstructive one. I know the following theorem from Burton gives some criteria on how large the common difference must be. Let $n > 2$. If all the terms of the arithmetic progression
  $$
p, p+d, \ldots, p+(n-1)d
$$
  are prime numbers then the common difference $d$ is divisible by every prime $q <n$. So for instance if you want a sequence of primes in arithmetic progression of length $5$ ie
$$
p, p+d, \ldots, p+4d
$$
you need that $d \geq 6$. Using this we can get that the prime $p=5$ and $d = 6$ will result in a sequence primes in arithmetic progression of length $5$. So my question is what are the known techniques for constructing a sequence of primes of length $k$? How would one find the ""first"" prime in the sequence or even the ""largest prime"" that would satisfy the sequence (assuming there is one)? Also, while the theorem gives a lower bound for $d$, is it known if it is the sharpest lowest bound there is?

I'm curious what the zero divisors are. My hunch is that the zero divisors are precisely the functions whose zero set contains an open interval. My thinking is that if $f$ is a function which is at least zero on an open interval $(a,b)$, then there exists some function which is nonzero on $(a,b)$, but zero everywhere else on $[0,1]\setminus(a,b)$. Conversely, if $f$ is not zero on any open interval, then every zero is isolated in a sense. But if $fg=0$ for some $g$, then $g$ is zero everywhere except these isolated points, but continuity would imply that it is also zero at the zeros of $f$, but then $g=0$, so $f$ is not a zero divisor.

The force acting upon the particle is $F = (y , 2x$). Now how i have attempted the problem is I paramaterized the line $x = y$ to be $r = < t, t >$ by letting $x = t$ which means that $y = t$ too. (I'm hoping that this is how you do it, it's been a while since ive done that maths course) I know the formula for work is:  The integral of $F\cdot dr$ - thus meaning I have to differentiate $r$ to get $dr = < 1, 1>$ then finding the force acting on the particle using $F$ and the particles position of $(x,y)$ to be $(1,1)$ (i.e. i substituted this point into $F$) so $F= (1,2)$. Then taking the dot product between the two i get $3$.  Then taking the integral between $1$ and $0$ I get the answer to be $3$.  Now the answer in the textbook says the answer is $1.5$ :( bummer.
