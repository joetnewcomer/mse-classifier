314244,Scaling a uniform distribution - Probability,"I just have a simple question on scaling a uniform distribution. 
I know that uniform distribution has probability density of $1/(b-a)$ defined on the interval a to b. My textbook says that we can scale the distribution to be between (0,1) and have a constant density of 1 by doing the following: Suppose X is a random variable. Then $U=(X-a)/(b-a)$ so $X=a+(b-a)U$. Thus the expected value E(X) = E($a + (b -a)U$) which equals $(a+b)/2$. I don't understand why we subtract a from X and then divide by b - a. The intuition just doesn't make sense to me. -How does this make it so that the distribution is defined from 0 to 1 with density 1 instead of the original definition on (a,b) with density $1/(b-a)$? -Also, what is the mathematically correct way to derive E(U)?",['statistics']

314290,Differentiability of a function at a point,"My high-school calculus teacher has asserted that a function $f(x)$ can only fail to be differentiable at a point $x=a$ if one of the following is true: The function is discontinuous at $x=a$: $\lim_{x\to a}f(x) \ne f(a)$ The function has a cusp or vertical tangent at $x=a$: $\lim_{x\to a}\left|{{f(x)-f(a)}\over{x-a}}\right| = \infty$ The function has a corner at $x=a$: $\lim_{x\to a^+} {{f(x)-f(a)}\over{x-a}} \ne \lim_{x\to a^-} {{f(x)-f(a)}\over{x-a}}$ While in most cases that is probably correct, I find it somewhat hard to swallow that it is that way for all functions.  Specifically, the function $$f(x)=\begin{cases}x\sin \ln x^2, & x\ne0 \\ 0, & x=0\end{cases}$$ is most definitely not differentiable at $x=0$, but it also doesn't appear to satisfy any of the properties listed above. The derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}f(x)$ of the function for $x\ne0$ appears to be $\sin{{\ln x^2}}+2\cos{{\ln x^2}}$, which doesn't show any signs of increasing without bounds as $x\to0$ or suddenly changing at $x=0$, and $f$ is most definitely continuous at that point. So, the Question is:
What's up with$f$?  Does it actually fall into one of the cases above, or are they only good as a rough guide for some sorts of functions?",['derivatives']

314324,Hyperelliptic curve on abelian variety,"There is serious flaw in the following argument, but I have yet to see what it is: Let $C$ be a genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve in an abelian variety $A$ (over an algebraically closed field with characteristic $\neq$2), such that the automorphism $-1$ of $A$ descends to the hyperelliptic involution on $C$. The 2:1 projection $C\to \mathbb{P}^1$ is just the image of $C$ in the Kummer variety of $A$, that is $\mbox{Km}(A)=A/\pm$, and so $C$ contains $2g+2$ 2-torsion points of $A$. Let $2_A$ be the morphism multiplication by 2 on $A$, and let $C'=2_A(C)$. This is a (possibly singular) curve on $A$, and the image of $C'$ in $\mbox{Km}(A)$ is also rational (since it is the image of $2_{\mbox{Km}(A)}$ restricted to the projection of $C$ in $\mbox{Km}(A)$). If we take the normalization of $C'$, let's say $\pi:N\to C'$, then we get a map $C\to N$, that lifts $2_A:C\to C'$. Now, $N$ is hyperelliptic and if $g\geq 2$, we must have that $g_N$ (the genus of $N$) is less than $g$, unless the map $C\to N$ is an isomorphism. The map can never be an isomorphism, given that the $2g+2$ torsion points on $C$ all go to 0 in $C'$, and above each point in $C'$ there are at most 2 points in $N$. One very false implication of this reasoning is that if $C$ is of genus 2, for example, and $A$ is the jacobian of $C$, then $N$ would have to be an elliptic curve! This would mean that every 2-dimensional abelian variety is isogenous to the product of elliptic curves, which is very very false! What's wrong with this argument?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

314378,Derivation of weak form for variational problem,"My question is about understanding the derivation of the weak form of a variational problem (to be used for the solution via the finite element method). The problem is as follows (it is an image processing problem, $\mathbf{u}$ is a 2D vector field of displacements I is an image function (see Horn-Schunk optical flow algorithm)): Minimize the following functional w.r.t. the vector field $\mathbf{u}$
$$E(\mathbf{u}) = \int_\Omega \left\|\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla I + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\right\|^2dx + \lambda\int_\Omega \nabla \mathbf{u} : \nabla \mathbf{u} dx$$ (: denotes the Frobenius inner product http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_inner_product#Frobenius_product ) The apparent weak form of the problem is given in the following form ( http://code.google.com/p/debiosee/wiki/DemosOptiocFlowHornSchunck ): $$E(\mathbf{u}) = \int_\Omega \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla I + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\right) \left(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla I\right) dx + \lambda\int_\Omega\nabla\mathbf{u}:\nabla\mathbf{v}dx$$ Where $\mathbf{v}$ is the test function. What I would like to know is if there is a direct way to come to this conclusion from the original problem or the way to go is to formulate the weak form of the Euler-Lagrange equation of the original functional? Additionally I would like to know if any of you knew about a vector calculus textbook you could recommend for mastering these kinds of operations in their vector form without working out the derivation componentwise?

314384,Boundedness for Reaction Diffusion BVP with Arbitrary Exponent $\alpha$,"Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be open, $U_{T}$ and $\Gamma_{T}$ be the parabolic cylinder and boundary of $U$ for arbitrary $0\leq t\leq T$, respectively, and suppose $u$ solves
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
u_{t}-\Delta u=u^{\alpha}&\text{in}\;U_{T}\\
u=g&\text{on}\;\Gamma_{T}\end{array}\right.
$$
where $0\leq g\leq1$.  If $u\in\mathscr{C}^{2,1}(U_{T})\cap\mathscr{C}(U_{T}\cup\Gamma_{T})$, then determine which values of $\alpha$ yield uniformly bounded solutions for all $T>0$. First of all, I just want to say I am only starting to learn about PDEs from Evans' text, and am only on Chapter 2 of Part I, which deals with the usual linear second order PDE.  I suspect the restriction of initial/boundary conditions to some $g$ with $0\leq g\leq1$ is probably fairly significant in simplifying the problem.  But even for this case, I am not sure how to attack the problem.  But is it reasonable to expect that one should know how to analyze the solutions to this PDE for arbitrary $g$? Some of the ways I tried to attack the problem included finding a simplifying substitution (for example, when $\alpha=1$ I was able to use $u=e^{t}v$ to eliminate the RHS term), but I could not think of any that would work for all $\alpha$.  Next I tried applying usual energy techniques, but this did not seem to lead anywhere fruitful (things like the arbitrariness of $\alpha$ and the non-periodic boundary conditions obstructed a clear path to making use any possible candidate for the energy functional). Next I wondered if solutions to the PDE itself (without any specified boundary conditions) satisfies a maximum principle.  But I found this hard to prove using straightforward techniques like $\epsilon$ regularization, and the methods Evans uses to prove the strong maximum principle for just the heat equation via time-dependent mean-value properties was already complicated enough as it was to even think about extending the arguments to the non-linear PDE above.  On the other hand, the non-linearity likely precludes this possibility, at least for all $\alpha$.  Furthermore, if for all $\alpha$ the equation did satisfy a weak maximum principle, then it would imply the answer is all $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, and this also seems unlikely.  Why it seems unlikely is related to my next thought in considering the ODE
$$u_{t}=u^{\alpha}.$$
For $t>0$ and $0\leq u(0)=g(\cdot,0)\leq1$, solutions to this ODE exhibit a wide variety of behavior depending on $\alpha$, and even lacks uniqueness in many cases.  But in general, either the solution blows up (e.g. $\alpha\geq2$), grows exponentially (e.g. $\alpha=1$), or else grows in some sort of algebraic fashion like $O(x^{\beta})$ (correct me if I am wrong, please!). The point of this breakdown into various classes of solutions to the above ODE is to somehow relate the behavior back to the behavior of solutions to the PDE with the diffusion term $\Delta u$ added back.  Heuristically, the diffusion term $\Delta u$ ""smoothes"" the solution and ""spreads"" it out over the spatial domain $U$ as $t>0$ progreses.  On the other hand, $u^{\alpha}$ heuristically causes growth in the solution in space as $t>0$ evolves.  If the growth term $u^{\alpha}$ overpowers the diffusion term $\Delta u$, then it seems the solution would not remain uniformly bounded in $t$, and if the growth term is very strong, then singularities could develop in finite time $t$.  Anyway, that is all fine (I think), but the practical question is how does one convert heuristics about the PDE into specific quantitative information/estimates about the solution (in this case, uniform $t$-boundedness of $u$ as a function of $\alpha$)? One last comment.  I haven't really considered (from a purely heuristic point of view) the boundary terms, and the special assumption $0\leq g\leq1$ (I would still like to know in any answer how we could generalize $g$ a bit more, if it can be reasonably done).  $U$ is of course bounded, so the diffusion of the system is constrained to a bounded region kept at some constant positive density on the boundary.  This would seem to me that the growth term inevitably dominates, since the solution will continuously grow and grow (as mass is added into the system restricted to a bounded region).  Whether the solution develops singularities would depend on the strength of the diffusion term.  If the diffusion term is strong enough, then the mass added to the system has enough time to spread out, whereas if it is too weak, then the concentration will spike into a singularity at some point(s) in $U$.  Either way, it would appear that unless $g(x,0)\equiv0$, the solution is at best not uniformly bounded, and at worst actually blows up in finite time $t<\infty.$  Maybe this answers the question?  If it helps, I was only asked to ""explain"" my answer, so given the non-linearity of the PDE itself, perhaps we aren't expected to provide a rigorous argument, though I would like to develop one if it is possible. Any hints are appreciated -- thanks! EDIT 1: I should clarify since I don't know if the terminology parabolic boundary/cylinder is standard.  $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (spatial region) and $$U_{T}:=U\times(0,T],$$ $$\Gamma_{T}:=\partial U\times[0,T]\cup U\times\{t=0\}=\overline{U_{T}}-U_{T}.$$ EDIT 2: For problems addressing behavior, such as boundedness, for large $t$, is it helpful to consider the time-independent case?  e.g. the elliptic PDE
$$-\Delta u=u^{\alpha}.$$
In other words, if the solution to this elliptic PDE (with appropriate boundary conditions as intimated by the original parabolic-type PDE) is bounded, could we somehow deduce boundedness (and hence uniform boundedness) for all $t$ before ""$t=\infty$?""  I guess the only obstruction to this would be the possibility of singularities developing and then evaporating over time, which doesn't seem likely (though I am not going to say it's impossible, since I have no mathematical justification for it, and also black holes can be thought of as ""singularities"" which evaporate over large periods of time as they radiate energy, this probably going way off topic).","['partial-differential-equations', 'analysis']"
314393,Differential Equation Setup for an RLC Circuit,"I'm getting confused on how to setup the following differential equation problem: You have a series circuit with a capacitor of $0.25*10^{-6}$ F, a resistor of $5*10^{3}$ ohms, and an inductor of 1H. A 12 volt battery is connected and is closed at $t=0$. I need to find the equation for the charge of the capacitor at time $t$. Based on the information given in the book I am using, I would think to setup the equation as follows: $LQ''+RQ'+\frac1cQ=E(t)$ $L$, the inductance, would be $1$ $R$ is resistance and is $5*10^3$ Finally, capitance is $C=0.25*10^{-6}$ $Q(t)$ would represent the charge of the capacitor at time $t$, which is the solution to my problem. The issue I am having is with the 12 volt battery that is connected. Normally, I would think to set $E(t)$ to 0 because $E(t)$ is the impressed voltage, but obviously with the battery, the impressed voltage would be 12 volts and not 0.

I have no idea how to do this. We did prove that the only regular functions on $\mathbb{P}^n$ are constant functions, using the method of reducing regular functions to locally regular functions, but that was the extent of it. Here's an example: Consider the Segre embedding $\varphi \colon \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Q$ be its image (i.e. $\{xw=yz\}$), let $p = (1:0:0:0)$, and let $H = \{x = 0\} = (\mathbb{A}_{(0)}^3)^c$. Define $\pi_p \colon Q \to H$ as the projection map from $p$ (i.e. given a point in $q \in Q$ join it with a line to $p$ and define $\pi_p(q)$ to be the point where that line intersects $H$). Prove that this map is rational. Then prove some other things (the other things are: $\pi_p$ maps the complement of the two lines $(a:0:b:0), (a:b:0:0)$ in $Q$ isomorphically to a copy of $\mathbb{A}^2$, and find the domain of $\pi_p$).

Let $k$ algebraically closed. Let $X$ be an irreducible quasiprojective variety. A function $f \colon X \to k$ is regular at $x \in X$ if $f = \frac{u}{v}$ in a neighborhood of $x$, and $f$ is regular if it is regular at every such $x$. A map $f \colon X \to \mathbb{A}^n$ is regular if each of its coordinate functions is regular. If $Y$ is another quasiprojective variety then $f \colon X \to Y$ is regular iff $f \colon X \to \mathbb{A}^n_{(i)}$ is regular iff $f \colon f^{-1}(\mathbb{A}^n_{(i)}) \to \mathbb{A}^n_{(i)}$ is regular, where $\mathbb{A}^n_{(i)} = \{ (x_0:...:x_n) \mid x_i \neq 0\}$.

314508,Weak holomorphicity implies smooth and holomorphic.,"This is an extension of a previously asked question: A function $f\in L^2(D)$ is weakly holomorphic if, for every $\phi\in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}_c(D)$, $$\int_D f\partial_{\bar{z}}\phi = 0.$$ I'm trying to show that each such $f$ is smooth on the interior of $D$ and is in fact a strong solution to $\partial_{\bar{z}}f=0$; i.e., $f$ is holomorphic in the usual sense. Here's what I've proven so far: Let $B$ be a bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f\in L^p(D)$ for $1<p<\infty$. Let $g$ be a smooth, non-negative function supported in the unit ball with Lebesgue integral 1 and consider the mollifier $$f_{\epsilon}(x)=\epsilon^{-n}\int_{B}g(\frac{x-y}{\epsilon})f(y)dy$$ where $x\in B$ and $\epsilon<|x,\partial B|$. Then, $f_{\epsilon}\rightarrow f$ uniformly in the $L^p$ sense as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. Consequently, $f$ can be approximated by smooth, compactly supported functions in $B$. Now, supposing this is true in the complex case if we just replace $B$ with the unit disk $D$ (I haven't proven this, but I think it's correct...) then I'm essentially done if I can demonstrate that my mollifying functions are holomorphic since I already know they're smooth. I'm not quite sure where the hypothesis would come into play, however. Anyway, is this the correct route? Thanks.","['partial-differential-equations', 'functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

There is a wonderful book on category theory containing such a proof: The Handbook of Categorical Algebra , Volume 2, by Francis Borceux. I have a question about the proof, however, which I can't seem to resolve. The Snake Lemma is Lemma 1.10.9, and I have a problem with one of the preliminaries: Namely, the ""restricted"" Snake Lemma 1.10.8. Edit: I scanned the diagrams in question from the book. The following is what we want, i.e. we want to construct $\omega$ from the rest of the diagram where all squares commute and all rows and columns are exact. The construction is then as follows: $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ are obtained by pull-back and we define $\Sigma:=\mathrm{Ker}(\Delta)$. Dually with $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Upsilon$. On page 46, he says that By lemma 1.10.1 and its dual, there are morphisms $\Psi$ and $\Omega$ making the diagram commutative and the outer columns exact. I can not verify this statement. For instance concerning $\Psi$, it seems to me that in order to apply lemma 1.10.1, one would require that the sequence $(\Gamma,\lambda)$ is exact, but I do not see how that would follow from the construction. What am I doing wrong?!

This is a $\sigma$-algebra. $\emptyset \in \mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2} \in \mathfrak{A}$ and if $A \in \mathfrak{A} $, $T(A)$ is Borel and so is also $T(A)^{C}$ = $T(A^{C})$ so $A^{C} \in \mathfrak{A}$. Finally, If $\cup_{i} T(A_{i})$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathfrak{A}$ then it is a union of borel sets and thus borel, since $\cup_{i} T(A_{i}) = T (\cup_{i} A_{i})$, then $\cup_{i} A_{i} \in \mathfrak{A}$ Since $\mathfrak{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra and T is continuous, $\mathfrak{A}$ contains all open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and so $\mathfrak{A}$ contains the Borel sigma algebra $\mathfrak{B(\mathbb{R^{2}})}$. So if A is Borel, then also $T(A)$ is Borel since $\mathfrak{B(\mathbb{R^{2}})} \subset \mathfrak{A}$.

I want to prove that circle $S^1=\{(x,y)\mid x^2+y^2=1 \}$ homeomorphic to $[0,1]/ 0\sim1$ (segment with the identified points). 
To solve this problem, I use the following theorem: If $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ is continuous and surjective map, $X$ is compact, $Y$ is Hausdorff then the map $f/S(f): X/S(f) \longrightarrow Y$ is homeomorphism. So if we assume the map $f: [0,1]\longrightarrow S^1$ by the rule $f(t)=(\cos(2\pi t),\sin(2\pi t))$. This map and spaces satisfy all the conditions of theorem. So $S^1\approx [0,1]/ 0\sim1$ But I think that the use of this theorem is not necessary here. Maybe you know any other ways to solve this problem. Edit:
A map $f : X \longrightarrow Y$ determines the partition of the set X into nonempty

314899,"Sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^n \times \mathbb{P}^m$, and a commutation relation for derived functors of global sections and tensor products on it.","I'll state my questions first and then provide some background. Question 3 is by far my most important one. We work over $k=\mathbb{C}$ whenever necessary. Is it true that $\text{Pic}(\mathbb{P}^n \times \mathbb{P}^m) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, with generators $\pi_1^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1))$ and $\pi_2^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^m}(1))$? (here the $\pi_i$ are the canonical projections). Is it true that the presheaf $U \mapsto  \pi_1^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(k_1))(U) \otimes  \pi_2^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^m}(k_2))(U)$ is already a sheaf for all $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$? If not, is this true if we demand the $k_i$ to be positive, or equal, or both? Let $F, G$ be line bundles on a projective variety $X$ such that their tensor product in presheaves is already a sheaf. Then of course $H^0(X, F \otimes G) \cong H^0(X,F) \otimes H^0(X,G)$, differently stated the global sections functor commutes with the tensor product (although the tensor products are ""different"", one is is (pre)sheaves and one is in $k$-vector spaces).
Question: Is there a similar relation for the higher sheaf cohomology functors commuting with the tensor product? I can imagine that there exists some spectral sequence for this, most probably also involving the higher Tor functors. Background: I am considering a singular surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and its desingularization in the blowup $S \subset \tilde{\mathbb{P}^3} \subset \mathbb{P}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^2$. I am considering some particular line bundle $Q$ on $S$ and am intensely interested in its first cohomology group. I have little information to work with, but after tensoring this sheaf with some other ""easy"" bundles its cohomology can be easily calculated. I am hoping i can translate this back to information about the bundle $Q$. My attempts so far: For 1., i am pretty sure Hartshorne II.6.6 and II.6.6.1 generalize directly but it feels slippery, which is why i ask. About 2, when thinking of 
$$
\mathbb{P}^n \times \mathbb{P}^m = \text{Proj}(k[z_{ij}]_{i,j})/\sim
$$
and Serre's construction of the twisting sheaves where the global sections are just elements of this ring of some degree, it seems to be true at least for global sections and $k_1 = k_2$. Again, it feels slippery enough to ask. As for 3 i have no idea (yet). Please feel free to use the language of schemes and homological algebra, i am supposed to be familiar with this..

314960,Definition of continuity at a point,"In ""Principles of mathematical analysis"" Walter Rudin gives the definition of $$\lim_{x \rightarrow p} f(x)=q$$ for $f: X \supset E \rightarrow Y$ with $X,Y$ metric spaces, in this way: for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta >0$ such that $$d_Y(f(x),q)<\epsilon$$ for all points $x \in E$ for which $$0<d_X(x,p)<\delta$$ where $d_X$ and $d_Y$ are the distances in $X$ and $Y$. After few pages he gives the definition of continuity: $f$ is said to be continuous at $p$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there
  exists a $\delta >0$ such that $$d_Y(f(x),f(p))<\epsilon$$ for all points $x \in E$ for which $$d_X(x,p)<\delta$$ My question is, why did he drop the $0<\dots$ in $d_X(x,p)<\delta$? I though that continuity in $p$ means that the limit of the function in $p$ exists and is equal to $f(p)$, so one should simply replace $q$ with $f(p)$ in the above definition of limit, why changing the condition on $x$? Doing so a function like $$f: \{1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ which maps 1 to 5, for example, would be continous in 1, since $x=p$ is allowed, but what is the limit of $f$ in 1? It doesn't exist, right? Is there a deep reason for such a counterintuitive definition? EDIT: Maybe I should better clarify my question. I know that this definition works, I am asking why considering a function continuos at isolated points (which is an immediate consequence of this defintion ---> It turned out I was wrong about this). The only reason I can think of is that this definition agrees with the topological one for continuity, but it doesn't seem to me a good reason since topology came after (and would have agreed no matter the convention).","['calculus', 'continuity']"
314966,Measure vs outer measure,"Basically I feel like I'm having a chicken before egg problem. An outer measure is a set function defined on some set X with the properties that empty returns 0, of sub additivity and of monotonicity.
From this outer measure we get a sigma algebra of measurable sets.
On this sigma algebra the outer measure is a measure with the property of additivity for unions of disjoint sets. But we can also define a measure , a set function, on an algebra of sets with the properties that empty returns zero and of additivity of unions of disjoint sets. Then via caratheodory construction we can make an outer measure from the measure for the whole set. So what comes first, or does neither come first? Note: that this all began with a sample final question that I'm still stuck on that asked ""if a measure is defined on the whole power set is it also an outer measure?"" Which is why I marked this as homework. Note 2: also is the answer to the question the following: Any measure can be transformed into an outer measure via caratheodory? Thanks.

The above approximation derives from the simple practical fact that each cell in the grid normally has direct access only to its immediate lateral neighbours. This simplifies the code. However, constraints on the grid resolution and time step, combined with sometimes-large viscosity and diffusion parameters, means the simulation sometimes behaves badly. I would like to try a better approximation of the diffuse term, considering diagonal neighbours and neighbours further than one grid step away.
