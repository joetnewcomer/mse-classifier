73060,Why are there no non-trivial regular maps $\mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^m$ when $n > m$?,"Question. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, an let $\mathbb{P}^n$ be projective $n$-space over $k$. Why is it true that every regular map $\mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^m$ is constant, when $n > m$? I can't see any obvious obstructions: there are certainly homomorphisms of function fields (giving rise to the dominant rational maps), and we're not demanding the map be injective or anything. While it is clear that $(F_0 : \cdots : F_m)$ cannot define a regular map on its own unless $F_0, \ldots, F_m$ are all constants, I don't see why it should be impossible to extend $(F_0 : \cdots : F_m)$ by choosing some other $(G_0 : \cdots  G_m)$ which agrees with $(F_0 : \cdots : F_m)$ on the intersection of their domains.

Since the definition of difference/equality of equivalence relations was not given, I thought that it should be based on the equivalence classes of such a relation.

73069,"Show $\{u_n\}$ orthonormal, A compact implies $\|Au_n\| \to 0$","I'm having a bit trouble with this homework exercise. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space and $\{u_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ an
  orthonormal sequence in $\mathcal{H}$. Let $A$ be a compact operator
  on $\mathcal{H}$. Show that $\|Au_n \| \to 0$ as $n\to \infty$. My book defines a compact operator as an operator $A$ such that whenever $f_n$ is bounded, then $Af_n$ has a convergent subsequence (equivalently, the image of $A$ is relatively compact). It seems I must somehow combine the fact that $Au_n$ has a convergent subsequence with the fact that $\{u_n\}$ is orthonormal. This is where I get stuck. Maybe I can somehow use the fact that $\|u_n-u_m \| = \sqrt{2}\, $  for $m \neq n$.","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
73071,A constrained topological sort?,"Suppose that one has a directed, acyclic graph G, and each vertex $v$ contains a (positive) value $a_v$.  Additionally, let $r$ be a constant.  For my purposes, $r>1$, but this might not matter.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices in G and let $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. A topological sort of $G$ is a bijection $G\to[n]$ such that if there is a path from $v$ to $w$, then $\tau(v)<\tau(w)$.  Alternately, if we view $G$ as defining a partial ordering, a topological sort is a total ordering extending the partial ordering. I would like to find $\displaystyle\min_{\tau} \sum_v a_v r^{\tau (v)}$, where we are taking the minimum over all topological sorts of G.  It may help to generalize the problem and to finding $\displaystyle\min_{\tau} \sum_v a_v p({\tau (v)})$, where $p:[n]\to \mathbb R$ is a penalty/weight function (perhaps assumed to take positive values and be monotonic). There are two extreme cases.  If $G$ has no edges, we would sort things in ascending or descending order depending on if $r<1$ or $r>1$.  If $G$ is already a linear order, there is nothing to be done.  Already, the problem seems nontrivial given two disjoint linear orderings, where the problem reduces to the optimal riffle shuffle. So is there a good algorithm for solving this?  I know of some heuristics which help in certain cases, and I can use a bubble-sort type algorithm to get ""local"" minima, but unless there is a way to recast the problem, I don't see a good way to solve it. Added later: I want to extend my comment and explain why I view dynamic programming to be insufficient.  At best, this will clarify what I'm looking for.  At worst, this will reveal a gap in my understanding which someone can clarify. For there to be a dynamic programming solution, there need to be sub-problems which can be built upon to get a larger solution.  For example, when searching for a path through a graph with edge lengths, if a minimal length path passes through a particular vertex, then the path from from the start to that vertex must be of minimal length.  If we keep track of all the vertices that can be reached in time less than $t$, then we can ignore all paths through those close vertices which do not begin with a minimal path, and so we need to remember at most one path to any vertex, and at every stage we only need to find the shortest path to an unvisited vertex which is an extension of a known minimal path.  This gives $O(n^2)$ storage costs and $O(nm)$ time costs where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges. The obvious sub-problem to use for the problem at hand is that, if we know an initial/terminal segment for an optimal solution, the restriction to the subgraph containing just those elements will yield the same initial/terminal segment.  It does not appear that we can say anything stronger.  The algorithm this yields is as follows: Select all vertices with no predecessors, and put each of these singletons into a list of admissible initial segments. (Definition) For an admissible initial segment of length $n$, we say that an extension of length $n+1$ is admissible if it satisfies both the topological constraints of the directed graph and, if no topologically allowed insertion of the new element has a lower total value.  From the collection of all admissible extensions of length $n+1$. Given the collection of all admissible segments of length $n$, form the collection of all admissible extensions of length $n+1$. From the collection generated in (3), if any two admissible extensions use exactly the same collection of vertices, remove the segment with a higher associated cost. Loop through (3) and (4) until you have found the minimal initial segment containing every vertex of the graph. If the penalty function is monotonic increasing (e.g., if $r>1$), we can improve run time somewhat by adding a heuristic (total cost of adding everything else at the minimum possible distance, ignoring that only one item can be in any particular spot), but even with this improvement, we have the following fundamental problem: The algorithm doesn't require checking every initial segment, but it does require examining every collection of vertices which could form an allowable initial segment.  In the worst case scenario, this is exponential in the number of vertices (though is significantly reduced when there are severe topological constraints).  Additionally, in the worst case scenario, the space requirements are on the order of $\binom{n}{n/2}$ where there are $n$ vertices. The dynamic programming algorithm is still quite an improvement over more naive algorithms, but I would like to find something that runs in polynomial time, or else show that such an algorithm cannot exist.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'directed-graphs']"

Applying limits we would get $$ \lim \limits_{x\to0} \ln y =\lim \limits_{x\to0} x \ln (\sin x)$$ $$ \Rightarrow \ln y = \lim \limits_{x\to0} x \times  \lim \limits_{x\to0} \ln (\sin x) $$ $$ \Rightarrow  \ln y = 0 \times \infty =0$$ $$ \Rightarrow  y = e^0  =1$$ Is my deduction correct here?

I notice right away that I can write $$A = \begin{bmatrix} B & I_{2} \\ 0_{22} & B \end{bmatrix}$$ where $$B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\ 1 &  1\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ I'm sort of making up a method here and I hope it works.

I write: $$A = \mathrm{diag}(B,B) + \begin{bmatrix}0_{22} & I_{2}\\ 0_{22} & 0_{22}\end{bmatrix}$$ Call $S = \mathrm{diag}(B,B)$ , and $N = \begin{bmatrix}0_{22} & I_{2}\\ 0_{22} & 0_{22}\end{bmatrix}$ . I note that $N^2$ is $0_{44}$ , so $$e^{N} = \frac{N^{0}}{0!} + \frac{N}{1!} + \frac{N^2}{2!} + \cdots = I_{4} + N + 0_{44} + \cdots = I_{4} + N$$ and that $e^{S} = \mathrm{diag}(e^{B}, e^{B})$ and compute: $$e^{A} = e^{S + N} = e^{S}e^{N} = \mathrm{diag}(e^{B}, e^{B})\cdot[I_{4}  + N]$$ This reduces the problem to finding $e^B$ , which is much easier.

Apparently this is supposed to be an easy question but I hit a brick wall at the following point.  Can anyone give me a tip or tell me if I'm going down the wrong road? My approach: Let $A$ be a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix, and then suppose $x$ is a real-valued column vector of dimension $n$ with not all entries equal to $0$.  I need to show that $x^Te^{A}x> 0$. (based on looking up the definition of positive definite on wikipedia) Then $\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{T}(e^{A})x &=& x^{T}(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{A^{n}}{n!})x\\
&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{T}A^{n}x}{n!}\\
&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{T}A^{n}x}{n!})\\

&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(x^{T}Ax)^{n}}{n!\|x\|^{2(n-1)}})\\
&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(x^{T}A^{T}x)^{n}}{n!\|x\|^{2(n-1)}}\\
&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{((Ax)^{T}x)^{n}}{n!\|x\|^{2(n-1)}}\\

&=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{((x^{T}Ax)^{T})^{n}}{n!\|x\|^{2(n-1)}}\\

choices of the candidates and then each voter votes for the candidate whose position is closest to
the voter’s ideological position. If the candidates choose $x_1$ = .3 and $x_2$ = .6, for instance, then any
voter to the left of 0.45 votes for candidate 1 and anyone to the right of 0.45 votes for candidate 2.
Therefore, candidate 1 gets 45% of votes and 2 gets 55% so the winner is candidate 2. If both candidates choose the same position, the votes are split equally, and the winner is chosen by ﬂipping
a fair coin. Suppose that the candidates care only about their chance of winning, and are not at
all interested in ideology Suppose there are three candidates. Show that in any pure strategy Nash equilibrium: (i)
there is a player who wins for sure, (ii) the winner’s position is the most left or the most
right among the three candidates, (iii) if the winner is in the most left, then the positions

Let $A$ be an additive subgroup of Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$, and assume that in every bounded region of space, there is only a finite number of elements of $A$. Show that $A$ is a free abelian group on $\leq n$ generators. [ Hint: Induction on the maximal number of linearly independent elements of $A$ over $\mathbb R$. Let $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ be a maximal set of such elements, and let $A_0$ be the subgroup of $A$ contained in the $\mathbb R$-space generated by $v_1, \ldots, v_{m-1}$. By induction, one may assume that any element of $A_0$ is a linear integral combination of $v_1, \ldots, v_{m-1}$. Let $S$ be the subset of elements $v \in A$ of the form $v= a_1 v_1 + \cdots + a_m v_m$ with real coefficients $a_i$ satisfying 
  $$
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 \leq a_i < 1, &\ \ \text{if } i=1,2,\ldots, m-1
\\
0 \leq a_m \leq 1 .&
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
  If $v'_m$ is an element of $S$ with the smallest $a_m \neq 0$, show that $\{ v_1, \ldots, v_{m-1}, v'_m \}$ is a basis of $A$ over $\mathbb Z$.] Following the hint, I suppose $c_1v_1+\cdots+c_{m-1}v_{m-1}+c_mv'_m=0$ for $c_i\in\mathbb{Z}$. Then
$$
c_1v_1+\cdots+c_{m-1}v_{m-1}+c_m(a_1v_1+\cdots+a_mv_m)=0
$$
implies
$$
(c_1+a_mc_1)v_1+\cdots+(c_{m-1}+c_ma_{m-1})v_{m-1}+c_ma_mv_m=0.
$$
But $v_1,\dots,v_m$ are linearly independent, so $c_ma_m=0$, thus $c_m=0$ since $a_m\neq 0$. Then since $c_i+c_ma_i=0$ for all other $i$, $c_i=0$ for $i=1,\dots,m-1$, and the vectors are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Z}$. I'm trying to show $\{v_1,\dots,v_{m-1},v'_m\}$ also span $A$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. Since $v_1,\dots,v_m$ is a maximal linearly independent set, I think I can write any $x\in A$ as
$$
x=c_1v_1+\cdots+c_mv_m,\quad c_i\in\mathbb{R}.
$$
I realized
$$
x=(\lfloor c_1\rfloor v_1+\cdots+\lfloor c_m\rfloor v_m)+(c'_1v_1+\cdots+c'_mv_m)
$$
where $\lfloor \cdot\rfloor$ is the floor function, and $0\leq c'_i<1$. So the second summand in parentheses is in $S$, and the first summand is a linear integral combination of $v_1,\dots,v_m$. I'm not sure if this observation leads anywhere, and I'm not sure where the fact that $A$ has only finitely many elements in every bounded region of space comes in. What's the right way to proceed? Thanks. Added: With Arturo Magidin's help, $ka_m=c'_m$ for some positive integer $k$. Thus
$$
x=(\lfloor c_1\rfloor v_1+\cdots+\lfloor c_m\rfloor v_m)+k((c'_1/k)v_1+\cdots+a_mv_m),
$$
so taking $v'_m=(c'_1/k)v_1+\cdots+a_mv_m$, $\{v_1,\dots,v_m,v'_m\}$ is a spanning set of $A$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. How can I show from this that $\{v_1,\dots,v_{m-1},v'_m\}$ spans $A$ over $\mathbb{Z}$?","['modules', 'linear-algebra']"

73227,"If $f,g$ are simple measurable functions, show that $f+g$ and $f\,g$ are too","This homework problem involves showing that if $f,g$ are measurable simple functions, then so is $f+g$ and $f\,g$ - without using: 1) $\{x \in A: (f+g)(x) < t\} = \bigcup_{r\in\mathbb{Q}} \left[ \{x\in A: f(x) < r\} \cap \{x \in A: g(x) < t-r\} \right]$, for $(X,\mathcal{A})$, $X \supseteq A \in \mathcal{A}$, $f,g$ are $[0,{}^+\infty]$-valued measurable functions on $A$. 2) using $f-g$ as $f+(-1)\,g$, or $f^2$ proofs whereby one uses the set $\{x\in A: f^2(x) < t \} = \{ x\in A: -\sqrt{t} < f(x) < \sqrt{t} \}$ (I hope this is clear!) So I believe (think) that a simple function is: $f := \sum_{k=1}^n\,a_k\,\chi_{E_k}$, where $E_k = f^{-1}(\{a_k\}) \in \mathcal{A}$ (though I don't think it has to belong to the algebra). I am supposed to show these claims without using the two enumerations above in two different ways, one using simple functions, and the other using: 3) $f \vee g := \max(f(x),g(x)) \leftrightarrow \{x \in A: (f \vee g)(x) \leq t\} = \{x \in A: f(x) \leq t\} \cap \{x \in A: g(x) \leq t \}$ 4) $f \wedge g \cdots \{ \} = \{ \} \cup \{ \}$ 5) This theorem claims: $(X,\mathcal{A})$ - measurable space, $X \supseteq A \in \mathcal{A}$, $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of $[{}^-\infty,{}^+\infty]$-valued measurable functions on $A$. Then (a) functions $\sup_n f_n$ and $\inf_n f_n$ are measurable, (b) $\limsup_n f_n$ and $\liminf_n f_n$ are measurable, and (c) $\lim_n f_n$ is measurable, with a domain where $\limsup_n f_n = \liminf_n f_n$ 6) The sets $A_{n,k} = \{x \in A: \frac{k-1}{2^n} \leq f(x) < \frac{k}{2^n} \}$, which is like a scaled (to $n$) `largest integer function' that is more and more refined with increasing $n$ These are utilized in the claim: $(X,\mathcal{A})$ - measurable space, $X \supseteq A \in \mathcal{A}$, and $f$ be a $[0,+\infty]$-valued measurable function on $A$. Then there is a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of $[0,+\infty]$-valued simple measurable functions on $A$ that satisfy (1) $f_1(x) \leq f_2(x) \leq \cdots$ and (2) $f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)$, at each $x \in A$.

According to Papoulis , the conditional distribution function $F_{X|Y} = P(X \leq x | Y = y)$ is defined by considering the probability $P(X \leq x | y \leq Y \leq y + \delta y)$ and taking the limit $\delta y\to 0$. However, I do not find the derivation given there rigorous. It is easy to write: $$P(X \leq x | y \leq Y \leq y + \delta y) = \frac{P( X \leq x, y \leq Y \leq y + \delta y)}{P(y \leq Y \leq y + \delta y)} = \frac{F_{X,Y}(x,y+\delta y) - F_{X,Y}(x,y)}{F_Y(y+\delta y) - F_Y(y)}$$ from definition of $F_{X,Y}$, $F_Y$ and the fact that the point probabilities are zero.

Any help is much appreciated. EDIT: Papoulis obtains a formula for the density function by differentiating the term inside the limit. i.e., 
$$ f_{X|Y}(x,y) =  \lim_{\delta y \to 0} \left(\frac{\partial F_{X,Y}(x,y+\delta y) - F_{X,Y}(x,y)}{\partial x}\frac{1}{F_Y(y+\delta y) - F_Y(y)}\right)$$ I believe I should have asked for the derivation of the density function as I am afraid that the Conditional Distribution functions does not have a neat expression.

73723,Proposition used in the definition of the Lebesgue Integral,"I am having a hard time understanding one direction of the proof of the following proposition: Let $f$ be a bounded function on a measurable set $E$ with $m(E) \lt \infty$. Then $f$ is measurable if and only if $$\inf_{f\leq\psi}\int\psi(x)\;\text{d}x=\sup_{f\geq\phi}\int\phi(x)\;\text{d}x ~,$$ 
where $\psi$ and $\phi$ are measurable simple functions. The proof certainly can be found in most books. I understand $(\Rightarrow)$ direction of the proof. However, I'm having a hard time understanding the proof of $(\Leftarrow)$ direction. That is, using the displayed equation to show that $f$ is measurable. I hope, someone will help make things clearer. Thanks.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

73733,The Power of Taylor Series,"I am teaching a Calculus class and we are finishing up power/Taylor series this week.  The last section of the chapter is on applications, but the only ones listed there are approximating non-rational numbers like $\sqrt{1.02}$ and computing limits like $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}$.  I would like to find better examples that may or may not have a quick physical application (I cannot assume they know any physics beyond what I can explain).  So, my question is, do any of you know some applications of Taylor series that I could spend maybe about half an hour to forty five minutes doing?  They needn't be physical applications, just interesting.  I have already done Euler's formula.  Also, we do not deal with any remainder theorems in this class.  Thanks.","['power-series', 'education', 'calculus']"
73750,Find the function given the equation $(g \circ f)(x) = x + 5$,"Let $g(x) = 4x + 1$. Find $f(x)$, given that the equation $(g \circ f)(x) = x + 5$ is true for all values of $x$. From my text, it looks like this would be expressed as $g[f(x)]$, but I don't see how you can determine the definition of $f(x)$. Do I need to assume a value of x and work backwards through the problem?",['algebra-precalculus']
73753,differentiability and continuity,"I have a question which is quite ""candid"" and for which I can hardly formalize properly every concepts but nonetheless, I was wondering if there were some topoligical and/or algebraic structure properties over spaces (to be defined) that make the set of continuous functions and the set of differentiable functions the same. Maybe this is simply impossible or only for trivial examples. Best regards PS : Motivation is simple curiosity","['general-topology', 'soft-question']"
73754,Subgroups of $S_4$ isomorphic to $S_3$ and $S_2$?,"It's a home work problem I got:
Find $4$ different subgroups of $S_4$ isomorphic to $S_3$ and $9$ isomorphic to $S_2$. My approach is: since $S_3=\{1, (123),(132),(12),(23),(13)\}$, just take the groups of permutations on $\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\}$, obviously they are all subgroups of $S_4$. To find the isomorphism, for each subgroup, just assign 1 to the first element, 2 to the second, 3 to the third. This is going to be an isomorphism. For example, in the group of permutations on $\{1,2,4\}$, assign $(124)\rightarrow(123) (24)\rightarrow(23),(142)\rightarrow(132), (14)\rightarrow(13)$, etc. I think this method is fine, but I have trouble with the second part of the problem. That is, to find the $9$ different subgroups of $S_4$ isomorphic to $S_2$. When I pick $2$ elements out of $\{1,2,3,4\}$, there can only be $\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways, which means this method only gives $6$ different subgroups isomorphic to $S_2$, but the problem says there are $9$. Is my method wrong? Or are there some other subgroups that I've missed? Thanks!!!","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
73758,Probability of $n$ successes in a row at the $k$-th Bernoulli trial... geometric?,"If one has Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$, then it makes sense that the probability of the first success observed to be at trial number $k$ be given by $$(1-p)^{k-1} p.$$ But how would we approach the same problem if the probability we are after is the probability of getting the first occurrence of two successes in a row at the $k$-th trial? In other words, for trial $k$ to be a success, with trial $k-1$ being a success and with no other occurrence of two successes in a row before that? In general what if we want the first $n$ successes in a row? I can do this with some counting if $p = 1/2$ but my counting argument (a requirement on the sequence of first $k-3$ trials, plus enforcing failure on the $k-2$ and then enforcing two successes in a row) breaks down if $p \neq 1/2$.  This shouldn't be too hard as it seems very similar in nature to the geometric distribution. Thanks.","['probability-distributions', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
