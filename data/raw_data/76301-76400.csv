958317,Convergence in equivalent probability measure,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space and $A_n$ be a sequence of events such that $P(A_n)$ converge to 0. If $Q$ is an equivalent probability measure of $P$, does it mean that $Q(A_n)$ also converge to 0? Can you please provide proof or counter example for it.

958321,Matrix exponentiation intuition.,"What does $x^A$ intuitively mean if $x \in \mathbb{C}$ and $A$ is any matrix? Also, what if we had $x$ being a matrix too? Last but not least, what happens if we have a complex $x$ raised to a quaternion(answering the first question probably generalizes this, but I include it in case only this case makes sense)? What does $x^a, x \in \mathbb{C}, a \in \mathbb{H}$ intuitively mean? What if $x \in \mathbb{H}$ too? I know that matrix exponentiation with base $e$ is $e^A=\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!} A^k$ but apart from symbols in a ""paper"", I see nothing else.","['matrices', 'quaternions', 'intuition', 'soft-question']"

958392,Prove that two groups of functions are isomorphic,"The two functions $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $g(x)=\frac{x-1}{x}$ generate, with the operation of function composition, a group $G$ of functions. Prove that this group is isomorphic to the group $S_3$. I found a solution which is pretty tedious, so I wonder if there are other ways to prove the above statement. So here is my solution: With composition we can generate the functions: $f(f(x))=x$, $g(g(x))=\frac{1}{1-x}$, $g(f(x))=1-x$ and $f(g(x))=\frac{x}{x-1}$ To prove that no more functions can be generated by using the functions above, we need to make a table ($*$ denotes function composition):
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
* & x & 1-x & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} \\
\hline
x & x & 1-x & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} \\
\hline
1-x & 1-x & x & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} \\
\hline
\frac{1}{x} & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} & x & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} & 1-x \\
\hline
\frac{x}{x-1} & \frac{x}{x-1} & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} & x & 1-x & \frac{1}{x} \\
\hline
\frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{x-1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} & 1-x & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{1}{1-x} & x \\
\hline
\frac{1}{1-x} & \frac{1}{1-x} & \frac{1}{x} & \frac{x}{x-1} & 1-x & x & \frac{x-1}{x}
\end{array}
$$ Hence no more functions can be generated. After some construction work, it seems that the following function is an isomorphism:
$$
\phi(x)=()
$$
$$
\phi(1-x)=(1,2)
$$
$$
\phi(\frac{1}{x})=(1,3)
$$
$$
\phi(\frac{x}{x-1})=(2,3)
$$
$$
\phi(\frac{x-1}{x})=(1,2,3)
$$
$$
\phi(\frac{1}{1-x})=(1,3,2)
$$ To check wether this is an isomorphism or not, we need to make a similar table with $S_3$:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
* & () & (1,2) & (1,3) & (2,3) & (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\
\hline
() & () & (1,2) & (1,3) & (2,3) & (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\
\hline
(1,2) & (1,2) & () & (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) & (1,3) & (2,3) \\
\hline
(1,3) & (1,3) & (1,3,2) & () & (1,2,3) & (2,3) & (1,2) \\
\hline
(2,3) & (2,3) & (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) & () & (1,2) & (1,3) \\
\hline
(1,2,3) & (1,2,3) & (2,3) & (1,2) & (1,3) & (1,3,2) & () \\
\hline
(1,3,2) & (1,3,2) & (1,3) & (2,3) & (1,2) & () & (1,2,3)
\end{array}
$$
If we express this table in terms of $\phi$ we get:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
* & \phi(x) & \phi(1-x) & \phi(\frac{1}{x}) & \phi(\frac{x}{x-1}) & \phi(\frac{x-1}{x}) & \phi(\frac{1}{1-x}) \\

\end{array}
$$ If we compare it to the first table we see that $\phi(f*g)=\phi(f)*\phi(g)$ $\forall f,g \in G$. Since $\phi$ is bijective it's an isomorphism. And therefore, $G$ and $S_3$ are isomorphic. Is there a way to avoid making those tables? It seems pretty intuitive after trial and error that $\phi$ is an isomorphism, but how can we prove it formally in a neat and elegant way?

958395,Maximizing curious symmetric function from simple combinatorics,"A curious symmetric function crossed my way in some quantum mechanics calculations, and I'm interested its maximum value (for which I do have a conjecture). (This question has been posted at MathOverflow on 13.12.2014; the question has been solved in a very nice way there.) The problem There are $n$ different objects $A_1,...,A_n$, and there are sets containing $m$ different $A_i$s: $C_i=(A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ..., A_{i_m})$. There are $i_{max}=\binom{n}{m}$ different combinations $C_i$. Each combination $C_i$ has a probability $p_i$ (with $\sum_{i=1}^{i_{max}} p_i=1$). Defining the function For a given pair of objects $A_k$ and $A_l$: $f_1(k,l)$ contains all probabilities $p_i$ of the sets $C_i$, which contains both objects $A_k$ and $A_l$. $f_2(k,l)$ contains all probabilities $p_i$ of the sets $C_i$, which contains either object $A_k$ or $A_l$ (if it contains both elements, we add $p_i$ twice). $F(k,l)=\frac{f_1(k,l)}{f_2(k,l)}$ With that, we get the main-function
$$D^{(n,m)}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \sum_{l=k+1}^{n} F(k,l)$$ What is the maximum of $D^{(n,m)}$, given that the sum of all probabilities $p_i$ is 1? Special cases n=2, m=2 This is a trivial case. We have two objects $A_1$ and $A_2$, and only one set of combinations $C_1=(A_1,A_2)$ with $p_1$. Thus $f_1(1,2)=p_1$, $f_2(1,2)=p_1+p_1$. This leads to $D^{(2,2)}=F(1,2)=\frac{1}{2}$. Every other case with $n=m$ can be solved easily by $D^{(n,m)}=\frac{1}{n}$ n=3, m=2 This case is simple (but not trivial) and I found a solution: We have n=3 objects $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$, and combinations $C_i$ of m=2 objects $C_1$=($A_1$, $A_2$), $C_2$=($A_1$, $A_3$), $C_3$=($A_2$, $A_3$), with $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$ respectivly. For k=1, l=2 we have $f_1(1,2)=p_1$ (because only $C_1$ contains both $A_1$ and $A_2$), and $f_2(1,2)=2p_1+p_2+p_3$ (because $A_1$ is contained in $C_1$ and $C_2$ and $A_2$ is in $C_1$ and $C_3$). So we get
$$D^{(3,2)}=F(1,2) + F(1,3) + F(2,3) = \frac{p_1}{2p_1+p_2+p_3} + \frac{p_2}{p_1+2p_2+p_3} + \frac{p_3}{p_1+p_2+2p_3}$$
A maximum can be found easily (due to normalisation of $p_1+p_2+p_3=1$):
$$D^{(3,2)} = \frac{p_1}{1+p_1} + \frac{p_2}{1+p_2} + \frac{p_3}{1+p_3}$$ so each term can be maximized individually, which gives $D^{(3,2)}=\frac{3}{4}$ for $p_1=p_2=p_3$. n=4, m=2 We have four objects $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, and six combinations $C_1=(A_1,A_2)$, $C_2=(A_1,A_3)$, ..., $C_6=(A_3, A_4)$. Therefore we get:
$$D^{(4,2)} = \frac{p_1}{2p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5} + \frac{p_2}{p_1+2p_2+p_3+p_4+p_6} + \frac{p_3}{p_1+p_2+3p_3+p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_4}{p_1+p_2+2p_4+p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_5}{p_1+p_3+p_4+2p_5+p_6} + \frac{p_6}{p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5+2p_6}$$ I was not able to find a method for proving a global maximum. n=4, m=3 We have $C_1=(A_1,A_2,A_3)$, $C_2=(A_1,A_2,A_4)$, $C_3=(A_1,A_3,A_4)$, $C_4=(A_2,A_3,A_4)$, which gives $$D^{(4,3)}=\frac{p_1+p_2}{2p_1+2p_2+p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_1+p_3}{2p_1+p_2+2p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_1+p_4}{2p_1+p_2+p_3+2p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_3}{p_1+2p_2+2p_3+p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_4}{p_1+2p_2+p_3+2p_4}+\frac{p_3+p_4}{p_1+p_2+2p_3+2p_4}$$ This case can be simplified aswell, similar to $n=3,m=2$ case to
$$D^{(4,3)}=\frac{p_1+p_2}{1+p_1+p_2}+\frac{p_1+p_3}{1+p_1+p_3}+\frac{p_1+p_4}{1+p_1+p_4}+\frac{p_2+p_3}{1+p_2+p_3}+\frac{p_2+p_4}{1+p_2+p_4}+\frac{p_3+p_4}{1+p_3+p_4}$$ but I'm not able to find any further method to calculate the maximum. Conjecture The two cases I solved had a maximum at equal $p_i=\frac{1}{\binom{n}{m}}$. Furthermore, the function $D^{(n,m)}$ is very symmetric, so I expect that the maximum is always at $p_1=p_2=...=p_i$. Numerical search up to n=7 confirms my expectation (but I'm not 100% sure about my Mathematica-based numerical maximization). Questions How can you prove (or disprove) that the maximum for $D^{(n,m)}$ for arbitrary $n$ and $m$ is always at $p_1=p_2=...=p_i$? Is there literature on similar problems or is this function even known? Has the similarity to the Shapiro inequality some significance or is it just a coincidence? Is there a better (maybe geometrical) interpretation of this function? Can you find solutions for any other special case than $n=m$ (always trivial) and $n=3,m=2$?","['nonlinear-optimization', 'inequality', 'functions', 'combinatorics']"

958453,ODE Guidance Needed,"This isn't from any homework assignment. I'm just trying to find the solution (either explicit or implicit) for this ODE. $$(x+2y)\,dx + (y)\,dy = 0$$ The first obvious step to take is to check if this is exact, and if not, find an integrating factor $\mu(x,y)$ such that it will become one when multiplied by the function $\mu$. It isn't exact (can be quickly checked), so here's what I did. Multiply by $\mu$ and assume that the equation is then exact: $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\mu(x,y)(x+2y))= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\mu(x,y)(y)) $$ $$ \mu_y(x,y)(x+2y) + 2\mu(x,y) = \mu_x(x,y)y $$ Now we assume that $\mu(x,y)$ is either an equation of only $x$ or only $y$. If we assume the former, we will inevitably end up with $\mu'$ multiplied by $y$, and so the solution ($\mu$(x)) would have to have a $y$ in it, which would contradict our original assumption. If we go with the latter ($\mu = \mu(y)$), then it's clear that we would end up with the same problem/contradiction. Thus, our integrating function/factor $\mu = \mu(x,y)$, but now that would be out of the scope of ordinary differential equations. In addition to that, whenever I try to make some nifty substitution to simplify this and end up with an explicit solution, it never works. Could you give me some guidance please? P.S: Don't just give me the solution (either implicit or explicit). I can easily get that on Wolframalpha","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"

958471,Lindelöf's Covering Theorem,"If $A \in \mathbb R^n$ and $F$ be an open covering of $A$. Then there is a countable subcollection of $F$ which also covers $A$. Proof: Let $G=\{A_1,A_2, \cdots\}$ denote the countable collection of all $n-$balls having rational centers and rational radii. this set $G$ will be used to help us extract a countable subcollection of $F$ which covers $A$. Assume $x \in A$. Then there is an open set $S \in F$ such that $x \in S \implies $ there's an $n-$ ball $A_k$ in $G$ such that $x \in A_k \subseteq S$. There are infinitely many $A_k$ but we choose the one with the minimum index , say $m = m(x)$. Then, we have $ x\in A_{m(x)} \subseteq S$. The set of all $n-$ balls $A_{m(x)}$ obtained as $x$ varies over all elements of $A$ is a countable collection of open sets which covers $A$. To get a countable subcollection of open sets which cover $A$, we simply correlate to each set $A_{k(x)}$ one of the sets $S$ of $F$ which contained $A_{k(x)}.$ This completes the proof. $(a)$ I have trouble understanding the last lines of the proof shown in the blue box. What does it mean actually? $(b)$There can be many $A_{k(x)}$ in  $S$. where $S$ is an open set in the collection $F$.

958492,Is the limit of the dual spaces the dual space of the limit?,"Note: Whenever I say ""dual space"" in this question, I mean the algebraic dual space. Consider an infinite-dimensional vector space $V$. Since it is infinite-dimensional, its double-dual $V^{**}$ is strictly larger than $V$. On the other hand, there's a natural injection $\iota:V\to V^{**}$, so by identifying $v$ with $\iota(v)$, we get $V\subsetneq V^{**}$. Of course $V^{**}$ again is an infinite dimensional vector space, so taking its double-dual gives again a larger vector space. So if we define
$$V_0=V, V_{n+1}=V_n^{**}$$
and do the identification as above, we get an infinite sequence of vector spaces
$$V_0\subsetneq V_1\subsetneq V_2\subsetneq\dots$$
We can now define the limit space as
$$V_\infty = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty V_n$$
It is not hard to verify that this is also a vector space: For every finite set of vectors in $V_\infty$ you find a $V_n$ which contains all of them, and thus also their linear combination, which therefore also is in $V_\infty$. Now obviously also for the dual spaces we have that $V_{n+1}^*$ is the double dual of $V_n^*$, therefore we can also define the limit space of the duals:
$$W_\infty = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty V_n^*$$ Now my question is: Is $W_\infty=V_\infty^*$? It seems intuitive that it should be, but on the other hand, each $V_n$ (except for $V_0$) is also the dual of $V_{n-1}^*$, and thus the same intuition gives that $V_\infty=W_\infty^*$. But both together cannot hold, since otherwise the double-dual of $V_\infty$ would be again $V_\infty$, which cannot be since $V_\infty$ is infinite-dimensional. So clearly the intuition doesn't help here. Indeed, that argument seems to indicate that both are not the same; however I can't see how to make that rigorous. Now clearly $W_\infty\subseteq V_\infty^*$, so assuming they are not equal, is it possible to explicitly construct an element of $V_\infty^*\setminus W_\infty$?",['linear-algebra']

958774,"Fundamental theorem of calculus for complex analysis, proof","I've been trying to verify/fill in the details of my book's proof of the complex FTOC, but have gotten stuck. Here are the statement and proof: If a continuous function $f$ has a primitive $F$ in $\Omega$, and $\gamma$ is a curve in $\Omega$ that begins at $w_{1}$ and ends at $w_{2}$, then $\int_{\gamma}f(z)dz = F(w_{2}) - F(w_{1})$. Here, a primitive for $f$ on $\Omega$ is a function $F$ that is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and such that $F'(z)=f(z)$ for all $z\in \Omega$, where that derivative is meant to be the complex derivative. Also, $\gamma$ being smooth means that any of its parametrizations $z:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is continuously differentiable. Proof: Suppose we have such a parametrization, and $z(a)=w_{1},z(b)=w_{2}$. then using the chain rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus,
\begin{align*}
\int_{\gamma}f(z)\,dz &= \int_{a}^{b}f(z(t))z'(t)\,dt \\
&= \int_{a}^{b}F'(z(t))z'(t)\,dt \\
&= \int_{a}^{b}\frac{d}{dt}F(z(t))\,dt \\
&= F(z(b)) - F(z(a))
\end{align*} I'm having trouble with the 3rd and 4th equalities in the above string. First, $F'$ means the complex derivative. We had a theorem earlier that said for any function $g:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic at some $z_{0}$, $g'(z_{0})=\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}(z_{0})$, where we defined the operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac12\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$. Let $m,n$ be the component functions of $z$, i.e. $m,n:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $z(t)=m(t)+i n(t)$ for all $t\in [a,b]$. Similarly, let $U,V:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ denote the component functions of $F$. Then 
\begin{align*}
F'(z(t))z'(t)
&= \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}(z(t))
   \left[\frac{d}{dt}m(t) + i\frac{d}{dt}n(t)\right] \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(z(t)) 
                    - i\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(z(t))\right]
   \left[\frac{d}{dt}m(t) + i\frac{d}{dt}n(t)\right] \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\left[\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} 
                          + \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right]
   +i\left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} 
           + \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right]\right)
   \left[\frac{d}{dt}m(t) + i\frac{d}{dt}n(t)\right]
\end{align*}
On the other hand, I'm not sure how to compute $\frac{d}{dt}F(z(t))$ using the chain rule. I'd be able to do it if I considered $F$ as a function from $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. I've tried guessing that the notational convention is 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}F(z(t)) &= \frac{d}{dt}U(z(t)) + i \frac{d}{dt} V(z(t))
\end{align*}
where $U(z(t)),V(z(t))$ are to be computed using the multivariable(real) chain rule, but that gave me something different from what I got for $F'(z(t))z'(t)$ above. For the fourth equality, where the FTOC is supposed to be used, I'm not sure how to parse it. The FTOC that I know is for functions $:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Question: Harold Davenport helped Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in writing down the explicit formula of $L(E,1)$ by Weierstrass $P$-functions, in which the factors of torsion group and real period naturally emerge. They succeeded in finding out: ""after the junk factors had been scrapped off""(i.e., Tamagawa numbers, cardinal of torsion group, real period), the value $L(E,1)$ is some integer equal to the order of Tate-Shafarevich group. Why did they believe that the integer is the order of some group whose calculation is intangible today ? I read the notes on elliptic curves by B and S-D, and I can hardly find a word about the canonical height and regulator of elliptic curves.

958867,When is the next palindrome?,"Okay, this is more just for fun than anything else. I'm driving in my car today, (true story) and my odometer is about to hit $81,818$.  So, being a math nerd and all, I immediately see the pattern and think palindrome... Then my eye hits the trip meter (the one that has the tenths of miles) and it is hovering at $3,241.1$ and I realize that I am going to have both number become palindromes together!  And so a few minutes goes by and sure enough, I have two palindromes on my odometer
$$81,818 \text{ and } 3,242.3$$
Being a math student, my mind immediately thinks ""I wonder when this will happen again?""  So, when is the next time this is going to happen again? So because the rate of change is slower for the odometer number, it really depends on that.  I also figure each unit of increase in the odometer number corresponds to 10 different consecutive tenths in the trip meter (for example if my odometer reading changes to 81,818 when the trip meter reads 3,241.6, the odometer will change to 81,819 when the trip meter reads 3,242.6). So, the next palindrome for the larger odometer is $81,918$ which means 100 miles has passed.  Therefore the trip reading is $3,341.6$ and it is easy to see that the trip meter will not hit $3,343.3$ before the larger number changes and I don't have a match. The next palindrome is $82,028$ and my smaller will read $3,452.3$ and thus I will not have a match. Question 1:  When is the next palindrome match on my odometer? Question 2:  Is there a way to generalize this?  For example, if I have a number $ab,cba$ which is a decimal representation whose last digit is the ones digit, and another number $z,yxy.x$, again another decimal representation with the last x being the tenths digit, is there a way to always find the next palindromic match?

I know that the IFT for manifolds says that if $df_p\colon T_pM\to T_{f(p)}N$ is invertible, then there exist connected nhbds $U\ni p$ and $V\ni f(p)$ such that $f|U\colon U\to V$ is a diffeomorphism. I don't see how we can apply it if $df_e$ is just known to be surjective.","['lie-groups', 'abstract-algebra']"

    x,              & \text{otherwise}

Now $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(\frac{1}{n})-f(0)}{\frac{1}{n}}=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(\frac{1}{n})}{\frac{1}{n}}=0$$ where as $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(-\frac{1}{n})-f(0)}{-\frac{1}{n}}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{f(-\frac{1}{n})}{-\frac{1}{n}}=1$$ What I am showing here is that the left hand derivative and the right hand derivative are not equal.
Can this be generalized as :  If  there exists two sequences $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ such that $\{x_n\} \to a$ and $\{y_n\} \to a$, $$f'(a)=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(x_n)-f(a)}{x_n-a}\ne \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(y_n)-f(a)}{y_n-a}=f'(a)$$, then $f$ is not differentiable at $a$??
