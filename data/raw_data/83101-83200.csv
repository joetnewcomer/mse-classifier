1085050,Measure Theory - Folland - Problem 2.7,"This is a problem from Real Analysis - Modern Techniques and Their Applications, by Folland. I'm trying my best here, but it's hard to solve. PS: The measurable space is $(X,\mathcal{M})$ . To me, the function should be $f(x) = \inf\{\alpha: x\in E_\alpha \} = \sup\{\alpha: x\in E_\alpha^c \}$ . I'm not entirely sure about this last equality, but I guess it's ok (I would prove this for last if all goes well, which is not the case). Anyway, the point is that $E_\alpha \subset f^{-1}((-\infty, \alpha])$ , for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ . My hope was to prove that $f^{-1}((-\infty, \alpha])\backslash E_\alpha = \emptyset$ , therefore $f^{-1}((-\infty, \alpha]) = E_\alpha \in \mathcal{M}$ . But this is not necessarily true because it's possible to have points $x\in E_\alpha^c$ such that $f(x) = \alpha$ . In addition to this problem, my idea is not using exercise 4, given below. I need to know how to fix this or what is the correct solution, if mine is wrong. Thanks a lot!",['measure-theory']
1085061,Is there a natural ring structure on $\operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{CP}^1)$?,"The set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on a complex manifold $X$ is a group under tensor product. This group is called the Picard group and is denoted $\operatorname{Pic}(X)$. We obtain the isomorphism $\operatorname{Pic}(X) \cong H^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*)$ by considering transition functions. By looking at the long exact cohomology sequence associated to the exponential sequence of sheaves we obtain $$\dots \to H^1(X, \mathcal{O}) \to H^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*) \xrightarrow{c_1} H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}) \to H^2(X, \mathcal{O}) \to \dots$$ By Dolbeault's Theorem, $H^k(X, \mathcal{O}) \cong H^{0,k}_{\bar{\partial}}(X)$. So, if $H^{0,1}_{\bar{\partial}}(X) = 0$, the map $c_1 : \operatorname{Pic}(X) \to H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is injective, $H^{0,2}_{\bar{\partial}}(X) = 0$, the map $c_1 : \operatorname{Pic}(X) \to H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is surjective. In the case of $X = \mathbb{CP}^1$, both conditions are met so $\operatorname{Pic}(X) \cong H^2(\mathbb{CP}^1, \mathbb{Z})$. Furthermore, $H^2(\mathbb{CP}^1, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ so $\operatorname{Pic}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$; this isomorphism is given by the degree of a line bundle. In addition to being a group, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring. Is there a natural ring structure on $\operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{CP}^1)$ such that the isomorphism between $\operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{CP}^1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ becomes an isomorphism of rings?","['vector-bundles', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'k-theory', 'riemann-surfaces']"
1085069,"If $f(x) \to 0$ and $g$ is a bounded function, then $f(x)g(x) \to 0$","I am using a non-English source text so I am not sure that all technical terms is given their correct English name. What my source text calls ""upper limited function"" is defined as a function that has an upper limited range, that is, there is a B such that $\forall x \in D_{f}: f(x) \leq B$ Question 1 : What is the correct English name for this term? I came across the following theorem: If $\lim f(x) = 0$ and the function $g(x)$ is limited (i.e. both ""upper limited"" and ""lower limited""), then $f(x)g(x) \rightarrow 0$ Question 2 : Is there a specific name for this theorem? The proof of this theorem starts by stating that the requirement that g(x) is limited for large x implies that there exists numbers $C$ and $\omega_{0}$, such that: $$x > \omega_{0} \rightarrow | g(x)| < C $$ Then they define $ \epsilon $ as a positive number and the assumptions behind $f(x)$ means that there is a number $\omega_{1}$, such that $$x > \omega_{1} \rightarrow | f(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{C} $$ Now, if $\omega = \max(\omega_{0},\omega_{1})$, then $$x > \omega \rightarrow |f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)||g(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{C} \cdot C = \epsilon$$ This apparently means exactly that $f(x)g(x) \rightarrow 0$ when $x \rightarrow \infty$ Question 3 : I do not really understand that much of this proof, such as the the part about assumptions behind $f(x)$ implies the things it does or how the part about $\omega = \max(\omega_{0},\omega_{1})$ follows. Any tips? Question 4 : I sometimes find myself dealing with non-English source texts for a variety of reasons.

1085080,What is the dense subset in $H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$,"I came across this problem when I try to prove that for space $H(\Omega):=H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is open bounded with nice boundary, then the norm $\|u\|_1:=\|\Delta u\|_{L^2}$ is equivalent to the norm $\|u\|_{H^2}$ in the usual sense. This problem can be proved by using open mapping theorem and showing that $\|u\|_1$ is actually make $H$ as a Banach space. However, I was thinking by using the fact that the norm $\|u\|_2:=\|u\|_{L^2}+\|D^2u\|_{L^2}$ is already an equivalent norm of $\|u\|_{H^2}$ and the term $\|u\|_{L^2}$ will be taken care by Poincare. Then I only need to show that $\|D^2u\|_{L^2(\Omega)}\leq C\|\Delta u\|_{L^2(\Omega)}$ for some constant $C$. I remembered when I deal with the weak solution of Biharmonic functions, I proved that 
$$ \int_\Omega \partial_i\partial_j u\cdot \partial_i\partial_j u\,dx=\int_\Omega \partial_i\partial_i u\cdot \partial_j\partial_j u\,dx \tag 1$$
by using density argument. So here I was going to use the same approach. But I can not see what function is dense in $H$ under $H^2$ norm. I don't think $C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ will work here because it will give us $H_0^2$ but not $H$. But we can not use $C^\infty(\bar \Omega)$ neither because we will lose $H_0^1$. So, what function should I use as the approximate function here? i.e., can I somehow use smooth function to approx $u\in H$ under $H^2$ norm? Update This question has been solved but I want to update that we can generalize this to $H^{2k}(\Omega)\cap H_0^k(\Omega)$. That is, the space $H^{2k}(\Omega)\cap H_0^k(\Omega)$ has equivalent norm $\| \Delta^k u\|_{L^2(\Omega)}$ and it can be proved by using regularity of Laplace equation. (The equivalent of $H^2\cap H_0^1$ can be proved by regularity in only TWO steps!)","['sobolev-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
1085083,Probability that rolling X dice with Y sides and summing the highest Z values is above some value k,"Some background: There is an RPG called Legend of the Five Rings, with an interesting dice system.  You roll X dice, and keep the highest Z of them.  You add those Z dice together.  This is phrased as ""X keep Z"".  All of the dice have ten sides, and if you roll a 10, it ""explodes"" (you roll again).  It continues to explode until you roll something other than a ten, adding all the values together, so that one die is worth more than 10. I'm trying to create my own RPG system, and am looking at different dice options.  That said, I'd like to know how to calculate several different probabilities similar to the L5R roll and keep system: 1) What is the probability that X keep Z on Y sided dice is greater than k, with exploding dice? 2) What is the probability that X keep Z on Y sided dice is greater than k, without exploding dice? 3) What is the probability that X keep Z lowest on Y sided dice is greater than k?","['dice', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

Using the notation and terminology on Wikipedia $H_0$ is therefore the set of all closed $0$-forms.

1085249,Limit of Suprema of Integrals,"This is my first post here.  I'm trying to play by the rules, so forgive me if it seems I'm asking too much. I've been working on the following problem: Let $\mu(\Omega)<\infty$, and $\ f_n:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\ \ n\geq 1\ $, $\ f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ be integrable functions such that $0 \leq f_n \to f$ a.e.,  and $\int_\Omega f_n d\mu \to \int_\Omega f d\mu$.  Show that 
$$
\lim_{a\to\infty}\sup_{n\geq1}\int_{\{f_n\geq a\}}f_nd\mu=0.
$$
Here's my initial attempt: By Egorov's theorem, we may obtain, for all $n\geq N$, $|f_n-f|<\epsilon_0$ on the set $\Omega \backslash A$, with $\mu(A)<\delta$, i.e. for all $n\geq N$ we have $f-\epsilon_0\leq f_n \leq f+\epsilon_0$ on $\Omega\backslash A$.  Now, we may choose an $a_1$ such that $$
\max_{1\leq n\leq N}\int_{\{f_n\geq a_1\}}f_nd\mu<\epsilon
$$ by the integrability of $f_n$.  Noting that for $n\geq N$ we have $\{f_n>a\}\subset\{f+\epsilon_0>a\}$, similarly (and this is somewhat awkward) we may choose an $a_2$ such that 
$$
\int_{\{f+\epsilon_0\geq a_2\}\backslash A}(f+\epsilon_0 )d\mu<\epsilon
$$
where the integrability of $\epsilon_0$ comes from the finiteness of $\mu(\Omega)$.  This gives for all $n\geq N$
$$
\int_{\{f_n\geq a_2\}\backslash A} f_n d\mu \leq \int_{\{f+\epsilon_0\geq a_2\}\backslash A}(f+\epsilon_0 )d\mu<\epsilon.
$$
Letting $a=\max\{a_1,a_2\}$, we have, for all $n$
$$
\int_{\{f_n\geq a\}}f_nd\mu = \int_{\{f_n\geq a\}\backslash A}f_nd\mu + \int_{\{f_n\geq a\}\cap A}f_nd\mu
$$
$$
<\epsilon +  \int_{\{f_n\geq a\}\cap A}f_nd\mu
$$
So this holds for suprema as well. Now, I'm trying to make use of the fact that $\mu(A)<\delta$ for the remaining integral, but I'm not sure how to proceed.  I imagine this is where I need to make use of convergence of the integrals.  I'm sure, given the awkwardness of this attempt, there is a better approach as well. Thanks! Edit I found a way to deal with the remaining integral, as I posted below, but I'm still curious to see if there is a more elegant approach to this problem.

However, it seems that the appeal to information content of a signal or distribution is via an appeal to entropy, hence to say that increasing entropy decreases informativeness seems circular, lacking any external foundation that would compel us to rationally equate Shannon entropy with information content (or, more precisely, the lack thereof). What is the foundational science/concept that warrants Entropy as a measure of information content? NOTE: I have read Shannon's original paper, where he discusses an axiomatic derivation of his entropy function -- but...he also takes pains to point out that this is not his primary justification (pp. 10-11 and App. 2, Shannon 1948 ). Instead, it was its empirical success in communications engineering that he felt warranted it's use. Also, note that the work of Renyi and Uffink have pointed out that Shannon's tenets are not the only way to construct a plausible information measure. However, nowadays, we are applying his formula to constructs like uncertainty distributions, which have little hope of experimental verification.

1085546,Can somebody help me on a simple chain rule differentiation problem [As level],"It's my first time using this forums so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong and pardon for my stupid question. So I believe that when you differentiate $2$ functions e.g $y = f(g(x))$, you would differentiate the inner one first, then the outer one with the inner function acting as $x$ like this: 
$$y = g'(x) \cdot f'(g(x))$$ However, I'm struggling to see where the definition of a function is. Let me illustrate: So in my book it says. $$y = 3\sin(2x)$$ Is this the same as f(g(y(x)))
Where $$f(x) = 3x$$ $$g(x) = \sin{x}$$ $$y(x) = 2x$$ In this case, It would differentiate to obtain: 
$$y'(x) \cdot g'(y(x)) \cdot f'(g(y(x)))$$ which would be $2 \cdot \cos{2x} \cdot 3(\sin{2x})$ However, this is wrong. The answer is $6\cos{2x}$ Could somebody please explain why or where I went wrong. It seems like that $f(x)$ is not considered as a function.

Prove that the function  $|f|-|g|$ attains its minimum on the boundary of $\Omega$. Some insights: Since $f$ and $g$ are holomorphic, their modulus $|f|$ and $|g|$ are subharmonic and attains maximum on the boundary. $-|g|$ is superharmonic and attains minimum on the boundary. Since $f$ does not vanish in the domain $log|f|$ is harmonic and attains minimum on the boundary. So in fact since $log$ is a monotonic function, $|f|$ also attains minimum on the boundary. In total we have a sum of two functions, $|f|$ and $-|g|$, both attain their minimum on the boundary. For general functions, this does not imply that the sum should attain minimum on the boundary.

Remarkably, different methods of regularization applied to this divergent series all give the same result, suggesting that the answer $-1/12$ is no ""accidental"" consequence of the method of regularization.

If we expand our function $f$ in a convergent power series, we get $$f(x) = 2 - \frac{(2)^3}{3!}(\pi x)^2 + \frac{(2\pi)^5}{5!}(\pi x)^4 - \cdots.$$ So we can differentiate term by term to produce the power series for the $k$th order derivative $f^{(k)}$, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Using this perspective, it's clear that we do not have any singularity at $x = 0$ that would cause $\int (f^{(k)})^2$ to blow up there. However, the power series method does not clearly show how each $f^{(k)}$ decays at infinity. To show the decay at infinity, I have tried the more brute force approach of just applying the quotient rule. For instance, away from $x = 0$ we have $$f'(x)= \frac{2\cos(2\pi x)}{x} - \frac{\sin(2\pi x)}{\pi x^2}.$$ Each term of $(f')^2$ will then have an $x^n$ factor, where $n \ge 2$, so that $f'$ is square integrable away from zero. This idea seems to have promise, but using the quotient rule it is more difficult to establish a formula for each $f^{(k)}$.

$$z^2=-x^4-p^2y^4$$ 
$$z^2=px^4+py^4$$ 
$$z^2=-px^4-py^4$$ The equations are not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$ so $\alpha \Gamma=\{ \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}}, p^2\mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} \}=\{ \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} \} \Rightarrow |\alpha \Gamma|=1$ $$\overline{b_1} \mid \overline{b}$$ For $\overline{b_1}$ there are the following possible values $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm p, \pm p^2, \pm 2p, \pm 4p, \pm 2p^2, \pm 4p^2$.

1085860,Relation between irreducible and completely reducible representations,"While studying representations of finite groups I got confused by the the statement that any irreducible representation is at the same time a completely reducible representation.
This doesn't seem to make any sense to me, since an irrep has per definition no (non-trivial) invariant subspace and therefore the carrier space can't be a direct sum of the invariant subspaces. Furthermore I am puzzled by the statement that any representation of a finite group is equivalent to a completely reducable representation. Let's consider for instance the symmetric group $S_3$ and it's 1-dim. representation $D_1: S_3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , $g_i \mapsto 1$. According to the just mentioned statement $D_1$ has to be equivalent to a completely reducable representation and therefore the direct sum of it's invariant subspaces (which is the set $\{1\}$) should make up the carrier space. Which is obviously not the case. Any ideas? I might add in view of the latest discussion about the question if not any arbitrary rep is completely reducible and hence the concept being useless: A representation $(D,V)$ is completely reducible if: $V$ is the direct sum of invariant subspace (true for any representation, if one considers $V$ and $0$ as invariant subspaces) and the projection of $D$ on the invariant subspaces $D|_{V_i}$ is irreducible (which is not true in general if one just considers $V$ and $0$ as the only invariant subspaces). Therefore the statement, that any representation is completely reducible is not true due to the second criterion. Thanks

Indeed, it follows from $\left|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right|\leq\mathcal{M}(f-g)$ that $$\left\|\mathcal{M}f-\mathcal{M}g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq\left\|\mathcal{M}(f-g)\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}\leq C\left\|f-g\right\|_{L^{p}}^{p}$$ It is a well-known theorem of Kinnunen that $\mathcal{M}:W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is a bounded operator. In the paper [H. Luiro, ""Continuity of the Maximal Operator in Sobolev Spaces""], the author claims that $\mathcal{M}$ is not sublinear . Is this a misprint, or am I missing something nontrivial? I understand why the argument for the $L^{p}$ case doesn't carry over for Sobolev space, since we also have to deal with the weak gradient, and therefore continuity is nontrivial. However, I don't see why restricting the domain affects sublinearity.","['operator-theory', 'harmonic-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
1086089,"""Twist"" of $\mathbb P^n_K$ through a field automorphism.","This question is closely related to this recent one . Suppose that $s:X\longrightarrow\text{Spec}\, K$ is a variety over $K$ (i.e. a $K$ scheme, separated, proper and geometrically integral) and consider a field automorphism $\sigma\in\text{Aut}(K)$. Then we define the varierty 
$$X^\sigma:=X\times_{\text{Spec}\, K}\text{Spec}\,K$$
which is the base change of $X$ through the morphism $\text{Spec}(\sigma):\text{Spec}\, K\longrightarrow\text{Spec}\, K$. The structural morphism of $X^\sigma$ is $p_2$.
In general $X$ and $X^\sigma$ are not isomorphic as varieties, in fact the map $p_1$ is a morphism of schemes but not a morphism of $K$-schemes. On the other hand should be true that $\mathbb P^n_K=\text{Proj} (K[x_0,\ldots,x_n])$ and $\left(\mathbb P^n_K\right)^\sigma$ are two isomorphic varieties, but I can't find this isomorphism.

1086117,Isomorphisms (and non-isomorphisms) of holomorphic degree $1$ line bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and elliptic curves,"I have two highly-coupled questions concerning holomorphic line bundles, and so I will go ahead and ask them together.  The first concerns line bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and the other concerns line bundles on a complex torus (elliptic curve). On a Riemann surface $X$, I can always define a so-called ""point bundle"", to use the terminology of Gunning's book on vector bundles (Princeton notes series). I can always pick a point $p$ and define a holomorphic line bundle $N_p$ of degree $1$, whose nonzero holomorphic sections vanish to order $1$ at $p$ and are nonvanishing elsewhere. 1. On $X=\mathbb{CP}^1$, there is only one such line bundle up to isomorphism, and we call this $\mathcal O(1)$, the hyperplane bundle.  I can prove this in the standard way, using the long sequence in cohomology associated to the exponential sequence, i.e. $H^1(\mathcal O^*)\cong H^2(\mathbb Z)\cong\mathbb Z$ on the projective line.  (The first isomorphism is the degree map and the second comes from the fact that the underlying topological space is compact and real $2$-dimensional.) But is there a way to see more directly that if $N_p$ and $N_q$ are two point bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^1$, then they must be isomorphic, even when $p$ and $q$ are distinct?  I thought about rotating the underlying $2$-sphere along the equatorial circle connecting $p$ and $q$, but does this rotation of the sphere lift to an isomorphism of bundles (and is it holomorphic)?  Is there a better way to see the isomorphism? 2. On an elliptic curve $X$, the isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles of a fixed degree are parametrised by another elliptic curve, the Jacobian.  If we take the Jacobian of degree $1$ line bundles, and we take a point $p\in X$, then we get a map from $X$ to the Jacobian by sending $p$ to the class $[N_p]$ belonging to the corresponding point bundle.  This map is an isomorphism.  Why?  In other words, if $p$ and $q$ are distinct points in $X$, then why are $N_p$ and $N_q$ non-isomorphic as holomorphic line bundles?  (Again, I don't want to use the cohomology of the exponential sequence.  It gives me that the Jacobian for a fixed degree is a torus of complex dimension $1$, the quotient of a copy of $\mathbb C$ by a lattice $\mathbb Z^2$, and that's great. But I want to see directly why the two line bundles cannot admit an isomorphism between them.)","['vector-bundles', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'holomorphic-bundles']"

1086143,Are set differences in a sigma algebra?,"I am confused as to whether or not the difference of two sets (A\B...the elements in set A that aren't in set B). I think they are. We know that a $\sigma$-field is both a $\pi$ system and a $\lambda$ system. By the definition of a $\lambda$ system, if we have A in the system, then so too $A^c$. We get the same with B and $B^c$ We also get that the intersection of A and B are in the $\sigma$-field by the fact that it is a $\pi$ system. So, I believe that the set difference of A and B should be in the sigma field. However, I've never heard anyone speak about the set difference of two sets being in the sigma field, only the normal ""compliments and countable unions of sets"". This seems like a good thing to have on hand if you are asked to write out the sigma field of a small discrete$\Omega$ by hand. By using set differences, you could generate the singletons, and then build up from there.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

1086196,Galois group of $x^5 + x^2 + 1$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_{2}$,"I'm uncertain if I am doing this problem correctly. This is an old algebra prelim problem regarding Galois theory. We have to find the Galois group of the irreducible polynomial (the problem already assumes so) $f(x)=x^5 + x^2 + 1$ over the field of two elements, i.e. $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. My attempt at a solution: Let $F$ be a splitting field of $f(x)= x^5 + x^2 + 1$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Now let $\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)$. Since any finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is Galois for $p$ prime, in this case we have $F= \mathbb{F}_{2}(\alpha)$. In the particular case of this problem, then the Galois extension $F/\mathbb{F}_{2}$ has degree $[F:\mathbb{F}_{2}]=5$ since $f(x)$ is irreducible of degree $5$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. I want to say that the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ is cyclic of order $5$, but I don't think that's correct. My reasoning: If I ended up with the result that $\textit{Gal}(F/\mathbb{F}_{2}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{5}$, that would have meant that $F$ was isomorphic to the splitting field of $x^{2^5}-x$, i.e. $\mathbb{F}_{2^5}$. Because of this, it would follow that $$ \textit{Gal}(F/\mathbb{F}_{2})= \langle \sigma_{2} \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_{5},$$ where $\sigma_{2}$ is the Frobenius automorphism for $p=2$. So my question is, is it true that $F= \mathbb{F}_{2^5}$, or is it isomorphic to it? Am I on the right track?","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra']"
1086198,"Deduce $\lvert ab\rvert = \lvert ba\rvert$ for all $a,b\in G$ where $G$ is a group.","It has been awhile since I took Abstract Algebra and decided to go back through Dummit and Foote. However, I have come across a problem I can't seem to figure out. If $x$ and $g$ are elements of the group $G$, prove that $\lvert x\rvert = \lvert g^{-1}xg\rvert$. Deduce that $\lvert ab\rvert = \lvert ba\rvert$ for all $a,b\in G$. Let $\lvert x\rvert = n$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    x^n & = (g^{-1}xg)^n\\
        & = \underbrace{(g^{-1}xg)\cdots (g^{-1}xg)}_{n\text{ times}}\\
        & = g^{-1}x^ng\\
        & = g^{-1}eg\\
        & = g^{-1}g\\
        & = e
  \end{align*}
  Thus, $\lvert g^{-1}xg\rvert = n = \lvert x\rvert$. Now, suppose $\lvert x\rvert = \infty$ and $\lvert g^{-1}xg\rvert = n$. Then
  $$
  g^{-1}x^ng = e\Rightarrow gg^{-1}x^ngg^{-1} = geg^{-1}\Rightarrow
  x^n = e
  $$
  which is a contradiction. That is, if $\lvert x\rvert = \infty$, then so does $\lvert g^{-1}xg\rvert$. The problem is I can't seem to deduce $\lvert ab\rvert = \lvert ba\rvert$. I imagine it isn't difficult, but I just don't see it.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
