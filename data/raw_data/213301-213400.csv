4311355,Abelian group $G$ such that the infinite-order elements form a subgroup with the identity.,"Let $G$ be an abelian group. If $\{g \in G \mid g=e \text{ or }g \text{ has infinite order}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ , what can we say about the order of the elements of $G$ ? My observations: It is trivial that any finite abelian group works for $G$ . Moreover, any group such that all its elements are of finite order is also a valid example of $G$ . Another possibility is to have a group such that every non-identity element has infinite order. For example, $\mathbb{Z}$ . My question: Is it possible to have a group with these properties such that it contains both finite and infinite-order non-identity elements? I have failed to find an example. And I strongly feel that no such example exists. But how can I prove this? Please help!","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups', 'infinite-groups']"

4311369,Effective Uniformization Theorem for the Torus,"The famous Uniformization Theorem asserts that for any Riemannian metric $g$ on the 2-torus $T^2$ there exists a function $\rho: T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and a flat metric $\bar{g}$ on $T^2$ such that \begin{equation*}
g=e^{\rho}\bar{g}.
\end{equation*} Philosophically my question is the following: If $g$ is ""almost"" a flat metric, can we say that $\rho$ is small? More precisely, does there for every (small) $\delta >0$ exist a constant $c=c(\delta)$ with the following property and so that $c(\delta) \xrightarrow{\delta \to 0} 0$ : Let $g$ be a metric on $T^2$ so that \begin{equation}
\mathrm{diam}(T^2,g) \leq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |K_g| \leq \delta,
\end{equation} where $K_g$ is the Gauss curvature w.r.t. the metric $g$ . Then there exists a function $\rho:T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ with \begin{equation*}
|\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta) \quad \text{for all } \, x \in T^2
\end{equation*} so that $\bar{g}:=e^{-\rho}g$ is a flat metric. Equivalently, can we say that the function $\rho$ whose existence is guaranteed by the Uniformization Theorem satsifies $|\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta)$ for all $x \in T^2$ ? Of course the flat metric in the conformal class of $g$ is only defined up to a multiplicative constant, and so $\rho$ is also only defined up to an additive constant. Since the bound $|\rho(x)| \leq c(\delta)$ can not hold if we change $\rho$ by arbitrary constants, there should be a normalizing condition on $\rho$ . In my opinion any of the following is a natural condition: Choose the flat metric $\bar{g}$ in the conformal class of $g$ so that the corresponding $\rho$ satisfies one of the following conditions: \begin{equation}
\int_{T^2}\rho \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=0, \quad \frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}(T^2)}\int_{T^2}e^{\rho} \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=1 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}(T^2)}\int_{T^2}e^{-\rho} \, d\mathrm{vol}_{\bar{g}}=1.
\end{equation} I tried proving this by obtaining PDE estimates. For this I needed the fact that for any flat metric $\bar{g}$ on $T^2$ and any $\rho:T^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ it holds \begin{equation}
e^{-\rho}\Delta\rho=-2K_g,
\end{equation} where $K_g$ is the Gauss curvature of the metric $g:=e^{\rho}\bar{g}$ and $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator of the flat metric $\bar{g}$ . Assuming the last of the three normalizing conditions above  I was able to prove an estimate \begin{equation}
e^{-\rho}-1 \leq c(\delta).
\end{equation} However, I was unable to prove a lower estimate $e^{-\rho}-1 \geq -c(\delta)$ . I would greatly appreciate an outline of how to prove it (or maybe have an idea what might work) or a reference in the literature stating this. Thanks in advance!","['partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

4311408,Wrong expected value definition in book? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Intuition behind using complementary CDF to compute expectation for nonnegative random variables (4 answers) Closed 2 years ago . I am currently hospitalised and reading a queueing theory book. I encountered in a proof this, and I fail to understand how this is true: $$E[R_j]=\int_0^\infty{P(R_j>u)du}$$ Other than the fact that $R_j$ is a random variable defined in $[0,\infty)$ I dont think that any further context is needed for my question. Due to my hospitalisation I don't have good access to my more basic probability books but I really don't recall reading any similar alternative definition for the expected value. If someone is curious or believes that the context is important, in a stochastic renewal process with holding times $X_j$ , for a given value $x>0$ , $R_j$ is defined as $R_j=X_j$ when $X_j\le x$ , and $R_j=0$ otherwise.

My first question is, is there a fast way to see if a statement does not hold or if it holds, to know what strategy to use to prove it does/doesn't. My try of proof after I got the info that it doesn't hold: So if the upper does not hold, then the following should hold: $$p \implies r \wedge t, t \vee s \implies \neg q, \neg s  \vee \neg r, \neg t \implies s \models p \vee q$$ Now we can prove this by contradiction: $$p \implies r \wedge t, t \vee s \implies \neg q, \neg s  \vee \neg r, \neg t \implies s , \neg(p \vee q) \models 0$$ So we get the following propositions: $C_1 :p \implies r \wedge t \equiv (\neg p \vee r) \wedge (\neg p \vee t)\\$ $C_2: t \vee s \implies \neg q \\$ $C_3: \neg s  \vee \neg r \\$ $C_4: \neg t \implies s \equiv t \vee s$ $C_5: \neg(p \vee q) \equiv \neg p \wedge \neg q$ $C_6: \neg p \quad$ (from $C_5$ ) $C_7: \neg q \quad$ (from $C_5$ ) $\vdots$ $C_n: 0$ However I do not know how to continue to get to the result which is $0$ and to finish the proof.","['logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4311591,Show that Riemann sum equals integral,"Suppose we have some continuous function $\textbf{F}\colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e. a force field) and a curve $\gamma\colon [a, b]\subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ in $C^1$ . Considering the partition $P$ of
the interval $[a, b]$ \begin{align*}
P= \left\{t_{0}=a, t_{1}=a + \frac{b-a}{n}, a + 2 \frac{b-a}{n} , \ldots,t_{n}= b\right\} \implies \Delta t = \frac{b-a}{n}
.\end{align*} I want to show that \begin{align*}
    \lim_{n \to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left\langle 
    \textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t_{k}^{*})\right), \left(\frac{\gamma(t_{k})-\gamma(t_{k-1})}{t_{k}-t_{k-1}}\right)\right\rangle

&= \int_{a}^{b}\left\langle  \textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t)\right),\gamma'(t)\right\rangle \mathrm{d}t

&=
\lim_{n \to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n}\left\langle   \textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t_{k}^{*})\right),\gamma'(t_{k}^{*}) \right\rangle\Delta t
.\end{align*} So let $\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary.
We can apply the mean value theorem componentwise, namely for all $1\le i\le m$ we have \begin{align*}
    \forall x,y \in [a, b] \colon \gamma_{i}(y)-\gamma_{i}(x)=\gamma_{i}'(\xi_i) (y-x), \quad \xi_i \in [x, y]

   \left\|\gamma'(y)-\gamma'(x) \right\|_{2}   <\epsilon
.\end{align*} Now, we choose $N>0$ s.t. \begin{align*}
\frac{b-a}{N}<  \delta

\\
\le 
&\Delta t\sum_{k=1}^{n} \left\| \textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t_{k}^{*})\right)\right\|_{2}\left(\left\|

<
&\Delta t \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left\|\textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t_{k}^{*})\right)\right\|_{2} \cdot \epsilon(\sqrt{m} +1) 
.\end{align*} The last inequality follows from the fact that \begin{align*}
    \frac{\gamma_{i}(t_{k})-\gamma_{i}(t_{k-1})}{t_{k}-t_{k-1}} = \gamma_{i}'(\xi_{i}), \quad \xi_{i} \in (t_{k-1}, t_{k})
\end{align*} and since $\xi_i-t_{k-1}<\delta$ we have \begin{align*}
    |\gamma_{i}'(\xi_{i})-\gamma_{i}'(t_{k-1})| < \epsilon
\end{align*} for all $1\le i\le m$ . Since $\left\|\textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t)\right)\right\|_{2} $ is a continuous function on a compact set it takes a maximal value, let
this be $M$ .
It follows that \begin{align*}
    \Delta t \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left\|\textbf{F}\left(\gamma(t_{k}^{*})\right)\right\|_{2} \cdot \epsilon(\sqrt{m} +1)
    \le (b-a)^{2} m\cdot M\cdot \epsilon(\sqrt{m} +1)
.\end{align*} Choosing $\epsilon$ in the beginning accordingly concludes the proof.","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'solution-verification']"

4311682,Solving $ 1.2^x \le \log_{1.2} (x) $,"I am stumped on this question, the best I can do is find a numerical solution but I would prefer to find an exact solution. The question is to solve: $$ 1.2^x \le \log_{1.2} (x) $$ According to Wolfram the numerical, or approximate solution is $0<x\le1.25773$ and $ x\ge14.7675$ . My attempt: $$ 1.2^x \le \log_{1.2} (x)

$$ Alternatively $ x \le \log_{1.2} \left( \log_{1.2} (x) \right)   ~,~~ x >0 $ . The thorniness is that $x$ is stuck on both sides of the inequality. Also the intended audience of the question is a 10-th grade Maths Class page 9, number 68. Perhaps the exact solution is something that becomes obvious in hindsight, like turning $1.2$ into $\frac 6 5$ , and use properties of exponents. We could attempt to solve $ 1.2^x = \log_{1.2}(x) $ or equivalently $ x= 1.2^{1.2^x} $ , since graphically the intersection of $f(x)=1.2^x $ and $g(x) = \log_{1.2}(x)$ determine the intervals where the inequality is true.","['algebra-precalculus', 'logarithms']"

Since $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $f(f(x)) = f(f(y))$ and so $(x-1)^3 - 1 = (y-1)^3 - 1$ , i.e. $x=y$ , we have that $f$ must be injective. In particular, $f(f(0)) = 0$ and $f(z) \neq 0$ for $z\neq f(0)$ . I was thinking to try to mimic a known nice construction for $f(f(x)) = ax$ for $a > 0$ - namely $f(x) = -x$ if $x\geq 0$ and $f(x) = -ax$ if $x<0$ . But if we try to use it here e.g. like $f(x) = -x$ for $x\geq 0$ and $f(x) = -x(x^2+3x+3)$ since $g(x) = x^2 + 3x + 3$ , even though positive, does not satisfy $g(x) = g(-x)$ . Any idea how to fix this or for perhaps some different construction? (If it is ""easy to describe"" it would be awesome, but I am open to any suggestions.)

4311789,Help showing the classical Legendre equation has limit circle boundary points.,"I am following this paper by Krall and Zettl . I am trying to use the results of Sturm-Louiville (SL) theory to study eigen functions of the classical Legendre equation: $$
\tag1 \frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\frac{du}{dx}\right)=\lambda u
$$ This SL problem is singular at the points $x=\pm1$ as around these points $(1-x^2)^{-1}$ is not locally integrable. I am trying to show that the end points are limit-circle. i.e. that for all solutions $u$ , of $(1)$ that $$\tag 2u\in L^2(-1,\beta) \quad \forall \beta \in (-1,1) \quad\text{ ( so $x=-1$ is limit circle)}$$ $$ \tag 3u\in L^2(\alpha,1) \quad \forall \alpha \in (-1,1) \quad\text{ ( so $x=1$ is limit circle)}$$ I know the solutions of $(1)$ are given by the Legendre functions $P_\lambda(x),Q_\lambda(x)$ and so I think showing $(2)$ and $(3)$ is equivalent to showing that the $L^2$ norms for both (??) $P_\lambda(x)$ and $Q_\lambda(x)$ are finite, i.e. showing $$\int^\beta_{-1} P_\lambda(x)^2 dx, \int^\beta_{-1} Q_\lambda(x)^2 dx \quad\text{and}\quad\int^1_{\alpha} P_\lambda(x)^2 dx,\int^1_{\alpha} Q_\lambda(x)^2 dx$$ are finite. Here is where I get confused, it is stated in the above linked paper that the SL problem is indeed limit circle at both endpoints. But, If $\lambda$ is taken to be an integer then $P_\lambda(x)$ is a finite degree polynomial and $||P_\lambda||<\infty$ is obvious. However $Q_\lambda(x)$ can still be singular in this case...  Is it the case that $Q_\lambda(x)$ diverges slow enough as $x \to \pm1$ to have a finite $L^2$ norm? In the case $\lambda$ is not an integer (this case I am most interested in), the behaviour of $P_\lambda$ and $Q_\lambda$ only get more singular around $x=\pm1$ . In the linked article by Krall et.al. it is mentioned that the classification of boundary points into limit circle / limit point is independent of $\lambda$ so I am assuming there must be some argument in the non-integer $\lambda$ case which shows the poles of $P_\lambda$ and $Q_\lambda$ diverge sufficiently slowly to be in $L^2$ . My first question is how can I show this? I suspect it might be possible by considering the representations of $P_\lambda$ and $Q_\lambda$ in terms of the hypergeometric series, however I have little experience with this and am worried about $_2F_1$ diverging when $x=-1$ since I think this is outside of $_2F_1$ 's radius of convergence... Maybe there is an asymptotic argument? My second question concerns the study of the associated Legendre equation, where the solutions are given by the associated Legendre functions $P^\mu_\lambda(x)$ , $Q^\mu_\lambda(x)$ . In this case are the boundary points still limit circle? To show it I think there might be a different weight function $w(x)$ but I think the procedure should be more or less then same. Would the spectrum still be discrete for the non-integer associated Legendre equation? (for example when the boundary conditions do not require bounded solution at the end points but only $L^2$ ) Thank-you for any insight or help you are able to provide!","['special-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'operator-theory', 'sturm-liouville', 'legendre-functions']"

4311852,Maximize grade in a multiple choice test using probability?,"This is a probability problem. Suppose you take a multiple-choice test consisting of $20$ questions whose answers are equally distributed (so, each letter corresponds to $4$ correct answers). Each question has $5$ alternatives, only one of them is correct. Further, in each question you're in equal doubt between the right and a wrong answer (so, the probability of correctly guessing it is $50\%),$ as follows: Is there an optimal choice of answers such that the grade is maximized? I don't really know the answer, but I believe it is affirmative, maybe using conditional probability. Remark. I thought to approach the problem in several steps. In each step, we shall choose the best answer. Step 1: In the first step, we shall compare the probability of getting each alternative right. As to the letter A in this step, the probability of getting it right should be $\frac{4}{6}$ (?), since we know there are 4 right answers between the 6 we choose (we must improve this idea). Here we should take into account the 50% hypothesis (?).  Maybe the probability of getting A right should be smaller, since I can expect to get half of my choices right (?). Maybe the numbers are not correct, I just want to illustrate the idea. Next, we compute the probability of getting B correct, then C, then D and then E. We shall choose the letter more likely to happen. Step 2: In the next step we shall proceed as in the first one, but disregarding the letter we have chosen and disregarding the questions we have answered in the first step. This will change the probabilities. Again we choose the more likely answer. We repeat the process till the last choice is made. In each step, a letter will be chosen and disregarded in the next step, so the procedure will end.","['conditional-probability', 'probability']"
4311886,Minimizing a generalized partial sum of a geometric progression,"Let $q$ be a rational number satisfying $1/2<q<1,$ so that $\left\{q^n\right\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is a decreasing infinite geometric progression with rational terms. Consider absolute values of generalized partial sums of this progression: $$\left|1\pm q\pm q^2\pm q^3\pm\,...\pm\, q^n\right|,$$ where $n$ is some fixed natural number, and each $\pm$ can independently be either a plus or minus sign. There are multiple possible choices of those signs, and I refer to all those expressions as generalized partial sums. A natural and interesting question to ask is: What is the smallest absolute value of a generalized partial sum that can be attained for given parameters $(q,n)?$ In other words, if we want to balance positive and negative terms as perfectly as possible, what is the best result we can get? Obviously, this question in each particular case can be solved by brute force, by computing values for all possible $2^n$ choices of signs. I decided to do some experiments, expecting to discover a simple pattern. Curiously, the results were quite unexpected and irregular. Let's consider a simple case when $q=2/3$ , and compute the sequence of smallest absolute values for $n=1,\,2,\,3,\,...$ It is clear that the denominators will be powers of $3$ , so we will multiply all terms of the sequence by the same factor $3^n$ to reduce everything to integers. In other words, we are looking for the smallest value of: $$\left|3^n\pm 3^n \left(\tfrac23\right)\pm 3^n \left(\tfrac23\right)^2\pm \,...\pm\, 3^n \left(\tfrac23\right)^{n-1}\pm 3^n \left(\tfrac23\right)^n\right|,$$ or, equivalently, $$\left|3^n\pm 2\cdot3^{n-1}\pm 2^2\cdot3^{n-2} \pm\,...\pm\, 2^{n-1}\cdot3 \pm 2^n\right|.$$ Here is the result: $$1,\,1,\,5,\,1,\,19,\,7,\,5,\,65,\,61,\,73,\,227,\,257,\,5,\,439,\,1253,\,2425,\,2035,\,833,\,2677,\,\dots$$ Here is a log plot of it: As you can see, the sequence is not monotone and seems to have no obvious pattern. It appears that the overall growth rate is—very roughly—exponential. Can we find asymptotic lower and upper bounds for this sequence?

4311904,Finding the ratio of areas between a polygon and the area of parabolas inscribed it,"This problem is taken from Facebook: I want to know how to solve it. I've also found a discussion that might be related to this here: polygon-of-greatest-area-having-vertices-on-parabola . However, I'm not sure if that's gonna help. I also provide the area of a parobola from this site , although, I don't know if it's reliable or not, hope you'll check that out and clarify. And here's my attempt (I use the formula from the site I gave above): We know for a regular polygon, the area is: $$A_{\text{Polygon}} = \frac12 pa$$ Where: $p$ is the perimeter and $a$ is the apothem. Note: the formula above will be written with different letters later . And the area of $n$ parabolas inside a polygon with $n$ side is: $$A_{\text{parabolas}} = \frac{2shn}{3}$$ Where $n$ is the number of the side, $h$ is the height of the parabola and $s$ is the length of the side of the polygon, i.e. $s=2a$ , as $a$ is the half of the length of the minor diameter of parabola. The area in blue should be: $$A_{\text{blue}} = sn\left(\frac12 \alpha - \frac23 h\right)$$ Where $\alpha$ is the apothem. That means the ratio is just $$\text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{\text{blue}} }{A_{\text{Polygon}}}$$ However, back to my problem earlier, does the formula of the area of the parabola already satisfy the variation like the yellow parabolas drawn in this picture?: Edit: The poster says that each parabola is tangent to the adjacent parabola at each vertex of the polygon where they meet. It's mean that the parabola is unique right? So, how's it gonna be?","['integration', 'geometry']"

4311930,Prove Harish-Chandra's theorem on central characters with algebraic-geometrical observation and the linkage relations among weights,"For representations of semisimple Lie algebras $L$ , we have the following theorem on central characters: Theorem (Harish-Chandra) : Let $\lambda, \mu \in H^{\ast}$ . Then $\chi_{\lambda} = \chi_{\mu}$ if and only if $\lambda \sim \mu$ . Notation issue : Let $L$ be a semisimple Lie algebra, $\mathcal{U}(L)$ be its universal enveloping algebra, $\mathcal{Z}(L)$ be the center of $\mathcal{U}(L)$ . Let $\lambda \in H^{\ast}$ . The action of $\mathcal{Z}(L)$ on the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ of $L$ induces a central character (or called the infinitesimal character) $\chi_{\lambda} : \mathcal{Z}(L) \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ . Linkage : We say $\lambda, \mu \in H^{\ast}$ are linked (written as $\lambda \sim \mu$ ) if $\lambda + \delta$ and $\mu + \delta$ are $\mathcal{W}$ -conjugate, where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Weyl group of the root system of $L$ (after the CSA $H$ is chosen). My two questions below are both related to understanding the notion of Linkage : Exercise 23.8 Prove that the weight lattice $\Lambda$ is Zariski dense in $H^{\ast}$ . Use this to prove the if part of the above quoted theorem. My question 1 is how to solve the above exercise? My attempt 1 : I have proved that the weight lattice $\Lambda$ is indeed Zariski dense by identifying $\Lambda$ with $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ and $H^{\ast}$ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ell}$ . Then $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ is indeed dense in $\mathbb{C}^{\ell}$ by noting $$
\overline{\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}} = Z(I(\mathbb{Z}^{\ell})) = Z(0) = \mathbb{C}^{\ell}.
$$ But I got stuck on how to carry on to show $\chi_{\lambda} = \chi_{\mu}$ for linked $\lambda$ and $\mu$ . Here is another exercise in Humphrey: Exercise 23.6 : If $\Lambda \in \Lambda^{+}$ , prove that all $\mu$ linked to $\lambda$ satisfy $\mu \prec \lambda$ , hence that all such $\mu$ occurs as weights of $Z(\lambda)$ . My question 2 is how to show the ""hence that"" part? My attempts 2 : I have managed to show the first part: Since $\delta$ is strongly dominant, we see $\lambda + \delta$ is strongly dominant. Since $\mu$ is linked to $\lambda$ , $\mu + \delta$ is $\mathcal{W}$ -conjugate to $\lambda + \delta$ . Hence by Lemma 13.2A of Humphrey's book, $\mu + \delta \prec \lambda + \delta$ , and hence $\mu \prec \lambda$ . But I got stuck on the ""hence that"" part. It seems that this part is a direct corollary of $\mu \prec \lambda$ ? But I cannot figure it out, as I know few on the weights of the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ . The only thing relevent that I can think of is Proposition 21.3 on the weights of $V(\lambda)$ , the irreducible highest weight representation. Is this related to the Harish-Chandra theorem quoted above? As the two are both related to the Linkage relation and the Verma module $Z(\lambda)$ , I listed the two questions in one post. Sorry for such a long post and thank you all for your answers and comments! EDIT after @Erica's hints on Question 2 : Following @Erica's hints on Question 2 , I have solved Exercise 21.4 in Humphrey's book using Lemma 21.2, this is also Proposition 23.2: Let $\lambda \in \Lambda, \alpha \in \Delta$ . If the integer $m = \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle$ is nonnegative, then the coset of $y_{\alpha}^{m+1}$ in $Z(\lambda)$ is a maximal vector of weight $\lambda - (m+1)\alpha$ . So for any $\mu \prec \lambda$ , to show that $\mu$ is a weight of $Z(\lambda)$ , it suffices to find a simple root $\alpha \in \Delta$ such that $\mu = \lambda - (m+1)\alpha $ . In the proof of the Corollary 23.2, we have seen that $$\lambda - (m+1)\alpha = \sigma_{\alpha}(\lambda + \delta) - \delta.$$ So in other words, we shall find some simple reflection $\sigma_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{W}$ such that $\mu + \delta = \sigma_{\alpha}(\lambda + \delta)$ . But it seems that the only thing we know from the linkage of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ is that there exist $\sigma \in \mathcal{W}$ such that $\mu + \delta = \sigma(\lambda + \delta)$ , but how can we make $\sigma$ to be a simple reflection (i.e. $\sigma = \sigma_{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha \in \Delta$ )? Note that $\mathcal{W}$ is generated by simple reflections, we obtain $\sigma = \sigma_{\alpha_1} \cdots \sigma_{\alpha_r}$ for some $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_r \in \Delta$ . But I got stuck here. I have tried to show ""by induction on $r$ "" but failed. We haven't invoke $\mu \prec \lambda$ or $\lambda \in \Lambda^{+}$ in this part.

4312077,Primitive permutation groups containing a cycle,"I am trying to prove the following result: Let $G$ be a primitive permutation group on $\Omega$ of degree $n$ that contains a cycle $g$ fixing $k \geq 3$ points. Then, $A_n \leq G$ where $A_n$ is the alternating subgroup of degree $n$ . This is a generalisation of Jordan's theorem in which the cycle is of prime length. The generalisation has been achieved in a paper by Gareth Jones (2013) in a more general theorem that also deals with the cases of $k \in \{0,1,2 \}$ . The proof, however relies on the classification of finite simple groups, which I would like to avoid using if possible. I have managed to show that the theorem is implied by induction if I can prove the base case of $k = 3$ , and also that this base case is true if such a group must contain any element of degree strictly less than 5 (where the degree of a group element is the number of points moved by the element). This is where I am stuck. Of course, since this theorem is true, clearly such an element must exist but I am not sure how to show this. I might be hitting a dead end here if the classification of finite simple groups is an essential tool in proving even this simplified version, but I still want to give it a shot. Any suggestions or insight will help. Also, if anybody has a good reason why this would be a dead end without application of the classification of finite simple groups, this would also be good to know! Specifically I am trying to show that either the case $k=3$ is true or that if $k = 3$ , then $G$ contains an element that moves at most four points. I know that such a group is 4-fold transitive and I also know how to show that it is true when the length of the cycle $g$ is less than 5.

4312231,Conormal sheaf in the analytic category and Kähler differentials,"As discussed here the Kähler differentials $\Omega^1_K$ and the ordinary differentials $\Omega^1$ of a complex manifold $(M,\mathcal{O}_M)$ are not the same. As sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_M$ -modules, $\Omega^1$ is finitely generated while $\Omega^1_K$ is not. Now, Kähler differentials may be constructed as follows: Take $\mathcal{O}_M\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{O}_M\to \mathcal{O}_M$ the multiplication map and denote by $J$ its kernel. Then $\Omega^1_K\cong J/J^2$ . On the other hand, take the multiplication $\mathcal{O}_M\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{O}_M\to \mathcal{O}_M$ of the analytic tensor product ( $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^k}\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^l}=\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^{k+l}}$ ) and denote its kernel by $I$ . Then $I/I^2\cong \Omega^1$ . It confuses me that these two construction give two wildly different answer. For example I tried to prove $de^x=e^xdx$ in $I/I^2$ and have not been able to do so. One has to prove that in $\mathcal{O}_M\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{O}_M$ the following holds $1\hat{\otimes}e^x - e^x\hat{\otimes} 1 \mod I^2 = e^x(1 \hat{\otimes}x - x \hat{\otimes}1) \mod I^2$ . Moreover, however this proof works, it needs to fail if one tries to adapt the proof for the ideal $J$ . Has someone worked this out explicitly or any ideas on how to do this? It should probably be a rather neat calculation. In general, the tensor product $\mathcal{O}_M\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{O}_M$ is quite weird in the analytic category as it does not describe an analytic space. All of this probably just exemplifies that the fiber product in the algebraic category is different to the analytic fiber product.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Any hint or help will be appreciated. Edit: This is what I came up with:
First of all we have to define the maps, the first one is trivial: \begin{align}
\phi_1:1&\rightarrow K_0^*\\
1&\mapsto 1
\end{align} And $\text{Im}(\phi_1)=1$ .
For the second one, the most natural map is the inclusion: \begin{align}
\phi_2:K_0^*&\rightarrow K_0(C)^*\\
f&\mapsto f
\end{align} And $\ker(\phi_2)=1$ , $\text{Im}(\phi_2)=K_0^*$ . For the third one it follows immediate by the definition of principal divisor: \begin{align}
\phi_3:K_0(C)^*&\rightarrow \text{Div}_{K_0}^0(C)\\
f&\mapsto \sum_{P\in C} v_P(f)P
\end{align} (Here $v_P$ is the valuation of the DVR asociated to the point $P$ of the curve). And $\ker(\phi_3)=K_0^*$ .
The fourth one must be the projection onto the quotient: \begin{align}
\phi_4:\text{Div}_{K_0}^0(C)&\rightarrow \text{Jac}_{K_0^*}(C)\\
D&\mapsto D+\text{Pr}(C)
\end{align} Now I should prove that the sequece is exact. $\text{Im}(\phi_1)=1$ , $\ker(\phi_2)=1$ and $\text{Im}(\phi_2)=K_0^*$ are trivially true so we only have to prove that $\ker(\phi_3)=K_0^*$ and $\text{Im}(\phi_3)=ker(\phi_4)$ . Let us see this: $\ker(\phi_3)=K_0^*$ : $\phi_3(f)=0\Leftrightarrow \sum\limits_{P\in C} v_P(f)P=0\Leftrightarrow v_P(f)=0~\forall~P\in C$ . And this trivially holds iff $f\in K_0^*$ . $\text{Im}(\phi_3)\subset \ker(\phi_4)$ : That is easy, if $D\in\text{Im}(\phi_3$ ) then $D$ is a principal divisor and so $\phi_4(D)=0$ . $\ker(\phi_4)\subset \text{Im}(\phi_3)$ : Let $D\in\ker(\phi_4)$ , then $\phi_4(D)=0$ and so $D\in\text{Pr}(C)$ . Hence there exists some $f\in K(C)$ such that $D=\sum\limits_{P\in C} v_P(f)P$ . Let us prove that $f\in K_0(C)^*$ . If $\sigma\in\text{Gal}(K/K_0)$ then, since $D$ is galois invariant $D^{\sigma}=D$ and hence the element $f^{\sigma}/f$ corresponds to the zero divisor ( $v_P(f^{\sigma}/f)=0~\forall~P\in C$ ). This can only happen if $f^{\sigma}/f\in K_0(C)$ and in particular $f\in K_0(C)^*$ , as we wanted to prove. To prove that $\phi_4$ is surjective if $g=1$ I tried the following: Let $\overline{D}\in \text{Jac}_{K_0}(C)$ , then by definition $\overline{D}\in \text{Jac}(C)$ and $\overline{D}^{\sigma}=\overline{D}~\forall~\sigma\in\text{Gal}(K/K_0)$ . As $\overline{D}\in \text{Jac}(C)=\text{Div}^0(C)/\text{Pr}(C)$ there exists $D\in\text{Div}^0(C)$ tal que $\overline{D}=D+\text{Pr}(C)$ .We want to find $D'\in\text{Div}^0_{K_0}(C)$ such that $\phi_4(D')=D+\text{Pr}(C)$ which happens iff $D'+\text{Pr}(C)=D+\text{Pr}(C)$ iff $D'-D\in\text{Pr}(C)$ . Since $g=1$ and $D'-D$ is a principal divisor we have $l(D'-D)=1$ (by a Riemann-Roch corolary), but I don't know how to end, I feel like I need to be able to write $D'$ in terms of $D$ but again the part of Galois invariance is giving me problems.","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Since we're given that $B$ is countable, then by definition there must exist some $g$ s.t. $g : \mathbb{N} \to B$ , with $g$ surjective. Then, it must be the case that $A$ is similarly countable because since $B$ is countable, and $f : A \to B$ , for this to hold it's necessary that $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ . Because $\mathbb{N}$ is countable, then $A$ is countable.

4312416,Mistake in proof of Lemma 2.3 in Chapter 3 of Stein and Shakarchi's Fourier Analysis,"I'm reading Fourier Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi and it seems to me that there's a mistake in the proof of Lemma 2.3 in Chapter 3. I wonder if there's something I'm missing or if someone could suggest an alternative proof. Any insight would be appreciated! Lemma 2.3 states: ""Suppose that the Abel means $A_r = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty r^n c_n$ of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n$ are bounded as $r$ tends to 1 (with $r < 1$ ). If $c_n = O
(1/n)$ , then the partial sums $S_N = \sum_{n = 1}^N c_n$ are bounded."" The proof is as follows. Let $r = 1 - 1/N$ and choose $M$ so that $n|c_n| \leq M$ . We estimate the difference $S_N - A_r = \sum_{n = 1}^N (c_n - r^n c_n) - \sum_{n = N+1}^\infty r^n c_n$ as follows: $|S_N - A_r| \leq \sum_{n = 1}^N |c_n| (1-r^n) + \sum_{n= N+1}^\infty r^n |c_n| \leq M \sum_{n=1}^N (1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \sum_{n = N+1}^\infty r^n \leq MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = 2M$ , where we have used the simple observation that $1-r^n = (1-r)(1+r+\cdots + r^{n-1}) \leq n(1-r)$ . So we see that if $M$ satisfies both $|A_r| \leq M$ and $n|c_n| \leq M$ , then $|S_N| \leq 3M$ . The mistake I notice here is in the line where the authors claim that $MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = 2M$ . By my calculations, using their assumption that $r = 1 - 1/N$ , we instead have the following: $MN(1-r) + \frac{M}{N} \frac{1}{1-r} = M(N-1) + \frac{M}{N-1} = M(\frac{(N-1)^2 + 1}{N-1}) = M \frac{N^2 - 2N + 2}{N-1} = M \frac{(N-1)(N-2)}{N-1} = M(N-2)$ . This clearly isn't bounded. Thank you again! Any insight would be appreciated!","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
4312498,Polya's urn as a counterexample for the Kolmogorov 0-1 law,"Consider a simple formulation for the Polya urn model. An urn contains two balls at time 0, one is white and the other is black.

4312528,About definition of the global Hecke algebra and the automorphic form,"Introduction I am trying to understand various definitions (which I hope them equivalent) of automorphic forms. My main problem is to describe with the global Hecke algebra rather than the group and the universal enveloping algebra. My main purpose is to understand the contents of [GJ] or [JL]. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a global field $F$ . the Global Hecke Algebra Firstly, I introduce the definition of the global Hecke algebra. There is no problem to define the global Hecke algebra as the restricted tensor product of local Hecke algebras, and there is no problem to define the local Hecke algebra for a non-Archimedean place. The problem is how to define the Archimedean parts. Let $v$ be an Archimedean place and $K_v$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G_v$ $\mathcal{H}_v(G_v,K_v)$ is defined to be the convolution algebra of distributions of $G_v$ supported on $K_v$ ([Ge] Def.3.6), and with additionally the $K_v$ -finiteness condition. (one can show left finiteness $\Leftrightarrow$ right finiteness) ([Bu] p311, ""by Flath"") I notice that to be connected with the universal enveloping algebra one need the following structure theorem: $\mathcal{H}(G_v,K_v)\simeq \mathcal{H}(K_v)\otimes_{U(\mathfrak{k}_\mathbb{C})}U(\mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{C})$ . ([Ge] p28, 5.4; [Bu] p311; [KV] p71, Cor.1.71) Remark: I think the $K_v$ -finiteness condition is necessary. My question is: is this definition which we use most? the Automorphic Forms Secondly, (assume the definition of the global Hecke algebra is correct) I am now give some definitions of automorphic forms on $G(\mathbb{A})$ from different books. Let $\phi: G(\mathbb{A}) \to \mathbb{C}$ be a complex valued function on $G(\mathbb{A})$ , and $\omega: F^\times\backslash\mathbb{A}^\times\to U(1)$ a fixed unitary idelic character. We introduce the following conditions: (LI): (left invirance) $\phi(\gamma g)=\phi(g)$ for all $\gamma \in G(F)$ and $g \in G(\mathbb{A})$ . (CC): (central unitary character) $\phi(ag)=\omega(a)\phi(g)$ for all $a \in Z(G(\mathbb{A}))$ and $g \in G(\mathbb{A})$ . (SM): (smoothness) $\phi$ is smooth. (GC): (growth condition) If $F$ is a number field then $\phi$ is of moderate growth/ slowly increasing. (KF): ( $K$ -finiteness) $\phi$ is right $K-$ finite. Above are the common conditions of different versions. (ZF): ( $\mathcal{Z}-$ finiteness) $\phi$ is $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}})-$ finite. (AD): (admissibility) The $\mathcal{H}-$ space $V$ which is the $\mathcal{H}-$ spanning of $\phi$ is admissible, i.e., for any elementary idempotent element $\xi$ in $\mathcal{H}$ , $\xi V$ is finite dimensional. (ND): (non-degeneration) There is an elementary idempotent element $\xi$ in $\mathcal{H}$ , $\xi\phi=\phi$ . (IZ): (ideal of $\mathcal{Z}$ ) This is a (finite-codimensional [?]) ideal of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}})$ that annihilates $\phi$ . Then I give three version of additional conditions for automorphic forms: Version 1:  (ZF).  ([GF] Def.4.7.6; [Bu] p299) Version 2: (AD). ([GJ] p145-146; [JL] Def.10.2) Version 3: (ND) + (IZ). ([Yo] Def.4.1; [Ge] Def.6.12) Remark: I think the finite-codimensional condition is needed in (IZ). My main interest is to show Version 2 is equivalent to Version 1, and to show Version 2 implies (ND) (since it is a very useful condition). However I am really not familiar with the Archimedean case and also I am a little worried when seeing such many different but expectedly equivalent definitions. So I wish help for the explicit problem and also advise on how to deal with it. Reference [GJ] Zeta functions of simple algebras , Godement, Jacquet.

I'm trying this with either Lindeburg or Lyapunov with the following statement: if $X_i$ are bounded then $|X_i| <= M$ for some M and thus $X^2$ is bounded too by $M^2$ .  The Lindeburg condition is: $\lim_{n \to \inf}$ $\frac{1}{s^2_n}\sum_n$ $\int_{|X_i| \gt \epsilon*s_n} X^2_i dP$ Since the $X^2_i$ are bounded then they can be taken out of the integral and thus the sum becomes a sum of constants divided by inf $\to$ 0 and thus the Lindeburg condition holds which means a central limit exists.","['statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'probability-theory']"

My class is beginning to learn about centralizers, which, if I am not mistaken, is the set of all elements $x$ in a group $G$ that commute with a specified element $a$ in $G$ . To help us calculate the cardinality of the centralizer of an element in $S_5$ , my teacher has introduced the orbit-stabilizer theorem $|O_x| \cdot |G_x| = |G|$ (I still do not understand what an orbit or stabilizer refers to). He states that the cardinality of the centralizer of an element in $S_5$ is $|G_x|$ (because I am still confused as to what a stabilizer is, I am not sure how this is true) and that $|O_x|$ is the ""conjugacy class"" (I do not remember the exact terminology my teacher employed), so we can calculate $|G_x|$ by finding $\frac{|G|}{|O_x|}$ . To lead us to finding $|O_x|$ , my teacher has stated that we have to show an equivalence between the ""conjugacy class"" and the cycle types of $S_5$ ; to do so, we must show $\tau(i) = j \implies a\tau a^{-1}(a(i)) = a(j)$ for cycles $a, \tau$ .

4313112,The dimension of a tangent space of a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold is actually $k$,"From Ted Shifrin's comment "" We only need to restrict attention to a small neighborhood of $\phi(x)$ to apply the chain rule at a single point "" in his answer, I'm trying to formalize it to make things clear. Could you have a check on my proof? First, I recall related definitions to remove ambiguity. A subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is  called a smooth $n$ -dimensional manifold if $\forall x \in X$ , $\exists$ a diffeomorphism $\varphi: U \to V$ such that $V$ is open in $X$ , $U$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , and $x \in V$ . Then $\varphi$ is called a local parameterization of $V$ . The inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ is called a local coordinate system , or chart , on $V$ . Let $X \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be a smooth $n$ -dimensional manifold and $x \in X$ . Let $\varphi: U \to V$ be a local parameterization around $x \in V$ . The continuous linear map $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^N$ is the Fréchet derivative of $\varphi$ at $\varphi^{-1}(x) \in U$ . The tangent space of $X$ at $x$ , denoted by $T_xX$ , is defined as the image of $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}$ , i.e., $$T_xX := \operatorname{im} \left (\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} \right ).$$ Theorem: Let $X \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be a $k$ -dimensional smooth manifold and $x \in X$ . Then the tangent space $T_xX$ is a vector space of dimension $k$ . Proof: Let $\varphi:U \to V$ be a local parameterization around $x$ . Here $U$ and $V$ are open in $\mathbb R^k$ and $X$ respectively. Also, $x \in V$ . Let $\varphi^{-1}$ be the inverse of $\varphi$ and $y := \varphi^{-1} (x) \in U$ . Let $\phi : V' \to \mathbb R^k$ be a differentiable extension of $\varphi^{-1}$ around $x$ . Here $V'$ is open in $\mathbb R^N$ and $x \in V'$ . Also, $\phi$ and $\varphi^{-1}$ agree on $V' \cap V$ . There exist $r_1, r_2>0$ such that $\mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1) \subseteq V'$ and $\mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_2) \subseteq U$ . Thanks to the differentiability and thus the continuity of $\varphi$ , there exists $r_3 > 0$ such that $z \in \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_3) \implies \varphi(z) \in \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1)$ . Let $r_4 := \min\{r_2, r_3\}$ and $U' := \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_4)$ . Notice that $U'$ is open in $\mathbb R^k$ and $y \in U'$ . Also, $$\operatorname{im} ( \varphi_{\restriction U'} ) \subseteq \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1) \subseteq V' = \operatorname{dom} \phi.$$ Then the map $\Psi := \phi \circ \varphi_{\restriction U'}$ is well-defined and differentiable at $y$ . Moreover, $\Psi$ is the identity map on $U'$ , so $\mathrm d\Psi_y$ is the identity map on $\mathbb R^k$ . By chain rule, $$\mathrm d\Psi_y = \mathrm d \phi_{\varphi (y)} \circ \mathrm d\varphi_{y}.$$ This means $\mathrm d \phi_{\varphi (y)}$ is surjective, while $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} = \mathrm d\varphi_{y}$ is injective. Hence $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}$ is indeed an isomorphism between $\mathbb R^k$ and the tangent space $T_xX$ . This completes the proof. Update: Writing down the details reveals why we can not apply the same strategy to show $N=k$ (which is indeed not correct!). To succeed, we want to find an open neighborhood $A$ of $x$ in $V'$ such that $\Phi := \varphi \circ \phi_{\restriction A} = \operatorname{id}_{A}$ . However, the only thing we know is $\varphi \circ \phi_{\restriction A \cap V} = \operatorname{id}_{A \cap V}$ . This is because we have no information/restriction on the behavior of $\phi$ on $A \cap V^c$ . Let $A \subseteq \mathbb R^m$ , $B \subseteq C \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ , and $D \subseteq \mathbb R^p$ . Let $f:A \to B$ and $g:C \to D$ be differentiable/smooth in this sense . With the same technique of restriction, we can show that $h := g \circ f:A \to D$ is also differentiable/smooth. Fix $x \in A$ and let $y:=f(x)$ . Then there is a differentiable extension $\varphi:U \to \mathbb R^n$ of $f$ around $x$ . Here $x\in U$ , $U$ is open in $\mathbb R^m$ , and $\varphi$ agrees with $f$ on $A \cap U$ . Similarly,  there is a differentiable extension $\phi:V \to \mathbb R^p$ of $g$ around $y$ . Here $y \in V$ , $V$ is open in $\mathbb R^n$ , and $\phi$ agrees with $g$ on $C \cap V$ .

4313441,Calculate the binomial probability for $N$ events,"Background I have a question that I've been thinking about a lots and haven't been sure about the answer. Here is the question. Bob and Alice play a game called ""Change and Guess"". Basically, Alice has an array including $800000$ numbers that Bob has to guess. Since there are a lot of numbers to guess so Alice decides to give Bob all the numbers ( $800000$ ) in the array. However, Alice will first change $512$ numbers at random in the array then give the array to Bob. Bob's also aware of that every time he asks there will be $512$ numbers that are changed in the array. Bob can ask as many times as he wants and will have to guess the numbers after that. Bob takes the strategy that counting the appearances for each number in the array and take the majority one to find out the original value for each number. He'll do that process for $800000$ numbers and bring them back to Alice.
How many times that Bob as least has to ask in order to have $99.9999999\%$ chance of guessing all the numbers right using the mentioned strategy above** Here is an example: Since the length of the array is big and to keep everything simple, the example below is just a simplified version of the question demonstrates how the Bob/Alice game works. The length of the array is just 5 numbers and Alice changes only 1 number each time in the example but It will be 800000 numbers and Alice can change 512 numbers in the array for real question. Alice has an array $X = [1,2,3,4,5]$ Bob asks Alice for $3$ times. Alice then will change some numbers in the array and then give them to Bob each time. The $3$ arrays can look like: $$X_1 = [1,2,3,4,6]$$ $$X_2 = [1,2,3,10,5]$$ $$X_3 = [100,2,3,4,5]$$ Now Bob can look at those arrays and start guessing the values. So for each position for $3$ arrays, Bob counts the appearance and picks the highest one with the hope that the majority one will be the original one. First position : $1$ appears $2$ times, $100$ appears $1$ times. Bob picks $1$ . Second position : $2$ appears $3$ times. Bob picks $2$ . Third position: $3$ appears $2$ times, $2$ appears $1$ times. Bob picks $3$ . ..
.. Then at the end, Bob's guessing array will be $X = [1,2,3,4,5]$ My Attempt So this is what I thought so far: The probability of picking one number from an array is $512/800000 = 0.00064$ .
So for $N$ times, in order for this strategy to be failed, there must be at least one number that is picked at least $(N/2) + 1   times (\gt50\%)$ so the changed valued will get picked based on majority vote. Based on the binomial probability formula. The probability of an event happens exactly $K$ times out of $N$ times is: Binomial probability formula In this case, we need to calculate the probability for $K$ from $(N/2) +1$ to $N$ . This will be calculated by the sum of applying the formula for $K$ from $(N/2) + 1$ to $N$ . I'll call that $$P(k\ge (N/2) +1 )$$ I ran $N$ from $2$ to $100$ : $$N=2, P(k\ge (N/2) +1 ) = 4.0960000000000007e^{-7}$$ $$N=3, P(k\ge (N/2) +1 ) = 1.2282757120000002e^{-6}$$ $$N =4, P(k\ge (N/2) +1 ) =  1.0480726835200003e^{-9}$$ $$N =5, P(k\ge (N/2) +1 ) = 2.6189240618450956e^{-9}$$ $$N=6, P(k\ge (N/2) +1 ) = 2.5140061068171685e^{-12}$$ $$\vdots$$ So on it keeps getting closer to $0$ . So in order to have $99.9999999\%$ success, Bob probably need $4$ iterations at least. I'm wondering that whether there was any approach other than mine for this question or not. Is there anything else I haven't considered yet. Any help would be appreciated.","['statistics', 'probability']"
4313442,Why does confidence interval need to be symmetric about the point estimate and contiguous?,"This post could be entitled as ""Interpretation of confidence interval 2"" according to the prior question.
( Interpretation of confidence interval )
I've read the QA but still not gotten to the point. I am not the same person who asked the previous question, but I came upon quite a similar interpretation problem on confidence interval (CI). Mine was why CI needs to be an INTERVAL while we can find arbitrary candidate of 90% or 95% area that contains the true value. This question is partly solved. Above in the very old post, the answer quoted ""Although the various methods are equal from a purely mathematical point of view, the standard method of computing confidence intervals has two desirable properties: each interval is symmetric about the point estimate and each interval is contiguous."" But these listed desirable properties of CI, 1) symmetry and 2) contiguity, do not seem theoretically apparent. Of course, CI is one of the expressions on confidence of an estimator, so these two properties should be full-filled so that CI is human-friendly. But don't we have any further reasons why we choose contiguous symmetric interval for representation of an estimation? (for frequentist?) The reason why this thing is not so much discussed in the quoted article ( http://onlinestatbook.com/2/estimation/confidence.html ) might be partially because CI is often used to show the results of an research and decision making but not directly adopted for future experimental or statistical refinement. But, I want to make clear why the prefered summarized expression of confidence (which is Confidence Interval: CI) should be symmetric (in some sense, in some scale) about the point estimate and contiguous from theoretical, practical and decision making perspectives. The topic may have something to do with Equal-Tail Interval (ETI, one of Credible Interval: CI) in Bayesian interpretation. I am quite a beginner in statistics, so the actual point might be ""In what sense Equal-Tail Interval (for Bayesian) is desirable (for frequentist?)"" or ""Equal-Tail Interval preserves & well-summarize something of the posterior distribution (and if ETI were to be used as a kind of prior in frequentist perspectives, would preserve something?)"". Maybe since I started statistics from Bayesian, I cannot catch up with frequentist approach, so I'm sorry that I only have very vague ideas about these things, but please mention anything. Let me summarize. Why should Confidence Interval: CI (not Credible Interval) symmetric and contiguous? Thank you. P.S. In a declined answer, I found CI like $(-\infty, \alpha)$ is less informative than conventional CIs. But if we consider only the property of 95% confidence, there’s no difference between conventional CI and weird ones (or weird expression of confidence). Something is making conventional CI (contiguous & probability-symmetric ) more informative & well-summarizing. Then, I understood the point is “how CI could be good summary of statistical results”. CI by definition is equal-tail & probability-symmetric , so this property might be enough to decode the point estimate as well as variance of the estimator to some extent on a given distribution. (ex $\sigma^2$ estimation by $\chi^2$ -dist) Is this part of reasons why CI as a summary of data need to be contiguous and probability-symmetric ?

In addition, we also have $$\mathcal{F}(\cos(3x)) = \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2}}[\delta(\xi - 3) + \delta(\xi + 3)].$$ Therefore, the ODE system follows: $$\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
\widehat{u_t}(\xi,t) & = & -\xi^2\widehat{u}(\xi,t) + \sqrt{2\pi}e^t\delta(\xi)\\
\widehat{u}(\xi,0) & = & \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2}}[\delta(\xi - 3) + \delta(\xi + 3)].
\end{array}\right.$$ For each $\xi \in \mathbb{R}$ , we can explicitly solve the ODE by the integral factor method, obtaining: $$\widehat{u}(\xi,t) = \dfrac{\sqrt{2\pi}\delta(\xi)}{1 + \xi^2} e^{t} + Ke^{-\xi^2 t}$$ where $K$ is a constant. From the initial condition, it follows that $$K = \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2}}[\delta(\xi - 3) + \delta(\xi + 3)] - \dfrac{\sqrt{2\pi}\delta(\xi)}{1 + \xi^2}.$$ Therefore, applying the inverse Fourier transform, it follows that: $$u(x,t) = e^t + \cos(3x) - 1.$$ Doubt: I don't know if I'm faltering on some calculation, but this solution doesn't seem to satisfy me $u_t - u_xx = e^t$ .

Here are my thoughts: given $f\in F$ , since $f(0)=0$ and $f$ is differentiable at $0$ , $$f(t)\ln(t) = \frac{f(t)-f(0)}{t-0} \times  t\ln(t)\xrightarrow[t\to 0]{} 0 $$ hence integration by parts is licit and yields $$\varphi(f) = -\int_0^1 f'(t) \ln(t) dt$$ from which we derive $|\varphi(f)| \leq \|f'\|_\infty \int_0^1 |\ln(t)| dt = \|f'\|_\infty\leq \|f\|_{C^1}$ . Therefore $\|\varphi\| \leq 1$ . However, this upper bound seems too loose. When experimenting with low-degree polynomials I find that $\displaystyle \frac{|\varphi(f)|}{\|f\|_{C^1}}\leq \frac 12$ .

4314227,Do we need Zorn's lemma in the proof that every subset of measurable functions has an essential supremum?,"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal F,P)$ be a probability space and let $\bar{\mathcal L}(\mathcal F)$ denote the set of measurable functions $f:(\Omega,\mathcal F)\to (\bar{\mathbb R},\mathcal B(\bar{\mathbb R}))$ . Given a subset $\mathcal S\subset \bar{\mathcal L}(\mathcal F)$ , the essential supremum of $\mathcal S$ , written $\text{ess sup } \mathcal S$ , is defined as any $f\in \bar{\mathcal L}(\mathcal F)$ satisfying $f\geq g$ a.s. for all $g\in \mathcal S$ . $f'\geq g$ a.s. for all $g\in \mathcal S$ , then $f'\geq f$ a.s.. Clearly the essential supremum of $\mathcal S$ , if it exists, is unique a.s.. The essential infimum of $\mathcal S$ , $\text{ess inf } \mathcal S$ , is defined similarly, replacing inequalities $\geq$ by $\leq$ in the above definition. If $\mathcal S=(f_n)$ is countable, then $\text{ess sup } \mathcal S=\sup_{n} f_n$ and $\text{ess inf } \mathcal S=\inf_{n} f_n$ a.s.  since the pointwise supremum/infimum of a sequence of measurable maps is measurable. The answer here proves the following theorem using Zorn's lemma. I wonder if this is really necessary. Theorem. $\text{ess sup } \mathcal S$ exist for any subset $\mathcal S\subset \bar{\mathcal L}(\mathcal F)$ . Moreover, if $\mathcal S$ is nonempty there exists a sequence $(f_n)\subset \mathcal S$ such that $\text{ess sup } \mathcal S=\sup_{n} f_n$ a.s.. If $\mathcal S$ is upward directed then the sequence $(f_n)$ can be taken to be nondecreasing a.s.. An analogous claim holds for $\text{ess inf } \mathcal S$ . Proof. We will show the claim for $\text{ess sup } \mathcal S$ ; the claim for $\text{ess inf } \mathcal S$ follows by considering $- (\text{ess sup } (-\mathcal S))$ . Clearly $\text{ess sup } \emptyset=-\infty$ so we can assume $\mathcal S\neq \emptyset$ . We can also assume WLOG that $\mathcal S$ consists of nonnegative and bounded real-valued functions, because the map $x\mapsto \phi(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}+\arctan(x)$ is an order preserving homeomorphism from $(\bar{\mathbb R},\mathcal B(\bar{\mathbb R})) $ to $([0,\pi],\mathcal B([0,\pi]))$ . Indeed $f$ is an essential supremum of $\mathcal S$ if and only if $\phi \circ f$ is an essential supremum of $\phi(\mathcal S):=\{\phi \circ g: g\in \mathcal S\}$ . Let $$s = \sup \left\{ \int \max\{g_1,\ldots,g_k\} \,dP: \,
g_1,\ldots,g_k\in \mathcal S, k\geq 1\right\}\,<\infty$$ For each $n$ there exists a finite subset $\mathcal S_n\subset \mathcal S$ such that $s-\frac{1}{n}<\int \max \{g \in \mathcal S_n\} \,dP\leq s$ . Let $(f_n)$ be an enumeration of the countable set $\cup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal S_n$ , let $u_n=\max\{f_1,\dots,f_n\}$ for each $n$ , and let $f:=\sup_{n} u_n=\sup_{n} f_n$ . Then $\int u_n \, dP \uparrow s $ as $n\to \infty$ , and by the MCT we have $s=\int f \, dP$ . I claim that $f$ is an essential supremum of $\mathcal S$ . First we show that 1. holds. Suppose on the contrary that $g>f$ for some $g\in \mathcal S$ on a set $A\in\mathcal F$ with $P(A)>0$ . Then $\int \max\{f,g\}\, dP > \int f\, dP = s$ . But $\max\{u_n,g\} \uparrow \max\{f,g\}$ so  by the MCT we have $\int \max\{f,g\}\, dP=s$ , a contradiction. For 2. we note that if $f'\geq g$ a.s. for all $g\in \mathcal S$ then in particular $f'\geq f_n$ a.s. for each $n$ so $f'\geq \sup_{n} f_n=f$ a.s.. Finally suppose $\mathcal S$ is upward directed, meaning that for any $g_1,g_2\in \mathcal S$ there exits $g_3\in\mathcal S$ satisfying $\max\{g_1,g_2\}\leq g_3$ a.s.. Then we can find an a.s. increasing sequence $(h_n)$ in $\mathcal S$ satisfying $u_n\leq h_n$ a.s. for each $n$ . Then we can define $f:=\sup_n h_n$ and finish the proof as before.

4314638,Birkhoff ergodic theorem for ergodic Markov processes,"This question might be easy but I am really stuck on it. Let $M$ be compact metric space and $\mathcal B(M)$ the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of M. Consider the discrete-time Markov process, $$\mathbf{X} =\left(\Omega,\{\mathcal F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}, \{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}, \{P_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N} , \{\mathbb P_x\}_{x\in M}\right), $$ with state space $(M,\mathcal B(M)$ (I am considering that $0\in\mathbb N$ )  i.e. $(\Omega,\mathcal F_n),$ is a filtered measurable space, $X_n:\Omega\to M$ is $\mathcal F_n$ measurable, $\mathbb P_x [X_0 = x] =1,$ for every $x\in M,$ For every $0 \leq n \leq m \in \mathbb N,$ $f:M\to\mathbb R$ bounded measurable function, and $x\in M$ $$\mathbb E_x [f(X_{n+m}) \mid \mathcal F_n] = (P_m f)(X_n), \ \mathbb P_x\ \mathrm{a.s.}, $$ where $P_n$ is a transition function on $(M,\mathcal B(M)),$ i.e. a family of probability maps $P_n : M\times \mathcal B(M) \to [0,1],$ such that $P_0(x,\mathrm{d} y) = \delta_x(\mathrm{d}y),$ $P_n(x,\cdot)$ is a Borel probability measure for every $x\in M.$ For every $n,m \in \mathbb N$ and $A\in\mathcal B(M),$ $$P_{n+m}(x, A) = \int_{M} P_n(y,A) P_m(x,\mathrm{d} y).  $$ Assume that $\mathbf{X}$ admits an ergodic stationary measure $\mu$ on $M,$ i.e. $$\int_{M} P_n(x,A) \mu(\mathrm d x) = \mu(A),\ \forall \ A\in\mathcal B(M),  $$ and if $$P_1(x,A) = 1,\ \forall \ x \ \mu\text{-a.s.}\ \in A \Rightarrow \mu(A) = 0\ \text{or }1. $$ Question: I would like to know if under this setup we would have the following
ergodic theorem. For every $f\in L^1(M,\mathcal B(M), \mu),$ we obtain $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f (X_n(\omega)) = \int_{M} f(x)\mu(\mathrm{d} x),\ \forall\ \omega \text{-}\mathbb P\ \text{a.s.,}   $$ where $\mathbb P(\mathrm{d} y) := \int_{M}\mathbb P_x (\mathrm{d} y) \mu(\mathrm{d} x).$ Comments regarding my question Consider $\mathbf{X}$ being an ergodic Markov process (using the above notation). For every $n\in\mathbb N$ let us consider the projection map \begin{align*}
\pi_n : M^{\mathbb N}&\to M\\
(x_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}&\mapsto x_n.
\end{align*} If we define (via Komolgorov extension Theorem) the Borel probability measure $P_\mu$ on $M^\mathbb N$ as the unique Borel probability, such that given $A_0,\ldots,A_n \in M,$ then $$P_{\mu}\left(\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N} \in M^{\mathbb N}; x_i\in A_i, \ \forall \ i\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\}\right) = \int_{A_0}\int_{A_1} \ldots \int_{A_{n-1}} P_1(x_{n},A_n) P_1(x_{n-1},\mathrm{d}x_n) \ldots P_1(x_0,\mathrm{d} x_1) \mu(\mathrm{d}x_0). $$ We have that the shift \begin{align*}
\theta: (M^{\mathbb N},\mathcal B(M^{\mathbb N}) , P_\pi)&\to (M^{\mathbb N},\mathcal B(M^{\mathbb N}),P_\pi) \\
(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb N}&\to (x_{n+1})_{n\in\mathbb N},
\end{align*} is an ergodic dynamical system and we have that for every $f\in L^1(M,\mathcal B(M),\mu)$ $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(\pi_i(\omega)) = \int_M f(x) \mu(\mathrm{d} x),\ \forall \ \omega\text{-}P_\pi\ a.s.. $$ How do I translate the information of the canonical process (the one above) to the original Markov process $\mathbf{X}$ ? For every $\omega \in \Omega$ , we have that $$\left( X_n(\omega))_{n\in\mathbb N}\right) \in M^{\mathbb N}, $$ and $$\pi_i\left(\left(X_n(\omega)\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}\right)  = X_i(\omega).$$ But it is not clear that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f( X_i(\omega) ) = \int_M f(x) \mu(\mathrm{d} x),\ \forall \ \omega\text{-}\mathbb P\ a.s., $$ where $\mathbb P (\mathrm{d} y) = \int_M \mathbb P_x(\mathrm{d} y) \mu(\mathrm{d}x), $ can anyone help me?","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'markov-process', 'probability-theory', 'dynamical-systems']"
4314656,The maximum order of the elements of a group and the number of elements that have that order,"I was reading this article about the number of elements that have the maximum order of a group, where it proves that if you have a group $G$ and if $m = \max\{o(g) : g ∈ G\}$ is finite and exactly $k$ elements of $G$ have order $m$ , where $k$ is finite, then G is finite and we have the following upper bound $$
|G| ≤\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)}.
$$ And then says the following: Using the notation of Theorem A, we note that if $G$ has exactly $k\leq\infty$ elements of maximum order, then there are only finitely many possibilities for $m$ since $\varphi(m)$ divides $k$ . Where Theorem A is the theorem mentioned above. My question is if the fact that $\varphi(m)|k$ is true and why. It seems to me that this could be true for finite groups but again I don't know the proof if there is one. Also if this is false I would be grateful if someone could give a counterexample.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups']"

4314683,How to derive the distribution of the uncertainty of the measurement of vector's components from the distribution of the uncertainty of its modulus?,"Consider a real vector $$
\mathbf{p} = (p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})
$$ representing some observable. Its measurement allows determining the modulus $p\equiv \sqrt{p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}}$ only up to some uncertainty $\Delta p$ , i.e. what we measure is $$
P = p+ \Delta p,
$$ The probability distribution for $\Delta p$ is the Gauss distribution that has $p$ -dependent sigma: $$
f(\Delta p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma(p)}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Delta p}{\sigma(p)}\right)^{2} \right]
\tag 1
$$ Let us assume that the uncertainty is non-zero only for $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$ , i.e., $$
\mathbf{P} = (p_{x}+\Delta p_{x}, p_{y}+\Delta p_{y},p_{z}) \Rightarrow P = p+\Delta p
$$ Then, my question is: how to find the distribution corresponding to the uncertainties $\Delta p_{x}$ and $\Delta p_{y}$ if knowing the distribution corresponding to the uncertainty $\Delta p$ ? P.S. $\sigma(p)$ has the property $\sigma(p)\ll p$ . Another property is that $\Delta p_{x}$ , $\Delta p_{y}$ are distributed identically.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
4314787,My school mysterious trigonometry test question,"So I was working on my math test and the whole class and I couldn't do 2 numbers from the test. I ask another class they couldn't do it either. Until I found the answer from my study group, I ask how did they got those answer, but all of them said, someone gave me the answer. All study groups that I joined have the same answer. So I'm really confused, and am wondering if those question really have the same answer? These are the questions: Number 1 $\tan(A)+\tan(B)=\sqrt 6$ $\cos(A)\cos(B)=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt 3$ The question is find the value of $\tan(A+B)$ Number 2 $\sin(X+Y)=A\sin(X-Y)$ Find the value of $(\frac{A+1}{A-1})\tan(Y)$ Here are my attempts: Number 1 $\tan(A+B)=\frac{\sqrt6}{1-\left(\frac{\sin(A)\sin(B)}{(\frac{1}{6})\sqrt 3}\right)}$ Number 2

On the other hand, a crude approach such as the left-hand side being at least $(z+1)\binom{2n-1}{n+z}$ works if and only if $$ \frac{\binom{2n-1}{n+z}}{\binom{2n-2}{n+z}} \geq \frac{2z+3}{z+1} \Leftrightarrow \frac{2n-1}{n-z-1} \geq \frac{2z+3}{z+1} \Leftrightarrow 2(z+1)^2 \geq n $$ i.e. $z$ is of order $\sqrt{n}$ or higher. So it could be indeed the case that, given $n$ , the possible $z$ are from something about $\sqrt{n}$ to $n-1$ , but I have no idea how to even start proving this, as I cannot find any useful strong non-asymptotic inequalities anywhere.
