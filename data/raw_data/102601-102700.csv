1431293,$2(n-2)+1$ does not divide $(n-2)(n-3)/2$ for $n \ge 8$,"For $n \ge 8$ the number $2(n-2)+1$ never divides $(n-2)(n-3)/2$. Any ideas how to prove this? I see that $(n-2)(n-3)/2 = 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-3)$. If I suppose that $2(n-2)+1$ divides $(n-2)(n-3)/2$ then it should also divide their difference 
\begin{align*}
 (n-2)(n-3)/2 - (2(n-2) + 1) & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-3} k - (2n - 3) \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-4} k + (n-3) - 2n + 3 \\
      & = \sum_{k=1}^{n-4} k - n \\
      & = \frac{(n-3)(n-4)}{2} - n.

1431303,"Trouble with definition of countable, denumerable","I found the following definition: Definition . A set is countable iff its cardinality is either finite or
  equal to $\aleph_0$. A set is denumerable iff its cardinality is exactly $\aleph_0$. A
  set is uncountable iff its cardinality is greater than $\aleph_0$. The null set is countable. The finite set, {A, B, C}, is countable.
  The infinite set, $\mathbb{N}$, is countable and denumerable. Sets with a larger cardinality than $\mathbb{N}$ are uncountable. I have trouble with seeing the difference between countable and denumerable, apart from the part that the cardinality is finite. Isn't ""A set is countable iff its cardinality equal to $\aleph_0$"" and ""A set is denumerable iff its cardinality is exactly $\aleph_0$"" the same?","['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"

1431403,"How to refer to the ""sign"" of the dependence of events?","How would you express the inequalities $P(A\cap B)\lessgtr P(A)P(B)$? If two random variables are correlated, $E[XY]\lessgtr E[X]E[Y]$, we call them positively or negatively correlated according to the direction of the inequality. Positively correlated variables tend to vary in the same direction, and negatively correlated variables tend to vary in opposite directions. I just realized that I don't really know how to express the analogue for dependent events – the fact that the events are more or less likely to occur together than one might expect from their individual probabilities. I could say that their indicator variables are positively or negatively correlated, and it seems to be a common abuse of terminology to say that the events themselves are positively or negatively correlated, but that seems suboptimal, since without the adverb indicating the sign we'd call them dependent and not correlated. Is there such a thing as positively or negatively dependent events? A Google search for ""negatively dependent"" mostly turns up definitions of ""negatively dependent random variables"" (e.g. here and here ), not negatively dependent events. How else could this concept be expressed? Is ""positively or negatively correlated"" the least bad option?","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'terminology']"
1431415,Technique for predicting attractor capture in nonlinear differential equations? (quasi-pendulum equation),"I'm working on simulating this equation (application is motor control, not that it matters): $$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+b\frac{d\theta}{dt}=a \sin (x-\theta)$$ where $x = vt$ for $t > 0$, and I'm finding that for given initial conditions $\frac{d\theta}{dt}|_{t=0}$ and $\theta|_{t=0}$, there seems to be a critical value $v_{crit}$ such that: if $v < v_{crit}$, $x-\theta$ oscillates but settles down to its equilibrium value $\phi = \sin^{-1} \frac{bv}{a}$ (""capture"") if $v > v_{crit}$, $x-\theta$ tends to a linearly increasing difference + a small oscillating term. Predicting the value of $v_{crit}$ is important in my application, and I would like to understand what is going on. My training in nonlinear differential equations is rather limited and rusty, and I never took advanced classes... I think there might be some insight using energy techniques (Hamiltonians? Lyapunov stability ?) since there is similarity to a driven pendulum equation ($\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}+\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta = u(t)$), but I can't figure out what. How can I figure out this critical value? Can anyone point me towards some reference material (or even the right terms to look up) so I could learn a technique to solve my problem? It seems like if I can show that $|x-\theta|$ reverses direction before it hits $\pi$, then capture is guaranteed. okay, splitting into 1st-order systems: $\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\omega} &=& -a \sin(\theta - x) - b\omega \cr
\dot{\theta} &=& \omega
\end{eqnarray}$ Change of variable $u = \theta - x$ so $\dot{u} = \omega - v$ and $\ddot{u} = \ddot{\theta} = \dot{\omega}$: $\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\omega} &=& -a \sin u - b\omega \cr
\dot{u} &=& \omega - v
\end{eqnarray}$ If I try to write a Lyapunov equation $E = c\omega^2 + d \cos u$ I get $$\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{E} &=& 2c\dot{\omega}\omega - d \dot{u} \sin u \cr
&=&2c\omega(-a\sin u - b\omega) - d (\omega - v) \sin u \cr
&=&\omega \sin u (-2ac - d) -2bc\omega^2 + dv \sin u 
\end{eqnarray}
$$ I can make the first term go away if I choose d=-2ac; the second term is negative if $c>0$ but I can't get rid of the third term. Attempt #2: $E = (\omega-v)^2 - 2a \cos u$ I get $$\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{E} &=& 2\dot{\omega}(\omega-v) +2a \dot{u} \sin u \cr
&=&2(\omega-v)(-a\sin u - b\omega) +2a (\omega - v) \sin u \cr
&=&(\omega-v) \sin u (-2a + 2a) -2b\omega(\omega-v) \cr
&=& -2b\omega(\omega-v) \cr

Explicitly, $A$ is equivalent to $B$, denoted $A \sim B$, if there is a one to one and onto function from $A$ to $B$. It can be shown that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. In particular, this implies that if $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$, then $A \sim C$. Here is my question:
Now consider the intervals $I_n=[0,1/n]$. Then $I_1 
\sim I_{2} \sim I_3...$ From this we have that $I_1 \sim I_n$ for all $n$. Now $\lim _{n \to \infty}I_n=\{0\}$. So $I_n \sim \{0\}$. However, this is not the case. I am thinking that what went wrong here is that $I_1 \sim I_n$ does not imply that $I_1 \sim \lim_{n \to \infty} I_n$.

1431609,Suppose that $f: \mathbb{R^+}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\lim_{x\to \infty} (f+f')(x)=0$. Show that $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)=0$. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How can this be proved $\lim_{x\to\infty}(f(x)+f'(x))=l$ [duplicate] (5 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Suppose that $f: \mathbb{R^+}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\lim_{x\to \infty} (f+f')(x)=0$. Show that $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)=0$. This is one solution I found to this problem. Solution: If $x=a$ is in the domain of the function $f$, then by the generalized mean value theorem applied to the functions $e^x f(x)$ and $e^x$, there exists $c\in (a,x)$ such that $\frac{e^x f(x)-e^a f(a)}{e^x -e^a}=\frac{e^c f'(c)+e^c f(c)}{e^c}.$ This yields $\frac{e^x}{e^x -e^a} f(x)-\frac{e^a}{e^x - e^a}f(a)=f'(c)+f(c)$. Taking limits as $c$ tends to infinity we have, 
$\lim_{c\to \infty}\frac{e^x}{e^x -e^a} \lim_{c\to \infty}f(x)-\lim_{c\to \infty}\frac{e^a}{e^x - e^a}\lim_{c\to \infty}f(a)=\lim_{c\to \infty}[f'(c)+f(c)]$. But $c\lt x$, thus we obtain $1 \cdot \lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)-0\cdot f(a)=\lim_{c\to \infty}[f'(c)+f(c)].$ Hence, since the right hand side is equal to $0$, it follows that $\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)=0.$ Taking a close look at this solution, however, I think it may not be correct since the $c$ used in the answer is actually a function of $x$ and it may not make sense to take $c\to \infty$. I mean how do we know that there will always be such a $c$ greater than any given positive number? Is this solution correct? If so, how can my question be answered?

1431876,Kolmogorov's probability axioms,"Why Kolmogorov's axioms are considered such a breakthrough in probability theory? They are just 3 simple statements everyone can agree with. When creating a system of axioms like this it's necessary the list of the axioms is complete. Suppose we forget about the 3rd Kolmogorov's axiom. Then we would have 2 axioms everyone could agree with when thinking about probability. Does it mean the 2 axioms are enough to claim this is a good axiomatic system of probability? We know it's not, because there's the 3rd axiom left out. But maybe these 3 axioms are not sufficient as well in a similar manner. Look at Euclid's fifth axiom (parallel postulate). If we ommit fifth postulate, we get hyperbolic geometry, which is certainly no what we wanted to have. A similar question arises here - are those axioms sufficient? Are we sure we won't get any unintended results just following these 3 axioms? Or maybe the statement that a given set of axioms agrees with our intuition of, let's say, probability must itself be treated as an axiom. We cannot prove it. Kolmogorov axioms survived so many years with no major complaints, then they are believed to match our intuition regarding what probability is accurately. But there are areas where it doesn't work (like quantum mechanics, which is well known for being weird and counter-intuitive). But why those axioms apparently do work in our 'common' and 'everyday' probability problems? Maybe we haven't discovered a case where they fail? Quoting The Logico-Algebraic Approach to Quantum Mechanics Volume I: Historical Evolution , C.A. Hooker Editor, page 172 : It is obvious that since the Kolmogorov axioms are rooted in empirical
  experience, any change in the theory, if by such change one wants to
  extend its applications to the physical world, should spring directly
  from some phenomenological considerations. Anticipating our
  discussions in the subsequent sections one might say that the point of
  departure for the contemplated change in the model can be traced to
  the remarkable discovery that the physical systems arising in quantum
  physics are of such nature that one is no longer entitled to make the
  assumption that the associated experimental proposition constitute a
  Boolean sigma-algebra. As a consequence, the conventional i.e. the
  Kolmogorov formalism of probability theory is inadequate for a precise
  description of these systems. As a spectacular instance of such
  failure we may mention the facts that the notion of disjoint events is
  at a somewhat deeper level and that the identity
  $P(A+B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)$ is not always true (the examples of Feynman are
  concerned with this failure among other things).","['probability', 'axioms']"

1432401,Room square construction (Howell design),"Using superimposed orthogonal Latin squares to construct a balanced tournament design, I get an n x n array of unique ordered pairs.  If I only want unique unordered pairs, I can eliminate half of the ""broken"" diagonals (the diagonals other than the main diagonal), replacing their content with empty cells, to get a Room square or Howell design. For example, in a square of 7 x 7, I find that the diagonals parallel to the main diagonal that start in columns 1, 2, and 4 contain the same set of pairs as the diagonals that start in columns 6, 5, and 3, respectively, but with the symbols reversed, (x,y) (y,x).  I can eliminate the cells in either of those two sets of diagonals and preserve the property that each symbol appears only once in each row and in each column.  Intuitively, I suspect that this pattern is a result of the fact that I transposed my Latin square to obtain its orthogonal Latin square. In this example, I used (6i + 2j) mod 7 as my composition operator and obtained the following juxtaposed orthogonal Latin squares. M  |  0    1    2    3    4    5    6

  $P(P(x))=P(x) \forall x$. Show that if $\Omega$ is a Banach space, then all projections of
  $\Omega$ are continuous. This exercise is in the chapter of the open mapping theorem, and the closed graph theorem, so it is a pretty big hint that I am supposed to use one of these. My first attempt (open mapping): Since $P(\Omega)$ is closed, it is a Banach space. Then if we look at $P: \Omega \rightarrow P(\Omega)$, it is an open mapping. Let U be an open set of $\Omega$, then I need to show that $P^{-1}(U)$, is open. We have that $P^{-1}(U)=P^{-1}(U\cap P(\Omega))$, $U\cap P(\Omega)$ is an open set in $P(\Omega)$. So I need to show that $P^{-1}(U\cap P(\Omega))$ is open. I don't see how it beeing an open mapping helps me, because that is sadly the other way. I tried contradiction: Assume for contradiction that: $P^{-1}(U\cap P(\Omega))$ is not open. Then it must also contain a limit point for its complement.So then there exists x, so that $P(x)\in U$, but $z_n \rightarrow x$, $P(z_n)\ne U$. This implies among other things, that any image of any open ball around x, is both open(open mapping theorem), and contain elements from both U and its complement. But still, this is no contradiction as far as I see. Any tips? My second attempt (closed graph theorem). Since we are working in a Banach space, if I can show that P is a closed operator I will be done. So assume $\lim x_n = x$, then I must show that if $\lim T(x_n)$ converges, then $\lim T(x_n)=T(x)$. So assume that $\lim x_n = x$ and that $\lim T(x_n)=y$. Assume for contradiction that $y \ne T(x)$, then we are in the case where $\lim T(x_n)\ne T(x)\rightarrow \lim T(x_n-x)\ne 0$. Hence we are in the case where we have a sequnce $z_n\rightarrow 0$, but $T(z_n)$ converges, but it does not converge to 0. I can't get a contradiction in the case either.

1432698,When is a vector field hamiltonian with respect to some symplectic form?,"Given a vector field $v$ on a $2n$ -dimensional manifold, how many symplectic forms are there on $M$ that make $v$ a hamiltonian vector field? Alternatively, take the set of all $(H,\omega)$ pairs, mod adding constants to $H$ and doing $(H,\omega)\to (\alpha H,\omega/\alpha)$ . Each element of this set may be associated to a vector field via the map $v^i=\omega^{ij}\partial_j H$ (call the map $F$ for later reference). The question is: given a vector field $v$ , what does the preimage of $v$ under this map look like (is it empty/one element/large/etc)? This question is inspired by this answer, where Qmechanic gives this local existence theorem: Let there be given a $2n$ -dimensional manifold $M$ with a non-vanishing vector field $X\in\Gamma(TM)$ . Does there locally exists a symplectic two-form $\omega$ , such that $X$ is a Hamiltonian vector field? Answer: Yes! My question differs in that I am interested in uniqueness/non-uniqueness in addition to existence, and I am interested in any obstructions to the existence of a global two-form satisfying the quoted result (aside from the manifold itself not supporting a symplectic structure). For completeness, here are my (haphazard and muddled) attempts at answering this question: The zeroth thing I did was make the following (probably very flawed) degree of freedom counting argument, forgetting about topological obstructions etc. It takes $2n$ functions on $M$ to specify $v$ , $2n-1$ functions on $M$ to specify $\omega$ (since we can add gradients to the tautological one form without changing $\omega$ ), and $1$ function for the hamiltonian. Thus the very naive reasoning suggests that vectors $v$ should be in correspondence with pairs $(H,\omega)$ . As we see below this fails to happen (even for well-behaved examples), so I would be interested in how to make this sort of argument properly. The next thing I tried was to work out some specific cases. The hamiltonian flow for the harmonic oscillator, which on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(q,p)$ looks something like $(p,-q)$ , seems to be hamiltonian with respect to any symplectic form which is a function of $p^2+q^2$ (which seems like a lot of freedom). In particular, let $d\equiv (p^2+q^2)/2$ and consider the hamiltonian $H=f(d)$ and the symplectic form $\omega=f'(d) dq\wedge dp$ . Given any function $f'(d)$ which is nonzero everywhere, $\omega $ so defined will be a globally defined two-form, and $H$ will be a globally defined hamiltonian, such that the image of $(H,\omega)$ under $F$ is $v$ . Now let us consider a slightly different situation. Let's work on $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{0\}$ , and define $v$ to be the flow $(-q,-p)$ (i.e. a radially inward flowing vector field). This is obviously not hamiltonian under the usual form on $\mathbb{R}^2$ , but if I did the Mathematica right, any symplectic form of the form $$\omega = \frac{f'(p/q)}{q^2} dq\wedge dp,$$ with a hamiltonian of the form $H=f(p/q)$ , will reproduce this vector field. In this case, unlike before, not any positive $f'$ will give us a globally defined symplectic form, since for instance $f(x)=x$ would produce singularities at $q=0$ . Thus, even though locally we have the same freedom to pick $\omega$ , globally we do not. However, the choice: $$f(x)=\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}$$ (which I basically found by guess-and-check) seems to produce a globally defined symplectic form and hamiltonian, so there still exists a global symplectic form on our space with respect to which this vector field is hamiltonian. Evidently according to this comment , we can also find vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{0\}$ that don't admit any $(H,\omega)$ pairs globally, although presumably there is still a lot of freedom in picking those pairs locally. Is there any obvious geometric feature/property that we can use to distinguish these three cases just from looking at $v$ ? Lastly, I wanted to briefly note the following. On some manifolds we can choose vector fields that are locally hamiltonian but not hamiltonian (like the last example before; see, for instance, Exercise 7 here ). In this situation, we can find a globally defined symplectic form $\omega$ , and a collection of locally defined hamiltonians, such that on each patch $v$ arises via hamilton's equations. However, one could imagine a situation where no one global symplectic form will do, no matter how ""multivalued"" we allow $H$ to be. Is there one? I couldn't think of how to come up with one.","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'classical-mechanics']"

1432721,Examples of Cohen-Macaulay integral domains,"Question 1 Could you find a non Cohen-Macaulay ring $A$ without zero divisors. I would like $A$ to be as simple as possible. For instance, I want $A$ to be finitely generated alegbra over $\mathbb{C}$. Comment I found plenty of examples of non Cohen-Macaulay rings in wiki and from other sources. But those rings are not integral domains. Question 2 A projective curve is called ACM if it's homogeneous coordinate ring is Cohen-Macaulay. It would be great if one give me an example of non ACM curve in $\mathbb{P}^3$.","['cohen-macaulay', 'algebraic-geometry', 'integral-domain', 'commutative-algebra']"
1432729,What are better approximations to $\pi$ as algebraic though irrational number?,"I know that $\pi \approx \sqrt{10}$, but that only gives one decimal place correct. I also found an algebraic number approximation that gives ten places but it's so cumbersome it's just much easier to just memorize those ten places. What's a good approximation to $\pi$ as an irrational algebraic number (or algebraic integer if possible) that is easier to memorize than the number of places it gives correct? EDIT: Algebraic number preferably of low degree, such as $2$ or $3$ (quadratic or cubic).","['approximation', 'pi', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1432794,"1. Measurable sets : uncountable union, 2. null set is disjoint from translated rationals","I am doing exercises in Real analysis for Graduate students by Richard F. Bass and I am stuck. Suppose $A$ is a Lebesgue measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and 
$$B = \cup_{x \in A}[x-1, x+1].$$
Show that $B$ is Lebsgue measurable. I think it is immediate if $A$ is countable. However, for uncountable set $A$.
I was given a hint to work on open interval, then come to closed interval later. Let $$B' = \cup_{x \in A} (x-1,x+1).$$ Then $B$ is open set in $\mathbb{R}$, so $B$ can be written as a countable union of disjoints open intervals, and hence measurable. I see that $B = B' \cup (\cup_{x \in A}\{x-1, x+1\})$. But if $A$ is uncountable, I stuck with $$\cup_{x \in A}\{x-1, x+1\}.$$ Any suggestion to move on from this ? If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with zero Lebesgue measure ($m(A) =0$), then $$A \cap (c + \mathbb{Q}) = \phi$$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}.$
I was guided to look at $\cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}(q+A)$. But I find nothing from there except $m(q+A) = 0$ for all $q \in \mathbb{Q}.$","['lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1432821,Intersection of Borel subset with line,"Let $y \in \mathbb{R}$. If $A$ is a Borel subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $$A(y) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}| (x,y) \in A\}$$ is a Borel subset of $\mathbb{R}$. I think that I have to show that $A(y)$ is in Borel-sigma algebra in $\mathbb{R}$. But the sigma algebra itself has no clear form, I mean I just know that it is the sigma algebra generated by all open sets, there is no clear form of its elements. Another thing is I am not sure if Borel ""subset"" means the same as Borel 'set' (which simply mean it is in the Borel sigma algebra). Any idea or hint about how to begin ? It is very good if anyone can list some important steps in proving this statement.","['lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis', 'descriptive-set-theory', 'measure-theory']"
