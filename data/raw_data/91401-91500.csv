1237370,How to calculate MISE - Mean Integrated Squared Error?,"I might have misunderstood something, but it seems like taking a definite integral from expectation or expectation from definite integral. But the first stage will return a number in both cases. I thought that integral under expectation is indefinite, but it looks like just a ""notation"" in many places, because further digging brings negative answer - for example: see § 2.2.4 here But I have only one variable - $x$, and estimated $\hat{f}(x,h)$ and theoretical $f(x)$ functions. Can anyone explain me how to calculate $MISE(h) = E \int_{\mathbb{R}}(\hat{f}(x,h)-f(x))^2dx$ ?

1237376,Directional derivative vs. function restriction and then derivative,"Say I have a function of two variables, and a line in the plane, and I'd like to ""take the derivative along the line"". Is this an indication to use the directional derivative, OR is it expected that I first restrict the function to the line in the plane, so that it's a function of one variable, and then take a derivative in, say, the x variable? And whichever one is the right answer, what is the other option doing then? (this specifically is in relation to a hermite finite element example; the line in question is one side of a triangle, so two points on the line are given (two of the triangle vertices); if the directional derivative is what is in fact meant, then I guess they mean to evaluate it at one of the two points.)","['finite-element-method', 'derivatives']"

1237549,Calculate the ring of integers of quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why is quadratic integer ring defined in that way? (6 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Calculate the ring of integers of quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ Solution: Let $F$ be an algebraic number field. Then an element $b\in F$ is integral iff its monic irreducible polynomial has integer coefficients. For example, $\sqrt{d}$ for integer $d$ is integral. If $d\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ , then the monic irreducible polynomial of $(1+\sqrt{d})/2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2 -x + (1-d)/4 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ , so $(1+\sqrt{d})/2$ is integral. Thus the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ contains the subring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ , and the subring $\mathbb{Z}[(1+\sqrt{d})/2]$ if $d\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ . We show that there are no other integral elements. An element $a+b\sqrt{d}$ with rational $a$ and $b\neq0$ is integral iff its monic irreducible polynomial $x^2 -2ax +(a^2 -db^2)$ belongs to $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . Therefore, $2a$ , $2b$ are integers. If $a=(2k+1)/2$ , for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ , then it is easy to see that $a^2 - db^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ iff $b=(2l+1)/2$ for some $l\in\mathbb{Z}$ , and $(2k+1)^2 - d(2l+1)^2$ is divisible by $4$ . The latter implies that $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $4$ , i.e. $d\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ . In turn, if $d\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ then every element $(2k+1)/2 +(2l+1)\sqrt{d}/2$ is integral. Thus, integral elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ are equal to $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ if $d\not \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ , and $\mathbb{Z}[(1+\sqrt{d})/2]$ if $d\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ . Can someone explain why $\sqrt{d}$ for integer $d$ is integral, and why the monic irreducible polynomial of an integral element $a+b\sqrt{d}$ is of the form $x^2 -2ax +(a^2 -db^2)$ ?","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

1237604,"How to evaluate $\log x$ to high precision ""by hand""","I want to prove $$\log 2<\frac{253}{365}.$$ This evaluates to $0.693147\ldots<0.693151\ldots$, so it checks out. (The source of this otherwise obscure numerical problem is in the verification of the Birthday problem .) If you had to do the calculation by hand, what method or series would you use to minimize the number of operations and/or size of the arguments involved in order to get this result? I'm doing a formal computer proof, so it's not exactly by hand, but I still want to minimize the number of evaluations needed to get to this result. One method is by rewriting it into $2<e^{253/365}$ and using the power series; since it is a positive series you know you can stop once you have exceeded $2$. Working this out, it seems you need the terms $n=0,\dots,7$ of the sum, and then it works out to $$2<\sum_{n=0}^7\frac{(253/365)^n}{n!}=\frac{724987549742673918011}{362492763907870312500},$$ which involves rather larger numbers than I'd like. There is also the limit $(1+\frac{253}{365n})^n\to$ $e^{253/365}$, but the convergence on this is not so good; it doesn't get past $2$ until $n=68551$, at which point we are talking about numbers with $507162$ digits. For $\log 2$ there is of course the terribly converging alternate series $\log 2=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{-(-1)^n}n$, which requires $71339$ terms to get the desired bound. This can be improved by pushing the series into its geometrically convergent region as $\log 2=2\log{\sqrt 2}=-2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(1-\sqrt2)^n}n$, but now there is the added complication of estimating $\sqrt 2$ to sufficient precision. Assuming that $\sqrt 2$ is known exactly, you need to take this series out to $12$ terms, at which point we are verifying $$\frac{1959675656 \sqrt2-2771399891}{1011780}<0\Leftarrow2771399891^2>1959675656^2\cdot 2.$$ What other methods are there to do a calculation like this?

1237647,How many subsets of $S$ are there that contain $x$ but do not contain $y$?,"Let $S$ be a set of size $37$, and let $x$ and $y$ be two distinct elements of $S$. How many subsets of $S$ are there that contain $x$ but do not contain $y$? This question is on a practice exam that I am reviewing for tomorrow. The answer key says that the answer to this question is $2^{37} - 2^{35}$. I fail to see how this is correct as $2^{37}$ would be the amount of all subsets and $2^{35}$ is the amount of subsets containing x and y (I believe), therefore the answer would be the # of subsets that do not contain x or y, which doesn't answer the question. I thought the answer should be $2^{36} - 2^{35}$, where $2^{36}$ is the number of subsets containing $x$, taking away the number of subsets that contain both $x$ and $y$, therefore being left with the number of subsets that contain $x$ and not $y$.

For matrices $A \in M_{n}(\mathbb C), B \in M_{n,m}(\mathbb C), C \in M_{m,n}(\mathbb C)$ and $D \in M_{m}(\mathbb C)$, we define the matrix $P \in M_{m+n}(\mathbb C)$ as
$$P : = \begin{pmatrix}A &B \\
C & D

Give a necessary and sufficient condition that $P$ is unitary. My attempt:
We can find that $$P^* =  \begin{pmatrix}\overline{A^T} &\overline{C^T} \\
\overline{B^T} & \overline{D^T}

Therefore, $P$ is unitary iff $PP*=I_{m+n}$ ($I$ is the identity matrix) iff
$$\begin{pmatrix}A\overline{A^T} +B\overline{B^T}&A\overline{C^T} +B\overline{D^T}\\
C\overline{A^T}+D\overline{B^T} &C\overline{C^T}+ D\overline{D^T}

$$\int_M d \omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega $$ I've read and understood the proof Spivak gives, but I'm unsure about what oriented means. In applications (such as in fluid mechanics), I've sometimes seen that this condition is ignored, or hand-waved over, but it's obviously key. I understand what is meant by an orientation (the fact that any non-zero $\omega \in \Lambda (\mathbb{R}^n)$ splits the bases of a linear space into two groups - those with $\omega(v_1,...,v_n) >0$ and those with $\omega(v_1,...,v_n) <0$, and these two groups are orientations for $V$), but I don't see how I would verify that a given manifold-with-boundary is oriented (other than it having something to do with the orientation of the tangent space). To make things more concrete, I know (i.e. have it on good authority) that the Möbius Band is not oriented. However, I know that the 2-sphere is oriented.

It says that the desired operator can be defined as   $U'=U\otimes I$, where the identity is defined only on $V \perp W$.

I'm pretty sure that $(a_1,\cdots,a_n,\alpha)\mapsto a_n\alpha^n+\cdots+a_1\alpha+a_0$ plus implicit function theorem will work. But it didn't came to my mind. Instead, I thought that the coefficients are $C^\infty$ function of the roots by Vietta Theorem . So I hoped the map $\psi:(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)\mapsto(a_0,\cdots,a_{n-1})$ has a full rank derivative at the current roots and start to apply Inverse function Theorem to conclude that, locally, $(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)$ is $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism map of $(a_1,\cdots,a_n)$. Hence, I conjectured the following proposition : Conjecture. We know by Vietta's Theorem that :

Is it a famous matrix ? Is this conjecture correct for general $n$? Proof for $n=2$ and $n=3$ : n=2 :$\quad D_{(\alpha,\beta)}\psi=\left[\begin{matrix}
\beta&\alpha\\
-1&-1
\end{matrix}\right]$. So, $\boxed{\det(D_{\alpha,\beta}\psi)=0 \leftrightarrow \alpha=\beta\rightarrow\bot}$ n=3 $ :\quad D_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}\psi=\left[\begin{matrix}
-\beta\gamma&-\alpha\gamma&-\alpha\beta\\
\beta+\gamma&\alpha+\gamma&\alpha+\beta\\
-1&-1&-1
\end{matrix}\right]
$. Now by computing determinant respect to the last row: $\begin{align}
\det(D_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}\psi)= +\big[-\alpha^2\gamma-\alpha\beta\gamma+\alpha^2\beta+\alpha\beta\gamma\big]&-\big[-\alpha\beta\gamma-\beta^2\gamma+\alpha\beta^2+\alpha\beta\gamma\big]\\
&-\big[-\alpha\beta\gamma-\beta\gamma^2+\alpha\beta\gamma+\alpha\gamma^2\big]
\end{align}$.
$$\Rightarrow\det(D_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}\psi)=
[\alpha-\beta]\color{red}{\gamma^2}+[\beta^2-\alpha^2]\color{red}{\gamma}+[\alpha\beta(\alpha-\beta)] $$
Now the equation $\det(D_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}\psi)=0$, while $\alpha\neq\beta$, becomes the following quadratic equation respect to $\gamma$ :
$$\boxed{(\gamma-\alpha)(\gamma-\beta)=\color{red}{\gamma^2}-(\alpha+\beta)\color{red}{\gamma}+\alpha\beta=0

Define the direct limit presheaf by $U \to \varinjlim \cal{F}_i $. In general this is just a presheaf. If $X$ is noetherian it is a sheaf, and this is the result I want to prove. My attemp: I tried to prove the first axiom of sheaves (I suspect that the second will need similar arguments). Let be an open set $U$ and an open cover $\{ V_i \}_i$ of $U$. Since $X$ is noetherian it can be can supposed that the cover is finite. Let $s \in \varinjlim \cal{F_i(U)}$ such that $s|_{V_i}=0 \quad \forall i$. The goal is to show that then $s=0$. Being $s \in \varinjlim \cal{F_i(U)}$, we know that there exists some $j / \quad s=f_j(U)(t_j)$ for some $t_j \in \cal{F}_j(U)$ ($f_i(U)$ are the morphisms of the direct limit of the abealian groups $\cal{F}_i(U)$ ). I can consider the germs ${t_j}_{V_i}$. If I could show that $s|_{V_i}=0 \Rightarrow {t_j}_{V_i}=0$ then the problem would be done, because the $\cal{F}_i$ are sheaves, in particular they verify the first axiom of sheaves, so $t_j=0$ and then $s=f_j(t_j)=0$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

1238534,"Is ""imposing"" one function onto another ever used in mathematics?","First of all, let me define what I mean by ""imposing,"" and let me clarify that I've only studied this operation in 2D Euclidean space. Now then, to impose one function onto another, you need two things: A function upon which to impose, called the receiver . A function to impose, called the imposer . Now, let me first explain the concept generally. The idea is that, rather than graphing some function with respect to the x-axis, we treat the receiver as the x-axis, graphing the imposer with respect to receiver . So, what do I mean by ""graphing some function with respect to the x-axis?"" Well, first we'll let $p_0$ be the point on the x-axis at some $x$, and we'll let $l$ be the line which is normal to the x-axis at $p_0$. It should be clear that $p_0=(x,0)$ and that $l$ is a vertical line which passes through $p_0$. Then, for some function $g$, let $p_1$ be the point on $l$ whose distance is equal to $g(x)$. It should be clear that $p_1=(x,g(x))$ since the distance from $(x,0)$ to $(x,g(x))$ is equal to $g(x)$. If you do the previous procedure for all $x$ and plot every $p_1$ on a graph, you will have successfully graphed $g$ with respect to the x-axis. So, to reiterate my second paragraph, the idea is that we can graph any function with respect to some other function. The way we do this is by following the same procedure we used in the last paragraph. However, there are two main differences: Instead of letting $p_0$ be the point on the x-axis at some $x$, we let $p_0$ be the point on some parametric function $f(t)$, the receiver , for some $t$. Instead of letting $l$ be the line which is normal to the x-axis at $p_0$, we let $l$ be the line which is normal to $f$, the receiver , at $p_0$. For example, this is $g(t)=cos(t)$, the imposer , imposed upon $f(t)=(t,a \cdot sin(t))$, the receiver , where $a$ is simply a real value which oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ with time. Basically, $a$ is the reason functions below are moving. The black function which resembles a standing wave , as I said before, is an oscillating sine function, and it is also the receiver . The blue function which, if you look closely, occasionally looks like a cosine function is the function resulting from imposing $g(t)$ onto $f(t)$. The green line segments are to illustrate the act of finding the point on the normal of $f(t)$ at $t$ with a distance of $g(t)$, like we covered in the above paragraphs. If you're interested, here's the raw math to impose one function onto another: Given some parametric equation $f:f(t) = (x(t),y(t))$ upon which we wish to impose some function $g(t)$: $$
Let\;h(t)=\frac{\frac{d}{dt}(y(t))}{\frac{d}{dt}(x(t))}=f'(t)
$$
$$
Let\;j(t)=tan^{-1}(h(t))\pm\frac{\pi}{2}
$$
Then $g$ imposed upon $f$ becomes the following parametric equation, in terms of $t$.
$$
(g(t)cos(j(t))+x(t),g(t)sin(j(t))+y(t))
$$ I feel as though I should clarify now that, for most $f$ and $g$, this operation will produce two resultant functions. This fact is a result of the way I have defined this operation. That is, we are looking for any point $p_1$ on the normal line of $f$ at $p_0$ such that the distance between $p_0$ and $p_1$ is equal to $g(t)$. Put more simply, we're looking on a line for a point which is a specific distance away from another point on the line. We already know that, for any point $p$ on a line $l$, there will always be exactly two points on $l$ with a distance $\delta$ away from $p$, for all $\delta > 0$. This fact is the reason for which we are adding or subtracting $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $j$. The only case I can think of wherein this operation does not produce two resultant functions is when $g(t) = 0$, as each resulting function will be exactly equal to the parametric $f(t)$; however, there very well may be more. So, ignoring any incorrect notation or terminology I might have used, is this type of transformation used anywhere in mathematics? If so, could you show me where I could get some more information on it?","['graphing-functions', 'parametric', 'calculus']"

Since $C_{n} \in$ Int$(C_{n+1})$ for $\forall n \ge 1 $ and $X = \cup_{n≥1}C_n$ Then $x \in C_{i}$ for some $i \ge 1 \implies x \in C_i \subseteq$ Int$(C_{i+1}) \subseteq C_{i+1}$.

My attempt at the problem: I have a hunch that it might be true. For any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a continuous surjection $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]^k$, which can be realized with a space filling curve. Therefore, any finite-dimensional cube can be realized as the continuous image of $[0,1]$. Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be compact and path-connected. My friend suggested that it would suffice to show that $K$ has the structure of a CW-complex with a finite number of cells, and then use the fact that any finite-dimensional cube is realized as the continuous image of $[0,1]$.

1238669,Separable ODE and singular solutions,"In most introductory ODE textbooks we can find the following definition: A separable first-order ODE is the one of the form $$y'=g(x)h(y)$$ and if $h(y)\neq0$, then the general solution is found by integration (using chain rule). Next, we must find every $y_0$ such that $h(y_0)=0$ and the constant function $y=y_0$ satisfies the above ODE (called singular solutions). I'm trying to learn this method in a rigorous way by using the existence and uniqueness of solution theorems and adding restrictions over $g$ and $h$, but can't deal with the following: Does there exist a solution $f$ defined in some $A\in \mathbb{R}$ such that there exists $x_0\in A$ such that $h(f(x_0))=0 $ but $f$ is not constant?

Can you name a categorical property of $\mathsf{Ban}_1$ which is useful in practice, but which is not satisfied by $\mathsf{NormVect}_1$? Background: There is a branch called categorical Banach space theory, and I really wonder why there one does not consider the larger category of all normed vector spaces somehow as a first approximation. In functional analysis it is well-known that (and why) Banach spaces are more useful than normed vector spaces. I would like to know if or why this is also true for the corresponding categories. $^{\dagger}$ Notice that the subscript $1$ indicates that we restrict ourselves to short linear maps, which is quite important for having the mentioned categorical properties.

$ h_{1}k_{1}h_{2}k_{2} = h_{1}h_{2}k_{1}k_{2}$ and therefore $hk = kh$ for each $h \in H$, $k \in K$. Is there a better way of saying this? How do I obtain a characterization of when $HK \cong H\times K$? Here I just picked a map (albeit canonical) and worked out when it would be an isomorphism. What if some other map works?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

this a basic fact that I don't understand or is it an example of something
more advanced ? Also, I don't understand figure 22.4, I think that a saturated set
is either contained in $\{(x,y)\mid x^{2}+y^{2}<1\}$ or contains
$S^{1}$and I don't see how this is described in the image, can someone please explain that ?","['quotient-spaces', 'general-topology']"
1239267,f continuously differentiable implies f is Lipschitz on compact subsets,"It is a more general form of the question here , only here $U$ is not a convex set but an open and connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. I need to show that $f$ is $M$ Lipschitz on any compact $K \subset U$. My attempt goes like this: $U$ is an open connected set, and $K \subset U$ so for any two points $x,y \in K$ there is a finite set of points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{r}\in K$ and we'll denote $x_1:=x, x_r:=y$ so for every $i=2,3,...,r$ the straight segment $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ is contained by $K$. By the mean value theorem for several variables , $\forall i=2,3,...,r:\ \lvert f(x_{i-1})-f(x_i) \rvert= \lVert f'(s_i) ( x_{i-1} - x_i ) \rVert$ when $s_i\in U$. Notice that since $s_i ,\ i=2,3,...,r$ is finite thus bounded, $f'$ exists and continuous - thus $\exists T := \max_{i=1,2,..,r} \{ \lVert f'(s_i) \rVert \}$, and because $K$ is compact, $\exists D:= \ diam \{ K \} \geq \max_{i=2,3,...,r} \{ \lVert x_{i-1} -x_i \rVert \}$ hence:
$$\lvert f(x)-f(y) \rvert=\lvert f(x_{1})-f(x_2) +f(x_2)-f(x_3)+.... +f(x_{r-1})-f(y)\rvert \leq  TB\cdot r$$ and since the diameter of $K$ is finite, every $x \neq y \ \in K$ have a real positive number $t$ so that $\lVert x-y \rVert \cdot t = B$ and that gives $||f(x)-f(y)|| \leq T \cdot t \cdot||x-y||$. Is it o.k?","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'multivariable-calculus']"
1239268,Multiples of some set has density,"Nathanson gives a proof in Elementary Methods in Number Theory (Theorem 7.14) that, if a set $S$ of positive integers has
$$
\sum_{s\in S}\frac1s<+\infty
$$
then the set of positive multiples of $S$ has a natural density, i.e.,
$$
\lim_{x\to+\infty}\frac{|\{m\in M(S):\ m\le x\}|}{x}
$$
exists. I'd like to cite this result; does anyone know when it was first stated or proved? (""As far as I know Nathanson was first"" would be a valid answer.) Edit: Hall ( Sets of Multiples ) states that this is the best possible result in the sense that for any $\xi(x)\to+\infty$ there are sets $S$ with
$$
\sum_{s\in S,s\le x}\frac1s<\xi(x)
$$
for which the set of multiples of $S$ does not have a density. But I'm still looking for a reference on the original.","['number-theory', 'limsup-and-liminf', 'reference-request']"
1239279,basic question about holonomy,"I'm struggling to understand how conditions on the metric put conditions on the holonomy group and vice-versa. My understanding is that the holonomy principle says that there's a one-to-one correspondence between parallel tensors, constant tensors (i.e. with $\nabla S=0$), and elements of the fibre $E_p$ preserved under the holonomy group. I'm trying to understand the 2 following examples: If $(M,g)$ is a manifold and we have a complex structure $J_p:T_pM\to T_pM$ such that $J_p$ is invariant under the holonomy group, I've read that in order to extend $J$ to the whole manifold we need Hol$(g)\subset U(n)$. Why? Isn't all we need that $P_\gamma(J_p)=J_p$. I know that $U(n)=GL(n,\mathbb{C})\cap O(2n)$. So why is the condition $P_\gamma(J_p)=J_p$ equivalent to $P_\gamma$ commuting with $J$ and preserving $g$? The other example is showing that Hol$(g)\subset SO(n)$ if and only if $M$ is orientable. So to use the holonomy principle, start with non-zero $\alpha_p\in \Lambda^n(T^\ast_pM)$. We want $\alpha_p$ to be preserved under Hol$(g)$ so that it can be extended, by the holonomy principle, to a nowhere vanishing form. Again, we just need $\alpha_p$ to be fixed by the holonomy group. How does this happen if and only if the group is contained in SO$(n)$. I apologize for asking 2 questions but I feel the concept I am missing is the same in both. Thanks very much.","['holonomy', 'differential-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds']"

1239368,Computing an integral using residues,"I am trying to find an integral: $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{-\sqrt{(x^2 + 1)}}}{(x^2 + 1)^2}\,\mathrm dx$$ I went about applying contour integral over a semicircle with diameter along $ x = +\infty$ to  $- \infty $ enclosing the pole at  $x = +i $.  The residue is $(-i/2)$ as shown here. So the integral should be $(2\pi i)\times (-i/2)=\pi$ However since it is a well behaved function if I do a quick numerical integration in Mathematica it is giving me a value of $0.475$ A plot confirms that the function converges very fast.

1239374,If $n\le |f(1/n)|\le n^{3/2}$ then prove that $f$ has a simple pole at $z=0$,"Let, $f:\{z\in \mathbb C:0<|z|<1\}\to \mathbb C$ be analytic such that $n\le |f(1/n)|\le n^{3/2}$ for $n=2,3,...$. Assume that $z^2f(z)$ is bounded in $|z|<1$. Show that $f$ has a pole of order $1$ at $z=0$. My Attempt: First I consider $g(z)=z^2f(z)$.  So $g$ has zero of order $2$ at $z=0$. Also $g(z)$ is analytic in $|z|<1$. Also $|g(z)|\le M$ for all $z$ in $|z|<1$. So applying Schwartz lemma , $|g'(0)|\le 2M$ and $|g(z)|\le M|z|^2$. Now if we can find $z_0 (\not =0)$ in $|z|<1$ such that one of these inequalities hold then we can find $g$ explicitly..... But I could not show it...
