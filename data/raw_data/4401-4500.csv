32279,The Frattini subgroup contains a power of a certain subgroup,"This is from an article by Hall from 1961; it's probably one of the most trivial observations in that article, but I can't get the reasoning. Let G be some group and let A be a normal abelian p-subgroup of G for some prime p. We want to show that $A^p$, the subgroup of p-th powers of elements of A, is contained in the Frattini subgroup of G. So let M be a maximal subgroup in G which doesn't contain A and denote $N=M\cap A$. I have managed to show that N is normal in G and that A/N is a minimal normal subgroup of G/N. So
A/N can't have any nontrivial proper characteristic subgroups. Therefore $A^pN=N$, in which case we are done, or $A^pN=A$. I don't know where to go from here. I suppose the fact that A is a p-group should come into play somewhere, since all of the above works for any exponent n instead of p.",['group-theory']
32286,Choosing the branch of a logarithm,"The problem: I am integrating complex logarithms over an angle $\phi$ over $[0,2\pi]$. It is quite complex (pun not intended) and I called Mathematica in to aid me. I am calculating an energy of a system (which must be real-valued) and getting a complex result. The integration (done by Mathematica, which formally chooses the logarithm's branch cut as $]-\infty,0]$) yields $2\pi (i \pi + 3 \ln{(-r)})$ With that branch cut, $\ln{(-r)} = \ln{|r|} + i\pi, (r>0)$, which results in a remaining imaginary term. The question I have is: is it allowed to ""re-choose"" the logarithms branch cut when evaluating the seemingly independent problem of evaluating the logarithm of a negative number, just so, that instead of a imaginary $i\pi$, I get $-i\pi/3$, nicely cancelling with the other term in the expression? In other words: is the integration independent of the choice of the branch cut in the sense that the branch cut can be changed afterwards? Alternatively, how would I go about calculating the integral with another branch cut (the one I want), so I can see if the ""better"" branch cut gives a real result? Thanks! UPDATE: Here's the integrand itself: $$\int_\xi^R \rho d\rho \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \frac{1}{\rho^2} \frac{4\rho^2+r^2-4r\rho \cos{\phi}}{\rho^2 +r^2-2r\rho \cos{\phi}}$$ Splitting in partial fractions and calculating the integral over $\rho$ gives you $$\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \left[ \ln{\left|\frac{R}{\xi}\right|} + \frac{2e^{2i\phi}-1}{e^{2i\phi}-1} \left( \ln{(R-r e^{i\phi})}-\ln{(\xi-r e^{i\phi})} \right) + \frac{e^{2i\phi}-2}{e^{2i\phi}-1} \left( \ln{(R-r e^{-i\phi})}-\ln{(\xi-re^{-i\phi})} \right)  \right]$$ This last one evaluates to the above complex expression after a call to Integrate[...,{$\phi$,0,2$\pi$}] in Mathematica, if I make the physical assumption that $\xi << r << R$.","['logarithms', 'complex-analysis', 'mathematica']"
32294,A question on notation: What does $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ mean?,"I sort of asked a version of this question before and it was unclear; try I will now to make an honest attempt to state everything clerly. I am trying to evaluate the following, namely $\nabla w = \nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$, where $\vec{a}$ is a constant vector and $\vec{r}$ is the vector $<x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n>$. Now say that I use the chain rule, first say by setting $\vec{u}$ to be equal to the cross product of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{r}$. Now here's the part that I'm confused. How do we extend the chain rule over when dealing with the gradient? Do I take $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ to be equal to $\nabla |\vec{u}|^n$ $\times$ $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$, where $\times$ denotes the cross product? The first bit $\nabla |\vec{u}|^n$ is easy, it just evaluates to $n|\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^{n-2} (\vec{a} \times \vec {r})$, remembering that $\vec{u} = \vec{a} \times \vec{r}$. I am guessing that $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ $\neq$ $\nabla |\vec{u}|^n$ $\times$ $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$,
as to even speak about $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$, i.e. the gradient of a vector we would have to talk about either the cross product or dot product of the gradient and $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$ By the way, I am told the answer given is $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ = $n|\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^{n-2} \Big(\vec{a} \times (\vec{r} \times \vec{a})\Big)$. So let's say that I try a component wise approach, i.e. we look first at $\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}$. Then is it true (I could be wrong) that: $\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1} = n|\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^{n-2} \quad \vec{u_1} \times \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \Big(\vec{a} \times \vec{r}\Big) = n|\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^{n-2} \quad \vec{u_1} \times  \Big(\vec{a} \times \frac{\partial\vec{r}}{\partial x_1}\Big)$, as $\vec{a}$ is a constant vector? Here $\vec{u_1}$ denotes the first component of the vector $\vec{a} \times \vec{r}$. I would really aprreciate an interpretation of this, it is just that I am confused about what to take and the meanings of these operations.","['notation', 'multivariable-calculus']"
32305,Can this circulant determinant be zero?,"The question is: If $a,b,c$ are negative distinct real numbers,then the determinant $$ \begin{vmatrix}

b & c & a\\ 
c & a & b
\end{vmatrix} $$ is $$(a) \le 0 \quad (b) \gt 0 \quad (c) \lt 0 \quad (d) \ge 0 $$ My strategy: I identifed that the matrix is a circulant hence the determinant can be expressed in the form of $-(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc)$ which implies that $-(a+b+c)\frac{1}{2}[(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2]$ hence $(-)(-)(+) \gt 0$ but the answers says it is $\ge 0$, so can we have three $a,b,c$ such that the answer is $0$ ?","['linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
32314,Diophantine impossibility and irrationality (or similar),"The Diophantine equation $$a^2 = 2 b^2$$ having no solutions is the same as $\sqrt{2}$ being irrational.

32331,Lifting of a tangent bundle,"I have a problem with Kuranishi's theorem in deformation theory. I'll try to formulate it in general terms, and then describe the particular situation. Let $\pi : M \to S$ be a smooth fiber bundle - i.e. $M$ and $S$ are smooth manifolds, and $\pi$ is a surjective submersion. There is an associated surjective morphism of vector bundles $ \pi_* : T_M \to \pi^* T_S$. I want to find a lifting of $\pi^* T_S$ into $T_M$. Suppose I can find a smooth map $f : S \to M$ which satisfies $\pi \circ f = id_S$. This induces an injective map $T_S \to f^*T_M$. Can I lift this to a map $\pi^* T_S \to T_M$? How about if some extra data is given, like a metric on $S$, or a family of metrics $g_s$ on the fibers $T_M |_{M_s}$ (where $s$ is a parameter in $S$)? Basically I'm trying to use Kuranishi's theorem to get something like Siu's canonical lifts. In this situation $M$ is the product of a fixed smooth manifold and the space of its complex structures, and $S$ is a complex manifold (open ball, even). The map $\pi$ is the passing to the quotient by the action of the group of diffeomorphisms. If we fix a hermitian metric $h$ on $M_0$, then Kuranishi gives a map $f : S \to M$ which satisfies the above hypothesis. I'm told that Kuranishi should induce a lifting of $\pi^*T_S$ into $T_M$, but I can't seem to figure out how.","['differential-topology', 'complex-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

32358,Why is $z = x+iy \mapsto x$ not differentiable in $0 \in \mathbb{C}$?,"Today we had an online-test and one of the question was whether the function
$$z = x+iy \mapsto x$$
is differentiable in $0 \in \mathbb{C}$. I thought I'd check it using our definition of complex differentiability and I came to the conclusion, that
$$\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{\Re(z)}{z}=1.$$
I even checked it via wolframalpha afterwards and it told me so as well. However, this was considered to be wrong, because apparently the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not fulfilled, that is to say
$$1 = \partial_x \Re f(0) \neq \partial_y \Im f(0)=0.$$
First, I checked wikipedia to find out what these equations looked like and I found that indeed, ""a complex function is differentiable in a point"" is equivalent to ""a complex function fulfils the Cauchy-Riemann equations"".

32417,Spectrum of the right shift operator on $\ell^2({\bf Z})$,"Here is the question : Considering the right shift operator $S$ on $\ell^2({\bf Z})$, what can one know about ran$(S-\lambda)$? Here is what I thought: If one wants to prove that the operator $S-\lambda$ is onto when $\lambda$ satisfies some conditions, does one have to construct the solution? One needs to find the solution $(S-\lambda)x=y$ where $x,y\in \ell^2({\bf Z})$. Using the standard basis $e_n=(\delta_{nk})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$, one has to solve
$\lambda x_{k}-x_{k-1}=y_{k}, (k\in {\bf Z})$. Intuitively, when $|\lambda|=1$, there may be no way for $S-\lambda:\ell^2({\bf Z})\to \ell^2({\bf Z})$ to be onto. However, when $|\lambda|\neq 1$, can one explicitly find $x=(x_{k})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$?

Hence to find $W$, we only need to find {$w_0,...,w_k$}. I guess that $w_m$ can be written as following ($c_0$ is a constant): $$w_m = c_0\sum_{l=0}^k \alpha_{k,m,l} \binom{L}{l} $$
for $k=1,2,3,4$ and $m=0,1,..,k$ and $l=0,1,..,k$, I have numerically calculated the value for $\alpha_{k,m,l}$, which is given as the above matrices. The question is what $\alpha_{k,m,l}$ is for general k. EDIT: also see here for a solution to eigen decomposition by Siva.

$$w_m=\frac{(-1)^{m}}{2^{L}\binom{L}{k-m}}\frac{L-k}{L-k+m}\sum_{t=0}^{k-m}\binom{L}{t} =\frac{{k-L \choose m}}{2^{L}\binom{L}{k} \binom{k}{m}} \sum_{t=0}^{k-m}\binom{L}{t}$$ For interested readers, this solution is described in Robust k-mer frequency estimation using gapped k-mers .

My guess is that $c_0^{-1}=2^L\binom{L}{k}$. Also $\alpha_{k,m,l}$ is a function of $k,m$ and $l$ and most likely symmetric in $l$ and $m$ as the above examples suggest.","['power-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'linear-algebra', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

I'm in a first year single variable Calculus course; here are a few limits. $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\tan(3x^2) + \sin^2(5x)}{x^2}$$ $$\lim_{x \to 3^+} \frac{\sqrt{x - 3}}{|x - 3|}$$ $$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - \sqrt{x}}{x - 1}$$","['calculus', 'limits']"

32542,How can we prove a simple case of the High Indices Theorem?,"Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of real numbers such that $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n x^{2^n}$$ converges for $|x| < 1$ and $f(x)$ converges to $a$ as $x \to 1^{-}$ . Then I have to prove that $\sum a_n$ exists and is equal to $a$ . (This is a particular instance of so called High Indices Theorem, which was originally proved by Hardy and Littlewood.) Here, we are given a hint that, assuming $\sum a_n = a \ (A)$ , we have $\sum a_n = a$ if and only if $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k a_k = 0.$$ This is not hard to prove, by comparing the difference between the partial sum $s_N$ and $p_N = \sum a_n e^{-n/N}$ . The result follows once we show that $a_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ . But I failed to make any useful estimation except for a trivial bound $a_n \ll_{\varepsilon}(1+\varepsilon)^{2^n}$ obtained by considering the radius of convergence of $f$ , and this is obviously of no use.

For example, as the sequence continues, the ratio of $\frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}}$ converges to $\tau=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, a ratio which can be used to describe a number of numerical relationships in nature. From some quick Wikipedia browsing, we can find a number of Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers . For one abstract generalization, we can define Fibonacci-like sequences as follows: An $n$-order Fibonacci-like sequence is generated by $F_n=\sum_{i=1}^{n}F_{n-i}$ with $n$ initial terms. Thus, the Fibonacci sequence is such a sequence with $n=2$ and $F_0=0$ and $F_1=1$ Using this basic generalization, we have Lucas Numbers , where $n=2$ and $F_0=2$ and $F_1=1$, whose consecutive-number ratio also converges to the golden ratio. There are also Tribonacci, Tetranacci, and n-nacci numbers , which follow this generalization for 3, 4, and n numbers, and pad the initializing values with 0s, e.g. $F_0=0$ ... $F_{n-2}=0$, $F_{n-1}=1$.

32689,Isomorphism between $I_G/I_G^2$ and $G/G'$,"Ok, this has been bugging me for a while, and I'm sure there's something obvious I'm missing. The references I've looked at for this result in an effort to resolve the issue didn't address it. $G$ is a group, $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ its integral group ring, $I_G$ the augmentation ideal (i.e. the kernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}[G]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ sending all group elements to 1), and $G/G'$ is the abelianization of $G$. I'm attempting to show that $I_G/I_G^2$ is isomorphic to $G/G'$. It's straightforward to show that 
$$(g-1)+(h-1)\equiv(gh-1)\bmod I_G^2\hskip0.5in(*)$$
and thus every equivalence class mod $I_G^2$ is equal to some $(g-1)+I_G^2$. Now all we have to do is define a map $\phi:G/G'\rightarrow I_G/I_G^2$ and show that it has an inverse $\psi:I_G/I_G^2\rightarrow G/G'$. The definitions are obvious enough:
$$\phi(gG')=(g-1)+I_G^2$$
$$\psi((g-1)+I_G^2)=gG'$$
and starred equation shows that these are homomorphisms. But! My problem is showing that these maps are well-defined. For example, if $(g-1)+I_G^2=(h-1)+I_G^2$, i.e. $$(g-1)-(h-1)\equiv (gh^{-1}-1)\equiv0\bmod I_G^2,$$ 
we need to show that $$\psi((g-1)+I_G^2)=gG'=hG'=\psi((h-1)+I_G^2),$$ i.e. $gh^{-1}\in G'$. If we have $gh^{-1}\in G'$, i.e. $gh^{-1}$ equals some $\prod_{a,b\in G} (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n_{a,b}}$, then
$$gh^{-1}-1=\left(\prod_{a,b\in G} (aba^{-1}b^{-1})^{n_{a,b}}\right)-1,$$

32692,Explicitly reconstructing a function from its moments,"Let $f$ be an integrable real valued function defined on $[0,\infty)$.  Let $$m_n=\int_0^\infty f(x)x^n \mathrm dx$$ be the $n^{th}$ moment, and suppose that all of these integrals converge absolutely.  Are there conditions that can we impose on $f$ that would allow us to write $f$ explicitly in terms of its moments and certain simple functions. This idea is similar to the fact that we can reconstruct sufficiently nice functions on $[0,1]$ from a sum of their Fourier coefficients and $e^{inx}$.  Also, on $(-\infty,\infty)$ we can reconstruct $f$ from an integral over the real line. The analogy for $[0,\infty)$ and $x^s$ is of course the Mellin transform, which has an inversion formula as a line integral in the complex plane. My question is then: Can we impose nice enough (non-trivial) conditions on a class of functions so that we can invert the Mellin transform on the real line based only on its values at the positive integers?

32706,the localization of a ring is an integral domain iff the annihilators of zero divisors are comaximal ideals,"I would appreciate any help with the following problem. let $R$ be a commutative ring (with $1$).

Clearly, i) implies ii), and I showed that ii) implies iii). If iii) were false, then we can find $x,y \in R$ with $xy = 0$ and $Ann(x) + Ann(y) \subset M$ for some maximal ideal $M$. Then, in $R_M$ we have $\frac{xy}{1} = \frac{0}{1}$. Now, we are assuming that $R_M$ is an integral domain, hence either $\frac{x}{1} = \frac{0}{1}$ or $\frac{y}{1} = \frac{0}{1}$. Therefore, there exist $s,t \in R-M$ such that either $sx = 0$ or $ty = 0$. But $sx = 0$ means that $s \in Ann(x)$, hence $s \in M$, which contradicts the fact that $s \in R-M$. Similarly, $ty = 0$ leads to a contradiction. So ii) implies iii). I am having problems proving that iii) implies i). Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ and suppose that $\frac{x}{s} \cdot \frac{y}{t} =\frac{0}{1}$. This means that there exists $z \in R-P$ with $zxy = 0$.

32806,Rotate a 2D subspace in 4 or more dimensions,"Two non-co-linear vectors define a 2D subspace that passes through the origin. In 3D, you can represent a 2D subspace by its Normal.  It's very easy to define the angle between the two planes: $\theta = \cos^{-1}(N_1\cdot N_2)$ (assuming unit length) and it's a simple matter to find a new plane ""in between"" by interpolating to find a new normal: $N_t = \frac{\sin((1-t)\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}N_1 + \frac{\sin(t\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}N_2$.  Essentially, we're rotating the new Normal vector within the 2D sub-surface defined by the two original Normals. Rotating a vector this way extends easily into higher dimensions, but a Normal defines a hyper-plane, not a linear, 2D subspace.  So I can't use the same approach.  If I have two pairs of orthogonal vectors defining two distinct linear 2d subspaces, is there a way to measure the angle between them or find a new subspace that is an interpolation between the two? Edit: Working with the problem, I realized that even in 3D, interpolating the normals wouldn't be sufficient for my problem, but I would actually need to interpolate the space defined by the vector pairs.  It's still straightforward to do in 3D.  Referring to the image below, if I have vectors $X$ and $Y$ and wish to interpolate to $X'$ and $Y'$, it's simple if I find vectors $Z$ and $Z'$ by the cross-product approach.  Then we can find $F = \left[X\ Y\ Z\right]$ and $F'=\left[X'\ Y'\ Z'\right]$.  The rotation matrix making the full transform from $F$ to $F'$ would just be $F'F^T$.  From that rotation matrix, it's easy to extract the axis and angle of rotation and then simply interpolate through the angle. In higher dimensions, cross-product doesn't work.  However, we can still find a point in terms of the first frame of reference and project it into the second: $P(1) = \left[X'(X\cdot P(0) + Y'(Y\cdot P(0))\right]$.  Given any pair of $P(0)$ and $P(1)$, I can use spherical interpolation find a point on the shortest arc between the two points, but that's not what I need.  I need to interpolate the 2D space itself and find the corresponding point within the plane.  If I need to add any number of extra axes because there are multiple equally short paths, that's fine.","['geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'rotations']"

I have heard that there are some powerful tools from commutative geometry being applied to topology (correct me if I'm wrong of course) like Andre-Quillen Cohomology, and I remember once seeing a talk about applying some ideas from model theory to commutative algebra (something like applying model theory to put upper bounds on Betti numbers of Cohen-Macaulay rings?).  So I'm just wondering if any of these foundational ideas are ever relevant (in the non-obvious ways, i.e. we can't do math without foundations) to these other subjects.","['set-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'model-theory']"
33006,Relation between the Dedekind Zeta Function and Quadratic Reciprocity,"I was trying to learn a little about the Dedekind zeta function . The first place I looked at was obviously the Wikipedia article above. So my question comes from a sentence by the end of the article in the section on relations to other L-functions . That section states that if you have an abelian extension $K/\mathbb{Q} \,$, then the Dedekind zeta function of $K$ is a product of Dirichlet L-functions . In particular it states that if $K$ is a quadratic field, then the ratio $$\frac{\zeta_K (s)}{\zeta(s)} = L(s, \chi)$$ or equivalently, that $$\zeta_K (s) = \zeta(s) L(s, \chi)$$ where $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann zeta function and $L(s, \chi) \,$ is the Dirichlet L-function associated to the Dirichlet character defined by the Jacobi symbol as follows. If $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \,$, and $D$ is the discriminant of this number field, then $$\chi(n) := \left ( \frac{D}{n} \right )$$ Then the Wikipedia article says the following: That the zeta function of a quadratic field is a product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function is an analytic formulation of the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss. This is were I was absolutely amazed, because even though I've seen in the past that the existence of the Euler product for the Riemann zeta function is equivalent to the unique factorization property of the integers, which apparently is also reflected more generally in the context of Dedekind zeta functions and number fields, this time realized as the unique factorization of ideals into products of prime ideals, I just find marvelous that these two things can be equivalent (in some sense which I don't know yet). So my question is why is this analytic fact about the Dedekind zeta function of a quadratic number field, $$\zeta_K (s) = \zeta(s) L(s, \chi)$$ an analytic reformulation of the quadratic reciprocity law? And maybe if it is possible, to push it a little bit further, are there analogues of this, say for higher reciprocity laws, like for cubic or biquadratic reciprocity? Or is this a ""peculiarity"" that occurs just for quadratic fields? Thank you very much for any help.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
33009,How can I get better at this certain kind of probability problem?,"I'm studying for an onsite interview with Google for a product manager position. While looking at interview questions online, I've realized that I really need to brush up on the probability and statistics that I once knew well in college -- marbles, cards, dice, etc. I'm expecting questions like this one: If the probability of observing a car in 30 minutes on a highway is 0.95, what is the probability of observing a car in 10 minutes (assuming constant default probability)? What's a good way to find a lot of problems at this level? I'd like to try to do several per day between now and the interview (which is a couple weeks away). Are there any good books of problems like this? I don't think I need to study permutations/combinations or types of distributions or anything like that, so a general prob/stat textbook isn't really what I need. I don't really know how to characterize those problems well enough to search for them. Thanks!","['statistics', 'probability']"
33026,Controlling the Size of an Open Cover of a Set of Measure Zero,"Suppose we have a subset $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ of Lebesgue measure zero contained in a compact interval, say $[0,1]$.  We know that since $A$ has measure zero we can cover $A$ with a countable set of open intervals, say $\{U_i\}$, such that $\mu(\cup_iU_i)\leq \varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon$.  Now, if we fix some $\varepsilon>0$, can we cover $A$ with a countable set of open intervals, say now $\{V_i\}$, such that $\mu(V_i)\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{2^i}$ for each $i$?  That is, can we control the size of each individual set in some way? I have been thinking about this for a bit, and keep running into having to do things an infinite number of times, or having to choose the wrong indices first.  Any ideas?

33029,What is the formula for add/removing compound and non-compound tax from a value?,"I had posted this question on stack overflow because I am trying to implement a method that will loop through a set of percentages and add or remove them to a value based on some properties that are set.  Here is a link to the question.  I believe I have the compounding part correct. I partially have the non-compounding part, the problem is that I need to add just 1 to the very end instead of every time through the loop.  The other issue I am facing is how do I mix compounding and non-compounding in the formula.  Basically, I have the following scenarios: All percentages are compounded and removed from the total. All percentages are non-compounded and removed from the total. All percentages are compounded and added to the total. All percentages are non-compounded and added to the total. All percentages are compounded, but some are removed and some are added. All percentages are non-compounded, but some are removed and some are added. Some percentages are compounded and some are non-compounded, but they are all added. Some percentages are compounded and some are non-compounded, but they are all removed. Some percentages are compounded and some are non-compounded, and they could be removed or added. I believe I covered everything. Thanks for the help",['algebra-precalculus']
33033,Solving differential equation,"Below is my work for a particular problem that is mixing me up, since no matter how many times, I can't get my answer to match the book solution. Given ${f}''(x)= x^{-\frac{3}{2}}$ where $f'(4)= 2$ and $f(0)= 0$, solve the differential equation. $$f'(x)= \int x^{-\frac{3}{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{x^{-\frac{3}{2}+1}}{-\frac{3}{2}+1} \Rightarrow -2x^{-\frac{1}{2}} + C$$ $$f'(4)= -2(4)^{-\frac{1}{2}}+ C= 2 \Rightarrow -4+C= 2 \Rightarrow C= 6$$
Thus, the first differential equation is $f'(x)= -2x^{-\frac{1}{2}}+6$ $$f(x)= \int -2x^{-\frac{1}{2}}+6 \Rightarrow 2(\frac{x^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{-\frac{1}{2}+1}) \Rightarrow -4x^{\frac{1}{2}}+6x+C$$ Since $f(0)= 0, C=0$, so the final differential equation should be $f(x)= -4x^{\frac{1}{2}}+6x$, but the book answer has $3x$ in place of my $6x$.

33042,Stuck at the proof of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma,"I'm currently trying to prove the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma using lower Darboux-sums and an approximation of any integrable function $f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as
$$t(x) := \begin{cases} m_i & \text{for } x_i \leq x < x_{i+1},\; i < n\\ m_n & \text{for } x= 1 \end{cases},$$
where $m_i := \inf\nolimits_{\xi \in [x_i, x_{i+1}]} f(\xi)$ and $P = \{x_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ is a partition of the interval $[0,1]$. Now I want to show that
$$\int_0^1 t(x) \cos(\lambda x) \; \mathrm dx \leq \varepsilon$$
for some $\varepsilon > 0$. Our assistant professor told us that it was possible to actually integrate $t(x) \cos(\lambda x)$ but I just don't see how to. I guess I would have to make use of the product rule twice (as $\int t(x) \; \mathrm dx = s(f,P)$), but the problem is that I don't know the integral of the lower Darboux-sum (or whether it even exists) and also I don't know the derivative of $t(x)$ (or whether it exists). How am I supposed to proceed? Is there a different trick to integrate $t(x) \cos(\lambda x)$? Thanks for any answers in advance.","['integration', 'analysis']"
33050,Hausdorff distance vs. distance of the boundaries,"I'm tagging this question homework because I'm more interested in hints than in complete solutions. First let us give a definition. Definition Let $X$ be a metric space. For all $F \subset X, \rho \ge 0$, let $F_\rho$ be the union of all closed $\rho$-balls centered at some point of $F$. For all compact $C, D$, call Hausdorff distance the quantity $$d_H(C, D)=\inf(\rho \ge 0 \mid C \subset D_\rho, D \subset C_\rho).$$ (Wikipedia on Hausdorff distance) . Now take two simple smooth loops $\gamma_1, \gamma_2\colon[0, 2\pi]\to \mathbb{R}^2$ and denote with $D_1, D_2$ the compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ they encircle. The problem states that $$d_H(D_1, D_2) \le \lVert \gamma_1 - \gamma_2 \rVert_{\infty}.$$ How to prove this? I've thought about it quite a little bit. We are here asked to prove that, for every $\xi \in D_1$, there is some $\eta \in D_2$ such that $\lvert \xi - \eta \rvert \le \lVert \gamma_1-\gamma_2\rVert_{\infty}$ (the claim will follow by interchanging $D_1$ and $D_2$). In other words, it is to be shown that we can always travel from a fixed point in $D_1$ to somewhere in $D_2$ in less than $\lVert \gamma_1-\gamma_2 \rVert_{\infty}$ units of distance. But I must admit that I can't show this. Can someone lend me a hand?","['general-topology', 'analytic-geometry']"
