1820168,A very little known approximation for the lesser angle of a triangle,"In the article A note on an Approximation in Trigonometry is proved a very interesting approximattion to the lesser angle of a triangle (in degrees): $ (1)  A \approx \frac{344\Delta}{2s(s-a)+bc}$ Where $\Delta$ is the area of the triangle, $s$ is the semiperimeter, and $bc$ are the two adjacent sides of the angle $A$. For the case of a right triangle, the formula becomes simpler: $A \approx \frac{172a}{b+2c}$ where $c$ is the hypotenuse. This approximation seems to be very old, and have been appeared in a XVI century book on trigonometry. It is very little known, and have good accuracy. The proof in the article is purely analytical. So, my question is: How to prove the approximate formula $(1)$ by means of plane geometry only?","['real-analysis', 'trigonometry', 'calculus', 'analytic-geometry', 'geometry']"

1820188,How to think of 2 intersecting planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a cone?,"It is well known that any (possibly degenerated) conic section in $\mathbb{R}P^2$ is given by, up to a projective transformation, a point, a line, two lines or a circle (given by the equation $x_0^2+x_1^2=x_2^2$ ). Now, I want to look at these solutions as subsets in $\mathbb{R}^3$, under the usual identification $\mathbb{R}P^2=S^2$ (with antipodal points identified), where I draw lines through the origin and all points on a given conic of $\mathbb{R}P^2$. The result is in most cases a cone, (where I define a cone as the solid obtained by rotating a line about a line through one of its point): $\bullet$ A circle becomes a regular cone $\bullet$ A line becomes a plane (which can be seen as a 'flat' cone) $\bullet$ A point becomes a line (again, a degenerated cone) $\bullet$ Two lines become two intersecting planes. This last case doesn't really fit into the picture. My question thus is how we can interpret two intersecting planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as some kind of degenerated cone.","['conic-sections', 'projective-geometry', 'geometry']"

1820304,What is an easy example of non-Noetherian domain?,"Keep in mind, I'm strictly an amateur, though a very old one. I learned about imaginary numbers barely two years ago and ideals a year ago, and I'm still decidedly a novice in both topics. In the university library, I was looking at Modules over Non-Noetherian Domains by Fuchs and Salce and I couldn't really understand anything. I'm also looking at the ""Questions that may already have your answer,"" but if they do, it's not in a way that I can understand. Then I thought what about a finite ring, like maybe $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, but that's only created more questions, like: can a finite ring be non-Noetherian? Although $5 = 5^n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{10}$ besides $0$, we're still dealing with only the ideal $\langle 5 \rangle$, right? There's no ascending chain of ideals even though some numbers in this domain have infinitely many factorizations, right? It is a Noetherian ring after all, right? My question, it seems, has then become if it's possible for a non-Noetherian ring to be within the comprehension of a dilettante such as myself, or must it necessarily be esoteric and exotic?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'noetherian']"

1820326,When is the line integral independent of parameterization?,"Let $\alpha: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be a smooth path (i.e. $\alpha'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$), and let $f$ be a continuous vector field. The line integral of $f$ along $\alpha$ is defined as $\int_a^b f[\alpha(t)]\cdot \alpha'(t) dt$. In a typical calculus textbook, it is written as $\int_C f_1 dx + f_2 dy$, suggesting that the line integral depends only on $C$ - the image of the path, not the actual parameterization $\alpha$. In general however, this is not true. For example, $\oint_C -ydx + x dy =2\pi$ when integrated along the path $\alpha: [0,2\pi]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2, \alpha(t) = (\cos(t), \sin(t))$. The value becomes $4\pi$ when integrated along $\beta: [0,4\pi]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2, \beta(t)= (\cos(t),\sin(t))$, even though $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the same image. My question: what additional assumption is required to make the notation $\int_C f_1dx +f_2 dy$ unambiguous?","['multivariable-calculus', 'line-integrals']"

1820350,Any Nilpotent Matrix is not Diagonalizable,"I'm trying to go about the proof that any matrix that is nilpotent
(i.e. $\exists N \in\Bbb N. A^N = \mathbf{0}$ ) cannot be diagonalizable.
I believe that the best way to go about this is by showing
that a given eigenvalue's
geometric multiplicity is not the same as its algebraic multiplicity. However,
I am having some difficulty figuring out what aspect of nilpotency might
help me with this calculation. I can see that if $A^N = \mathbf{0}$ for some $N \in\Bbb N,$ I think
it may be reasonable to prove that the only eigenvectors we get from $A$ are the $\mathbf{0}$ vector, although I am not entirely sure if this is the
appropriate way to prove the above statement, given that it doesn't
necessarily pertain to multiplicity but more of the mechanics of finding
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix. Any recommendations on this problem?","['matrices', 'diagonalization', 'linear-algebra']"

1820410,Does an iterated exponential $z^{z^{z^{...}}}$ always have a finite period,"Let $z \in \mathbb{C}.$ Let $t = W(-\ln z)$ where $W$ is the Lambert W Function.  Define the sequence $a_n$ by $a_0 = z$ and $a_{n+1} = z^{a_n}$ for $n \geq 1$ , that is to say $a_n$ is the sequence $z, z^z, z^{z^z} ...$ This is sometimes called the iterated exponential with base $z$ . Here I am trying to prove (or disprove) $2$ things: For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $y^\star \in [0,\infty)$ such that for any $y \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|y| > y^\star$ the iterated exponential with base $z = x+ yi$ converges to a set of $3$ periodic accumulation points.  As $|y| \to \infty$ the $3$ points approach the orbit $\lbrace 0, 1, z \rbrace$ Let $E = (e^{1/e} , \infty) \cup \lbrace s \in \mathbb{C}:|t| = |W(-\ln s)| = 1 $ and $t^n \ne 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N} \rbrace$ If $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus E$ , the iterated exponential is bounded and there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the iterated exponential converges to a set of $k$ periodic accumulation points. I have been studying Daniel Geisler's tetration map ; my first question is essentially a formalization of some observations I have made.  My second question has proven to be more problematic.  I have been experimenting numerically for several years, and I have observed that an iterated exponential sometimes gets ""slingshot"" to a neighborhood of $\infty$ .  When this happens it can be very difficult to tell what the next terms will be. The main thing I have tried in these situations is a kind of asymptotic analysis.  The next term $a_{n+1}$ is considered as the product $z^{\Re(a_n)}(z^i)^{\Im(a_n)}$ .  There are $36$ possibilities determined by the signs of $\Re(a_n), \Im(a_n)$ and whether $|z|, |z^i|$ are greater than, less than, or equal to $1$ .  Typically, though each factor is either $0, \infty,$ or else it just keeps going around the unit circle and doesn't approach any fixed value.  So there are really only $3$ possibilities: $0, \infty, 0\cdot\infty$ . If I'm ""lucky"" enough to get $a_{n+1} \sim 0$ , I can easily see that the ""slingshot to $\infty$ "" is followed by (approximately) $\lbrace 0, 1, z, z^z, \ldots \rbrace$ Otherwise I get stuck in limbo: it may be that the entire sequence is diverging to $\infty$ . However, I have never been able to find specific examples of this, other than $(e^{1/e} , \infty)$ .  If I get $a_{n+1}\sim \infty$ this basically puts me back at square one; I can ask the same question about $a_{n+2}$ , namely, is it $0, \infty$ , or something else.  So, in most (if not all) cases, I feel I have to explicitly calculate the next terms; otherwise I have no way of knowing if the whole sequence diverges to $\infty$ , or if some subsequent term is very close to $0$ . Another major problem is that the next term often is so big that it causes an overflow error on my calculator.  I have tried calculating the natural logs of the terms, using the iteration $b_0 = \ln z, b_{n+1} = e^{b_n}\ln z$ , but sometimes it doesn't help, because I still get overflow errors.  An example of this is $z = -2.5.$ After just 6 terms $a_n$ is on the order of $10^{26649}$ and $b_n$ has an almost identical value after 7 terms. Note : all of my work so far assumes the use of the principal branches of the natural log and the Lambert W function.","['complex-numbers', 'lambert-w', 'sequences-and-series', 'chaos-theory', 'tetration']"

1820454,What are some methods to show $\log$ is not a rational function?,"It is easy to show $\log$ isn't a polynomial (no continuous extension to $\mathbb{R}$). More challenging is showing it isn't rational. Suppose it were a rational function. Then write, the fraction in lowest terms $$\log x =\frac{G(x)}{Q(x)} \Longleftrightarrow\frac{G(x)}{\log x} = Q(x)$$ Clearly, as $x \to 0$, $Q(x) \to 0$. However, $Q(x)$ then has $x$ as factor so that $$\frac{G(x)}{x\log x} = Q_2(x)$$ It is well known that $x \log x \to 0$ as $x \to 0$, so for $Q_2(x)$ to have a finite limit as $x \to 0$, which it must since it is a polynomial, $G(x) \to 0$ as $x \to 0$ so that $x$ is a factor of $G(x)$. This contradicts the assumption that $\frac{G}{Q}$ was in lowest terms.

1820457,Measuring the degree of convergence of a stochastic process,"Consider a set of random variables $(X_1,X_2,X_3,...X_k)$ that are i.i.d. $Bernoulli(p)$ While I do not know $p$, I can estimate it using

Question: How can I determine the sample size that guarantees a minimum (arbitrary) 'degree of convergence' of the estimator? In other words, what is the point after which we can be confident that increasing the sample size from $k$ to $k+1$ will only yield a small change in our estimate of $p$ (for any $p$)? One idea I had was to look at the convergence of the variance of the sequence of estimators that is obtained by increasing $k$ gradually; that is 
$$S(k)=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k (Y(i)-\bar{Y}(i))^2$$
for $\bar{Y(k)}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k Y(i)$ Numerically, I find that $S(k)$ converges to $0$ as expected; so perhaps what I need is a condition on $S(k)$?","['stochastic-processes', 'statistics', 'convergence-divergence', 'numerical-methods', 'sequences-and-series']"
1820533,Why study non-T1 topological spaces?,"I can understand (somewhat) why one would want to study non-Hausdorff topologies, since for example the Zariski topology is so important to algebraists, and the weak topology generated by lower semicontinuous functions on the real line also isn't T2. But I have never heard of any non-T1 (not Kolmogorov, points may not be closed) space which is useful. Moreover, for any non-T1 space isn't there a quotient map to a T1 space, just using the equivalence relation ""two points are equivalent if they are topologically equivalent, ie share the same neighborhood system""? (This might even be a homeomorphism?) Why isn't T1 the fourth topological axiom? In fact, I believe I saw one author use it as such. In any case I don't see any motivation to consider spaces which don't satisfy the axiom. Am I correct in this? EDIT: Uh-oh. I thought that Kolmogorov/T0 was the same thing as T1 (i.e. I forgot that there exists something in between Hausdorff and ""all points topologically indistinguishable""). Should I vote to close this question since it was based on a false premise? I am interested in the reasons for studying T0 and not T1 spaces, so on one hand I do want to leave it open. On the other hand, what I was really confused about is why we shouldn't reduce all non-T0 spaces to T0 spaces using the above mentioned equivalence relation, and thus why anyone would study non-T0 spaces? I thought that the condition that all points are topologically distinguishable was only strictly weaker than Hausdorff, but equivalent to ""all points are closed"" -- I now realize my mistake.","['general-topology', 'soft-question', 'separation-axioms']"

Attempt: Let $n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}p_3^{\alpha_3}p_4^{\alpha_4}p_5^{\alpha_5}$ where the $p_i$ are primes. The sum of the divisors is $$(1+p_1+\cdots+p_1^{\alpha_1})(1+p_2+\cdots+p_2^{\alpha_2})\cdots(1+p_5+\cdots+p_5^{\alpha_5})=\frac{(p_1^{\alpha_1+1}-1)(p_2^{\alpha_2+1}-1)\cdots(p_5^{\alpha_5+1}-1)}{(p_1-1)(p_2-1)\cdots(p_5-1)}.$$ Then we see that $\dfrac{s(n)}{n}=\prod_{i=1}^5 \dfrac{p_i^{\alpha_i+1}-1}{p_i^{\alpha_i}(p_i-1)}$. But then $$\dfrac{p_i^{\alpha_i+1}-1}{p^\alpha_i(p_i-1)} = \dfrac{p_i-\dfrac{1}{p_i^{\alpha_i}}}{p_i-1}<\dfrac{p_i}{p_i-1}=1+\dfrac{1}{p_i-1} = \dfrac{p_i}{p_i-1}.$$ Since the last expression is decreasing for all $p_i$, we have $$\prod_{i=1}^5 \frac{p_i^{\alpha_i+1}}{p_i^{\alpha_i}(p_i-1)} < \prod_{i=1}^5 \dfrac{p_i}{p_i-1} \le \dfrac{2}{1}\cdot \dfrac{3}{2}\cdot \dfrac{5}{3}\cdot \dfrac{7}{6}\cdot \dfrac{11}{10}=\dfrac{77}{16}.$$ If we have less than $5$ primes, notice that by repeating the same process we arrive at smaller bounds.

I attempted the most straightforward way - geometric series - since $e^x \geq 1$. $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(1+e^x)(a+x)}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-kx}dx}{a+x}$$ The integrals on the right can be expressed using incomplete gamma function: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-kx}dx}{a+x}=\frac{e^{ka}}{k} \Gamma(0,ka)$$ We obtain: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(1+e^x)(a+x)}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} \frac{e^{ka}}{k} \Gamma(0,ka)$$ This is correct, but not very useful, since each incomplete gamma just disguises an integral. It can be computed independently by: $$\Gamma (0,t)=\cfrac{\exp(-t)}{t+1-\cfrac{1}{t+3-\cfrac{4}{t+5-\cfrac{9}{t+7-\cdots}}}}$$ Thus I suppose we can express the integral as: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(1+e^x)(a+x)}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}  \cfrac{1}{ka+1-\cfrac{1}{ka+3-\cfrac{4}{ka+5-\cfrac{9}{ka+7-\cdots}}}}$$ Amusing, but again, not very useful.

This series converges extremely slowly (and oscillates), so it seem quite useless for computation, however gives a pretty expression for the integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(1+e^x)(a+x)}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{L_n (ka)}{n+1} $$ Note, that the continued fraction above converges much faster than the series.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'continued-fractions', 'closed-form']"

1820997,Why is the classical Secretary Problem about Ranks?,"The Secretary Problem goes like this:
To an observer there are presented objects in a row.
He may either choose the object one it is presented or move on - there is no turning back. Objective: stop at the best Item. Some were confused by the notations to come.
I would like to try to explain what this is about.
Consider the literal setting of the problem. You get candidates and know nothing about their quality in advance, yet have to stop at the best candidate with the highest probability possible.
When this problem is put into math usually the papers start with just looking at the rank. But then you get trouble (you have to model again) if you want to consider the same problem with knowing for an example the candidates are normal distributed and you just do not know the parameters. (The winning chance rises to about 0.58 asymptotically) The way I propose the problem it is consistent for these cases and I now consider the classical problem as a special case to gain information on dealing with the more abstract problem. Think of the problem like this: The items are $F^{-1}(X_1),...,F^{-1}(X_n)$ were the $X_i$are iid. uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ and $F^{-1}$ is the pseudo inverse of a cumulative distribution function $F$, thus $F^{-1}(X_i) \sim{ F}$.
$F$ may be any continuous distribution function (jumps seem to give the observer an advantage because he does not miss chances so easy, but that is another story). Let $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{1,...,n\}$ be a stopping time. The problem then would be to get $\Delta$ such that: $\max_{D}\inf_{F} P(F^{-1}(X)_{D(F^-1(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} F^{-1}(X_i)) = \max_{D}\inf_{F} P(X_{D(F^{-1}(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)=\inf_{F} P(X_{\Delta(F^-1(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)$ Most of the time in literature the problem is solved by finding $\Delta$ with: $\max_{D}P(X_{D(R(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)= P(X_{\Delta(R(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)$. Here $R(X)=R(X_1,...,X_n)=(R_1(X_1),R_2(X_1,X_2),...,R_n(X_1,...,X_n))$ and
$R_i(X_1,...,X_i) = \sum^{i}_{k=1}\mathbf{1}_{X_k \leq X_i}$, the relative rank of the observed item. My question: Why exactly are the first expressions of my terms the same? So my question is why does hold: $\max_{D}\inf_{F} P(F^{-1}(X)_{D(F^-1(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} F^{-1}(X_i))=\max_{D}P(X_{D(R(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)$ Which is solved provided someone proves: $\inf_{F} P(X_{D(F^{-1}(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i) \leq P(X_{D(R(X))}=\max_{i \leq n} X_i)$ Note that taking ranks is some sort of protection against any distribution - you do the same thing no matter the distribution.

Suppose $\mathcal{A} = \{(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})\}$ and $\mathcal{B} = \{(V_{\beta},\psi_{\beta})\}$ are smooth atlas for $M$ and $N$ respectively. Suppose that  for each $\alpha, \beta$, the map $\psi_{\beta} \circ F \circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ is smooth, then $F$ is smooth. Proof: In order to show that $F$ is smooth, we need to show that for any chart $(U,\phi)$ of $M$ and $(V,\psi)$ of $N$, the map
$$\psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(U\cap F^{-1}(V)) \to \psi(F(U)\cap V),$$
is smooth. Let $x = \phi(p) \in \phi(U\cap F^{-1}(V))$. Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas, there exist a chart $(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})$ for which $p \in U_{\alpha}$. Also, $p \in U \cap F^{-1}(V)$ which implies that $p \in U_{\alpha} \cap F^{-1}(V)$ and thus $F(p) \in F(U_{\alpha})\cap V$. Now, $\mathcal{B}$ is an atlas for $N$, so there exists a chart $(V_{\beta},\psi_{\beta})$ for which $F(p) \in V_{\beta}$, so that $p \in F^{-1}(V_{\beta})$. It follows that $p \in U_{\alpha} \cap F^{-1}(V_{\beta})$. Now, the map
$$\psi_{\beta} \circ F \circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1} \text{ is smooth.}$$
Also, the charts $(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})$ and $(U,\phi)$ are compatible, since $\mathcal{A}$ is an smooth atlas. Similarly, the charts $(V_{\beta},\psi_{\beta})$ and $(V,\psi)$ are also compatible. It follows that both maps 
$$\phi_{\alpha} \circ \phi^{-1} \text{ and } \psi \circ \psi^{-1}_{\beta} \text{ are smooth}.$$
Hence, the map
$$\psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1}=\underbrace{(\psi\circ\psi_{\beta}^{-1})}_{\text{smooth}}\circ\underbrace{(\psi_{\beta} \circ F \circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1})}_{\text{smooth}}\circ\underbrace{(\phi_{\alpha}\circ\phi^{-1})}_{\text{smooth}},$$

Especially since $x=0$ is not out of the domain of the original equation $x> -\frac 16$, which definitely includes $x=0$. Is it because my original equation has a power of $1$, which means I have one solution, however, when I square it, I'm essentially adding a new ""x"" and upping the power to $2$, giving me $2$ solutions. Thus, if I were to keep upping the power, there would be more repeated solutions at $x=0$?

So in the function/map $ f(x) = rx $ where r is some number, isn't $r$ just a scalar? This is a map and so can't this map be represented by the matrix $(r)$?

1821791,Collocation method for solving ODEs,"I am studying numerical methods for ODEs. At the moment I am trying to get the big-picture of collocation methods. As I understand it, there are two main things: Where to set the so called ""collocation points"" and how to interpolate these points (interpolation polynomials). My question: Is it correct, that ""quadrature methods (like Gauss, Radau, Lobatto)"" define where to set the collocation points and the ""Lagrange interpolation polynomial"" interpolates between these points? Given an ODE: $\dot y = f\big(y(t),t\big)$ What is the main difference between collocation methods and Runge-Kutta methods?

Does $L_1 \cong L_2$ imply $[L_1 : F ]=[L_2 : F]$ ? Obviously, if the isomorphism fixes $F$ (which isn't always necessarily true) the result holds. The result even holds if $F$ is of finite degree over its prime field. When trying the usual proof, we get that $[L_1 : F] = [L_1^{\theta} : F^{\theta} ]=[L_2 : F^{\theta}]$ when $\theta \,\colon L_1 \rightarrow L_2$ is the given isomorphism.

1821890,Herstein or Herstein?,"I read somewhere that Herstein would prepare me nicely (abstract algebra-wise) for grad studies. I don't remember where I read it and now that I was about to buy the book I found out that there two Hersteins: Topics in Algebra (Amazon Link) and Abstract Algebra (Amazon Link) I wanted to figure out whether one is more advanced than the other or whether one is sequel to the other. So I looked at both TOCs on Amazon and saw that Topics in Algebra is about 100 pages longer. Then I tried to figure out which one is more advanced by comparing. But it's kind of confusing because for example in just the group theory part, in one book there is a chapter ''Factor groups'' whereas in the other book the chapter is called ''Normal subgroups and Quotient groups''. Now I don't know much more. So my question is: Is one of the two Hersteins a sequel to the other, that is, are they
  meant to be read in a particular order? And: Is one of them more advanced than the other? And: Is it a good idea to read both? I cannot tell how much overlap there is.","['abstract-algebra', 'book-recommendation']"
1821903,Help needed understanding this explanation for the Jacobian,"In this Quora Answer , a very intuitive explanation for the Jacobian is provided, there is however a step I don't understand: He takes this square: And via a polar coordinates transformation transforms it into this parallelogram: I get the idea, what I don't get however is how the new coordinates are calculated. He says This square transforms into a parallelogram with the coordinate change. The point $(x,y)$ transforms to the point $(r,\theta)$. The point $(x + \mathrm{d}x,y)$ becomes $( r(x + \mathrm{d}x,y) , \theta(x + \mathrm{d}x,y))$. Because it's a small square, we can find these coordinates using calculus. The new point is $\left(r + \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\mathrm{d}x, \theta + \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}\mathrm{d}x\right)$ But if the polar transformation is $ x = r\cdot cos(\theta) , y = r\cdot sin(\theta) $, shouldn't $(x,y) \rightarrow ( r\cdot cos(\theta), r\cdot sin(\theta)) $ ?

1822039,"In how many ways can you select a committee of 3 persons, so that no two are from the same department?","The problem asks the following: A certain company has 4 departments, with 100, 200, 300, and 400 employees respectively. In how many ways can you select: (a) a committee of 4 persons, so that no two are from the same department? (b) a committee of 3 persons, so that no two are from the same department? I think I've solved (a). There are four positions, and for the first position you can choose from the whole pool of the four departments {100,200,300,400} which gives you a 1000 total options. For the second position, lets say someone was chosen from the biggest department. We'll exclude that from the pool, leaving us with {100,200,300} people, i.e. 600 options. For the third and fourth positions we exclude the next two largest departments, leaving us with 300 and 100 options respectively. Multiply these values and you get the total number of options for part a. Does that make sense? For the second question (b) things get more complex. I think it's safe to say that for the first position, there are still a 1000 options for committee members. But for options b and c, what options are available depend on what you've chosen for the first option. In total, there are 4 * 3 * 2 total configurations for the departments in problem (b) (i.e. 24). I have no idea how to work out this problem. Should I manually calculate all 24 configurations? I think there needs to be a more elegant solution but I can't quite think of one. EDIT: I also just realized that you technically don't have to figure out every configuration, as many would amount to the same number of options - but I'm still stuck.

All permutations= $n!$ bads: Lets define $A_i$ to be a group of all permutations containing $i,i+1$ in it.
( $1\leq i\leq n-1$ ) My problem is to count to group of : $|A_i \cap A_j|$ where $1 \leq i < j \leq n-1$ . Because there is a big difference between $A_i \cap A_{i+1}$ and $A_i \cap A_{i+5}$ (for instance),
we can't say that both are the same. 
So we need to divide $|A_i \cap A_j|$ to 2 options. when $i+1 = j$ then $|A_i \cap A_j|=(n-2)!$ when $i+1 < j$ then $|A_i \cap A_j|=(n-2)!$ So $|A_i \cap A_j|=(n-2)!+(n-2)!$ This is a big mistake but I have no clue why.

1822075,What do attendance figures tell me about regularity? What does the average tell me about individual attendance?,"Suppose I have a group of $N$ people, attending a series of $M$ events, and (for simplicity) let's assume the overall attendance happens to be the same at each event, say $A$ people (ranging between 1 and $N$), or as a fraction $a = A/N$ (ranging between 0 and 1). However, it may not be the same people attending each event. What does knowing the attendance tell me about the individual attendance behaviour? In particular, can I draw any conclusions about the regularity of event attendance (i.e. the number of events an individual has been to)? For example, with fractional attendance $a$, it may be that (1) the same $a N$ people attended every event in the series ($M$ events), and the other $(1-a) N$ people never attended, giving an average of $a$. (2) Or it may mean that all $N$ people attended $a M$ events, also giving an average of $a$. My main question: Can you show that $a N$ people attended at least $a M$ events? More generally, given the average $a$ what is the minimum number of people $X$ (out of $N$), that attended at least $Y$ events (out of $M$)? I would have thought that this is relatively straight forward, but I couldn't find or come up with an answer. Extension 1: How would this change if the attendance at each event is variable? Would does the discrete distribution of attendance values $a_i=A_i/N$ ($i=1..M$), including the average $a = \sum_{i=1}^M a_i / M$, standard deviation, etc tell me about attendance pattern? Extension 2: I would also have thought that there are some combinatorial statements like: ""If I pick $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$ out of $N$, the minimum overlap between $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$ is such-and-such"".","['combinatorics', 'statistics', 'probability', 'average']"
