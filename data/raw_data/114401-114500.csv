1670978,Intuition under Neighbourhood concept in Topological Spaces,"I sense that I didn't grasp well the concept of “Neighbourhood” in topological spaces. I did read through definitions of neighborhood, open and closed spaces. Despite that, I miss the utility of such a concept. For example, in the definition of limit of a sequence in a topological space: a point $x$ of the topological space $(X, \tau)$ is the limit of the sequence $(x_n)$ if, for every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is an $N$ such that, for every $n\geq N$, $x_n$ is in $U$. I don't see why we choose to express the limit of $(x_n)$ in terms of neighborhoods of $x$, why not an open set on $x$? I would be glad if someone clarify this for me please. Thanks!",['general-topology']
1670979,Problem in integral on the phase plane,"I have this formula to calculate the period of a motion in the phase space (plan, in this case) along a phase curve.
\begin{equation}
T(E)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2(E-U(x))}}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the total energy of the system, $U(x)$ is the potential energy and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the points of my phase curve that intercept the $x$-axis of the phase plan (points of inversion).
Now, I'm asked to calculate the period of the small oscillations in a neighborhood of the point $x_0$, which is the point of potential energy minimum. So, basically, I have to find:
\begin{equation}
T_0=\lim_{E\to E_0}{T(E)}
\end{equation}
where $E_0=U(x_0)$. My attempt:
I have used Taylor to evaluate U(x) in a neighborhood of $x_0$. So, considering that E tends to $U(x_0)$ I got:
\begin{equation}
T(E)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2(U(x_0)-U(x_0)-U'(x_0)(x-x_0)-\frac{U''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2}{2}  }}
\end{equation}
and, since $U'(x_0)=0$ (because $x_0$ is a minimum for $U(x)$)
\begin{equation}
T(E)=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{-U''(x_{0})(x-x_{0})^2}  }
\end{equation}
So at this point I'm puzzled because $U''(x_{0})$ is positive for sure, and that leaves me with a negative number under a square root. I'm sure that somewhere i have applied some theorem where I shouldn't have. So I'm asking here and not on physics stackexchange because I feel like it's a mathematical issue. My book (Arnold) says that the solution is $2\pi$/$\sqrt{U''(x_{0})}$ but I got totally stuck here.
Can you help me? Where's my mistake? P.S. Sorry for my lack in formalism, like omitting little-o notation, etc. but I think you got my point anyways :)","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1670985,Determine periodicity from transition matrix?,"I have a two part question. Let's say we have a transition matrix T: \begin{bmatrix}

Clearly this isnt isnt irreducible because there's no way for state A for example to reach state D. Now, for periodicity, I think T is aperiodic. I did this part by drawing out the state diagram and seeing if there's any way for a state to reach itself with a GCF bigger than 1. Here are my questions: 1) Was I right in thinking this is aperiodic? 2) Is there a way to determine periodicity just from the transition matrix? Without drawing the diagram I mean.

1670992,Pointwise convergence of series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}e^{-nx}$,"For my math course I have to show that the series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}e^{-nx}$$ converges pointwise on $I=(0,\infty)$ and find the limit. I think I should prove that $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence which would show that the series converges. So what I have so far is this: We want to show that $\forall \varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for $m,n\geqslant N$ we have $|{f_m-f_n}|<\varepsilon$. Also take $m>n$. 
Filling this in gives
$$|f_m-f_n|=|\frac{e^{-mx}}{m}-\frac{e^{-nx}}{n}|=\frac{e^{-nx}}{n}-\frac{e^{-mx}}{m}\leqslant\frac{e^{-nx}}{N}-\frac{e^{-mx}}{N}=\frac{e^{-nx}-e^{-mx}}{N}\leqslant\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$$
So we pick our $N$ to be $N>\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$. And then we have proven the convergence. I am however not really sure if the step where I go from $n$ and $m$ in the denominator to $N$ is actually true.
Also, I've tried writing out this sequence to see what this limit might be, but I'm getting nowhere, really. So any tips on either proving the pointwise convergence and finding the limit is very much appreciated!","['weak-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'limits']"
1670995,Flipping fair coin -,"Examining an event. Let's say we flip a fair coin many times. Let's say 1.000.000 times. We know that even though each flip is not connected, influenced by past or future flips, in the long run each side heads or tails will end up approximately around 500.000 ( 50/50 event - theory of equilibrium) My question is: What price ranges can the difference take between heads and tails throughout the 1.000.000 flips? 
For example, if we could see the results at 1892 flips we may have witnessed a "" 70 "" difference ( 981 Heads over 911 Tails). Or maybe if we could see the results at 15250 flips we may have witnessed a "" 6 "" difference ( 7622 Heads over 7628 Tails) So...

1671071,A Successor Cardinal is Regular,"Trying to show that every cardinal $k$ , $k^+$ , its successor, is regular. This is what I've come up with. Thoughts? If this does not hold, then a cofinal map $f: \lambda\rightarrow k$ where $\lambda\leq k$ would exist. This would mean $k^+$  would be a $k$ union of sets each of size $\leq k$ . This would contradict the following: Let $k \in CARD$  and let $X=\cup_{\alpha<k}X_\alpha$ where $|X_\alpha|\leq k$ for all $\alpha < k$ . Then $|X|\leq k$ [proof: Using the Axiom of Choice, let $f$ be a function with domain$k$ such that for all $\alpha<k$ ,$f(\alpha):k\rightarrow X_\alpha$ is a bijection.

1671072,Smooth functions between manifolds and subsets of manifolds,"I'll be quoting from the Wikipedia page on smoothness . Smooth function between manifolds are defined as follows: If $F$ is a map from an $m$-manifold $M$ to an $n$-manifold $N$, then $F$ is smooth if, for every $p\in M$, there is a chart $(U, \varphi)$ in $M$ containing $p$ and a chart $(V, \psi)$ in $N$ containing $F(p)$ with $F(U) \subset V$, such that $\psi\circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}$ is smooth from $\varphi(U)$ to $\psi(V)$ as a function from $\mathbb R^m$ to $\mathbb R^n$. They then define a notion of a smooth map between arbitrary subsets of manifolds: If $f\colon X \to Y$ is a function whose domain and range are subsets of manifolds $X \subset M$ and $Y \subset N$, respectively, $f$ is said to be smooth if for all $x\in X$ there is an open set $U\subset M$ with $x\in U$ and a smooth function $F\colon U\to N$ such that $F(p) = f(p)$ for all $p \in U \cap X$. The funny thing is, they never defined a smooth map on an open subset of a manifold, even though they use this notion in their definition of smooth maps between arbitrary subset of manifolds! So my question is, how are we supposed to define a smooth map on an open subset of a manifold? Are we supposed to give the open set the structure of a manifold by giving it the subspace topology and forming an atlas on it from the set of all charts in the initial atlas contained in the open subset?","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

1671090,Functions that preserve asymptotic equivalence,"Is there any notion of preserving asymptotic equivalence by a real-valued function? Any facts known about such functions? To clarify what I'm asking I'll introduce one formalization of the idea which has come to my mind. $\mathbb R_+$ denotes $[0,+\infty)$. Consider a class $\mathcal{A}$ of continuous functions $f\,\colon \mathbb R_+ \rightarrow \mathbb R_+$, satisfying following conditions: $\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow +\infty} f(x) = +\infty$, for any two positive sequences $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ and $\{b_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, such that $$a_n \rightarrow +\infty \;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\; a_n \sim b_n \quad\text{as}\;\;\; n\rightarrow \infty,$$ we have $f(a_n) \sim f(b_n)$, as $n$ goes to infinity. Some facts about $\mathcal A$: $\mathcal A$ contains such functions, as $\log(1+x)$ and $x^\alpha$ for $\alpha>0$. For continuous $f,g\,\colon \mathbb R_+ \rightarrow \mathbb R_+$, if $f \in \mathcal A$ and $f \sim g$ then we have $g \in \mathcal A$. In particular, in our class lie the functions $f$ analityc at infinity, which means $\frac{1}{f(1/x)}$ to be analytic at zero. Thanks Joel Cohen who helped me note it. One can show that $\mathcal A$ is closed under composition, multiplication and taking linear combinations with positive coefficients. Moreover, this operations are well-defined on set $A$ of $\sim$-equivalency classes of $f \in \mathcal A$. Then, we can state some problems: Is $\mathcal A$ bounded in meaning of asymptotic growth? Can we characterize $f \in \mathcal A$ in some other terms? Is $\mathcal A$ closed under taking indefinite integral? If so, is this operation well-defined on $A$? If we modify the definition by replacing equivalent sequences with such $C^k$-smooth functions on $\mathbb R_+$, would we get the same class? What if we restrict this sequences/functions to be strictly increasing?","['reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'asymptotics', 'calculus']"
1671104,"On what kind of condition of a compact set $K$ in the plane, $C(K)$ has a generator?","This problem is also being answered on Math Overflow. Let $K\subset \Bbb{C}$ be a compact subset,$\Bbb{C}$ is the complex plane. $C(K)$ is the space of all complex continuous functions on $K$. $f\in C(K)$ is a generator of $C(K)$ means that $\{p(f) \big|\text{p is a polynomial in z}\}$ is dense in $C(K)$. If $K$ is any set consisting of finite points, it is easy to check that $C(K)$ has a generator. If $K=[0,1]$, then we know that $f(x)=x$ is a generator of $C[0,1]$ by stone-weierstrass theorem. It follows that $C(\gamma)$ has a generator for $\gamma$ that is a not closed simple curve. If $K=S^1$,unit circle on the plane. It has been proved that $C(S^1)$ does NOT have a generator.

I cannot use the unit step or other similar functions since they are just one step.

Regarding smooth steps, a likely starting point I found is here but it gives a smooth function of just a single step. I have been unable to modify the equation to make it into a staircase. I would like to specify arbitrary step heights and widths and generate a smooth staircase in the range $x$ specified. Edit (Extra info):

1671408,Can a time-shifted Brownian motion be also a Brownian motion,"Let $T<\infty$, $(\Omega,\mathcal F,P)$ a probability space carrying a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion $(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and $(\mathcal F_t)_{t\geq 0}$ the natural $\sigma$-algebra filtration generated by $(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$, $\mathcal F=\mathcal F_T$. $(A_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ is an absolutely continuous $R$-valued and strictly increasing $(\mathcal F_t)$-adapted processes satisfying $A_0=0$. Note that for a fixed $t\in[0,T]$, $A_t$ is a $\mathcal F_t$-stopping time. If we define $\tilde B_t:=B_{A_t}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal F}_t:=\mathcal F_{A_t}$, then we have that $\tilde B_0=0$, $E[\tilde B_t]=0$ for each $t$, and $\tilde B_t-\tilde B_s$ is independent of $\tilde{\mathcal F}_s$, but $E[\tilde B^2_t]=E[A_t]$. So $(\tilde B_t)$ is not a Brownian motion under $P$. I am wondering that if we can find an appropriate probability measure $\tilde P$ to make $\tilde B$ a standard Brownian motion under a new probability space $(\Omega,\tilde{\mathcal F},\tilde P)$?

I reffere to Theorem 3.4.6 in pp.174 of Brownian motion and stochastic calculus authored by Ioannis Katatzas and Steven Sherve, second edition.

For instance, this is done here . The answer is simply enough to suggest a very nice combinatorial interpretation - the number of all monic polynomials is $q^n$ and the number of monic square-full polynomials is $q^{n-1}$. Is there a combinatorial way to show the second statement about the number of monic squarefull polynomials is $q^{n-1}$? This is equivalent to the statement that there are q^{n-1} solutions to the discriminant being zero but the discriminant is not linear. However, the discriminant is in general irreducible($2\not\mid q)$ and perhaps it is true that any irreducible polynomial in $n$ variables over $\Bbb F_q$ has $q^{n-1}$ solutions? Update: A little calculation seems to show that the number of monic polynomials of degree $n$ that have no $k$-powers dividing them is $q^n - q^{n-k+1}$. For example, $k=2$ corresponds to the original square-free case. One can generalize the condition that a polynomial $p(x)$ has a square factor if and only if $\gcd(p(x),p'(x)) \neq 1$ and for $k-$free, the criterion is that $\gcd(p(x),p^{(1)}(x),\dots,p^{(k-1)}(x))\neq 1$. The corresponding discriminant condition would be that $p(x),p^{(1)}(x),\dots,p^{(k-1)}(x)$ all have $0$ discriminant.

Android supplies the following data, among others: The GPS position The accuracy of the GPS position, expressed in meters, which corresponds to $\sigma$, assuming a Gaussian distribution The bearing Note that no accuracy information is supplied for the bearing. Since the only thing the GPS receiver calculates directly is the position, while bearing is inferred from two subsequent position, my approach is to take two subsequent positions and their accuracy to determine an accuracy for the bearing. Let $P_0$ and $P_1$ be two subsequent positions, $\epsilon_0$ and $\epsilon_1$ their respective accuracies in meters, $\psi_1$ the bearing reported at $P_1$, $d$ the distance between $P_0$ and $P_1$ in meters, $\psi_\epsilon$ the unknown accuracy of the bearing, expressed in the same unit as the bearing (degrees or radians at your option) We can visualize this as a line segment from $P_0$ to $P_1$ having length $d$, and circles around each point, their radii being $\epsilon_0$ and $\epsilon_1$, respectively. As long as $\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1 <= d$, $\psi_\epsilon$ reaches its maximum when the actual locations are located just on these circles, so that the line segment connecting them lies on the common tangent of the two circles which intersects $d$. Together with the two line segments connecting each measured location with the (presumed) actual location, this becomes a figure of two similar rectangular triangles. Then: $$\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1 = d * \sin (\psi_\epsilon)$$ and thus: $$\psi_\epsilon = \arcsin (\frac{\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1}{d})$$ The limit is reached when $\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1 = d$, in which case $\psi_\epsilon$ is 90°. As soon as $\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_1 > d$, the above formula is no longer defined. Visualizing the situation, the accuracy circles overlap, which means that the actual locations can be any pair of points that is entirely within both circles and thus any bearing is possible, hence $\psi_\epsilon = 180°$. The issues here is the sudden ""jump"" from 90° to 180°; also I probably haven't paid proper attention to probability here. Is there a better formula for calculating bearing accuracy, given two positions and their accuracy? EDIT: It's been pointed out that bearing accuracy is influenced by several factors. The one that springs to my mind is that the GPS assumes the receiver has travelled along a straight line from $P_0$ and $P_1$, which will result in errors while turning. Those need to be considered separately – for now, I just need to know how the accuracy of the bearing depends on positional accuracy, without challenging any of the assumptions made by the GPS.","['statistics', 'trigonometry', 'error-propagation']"

Indeed if $\alpha = x+iy\in \mathbb{Z}[i]$, $\alpha$ is a root of the monic polynomial

1672117,Conormal bundle of Cartier divisors,"Given any closed immersion of schemes $i:Z\to X$ defined by a sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}$ on $X$, apparently the conormal bundle is $\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}:= {\mathcal{I}}/{\mathcal{I}^2}$ ""seen as a sheaf on $Z$"". My guess is that it means that in fact $\mathcal{C}_{X/Y}=i^*({\mathcal{I}}/{\mathcal{I}^2})$, but I am not entirely sure (so that's my first question). Also, an effective Cartier divisor on a scheme $X$ is a closed subscheme given by a sheaf of ideals $\mathcal{I}$ such that on an affine cover the ideal corresponding to $\mathcal{I}$ are all principal and generated by a non-zero-divisor. With this definition the sheaf $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ is nothing but $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{O}(D)$ is its ""dual"" sheaf $\mathcal{Hom}_X(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{O}_X)$ (notice that this way the bidual is not necessarily isomorphic to $\mathcal{I}$). Now I would like to know why $\mathcal{O}(-D)|_D=\mathcal{C}_{Z/X}$ (which most likely means that there exists a canonical isomorphism). I tried the obvious thing but I am very confused: locally (say in $\text{Spec}A$) $\mathcal{I}$ comes from an ideal $I=(f)$ with $f$ a non-zero-divisor. Then $\mathcal{O}(-D)|_D$ becomes $I\otimes_A A/I\cong I/I^2$. On the other hand, $\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2$ is locally $I/I^2$ and the pullback is then $I/I^2\otimes_A A/I\cong I\otimes_A A/I\otimes_A A/I\cong I\otimes A/I\cong I/I^2$. This just can't be right because then it would be true for any closed subscheme, and there are surely many errors in definitions/tensor product.

1672134,"Uniform continuity, uniform convergence, and translation","Let $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a continuous function. Define $f_n:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ by
$$ f_n(x) := f(x+1/n). $$
Suppose that $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ converges uniformly to $f$. Does it follow that $f$ is uniformly continuous? Note: the answer is clearly no if we don't assume that $f$ is continuous. I suspect there is a counterexample, showing that the answer is no even if $f$ is continuous. Edit :
The following observation might help. There exists a continuous, non-uniformly continuous function $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ such that $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ converges uniformly to $f$, if and only if there exists a continuous, non-uniformly continuous function $g:\mathbb N \times \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$, such that $(g_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ converges uniformly to $g$, where $g_n(k,x) = g(k,x+1/n)$ and the metric on $\mathbb N \times \mathbb R$ comes from viewing it as a subspace of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R$ (with the Euclidean metric, say). Proof :
Given the function $g$, there is some $\epsilon>0$ which witnesses non-uniform continuity.
That is, for each $n$, there exists $m \in \mathbb N$ and $x,y \in \mathbb R$ such that $|x-y|<1/n$ and $$|g(m,x)-g(m,y)|\geq\epsilon.$$
By moving things around, we can assume that for each $k$, there exists $y \in (0,1/k)$ such that $$ |g(k,0)-g(k,y)| \geq \epsilon. $$ Next, we can also assume that $g(k,x)=0$ for all $|x|>2$.
This is achieved by multiplying $g$ by the function $h$ which is $1$ on $\mathbb N \times [-1,1]$, $0$ on $\mathbb N \times (\mathbb R \setminus (-2,2)$, and linear elsewhere.
That $(gh)_n \to gh$ uniformly can be proven by the same argument that the product of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous. Now, we just define $f$ piecewise, by
[ f(6k+x)=g(k,x) ]
for $k \in \mathbb N$ and $x \in [-3,3]$, and
[ f(x) = 0 ]

I'm proposing to modify the measurement update process so it would be of this form: $\hat{X}_k = \hat{X}_k^- + L_k(G_kz_k - \hat{X}_k^-)$. I feel this would be less computationally taxing.

My question is if this matrix is positive semidefinite. I've ran numerical tests and the matrix always appears PSD, but I haven't been able to prove it formally. Things I've tried: Try to prove it using minors and so: no luck, sinc's are difficult to work with in order to simplify the form of the determinants. Try proving that $\forall y$ , $y^TSy\geq 0$ , that ends up being $\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N y_i y_j \sin(|x_i-x_j|)/(|x_i-x_j|) \geq 0$ . No luck either. My intuition is that the triangle inequality for distances has to play a role somewhere in it, but can't find it. Try a constructive approach. We know that for the $N=2$ case, the matrix is PD, as the diagonal elements are 1 (sinc of 0) and the non-diagonal are $<1$ , so the matrix is strictly diagonally dominant (also the determinant and trace are both positive, so $S \succ 0$ . Then prove that adding an element to the set doesn't make the resulting matrix indefinite. I've tried using Schur complements for this task but no luck yet. Also for any set $X$ , we can multiply all elements by a scalar $\alpha$ . As $\alpha$ goes to 0, all the elements in the set also go to 0 and $S \to \vec{1} \vec{1}^T$ , which is PSD rank 1. As $\alpha$ goes to infinity, so do the points and so do the distances, so $S \to I$ . So changing $\alpha$ , the matrix moves in a 1D curve in the group $\mathcal{S}$ of symmetric matrices and the curve starts in the boundary of the cone of PSD matrices and ends in the middle of the cone, so it seems natural that it doesn't leave the cone, but I can't prove it.

Suppose we have an equation like $yu_x(x,y)+xu_y=0$ subject to some appropriate condition (e.g. $u(0,x)=h(x)$ for some function $h$). As this is a quasilinear first-order PDE, we can try and solve it using the method of characteristics. So, we set $x=x(s,t)$, $y=y(s,t)$, and $z(s,t)=u(x(s,t),y(s,t))$. We have to solve $$\frac{dx}{dt}=y,\quad \frac{dy}{dt}=x,\quad \frac{dz}{dt}=0$$ subject to some conditions. The third equation gives $z(s,t)=A(s)$ for some function $A(s)$ to be found using the conditions. However, the first two equations lead nowhere because to solve, say, the first one, you have to have an expression for $y$ in terms of $s$ and $t$. But you don't have this because in order to solve the second equation you have to have an expression for $x$ in terms of $s$ and $t$.

1672694,What is known about the asymptotics of Riccati's equation?,"I'm interested in examining the asymptotic behavior of Riccati equations of the form $$
y'(x) = f(x) + g(x) y^2(x)
$$ for $x \to \infty$. I've done some digging but I can't seem to find a simple explanation of how to go about computing something like this. If that's too general, then take this example $$
y'(x) = 10x e^{-2x}  - \frac{10}{x^2} y^2
$$
It seems ""obvious"" just by looking at this that as $x \to \infty$ we have $y'(x) \to 0$ so $y \to \text{constant}$. Some numerical simulations have shown that $y \sim 0.17$ for large $x$ but is it possible to show this (most importantly, the actual value of the constant) directly from the equation?","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1672714,Proof for the calculation of mean in negative binomial distribution,"I am trying to figure out the mean for negative binomial distribution but have run into mistakes. I know there are other posts on deriving the mean bu I am attempting to derive it in my own way. I wonder if any of you can point out where my mistake is: In negative binomial distribution, the probability is:
$$
p(X=x) = \frac{(x-1)!}{(r-1)!(x-r)!}p^r(1-p)^{x-r},
$$
where $X$ is a random variable for the number of trials required, $x$ is the number of trials, p is the probability of success, and r is the number of success until $x$th trial. Therefore, to calculate expectation: $$
E(x) = \sum_{x=r}^{\infty}xp(x)=x\sum_{x=r}^{\infty}\frac{(x-1)!}{(r-1)!(x-r)!}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}=\sum_{x=r}^{\infty}\frac{x!}{(r-1)!(x-r)!}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}
$$ Let $k=x-r$, then the formula becomes:
$$
E(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(k+r)!}{(r-1)!k!}p^r(1-p)^k=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(k+r)!}{(r-1)!k!}p^r(1-p)^k=
r\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(k+r)!}{r!k!}p^r(1-p)^k
$$ By binomial theorem, $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(k+r)!}{r!k!}p^r(1-p)^k$ becomes $[p+(1-p)]^{k+r} = 1$, and thus $E(x) = r$, which is obviously wrong. I cannot figure out what is wrong with my proof, and thus any help will be appreciated. For reference, someone else has done a similar proof here, but I still have trouble understanding the mistake(s) in my proof: Deriving Mean for Negative Binomial Distribution.","['statistics', 'probability']"
1672717,Interior of a Totally Disconnected Set,"Let $(\mathbb{R},T)$ be the reals with the standard topology. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then, If $A$ is totally disconnected, then $\operatorname{Int}(A) = \emptyset$ where $\operatorname{Int}(A)$ refers to the interior of $A$. This can be proven by considering the contrapositive. If $\operatorname{Int}(A)$ is not empty then there is a point $x \in A$ that has an open neighborhood, $V$, such that $V \subset A$. As all open sets in $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology consist of intervals, that means $A$ contains an interval. As intervals are connected and are not singletons, this means $A$ can not be totally disconnected which completes the proof for the contrapositive. The issue I'm having is that I don't want to work only with $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology. The property that, If $A$ is totally disconnected, then $\operatorname{Int}(A) = \emptyset$ is not true for general topological spaces. The discrete topological space on $R$ is a counterexample (which also means not all metric spaces satisfy the property). An example of a topological space that isn't discrete, but this property still fails is a finite topological space with 3 elements. Specifically, let $X = \{a,b,c\}$ and $T_X = \{\emptyset,\{a\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\}\}$.Then, $A = \{a,b\}$ is totally disconnected, but has an interior of $\{a\}$. Currently, my intuition is that the property fails only when your topological space has connected components that are singletons from the rest of the space. I'm not sure how to prove that, nor am I entirely confident that's the only way it can fail. So, the question is how can I characterize the topological spaces where my desired property (totally disconnected implies empty interior) holds? Side note: The origin of this question comes from me trying to characterize what the pre-image of an interval can look like. Initially, I was trying to do the problem just with the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but after I got partial success when I tried to generalize my argument, I ran into a problem with this property not being true in general. My own relevant math background is the first few chapters of munkres and the first 7 chapters of baby rudin. Edit: Based on the comments with Matt, the question could also be stated as how can I characterize the topological spaces where an open, totally disconnected set exist? Is it possible for a connected space $(X,T_X)$ to have this property (assuming X has more than one element)?","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
1672749,Assume $f$ is a continuous one-to-one function over an interval. Prove that $f$ is strictly monotone,"Assume $f$ is a continuous one-to-one function over an interval. Prove that $f$ is strictly monotone. Attempt Since we know that $f$ is one-to-one, for every $f(x)$ there is exactly one element $x_0$ that maps to it. Thus, if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x=y$. Now let's suppose that $f$ isn't monotone. That is, it goes from nonincreasing to nondecreasing. Thus, on some interval $[a,b]$ we must have  $f'(x) < 0$ and on some other interval $[c,d]$ we must have $f'(x) > 0$. As a result we must have that $f'(x) = 0$ at some point.

An algebraic fibre space is a surjective projective morphism $f:X\to Y$ of reduced and irreducible varieties such that $f_*\mathcal O_X=\mathcal O_Y$. To prove the claim in the example, first take the normalization $\nu:Y'\to Y$.
Then the normality of $X$ implies that $X\to Y$ factors through $\nu$ so that we have $X\to Y'\to Y$, where $\nu$ is a finite morphism.
