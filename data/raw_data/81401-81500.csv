1058658,Describe the Riemann surface for $w=z^2-1$.,"Question: Describe the Riemann surface for $w=z^2-1$. My thoughts so far: the Riemann surface needs two cuts emanating from the origin across the real line since it maps every input to one point above the real line and one point below.

1058661,Symmetric matrices and commutativity,"Q: Let $m, n$ be positive intergers. Let $A$ and $B$ real $n\times n$ matrices. Assume that $B$ is symmetric and positive definite. If $A$ commutes with $B^{m}$, prove that $A$ commutes with $B$. So I don't really know where to start with this other than the decomposition theorem for symmetric positive operators, so that I can write $B$ as diagonal with positive real entries. Perhaps taking the $m^{th}$ root could be useful which we can do since $B$ has positive entries, but I'm not sure. Many thanks!","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

It turned out to be true, so I know this proves that the circle $x^2+y^2-1=0$ is actually a rational variety in $\mathbb{A}^2$. Does this hold for all $n\geq 2$ also? I mean, is the $n$-spher given by $x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2-1=0$ a rational variety in $\mathbb{A}^n$? I had a hard time generalizing the argument there to higher dimensions. I googled around, but no results turned up, but I suspect this is a standard question which is well known. I tried: Let $S=V(x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2-1)$.

1058972,Double Factorial: Number of possibilities to partition a set of $2n$ items into $n$ pairs,"I know that the partition of $2n$ items into $n$ pairs has something to do with double factorial, but I am not sure how many possibilities we exactly have. We can choose such a partition into pairs by first choosing $n$ elements to be in one half and the remaining $n$ in the other half, which gives ${{2n} \choose n}$ possibilities. Then we can take a permutation of both sets and match them accordingly. This gives $${{2n} \choose n} n! n!=\frac{(2n)! n! n!}{n! n!}=(2n)!$$ possibilities. But with this we overcount, since we do not want the pairs to be ordered. Each of the $n$ pairs is counted twice, wherefore we have to divide by 2 for every pair, hence $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n}$? Well, another possiblity to do that is just to iteratively pick $2$ elements among the remaining ones, which gives ${{2n} \choose 2} {{2n-2} \choose 2} \dotsb {4 \choose 2}$ I am not sure, but I do not think that this is the same and also, I do not see the connection to double factorial.

1059274,"Show that the variance, $\mathbb E((x-\mathbb E(x))^2)$, can be written as $\mathbb E(x^2)-(\mathbb E(x))^2$","This question has been set in the Christmas work for the chemists at oxford uni and the hint that was given in the problem sheet was ""does $\mathbb E(x)$ depend on $x$?"". There is a derivation on Wikipedia:
$$\mathbb E((x-\mathbb E(x))^2)$$
Expand the brackets (I get this bit)
$$\mathbb E(x^2-2x\mathbb E(x)+\mathbb E(x)^2)$$
Use the fact the expectation value of the sum of the terms is the same as the sum of the expectation values of the terms:
$$\mathbb E(x^2)-2\mathbb E(x\mathbb E(x))+\mathbb E(\mathbb E(x)^2)$$
This step isn't written explicitly in the derivation on Wikipedia but it must be the case. Now the step that I don't understand: $$\mathbb E(x^2)-2\mathbb E(x)\mathbb E(x)+\mathbb E(\mathbb E(x)^2)$$ Why does the term in the middle not change to $2\mathbb E(x)\mathbb E(\mathbb E(x))$?

(And suppose $E(X)$ exists.) An exercise in our course notes asks to prove that the central sample moments $m_k'=\frac 1n((X_1-\bar X_n)^k+\cdots+(X_n-\bar X_n)^k)$ are consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimators for the $\mu_k'$. ($\bar X_n$ denotes the sample mean $\frac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n)$.) Recall ""$T_n$ is asymptotically unbiased for $t$"" means $E(T_n)\to t$, and ""$T_n$ is consistent for $t$"" means $\P(|T_n-t|>\varepsilon)\to0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$ (that is, $T_n$ converges in probability to $t$, denoted $T_n\top t$). I was able to do the consistency part, based on the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) which says $\bar X_n\top E(X)$ for i.i.d. $X_l$'s: $$\frac1n((X_1-\bar X_n)^k+\cdots+(X_n-\bar X_n)^k)=\sum_{j=1}^k\binom kj(-\bar X_n)^{k-j}\frac1n\sum_{l=1}^nX_l^j.$$
By WLLN, each $\frac1n\sum_{l=1}^nX_l^j\top E(X^j)$ and $\bar X_n\top E(X)$ and hence the whole thing $$\top\sum_{j=1}^k\binom kj (-E(X))^{k-j}E(X^j)=E((X-E(X))^k).$$ (Recall $A_n\top A$ and $B_n\top B$ implies $A_n+B_n\top A+B$ and $A_nB_n\top AB$.) Proving the asymptotic unbiasedness seems much harder:
$$E\left(\frac {(X_1-\bar X_n)^k+\cdots+(X_n-\bar X_n)^k}n\right)\overset?\to E((X-E(X))^k).$$ I have some ideas but can't make a proof from it: I know that $E(T_n)\to t$ implies $T_n\top t$ (provided $\var(T_n)\to0$). I don't know if the reverse is true, at least I can't invert the proof of that implication. We have $E(\frac1n(X_1^k+\cdots+X_n^k))=\frac1n\cdot n\cdot E(X^k)=E(X^k)$. We can't however do the same because each $k$th power $(X_l-\bar X_n)^k$ involves every other $X_l$ too. Perhaps we can use the same strategy with Newton's binomial expansion as above, but I don't think there's a general rule which says that $E(A_n)\to a$ and $E(B_n)\to b$ implies $E(A_nB_n)\to ab$. Since at this point in the notes the concept of convergence in distribution isn't introduced yet, I don't expect to need it. The Strong Law of Large Numbers (for i.i.d. $X_l$: $\bar X_n\to E(X)$ almost everywhere provided $E(X)$ exists) has been mentioned without proof but can be used, I suppose.

This is an appealing reason, but I am wondering if there are other useful perspectives with which to think about this theorem. I have worked through some counterexamples but still am not really able to put my finger on exactly why it openness may fail for surjective bounded linear maps between spaces which are not necessarily Banach. It is obviously true in the finite case, one circuitious argument being that the exact sequence $0 \to R^k \to R^n \to R^{n-k} \to 0$ splits, and projection maps are open. Can the open mapping theorem be thought of as saying that surjections in the (""isomorphic"") category of Banach spaces are like projections, even thought not all exact sequences split (because not all closed subspaces are complemented)?","['functional-analysis', 'soft-question', 'banach-spaces']"

I have gone as far as proving the following: Suppose $S_\cdot$ is generated by $x_i$'s for $i=0,...,n$. Then by definition of closed subscheme, on $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Proj}\ S_{\cdot}}(D(x_i ))$ we have an ideal $I_i$ of $((S_{\cdot})_{x_{i}})_{0}$. Then I let $J_i$ to be the homogeneous ideal in $S_{\cdot}$ such that $$ J_{i}=\bigoplus_{d}\{a\in S_d: a/x_{i}^{d}\in I_{i}\}.$$ Then I let $I=\cap J_{i}$. The reason why I arrive at this is as follows and in fact I am not even sure it is correct: that each of the $I_i$ in $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Proj}\ S_{\cdot}}(D(x_i ))$ corresponds to a closed subscheme of $D(x_i )$. Then $X$ is supposed to be the union of these closed subschemes which translates to the intersection of ideals, and hence the result. Surprisingly, I got the correct homogeneous ideal by checking the sources, but I have a problem of proving that this corresponds to the desired $X$. I have searched several sources but it requires using coherent modules and some other techniques which are only proven in the later chapters. Is there a way to prove this using elementary way?

Exercise 20 begins with this definition: Definition: Given a (commutative, unital) ring $A$ and an $A$ -module $M$ , and a submodule $N\subset M$ , the radical of $N$ in $M$ is $$r_M(N) = \sqrt{\operatorname{Ann} M/N}$$ It then asks us to prove analogues to the formulas in exercise 1.13 for the radical of an ideal. Formula 1.13(v) is $$\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}} = \sqrt{\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}+\sqrt{\mathfrak{b}}}$$ This is true by taking radicals in the pair of inclusions $\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}\subset \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}+\sqrt{\mathfrak{b}}$ and $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}} \supset \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}+\sqrt{\mathfrak{b}}$ , the first of which is totally obvious and the second of which is because if $x^k\in\mathfrak{a}$ and $y^\ell\in\mathfrak{b}$ then $(x+y)^{k+\ell}\in\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}$ . It seems to me that the analogous formula in the module setting is $$
\label{eq}\tag{1}
r_M(N+N') = \sqrt{r_M(N)+r_M(N')}
$$ While the inclusion $r_M(N+N') \supset r_M(N)+r_M(N')$ is true here for more or less the same reason as $\sqrt{\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}} \supset \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}+\sqrt{\mathfrak{b}}$ , and taking radicals gives $r_M(N+N')\supset \sqrt{r_M(N)+r_M(N')}$ , the other inclusion has been confounding me and leading me to wonder if this is not the right generalization of formula 1.13(v). So, question: Is this the right analogue of 1.13(v)? If so what's the proof of the inclusion $r_M(N+N') \subset \sqrt{r_M(N)+r_M(N')}$ ? If not, what's the right analogue? Thoughts: if this is the right analogue, and the proof is also analogous, the desired inclusion should follow by taking radicals in the inclusion $$\operatorname{Ann}\frac{M}{N+N'} \subset r_M(N)+r_M(N')$$ But I can't think of a reason for this. If $x\in A$ puts $M$ inside $N+N'$ , to prove this statement I'd need to decompose it as something $y+y'$ where a power of $y$ puts $M$ inside $N$ and a power of $y'$ puts $M$ inside $N'$ .

1059945,Two Projective closures of $\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$ which are not isomorphic as varieties.,"I am doing some sample problems for my upcoming Algebraic Geometry exam, and one of the questions is: Is it true that all projective closures of an affine variety $X$ are
  isomorphic as varieties? The problem gives the hint to consider various projective closures of $X=\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$. Here a projective closure of an affine variety $X$ is a closed subvariety $Y\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ for some $n$, together with an isomorphism $X\to U$ where $U\subset Y$ is open and dense. Discussion I started by considering the natural projective closure of $X=\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$: We consider the identification of $\mathbb{A}^1$ with $D(x_0)\subset \mathbb{P}^1$, i.e. the map 
$$\phi:\mathbb{A}^1\to D(x_0), \enspace p\mapsto [1:p]\in \mathbb{P}^1$$ Since $X$ is an open dense subset of $\mathbb{A}^1$, $\phi(X)$ is open and dense in $\mathbb{P}^1.$ Therefore $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a projective closure of $X$. The aim now is to find another projective closure of $X$ which is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a variety. For this I decided to view $X$ as $Y:=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{A}^2:xy=1\}=Z(xy-1)$. We get a projective closure for $Y$ by considering the image of $Y$ under the image of the $n=2$ analog of $\phi$: $$\varphi:\mathbb{A}^2\to D(z)\subset \mathbb{P}^2=\{[z:x:y]\}, \enspace (x,y)\mapsto [1:x:y]. $$ 
The image of $Y$ is $\{[1:y:x]:yx=1\}$. For example then 
$$\varphi(Y)=D(z)\cap V(xy-z^2)$$ 
and so $V(xy-z^2)$ is a projective closure for of $Y$ and thus $X$- here I have used $V(f)$ to denote the zero set of a homogeneous poly $f$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$. I can't see why this variety would not be isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$- it looks like it might be.However, we also have 
$$\varphi(Y)=D(z)\cap V(zxy-z^3)$$ and $V(xy-z^2)\subsetneq V(zxy-z^3)$ since $xy=z^2\implies z^3=zxy$ however $[0:1:1]\in V(zxy-z^3)\setminus V(xy-z^2)$. It then should follow that $V(xy-z^2)$ and $V(zxy-z^3)$ are non-isomorphic projective closures of $X$. Is this correct?

$$
g(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0,&\mbox{if $x\leq 0$},\\
\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{1-x}}},&\mbox{if $0<x<1$},\\
1,&\mbox{if $x\geq 1$},
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Then
$$
G(x)=g\left(\frac{x-a}{b-a}\right)g\left(\frac{d-x}{d-c}\right)
$$
is a smooth function which equals 1 on [b,c] and vanishes outside (a,d).
However, I don't know how to modify it to satisfy $$
G(x)+G(x^{-1})=1

1060139,Prove that $F(b)-F(a)\geq \int_a^b F'(t)dt$ if $F$ is increasing,"If $F$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ then show that $F(b)-F(a)\geq \int_a^b F'(t)dt$. My work: Since $F$ is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$, $F'$ exists a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$. So $F'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. Now by $L-R-N$ theorem there exists a complex measure $\lambda \bot m $ ($m$ is the lebesgue measure) such that, $F(b)-F(a)=\mu_F([a,b])=\lambda ([a,b])+\int_a^b F'(t)dt$. Then there is a decomposition of $[a,b]=A\cup B, $ where $A\cap B = \phi$ such that $m(A)=0$ and $\lambda (B)=0$. Now I must prove that $\lambda ([a,b])\geq 0$. I am stuck now. How do I prove it? can anyone please help?","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis']"
1060150,Factoring quadratics - how to?,"It has been some time since I have studied math (and even then it was base-level math), and I know this will probably be easy for most, but I need help with Simplifying Algebra equations. Simple equations like so I can do: 3x + 7 + 9x -4 would (I really hope) equal 12x + 3 , right? I now have an equation I wish to get my head around, and it is: Now I have done some searching for the guides on how to perform the above and have either ended up with base level answers which did not help the above, or more difficult examples I could not quite get my head around. I have attempted to get the answer then ""work backwards"" at it, but I cannot wrap my head around the following (Wolfram Alpha): I would ask you, the wonderful users of this forum, to either help explain the above question, or provide me the ability to learn this independently. Update After looking into the FOIL method, I referred to my genius co-worker for assistance- I think he is able to explain things to an idiot (me) and it works. Basically we went through the quadratic formula method (which I understand!) and my workout was as follows: This is how I have processed this equation (with great skill!): I then apply the same method to the bottom and get the following: With the top line, I understand we perform both 3+7 and 3-7 (which results in 5 and -2), however in the second option I assume (and this is merit to my lack of math knowledge), we performed the opposite function of minus due to the original sum being plus 5. Is this correct?
Following on, performing both the addition and subtraction we get 6+4 which results in 10 and six minus 4 which results in two, which then when divided is 1. I am just attempting to understand why the 1 in this function is negative. Can you please either highlight anything I am doing incorrectly, advise if there is a incorrect step or let me know if all is okay? Much appreciated!",['algebra-precalculus']
1060154,Help with a recurrence with even and odd terms [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : convoluted recurrence: $f(2n)=f(n)+f(n+1)+n, f(2n+1)=f(n)+f(n-1)+1$ (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . I have the following recurrence that I've been pounding on: $$
a(0)=1\\
a(1)=1\\
a(2)=2\\
a(2n)=a(n)+a(n+1)+n\ \ \ (\forall n>1)\\
a(2n+1)=a(n)+a(n-1)+1\ \ \ (\forall n\ge 1)
$$ I don't have much background in solving these things, so I've been googling around looking for different techniques. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to correctly apply them yet. So far I've tried: Characteristic equations Generating functions Plugging it into Wolfram Alpha Telescoping Observation I'm sure that one or more of these is the way to go, but my biggest problem right now is figuring out how to deal with the idea that there are different equations for odd and even values of $n$. I'm not necessarily looking for a solution (though it would be gratefully accepted), but any nudges in the right direction would be much appreciated. To follow up, it turned out that the speed problem described in my comment, below was related to the Decimal implementation in Python 2.7. Switching to Python 3.3 (and Java) made everything many orders of magnitude better.","['recurrence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
