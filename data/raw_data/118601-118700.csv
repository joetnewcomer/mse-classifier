1763268,"Determine whether $w$ is in the $Span\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$","my question is how to determine whether a vector $w$ is in the $span\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$. In this case: $w = \begin{bmatrix}

$v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\-1\\1 \end{bmatrix}$ , 
$v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\-1\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix}$ , 
$v_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\0\\3 \end{bmatrix}$ My understanding so far is that I must see if $w$ can be written as a linear combination of $v_1, v_2,$ and $v_3$. To do this, I row reduced the augmented matrix of the 4 vectors to the identity matrix $I_4$ $$I_4 = \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right]$$ but from here I am confused.

1763283,Integer Triangle Radicals conjecture,"An integer sided triangle has an area $A$. Heronian triangle areas have no radical, or radical 1. Otherwise, $4 A$ will always be of the form $a\sqrt{r}$, where $r$ is the squarefree radical of the triangle. For the first 24 squarefree numbers, here are the smallest triangles with a given radical. Now consider sequence $G$. $$G = (24,8,1,0,8,8,3,0,8,24,1,0)$$ Integer Triangle Radicals conjecture: For a triangle with radical $r$, let $j = r \mod{12}$. Then value $4 A/\sqrt{r}$ is divisible by $G_j$ (with $j \in \{1,...,12\})$. Stated another way, $G_j$ is the GCD of all $4 A/\sqrt{r}$ values corresponding to a particular radical $r$. Another picture: I've got data from a few million integer triangles suggesting this conjecture is true (supporting code at Triangle Radicals ). All Heronian triangles have area divisible by 6, based on the Brahmagupta parametric form . If this conjecture is true, that hints there might be a more powerful parametric form that classifies all integer triangles. Does a proof exist? Mini-challenge: For radical 953, my scalenes are {{528, 681, 697}, {533, 680, 693}, {561, 656, 689}}. For radical 977, my scalenes are {{567, 690, 697}, {612, 657, 685}}. Can someone find triangles with radicals 953 or 977 where $4A$ is divisible by 8, but not 16? This came out of studying Wheel Graphs with Integer Edges .  I noticed all integer-edged wheel graphs with largest edge $<10$ were composed of triangles with exactly 1 or 2 types of radical.

Show that there is a sequence of sets $A_n \downarrow \emptyset$ with $\lim_{n\to \infty} \mu(A_n) \neq 0$. Where $A_n \downarrow \emptyset$ means that the sequence $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is such that $A_k \supset A_{k+1}$ and $\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty A_k = \emptyset$.

Now, my intuition tells me that each element of the sequence has an infinite number of elements, thus $\lim_{n\to \infty} \mu(A_n) \neq 0$, and the infinite intersection satisfies $\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty A_k = \emptyset$, because the set only has a countably infinite number of elements.

I tried to search online by I can't get a complete proof. Take $M$ to be maximal and $Z$ to be central subgroup of order $p$. Case 1: $Z\subset M$ We prove by induction on $|P|$. For the base case, $|P|=p$. There is no maximal subgroup in $P$, hence the result holds Assume that the result holds for all $p$-group $Q$ with $|Q|<|P|$ Note that $|Z|>1$. Hence $|P/Z|<|P|$. Suppose that $M/Z$ is not a maximal subgroup of $P/Z$. Then there exists a subgroup $H$ such that $M/Z\subset H/Z \subset P/Z$. But this also implies that $M\subset H \subset P$. This means that $M$ is not maximal, a contradiction. Hence $M/Z$ is a maximal subgroup of $P/Z$. By induction hypothesis, $M/Z$ has index $p$ and $M/Z\trianglelefteq P/Z$. First, we can conclude that $M \trianglelefteq P$. Second, note that $[P/Z:M/Z]=p$. Hence $[P:M]=p$. Case 2: $Z\not\subset M$ This implies that $P=ZM$. Let $p=zm\in P$ where $z\in Z$ and $m\in M$.

1764012,Can we detect smoothness of a norm by its behavior along paths?,"We say a norm $\| \cdot \|$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is smooth if it is smooth as a function $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$. (i.e, after restricting the domain). We say a norm is smooth along paths , if for any smooth path $\alpha:I \to \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}$, the composition$\|\cdot\| \circ \alpha$ is smooth. Does smoothness along paths of a norm implies that it's smooth? (Note that in general differentiability along paths is not enough to detect smoothness , but in this case we are talking about a norm, not a general function). Remarks: 1) Since any norm is Lipschitz (w.r.t the metric induced by it), it follows that the value of the derivative $\frac{d}{dt}\big|_{t=0} \|\alpha(t)\| $ depends only on $\dot \alpha(0),\alpha(0)$ and not on other properties of the specific path chosen. (See a proof at the end). Thus, for each $a \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, there is a function:
$T_a:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by: $T_a(v)=\frac{d}{dt}\big|_{t=0} \|\alpha(t)\|$ where $\alpha(t)$ is any path satisfying $\alpha(0)=a,\dot\alpha(0)=v$. It is proved here that if $T_a$ is linear, then $\|\cdot  \|$ is differentiable at the point $a$. So, proving linearity of $T_a$ (for every $a$) will show at least that $\|\cdot\|$ is one-time differentiable. (Showing harder degrees of regularity, i.e twice differentiability etc sounds more challenging, but let's start with that). So far, using homogeneity and triangle inequality, I managed to prove:
$$T_a(\lambda v)=|\lambda|T_{\frac{a}{\lambda}}(v) \, \, \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R},$$ $$T_a(v+w)\le T_a(v)+\|w\|\, \, , \, \,T_a(v+w) \le T_{\frac{a}{2}}(v)+T_{\frac{a}{2}}(w)$$ Proof of claim (1): (The derivative depends only on the velocity of the path) $$\big| \|\alpha(t)\|-\|\tilde \alpha(t)\| \big| \le \|\alpha(t)-\tilde \alpha(t) \|,$$ so assuming $\tilde \alpha(0)=\alpha(0),\dot{\tilde \alpha}(0)=\dot \alpha(0)=v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we get: $$(*)\, \, \bigg| \frac{\|\alpha(t)\| - \|\alpha(0)\|}{t}-\frac{\|\tilde \alpha(t)\| - \|\tilde \alpha(0)\|}{t}\bigg| \le \|\frac{\alpha(t)-\tilde \alpha(t)}{t} \| $$ Now since $\lim_{t \to 0}\frac{\alpha(t)-\tilde \alpha(t)}{t} =\lim_{t \to 0}\big( \frac{\alpha(t)- \alpha(0)}{t}-\frac{\tilde \alpha(t)-\tilde \alpha(0)}{t}\big)=v-v=0$ we get by the continuity of the norm, together with $(*)$ we obtain the required equality $$ \frac{d}{dt}\big|_{t=0} \|\alpha(t)\|  = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\|\alpha(t)\| - \|\alpha(0)\|}{t}=\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\|\tilde \alpha(t)\| - \|\tilde \alpha(0)\|}{t}=\frac{d}{dt}\big|_{t=0} \|\tilde \alpha(t)\|$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'normed-spaces', 'smooth-manifolds']"

Here's my proof of the first. Let $$\alpha = \lim_{n\to\infty} \inf \frac{c_{n+1}}{c_n}.$$ Then $\alpha \geq 0$. If $\alpha = 0$, then we're done since $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{c_n} \geq 0.$$ So we suppose that $\alpha > 0$ and choose a real number $\beta$ such that $0 < \beta < \alpha$. Then by the result analogous to Theorem 3.17 (b), there is an integer $N$ such that $n \geq N$ implies $$ \frac{c_{n+1}}{c_n} > \beta,$$ which in turn implies $$c_{n+1} > \beta c_n.$$
  So for each $n \geq N$, we have 
  $$c_n \geq  \left( c_N \cdot \beta^{-N} \right) \cdot \beta^n. $$
  Thus, for $n \geq N$, we have $$\sqrt[n]{c_n} \geq \beta \sqrt[n]{  c_N \cdot \beta^{-N}  }.$$ Then taking the limit inferior of both sides, we get 
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\inf \sqrt[n]{c_n} \geq \lim_{n\to\infty} \inf \left( \beta \sqrt[n]{ c_N \beta^N} \right) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( \beta \sqrt[n]{ c_N \beta^N} \right) = \beta \cdot 1 = \beta$$
  by Theorem 3.20 (b). Thus we have shown that for any (positive) real number $\beta$ such that $\beta < \alpha$, we have $$\beta \leq \lim_{n\to\infty} \inf \sqrt[n]{c_n},$$ 
  which implies that $$\alpha \leq \lim_{n\to\infty} \inf \sqrt[n]{c_n},$$ as required. Is the above proof correct? If so, then is my presentation good enough?

Then $\sum c_n z^n$ converges if $\vert z \vert < R$, and diverges if $\vert z \vert > 1$. The proof makes use of the root test, which is Theorem 3.33.

However, we quickly run into problems; to understand what the problem might entail I picked $f = \exp(-x^2)$ and  $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ as friendly looking example and found to my dismay that the general solution takes the form
\begin{equation}
u(x) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}x\mbox{erf}(x)+\frac{1}{2}\exp(-x^2)+Ax+B
\end{equation}
where erf$(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_0^x\exp(-t^2)\mathrm{d}t$ is the error function and $A,B$ are constants. The $x$erf$(x)$ term assures that for any choice of $A,B$ that $u\to\infty$ as $|x| \to \infty$, at least in one of the directions: if we pick $A=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ the forward direction decays appropriately but not so in the backward direction, and vice versa. Of course, on a bounded domain we can always make a choice of constants such that the Dirichlet boundary condition is fulfilled, in particular on $[-L,L]$ the choice $A=0$, $B=-\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}L\mbox{erf}(L)-\frac{1}{2}\exp(-L^2)$, but clearly as $L\to\infty$, $B$ also grows without bound. My question then, is how bad is the situation? Do things improve for $N\geq 2$? The greater variety of harmonic functions might mean we can find one such that summing it with the solution derived via convolution with the Newton Kernel will allow us to satisfy the decay conditions but then again, maybe not. How can we understand this? Can we find success by restricting the class of functions? In 1D we can guarantee that the integral of a function decays iff the mass of the function is zero; is there an analogy for integrating twice? Assuming the answer to either of these is positive, can we then say anything about the integrability of the resulting $u$ over $\mathbb{R}^N$? In particular, I'd like to be able to talk about quantities such as $||\Delta^{-1/2} f||_{L^2 (\mathbb{R}^N)}$, but I'm not sure this will be possible without moving into some kind of weighted spaces if at all.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'elliptic-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

1764477,Problem about a compact operator $T:l^p\rightarrow l^p$,"I have to solve this problem. Let $\{\lambda_n\}$ be a sequence of real number such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\lambda_n=0$ and consider the operator $T:l^p\rightarrow l^p$, $1\leq p\leq \infty$, defined by $$T(\{x_1,\ldots x_n,\ldots\})=\{\lambda_1 x_1,\ldots,\lambda_n x_n,\ldots\}
$$
  Prove that $T$ is compact. My attempt is the following. I have considered the operator $$
T_N:l^p\rightarrow l^p,\quad T_N(\{x_1,\ldots x_n,\ldots\})=\{\lambda_1 x_1,\ldots,\lambda_N x_N,0,0,\ldots\}.
$$
$T_N$ is clearly linear and it is also compact. In fact given any bounded sequence $\{x^{(n)}\}_{n\geq 1}$ in $l^p$, the sequence $\{T_Nx^{(n)}\}_{n\geq 1}$ is bounded in $\mathbb{R}^N\subset l^p$. Then, since every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^N$ has a convergent subsequence, it follows that $T_N$ is compact. Now, I have to prove that $T$ is compact. For this I proved that $||T_N-T||\rightarrow 0$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$. In fact we have:
$$
||T_N-T||=\sup_{||x||=1}||(T_N-T)x||=\sup_{||x||=1}||T_Nx-Tx||=\sup_{||x||=1}\left(\sum_{i=N+1}^{\infty}|\lambda_i x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$
and, given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\bar n$ such that $|\lambda_n|<\epsilon$, for every $n>\bar n$. So if we take $N>\bar n$, we get
$$
\sup_{||x||=1}\left(\sum_{i=N+1}^{\infty}|\lambda_i x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\leq\epsilon\sup_{||x||=1}\left(\sum_{i=N+1}^{\infty}|x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\leq\epsilon
$$
Therefore $||T_N-T||\rightarrow 0$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$ implies that $T$ is compact. My questions are: (1) is the proof of the compactness of the operator $T_N$ correct? (2) is the conclusion correct? Thanks","['functional-analysis', 'compact-operators', 'lp-spaces']"

Let $\{T_n\} \to T$ in $L(X,Y)$ and $\{u_n\} \to u$ in $X$, then $\{T_n(u_n)\} \to T(u)$ in $Y$. Proof: Let $T_n, T \in L(X,Y)$ such that $\{T_n\} \to T$ in $L(X,Y)$. Since $T$ and $T_n$ are bounded for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists constant $M_0$ and $M_n$ respectively for which $n \in \mathbb{N}$
$$||T(u)|| \leq M_0 ||u|| \quad\forall u \in X,$$
$$||T_n(u)|| \leq M_n ||u|| \quad \forall u \in X.$$
Define $M = \sup_n \{M_n\}$. We claim that $M$ is finite because each linear operator $T_n$ is bounded. Otherwise, $M = \infty$ and thus for some $n$, we have that $M_n = \infty$, so that $T_n$ is unbounded and therefore we obtain a contradiction. Now,
$$||T(u) - T_n(u_n)||= ||T(u) -T_n(u)+T_n(u)- T_n(u_n)||\leqslant \cdots\\ \cdots \leqslant ||T(u) -T_n(u)||+||T_n(u)- T_n(u_n)||\leqslant \cdots \\ \cdots \leqslant  ||T-T_n||.||u|| + M .||u-u_n||.$$
Using taking the limit as $n$ approach infinity and using the fact that $\{T_n\} \to T$ in $L(X,Y)$ and $\{u_n\} \to u$ in $X$, we have
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} ||T(u) - T_n(u_n)|| \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( ||T-T_n||.||u|| + M .||u-u_n||\right) = 0$$

This is the space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions, i.e. $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n) =\{f\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) | \forall_{\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N}_0^n} \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}|x^\alpha \partial^\beta u(x)| < \infty \}$ which is equipped the metric $$\rho(u,v)= \sum _{\alpha, \beta \in\mathbb{N}_0^n} 2^{-|\alpha|-|\beta|} \frac{\|u-v\|_{\alpha, \beta}}{1+\|u-v\|_{\alpha, \beta}},$$ 
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiindices and $\|u\|_{\alpha,\beta}= \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}|x^\alpha \partial^\beta u(x)|$ Thus I need to show that for every $\varphi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ there is a sequence $(u_k)_{k\geq 1}$ such that for all multiindices $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as above $\|\varphi-u_k\|_{\alpha, \beta}$ converges to $0$ as  $k\rightarrow \infty$. 
Does anyone have a hint/source on how to construct such a sequence? I'd really like to figure this out but as it stands I'm stuck at the beginning. My first guess was to use that $C_0^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is dense in $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, then show that the linear span of the Gaussians is dense in $C_0^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with respect to $\rho$ and afterwards apply some diagonal sequence argument. But so far I haven't succeeded in finding such an approximation. EDIT: So I have thought about the suggestion and this is what I understand so far: 
I know that the convolution for $\varphi \in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $T \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is defined for all  distributions $\psi$ via 
$$< \varphi *T,\psi> := <T, \mathcal{R}(\varphi) * \psi> $$
where $\mathcal{R}f(x) = f(-x)$ is the reflexion operator. But this definition should also translate to a tempered distribution $\phi$ convoluted with a gaussian of the type $G=ae^{\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{2b}}$ for $a\in \mathbb{R}$,$b>0$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$. 
Therefore if I choose $\phi$ in $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$such that $<\phi, G> =0 $ for all G and define $g_\epsilon = e^{\frac{-|x|^2}{2\epsilon^2}}$ as below the convolution $g_\epsilon*\phi$ is well-defined. Furthermore by the choice of $\phi$ I know 
$$ <g_\epsilon * \phi, G> = <\phi, \mathcal{R}(g_\epsilon)*G> = 0$$
as $\mathcal{R}(g_\epsilon)*G $ is again of type G. 
On the other hand $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \mathcal{R}(g_\epsilon)*G = G$ so also $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} <g_\epsilon * \phi, G> = <\phi,\mathcal{R}(g_\epsilon)*G>  =<\phi, g_\epsilon *G> =  <\phi, G> = 0$$ by the symmetry of $g_\epsilon$ and the definition of $\phi$. 
Maybe my thoughts are flawed but so far I don't know how to conclude that $\phi =0$. (This should be equivalent to the support of $\phi$ being the empty set, but I only see that $<\phi, \psi>$ vanishes for $\psi \in G$ and not for all $\psi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n))$","['functional-analysis', 'approximation-theory', 'schwartz-space', 'fourier-analysis']"

I am trying to find the total displacement and the total distance that my drone flew. So I know that a velocity-v-time graph provides several important things about the drone. The area underneath the curve is the total displacement of the drone; the slope of the graph is the drone's acceleration. In order to find the total displacement of the graph I have to use a definite integral. After getting my trend line equation, I tried to use a definite integral, but received a displacement way to high to be correct. I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what I am doing wrong. Some things to note: I have the actual displacement which was measured with measuring tape. The actual/theoretical displacement of my drone is $58\, cm$. When I graphed the trend line, my minimum $x$-point was $9.8$ because the drone started recording data even when it hovered and our professor said it was fine if we do not include that data. My maximum $x$-point is $18.7$ because this is when the drone completed its flight path and landed. Velocity was negative at some points during this flight.

isolated singularities in the negative integer arguments. Finally, since
the Bernoulli polynomial $B_{2m}\{x-1\}$ is bounded the residual is a convergent integral for $s + 2m >1$, so we can extend the 
convergence as far as $s > 1-2m$, for any positive number $m$. The question here is what ""$m$"" to choose. If I choose $m=1$, I did the computations and found something which made no sense.","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-number-theory', 'calculus']"

L = y_i  \log  {{1}\over{1+e^{-\hat{y}_i}}}+(1-y_i)\log {{e^{-\hat{y}_i}}\over{1+e^{-\hat{y}_i}}}
$$ On page 75 it reports that $$
\textrm{grad} = {{1}\over{1+e^{-\hat{y}_i}}}-y_i
$$ But I have not been ale to reproduce the passages to get to that result. Please note that on page 73 is specified that the gradient is intended with respect to $ y_i $ , but I suspect that it should be calculated with respect to $ \hat{y}_i $ , because first it makes sense in the context, second in the whole presentation and in the paper that presents this method, gradients are always calculated with respect to $ \hat{y}_i $ . Either way I cannot understand how he obtain that result. Long version of the question: I am trying to use the xgboost R package for a little side project. One of the reasons that have lead me to try it out is the fact that it lets you define your own  customized objective function. Problem is that the example I reported above is pretty much the most detailed documentation that I were able to find. In the official documentation ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf , page 9)uses the same example and explains that you should define a function that returns gradient and second order gradient and just input it as a parameter of the training method. Making such a function wouldn't be a problem if only I were sure about what ""gradient and second order gradient"" means, and I am not sure since I cannot understand the only example I have, which is supposed to be quite simple, so if somone can explain me what calculations he permorms that would be much appreciated.","['derivatives', 'calculus']"
