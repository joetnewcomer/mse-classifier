712734,Domain of a random variable - sample space or probability space?,"In most probability theory texts you'll see a random variable definition that goes something like this: A probability space is a triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, a real valued random variable is a function $X:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ The computer scientist in my head can't get around what seems to be a type-error.  Is a random variable dependent on $P$ or not.  My intuition says it is, which is why we say things like 'uniformly distributed random variable', but in this case shouldn't a random variable be a function from the probability space, i.e. $X:(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.  In fact this is how it is defined in Wolframs mathworld. Alternatively, one could imagine in a functional programming language a function which counts the number of heads from a set of coin tosses.  This function could be independent of whether or not the coin is fair or biased, etc, and hence in some way independent of $P$. I understand some of this may be just for convenience when speaking, but this is how a random variable is rigorously defined, so I believe I must be missing something.  In other words, my question is, is a random variable associated with probabilities or independent of it.",['probability-theory']

712791,Application of Lefschetz duality to prove Lefschetz hyperplane theorem,"I'm trying to understand the proof of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem in Milnor's book ""Morse Theory"", page 41 but I can't understand his use of Lefschetz duality. At this point it has been proven that a non singular affine algebraic variety of complex dimension $k$ has the homotopy type of a CW-complex of dimension less than or equal to $k$.  We wish to prove the following: Let $V$ be an algebraic variety of complex dimension $k$ lying in complex projective space $\mathbb{C} P^n$.  Let $P$ be a hyperplane of $\mathbb{C} P^n$ containing all singularities of of $V$.  Then the inclusion map $V\cap P \to V$ induces isomorphisms in singular homology in dimensions strictly less than $k-1$.  In dimension $k-1$ the induced homomorphism is onto. The proof goes like this: Consider the long exact sequence of the pair $(V, V\cap P)$:
$$\dots \to H_i (V\cap P) \to H_i (V) \to H_i (V, V \cap P) \to H_{i-1} (V) \to \dots$$
It is sufficient to show that $H_i (V, V \cap P) = 0$ for $i \leq k-1$.  By Lefschetz Duality $$H_i(V, V\cap P; \mathbb{Z}) \cong H^{2k-i}(V - (V\cap P);\mathbb{Z})$$
But $V - (V\cap P)$ is a Zariski closed set in the affine space $\mathbb{C} P ^n - P$ and is nonsingular since $P$ contains the singularities of $V$.  Hence $V - (V\cap P)$ is a nonsingular affine algebraic variety and so applying our theorem we find $H^{2k-i}(V - (V\cap P);\mathbb{Z})=0$ for $i \leq k-1$. My confusion is over the application of Lefschetz duality.  I was familiar with Poincare duality but not Lefschetz duality so I had to look it up .  The statement seems simple enough but I don't understand how what Milnor is saying follows from Lefschetz duality.","['algebraic-geometry', 'morse-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"

Say $S_n$ acts on $\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n\}$ and $A_{n+2}$ acts on $\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n,\alpha_{n+1},\alpha_{n+2}\}$.  Let $\sigma \in S_n$ and let $\phi: S_n \to A_{n+2}$ be given by $\phi(\sigma)=\sigma$ if $\sigma$ is an even permutation, and $\phi(\sigma)=\sigma(\alpha_{n+1}\alpha_{n+2})$ if $\sigma$ is an odd permutation.  This way $\phi(\sigma) \in A_{n+2}$. Now, let $\sigma, \rho \in S_n$.  Then $\phi(\sigma \rho)=\sigma \rho (\alpha_{n+1}\alpha_{n+2})$.  Also, $\phi(\sigma)\phi(\rho)=\sigma(\alpha_{n+1}\alpha_{n+2})\rho(\alpha_{n+1}\alpha_{n+2})=\sigma\rho$. So, $\phi(\sigma \rho)$ does not seem to equal $\phi(\sigma)\phi(\rho)$.  But the idea is that we want $\phi(S_n) \cong S_n$, and $(\alpha_{n+1}\alpha_{n+2})$ does not permute any members of $\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n\}$, so $\phi(\sigma \rho)$ and $\phi(\sigma)\phi(\rho)$ are equal as permutations on this (sub)set. This feels a little subtle to me and I'm not sure if my idea is valid or not.  If it is not, can this proof still be saved?  I appreciate any thoughts on this.

712918,"Using a compass and straightedge, what is the shortest way to divide a line segment into $n$ equal parts?","Sometimes I help my next door neighbor's daughter with her homework.  Today she had to trisect a line segment using a compass and straightedge.  Admittedly, I had to look this up on the internet, and I found this helpful site .  There they claim that the fewest number of ""steps"" necessary to trisect the segment is $4$, where by one ""step"" we mean any stroke of the pencil, either with the compass or straightedge. Immediately, this got me thinking about the length of other optimal constructions, which has led to the question of this post: What is a the minimum number of steps necessary to construct a segment of length $\frac{1}{n}$ given a segment of length $1$? If $s(n)$ is the quantity in question, then this other helpful site shows that $s(n)\le n+6$.  However, $s(2)=3$ and $s(3)=4$, so the bound is not sharp.  Also, we can see that $s(mn)\le s(m)+s(n)$ by creating a segment of length $\frac{1}{mn}$ from one of length $\frac{1}{n}$. Finally, at the bottom of the first site, they hint at one method of construction, which involves drawing larger and larger circles.  Assuming their hint leads to an optimal construction (which would need to be proved), I believe that the first eight values of $s(n)$ starting with $n=1$ are: $$0,3,4,5,5,5,5,6$$ This returns nothing on OEIS.  (The above numbers assume that the initial segment of length $1$ is marked off on a very long ray, else we'd have to add one for $n\ge3$ to lengthen the segment appropriately).

It could oscillate wildly, like $x\sin \dfrac{1}{x}$ at $x=0$. I'm not really sure if there are other options.

713061,"On the use of ""generic"" and ""general"" in algebraic geometry","I have learned that in algebraic geometry, when an 'object' can be put in a family which is in a bijective correspondence with some projective variety, the generic object in this family is one which lies in a (Zariski) open dense subset of the variety. So, for example we can talk of the generic divisor in a linear system, e.g. the generic curve on a surface etc. However, for curves I have seen the word general being used as well, sometimes. I initially thought that this were synonyms, but then started wondering if this is really so. I am a bit confused. I did not find an answer by looking at the index in Hartshorne's book.

713084,Completion of a measure space,"Studying Measure Theory in University, I came across the following definition for the completion of a measure space: let $(X,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ be a measure space; then the set

So far, I've proved $\varnothing,X\in\overline{\mathcal{E}}$, or in fact that $\mathcal{E}\subseteq\overline{\mathcal{E}}$, since for any $A\in\mathcal{E}$ we have $A\triangle A=\varnothing$ and obviously $\mu(\varnothing)=0$, and that, supposing $\overline{\mu}$ is well-defined, it extends $\mu$, as one possible $B$ set for which $\overline{\mu}(A)=\mu(B)$ is $A$ itself, as used in the short proof above. My doubts are: 1) Give $A,B\in\overline{\mathcal{E}}$, are $A\cup B$ and $A\smallsetminus B$ elements of $\overline{\mathcal{E}}$? In other words, is $\overline{\mathcal{E}}$ a $\sigma$-algebra? 2) Is it true that for any two such sets $B,B'$ as enter the definition of $\overline{\mu}$, we have that $\mu(B)=\mu(B')$?

N & (\text{situations with }k\text{ pairs}) = \\
 & = N(\text{pairs of functions }(f \colon A \rightarrow B, g \colon B \rightarrow A) \\
 & \quad \text{ whose composition has exactly }k\text{ fixed points}) = \\
 & = \sum [\text{over selections of }k\text{ elements from both }A\text{ and }B] \\
 & \quad N(\text{pairs of functions whose composition is identity only on the selection}) = \\
 & = {\binom {n} {k}}^2 \cdot k! \cdot N(\text{pairs of functions on two sets containing } \\
 & \quad s = n - k\text{ elements whose composition has no fixed points})
\end{aligned} $$ This is how I reduced the original problem to the problem in question. If the solution to that problem was $N(s)$, the answer to the original problem would be $$E(\text{number of pairs}) = \frac {1} {(n^n)^2} \sum\limits_{k=0}^n k \cdot {\binom {n} {k}}^2 \cdot k! \cdot N(n - k)$$ WHAT I TRIED TO DO Approach: fix $g$, count $f$s. $$ \begin{multline}
N(s) = \sum [\text{over all functions }g \colon B \rightarrow A] \\
N(\text{functions }f \colon A \rightarrow B\text{ such that the composition }h = g \circ f \\
\text{ has no fixed points})
\end{multline} $$ Problem: all such $f$s have to send every $a$ to anywhere but $g^{-1}(a)$. Therefore, there are $\prod\limits_{a \in A} (n - \left|g^{-1}(a)\right|)$ such functions. The sets $\left\{g^{-1}(a)\right\}_{a \in A}$ form a partition of $B$. The obvious next idea is to classify all $g$s based on that partition, but the formulas start to get really scary. UPD: I wrote a simulation that actually counted directly the expectation for $n=1..5$ (the $O(n\cdot(n^n)^2)$ approach). The expected value is always exactly 1. I have no idea how to interpret that, given the crazy formula for expectation. I would mostly appreciate an idea for an approach, not a complete solution.","['applications', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

This is the definition of a 2-form (and it's similar for a p-form, just extended) but I don't understand what this definition means by $Y$ ? Just any old vector field that we can choose? Surely $Y$ has to be subject to certain constraints and are these just assumed implicitly? e.g $Y$ has to the same dimension of $X$ ? Or is it slightly more subtle than this? My confusion gets even worse With a p-form, as then we have $p-1$ of these new vector fields! I'll show you an example I was trying to understand before reverting back to this ambiguous (hopefully not for long) definition for clarity, and failing: $\textit{Compute the interior product of X and} \space d\omega \space \textit{where}$ $X=y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+2z\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+3xy\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ , $\omega=2zdx+3xdy-7zx^2dz$ .

713439,Proof of equivalence of Sobolev Space and Lipschitz functions,"The attachment is a proof from Evans book ""Measure Theory and Fine Properties of Functions"" pg 132 Theorem 5. The statement of the theorem is: Let $f:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is locally Lipschitz in $U$ if and only if $f \in W^{1,\infty}_{loc}(U)$. My two questions are only regarding the first direction($\Rightarrow$) of the theorem. Can we get the sequence $g_{i}^{h_{j}} \rightharpoonup g_{i}$ weakly in $L^{p}_{loc}(U)$, where $g_{i} \in L_{loc}^{\infty}(U)$ by noting: Since $(g_{i}^{h_{j}})_{j}$ is bounded in $L^{\infty}_{loc}(U)$ we can find a weak* convergent subsequence such that $g_{i}^{h_{j}} \rightharpoonup g_{i}$ in $L^{\infty}_{loc}(U)$ and then use Theroem 3 in section 1.9 (which states: since $g_{i}^{h_{j}}$ is bounded in $L^{\infty}_{loc}(U)$ there exists a subsequence which converges weakly in $L^{p}_{loc}(U)$) to get a further subsequence (which I will again call $g_{i}^{h_{j}}$) such that $g_{i}^{h_{j}} \rightharpoonup v$ weakly in $L^{p}_{loc}(U)$, by uniqueness of limits we get $v = g_{i}$.
Does this reasoning work? Is there a simpler way to show this? To get the result that $\lim\limits_{j \rightarrow \infty}\int_{U}f(x)\frac{\varphi(x+h_{j}e_{i})-\varphi(x)}{h_{j}}dx = \int_{U}f(x)\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_{i}}dx$ at the end, can I use the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem where I would dominate $f(x)\frac{\varphi(x+h_{j}e_{i})-\varphi(x)}{h_{j}}$. Since $\varphi \in C_{c}^{1}(V)$ is continuous on a compact  set it is bounded, so $\frac{\varphi(x+h_{j}e_{i})-\varphi(x)}{h_{j}} \leq C $ for some constant $C > 0$. But since $V$ is bounded we get $\int_{V}Cdx \leq C\int_{V}dx = C|V| < +\infty$. Then $g := MC$ becomes the summable function which dominates  , where $M := \Vert f \Vert_{L^{\infty}_{loc}(U)}$.

This can be done directly, but it may be time consuming, depending on the number of $\delta$'s and the size of $A$ and $B$.

But, alas, that is not the case. My intuition is that no such matrix algebra shortcut can exist in the scenario under consideration, but I am hopeful that someone can prove me wrong. edit: I should have provided more information about that.  What I really want is a matrix, $M$, such that $MM^{T} = (A + \delta B)^{-1}$.

713565,Are these two binomial sums known? Proven generalization to the Hockey Stick patterns in Pascal's Triangle,"English translation. You can see the original - deprecated - in Portuguese here Hi, I arrived at a generalization for the Hockey Stick Patterns, from our beloved Pascal's Triangle. This generalization involves the product of pairs of binomial numbers, and therefore reassembles Vandermonde's Identity 
$$\sum \limits_{j=0}^{r}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q\choose r}\tag a$$ According to identity $(8)$ on the wikipedia page Binomial Coefficient we have the following looking similar formula
$$\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q+1\choose r+1}\tag b$$ Let's get to the point! As we know, the RHS Pattern (Right Hockey Stick) is related to columns and tells us that $${n+1\choose p+1}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{n-k\choose p}\tag 1$$ Letting $d$ be the displacement - referring to columns - between $\displaystyle {n+1\choose p+1}$ and the stick/column itself - what we have today is a particular case when $d=0$ - we'll have the following for $0 \le d \le p-1$: $${n+1\choose p+1}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}\tag 2$$ In this case, we see a generalization is possible by introducting another column, the column $d$. 
And both columns are aligned to each other. Proof From $(2)$ we have $k\gt n-p$ $\longrightarrow$ $n-d-k\lt p-d$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-p}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}$$ Letting $m = d + k; j = d; q = n; r = p$; And $0\leq k\leq n$ $\longrightarrow$ $d\leq d+k\leq n+d$ $\longrightarrow$ $j\leq m\leq q+j$ So, we have $$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose p-d}=\sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ $m<j$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{m\choose j}=0$ $m>q$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{q-m\choose r-j}=0$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}=\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ According to $(b)$, $$\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q+1\choose r+1}={n+1\choose p+1}$$ As expected. Now let's get to the LHS pattern (Left Hockey Stick) - which is related to diagonals - that says $${n+1\choose p}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^p{n-k\choose p-k}\tag 3$$ Calling $d$ the displacement - referring to diagonals - between $\displaystyle {n+1\choose p}$ and the stick/diagonal - what we have today is a particular case when $d=0$. For $0 \le d \le n-p-1$, we have $${n+1\choose p}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^p {d+k\choose k}{n-d-k\choose p-k}\tag 4$$ Now, we see a generalization is possible by introducting another diagonal, the diagonal $d$. 
And both diagonals are aligned to each other. Proof From $(4)$ we have
$$\sum \limits_{k=0}^p {d+k\choose k}{n-d-k\choose p-k}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^p {d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose n-p-d}$$ $k\gt p$ $\longrightarrow$ $n-d-k\lt n-p-d$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{k=0}^{p}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose n-p-d}=\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose n-p-d}$$ Letting $m = d + k; j = d; q = n; r = n-p$; And $0\leq k\leq n$ $\longrightarrow$ $d\leq d+k\leq n+d$ $\longrightarrow$ $j\leq m\leq q+j$ So, we have $$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{n}{d+k\choose d}{n-d-k\choose n-p-d}=\sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ $m<j$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{m\choose j}=0$ $m>q$ $\longrightarrow$ $\displaystyle{q-m\choose r-j}=0$ $$ \longrightarrow \sum \limits_{m=j}^{q+j}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}=\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}$$ According to $(b)$, $$\sum \limits_{m=0}^{q}{m\choose j}{q-m\choose r-j}={q+1\choose r+1}={n+1\choose n-p+1}={n+1\choose p}$$ As expected.

Valid moves are: subtract $1$ divide by $2$ , applicable if $n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ divide by $3$ , applicable if $n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ For example, you can reduce 10 in 3 steps: $10 \rightarrow^{-1} 9 \rightarrow^{/3} 3 \rightarrow^{/3} 1$ . Let's define $f(n)$ as the answer for number $n$ . Then we have $f(1) = 0$ and for $n > 1$ : $f(n) = 1 + \min \{ f(n-1), (n \mod 2) + f(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor), (n\mod 3) + f(\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor) \}$ $n$ is restricted to $10^9$ in the original source, which makes it easy to solve in $O(n)$ using dynamic programming or a breadth-first search, but that isn't really interesting. Initially I thought that the tricky range for $n$ would only be small (below $10^6$ or so) and for larger $n$ we could apply some simple greedy algorithm that prefers division by 3 or 4, even if we need to subtract 1 first. I tried to test some identities that could lead to such a heuristic: $f(n) = 1 + f(n - 1)  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 1,5 \pmod{6}$ (that's easy to prove, because there's only one valid move) $f(n) = \min \{ f(\frac{n}{2}), f(\frac{n}{3}) \} \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ $f(3n) \geq f(n)$ $f(n) = f(\frac{n}{3})  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{3^3}$ $f(n) = f(\frac{n}{3})  \ \ \forall n: n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \textbf{ and } n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ ... But all but the first three have turned out not to be correct, and those are not very helpful because you still have a branching factor of 2. You can use the third inequality to prune during a depth- or breadth-first search, but I also can't prove that this yields a ""good"" algorithm, $O(\log^c n)$ or something. I understand that it might have something to do with the exponents of 2 and 3 in the prime factorization of $n$ , but I can't put my finger on it, since you always have the possibility to get to any equivalency class modulo 2 or 3 within at most 2 steps and change up everything. Do you have any ideas on how to formalize this or prove useful properties of the $f$ function?

However, with my current knowledge of set theory and statistics, I cannot think of a way to measure this probability, given a set size and number of contained values.

Just like there is very compact equation for say, the KL-divergence $D(p_X||q_X) = \sum_{x \in X}p_X(x) log\frac{p_X(x)}{q_X(x)}$ Is there one such equation for EMD or an algorithm for EMD such that it can be easily numerically computed? What I have found so far is the following, that $EMD(p_X,q_X)$ between distributions $p_X$ and $q_X$ is: $$EMD(P,Q) = \frac{\sum^m_{i=1}\sum^n_{j=1} f_{ij}d_{ij}}{\sum^m_{i=1}\sum^b_{j=1} f_{ij}}$$ However, to find $d_{ij}$ one needs to define some distance measure I guess and to find $f_{ij}$ one needs to solve the transportation linear programming defined in: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/RUBNER/emd.htm#RUBNER98A Isn't there a solution to the transportation problem such that there is an easy way of evaluating EMD? Also, I found a wikipedia section to compute it but, the pseudo-code was to ambiguous for me to understand how to actually compute the EMD. If someone understands that section better and can explain it, it would awesome! Here is the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover's_distance or you can just see the pseudo-code right here: The Pseudo-code/wikipedia section: If the domain D is discrete, the EMD can be computed by solving an instance transportation problem, which can be solved by the so-called Hungarian algorithm. In particular, if D is a one-dimensional array of ""bins"" the EMD can be efficiently computed by scanning the array and keeping track of how much dirt needs to be transported between consecutive bins. For example: $EMD_0 = 0 \\$ $EMD_{i+1} = ( A_i + EMD_i ) - B_i \\$ $TotalDistance = \sum | EMD_i | \\$ I guess what I don't understand is what $A_i$ and $B_i$ are and when the algorithm even stops running. Its just to unclear to me what its doing and I guess I don't understand EMD well enough to derive it myself (If I could I would!) As an extension to my question, is it a problem if the sample space for the probability distributions is infinite? I probably won't accept answer that are not as general as possible, but an answer clarifying what wikipedia article is trying to say, would definitively get an up vote.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

714504,Equivalence of Baire Space definitions,"I am hoping someone could help me show that the following statements, which define a Baire Space, are equivalent. Defn1 : Any topological space X such that the intersection of any countable collection of open dense sets is dense is called a Baire space. I know that this statement is equivalent to the following: 1)$(A_i)$ countable collection of closed nowhere dense sets $\rightarrow \operatorname{int}(\cup_i A_i) = \emptyset$. 2)Union of countable collection of closed sets has an interior point $\rightarrow$ one of the closed sets has an interior point. 3)Union of any countable collection of closed sets with empty interior has empty interior. Now the issue is that I came across another definition of a Baire Space. It is as follows: Defn2 : $X$ is Baire iff every nonempty open set is nonmeager. Are definitions 1 and 2 equivalent? If so, why?","['general-topology', 'baire-category']"
714507,Definition of convolution?,"Why do we use $x - y$ rather than $x + y$ in the definition of the convolution? Is it just convention? (If we are thinking of convolutions as weighted averages, for instance against ""good kernels,"" it should make no difference.) Why $(f * g) (x) = \int f(y) g(x - y) dy$ rather than $(f * g) (x) = \int f(y) g(x + y) dy$? Edit: I'm finding it really hard to choose a best answer. There are at least three very good ones here.","['convolution', 'fourier-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
