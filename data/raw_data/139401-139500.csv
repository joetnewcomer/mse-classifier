2240366,Most efficient algorithm to neutralize all positive and negative,"So I've been lately working on an app which requires me to code this algorithm. But I'm unsure what I've come up with is the most efficient algorithm. Say I have 2 sets (or rather arrays, as there can be duplicates) A and B with all positive values in A and all negative values in B. Ex - A = {1, 3, 1} (sum = 5) B = {-2, -3} (sum = -5) The sum of all elements in both the array will always be 0 (-5 + 5 = 0). The number of elements might be different. Now what is the most efficient way (minimum steps) to neutralize all values? For example one way: -3 + 1 = -2 Now A looks like: {0, 3, 1} and B looks like: {-2, -2} Then -2 + 3 = 1 Now A looks like: {0, 1, 1} and B looks like {0, -2} Now doing 2 more steps. Hence total of 4 steps. Can I compute the most efficient solution for this? How? My take was to neutralize first the exact matching values (makes 2 elements 0 directly). Then look for biggest in positive and start merging with biggest in negative as long as possible. But it is just intuitive thinking from my side. Is there any efficient algorithm to this?","['combinatorics', 'algorithms']"
2240392,Rolling $2$ dice: NOT using $36$ as the base?,"I apologize for such a simple question. It has been a while since I took math classes. When you roll $2$ dice, there are $36$ possibilities. However, there are only $21$ combinations, if order does not matter. Rolling a $(4,2)$ = rolling a $(2,4)$. Let's say in a game, rolling a $(1,1)$ makes you lose. The odds of rolling this is a $1/36$. But why can't you say the probability is a $1/21$, assuming you roll both dice at the same time? There's only one combination that makes you lose, so why can't you use $21$ as the denominator? I have tried searching on this topic, but have not found a good answer. (Most likely because my thinking is fallacious.)","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'probability', 'dice']"
2240401,How to show that some set is open?,"I know my question will sound stupid, that it should be simple, and I know there are already a lot of questions related to this topic, but I've spent hours on it and I still don't get how to show that a given set is open or not . I'm completely stuck and I don't exactly know how I'm supposed to start and proceed. I already looked for other posts about the topic ( like this one , for example, for which I did not manage to understand the answers that were given) but it didn't help. Here is a set for which I'm supposed to determine if it is open or not:
$$U := \{(x_1 , x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_2 > \sqrt{|x_1|} \}$$ What I know (and what I would like to use): Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. A set $U \subset X$ is open if, for all $x \in U$, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r) \subset U$. For a metric space $(X,d)$ with $x \in X$, an open ball $B(x,r)$ is defined as $\{y \in X : d(x,y) < r \}$ The metric $d$ is not specified, so I guess it's the Euclidean metric: for $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2)$, we have $d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2}$. So, if I understand all this properly, what I'm supposed to show is that, for all $x \in U$, there exists (or not) $r$ such that $B(x,r) \subset U$, i.e. such that the elements $(y_1, y_2)$ of $B(x,r)$ are such that $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$. And, since these elements are in $B(x,r)$, they are such that $\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2} < r$. So, if I get this right, the elements $y$ of $B(x,r)$ should be such that $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$ and $\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2} < r$. But then what? I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with all this. How can I ""mix"" those things together so that I have, at the same time, a convenient $r$  and $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$? I'm missing something, but what? Could anyone give me some hints or indications that would help me to get started? I hate to ask for help in such situations, because it looks like I did not even try, but the thing is that I really don't know where to start. Any help would be, therefore, greatly appreciated.",['general-topology']

My attempt: The size of the test = significance level = $\alpha$ = 0.05 From my notes, I am told $\alpha = \pi(H_0)$ , where $\pi$ signifies the power function. The only thing I could think of that might link these together is the z-score formula. $$ Z_{0.05} = 1.65 $$ $$ 1.65 = \frac{\bar x - 1}{1} $$ However this doesn't make sense to me, as when I solve for $\bar x$ I get 2.65, which is greater than $\mu$ , and this region should be less than $\mu$ Am I supposed to derive the power function for $\mu$ myself?",['statistics']
2240579,Idea behind pattern seen in topology,"In topology, I have come across a ""pattern"" that involves a subsequence or subset of a sequence or set. For example, this definition of a second countable space uses: A topological space $T$ is second countable if there exists some countable collection $\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of open subsets of $T$ such that any open subset of $T$ can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of $\mathcal{U}$. Another variant of that ""pattern"" can be found in: Let $\{x_n\}$ be a bounded sequence such that every convergent subsequence converges to $L$. Then $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = L.$ What is the idea behind that pattern of a subsequence/subset of sequence/set? I realize that the two examples are different, I am not saying that they are the same, but it feels to me that they share an important idea of "" a sub-thing of a thing does this or that "" in their construction, and it is that idea/thought process that I'd like to get at. As a bonus question: in which fields/sub-fields of maths is that idea more prevalent/used? Does it show up only in e.g (some branch of) topology, or is it also used in e.g. (some branch of) algebra?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
2240588,"Fourier Series, Sturm-Liouville Problem - What is the connection that I'm missing?","Fourier Series So in my book we are talking about Fourier Series. $$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}a_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left[a_n\sin{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}+b_n\cos{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}\right]$$ It says the represents ""fairly nice"" periodic functions of period $L$. Sturm Liouville Problem A sturm liouville problem is one where $$(p(x)y')'+q(x)y+\lambda w(x)y=0 \qquad p(x),w(x)>0 \qquad \text{on} \qquad x_0 \leq x \leq x_1$$ with Boundary Conditions that allow self-adjointness i.e. Dirichlet, Neumann, Singular POint, Periodic or Radiation. Solution of Sturm Liouville Problem When solving the SL problem, we normally look at  three different values for $\lambda$ ($0,>0,<0$), find the eigenvalues (which are all positive and real), find the eigenfunctions (which are all real) and so if I pick any eigenvalue and its respective eigenfunction, that is a solution to the SL problem (i.e. the Differential Equation with those eigenvalues substituted to lambda has a solution, the eigenfunction, that respects the Boundary Conditions). Connection between the two My book then briefly says that ""$\sin{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}$ and $\cos{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}$ are eigenfunctions of the SL problem $y''+\lambda y=0$ on $[-L,L]$ with periodic BCs. And that $$\left\{1, \sin{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}, \cos{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}\right\}$$ form an orthogonal basis for the space of $2L$ -periodic ""nice"" functions."" My trial So I tried, using $w(x)=1$, $q(x)=0$, $p(x)=1$, on $[-L,L]$ with $y(-L)=y(L)$ and $y'(-L)=y'(L)$ $\lambda =0$ gives $y=Ax+B$ and applying the conditions gives $A=0$. However doesn't tell us anything about B. $\lambda=-\mu^2$ ($\mu\neq 0$) gives $y=Ae^{\mu x}+Be^{-\mu x}$ and applying the conditions gives only the trivial solution $y\equiv 0$ $\lambda=\mu^2$ ($\mu\neq 0$) gives $y =A\sin{(\mu x)}+B\cos{(\mu x)}$ and applying the conditions gives$\mu=\frac{n\pi}{L}$ only. However I don't know how to continue to connect the two. I got another solution from the case $\lambda =0$, how do I unify everything? But in general my question is What is the connection between fourier series and SL problems? How can I show that sin and cos are eigenfunctions of that particular sturm liouville problem? And finally, if that is the case, what are the sturm-liouville's problems associated with sine fourier series and cosine fourier series?","['sturm-liouville', 'fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2240622,Can someone please clarify this proof of the five-color theorem?,"I am having trouble following this proof of the five-color theorem: http://www.unco.edu/nhs/mathsci/facstaff/roberson/Docs/MATH%20695/5%20Color%20Theorem.pdf . (The proof is from pages 1-4.) In particular, I do not understand Case 2 of the inductive step. To give a little background info without following the link, I think the author is trying to show that the boundary of any planar graph can be 3-colored while its interior vertices can be 5-colored. He proves this statement is true by strong induction over the number of vertices. For Case 1 of the inductive step, he shows it is true for graphs with chords. For Case 2, he shows it is true if boundary nodes are connected to interior nodes. Here is the text of the confusing part of Case 2: This $G'$ has an outer boundary defined by the
  following $B' = (B\setminus\{v_0\}) \cup \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_t\}$. We know by our second assumption that $|C(v_0)| \geq 3$,
  and that there must exist two colors $\gamma$ and $\delta$ in $C(v_0)$
  that are different from $\alpha$. Now we want to
  remove the colors $\gamma$ and $\delta$ from the color sets for
  each of the vertices $v_1, \dots, v_t$ since we know that $v_0$
  will have one of those two colors. Thus, we can
  think that if $C(v_i)$ was the original color sets for
  the vertices $v_1, \dots, v_t$, their new color sets will be
  of the form $C(v_i) \setminus \{\gamma, \delta\}$. The remaining vertices in $G'$
  that did not share a common edge with $v_0$ may
  maintain their original color sets in $G'$. Now $G'$
  satisfies all three of our assumptions, and is
  therefore 5-list colorable by induction. Then we can return to our graph $G$ and choose $v_0$ to be
  color $\gamma$ or $\delta$, a color different from $w$, and show that $G$ must also be 5-list colorable. Why are vertices in $G$ that did not share an edge with $v_0$ allowed to keep their color? We haven't proven the hypothesis for $G$, so what if they are colored with a color that isn't $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, or $\gamma$? Then adding $v_0$ back would mean $G$ has 4 colors on its boundary. If $w$ is colored $\gamma$ or $\delta$, and $v_0$ is added back, then wouldn't $w$, $v_0$, $x$, and $y$ be 4 different colors? What exactly is the color set of a vertex? Why can we simply say $v_1, \dots, v_t$ are different colors than $v_0$? Don't we have to prove that's possible? Why can't we also say $w$ is a different color than $v_0$? I'm simply left really, really confused by this proof, even after looking through the examples. I've searched online for another version, but this appears to be the only one.

First I tried to iterate the softplus function $f(x)=\ln(e^x+1)$, which wasn't hard. By a preexisting theorem, any function of the form $g(h(g^{-1}(x)))$ iterated $n$ times is given by $g(h^n(g^{-1}(x)))$, so the nth iterate of the softplus function is given by $f^n(𝑥)=\ln(e^x+n)$. I've been mostly focused on functional square roots (a half-iteration of a function), and in this case, the functional square root was $\ln(e^x+\frac{1}{2})$. Then I tried iterating a very similar function: $f(x)=-\ln(e^x+1)$. This proved to be much more difficult, because in order to put it in the form $g(h(g^{-1}(x)))$, I have to let $h(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}$. Then, to find the functional square root, I would have to find the functional square root of $h(x)$. So far, I haven't been able to do this, but I've convinced myself that the answer will contain imaginary exponents.

I know that a positive integer is divisible by 2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. And because 4, 6, and are multiples of 2 they should also be divisible. However I can't find why it wouldn't be divisible by 6? Here's my proof so far for divisibility by 2: 10 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0.
So 10 ≡ 0 (mod 2). Then 10k ≡ 0
k ≡ 0 (mod 2) for k = 1, 2, 3, . . .. so
x ≡ a0 + a1 · 0 + a2 · 0 + a3 · 0 + a4 · 0 + · · · + am · 0
≡ a0 (mod 2). Therefore x is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit a0 is divisible by 2, which
happens if and only if the last digit is one of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
a0 is the digit in the one's place, a1 in the ten's place etc.","['discrete-mathematics', 'divisibility', 'decimal-expansion', 'elementary-number-theory']"

2240924,Countability of $\{S\subseteq \Bbb Q:\;\text{S is finite}\}$,"I was given the following problem on a test and provided the proof below. My professor says there is an error in my logic (which I'll identify later) but I respectfully disagree and am looking for a second opinion. I'm asked to consider the following set $A$ and prove that $|A|=|\Bbb Q|$. $$A=\{S\subseteq \Bbb Q:\;\text{S is finite}\}$$ To show that $|A|\ge|\Bbb Q|$, I said consider the following subset $B$ of $A$: $$B=\{S\subseteq \Bbb Q: |S|=1\}$$ The set $B$ consists of elements which are sets of cardinality $1$. This means $\forall\;x\in \Bbb Q$, $\{x\}\in B$. Since $B\subseteq A$, $|A|\ge|\Bbb Q|$. She gave credit for this part, but the next was where we disagreed. To show $|A|\not>|\Bbb Q|$, I offered the following: Consider a finite subset of $\Bbb Q$ with cardinality $\le n$. This subset is comparable to an ordered pair in $\Bbb Q^n$. E.g. if $n=4$, we have the following: $$\{a,b,c,d\}\text{ is comparable to } (a,b,c,d) \text{ in }\Bbb Q^4$$ For subsets of cardinality $p$ less than four, I said one could simply repeat the last entry $n-p$ times since sets require unique elements but ordered pairs do not. $$\{a,b\}\text{ is comparable to }(a,b,b,b)\text{ in }\Bbb Q^4$$ In each case , the ordered pair in $\Bbb Q^n$ is unique, implying injectivity. Thus, my solution simply found an injection from $A$ to $\Bbb Q^n$ and utilised the fact that the Cartesian product of countable sets is countable to show that $|A|\le|\Bbb Q|\implies|A|=|\Bbb Q|$. However, my professor claimed that this does not necessarily hold for sufficiently large $n$. She compared my work to the false proof that the sum of naturals is finite because each time you add the next natural to the previous sum, you're adding a finite number to a finite sum. I disagree because no matter how large $n$, this is still comparable to $\Bbb Q^n$. I normally would never have the confidence to disagree with her as she's an extremely good professor, but I feel like my approach is valid and want to see if anyone else does.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

I've computed it numerically and getting something close to normal distribution with peak at zero, but with different dispersion on sides of $x=0$. How to get it analytically? The provided answer seems ok, but I hope I can find some smooth function for it. Maybe with another type of solution.

$$P_{n+1} (x) - P_{n} (x) = p_1 [P_n(x-\delta x) - P_n(x)] + p_2 [P_n(x+\delta x) - P_n(x)] - q\cdot P_{n}(x)$$
Dividing by $\delta n$ and $\delta x$ getting something like:

In addition, I have i.i.d. random variables $Y_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) that are also normally distributed, but with mean $\mu_Y$ and variance $\sigma^2_Y$.  Typically, $\mu_X > \mu_Y$, and we can assume that's the case in this question. I'm interested in the distribution of $X$'s rank within the $Y_i$—effectively, the number of $Y_i$ that are greater than $X$.  Is there a straightforward way of obtaining even an approximate expression for this? There is this question , but I'm not sure that's really sufficiently close to the same question.  For one thing, it concerns only two samples, one drawn from each distribution, and for another, it gives only the probability that $X > Y$.  This is of limited use in determining the distribution of $X$'s rank, since the event $X > Y_i$ is not in general independent of the event $X > Y_j$.

2241082,Sample Space as the image of a Random Variable?,"My understanding is that a random variable $X$ is a function that goes from a sample space $\Omega$ to a measurable space $E$, where $\Omega$ is part of a probability space (along with a sigma-algebra $F$ and a measurable function $\mu$) and where $E$ is tipically $\mathbb R$. A sample space is a set of all the possible  ""outcomes"" that may arise in an experiment, $F$ could be thought of as a set of ""events"" (which are, in turn, sets of outcomes), and $\mu$ is a measure used to assign probabilities to events in $F$. I am not a mathematician , and I only have very superficial knowledge of Probability Theory and Measure Theory. Nonetheless, I am interested on having a general intuition of the concepts I've mentioned above, and to learn how to correctly use the vocabulary of Probability and Statistics. Thus, I am concerned about the way the terms ""Outcome"" and ""Sample Space"" seem to be used in different places; particularly when it's implied that the codomain or the image of $X$ is the Sample Space of $X$ , and/or that $X$ ""takes the values of"" the ""outcomes"" (which I believe are both wrong given the definitions above). Some examples include: Wikipedia's article on ""Random Variates"": A random variate is a particular outcome of a random variable Reading ahead it's clear what they mean: that a Random Variate is a particular value that a r.v. can take. Thus, that sentence says that an ""outcome"" is a possible value for a r.v., and not a value where the r.v., as a function, is evaluated. An answer at Cross Validated, on the nature of ""Sample"" and ""Outcome"": So the Sample Space will be ""{Heads, Tails}"", which will be the domain of the random variable, while the ""outcome space"", its range, will be {5,17} Since the ""outcome space"" is the range of a r.v., then ""outcomes"" are elements of the range and not of the domain, according to his definition. Wikipedia's article on PDF's : In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as […] I always thought intuitively that a PDF helps in solving problems like finding the probability that $ X \le k $, by making integrals from minus infinity to k. Thus, the domain of a PDF is the image of X, and not the domain of X, right? The one that confused me the most (although I can't find it now) was one that said something along the lines of ""X is a discrete r.v. if its sample space is discrete"". I believe that's totally wrong if we define the sample space of X as its domain! So my conclusion is that it's extremely common to find the terms ""sample space"" and ""outcome"" used to refer to the image of a random variable and its possible values. Nonetheless, that usage is fundamentally different from the one used in more ""formal"" treatments of probability theory, and one must be always alert as to what definition is being used . So my questions are: Is my conclusion right, or am I missing something? Is it possible to define a r.v. where both its domain and its image are the same sample space? I'm unsure if that even makes sense, but that may make it acceptable to say things like the ones I've cited. I'm specially interested in that if $\Omega$ and $E$ can both be $\mathbb R$?! Is it possible to make a probability space ""around"" $E$ (the codomain of X)? So that $E$ is also a Sample Space? Thanks!","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

The proof is very elegant, but there are a few (hopefully trivial) things near the end that are confusing me. Let me recall some notation and details in the proof. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $x\in M$ a basepoint. Let $G=\pi_1 (M,x)$. We denote the vector space of of iterated integrals on $M$ of length (number of differentials in the integrand) less than or equal to an integer $s$ by $B_s (M)$, and the vector subspace of those that are homotopy functionals by $H^0 (B_s (M),x) = H^0 (B_s (M))$ (all of this notation comes from the bar construction ). Let $J$ be the augmentation ideal of the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$. Chen's theorem asserts that for every $s\geq 0$ the integration map $$H^0 (B_s (M)) \to \text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}} (\mathbb{Z}[G]/J^{s+1}, \mathbb{R}), \quad [\omega_1 \vert \dots \vert \omega_r]\mapsto \left(\gamma\mapsto \int_\gamma \omega_1\dots\omega_r \right)$$ is an isomorphism. (This can be interpreted as giving a canonical isomorphism between Betti and de Rham Tannakian fundamental groups after base change). Let $R$ be a ring and $V = R[G]/J^{s+1}$. Assuming $G$ is finitely generated, $V$ is finite-dimensional. Hain shows that right translation on $V$ is a unipotent representation of $G$. We have a filtration of subspaces $$V\supseteq J/J^{s+1}\supseteq J^2/J^{s+1}\supseteq \dots \supseteq J^s/J^{s+1}\supseteq 0, \quad (*)$$ and $G$ acts trivially on the graded quotients $J^t/J^{t+1}$. We form a flat line bundle $E\to M$ where $E=(V\times \tilde{M})/G$, and since $G$ stabilises $(*)$, this bundle inherits a filtration by flat subbundles $$E\supseteq E^1\supseteq E^2 \supseteq \dots \supseteq E^s \supseteq 0,$$ with the fiber of $E^t$ equal to $J^t/J^{s+1}$. Hain shows that each of these flat connections can be trivialised. Now comes the part I am confused about. Define $\text{End}_J (V)$ to be the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of $V$ that preserve the flag $(*)$. There are two confusing things: Hain claims that every element of $\text{Hom}_J (V)$ satisfies $A^{s+1}=0$. I don't see why this is the case - for example, why is the identity map not in $\text{End}_J (V)$? Secondly, parallel transport $T$ of the connection on $E$ is shown to be an element of $H^0(B_s (M))\otimes \mathbb{R}[G]/J^{s+1}$. Then it is claimed that integration $\gamma\mapsto T(\gamma)$ (parallel transport of the connection along $\gamma$) induces the identity map on $\mathbb{R}[G]/J^{s+1}$. I really don't understand where this step came from, and would be grateful if anyone can shed some light on this.

In a 10-member family, what is the probability that the birthdays of the members include all seven days of the week? My solution: All possible combinations are equal to $7^{10}$, which is akin to the problem of distributing $10$ different objects into 10 distinct boxes with repetitive objects allowed. Now, we select $7$ objects (i.e., people) ${10 \choose 7}$, put them in the boxes (i.e., days) so that we have at least one birthday on each day. Accounting for  internal permutation, we have ${10 \choose 7}\cdot7!$ Three objects are left. These could be put in the same box or in different boxes. We break down the possibilities: All three in different boxes. We have $7$ choices for the first object, $6$ for the seven and $5$ for the third. In other words,  ${7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 1}\cdot {5 \choose 1}$. Now, we have three $2$-member boxes each having a $2!$ internal permutation. Hence, we have $$\frac{{7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 1}\cdot {5 \choose 1}}{2!\cdot2!\cdot2!}$$ Two  in the same box. We choose a pair put them in any of the seven boxes and there's six choices for the remaining object. Again, factoring in repeated cases, we get $$\frac{{3 \choose 2}\cdot {7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 1}}{3!\cdot2!}$$ All three one the same  day. This is easy: $$ \frac{{7 \choose 1}}{4!}$$ Now, employing the rule of sum (since the above cases are mutually exclusive), we compute the probability $$ \frac {{10 \choose 7} \cdot 7! \cdot  [\frac{{7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 1}\cdot {5 \choose 1}}{2!\cdot2!\cdot2!} + \frac{{3 \choose 2}\cdot {7 \choose 1}\cdot {6 \choose 1}}{3!\cdot2!} +\frac{{7 \choose 1}}{4!}]} {7^{10}} $$
   which is almost $0.08$. Also, can you think of a better, more systematic (or perhaps general) solution for the above problem? I suspect there's one and that this could be done through computing the complement cases. I have been trying to no avail. I can't eliminate repetitive distributions.

2241608,Solving $x^{3} - 2 = 0$ and the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$,"Let's start with a simple polynomial $f(x) = x^{3} - 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. It is known that $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and hence without any further information (i.e. working in field $\mathbb{Q}$ and ring $\mathbb{Q}[x]$) we can not distinguish the $3$ roots of $f$. The distinction between roots is only possible once we have the splitting field of $f$ available . Now consider the quotient $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ which is a field (because $f$ is irreducible) and this field contains a member $x + (f(x))$ which is a root of $f(x)$. Moreover this field is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\subset \mathbb{R}$. Why is this extension field obtained using quotient by $(f(x))$ give us the real root $\sqrt[3]{2}$ and not one of the other two roots? I mean while taking the quotient with $f$ we are just getting an extension field which depends on $\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(x)$ and we don't know for sure which of the three roots it will contain. The same question however does not apply to all irreducible polynomials. Thus if we take $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1$ (or more simply $x^{2} + 1$) then $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ contains all the roots of this polynomial. Update : For the simple polynomial $x^{2} + 1$ I can show that both of its roots are in the extension field $\mathbb{Q}[x] / (x^{2} + 1)$. With some reasonable effort we can show the same for $f(x) = x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1$. I think we can also show that for $f(x) = x^{3} - 2$ the field $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$ has only one root (I have not yet proved this for myself but I am sure I can). My real question is that even if we assume that this field has only one of the roots how do I know that this particular root is special and other two roots are more of a similar nature (ie this one is real and others are complex conjugates)? It appears I have been misunderstood so I add more formalism and details. Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{3} - 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. So $K$ has three elements $a, b, c$ each of which is a cube root of $2$ in $K$. Also we have $$K \supset \mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{3} - 2) = L \supset \mathbb{Q}$$ My point is that the roots $a, b, c \in K$ are not indistinguishable from each other. Precisely we have one of these (say $a$) in $L$ and rest two ($b, c$) in $K$. Also there is automorphism $\sigma$ of $K$ which fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\sigma(b) = c$. But there is no automorphism of $K$ which fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ and sends $a$ to $b$ (or $c$). I know this only by working in field $\mathbb{C}$. How do I know this without working in $\mathbb{C}$? Thanks to DonAntonio, I understood the flaw in my reasoning. Also sorry to other people who answered for bearing with my nonsense comments. What I gather from the overall discussion is this: Summary : The cubic $x^{3} - 2$ has three roots and they all lie in splitting field $K$. The intermediate field $L = \mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{3} - 2)$ contains only one of the roots (see last part of egreg's answer as to why $L$ can't have all the roots) and it is not possible to determine via algebra as to which of $a, b, c$ lie in $L$. Thus $a, b, c$ are indeed indistinguishable and any one (say $a$) can be supposed to lie in $L$ and the rest lie in $K$. And we can then prove that $K = L(b) = L(c)$ and $L = \mathbb{Q}(a)$ and $L$ is of degree $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ is of degree $2$ over $L$. I think it is now easy to get the Galois group and show that it is indeed $S_{3}$.",['abstract-algebra']
2241655,Maximum entropy principle for Poisson distribution,"I know that certain probability distributions may be derived from the requirement that entropy be maximal along with a constraint such as fixed variance. In the case of fixed variance, for example, one finds the normal distribution . In particular, the maximisation is over the set of all (!) continuous PDFs with that fixed variance. Now my question is, is there a similarly general derivation of the Poisson distribution as a maximum entropy distribution? E.g. fixing that mean and variance are equal and maximising entropy? I have found a couple of articles but they always seem to prove maximality on a restricted set of discrete PDFs. Is it because there is no more general maximum entropy principle for the Poisson distribution? If so, is it because the discrete case is simply more complex than the continuous one?","['entropy', 'probability']"

I tried to find some hints or help online, but so far I haven't found anything. So I figured I'd see if someone could help me here. So the problem is the following: We have to use a proof by cases, one with an even number of observations and one with an odd number of observations in our sample, that the $\alpha$-truncated mean converges to the median, as $\alpha \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$. As the course is in German, and I'm not sure about the English term for this mean, I'll also leave the definition here. It also contains the problem I have with this proof: $$x_{t,\alpha} := \frac{1}{n-2k}\sum^{n-k}_{j=k+1}x_{[j]} $$
with $0 < \alpha < 1/2$ and $k:= \lfloor n\alpha \rfloor$, and where our sample $(x_{[1]},\dots,x_{[n]})$ is already ordered. Now, I am just looking for a starting point, not a complete solution, after all I would really love to figure it out by myself - at least partially.

Unfortunately it took me a lot of time to derive and thoroughly check the result even though all the calculations are at elementary level. It is always helpful to use Mathematica. Indeed for particular values of $a$ Mathematica ""after long thinking"" comes up with solutions however from that it is hard to find the generic result as given above. Besides in more complicated cases Mathematica just fails. In view of the above my question is the following. Can we prove that every infinite sum whose coefficients represent a rational function in $m$ and in addition involve products of positive powers of generalized harmonic numbers, that such a sum is always always given in closed form by means of elementary functions and poly-logarithms?

For example the reasonable-looking function $x \mapsto (x,x,\ldots)$ is not continuous when the codomain carries the box topology.

Simply write $F(x) = (f_1(x),f_2(x),\ldots)$ then check all $f_i \colon \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ are continuous. This condition is necessary and sufficient. Is there a simple characterisation of exactly which functions are box-continuous? Failing such a characterisation, could someone provide me with a large family of box-continuous functions?

Now, lets change $\alpha$ for $\alpha (t)$ with $\alpha (t) \in A,\forall t$. Can we ensure (under some conditions on $f$ and $\alpha (t)$) that the equilibrium ""will turn"" into a trajectory $e(t)$ which attracts solutions (locally) of the non-autonomous equation $\dot{x}=f(\alpha(t),x)$ (forward or in a pull-back sense)? In particular, I'm working with a system for which I know the equilibriums for $\alpha \in A$. And if I change $\alpha$ for a periodic function, I can prove (using degree theory) that a periodic solution exists, provided $\alpha (t) \in A$ and the amplitude of oscillation is small.

Thanks! Edit: Thank you RPA for your answer. My problem is actually a little bit more complex because my system involves time delays. I could write the equations here if you are interested. But basically I have 2 equations which depend on the parameters $\gamma$, $K$, and $\delta$. If they satisfy certain inequalities its not hard to solve for the non trivial equilibrium. And for $\gamma(t)$, $K(t)$, and $\delta(t)$ T-periodic, if the same inequalities hold $\forall t$ then I can probe existence of a non trivial periodic solution. So I believe that if the amplitude of this functions gets small, then this periodic solution should also have small amplitude until it becomes a point.

Here $G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on $n$ vertices where each edge is present independently with probability $p$. Suppose that $p=d/n$ where $d>1$. Show that w.h.p. $G_{n,p}$ contains
  an induced path of length $\sqrt{\log n}$. The only technique for such problems introduced in the book at the point is the second moment method, so I tried that. Recall this method uses the inequality
$$P(X=0)\le \frac{\operatorname{Var X}}{(\mathbb E X)^2}.$$ So, if $X$ counts the number of induced paths of length $\sqrt{\log n}$, and we show that the square of its expectation dominates its variance, we're set. Write $X = \sum_{i\in K} I_i$, where $K$ is the set of possible paths and $I_i$ is an indicator function for the presence of the induced path. We compute $$|K| = \frac{1}{2} \frac{n!}{(n - \sqrt{\log n})!}$$ and the probability of each $I_i$ occurring is $$\mathbb E I_i =p^{\sqrt{\log n}}(1-p)^{\binom{\sqrt{\log n}}{2} - \sqrt{\log n}}.$$ The $(1-p)$ factor tends to a constant, and we get asymptotically that the first moment of $X$ is $\mathbb E X= d^{\sqrt{\log n}}$, which explains why the problem requires $d>1$. However, it seems that the variance won't be small enough to give the result. Since all the $I_i$ are positively correlated, we can get a lower bound by asking what happens in the case where all the $I_i$ are independent. Recall the variance of a binomial variable (such as $I_i$) with expectation $a$ is $a(1-a),$ and here $a$ is $o(1)$ so we get that the variance is approximately $a|K|$. Then $$ \frac{\operatorname{Var X}}{(\mathbb E X)^2} \approx \frac{ |K| a (1-a)}{|K|^2 a^2} \approx \frac{1}{K|a|} = \frac{1}{\mathbb E X}.$$ So ignoring all correlations, we would just barely get the result, since $\mathbb EX$ grows slowly. However, since it grows so slowly, it seems trying to account for all the correlations will inevitably spoil the proof by making the variance too large. Am I on the right track here? Or is another method needed? I'm also curious why $\sqrt{\log n}$ works but something larger like $\log{n}$ doesn't.

By computing the determinant, as was suggested for this related question regarding the cubic case, we can argue that the radius of convergence of the above series must be
$$
\rho=\frac{5}{4^{4/5}}=1.64938\dots

Furthermore, the Lagrange-Bürmann theorem allows us to formally write down a closed form for the coefficients, namely 
$$
a_n=\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}\left(\frac{x}{1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4}\right)^n_{x=1}
$$ 
but this doesn't look very illuminating. (For the case of the cubic equation a slightly more explicit but still cumbersone rewriting was made possible by the simpler form of $a_n$). What I would like to achieve is obtaining $\rho$ from the explicit closed expression for the $a_n$. Therefore I set out to compute some of them. Here they are:
$$
a_1=-\frac{1}{5},\
a_2=-\frac{1}{5^2},\
a_3=-\frac{1}{5^3},\
a_4=0,\\

a_{12}=-\frac{105672}{5^{14}},\
a_{13}=-\frac{175398}{5^{15}},\
a_{14}=0.
$$
The behavior of the $a_n$ for $n=1,\ldots,30$ supports the following conjecture:
$$\boxed{
a_n = -(-1)^{\lfloor n/5\rfloor}\frac{c_n}{5^{\alpha_n}}
}
$$
where
$$
\alpha_n=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5^k} \right\rfloor
$$
and the $c_n$ are nonnegative integer coefficients which are not divisible by $5$ and vanish for $n=5m-1$.
I think that $c_n$ should be something of the form
$$
\frac{1}{4n+1}\binom{5n}{n}
$$
which for $n=4$ goes very near to reproducing $c_8=286$ and has a scaling similar to that exhibited by the $c_n$. This problem is also motivated by this video where it is suggested that the answer can be guessed with some effort by staring at the coefficients hard enough (27.08).

Infinite Probability Question.,"Where $\frac{1}{\infty}$ and $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ are both undefined terms that generally lead to nonsense, I'm wondering if we can assert that...: $$\frac{1+1+1+\cdots}{1+1+1+\cdots} = 1$$ ...or even $$\frac n {1+1+1+\cdots} = 0$$ ...for any natural number $n$.  In terms of infinite probabilities, it might make sense to recognize something like this because then we can differentiate: $$\frac{1+1+1+\cdots}{2+2+2+\cdots} = \frac 1 2\left(\frac{1+1+1+\cdots}{1+1+1+\cdots}\right) = \frac 1 2.$$ I ask because I independently developed the following proof for selecting a natural number using a method where all natural numbers have an equal, however undefined, probability of being selected. Introduction: It is helpful to consider a simple observation pertaining to finite sets in order to get started.  Let $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$.  Let $f(x) = 1$ if $x$ is odd and $f(x) = 2$ if $x$ is even.  Then, function $f$ is a surjection from $B$ onto $A$ that is “uniform” in the sense that selecting an element $x \in B$ uniformly at random will result in the selection of $f(x) \in A$ uniformly at random as well.  Note that in order to do this, we have effectively partitioned $B$ into subsets the same size as $A$ so that we could biject those subsets with $A$.  Likewise, this work shows how we can partition $[ \,0, 1) \,$ into countable sets that are then bijected with the natural numbers.  Consideration is then given to whether selecting an element of $[ \,0, 1) \,$ uniformly at random allows for the selection of a natural number uniformly at random as well. Definitions: Let $V^{( \,0.5, 1) \,}$ be a set containing one and only one element from each Vitali equivalence class on the interval $( \, 0.5, 1 ) \,$ (Vitali equivalence classes are equivalence classes of the real numbers that partition $\mathbb{R}$ under the relation $x \equiv y \iff ( \, \exists q \in \mathbb{Q} ) \, ( \, x - y = q ) \,$).  The axiom of choice allows for such a selection. For any real number $r$, let $d(r)$ equal the one and only one element $v \in V^{( \,0.5, 1) \,}$ such that $r - v \in \mathbb{Q}$. Let $h : \mathbb{N} \longmapsto \mathbb{Q} [ \, 0, 1 ) \,$ (here $\longmapsto$ denotes a bijection). Let $x$ be an element of $[ \,0, 1) \,$ selected uniformly at random. Let $k(x) = \begin{cases}
h^{-1}(x - d(x) + 0.5) && x \geq d(x) - 0.5 \\
h^{-1}((x + 1) - d(x) + 0.5) && x < d(x) - 0.5
\end{cases}$. For each natural number $1, 2, 3, …$, let $V^1, V^2, V^3, \ldots$, respectively, be the sets such that $( \, \forall x \in V^{n} ) \, ( \,k(x) = n ) \,$.  We then have $V^{( \,0.5, 1) \,} = V^{h^{-1}(0.5)}$, for example.  Each $V^{n}$ will be a Vitali set by definition with the collection $\{ V^{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ forming a partition of $[ \,0, 1) \,$. Comments on Uniformity: A uniform distribution is a concept of translation invariance.  For example, if $S$ is a measurable set, we may want the probability of $S$ to be the same as the probability of $\{y : y = z + n, z \in S \}$ for each natural number $n$.  In the case of function $k$ over the domain $[ \,0, 1) \,$, however, we end up mapping each element of each non-measurable Vitali set $V^n$ to a distinct natural number $n$.  Where $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$, it is easy to see that the probability of $x$ falling within $V^a$ is equal to the probability of $x$ falling in $V^b$, but we cannot rely on a Lebesgue measure as a means of establishing probability or creating any sort of cumulative distribution function on $\mathbb{N}$.  The probability of selecting any given natural remains undefined.","['uniform-distribution', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2242821,Tuple-builder notation,"For some function $f : \mathbb{N} \to S$, is there a concise (and preferably established) way to build tuples from sets $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ of the values they map to in $S$?

Let $A = \{1, 5, 6\}$, I'm looking for a way to express the $|A|$-tuple $(f(1), f(5), f(6))$. The tuple $(f(5), f(6), f(1))$ is equally acceptable, but the (multi)set $\{f(1), f(5), f(6)\}$ would not do. If we see tuples as nested ordered pairs $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \equiv (a_1, (a_2, \cdots, a_n))$ with $(a_i)\equiv (a_i, \emptyset)$, I'm essentially looking for notation for the function: $$ g(f, A) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\emptyset & \text{if } A = \emptyset, \\
(f(\min A), g(A \setminus \min A)) & \text{else}.
\end{array}\right.$$ I'm tempted to use notation parallel to the set-builder, i.e., $(f(x) : x \in A)$ but that doesn't really convey that the ordering matter. Edit to clarify the order requirement: The order of the tuple doesn't matter at all, but it matters that it is ordered. In other words, for $f : \mathbb{N} \to S$ and $h : \mathbb{N} \to S$, I want the following property of the notation: $$(f(x) : x \in A) = (h(x) : x \in A) \iff \forall x \in A, f(x) = h(x).$$ Obviously, this property holds for any ordering as long as it only depends on $A$.

2242851,If prime $p=a_n10^n+a_{n-1}10^{n-1}+\ldots+a_110+a_0$ then $f(x)=a_nx^n+\ldots+a_0$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$,"I have been trying to solve this problem on my own for four days now, and I cannot figure out how to prove it: If we express a prime $p$ in base $10$ as
$$p= a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\ldots +a_110+a_0,$$
with $0\leq a_i \leq 9$ for all $i \in [m]$, then the polynomial 
$$f(x)= a_mx^m+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\ldots +a_1x+a_0$$
is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. First, note that $\gcd(a_n, \ldots, a_0)=1$, otherwise $p$ would not be prime. I want to prove this by contradiction. Suppose, to the contrary, that $f(x)$ is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Then there exist $a(x), b(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, neither of which are units, such that $f(x)=a(x)b(x)$. Now $p=f(10)=a(10)b(10)$, which implies that $a(10)\in \{1, -1\}$ or $b(10)\in \{1, -1\}$ (whichever is the case will imply that the other is $\pm p$). Without loss of generality, suppose that $a(10)=1$. Now, I was given the following hint: Show that $f(x)$ takes on infinitely many prime values, that is, show that show that there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of integers such that $f(x_n)=q_n$, where $q_n$ is prime for each $n$. If I can show this, I am done because by the argument made above, without loss of generality, this would imply that $a(x)$ takes on the value 1 infinitely many times. Then $a(x)-1=0$ for infinitely many $x$-values, but since a polynomial has infinitely many zeros if and only if it is the zero function itself, this would imply that $a(x)=1$ for all integers $x$, a contradiction. Can someone help me figure out why the hint is true? Thank you!!

2242859,Paradox: Two completely different values for $\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1-n^2}+\frac{2}{1-n^2}+...+\frac{n}{1-n^2}\right)$,"I am asked to evaluate the following question: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{1}{1-n^2}+\frac{2}{1-n^2}+...+\frac{n}{1-n^2}\right)$$ I did the following: Using the property: Limit of a sum is the sum of limits, I take on each term separately. $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{1}{1-n^2}) = \lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{\frac{1}{n^2}}{\frac{1}{n^2}-1}) = \frac{0}{-1} = 0.$$ Similarly each term evaluates to $0$ despite the dependence on n: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{n}{1-n^2}) = \lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{\frac{n}{n^2}}{\frac{1}{n^2}-1}) = 0.$$ I checked the answer and it said -$\frac{1}{2}.$ I checked the complete solution: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{1}{1-n^2}+\frac{2}{1-n^2}+...+\frac{n}{1-n^2}) = \lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{1+2+...+n}{1-n^2}) = \lim_{n\to\infty}(\frac{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{1-n^2}) = -\frac12.$$ Obviously, only one answer is ryt [hoping that the limit of an expression is a uniques number]. Both the deductions seem quite logical to me. The only plausible mistake i have noticed is $1+2+...+n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is only true for $n$ $\in$ $\Bbb Z$.

2242928,"Understanding ""Equality"" notation in a limit","I am wondering about the word ""equal"" in the context of a limit. When a limit ""equals"" a value, is the expression including the $\lim$ equal to the limiting value in the same sense that $1+1 = 2$? I am not sure if, in the context of a limit, the limiting value is ever reached. If it is never reached, is the expression with the $\lim$ actually equivalent to the limiting value? I am wondering if there are two different types of equality--one in the context of limits and the other in the context of addition. Thank you!",['limits']
