This question is missing context or other details : Please improve the question by providing additional context, which ideally includes your thoughts on the problem and any attempts you have made to solve it. This information helps others identify where you have difficulties and helps them write answers appropriate to your experience level. Closed 7 years ago . Improve this question Let $A$, $B$ be two abelian groups, let $f$ be a group homomorphism from $A$ to $B$. Now we consider $A$, $B$ as $R$-modules over a ring $R$. Show that $f$ is also a module homomorphism between them. I know is clear that $f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)$, but how can I show that $f(ra)=rf(a)$?","['abstract-algebra', 'modules']"
1856918,"Comparing the prime spectra of $\mathbb{Q}[x],\mathbb{R}[x]$ and $\mathbb{C}[x]$","I understand that $\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{Q}[x]=\{(0),(f(x)): f(x)\mbox{ is an irreducible polynomial}\}.$ An argument is the following one: $(0)$ is prime because $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is an integral domain. Since $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a PID (and hence UFD) an ideal $(f(x))$ is prime iff $f(x)$ is prime iff $f(x)$ is irreducible. I have read that $\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{R}[x]=\{(0),(x-a),(g(x)): a\in \mathbb{R}, \ g(x)\mbox{ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 2}\}.$ I understand $(0)$ is prime because $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is integral, and also understand $(x-a)$ is prime (in fact maximal) because the map $$\mathbb{R}[x] \to \mathbb{R}, \ h(x) \mapsto h(a)$$ 
has kernel $(x-a)$. Now I can use the first isomorphism Theorem. For the last part, just as in $\mathbb{Spec}\mathbb{Q}[x]$ case, $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is a PID (and hence UFD), thus an ideal $(g(x)) \subset \mathbb{R}[x]$ is prime iff $g(x)$ is prime iff $g(x)$ is irreducible. My question 1): why $g(x)$ should be of degree exactly 2? I don`t understand what properties of $\mathbb{R}$ creates this restriction, the one that is not in $\mathbb{Q}[x].$ I think I understand the $\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{C}[x]$ case well, namely $\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{C}[x]=\{(0),(x-a):a\in \mathbb{C}\}.$ Just as above $(h(x))\subset \mathbb{C}[x]$ is prime iff $h(x)$ is prime iff $h(x)$ is irreducible. But $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed, hence $h(x) = x-a$ for some $a \in \mathbb{C}.$ In fact this argument holds for $\mathrm{Spec}k[x]$, for any algebraically closed field $k$. My final question (besides the one above) is what is the difference between these three prime spectra in geometric terms?","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

1856935,Fundamental group of the unit tangent bundle on the genus 2 torus?,"I'm interested in the 3-dimensional model geometries; specifically $\widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. I'm looking for a good (see, easily visualizable) example of a compact manifold formed as a quotient of a group acting on $\widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. I'm trying to show that the unit tangent bundle (i.e., the unit vectors on the tangent bundle, so a circle bundle) on the closed 2-dimensional genus 2 surface is such a manifold. I call this manifold $UF_2$. In order to do that, I think I need to show that $\pi_1(UF_2)=\left<a,b,c,d,s\big|[a,b][c,d]=s^k\right>$ where $[a,b]=aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ and $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $k\not=0$. I am using Van Kampen's theorem to calculate $\pi_1(UF_2)$ and I finally got a result. I think that $\pi_1(UF_2)=\left<a,b,c,d,s\big|[a,b][c,d]=s^2\right>$, but I'm not that confident in the result. My application of Van Kampen's theorem involves splitting $UF_2$ into a unit tangent bundle on 2 different punctured tori. But really, I did a lot of hand waving. I couldn't even write down how I arrived at the result $k=2$. So I'm asking: 1 Can anyone confirm, using any method, that $\pi_1(UF_2)=\left<a,b,c,d,s\big|[a,b][c,d]=s^2\right>$? 2 Can anyone confirm that $UF_2$ is a quotient of $\widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ by a isometry group? 3 Can anyone write down an explicit method for calculating $\pi_1(UF_2)$?

1857018,Volume in higher dimensions,"Let me first state the statement which I want to prove (encountered while studying ""Geometry of Number""): Suppose  $A$  is  a convex, measurable, compact and centrally symmetric  subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\mathbf{x}=(x_1, \ldots, x_r, x_{r+1}, \ldots, x_n)\in A$ iff $|x_i|\leq 1$ for $1\leq i \leq r$ and $x_{r+1}^2 + x_{r+2}^2 \leq 1, \ldots, x_{n-1}^2 + x_{n}^2 \leq 1$ Then $\text{vol}(A) = 2^r \pi^{\frac{n-r}{2}}$ The definition of various terms used above : $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is called a convex set if  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\mathbf{y}$ are  in  $A$  then  so  is  the  entire line  segment  joining  them. Measurable  refers  to  Lebesgue  measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$; the  Lebesgue  measure $\text{vol}(A)$  coincides  with  any  reasonable  intuitive  concept  of  n-dimensional volume,  and  Lebesgue  measure  is  countably  additive. Centrally  symmetric  means  symmetric  around  $\mathbf{0}$:  if  $\mathbf{x}  \in A$ then  so is $-\mathbf{x}$. I have no idea about how to approach this problem.

1857026,Checking nature of angles of a triangle given the equations of the three lines that form a triangle,"Suppose we have three lines $\ell_i=a_ix+b_iy=c_i$, $i=1,2,3$ and we are given that they form a triangle. I need to find
which angles are acute and which are obtuse without plotting the lines
graphically (not even roughly). What would be the best method to do so? I vaguely remember a method I saw in a book but can't find it now. Most probably it told to find out the $\tan$ values of the angles to check if they are acute or obtuse. I don't think that's correct however, because there can be two angles between a pair of lines. One acute and one obtuse. So I'm a bit confused. N.B. I am in high school and am not familiar with inner products yet.","['analytic-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"
1857033,"Show differentiability of $f(x) = \sqrt{x^4 + y^4}$ in $(0,0)$","I'm trying to show the differentiability of $$f:\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R\text;\quad f(x) = \sqrt{x^4 + y^4}$$
in (0,0).
Here's my attempt: Since $\partial_xf(x,y) = \frac{4x^3}{2\sqrt{x^4+y^4}}$ we would divide be zero plugging in (0,0), so we need to compute the limit manually (same holds for $\partial_y f(x,y)$). Doing that, we get $$\lim \limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(h,0) - f(0)}{h} = \lim \limits_{h\to 0} \frac{h^2}{h} = \lim \limits_{h\to 0} h = 0$$
(analog for $\partial_y f(x,y)$), hence $\partial_xf(0,0) = 0$. Now it remains to show that $\partial _xf(x,y)$ (resp. $\partial_yf(x,y)$ is continuous. This is true since $$\lim \limits_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \partial_xf(x,y) = \lim \limits_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}  \frac{4x^3}{2\sqrt{x^4+y^4}} = 0 = \partial_xf(0,0)$$
(analog for the partial to y). Since both partials exist and are continuous, we're done. Now, is that attempt correct? If yes, did I do something I didn't necessarily have to do? Are there better/faster/easier methods to proof differentiability? ADDITIONAL QUESTION: I did not prove that $\lim \limits_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}  \frac{4x^3}{2\sqrt{x^4+y^4}} = 0$.

1857078,Trace norm of a triangular matrix with only ones above the diagonal,"For $n\in\mathbb N^*$, we consider the triangular matrix
$$
T_n = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \cdots & 1 \\
  & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 &  & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\in M_{n,n}(\mathbb R)
\,.
$$
The trace norm of $T_n$, that is the sum of the singular values of $T_n$, is denoted by $\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}$. Is it true that
$$
\sup_{n\in\mathbb N^*} \Big\{\frac{1}{n}\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}\Big\} < \infty \,?
$$ EDIT Is it true that
$$
\sup_{n\in\mathbb N^*} \Big\{\frac{1}{n\log(n)}\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}\Big\} < \infty \,?
$$ An equivalent definition of the trace norm is $\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}:=\text{Tr}[\sqrt{T_n^T T_n}]$, where the square root $\sqrt{A}$ of a nonnegative matrix $A$ is the only nonnegative matrix such that $\sqrt{A}^2=A$. (And by $A$ nonnegative I mean $⟨u,Au⟩\geq0$ for all vector $u\in\mathbb R^n$). EDIT 2 One can explicitly compute the singular values of $T_n$. $$T_n^{-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1 & & 0 \\
  & \ddots & \ddots & \\
 & & \ddots & -1 \\
0 & & & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\in M_{n,n}(\mathbb R)
\,.
$$ The singular values $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$ of $T_n$ are related to those, $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$, of $T_n^{-1}$ through $\sigma_j=\lambda_j^{-1}$. It is easier to compute the singular values of $T_n^{-1}$ because the eigenvalues $\mu_j=\lambda_j^2$ of
$$A_n = (T_n^{-1})^* T_n^{-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
  1    &    -1  &        &        &     0  \\
 -1    &    2   &  -1    &        &        \\
       &    -1  & \ddots & \ddots &        \\
       &        & \ddots & \ddots &    -1  \\
  0    &        &        &    -1  &     2
\end{pmatrix}
\,,$$
can be computed explicitly (as for the discrete laplacian). Eigenvalues of $A_n$ First, $A_n$ is real symmetric, hence it can be diagonalized in an orthonormal basis, and its eigenvalues $\mu_j$ are real. Then using, say, Gershgorin's circle theorem , the eigenvalues are in the interval $[0,4]$. If $\psi=(\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n)^T$ is an eigenvector of $A_n$ associated with the eigenvalue $\mu$, then
\begin{align}
\psi_2 & = (1-\mu)\psi_1 & (1) \\
\psi_3 & = (2-\mu)\psi_2 - \psi_1 & (2)\\
 & \vdots \\
\psi_{j+2} &=  (2-\mu)\psi_{j+1} - \psi_j & (j)\\
 & \vdots \\
\psi_n & = (2-\mu)\psi_{n-1} - \psi_{n-2} & (n-1)\\
(2-\mu)\psi_n &= \psi_{n-1} & (n)
\end{align}
From Eq. $(2)$ to $(n-1)$, one can see that $\psi_j$ is linear, recursive sequence of order two. Since the roots of the polynomial $X^2+(\mu-2)X+1$ are
$$\frac{2-\mu\pm i \sqrt{\mu(4-\mu)}}{2}=e^{\pm i\theta}$$
with $\theta\in [0,\pi]$ and $\cos(\theta)=1-\frac{\mu}{2}$, $\psi_j=\Re(a e^{i(j-1)\theta})$ with $a$ a complex number. Up to a (real) normalization factor $\psi_j=\Re(e^{i(\varphi+(j-1)\theta)})$ for some $\varphi\in\mathbb R$. Using $\mu = 2-e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta}$ and Eq.(1) and (n), yields
\begin{align}
e^{i(\varphi+\theta)}+e^{-i(\varphi+\theta)}&=(e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}-1)(e^{i\varphi}+e^{-i\varphi}) \\
(e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta})(e^{i(\varphi+(n-1)\theta)}+e^{-i(\varphi+(n-1)\theta)})&=e^{i(\varphi+(n-2)\theta)}+e^{-i(\varphi+(n-2)\theta)}
\end{align}
i.e.
\begin{align}
\cos(\varphi-\theta)&=\cos(\varphi) & (1)'\\
\cos(\varphi+n\theta)&=0 & (n)'
\end{align}
From $(1)'$, either $\theta=0$ or $\varphi = \frac{\theta}{2}+k\pi$. $\theta=0$ would give $\mu=0$ which is excluded since $A_n$ is an invertible matrix. Hence using $\varphi = \frac{\theta}{2}+k\pi$ and $(n)'$:
$$(n+\frac{1}{2})\theta=(k+\frac{1}{2})\pi$$
Using that $\theta\in[0,\pi]$, we get that $\theta\in \Big\{\frac{j-\frac{1}{2}}{n+\frac{1}{2}} \pi \mid j=1,\dots,n\Big\}$. And in fact each of these values yields an eigenvalue and an eigenvector. The corresponding eigenvalues are $\mu_j=4\sin^2\Big(\frac{j-\frac{1}{2}}{n+\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\pi}{2}\Big)$, $ j=1,\dots,n$. Trace Norm of $T_n$ The singular values of $T_n$ can now be deduced:
$$\sigma_j=\frac{1}{2\sin\Big(\frac{j-\frac{1}{2}}{n+\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\pi}{2}\Big)}\,,\quad  j=1,\dots,n$$
and the trace norm is
$$ \|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{\sin\Big(\frac{j-\frac{1}{2}}{n+\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\pi}{2}\Big)} \,.$$ Using that $\sin x\geq \frac{2}{\pi}x$ on $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ one gets the upper bound :
$$ \|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}\leq \frac{n+\frac{1}{2}}{2}\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{j-1/2}\leq \frac{n+\frac{1}{2}}{2} \Big(\frac{1}{2}+\ln(2n+1)\Big)\,,$$
which implies that
$$
\limsup_{n\in\mathbb N^*} \Big\{\frac{1}{n\log(n)}\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}\Big\} \leq \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$ Actually one also has a lower bound $$ \frac{n+1/2}{\pi}\Big(\ln(\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}))-\ln(\tan(\frac{\pi}{4(n+1/2)}))\Big)
\leq \frac{n+1/2}{\pi} \int_{\frac{\pi}{2n+1}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{dx}{\sin(x)} 
\leq \|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}} \,,$$
which implies that
$$
\frac{1}{\pi} \leq \liminf_{n\in\mathbb N^*} \Big\{\frac{1}{n\log(n)}\|T_n\|_{\text{Tr}}\Big\} \,.

$$(D\exp)_AX = W_1(1)=\int_0^1\exp((1-s)A)X\exp(sA)\,ds.\tag{2}$$ I believe I have shown $\sum_{k=0}^\infty W_k(t)$ converges by taking the norm of (1) and applying induction, which let me compare the sum to a power series convergent for fixed $t$. I haven't the faintest clue how to show the series converges to $F(t)$ though. I tried converting $\exp$ to a formal sum and showing that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty W_k(t) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty t^j(X+A)^j/j!$, but the fact that $W_k$ is defined via recursive integration makes this difficult. I'm also unsure of how to prove formula (2), since it was unclear to me how to apply the previous parts. I've looked into other ways of proving the result (2), and most of them seem to rely on manipulating a two-parameter family $\Gamma(s,t) = \exp(-sX(t))\,\partial_t\!\exp(tX(t))$.

An so on. Because prime gaps can become arbitrary long for large numbers, there is no way any such sequence will be infinite. On the other hand, they can be very long, I think. What is the longest known sequence of this kind? Can we prove that: There is no infinite sequence of this kind. Or at least that the sum of reciprocals of any such sequence is finite. Of course, we can study such sequences in binary or other bases. Edit The sequence can start with any prime . This link is very relevant. See also the comments. The argument that an infinite sequence like this is unlikely goes like this:
For each new term we have only four possibilities: $$a_{n+1}=10 a_n+b,~~~~b=(1,3,7,9)$$ All of these numbers are contained in a very small interval, about $10$ in size. But the density of primes becomes smaller with growing number of digits, and the gaps become larger. In my opinion, the probability of finding the next term for any such sequence becomes smaller with growing $n$ . It doesn't mean that an infinite sequence is impossible, but I conjecture that it's impossible to prove that any such infinite sequence exists.

  trajectories are bounded on $[0,\infty)$ is either 0 or 1. Can you please
  help me? (The author says that this is a consequence of the zero-one law, but he does not state this zero-one law, so I do not know where it comes from. ) We are working with Lévy-processes with bounded jumps. My attempt: The probility that a trajectory is bounded, is the union of the probability that the trajectory is bounded by an N, that is if $A = \{\omega: |X_t(\omega)| \text{ bounded}\}=\cup_{N \in \mathbb{N}}\{\omega: |X_t(\omega)|<N, \forall t \in [0,\infty)\}=\cup_{N \in \mathbb{N}}A_N$. So one way to finish the proof is to show that for all $N$, $P(A_N)=0$ or $P(A_N)=1$. So we fix N. For every $k>0$ we look at the partition $\{i2^{-k} \}_{i=0}^{\infty}$. This is a finite partition(the idea is to use smaller and smaller partitions, and cádlág-properties). If $\omega \in A_N$, then for every partition we have that $|X_{t_1}|<N, |X_{t_2}-X_{t_1}|<2N,\ldots |X_{T}-X_{t_{n(k)-1}}|<2N$, and conversely I think if this holds for every partition we are in $A_N$, I am a little surte about the converse part, is it true?. Using the independent and stationary increments,the probability for this event is $P(|X_{2^{-k}}|<N)\cdot P(|X_{2^{-k}}|<2N)^{\infty}$. I know that the last part don't really make sense, independence only works for a finite number? Now I am guessing that I need to take the limit in $k$. If I can show that the limit of $P(|X_{2^{-k}}|<N)\cdot P(|X_{2^{-k}}|<2N)^{\infty}$ converges to 0, then I must have that $P(A_N)=0$?, because $A_N$ is contained in the event that for a finite number of partitions points, those points are bounded? But lets say that the expression converges to 1?, then I can not say that $P(A_N)=1$?, or I must argue in some way to do it? And I also do not see how I should deal with the limits to show I get the kind of convergence I want? By stochastic continuity of the Lévy-process, it looks like I am going to get a $1^\infty$-expression, and I don't see how to use l'Hôpital here. end attempt Can you please help me? Either on how to finish the above argument, or another argument?(for instance by a zero-one law if you see what the author may mean?) Update: I have a second attempt using the Kolmgorov zero one law, but I am not able to finish it, do you see how to finish it? start attempt: For each n, define the sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}_n=\sigma(X_t-X_s: n\le s,t\le n+1)$. I think it follows by the independent increments that $\{\mathcal{F}_n\}$ are mutually independent? Assume that for an $\omega$, the trajectory $X(t,\omega)$ is bounded. For any finite interval $[0,B]$ a cádlág function is bounded. So that the function is bounded is a ""tail-event"" in the sense that it only depends on big t. So I must in some way connect this with the tail event $\cap_{n \ge 0}\sigma(\cup_{k\ge n}\mathcal{F}_k)$. Do you see how to do this? That is: $A = \{\omega: \text{There is a B$(\omega)$ and $N(\omega)$ such that }|X(t,\omega)|<N(\omega), \forall t \ge B(\omega)\}\in \cap_{n \ge 0}\sigma(\cup_{k\ge n}\mathcal{F}_k)$.

$$ \forall x \in H , \ \left< x, y_n \right> \to 0, \ n \to \infty $$
$$ \forall m \in \mathbb{N}, \left< x_m, y_n \right> \to 0, \ n \to \infty \text{ and } \{ || y_n ||_H\}_{n=1}^\infty \text{ is bounded}$$
If we assume the first statement then clearly $x_m \in H$ so the first part of the second statement is shown. For the second part of the second statement define a family of operator of the form
$$ T_n (x) = \left< x, y_n \right>$$
Clearly the mapping is linear, and by Cauchy-Schwarz
$$ |T_n (x)| \leq || x ||_H || y_n||_H$$
So the operator is bounded and the norm of the operator is
$$ || T_n ||= || y_n ||_H $$
Applying the principle of uniform boundedness to this family of operators we find that
$$ \exists M > 0, \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \  || T_n || \leq M$$
Since the operator norm coincided with the norm of each $y_n$ we may conclude that the sequence is bounded by $M$. Assume the second statement. Fix $x \in H$ a computation shows
$$ \left< x, y_n \right> = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \left< x_m, x \right> \left< x_m, y_n \right>$$
Now I would like to ""pass the limit"" into the sum but I am unsure how to do this. We can also write $y_n$ in the form
$$y_n = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \left< x_m, y_n \right> x _m$$
Again ""passing the limit"" into the sum would actually give me that $y_n$ converges to $0$ but I cannot make either statement rigorous. Edit : Here is an earlier idea I tried to implement. We have
$$| \left< x, y_n \right> | \leq \sum_{m=1}^\infty | \left< x_m, x \right> |  |\left< x_m, y_n \right> | $$
The series on the right converges, so its tail-end will converge to $0$. In particular for $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $M > 0$ such that
$$ \sum_{m=1}^\infty | \left< x_m, x \right> |  |\left< x_m, y_n \right> | \leq \sum_{m=1}^{M - 1} | \left< x_m, x \right> |  |\left< x_m, y_n \right> | + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} $$
Now by the first hypothesis for $m \in \{1,...,M-1 \}$ there exists $n_m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $n \geq n_m$ we have
$$ |\left< x_m, y_n \right>| \leq \frac{1}{|\left< x_m, x \right>| + 1} \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M - 1)}$$
Now if we choose $N = \max \{ n_m : m \in \{ 1,..., M - 1 \}\}$ then for $n \geq N$ after a simple computation we have
$$ | \left< x, y_n \right> | \leq \varepsilon$$

Three spaceships A, B and C land at random on its surface, their positions being independent and each uniformly distributed on the surface. Spaceships A and B can communicate directly by radio if $\measuredangle AOB < 90^\circ$. Show that the probability that they can keep in touch (with, for example, A communicating with B via C if necessary) is $(\pi + 2)/(4\pi)$. I believe I have shown that the probability is in fact $(2 \pi + 1) / (4 \pi)$. To begin, we denote by $AB$ (resp. $AC$, $BC$) the event that $A$ and $B$ are within $90^\circ$ of each other. We then observe that the probability that communication is possible is given by: $$P(comms) = P(AB \cup (AC \cap BC)),$$ which after some basic manipulation may be re-written as $$P(comms) = P(AB) + P(AC \cap BC) - P(AB \cap AC \cap BC).$$ We then proceed by computing each term on the right-hand side. (A warning that my argument and notation is somewhat loose, and I would appreciate any ideas about tightening it.) For $P(AB)$, we have $$P(AB) = \iint_S P(AB | A = x) \frac{1}{|S|} dS(x),$$ where $S$ denotes the planet's surface and $|S|$ its surface area. By symmetry, we see $P(AB|A) = 1/2$, so that $P(AB) = (1/2)(1/|S|)|S|=1/2$. Next, $$P(AC \cap BC) = \iint_S P(AC|C = x) P(BC|C = x) \frac{1}{|S|} dS(x).$$ By the same argument as above, $P(AC|C) = P(BC|C) = 1/2$, and hence $P(AC \cap BC) = 1/4$. Finally, we have $$P(AB \cap AC \cap BC | A=x) = \iint_{S/x} P(AC \cap BC | A = x, B = y) \frac{1}{2|S|} dS(y),$$ where $S/x$ denotes the hemisphere of $S$ centred on $x$. Now, $P(AC \cap BC|A=x,B=y)$ corresponds to the fraction of $S$ covered by the intersection of $S/x$ and $S/y$. If we define a spherical coordinate system on $S$ with $x$ corresponding to polar angle $\theta = 0$, then this fraction is given by $1/2 - \theta(y)/(2 \pi)$ for $0 \leq \theta(y) \leq \pi/2$ (i.e. $\theta(y)$ in $S/x$), and hence $$P(AB \cap AC \cap BC | A=x) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4\pi}$$ (where I skip performing the double integral above here explicitly for brevity). All up, we then obtain $$P(comms) = \frac{2 \pi + 1}{4 \pi},$$ as stated above, which disagrees with Williams' stated result, although no mistake is obvious to me. Moreover, I have written a Monte Carlo simulator in Python that seems to confirm my result (and which I can provide if anyone would find it useful). In summary, I ask the following: (1) Is Williams correct, or am I?; and (2) How can my argument be made tighter, more rigorous, or more elegant?","['probability', 'geometric-probability']"

Notice, the probability of choosing something divisible by $p$ is $$\frac{1}{2^p}+\frac{1}{2^{2p}}+\frac{1}{2^{3p}}+\frac{1}{2^{4p}}+\ldots=\frac{1}{2^p-1}$$ so the probability of choosing two numbers both divisible by $p$ is $$\frac{1}{(2^p-1)^2}$$ Meaning $$P(a,b;p)=1-\frac{1}{(2^p-1)^2}$$ where $P(a, b;p)$ is the probability that either $a$ or $b$ is not divisible by $p$.  Then the answer I'm looking for is $$P(a,b)=\prod_{p\text{ prime}}P(a,b;p)=\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\left(1-\frac{1}{(2^p-1)^2}\right)$$ where $P(a,b)$ is the probability that $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Anyway, I'm curious about a closed form expression for this number, similar to the original problem I mentioned.  Any insight would be very helpful. Edit As Mark Fischler has pointed out below, this product representation assumes the events of $p|a$ and $p|b$ are independent, which should not be the case.  If anyone can also explain a way of constructing a more correct probability, it would be very helpful.","['infinite-product', 'probability', 'prime-numbers']"

Give an example to prove this contention. It seems pretty easy to me to construct a proof that $B[x]$ is indeed an ideal of $A[x]$, so I would like to know what's wrong with it: First we want to show that $B[x]$ is a subgroup of $A[x]$ under addition: Let $p, q \in B[x]$. To calculate $p+q$ we simply add the corresponding coefficients. Since the coefficients are in $B$ and $B$ is a subgroup, the coefficients of $p+q$ belong to $B$ and so $p+q\in B[x]$. Let $p \in B[x]$. Again, since $B$ is a subgroup, $-p$ is in $B[x]$. Now I show that, given any $p \in B[x]$ and $r \in A[x]$, $pr$ and $rp$ are in $B[x]$. The coefficients of $pr$ are given by $$(pr)_i = \sum_{j+k=i} p_j r_k = \sum_{j=0}^i p_j r_{i-j}$$ Each term of the sum is a product of some $p_j$, which is in $B$, and some element of $A$. Since $B$ is an ideal, all $p_j r_k$ are in $B$, and so is the sum; therefore, $pr \in B[x]$. The same argument works for $rp$. I seem to have proved that $B[x]$ is an ideal of $A[x]$.

How? Let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, $Y=\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, then $\forall\  \emptyset\neq U\subseteq X$ open, $\mathcal{O}_X(U)=\mathbb{Z}$, so that we may let $\varphi$ be the map induced by the canonical homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\to R,n\mapsto \overline{n}=1+\cdots+1$, so that $\varphi(\mathfrak{p}):=\mathfrak{p}^c$. It can be checked that $\varphi$ is continuous, and $\forall\ U\subseteq X$ open, we let $\varphi^\#(U):\mathcal{O}_X(U)\to(\varphi_*\mathcal{O}_Y)(U)=\mathcal{O}_Y(\varphi^{-1}(U))$, with $\varphi^\#(U)(n)=\overline{n}\in\mathcal{O}_Y(\varphi^{-1}(U))$, and it can be checked that this commutes with the restriction homomorphism, and defines therefore a morphism of sheaves. But how do I check that $\varphi$ is unique? My first thought would be a category theoretic proof; clearly, $\mathbb{Z}$ is initial in the category of commutative rings, and it can be shown that $\mathrm{Spec}:\mathbf{CRng}\to\mathbf{AfSc}$ is a contravariant functor; unfortunately this functor is easily seen not to be faithful(*), and is therefore immediately not an equivalence of categories. According to wikipedia, if a functor preserves direct/inverse limits, then it maps initial/terminal objects to initial/terminal objects, respectively. Is there an analogous statement for contravariant functors, and does it apply here? Or is there some other way to prove the result? *Edit: I now realize that statement was incorrect; though two functions might induce the same map on spaces, the maps induced on the entire scheme are nonetheless distinct.

The following is the axiom used: Axiom : There exists a set $\mathbb{N}$ with an element $1 \in\mathbb{N}$ and a function $s: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy the following three properties. There is no n $\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $s(n)=1$. The function $s$ is injective. Let $G\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ be a set. Suppose $1 \in G$, and that if g $\in G$ then $s(g)\in G$. Then $G=\mathbb{N}$. The following is the theorem I want to prove uniqueness for. Theorem : There is a unique binary operation $\circ:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies the following two properties for all $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$. $n\circ 1=n$ $n\circ s(m)=n\circ m +n$ Proof : Suppose there are two binary operations, $\circ$ and $\bullet$, that follow the two properties. Let $G=\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\forall n\in\mathbb{N} (n\circ x=n\bullet x)\}$. It is easy to see $G\subseteq\mathbb{N}$. When $x=1$, $n\circ 1=n=n\bullet 1$ by part 1 of the theorem, so $1\in G$. Suppose $p\in G$, then $n\circ s(p)=n\circ p +n=n\bullet p +n=n\bullet s(p)$ using the 2nd part of the theorem and the induction hypothesis that $n\circ p=n\bullet p$. Since $n\circ s(p)=n\bullet s(p)$, $s(p)\in\mathbb{N}$ Thus, by part 3 of the axiom $G=\mathbb{N}$ which means the two binary operations are the same.
