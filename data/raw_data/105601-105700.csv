1494536,Example of real analytic function,"We were taught real analytic functions in class today. I am playing around trying to construct examples. I see exponential, sine, cosine and logarithmic functions (for $x > 0$). One function I am having trouble with is $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^x}$.

1494565,An issue with the Kuratowski ordered pair definition,"I recently came across the Kuratowski definition of ordered pairs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Defining_the_ordered_pair_using_set_theory ). I'm a bit confused about how the coordinates can be extracted. According to Wikipedia, if we have an ordered pair $p = (a,b) = \{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}$, we can extract the first coordinate with $a = \bigcup \bigcap{p}$ where $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ are arbitrary unions and intersections respectively. According to the definition of an arbitrary intersection, $\bigcap(\{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}) = \{a\}$. $\bigcup\{a\}$ however seems a bit problematic. For the definition of an arbitrary union to work $a$ would have to be a set. What if $a$ is e.g. a natural number? A similar issue occurs with extracting the second pair. Perhaps I'm being overly pedantic or does the definition just automatically assume that $a$ and $b$ are sets?",['elementary-set-theory']

Adams and R. Franzosa says : There are only three three-dimensional geometries that are both homogeneous and isotropic: the Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometries. It has been just written without giving even a little reason(s)/explanation, let alone a proof of it. What is an easiest rigorous proof for the mentioned claim from the book? EDIT - For the definitions of homogeneous and isotropic spaces, I quote it from the same book: To be isotropic means that at each point the geometry appears to be the same in all directions around the point. There is no preferred identifiable direction. This is a property that Euclidean 3-space $E^3$ has, for instance. However, if we form a geometry by taking $S^2 \times E$ , for example, that geometry has different behavior in different directions. To be homogeneous means that locally the geometry of the space is the
same. Given any two points in the space, there is an isometry (a distance-preserving homeomorphism) from a neighborhood of one point to a neighborhood of the other. Thank you.","['3d', 'general-topology']"

1495086,Envelope of Projectile Trajectories,"For a given launch velocity $v$ and launch angle $\theta$ , the trajectory of a projectile may be described by the standard formula $$y=x\tan\theta-\frac {gx^2}{2v^2}\sec^2\theta$$ For different values of $\theta$ what is the envelope of the different trajectories? Is it a parabola itself? The standard solution to this ""envelope of safety"" problem is to state the formula as a quadratic in $\tan\theta$ and set the discriminant to zero. The resulting relationship between $x,y$ is the envelope. This question is posted to see if there are other approaches to the solution. Edit 1 Thanks for the nice solutions from Jack and Blue, received so far.
From the solution of the envelope it can be worked out that the envelope itself corresponds to the right half of the trajectory of a projectile launched at $(-\frac{v^2}{g^2},0)$ at a launch angle $\alpha=\frac{\pi}4$ and a launch velocity $V=v\sqrt2$ . This means that both vertical and horizontal components of the launch velociy are equal to $v$ .

1495100,Can someone provide the formal definition of the tangent line to a curve?,"I was recently explaining differentiation from first principles to a colleague and how differentiation can be used to obtain the tangent line to a curve at any point. While doing this, my colleague came back at me with an argument for which I had no satisfactory reply. I was describing the tangent line to a curve at a specific point in the same way that I was taught at school - that it is a line that just touches the curve at that point and has gradient equal to the derivative of the curve at that point . My colleague then said that for a cubic curve, the line can touch the curve again at other points so I explained the concept again but restricted to a neighbourhood about the point in question. He then came back with the argument of this definition when the ""curve"" in question is a straight line. He argued that in this case the definition of the tangent line as ""just touching the curve at that point"" is simply not true as it is coincident with the line itself and so touches at all points. I had no comeback to this argument at all and had to concede that I should have just defined the tangent as the line passing through the point on the curve that has gradient equal to the derivative at that point. Now this whole exchange left me feeling rather stupid as I hold a Phd in Maths myself and I could not adequately define a tangent without using the notion of differential calculus - and yet when I was taught calculus at school it was shown as a tool to calculate the gradient of a tangent line and so this becomes a circular argument. I have given this serious thought and can find no argument to counter my colleagues observation of the inadequacy of the informal definition in the case when the curve in question is already a straight line. Also, if I do this again in future with another colleague how can I avoid embarrassment again? At what point did I go wrong here with my explanations? Should I have avoided the geometric view completely and gone with rate of changes instead? I am not a teacher but have taught calculus from first principles to many people over the years and would be very interested in how it should be done properly.","['education', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

The dimensions of the crossing support formed by the two boards needs to be exactly 18 inches tall by 15 inches wide. The problem is to figure out the angle to cut the boards at. I have the start to a solution below which involves solving a 4th order polynomial, and I want to make sure I did this the easiest/correct way. Below is my sketch of the solution showing 1 diagonal support and the solution for how long the diagonal edge of the support needs to be (variable x). Work has error, see edit below. So, now that I have x, it is trivial to solve for everything else. A free trial of Mathematica gave me the solution at the end. 4.737 looks like a reasonable length (4.95 is the solution if the angle were 45, so this passes the common-sense check). But that whole solution looks overcomplicated. Is there a simpler way to solve this? EDIT: The error in the above paper work is that I mix up the theta and phi angles in the second drawing (the blow up of the bottom corner that has 3.5 as the hypotenuse). This leads to incorrect sine and cosine substitutions.

1495531,Half Solved: A problem on the heat operator not being elliptic with a weakened version of elliptic regularity,"I should first mention this: in my studies of Sobolev spaces I have completed all the questions of chapter 9 from Folland's real analysis with the help of this site and this is my last one, which is also very interesting, but seemingly difficult so I am posting here in the hopes of getting some help, but I should first mention some notation conventions used here. $ \mathcal{S} $ is the Schwartz class of functions and $ \mathcal{S}' $ is the class of distributions (""generalized functions"") on $ \mathcal{S} $ $ \partial ^ {\alpha} $ is the multi-index distribution derivative on $ L^2 $ $ \Lambda _ s f = { [(1+|\xi|^2)^{\frac{s}{2}} \widetilde{f} ]^{\vee} } $ is a continuous linear operator on the Schwartz distributions. The Sobolev space $ H_s = \{ f \in S' | \Lambda_s f \in L^2 \}  $ Now define the following differential operator $ D^{\alpha} = (2i\pi)^{-\alpha}\partial^{\alpha} $ along with its symbol $ P(D) = \sum_{|\alpha|<m} (2\pi i)^{|\alpha|}a_{\alpha} D^{\alpha} $ , this of course has the property that the Fourier transform of $ P(D)[f] $ is equal to $ P\widehat{(f)} $ And now the elliptic regularity theorem as I know it: Suppose that L is a constant-coefficient elliptic differential operator of order m and $ \Omega $ is open in $ R^n $ and $ u \in D'(\Omega) $ . If $ Lu \in H_{s}^{loc}(\Omega) $ for some $ s \in R $ , then $ u \in H_{s+m}^{loc}(\Omega) $ . Also, if $ Lu \in C^{\infty}(\Omega) $ then $ u \in C^{\infty}(\Omega) $ . I can honestly say this theorem makes sense to me. Now for the exercise at hand: The heat operator $ \partial_t - \Delta $ is not elliptic but a weakened version of the elliptic regularity theorem does hold for it. Here we are workign on $ R^{n+1} $ with coordinates $ (x,t) $ and dual coordinates $ (\xi,\tau) $ , and $ \partial_t - \Delta = P(D) $ where $ P(\xi,\tau) = 2i\pi\tau + 4 {\pi}^2 |\xi|^2  $ . a. There exist $ C,R > 0 $ such that $ |\xi| |(\xi,\tau)|^{\frac{1}{2}} \leq C |P(\xi,\tau)| $ for $ |(\xi,\tau)| > R $ (We are to try to consider the region $  |\tau| \leq |\xi|^2 $ and its complement separately). b. If $ f \in H_s $ and $ (\partial_t - \Delta)f \in H_s $ then we are to show $ f \in H_{s+1} $ and $ \partial _ {x_i} f \in H_{s+(1/2)} $ for $ 1 \leq i \leq n $ c. If $ \zeta \in C_C^{\infty}(R^{n+1}) $ , then we are to show: $ [\partial_t - \Delta,\zeta]f = (\partial_t \zeta - \Delta \zeta)f - 2 \sum{(\partial_{x_i}\zeta)(\partial_{x_i}f)} $ d. We are to show that if $ \Omega \in R^{n+1} $ is open and $ u \in \mathcal{D}'(\Omega) $ and if $ (\partial_t-\Delta)u \in H_{s}^{loc}(\Omega) $ then $ u \in H_{s+1}^{loc}(\Omega) $ .

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $E$ be a vector bundle on it, and $TM$ be the tangent bundle of $M$.
Define a connection $\triangledown $ be a function from $\Gamma(TM,M) \times \Gamma(E,M) \rightarrow \Gamma(E,M)$. Here $\Gamma(-,M)$ is a functor from Vector bundle to its set of global section. So we can think of $\triangledown$ as a function from $\Gamma(E,M)$ to $\Omega^1(M)\otimes \Gamma(E,M)$. Here $\Omega^1(M)$ is the set of differential 1-from on $M$. Let $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ be our principal $G$-bundle.
In principal $G$- bundle setting,
 we can think of connection as a set of subspace $H_p\subset T_pP$ which has dim equals to $\dim M$ or equivalently a connection form $\omega\in \Omega^1(M)\otimes \frak{g}$, where $\frak{g}$ is the lie algebra of the $G$.

1496040,Calderon-Zygmund Operator Associated to Zero Kernel,"We say that a Calderon-Zygmund operator (CZO) $T:L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\rightarrow L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ (i.e. a bounded linear operator) is associated to a CZ kernel $K:\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus\Delta$ ($\Delta$ denotes the diagonal subset) if the following holds: for $f\in L_{c}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ fixed, for almost everywhere (a.e.) $x\notin\text{supp}(f)$,
    $$Tf(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}K(x,y)f(y)dy$$ Suppose that a CZO $T:L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\rightarrow L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is associated the kernel $K(x,y)=0$. In the hint for Question 2 in the Exercises section of Tao's Lecture Notes 4 , he suggests that we can show $T$ is given by pointwise multiplication by a bounded function (i.e. $Tf=bf$, where $b\in L^{\infty}$) by observing that the set function
    $$E\mapsto \langle{T(\chi_{E}),\chi_{E}}\rangle$$
is an absolutely continuous measure and then applying the Radon-Nikodym theorem. I see where the Radon-Nikodym theorem gives us a measurable function $b$ such that
    $$\langle{Tf,f}\rangle=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}b\left|f\right|^{2},\quad\forall f\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$$
by the boundedness of $T$, the density of simple functions in $L^{2}$, and the linearity of the integral. But I am failing to see (perhaps very foolishly) why we can readily deduce that $Tf=bf$ for all $f\in L^{2}$. I believe I can obtain the desired result using a different argument, as shown below; but I would still like to see how to make Tao's suggestion work. Does anyone have a suggestion? Let $g\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ have compact support. For any cube $Q\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
    $$T(\chi_{Q}g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}K(x,y)\chi_{Q}(y)g(y)dy=0 \quad \text{ a.e. } x\notin\overline{Q}$$
and
    $$T(\chi_{Q^{c}}g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}K(x,y)\chi_{Q^{c}}(y)g(y)dy=0 \quad \text{ a.e. } x\in Q^{o}$$
Since $T(\chi_{Q}g)=T(g)-T(\chi_{Q^{c}}g) \text{ a.e. }$, we conclude that
    $$T(\chi_{Q}g)(x)=\chi_{Q}(x)(Tg)(x) \quad \text{ a.e. }$$
Since the collection of all cubes with rational vertices is countable and finite linear combinations of the characteristic functions of such cubes are dense in $L^{2}$, the boundedness of $T$ yields
    $$T(fg)=f(Tg) \quad\text{ a.e. },\qquad\forall f\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$$ To see that $T$ is given by pointwise multiplication by a bounded function $b$, let $B_{j}$ be the ball centered at the origin of radius $j$. Observe that if $j'\geq j$, then $\chi_{B_{j}}\chi_{B_{j'}}=\chi_{B_{j}}$ and therefore
    $$T(\chi_{B_{j}})=T(\chi_{B_{j}}\chi_{B_{j'}})=\chi_{B_{j}}T(B_{j'}) \quad \text{ a.e. }$$
by our previous result. Thus, we can define almost everywhere a measurable function $b$ by
    $$b(x)=T(\chi_{B_{j}})(x), \quad x\in B_{j}$$
For an $f\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, let $f_{j}=f\chi_{B_{j}}$.Then by the continuity of $T$ and a.e. convergence $f_{j}\rightarrow f$

1496524,"Show that $E=\{(x,\alpha)\mid 0\leq \alpha<|f(x)|\}$ is measurable if $f$ is measurable.","I have to show that $E=\{(x,\alpha)\mid  0\leq \alpha<|f(x)|\}$ is measurable if $f$ is measurable. My attempt : If $f=\boldsymbol 1_F$ where $f$ is measurable, then $$E=\big((\mathbb R\cap F)\times [0,1[\big)\cup \big((\mathbb R\cap F^c)\times \{0\}\big)$$
which is measurable since it's intersection, union and product of measurable set. If $f$ is simple (remark that $f$ simple $\iff$ $|f|$ simple) i.e. $$|f|=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\boldsymbol 1_{F_i}$$ where $a_i>0$ and $F_i$ measurable, we obtain in the same way
$$E=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\big((\mathbb R\cap F_i)\times [0,a_i[\big)\cup \bigcap_{i=1}^n \big((\mathbb R \cap F_i^c)\times \{0\}\big)$$
which is also measurable since it's finite union, intersection and product of measurable set. Finally, if $|f|\geq 0$ we have a sequence of simple function $\{\varphi_k\}_{k\in\mathbb N}$ s.t. $$\varphi_k(x)\nearrow |f(x)|\quad\text{ for all }x.$$ Let $$E_n=\{(x,\alpha)\mid 0\leq \alpha\leq \varphi_n(x)\}.$$
Therefore $E_n\subset E_{n+1}$ and thus $E_n\nearrow E$ i.e. $$E=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty  E_n,$$
and since $E_n$ is measurable, the set $E$ is measurable. Is it correct ?","['lebesgue-measure', 'proof-verification', 'measure-theory']"
1496555,Differentiation and second derivative,"Let $f$ be a function continuous on $[0, 1]$ and twice differentiable on $(0,1)$. Suppose that: $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(c) >0$ for some $c \in (0,1)$. Prove that there exists $x_{0}\in(0,1)$ such that $f''(x_{0}) < 0$. I'm not sure how to approach this question. Do I have to use the âmean value theoremâ or is there actually another way to approach this question?",['derivatives']
1496558,Adjoints in Banach spaces,"I been trying to figure out if the construction of the isomorphism between $g(W)$ and $f^{*}(W^{*})$ via  $$B_V(v, g(w)) = B_W(f(v),w) \quad \forall v \in V, w \in W $$ described (at least this is what I think they mean) in the wikipedia page ,
is meaningfull in a Banach space which is not Hilbert. One reason it wouldn't be the lack of existancee of non-degenrate bilinear forms but this is something which I can't manage to establish. Or maybe there is some other reason?",['functional-analysis']
