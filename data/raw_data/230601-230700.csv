4787169,"A ""perfect"" (chess) rating system","Assume we want to have a player rating system with the following conditions: For simplicity, no draws. If A wins against B with ratings $a,b$ , their new ratings are $a'=f(a,b),b'=g(a,b)$ . Most important: Order of games shall play no role. Say, A wins twice (rest analogous): $a''=f(f(a,b),c)=f(f(a,c),b)$ for all $a,b,c$ . If possible, win=lose: $a+b=f(a,b)+g(a,b)$ . I'm quite sure condition(s) 3 is easily to fulfil and has been researched already; can condition 4 and 5 also be fulfilled? At least one trivial solution exists: $a'=a+k,b'=b-k$ with constant $k$ . But I'd rather have an Elo-like $f$ that considers winning is easier the larger $|a-b|$ gets, so $k$ should get smaller.","['puzzle', 'applications', 'functions', 'scoring-algorithm', 'probability']"
4787237,Set of natural numbers that sum to 2023 having the maximum product.,"Suppose I have a multiset of $n$ positive integers $S$ such that $\sum_{s \in S}s = 2023$ and $\prod_{s\in S}s$ is maximum. Then I need to determine the maximum value of this product. My work : Denote by $s_r$ the $r$ th element of $S$ . First, I use the AM-GM inequality and hence obtain that: $
\frac{2023}{n} \geq {\left(s_1\cdot s_2\cdot s_3 \cdots s_n\right)}^{\frac{1}{n}}.$ For the maximum to be achieved, $s_r = \frac{2023}{n} \ \ \ \forall \ r \leq n$ , each of which I call $s$ . Hence, $n = \frac{2023}{s}$ . So, I need to maximise $\prod_{s \in S} s = s^{n} = s^{\frac{2023}{s}}.$ Therefore, $s^n$ is maximised when: $\ln(s) = 1$ Hence, $s^n$ is maximised when $s = e$ . So I suppose that we can use the integer $3$ which is closest to $e$ and use it fill up the set $S$ . But $2023$ is not divisible by $3$ , so all of $s \in S$ can not be $3$ . Clearly, $674$ $3$ s can be used and $1$ $1$ s can be used, hence giving the optimum product to be $3^{674}$ . My questions are: Is my argument for this problem correct? Is the usage of $3$ in order to maximise the product justified by the argument that it is closest to $e$ ? Can the use of derivatives be avoided? Any help and insight will be appreciated. Edit : $S$ was supposed to be a multiset â€” not a set. I apologize for any confusions caused. Nevertheless, those answers which worked with $S$ as a set are still very helpful to me and other users for they answer a similar question. So I encourage not deleting them.","['optimization', 'calculus', 'inequality']"
4787297,How to integrate the above integrand? Please help me out.,"How to integrate $$\int_0^1 \frac{x^{49}}{1+x+x^2+\cdots+ x^{100}}\;dx$$ I am trying by breaking the summation in the denominator. $$\sum_{i=0}^{100} x^i=\frac{1-x^{101}}{1-x}$$ Therefore the above integrand will become $$\frac{x^{49}(1-x)}{1-x^{101}}$$ But how to approach further? As far as I can guess  the only way to proceed after this is by applying the Maclaurian series expansion of $1/(1-x)$ ; which is $$\sum_{i=0}^n x^i$$ . But the Series expansion of $1/(1-x)$ is applicable only when $-1 \le x \lt 1$ . In the integration, the limit is from $0$ to $1$ , i.e. we have to find the area in the interval $[0,1]$ . So, how to proceed further? Please help me out.","['calculus', 'definite-integrals']"
4787351,Leavitt Path Algebras and Direct Sum,"Let $A$ be an abelian group and $B, C$ be two subgroups of $A$ such that $A=B\oplus C$ . Consider the canonical inclusions and projections $p_C,p_B,\pi_C,\pi_B$ . We have the following relations: $\pi_Bp_B=1_B$ , $\pi_Cp_C=1_C$ , $\pi_Bp_C=0$ , $\pi_Cp_B=0$ and $p_B\pi_B+p_C\pi_C=1_A$ . If we identify all the ""ones"" and the ""zeros"" as maps we end up exactly with the CK1 CK2 relations of the Leavitt Path Algebra of the graph with one vertex and two petals. In this case $\pi_B,\pi_C$ are the ghost edges respectively of $p_B,p_C$ . Hence in a certain sense, this decomposition of $A$ induces a Leavitt Path Algebra, in particular, the Leavitt algebra $L_{1,2}(\mathbb{K})$ . More in general, the direct sum of $k$ subgroups will induce the algebra $L_{1,k}(\mathbb{K})$ . I'm wondering if there is some sense behind this or if it is only a coincidence. Is there a similar construction for other types of decompositions of an abelian group? (A similar thing appears when we consider an extension of groups $0\rightarrow M\xrightarrow{i} E\xrightarrow{\pi} G\rightarrow 0$ . If we choose a section $s:G\rightarrow E$ we can naturally induce a map $\phi:E\rightarrow M$ such that $i,\pi,s,\phi$ verify similar relations as above).","['graph-theory', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"

Motivation: If $F:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$ is $C^\infty$ , and at $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ , $F_z\ne 0$ , then in a neighbourhood of $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ , $F(x,y,z)=F(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ gives a function $z=z(x,y)$ s.t. $F(x,y,z(x,y))=F(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ . We have $$z_{yx}=(z_x)_y\ \  \underbrace{=}_{?}\ \  \left(-\frac{F_x}{F_z}\right)_y=-\frac{F_{yx}F_z-F_xF_{yz}}{F_z^2}$$ ( Edit : The underbraced equality is incorrect, since $z_y=-\frac{F_y}{F_z}$ is not true for all $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}$ .) Symmetrically we have $$z_{xy}=-\frac{F_{xy}F_z-F_yF_{xz}}{F_z^2} $$ Since $F_{xy}=F_{yx}$ and $z_{yx}=z_{xy}$ we yield $$F_xF_{zy}=F_yF_{zx}. $$ However, the above argument assumes $F'z\ne 0$ , and it is very indirect.

4787480,"If a matrix contains a differential operator, can it have eigenvalues? If yes, how can I determine them?","If a matrix contains a differential operator, can it have eigenvalues? If yes, how can I determine them? I will assume that the answer is yes and try to solve the following problem. Consider the matrix $A$ defined as: $$ A = \begin{bmatrix}0 & {d \over dx} \\1 & 0
 \end{bmatrix} \tag 1$$ The eigenvectors can be found by solving a system of equations given by: $$ A\vec v - \lambda \vec v =0 \tag 2$$ where $\vec v$ is the eigenvector and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue. Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be components of $\vec v$ : $$ \vec v = \begin{bmatrix}f(x)  \\g(x) 
 \end{bmatrix} \tag 3 $$ Now equation $(2)$ becomes: $$ \begin{bmatrix}0 & {d \over dx} \\1 & 0
 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}f(x)  \\g(x) 
 \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \begin{bmatrix}f(x)  \\g(x)

However, I don't know how to actually determine the value of $\lambda$ (assuming that it actually exists). If $A$ was a linear operator, the eigenvalues would be calculated from its determinant. But now $A$ contains a differential operator. So my question is, how can the eigenvalues of $A$ be determined?","['systems-of-equations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'eigenfunctions']"
4787485,Evaluating $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n/2-1} \frac{k}{(n-k)^2} $,"I am trying produce a closed form for $\lim_{n\to\infty}S_n$ where: $$ S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n/2-1} \frac{k}{(n-k)^2} $$ For example, if $n = 10$ : $$S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \frac{k}{(10-k)^2}  = \frac{0}{10^2}+\frac{1}{9^2}+\frac{2}{8^2}+\frac{3}{7^2}+\frac{4}{6^2} = 0.2159 $$ If $n = 1000$ : $S_n = 0.3059$ If $n = 10000$ : $S_n = 0.3068$ Though simulation, as $n$ increases, this series converges to $\approx 0.3069$ . However, I would like to know how to calculate this value without resorting to plugging in large $n$ . Even an approximation of the summation as a function of $n$ would be fine. However, my knowledge of sum calculation is limited to geometric series and harmonic sequences. What I've tried: Series Analysis I tried to find some patterns in the sequence, and know that the first term is always $0$ , and the last term is always $\frac{n/2 -1}{(n/2 + 1)^2}$ , which approaches $0$ as $n$ increases, but I'm not sure how to generate a closed form solution for $S_n$ . I also thought of breaking the series up into two parts as shown: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n/2-1} k \cdot \frac{1}{(n-k)^2} $$ So there would be an arithmetic progression ( $S_{n+1} = S_{n} + 1 $ ), with each term multiplied by $1/{(n-k)}^2$ , but this still has lead me nowhere. I have noticed that if the series was: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n/2-1} \frac{n}{(n-k)^2} $$ ( $k$ in numerator replaced with $n$ ), the sum converges to $1$ . I did this because this series is strictly larger than the original, and I wanted to use the direct comparison test to formally prove convergence. Of course, I don't know how to prove that this series converges either, so this wasn't much help. Integration The last thing I tried was to plot the values of each term in the summation, and then plot them for different $n$ . If I could get an equation for these curves as a function of $n$ , I should be able to integrate them and get the summation value, right? The curves look to have the general form: $$ f(k) = y \cdot (e^{k\cdot x} - 1)  $$ where $x$ and $y$ are two real numbers. Does this idea hold merit? How could I find these curves analytically?

Another attempt is to use Markov inequality.

4787493,Convergence theorem for bounded continuous martingale in $L^2$,"I would like to be sure to understand the proof this theorem. Consider the set $\mathcal{M}^2$ of continuous martingale bounded in $L^2$ . If $(X_t)_{t\geq0}\in\mathcal{M}^2$ , there exists $X_{\infty}\in\mathcal{M}^2$ such that $(X_t)_{t\geq0}$ converges almost surely and in $L^2$ to $X_{\infty}$ . Moreover $\lVert X\rVert_{L^2} = \lVert X_{\infty}\rVert_{L^2}$ and for all $t\geq 0$ we have $\mathbb{E}(X_{\infty} | \mathcal{F}_t) = X_t$ Proof : Consider $X_t$ in $L_2$ a continuous martingale, to prove the convergence in $L^2$ norm it suffices to use the sequential characterization of the continuity (of the $L^2$ norm) and show that for all increasing sequence $t_n$ of positive numbers that goes to $\infty$ we have $X_{t_n}\to X_{\infty}$ . Consider such a sequence, since $X_{t_n}$ is a martingale and we are in $L^2$ we have for $m\geq n$ $$
\lVert X_{t_m} - X_{t_n}\rVert_{L^2}^{2} = \lVert X_{t_n}\rVert_{L^2}^{2} - \lVert X_{t_m}\rVert_{L^2}^{2}
$$ The $L^2$ norm of a martingale is increasing and here it is bounded, so as $n,Â m$ go to $\infty$ we have that $\lVert X_{t_m} - X_{t_n}\rVert_{L^2}^{2}\to 0$ . $L^2$ being complete and $X_{t_n}$ being a Cauchy sequence we conclude it has a limit $X_{\infty}$ . This limit is in $\mathcal{M}^2$ using the continuity of the $L^2$ norm. By continuity of the conditional expectation we also have $$
\mathbb{E}(X_{\infty} | \mathcal{F}) = \lim_{s\to\infty}\mathbb{E}(X_s | \mathcal{F}_t) = X_t
$$ Next we want to prove the almost sure convergence : from $X_{t_n}$ we can extract a subsequence $X_{\phi(t_n)}$ that converges almost surely to $X_{\infty}$ , we denote $A$ the set of probability $1$ on which we have this convergence. We would like to use that for all $\omega\in A$ we have $$
\lvert X_t - X_{\infty} \rvert\leq \lvert X_t - X_{\phi(t_n)} \rvert + \lvert X_{\phi(t_n)} - X_{\infty} \rvert
$$ However at the stage we have not upper bound for $\lvert X_t - X_{\phi(t_n)} \rvert$ . For this, we consider for all $n$ the martingale $Y_{n,s} = X_{\phi(t_n)+s} - X_{\phi(t_n)}$ . It is in $L^2$ so by Doobâ€™s inequality and the first result we prove earlier for convergence in $L^2$ of martingale in $L^2$ we have $$
\lVert \sup_{s\geq 0}\lvert Y_{n,s}\rvert\rVert_{L^2} \leq 2\lVert Y_n \rVert_{L^2}=2\lVert Y_{\infty}\rVert_{L^2} = 2\lVert X_{\infty} - X_{\phi(t_n)}\rVert_{L^2}\to 0
$$ When $t_n\to\infty$ . This proves that $ \sup_{s\geq 0}\lvert Y_{n,s}\rvert$ converges to $0$ in $L^2$ . By extracting a sub sequence $\left(Y_{\psi(n),s}= X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))+s} - X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))}\right)$ we get a convergence almost surely to $0$ , denote $B$ the set where take place such convergence. Now consider $C=B\cap A$ , we have $\mathbb{P}(C)=1$ . Hence, consider $\epsilon>0$ , $\exists N\left(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)$ such that $\psi(\phi(t_n))> N\left(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right) $ implies $$
\sup_{s\geq 0}\lvert Y_{\psi(n),s}\rvert + \lvert X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))} - X_{\infty} \rvert\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}
$$ Now take $t$ big enough such that $s = t-\psi(\phi(t_n))>0$ , then we have $$
\lvert X_t - X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))} \rvert = \lvert X_{\psi(\phi(t_n)) + s} - X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))} \rvert\leq \sup_{s\geq 0}\lvert Y_{\psi(n),s}\rvert
$$ Thus $$
\lvert X_t - X_{\infty}\rvert\leq \lvert X_t - X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))} \rvert + \lvert X_{\psi(\phi(t_n))} - X_{\infty} \rvert\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
$$ This holds for all $\omega\in C$ so we conclude for the convergence almost surely. Is this seems correct please ? I try to make clear every step in order to show my understanding of all notions that are used here, I would like to know if my understanding (and hence my proof) is correct please.

4787505,"How to prove that $f(x,y)=xy(x+y)$ isn't surjective as $f:\mathbb{Q}^2\to\mathbb{Q}$.","I would like to show that the rational polynomial function $f:\mathbb{Q}^2\to\mathbb{Q}$ defined as $f(x,y)=xy(x+y)$ isn't surjective. To do this, I tried proving that the algebraic plane curve $$K:xy(x+y)=1$$ has no rational points so that $1\not\in f[\mathbb{Q}^2]$ . I then considered the following elliptic curve $$E:v^2-v=u^3$$ which, according to the LMFDB , has the three rational points $E(\mathbb{Q})=\{\mathcal{O},(0,0),(0,1)\}\cong\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ . Now, the function $\psi:K(\mathbb{Q})\to E(\mathbb{Q})$ defined as $\psi(x,y)=\left(-
\frac{1
}{x+y},\frac{y}{x+y}\right)$ is well defined since $x+y$ isn't annihilated on $K$ and $$v^2-v=\left(\frac{y}{x+y}\right)^2-\frac{y}{x+y}=\frac{y^2-y(x+y)}{(x+y)^2}=-\frac{xy}{(x+y)^2}=-\frac{1}{(x+y)^3}=u^3$$ with $(u,v)=\psi(x,y)$ . But this means that $K$ has no rational points since $-\frac{1}{x+y}\neq0\Rightarrow \psi(x,y)\not\in E(\mathbb{Q}).\ \square$ However, this seems too much as it relies on theory of elliptic curves computing the Mordell-Weil group of $E$ . Maybe there's a non-constructive approach which proves that some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ isn't in the image of $f$ without specifying it. Or with elementary number theory employing, for example, modular arithmetic and power residues. So my question then is: Q: Is there an easier approach on proving that $f$ is not surjective?","['elliptic-curves', 'number-theory', 'alternative-proof', 'functions', 'polynomials']"
4787529,Dugundji: cofinite topology on countable infinite set is totally path-disconnected,"In James Dugundji's Topology (1966), chapter V, are the following problems: 1.3 Let $X$ be a[n infinite] countable set, with topology $\cal T = \{\emptyset\} \cup \{ A \space \vert \space {\complement}A$ is finite $\}$ . Show that $X$ is connected. 5.3 Let $X$ be the connected set in 1, Problem 3. Show that $X$ is totally pathwise disconnected. (By definition, $X$ is called totally pathwise disconnected if the only continuous maps $f: I \to X$ are the constant maps.) The first one is easy: in the cofinite topology, any two nonempty open sets meet, so there's no disconnection of $X$ . The second one was a challenge for me. A path in $X$ must be compact and connected, but all subsets of $X$ are compact and connected, so that doesn't help. Eventually I realized that a map $f: A \to X$ is continuous precisely when all fibers $f^{-1}(x)$ are closed. That led me to Proving a SierpiÅ„ski result on partitions of the unit interval into closed sets . So that's an answer, but it's hard for me to imagine many beginning topology students getting it. At this point in the text, we haven't even seen compactness, or identification maps, or separation axioms. Here's someone on Math Overflow who also found it not trivial: Why are the integers with the cofinite topology not path-connected? .

Is there any simpler approach to Problem V.5.3? I got interested in this question because of a resemblance to the pseudo-arc , which is another space with a homogeneous feel that's connected but totally path-disconnected. The pseudo-arc is Hausdorff, though, which makes it pretty different.

If the formula turns out to be recursive, is there some relatively ""simple"" heuristic that can estimate the expected number of rounds? There's also the tricky case of infinitely drawing blue balls after initially drawing some red balls, which would result in an infinite number of rounds. But my gut feeling says that the probability of this happening are small enough that the expected number of rounds should be finite. After searching a bit online, this seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong) the Coupon collector's problem but multiple coupons are drawn at once  instead of just one at a time, and that each of the coupons drawn are all distinct.  If that's the case, can any of the insights from that problem be used in the problem I have currently?","['expected-value', 'coupon-collector', 'balls-in-bins', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

Given a subset $X'$ of $X$ , there are two simple ways to measure how representative it is: $$r_0(X') := \min \left\{ r \geq 0 \mid \forall y \in Y \colon (1-r)\cdot f_X(y) \leq f_{X'}(y) \leq (1+r)\cdot f_X(y) \right\}  $$ $$r_1(X') := \min \left\{ r  \geq 0 \mid \forall y \in Y \colon f_X(y) - r \leq f_{X'}(y) \leq f_X(y) + r \right\}  $$ If $r_0(X') = r$ , this means the relative frequencies in $X'$ differ by at most $(100\cdot r)$ % from their counterparts in $X$ .

Using Abel's summation formula and Dirichlet's hyperbola method , I found that $$\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt n}=\frac{A(x)}{\sqrt x}+\frac{1}{2}\int_1^x\frac{A(t)}{t^{\frac{3}{2}}}dt$$ where $$A(x)=xL(1,\chi)-x\sum_{n> y}\frac{\chi(n)}{n}+O(y)+O\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\text{ for any }y>0$$ The optimal choice of $y$ for minimizing the terms $O(y),O(x/y)$ would seem to be $y=\sqrt x$ , but this yields $$A(x)=xL(1,\chi)-x\sum_{n> \sqrt x}\frac{\chi(n)}{n}+O(x^{1/2})$$ and the $O(x^{1/2})$ term, when integrated in $\frac{1}{2}\int_1^x\frac{A(t)}{t^{3/2}}dt$ , yields a $O(\log x)$ term and thus poses a problem for $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)/\sqrt{n}$ since all the terms that are not $2L(1,\chi)\sqrt{x}$ should be bounded. Am I missing something? Is there a better choice for $y$ ?","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'l-functions', 'dirichlet-character']"
4788367,Continuous extension of a function which retains the modulus of continuity,"Question Let $S \subset \mathbb R^d$ be compact and $f : S \to \mathbb R$ be continuous (hence uniformly continuous) on $S$ . A function $\omega : (0,\infty) \to (0,\infty)$ is called a modulus of continuity for $f$ if, for all $\epsilon>0$ , $$
\|x-y\| < \omega(\epsilon) \implies |f(x)-f(y)| < \epsilon, \text{for all } x,y \in S.
$$ In other words, $\delta = \omega(\epsilon)$ satisfies the $\epsilon-\delta$ of uniform continuity for $f$ . Furthermore, as illustrated by a counterexample in the comments, we insist that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \omega(\epsilon) =0$ . Suppose that $S \subset \mathbb R^d$ is compact and $f : S \to \mathbb R$ admits a modulus of continuity $\omega$ on $S$ . Does there exist a function $g : \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R$ such that (a) $g(x) = f(x)$ on $S$ , and (b) $g$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb R^d$ with modulus of continuity $\omega$ ? We can possibly relax the modulus of continuity of $g$ to be of the form $C \times \omega$ for any $C>0$ positive, but not more than that. Motivation In order to motivate this question, it helps to look at other extension theorems. Given $f : O \to \mathbb R$ uniformly continuous on an open set $O$ , it admits a unique extension to $\overline{O}$ which is also uniformly continuous. The proof technique is to define $\tilde{f}(x) = \lim_{y \to x, y \in O} f(y)$ and show that this works. Given any $f : S \to \mathbb R$ continuous where $S$ is closed, it admits a continuous extension to $\mathbb R^d$ . This follows directly from the Tietze extension theorem. If we assume that the modulus of continuity has a specific structure, then some results are known. See e.g. the Kirszbraun Theorem for Lipschitz moduli of continuity i.e. $\omega(\epsilon) = C\epsilon$ for some $C>0$ . Here's a nice proof of that result. What makes this particularly difficult to approach is the control of the modulus of continuity of $g$ outside the set $S$ . For example, suppose that we naively try to force $g$ to be constant outside an open set $O$ which contains $S$ , so that its modulus of continuity is controlled on $O^c$ . Certainly we can find a function $g$ such that $g \equiv f$ on $S$ and $g \equiv 0$ on $O$ , by a variation of Tietze's theorem. However, what we can't do using that scheme is control $|g(x)-g(y)|$ in the region between $S$ and $O$ . That's what makes this question interesting.","['uniform-continuity', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'general-topology']"

Rao-Blacwell teaches us how to find such an estimator, namely: $$\mathbb{E}\left[\left.X_1^3 \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)}\right|\sum X_i\right]$$ Let me compute the conditional density function: $$f_{X_1|\sum X_i=y}(x)= \frac{f_{X_1}(x)f_{\sum_{i>1} X_i}(y-x)}{f_{\sum X_i}(y)}=\frac{(\lambda^\alpha/\Gamma(\alpha))  e^{-\lambda x}x^{\alpha-1}(\lambda^{(n-1)\alpha}/\Gamma((n-1)\alpha))  e^{-\lambda (y-x)}(y-x)^{(n-1)\alpha-1}} {(\lambda^{n\alpha}/\Gamma(n\alpha))  e^{-\lambda y}y^{n\alpha-1}}$$ $$\therefore f_{X_1| \sum X_i=y}(x)=\frac{\Gamma(n \alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma((n-1)\alpha)}\frac{x^{\alpha-1}(y-x)^{(n-1)\alpha-1}}{y^{n\alpha-1}}$$ I believe, but I am not completely sure this enables us to write: $$ \mathbb{E}\left[\left.X_1^3 \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)}\right|\sum X_i\right]=\int_0^\infty x^3 \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)} f_{X_1| \sum X_i=y}(x)dx =$$ $$ \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)}\frac{\Gamma(n \alpha)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma((n-1)\alpha)}\int_0^y\frac{x^{\alpha+2}(y-x)^{(n-1)\alpha-1}}{y^{n\alpha-1}}dx=$$ $$\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)}\frac{\Gamma(n \alpha)}{\Gamma((n-1)\alpha)}\int_0^1\frac{{(y\tilde{x})}^{\alpha+2}(y-(y\tilde{x}))^{(n-1)\alpha-1}}{y^{n\alpha-1}}yd\tilde{x}=$$ $$\frac{(\sum X_i)^3}{\Gamma(\alpha+3)}\frac{\Gamma(n \alpha)}{\Gamma((n-1)\alpha)}\int_0^{1} \tilde{x}^{\alpha+2}(1-\tilde{x})^{(n-1)\alpha-1}d\tilde{x}$$ I am having trouble computing this integral and I am not really not sure if I am on the right track.","['statistics', 'conditional-expectation', 'umvue', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
4788719,"How to solve this absolute value equation: $|z-3|-|z+6|=0,z\in\mathbb C$","So I was bored, and decided to solve some absolute value equations. After a while, I came up with this $$|z-3|-|z+6|=0,z\in\mathbb C$$ which I thought that I might be able to solve. Here is my attempt at doing so: For any absolute value of a complex number, we have $$|a|\implies\sqrt{a^2}\\|a+bi|\implies\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\quad a,b\in\mathbb R\\\implies|a+bi+c|=\sqrt{a^2+2ac+c^2+b^2}\quad a,b,c\in\mathbb R$$ So we now have the equation $$\sqrt{a^2-6a+9+b^2}-\sqrt{a^2+12a+36+b^2}=0\\\implies a^2-a^2+b^2-b^2-6a-12a+9-36=0\\\implies-27-18a=0\implies18a+27=0\implies a=-\dfrac{27}{18}$$ Now to solve for $b$ . So we have $$\sqrt{\dfrac{729}{324}-\dfrac{162}{18}+9+b^2}=\sqrt{\dfrac{729}{324}+54+b^2}\\\implies\sqrt{\dfrac94+b^2}=\sqrt{\dfrac{225}4+b^2}\\\implies\dfrac94+b^2=\dfrac{225}4+b^2$$ meaning that for no $bi$ will make this statement true, meaning that our solution is $$z=-\dfrac{27}{18}+0i$$ which we can check in Desmos to confirm our answer. My question Is it true that the only solution to $$|z-3|-|z+6|=0,z\in\mathbb C$$ is $z=-\dfrac{27}{18}+0i$ , or what might I have done wrong?","['algebra-precalculus', 'absolute-value', 'complex-numbers']"
4788740,What are the chances that the Enemy/Defender game has a stable solution?,"There is a game called Enemy/Defender that you might play with kids. The setup is as follows: Everyone stands in a circle. You say, ""Look around the circle and select someone (at random) to be your enemy . Now pick a different person to be your defender . When I say 'Go!', you have to position yourself so that your defender is between you and your enemy... Go!"" The players will run around frantically until you stop the game. On rare occasions though, there is a stable configuration that occurs where everyone is standing in a line and doesn't need to move at all. The question is: For a game with n players with enemies and defenders chosen uniformly at random, what is the probability that a stable configuration exists? I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to solve this or even simulate it efficiently. Here's some basic insights: Even if there is a solution where everyone is not standing in a line, we can collapse it to a line without breaking the order, so we only need to consider permutations of the players as solutions. The game needs at least 3 players, but no solution exists for 3 players. This is easy to see because the middle player in any proposed solution must be adjacent to their enemy. For 4 or more players, there is a nonzero chance a solution exists. For any solution, the players at either end of the line cannot be anyone's defenders If everyone chooses the same defender, then a stable solution exists iff you can partition the remaining players into two sets such that everyone's enemy is in the opposite set (and the common defender's enemy and defender are in the same set). Some results from brute force simulation: 4 players :  8.3366% of 10000000 games 5 players : 12.2495% of 1000000 games 6 players : 16.6140% of 100000 games 7 players : 21.5500% of 10000 games 8 players : 28.1000% of 1000 games 9 players : 39.0000% of 100 games I would be very surprised if a succinct closed form solution exists, but even some insight on how to simulate it faster would be appreciated.","['order-theory', 'combinatorics', 'algorithms', 'recreational-mathematics', 'computer-science']"

The expected number of rolls is getting $234$ is solving for $x$ in the following equations: $$x = {5\over6}(x + 1) + {1\over6}(y + 1)$$ $$y = {2\over3}(x + 1) + {1\over6}(y + 1) + {1\over6}(z + 1)$$ $$z = {2\over3}(x + 1) + {1\over6}(y + 1) + {1\over6}$$ Solving, we get $x = 216$ , $y = 210$ , $z = 180$ , so the expected number of rolls it takes to get $234$ is also $216$ . So I have two questions: Given that the expected number of rolls for getting $556$ and $234$ is $216$ for both, does it follow that they're equally likely to show up first when rolling a $6$ -sided die? If not, which one is more likely to show up first? And what's the calculation that would demonstrate this?

My question is two-fold: Is it true that Euclidean distance in $\Bbb{R}^n$ must be defined and can't be derived once we define it in $\Bbb{R}^1$ and just apply Pythagoras theorem repeatedly (and the definition of $\Bbb{R}^n$ as the space spanned by orthogonal vectors)?

I would like to know if this works or if I'm getting lost in the objective to prove. I start by looking for the $\inf(A)$ . Clearly the infimum is $0$ due to the dominating exponent in the denominator. So by the definition, I need to show; $0$ is a lower bound for $A$ $\forall $ $ \epsilon>0$ , $0 + \epsilon$ is not a lower bound for A I begin with a rough proof to find the logic I need to follow for 1. So, show: \begin{align}
0 \leq \frac{n^3+1}{n^4+16} \\
0 \leq n^3+1\\
0 \leq n+1 \leq n^3+1\\
-1 \leq n
\end{align} Which then lets me start the actual proof: By the Archimedean property, $\exists$ $n \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $n \geq -1$ \begin{align}
n+1 \geq 0\\
n^3+1 \geq n+1 \geq 0\\
\frac{n^3+1}{n^3+16} \geq 0
\end{align} So $0$ is a lower bound for A Secondly, we need to show that $\epsilon + 0$ is not a lower bound for A. So, starting with a rough proof, I need to show that there exists some $n$ s.t \begin{align}
\frac{n^3+1}{n^4+16} \leq \epsilon\\
\frac{n^3+1}{n^4+16} \leq \frac{n^3}{n^4+16}+1 \leq \epsilon\\
\frac{n^3}{n^4+16} \leq \epsilon -1\\
\frac{n^3}{n^4+16} \leq \frac{n^3}{n^4} \leq \epsilon -1\\
\frac{1}{n} \leq \epsilon -1\\
n \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon -1}
\end{align} And with this, I worked backward to get the implication I needed (starting with the A.P as stated above). I won't write out my entire work for the supA, but it follows the same sort of method I used here. I want to make sure these step are coherent, and is there anything I can do to get to the desired values quicker as this is quite a tedious process to do explicitly. Thanks! Edit: In my supremum proof I've found an inequality I can't seem to manipulate. After proving 28/97 is an upper bound (through inspection of the sequence, n=3 yields the largest value). In the second step of showing that $\frac{28}{97} -\epsilon$ is not an upper bound, I begin like usual (showing that there exists an n s.t.): \begin{align}
\frac{n^3+1}{n^4+16} \geq \frac{28}{97} - \epsilon\\
\frac{n^3+1}{n^4+16} \geq \frac{n^3}{n^4+16} \geq \frac{28}{97} - \epsilon
\end{align} And I seem to be stuck. No matter the manipulation I can think of, I can't get myself to a form of $n \geq f(\epsilon)$ to use the Archimedean property. Any hints?","['solution-verification', 'supremum-and-infimum', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

After doing some research the argument seems to be correct for metric spaces with additional assumptions of one of the function being homeomorphism: If the composition of two functions is continuous and one of those functions is continuous, is the other function continuous as well? Note: superscripts in this proof are indexes not exponents. My test: I think if we let $X$ be path-connected, it is easy to prove that $g$ is continuous. Let $y_1<y_2$ be two real numbers and $h(x_i)=y_i$ , for any real number $y\in (y_1,y_2)$ , consider a sequence $y^n\in (y_1,y_2)$ converging to $y$ . We will show that $g$ is continuous at arbitrary real number $y$ . Let $T$ be the path between $x_1,x_2$ . It follows from the continuity of $h$ that for each $n$ there exists $x^n\in T$ such that $h(x^n)=y$ . Because of path-connectedness, path $T$ is compact. So sequence $x^n$ converges to $x$ where $f(x)=y$ . By the continuity of $f$ , it follows that $f(x^n)$ converges to $f(x)$ and $g(h(x^n))$ converges to $g(h(x))$ . Finally, we conclude that $h(x^n)\to h(x)$ $\implies g(h(x^n))\to g(h(x))$ . However, I think this method only works for path-connected $X$ not connected $X$ .

4788980,Triviality of the Euler totient of a non-cyclic Abelian group,"Recall that the Euler totient $\phi(n)$ satisfies the identity $$\phi(n) = \sum_{d|n} \frac{n}{d}\mu(d) = n\sum_{d|n}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}.$$ This computation can be interpreted as computing a certain invariant of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/n$ as follows. Given a finite group $G$ , let $\mu(G)$ be the Mobius function defined inductively by $\mu(1) = 1$ and for $G\neq 1$ $$\mu(G) = -\sum_{H<G} \mu(H).$$ Then we can define a generalized Euler totient $$\phi(G) := \sum_{H\leqslant G} [G:H]\mu(H) = |G|\sum_{H\leqslant G}\frac{\mu(H)}{|H|},$$ so that $\phi(\mathbb{Z}/n) = \phi(n)$ . This function came up while I was doing some computations in the incidence algebra of the lattice of subgroups of $G$ . I've seen a few papers that consider generalized Euler totients defined on finite groups, but they all seem to consider definitions that are not equivalent to the one given above. Which is actually pretty reasonable, since it turns out the above definition is trivial! Proposition. For any non-cyclic finite Abelian group $G$ , $\phi(G) = 0$ . It's not terribly difficult to prove this assertion. By multiplicativity it suffices to consider the case where $G$ is a non-cyclic $p$ -group. By standard properties of the Mobius function, $\mu(H) = 0$ unless $H$ is contained in the socle of $G$ . So it suffices to show the result for $G = (C_p)^n$ with $n>1$ . Using Hall's formula $$\mu((C_p)^n) = (-1)^n p^{\binom{n}{2}}$$ and basic counting we obtain the formula $$\phi((C_p)^n) = p^n \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}p^{\binom{k}{2}}p^{-k} \binom{n}{k}_p$$ where $\binom{n}{k}_p$ is the number of $k$ -dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ . Then applying the $q$ -binomial theorem we can simplify this expression to $$\phi((C_p)^n) = p^n\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1-p^{k-1})$$ which clearly vanishes if $n>1$ due to the $k=1$ term. Question: The computational proof outlined above doesn't really explain why the proposition is true, but presumably the result should be a reflection of some simple structural property of non-cyclic Abelian groups.

Let $V$ be a set of people and draw an edge between siblings ( $x$ and $y$ are siblings if $x\neq y$ and the set of parents of $x$ is equal to the set of parents of $y$ ). The handshaking lemma implies that the number of people in $V$ who have an odd number of siblings in $V$ is even. This was a bit underwhelming in class because the people in $V$ with an odd number of siblings, well, look at $x\in V$ and its set of neighbours $N(x)$ ... well $|\{x\}\cup N(x)|$ must be even and the thing falls out that way too... maybe I undersold this, I don't know.

4789132,James's theorem in incomplete normed spaces,"One version of James's theorem in functional analysis states the following. A Banach space is reflexive if, and only if, every bounded linear functional attains its norm on the unit sphere. For example if $X$ is a reflexive Banach space, then by Banach Alaoglu the unit sphere is weakly compact, so every bounded linear functional attains its supremum. If $X$ is irreflexive, then James's theorem states there exists a bounded linear functional that does not attain its norm on the unit sphere, which is significantly harder to show. My question is whether this theorem still holds when we drop the completeness requirement. So is a general normed space reflexive if, and only if, every bounded linear functional attains its norm on the unit sphere? Since incomplete spaces are never reflexive, the question is really whether every incomplete normed space admits a bounded linear functional that does not attain its norm on the unit sphere. My first thought is to look at the completion $\overline{X}$ of an incomplete normed space $X$ . If the completion is irreflexive then James's theorem already suffices, so we may assume $\overline{X}$ to be reflexive. Then for any vector $x$ on the unit sphere of $\overline{X}$ that is not in $X$ the Hahn Banach separation theorem gives a bounded linear functional $\phi$ which attains its norm at $x$ . If $\overline{X}$ is strictly convex, then $\phi$ can not attain its norm anywhere else, so it does not attain its norm on the unit sphere of $X$ . However I am lost at what to do if $\overline{X}$ is reflexive but not strictly convex. I have tried to use Krein Milman to ensure $x$ is an extreme point of the unit sphere, but then I can not ensure that $x$ is not in $X$ and it does not even really solve the strict convexity problem, because an extreme point can still be an endpoint of a line segment in the unit sphere. Side note: If $X$ is strictly convex, does it follow that $\overline{X}$ is also strictly convex?","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'reflexive-space']"

In order to achieve the residue 1, the number of indices i with $a_i\ge 4$ must differ by an even number from the number of indices $i$ with $a_i= 3$ .

Both triangles are right-angled and T has twice the area of U . What is the perimeter of T ? I can calculate what $b$ is, but cannot get any further. Any help would be appreciated. How I calculate $b$ : If we assume that $a$ is the shortest side of T , and that $b$ is the other side of the right-angle. Then $c$ must be the hypotenuse, and therefore longest side. Therefore, on U , $\dfrac{1}{c}$ must now be the shortest side, $\dfrac{1}{a}$ is the longest and $\dfrac{1}{b}$ is the ""middle"". Lets call A the opposite angle of $a$ and F the opposite of $\dfrac{1}{c}$ . Using sohcahtoa we can then deduce that $$\sin{A} = \dfrac{a}{c}$$ and $$\sin {F} = \frac{\dfrac{1}{c}}{\dfrac{1}{a}} = \frac{a}{c}$$ therefore the triangles are similar. Also because we are given that $$A(T) = 2\cdot A(U)$$ we know that $a=\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{2}$ and $b=\frac{1}{b}\sqrt{2}$ . the latter then allows us to calculate $b$ , which is is the 4th root of 2. Other worthy things to note: Using $$\text{Area of triangle} = \dfrac{1}{2} \:(\text{base} \times \text{height})$$ we get $$A(T)= \frac{1}{2}(ab)$$ and $$A(U) = \frac{1}{2bc}$$ therefore $$b^2 = \frac{2}{ac}$$ Also, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of $a/b$ must be the same as $(1/c) / (1/b)$ , thus $b^2 = ac$ .  Combining these gives $ac = 2 / ac$ .

It follows from $(*)$ and the induction that $|\vec x_n|\leq n|\vec x_1|$ for all $n\in\mathbb N_{\geq 1}$ , hence $\{\vec x_n/n\}_{n\geq 1}$ is a bounded sequence. On the other hand, $(*)$ also implies that $|\vec x_{n+m}|\le |\vec x_n|+|\vec x_m|$ for all $n,m\in\mathbb N_{\geq 1}$ , hence by Fekete's subadditive lemma we get the convergence of $\{|\vec x_n|/n\}_{n\geq 1}$ with $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|\vec x_n|}n=\inf_{n\geq 1}\frac{|\vec x_n|}n.$$ If $d=1$ , then the answer is yes , which is proved in this post . For $d\geq2$ , I tried to use the same ideas as in that post. If $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{|\vec x_n|}n=L$ , then for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N\gg L$ such that $\left|\frac{|\vec x_n|}n-L\right|<\varepsilon$ for all $n>N$ . Take $\varepsilon>0$ small enough. Fix $n_0>N$ , then there exists $\vec z_1$ with $|\vec z_1|=1$ such that $\left|\frac{\vec x_{n_0}}{n_0}-L\vec z_1\right|<\varepsilon$ . Let $n$ be the largest integer such that $\left|\frac{\vec x_{k}}{k}-L\vec z_1\right|<\varepsilon$ holds for all $n_0\leq k\leq n$ . Then $\left|\frac{\vec x_{n}}{n}-L\vec z_1\right|<\varepsilon$ and $\left|\frac{\vec x_{n+1}}{n+1}-L\vec z_1\right|\geq\varepsilon$ , hence $\left|\frac{\vec x_{n+1}}{n+1}-L\vec z_2\right|\geq\varepsilon$ for some $\vec z_2$ with $|\vec z_2|=1$ and $\vec z_2$ is far away from $\vec z_1$ . However, they are not as far away as in that post, where $\vec z_1=1, \vec z_2=-1$ for $d=1$ . I'm not sure how to continue. In fact, I suspect that the answer for $d\geq 2$ is negative. But I cannot find a counterexpamle.","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
4789716,Integral Representation of $\zeta^2(3)$ based on $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln^ms\cdot\ln^n(1+s)}{1+s}ds$,"Using Integer Relation Algorithms, I was able to arrive at the following : $$12\zeta^2(3)=-40\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln s\ln^{4}(1+s)}{1+s}ds+40\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln^{2}s\ln^{3}(1+s)}{1+s}ds-44\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln^{3}s\ln^{2}(1+s)}{1+s}ds+23\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln^{4}s\ln(1+s)}{1+s}ds$$ Is it possible to simplify the Right Hand Side so that we have a nice Integral Representation for $\zeta^2(3)?$ Maybe we can apply some Powerful Substitution. The Coefficients do have Alternating Signs. I thought to make a pattern appear by removing the powers of $2$ as : $$5\cdot2^3,\ 10\cdot2^2,\ 22\cdot2^1,\ 23\cdot2^0$$ But this does not appear to be binomial. Also, I do not expect it to be feasible considering the Coefficients do not exhibit any Binomial Pattern.","['integration', 'calculus', 'definite-integrals']"
4789717,Precise statement of PoincarÃ© duality,"Let $(M,g)$ be a (not-necessarily compact) oriented, connected Riemannian manifold. Lets consider the pairing $$\Omega^{k}(M)\times\Omega^{d-k}_{c}(M)\to\mathbb{R}, (\alpha,\beta)\mapsto\int_{M}\alpha\wedge\beta$$ It is well-known that this pairing induces a well-defined pairing on cohomology $$H^{k}(M)\times H^{d-k}_{c}(M)\to\mathbb{R}, ([\alpha],[\beta])\mapsto\int_{M}\alpha\wedge\beta\quad\quad\quad (\ast)$$ PoincarÃ© duality states that this pairing is non-degenerate (in both entries I suppose (?)). Now, my question is, what are the precise assumption for this to hold? In the book Manifolds and Differential Geometry by J. M. Lee, only non-degenaracy in the first entry is proven, i.e. that ( $\ast$ ) viewed as a map $H^{k}(M)\to (H^{d-k}_{c}(M))^{\ast}$ is an isomorphism provided $(M,g)$ admits a finite good cover . On the other hand, in Connections, Curvature, and Cohomology 1 by W. Grueb, it is mentioned that the finite good cover assumption is actually only needed for the other side, i.e. to show that ( $\ast$ ) viewed as a map $H^{d-k}_{c}(M)\to (H^{k}(M))^{\ast}$ is an isomorphism... Does anyone know the precise statement or has some idea where to find it?","['riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request', 'duality-theorems', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

\phi_m (\sigma) = \int_0^\infty \frac{u}{u^2+\sigma^2} \, J_{4m} (u) \, \mathrm{d} u \, , 
$$ wherein $\sigma \ge 0$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$ .
The first four terms can be obtained as \begin{align}

\end{align} It appears that the overall expression will begin with the first term, denoted as $K_{4m}(\sigma)$ , accompanied by a generalized hypergeometric function for which I have yet to discover a general expression.

P.S: $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)=(C_c^{\infty}(\Omega),\tau_{LF})$ , i.e., $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ endowed with its canonical LF topology. $W^{k,p}_0(\Omega)=\big(\mathcal{D}(\Omega), \|\cdot\|_{W^{k,p}({\Omega})}\big)$ , i.e., $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ endowed with the topology generated by $W^{k,p}{\Omega}$ norm.

However, for an ellipse not meeting these conditions, like the example mentioned here , the task becomes more challenging but remains achievable through algebraic manipulation. I attempted to apply a similar approach to the equation $AX^2 + BY^2 + CZ^2 + DXY + EXZ + FYZ - R_{0}^2= 0$ representing an ellipsoid, but I have not been able to solve it.

4789874,Single line coupled 2nd order differential equation,"In the paper 2111.05151 that I'm reading, there is a single coupled second-order differential equation (equation 71 in the paper), \begin{equation}
r \ddot{z}_1 = z_1 \ddot{r}, \qquad z_1(v_0) = z_1(v_f) = 0
\end{equation} where the dot is derivative with respect to $v$ , and $v_0$ & $v_f$ are the initial and final points respectively. The paper wrote that the solution that satisfies the above equation including the boundary condition on $z_1$ is given by, \begin{equation}
z_1 = c r
\end{equation} for some constant $c$ . Typically, we would need two equations in order to solve for $z_1$ and $r$ as a function of $v$ . However, in this case, I just need to get $z_1$ as an expression in terms of $r$ as is done in the paper. How is the solution obtained? I'm applying the method in the paper to a situation that I'm studying for which I got a single coupled second-order differential equation given by, \begin{equation}
2 r \ddot{z}_1 + 4 \dot{r} \dot{z_1} + 3 \ddot{r} z_1 = 0, \qquad z_1(v_0) = z_1(v_f) = 0
\end{equation} Again, how do you solve for $z_1$ in terms of $r$ ? EDIT: I'm not sure if rewriting the expression in the same way as @user10354138 will be helpful, \begin{equation}
2 r \ddot{z}_1 + 4 \dot{r} \dot{z_1} + 3 \ddot{r} z_1 = 0\\
2 r \ddot{z}_1 + 2 \dot{r} \dot{z_1} + 2 \dot{r} \dot{z_1} + 2 \ddot{r} z_1 + \ddot{r} z_1 = 0\\
2\left( \frac{d}{dv}(r \dot{z}_1) + \frac{d}{dv}(\dot{r} z_1) \right) + \ddot{r} z_1 = 0\\
\frac{d}{dv} \left( r \dot{z}_1 + \dot{r} z_1 \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \ddot{r} z_1
\end{equation} Of course, we could rewrite the LHS and RHS further, but this is one version.","['calculus', 'systems-of-equations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
