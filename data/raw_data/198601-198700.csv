3847944,"How to calculate $\lim_{(x, y) \to (0,0)} \frac{xy^2}{x^2 - y^2}$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : What paths to choose to prove that $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}\frac{xy^2}{x^2 - y^2}$ does not exist? (5 answers) Closed 3 years ago . How do I show that $\lim_{(x, y) \to (0,0)}\frac{xy^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 0$ ? I tried using polar coordinates, and arrived at $\lim_{r \to 0^+}r \tan{(2\theta)} \sin \theta$ . But then, I couldn't find a nice way to prove that this is zero, because the function multplying $r$ isn't bounded. Does anyone have a nice, simple solution?","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus']"
3848003,Pigeonhole Principle Problem - Circle,"I'm working on a homework problem with the following instruction: Suppose there is a class of 2 n students with different names sat in a large show and tell circle. The teacher returns their homework, but each student in the circle is given another student's homework. Therefore, the class agrees to pass the homework to the student sitting to their right. Once again, the names are all wrong. For the first n times they do this, they all have the wrong named homework. So in all there are n + 1 configurations in which every student is matched with someone else's homework). Show that if they continue passing the homeworks to their right, they will eventually reach a configuration where 3 students have the homework with their own names. I've done a few problems with the pigeonhole principle, but this one is giving me exceptionally more trouble. I've illustrated two separate cases, both where n = 2 , which both result in a class size of 4. The uppercase letters are the children and the lowercase letters are the corresponding homeworks. Test with class of 4 With the above starting configuration, I could not get it to be where three students concurrently have the correct homework, only two at once. I also didn't break any of the apparent contraints: Each student does not recieve their homework initally Each student does not have their homework after 1 round of passing The second case in the drawings is to exemplify what would happen if the student to one's left had their homework, i.e. necessitating only one pass. However, I'm fairly certain the question says this is not allowed since Therefore, the class agrees to pass the homework to the student sitting to their right. Once again, the names are all wrong. Meaning that the round after the first pass must also ensure no one has their homework. I trust the question is correct in what it is proposing, but I am having trouble understanding it and applying the Pigeonhole principle. Are the ""holes"" the kids and the ""pigeons"" he homework and if so, how would one calculate in the case where it's not as simple as a pigeon in the hole, but the correct pigeon in the correct hole? Any help would be appreciated.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

My question is this: is there any generalization for this? If so, what's the proof of that? more specifically, is there any rule for when $(ab)^p=a^p b^p$ and $(ab)^q= a^q b^q$ with a certain relation between $p$ and $q$ (possibly relating to their gcd) we can say $G$ is abelian?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

3848128,MAGMA-question concerning the transformation of a $kG$-module $M$ into a right ideal of the group algebra,"Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ be a finite field of characteristic $p>0$ such that $p\mid |G|$ . Let $M$ be a $kG$ -module which has an embedding $M\hookrightarrow kG^{reg}$ into the regular $kG$ -module $kG^{reg}$ . Then $M$ corresponds to a right ideal of $kG$ . Question: Is there a MAGMA command / procedure that has as input the $kG$ -module $M$ and as output the corresponding right ideal $I$ in terms of giving me elements of the algebra $kG$ that generate $M$ as the right ideal $I$ ? I only could find how to get a basis of the module $M$ in the manual, but not how to transform this into the elements of the algebra $kG$ . I would be very grateful for any help. Thanks in advance. EDIT (04.10.2020) : I am in the following concrete situation: Let $P$ be a non-trivial $p$ -subgroup of $G$ . Let $T$ be the trivial group. Consider the $kP$ -module $M:= k \uparrow_T^{P}\cong {kP}^{\text{reg}}$ . $M$ is a permutation module. Hence, $k_P$ is a submodule of $M$ (namely, $\{\lambda\cdot (1,1,1,\dots , 1)^t | \lambda\in k\} \cong k$ , if $M$ is given as a representation via permutation matrices). Since $kG$ is free as $kP$ -module, the induction functor is exact. Thus, via induction, we get the $kG$ -module $N:=k\uparrow_P^G$ as a submodule of $M\uparrow_P^G\cong {kG}^{\text{reg}}$ . I would like to get $N$ (and all of its direct summands) as a right ideal of $kG$ and couldn't find out how to do this in MAGMA.

3848268,"Player rolls dice: for every “1” he gets 1 point, “11” - 5 points, “111” - 10 pts, so on. What is the mean score after 100 rolls?","For $x \neq 1$ : every $“\cdots x1x\cdots“$ gives +1 pt every $“\cdots x11x\cdots“$ gives +5 pts. every $“\cdots x111x\cdots“$ gives +10 pts. And so on: $n$ consecutive 1’s gives us $(n-1)5$ points. To make it clear, the usual 6-sided dice is rolled 100 times, so for example if player rolls dice 1 time - there’s 1/6 chance of getting 1 point; rolls two times - then there’s $\frac{1}{6}\frac{5}{6}2$ chance of 1 point(“1x” or “x1”) and $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2$ of getting 5 points(only if “11” rolled out). The question: what is the mean score after rolling dice 100 times? The problem is: how do we calculate the mean when the number of rolls is so huge? It’s clear that using definition of the mean directly is not an option because number of different configurations for getting any score is immense(only if that score is not, say, 99*5 which require all the 1’s). I tried to use induction, but it didn’t worked out, for 3-4 rolls it already gets complicated. Moreover, how am I suppose to use it? If I know mean for &n& rolls and then I add $(n+1)$ th roll - it will add 0, 1 or 5 points depending on which number rolled in $n$ th place. Seems like knowing mean for $n$ rolls won’t be much of a help because after one more roll chance of getting any score is different. Another idea given to me by roommate is to fix number of ones that we get in entire 100-length sequence(so probability is fixed as well), and see what number of points we can possibly get with that number of 1’s - to know that these numbers will appear in formula for mean with known probability factor. But I’m not sure about that also because the amount of combinations is still insane. I ran out of ideas for now. Feels like there must be some efficient, less bloody way to calculate all that because our teacher gave us only 40 minutes for that problem (and another one), which completely freaked me out. All I wanted to say - I really appreciate any of your help since I absolutely have to figure this out. One more question: could anyone recommend some book with hard combinatorial problems in probability? Or some good textbook which could explain how to solve problems of that kind. That would be very helpful as well, thank you.","['book-recommendation', 'reference-request', 'expected-value', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

3848300,"Seven vertices of a cube are labeled 0, and the remaining vertex labeled 1. Can you make all labels divisible by 3?","Seven vertices of a cube are labeled 0, and the remaining vertex labeled 1. You’re allowed to change the labels by picking an edge of the cube, and adding 1 to the labels of both of its endpoints. After repeating this multiple times, can you make all labels divisible by 3? It's from an invariant handout. I am not even able to get the main idea and haven't been able to proceed too. So first I named the vertices $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$ and let $a$ be the vertex having label $1$ and others $0$ . Define $f(i) =$ the no labeled in the vertex $i$ Now, after pairing non adjacent vertices , let us say $(a,c,f,h)$ and $(b,d,e,g)$ , we get that if $a$ will be divisible by $3$ , it will be due to $3$ other vertices let's say $(b, d, e)$ , and we will have $3k+1=f(a)$ . But $f(b),f(d),f(e)$ are divisible by $3$ . So these vertices must have $2 \mod 3$ to other $2$ vertices   . But what should I do next ? Thanks in advance!

3848330,Real-Valued Measurable Cardinals and Powerset Algebras,"I realized the only example of a nonmeasurable set I had seen (a vitali set) crucially relies on the translation invariance of the lebesgue measure. I looked around for other examples of nonmeasurable sets, and struggled to find any. This led me to ask if there are measures which can be defined on the entire powerset algebra. A moment's thought shows the dirac measure works, and indeed you can take the measure $\sum_{r_i \in \mathbb{Q}} 2^{-i} \delta_{r_i}$ to make this example slightly less trivial... But what about nonatomic measures? I'm casually acquainted with set theory, and I thought this might depend on your choice of foundations. So I asked a set theorist friend of mine, and he pointed me towards ""real-valued measurable cardinals"". The wikipedia page says ""A real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to $\mathfrak{c}$ exists if and only if there is a countably additive extension of the lebesgue measure to all sets of real numbers if and only if there is an atomless probability measure on the power set of some nonempty set"" Where can I find a reference for this equivalence? Or, if it isn't hard, can someone post a proof here? I am comfortable with Set Theory at the level of Kunen's ""easy consistency proofs"".

3848542,What is the natural motivation for smooth/étale/unramified morphisms restricting from formally smooth/étale/unramified morphisms?,"Also at MO . Smooth (resp. étale) morphisms are just locally finitely presented + formally smooth (resp. étale) morphisms.
For unramified morphisms, it is originally defined in EGA as locally finitely presented + formally unramified morphisms, but now they are widely accepted as locally of finite type + formally unramified morphisms. My question is, why do we need to add the ""locally finitely presented"" or ""locally of finite type"" conditions in the ""true definition"" of smooth/étale/unramified morphisms? According to vakil's discussion and this note about motivations of unramified morphisms , we can see that the three morphisms are analogues of some important notions in differential geometry: Smooth-Submersions: surjections on tangent space, e.g. $\mathbb{A}^9\to \mathbb{A}^5$ Étale-Covering Spaces: bijections on tangent space, e.g. $\mathbb{A}^5\to \mathbb{A}^5$ Unramified-Immersions: injections on tangent space, e.g. $\mathbb{A}^2\to \mathbb{A}^5$ From my point of view, given a morphism of schemes $f:X\to Y$ , the natural analogue of surjection (resp. bijection, resp. injection) on tangent spaces is perfectly described by surjection (resp. bijection, resp. injection) of $$\DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec}\DeclareMathOperator{\Hom}{Hom}\Hom_Y(\Spec A,X)\to \Hom_Y(\Spec A/I,X)$$ where $\Spec A$ is any afine $Y$ -scheme with $I^2=0$ . In the language of this note about motivations of unramified morphisms , they are all the ""differential like data"", and tangent vectors can be thought as differentals. So I would be happy to accept the above definitions as the defitions of smooth (resp. étale, unramified) morphisms. Is there any natural motivations that we include these finiteness conditions? The idea ""we need the fibres of smooth morphisms to be smooth varieties"" is not enough to convince me, because there are still the case étale morphisms and unramified morphisms, also why do we need that naturally? e.g. Is there any morphisms of schemes that are not expected to be smooth/étale/unramified intuitively but they fall into the cateogy of formally smooth/étale/unramified? So to exclude them we need to introduce finiteness condition. Is there any big theorems that have to include finiteness conditions?

My approach was the following. We can write $$(1+x+x^2+...+x^n)^d=c_0+c_1z+c_2z^2+...+c_{n\cdot d}z^{n\cdot d}.$$ The $n$ th derivative of this will have the form $$c'_n+c'_{n+1}z^{n+1}+...+c'_{n\cdot d}z^{n\cdot d},$$ so evaluating at $z=0$ is the same as computing $c'_n$ , which $$c'_n=c_n\cdot n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot2=c_n\cdot n!.$$ Using the multinomial theorem we have $$(1+x+x^2+...+x^n)^d=\sum_{k_0+k_1+...+k_n=d}{d \choose k_0,k_1,...,k_n}\prod_{t=0}^nz^{t\cdot k_t}.$$ Now $$\prod_{t=0}^nz^{t\cdot k_t} = z^{\sum_{t=0}^nt\cdot k_t},$$ so we need $k_t$ such that $\sum_{t=0}^nt\cdot k_t=n$ , or $\sum_{t=1}^nt\cdot k_t=n$ and $k_0=d-(k_1+...+k_n)$ . Then, $c_n$ will be the the multinomial coefficient where $$k_1+2k_2+3k_3+...+nk_n=n.$$ I am stuck here, since there are many combinations of $k_t$ that satisfy the previous equality.

3848657,How to extend the Radon transform to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$?,"The (2D) Radon transform $R$ is usually defined for functions in the Schwartz space $S(\mathbb{R}^2)$ or bump functions $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$ by \begin{align*}
R\colon C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)&\to L^2(\mathbb{R}\times[0,\pi))\newline
(Rf)(r,\varphi)&:=\int_{L(r,\varphi)}f(x) dx
\end{align*} where $L(r,\varphi)$ is the line in the plane parameterized by the angle $\varphi$ and the directed distance from the origin $r$ . This definition ensures that the integral exists. It is easy to show (by estimating the operator norm) that the Radon transform is continuous when it is (for example) restricted to $C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ , where $\Omega$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Because $C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ is dense in $L^2(\Omega)$ , the Radon transform then has a unique continuous extension to $L^2(\Omega)$ . In the literature however, I often see references to the Radon transform defined on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ . But I do not understand how the Radon transform can be extended from the bump functions to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ since the proof for continuity only works for bounded sets.

3848681,What is the distributive reflection of the lattice of ideals of a ring?,"Let $A$ be a commutative ring and let $L$ be the set of ideals of $A$ , partially ordered by inclusion. $L$ is a complete lattice but is not distributive in general. For instance, in the polynomial ring $k [x, y]$ : $$((x) + (y)) \cap (x + y) = (x + y)$$ $$((x) \cap (x + y)) + ((y) \cap (x + y)) = (x (x + y), y (x + y))$$ On the other hand, sometimes $L$ is distributive – for instance, if $A$ is a principal ideal domain. By general nonsense, there is a frame (= complete lattice in which binary meets distribute over arbitrary joins) $F$ and a ""frame"" homomorphism (= monotone map preserving finite meets and arbitrary joins) $L \to F$ such that every ""frame"" homomorphism from $L$ to a frame factors through $L \to F$ in a unique way. This is called the frame reflection of $L$ . Question. Is there a ""nice"" description of the frame reflection of $L$ ? Again, by general nonsense, the ""frame"" homomorphism $L \to F$ is surjective and admits a right adjoint $F \to L$ , which means we can think of $F$ as a certain subset of $L$ that is closed under arbitrary meets. In other words, $F$ is isomorphic to the poset of ideals of $A$ satisfying a certain condition – is there a ""nice"" description of that condition? There is a well known frame of ideals associated with $A$ , namely the frame of radical ideals of $A$ , better known in its incarnation as the poset of open subsets of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ . In general, $F$ is ""larger"" than the frame of radical ideals: for instance, if $A = \mathbb{Z}$ . So $F$ corresponds to some kind of generalisation of radical ideal. It may be worth pointing out that $A \mapsto F$ is probably not functorial. The obvious functor $A \mapsto L$ sends ring homomorphisms to monotone maps that preserve arbitrary joins, but binary meets may not be preserved.

3848706,Integration on manifolds vs. integration on chains,"Motivation/Background: I wish to understand the more practical/computable aspects of integration of differential forms on manifolds. In this question I shall usually implicitly include ""manifolds with boundary"" and ""manifolds with corners"" into the term ""manifold"". Most textbooks on differential geometry introduce two related but a priori seemingly distinct theories of integration, integration on manifolds (with boundary/corners) , and integration on chains . The exact relationship between the two is unclear to me. Usually integration on manifolds is defined by assuming that the differential form has compact support (to avoid convergence issues), but on manifolds with boundary/corners this does mean that the support can intersect the boundary. The integral is defined in terms of coordinates, and is globalized by using a locally finite cover by coordinate neighborhoods and a partition of unity subordinate to this cover. In practice, this does not provide a method amenable to calculations because constructing partitions of unity explicitly can be difficult/impossible. By contrast, the integration on chains goes as follows. I will use cubic chains in this question as opposed to simplicical chains, as I find it is easier to do calculations with cubes. As far as I am aware, the two theories are equivalent. An elementary $r$ -cube is defined to be $I^r\subset\mathbb R^r$ , where $I=[0,1]$ . As a subspace of $\mathbb R^r$ , the elementary $r$ -cube is a manifold with corners. An $r$ -cube in an ( $n$ dimensional) manifold $M$ is defined to be a smooth map $\sigma:I^r\rightarrow M$ . This map does not need to be an immersion or injective or anything, it might be quite degenerate. An $r$ -chain $C$ on $M$ is defined to be a formal finite linear combination of $r$ -cubes: $$ C=\sum_i \alpha_i\sigma_i.$$ If $\omega\in \Omega^r(M)$ is a (smooth) $r$ -form, the integral of $\omega$ over an $r$ -cube $\sigma$ is defined as $$ \int_\sigma\omega=\int_{I^r}\sigma^\ast\omega, $$ where in the last integral the standard orientation of $\mathbb R^r$ is used. In other words, we may write $\sigma^\ast\omega=\rho(u^1,...,u^r)\mathrm du^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm du^r$ , where $u^1,...,u^r$ are the standard coordinates on $\mathbb R^r$ , and the integral is $$ \int_\sigma\omega=\int_0^1...\int_0^1\rho(u^1,...,u^r)\mathrm du^1...\mathrm du^r. $$ For a general $r$ -chain $C=\sum_i\alpha_i\sigma_i$ , we have $$ \int_C\omega=\sum_i\alpha_i\int_{\sigma_i}\omega. $$ For the elementary $r$ -cube $I^r$ , the $i$ th positive boundary is defined as $$ \partial_i^+I^r=\{u\in I^r:\  u^i=1 \}, $$ while the $i$ th negative boundary is defined as $$ \partial_i^- I^r=\{ u\in I^r:\ u^i=0\}, $$ and the boundary of $I^r$ is $$ \partial I^r=\sum_{i=1}^r\partial_i^+ I^r-\sum_{i=1}^r\partial_i^- I^r. $$ If $\sigma:I^r\rightarrow M$ is a general $r$ -cube, then $$ \partial_i^+\sigma=\sigma|_{\partial_i^+ I^r},\quad\partial_i^-\sigma=\sigma|_{\partial^-_i I^r} $$ and $$ \partial\sigma=\sum_{i=1}^r\partial_i^+\sigma -\sum_{i=1}^r\partial^-_i\sigma. $$ The boundary of a general $r$ -chain is defined by linearity. When one integrates over curves, since every 1 dimensional manifold is diffeomorphic to either $\mathbb R$ , $S^1$ , or a closed interval, one may always effectively parametrize the curve using a single coordinate system, which might be degenerate at a single point (in case of $S^1$ ), which is of measure zero, so this degeneracy does not affect the integral. It seems to me that chains realize this ideal for higher dimensional manifolds, since integration over a chain is always a linear combination of integrals over a cube, which is calculatable in principle (I mean this in the sense that the parametrization itself is not a part of the problem  - the integrals of course might be impossible to explicitly compute), and when we integrate over surfaces in physics and vector calculus, we usually actually integrate on chains, rather than manifolds. To give an explicit example, a sphere of radius $r_0$ in $\mathbb R^3$ is a submanifold, which cannot be described using a single chart. However if we consider the map $$ \sigma:I^2\rightarrow \mathbb R^3,\ \sigma(u^1,u^2)=\left(\begin{matrix} r_0\sin(\pi u^1)\cos(2\pi u^2) \\ r_0\sin(\pi u^1)\sin(2\pi u^2) \\ r_0\cos(\pi u^1)\end{matrix}\right), $$ this map fails to be an immersion at $u^1=0$ and $u^1=1$ , but it does cover the entire sphere as point sets. The set of points where this map fails to be an immersion is a set of zero measure, thus the entire sphere can be described for the purposes of integration using a single $2$ -cube. Moreover, this also describes the boundary, since the $u^1=1$ and $u^1=0$ boundaries are single points, so they are sets of measure zero as $1$ -manifolds, and the $u^2=1$ and $u^2=0$ boundaries are the same line segments but with the opposite orientation, so $1$ -integrals over these $1$ -cubes cancel. Hence, the boundary of the sphere is zero even from the chain point of view. Questions: For the practical parametrization of submanifolds and the explicit computability of integrals, it would be very beneficial if the situation outlined with the sphere embedded in $\mathbb R^3$ would be general. In other words, a theorem of the following form should exist: Hopefully existing theorem: Given an $r$ dimensional ""submanifold with boundary/corners"" $S$ in $M$ , there is an $r$ -chain $C$ in $M$ that is ""equivalent"" to $S\ \blacksquare$ . I have put ""submanifold"" into quotes because there are multiple inequivalent possible definitions (injective immersion, embedding etc.) and I do not know which one should be used, and I have put ""equivalent"" into quotes because I do not know what definition should such an equivalence satisfy. I would assume that as point sets the image of $S$ and $C$ should agree and it should be true that for any $\omega\in\Omega^r(M)$ $r$ -form we should have $$ \int_S\omega=\int_C\omega, $$ where the first expression is integration of $\omega$ in the sense of manifolds and the second expression is integration of $\omega$ in the sense of chains. The manifolds in question are orientable and oriented whenever necessary. So... Does such a result exist? In other words, given a submanifold, is it always possible to replace the submanifold with a chain for the purposes of integration? I would be terribly appreciative if references (papers and/or textbooks) would be given to me where such results are treated/proven. If the answer to 1) is affirmative, then the proofs/treatment of that result, and if the answer to 1) is negative, then for example sources that treat/explain when exactly can integration over manifolds be replaced with integration over chains.","['integration', 'vector-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

I wonder: Does $\det(\nabla X)$ has a geometric interpretation as well? I am particularly interested to know if there is any interpretation for $\nabla X$ being orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing (which corresponds to $\det(\nabla X)$ being everywhere positive or everywhere negative). Thus, even if there is no clear (quantitative) interpretation for the exact function $\det(\nabla X)$ , I would like to know if there is any interpretation for it having a definite sign . Note that $\nabla X:TM \to TM$ is (fiberwise) a self-map of a vector space, so its determinant is well-defined, even without any choice of orientation on $M$ .

But not sure if this is the right way to proceed if $y\neq n$ and have no clue what to do next. Does anybody have any ideas? I also established the following recurrence relation (which should not be confused with the standard recurrence for a determinant of a continuant): $$
f_n(x,y)=(x+n-1)f_{n-1}(x-1,y-1)+(1-n)(y-n)f_{n-2}(x-1,y-1).
$$ Again, one can see that it can be easily solved when $y=n$ . But what to do when $y\neq n$ is not clear. EDIT: It turns out that when treated as a polynomial in $x$ , the the system of functions $f_n(x,y)$ form an orthogonal polynomial system. I found that then $f_n(x,y)$ is related to Meixner polynomials (from Chihara's book on orthogonal polynomials) with $f=d=0$ and $g$ and $h$ suitably chosen. But Muir's book was written in 19-th century, well before the Meixner polynomials were discovered by Meixner in 1934. So this problem in Muir's book is really confusing. Addendum. The problem exactly how it looks in the 1960 edition of the book: It is equivalent to the formulation I gave above after a simple eqiuivalence transformation and change of notation.","['matrices', 'determinant', 'linear-algebra', 'tridiagonal-matrices']"

3849429,Concrete example of non-abelian class field theory - why Langlands program *is* a non-abelian class field theory?,"Abelian class field theory generalizes quadratic reciprocity laws for general number fields with abelian Galois groups, which connects class groups and Galois groups via Artin's reciprocity map. Also, quadratic reciprocity gives us some explicit examples of simple criterions to determine whether a rational prime $p$ splits or inerts in a given quadratic field. (For example, $p$ splits in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ if $p$ is a form of $4k +1$ .) I also heard from a lot of people that Langlands program can be thought as a non-abelian version of class field theory, and the abelian class field theory is just 1-dimensional Langlands program (Langlands over $\mathrm{GL}_1$ , see here for details). Also, Langlands over $\mathrm{GL}_2$ is about theory of modular forms (and of course Maass forms), Elliptic curves, 2-dimensional Galois representations, etc. However, I could not find an actual example that Langlands program is the non-abelian class field theory in the way of giving a criterions for splitting primes in a number field with non-abelian Galois groups. For example, a splitting field of a random cubic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ (let's say, $f(x) = x^3 -x  -1$ ) might give a field with Galois group $S_3$ (if its discriminant is not a square). and it seems very hard to describe the splitting behavior of a rational prime $p$ in that field. What I (want to) believe is that such criterion might encoded in Fourier coefficients of a certain modular form (or automorphic forms in general).

It was assigned to me as a homework problem for one of my classes. (In that vein I would prefer to only have nudges in the right direction, rather than full solutions.) The discussion in this section ( $\S 15.2$ ) is essentially on Legendre polynomials and Fourier-Legendre series. It is quite obvious that the integral evaluates to $2$ , so the problem is ultimately showing that $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty (4n+3) \left( \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n+2)!!} \right)^2 = 1$$ However, browsing the text, Wikipedia , and MathWorld don't give me any enlightening ideas on what identities to leverage.

The identity does seem true. Taking the equivalent formulation of the problem (as a series equaling $1$ ) and summing $n=0$ to $n=100$ yields a result of about $0.996$ according to Wolfram , and up to $n=10,000$ yields about $0.999354$ ( Wolfram ), so it seems reasonable it converges to $1$ , albeit somewhat slowly. The original problem is in multiple parts: this is part (a), and part (c) notes, as I did, the integral $\int_{-1}^1 \sigma^2(x)dx = 2$ . So it also seems plausible that I'm not even meant to calculate the integral at the outset, but instead utilize some other method. I suppose one could rewrite $\sigma$ as $$ \sigma(x) = \begin{cases} P_0(x) & x \in (0,1) \\ -P_0(x) & x \in (-1,0) \end{cases}$$ and perhaps utilize some sort of identity used in the motivations/derivations tied to Legendre polynomials (a lot of integrals of $P_n^2$ seem to come up), but this rewriting doesn't give me anything more enlightening to work with.

However, in the case of the ball/sphere relationship we simply change the equality to an inequality: $$
S^n:\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2=r^2 \Leftrightarrow B^n : \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2<r^2
$$ I've read that the Clifford Torus splits the 3-sphere into 2 congruent tori. I've also read that it's interior is equivalent to its exterior. Does this mean that if we look at the Clifford Torus on its own, without the 3-sphere, that it has no interior? Like a Klein Bottle? Or does it still have an interior? I have seen it is possible to define the Clifford Torus like this: $$
CT: x^2+y^2 = \frac{r^2}{2} = z^2+w^2
$$ Would I be correct in thinking that this ""interior"" (call it a Clifford Donut) is given by: $$
CD: x^2+y^2 < \frac{r^2}{2} > z^2+w^2
$$ Or is it more subtle than that? Honestly I'm not entirely sure what an ""inside"" means anymore, and it seems inconceivable to me that something effectively two-dimensional (In the same way as S^2) could ""enclose"" a four-dimensional ""volume"". It would be like a line wrapping up in 3d to enclose a space such that you could pour water in it.","['geometric-interpretation', 'general-topology']"

Assume that $$2^{-1} \C{2k}{k} \equiv a \pmod{p},\quad -2k \le a \le 2k$$ then $\sqrt{p-a^2}$ is an integer.

The question is that although $a,b$ seem to have equal status, this calculation can only find out one of the two numbers. Also, the calculation does not ensure that $a^2 \lt p$ but all the results meet this condition, so I suspect the combinatorial number to be an approximation of some transcendental function. I also hope to get some further studying if anyone learns about what is behind the method. Bonus : A similar result is given when $p=6k+1 (k \in \Bbb{Z}^+)$ is a prime.

3849887,Solving the heat equation in spherical polars with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions,"Trying to find the series solution of $r\rho''+2\rho'-\lambda r \rho = f$ with certain ICs & BCs. Question: what is wrong with solution strategy (numerical check does not confirm result). My question: What function describes the internal temperature change of a spherical body with some initial temperature profile when its surroundings is heated up? Plan Set up equation governing heat transfer Put it into spherical polar coordinates Set up Initial & Boundary Conditions Obtain two separated equations using separation of variables, as
here, in a different setup Obtain solutions for those: [THIS IS WHERE IT GOES WRONG] Temporal one hopefully be a first order ODE, some exponential as solution Spatial one probably will be more complicated, use: series solution Apply IC & BC to fix constants in the general solutions, get final result Execution $\dot{u} = \alpha \Delta u$ , $R \geq r \geq 0$ , $R$ being the radius of
the sphere, $t \geq 0$ . Since we expect a spherically symmetric
solution, $u=u(r,t)$ . $u$ it does not depend on $\theta$ & $\phi$ . $\dot{u} = \alpha \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2\frac{\partial u}{\partial r})$ . Since $u$ is only a function of $r$ & $t$ , we can ignore the $\theta$ & $\phi$ dependence of $\Delta$ . IC: $u(r \leq R,t=0) = f(r)$ (ie initial internal temperature of the spherical object) BC: $u(r=R,t>0) = T_f$ (ie temperature of heated up surroundings
, heating up taken as instantaneous) Let $u=T(t)\rho(r)$ .
Separated equations: temporal: $T' = \lambda \alpha T$ spatial: $r\rho''+2\rho'-\lambda r \rho = 0$ (similarly to this & this ) Solutions: Temporal: $T(t)=Ae^{\lambda \alpha t}$ Spatial:
let $\rho(r) = \sum_0^{\infty}c_n r^n$ . (Not allowing negative powers because we would like to have a real solution at $r=0$ as well.) Substitute this in to the equation for $\rho$ : $$r\sum_2^{\infty}n(n-1)c_nr^{n-2}+2\sum_1^{\infty}nc_nr^{n-1}-\lambda r\sum_0^{\infty}c_n r^n=0$$ which is equal to: $$\sum_2^{\infty}n(n-1)c_nr^{n-1}+2\sum_1^{\infty}nc_nr^{n-1}-\lambda \sum_0^{\infty}c_n r^{n+1}=0$$ In the first sum, change every $n$ to $n+2$ & lower the lower limit of summation by 2. In the second sum, change every $n$ to $n+1$ & lower the lower limit of summation by 1. Obtain: $$\sum_0^{\infty}(n+2)(n+1)c_{n+2}r^{n+1}+2(n+1)c_{n+1}r^{n}-\lambda c_{n}r^{n+1} = 0$$ The above equation can only be true if it is true for each powers of $r$ . Consider the $r^{n+1}$ terms: $$(n+2)(n+1)c_{n+2} - \lambda c_n = -2(n+2)c_{n+2}$$ Rearrange: $$(n+4)(n+1)c_{n+2}=\lambda c_n$$ Rewrite: $$(n+2)(n-1)c_n = \lambda c_{n-2}$$ Obtain recurrence relation: $$c_n = \frac{\lambda c_{n-2}}{(n+2)(n-1)}$$ To not to get into trouble with zero division, lets set $c_{-1}$ to $0$ , rendering all $c_{n=odd}$ zero. We are free to choose $c_0$ , determining all even coefficients.
Let's plot this & check that we are right!
Using $c_0=\lambda=1$ , computed an approximation to $\rho$ using $c_n$ s up to $n=100$ . Also computed an approximation to $r\rho''+2\rho'-\lambda r \rho$ , which should be zero. (Notebook available here , the code is also on the bottom of this post.)
Unfortunately, it isn't: (Note that this post has a very similar homogeneous equation to mine, but it doesn't use series solutions, but claims that this equation ""integrates into"" the solution.) We obtain: $u=T(t,A)\rho(c_0,r)$ . Even if my $\rho$ function was
correct, BC hardly seem satisfiably for general $f$ with these
constants. Am I missing something? I recall in school (/uni) we
solved the homogeneous case, when $f$ is $0$ , obtained a general
solution, then changed $f$ to something nonzero, found a particular
solution, then added the general & the particular solutions. My plan for this: Find orthonormal eigenfunctions $y_n$ & eigenvalues $\sigma_n$ for $Ly_n=\sigma_n y_n$ , with $L = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+\frac{2}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$ Fix $T(t=0)=1$ , rewrite IC as $rL\rho=r(L\rho_g + L\rho_p) = rL\rho_p = f$ , ie $L\rho_p=f/r$ where $\rho_g$ & $\rho_p$ are the general & particular solutions in the $u$ , where $u=T(t)\rho(r)=T(t)(\rho_{general}(r)+\rho_{particular}(r))$ , $u$ solving $\dot{u} = \alpha \Delta u$ . Let $\rho_p=\sum_0^{\infty}s_n y_n$ Since $$\langle L\rho_p | y_m \rangle = \langle L\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}s_n y_n | y_m \rangle = \langle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}s_n L y_n | y_m \rangle = \langle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}s_n \sigma_n y_n | y_m \rangle = s_n \sigma_n \langle  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}y_n | y_m \rangle = s_m \sigma_m
\implies {s_m=\frac{\langle L\rho_p | y_m \rangle}{\sigma_m}},$$ where $\langle f | g \rangle = \int_{all space} f g dV = \int_r=0^{\infty} \int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} \int_{\phi=0}^{\pi} f(r, \phi, \theta) g(r, \theta, \phi) r^2 \sin(\phi) dr d\phi d\theta$ . Therefore, I can compute all $s_n$ s, therefore obtain $\rho_p$ , giving me a $\rho=\rho_g+\rho_p$ , with which I can satisfy the BC & IC: $\rho_g$ will satisfy BC, while $\rho_p$ will satisfy IC.

3850078,Calling the firefighters,"Consider the following problem: Suppose a house with $n$ apartments is on fire. Every person living there can call the firefighters. Suppose the call costs $1 \$ $ . If at least one person calls firefighters the fire will be extinguished. If noone calls them, then the house will burn down and everyone living there will lose $m \$ $ of property ( $m > 1$ ). The people living in this house do not talk to each other and decide to call or not to call completely independently. For what $n$ the firefighters are less likely to be called? The solution is the following one: People living in the house not talking to each other means that we need to find a symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium. Suppose $\alpha$ is the probability of any given person calling the firefighters. Then anyones expected gain (in comparison to the situation when everything burns down) is $$(1 - \alpha)^{n-1} \alpha (m - 1) + (1 - (1 - \alpha))^{n - 1} (\alpha (m - 1) + (1 - \alpha) m) = m - \alpha - (1 - \alpha)^n m$$ Let’s find for which $\alpha$ it is maximised. $$\frac{\partial (m - \alpha - (1 - \alpha)^n m)}{\partial \alpha} = -1 + n (1 - \alpha)^{n-1} m$$ Thus the point of extremum is $$\alpha = 1 - (\frac{1}{m n})^{\frac{1}{n-1}} = \frac{\ln (n)}{n} + \frac{\ln(m)}{n} + O(\frac{\ln^2(n)}{n^2})$$ This indeed is what we need: the total value at this point is greater than at both ends of $[0; 1]$ . Now, when we know $\alpha$ let’s calculate the probability of firefighters being called. It is $1 - (1 - \alpha)^{n} = 1 - (\frac{1}{m n})^{1 + \frac{1}{n - 1}}$ . It is not hard to see, that it is $1$ (it’s maximal possible value) both when $n = 1$ and $n \to \infty$ . Thus the minimum is reached in the internal infimum. $$\frac{\partial (1 - (\frac{1}{m n})^{1 + \frac{1}{n - 1}})}{\partial n} =  - (\frac{1}{m n})^{1 + \frac{1}{n - 1}} \frac{1 + \ln(m) - \ln(n) - n}{n - 1}$$ Thus the minimum is reached when $m = n e^{n - 1}$ . So the answer is $n = W(e m) = \ln(m) - \ln(\ln(m)) + o(1)$ Now, let’s make the problem a bit more complex: Suppose a house with $n$ apartments is on fire. Every person living there can call the firefighters. Suppose the call costs $1 \$ $ . If anyone calls firefighters the fire will be extinguished. If no-one calls them, then the house will burn down and $i$ -th person living there will lose $X_i \$ $ of property ( $X_i > 1$ ). Everyone knows only their value of $X_i$ and consider the corresponding values of everyone else to be i.i.d. random values, uniformly distributed on $[1;m]$ ( $m > 1$ ). The people living in this house do not talk to each other and decide to call or not to call completely independently. For what $n$ the firefighters are less likely to be called? I attempted to use a similar method: look for a symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium and see what is happening there, however the problem appears to be much trickier. Now, the strategy of each player is defined not as a single value $\alpha$ (probability of calling the firefighters), but as a function $\alpha: [1; +\infty) \to [0; 1]$ , where $\alpha(x)$ is the probability of any given player calling the firefighters if they know they lose $x$ dollars if the fire will not be extinguished. Then for a fixed $X_i = x$ the expected gain of the $i$ -th player will be $$x - \alpha(x) - x(1 - \alpha(x)) E (\Pi_{j \leq n, j \neq i}(1 - \alpha(X_j))) = x - \alpha(x) - x (1 - \alpha(x))  \big(\frac{\int_1^m (1 - \alpha(t))dt}{m - 1}\big)^{n-1}$$ And here I am stuck because I do not know how to find the function $\alpha$ (dependent on $m$ ) for which $x - \alpha(x) - x (1 - \alpha(x))  \big(\frac{\int_1^m (1 - \alpha(t))dt}{m - 1}\big)^{n-1}$ is maximal for every $x \in [1; m]$ .

It can’t be any interval of $\mathbb{R},$ if it was, then it would be infinite. If we have a set of $n$ real numbers, that set would be finite. So a finite set on $\mathbb{R}$ is a set of the form $X = \{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n\}$ for some non-negative integer $n,$ where each $a_i$ is a real number, for all $i \in \{1,\cdots,n\}.$ By definition, $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is $\text{co-}
\mathcal{W},$ if $\mathbb{R}-X$ has property $\mathcal{W}.$ So, in order to have a set $X$ that is $\text{co-}\mathcal{W},$ we require $\mathbb{R}-X$ to be finite.

So the union of $\text{co-}\mathcal{W}$ subsets will be infinite. From here how can I determine, that this union is or is not $\text{co-}\mathcal{W}?$ For the next exercise, we have the case that A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\text{co-}\mathcal{W}$ if and only if it has at most $7$ elements.

UPDATE 10/04/2020 : The dimension of $W$ is at least four because $W$ contains the constants, the square function, the characteristic function of the numbers divisible by $4$ ( $f(n)=1$ if $n$ is divisible by 4, and $f(n)=0$ otherwise), and the characteristic function of the odd numbers. Here's what the beginning of the sequence corresponding to $f(1)=-1$ , $f(k)=0$ for $2\leq k \leq 6$ looks like : $-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 55, 58, 59, 62, 64, 68, 70, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 86, 90, 92, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 112, 116$ The sequence seems to be nondecreasing (from the ninth term on)  and nonnegative (except for the first term).","['functional-equations', 'arithmetic', 'linear-algebra']"
3850127,Induced and generated sigma-algebras,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$ be a measurable space, $\mathcal C \subseteq \mathcal F$ a collection of generators, and $B \in \mathcal F$ a measurable set. I am wondering whether $$
\sigma(\mathcal C \cap B) = \sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B ;
$$ in other words, does the sigma-algebra on $B$ generated by the elements of $\mathcal C$ ""restricted to"" $B$ coincide with the sigma-algebra induced on $B$ by the generated sigma-algebra? Above, I am using the notation $\mathcal C \cap B = \{ A \cap B \, | \, A \in \mathcal C \}$ , and $\sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B$ is defined in the same way. This seems like it should be easy to prove, and at least one inclusion is obvious: because every element of $\mathcal C \cap B$ is in $\sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B$ , we have $\sigma(\mathcal C \cap B) \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B$ , since $\sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B$ is a sigma-algebra on $B$ . However, I do not know whether the reverse inclusion is true. My idea is to explicitly describe the sets in $\sigma(\mathcal C)$ . In my notation, this Wikipedia page says, "" $\sigma(\mathcal C)$ consists of all the subsets of $\Omega$ that can be made from elements of $\mathcal C$ by a countable number of complement, union and intersection operations."" If this is true, then it may be possible to take a set $A \cap B \in \sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B$ , represent $A$ as described, and ""commute"" the intersection with $B$ with all the union/intersection/complement operations from which $A$ is derived. For example, suppose $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ is a countable union of elements of $\mathcal C$ . Then $$
A \cap B = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (A_i \cap B) ,
$$ and the right-hand side is now in $\sigma(\mathcal C \cap B)$ . However, this only seems possible when $A$ is derived from a finite number of such operations, as above (which I count as a single union operation). This leads me to two questions: How can Wikipedia's description be formulated? I believe it could be read as $$ \sigma(\mathcal C) = \bigg\{ \mathop{\color{red}{\ast}}\limits_{i_1=1}^{\infty} \mathop{\color{red}{\ast}}\limits_{i_1=2}^{\infty} \dotso \mathop{\color{red}{\ast}}\limits_{i_n=1}^{\infty} B_{i_1, \dotsc, i_n} \, \bigg| \, B_{i_1,\dotsc,i_n} \in \mathcal C \cup \{\varnothing\} \text{ or } B_{i_1,\dotsc,i_n}^c \in \mathcal C \bigg\} , $$ where each $\color{red}{\ast}$ may stand for either the symbol $\bigcap$ or $\bigcup$ , for severe want of better notation. Here, the sets $B$ are the elements of $\mathcal C$ and their complements, or the empty set. Unless I am mistaken, the collection written above is a sigma-algebra containing $\mathcal C$ , and it is easily seen to be the smallest such. Assuming the collection above correctly describes $\sigma(\mathcal C)$ , this should prove the reverse inclusion, i.e. $\sigma(\mathcal C) \cap B \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal C \cap B)$ . Is there a way to show this inclusion that does not rely on an explicit description of $\sigma(\mathcal C)$ ?","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory', 'real-analysis']"

I want to use a direct proof and a proof by contraposition. The direct - in short - is just that The prime factorization of $n=2^x$ is $2^x$ and is unique so no other divisors that are not factored - only by power of $2$ . The contraposition is Assume the opposite, that $n = 2^m$ ( $m$ a positive integer) is divisible by the odd number $2D + 1$ , where $D$ is a positive integer. That is, $2^m = (2D + 1)(Q)$ , where $Q$ is the positive integer quotient. Since the left side is an even number, $Q$ must be an even number too because the product of two odd numbers is odd. So $Q = 2R$ , for a positive integer $R$ . Therefore, $2^m = (2D + 1)(2R)$ . dividing both sides by $2$ yields $2^{m-1} = (2D + 1)(R)$ Repeat this process until either the power of $2$ on the left side becomes $1$ , or the quotient on the right side becomes $1$ . But then the left side will be even but right side will be odd. A contradiction. Therefore the original statement must be true. Is this proof and approach correct?

3850310,Subgroups defined by negative formulas,"I start with a simple problem that I was able to solve: Let $G$ be a group. Let $a\in G$ . Assume that $H := \{g \in G : g^2 \neq a\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ . The question: Can we define $H$ with a ""positive"" formula, not involving the symbol $\neq$ ? The answer in this case is positive. Most of the time $H=G$ , and in this case $H$ is defined by the positive formula $1=1$ , but other times $H = \{g \in G : g^2 = 1\}$ . My intuition is that subgroups defined with a formula should look like closed subsets of a topology and therefore they should be defined with a ""positive"" formula. For $a, b \in G$ , one could look at subgroups defined by the equation $gag \neq b$ , or more generally by the equation $w(g)\neq 1$ for some word $w(x)$ . I believe all such subgroups should be defined by positive formulas. Any ideas or counter-examples or any known researches?

The statement to prove is as follows: Let $f$ be defined on an open interval $I$ , and let $c \in I$ . If $f$ is differentiable at $c$ , then $f$ is also continuous at $c$ . The proof given is as follows: If $f$ is differentiable at $c$ , then there is some number $f'(c)$ such that $$\lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} = f'(c)$$ It follows that $$ \begin{align} \lim_{x\rightarrow c} (f(x) - f(c)) &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}\biggl(\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{(x-c)}(x-c)\biggl) \\ & = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{(x-c)} \times \lim_{x\rightarrow c}{(x-c)}\\ &= f'(c) \times 0 \\ &= 0 \end{align}$$ Hence by the sum and multiple rules* for limits, $$\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)$$ This starred * comment refers to an earlier proved results about limits of functions which states that IF $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = l$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} g(x) = m$ , then $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} (f(x)-g(x)) = l - m$ Am I correct in thinking that using this result is invalid? For example, how do we know a priori that $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)$ exists? (If it exists then we can apply the limit rule, but before proving this I don't see how we can use the converse of the limit rule, which doesn't seem to be true to me?) My reasoning to complete the proof would be to use the sequential definition of a limit of a function: Since $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} (f(x) - f(c)) = 0$ , we have that for an arbitrary sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_n$ converges to $c$ , the sequence $\{f(x_n) - f(c)\}$ converges to $0$ (by definition). Since $f(c)$ is a constant, we can conclude that the sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ converges to $f(c)$ . THEN , since $\{x_n\}$ was arbitrary, this is true for every sequence converging to $c$ , and by the sequential definition of limits of a function, we can conclude that $\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)$ Is my previous paragraph correct or is it pedantry?

Let this constant be $-\lambda$ (with $\lambda > 0$ so we get an exponential decay rather than growth for the temporal equation). Temporal eq: $$T'=-\lambda \alpha T$$ which implies: $$T(t)=A e^{-\lambda \alpha t}$$ Spatial eq: $$X''+\lambda X = 0$$ having a solution: $$X(x) = B e^{\sqrt{-\lambda}x}+Ce^{-\sqrt{-\lambda}x}$$ which, since $\lambda>0$ , can be rewritten to: $$X(x) = B \sin(\sqrt{\lambda}x) + C \cos(\sqrt{\lambda}x)$$ Where issues begin If we had $u(x=0,L;t) = 0$ , I would be confident to use these to determine $\lambda$ & C to be: $$\lambda = \frac{n^2 \pi^2}{L^2}$$ $$C=0$$ Then, proceed by setting $A=1$ , so we have: $$u(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right) e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi^2}{L^2}\alpha t}$$ Then, determine $B_n$ s using orthogonality of the different frequency sine functions: $$B_n = \frac{2}{L}\int_0^Lf(x)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)dx$$ How do I attempt to tackle them Despite my IC is not $u(x=0,L;t) = 0$ , I have some hope for this path. Now my solution is: $$u(x,t) = e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi^2}{L^2}\alpha t} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{2}{L}\left(\int_0^Lf(x)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)dx\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)$$ Which I believe satisfies my IC but not my BCs. Don't worry, lets add to $X(x)$ a line which make it satisfy the BCs as well (which are: $u(x=0,t>0)=T_f$ & $u(x=L,t>0)=T_i$ ). Let's call this $X_p$ : $$X_p(x) = \frac{T_i-T_f}{L}x$$ Now if I just add this to the previously found $X$ , I will obviously screw up the $B_n$ s, which were calculated such a way that the weighted sum of sines will give me $f(x)$ . If I just add $X_p$ , the weighted sum of sines and $X_p$ will give me $f(x)+X_p$ . Lets subtract $X_p$ from $f(x)$ when calculating the coefficeients of the sines, that way the weighted sum of the sines and $X_p$ will give me $f(x)-X_p+X_p = f(x)$ in $t=0$ , which is good, and in $t>0$ I still satisfy my BCs because I have added $X_p$ to the general solution. Where I arrive So my final result is: $$u(x,t) = e^{-\frac{n^2 \pi^2}{L^2}\alpha t} \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{2}{L}\left(\int_0^L\left(f(x) - \frac{T_i-T_f}{L}x\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)dx\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L}x\right)+\frac{T_i-T_f}{L}x\right)$$ Question Is this a right way of obtaining the solution to the equation, or is it completely off track? Is there a name for the different steps I am using? If there is a standard way of solving these kind of equations which is not this way, I'd like to know.

My question : can we construct a map $(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ that's ${\mathbb Q}$ -affine but not ${\mathbb R}$ -affine ? My thoughts : $f$ cannot be continuous, obviously. If $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_r$ are $\mathbb Q$ -linearly independent positive real numbers and $C$ is the cone generated by them (so that $C$ is the set of all $\sum_{k=1}^{r} r_k\alpha_k $ where the $r_k$ are nonnegative rationals), then the map $f : C \to C$ defined by $$

Unfortunately, although there are Hamel bases of $\mathbb R$ over $\mathbb Q$ and we can certainly choose one to contain only positive numbers (replacing each negative base element by its opposite),  some positive real numbers will inevitably have some negative coordinates in this base so this seems to be a dead end.

The unary union differs from the binary union $X \cup Y$ both algebraically (e.g. by arity), and set-theoretically: it may produce a set of a lower rank than the rank of its operand (one can say that the unary union operation may ""lower the rank""). This last fact is in contrast with the fact that the binary union produces a set of a rank which equals the highest rank of its arguments  (one can say the  binary union ""does not lower the rank""). Recall, the rank of a set is the least ordinal number greater than the rank of any member of the set. An attractive propery of the unary union is that it can be used in an elegant definition of the notion ""transitive set"" due to this: $\bigcup X \subseteq X$ iff $X$ is a transitive set. There are also two interesting types of sets $X$ defined by each of the formulas $X \subseteq \bigcup X$ and $X = \bigcup X$ , but I don't have enough experience with set theory to have encountered them in any theorems and to know names for them. Anyway, the unary union is a very interesting operation because it sometimes lowers the rank of the set to which it is applied, unlike the widely used binary operations of union, intersection, and difference.

To this end, I need to show every Cauchy sequence in this space with respect to the metric $d$ converges in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ .

Edit 2: A possible solution: Okay, I think I solved it using isometry. I am not sure if I am correct, so I added a tag of proof verification. The followings are the complete proof: Denote $\overline{\mathbb{R}}:=[-\infty,\infty]$ . We firstly need to extend the definition of $d(x,y)$ such that it is defined on such a space. That is, we further define $$d(x,y):=\left\{

		\frac{\pi}{2}-\arctan (y)\ \ \text{if}\ \ x=\infty\ \ \text{and}\ \ y\in\mathbb{R}\\

		\pi\ \ \text{if}\ \ x=-\infty\ \ \text{and}\ \ y=\infty.
		\end{array}
\right.
$$ As $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\arctan(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow-\infty}\arctan(x)=-\frac{\pi}{2}$ , the above extended definition is clearly well-defined.

		\arctan(x)\ \ \text{if}\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}\\
		\frac{\pi}{2}\ \ \text{if}\ \ x=\infty\\
		-\frac{\pi}{2}\ \ \text{if}\ \ x=-\infty.
		\end{array}
\right.
$$ Then, defining $d'(x,y):=|x-y|$ , we see that for any $a,b\in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ , we have $$d'(f(a),f(b))=d(a,b).$$ Therefore, we see that $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},d)$ and $([-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}],d')$ are isometric. Hence, it follows from general topology that $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},d)$ is complete if and only if $([-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}],d')$ is complete. But note that $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ is compact with respect to the usual metric $d'$ , and we recall from general topology that every compact metric space is complete. Hence, $([-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}],d')$ is complete. The proof is then concluded. Please let me know if I am correct!","['metric-spaces', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification', 'general-topology']"
3851704,"Find the critical points of the function $f(x,y)=e^{-xy}\sin (xy).$","Find the critical points of the function $f :\mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$ defined by : $f(x,y)=e^{-xy}\sin (xy).$ My attempts : we have $\nabla f(x,y)= e^{-xy}\begin{pmatrix}  -y\sin(xy)+y\cos(xy)& -x\sin(xy)+x\cos(xy) \end{pmatrix}$ , thus $$\nabla f(x,y)=(0 \quad0) \iff \begin{cases} y=0 \text{ or } \tan(xy)=1 & \\ x=0 \text{ or} \tan(xy)=1 \end{cases} ,$$ $\tan(xy)=1 \iff xy= n\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{4},$ so if $y=0$ , then $x=0$ and if $y\neq 0$ , then $x=\frac{1}{y}\left( n\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)$ . Thus $(0,0)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{y}\left( n\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right),y\right)$ are the critical points.

3851708,Extending injectivity of closed sets in injective immersions,"I am trying to do the following exercise : A $C^1$ immersion $f:M\rightarrow N$ which is injective on a closed subset $F\subset M$ is injective on a neighborhood of $F$ . In fact $f$ has a neighborhood $ V\subset C_S^1(M,N)$ and $F$ has a neighborhood $U\subset M$ such that every $g\in V$ is injective on $U$ . If $K$ is compact $V$ can be taken in $C_W^1(M,N)$ . Focusing only on the first part of the problem that is the part where can extend injectivity of closed sets ininjective immersions.
I have been thinking about this for a while and there are two ideas, either I construct the neighborhood , I have tried this using the fact that $f$ is locally injective , or I go by contradiction but I can't get anytihing. Either way I got nowhere useful and was wondering if there is anything else that I can try or if there is something I am missing ? Any advice on this is aprecciated. Thanks !","['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
