2806026,$\Bbb R^2 \to \Bbb R$ limit problem from Hubbard & Hubbard (Exercise 1.5.24),"For what positive integers a, b, c, and d, where $c \le d$, does the limit as $\begin{pmatrix} x\\ y\\ \end{pmatrix} \to \begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ \end{pmatrix}$ of $$\frac{x^ay^b}{x^{2c}+y^{2d}} \quad \text{exist?}$$ This is a minor modification of problem 1.5.24 on p 104 of Hubbard & Hubbard's Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms:  A Unified Approach (5th edition,  ISBN 9780971576681, pub by Matrix Editions). H & H said a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers and didn't specify $\,$ $c\le d$ , but $c\le d$ may be assumed without loss of generality, and if we allow any exponent to be 0 there are lots of trivial cases to deal with, all of which I can solve. This is what I've proven so far: 1) $\,$If $\,a \gt c \,$ and $\, b \gt d\,$  the limit is 0.$\,$ But I don't know what happens in general if $ \,a \le c \,$ or $ \,b \le d$. 2) $\,$ If $a \gt 2c \,$ or $\, b \gt 2d\,$ the limit is 0. $\,$  But I don't what happens if $\, a \le 2c \,$  and  $\,b \le 2d$. 3) $\,$  If $ \,a+b \le 2c \,$ the limit does not exist, and if  $\, a+b \gt 2d \,$ the limit is 0.  $\,$ But I don't know what $\quad$ happens if  $\, 2c \lt a+b \le 2d$. 4) If $\,ad + cb \le 2cd \,$ the limit does not exist, which implies that if  $\,a \le c \,$  and $\, b \le d \,$ then the limit $\quad$ also does not exist. $\,$But I don't know what happens if  $ \,ad + cb > 2cd$. Since at this point in the book H & H haven't even defined partial derivatives, I'm hoping for a proof that requires nothing fancier than AP BC calculus and the basic limit definitions and properties of limits for functions from $R^n$ into $R^m$. But any proof or help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
2806036,Homology/Cohomology Theories for Non-Locally Connected Spaces,"This is a very general question.  I am wondering what homology or cohomology theories have been developed for the analysis of spaces which are not locally connected.  Particularly, theories that extend singular or simplicial homology, or Cech cohomology, which is basically all that I am familiar with. For the area I am interested in, it would be fine to assume that the underlying spaces are locally compact, indeed even compact. Are there any such theories that have proven more useful over the years?  Particularly in finite or one dimensional cases.  The only thing I have really heard of in this direction is shape theory.","['homology-cohomology', 'continuum-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'geometric-topology', 'general-topology']"

2806111,Divergence theorem and change of coordinates,"A friend and I were working on a Calculus (III) assignment and we both came to different results, but I can't figure out just why. It was something like the following: If $F(x,y,z)=(x^3,y^3,z)$ and $K$ is the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$, calculate the flux of $F$ through $K$ utilizing the divergence theorem. (Spherical coordinates could be useful). We are supposed to solve this by using Wolfram Mathematica. This is what we did: Me: I changed the coordinates system right away from cartesian to spherical, and got 
$$
F'=(\rho^3\sin^3\theta\sin^3\phi,\rho^3\cos^3\theta\sin^3\phi,\rho\cos\phi).$$ I then calculated the divergence for spherical coordinates and got $$Div(F')=\rho^2\sin^2\phi\left(4\cos\phi\cos^3\theta+5\sin\phi\sin^3\theta\right).
$$
Finally, the flux would be 
$$
f_1=\int_0^\pi\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1 Div(F')\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi=0
$$ Them: First, calculating the divergence of $F$ for cartesian coordinates, they got $$Div(F)=1+3x^2+3y^2.$$ Then, changing the coordinates: 
$$
Div(F')=1+\rho^2\left(3\cos^2\theta\sin^2\phi+3\sin^2\phi\sin^2\theta\right)
$$ Finally, the flux would be $$f_2=\int_0^\pi\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1 Div(F')\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi=\frac{44\pi}{15}$$ Why are the results different? Why is there a difference in calculating the divergence before and after the change of coordinates? Note 1: I suspect I'm wrong here.

2806256,Need help interpreting this statement regarding probability,"I was reading this text on probability and I have confusion interpreting a statement. The text reads as follows: Sampling is a very common technique for estimating the fraction of
  elements in a set that have a certain property. For example, suppose
  that you would like to know how many Americans plan to vote for the
  Republican candidate in the next presidential election. It is
  infeasible to ask every American how they intend to vote, so pollsters
  will typically contact n Americans selected at random and then compute
  the fraction of those Americans that will vote republican. This value
  is then used as the estimate of the number of all Americans that will
  vote Republican. For example, if 45% of the n contacted voters report
  that they will vote Republican, the pollster reports that 45% of all
  Americans will vote Republican. In addition, the pollster will usually
  also provide some sort of qualifying statement such as ""There is a 95% probability that the poll is accurate to within (+/-)
  4 percentage points."" Many people interpret the qualifying statement to mean that there is a
  95% chance that between 41% and 49% of Americans intend to vote
  Republican. But this is wrong! Later they do a bit of math and conclude with the actual meaning of that qualifying statement and thus say that: There is a 95% chance that the sample group will produce an estimate
  that is within (+/-) 4 percentage points of the correct value for the
  overall population. So either we were “unlucky” in selecting the
  people to poll or the results of the poll will be correct to within
  (+/-) 4 points. I don't see any difference between the two interpretations. Can anyone please help? What I understand from their last statement is that there is a 95% chance that the result they obtained from that particular sample group (i.e., 45% of Americans will vote Republican) is within (+/-) 4 % of the correct fraction (Let it be p). So in other words there is 95% chance that 'p' is between 0.41 and 0.49, which is precisely what the first interpretation (which they consider wrong) meant.","['probability-theory', 'sampling', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2806259,Integral $\int_0^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(3-\cos x)}dx$,"Greetings I tried to evaluate $$I=\int_0^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(3-\cos x)}dx$$ Here is my try, it is abit longer, but I wrote it all so that I wont have a silly mistake. My main ideea was to expand into fourier series $$g(t)=\frac{1}{3-\cos t}$$ so I took(I am not sure if it's correct but that is how I learned) $$a_0=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{3-\cos t}dt$$ $$a_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\cos(nt)}{3-\cos t}dt$$$$b_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin(nt)}{3-\cos t}dt$$ $$a_n+ib_n=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{e^{int} }{3-\cos t}dt$$ we let $$e^{it}=z \rightarrow dt=\frac{dz}{iz}\, ; |z|=1$$ And we can write $\cos t=\frac{z^2+1}{2z}$ $$a_n+ib_n=\frac{2}{i\pi}\int_{|z|=1} \frac{z^n}{-z^2+6z-1}dz$$our function $$g(z)= \frac{z^n}{-z^2+6z-1}$$ has in the interior of the circle $|z|=1$ simple poles at: $$-z^2+6z-1=0\rightarrow-(z-3)^2+8=0$$giving $$z_1=3-2\sqrt{2}$$ the other pole is not in the circle. So $$\frac{2}{i\pi}\int_{|z|=1} g(z)dz=2\pi i Res(g;z_1)$$ $$Res(g;3-2\sqrt 2)=\lim_{z\to 3-2\sqrt 2} \, \frac{z^n}{z-(3+2\sqrt 2)}=\frac{(3-2\sqrt 2)^n}{-4\sqrt 2}+i\cdot 0$$ Thus the $b_n$ term vanishes and $$a_n=\frac{(3-2\sqrt 2)^n}{-4\sqrt 2}\rightarrow a_0=-\frac{1}{4\sqrt 2}$$ so as a fourier series we have $$g(t)=-\frac{1}{8\sqrt 2}-\frac{1}{4\sqrt 2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(nt)}{(3+2\sqrt2)^n}$$ So we can rewrite the original integral as $$I=-\frac{1}{8\sqrt 2}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx-\frac{1}{4\sqrt 2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(3+2\sqrt 2)^n}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\cos(nx)}{1+x^2}dx$$ The first integral is simple, and the second one is well known around here to be $\frac{\pi}{2e^n}$ see for example: Integral evaluation $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\cos (ax)}{\pi (1+x^2)}dx$ so I get $$I=-\frac{\pi}{8\sqrt 2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(e(3+2\sqrt 2))^n}\right)=-\frac{\pi}{16\sqrt 2}\left(\frac{3 e+2e\sqrt 2+ 1}{3e+2e\sqrt 2 - 1}\right) $$

We get $ x_{(1)}, ...,x_{(n)}$ For $\alpha \in [0,\frac{1}{2}) $ we define the $\alpha$-trimmed mean : $$ T_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{n-2\lceil{\alpha n}\rceil}  \sum_{i=\lceil{\alpha n}\rceil +1}^{n-\lceil{\alpha n}\rceil} x_{(i)}$$ and the sample mean is : $$ S= \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{(i)} $$ $1)$ What happens when a fraction of the observations, say $k$ observations, with $k < \alpha\cdot n$, is huge? Illustrate the effect for $k$ observations tending to infinity on the sample mean and on the $\alpha$-trimmed mean. Explain why the $\alpha$-trimmed mean may be problematic in real life applications
  compared to the sample mean. $2)$ Suppose in the setting of part $1)$, that $k \geq 2n \cdot\alpha $. How does this affect the $\alpha$-trimmed mean? $3)$ Explain why the trimmed mean may be advantageous compared to the sample
  mean in a real life application, with respect to its robustness. My idea: For $1)$ I've considered an example. If we have $n=9$ , $\alpha = 0.3$ ( $k$ has to be $2$ then) with: $x_{(1)}=4,x_{(2)}=7,x_{(3)}=8,x{(4)}_=10,x_{(5)}=12,x_{(6)}=23,x_{(7)}=231,x_{(8)}=323333,x_{(9)}=4567564$ Then: $S ≈ 543466$, while $T_{0.3}= 15$. If we now replace $x_{(8)}$ and $x_{(9)}$ by something higher [for example: $400.000$ and $987654321$] (because we want that the $k$ observations tends to infinity ) then we get $S ≈ 109783846$, while $T_{0.3}=15$. So my answer for $1)$ would be that $S$ tending to infinity, while the $k$ observations has no effect on $T_{0.3}$,right? Like you see I have used an example here. Can you help me with the illustration? for the second question of $1)$ I will consider the example above with $\alpha = 0,4$. Then only $x_{(5)}$ would be left. So $T_{0.4} =12 $.  So only one observation decides what the trimmed mean is. This is obviously not good, if you want to make a statement of a certain situation. Is this the answer, which is expected? $2)$ I would say that $T_{\alpha}$ tends to infinity? Because at least one of the observations, which tending to infinity is in $T_{\alpha}$. But my answer is really short? Did I really figure out what the exercise wants to show me? $3)$ So the trimmed mean is obviously less sensitive to outliers than the sample mean and still illustrates the central tendency. ( see that in $(1)$ ) But to be honest: I don't figured out which advantage ""hides"" in $(2)$. Can you help me here? Thank you for your help and correction.","['means', 'statistics']"

2806858,Why do we lose solutions when we divide $2\sin\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta$ by $\sin\theta$?,"There is an equation
$$\sin2\theta=\sin\theta$$
We need to show when the right-hand side is equal to the left-hand side for $[0,2\pi]$. Let's rewrite it as
$$2\sin\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta$$
Let's divide both sides by $\sin\theta$ (then $\sin\theta \neq 0 \leftrightarrow \theta \notin \{0,\pi,2\pi\}$)
$$2\cos\theta=1$$
$$cos\theta=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\theta\in\left\{\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{5\pi}{3}\right\}$$ Now, let's try something different.
$$2\sin\theta\cos\theta=\sin\theta$$
$$2\sin\theta\cos\theta-\sin\theta=0$$
$$\sin\theta(2\cos\theta-1)=0$$
We can have the solution when $\sin\theta=0$.
$$\sin\theta=0$$
$$\theta \in \left\{0,\pi,2\pi\right\}$$
And when $2\cos\theta-1=0$.
$$2\cos\theta-1=0$$
$$2\cos\theta=1$$
$$\cos\theta=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\theta \in \left\{\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{5\pi}{3}\right\}$$
Therefore the whole solution set is
$$\theta \in \left\{0,\pi,2\pi,\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{5\pi}{3}\right\}$$ This is the correct solution. Why is this happening? In the first approach, the extra solution given by $\sin\theta=0$ is not only non-appearing but actually banned. Both approaches look valid to me, yet the first one yields less solutions than the second one. Is the first approach invalid in some cases? This is not the only case when this happens, so I'd like to know when I need to use the second approach to solve the equation, so I don't miss any possible solutions.","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

2806910,Linear regression with 2 unknown intercepts,"The linear equation $y=2.2+0.6(x+1.2)$ has the slope $0.6$, the given y-intercept $2.2$ and x-intercept $-1.2$. The table is $$

1 & 3.52 \\ 
2 & 4.12 \\ 
3 & 4.72 \\ 
4 & 5.32 \\ 
5 & 5.92 \\ \end{array}
$$ From the equation (and the blue line on the graph ) the actual y-intercept is $2.92$ and the actual x-intercept is $-4.8\bar{6}$ ($-4\frac{13}{15}$). When writing a regression for this data, how do I relate the ""actual"" intercepts to the equation input x- and y-intercepts? Here is what I know. From the data I can determine the slope $0.6$, and I know that every regression line with slope $0.6$ has to go through the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ (the means of the x- and y-values) which here is $(3,4.72)$. The line also has to go through the point $(-b_2, b_0)$, which secretly is $(-1.2, 2.2)$. The information I actually know when writing a regression from the data alone is $y=b_0+b_1(x+b_2)$ (linear given) $b_1 = 0.6$ $\bar{x}=3$ $\bar{y}=4.72$ regression line of slope $b_1=0.6$ has the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})=(3,4.72)$ regression line of slope $b_1=0.6$ has the point $(-b_2, b_0)$. The equations for $b_0$ and $b_2$ are simple but co-dependent: $$
b_0 = y - b_1(x+b_2) \\
b_2 = \frac{y-b_0}{-b_1}+x
$$ Let $b_2=0;x=3$ in 
$$
b_0=4.72-0.6(3-0) \\ 
b_0=2.92.
$$
Let $b_0=0;x=3$ in 
$$
b_2 = \frac{4.72-0}{-.6}+3 \\ 
b_2=-4.8\bar{6}.
$$ These are the observed x- and y-intercepts, but not the orginal inputs. Put these back into the original linear equation where $x=3$: $$4.72=2.92+0.6(3+-4.8\bar{6})$$ I find that $4.72=2.92+4.72$ thus $4.72=7.64$. Let $x=3$ in 2-variable derivation of $b_0$ where $y=2.2+0.6(x)$ (1 unknown): $$
\bar{y} = b_0+0.6(\bar{x}) \\
4 = b_0+1.8 \\
2.2 = b_0.
$$
This is correct. If I let $x=3$ and use the same strategy for 3-variable derivation of $b_0$ where $y=2.2+0.6(x+1.2)$ (2 unknowns): $$
\bar{y} = b_0+0.6(\bar{x}+b_2) \\
4.72 = b_0+1.8+.6b_2 \\
2.92 = b_0+0.6b_2. 
$$ The result is balanced: $$
2.92 = 2.2+0.6(1.2) \\
2.92 = 2.2+0.72 \\
2.92 = 2.92. 
$$ but does not give $b_0$ or $b_2$ because they are defined in terms of one another. There are infinitely many real solutions to $2.92 = b_0+0.6b_2$. How shall I decouple the two intercepts to find the original equation $y=2.2+0.6(x+1.2)$ from the data and knowing only the 6 listed facts above?","['linear-regression', 'regression-analysis', 'statistics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'linear-algebra']"

Unlike most other things in mathematics, over time I have gained absolutely no intuition as to why this is the definition. The only explanation I've ever seen is that a set is measurable if it 'breaks up' other sets in the way you'd want. I don't really see why this is the motivation though. One reason I am not comfortable with it is that you require a measurable set to break up sets which, according to this definition, are non-measurable; why would you require that? Of course, you can't say what a non-measurable set is without first defining what it means to be measurable so I suppose no matter what your condition is, it will have to apply to all subsets of $X$. Is there an intuitive way to think about the definition of measurable sets?

Motivation : I'm just teaching my calculus students basic integration of rational functions with $\log$ and $\arctan$ , so I wondered about this. Observation and more precise question : Pairing complex conjugates, over $\mathbb R$ these polynomials split into factors of the forms $x-1$ , $x+1$ , and $$f_{k,n}(x) = x^2-2\cos(2k\pi/n)x +1,$$ where the reciprocal of the last one, if I'm not mistaken, has antiderivative $$\frac{1}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\arctan\left(\frac{x-\cos(2k\pi/n)}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\right).$$ Now using partial fractions and then integrating, one gets summands of the following types: A) $\log|x-1|$ B) $\log|x+1|$ C) $\frac{1}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\arctan\left(\frac{x-\cos(2k\pi/n)}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\right)$ D) $\log (f_{k,n}(x))$ .

Idea : I assume if one goes to $\mathbb C$ one just gets terms of the form $$ \log (x-\zeta)$$ where $\zeta$ runs through the respective roots of unity, and choosing the right branches of $\log$ and grouping complex conjugates together might give a formula for the coefficients. But going through this is beyond me at this point. Edit: From Eric Wofsey's answer one gets, by pairing complex conjugates and using the well-known relation ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) between arctan and complex logarithm (leaving out domain restriction and integration constants): $$\int \frac{dx}{x^n-1} = \color{red}{\frac{1}{n}} \cdot \log|x-1| + \color{blue}{(}(\color{red}{-\frac{1}{n}}) \cdot \log|x+1|\color{blue}{)} + \sum_{1\le k <\frac{n}{2}}  \color{red}{\frac{-2\sin(2k\pi/n)}{n}}\arctan\left(\frac{x-\cos(2k\pi/n)}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\right) + \sum_{1\le k <\frac{n}{2}} \color{red}{\frac{\cos(2k\pi/n)}{n}} \log(f_{n,k})$$ (where the term in $\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$ brackets appears iff $n$ is even), i.e my original normalisation of the arctan-term was bad, would give $C_{n,k} = -2\sin^2(2k\pi/n)/n$ ),; and for $n \ge 3$ , $$\int \frac{dx}{\Phi_n(x)} = 
 \sum_{1\le k <\frac{n}{2}\\gcd(k,n)=1}  \color{red}{-2\cdot\mathfrak{Im}\left(\frac{1}{\Phi'_n(\zeta_k)}\right)}\arctan\left(\frac{x-\cos(2k\pi/n)}{\sin(2k\pi/n)}\right) + \sum_{1\le k <\frac{n}{2}\\gcd(k,n)=1} \color{red}{\mathfrak{Re}\left(\frac{1}{\Phi'_n(\zeta_k)}\right)} \log(f_{n,k})$$ (where $\zeta_{k,n} = \exp(2k\pi i/n)$ ).

2807429,How can I calculate the joint probability for three variable?,"I am a student studying the joint probability density function with multi variables. I understand how to obtain a joint probability density function when two uniform distributions have the following joint distribution like below. The distribution $f_V$(v) can be determined based on the distribution of $t$, denoted as $f_T$(t),and that of $c_i$, denoted by $f_C$(c). The distributions $f_T$(t) and $f_C$(c) are available, e.g., based on the previous observations. Assume that variables $t$ and $c$ are independent from each other and follow uniform distributions, i.e., $t$~ $U[t_{min}; t_{max}]$
and $c$~  $U[c_{min}; c_{max}]$, $c_{min}$ > 0. Then, $f_V$ (v) is determined
as follows. Let, z = c, v = $\frac{t}{c}$ and we have t = vz and c = z. Jacobian determinant $J_D$ among t, c, v and z
is given by $J_D$ = z.
So, the PDF for joint distribution $(v,z)$ is given by
$f_{V,Z}$(v,z) = $f_T$(v,z)$f_C$(z)$|J_D|$ = $\frac{1}{(t_{max} - t_{min})(c_{max}-c_{min})}|z|$. So, the distribution of $v$, $f_V$(v) is determined by 
$f_V$(v) = $\int_{-\infty}^\infty$ $f_{V,Z}$(v,z) $dz$ =  $\int_{c_{min}}^{c_{max}}$ $f_{V,Z}$(v,z)$dz$ = $\frac{c_{min}+c_{max}}{2(t_{max}-t_{min})}$ The question is based on above understanding, I try to do calculations when there are 3 variables.

2807435,$f(x-y)=f(x)f(y)$,"If $f(x-y) = f(x)f(y) $ (Call this equations (1) ) for all $x$ and $y$, and $f(x)\not = 0$ for any $x$, find all possible values for $f(1997)$. My attempt: Substitute $x=y=0$ in $(1)$ to obtain $f(0) = 1$. If you now substitute $x=y=1$ in (1), you get $f(1)^2 = f(0) \implies f(1) = \pm 1$.
  Now if $f(1)=1$, then you can see that $f(2)=1$ as well (by substituting $x=2,y=1$ in $(1)$ ). We can extend this to all natural numbers
  (assume that $f(k)=1 \forall k\in \mathbb{N} \leq n$: \begin{align*}
f((k+1)-1) &= f(k+1)f(1) \\
f(k) &= f(k+1)f(1) \\
f(k+1) &= 1
\end{align*} On the other hand, if $f(1) = -1$, then (as before) $f(2) = 1$. This implies \begin{align*}
f(3-1) &= f(3)f(1) \\
f(2) &= f(3)f(1) \\
f(3) &= -1
\end{align*} This makes us think that $f(n) = (-1)^n \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Indeed, this is the case (assume that it holds for all $k\leq n$): \begin{align*}
f((k+1)-1) &= f(k+1) f(1) \\
f(k) &= f(k+1) f(1) \\
(-1)^k &= f(k+1) f(1) \\
f(k+1) &= (-1)^{k-1} = (-1)^{k+1}
\end{align*} Therefore, all the possible values for $f(1977)$ are $\{1,-1\}$. But apparently, $f(1977) = -1$ is not given in the solution to this problem (this problem is from Richard Rusczyk's and Mathew Crawford's Intermediate Algebra): Setting $y=x$, we get $f(0) = f(x)^2)$. Setting $x=0$, we get $f(0) = f(0)^2$, so $f(0)[f(0) - 1] = 0$. Hence, $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$. But $f(x)$ is never equal to $0$, so $f(0) = 1$. Then $f(x)^2 = 1$ for all x, so $f(x) = -1$ or $f(x) = -1$ for all $x$. Setting $x=2y$ in the given equation, we get $f(y) = f(2y)f(y)$. Since $f(y)$ is nonzero, we may divide both sides by $f(y)$ to get $f(2y)=1$. Since this holds for all $y$, in particular, we have $f(1977) = \boxed{1}$. What did I miss in my solution?
Also, the fact that they did not mention the domain and co-domain of $f$ annoys me.","['functional-equations', 'alternative-proof', 'functions', 'proof-verification']"

So I found two ways to solve the problem: 1. per definition We want to show $(a \boxplus b) \boxplus c = a \boxplus (b \boxplus c)$. $(a \boxplus b) \boxplus c = (2a+2b)*2+2c = 4a+4b+2c.$ And on the other side
$a \boxplus (b \boxplus c) = 2a+2(2b+2c)= 2a+4b+4c$ $4a+4b+2c \neq 2a+4b+4c$. So $\boxplus$ is not assosiative. 2. Show that commutativity implicates associativity We want to proof $
(a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$ [$\circ$ shall be commutative] $
(a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ b \circ c = b \circ a \circ c = b \circ c \circ a = (b \circ c) \circ a.

So, I go away, look at Wikipedia, find out about Bessel's correction, slowly work my way through the maths and eventually learn to accept that, since $\bar x$ is calculated from the data, I only have $99$ independent comparisons of $x-\bar x$. This makes a kind of sense. If I only have $1$ observation, there are no other data to compare it with. If I have $2$ observations, I have exactly $1$ estimate of the spread of the data, which is the spread of the data, and so on.

A subset of the disjoint union $\coprod_\alpha X_\alpha$ is open if and only if its restriction to $X_\alpha$ (considered as a subset of the disjoint union) is open in $X_\alpha$. Proof: We want to show that $V$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha Y_\alpha$ if and only if $q^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha X_\alpha$. First $q$ is continuos since the restriction to $X_\alpha$ is a quotient map for each $\alpha$. So, if $V$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha Y_\alpha$ then $q^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha X_\alpha$. Now, suppose $q^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha X_\alpha$. Then $q^{-1}(V) \cap X_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. But $q^{-1}(V) \cap X_\alpha=q_\alpha^{-1}(V)$. So, $V$ is open in $Y_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. So, $V$ is open in $\coprod_\alpha Y_\alpha$. My concern is when I write $q^{-1}(V) \cap X_\alpha=q_\alpha^{-1}(V)$ because $q^{-1}(V) \cap X_\alpha \subset \coprod_\alpha X_\alpha$ whereas $q_\alpha^{-1}(V)\subset X_\alpha$ (as a standalone space, not as a subset of disjoint union).

2808055,Geometric intuition behind the proof of Frobenius' Theorem,"II am studying Frobenius' Theorem in Agricola & Friedrich's Global Analysis or, to be more precise, an auxiliary theorem that, roughly speaking, states that if $m-k$ $1$ -forms exist on a $m$ -dimensional manifold, and their derivatives can be written as: $$dw_i=\sum_{j=1}^{m-k}\theta_{ij}\wedge w_j$$ then the forms themselves can be expressed (locally) as: $$w_i=\sum_{j=1}^{m-k}h_{ij}\; df_j$$ for some functions $h_{ij},f_j$ . The proof proceeds in several steps that can be summarized by: Consider some coordinate system $(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^k\times\mathbb{R}^{m-k}$ such that the forms take the special structure: $$w_i=dz^i-\sum_{j=1}^k A_{ij}(y,z)\,dy^j$$ For each fixed $(u,v)\in\mathbb{R}^k\times\mathbb{R}^{m-k}$ , build the system of ODEs: $$\left(\gamma^i\right)'=\sum_{j=1}^k A_{ij}(t\,u,\gamma)\,u^j\quad ;\qquad\qquad \gamma^i(0)=v^i$$ If $F^i(t,u,v)=\gamma^i(t)$ is the solution of such system with parameters $u$ and initial values $v$ , consider the change of coordinates: $$\begin{aligned}
u^i&=y^i\\
F^j(1,u,v)&=z^j
\end{aligned}$$ Prove that when $w_i$ is expressed in the dual basis $\{du^1,\dots,du^k,dv^1,\dots,dv^{m-k}\}$ , the coefficients of the $du^i$ terms vanish, so that the functions $v^j$ are those required by the statement. Now, all the steps are more or less involved but, in the end, mechanical. But I am intrigued by the geometric intuition of the system of ODEs that appears at step 2. Does it mean that solution trajectories of the ODE remain on the integral manifold? It is not easy to see because, strictly speaking, the ODE is time-varying thus the solutions lie on a $m+1$ -dimensional space that includes time as an additional variable. So the title of the question could be rephrased as: how could Frobenius (and the other people in the history of the theorem) even think that the statement was true or figure out the proof procedure?

My strategy is: Suppose that there are positive numbers $a$ and $b$ each of whose square is $c$, then: $$0=a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$$ Since since $a+b$ is greater than $0$, it follows that $a=b$. q.e.d.

My guess would be that they are mutually singular for all $f$, and that it shold not be too hard to find example sets on which each of them takes $0$ values while the other assigns positive measure, however I have not practiced measure theory for a while, so can't think of anything simple. Question: I would like to know whether $\mu_2$ and $\nu_2$ are indeed mutually singular for any $f$ as above.",['measure-theory']
2808626,Condition that the faces of a graph be unique?,"There is a theorem that if a planar graph is 3-vertex-connected, then it has a unique embedding up to a reflection. (See e.g. here .) This means that its faces and its dual graph are uniquely defined. Is there a generalization of this result to graphs of higher genus (e.g. a graph that is not planar but can be embedded on the torus)?  Are there simple conditions that guarantee that the minimum-genus embedding is unique?","['graph-theory', 'general-topology', 'planar-graphs']"
2808675,Is determinant useful in representation of group,"I am learning representation theory of finite group, the trace of matrix is used to define character, which is very useful. the determinant of a matrix is also independent of choice of basis, is determinant of matrix useful in representation of group?","['representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
