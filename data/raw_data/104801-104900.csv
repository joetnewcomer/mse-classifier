1476585,Is there an algorithm for deciding big/little-O queries?,"Consider the following question: Is $2^{o(\log n)} = o(n^c)$ for every constant $0 < c < 1$? I can try to answer this question using basic limits to get that the answer is ""yes."" I can also put a query of the following form into Wolfram alpha: What is $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{\log^{0.999}n}}{n^{0.0001}}$? And it will spit out zero, while it fails to answer the first question because it apparently does not contain information about little-o notation or I don't know how to specify that this is what I want. My question is: given an input query of the above form, that is, two expressions composed as an elementary combination of elementary functions and Big/Little-O (or $\omega, \Omega, \Theta$), is the problem of answering such queries decidable? Is it in P? If so, could you provide a reference to the algorithm?

1476590,Confusion in symbol of subset.,"If every element of set $A$ is an element of set $B$ then we say that $A$ is subset of $B$ . $A$ is said to be proper subset if $A$ does not equal $B$ .
My question is -
whether the symbol we use to show subset is  same as that for proper subset? I have seen that $A$ is subset of $A$ itself is shown by the same symbol as that for the subset while when we write improper subset, we usually write equal to sign with symbol of subset.
So, please help me to know this.","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"

1476659,Are upper and lower Lebesgue integrals equal for every $f$?,"Is it true that lower and upper Lebesgue integrals are equal for every Lebesgue integrable function? If you look here you will see that: One nice feature of measurable functions is that the lower and upper
  Lebesgue integrals can match, if one also assumes some boundedness. Exercise 11 Let $f: {\bf R}^d \rightarrow [0,+\infty]$ be measurable,
  bounded, and vanishing outside of a set of finite measure. Show that
  the lower and upper Lebesgue integrals of $f$ agree. (Hint: use
  Exercise 4.) There is a converse to this statement, but we will defer
  it to later notes. What happens if $f$ is allowed to be unbounded, or
  is not supported inside a set of finite measure? So... what happens if $f$ is unbounded? Are upper and lower integrals equal? One person in the comments suggested it's true for unbounded functions as well (but he didn't provide a proof). Lebesgue defines area - then it's reasonable to expect that approximation of the area 'from above' and 'from below' should yield the same value (it's equivalent to saying that upper and lower Lebesgue integrals are equal - it would be nice if it was true). Based on the comments to my question, I'd say it depends on the definition of simple function - whether we want it to take finite valus, or countably many values. But, according on the definition in prof. Tao's article, what would be the correct answer to question raised in Exercise 11, quoted above? Apparently there are examples of Riemann integrable functions, whose upper Lebesgue integral doesn't equal (lower) Lebesgue integrals. But it's true that if both Riemann and Lebesgue integrals exist, they are equal.","['calculus', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

1476763,can radius and degree exist in the same angle,"I and my teacher had an argument about the result of $\sin(\pi-1)$. He said that to convert the angle from radius to degree you must replace every $\pi$ with 180 so he said that $\sin(\pi-1)=\sin(180-1)=\sin(179)$. but I think that $\pi$ is a value so $\pi-1$ must be evaluated first which $\simeq$ 2.14159

I am quite sure a complete characterisation will be very hard, but I'm looking for partial results as well. Clearly, if $P$ has one term, then $P$ has to have odd degree, since the degree of the right handed side is odd. The following example shows that in fact all such polynomials with positive coefficients work: We see that $Q(x)=\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{n}}x^n$ gives $Q'(x)=\sqrt{mn}x^{n-1}$ gives $ Q(x)Q'(x)=mx^{2n-1}$. If we require $Q$ to have real coefficients then this only works for $m>0$. We may also take $Q(x)=\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{n}}x^n+C$, this will give $P(x)=ax^{2n-1}+bx^{n-1}$ for all real $a>0$ and all real $b$. I conjecture this are the only two-term polynomials $P$ that statistify, because if we change $Q$, then the product $Q\cdot Q'$ will probably have too many terms.","['polynomials', 'calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'functional-equations']"
1476897,Some regular open sets of the Cantor space $2^\omega$ are not closed.,"The Cantor space is the set $2^\omega$ equipped with the product topology (where $2=\{0,1\}$ has the discrete topology). I'm encountering some difficulties in understanding this proof (splitted into a list by me): Proposition. Some regular open sets of $2^\omega$ are not closed. Proof. A counterexample is given by Odd and Even , where Odd (resp. Even ) is the set of sequences in $2^\omega$ that differ from $0^\omega$ and start with an odd (resp. even) number of zeros. These two sets are open, disjoint and their closures intersect only in $0^\omega$ . In particular, $0^\omega$ is the unique point in the closure of Odd and Even such that no open set containing it has a dense intersection with Odd or a dense intersection with Even . While any element of Odd (resp. Even ) has a clopen neighboorhood fully contained in Odd (resp. Even ). This means that Odd and Even are regular and open, but they are not closed. In particular, it seems that the proof makes use of some sort of ""intuitive understanding"" of how the Cantor space works, which I can't grasp. I know that open sets are basically the ones where only a finite number of ""entries"" are fixed, and that $2^\omega$ is compact, Hausdorff and $0$ -dimensional. But I don't understand: How do closures of sets in $2^\omega$ look like in general? And in particular, what are the closures of Odd and Even ? How do closed sets look like in $2^\omega$ ? How do clopen sets look like in $2^\omega$ ? Why is (1) interesting/needed for the rest of the proof? Why is (2) true? I understand why (3) is true and also why (4) follows by (3) (it's a characterization of regular open sets, even though we actually need just open neighborhoods, not clopen). Maybe everything becomes more clear if we look at $2^\omega$ as the metric space with the well-known metric?

Since $\mu$ is continuous  we have: $\mu(B_n)\to \mu(B)$ and $\mu(C_n)\to \mu(C)$ Let's suppose that $\mu(A)>0$. Since $\mu(A) = \mu(B) + \mu(C)$, we have two possibilities: a) $\mu(B)>0$ Since $\mu(B_n)\to \mu(B)$, there is an $k$ such that $\mu(B_{k}) \gt 0$. Thus  $$\int_{B_k} {f}\,{d\mu}  \geq \int_{B_k} {\frac{1}{k}}\,{d\mu} = 
\frac{\mu(B_k)}{k} \gt 0$$ which is a contradiction. b) $\mu(C)>0$ Since $\mu(C_n)\to \mu(C)$, there is an $k$ such that $\mu(C_{k}) \gt 0$. Thus  $$\int_{C_k} {(-f)}\,{d\mu}  \geq \int_{C_k} {\frac{1}{k}}\,{d\mu} = 
\frac{\mu(C_k)}{k} \gt 0$$ which is a contradiction. Thus $\mu(A)=0$. Am I right? Is there an easier way to solve this problem?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1477058,Closed periodic curve,"Let $\textbf{$\gamma$}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth curve and let  $T \in \mathbb{R}$. We say that $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is $T$-periodic if $$\textbf{$\gamma$}(t+T)=\textbf{$\gamma$}(t) \text{ for all } t \in \mathbb{R}.$$ 
If $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is not constant and is $T$-periodic for some $T\neq 0$, then $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is said to be closed. The period of a closed curve $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is the smallest positive number $T$ such that $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is $T$-periodic. A curve $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is said to have a self-intersection at a point $p$ of the curve if there exist parameter values $a\neq b$ such that $\textbf{$\gamma$}(a) = \textbf{$\gamma$}(b) = p$, and if $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is closed with period $T$, then $a-b$ is not an integer multiple of $T$. $$$$ $$$$ I am looking at the following exercise: Show that the Cayley sextic
$$\textbf{$\gamma$}(t) = \left (\cos^3t \cos {3t}, \cos^3t \sin {3t}\right ), t \in \mathbb{R}$$ 
is a closed curve which has exactly one self-intersection. What is its period? $$$$ I have done the following: Since $\textbf{$\gamma$} (0)=(1,0)$ and $\textbf{$\gamma$}\left  (\frac{\pi}{6}\right )=\left (0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right )$, i.e., $\textbf{$\gamma$} (0)\neq \textbf{$\gamma$} \left (\frac{\pi}{6}\right )$ we have that $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is not constant. We have that $$\cos (t+2\pi )=\cos t , \ \  \cos (3(t+2\pi ))=\cos (3t) ,  \ \ \sin (3(t+2\pi ))=\sin (3t)$$ 
so then $$\textbf{$\gamma$}(t+2\pi ) = \left ((\cos (t+2\pi ))^3 \cos {[3(t+2\pi )]}, (\cos (t+2\pi ))^3 \sin {[3(t+2\pi )]}\right )=\left (\cos^3t \cos {3t}, \cos^3t \sin {3t}\right )=\textbf{$\gamma$}(t), \forall t$$ That means that the non-constant curve $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is $2\pi$-periodic. So, $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is a closed curve. Is this correct? Is $2\pi$ the period? Is this the smallest positive number $T$ such that $\textbf{$\gamma$}$ is $T$-periodic? Or does the period change when we have $\cos 3t$ and $\sin 3t$ instead of $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ ? $$$$ EDIT: We have that $$\textbf{$\gamma$}\left  (\frac{\pi}{3}\right )=\left (-\frac{1}{8}, 0 \right ) \\ \textbf{$\gamma$}\left  (\frac{2\pi}{3}\right )=\left (-\frac{1}{8}, 0\right )$$ So, when we take $p=\left (-\frac{1}{8}, 0\right )$ we have that $\textbf{$\gamma$}\left  (\frac{\pi}{3}\right )=\textbf{$\gamma$}\left  (\frac{2\pi}{3}\right )=\left (-\frac{1}{8}, 0\right )$ Since the period is $\pi$, we have that $\frac{2\pi}{3}-\frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{1}{3}(\pi)$, i.e., $\frac{2\pi}{3}-\frac{\pi}{3}$ is not an integer multiple of the period. That means that $\gamma$ has a self-intersection at $p=\left (-\frac{1}{8}, 0\right )$. Now we want to show that this self-intersection is unique. To do that we want to find all points $x,y$ within one period of $[0,\pi]$ such that $\gamma(x)=\gamma(y)$. That is, find all solutions of the simultaneous system
$$
\begin{align*}
\cos^3(x) \cos(3x)&=\cos^3(y) \cos(3y) \\
\cos^3(x) \sin(3x)&=\cos^3(y) \sin(3y).
\end{align*}
$$ $$\frac{\cos^3(x) \cos(3x)}{\cos^3(x) \sin(3x)}=\frac{\cos^3(y) \cos(3y)}{\cos^3(y) \sin(3y)} \Rightarrow \frac{ \cos(3x)}{\sin(3x)}=\frac{ \cos(3y)}{ \sin(3y)} \\ \Rightarrow \cot (3x)=\cot (3y) \Rightarrow 3x=3y+k\pi \Rightarrow x=y+\frac{k}{3}\pi$$ Since the period is $\pi$, the only possible values for $k$ are $k=0$, $k=1$ and $k=2$. For $k=0$ we have $3x=3y \Rightarrow x=y$. But for $x=y$ the second condition of the definition of a self-intersection is not satisfied. So, for $k=1,2$ we have that $3x=3y+k\pi \Rightarrow x=y+\frac{k\pi}{3}$. The first condition of the definition is satisfied with each of these values. As for the second definition we want that $x-y=\frac{k\pi}{3}$ is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, which is also satisfied with each of these values for $k$. So we want somehow to show that the points that we get this relation are $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, or not? But how?

  least one odd integer is in its natural position. We have $5$ odd integers right, which is $1,3,5,7,9$ Now I think about it in terms of derangements. And so for example if we have  exactly one  odd integer in it's natural position then we have ${5 \choose 1}$ ways to choose this odd integer and we have $d(8)$ ways to derange the other integers right, so we have ${5 \choose 1} d(8)$ Now if we have two odd integers in their natural position so we have ${5 \choose 2} d(7)$ and so on so my answer will be the following $${5 \choose 1}d(8) + {5 \choose 2}d(7) + {5 \choose 3}d(6) + {5 \choose 4} d(5) + {5 \choose 5}d(4)$$ and this will gives the total number of ways that we have at least one integer in it's natural position. Is that true !! But the problem is, we don't necessarily want to derange all other integers so I guess my answer will fail. What do you think guys ? I also thought about deranging the odd integers and permuting the even integers so I thought maybe we will have something like the following: If we have exactly one integer in it's natural position so I have to derange the other $4$ odd integers and permute the even integers so I will have $${5 \choose 1} d(4) 4!$$ and in the case where I have exactly two odd integers in their natural position so I have to derange the other 3 odd integers and still I have to permute the 4 even integers so I will have $${5 \choose 2} d(3) 4!$$
and so on
And so my answer in this case will be $${5 \choose 1}d(4)4! + {5 \choose 2}d(3)4! + {5 \choose 3}d(2)4! + {5 \choose 4} d(1)4! + {5 \choose 5}d(0)4!$$ Is any of these answers true ?

$$\partial_x q(x) = -ikq(x)\partial_x |x|$$
$$\partial_x^2 q(x) = -k^2q(x)(\partial_x |x|)^2 -ikq(x)\partial^2_x|x|$$

1477251,(Exponential) Growth of Operator Norm of Uncentered Maximal Function,"Define the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M$ by
$$Mf(x):=\sup_{x\in B}\dfrac{1}{\left|B\right|}\int_{B}\left|f\right|,$$
where we the supremum is taken over all (open) balls $B$ containing the point $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $f_{0}$ denote the characteristic function of the unit ball. I am trying to show that for $1<p<\infty$, $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\dfrac{\left\|Mf_{0}\right\|_{L^{p}}}{\left\|f_{0}\right\|_{L^{p}}}=\infty
> \tag{1}$$ by following the suggestion in Exercise 2.1.8 of L. Grafakos, Classical Fourier Analysis (Third Edition). Actually, I would like to show that the growth of the $L^{p}\rightarrow L^{p}$ is exponential in the dimension $n$, but I'll settle for the above. Let $B_{0}$ denote the unit ball, and for $\left|x\right|>1$, let $B_{x}$ be the ball with center $c$ and radius $r$ given by
$$c=\dfrac{(\left|x\right|-\left|x\right|^{-1})}{2}\dfrac{x}{\left|x\right|},\quad r=\dfrac{(\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1})}{2}$$ Observe that $x\in B_{x}$, so 
$$Mf(x)\geq\dfrac{1}{\left|B_{x}\right|}\int_{B_{x}}\left|f_{0}\right|=\dfrac{2^{n}}{(\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1})^{n}\left|B_{0}\right|}\left|B_{x}\cap B_{0}\right|$$
Since
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{4}\left(\left|x\right|-\left|x\right|^{-1}\right)^{2}+1&=\dfrac{\left|x\right|^{2}}{4}+\dfrac{\left|x\right|^{-2}}{4}+\dfrac{1}{2}=\left(\dfrac{\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1}}{2}\right)^{2},
\end{align*}
we see that $B_{x}\cap B_{0}$ contains $B_{x}\cap B_{0}$ contains a ""half-ball"" of $B_{1}(0)$and a hyperspherical cap of height $\left|x\right|^{-1}$ and radius $(\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1})/2$, which we denote by $C_{x}$. In particular,
$$\left|B_{x}\cap B_{0}\right|\geq\dfrac{1}{2}\left|B_{0}\right|+\left|C_{x}\right|$$
My initial thought was to simplify things and ignore the term $\left|C_{x}\right|$ to get the lower bound
$$Mf(x)\geq\dfrac{2^{n-1}}{(\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1})^{n}},\quad\forall \left|x\right|>1$$
Thus,
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{\left\|Mf\right\|_{L^{p}}}{\left\|f_{0}\right\|_{L^{p}}}&\geq\dfrac{2^{n-1}}{(n^{-1}\omega_{n-1})^{1/p}}\left(\int_{\left|x\right|>1}\dfrac{1}{(\left|x\right|+\left|x\right|^{-1})^{np}}dx\right)^{1/p}\\
&=\dfrac{2^{n-1}}{(n^{-1}\omega_{n-1})^{1/p}}\left(\int_{1}^{\infty}\dfrac{r^{n-1}}{(r+r^{-1})^{np}}dr\int_{S^{n-1}}d\theta dr\right)^{1/p}\\
&=2^{n-1}n^{1/p}\left(\int_{1}^{\infty}\dfrac{r^{n-1}}{(r+r^{-1})^{np}}dr\right)^{1/p}

Using the definition of continuity involving convergent sequences, for $x_0\in \mathbb{R}$, I take any sequence $\lbrace x_n \rbrace$ such that $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Then I need to prove that $F(x_n)\rightarrow F(x)$, i.e., $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_a^{x_n}f(t)\mathrm{d}t=\int_a^xf(t)\mathrm{d}t$$ I know that, if $m$ is the Lebesgue measure, then

Thanks :) Let $B$ be the set of rational numbers in the interval $[0,1]$ Let $I_{k}$ , $k=1,2,\cdots, n$ be a finite collection of open intervals that covers $B$ .  Prove that $\sum_{k=1}^{n}l(I_{k})\geq 1$ . ( $l(I)$ denotes the length of the interval $I$ ). $\underline{\mathbf{\text{Proof}}}$ : Suppose $a,b \in [0,1]$ such that $a < b$ . By the density of the rational numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ , $\exists q_{i} \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall a_{i} < b_{i}$ , $q_{i}\in(a_{i},b_{i})$ . Since the rationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and hence in $[0,1]$ , we can cover $[0,1]$ as follows: $[0,1] \subseteq \cup_{k=1}^{\infty}I_{k}=\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_{k},b_{k}) $ . (In the case where the $(a_{k},b_{k})$ do not completely cover $[0,1]$ completely, $\exists$ a point between $(a_{i},b_{i})$ and $(a_{i+1}, b_{i+1})$ that remains uncovered.  However, because there are countably many intervals, there will be only countably many such points.  Thus, the set of points, call it $S$ , being a countable set will have $m^{*}(S)=0$ .  So, these points will be negligible in terms of their effect on the sum of the lengths of the intervals.) By Heine-Borel, since $[0,1]$ is closed and bounded, every such open cover has a finite subcover. So, $[0,1] \subset \cup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k},b_{k}) = \cup_{k=1}^{n}I_{k}$ . Now, the outer measure of an interval is its length.  So $m^{*}([0,1])=l([0,1]) = 1$ , and by the definition of the outer measure, $1 = m^{*}([0,1]) = \inf_{k=1}^{n}l(I_{k}) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n}l(I_{k})$ Q.E.D.

1477616,Tarski-like axiomatization of spherical or elliptic geometry,"Preamble Tarski's axioms formalize Euclidean geometry in a first-order theory where the variables range over the points of the space and the primitive notions are betweenness $Bxyz$ (meaning $y$ is on the line segment between $x$ and $z$, inclusive) and congruence $xy\equiv zw$ (meaning the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is the same length as the line segment between $z$ and $w$). One of the features of this system that I like is that it is somewhat modular; the axioms of upper and lower dimension can be chosen independently of the other axioms to fix the dimension of the space, and, notably, the axiom of Euclid can be simply replaced by it's negation to change it into an axiomatization of hyperbolic geometry. The question It is very easy to adapt Tarski's axioms of Euclidean geometry to axioms of hyperbolic geometry. I am wondering if something similar can be done for spherical and elliptic geometry. From what I can tell, the answer is yes, but the betweenness and congruence relations have to be changed because of the different topology of spherical and elliptic geometry, compared to Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. Some more details Specifically, the relations in Tarski's axioms indirectly rely on the fact that two points uniquely define a line segment in Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry, but this is not the case in spherical and elliptic geometries. Generally, two points will define two line segments, one going around the sphere the short way, and the other the long way. (In elliptic geometry, the line which is made up of these two line segments is still unique even when the points are maximally distant. In spherical geometry the problem is worse as the line is not uniquely defined when the points are antipodal.) So I think that the betweenness relation would have to be modified to a relation meaning something like ""$x$ is on the line segment that goes from $y$ to $z$ through $w$"", and the congruence relation would have to be modified to something meaning ""the line segment from $x$ to $y$ through $z$ has the same length as the line segment from $u$ to $v$ through $w$"" - every line segment specification requires an additional point of information. But I am having difficulty figuring out how the behaviour of these new relations would be axiomatized. (And they very well might be different between spherical and elliptic.) Does anyone have any ideas? Once the basic properties of these relations were axiomatized, I do not think it would be too difficult to translate the various geometrical axioms of Tarski's system (segment construction, Pasch's axiom, five-segment axiom, dimension axioms, and an axiom making the space curved). But the trick is getting the primitive relations to work correctly. Thanks!","['noneuclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'axioms']"
1477638,NBA Draft Pick for Worst Team Probability,"This is actually a question from ""A First Course in Probability"" by Sheldon Ross, and I have the solution, but am unclear as to why the solution is the case. Would anyone please clarify? The question is as follows: 11 teams are entered into the NBA draft lottery. A total of 66 balls
  are placed in an urn, with the worst team having 11 balls placed, the
  second worst team having 10 balls placed, etc (with 1 ball having the
  name of the team with the eleventh worst record). A ball is chosen at
  random and the team whose name is on the ball is given the first pick
  in the draft. Another ball is chosen, and if that ball is different
  from the first pick team, that team becomes the second pick team. If
  the ball is the same, the ball is discarded and the drawing continues.
  This goes on for the first three draft pick teams. After the first three draft pick teams are chosen, the rest of the
  teams that did not win the lottery invert their win-loss records and
  that order is awarded for draft picks 4 through 11. For example, if
  the team with the worst record didn't receive any of the 3 lottery
  picks, it becomes the 4th pick. Let X denote the draft pick of the team with the worst record. Find
  the probability mass function of X. For P(X = 1), the answer is simply $\frac{11}{16}$. However, for $P(X = 2)$, the solution in the book is $$\sum\limits_{j=2}^{11} \bigl( \frac{12-j}{66} \bigr)\bigl( \frac{11}{54+j} \bigr)$$. This solution doesn't make sense to me, because it doesn't account for the repeated drawing of the same first draft pick team. For example, if the team with 10 balls gets the first draft pick, the second draft pick team would be decided from another draw. If the first pick team is drawn again, that ball is discarded and the process is repeated. So shouldn't the solution account for when, for example, the first draft pick is the second worst team, the second and up to tenth draws are still the second worst team, and the 11th draw (still choosing the 2nd draft pick) is the worst team?

This didn't seem to me like a natural question to ask, since the exponential distribution has nice properties with respect to addition and not so much with respect to multiplication, and the discriminant condition $b^2\ge4ac$ is multiplicative; so I was a bit surprised by the simple answer $\frac13$. This seems to cry out for a symmetric proof, e. g. using a transformation to three equivalent variables one of which must equiprobably be the greatest to fulfill the condition. However, I couldn't come up with such a transformation (I tried $\sqrt{ab}$, $\sqrt{bc}$, $\sqrt{ca}$ and $a-b$, $b-c$, $c-a$) and could only obtain the probability by performing an asymmetric and somewhat involved triple integration.

1477788,Classifying Diophantine Equations,"Take a given Diophantine equation. Chances are, we can't find any solutions. But if it's an equation of a certain form, we may get lucky and may be able not only to find a solution, but be able to classify all the solutions of such an equation. I'm preparing a talk on Diophantine Equations. I'm interested in exploring how the difficulty of Diophantine equations increase as both the number of variables and the degree of the equation increases. Of course, due to Matiyasevich's resolution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem, we know that no general algorithm to determine whether or not a given Diophantine Equation has a solution. Here's my current understanding of the ""frontier"" of Diophantine Equations: Variables $=1$, Degree $=n$: The solutions are completely determined by the Rational Root Theorem. Once you have all the rational roots, just look for the roots that are also integers. Variables $=k$, Degree $=1$: The equation is of the form $$a_1 x_1 + ... + a_k x_k = d.$$ This has solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor of $a_1,...,a_k$ divides $d$, and in that case, we have a nice formula parametrising the solutions (which I won't repeat here). Variables $=2$, Degree $=2$: There exist solutions to an equation $P(x,y)$ if and only if we have: 1) There exist solutions to $P(x,y) \mod n$ for all integers $n$ (so in practise, you just need to verify there exists solutions $\mod p$ for all primes $p$, and then by Hensel's Lemma, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have solutions for all $n$. 2) There exist real solutions to $P(x,y)$ If we can find one solution, we can find all rational solutions through stereographic projection. Once you have all rational solutions, look at the solutions where the denominator divides the numerator to get all the integer solutions. Variables $=2$, Degree $=3$: This is handled by elliptic curves. Broadly speaking, provided that the equation is ""nice enough"", the set of solutions to the Diophantine equation has an abelian group structure. This consists of a torsion free part, which can be one of 16 possible groups, and a torsion free part, which looks like $\mathbb{Z}^r$ for some natural number $r$. The $r$ here is called the rank of an elliptic curve, and computing it is, in general, computationally difficult. Variables $\geq 2$, Degree $\geq 4$: In general, this is no man's land. Of course, some equations we may have luck with (take $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$; there is an elementary proof that this has no solutions in the natural numbers), but in general, you're probably out of luck. The other two types of Diophantine equations that I haven't spoken about are exponential Diophantine equations (such as Catalan's conjecture: $x^a - y^b =1$ only has one solutions, namely $x=3, a = 2, y=2, b=3$), and infinite Diophantine equations. These are even more intractable, so I won't touch on these at all. My question is, in my above analysis, have I missed out anything obvious/is there anything glaringly wrong?","['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"
1477807,Projective resolutions of modules in a short exact sequence (Dummit & Foote Proposition 17.1.7),"This proposition is as follows: Let
$$
0\rightarrow L\rightarrow M\rightarrow N\rightarrow 0
$$
be a short exact sequence of R-modules. Let the following be projective resolutions of L and N respectively:
$$
\cdots\rightarrow P_{1}\rightarrow P_{0}\rightarrow L\rightarrow 0
$$
$$
\cdots\rightarrow \bar{P}_{1}\rightarrow \bar{P}_{0}\rightarrow N\rightarrow 0
$$
The proposition claims that there is a projective resolution for M:
$$
\cdots\rightarrow P_{1}\oplus\bar{P}_{1}\rightarrow P_{0}\oplus\bar{P}_{0}\rightarrow M\rightarrow 0
$$
that commutes with all the above exact sequences, as well as the obvious ones given by
$$
0\rightarrow P_n\rightarrow P_n\oplus\bar{P}_{n}\rightarrow\bar{P}_{n}\rightarrow 0
$$ The book constructs the maps in the projective resolution for M as follows: 
For the first map, first lift the map $\bar{P}_{0}\rightarrow N$ to $\Phi:\bar{P}_{0}\rightarrow M$ (this is possible because $M\rightarrow N\rightarrow 0$ is surjective and $\bar{P}_{0}$ is projective). Then, compose $P_{0}\rightarrow L$ and $L\rightarrow M$ to get a map $\psi:P_{0}\rightarrow M$, and define $\phi:P_{0}\oplus \bar{P}_{0}\rightarrow M$ as follows:
$$
\phi(a,b)=\psi(a)+\Phi(b)
$$
It is not hard to see that this makes the diagram commute. However, my problem is that I cannot see how the sequence given by the maps is exact at $P_{0}\oplus \bar{P}_{0}$. I want to prove that if $\phi(a,b)\in ker(\phi)$, then $\phi(a,b)\in im(\alpha)$ where $\alpha:P_{1}\oplus \bar{P}_{1}\rightarrow P_{0}\oplus \bar{P}_{0}$. That means I need $\psi(a)$ to be zero so that $a$ is in the image of $P_{1}\rightarrow P_{0}$. However, there does not seem to be any reason for this to be true. In particular, I have the following seeming counterexample. Suppose the initial exact sequence was 
$$
0\rightarrow n\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow 0
$$
and the projective resolutions are:
$$
\cdots\rightarrow 0\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{n}n\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow 0
$$
$$
\cdots\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\alpha}\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\phi}\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow 0
$$
$$
\cdots\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{n}\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{n\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow 0
$$
Then we have 
$$
\phi(a,b)=an+b
$$
$$
\alpha(c)=(0,nc)
$$
by commutativity of the whole diagram (which unfortunately I do not know how to draw). However, $(-1,n)\in ker(\phi)$ but $(-1,n)\not\in im(\alpha)$. This seems to contradict exactness. It would be great if someone could point out the flaws in my argument. Thanks very much in advance!","['abstract-algebra', 'projective-module', 'homological-algebra']"

The minimum exists since $O(n)$ is compact) Note: In general we don't always have a unique minimizer (i.e there can be more than one orthogonal matrice which is closest to $A$ in $o(n)$), at least if we consider non-invertible matrices $A$. For example, $A=0$ is in the same distance from each element of $o(n)$ since the Frobenius norm of any isometry is $\sqrt n$.

where $H_n^{(m)}$ is the generalized harmonic number , and $|z|<1$, $m \in \mathbb{R}$. Using the generating function of the generalized harmonic numbers, an equivalent problem is to evaluate the following integral:
$$
\mathcal{S}_m(z) = \int_0^z \frac{\operatorname{Li}_m(t)}{t(1-t)}\,dt,
$$
where $\operatorname{Li}_m(t)$ is the polylogarithm function , and $|z|<1$, $m \in \mathbb{R}$. Question 1 : Are there any way to reduce the sum to Euler sum values, given by Flajolet–Salvy paper ? Question 2 : Are there any way to reduce the integral to integrals given by Freitas paper ? The case $m=1$ and $z=1/2$ was the problem 1240 in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 60, No. 2, pp. 118–119.

There are several solutions in the linked paper. The more interesting case $m=2$ and $z=1/2$ is listed at Harmonic Number, MathWorld , eq. $(41)$:
$$
\mathcal{S}_2\left(\tfrac12\right)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n2^n} = \frac{5}{8}\zeta(3).
$$ We know less about the evaluation. At the MathWorld it is marked as ""B. Cloitre (pers. comm., Oct. 4, 2004)"". This value is also listed at pi314.net , eq. $(701)$. Unfortunately, I don't know about any paper/book reference for this value. It would be nice to see some. Question 3 : How could we evaluate the case $m=2$, $z=1/2$?

1478028,Completion of a metric space $\mathbb{R}$ with a special metric,"Let $(\mathbb{R},d)$ be a metric space. Define $d(x,y) = |\tan^{-1} x - \tan^{-1} y|$.
I want to prove that $(\mathbb{R},d)$ is isometric to $(\{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\}, \rho)$ where $\rho$ is a Euclidean distance.
Define $f: (\mathbb{R},d) \to (\{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\}, \rho), f(x) = \tan^{-1} x$. Obviously, the function is a bijection, and it preserves metric: $d(x,y) = |\tan^{-1} x - \tan^{-1} y| = \rho(f(x),f(y))$. So the metric spaces are isometric. We know that $(\{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\}, \rho)$ is incomplete, since the sequence $x_n = \tan^{-1} n$ is Cauchy, but it converges to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $(\mathbb{R},\rho)$, since 
$\frac{\pi}{2} \notin \{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\}$, it is incomplete.
So since spaces are isometric, $(\mathbb{R},d)$ is also incomplete. I assume the completion of $(\{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\}, \rho)$ will be $(\{\tan^{-1} x, x \in \mathbb{R}\} \cup \{-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\}, \rho)$.

However, I notice that we can approximate the surface area of a sphere by imaging 'the shell' of the sphere as the difference between two similarly sized spheres with width infinitely small. What I mean is that if we have two spheres, one of radius $r$ and another of radius $r+h$, where $h$ is very small, the surface area can be roughly measured by the difference in volume of these two spheres divided by its width $h$. Therefore if $f(r)$ is the volume of a sphere with radius $r$, then the surface area should be $$\lim_{h\to0} \dfrac{f(r+h)-f(r)}{h}$$but this is exactly the derivative $f'(r)$ of the volume. Hence we can say that the surface area of a sphere is $4\pi r^2$. Is this proof even correct? Is it rigorous? How do I improve it and make it more convincing? I noticed how this should similarly work for other objects, for example, the derivative of the area of a circle is its perimeter. Does this phenomenon likewise extend to other examples?

1478166,Disjoint union topology vs Product topology,"I am trying to understand the differens between the two more precisely. I am aware that the product topology is the product in category while the disjoint union topology is the coproduct. Unfortunately I feel that doesn't quite explain it. If we let $(\mathbf{A},\alpha)$ and $(\mathbf{B},\beta)$ be two given topologies. I understand that our product topology for $\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}$ is that a set $(u,v)$ is open in it if and only if $u$ is open in $\mathbf{A}$ and $v$ is open in $\mathbf{B}$. So far so good, this is all crystal clear to me. I will use the $\oplus$ symbol rather than the upside-down product sign, I don't like it. Let our disjoint union $\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$, a set for us here is then $u\oplus v$ and this is where I am starting to feel uncertain. I get there is a very evident inclusion map $\imath_A:\mathbf{A}\to\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ which would be $\imath_A(a)=a\oplus\emptyset$, or more I deduce this from the context of what I am reading that this is the most likely candidate. I also gather from what I have read (I will inform I have not found it in a proper book in my studies so far, might have missed it but I have read this primarely online from definitions) that a set $u\oplus v$ is open if and only if $\imath_A^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ and $\imath_B^{-1}(u\oplus v)$ are open. This doesn't strike me as really that different, or different at all, from the product topology at first sight. I will speculate a bit here so please tell me what I get right and what I get wrong. I know the product topology is the cartesian product hence no part of the pair $(a,b)$ can be empty, the empty set is of course always part in the topology by definition. What I gather from my reading though is that they often place emphasis on the word ""or"", as in for $w\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ we have that either $w\in\mathbf{A}$ OR $w\in\mathbf{B}$. This leads me to conclude that if we have $a\oplus b\in\mathbf{A}\oplus\mathbf{B}$ then either $a=\emptyset$ or we have that $b=\emptyset$. In a more word friendly way, that any element in our disjoint union topology is a member of either of the components that makes up the union, and not a construct as a combination from both of the components, which it is in a proudct topology. Am I understanding this correctly or am I missing something?",['general-topology']
1478206,Number of circular seating arrangements if each person can't sit next to two other people,"There are 30 people sitting around a round table, and those 30 people all arrived to the event in 10 groups of 3. How many different ways can those people sit around the table if no-one is allowed to sit next to anyone else who arrived with them (ie was with them in a triplet, so for each person there are two other people they are not allowed to be seated next to). Hope that explanation makes sense! I am really stumped with this question, completely lost and no idea where to start. My train of thought was as follows, however: If you seat the first person down, then there are 29 people yet to be seated. Additionally, there are 2 people you can't sit in the next seat, adjacent to the first person you sat. So there are 27 people who can be seated in the second seat. Then in the third, there are 28 people remaining, as two have been seated. Again, two people can't sit there, for there are 26 people who can sit in the third chair. Now, if my thinking is even correct up to this point, things start to get particularly foggy in my mind. So 27 people remain, and a maximum of two people may not be able to sit in the seat next to the third person. So it seems reasonable to suggest that 25 people can sit there. But if one of those two people has already sat earlier, then actually there are actually 26 of the remaining 27 who are allowed to sit in this seat. It is here that I am finding myself at a complete loss. It occurred to me that I could calculate the total possible number of seating arrangements without conditions, and then subtract the arrangements where the given condition is broken....but that would be a lot of different illegitimate conditions to calculate.

(In this case, the question is under which conditions continuous negative definite functions have such holomorphic extensions.) Motivation: The characteristic function of a symmetric $\alpha$ -stable random variable equals $e^{- c|\xi|^{\alpha}}$ . It is obvious that this function does not admit a holomorphic extension to a strip containing $0$ , but it has a holomorphic extension to the (interior) of $\mathbb{C}\backslash (i \mathbb{R} \backslash \{0\}$ . There are quite a few examples where similar things happen (because of missing regularity we cannot expect a holomorphic extension to a neighborhood of $0$ , but away from $0$ it's fine). There is a result (due to Cuppens and Lukacs ) stating that for any open subset $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ which is symmetric with respect to to the imaginary axis and whose closure contains $ia$ and $-ib$ for some $a,b > 0$ , there exists a characteristic function $\chi$ which cannot extended (analytically) beyond $\Omega$ . That means that we cannot expect, in general, that ""nice"" holomorphic extensions exist.
