4452858,Hausdorff dimension of sets with positive Lebesgue measure,"I am reading Hausdorff Dimension, Its Properties, and Its Surprises by Dierk Schleicher. Among the elementary properties of the Hausdorff dimension, the last one is: If $X\subset \Bbb R^n$ has finite positive $d$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure, then $\dim_H X = d$ . My work. It will be enough to show that $\mathcal H^s(X) = 0$ for all $s > d$ , and $\mathcal H^s(X) = \infty$ for all $s < d$ . As usual, $$H^s(X) = \lim_{\delta\to 0} H^s_\delta(X)$$ where $$\mathcal H^s_\delta(X) = \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s: \{U_i\} \text{ is a }\delta\text{-cover of }X  \right\}$$ I'm unable to relate the Lebesgue measure with coverings of $X$ , which would help me find a connection with $\mathcal H^s_\delta(X)$ for given $\delta > 0$ .

4452869,Pseudo-periodicity of analytic self-maps of the upper half-plane,"I have a couple of questions, in increasing order of softness: Consider an analytic map of the upper-half plane into itself $f: \mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{H}$ . When this function is $1$ -periodic, i.e., $f(z+1) = f(z)$ , then one can expand $f$ into a Fourier series (sometimes called the $q$ -expansion in this context). I'm interested in functions that have a ""pseudo-periodicity"" property, say, $f(z+3)=f(z)+1$ . Is there anything that can be said about the form $f$ must take in this case? More generally, I am interested in analytic maps $f: \mathbb{H}\to\mathbb{H}$ which satisfy a ""pseudo-equivariance"" (is there a better name for this?) condition: given a finite index subgroup $H<{\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ , there is some virtual endomorphism* $\phi: H\to G$ such that $$f(g.z) = \phi(g).f(z)$$ for every $g\in H$ . Basically this will correspond to a set of functional equations that $f$ must satisfy. My general hope is that if one is given sufficiently many of these functional equations, then the map $f$ will be more or less determined. My reasoning is that if one can determine the fundamental domain of $f$ under the action of $H$ , and also determine the image of this domain, then it should be possible to determine the map everywhere else as well. The theory of modular forms seemed like a good starting place for results along these lines, but the transformation condition for modular forms is quite different and I don't think there's a neat trick to transfer my problem into the modular form setting. Does anyone know any theories/papers which might be relevant here? I feel like problems of this sort have probably been studied before, but my google skills are failing me. *A virtual endomorphism of a group $G$ is a homomorphism from a subgroup of finite index $H \leq G$ into $G$ .","['functional-equations', 'reference-request', 'complex-analysis', 'modular-forms', 'soft-question']"
4452873,Periodic sequences of integers generated by $a_{n+1}=\operatorname{rad}(a_{n})+\operatorname{rad}(a_{n-1})$,"Let's define the radical of the positive integer $n$ as $$\operatorname{rad}(n)=\prod_{\substack{p\mid n\\ p\text{ prime}}}p$$ and consider the following Fibonacci-like sequence $$a_{n+1}=\operatorname{rad}(a_{n})+\operatorname{rad}(a_{n-1})$$ If $a_1=1,\,a_2=1$ the sequence coincides with OEIS A121369 $$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10, 13, 23, 36, 29, 35, 64, 37, 39, 76, 77, ...$$ If $a_1=2,\,a_2=2$ the sequence becomes $$2, 2, 4, 4, 4, ...$$ If $a_1=3,\,a_2=3$ the sequence becomes $$3, 3, 6, 9, 9, 6, 9, ...$$ If $a_1=5,\,a_2=5$ the sequence becomes $$5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 20, 15, 25, ...$$ If $a_1=7,\,a_2=7$ the sequence becomes $$7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56, 49, 21, 28, 35, 49, 42, 49, 49, 14, 21, ...$$ The above sequences, except for the first, are all periodic.

4452883,Tail bounds for sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential distributions,"Massart and Laurent (see [ 1 ], Lemma 1 on page 1325] give tail bounds for $\chi^2$ random variables.

I couldn't find any equivalent for the first one (""lower tail""). Furthermore, I couldn't find any inequalities for sub-exponential RV without any additional prerequisites (e.g., maximum known).

4452923,Convergence of measures on a compact metric space,"In the paper ""Ergodic optimization"" by Oliver Jenkinson, Proposition 2.1 says (among other things): Let $T:X\to X$ be a continuous map on a compact metric space. If $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is either continuous, or the characteristic function of a closed subset, then $$\sup_{\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{T}}\int fd\mu =
 \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sup_{x\in X}S_{n}f(x).$$ Here $\mathcal{M}_{T}$ is the collection of Borel probability measures invariant under $T$ in $X$ , and $S_{n}f := \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\circ T^{i}$ . I want to prove that $$\sup_{\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{T}}\int fd\mu  \geq \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sup_{x\in X}S_{n}f(x)$$ to understand the proof. My doubt is: Why do you have an accumulation point $\mu$ with respect to the weak- $\ast$ topology? Is it some usual property of compact metric spaces? If you could give me some reference to read about it I would appreciate it very much? The proof in the paper: Compactness of $X$ means that the set $\mathcal{M}$ of Borel probability measures on $X$ is compact with respect to the weak- $\ast$ topology. If $$\mu_{n} := \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\delta_{T^{i}x_{n}},$$ where $x_{n}$ is such that $$\max_{x\in X}\frac{1}{n}S_{n}f(x) = \frac{1}{n}S_{n}f(x_{n}) = \int fd\mu_{n},$$ then the sequence $(\mu_{n})$ has a weak- $\ast$ accumulation point $\mu$ . It is easy to see that in fact $\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{T}$ . Without loss of generality we shall suppose that $\mu_{n}\to\mu$ in the weak- $\ast$ topology. If $f$ is continuous, this means that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int fd\mu_{n} = \int fd\mu \leq \sup_{\mu\in\mathcal{M}}\int fd\mu.$$","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'probability']"
4452940,"Easier way to solve equation systems of $a+b+c+\cdots{}= 1$, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2+\cdots{}=2$ and so on without having to crunch massive expressions","I study at below college level. I have been trying to solve certain systems of equations involving $n$ equations of $n$ unknowns. For example, for $2$ unknowns, the problem is \begin{align} 
a^{\phantom{1}} + b^{\phantom{1}} &= 1 \\ 
a^2 + b^2 &= 2 \\ 
a^3 + b^3 &={} ?
\end{align} This can be solved with elementary algebra and/or WolframAlpha. You can generalize this to more unknowns: \begin{align} 
a^{\phantom{1}} + b^{\phantom{1}} + c^{\phantom{1}} &= 1 \\ 
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= 2 \\ 
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 &= 3 \\ 
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 &={} ? 
\end{align} with the same restraint: $n$ unknowns, $n$ equations, in each equation the powers of each variable is the same, and the pattern is clear. Now, I, off of only the first $3$ cases (including the trivial case $a = 1$ , find $a^2$ ) made a conjecture about the result (the missing value of the final expression). Since this is such a random guess at the value, and so many functions could meet just the first few data points, I want to solve the version with $4$ unknowns, just to see whether the conjecture's true. However, this is very difficult. The expansions quickly get out of hand and not even WolframAlpha can do it. I want a way to at least get the solving process under control. Usually, one'd generate equations and use those to solve for things like $a \cdot b^3$ , but here the issue is that just setting up the equations is a task too difficult. Is there a way to elegantly solve the system? I don't mind trading in time for maybe some more difficult math.","['algebra-precalculus', 'systems-of-equations', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'polynomials']"

4453011,Fisher-Neyman Factorisation Theorem and sufficient statistic misunderstanding,"Fisher Neyman Factorisation Theorem states that for a statistical model for $X$ with PDF / PMF $f_{\theta}$ , then $T(X)$ is a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ if and only if there exists nonnegative functions $g_{\theta}$ and $h(x)$ such that for all $x,\theta$ we have that $f_{\theta}(x)=g_{\theta}(T(x))(h(x))$ . Computationally, this makes sense to me. However, recently I have started to have some doubts about when and where I can apply this theorem. For example, if I have the PDF for a uniform distribution $f_{\theta}(x)=\frac{1}{\theta}$ , doesn't this allow me to make any sufficient statistic that I like by rewriting the PDF as $$f_{\theta}(x)=\Big(\frac{X^2+X^4}{\theta}\Big)\Big(\frac{1}{X^2+X^4}\Big)$$ which would make our sufficient statistic $T(X)=X^2+X^4$ . Or if we replace this particular choice of $T(X)$ for something else, doesn't this allow us to construct almost any choice of $T(X)$ as a valid sufficient statistic?

4453070,"""Multiply everything so far, plug into polynomial"" - can these always yield primes?","EDIT: I forgot how open number theory is! (I think that gets me put on mathematician probation or something.) For this question, I will accept any answer which assumes ""standard conjectures"" such as RH, Schanuel, Bunyakovsky, etc. I'm definitely more optimistic about conditional results. Say that a factonomial sequence is a (possibly infinite) sequence of natural numbers $x_i$ such that each $x_i$ is prime, and there is some (single variable, integer coefficients, nonconstant) polynomial $p$ such that for all $i>1$ we have $$x_i=p(\prod_{j<i}x_j).$$ Call the polynomial $p$ the shape of the factonomial sequence; each factonomial sequence is determined by its shape and its initial value. The basic idea is that factonomial sequences come out of some elementary proofs that infinitely many primes of a certain form exist. For instance, the usual ""multiply everything and add one"" argument gives rise to the shape $p_1(u)=u+1$ , and the usual ""multiply everything twice and add two"" proof that there are infinitely many primes $\equiv 3 (\mathsf{mod}$ $4)$ gives rise to the shape $p_2(u)=u^2+2$ . The maximal factonomial sequence with shape $p_2$ and starting value $3$ is $$3,11,1091, 1296216011, 2177870960662059587828905091.$$ The next term would be $$10329907495268194677701503661780370732730049826819138974714891651071966324541232011,$$ but that's not prime.

4453156,Why do we use exponentials while integrating trigonometric functions in complex analysis,"Let p(x) be some polynomial function. Now, we have an integral of the form : $$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(x)}{p(x)}dx$$ What is usually done is that, we define this integral as : $$I'=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{iz}}{p(z)}dz$$ Then we use the residue theorem, to integrate over the upper half of the complex plane. This gets separated into two integrals, over the curve and over the real axis. We can show that as $R\rightarrow\infty$ , the integral over the curve vanishes, and we are left with just the integral over the real axis. Then we use the fact that $\cos(x)$ is just the real part of $e^{ix}$ . So, comparing the real parts of the solution, we find the answer to our initial problem. My question is, why do we need to take $e^{iz}$ in the first place ? Is there some reason why we can't work with $\cos(x)$ directly? Moreover, depending on how we proceed, we can get different values of the residue. Consider the function $$f(z)=\frac{\cos(z)}{z^2}$$ Expanding using a taylor series, we can see, the $z^-1$ term doesn't exist, and so the residue is $0$ . Similarly, if I use the exponential, then I can use the following formula : $$Re(z=0)=\frac{1}{1!}\frac{d}{dz}(z-0)^2\frac{e^{iz}}{z^2}|_{z=0} = i$$ Hence, depending on what function I use, I'd get different values of the residue. The same thing happens for the function : $$f(z)=\frac{\cos(z)}{z^2}$$ I get the residue $\frac{\cosh(1)}{2i}$ or $\frac{1}{2ei}$ depending on whether I take the exponential or keep my cosine function. So, why do we replace trigonometric functions with complex exponentials in these problems ? I think this has something to do with the integral over the curve as $R\rightarrow\infty$ .

The statement is as follows: Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are two measurable partitions of a Lebesgue space $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ such that $\mathcal{A} \cap B$ is countable ( $\operatorname{mod}0$ with respect to $\mu_B$ ) for almost every $B \in \mathcal{B}$ . Then there exists a countable partition $\Gamma = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, ...\}$ of $X$ $(\operatorname{mod}0)$ such that each $\gamma_j \in \Gamma$ intersects almost every $B$ at not more than one point, which is then an atom of $\mu_B$ , in particular $$\mathcal{A} \vee \mathcal{B} = \Gamma \vee \mathcal{B} \,\,(\operatorname{mod}0).$$ My problem is I don't see how this theorem can be true, which leads me to believe I'm misunderstanding some other concepts. Can someone point out to me what is wrong with my ""counterexample"": Let $X$ be the unit interval. Take $\mathcal{A}$ to be some partition of $X$ into two sets and $\mathcal{B}$ to be the partition into $1$ element, the whole set $X$ . These are measurable partitions, of course $\mathcal{A} \cap B$ is countable (even finite), but how could there possibly be a partition $\Gamma$ from the statement? It would yield a partition of the unit interval into a countable set of points.

4453555,Multiplying by $1$ adds a solution to an equation,"I have a question, which is motivated by my book's solution to finding the inverse function of $f(x)=\frac{x}{1-x^2}$ with the domain of $f(x)$ restricted the open interval $(-1,1)$ . The questions are stated at the bottom, but first is the book's solution: Solution $f(x)$ is injective and surjective, and hence it has an inverse, $f^{-1}(x)$ . $y=\frac{x}{1-x^2}$ $x=\frac{y}{1-y^2}$ $xy^2+y-x=0$ $y=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4x^2}}{2x}$ The negative solution is the right one, and then the book notices that $y=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4x^2}}{2x}$ excludes $x=0$ from the domain, but it should be in the domain since $0$ is in the image of $f(x)$ , namely $f(0)=0$ . It fixes this by rationalizing the numerator by multiplying by $1$ as follows: $y=\frac{-1+\sqrt{1+4x^2}}{2x}\cdot \frac{-1-\sqrt{1+4x^2}}{-1-\sqrt{1+4x^2}} = \frac{2x}{1+\sqrt{1+4x^2}}$ Hence $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{2x}{1+\sqrt{1+4x^2}}$ . $\blacksquare$ Question Why is it that multiplying a function by $1$ will add a value for the graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ ? I can see why multiplying by $1$ will sometimes remove points on the graph, namely where the denominator is zero (e.g. multiply an equation by $\frac{x}{x}$ and it won't have a value at $x=0$ ), but how does it work here that multiplying by $1$ adds a point to the graph?

4453696,A confusion on $\beta\eta$-reduction,"Recently I've started exploring lambda calculus, and currently I'm tackling the next exercise: Prove that if $M =_{\beta\eta} N$ , then $FV(M) = FV(N)$ , Where $FV(P)$ stands for free variables in the term $P$ . Obviously, $\eta$ -conversion doesn't affect on the free variables, since $\lambda x.Mx =_\eta M$ exactly when $x \notin FV(M)$ , and $FV(\lambda x.Mx) = FV(M)$ when the same condition holds. But what about $\beta$ -reduction? It's obvious, that if $M \to_\beta N$ , then $FV(N) \subseteq FV(M)$ . It's also known that $\beta$ -reduction can eliminate free variables, as said here or here . How then it might be possible that $FV(M) = FV(N)$ for the stated condition? The simple example $(\lambda x.y)z \to_\beta y$ , and thus $(\lambda x.y)z =_\beta y$ breaks the statement. Maybe there's a typo in the exercise? Or maybe I don't quite understand the difference between $\beta$ -reduction and $\beta$ -equivalence: as far as I understand, if $M \to_\beta N$ , then $M =_\beta N$ , and the latter, the $\beta$ -equivalence, just means (by Church-Rosser) that $\exists L$ such that $M \twoheadrightarrow_\beta L$ and $N \twoheadrightarrow_\beta L$ . But this facts, as I suppose, can't help me to resolve the issue. Seems obvious that there exists such $M$ and $N$ , that $M \twoheadrightarrow_\beta N$ , but the converse doesn't hold. And still it's said that $M =_\beta N$ . Thus $\to_\beta \subset \twoheadrightarrow_\beta \subset =_\beta$ should hold. Then, again, I don't get how the statement in the exercise above holds.

I would like to know the relation between the uniform norm and the operator norm of the differential. For this question to make sense, I must make a few comments... Remembering that the differential of the function $f$ , is $f':U\to \mathcal{L}\left (\mathbb{C},\mathbb{R}^n\right )$ . But in this special case, we are talking about a differentiable curve, and we have a natural isomorphism between $\mathcal{L}\left (\mathbb{C},\mathbb{R}^n\right )$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ so the derivative can be seen as a function $f':U\to \mathbb{R}^n$ . And so we have the uniform norm: $$\|f' \|_\infty =\sup \limits _{z\in U}\|f'(z) \|.$$ Furthermore, seeing the differential as $f'\in \mathcal{L}\left (\mathbb{C},\mathbb{R}^n\right )$ , we can apply the operator norm, $$\|f'(z)\|=\sup \limits _{|v|=1}\|f'(z)\cdot v\|.$$ So, even with this information, I don't know if my question makes much sense, but I would like to know if the two norms are related, more specifically, if $\|f'\|_\infty <\infty$ we will also have $\|f'(z)\|<\infty$ for all $z\in U$ .

[0, \infty ) \ni t \mapsto \mathbb{P} (X_t \in A) = \mathbb{E}[1_A(X_t)] \in [0, 1]. \tag{1}
$$ under the conditions stated below. Here is an example showing that this mapping is not measurable in general. Let $N \subset [0, \infty)$ be a set which is not Borel measurable, and let the random variables $X_t$ , $t \geq 0$ , be such that $\mathbb{P}(X_t =1)=1_N(t)$ . Then clearly $t \mapsto \mathbb{P}(X_t = 1)$ is not measurable. Now assume that: If $(t_n) \subset [0, \infty)$ is such that $t_n \rightarrow t_0 \in [0, \infty)$ , then $\mathbb{P}_{t_n}$ converges weakly to $\mathbb{P}_{t_0}$ . This means that for every continuous and bounded function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ we have $$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \mathbb{P}_{t_n} (dx) = \mathbb{E} [f (X_{t_n})] \overset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \mathbb{P}_{t_0} (dx) = \mathbb{E} [f (X_{t_0})]
$$ The assertion is also true for bounded Lipschitz functions. Does this ensure the measurability? Is it maybe possible to approximate the indicator function $x \mapsto 1_A(x)$ by suitable continuous functions which will imply the measurability? Alternatively, is it possible to obtain a right-continuous modification of $(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ under these conditions? If so, this will ensure the joint measurability of $(t, \omega ) \mapsto X_t (\omega)$ and Tonelli's theorem will yield the measurability of the mapping in $(1)$ . If the answer is affirmative, it would be interesting to see if it also applies to the case where $X_t$ , $t \geq 0$ , are $S$ -valued for a sufficiently nice metric space $S$ .","['probability-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

My proof seems at first glance to be the same as the solution manual's proof, but I don't understand the last step in the terse solution manual proof. Here is my proof $f'$ increasing means $\forall x \forall y, x<y \implies f'(x)<f'(y)$ . Consider a point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ on the graph of $f$ . The tangent line at this point has slope $f'(x_0)$ . Assume this line intersects the graph of $f$ at $(x,f(x))$ . Then $f'(x_0)=\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}$ .

Therefore, by proof by contradiction, we conclude that the tangent line line at any point does not intersect the graph of $f$ at any other point. Here is the proof from the solution manual The tangent line through $(a,f(a))$ is the graph of $$g(x)=f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$ $$=f'(a)x+f(a)-af'(a)$$ If $g(x_0)=f(x_0)$ for some $x_0 \neq a$ , then $$0=g'(x)-f'(x)=f'(a)-f'(x), \text{ for some } x \text{ in } (a,x_0) \text{ or } (x_0,a)\tag{1}$$ This is impossible, since $f'$ is increasing.

My proof attempt: $(\Rightarrow)$ Let $R$ be an antisymmetric relation on $A$ . Suppose $(a,b),(b,a) \in R$ where $a, b \in A$ . Then by definition of antisymmetric it must the case that $a=b$ , so $(a,a) \in R \Rightarrow (a,a) \in R^{-1}$ $\Rightarrow (a,a) \in R\cap R^{-1} \Rightarrow (a,a) \in \{(a,a) : a \in A\}$ . Since $a, b$ were arbitrary elements, $R \cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a) : a \in A\}$ $(\Leftarrow)$ Let $R\cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a) : a\in A\}$ . To be a subset of $\{(a,a) : a \in A\}$ , $R\cap R^{-1}$ must be a set of ordered pairs where the 1st and 2nd terms of the ordered pairs are equal to a single element from $A$ . Consider then, any arbitrary element of A, say $a \in A$ . Then $(a,a) \in A \times A$ and $(a,a) \in R \cap R^{-1}$ . By definition of intersection, $(a,a) \in R$ as well. These results hold for all elements of $A$ , so $R \subseteq A\times A$ . Thus, $R$ is a relation on $A$ by definition. To say $R$ is an antisymmetric relation on $A$ is vacuously true since there will never be an ordered pair of the form $(x, y)$ or $(y,x)$ in $R$ , unless, of course, $x = y$ . Since $R\cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a) : a\in A\} \Rightarrow$ the relation $R$ on set $A$ is antisymmetric And since the relation $R$ on set $A$ is antisymmetric $\Rightarrow R\cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a) : a\in A\}$ Therefore the relation $R$ on set $A$ is antisymmetric $\Leftrightarrow$ $R \cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a) : a \in A\}$ .

If $(a,b) \in R^{-1}$ then $(b,a) \in R$ . By def of antisymmetric, since we have $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ in $R$ , it must be the case that $a = b$ , that is, $(a,a) \in R$ . Then $(a,a) \in R^{-1}$ as well, which means $(a,a) \in R \cap R^{-1}$ . Thus, $(a,b) \in R\cap R^{-1} \Rightarrow (a,a) \in R\cap R^{-1}$ , so $R\cap R^{-1} \subseteq \{(a,a): a \in A\}$ Which as you said, is not true since we could have the case where $R = \emptyset$ which is antisymmetric, and any non-empty $A$ like $a \in A$ then $(a,a) \notin R \cap R^{-1}$ ... how do I get around to showing this result holds for all relations R on A?","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification', 'relations']"

If $\phi_n(x)$ converges uniformly to $\phi(x)$ , prove that $\phi(x)=\int_{x_0}^xf(t,\phi(t))dt$ . If $\phi_n(x)$ just converges to $\phi(x)$ , can we draw the same conclusion by applying Dominated Convergence Theorem like this: $|f|\leqslant M,\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_{x_0}^xf(t,\phi_n(t))dt=\int_{x_0}^x\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}f(t,\phi_n(t))dt=\int_{x_0}^xf(t,\phi(t))dt$ , the first equation by DCT and the second by continuity of $f$ . Attempt: Since $\phi_n$ uniformly converges to $\phi$ ,then $\phi_n$ is bounded and $\phi$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ . So $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]\times[-M,M]$ ,where $|\phi_n|,|\phi|<M$ . Therefore $f(t,\phi_n(t))$ converges uniformly, so we can exchange the limit and integral. Is that correct? Thanks for checking! I'm wondering if DCT is correctly used here.

It seems to me that the conjecture is false if any nontrivial cycle occurs. A non-trivial cycle occurs if $2^{t_k}−3^k$ divides $3^{k−1}+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{𝑘−1}3^{h−1−i}2^{t_i}$ which would seem to me be a high probability if there are an infinite number of distinct values.

Writing $d=b^a-c,$ I obtained a quadratic of $c$ with coefficients in terms of $a$ and $b$ , which led me to the following: $$\left\{ c,d \right\} = \left\{\frac{b^a-\sqrt{b^{2a}-4a^b}}{2},\frac{b^a+\sqrt{b^{2a}-4a^b}}{2}\right\}$$ Therefore, given positive integers $a$ and $b,$ there is a solution if and only if $b^{2a}-4a^b$ is a perfect square.

If the spider is restricted to the cubical boundaries (it can now ""fly in 3-d space"") and the fly is similarly on another cubical boundary, the same algorithm can be extended. Just flatten it out in 3-d space every possible way and find the shortest straight-line path among them. But what do we do if the spider loses its new power and goes back to only crawling on the 2-d surfaces (and the fly is on one of those surfaces as well). Now the trick from before where we flatten out doesn't work anymore. It is impossible to flatten out a Tesseract onto a 2-d surface without having some faces overlap (see: Prove that it isn't possible to flatten a Teserract into 2-d space. ). So what do we do now?

4454485,Good Algorithm to Compute all Subgroups of a Finite Group.,"Let's suppose we have a group $G$ of finite order $n$ . We want to algorithmically compute all subgroups, and there are some ways to do that. First one: Compute all subsets. Verify for each of them if they're closed. Then we're done. It's not precisely an efficient algorithm. For $n=24$ we already have 16 millions of subsets to check. A second one would be to compute all the generated subgroups: Get a prime decomposition $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_{r}^{e_r}$ . Compute $$b=\sum_{i=1}^r (e_i+1).$$ Compute all subsets with at most $b$ elements Compute the generated subgroups of such subsets. We're done. In this case we need an upper bound on the number of generators a subgroup can have. I chose $b$ because it's a slightly worse bound than the one found here , but that doesn't depend on the structure of the group or its subgroups (since it's information we're not given). I'd like to know. Is there a better way? And... is there a better bound for the second method? I mean manually we can use a lot of the structure of the group so most of the time computing  all the subgroups is way easier, but if we want a computer to do it I think it may be hard to implement something like that. Edit: There are some ideas in the comments. Using Sylow (How?) Computing only the subsets which order divides the order of the group. The number of subsets you need to compute is $$\sum_{d\mid n} \binom{n}{d}$$ while the one in my second method is $$\sum_{i=1}^b \binom{n}{i}.$$ At least in the case of $n=24$ that method is not as good in the sense that you have to compute 3587174 subsets instead of 190050 with my method. Edit 2: Because the approach to the problem is different, I don't think this and this questions contain the answer to mine. My questions are 1. If there is a better method (this one is answered), and 2. How to improve the bound for my method (this one has not been answered). Edit 3: For a way to slightly improve the bound I used while still not depending on the structure of each group we just need to see that it always holds that $f_i\geq 1$ (Because of First Sylow theorem and that every $p$ -group has a cyclic subgroup of order $p$ ). So we can use $$b=\sum_{i=1}^r e_i$$ as a better bound. This is a huge improvement for the case of $n=24$ , since in this case $b=4$ and we only need to compute 12950 subsets.","['finite-groups', 'algorithms', 'group-theory', 'computational-complexity', 'computer-science']"

If we know this, we get the desired result simply by continuity of parameter integrals. I can't quite put the argument together.

However, evaluating the limit is tricky because of the behavior of the factor $f_n=[n/(n+1-i)]$ since $i$ spans all the way to $n$ itself. I realized after a bit that $$\mathcal{L} = 2\zeta(a-1)=2\sum\limits_{i\geq 1}\sum\limits_{k\geq 0}\left(\frac{1}{k+i} \right)^a=2\sum\limits_{i\geq 1}\zeta(a,i)$$ where the summand corresponds to the main $i$ -dependent function in the original sum. Although I still don't know how to prove the limit rigorously, it made me wonder if it's true more generally. For example, let $g(a,i)=\exp(-ai)$ and $h(a,i)=(1/i!)^a$ then is it true that for some constant $c$ $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty^{+}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{n}{n+1-i}\right)^{a}g(a,i)\stackrel{?}{=}c\sum\limits_{i\geq 1}g(a,i),\quad (a>0)$$ $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty^{+}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{n}{n+1-i}\right)^{a}h(a,i)\stackrel{?}{=}c\sum\limits_{i\geq 1}h(a,i),\quad (a>0)$$ Numerical evaluations show that $c$ is most likely $1$ in both of these cases. Assuming $\lim\limits{n\to\infty} f_n \sim 1$ , then the limits with $g$ and $h$ make sense. However why doesn't the first limit I proposed follow the same convention and instead have $c=2$ ? It appears that for $0<k<a$ , factor $c$ is reduced back to $1$ (at least by numerical evaluations). $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty^{+}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{n}{n+1-i}\right)^{k}\Big[\zeta(a,i)-\zeta(a,n+1)\Big] \stackrel{?}{=} \zeta(a-1),\quad (a>2)$$ I'm wondering how you guys would approach any of these limits, since I don't have a convincing proof for any of them.

4454968,When does a symmetric matrix admit a positive eigenvector (i.e. $v_i >0 \forall i$) for a positive eigenvalue?,"Let $S \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a symmetric matrix. I am trying to understand when such a matrix possesses a positive eigenvector for a positive eigenvalue, that is a $v \in \mathbb{R}^n, v_i >0 \forall i$ , $\lambda>0$ , such that $$Sv = \lambda v.$$ So, basically I am looking for a more general answer to this question . It is obvious that if we have one such eigenvector then by orthogonality the other eigenvectors have to have alternating signs. Also, one can see that in general $S$ should be similar to a matrix with constant row sum (see my question here ). But this holds in the general case and does not yet use anything about the symmetry of the matrix. Can we somehow make use of this special structure to find another necessary condition on $S$ , or can we maybe get some bounds on $\lambda$ ? Edit Of course one can get a very crude bound on the eigenvalues by the row sum of absolute values: Let $v$ be a positive eigenvector for eigenvalue $\lambda$ , $||v|| =1$ . Then $$\lambda v_i = \sum_j S_{ij} v_j \leq \sum_j |S_{ij}| v_j \leq \max_k v_k \sum_j |S_{ij}|$$ so $$ \lambda \leq \max_i \sum_j |S_{ij}|.$$ But this bound is rather useless, since for example $$S = \begin{pmatrix} n & -n+\epsilon \\ -n+\epsilon & n \end{pmatrix}$$ has eigenpair $\left( (1,1), \epsilon\right)$ , while the bound is $2n + \epsilon$ . Edit2 : After some more thought one can obtain a bound by the (signed) rowsums, which is better than the above:
Let $v$ be positive eigenvector for $\lambda$ such that $||v||_1 = \sum_i v_i = 1$ .
Then by summing up the equation above we get $$ \lambda \sum_i v_i = \sum_i (\sum_j S_{ij} v_j)  = \sum_i v_i (\sum_j S_{ij})$$ Now for a positive, unit $l_1$ -norm vector $v$ and another vector $w$ we have $\min_i w_i \leq v^Tw \leq \max_i w_i$ . Thus, with $w_i = (\sum_j S_{ij})$ we obtain $$ \min_i (\sum_j S_{ij}) \leq \lambda \leq \max_i (\sum_j S_{ij}),$$ which in our above example already determines $\epsilon$ .
(In general this shows that for constant row sum $c$ this is the only possible eigenvalue with a positive eigenvector. In fact, one can also say that in the other direction, there only is a positive  eigenvector  corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda =  \max_i (\sum_j S_{ij})$ if the row-sum is constant: Since we required $v_i>0$ , the greater/lesser equal above only allows for equality when the row sum is the same for all $i$ ) Another (obvious) condition that $S$ has to fulfill, which does not seem to follow from the above, is that in every row, there has to be at least one positive entry (else for that row $\sum_j S_{ij} v_j \leq 0$ .)","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'symmetric-matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

I don’t know whether my solution is right, so I’ll post it here. My solution: If $x \neq 0$ , than $f(x,y) = x^2  \sin(y/x^2)$ is differentiable as it is the product of differentiable functions. Now for $x=0$ , let's consider the limit: $$\begin{align*}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(h,y) - f(0,y)}{h} &= \lim_{h \to 0} h^2\sin(\frac{y}{h^2})\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} h^2\sin(yh^{-2})\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} h^{2} = 0 
\end{align*}$$ Therefore the function $f$ is differentiable. MY NEW SOLUTION :
I first calculated the partial derivatives with respect to x and y with limits at the point $(0,y)$ . $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,y)= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(0+h,y)-f(0,y)}{h} = 0$ $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,y) = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(0,y+k)-f(0,y)}{k} = \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{0-0}{k} = 0$ Consequently, since $f(x, 0) = 0$ and the only candidate for a derivative matrix is $f'(x, 0) = (0, 0)$ , we have: $E(h,k):= f(0+h,y+k) = f(h,y+k) = h^2 \sin(\frac{y+k}{h^2})$ Then: $0 \leq \frac{|E(h,k)|}{||(h,k)||} \leq \frac{h^2\sin(\frac{y+k}{h^2})}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}} \leq |h| \cdot \frac{|h|}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}} \leq |h|$ This converge to zero when $(h,k) \to 0$ , therefore $f$ is differentiable at the point $(0,y)$ .",['multivariable-calculus']
4455078,Is there a purely topological proof that a certain topological space derived from logical compactness is compact?,"Let $L$ be a first order language, and let $S_{L}=\{\sigma:\sigma\;\mbox{is an $L$-sentence}\}$ . Also, by logical compatness I mean the Compactness Theorem of first order logic. Compactness Theorem: Let $\Sigma$ be a set of $L$ -sentences. $\Sigma$ is satisfiable if and only if each finite subset of $\Sigma$ is satisfiable. Now, we may consider the set $X=\{M:M\;\mbox{is an $L$-structure}\}$ and define a topology on $X$ as follows: For each $L$ -sentence $\sigma$ define a basic open set $U_{\sigma}=\{M\in X:M\vDash\sigma\}$ . Open sets in $X$ are arbitrary unions and finite intersections of the basic open sets $U_{\sigma}$ . A few facts we observe are: $X$ does not seem to be Hausdorff (not even $T_{0}$ ), and the connected components of $X$ appear to be the equivalence classes of structures by the relation $\equiv$ of elementary equivalence of $L$ -structures . In fact, for each $L$ -structure $M$ we let $T_{M}=\{\sigma\in S_{L}:M\vDash\sigma\}$ , and consider the set $Y=\{T_{M}:M\;\mbox{is an $L$-structure}\}$ . We can define a topology on $Y$ by defining open sets in $Y$ to be arbitrary unions and finite intersections of basic open sets $V_{\sigma}$ defined for each $L$ -sentence $\sigma$ by $V_{\sigma}=\{T\in Y:\sigma\in T\}$ . With this topology $Y$ is totally separated, and hence totally disconnected and Hausdorff. In fact it seems to be homeomorphic to $X/\negthickspace\equiv$ in the quotient topology. I believe I can show that the Compactness Theorem is true if and only if $Y$ (resp. $X$ ) is a compact space. My question is: Is there a purely topological proof showing that $Y$ (resp $X$ ) is a compact topological space? Note: Where does this question come from? From working out the analogous situation for propositional logic (i.e. $L$ is a propositional language) and trying to work out the case for first order logic. For propositional logic the analogously obtained $X$ (space of $L$ -valuations) and $Y$ are really homeomorphic, and readily seen to be homeomorphic to $\{0,1\}^{L}$ with the product topology. Hence, the Tychonoff Theorem provides the answer to my question. I have not found such a simple path for the first order situation I have described. Perhaps I should define $X$ and $Y$ differently? Where I am going wrong? Thanks to the comments by Greg Nisbet and Chris Eagle that pointed out $X$ being a proper class. The $U_{\sigma}$ seem proper classes also. Hence, $X$ is given a topology in which the closed ""sets” are proper classes (except for the empty set). Can we speak of $X$ being a compact class? It's quotient by $\equiv$ is indeed a set. Are there any conditions on $L$ or otherwise that would make $X$ a set? (Chris Eagle points to some in a comment below) Ok, $X$ is a proper class, it can be given a topology with the basic closed ""sets"" being the proper classes $U_{\sigma}$ . All is well since $U_{\sigma}\cup U_{\tau}=U_{\sigma\vee\tau}$ , and every closed subclass is of the form $$\displaystyle\bigcap_{\sigma\in S} U_{\sigma},$$ for some subset $S$ of $L$ -sentences. Now, is this topology compact? Well, in order for logical compactness to say that $X$ is compact we would need that $$\displaystyle\bigcap_{\sigma\in S} U_{\sigma}\neq\emptyset,$$ whenever $S\subseteq S_{L}$ , and that for every finite subset $S_0$ of $S$ $$\displaystyle\bigcap_{\sigma\in S_0} U_{\sigma}\neq\emptyset.$$ I think, one way to make sure $X$ is a set would be to define it to contain only the $L$ -structures $M$ satisfying the satisfiable sets of $L$ -sentences. That is, for every satisfiable set $S$ of $L$ -sentences let $M_{S}$ be an $L$ -structure such that $M_{S}\vDash S$ . Define $$X=\{M_{S}:S\;\mbox{is a satisf. set of $L$-sentences}\}$$ This question is related, and Noah Schweber provides a very useful answer there as well a here.","['general-topology', 'predicate-logic', 'logic', 'first-order-logic']"

User can ask the opponent to generate a new value using the values a and b and show it to the user. The user can ask for a new number infinitely. ✅ Solution In the first battle, the user wins. Because after generating so many numbers, the user eventually finds a and b or at least gets very close to them. Second-order statistical battle Imagine a new game where the opponent hides four static values a , b , c , and d . The same rules of the previous game apply to this game, but instead of only a and b , they apply to c and d as well.

The opponent then generates a new number using (X, Y) and sends it to the user. Can the user find out what those four values are eventually? ❓ Possible solution?
