2859554,Curve shortening flow with boundary,"Let $(M^2,g)$ be a 2-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold (e.g. $(\mathbb{R}^2,\delta_{ij})$) and $p,q\in M$ two points with $p\neq q$.

When does the curve shortening flow starting at $\gamma$ converge to a geodesic segment joining $p$ and $q$, i.e. the ""shortest"" curve joining the two points? I am aware of Grayson's result that an embedded closed curve in a 2-manifold either shrinks to a round point or converges to a geodesic.

2859666,Multivariable Taylor's formula and approximation (big O),"I post here because I encounter a problem to understand something. To begin, let consider $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a n times differentiable function. Then, we have, by the Taylor's formula : $$ \forall a, h \in \mathbb{R}^n \quad f(a+h)=f(a)+Df_a(h) + ... + \frac{1}{n!}D^nf_a(h^n) + o_o(||h||^n)$$ So, when $n=1$, it's easy to see that each term of the taylor expansion is ""bigger"" than the next one, i.e for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we have : $D^kf_a(h^k)=f^{(k)}(a)h^k$ and then $o(h^k) = o(D^kf_a(h^k))$, but I've some trouble when $n>1$. Actually, for $n=2$ and the taylor formula at the order 2, we have : $D^2f_a((x_1, x_2), (x_1,x_2)) = \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_1^2}(a) x_1^2 + 2\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}(a) x_1x_2 + \frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_2^2}(a) x_2^2$ And I want to show that : $o(||(x_1,x_2)||^2) = o(||D^2f_a((x_1, x_2), (x_1,x_2))||)$. By considering (and utilizating the equivalence of the norm in finite dimension), if I consider the norm $||(x_1,x_2)|| = \max (|x_1|, |x_2|)$, then I have : $D^2f_a((x_1, x_2), (x_1,x_2)) = O(||(x_1,x_2)||^2)$, but I whould like to have $||(x_1,x_2)||^2 = O(||D^2f_a((x_1, x_2), (x_1,x_2))||)$. But, still with the norm max, if I consider $x_1x_2$, I should have : $x_1x_2$ which verify : $x_1x_2 \geq C||(x_1,x_2)^2||$, but if I consider $(x_1,x_2) = (e, e^2)$, for $e<<0$, I have : $e^3 \geq Ce^2$, which is not true. So, I'm kind of lost. And here, I've only considered $\mathbb{R}^n$, but what happen if I consider a vector space of infinite dimension ?

2859708,Critical Points Clarification,"I'm uncertain if I have all the critical points required of the system I do $\frac{dx}{dt} = x(x-2) + y^2$...and likewise..I do $\frac{dy}{dt}= y(1-x)$ I then set both equations to zero If we set $x = 0$ in the first equation, we solve the second equation $y = 0$
If we set $y = 0$ in the second equation, we solve the first equation for $x = 0$ and $x = 2$. 
Likewise, I solve for y - xy = 0. Then xy = y so x = 1. We plug this solution into the first equation so that y^2 = 1 and hence, have (1,1),(1,-1) as our results as well. Hence, my critical points are then $(0,0);(2,0)$;(1,1);(1,-1) Is this the correct approach for this particular question?

2859820,Fermat's Last Theorem and Faltings' Theorem.,"I apologise for all these questions of Fermat's Last Theorem, but I am fascinated by the topic, even if I cannot understand all of it. I must admit that I am not well versed in the language of modular forms or elliptic equations, but they seem quite complicated to me. However, while reading Simon Singh's book ""Fermat's Last Theorem"", I found one particular bit very interesting. I immediately thought that there was an easier way to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. It was to do with Falting's Theorem and the geometrical representations of equations like $x^n + y^n = 1$. I quote: ""Faltings was able to prove that, because these shapes always have more than one hole, the associated Fermat equation could only have a finite number of whole number solutions."" Surely, now all that is needed is to prove that a Fermat equation has infinite solutions. Suppose we take the original equation:
$$A^3 + B^3 = C^3$$
Surely we can find infinite solutions to this by doubling $A, B, C$
$$(2A)^3 + (2B)^3 = (2C)^3$$
$$8A^3 + 8B^3 = 8C^3$$
$$A^3 + B^3 = C^3$$
Surely this means there are infinitely many solutions to these equations.
But now we have a contradiction, so therefore our original assumption, that $A^3 + B^3 = C^3$ has solutions, is false. Who can point out my error as this seems a very simple step to take from Falting's to Fermat's. And surely that step wouldn't have taken years to take, especially for Andrew Wiles.",['number-theory']
2859827,"A closed form for $\int_0^\pi \lvert \sin(m t) \cos(n t) \rvert \, \mathrm{d} t$","Motivated by this nice question I have been trying to compute the function $f: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]$ defined by $$f(\alpha) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} \int \limits_0^x \lvert\sin(\alpha s) \cos(s)\rvert \, \mathrm{d} s \, .$$ Note that $f(\alpha) \leq \frac{1}{2}$ follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. In the answers to the original question the equidistribution theorem is used to show that $f(3 - 2 \sqrt{2}) = \frac{4}{\pi^2}$ holds. This argument can be extended to every irrational number, so we have $f(\alpha) = \frac{4}{\pi^2} \approx 0.405285$ for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^+ \setminus \mathbb{Q}^+$ . For rational arguments we can take $m , n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\gcd(m,n) =1$ . The change of variables $s = n t$ yields $$ f \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} \int \limits_0^x \lvert\sin(m t) \cos(n t)\rvert \, \mathrm{d} t \, .$$ The integrand is periodic with period $\pi$ , so $$ f \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} \left[\bigg\lfloor \frac{x}{\pi} \bigg\rfloor \int \limits_0^\pi \lvert\sin(m t) \cos(n t)\rvert \, \mathrm{d} t + \mathcal{O} (1)\right] = \frac{1}{\pi} \int \limits_0^\pi \lvert\sin(m t) \cos(n t)\rvert \, \mathrm{d} t\, .$$ Now the idea is to split the interval of integration into subintervals on which the sign of the product is constant and then use $$ \sin(m t) \cos(n t) = \frac{\sin[(m+n)t] + \sin[(m-n)t]}{2}$$ to find the integrals. The result is basically given by a finite sum of cosines evaluated at the zeroes of the integrand. The first few results are \begin{align}
f(1) &= \frac{1}{\pi} \approx 0.318301 \, , \\ 
f(2) &= \frac{4}{3 \pi} \approx 0.424413 \, , \\
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= \frac{2(2\sqrt{2}-1)}{3\pi} \approx 0.388004 \, .
\end{align} Interestingly, most of the other values (especially those with large $m$ and $n$ ) seem to be very close to $\frac{4}{\pi^2}$ . This method can be used (at least in principle) to compute $f$ at every rational argument, but it becomes increasingly complicated for larger values of $m$ and $n$ . Maybe I am overlooking a simple trick, maybe there is a better method. My question is: How can we find a general expression for $f\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)$ with arbitrary coprime $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ ? Edit 1 July 2020 Thanks to Zacky's bounty and River Li's and asgeige's nice answers we have some closed-form results for special cases and a promising (but still somewhat complicated) conjecture for the general case. Using similar methods, I have also found $$ f(m) = \frac{2}{\pi (m^2-1)} \left[m \csc \left(\frac{\pi}{2m}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2m} 1_{2\mathbb{N}}(m)\right) - 1_{2 \mathbb{N}-1}(m)\right]$$ for $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$ ( $1_A$ is the indicator function of the set $A$ ), which implies $\lim_{m \to \infty} f(m) = \frac{4}{\pi^2}$ . While a simple expression for general values of $m,n$ seems unlikely, it may be possible to show that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \frac{4}{\pi^2}$ and $\lim_{m \to \infty} f \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \frac{4}{\pi^2}$ do indeed hold for fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , respectively. Edit 11 January 2021 Thanks to River Li's second answer we now have a proof of the conjectured limits. We can even use partial fractions and the pole expansions of $\csc$ and $\cot$ to simplify the remaining series and obtain the following general result (valid for $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ coprime and not both equal to $1$ ): $$ f\left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \frac{g_m\left(\frac{\pi}{2m}\right) - g_m \left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}{m^2-n^2} \, , \, g_m = \begin{cases} x \mapsto \frac{\csc(x)}{x} &, \, m \in 2 \mathbb{N} - 1 \\ x \mapsto \frac{\cot(x)}{x} &, \, m \in 2 \mathbb{N}\end{cases} \, . $$","['limits', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'trigonometric-integrals']"

So, $4ab= 64, ab = 16$ Denote shaded region with $S$ Denote area of triangle $DGH = A_1$ and triangle $FBE = A_2$.

The area of $A_1$ and $A_2$, is the same and i got it with this way: Since, the $\angle{GDH} = 90$ and the median from this angle to the base $HG$, that is the altitude of the triangle $DGH$,  will measure the half of the $HG$ side. And the $HG$ side by Pythagorean theorem, will be $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, that will be the base of the triangle. And the altitude will be: $\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2} $, So the Area of $A_1 = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}$ So, $A_1 + A_2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$ Then, $64 - (\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}) = S$ And, $-(a^2 - 8ab + b^2) = 2S$ And I have not been able to continue from here, what should I do?

2859872,"$X$ compact, $C(X)$ equipped with inner product, evaluation maps continuous, prove $X$ is finite","I'm working on the following problem from Conway V.4. Let $X$ be compact and supppose there is a norm on $C(X)$ that is given by an inner product making $C(X)$ into a Hilbert space such that for every $x \in X$ the functional $\Lambda_x : f\mapsto f(x)$ is continuous with respect to the Hilbert space norm.  Show $X$ is finite. Idea on approach: I think we need to assume $X$ is infinite and come to some sort of contradiction. Facts noted: $\text{ball}{(C(X))}$ is weakly compact. $X^* \subset C(X)$, $X^*$ is definitely a subspace, and if it is closed under the norm induced by the inner product we have $X^*$ is Hilbert and hence reflexive. (Since I am not sure of the closedness of $X^*$ under the norm, I am not sure if this could be useful.) The hypothesis is allowing us to extend the notion of a weak-$*$ topology on $X^*$ to $C(X)$. The continuity of the $\Lambda_x$'s and Riesz Rep theorem imply that there is a $g \in C(X)$ such that $\Lambda_x(f) = \langle f,g \rangle = |f(x)| \leq M \langle f,f\rangle^{1/2}$. I'm not entirely sure how to put these pieces together.  I was hoping to take a $X \supset \{x_n\}$ with $x_n \to x$, and by weak compactness we have for any sequence $\{f_j\} \subset \text{ball}(C(X))$ there is a subsequence such that $f_{j_k}$ converges weakly to some $f \in \text{ball}(C(X))$, which by our hypotheses implies that $f_{j_k}(x_n) \to f(x_n)$ as $k \to\infty$.  We also know that $f_{j_k}(x_n) \to f_{j_k}(x)$ as $n\to \infty$.  But there is nothing contradictory I can see coming from this observation. Any hints would be appreciated. Thanks. Edit: Also not entirely sure how $X$ compact fits in exactly, as I don't think I've taken much advantage of that fact in my observations except for claiming there is a convergent sequence.","['functional-analysis', 'compactness', 'hilbert-spaces']"

2859999,An algebraic proof that every finite extension of $\mathbb Q$ is ramified?,"A basic result in algebraic number theory is that every proper finite extension of $\mathbb Q$ is ramified over $\mathbb Q$.  This is proved by considering Minkowski's lower bound on the discriminant. I read somewhere that there is no known proof of this result which is purely algebraic.  However, can we argue like this? Let $A$ be a ring, and let $B$ be an algebra over $A$ which is finite and projective as an $A$-module.  Then the trace map $\operatorname{Tr}: B \rightarrow A$ can be defined.  We say that $B$ is separable over $A$ if $b \mapsto \phi_b, \phi_b(b') = \operatorname{Tr}(bb')$ defines an isomorphism of $A$-modules $B \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_A(B,A)$.  Let's say that $B$ is etale over $A$ if it is finite, projective, and separable over $A$. Then the result that every proper finite extension of $\mathbb Q$ is ramified follows from these two results: (i): Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain with quotient field $K$, and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in a finite separable extension $L$ of $K$.  If no prime of $A$ ramifies in $B$, then $B$ is etale as an $A$-algebra. (ii): Every etale ring extension of $\mathbb Z$ is of the form $\mathbb Z^n$. As far as I can tell, these two results are not hard.  The first follows from the answer to my question here , and I'm currently working out the second. Does this argument give a simple proof for why there are no unramified extensions of $\mathbb Q$?  It seems a little too easy.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

Let $V$ be a real $d$-dimensional vector space of dimension $d > 6$. Let $B \in \GL(\bigwedge^2V) $, and suppose that $$ B(v_1) \wedge B(v_2) \wedge B(v_3)=v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge v_3 \in \bigwedge^6V  \tag{*} $$ for every multi-vectors $v_1,v_2,v_3 \in \bigwedge^2V $. Is it true that $B=\text{Id}_V$? If it helps, we can also assume that $B$ maps decomposable elements to decomposable elements. It is important that $\dim V>6$. If $\dim V=6$, one can take any $B=\bigwedge^2 A$, where $A \in \GL(V)$ has determinant one. Edit: This seems to be true for diagonal maps $B$. Thus it also holds for diagonalizable maps (by multiplicativity). Indeed, suppose $v_i$ is a basis for $ \bigwedge^2V $, and that $Bv_i=\lambda_i  v_i$. Then condition $(*)$ implies $\lambda_{i_1} \lambda_{i_2} \lambda_{i_3}=1$ for every distinct triplet $1\le i_1,i_2,i_3 \le \binom{d}{2}=\dim(\bigwedge^2V )$. Now we think of the diagonal matrix $A=\text{diag}(\lambda_i)$ as a linear map $W \to W$, where $W=\bigwedge^2V$ is a $\binom{d}{2}$-dimensional vector space. Then the $3$-th exterior power of $A$, $\bigwedge^3 A=\text{Id}_W$. Since $3 < \dim(W)$, this implies $A=\text{Id}$, so $B=\text{Id}$ as required. We might try to generalize this claim for non-diagonalizable maps, perhaps via some density argument (over $\mathbb{C}$), but at the moment I don't see how to do this.","['exterior-algebra', 'determinant', 'representation-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

2860289,Minimum mean squared error of an estimator of the variance of the normal distribution [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Variance with minimal MSE in normal distribution (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . I am trying to find the estimator of the variance $\sigma^2$ of a normal distribution with the minimum mean square error. From reading up, I know the unbiased estimator of the variance of a Guassian is  $\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2$ and that the estimator I am looking for is a scaled version of this unbiased estimator. The question is from a problem sheet from the last academic year. The specific question is: Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a simple random sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Consider estimators of $\sigma^2$ of the form $k \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2$ and find the value of $k$ that minimises the mean square error. What is the efficiency of the usual unbiased estimator relative to this estimator, if the relative efficiency is defined as the ratio of the mean squared error? For the first part, I think I am meant to rewrite the MSE of the estimator as an expectation and then take derivatives with respect to $k$. This is what I have so far: $$
\begin{align}
MSE(\hat{\theta}) &= \mathbb{E} \left[ (\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2 \right] \\
&= \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(k \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2 - \sigma^2 \right)^2 \right] \\
&= \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(k \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X} )^2 \right)^2 - 2 \left( k \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2 \right) \sigma^2 + \sigma^4 \right] 
\end{align}
$$ But however else I continue from here, I can't find a way that gets me to $ k = \frac{1}{n + 1}$, which the Wikipedia article linked to below suggests is the answer. For the second part, I think I can use the MSE of the unbiased estimator given in the Wikipedia article to find the efficiency, although it would be really helpful to see the steps that one takes to calculate this MSE, as in the article it is just stated. My question is linked to this one , although less advanced. The Wikipedia article on the MSE linked to in the question above is also relevant, although there they also calculate $ \mathbb{E} [S^4_{n-1}]$, which I'm not sure about.","['mean-square-error', 'normal-distribution', 'variance', 'statistics', 'parameter-estimation']"
2860352,How do we understand 6 people trying something is not 6 times the success rate? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What's 4 times more likely than 80%? (6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Let's say if a task has a success rate of $20\%$, or $0.2$, meaning if a person tries it, then there is a $20\%$ chance he can succeed. One example is, if we generate a random number from 1 to 10, and getting the number 9 or 10 is considered to be a success. Now, if we let 6 people try it, and one person succeeding is considered a success, we cannot say the success rate is $6$ times as much, because then the success rate is $20\% \times 6 = 120\%$, and probability cannot be greater than $100\%$.  So the success rate is not 6 times as much. However, if we let 1 person try it $1,000,000$ times, the Law of Large Numbers says that the number of times he will succeed is $200,000$. And if we let 6 people try $1,000,000$ times each, then the number of success is indeed $200,000 \times 6 = 1,200,000$ which is $6$ times.  How can we understand this? In a real life example, say, each time when we catch a Pokemon, let's say there is a special type of Pokemon that when you tap on it, it can be ""shiny"", and the probability is $1/256$.  Now if one player try to tap on $300$ Pokemon, the probability of getting at least one shiny is not $1$, but less than $1$.  If we let 6 people, each try to tap on $300$ Pokemon (and a Pokemon can be non-shiny for player 1 but is shiny for player 2, meaning it is independent), then the probability of getting at least one shiny is not $6$ times. Now, however, if we let all 6 players, each tap on $3,000,000$ Pokemon, then the number of shiny Pokemon they will get is in fact $6$ times  if we only allow 1 player to play.

Royden had given a proof of this proposition in Collary 18 in that Chapter but there seems to be a mistake in it. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence in $L^p$ that convergences strongly to $f$ in $L^p(E)$. By taking a subsequence if necessary and relabelling , we suppose $\{f_n\}$ is rapidly Cauchy. Therefore, according to Theorem 6 of Chapter 7, $\{f_n\}$ convergences pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$. Since $\phi$ is continuous, ${\phi\circ f_n}$ convergences pointwise a.e. on E to $\phi\circ f$. Moreover, by the completeness of $L^p(E)$, since ${f_n}$ is rapid Cauchy in $L^p(E)$, the function
  $$g = |f_1| + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |{f_{n+1}-f_n}| $$
  belongs to $L^p(E)$. It is clear that
  $$ |f_n| \le g \text{ a.e. on E for all } n. $$

  $$ |\phi\circ f_n| \le a + b \cdot |f_n|^p \le a + b\cdot g^p \text{ a.e. on E for all }n.$$
  We infer from the Dominated Convergence Theorem that
  $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_E \phi\circ f_n = \int_E\phi\circ f. $$
  Therefore T is continuous on $L^p(E)$. But, why could one take a subsequence if necessary as in the boldface text above?

We know that $\mathcal{A}\cong C(\Omega(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\Omega(\mathcal{A})\subseteq\mathcal{A}'_{\geq 0}$. Note that for $\varphi\in\mathcal{A}'$ we define $\varphi\geq 0$ exactly in case $\langle f,\varphi\rangle$ for all $f\in\mathcal{A}$ with $f\geq 0$ (whereby the order relation is the usual one on C${}^{\ast}$-Algebras). Consider now the linear hull $\langle\Omega(\mathcal{A})\rangle$. Question 1. Is this dense in $\mathcal{A}'$ under the weak topology, that is, is it $\sigma(\mathcal{A}',\mathcal{A}'')$-weakly dense? Application. Suppose that $\xi,\eta\in\mathcal{A}''$ satisfy $\xi\leq\eta$ on $\Omega(\mathcal{A})$, that is $\langle\xi,\varphi\rangle\leq\langle\eta,\varphi\rangle$ for all $\varphi\in\Omega(\mathcal{A})$. If the above is true, then it holds that $\xi\leq\eta$, that is, that $\langle\xi,\varphi\rangle\leq\langle\eta,\varphi\rangle$ for all $\varphi\in\mathcal{A}'$ with $\varphi\geq 0$. It is trivial to show this for $\xi,\eta\in\mathcal{A}$ (viewed as a subspace of $\mathcal{A}''$ in the canonical fashion), but I cannot seem to show this without the above result. Perhaps there is a counterexample, so that the desired application fails and the above result is necessarily false. Further observations. Due to the Riesz-Representation theorem, and since $\Omega(\mathcal{A})$ is compact Hausdorff for abelian C${}^{\ast}$-Algebras with a unit, we have $\mathcal{A}'\cong C(\Omega(\mathcal{A}))'=\langle\{T_{\mu}\mid\mu~\text{(reg.) prob. meas. on $\Omega(\mathcal{A})$}\}\rangle$, where $T_{\mu}:f\in C(\Omega(\mathcal{A}))\mapsto\int f~\mathrm{d}\mu$. So it is necessary and sufficient to show that all probability measures on $\Omega(\mathcal{A})$ can be weakly approximated by linear combinations of characters. Here we replace/identify each character $\tau\in\Omega(\mathcal{A})$ with $\hat{\tau}:\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(\mathcal{A}))\mapsto \tau(a)=\hat{a}(\tau)$, where $a\in\mathcal{A}\mapsto\hat{a}\in C(\Omega(\mathcal{A}))$ is the canonical Gelfand-C${}^{\ast}$-isomorphism. That is, each character is the identified with the point measure $\hat{\tau}=\delta_{\tau}$. Now, the convex hull of the set of point measures can be easily shown to be $w^{\ast}$-dense in the set of probability measures identified as a subspace of $C(K)'$, where $K=\Omega(\mathcal{A})$. Is it also $w$-dense? Hence the reduced problem: Question 2. Is the convex hull of the set of point measures over a compact Hausdorff space weakly dense in the set of probability measures?","['c-star-algebras', 'banach-spaces', 'dual-spaces', 'weak-topology', 'measure-theory']"

2860715,How to solve Black Scholes equation directly without using probability,"Given constants $r,\sigma, K>0$, considering the Black-Scholes PDE of a Europoean call:
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}+rs\frac{\partial c}{\partial s}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2 \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial s^2}-rc = 0\\
c(T,s) =(s-K)^+\\
c(t,0) = 0
\end{cases}
I learned that we can do the substitution like this:
\begin{cases}
\tau=T-t\\
u=ce^{r\tau}\\
x=\ln\frac{s}{K}+(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)(T-t)
\end{cases}
Set $u=u(\tau,x)$, then $c(t,s)=e^{-r\tau}u(\tau,x)$. Then we have:
\begin{gather*}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}
= re^{-r\tau}u+e^{-r\tau}(\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} \frac{d \tau}{dt} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t})
= e^{-r\tau}[ru-\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau}- (r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}]\\
\frac{\partial c}{\partial s} = e^{-r\tau}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} = e^{-r\tau}\frac{1}{s}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial s^2} = e^{-r\tau}[-\frac{1}{s^2}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{1}{s^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}]=e^{-r\tau}\frac{1}{s^2}(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x})
\end{gather*}
Thus:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}+rs\frac{\partial c}{\partial s}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2 \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial s^2}-rc 
&= e^{-r\tau}[-\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau}- (r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + r\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x})]\\
&= e^{-r\tau}[-\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}]\\
&=0
\end{align*}
Namely we get the heat equation with boundary condition:
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\\
u(0,x)=K(e^x - 1)^+\\
u(\tau, -\infty) = 0
\end{cases}
I am stuck here. Since the boundary condition is not integrable, I cannot use Fourier transformation with regard to $x$ here. I know there is a probabilistic way of doing it, by computing the conditional expectation. I want to solve the PDE directly. After getting the heat equation here, what should I do next to solve it? Besides, is there any way to start directly from the PDE of $c$, without change of variable? And, how do we know that change of variable work here? It seems to me very coincidentally the PDE becomes a heat equation in the end. Thank you so much!","['heat-equation', 'finance', 'probability', 'partial-differential-equations']"
2860739,Pontryagin class $p_1$ on (non-)spin manifolds,"Pontryagin classes are cohomology groups with degree a multiple of four, which are defined for real vector bundles. Let us consider $p_1$ of $SO(N)$ bundle, the 4th Pontryagin class of $SO(N)$, for $N=3$. How can we prove that $p_1$ can be only an even integer on the spin manifold? How can we prove that $p_1$ can be an integer on the non-spin manifold? (What are explicit examples for $p_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, or $p_1=1$ on which non-spin manifold? e.g. $\mathbb{CP}^2$ or $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and what elses?) Two References I find may be helpful to answer this (somewhat technical) are here: Chern-Simons invariants, SO(3) instantons, and Z/2-homology cobordism,
by Matthew Hedden, Paul Kirk On the Pontryagin Classes of Certain SO(n)-Bundles Over Manifolds, by Michel A. Kervaire Note added: Given any  $SO(3)$ connection $A$ on a bundle $E$ over a 4-manifold $M$, let $F(A)$ denote its curvature 2-form.  Define the Pontryagin charge of $A$  to be the real number 
$$
p_1(A)=-\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_{M}  \operatorname{Tr}(F(A)\wedge F(A)) ,

provided this integral converges.  When $M$ is closed, $p_1(A)=\langle p_1(E),[M]\rangle\in \mathbb{Z}$ at the least, but it could also be $2\mathbb{Z}$ or $4\mathbb{Z}$. It looks that we need to use some properties of instanton solution whose curvature form satisfies the equation $F(A)=-\star F(A)$ to prove the above two statements I made. However, it is not obvious to me that how the spin or non-spin manifold enter to affect the instanton solution. I suppose we need to use $w_1(M)$ and $w_2(M)$ as zeros or non-zeros neatly in order to show the (1) and (2).","['fiber-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'characteristic-classes', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
2860741,"adapted process, translation between measurable and information?","Although there are plenty of questions and answers on understanding the intuition for adapted process like this post and this post I am still unclear on how an adapted filtration 'captures the information of the process up to time $t$.' First some notation, let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space. $X:T\times \Omega \to (S, \Sigma)$ be a stochastic process.  That is $X_t:= X(t,\cdot)$ is an $(\mathcal{F}, \Sigma)$-measurable function for all $t\in T.$ $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}$ such that $\mathcal{F}_s\subset \mathcal{F}_t$ for $s\leq t$ be a filtration of $\mathcal{F}.$ Definition: We say $X_t$ is adapted to the filtration $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}$ if $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t.$ The definition is clear as day but I am confused about the interpretation/intuition/motivation.  A classic example is the price of a stock, $S_t$ which is adapted to the natural filtration of the Brownian motion on which it is modeled $S_t = \exp(ut + \sigma B_t).$  The interpretation on the adapted filtration condition is that we only know the current price of the stock (and its history) but we don't know the future price of the stock. Question: (stock version): Why does the stock being adapted filtration have anything to do with knowing its current and historical prices? I don't see the connection mathematically. In real life we have a stock and we know its price and its history.  I can't see the connection between this and that condition that $S_t$ be $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.  A discrete example might help illustrate my confusion. Discrete Example Consider the example of flipping a coin 3 times. With $X_i$ being 1 if the $i$th flip is heads and $X_i$ is 0 if the $i$th flip is tails.  Let 
$$\Omega = \{hhh, hht, hth, htt,ttt, tth, tht, thh\}$$ be the state space of the experiment and $\mathcal{F}$ all subsets of $\Omega.$  Then we define the stochastic process $X$ by $$X:\{1,2,3\}\times \Omega \to (S,\Sigma)$$ with $S=\{0,1\}$ and $\Sigma$ all subsets of $S.$ The smallest possible filtration to which $X$ is adapted is the natural filtration .  We compute $$\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}_1 &= \sigma(\{X_1^{-1}(A)| A\in \Sigma\})\\
              &= \sigma(\{X_1^{-1}(\emptyset), X_1^{-1}(0), X_1^{-1}(1), X_1^{-1}(\{0,1\})\}\\
              &= \{\emptyset, \{ttt,tth,tht,thh\}, \{hhh,hht,hth,htt\}, \Omega\}
              \end{align}$$ In this case adaptability translates to forcing $X_1$ to constant on the sets $\{ttt,tth,tht,thh\}$ and $\{hhh,hht,hth,htt\}.$  But how does this help us?  It certainly doesn't tell us which set happened and which didn't.  I can see that $X_2$ is not $\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable, but so what?  Knowing $\mathcal{F}_1$ doesn't give us any knowledge about the result of the first toss, other that it was either a heads or a tails, which we already knew.  So now I am ready to state my more general question Question Why does the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_t$  'contain information' about the process up to time $t$ and what does this mean?  How can we use it to say something concrete about what has actually happened up to time $t$ and how can we justify this mathematically?","['stochastic-processes', 'finance', 'measure-theory', 'filtrations']"

$$\ -\frac{dy}{y+4}=x\,dx $$ Integrate left and write parts: $$-\ln(y+4)=\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C $$ Here we see that if $y=-5 $ we have a log of negative number. 
Trying not to think about it, I proceed as follows: Exponentiation of both parts: $$y = e^{-1/2x^2-C}  - 4$$ 
And then:
$$y = e^{-1/2x^2}e^{-C} - 4$$ 
$$y = e^{-1/2x^2}C - 4$$ 
(this new $C $ to $e^{-C}$ and cannot be negative)
$$-5 = e^{0}C - 4$$
$$C=-1$$
(but we see that it is in fact negative under given initial conditions) which gives us the correct answer: $$y = -e^{-1/2x^2} - 4$$ Now I feel that I've cheated somewhere.

$$ i_pS(U) = \begin{cases} S & \text{if } \, p \in U \\ \{ e \} & \text{else} \, \end{cases} $$
is indeed a sheaf. Here's what I've tried so far. First I want to show the gluing axiom, so I take sections $a_i \in i_pS(U_i)$ such that $\res^{U_i}_{U_i \cap U_j} a_i = \res^{U_j}_{U_i \cap U_j} a_j$. We need for there to exist a section $a \in i_pS(U)$ such that $\res^U_{U_i}a = a_i$ for all $i \in I$. But here's my problem - since the sections are elements of the set (or abelian group) $S$, I'm not sure what the restriction of one of these sections actually is (as opposed to the clear nature of a restriction when we talk about, say, the sheaf of differentiable functions). I tried to do it case-wise, so say $p \in U_i$ and $p \notin U_j$ (so $p \notin U_i \cap U_j$) for example. Then $a_j \in \{e\}$ so $a_j =e$, and by our assumption, $\res^{U_i}_{U_i \cap U_j} a_i = e$ which means that $a_i$ is $e$ on the part of $U_i$ which overlaps with $U_j$. Does this mean that $a_i$ must be $e$ on the whole of $U_i$? I feel not, because then by this logic I think we would end up with $i_pS(U)= \{e \}$. But then if the $a_i$ take different values on different parts of $U$, how does one glue them together to construct a valid $a$, and what does this $a$ even look like? I haven't yet attempted the other axiom for sheaves, but I think I'd run into similar problems with the above reasoning.

I am currently working on cyclically symmetric structural mechanics and we exploit the finite group linear representation. In this theory, properties of rotation matrices are used, specifically the fact that for a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ of angle $2\pi/N$, $\mathbf{R}^{N} = \mathbf{I}$. Matrices such that $\mathbf{R}^{N} = \mathbf{0}$ are called nilpotent matrices, but is there a name for the mentioned rotation matrices ?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'terminology']"
2861153,How to compute the Fourier coefficients of $\exp(f(x))$ given the Fourier coefficients of $f(x)$,"In an attempt to solve a certain differential equation numerically with the Galerkin method I bumped into this problem: Given the real function $f(x) = \sum_{n = -N}^{N} a_n \, \exp(inx) $ compute the Fourier coefficients with indices between $-N$ and $N$ of the function $\exp(f(x))$. Of course the coefficients can be computed to any required accuracy by brute force numerical methods such as Gaussian Quadrature. In terms of computation time the $O(N^2)$ operations needed by the Gaussian quadrature are however to expensive in this case. What I am looking for is therefore a closed formula or algorithm for the coefficients such that the $2N+1$ coefficients can be computed with $O(N \log N)$ operations or less. Here is what I have tried: Let $b_p$ denote the $p$'th Fourier coefficient of $\exp(f(x))$. For notational convinience we will consider the coefficient $b_{-p}$, which can be calculated as $$b_{-p} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \exp(f(x)) \exp(ipx) \, dx. $$ Inserting the expansion for $f$ into this expression yields $$b_{-p} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \exp\bigg( \sum_{n = -N}^{N} a_n \exp(inx) \bigg) \exp(ipx) \, dx. $$ We now rewrite this as a contour integral along the unit circle in the complex plane. One parametrization of the unit circle is $\gamma(x) = \exp(ix)$ where $0 \le x \le 2 \pi$ and by definition of a complex contour integral we therefore have $$b_{-p} = - \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{\gamma} \exp\bigg( \sum_{n = -N}^{N} a_n z^n \bigg)  \, z^{p-1} dz. $$ By the residue theorem of Cauchy this integral is easily calculated if the residues of the function $\exp\bigg( \sum_{n = -N}^{N} a_n z^n \bigg)  \, z^{p-1}$ are known but this is where I get stuck. To get the residues I have tried to rewrite the exponential as $$ \exp\bigg( \sum_{n = -N}^{N} a_n z^n \bigg)  = \exp(a_{-N} z^{-N}) \exp(a_{-N+1} z^{-N+1}) \cdots \exp(a_{N-1} z^{N-1}) \exp(a_{N} z^{N}) $$ and then expanded each of the exponential functions as a Taylor series (the positive powers of $z$) or a Laurent series (the negative powers of $z$). This unfortunately creates a mess and I have not been able to extract a useful formula for $b_{-p}$ from it.","['complex-analysis', 'numerical-methods', 'fourier-analysis']"

2861217,Proof of the Symmetry Lemma,"I'm hoping someone can check that my proof of the Symmetry Lemma below is okay. (I'm actually proving a version of the result restricted to geodesic variations, because that's what I'm primarily interested in.) Note: I have seen the proof done with local coordinates, e.g., in John M. Lee's book; I want to avoid using coordinates. Let $\gamma : [0,T] \to M$ be a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, and let $\sigma : (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \times [0,T] \to M$, $(s,t) \mapsto \sigma(s,t)$ be a smooth geodesic variation of $\gamma$ (i.e., $\sigma(0,\cdot) = \gamma$, and $\sigma(s,\cdot)$ is a geodesic for every $s$). We can define vector fields along $\sigma$ as follows:
$$
  J(s,t) = T_{(s,t)}\sigma\cdot\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\right|_{(s,t)}
         =: \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial s}(s,t)
 \quad\text{and}\quad
  Z(s,t) = T_{(s,t)}\sigma\cdot\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{(s,t)}
         =: \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial t}(s,t).
$$
(Here $s$ is the coordinate on $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$, and $t$ is that on $[0,T]$.) So we have $\dot{\gamma} = Z(0,\cdot)$, and $J(0,\cdot)$ is a Jacobi field along $\gamma$. Claim: $\frac{D}{ds}Z = \frac{D}{dt}J$. Proof : Let $\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z} \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ be (smooth) extensions of $J$ and $Z$, resp., to an open neighbourhood of $\sigma$, i.e., $\widetilde{J}(\sigma(s,t)) = J(s,t)$ and $\widetilde{Z}(\sigma(s,t)) = Z(s,t)$. Since $\partial/\partial s$ and $\widetilde{J}$ are $\sigma$-related, likewise $\partial/\partial t$ and $\widetilde{Z}$, we then get that
$$
  [\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z}]\circ\sigma
    = T\sigma\cdot\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial s},\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right]
    = 0.
$$
Thus, since the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ is symmetric:
\begin{align*}
  0 & = T(J(s,t),Z(s,t))\\
    & = T(\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z})(\sigma(s,t))\\
    & = \nabla_{\widetilde{J}}\widetilde{Z}(\sigma(s,t)) - \nabla_{\widetilde{Z}}\widetilde{J}(\sigma(s,t)) - [\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z}](\sigma(s,t))\\
    & = \nabla_{J(s,t)}(\widetilde{Z}\circ\sigma) - \nabla_{Z(s,t)}(\widetilde{J}\circ\sigma)\\
      & = \frac{D}{ds}Z(s,t) - \frac{D}{dt}J(s,t).
\end{align*}
(End of proof.) My main concern with this argument is the existence of the extensions $\widetilde{J}$ and $\widetilde{Z}$ (and hence that $[\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z}]\circ\sigma = 0$). Clearly they won't exist on the entire image of $\sigma$, but if we restrict to a sufficiently small open subset $A \subset (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \times [0,T]$, then can we be assured that they exist on $\sigma(A)$? (Everything else in the proof seems okay to me, but I could be mistaken.) Edit: my claim was originally written incorrectly ($J$ and $Z$ were on the wrong sides); I've corrected this.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
2861228,"Given continuous $f:\{0,1\}^S\to[0,1]$ with S uncountable and $f(\sigma)=1$, show that $f(\tau)=1$ for some $\tau\neq\sigma$","Let $S$ be an uncountable set and consider the space $\{0,1\}^S$ under the product topology where $\{0,1\}$ is discrete. Let $f:\{0,1\}^S\to[0,1]$ be a continuous function and suppose $f(\sigma)=1$ for some $\sigma\in\{0,1\}^S$. I need to show that $f(\tau)=1$ for some $\tau\in\{0,1\}^S\setminus\{\sigma\}$. My first instinct was to take note of the cardinalities. Since $S$ is uncountable, $\{0,1\}^S$ has a cardinality of at least $2^{\aleph_1}$ whereas $[0,1]$ has a cardinality of only $2^{\aleph_0}$, so $f$ cannot be injective. Furthermore, every nonempty basis element in the product topology is a product of subsets of $\{0,1\}$ uncountably many of which must be $\{0,1\}$. So, every nonempty basis element, and therefore every nonempty open set in $\{0,1\}^S$, must have a cardinality of at least $2^{\aleph_1}$. Since $f$ is continuous, $(a,1]$ is open in $[0,1]$, and $f(\sigma)=1$, $\ f^{-1}(a,1]$ must have a cardinality of at least $2^{\aleph_1}$, so $f$ cannot be one-to-one on any interval containing $1$. In fact, for any interval $(a,1]$, there must exist $b\in(a,1]$ such that $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is uncountable. My problem is that I have no idea how to use this to conclude that $f^{-1}(\{1\})$ contains more than just $\sigma$. Another potentially useful thing is that $\{0,1\}^S$ is compact since it is a product of compact sets which means the Extreme Value Theorem applies here.",['general-topology']
2861229,Question on the space of probability measures,"Define the total variation norm in the space of probability measures $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by 
$$
\Vert \mu - \nu \Vert = \sup_D\lbrace | \mu(D) - \nu(D)| \rbrace.

I am to show that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, I find a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $\Vert \mu - \nu \Vert < \delta$, there are measures $\tau, \mu', \nu'$ such that
\begin{align*}
\mu &= (1-\varepsilon)\tau + \varepsilon \mu', \\
\nu &= (1- \varepsilon)\tau + \varepsilon \nu'.

It would suffice to show that there is a $\tau$ such that $\mu, \nu \geq (1-\varepsilon)\tau$. I have tried doing this by choosing $\tau$ as the center of a ball of diameter $\delta$ containing $\mu$ and $\nu$ so that $(1-\varepsilon)\tau$ would then drop too far from the ball, causing the inequality, but this obviously isn't working since $\tau$ can be very close to $0$ and the difference between $(1 - \varepsilon)\tau$ and $\tau$ would be insignificant compared to $\delta$. Playing with minimums of $\mu(D), \nu(D)$ isn't working either since I can't build a $\sigma$-additive measure by combining them.

$$T_C := \inf \{t \ge 0: B_t = C\}.$$ I am interested in the reversal of the Brownian motion from the first hitting time $T_C$, i.e. a description of the distribution of the path
$$(B_{T_C - s} - C)_{s \le T_C}.$$ My question is whether this has the same law as

where $(\widetilde{B}_s)_{s \ge 0}$ is a Brownian motion conditioned to stay non-positive, and $S_{-C}$ is the last time that the process $(B_s)$ hits $-C$. My guess above comes from the analogous problem for Brownian motion with negative drift. I was told that the following is true (I would appreciate a reference for that): Fix $m > 0$ and $C > 0$ as before. Let $T_C$ (resp. $S_{-C}$) be the first hitting time of $C$ (resp. last hittimg time of $-C$) of the Brownian motion with negative drift $(B_s -ms)_{s \ge 0}$. Then
  $$(B_{T_C - s} + m(T_C - s) - C)_{s \le T_C} \overset{d}{=} (\widetilde{B}_s - ms)_{s \le S_{-C}}$$
  where $(\widetilde{B}_s - ms)_{s \ge 0}$ is a Brownian motion with drift $-m$ conditioned to stay non-positive. As a heuristic I can send $m \to 0$ and that would recover my claim above, but this does not constitute a mathematical proof.

Suppose $$-\infty \leq \alpha \leq \beta \leq +\infty.$$ Then there exists a rearrangement $\sum a_n^\prime$ with partial sums $s_n^\prime$ such that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\inf s_n^\prime = \alpha, \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ \ \ \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup s_n^\prime = \beta. \tag{24}$$ Here's the proof: Let $$p_n = \frac{|a_n| + a_n}{2}, \ q_n = \frac{|a_n| - a_n}{2} \ (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots). $$ Then $p_n - q_n = a_n$ , $p_n + q_n = |a_n|$ , $p_n \geq 0$ , $q_n \geq 0$ . The series $\sum p_n$ , $\sum q_n$ must both diverge. For if both were convergent, then $$\sum \left( p_n + q_n \right) = \sum |a_n|$$ would converge, contrary to hypothesis. Since $$ \sum_{n=1}^N a_n = \sum_{n=1}^N \left( p_n - q_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^N p_n - \sum_{n=1}^N q_n,$$ divergence of $\sum p_n$ and convergence of $\sum q_n$ (or vice versa) implies divergence of $\sum a_n$ , again contrary to hypothesis. Now let $P_1, P_2, P_3, \ldots$ denote the non-negative terms of $\sum a_n$ , in the order in which they occur, and let $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \ldots$ be the absolute values of the negative terms of $\sum a_n$ , also in their original order. The series $\sum P_n$ , $\sum Q_n$ differ from $\sum p_n$ , $\sum q_n$ only by zero terms, and are therefore divergent. We shall construct sequences $\{m_n \}$ , $\{k_n\}$ , such that the series $$ P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} - Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} + \cdots \tag{25}, $$ which clearly is a rearrangement of $\sum a_n$ , satisfies (24). Choose real-valued sequences $\{ \alpha_n \}$ , $\{ \beta_n \}$ such that $\alpha_n \rightarrow \alpha$ , $\beta_n \rightarrow \beta$ , $\alpha_n < \beta_n$ , $\beta_1 > 0$ . Let $m_1$ , $k_1$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} > \beta_1,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} < \alpha_1;$$ let $m_2$ , $k_2$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} > \beta_2,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} - Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} < \alpha_2;$$ and continue in this way. This is possible since $\sum P_n$ , $\sum Q_n$ diverge. If $x_n$ , $y_n$ denote the partial sums of (25) whose last terms are $P_{m_n}$ , $-Q_{k_n}$ , then $$ | x_n - \beta_n | \leq P_{m_n}, \ \ \ |y_n - \alpha_n | \leq Q_{k_n}. $$ Since $P_n \rightarrow 0$ , $Q_n \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ , we see that $x_n \rightarrow \beta$ , $y_n \rightarrow \alpha$ . Finally, it is clear that no number less than $\alpha$ or greater than $\beta$ can be a subsequential limit of the partial sums of (25) . I don't understand the last two lines of the proof (put in bold). I'm aware that this question was already asked on this forum, but I didn't understand the answers provided in this question, so that's why I'm writing my own question.

2861487,"How does one complexify a real $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$?","If $V$ is a real vector space, then the complexification of $V$ is formally defined as $V^{\mathbb{C}}=V\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}$. Is there an analogous complexification operation for a real $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$? Idea: The notion of complexification for Lie groups exists, so perhaps one can ""complexify"" a real Riemannian manifold by realizing it as a Lie group (or the quotient of one). It seems that under complexification of a real manifold some additional information must be added to determine a complex structure. The reason I ask this is because I am looking through the Riemannian holonomy section of this article and it states that ""the complexified holonomies $SO(n,\mathbb{C})$, $G_2(\mathbb{C})$, and $Spin(7,\mathbb{C})$ may be realized from complexifying real analytic Riemannian manifolds.""

2861557,Proof on positive sequence with $\limsup_{n} a_n^{1/n}=1$ and $\liminf_{n}a_n^{1/n} <1$,"Does a positive sequence $\{a_n\}$ with $\limsup_{n} a_n^{1/n}=1$ and $\liminf_{n}a_n^{1/n} <1$ must have a subsequence $\{a_{n_i}\}$ satisfying $\lim_{i} a_{n_i}^{1/n_i}=1$ and $\lim_{i} |a_{n_i}^2-a_{n_i-1}a_{n_i+1}|^{1/n_i}=1$. So Here are the hypothesis:
\begin{equation} \limsup_{n} a_{n}^{1/n}=1 \tag1 \end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation} \liminf_{n} a_{n}^{1/n}<1 \tag2 \end{equation}
How to derive the conclusion: there is a subsequence $\{a_{n_i}\}$ fulfilling both of
\begin{equation} \lim_{i} a_{n_i}^{1/n_i}=1 \tag3 \end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \lim_{i} |a_{n_i}^2-a_{n_i-1}a_{n_i+1}|^{1/n_i}=1 \tag4 \end{equation} My understanding to this problem It is obvious that $(1)$ implies $(3)$, but how $(1)$ together with $(2)$ imply $(3)$ and $(4)$ is not so clear, although trivial examples such as
$$1,\delta^2,1,\delta^4,\cdots,1,\delta^{2n},\cdots$$
(where $0<\delta<1$) strongly support this proposition. Given $(3)$ holds, $(4)$ may be replaced with the equivalent
\begin{equation}\lim_{i} \left|1-\frac{a_{n_i+1}}{a_{n_i}} \frac{a_{n_i-1}}{a_{n_i}}\right|^{1/n_i} =1 \end{equation} So this suggests that $\dfrac{a_{n_i+1}}{a_{n_i}} \dfrac{a_{n_i-1}}{a_{n_i}}$ must be ""small"" enough. It seems somehow related to the ratio test vs the root test in convergence of series.

2861612,"exponential of second derivative, not positive?","I'm interested in whether the following function $h(x,y)=e^{\partial_x\partial_y}f(x)g(y)$, is positive in the sense that $h(x,y)\geq 0$, whenever $f(x)\geq 0$ and $g(y)\geq 0$ (positive and real). I would have thought that it was positive because the derivatives are in the exponential, but it appears not to be. Any idea why it isn't positive? Maybe because ${\partial_x\partial_y}$ is not a normal operator? But I think it is even self-adjoint (or at least symmetric), so should have real eigenvalues. To see that it is not positive one can expand the exponential $h(x,y)=f(x)g(y)+f'(x)g'(y)+\frac{1}{2}f''(x)g''(y)+...$ and take (for example) $f(x)=x^2$ and $g(y)=y^2$. Then the series terminates at second order and is $(xy+2)^2-2$, which is negative at $x=-\sqrt{2}$, $y=\sqrt{2}$ etc. To see that $\partial_x\partial_y$ is symmetric we have $\int dx dy \psi^*(x,y)\partial_x\partial_y \phi(x,y)=\int dx dy \partial_x\partial_y \psi^*(x,y) \phi(x,y)$ after integrating by parts twice, plus a boundary term. So for the boundary term to vanish we should have that $\psi^*(x,y)$ is zero at infinity, so maybe  $e^{\partial_x\partial_y}f(x)g(y)$ is positive on functions which decay to zero  at infinity? This is not the case with polynomials which are the examples I know that give negative values.","['derivatives', 'exponential-function', 'functional-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra']"
2861616,Inner regular content is premeasure,"Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $\mu$ be a content on a semiring $\mathfrak{J}$ over $X$. Suppose that $\mu$ is inner regular, i.e., for every $\epsilon > 0$, $A \in \mathfrak{J}$, there is a $K\in \mathfrak{J}$ such that $\overline{K}$ is compact, $\overline{K} \subseteq A$ and $\mu(A)\leq \mu(K)+\epsilon$. I want to show that this implies that $\mu$ is a premeasure. My attempt: First of all, I showed that if $\mu$ is an inner regular content on $\mathfrak{J}$, then its extension to the ring $\mathfrak{R}$ (which I denote by $\mu$ as well) generated by $\mathfrak{J}$ is inner regular as well. This allows us to use the following lemma: Lemma: Let $\mu$ be a content on a ring $\mathfrak{R}$. If for every sequence $(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of sets in $\mathfrak{R}$ satisfying $\mu(A_1) < \infty$ and $A_n \downarrow \emptyset$ we have $\mu(A_n)\downarrow 0$, then $\mu$ is a premeasure on $\mathfrak{R}$. So, in order to use the lemma, let $A_n$ be defined as in the lemma. Take $K_n \in \mathfrak{R}$ such that $\overline{K_n}$ is compact, $\overline{K_n} \subseteq A_n$ and $\mu(A_n) \leq \mu(K_n) + \epsilon$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We have $$\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \overline{K_n} \subseteq \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n = \emptyset.$$
Due to the compactness of the $\overline{K_n}$, this means that the family $(\overline{K_n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ does not have the finite intersection property. Hence, there is a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
$$ \bigcap_{n=1}^{N} K_n \subseteq \bigcap_{n=1}^{N} \overline{K_n} = \emptyset.$$
I've tried to use $\cap_{n=1}^{N} A_{n} = A_{N}$ and estimate $\mu(\cap_{n=1}^{N} A_n)$ by something depending on $\mu(\cap_{n=1}^{N} K_n)$ plus something depending on epsilon, but without success. I've also tried to make the $K_n$ disjoint, that is, define $C_n := K_n \setminus \cup_{i=1}^{n-1}K_i$ and then use that $$\mu(A_1) \geq \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{N} C_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mu(C_n).$$ As $N$ was arbitrary, this shows that $\mu(C_n) \to 0$, but I've been unable to conclude from this.","['general-topology', 'borel-measures', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

$$\frac{\Gamma(x)}{2}(e^{\frac{i\pi}{2}x}+e^{\frac{-i\pi}{2}x})=\int_0^{\infty}u^{2x-1}(e^{iu^2}+e^{-iu^2})du$$ which is just $$\frac{\Gamma(x)}{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)=\int_0^{\infty}u^{2x-1}\cos(u^2)du$$ plugging $x=-\frac{1}{2}$ we get that$$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\cos(x^2)}{x^2}dx=-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$$ Well, obviously this integral diverges... But if Instead of summing we subtract we get that $$\frac{\Gamma(x)}{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}x)=\int_0^{\infty}u^{2x-1}\sin(u^2)du$$ simmilarly with $$x=-\frac12 \rightarrow \int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x^2)}{x^2}dx=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$$ So its not that completely garbage.

Show $*$ is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}^+$ . In our course on Abstract Algebra our book says the following in it. $*$ is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}^+$ . Because $*$ is well defined: if $(a, b) = (c, d)$ , then $a = c$ and $b=d$ . Hence we have $$*(a, b)= a+b = c+d = *(c, d)$$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is closed under $*$ . If $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ , then $a*b = a+b \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ The above seems wrong to me. I see two errors. Firstly if $*$ is a well-defined function then there is no need to show that $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is closed under $*$ and secondly they haven't actually shown well definedness of $*$ , since all they've done is just take two equal elements in $\mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+$ and shown their outputs are equal. Now the way I see it, all I have to show is that $* : \mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \mathbb{Z}^+$ defined by $$*(a, b) = a*b = a+b$$ is actually a well-defined function. To do this (in more familiar notation compared to the answer given here: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/313182/266135 ) I need to show the following $*(a, b) = a+b \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ for all $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+$ $\forall (x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+$ , there exists a $z \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $*(x, y) = x+y =z$ If $*(a, b) =c$ and $*(a, b)=d$ then $c=d$ . Now 1. above is satisfied easily since we know that by properties of the integers that the addition of any two positive integers is again a positive integer. Since 1. is satisfied 2. is redudant and there's nothing to prove (please correct me if I am wrong on this). So all that's left to prove is 3. To prove 3. all I'd need to do is suppose that $*(a, b) = c$ and $*(a, b) = d$ , then I'd have $a+b=c$ and $a+b=d$ , but then trivially I'd have $c=d$ (because if you add the same two positive integers $a, b$ together then you get the same unique result $a+b$ always).
