424518,"Prove that $\dim(X,\succsim)\leq|X^2|$ - A starting point for a journey into order theory","During the last week I kept on thinking about what looked an easy problem at a first glance. Let $(X,\succsim)$ be a preordered set, and define $\mathcal{L}(\succsim)$ as the set of all complete preorders that extend $\succsim$. Define $\dim(X,\succsim)$ as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\succsim = R_1 \cap \cdots \cap R_k$ for some $R_i \in \mathcal{L}(\succsim)$, with $i=1,\cdots,k$. Show that $\dim(X,\succsim)\leq|X^2|$. In order to attack the problem, first of all I took a look at $\dim(X,X^2)$ and $\dim(X,\Delta_X)$, where $\Delta_X$ is the diagonal relation. In this question I got a feedback on my conclusions: indeed $\dim(X,X^2)=1$ and $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$. The interesting case is $\dim(X,\Delta_X)$, because this is the one that gave me a bit of intuition on how to attack the problem that I present now. Given a $\Delta_X$, we have that $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$, because we can imagine all the elements of the diagonal relation (let's call them $x_1,\cdots,x_n$) separated. I literally imagine $n$ loops, one for each element, that are all unrelated. This is a preorder. In order to make it a complete preorder we start to connect them. Now, we can have in the family of complete preorders that extend the original preorder two complete preorders: - one in which all the arrows move from $x_1$ to $x_n$, - and another in which the arrows move in the opposite direction. Here, the direction of the arrows is not such a big problem, so it is without loss of generality. Interestingly, if we intersect those two complete preorders we come up with the original preorder. Thus, $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$. Focusing now on the original problem of $\dim(X,\succsim)\leq|X^2|$, I think that I have two problems: 1) I am not sure what the question is really about. Indeed, I think that - stricly speaking - the question is all about proving the (probably) trivial result that in principle $\dim(X,\succsim)$ cannot be bigger than $|X^2|$. So we should prove it by contradiction, coming up with the fact that $|X^2|$ represents the biggest possible numbers of connection we can have on a finite set. [Not sure, if I expressed this idea properly, so feel free to correct me] However, another possible way of looking as this problem is that what we really have to prove is that $|X^2|$ is the upper bound of $\dim(X,\succsim)$. And here, part of my problems get serious... 2) ...because I cannot see how it can be that $\dim(X,\succsim)>2$. This is the case even if I found myself downloading most of the papers written on the topic during the last fifty years (yep, I am kinda perfectionist, so when I do not understand, I find myself trying to read every possible paper on a topic... this is the case also because I am basically self-taught). So, the point here is that I cannot see how $\dim(X,\succsim)>2$, because I can apply the procedure I used to come up with $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$ basically always. In other words, I can always find a relation that completes another with some arrows, and another that completes the very same relation with arrows of the opposite direction, coming up with the intersection of the two complete relation equal to the original incomplete relation. In the end, sorry for this long post, for a probably easy question. I guess that some of my problems can be related to my idea of extension of a preorder or a poset. Anyway, I am positive about the fact that with your help I will find what my problems are all about. Looking forward to any feedback. Thanks in advance. PS: I add the tag of ""Graph Theory"", because I tried to use a lot of that kind of intuition to figure out what the problem is all about, and I am sure that having a feedback from that point of view on this issue can be really helpful (both from a pedagogical and theoretical perspective). Edit: I added the following picture in order to show what is the problem I still have, beyond kind and comprehensive Brian M.Scott's answer. Let's say this is an Hasse diagram of a poset, so let's try to focus on the dimension of posets instead of preorders, like in my original problem. In order to make this poset complete (so, to come up with a linear extension of it) I can add a connection that moves from $b$ to $c$ ($bRc$) and another from $a$ to $c$ ($aRc$). Let's call this linear extension $R_1$. Now, let's come up with a new linear extension that moves from the same Hasse diagram, but that has connections that move in the opposite directions (which means that we have $cRa$ and $cRb$). Let's call this new linear extension $R_2$. If we intersect the two linear extension we built up, the result is the original poset. What seems to me is that we can come up with this trick almost always... however, Brian M.Scott pointed me out that I should see this doesn't work even from $n=4$, where $n$ is the cardinality of the poset. Exactly, what am I missing that should be really obvious? I am really sorry for this late edit and by this dumb question, but I don't see how to solve this problem.
Really thanks a lot for any feedback.","['graph-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

424521,How useful are geometric aspects when studying finite groups?,"My newbie impression when studying finite group theory is that geometric aspects are not very prevalent. Cayley graphs play quite some role for visualising finite groups, but compared to the study of infinite groups in geometric group theory, geometric aspects seem to be marginal. I therefore wonder: (1) Why is geometry less interesting when studying finite groups (if this is really the case)? (2) Could it (nevertheless) be interesting to delve into geometric group theory when studying finite groups? I find GGT particularly interesting, but as I am currently working in finite group theory I am not sure how advisable it is to hope for connections. Finite groups are special cases of finitely generated infinite groups, but I am not sure if these are uninteresting cases from the GGT viewpoint. Thank you for any clarifications and hints!","['geometric-group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
424530,Is this similarity to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function real?,"Mathematica knows that the logarithm of $n$ is: $$\log(n) = \lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1} \zeta(s)\left(1 - \frac{1}{n^{(s - 1)}}\right)$$ The von Mangoldt function should then be: $$\Lambda(n)=\lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1} \zeta(s)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{(s-1)}}.$$ Setting the first term of the von Mangoldt function $\Lambda(1)$ equal to the harmonic number $H_{\operatorname{scale}}$ where scale is equal to the scale of the Fourier transform matrix, one can calculate the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function with the Mathematica program at the link below: http://pastebin.com/ZNNYZ4F6 In the program I studied the function within the limit for the von Mangoldt function, and made some small changes to the function itself: $f(t)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{n=k} \frac{1}{\log(k)} \frac{1}{n} \zeta(1/2+i \cdot t)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{(1/2+i \cdot t-1)}}$
as $k$ goes to infinity. (Edit 20.9.2013: The function $f(t)$ had ""-1"" in the argument for the zeta function.) The plot of this function looks like this: While the plot of the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function with the program looks like this: There are some similarities but the Fourier transform converges faster towards smaller oscillations in between the spikes at zeta zeros and the scale factor is wrong. Will the function $f(t)$ above eventually converge to the Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function, or is it only yet another meaningless plot? Now when I look at it I think the spikes at zeros comes from the zeta function itself and the spectrum like feature comes from the MÃ¶bius function which inverts the zeta function. In the Fourier transform the von Mangoldt function has this form: $$\log (\text{scale}) ,\log (2),\log (3),\log (2),\log (5),0,\log (7),\log (2),\log (3),0,\log (11),0,...,\Lambda(\text{scale})$$ $$scale = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...k$$ Or as latex: $$\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \log q & \text{if }n=1, \\\log p & \text{if }n=p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and integer } k \ge 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ $$n=1,2,3,4,5,...q$$ TableForm[Table[Table[If[n == 1, Log[q], MangoldtLambda[n]], {n, 1, q}],

Let $+:\mathbb{N} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be defined by$ c+d=f_{c}(d)$ for all $c,d\in \mathbb{N}$. Let $n,m\in \mathbb {N}$.

My instinct says ""no"" because of the remarks at the top of page 95 in Hartshorne: ""The rough idea is that in order for a schemes $X$ to be separated, it should not contain any subscheme which looks like a curve with a doubled point...""  So if $X$ is not separated, it contains such a subscheme, and thus so should the product $X\times_S Y$. I tried proving the claim using the valuative criterion, and I think I was able to do it. Unfortunately, I don't know how to typeset diagrams here (it seems xymatrix is not supported), but the idea is to take 2 of the different morphisms from $T$ to $X$ (using the notation of Hartshorne here in which $T = \text{Spec}(R)$ for a valuation ring $R$) and make them morphisms to the product. Unless I overlooked something, the proof was pretty simple. Is all this correct or are there counter-examples out there? EDIT : As pointed out by Martin Brandenburg below, in general, the product of non-separated schemes could be separated. However, I think it is true that if the schemes are all over some field $k$ then non-separated-ness is preserved under taking products.

Given a collection $S$ of subsets of $X$, a premeasure $\mu$ is a map $\mu :S \rightarrow \left [ 0, \infty  \right ]  $ for which $\mu\left (\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{n} E_{k}  \right ) = \sum \limits_{k=1}^{n} \mu\left ( E_k \right )$ whenever the $E_k \in S$ are disjoint and $\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{n} E_{k}  \in S$ and $\mu\left ( E \right ) \leqslant \sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu\left ( E_k \right )$ whenever $E, E_k \in S$ with $ E \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{n} E_{k}   $ and for which $\mu\left(\emptyset\right ) = 0$ if $\emptyset \in S$ . Then, the following theorem gets proven (I get all that): Let $\mu :S \rightarrow \left [ 0, \infty  \right ]  $ be a premeasure on a semiring $S$ of subsets of $X$. Then the CarathÃ©odory measure $\bar{\mu}$ induced by $\mu$ is an extension of $\mu$. Furthermore, if $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then $\bar{\mu}$ is the unique measure on the $\sigma$-algebra of CarathÃ©odory measurable sets that extends $\mu$. What I don't understand is why the following is a corollary of this theorem: Let $S$ be a semiring of subsets of $X$ and $\mathcal{B}$ the smallest $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$ that contains $S$. Then two $\sigma$-finite measures on $\mathcal{B}$ are equal if and only if they agree on $S$ . What am I missing? Any thoughts anyone? Many thanks in advance.",['measure-theory']

  $$\lim_{\substack{x\rightarrow x_0 \\ x\in M}} \int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{-1}{||y-x||} dS_y = \lim_{\substack{x\rightarrow x_0 \\ x\in M}} \int_{\partial M} \frac{n_y \cdot (y-x)}{||y-x||^4}   dS_y  = \infty$$ The condition on $\partial M$ is free to choose. So suppose that it is smooth as much as you need. But ideally I would like to prove it for piece wise $C^1$ surface. So has anybody idea how to show this limit? Edit: Ok my best shot when $\partial M$ is convex. But I can't prove it yet, I'm experiencing the same problem as when I show that $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^\alpha} dt$ diverge(for $\alpha > 1 $) by this technique: $$ \int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^\alpha} dt \geq \int_0^x \frac{1}{t^\alpha} dt \geq \frac{x}{x^\alpha} \rightarrow \infty$$ as $x$ goes to zero. But IT doesn't work for $\alpha =1$ yet the integral diverge. So here goes my try, I need two lemmas about convex surfaces. Lemma1: It is bound on how big can be angle between $n_y$ and $y-x$. Let $\partial M$ is convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Than for every $x$ in interior of $\partial M$ ie $x\in M$. This inequality holds:
  $$ \forall y\in \partial M: n_y\cdot \frac{y-x}{\|y-x\|} \geq \frac{\min_{z\in \partial M} \|x-z\|}{\max_{z\in \partial M} \|x-z\|}\geq \frac{\text{dist}(x,\partial M)}{\text{diam}(\partial M)}$$
  $n_y$ is outer normal at point $y$ This lemma is quite straight forward just draw a picture in 2d and you'll see it. Lemma2: This is bound on how small can get and surface area of convex surface at vicinity of some point $x$ Let $\partial M$ is convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $x$ is point in interior of $\partial M$ ie $x\in M$. Denote $\rho = \text{dist}(x,\partial M) = \text{dist}(x,x_0)$ for some $x_0 \in \partial M$. Than:
  $$\int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,2\rho)} 1 \, dS \geq \alpha_{n-1} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \rho \right)^{n-1} $$
  where $\alpha_n$ is volume of unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Again draw this in 2d and you'll see it. Maybe I will add pictures if I find out how. Now to the limit:"" denote $\rho = \text{dist}(x,\partial M)=\|x-x_0\|$, $D = \text{diam}(\partial M)$ $$ \int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{-1}{||y-x||} dS_y  = \int_{\partial M} \frac{n_y \cdot (y-x)}{||y-x||^4}   dS_y  \geq$$ $$ \int_{\partial M} \frac{n_y \cdot (y-x)}{||y-x||^4}   dS_y  \geq \int_{\partial M} \frac{\rho  \|y-x\|}{D\|y-x\|^4}   dS_y \geq $$ $$ \int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,2\rho)} \frac{\rho  \|y-x\|}{D\|y-x\|^4}   dS_y \geq \int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,2\rho)} \frac{\rho^2}{D 2^4 \rho^4}   dS_y \geq$$ $$ \frac{\rho^2}{D 2^4 \rho^4} \int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,2\rho)} dS_y \geq \frac{\rho^2}{D 2^4 \rho^4}  \pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \rho \right)^{2} = \frac{1}{D 2^4 }  \pi \frac{3}{4}$$ But that does not got to infinity :(( I have one minor interesting observation.

I found the possible closed form using an integer relation algorithm. I found several other possible forms for similar integrals, including
$$ \int_0^1 \frac{du}{u}\text{Li}_2(u)^2(\log u)^2 \stackrel{?}{=} -20\zeta(7)+12\zeta(2)\zeta(5).$$ There doesn't seem to be an equivalent form when the integrand contains $(\log u)^3$, at least not just in terms of $\zeta$. Does anybody know a trick for evaluating these integrals? Update. The derivation of the closed form for the second integral follows easily along the ideas O.L. used in the answer for the first integral. Introduce the functions
$$ I(a,b,c) = \int_0^1 \frac{du}{u}(\log u)^c \text{Li}_a(u)\text{Li}_b(u) $$
and
$$ S(a,b,c) = \sum_{n,m\geq1} \frac{1}{n^am^b(n+m)^c}. $$
Using integration by parts, the expansion of polylogarithms from their power series definition and also that
$$ \int_0^1 (\log u)^s u^{t-1}\,du = \frac{(-1)^s s!}{t^{s+1}},$$
check that
$$ I(2,2,2) = -\frac23 I(1,2,3) = 4S(1,2,4). $$ Now use binomial theorem and the fact that $S(a,b,c)=S(b,a,c)$ to write
$$ 6S(1,2,4) + 2S(3,0,4) = 3S(1,2,4) + 3S(2,1,4)+S(0,3,4)+S(3,0,4) = S(3,3,1). $$
Now, using Mathematica, 
$$ S(3,3,1) = \sum_{n,m\geq1}\frac{1}{n^3m^3(n+m)} = \sum_{m\geq1}\frac{H_m}{m^6} - \frac{\zeta(2)}{m^5} + \frac{\zeta(3)}{m^4}, $$
and
$$ \sum_{m\geq1}\frac{H_m}{m^6} = -\zeta(4)\zeta(3)-\zeta(2)\zeta(5)+4\zeta(7), $$
so
$$ S(3,3,1) = 4\zeta(7)-2\zeta(2)\zeta(5). $$ Also,
$$ S(0,3,4) = \zeta(3)\zeta(4) - \sum_{m\geq1} \frac{H_{n,4}}{m^3} = -17\zeta(7)+10\zeta(2)\zeta(5)+\zeta(3)\zeta(4), $$
from which it follows that
$$ I(2,2,2) = \frac23\left(S(3,3,1)-2S(0,3,4)\right) = -20\zeta(7)+12\zeta(2)\zeta(5). $$","['closed-form', 'sequences-and-series', 'integration', 'harmonic-numbers']"

Then I called $x_{n}=(\frac{2n+5}{7n+6})^{\log(n+1)}$, Instead of computing $\lim_{n \to \infty}x_{n}$, I computed first $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\log(x_{n})=\lim_{n \to \infty}\log(n)\log\left(\frac{2n+5}{7n+6}\right)=\log(\frac{2}{7})\lim_{n \to \infty}\log(n)=-\infty,$$ therefore: $\lim_{n \to \infty}x_{n}=\lim_{n \to \infty}e^{\log(x_{n})}=0$.

The contraction mapping theorem is a basic tool for proving existence of, and finding solutions to, equations. Given an algebraic (read: not differential) equation $f(x)=0$ where $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is sufficiently smooth, often it is possible prove that the mapping
\begin{equation}
\Phi_f(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}
\end{equation} is a contraction on some complete metric space by restricting $x$ to an interval. This yields existence of a solution to the original equation. This is Newton's method , which has both theoretical and practical significance. Consider the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)$. The Picard mapping
\begin{equation*}
\Psi(\phi)(t) = \mathbf{x}_0 + \int_0^t \mathbf{v}(\phi(\tau),\tau) \; d\tau
\end{equation*}
is a contraction on a function space, under suitable conditions on $\mathbf{v}$ . This yields an existence result for the given ODE with data $\mathbf{x}_0$. A very similar map appears in the study of certain nonlinear partial differential equations (e.g. Duhamel's principle applied to semilinear equations). Contrasted with the numerical solution of an algebraic equation, the contraction in these cases isn't of much practical use. Clearly the derivative is useful for proving existence of algebraic equations, and similarly for the integral and differential equations.

Can someone tell me where I've gone wrong? The statement is as follows.  Let $\phi : A \rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism, let $X = \text{Spec } A$ and $Y = \text{Spec } B$, and let $f : Y \rightarrow X$ be the induced map.  Then $\phi$ is injective if and only if the map of sheaves $f^{\#} : \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow f_{\ast} \mathcal{O}_Y$ is injective. My counterexample is as follows.  Let $A = k[x]$ and $B = k[x,y]/(xy)$, and let $\phi : A \hookrightarrow B$ be the obvious injection.  Then I claim that the associated map of sheaves is not injective.  Indeed, let $p = (x) \in \text{Spec } B$ (this is a prime ideal since $B/(x) \cong k[y]$ is a domain) and $q = (x) \in \text{Spec } A$.  Then $f(p) = q$.  But the induced map of stalks $A_q \rightarrow B_p$ is not injective; indeed, $\frac{x}{1} \in A_q$ is nonzero but $\frac{x}{1} \in B_p$ is zero since in $B_p$ we have $\frac{x}{1} = \frac{xy}{y} = 0$.",['algebraic-geometry']

This vector space has a countably infinite dimension. When $f$ is expressed as linear combination of the basis vector the scalar multiple for the $n$-th basis vector is $\operatorname{Diff}_n{f}(a)/n!$ Fourier series expansion of function, $f$, is a vector in the vector space with basis: $\{\sin(1x), \cos(1x), \sin(2x), \cos(2x), \ldots, \sin(nx), \cos(nx), \ldots\}$. This vector space has a countably infinite dimension. When $f$ is expressed as linear combination of the basis vector the scalar multiple for the $n$-th basis vectors are $\operatorname{Int}\{f\cdot\sin(nx)\}$ and $\operatorname{Int}\{f\cdot\cos(nx)\}$. Questions: The vector space for the Fourier series has an inner product, $\operatorname{Int}\{f\cdot g\}$, and it's this inner product that provides the above expressions like $\operatorname{Int}\{f\cdot\sin(nx)\}$ and $\operatorname{Int}\{f\cdot\cos(nx)\}$. Is there a similar inner product based derivation of the scalar multiples for the vector space of spanned by the polynomial basis in Taylor series? What is the relationship, if any, between the vector space produced by Taylor Series and that of Fourier Series? E.g. is one a subspace of the other? When Fourier series is taught, why isn't Taylor Series re-explained in the vector space framework used for Fourier series? And would this approach not lead the discussion of the implication of the choice of basis (and perhaps the choice of inner product) for function spaces?

Then $A$ is sequentially closed, that is: If $(x_n) \subset A$ and $x_n \xrightarrow{w}x$, then $x \in A$. I know this characterisation is also used as definition of weakly closed. So I guess it should be easy to prove. Yet I have trouble doing so. ;( I tried proving it directly and towards a contradiction without success. I'm afraid my problem is a lack of understanding of weak closedness. I know how weakly open sets are generated, but this doesn't give me a concrete representation them, or of a weakly closed subset. However, I know that $A$ is also closed with respect to the norm of $X$. Weak convergence of $(x_n)$ to $x$ means $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$ for every $f \in X^*$. But it doesn't give me any statement related to the norm convergence of $(x_n)$, at least not that I know of. So the norm-closedness of $A$ doesn't really help. I could also find out that norm closedness is not sufficient for closedness with respect to weak convergence - I think convexivity has to be added to make the implication valid, is that correct? So of course I have to fail if I weak convergence with norm convergence alone. I've tried to work with balls around $f(x)$, too (for a contradiction). But again, the continuousness of $f$ only gives me control over $|f(x_n)-f(x)|$ if I have some bound for $||x_n-x||$. And I want it the other way around. I have a feeling that this way is wrong because it would need some implication between weak and norm convergence that I know isn't there...

425176,Real points of a complex curve,"Since the ""real points"" of a complex curve can mean a couple of different things, bear with me while I'm annoyingly formal here. Consider first a cubic curve $y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$.  Write $$S := \{ [x:y:z] \in \mathbb{C}P^2 \; | \; y^2 z = x^3 + a x z^2 + b z^3 \}$$ and $$C := \{ [x:y:z] \; | \; x, y, z \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } [x:y:z] \in S \}.$$ For generic values of $a$ and $b$, we can regard $S$ and a real 2-manifold and $C$ as a one-dimensional submanifold of $C$.  Thus in particular $C$ determines an element of $H_1(S, \mathbb{Z})$.  Which element, and is there a nice way to see this?

425226,Finding the fallacy in this broken proof,"Today, a friend gave me a ""proof"" of $1=2$ and challenged me to find the fallacy. $1 = 1$ $1 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 ...$ $1 = 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...$ $1 = 2 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...$ $1 = 2 + 0 + 0 ...$ $1 = 2$ My answer was that once you turn the initial $1 + 1$ into a 2, everything is offset so a $-1$ is always left at the end no matter how many times it is repeated. This negative one balances out the $2$ at the beginning so $1=1$ still holds true. I.e. $$1 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 ... = 1 + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) = 2 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) - 1$$ However, my friend claimed that my answer only applies if the $+ 1 - 1$ repeats for a finite number of times. He argues that because the sequence repeats infinitely and things work differently when working with infinity, my answer is not valid.

425256,On Applications of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule,"The question is located below. In short, I am looking for an accessible explanation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule in relation to the following problem . Pardon the long setup. Let $Y$ be a standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$. At the risk of being pedantic, standard here means $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\lambda_n$ and the entries are strictly increasing rightward along rows and downard along columns (with each number occuring only once). Let $f_\lambda$ denote the number of standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda$. It is well known that $f_\lambda$ can be calculated via the Hook formula: $$f_\lambda=\frac{|\lambda|!}{\prod_{i,j}h(i,j)}.$$ Now suppose I remove some boxes on the outer edge of the tableau (i'll call this a pattern from now on), giving a shape $\delta_i$ (I'll explain the $i$ in a moment). Here's an example: let $\lambda$ be the triangular tableau $(n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. Now I want to remove three adjacent boxes in an ""L"" shape: Here I've indexed the location of the left box as $i$ which gives the $x$ coordinate of the box ($i=3$ in this example). Again, I'm calling the new tableau of shape $\delta_i$, and one easily finds $f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda$ as the ratio of the particular hooks that change. I'm interested in the following. In the above example, I removed three adjacent boxes at location $i$. I want to evaluate sums of the form: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\frac{f_{\delta_i}}{f_\lambda}$$. In full generality, I am interested in removing any pattern of boxes indexed by $i$ (the sum's range changes appropriately depending on the pattern). Going along with my example, one can show that $$f_{\delta_i}/f_\lambda=\frac{1}{3N(N-1)(N-2)}a_ia_{n-i-1},$$ where $N:=\binom{n}{2}$ and $a_i:=\frac{(2i+1)!!}{(2i-2)!!}$. One can then evaluate the sum using relatively straightforward generating functions for $a_i$, giving a tidy answer of $1/N$. Question: I have heard that calculating $\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\frac{f_{\delta_i}}{f_\lambda}$ can be done via the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. In particular, I've been told my $L$ example gives $-\frac{\chi^{\lambda}(\pi)}{\chi^\lambda(\mbox{id})}$ where $\pi$ is a 3-cycle. Can someone provide an accessible reference for this rule in the context above? I am not an expert in representation theory and the usual references I've seen ( Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol II by Stanley) are somewhat beyond me at the moment (and in much greater generality). In short, I am looking for an accessible explanation of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.","['representation-theory', 'characters', 'integer-partitions', 'symmetric-groups', 'combinatorics']"

425306,Guess the birthday,"I've come across the following little quiz game problem, which I've failed to solve. Say we have $15$ people, each of them of different age, and you want to guess their actual birthday - not just their age. You are allowed to guess as many times as you want, but the guessing goes as follows: Choose $5$ random people from the group. Each of them gives you four distinct possible dates, which they have chosen before the quiz started (so they will not change their options later in the game). One of these is correct. When you have guessed on the date for all five, they will tell you how many correct guesses, you had. They will not tell you which guesses were correct. Now the questions are: What is the probability to guess one specific person's birthday in the first try? How many times would you expect, you have to guess to get one person's birthday right? How many times would you expect, you have to guess to get all $15$ people's birthday right? What is the probability to get one person's birthday right in less than $200$ guesses? What is the probability to get all the people's birthday right in less than $3000$ guesses? The first question was rather easy to answer. When you pick randomly, you have to pick the person, whose birthday you would like to know, the probability of this is $\dfrac{1}{3}$, since we pick $\dfrac{1}{3}$ of the people in the group. To know one person's birthday for sure in the first try, you will have to answer his question correct. But as you will not know which question, you answered correct, when you ask, unless you answered all of them correct, you will have to answer correct, which has the probability $\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)^5 = \dfrac{1}{1024}$.
So the answer to the first question is $\dfrac{1}{3072}$. To solve the next questions, I've tried to assume that we only have $5$ people, and that they are always chosen. This gives me a strategy to find one specific person's birthday, since I can just alter my answers to his question, and after maximum four guesses, I've guessed his birthday.
Unfortunately, I cannot be sure that he will come up every time, I ask. Actually, I cannot be sure that he will ever come up, but I ""only"" have to find the expected amount of guesses. And this is where I got stuck. Any help in tackle this question will be so much appreciated! Hints or even solutions, anything.

425321,Proof of Galois' theorem that there exists a field of $p^n$ elements.,"From Galois Theory (Rotman): For every prime p and every positive integer n, there exists a field having exactly $p^n$ elements. Proof. If there were a field K with $|K| = p^n = q$ , then $K^* = K - \{0\}$ would be a multiplicative group of order q-1; by Lagrange's theorem $a^{q-1}=1$ for all $a \in K^*$ . It follows that every element of K would be a root of the polynomial $$g(x)=x^q - x.$$ We now begin the construction. By Kronecker's theorem, there is a field E containing $\Bbb{Z}_p$ over which g(x) splits. Define $F = \{\alpha \in E: g(\alpha)=0\}$ ; that is, F is the set of all the roots of g(x). Since the derivative $g'(x)=qx^{q-1} - 1 = -1$ (because $q=p^n$ and E has characteristic p), Lemma 32 shows that the gcd (g,g')=1, and so g(x) has no repeated roots; that is, $|F|=q=p^n$ . We claim that F is a field, which will complete the proof... I am a bit confused with this proof, because in order to show that F is a field with exactly $p^n$ elements, we are assuming that there exists a field K of order $p^n$ . But isn't that what we are supposed to prove in the first place? In other words, how can we assume that there exists a field K of order $p^n$ for every p and n? And if we are allowed to assume that, then isn't the proof already complete?","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'extension-field', 'abstract-algebra']"

Since $c_{\rm max}\geq c_1$ : $|x_0| \leq \left(n\dfrac{c_{\rm max}}{|c_1|}\right)^{1/n}\leq n\dfrac{c_{\rm max}}{|c_1|} \leq (n+1) \dfrac{c_{\rm max}}{|c_1|}$ .

= y \end{cases}$$ Is the sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ defined by $x_n = \frac{1}{n}$ convergent in this metric space? Is this metric space complete? For part 1: Assume that $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is convergent to a real $a$. Then, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that: $$d(x_n, a) < \epsilon ~ ~ \text{for all} ~ ~ n \geq N$$ Let $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$. Then $d(x_n, a) < \frac{1}{2} ~ ~ \implies ~ ~ x_n = a ~ ~ \implies ~ ~ a = \frac{1}{n} ~ ~ \text{for all} ~ ~ n \geq N$. This is a contradiction, so $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ does not converge in this metric space. For part 2: A metric space is complete iff every Cauchy sequence is convergent. A Cauchy sequence is a sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ such that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that: $$d(x_n, x_m) < \epsilon ~ ~ \text{for all} ~ ~ n, m \geq N$$ Reusing part 1's approach, we let $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$. Then if $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence, it must follow that $x_n = x_m$ for all $n, m \geq N$. So the sequence is constant for $n \geq N$, and as such trivially converges. We have proved that if $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is a Cauchy sequence in this metric space, then it must be convergent. Therefore this metric space is complete. Are these proofs valid? In particular, is the use of contradiction sound in part 1 and does the reasoning follow in part 2? I've learned to be careful with analysis arguments, so could someone check over my work?

My concern is that at the moment measures have been introduced as an extension of such notions as area and volume, I can understand that the additivity property came alone naturally. However, I believe, that at that moment the choice f.a. vs. c.a. might not have any strong arguments. Later, it appeared that in many cases the space of c.a. (but not f.a.) measures is the dual of a corresponding space of all bounded continuous functions. Since the latter is a pretty ""natural"" object, I would say that its dual is ""natural"" as well. Would it be right to say that c.a. measures are more ""natural"" than f.a. ones, or that it appeared to be more successful/useful, and if so - why do we need the f.a. measures? I hope, that a bit loose formulation of the question still allows for an answer.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

Can someone link me to a proof of this? It seems to me like it's probably false: $\mathbb Q^n$ is countable, so how can an uncountable group be embedded (unless the space has uncountable dimension)?

For which of the following functions g defined for all numbers x does the graph of g intersect the graph of f ? and 4  possible answers are A.g(x)=x-2
B.g(x)=x+3
C.g(x)=2*x-2
D.g(x)=2*x+3
E.g(x)=3*x-2 first what i did not understand what does mean For which of the following functions g defined for all numbers x does the graph of g intersect the graph of f ? 
does it means that which  g  intersect of f for all x or?answer is E,i have guessed that for  intersection we  should have
$|2*x|+4=g(x)$,clearly C and D no,because they are parallel lines with common slopes,so whe should have $|2*x|+4=x-2$ or
$|2*x|+4=x+3$ or
$|2*x|+4=3*x-2$ after  some calculation we will get
$|2*x|=x-6$ or
$|2*x|=x-3$ |2*x|=3*x-6 first can't be ,because $|2*x|>=x$
second also  using the same rule,only one left $|2*x|=3*x-6$
by using solving,for example if  $x>0$
$2*x=3*x-6$
$x=6$ if $x<0$ $-2*x=3*x-6$ $x=6/5$ is there any short way to solve it?","['absolute-value', 'algebra-precalculus']"

We'll think of $\pi s$ as the ancestor of $s$, with respect to the past temporal development $\pi:\rho\rightarrow \sigma$. To each person $s\in\sigma X$ we associate the whole family of ancestors of $s$, denoted by
$$ (-)\cdot s=\{\pi s\}_{\rho;\pi:\rho\rightarrow\sigma}$$

425490,How would one work this out (surface integral of a function),"Given the definition of the surface integral: $$Area=\iint_{S}{\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{S}} = \iint_{D}{f(\mathbf{r}(u,v))\cdot \left |\mathbf{r_u} \times \mathbf{r_v}  \right |dA}$$ Where $\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ is a vector function to describe $\mathbf{S}$. (Note the bold typesetting indicates vectors for F, r, S). $\mathbf{r}_u$ means the partial differential of r with respect to u. Now the question given is: Evaluate the surface integral $\iint_{S}{x^2z^2}dS$
  S is the part of the cone $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$ that lies between the planes $z=1$ and $z = 2$ Now I tried this and came to a totally wrong solution. Looking up the solution in the solution manual gave me a different to approach the problem. The manual parameterized the function to $x,y$ by describing ""S is the part of the surface $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ And then it used the standard approach of
$$\iint_{S}{\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{S}} = \iint_{D}{f(x,y,g(x,y))\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)^2+1}dA}$$
Which results in $\frac{384\sqrt{2}}{3}\pi$ I tried a complete different approach in my work around. Instead of parameterizing the surface by simply stating ""z"" I tried to parameterize it using the fact that z is a cone:
$$z = z, 1 < z < 3$$
$$x = \cos(\theta), 0 < \theta < 2\pi$$
$$y = \sin(\theta)$$
$$\mathbf{r}(z,\theta) = \cos(\theta)\mathbf{i}+\sin(\theta)\mathbf{j}+z\mathbf{k}$$ working the above problem out I could find
$$\left |\mathbf{r_z} \times \mathbf{r_\theta}  \right | = \sqrt{ z^2\cos^2(\theta) + z^2\cos^2(\theta)} = z$$
$$f(\mathbf{r}(z,\theta)) = \cos^2(\theta)z^2$$
$$A=\int\limits_0^{2\pi}{\int\limits_1^3{\cos^2(\theta)z^3}dz}d\theta= \int\limits_0^{2\pi}{\cos^2(\theta)}d\theta \int\limits_1^3{z^3}dz$$
$$A = 20 \int\limits_0^{2\pi}{\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos(2\theta)}d\theta$$
$$A=20\left(\pi+\left[ \sin(4\pi)-\sin(0)\pi\right]\right)=20\pi$$ Which is a total different solution. What did I do wrong, where did I take the wrong decision in this answer?","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration']"
425494,Vorticity equation in index notation (curl of Navier-Stokes equation),"I am trying to derive the vorticity equation and I got stuck when trying to prove the following relation using index notation:

considering that the fluid is incompressible $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0 $, $\pmb \omega = {\rm curl}(\mathbf{u})$ and that $\nabla \cdot \pmb \omega = 0.$ Here follows what I've done so far:

425522,Integral of wedge product of two one forms on a Riemann surface,"I'm having trouble verifying an elementary assertion made in this answer on MathOverflow.  It seems more like a math.stackexchange question, so I'm asking it here. Anyway, the assertion is as follows (mostly copied from the question) : ""Let $X$ be a genus $g$ surface, with $a_1$, ..., $a_g$, $b_1$, ..., $b_g$ a standard basis [for $H_1(X;\mathbb{Z})$]. Let $\omega$ and $\eta$ be two one-forms. Let $(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_{2g})$ be the integrals $(\int_{a_1} \omega, \ldots, \int_{a_g} \omega, \int_{b_1} \omega, \ldots, \int_{b_g} \omega)$. Let $(v_1, \ldots, v_{2g})$ be the same integrals for $\eta$. Now, in terms of the $u$'s and the $v$'s, what is $\int_X \omega \wedge \eta$? The answer, which I leave for you to check, is $u_1 v_{g+1} + u_2 v_{g+2} + \cdots + u_g v_{2g} - u_{g+1} v_1 - u_{g+2} v_2 - \cdots - u_{2g} v_g$.""  Can anyone help me verify this? EDIT : On MathOverflow, David Speyer applies this to the case where $\omega$ and $\eta$ are holomorphic $1$-forms, and thus closed.  Maybe this condition is necessary?  It feels like one should somehow apply Stokes's theorem to the $4g$-gon obtained as a fundamental domain for the universal cover of $X$; the $a_i$ and $b_i$ will be the boundary components.  But I don't quite see how to do this. EDIT 2 : It's now been answered, but just in case someone comes across this later I thought I'd point out that the question as posed did not make any sense unless you assumed that $\omega$ and $\eta$ are closed -- otherwise, it would not make sense to integrate them along homology classes!","['surfaces', 'differential-forms', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
