3880940,"Describing $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f(x, n) \; \mathrm{d}n$ as a contour integral.","My question essentially has to do with the derivative of a Contour Integral's parameterized curve. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n$$ to be exact. Where $\partial \Omega(x)$ is a Jordan curve which is differentiable for any $x \in \mathbb{C}$ , and $f(n, x): \mathbb{C}^2 \to 
\mathbb{C}$ integrable around the curve $\partial \Omega(x)$ in respect to $n$ . Define $\gamma$ as the parameterized curve of $\partial \Omega$ , and the terminology $f_x(n, x) = \frac{\partial f(n, x)}{\partial x}$ is used. My work has essentially gotten down to these steps. STEP 1: Turning the contour integral into the usual integral. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta.$$ STEP 2: Using the Liebniz rule. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta.$$ STEP 3: Taking the derivative. $$= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_x(\gamma(\theta, x), x) + \gamma_x(\theta, x) \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_n(\gamma(\theta, x), x) + \gamma_{\theta x}(\theta, x) f(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta.$$ STEP 4: Separating the integrals. $$= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_x(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta$$ $$+ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_x(\theta, x) \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_n(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \mathrm{d}\theta$$ $$+ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_{\theta x}(\theta, x) f(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta.$$ STEP 5: Simplifying the first integral into a contour integral. $$\int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_x(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta = \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f_x(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n.$$ STEP 6: Plugging in the first integral to get the final answer. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \oint_{\partial \Omega(x)} f(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n$$ $$= \int_{\partial \Omega(x)} f_x(n, x) \; \mathrm{d}n+\int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_x(\theta, x) \gamma_\theta(\theta, x) f_n(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta$$ $$+\int_{0}^{2\pi} \gamma_{\theta x}(\theta, x) f(\gamma(\theta, x), x) \; \mathrm{d}\theta.$$ I am unsure of how to simplify this further or if this is even a decent approach. Does anybody have a good resource for this? My goal is to write this derivative as multiple contour integrals, bar any $\gamma$ -parameterized functions.

3880986,Generic question about commutative algebra,"I don't know how to categorize better this question: I'm studing from the notes of a course of commutative algebra. Anyway, I read that for a finitely generated $k$ -algebra $A$ , with $k=\bar{k}$ an algebraically closed field, we can view $A$ as an algebra of functions from the set $X:=\operatorname{Max}(A)$ to $k$ . In fact any element $f\in A$ defines a function on $X$ such that $f(x)=\bar{f}\in A/x$ , with $x\in X$ , and $A/x$ must be $k$ because it is algebraically closed. In this context we studied also the Hilbert Nullstellensatz, that here basically says that taken a finitely generated $k$ -algebra $A:=k[x_1,\dots ,x_n]/I$ , with $I$ an ideal of $k[x_1,\dots ,x_n]$ , then $\sqrt{I}$ can be recovered from the polynomials $f$ in $k[x_1,\dots ,x_n]$ such that, viewed as an element of $A$ , one has $f(x)=0$ for all $x\in\operatorname{Max}(A)$ . (Obviously $f(x)$ is defined as above). A few pages later, these notes define the so-called geometric points of $A$ , that are $k$ -homomorphisms from $A$ (a $k$ -algebra) to a field extension $K\supset k$ . It turns out that there is a bijection between certain equivalence classes of geometric points of $A$ and the prime spectrum of $A$ . Again, the elements of $A$ can be regarded as functions on the elements of $Y:=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ . (In the same  way as before, $f(y)=\bar{f}\in A/y$ , if $y\in Y$ ). I don't have a precise question, because I'm not very practised yet in this commutative algebra \ algebraic geometry sector, I'd just like to know if these two ""constructions"" are linked one to the other or they are simply independent; I feel like there is something that I am missing overall.

3881023,Weak Convergence in Infinite Hilbert space,"Let $H$ be an infinite Hilbert space. Show: For all $x \in H$ with $\|x\|\leq1$ , there exists a sequence $(u_n)$ in $H$ with $\| u_n\|=1 $ such that $u_n \rightharpoonup x$ . My attempt: Since $H$ is infinite, there exists a countable subspace $K$ with $x\in K$ . By Gram-Schmidt, we can find a orthonormal basis $(y_n)$ for $K$ . Hence, $x=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k y_k$ for some $a_k \in \mathbb{F}$ Let $u_n= \frac {\sum_{k=1}^n a_k y_k}{\|\sum_{k=1}^n a_k y_k \|}$ . Then $\| u_n\|=1$ . Hence, we are done.

3881150,Homomorphisms of a Semidirect Product,"Suppose $G_1=N_1\rtimes H_1$ , $G_2=N_2\rtimes H_2$ are semidirect products of (not necessarily finite or abelian) groups. Suppose $f:N_1\to N_2$ and $g: H_1\to H_2$ are group homomorphisms. How can we use this data to construct a morphism $h:G_1\to G_2$ ? The obvious map $(f,g)$ doesn't work since it does not preserve multiplication. It seems one needs to cleverly choose how to glue these such that in the end the necessary diagram commutes, but it is continuing to evade me. Context is the following: suppose $N$ and $H$ are affine group schemes where $H$ acts on $N$ via group automorphisms. I wish to show that $G(R):=N(R)\rtimes H(R)$ yields an affine group scheme.

3881247,is 1001 the only sum of two positive cubes that is the product of three consecutive odd primes?,"That is $\ 10^3+1^3=7.11.13$ . I could find no other examples.
So I am looking to see if there are any more solutions to $ x^3+y^3=p.q.r$ , where $ x, y$ are positive integers and $ p<q<r$ are consecutive odd primes. Now $ x^3 + y^3 =LQ$ where $ L=x+y$ , and $ Q = L^2 -3xy$ . After playing with the problem for a while I thought maybe I should try and express the triple of factors in terms of the gaps between them. So $ g_1 = q-p$ , and $ g_2=r-q$ , and I was thinking what was the biggest possible factor that divided the resulting sum of cubes after choosing the gaps. Using elementary arguments I found that, $ L=q$ , or $ L=r$ , so dealing with the later case put $ L=r$ , and $ Q=pq= L^2 -3xy$ , eliminate $p$ , and $q$ , and put $ x = (L+d)/2$ , $ y=(L-d)/2$ for $d$ an odd positive integer. Giving $ L^2 - (g_1+2g_2)L+g_1(g_1+g_2)=L^2-3(L^2-d^2)/4$ . Completing the square and simplifying gives $ z^2-9d^2 = 4f$ , where $ z= 3L-2(g_1+2g_2)$ , and $ f = g_1^2+g_1g_2+g_2^2$ , the gaps are even so suitable factors can always be found, that is $a$ , $b$ , such that $4f= ab$ , and we get using the difference of squares $z= (a+b)/2$ , and so $L=\frac{z+2(g_1+2g_2)}{3}$ .
Now the largest $z$ is $f+1$ , and so the largest, $$L=\frac{g_1^2+g_1g_2+g_2^2+1+2g_1+4g_2}{3}$$ and chosing $g$ to be the bigger of the two gaps gives a largest $L=\frac{3g^2+6g+1}{3}<(g+1)^2$ so for both cases the largest possible ""prime"" factor in any triple of solutions was bounded above by roughly the square of the largest gap.
Looking at Wikipedia prime gaps then Dr T Nicely's site on first occurrence of prime gaps https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/gaps/gaplist.html I noticed that apart from a number of small cases that the primes where gaps first occurred where larger than $(g+1)^2$ suggesting that 1001 is the only case for the range of known first occurrences of prime gaps. I also saw somewhere but cannot remember at the moment something called Shank's conjecture, which is something like the first occurrence of a gap is after a prime that is about $e^\sqrt g$ , which is obviously for large enough gap much bigger than $(g+1)^2$ .
See section 7 Marek Wolf 'Some heuristics on the gaps between consecutive primes' https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0481v2.pdf . So this is roughly where I have got with the problem. I suspect I have missed a simpler solution? 35 is the only sum of two cubes equal to the product of two consecutive odd primes, using the notation above, let $ x^3 +y^3 = pq $ , and $ 8<p<q$ be consecutive odd primes then $ L< Q = L^2 -3xy $ , Put $ p=L$ , $ q=Q$ and $ x=(L+d)/4$ , $ y = (L-d)/4$ , then $ (p^2+3d^2)/4=q$ , so $ (p^2+3)/4 \le q$ but for $p> 8$ , $ q>2p$ , which contradicts Bertrand's Postulate whereby if we have consecutive primes then $ p< q<2p$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand's_postulate","['number-theory', 'eisenstein-integers', 'prime-gaps']"
3881334,Does a flat partial connection promote to a flat connection?,"Let $M$ be a contact manifold (with globally defined contact form, for simplicity) of dimension $2n+1 \ge 5$ . So $H$ is a rank $2n$ subbundle of $TM$ and $[H,H] = TM$ . A partial connection with respect to $H$ on a vector bundle $E$ is a map $\Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(H^* \otimes E)$ satisfying the Leibniz rule in the sense \begin{align}
\nabla fs = df|_H \otimes s + f\nabla s.
\end{align} Let $L \le T^*M$ be the annihilator of the contact distribution. Then there is a canonical injective vector bundle homomorphism (the Levi map) $L \hookrightarrow \Lambda^2T^*M$ given by $\alpha \mapsto d\alpha|_H$ and the image consists of non-degenerate skew-forms. In particular there is a rank 3 subbundle of $\Lambda^2H^*$ , call it $\Lambda^2_\perp H^*$ consisting of forms trace free with respect to the image of the Levi map. There is an equivalence class of full connections $[\tilde{\nabla}]$ on E which extend $\nabla$ . The (partial) curvature of a partial connection can be defined by choosing such a representative and projecting the curvature $\Lambda^2 \otimes \operatorname{End}(E) \to \Lambda^2_\perp H^* \otimes \operatorname{End}(E)$ . Furthermore in https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5519 it is easily shown that there is a unique representative connection in $[\tilde{\nabla}]$ such that the projection $\Lambda^2 \otimes \operatorname{End}(E) \to L \otimes \operatorname{End}(E)$ vanishes. Accordingly a connection with vanishing partial curvature has a unique lift $\tilde{\nabla}$ such that \begin{align}
\tilde{\nabla}_X\tilde{\nabla}_Ys - \tilde{\nabla}_Y\tilde{\nabla}_Xs - \tilde{\nabla}_{[X,Y]}s = 0 \ \ \ \forall X,Y \in H.
\end{align} My instinct tells me the maximal non-integrability of H means that $\tilde{\nabla}$ must be flat, but I can't prove this for myself or find a source. It is definitely sometimes true. For example one can define the obvious flat partial connection with respect to a trivialisation $\{e_i\}$ of $E$ \begin{align}
\nabla s = d s^{i}|_H \otimes e_i
\end{align} and this has canonical representative \begin{align}
\tilde{\nabla} s = d s^{i} \otimes e_i,
\end{align} which is flat. So there is no general obstruction to this being true. So my question is:  Is it possible to show that $\tilde{\nabla}$ must be flat, and if not, are there conditions one can enforce on $\nabla$ for this to be true?","['connections', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"

3881420,Proof of Lévy's continuity theorem and convergence of the Laplace transforms,"Let $\mu_n$ be a probability measure on $(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R))$ with characteristic function $\varphi_n$ for $n\in\mathbb N$ and $\varphi:\mathbb R\to\mathbb C$ be continuous at $0$ with $$\varphi_n\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}\varphi\tag1.$$ Using $(1)$ , we are able to show that $(\mu_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is tight, i.e. for all $\varepsilon>0$ , there is a compact $K\subseteq\mathbb R$ with $\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\mu_n(K^c)<\varepsilon$ . Question 1 : Why is this enough to conclude that there is a probability measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R))$ such that $\mu_n$ weakly converges to $\mu$ as $n\to\infty$ ? I know that it is a consequence of Prohorov's theorem that a sequence of probability measures $\nu_n$ weakly converges to some probability measure $\nu$ if and only if $(\nu_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is tight and there is a separating family $^1$ $\mathcal C$ of bounded continuous functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ with $$\int f\:{\rm d}\nu_n\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}\int f\:{\rm d}\nu\tag2\;\;\;\text{for all }f\in\mathcal C.$$ So, aren't we missing the existence of the separating family?

According to Hartshorne, the $\tilde{U_i}$ 's can be glued together, and the resulting scheme will be the normalization of $X$ . So in order to glue them together (with exercise 2.12, the Glueing lemma), we need to define open sets $U_{ij}\subseteq \tilde{U_i}$ for all $i\neq j$ , such that for all such $i,j$ we have an isomorphism $\varphi_{ij}:U_{ij}\to U_{ji}$ , along with some more compatibility properties.

3882758,Solving ODE knowing general solution of a linear ODE.,"Consider the following ODE. $$ f''(x) + p(x)f'(x) + q(x)f(x) = 0 $$ Assume that it has general solution $f(x) = c_1 f_1(x) + c_2 f_2(x)$ . Now, consider the following ODE. $$ g'''(x) + g'(x)(-2p'(x)-p^2(x)+4q(x)) + g(x)(-p''(x)-p(x)p'(x)+2q'(x)) = 0 $$ The claim is that it is possible to obtain solution of $g(x)$ in terms of $f_1$ and $f_2$ . It is not clear to me how. The only thing that I have noticed (not clear if useful) that ODE can be rewritten in the following way. $$ g'''(x) -2g'(x)(p'(x)+\frac{p^2}{2}(x)-2q(x)) -g(x)(p'+\frac{p^2}{2}-2q)'(x) = 0 $$ It looks very close to the product rule but not quite as there is factor of $2$ difference between terms. I found that solution is supposed to be the following which maybe can help to guess how to find this solution. $$ g(x) = e^{\int p(x) dx} \left( c_1 f_1^2(x) + c_2 f_1(x)f_2(x) + c_3 f_2^2(x) \right)$$ I considered a new function $h(x) = g(x) e^{-\int p(x) dx}$ and found a differential equation that it satisfies. $$h'''+3ph''+(p'+2p^2+4q)h'+(2q'+4pq)h = 0$$ It is not clear to me how this weight factor $e^{-\int p(x) dx}$ is motivated because the resulting differential equation is still not obvious to me on how to solve it.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

3882901,Metrizable Topological Space In Many Ways,"Prove that if a topological space $(X, T)$ is metrizable then it is metrizable in infinitely many ways. $$$$ As the given topological space is metrizable so there exists a metric $d$ on the set $X$ such that the it can generate a class of open subsets which is the topology $T$ . Now as we know that whenever $d$ is a metric on $X$ , then the function satisfying $$d'(x, y)=\frac{d(x, y)}{1+d(x, y)}$$ , is also a metric on $X$ . Now suppose $A$ be an open subset of $X$ under the metric $d$ . Now chose a $x \in A$ , then there exists some $\epsilon$ such that for all $y$ satisfying $$d(x, y) < \epsilon$$ lie in $A$ . Now for the metric $d'$ we see that $\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}$ works and for all $y$ satisfying $$d'(x, y) < \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}$$ satisfy the above equation and hence lie in the set $A$ and hence $A$ is also open under the metric $d'$ . So the class of open sets generated by the metric $d$ can also be generated by the metric $d'$ and hence $d'$ can also induce the topology $T$ . Similarly we can find infinitely many metric like $d''$ satisfying $$d''(x, y)=\frac{d'(x, y)}{1+d'(x, y)}$$ . And hence the topological space $(X, T)$ is metrizable in many ways. $$$$ Is the proof Correct??","['general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'metric-spaces']"

Apparently this should follow directly from the following Corollary from Eisenbud's  Book : Corollary 4.15: Let $M$ be a finitely generated graded Cohen-Macaulay $R$ -module. If $s$ is the smallest number such that $HF_M(d) = HP_{M}(d)$ for all $d \geq s$ ,

As far as I've understood, this implies that $R/I$ has krull-dimension zero. This then implies that $\depth(R/I) = {\rm kdim}(R/I) = 0$ , i.e $R/I$ is Cohen-Macaulay.
Now Corollary 4.15 implies that $i_{\reg}(I) = 1-0+\reg(R/I) \neq \reg(I)$ . What have I missed? I think $\reg(R/I) = \reg(I) + 1$ , so the result would be $2$ apart from what I'm trying to achieve.","['krull-dimension', 'algebraic-geometry', 'ideals', 'hilbert-polynomial', 'commutative-algebra']"

The thing is, I don't think I have that of a solid background in functional analysis and PDEs, and I am looking for some help or a rather self contained source which proves that such decomposition exists $$ -\Delta(\cdot)= \sum_{l=0}^\infty \lambda_l \left \langle \cdot,\phi_l \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}\phi_l$$ What I do know : I wasn't able to find many sources which dive deep into this problem, but the first thing I was able to realize is this decomposition probably isn't on $L^2(M)$ but rather some subspace of the form $V=\left \{ f\ \text{nice enough}|\ f|_{\partial M}=0\right \}$ , the reason for this is that we probably need the laplacian to be self adjoint, and looking at one of Green's identities $$\int_M u\Delta v - v\Delta u   =\int_{\partial M}u\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}-v \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}$$ We need to zero the RHS with the constraint. What is $V$ ? I saw alot of references to a ""Sobolev space $H_0^1(M)$ "" but couldn't find a coherent definition of it, in addition to the fact that it is equipped with a different inner product than of $L^2(M)$ which makes things more confusing for me. Anyhow, this tells us automatically why eigenfunctions must be orthogonal, since if we have $$ -\Delta \phi_1 = \lambda_1 \phi_1,\ -\Delta \phi_2 = \lambda_2 \phi_2$$ for $\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \neq 0$ different then $$\left \langle \lambda_1\phi_1,\phi_2 \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}=-\left \langle \Delta\phi_1,\phi_2 \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}=-\left \langle \phi_1,\Delta\phi_2 \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}=\left \langle \phi_1,\lambda_2\phi_2 \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}$$ and we get that $\left \langle \phi_1,\phi_2 \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}=0$ I also know that $-\Delta$ is positive definite since $$\int_M u (-\Delta) u=\int_M \left \| \nabla u \right \|_g^2\geq 0$$ What I'm looking for : This topic is pretty weird for me right now and I would like to learn about it thoroughly. Are my proofs correct or relevant at all? As I mentioned what is $V$ ? it's hard for me to see why $C^2(M) \cap C(\bar{M})$ needs to be restricted further. How do we know that $-\Delta$ is compact if at all? This means that if $f_k \rightarrow f$ in $V$ , then $-\Delta f_k$ has a convergent subsequence of functions. I know according to functional analysis this should imply the spectral decomposition but I don't know whether this is true. Edit: appearantly not, $-\Delta^{-1}$ is. Then I am looking at the moment for a proof of that Assuming 3 is true, we also get for free that the eigenvalues are discrete $0\leq \lambda_0 \leq \lambda_1 \leq \cdots$ . However, I saw claims that $\lambda_k \rightarrow \infty$ (when according to functional analysis it should approach to $0$ ). This doesn't make sense to me, how sums like the spectral decomposition $\Delta f=\sum_{l=0}^\infty  \lambda_l\left \langle f,\phi_l \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}\phi_l  $ converge? How does one show $\left \{ \phi_l\right \}_{l=0}^\infty$ is complete? meaning we can express any $f\in V$ as a fourier series $f=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left \langle f,\phi_l \right \rangle_{L^2(M)}\phi_l  $ Sorry for the mess of a question, In the probable case I said something wrong I would love to hear.

I will use the notation $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ to refer to this topology.  Then one can ask how topological properties of $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ are related to series properties of $\sum a_n$ .  For example, I can show: Proposition :  The following are equivalent. $\sum a_n$ converges. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is discrete. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is disconnected. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is Hausdorff And there are other nice things.  For example, $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is compact iff $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is cofinite iff $\liminf a_n > 0$ . With this language, my question can be reformulated as... Are $\left(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{n}\right)$ and $\left(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ homeomorphic? I have made very little progress on this.  Of course, the identity function $i:(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})\rightarrow (\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{n})$ is a continuous bijection, but the inverse map is not continuous.  Also, if there is such a bijection, there there is such a bijection with agrees with $i$ on any preassigned finite set. Edit I thought I add in a slightly suprising (to me, at least) example when things work out to be homeomorphic. Begin with a convergent series $\sum c_n$ . and divergent series $\sum a_n$ with $\lim a_n = 0$ .  Create a new series $b_n$ using all the terms of $c_n$ and $a_n$ (in whatever order you wish).  Then $(\mathbb{N}, a_n)$ and $(\mathbb{N}, b_n)$ are homeomorphic.  The idea is that since $\lim a_n = 0$ , there is a convergent infinite subseries $\sum_A a_n$ .  Then we use a bijection which with $A$ and $A\cup \{\text{indices of }c_n\}$ to ""squeeze"" the $c_n$ in without changing the topology.  Of course, I am glossing over many details, but I can include them if desired.","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
3883706,Different complex structures of $\mathbb C^1$,"When I was learning deformation theory of Kodaira from his book 《complex manifolds》, I feel the definition of deformation of complex structures is rather strange and abstract, is seems like a lot of fibers live in the same base space which satisfies some restrictive conditions, each one called a deformation of others, but from the literal meaning, deformation should only talk about the changing of the space itself, not about the extra space, so I want to visualze the process of deformation, but I failed. I know if there exist a biholomorphic map between two complex structures, we say they share the same complex structure, I know for 1-dimensional complex projective space $\mathbb CP^1$ , there is only one complex structure, but for 1-dimensional complex torus, there are infinite many complex sturctures not biholomorphic to each other, I learned deformation theory a lot, remembering a lot of facts and theorems about deformation theory, but I never feel I really know what we mean when we say a complex structure. So I try to ask myself the simplest question, what's the simplest and most visuable deformation? first I feel that maybe $\mathbb C^1$ is the most visuable one, and I find it surprising that I have never thought about deforming $\mathbb C^1$ before! the simplest case! So I try to deform the complex structure of $\mathbb C^1$ , for one person in some place draw a complex coordinate $\mathbb C^1$ , and another person in some other place draw another complex coordinate, when can we say these two coordinate share the same complex structure? For $z\in\mathbb C^1$ , add a arbitrary constant or multiply a constant won't change its complex structure, so if the other coordinat is $w=az+b$ , we can always say that they share the same complex structure, but if the other person makes his "" $1=1,i=2i$ "" of the original one, they may have different complex structures? So the complex structure may have something to do with ratio of $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis? And if it is right, from this point of view, I think there are infinite many different complex structures of $\mathbb C^1$ , but what's the dimension of the moduli space of the complex structures of $\mathbb C^1$ ?

Then we find that this agrees with Cech cohomology in most useful cases. But it seems like in modern algebraic geometry, the term ""cohomology"" refers to Weil cohomology theories. Can the derived functor cohomology be made into a Weil cohomology? Does every Weil cohomology arise from a derived functor? Is the derived functor cohomology of Hartshorne worth studying these days, or is most work done in terms of Weil cohomology theories, or are they largely unrelated?

3884239,Finding the limit of the integral of some uniformly convergant sequence of functions,"Let $\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb N}$ be a sequence of uniformly convergent functions on the interval [0,1]. Find the limit of the following integral: $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_0^1nf_n(t)e^{-nt}\,dt$$ Here is my thought process so far. In isolation l'hospital's rule would indicate that $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{n}{e^{nt}}$ would tend to zero, and so I expect that this exponential term will be more dominating. Normally Lebesgue's Dominated convergence theorem (or at the very least his monotone convergence theorem) would allow us to say that this uniformly convergent sequence of functions would converge to f...however I am guessing the surrounding terms sufficiently mess this up to the point where we no longer have convergence. My guess is the point of this question is to prove that this is the case. We know that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\{f_n\}_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is measurable, but If I can show that $g_n= \frac{n}{e^{nt}}$ is not measurable for $t\in[0,1]$ (because it tends to zero), then can I say this limit does not exist?

I understand the whole process of solving a differential equation (the separation of variables, isolating N, finding k etc...) and I'm getting proficient at it. However, the only thing I'm still having difficulty grappling with is why we say that dN/dt = kN to begin with. The examples used in my textbook: Radioactive decay . After 3 days, 50 percent of the radioactivity produced by a nuclear explosion has disappeared. How long does it take for 99 percent of this radioactivity to disappear? The rate of change of the mass of our substance is negative, and is proportional at each moment to the mass of the substance at that moment. This statement means that if x = x(t) is the mass of the radioactive substance at time t, then dx/dt = -kx  (k > 0). Population growth . Consider a laboratory culture of bacteria with unlimited food and no enemies. If N = N(t) denotes the number of bacteria present at time t, it is natural to assume that the rate of change of N is proportional to N itself, or dN/dt = kN  (k > 0). If the number of bacteria present at the beginning is N_0, and this number doubles after 2 hours (the “doubling time”), how many are there after 6 hours? After t hours? There's always this idea present in these problems that the rate of change of _____ is proportional at each moment in time to _______ at that moment, or dN/dt = kN. Both mathematically and intuitively, why is this relationship ""natural to assume""? What (if any) mathematical property dictates this? P.S.

We say that $\mathcal{F}_1\pitchfork \mathcal{F}_2$ if $T_p L^{(1)}+T_pL^{(2)}=T_p M$ for any $p\in M$ , where $L^{(1)}$ and $L^{(2)}$ are the leaves trough $p$ . Now if we have that $\mathcal{F_1}\pitchfork \mathcal{F}_2$ , we define $\mathcal{F}_1\cap \mathcal{F}_2$ to be the foliation where the leaves are the connected components of $L^{(1)}\cap L^{(2)}$ . Now we want to check that is a foliation with codimension the sum of the codimensions of $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ . I think the idea is to use the implicit function theorem but I am getting nowhere in concrete. That is take foliated charts for $\mathcal{F}_1$ , $(x_1,...,x_k,y_1,...,y_{m-k})$ , and foliated charts for $\mathcal{F}^2$ , $(w_1,...,w_k',z_1,...,z_{m-k'})$ such that $p\cap L^{(1)}\cap L^{(2)}=\{p\in U: y_1(p)=ct,...,y_{m-k}(p)=ct,z_1(p)=ct,...,z_{m-k'}(p)=ct\}$ . Now from this I have tried and construct a new coordinate chart so that we get the result bu I got nowhere. Any help or hints with this are aprecciated. Thanks in advance. Attempt at solution : First thing we note is that since $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ are foliations we will have that the leaves of this new foliation will cover $M$ , are disjoint since we are taking the connected components, and will be path connected since we are taking the connected components and $M$ is locally path-connected. Now we need to find the foliated charts of $\mathcal{F}$ and check it's dimension. Let $p\in M$ , note that since $L^{(1)}$ and $L^{(2)}$ are transversal we will have that $L^{(2)}\cap L^{(1)}$ is a submanifold of $L^{(1)}$ .Using the local normal form we know that there exists open set of $p\in L^{(2)}, U,$ and coordinate chart $(V,\phi)=(V,x_1,...,x_k)$ for $L^{(1)}$ such that $U\cap L^{(1)}=\{p\in V : x^{k'}(p)=...=x^k(p)=0\}$ , where $k'=dim L_1 -(dim L_1 + dim L_2 -dim M)= codim \mathcal{F}_2$ . Now note that the way we gave the manifold structure to $L^{(1)}$ was that the topology was generated by the plaques $L^{(1)}\cap U'$ where $U'$ was a foliated chart for $p$ , and the coordinate chart was the restriction of the foliated chart to the non-constant components. So we have the $(x_1,...,x_k)$ are associated with a chart of $M$ , $(x^1,...,x^k,y^1,...,y^{d-k})$ such that the connected components of $L^{(1)}\cap U'$ are of the form $\{p\in U' : y^1(p)=ct,...,y^{d-k}(p)=ct\}$ . Now we have $U$ is a plaque for $U''\cap L^{(2)}$ . We also know that $p$ will be in a connected component of $L^{(1)}\cap L^{(2)}$ , wich we now denote by $L$ . If we consider the foliated chart to be $(W:=U'\cap U'',x^1,...,x^k,y^1,...,y^{d-k})$ we will have that the connected components of $W\cup L$ are of the form $\{p\in W: y^1(p)=ct,...,y^{d-k}(p)=ct,x^{k-k'}(p)=,...,x^k(p)=0\}$ . To see the statement about the dimension we note that $codim \mathcal{F}_1+ dim L^{(1)}-(dim L^{(1)}+dim L^{(2)}-dim M)=codim\mathcal{F}_1 +codim \mathcal{F}_2 $ .","['foliations', 'transversality', 'differential-geometry']"
3884406,Global contact form defining contact structure,"Let $M$ be a $(2n+1)$ -manifold and $\xi$ a smooth hyperplane field. It's easy to see that for each point $p$ exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $\xi_{|U} = \ker \alpha_{U}$ , where $\alpha_U$ is a smooth 1-form. I have read that if $M$ and $\xi$ are both oriented, we can find $\alpha$ $\textbf{globally}$ defined such that $\xi = \ker \alpha$ in all $M$ . I can't see why, I mean, if $M$ is oriented by a volume form $\omega \in \Omega^{2n+1}(M)$ , without supposing any kind of regularity in $\xi$ I don't know how to construct this globally defined 1-form. This exercise is proposed in $\textit{Introductory Lectures on Contact Geometry}$ by John B. Etnyre. EDITED: In this post have a nice proof of this statement. I am going to introduce another proof based on it without using Riemannian metrics. When we say that $\xi$ is orientable we refer to $TM/\xi$ is the trivial bundle (by definition). We will say that $\xi$ is $\textit{corientable}$ . In fact, since $\xi$ is a field of hyperplanes the previous quotient is a line bundle, that is, a 1-dimensional bundle. Suposse $\xi$ is coorientable. If $TM/\xi$ is trivial, there exists a $\textbf{global}$ section throughout $TM/\xi$ and therefore a global section $\overline{\alpha}$ in $(TM/\xi)^*$ . Consider $\pi : TM \to (TM/\xi)^*$ and the pullback $\alpha := \pi^*\overline{\alpha}$ . In fact, this $\alpha$ satisfies $\ker \alpha = \xi$ by definition, and it's globally defined. Therefore we have proved that $$
\xi \text{ coorientable} \Longrightarrow \alpha \text{ globally defined}
$$ Reciprocally, assume $\alpha$ globally defining $\xi = \ker \alpha$ throughout $M$ . Then this $\alpha$ induces a non-zero section in $TM/\xi$ , that's mean, $TM/\xi$ is trivial.","['contact-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
3884410,Are there any valid continuous Sudoku grids?,"A standard Sudoku is a $9\times 9$ grid filled with digits such that every row, column, and $3\times 3$ box contains all the integers from $1$ to $9$ . I am thinking about a generalization of Sudoku which I call ""continuous Sudoku"", which consists of a unit square where every point on that square corresponds to a real number. The rules for continuous Sudoku are designed to be analogous to the rules for standard Sudoku, and I've devised two different rulesets: The first ruleset I call ""weak"" continuous Sudoku. In weak continuous Sudoku, the only restriction is that every row and column of the square contains every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ exactly once. The second ruleset I call ""strong"" continuous Sudoku. In strong continuous Sudoku, the rules of weak continuous Sudoku apply, and, in addition, every square sub-region of the unit square contains every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ at least once. This is analogous to the $3\times 3$ box restriction in standard Sudoku. Let $U = [0,1]$ and $U^2 = U\times U$ . More precisely, a weak continuous Sudoku is essentially a function $f:U^2\to U$ , which satisfies the following four properties: If $x,y_1,y_2\in U$ and $y_1\neq y_2$ , then $f(x,y_1)\neq f(x,y_2)$ . If $x_1,x_2,y\in U$ and $x_1\neq x_2$ , then $f(x_1,y)\neq f(x_2,y)$ . If $x\in U$ then $\{z: f(x,y)=z,y\in U\} = U$ . If $y\in U$ then $\{z: f(x,y)=z,x\in U\} = U$ . Now, strong continuous Sudoku is a bit harder to define precisely. A set $S$ is a square sub-region of $U^2$ iff $S\subseteq U^2$ and there exists $z = (z_1,z_2)\in U^2$ and $r>0$ such that $S = \{(x,y)\in U^2:z_1\leq x\leq z_1+r,z_2\leq y\leq z_2+r\}$ . Thus, using this definition, a strong continuous Sudoku is a weak continuous Sudoku which satisfies the following additional property: If $S$ is a square sub-region of $U^2$ , then $f(S) = U$ . I've been trying to look for specific examples of both strong and weak continuous Sudoku grids, but have so far been unsucessful. I'm not sure whether any weak continuous Sudoku exists. My first attempt: $$
f(x,y)=\begin{cases} x+y &\text{if }x+y\leq 1 \\
x+y-1 & \text{if }x+y>1\end{cases}
$$ almost works. It satisfies properties $3$ and $4$ , and almost, but not quite, satisfies $1$ and $2$ . The issue occurs only at boundaries of the square, for example, $f(0.5,0) = 0.5$ and $f(0.5,1)=0.5$ . Any example of a strong continuous Sudoku will likely need to be an extremely discontinuous pathological function, similar to the Conway base 13 function . Obviously, if there are no weak continuous Sudoku grids, then there are no strong continuous Sudoku grids. Even if there are no weak Sudoku grids, it may be possible to slightly modify the definitions to permit small exceptions such as in the above example. The main question I'm asking is: Do any weak continuous Sudoku grids exist, and if they do, do any strong continuous Sudoku grids exist?","['sudoku', 'real-analysis']"

For example you have $$\left\{\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & \lambda\\
0 & 1\\
\end{matrix}\right) \in \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal O_K) : \lambda \in \mathcal O_K\right\}
$$ whose closure is $$\left\{\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & x\\
0 & 1\\
\end{matrix}\right) \in \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) : x \in \mathbb R\right\}.
$$ On the other hand I'm not sure if for all $x \in \mathbb R$ the matrix $\operatorname{diag}(x,x^{-1})$ is part of the closure of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal O_K)$ . So my question is : What is the closure of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal O_K)$ in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ ? Is $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal O_K)$ maybe dense in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ ?","['matrices', 'number-theory', 'group-theory', 'real-numbers']"
3884587,"Does there exist a bijection that is not eventually equal to the identity, but has a finite number of ""crosses""?","Consider a  bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ : We define the (possible infinite) number of ""crosses"" or ""intersections"" by the following: For every pair $i,j$ with $i<j, $ define: $$
\alpha_{ij}=\begin{cases}
0&\ \text{if} \ f(j) > f(i)\\[8pt]
1&\ \text{if} \ f(j) < f(i)\\[8pt]
\end{cases}
$$ Then the number of (possibly infinite) intersections is $\ s(f) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( \sum_{j=i+1}^\infty\alpha_{ij} \right)$ . (s depends only on the bijection $f$ ). Also, define a bijection eventually equal to the identity to be one in which $ \exists N$ such that $f(n) = n \quad \forall n \geq N$ . My conjecture is that a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is eventually equal to the identity $ \iff s$ is finite, but I don't know how to prove this formally. Note that my conjecture would be false with bijections $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ , for example: The pigeonhole principle came to mind, but I'm not sure if it's useful or necessary for a proof.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3884626,Transitivity of sub-manifolds,"Good afternoon! Here is my problem. Say I have three (smooth) manifolds, $Z \subseteq Y \subseteq X$ such that $Z$ is a submanifold of $Y$ and $Y$ is a submanifold of $X$ . Say $Z, Y, X$ have respective dimensions $p, m, n$ . I'm trying to prove $Z$ is a submanifold of $X$ . The definition I use for submanifold is: $M$ is a submanifold of $N$ if there exists a chart $(U,f)$ compatible with the smooth structure on $N$ such that $f(U\cap M) = f(U) \cap A$ where $A$ is an affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}(N)}$ . I've found a few similar posts ( [1] , [2] ). [1] uses a different definition, and [2] uses the same definition as I do, but there's no answer to the post. Here is where I got with this problem: Let $z \in Z$ . We know that $Z$ is a submanifold of $Y$ , so there exists a chart $(V,g)$ on $Y$ , compatible with the smooth structure, such that $z \in V$ and $g(V \cap Z) = g(V)\cap A_p$ , where $A_p \subseteq R^m$ is affine of dimension $p$ . Similarly, $z \in Y$ which is a submanifold of $X$ , so there exists a chart $(U, f)$ on $X$ such that $z \in U$ and $f(U\cap Y) = f(U)\cap A_m$ , where $A_m \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is affine of dimension $m$ . Now, we'd like to find a chart $(W, h)$ on $X$ such that $x \in W$ and $h(W \cap Z) = h(W) \cap A_p$ . I was thinking of this: Without loss of generality, we can assume $V \subseteq U$ . Now, the chart $g$ goes from $V$ to $\mathbb{R^m}$ . So we can compose it with a linear transformation $\tau$ so that $\tau\circ g: V \to A_m \subseteq R^n$ . Now, $(\tau \circ g)(V\cap Z) = (\tau\circ g)(V) \cap \tau(A_p)$ , where $\tau(A_p)$ also is an affine subspace of dimension $p$ , this time in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The problem is, $V$ is a coordinate patch on $Y$ , not a patch on $X$ , so this still isn't good enough. And this is where I'm stuck. I was thinking, since $g$ has to be compatible with the standard structure of $Y$ (which is compatible with restrictions of the standard structure on $X$ ), the restriction of $f$ to $V$ has to be compatible with $g$ . In particular, there is a diffeomorphism $\phi := \left.f\right|_Y \circ g^{-1} : g(V) \to f(V\cap Y) \subseteq A_m \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ . But whatever I do, there's still the issue that we're working on a chart of $Y$ , not a chart of $X$ . If someone would have an idea on how to proceed, I'd be really grateful!

3884658,Find number of normal subgroups in $F_3$ such that its factor is isomorphic to a given Abelian group,"On the upcoming test I will be given a problem of type: Find all normal subgroups $H$ in $F_n$ such that $F_n/H \cong G$ . Here $n$ is a small integer, likely 2 or 3, and $G$ is an Abelian group given as product of some cyclic groups. Question : is there a more-or-less routine algorithm for such problems? I do know an approach . I count two parameters : the number of epimorphisms $\#(F_n \twoheadrightarrow G)$ and the number of automorphisms $\#Aut(G)$ . The answer then is $\frac{\#(F_n\twoheadrightarrow G)}{\#Aut(G)}$ . This solution is based on the following facts: 1) every normal subgroup is a kernel of some homomorphism; 2) $F_n/Ker\,\phi \cong G$ if $\phi$ is an epimorphism; 3) $Ker\,\phi=Ker\,\psi$ iff $\psi = \alpha\circ\phi$ for some $\alpha \in Aut(G)$ . The problem is, very often I'm not sure how do I count one or both of these parameters . I could go through all homomorphisms and automorphisms manually, but the numbers in problem are usually too large. Here are some cases to show how big numbers might be on the actual test. No need to solve them! $n=3$ , $G=\mathbb Z_{13}^{3}$ $n=3$ , $G=\mathbb Z_{10}^3\times \mathbb Z$ $n=3$ , $G=\mathbb Z_{70}\times \mathbb Z_{30} \times \mathbb Z_{15}$ $n=2$ , $G=\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_5$ $n=3$ , $G=\mathbb Z_{55} \times \mathbb Z_{7} \times \mathbb Z_{77}$ $n=3$ , $G=\mathbb Z_{75} \times \mathbb Z_{375} \times \mathbb Z_{125} \times \mathbb Z_{333}$","['group-theory', 'cyclic-groups', 'free-groups', 'group-isomorphism']"

3884695,"Proving (via Hilbert's axioms) that, when two parallel lines are cut by a third line, they make congruent angles.","Prove that, when two parallel lines are cut by a third line, they make congruent angles. I'm not using Euclid's axioms, but instead I'm using Hilbert's. This is Theorem 19 of Hilbert's ""The Foundations of Geometry"" (PDF link via berkeley.edu) . Theorem 19. If two parallel lines are cut by a third straight line, the alternate-interior angles and also the exterior-interior angles are congruent. Conversely, if the alternate-interior or the exterior-interior angles are congruent, the given lines are parallel. The definition of parallel lines is simply two lines who don't meet. The definition of angle is a bit long it is on page 9. I think the important bit is that there is a bijection between angle and rays from a certain point and there is a congruence relation between them. And we have the (Playfair's) Axiom of Parallelism (page 7): Given a line $r$ and a point $A \notin r$ we can always draw one, and only one, line through $A$ parallel to $r$ . We can use that angles opposite on a vertex are congruent. My attempt was this: Given two concurrent lines $r$ and $s$ , s.t. $r \cap s = A$ let's take a point on $s$ different from $A$ and draw the one parallel line to $r$ from it, call it $h$ . suppose $\angle (h,s) < \angle (r,s)$ (this is not defined but it is not hard to come up with a definition either) and let $h'$ be the ray (line) such that $\angle (h',s) = \angle (h,s)$ can we prove that $h'$ is another parallel line or that it is line $s$ ? I think if we assume the angles formed are different than we would have two parallel lines through $B$ but I'm out of ideas. Please don't use Tarski's axioms, I don't know what a sum of angles is.","['axiomatic-geometry', 'angle', 'geometry', 'axioms']"
