490723,Double Summation Switch,"I have a question about switching the order of summation in this probability question.  I'll give the probability background, but it's not necessary to understand my question.  We have a random variable X that takes on nonnegative integer values.  We want to show that: $\operatorname{E}[X]=\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty P(X\geq i)$ We start off by noting that: $\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty P(X\geq i) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \sum\limits_{j=i}^\infty P(X = j). $ My question comes in at this next part:
$\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \sum\limits_{j=i}^\infty P(X = j) &=\sum\limits_{j=1}^\infty \sum\limits_{i=1}^j P(X = j)\\
\end{align}$ If I explicitly write out the first several terms of the left hand side, I can convince myself that these two double sums are indeed the same.  But is there an intuitive, heuristic way to see that these two sums are equivalent without explicitly writing out any terms? Thanks!

490753,Finest and Coarsest Equivalences,"According to a theorem in the Set Theory book I am reading, we can understand that equivalence relations partitons a set $X$ into distinct equivalence classes, $[x]$.  I get that, but one of the problems I have a question on. I think I grasp it, but help would be appreciated.  It states. Each equivalence relation on a set $X$ defines a partition.  What equivalence yields the finest partition?  The coarsest? So I was thinking of coarse as broad, so the equivalence congruence modulo $2$ struck me since this partitions the integers into $[0]$ and $[1]$.  However, the set here is only $\mathbb{Z}$.  Now the finest could be the equivalence $R$ where $(x,y)R(u,v)$ if $xv=yu$, since there are infinite equivalence classes then (as elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\gcd(a,b)=1$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$. Is this the right approach?  Is this the correct intuition of ""coarse"" and ""fine"" equivalences and are there coarser and finer equivalences? Is it subjective to the particular set being partitioned?","['equivalence-relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'set-partition']"

490836,Maximum and minimum values for a curve,"Considering the curve: $$
f(x) = x²

lim_{x -> 1} x² = lim_{x -> -1} x² = 1
$$ The minimum value is naturally $$
f(0) = 0² = 0
$$ However, I started wondering if thinking this way about the problem is wrong. Would it be more accurate to consider the problem as the whole curve $f$ having a maximum and a minimum in $-1 < x < 1$? Thus, arguing that it does NOT have a maximum in the interval (or any maximums at all, for that matter) but a minimum in $x = 0$, seeing as $$

490847,"Statement about Homotopy in Brown's ""Topology & Groupoids""","I am trying to understand a statement in Brown's Topology and Groupoids , 7.2.5 (Corollary 1), page 270. Let's first have some preliminary remarks Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces. The track groupoid $\pi Y^X$ is defined as the groupoid whose objects are the maps $f:X\to Y$ and morphism in $\pi Y^X(f,g)$ are the homotopies $f\simeq g,$ where two homotopies $F,G$ are identified if they can be continuously deformed into each other while fixing the end maps. For $X=\{*\}$ we obtain the fundamental groupoid $\pi Y.$ A map $i:A\to X$ induces a morphism $i^*:\pi Y^X\to\pi Y^A$ by $i^*([F])=[F(i\times 1)].$ Let $i:A\to X,\ u:A\to Y.$ By $[(X,i),(Y,u)]$ we mean the set of homotopy classes of maps $f:X\to Y,fi=u,$ where a homotopy $F:f\simeq g$ is required to satisfy $F(ia,t)=ua.$ (We say $f$ and $g$ are homotopic under $i.$) ( You might want to skip this shaded part as it's probably not relevant for the particular question. ): Let $p : E → B$ be a morphism of groupoids. We say $p$ is a fibration if the
  following condition holds: for all objects $x$ of $E$ and elements $b$ in $B$ with
  initial point $px,$ there is an element $e$ of $E$ with initial point $x$ and such that $pe = b.$ If $p : E → B$ is a morphism of groupoids and $u$ is an object of $B,$
  we write $p^{-1}[u]$ for the subgroupoid of $E$ with objects those $x$ in Ob$(E)$ such that $px = u,$ and with elements those $e$ in $E$ such that $pe = 1_u.$ Let $\pi_0G$ denote the set of components of $G.$ then we have: Lemma 1: If $p:E\to B$ is a fibration of groupoids, then for each $b\in B(u,v)$ there is a bijection $$b_\#:\pi_0 p^{-1}[u]\to\pi_0 p^{-1}[v]$$ which respects identities and composition. Namely, if $x$ is an object with $px=u$, we assign to the component of $x$ the component of the object $y$ which is the codomain of the element $e$ such that $pe=b.$ Lemma 2: A cofibration $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ induces a fibration
  $i^*:\pi Y^X\to\pi Y^A.$ Lemma 3: Let $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ be a cofibration. Let $u:A\to Y$ be a map. Let $p=i^∗:πY^X\to πY^A.$ Then there is a canonical bijection
  $$π_0 p^{−1}[u]\cong[(X, i), (Y, u)].$$ In the proof of the Lemma 3 we use the following fact. Maybe it turns out to be useful in solving my question: Lemma 4: Let $i:A→X$ be a cofibration. Let $H:X\times\Bbb I→Y$ be a homotopy $f≃g,$ and let $G=H(i\times1)$ be homotopic rel end maps to $G′:u≃v.$ Then $H$ is homotopic rel end maps to some $H′:f≃g$ such that $H'(i\times 1)=G'.$ Now we can combine the three lemmas to derive the following Corollary: Let $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ be a cofibration and $α\in πY^A(u,v).$ Then there is a bijection $$α_\#:[(X, i), (Y, u)] → [(X, i), (Y, v)]
$$ I have figured out that this bijection works as follows: Choose a representative $F$ of $\alpha.$ For a homotopy class $[f]$ take a representative $f:X\to Y,\ fi=u.$ The homotopy $F:u\simeq v$ on $A$ can be extended to a homotopy $G:f\simeq g'.$ Then we have $[g']=\alpha_\#([f]).$ Now, Brown writes Also, if $α_\#([f]) = [g],$ then any representative of $α$ extends to a homotopy $f\simeq g.$ I don't see why this should be obvious. I know that if $F:u\simeq v,\ F\in\alpha,$ then there is an extension of $f\cup F$ to a homotopy $G:f\simeq g'$ for some $g:X\to Y,\ g'i=v.$ And this $g'$ is homotopic under $i$ to $g.$ But I don't see how these homotopies can be combined to a homotopy $f\simeq g$ which extends $F.$","['general-topology', 'homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'groupoids']"

490863,Homework Problem: Complex Analysis Chain Rule,"My classmates and I were given that we had to verify, \begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (f \circ g) = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \circ g)(\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}) + (\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}} \circ g)(\frac{\partial \bar{g}}{\partial z})
\end{eqnarray} We are given the definition that $ \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y})$. This computation is quite tedious to verify and we end up with about 32 terms that needs to cancel out. For example, if $g = s(x,y) + it(x,y)$we have that the term $\frac{\partial g}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial s}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial t}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial s}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial t}{\partial y}$.

490896,Is there a flaw in this proof of Marty's theorem (normal families)?,"In Ahlfors' Complex Analysis text, page 227 the author claims that if the expression $$\rho(f)=\frac{2 |f'(z)|}{1+|f(z)|^2}$$ is locally bounded (here $f \in \mathfrak F$ is a family of meromorphic functions in some domain $\Omega$), then the family $\mathfrak F$ is equicontinuous (with respect to the spherical metric) on compact subsets of $\Omega$. In particular, he states that If $\rho(f) \leq M$ on the line segment between $z_1$ and $z_2$ we conclude that $d(f(z_1),f(z_2)) \leq M|z_1- z_2|$, and this immediately proves the equicontinuity when $\rho(f)$ is locally bounded. I believe that he intended that we start the formula for the length $$L=\int_\gamma \rho(f) |dz| $$
where $\gamma$ is the line segment between $z_1$ and $z_2$, and apply the triangle inequality. My problem with this proof is that $f$ might not even be defined on that line segment (if $\Omega$ is not convex), and in that case the integral formula is invalid. Is this proof correct after all? If so, what am I missing here? Thanks.","['normal-families', 'complex-analysis']"
490907,Product of monic polynomials in a Function Field,"I'm trying to prove that given $P$ is a monic irreducible over $\Bbb F_q[t]$ and $d=\deg(P)$, then $$\prod_{\substack{f\text{ monic}\\ 0\leq\deg(f)<d}}f=\pm1\pmod{P}.$$My first thought goes to using the analog of Wilson's Theorem over function fields, but it doesn't require the polynomials to be monic. At this point, I thought that every polynomial can be written as $\alpha f$ where $\alpha\in\Bbb F_q^\ast$ and $f$ is monic. Combining all of these, I got $$\prod_{\substack{f\text{ monic}\\ 0\leq\deg(f)<d}}\left(f^{q-1}\prod_{\alpha\in\Bbb F_q^\ast}\alpha\right)=(-1)^d\left(\prod_{\substack{f\text{ monic}\\0\leq\deg(f)<d}}f\right)^{q-1}=-1\pmod{P}.$$So I can divide the $(-1)^{d-1}$ over, but the $q-1$ power throws me off.

""$dA$"" seems to be something that if we integrated it, we should end up with the surface area of $\Sigma$ (I would like to think of it like ""parameterizing by arclength"".) But if we integrate $dudv$, we end up with the area in the parameter space. OK, so perhaps the $dA$ refers to the area of the parameter space. But then here on Wikipedia I find the statement $$\iiint _V (\nabla \cdot F) dV = \iint_{S} F \cdot n \,dS.$$ which I read as translating $$\int_V (f_x + g_y + h_z) dx dy dz \\=\int_V d(f\, dy dz + g \,dz dx + h \,dx dy) + \int_{\partial V}f\, dy dz + g \,dz dx + h \,dx dy.$$ Surely this $dS$ here does not refer to any particular parameterization space...?

\partial_1f_1+\partial_2f_2=1\\

I managed to solve three special cases. Case 1. If the projections have the same range, say it's not the $y$ axis, then assuming $U$ is convex $f$ is of the form
$$f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
g(y-mx)+x\\
m\cdot g(y-mx)+mx+c

for arbitrary $c,m\in\mathbb{R}$ and differentiable function $g\colon\{y-mx\mid(x,y)\in U\}\to\mathbb{R}$. Hence
$$Df(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
1-m\cdot g'(y-mx) & g'(y-mx)\\
m-m^2\cdot g'(y-mx) & m\cdot g'(y-mx)
\end{bmatrix}.$$ Case 2. If the projections have the same kernel, say it's not the $x$ axis, then assuming $U$ is convex $f$ is of the form
$$f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
x+my-m\cdot g(x+my)+c\\
g(x+my)
\end{bmatrix}$$
for arbitrary $c,m\in\mathbb{R}$ and differentiable function $g\colon\{x+my\mid(x,y)\in U\}\to\mathbb{R}$. Hence
$$Df(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
1-m\cdot g'(x+my) & m-m^2\cdot g'(x+my)\\
g'(x+my) & m\cdot g'(x+my)
\end{bmatrix}.$$ Case 3. If the projections are all orthogonal, in which case $f$ is locally the gradient of some functions $\phi_V\colon U\supset V\to\mathbb{R}$, the only solutions are
$$f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
mx\pm y\sqrt{m(1-m)}+a\\
(1-m)y\pm x\sqrt{m(1-m)}+b

for arbitrary $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $m\in[0,1]$. Hence
$$Df(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}
m & \pm\sqrt{m(1-m)}\\
\pm\sqrt{m(1-m)} & 1-m
\end{bmatrix}.$$ Naturally $f$ maps into a translation of the shared range in Case 1, and is locally constant along the shared kernel in Case 2. But I couldn't find a solution where the two subspaces varied ""independently"". That is: Can the function
$$U\to\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})\times\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R});\quad(x,y)\mapsto(RanDf(x,y),KerDf(x,y))$$

is necessary to make $\left(X,A\right)$ a pair having the homotopy
extension property (HEP). In Note on cofibrations written in 1966
by Arne Strøm I meet the remark that it is sufficient
under the extra condition that $A$ is closed. In Hatcher's Algebraic
Topology it is shown that this extra condition can be dropped. Who
was the first to find that out, and when did that happen? My last comment is not immediately visible on my screen and I do not
want to miss this opportunity. So here I repeat it (probably unnecessary)
as an addition of my original question. Indeed, as professor Brown remarked, that is what the
debate is about: if $X\times\left\{ 0\right\} \cup A\times\mathbb{I}$
is a retract of $X\times\mathbb{I}$ then the pair $\left(X\times\left\{ 0\right\} ,A\times\mathbb{I}\right)$
has the gluing property. Professor Brown, I would like to attend you
on a nice consequence of the proof. In Topology and Groupoids (nice
book!) 7.2.4 it is shown that $1_{B}\times i$ is a cofibration if
$i$ is, but this under the extra condition that $B$ is locally compact.
This extra condition can be left out! If $X\times\left\{ 0\right\} \cup A\times\mathbb{I}$
is a retract of $X\times\mathbb{I}$ then $B\times X\times\left\{ 0\right\} \cup B\times A\times\mathbb{I}$

491723,Is exponentiation defined for non-self-adjoint operators?,"In a book I am reading (Blank, Exner, Havlíček: Hilbert Space Operators in Quantum Mechanics), functions of operators are defined via spectral decomposition for self-adjoint operators. Spectral decomposition is also well-defined for unitary operators so I expect functions over these could also be defined analogously. Then, however, throughout quantum mechanics, one often encounters exponentials of operators which are neither and not even normal, like the annihilation operator (with spectrum equal to $\mathbb{C}$) or the creation operator (whose spectrum is empty, AFAIK). This is usually understood in terms of the Taylor expansion, $$\exp A = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \frac1{n!} A^n$$ which in the relevant contexts turns out to be easy enough to apply term-wise when $\exp A$ acts on a vector. This is obviously a work-around with many dangerous pitfalls, keeping in mind that Taylor expansion does not work properly even in the ""canonical"" uses of exponential (take, for example, $$\exp \left( a \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \right) f(x) \ne f(x+a)$$ for functions which are $C^\infty$ but not analytic). My question is, is there a way of defining exponentiation rigorously for a broader class of operators? For example, if we know the spectrum and all eigenvectors of an operator, and those span the entire space (like the annihilation operator), would it be true to say its exponential is an operator with the same eigenvectors corresponding to $e$ raised to the respective eigenvalues? What would then happen in the case of the creation operator?",['functional-analysis']
491727,How does a geometry-oriented mind learn analysis?,"I find it very difficult to understand analysis, because I can't find a way to learn it geometrically. To make my point clearer, let me take calculus as the example in contrast. I find calculus very geometric and I'm very comfortable with it, to name a few famous examples: Newton-Leibniz theorem: a strip under the graph of a (continuous)function, divided by its width, will approach the value of the height as width goes to 0; L'Hospital's Rule: if two functions are approaching 0 at the same point, as we approach that point, the ratio of the heights of the two graphs will be the same as the ratio of the slopes, because $\text{height}\approx \text{slope}\times\Delta x$, and $\Delta x$ is the same for both graphs. I can keep going, and in fact, most of the important theorems in calculus have such geometric intepretations. I'm aware that there are technicalities that cannot be captureed by the above geometric arguments, but I believe they are still very to the point and I feel I can never forget them. It seems to be another story for analysis(especially real analysis). Although occasionally there are important content that can be understood geometrically, more often I encounter theorems and concepts that after quite some struggling still no firm geometric intuition can be developed. A lot of times some partial intuition can be developed, but usually trusting these partial intuitions will quickly get myself into errors. I can follow most of the analysis textbooks, i.e. all their logical deductions, proving theorems etc. but the problem is, when I can't form pictures, I can't find positions in my mind for these knowledge, so although I have read a considerable amount of analysis(and done quite some exercises), not much can be ""triggered"" from my mind when I see a analysis-related problem , say, 4 months after I stop reading an analysis book. In fact, I post the question here only after reading Poincare's Intuition and Logic in Mathematics , before reading this I assumed everyone thinks in the geometric way so if I can't understand analysis I probably should just try harder. It's quite a headache to me because nothing else(calculus, linear algebra, modern differential geometry etc.) has caused this much of discomfort. Now I'm wondering if I've learnt analysis in a wrong way, any comments or suggestions?","['geometry', 'intuition', 'real-analysis']"

x must assume the values:$\ -9 \lt x \lt  -2.4375 $ upon intersecting this with the range we get the same result and this is the (apparent) final solution. We then resume to the usual manipulation of the inequality; squaring both sides, factoring etc. We get two roots; $-9$,$ -2.4375$ . The parabola we get after these manipulations is concave, so we get the solution:  $\ -9 \lt x \lt  -2.4375 $ .  We then intersect this solution with the range for x, yielding the final solution  $\ -9 \lt x \lt  -2.4375 $. Upon testing it we find it does not fulfill the inequality we tried to solve, so we cancel it as a solution, leading to that there are no solutions to this inequality, as a final answer.

whose existence is justified when $M$ is non-empty by imposing the condition that x be a member of some set in $M$ and applying the subset axiom scheme.

492038,Interpretation of potential kernels for Markov processes,"One can associate a strongly continuous contraction semi group (SCCSG) to a Markov process with state space $S$ through its transition function, say $P_t$.

Now I encountered the definition of the corresponding potential kernel as $U = \int_0^{\infty} P_t dt.$ And I am not sure, how to interpret its actions, since I couldn't find an helpful definition. So, how do I interpret the notation $\mu U$ or $U P_s$ or even $\mu P_s U$? I think, since $P_t$ is a bounded linear operator, so should U also be a linear operator
and thus $U P_s$ seems to be defined as the linear Operator $f\mapsto \int_0^{\infty} (P_t P_s)(f) dt=\int_0^{\infty} (P_{t+s})(f) dt.$ But then, what are $\mu U$ and $\mu P_s U$? Are they, according to the definition of the measure $(\mu P_t)(\cdot)$, 
also measures, namely
$\int_0^{\infty} (\mu P_t)(\cdot) dt$  [Is this finite/ $\sigma$-finite?] and consequently $\begin{aligned}\int_0^{\infty} [(\mu P_s) P_t](\cdot) dt&=\int_0^{\infty} \int_S \left(\int_S \mu(dy) P_s(y, x)\right) P_t(x,\cdot) dt\\
&= \int_0^{\infty} \int_S \mu(dy)P_{s+t}(y,\cdot) dt=\int_s^{\infty} (\mu P_t)(\cdot) dt
\end{aligned},$ is that right? One further question or rather thoughts:
What is the connection between resolvent wrt $P_t$ and the potential kernel defined above? I mean,  heuristically the potential kernel is the case $\lambda = 0$ in the $e^{-\lambda t}$-term of the resolvent. But wasn't this case particularly excluded due to convergence issues?
Is this connected to the transience of the process? Perhaps, the resolvent is defined only for $\lambda>0$ for existence reasons, since at $\lambda=0$ one has to restrict to transient processes? I don't know, but I would like to know .","['probability-theory', 'potential-theory', 'markov-process']"

Then I took a look at the more general form: $$x^{x^{{x}^{\iddots}}} = p.$$ I then concluded that $x = (p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$ , and this was the solution set for all $p$ . Then I thought for a while and determined that there are multiple values where this function equals the square root of $2$ , so it's not injective. However, this led to an awkward statement based on the fact that $\sqrt{2} = (4)^{\frac{1}{4}}$ . We deduce the following: The equation $x^{x^{{x}^{\iddots}}} = 2$ and the equation $x^{x^{{x}^{\iddots}}} = 4$ have the same solution, namely $x = \sqrt{2}$ . So we conclude that $2 = 4$ .
