1601158,How can we find geodesics on a one sheet hyperboloid?,"I am looking at the following exercise: Describe four different geodesics on the hyperboloid of one sheet
$$x^2+y^2-z^2=1$$ passing through the point $(1, 0, 0)$. $$$$ We have that a curve $\gamma$ on a surface $S$ is called a geodesic if $\ddot\gamma(t)$ is zero or perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at the point $\gamma (t)$, i.e., parallel to its unit normal, for all values of the parameter $t$. Equivalently, $\gamma$ is a geodesic if and only if its tangent vector $\dot\gamma$ is parallel along $\gamma$. $$$$ Could you give me some hints how we can find in this case the geodesics?","['differential-geometry', 'surfaces', 'geodesic']"
1601167,"Why do we need both partial derivatives for $f(x, y)$ to guarantee that we can find min & max points?","Given for example a function of 2 variables $z = f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2$, I believe there are infinitely many directions on the $xy$ plane in which we could take partial derivatives (this could already be wrong...). If we differentiate $z$ w.r.t $x$, we get $f_x = 2x+y$. If we set this partial derivative equal to zero, we get infinitely many solutions; namely it seems that for any value of $y$, we could find a value of $x$ such that at the point $(x,y)$ the slope in the direction of the $x$ axis would be zero. However, only one of these infinitely many points is actually the minimum of the function. But if we take the other partial derivative $f_y = 2y + x$ and set both of them equal to zero as a system of equations and solve that system, we will get our minimum point at $(0,0)$. Why is that? Why is it that we need both partial derivatives and not fewer, or especially more ? EDIT: Just to make it clear, I'm wondering both why two PD's are the minimum, and also why they are guaranteed to be enough (as in, why don't we need 20 PD's?).","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative']"
1601215,Finding the number of normals to a parabola,"Find the number of normals to the parabola $y^2=8x$ through (2,1) $$$$ I tried as follows: Any normal to the parabola will be of the form $$y=mx-am^3-2am$$ Since the point (2,1) lies on the normal, it satisfies the equation of the normal. Thus $$2m^3+2m+1=0$$ The number of real roots of $m$ in the above equation would indicate the number of normals which satisfy the condition given in the question. However, I got stuck while trying to manually calculate the roots. I would be grateful if somebody could please show me a more efficient method of solving the question.

1601306,"Dimension of variety $V(I)$ where $I=\langle xy,xz \rangle\in k[x,y,z]$ and $k$ is an infinite field.","I have some doubts about this question although I know the answer is $2$ . The dimension of an affine variety is defined in many different ways. One of the definitions defines it as the maximum dimension of the coordinate subspaces if it is a union of a finite number of linear subspaces of $k^n$ . It is very easy to see from this definition that the dimension of $V(I)$ is $2$ . Now the problem I was doing in the book Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by Cox et al. asks the following: (a) Show that $I\cap k[x]=0$ , but that $I\cap k[x,y]$ and $I\cap k[x,z]$ are not $0$ . (b) Show that $I\cap k[y,z]=0$ , but that $I\cap k[x,y,z]\ne 0$ (c) What do you conclude about the dimension of $V(I)$ ? Using Groebner basis, it is easy to show (a) and (b). I am confused about (c) though. It looks as if the author wants to use the following definition to conclude that $\dim (V(I))=2$ : The dimension of $V$ is the largest integer $r$ for which there exist $r$ variables $x_{i_1},\dots, x_{i_r}$ such that $I(V)\cap k[x_{i_1}, \dots,x_{i_r}]=\{0\}$ . I don't see how to use this definition in this case, since our $I$ is an arbitrary ideal defining $V$ instead of $I(V)$ . Also $k$ is not necessarily algebraically closed. So what does the question (c) mean? Thank you for any help!","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
1601310,Generalization of Urysohn's Lemma,"Urysohn's lemma in general topology states: A topological space $X$ is normal (i.e., $T_4$) iff, for each pair of disjoint closed subsets $C, D \subset X$, there is a function $f : X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(C) = 0$ and $f(D) = 1$. Of course Urysohn's proof relies heavily on the structure of $[0, 1]$, to go through, but I wondered how necessary this is.  In particular, let's say A space $Y$ is said to ""have property $\mathscr{U}$"" if, for every compact Hausdorff space $X$, and every pair of disjoint subsets $C, D \subset X$, there exists a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ such that there are $y_1 \neq y_2 \in Y$ with $f(C) = y_1$ and $f(D) = y_2$. Question: Can we characterize those spaces with property $\mathscr{U}$? Urysohn's lemma says that any space containing a line segment has property $\mathscr{U}$.  Is this sufficient condition in fact necessary? (Of course we could define a similar property replacing ""compact Hausdorff"" with ""normal.""  I'm directly interested in the former situation, but I don't have any idea which is the ""correct"" definition to make.) Motivation: I've recently learned the following cute result: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $F$ be a topological field.  Then there is a continuous bijection
$$\varphi : X \to \operatorname{MaxSpec} C(X, F),$$
where the space on the right is endowed with the Zariski topology.  Of course $\varphi^{-1}$ will usually be far from continuous, since the Zariski topology is fairly weak.  However, when $F = \mathbb{R}$ then $\varphi$ is a homeomorphism.  To see this, we verify directly that $\varphi$ is a closed map using Urysohn's lemma. I'm wondering if this allows us to give a characterization of the real numbers as a topological field that's essentially different from the usual ones.",['general-topology']

It's easy to see that $d(c, p) < d(c, a) = d(c, b)$. Is the same true of a geodesic triangle on a surface $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^3$? In this case we consider the intrinsic metric $d_{\Sigma}$ defined by shortest paths on the surface $\Sigma$. We then define the 'perpendicular bisector' as the set of all points equidistant to $a, b \in \Sigma$ with respect to the metric $d_{\Sigma}$. (See right figure.)

1601403,Sawyer's proof that a certain lim sup of sets has full measure,"Given $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ a probability space, let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $\mu$-invariant measurable functions, closed under composition, with the following property: If $A$ is a measurable set such that $A = T^{-1} (A)$ modulo null-sets for every $T$ in $\mathcal{F}$, then either $\mu(A) = 0$ or $\mu(A) = 1$. The objective is to conclude the following Lemma: Given a collection $\left\{ E_{n} \right\}_{n \geq 1}$  of measurable
  sets satisfying $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu (E_{n}) = \infty$, there
  exists $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{n}, \ldots \in \mathcal{F}$ such that: \begin{equation*} \mu \left( \bigcap_{N \geq 1} \bigcup_{n \geq N}
 T^{-1}_{n} (E_{n})\right) = \mu \left( \limsup_{n \geq 1} T^{-1}_{n}
 (E_{n}) \right) \end{equation*} has full measure in $X$. This strongly resembles of Borel-Cantelli's theorem, and the proof provided indeed follows the same line of thought as in the theorem's proof. It relies on the following result: Under the hypotheses in the definition, given any two measurable sets $A, B$ and any constant $\theta > 1$, one may find $T \in \mathcal{F}$ satisfying $\mu \left(A \cap T^{-1} (B) \right) \leq \theta \mu (A) \mu (B)$. Thus, if $A_{n} = E_{n}^{\mathrm{c}}$ and we choose arbitrary $T_{1} \in \mathcal{F}$, $\theta_{1} > 1$, substituting A for $T_{1}^{-1} (A_{1})$ and $B$ for $A_{2}$, the aforementioned result yields $T_{2} \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $$\mu \left( T^{-1}_{1} (A_{1}) \cap T^{-1}_{2} (A_{2}) \right) \leq \theta_{1} \mu (A_{1}) \mu (A_{2}).$$ In general, we proceed inductively: at step $m$ choose arbitrary $\theta_{m} > 1$ and take $A$ as $T^{-1}_{1} (A_{1}) \cap \ldots \cap T^{-1}_{m} (A_{m})$, $B$ as $A_{m+1}$, obtaining $T_{m+1}$ such that:
\begin{equation}
\mu \left( \bigcap_{n=1}^{m+1} T^{-1}_{n} (A_{n}) \right) \leq \left( \prod_{n=1}^{m} \theta_{n} \right) \prod_{n=1}^{m+1} \left( 1 - \mu(E_{n}) \right) 
\end{equation} Now, the above inequality is exactly of the kind used in Borel-Cantelli's proof. As long as we pick $(\theta_{n})_{n \geq 1}$ in such a way that its product converges, the above estimate allows us to conclude that $\mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} T^{-1}_{n} (E_{n}) \right) = 1$. The problem, however, is that we'd like this conclusion to actually hold for $\bigcup_{n = N}^{\infty} T^{-1}_{n} (E_{n})$. One cannot simple repeat the previous construction starting from $T^{-N} (A_{N})$, since this could possibly yield a different sequence $\left( T_{n} \right)_{n \geq N}$ at each time. The author stops the proof right here, claiming that this conclusion is sufficient to: (1) Choose integers $N_{k}$ with the property that $$\mu \left( \bigcup_{n = N_{k}}^{N_{k+1}} T^{-1}_{n} (E_{n}) \right) \geq 1 - 1/k^2$$ and, (2) From (1) conclude that $$\bigcup_{n = N}^{\infty} T^{-1}_{n} (E_{n})$$ has full measure for every $N$. Now, I can see why (1) implies (2). However, I haven't been able to conclude (1). Does it follow simply from the inequality obtained and some measure-theoretical argument or could it use some specific property of the family $\mathcal{F}$? Any help would be appreciated.

Sawyer, http://www.jstor.org/stable/1970516 , p. 165, although I've changed the notation to a more contemporary one.","['borel-cantelli-lemmas', 'probability-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'measure-theory']"

Hartshorne claims $x$ is the generic point of $\pi ^{-1} (y)$. Its local ring $\mathcal{O}_x \cong \mathcal{O}_Y [t] _{m_y}$ is clearly a DVR because $\mathcal{O}_Y$ is a DVR.

In addition, I have attempted my own alternative proof and I hope if someone can proofread it and also compare it to the quoted proof by Hartshorne. Reduce to the affine case so $X = \textrm{Spec } A$ and $x$ corresponds to some $p \subset A[t]$. Then being of type I, $\textrm{ht} (p) = 1$, $p' = p \cap A \ne 0$, $p = p' A[t]$. Note that
  $$A[t]_p = (A_{p'}[t])_p $$

1601775,Confusion regarding notation of a dual transformation,"I'm reading Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds and in Chapter 4 he defines the dual transformation (although he doesn't call it that) as follows: If $f:V \rightarrow W$ is a linear transformation, a linear transformation $f^* : \mathfrak{I}^k (W) \rightarrow \mathfrak{I}^k (V)$ is defined by $f^* T (v_1, \dots, v_k) = T(f(v_1),\dots,f(v_k))$ for $T \in \mathfrak{I}^k (W)$ and $v_1, \dots, v_k \in V$. Here, $\mathfrak{I}^k (V)$ denotes the set of all $k$-tensors on $V$. My confusion is with the next statement that he makes: It is easy to verify that $f^*(S \otimes T) = f^*S \otimes f^*T$. Here, $S$ would be a $k$-tensor on $W$ and $T$ would be an $l$-tensor on $W$. So, on the L.H.S. $f^*$ denotes the map from $\mathfrak{I}^{k+l} (W)$ to $\mathfrak{I}^{k+l} (V)$. But, on the R.H.S. the first $f^*$ denotes the map from $\mathfrak{I}^k (W)$ to $\mathfrak{I}^k (V)$ and the second $f^*$ denotes the map from $\mathfrak{I}^l (W)$ to $\mathfrak{I}^l (V)$. Is this notation standard, so that the dimension of the space on which $f^*$ acts is to be understood from the context? Since we really have three different functions in this equation, is it still appropriate to say that $f^*$ 'distributes over $\otimes$'?","['tensor-products', 'notation', 'tensors', 'multilinear-algebra', 'multivariable-calculus']"

So far, this is what I have: I know that $U$ is equal in distribution to $Z/\|Z\|_2$, where $Z$ is an $n$-dimensional standard gaussian vector. Thus, $U_1$ is equal in distribution to $Z_1/\|Z\|_2$.

$$P[U_1\leq t]=P\big[Z_1\leq\|Z\|_2t\big],$$

1602085,"Modules over associative algebras are just special cases of ""ordinary"" modules over rings?","By module over a ring, I mean always a right-module. All rings are supposed to be unital, and the module fulfills $m\cdot 1 = m$. If $R$ is commutative and $M$ a right-module, we can define $rx := xr$ and get also a left-module. In this situation we call $M$ a bimodule, and if not otherwise said this natural definition is applied if I speak of bimodules. An algebra $A$ over a commutative ring $R$ is itself a ring with $1$, which is also a $R$-module, and such that for all $r \in R$ and $x,y \in A$ we have
$$
 (rx)y = r(xy) = x(ry).
$$
As the ring is assumed to be commutative, we essentially have a bimodul over $R$ as written above. A module $M$ over an algebra $A$ which is defined over some ring $R$ is itself an $R$-module, for which we have an operation $M \times A \to M$ such that
for each $u, v \in M$ and $x,y \in A$ and $r \in R$ we have (1) $(u+v)x = ux + vx$ (2) $v(x+y) = vx + vy$ (3) $(vx)y = v(xy)$ (4) $v1 = v$ (5) $(rv)x = r(vx) = v(rx)$. This is the standard definition I see everywhere. But I guess I observed the following. For an algebra we can embed $R$ into $A$ by identifying it with $R\cdot 1$ for $1 \in A$. So the assertion that $A$ must be an $R$-module is implied by (1), (2), (3) and (4). So we can just define a module over an algebra as an ordinary module over $A$ seen as a ring with $1$. As $A$ is in general not commutative, this is just a right-module. But by the embedding, and the additional requirement for an algebra, every element of $R$ is in the center $Z(A) = \{ x : xy = yx \mbox{ for all y} \in A \}$, restricted to $R$ everything is fine and we again have a bimodule. So the only thing that makes modules over algebras special here is (5). But here we have
\begin{align*}
 (rv)x & = (vr)x & \mbox{definition of $M$ as bimodul over $R$} \\
       & = v(rx) & \mbox{by (3)} \\
       & = v(xr) & \mbox{$R$ is central in $A$} \\
       & = (vx)r & \mbox{by (3)} \\
       & = r(vx) & \mbox{definition of $M$ as bimodul over $R$}
\end{align*}
so we see that in the third and last line we have recovered everything from (5). So as I see it, a module over an algebra is just an ordinary module over the algebra seen as a ring, so why bother with these extra definition? I guess if we generalise further, for example look at non-associative algebras, then they are no longer rings and we cannot define modules over them as special cases of modules over rings. But most of the time (and in the textbooks I am reading right now) such generalizations are not considered, but nevertheless most of the time modules over algebras are defined separately to modules over rings. So why that? Or have I overlooked something and my computations are wrong?

I'm interested in whether there's a way to use that proof with Pythagoras to prove the general $a_n$ case (for this, hints are appreciated rather than complete proofs), and also in other ways (algebraic, geometric, number theoric, calculusic...anything) that you might know or come up with to prove the general case (for those, either hints or complete proofs are great, up to you). Lemma : Let positive (edited) real numbers $a_1, a_2$ be the legs of a right triangle. Then $\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2}$ is the length of the hypothenuse of that triangle. And $\sqrt{a_1^2} + \sqrt{a_2^2}$ is the sum of the length of the two legs. By the triangular inequality, we know that the length of the hypothenuse has to be less than the length of the sum of the two legs. Therefore, for any real numbers $a_1, a_2$, $\sqrt{a_1^2} + \sqrt{a_2^2} > \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2}$. I'm stuck here...I was thinking of comparing pairs of elements from each side of the expression using my lemma, but it doesn't seem possible to ""extract"" pairs of elements from under $\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 +...+a_n^2}$.
I also thought about summing all elements but $a_1$ into a single number and using my lemma on those simplified expressions, but I run into the same problem.","['inequality', 'alternative-proof', 'proof-verification', 'geometry']"

1602419,Liouville's theorem and the Wronskian,"Liouville's theorem states that under the action of the equations of motion, the phase volume is conserved. The equations of motion are the flow ODE's generated by a Hamiltonian field $X$ and the solutions to Hamilton's equations are the integral curves of the system. The effect of a symplectomorphism $\phi_t$ is that it would take $(p^i,q_i) \to (p^j,q_j)$ or $\omega \to \omega'$ and that would be the contribution of the Jacobian of the transformation. If the flow $\phi_t$ changes variables from time, say, $t$ to time $0$. The Jacobian would be
$$ J(t) = \left| \begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial p_1(t) }{\partial p_1(0) }  & \ldots & \frac{\partial  p_1(t) }{\partial q_{n}(0) }  \\
\vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots  \\
\frac{\partial p_{n}(t)  }{\partial q_1(0) }  &\ldots & \frac{\partial q_{n}(t)  }{\partial q_{n}(0)  } \ 
\end{array} \right| $$
Now, the derivatives appearing in the Jacobian satisfy a linear system of ordinary differential equations and moreover, viewed as a system of ordinary differential equations, it is easy to see that the Jacobian we need is also the Wronskian $W$ for the system of differential equations. My first question is why is this true? I know that the definition of the Wronskian of two differential functions $f,g$ is $W(f,g)=f'g-g'f$. Then I read that Wroskian's of linear equations satisfy the vector ODE
\item Wroskian's of linear equations satisfy the vector ODE
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dt}{\bf{y}} = {\bf{M}}(t) {\bf{y}}
\end{equation*} What exactly is this equation? Then I read that
\begin{equation*}
W(t) = W(0) \exp\left( \int_0^t dt \, \text{Tr}{\bf{M}}(0) \right)
\end{equation*}
and for our case this trace vanishes, thus $J(0)=J(t)=1$ which shows that the contribution of the Jacobian over volume integrals is trivial. Can you help me to understand the above statements? Unfortunately I have lost the reference out of which I read those.","['symplectic-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

This question is similar to my previous question concerning a circular room, but I want to focus on the harder part of regular polygons. This is like a single point inside of a regular polygon, say a triangle, being the endpoint of a ray.  The ray goes away from the point in a random direction and reflects off the sides of the triangle (staying inside the triangle).  Will it ever return to its original point?  If so, will it return infinitely or definitely?  Will it return to the original point in the original direction?

Using the width / face slope I tried calculating $AQ$ by creating a new triangle halving the $PAQ$ face with a height of $2$ and width of $1$ which gives $AQ$ as $2.2$. The length $QC$ comes out as $2$ using Pythagoras. These values for the triangle $ACQ$ give me an angle of $24.6$ degrees which is incorrect. I think either my idea of substitution is wrong or the way I'm breaking up the structure. Any ideas / hints would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

1602804,Poincare's lemma for 1-form,"Let $\omega=f(x,y,z)dx+g(x,y,z)dy+h(x,y,z)dz$ be a differentiable 1-form in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $d\omega=0$. Define $\hat{f}:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbb{R}$ by $$\hat{f}(x,y,z)=\int_{0}^{1}{(f(tx,ty,tz)x+g(tx,ty,tz)y+h(tx,ty,tz)z)dt}.$$ Show that $d\hat{f}=\omega$. My approach: If $d\omega=0$, then $$\left(\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x}-\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)dx\wedge dy+\left(\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x}-\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)dx\wedge dz+\left(\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial y}-\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial z}\right)dy\wedge dz=0,$$ therefore $\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x}=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x}=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z},\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial y}=\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial z}$. For the other hand, note that $$f(x,y,z)=\int_{0}^{1}{\dfrac{d}{dt}(f(tx,ty,tz)t)dt}=\int_{0}^{1}{f(tx,ty,tz)dt}+\int_{0}^{1}{t\dfrac{d}{dt}(f(tx,ty,tz))dt}$$ where $$\dfrac{d}{dt}(f(tx,ty,tz))=x\dfrac{df}{dx}(tx,ty,tz)+y\dfrac{df}{dy}(tx,ty,tz)+z\dfrac{df}{dz}(tx,ty,tz).$$ But now, I have trouble with the differential of $\hat{f}$. Then for the above equations I think we can prove $d\hat{f}=\omega$.","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry', 'exterior-algebra']"

1602946,Showing $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int f^n$ converges,"I am having trouble solving a real analysis qualifying exam problem. The question assumes $\mu(X) < \infty$ and $\left| f \right| < 1$ (EDIT: Assume $f$ is real-valued).  We are to show that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X 1 + f + \dots + f^n d\mu$$ exists, possibly equal to $\infty$. My work so far. Each integral in the sequence makes sense since $\int 1 + \left| f \right| + \dots + \left| f \right|^n < (n+1) \mu(X) < \infty$.  Rephrasing the problem, we want to show $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int f^n$ converges.  It is immediate by the Monotone Convergence Theorem that the result is true for nonnegative functions $f$.  Considering absolute convergence, we have $$\sum \left| \int f^n \right| \leq \sum \int \left| f \right|^n$$ where the series on the right converges by what we just said.  If said series is finite, then $\sum \int f^n$ converges absolutely, hence converges. Question. I am stuck on the case that $$ \sum \int \left| f \right|^n = \infty. \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (*)$$ I know from the statement of the problem that we are allowing for $\sum \int f^n = \infty$, but it is not clear to me whether this should follow from $(*)$.  We do know $$\sum \int \left| f \right|^n = \int \sum \left| f \right|^n = \frac{1}{1 - \left| f \right|}.$$  So if this equals $\infty$, then $\mu \left\{ x \colon \left| f(x) \right| > 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right\} > 0$ for all $n$.  And of course $\sum f^n = \frac{1}{1 - f}$ as well.  But I can't see how to put this all together. Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

with $\alpha \in (1,2]$. I am trying to prove mathematically my empirical result that if $\alpha_1<\alpha_2$ then $$\int_{-\infty}^x F_{\alpha_1}(z)dz\geq\int_{-\infty}^x F_{\alpha_2}(z)dz, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}\quad \forall \alpha_1,\alpha_2 \in (1,2]$$
which according to Ruszczynski and Dencheva (2003) is equivalent to
$$\int_{-\infty}^x (x-z)f_{\alpha_1} (z) \, dz\geq\int_{-\infty}^x (x-z) f_{\alpha_2} (z)  dz, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}\quad \forall \alpha_1,\alpha_2 \in (1,2].$$ To solve the problem, it is enough to prove one of them. 
When solving the first inequality, we end up with tripple integrals while we will end up with double integrals if we solve the second inequality. $$$$

PS1. We denote $\int_{-\infty}^x (x-z)f_{\alpha}(z)\,dz$ with $F_{\alpha}^{(2)}(x)$, i.e.
$$F_{\alpha}^{(2)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^x F_{\alpha}(z)\,dz=\int_{-\infty}^x (x-z)f_{\alpha}(z)\,dz$$ PS2. $f_{\alpha}(x)$ and $F_{\alpha}(x)$ are the density and distribution function of a stable random variable $X \sim S_{\alpha}(1,0,0)$ respectively. See

But this feels wrong. Specifically, the step of taking ""${\lim_{x\rightarrow 1}[x-1]}$"" over to the right hand side seems illegal. I justify this to myself by saying we can treat it like a number not equal to zero because it is a limit. But I don't believe my justification.",['limits']
