205737,Formal definition of *not* uniformly continuous,"The definition for uniform continuity for a function $f : X \to Y$ is that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $d_Y(f(p),f(q)) < \epsilon$ for all $p,q \in X$ such that $d_X(p,q) < \delta$. Mathematically, we can write this definition as $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \textrm{ such that } d_Y(f(p),f(q) < \epsilon\ \forall p,q \in X \textrm{ for which } d_X(p,q) < \delta.$ I have learned that when negating a statement, one switches the quantifiers, and reverses any equality/inequality statements in the conclusion. Following these rules, the definition for not uniformly continuous would be $\exists \epsilon > 0\ \forall \delta > 0 \textrm{ such that } d_Y(f(p),f(q)) \ge \epsilon\ \exists p,q \in X \textrm{ for which } d_X(p,q) < \delta.$ This, however makes little sense as written. I believe that I would be better served writing this as $\exists p,q \in X \textrm{ such that } \forall \delta > 0 \textrm { for which } d_X(p,q) < \delta, \exists \epsilon > 0 \textrm{ such that } d_Y(f(p),f(q)) \ge \epsilon.$ My question is: does my latter define criteria for which a function is not uniformly continuous? In other words, is this a proper negation of the definition? I believe that it should provide a criteria for a function not being uniformly continuous, but is this the same thing as the wholesale negation of the definition?","['continuity', 'real-analysis']"
205748,"Consider the sequence defined: $a_1=0, a_{n+1}=3+\sqrt{11+a_n}$, show that is bounded above and increasing using induction.","Consider the sequence defined: $a_1=0, a_{n+1}=3+\sqrt{11+a_n}$
a) Show, using induction, that this sequence is bounded above by 14; b) prove that the sequence is increasing; c) Why must it converge?; d)Find the limit. So for part a), I have: Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $a_n \leq 14$.
Consider $P(1)$, where $n=1$.  Then $0 \leq 14$, which is indeed true.
Now assume that $P(k)$ is true for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $a_k \leq 14$  Then for $P(k+1)$: $a_{k+1}=3+\sqrt{11+a_k}=3+\sqrt{11+14}=8 \leq 14$.  Thus the statement holds for $P(k+1)$ is true.  Therefore the statement holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For part b), I also use induction. Let $S(n)$ be the statement: $a_{n+1} \geq a_n, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.  Then for $n=1$, we have that $S(1)$ is $a_2=3+\sqrt{11} \geq a_1=0$, which is indeed true.  Assume $S(k)$ is true for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $a_{k+1} \geq a_k$.  Then for $S(k+1)$, $a_{k+2}=3+\sqrt{11+a_{k+1}} \geq 3+\sqrt{11+a_k}=a_{k+1}$.  Thus $S(k+1)$ is true.  Thus $S(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ c) The sequence must converge since this sequence is bounded and monotonically increasing.
d) For this part do I say that $L=3+\sqrt{11+L}$, and then solve for $L$? I just want to see if I am doing this correctly.  I think that part b is incorrect because of the induction step. Any help and feedback is appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

205797,Differentiation under integral sign (Gamma function),"This might be a silly question, but I'm reading this article about differentiation under the integral sign, and I'm stumped by something that's written early on. The author is giving a derivation of the formula for $n!$ in terms of the gamma function. He shows how you can get $$\frac{n!}{t^{n+1}} = \int_0^{\infty}x^ne^{-tx}\,dx$$ by differentating under the integral sign of $\int_0^{\infty}e^{-tx}dx$. He then says that the above ""immediately implies"" the formula $$n! = \int_0^\infty x^ne^{-x}\,dx.$$ However, I can't for the life of me see how this follows. Multiplying the first equation by $t^{n+1}$ gives $n! = t^{n+1}\int_0^{\infty}x^ne^{-tx}$, so apparently $$t^{n+1}\int_0^\infty x^ne^{-tx} \, dx = \int_0^\infty x^ne^{-x} \, dx,$$ but I don't see how this is true.

205807,Finding vector subspaces,"I've got this problem: Let $H = \left \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{4} \, \left| \, x_2 - x_3 + 2x_4 = 0 \right. \right \}$ Find, if possible, $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $S, T$ vector subspaces so that $\dim(S) = \dim(T)$, $S + T^\perp = H$, $S \cap T = \left \langle (1, a, 0, -1) \right \rangle$ What I have is: Using the dimension theorem for vector spaces: $\dim(S+T^\perp) = \dim(S) + \dim(T^\perp) - \dim(S \cap T^\perp) = \dim(H)$. Since $H$ is a $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ vector subspace with one equation, $\dim(H) = 3$. So $\dim(S) = 2$, $\dim(T^\perp) = 2$ and $\dim(S \cap T^\perp)=1$. If $\dim(T^\perp) = 2$, then $\dim(T)$ must be 2 as well. So I've got $S=\left \langle s_1, s_2 \right \rangle$ and $T=\left \langle t_1, t_2 \right \rangle$ Let $s_1, s_2$ two linearly independent vectors from subspace $H$. Suppose $s_1 = (0,1,1,0), s_2 = (0,0,2,1)$. Then $S=\left \langle (0,1,1,0),(0,0,2,1) \right \rangle$. Let $t_1, t_2$ two linearly independent vectors from subspace $H$. Suppose $t_1 = (0,-2,0,1), t_2=(1,-1,1,1)$. Then $T^\perp=\left \langle (0,-2,0,1),(1,-1,1,1) \right \rangle$ Because $(T^\perp)^\perp = T \rightarrow T=\left \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{4} / -2x_2 + x_4 = x_1 - x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 0 \right \}$ S and T satisfies all the conditions the problem asks.

205871,Tensor product of monoids and arbitrary algebraic structures,"Question. Do you know a specific example which demonstrates that the tensor product of monoids (as defined below) is not associative? Let $C$ be the category of algebraic structures of a fixed type, and let us denote by $|~|$ the underlying functor $C \to \mathsf{Set}$. For $M,N \in C$ we have a functor $\mathrm{BiHom}(M,N;-) : C \to \mathsf{Set}$ which sends an object $K \in C$ to the set of bihomomorphisms $M \times N \to K$, i.e. maps $|M| \times |N| \to |K|$ which are homomorphisms in each variable when the other one is fixed. Then one can show as usual that $\mathrm{BiHom}(M,N;-)$ is representable and call the universal bihomomorphism $M \times N \to M \otimes N$ the tensor product of $M,N$. This is a straight forward generalization of the well-known case $C=\mathsf{Mod}(R)$ for a commutative ring $R$. Actually, this is a special case of a more general tensor product in concrete categories, studied in the paper ""Tensor products and bimorphisms"", Canad. Math. Bull. 19 (1976) 385-401, by B. Banaschewski and E. Nelson. Here are some examples: For $C=\mathsf{Set}$, the tensor product equals the usual cartesian product. This is also true for $C=\mathsf{Set}_*$. For $C=\mathsf{Grp}$, we get $G \otimes H \cong G^{\mathsf{ab}} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} H^{\mathsf{ab}}$, using the Eckmann-Hilton argument . (This differs from the ""tensor product of groups"" studied in the literature). The case $C=\mathsf{CMon}$ is very similar to the well-known case $C=\mathsf{Ab}$ and is spelled out here ; namely, we have internal homs and therefore a hom-tensor-adjunction. The same is true for $C=\mathsf{Mod}(\Lambda)$ for a commutative algebraic monad $\Lambda$, see here , Section 5.3. Note that the tensor product is commutative, and that it commutes with filtered colimits in each variable. However, the case $C=\mathsf{Grp}$ shows that it does not have to commute with coproducts. In particular, tensoring with some object is no left adjoint. Also, the free object on one generator is not a unit in general: Let us consider $C=\mathsf{Mon}$. Then, we have $\mathbb{N} \otimes M = M / \{ (mn)^p = m^p n^p \}_{m,n \in M, p \in \mathbb{N}}$ The usual proof of the associativity of the tensor product breaks down: There is a map $\beta : M \times (N \otimes K) \to (M \otimes N) \otimes K$ mapping $(m, n \otimes k) \mapsto (m \otimes n) \otimes k$, which is a homomorphism in the second variable. But what about the first variable? The equation $\beta(mm',t) = \beta(m,t) \beta(m',t)$ is clear if $t \in N \otimes K$ is a pure tensor. But for $t=(n \otimes k) (n' \otimes k')$ we end up with the unlikely equation $((m \otimes n) \otimes k) ((m' \otimes n) \otimes k) ((m \otimes n') \otimes k') ((m' \otimes n') \otimes k')$

205875,Convex hull of an open set...,"Let $K$ be a compact convex subset of locally convex topological vector space $E$.
Let $U$ be an open subset of $K$. Is $conv(U)$ (the convex hull of $U$) an open subset of $K$ ? You see, it is well know that if $U$ is an open subset of $E$, then $conv(U)$ is an open subset of E. the argument for this is based on the fact that the addition is an open map for $E \times E$ to $E$, hence if you take $(a_1,...,a_n)$ such that $\sum a_i =1$, then the set of $\sum a_i u_i$ for $u_i \in U$ is an open set, and hence $conv(U)$ is an union of open set. But when we restrict ourselves to $K$ the former argument no longer hold : for exemple if $U = K$, $n=2$ and $a_1=a_2= \frac{1}{2}$, then the set of $\sum a_i u_i$ is the set of non-extremal point of $K$, which may be non open even in a finite dimensional case... but still i can't find any counterexample to my question. Note : Using local convexity we can show that it is enough to proove that if $U$ and $V$ are two open convex subset of $K$ then the set of $a u +(1-a)v$ with a in $[0,1]$ is open in $K$.

(Serre's criterion) A scheme is normal if and only if it is nonsingular in codimension 0 and codimension 1 and every stalk at a generic point of an irreducible closed subset with dimension $\ge 2$ has depth at least 2. Every rational function on a normal scheme with no poles of codimension 1 is regular. (Zariski connectedness): If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a proper birational map of noetherian integral schemes and $Y$ is normal, then every fiber is connected. Normal schemes over $C$ are topologically unibranched. But the proofs I've seen are fairly ad-hoc, and I was wondering if there's some geometric perspective that would clarify these results. The only result here thats an ""iff"" is Serre's criterion, but I don't understand depth geometrically so I'm not sure how to interpret it. Is there some nice geometric perspective on normality?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

206131,Help explaining the sign of a permutation,"I have a permutation that has been expressed in disjoint cycles (this isn't my actual question, this is an example done in lectures which I'm trying to understand): (a b c)(d e f g h i) Now the procedure taught to calculate the sign of the permutation is to multiply the signs of the disjoint cycles, but in the example it is written: $ (-1)^2 \cdot (-1)^5 = -1 $ Why is it being raised to the powers of 2 and 5? Should it not be 3 and 6 because that is the length of the cycles? Because when I try my question, I calculate the inversions of the permutation and using that gives me the sign to be negative, but the disjoint cycle has 8 ""elements"" so $ (-1)^8 = 1 $, which is not negative. So does that mean you always do $(-1)^{\mathrm{(Length\, \, of\, \, cycle\, \, - 1)}} $ and then multiply like this?","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'cyclic-groups']"
206145,Implicit Function Theorem: a counter-example,"The following theorem is stated in Spivak's ""Calculus on Manifolds"" as a follow-up on the Implicit Function Theorem: Theorem 2.13: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^p$ be continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$, where $p \le n$. if $f(a) = 0$ and the $p \times n$ matrix $(D_jf_i(a))$ has rank $p$, then there is an open set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing $a$ and a differentiable function $h: A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with differentiable inverse such that $$f \circ h (x^1, \dots, x^n) = (x^{n-p+1}, \dots, x^n).$$ I don't see how this can be true. For a simple counter-example, let $f(x) = \sin(x)$ with $n=p=1$. Since $f'(2\pi)=1$, the theorem should hold at $a = 2\pi$, and since $a \in A$ we get for $x = a = 2\pi$: $$\sin(h(a)) = a = 2\pi,$$ which cannot be true for any $h$.

If $ a^3 b = ba^3 $ and if a has order 7, show that $ ab = ba $ . The sketch of a proof he wrote out went like this (this is what I have in my notes) Does $ (a^3)^2 = a^6 $ commute with $ b $ ? Well, $ a^6 = a^{-1} $ because $ a^7 = e $ So $ a^{-1}b = b a^{-1} $ so $ b = aba^{-1} $ so $ ba = ab $ I don't completely follow. It seems like this should be basic, but it isn't for me. By writing out $ (a^3)^2 $ it seem to imply that he could substitute $ (a^3)^2 $ for $ a^3 $ and put it into the original equation. That doesn't make sense to me because I figured $ a^3 $ is a distinct element, not a variable. I am not sure how he is synthesizing the premises with $ a^6 = a^{-1} $ to find $ a^{-1}b = b a^{-1} $ .

Here it is $\frac{1}{5}\left(60 + 20\sum_{n=0}^{29} f(n)\right) = 143972$. We certainly cannot do this by brute force: For an $m\times n$ matrix the number of possibilities are: $(n!)^m$ which combinatorially explodes. Here, two of the columns given are zeros so we have $\left(\frac{n!}{2}\right)^m$ unique ways to permute the values of each row - which is not much better. Fortunately, this matrix has a well-defined pattern to it, and I am wondering: can this pattern can be exploited to derive solutions more easily? EDIT: I have made a recursive depth-first search to find solutions. On each iteration, it attempts to construct a vector that sums to the desired result (in this case 143972) by choosing each entry in the vector from a different row in the matrix. Once one such vector has been created, it removes the chosen entries from the matrix thereby changing it from an $m\times n$ matrix to an $m \times n-1$ one. This repeats until either no solution can be found, or a the matrix becomes empty. In the worst case, it runs on the order of $n^m$ for an $m\times n$ matrix (but it turns out that finding one solution is fast because my matrix has many, many solutions apparently).

206377,1-1 functions and Schroder-Bernstein Theorem,"Using Schroder-Bernsten Theorem. Assume there exists a 1-1 function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and another 1-1 function $g:Y \rightarrow X$. If we define $f^{(-1)}(y)=x$, then $f^{(-1)}$ is a 1-1 function from $f(X)$ onto $X$. Follow the steps to show that there exists a 1-1, onto function $h:X \rightarrow Y$. I'm asking about part (a) of the problem: Let $x$ be in $X$ be arbitrary. Let the chain $Cx$ be the set consisting of all elements of the form $$
....,\, f^{(-1)}(g^{(-1)}(x)),\, g^{(-1)}(x),\,x,\,f(x), g(f(x)),\,f(g(f(x))),\,....
$$ Explain why the (distinct) number of elements to the left of $x$ in the above chain may be zero, finite, or infinite. Since the functions are 1-1, say $x$ map to a distinct $y$ in $Y$. 
So evaluating the chain (the $x$ in bold separates the left and right sides of the chain), you get:
$$
                ....x,\, y,\, \textbf{x},\, y,\, x,\, y,\, ...
$$
The left side of the chain is obviously composed of the $x$ and $y$ predefined above. I don't really understand what the question means. My interpretation is that the left side of the chain is finite because the functions, being 1-1, map a distinct $x$ to a distinct $y$, so those are finitely many elements (2 in this case). But I'm not sure if I'm right. Any input?

So far, I have managed to use Urysohn to show that the closed maximal connected component decomposition of $X$ (as opposed to the path component decomposition) is one where every component is a 1 point set. This question arose from trying to solve the question that every C* algebra with all normal elements having finite spectra are finite dimensional.  A more direct solution to this general question would also suffice, because actually implies the special case I've reduced it to.  By taking a unitization, and then a MASA in the unitization, one gets to the case I've gotten to. Also, a topological question that is in the same setup but handles a related operator algebras question is this: if a net $u_i$ and $u$ in $X$ has the property that for all continuous $f \in C(X)$ one has that $f(u_i)$ converges to $f(u)$ then must $u_i$ converge to $u$ in topology?

The $f_i$ are all smooth and homogeneous of the same ($p\neq-1)$) degree, i.e. $f_i(t\vec x)=t^pf_i(\vec x)$. This latter fact gives us that $\large\Sigma_{j=1}^nx_j{\partial f_i\over \partial x_j}(\vec x)=pf_i(\vec x)$. I don't know whether it's all the summations involved or what, but I can't seem to get this to work out.  It so happens that I always have the j's and i's mixed in the wrong way...This might indicate that the question isn't true as stated...or more likely that I'm failing at some fairly basic bookkeeping. In the end I keep ending up with $\large dg={1\over{p+1}}\Sigma^n_{j=1}\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i{\partial f_i\over \partial x_j}dx_j+f_i$, which won't really allow me to use any of the nice identities I've earned.","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms', 'exterior-algebra']"

206660,Simultaneous diagonalization of quadratic forms,"I would like to collect references (or direct quotations) about as many ""simultaneous diagonalization"" results in linear algebra as possible. Let $V$ be an $n$ -dimentional ( $n$ finite) vector space over the field $\mathbb{K}$ .
Note that if the characteristic of $\mathbb{K}$ is $\neq$ from $2$ then speaking of quadratic forms is essentially the same as speaking of bilinear forms. Theorem 1. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of diagonalizable operators on $V$ . Then $\mathcal{S}$ is simultaneously diagonalizable if and only if it commutes (i.e. $AB=BA\;\;\; \forall A,B\in\mathcal{S}$ ). Theorem 2. Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ . Let $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ be a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form and $b$ any symmetric bilinear form on $V$ . Write $b(\cdot,\cdot)=\langle A\cdot|\cdot\rangle$ for a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -symmetric operator $A$ . Suppose $A$ is diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots , \lambda_n$ . Then there is a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -orthonormal basis $\mathcal{B}$ in which the matrix of $b$ is diagonal with diagonal entries $\lambda_1,\dots , \lambda_n$ . Proof 2. Let $\mathcal{B}=\{ v_1,\dots , v_n \}$ a basis of eigenvectors for $A$ , with distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \dots , \lambda_n$ . Then $\lambda_l\cdot\langle v_l|v_k \rangle=\langle \lambda_l\cdot v_l|v_k \rangle=\langle A(v_l) |v_k \rangle=\langle v_l |A^{T}(v_k) \rangle=\langle v_l| A(v_k)\rangle=\lambda_k\cdot\langle v_l|v_k \rangle$ , hence $(\lambda_l-\lambda_k)\cdot\langle v_l|v_k \rangle=0$ for all $l,k$ . Then eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Furthermore, $\langle v_i|v_i \rangle\neq 0$ for all $i$ or $v_i$ would be orthogonal to $\mathcal{B}$ for some $i$ . Now let $\xi_i$ be a square root of $\lambda_i$ in $\mathbb{C}$ , and set $w_i:=\frac{1}{\xi_i}\cdot v_i$ . Then $\{ w_1,\dots , w_n \}$ is the basis we are seeking. Theorem 3. Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ . Let $q$ be an indefinite quadratic form and $q'$ any quadratic form on $V$ . Suppose that, for every $v\in V$ , $q(v)=0$ implies $q'(v)=0$ . Then there is $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $q'=\alpha \cdot q$ . Furthermore, if $\alpha\neq 0$ , also $q'$ is indefinite and, for all $v \in V$ , $q(v)=0$ if and only if $q'(v)=0$ . Note that in particular, by Sylvester's theorem, $q$ and $q'$ are simultaneously diagonalizable. Proof 3. See Elton, Indefinite quadratic forms and the invariance of the interval in Special Relativity . Theorem 4. Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ . Let $q$ and $q'$ be two semidefinite quadratic forms on $V$ . Suppose that for all $v\in V$ $q(v)=0$ implies $q'(v)=0$ . Then $q$ and $q'$ are simultaneosly diagonalizable. Proof 4. See Elton, Indefinite quadratic forms and the invariance of the interval in Special Relativity . Theorem 5. Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ . Let $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ be a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form and $b$ any symmetric bilinear form on $V$ . Then there is a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -orthonormal basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $V$ in which the matrix of $b$ is diagonal. Proof 5. Write $b(\cdot,\cdot)=\langle A\cdot|\cdot\rangle$ for a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -symmetric operator $A$ . Then by the Spectral Theorem for real symmetric operators there is a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -orthogonal basis $\mathcal{B}=\{ e_1, \dots, e_n \}$ in which the matrix of $A$ is diagonal with diagonal entries $\lambda_1,\dots , \lambda_n$ . Then $b(e_i,e_j)=\langle Ae_i|e_j \rangle=\lambda_i\cdot\langle e_i|e_j \rangle=\lambda_i\cdot\delta_{ij}$ ( $\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker's symbol), hence $\mathcal{B}$ diagonalizes $b$ . Theorem 6. Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ . Let $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ be a Hermitian (i.e. a sesquilinear positive definite) form and $b$ any sesquilinear form on $V$ . Then there is a $\langle\;|\;\rangle$ -orthonormal basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $V$ in which the matrix of $b$ is diagonal. Proof 6. As in Theorem 5. but using the Spectral Theorem for Hermitian operators instead. Edit: I have collected two more theorems. Theorem 7. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be of characteristic $\neq 2$ . Let $\langle\; |\; \rangle_1$ , $\langle\; |\; \rangle_2$ be two non degenerate symmetric bilinear forms on $V$ . Let $\Phi_i:V\to V^*, v\mapsto \langle v | \;\rangle_i$ , $i=1,2$ . Then $\langle\; | \;\rangle_1$ and $\langle\; | \;\rangle_2$ are simultaneously diagonalizable if and only if $\Phi_2^{-1}\circ\Phi_1\in \mathrm{Aut}(V)$ is diagonalizable as an operator. Proof 7. See M.J.Wonenburger, Simultaneous Diagonalization of Symmetric Bilinear Forms . Remark: Note that $\Phi_2^{-1}\circ\Phi_1$ is symmetric w.r.t. $\langle\; | \;\rangle_2$ , and $\Phi_1^{-1}\circ\Phi_2$ is symmetric w.r.t. $\langle\; | \;\rangle_1$ . So, in case $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ , we recover part of Theorem 5. Theorem 8. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a real closed field . Let $f_1, f_2$ be two quadratic forms on $V$ such that there is no $v\neq 0$ in $V$ for which $f_1(v)=f_2(v)=0$ . Suppose $n=\dim V>2$ , then $f_1$ and $f_2$ are simultaneously diagonalizable. Proof 8. See M.J.Wonenburger, Simultaneous Diagonalization of Symmetric Bilinear Forms . Q1. I would like to know other theorems like the above ones (not deriving from them in a tautological way). Q2. Is there a more general theorem on the topic that treats all fields at once and reduces to (a subset of) the above theorems by specialization? Q3.

Solution Attempt Let $n\in N$ and let $B_0(R^n)$ denote the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $R^n$. Let $\lambda^n:B_0(R^n)\rightarrow[0,R^+]$ denote the usual $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

$\lambda^{n} \ll \mu_1^{n} \ll \lambda^{n}$ and 
$\lambda^{n} \ll \mu_2^{n} \ll \lambda^{n}$ where $\ll$ stands for absolute continuity of measures;
Hence we have absolute continuity relations $\mu_1^{n} \ll \lambda^{n}$ and $\lambda^{n} \ll \mu_2^{n}$. Also since $\lambda^{n} \ll \mu_1^{n} \ll \lambda^{n}$
we can use the Radon-Nikodym property $\dfrac {d\lambda } {d\mu_1}=\left( \dfrac {d{\mu_1}} {d\lambda }\right) ^{-1}$ Since both Lebesgue and Gaussian measures are $\sigma$-finite and based on the above relations we should be apply the Radon-Nikodym Chain Rule here.

206798,Pulling cards from a deck without replacement to reach a goal: average draws needed?,"I have the following probability problem that I think must be quite common. The problem is as follows: Let's say I have a goal of drawing 3 jacks from a regular deck of 52 cards (in which there are 4 jacks). I conduct many experiments. In each experiment, I shuffle the deck and pull cards one-by-one and discard the card without replacement. When I reach my goal of having pulled 3
  jacks, I write down the number of cards I had needed to pull and stop the experiment . e.g. in the first experiment I might have hit the 3rd jack on the 40th card, so I write down '40'. I repeat this infinite times, and then average the number of cards pulled to reach 3 jacks. On average, how many cards did I need to pull before reaching 3 jacks? Note that I am stopping after pulling the third jack, so my last draw must be a successful jack draw. I think I can solve this problem using hypergeometric distributions, but the solution is ugly and complicated (it gives 31.8 draws on average are needed, which matches Monte Carlo simulations a colleague ran for me). I think I've stumbled upon a much simpler formula: average draws needed =  (n) * (x+1)/(y+1) where n is the number of jacks I want (3), x is the number of cards in the deck (52), and y is the number of jacks in the deck (4). Other than by blind luck of simple observation that I got playing around with numbers, I have no idea how to derive the above formula. Has anyone seen this problem and know how this simple formula might be derived? I should also note that the simple formula has been tested for many n, x, and y values and matches both the complicated formula and several simulations run for this problem.

Also (and as a result), $\forall n \geq 3$ $$ \frac{p_{n}}{ln(p_{n})} - \sqrt{p_{n}} > 0$$
Or $$ \frac{\pi (p_{n})}{p_{n}/ln(p_{n})} < \frac{\pi (p_{n})}{\sqrt{p_{n}}}$$ According to PNT $$\displaystyle\smash{\lim_{n \to \infty }}\frac{\pi (p_{n})}{p_{n}/ln(p_{n})}=1$$

Interestingly, Andrica's conjecture is true iff function $f_{4}(x)=\pi (x) - \sqrt{x}$ is strictly ascending ($x < y \Rightarrow f(x) < f(y)$) for prime arguments.

Or $$\sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_{n}} < \pi (p_{n+1}) - \pi (p_{n}) =1$$ And vice-versa, if $$\sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_{n}} < 1$$
Then $$-\sqrt{p_{n}} < -\sqrt{p_{n+1}} + 1$$
Or $$\pi (p_{n})-\sqrt{p_{n}} < \pi (p_{n}) + 1 -\sqrt{p_{n+1}} = \pi (p_{n+1}) -\sqrt{p_{n+1}}$$ So, if Andrica's conjecture is true then $\forall n \geq 3$ $$\pi (p_{n})-\sqrt{p_{n}} > 0$$
