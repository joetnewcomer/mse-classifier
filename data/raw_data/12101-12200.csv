  adjacent sides are in ratio 1:3. Calculate the angles of the other

94331,Two players alternately flip a coin; what is the probability of winning by getting a head?,"Two players, $A$ and $B$, alternately and independently flip a coin and the first player to get a head wins. Assume player $A$ flips first.  If the coin is fair, what is the probability that $A$ wins? So $A$ only flips on odd tosses. So the probability of winning would be $$ P =\frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} \frac{1}{2} + \cdots+ \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{2n} \frac{1}{2}$$ Is that right? It seems that if $A$ only flips on odd tosses, this shouldn't matter. Either $A$ can win on his first toss, his second toss, ...., or his $n^{th}$ toss. So the third flip of the coin is actually $A$'s second toss. So shouldn't it be $$P = \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{3} + \cdots$$",['probability']

Let $s$ be a permutation in the symmetric group of degree $n$, and let $t$ be a transposition $(i,j)$ in the same group. If $n$ is $1$ or infinite, we are done. Otherwise, ....[details of the proof omitted.] (We use the right-to-left convention to multiply permutations.) Okay, we have shown that the number of orbits of $s$ and $ts$ differ by 1. This part, I understand. But I don't understand how to infer the theorem from here. I would be very grateful if someone can help me clear my blind spot. Thank you so much! Added by Dylan. Here is Fraleigh's explanation (please don't sue me): We have shown that the number of orbits of $\tau \sigma$ differs from the number of orbits of $\sigma$ by $1$. The identity permutation $\iota$ has $n$ orbits, because each element is the only member of its orbit. Now the number of orbits of a given permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ differs from $n$ by either an even or odd number, but not both. Thus it is impossible to write 
  $$

If you just expand $(a+1)(b+1)=(a+1)b+a+1=ab+b+a+1$ $(a+1)(b+1)=a(b+1)+b+1=ab+a+b+1$. Hence, $ab+a+b+1=ab+b+a+1$, then cancel ab and 1. Then, you get it's commutative for free. Why do we then assume it? Also, is it even stronger. If we drop the condition that 1 is in R, then can we still deduce a+b=b+a?

94356,Determining $|z-1|$ when $z=\cos\theta +i\sin\theta$ and $\theta$ is acute,"As the question indicates we are supposed to find the modulus of z-1. When trying to solve the problem I drew a diagram which you can see below: The book I am working in solved a similar problem when showing examples, however the question was for $|z+1|$. There they proved that the modulus is given by $2\cos {\theta \over 2}$. In the case of $z-1$ though the shape is not a rhombus (which it is when you construct the diagram for $|z+1|$). As a result the diagonals are not perpendicular. The book however states that $|z-1|=2\sin {\theta \over 2}$ Proof that $|z+1|=2\cos {\theta \over 2}$ Using the diagram above one can see that $|z+1|=2\cos {\theta \over 2}$ as the length from the origin to the intersection of the diagonals is given by $\cos {\theta \over 2}$. Now, to get the length of the whole diagonal just multiply that by 2.

94358,Need help understanding Axiom of Extensionality,"I'm attempting to learn Set Theory and I'm currently working through Halmos' Naive Set Theory .  I will say that I completely understand the essence of the Axiom of Extensionality.  However, where I'm stumbling is grasping its formalization in set-builder notation.  So, looking at:
$$\forall x\forall y \, \left(x=y \leftrightarrow \forall z \, \left(z\in x \leftrightarrow z\in y\right)\right)$$ The part I do not follow is the $\left(z\in x\leftrightarrow z\in y\right)$ So, in my head, if I imagine that I have a set $x$ that is $\{ “a”, “b”, “c”\}$ and I have a set $y$ that is $\{“a”, “b”, “c”, “d” \}$, I intuitively understand that by the Axiom of Extension, sets $x$ and $y$ are not equal.  However, I don't follow how the formal statement would yield this.  So for example, suppose we have a set $z$ that is $\{ “a”, “b”, “c”\}$. So, in my mind - here's what I do to mentally work through the formal statement of the axiom.  First, I'll ask myself: Is $z$ in $y$?  Well, since $y$ is $a, b, c, d$ and $z$ is $a, b, c$ - so it would certainly seem that $z$ is in fact in $y$.  So then I'll ask myself: Is $z$ in $x$?  Well, $x$ is $a, b, c$ and $z$ is $a, b, c$ - so it would certainly seem that $z$ is also in fact in $x$!  Therefore, the expression $\left(z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y\right)$ should evaluate to True and therefore $x = y$ (which of course I know is wrong). So, hopefully you can see why I am stuck on this.  I assume the root of my misunderstanding is a flaw in how I'm interpreting the formal statement; specifically the iff biconditional connective; but I'm just not seeing how/why I am. Any help in providing clarity on where / how I'm stumbling on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for you time.","['axioms', 'elementary-set-theory']"

If $f(n)$ is $\operatorname{Fibonacci}(n)$ (to make it short), then it must be true that $f(3n) = 4f(3n - 3) + f(3n - 6)$. I have tried the obvious expansion: $f(3n) = f(3n - 1) + f(3n - 2) = f(3n - 3) + 2f(3n - 2) = 3f(3n - 3) + 2f(3n - 4)$

And $\tan(1^\circ)$ is .....,"In the book 101 problems in Trigonometry , Prof. Titu Andreescu and Prof. Feng asks for the proof the fact that $\cos 1^\circ$ is irrational and he proves it. The proof proceeds by contradiction and using the strong induction principle. (Problem on Pg:84, 70 in typeset; solution on Pg:126, 111 in Typeset). However, for Completeness, I'll append it here: Proof of irrationality of $\cos (1^\circ)$ Assume for the sake of contradiction, that $\cos(1^\circ)$ is rational. Since, $$\cos(2^\circ)=2\cos^2(1^\circ)-1$$ we have that, $\cos(2^\circ)$ is also rational. Note that, we also have $$\cos(n^\circ +1 ^\circ)+\cos(n^\circ -1 ^\circ)=2\cos(1^\circ)\cdot 
\cos(n^\circ)$$ By Strong induction principle, this shows that $\cos(n^\circ)$ is rational for all integers $n \geq 1$. But, this is clearly false, as for instance, $\cos(30^\circ)=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is irrational, reaching a contradiction. But, as my title suggests, $\sin(1^\circ)$ is irrational, (look at the following image for its value!)

94486,Interpretations of the first cohomology group,"I've been revisiting group cohomology, and I realized that there is something I never quite understood. Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $A$ be a $G$-module (i.e. $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-module). Then the second cohomology $H^2(G,A)$ classifies group extensions $1\rightarrow A\rightarrow E\rightarrow G\rightarrow 1$ such that the action of $G$ on $A$ by left conjugation jibes with the given action of $G$ on $A$. The interpretation of the first cohomology group, however, I still find somewhat elusive. On the one hand, there is the following interpretation: $H^1(G,A)$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Aut} ( 1\rightarrow A\rightarrow E\rightarrow G\rightarrow 1) / \sim$ (where $\sim$ is conjugation by an element of $A$, and where $\operatorname{Aut}$ is taken in the category of group extensions of $G$ by $A$) by $\langle \rangle \mapsto (e \mapsto \langle f(e)\rangle e)$, where $f$ is the map $E\rightarrow G$, and where $\langle \rangle$ is a $1$-cocycle. This is indeed an isomorphism. However, there is another interpretation! Some places say that there is a bijection between $H^1(G,A)$ and sections of $f:E\rightarrow G$ up to conjugation by an element of $A$! Here the problem is that I can't quite decipher if this should mean set-theoretic sections or group-theoretic sections. Here's how I'm thinking about this: you can let $\operatorname{Aut}(E)/\sim$ act on the set of set-theoretic sections of $f$ by $\phi$ acts on $\lambda$ taking it to the section $\phi\circ \lambda$. It seems like this action is free. Furthermore, it seems like it is transitive. Indeed, if you want to take $\lambda$ to $\lambda'$ you can use the automorphism $e\mapsto \lambda'(f(e))\lambda^{-1}(f(e))e$ ($e\mapsto \lambda'(f(e))\lambda^{-1}(f(e))$ is a $1$-cocycle). So it seems like this gives a (non-canonical) bijection between $H^1(G,A)$ and the set-theoretic sections. But something is wrong -- this action takes the group-theoretic sections to group-theoretic sections! So it can't act freely and transitively on the set of set-theoretic sections... I'm not quite sure what the resolution of this is since most sources don't distinguish between group-theoretic sections and set-theoretic sections. Also, if you can inform me a way to think about this that relates these two interpretations with the interpretation that the first cohomology classifies torsors, I would be very happy indeed!","['group-cohomology', 'group-theory']"
94491,A proof that powers of two cannot be expressed as the sum of multiple consecutive positive integers that uses binary representations?,"In this earlier question , the OP asks for a proof of the statement Every natural number not of the form $2^k$ for some natural number k can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

It would seem that since powers of two and addition are involved that there would be some proof that powers of two cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers that works by exploring properties of addition of binary numbers.  That is, we could prove this result by showing that binary addition of multiple consecutive integers, as an algorithm, is incapable of producing a power of two.

If yes, then once my lecturer ask me to proof that rational numbers are countable, so in this case if I represent  rational numbers  by following  function from set of positive numbers:
$$f(n)=\frac{n+1}{n}$$

94590,Matrix Multiplication for n-dimensional arrays,"Background Within the context of my research, I have been working with a vector-based model that treats entities of a function-like language as vectors: Some of these entities are ""objects"", represented as simple vectors in an object space $A$. Others act as linear maps $f : A \to B$  over objects, and are vectors in some space $B \otimes A$. Such vectors can be represented as $\dim(B)$ by $\dim(A)$ matrices, such that for any vector $\mathbf{v} \in A$ and any vector $\mathbf{f} \in B \otimes A$ represented as a matrix $M_{\mathbf{f}}$, the application of the function that $\mathbf{f}$ encodes to the object $\mathbf{v}$ encodes is simply the matrix multiplication $M_{\mathbf{f}} \times \mathbf{v}$. Trivially, the result of this computation is a vector in $B$, hence fitting the interpretation that $\mathbf{f}$ encodes a function $f: A \to B$. Problem We want this sort of representation to scale with the arity of the function. For example, functions of type $g: A \times B \to C$ are represented by vectors in $C \otimes B \otimes A$. Within the formalism we work with, there is a way of effectively computing the equivalent of the operation performed above to apply $f$ to some object $v \in A$. However, it would be convenient (and more elegant) if there were some way of representing such an application with matrix-like operations. This is to say, either: To allow the curried application of $\mathbf{g} \in C \otimes B \otimes A$ to some $\mathbf{v} \in A$, thereby obtaining vector $\mathbf{h} \in C \otimes B$, which would effectively be a $\dim(C)$ by $\dim(B)$ matrix $M_\mathbf{h}$ representing a function $h: B \to C$. To allow the application of $\mathbf{g} \in C \otimes B \otimes A$ to some $\mathbf{v \otimes w} \in A \otimes B$ (representable as a $\dim(A)$ by $\dim(B)$ matrix $M_{\mathbf{v \otimes w}}$), thereby obtaining a result vector $\mathbf{r} \in C$. Ideally, there exists some notion of representing rank $n$ tensors as $n$ dimensional matrices (i.e. seeing vectors as 1-dimensional matrices, regular matrices as 2-dimensional matrices, etc) which would allow us to represent the ternary function $g$ described above as some 3-dimensional array $M_{\mathbf{g}}$ such that: $M_{\mathbf{g}}$ can be applied to a vector $\mathbf{v} \in A$ to obtain $M_{\mathbf{g}} \times \mathbf{v} = M_{\mathbf{h}}$, a 2-dimensional matrix which in turn can be applied to $\mathbf{w} \in B$ so that $M_{\mathbf{h}} \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{r}$ (curried function application). $M_{\mathbf{g}}$ can be applied directly to the matrix representation of $\mathbf{v \otimes w} \in A \otimes B$ to obtain the result vector $M_{\mathbf{g}} \times M_{\mathbf{v \otimes w}} = \mathbf{r}$ (regular function application). Questions Is this concept of treating rank $n$ tensors as $n$-dimensional matrices (or, if this term is somehow inappropriate, $n$-dimensional arrays) discussed anywhere in the mathematics literature? I have looked around, but have been unable to find any canonical definition. Likewise, is there anything in the mathematics literature about doing matrix multiplication with $n$-dimensional arrays, as described above? In practice, the notion of $n$-dimensional matrices is present in several programming languages (e.g. in Matlab , and in Numpy/SciPy for Python ), where they can be multiplied with $k$-dimensional matrices as well as lower dimension matrices, with the same sort of constraints as normal matrix multiplication (namely that the ""length"" of the ""last"" dimension of a matrix must match that of the ""first"" dimension of the matrix it is applied to, just like an $m \times n$ matrix can only be multiplied with a $n \times l$ matrix). These sort of data structures fit the bill, but I cannot find anything in the literature that describes such structures formally. I would appreciate your help if you know of any. I appreciate the time you took to look over this rather long problem specification. I hope I was clear in explaining what I'm looking for, and look forward to reading your answers.

94620,What do modern-day analysts actually do?,"In an abstract algebra class, one learns about groups, rings, and fields, and (perhaps naively) conceives of a modern-day algebraist as someone who studies these sorts of structures.  One learns about the classification of finite simple groups , and gains some slight sense of what a group theorist might wonder about. In a topology class, one learns about topological spaces, and conceives of an algebraic topologist as someone who studies topological spaces, their algebraic invariants, and wonders about ways of classifying such spaces.  Similarly, a differential geometer might be described as someone who studies manifolds and their invariants, and an algebraic geometer as someone who studies varieties and schemes and their invariants. Now, obviously these sorts of one-sentence descriptions are rather simplistic, especially since many (most?) mathematicians work at the interface of a variety of different areas. That being said, I feel that I have absolutely no conception of what contemporary analysts actually do.  My sense is that contemporary analysis does not , for example, resemble the material found in (say) Folland's text . To be slightly more concrete, my question boils down to these: What areas of analysis are at the center of active research? What sort of questions are analysts concerned with?  What are some major themes that each subject is concerned with?  What are the big-picture goals of each subject? My sense is that current areas of research include: Harmonic analysis (and Fourier analysis ) Operator theory Partial differential equations (PDE) Several complex variables (SCV) Geometric measure theory (GMT) My sense is that analysts care about things like regularity, growth, and oscillations, and might be concerned with: Approximation problems Interpolation problems Optimization problems Boundary-value problems However, all of this is really the extent of my understanding. Note on motivation: Just to be clear, I am someone who really likes analysis.  Part of my motivation for asking (other than curiosity) is that I seem to meet very few American undergraduates or first-year graduate students who are interested in pursuing analysis, and sometimes wonder if this is because few of us seem to have any idea what analysts actually do.

94715,Working with Morphisms in Local Coordinates,"In light of the holiday, I would like to air a grievance. I have no good way to recoordinatize a morphism of varieties as I move between coordinate neighborhoods. Let me explain what I mean with an example.

So there is addition morphism $\mu:E\times E \rightarrow E$ and an inverse morphism $-:E \rightarrow E.$ A calulation shows, $-\mu$ is given by $$X(-\mu) = \frac{(z_1 -z_0)^2 - (x_1 -x_0)(x_1z_0 - x_0z_1)}{(x_1 -x_0)^2 + (x_1 - x_0)(z_1 - z_0)} - x_0 - x_1$$ $$Z(-\mu) = \frac{z_1 - z_0}{x_1 -x_0}\left(\frac{(z_1 -z_0)^2 - (x_1 -x_0)(x_1z_0 - x_0z_1)}{(x_1 -x_0)^2 + (x_1 - x_0)(z_1 - z_0)} - x_0 - x_1\right) + \frac{x_1z_0 - x_0z_1}{x_1 -x_0} $$ on $E_Y \times E_Y$ outside of the locus $(x_1 -x_0)^2 + (x_1 - x_0)(z_1 - z_0) = 0.$ I would like to express the morphism $-\mu$ in terms of regular functions on some open neighborhood of $O \times O,$ but my current method of obtaining such an expression is ""to move symbols around"" in my expression for $-\mu$ using the relation of the curve, $(1),$ until I obtain a regular expression at $(0,0) \times (0,0).$ This is often a huge waste of time and becomes nearly impossible as the equations defining the variety become more complicated.

If given an arbitrary solvable puzzle, can the minimum number of moves in the solution be computed? If not exactly, hopefully a tight asymptotic bound? If it cannot be computed easily for an individual puzzle, what about a global upper bound? I cannot get anything better than $\lfloor{\frac{m^2}{2}}\rfloor n + \lfloor{\frac{n^2}{2}}\rfloor m - m - n + 2$, which is obtained from considering the total vertical and horizontal distance over all squares excluding the special square, which each move can decrease by at most 1. The worst configuration seems to be when the whole grid is rotated 180-degrees about the centre. This bound is clearly tight for $(m,n)=(2,2)$ but nothing else.

Let's first have a look at the case $n = 2$. i) Suppose we have a non-trivial homomorphism $\phi : G \to \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z $, where $G$ is a group. Then $H = \mathrm{ker}\phi$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $\phi$ is non-trivial, $G/H \cong \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z$ and we have that $H$ is a normal subgroup of index $2$ in $G$. So every non-trivial homomorphism $\phi$ gives rise to an index $2$ subgroup $\mathrm{ker}\phi$. ii) Suppose $H$ is a subgroup of index $2$ in $G$. Then $H$ is necessarily normal and not equal to $G$. It seems natural to define $\phi : G \to \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z$ by $\phi(H) = 0$, $\phi(G \backslash H) = 1$. This is necessarily a homomorphism, since the product of two elements in $G \backslash H$ must be in $H$ (using normality of $H$). So every index $2$ subgroup gives rise to a non-trivial homomorphism, and the required correspondence is established. Let's see what happens when we try to generalise this method for higher $n$. If $n = 3$, any non-trivial homomorphism $\phi : G \to \mathbb Z / 3 \mathbb Z$ must be surjective, and so the argument used in i) still works; every non-trivial homomorphism $\phi$ gives rise to an index $3$ subgroup $\mathrm{ker}\phi$. I then come across two problems: I can't seem to generalise i) for $n$ higher than $3$, since I can't guarantee surjectivity. EDIT: I can guarantee surjectivity if $n$ is prime, though (since non-triviality implies the existence of a $g \in G$ with $\phi(g) = a \neq 0$, and $n$ prime implies the existence of a multiplicative inverse of $a \ (\mathrm{mod } \ n )$). I can't even generalise my argument in ii) to the case when $n = 3 $, since normality was key here. I suppose what I'd like to know is: A) Is there a nice generalisation of the $n=2$ result? Does it use the same method and, if so, why haven't I managed to get it to work? B) Is there some other approach to this problem / explanation of why no such approach exists? Perhaps it might be helpful to decompose $\mathbb Z / n \mathbb Z$ according to the prime factorisation of $n$? C) Is there anything else relevant to the problem that I haven't thought about?

Also, are there other good references for learning this topic? Thanks.",['differential-geometry']
94959,"Pointwise, uniformly and absolute convergence of Fourier series","I'd really love your help with this one:
I got this Fourier series for $f(x)=x$ in $[-\pi,\pi]$: $$\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{2(-1)^{n+1}\sin(nx)}{n}$$ and I need to check if it's (i) pointwise converges,(ii) uniformly converges and if (iii) $$\sum_{1}^{\infty}\left|\frac{2(-1)^{n+1}\sin(nx)}{n}\right|$$ converges.. I tried to do it, and I have couple of specific questions that interrupt me. (i) Can I claim that the series is pointwise due to Leibniz test? since $\frac{\sin(nx)}{n} \to 0$? I was told that I need to use Lipschitz continuity here. How do I use it? (ii) I was told that this series is not uniformly converges since $f(x)$ is not continuous in this part. How come ? Is it because we always see those functions who we compute their Fourier series as periodic functions with period of $[0,2\pi]$ so in our case the function in $0$ is not continues? (iii) How come I can't use Dirichlet test for series and claim that the $$\sum_{1}^{\infty}\left|\frac{2(-1)^{n+1}\sin(nx)}n\right|$$ does converges? The test requires a multiple of a series that monotonic converges to $0$ and $\sum_{1}^{N}|\sin(nx)|<M$? Is it wrong? How can you prove that this series does not converge?

94994,"""The Galois group of $\pi$ is $\mathbb{Z}$""","Last year, in a talk of Michel Waldschmidt's, I remember hearing a statement along the lines of the title of this question: The Galois group of $\pi$ is $\mathbb{Z}$. In what sense/framework is this true? What was meant exactly - and can this notion be made precise? I imagine that this would draw on the fact that the $\sin x$ is an 'infinite polynomial' over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose roots are the integer multiples of $\pi$. However, if this is the case, then how can we possibly view this function as a sort of generalized 'minimal polynomial' while we have factorizations like $\sin x = 2 \cos (x/2) \cdot \sin (x/2)$?","['galois-theory', 'transcendental-numbers', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"
94997,Something interesting that I found about some numbers - and would like to see if it's known,"Well I am quite sure it's known (I mean number theory exists thousands of years), warning beforehand, it may look like numerology, but I try not to go to mysticism. So I was in a bus, and from boredom I started just adding numbers in the next way: $$1+1=2$$ $$2+2=4$$ $$4+4=8$$ $$....$$ etc. up to $32,768$ (it was quite boring, I can tell... :-)), I didn't have calculator. And notice that if I keep adding the digits until I get a number from 1 to 10, I get that for example for $8+8=16$ , $1+6=7$ , now seven steps after this, at $512+512=1024$ , which $1+2+4=7$ , and again after $7$ steps $32768+32768=65536$ , and adding $6+5+5+3+6=10+12+3=25$ , $2+5=7$ . So this led me to the conjecture that this repetition may occur endlessly. Now, of course I can program some code that will check for large numbers, but I am tired, long day. So, if this indeed the case (which could be disproved, but even then I would wonder when this repetition stops) then why? As I said, I am tired, it may make no sense, and I might have done mistakes in my calculations, and it may be trivial. Either way, if you have some answer, I would like to hear it.","['recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"

95024,$f_n(x)$ convergence in measure implies $\frac{|f_n(x)-f(x)|}{1+|f_n(x)-f(x)|}$ convergence almost everywhere,"Let $E\subset\mathbb{R},m(E)<+\infty$, $\{f_n(x)\}$ are measurable functions defined on $E$. Then $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges to $f(x)$ in measure $\Leftrightarrow$ $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|f_n(x)-f(x)|}{1+|f_n(x)-f(x)|}=0, a.e. x\in E.$$
I think it's easy to see how to go from right to left since $\frac{|f_n(x)-f(x)|}{1+|f_n(x)-f(x)|}<\epsilon\Rightarrow|f_n(x)-f(x)|<2\epsilon$ and almost everywhere convergence implies convergence in measure.

95026,Prove that the limit does not go to 6,I want to prove that $$ \lim_{x \to 2}  \ x + 3 \ne 6 $$ What I thought about doing was first assuming the limit actually equaled $6$. Then taking an $x$ below and above $3$ and then finding a contradiction form the two statements 1) choosing $x = 1.5$ we get $|0.5|< \delta \implies |0.5| < \epsilon$ 2) choosing $x = 2.5$ we get $|0.5|< \delta \implies |1.5| < \epsilon$ Then choose an epsilon equal $1$ and use the contrapostive of $2$ but I am not sure exactly how to phrase this.,['limits']
