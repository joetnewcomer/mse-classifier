  $$f\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)=\frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2}$$

But I want more of a geometrical approach to the problem. I feel that the given equations are related to the bisection formula of a line.

1434796,Can one complete a topological space induced by a family of pseudometrics?,"Suppose I have a set $X$ and a family $\{d_i\vert i \in I\}$ of pseudometrics on $X$. For each pseudometric $d_i$ you get a metric space by taking $X_i = X/\sim$ where $x\sim y \iff d_i(x,y)=0$. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the initial topology induced by the projections $p_i : X \to X_i$. Let's further say that the family is definite, i.e. $d_i(x,y)=0 \, \forall i \implies x=y$. Can we always construct a completion of $X$ that completes all $X_i$? Is there a name for topological spaces that can be obtained this way or can every topological space be constructed by this?  What if every pseudometric is complete? This question came to my mind when trying to generalize this approach to Caratheodorys measurability criterion and theorem on non-$\sigma$-finite spaces by setting $d_A(X,Y) = m^*(A\cap (X\triangle Y))$ for every $A$ with $m^*(A)<\infty$.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"

1434813,Different shapes made from particular number of squares,"Good day! I’m currently investigating how different shapes can be made from a particular number of squares.
I have two major concerns: (1) Will there be a formula predicting the number of shapes that can be made from a certain number of squares without the flipping and rotation of formed shapes; and (2) how about with flipping and rotation?

1434832,Why is the identity map of the circle not straight-line homotopic to a constant map?,"According to the book 'Introduction to Topology. Pure and Applied' by C Adams & R Franzosa : $\boldsymbol{\sf THEOREM\ 9.9.}$ A circle function $f : S^1 \rightarrow  S^1$ has degree $0$ if and only if $f$ extends to a continuous function on the disk $D$ (that is, if and only if there exists a continuous function $F : D \rightarrow  S^1$ such that $F (x) = f (x)$ for all $x\in S^1$). I read the proof and it seems cool! But, the contradiction of the theorem itself is that : If $f$ is the identity function, i.e. if $f (\theta) = \theta$ (degree $1$), it still is extendable on the Disk and a straight-line homotopy $F(\theta, t) = (1-t) f (\theta)$ deforms $f (\theta)$ to a constant map which has degree $0$. Contradiction? PS - Please let me know to add the proof below if it's necessary but I think the proof is irrelevant. Proof. Throughout the proof, we represent the points in the disk with polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$. $\quad$ First, assume that $f$ extends to a continuous function $F:D\to S^1$. Define a function $G:S^1\times I\to S^1$ by $G(\theta,t)=F(t,\theta)$. Since $F$ is continuous, so is $G$. Therefore $G$ is homotopy between the circle functions $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ and $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$, implying that these functions have the same degree. The function $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ is given by $$G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}(\theta)=G(\theta,0)=F(0,\theta)=F(0,0).$$ It follows that $G|_{S^1\times\{0\}}$ is a constant function and therefore has degree $0$. Thus, $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$ also has degree $0$. It is straightforward to see that $G|_{S^1\times\{1\}}$ is equal to $f$, implying that $f$ has degree $0$, as desired. $\quad$ Now assume that $f$ has degree $0$. Therefore there exists a homotopy $G:S^1\times I\to S^1$ such that $G(\theta,0)=c_0(\theta)$ and $G(\theta,1)=f(\theta)$, where $c_0:S^1\to S^1$ is the constant function sending each point $\theta\in S^1$ to the point $0\in S^1$. Define $F:D\to S^1$ by $F(r,\theta)=G(\theta,r)$. Since $G(\theta,r)$ is constant in $\theta$ when $r=0$, it follows that $F$ is well defined at $r=0$ and therefore is defined as a function on $D$. Furthermore, $G$ being continuous implies that $F$ is  as well. Finally, $F(1,\theta)=G(\theta,1)=f(\theta)$, implying that $F$ is an extension of $f$. $\tag*{${\blacksquare}{}$}$","['homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"

The countable union of closed set is closed in $\mathbb{Z}$ when $u_{j} \neq 0$. (unsure about this step!) Because $V$ has finite dimension, we have a basis $\{ u_{1}, ..., u_{k} \}$ of $V$. Also, $u \in$ Span$(u_{1}, ..., u_{k}, u)$. But, we have that $V$ is closed in Span$(u_{1}, ..., u_{k}, u)$ with $v_{n} \to u$, and then $u \in V. \square$ Svetoslav's answer rewritten Recall that

The series 
\begin{equation*}
||u||_{p}^{p} = \sum\limits_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} |u_{j}|^{p} < \infty,

let $S_n := \sum\limits_{j\in\mathbb Z,j\leq |n|} |u_{j}|^{p}$ be the partial sums of the series and let $A=\sum\limits_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} |u_{j}|^{p} < \infty$ be its sum. 
By the definition for convergent series, given $\epsilon >0$, there exists $N\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n>N$ we have

1434979,Find All $x$ values where $f(x)$ is Perfect Square,"Is there a formula, method or anyway to find all positive $x$ integer values (if exists) such that $f(x)$ is Perfect square where $f(x)$ is a quadratic equation? For example if I have the following function: \begin{align*} 
    f(x)= 4x^2+84x-15
\end{align*}
Then I need all integer x values which makes $f(x)$ Perfect Squares. I know for this equation $x \in \{2,10,19,47\}$ but I knew this by guessing, I mean I wrote a program in java and I traversed all of x values from 1 to 1000 and I got this set of x values that gives me a perfect square, I am not sure if I have to go further and what is the bound to do this guessing. But I am not interested in such method. I am interested in a generalization for this problem (if possible) where I need to know all x values which makes $f(x)$ square where: \begin{align*}
f(x) = ax^2+bx+c \tag{1} 
\end{align*} where 
\begin{align}
a,b,c \in \mathbb Z
\end{align} Update 1 I have found a way from my derived equations of my research where I can find  \begin{align*}
x_i \, | \  \sqrt{f(x_i)}\in \mathbb Z
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
where\ i=1,2\ and\ x_1 > x_2
\end{align*}
The question now, is there a way to use $x_1,x_2$ to find any other $x_i$ (if exist)
\begin{align*}
where \quad i>2 \ \ and\ \ 0 < x_i < x_2
\end{align*} For the mentioned example, I know that the equation has $x_1 = 47$ and $x_2 = 19$, is there a way to find $ 0 < x_3 < 19 $ if $x_3$ exists from the known $x_1$ and $x_2$? Update 2 After reading @ColmBhandal note I am trying in this update to transform the original equation to another equation. Resolving the new equation will resolve the previous equation. Since $a$ in my case is always square then to get $x$ where $f(x)$ a perfect square we need to resolve the following:
\begin{align*}
bx+c=2nsx+n^2\  where\ s=\sqrt{a},\ n >= 1, n\in\mathbb Z
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
x=g(n)=\frac{n^2-c}{b-2sn}\tag{2}
\end{align*}
Now this is a Diophantine equation in the following form (assign $x=Y$ and $n=X$):
\begin{align*}
X^2-bY+2sXY-c=0\tag{3}
\end{align*}
Now we need to find $n$|$n>1\ and\ n\in\mathbb Z$ which makes $g(n)\in\mathbb Z$. Let's note the following: $n$ has min value when $numerator = denominator$ (this happens to get $n=1$)which is
\begin{align*}
n^2-c = b-2sn 
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
n^2+2sn-b-c = 0\implies\ n>= \Bigg\lceil {\frac{-(2s)+\sqrt{(2s)^2-(4(-b-c))}}{2}}\ \Bigg\rceil
\end{align*} $n$ has a max value when the $denominator=0$ which is
\begin{align*}
b-2sn=0\implies n < \frac{b}{2s}
\end{align*} We can get the first biggest two $n$ values because we know $x_1$ and $x_2$. So for the mentioned example since $a=4$ then $s=2$ which lets $x=g(n)$ is
\begin{align*}
g(n)=\frac{n^2+15}{84-4n}\quad where\ n\in\mathbb Z, 7<=n<21
\end{align*}
We also know that $n_1=19\ and\ n_2=17$ because $x_1=47\ and\ x_2=19$ so actually we are looking for $n$ (if exists)
\begin{align*}
7<= n < 17\ |\ n\in\mathbb Z
\end{align*} So we need now the integer solutions for this equation. I hope this equation now could be resolved, I think it is a Diophantine Equation and we need integer solutions for it because the equation looks like:
\begin{align*}
x^2-84y+4xy+15=0
\end{align*} Update 3 After reading this paper , I found (on page 6) that equation (3) could be transformed to
\begin{align*}
(bx + e)(by + d) = ed − bf
\end{align*}
Then writing $ed − bf = N$ and if $N$ is not zero (which is in our case) then we can factorize N to get all integer solutions. Unfortunately, This means that my new Diophantine Equation number (3) should be resolved by factoring. My question now is this the only way to solve such equations?
Is there a way to solve equation (1) or (3) without completing the square or factoring a number to get solutions? Notes: Completing the square method and solving Pell's equation needs at the end of the day to do factoring and because in my case the coefficients could be 40-50 digits numbers, factorization couldn't be a solution. I am looking for a generalization for the problem and write a computer program to solve such equations with a very large coefficients. Therefore any method that needs factorization or to iterate linearly to find the solutions are not helpful .

1435002,Why are numerical solutions preferred to analytical solutions?,"I'm just learning about optimization, and the difference between an analytical solution, and a numerical one. Suppose there is a cost function f(x) , and we want to find the value of x which minimizes this. In an analytical solution, we would differentiate with respect to x , i.e. find df(x)/dx . Whereas in a numerical solution, we would try values of x , and see in which direction we need to change x in order to move towards the solution (gradient descent). It seems to me that the analytical solution is always preferred because it gives you an exact answer. You do not get stuck in local minima and you can be sure that your solution is correct. So why do we not always use analytical solutions? I understand that numerical solutions make things easier because you don't have to work out by hand the analytical solution, but it seems to me that solving something by hand to get a precise answer is highly preferred to doing it computationally for an approximate answer.

1435065,What is the difference between partial and normal derivatives?,"I have a clarifying question about this question: What is the difference between $d$ and $\partial$? I understand the idea that $\frac{d}{dx}$ is the derivative where all variables are assumed to be functions of other variables, while with $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ one assumes that $x$ is the only variable and every thing else is a constant (as stated in one of the answers). Example 1 : If $z = xa + x$, then I would guess that
$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = a + 1
$$
and
$$
\frac{d z}{d x} = a + x\frac{da}{dx} + 1.
$$
since now $a$ should be considered a function. When we in calculus 1 have $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, then technically we should use $\partial$ as we are assuming $a, b$, and $c$ are constants? Is this correct? Example 2 : Maybe the thing that is confusing me is that when we do implicit differentiation we use $d$. So if
$$
x^2 + y^2 = 1
$$
then taking $\frac{d}{dx}$ gives
$$
2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
$$
again because $y$ is considered a function. How would taking $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ of an equation like $x^2 + y^2 =1$ work? Does that even make sense? Example 3 : Is it ever possible that using $\partial$ and $d$ can give the same? If, for example $y = x^2$, does it make sense to say that
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} y = 2x?
$$ Edit: My overall question, I guess, is how the notations of partial derivatives vs. ordinary derivatives are formally defined. I am looking for a bit more background.","['partial-derivative', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

It is assumed that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is primitive modulo $2$: If $C$ is defined to be the remainder of $A^{2^m-1}\pmod{4}$ , i.e.
  $$A^{2^m-1}\equiv I+2C \pmod{4}$$
  Then prove
  $$\textrm{det}(C)\equiv \textrm{det}(C+I)\equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$ My try:
$$2C\equiv A^{2^m-1}-I\pmod{4}\Rightarrow C\equiv \frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}-I)\pmod{2}$$ $$ \textrm{det}(C)\equiv \textrm{det}(\frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}-I)) \pmod{2}$$ Then for $C+I$
$$C+I\equiv \frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}-I)+I \equiv \frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}+I)\pmod{2}$$ Therefore to prove the statement we must have:
  $$ \textrm{det}(\frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}-I))\equiv \textrm{det}(\frac{1}{2}(A^{2^m-1}+I)) \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $$ Or $$\frac{1}{2^m}\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}-I)\equiv \frac{1}{2^m}\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}+I) \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$
$$\Rightarrow\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}-I)\equiv \textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}+I) \equiv 2^{m} \pmod{2^{m+1}}$$
If we call $P_{A^{2^m-1}}(\lambda)$ the characteristic polynomial of $A^{2^m-1}$ then I know that $\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}-\lambda I)\equiv P_{A^{2^m-1}}(\lambda)$, and therefore
$$\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}-I)= P_{A^{2^m-1}}(1)\,,\textrm{det}(A^{2^m-1}+I)= P_{A^{2^m-1}}(-1)$$ EDIT: I've found out here that if eigenvalues of $A$ are $y_i$ then eigenvalues of $A^n$ will be $y_i^n$, however $y_i$ might be complex. Therefore:
$$P_{A}(\lambda)=\prod_{i=0}^m(\lambda-y_i)\Rightarrow P_{A^{2^m-1}}(\lambda)=\prod_{i=0}^m(\lambda-y_i^{2^m-1})$$
Then I tried to compute each coefficient of $P_{A^{2^m-1}}$ in terms of coefficients of  $P_{A}$, which leads to some kind of generalization of Newton identities I asked it here , however it seems it is not possible to compute all of them (Question has received no general answer yet). I couldn't continue it further. Notes: I've tested a few matrices (of degrees 2,3,4,5) with computer and the statement was true for them. Primitive here means that the characteristic polynomial of $A$, $q(t)=\textrm{det}(A-tI)=t^m+a_1t^{m-1}+\ldots+a_m$, be primitive (irreducible) modulo 2.

With this definition it is clear that $\mathcal H^k_\delta \leq \mathcal S^k_\delta$. But it is also true that $\mathcal S^k_\delta\leq 2^k \mathcal H^k_\delta.$ My question is: why is this true? I've though that, for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta$-covering $\{E_j\}$ of $E$ such that $$\sum_j \alpha _k\frac{\text{ diam}E_j^k}{2^k}\leq\sum_j \alpha^k \text{ diam}E_j^k\leq 2^k\mathcal H^k_\delta(E)+2^k\epsilon.$$ 
Now, I would finished the proof if I could assume that the covering $\{E_j\}$ is made by balls, because I would have
$$\mathcal S^k_\delta(E)\leq\sum_j\alpha_k \frac{\text{ diam}E_j^k}{2^k}\leq\sum_j \alpha^k \text{ diam}E_j^k\leq 2^k\mathcal H^k_\delta(E)+2^k\epsilon,$$ and by the arbitrariety of $\epsilon$ it would follow $\mathcal S^k_\delta\leq 2^k \mathcal H^k_\delta.$ Can I assume this?

For solving this problem I'm trying to use following exercise from Atiyah and Macdonald book: Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unit, $X = \mathrm{Spec}(A) $ with the Zariski topology. Then the irreducible components  of $X$ are $\lbrace V(p) : p\subset A \ \text{minimal prime ideal} \rbrace$ where $V(p) =\lbrace q \ \text{prime ideal } \mid p\subset q\rbrace$. So, we need to find minimal prime ideals $p$ of $R/I^n$. Suppose $p$ is a minimal prime ideal of $R/I^n$, that means $p$ is a prime ideal of $k[x,y,z]$ that contains $(xy,yz,zx)$ and $(x)^n$, which is equivalent to say that $p$ contains $(x,y)$ or $(x,z)$. Also as $(x,y)$ and $(x,z)$ are prime ideals in $k[x,y,z]$ hence the irreducible components are $V(x,z)$ and $V(x,y)$.

1435478,"Rationals $(\mathbb{Q},<)$ are isomorphic to a part of a finite partition","I believe the following statement is true but I can't find or figure out a proof: For any partition of the set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rationals into a finite number of parts, there is a part containing an isomorphic copy of $\mathbb{Q}$ (preserving the < relation) This is hinted at in passing in a paper by Hasson, Kojman and Onshuus (www.math.bgu.ac.il/~kojman/symindiv.pdf) who call this property 'indivisibility'. I think IF I can prove (and it is true) that any finite partition of $\mathbb{Q}$ must include a part containing an interval $\mathbb{Q}\cap(a,b)$ then I can use the function $f(x)=a + \frac{1+x/(1+|x|)}{2(b-a)}$.

  $$p^2 \mid q^3 + 1 \tag{A}$$

I'm looking for any solution I may have missed, and generally any alternative method that might reduce the case work (could combine cases 2.1 and 3.1, I suppose). I will split the work into three cases: $p=q\ge2$. $p>q\ge2$. $q>p\ge2$. Case 1 It is clear that neither (A) nor (B) are met. Case 2 First consider two subcases: $p>q$ and $q\in\{2,3\}$. $p>q\ge5$. Case 2.1 $$\begin{align}
q=2 &\implies p^2\mid9  &\implies p^2=9 &\implies p=3 \\
q=3 &\implies p^2\mid28 &\implies p^2=4 &\implies\text{ no solution} \\
\end{align}$$ So $\boxed{(p,q)=(3,2)}$ is the only solution for this case. Case 2.2 (A) factorises as $p^2 \mid (q+1)(q^2-q+1)$. Now $$q^2-q+1=(q+1)(q-2)+3 \implies \gcd(q+1,q^2-q+1)=
\begin{cases} 3,\quad\text{if }3\mid q+1\\1,\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ Since $p>5$ is prime, we must have either $p^2\mid q+1$ or $p^2\mid q^2-q+1$. But this is impossible because $p>q\ge5 \implies p^2>q+1\text{ and }p^2>q^2>q^2-q+1$. So there are no solutions here. Case 3 Consider two subcases: $q>p$ and $p\in\{2,3\}$. $q>p\ge5$. Case 3.1 $$\begin{align}
p=2 &\implies q^2\mid63 &\implies q^2=9 &\implies q=3 \\
p=3 &\implies q^2\mid728 &\implies q^2=4 &\implies\text{ no solution} \\
\end{align}$$ So $\boxed{(p,q)=(2,3)}$ is the only solution for this case. Case 3.2 (B) factorises as $q^2 \mid (p^3+1)(p^3-1)$. Now $$p^3+1=(p^3-1)+2 \implies \gcd(p^3+1,p^3-1)=
\begin{cases} 2,\quad\text{if }p\text{ is odd}\\1,\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ Since $q>5$ is prime, we must have either $q^2\mid p^3+1$ or $q^2\mid p^3-1$. If $q^2\mid p^3+1$, the the same arguments as in case 2.2 can be applied to show that $q^2\mid p+1$ or $q^2\mid p^2-p+1$ neither of which is possible when $q>p$. So the only remaining possibility is $q^2\mid p^3-1$. This factorises as $q^2\mid (p-1)(p^2+p+1)$. Now $$p^2+p+1=(p-1)(p+2)+3 \implies \gcd(p-1,p^2+p+1)=
\begin{cases} 3,\quad\text{if }3\mid p-1\\1,\quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ Since $q>5$ is prime, we must have either $q^2\mid p-1$ or $q^2\mid p^2+p+1$. But this is impossible because $q>p\ge5 \implies q^2>p-1\text{ and }q^2\ge (p+1)^2=p^2+2p+1>p^2+p+1$.

Does this seem correct? Update Based on Conrado Costa's answer, I think the proper definition for the regular conditional probability given $X$ should be as follows.  Below, let $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \to (E, \mathcal{E})$. Assume the regular conditional probability given $\sigma(X)$ exists.  That is, there exists a function $\mathbf{P}^2 : \Omega \times \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ such that $\forall F \in \mathcal{F}$, $\omega \mapsto \mathbf{P}^2(\omega,F)$ is a version of $\mathbf{P}(F \mid \sigma({X}))$, $\forall \omega \in \Omega$, $F \mapsto \mathbf{P}^2(\omega, F)$ is a probability measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. In particular, property 1 tells us that $\forall F \in \mathcal{F}$, $\omega \mapsto \mathbf{P}^2(\omega,F)$ is $(\sigma(X), \mathcal{B}[0,1])$-measurable.  Then, by Theorem 18 listed below in Conrado Costa's answer, there exists a function $\mathbf{P}^1: E \times \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ that is $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{B}[0,1])$-measurable such that $\forall F \in \mathcal{F}$, $\omega \mapsto \mathbf{P}^2(\omega,F) = \mathbf{P}^1(X(\omega),F)$. So, for any $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and any $C \in \sigma(X)$, by the change of variables theorem we get
\begin{align*}
\int_{X(C)} \mathbf{P}^1(x,F) \, d\Lambda_X(x) & = \int_C \mathbf{P}^2(\omega,F) \, dP(\omega) \\
& = \int_C \mathbf{P}(F \mid \sigma(X))(\omega) \, dP(\omega) \\
& = \int_C E(\mathbb{I}_F \mid \sigma(X))(\omega) \, dP(\omega) \\

A well known result is: The sequence $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a\in \mathbb{R}$ if and only if every subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a\in \mathbb{R}$. Now, I'm working on an exercise which essentialy asks to prove the following: The sequence $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a\in \mathbb{R}$ if and only if for every subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ there is a (sub)subsequence $(x_{n_{k_j}})_{j\in \mathbb{N}}$ which converges to $a$. Now, one direction is trivial. If in fact $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a$, then by the result I've mentioned, every subsequence of $(x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $a$. Let then $(x_{n_k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ be an arbitrary subsequence. In that case, we know that it is a subsequence of itself, and hence we've found a (sub)subsequence which converges to $a$. The other way around seems quite complicated for me. The reason is as follows: I must assume that every subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ has a (sub)subsequence which converges to $a$ and the proof that the original one converges to $a$. My problem is exactly that "" a "". If it had all (sub)subsequences converging to $a$, then by the result i've mentionted, the subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ would converge to $a$. In that case, we would have every subsequence converging to $a$ and the result would follow. My idea to prove the claim was then: First remember that a subsequence is the restriction of the original one $x: \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ to an infinite subset $\mathbb{N}'\subset \mathbb{N}$. In that case a (sub)subsequence is the restriction of $\tilde{x} = x|\mathbb{N}'$ to an infinite subset $\mathbb{N}''\subset \mathbb{N}$. But since $\tilde{x}$ is the restriction of $x$ to $\mathbb{N}'$ and since $\mathbb{N}''\subset \mathbb{N}'$, the restriction of $\tilde{x}$ to $\mathbb{N}''$ is itself the restriction of $x$ to $\mathbb{N}''$. In other words, every (sub)subsequence can be viewed as a subsequence of the original one. Considering this, by hypothesis every subsequence has a (sub)subsequence which converges to $a$. But by this argument, this means that we can replace every subsequence with a convergent one. And then we can use the result I stated. Is my idea correct? Is this really the way to prove the claim? My only doubt is that I need every subsequence converging to $a$ to use the result. In this case I can't see how I can argue that this implies every subsequence converges to $a$. How can I finish this proof?","['sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

Attempt at a solution I've already proved this statement for $f:E \to \mathbb R$ with $E$ of finite measure. My idea was to partition $\mathbb R$ in disjoint intervals of the form $[k,k+1)$ for $k$ integer, then, on each of these intervals extract a closed set $F_k$ such that $f$ is continuous on this set and such that when I take the countable union of the complement of each $F_k$, the measure of this union is less than $\epsilon$. Then I could linearly extend $f$ to the union such that the extension $g$ is continuous on the real line. So, suppose the statement is true for sets of finite measure. For each $k$ integer, there exists $F_k$ closed set such that $m({F_k}^c)<\dfrac{\epsilon}{2^{|k|}}$ and $f|_{F_k}$ is continuous. Now $G=\bigcup_{k \in \mathbb N} {F_k}^c$ is an open set, so it can be expressed as a union of disjoint intervals, that means, $G=\bigcup_{k \in \mathbb N}(a_k,b_k)$.

If we used inclusion-exclusion, $|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| = |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap C \cap C|$ Why would you exclude $|A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C|$ ? That would be getting rid of yellow, purple, and baby blue. Is there something I'm missing? I would say there are 7 possible colors per object, therefore, the number of ways to color n objects with 3 colors would be $n^7$.","['inclusion-exclusion', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
1435903,$L^p$ submartingale convergence theorem,"In class today, we learned about the familiar $L^p$ martingale convergence theorem: For $p >1,$ if $X_n$ is a martingale with $\sup \mathbb{E}|X_n|^p <\infty$, then $X_n \rightarrow X$ a.s. and in $L^p$. Comparing this result with many other convergence theorems, we find that is requires X to be a martingale instead of just a submartingale. I assume this must have some reason, i.e. this result does not hold for submartingales. Intuitively, I would assume that this is caused by something related to a restriction to the nonnegativity of the submartingale, i.e. the result will not hold when $X_n$ is a negative submartingale. Is this true? Or does the theorem also hold for submartingales?

  $X$. Proof. $E$ is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. Let $\{x_n\} \subset E$ such that $x_n \to x$. We claim that
  $x \in E$. Since $x_n$ converges, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists
  an $N$, such that for all $n \geq N$, $d(x,x_n) < \epsilon.$ By the triangle inequality $d(p,x) \leq d(p, x_n) + d(x_n, x)$ and so
  $d(p,x) < r + \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon > 0$. So, at the least

Now, I try to employ spectral method - collocation method to solve Orr-Sommerfeld(OS) equation. I've already solved the eigenvalue problem of Poiseuille flow. And I want to move to Boundary layer instability., during which I come across a problem concerning coordinates transformation. The problem is mainly a mathematical one. Specificlly, OS equation is as follows. $$
(U-c)(D^{2}-\alpha^{2})\phi - U^{\prime \prime}\phi = \frac{1}{i \alpha Re} (D^{4}-2\alpha^{2}D^{2}+\alpha^{4})\phi
$$ Mean velocity profile of Poiseuille flow is $U = 1 - x^{2}, -1 <= x <= 1$. What I concerns is c, wave speed, also eigenvalue. I treat OS equation as a general eigenvalue problem, which leads OS equation to be of the form $A \phi = c B \phi$, where both A and B are operators. $$
A = \frac{-1}{\alpha Re} (D^4 - 2 \alpha^2 D^2 + \alpha^4) + i U (D^2 - \alpha^2) - i U^{\prime \prime}
$$ $$
B = i (D^2 - \alpha^2)
$$ By some eigenvalue solver, eigenvalues can be solved. Mathematically, eigenvalues are determined by operators A and B. Ok, I finish the above. Then I consider coordinate transformation. Take a simple example as translation: $y = x + 1$. It translates field from $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ to $0 \leq y \leq 2$. Since the field is translated, operators A and B should be changed to be defined on the new field. Specifically, partial differential operator $D, D^2, D^4$ and velocity profile $U, U^{\prime \prime}$ should be changed. In this case, coordinate transformation is just translation. So, partial differential operator is unchanged and velocity profile becomes $U = -y^2 + 2y, U^{\prime \prime} = -2$. All in all, what changes in this eigenvalue problem $A \phi = c B \phi$ is only velocity profile. It seems operator indeed changes, which results in different eigenvalues from original ones. Then there exists contradiction. I mean, mathematically, different operators in eigenvalue problem will lead to different eigenvalues. Meanwhile, physically, coordinate translation leads to the same eigenvalues. In fact, I do get same eigenvalues numerically by spectral method - collocation method.

1436617,Limit points of particular sets of real numbers.,"How to find  limit points of the following sets of real numbers, for irrational $\alpha$  ? $(1)$ $\{ m+n\alpha:m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$ $(2)$ $\{ m+n\alpha:m\in\mathbb{N},n\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$ $(3)$ $\{ m+n\alpha:m\in\mathbb{Z},n\in\mathbb{N}\}.$ $(4)$ $\{ m+n\alpha:m,n\in\mathbb{N}\}.$ There is a result, which says that every additive subgroup of the group  $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is either discrete or dense in $\mathbb{R}.$ Therefore using this fact we can say that set in  $(1)$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}.$ I think set in $(4)$ has no limit point because of $m,n\in\mathbb{N}.$ But I don't know how to find limit points of there sets. Please explain. Thanks in advance.","['irrational-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
