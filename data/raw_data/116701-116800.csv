1718302,Absolute continuity on limit,"In probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$, we have random variable $X$ that maps $\Omega$ into $R$. Assume $\mathbb{E}{|X|}<\infty$ and let $A_n$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{F}$ satysfying $\lim_{n \to \infty} P(A_n)=0$. Prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{A_n} X dP =0$. I have proved it when we know $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$ exists: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{A_n} X dP = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{\Omega} 1_{A_n}X dP $ Since  $|X 1_{A_n}| \leq |X|$ , we can use Dominated convergence theorem. Therefore, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{A_n} X dP = \int_{\Omega} \lim_{n \to \infty}  1_{A_n}X dP  = \int_{\Omega}   1_{ \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n}X dP  = \int_{\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n}   X dP $ Then, by absolute continuity, I have claimed that $\lim_{n \to \infty} P(A_n)=0$ yields $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{A_n} X dP =0$. But, how we can prove this when we don't know $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$ exists?","['lebesgue-integral', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"

You can find an example of the usage of the word generic for example here : ""School on Generic Singularities in Geometry"" or here : 
""Rigidity of generic singularities of mean curvature flow"" Here is what I have so far: I found this article by Thom which mentions ""... ""generic"" singularities, i.e., singularities that appear for almost all maps ..."" Just after that he mentions ""generic maps"" but does not elaborate on what it means. He mentions it later (kind of) by saying ""...The precise definition of a generic map is very delicate; for the
moment, we say only that any map may be approached by a generic map (up to an
approximation on the derivatives of order r), and that any map that is sufficiently close to
a generic map, in the preceding sense, is itself generic. ..."" and later  on he gives a definition of ""generic singularity of a singular set"": ""... A critical point $x$ of $S_r$ will be called transversally critical , or, furthermore, generic , if the tangent planes to $ \overline{f}(\mathbb R^n) $ and $F_r$ are in general position at the
point $\overline{f} (x)$ of the Grassmannian, which is assumed to be ordinary on $F_r$ . ..."" Does this mean that generic and transversally critical are synonyms?

1718588,Is the regularization of a Fourier transform unique?,"The Fourier transform of the Coulomb potential $1/\vert \mathbf r \vert$   of an electric charge doesn't converge because one obtains
$$F(k)=\frac {4\pi}{k} \int_0^\infty \sin(kr) dr.$$ The standard way to obtain a sensible value is to multiple the integrand by $f(\alpha,r)=e^{-\alpha r}$ and after doing the integral, taking the limit $\alpha\to 0$ (which has a nice physical reason). So one gets 
$$F(k)=\frac{4\pi}{k^2}.$$ Would any other function $f(\alpha,r)$ that makes the integral converge and that satisfies $\lim_{\alpha\to\alpha_0}f(\alpha,r)=1$ give the same result?  For example
$$F(k)=\lim_{\alpha\to 0}\frac {4\pi}{k} \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(kr)}{\Gamma(\alpha r)} dr\stackrel{?}{=}\frac{4\pi}{k^2}.$$ In this case, Cesàro integration gives the same result.

1718897,What is the probability of getting $3$ triples before a single quad in a $52$ card deck?,"Suppose I have a well shuffled standard deck of $52$ cards.  I draw them one at a time (without replacement) and sort the chosen cards by rank so that it is easy for me to see pairs, triples, quads....  I want to know what is the probability of seeing exactly three triples (such as $5,5,5$, $3,3,3$, $K,K,K$) before seeing a quad (such as $10,10,10,10$).  Note that the triples and quad need not be in any order, they can have other ""irrelevant"" cards drawn in between them. Just to clarify, the triple and quads do not need to be consecutive cards.  For example, if the first $6$ cards drawn are $3,5,6,5,K,5$, then that is a triple for the $5$s. Note that when we either see $3$ triples or one quad, we are done with that hand.  No other cards will be drawn.  So for example, if you have $3,3,3,5,5,7,7,7$ so far (and all the other drawn cards are singles, then another $3$ or $5$ draw will immediately stop the hand but for different reasons.  We will either have quad $3$s at that point or $3$ triples.  A drawn $7$ would also stop this sample hand. A quad winner would be something like $K,K,K,7,7,7,3,3,K$ with any ""irrelevant"" single or double (paired) cards interspersed such as $2,J,9...$. Just for ""extra"" clarity, a quad does NOT also count as a triple.  A triple becomes a quad and loses its triple status if the $4$th card of that same rank is drawn in the same hand. For even more clarity (I didn't know this question would be ambiguous), I am $NOT$ asking for $3$ triples followed by a quad before seeing the $4$th triple.  I am saying all you have to see is $3$ triples without seeing a quad and you can stop that hand and it is counted as a winner.  Sorry for any confusion. I thought it was clearly stated but now that I reread the title it is a little confusing but not if you read the examples it shouldn't be.",['probability']

1719001,Prove that $x^2+1$ cannot be a perfect square for any positive integer x?,"I started this problem by trying proof by contradiction. I first noted that the problem stated that $x$ had to be a positive integer, and thus $x=0$ could not be a solution. I then assumed that $x^2+1=n^2$ for some integer $n$ other than $1$. From here I have tried various methods, to no avail: Factoring: $n^2-x^2=1\implies(n+x)(n-x)=1$. It would be nice if I could say $(n+x)=(n-x)=1$ and $(n+x)=(n-x)=-1$. However, the issue here is that $(n+x)$ and $(n-x)$ could take on any value. For example, $(n+x)=2$ and $(n-x)=\frac{1}{2}$, or $(n+x)=3$ and $(n-x)=\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, I ruled out factoring. For any number $n$, $n\equiv 0 \pmod4$ or $n\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. The trouble with this is that I would have to prove the above statement, so I ruled this out. Does anyone have any tips on how to continue?

1719023,Generating continuous random variables from a set of Bernoullis,"Given a set of $Bernoulli(p_i)$ variables with each having its own arbitrary $p_i$, is there an efficient way to generate continuous random variables sampled from an arbitrary distriubution?  To further specify, continuous in this context would refer to discrete N-bit numbers.  For example generating a 32-bit integer from the Normal distribution. The naive way seems to be generating a uniform() distribution using Bernoulli(.5), then using standard rv algorithms such as the Box-Muller transform.  However this seems rather bloated considering only a single probability ($p_i = .5$) is used. I was considering a solution in which each Bernoulli represents a bit of the number and $p_i = 1-CDF(x)$ where x is the bit's order of significance.  This would require calculating N expensive CDF functions though. Is there a better way to manipulate $p_i$ to generate samples more efficiently?","['probability-theory', 'sampling', 'probability', 'statistics']"
1719033,Trigonometric substitution $\tan{\frac{x}{2}}=t$. What is $\cos{x}$ then?,"For example, the integral is:
$$\int \frac{\sin{x}}{3\sin{x}+4\cos{x}}dx$$
And we use the substitution: $\tan{\frac{x}{2}}=t$ Now, to get $\cos{x}$ in terms of $\tan\frac{x}{2}$, I first expressed $\cos^2\frac{x}{2}$ and $\sin^2\frac{x}{2}$ in temrs of $\tan\frac{x}{2}$:
$$\cos^2\frac{x}{2}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\cos^2\frac{x}{2}}}=\frac{1}{\frac{\sin^2\frac{x}{2}+\cos^2\frac{x}{2}}{\cos^2\frac{x}{2}}}=\frac{1}{1+\tan^2\frac{x}{2}}=\frac{1}{1+t^2}$$
$$\sin^2\frac{x}{2}=1-\cos^2\frac{x}{2}=1-\frac{1}{1+t^2}=\frac{t^2}{1+t^2}$$
Now, using trig idendity: $\cos{2x}=\cos^2{x}-\sin^2{x}$ we have:
$$\cos{x}=\bigg(\cos^2\frac{x}{2}-\sin^2\frac{x}{2}\bigg)=\frac{1}{1+t^2}-\frac{t^2}{1+t^2}=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}$$
which is good, but, I don't know what is wrong with this next procedure (first, getting $\sin^2{x}$, then using trig identity $\sin^2{x}+\cos^2{x}=1$ getting $\cos{x}$). So, first, expressing $\sin{x}$ in terms of $\tan\frac{x}{2}$ using trig identity $\sin{2x}=2\sin{x}\cos{x}$: $$\sin^2{x}=4\sin^2\frac{x}{2}\cos^2\frac{x}{2}=4\cdot\frac{t^2}{1+t^2}\cdot\frac{1}{1+t^2}=\frac{4t^2}{(1+t^2)^2}$$
So:
$$\cos^2{x}=1-\sin^2{x}=1-\frac{4t^2}{(1+t^2)^2}=\frac{t^4-2t^2+1-4t^2}{(1+t^2)^2}=\frac{(t^2-1)^2}{(t^2+1)^2}$$
And, $\cos{x}$ is then:
$$\cos{x}=\pm\frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}$$

1719104,Does the category of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$ change when $p$ changes?,"EDIT I've now posted this question on mathoverflow . It probably makes sense to post answers over there, unless someone prefers posting here. Let $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ denote the category of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$, with all homomorphisms as morphisms. The question is: when is there an equivalence of categories between $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ and $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ (with the expected answer being: only when $p=l$)? Here are some easy observations: First, any equivalence of categories must do the obvious thing on objects, preserving transcendence degree because $K$ has a smaller transcendence degree than $L$ if and only if there is a morphism $K \to L$ but not $L \to K$. We can distinguish the case $p=0$ from the case $p \neq 0$ because $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}) \not \cong \mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_p)$. But $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{F}_p) \cong \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ for any prime $p$. So we can't distinguish $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ from $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ for different primes $p \neq l$ in such a simple-minded way. So for the rest of this post, let $p,l$ be distinct primes. The next guess is that maybe we can distinguish $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ from $\mathrm{ACF}_l$ by seeing that $\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}) \not \cong \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_l(t)})$. To this end, note that there is a tower $\mathbb{F}_p \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p}(t) \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}$. The automorphism groups of these intermediate extensions are respectively $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$, $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$, and a free profinite group (the last one is according to wikipedia ). From (3), there is at least a subquotient $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$ which looks different for different primes. But I don't see how to turn this observation into a proof that $\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p(t)}) \not \cong \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_l(t)})$ specifically, or that $\mathrm{ACF}_p \not \simeq \mathrm{ACF}_l$ more generally. Note that if we change ""algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$"" to ""fields of characteristic $p$"", then its easy to distinguish these categories because their subcategories of finite fields look very different. Also, there is a natural topological enrichment of $\mathrm{ACF}_p$ where one gives the homset the topology of pointwise convergence. I'd be interested to hear of a way to distinguish these topologically-enriched categories.","['galois-theory', 'number-theory', 'positive-characteristic', 'category-theory', 'field-theory']"

So please assume very limited understanding of measure theory. If at all possible an answer in plain English would be ideal.] A probability space is defined as the triple ($\Omega,\mathcal{F},P$). The sample space and the sigma-algebra of events of a probability space -($\Omega,\mathcal{F}$)- would seem to fulfill the conditions of a topological space , ($X,\tau$): There is always a null event ($P(\{\emptyset\} = 0)$) and a certain event ($P(\{\Omega\})=1$). This corresponds to the condition, ""The empty set and $X$ itself belong to $\tau$"" in a topology sapce. Any union of events belongs to $\mathcal{F}$ (closed under countable unions).

The obvious problem is: if $f$ were not a bijection this would make no sense. This definition, thus, works just when $f$ is a invertible. Now, it is quite obvious that this is too restrictive. In this framework it is not possible, for example, to prove that: $$\delta \circ f = \sum_i \dfrac{1}{f'(x_i)}\delta_{x_i},$$ where $x_i$ are the zeroes of $f$ and $\delta_{x_i}$ is the delta centered at $x_i$ . With the presented definition $\delta \circ f$ makes no sense, because $f$ is not injective since $\# f^{-1}(0)> 1$ . This property is, though, well-known and true. In that sense, how should we correctly define the composition of distribution and a $C^\infty$ function? What is the correct definition which allows us to tackle cases in which the function is not injective?","['distribution-theory', 'function-and-relation-composition', 'functional-analysis', 'dirac-delta', 'definition']"

Let us call $(m,n)$ a math.se pair if the prime factors of $m$ are the same as those of $n$ and the prime factors of $m+1$ are the same as those of $n+1$, e.g. $(2,8)$. For every $s\geq 2$, the pair $((2^s-2),2^s(2^s-2))$ is such a pair (for $s=2$ we have the previous pair). The question I asked myself was: are there other math.se pairs, i.e., math.se pairs not of the form $((2^s-2),2^s(2^s-2))$? So, I made a fortran program that verifies if $(i,j)$ is a math.se pair for $1<i<j$ and for $1<i\leq m$ and $m<j\leq n$ where $m$ and $n$ are input values, but the only different math.se pair that I (actually, it was the computer) found is $(75,1215)$ (we have that $75=3\cdot5^2$, $1215=3^5\cdot 5$, $76=2^2\cdot19$ and $1216=2^6\cdot19$). The problem is that the greater $i$ or $j$ is, the greater is the time the computer takes. Now I wonder if that $(75,1215)$ is the only math.se pair not of the form $((2^s-2),2^s(2^s-2))$. If there are others, are there infinitely many of them? If yes, can we list them all? If you look carefully, you'll see that $(a_s+1)^2=b_s+1$, where $a_s=2^s-2$ and $b_s=2^s(2^s-2)$. With this in mind, I tried to obtain a math.se pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies $(a+1)^3=b+1$. In this case, we need to find a number $b$, such that $b=a^3+3a^2+3a$ and such that $b$ and $a$ have the same prime factors.

a = \frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{a_2}{2^2} + \ldots  \qquad (a_i=0,1).

Let $N = \nu_{5,5} - 1$.
I've made an argument using the dimensions of the fibers of $\Gamma = \{(F,\ell) \in \mathbb{P}^N \times \text{Gr}(2,5)\mid \ell \subseteq V(F)\}$ over $\mathbb{P^N}$ and $\text{Gr}(2,5)$ which reduces the problem to finding a single quintic hypersurface which contains only finitely many lines, at which point I find I'm stuck. My thought process has been as follows: A similar argument reduces the problem of showing that every cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ contains a line to that of finding such a cubic surface which contains finitely many lines. At this point some case analysis shows that the surface given in affine coordinates $T_1T_2T_3 = 1$ can only contain lines at infinity, and that any such line is the intersection of a coordinate plane with the plane at infinity. This lower-dimensional example doesn't seem to generalize immediately, and all of the examples I've tried have either failed to be examples, or the case analysis in enumerating the lines on a particular surface has grown very unwieldy. Here are some attempts I've tried: Obvious reducible quintics like $x_0^5$ or $x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4$ don't work since they contain hyperplanes. $x_0^5 + x_1^5 + x_2^5 + x_3^5 + x_4^5$ contains infinitely many lines.

This isn't an explicit example, but an idea for generating one that I don't know how to concretize. Let $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^3 \subset \mathbb{P}^4$ be a surface (possibly of degree less than 5) which contains only finitely many lines. Taking the cone over $Y$ in $\mathbb{P}^4$ won't work, but maybe we could somehow take a ""twisted"" version of a cone over $Y$ in $\mathbb{P}^4$ to obtain a quintic hypersurface, without adding too many new lines.

1720137,Proof of the Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem,"I'm stuck on a particular line of the proof of The Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem. In lectures, we have: $1.$ Defined equicontinuous as: Let $X$ be a metric space, $C(X) = \{f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\text{ continuous} \}$ the space of continuous functions, $S \subset C(X)$ .
Let $x \in X$ be a point. Then $S$ is equicontinuous at $x$ if $\forall \varepsilon > 0$ , $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $y \in B(x, \delta)$ , $f \in S$ $\implies$ $|f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon$ . And obviously $S$ is equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at all points of $X$ . $2.$ Stated The Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem as: Suppose that $X$ is a compact metric space and $S \subset C(X)$ is a subspace. Then, $S$ is compact $\iff$ $S$ is closed, bounded, and equicontinuous. In the proof of the forward direction: Closed and bounded are clear, so it remains to show that $S$ is equicontinuous. We already know that $S$ is totally bounded, so let $\varepsilon > 0$ and fix $x \in X$ . Then $\exists F \subset S$ finite such that $S \subset \bigcup_{f \in F}B(f, \frac{\varepsilon}{3})$ . Since $F$ is equicontinuous... This is the line that I get stuck at, why is $F$ equicontinuous?","['metric-spaces', 'compactness', 'analysis', 'proof-explanation']"

What is the best way to calculate the Christoffel symbols? Is it using either of these sets of equations or is there another way?

1720474,Hartshorne 4.1.6 Gonality of a curve,"I have a question about the following exercise from Hartshorne's book 'Algebraic geometry': Let $X$ be a curve of genus $g$. Show that there is a finite morphism $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb P^1$ with degree $\leq g+1$. My idea is the following: We choose $g+1$ points $P_i$ in $X$. This gives us by a previous exercise (4.1.2) a rational function $r=\frac g h$ with poles at the $P_i$ and nowhere else. Now we define the map on closed points to be $x \mapsto [h(x):g(x)]$. As this map is non-constant, it is finite. The fibre of $f^{-1}([1:0] )$ contains exactly the $P_i$ and hence the degree of $f$ is smaller than g+1. What obstructs us from choosing less than g+1 points in the beginning? Sincerely slin0",['algebraic-geometry']
1720475,Proving that Levi-Civita connection is preserved by isometries,"I am trying to prove that given two Riemannian submanifolds $S,S'$ with Levi-Civita connections $\nabla , \nabla'$ and an isometry $f$, then 
$$
Df(\nabla_XY)=\nabla'_{X'}Y'
$$
where, $X',Y'=Df(X),Df(Y)$.
The argument is that if $\nabla''_XY=D f^{-1}(\nabla '_{X'}Y')$ torsion free and metric then it is the Levi-Civita connection on $S$. I was trying to prove this is metric and this is what I get: 
$$
g(\nabla''_XY,Z)+g(Y,\nabla''_XZ)=g(D f^{-1}(\nabla '_{X'}Y'),Z)+g(Y,D f^{-1}(\nabla '_{X'}Z'))
$$
$$
=g'(\nabla '_{X'}Y',Z)+g'(Y',\nabla '_{X'}Z')
$$
as $f$ is isometry, and as $\nabla'$ is Levi-Civita,
$$
=X'g'(Y',Z')=X'g(Y,Z)

which should have been $Xg(Y,Z)$... Can someone explain what I am doing wrong? also is there a more efficient way to show what I want to prove instead of checking that $\nabla''$ is metric and torsion free (and also that it is a connection)?

Now, if $F$ is a field, I can prove easily that $F(x)\subseteq F((x))$ but I'm having problems to show this is a proper inclusion. If for example $F=\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$, I can take a well-known function, say $\cos x$ and use its power series to show proper inclusing, because if $$\left(F((x))\ni\right)\;\cos x=1-\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\in F(x)$$ then, since $f(x),g(x)\in F[x]$ (polynomials), we'd get that $\cos x$ has a finite number of zeros, which is absurd, and thus $\cos x\in F((x))\setminus F(x)$.
