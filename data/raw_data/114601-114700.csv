1675382,Can this be proven like this? (Limit Theory),"I had this question in mind when I was revisiting my earlier question: Getting stuck on an Analysis Question - Limit Theory . Now that I know $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{X_1\cdot X_2\cdot \cdot \cdot X_n} = a$ if $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}X_n = a$ and $X_n > 0, a>0$. I want to see if it is okay to prove this proposition if $a=0$. My intuitive idea is this: For all positive $\epsilon$, there is some $N$, if $n \geq N, |x_n|< \epsilon$. Thus, somehow (though I don't know how to work out the details), $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{X_N\cdot X_{N+1}\cdot \cdot \cdot X_n} < \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \epsilon^{\frac{n-N+1}{n}} = \epsilon$ And the previous terms ${X_1\cdot X_2\cdot \cdot \cdot X_{N-1}}$ are real. Hence, we can say $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{X_1\cdot X_2\cdot \cdot \cdot X_{N-1}} = 1$. Thus, establishing specific $N_1$ and $N_2$ respectively, can we conclude that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{X_1\cdot X_2\cdot \cdot \cdot X_n} = 0 < \epsilon$ ?

1675402,What's the benefit of using strong induction when it's replaceable by weak induction?,"Example of a proof of a theorem using weak(ordinary) induction The two types of inductions have process of proving P(a) and ""for all integers $n \ge b, P(n)$"" as a result in common.

1675405,proof - Bézout Coefficients are always relatively prime,"I had been researching over the Extended Euclidean Algorithm when I happened to observe that the Bézout Coefficients were always relatively prime. Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers and $d$ their GCD. Now, $d = ax + by$ where x and y are two integers. $$d = ax + by \implies 1 = \frac{a}{d}x + \frac{b}{d}y$$ So, $x$ and $y$ can be expressed to form 1 so their GCD is 1 and are relatively prime. ($\frac{a}{d}$ and $\frac{b}{d}$ are integers.) Another great thing is that $\frac{a}{d}$ and $\frac{b}{d}$ are also relatively prime. So you see this goes on like a sequence till $a$ and $b$ become one. Am I right? What else can be known from this fact? Is it useful? Can it be used to prove some other things?","['number-theory', 'proof-verification', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1675485,Are there arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive primes? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : I'm trying to find the longest consecutive set of composite numbers (6 answers) Closed 6 years ago . I made a program to find out the number of primes within a certain range, for example between $1$ and $10000$ I found $1229$ primes, I then increased my range to $20000$ and then I found $2262$ primes, after doing it for $1$ to $30000$, I found $3245$ primes. Now a curious thing to notice is that each time, The probability of finding a prime in between $2$ multiples of $10000$ is decreasing, i.e it was $$\frac{2262-1229}{10000}=0.1033$$ between $10000$ and $20000$, and $$\frac{3245-2262}{10000}=0.0983$$ between $20000$ and $30000$, So from this can we infer that there will exist two numbers separated by a gap of $10000$ such that no number in between them is prime? If so how to determine the first two numbers with which this happens? Also I took $10000$ just as a reference here, what about if the gap between them in general is $x$, can we do something for this in generality?

1675487,A differentiation under the integral sign,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function Lebesgue summable on all $\mu$-measurable and bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\mu$ is the usual Lebesgue measure defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be a function of class $C^k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ whose support is contained in the compact subset $V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. That implies that all the derivatives of $g$, up to the $k$-th, are bounded and supported within $V$. I suspect that these conditions are enough to guarantee that the function $$h(\boldsymbol{x}):=\int_V f(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{x})g(\boldsymbol{y})\,d\mu_{\boldsymbol{y}}$$is of class $C^k(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In fact, I notice, if I am not wrong, that $$h(\boldsymbol{x})=\int_{V-\boldsymbol{x}} f(\boldsymbol{y})\bar{g}(\boldsymbol{y}+\boldsymbol{x})\,d\mu_{\boldsymbol{y}}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(\boldsymbol{y})\bar{g}(\boldsymbol{y}+\boldsymbol{x})\,d\mu_{\boldsymbol{y}}$$where $$\bar{g}(\boldsymbol{y}) := \begin{cases} g(\boldsymbol{y}), & \boldsymbol{y}\in V \\ 0, & \boldsymbol{y}\in\mathbb{R}^n\setminus V \end{cases}$$and $V-\boldsymbol{x}=\{\boldsymbol{y}\in\mathbb{R}^n:\boldsymbol{y}+\boldsymbol{x}\in V\}$, and I suppose that the conditions on $g$ may be enough to allow us to differentiate under the integral sign. Is my intuition that $h\in C^k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ correct and, if it is, how can we prove it? A trial of mine : I know a corollary of Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem that - if $f:V\times [a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$, $(\boldsymbol{x},t)\mapsto f(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ with $V$ measurable is such that $\forall t\in[a,b]\quad f(-,t)\in L^1(V)$, i.e. the function $\boldsymbol{x}\mapsto  f(\boldsymbol{x},t) $ is Lebesgue summable on $V$, - and if there is a neighbourhood $B(t_0,\delta)$ of $t_0$ such that, for almost all $\boldsymbol{x}\in V$ and for all $t\in B(t_0,\delta)$, $\left|\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x},t)}{\partial t}\right|\le\varphi(\boldsymbol{x})$, where $\varphi\in L^1(V) $, then
$$\frac{d}{dt}\int_V f(\boldsymbol{x},t) d\mu_{\boldsymbol{x}}\bigg|_{t=t_0}=\int_V\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x},t_0)}{\partial t}d\mu_{\boldsymbol{x}}$$but I am not able to find a proper $\varphi$ to use in this context.

1675558,In which sense is the Fourier transform the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform? A mathematical point of view.,"I try to understand in which sense the Fourier transform is the continuous analogue of the discrete Fourier transform . I know, there are many books and many questions on this site concerning this topic, but almost all of them are written from an engineer's point of view. I'm a mathematician, and as such, I'm not familiar with the application of Fourier analysis in engineering. So, I would like to handle the following objects as mathematical objects without any physical interpretation. Let me first introduce the relevant objects: Let $n\in\mathbb N$ and $\omega\in\mathbb C$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity. It's easy to verify that the columns of $$\tilde V_\omega:=\frac 1{\sqrt n}\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \omega^{0\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{0\cdot (n-1)}\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\\omega^{(n-1)\cdot 0}&\cdots&\omega^{(n-1)\cdot (n-1)} \end{pmatrix}}_{=:V_\omega}$$ are an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb C^n$. Now, $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega:\mathbb C^n\to\mathbb C^n\;,\;\;\;z\mapsto\left(f_z\left(\omega^0\right),\ldots,f_z\left(\omega^{n-1}\right)\right)^T$$ with $$f_z(w):=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}z_kw^k\;\;\;\text{for }z=\left(z_0,\ldots,z_{n-1}\right)^T\text{ and }w\in\mathbb C$$ is called discrete Fourier transform . Again, it's easy to verify that $V_\omega$ is the transformation matrix of $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$, i.e. $$\operatorname{DFT}_\omega z=V_\omega z\color{blue}{\stackrel{\text{def}}=\sqrt n\tilde V_\omega z}\;\;\;\text{for all }z\in\mathbb C^n\;,$$ and is invertible with $$V_\omega^{-1}=\frac 1nV_{\omega^{-1}}$$ and hence $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$ is an isomorphism. We can easily prove that $$\langle\operatorname{DFT}_\omega z,\operatorname{DFT}_\omega w\rangle=n\langle z,w\rangle\;\;\;\text{for all }z,w\in\mathbb C^n$$ (using that $\tilde V_\omega$ is unitary). Now, let $a,b\in\mathbb R$ with $a<b$ and $D:=(a,b)$. It's a well-known fact that $$\phi_k(x):=\frac 1{\sqrt{b-a}}e^{2\pi{\rm i}\frac k{b-a}x}\;\;\;\text{for }k\in\mathbb Z\text{ and }x\in D$$ is an orthonormal basis of $L^2(D;\mathbb C)$ and hence $$u=\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\underbrace{\langle u,\phi_k\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}}_{=:u_k}\phi_k\;\;\;\text{for all }u\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)\;.$$ Now, $$\sqrt{b-a}\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\tilde u_k\phi_k$$ with $$\tilde u_k:=\frac 1{\sqrt{b-a}}u_k\;\;\;\text{for }k\in\mathbb Z$$ is called Fourier series of $u\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)$. Let $$\mathcal F:L^2(D;\mathbb C)\to L^2(\mathbb Z;\mathbb C)\;,\;\;\;u\mapsto(\tilde u_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}\;.$$ We can show that $$\langle\mathcal Fu,\mathcal Fv\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}=(b-a)\langle(\tilde u_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z},(\tilde v_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb Z;\mathbb C)}\;\;\;\text{for all }u,v\in L^2(D;\mathbb C)\;.$$ Is $\mathcal F$ what we call the Fourier transform ? How are $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$ and $\mathcal F$ related? I would like to conclude that the discrete Fourier transform is an isomorphic isometry $(\mathbb C^n,\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle)\to(\mathbb C^n,n\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle)$ and that an analogue statement holds true for the Fourier transform on $(L^2(D;\mathbb C),\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)})$. Please keep this in mind, when you formulate an answer. I suppose $\mathcal F$ is not the mapping I'm looking for, cause its nature seems to be different $\operatorname{DFT}_\omega$. I guess the mapping should be $(L^2(D;\mathbb C)\to (L^2(D;\mathbb C)$ where the image is equipped with an inner product of the form $c\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_{L^2(D;\mathbb C)}$ for some $c\in\mathbb C$.","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'lp-spaces', 'discrete-mathematics']"

So far, so good. The random variable $X$ can produce different numbers, and if it produces (say) $0.5$ with probability $0.25$, then $p_X(0.5)=0.25$. I start to fall to pieces a little latter, when the author begins to write things like $p_X(X)$. I'm not sure how to read this notation. It seems to be saying that the random variable has itself as an output? The author goes on to write: There is nothing wrong mathematically here with having a random variable $X$ as the argument to the density function $p_X$, though this expression may seem self-referential at first. And later, when introducing the same notation again: It may seem strange at first glance that $X$, the argument of the probability mass function $p_X$ is itself a random variable, but this type of expression is perfectly well-defined mathematically.

1676548,Help With a Card Game,"Intro A friend of mine is trying to create a real time card game where players try to match images on cards in their hand to another card that is in play. Example: Player 1 plays a card with images {a, b, c}. Another player could play a card with any of a, b, or c on it. That is {a, d, e}, {b, d, e}, {c, d, e} all match at exactly one of the images on the card in play ({a, b, c}). We're trying to understand how to setup this game such that: 1) Each card with N images is guaranteed to match at least N other cards (no orphaned images). Example: the card {a, b, c} would match at least 3 other cards. One for each of a, b, and c. 2) No two cards match in more than one way. Example {a, b, c} and {a, b, d} cannot exist in the deck as both {a, b} match these two cards. At most one image should match (just {a}, just {b}, or just {c}). 3) In reality we'd like to have 8 images per card and have a deck of at least 50 cards. So instead of cards that look like {a, b, c}, we'd really have cards with 8 images and they'd look something like {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}. Question 1) How many images will we need to create to support this scheme? I've looked into building the deck as a collection of fully connected graphs which would ensure that each images on every card is ""connected"" to another unique card, but the number images needed grows quite quickly. Example: To get a set of cards with 8 images on it, I see 9 vertices (cards) in a fully connected graph which requires no less than 36 images (just for 9 cards!). This is K9 in the fully connected graph link. 2) Is there some type of pseudocode or algorithm to help us build this out programatically? Ideally we'd like to adjust it so that we can affect the probability of matches. Example: In the fully connected graph scheme, each card matches every other card (which means you can always just play whatever is in your hand). We'd ideally like a scheme where every card matches something like 1/3 or 1/4 of the deck's card population so that there's some degree of skill involved. It would be nice if the algorithm/pseudocode allowed us to affect the probability of cards matching. Can someone help me understand this problem from at math perspective?

In how many ways can they be arranged in a row such that the two ends are occupied by boys and no two girls are seated together? The answer is  $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 7!$ and the book gave the same explanation is the same as the one here .  This was my analysis.  Can you explain why it's wrong? There are $7 \cdot 6$ ways to fill the first and the last slot.  If we ignore the rules for a moment, there are $8!$ ways to fill the remaining slots. Any time we have two girls together is unacceptable.  So, we can count the two girls as one person.  This gives us $7!$ unacceptable arrangements before considering the different choices in the two-girl spot. Since there are $3 \cdot 2$ ways to fill the two-girl spots, we have $6 \cdot 7!$ unacceptable arrangements in the middle. It follows that there are $2 \cdot 7!$ acceptable arrangements in the middle, and $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 2 \cdot 7!$ ways to fill the spots according the the rules.

Here's a $3$-bit Gray code, where the strings are written as columns: $00001111$ $00111100$ $01100110$ A single-track Gray code has the property that each row is identical up to offsets (i.e., cyclical shifts). It is impossible for such a code to run through all $2^n$ strings, so this condition is relaxed. Here's a $5$-bit single-track Gray code, with red zeroes showing the offsets: $\color{red}00000001110001111111$ $1111\color{red}0000000111000111$ $01111111\color{red}000000011100$ $110001111111\color{red}00000001$ $0001110001111111\color{red}0000$ Note that the above code is not maximal in the sense that it only runs through $20$ words, while it is possible for a $5$-bit single-track Gray code to run through up to $30$ words.

1676754,How is the smoothness of the space of deformations related to unobstructedness?,"As a beginning differential geometer, I've been trying to learn about deformation theory.  Other than Kodaira's book , I've found virtually no references from the point of view of differential geometry.  As such, my understanding is hazy. I am asking this question in an attempt to clarify my vague understanding, especially in regard to the last bullet point below.  Precise definitions of terms are welcome, as are references to books or introductory papers on the subject. My vague understanding goes like this: We are interested in studying the ""deformations"" of a geometric object $X$ (e.g., a complex manifold $X$).  We can associate to $X$ its ""deformation exact sequence,"" which amounts to a kernel-cokernel exact sequence in some cohomology theory (e.g., Cech cohomology) of some map $\varphi$ which I don't understand:
$$0 \to \text{Ker}(\varphi_*) \to H^1_X \xrightarrow{\varphi_*} H^2_X \to \text{Coker}(\varphi_*) \to 0.$$
We interpret this as follows: $\text{Ker}(\varphi_*)$ is the space of infinitesimal (or ""first-order"") deformations.  An object $X$ is rigid iff $X$ has no infinitesimal deformations -- i.e., $\text{Ker}(\varphi_*) = 0$. $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*)$ is the space of infinitesimal (or ""first-order"") obstructions.  An object $X$ is unobstructed iff $X$ has no obstructions -- i.e, $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*) = 0$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the ""moduli space of local deformations of $X$.""  The ""formal tangent space"" $T_X\mathcal{M}$ is the space of first-order deformations -- i.e., $T_X\mathcal{M} \cong \text{Ker}(\varphi_*)$. Somehow , in some cases, the smoothness of $\mathcal{M}$ is related to whether $X$ is unobstructed.  In this case, $\dim(\mathcal{M}) = \dim(T_X\mathcal{M}) = \dim(\text{Ker}(\varphi_*))$. More hazy thoughts: I think in the cases I'm interested in, the map $\varphi_*$ can be regarded as the differential of some map $\varphi \colon \text{Somewhere} \to \text{Somewhere Else}$, and $\mathcal{M} = \varphi^{-1}(\text{point})$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is smooth if $\varphi$ is a submersion (meaning $\varphi_*$ is surjective, so $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*) = 0$), in which case $T_X\mathcal{M} = \text{Ker}(\varphi_*)$.  How any of this works precisely, I don't know.","['complex-geometry', 'deformation-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Lets set then $n$ to 32 for example: Question How can the the radius $r_m$ ($m=1,2,3...$) of the $m$th red circle be calculated for a polygon with $n$ sides inside the imagined circle of radius $R$? (Is there a Formula or expressions to be used?) Thanks JeanMarie for answering this question: $$ r_m= 2R \ \cos{( \frac{m}{n}\pi )}$$","['circles', 'trigonometry', 'polygons']"
1676878,Constructing a $4$-state Markov chain model that describes the arrival of customers,"The times between successive customer arrivals at a facility are independent and identically distributed random variables with the following PMF: $$p(k) = 0.2(k = 1)$$ $$p(k) = 0.3(k = 3)$$ $$p(k) = 0.5(k = 4)$$ $$p(k) = 0(k \notin \{1,3,4\})$$ Construct a four-state Markov chain model that describes the arrival process. In this model, one of the states should correspond to the times when an arrival occurs. Can you please explain in simple words how to construct this markov chain?

1676879,Game-winning strategy,"Player A and Player B are playing a turn-based game. At the beginning of the game there are $N(N \ge 3)$ points in a plane. In each turn one of the players chooses exactly $3$ different points and he connects them with a closed curve line (He can leave as many points as he wants inside/outside of the closed curve). The only other restriction of the game is that none of the line should intersect or touch each other (Therefore you can't choose a point that's already lying on a curve).  After finite number of moves it's not possible to choose $3$ different points without violating the rules, hence the game ends. The player who drew a closed curve last is the winner. For which $N$ Player A can be sure that he will win, no matter how Player B plays? I've managed to partially solve this problem, as I have proved that for every odd number, the Player A can always win the game. The strategy is to choose $3$ random points and connect them with a closed curve such that the number of point encircled by the curve is the same as the number of line outside of the curve. After that in each turn Player A repeats what Player B does, so because of the symmetry he's garanteed to finish last and hence win. On the other hand this strategy doesn't work for even numbers. By brute-force and checking every possible game situation, I found out that Player A can't win when $N=8,14,20$ (I did this up to 20, as the calculations get more complicated as the number of points grows). This makes me conjecture that Player A can't win when $N=6k+2$, unless Player B makes a mistake. On each turn the dots are split into two new ""disjoint"" sets. Actually after $K$ turns we have $K+1$ ""disjoint"" sets, albeit some of them can be empty. This sets of point can be treated as separate games, but the problem is that sometimes is better to lose in some of those separate games, in order to win in the last one.","['game-theory', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"
1676890,Every inverse semigroup is a group,"The Wikipedia page about inverse semigroups defines them as follows: In mathematics, an inverse semigroup (occasionally called an inversion  semigroup) $S$ is a semigroup in which every element $x$ in $S$ has a unique inverse $y$ in $S$ in the sense that $x = xyx$ and $y = yxy$. There is a question on this site ( A semigroup $X$ is a group iff for every $g\in X$, $\exists! x\in X$ such that $gxg = g$ ) whose answer is ""A nonempty semigroup $S$ is a group iff for every $x\in S$ there is a unique $y\in S$ such that $xyx=x$."" So it follows that every nonempty inverse semigroup is a group. It seems weird that this fact is not listed on Wikipedia, and that some literature seems to exist about inverse semigroups. Am I not understanding correctly the definitions?","['abstract-algebra', 'semigroups', 'group-theory']"

1676905,Poincaré duality for currents and non-closed forms,"In page 8 of Quantization of Higher Abelian Gauge Theory in Generalized Differential Cohomology by Szabo, the author claims that Poincaré  duality holds for non-closed forms as long as the other form (pairing with the former one) is distributional, i.e., it's a de Rham current. Let me be more precise. Let $X$ be a manifold of dimension $n$. Given a de Rham current of compact support $j_e \in H^m_{dR, c} (X)$ that is exact in $H^m_{dR} (X)$ (I don't think this exactness part is relevant, anyway …), the author claims that there exists a homology class $[W_e] \in H_{m - n} (X, \mathbb{R})$ such that $$\int_X a \wedge j_e = \int_{W_e} a$$ for every $a \in \Omega^{n - m} (X)$. This fact is indeed need in the paper I mentioned since in page 6 he uses this property (without mentioning it previously) to deduce Dirac charge quantization condition from $\exp (-\int_X A\wedge j_e) = \exp (-\int_{W_e} A)$ for possibly non-closed $A$.

(for $f\in L^1([0,1]),x\in E$ define $\phi_{f,x}(s)=f(s)x$ for all $s\in[0,1]$ then $\Phi(f\otimes x)=\phi_{f,x}$ is that isometric isomorphism) Now let $\omega:[0,1]\to(0,+\infty)$ be a continuous function such that $\omega(0)=1$ and $\omega(s+t)\leq\omega(s)\omega(t)$.Define

1676929,Nonzero solutions to $\mathbb E\left[e^{\theta X}\right] = 1$?,"Suppose $X$ is a random variable with $\mu=\mathbb E[X]\ne0$ and that $X$ has a finite moment generating function on some open interval containing $0$. Then for what $\theta\ne0$ does the following equation hold?
$$\mathbb E\left[e^{\theta X}\right] = 1. $$ The book I am reading ( Stochastic Processes by Ross) says ""We shall suppose that such a $\theta$ exists (and is usually unique)"" without justification. This statement does not seem obvious to me. For example, if $X$ has exponential distribution with mean $\mu$, then 
$$\mathbb E\left[e^{\theta X}\right] = \frac{\mu^{-1}}{\mu^{-1}-\theta}=1 $$
has only the solution $\theta=0$, while if $X\sim\mathcal N(\mu, \theta^2)$,
$$\mathbb E\left[e^{\theta X}\right] = e^{\mu\theta + \frac12\sigma^2\theta^2}=1,$$
has the solution $\theta = -\frac{2\mu}{\sigma^2}$. So under what conditions does this equation have nonzero solution(s)? Edit: The map $x\mapsto e^{\theta x}$ is convex, so Jensen's inequality yields
$$e^{\theta\mu}\leqslant\mathbb E[e^{\theta X}]=1 $$ and hence $\theta\mu<0$. This means $\theta$ and $\mu$ must have opposite signs.","['probability-theory', 'moment-generating-functions']"

otherwise, if $ m > n$ then we have $m - n$ elements left, and we have $2^{m-n} + 2^{n^m}$ relations. What do you guys think? Edit: check my solution","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1676947,Order type in finite sets,"This is a general question regarding power (cardinal number)  and type (ordinal number) of a set. These definitions are taken from Kolmogorov and Fomin(1970).

For instance, $\aleph_0$ corresponds to the usual order $\omega$ of $\mathbb{N}$ which is 
$$
1,2,3,\dots,
$$ 
but another order type can be written as 
$$
1,3,5,\dots,2,4,6\dots.

$$
1,2,,\dots,2n
$$
in which $2n$ is the maximal element. However, another order type
$$
1,3,5,\dots,2n-1,2n,\dots 2
