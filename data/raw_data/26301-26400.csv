241165,"What is a good algorithm to randomly determine the move order of a set of players given their ""speed"" values?","The context of this is that I am creating a turn-based RPG engine, and each of a set of players has a ""speed"", which determines the probability of moving earlier in a turn depending on how high it is. The higher the speed, the earlier in the turn the player is expected to move. I would like to devise an algorithm to determine a random probabilistic turn order based off of these speed values. The algorithm should have the following properties: It is commutative. That is, no matter which player is used as the base for calculations, the algorithm will return the same probability of each turn order occurring. It is consistent. The probabilities always add up to 1. It handles equality well. When all the players have the same speed, they should have an equal probability of moving first, second, etc. When two players have equal speed, but dominate over the rest, they will have an equal probability between themselves and everybody else will have a lesser amount. It is scalable. The same formula should work no matter how many players (even the degenerate case of one) there are. It is smooth. That is, it does not suddenly snap from one case to another. If we make the fastest player always move first, the probability of a player moving first snaps from 0 to 1 on the basis of a single point difference, which is bad. It preserves priority. That is, if the faster player does not move first, it should have a high probability of moving second, and if it doesn't, then it should have an even higher probability of moving third, etc. And a few properties that are less important: It is adjustable. Depending on how steep the user wants the increase in probability to be, there should be a parameter in the algorithm to account for it, without requiring a complete redesign of the algorithm. It handles edge cases well. If we let $s$ be a variable representing the speed of one of the players and $p(s)$ represent the probability that that player moves first, then $\displaystyle \lim_{s \rightarrow \infty} p(s) = 1$.","['statistics', 'probability']"

241170,Sheaf of germs of regular functions on an affine variety,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
Let $X$ be a Zariski closed subset of $k^n$.
Let $I(X) = \{f \in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]| f(p) = 0$ for every $p \in X\}$.
Let $A = k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I(X)$.
Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$.
Let $f\colon U \rightarrow k$ be a function.
We say $f$ is regular at a point $p$ of $U$ if there exist an open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ contained in $U$ and $g, h \in A$ such that $h$ does not vanish at every point of $V$ and $f(x) = g(x)/h(x)$ for every $x \in V$.
We say $f$ is regular on $U$ if $f$ is regular at every point of $U$.
Let $\Gamma(U)$ be the set of regular functions on $U$.
Clearly $U \rightarrow \Gamma(U)$ defines a sheaf $\mathcal{O}$ of rings on $X$.
How do we prove the following assertions? 1) Let $x \in X$. $\mathcal{O}_x$ is canonically isomorphic to $A_{m_x}$, where $m_x$ is the maximal ideal of $A$ corresponding to $x$. 2) Let $f \in A$. $\Gamma(D(f))$ is canonically isomorphic to $A_f$, where $D(f) = \{x \in X| f(x) \neq 0\}$.",['algebraic-geometry']
241175,"If $\sum a_n$ converges, and if {$b_n$} is monotonic and bounded, prove $\sum a_n b_n$ converge.","I proved this way: Since {$b_n$} is bounded, let $|b_n| \le \alpha$ and $\alpha$ is an upper bound. Since $\sum a_n$ converges, there exists N such that $|\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k| \le \frac{\epsilon}{\alpha}$ for every N $\le$ n,m. Then $|\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k \alpha| \le \epsilon$ for every N $\le$ n,m. Now, $|\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k b_k| \le |\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k \alpha| \le \epsilon$,
thus $\sum a_n b_n$ converges. But the professor said the last inequality is wrong. What is the problem? How to fix it?",['analysis']

We start by looking at $E_2$ considered as an elliptic curve defined over the field $K(E_1) = K(x_1, y_1)$.

$$b_n = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L}^{L} f(x) sin\frac{n \pi x}{L}dx$$ I noticed that the coefficients are calculated in terms of n, but are used in the general equation in terms of m.

241530,If $X$ is a topological separable space then every open set is a union of a countable number of open balls?,"I am studying some real analysis (I am in the part before defining
Borel's $\sigma$-algebra) and there is a reminder in my lecture notes
that states that if $X$ is a separable metric space then every open
set is a union of a countable number of open balls (where separable
is defined as having a countable dense subset). Can we remove the requirement that $X$ is metric ? To be honest,
I don't really know the proof even with requiring that $X$ is metric,
I guess that we move from any union to a countable union by using
somehow the fact that every open ball have an element in the dense
set, this is what also led me to believe that the claim doesn't have
much to do with $X$ being metric. So there are two questions here, is it true for any topological space

241534,"For open affine $U\subset$ affine $X$, why is $k[U]$ flat over $k[X]$?","This is a homework problem for me so please do not post a full solution. I would very much appreciate a hint to move me past the point at which I'm stuck. Here is my work so far: The setting is that $X$ is an affine algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $U$ is an open affine subvariety.  At first I thought that $k[U]$ would necessarily be a localization of $k[X]$ and then it would automatically be flat. Then I learned (e.g. see Hailong Dao's example here ) that this doesn't have to be so because a function on $k[U]$ could be locally a quotient of functions in $k[X]$ at every point of $U$ without being a quotient globally on all of $U$. However, flatness is a very local property, so this shouldn't be a terminal problem. At each point of $U$, $k[U]$ is a localization of $k[X]$. Here's what came out when I tried to make this thought precise: $k[U]$ is flat over $k[X]$ if $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ of $k[X]$. Now if $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponds to a point $p$ of $X$ that is in $U$, then $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}=k[X]_\mathfrak{m}=\mathcal{O}_{X,p}$. Since any ring is flat over itself, for $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponding to $p\in U$, we have what we need. This also seems to be the argument given by James Milne in his notes (see p. 146, footnote 1). However, I am unsatisfied.  To apply the theorem that flatness is local, I need to localize at every maximal ideal of the base ring, which in this case is $k[X]$.  I localized at all $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponding to $p\in U$; but what about the maximal ideals of $k[X]$ corresponding to points outside $U$? Is it obvious that $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ in these cases? I have gotten as far as trying to describe the rings $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ and $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ to myself in these cases. $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is functions regular on $U$ divided by functions nonzero at $p\notin U$. $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ is functions regular on all of $X$ divided by functions nonzero at $p$. This can now be a smaller ring, so it is no longer any more clear to me that $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ than it was that $k[U]$ was flat over $k[X]$ in the first place. This is where I'm stuck. Further thoughts: although I haven't seen so far how to make this local proof work, the basic logic of working locally seems inescapable to me: after all, $k[U]$ consists of quotients of functions from $k[X]$. Shouldn't it be flat for ""essentially the same reason"" that localizations are flat? At any rate, a hint to push me past this stuck point would be much appreciated.

241591,Canonical field of Hilbert spaces in Dixmier; Plancherel Theorem,"I'm working through the proof of Plancherel's Theorem in $C^{*}$-algebras by Dixmier, section 18.8. For the most part, I'm happy with it, although I have one problem. From Dixmier, I have the proof that $$L^{2}(G)\cong\int_{\widehat{G}}^{\oplus}{(K(\pi)\otimes\overline{K}(\pi))\ d\mu(\pi)},$$ where $\pi\mapsto K(\pi)$ denotes the canonical field of Hilbert spaces. That is, if for $n\in\Bbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, we denote by $\widehat{G}_{n}$ the set of elements of dimension $N$ in $\widehat{G}$, then $\pi\mapsto K(\pi)$ reduces on $\widehat{G}_{n}$ to the standard $n$-dimensional Hilbert space. I got into reading this proof from Principles of Harmonic Analysis by Anton Deitmar, which gives the statement of the equivalent part of the Plancherel Theorem as $$L^{2}(G)\cong\int_{\widehat{G}}^{\oplus}{\mathrm{HS}(V_{\pi})\ d\mu(\pi)},$$ and says that the proof is in Dixmier. Then my question is, how does one see that these two are indeed equivalent? Clearly, it suffices to show that $$\mathrm{HS}(V_{\pi})\cong K(\pi)\otimes\overline{K}(\pi),$$ but I simply have no idea how to go about showing that. I suspect that I'm just being stupid and missing something which makes it particularly obvious, which probably stems from a lack of understanding of the canonical field of Hilbert spaces over $\widehat{G}$. I'm reasonably happy with the definition, but I don't really know how to make use of it here. The only real attempt I've been able to come up with is based on the idea of writing $\widehat{G}=\bigoplus\widehat{G}_{n}$, and then $$\int_{\widehat{G}}^{\oplus}{(K(\pi)\otimes\overline{K}(\pi))\ d\mu(\pi)}=\bigoplus_{i}\int_{\widehat{G}_{n}}^{\oplus}(K(\pi)\otimes\overline{K}(\pi))\ d\mu(\pi)=\bigoplus_{i}\int_{\widehat{G}_{n}}^{\oplus}{(H_{i}\otimes\overline{H_{i}})\ d\mu(\pi)},$$ where $H_{i}$ is the standard $n$-dimensional Hilbert space. I'm aware that for finite $n$, this is just $\Bbb{C}^{n}$, although I am at a complete loss as to what Dixmier means by it for $H_{\infty}$ (if he means anything by it, he might not intend for you to look at it this way...). Even ignoring that issue, I'm at a loss as to where I should go after that (if what I wrote is even true, I'm not convinced you can split up the direct integral into a direct sum of integrals the way I did).

So I think this fits all the criterion except that this is from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and I'm not sure if the function extends in this case.  ie it's not the derivative here that converges uniformly but rather the arclength so to speak.

We can think of $v$ as a $1$-form on $E$ with values on vertical vector fields, i.e. $v \in \Omega^1(E,VE)$. The connection $v$ does not give a globally define $1$-form on $M$ but for any local trivializaton $U_{\alpha} \subseteq M$, $v$ gives a $1$-form $v_{\alpha}\in \Omega^1(U_{\alpha}, TF)$ which is obtained by pulling back $v$ by a by a trivializing section. The collection of $v_{\alpha}$ do not agree on intersections and one can write a rule showing how these transform. I've heard that while the connection is only a locally defined $1$-form on the base with values on vertical vector fields the curvature of a connection is a globally defined $2$-form on the base with values on vertical vector fields. I would like some help in making this precise. Lets define curvature $K \in \Omega^2(E,VE)$  by $K(X,Y)=v[X-v(X),Y-v(Y)]$, i.e. the failure of the bracket in preserving horizontal vector fields.

$\begin{equation} ab \leq \frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2) \end{equation}$. My attempt So if $a=b=0$, then the inequality is trivially $0 \leq 0$ and we are ok. If $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, then the product on the right is less than zero, while the one on the right is greater than $0$, so the inequality holds. The problem that I am having is that if the numbers are the same sign, we have that both products will be positive and now we have to the show the inequality is true in this case. I tried making the following re-arrangement as a starting point $\begin{equation} \\ 2ab \leq (a^2 + b^2) \end{equation}$ But I am not really sure where to go from here. I've been staring at it for a while and I just can't seem to get anything out of it. I noticed that it looks rather similar to the law of cosines for theta equal to 90 degrees and $c = 0$, though that would be wierd indeed. Anyway that hasn't been talked about in the book yet so I don't think it matters. We have been introduced to the binomial theorem, difference of powers and geometric sum theorems, but I couldn't find any enlightenment from these.

 I guess that the answer is $19$: Consider the two regular hexagons placed so that the center of each is a corner of the other. My Trial : As like Dan, I will use the same notations. Consider the graph such that there exist ten vertices and edges between two vertices has length 1. Step 1 : The graph is connected. Proof : If not, we push a component to another component closely. So we can draw another edge. This completes the proof. Step 2 : Note that any such connected graph has the equality : 
  $v-e + f=1$ where $v$, $e$ and $f$ are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces respectively. So $10- e + f =1$ This implies that the maximum of $f$ gives the maximume of $e$. Consider the graph whose figure is the two regular hexagons placed so that the center of each is a corner of the other. Note that any vertex in the graph has degree $\geq 3$. This implies that the maximum of $f$ occurs.","['contest-math', 'graph-theory', 'planar-graphs', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'combinatorics']"
