What is the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms that $v$ generates? The definition of a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms that I'm using is the following: Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F : U \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow U$ a $C^{\infty}$ mapping. The family of mappings $f_t: U \rightarrow U$ , $f_t(x) = F(x, t)$

  map and $f_s \cdot f_t = f_{s+t}$

I want to prove that on the interval $x\in[0, \frac{1}{2A}]$, $f(x)$ has its maximum at $x=\frac{1}{2A}$. To prove that, I think we have two approaches. First, prove it directly. Second, prove that $f(x)$ is an increasing function  on the interval $x\in[0, \frac{1}{2A}]$. When $A=2$, we are able to take the second approach thanks to a user named egreg. Prove that $\sin{(\pi 2x)}\left(\,\csc{(\pi x)}+\csc{(\pi (0.5-x))}\,\right)$ is an increasing function Now could anybody prove it generally? I am not sure for any $A$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $x\in[0, \frac{1}{2A}]$ (maybe true?), but strongly believe the maximum is $f(\frac{1}{2A})$.

I know there are some strong theorems we could use here. Like the answer to one of hilbert's problems. I was hoping there was an elementary way to see it.

  Q(B|x) := P(f^{-1}(B)|x) \qquad \text{ for all }x\in X,B\in \b(Y).
$$
Does there exist a stochastic kernel $R:X\times Y \to \p(X)$ satisfying the following conditions: $R(f^{-1}(y)|x,y) = 1$ for $\alpha\otimes Q$-almost all $(x,y)\in X\times Y$, that is
$$
  \int_{X\times Y}R\left(\left.X\setminus f^{-1}(y)\right|x,y\right)\;Q(\d y|x)\;\alpha(\d y) = 0
$$ for all $A\in \b(X)$ and $\alpha$-almost all $x\in X$ it holds that
$$
  P(A|x) = \int_Y R(A|x,y)\; Q(\d y|x).
$$ The statement sounds very much related to the Disintegration theorem , however the current version is seemingly more general and I was not able to transform it as a special case of the original formulation. Regarding the assumptions on the measurable spaces involved. In the formulation I have linked the Radon spaces are required (I don't know whether each Borel space is Radon), whereas in ""Conditioning and Disintegration"" of Kallenberg (Ch. 5 in 1st ed., Ch.6 in 2nd ed.) the disintegration theorem only requires the existence of regular conditional distributions. As in my case everything shall only hold almost surely, I guess that the result I am looking for may hold for general measurable spaces just based on the existence of conditional expectation for general measurable spaces. Although I know that there exists a connection between the conditional expectation and the disintegration, I'm not sure whether it can help me here.","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

Let $a\in A$ . $f(a)\in{\rm im}~f$ , $f(a)\in A$ since $f$ is from $A$ to $A$ , $a-f(a) \in A$ since $A$ is a module. Consider $f(a-f(a))$ . Since $f$ is a module homomorphism, $$f(a-f(a))=f(a)-ff(a)=f(a)-f(a)=0,$$ therefore $a-f(a)\in\ker f$ . We have $a-f(a)\in\ker f$ and $f(a)\in{\rm im}~f$ . $$(a-f(a))+f(a)=a-f(a)+f(a)=a$$ So $a\in A$ can be written as the sum of an element in $\ker f$ and an element in ${\rm im}~f$ and since $\ker f$ and ${\rm im}~f$ are submodules of $A$ , we have $$A=\ker f+{\rm im}~f.$$ I was also able to show that the intersection of $\ker f$ and ${\rm im}~f$ is $\{0\}$ . I showed this proof to one of my senior and he said that what I actually did in my proof was show that $A$ is the Internal Direct Sum of $\ker f$ and ${\rm im}~f$ . Looking back at the problem, what is asked is to prove that $A$ is the External Direct Sum of $\ker f$ and ${\rm im}~f$ . I got the internal and external direct sum wrong but I understand them now. Now how would I go on proving the problem? Here are some of my questions/ideas: Since I'm trying to prove that $A$ is an external direct sum may I assume that $A=X\oplus Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are modules? Then try to prove that that $\ker f=X$ and ${\rm im}~f=Y$ ? Also, if $A$ is the external direct product of $\ker f$ and ${\rm im}~f$ then that means that an element in $A$ is of the form $(x,y)$ where $x\in\ker f$ and $y\in{\rm im}~f$ right? Does that mean that I have to define $f$ in $X$ and $Y$ ? Is it possible to salvage my proof above? When does the internal direct sum equal to the external direct sum? I know that it is always the case that the two are isomorphic. If I remember correctly in groups it is possible for the internal direct product and the external direct product to be equal.

567175,Definition Topological Space,"Consider the definition of a topological space: Topological Space: A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ such that $\emptyset,X \in \mathcal{T}$. The union of elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$. Then a topological space is the ordered pair $(X,\mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. When I introduce this idea to students, it is simple enough to motivate why this definition was selected using elementary Calculus concepts and the fact that Topology originally was supposed to generalize these ideas. It makes this definition more accessible to them. Of course, one can equally put the definition in terms of closed sets. However, I have been asked why this definition. Meaning, not why this definition
as compared to the closed set definition but rather why this definition works better than other possible definitions. Then the student asks what other definitions were tried and why did they fail so that the above definition was settled on. I've thought about this myself but I've never found a reference that talks about how this definition was the the one a mathematician would want compared to other possible definitions. I'd love to be able to have a good answer for students for this and to be able to include this in why the above definition is 'good'. Does anyone know of a historical explanation in any text or paper that discusses, if only briefly, other definitions that were originally tried? I have not been successful in finding such sources. Even thoughts on possible alternate definitions of a topology that turn out to be 'inferior' to the standard one with a brief explanation why would be acceptable in lieu of a source.","['general-topology', 'math-history', 'reference-request']"

If I'm not mistaken it holds for the Riemannian connection. Okay, let $X =X^k e_k$, then
$$
   \nabla_i (X^k e_k) = \frac{\partial X^k}{\partial x^i}e_k+X^j \Gamma^k_{ij} e_k,  \\
    \operatorname{div} X= \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^i}+X^j \Gamma^i_{ij}, \\
    \Gamma^i_{ij} = \frac 1 2 g^{ik}(\partial_i g_{kj} + \partial_j g_{ki} - \partial_k g_{ij}).
$$
On the other hand 
$$
    X^\flat = g_{ij}X^j \theta^i, \\
    \nabla_k X^\flat = g_{ij} \nabla_k (X^j \theta^i) = g_{ij} \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^k} \theta^i - g_{sj}X^j \Gamma^s_{ki} \theta^i, \\
    \delta X^\flat=-g^{ki}\left( g_{ij} \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^k} - g_{sj}X^j \Gamma^s_{ki} \right) = -\frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^i} + g^{ki}g_{sj} X^j \Gamma^s_{ki}.
$$
We can see that $\operatorname{div} X = -\delta X^\flat$ holds iff 
$$
   X^j \Gamma^i_{ij} = -g^{ki}g_{sj}X^j \Gamma^s_{ki}.
$$
Now recall that
$$
   \Gamma^s_{ki} = \frac 1 2 g^{ls}( \partial_{k} g_{li}+\partial_i g_{lk} - \partial_l g_{ki}), \\
    g_{sj}\Gamma^s_{ki}=\frac 1 2 (\partial_k g_{ji}+\partial_i g_{jk}-\partial_j g_{ki}), \\
   g^{ki}g_{sj}\Gamma^s_{ki} = \frac 1 2 g^{ki}(\partial_k g_{ji}+\partial_i g_{jk}-\partial_j g_{ki}).
$$
Hence the equality $\operatorname{div} X = -\delta X^\flat$ holds if
$$
g^{ik}(\partial_i g_{kj} + \partial_j g_{ki} - \partial_k g_{ij}) = g^{ik}(-\partial_k g_{ji}-\partial_i g_{jk}+\partial_j g_{ki}), \\
   g^{ik} \partial_i g_{kj} = -g^{ik} \partial_i g_{jk}.

567479,Question about proof of Morse Lemma,"I am working on a problem for my differential geometry course. We are proving the following special case of the Morse lemma: Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be open and containing the origin $\mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (denote coordinates on $U$ by $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ ). Suppose we have smooth $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ , $f(\mathbf{0}) = 0$ , with $\mathbf{0}$ a nondegenerate critical point of $f$ of index $1 \le \lambda \le n$ . That is, we know that: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{0}) = 0$ , all $i$ . The Hessian matrix $\left[ \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left(\mathbf{0}\right)\right]$ is nonsingular. $\left[ \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left(\mathbf{0}\right)\right]$ has $\lambda$ negative eigenvalues and $n - \lambda$ positive eigenvalues. By transforming coordinates in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{0}$ to $y = (y_1, \dots ,y_n)$ , prove that we can write: $$f(y) = - \sum_1^\lambda (y_i)^2 + \sum_{\lambda + 1}^n (y_i)^2$$ Here is what I have so far. Because $f(\mathbf{0}) = 0$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{0}) = 0$ , all $i$ , I know from a previous result in class that I am able to write $$f(x) = \frac{1}{2} (x_1, \dots , x_n) \left[ \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left(\mathbf{0}\right)\right] (x_1, \dots, x_n)^T$$ in a sufficiently small spherical neighborhood $B$ of $\mathbf{0}$ ( $B \subseteq U$ ). Then I can take the Hessian $\left[ \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left(\mathbf{0}\right)\right]$ and rewrite it in it's eigendecomposition $$\left[ \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \left(\mathbf{0}\right)\right] = Q^T \Lambda Q.$$ Here, $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with the first $\lambda$ diagonal entries being the negative eigenvalues of the Hessian, and the last $n - \lambda$ diagonal values being the positive eigenvalues. So it seems like I am getting close to finishing the proof, except $Q(x_1, \dots, x_n)^T$ is not quite the coordinate transformation I need.
