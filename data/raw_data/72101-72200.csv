884691,When is every open set a $F_\sigma$?,"My question concerns the $F_\sigma$ property of a topological space $X$. I want to know if there is a particular name for those spaces in which every open set is $F_\sigma$. Moreover, if $X$ is a metric space the the above property is true, however, what happens if we ask less regularity from the space? Myabe only the axioms of countability can guarantee it? Also, any reference on the subject is appreciated.","['general-topology', 'reference-request']"

884794,The Taylor expansion of the metric at the origin in geodesic coordinates,"It is well known that in geodesic coordinates we have
$$
g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}-\frac{1}{3}\sum_{k,l}R_{ijkl}x^{k}x^{l}+O(|x|^{3})
$$
I have been trying to find a rigorous proof of it, but I cannot find a readable proof online ( see this one , for example) or derive it myself. From the compatibility with metric we have
$$
\partial_{i}g_{jk}=\sum_{\alpha}(\Gamma^{\alpha}_{ij}g_{ak}+\Gamma^{\alpha}_{ik}g_{aj})
$$
Since we know that $\nabla_{X}X=0$ for any vector from the origin, we have $\nabla_{i}\partial_{j}=0,\forall i,j$. This then implies all $\Gamma^{k}_{ij}=0$. So the first order derivative vanishes. However, it is not clear to me how to compute the second derivative. We have:
$$
\partial_{l}\partial_{i}g_{jk}=\sum_{\alpha}(\partial_{l}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{ij}g_{\alpha k}+\partial_{l}\Gamma^{\alpha}_{ik}g_{\alpha j})
$$
This can be simplified further by noticing that in the origin we have $g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$. Therefore the above sum is in fact
$$
\partial_{l}\partial_{i}g_{jk}=\partial_{l}\Gamma^{k}_{ij}+\partial_{l}\Gamma^{j}_{ik}
$$
And we would have proved the statement if we can show that
$$
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{l}\Gamma^{k}_{ij}+\partial_{l}\Gamma^{j}_{ik})=-\frac{1}{3}(R_{ijkl}+R_{ljki})
$$
By definition we have
$$
R_{abcd}=g_{ae}R^{e}_{bcd}=\sum_{e}g_{ae}R^{e}_{bcd}=R^{a}_{bcd}=\partial_{c}\Gamma^{a}_{db}-\partial_{d}\Gamma^{a}_{bc}
$$
Therefore we have
$$
R_{ijkl}+R_{ljki}=\partial_{k}\Gamma^{i}_{jl}-\partial_{l}\Gamma^{i}_{jk}+\partial_{k}\Gamma^{l}_{ij}-\partial_{i}\Gamma^{l}_{jk}
$$
But I do not know why we would have
$$
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{l}\Gamma^{k}_{ij}+\partial_{l}\Gamma^{j}_{ik})=-\frac{1}{3}(\partial_{k}\Gamma^{i}_{jl}-\partial_{l}\Gamma^{i}_{jk}+\partial_{k}\Gamma^{l}_{ij}-\partial_{i}\Gamma^{l}_{jk})

884861,A martingale with bounded increments either converges or diverges to both infinities a.s.,"I am reading page 236 ""Probability : theory and examples"" by R. Durrett. Theorem 31. Let $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ be a martingale with $|X_{n+1}-X_n|\leq M<\infty$.

884908,Conformal mapping between symmetric region and unit disc,"Exercise 3 of VII.4 of Conway's Complex Analysis states Let $G$ be a simply connected region which is not the whole plane, and suppose that $\bar{z}\in G$ whenever $z\in G$. Let $a\in G\cap\mathbb{R}$ and suppose that $f:G\rightarrow D=\{z:|z|<1\}$ is a one-one analytic function with $f(a)=0,\ f'(a)>0$ and $f(G) = D$. Let $G_+=\{z\in G:\text{Im }z>0\}$. Show that $f(G_+)$ must lie entirely above or below the real axis. I've been working on the proof via a suggestion given in another posting : show that $f(z) = \overline{f(\bar{z})}$ by looking at the conformal automorphisms of the unit disc.  I see how the result follows directly if this claim is proven, but I'm having difficulty in showing the claim itself. My work so far: Let $g:D\rightarrow D$ be a conformal automorphism of the unit disc.  Then $g$ must have the following form:
$g(z) = e^{i\theta}\dfrac{z-\alpha}{1-\bar{z}\alpha}$. I then look at $g(f(z))$ and demand that it have the same properties as $f$, namely, that $g(f(a)) = 0$ and $g'(f(a))f'(a)>0$.  But then $g(z) = z$, which I then realized was obvious from the beginning, because $f$ is the unique function guaranteed by the Riemann Mapping Theorem.... I've also played around with specific curves in $G$.  Let $C_1$ denote the real axis passing through $G$, and $C_2$ the perpendicular line passing through $a+iy$ and $a-iy$, where $y>0$ is such that $a+iy\in G$.  Clearly, the angle between $C_1$ and $C_2$ is $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ at $a$.  Shifting $C_1$ by $it$, we maintain this right angle at $a+it$, $0\leq t\leq y$. By the conformality of $f$ (and some unsightly calculations), I can then show that $f'(a+it) = f'(a-it)$, $0\leq t\leq y$.  This is nifty.  It'd be niftier if I could get it for all $a\in G\cap\mathbb{R}$ and then maybe do an integration trick. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I am teaching myself these things in preparation for a qualifying exam, so nothing is too basic to point out. (Meta comment: I would have asked this question in response to the cited posting, but my reputation isn't high enough yet.

884943,Cramér's Model - “The Prime Numbers and Their Distribution” - Part 4,"Following a previous question ( here you'll find an introduction): A paper by Maier which refutes Cramer's Model suggests we should replace the heuristic ""$\Bbb P(n\in\mathcal P)=1/\log n$"" with $$\Bbb P(n\in\mathcal P|P^-(n)\gt z)=\frac{1}{\log n}\prod_{p\le z\atop p\in\mathcal P}(1-1/p)^{-1}\quad (z\approx \log n)$$ where $P^{-}(n)$ denotes the least prime number that divides n.
The book states that the new heuristic leads us to expects that the strong Cramér's conjecture $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{(\log p_n)^2}=1$$ (which is derived in this paper by Cramer ) is false and should be replaced by $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{(\log p_n)^2}=2\mathrm e^{-\gamma}$$ where $p_n$ denotes the $n^{th}$ prime number, and $\gamma$ denotes Euler's constant.
For proving this last implication, I should mention Mertens' formula: $$\prod_{p\le z\atop p\in\mathcal P}(1-1/p)^{-1}=\mathrm e^\gamma\log z+O(1)\quad(z\ge 1)$$ I couldn't prove this.","['prime-numbers', 'prime-gaps', 'probability', 'number-theory']"

The solution given here http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/256A/1.5.pdf , assumes that $L$ is given by $y=0$. This is without loss of generality, since we can always arrive there by a linear change of coordinates. Then the solution looks at $Y\ \cap U_z$, i.e. in the affine open chart where $z \neq 0$, and writes the equations that givees $Y \cap U_z$ as $f(x) + y(*)=0$.

Note that I only have a resolution in terms of $\mathbb{Z}[H]$-modules, not $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-modules.

By the hypothesis, and the Hurewicz Isomorphism Theorem we can see that $\tilde{H}_i(S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C}) = 0$ for $i \in \{ 0,1 \}$. We also have that $\tilde{H}_2(S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C}) \cong \pi_2 (S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C})$. If I can prove that $\pi_2 (S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C}) \neq 0$, then use of the Sphere Theorem of Papakyriakopoulos enables us to split the two distinct points $p$ and $q$ by an embedding of a $2$-sphere. My question then is how we prove that $\tilde{H}_2(S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C}) \neq 0$; I had two separate ideas for this - none of which have come to any fruition: If we consider $S^3 \setminus \{p_0, p_1, p_2, ..., p_n \}$ then this is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $n$ $2$-spheres. I'm not therefore sure whether we are able to stretch this to a Cantor set to claim it is homotopy equivalent to an infinite wedge of circles, so has a non trivial $\tilde{H}_2(S^3 \setminus \mathcal{C})$; seeing as, for example, the Cantor set could have positive Lebesgue measure? To use a Mayer-Vietoris sequence - I'm not sure quite how the sequence would arise; I've tried a few different approaches, but I thought maybe we could take an $n$-cell which contains $\mathcal{C}$, however I'm not sure we can ensure this exists, because I think $\mathcal{C}$ isn't necessarily bound in $S^3$?

I wondered: why are open sets the correct way to view the steps?

885341,"Unified notion of what ""$dx$"" means","The symbol $dx$ in calculus is at first introduced just as a form of notation: in differentiation, $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$ means the derivative of the function $y$ with respect to $x$. Letting $f(x) = y$, other notations are $f'(x)$, $\dot{y}$ (Newton's ""fluxion"" notation, used in physics), and $D_x[f]$ (""differential operator"" notation). It also appears in integration: $$\int f(x)\ dx$$ means the anti-derivative of $f$ with respect to the variable $x$, and if the integral is a definite integral, again, it just denotes the variable with which we are integrating ""with respect to"". So it seems that $dx$ is just notation, nothing more, nothing less. Yet then you may come across something weird like this: $$\frac{dy}{dx} = x$$
$$dy = x\ dx$$
$$\int dy = \int x\ dx$$
$$y = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$$ Yet the above bunch of manipulations is, from the ""notation"" point of view, nonsense: ""$dy$"" and ""$dx$"" are not quantities, just pieces of notation. Saying $dy = \mathrm{something}$ is as ridiculous as saying $\sqrt{} = \mathrm{something}$. Yet it works. Now, when we include more advanced math as well as the basic math, it seems we can compile the following list of answers as to ""what $dx$ really is"" -- and they're not one thing!: It's just notation . That's what we just did. But then the above manipulation is nonsense. Someone said on this site that this was only a ""particularly unenlightening"" way to look at it. It's a limit . $dx$ is what happens to $\Delta x$ as it arbitrarily small. Yet this is not rigorous enough -- to make the above manipulation work, it seems we have to pass out of the limit back to $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ since the limit of each is $0$. It's a differential form . This gives the first ""rigorous"" definition. But here, we pull in manifold theory and non -Euclidean spaces to do our work, which while it is at home in advanced math, is definitely not something you'd want to put in Calculus class, where we are dealing with the conceptually much simpler Euclidean spaces, and if you want to make rigorous $dx$-manipulations in Euclidean space, seems like serious overkill. This also runs into problems with integration -- what happens if we are integrating dis continuous functions? This brings us to... It's a measure . This definition seems limited only to integration. In this case, $dx$ in the integral stands for a measure -- a function which assigns a ""size"" (""length"", ""area"", ""volume"", etc.) to subsets of the real line or Euclidean space, in particular the Lebesgue measure, which generalizes our usual, intuitive notion of ""length"", ""area"", etc. . Again, this is heavy as we have to delve into the deep structure of the real line but of course it's an advanced concept as well. Nevertheless, it doesn't require non-Euclidean spaces, and can be applied to discontinuous functions, but of course only works with integration (note you can't differentiate a discontinuous function). It's an infinitely small number . This was how it was, in fact, originally conceived by the fathers of calculus. This approach was formalized rigorously by Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis . This approach seems to be the heaviest of them all, as it requires probing down into mathematical logic to really understand the formalism -- in particular ""model theory"" and ""ultrapowers"" to extend the real line with infinitesimal numbers in such a way as to permit analysis to be done. Now, it seems that 3) and 4) can be thought of as ""differential"" and ""integral"" notions of what ""$dx$"" means. 1) and 2) are not so helpful. My question is: is there a single, unifying notion which ties all these together -- a ""one true meaning of $dx$""? Or is ""$dx$"" a bunch of very, very different concepts, and thus it is silly to point to one or the other and call it the ""real"" meaning?",['calculus']
885349,An example of stochastic process,"I use the following definition for a stochastic process.

He plotted the two numbers x and y on a graph with both x and y varying from $0$ to $1$. This gives us a unit square.

First conclusion: Let U be a strictly concave function on $\mathbb{R}^+$ and let $w,z,y>x\geq 0$. Then, the equality $U(y)-U(x) = U(w) - U(z)$ implies due to strict concavity of $U$ that $w-z > y-x$.

Second conclusion (converse): For a function $U$ and for all $w,z,y>x\geq 0$ such that $w-z > y-x$ it holds that $U(y)-U(x) = U(w) - U(z)$. Hence, $U$ is concave on $\mathbb{R}^+$.

\mathcal{O}_X(U)=\{s\colon U\to\coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} A_\mathfrak{p} \mid s(\mathfrak{p})\in A_\mathfrak{p} \text{ and } s \text{ is locally a quotient of elements of $A$}\}
$$
for an open set $U\subseteq X$. I've read in a comment to another question ''An element $f\in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ can be seen as a function whose value at $\mathfrak{p}\in U$ is $f(\mathfrak{p})\in\kappa(\mathfrak{p})$, so that the codomain of $f$ is the union of all residue fields $\kappa(\mathfrak{p})$.'' An $s\in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$  (using Hartshorne's definition) may be post-composed by the coproduct of the maps $A_\mathfrak{p}\to \kappa(\mathfrak{p})$ that factor out the maximal ideal to obtain a map
$$
f\colon U\xrightarrow{s}\coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} A_\mathfrak{p}\to \coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} \kappa(\mathfrak{p}).
$$ Is this assignment (of $f$ to an $s$) injective? I.e. are two $s,s'\in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ equal if the corresponding maps to the coproducts of the residue field (i.e. the assigned $f$ and $f'$) are equal? If yes, does the comment suggest, that there is an alternative definition of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ as
  $$
\mathcal{O}_X(U)=\{s\colon U\to\coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} \kappa(\mathfrak{p}) \mid \text{some properties}\} ?
$$ Suppose from now on that $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is an integral scheme with generic point $\xi$. Then one has injective homomorphisms
$$
\mathcal{O}_X(U) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}=A_\mathfrak{p}\hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X,\xi} = A_\xi = \operatorname{Frac}(A)
$$
and inside the big ring $\operatorname{Frac}(A)$ (which is a field), one may write (or ''define'' if you like)
$$
\mathcal{O}_X(U) = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} \mathcal{O}_{X,\mathfrak{p}} = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{p}\in U} A_\mathfrak{p}.
$$ I am very confused: How does this last ''definition'' through an intersection of the local rings $A_\mathfrak{p}$ relate to Hartshorne's definition of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ which seems to me more like (a special subset of) a union of the local rings $A_\mathfrak{p}$?",['algebraic-geometry']

If supplementary conditions are necessary (such as the spaces being topological and the probabilities being inner-regular etc.), then why are they needed? The question is motivated by the fact that the (arbitrary) product can be constructed in a purely measurable context, without any topological assumptions. Finally, why is the space in the Kolmogorov-Daniell theorem required to be Polish? The proof only uses the fact that finite products of Polish spaces remain Polish and that probabilities on them are inner-regular; but both properties stay valid for an even more general class of spaces (Suslin spaces, for sure; I am not sure about Radon spaces), so why only Polish spaces?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

885963,Solution for this Logarithmic Equation,"Recently I was going through a problem from the book Problems in Mathematics - *V Govorov & P Dybov* . 
$$(x-2)^{\log^2(x-2)+\log(x-2)^5-12}=10^2\log(x-2)$$ I tried solving by first considering $\log(x-2)$ as a variable, say $t$. Then I expressed $(x-2)$ as $10^t$ . Then after using some properties of log, I reached till here- 
$$10^{t^3+5t^2-12t}=10^2t$$
or $$10^{t^3+5t^2-12t-2}=t$$
Now I have no idea how to approach further.
The answer in the references says ${x=3, 102, 2+10^{-7}}$","['quadratics', 'exponentiation', 'logarithms', 'algebra-precalculus']"
885970,Determine whether the following are groups or not...,"The groups to be determined are
$$(\mathbb{R},*) \; \mathbb{defined \; by \;} a*b=a+b+ab\;\;\;\;\;\forall \;a,b\in\mathbb{R}$$
and
$$\mathbb{Z\times Z\;defined \;by} \; (a,b)*(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd) \;\;\;\;\;\forall\;a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$$ I've made an attempt at the both, but am not sure if I am correct or even have sound arguments. Denote our group to $G$. Here's an attempt If $a,b \in G=(\Bbb R,*)$, then it follows that $a+b \in G$ and $ab \in G$. Thus, $a + b + ab \;\mathbb{must\;} \in G$ so we have closure. Now, suppose $c \in G$. Then, 
  $$a*b*c=a+(b+c+abc) = (a +b+c)+abc$$
  and so $G$ satisfies the associative property. Now, we need to find an identity. Let's denote our potential identity to be $e$ $\in G$. Then, for $a\in G$
  $$a=a*e=a+e+ae=a+0+a(0)=a$$
  since under addition, we have that $e=0$. Lastly, we need to see if there exists an inverse for $G$. We have to satisfy $a*f=e$, so we let f be our potential inverse. Hence,
  $a*f=a+f+af=a+a^{-1}+aa^{-1} \neq e = 0$.
  Under addition, $a^{-1}=-a$, but $a(-a)=-a^2$. This does not give us 0, unless $a=0$. Therefore, G is not a group.
  $$\\$$
  $$\\$$
  Now, if $a,b\in G=(\Bbb Z\times \Bbb Z,*)$, then it follows that $(a,b)*(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd) \;\mathbb{must}\; \in G$ so we have closure. Now, suppose $(q,r)\in G$. Then
  $$(a,b)*(c,d)*(q,r)=(ad+bc,bd)+(cr+dq,dr)$$
  It is impossible to satisfy the associative property with our $*$ is defined, so $G$ is not a group. So I'm sure there are many mistakes, as I began to get very confused with this problem. Could anyone guide me along the correct road?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
885972,Calculating a dual variety to a Chow variety,"I am unfamiliar with algebraic geometry, yet I am faced with calculating three special cases of the following (the full text can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4659 ) The $n^{\times d}$-hyperdeterminant of a symmetric tensor of degree $d \ge 2$ on $n \ge 2$ variables splits as the product $\prod_\lambda \Xi_{\lambda,n}^{M_\lambda}$

$Chow_\lambda \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ when it is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{\binom{n-1+d}{d}-1}$, $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \ldots , \lambda_s)$ is a partition of $d$, and the multiplicity $M_\lambda = \binom{d}{\lambda_1, \ldots , \lambda_s}$ is the multinomial coefficient. This is theorem 1.1 of the paper by Oeding, L., (2012) titled “Hyperdeterminants of Polynomials” in Advances in Mathematics, 231, 1308-1326.  The theorem is followed by this explanation: “Geometrically, this theorem is essentially a statement about the symmetrization of the dual variety of the Segre variety. It says that the symmetrization of this dual variety becomes the union of several other varieties (with multiplicities).” I am told that for a given $n$ and $d$ this formula produces a single polynomial. I need to know what these specific polynomials look like for the cases where $n = 2$ and $d = 2, 3, 4$.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",['algebraic-geometry']

885998,Physical interpretation of $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms,"In signal analysis, students have no qualms about associating the $L_2$ norm of a square integrable function $f(t)$ as the energy associated with that signal. A good understanding of whether a function $f(t)$ is a square integrable function is to picture whether it has finite amount of energy. I find this to be an extremely useful knowledge. However, when I plot the $L_1$ norm of a given function, all I'm getting is the total positive area lying under the curve. Which leads to two important questions: How did $L_2$ norm get associated with being the energy of a signal? I.e. what is the physics involved? What is the physical interpretation of the $L_1$ norm? I find ""area"" not very convincing not only given the enormous physical intuition behind the $L_2$ norm but an area is still more of a construction from a mathematical perspective.","['signal-processing', 'mathematical-physics', 'normed-spaces', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
