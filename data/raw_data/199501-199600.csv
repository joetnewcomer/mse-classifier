3884804,Evaluate $\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{k+1}}\right)-1\right)$ from polynomial,"I found the problem online (without solution) that to evaluate $$\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{k+1}}\right)-1\right)$$ given that we know how to solve polynomial $$4x^3-3x+1 = 0$$ Right now I know that $$0<\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{k+1}}\right)-1\right)\leq 1$$ due to the fact that $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{k+1}}\right) = 1$ so we should have something like $0<(0.8...)...(\text{almost 1})...<1$ (my guess is that our answer is around $0.8$ to $0.9$ ) and I also know that the solution for the polynomial is $x = -1, \frac{1}{2}$ . One thing I found out interesting is that the polynomial can be express as $(x+1)(2x-1)^2$ in which is quite the same with our product if we let $x = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3^{k+1}}\right)$ . So how can I solve this problem using the polynomial? Could anyone provides me a hint or some guideline to solve this problem?","['infinite-product', 'algebra-precalculus']"
3884828,About the roots of the derivative of a special polynomial,"Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $n_1,\dots,n_{p-2}, m$ be even integers such that $n_1 < n_2 < \dots < n_{p-2}$ and \begin{equation}
2m > \sum_{i=1}^{p-2} n_i^2.
\end{equation} Consider the polynomial \begin{equation}
g(x)=(x^2 + m)(x - n_1) \dots (x - n_{p-2}).
\end{equation} From Rolle's Theorem , we know that for each $i=1,2,\dots,p-3$ , there exists $x_i \in (n_i,n_{i+1})$ such that $g'(x_i)=0$ . So $g'(x)$ has at least $p-3$ distinct real zeroes. My question is: can $g'(x)$ have more than $p-3$ distinct real zeroes? I do not know the answer, but for sure the constraints on the parameters are relevant here. For example the polynomial $g(x)=(x^2+1)(x-4)(x-2)(x+2)$ has derivative $g'(x)=5x^4-16x^3-9x^2+24x-4=(x-1)(5x^3-11x^2-20x+4)$ which has four distinct real roots, as you can check on WolframAlpha . NOTE This strange polynomial arises in the construction given by R. Brauer of a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree $p$ whose Galois group over $\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_p$ : see Jacobson, Basic Algebra I, $\S 4.10$ . The question I asked is clearly irrelevant for the construction, but has intrigued me, since I could not answer it in the negative nor I could find some counterexample.","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'real-analysis']"

3885008,recursive sequence proofs,"I'm kinda new to recursive sequences and I'm struggling with an excercise. I apologize in advance for the long question and my lack of knowledge on how to approach such problems. Let $x_n$ be defined such that $x_1 = 1$ , $x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2+1}5$ And there there are 4 things I have to prove/show, (1) Show that $x_n$ $\leq$ $1$ for all $n$ . I'm not sure if I can prove this directly or by induction? What would be best for this? I don't know how to approach this when it's defined recursively. (2) Show that $\lvert x_{n+1} - x_n \rvert$ $\leq (\frac{2}{5})^{n-1}$ I'm not sure but could I use $\lvert\frac{x_{n+1}^2+1}{5}$ $-$ $\frac{x_n^2+1}{5}\rvert$$\leq (\frac{2}{5})^{n-1}$ and then try to solve this. How do i deal with the $x_n$ ? (3) Show that $x_n$ is a Cauchy-sequence. I know that a Cauchy sequence is defined as : For every positive real number $\varepsilon$ , there is a positive integer $N$ such that for all natural numbers $m, n \gt N$ : $\lvert x_m - x_n \rvert \lt \varepsilon$ . Can I apply this definition directly in this sequence and the go on from there? (4) Calculate the limit of $x_n$ . This should be straightforward if it weren't a recursively defined sequence. If I however, calculate the first few elements of the sequence I get: $x_1 = 1$ , $x_2 = \frac{2}{5}$ , $x_3 = \frac{29}{125}$ , $x_4 = \frac{841}{15625}$ $\ldots$ This approaches $0$ (I'm guessing) since the second term is smaller than $1$ . And since a square of a number less than $1$ is always smaller than the original number, $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}$ $= 0$ . How can I prove this correctly without just trying different numbers?

3885012,Left multiplication commuting functions (proof verification),"Let $G$ be a group and $g \in G$ . Define $\lambda_g: G \rightarrow G$ by $\lambda_g(x) = gx$ for all $x \in G$ . Similarly, define $\tau_g: G \rightarrow G$ by $\tau_g(x) = xg$ for all $x \in G$ . If $\theta: G \rightarrow G$ is a bijection such that $\lambda_g \theta = \theta \lambda_g$ for all $g \in G$ , show that $\theta = \tau_h$ for some $h \in G$ . My proof is as follows: Since $\lambda_g \theta = \theta \lambda_g$ for all $g \in G$ , we have $$ g \theta(x) = \lambda_g(\theta(x)) = \theta (\lambda_g(x)) = \theta(gx) $$ for all $g, x \in G$ . In particular, we have $$x^{-1} \theta(x) = \theta(x^{-1}x) = \theta(1)$$ or $\theta(x) = x\theta(1)$ for all $x \in G$ . Hence $\theta = \tau_{\theta(1)}$ as required.

3885078,Solving third order linear ODE using symmetric square basis,"In M. van Hoeij talk on ""Solving Third Order Linear Differential Equations

3885191,Proof of inversion formula in Probability,"Theorem : Let $X$ be a real random variable such that $\phi_X \in L^1$ i.e $\int_{\mathbb{R}} \vert \phi_X(t) \vert < \infty$ , then $X$ has density $f_X(x) \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$ given by $$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt$$ (Where $\phi_X$ denotes the characteristic function of $X$ ) The proof articulates in two parts : The first where we assume we already know $X$ has a density $f$ and we prove the inequality above, the second where we don't know such $f$ exists and we lead back to the first case using the trick of taking $X+\epsilon N$ where $N \sim N(0,1)$ . The sketch of the first part of the proof, which is where my problems are is the following : We consider a $g \geq 0, g \in C_{b}(\mathbb{R})$ , such that $g = 0$ outside a compact, i.e $g \in C_{c}(\mathbb{R})$ and we apply the isometry lemma to $f_X + g$ which leads us to (Using Fubini-Tonelli and the fact that $\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt$ is real) $$\int g(x)f_X(x)dx = \mathbb{E}[g(X)] = \int g(x)[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt]dx$$ Which concludes the proofs for $g$ assumed as mentioned at the beginning.
But how to extend the result to just continuos and bounded functions ? During this next proof the following three observation are made : $1) \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt$ is continuos in $x$ (and I was able to prove it as a consequence of dominated convergence theorem, prooving continuity by sequences). $2) \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt \geq 0$ 3) $\hspace{0.1cm} \exists \hspace{0.1cm} g_n \uparrow 1 $ with $g_n \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$ I was able to prove step $2)$ in the following way with an hint which I was unable to prove (so this should be the way to prove it). The proof goes like this : if it was strictly negative, by continuity (prooved in the first observation) exists an open set $U$ where the function is still strictly negative, and then I can find a $g > 0, g \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$ defined on $U$ and conclude by contradiction thanks to the fact that in this case we would have $0 > \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi_X(t)e^{-itx}dt = E[g(X)] > 0$ , thanks to $g$ . As far concerned the third point I don't know where to start, I thought it could be useful to use a simplified version of Urysohn Lemma but unsuccefully.
I was unable to prove the highlighted sentences, there are any way to explicit such functions ? Any direct proof, explicit or not, would be appreciated, and some reference of using Fourier trasfrom in Probability as well, those seemed nice tricks to know.","['integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'fourier-transform', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

3885368,Rescaling a function to equalize impact of input variables,"Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. Suppose that disturbing one variables changes the function value much more than disturbing the other variable, $$
|f(x+\varepsilon,y)-f(x,y)| \gg |f(x,y+\varepsilon)-f(x,y)| \,.
$$ This poor scaling property challenges computer solvers to find the roots of $f$ , see here for Matlab . The matlab team suggests to rescale the function such that '' each coordinate has about the same effect on the objective function ''. Example (from Mathwork). A poorly scaled function is $f(x,y)= 10^6 x^2 + 10^{-6}y^2$ . Instead, we can try to solve $g(x,y)=0$ where $g(x,y)= f\left(\begin{pmatrix} 10^{-3} & 0 \\ 0 & 10^3 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x \\y\end{pmatrix}\right)=f(10^{-3}x,10^3y)$ . Question : Is there a more general approach to rescale a function? In Mathwork's example, $\begin{pmatrix} 10^{-3} & 0 \\ 0 & 10^3 \end{pmatrix}$ is pretty obvious but how could one come up with a suitable rescaling if the problem isn't that obvious? Is there a general hint on how I can equalize the effect of input variables on the function value? While my question is a bit more general, it originates from my problem of finding the roots of \begin{align*}
f(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix} \left(\frac{c_1c_3 }{c_1-c_2}\left(\frac{c_2 c_3}{(y-c_6)(c_1-c_2)}\right)^{-\frac{c_2}{c_1}} +c_6 \right) \frac{c_2}{c_1}x^{c_2-c_1}+\frac{x^{1-c_1}}{c_1c_5}-y \\

3885460,Inscribing Platonic solids in each other: why can't you put a dodecahedron in an octahedron?,"Given convex polyhedra $P, Q$ , say that one can inscribe $P$ in $Q$ if we can find points on the surface of $Q$ whose convex hull is similar to $P$ . If we restrict $P, Q$ to be Platonic solids, we can achieve every case except inscribing the dodecahedron into the tetrahedron, cube, or octahedron; the other $17$ distinct pairs work. For the $17$ working cases, there are ""nice"" constructions, where the solids are positioned in symmetric ways with respect to each other. Consequently, such constructions are pretty easy to verify by a combination of symmetry arguments, direct computation of one or two distances, and arguments from degrees of freedom / continuity. To see examples of these pairs, Moritz Firsching's 2018 paper ""Computing maximal copies of polytopes contained in a polytope"" (PDF link via arXiv.org) shows instances of maximal containment, most of which have ""nice"" symmetry (or are obviously given by e.g. taking duals). Perhaps the hardest case to see a ""nice"" construction for is the cube inside the tetrahedron, pictured below (bold edges tangent to the faces): For two of the three impossible cases, I have simple proofs of impossibility: If a dodecahedron were inscribed in a tetrahedron, every face would need to have a pentagon on it, but the dodecahedron doesn't have four mutually disjoint faces. If a dodecahedron were inscribed in a cube, then any face with at least three of the vertices of the dodecahedron would have to have an entire pentagon on it (and no more of the vertices), since three points determine a plane and the dodecahedron is convex. Then (by simple counting) at least three of the cube's faces must have such a pentagon on them, so two such are orthogonal to each other. But the dodecahedron has no orthogonal faces. However, I know of no such proof that the dodecahedron cannot be inscribed in the octahedron; it seems fairly plausible, at first glance, that one could mount the dodecahedron with two opposite faces tangent to opposite faces of the octahedron and arrange the other $10$ points across the other $6$ faces of the octahedron somehow. The simplest proof I know involves doing some gross trigonometry involving the necessary side length of such a dodecahedron and the inradius of the regular $10$ -gon formed by taking an equatorial cross-section of the dodecahedron in between these two opposite faces. Is there a conceptually simple proof that this construction is impossible? I realize this is somewhat subjective, but I hope the intended style of argument is clear: reasoning from symmetry and combinatorial incidences, rather than bashing the coordinates of different vertices.","['polyhedra', 'convex-geometry', 'geometry', 'alternative-proof', 'platonic-solids']"

 F(x+\Delta x)&=\int_a^{x+\Delta x}\ f(u) \mathrm{d}u\\[1ex]

 F(x+\Delta x)&= F(x)+\int_x^{x+\Delta x} f(u)\  \mathrm{d}u\\[1ex]
\implies\frac{F(x+\Delta x)-F(x)}{\Delta x}&=\frac{1}{\Delta x}\int_x^{x+\Delta x}f(u) \ \mathrm{d}u
\end{align} Letting $\Delta x \to 0$ the LHS becomes $\frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}$ whereas the RHS becomes $f(x)$ . The latter conclusion follows because when $\Delta x$ is small the value of the integral on the RHS approximately becomes $f(x)\Delta x$ , and in the limit $\Delta x \to 0$ no approximation is involved.

( $1$ divides $1$ ) More example $n = 4$ and $r = 2$ . $r$ divides $4$ and $4/2$ divides $\binom{4}{2}$ ( $2$ divides $6$ ) More example $n = 6$ and $r = 2$ . $r$ divides $6$ and $6/2$ divides $\binom{6}{2}$ ( $3$ divides $15$ ) More example $n = 12$ and $r = 4$ . $r$ divides $12$ and $12/4$ divides $\binom{12}{4}$ ( $3$ divides $495$ ) Now my question is - is this always the case? I tried proving it myself by expanding the factorials and cancelling the terms but failed to prove. Then I tried proving it by a combinatorial proof. Then I proved it for one case.
That one case was where $n$ is even and $r = n/2$ .
Then we can say $\binom{n}{n/2}$ counts the number of ways of selecting any $n/2$ things and not selecting the other $n/2$ automatically. So consider any one such case where $A$ is set of $n/2$ selected things and $B$ is set of $n/2$ not selected things. Then we can say there will be another case corresponding to this one where we select the $n/2$ elements in $B$ and not select the $n/2$ elements in $A$ . So these cases will be in pairs and so they will be even this proves only one case where $n$ is even and $r=n/2$ . I need help in proving this statement for all cases. How can I prove it?","['combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs']"

Here's a picture of what I mean : (That's an approximate diagram of what I mean; sorry for the crude diagram) Here, the horizontal blue line on the top row (when considered a straight line) connects many dots to a single point (thus all those dots on the line are collinear), so when we count the number of dispersion lines, we have to count lines connecting many collinear points as one and we mustn't take the subunits into consideration. So when we consider a square dot matrix, where the dots are arranged as a square, we can draw $3$ apparent dispersion lines, plus some more. What I would like to find is a formula to calculate the number of dispersion lines in square dot grids (or dot matrices). What I have at hand is this one formula that I tried to formulate today: $$n^2 - (n + 2(n - 1)) + 3$$ The problem is that this formula isn't working for all values of $n$ (I mean, the number of dots in a column/row of the square dot matrix), and also I haven't been able to spend sufficient time to find the number of dispersion lines for $n > 5$ . If asked for, I'll attach the numbers below. Any help in formulating an accurate formula is appreciated. If such a formula exists, please do tell me.

Choose $\displaystyle x=\frac{k\pi}{n}$ we have then $$\sin\left(\frac{k\pi }{n}\right)\leq \frac{k\pi}{n}\Rightarrow S(n)= \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{k}{n}\sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right)\leq \pi\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{k^2}{n^2}=\frac{\pi}{6}\left[\frac{(n-1)(2n-1)}{n}\right]\cdots(1)$$ Since  the partial sum of the later sum diverges as $n\to \infty$ so $S(n)\to \infty$ (due to comparison test). Therefore, $$L=\lim_{n\to \infty} \left(1+\left(S(n)\right)^{-1}\right)^{n}=1^{\infty}$$ and hence we have $$L= \lim_{n\to\infty}\exp\left(\left(S(n)\right)^{-1}\right)=\exp\left(\lim_{n\to \infty}n\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{k}{n}\sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right)\right)^{-1}\right)$$ since latter expression is Riemann integrable function on $[0,1]$ so the limit reduces to $$L= \exp\left(\int_0^1 x\sin(\pi x) dx\right)^{-1} \underbrace {=}_{IBP}e^{\left(\pi^{-1}\right)^{-1}}=e^{\pi}$$ The reason of $(1)$ in above is to show that for large value  of $n$ the original sum is divergent so that its reciprocal is $0$ giving us $1^{\infty}$ form.

3888269,False duality of diagonalizable/constant group scheme?,"The following is an introduction to constant group scheme and diagonalizable group scheme. Let $M$ be an arbitrary abstract group and $S$ be a scheme. Let $M_S=\coprod_{i\in M}S_i$ where $S_i=S$ ,which can be constructed via glueing data of a scheme see tag 01JA . Then $M_S$ is called the constant group scheme over $S$ associated to $M$ . And for any $S$ -scheme $T$ , $M_S(T)=\{\text{locally constant functions }f:|T|\to M\}$ , where $|T|$ has Zariski topology and $M$ has discrete topology, and locally constant function is defined to be $\forall t\in T,\exists U\ni t\text{ open}$ s.t. $f(U)={f(t)}$ . see tag 03YW The dual of a group scheme $G$ over $S$ is a scheme representing the functor $T/S\mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Gr}-T}(G_T,\mathbb{G}_m)$ . For a constant group scheme $M_S$ , its dual is denoted as $D(M)$ or $D_S(M)$ and they are precisely the diagonalizable group schemes. In particular, it exists and $\DeclareMathOperator{\Spec}{Spec}D_S(M)\cong \Spec \mathbb{Z}[M]\times_{\Spec \mathbb{Z}}S$ where $\mathbb{Z}[M]$ is the group ring $\bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathbb{Z}_i$ with an obvious ring structure. Note that $D_S(M)$ is always commutative no matter whether $M$ is commutative. It's known in a few reference that if $M$ is commutative then $D_SD_S(M)=M_S$ i.e. $M_S$ is reflexive. (e.g. SGA3,Expose VIII,Page 3,Theoreme 1.2 or [Groupe Algeacutebriques by Demazure and Gabriel, Chap II,§2,2.11 Dualite des groupes diagonalisables]). But none of the proof seems convincing. And I seem to find a counterexample in some sense. From my understanding of the corresponding between $\DeclareMathOperator{\itSpec}{\mathit{Spec}}D_SD_S(M)(T)=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Gr}-T}(\itSpec_{\mathcal{O}_T}\mathcal{O}_T[M],\mathbb{G}_m)$ and $M_S(T)$ . A element in $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Gr}-T}(\itSpec_{\mathcal{O}_T}\mathcal{O}_T[M],\mathbb{G}_m)$ corresponds to a map of $\mathcal{O}_T$ -algebras $f:\mathcal{O}_T[t,t^{-1}]\to \mathcal{O}_T[M]=\bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T$ s.t. $\epsilon f(t)=1$ and $\Delta(f(t))=f(t)\otimes f(t)$ . If we write $f(t)=\sum_{i\in M}a_i\cdot e_i\in \bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T(T)$ then we have $a_i \cdot a_j=\delta_{ij}a_i$ and $1=\sum_i a_i$ (so each $a_i$ is an idempotent element in $\mathcal{O}_T(T)$ ). Clearly $\forall s\in T,1|_s=\sum_i a_i|_s$ so at least one of $a_i$ is supported on $s$ . And $T_{s_i} \cap T_{s_j}=T_{s_is_j}=T_0=\emptyset$ . So $(T_{s_i})_{i\in M}$ forms a disjoint open cover of $T$ which can be identified with a locally constant function from $T$ to $M$ . But the only problem is, $\sum_{i\in M}a_i\cdot e_i\in \bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T(T)$ has only finite terms, which means the induced locally constant map has only a finite image. And I believe that there exists locally constant functions $T\to M$ with infinite image, which cannot be induced from $\mathcal{O}_T[t,t^{-1}]\to \mathcal{O}_T[M]=\bigoplus_{i\in M}\mathcal{O}_T$ . So which part of my arugments is wrong? Or do we need some extra conditions on $M$ (like finite or finitely generated) or the base scheme $S$ (like locally Noetherian, locally connected or connected)? Or the duality only holds in some topology like fppf/etale topology?","['group-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'duality-theorems']"

Suppose $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ , and $f\geq0$ for all $x$ , prove that $f+f'+f''+f'''+\cdots +f^n\geq0$ . (so just functions of the form $ax^n+bx^{n-1}+.....c$ . We are not going to include irrational functions, exponential, logs, etc.) So for this problem, I looked at a few functions and graphed them to see why this statement would be true. The first thing I found out is that the polynomial's highest degree must be even, otherwise there would be some $x$ where $f(x)$ is negative. Now this implies the odd numbered derivatives will have an odd number for the term with the highest degree. Having figured that out, I was wondering whether the sum of every successive would change the function so that $f+f'$ has negative values, and $f+f'+f''$ would have positive values and so on, and this does turn out to be true for the ones I've tried. If this is true in general, that would mean that $f+f'$ has some negative values, $f+f'+f''$ has not negative values, and $f+f'+f''+f'''+....f^{n-1}$ has negative values until we get to $f+f'+f''+f'''+....f^{n-1}+f^n$ which has no negative values.

3888486,What are the known convex polyhedra with congruent faces?,"A monohedral polyhedron is one whose faces are all congruent. Note that this is a weaker condition than being isohedral (face-transitive). We have a classification of all convex isohedral polyhedra, consisting of 30 classes of assorted finite polyhedra and infinite families. See Wolfram Mathworld for a list. In the process of writing this answer , I was trying to find instances of convex polyhedra which are monohedral but not isohedral, and struggled to find a classification of such shapes or even a list of known instances with an outline of which cases remain open. The instances I know of beyond the isohedral polyhedra given above: When the faces are regular polygons, we can search among the Johnson solids to find three non-isohedral examples: the snub disphenoid , the triaugmented triangular prism , and the gyroelongated square bipyramid . The pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron , the dual of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron. In footnote 46 on page 185 of Advances in Discrete and Computational Geometry: Proceedings of the 1996 AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference, Discrete and Computational Geometry , it is remarked that no other convex non-isohedral monohedra are known with non-triangular faces (or at least, none were known in 1996). ( Here is a Google Books link to the relevant section of the previous source.) However, in a result apparently unknown to the above source, Ed Pegg provides what seems to be a counterexample in this mathSE question ; manually cutting out and folding the net, it does indeed seem to fold into a convex polyhedron. In the article The Bilinski Dodecahedron and Assorted Parallelohedra, Zonohedra, Monohedra, Isozonohedra, and Otherhedra (Grünbaum, B., 2010), the author includes the rhombic icosahedron and the Belinski dodecahedron , and cites Belinski as proving that these are the only convex monohedra with centrally symmetric faces (such polyhedra termed isozonohedra ) not already listed among the isohedra. In David Eppstein's paper On Polyhedral Realization with Isosceles Triangles (link to arXiv abstract), three infinite families of convex monohedra not given above are listed, with isosceles triangle faces: one consisting of a heightened antiprism with pyramids glued to each large opposite face (called a ""gyroelongated bipyramid""), a variant of the previous shape in which two halves are rotated about a skew hexagonal cross-section (called a ""twisted gyroelongated bipyramid""), and a shape called the ""biarc hull"" which I can't describe very well but is related to a sphericon . They cite the paper Some New Tilings of the Sphere with Congruent Triangles by Robert Dawson, most of which seem not to translate to monohedral polyhedra but which I haven't checked fully. The answers to this math.SE question , which provide monohedral polyhedra combinatorially equivalent to the icosahedron but with non-equilateral faces. (The scalene case is not always convex, but can be made so with small distortions to the angles of the triangles involved.) The book Advances in Discrete and Computational Geometry mentioned above goes into more detail about the possibility of such polyhedra. Given the apparent lack of a classification of more restricted classes of polyhedra, I expect that no complete classification exists. However, I'd like to better understand the scope of which examples and impossibility results are known, as I haven't been able to find much in the way of a definitive source tackling this question. I'm hoping this question and its answers can at least serve as a better overview of known convex monohedra than the scattered state of information that seems to exist on the problem at present.","['polyhedra', 'convex-geometry', 'geometry', 'reference-request', 'combinatorial-geometry']"

The following is a complete formulation of my question. On an arbitrary measurable space $(E,\mathcal{E})$ , $\mu\ll\nu$ and $\nu$ is a finite measure. Let $p$ denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d\mu/d\nu$ . Show that $p$ is real-valued $\nu$ -almost everywhere. I can find no way to exclude the case that $\nu(\{x\in E|p(x)=+\infty\})=0$ . Can you please help me show that this measure is zero? Thanks a lot.","['measure-theory', 'absolute-continuity', 'almost-everywhere', 'radon-nikodym']"
