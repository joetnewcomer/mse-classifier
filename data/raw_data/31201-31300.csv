292935,How do I find the angles of a triangle if I only have the lengths of the sides?,"Is it possible to find the angles of a triangle if I only have its sides?
If so, how can I achieve this? Regarding my knowledge of triangles:
Whilst I was taught trigonometry a few years ago, I cannot for the life of me remember how to do things like use SOHCAHTOA to figure out the length of a side given an angle and a side. I know it's possible and if that were my problem I would continue searching the internet for a solution, but I gather finding an angle without knowing any of the angles is more difficult.","['trigonometry', 'triangles']"

292953,A valuation ring,"In Qing Liu, Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves , page 116, exemple 4.1.8, one has $\mathcal{O}_K$ a discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter $t$, $P\in\mathcal{O}_K[S]$ an Eisenstein polynomial in $t$ (then irreducible), $\mathcal{O}_L:=\mathcal{O}_K[S]/(P(S))$ (then a integral domain) and with notation $s=\overline{S}$ one has $L=\mathrm{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_L)=K[S]/(P(S))=\bigoplus_{0\leq i\leq n-1} s^i K$. Then we want to prove that, with $\nu_L\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i s^i\right)=\mathrm{min}\{n\nu_K(\alpha_i)+i,i=0,\ldots,n-1\}$, then $\mathcal{O}_L$ is the discrete valuation ring of $L$.

But for $\nu_L\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i s^i \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\beta_j s^j\right)=\nu_L\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i s^i\right)+\nu_L\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\beta_i s^i\right)$ I can't find because as $\nu_L$ is defined only on the form $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i s^i$ the calcul of $\nu_L\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i s^i \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\beta_j s^j\right)=\nu_L\left(\sum_k\left(\sum_{i+j=k}\alpha_i+\beta_j\right)s^k\right)$ is too difficult for me (because of the $s^ k$, $k\geq n$).

293006,Is a stochastic process being continuous a.e. completely determined by its law?,"Given a measure space $(X, \mathcal F, \mu)$, it is always possible
to construct a measurable mapping defined from some other measure
space and with $X$ as its codomain, such that the measure induced by
the mapping is the measure $\mu$ on the codomain. Suppose we further require the measurable mapping to satisfy that
given some subset $A$ of $X$ ($A$ is not necessarily measurable,
i.e. may not be in $\mathcal F$), the mapping maps into $A$ a.e..
Then the existence of such a mapping requires that there exists a $B
    \in \mathcal F$ such that $B \subseteq A$ and $\mu(X - B) = 0$ (correct me if I am wrong). I
was wondering if that necessary condition is also sufficient for
existence of such a mapping? Is it correct that existence of such a $B$ is completely determined
by the measure space $(X, \mathcal F, \mu)$? Among all the
measurable mappings that can induce $\mu$, either all of them map
into $A$ a.e., or neither of them will map into $A$ a.e.? It is
impossible that some of them map into $A$ a.e. and some don't? As an example and also source of my above question, let's look at
construction of a Brownian motion: Given finite dimensional distributions of a Brownian motion, there
exists a unique probability measure $P$ on the sample path space
$\mathbb{R}^T$ where $T:=[0, \infty)$ with its Borel sigma algebra,
by Kolmogorov extension theorem. A Brownian motion also requires its sample path to be continuous
a.e.. Is existence of a Brownian motion equivalent to that the set
$A$ of continuous functions from $T$ to $\mathbb{R}$ contains a
subset which has probability $1$ under $P$? (Note $A$ is not
measurable wrt the Borel sigma algebra over $\mathbb{R}^T$.) Is it possible that there exists a stochastic process with $P$ being
its law, but not continuous a.e.? Thanks and regards!","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes']"

By surjectiveness, A goes injectively into $B$. Since we are dealing with varieites, $A$ and $B$ are finitely generated $k$-algebras with no nilpotents. In fact since the varieties are irreducible, they have no zero divisors. Since a module is flat over a ring if and if for all prime ideals in the ring, the localization of the module is flat over the localized ring, we would be done if we could show that $B$ is flat over $A$.

My problem is that $\varphi_1^{-1}$ need not be differentiable in the usual analysis sense, because $U'$ is not an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Only direction of the axis is important, hence it is divided by its magnitude. However, I am not sure if $\mathbf{x}$ will always have the proper direction (the result can be $-\mathbf{x}$ instead of $\mathbf{x}$?). The rotation matrix is computed using Rodrigues' rotation formula. Finally, the vector $\mathbf{R}a$ should have same direction as $b$.

I suppose both in terms of content and form. Thanks! Proof. First, for some arbitrary $y \in Y$, suppose that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right]$. Then, by definition, $\exists x \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n$ such that $f(x) = y$. And, because we have an intersection, it follows that $\exists x : \forall n\, (x \in B_n)$. In that case, $y \in f\left[B_n\right]$ for each $n$. And therefore, $y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$. So we've shown that $y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right] \implies y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right]$. Now, assuming that $f$ is one-to-one, suppose that we have $y \in f\left[B_n\right]$ for each $n$. So for all $n$, there is an $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. But if $f$ is an injection then, by definition, there is only one such $x$. It follows that for each $n$, this unique $x$ is in $B_n$, that is $x \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n$. And $x \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n \implies y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right] $. So we've shown that $y \in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty f\left[B_n\right] \implies y \in f\left[ \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty B_n\right] $. So the implication goes in both directions, which is what we needed to show. End proof. Thanks in advance for your comments. I really appreciate it.",['elementary-set-theory']

The following graphic based on a standard example from Counterexamples in Probability and Statistics of a 3-dimensional binomial PDF that factorizes pairwise (ie, each of the 3 pairs of random variables are independent and the 2-dim joint distributions can all be written as the product of the respective marginals) but not 3-way independent (the joint distribution cannot be written as the product of the individual marginal distributions) My question is whether the opposite can happen, ie if the 3-dim (or perhaps higher) joint distribution factorizes into the 1-dim marginals, does that imply the pairwise factorization of all 2-dim joint distributions into the marginals?","['statistics', 'terminology', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

293273,how to cover a manifold almost everywhere?,"I pose the following question: Given a connected (maybe we need compactness) manifold or regular surface, can we find a single parametrization $\chi:B\to M$ from the open ball to the manifold, such that $\overline{\chi(B)}=M$ (the closure is to be understood in M)? The sphere and torus have this kind of parametrization, so I wonder if this holds in general. I tried to answer the question using Zorn's lemma, that is, I defined the set of every parametrization from a set $U\cong B$ ($U$ isn't fix) to the manifold and ordered it with the relation: $\chi_{1}\le \chi_{2}$ iff $\textrm{dom}(\chi_{1})\le \textrm{dom}(\chi_{2})$ and they coincide in their domains. The problems have to do with the maximal element, how to prove that it works: How to control the size of the domains of the functions, so that the maximal element hasn't as domain all $R^n$ and $\overline{\chi(U)}\neq M$. Given a parametrization $\chi$ such that there exists $p\in M-\overline{\chi(U)}$, how to extend the parametrization to cover $p$.

So that would make the probability of having at least one ball in each urn, throwing N balls into M urns, go as:
$$p(M,N) = \frac{F(M,N)}{T(M,N)} = \frac{\binom{N-1}{M-1}}{\binom{N+M-1}{M-1}} = \frac{N!(N-1)!}{(N-M)!(N+M-1)!}$$ That doesn't look one bit like the stirling numbers, however, or like the answer you gave me... So, where did I go wrong in my steps? Okay, I completely failed to consider this: he wants me to distinguish the ways that will lead to a certain final ball-urn state, not only the final states themselves, in which case I count 300 only once, but 210 counts 4 times and 111 counts 6 times. So much for my induction on the final sates... So, using the Stirling numbers, that would make the final answer: $$P(M,N) = \frac{\frac{1}{k!}∑_{j=0}^M(-1)^{M-j}\binom{M}{j}j^N}{M^N}$$ That being said, I wonder how I was expected to come to this conclusion, without previous knowledge of the Stirling numbers. Obviously I was supposed to reason them out, but I don't quite see how. Of course that is a fact about my ignorance and not about the problem itself. I shall work on it. Further reading on the Stirling numbers of the second kind article on Wikipedia shows that these numbers are supposed to represent ways to put the balls into unlabelled urns, which would make the following two paths equivalent: 10 -> 20 -> 21 01 -> 02 -> 12 Which they clearly are not, in the problem, because otherwise there wouldn't be $M^N$ ways to fill the urns. In that case, I will remain working on the problem, but what would such a solution look like? Alright, so, following your lead, I got to: $$p(M,N) = 1 - \frac{∑_{j=1}^{M-1}(-1)^{j+1}\binom{M}{j}(M-j)^N}{M^N}$$ And the results agree with induction.

293341,Finding intersecting subsets for given binomial coefficient,"My apologies if this question is more appropriate for mathisfun.com, but I can only get so far reading about combinatrics and set theory before the interlocking logic becomes totally blurred.  If this is a totally fundamental concept, feel free just to name it so I can read and understand the math myself. So the goal is to minimize repetition of questions on a quiz to avoid (or really to slow down) the creation of a master key. This is for a client and I've explained that to make this truly realistic the number of questions in the master pool would need to be huge, but I want to show them the math behind their idea. So they suggested having a 20 question pool with a given set being a 5-member subset.  I figured out that the total number of unique quizes $\binom{20}{5}$ would be $\frac{20!}{5!(20-5)!}$ or 15504 unique quizes.  But I know that most of those quizes will be near identical and that it won't take as long for cheaters to see all 20 questions to make the key. To prove this to myself (without knowing the math), I simplified the total combinations to $\binom{4}{3}$ , like so: {a, b, c, d} = { {a,b,c}; {a,b,d}; {b,c,d}; {a,c,d} } And I see that it only takes seeing any 2 quizes to see all 4 members of the master set.  So knowing that the number of combinations (binomial coefficient!) is not equivalent to number of unique appearances of the master-set, I'd like to know the actual math involved to show the client that while they have a ton of quizes, it only takes $x$ to know all members. Thanks as always. Addendum A bit more research has introduced me to the NP-complete problem known as Exact Cover, which would be (if I'm reading it right) a precise set of subsets which have a union equal to the original master-set.  I just want to clarify that this constraint of perfect overlap is not necessary for my question, only the minimum number of subsets that would result in a union that has all master-set members, regardless of repetition, in order to demonstrate how many subsets are needed to know the original set (with the assumption that the seeker of the master-set knows the total membership count). I tweaked my micro-experiment from $\binom{4}{3}$ to $\binom{4}{2}$ resulting in 6 combinations and the ability to derive the master-set no longer being possible with a specific number of arbitrary subsets. Instead I get: {a, b, c, d} = { {ab} ; {ac} ; {ad} ; {bc} ; {bd} ; {cd} } which could derive the master set using the first three ( $a$ ) groups, or the exact cover of ${ {a,b}; {c,d} }$ .  This has me thinking that the minimum subsets needed to derive the original set is equal to the number of subsets where any given member occurs (so in this case 3 $a$ s, but this doesn't match up to the $\binom{4}{3}$ , where it can be found with 2 subsets.  The next obvious solution (to me) is that the minimum number needed to derive the master-set (blindly) is half of the total number of subsets, but I would really want a link to a proof or a simple-english demonstration on how a pool of 20 questions would require 7752 subsets to know with certainty that all 20 members have appeared at least once. Again, thanks. Question as Probability: I have a bag of Scrabble tiles and I know the following: The bag contains 20 tiles, Each tile is unique (no two tiles have the same character), The tiles come from a much larger (and otherwise irrelevant) set of an expansion set including numbers and non-Roman alphabet characters, thus removing any advantage of knowing that this set of 20 comes from a larger-but-limited set (in other words, the characters are only informative to each other and I may get all Klingon or a mix of Chinese and Tamil. I should not assume anything about the set other than what is in the bag). I am allowed to perform the following steps in the order given as many times as I want: Pull out 5 tiles, Write down the characters drawn, Return the tiles to the bag. Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Also: I have magical fingers that prevent me from drawing the same set of 5 twice, thus reducing the number of draws from infinity to 15504 possible draws. My objective is to have all 20 characters written down eventually and then stop drawing characters. I know that the total number of unique combinations I could draw is $\binom{20}{5}$ which is 15504.  I also know that the minimum draws required is equal to $\lceil{20}/{5}\rceil$ , which would be very lucky.  What I am interested in is the maximum number of draws required to reveal all 20 characters.","['elementary-set-theory', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

293381,Weakly Harmonic Functions (Weak Solutions to Laplace's Equation $\Delta u=0$) and Logic of Test Function Techniques.,"In analysis we often use test functions $\phi\in C_{0}^{\infty}(U)$ in order to make some kind of deduction about another function $u:U\mapsto\mathbb{C}$. For example, if one can obtain the conclusion
$\int_{U}u\phi\;dx=0$ for every $\phi$, then we can conclude $u\equiv0$ in $U$. I have a couple of questions though.  Integration by parts very often comes up in situations involving test functions, and the fact that they are compactly supported allows you to throw out the boundary integrals.  I can see why this is justified when the set $U$ is open, but if $U$ is closed or compact, can we use test functions in the same way?  Or do we really need to restrict ourselves to open domains? My other question has to do with an exercise I'm working on.  It asks us to define a weakly harmonic function as one which satisfies
$$\int_{U}u\Delta\phi\;dx=0,$$
and asks us to prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic:
$\Delta u=0$.  Actually, we are allowed to assume $u$ is continuous in $U$, even though the result is true for more general $u\in L^{1}_{loc}(U)$.  But after proving this, it struck me that the above logic that I've used in various other instances seems contradictory to the present situation.  Applying that logic to the weakly-harmonic condition should imply that $u=0$, since $\Delta\phi$ is more or less an arbitrary function anyway, right? How do you resolve this? With the above questions resolved by Jose's answer (see below), I figured I would go ahead and post a proof to the claim that weak solutions to Laplace's equation are indeed classical solutions, at least under the hypothesis that the weak solution is $\mathscr{C}^{2}(\bar{U})$, and later merely $\mathscr{C}(U)$.  Of course, much of what is presented in the proof generalizes.  Indeed, the first part of the proof is to show that the ''standard'' mollification of a weak harmonic solution is in fact harmonic; by using the concept of an adjoint, it is not difficult to extend my argument to general linear PDE, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  Of course, what follows from there is unique to Laplace's equation $\Delta u=0$; in particular due to the standard mollifier $$\eta_{\epsilon}=\frac{C}{\epsilon^{n}}e^{\frac{1}{|x|^{2}-1}}$$ being radial symmetric and harmonic functions satisfying the important mean-value properties.  Going one step further, one can easily deduce the theorem for arbitrary weak solutions in $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathscr{L},\mu)$, at least after redefining such a function on a set of measure zero. (Note that any arcane reference's to ""appendix,"" ""text,"" etc. refers to Evan's PDE text, though this particular theorem does not appear in the text; not even as an exercise.) Proof. Let's first assume $u\in\mathscr{C}^{2}(\bar{U}).$  Then integration by parts (or Green's identity) shows
\begin{align*}
0
&=\int\limits_{U}u\Delta\phi\;dx\\
&=\int\limits_{\partial U}u\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial\nu}\;dS-\int\limits_{U}\nabla u\cdot\nabla\phi\;dx\\
&=-\int\limits_{\partial U}\phi\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}\;dS+\int\limits_{U}\phi\Delta u\;dx\\
&=\int\limits_{U}\phi\Delta u\;dx.
\end{align*}
Conversely, it is easy to see from the above that if $u$ is harmonic in $U$, then $u$ is also weakly harmonic.  Thus, being a weak solution to $\Delta u=0$ is equivalent to being a classical solution, at least when $u\in\mathscr{C}^{2}(\bar{U}).$  We now strengthen the assertion by assuming only $u\in\mathscr{C}(U)$ and mollifying $u$ (with the standard radial mollifier $\eta_{\epsilon}$ as defined in the appendix) in order to work again with a sufficiently smooth function.  To that end, let $\epsilon>0$ be given and define the set
$$U_{\epsilon}:=\{x\in U\;:\;\text{dist}(x,\partial U)>\epsilon\}.$$
(The set $U_{\epsilon}$ is obtained by cutting out a wedge of width $\epsilon$ along the perimeter of $U$).  Since the function $\eta_{\epsilon}(y)$ is supported on $B(0,\epsilon)$, we find that for any $x\in U_{\epsilon}$ fixed, $\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)$ is compactly supported in $U$ (in particular, on $B(x,\epsilon)$) and as such (as a function of $y$), $$\psi(y):=\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)\in\mathscr{C}^{\infty}_{0}(U).$$  For fixed $x\in U_{\epsilon}$, we then compute
\begin{align}
\Delta u_{\epsilon}(x)
&=\Delta_{x}(\eta_{\epsilon}\star u)\\
&=\Delta_{x}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)u(y)\;dy\\
&=\Delta_{x}\int\limits_{U}\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)u(y)\;dy\\
&=\int\limits_{U}\Delta_{x}\Big[\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)\Big]u(y)\;dy\\
&=\int\limits_{U}(-1)^{2}\Delta_{y}\Big[\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)\Big]u(y)\;dy\\
&=\int\limits_{U}u\Delta\psi\;dy\\
&=0.
\end{align}
Line 3 follows from $\text{supp}\{\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)\}\subset U$ as discussed above.  Differentiation under the integral sign in line 4 is justified by continuity of both $u$ and continuous differentiability of $\eta_{\epsilon}(x-y)$ as a function of $x$.  Line 5 follows from the chain rule, and finally line 7 follows from $u$ being a weak solution to $\Delta u=0$ and the previous remarks.  We have just proved that the mollified version of the weak solution to $\Delta w=0$ is a classical solution in the restricted domain $U_{\epsilon}$:
$$\int\limits_{U}u\Delta\phi\;dx=0\;\forall\;\phi\in\mathscr{C}^{\infty}_{0}(U)\Longrightarrow \Delta u_{\epsilon}=0\;\text{in}\;U_{\epsilon}$$
for all $\epsilon>0$.  We now show that this fact actually implies $\Delta u=0$ in $U$. Now choose $\epsilon'>0$ and put
$$u_{\epsilon\epsilon'}:=\eta_{\epsilon'}\star u_{\epsilon}.$$  Note that $\eta_{\epsilon'}(x-y)$ is supported on $U_{\epsilon}$ whenever $x\in U_{\epsilon+\epsilon'}$; in particular, for a fixed $x\in U_{\epsilon+\epsilon'}$, $\eta_{\epsilon'}(x-y)$ is supported on $B(x,\epsilon')$.  Since $\eta_{\epsilon'}$ is radial and $u_{\epsilon}$ is harmonic in $U_{\epsilon+\epsilon'}$ (and thus satisfies the mean-value properties there), for such $x$ fixed we compute in polar coordinates (as in Theorem 6 in the text)
\begin{align*}
u_{\epsilon\epsilon'}(x)
&=\int\limits_{U_{\epsilon}}\eta_{\epsilon'}(x-y)u_{\epsilon}(y)\;dy\\
&=\frac{1}{\epsilon'^{n}}\int\limits_{B(x,\epsilon')}\eta\left(\frac{|x-y|}{\epsilon'}\right)u_{\epsilon}(y)\;dy\\
&=\frac{1}{\epsilon'^{n}}\int\limits_{0}^{\epsilon'}\eta\left(\frac{r}{\epsilon'}\right)\left(\int\limits_{\partial B(x,r)}u_{\epsilon}(y)\;dS(y)\right)dr\\
&=\frac{u_{\epsilon}(x)n\alpha(n)}{\epsilon'^{n}}\int\limits_{0}^{\epsilon'}r^{n-1}\eta\left(\frac{r}{\epsilon'}\right)\;dr\\
&=\frac{u_{\epsilon}(x)}{\epsilon'^{n}}\int\limits_{B(x,\epsilon)}\eta\left(\frac{x-y}{\epsilon'}\right)\;dy\\
&=u_{\epsilon}(x)\int\limits_{B(0,\epsilon)}\eta_{\epsilon}(y)\;dy\\
&=u_{\epsilon}(x).
\end{align*}
Since convolution is associative, we find that for $x\in U_{\epsilon+\epsilon'}$,
$$u_{\epsilon'\epsilon}(x)=u_{\epsilon\epsilon'}(x)=u_{\epsilon}(x)\to u(x)\;\text{uniformly as}\;\epsilon\to0,$$
or
$$u(x)=u_{\epsilon'}(x).$$  From what was proven above, $u_{\epsilon'}$ is harmonic in $U_{\epsilon'}$, and therefore so is $u(x)$.  Sending $\epsilon'\to0$, we obtain the result for all $x\in U$, and conclude that weak solutions to Laplace's equation are in fact smooth solutions in the classical sense. QED (Here is an alternative argument to finish off the proof that $\Delta u=0$ in $U$, though it is not quite rigorous and may actually be incorrect): Now, $\Delta u_{\epsilon}\to0$ uniformly as $\epsilon\to0$ in any compact subset of $U$, and therefore, $\nabla u_{\epsilon}$ and $\nabla^{2}u_{\epsilon}$ must both converge uniformly to some limit in the same compact subset.  Consequently, since $u_{\epsilon}\to u$ pointwise for at least one $x\in U$ (in fact, uniformly for all $x$ in any $V\subset\subset U$), we find $\Delta u$ exists, and $$\Delta u=\lim_{\epsilon\to0^{+}}\Delta u_{\epsilon}=0$$ as required.","['harmonic-functions', 'partial-differential-equations', 'analysis']"

293662,product of measures and radon-nikodym,"$\mu, \nu$ measures $(X,M)$ with $\nu \ll \mu$ and $\lambda = \mu + \nu$. Show: $f=\frac{d\nu}{d\lambda}$ then $0 \leq f < 1$ $\mu$-a.e. and $\frac{d\nu}{d\mu} = \frac{f}{1-f}$. In our context a measure is positive if not stated differently. So in this case $\mu,\nu$ and $\lambda$ are positiv.
Let $A\in M$ with $\lambda(A)=0$ then it follows from $\lambda(A)=\mu(A)+\nu(A)=0$ that $\nu(A) =0$ and therefore it is $\nu \ll \lambda$ (and also $\mu \ll \lambda$). Then according to Radon-Nikodym it follows $\nu(A) = \int_A f d\lambda$. That $f \geq 0$ $\mu$-a.e. follows from $\mu \ll \lambda$ and $0 < \nu(A) = \int_A f d\lambda$ for all $A$ (therefore $f \geq 0$ $\lambda$-a.e.). For the second part I tried proof by contradiction.
Assume $\mu(A) > 0$ and $f(x) > 1$ for all $x\in A$.
From $\lambda(A) = \mu(A) + \nu(A)$ it follows then, that $\lambda(A) > 0$. Then $\nu(A) = \int_A f d\lambda > \int_A 1 d\lambda = \lambda(A)$. So that $\lambda(A) = \mu(A) + \nu(A) > \mu(A) + \lambda(A)$ which contradicts $\mu(A) > 0$. But then how to show the last part? Since $\nu \ll \mu$ it is (already proven) $\frac{d\nu}{d\lambda} = \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\cdot\frac{d\mu}{d\lambda}$ So
$\int_A f\cdot\frac{1}{1-f} d\mu \overset{!}{=} \nu(A) = \int_A \frac{d\nu}{d\lambda} d\lambda = \int_A \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\cdot\frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} d\lambda$ So I need to show $1-f=\frac{d\lambda}{d\mu}$ (since $\lambda \ll \mu$ and $\mu \ll \lambda$ it is proven that $\frac{d\lambda}{d\mu} = \left( \frac{d\mu}{d\lambda} \right) ^{-1}$) $\int_A 1-f d\mu = \mu(A) - \int_A \frac{d\nu}{d\lambda}d\mu = \cdots$","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Let $O_K$ be a dvr with maximal ideal $\mathfrak p$, $K$ its fraction field and $k$ its residue field. Let $p\geq 0$ be the characteristic of $k$. Let $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension. Let $O_L$ be the integral closure of $O_K$ in $L$; this is a free $O_K$-module of rank $[L:K]$.   We say that $L/K$ is tamely ramified if for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak q$ of $O_L$ lying over $\mathfrak p$, we have $$ (e_{\mathfrak q/\mathfrak p},p) = 1$$ and $l/k$ is separable, where $l$ is the residue field of $\mathfrak q$. for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak q$ of $O_L$ lying over $\mathfrak p$, we have that $p$ does not divide the order of the inertia group of $\mathfrak q$. for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak q$ of $O_L$ lying over $\mathfrak p$, we have that $l/k$ is separable and $p$ does not divide the degree of $L$ over the maximal unramified extension of $K$ in $L$. Are 1, 2 and 3 really equivalent? 1 implies 2 is trivial once you know that the order of the inertia group at $\mathfrak q$ is $e_{\mathfrak q/\mathfrak p} [l:k]_{insep}$. For 2 implies 1, you need that if $p$ does not divide $[l:k]_{insep}$, then $l/k$ is separable. Why is this true? For 2 implies 3, you need again that $l/k$ is separable under the assumption that $p$ does not divide $[l:k]_{insep}$ and you need that $e_{\mathfrak q/\mathfrak p}$ equals the degree of $L$ over the maximal unramified extension of $K$ in $L$. For 3 implies 1 you need the same. Is the above notion really the correct notion of $L/K$ tamely ramified? Is there also a notion of $L/K$ is tamely ramified at $\mathfrak q$?

I can construct maps from $\Gamma^0(E)$ to $C^0(M, \mathbb{R}^k)$ and vice-versa by choosing a trivializing cover $\big(U_i\big)_{i = 1}^m$ for $E$ and a partition of unity $\big(\rho_i\big)_{i = 1}^m$ associated to it and then decomposing/gluing a section in the obvious way. But these maps don't seem to be inverses of each other in general, although under some special conditions they are. I can give more details later, if required. Thanks in advance!","['topological-vector-spaces', 'vector-bundles', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $L$. For a prime $b$ of $B$, let $e_b$ be its ramification index and $f_b$ its residue degree. Do we have that $e_b$ and $f_b$ are independent of $b$? I'm thinking about the topological point of view. When you have a topological covering $X\to X/G$ obtained by a free action of a finite group on a compact connected Riemann surface, you have that all ramification indices of points lying over a fixed point are equal.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

293921,Combinatorics and Probability Problem,"The problem I am working on is: An ATM personal identification number (PIN) consists of four digits, each a 0, 1, 2, . . . 8, or 9, in succession. a.How many different possible PINs are there if there are no restrictions on the choice of digits? b.According to a representative at the author’s local branch
of Chase Bank, there are in fact restrictions on the choice
of digits. The following choices are prohibited: (i) all four
digits identical (ii) sequences of consecutive ascending or
descending digits, such as 6543 (iii) any sequence start-ing with 19 (birth years are too easy to guess). So if one of the PINs in (a) is randomly selected, what is the prob-ability that it will be a legitimate PIN (that is, not be one of the prohibited sequences)? c. Someone has stolen an ATM card and knows that the first
and last digits of the PIN are 8 and 1, respectively. He has
three tries before the card is retained by the ATM (but
does not realize that). So he randomly selects the $2nd$ and $3^{rd}$
digits for the first try, then randomly selects a different pair of digits for the second try, and yet another randomly selected pair of digits for the third try (the
individual knows about the restrictions described in (b)
so selects only from the legitimate possibilities). What is
the probability that the individual gains access to the
account? d.Recalculate the probability in (c) if the first and last digits are 1 and 1, respectively. --------------------------------------------- For part a): The total number of pins without restrictions is $10,000$ For part b): The number of pins in either ascending or descending order is $10 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$, because once the first digit is known, then the three other spots containing digits are already spoken for. The number of pins where each slot contains the same digit is $10 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$, because once the first digit is known there is only one option left to the rest of the slots. The number of pins that have their first and second slot occupied by 1 and 9, respectively, is $1 \cdot 1 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot$. So, if R is the set that contains these restricted pins, then $|R| = 130$; and if N is the set that contains the non-restricted ones, meaning R and N are complementary sets, then $|N| = 10,000 - 130$. Hence, the probability is then $P(N) = 9780/10000 = 0.9870.$ However, the answer is $0.9876$. What did I do wrong? For part c): The sample space, containing all of the outcomes of the experiment that will take place, is $|N|=9870$. When it says that the thief won't use the same pair of digits in each try, does that not allow him trying the pin 8 5 2 1 in one try and the pin 8 2 5 1 in another try?","['statistics', 'permutations', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

293942,Is this a correct way to calculate $\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x\sin(\pi x)}{x^2+2x+5}dx?$,"I have this integral to calculate: $$I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x\sin(\pi x)}{x^2+2x+5}dx.$$ I think I have done it, but I would like to make sure my solution is correct. I take the function $$f(z)=\frac{ze^{i\pi z}}{z^2+2z+5}$$ for $z\in\Bbb C.$ Now $$f(z)=\frac{z\cos(\pi z)}{z^2+2z+5}+i\frac{z\sin(\pi z)}{z^2+2z+5}$$ so $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x\cos(\pi x)}{x^2+2x+5}dx+i\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{x\sin(\pi x)}{x^2+2x+5}dx.$$ Therefore, to calculate $I$, I need to calculate the left-hand side and take the imaginary part of it. I consider contours $C_R$ composed of the upper half-circles $H_R$ of radius $R$ and the real interval $I_R=[-R,R]$. $f$ has two simple poles, $-1+2i$ and $-1-2i$, of which only $-1+2i$ lies in the upper half-plane. I have $$\mathrm{res}_{(-1+2i)}f=\frac{(-1+2i)e^{i\pi(-1+2i)}}{2(-1+2i)+2}=-\frac14(2+i)e^{-2\pi}.$$ Therefore, $$\int_{H_R} f(z)dz+\int_{I_R} f(z)dz=\int_{C_R} f(z)dz=2i\pi\cdot(-\frac14)(2-i)e^{-2\pi}=\frac\pi 2(1-2i)e^{-2\pi}.$$ $\int_{H_R} f(z)dz$ tends to zero as $R$ tends to infinity by Jordan's lemma. I have $$\begin{eqnarray}|\int_{H_R}f(z)dz|&\leq&\max_{\theta\in[0,\pi]}|\frac{Re^{i\theta}}{(Re^{i\theta})^2+2Re^{i\theta}+5}|\\&=&\max_{\theta\in[0,\pi]}\frac R{|(Re^{i\theta})^2+2Re^{i\theta}+5|}\\&\leq&\frac R{R^2-2R-5},\end{eqnarray}$$ by this . The last expression tends to zero as $R$ tends to infinity. $\int_{I_R} f(z)dz$ tends to $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx$ as $R$ tends to infinity. Therefore, $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(z)dz=\frac\pi 2(1-2i)e^{-2\pi}=\frac\pi 2e^{-2\pi}-i\pi e^{-2\pi},$$ whence $$I=-\pi e^{-2\pi}.$$","['improper-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

294011,"Simple proof? If $x$ lies outside a compact convex set, there exists a $y$ closer to every point in the set than $x$.","This seems rather obvious intuitively, but I can't find a simple proof. If $C$ is a compact, convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $x \not \in C$, then there exists a point $y$ such that, for every $c$ in $C$, $\|c-y\| < \|c-x\|$. ( Related question asks to show that for every $x,c$ there exists such a $y$; this asks for a single $y$ that works for all $c$.) If it simplifies the proof, it's also interesting to prove the following instead: If $C$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $x$ is not in the convex hull of $C$, then there exists a $y$ such that, for every $c \in C$, $\|c-y\| < \|c-x\|$. Here's an argument that I think works for the second one, but might be a pain to formalize: Let $S$ be a separating hyperplane between $x$ and $C$. Take the intersection of $S$ with the ball centered at a point $c \in C$ with radius $\|x-c\|$. This is nonempty: Otherwise, $c$ must lie on the ""other side"" of $S$, a contradiction. Do this for every $c \in C$ iteratively; at each step, the argument holds, so we are left with a nonempty set of points $y$ that satisfy the criteria. The problem with the proof is formalizing this notion that $c$ must lie on the other side of $S$. Can anyone help me fix/finish the proof, or suggest a better one? Also, I don't think this proof will extend easily to the first case, so that would be interesting to consider as well.","['convex-analysis', 'analysis']"
