1416363,Is there a name for this property of multiplication (and other functions)?,"Suppose $x,y \in \mathbb{R_+}, x<y$, and $ 0 < \varepsilon \leq (y-x)/2$. It seems to me that $xy < (x+\varepsilon)(y-\varepsilon)$ and equivalently that  $(x+\varepsilon)(y-\varepsilon)$ is strictly increasing in epsilon for $ 0 \leq \varepsilon \leq (y-x)/2$. Is there a name for this property? More generally, is there a name for this kind of property of a function where moving the inputs closer together while preserving their sum (or perhaps preserving some other analogous property) increases the function? **Edited from previous error:**As example of a similar (but opposite) property, it looks like the euclidean norm of a two dimensional vector (this probably could be extended to higher dimensions)  is decreasing as the coordinates are brought closer together while keeping their sum (i.e. the taxicab norm) constant. It seems like this has something to do with convexity but I'm not sure what the relationship is and if it is directly related or more of an analogy.","['arithmetic', 'functions']"
1416364,Set theory: Symmetric Difference properties.,"I would like to know if my procedure was correct in proving the next property ($\oplus \equiv$ symmetric difference): $$(A_1\cup A_2)\oplus (B_1\cup B_2)\subset (A_1\oplus B_1)\cup (A_2\oplus B_2)$$ Proof: $$Let\ x\in(A_1\cup A_2)\oplus (B_1\cup B_2)$$ $$i.e.\ x\in(A_1\cup A_2)\setminus (B_1\cup B_2)\ \lor\ x\in(B_1\cup B_2)\setminus(A_1\cup A_2)$$ $$i.e.\ [x\in(A_1\cup A_2)\ \land\ x\notin(B_1\cup B_2)]\ \lor\ [x\in(B_1\cup B_2)\ \land\ x\notin(A_1\cup A_2)]$$ $$i.e.\ [(x\in A_1\lor x\in A_2)\land(x\notin B_1\land x\notin B_2)]\ \lor\ [(x\in B_1\lor x\in B_2)\land(x\notin A_1\land x\notin A_2)]$$ $$i.e.\ (x\in A_1\land x\notin B_1\land x\notin B_2)\lor(x\in A_2\land x\notin B_1\land x\notin B_2)\ \lor\ (x\in B_1\land x\notin A_1\land x\notin A_2)\lor (x\in B_2\land x\notin A_1\land x\notin A_2)$$ so, particularly, we have $$\Rightarrow (x\in A_1\land x\notin B_1)\lor(x\in A_2\land x\notin B_2)\lor(x\in B_1\land x\notin A_1)\lor(x\in B_2\land x\notin A_2)$$ and, since $\lor$ is asociative, we have $$\Rightarrow ((x\in A_1\land x\notin B_1)\lor(x\in B_1\land x\notin A_1))\lor((x\in A_2\land x\notin B_2)\lor(x\in B_2\land x\notin A_2))$$ $$i.e.\ (x\in A_1\setminus B_1\ \lor\ x\in B_1\setminus A_1)\lor(x\in A_2\setminus B_2\ \lor\ x\in B_2\setminus A_2)$$ $$i.e.\ (x\in A_1\oplus B_1)\lor(x\in A_2\oplus B_2)$$
$$i.e.\ x\in (A_1\oplus B_1)\cup (A_2\oplus B_2)$$ therefore $(A_1\cup A_2)\oplus (B_1\cup B_2)\subset (A_1\oplus B_1)\cup (A_2\oplus B_2)$. There's also another way using this result:

1416382,On the proof of lemma 1.2.4 of Stroock and Varadhan A question concerning stopping times,"In the book Multidimensional diffusion processes , of Stroock and Varadhan one reads (page 23): This is the proof of $(i)$ .

Is it $\{A \cap \{\tau \leq t\}\mid A \in \mathcal{F}_t\}$ ?
Why do we consider such a sigma algebra instead of $\mathcal{F}_t$ ? after proving $(ii)$ the authors say (page 24) The proof of $(iii)$ is readily seen by the following reasoning: $$A \in \mathcal{F}_{\sigma}: \quad A \cap \{\tau \leq t\}  =A \cap \{\sigma \leq t\} \cap \{\tau \leq t\}  \in \mathcal{F}_t \Rightarrow A \in\mathcal{F}_{\tau}. $$ But I can't see why this result follows from $(ii)$ Using $(ii)$ the sole thing I arrived at was $$A \in \mathcal{F}_{\sigma}: \quad A =A \cap \{\sigma \leq \tau\}  \in \mathcal{F}_{\tau \wedge \sigma} = \mathcal{F}_{\sigma}, $$ which is not the desired result.

I tried to write $f(2x) = g(x)h(x)$ so that $f(x) = g(\frac{x}{2})h(\frac{x}{2})$ which are polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Then if $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ then maybe somehow $g(\frac{x}{2})$ and $h(\frac{x}{2})$ are both in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ too?

Regardless of whether or not the subset is also an empty set, the ""empty set"" still contains a subset, so how is it really ""empty""?

Then I divided into two cases where $f$ is not one-one but onto and $f$ is one-one but NOT onto. Case 1: Suppose f is not one-one but onto. We can show that the number of elements in $X$ is strictly larger than the number of elements in $Y$. But there will be no such function $g:Y\to X$ such that $g\circ f$ is the identity function on $X$, a contradiction. My question: I am not sure how to proceed with the second case.

I'm starting with a class of a given size and a group of a giving size, and trying to create a set of groupings such that the groups are unique in each grouping. For example, if I had a class of 6 and a group size of 2, I'd want the pairings to be: 1: [A,B] [C,D] [E,F]

Its easy to find algorithms (they're even built into python itertools) for generating all permutations and combinations, but my goal is to eliminate huge numbers of those combinations, as I'm trying to generate a set of pairings in which there are no repeats (i.e. once ""A,B"" appears once, it should never appear again).

I've made some starts at code to generate these combinations, but it gets thorny and inefficient with lots of backing out when you realize you've backed yourself into a corner.

1416575,Uniqueness of covariant derivative in Do Carmo,"2.2 Proposition: Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold with an affine connection $\nabla$. There exists a unique correspondence which associates to a vector field $V$ along the differentiable curve $c:I\: M$ another vector field $\frac{DV}{dt}$ along $c$, called the covariant derivative of $c$ such that: a)$\frac{D}{dt}(V+W)=\frac{DV}{dt}+\frac{DW}{dt}$ b)$\frac{D}{dt}(fV)$=$\frac{df}{dt}V+f\frac{DV}{dt}$ c)If $V$ is induced by a vector field $Y\in \mathcal{X}(M)$, then $\frac{DV}{dt}=\nabla_{dc/dt}Y$. Proof: Let us suppose initially that there exists such a correspondence. Let $\sum v^jX_j$ denote a vector field $V$ in local coordinates, and where $X_j=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}$. By a) and b) then $$\frac{DV}{dt}=\sum_j\frac{dv^j}{dt}X_j+\sum_j v^j\frac{DX_j}{dt}$$ by c) and i) $$\frac{DX_j}{dt}=\sum_i \frac{dx_i}{dt}\nabla_{X_i}X_j$$ Therefore, $$\frac{DV}{dt}=\sum_j \frac{dv^j}{dt}X_j+\sum_{i,j}\frac{dx_i}{dt}v^j\nabla_{X_i} X_j$$ The expression above shows us that if there is a correspondence satisfying the condition of proposition 2.2, then such a correspondence is unique. So my question is why does producing the formula in local coordinates implies uniqueness. I just don't get Do Carmo's reasoning here.

*Fibonacci> highlightArtifact fibonacci Observation Interestingly all list saparators form a parabola somehow (the vertex is not always visible though). I couldn't stop thinking about this and asked myself why this happens. A coincidence can be ruled out, because the artifacts are visible everywhere when you scroll through the output (at least in the beginning, after a while the numbers become to big) and resizing the terminal window makes them grow. Some outgrow the terminal window, but new parabolas will form. Explanation (An attempt) Since the equation for (at least a part of) a parabola like that is $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ (coefficients and constant parts excluded, so, asymptotically), I assumed, that this growth must be found somewhere in the fibonacci series, too. The speed in which the numbers grow in length must be describable with a function of the form $\sqrt{x}$.

So, I want to show that $S=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z-1|<|z+i|\}$ is open. Geometrically it's the points above the line through $1-i$ and the origin. (Eh?)

I started to fiddle around with the triangle inequality $$|w-1|=|w-z+z-1|\leq |w-z|+|z-1|$$ and then figured I could set $0<r<|z+i|-|z-1|$, which then would yield $$|w-1|\leq |z+i|$$ but that isn't quite it.

I believe that I have proven via strong induction that the function $f$ obeys a simpler recursion from which part (A) follows, but is there a simpler closed-form expression for $f(n)$, e.g. involving logs and floor functions? Is the proof okay? Simplifying the Recursion Computing a few more terms in the sequence: $$\begin{align}

\end{align}$$ Function values are shown in blue when the corresponding function value in the line above has the same argument. This gives a simple guarantee that (A) is true. $f(8)$ is the first function value that does not have such a term when expanded. This avenue will not be pursued further. Further values (not shown) lead me to conjecture that values are repeated as many times as the greatest power of 2 that divides the number ($2$ is repeated once, 4 twice, and odd numbers do not appear to be repeated); otherwise, values ascend by $1$. This will be tested via strong induction, and will lead to a simpler recursion formula. To prove (A) formulate an Induction Hypothesis (IH) for positive integers $n$, suitable for use with strong induction. For all integers $m\le n$ such that $m=2^q-1,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}$ For all integers $m \le n$ such that $m=2^q,q\ge1$, have $f(m)=2^{q-1}+1$ For all other integers $m\le n$ express $m=2^q+r,r<2^q-1$, then $f(m)=2^{q-1}+f(r+1)$ For all $3\le m\le n$, have $1<f(m)<m$ The IH is clearly true for the base cases $n=1,n=2$. When proving the inductive step by evaluating $f(n+1)$ via the recursion rule in (1), three cases must be considered. Case 1: $n=2^q-2$ (IH.1 for $n+1$) $$\begin{align}

1417433,When is $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n^k}{3^n}$ an integer?,"The motivation for this was to find some nice expression for the sum $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{P(n)}{b^n}$$ where $P(n)$ is a polynomial and $b$ is a positive integer greater than 1. Clearly, it suffices to find sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n^k}{b^n}$ for integer k. If we set $b=2$, a simple translation and subtraction of the terms in the series shows that $f(k)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{n^k}{2^n}$ satisfies the recurrence relation $f(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}{k \choose i}f(i)$, producing the series $2,2,6,26,...$ ( A076726 in OEIS). If $b>2$, a similar argument shows that the recurrence is $$f(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{{k \choose i}f(i)}{b-1}$$ When b=3, the series is as follows: $\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{2},\frac{33}{8},15,\frac{273}{4},\frac{1491}{4},\frac{38001}{16},17295,...$ The series takes on integer values at strange places; the first several such values are 4, 8, 12, 13, 16, 20, 24, 32, ...

All powers of 2 larger than 2 that I've computed so far (up to 1024) are integers. The odd numbers that take on integer values are frequently separated by powers of 2; if I recall correctly, the next odd number after 13 is 77=13+64. Curiously, there appear to be $no$ integer values for $b>3$. Does anyone know why these patterns should occur? If nothing else, more data on these values would be great (the few programming languages I'm competent in weren't able to handle large numbers very well, and I've lost the data up to 1024 that I used to have).",['number-theory']

He could not get to the right formula but it seems that his reasoning is right. Please tell me what's wrong with his logic. He reasons as follows: 1.Slice a sphere into thin circles (or rings if you hollow them out) The sum of the circumferences of all the circles forms the surface area of the sphere. Since the formula of circumference is $2{\pi}R$, the sum of the circumferences would be $2{\pi}(R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_n)$ My son draws the radii beside each other and concludes that their sum would be equivalent to one-half of the area of the largest circle

Attempt 1)I need a way to express $E[X|\sigma(Y)]$ in terms of the joint distribution $(X,Y)$. Assuming they have joint density I am done since $E[X|\sigma(Y)]=\int x f(x,Y)dx\frac{1}{\int f(x,Y)dx}$ and $Y\stackrel{d}{=}Y'$ by marginalizing. For finite sigma algebras we can write $E[X|G]=\sum E[X|A_{j}]1_{A_{j}}$ where $G=\sigma(\{A_{j}\}^{n})$ and $A_{j}$ partition the probability space $\Omega$. So I was trying to relate this to the possibly infinite sigma algebra $\sigma(Y)$. If we can partition space S into generating sets $\{B_{j}\}_{\mathbb{N}}$ for $\mathcal{B}$, then $\sigma(Y)=\sigma(\{Y^{-1}(B_{j})\}_{\mathbb{N}})$ by measurability and so  $E[X|\sigma(Y)]=\sum E[X|Y^{-1}(B_{j})]1_{Y^{-1}(B_{j})}$.","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"
