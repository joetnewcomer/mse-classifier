1233048,Help me understand Gröbner basis result please,"I'm practicing a bit with Gröbner bases but I'm not understanding the following result I obtain from Mathematica: GroebnerBasis[{

 2 a[3]^2)
}, 
{x}] So here I'm computing the  Gröbner basis of the terms (2 a[1] - a[2] - a[3]) (a[2] - a[3])^4 and (a[2] - a[3])^2 (5 a[1]^2 - 5 a[1] a[2] + 2 a[2]^2 - 5 a[1] a[3] + a[2] a[3] + 
 2 a[3]^2) And I indicate that my only variable $x$. This is the result Mathematica returns: {(a[2] - a[3])^6, 
(2 a[1] - a[2] - a[3]) (a[2] - a[3])^4,

a[2] a[3] + 2 a[3]^2)} So the term (a[2] - a[3])^6 Has been added. But I don't understand this. I expected the basis of $2$ constants (since neither expression involves $x$ they are just constants) to just be the same again. I also don't understand how this result follows from the algorithm for computing a Gröbner basis, since the leading term of both expressions is just the whole expression, so when calculating their S-polynomials, wouldn't it just be $0$? Any explanation of why this is the result would be much appreciated. Thanks.","['groebner-basis', 'algebraic-geometry', 'mathematica', 'polynomials']"

This is a root of the following polynomial: $P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 9 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ (that can be found out by guessing - maybe there is a more efficient / universal way?) Therefore $ a  = \sqrt{2} + i$ is a root of $ R(x) = P(x^2) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 9 \in \mathbb{Q}[x] $ If I manage to prove that $R(x) $ is irreducible in $ \mathbb{Q}[x] $, it'll mean that the degree is 4. Eisenstein's criterion is of no use. Other way is to express $ R(x) $ as $ R(x) = (x - a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)(x- a_4) $, where $ a_i $ are in $ \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R} $ and show that all products of form $ (x- a_i)(x-a_j) $ are not from $ \mathbb{Q}[x] $ - but that's not very elegant.

The problem: Construct an explicit bijection $f:[0,1] \to (0,1]$, where $[0,1]$ is the closed interval in $\mathbb R$ and $(0,1]$ is half open. My Thoughts: I imagine that I am to use the fact that there is an injection $\mathbb N \to [0,1]$ whose image contains $\{0\}$ and consider the fact that a set $X$ is infinite iff it contains a proper subset $S \subset X$ with $\lvert S \rvert = \lvert X \rvert$ (because we did something similar in class). I also have a part of proof that we did in class that I believe is supposed to help with this problem; it states the following: Start with an injection $g: \mathbb N \to X$ and then define a set $S=F(X)$ where $F$ is an injective (but NOT surjective) function $X \to X$ with $F(x) = x$ if $x \notin \text{image}(g)$ and $f(g(k)) = g(2k)$ if $x=g(k) \in \text{image}(g)$.

1233259,About the construction of Quot-Schemes,"I am reading in the paper of Nitsure (link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0504590v1.pdf ) about the construction of the Quot-scheme $\mathrm{Quot}_{E/X/S}^{\Phi,L}$. After Lemma 5.4. they reduce to the case where $E$ is the pullback of a vector bundle on $S$ and $X=\mathbb{P}(V)$ is some projective space. I understand the proof of Lemma 5.4., and the lemma implies that we can assume $E$ as above. But how does the reduction to $X=\mathbb{P}(V)$ work? Is it true, that there is an isomorphism of functors $\mathrm{Quot}_{E/X/S}^{\Phi,L} \rightarrow \mathrm{Quot}_{E'/\mathbb{P}(V)/S}^{\Phi,L}$ when $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}(V)$ is a closed subscheme? At least there's a morphism from the right to the left by taking pullbacks. However, I don't see how an inverse would look like.
Or is there a closed embedding $\mathrm{Quot}_{E/X/S}^{\Phi,L} \rightarrow \mathrm{Quot}_{E'/\mathbb{P}(V)/S}^{\Phi,L}$ which would suffice as well? Here is some other idea: a quotient of $E$ on $X$ is the same as a quotient of the pushforward $i_{\ast}E$ on $\mathbb{P}(V)$. But is it guaranteed, that $i_{\ast}E$ is still a quotient of some $\pi^{\ast}W$?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'category-theory']"

1233294,Algorithm design for enumerating pairs of noncommuting elements up to conjugacy,"I am trying to write some Magma code that, given a group $G$, returns a list of pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y\in G$ such that $[x,y]\neq 1$ and such that every pair $(z,w)$ in the group with $[z,w]\neq 1$ is conjugate (disregarding order) to some $(x,y)$ output by the algorithm. I realized when I began that I have no idea of the computational cost of the various steps in the process. I would love to learn a lot about this, but to stay focused, I will ask a restricted question: Which of the following three algorithm designs will more efficiently solve the above problem? And how will the answer to this be affected by the group order? By number of conjugacy classes? Algorithm 1a Compute the action by conjugation of $G$ on the set $Sym^2 G$ of unordered pairs of elements of $G$. Restrict attention to the pairs that don't commute. Partition $Sym^2 G$ into orbits and select a representative from each orbit. Return these selections. Algorithm 1b Same as algorithm 1 except allow redundancy by working with the ordered pairs $G\times G$ instead of $Sym^2 G$. Algorithm 2 Decompose $G$ into conjugacy classes. Ignoring the singleton classes, select a representative $x$ from each class. For each representative $x$, compute the centralizer $H=Z_G(x)$. Compute the action of $H$ by conjugation on the complement $G\setminus H$. From each orbit of this action, select a $y$, and output $(x,y)$. Thoughts From a mathematical aesthetics point of view, for example if I were writing a proof, algorithm 1a would be the way to go, clearly . Both other algorithms will produce redundant lists containing $(x,y)$ and $(y',x')$ as separate outputs, where $x,x'$ and $y,y'$ are simultaneously conjugate (unless the group has a very special property). More fundamentally, the set of conjugacy orbits of unordered pairs is actually the thing I'm trying to get a hold of , so that algorithm 1a aims directly for it while the other two come at it from the side. But OTOH, if I were to try to generate this list by hand, I would absolutely choose algorithm 2. Both other algorithms force me to take hold of the set of pairs (ordered or unordered) all at once, which is quadratic in the group order, whereas algorithm 2 never requires me to contemplate any set bigger than the group itself at any one time. How would a computer fare with these questions? Is computing orbits of an action on a big set much harder than on a small set? How about computing all those centralizers? Does the need in algorithm 2 to partition $G$ into orbits of numerous different groups cause extra difficulties? What are the relevant issues? Thanks in advance.","['computational-algebra', 'magma-cas', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'algorithms']"

f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n \, e^{i n \pi x/k}\ ,
$$
where
$$
c_n = \frac{1}{2k} \int_{-k}^k f(y) \, e^{-i n \pi y/k}\, dy\ 
$$
Let $\xi_n = n \pi / k$ and $\Delta \xi_n = \xi_n - \xi_{n-1} = \pi/k$, then

\left( \int_{-k}^k f(y) \, e^{-i y \xi_n}\, d y \right) e^{i x  \xi_n } \Delta \xi_n.

\widehat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty  f(x)\, e^{-ix \xi} \,d x.

Everyone does this argument, but they never prove it. Even if a book says this argument is not rigorous, they never once give a counterexample. My Question is about the proof: Let $g(\xi)$ be absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}$ and continuous, but NOT compactly supported, for otherwise my question is trivial. Let $k > 0$, let $\xi_n = n/k$, and consider the Riemann sum 
$$
\sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty g(\xi_n)\Delta \xi_n
$$
where suppose that this infinite series is absolutely convergent for all $k > 0$.   Must it be true that
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{-\infty}^\infty g(\xi_n)\Delta \xi_n = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\xi) d \xi?

1233649,Does the power spectral density vanish when the frequency is zero for a zero-mean process?,"A wide-sense stationary random time series $\zeta(t)$ is characterized by its mean value and its autocovariance function, which in the Wiener–Khinchin theorem is equivalent to the Fourier transform of the power spectral density  $$\langle[\zeta-\langle\zeta\rangle][\zeta’-\langle\zeta\rangle]\rangle = \sigma^2 C(\tau)-\langle\zeta\rangle^2 = \frac 1{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty S(\omega)exp(-\omega\tau)d\omega$$ where $\sigma^2 C(\tau)$ is the autocovariance function with rms amplitude $\sigma$, $\tau = t – t’$ is the stationary variable for the time series, and $\langle\zeta\rangle$ is the mean value of $\zeta$.  The inverse Fourier transform of the autocovariance function is $$S(\omega) + 2\pi \langle\zeta\rangle^2\delta(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty C(\tau)exp(\omega\tau)d\tau$$ and consists of the absolutely continuous power spectral density   and the discontinuous line spectral component $2\pi \langle\zeta\rangle^2\delta(\omega)$ at $\omega = 0$ that only appears when the mean is non-zero. Conjecture: For a zero-mean random process, i.e. $\langle\zeta\rangle = 0$, it is conjectured that the power spectral density vanishes when the frequency is zero (i.e. $S(0) = 0$).  The conjecture rests on the physical interpretation of the zero frequency ($\omega = 0$) component of the spectrum.  The zero frequency term corresponds to the DC term in a time series, and the DC term represents the mean value.  If the random variable has a zero-mean then the DC term is zero and thus both the mean value $\langle\zeta\rangle$ and the spectrum must be zero at $\omega = 0$.  In fact, since the mean value is always contained in the discontinuous line spectral component $2\pi \langle\zeta\rangle^2\delta(\omega)$, the continuous portion of the power spectral density $S(\omega)$ must always be zero at $\omega = 0$ whether the mean is zero or not. Question: Is this conjecture true or false?","['probability-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'stationary-processes', 'stochastic-processes']"
1233656,"Albert, Bernard and Cheryl popular question (Please comment on my theory)","Here is the problem, I think that there is one point that makes the question ambiguous, I think they should explicitly say the reason why Albert knows that Bernard does not know the date. Case 1: The reason is because Bernard told him. Lets analyse this case, Bernard tell Albert ""I don't know when her birthday is"". Albert takes this into account and all that he can deduce is that the date is not May 19 or June 18. So he uses this information but it is still not enough. So he says this to Albert, all that Albert can deduce from the fact that Albert wasn't able to solve it is that the sate in question is not june 17. The problem tells us this info was enough for Bernard to conclude, so this means Bernard had the only other date with 17. so the date was August 17, of course Albert can make this same reasoning, so in fact the answer is August 17. Case 2: The reason why Albert knows Bernard doesn't know is because he can deduce this from the month of the date without any other extra communication ( the month of the date contains only numbers which are repeated in other dates). In this case when Albert says he does not know but he knows Bernard doesn't either the information he is giving is : the month is July or August. The problem says this is enough for Bernard to conclude which means the dates are either July 16, August 15 or August 17. When Bernard says that he now knows, Albert deduces this same information, and for him to be able to conclude the date must be July 16.","['education', 'logic', 'algebra-precalculus', 'soft-question']"

1233705,Book recommendation for Abstract Algebra [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Good abstract algebra books for self study (13 answers) Closed 9 months ago . Hello fellow members of Math StackExchange! Since this is my first post here, I should start with a little introduction of myself. I've recently finished the second year of math at university and I did fairly well in the classes I took this semester (multivariable calculus, intro differential equations, intro linear algebra, intro abstract algebra). Out of the math topics I've been exposed to, I found myself to be drawn more to discrete math (algebra being by far my favourite). For example, I loved the definition-theorem-proof pattern that the abstract algebra course this semester followed. The algebra course at my school was quite standard, following the groups-rings-fields path. We used Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications by Tom Judson. We did skip over some chapters in the book, but I will finish learning them in my own time because I'm taking the summer semester off. However, because I get four months off in the summer, I'm hoping to also learn from a more advanced textbook, which leads to the main question of the post: What do you think is a good second textbook for self-studying abstract algebra for someone who has taken a semester of algebra? I know algebra is a big topic, so I'm sorry for posing a potentially vague question. Also, I searched this question on the forum before and the posts that I came across seem to be for beginners, so hopefully this isn't a duplicate.

1233727,Working with finitely presented groups in GAP,"This is more of a question specifically about how GAP handles calculations with finitely presented groups rather than about group theory. I have several finite group presentations that I would like to do computations on using GAP. Suppose I have denoted one as G. For this example, suppose that by entering the command 'Size(G);', GAP takes approximately a minute to determine that G is of a large finite order. My understanding (please correct me if I am wrong) is that GAP determined this through a Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration of the trivial subgroup of G. Ultimately, I have other computations to perform on G which I have been approaching by creating a coset table of G (w.r.t. a particular subgroup H, although taking H to be the trivial subgroup is fine for my purposes), but the command 'CosetTable(G,H);' takes an absurdly long time to complete (for this example, absurdly long is defined to mean longer than 30 minutes). Is there any way to extract or directly access the coset table GAP generated for the trivial subgroup while computing 'Size(G);', or is there more going on behind the scenes that would make such a coset table useless? In particular, being able to trace the action of words in the free group on the generators of G make the output of 'CosetTable(G,H);' ideal for my research. Is this why it takes so long for GAP to generate this coset table, as it has to determine how the generators of G act on every coset of H, including when I define H to be the trivial subgroup of G?","['group-presentation', 'gap', 'finite-groups', 'combinatorics']"
1233811,When does a matrix have a cyclic decomposition and when a rational form?,"I'm reading Hoffman's ""Linear Algebra"" and this question comes to my mind: suppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space on a field $F$, and $T$ a linear operator on $V$, when does a matrix has Cyclic Decomposition, and when does it has a Rational Form? The Cyclic Decomposition Theorem (Hoffman, Thm 7.3) says: Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$
  and let $W_0$ be a proper $T$-admissible subspace of $V$. There exist
  non-zero vectors $a_1, \dots , a_r$ in $V$ with respective
  $T$-annihilators $p_1, \dots , p_r$ such that $V = W_0 \oplus
 Z(\alpha_1; T) \oplus \dots \oplus Z (\alpha_r ; T)$ ; So the Cyclic Decomposition exists iff there is a $T$-admissible proper subspace $W_0 \subsetneq V$ to start from. Then what is the the condition for $W_0$'s existence? A Rational Form is actually the Cyclic Decomposition with $W_0=\{0\}$. So does this mean the condition for the existence of a rational form is that $T$'s character values are all in field $F$? For example a $n\times n$ matrix $T$ on real number field $\mathbb R$ has a rational form, so long as all the characteristic values of $T$ are all real numbers?",['linear-algebra']

1233879,How to prove / disprove these conditional probability statements?,"I was browsing a well known technology board and someone posted a pretty standard question about conditional probabilities. As this happens to be the current subject of my lectures (just starting), I decided to take a swing at them and it turns out I have no idea what I'm doing, or what kind of proof (contradiction?) I should be using in these kinds of questions. I can show these are correct/incorrect with arbitrary numbers, but I have a gut feeling there are more succinct ways of showing truth. If P(a|b,c) = P(a), then P(b|c) = P(b) I get the feeling that this one is wrong, only because we can't assume c has no bearing on b with only the information that neither affects a. From my limited knowledge of conditional probability, I'm reading the first statement that a is independent from both b and c. I did this, where I assumed the implication was true, and got a contradiction. Nevermind, I made the assumption that P(a|b,c) = P(a) ==> P(a|b) = P(a) and P(a|c) = P(a), and I apparently can't do that? If P(a | b) = P(a), then P(a | b, c) = P(a | c) I believe this one is true, because if a and b are independent, then the probability of a, given two conditions - one of which doesn't affect it, and one that might - should just be the probability of a given the other condition (c). I also tried proving this one, but I kept going in a circle. I've tried contradiction approaches, but I'm not familiar enough with conditional probability to say something is for sure a contradiction (For example, before I realized the incorrect assumption I made on the first one, I assumed the second part was true and arrived at P(b|a,c) = P(b|c), which looks false, but because of the stuff about independence I can't be certain). Most of my 'technique' has revolved around using the definitions P(a|b) = P(a,b)/p(b) (expanded to) P(a|b,c) = P(a,b,c)/P(b,c) P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b) = P(b|a)P(a) Any help is appreciated, especially if you focus on the ""why"" of choosing a certain proof.","['probability', 'statistics']"

When we read Cantor's argument, we can see that he represents a real number as an infinite sequence of binary digits. Using this representation, he shows that real numbers are uncountable. An intuitive counter argument could be that maybe there is another type (perhaps incredibly strange) way of representation that would make it possible to count the real numbers. A kind of trick, like the typical one used to show the countability of rational numbers. One could thus be tempted to think that when representing real numbers as infinite sequences of binary digits, it is those representations that are uncountable, but that some other representation could be countable. It seems to me that this can be summed up like this: Is a proof of the countability of a set dependent on the representation its members in the proof?",['elementary-set-theory']

1234539,"Proof of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1}(a,b)$ is ample $\iff$ $a,b >0$.","I would like some help understanding the proof in $(\impliedby)$ direction. Hartshorne on page 156, Example 7.6.2 says: If $\mathcal{L}$ is an invertible sheaf on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ of type $(a,b)$, i.e. $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1}(a,b)$, with either $a<0$ or $b<0$, then by restricting to a fibre of the product $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, one sees that $\mathcal{L}$ is not generated by global sections. i.e. wlog let $a<0$. Then restricting to $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \{x\}$, we get a sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a)$, which is not generated by global sections, as it doesn't have any when $a<0$. That means $\mathcal{L}$ can not be very ample (since a very ample sheaf is always generated by finitely many global sections). In particular, by the same reasoning, no positive tensor power of $\mathcal{L}$ can be very ample. Finally, that implies that $\mathcal{L}$ can not be ample. If $a=0$, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a) = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}$, which is not ample, since by definition (Hartshorne p 153) a sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ is ample if for every coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ there is an integer $n_0>0$ such that for every $n \geq n_0$, the sheaf $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^n$ is generated by global sections. In our case $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}$ and take $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)$. It is well known that the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)$ is coherent, so we can use the above definition. So $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1) \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}^n$ is just $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)$ for any $n>0$, which is not globally generated. Hence, if $a \leq 0$ or $b \leq 0$, $\mathcal{L}$ can not be ample. Is the above correct? I think I'm using that the restriction of a globally generated sheaf to a subvariety is also globally generated. Similarly for very ample sheaves.","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

If I could show that $s|_{V_i}=0 \Rightarrow {t_j}_{V_i}=0$ then the problem would be done, because the $\cal{F}_i$ are sheaves, in particular they verify the first axiom of sheaves, so $t_j=0$ and then $s=f_j(t_j)=0$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

\end{align} Then $\mathcal{X}$ is a  projective variety of $P^5$ given by $7$ quadratic equations ($3$ for the Segre variety and $4$ for the image of the veronese variety). Next, let $C_4$ be the rational normal curve, which arises as the image of $P^1 \rightarrow P^4$ given by 
\begin{align}
[W_0 : W_1] \mapsto [W_0^4: W_0^3 W_1: W_0^2 W_1^2 : W_0 W_1^3 : W_1^4].
\end{align} $C_4$ is given by $4$ quadratic equations. Exercise 2.28 in Harris (AG-first course) says that $C_4$ can be realized as a hyperplane section of $\mathcal{X}$. I have been trying to see why this is true, by working with the pullback of $C_4$ under $\sigma$. More precisely, to prove the statement in Harris i would have to show that this pullback is given by the equation $Y_1^2 - Y_0Y_2=0$, which is the veronese variety, together with a bilinear form in $X_1,X_0$ (homogeneous coordinates of $P^1$) and $Y_0,Y_1,Y_2$ (homogeneous coordinates of $P^2$), which would correspond to a hyperplane in $P^5$. When i pull back the equations of $C_4$ i get: $(1): \, X_0^2(Y_1^2-Y_0 Y_2) = 0 \\
(2): \, X_0(X_0 Y_2^2 - X_1 Y_0 Y_1)=0 \\
(3): \, X_1(X_1 Y_0^2 - X_0 Y_1 Y_2)=0.$ Issue 1: The variety described by these equations does not entirely
live in the veronese variety (since equation (1) is multiplied by $X_0^2$). Issue 2: I am finding hard to
believe that equations (1)-(3) can give the same variety of $P^1 \times P^2$
as the one given by $Y_1^2-Y_0 Y_2=0$ together with a bilinear form. Question: How can these two issues be addressed?

1234615,Stochastic kernel as linear operator,"Let $K$ be a stochastic kernel for a set $S$ equipped with a countably generated $\sigma$-Algebra $B(S)$, i.e. $K:S\times B(S)\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $K(\cdot,A)$ is a measurable function for all $A\in B(S)$ and $K(x,\cdot)$ is a probability measure for all $x\in S$. Now $K$ operates linearly on $M_{1}(S)$, the space of probability measures on the measurable space $(S,B(S))$, by setting for all probability measures $\mu $ $K\mu := \int_S K(y,\cdot)\mu(dy)$. Question: Is the converse also true, that each linear operator on $M_{1}(S)$, the space of probability measures on $(S,B(S))$, gives us a
  stochastic kernel again? Each such linear operator O can be understood as mapping $O:S \times B(S)\rightarrow[0,1]$ $\hphantom{O:}(x,A)\mapsto (O\delta_x)(A)$, where $\delta_x$ is the Dirac-measure. So it basically boils down to the question if this last mapping is measurable in x, or if there are linear Operators on $M_{1}(S)$, so that the above mapping is not measurable in x. I try it like this : Every probability measure $\mu$ on $(S,B(S))$ can be written as: $\mu = \int_S  \delta_y \mu(dy)$ (I hope this is right, but I cannot remember having seen such an argument before), then we have $O\mu = O\int_S  \delta_y \mu(dy)=\int_S  O\delta_y \mu(dy)$ (last equality holds for finite sums because of the linearity of O, but I don't know why that is applicable to integrals). This cannot be defined, if $O\delta_y$ is not measurable as a function of $y$, it then follows $O\mu$ is no probability measure. Contradiction. Clarification: By linear operator $O$ I mean that for all $\mu,\nu\in M_{1}(S)$ and all $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$ we have $O(\alpha \mu + (1-\alpha)\nu)=\alpha O\mu + (1-\alpha)O\nu$ (thanks @ByronSchmuland for pointing this out).","['probability-theory', 'operator-theory', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes']"

I've been trying to go through the details of the sentence The proof of (6.10) shows that if $f \in K$ is invertible at $Z$, then the principal divisor $(f)$ on $X - Z$ has degree $0$. $X$ is the singular curve given by the homogeneous equation $y^2z = x^3$ in $\mathbb P^2$ and $Z$ is the singular point $[0,0,1]$. $K$ is the field of rational functions of $X$. (6.10) refers to the result that a principal divisor on a complete nonsingular curve has degree $0$. So first of all $X$ is not nonsingular, so I guess the idea is to relax all the statements involved and still get the proof. My main issue is that the morphism $X - Z \to \mathbb P^1$ is not finite (it is not proper and finite morphisms are). Everything in the section was about finite morphisms of curves with nonsingularity assumptions almost everywhere, so this is a pain. I understand that the morphism $\varphi : X \to \mathbb P^1$ obtained from the field extension $k(f) \subseteq K(X)$ will be finite and $X$ is complete, but then the map $\varphi^* : \mathrm{Div}(\mathbb P^1) \to \mathrm{Div}(X)$ assumes $X$ is nonsingular, and I don't see how to correctly get rid of the issue of the singular point. I thought about using the projection from a point $\mathbb P^3 \backslash \{*\} \to \mathbb P^2$ which sends a twisted cubic $C$ to this singular curve $X$, and since the induced morphism $C \to X$ is a bijection of sets, the induced morphism of complete nonsingular curves $C \to X \to \mathbb P^1$ would give me a Weil divisor on $C$, which I could pushforward to $X - Z$ using the fact that if $P \in C$ is the point which maps to $Z$, then the map $C \to X$ restricts to an isomorphism $C - P \to X - Z$, so I can push my Weil divisor of $C - P$ to $X - Z$.

1234992,Absolute value of complex Radon measure,"Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. To simplify matters we assume $X$ has a countable base. Let $\mathcal B$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the set of open subsets of $X$. A Borel measure on $X$ is a mesure defined on $\mathcal B$ such that $\mu(K) \lt \infty$ for every compact subset $K$.
We denote $\int_X f d\mu$ by $\mu(f)$ for an integrable function $f$.
Let $\mathcal L$ be the vector space over $\mathbb C$ of continuous complex valued functions of compact support defined on $X$. We denote by $\mathcal L_+$ the set of non-negative real valued contonuous function of compact support.
A linear functional $L: \mathcal L \rightarrow \mathbb C$ is called a positive linear functional if $L(f) \ge 0$ whenever $f\in \mathcal L_+$. By Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique Borel measure $\mu$ such that $L(f) = \mu(f)$ for every $f \in \mathcal L$. We identify $L$ with $\mu$.
A linear functional $L: \mathcal L \rightarrow \mathbb C$ is called a Radon measure if for every compact subset $K$ there exists a real number $M_K$ such that $|L(f)| \le M_K ||f||$ for every $f\in \mathcal L$ whose support is contained in $K$, where $||f|| = sup_{x\in X} f(x)$. It is known that a Radon measure $\mu$ can be written as $\mu = \mu_1 - \mu_2 + i(\mu_3 - \mu_4)$ where $\mu_1,\dots,\mu_4$ are positive Borel measures.
For a Radon measure $\mu$ we write $|\mu|(f) = sup_{|g| \le f} |\mu(f)|$ for $f\in \mathcal L_+$. It can be proved that $|\mu|$ is a Borel measure. $|\mu|$ is called the absolute value of $\mu$.
Let $\mu$ be a Radon meassure, $A$ a Borel set such that $|\mu|(A) \lt \infty$.
Are the following assertions true? 1) $|\mu|(A) = sup_{K\subset A} |\mu(K)|$. 2) $|\mu|(A) = sup |\mu(A_1)| + \cdots + |\mu(A_n)|$ where $A = \cup A_i$ is a finite disjoint union of Borel sets and the sup runs through such partitions. The motivation is that the assertions are true when $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure and 2) seems to be true when $\mu$ is bounded.",['measure-theory']
1235015,"Why is the conjugate momentum $p(x,x')=\partial_2 L(x,x')$ an element of the cotangent space?","Imagine we have a particle described by $x \in M$, where $M$ is some manifold, then it is very intuitive I think that a velocity is an element of the tangent space at $x$, so $x' \in T_{x}M.$ Thus, by definition of the tangent bundle, we have $(x,x') \in TM$. Now, in classical mechanics we learn that the conjugated mometum $p(x,x') = \partial_2L(x,x')$ and now I read that this guy is an element of the cotangent space, but I have no idea why. I mean, to be in the cotangent space, you need to take elements in the tangent space of $x$ which are velocities as arguments and only depend linearly on them. Although it is clear that p takes velocities as arguments which is alright, it is not clear to me at this moment why this should happen linearly. Is this an additional (physical) input at this point or is there a mathematical argument why the momentum is now a linear map?","['manifolds', 'mathematical-physics', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry']"

I'm curious as to whether this is a common proof. The proof in the book is very brief. It says this follows since localisation commutes with tensor products. I'm also interested in a more constructive proof. Vakil's notes contain a hint saying we can define an isomorphism on distinguished open subsets and on such subsets no need for sheafification.

Show also that $|\sin(z)| = \cosh(y)$ on the sides, use this to bound $| f(z) |$ by a constant there, and so bound $|f(z)|$ by a constant along the entire $C$ . My work: I was able to prove that $|\sin(z)| = \cosh(y)$ on the sides. I got that $|\sin(z)| = \sinh(y)$ on the top and bottom by the following $$\lvert \sin(x+iy)\rvert = \lvert \frac{e^{-i(x+iy)}-e^{i(x+iy)}}{2} \rvert \le \frac{e^{|y|}-e^{-|y|}}{2} = \sinh(y) = \sinh(|n|\pi)$$ I am unsure if this is correct, as I am unsure what the script $\mathcal O$ means.
