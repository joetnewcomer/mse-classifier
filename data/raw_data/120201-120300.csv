1796915,Can we describe nicely all the rational numbers of the form $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$?,"Let $\zeta$ be a primitive cubic root of unity, i.e., $\zeta$ is a complex number such that $\zeta^{3}=1$ and $\zeta\neq1$. Let us consider the Galois extension $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)/\mathbb{Q}$ (the Eisenstein field) and the norm map given by
\begin{equation}
N(a+b\zeta)=a^{2}-ab+b^{2},
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers. Since the norm defines a homomorphism on the multiplicative groups $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)^{\times}\to\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$, we know already that the image will be a multiplicative subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$. Can we describe this group nicely? I've tried putting some values and trying to figure out the form of this group inside $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$, but I can't really see a pattern going on. Taking primes $p\equiv 2\pmod3$, we can see that this norm map is not surjective, but I don't know the group $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ really well to know its subgroup structure. I'd guess that Global Class Field Theory gives an answer to this question, but I don't know much about it.

1796944,"How to ""rotate"" a function? Or, how to write a function which has a known, rotational symmetry with respect to another function?","EDIT 2: I've posted my ""real"" question here: https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/115766/finding-closed-form-eigenvalues-of-a-particular-matrix I have posed my question formally in LaTeX here: Formalized problem statement. But in words, here is my question. Suppose I have two real-valued functions in the real plane, $f$ and $g$. Moreover, I know that $g$ is given exactly by $f$, with its argument rotated by $2\pi/3$. In other words, given knowledge of $f$, we simply rotate the output by $2\pi/3$ to get $g$ everywhere. How can I formalize this additional information? I used a 2D rotation matrix to find the corresponding argument of $\{x,y\}$ rotated by $2\pi/3$, but I still do not know how to write function $g$ in terms of $f$. In my full problem, I have a system of nonlinear equations which involve both $f$ and $g$ and I wish to incorporate the rotational symmetry information to reduce the complexity and allow me to determine these functions. EDIT: I began by asking a simpler question than I ultimately want to know, which is how to replace g by some function of f . Suppose I have a nonlinear system of equations which involve f and g , how can I eliminate g from these equations, given that I essentially "" know "" what g is due to it's symmetry with respect to f ?","['symmetry', 'rotations', 'functions']"

1797211,How do linear operators acting on paths of Gaussian processes influence the covariance function?,"It is well-known that applying a linear transformation $A$ on an $n$-dimensional centered Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix $\Sigma$ results in another centered Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix $A\Sigma A^T$. I am interested in generalisations of this property for Gaussian processes.

Intuitively, I would guess that $T(X)$ is again a centered Gaussian process, which could be proved by looking at the finite-dimensional distributions of the process, if I'm not mistaken. The question is now, what can be said about the covariance function of $T(X)$ given the covariance function of $X$, e.g. something similar to the ""$A\Sigma A^T$""-expression above?

1797554,Proving that a sphere has a minimal surface to volume ratio using Calculus of Variations,"I know the problem is traditionally solved via the isoperimetric inequality, but I was hoping to solve it by minimizing a surface of revolution subject to a volume constraint. The surface area of a surface of revolution is: $$A=2\pi\int_{-1}^{1}y\sqrt{1+\dot{y}^2}~dx$$ and the volume will be: $$V=\pi\int_{-1}^{1}y^2~dx$$ I'd like to show that the sphere (or in this case the function $x^2+y^2=1$) minimizes the surface area functional for any fixed volume. The combined action will then be: $$S=\int_{-1}^{1}2\pi y\sqrt{1+\dot{y}^2}+\lambda\pi y^2 dx$$ The Euler Lagrange Equation simplifies to: $$-\frac{2 \pi  y'(x)^2}{\sqrt{y'(x)^2+1}}+2 \pi  \sqrt{y'(x)^2+1}+\frac{2 \pi 
   y(x) y'(x)^2 y''(x)}{\left(y'(x)^2+1\right)^{3/2}}-\frac{2 \pi  y(x)
   y''(x)}{\sqrt{y'(x)^2+1}}+2 \pi  \lambda  y(x)=0$$ I have no clear idea how to proceed from here. I can solve for $\lambda$ using Mathematica, and get $$\lambda=\frac{y(x) y''(x)-y'(x)^2-1}{y(x) \left(y'(x)^2+1\right)^{3/2}}$$ The ODE solution is extremely convoluted, involving about half a dozen elliptic integrals, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Is there something fundamentally wrong with my approach, or is there an obvious next step in the problem? EDIT: Using the Beltrami identity instead, and reversing the problem so the volume is varied and a constant surface area is the constraint, the EL equation can be simplified to: $$y(x)^2+\frac{2\lambda y(x)}{\sqrt{y'(x)^2+1}}=k$$ Which, while much simpler, doesn't get me closer to an answer. If $k$ is equal to $0$ and $y(0)$ is likewise, then the ODE reduces nicely, and can be solved. One solutions is: $$y(x)=\sqrt{4 \lambda ^2-x^2}$$ Which is the equation of a circle (which when rotated around the axis becomes a sphere). However, some assumptions are made there which are not necessarily true.","['optimization', 'calculus-of-variations', 'constraints', 'differential-geometry']"
1797582,Is there a way to determine the cheapest way to cut a line if each cut costs the current length of a line?,"I was reading through an example question for the UNSW Computing ProgComp and found a question they claimed to be impossible to solve without going through all possible solutions. From https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pop.php?loc=2014opentasks#task5 : You have a length of timber that needs to be cut into several pieces. The points where the cuts have to be made are marked on the timber, measured from one end. The only precision cutting company available at short notice charges, for each cut, a rate in dollars equal to the length of the piece (being cut) in metres before cutting. The order in which the cuts occur affects the total price. For example, a piece 10m long with cuts needed at 4m, 5m and 7m could be cut first at 5m, costing \$10, leaving two 5m sections requiring one cut each, a total of \$10 + \$5 + \$5 = $20. However if the cuts are made at 4m, 7m and 5m the total cost is \$10 + \$6 + \$3 = $19."" ... There is no shortcut computational strategy that can generate the optimal cost in all cases, though heuristics may work sometimes. Instead you should try all possible cut sequences. Small-scale problems can be solved by a simple recursive design, but will take an inordinate amount of time for larger numbers of cuts as the number of small, repeated subproblems escalates exponentially. Solving large problems of this kind requires a technique called dynamic programming , where the the first time each small subproblem is solved, the solution is stored in an array or hash, representing a solution cache. When the same subproblem needs to be solved again the cache is first inspected, thus avoiding possibly thousands of recalculations. While as a programming problem it would be easy to go through all the possible solutions, I'm curious to see if there's a way to do so mathematically.",['geometry']

Let $a_n$ be the size of $S_n$. Note that, because some subsets of $S_{n-1}$ may have identical mean values, $a_n$ may be less than the number of non-empty subsets of $S_{n-1}$ (that is, $2^{a_{n-1}}-1$). For example, at the $1^{\text{st}}$ step we get the subsets $\{\{0\},\,\{1\},\,\{0,1\}\}$, and their means are $\{0,\,1,\,1/2\}.$ So $S_1=\{0,\,1,\,1/2\}$ and $a_1=|S_1|=3.$ At the $2^{\text{nd}}$ step we get the subsets $\{\{0\},\,\{1\},\,\{1/2\},\,\{0,\,1\},\,\{0,\,1/2\},\,\{1,\,1/2\},\,\{0,\,1,\,1/2\}\},$ and their means are $\{0,\,1,\,1/2,\,1/2,\,1/4,\,3/4,\,1/2\}.$ So, after removing duplicate values, we get $S_2=\{0,\,1,\,1/2,\,1/4,\,3/4\}$ and $a_2=|S_2|=5.$ And so on.

I understand that this integral comes from an integral over an infinite arc of radius $R$ on the upper-half plane (where the integral goes to zero for $R\to\infty$) plus the real line (after taking the limit $\epsilon\to 0$). Assuming the integrand goes to zero faster than $x^{-1}$ and considering the residue theorem, we get the result: $
\lim_{\epsilon\to0^+}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x-x_0\pm i\epsilon}dx=2\pi i \text{Res}[f;x_0].
$ Now, if we take the minus sign for $i\epsilon$ and send $\epsilon$ to 0 (without calculating the integral) the above equation yields $2\pi if(x_0)$, while the plus sign yields 0. What is the problem here? Is this related to the fact I can't commute the limit with the integral sign in this case, i.e. $
\lim_{\epsilon\to0^+}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x-x_0\pm i\epsilon}dx\neq\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{f(x)}{x-x_0}dx?

1798383,Integer Partition Refinement in Sage,"A partition of an integer $n$ is a non-decreasing list of positive integers summing to $n$. For example, $3$ can be partitioned as $1 + 1 + 1$, $1 + 2$ or just $3$, but $2 + 1$ is indistinct from $1 + 2$ (e.g.,  order does not matter). A refinement of a partition $P$ of $n$ is (I hope I'm using this term correctly) another partition of $n$ obtained by further partitioning the elements of $P$. That definition is a little loose, but I hope an example will clarify. The partitions $(1,1,1,3)$ and $(1,1,2,2)$ both refine $(3,3)$, since they are each obtained by partitioning the elements of $(3,3)$. By contrast, $(2,4)$ is also a partition of $6$, but it does not refine $(3,3)$. (Notice refinement induces a poset structure on the collection of partitions of an integer.) Given a particular partition $P$ of $n$, is there a built-in function in Sage to iterate over all refinements of $P$? For example, iterating over the refinements of $(2,3)$ should produce something like the list $(2,3)$, $(1,2,2)$, $(1,1,3)$, $(1,1,1,2)$, $(1,1,1,1,1)$. I see how one could build such a function ""from scratch"" (list all partitions for each entry and just stitch them together), but I wonder if there is something hidden in a number theory or lattice/poset theory package that I'm not aware of. Alternate Goal : For my purposes, I would even be happy with the ability to efficiently check whether one integer partition refines another (as opposed to returning the list of all such refinements). Update : Some evidence that this problem is hard in general and a suggested solution via integer linear programming.","['sagemath', 'integer-partitions', 'number-theory', 'order-theory', 'combinatorics']"

1798474,When does the dual of $s =s$?,"Why I believe this is not a duplicate: This question might be the same, but the accepted answer is only a partial answer, because it gives no reason as to why those are the only solutions. Since the answer is accepted, that question will likely not receive any further answers. I would like to reopen this question in order to place a bounty and hopefully get a more complete answer. When does $s^*=s$? $s^*$ represents the dual of $s$, where $s$ is a compound proposition involving only $T, F, \wedge, \vee, \neg $, and $s^*$ is obtained by interchanging $T$ for $F$, $F$ for $T$, $\wedge$ for $\vee$, and $\vee$ for $\wedge$. A big obstacle is that question is from the $2^{nd}$ section of chapter $1$ of a $2000^-level discrete math book, so we are not even introduced to induction. I don't even know what sort of tools I'm supposed to use to solve this. What I've tried: First, I drew up some truth tables of compound prepositions and their duals to look for any patterns, and what I noticed  (in the few examples that I tried) was that the number of ""True"" outputs of $s$ was equal to the number of ""False"" outputs from $s^*$. For example, if $s$ was a compound proposition of $p, q, r$ and $s$ was true in $5$ cases and false in $3$, $s^*$ was false in $5$ cases and true in $3$ (they didn't match up though). I think that if $a=b$, then $a^*=b^*$. I'm not sure how to prove this or if it's even necessary to prove it, but I suspect it's true. If it is, then at least $s^*=s$ holds for compound propositions $s$ which can be simplified to a single proposition. For example $s=(p \vee F) \wedge (q \vee T)=p$, therefore $s=p=p^*=s^*$. I know that in the definition of ""dual"" $s$ has to be a compound proposition; but as an exercise, the book asked to find the dual of this $s$ so I guess it's valid. If this is the only time when $s^*=s$, then I was thinking we can prove this by induction (even though we're probably not supposed to use it.) We know that if $s$ reduces to $p \wedge q$ or to $p \vee q$, then $s^* \ne s$, and then maybe we could use induction to show that if it reduces to a simpler proposition of $n+1$ variables, $s^*=s$ also doesn't hold.","['propositional-calculus', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

$$det({\mathbf{A}}) = \infty $$
then
$$ det({\mathbf{A}^{-1}}) = 0 $$ Therefore, the inverse of ${\mathbf{A}}$ is not invertible (This apparent contradiction is what is bugging me).

1798941,statistical tolerance limits,"My Question is: What statistical methods can be used to examine whether a selection of tolerance limits of data makes sense, i.e. validation of tolerance limits? My solution: I would analyse how many outliers exist (data greater than the tolerance limit), how they are distributed (>>tolerance limit oder low deviation from the tolerance limit), comparison of mean, quantiles, standard deviation of data (which allow statements about curtosis,skewness etc.). But I'm not sure in which cases one can say that a stated tolerance limit makes sense. There is no optimal tolerance limit. So my Questions summarized: (1) Which statistical methods exist to validate a stated tolerance limit? (2) What should be the ""desired goal/result"" of these statistical tests of validation?","['descriptive-statistics', 'statistics']"
1798954,What is the limit distribution of $\frac{S_{N_n}}{\sigma \sqrt{a_n}}$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.,"Let $X_1, X_2, X_3,...$ be iid with $\mathbb E[X_i]=0$ and $\operatorname{Var}[X_i]=\sigma^2>0$, and let $S_n = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. Let $N_n$ be a sequence of integer valued random variables independent of $X_i$, $i \geq 1$, and let $a_n$ be a sequence of positive integers with $\frac{N_n}{a_n}\rightarrow 1$ in probability and $a_n\rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. What is the limit distribution of $\frac{S_{N_n}}{\sigma \sqrt{a_n}}$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. It looks like a CLT question but now I have trouble dealing with the ${S_{N_n}}$, besides I didn't use the condition ""$\frac{N_n}{a_n}\rightarrow 1$ in probability"". Any hints will be appreciated.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-theory', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1798956,Show that the square of any prime number is the Factof of some integer,"This is a very interesting word problem that I came across in an old textbook of mine. So I know its got something to do with prime numbers, but other than that, the textbook gave no hints really and I'm really not sure about how to approach it. So anyway, here the problem goes: The $\text{Factof}$ (Integer on number of factors) of an integer is the integer divided by the number of factors it has. For example, $18$ has $6$ factors so $\text{Factof}(18) = \frac{18}{6} = 3$ , and $27$ has $4$ factors so $\text{Factof}(27) = \frac{27}{4} = 6.75$ . Show that the square of any prime number is the $\text{Factof}$ of some integer. Edit: I have reworded the question so that it is more specific and can be answered coherently in the context of the rules.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1798967,Deck of cards probability with exclusion,"What is the probability that a hand of five cards has exactly one club or exactly one heart So my logic was to select all possibilities with one club + all possibilities with one heart - possibilities with one heart and one club, divided by all possible hands and ended up with $\frac{(2*{13 \choose 1}{39\choose 4})-{13 \choose 1}{13 \choose 1}{26 \choose 4}}{52 \choose 5}$ edit: this seems really small so it is
${(2*{13 \choose 1}{39\choose 4})-{13 \choose 1}{13 \choose 1}{26 \choose 4}}$ divided by ${52 \choose 5}$ Is this correct? and if so is it possible to simplify this?","['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I tried assuming that the sequence $a_1^m, a_2^m,...$ forms a geometric progression, because that is the only type of infinite series that I know how to evaluate. I know my attempt doesn't work for all integers $m$, but it does work for $m=1$: Let $a_1=\dfrac 12$ and $a_n=a_1^n$ We have $a_1^m+a_2^m+a_3^m+...=(a_1)^m+(a_1^2)^m+(a_1^3)^m+...= \left( \dfrac 12 \right)^m+ \left(\dfrac 12 \right)^{2m}+ \left(\dfrac 12 \right)^{3m}+...=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( \dfrac 12 \right)^{i \cdot m}=m$ Now if we let $m=1$, we have $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( \dfrac 12 \right)^{i}=\dfrac {\dfrac 12}{1-\dfrac 12}=1$","['algebra-precalculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
1799011,What is $\lim_{x\to \infty} 2\sqrt{x}- \sum_{n=1}^x {1\over \sqrt{n}}$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Evaluate: $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left({2\sqrt n}-\sum_{k=1}^n\frac1{\sqrt k}\right)$ (4 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I ask this because I noticed the partial sum $\sum_{n=1}^x {1\over \sqrt{n}}$ is very close to $2\sqrt{x}$, so close in fact that it appears their difference approaches a constant value, like $H_x$ and $\ln x$. However, when I put this limit as is into Wolfram, it said the limit diverged. But, I found a way to transform the limit into an infinite sum, by using the transformation $f(x) = f(0) + \sum_{n=1}^x f(n) - f(n-1)$, an application of telescoping series to partial sums. Thus,
\begin{align*}\lim_{x\to \infty} \left(2\sqrt{x}- \sum_{n=1}^x {1\over \sqrt{n}} \right) &= 
\lim_{x\to \infty} \left( 2\sqrt{0} + \sum_{n=1}^x \left( 2\sqrt{n} - 2\sqrt{n-1} \right) - \sum_{n=1}^x {1\over \sqrt{n}} \right) \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(2\sqrt{n} - 2\sqrt{n-1} -{1\over \sqrt{n}} \right)
\end{align*} This sum converges according to Wolfram by comparison test, and according to me by the integral test, but what does it converge to? It converges incredibly slowly; my best guess is $\approx 1.458$","['summation', 'divergent-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"
1799030,Can matrices with dependent columns being QR factorization?,"The problem comes from the $18.06$ Linear Algebra by MIT Open Courseware. The answer: I am very confused. According to the definition, Matrix A -> QR means that A has independent columns. BUT it is obviously that the matrix B is singular in the problem. But it can be diagnoalized with 3 independent eigenvectors. How could that happen? Could you explain ? Thanks!",['linear-algebra']
