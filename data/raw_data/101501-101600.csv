1410859,Property of a set of a positive Lebesgue measure,"I am trying to see whether it is true that in any set of a positive Lebesgue measure in $R^2$ we can always find two points $(a_1,a_2)$ and $(b_1,b_2)$ such that the following hold: $a_1>b_1$ $a_2>b_2$ $a_1-2a_2>b_1-2b_2$. I think the starting point can be the fact that for any set $S$ of a positive Lebesgue measure in $R^2$ we can find a ball $B$ in $R^2$ such that $S\cap B$ has a positive Lebesgue measure in $R^2$ but not sure how to proceed with the proof from here.

$$y=\left[R+s\cos\left(\frac 12t\right)\right]\sin t$$
$$z=s\sin\left(\frac 12t\right)$$ but I would imagine the triangle shape would effect the equations quiet a bit.. any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. (source: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoebiusStrip.html )","['geometry', 'mobius-band', '3d', 'parametric']"

1410923,"Proof that $H^{0,1} \oplus H^{1,0} = H_{DR}^1$","I am struggling with a proof from Donaldson's Riemann Surfaces which he leaves as an exercise. we want to construct an isomorphism from the direct sum of $H^{1,0}(X)$, the set of holomorphic 1-forms on a riemann-surface $X$, direct summed with $H^{0,1}$, the cosets of $\overline{\partial}$-closed 1-forms modulo $\overline{\partial}$-exact forms. (alternatively, the first sheaf cohomology $H^1(\mathscr{O})$ of holomorphic functions.) The isomorphism we construct is this: we know that conjugation induces a map (and isomorphism from $H^{1,0}$ to $H^{0,1}$ from a representative of a class in $H^{0,1}$ to a holomorphic 1-form and vice-versa. We define a map $\phi$ from holomorphic 1-forms to their de-rham cohomology classes. now we take the map $\Psi(\alpha, [\beta]) = \phi(\alpha) + \overline{\phi(\overline{\beta'})}$ where $\beta'$ is a representative of $\beta$.

1410971,rolling a single die ten times,"I have the following problem on a homework assignment for my Probability theory course: You roll a single six sided die ten times. What is the probability that you roll four 1's, three 2's, and three 3's? I was hoping somebody could check my idea since I haven't done this sort of problem in a while. So my idea is to count the total number of ways you could get this outcome. My way of counting it is to first count the number of ways the four 1's could show up on the ten rolls. So we get ${10 \choose 4}$ ways this could happen. Now of the remaining 6 rolls I want to count the ways you could get three 2's, which is ${6 \choose 3}$. Now only three rolls remain so they have to be the three 3's. So what I'm getting is that there are ${10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}$ ways to get such an outcome. What I'm not sure of is if the probability would then be:
$$
\frac{{10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}}{6^{10}},
$$
or if the probability should be,
$$
\frac{{10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}3^4 2^3 1^3}{6^{10}}.

1410979,Cantor's diagonal argument modified version,"I have the following doubt regarding Cantor's diagonal argument. First of all, the ""usual case"" is quite clear for me. If $X$ is some set, then we can show there is no surjection from $X$ onto the set $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ of functions $f: X\to \{0,1\}$ by the following procedure: We consider $\varphi : X\to \mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ to be any function. It sufices to construct $f \in \mathcal{F}(X;\{0,1\})$ such that $f\notin \varphi(X)$. This can be done quite directly as $$f(x) = \begin{cases}1, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=0, \\ 0, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=1.\end{cases}$$ In that case, it is clear that $f(x)\neq\varphi(x)(x)$, so $f\neq \varphi(x)$ for any $x\in X$ and $\varphi$ is not surjective. Now, a slightly modified version I've found is: If $X$ is any non-empty set and $Y$ is a set with at least two elements, no function $\varphi : X \to \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$ is surjective. If $Y$ has at least two elements, we can label them $0_Y$ and $1_Y$. I've tried the same procedure, that is, let $\varphi : X\to \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$ be given and define $f : X\to Y$ by $$f(x) = \begin{cases}1_Y, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=0_Y, \\0_Y, & \text{if} \ \varphi(x)(x)=1_Y.\end{cases}$$ But this is not well-defined. Indeed, since $Y$ has at least two elements, there can be more elements on $Y$. In that case, it could happen that $\varphi(x)(x)$ is neither $0_Y$ or $1_Y$ and in that case $f(x)$ is not well-defined. My workaround was the following: first of all, it is quite easy to notice that if $A$ and $B$ are non-empty sets and $X\subset B$ is non-empty, then if there is no surjection $f : A\to X$ there is also no surjection $g : A\to B$. In that case, we can see that $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0_Y,1_Y\})\subset \mathcal{F}(X;Y)$, so we can use the usual argument to conclude there is no surjection from $X$ onto $\mathcal{F}(X;\{0_Y,1_Y\})$ and use this to conclude the same for $\mathcal{F}(X;Y)$. Although my workaround works, I'd like to know if there is any other more direct way. Is any other, possibly better, way of proving this result?","['elementary-set-theory', 'alternative-proof', 'proof-verification']"

1411153,Is $\overline{D}_{\varepsilon}$ a connected Jordan region in $\mathbb{R}^{n}?$,"Definition . Let $E$ be a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.The distance from a point $\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to set $E$ is defined by  $$d(\mathbb{x},E)=\inf\{||\mathbb{x}-\mathbb{y}||:\mathbb{y}\in E\}.$$
$E^{\circ}$ (respectively,$\overline{E}, \partial{E}$) is the interior (respectively, closure,boundary ) of a set $E$; Vol$(E)$ is the jordan content of $E.$ We have a set $S\subset  \mathbb{R}^{n},$ such that $S=\overline{D}$ for some nonempty，open, connected jordan region $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}.$ For each sufficiently small positive value of $\varepsilon $,let $$D_{\varepsilon}=\{\mathbb{x}\in D:d(\mathbb{x},\partial{D})\geq \varepsilon\}.$$
  Whether $\overline{D}_{\varepsilon}$ is a connected Jordan region in $\mathbb{R}^{n}?$ The following is my effort:
$$F_{1}=\{\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:d(\mathbb{x},\partial{D})\geq \varepsilon\}\text{ is closed},\quad F_{2}=\{\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:d(\mathbb{x},\partial{D})>\varepsilon\}\text{ is open}.$$ $$F^{\circ}_{1}=F_{2},D=D^{\circ},D^{\circ}_{\varepsilon}=F_{1}\cap D \Longrightarrow D^{\circ}_{\varepsilon}=(F_{1}\cap D)^{\circ}=F^{\circ}_{1}\cap D^{\circ}=F_{2}\cap D.$$
$$\partial F_{1}=\{\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:d(\mathbb{x},\partial{D})= \varepsilon\}.$$
Since $D$ is connected open set,it follows that $D^{\circ}_{\varepsilon}$ is connected open set.
$$\overline{D^{\circ}_{\varepsilon}}=\overline{D}_{\varepsilon}=D^{\circ}_{\varepsilon}\cup \partial {D_{\varepsilon}},\quad\partial {D_{\varepsilon}}\subseteq \partial F_{1}\cup \partial{D},\quad\text{Vol}{(\partial{D})}=0.$$

1411175,About an example of normal bundle of a curve over a surface,"I know the definition of the normal bundle $N_{C/S}$ of a curve $C$ over a surface $S$ as the cokernel of the injection $T_C \subset T_S|_C$ where $T$ is the tangent bundle . I would like to exhibit an explicit example of the normal bundle $N_{C|S}$ over a surface $S$ of a curve $C \subset S$. $S$ is a complete intersection of $4$ quadrics $Q_i$ $i=1,...,4$ lying in the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^6$. So $S=Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3 \cap Q_4$.  In my assumption i suppose that the curve $C=S \cap H$ where $H$ is an hyperplane of the six dimensional projective space. So, due to Bertini, $C$ is an hyperplane section. Can someone helping with some hint or suggestion? Perhaps an usefull relation. If i use the adjubction formula i get: $$K_C=(K_S\otimes N_{c/S})|_{C}=K_S|_C\otimes C|_C=K_S|_C\otimes H|_C$$ where $K$ is the canonical bundle. Than $K_C=2H|_C$ so using both equation i get $H|_C=N_{C/S}$. So if i want to compute $H^0(C,N_{C/S})$ i must calculate $H^0(C,H|_C)$. Any ideas to compute it? This is my idea to compute the dimension of the space $H^0(C,H|_{C})$. I can take the fundamental sequence of the curve $C$ i get $$ 0 \rightarrow O_S(-C)\rightarrow O_S \rightarrow O_C \rightarrow 0.$$
The exactness of the sequence is preserved if i multiply with the line bundle $H$. So i get $$ 0 \rightarrow O_S(H-C)\rightarrow O_S(H) \rightarrow O_C(H) \rightarrow 0$$. This sequence induces the following long exact sequence in cohomology $$0 \rightarrow H^0(S,O_S(H-C))\rightarrow H^0(S,O_S(H)) \rightarrow H^0(C,O_C(H)) \rightarrow H^1(S,O_S(H-C)) \rightarrow ....$$ and so on.

1411351,"If a set is countable and infinite, there is a bijection between the set and $\mathbb{N}$","I'm trying to show that if a set $S$ is infinite and countable then there is a bijection $\varphi : S\to \mathbb{N}$. Since $S$ is countable, we know that there is an injection $f: S\to \mathbb{N}$. Now there are two things that can be done: We can construct a bijection $\varphi : S\to \mathbb{N}$ directly. We can construct a surjection $g: S\to \mathbb{N}$ and use Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem to show there is a bijection between $S$ and $\mathbb{N}$. The second way seems better, but I don't know how to start. I thought on the following: we want to build a surjection $g : S\to \mathbb{N}$. For that, fix an element $a_1\in S$ and define $g(a_1)=1$. Now, since $S$ is infinite, $S\setminus\{a_1\}$ is infinite, so we can pick $a_2\in S\setminus\{a_1\}$ and define $g(a_2)=2$. We can continue this procedure arbitrarily so that given $n$ we will have $a_n\in S\setminus\{a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}\}$ so that $g(a_n)=n$, so that $g$ is a surjection. Although the idea is clear to me, I recognize it lacks rigor. First of all, the statement ""continue this process arbitrarily"" when defining $g$ is not meaningful from a rigorous standpoint in my opinion. I believe there should be some argument with the axiom of choice to make this rigorous, but there might be a simpler way. In that case, is this a correct way to prove the result? Also, how to make this idea I exposed rigorous and define $g$ correctly? EDIT: The definitions I'm using are as follows: A set $S$ is countable if there is an injective function $f : S\to \mathbb{N}$ A set $S$ is infinite if for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there is no bijection between $S$ and $\{1,\dots,n\}$. From the second definition then I've proved that if $S$ is infinite and $a\in S$ then $S\setminus\{a\}$ is non-empty and still infinite.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing']"

1411470,Proving a function $F$ is surjective if and only if $f$ is injective,"Problem: Let $X$ and $Y$ be non-empty sets and let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a function. Then we can define $F: P(Y) \rightarrow P(X)$ by \begin{align*} F(B) = f^{-1}(B) \qquad \text{for all} \ B \in P(Y). \end{align*} Prove that $F$ is surjective if and only $f$ is injective. (Here, $f^{-1}(B)$ denotes the inverse image, and $P(X), P(Y)$ are power sets.) Attempt at proof: I think I proved one implication already, though I'm not sure if every step in my reasoning is correct. This is what I did: First, suppose that $F$ is surjective. Let $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and suppose that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Let $A_1 = \left\{x_1\right\}$ and $A_2 = \left\{x_2 \right\}$, so that $A_1, A_2 \in P(X)$. Because $F$ is surjective, there exist $B_1, B_2 \in P(Y)$ such that $F(B_1) = A_1$ and $F(B_2) = A_2$. From the assumption that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, we have also that $f(A_1) = f(A_2)$. Thus by definition of $F$ we have: \begin{align*} F(B_1) = A_1 = f^{-1}(B_1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad F(B_2) = A_2 = f^{-1}(B_2). \end{align*} From this it follows that $f(A_1) = B_1$ and $f(A_2) = B_2$ (is this step correct?). Hence $B_1 = B_2$. So we get \begin{align*} F(B_1) = A_1 = F(B_2) = A_2 \end{align*} and so $A_1 = A_2$. Thus $x_1 = x_2$ and $f$ is injective. Now, the converse I find pretty hard. Suppose $f$ is injective, and let $A \in P(X)$. Then we have to prove that there exists a $B \in P(Y)$ such that $F(B) = A$. By definition of $F$ we have $F(B) = f^{-1}(B)$. Now, since $f$ is injective, the inverse image of $B$ exists of at most one element. But I cannot conclude that it is non-empty since $f$ may not be surjective. So I'm not sure what to do with $f^{-1}(B)$ in this case, and how to find $B$ such that $F(B) = A$. Help with this part would be appreciated. And also, was my reasoning in the first part correct?","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification', 'functions']"

1411542,Looking for a clarification of the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation with a (finite) example,"I have a problem concerning the output of (and the intuition behind) the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation . More specifically, I really don't see exactly what the output of it really is (even if I can actually use it to prove some very basic things), and I think this hampers my general understanding. In order to get some intuition, I decided to translate everything in terms of finite sets (this one should be an instantiation of the Alexandroff Operation). By doing this, I also added some numbered questions to emphasise my problems. This is the basic setting: $X = \{ a, b \}$ $A = \{0, 1 \}$ $A_e = \{ a, b \}$, $A_0 = \{ a \}$, $A_1 = \{ b \}$, $A_{00} = \varnothing = A_{10} = A_{01} = A_{11}$ where a Suslin scheme is a function of the form $A : A^{<\mathbb{N}} \to 2^X$. So, we have that $$ \mathcal{A}_2 ( \{ A_s \} ) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}}} \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_{\alpha|n} \hspace{7cm} (\square),$$ where $\{ A_s \}$ denotes the family of all the $A$ sets previously considered (this is a Suslin scheme that is also regular), and $\alpha|n$ denotes the initial segment $\alpha = ( \alpha_0, \alpha_1 , \dots, \alpha_{n-1})$ of length $n$ of a $\alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}}$. Hence we have that $$x \in \mathcal{A}_2 ( \{ A_s \} ) \Longleftrightarrow \exists \alpha \in A^{\mathbb{N}} : \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \ ( x \in A_{\alpha|n}) \hspace{3cm}(*).$$ Now, my problems start here. 1. Does this actually means that in this case, with finite $X$, the $\mathcal{A}$-Operation gives an empty result? This is my hypothesis because my intuition is the following. We are in a finite context, and no matter what $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we pick, still the process basically ends at the second digit (i.e. $A_{**}$) which is associated with the empty set, and hence there is no element that can fit the RHS of $(*)$. 2. Is this line of reasoning correct? If this is the case, then a natural consideration is that the power of the Suslin $\mathcal{A}$-Operation really comes from infinite spaces, where this process can go on indefinitely. 3. Again, is this correct? I am really looking forward to any feedback. Thank you in advance for your time.

1411945,"Counting matchings, the modern way","A hundred years ago, if you had $k$ men and $k$ women and wanted to marry them all off in pairs, it was easy to see that there are exactly $k!$ ways to do that. Today, however, societal standards have evolved, and many countries now recognize same-sex marriages. Mathematically we can model that by saying that men can now be brides and women can now be grooms. Each wedding still needs one bride and one groom, however, if only because one of the spouses needs to be listed in the left rubric on the marriage certificate and the other on the right. How many ways are there now to marry off our $2k$ persons in pairs? A bit of elementary combinatorics and algebra shows that we have
$$ \tag{$\dagger$} \frac{(2k)!}{k!} = (k+1)\cdot(k+2)\cdot(k+3)\cdots(2k-2)\cdot (2k-1) \cdot 2k $$
possibilities, when we want to remember who's the bride and who's the groom in each couple. However, every way I can think of to justify this formula depends on first counting a larger number of somethings, and then dividing out some factors to account for overcounting. (If we justify $(2k)!/k!$ as $\binom{2k}{k}k!$ the division is hidden inside the argument that $\binom nk=\frac{n}{k!(n-k)!}$). Question: Is there an intuitive way to explain the result $\text{($\dagger$)}$ where each of the $k$ factors have a discrete meaning? Or, in other words, an explicit description of a bijection from the set

1411949,Algebraic integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ for $m$ a squarefree integer,"I'm currently reading Marcus' ""Number Fields,"" and I'm having difficulty proving the following result: Corollary 2.2: Let $m$ be a squarefree integer. The set of algebraic integers in the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ is
$$ \left\{ a + b \sqrt{m} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} $$
if $m \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}$; and$$ \left\{ \frac{a+b\sqrt{m}}{2} : a,b \in \mathbb{Z} ~,~ a \equiv b \pmod{2} \right\}$$
when $m \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. $\square$ It is easy enough to see that the claimed sets do, indeed, consist of algebraic integers. The other half of the proof proceeds something like this: suppose that $\alpha = r + s \sqrt{m}$ is an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$. Then $\alpha$ is a root of the polynomial
$$ x^2 - 2rx + r^2 - s^2m $$
In particular, this means that $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer if and only if both $2r$ and $r^2 - s^2 m$ are integers. At this point, the proof stops, and says that this implies the result. And therein lies the problem: I don't see how to make the connection. I do know, for example, that if one of $r,s$ is an integer, then the other one must be, too, i.e., either both are integers, or both are not. However, I cannot get any further than that.

Rearranging the above we arrive at $H_k - p/q = \ln k$, which implies that $\ln k$ is rational since $H_k$ is rational. But we know that $\ln k$ is irrational for all integers $k>1$, hence we reach a contradiction. Therefore, $\lambda_n$ is irrational for all integers $n>1$.

1412136,Proof of $(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)=(A-B)\cup(B-A)$,"I was trying to prove $(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)=(A-B)\cup(B-A)$ and came across issues in translating (pertaining to what I did with $\emptyset$) and got through the proof but was doubting its accuracy so if someone could please affirm or deny its accuracy that would be great. Also, I'm guessing there's much shorter ways of proving this and was thinking of what those ways might be and all I could come up with was set construction. Any ideas on others? My proof is as follows: Suppose $x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)$. Thus $x\in(A\cup B):x\notin(A\cap B)$. Hence $x\in A$ or $x\in B:x\notin A$ or $x\notin B$. This presents us with 4 cases: $x\in A:x\notin A$ $x\in A:x\notin B$ $x\in B:x\notin A$ $x\in B:x\notin B$ Case 1 and 4 are $\emptyset$ however so we really have $x\in\emptyset$, or $x\in A:x\notin B$, or $x\in B:x\notin A$, or $x\in\emptyset$ which is equivalent to
$x\in\emptyset$, or $x\in(A-B)$, or $x\in(B-A)$, or $x\in\emptyset$.
Which is the same as $x\in\emptyset\cup(A-B)\cup(B-A)\cup\emptyset$
And since the union of the empty set with any set X is the set X itself, we have $x\in(A-B)\cup(B-A)$, which shows that $\forall x[x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\Rightarrow x\in(A-B)\cup(B-A)]$. Alternatively, suppose that $x\in(A-B)\cup(B-A)$. Since the union of any set X is the set X itself, we can say that $x\in\emptyset_1\cup(A-B)\cup(B-A)\cup\emptyset_2$ where $\emptyset_1={x\in A:x\notin A}$ and $\emptyset_2={x\in B:x\notin B}$ so $x\in\emptyset_1$, or $x\in(A-B)$, or $x\in(B-A)$, or $x\in\emptyset_2$, thus $x\in [x\in A:x\notin A] $, or $x\in A:x\notin B$, or $x\in B:x\notin A$, or $x\in B:x\notin B$, hence $x\in A:x\notin A$, or $x\in A:x\notin B$, or $x\in B:x\notin A$, or $x\in B:x\notin B$, therefore $x\in A$ or $x\in B$, and $x\notin A$ or $x\notin B$ such that $x\in(A\cup B)$ and $x\notin(A\cap B)$ which means that $x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)$. The former shows that $\forall x[x\in(A-B)\cup(B-A)\Rightarrow x\in(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)]$
, and thus $(A-B)\cup(B-A)\subset(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)$ by the definition of a subset.

ze^{-x}= xe^{-x} + e^{-x} + C

Let $r > 0$ be a real constant. Does the inequality $$\left| \nabla (|f|^r) \right| \le r |f|^{r-1} |\nabla f|$$
  hold pointwise?  Is there a nice elegant proof? For $f > 0$ the inequality is an equality, since $\nabla (f^r) = r f^{r-1} \nabla f$ by the chain rule.  If we identify $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\mathbb{C}$ and take $f$ holomorphic, it is not hard to show that $\left| \nabla (|f|^r) \right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r |f|^{r-1} |\nabla f|$ so the inequality can be strict. For the general case, I am getting bogged down in real and imaginary parts - there must be a better way. If there is a proof that works for $\mathbb{R}^d$ instead of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that is even better. Notation, as requested: $\nabla f : U \to \mathbb{C}^2$ is, as usual, the function $\nabla f = ( \partial_x f, \partial_y f)$.  The partial derivatives $\partial_x f, \partial_y f$ are defined by taking the partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of $f$ separately. So if $f = u+iv$ where $u,v  : U \to \mathbb{R}$ are the real and imaginary parts, we have $\partial_x f = \partial_x u + i \partial_x v$, etc.  In particular, we have
$$|\nabla f| = \sqrt{(\partial_x u)^2 + (\partial_y u)^2 + (\partial_x v)^2 + (\partial_y v)^2}.$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'complex-numbers', 'inequality']"
1412385,Bernstein inequality for non-centered random variables (Is there a counterexample?),"The usual Bernstein inequality (see e.g. Rauhut + Fourcat, A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing, Theorem 7.30) states that if $X_1, \dots, X_m$ are independent mean zero random variables with
$$
\Bbb{E}|X_\ell|^n \leq \frac{n!}{2}\cdot R^{n-2} \cdot \sigma_\ell^2 \qquad \qquad (\ddagger)
$$
for all $n \geq 2$ and $1 \leq \ell \leq m$, then for all $t>0$, we have
$$
\Bbb{P}\bigg(\bigg|\sum_{\ell = 1}^M X_\ell \bigg| \geq t\bigg) \leq 2\cdot \exp\bigg(-\frac{t^2 /2}{\sigma^2 + Rt}\bigg)
$$
with $\sigma^2 = \sum_\ell \sigma_\ell^2$. In another paper I have found (without proof and without indication of a source) that even if we do not assume the $X_i$ to have mean zero, we still get
$$
\Bbb{P}\bigg(\bigg|\sum_{\ell = 1}^M (X_\ell - \Bbb{E}X_\ell )\bigg| \geq t\bigg) \leq 2\cdot \exp\bigg(-\frac{t^2 /2}{\sigma^2 + Rt}\bigg). \qquad \qquad (\dagger)
$$ First of all, I noted that one could try to derive this new claim from the original one by considering the mean zero random variables $Y_\ell := X_\ell - \Bbb{E}(X_\ell)$. But the problem here is that the best estimate I was able to show is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Bbb{E}|Y_\ell|^n &\leq& \Bbb{E}( |X_\ell| + \Bbb{E}|X_\ell|)^n \\
&\leq& 2^{n-1} \cdot \Bbb{E}[|X_\ell|^n + (\Bbb{E}|X_\ell|)^n ] \\
&\leq& 2^n \cdot \Bbb{E}|X_\ell|^n \\
& \leq & 2^n \cdot \frac{n!}{2} \cdot R^{n-2} \cdot \sigma_\ell^2\\
&=& \frac{n!}{2} \cdot (2R)^{n-2} \cdot (2\sigma_\ell)^2,
\end{eqnarray*}
where I used Jensen's inequality to get $(\Bbb{E}|X_\ell|)^n \leq \Bbb{E}|X_\ell|^n$. But with these bounds for $Y_\ell$ (which are worse than those for $X_\ell$), we only get
$$
\Bbb{P}\bigg(\bigg|\sum_{\ell = 1}^M (X_\ell - \Bbb{E}X_\ell )\bigg| \geq t\bigg) \leq 2\cdot \exp\bigg(-\frac{t^2 /2}{4 \sigma^2 + 2Rt}\bigg) \leq 2\cdot \exp\bigg(-\frac{t^2 /8}{\sigma^2 + Rt}\bigg).
$$ Summing up, my question is the following: Even though I am not able to deduce the non-centered result from the centered one, is the non-centered result (as in $(\dagger)$) still true, or can one find a counterexample? My search for a counterexample so far has not been very fruitful. What I tried to do is to find a counterexample for the case $m=1$, i.e. only one random variable, in particular I tried $X$ which only assume values $M$ and $-1$, the value $M$ with low probability $p> 0$, so that the expected value is negative . This will then cause $X - \Bbb{E}X$ to attain even larger values than $X$ with probability $p>0$. But this construction did not produce a counterexample, at least for the choices of $M,p$ that I tried.","['probability-theory', 'large-deviation-theory']"

$$\frac{F''(z)}{F'(z)}=\frac{-\beta_k}{z-A_k}+E_K(z)$$ I don't know why this expression is true and also don't understand the meaning of $\frac{F''(z)}{F'(z)}$ for $\text{Im}(z)<0$, since only $h_k$ is defined for $\text{Im}z<0$ but not $F$ (if I define $F=h_k^{\alpha_k}+a_k$, will it be the same $F$ as the one I will discuss in the next paragraph?). Here I assume $$h_k(z)=e^{i\theta}\overline{h_k(\overline z)}\hspace{.5in} \text{for}\hspace{.1in}\text{Im}(z)>0.$$ Secondly, in the next page (p.244), the writer is going to proof that $F$ is holomorphic outside a large circle so is at the infinity.

Idea: The case $\gcd(A_1,\ldots,A_N)=1$ may follow from Elementary proof that if $A$ is a matrix map from $\mathbb{Z}^m$ to $\mathbb Z^n$, then the map is surjective iff the gcd of maximal minors is $1$","['conjectures', 'matrices', 'determinant', 'number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"
1412652,Minesweeper probability,I ran into the situation pictured in the minesweeper game below. Note that the picture is only a small section of the entire board. Note: The bottom right $1$ is the bottom right corner tile of the board and all other tiles have been marked/deemed safe. What we know: There are exactly $2$ bombs left on the board Bombs can't be: (A & B) || (A & C) || (B & D) || (C & D) Bombs can be: (A & D) || (B & C) Can anyone prove if there is a square that is more likely to be safe/unsafe or is every square equally likely to be safe/unsafe?,"['algebra-precalculus', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
1412653,Topics to master (be literate at) before differential equations?,"Good evening, I'm really enthusiastic about learning differential equations because it was said that D.E. is the most important tool of mathematics "" can be used for modelling real-world physical occurrences "". I've taken courses in Differential and Integral Calculus (including numerical techniques of evaluation), and had self-studied Multivariable Calculus (only from partial differentiation, multiple integration, Vector Integration Stoke's, Green's), Series (taylor/maclaurin, covergence, divergence), and a little bit of linear algebra (before vector spaces). I have a book on Differential Equations but it seems that I can't understand the way it proves and explains the rules and theorems (I can solve separable first order and the one with dy/dx + y = c, but I'm stuck after it, specifically on the uniqueness and existence of solutions). So for the people who are adept at D.E., what mathematical techniques/knowledge should I study to further understand Differential Equations? (My plan now is to finish my linear algebra book) PS. I am an engineering major :), though my math courses are focused on the application and problem solving, I keep it to a point that I know its basis and that I can derive it.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
1412663,Why $\dfrac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}=\dfrac{\partial \sigma}{\partial \bar{u}}$?,"According to Elementary Differential Geometry by A N Pressley: $\Large\textbf{5.3. Conformal Mappings of Surfaces}$ Now that we understand how to measure lengths of curves on surfaces, it is natural to ask about angles. Suppose that two curves $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ and $\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}$ on a surface $\cal S$ intersect at a point $P$ that lies in a surface patch $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ of $\cal S$. Then, $\boldsymbol\gamma(t)=\boldsymbol\sigma(u(t),v(t))$ and $\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}(t)=\boldsymbol\sigma(\tilde u(t),\tilde v(t))$ for some smooth function $u,v,\tilde u$ and $\tilde v$, and for some parameter values $t_0$ and $\tilde {t_0}$, we have $\boldsymbol\sigma(u(t_0),v(t_0))$ $=$ $P$ $=$ $\boldsymbol\sigma(\tilde u(\tilde{t_0}),\tilde v(t_0))$. The angle $\theta$ of intersection of $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ and $\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}$ at $P$ is defined to be the angle between the tangent vectors $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}$ (evaluated at $t\mathop =t_0$ and $t\mathop=\tilde{t_0}$, respectively). Using the dot product formula for the angle between vectors, we see that $\theta$ is given by $$\cos\theta=\frac{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\cdot\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}}{\|\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\|\|\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}\|}.$$ By the chain rule, $$\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\boldsymbol\sigma_u\dot{u}+\boldsymbol\sigma_v\dot{v},\quad\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}=\boldsymbol\sigma_u\dot{\tilde u}+\boldsymbol\sigma_v\dot{\tilde v},$$ so $$\begin{align}\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\cdot\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}&=(\boldsymbol\sigma_u\dot{u}+\boldsymbol\sigma_v\dot{v})\cdot(\boldsymbol\sigma_u\dot{\tilde u}+\boldsymbol\sigma_v\dot{\tilde v})\\&=(\boldsymbol\sigma_u\cdot\boldsymbol\sigma_u)\dot{u}\dot{\tilde u}+(\boldsymbol\sigma_u\cdot\boldsymbol\sigma_v)(\dot{u}\dot{\tilde v}+\dot{\tilde u}\dot{v})+(\boldsymbol\sigma_v\cdot\boldsymbol\sigma_v)\dot{v}\dot{\tilde v}\\&=E\dot{u}\dot{\tilde u}+F(\dot{u}\dot{\tilde v}+\dot{\tilde u}\dot{v})+G\dot{v}\dot{\tilde v}.\end{align}$$ Replacing $\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}$ by $\boldsymbol\gamma$ (resp. $\boldsymbol\gamma$ by $\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}$) gives similar expressions for $\|\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\|^2=\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\cdot\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ (resp. $\|\dot{\boldsymbol{\tilde\gamma}}\|^2$), which finally give the formula $$\cos\theta=\frac{E\dot{u}\dot{\tilde u}+F(\dot{u}\dot{\tilde v}+\dot{\tilde u}\dot{v})+G\dot{v}\dot{\tilde v}}{(E\dot{u}^2+2F\dot{u}\dot{v}+G\dot{v}^2)^{1/2}(E\dot{\tilde u}^2+2F\dot{\tilde u}\dot{\tilde v}+G\dot{\tilde v}^2)^{1/2}}.\tag5$$ (${\bf \sigma}_u=:\dfrac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}$).

1412670,Why is the Lagrange Multipliers Theorem not working?,"Consider the function $h: K \to \mathbb{R}$ where $K := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^3:x,y,z \geq 0, x+2y+3z\leq 6\}$. $h$ is defined as: $$ h(x) = xe^{(x+2y+3z)} $$ Find the supremum and the infimum of $h$. Well, it seems to be a fairly easy task, right? By The Weierstrass Extreme Value Theorem there must be both maximum and minimum. Let's find out if we can find any extremum inside $K$. Looking for extrema inside $K$: $$\nabla h(x)=\left((x+1)e^{(x+2y+3z)},2xe^{(x+2y+3z)},3xe^{(x+2y+3z)}\right)$$ As we can see, the gradient of the function $h$ will never be $0$, otherwise $x$ would have to be $-1$ and $0$ at the same time. Plot twist: Actually, there is an extremum inside $K$ - the function $h$ takes its lowest value at points $(0,y,z)$ where $0 \leq2y+3z\leq 6$. Let's examine the borders of $K$, shall we? The border set $M$ is defined as $M:=\{x\in \mathbb{R}:F(x)=c\}$ where $F(x)=x+2y+3z$ and $c=6$. Gradient of $F$ is:
$$
\nabla F(x)=(1,2,3)
$$ So, by The Lagrange Multipliers Theorem we have the following system of equations:
$$
\begin{cases}
(x+1)e^{(x+2y+3z)} = \lambda\\ 
2xe^{(x+2y+3z)} = 2\lambda\\
3xe^{(x+2y+3z)} = 3\lambda\\
x+2y+3z=6
\end{cases}
$$
And again there are no solutions. But hey! Wait! Plot twist once again: $h$ has a maximum at point $x=(6,0,0)$. I'm starting to realise that I should have be more careful with defining the set $M$ for the Langrange Multipliers. The function $F$ itself is not enough since I'm lacking the information that $x,y,z\geq 0$. Is it the only thing I am doing wrong? Could you please show me a hint or two to make me understand my mistakes?","['optimization', 'lagrange-multiplier', 'multivariable-calculus']"
