590153,Maps between spectral sequences,"I am trying to understand a subtle point about how Theorem 2.2.5 is used in Kedlaya, Abbott, and Roe's ""Bounding Picard numbers of surfaces using p-adic cohomology"".  Below I've tried to pose the question in more generality, with $\mathcal{F}$ representing the log-de Rham complex of $X$ along a divisor $Z$, and $\mathcal{G}$ representing a twist of $\mathcal{F}$. Suppose $X$ is a topological space and that $\mathcal{F}^0 \subset \mathcal{F}^1 \subset \cdots \subset \mathcal{F}^n$ and $\mathcal{G}^0 \subset \mathcal{G}^1 \subset \cdots \subset \mathcal{G}^n$ are cochain complexes of sheaves on $X$.  Then there are spectral sequences $E_r$,$\widetilde{E}_r$ abutting to the hypercohomology of $\mathcal{F}^*$ and $\mathcal{G}^*$, respectively, such that $E_2^{a,b} = \text{H}^b(X,\text{H}^a(\mathcal{F}^*))$ and $\widetilde{E}_2^{a,b} = \text{H}^b(X,\text{H}^a(\mathcal{G}^*))$. Suppose $m$ is a positive integer and $\varphi : \mathcal{F}^* \rightarrow \mathcal{G}^*$ is a morphism inducing maps on homology $\varphi_a: \text{H}^a(\mathcal{F}^*) \rightarrow \text{H}^a(\mathcal{G}^*)$ such that the following hold $\varphi_0$ is an isomorphism. For each point $P \in X$ there is an open set $U$ containing $P$ with the following property:  For each $y \in \text{H}^a(\mathcal{G}^*)(U)$ one can write \begin{equation}y=\varphi_a(x)+z\end{equation} for some $x \in \text{H}^a(\mathcal{F}^*)(U)$ and $z \in \text{H}^a(\mathcal{G}^*)(U)$ with $mz=0$. My question:  Can we conclude (by looking at maps on the $E_\infty$ terms of the spectral sequences) that the cokernel of the induced map on hypercohomology
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{H}^{n}(X,\mathcal{F}^*) \rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{n}(X,\mathcal{G}^*)
\end{equation}

590205,"Show that the cone of the open interval (0, 1) can not be embedded in any Euclidean space","I've been trying to tackle this problem for some while now, but don't know how to start correctly. I know that the cone on $(0,1)$ is given by $$\text{Cone}((0,1)) = (0,1) \times [0,1]/((0,1)\times\{1\}).$$ But how do I show that it can not be embedded in an Euclidean space? Cause for me it looks like it is possible.(Open cylinder with the ""ceiling"" collapsed to one point. I'm guessing that the problem  for me also lies in what a quotient really is, cause I can't really get a good feeling for it. I don't want the answer, I just want a push in the right direction so that I can think about how to solve it. Edit:
New insight, when thinking about the cone, it should be something like this (I guess) but this would mean that it can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ I think, which contradicts the question. Thanks",['general-topology']

590219,How to prove the ring of Laurent polynomials over a field is a principal ideal domain?,"Disclaimer: this is a homework question. I'm looking for direction, not an answer. Given a field $F$ , show that $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is a principal ideal domain. I'm unsure how to proceed. Would it be better to prove this directly? (ie, let $I$ be an ideal, show that $I = (f)$ for some $f \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ ). The proof that polynomials are a PID would involve (I imagine) division by remainder and use of degree, both of which don't seem to have obvious parallels for Laurent polynomials. Should I try and devise some parallels and mimic the proof for polynomials? Or is this overkill? (or just wrong?) edit 1 : I guess the approach I mentioned above amounts to showing that Laurent polynomials are a euclidean domain (we know that euclidean domain => principle ideal domain, so this would be sufficient) Are they a euclidean domain though? (it seems like this would have been the question if they were, instead of asking if they were a PID). edit 2 : I've spat this out, think most parts of it are correct, though it seems kind of ugly/cumbersome (but that might just be me trying to spell things out more than is needed): Given a Laurent polynomial $f \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ , define its ""negative
  degree"" $\deg^-(f)$ to be the largest power of $x^{-1}$ that appears
  in $f$ . Let $I$ be an ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ . Note that $\{x^{-\deg^-(f)}f \mid f \in I\} \subseteq F[x]$ . Let $J$ be the
  ideal in $F[x]$ generated by this set. $F[x]$ is a principal ideal
  domain, so $J$ is a principal ideal and we have $J = (j)$ for some $j \in F[x]$ . We claim $I = (j)$ (now meaning an ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ ). Let $f \in I$ . Then $x^{-\deg^-(f)}f \in J$ , meaning $f = x^{\deg^-(f)}g$ , where $g = x^{-\deg^-(f)}f$ is in $J$ . Because $g \in
J = (j)$ , there exists $g' \in F[x]$ such that $g = g'j$ , and thus $f = (x^{\deg^-(f)}g')j$ is a multiple of $j$ , so $f \in (j)$ . Let $f \in (j)$ . Then $f = gj$ for some $g \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ . But note
  that $j = x^{-\deg^-(f')}f'$ for some $f' \in I$ , so $f = gx^{-\deg^-(f')}f'$ , so $f$ is a multiple of an element of an ideal $I$ , so $f$ itself is in $I$ . This shows $I = (j)$ . So an arbitrary ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is
  principal, so $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is a principal ideal domain. I kind of feel like I still don't ""get"" the proof (I more-or-less see how each part works with the others but I'm having trouble seeing the bigger picture), though this may be due to a poor handle on ideals in general.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
590251,Non-measurable set in product $\sigma$-algebra s.t. every section is measurable.,"Let $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ be two nonempty sets and $\mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{B}$ be $\sigma$-algebras over $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, respectively. The product $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{B}$ is defined to be the smallest $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega\times\Gamma$ that contains the sets of the forma $A\times B$, for $A\in\mathscr{A}$ and $B\in\mathscr{B}$, and it is denoted by $\mathscr{A}\times\mathscr{B}$. When referring to measurable subsets of $\Omega$, $\Gamma$ or $\Omega\times\Gamma$, I will mean elements of the respective $\sigma$-algebras$. Given a set $L\subseteq\Omega\times\Gamma$ and elements $\omega\in\Omega$ and $\gamma\in\Gamma$, the sections of $L$ by $\omega$ and $\gamma$ are, respectively,
$$L_\omega=\left\{y\in\Gamma:(\omega,y)\in L\right\}\qquad\text{and}\qquad L^\gamma=\left\{w\in\Omega:(w,\gamma)\in L\right\}.$$ The following fact is very easily proved: Fact: If $L\subseteq\Omega\times\Gamma$ is measurable, then all its sections are measurable. Now, the converse is not true: If $\Omega$ is a set with cardinality $>2^{\aleph_0}$ equipped with the sigma algebra $\mathscr{P}(\Omega)$, the power set of $\Omega$, then the diagonal $\Delta_\Omega=\left\{(\omega,\omega):\omega\in\Omega\right\}$ is not in the product $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{P}(\Omega)\times\mathscr{P}(\Omega)$, but all its sections are (obviously) measurable. For a proof, see Does $\mathcal P ( \mathbb R ) \otimes \mathcal P ( \mathbb R ) = \mathcal P ( \mathbb R \times \mathbb R )$? and the reference given in the question . What I want is a simpler example of it. Summarizing: Question: Give an (simple) example of a non-measurable set in the product space s.t. all its sections are measurable. All I could find out is that the product $\sigma$-algebra cannot be finite, so neither $\mathscr{A}$ nor $\mathscr{B}$ can.","['measure-theory', 'examples-counterexamples']"

590311,"Is $G$ always a semidirect product of $[G,G]$ and $G/[G,G]$?","If $G$ is a finite group, it is not true in general that $G$ is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup $N$ and the quotient group $G/N$.  It is also not true in general that there is a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to $G/N$. But if $N=[G,G]$, the commutator subgroup of $G$, then I believe both these statements should be true.  Are they? My intuition is that, since the elements of $N$ are products of non-trivial commutators of $G$, whereas $G/N$ is abelian, then if $G/N$ were isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$, we would clearly have $N \bigcap G/N=\langle e \rangle$.  Further, since $G/N$ is the ""albelianization"" of $G$, it seems intuitive that $G$ should contain a subgroup $H$ isomorphic to $G/N$. That would naturally lead to all elements of $G$ as products of elements of $N$ and $H$, which gives us $G$ as a semidirect product of $N$ and $H$.  But I do not know how to prove that such an $H$ exists, or if it may not. I ask this question because, if true, it would lead to a nice intuitive characterization of nonabelian solvable groups as nonabelian only with respect to the semidirect product of otherwise abelian factors.  Thanks in advance! EDIT: As I note in my comment, the counterexample $Q_8$ may not be valid, as $Q_8/\mathbb Z_2 \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$, not $\mathbb Z_4$.

590317,Etale cohomology and algebraic closure,"$\DeclareMathOperator{\h}{H}$Apologies in advance if this is overly stupid. Let $k$ be a field and $X$ a variety over $k$. Let $n$ be an integer which is invertible in $k$. One often looks at the groups $\h^i(X_{\bar k},\mathbb Z/n)$, i.e. the cohomology of the constant sheaf $\mathbb Z/n$ on the etale site of $X_{\bar k} = X\times_{\operatorname{Spec} k}\operatorname{Spec}{\bar k}$. We 
give this a $G_k=\operatorname{Gal}(\bar k/k)$-action via the action of $G_k$ on $\bar k$. I'm wondering if there is a simpler way to do this. The category of continuous $G_k$-modules is equivalent to the category of etale sheaves on $\operatorname{Spec} k$. If we let $f:X\to \operatorname{Spec} k$ be the structure morphism, then for any sheaf $\mathscr F$ on $X$, we have $G_k$-modules 
$\mathsf R^i f_\ast \mathscr F$. My question is: Is $\mathsf R^i f_\ast \mathscr F$ naturally isomorphic (as a $G_k$-module) to $\h^i(X_{\bar k}, \mathscr F)$?","['arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'etale-cohomology']"

590332,Constructing a Distributional Solution to the Inhomogeneous C.R. Equations,"The question is to find a fundamental solution to the system of equations in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ \begin{array}{l}
u_{x}-v_{y}=f\\
u_{y}+v_{x}=g\end{array} and to express the answer as a $2\times2$ matrix of tempered distributions.  I really have had no experience with solving systems of PDE, so while the Fourier transform will undoubtedly be needed here, I'm not sure how to apply it.  Also, I don't really understand the directions.  How can we have a $2\times2$ matrix of solutions? Are we not solving for $u$ and $v$?  Furthermore, what characterizes a fundamental solution for a system.  It almost certainly should involve the $\delta$ distribution, no?  So if this is the case, why the $f$ and $g$? Here's my attempted solution... I will use the following convention for the Fourier transform: $$\mathcal{F}(u(x,y))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}u(x,y)e^{-i(x\xi+y\zeta)}\;dxdy.$$  Then applying $\mathcal{F}$ to both equations we get
\begin{array}{l}
i\xi\hat{u}-i\zeta\hat{v}=\hat{f}\\
i\zeta\hat{u}+i\xi\hat{v}=\hat{g}.
\end{array} If we solve for $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{v}$ we then get
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{u}=-\frac{i\xi\hat{f}+i\zeta\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{x}}+\hat{g_{y}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\\
\hat{v}=-\frac{i\zeta\hat{f}-i\xi\hat{g}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}=-\frac{\hat{f_{y}}-\hat{g_{x}}}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\end{array}
so that by the convolution theorem
\begin{array}{l}
u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{x}+g_{y})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right)\\
u=-\frac{1}{2\pi}(f_{y}-g_{x})*\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right)
\end{array} So then, formally speaking, if
$$h=\frac{-1}{2\pi}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$
then
$$u=f_{x}*h+g_{y}*h$$
and
$$v=f_{y}*h-g_{x}*h.$$ The fundamental solution is convolution with $f$ and $g$, however, not the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$.  Also, the above solution can't be expressed with respect to convolution of a $2\times2$ matrix.  So, let us use the multipliers for the differentiation operators and immediately apply the convolution theorem.  To that end we have
$$\begin{array}{l}
\hat{u}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\xi\hat{f}+\zeta\hat{g}\right).\\
\hat{v}=\frac{-i}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\left(\zeta\hat{f}-\xi\hat{g}\right).
\end{array}$$
Then if $$A=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\xi}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$ $$B=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\frac{\zeta}{\xi^{2}+\zeta^{2}}\right),$$
and $$M=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\B&-A\end{pmatrix}$$
then
$$\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}=M*\begin{pmatrix}f\\g\end{pmatrix}.$$ Would you think this is an acceptable answer?  Is it possible to explicitly invert $A$ and $B$?  The instructions ask for a $2\times2$ matrix of tempered distributions representing the fundamental solution. Clearly $M$ is the fundamental solution.  Presumably $f$ and $g$ are tempered so the operations used to solve for $u$ and $v$ are also tempered.  I still to this day just have difficulty accepting results obtained by formal operations on distributions as if they were functions as being true (or as being obtained rigorously I should say) since behind the scenes they are not functions (of course, I could probably just write everything as a linear functional to verify what I got already, but this seems dumb and unnecessary).","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations', 'distribution-theory', 'systems-of-equations', 'analysis']"

When calculating the volume , using disc integration, I've been taught to reason in the following way: divide the solid into several cylinders of infinitesimal width $dx$. Then each such cylinder has radius $f(x)$ , so its volume is $\pi\cdot f(x)^2~dx$ . Hence the total volume of the solid of revolution is $V=\pi\int_a^b f(x)^2~dx$ . So when calculating the surface area , I figure I should be able to reason thus: as before, divide the solid into several cylinders, except now calculate the area of each one instead of its volume. This should yield $A=2\pi\int_a^bf(x)~dx$. However, this is the wrong answer. In order to get the proper formula, I need to replace $dx$ with the arc length , which is $\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}~dx$ .

590533,Counting the number of polygons in a figure,"I often come across figures like this on the net, or as contest problems, asking to find the number of a specific type of polygon in the figure (triangles, in this case). But I've never really found a method for solving it, rather than blindly counting and hoping it's the right answer. For complete graphs, the problem is trivial:- ${n \choose k} \times (n-k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the complete graph, and $(k+1)$ is the number of sides of the polygon in question. But I was wondering if there was a general algorithm for going about these problems. Any ideas? DISCUSSION SO FAR : My above answer obtained for the complete graph is incorrect, as I hadn't considered the possibility of collinear vertices, and hence degenerate polygons (Thanks to Carl's brilliant answer, for pointing this out!). So here's the discussion so far: One can obtain the number of triangles (including degenerate) in any graph from the trace of its adjacency matrix $A$, by the formula $\text{Tr}(A^3)/3!$ (read Carl's post for the explanation). Unfortunately, this cannot be used for higher polygons, since cycles of path lengths $k$, $ k>3$ are attainable in less than $k$ vertices. So, focusing for now on obtaining the number of triangles in a graph, the algorithm is to compute $\text{Tr}(A^3)/3!$, and then to subtract the number of degenerate triangles from it. So now, the essential question is: Is there is a method for systematically enumerating distinct sets of collinear nodes in a graph?","['graph-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

590716,How long would it take to clean up the Great Lakes?,"Problem Details The idea of the problem is to find out how long it would take to flush the Great Lakes of pollution. They're set up as a series of five tanks and you are given inflow rates of clean water, inflow rates from the other tanks, and outflow rates. For our model, we make the following assumptions: The volume of each lake remains constant. The flow rates are constant throughout the year. When a liquid enters the lake, perfect mixing occurs and the pollutants are uniformly distributed. Pollutants are dissolved in the water and enter or leave by inflow or outflow of solution. Before using this model to obtain estimates on the cleanup times for the lakes, we consider some simpler models: (a) Use the outflow rates given in the figure to determine the time
  it would take to “drain” each lake. This gives a lower bound on how
  long it would take to remove all the pollutants. (b) A better estimate is obtained by assuming that each lake is a
  separate tank with only clean water flowing in. Use this approach to
  determine how long it would take the pollution level in each lake to
  be reduced to 50% of its original level. How long would it take to
  reduce the pollution to 5% of its original level? (c) Finally, to take into account the fact that pollution from one
  lake flows into the next lake in the chain, use the entire multiple
  compartment model given in the figure  to determine when the
  pollution level in each lake has been reduced to 50% of its original
  level, assuming pollution has ceased (that is, inflows not from a
  lake are clean water). Assume that all the lakes initially have the same pollution concentration $p$. How long would it take for the pollution to be reduced to 5% of its original level? Solution so far: $\frac{dA}{dt}$ = rate in-rate out where $A$ is the amount of pollution at time $t$. First I wrote equations for each lake. Rather than using $A$ as my variable, I used the first letter of each lake (with $n$ for Ontario) to stand for the amount of pollution in the given lake at time $t$. This gives... $$\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{-15s}{2900} $$
$$\frac{dm}{dt} = \frac{-38m}{1180} $$
$$\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{15s}{2900} + \frac{38m}{1180} - \frac{68h}{850} $$
$$\frac{de}{dt} = \frac{68h}{850} - \frac{85e}{116} $$
$$\frac{dn}{dt} = \frac{85e}{116} - \frac{99n}{393} $$ Rearranging and pulling out the differential operator leads to the following system: $$\left(D + \frac{38}{1180}\right)[m] = 0 $$
$$\left(D - \frac{68}{850}\right)[h] + \frac{38m}{1180} - \frac{15s}{2900}=0 $$
$$\left(D + \frac{15}{2900}\right)[s] = 0 $$
$$\left(D + \frac{85}{116}\right)[e] - \frac{68h}{850} = 0 $$
$$\left(D + \frac{99}{393}\right)[n] - \frac{85e}{116} = 0 $$ This is where I'm stuck. I have this system of five equations with five variables.

By an infinitesimal deformation of $X$, I mean a flat surjective map $\mathfrak X\to S=\textrm{Spec }A$, where $A$ is a local Artin $k$-algebra, such that $X$ is isomorphic to the closed fiber of this map. An isomorphism of deformations is an $S$-isomorphism between the total spaces, compatible with the inclusions of $X$ inside them. By a trivial deformation, I mean a deformation which is isomorphic to the product deformation $X\times \textrm{Spec }A\to \textrm{Spec }A$. An algebraic variety $X$ is said to be rigid if it has no nontrivial infinitesimal deformations. One can show that if $X$ is nonsingular, then it is rigid of and only if $H^1(X,T_X)=0$, where $T_X$ is tha tangent bundle. But $H^1(X,T_X)$ parameterizes, for any nonsingular $X$, isomorphism classes of first order deformations of $X$: those deformations defined over the dual numbers $D=k[t]/t^2$. So, a posteriori , there should be something special in nonsingular varieties: if they have no nontrivial first order deformations, they have no infinitesimal deformations at all.

591005,Hartshorne proposition II(2.6),"I am studying the proof of the following proposition in Hartshorne - Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. There is a natural fully faithful functor $Var(k)\longrightarrow Sch(k)$ from the category of varieties over $k$ to schemes over $k$. First they make some statements about general topological spaces (in which I have  a doubt). Let $X$ be any topological space. And let $t(X)$ be the set of non-empty irreducible closed subsets of $X$. If $Y, Y_1, Y_2, Y_i$ $(i\in I)$ are closed subsets of $X$, then we can check that $t(Y)\subset t(X)$, $t(Y_1)\cup t(Y_2)=t(Y_1\cup Y_2)$ and $\bigcap_{i\in I}t(Y_i)=t(\bigcap_{i\in I}Y_i\big)$. From this, we can make $t(X)$ a topological space, by taking closed subsets of $t(X)$ to be subsets of the form $t(Y)$, where $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$.  Further if $f:X_1\longrightarrow X_2$ is a continuous, we obtain a map $t(f):t(X_1)\longrightarrow t(X_2)$ by sending $Y\in t(X_1)$ to $cl(f(Y))$ in $X_2$. Thus $t$ is a functor on topological spaces. Further, we define a map $\alpha:X \longrightarrow t(X)$, by $\alpha(P)=cl\{P\}$. We see that $\alpha$ is continuous because for any closed subset $t(Y)$ of $t(X)$, $\alpha^{-1}(t(Y))=Y$, which is closed in $X$. Next they make the following statement : $\alpha$ induces a bijection between the set of open subsets of $X$ and the set of open subsets of $t(X)$. This is where I have doubts. I think it is enough to prove that there is a bijection between the corresponding closed sets. What I have so far is : if $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$, then $\alpha^{-1}(t(Y))=Y$, and $\alpha(Y)\subset t(Y)$. Also if $Y\neq Z$ closed subsets of $X$, I can show that $\alpha(Y)\neq\alpha(Z)$.

Then one of the following holds: (i) If the covering has an infinite number of sheets, then there exists a biholomorphic mapping $\varphi:X\to H$ of $X$ onto the left half plane such that the following diagram commutes 
  $$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{\varphi}>> H\\

  (ii) If the covering is $k$-sheeted( $k<\infty$), then there exists a biholomorphic mapping $\varphi:X\to D^*$ such that following diagram commutes, where $p_k:D^*\to D^*$ is the mapping $z\to z^k$ .

591168,Regularity theorem for Laplacian,"Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ be a bounded domain, $d>2$. Let $f \in C^\infty(\Omega)$. If $u \in L^2$ is a distributional solution of $\Delta u = f$ in $\Omega$ then $u \in C^\infty(\Omega)$ and it is a classical solution. This can be easily proved: we can explicitly specify one of the solutions of $\Delta u = f$ of class $С^\infty$, it is $u' = K*f$, where $K$ is the Newton kernel. Next we can easily show that any solution of $\Delta u = 0$ is $C^\infty$ from what we can derive that $u = u' + (u-u') \in C^\infty$. More precisely this procedure is described in these lecture notes, p.8, thm. 2. The situation is more complicated in the case when $f \in H^k$, where $H^k$ is the Sobolev space, $k \geq 0$. In this case I expect to show that if $u$ is a distributional solution of $\Delta u = f$ then $u \in H^{k+2}$ and $\Delta u = f$ a.e. As above we represent $u = u'+(u-u')$ where $u'$ is some particular distributional solution of $\Delta u = f$. The problem is to show that we can specify such particular solution in the class $H^{k+2}$. Formally we can take convolution of distributions $K*f$, but I'm not sure that $K*f \in H^{k+2}$ since $K$ is not in $L^2$ for $d \geq 4$. Is there a way to generalize the above approach to prove regularity in this Sobolev case? P.S. I know about other ways to prove regularity, e.g. [Bers, Schechter], but I'm interested if the approach for $C^\infty$ functions is easily extendable.","['sobolev-spaces', 'distribution-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

591313,"How many edges does an Erdős-Rényi graph have to have, to almost surely have a component with multiple cycles?","An Erdős-Rényi graph is a random graph, selected according to the distribution obtained one where we have some number $n$ of nodes, and some probability $p$ of each potential edge being present. One often asks questions of this distribution when $p$ is taken as a function of $n$, and we take the limit as $n \to \infty$. Classic results on properties of the graph which hold almost surely, from Erdős and Rényi's original paper on random graphs , are as follows: In the case that $p = (1 - \Omega(1)) \cdot \tfrac1n$, the graph consists almost entirely of trees of size $O(\log n)$, and a finite number of components which contain a single cycle. In the case that $p = (1 + \Omega(1)) \cdot \tfrac1n$, the graph consists of a single ""giant"" component which contains a positive fraction of all the vertices and has multiple cycles, together with a finite number of components which contain a single cycle and trees of size $O(\log n)$. It is clear from this that between $p = n^{-1} \pm \Theta(n^{-1})$, the probability that the graph contains a component which has multiple cycles goes from 0 to 1. Furthermore, for $p = \tfrac1n$ precisely, we expect the number of vertices which belong to a component which has a single cycle also to scale as $\Theta(n^{2/3})$: connecting any two of these vertices (even in the same component) will result in a component with two cycles, so for $n^{-1} + \omega(n^{-4/3})$, we should already expect to see components with multiple cycles. What I'm interested is: what is known about the growth of functions $f(n)$ for which $p = n^{-1} + \Theta(f(n))$ implies that there is almost surely a component with multiple cycles? How much better can we do than $f(n) \in \omega(n^{-4/3})$? For instance: by Theorem 8a of Erdős and Rényi's original paper on the evolution of random graphs, we would expect an increasing probability, bounded only by zero and one, of having a single cycle with at least one diagonal edge, for $p = \tfrac{1}{n}(1 + c\tfrac{1}{\sqrt n})$, for any constant $c$; this would show that any $f(n) \in \omega(n^{-3/2})$ would suffice. However, a problem with this Theorem was discovered by Łuczak and Wierman, so such a threshold does not seem to hold. It would also be unnecessarily restrictive even if true, as it would describe the special case of a component which has two cycles which overlap on an edge: one could hope to show the existence (for instance) of components with two cycles which may be attached to distant leaves of a large tree, with a smaller $f$. How small a function $f$ can we find a transition from every component being a tree or unicyclic, to there being components with multiple cycles?","['asymptotics', 'graph-theory', 'probability', 'random-graphs']"

$$
As $r \rightarrow 0$ and $R \rightarrow \infty$ we have that the second and fourth integrals go to zero. Thus,
$$
\pi b^{a-1} 2 i \sin (\pi i a/2) = 2 \int_0^{\infty}  \frac{x^a}{x^2 + b^2}dx  \implies \int_0^{\infty}  \frac{x^a}{x^2 + b^2}dx = \frac{\pi b^{a-1}  i \sin (\pi i a/2)}{2}
$$ So where did I go wrong?","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

591724,"Is there any nice characterization of the extension of $G/[G,G]$ by $[G,G]$ that equals $G$?","In this question, I asked whether a finite group $G$ could always be expressed as the semidirect product of its commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ and the abelian quotient group $G/[G,G]$.  The answer is no. So now we move on to the more general question, which is whether there is any nice characterization of the extension of $G/[G,G]$ by $[G,G]$ that equals $G$.  As I am interested in $G$ nonabelian, I realize the general extension problem is very hard.  But I am hoping that working with the commutator subgroup makes this problem easier.  The research I have done so far is not encouraging, however, so I can only be pleasantly surprised at this point! Motivation: It is tempting to think of the derived series of a finite group as decomposable into a ""product"" of abelian communtator quotient groups: $G=G/G'\times G'/G''\times ... \times G^{(n-1)}/G^{(n)} \times G^{(n)}$ where $G^{(n)}$ is the perfect group where the derived series terminates. If $G^{(n)}$ is not trivial, then $G$ is not solvable (and $G^{(n)}$ is necessarily nonabelian), and $G$ is solvable if $G^{(n)}$ is trivial.  In the latter solvable case, all the ""factors"" are abelian, but the ""product"" can be nonabelian.  If we could characterize the ""product"" as a semidirect product, then this interpretation might have some merit, but we cannot.  But if the extension I am asking about can be characterized, this idea might be salvagable: that solvable groups are not ""too nonabelian"" because their ""product"" has no nonabelian ""factors"". Thanks! More motivation: DonAntonio wonders what I am up to.  I believe that non-mathematicians hate/fear math mostly because it is boring. But what is boring is all the preliminary stuff you need to get through to see the beautiful stuff. Unfortunately, the beautiful stuff can be hard going without the preliminaries. So I am trying to develop an accessible presentation of Galois Theory: not to teach it thoroughly, but to show that there is really cool math hidden from view.  There are many steps to this.  This question deals with one of the last steps: why does the quintic formula become ""too complex"" to exist? The answer is that it is ""too nonabelian"": it contains a nonabelian ""factor"" that can't be eliminated (the perfect group of the derived series).  But there are groups that are solvable and nonabelian: they have abelian ""factors"" but nonabelian ""products"".  This all sounds good, but I'd like it to actually be correct!  I was hoping that semidirect products would fill the bill, but they don't.  At best, the characterization of the ""product"" of commutator quotient groups is going to be more complicated that I hoped, and at worst there will be no such characterization.  Even though I am trying to popularize, and am trying to simplify, I don't want to be wrong.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

591730,A congruence in the number of certain ternary strings,"Let $a_n$ be the number of ternary strings of length $n$ which do not contain three consecutive symbols that are all different.  That is, 
$$a_n = \Bigl|\bigl\{\,(b_k)_{1\leq k\leq n}\in \{0,1,2\}^n\mid (\forall k \in \{1,\ldots, n-2\}) (\{b_k, b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}\} \neq \{0, 1, 2\})\,\bigr\}\Bigr|.$$ Hence $a_1 = 3$, $a_2 = 9$, $a_3 = 21$, and so on.  One can show that these numbers satisfy the reccurence
$$a_{n+1} = 2a_n + a_{n-1}$$ and hence $$a_n = \frac{3}{2}\left((1+\sqrt{2})^n + (1-\sqrt{2})^n\right).$$ Now consider $a_p$ where $p\geq 3$ is a prime.  It follows by the binomial theorem that $$a_p \equiv 3 \pmod{p} \tag{*}$$ and a little more work gives that $a_p\equiv 3 \pmod{6p}$. What I want to know is the following: can we prove the congruence $(*)$ using purely combinatorial methods?  In particular, is there a natural way to partition the non-constant ternary strings of length $p$ satisfying the condition into equivalence classes of size $p$ (or sizes which are multiples of $p$ for clear combinatorial reasons)? The analogous problem where we allow the conditions to ""wrap around"" (i.e., we allow $k$ to be any positive integer in the definition and set $b_{n+i} = b_i$ for all $i$) is easy:  if the length of the string is a prime $p$, the natural action of $C_p$ on the set of such strings (namely, rotation) yields 3 orbits of size $1$ (the constant strings); the other orbits, since $p$ is prime, must have size $p$, so these orbits are our nice equivalence classes. The same sort of trick doesn't work in this case, since (for instance) the string $01112$ is allowed, but its rotation $11120$ is not.  Perhaps something more clever will allow us to get a nice combinatorial proof?","['combinatorial-proofs', 'elementary-number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

591839,Has the idea of generalizing the codomain of a metric been seriously considered?,"The long line is much longer than $\mathbb{R}$, and indeed many chains have this property. Thus, since metrics are usually assumed to be real-valued, this can be understood as an assumption that point-to-point distances are ""short"" in some sense. Presumably, this has a variety of benefits. For example, every metrizable space is paracompact , a smallness condition that apparently follows from the shortness of $\mathbb{R}$. However, I also think it has some drawbacks. There are many, many spaces that simply aren't metrizable. So I think that if we generalize the notion of a metric $d$ such that the codomain needn't be $\mathbb{R},$ this would make a larger class of spaces metrizable. Reference request. Has the idea of generalizing the codomain of a metric been seriously considered? If so, a link or reference would be appreciated. Remark . Its true that $\mathbb{R}$ is the unique Dedekind-complete linearly ordered field. So this would seem to put a kink in the idea. However, I think that $\mathbb{R}$ has much more structure than we really need to do metric space theory. In particular, every real number $x$ has an additive inverse $-x,$ and so long as $x$ is non-zero it has a multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$. I don't think either of these properties are truly necessarily for the codomain of a metric.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'reference-request']"
