250824,Algebraic independence and dimension of a variety,"A set of polynomials $\{f_1,\ldots,f_m\}$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ are algebraically independent over $k$ iff for all polynomials $p \in k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$, $p(f_1,\ldots,f_m) = 0$ implies that $p = 0$. In linear algebra, the dimension of a subspace of $k^n$ defined by $m$ linearly independent equations is $n - m$. Is the analogous statement in algebraic geometry true: that the dimension of a variety in $k^n$ defined by $m$ algebraically independent polynomials is $n - m$?

250828,Solving a polynomial equation with a parametrization,"Let $f(x,y)$ be an irreducible polynomial, in the two variables $x$ and $y$. 
It sometimes happens that a “lucky” change of variables $x=g(t)$, where $g$ is a non constant polynomial, transforms our irreducible equation in a nice completely factored equation : in other words, if $d$ is the degree of $f$ in $y$, there are univariate polynomials $c,h_1, \ldots ,h_d$ in $t$ such that the identity $$
f(g(t),y)=c(t)\prod_{k=1}^d (y-h_k(t))
$$ holds. Is an algorithm known to decide if such a $g$ exists, or even better, to compute it explicitly ? Update 20 :00 As noted in a comment below, the answer probably depends on the field. But I believe that this dependence is not very strong and I’m basically interested in an answer over any (zero characteristic) field.","['algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials']"

  accumulation point. But if $z$ is a boundary point and $B(z,r)\cap A=\{z\}$, then should not it follow that $r=0$? Otherwise there must be other point in the intersection. But in that case $z$ should also be an accumulation point because if we take $r>0$, $B(z,r)\cap A$

250940,Question Regarding Poisson and probability.,"i found this interesting question on the web but i am not quite sure if my solution is accurate. Honestly i would appreciate few opinions. Given Question: At a subway station, eastbound trains and northbound trains arrive
  independently, both according to a Poisson process. On average, there
  is one eastbound train every 12 minutes and one northbound train
  every 8 minutes.
  Suppose you arrive at the subway station at a certain point in time and
  start observing trains. Question: Find the probability at most  2 trains to reach the station within the next 10 minutes. So my attempted solution is pretty straight forward: I have calculated the Probability for EastBound train and then the probability for NorthBound train. 
So, where i am really stuck here is whether should i add those two probabilities or multiply them! For example i have calculated the probability for eastbound train as follows (in a very draft manner, please excuse me) $$\Bbb{P}_{east}= \big\{\Bbb{P}(N(10)=0)+\Bbb{P}(N(10)=1)+\Bbb{P}(N(10)=2)\big\}$$    .

250941,G is the product of its Sylow subgroups,"I want to prove the following: If every Sylow subgroup of $G$ is a normal subgroup, then $G$ is isomorphic to the product of its Sylow subgroups. So far, I have gotten to realize that for every prime factor $p_i$ of $|G|$, there is exactly one Sylow subgroup and that these form a partition of $G$. However, I am having trouble finding the isomorphism between $G$ and the product which I will call $G_1 \times \ldots \times G_r$. My idea was just to use the mapping $(g_1, \ldots, g_r) \mapsto g_1\ldots g_r$, which is a bijection, but I don't see whether it is a homomorphism. In general, not all elements of $G_i$ commute with elements of $G_j$, so one cannot simply change the order of the elements in the product.",['group-theory']
250942,Derivatives of functions involving absolute value,"I noticed that if the absolute value definition $\lvert{x}\rvert=\sqrt{x^2}$ is used, we can get derivatives of functions with absolute value, without having to redefine them as piece-wise. For example, to get the derivative of $f(x)=x\lvert{x}\rvert$ we write $f(x)=x(x^2)^\frac{1}{2}$ and thus $$
\begin{align}
f'(x) &= \sqrt{x^2}+x\frac{1}{2}(x^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(2x) \\
&=\sqrt{x^2}+\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2}} \\
&=\frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{x^2}} \\
&=\frac{2x^2}{\lvert{x}\rvert} \\
&=2\lvert{x}\rvert \\
\end{align}
$$ which is correct. You just have to avoid using the law of exponents to simplify $\lvert{x}\rvert = (x^2)^\frac{1}{2}=x^{2(\frac{1}{2})}=x$. My question is, why does using $\lvert{x}\rvert=\sqrt{x^2}$ to get derivatives work, and why does the law of exponents seem to show that $\lvert{x}\rvert=x$ ?","['absolute-value', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

250966,Proof that $\omega^\omega$ is completely metrizable and second countable,"I have almost solved the following problem but am stuck at the very end, can you help me finish it? Thank you for your help. Let $n<\omega$ and $t\in {}^n\omega$. We define $U_t=\{s\in {}^\omega\omega : t\subseteq s\}$. The family
  $\mathcal B=\{U_t : t\in\bigcup {}^n\omega\}$ is a basis for a topology $\tau$ on ${}^\omega\omega$. This means that a set $X$
  is in $\tau$ if and only if $X$ is a union of elements of $\mathcal B$. EXERCISE 50 (PG): Show that $\langle {}^\omega\omega,\tau \rangle$ is a second countable completely metrizable space. Hint: For $r,s\in {}^\omega\omega$ such that $r\ne s$, the $\varrho(r,s)=1/\min\{n : r(n)\ne s(n)\}$. Moreover, let $\varrho(r,r)=0$. 
  Show that $\varrho$ is a complete metric on ${}^\omega\omega$ that induces the topology $\tau$. (i) Second countable: the set of $n$-tuples is countable since it is a finite union of countable sets. (ii) complete with respect to $$ d(f,g) = \frac{1}{\min \{n \mid f(n) \neq g(n) \}}$$
Let $f_k$ be a Cauchy sequence. This means that the index at which $f_k, f_i$ differ gets larger as $i,k$ get larger. Let $f(n)$ denote the pointwise limit, that is, $\lim_{k \to \infty} f_k(n)$. Then $f(n) \in \omega$ for every $n$ since $f_k(n)$ is eventually constant. Hence $f \in \omega^\omega$. (iii) $d$ induces the same topolgy as $U_t$: $\tau_t \subset \tau_d$: Let $s \in U_t$. Then $B(s, \frac{1}{n+1})$ is an open ball contained in $U_t$ hence $U_t$ is open in $\tau_d$. $\tau_t \supset \tau_d$: Let $B(s, \frac{1}{k})$ be an open balls. If $k < n$, $s \in U_s \subset B(s, \frac{1}{k})$. But if $k \ge n$ then I'm stuck. The ball $B(s, \frac{1}{k})$ consists of all sequences that agree with $s$ on the first $k$ coordinates. So it is quite small. How do I make the $U_t$ small enough to fit in this ball? I have thought of intersection but since I'm only allowed to do finite intersections I don't see what to do.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'the-baire-space']"

Elements of order 6 (since a 6-cycle is impossible for 5 elements) must have at least an even cycle and a cycle of length divisible by 3, and 2 + 3 = 5, so elements of order 5 are a combination of 2-cycles and 3-cycles.

251361,"$Y \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$, $[X|Y=y] \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1/y).$ Find $f_X(x)$","This was a quiz question that I answered but don't understand something that is probably very important. Question: Let $Y \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ and $[X|Y=y] \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1/y).$ Find $f_X(x)$. Solution (Attempt): We have
$$f_X(x|y) = y$$
for $y \in (0,1)$ and $x \in (0,1/y)$. Then, $$f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x|y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y = \int_0^1 y \mathrm{d}y = \frac{1}{2}.$$ From here I argued that we need
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x = 1$$ so $X \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,2)$ will satisfy this condition. However, my professor has noted that $$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{2}$$ for $x \in [0,1]$ but I did not cover the case of $x > 1$ in which she then goes on to do the following: $$f_X(x) = \int_{0}^{ 1/x  } y \mathrm{d}y = \frac{1}{2x^2}$$
for $x > 1$. Trying to understand this, it makes me think that the former case that I did, was just for the case of $y = 1$ and then the part that professor did was for $y \in (0,1).$ But that isn't making that much sense as it seems then the integral I computed would have just been $1$. I am guessing something is happening where $X$ is distributed on some interval $(0,1/y)$ which ends at $1/y$ which varies and could be a large number.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

    return count {count is the number of 1s in S} Here S-1 is the bit string obtained by changing the rightmost 1 bit of S to a 0 and all the 0 bits to right of this to 1s. So I understand why this is correct, and I have write a rough explanation; After every iteration, the rightmost 1 bit in S, as well as all the bits to the right of it, is set equal to 0. Thus, after each iteration, the next right-most 1 is accounted for and set to 0, until the entire string is 0's and the loop breaks with the count equal to the number of 1's. I know this kind of answer won't pass in any mathematics community, so I was hoping to write a formal proof, but I don't know how to go about doing that.  My proof skills are particularly shoddy, so an explanation of the techniques involved would be greatly appreciated.","['induction', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing', 'algorithms']"

My first guess was to solve $2\pi = \sum_i (2\sin^{-1} \frac{r_i}{r_i+r_{inner}})$ for $r_{inner}$, but that's beyond my skills.

Prove that $f^{-1}(x)$ is also differentiable at $b$. I read the proof in Spivak Calculus book, but it's quite confusing to me. Then I looked up online, and I saw exact the same proof everywhere. So I wonder is there an alternative proof to this problem that I'm not aware of? Here is the proof from Spivak book Theorem 5 (Calculus by Spivak 4th edition, page 237-238) Proof. Let $b = f(a)$. Then
    $$\displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0} \dfrac{f^{-1}(b + h) - f^{-1}(b)}{h} = \displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0} 
	\dfrac{f^{-1}(b + h) - a}{h}$$
    Now every number $b + h$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$ can be written in the form
    $$b + h = f(a + k)$$
    for a unique $k$. Then
    $$\displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0} \dfrac{f^{-1}(b + h) - a}{h} 
	= \displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f^{-1}(f(a + k)) - a}{f(a + k) - b} 
	= \displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0} \dfrac{k}{f(a + k) - f(a)}$$
    We have
    $$f^{-1}(b + h) = a + k \Leftrightarrow k = f^{-1}(b + h) - f^{-1}(b)$$
    Since $f$ is continuous and one-one, $f^{-1}$ is also continuous at $b$. This means that $k$ approaches $0$ as $h$ approaches $0$. Since
    $$\displaystyle\lim_{k\to 0} \dfrac{f(a + k) - f(a)}{k} = f'(a) = f'(f^{-1}(b)) \neq 0$$
    this implies that

Just after the definition of a Lévy process he says the following: If $X_t$ is a Lévy-process and we consider the function $f_t(u)=\mathbb{E}(e^{iuX_t})$ where $f_0(u)=1$ and $f_{t+s}(u)=f_t(u)f_s(u)$, and $f_t(u) \neq 0$ for every $(t,u)$. Then, using the right continuity in probability we conclude that there exists a continuous function $\psi$ with $\psi(0)=0$ such that $f_t(u)=\text{exp}(-t\psi(u))$. How can one prove this? (Right) continuity in probability seems a rather weak notion to me for the existence of a fully continuous $\psi(u)$. It would mean that also $f_t(u)$ is continuous right?

\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b) &= \int_0^\infty \exp(-x)x^{a-1} \, dx \int_0^\infty \exp(-y)y^{b-1} \, dy  \\
   &= \ints \exp(-x)x^{a-1}  \exp(-y)y^{b-1} \, dx\,dy \\
   &= \ints e^{-t} x^{a-1}(t-x)^{b-1} \, dt\,dx
\end{align*} Now if we make the variable change $x=\mu t$
\begin{align*}
\ints e^{-t} x^{a-1}(t-x)^{b-1} \, dt\,dx &= \ints e^{-t} (\mu t)^{a-1} (t-\mu t)^{b-1} t \, dt\, d\mu \\
   &= \ints e^{-t} t^{a+b-1}  \mu^{a-1} (1-\mu)^{b-1} \, d\mu \, dt

&= \underbrace{\int_0^\infty  e^{-t} t^{a+b-1} \,dt}_{\Gamma(a+b)} \underbrace{\int_0^\infty \mu^{a-1} (1-\mu)^{b-1} \, d\mu}_{\text{limits are not from 0 to 1}}

This (projective plane) model helps the students in understanding what multiplicity of a zero/asymptote really means.  I later use the same projective plane model to show how all conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, lines) are related.  I get very nice feedback on this, and the students seem to really enjoy it. I have not, however, been able to find similar motivating examples for introducing complex numbers. I know there must be similar (pictorial!) arguments to engage the students and pique their curiosity, but I haven't found it yet.  Simply saying ""all polynomials have a zero over the complex numbers"" doesn't really do it for them (again, the more pictures involved, the better).

The problem I am having is that the universal property of free groups involves set functions from $\{G,H\}$ to groups, whereas the univeral property for coproducts involves homomorphisms from $G$ and $H$.

Questions, in order of interest: Does this sum simplify? Can someone give a nice interpretation of this sum?  (Perhaps a combinatorial one?) Does anyone know any references involving this sum? Here's are some things I've dug up. When $x = 1$ , we get $$\sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n}{j} \left\{ j \atop k \right\} = \left\{ n+1 \atop k+1 \right\}.$$ This is formula 6.15, p. 265, of Concrete Mathematics .

The sum satisfies the recurrence $$S(n,k,x) = (xk+1)S(n-1,k,x) + x S(n-1,k-1,x) + [n=k=0].$$ These are all interesting facts, but I would like to put some kind of interpretation on the sum or place it in some larger context.","['stirling-numbers', 'recurrence-relations', 'generating-functions', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

So, I'm trying to determine: $$ \int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx $$ Integrate by parts, where $u = 1/x$, and $v \, ' = e^x$. Then $u \, ' = - 1/x^2$, and $v=e^x$. So, $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \int{\frac{e^x}{x^2}} \, dx$$ Integrate by parts again, $u = 1/x^2$, $v \, ' = e^x$, so that $u \, ' = -2/x^3$ and $v=e^x$. So, $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + 2\int{\frac{e^x}{x^3}} \, dx$$ Repeat this process ad infinitum to get, $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + 2 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^3} + 3 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^4} + 4 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^5} + \, \cdots \right) \right) \right) $$ Expanding this gives, $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + \frac{2e^x}{x^3} + \frac{6 e^x}{x^4} + \frac{24 e^x}{x^5} + \cdots $$ And factoring that gives, $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} \left(  1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x^2} + \frac{6}{x^3} + \frac{24}{x^4} + \cdots \right) $$ Now, considering the series itself, the ratio between the $n^{th}$ term and the $(n-1)^{th}$ term = $\Large \frac{n}{x}$. Eventually, $n$ will be larger than $x$, so the ratio between successive terms will be positive, so (assuming $x$ is positive), the series diverges, meaning (and I'm sure everybody will cringe upon seeing notation used like this), that: $$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} \left( \infty \right) = \infty $$","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'integration', 'fake-proofs']"

Consider $V \subset H \subset V^*$ , where $V$ is Banach and $H$ is Hilbert. $V$ is dense in $H$ . Why do we need density of $V$ ? Assume the injection $V \subset H$ is continuous. There is a canonical map $T:H^* \to V^*$ that just restricts functionals on $H$ to take arguments restricted to $V$ . $T$ has the properties:
(1) $|Tf|_{V^*} \leq C|f|_{H^*},$ (2) $T$ is injective,
(3) $R(T)$ is dense in $V^*$ if $V$ is reflexive. Why do we need $V \subset H$ to be continuous? What's the need for these three properties? I'm not asking ""why are they true"" but what is the significance of these properties for this discussion? The second one is fine, I suppose. I guess the third property is nice as it says we can get close as want to to an element of $V^*$ by elements on $H^*$ , but so what? Identifying $H^*$ with $H$ and using $T$ as a canonical embedding from $H^*$ into $V^*$ , we write $V \subset H \equiv H^* \subset V^*$ , where all injections are continuous and dense. Why is continuous and dense worth pointing out? The situation is more delicate if $V$ turns out to be a Hilbert space with its own inner product. We could identify $V$ and $V^*$ with this inner product, but then the Hilbert triple becomes absurd. We cannot simulataneously identify both $V$ and $H$ with their dual spaces. Here is a very instructive example. Let $H = \ell^2$ , with $(u,v)_H = \sum u_nv_n$ and $V = \{u : \sum n^2u_n^2 < \infty\}$ with $(u,v)_V = \sum n^2u_nv_n.$ Clearly $V \subset H$ is dense and continuous injection.
