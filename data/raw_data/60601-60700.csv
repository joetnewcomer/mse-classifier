677747,U-substitution for integral of 1/(1+e^x)dx. What am I doing wrong?,"Here is my work, with the right answer. I feel like every step is right, but somehow I am getting the wrong answer. How? $$ \int \frac{1}{1+e^z}dz = \int\frac{1}{e^z(\frac{1}{e^z} + 1)}dz  
=\int\frac{1}{\frac{1}{e^z} + 1}\frac{1}{e^z}dz $$
subbing $u = \frac{1}{e^z} + 1$, $\frac{du}{dz} = -e^{-z}dz \implies -du = \frac{1}{e^z}dz$ so $$\int \frac{1}{1+e^z}dz = -\int\frac{1}{u}du = -\ln(u) + C = -\ln(e^{-z}+1) + C$$ But the right answer is $z - \ln(1+e^z)+C$","['logarithms', 'calculus', 'integration']"
677763,Deciding to place a bet on outcome of a dice roll based on the probability,"I have encountered several question of the following format. I have no trouble answering the first half but second half I have no clue on how to proceed. a: If you roll 5 standard six-sided dice, what is the probability of getting at least three 2s? b: If the roller gives you $10 on getting at least three 2's but asks only $2 in return if you lose. Would you take the bet? Why or why not? First part is just an application of binomial theorem and you are done. The probability is 0.03549 . But how to go about second part.
Does it make sense to also take into consideration that if I win only once and lose other 5 times then also I will have not lost anything in the end. It will be evened out. Answers with complete explanation would be the best. If not, then please provide pointers to relevant readings.","['dice', 'probability', 'gambling']"
677768,Question about the logic behind hypothesis testing,"Let us say that we have this following problem: ""A government agency claims that more than 50% of US tax returns were filed electronically last year. A random sample of 150 tax returns for last year contained 86 that were filed electronically. Test the claim at $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level."" In this problem our null hypothesis is: $H_0 : p \leq 0.50$ and $H_a : p > 0.50$. I've calculated the sample proportion : $\frac{x}{n} = \frac{86}{150} = 0.573$ and the standard error: $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.0408$. Now my z-score is 1.79 which is greater than $z=1.64$, so I'm ""required to reject the null hypothesis."" But my question is how do I know that 86 out of 150 is not an unusual sampling to begin with? Why can't we reject the random sampling and support the claim given by $H_0$? My last question deals with what to do with $H_a$. Once $H_0$ has been rejected do we say that there is ""sufficient evidence for $H_a$"" or do we say that ""$H_a$ is true but under these conditions :""?",['statistics']

677796,Is there a continuous injective map from $\mathbb{R}$ that has compact image?,"Suppose I have a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to X$, where $X$ is some non-compact metric space. Is it possible that $f$ is injective yet has compact image? If the answer is yes, what characterizes those cases? What additional properties would make the answer negative? My progress so far: If the image is compact, $f(n)$ has a convergent subsequence with limit in the image, i.e. $f(a_n) \to f(a)$ where $a_n \to \infty$.

677807,Prove that for every integer greater than 1. $\dbinom{n}{1}-2\dbinom{n}{2}+3\dbinom{n}{3}+.....+(-1)^{n-1}n\dbinom{n}{n}=0$,How do you show the following. Prove that for every integer greater than 1. $\dbinom{n}{1}-2\dbinom{n}{2}+3\dbinom{n}{3}+.....+(-1)^{n-1}n\dbinom{n}{n}=0$ My idea is that is that the whole sequence seem to alternate but it end as a negative. So if the whole sequence adds up it will probably be negative one since it starts positive and ends negative. And the the greatest integer function of (-1) is zero. But I am not sure how to prove the following. I did the binomial theorem for $(1-x)^n$ and got $\dbinom{n}{0}1^{n}(-x)^{(0)}+\dbinom{n}{1}1^{n-1}(-x)^{(1)}+\dbinom{n}{2}1^{n-2}(-x)^{(2)}+\dbinom{n}{3}1^{n-3}(-x)^{(3)}+.....+\dbinom{n}{k}1^{n-k}(-x)^{(k)}$ but I find myself a bit stuck as the odds and even do not match. then I got $\dbinom{n}{0}1^{n}+\dbinom{n}{1}1^{n-1}(-x)+\dbinom{n}{2}1^{n-2}(x^2)+\dbinom{n}{3}1^{n-1}(-x^3)+\dbinom{n}{k} 1^{n-k}(x^k)$ ok I differentiated and I got $\dbinom{n}{1}-2\dbinom{n}{2}x+3\dbinom{n}{3}x^2-4x^3\dbinom{n}{4}+.....+\dbinom{n}{k} k x^{k-1}$,['combinatorics']
677815,Do two distinct level sets determine a non-constant complex polynomial?,"Let $f$ and $g$ be non-constant complex polynomials in one variable. Let $a\neq b$ be complex numbers and suppose $f^{-1}(a)=g^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)=g^{-1}(b)$. Does this imply $f=g$? If we think of entire functions instead of polynomials, the answer is negative: take $e^{-z}$ and $e^{z}$ and they share the same level sets for 0 and 1. More generally, Nevanlinna's 5-values theorem says that 5 level sets completely determine a non-constant meromorphic function. Can we lower this number when dealing with polynomials?","['complex-analysis', 'polynomials']"
677817,How to properly construct an $\epsilon-N$ proof,"I've asked a couple of questions now on this type of proof. My question is: could someone give me a step-by-step set of steps to follow in the general case (e.g. for proof by induction, I'd say the 3 main steps are: check the statement's true in the base cas, assume the result is true for $n$, and then finally show $P(n)\implies P(n+1)$). Is there a general recipe for $\epsilon-N$ proofs? All I know is that we need to show that $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$.",['real-analysis']
677845,impossible ODE using delta functions?,"I'm working on the problems in the book ""Asymptotic Methods of Differential Equations"", by Roscoe White. It's a pretty legit book, and all the problems are quite non-trivial and very rich. However, two of the problems in Chapter 2 (which talks about exact solutions and has quite a bit on delta functions and Greens functions), are really vexing me at the moment. They are stated quite unceremoniously as: $6.$ solve $x^3 y' = 2y^2 + 3x^2 = 0$ $7.$ solve $y' = 2xy + y = 0$ for $y = y(x)$. (I triple checked the two lines above, they are typed exactly as written in the pages of the book) Now since the chapter that this problem set was placed in talks extensively about Greens functions, it seems that I'm supposed to construct some crazy solution out of delta functions and step functions. However, after trying for about half an hour, I tried checking these equations for consistency, and noted that if you differentiate the second equation in problem $6$ and multiply by $x^3$, it seems that there is a contradiction. Similarly, if you differentiate the second equation in Problem 7, it seems that the only possible solution is the trivial $y = 0$. Now if this were some random problem set cobbled together by a TA, then I would probably just move on and assume it was sloppiness on the part of whoever created these. However, the context of the problems tells me that I'm missing something, and there may an non-trivial solution to these. Can anyone take a look and tell me what I'm supposed to do here? Thanks.","['dirac-delta', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
677852,How to calculate relative error when true value is zero?,How do I calculate relative error when the true value is zero? Say I have $x_{true} = 0$ and $x_{test}$. If I define relative error as: $\text{relative error} = \frac{x_{true}-x_{test}}{x_{true}}$ Then the relative error is always undefined.

677884,Is it obvious that $\sum_n x_n = 0 $ when $x_n = 0 ~ \forall n \in \mathbb N$?,"Until recently I used to think that because of induction, a statement $P_n$ which is true $\forall n \in \mathbb N$ was also true when $n \to \infty$. Life was simple, and I was happy. Then someone (on this website) showed me a counterexample with $P_n = $ ""$\sum_1^n$ is finite"". I was shocked and confused. My current understanding is that knowing that a statement is true $\forall n \in \mathbb N$ doesn't automatically imply that it is true when $n \to \infty$. The latter case might also be true, but needs a separate proof. Now please help me understand the following two statements: if $x_n = 0 ~ \forall n \in \mathbb N$, then $\lim_n x_n = 0 $ if $x_n = 0 ~ \forall n \in \mathbb N$, then $\sum_n x_n = 0 $ These two statements seem obvious but I don't trust ""obvious"" anymore.

677921,How I cut my orange - spherical volume integral,"I cut my orange in six eatable pieces, following some rules. My orange is a perfect sphere, and there is a cylindrical volume down through my orange, that is not eatable. In the diagram, the orange with radius, $R$ is shown as seen from the top. The circle with radius, $r$ is the non-eatable center. All lines are vertical cuts to be made. The red area is the final waste. Many of the cuts are tangential to the non-eatable center to minimize waste. The pieces are labeled $1\ldots6$ . and the angles for each pieces are labeled $\alpha_{1\ldots7}$ . I want to optimize my cuts, so that the volume of the pieces are similar. I denote the volume of piece $n$ as $V_n$ . It can be done, so that $V_1=V_2=V_3$ and $V_4=V_5=V_6$ . The first half: The volume of $V_1+V_2+V_3$ can easily be calculated from the spherical cap formula : $(V_1+V_2+V_3) = \pi/3(R-r)^2(2R+r)$ To calculate $\alpha_1$ , all I need is the volume, $V_1$ of the skewed spherical wedge as a function of $\alpha_1$ . How do I set up this integral? The second half: Making $V_4=V_5=V_6$ is a lot more complicated, but I would like to know how to make the volume integral that allows me to calculate volumes like $V_4$ and $V_5$ . The final cut: My intuition says, that making the final cut, where the waste is separated from piece 6. is best done by making $\alpha_6 = \alpha_7$ . Does that really minimize the waste?","['spherical-geometry', 'volume', 'integration']"
677927,Bibliography for Singular Functions [closed],"Closed. This question is off-topic . It is not currently accepting answers. This question does not appear to be about math within the scope defined in the help center . Closed 10 years ago . Improve this question I wound up assembling a rather lengthy and partially annotated bibliography for my answer to the math StackExchange question Singular continuous functions , but it seems I got a little too carried away and found myself with a post well over the maximum of 30,000 characters. Thus, I'm using this ""question"" to post the full bibliography, which I think could be a useful reference to others. I am including a large portion of the bibliography in the question because I still have too many characters otherwise. SOME HISTORY It is easy to construct non-decreasing continuous functions with a zero derivative almost everywhere, and such functions have numerous appearances in the literature beginning around 1883/1884 in papers by Cantor and Scheeffer (separately authored). See Fleron (1994) [27] and Maurey/Tacchi (2002) [54] . On the other hand, the first proof of the existence of strictly increasing continuous functions with a zero derivative almost everywhere seems to be in Ernst Hellinger's 1907 Ph.D. Dissertation, but I haven't looked into this to see exactly what he proved and where in the Dissertation it can be found. (Minkowski's function came earlier, but it wasn't proved to have this property until Denjoy proved it in 1934/1938 [17] [18] .) Likely unaware of Hellinger's result, Denjoy gave such a function in 1915 [15] . Other early examples of such functions are given in Sierpinski (1916; cites Denjoy) [73] , Hahn (1921; cites no one) [32] , Rajchman (1921; cites Denjoy and Sierpinski) [64] , Vitali (1922; I have not seen this paper) [77] , and Blumberg (1926; cites no one) [2] . Blumberg's example is the first such function I know of that appeared in English. Curiously, I found this seemingly straightforward historical issue of priority especially difficult to uncover. Other than items published recently (last 10 years or so), the only explicit statement of priority I've seen is Salem (1943, p. 427, footnote) [68] , who credits Denjoy with giving the first example.

Accessed 15 February 2014. [2] Henry Blumberg, Non-measurable functions connected with certain functional equations , Annals of Mathematics (2) 27 #3 (March 1926), 199-208. In a Note (pp. 206-208) at the end of the paper Blumberg constructs a function that he then proves is strictly increasing, continuous, and has a zero derivative almost everywhere. This particular appearance (in English!) of such a function seems to have been missed by authors who cite early appearances of such functions. A footnote on the first page says that the paper was read ""in part"" on 1 December 1917, so it is possible that Blumberg was in possession of this example back in 1917. However, the footnote does explicitly say in part , and the abstract for this paper in Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 24 #5 (February 1918) [ see abstract #8 on p. 220 ] does not mention the example, so in my opinion the evidence is not very strong that Blumberg was in possession of the example in 1917.

Various Baire category results (in various function spaces) relating to the properties of bounded variation, absolute continuity, and having a bounded derivative. [4] Ralph Philip Boas, Differentiability of jump functions , Colloquium Mathematicum 8 #1 (1961), 81-82. This paper gives an elementary proof (no use of differentiating monotonic functions; no use of integration; no use of Lebesgue density) that the derivative of a non-decreasing jump function is zero almost everywhere. See Lipinski (1957, 1961), Marczewski (1955), Pu/Pu (1983), Pu (1980-81), Piranian (1966), and Rubel (1963). The relevance of these papers here is that any non-decreasing function $f$ can be written as $f = A + S + J,$ where $A$ is non-decreasing and absolutely continuous, $S$ is non-decreasing and continuous and has a zero derivative almost everywhere, and $J$ is a non-decreasing jump function (also called a saltus function). This decomposition is unique up to the addition or subtraction of constant functions to $A,$ $S,$ and $J.$ Roughly speaking, this is a decomposition of the function $f$ into a continuous function $A$ that is ""maximally nice"" for certain integration purposes, a continuous function $S$ that is ""maximally bad"" for certain integration purposes, and a function $J$ that is the ""discontinuous part"" of the original function $f.$ An absolutely continuous function is continuous and also nice in many other ways. For example, an absolutely continuous function is finitely differentiable almost everywhere. Of course, any non-decreasing function is also finitely differentiable almost everywhere, but this property is true for absolutely continuous functions even when no additional monotonicity condition is assumed. By way of contrast, recall that a continuous function can be nowhere differentiable. An absolutely continuous function $A$ also satisfies the following version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $\int_{a}^{b}A'(x)dx = A(b) - A(a)$ (Lebesgue integration). A singular function $S$ fails to satisfy this Fundamental Theorem of Calculus version in the worst way: For any interval $[a,b]$ on which $S$ is defined, we have $\int_{a}^{b}S'(x)dx = 0$ (Lebesgue integration). A jump function is the sum of a constant function and a function that can be defined in the following way. Let $Z$ be a nonempty countable (finite or infinite) set of real numbers and let $B = \{b_{z}: \; z \in Z\}$ be a set of positive real numbers such that $Z$ and $B$ have the same number of elements (same cardinality) and the sum of all the numbers in $B$ is finite (of course, this is automatic if $B$ is a finite set). For each $z \in Z$ define the function $f_z$ by $f_{z}(x) = 0$ if $x < z$ and $f_{z}(x) = b_z$ if $x \geq z.$ Finally, a jump function is (any constant function added to) the zero function or a function that equals $\sum_{z \in Z}f_{z}$ for some choice of the sets $Z$ and $B.$ It can be shown that such a function $J$ is continuous at each point not belonging to $Z,$ and $J$ is discontinuous at each $z \in Z$ with $\limsup_{x \rightarrow z}J(x) - \liminf_{x \rightarrow z}J(x) = b_{z}.$ [5] Andrew Michael Bruckner and John Lander Leonard, On differentiable functions having an everywhere dense set of intervals of constancy , Canadian Mathematical Bulletin 8 #1 (February 1963), 73-76. Let $P$ be a perfect nowhere dense subset of $[0,1]$ (i.e. $P$ is a Cantor set). They prove the following result. There exists a function $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ that (i) $f$ is constant on each open interval contiguous to $P$ $(f$ can have different constant values on different contiguous intervals) AND (ii) $f$ is not constant on each open interval containing a point of $P$ AND (iii) $f$ is finitely differentiable on $(0,1)$ IF AND ONLY IF $P$ has the property that the intersection of $P$ with every open subinterval of $[0,1]$ has positive Lebesgue measure (i.e. $P$ is ""measure dense"", also called ""metrically dense""). This has the following implication for the Cantor staircase function $F$ (defined by making use of the usual Cantor middle thirds set that has measure zero). No matter how we redefine the values of $F$ at points in the Cantor set, it is not possible to change (or to ""smooth out"") the continuous function $F$ in such a way that we will get a finitely differentiable function, even though $F$ has a zero derivative almost everywhere.

[11] Richard Brian Darst, Some Cantor sets and Cantor functions , Mathematics Magazine 45 #1 (January 1972), 2-7. This is an expository paper. Darst begins with a discussion of arc length (defined as the least upper bound of the lengths of polygonal paths with vertices on the graph), then the Cantor middle thirds set is described, then the Cantor staircase function from $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$ is described and shown to have length $2$ and shown to have no finite two-sided derivative at any point of the Cantor middle thirds set. In the last section of the paper (pp. 5-7), Darst considers Cantor sets defined by removing (from the various closed intervals at each construction stage) centrally located open intervals whose lengths are a fixed proportion $0 < \lambda \leq 1$ of those removed when constructing the Cantor middle thirds set. When $\lambda = 1$ we obtain the Cantor middle thirds set, and when $0 < \lambda < 1$ we obtain a Cantor set with Lebesgue measure $1 - \lambda.$ Darst then shows that the length of the corresponding Cantor function from $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$ is $\lambda + \sqrt{1 + (1-\lambda)^{2}}$ and, when $\lambda < 1,$ Darst shows that the two-sided derivative of the corresponding Cantor function is $\frac{1}{1 - \lambda}$ at almost every point of the Cantor set associated with $\lambda.$ (Here, ""almost every point"" means the complement of the set of points has Lebesgue measure zero.)

678032,The closure of a connected set in a topological space is connected,"This problem is from Rudin. I am trying to Prove that the closure of a connected set is always connected. Here is my proof. Let $E$ be a connected set in a space $X$. Suppose to the contrary that the closure of $E$, $\overline{E}$ is not connected. Then there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $\overline{E}=A \cup B$ and $\overline{A}\cap B= \emptyset=A\cap\overline{B}$. $E$ being connected, we know that $A\cup B \neq E$ so there exist $p \in \overline{E} \backslash E$. We also know that $\overline{E}=E\cup E'$ (where $E'$ is the set of the limit points of $E$) so $p$ must be a limit point of $E$ (but not in $E$). Taking the set of all such $p$ we obtain the set $E''=\{p|p\in E', p\not \in E\}$. We find then that $E'' \subset A$ or $E'' \subset B$. Say $E'' \subset A$. Then $E \subset B$ and we see that $A\cap\overline{B}\neq \emptyset$ which is a contradiction. So $\overline{E}$ must be connected. Can anyone help me critique this proof? I feel uneasy about it but I don't know exactly what is wrong with it. Thank-you","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

678081,Name/significance of integral of the square of a probability density function,"Background/Motivation Given a probability density function $f(x)$, the mean of the corresponding random variable is the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of the region under the graph of $f$. I wondered: ""does the $y$-coordinate have any significance in probability?"". Of course, the $y$-coordinate is given by $\frac12\int_{-\infty}^\infty f^2$, so without worrying about the $1/2$, I wondered if the integral of $f^2$ itself has any significance. An internet search brought up only this physics forum thread and this yahoo answer , neither of which seemed to have any useful information. My thoughts One thing I thought about was the discrete case. Then $\Sigma_n p(n)^2$ is a probability, analogous to the probability of rolling doubles. Unfortunately, $\int f^2$ can easily be more than 1, so it does not have such a nice interpretation. I also considered uniform distributions. A uniform distribution of probability density equal to $p$ has square-integral $(1/p)*p^2=p$, so that maybe this square integral is something like ""the density of the uniform distribution $f$ is most like"". Flipping this idea on its head, a uniform distribution over an interval of length $1/p$ has square-integral $p$, so that the reciprocal of the square-integral is like the length of the uniform distribution with the same$\ldots$""clumpiness""? (It reminded me of curvature, being the reciprocal of the radius of the circle with the same curviness.) But I don't know if these interpretations are useful in any way.

678120,The total variation and the integral of the derivative,"I need a hint (not a complete solution) of the following problem: EDIT: when I was posting the question, I found I suddenly got it, so I need some verification. Suppose $F$ is a complex -valued function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$. Then the total variation $T_F(a,b)\ge\int_a^b\lvert F'(x)\rvert\,dx$. If $F$ is real -valued, then the problem is somewhat easier. Suppose the positive and the negative variation of $F$ on $[a,x]$ is $G(x),H(x)$, then $T_F(a,x)=G(x)+H(x)$ and $F(x)=G(x)-H(x)$, hence $$\int_a^b\lvert F'(x)\rvert\,dx\le\int_a^bG'(x)\,dx+\int_a^bH'(x)\,dx\le (G(b)-G(a))+(H(b)-H(a))=T_F(a,b)$$ We have used the following lemma: Suppose $F$ is increasing on $[a,b]$, then $\int_a^bF'(x)\,dx\le F(b)-F(a)$. It could be proved as follows: First, extend $F$ to $[a,+\infty)$, such that $f(x)=f(b),\;\forall x\ge b$. By Fatou's lemma, \begin{align}
\int_a^bF'(x)\,dx
&=\int_a^b\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(x+1/n)-f(x)}n\,dx\\
&\le\liminf_{n\to\infty}n\left(\int_{a+1/n}^{b+1/n}f-\int_a^bf\right)\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}n\left(\int_b^{b+1/n}f-\int_a^{a+1/n}f\right)\\
&=F(b)-F(a^+)
\end{align} I cannot apply the same technique to telescope the terms when $F$ is complex-valued. Note that when $F$ is absolutely continuous, then $T_F(a,b)\ge\int_a^b\lvert F'\rvert$ (in fact, $T_F(a,b)=\int_a^b$). The following argument should work: Denote $\lVert f\rVert=\lVert f\rVert_{L^1}=\int_a^b\lvert F'\rvert$. Since $F$ is AC, therefore of BC, hence $F'\in L^1$, fix $\epsilon>0$, we could choose step function $g$ s.t. $\lVert F'-g\rVert\le\epsilon$, and supose $g$ induces the partition $a=t_0<\dotsb<t_N=b$, we have $$\lVert F'\rVert\le\lVert F'-g\rVert+\lVert g\rVert\le\epsilon+\sum_{k=1}^N\left\lvert\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}g\right\rvert\le2\epsilon+\sum_{k=1}^N\left\lvert\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}F'\right\rvert\le2\epsilon+T_F(a,b)$$ It needs some explanation on the last step, i.e.: If $F$ is of BV, then $\lvert\int_a^bF'\rvert\le\lvert F(b)-F(a)\rvert$. By the real case, the real part and the imaginery part satisfy the preceding inequality, and note that $\lvert a\rvert\le\lvert a'\rvert, \lvert b\rvert\le\lvert a'\rvert\implies \lvert a+bi\rvert\le\lvert a'+b'i\rvert$.",['real-analysis']

In reality, number of input variables is slightly larger (seasonal changes that affect customers' demand, competitors prices that are also tabulated, let's say up to 6 input variables).

I was working on a problem in complex analysis, in which I needed the fifth root of a complex number in rectangular coordinates. Long story short, I eventually  reasoned that, being in rectangular form I could easily know $\cos\theta$, $\theta$ being the argument. So I now just needed to find $$\cos{\frac{\theta}5}$$ So I said: Oh, I'll just look up one of those handy trig identities and that's that. Well, the identity for this one wasn't to be found anywhere, or any identities of fractions of angles other than the half angle. So, taking inspiration from the half angle formula's deduction, I expanded $\cos5x$ using sum and double angle identities, which gave: $$\cos5x=16\cos ^5x-20\cos^3x+5\cos x$$
Unsurprisingly I later found that there were tables of such polynomials, and even recursion relations for the general form, and similarly for other trig functions. To my dismay though,  I now had to solve a $5$-th degree polynomial in order to find $\cos x/5$. Every time this happens to me I recall the original exasperation I felt when I learned that no closed form existed for degree $5$ and up. It really pains me. Back to the main question though, is the problem of finding expressions for trigonometric functions of fractions of angles really so non-trivial ?

Let $p$ be the point $(1:0:1:0)\in X$, and let $Y$ be the plane $\{x=0\}$. Stereographic projection from $p$ gives a birational map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. If I have calculated correctly, the map $X\mapsto Y$ is given by $$(x:y:z:w)\mapsto (0:y:z-x:w)$$ and the inverse $f^{-1}$ is given by $$(0:r:s:t)\mapsto (r^2-s^2-t^2:2rs:r^2+s^2-t^2:2st)$$ The original map is regular away from $p$. It seems to me that the inverse is regular away from $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$. What I want to know is why , from a geometric perspective, these are the only two points where the map is not regular. Geometrically, what is stopping $f^{-1}$ from being regular at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ and only these points? In more detail, here is my thinking and what I still want to understand: $f$ induces a bijection from points $q$ of $X$ to points $q'$ of $Y$ such that $q'$ is the intersection of $Y$ with the line through $p,q$ and $q$ is the intersection of the line through $p,q'$ with $X$ other than $p$. Any point $q$ of $X$ other than $p$ will give us a unique line through $p,q$ that hits $Y$ in a unique point $q'$, and this same line will determine $q$ from $q'$. Furthermore, every line through $p$ will hit $Y$ somewhere, and unless it is a tangent to $X$ at $p$ it will also hit $X$ at a second point $q$. It seems to me that this means that $f$ gives an isomorphism from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y$ minus the $\mathbb{P}^1$'s worth of points where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it. If I have calculated correctly, the points of $Y$ where the tangents to $X$ at $p$ hit it are given by $\{s=0\}$. So $f$ is giving a bijection from $X\setminus\{p\}$ to $Y\setminus\{s=0\}$, which is an affine plane. This explains why $f$ is regular away from $p$ and why $f^{-1}$ is regular away from $\{s=0\}$. What it does not explain is why $f^{-1}$ is also regular on $\{s=0\}$ except at $(0:1:0:\pm 1)$ . Any point $q'$ of $Y$ determines a line through $p,q'$. This line either hits $X$ twice or else is tangent to $X$ at $p$. I would have thought that whenever it is tangent to $X$ at $p$, then $f^{-1}(q')$ would be $p$; so that $f^{-1}$ should really be regular on all of $Y$. So, What is going wrong when I take $q'=(0:1:0:\pm 1)$? Thanks in advance.","['algebraic-geometry', 'birational-geometry']"

Question: This is the last part of a 5 part question I am working on.
Let $(X,\mu)$ be a possibly infinite measure space. Assume $\exists r < \infty$ with $\|f\|_r < \infty$ and that $\|f \|_{\infty} < \infty$. Show that $\lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \|f_p\| = \|f\|_{\infty}$. This is from Real and Complex by Rudin, chapter 3 exercise 14. Progress: I have shown that $\|f\|_{\infty} \le \lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \|f\|_p$ as follows, Fix $\epsilon > 0$. Let $E = \{x : |f(x)| > \|f\|_{\infty} - \epsilon \}$. Then observe
$$ \|f\|_p \ge \left( \int_{E} |f|^p d\mu \right)^{1/p} > \left( \int_{E}(\| f \|_{\infty} - \epsilon)^{p} d\mu \right)^{1/p} = \left( \|f\|_{\infty} - \epsilon \right) \mu(E)^{1/p}, $$
thus, $\lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \|f\|_p \ge \|f\|_{\infty} - \epsilon$ since $\mu(E) < \infty$. I attempted something similar for the other direction, but could not say the measure of a set was finite like (I think) I need for this argument to work. Here is what I tried: Since $\|f\|_r < \infty, \exists R$ so that $|x| > R \implies f(x) < \frac{1}{2}$. Let $A = \{ x : |x| \le R \}$ and $B = \{x : |x| > R \}$. Then,
$$\|f\|_{p} \le \left( \int_{A} |f|^p d \mu + \int_{B} \frac{1}{2^p} d\mu\right)^{1/p} = \left( \int_{A} |f|^p d\mu + \frac{1}{2^p} \mu( B ) \right)^{1/p}.$$ If $\mu(B) < \infty$ this can easily show the desired result. Moreover, if I could show that there is a family of sets $\{B_p\}$ that act similarly so that $\mu(B_p)$ grows slower than $e^p$, then I can also complete the proof.

$$ We can also easily see that $f_y$ is linear. Let $x,z\in c_0$ and $y\in\ell^1$ then $$
f_y(x+z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (x_k+z_k)y_k=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (x_ky_k+z_ky_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_ky_k+\sum_{k=1}^\infty z_ky_k=f_y(x)+f_y(z)
$$ and for $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ $$
f_y(\alpha x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha x_k=\alpha\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_k=\alpha f_y(x).
$$ Let $\varepsilon>0$ and since $y\in\ell^1$ , we know that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |y_k|$ converges. So there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n>N$ we have $$
\sum_{k=n}^\infty |y_k|<\varepsilon.
$$ Now define the following sequence $x=\{x_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ as $$
x_k=\begin{cases}
\operatorname{sgn}(y_k),&\,k\le N\\
0, & \,k>N
\end{cases}.
$$ Thus $x\in c_0$ and $$
\begin{align}
\left|f_y(x)-||y||_1\right|&=\left|\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_ky_k-\sum_{k=1}^\infty |y_k|\right|\\
&=\left|\sum_{k=1}^N\operatorname{sgn}(y_k)y_k-\sum_{k=1}^\infty |y_k|\right|=\left|\sum_{k=1}^N |y_k|-\sum_{k=1}^\infty |y_k|\right|=\left|\sum_{k=N+1}^\infty |y_k|\right|<\varepsilon.
\end{align}
$$ So we conclude that \begin{equation}
\ell^1\subseteq c_0^*.
\end{equation} Observe that the above argument also establishes that $||f_y||_*=||y||_1$ . Now let $f$ be any linear functional on $c_0$ and let $\{e_k\}$ be the sequence with a 1 in the $k$ -th position and zero elsewhere. Then for any $x\in c_0$ we have $$
|f(x)|=\left|f\left(\sum_{k=1}^\infty e_kx_k\right)\right|=\left|\sum_{k=1}^\infty f(e_k)x_k\right|\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty |f(e_k)|\,|x_k|\le||x||_\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty |f(e_k)|.
$$ Since $f$ is a bounded functional, we must have $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |f(e_k)|$ converging, otherwise $f(x)$ would be unbounded. Thus $\{f(e_k)\}_{k=1}^\infty\in c_0$ and we conclude that \begin{equation}
c_0^*\subseteq\ell^1. 
\end{equation} Thus (1) and (2) tell us that $$c_0^*=\ell^1.$$ QUESTIONS: If we take $c$ to be the collection of sequences that converge to some real number and $c^*$ to be it dual space, I know that $c^*=\ell^1$ as well, but I am not sure how to prove it. Is it enough to observe that if $x\in c$ and that $x\to x'$ then $x-x'\in c_0$ , therefore they have the same dual space? I am a little fuzzy here, obviously. Also, can someone clean up my align environment. I can't figure out how to make it compile properly.

678969,Why is the set of all $\infty$-tuples with finitely many non-zero rational terms dense in $\ell_2$?,"This statement has been given as an example in the book ""Introductory real analysis"" written by Kolmogorov and Fomin: The set of all points $x=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n,\cdots)$ with only
  finitely many non-zero coordinates, each a rational number, is dense
  in the space $\ell_2$. and $\ell_2$ is defined this way: $$\ell_2 = \{ (x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n, \cdots): \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n^2 <\infty  \text{ and } x_n \in \mathbb{R} \} $$ Analysis is one of my weak subjects in math. So, please bear with me. I know what I need to show. Suppose that I define:
$$A = \{ (x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n, \cdots): \text{only finitely many terms are non-zero and }  x_i \in \mathbb{Q} \}$$ I need to show that if $(x_n)_{n \in\mathbb{N}}$ is in $l_2$ then one can find a ""sequence of sequences in $A$"" such that the limit approaches to $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. So, if I was allowed to use sequences like $(x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n, \cdots)$ where only finitely many terms are non-zero but the terms were allowed to be in $\mathbb{R}$ I was done because for any sequence $(x_n)$ the sequence $(y_k)$ where $y_k = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k, 0, 0, 0, \cdots, 0, \cdots)$ works. Am I right? Now the problem is that I should find a sequence like $y_k$ where this time all terms must be chosen from rational numbers. This is my solution for this: Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ I can find a sequence of rational numbers that approaches any given real number $x_i$. therefore: $$x_1 = \lim (q_{11},q_{12},q_{13}, \cdots, q_{1n}, \cdots)$$
$$x_2 = \lim (q_{21},q_{22},q_{23}, \cdots, q_{2n}, \cdots)$$
$$\vdots$$
$$x_i = \lim (q_{i1},q_{i2},q_{i3}, \cdots, q_{in}, \cdots)$$
$$\vdots$$ Now I create my new sequence this way: $$y_1 = (q_{11},0,0,0,0,0,0,\cdots)$$
$$y_2 = (q_{12},q_{22},0,0,0,0,\cdots)$$
$$y_3 = (q_{13},q_{23},q_{33},0,0,\cdots)$$ and $y_k$ is formed the similar way. I mean you go the $k$-th column and choose $q_{1k},q_{2k},\cdots,q_{kk}$ on the rows and put zero for all other entries beyond the $k$-th coordinate. I want to claim that given any $x=(x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n, \cdots)$ in $\ell_2$, the sequence $(y_k)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ constructed in the way just explained approaches $x \in \ell_2$. I think it is obvious that this is true because: $$\lim_{k \to \infty} y_k = (\lim_{k \to \infty} q_{nk})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$$ Does what I'm saying makes sense?

In the following paper , the author recalls several sufficient criteria for irrationality. When applying some of this criteria to $m$ I arrive that the condition of some of the criteria are not satisfied by means of Bertrand´s Postulate. I found a similar result by Sándor: Let $\lbrace a_m\rbrace$, $m\geq 1$ be a sequence of positive integers such that $$\text{lim sup}\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_1a_2\cdots a_m}=\infty \;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;\;\;\text{lim inf}\frac{a_{m+1}}{a_m}>1$$ Then the series $\displaystyle\sum_{m} \frac{1}{a_m}$ is an irrational number. I have yet to prove that if $f$ is a continuous function then $\text{lim sup} \;f(a_m)=f(\text{lim sup}\, a_m)$. Assuming this; $$\text{lim inf}\; P_{m+1}-P_{m}>1$$
where $P_m$ is the $m$-th prime. But I have trouble with
$$\text{lim sup}\; P_{m+1}-\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{j}$$
my guess is that
$$\text{lim sup}\; P_{m+1}-\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{j}\neq\infty$$
so
$$\text{lim sup}\frac{2^{P_{m+1}}}{2^{P_1}\cdots 2^{P_m}}\neq\infty$$ and this theorem will result useless to tell if $m$ is irrational. How can I prove (or disprove) that $m$ is irrational (are there any other simpler criteria)? How can I use Dirichlet criterion  or Hurwitz criterion? What is its irrationality measure ? Any help is highly appreciated. Edit: That $m$ is irrational is clear by the criteria provided in the comments, namely that if $x$ is rational then the binary representation of $x$ is periodic. The number $m$ in binary expansion has $1$ in the $P$-th position and zero elsewhere. As there are arbitrarily large gaps between primes; then the binary representation fails to be periodic.

I'm trying to find out if the unit sphere $S=\{f \in C[0,1] : \| f \|_1 = 1\}$ is compact or not.

So this triangles have constant area $1$, and then the functions have norm $1$. This sequence of functions converges pointwise to the function zero, and not uniformly. But now I'm struggling to prove that this sequence doesn't have a convergent subsequence in the metric induced by the norm (I was trying to prove that by proving that $\{f_n\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence). Maybe there's an easier counterexample, or maybe the sphere is compact, I don't know. I hope you can give me a counterexample so I can work on it or tell me if it's compact or not in order to know what I actually have to prove. Thanks.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

679094,What exactly is meant by symmetry?,"This is something that has troubled me for long. M. Artin, in his book Algebra (pp.155-156), describes four types of symmetry (of plane figures): bilateral (i.e. reflective), rotational, translational, and glide. I somehow understand symmetry to be a ""condition"" in which a figure, under a specific set of operations, remains ""essentially the same"" or congruent. How do we prove that the figure before the operation and after the operation are the same? By superimposing the two. For example, if I take an equilateral triangle and rotate it by $60^\circ$ , the figure before rotation and after rotation will superimpose perfectly. I am not allowed to rotate the resultant figure by $-60^\circ$ to superimpose the two figures. I have to superimpose the two figures as they are. Hence, symmetry seems to be a marriage of certain figures and specific operations. If, after a certain operation has acted upon a figure, the two figures can be imposed without performing any further operation , we have symmetry. Is this correct? If it is, why is translation a ""symmetry-related"" operation then? If I have a triangle, and I translate it by vector $\overline{a}$ , I will have to translate it by $-\overline{a}$ to superimpose the two figures! In other words, I will have to perform an additional operation for super-imposition! Same is the case for glide. Sorry for the ambiguous wording. I have tried to elucidate my doubts to the best of my abilities. Thanks","['symmetry', 'group-theory']"
