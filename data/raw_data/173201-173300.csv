3082693,"A function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ that is open and closed, but not continuous.","Does there exist a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ that is open and closed, but not continuous? Note that I require $f$ to be defined on the entirety of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . There are a few examples of open functions that are not continuous. Most examples I found were functions $f$ with the property that $f(U)=\mathbb{R}^2$ for all open $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ . The extra requirement that $f$ needs to be closed makes things a lot harder, though. I believe the answer is no, such a function does not exist. My main motivation is the following observation. Proposition: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ be open and closed. If $x_n\to x$ and $f(x_n)$ is bounded, then $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ . Proof of 1: Let $f(x_{n_i})$ be a convergent subsequence of $f(x_n)$ with limit $p$ . For all $i$ let $y_i=x_{n_i}$ if $f(x_{n_i})\neq p$ . Otherwise, let $r=d(x_{n_i},x)$ . Then $B_r(x_{n_i})$ is open, so $f(B_r(x_{n_i}))$ is open as well. So $f(B_r(x_{n_i}))\cap B_r(p)\setminus\{p\}$ is not empty. So we can choose $y_i\in B_r(x_{n_i})$ such that $f(y_i)\in B_r(p)\setminus\{p\}$ . We find $y_i\to x$ and $f(y_i)\to p$ and $f(y_i)\neq p$ for all $i$ . Let $S=\{y_i:i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ . We find that $p$ is a limit point of $f(S)$ not contained in $f(S)$ . However, $C=S\cup\{x\}$ is closed, so $f(C)$ is also closed, and hence contains $p$ . We conclude $f(x)=p$ , so $f(x_{n_i})\to f(x)$ . Assume for the contrary that $f(x_n)\not\to f(x)$ . Then there is a subsequence of $f(x_n)$ that always stays a certain distance from $f(x)$ . By the Bolzano Weierstrass theorem, this subsequence itself has a convergent subsequence. By the previous observation, this subsequence converges to $f(x)$ . This contradicts the fact that it always stays a certain distance from $f(x)$ . $\square$ If you manage to prove that such a function does not exist, it might be neat to also look at how general the domain and codomain of $f$ can be made. For example, all arguments in the proposition still work for $f:X\to Y$ with any metric space $X$ , and any finite dimensional vector space $Y$ . However, with tweaking the arguments only a bit you find the following. Let $X$ be a first countable Hausdorff topological space, and let $Y$ be a first countable topological space with no isolated points. Let $f:X\to Y$ be open and closed. If $x_n\to x$ and $f(x_n)$ is contained in some sequentially compact set, then $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ . Anyways, please let me know your thoughts.","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

3082746,Property of smooth functions on the adeles,"Let $k$ be a number field, $\mathbb A$ the ring of adeles of $k$ , $\mathbb A_f$ the finite adeles, and $\mathbb A_{\infty}$ the infinite adeles. Let $\phi: \mathbb A = \mathbb A_{\infty} \times \mathbb A_f \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be a continuous function which is smooth in the first variable and locally constant in the second variable.  Some authors call such a function smooth . Is it the case that for every $x \in \mathbb A$ , there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ , and an open compact subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb A_f$ , such that $$\phi(x'+h) = \phi(x')$$ for all $x' \in U, h \in H$ ? This seems to be the claim in an answer to one of my questions on Mathoverflow, which I am trying to understand. My attempt: Lemma 1 : For every $x \in \mathbb A$ , there exists an open compact subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb A_f$ such that $\phi(x+h) = \phi(x)$ for all $h \in H$ . The problem becomes whether in the Lemma we can choose $H$ uniformly for $x'$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of $x$ . Proof of Lemma 1: Let $x = (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb A = \mathbb A_{\infty} \times \mathbb A_f$ .  There exists an open neighborhood $V \subset \mathbb A_f$ of $x_2$ such that $$\phi(x_1,y') = \phi(x_1,x_2)$$ for all $y' \in V$ .  Let $H$ be an open compact subgroup of $\mathbb A_f$ which is contained in the neighborhood $V - x_2$ of the identity.  Then for all $h \in H$ , we have $h + x_2 \in V$ , and so $$\phi(x + h) = \phi((x_1,x_2) + (0,h)) = \phi(x_1,x_2+h) = \phi(x_1,x_2) = \phi(x)$$ $\blacksquare$ To prove what I want, I will definitely need to make use of the fact that $\phi$ is continuous.  So far I haven't been successful.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'adeles', 'topological-groups']"

3082851,"Showing that $\cos^p{\Theta} \le \cos{p\Theta}$, for $0<\Theta<\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $0<p<1$, by analyzing $f(\theta)=\frac{\cos^p\Theta}{\cos p\Theta}$","Given $0 < \Theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $0 < p < 1$ , show that $$\cos^p{\Theta} \le \cos{p\Theta}$$ Can you please check if my proof is correct? Would also love to know if there're other ways of proving this. Proof. Let $$f(\Theta) = \frac{\cos^p{\Theta}}{\cos{p\Theta}}$$ considering $p$ fixed. The derivative is $$f'(\Theta) = \frac{p*\cos^{p-1}{\Theta}*{(-\sin{\Theta})*\cos{p\Theta} -\cos^p{\Theta}*(-\sin{p\Theta}*p) } } {\cos^2{p\Theta}} = \frac{p*\cos^{p-1}{\Theta}*\sin{(p-1)\Theta}}{\cos^2{p\Theta}}$$ We have $f(0)=1$ , and because $0<p<1$ , the term $\sin(p-1)\Theta$ makes the derivative negative: $f'(\Theta) < 0$ on $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ . At $0$ we have $f'(0)=0$ , so we cannot immediately deduce that $f$ is decreasing on all of $[0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ . However, considering that $f(0)=1, f(\frac{\pi}{2})=0$ , and both $f$ and $f'$ are continuous on $[0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ , if it were the case that $f$ rises above $1$ at some $\Theta \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ , $f$ would have to have a local maximum somewhere in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ , with the derivative vanishing at that point, which cannot happen. Therefore $f(\Theta) \le 1$ throughout $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ , Q.E.D.","['calculus', 'proof-verification', 'trigonometry']"

Specifically, for $k=3,4$ , it involves Catalan's constant $G$ and the ""similar"" Gieseking's constant $H$ , $$G = \text{Cl}_2\big(\tfrac{\pi}2\big)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac1{(4n+1)^2}-\frac1{(4n+3)^2}\right)=0.91596\dots$$ $$H = \text{Cl}_2\big(\tfrac{\pi}3\big)=\frac{3\sqrt3}4\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac1{(3n+1)^2}-\frac1{(3n+2)^2}\right)=1.01494\dots$$ with Clausen's integral $\text{Cl}_2(\theta)$ .

Is this result also true/False in other categories like Groups, Topological spaces? In the case of smooth manifolds, I think this is true by using rank theorem since by rank theorem the map in local coordinates is of the form $(x^1,x^2,...,x^n)\to (x^1,x^2,...,x^n)$ and we can think of $U$ as embedded in $U \times W$ as $U\times \{y\}$ for some $y\in W$ fixed. and similarly, think of $V$ as embedded in $V \times W$ as $V\times \{y\}$ .

3083318,Completion of local frames for the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold,"In John M. Lee book Introductions to smooth manifolds Proposition 8.11 is left as exercise. Can anyone give me hints and suggestions to prove it? In particular, i want to show: Let $M$ be a smooth $n$ -manifold with or without boundary and let $(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ be a linearly independent $k$ -tuple of smooth vector fields on an open subset $U$ of $M$ , with $1\le k< n$ . Then for each $p\in U$ there exist smooth vector fields $X_{k+1},\dots,X_n$ in a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ is a smooth local frame for $M$ on $U \cap V$ . I can easily see that since $X_1|_p,\dots,X_k|_p$ are vectors linearly independent in $T_pM$ then there exist $v_{k+1},\dots,v_n$ in $T_pM$ such that $\{X_1|_p,\dots,X_k|_p,v_{k+1},\dots,v_n\}$ is a basis for $T_pM$ . I also know that I can extend each $v_i$ to a smooth global vector field on $M$ , say $X_i$ (with $i>k$ ). But then, with this argument, it may be that $(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ is not a local frame for $M$ on $U$ . I can only say that $(X_1|_p,\dots,X_n|_p)$ is a basis for $T_pM$ .

Let be $(W,(x^i))$ a smooth chart for $M$ in $p$ , then we have $X_i|_q=X_i^j(q)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}|_q$ for each $q$ in $U \cap W$ and each $i\le k$ , and we have $v_i=v_i^j\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}|_p\in T_pM$ for each $k<i\le n$ . Now I define $X_{k+i}|_q=v_i^j\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}|_q$ for each $q\in W$ , and these are smooth vector fields on $W$ . Now the map $G:U \cap W\to M(n\times n, \mathbb{R}), \quad q\mapsto (X_i^j(q))$ is smooth and $G^{-1}(GL(n,\mathbb{R}))$ is the neighborhood of $p$ on which $(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ is a smooth local frame, right?","['vector-fields', 'smooth-functions', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

3083396,"Formal construction of the Cantor set $K$ and determination of $[0,1]\setminus K.$","Let $J_{0,1}:=[0,1]$ . Step 1. We remove the central open interval $I_{0,1}=\big(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\big)$ . We denote with $J_{1,1}:=\big[0,\frac{1}{3}\big]$ and with $J_{1,2}:=\big[\frac{2}{3},1\big]$ . We define $K_1:=J_{1,1}\cup J_{1,2}$ then $\complement{K_1}=I_{0,1}.$ Step 2. We remove from $J_{1,1}$ and $J_{1,2}$ the central open interval of length $\frac{1}{9}$ . Then we define what remains with $K_2:=J_{2,1}\cup J_{2,2}\cup J_{2,3}\cup J_{2,4}$ , where $J_{2,1}=\big[0,\frac{1}{9}\big]$ , $J_{2,2}=\big[\frac{2}{9},\frac{1}{3}\big]$ , $J_{2,3}=\big[\frac{2}{3},\frac{7}{9}\big]$ , $J_{2,4}=\big[\frac{8}{9}, 1\big]$ .
At this point we define with $I_{1,1}=\big(\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\big)$ , $I_{1,2}=\big(\frac{7}{9},\frac{8}{9}\big)$ the two open interval just removed. Therefore, $\complement{K_2}=\complement{K_1}\cup \big(I_{1,1}\cup I_{1,2}\big)$ At the end of step $n$ we will have $2^n$ close interval $J_{n,k}$ for $k=1,\cdots, 2^n$ of length $1/3^n.$ For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we define $$K_{n}:=\bigcup_{k=1}^{2^n} J_{n,k}$$ We define the Cantor set $K$ in the follow way $$K:=\bigcap_{n=1}^{+\infty} K_n.$$ In general, as discussed above, $$\complement{K_n}= \complement{K_{n-1}}\cup\bigcup_{k=1}^{2^n/2} I_{n-1,k}\tag1$$ Question 1. It's correct (1)? We determine, $$[0,1]\setminus K=[0,1]\cap \bigg[\bigcup_{n=1}^{+\infty}\complement{K_{n-1}}\cup \bigcup_{n=1}^{+\infty}\bigcup_{k=1}^{2^n/2} I_{n-1,k}\bigg]\tag2$$ Question 2.

3083408,Continuity of homotopy in proof of Hopf's Umlaufsatz,"The standard proof of Hopf's Umlaufsatz proceeds something like
this: We have a unit speed $\mathcal{C}^1$ curve $\beta:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$ .  Furthermore, $\beta$ is a simple loop with period $L$ .
We now define $T=\{(t_1,t_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : 0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2 \leq L \}$ and a function $f$ on $T$ as follows: $$ f(t_1,t_2) =
  \begin{cases}
    \beta'(t_1) & t_1=t_2 \\
    -\beta'(0) & (t_1,t_2)=(0,L) \\
    \frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{\|\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)\|} & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} $$ It is visually obvious that $f$ is continuous, but I haven't found a strict proof of this anywhere.
Below is my attempt at a proof, but I think it's ugly and long-winded and it
also isn't complete.  My question is how to finish it.  I also suspect (or
rather hope) that there is a significantly shorter (or more elegant) proof
that is nevertheless complete and doesn't use hand-waving. First of all, $f$ is continuous for all $(t_1,t_2)\in T$ with $t_1\neq t_2$ and $(t_1,t_2)\neq(0,L)$ because (as $\beta$ is simple) the denominator of $(\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1))/(\|\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)\|)$ doesn't
vanish and $\beta$ and the norm are continuous. Now for the case $t_1=t_2$ .  Fix $t_1\in[0,L]$ .  We have $$ \lim_{t_2\to t_1} \frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{t_2-t_1} = \beta'(t_1) $$ by definition.  This implies $$ \lim_{\substack{t_2\to t_1\\t_2>t_1}} \frac{\|\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)\|}{t_2-t_1} = \lim_{\substack{t_2\to t_1}} \left\|\frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}\right\| = \|\beta'(t_1)\| = 1 $$ as $\beta$ is a unit speed curve.
Combining these two we get $$ \lim_{\substack{t_2\to t_1\\t_2>t_1}} f(t_1,t_2) = \lim_{t_2\to t_1} \frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{t_2-t_1} \cdot 
\lim_{\substack{t_2\to t_1\\t_2>t_1}} \frac{t_2-t_1}{\|\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)\|} = \beta'(t_1) $$ This means that for every $\varepsilon>0$ we can find a $\delta>0$ such that
for all $t_2$ with $|t_2-t_1|<\delta$ and $(t_1,t_2)\in T$ we have $\|f(t_1,t_2)-\beta'(t_1)\|<\varepsilon$ . As $[0,L]$ is compact, we can even, for a given $\varepsilon>0$ , find a $\delta_1>0$ such that for all $(t_1,t_2)\in T$ with $|t_2-t_1|<\delta_1$ the inequality $\|f(t_1,t_2)-\beta'(t_1)\|<\varepsilon/2$ holds. Also, as $\beta'$ is continuous and $[0,L]$ is compact, we can find a $\delta_2>0$ such that for all $t_1^\ast,t_1\in[0,L]$ with $|t_1-t_1^\ast|<\delta_2$ we
have $\|\beta'(t_1) - \beta'(t_1^\ast)\|<\varepsilon/2$ . Now let $P=(t_1,t_2)\in T$ be arbitrary with $\|P-(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)\|<\min\{\delta_1/2,\delta_2\}$ .  That implies $|t_1-t_1^\ast|<\delta_2$ and $|t_2-t_1|<\delta_1$ .  By combining the
previous two inequalities we get $\|f(P)-\beta'(t_1^\ast)\|<\varepsilon$ .  We have thus proved that $f$ is continuous in $(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)$ . The third case is the point $Q=(0,L)$ .  As $\beta$ is a loop, we have: $$ \lim_{t\to L} \frac{\beta(t)-\beta(0)}{L-t} = -\lim_{t\to L} \frac{\beta(L)-\beta(t)}{L-t} = -\beta'(L) = -\beta'(0) $$ And as a consequence we have: $$ \lim_{\substack{t\to L\\t<L}} \frac{\|\beta(t)-\beta(0)\|}{L-t} = \lim_{\substack{t\to L}} \left\|\frac{\beta(t)-\beta(0)}{L-t}\right\| = \|-\beta'(0)\| = 1 $$ Combining these two we get, as above: $$ \lim_{\substack{t\to L\\t<L}} f(0,t) =  -\beta'(0) $$ At this point I'm stuck.  I think that we need to show that $f$ is uniformly
continuous around $Q$ and that maybe this is the case because $\beta$ has
unit speed.  If we can prove that, we can approach $Q$ in a way similar to the
second case: starting from a point near enough we first move - by virtue of
uniform continuity - parallel to the $x$ axis until the first component is
zero.  Then we move vertically towards $Q$ . EDIT: Using Ted Shifrin's advice, I've rewritten the second case of the proof.
However, it seems to me that this depends on the Taylor remainder $R$ being
continuous in both variables (see question mark below) which - if justified in
detail - is not much different from what I did above and still doesn't solve
the third case.  Or am I missing something? As $\beta$ is differentiable, we can write, for each $t_1\in[0,L]$ , $$ \beta(t_2)=\beta(t_1)+(t_2-t_1)\cdot\beta'(t_1) +(t_2-t_1)\cdot R(t_1,t_2-t_1) $$ with $\lim_{t\to0}R(t_1,t)=\mathbf0$ . We thus have $$ \lim_{(t_1,t_2)\to(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)} \frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{t_2-t_1} = \lim_{(t_1,t_2)\to(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)} (\beta'(t_1) + R(t_1,t_2-t_1)) \stackrel{\color{red}?}{=} \beta'(t_1^\ast) $$ and $$ \lim_{\substack{(t_1,t_2)\to(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)\\t_2>t_1}} \frac{\|\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)\|}{t_2-t_1} = \lim_{\substack{(t_1,t_2)\to(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)\\t_2>t_1}} \left\|\frac{\beta(t_2)-\beta(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}\right\| = \|\beta'(t_1^\ast)\|=1 $$ which eventually leads to $$ \lim_{\substack{(t_1,t_2)\to(t_1^\ast,t_1^\ast)\\t_2>t_1}} f(t_1,t_2) = \beta'(t_1^\ast)  $$ as above.","['continuity', 'differential-geometry', 'real-analysis']"

I have tried to work the first sum out, but I really am not sure how to continue with these floor functions, nor am I sure how to truly approach these sums. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you all for taking the time to read my post.","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3083792,All sequences are sets?,"I have learned that: A sequence is a function from a subset of natural numbers to some set A A function is a relation with certain properties A relation is a subset of a Cartesian product It seems, therefore, that I could represent any sequence as a set like $\left\{\left(n_1,a_1\right),\left(n_2,a_2\right),\dots\right\}$ , where the $n_i$ form the subset of natural numbers and $a_i$ are what we would normally refer to as the elements of the sequence. Is that correct? If so, it would help me think carefully about things like Cartesian products of sequences, functions from sequences to a set, etc., because I could think about things in terms of sets. The Wikipedia article on sequences compares and contrasts them with sets, and I couldn't find a source that viewed a sequence as a kind of set, so I'm wondering whether my interpretation is wrong or just uncommon (or neither).

3083912,Compute area of a sphere through a Dirac delta,"I've been having issues with integrating with a Dirac delta. To compute the area of a sphere centered at $(0,0,0)$ it seems to work just fine: $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}{\int_{0}^{\pi}{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\delta(r-\rho)r^2\sin\theta\, dr}\,d\theta}\,d\phi} = 4\pi\rho^2$$ Now I will take the same sphere but offset by $(0,0,\rho)$ , that is: $x^2 + y^2 + (z-\rho)^2 = \rho^2$ . Going to spherical coordinates yields: $r^2\cos^2\phi\sin^2\theta + r^2\sin^2\phi\sin^2\theta + (r\cos\theta-\rho)^2 = \rho^2$ , which yields: $r(r-2\rho\cos\theta)=0$ , and we can express the sphere in spherical coordinates as: $r(\theta) = 2\rho\cos\theta, \theta \in [0,\pi/2], \phi\in[0,2\pi]$ .
Integrating yields: $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}{\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\delta(r-2\rho\cos\theta)r^2\sin\theta\, dr}\,d\theta}\,d\phi} = \frac{8\pi\rho^2}{3}$$ Now this is not right clearly. The only reason I can think of has to do something with properties of the Dirac  delta I am unaware of. Note that I have not studied measure theory. I need the Dirac delta and not a surface integral  because I will be using this to compute transformations of probability density functions which I will need to write through a Dirac delta. Edit: References covering this for engineers/computer science students are welcome. Edit 2:
Taking into account David Holden's answer I came up with the following fact which must hold (I hope it's correct): $$\int_{V}{\delta(f(x)) \,dx} = \int_{S = \{x|f(x) =0\}}{\,dA}$$ Edit 3:
I found some more information on the subject: Impulse functions over curves and surfaces Properties_in_n_dimensions Surface area from indicator function Property of Dirac delta function in $\mathbb{R}^n$ Does the coarea formula hold for delta-function? I believe the issue was that whenever I offset the sphere the Dirac delta changed such that $\delta(f(r)) \rightarrow \delta(g(r,\theta))$ and $g$ was then a non-trivial mapping (so it's not the one-dimensional dirac delta I am used to anymore). Based on the first article I believe that I can rewrite it as a surface Dirac delta $\delta(g(r,\theta)) = \delta_S(r,\theta)$ which yields the surface integral giving a correct result. The other threads and wikipedia state that I should have a normalization by the magnitude of the gradient. I think I am missing an important piece since for the result to be correct this normalization factor should cancel out with something. More precisely: $$\int_V{\delta(r-2\rho\cos\theta)r^2\sin\theta \,dr\,d\theta\,d\phi} = \int_S{\frac{\,d\sigma}{\sqrt{r^2+\rho^2-2r\rho\cos\theta}}}$$ The only idea I have is that somehow the normalization factor will pop out of the $\,d\sigma$ . No idea though since it's supposed to be a 'Minkowski content measure' which is way over my head as a computer science student. To add to this I would also like to be able to solve the same problem with a heaviside function (for integrating the volume of the offset ball). I am unsure whether similar considerations apply there, however if I integrate it, the result seems correct. I still want to make sure this is valid for other volumes also (maybe it's just a coincidence like the sphere centered at $(0,0,0)$ ). So I would be grateful if somebody with more knowledge on geometric measure theory could clarify all of the points.","['multivariable-calculus', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'probability']"
3083918,"Reference for ""continuity in mean"" of integrable functions","In the measury theory class I'm taking we proved the following theorem Let $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R^n})$ .

3083923,Importance of Vanishing Cohomology,"As part of my masters project I have been working through Serre's FAC . Below are three closely related results I will be presenting as part of my defense. These results are from n $^{°}$ 52, page 63 from the English translation here . The results are as follows: Let $X = \mathbb{P}_r(K)$ and let $\mathscr{F}$ be a coherent algebraic sheaf on $X$ . Then $H^{n}(X, \mathscr{F}) = 0$ for $n > r$ . Result 1. can be generalized as follows: Let $V$ be an algebraic variety isomorphic to a locally closed subvariety of the projective space $X$ . Let $\mathscr{F}$ be an algebraic coherent sheaf on $V$ and let $W$ be the subvariety of $V$ such that such that $\mathscr{F}$ is zero outside $W$ . We then have $H^n(V,\mathscr{F}) = 0$ for $n > \mathrm{dim} \, W$ . In particular taking $W = V$ in result 2. we see that $H^n(V, \mathscr{F}) = 0$ , for $n > \mathrm{dim} V$ . These results are, more or less, supposed to be a big culmination of my project. I have worked through the material in FAC pretty rigorously up to this point, but I am not enough of an expert yet to see the connections and implications to geometry. Also, my intuition is still fairly poor. I have to write out everything and work through it slowly. What I have learned from this paper so far is a lot of elementary general sheaf theory (I say elementary, but it was by no means easy for me), a lot of general Cech cohomology, and now I am in the chapters where he ties it into the geometry (chapters II and III on varieties and protective varieties respectively). In the interest of time I have skipped some sections, but not too many. I am sure if I keep going and finish the paper, and keep studying AG for years to come, the importance of such results will be obvious to me. But, I don't have that much time before I defend my masters project and I will almost surely be asked to explain the importance of these results. Right now, the best answer I would have is that I do not know why, but I trust that they are important. Ha! Some reasons I trust that they are important are 1) Serre chose to label it as a proposition / corollary which means he thinks it is important. 2) Results like this seem to be ubiquitous, Serre gives versions and analogues of this result in the chapter on varieties and the chapter on projective varieties. In the introduction to this paper he mentions it is one of the main results in the non-projective varieties chapter. There are also analogue assertions like this made in other big results like the Weil conjectures (not exactly the same, but the same flavor). Can anyone offer me some insight as to why these vanishing cohomology results are relevant? Why are they important for geometry? Why are they important from an abstract homological algebra view? Why are they natural questions to try to answer? In response to the obvious question ""why would you set out to study this if you don't know why it is important?"" - Because my adviser recommended it and I trust him. In response to ""well then why don't you ask your adviser why it is important?"" - I already did. Now I am asking you, too.","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-cohomology', 'coherent-sheaves', 'sheaf-theory']"

3084033,Why is the set $\{x \mid f(x) \not= g(x)\}$ measurable in a topological hausdorff space?,"assuming i have a measure space $(X, \mathscr{M}_X, \mu)$ and a measurable space $(Y,\mathscr{M}_Y)$ , two measurable mappings $f,g:X \to Y$ and it holds that $Y$ is a topological hausdorff space with a countable base. (I think i am supposed to assume that $\mathscr{M}_Y$ is the Borel- $\sigma$ -Algebra generated by the open/closed subsets of Y) Now i am wonderung: Why exactly is the set $\{x \in X \mid f(x) \not= g(x)\}$ measurable? in other words why is $$\{x \in X \mid f(x) \not= g(x)\} \in \mathscr{M}_X$$ I know that the diagonal $\Delta Y = \{(y,y)\mid y \in Y\}\subset Y \times Y$ is closed in any hausdorff space. I also know that since $\Delta Y$ is closed in $Y \times Y$ , its complement $(Y \times Y)\setminus \Delta Y$ is open. However, $\{(f(x),g(x)\mid x \in X,  f(x) \not= g(x) \}$ is only a subset of $(Y \times Y)\setminus \Delta Y$ for which i can't say whether it is open or closed. The only idea that's left was to try this: Pick an arbitrary point $p = (f(x),g(x))$ for which $f(x)\not= g(x)$ in $Y\times Y$ . Since $Y$ is a Hausdorff space, we can find disjoint open neighbourhoods $U$ around $f(x)$ and $V$ around $g(x)$ such that $U \times V$ is an open neighbourhood of $(f(x),g(x))$ with $$U \times V \cap \Delta Y = \emptyset$$ Since $\{(f(x),g(x)\mid x \in X, f(x) \not= g(x) \}$ is a union of all such open neighbourhoods $U\times V$ of points $(f(x),g(x))$ with $f(x) \not= g(x)$ it is open in $Y\times Y$ . (is this correct?) If the last paragraph would be correct, i'd be finished. Thank you very much for any of your help. EDIT: New summary of what i gathered so far with the help of the recent comments and answers: As pointed out in the comments, i did the mistake to purely focus on $$B:= \{(f(x),g(x)\mid f(x) \not= g(x), x \in X\}$$ and tried to conclude that its preimage is measurable iff $B$ is open which was a wrong assumption in the first place. Therefore, i do not need $B$ itself to be open. It's sufficient to show that the union of all open disjoint neighbourhoods $U\times V$ of arbitrary points $f(x),g(x)$ for which $f(x) \not= g(x)$ is an open set ; because what matters is its preimage and not the set (image) itself. Let $$ B' := \bigcup\{U \times V \mid U, V \in \mathcal{B}\ ;\ U \cap V = \emptyset\}$$ $B'$ is obviously an open set, therefore its preimage is mesaurable. For the preimage of open disjoint neighbourhoods $U,V$ of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectively, it holds that $$(f\times g)^{-1}(U\times V) = \{x \mid f(x)\in U \wedge g(x) \in V\} = f^{-1}(U)\cap g^{-1}(V)$$ (this is something i actually didnt know, it didn't know the definition of cartesian products of mappings, that's also the reason i didnt understand alex's question right away) Since $U\times V$ is open, $(f\times g)^{-1}(U \times V)$ is measurable. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable base the set $$\{x \in X\mid f(x) \not= g(x) \} = \bigcup \{ (f\times g)^{-1}(U\times V) \mid U, V \in \mathcal{B}, U \cap V = \emptyset\} = \bigcup\{ f^{-1}(U)\cap g^{-1}(V)\mid U, V \in \mathcal{B}, U \cap V = \emptyset\}$$ is a countable union of measurable sets and therefore measurable itself.","['measurable-sets', 'general-topology', 'measurable-functions', 'measure-theory']"

Let $C$ be a category and $A$ an object of $C$ , then the slice category $C_{A}$ has as objects all morphisms $f\colon Z \to A $ where $Z$ is an object of $C$ . For two objects of $C_A$ , $f_1 \colon Z_1 \to A$ and $f_2 \colon Z_2 \to A$ ,  the elements of $Hom_{C_A}(f_1,f_2)$ are given by the elements of $\sigma \in Hom_{C}(Z_1,Z_2)$ that satisfy $f_1=f_2 \circ \sigma$ . The definition of a category entails that $Hom_{C_A}(f,g)$ and $Hom_{C_A}(f',g')$ have to be disjoint unless $(f,g)=(f',g')$ . Now let $Z$ be an object in $C$ and let $f_1,f_2 \in Hom_{C}(Z,A)$ such that $f_1 \neq f_2$ Then the identity morphism $id_Z \in Hom_C(Z,Z)$ satisfies $f_1=f_1\circ id_Z$ and $f_2=f_2\circ id_Z$ . Hence $id_Z \in Hom_{C_A}(f_1,f_1)$ and $id_Z \in Hom_{C_A}(f_2,f_2)$ , implying that $C_A$ is not a category. What am i getting wrong here? I've had this problem since i read the definition of  a slice category in Aluffi's book, which i find a bit unclear. At first i thought that maybe the morphisms contain the information of their source and target and that instead of elements in $Hom_C(f_1,f_2)$ they would be something like tuples of the form $(f_1,f_2,\sigma)$ where $\sigma \in Hom_C(f_1,f_2)$ .

In particular, $\kappa_t$ is a Markov kernel on $(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R))$ for all $t\ge0$ . Let $\mathcal F^X$ denot the filtration generated by $X$ . It can be shown that $$\operatorname E\left[f(X_{s+t})\mid\mathcal F^X_s\right]=\left.\operatorname E\left[f(X^x_t)\right]\right|_{x\:=\:X_s}\;\;\;\text{almost surely}\tag4$$ for all bounded Borel measurable $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ and $s,t\ge0$ . So, $X$ is a time-homogeneous Markov process with transition semigroup $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ . Let $$\kappa_tf:=\int\kappa_t(\;\cdot\;,{\rm d}y)f(y)$$ for bounded Borel measurable $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ .

By time-homogeneity, it should suffice to consider the continuity at $t=0$ . Usually, this is shown for $\mathcal C=C_0(\mathbb R)$ in the following way: By the Itō formula, $$(\kappa_tf)(x)=\operatorname E\left[f(X^x_t)\right]=f(x)+\operatorname E\left[\int_0^t(Lf)(X_s)\:{\rm d}s\right]\;\;\;\text{for all }(t,x)\in[0,\infty)\times\mathbb R\tag6$$ and hence $$\left\|\kappa_tf-f\right\|_\infty\le\left(\sup_K|bf'|+\frac12\sup_K\sigma^2|f''|\right)t\xrightarrow{t\to0+}0\tag7$$ with $K:=\operatorname{supp}f$ for all $f\in C_c^2(\mathbb R)$ . Now, $C_c^2(\mathbb R)$ is dense in $C_0(\mathbb R)$ and hence we obtain $\left\|\kappa_tf-f\right\|_\infty\xrightarrow{t\to0+}0$ for all $f\in C_0(\mathbb R)$ . We have shown that $(5)$ is even uniformly continuous at $t=0$ for all $f\in C_0(\mathbb R)$ . On the other hand, there is the general claim (cf. my other question ) that if $X$ is a general right-continuous time-homogeneous Markov process with transition semigroup $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ , $(1)$ is continuous for all $x\in\mathbb R$ and bounded continuous $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ . So, the question is: What's the point of proving the continuity for our special $X$ only for $\mathcal C=C_0(\mathbb R)$ ?

My question is: If we know that $Y$ is contained in the dual space of some Banach separable space $Z$ , then if $M$ is a bounded subset of $Y$ , is there still a weak-* convergent subsequence in $Y$ ? The reason I ask is: Let $\Gamma$ be a 2-dimensional compact manifold. I know that the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L^1(0,T,C_c(\Gamma))$ is Banach and separable. It is also known that the dual space of $C_c(\Gamma)$ is the space of Radon measures on $\Gamma$ with finite mass, denoted by $\mathcal M(\Gamma)$ . However since $\mathcal M(\Gamma)$ is not separable we can not claim that the dual space of $L^1(0,T, C_c(\Gamma))$ is $L^{\infty}(0,T,\mathcal M(\Gamma))$ . But we do know that $L^1(0,T, C_c(\Gamma))^*$ contains always $L^{\infty}(0,T,\mathcal M(\Gamma))$ . I have a sequence of functions bounded in $L^{\infty}(0,T,L^1(\Gamma))$ . So I wonder if $Y=L^{\infty}(0,T,\mathcal M(\Gamma))$ , $Z=L^1(0,T, C_c(\Gamma))$ and $M=L^{\infty}(0,T,L^1(\Gamma))$ , can I deduce a weak-* convergent subsequence then? It seems true to me but after a lot hours of studying, I would like if somebody else could verify this. Moreover, if this is not valid, then what can we say in this case?

To do so we can for example write $z = x+iy$ and use the brute force approach. Also, it's worth mentioning that it's intuitive for me that $$\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \left| z - z_0 \right| = c \}$$ represents a circle. But I don't see at all why intuitively $C$ is a circle. So is it possible to understand geometrically why $C$ is a circle in the complex plane ? Thank you very much !","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'complex-numbers']"
3084765,All interval sequences mod integers,"In music, an all-interval twelve-tone sequence is a sequence that contains a row of 12 distinct notes such that it contains one instance of each interval within the octave, 1 through 11. The more mathematical and general definition is as follows: Definition : A sequence $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ is said to be an all-interval sequence mod $n$ if $x_i \not \equiv x_j \pmod n$ for all $1\leq i<j \leq n$ and $x_{j+1}-x_j \not \equiv x_{i+1}-x_i \pmod n$ for all $1\leq i<j \leq n-1$ . For example, the sequence $0,5,1,4,2,3$ is an all-interval sequence mod 6. There are exactly 2 such sequences mod 4, 4 such sequences mod 6, 24 of them mod 8, 288 of them mod 10, and they are given by the sequence A141599 . I could not find much about this subject online. I have found a reference Latin Squares ... which connects this definition to Latin squares of certain type. It can be easily shown that if $n$ is odd, there are no all-interval sequences mod $n$ . For $n$ even, using a computer one can compute the number of all-interval sequences mod $n$ for small values of $n$ but one quickly reaches the computing power of a regular computer around $n=20$ . I would like to explore this topic and would appreciate any references you can share. I am in particular interested in reasonable lower bounds on the number of all-interval sequences mod $n$ . Currently I can show that there are at least $\phi(n)$ all-interval sequences mod $n$ but this is a miserable lower bound compared to the actual values.","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'modular-arithmetic', 'reference-request']"
3084789,"Birthday problem, want about using unordered counting?","Given there are 365 days in a year and $n$ people, the probability that at least two people have the same birthday is given by $$\frac{365^n - 365 \cdot 364 \cdots (365-n+1)}{365^n}.$$ In this calculation, we treat the $n$ birthdays we selected as a sequence where their order matters. If we think the $n$ dates that randomly selected as a set where the order does not matter, I believe we would have the probability $$\frac{{365+n-1 \choose n} - {365\choose n}}{{365+n-1 \choose n}}.$$ For the total number of outcomes, we model by throwing $n$ balls uniformly randomly into $365$ boxes. Essentially, there are $n$ balls and $365-1$ walls (between the boxes). For example $$ \circ |\;\;\; |\;\;\;|\circ \circ |\;\;\;|\circ |\cdots |$$ would mean one person was born on day $1$ , two people were born on day $4$ , one person was born on day $6$ , and so on.
This is how I came up with the ${365+n-1\choose n}$ . For the case that everyone has a distinct birthday, it would be ${365 \choose n}$ . What is wrong with this approach?","['combinatorics', 'probability']"

3084842,Cannot find angle for trigonometry problem,"A right angle triangle is entrapped within a circle. The triangle entraps within it a circle of its own. The ratio between the big radius and the little radius is $\frac{13}{4}$ . What are the angles of the triangle? Here is the problem as I understand it, given that: 1. $\measuredangle ABC = 90^\circ \rightarrow AC = 2R$ 2. The smaller radii are perpendicular  to the triangle. 3. The origin of the smaller circle is the intersection between the angle bisectors of triangle ABC. Let $\measuredangle ACB = 2\alpha \rightarrow \measuredangle ACG  = \alpha$ $\measuredangle BAC = 90 - 2\alpha \rightarrow \measuredangle GAC = 45 - \alpha$ From here we can construct the following system: $$\begin{cases} 2R = \frac{r}{\tan \alpha} + \frac{r}{\tan(45 - \alpha)} \\ \frac{R}{r} = \frac{13}{4} \rightarrow R = \frac{13r}{4} \end{cases}$$ $$\downarrow \\ \frac{26r}{4} = r\left(\frac{1}{\tan \alpha} + \frac{1}{\tan(45 - \alpha)}\right) \quad / \div r \\ 6.5 = \frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} + \frac{\cos(45 - \alpha)}{\sin(45 - \alpha)}  \quad / {\sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sin\alpha\cos\beta \pm \sin\beta\cos\alpha\\ \cos(\alpha \pm \beta) = \cos\alpha\cos\beta \mp \sin\alpha\sin\beta} \\ 6.5 = \frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} + \frac{\cos \alpha \cos 45 + \sin \alpha \sin 45}{\sin 45 \ cos \alpha - \sin \alpha \cos 45} \\ 6.5 = \frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha } + \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \cdot \frac{\cos \alpha + \sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha - \sin \alpha} \\ 6.5 = \frac{\cos^2 \alpha - \sin\alpha \cos \alpha + \cos \alpha \sin \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha}{\sin(\cos\alpha - \sin \alpha)} \quad / \sin^2\alpha + \cos ^2 \alpha = 1\\ 6.5 = \frac{1}{\sin\alpha (\cos\alpha - \sin \alpha)}$$ From this point on, I have no identity that I can think of which can be applied here to help me solve for $\alpha$ . Amusingly enough, I got an answer which was very close to the correct one, but that was only because I made a mistake in the signs of the identity, and the second fracture turned into 1. I am aware that they may be an identity which can solve this, but I am restricted to only use the identities available here . I have either made a mistake somewhere, or just don't know how to use the available identities to solve the problem.","['trigonometry', 'geometry']"

3084895,How or why are implicit functions actually functions?,"I'm a high schooler and today my teacher taught us the implicit differentiation, in which he gave us a very brief explanation of implicit function. I didn't quite get it at that time so I decided to look it up a little and honestly, the concept of implicit functions just doesn't make sense to me, why are they even functions? The definitions of functions I was taught almost totally contradicts everything about implicit functions. Also, how does it make sense to differentiate something which is not even in the explicit form, $y= f(x)$ , seeing as how the definition of derivative is given using exactly that, $f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h\to0} \dfrac{ f(x+h)- f(x)}{h}$ But the main thing that concerns me is, if the implicit functions are of the form $F(x,y)=0$ (which I assume is the equation of all points lying on the curve formed on the XY plane when the surface intersects it) then why do we assume $y$ is some composite function of $x$ and find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ ? I'm really really confused right now and I have lots and lots of questions, someone pls help. EDIT : $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ , if it maps every element of $A$ to a unique element of $B$ in which case, $x^2+y^2 = 4$ fails the vertical line test.","['implicit-function', 'functions', 'implicit-differentiation']"
