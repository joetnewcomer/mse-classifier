730462,Factoring $r^8-1$,I am trying to factor $r^8-1$ after having just learned about difference and sum of cubes. I don't know what to do next though as this doesn't seem like a difference of cubes. How do I factor this in the intended way? I suppose I could just do brute force polynomial division but I don't think that is how it was intended to be factored.,['algebra-precalculus']
730464,Tricky question on induction and characteristic polynomials,"I am to prove via induction that for any $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ has degree $n$; $(-1)^n$ as the coefficient of the $\lambda ^n$ terms; $(-1)^{n-1}\cdot \text{Trace}(A)$ as the coefficient of $\lambda ^{n-1}$.

730533,What is the *exact* definition of a bounded subset in a metric space?,"I see quite a lot of different definitions of a bounded space. For instance, from nLab : Let $E$ be a metric space. A subset $B⊆E$ is bounded if there is some real number $r$ such that $d(x,y)<r$ for all $x,y∈B$ . From Wiki : A subset $S$ of a metric space $(M, d)$ is bounded if it is contained in a ball of finite radius, i.e. if there exists $x$ in $M$ and $r > 0$ such that for all $s$ in $S$ , we have $d(x, s) < r$ . If I understand it correctly, the first definition requires that the origin of the ""open disc"" must be inside the subset, whereas the second definition does not have this restriction. Are these definitions somehow the same, or are they different? If not which one is correct? The motivation for this question is because I want to understand what the Heine-Borel Theorem means.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'definition']"
730540,The effect of changing one of the matrix of matrix multiplication on the rank of the resulting new matrix?,"Consider matrix multiplication $C=AB$, where $A\in\mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}$, $B\in\mathbb{F}_q^{n\times k}$, $q$ is the finite field size (the finite field constraint is actually not relevant to the problem). The ranks of matrices are denoted as $\text{rank}(A)$, $\text{rank}(B)$ and $\text{rank}(C)$. My question is, suppose that I change some rows of $B$ to obtain a new matrix $B'$ which has $\text{rank}(B')<\text{rank}(B)$ and denote $C'=AB'$. Is that safe to say that $\text{rank}(C')<\text{rank}(C)$ (or $\text{rank}(C')\leq \text{rank}(C)$)? If yes, how to rigorously prove? What if another constraint is added to the question that $B'$ is obtained by replacing one/several row(s) of $B$ with linear combinations of existing rows of $B$? Similarly, is that possible to have a similar argument on the change of rank if $C'=A'B$ where $\text{rank}(A')<\text{rank}(A)$? Thanks.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

730564,What extra assumption makes this transformation affine?,"Let a vector space $V$ be given.  Let $f:V\to V$ have the property that for all $x,y,a\in V$,
$$
  f(x+a)-f(y+a) = f(x) - f(y) \tag{$\star$}
$$ Q1. I'd like to know how weak one can make additional assumptions to guarantee that $f$ is affine, namely that there exists a linear transformation $L:V\to V$, and an element $v\in V$ such that
\begin{align}
  f(x) = L(x) + v
\end{align}
for all $x\in V$. I think, for example, that if one assumes that $V = \mathbb R^n$, and if $f$ is differentiable, then $(\star)$ implies that $f$ is affine. This makes me think that perhaps one needs a notion of smoothness or continuity in general and therefore possibly a norm?  Also Q2. Is there a common name for the property $(\star)$?","['vector-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'continuity', 'analysis']"
730614,Is there a way to figure out the minimum number of participants or maximum number of rounds in my tournament style?,"I just finished hosting a Euchre tournament at work that was meant to get people to meet other people in the company. This is the third time I've hosted this type of tournament. The first two times, we had 28 and 36 people play 7 rounds and I could not figure out a schedule that allowed for everyone to play with another play a maximum of one time. This time, we had 80 people play 8 rounds and I had no issue guaranteeing that everyone person was scheduled against others a maximum of one time. I'm considering altering the format for our next tournament and I want to know if there is a formula or algorithm that can be used to either: Determine the maximum number of rounds (r) that can be scheduled to guarantee each person is only scheduled to play with another person a maximum of one time throughout the tournament, given p number of participants. OR Determine the minimum number of participants (p) that are needed to guarantee that each will be scheduled against another participant a maximum of one time, given r number of rounds. The format of the tournament is: for each round, I schedule 4 people to a group. They play 3 games, one with each other group member as their partner. So, each participant plays against 3 other people in each round. Points are reported to me and the sum of points/wins is totaled to determine a ranking. There is no elimination. You can assume that the number of participants is a multiple of 4. The way that I've scheduled this, up to this point, is to put the names in a column in a spreadsheet and use a formula that based on the table number (t:1-20), seat number (s:1-4), a seed number for the round (r:1,4,5,7,9,11,13,17), and number of participants (p) that would pick a person from the list and put them into that seat. The basic formula is something along the lines of i = ((((t - 1) * 4) + (s - 1)) * r + 1) % p It also accounts for if p is divisible by r by adding 1 each loop through the list. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient way to schedule, but I doubt that it is. Before the first tournament, I tried writing a program to do the schedule via recursive backtracking and it did not come up with one. I assume that this is due to the limited number of participants. I'm not sure if this is a P vs. NP issue, but it seems like there could be some elegant solution as is the case with most other tournament formats. If there is a formula or algorithm to determine this, I can keep this in mind while altering the format in the future. Thanks for any insights on this.","['algorithms', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"

730668,Building invariants of non-fundamental $SU(2)$,"Suppose you have two objects, $ \phi _i $ and $ \psi _j $ that form representations of $ SU(2) $. With both fields in the fundamental representation, I believe there is one invariant,
\begin{equation} 
\epsilon ^{ ij} \psi _i \phi _j \quad 
\end{equation} But how would I extend the these ideas to the triplet representation for example? 
I know how to use Young tableaux to abstractly write down products of tensors in terms of their reducible representations, but I'm not sure how I can use that to form singlets in general. As an example consider two doublets $\psi _i ,\phi_j $ and a triplet,$\Delta_k$ under $SU(2)$. Using Young tableaux I found,

( {\mathbf{2}} \otimes {\mathbf{2}} ) \otimes {\mathbf{3}} = {\mathbf{5}} \oplus  {\mathbf{3}} \oplus {\mathbf 1} \oplus {\mathbf 3}

$ {\bf E}[X\, |\, Y,Z] =  {\bf E}[X]$ But by blindly applying the formula from the inside out, I get an incorrect result, so I'm missing some of the behind-the-scenes reasoning: ${\bf E}\big [{\bf E}[X]\ |\, Z\big ]$ ${\bf E}\big [{\bf E}[X]] = {\bf E}[X]$ Another way I tried to think about this is that it seems like $ {\bf E}[X\, |\, Y,Z] $ is the same as ${\bf E}[X\, |\, Y,Z] | Z$.

730863,"On groups of order $p^aq^br^c$ containing elements of order $pq$, $qr$, and $pr$, but not $pqr$","Let $G$ be a solvable group of order $p^aq^br^c$ (for distinct prime $p,q,r$ ) containing elements of orders $pq$ , $qr$ , and $pr$ , but no element of order $pqr$ .  Furthermore, assume that $G$ is minimal with respect to this property, i.e. any proper subgroup of $G$ lacks a element of order $pq$ , $qr$ , or $pr$ . What are some examples of groups like this? $^\star$ Can they be characterized?  Are there additional properties that come from these conditions? $^\star$ Note : trivially, it suffices to search for groups containing elements of orders $pq$ , $qr$ , and $pr$ , but no element of order $pqr$ , as then we can just take subgroups until we find one satisfying the minimality property.  So, I would also enjoy to hear about any non-minimal examples of this type, as they contain minimal examples. Things I can tell: If any proper subgroups of $G$ have order $p^xq^yr^z$ ( $x,y,z>0$ ), they need to come in one of three type: Frobenius group whose Frobenius kernel is a $p$ -group and Frobenius complement is the product of a $q$ -group and a $r$ -group.  This means the $q$ and $r$ groups are either cyclic or generalized quaternion, and that $q^yr^z\mid p^x-1$ . Frobenius group whose Frobenius kernel is the direct product of a $q$ -group and a $r$ -group and Frobenius complement a $p$ -group.  So, $p^x\mid q^yr^z-1$ , and the $p$ -group is either cyclic or generalized quaternion. If there are no elements of order $pq$ or $qr$ , there is still a element of order $pr$ , and the group has the form $G=PQR$ (where $P$ , $Q$ , and $R$ are subgroups of corresponding prime power order) with $Q$ a cyclic $q$ -group of odd order, $R$ a cyclic $r$ -group, where $PQ$ is a Frobenius group whose kernel is $P$ and $QR$ is also a Frobenius group whose kernel is $Q$ .  (The corresponding prime congruences hold similar to #1 and #2.) I think if we make group $P$ and group $Q$ elementary abelian of dimension $r$ and then let $R$ be a cyclic group of prime order with faithful action, $$(a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_{r-1},a_r)\mapsto (a_2,a_3,\ldots, a_r,a_1)$$ (same on both $P$ and $Q$ ,) then it works, is it true?","['examples-counterexamples', 'solvable-groups', 'frobenius-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

To find arc length, $s(t)= \int_{0}^{T} \sqrt{2} dt= \sqrt{2}t |^{T}_{0}= \sqrt{2}T- \sqrt{2}(0)= \sqrt{2}T. $ So, $s= \sqrt{2}T$ or $T= \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{2}}$. Did I finish answering the question?

730937,Cantor sets and drawing figure-8s in the plane,"I know that the Cantor Set is uncountable (this is a well-known result ), so I know that there must be something wrong with the following method for counting its elements, but I'm not sure where the flaw is. I'll assume that the Cantor set in question is a subset of the interval $[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ obtained through iterative elimination of middle thirds . The point with coordinate $0$ is numbered $1$ , and the point with coordinate $1$ is numbered $2$ . After the first iteration, the middle third of the unit interval is deleted, and we find two more points that must be in the Cantor set. These are the points with coordinates $1/3$ and $2/3$ . Number them $3$ and $4$ , respectively. After the next iteration, there are four new endpoints of line segments that must now be counted. Number the points with coordinates $1/9$ , $2/9$ , $7/9$ and $8/9$ as $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , and $8$ , as depicted below. Every point in the unit interval must either not be in the Cantor set, or be the endpoint of a line segment at some finite iteration of the deletion process. But every such endpoint is numbered by the process above, so every point in the Cantor set should correspond to a non-negative integer, and vice versa. I think the problem is that there exist points that are in the Cantor set that are not endpoints of a line segment at some iteration, and so would not be counted. However, I can't think of an example of such a point ... I thought about this while musing over the following questions: Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting circles in the plane? (clearly yes, e.g. concentric circles with radii in $[0,1]$ ) Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting figure eights in the plane? (I think the answer is no, but I am not sure why) While thinking about the second of these, I considered a figure eight with two figure eights inside of it, one in each half, and two inside each of the halves of those , and so on: These figure eights are easily countable. Number the biggest one $1$ , the second biggest ones $2$ and $3$ , and so on. This is closely similar to how the points in the Cantor set are ""counted"" in the first part of this question. I'm dealing with two sets. One is the Cantor set; the other is the infinite set of nested figure eights, the first few of which are in the diagram above. The latter is clearly countable, while the former is ostensibly not. What is the difference between the two? Is there possibly some way to construct a set of figure eights with centers at points in the Cantor set so that these figure eights don't intersect? Would this be a way to draw an uncountable infinity of figure eights in the plane? If not, is there another way?","['elementary-set-theory', 'fractals']"

Edit. As an illustration, here is a proof of the equality $d(K,\mathcal U,2,0)=0$ . This case can be handled without universes. Assume that, for each vector space $V$ (over the field $K$ chosen once and for all), we have a linear map $\theta_V:V^{**}\to V$ , and suppose that, for each linear map $f:V\to W$ , we have $$
f\circ\theta_V=\theta_W\circ f^{**}.
$$ We claim: $\theta_V=0$ for all $V$ . Proof. As a general notation, put $V_1:=V^*,V_2:=V^{**},f_2:=f^{**}$ , and, for each vector space $V$ , let $\varepsilon_V:V\to V_2$ be the natural map. In particular, the above display becomes $$
f\circ\theta_V=\theta_W\circ f_2.
$$ It is easy to see that there is a scalar $\lambda\in K$ such that $\theta_V\circ\varepsilon_V=\lambda\operatorname{id}_V$ for all $V$ , and that we can assume either $\lambda=0$ or $\lambda=1$ . Case $\lambda=0$ . Since $\varepsilon_K$ is an isomorphism, we get $\theta_K=0$ . For $v_1$ in $V_1$ we have $v_1\circ\theta_V=\theta_K\circ v_{12}=0$ . Since $v_1$ is arbitrary, this implies $\theta_V=0$ . Case $\lambda=1$ . We are seeking a contradiction. For $v_1$ in $V_1$ we have $$
v_{12}=\varepsilon_K\circ\theta_K\circ v_{12}=\varepsilon_K\circ v_1\circ\theta_V,
$$ that is $$
\big(v_{12}(v_2)\big)(k_1)=\bigg(\varepsilon_K\Big(v_1\big(\theta_V(v_2)\big)\Big)\bigg)(k_1)
$$ for $v_2$ in $V_2$ and $k_1$ in $K_1$ . The last equality can be rewritten as $$
v_2(k_1\circ v_1)=k_1\Big(v_1\big(\theta_V(v_2)\big)\Big).

v_2(v_1)=v_1\big(\theta_V(v_2)\big)

We can write $A=(A \setminus B) \cup (A\cap B)$, $B=(B \setminus A) \cup (A\cap B)$, since these are disjoint unions, then $P(A)=P(A \setminus B)+P(A\cap B)$ and $P(B)=P(B \setminus A)+P(A\cap B)$. Now, $A \cup B$ can be expressed as $A \cup B= (A\setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) \cup (B \setminus A)$, which it's also union of disjoint sets, so $P(A \cup B)=P(A \setminus B)+P(A\cap B)+P(B \setminus A)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$. This proves that for $n=2$, the formula is correct.

$$P(X>n|Y=n)=\frac{P(X>n)\cdot P(Y=n)}{P(Y=n)}=P(X>n)\\ \sum_{k=n}^\infty\left(\frac56\right)^{k-1}\cdot \left(\frac16\right)=\left(\frac65\right)^{1-n}=\left(\frac56\right)^{n-1}$$
2. The second way is: We can say that ""B throw less times than A"", so let's assume that A throws the dice $n$ times. So:
$$P(Y<n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(\frac56\right)^{k-1}\cdot \left(\frac16\right)=1-\left(\frac56\right)^{n}$$ They are opposite, and I don't know which one of them is correct or both of them are incorrect.. Please help with this. Thank you!",['probability']
731272,Mentally visualizing functions of complex numbers,"I've recently been learning about functions of complex numbers (to complex numbers), and I can't quite fit them into my head. When I think about real functions, I tend to mentally visualize them as some sort of surface (a two dimensional surface, or a three-dimensional one). In this way, I can intuitively understand what it means for a function of 1, 2, or 3 real variables to be continuous or differentiable, and I can also visualize some problematic aspects of a function in order to get a hint about whether or not the function has these qualities. This intuition breaks down when dealing with complex-valued functions, so I can't really make heads or tail of them. Is there a good way of looking at this problem, from an intuitive perspective? Are there ways that you've successfully used in the past, such as in order to personally understand complex functions, or to teach students about them? Since I'm also going to learn about functions of multiple complex variables, can these methods be extended to such functions? To clarify, I am actually looking for such intuitive devices as Einstein's riding a beam of light . Notes This question is not about graphing/plotting/sketching complex functions, nor is it about visualizing functions in general, nor is it about visualizing complex numbers. There are many questions of this sort already, and I don't want this one to be perceived as a duplicate (unless someone can find an answer to this question that isn't about graphing , in which case it would be a great help).

The measure can be chosen to be right invariant, but usually not both simultaneously: if a locally compact group admits a measure which is both left and right invariant then it is said to be unimodular. Examples of unimodular groups are compact groups and abelian groups. I am interested in an intuitive characterization of unimodularity. The following will do: Something in the vein of ""simply connected"" = ""no holes"" or ""compact"" = ""bounded and with no holes"" An example of a group that fails to be unimodular with a convincing argument that this is the case, but without direct computations. I know the example of orientation preserving affine transformations on the real line, but the proof that this group is not unimodular uses the fact that this group is homeomorphic to a manifold.

731512,What does the Yoneda lemma say for the identity functor and finite sets?,"So I try to plug in the simplest arguments into the Yoneda lemma and see how to interpret it. I'll try it for the identity functor and the category of finite sets, in particular, I use an three element object $\{a,b,c\}$ The lemma says the following relation for functors $F:{\bf C}\to{\bf Set}$ holds, naturally: $$\mathrm{nat}\left(\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf C}(-,A),F\right)\cong F(A).$$ I came to view this as a result about the morphisms in the functor category ${{\bf Set}^{\bf C}}$ , i.e. $$\mathrm{Hom}_{{\bf Set}^{\bf C}}\left(\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf C}(-,A),F\right)\cong F(A).$$ Now for my example this says $$\mathrm{Hom}_{{\bf Set}^{\bf Fin}}\left(\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf Fin}(-,\{a,b,c\}),\mathrm{id_{{\bf Set}^{\bf Fin}}}\right)\cong \{a,b,c\}.$$ So that seems to say that I can collapse the functions from any object $B$ into $\{a,b,c\}$ into the identity, the object $B$ itself, in exactly three ways. I don't see it, have I misinterpret the result? How does the $\bf Fin$ and three object example work properly? edit / solution: In an answer, Stefan Hamcke pointed out I stated a contra-variant version (i.e. the one where $A$ is on the right hand side in $\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf C}(-,A)$ ) which doesn't work with the identity (because it doesn't flip arrow-orientation). Here I try to fix it: The co-variant version $$\mathrm{nat}\left(\mathrm{Hom}_{\bf C}(A,-),F\right)\cong F(A),$$ would say $$\mathrm{nat}\left(({\{a,b,c\}}\to -),\mathrm{id}(-)\right)\cong \{a,b,c\},$$ i.e. there are 3 natural transforms from any function space ${\{a,b,c\}}\to B$ to $B$ . Now if $B,C\in{\bf Fin}$ and $fromB\ :\ B\to C,$ is a generic function in that category, then naturality means that taking a function $toB\ :\ {\{a,b,c\}}\to B$ via the natural transformation $\tau$ to $\mathrm{id}(B)=B$ (i.e. mapping $toB$ to an element $\beta\in B$ ) and then going along $\mathrm{id}(fromB)=fromB$ (i.e. end up with $fromB(\beta)\in C$ ), that is the same as taking my function $toB$ to the function $fromB\circ toB\ :\ \{a,b,c\}\to C$ and then choosing, via $\tau$ , an element from the codomain $C$ . I got the feeling the natural transformations $\tau\ :\ (\{a,b,c\}\to -)\to \mathrm{id}(-)$ are the three maps "" $\mathrm{eval}$ at one of $\{a,b,c\}$ "", i.e. $f\ \mapsto\ f(x),$ where $x$ either $a,b$ or $c$ .","['category-theory', 'transformation', 'intuition', 'abstract-algebra']"

Why is it that $\zeta(s)\neq0$ for $\operatorname{Re}(s)=0$ (that is, there are no non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function lying on this line)? My guess would be that this follows from the zeta functional equation:
$$
\zeta(s)=2(2\pi)^{s-1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s)

and the symmetry of zeroes about the line $\operatorname{Re}(s)=1/2$.

I wondered then if we can further say that this holds for $0\leq\operatorname{Re}(s)\leq1$, where $s\neq1$?

$$ Problem 2 Prove: $A \times B = A \times C \Rightarrow B = C$. A similar problem and I must show that $B \subseteq C$ and $C \subseteq B$. Proof: Case 1:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{let} (a,b) \in A \times B\, \text{and}\, (a,c) \in A \times C \\
\text{since}\, A \times B = A \times C \text{,}\, \forall (a,b)\text{,} (a,b) = (a,c) \\
\text{so,}\, a = a\, \text{and}\, b=c \\
\text{thus}\, \forall b \in B, b \in C\,\square
\end{align}
$$ Case 2:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{let} (a,c) \in A \times C\, \text{and}\, (a,b) \in A \times B \\
\text{since}\, A \times C = A \times B \text{,}\, \forall (a,c)\text{,} (a,c) = (a,b) \\
\text{so,}\, a = a\, \text{and}\, c=b \\
\text{thus}\, \forall c \in C, c \in B\,\square

732004,Are integers mod n a unique factorization domain?,"I am trying to learn abstract algebra from scratch, jolly stuff, but in the process of doing so this puzzles me: Having a ring of integers mod $n$, where $n=pq$ is composite, as I understand we have that  $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) (by this question ). Therefore by the pretty chain of inclusions located here , it is also a unique factorization domain. And this is where I am lost, as I keep thinking of for example $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ where I can have $4\equiv 2\cdot2 \equiv 2\cdot2\cdot5 \bmod 8$. Also, $p\cdot q \equiv 0 \bmod n$ which gives two non-zero divisors of zero. In my world, this means that $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ is not a UFD and not even integral domain. I feel like I am missing something very simple yet crucial :-).","['modular-arithmetic', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

I know that the Handshaking Lemma says that the sum of the degrees is twice the number of edges. In this case the number of edges is 20, which means that the graph must exist. However, the part I'm iffy about is can a simple graph have a vertex with degree zero?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
