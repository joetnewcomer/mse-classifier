2492069,Pullback of ideal sheaf defining closed immersion,"Let $Z\to X$ be a closed immersion with ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}$. To me the exact sequence $0\to\mathcal{I}\to \mathcal{O}_X\to i_*\mathcal{O}_Z\to 0$ says that the functions in $\mathcal{I}$ are precisely those functions that vanish when we pull them back along $Z\to X$. Based on this interpretation, I would expect that $i^*\mathcal{I}=0$, since we pull back functions that vanish when we pull them back. However, $i^*\mathcal{I}$ is actually the conormal sheaf, and hence not zero. I can do computations to see that $i^*\mathcal{I}$ is indeed the conormal sheaf in the sense that the dimensions of the fibers are indeed the codimension of $Z$ in $X$, so it works out. What I do not understand is why my first reasoning fails. It fails because its not true, but it suggests that I'm not thinking about the ideal sheaf exact sequence in a correct way. So I hope that someone can point out the flaw in the first reasoning.","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2492189,Prove or disprove : $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{4+\sqrt{16+\sqrt{256...}}}} = \sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}}$,"Edit: My initial question was regarding the expressions: $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{4+\sqrt{16+\sqrt{64... + \sqrt{4^{n}}}}}}$ And in general: $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{k+\sqrt{k^2+\sqrt{k^3... + \sqrt{k^{n}}}}}}$ And their limits, however, my working out was wrong. So, if someone can explain how to find the values of the above two expressions, that would be great! This is just something I've noticed playing around with the radicals, and I honestly don't have much idea on how to prove it. These were my ideas: Let $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{4+\sqrt{16+\sqrt{256... + \sqrt{4^{2^n}}}}}} = A_n$ My logic was as follows: $A_n = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{4+\sqrt{16+\sqrt{256... + \sqrt{4^{2^n}}}}}}$ $A_n^2 = 1 + \sqrt{4+\sqrt{16+\sqrt{256... + \sqrt{4^{2^n}}}}}$ $A_n^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{16+\sqrt{256... + \sqrt{4^{2^n}}}}}$ $A_n^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{16}\sqrt{256+... + \sqrt{4^{2^n}}}}}$ $A_n^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+... + \sqrt{1}}}}$ $A_{\infty}^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+... }}} = 1 + 2\phi = 2 + \sqrt{5}$ $A_{\infty} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{5}}$ Then, rather than this specific case, how would we evaluate: $L = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{k+\sqrt{k^2+\sqrt{k^4+\sqrt{k^8+...}}}}}$ Would we also get $L = \sqrt{\sqrt{k}\phi + 1}$? And what about expressions such as: $\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{2+\sqrt{3+...}}}$ Thanks for any answers and guidance!","['radicals', 'nested-radicals', 'limits-without-lhopital', 'limits']"

Formally, the $\sigma$-algebra on $A$ is $\mathcal{A}=\{ S \cap A \mid S \in \mathcal{X} \}$.

Certainly i think the right hand side would reduce to $$\frac{an(an-1)(an-2)...((a-1)n+1)}{n(n-1)(n-2)...2\cdot 1}$$ But I'm not seeing how this could reduce better to show there is a factor of $n+1$ left.

2492346,Understanding the proof of $l_2$ being complete.,"Let $l_2$ be the collection of bounded real sequences $x = (x_n)$ for which $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|x_n|^2<\infty$. I have to prove that $l_2$ is complete (that every Cauchy sequence in $l_2$ converges to a point in $l_2$). Proof: Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence in $l_2$, where now we write $f_n = (f_n(k))_{k=1}^{\infty}$, and suppose that $(f_n)$ is Cauchy in $l_2$. That is, suppose that for each $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $n_0$ such that $||f_n - f_m||_2 < \epsilon$ whenever $m,n \geq n_0$. We now want to show that $(f_n)$ converges, in the metric of $l_2$, to some $f\in l_2$. 1) First show that $f(k) = lim_{n\to \infty}\,f_n(k)$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$ for each k: To see why, note that $|\,f_n(k) - f_m(k)|\leq ||\,f_n - f_m||_2$ for any k, and hence $(f_n(k))_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb{R}$ for each k. Thus, $f$ is the obvious candidate for the limit of $(f_n)$, but we still have to show that the convergence takes place in the metric space $l_2$; that is, we need to show that $f\in l_2$ and that $||\,f_n - f||_2 \to 0$ (as $n \to \infty$). 2) Now show that $f\in l_2$; that is, $||\,f||_2 < \infty$. We know that $(f_n)$ is bounded in $l_2$; say, $||f_n||\leq B$ for all n. Thus, for any fixed $N < \infty$, we have: $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}|\,f(k)|^2 = lim_{n\to\infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}|\,f_n(k)|^2 \leq B^2$. Since this holds for any N, we get that $||\,f||_2\leq B$. 3) Now we repeat step 2 (more or less) to show that $f_n \to f$ in $l_2$. Given any $\epsilon > 0$ choose $n_0$ such that $||\,f_n - f_m||_2 < \epsilon$ whenever $m,n > n_0$. Then, for any N and any $n\geq n_0$, $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}|\,f(k) - f_n(k)|^2 = lim_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{N}|\,f_m(k) - f_n(k)|^2 \leq \epsilon^2$. Since this holds for any N, we have $||\,f - f_n||_2 \leq \epsilon$ for all $n\geq n_0$. That is, $f_n \to f$ in $l_2$. Questions: I think I understand the general idea of the proof. You take a sequence and suppose it's Cauchy. You then have to show that it has a limit and thus converges, and show that the limit lies in $l_2$, which would mean that any Cauchy sequence in $l_2$ is convergent to a point in $l_2$. So why is step 3 necessary? I must be mistaken, but it seems to me that in step 1 and 2 it has already been proven that the chosen sequence has a limit and that it lies in $l_2$. I don't understand the notation that is used in this proof: ""Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence in $l_2$, where we now write $f_n = (f_n(k))_{k=1}^{\infty}$"". Why is the letter $k$ added to the sequence and what does it mean? If you have a sequence $x_n$, the subscript is the argument right? Can't you write $x_n$ like $x\,(n)$? Why does $|\,f_n(k) - f_m(k)|\leq||\,f_n - f_m||_2$ imply that $f_n(k)$ has a limit? Perhaps this will be clear once I understand the use of the letter $k$.

2492770,All smooth real functions are related by coordinate change?,"Suppose you have two smooth functions $F,G:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with the property that none of the partial derivatives vanish anywhere.  I wonder if it's possible to find functions  $P:\mathbb{R}^n\leftrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $$G = Q\circ F\circ P.$$ I feel like it should be possible, using Jacobians or something as a change of coordinates, but I'm not sure how to begin or if I need further restrictions. If this result is true, it would imply that in some sense all real functions of this form with non-vanishing partial derivatives are equivalent through a kind of change of coordinates. Here's a solution for a special case. If the dimension is $n=1$, then $F$ and $G$ are smooth monotone functions and are therefore invertible. Let $P$ be the identity function, and let $Q=G\circ F^{-1}$. Of course, if $F$ is not also surjective, then $Q$ is not well-defined everywhere; perhaps it is possible to extend $Q$ to all of $\mathbb{R}$, though I'm not sure how smoothly. And if the dimension $n>1$, then here is a sketch of what I think shows the result: Intuitively, there ought to be (integral?) curves $\gamma_1,\gamma_2:\mathbb{R}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ through the domains of $F$ and $G$ such that $F\circ \gamma_1$ is a monotonic function passing through all possible values of $F$, and similarly for $G$. These curves define a fixed transformation between the codomains of $F$ and $G$, by $Q\equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F\circ \gamma_1)^{-1}$. Intuitively, it should be possible to parametrize the graphs of $F$ and $G$ using $n$ coordinates, where the first coordinate tells you the level and the remaining coordinates uniquely specify a point in the domain with that level. Because of the conditions on $F$ and $G$, I expect these can be expressed as smooth functions $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. In another way of looking at it, there should be smooth functions $T_1, T_2 : \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which carry points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ smoothly and invertibly through all other points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the same $F$ (respectively $G$) level. We think of the second argument as being the point $x$, and the first argument as being a ""displacement"" within the level surface at $F(x)$. (I am a little concerned about level sets shaped like $n$-spheres, in which case this construction doesn't work invertiblyâ€” but perhaps such level sets are not possible if $F$, $G$ have everywhere nonzero partials. In that case, the level sets will be sort of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$-shaped, always.) By combining the flow functions $T_i$ and the canonical curves $\gamma_i$, we obtain functions $H_i \equiv T_i(s, \gamma_i(t))$ which send $\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}$ smoothly into all of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Intuitively, there should be a smooth isomorphism $P:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which sends the level sets of $G$ to the level sets of $F$. In particular, we should be able to pick one which sends the canonical points $\gamma_2(\mathbb{R})$ to the canonical points $\gamma_1(\mathbb{R})$ so that $P\circ \gamma_2 = \gamma_1$. We can do so concretely by defining $P(x) = H_1\circ H_2^{-1}$ Hence our solution is to use $Q\equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F\circ \gamma_1)^{-1}$, sending levels of $F$ monotonically to levels of $G$, and $P\equiv H_1\circ H_2^{-1}$, sending level sets of $G$ to level sets of $F$ in a monotonic-like way. (specifically, if $G(x) < G(y)$, then $F\circ P(x) < F\circ P(y)$ or something like that). (Here, $H_2^{-1}$ looks up the unique way of expressing point $x$ as ""distance"" traveled along a $G$-level curve from some canonical other point with the same $G$-level. The result is a flow amount $s$; $H_1$ looks up the point with the same $F$-level as $x$ and applies the flow amount $s$ to it, resulting in a uniquely defined new point $x^\prime$, with certain special properties.) Does this kind of construction work? I think if $n>1$ then we can construct $H_i$ as follows: because the partials of $F$ and $G$ don't vanish, we should be able to find unit vector fields $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ which are smooth and perpendicular to the gradients of $F$ and $G$, respectively; then the flow functions $H_i$ can simply translate along the integral surfaces of these vector fields.  I think the only obstacle I see is if the integral surfaces are of incompatible shapeâ€” for example, if one is a line and the other a circle. But maybe the level surfaces can't be things like circles, because then the functions $F$ and $G$ wouldn't have everywhere nonvanishing partials (?). Here's a concrete example of this construction for if $F$ is the sum function and $G$ is the multiplication function (ignoring the fact that $G$'s level sets have many branches): We can pick canonical curves $\gamma_1(t) = \langle \vec{0}, t \rangle$ and $\gamma_2(t) = \langle \vec{1}, t\rangle$ so that $F\circ \gamma_1$ and $G\circ \gamma_2$ pass through all possible values. These curves define the level-transforming function $Q \equiv (G\circ \gamma_2) \circ (F \circ \gamma_{1})^{-1}$; in this case, you can find that $Q$ is just the identity. We can pick flow functions to send points to all other points on the same level surface : $T_1(s,x) = x + \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}, \sum_i s_i\rangle$. $T_2(s, x) \equiv x \cdot \bar{s}$, where $\bar{s} \equiv \langle e^{s_1}, \ldots, e^{s_{n-1}}, e^{\sum_i s_i}\rangle.$ In combination with the canonical curves $\gamma_i$, these flow functions give us $H_i(s,t) = T_i(s, \gamma_i(t))$. Here, $H_1(s,t) = \langle \vec{s}, t - \sum_i s_i\rangle$ and $H_2(s,t) = \langle e^\vec{s}, t\cdot e^{-\sum_i s_i} \rangle$. Hence we define $P \equiv H_1 \circ H_{2}^{-1}$. To be clear, $H_2^{-1}(y) = \langle \log{y_1}, \ldots, \log{y_{n-1}}, \prod_i y_i \rangle$. In which case, $$P(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \langle \log{x_1}, \ldots, \log{x_{n-1}}, \prod_i x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \log{x_i}\rangle$$ And we find that $Q\circ F \circ P = F \circ P = \prod_i x_i = G$ (if you add up all the entries in $P$, the log terms all cancel and you're left with the product.) There are of course other $P$ and $Q$ with this same effect; it all depends on the choice of canonical curve $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$, for instance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'jacobian']"

2492941,Proving $3^n+2(17^n)$ can't be a perfect square for all positive integers n.,"I think I have a valid proof of this question, but as my textbook doesn't provide an answer, I would appreciate some clarification. Let $f(n)=3^n+2(17^n)$, and the question asks to show $f(n)$ is never a perfect square for positive integers n. Using quadratic residues, we see: $x^2(mod 5)$ is either $ 0, 1, 4 $ only. Taking $f(n)$ and breaking it up into $3^n$ and $2(17^n)$, we can see the following modulo-periodic sequences taking each part $mod5$ The sequence of $3^n (mod5)$ is: $ 3, 4, 2, 1 ,3...$, with a period of $4$, for positive integers $n$. The sequence of $2(17^n)$ $(mod5)$ is : $4, 3, 1, 2, 4...$, with a period of 4. Hence, $f(n)$ $(mod 5)$ is equal to the sum of each corresponding element in each sequence, taken $(mod 5)$. This produces the sequence: $2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2.....$ Hence, $f(n)$ $(mod5)$ leaves remainders of $2$ and $3$ only, and as a square $(mod5)$ leaves remainders of $0, 1, 4$ only, $f(n)$ can never be a perfect square.

2492975,Sup of measure of intersection points,"This is a problem I've thought up myself while travelling in a car, and I have no idea how to solve it.
Let $f: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ be bijection. Consider unit square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, and label one edge $x$ and the opposite edge $f(x)$. Connect all points $x$ in the $x$ edge to their corresponding points $f(x)$ in the $f(x)$ edge with straight lines. For any function $f(x)$ as described before, let $A(f)$ be the set of points where two or more lines intersect.
The question is this. If $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure, when taken for all bijections $f(x)$ for which $\mu(A(f))$ exists,  what is $\sup \mu(A(f))$? Clearly, considering
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      x + 1/2 & 0< x < 1/2 \\
      x - 1/2 & x \geq 1/2\\
      1 & x = 0

The square is illustrated in the image below from which we get that
$$ \mu(A(f)) = 1/4$$
and so 
$$\frac{1}{4}\leq \sup \mu(A(f))\leq 1$$
The illustration below shows what the square with the lines looks like for $f(x) = 1-x$. In this case, $A(f)$ is clearly $\{(1/2,1/2)\}$ and so $\mu(A(f)) = 0$","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'geometry', 'general-topology']"

In teaching improper integrals over infinite intervals, I come across this example in my lecture notes, $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \ dx$$ Naturally, the integration is split into two halves, such as $\int_{-\infty}^{0}x\ dx=-\infty$ and $\int_{0}^{\infty}x\ dx=\infty$. The lecture notes conclude that since both these improper integrals diverge, then so does the above improper integral, i.e. $$\Rightarrow\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\ dx\ \mathrm{diverges}$$ Intuitively, however, I would expect that the first improper integral, $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\ dx$ should evaluate to $0$, given that, An intuitive meaning of the definite integral is the area under the curve The curve of $y=x$ gives a negative area for $(-\infty,0)$ and positive area for $(0, \infty)$ The curve of $y=x$ is symmetrical about $y=0$ So, my questions are Why is this not the case, and Is $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\ dx\ \mathrm{diverges}$ even what I think it means, that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\ dx=\infty$?","['limits', 'calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'integration', 'infinity']"
2493445,Error in calculation of $\pi$ using Monte Carlo method.,"So lets say we are trying to calculate value of $\pi$ using MonteCarlo method. By picking random points in a square and measuring their distance from the center and if $k$ points lie inside the circle using the ratio $\frac{k}N$ to calculate the value of $\pi$. How do I derive the formula for variance of the calculated value of $\pi$? This is what I have got so far. Say the probability that the point lies inside the circle is $p$. Say we have N random points in the square, of which k lie inside the circle. The probability that k points lie inside the circle is $\binom{N}{k}p^k(1-p)^{N-k}$. The error in estimate of $\pi$ is $e=||c\pi-\frac{N}k||$. So the expected value of error $E(e) = \sum_{k=0}^{k=N}\left\|c\pi-\frac{N}k\right\|\binom{N}{k}p^k(1-p)^{N-k}$?

2493520,Kalman decomposition using Hautus test,"In linear control theory, the Kalman decomposition is used as a similarity transformation to decompose a given linear time-invariant system $$\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)$$
$$y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$$ into its controllable & observable, controllable & not observable, not controllable & observable and not controllable & not observable subsystems. A system is controllable if $\mathcal{C}=[B\quad AB \quad A^2B \ldots A^{n-1}B]^T$ has rank $n$ (number of rows/columns of the system matrix $A$). A system is observable if $\mathcal{O}=[C \quad CA \quad CA^2 \ldots CA^{n-1}]^T$ has rank $n$ (number of rows/columns of the system matrix $A$). It seems possible to construct the similarity transformation by using the eigenvectors of the Hautus test for controllability and observability. It states a system is controllable if for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $A$ the matrix $[A-\lambda I\quad B]$ has full rank $n$ for a $n \times n$ system matrix $A$. A similar statement reads: A system is observable if for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $A$ the matrix $[A^T - \lambda I \quad C^T]$ has full rank $n$ for a $n \times n$ system matrix $A$. The user fibonatic from Engineering Stack Exchange suggested that one could construct the similarity transformation for the Hautus test. I am wondering, how this is possible. This is the same example as in the post on Engineering Stack Exchange. $$\dot{x} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}x + \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} u$$
$$y = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} x$$ The similarity transfromation is given by 
$$
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
This is what I have tried. The three eigenvalues of $A$ are all $\lambda =1$ the eigenvectors are $v_1 = [1, 0,0]^T, v_2=[0,0,1]^T$ and $v_3=[1,0,1]^T$. The rank of the $[A-\lambda B]$ is 2. That means there is a deficit in rank for every eigenvector. If I include the eigenvectors to a ""similarity"" transformation $$\tilde{M} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$ it turns out that it is singular and cannot be the similarity transformation that I need. So how can I use the Hautus test to construct the similarity

2493851,Sanity check: does $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ exceed TREE(3)?,"TREE(3) For the Golf a number bigger than TREE(3) challenge I wrote a program but I'm not sure it is bigger than TREE(3). The function TREE(k) gives the length of the longest sequence of trees T1, T2, ... where each vertex is labelled with one of k colours, the tree Ti has at most i vertices, and no tree is a minor of any tree following it in the sequence. TREE(1) = 1, with e.g. T1 = (1). TREE(2) = 3: e.g. T1 = (1); T2 = (2)--(2); T3 = (2). Because of my limited knowledge of TREE(k) and ordinals I decided to post a question here first before submitting my answer. You can view the code and a limited explanation here but I will define and  explain the D function here. Notation My program is highly recursive, it produces functions to put inside other functions. $\omega_0=0$,  $\omega_1=\omega$,  $\omega_1=\Omega$,... $\alpha_n$ means $cf(\alpha)=\omega_n$
so $\alpha_0$ means $\alpha$ is a natural number I will represent ordinals as functions (in lambda calculus) which their fundamental sequence (e.g. $\omega_1\cdot 2=\lambda x_0. \omega_1+x_0$) and call these functions using square brackets e.g. $(\omega_1\cdot 2)[5]=\omega+5$ Definition $\omega_n=\lambda \alpha_k. \alpha_k$ with $k<n$ $\alpha_n+1=\lambda \beta_n. \alpha_n$ $D_\alpha(\beta)=H'_\alpha(H'_\alpha(\beta))=H'^{2}_\alpha(\beta)$ $H'_0(\alpha_n)=\alpha_n+1$ $H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\beta_k)=D_{H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\omega_n)}(\beta_k)$ if $k<n$ $H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\beta_n)=D_{\alpha_{n+1}[\beta_n]}(\beta_n)$ $H'_{\alpha_0+1}(\beta_n)=D_{\alpha_0}(\beta_n)$ $H'_{\alpha_{k+1}}(\beta_n)=\lambda \gamma_k. D_{\alpha_{k+1}[\gamma_k]}(\beta_n)$ if $0\le k<n$ My number is $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ but I can easily change it to $D_{\omega_{10^9}}(9)$ if required. In words $\omega_n$ is the identity function for ordinals of smaller cofanity. The successor of $\alpha$ is the function that returns $\alpha$ for all input (this is to avoid having to handle successor and limit ordinals separately ) $D$ is the doubling function it iterates $H'$ once. This is a balance between the hardy hierarchy , which doesn't iterate at all, and the fast-growing hierarchy , which iterates n times. $H'_0$ is the successor function, both for functions and numbers $H'_\alpha(\beta)$ : if the domain of $\alpha$ is so large a size smaller could still fit $\beta$, use $H'$ on $\alpha$ until the domain is just large enough. (this is a way to avoid having multiple calls to H' in my code e.g. $\alpha_1=H'_{\omega_2}(\omega_1)$ and $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is just large enough use $\alpha[\beta]$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is too small : if $\alpha$ is an integer use it's predecessor. else define the result to be the function that uses $\alpha[\gamma]$ as
the new subscript when $\gamma$ is put in. The result has the same
domain as $\alpha$ note : $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_m \text{ if } m\le n \text{ or } n=0$ $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_n \text{ if } n<m$ The ordinal interpretation You don't have to read this is you don't want. The question is if $D_{\omega_9}(9)>TREE(3)$. But I want to give some more explanation for why I believe my number is bigger than TREE(3). The functions in program have strong similarities with ordinals
This is the definition for the set of tree-ordinals with order type $n$:
$$\alpha\in T_n \Leftrightarrow
 \begin{cases}
\alpha=0\\
\alpha=\beta+1 \text{ and } \beta\in T_n\\
\alpha:T_k\mapsto T_n \text{ with } k<n\\
\end{cases}$$ Note $T_k \subset T_n \text{ if } k<n$ but except for this it perfectly aligns with the explanation I gave earlier. $T_0$ is still the set of natural numbers, since the 3rd rule, which generates all the limit ordinals, can't be used yet. My definition of $\omega_n$ is different than usual, usually $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal ($\Omega$) but for me that's $\omega_2$ I did this to keep $\alpha_n \in T_n$ Notation interpreted as ordinals $\alpha_{k}$ is an ordinal with  order type k ( $k=\min(n:\alpha\in T_n)$ ) $\alpha_n[\beta_k]$ is the $\beta$th element of $\alpha$'s fundamental sequence. This is defined when $k<n$. The ordinal idea behind my number I believe $\omega_9$ acts as on ordinal about the size of $\tau[9]$ in $H'$. Since $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$, My number $D_{\omega_9}(9)=H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)\approx H'^{2}_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{Ï‘(Î©^Ï‰ Ï‰)+1}(9)>TREE(9)$ $H'$ is a modified version of the Hardy Hierarchy . The idea behind $H'$ is that $H'_{\alpha+1}$ = $H'^{2}_{\alpha}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\alpha_n+\omega_n} \text{ iterates } H'_{\alpha_n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$. You can find a proof here . Than the idea of an ordinal hierarchy was expended from a using a countable ordinal to generate huge integers, to use huge $\alpha_{n+1}$ to generate huge $\beta_n$. The 5th definition was than added to iterate $H'$ on the ordinal slot. If I did this correctly this should mean that $H'_{\omega_{n+k}}(n)>f_\tau(n)$ for some reasonably small k. Examples These early expansions created a lot of insight into my function for me, so I'll post them here too. Some very early expansions The 5th definition makes $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ expand to $H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(D_{\alpha_1}(9)))))))))$ $= H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(H_{\alpha_1}(D_{\alpha_1[9]}(9))))))))))$ $$\alpha_8=H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)=D_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)=H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))$$
\begin{align}
\ \alpha_7 & = H'_{\alpha_8}(\omega_7) \\
& = D_{\alpha_8[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\
& = D_{H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\

\end{align} \begin{align}
\ \alpha_6 & =H'_{\alpha_7}(\omega_6) \\
\ & = D_{\alpha_7[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\
\ & = D_{H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(\omega_7))[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\
\ & = \ ...
\end{align} $$\alpha_5=H'_{\alpha_6}(\omega_5)$$
$$\alpha_4=H'_{\alpha_5}(\omega_4)$$
$$\alpha_3=H'_{\alpha_4}(\omega_3)$$
$$\alpha_2=H'_{\alpha_3}(\omega_2)$$
$$\alpha_1=H'_{\alpha_2}(\omega_1)$$ If you want too truly experience the madness I recommend trying to work out $\alpha_1[3]$ but I didn't get very far. Some very approximate expansions \begin{align}
D_{\omega_9}(9) & = H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)  \\
 & > H'_{\omega_9}(9) \\ 
 & = D_{H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)}(9) \\
 & > D_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\ 
 & > H'_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\
 & > H'_{\omega_{7}^2}(9)\\
 & > H'_{2 â†‘^{\omega_{6}} \omega_{6}}(9)\\
 & >  ...
\end{align} Conclusion I couldn't get past $\omega_6$ and I ignored all the iteration of D so once $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ is finally reached the computer will have to work back up trough all of those extra iterations too. But that wouldn't even be necessary because $f_{Ï‘(Î©^Ï‰ Ï‰)}(9)>TREE(3)$ so if $\alpha_1>Ï‘(Î©^Ï‰ Ï‰)$ my number should be big enough. So is $\alpha_1>Ï‘(Î©^Ï‰ Ï‰)$?

2494065,Confusion about centraliser of $D_5$ in $GL_4(\mathbb{Z})$,"I am trying to follow a derivation on a very old paper. My knowledge of group theory is limited, I have the basis but not much experience with advanced concepts. We are working in 4 dimensions, so the paper quotes the 4D representations of the generators of $D_5$, $r$ (a rotation by $\pi/5$) and $p$ (the reflection $x \rightarrow x, y \rightarrow y$) as:
$$
\mathcal{R}(r) = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -1  \\

0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
\end{array} \right ).
$$ Question 1 : I thought all dihedral groups had irreducible representations of at most 2 dimensions, hence all >2 dimensional representations should be constructed from direct sums of these (so block diagonals)? Where do they get these expressions from? Then we calculate the centraliser of $D_5$ in $GL_4(\mathbb{Z})$, i.e. the largest subgroup of $GL_4(\mathbb{Z})$ which commutes with $D_5$. Unfortunately they skip directly to the answer because apparently ""computing these groups in straightforward"". The generators of the centraliser $C$ are given by: $$
\mathcal{R}(\delta) = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
-1 & 1 & 0 & -1  \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1  \\
-1 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
-1 & 0 & 1 & -1  \\

\mathcal{R}(\tau) = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
\end{array} \right ).
$$ Question 2 : where do these come from? Is it there something very trivial that I'm not getting? Where would I even start? My attempts : 1)I started this by building a 4D representation of $D_5$ just by direct summing its 2D irreps. I am using $r_{2D}$ as the 2D rotation matrix and $p_{2D} = \left (\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0   \\
0 & -1   \\
\end{array} \right ), 
$, to then make $
\mathcal{R}(r_{4D}) = \left (\begin{array}{cc}
r_{2D} & 0  \\
0 & r_{2D}  \\
\end{array} \right ), 
$
$
\mathcal{R}(p_{4D}) = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1  \\
\end{array} \right ),
$
etc. 2) I used the generic element of $GL_4(\mathbb{Z})$ as $
\beta = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c & d  \\
e & f & g & h  \\
i & l & m & n  \\
q & s & t & u  \\
\end{array} \right ). 
$ Then I brute-forced computed the relationships between the entries by requiring $h$ to commute with every element $d$ of $D_5$: $h^{-1}dh = d$. I found that the matrix above is reduced to $\beta = \left (\begin{array}{ccc}
a & 0 & c & 0  \\
0 & a & 0 & c  \\
s & 0 & u & 0  \\
0 & s & 0 & u  \\
\end{array} \right ). $ However this is where I stop, for I don't know how to compute the generator of the group of these matrices.","['finite-groups', 'dihedral-groups', 'group-theory']"

We wish to show that $x \to \int f(y)K(x,y)$ is $A$-measurable. My thought process: Call the function in question $g(x)$. For our function to be $A$-measurable, we need that for any $b \in B$ $g^{-1}(b) \in A$. Now, we assumed $f$ is $B$-measurable and we know that by definition, for each $x \in X$, $b \to K(x,b)$ is a measure on $(Y,B)$.

In text books and online tutorials always say that one should derive the CRLB of the estimator. If the variance of the estimator is greater than equal to the inverse of the Fisher information, then we say that no  other better estimator exists. The inverse of the Fisher information is the CRLB.  If the variance is equal to the CRLB, then the estimator is efficient. Intuitively, an estimator is nothing but a formula or an expression that is used to find an unknown value/ parameter. 1) Is there a better intuitive way to explain what CRLB bound tells us and why we need it? 2) What is meant by efficient estimator and efficiency to do what? With what do we compare the efficiency of an estimator.

2494306,Restricting the codomain of a smooth map of manifolds to a submanifold is not necessarily smooth.,"In John Lee's introduction to smooth manifold book he gives the following example: Example 5.28: Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the figure eight submanifold with the topology and smooth structure induced by the immersion $\beta:(-\pi,pi)$; $\beta(t)=(\sin2t,\sin t)$. Define a smooth map $G: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ by $G(t)=(\sin2t,\sin t)$. The image of $G$ clearly lies in $S$, but as a map from $\mathbb{R}$ to $S$ it is not even continuous because $\beta^{-1} \circ G$ is not continuous at $t=\pi$. I am confused why he is looking at the composition $\beta^{-1}\circ G$ to show that $G$ is not continuous. I think that since $\beta$ is a diffeomorphism, then if $G$ were continuous then this composition would have to be continuous. But I still don't comprehend why we need to look a the composition to show it's discontinuous. Update:
  Okay so I think I've figured it out. This has to do with the topology given to the image of injective smooth immersion. It goes as follows: Let $F: N \rightarrow M$ be an injective smooth immersion. Then as in the proof of Lee's proposition 5.18, $S=F(N)$ is topologized by delcaring $U \subset S$ open iff $F^{-1}(U) \subset N$ is open. In the case at hand our $F$ is the map $\beta$. It's easy to see from how the image of $\beta$ traces out the figure-eight that at $t=\pi$ that the image of the composition $\beta^{-1}\circ G$ jumps from points near $\pi$ back down to zero which is obviously a discontinuity.","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

2494408,Tangent lines to a curve passing through a given point,"Here is a cool exercise from Shafarevich's book (Ex. 7 in Chapter 1, Section 1): Given an irreducible (affine) plane curve $C$ over a field of characteristic
  $0$, and point $P$ in the plane, prove that there are only finitely
  many lines through $P$ that are tangent to $C$ at some point. Remark 1. In terms of the dual curve, this implies that, if $\operatorname{char}(k)=0$, then $C^{*}$ has no line as a component (because a line in a dual projective space exactly corresponds to the set of lines passing through a given point $P$). Remark 2. The conclusion is false if the characteristic is positive. Indeed, it is not hard to show that for the plane curve $y=x^{p+1}$ where $p=\operatorname{char}(k)>0$, every line through the origin is tangent to this curve (this example is the earlier part of the same exercise). I am aware that a problem similar to this has been discussed in Number of tangent lines to an algebraic curve passing through a given point However, the solution there uses the language of polar curves and proves something more precise for smooth curves. I think there should be a satisfactory proof that works for irreducible curves, and just shows finiteness of tangent lines through a given point. Attempt. Let's try the special case when $y=f(x)$ is the equation of the plane algebraic curve. After translating variables, we can assume that $P=(0, 0)$ is the origin. Then every line through the origin has the equation $y=mx$. We want to show that there are only finitely many values of $m$ for which the equation $mx=f(x)$ has a repeated root. This is where we need to use characteristic $0$ assumption. Maybe we can analyze the discriminant? Also, this is just a special case and most curves don't have the form $y=f(x)$. Overkill. I am fairly certain that Bertini's theorem can give the solution immediately. Indeed, the lines through a given point $P$ defines a linear system. This induces a linear system of divisors on the curve $C$ (by intersecting the lines with $C$). Since we are in characteristic $0$, Bertini's theorem guarantees that a general member of this linear series will be non-singular, which just means that a general line through $P$ will intersect the curve at distinct points (i.e. transversely).

Observe that for any choice of distance $\epsilon$ exists an arbitrarily close $u+vi$ such that $u+vi$ is the solution to $x^{2^j} = 1$ for some set of positive $j$ and therefore $\Delta(u+vi) = +\infty$. So if $\Delta(a+bi)=-\infty$ then for any positive $\epsilon$ one can find a point on the unit disk where $\Delta(u+vi) = +\infty$. So rigorously this means nothing.

(where $\frac{a}{b}<\frac{m}{n}<\frac{c}{d}$ ). note: sorry for asking multiple questions in one post (which I know some people frown on) but I feel posting multiple questions with the same 'introduction' (problem+proof) would clutter and be somewhat cumbersome.","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'inequality', 'fractions']"
2494843,"Surjective, but not Injective Linear map between C[0,1]","Given the Banach space $C[0,1]$={$f$:$[0,1]$$\longrightarrow$$\mathbb{C}$, continuous} equipped with sup norm, I would like to find a bounded linear operator $T$ : $C[0,1]$$\longrightarrow$$C[0,1]$ that is surjective but not injective. And all I can think of is a differential operator, but not all continuous functions are differentiable. So a differential operator wouldn't work unless the domain is restricted. I have come up with $T(f(x))=f(\frac{x}{2})-f(1-\frac{x}{2})$ T is not injective, but I am not convinced if T is even surjective. So any help would be appreciated. Thank you.","['banach-spaces', 'differential-operators', 'analysis']"
2494847,"Rigorous concise books that cover commonly taught mathematical topics since primary school up to ""calculus"" in high school","I'll be doing some tutoring and (to help myself with the presentation of the material) I need to find a rigorous and concise book (or books) about the topics that are commonly taught since primary school until the end of high school (right before starting the ""calculus"" sequences). Does such books exist? Can you provide some examples?","['reference-request', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'euclidean-geometry', 'soft-question']"
2494850,Markov chain on a graph,"Suppose $(X_0, X_1, X_2,...)$ is a Markov chain on a graph $G=(V,E)$ on which there is a distinguished node $v^* \in V$. The transition matrix $P$ is such that $P(x,y)>0$ iff $x$ and $y$ are neighbours, i.e. if $x \sim y$ and we also assume that for every $x\in V$, $x \sim x$ and consequently $P(x,x)>0$. Moreover, for a node $x\in V$,  $P(x,y) = p >1/2$ for the node $y$ such that $d(y,v^*)<d(x,v^*)$ (or one of those nodes, if there are multiple) and $P(x,z) \sim 1-p$ for all other neighbors of $x$. How can we prove that the invariant measure $\pi$ puts maximum mass on $v^*$, i.e. that $\pi(v^*)>\pi(v) \forall v\in V\setminus\{v^*\}$ ?","['random-walk', 'markov-chains', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
2494860,Evaluation Map of invertible Sheaves Isomorphism,"Let $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ ringed space, $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}$ invertible sheaves on $X$ and $\underline{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}) $ the $Hom$ - sheaf. There is always given the canonical evaluation map $\mathcal{F} \otimes \underline{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}) \to \mathcal{G}$.

2494886,Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$,"Let $l$ be the Lebesgue measure on $ \sigma$-algebra $L$ of Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and $A\in L$ with $l(A)>0$. How do I prove that for a $0<\epsilon<1$ there exists an open $U$ such that
  $$ l(A\cap U)>\epsilon\cdot l(U) ?$$ What I have tried: I know that the Lebesgue measure is given by
$$l(X)=\sup\{l(C):C\subset X,C\text{ compact}\}$$
or
$$l(X)=\inf\{l(O):X\subset O,O\text{ open}\}$$
Thus I can find an open $O$ with $A\subset O$ and $l(A)>l(O)-\delta$ for any $\delta$. Taking $\delta=l(A)(1/\epsilon-1)$, we then get $l(A)>\epsilon\cdot l(O)$. How do I continue from here?","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"
2494899,Function is Continuous When Restricted to Closed Sets Which Cover the Space,"Suppose that $\{A_i\}$ is a finite collection of closed sets in $X$ such that $X = \bigcup A_i$, and $f : X \to Y$ restricted to each $A_i$ is continuous. Then $f$ is continuous. Okay. The base case ($n=2$) is just the pasting lemma. I am having a little trouble with the inductive case, specifically with what the hypothesis is and how to deal with continuity with respect to subspaces. I believe the inductive hypothesis is to assume that any function over a topological space that is the union of $n-1$ closed sets such that the function restricted to each of these $n-1$ closed set is continuous must be continuous over the whole space. Then I assume I have a topological space $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$, where each $A_i$ is closed, and a function $f : X \to Y$ such that $f|_{A_i}$ is continuous for each $i$. Thus $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i \cup A_n$, where $C = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i$ is closed since it is a finite union of closed sets. If I can show $f|_C$ is continuous, then I simply apply the pasting lemma to finish the problem. Give $C$ the subspace topology, and notice that each $A_i$ is closed in $C$. Thus we have a topological space $C$ that is the union of $n-1$ closed. But do I still have continuity $f$ restricted to $A_i$ since I am no longer considering them subspaces of $X$ but of $C$? When one says $f|_{A_i}$ is continuous, is one saying that $f$ is continuous when restricted to $A_i$ and $A_i$ is given the subspace topology? EDIT: I think I figured out the lemma I need. Claim: Let $A$ and $C$ be subspaces of $X$ such that $A \subseteq C$. Topologize $C$ with subspace topology with respect to $X$. Then the subspace topology on $A$ as a subspace of $X$ (call it $\tau_X$) is the same as the subspace topology of $A$ as a subspace of $C$ (call it $\tau_C$). Proof: Let $U$ be open in $X$. Then $A \cap U$ is some open set in $A$ as a subspace of $X$. Since $C$ is a subspace of $X$, $C \cap U$ is open in $C$ as a subspace of $X$. Then $A \cap (C \cap U) = (A \cap C) \cap U = A \cap U$ is open in $A$ as a subspace of $C$, thereby proving $\tau_X \subseteq \tau_C$. Now let $O$ be some open set in $C$ as a subspace of $X$. Then $A \cap O$ is some open subset of $A$ as a subspace of $C$. But $O = C \cap U$ for some open set in $X$. Therefore $A \cap O = A \cap (C \cap U)= A \cap U$, which is also open in $A$ as a subspace of $X$. Hence $\tau_C \subseteq \tau_X$ Kind of obvious. But it was hard to spot the need for this lemma when I was considering subspace of subspaces and continuous functions, etc. Am I right in thinking this is the lemma I need?","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'solution-verification']"
2494905,Is $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1}$ if $x_1=y_1$?,"Let $M$ be a manifold, $p\in M$ and $(U,\varphi=(x_1,\dots,x_n))$, $(V,\psi=(y_1,\dots,y_n))$ two local charts such that $p\in U\cap V$ and $x_1=y_1$. Is it true that $(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1})_p=(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1})_p$? My professor says that the answer is yes, and so I build a proof. But then I found the following counterexample: Let $M=\mathbb{R}^2$, $p=(0,0)$, $U=V=\mathbb{R}^2$, $\varphi(u,v)=(u,v)$ and $\psi(u,v)=(u,u+v)$. Then $x_1(y_1,y_2)=y_1$ and $x_2(y_1,y_2)=y_2-y_1$. Using the formula for the change of basis I've got $$(\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1})_p=\sum_{i=1}^2(\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_1})_p(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i})_p=(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2})_p-(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1})_p\neq (\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1})_p$$ What's wrong with this counterexample?","['manifolds', 'vector-fields', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
