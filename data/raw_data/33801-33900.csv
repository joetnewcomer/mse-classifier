321812,Generalizing monotonicity to 2D,"Monotone functions of a single variable are well defined, they just keep increasing when the variable increases (or decreases). I wonder if this concept has a standard generalization to two dimensions. Obviously, if any function is observed by following an arbitrary path in the XY plane, it can go increasing or decreasing or both. On the other hand, simple functions like affine (a X + b Y + c) or a paraboloid in the first quadrant (f=X^2+Y2, X, Y > 0) are intuitively 2D monotonic. Is there a way to formalize 2D monotonicity ? Are there monotone surfaces ?",['functions']

321860,Show that $z^3 + (1+i)z - 3 + i = 0$ does not have any roots in the unit circle $|z|\leq 1$.,I need help with showing that $z^3 + (1+i)z - 3 + i = 0$ does not have any roots in the unit circle $|z|\leq 1$?

321886,Integral Closures and Affine Curves,"Let $C$ be an irreducible affine curve with singular points, and let $A$ be its ring of regular functions.  Since $C$ has singular points, $A$ is not integrally closed in its field of fractions, $K$.  I'd like to compute $\overline{A}^K$, the integral closure of $A$ in $K$ by resolving the singularities of $C$. Suppose by blowing up the singularities of $C$ I obtain a non-singular curve $C'$ which happens to be affine itself, and a map $C'\twoheadrightarrow C$ of varieties.  This induces an injection $A\hookrightarrow A'$, where $A'$ is the ring of regular functions of $C'$.  Since $C'$ is non-singular, $A'$ is integrally closed, and I suspect is isomorphic to $\overline{A}^K$.  To verify my suspicion, I would need to show that all elements of $A'$ are integral over $A$. Can someone help me see why this is true or not true?  I understand that one implication of my suspicion is that if a birational equivalence class of curves has a non-singular affine curve, then it is unique up to isomorphism, but this doesn't seem so hard to believe.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

321938,Closed and bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is sequentially compact,"I want to prove that any closed and bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is sequentially compact. Note that I want to prove this without using the Heine-Borel theorem and the equivalence of sequential compactness and compactness. Ah and I can use that any closed and bounded set in $\mathbb{R}$ is sequentially compact. The way I did it is as follows: Let $S$ be a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $\exists a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $S \subseteq [a,b]\times [a,b] \times ...[a,b]$. 
Now I will consider a sequence in $S$. Let $x_p = (x_p^1, x_p^2,...,x_p^n) \forall p \in  \mathbb{N}$. Then I will construct $n$ sequences of components of $x_p$.
Let $x^{(i)}=x_1^i,x_2^i...$ 
Then $x^{(1)}\subset [a,b]$, and $[a,b]$ is sequentially compact. so  $x^{(1)}$ has a convergent subsequence.
Now if we denote the indices of this sequence by $t_1,t_2...$ we know that $x^1_{t_1},x^1_{t_2}, x^1_{t_3}...$ converges to some $x$ in $[a,b]$.
Now if we consider  $x^2_{t_1},x^2_{t_2}, x^2_{t_3}...$ it is a sequence in $[a,b]$ a sequentially compact space. So it has a convergent subsequence. Again we take the indices of this subsequence and we consider them to build a subsequence of $x_3$ which converges. After we have repeated this procedure $n$ times we are left with $n$ we have found a set of indices $f_1,f_2...$ such that $x^n_{f_1}, x^n_{f_2}...$ converges. But then by construction $x^p_{f_1}, x^p_{f_2}...$ converges $\forall  p \in1..n$ as it is a subsequence of a convergent sequence. Then $x_{f_1},x_{f_2} ..$ converges (as it is a sequence in  $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which all individual components converge) and as it is included in a closed set, the limit of the sequence is part of the set. Since we started with an arbitrary sequence, this proves that any closed and bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is sequentially compact. Can you please have a look at this and tell me if something is wrong? It seems fine to me, but I really want to get the concept behind sequential compactness. I know that historically it was the first definition of compactness, so I find it important to see how knowledge evolved and how people initially proved it, without using compactness. Also, please feel free to show me another proof, I am very interested in that as well. Thank you!",['general-topology']
321945,"X has pdf $f(x) = \frac{x^{2}}{18}$ for -3<x<3, what is the pdf of $X^{2}$","So this was my solution: Say, $Z = X^{2}$, then $X=\pm \sqrt{Z}$ and, $$P(Z=z)=P(X = \sqrt{z}) + P(X = -\sqrt{z}) = \frac{z}{18} + \frac{z}{18} = \frac{z}{9}$$ for $$0<z<9$$ However: $$\int_{0}^{9}P(z) dz = \int_{0}^{9}\frac{z}{9}dz = \frac{9}{2} \neq 1$$ Where did I go wrong?

I'm doing some reading on modeling Supply and Demand from economics using a second order differential equation ( http://espin086.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/the-second-order-differential-equations-of-dynamic-market-equilibrium/ ). It's been a while since I've studied this (the DE part) and I have some questions. This article describes their solution to a differential equation that models price as having 3 solutions: A distinct real solution A repeating real solution, and A complex conjugate. I presume that if one wanted to use the solutions to the differential equations and calculate expected prices, one would use the distinct real solution. What's tripping me up though is the repeating real solution. Having plotted it (using graphsketch.com), I don't really see a repeating component in what they describe ($e^{-x}+x*e^{-x}$ is a generalization of the solution). Logically I don't understand how this fits in to a supply and demand context. Is it something that can be outright ignored? It is a solution after all so that would lead me to day no. The complex conjugate I presume can be discarded entirely since you can't have imaginary money. I remember from my electrical engineering days that imaginary components were very important in calculating magnitudes and this is adding to the confusion. Any help is appreciated.

So I'm quite surprised that it's not addressed in any book about Morse theory that I've seen so far. To eliminate any misunderstanding I will recall the definition of gradient-like vector fields: Definition: A vector field $X\in$Vect$(M)$ is called gradient-like for $f$ if 1.  $\forall q\in M\setminus Crit(f):\; df(q)X(q)<0$. 2. For each critical point $p\in Crit(f)$ of $f$, $\exists$ Morse coordinate chart $\phi:U\to\mathbb{R^n}$ (i.e. $\phi(p)=0$ and $f\circ\phi^{-1}(x)=f(p)-\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2+\sum_{i=k+1}^n x_i^2$ for $x\in\phi(U)$, $k=index(p)$) such that $$\phi_*X(x)=d\phi(\phi^{-1}(x))X(\phi^{-1}(x))=(2x_1,\ldots,2x_k,-2x_{k+1},\ldots,-2x_n)^T$$  for $x\in\phi(U)$ (i.e. in this Morse-chart $X$ coincides with the negative gradient of $f$ w.r.t. the euclidean metric on  $\mathbb{R^n}$). Some motivation: I'm interested whether the space of all gradient-like vector fields for $f$ is contractible. If the answer to my question is affirmative then clearly any convex combination of a gradient-like vector field is still gradient-like and hence the space of gradient-like vector fields is contractible. Any relevant references are also much appreciated. Thanks for any contribution.

In some specific cases, a parameter could be incorporated into the function name, like $y$ in $$\log_y (x)$$ But is there any more or less standard notation for parameters? What I've found so far is that in probability theory very often parameters are delimited from variables with semicolon, i.e. $f(x; y)$. However I have some objects which are not functions but they parametrically depends on some other objects and it is impossible to show such dependence with this notation. Alternative approach (found in some physics books) is to enclose parameters in the arguments list in curly brackets, i.e. $f(x, \{y\})$. Then if some object which is not a function but depends on some parameter can be denoted as $O(\{y\})$. But this notation is confusing since $\{ \}$ are used quite frequently for sets.

322411,"Topological characterization of the closed interval $[0, 1]$.","I would like to learn purely topological characterizations of the closed real intervals (to justify the existence of algebraic topology). In particular, such a characterization should not use real numbers. I would like to see in what sense $[0, 1]$ is topologically more important than, for example, the set of rationals, or the complex unit disc. I am especially interested in why the unit interval is so important in the study of compact Hausdorff spaces (metrization, Urysohn's lemma). I have come up with the following one. Start with a definition of path connectedness that does not use $\mathbb R$: $x_1$ and $x_2$ are connected by a path in $X$ if for every Hausdorff compact $C$ and $a,b\in C$, there is a continuous $f\colon C\to X$ such that $f(a)=x_1$ and $f(b)=x_2$.  Now, if $X$ is a Hausdorff space and distinct points $x_1$ and $x_2$ are connected by a path in $X$, then there is a minimal subspace of $X$ in which $x_1$ and $x_2$ are still connected by a path, and every such subspace is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]$. Roughly speaking, $([0, 1], 0, 1)$ is the minimal bi-pointed Hausdorff space such that every bi-pointed Hausdorff compact can be mapped into it with the distinguished points being sent onto the distinguished points. Maybe in some sense it can be also said that $X = [0, 1]$ is the ""minimal"" Hausdorff space such that every Hausdorff compact embeds into $X^N$ for some $N$, but i do not know how to make this precise.

Show that every reduced finitely - generated $k$ - algebra $R$ is such that given any prime ideal $Q \subseteq R$, we have
    $$Q = \bigcap P$$
    where the intersection runs over all primes $P$ of $R$ such that $R/P$ is finite as a module over $k$. We note that this consequently sows that such an $R$ is a Jacobson ring. The definition of a Jacobson ring given in Eisenbud is that every prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. Necessarily, we need each of these $P$ to contain $Q$ so that $Q \subseteq P$. Now Eisenbud gives a hint for the reverse inclusion: Hint: If $f \in R$ and $f \notin Q$, we must find a prime $P$ such that $R/P$ is finite over $k$ and $f \notin P$. Consider a maximal ideal in the $k$ - algebra $R_f$ and its intersection with $R$. Now I kinda get the hint of Eisenbud: If we choose a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in $R_{f}$, then the ""contraction"" of that maximal ideal in $R$ is prime. Since we have ""inclusions"" $$k \hookrightarrow R/(\mathfrak{m} \cap R) \hookrightarrow R_f/\mathfrak{m}$$ and $R_f/\mathfrak{m}$ is finite as a module over $k$, then necessarily so is $R/(\mathfrak{m} \cap R)$ because $k$ is Noetherian. My problem is: We are not guaranteed that the ring homomorphism $R \to R_f$ that maps $x$ to $x/1$ is injective. So how can we embed $R$ inside of $R_f$ so that it makes sense to take the intersection of $\mathfrak{m}$ with $R$? Thanks.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

I think there is a flow somewhere in my logic. Can you help me to understand this concept? Thanks. Update: for anyone interested, the question originally emerged during the discussion of Hindsight bias phenomenon . More precisely, the result of Fischhoff and Beyth experiment seems to be logically correct since differences in the results of predictions were caused by the differences in the information given to the groups. Even if the students were explicitly asked not to consider the result of conflicts as the probability factor, the only thing that experiment states is that we can't throw things out from our subconscious perception of the world at will (and that is obvious from the definition of the subconsciousness itself).

Then there is a unique function $u\in C^{2}(B)\cap C(\overline{B})$, satisfying $\Delta u=f$ in $B$ and $u=0$ on $\partial B$. Furthermore $u$ satisfies an estimate:
\begin{equation}
\sup_{x\in B} \ \text{dist}(x, \partial B)^{-\beta}\vert u(x)\vert\leq CN,
\end{equation}
where $C=C(\beta)$. I am following the proof of this theorem and I am happy with everything upto the point they start to prove the existence of $u$. To show the existence of $u$ they first let
\begin{equation}
f_m=\left\{\begin{aligned}
m &\quad\text{if } f\geq m\\
f &\quad\text{if }\vert f\vert\leq m\\
-m &\quad\text{if } f\leq -m\end{aligned}\right.
\end{equation} and let $\{B_k\}_{k=n}^{\infty}$, $n=\lceil \inf_{x\in B} \vert f\vert\rceil$, be a collection of concentric balls about $x_0$ such that:
\begin{equation}
B_k\subset\subset B_{k+1}, \quad x\in B_{k}\Rightarrow \vert f(x)\vert\leq k\quad\text{and} \quad \bigcup_k B_{k}=B.
\end{equation} With this setup they define the set $\{u_m\}$ to be the set of functions that satisfy:
\begin{align*}
\Delta u_m &=f_m\quad\text{in } B\\
u_m &=0\quad\text{on } \partial B.
\end{align*} By the estimate provided above (this was proved first in their argument) we know that $u_m$ is uniformly bounded and that for $m\geq k$
\begin{equation}
\Delta u_m=f\quad\text{in } B_k.
\end{equation} Now they say that if we apply Corollary 4.7 successively to the balls $B_k$ then we get a subsequence that converges to a function $u\in C^{2}(B)$ that satisfies $\Delta u=f$ in $B$. Corollary 4.7 says that if $u_n$ is a uniformly bounded sequence of solution to Poisson's equation, $\Delta u=f$ in a domain $\Omega$ with $f\in C^{\alpha}(\Omega)$ then for any $\Omega'\subset\subset \Omega$ there is a subsequence that converges uniformly to a solution. I tried to apply this Corollary 4.7 in this way, however, I find myself taking subsequences infinitely often as follows: If $B_k\subset\subset B_{k+1}$ then:
\begin{equation}
\Delta u_m=f\quad\text{in } B_{k+1}\ \forall m\geq k+1\Rightarrow \exists\  u_{m_j}\rightrightarrows u: \Delta u=f \ \text{in } B_{k}.
\end{equation} So certainly this subsequence converges to a $u\in C^{2}(B_k)$ that satisfies Poisson's equation in $B_{k}$ and if I repeat the process for $B_{k+1}\subset\subset B_{k+2}$ then I take a subsequence of $u_{m_j}$ to get the result for $B_{k+1}$ and so on. I don't understand how this process will stop such that I find one subsequence that works throughout $B$ as claimed by [G-T]. If we are to use Corollary 4.7 in this way then shouldn't we find ourselves stopping this procedure once $B$ becomes compactly contained in some bigger set in which Poisson's equation is satisfied by $u_m$?

I'm sorry for just copying the question without writing any development myself, I don't have a single ideia about how to use the definitions or the theorems given to solve this. I need the answer but more than that I need to understand the answer, slow explanations are very welcome ( I'm slow at this subject ). Let $k\subseteq F=k(\alpha)$ be a simple algebraic extension. Prove that $F$ is normal over $k$ if and only if for every algebraic extension $F\subseteq K$ and every $\sigma\in \rm{Aut \ }_k(K)$, $\sigma(F)=F$. $\rm{Aut \ }_k(K)$ is the group of automorphisms of $K$ fixing the field $k$.

322689,Solving a system of linear inequalities,"I have a personal problem I want to solve. I have a system of linear inequalities with 97 unknowns and 150000 ineqaulities, I think formal notation of the problem should be something like this \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{00000101}  & \cdots & x_{00000197}\\
        \vdots  & \ddots &\vdots\\
        x_{15000001} &  \cdots & x_{15000097}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_{97} \end{array} \right] =
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} z_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_{150000} \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\forall z \in \left\{ z_i | i \in [1,150000]\right\}, z_i > 0
\end{equation}
We also know that $\forall x \in $ leftmost matrix $x \in \left\{-1,0,1 \right\}$ (i.e coefficients can only take -1,0,1 as values) and there is exacly $5$ $1$s and $5$ $-1$'s in every row in leftmost matrix. So, each row sums up to $0$. What I want to do is to determine if I can order $y_i$'s and if so, I want to find an algorithm to order them. I am considering using a genetic algorithm and by trying arbitrary values for every $y_i$. But I guess that could be computationaly expensive. Is there a way I can deterministically solve this problem? Some background information: every $y_i$ represents a player in a game, I have a data of 150000 matches of 5 player vs 5 player. I am assuming team's ability to win is sum of the abilities of its players. So I am wondering if I can order the players to best to worse.","['linear-algebra', 'inequality']"

So, I try to prove via its space's properties (associatity, conmutativity, etc) and it works. Even preservation of scale. But when I try to prove for zero $(0\cdot v=0)$ It doesn't work for me, I mean $0\cdot(x, y) = (-1, 0)$ which is clearly not $(0,0)$ But book's answer is: it is an space, so I must be wrong. Now, thinking about it, I'm starting to believe that zero vector of vector spaces isn't necessary $(0,0,\dots,0)$. And then for this example $(-1,0)$ is the zero of the space, and it can be found taking any space element and doing $x - x$ ($x$ minus itself). Am I right? Or am I omitting something more obvious.

322851,"On the precise asymptotic scaling of $n!/(n-k)!$ as $n,k \to \infty$","On page 23 of [ Erdős+Rényi 1960, ""On the evolution of random graphs"" ], the following asymptotic formula is stated without proof:
$$ \binom{n}{k} \sim \frac{n^k \mathrm e^{-\frac{k^2}{2n} - \frac{k^3}{6n^2}}}{k!} $$
valid for $k \in o(n^{\text{[some illegible fraction]}})$. That is, we have 
$$ \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \;=\; n^k \exp\left(-\tfrac{k^2}{2n} - \tfrac{k^3}{6n^2}\right) \cdot \Bigl[1 \pm o(1)\Bigr].$$
I was curious about what the limitations of the illegible upper bound on $k$ were for this approximation, and hoped that I could use at least some useful scaling for $k \in \Theta(n^{2/3})$, so I tried to rederive it. However, using Stirling's approximation for the factorial,
$$ n! = n^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm e^{-n}\cdot \Bigl[\sqrt{2\pi} + o(1)\Bigr], $$
the best that I could rederive was the following:
$$\begin{align}
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\;&=\;
\frac{n^{n-k+\frac{1}{2}} n^k \mathrm e^{n-k}}{(n-k)^{n - k + \frac{1}{2}} \mathrm e^n} \cdot \Bigl[1 \pm o(1)\Bigr]
\\&=\;
n^k \left(1 - \frac{k}{n}\right)^{-n+k-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-k} \cdot \Bigl[1 \pm o(1)\Bigr]\end{align}$$
which looks as though it should scale like
$$ \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \;\;\stackrel{\;?\,}\sim\;\; n^k \exp\Bigl( - \tfrac{k^2}{n} + \tfrac{k}{2n} \Bigr),$$ for all $k \in o(n)$. This is close, but no cigar. Is there anything that I'm missing?","['asymptotics', 'permutations', 'combinatorics']"
