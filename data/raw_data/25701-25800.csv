233861,"Convergence in probability, not almost surely","This is a classic example of convergence in probability, but not almost surely, but I am trying to rigorously prove it as opposed to ""arguing against"" the almost sure convergence. 
$\DeclareMathOperator{\Pb}{\mathbf{P}}$ $\DeclareMathOperator{\Unif}{\mathsf{Uniform}}$ Definition 1 A sequence of random variables, $X_n$, is said to converge in probability if for any real number $\epsilon > 0$ $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pb(|X_n - X | > \epsilon ) \to 0$$ Definition 2 A sequence of random variables $X_n$, is said to converge almost surely (a.s.) to a limit if $$\Pb(\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = X) = 1$$ Recall also that a sequence of real numbers $a_n$ converges to a limit $a$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a large enough value $N$ so that $|a_n - a| < \epsilon $ for all $n \geq N$. In other words, the difference between the sequence and the limit is uniformly small after some point in the sequence. The Question Let $U \sim \Unif(0,1)$. For $n = 2^k + m$ where $k \geq 0$ and $0 \leq m \leq 2^k - 1$ define the functions $f_n : [0, 1) \to \{0,1\}$ as follows
$$
f_n(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } {m \over 2^k} \leq x < {m +1 \over 2^k} \\ 0 & \text{o.w.}
\end{cases} $$ What is the distribution of $f_n(U)$ for $n = 2^k + m$ for $k \geq 0$ and $ 0 \leq m \leq 2^k - 1$? Using the previous part, show that $X_n := f_n(U)$ converges to $0$ in probability. Show that for any fixed $x \in (0,1)$, $f_n(x) = 1$ for infinitely many values of $n$. Use this fact to reason why $X_n = f_n(U)$ does not converge to 0 almost surely. My Work $f_n(U)$ is equal to $1$ with probability ${1 \over 2^k}$ and $0$ otherwise. This takes care of the distribution, then to show that $X_n$ does not converge in probability, $$\Pb(|X_n - 0| > \epsilon) = \Pb(X_n = 1) = {1 \over 2^k}$$ As $n \to \infty$, for $k = \lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor $ we have that $k \to \infty$, hence $${1 \over 2^k} = \Pb(|X_n - 0| > \epsilon) \to 0$$ This is the part that I have often seen slightly glossed over. It is also the part that I am unclear about. I want to fix an $x$, and show that there is an $N$ so that $X_n$ for all $n \geq N$ is uniformly close to $0$. However, I'm really not sure how to do this. I tried working with binary expansions of my fixed $x$. Thanks for any help.","['probability-theory', 'real-analysis']"

My Answer: Let ${f_n}$ be a sequence of integrable functions such that $f_n \to f$ on E and f is integrable over E. Let $\int_E |f_n - f| \to 0$, then $\left|\int_E |f_n| - \int_E |f| \right|$ $\leq$ $\left|\int_E|f_n| - |f|\right|$ $\leq$ $\int_E |f_n - f| \to 0$. Does this imply what we are trying to prove?

233971,"A contradictory integral: $\int \sin x \cos x \, \mathrm dx$","I've been thinking about integration lately, and I've come up with a question that I'm not sure how to address. Consider $$
\int \sin x\cos x \, \mathrm dx = - \int -\sin x \cos x \, \mathrm dx
$$ I started with the integral on the left hand side, which suggests a typical $u$ -substitution. Let $u=\sin x$ then $\, \mathrm du=\cos x \, \mathrm dx$ . So the integral evaluates to $$
\int \sin x\cos x \, \mathrm dx = \frac{\sin^2(x)}{2}
$$ But the original integral also suggests an alternate substitution. Let $u=\cos x$ and then $du=-\sin x \, dx$ . So now $$
\int \sin x\cos x \, \mathrm dx =- \int -\sin x \cos x \, \mathrm dx= -\frac{\cos^2(x)}{2}

I have seen counterexamples (e.g. the one given on Wikipedia ) of functions which have partials defined everywhere, but fail to be differentiable at some point.

234102,Group theoretic lemma about the extension of homomorphisms of profinite groups,"I have a question about a group-theoretic lemma proven in Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups by Tamas Szamuely. Suppose we have a profinite group $\Gamma$, a closed normal subgroup $N \subset \Gamma$ and a finite group $G$. Let $n \in N, \sigma \in \Gamma, g \in G$ . We have a left action on $Hom(N,G)$ (the set of continuous homomorphisms $N \rightarrow G$) of $G$ by conjugation, i.e. $g \cdot \phi(n) = g \phi(n) g^{-1}$ and a right action of $\Gamma$ by $(\phi \cdot \sigma)(n) = \phi(\sigma n \sigma^{-1})$. This two actions commute, $g \cdot (\phi\cdot \sigma) = (g \cdot \phi) \cdot \sigma$. Now, in this book there's a lemma saying that if $S \subset Hom(N,G)$ is stable under the actions of $G$ and $\Gamma$ and $G$ acts freely and transitively on $S$, then every $\phi\in S$ extends to a continuous homomorphism $\widehat{\phi}:\Gamma \rightarrow G$. The author proves this by making a homomorphism by noting that $\forall \sigma \in \Gamma$ there exists a unique $g_\sigma \in G$ such that $\phi(\sigma n \sigma^{-1}) = g_\sigma \phi(n) g_{\sigma^{-1}}$ due to the fact that $S$ is stable under $G$ and $G$ acts freely and transitively on $S$. Naturally he puts $\widehat{\phi}(\sigma) = g_\sigma$ and he proves that this is a continuous extension of $\phi$. Now, I understand that it's an extension of $\phi$, but I don't understand why it's continuous. The author claims that it's enough to prove that $\ker(\widehat{\phi})$ is open (which I understand). He then goes on saying that $\ker(\widehat{\phi})$ consists of those $\sigma \in \Gamma$ that fix $\phi$ (which I also understand), but then he says that this is open due to the continuity of $\phi$. Why is that ? Any help would be appreciated. Edit: I know that if I can prove that the right action of $\Gamma$ on $Hom(N,G)$ (with the discrete topology) is continuous, the continuity of $\widehat{\phi}$ follows since $ker(\widehat{\phi}) = Stab(\phi)$ and this is open iff the action of $\Gamma$ is continuous.

(a) Orthogonality relations: The characters $\chi_i$ are orthonormal. In other words $\langle\chi_i,\chi_j\rangle=0$ if $i\ne j$, and $\langle\chi_i,\chi_i\rangle=1$ for each $i$. (b) There are finitely many isomorphism classes of irreducible representations, the same number as the number of conjugacy classes in the group. (c) Let $d_i$ be the dimension of the irreducible representation $\rho_i$, let $r$ be the number of irreducible representations. Then $d_i$ divides $N$ and 
  $$N=d_1^2+\dots+d_r^2.$$ This theorem will be proved in Section 9, with the exception of the assertion that $d_i$ divides $N$, which we will not prove.

A group of nilpotency class $2$ has essentially only one ""twist"" in its structure, and a group sufficiently far from being abelian cannot be completely unraveled by commutators without using bigger guns.

234775,troubles proving every subset of a finite set is finite with naive set theory,"In a first undergraduate course in analysis, they have established a model of the natural numbers (without zero), proof by induction, recursive definition, injectivity, surjectivity, bijectivity of maps and elementary properties and the following definitions and facts: for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $A_m := \{k \in \mathbb{N};\ 1 \leq k \leq m\}$, two sets $M$ and $N$ are equipotent if there is a bijection $f \colon M \to N$, written $M \sim N$, a set $M$ is finite if it is empty or equipotent to $A_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $\forall m, n \in \mathbb{N}\colon A_m \sim A_n \Leftrightarrow m = n$, the cardinality of a finite nonempty set $M$ is $\#M = m$, where $M \sim A_m$, and every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a minimal element. Now they have to prove that a subset of a nonempty finite set is again finite. I have to present a solution to them.
It's clear that one can restrict this problem to: For $m \in \mathbb{N}$ if $T \subseteq A_m$, then there is a $n \in \mathbb{N},\ n \leq m: T \sim A_n$. I tried to define $T_1 = T$ and for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ $T_{k+1} := T_k \setminus \{\min T_k\}$ if $T_k \neq \emptyset$ and $T_{k+1} := \emptyset$ if $T_k = \emptyset$. Now I want to prove that there is a $n \in \mathbb{N} \colon T_{n+1} = \emptyset$. This would make $A_n \to T, k \mapsto \min T_k$ a bijection. How can I proceed? I thought maybe one can use induction on the cardinality of the $T_k$, but I don't see it immediately and I have little time. One can try to show that for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $T_k$ is finite and if $T_k \neq \emptyset$, then $\# T_{k+1} + 1 = \#T_k$, but then what?","['induction', 'elementary-set-theory']"

We start with a ""sound wave"" that is ""noisy"" at the prime numbers and silent at other numbers; this is the von Mangoldt function. Then we analyze its notes or frequencies by subjecting it to a process akin to Fourier transform; this is the Mellin transform. Then we prove, and this is the hard part, that certain ""notes"" cannot occur in this music. This exclusion of certain notes leads to the statement of the prime number theorem.

Now $p^2$ is taken to be divisible by 3 and thus an odd number, $p$ is also odd because any odd number squared is also odd. So let $p=3s$ where s is an integer. Then $3q^2=(3s)^2 = 3q^2=9s^2$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 leaves us with $q^2=3s^2$. Here is is taken that $q^2$ is divisible by 3 and is odd and so is $q$.

I am supposed to teach myself the content ""Sheaves, Cohomology and the de Rham Theorem"" using Warner's Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups. I have an issue with a very early supposedly easy problem and this suggest that I do not get any grip on the objects I am dealing with. Could somebody maybe give me a hint or a point of view which stays in Warner's framework (no ringed spaces a.s.o.)? Before I delve into the questions, I fix a bit of vocabulary (as this might vary from author to author): $M$ is a manifold $K$ is a principal ideal domain A sheaf $\mathcal{S}$ of $K$-modules over $M$ is a tuple $(\mathcal{S},\pi)$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is a topological space and $\pi:\mathcal{S}\to M$ is a local homeomorphism such that for all $m\in M$ the preimage $\pi^{-1}(m)$ is a $K$-module and the composition laws (on the modules in) $\mathcal{S}$ are continuous. Now for the question:
Let $(\mathcal{S},\pi)$ be a sheaf of $K$-modules over a manifold $M$. Let $U\subset M$ open and $f:U\to\mathcal{S}$ be a section of $\mathcal{S}$ over $U$, i.e. $f$ is continuous and $\pi\circ f=\operatorname{id}_{U}$. Assume $m\in U$ such that $f(m)=0$ in $\pi^{-1}(m)$. Then there exists a neighbourhood $m\in V\subset U$ such that $f$ vanishes on all of $V$, i.e. $f(v)=0\in\pi^{-1}(v)$. I assume that this must be true as of the following: ""[...] if sections $f$ and $g$ agree at $m\in M$, then they must agree on a neighbourhood of $m$"". As I had no idea how to answer this question, I decided to first work on the first problem in the exercise section, i.e. that the null-section $g:M\to\mathcal{S}$ defined by $g(m)=0\in\pi^{-1}(m)$ is continuous. I haven't even managed to prove this. That's why I am asking for help. I have tried to prove it pretty directly, i.e. I chose a neighbourhood $g(m)=0\in W\subseteq\mathcal{S}$ such that $\pi\big|_{W}$ is a homeomorphism and then started looking for a neigbourhood $m\in U\subseteq M$ which satisfies $g(U)\subseteq W$. I used some neighbourhood $m\in V\subseteq\pi(W)$ and $\pi\circ g\big|_{V}=\operatorname{id}_{V}$ to deduce that $g(V)\subseteq \pi^{-1}(\pi(W))$. The latter simply is:
$$
\pi^{-1}(\pi(W))=\bigcup_{w\in W}(\{0\}\cup\pi^{-1}(\pi(w))\setminus\{0\})
$$

235089,Continuous partials at a point without being defined throughout a neighborhood and not differentiable there?,"This is a follow-up to Continuous partials at a point but not differentiable there? , but I'll make this question self-contained. Throughout, $f$ will denote a function $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$. An answer to Equivalent condition for differentiability on partial derivatives cites a theorem implying ""If $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist at $P$ and $f_x$ is defined throughout a neighborhood of $P$ and $f_x$ is continuous at $P$, then $f$ is differentiable at $P$."", which is stronger than what you find in many calculus texts. First note that this can't possibly be weakened to something like ""exists in almost all of a neighborhood and is continuous along paths within that neighborhood of all but one limiting direction"". One counterexample would be $f(x,y)=\sqrt[3]{xy}$, which has partials that both exist at the origin and only blow up along some axis (with the origin deleted) so that limits of a partial along paths whose limiting direction is not the direction of the problem-axis all exist and agree. But $f$ is not differentiable at the origin. I wonder ""is the fact that the partials blow up the problem?"" Or is mere non-existence of the partials arbitrarily close to the point enough to give the function a chance to be non-differentiable? More formally... My question: Is there a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist at $P$. $f_x$ is defined in a neighborhood of $P$ minus an open ray (or a line with $P$ deleted, if it makes things easier). $f_x$ is continuous at $P$ in the sense that for all $Q$ in the domain of $f_x$ and for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ so that $\Vert P-Q\Vert<\delta\Rightarrow\Vert f_x(Q)-f_x(P)\Vert<\varepsilon$. $f$ is not differentiable at $P$. It may be the case that the answer is ""no, because no function satisfies 1. through 3. without $f_x$ being defined in a neighborhood of $P$ so that 4. is impossible by the theorem in Apostol's book"", but even if that's the case, I'd like to know. The reason I worry about that possibility is that I know that in the 1-d case a derivative can't have jump discontinuities, and this seems like a similar issue (something reminiscent of branch cuts). Additionally, naive functions built out of $x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ tend to be differentiable.","['multivariable-calculus', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
