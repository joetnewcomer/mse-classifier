1534317,Area of a plane triangle as limit of a spherical triangle,"We know that the area of an spherical triangle (in a unit sphere) is given by
$A(\triangle) = \alpha + \beta + \gamma - \pi$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$ are the interior angles of the spherical triangle. I would like to see how plane (Euclidean) geometry works as a limit when the radius of the sphere goes to infinity. Clearly the curvature of the sphere $1/r$ becomes zero and a sphere turns into a plane. What happens to the area of the triangle? If we say that the area of the triangle is 
\begin{equation}
  A(\triangle) = r^2 [(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) - \pi]
\end{equation}
clearly $\alpha + \beta + \gamma - \pi$ go to zero, but not
at the rate that $r^2$ goes to infinity. It seems that this limit
is infinity. There seems to me that we can not find something like $b h/2$ (base times height over two) from spherical geometry. Right? Of course objects become amplified in area by $r^2$ or length by $r$
so we would need to have something to pull them back. Thanks. Update: One way to pull back is to think that the actual arc lengths of the
stretched triangle segments are $a=r \alpha$, $b=r \beta$, and
$c= r \gamma$, so we can pull one $r$ inside the formula above and have \begin{equation}
  A(\triangle) = r [(a+b+c) - \pi r]
\end{equation} where now $a,b$, and $c$ are the actual lengths of the sides. 
Pulling $r$ inside again shows me the area of a circle and...
it seems that we better point toward Heron's formula and forget about base x height/2. Heron's formula is fine to me.","['spherical-geometry', 'geometry']"

1534440,Why are there limits which do not exist?,"The limit of a real function can be of one of three types. A real limit would be a limit where the value is a real number:
$$\lim_{x\to0}x^2=0$$
An infinite limit would be a limit where the value is equal to $\pm\infty$:
$$\lim_{x\to-\infty}{1\over e^x}=\infty$$
And an undefined/non-existing limit would be one where it is not possible to assign a value of any kind to the limit:
$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\sin x$$ My question is, what other undefined limits are out there? I understand that $\lim_{x\to\infty}\sin x$ is undefined because $\sin x$ is a periodic function whose value is in $[-1,1]$, and we can't find which, if any, single value in that interval it will achieve as $x$ tends to infinity. I also know I could get a similar undefined limit using any other trigonometric function. Are there any other limits composed of elementary functions which are undefined?  Are such undefined limits something exclusive to periodic functions or can they be constructed using other kinds of functions?","['limits', 'real-analysis']"

However, if I'm given subspaces $U, V \subset H$, then is there any assumption (not directly assuming that $U = V$) I can make that guarantees the existence of unitary operator $T:H\to H$ such that the restriction $$T\restriction_U:U\to V$$ is a surjective isometry?

1534467,Goldbach for certain classes of $n$,"The Wiki article on the Goldbach conjecture (where $\#$ of ways even $n$ can be represented by prime additions is heareafter denoted $G(n)$) states that In 1975, Hugh Montgomery and Robert Charles Vaughan showed that ""most"" even numbers were expressible as the sum of two primes. More precisely, they showed that there exist positive constants $c$ and $C$ such that for all sufficiently large numbers N, every even number less than N is the sum of two primes, with at most $C N^{1-c}$ exceptions. In particular, the set of even integers which are not the sum of two primes has density zero. Has the Goldbach conjecture been proven for any specific classes on $n$? By exhautive search,it has been proven for $4\leq n \leq 10^{18},$ but my question is whether it has been proven for eg primorial multiples, where $G(n)$ generally reaches it's maximum. Surely it is not difficult to prove for the primorials, or am I mistaken as to the sheer complexity of the task? Reposted to MO here","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory', 'goldbachs-conjecture']"

But from here could someone help by maybe giving some advice for simplifying or improving on this or perhaps provide another direction that I could take with this?

1534557,Group of Order 105 Having Normal Sylow 5/7 Subgroups,"I am trying to prove that, given $|G|=105$, the G has a normal Sylow 5 subgroup and a normal Sylow 7 subgroup. I think the thing that is confusing me is the word ""and"".  It would seem that there can't be both a normal subgroup of order 5 and 7, i think.  If there were, since their intersection is just $e_G$, then this ties up the remaining 94 elements in a bunch of Sylow 3 subgroups.  Again, because they each contain $e_G$, there needs to be 47 Sylow 3 subgroups, which is impossible by the conditions on the Sylow theorems; So where is my thinking off?  Does it really mean ""or""? There has to be at least one normal 5 or 7, since if neither were normal, because $n_5=21$ and $n_7=15$, and since $4(21)+6(15)>105$, we have a contradiction with the number of elements.

1534622,Monotone increasing function can be expressed as sum of absolutely continuous function and singular function,"I'm working on a problem from Royden's Real Analysis: Show that if a function $f$ is monotone increasing on $[a,b]$ , then $f$ can be represented as the sum of an absolutely continuous function and a singular function. I understand the general idea of the proof (I think), but there are a few details I'm unclear on. Here's my proof so far: Let $f$ be monotone increasing on $[a,b]$ . Let $g(x) = \int_a^x f'(t) dt + g(a)$ . Since $g$ is an indefinite integral, $g$ is absolutely continuous. Let $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ . Then $h'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x)$ . Since $f$ is monotone increasing, by Theorem 5.3 $\ f'$ is measurable. Then, by Lemma 5.9 $g'(x) = f'(x)$ almost everywhere, so $h'(x) = 0$ almost everywhere, and $h$ is thus singular. $\textbf{Theorem 5.3:}$ If $f$ is monotone increasing on $[a,b]$ ,
    then $f$ is differentiable a.e. and $f'$ is measurable. $\textbf{Theorem 5.9:}$ If $f$ is bounded and measurable on $[a,b]$ , 
    and $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt + F(a),$ then $F'(x) = f(x)$ a.e. Here are my questions: What allows me to say $h= f - g \implies h' = f' - g'$ ? I would think it's just the differentiability of $f, g,$ and $h$ . I know $f$ is differentiable because it's monotone increasing, and $g$ is differentiable because it's absolutely continuous and thus of bounded variation. Is this correct? Is f' bounded? In order to apply Lemma 5.9, f' must be both bounded and measurable. I could also use Thm 5.10, which requires $f'$ to be integrable, but I'm not sure if I have integrability, either. $\textbf{Theorem 5.10:}$ If $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ , 
 and $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt + F(a),$ then $F'(x) = f(x)$ a.e. Is it necessary to let $g(x) = \int_a^x f'(t) dt + g(a)$ , or can I let $g(x) = \int_a^x f'(t) dt$ ? I would think I need the former in order to use 5.9 or 5.10, but I saw a proof that used the latter. Is there any difference in the two approaches?",['real-analysis']

1534634,Restricted sheaf on a subset,"Let $F$ be a sheaf of $k$-algebras on a topological space $X$.  So by definition, $F$ is a contravariant functor from the category of open sets of $X$ to the category of $k$-algebras, satisfying a certain patching condition and a uniqueness condition. If $U$ is open in $X$, then we can define a restricted sheaf $F_{|U}$ on $U$, where for $V \subseteq U$ open, we set $F_{|U}(V) = F(V)$. Suppose now that for each $U$ open, $F(U)$ is actually a $k$-subalgebra of functions $U \rightarrow k$.  Then for any subset $W$ of $X$, not necessarily open, we may define a restriction sheaf $F_{|W}$ on $W$, where for $U$ open in $W$, we say that a function $f:U \rightarrow k$ lies in $F_{|W}(U)$ if and only if there exist open sets $U_i$ of $X$, and functions $f_i \in F(U_i)$, such that $U = W \cap (\bigcup\limits_i U_i)$, and $f_{|W \cap U_i} = f_{i|W \cap U_i}$ for each $i$. My question is, suppose we do not assume that the objects $F(U)$ (for $U$ open in $X$) are actually sets of functions from $U$ to $k$.

In order to be compact $M$ has to be closed and bounded. $\|A\|=\sqrt {\sum_{i,j} {a_{ij}}^2}=\sqrt n $ and hence bounded. So $\operatorname{Tr}(A)<\sqrt n $. Hence $M$ is bounded. Now we have to prove that $M$ is closed. Let $\operatorname{Tr}(A_n)$ be a sequence of matrices converging to $\operatorname{Tr}(A)$ where $A_n$ is a sequence of orthogonal matrices.

1535505,Calculating derivative of a special matrix exponential,"I am trying to calculate the following derivative: Let $V,W$ be fixed $n \times n$ real matrices. Define $A(t)=e^{V+tW}$. What is $A'(0)$? I do not assume $V,W$ commute. (If they commute, it becomes trivial since then $A(t)=e^Ve^{tW}$). Here is the problem as I see it: Define $A(t)=e^{\alpha(t)}$ where $\alpha(t)$ is a (smooth) path inside $Mat(n,\mathbb{R})$. $e^{\alpha(t)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha(t)^k}{k!} \Rightarrow (e^{\alpha(t)})'=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha(t)^k)'}{k!}$ But the formula $(\alpha^k)'=k(\alpha^{k-1})\alpha'$ is not necessarily valid if $\alpha,\alpha'$ do not commute. Here is what happens when we try to calculate $(\alpha^2)'$: By the Leibniz rule: $(\alpha^2)'=(\alpha \cdot \alpha)'=\alpha' \cdot \alpha + \alpha \cdot \alpha' \neq 2\alpha \cdot \alpha'$ if $\alpha,\alpha'$ do not commute. The general formula is* $(\alpha(t)^n)'=\sum_{k=1}^n\alpha(t)^{k-1}\alpha'(t)\alpha(t)^{n-k}$, so plugging this into the series formula of matrix exponential does not give you something managable, at least not immediately. Is there a way to claculate (or at least give an estimate of) the derivative $A'(0)$? Can we deduce if it's zero? Another approach is maybe to use the BakerâCampbellâHausdorff formula but so far it didn't work for me. *Note that while in general it seems that there is no simpler closed expression for $(\alpha^n)'$, maybe there is till hope that the specific ""exponential series"" with this term plugged in is tractable in some sense.","['matrices', 'lie-groups', 'matrix-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'multivariable-calculus']"

So when $\Delta$ is positive $C$ is effectively: $$C = \sqrt[3]{\frac{\Delta_1 + i\sqrt{4\Delta_0^3 - \Delta_1^2}}{2}}$$ So obviously the $i$ in $C$ cancels with the $i$s in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ roots, and we get 3 real roots.

1535635,reference request for a book on high dimensional probability and data analysis written for mathematicians,"I hope someone can help with this. I am a statistician looking for a good book on high dimensional probability and data analysis. Basically I am looking for the equivalent of Terry Tao's 2 volume set on Analysis, but for high dimensional probability. Let me qualify what I am looking for. Now there are a bunch of books out there with these very words in the title. I will list some below. But most of these are geared towards just pure machine learning folks or computer science. So often books on high dimensional data focus on techniques like Principle Components Analysis or Lasso, etc., to analyze high dimensional data. In developing these models, the authors start off with strong parametric assumptions about exponential family distributions or independence, etc. These book lack any sort of organic development of a theory behind adding dimensions to a data set or changes in the patterns of symmetry as a data set grows larger--both in dimensions and in the number of observations. A basic probability text book will begin with a definition of random variables and work its way towards the Central Limit Theorem. While that is good for an intro stats course, there are a lot of problems with assuming normality even in high dimensional situations. 
An example of such a book is: Geometric Structure of High-Dimensional Data and Dimensionality Reduction Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications (Please note that I am not critizing any of the books mentioned. I am just saying that these books don't fit my particular need.) So what I am looking for is a more analytic look at how probability varies as dimensions get rather high. I use Terry Tao's book as an example of a wonderful development of analysis from basic foundations. I am looking for the same treatment for high dimensional data. I am not sure if I should be looking at a book on measure theory, or calculus on manifolds, or where? Any suggestions would really be appreciated.","['information-geometry', 'probability', 'soft-question', 'reference-request']"

1536092,Compact subsets of Banach spaces,"Is a theorem of Mazur that a closed subset $K$ of a Banach space $X$ is compact if, and only if, there is a sequence $(x_n)$ of $X$ such that $|x_n|\to 0$ and $K\subseteq \overline{\operatorname{conv}}\{x_n:n\geq 0\}$, where $\overline{\operatorname{conv}}\{x_n:n\geq 0\}$ denotes the clousure of the converx hull of the sequence $(x_n)$. I'm trying to understand the proof given in the book Classical Banach Spaces I, by  J. Lindenstrauss and  L. Tzafriri. If $K$ is a compact subset of $X$, then there is points $x_{1,1}\dots x_{n_1,1}\in X$ such that 
$$2K\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{n_1}B_{\frac{1}{4}}(x_{i,1})$$
Now, why must
$$K_2 = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n_1}\left[B_{\frac{1}{4}}(x_{i,1})\cap 2K-x_{i,1}\right]$$
be compact? He then, by induction, obtain, for each $j\geq 2$, points $x_{1,j},\dots,x_{n_j,j}\in X$ such that $$K_j = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n_j}\left[B_{\frac{1}{4^{j}}}(x_{i,j})\cap 2K_{j-1}-x_{i,j}\right]$$
is compact. Given a $x\in K$ there is a $1\leq i_1\leq n_1,\dots, 1\leq i_{k}\leq n_k$ such that 
$$x - \sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{x_{i_j,j}}{2^j}\in \frac{1}{2^k}K_{k+1}$$ Why must $x\in \overline{\operatorname{conv}}\{x_{i,j}: j\geq 1\text{ and } 1\leq i\leq n_j\}$? Also I would like to know if there is another proof of this fact.",['functional-analysis']
1536102,Writing power series for $AR(2)$ model polynomials,"So I have found the following problem in my textbook without solutions, which presents the $AR(2)$ process defined by 
$$X_{t} = 0.5X_{t-1} + 0.25 X_{t-2} + Z_{t}$$
I am asked what the polynomial $\phi(z)$ for this model is, and further to write the polynomial as a product of linear terms in $z$ and show how to expand the inverse of each of these linear terms as a power series in $z$, while showing why these power series converge for small enough $z$. The first part of the problem I found easy, and I found the polynomial is 
$$ \phi(B) = 1 - 0.5B - 0.25 B^{2}$$
with roots $r_{1}, r_{2} = \dfrac{0.5 \pm \sqrt{1.25}}{-0.5}$. $\implies$ since the roots lie outside the unit circle, there exists a solution in the causal form $\sum \limits_{j=0}^{\infty} \theta_{j} Z_{t-j}$. But I do not know what is meant by ""expanding the inverse of each linear term as a power series"", or how I should go about doing that for this problem. Further, I don't really see the purpose?","['power-series', 'statistics', 'stationary-processes']"
1536108,"Find the pdf of $Y = g(X)$, where $X$ is a uniform random variable","The question is as follows: Let $X$ be a uniform random variable over $(-1,2)$. Let $g(x) = |x|$. Find the pdf of $Y = g(X)$. And here is my take so far: $$f(x) = \begin{cases} 1/2 & \text{ if } -1 \leq x \leq 2, \\
       0   &  \text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$ The cdf of $Y$: $F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(|X| \leq y)$. and from here I know I have to divide intervals but I don't know how to do that. I assume I have to divide it in $4$ different cases where if $y > 0$, if $y > 2$, or $0 < y <2$, $y > 2$? And find cdf and take derivative to find pdf.","['uniform-distribution', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'random-variables']"
1536110,Misinterpretations of Hilbert's Theorem?,"I've seen a few posts here that make certain claims that are related to Hilbert's theorem. For instance: ""I know that there is no complete surface embedded in $\Bbb R^3$ of constant curvature $-k$ for any $k$."" ""However, as Hilbert showed us, the reverse is not true; we cannot embed the hyperbolic plane into Euclidean 3-space."" ""$H^2$ does not isometrically embed in $R^3$ (Hilbert's theorem)."" However, these should only apply to smooth ($C^\infty$) embeddings. Nash-Kuiper, particularly, guarantees the existence of an isometric $C^1$ embedding, since the Klein disk model is a short map from $H^2 \to \Bbb R^3$. This was noted in the answer to this MO question . There's also this answer to the same question, which says there's no $C^2$ embedding. But then on the other hand, this page on hyperbolic crochet at Cornell claims that the crochet models are not $C^1$ and can be extended indefinitely, which would appear to violate Hilbert's theorem. At this point, I'm very confused about what is and isn't allowed regarding isometric embeddings of $H^2$ into $\Bbb R^3$. Obviously no infinitely differentiable isometric embedding exists, but there are obviously $C^1$ embeddings of the whole space. Furthermore, there are also isometric embeddings of compact subsets of $H^2$ into $R^3$, such as the crochet models, and it's not clear what differentiability restrictions there are for that. Is there some way to better understand the slew of somewhat-contradictory statements made above? What, exactly, is and isn't allowed regarding isometric embeddings of $H^2$ into $R^3$?","['differential-geometry', 'hyperbolic-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'surfaces']"
1536134,"About Wald's equation, why can't I simply use total expectation to prove?","Wald's equation: for i.i.d r.v $X_i$, if $N$ is a stopping time, then:
$$E \sum_{i=1}^N X_i = E[N] E[X_1]$$ I just read this equation, but it seems to me if I do:
$$E \sum_{i=1}^N X_i =E_N [\sum_{i=1}^N X_i|N]=E_N[NEX_i]=E[N]E[X_1]$$ I don't know what's wrong with this proof. But in this proof it does not use the fact that $N$ is stopping time.","['probability', 'stochastic-processes']"
