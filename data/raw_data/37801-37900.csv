367168,Combinatorics riddle: Sorting people in a cinema line.,"Say i want to go to the cinema. There are two types of movies. Action movie. Drama movie. Because action is more interesting it costs 50$. And the cost for drama is 10€. There are 200 people which wanna go action movie. 100 of those have 50 dollar bills, And the other 100 people got 100 dollar bill. In addition there are 150 people which wanna buy a ticket for the drama movie, So that 80 have 10€ bill, and the other 70 got 20€ bills. At the start of the day the cinema is empty, In how many ways can you sort the 350 people in a line so that anyone would be able to get an exact change for his money?","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
367183,Prove the series $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n!)^2}$ converges to an irrational number,"How can one prove that the series $\displaystyle \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n!)^2}$ converges to an irrational number? There's no need to use Taylor expansion, integrals or any advanced/professional techniques. It can be proved using only basic techniques.
My first attempt was to assume that the series does converge to a rational number $ \frac{p}{q}$ and then it follows by definition that for every positive epsilon there exists an integer k such that $ {\sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{(n!)^2} -\frac{p}{q}}<=\epsilon$

I guess it would be nice to somehow show that for any arbitrarily small irrational $r$, $f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)<f\left(\frac{a}{b}+r\right)$, but I am not sure how to do that precisely (though it makes sense intuitively since $\left\{n\frac{a}{b}\right\}=0$ for all $n=mb$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ whereas $\left\{n\left(\frac{a}{b}+r\right)\right\}\ne0\,\forall\,n\in\mathbb{N}$.) Out of curiosity I tried beginning by computing the value of $f\left(x\right)$ for $x\in\mathbb{Q}$. My analysis showed that if $x=\frac{a}{b}$, where (without loss of generality) $\frac{a}{b}\in\left[0,\,1\right]$ and (again, without loss of generality) $\gcd\left(a,\,b\right)=1$ then:
$$f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=\frac{a}{b^3}\sum_{l=1}^{b-1}l\frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln\left(\Gamma\left(\frac{l}{b}\right)\right)\right)$$

367321,Conditional distribution for a label given a scalar feature,"I am trying to create a simple simulation setup for classifiers on toy data. Each data point can has a scalar feature $X$, which is uniformly distributed between -1 and 1. Depending on the feature, this data point is given a label $T \in\{-1,1\}$. One of the thing I want to specify in this scheme is the fraction of positive instances, $\theta$. Thus: $P(X=x)= 1/2, x\in [-1,1]$ $P(T=+1) = \theta$ and $P(T=-1) = 1-\theta$ What I am interested in is in the distribution of T, given X. This has to be analytically traceable. I define, somewhat arbitrary, $P(T=+1|X=x) = Ce^{ax}$, with $a$ a tuning parameter and $C$ a constant to make this distribution correct. Fill this in Bayes' rule: $$P(T=+1|X=x) = \frac{P(X=x|T=+1)P(T=+1)}{P(X=x)} $$
 or $$Ce^{ax} = 2\theta P(X=x|T=+1) $$
integrate over $X$ gives: $$\int_{-1}^1Ce^{ax} dx= 2\theta \int_{-1}^1P(X=x|T=+1) dx$$
$$\frac{C}{a} (e^a-e^{-a})= 2\theta $$ So I get my constant $C$:
$$P(T=+1|X=x) = \frac{\theta a}{\sinh (a)}$$
This is not a good distribution, because , for some values of $a$, for example 1, I obtain probabilities larger than 1: $P(T=+1|X=0.9) = 2.09\theta$, thus incorrect for fractions of positive examples larger than about 0.5. I have the feeling my reasoning is wrong because I mix probability mass functions with probability density functions. If I work with cumulative probability functions an analogue reasoning yields: $$P(T=+1|X\leq x) = \theta \frac{e^{a}-e^{-a}}{(x+1)\sinh (a) }$$
This seems more reasonable, but I don't see how to obtain a function of T, given X. Does someone see what is wrong with my reasoning? Any suggestions for a function of the probability of the label given the feature with the restrictions of the marginal distribution of X and T?

367339,Is a meromorphic function on the Riemann Sphere completely determined modulo scalar by its zeroes and poles and their orders?,"Let's say that all I know about a function $f$ is that it is meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}_\infty$, and that $\{z_i\}$ is the sets of zeroes of $f$, each one of order $n_i$ and $\{\lambda_j\}$ its set of poles, each one of order $m_i$. Does $f$ gets completely determined, modulo a constant scalar, with only this information? I think that I can show this as it follows: if $f$ is meromorphic on the Riemann Sphere, then it is a rational function. If $\alpha :\mathbb{C}_\infty\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is a holomorphic function, then it is constant. If $\alpha$ is not identically zero, then $\alpha f$ is a meromorphic function over $\mathbb{C}_\infty$ with the same set of zeroes and poles with the same orders.

So, I get $$d \omega = df_1 \wedge dx_1 + df_2\wedge x_2$$ $$ = \left( \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} dx_2 \right) \wedge dx_1 + \left(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} dx_1 + \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2}dx_2 \right) \wedge dx_2. $$ $dx_1 \wedge dx_1 = 0$ and $dx_2 \wedge dx_2 = 0$ and so we get $$\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} dx_2 \wedge dx_1 + \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1}dx_1 \wedge dx_2.$$ From the anti commutatitivty law we have $dx_1 \wedge dx_2 = - dx_2 \wedge dx_2$, and so we put this in and collect like terms and get $$\left(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} - \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} \right) dx_i \wedge dx_2,$$ which tells me that $d \omega = 0 \iff \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} = \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2}$, but I'm stuck how to use this to show that $\omega = d \eta$.

367354,Generalizing the 290 theorem.,"I have only just come across the remarkable theorem of Conway about universal quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Z}$; namely that in determining whether a integer coefficient, positive definite quadratic form represents all positive integers it suffices to check that it represents a specific set of 29 integers (the largest of which is 290). Other similar theorems exist too about representing all primes or all odd numbers. I just read the paper by Bhargava and Hanke and found the proof quite elegant. I got thinking about whether it would generalize to other situations. Has anyone has been able to extend the results to other settings? Maybe people have been able to prove similar things over other rings (such as rings of integers of number fields) or maybe people are still considering staying in the integer case and considering representing other sets of integers or considering higher degree forms?","['quadratic-forms', 'integer-lattices', 'number-theory']"

Then $\langle S\rangle = \bigcup \langle T\rangle$ where $T \subset S$ and $T$ is finite. My attempt is below. $\langle S \rangle  \supset \bigcup\langle T\rangle$ is clear, since every $T$ is contained in $S$ and then each $\langle T \rangle$ is contained in $\langle S\rangle $.

Case II. $ x \notin  S $. In this case, there are $a, b \in \langle S \rangle $ such that $ ab=x $.

367462,Killing functions by successive differentiation.,"It is clear that a polynomial function $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$ has the property that some derivative of $f$ vanishes. (Of course, it's the $(n+1)$-th derivative.) One can also check that the reverse implication is true: if $f^{(n+1)}(x) = 0$ (identically), then $f$ has to be a polynomial of degree at most $n$. (There is even a stronger fact, namely if for any $x$ there is $n$ with $f^{(n)}=0$, then $f$ is a polynomial, but that's beside the point here.) If one takes a polynomial-logarithmic function $f$ made up of terms like $x^a \log^b x$, where $a,b$ may be taken rational, then the similar thing remains true: there is $n$ such that $f^{(n+1)}(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. Such functions have polynomial growth: they are bounded by $x^N$ for some $N$ (and for sufficiently large $N$). I would like to know to what extent the reverse is true: Suppose that $f$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and smooth, and that for some $n$, $f^{(n+1)}(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$.

367710,What are the equations for the image of an algebraically defined subset under the Segre embedding?,"Let $\psi: \mathbb{P}^r \times \mathbb{P}^s \to \mathbb{P}^N$ be the Segre embedding with $N = rs + r + s$, as in Hartshorne exercise I.2.14. To be explicit: the image of the pair $([a_0 : \ldots : a_r], [b_0 : \ldots : b_s])$ is $[\ldots : a_ib_j : \ldots]$ in lexicographic order.  Let $[z_{00} : \ldots : z_{rs}]$ be homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^N$. From the proof that $\operatorname{im} \psi$ is a subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^N$ I know that it is the zero locus of the polynomials $z_{ij}z_{kl} - z_{il}z_{kj}$. But what are the equations for $\psi(X) \subset \mathbb{P}^N$ where $X$ is a subset of $\mathbb{P}^r \times \mathbb{P}^s$ defined in an algebraic way? More concretely: I have two conics $C = Z(f) \subset \mathbb{P}^2$ and $D^* = Z(g^*) \subset \mathbb{P}^2$ ($D^*$ is the dual conic of the conic $D = Z(g)$). 
I want to investigate the structure of the incidence correspondence $X = \{(p,\ell) \in C \times D^* : p \in \ell\}$. This can also be described as the set of pairs $([x:y:z],[a:b:c]) \in \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2$ such that $f(x,y,z) = 0$, $g^*(a,b,c) = 0$, and $ax + by + cz = 0$. This embeds into $\mathbb{P}^8$ via the Segre embedding. What are the equations for $\psi(X)$ in $\mathbb{P}^8$? I know that $\psi(([x:y:z],[a:b:c])) = [ax : bx : cx : ay : by : cy : az : bz : cz]$. Hence (I believe) $\psi(X) = \psi(C \times D^*) \cap Z(z_{00} + z_{11} + z_{22})$. But how do I express $\psi(C \times D^*)$ in terms of these new coordinates? For $C$ do I need $f(z_{00}, z_{10},z_{20}) = 0$, or $f(z_{01},z_{11},z_{21}) = 0$, or $f(z_{02}, z_{12}, z_{22}) = 0$, or something completely different? Thanks in advance. Edit : Using the fact that all conics are isomorphic and the 2-uple embedding I can actually assume $C = D^* = \mathbb{P}^1$ (Hartshorne exercise I.3.1(c)).

367740,Substitution problem,"My question is something I've been thinking about for some time now.
Q: Why is it possible to make substitutions or change in variables ?
I mean, how do I know which substitutions are allowed ? For example when we use Vieta's formulas to vanish with a second degree monomial.
Or when we change variables to solve an integral equation. Here is what I think: if we want to solve an equation like this  $ax^2+bx+c=0$
we could turn it into an equation like this one $Ay^2+B=0$ which we know how to solve,
to do that we write $x=u+v$ and we get $a(u+v)^2+b(u+v)+c=0$ which is equivalent to
$av^2 + (2au+b)v + au^2+bu+c=0$ that we know how to solve if we get rid of the term $(2au+b)v$ but to do that we make $u=-b/2a$. But why are we allowed to write $u=-b/2a$ ?
I think that we can do that because we are solving this equation in the set $\mathbb{R}$, and we can write any real number in the form $-b/2a$.
That's why we can't solve $x^2+1=0$ by setting $x=\sqrt{y}$, in other words, because the function $\sqrt{}$ is not surjective.
Finally, I think that we are allowed to make a substitution if the set we are trying to solve the equation in  (in this case $\mathbb{R}$) allows us to write the number as the substution we make.
Is that somewhat right?",['algebra-precalculus']

Compute $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{1+x^3}$ by integrating $\dfrac{1}{1+z^3}$ over the contour $\gamma$ (defined below) and letting $R\rightarrow \infty$ . The contour is $\gamma=\gamma_1+\gamma_2+\gamma_3$ where $\gamma_1(t)=t$ for $0\leq t \leq R$ , $\gamma_2(t)=Re^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}t}$ for $0\leq t \leq 1$ , and $\gamma_3(t)=(1-t)Re^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ for $0\leq t \leq 1$ . So, the contour is a wedge, and by letting $R\rightarrow \infty$ we're integrating over one third of the complex plane.  I believe this means we are integrating over the entire complex plane under the substitution $u=x^3$ .  There are poles at $-\zeta$ for each third root of unity $\zeta$ , so there's only one pole in this wedge.  I'll just refer to that pole as $-\zeta$ . I guess this means that we can use the residue theorem to say $$\int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{1+z^3}dz=2\pi i\eta(\gamma,-\zeta)\operatorname{Res}\left(\frac{1}{1+z^3},-\zeta\right)=2\pi i \lim_{z\rightarrow -\zeta}\left[(z+\zeta)\frac{1}{1+z^3}\right]$$ I can't evaluate this limit.

Outside of $\frac{1}{4}$, we say the function is 0.  We call this function $V_1(x)$.  Then we translate the graph of $V_1(x)$ to the first deleted interval of the Smith-Cantor-Volterra set $\left[\frac{3}{8},\frac{5}{8}\right]$.

Prove that if for matrix $A$, $P(A)$=0, then $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1}$ is $k-1$ degree $A$ polynomial. Here's my proof, I would like to know if that's ok: Let $P(x)$ be defined: $P(x)=a_1x+a_2x^2+ \dots +a_kx^k+a_{k+1}$. We know $P(A)=0$, so that: $$P(A)=a_1A+a_2A^2+\dots +a_kA^k+a_{k+1}=0$$  $$A(a_1+a_2A+ \dots +a_kA^{k-1})=-a_{k+1}$$ $-a_{k+1}I=-a_{k+1}$, so: $$A(a_1+a_2A+ \dots +a_kA^{k-1})=-a_{k+1}I$$
$$A{(a_1+a_2A+ \dots+a_kA^{k-1})\over -a_{k+1}}=I.$$ Lets define: $A^{-1}={(a_1+a_2A+\dots +a_kA^{k-1})\over -a_{k+1}}$, and then we found that $AA^{-1}=I$. Thus $A$ is invertible, and we can see $A^{-1}$ is a $k-1$ degree polynomial. QED Is this proof valid? Thanks in advance.

368059,maximising the angle $\theta$,"OK, suppose I have two points in cartesian coordinate system, say $P(x_1,y_1)$ and $Q(x_2,y_2)$. I have a line as well, that is, for simplicity
$$y=mx$$
Assuming that 
$$y_1\neq mx_1,y_2\neq mx_2$$
I need to find the point $A$ on the line so that the angle $PAQ$ is maximum. So I assume that point is $A(h,k)$. So the slope of $PA$ is ${k-y_1 \over h-x_1}$, and that of $QA$ is ${k-y_2 \over h-x_2}$. Then I find $\theta$ (the angle $PAQ$) by the inverse tangent way
$$\theta=arctan({m_1-m_2 \over 1+m_1m_2 })$$
For the maxima, I differentiate this angle with respect to either $h$ or $k$ using the fact that $k=mh$ and put it to zero. Then all of that and the answer comes out. I plug that back and get a value. But the range of $arctan$ is from $[{-\pi \over 2},{\pi \over 2}]$. I do not think my way will work for obtuse angles. Is there any other way?

368167,Bounding the magnitude of the Fourier Transform of the indicator function of a Voronoi cell,"Suppose I define the set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ to be a single cell within a larger 3D Voronoi tessellation on a set of known points. $A$ is thus convex and simply-connected. Without loss of generality (for this problem at least), I take the seed point which resides within $A$ to be the origin. Let the $n$ points neighboring $A$, and which define its boundaries, be given by $\vec{x}_1, ..., \vec{x}_n$. Assume that this set of neighbors is arranged so that $A$ does not run off to infinity, i.e. it is compact. Note that the boundary of $A$ is continuous but does not have a derivative everywhere. Define the Fourier transform
$$
\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q}) = \int d\vec{x}\, \chi_A(\vec{x})\, \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\,\vec{q}\cdot\vec{x}}\, ,
$$
where
$$
\chi_A(\vec{x}) = 
\cases{1 & $\vec{x}\in A$ \\ 0 & $\vec{x} \not\in A$ }
$$
is the indicator function of $A$. What I'm looking for is some kind of simple upper bound on the magnitude of $\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})$, i.e. some function $f(\vec{q})$ so that $\left|\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})\right| \leq f(\vec{q})$.  Of course, we always have that $\left|\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})\right|$ is less than or equal to the volume of $A$, but that's not good enough. I need something less trivial that will allow me to bound the fall off of the tail of $\left|\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})\right|$. I expect (I may be wrong) that there should exist some bound of the form
$$
\left|\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})\right| \,\leq\, \frac{c}{\left|\vec{q}\right|} \qquad\qquad (1)
$$
for some $c > 0$. For example, if $A$ is a rectangular parallelpiped with sides $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, one can show that such a bound does exist, with
$$
c = \frac{2 L_1 L_2 L_3}{\min_i L_i}
$$
being the optimal value of $c$.  If (1) is a valid form for a bound on $\left|\hat{\chi}_A(\vec{q})\right|$, then what value of $c$ (it doesn't have to be the best possible $c$) works for my Voronoi cell?  If something better than (1) exists, then what is it?

The two interpretations I see: a) $\{(a_n)_{n \ \in \mathbb{N}} : (a_n)_{n \ \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ converges in } (X,d_1) \}$ = 
$\{(a_n)_{n \ \in \mathbb{N}} : (a_n)_{n \ \in \mathbb{N}} \text{ converges in } (X,d_2) \}$, which would allow a sequence to converge to different points for the different metrics. b) $\forall a \in X, (a_n)_{n \ \in \mathbb{N}} \subset X: a_n \rightarrow_{d_1} a \Leftrightarrow a_n \rightarrow_{d_2} a$, where a convergent sequence must have the same limit point in both metrics.

368363,Some questions about representation theory in the modular case,"I'm working on a paper which uses representation theory in order to compute some characters and deduce arithmetical statements about certain field extensions. Let $\Delta$ be a group of order prime to $p$, $p$ a prime number. The claim is now: The irreducible representations of $\Delta$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of $p$ elements are in bijection with the irreducible representations of $\Delta$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The author first translates into module language and afterwards uses the properties of the $cde$-triangle (as one can find in Serre's book) as follows: He first uses Maschke's theorem to say that in our case every $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-module $N$ is projective. Then every projective $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-module $N$ has an (up to isomorphism) unique lift to a projective $\mathbb{Z}_p[\Delta]$-module $M$ for that $$N = M / pM$$ holds (Serre), what is still clear to me. Then he states, that two $\mathbb{Z}_p[\Delta]$-modules $M$ and $M'$ are isomorphic iff $M \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $M' \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{Q}_p[\Delta]$-modules (Serre again). He then says that finding the irreducible characters of an $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-module $M$ is the same as finding the absolutely irreducible characters of the $\mathbb{Q}_p[\Delta]$-module $M' \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$, which i don't understand. Why absolutely irreducible? I thought a character is absolutely irreducible if it remains irreducible in an algebraic closure, but that would be $\mathbb{C}_p \otimes M$, right? The claim then follows translating back to representation language. But why should every representation of $\Delta$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ should have the form $M \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$? Also I was wondering if the following assertion is true:
If one has a short exact sequence 
$$1 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow 1$$
of $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-modules, is it true that the irreducible character of $B$ is the sum of the irreducible characters of $A$ and $C$? Addition: What is the general point of lifting a representation over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ to the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$? Are the latter simpler to calculate because of characteristic $0$?
