1325511,Unique Entire Function with Prescribed Values,"Problem. Show there is a unique entire function $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that the coefficients of the Taylor expansion about the origin $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}z^{n}$ are nonnegative and $f$ satisfies $f(k)=\cosh(\sqrt{k})$ for all positive integers $k$. The existence of such a function isn't difficult. If we let $\sqrt{z}$ denote the principal branch, then on the positive real line, $$f(z):=\cosh(\sqrt{z})=\cos(i\sqrt{z})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}(i\sqrt{z})^{2n}}{(2n)!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{z^{n}}{(2n)!} \tag{1}$$ is analytic. The power series on the right-hand side has infinite radius of convergence, and therefore defines an entire function. Clearly, the Taylor coefficients are nonnegative, and by construction $f(k)=\cosh(\sqrt{k})$ for all positive integers $k$. My trouble is proving the uniqueness assertion. Clearly, if we have any two entire functions $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ satisfying the required hypotheses, then their difference $g:=f_{1}-f_{2}$ has zeros on the positive integers. But I am not able to see much else at this time. In particular, I don't have an idea how to use the hypothesis that the Taylor coefficients are nonnegative to prove uniqueness. If we could show that $g$ vanishes on a set with a limit point, then uniqueness would follow by the identity theorem. Or if we could show that $g$ had a zero somewhere of infinite order, then uniqueness would also follow by the existence of power series expansions. As this is an old qual problem , I would suggestions for getting on the right track, rather than complete solutions. But any help would be appreciated.",['complex-analysis']
1325522,Maximal ideals of polynomial ring,"We know that if $k$ is algebraically closed, then each maximal ideals of $k[x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n]$ are  of the form $(x_1 - a_1, x_2 - a_2, \ldots, x_n - a_n),$ where $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n \in k$ (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz Theorem). In the case when $k$ is not algebraically closed is it correct to say that a maximal ideal $m$ of  $k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$ has residue field $k$ if and only if $m = (x_1 - a_1, x_2 - a_2, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$ for some $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in k.$ Thank you.","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

However $r(t)=r'(t)$ can't match the initial value problem $r(t;1,0,0)=(1)$ because: $$r(t)=1 \Rightarrow r'(t)=0 \Rightarrow r(t) \neq r'(t)$$ Where did I go wrong?","['polar-coordinates', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1325602,On applying Whitney's extension theorem to suitable closed sets,"Whitney's extension theorem states that if $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^k$ in some sense to be specified below, then $f$ can be extended to $\mathbb{R}^n$ so that it is real analytic on $D^c$. Now let me specify what it means to be $C^k$ in the sense that we want - we will call this Whitney $C^k$. We say that $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is Whitney $C^k$ (on $D$) if there exist functions $f_\alpha: D \to \mathbb{R}$, $|\alpha| \le k$ (note here $\alpha$ is a multindex with $n$ entries) s.t. for all $x,y \in D$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^n$, $$f_\alpha (x) = \sum_{|\beta| \le k-|\alpha|} \frac{f_{\alpha + \beta}(y)}{\beta !} (x-y)^\beta +R_\alpha(x,y)$$ with $R_\alpha$ having the following property: Given any point $z \in D$ and any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ s.t. if $x, y \in A$ and $|z-x|< \delta$ and $|z-y|< \delta$ then $|R_\alpha (x,y)| \le \epsilon |x-y|^{k-|\alpha|}$. Now for my question.  I am wondering for what closed sets can we say that if $f$ is $C^k$ (see the Edit below for definition) then it is Whitney $C^k$.  Phrased differently, I am wondering for what closed sets (with $C^k$ functions defined on these sets) can we apply Whitney's extension theorem. I have been able to show that if $D$ is the closure on an open bounded convex set and $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^k$ then $f$ is Whitney $C^k$. To see this one applies the multivariable Taylor's theorem (integral version- see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem#Taylor.27s_theorem_for_multivariate_functions ). Notice that the proof, and therefore the estimates, rely on integrating along a line segment - this is where convexity is used.  I suspect this can be generalized to $D$ being the closure of a connected open set with suitably smooth boundary (i.e. $C^\infty$). References are also appreciated. Edit:  For completeness, let me add the definition of $C^k$ on the closure of an open set. Let $U$ be an open set, then $f: \overline{U} \to \mathbb{C}$ is $C^k$ if all the partial derivative of $f$ up to order $k$ extend continuously to $\overline{U}$.","['differential-topology', 'analysis', 'taylor-expansion', 'analyticity']"

The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two.

1325778,A question on the generalization of Cartesian Product,"In Halmos’s Book, it is written that, The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets $X$ and $Y$ was defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x$ in $X$ and $y$ in $Y$.  There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and a certain set of families. Consider, indeed any particular unordered pair $\{a,b\}$ with $a\ne b$, and consider the set $Z$ of all families $z$, indexed by $\{a,b\}$, such that $z_a\in X$ and $z_b\in Y$. If the function $f$ from $Z$ to $X\times Y$ is defined by $f(z)=(z_a,z_b)$, then $f$ is the promised one-to-one correspondence. Till this portion I think I understand (I have quoted this portion so that my next quote doesn't seem abrupt. If anyone has a problem with it, he/she is welcome to remove it.). In fact, I think that I can prove the one-to-one correspondence also which follows trivially from the definition of ordered pairs. However, the portion that I cannot understand is the following, The difference between $Z$ and $X\times Y$ is merely a matter of notation. ... . The generalization is now straightforward. If $\{X_i\}$ is a family of sets $(i\in I)$, the Cartesian product of the family is, by definition the set of all families $\{x_i\}$ with $x_i\in X_i$ for each $i$ in I. Why in the first line it is said that the difference between $Z$ and $X\times Y$ is “merely” a matter of notation? Also, I don’t understand anything from the rest portion of the quote. In fact, I think that I am having trouble understanding the portion mainly because of the fact that I am unable to construct examples.

\le 2 \sum_{n=2}^\infty (|x_n|^2+|\alpha|^2 |x_n|^2) \le 2(1+|\alpha|^2) \|x\|^2$$
hence $\|T\| \le \sqrt{2(1+|\alpha|^2)}$.
This is actually worst that the bound found below so not very useful. $$x=(0,0,1+\alpha,0,...) \Longrightarrow Tx=(1+\alpha)(0,\alpha,-1,0,...)$$
hence $\|T\| \ge \sqrt{1+|\alpha|^2}$. Thinking of $T$ as sum of $T_1$ and $T_2$ defined respectively as
$$\begin{cases}
  (T_1 x)_1 = 0, \\
  (T_1 x)_n = -x_n, \quad n \ge 2,

$$\begin{cases}

  (T_2 x)_n = \alpha x_n, \quad n \ge 2,

noting that $\|T_1\|=1$ and $\|T_2\|=|\alpha|$, we conclude from the triangle inequality that

We also check the numerator for any removable singularities, and we see that: $$\sin(z)=0, \forall z=n\pi, n \in \mathbb N$$ Now since the pole we have is $z=0$, we have a removable singularity for $z=0$ in the numerator with $\sin(0)=0$, where, in the above, $n=0$. Does this mean that, with the one removable singularity, the order of the denominator is reduced by one, to give $z^3$ in the denominator? If so, what formula or means should I use to calculate the residue at z=0? Since we have a removable singularity, its residue should be zero.

  of bounded variation $α(x)$ , such that, for any continuous function $f(x)$ , we have $$A[f(x)]=\int_0^1f(x)dα(x).""$$ Then  more things were extended in this theorem and there were so many such representations were done from 1909 till now.. Some of them are: (a.)The Hilbert space representation theorem for the (continuous) dual space of a Hilbert space; (b.)The representation theorem for positive linear functionals on $C_c(X)$ , where X is a locally compact Hausdorff space; (c.) The representation theorem for bounded linear functionals on $C_c(X)$ , where X is a locally compact Hausdorff space; Then it is generalized to bounded linear operators: (d.) Let $S$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, $X$ be a Banach space  and $T$ be a weakly compact operator from $C_0(S)$ to $ X$ . Then there exists a unique regular vector valued measure $\mu: \mathcal{B}(S)\to X$ , such that $$ T(f) = \int f  d\mu,  ~~f\in C_0(S).$$ (e.) $T:C_0(S,X)\to Y$ be a bounded linear operator where $S$ is  locally compact Hausdorff space and $X,Y$ are Banach spaces.Then if for every $x\in X$ , the bounded linear operator $T_x: C_0(S)\to Y$ defined by $$T_x(g)=T(g\circ x), \ \ g\in C_0(S) $$ is weakly compact, then there exists a Baire operator valued measure $m : \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{B}_a(S))\to L(X,Y)$ countably additive in strong operator topology such that $$T(f)=\int f\ dm , \ \ f\in C_0(S,X)$$ After that this result is extended to locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space also.

1326429,Intuition of multivariable chain rule,"I was learning/reviewing the chain rule for multivariable calculus and was wondering why the multivariable calculus chain rule is a function of summation of products of derivatives rather than just product of derivatives, like its single variable counter part. In particular I want to fix how I think of the chain rule and generalize my thoughts/intuition to multiple variables. Usually the way I used to remember the chain rule was by the usual ""trick"" of ""canceling out"" the middle dummy variables i.e. consider y = f(x(t)), then: $$ \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} $$ and since the dx's cancel out, the chain rule works! Wohooo, super intuitive, easy to remember and even though its not mathematically rigorous, at least it sort of makes sense. However, for multiple variables the equation looks very different. Consider $z = f(x(t), y(t) )$, then its chain rule derivative is: $$ \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} $$ Even though there is some of the same ""canceling"" trick, the equation doesn't quite make as much intuitive sense to me or where it came from. So what is the intuition behind this equation? Why is it a summation of products of derivatives? Anyone have a good way of generalizing the intuition from one variable to multiple variables? Or maybe we have to change our intuition in a significant way and that is fine, as long as its more useful for multiple variable calculus!

First, this agrees with the definition that a domain is a ring in which $0$ is the only zero divisor (in particular, $0$ is required to be a zero divisor, which fails in the zero ring). Second, this way, for a positive integer $n$, the ring $\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z$ is a domain if and only if n is prime. What are the arguments for/against this convention (besides the ones listed above)? What does the literature (i.e. your favorite textbooks) say on this matter? Note that I am specifically talking about domains , not integral domains ; the only difference between them aside from the non-triviality assumption mentioned here is that domains are not required to be commutative.","['abstract-algebra', 'reference-request', 'definition', 'ring-theory']"

1326546,"If $\sum a_n = +\infty$, with $a_n ≥0$, then we can find two disjoint subseries diverging","While trying to solve a problem from my measure theory class, I started to wonder about the following result: Consider a sequence of positive terms $\left \{ a_n \right \}_{n=1}^\infty$ such that $\sum a_n = +\infty$. Is it always possible to find two disjoint subsequences $\left \{a_{n_j} \right \}_{j=1}^\infty$ and $\left \{a_{k_j} \right \}_{j=1}^\infty$ such that? $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{n_j}=+\infty=\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{k_j}$$
(Disjoint means$\ \left \{a_{n_j} : j \in \mathbb{N}\right \} \cap \left \{a_{k_j} : j \in \mathbb{N}\right \}=\emptyset$ ) Intuitively, it seems true, but I wasn't able to prove it, nor think of a counterexample. Given a infinite set $I\subset \mathbb{N}$, since $$\sum_{n \in I}a_n + \sum_{n \not \in I}a_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = +\infty$$ It follows that one of the two sums on the left must be divergent. If both are, we are done.

In addition, he further states that multiplying by $f$ gives a sheaf homomorphism $O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}}(-D) \to O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}}$ and that doing this for $1, t^{-1} \in \Gamma(\mathbb{P}^{1},O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}} (D))$ gives $$O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}}(-D) \oplus O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}}(-D) \to O_{\mathbb{P}^{1}}$$ Could someone please explain these implications in detail?

1326879,Limit of normal hazard rate,"I'm trying to work out the asymptotic behavior of the normal hazard rate as $x$ gets very large.  To be clear, that's the behavior of $$ h(x) = \frac{ \phi(x)}{1-\Phi(x)} \qquad \text{ as } \qquad x \rightarrow \infty$$ Where $\phi(\cdot)$ and $\Phi(\cdot)$ are the pdf and cdf respectively of the standard normal. I don't think anyone on this site or elsewhere online has addressed this question specifically.  The closest I found was this , but that is much more general than what I want. In the limit, this looks like it is linear (picture below), but I can't quite show why or to what limit.  Both numerator and denominator go to 0 as $x$ gets very large. My best attempt at figuring this out was to apply L'Hopital's rule. \begin{align*}
  \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} h(x) &= \frac{ \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \phi'(x) }{ \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} -\phi(x)} \\

Now I know that the next line is not ok, but I tried it anyway, because I had no better ideas.  What if I ""cancel"" the $\phi(\cdot)$ functions in the numerator and denominator?  That is, I tried the following: $$ \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} h(x) \overset{?}{=} x$$ It turns out that this is a pretty good approximation to the limiting behavior. See the picture below ($h(x)$ solid, candidate $h'(x)$ dashed).  But I haven't proved anything, which is annoying.  It also turns out that this limit doesn't work in some other applications (not discussed here!). So, to summarize my questions: What is the asymptotic behavior of the normal hazard rate?  I couldn't find a reference. Is $h'(x)=x$ in the limit? If so, why?  My abuse of L'Hopital's rule isn't the reason.","['probability', 'probability-distributions']"

I'm looking for a way either to prove it, or whether an existing theorem is already known from which this would follow. Stated another way, given arithmetic progression $ax + b$ where $a, b$ coprime and $ax + b$ is prime infinitely often, it is at least once the case that $ax + b$ produces a $cd$ + 2 prime, where c, d are prime.  The list of $cd$ + 2 primes is A063638 on OEIS. What we know: A Chen prime is a prime $p$ such that $p + 2$ is either prime or semiprime. Chen proved in 1966 there are infinitely many of these.
There are also infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p - 2$ is specifically semiprime (not just prime-or-semiprime). Friedlander and Iwaniec proved this in their 2010 book. Note that I'm not asking whether $ax + b - 2$ is semiprime infinitely often.  I just need it to happen once, that $ax + b$ is prime while $ax + b - 2$ is semiprime.

I'm trying to use Chen's theorem as a strategy to show this--- in other words, to show that $(Px + 1)(P + 2)$ must be semiprime at least once (and so, ergo, $Px + 1$ must be prime at least once) when $P(P + 2)x + (P + 4)$ is prime.

A case that I do not have a good feel for is the cusp ( $y^2=x^3$ in the plane). It's not hard to write down equations in this case. However, what I would like to know is if there is any good geometric rationale that one can ""tell just by looking"" that blowing up the cusp gives a strict transform which is tangent to the exceptional divisor at a point?

1327090,"If a 17%-efficient system becomes ""10 times more efficient"", what is the absolute efficiency? Or is this not possible?","Sometimes in reading around the net, I see things like ""This car could be ten times more efficient if the drivetrain and engine were replaced by batteries and electric-motor wheels."" If I'm not mistaken, the usual tank-to-wheel efficiency of the average car is 17%. Ten times this would be 170%, which is just not possible. So what does ""ten times more efficient"" really mean? I suspect it's exponential or logarithmic in some way, but I can't even guess the formula. Or maybe most tech blogs are dumb and don't know what they're really saying mathematically? Maybe it's just not possible? In general, if something is x % efficient, and you want it to be p times more efficient, what would be the result, y %?","['percentages', 'statistics']"
1327091,Why does $\{1 \dots 9\}$ behave like this under multiplication mod $10$?,"When I multiply the set $$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$ by $2$ and take the remainder mod $10$, I get the following repeated pattern. $$\{2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$$ Multiplication by any even number creates a similar effect (e.g. multiplication by $4$ is $\{4, 8, 2, 6, 0, 4, 8, 2, 6\}$). But multiplication by odd numbers instead creates a permutation of the elements. $$
\times 3 = \{3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7\}\\
\times 9 = \{9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\}\\
$$ even when the number is not prime. My question is: why? It clearly has to do with the fact that $2$ and $5$ are the prime factors of $10$, but I'm not sure how. Specifically, I'm wondering: Why does multiplication by $k \pmod{n}$ fail to be injective when $\gcd(k, n) \ne 1$? Why does multiplying by $2$ split the integers mod $10$ into two identical groups? In the case when multiplication by $n$ is injective, is there any way to relate $n$ to the permutation caused by multiplying by it? I know this is related to group theory, but don't know group theory, so I would appreciate learning the names of the concepts on display here as well.","['group-theory', 'modular-arithmetic']"

1327140,Proving that every patch in a surface $M$ in $R^3$ is proper.,"Problem Prove that if $\mathbf{y}:E\to M$ is a proper patch, then $\mathbf{y}$ carries open sets in $E$ to open sets in $M$. Deduce that if $\mathbf{x}:D \to M$ is an arbitrary patch, then the image $\mathbf{x}(D)$ is an open set in $M$. (Hint: To prove the latter assertion, use Cor 3.3.)
Finally, prove that every patch $\mathbf{x}:D\to M$ in a surface $M$in $R^3$ is proper. (Hint: use the above to note that $(\mathbf{x}^{-1}\mathbf{y})\mathbf{y}^{-1}$ is continuous and agrees with $\mathbf{x}^{-1}$ on an open set in $\mathbf{x}(D)$.) First I will write down the definitions of some of the terms above, as they are given in the text. Definitions A patch $\mathbf{x}:D\to R^3$ is a one-to-one regular mapping of an open set $D$ of $R^2$ into $R^3$. A proper patch is a patch for which the inverse function $\mathbf{x}^{-1}:\mathbf{x}(D)\to D$ is continuous. A surface in $R^3$is a subset $M$ of $R^3$ such that for each point $\mathbf{p}$ of $M$ there exists a proper patch in $M$ whose image contains a neighborhood of $\mathbf{p}$ in $M$. For a function $F:R^n\to M$, each patch x in $M$ gives a coordinate expression $\mathbf{x}^{-1}(F)$ for $F$. A function $F:R^n\to M$ is differentiable provided all its coordinate expressions are differentiable in the usual Euclidean sense. 3.3 Corollary If x and y are patches in a surface $M$ in $R^3$ whose images overlap, then the composite functions $\mathbf{x}^{-1}\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}^{-1}\mathbf{x}$ are differentiable mappings defined on open sets of $R^2$. My Question I don't know how to prove the first part. Since y $^{-1}:\mathbf{y}(E)\to E$ is continuous, so by definition of continuity,  given an open set $O$ in $E$,${\mathbf{y}^{-1}}^{-1}(O)=\mathbf{y}(O)$ is open in $\mathbf{y}(E)$, but how can we guarantee that this is open in $M$ when $\mathbf{y}(E)$ is not the whole of $M$? Moreover, taking this as given, how can I use Cor 3.3 to prove that the image of an arbitrary patch is open in $M$? And finally, how can these be used to show that every patch in a surface is proper? I think I'm confused with the topology in surfaces, and this is inhibiting my thinking. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can write down a clear exposition of the above problem.","['geometry', 'vector-analysis', 'surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"
1327155,Showing that $\Bbb R^3$ is not homeomorphic to $S^3$.,"I want to show that $\Bbb R^3$ is not homeomorphic to $S^3$. Now this means I want to show there is no bijective function, $f$, from $\Bbb R^3$ such that both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous. I can't seem to solve this, however some thoughts come to mind: If there is no bijective function I am done. All bijective functions cannot be continuous(for some reason) and I'm done. For the first one, this seems as though it would be true. $\Bbb S^3$ 'lives in' $\Bbb R^4$ but I suppose it is bounded, whereas $\Bbb R^3$ is a lower dimension space, but it is unbounded. Hmmm. For the second one, I can think geometrically that we can't wrap $\Bbb R^3$ into a fourth dimensional ball, such that points that are close in $\Bbb R^3$ are still close in $S^4$, but no idea how to make this rigorous. Essentially my problem comes down to: Showing two things are homeomorphic is logically, but showing they are not seems really hard. Thanks","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1327231,About the standard textbook example for Laplace Equation and Separation of Variables,"Here is a standard example typically cited to illustrate the technique of separation of variables. Suppose we have a semi-infinite rectangular strip formed by boundaries $x=0, y=0, y=a$ and we are to solve Laplace equation $\Delta f=0$ with boundary conditions (i) $f=0$ when $y=0$ or $y=a$ (ii) $f \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$ (iii) $f\equiv C$ when $x=0$ ($C$ is a constant). A typical solution by separation of variables will first yield the ""solution pieces"" $f_n=c_n e^{-n\pi x/a} \sin(n\pi y/a)$ (where $n=1,2,...$) which satisfies (i) and (ii), and then use the method of ""handwave"" and claim that by linearity, we can consider the candidate $f_\infty := \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n e^{-n\pi x/a} \sin(n\pi y/a)$ and try to find $c_n$ such that (iii) holds. My question : Yes, the Laplace operator is linear but that only allows for us to piece together finitely many solutions. How do we know that the infinite sum $f_\infty$ is still ""differentiable"" within the strip? (by ""differentiable"" here, I meant that the second partial derivatives exist). For example, along the line $x=0$, isn't it the case that $f(0,0)=f(0,a)=0$ but $f(0,y)=C$ for $0<y<a$ so the fitted $f_\infty$ could not be differentiable at $(0,0)$ and $(0,a)$. Are these the only two spots where $f_\infty$ is allowed to be (or turns out to be) non-differentiable? In addition, this example confuses me because when I learnt the general formulation of a Laplace equation problem, there is the PDE $\Delta f=0$ and boundary conditions, and I always thought that $\Delta f$ should at least make sense on the boundary but in this example, the points $(0,0)$ and $(0,a)$ are doomed to fail. If we completely allow $f$ to be non-differentiable at boundary, then theorems like uniqueness of solution would not hold (e.g. piecewise define $f$ by choosing any $f$ that satisfies $\Delta f=0$ on the interior and separately take the boundary values). So why is it that we consent the poor behavior of the points $(0,0)$ and $(0,a)$ here?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
