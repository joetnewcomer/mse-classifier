3945968,Formula to work out likely number of unique items,"There is an unknown quantity of unique prizes. Each time you play the game, you get a prize. The likelihood of getting any type of prize X is equal to getting the likelihood of any other type, and winning a prize does not decrease the likelihood that that type will be won in future. I won 14 prizes. Where '1' represents a type of prize I have never won before, and '0' represents winning a type of prize I have won before, I got the following ordered list: (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0) I know that each time I play the game, the probability of getting a prize that I have not won before is (N-a)/N where a is the number of unique prizes I have already won.

3945991,"If $r>0$ and $r\notin \mathbb{N}$, is there a simple method to evaluate $ \sum_{n=\lceil r \rceil}^{\infty} {\binom{n}{r}^{-1}}?$","Let $r>0,r\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{N}$ . Empirically, I have noticed the following relation: $$
\sum_{n=0}^{\lfloor r \rfloor} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{r}} = - \sum_{n=\lceil r \rceil}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{r}};
$$ in particular, $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{r}} =0}$ . Note that if $r$ is an integer, the finite sum is not well-defined, although we do have $$
\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \operatorname{Res}  \left(\frac{1}{\binom{z}{k}},z=j\right)= k\cdot\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{k-1}{m}(-1)^m=0,
$$ so in this sense the sum 'cancels'. Mathematica returns the closed-form of $$
\sum_{n=\lceil r \rceil}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{r}}=  \frac{\lceil r\rceil }{(r-1) \binom{\lceil r\rceil }{r}},
$$ which when $r\in\mathbb{N}$ reduces to this question , but I don't know how to derive that myself. Maybe I'm not fully understanding the answers there but I don't think the same tricks apply when the sum doesn't telescope. So in summary, my questions are: Can someone explain the closed-form? Is there a simple, conceptual reason the finite sum is the negative of the infinite sum?","['gamma-function', 'binomial-coefficients', 'closed-form', 'sequences-and-series']"

The first part is easier. To prove that $T(v) = v,$ for some $0 \neq v \in \Bbb R^3$ it is enough to show that $\det (T - I) = 0.$ Now $$\begin{align*} \det (T - I) & = 1 \cdot \det (T - I) \\ & = \det (T) \det (T - I) \\ & = \det (T^t) \det (T - I) \\ & = \det (T^t T - T^t) \\ & = \det (I - T^t) \\ & = \det (I^t - T^t) \\ & = \det ((I - T)^t) \\ & = \det (I - T) \\ & = (-1)^3 \det (T - I) \\ & = - \det (T - I) \end{align*}$$ This shows that $2 \det (T - I) = 0 \implies \det (T - I) = 0,$ as required.

3946061,Coefficient of $\frac{1}{1-x-x^2-..-x^{d-1}}$ and its asymptotic,"Let $C_n$ be the set of all compositions of n such that each letter is one of ${1,2,\ldots,d-1}$ . A. Calculate the generating  function of the number of compositions in $C_n$ . B. For each composition $\pi \in C_n$ define $f(\pi)$ as the number of letters that equal $1$ .
Find yhe generating function of $\sum_{n\geq 0} \sum_{\pi \in C_n}  q^{f(\pi)} x^n$ . C.Find the expectation of the number of letters that equal 1 (1's appearances) in these compositions, and analyze it asymptotically . *Generally: Composition of $n$ : a sequence of numbers in $N$ such that their sum equals $n$ . For example: $C_0={\epsilon}$ , $C_1={1}$ , $C_2={11,2}$ , $C_3={111,12,21,3}$ . In this question, a composition of a number $n$ , consists of numbers from the set { $1,2,\ldots, d-1$ } where $d$ is a given number. This is what I did: A. Every compisition of n = empty compisition $\cup$ (1 / every compisition) $\cup$ (2 / every compisition) $\cup$ .... $\cup$ ((d-1) / every compisition).
so if x counts the length of a number, then the  generating function $C(x)$ for the problem satisfy: $C(x)=1+xC(x)+x^2C(x)+\cdots+x^{d-1}C(x)$ (1 for the empty compisition) $C(x)=1+C(x)(x+x^2+\cdots+x^{d-1})$ Therefore, $C(x)=\frac{1-x}{1-2x+x^d}=\frac{1}{1-x-x^2-...-x^{d-1}}$ B.Let $q$ counts the appearances of 1 and $x$ as we mentioned counts the length of a number.
Then: $C(x)=1+qxC(x,q)+x^2C(x,q)+\cdots+x^{d-1}C(x,q)$ $C(x,q)=1+C(x,q)(qx+x^2+\cdots+x^{d-1})$ So, $C(x,q)=\frac{1-x}{x^d+(q-1)x^2-(q+1)x+1}$ C. We have to calculate $[x^n]C(x,1)=[x^n] C(x)$ and $[x^n] ([(d/dq) C(x,q)]_{q=1})=\frac{x}{(1-x-x^2-...-x^{d-1})^2}=xC(x)^2$ so the expectation will be the proportion of them. But I could not see how the coefficients can be calculated!
I did not succeed to connect it to Fibonacci series which I know (the case of d=2). I would be thankful for any help to show part C. Thanks in advance","['combinatorial-proofs', 'recurrence-relations', 'asymptotics', 'combinatorics', 'generating-functions']"

Ted's hint made me think of the following: take $u$ to be negative inside the ball and $0$ on the boundary. Then of course $A_b < 0 = A_s$ .

3946167,Extremal distribution of random variable that averages to a given value,"Denote by $\mathcal M$ the set of probability measures over $[0,1]$ that average to $p$ . This is a convex set and I am trying to characterize its extreme points. For any $x$ , $y$ such that $0\leq x< p< y\leq 1$ define \begin{align*}
\lambda_x^y = \frac{p-y}{x-y}\cdot\delta_x+\frac{x-p}{x-y}\cdot\delta_y
\end{align*} where for any measurable $A\subseteq [0,1]$ and $a\in[0,1]$ , $\delta_a(A)=\mathbf 1(a\in A)$ . Since $\delta_x$ (resp. $\delta_y$ ) averages to $x$ (resp. $y$ ) we get that $\lambda_x^y$ averages to $\frac{p-y}{x-y}\cdot x+\frac{x-p}{x-y}\cdot y=p$ and so is in $\mathcal M$ . I am very tempted to say that the extreme points of $\mathcal M$ is the set $\{ \lambda_x^y : 0\leq x< p < y \leq 1 \}\cup \{ \delta_p \}$ without being able to prove it. If I am not mistaking I am supposed to prove that (ignoring the $\delta_x$ component) If for some $x$ and $y$ and $a\in[0,1]$ , $\lambda_x^y=a \mu+(1-a) \nu$ then $\mu=\nu=\lambda_x^y$ . For any $\mu\in\mathcal M$ there is a probability measure $\kappa$ over $[0,p]\times[p,1]$ such that $\mu(A)=\int \lambda_x^y(A) d\kappa(x,y)+\mu(\{ p \})\delta_p(A)$ for all measurable $A\subseteq [0,1]$ . For the first point, it is quite clear by positivity of the measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ that their support $\{ x,y \}$ , then there is only one probability measure with such a support that averages to $p$ and it is $\mu_x^y$ . For the second statement however it is less clear to me, Maybe one way to proceed is computing the integral \begin{align*}
\int \lambda_x^y(A) d\kappa(x,y)&=\int \left( \frac{p-y}{x-y}\cdot\delta_x(A)+\frac{x-p}{x-y}\cdot\delta_y(A) \right) d\kappa(x,y)\\
&=\int_{\left(A\cap [0,p]\right)\times [p,1]}\frac{p-y}{x-y} d\kappa(x,y)+\int_{[0,p]\times\left(A\cap [p,1]\right)}\frac{x-p}{x-y}d\kappa(x,y)
\end{align*} It now feel easier to separate cases $A\subseteq [0,p]$ and $A\subseteq [p,1]$ to set one of the two integral to $0$ but I still don't know how to proceed. Actually thinking about how I could use it in my research it would be much more powerful to not enforce $x\leq p \leq y$ but just that $p$ is in the convex hull of $\{ x,y \}$ and then we get repetition $\lambda_x^y=\lambda_y^x$ but the of extreme points is the same. This makes $\kappa$ a probability measure over $[0,1]^2$ where we have to be careful assigning $0$ probability to sets $A\times B\subseteq [0,1]^2$ where the convex hull of $A\cup B$ does not contain $p$ . Here is the last thing I tried :
Denote $a_x^y=\frac{p-y}{x-y}$ , for $\mu \in\mathcal M$ and $A$ measurable \begin{align*}
\mu(A)&=\int_{[0,p)} \delta_x(A) d\mu(x)+\int_{(p,1]} \delta_y(A) d\mu(y)+\mu(\{ p \})\delta_p(A)\\
&=\int_{[0,p)\times (p,1]} \left(\frac{a_x^y}{a_x^y}\delta_x(A) + \frac{1-a_x^y}{1-a_x^y}\delta_y(A) \right)d\mu\otimes\mu(x,y)+\mu(\{ p \})\delta_p(A)\\
\end{align*} It feels like we can define $\kappa$ as a function of $\mu\otimes \mu$ and $a_x^y$ , I cannot finish the argument though.","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory', 'linear-programming', 'convex-hulls']"

3946247,Finding four square roots of $\small\begin{bmatrix}3 & -4\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$,"This question is about finding the 4(!!) square roots of a 2 by 2 matrix. The method I use is through Diagonalization (or actually doing the ""opposite""). I have no problem finding the four roots of a 2 by 2 matrix that has real eigenvalues (and thus real eigen vectors). Heck, I found 8 roots of a 3 by 3 matrix that has real eigen values. The problem I am running into is if the to be square rooted matrix has complex eigenvalues. In my view, the method should work the same, but somehow the algebra is letting me down. Example: Find the four square roots of $ \begin{bmatrix}3 & -4\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$ . Note, I found this matrix by squaring $ \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1\\1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$ , so obviously this is one root as well as taking opposite of its entries. So here is my work: The characteristic equation of $ \begin{bmatrix}3 & -4\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$ is $(3-\lambda)^2+16=0$ from which we find $\lambda=3+4i$ and $\lambda=3-4i$ . An eigenvector for $\lambda=3+4i$ is $ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\-i  \end{bmatrix}$ and an eigenvector for $\lambda=3-4i$ is $ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\i  \end{bmatrix}$ . So the given matrix can now be diagonalized: $ \begin{bmatrix}3 & -4\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$ = $ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix}$$ \begin{bmatrix}3+4i & 0\\0 & 3-4i\end{bmatrix}$$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix}^{-1}$ . I found $ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix}^{-1}$ = $\frac{1}{2i} \begin{bmatrix}i & -1\\i & 1\end{bmatrix}$ which is $ \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5i\\0.5 & -0.5i\end{bmatrix}$ . It's easy to find out that the square roots of $3+4i$ are $2+i,-2-i$ , and of $3-4i$ are $2-i,-2+i$ . So now I would arrive at my 4 solutions: $$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}2+i & 0\\0 & 2-i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5i\\0.5 & -0.5i\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}2+i & 0\\0 & -2+i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5i\\0.5 & -0.5i\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}-2-i & 0\\0 & 2-i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5i\\0.5 & -0.5i\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\-i & i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}-2-i & 0\\0 & -2+i\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}0.5 & 0.5i\\0.5 & -0.5i\end{bmatrix}$$ When I work out my first candidate, I get a matrix, but when squared it doesn't give me $ \begin{bmatrix}3 & -4\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$ and so something isn't right.

This includes all finite permutations, but it should also include any permutation $\pi$ for which $|\pi(i)-i|$ is bounded. Does $H$ include any more permutations than this, or is this all of $H$ ? We can define $\Gamma_x\subset G$ as the set of $\pi$ for which $\sum a_{\pi n}=x$ . If $\sum a_n=x$ then this is like a stabilizer, but I don't see any obvious reason to expect it to be a subgroup. Or, for general $x$ , any reason to expect $\Gamma_x$ to act like a coset (e.g. the $\Gamma_x$ s being translates of each other). Do these sets satisfy properties similar to cosets? (One thing I can see is that each $\Gamma_x$ is a union of right cosets of $H$ .) Given a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ we can define $\Gamma_f$ as the set of those $\pi$ for which $\sum_{n\le N}a_{\pi n}\sim f(N)$ . There are many variations we could use on this definition, and we could even use it for divergent series $\sum a_n$ . Or, even if $S=\sum a_n$ is convergent, we could define $\Gamma_f$ (for $f\to 0$ ) according to $-S+\sum_{n\le N}a_{\pi n}\sim f(N)$ (so we partition $G$ according to how permutations affect the convergence of the series). I expect describing $\Gamma$ s becomes much harder in these situations. Do we know more answers to any of these questions for specific series, like harmonic or alternating harmonic?","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"

One of the section problems is to go back and find the solution on the interval (-3, 3). This is the equation: $$(x^2 - 9)\frac{dy}{dx}+xy=0$$ I've banged my head against the wall for a little bit before I remembered to check the Existence and Uniqueness theorem for IVP's to see if a solution exists on the interval: $$f(x,y)=-\frac{x}{x^2-9}y$$ and $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=-\frac{x}{x^2-9}$$ Both of which are defined everywhere but x=-3 and x=3 so I believe a unique solution must exist on all of the intervals I mentioned above.

Therefore $||V_nx|| \to 0$ for all $x$ , and $V_n$ converges to $0$ in SOT. For the second part, i'm quite sure that the adjoint of $V_n$ is $(V^*_nx)(k)= 0$ if $k\leq n$ , and $(V^*x)(k)=x(k-n)$ otherwise. It is then enough to mention an $x$ for which the limit $V^*_nx$ does not exist. $x_0=1,0,0...$ will do, since the sequence $V^*_nx_0$ is not Cauchy and therefore not convergent. Therefore, $V_n^*$ does not converge in SOT. any corrections and remarks are greatly appreciated, thank you!","['hilbert-spaces', 'solution-verification', 'functional-analysis']"

3947217,Sampling inspection - Joint distribution,"I am self-learning probability theory from William Feller's Introduction to Probability theory and its applications . I would like to ask for some help in deriving the correct solution to the below very interesting problem. Problem IX.12 Suppose that items with a probability $p$ of being acceptable are subject to inspection in such a way, that the probability of an item being inspected is $p'$ . We have four classes, namely, ""acceptable and inspected"", ""acceptable but not inspected"" and so forth with probabilities $pp'$ , $pq'$ , $p'q$ and $qq'$ . We are concerned with double Bernoulli trials. Let $N$ be the number of items passing the inspection desk (both inspected and uninspected) before the first defective is found, and let $K$ be the (undiscovered) number of defectives among them.  Find the joint distributions of $N$ and $K$ , and the marginal distributions. Solution (My Attempt). We have, \begin{array}{c|cc}
& \text{Acceptable} & \text{Defective}\\
\hline
\text{Inspected} & pp' & qp'\\
\text{Undiscovered} & pq' & qq'\\
\end{array} The first defective item is found at trial number $(n+1)$ , if the preceding $n$ items were either acceptable or uninspected. $P\{\text{Acceptable} \cup \text{Uninspected}\} = P\{\text{Defective},\text{Inspected}\}^C = 1 - qp'$ $N$ is the waiting time to the first defective. $N$ follows a geometric distribution. $P\{N = n\} = (1 - qp')^n qp' \tag{1}$ $K$ is the number of undiscovered defectives among these $n$ trials. So, given that we waited for time $n$ to find the first defective, the probability that the number of defectives equals $k$ is given by, $P\{K = k \vert N = n\} = {n \choose k} (qq')^k p^{n-k}$ Thus, the joint distribution \begin{align*}
P\{K = k, N = N\} &= P \{K = k \vert N =n \} \cdot P \{N = n\}\\
&= {n \choose k} (qq')^k p^{n-k} (1 - qp')^n qp'
\end{align*} However, the textbook states the expression for the joint distribution as, $$
P\{K = k, N = n\} ={n \choose k}(qq')^k p^{n-k} qp'

It then goes on to say, in the subsection Specifying a function By a formula , from the same page (emphasis added): For example, ${\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {1+x^{2}}}}$ defines a function $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose domain is ${\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,}$ because ${\displaystyle 1+x^{2}}$ is always positive if $x$ is a real number. On the other hand, $f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}$ defines a function from the reals to the reals whose domain is reduced to the interval $[â1, 1]$ . which would seem to suggest that, for the latter function, one should write:

I've consulted 2 different textbooks, as well as the Wikipedia page; unfortunately, although great care is given to distinguish the codomain and the image, all the explanations and examples provided do not address whether the domain is $A$ or if it may be a subset of $A$ . Moreover, several textbooks I've read have made much ado about the fact that one ought to distinguish between a function and a function of and imply that the distinction is to be found in these definitions (unfortunately, none of them consider it important enough to actually clarify within their own text).","['notation', 'functions']"

\end{align} These equations rely on the ant traversing a flat 2D plane. I have been thinking a lot about how to generalize this simple model to an arbitrarily curved (but smooth) 2D surface. We can imagine the infinity of geodesics that intersect $\big{(}x(t_0), y(t_0)\big{)}$ . Then $\theta(t_0)$ essentially picks one of those geodesics. While $v > 0$ and $\omega = 0$ , the ant moves what it thinks is ""straight forward."" It will follow the same geodesic until it chooses to turn ( $\omega \neq 0$ ) onto a different geodesic. Suppose our smooth surface is defined by an injective function that embeds it in 3D Euclidean space: $$
r : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\ ,\ \ \ r(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix} \bar{x}(x,y) \\ \bar{y}(x,y) \\ \bar{z}(x,y) \end{bmatrix}
$$ We have its Jacobian and any necessary higher partial derivatives as well: $$
J(x,y) := \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}(x,y)\,\ \frac{\partial r}{\partial y}(x,y)\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 2}
$$ The velocity vector is, $$
\dot{r} = \dot{x}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \dot{y}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y} = J \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix}
$$ The scalar velocity $v$ in the flat model would correspond to the magnitude of the velocity vector in the general model, i.e. $v = ||\dot{r}||$ . Letting $\hat{\tau}$ be the direction of $\dot{r}$ we can write, $$
\dot{r} = v\hat{\tau} = J \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix}
$$ Non-degeneracy of the surface-coordinates implies that $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ is linearly independent of $\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}$ . Thus, $J$ is full-column-rank. Left-multiplying the above by $J^\intercal$ and inverting yields, $$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y}\end{bmatrix} = v(J^\intercal J)^{-1}J^\intercal\hat{\tau} \tag{1}
$$ It's noteworthy that $J^\intercal J$ is the metric tensor in coordinates. This is almost the ODE I'd need for $\big{(}x, y\big{)}$ , but $\hat{\tau}$ is undefined when evaluating the right-hand-side. I tried defining $\hat{\tau}$ in terms of some rotation $\theta$ of the surface gradients (with $\dot{\theta} = \omega$ ) and got cool but erroneous results: $$
\text{This ^ uses Eq.1 with:}\ \ \ \ \hat{\tau} = \cos(\theta)\frac{\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}}{\big{|}\big{|}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\big{|}\big{|}} + \sin(\theta)\frac{\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}}{\big{|}\big{|}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}\big{|}\big{|}}
,\ \ \ \ \dot{\theta}=\omega$$ The error is that for $\omega = 0$ and $v \neq 0$ , holding $\hat{\tau}$ some fixed $\theta$ away from a gradient direction doesn't cause the ant to move along a geodesic. Moreover, it doesn't make sense for $\theta=0$ to yield a $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ -follower... $\hat{\tau}$ really needs to be parallel-transported along the surface. Parallel-transport is a statement about how tangent vectors (e.g. $\dot{r}$ ) change , so we need to examine acceleration. If the ant never turned or varied speed, then its acceleration would be strictly normal to the surface (acceleration just due to curvature): \begin{gather}
\langle \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}, \ddot{r} \rangle \ \ \overset{\dot{v}=\omega=0}{=}\ \ 0\\[3pt]
\langle \frac{\partial r}{\partial y}, \ddot{r} \rangle \ \ \overset{\dot{v}=\omega=0}{=}\ \ 0
\end{gather} The left-hand-side can be expressed more compactly as $J^\intercal \ddot{r}$ . Expanding $\ddot{r}$ , \begin{align}
\ddot{r} &= J \begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{bmatrix} + \dot{J} \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix}\\[4pt]
J^\intercal \ddot{r} &= J^\intercal J \begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{bmatrix} + J^\intercal \dot{J} \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix} \ \ \overset{\dot{v}=\omega=0}{=}\ \ 0
\end{align} and finally left-multiplying by the inverse metric tensor $(J^\intercal J)^{-1}$ , $$
\begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{bmatrix} + (J^\intercal J)^{-1} J^\intercal \dot{J} \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix} \ \ \overset{\dot{v}=\omega=0}{=}\ \ 0 \tag{2}
$$ This is the geodesic equation . The second term can be simplified with Christoffel symbols, but that isn't really necessary. $\dot{J} = \dot{x}\frac{\partial J}{\partial x} + \dot{y}\frac{\partial J}{\partial y}$ is just another computable function to me. I can use Equation 1 to convert some arbitrary initial $\hat{\tau}$ heading direction into an initial condition on $\big{(} \dot{x}, \dot{y} \big{)}$ and then integrate Equation 2 for the motion along the geodesic as long as $\dot{v} = \omega = 0$ . I suspect that to generalize this to the $\omega \neq 0$ and $\dot{v} \neq 0$ case, the right-hand-side will have to be some function of them rather than $0$ . But what function? Edit: And how do we encode ""heading"" so that the ant can ""stand still"" when $v = 0$ , and even turn ""in-place"" (about the normal)? What (if any) ODE system describes the ant / unicycle moving on an arbitrary smooth 2D surface? $$
\overset{?}{f}(x,y,\theta;v,\omega,r) = 0
$$ where $f$ can involve any derivatives up to second-order. Thanks in advance! :) Addendum The answer given by Kajelad below seems correct! Though for posterity I would like to add an elaboration of that answer here, using notation consistent with the above and providing more motivation / steps. First lets define the Frenet-Serret basis: $$
\hat{\tau} := \frac{\dot{r}}{||\dot{r}||},\ \ \ \ \hat{\eta} := \frac{\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial r}{\partial y}}{\big{|}\big{|}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial r}{\partial y}\big{|}\big{|}},\ \ \ \ \hat{\beta} := \hat{\eta} \times \hat{\tau}
$$ These are the standard tangent, normal, and binormal vectors respectively ( $\hat{\tau}$ being the same as I had previously defined) and they span $\mathbb{R}^3$ orthonormally at all points on the surface. Thus, the ambient acceleration vector can be expressed as some linear combination of them. $$
\ddot{r} = a\hat{\tau} + b\hat{\beta} + c\hat{\eta}
$$ From the previous discussion, we know that if $\dot{v} = \omega = 0$ , then $\ddot{r} = c\hat{\eta}$ will yield geodesic motion. Therefore $a$ and $b$ must depend multiplicatively on $\dot{v}$ and $\omega$ . We also know that this must reduce to the traditional model in the Euclidean case. As we'll see, the correct relations are (rather intuitively), $$
a = \dot{v},\ \ \ \ b = \omega v
$$ For clarity in the following algebra I'll define these shorthands, $$
q := \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix},\ \ \ \ \tilde{J} := (J^\intercal J)^{-1}J^\intercal
$$ This makes our previous Eq.1 appear nicely as $\dot{q} = v\tilde{J}\hat{\tau}$ , and we also have $\ddot{r} = J\ddot{q} + \dot{J}\dot{q}$ . Thus, $$
J\ddot{q} = \dot{v}\hat{\tau} + \omega v \hat{\beta} + c\hat{\eta} - \dot{J}\dot{q}
$$ Left-multiplying by $\tilde{J}$ not only cancels the leftmost $J$ , but also kills the $c\hat{\eta}$ term because $J^\intercal \hat{\eta}=0$ . $$
\ddot{q} = \dot{v}\tilde{J}\hat{\tau} + \omega v \tilde{J}\hat{\beta} - \tilde{J}\dot{J}\dot{q} \tag{3}
$$ Next, lets define our generalization of ""heading"" as the unique vector $h(t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying, \begin{align}
\hat{\tau} &= Jh\\[4pt]
h &= \tilde{J}\hat{\tau} = \tfrac{1}{v} \dot{q}
\end{align} This vector exists because $\hat{\tau}$ lives in the tangent space (the span of $J$ ). Furthermore, $\hat{\beta}$ also lives in the tangent space as a $90^\circ$ rotation about the normal from $\hat{\tau}$ . Calling that transform $R^{\hat{\eta}}_{90^\circ} \in \mathbb{SO}3$ , we have, \begin{align}
\hat{\beta} &= R^{\hat{\eta}}_{90^\circ} \hat{\tau}\\[4pt]
\tilde{J} \hat{\beta} &= (J^\intercal J)^{-1} J^T R^{\hat{\eta}}_{90^\circ} J h \tag{$\hat{\tau} \to Jh$}\\[4pt]
&= \sqrt{|J^\intercal J|}(J^\intercal J)^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}h\\[4pt]
&=: Rh
\end{align} We can derive an ODE for $h$ by using the above relations to put Eq.3 in terms of $h$ . \begin{align}
\ddot{q} &= \dot{v}h + \omega v Rh - v\tilde{J}\dot{J}h\ \ \tag{$\tilde{J}\hat{\tau} \to h,\ \tilde{J}\hat{\beta} \to Rh,\ \dot{q} \to v h$} \\[4pt]
\dot{v}h + v\dot{h} &= \dot{v}h + \omega v Rh - v\tilde{J}\dot{J}h \tag{$\ddot{q} \to \dot{v}h + v\dot{h}$}\\[4pt]
\dot{h} &= \omega Rh - \tilde{J}\dot{J}h \tag{cancellations}
\end{align} The $\dot{J}$ is still hiding a $\dot{q}$ dependence, so lets expand it in terms of the Hessian $H := \frac{dJ}{dq}$ . $$
\dot{J} = \dot{x}\frac{\partial J}{\partial x} + \dot{y}\frac{\partial J}{\partial y} =: H \odot \dot{q} = v H \odot h
$$ Finally, we arrive at, $$
\dot{h} = \omega Rh - v\tilde{J}(H \odot h)h
$$ The rightmost-term can be simplified using Christoffel symbols, but that isn't critical as it is already something I can compute. This equation mirrors Kajelad's result: $$
\dot{T}^i = \omega R^i{}_j T^j-v\Gamma^i{}_{jk}T^jT^k
$$ So in summary, the generalized model is: \begin{gather}
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix} = vh \tag{4}\\[4pt]
\dot{h} = \omega Rh - v(J^\intercal J)^{-1}J^\intercal(H \odot h)h \tag{5}\\[4pt]
R = \sqrt{|J^\intercal J|}(J^\intercal J)^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \tag{6}
\end{gather} where heading $h(t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ , $J$ and $H$ are the embedded surface's Jacobian and Hessian respectively, and $v$ and $\omega$ are the specified ant/unicycle movements. This could be (more commonly) written in terms of the metric tensor ( $J^\intercal J$ ) and Christoffel symbols (gradients of the metric tensor). The appeal of that form is that it's completely independent of any embedding of our surface $r$ ; only the metric tensor field is needed. Note that the units are consistent ( $H$ has units of inverse-space). In the Euclidean case, the Hessian vanishes and the ODE reduces to the classic model. Lastly, if $\omega = 0$ , the $\dot{h}$ equation becomes a parallel-transport / geodesic equation. Now to test in simulation! ( Concluding remark: While very mechanical, the above derivation is a reflection of some rather fundamental and cool concepts in differential geometry, which Kajelad's answer used explicitly and may have gone beyond my background with. The key idea here, I think, is the Levi-Civita connection, or more specifically, the "" covariant-derivative ."" We took a covariant-derivative in the above when we took a regular derivative of $\dot{r}$ and then projected it onto the tangent space by left-multiplying $\tilde{J}$ . Instead, I could have used the abstract parlance and just defined $\nabla_{\dot{r}} \dot{r} = \ddot{r} - c\hat{\eta}$ . The ugliness in my derivation above is in how tied it is to coordinate representations of all the geometric quantities involved. To those unfamiliar with differential geometry, however, it is far more grounded, and can even serve as a gateway to the beautiful abstraction.)","['kinematics', 'geodesic', 'mathematical-modeling', 'differential-geometry']"

&\le (1-\alpha)^k \text{ ( from 7)}\end{aligned}$$ This is how I tried to solve item i). Note that,for $i \ge 1$ $$\{\tau_A > i + 1\} \subseteq \{\tau_A > i\}$$ It means that $$\mathbb P_x(\tau_A = \infty) = \mathbb P_x(\lim_{k \to \infty}{\tau_A > kn}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} {\mathbb P_x({\tau_A > kn})} \le \lim_{k \to \infty}{(1-\alpha)^k} = 0$$ It implies that, $$\mathbb P_x(\tau_A < \infty) = 1 - \mathbb P_x(\tau_A = \infty) = 1$$ Finally, $$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}_x[\tau_A] &= \frac{n}{n}\mathbb E_x[\tau_A]\\
&= n\mathbb E_x\left[\frac{\tau_A}{n}\right]\\
&= n\left(\sum_{i \ge 1}{\mathbb P_x\left(\frac{\tau_A}{n} > i\right)}\right)\\
&= n\left(\sum_{i \ge 1}{\mathbb P_x(\tau_A > ni)}\right)\\
&\le n\left(\sum_{i \ge 1}{\mathbb (1-\alpha)^i}\right)\\
&=n \cdot \frac{1}{1 - (1-\alpha)} = \frac{n}{\alpha}

Prove that $\lambda_n (C(A,h))=\frac{h}{n}\cdot \lambda_{n-1}(A)$ . Where I struggle Assuming that $C(A,h)$ is (Lebesgue-)measurable, this is a simple application of Fubini. How Fubini is used is all clear to me. However, why is $C(A,h)$ measurable?
It seems one could roughly argue as follows: As $A$ and $[0,h]$ are measurable so is $A \times [0,h]$ . As $A \times [0,h]$ is measurable it is the union of a null set and a Borel set. $C(A,h)$ is the image of $A \times [0,h]$ under a certain diffeomorphism (c.f. Deducing a formula for the volume of a cone over a $J$-measurable set. ). Diffeomorphisms map null sets to null sets, and Borel sets to Borel sets. Hence, $C(A,h)$ is (as a finite union of measurable sets) measurable. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to use the above properties of diffeomorphisms. What are other ways to prove the claim? Please only give a hint to set me thinking.","['lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'analysis', 'fubini-tonelli-theorems']"

3948943,"Showing the set $\{x: x = 2^{-k} \ k\in \mathbb{N}\ \text{or}\ x = 0 \}$ is open, closed, or neither - solution feedback","This question comes from Shifrin's  Multivariable Mathermatics - Sec 2.2 - 1(b) , it asks:
Show that the set $B = \{x: x = 2^{-k} \ k\in \mathbb{N}\ \text{or}\ x = 0 \}$ is open, closed, or neither and prove your answer. I've come to the conclusion that the set is closed and I wanted some assistance on tightening up my solution. Solution The tools I have up to this point to show that a set is closed are: i) show all convergent sequences in the set converge to a point in the set. ii) Show that the complement of the set is open. I chose to approach this problem using (ii), but I do have a question about how I could use (i) I'll ask at the end. So first I have to figure out what it means to be in $C = \mathbb{R} - B$ . To me this meant $\mathbb{R} - B = \{x: x \neq 2^{-k}\ \text{and} x \neq 0\}$ . To build off of this idea I drew a picture of the number line with the points belonging to $B$ and observed how the points of $C$ would have to be to satisfy my argument. So after some fiddling around I defined the points of $C$ as follows: $$C = \mathbb{R} - B = \{y: y = x\pm \delta\ \text{depending on which side of an $x$ from $B$ that the point $y$ is in relation to}\}$$ . So how do I choose my $\delta$ ? So keep in mind that each $x \in B$ is actually a function of a particular $k$ , so with this in mind I defined $\delta = \min(|2^{-k}-y|, |2^{-(k+1)}-y|)$ . In this set up it means I'm taking a $\delta$ that will take into consideration the possibility of having an open ball over a value $x \in B$ which we don't want. So with this setup I now need to show $C$ is open. Define a point $z \in C$ as $z = x \pm \frac{\delta}{2}$ . By this definition we see that $z \in B(y, \delta)$ . It's here where I'm having trouble completing the proof. So to show the ball is open is dependent on where my $y$ value is, so for a concrete argument let's suppose that $y < 2^{-k}$ . To show $B(y, \delta) \subset C$ means I have to show for all $z \in B(y, \delta)$ that: $$|z - y| < |2^{-k} - y| \\
\Rightarrow\ |z - y| < 2^{-k} - y\ \text{(since assuming $y < 2^{-k}$ case)}$$ I'm having trouble arriving at the conclusion...What I envision happening after some algebra is: $$2^{-(k+1)} < z < 2^{-k}$$ Which would then give me my open ball. So I have two questions: My idea seems to be leading me in the right direction, but needs some fine-tuning. What do I need to do to tighten it up? With regards to the other way of showing closed. In this set it seems like the only sequence is the set itself since the $x = 2^{-k}$ and that will converge to $0$ , but can I actually say that this is true? Couldn't there be some rare sequences that I have not found that are in the set, but since I have not explicitly stated all convergent sequences then I can't use the definition of closed explicitly?","['real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'elementary-set-theory']"
3948978,Can $n$ convex solids in $\mathbb{R}^3$ be mutually touching?,"Say that a collection of $n$ convex solids in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are mutually touching if, for every pair of them, they share some positive-measure part of their boundaries. (That is, we're not permitting the solids to touch only via an edge or a corner.) As an example, if we ""thicken up"" an $n=4$ configuration in 2 dimensions (the maximum, since $K_5$ is nonplanar), then placing a large cube on top of the thickened configuration yields $n=5$ mutually touching convex regions. (By thickening it into a sort of wedge shape, we can put convex solids on both the top and bottom, for $n=6$ .) Do such configurations exist for arbitrarily high $n$ ? For infinitely many solids at once? What if we require the solids be congruent to each other? (Note that if we relax the convexity requirement, the answer to all of these is pretty easily seen to be yes.) I vaguely recall reading a paper which provided an affirmative answer to the arbitrarily high $n$ case with congruent solids; I think it used the Voronoi cells given by equally spaced points on a helix, though it's been several years since I read it.

Suppose that $\mu$ is either a signed or complex measure on $(X,M)$ . In particular, $\mu$ is a function on $M$ . I know that if $\mu$ maps into $[0,\infty)$ , then $d(A,B) = \mu(A \Delta B)$ is a metric modulo the equivalence relation $A \sim B \iff \mu(A\Delta B) = 0$ . This was mentioned in baby Rudin, for instance. More generally, however, if we are given a topology $T$ on $X$ does there consequently exist a canonical topology on $M$ induced by $T$ such that $\mu$ is continuous? Of course, I would prefer if the topology on $M$ were not just the discrete topology. Further, it would be nice if it were metrizable. If the answer is affirmative, a follow up question might be, for instance, ""how coarse can the topology be while still making $\mu$ continuous?""

\\= \frac 12 g^{nl}
\left( \nabla_i R_{jvwl} + \nabla_i R_{jwvl} +\nabla_w R_{jivl} + \nabla_v R_{jiwl} + \nabla_w R_{jvil} + \nabla_v R_{jwil} \right) +
\left( \nabla_j R_{ivwl} + \nabla_j R_{iwvl} +\nabla_w R_{ijvl} + \nabla_v R_{ijwl} + \nabla_w R_{ivjl} + \nabla_v R_{iwjl} \right) -
\left( \nabla_l R_{ivwj} + \nabla_l R_{iwvj} +\nabla_w R_{ilvj} + \nabla_v R_{ilwj} + \nabla_w R_{ivlj} + \nabla_v R_{iwlj} \right)
$$ If I apply the symmetries of the curvature tensor $$
\left( \nabla_i R_{jvwl} + \nabla_i R_{jwvl}  + 2\nabla_w R_{jvil} + 2\nabla_v R_{jwil} \right) +
\left( \nabla_j R_{ivwl} + \nabla_j R_{iwvl}   + 2\nabla_w R_{ivjl} + 2\nabla_v R_{iwjl} \right) -
\left( \nabla_l R_{ivwj} + \nabla_l R_{iwvj}  \right)
$$ I feel like the derivatives involving derivatives in $i,j,l$ should somehow cancel out with the Bianchi identities but I don't get it to work.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
