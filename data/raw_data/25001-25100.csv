Consider there are five children and four seats. Two of them are willing sitting together but only two of them never seat together. $$\left(\begin{pmatrix}
5 \\
2

223593,Page ranking function,"I am working on my bachelor thesis where I attemp to create a focused web crawler. My program is finished and now I am a bit stuck with computing ranking (or rating) of single pages.
I am not trying to build an index of pages or anything. All I want is to rate all pages independently (rating of one page does not depend on the others) according to term frequencies of searched words. At the moment I am using very simple formula: $rating = tfidf + a_1 tf_1 + ... + a_n tf_n$ tfidf ... tf-idf cosine distance of this page from other pages (this compoment actually depends on other pages but it is a very small number and you can ignore it in this question), a_i ... coefficients (some big number, like 100-1000), tf_i ... term frequency of word_i I am searching on current page Lets assume that n is usually 1-4 (I rarely search more than 4 words at once). Right now, all coefficients a_i are the same, but that does not satisfy my needs. I am looking for a math formula, that would meet my requirements 1) If page A contains all words I am searching it should have better rating than page B which contains only one searched word (which happens to have very high tf).
2) I dont want the coefficients to reach 0 even if the page contains only one of all the words I am searching - page A with one word_i should have better rating than page B with no searched words at all. In other words- I would like for a coefficient $a_i$ to depend on $tf_j$, where $i \ne j$. EXAMPLE searched words: orange, banana, apple (Its a dumb example, I know - sorry) page A: 5 x orange, 1 x banana, 0 x apple (lets assume that all pages have the same amount of words in them) page B: 1x orange, 1 x banana, 1 x apple page C: 100 x orange, 0 x banana, 0 x apple page D: none of those I want to use my formula rating = tfidf + a_1*tf_1 + ... + a_n*tf_n so that B>A>C>D I would be glad for any ideas.

223606,Pole set of rational function defined on a variety,"The problem: Let $V = V(y^2-x^2(x+1))$, and let $\overline{x}, \overline{y}$ denote the $I(V)$-residues of $x$ and $y$ in the coordinate ring $\Gamma(V)$. Set $z=\overline{y}/\overline{x}$. Find the pole sets for $z$ and $z^2$. My progress: Since $I(V) = (y^2-x^2(x+1))$ (the polynomial $y^2-x^2(x+1)$ is irreducible), we have $\overline{y}^2 = \overline{x}^2(\overline{x} + \overline{1})$ in $\Gamma(V)$, so $$z=\overline{y}/\overline{x} = (\overline{x}/\overline{y})(\overline{x}+\overline{1})$$ and $$z^2 = \overline{y}^2/\overline{x}^2 = \overline{x} + \overline{1}.$$
Hence $z^2$ has no poles since one representation is a polynomial, and $z$ has no poles at $(x,y)$ if either $x\neq 0$ or $y\neq 0$. So I have concluded that the only possible pole for $z$ is $(0,0)$. However, I am unsure of how to check this point. I would appreciate any hints.",['algebraic-geometry']

I'm aware that there's a theorem which you can use that integrates the function using the points where the function can't be solved or something like that(improper integrals?) but I haven't learned anything but parts and substitution yet. I know that this integral can be solved using just those and that's what I am searching for =). Unfortunately, this is no homework (and my calculus teacher has no idea how to solve this... I asked =(   ). I just saw this integral by accident. I've been struggling with it for like a week now. I just want the answer and preferably the steps. Possible starting points: The best approach I could find is: $$u^2=3x \implies 2u\ du = 3\ dx$$ $$\frac{2}{3}\int \sqrt{ 1+\frac{1}{u^2} }  \, \, u\ du$$ $$\frac{2}{3}\int \sqrt{ u^2+1 }  \, \, du$$ Now I know that I can use sinh but I have no clue how. That was one approach that a guy told me. If you don't like it you could start with the more traditional way: $$u=3x$$ $$ \frac{1}{3} \int\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{u}}\,du.$$
Now $$w^2=1+\dfrac{1}{u}$$ 
$$2w\,dw=-\frac{du}{u^2}=-(w^2-1)^2 \,du.$$
$$\frac{1}{3}\int-\frac{2w^2\,dw}{(w^2-1)^2}.$$ After that I've been told that you could integrate by parts but it's just too hard for me. I simply get nowhere. I won't type everything cause it's a waste of time. If anyone wants me to type in more work I'd be happy to if it helps in any way. I'm in a stage where I just want to see how this super-complex (at least for me) integral is solved. I've used wolframalpha but it's nowhere near a human approach.

Through some research I have found out and understood the proof for why a poisson r.v. with gamma distributed mean is a negative binomial r.v. So at worst I think I could use the poisson to approximate the hypergeometric, and thus the negative binomial result should work to approximate the hypergeometric with a gamma random number of draws (unless I am thinking about this completely wrong).

But why doesn't the definition of extension fields take into account up to an isomorphism (since technically $F$ is not a subset of $E$ in this case) when we talk about a field $E$ being an extension of a field $F$?

224933,generalized MRRW bound on the asymptotic rate of q-ary codes,"Among the many upper bounds for families of codes in $\mathbb F _2 ^n$, the best known bound is the one by McEliece, Rodemich, Rumsey and Welch (MRRW) which states that the rate $R(\delta)$ corresponding to a relative distance of $\delta$ is such that:
\begin{equation*}R(\delta) \leq H_2(\frac{1}{2}-\sqrt{\delta(1-\delta)}) \end{equation*}
where H is the (binary) entropy function.
(A slight improvement of the above exists in the binary case, but within the same framework)
In the case of q-ary codes, i.e. codes over $\mathbb F _q ^n$, the above bound is generalized to:

My question is as follows:
For larger alphabet size q, the above bound seems to weaken significantly. In fact, observing the growth of the above bound as $q \rightarrow \infty$ (using simple approximations of entropy), we see that:
\begin{equation*} R(\delta) \leq 1-\delta+\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\log{q}})  \end{equation*}
Thus, it seems to get worse than even the Singleton bound $R(\delta) \leq 1-\delta$. So which is the best bound for large alphabet size $q$? Or am I wrong in the above conclusion (most sources claim the MRRW bound stated above is the best known bound, but its not clear if that holds for larger q as well).
Also, could someone direct me to references for comparisons of different bounds for larger $q$? I am able to find reliable comparisons only for $q=2$.","['coding-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'discrete-geometry', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'combinatorics']"

224937,Antiholomorphic (Co)Tangent Space/Bundle,"So, I have a question concerning $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ (defined below) when $X$ is a Riemann Surface. Let me give a little bit of background to whet your appetite (for question answering!) Background So, we are dealing with a Riemann Surface $X$ (a connected complex manifold of dimension one). Given a point $x\in X$ we can form the holomorphic cotangent bundle at $x$ , denoted $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ for me, as follows: start by considering holomorphic function elements $(f,U)$ at $x$ --namely, $U$ is some neighborhood of $x$ , and $f\in\mathcal{O}(U)$ (holomorphic functions on $U$ ). We denote the set of all such function elements at $x$ by $\mathcal{H}_x$ . We can then define an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{H}_x$ by declaring that $(f,U)\sim(g,V)$ if $f\mid_W=g\mid_W$ for some open neighborhood $W\subseteq U\cap V$ of $x$ . The set of equivalence classes of $\mathcal{H}_x/\sim$ will be denoted $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ --called the holomorphic germs at $x$ . We then define an equivalence relation on the germs, by saying that two germs $f$ and $g$ at $x$ (domains are unimportant) are equivalent if $(f\circ z^{-1})'(z(x))=(g\circ z^{-1})'(z(x))$ for some chart $(z,U)$ at $x$ . We denote the quotient of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ by this equivalence relation as $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ and call it, as I've already said, the holomorphic cotangent bundle at $x$ . We denote the equivalence class of $f$ in $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ as $df(x)$ . $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ carries a well-defined vector space structure which is defined (and it is well-defined!) by $df(x)+\lambda dg(x)=d(f+\lambda g)(x)$ . We can then glue all of the holomorphic cotangent spaces together to get the holomorphic cotangent bundle $T_X^{\ast1,0}$ which is a holomorphic line bundle with local trivilizations $\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbb{C}:cdz(x)\mapsto (x,c)$ (where, as usual, $(z,U)$ is a chart on $X$ -- $\{dz(x)\}$ forms a basis of $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ so this makes sense) and transition functions $t_{\alpha\beta}=(z_\beta\circ z_\alpha^{-1})')\circ z_\alpha$ . Ok, so that's all fine. It makes one-hundred percent sense to me--both symbolically and intuitively. The issue then comes in with defining $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . I understand it symbolically, it's just the tangent bundle one gets by conjugating the holomorphic cotangent bundles transition functions. The issue is with the intuition. The holomorphic tangent and cotangent bundle were defined so concretely, it would be nice to have a concrete description of $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . After a little bit of thought, it seems that there is a very natural/concrete way to define $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . Namely, perform almost the exact same procedure one did with the holomorphic cotangent bundle except one replaces holomorphic germs with antiholomorphic germs (i.e. replace normal holomorphic functions $f:X\to\mathbb{C}$ with functions whose conjugate is holomorphic) and replace all the derivatives with respect to $z$ , to derivatives with respect to $\bar{z}$ . Now, I'm fairly convinced that this is all kosher, but it begs two questions: a) why isn't this the definition, why is the definition via just transition functions favorable and b) $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ is not a holomorphic line bundle, but it's damn close--it's some kind of ""antiholomorphic line bundle""--does this idea hold any significance?

I am guessing the geometric obstruction lies in the non-smoothness at the origin, which makes $(x,z)^2$ not a ""real"" infinitesimal neighborhood around the origin, but again I don't know how to make this precise.

The wikipedia page was not very helpful for me. I would be very happy if someone could give me a non-rigorous idea about what exactly the difference is. My background involves basic differential geometry. I have also done some very basic differential topology and am aware of manifolds and some topological properties associated with them. I'll try and elaborate a bit about the context. The Frenet frame fields are useful in that they express the rate of change of the unit vectors constituting the frame in terms of the vectors themselves. Also the fact that it is a ""moving frame"" is supposedly useful. I am thinking, this means analysis of the various properties associated with the curve is easier as the frame moves along with the observer.Though I couldn't explicitly point out what these properties are. Am I right?? Why exactly is this frame so useful??Also doesn't the notion of a frame reject path independence? I apologise if my question seems a bit vague. I do hope its enough to convey what I am looking for.
I am not much exposed to physics. But I would welcome answers involving examples from physics if it helps matters.

225255,Constructing a triangle given three concurrent cevians?,"Well, I've been taught how to construct triangles given the $3$ sides, the $3$ angles and etc. This question came up and the first thing I wondered was if the three altitudes (medians, concurrent$^\text {any}$ cevians in general) of a triangle are unique for a particular triangle. I took a wild guess and I assumed Yes! Now assuming my guess is correct, I have the following questions How can I construct a triangle given all three altitudes , medians or/and any three concurrent cevians, if it is possible? N.B: If one looks closely at the order  in which I wrote the question(the cevians coming last), the altitudes and the medians are special cases of concurrent cevians with properties The altitudes form an angle of $90°$ with the sides each of them touch. The medians bisect the side each of them touch. With these properties it will be easier to construct the equivalent triangles (which I still don't know how) but with just any concurrent cevians, what other unique property can be added to make the construction possible? For example the angle they make with the sides  they touch ($90°$ in the case of altitudes) or the ratio in which they divide the sides they touch ($1:1$ in the case of medians) or any other property for that matter. EDIT What André has shown below is a perfect example of three concurrent cevians forming two different triangles, thus given the lengths of three concurrent cevians, these cevians don't necessarily define a unique triangle. But also note that the altitudes of the equilateral triangle he defined are perpendicular to opposite sides while for the isosceles triangle, the altitude is, obviously also perpendicular to the opposite side with the remaining two cevians  form approximately an angle of $50°$ with each opposite sides. Also note that the altitudes of the equilateral triangle bisects the opposite sides and the altitude of the isosceles triangle bisects its opposite sides while the remaining two cevians divides the opposite sides, each in the ratio $1:8$. Now, given these additional properties (like the ratio of ""bisection"" or the angle formed with opposite sides) of these cevians, do they form a unique triangle (I'm assuming yes on this one) and if yes, how can one construct that unique triangle with a pair of compasses, a ruler and a protractor?","['geometry', 'triangles', 'geometric-construction']"

When $\nu_1$ is absolutely continuous to $\nu_2$ then, by the Radon-Nykodim Theorem, the map $M$ can be given explicitly, i.e. there exists a $\Sigma$-measurable function $f:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb R$, such that $M(g):=f\cdot g$ will satisfy the equation given above.

225406,How does this prove that P(k) of every k is true?,"This is an example from my textbook. I'm very rusty with simplifying algebraic expression so i hope you'll forgive me for that. The textbook says there are two rules to Mathematical Induction: 1) We must first prove that $P(1)$ is true. 2) We must then assume that $P(k)$ is true and prove that $P(k+1)$ is true. Show that if n is a positive integer, then
$1 + 2+· · ·+n =\frac{ n(n + 1)}
2$ For the inductive hypothesis we assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary
positive integer k. That is, we assume that $1 + 2+· · ·+k = \frac{k(k + 1)}  2$
. Under this assumption, it must be shown that P(k + 1) is true, namely, that
$1 + 2+· · ·+k + (k + 1) =\frac {(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)}
2= \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}
2$ is also true. When we add $k + 1$ to both sides of the equation in P(k), we obtain $1 + 2+· · ·+k + (k + 1)
 =\frac{k(k + 1)}
2
+ (k + 1)
= \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}

. This last equation shows that P(k + 1) is true under the assumption that P(k) is true. This
completes the inductive step. My question is how this proves that $P(k+1)$ is true? Also, why does textbook add $k+1$ to both sides of the equation?","['induction', 'algebra-precalculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"

From Wikipedia: Let A be an $m \times n$ matrix and $b$ an $m$-dimensional vector. Then, exactly one of the following two statements is true: There exists an $x \in \Bbb R^n$ such that $Ax = b$ and $x \ge 0$. There exists a $y \in \Bbb R^m$ such that $A^Ty \ge 0$ and $b^Ty < 0$. The first direction is quite easy. I assume that there is a vector $y$ and I found a contradiction.
To the other direction I have used the fourier-motzkin elimination to reduce the number of variables. I assume that $Ax \le b$ and I do one step from the algorithm. I create a new system $A'x' \le b'$. I know that there exist a non-negative matrix $M$ that is a linear combination of the new system to the original. I have followed the direction of repeating the algorithm $n$ times to eliminate all the variables and create the system: $0 \le b''$. Now in order this system to be infeasible it must be that: $b''<0$. So I can assume that exist vector $y''$ such that $y''A''=0$ and also $y''b''<0$ because $b'<0$ and $y\ge 0$. Now I can prove that also there is a vector $y$ for the original system. But the repetition of $n$ steps seems to me a bit arbitrary.

225490,tangents of infinite sums --- reference request,"This section of Wikipedia's List of trigonometric identities was, as far as I know, written entirely by me.  For a time, it dealt only with finite sums, and said something like this:
$$
\tan(\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_n) = \frac{e_1-e_3+e_5-\cdots}{e_0-e_2+e_4-\cdots}\tag{1}
$$
where $e_k$ is the $k$th-degree elementary symmetric polynomial in the variables $\tan\theta_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, and the number of terms on the right depends on the number of terms on the left. An obvious question was whether this works with infinite sums, and I've thought only about the absolutely convergent case.  In that case, the numerator and denominator would each have infinitely many terms.  But if you're thinking about $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ of the expression on the left, then notice that as $n$ grows, each term $e_k$ on the left changes.  Thinking about that seemed moderately icky and I left it alone until this point of view occurred to me: We have two trigonometric identities
$$
e_0-e_2+e_4-\cdots =\frac{\sec\theta_1\sec\theta_2\sec\theta_3\cdots}{\sec(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3+\cdots)}\tag{even}

(The second one has secants in the numerator and cosecants in the denominator, so it's an odd function, like the expression on the left.)  If $\sum_i\theta_i$ converges absolutely, then it's not hard to show that the expressions on the right converge as the number of terms grows, therefore so do the expressions on the left. Then finally,
$$
\frac{(\mathrm{odd})}{\mathrm{(even)}} = \frac{\sec}{\csc} = \tan
$$

At the end of the proof, I found myself quite confused, and had to look carefully at the build-up to see how the conclusion followed. I get the steps, now - but not the intuition. The authors took sets $X$ and $Y$ and assumed injections $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $g: Y \rightarrow X$. Since $X \sim g[f[X]]$ and $X \supseteq g[Y] \supseteq g[f[X]]$, and $Y \sim g[Y]$, the authors went to prove the lemma that $A \sim A_1, A \supseteq B \supseteq A_1 \implies A \sim B$. For the lemma, they defined recursive sequences $\{A_n\}_{n \in \omega}, \{B_n\}_{n \in \omega}$ by $A_0 = A, A_{n+1} = f[A],$ $ B_0 = B, B_{n+1} = f[B].$ Since $A_0 \supseteq B_0 \supseteq A_1 \implies f[A_0] \supseteq f[B_0] \supseteq f[A_1]$, we get from induction that $A_{n+1} \subseteq A_n$. Putting $\{C_n\}_{n \in \omega} = \{A_n - B_n\}_{n \in \omega},$ they noted that $C_{n+1} = f[C_n]$ (since $A_n \supseteq B_n$ inductively, $f[A_n - B_n] = f[A_n] - f[B_n]$). Putting $$ C = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty C_n, \text{   } D = A - C,$$ they noted that $f[C] = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty C_n$, and that $h(x): A \rightarrow f[C] \cup D$ can be defined by sending $x \in C \rightarrow f(x),$ and $x \in D \rightarrow x$. It is clear that $h$ is one-to-one and onto. Inductively, for $n > 0$, $C_0 \cap C_n = \varnothing$; it follows that $C_0 \cap \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty C_n = C_0 \cap f[C] = \varnothing$. We know that $C_0 \cup f[C] \cup D$ = A, and since all three sets are disjoint, we may conclude that $f[C] \cup D = A - C_0 = A - (A - B) = B$. Thus, our bijection $h$ maps $A$ to $B$, as we wanted. What is the intuition here? What were H&J, or Cantor, Bernstein, etc. thinking when they went to prove this - the ""high-level"" idea? Is there a clearer proof, in the sense of thought process (not necessarily shorter)?","['intuition', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

225621,A nonlinear version of the Riesz isomorphism,"The present question regards the proof of the following theorem which is found in Adams' Sobolev spaces , §2.30 - 2.33. Here $(\Omega, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ denotes some arbitrary measure space and $L^p$ always stands for $L^p(\Omega)$. Riesz Representation Theorem Let $1<p<\infty$ and let $p'=p/(p-1)$. For any $v \in L^{p'}$ denote $L_v$ to be the linear functional on $L^p$ defined by the following equation:
  $$\langle L_v, w\rangle =\int_{\Omega} vw\, d\mu.$$
  Then the mapping $v\mapsto L_v$ is an isometric isomorphism of $L^{p'}$ onto $[L^p]^\star$. The most interesting thing to prove is that this mapping $L$ is surjective, which as far as I know is usually done by means of the Radon-Nikodym's theorem of measure theory. On the contrary, Adams' book employs uniform convexity of $L^p$ space and two of the four Clarkson's inequalities, precisely:
$$\tag{38} \forall u, v \in L^p, 2\le p <\infty,\quad \left\lVert \frac{u+v}{2}\right\rVert_p^{p'}+\left\lVert \frac{u-v}{2}\right\rVert_p^{p'}\ge\left( \frac{1}{2}\lVert u \rVert_p^p+\frac{1}{2}\lVert v\rVert_p^p\right)^{p'-1}, $$
$$\tag{40} \forall u, v \in L^p, 1< p \le 2,\quad \left\lVert \frac{u+v}{2}\right\rVert_p^{p}+\left\lVert \frac{u-v}{2}\right\rVert_p^{p}\ge \frac{1}{2}\lVert u \rVert_p^p+\frac{1}{2}\lVert v\rVert_p^p. $$
His proof follows those steps: Because of uniform convexity, there exists a duality mapping $$\left[ F\in \left( L^p\right)^\star \right] \to \left[\text{the unique}\ w\in L^p\ \text{s.t.}\ \lVert w\rVert_p=\lVert F \rVert_\star\ \text{and}\ \langle F, w\rangle=\lVert F\rVert_\star^2\right].$$ The duality mapping has an explicitly known left inverse $$\left[ L_v\in (L^p)^\star\ \text{where}\ v=\frac{\lvert w\rvert^{p-1}\text{signum}(w)}{\left(\int \lvert w\rvert^p\,d\mu\right)^{\frac{p-2}{p}}}\right] \leftarrow \left[ w\in L^p\right].$$ Because of inequalities (38) and (40), the duality mapping is injective. This means that the duality mapping is bijective and so, in particular, that any linear functional $T$ is of the form $L_v$, which is what Adams wanted to prove. However, it seems to me that he actually proved much more than that: namely, this proof introduces the duality mapping, which is (as far as I can understand) a generalization of the Riesz isomorphism between a Hilbert space and its dual. Also, it looks like this mapping only depends on some easily generalizable properties of $L^p$ such as uniform convexity. So: Question How much is it known about the duality mapping in an abstract Banach space? What are the minimal hypotheses that guarantee its existence? In what spaces has it got an explicit analytical expression? Thank you for reading.","['riesz-representation-theorem', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
225623,"Divergence of $\sum\limits_n1/\max(a_n,b_n)$","Given two positive and (strictly) monotone increasing sequences, $a_n$ and $b_n$ such that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac1{a_n}$ and $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac1{b_n}$ diverge, does $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac1{\max(a_n,b_n)}$ diverge? For sequences, where $a_n > b_n$ or $a_n < b_n$ eventually, the result follows immediately. But I am unable to see what happens when $a_n$ and $b_n$ take turns to overtake each other as $n \to \infty$? Essentially this question stems from the question, Osgood condition , where I wanted to consider the function $F(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ and lower bound $\displaystyle \int\dfrac{dy}{F(y)}$ by $\displaystyle \int \dfrac{dy}{2\max(h(y),g(y))}$ in an attempt to show that $\displaystyle \int\dfrac{dy}{F(y)}$ diverges.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
