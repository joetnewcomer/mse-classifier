4905202,"Given that $\sin x+\sin3x +\sin5x = 1$, $\cos x +\cos3x +\cos5x = \sqrt{2} + 1$, find the value of $\tan3x$. Are there any mistakes in this topic?","Given the equations: $$\sin x + \sin 3x + \sin 5x = 1,$$ $$\cos x + \cos 3x + \cos 5x = \sqrt{2} + 1,$$ we are asked to find the value of $\tan 3x$ . Firstly, let's use the sum-to-product formulas for sine and cosine: For sine: $$\sin A + \sin B = 2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right),$$ For cosine: $$\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right).$$ Applying these to our equations, we get: For the first equation: $$\sin x + \sin 5x = 2\sin\left(\frac{x+5x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{x-5x}{2}\right) = 2\sin(3x)\cos(-2x) = 2\sin(3x)\cos(2x),$$ and thus: $$2\sin(3x)\cos(2x) + \sin 3x = 1.$$ For the second equation: $$\cos x + \cos 5x = 2\cos\left(\frac{x+5x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{x-5x}{2}\right) = 2\cos(3x)\cos(-2x) = 2\cos(3x)\cos(2x),$$ and thus: $$2\cos(3x)\cos(2x) + \cos 3x = \sqrt{2} + 1.$$ Now we solve for $\sin(3x)$ and $\cos(3x)$ : From the first equation: $$2\sin(3x)\cos(2x) + \sin 3x = 1,$$ $$\Rightarrow \sin 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1) = 1.$$ From the second equation: $$2\cos(3x)\cos(2x) + \cos 3x = \sqrt{2} + 1,$$ $$\Rightarrow \cos 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1) = \sqrt{2} + 1.$$ Dividing the two equations to eliminate $\cos(2x)$ , we get: $$\frac{\sin 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1)}{\cos 3x (2\cos(2x) + 1)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \frac{\sin 3x}{\cos 3x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \tan 3x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1}.$$ To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $(\sqrt{2} - 1)$ : $$\tan 3x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1},$$ $$\Rightarrow \tan 3x = \sqrt{2} - 1.$$ That's the process of doing it by hand. However, using mathematica software to calculate the value of tan3x, the result is no solution. Is there a mistake in the question?",['trigonometry']

4905209,Strange usage of chain rule. Can anyone explain why this derivation was done this way?,"There are 2 issues I have with the way this was done. The first was how chain rule was used in the (1.35), and the second was how chain rule was used in (1.36). It all seems so counterintuitive. For (1.35), to start I tried plugging for the initial equation, but without known values for $\delta p$ , I can't use it to verify this equation. So, I attempted to obtain it using chain rule, and doesn't make a lot of sense the way I'm assuming it was done. Unless I'm just blatantly abusing chain rule, this result just doesn't seem possible. Trying to do this a bit more intuitively: Transform 1: $p(x,z) = g(x,z) \therefore z = z(x,z)$ (pretty sure we can't do this) $$\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$$ It's my understanding that we could also abuse chain rule here and say $\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial n_i}\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial k_i} = \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial k_i}$ , otherwise we're saying that z is a function of x when it just plainly isn't. When and Why would we choose to abuse chain rule like this? Drop the functions to get a definition for the differential operator $$\tag{1}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}  = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$$ Second transformation: $p(x,z) = h(x,s) \therefore s = s(x,z)$ (THIS would be a proper usage of transforming a variable and then applying chain rule, but why do it here rather than at the beginning?) $$\frac{\partial h}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial s}\frac{\partial s}{\partial z}$$ Drop the functions to get a differential operator to substitute into (1) $$\tag{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial s}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}$$ And then plugging in (2) into (1) and applying the derivative to the original function $p$ would give: $$\tag{5} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial s}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial p}{\partial s}$$ I have no idea why we couldn't have just instead done $p(x,z) = g(x,s) \therefore s = s(x,z)$ at the very beginning and then done $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial s}\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}$ , nor do I understand why this would be incorrect whereas we would consider (1.36) correct. Does anyone understand why it was done this way?","['multivariable-calculus', 'chain-rule']"
4905222,How did Jacobi find his connection between theta functions and $q$?,"I was 'reading' (I can't actually read german, but I can read math!) Jacobi's derivation of the ODE for $y(q) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} q^{n^2} $ . On page 2 of the paper Jacobi states the following as an axiom of sorts that was considered to be obvious at the time. I am asking how to prove and see this result. The result is if $$ y(k) = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^2 (\varphi)}} }  $$ and $$ \ln \left( \frac{1}{q(k)} \right) = \pi \frac{ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\varphi)+k^2 \sin^2(\varphi)}}}{ \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^2(\varphi)}}} $$ Then $$y(k) = 1 + 2q(k) + 2q(k)^4 + 2q(k)^9 ... \rightarrow y = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} q^{n^2} $$ So I tried to derive this the usual way anyone in 1846 would. I went to my copy of mathematica on a new macbook pro and implemented: y[k_] = Sqrt[2/Pi * Integrate[1/Sqrt[1 - k^2 * Sin[s]^2], {s, 0, Pi/2}]] 
Q[k_] = Exp[-Pi *( Integrate[  1/Sqrt[Cos[s]^2 + k^2 Sin[s]^2], {s, 0, Pi/2}]/
 Integrate[  1/Sqrt[1 - k^2 Sin[s]^2], {s, 0, Pi/2}] )] And then attempted to compute the series via the techniques here Series[y[InverseFunction[Q][k]], {k, 0, 10}] To my great surprise, after 10 minutes, there was no answer. Whatever Mathematica was computing was simply NOT converging. So I am quite spooked now. If my CAS can't handle this, how on earth did Jacobi manage to find and verify this result back in the day? And why is this considered obvious? I can't find a citation for this in the text, he just starts here and then picks up. If anyone can enlighten me on how this can be derived by hand I would be very grateful. For those that want to find Jacobi's work, the work in particular is cited as  K. G. J. Jacobi, J. Reine Angew. Math. ( = Crelleâ€™s Journal.) 36 (1847), 97-112 in Richard Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Volume 2 Page 282. And can be found here .

4905257,Prove a Result about Optimization and Exponential Distribution: Intuitive but Challenging,"Let $v=(v_1,v_2,...v_N)$ be a random vector with $N$ elements. $v_i \perp v_j$ for any $i\neq j$ . For each $i$ , the CDF of $v_i$ is: $F_i(v_i)=1-e^{-(v_i-a_i)/\theta}$ , where $v_i\in [a_i,\infty)$ . Assume $0<\theta<a_1<a_2<...<a_N$ and $c>0$ . Let $x(v)=(x_1(v),x_2(v)...x_N(v))$ be the solution of the following problem \begin{equation}
\max_{x(v)} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (v_i-\theta- cx_i)
\end{equation} subject to $x_i\geq 0$ for all $i$ , and $\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i\leq1$ . Since $v$ is random, $x(v)$ is also a random vector. Prove : $\mathbb{E}(x_N)-\mathbb{E}(x_1)$ is a decreasing function of $c$ . My attempts : This result is quite intuitive and I've verified using MATLAB for different parameters. If $N=2$ , this can be proved. The solution for each $x_i$ is the following: if $\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{v_i-\theta}{2c}\leq1$ , then $x_i=\frac{v_i-\theta}{2c}$ ; if $\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{v_i-\theta}{2c}>1$ , then $x_i=\frac{[v_i-\theta-\lambda(v)]^+}{2c}$ , and $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i=1$ for some Lagrange multiplier $\lambda(v)>0$ . Note that $\lambda$ is symmetric, i.e., $\lambda(v_i,v_j,v_{-{i,j}})$ = $\lambda(v_j,v_i,v_{-{i,j}})$ for all $i\neq j$ . I think the challenge is the $[\quad]^+$ sign in the solution of $x_i$ , if we remove this, the result is obviuosly true. But the $[\quad]^+$ sign makes it messy. Maybe Mathematical Induction is useful, I've tried, but still didn't prove it.","['convex-optimization', 'exponential-distribution', 'probability']"
4905319,Subset of a conjugacy class of of an odd permutation in $S_n$,"Let $\sigma=(1,2,3,\dots,n)$ be an odd $n-$ cycle in $S_n$ (so $n$ is even). It is known that the size of its conjugacy class is $|cl_{S_n}(\sigma)|=(n-1)!$ . I am interested in the size of the subset $S=cl_{cl_{S_n}(\sigma)}(\sigma)$ , that is, the set of all the $n-$ cycles that we can obtain by conjugating $\sigma$ only with elements in its conjugacy class. In particular, I would like to show that $S$ contains at least $|cl_{S_n}(\sigma)|/2=(n-1)!/2$ elements, which happens to seem true in the numerical experiments I run. Approaches I tried: Construct enough elements by hand. I found this trick: If we conjugate $\sigma=(1,2,3,\dots,n)$ by $(1, a_1, 3, a_3, 5, a_5, \dots, 4, a_4, 2, a_2, n)$ for a free choice of the $a_i$ in the set of the remaining half symbols, we obtain a permutation sending $(1,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,\dots,a_{n/2-1},\dots)$ . This way it is possible to produce explicitly some mutually different elements, but still not enough. By elementary group theory, two elements $\alpha,\beta\in S$ are such that $\alpha\sigma\alpha^{-1}=\beta\sigma\beta^{-1}$ if and only if $\beta=\alpha\sigma^k$ for some even power $k$ of $\sigma$ . This way we obtain that $S$ contains at least $\frac{(n-1)!}{n/2-1}$ elements, still too few, unfortunately, due to the denominator depending on $n$ (but observe that this case solves the case $n=6$ ). Notes: The fact that we are choosing as $\sigma$ that particular odd cycle is just a simplification of the original problem. This claim still seems to be true for any odd permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ for every $n$ big enough to contain $\sigma$ . I feel that this problem is not impossible, and just a clever simple counting trick is needed.

Then the equation $\phi (x)=m$ $(\ast)$ has finitely many solutions over $\mathbb N$ . Proof . Consider $\cal L_m \subseteq \mathbb N$ the set of all solutions of $(\ast)$ and assume by way of contradiction that $\cal L_m$ is infinite. Now, take $x \in \cal L_m$ . Thus, $f(x) \leq \phi (x)=m$ , and so $1 \leq x=g(f(x)) \leq g(m)$ . Therefore, $\cal L_m$ is bounded, impossible, q.e.d. Now, my question is whether this trivial result has already been discovered. Lastly, I'd like to present some examples of this lemma. Example 1 Consider $Ï†$ to be the Euler totient function.

4905672,"Is time-orientability a condition on the metric, smooth or topological structure of a manifold?","I recently asked a question on Physics Stack Exchange about orientability and time-orientability of a manifold in the language of fiber bundles. This new question is related to, but independent, of that one. Orientability of an $n$ -dimensional manifold (for example in the sense that there is an everywhere non-vanishing smooth $n$ -form) is a topological property of manifolds. This can be seen through the theory of characteristic classes and the fact that it is equivalent to the first Stiefelâ€“Whitney class of the manifold vanishing. Time-orientability can be defined by requiring that there is an everywhere non-vanishing timelike vector on the manifold (which immediately makes use of the metric structure in order to define what ""timelike"" means). Alternatively, one can define a manifold is time-orientable if the bundle of orthonormal frames $\mathrm{O}(M)$ admits a reduction to an $\mathrm{O}^+(M)$ subbundle under the inclusion $\mathrm{O}^+(s,t) \subseteq \mathrm{O}(s,t)$ . My question is: when we say that a Lorentzian (or, more generally, pseudo-Riemannian) manifold $(M,g)$ is time-orientable, is this a restriction on the metric structure $(M,g)$ , on the smooth structure of $M$ , or on the topology of $M$ ?","['semi-riemannian-geometry', 'mathematical-physics', 'general-relativity', 'characteristic-classes', 'differential-geometry']"

The exercise is Tao Analysis I 4thed ex 3.5.9 Suppose that $I$ and $J$ are two sets, and for all $\alpha \in I$ let $A_{\alpha}$ be a set, and for all $\beta \in J$ let $B_{\beta}$ be a set. Show that $$(\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \cap (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta}) = \bigcup_{(\alpha,\beta) \in I \times J} (A_{\alpha} \cap B_{\beta})$$ What happens if one interchanges all the union and intersection symbols here? Note: I wanted to show this using a series of $\iff$ statements and not the more verbose proving both inclusions $\implies$ and $\impliedby$ . Let's start with the LHS. $$x \in (\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \cap (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta}) \iff x \in (\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \land x \in (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta})$$ Using the definition of the union of sets, this means both of the following are true: $x$ is an element of at least one $A_{\alpha}$ , let's call one of them $A_{\alpha'}$ $x$ is an element of at least one $B_{\beta}$ , let's call one of them $B_{\beta'}$ This gives us $$\begin{align}x \in (\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \cap (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta}) &\iff x \in A_{\alpha'} \land x \in B_{\beta'} \\ \\ & \iff x \in A_{\alpha'} \cap B_{\beta'} \\ \\ & \iff x \in \bigcup_{(\alpha,\beta) \in I \times J} (A_{\alpha} \cap B_{\beta})\end{align}$$ Thus, we have shown $$(\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \cap (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta}) = \bigcup_{(\alpha,\beta) \in I \times J} (A_{\alpha} \cap B_{\beta}) \; \square$$ My Doubt 1 My doubts are in using the specific $A_{\alpha'}$ and $B_{\beta'}$ which we know exist . For example, consider the following: $$x \in (\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}) \cap (\bigcup_{\beta \in J} B_{\beta}) \iff x \in A_{\alpha'} \land x \in B_{\beta'}$$ If the LHS is true we know there must exist an $A_{\alpha'}$ such that $x \in A_{\alpha'}$ , and similarly there must exist a $B_{\beta'}$ such that $x \in B_{\beta'}$ . Now consider the RHS $x \in A_{\alpha'} \land x \in B_{\beta'}$ . If this is true, then I would argue that the LHS is true because the argument "" $x \in P \implies x \in P \cup Q$ for any set $Q$ "" is generalisable as "" $x \in A_{\alpha'} \implies x \in \bigcup A_\alpha$ "". Am I right? My Doubt 2 My next doubt arises from the following statement: $$x \in A_{\alpha'} \cap B_{\beta'} \iff x \in \bigcup_{(\alpha,\beta) \in I \times J} (A_{\alpha} \cap B_{\beta})$$ The nature of my doubt is the same as Doubt 1.","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"
4905730,Smoothest car trip,"I was thinking about the trajectory of a car over time from a point $A$ to $B$ and what would be the motion that would feel most smooth for a passenger. If we consider the position as a function of time to be $$\vec{s}(t) = \vec{s_0}+f(t/T) \Delta\vec{s}$$ Where $\vec{s_0}$ is the initial position, $T$ the total travel time and $\Delta\vec{s}$ the difference between the final position and initial position. Then, $f(x)$ will be a function that dictates how ""smooth"" the car trip will be. But to more rigorously define it, its properties should be (in the interval $[0,1]$ ): $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$ $\frac{d^{n}f}{dx^{n}}=0$ for all $n \geq 1$ at $x=0$ and $x=1$ (The car is absolutely at rest in the beginning and at the end) $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing $f(x+1/2)-1/2$ is an odd function (it is ""symmetric"" with respect to the midpoint of the interval $x=1/2$ ) The maximum value of $|\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}|$ is minimized (minimize the acceleration felt by the passenger) It is ""easy"" to find a function that satisfies the first 5 properties. This video , for example, offers this function: $$f(x) = \frac{e^{-1/x}}{e^{-1/x}+e^{-1/(1-x)}}$$ However, can there be a function with a smaller maximum acceleration/2nd derivative? For this particular function above, the maximum value is quite high, at $9.841$ when $x=0.218$ , and, on a side note, it would provide a very bad car trip! For a 60km trip that takes 60 minutes, it would take more than 6 minutes just to reach 1km/h! Edit: After seeing @Alex K answer, I noticed that the 1st derivative is very similar to a triangle. In fact, it seems to me to be the case that if it is indeed a triangle, the maximum 2nd derivative would be minimized and be equal to 4. So, the 2nd derivative would be 4 from 0 to 1/2 and then -4 from 1/2 to 1. This results in this function: $$f(x) = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
  2x^2, x\leq\frac{1}{2} \\
  -2x^2 + 4x - 1, x > \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
\right.$$ This function doesn't satisfy all the properties and as such is not physically realistic, but does seem to imply that the lower bound for the smallest maximum 2nd derivative of $f(x)$ is 4.","['optimization', 'calculus', 'functions', 'continuity']"

In the image below:
The green dot is the focus of the parabola and the green line is the guide of the parabola. The blue dot is the midpoint between the centers of the two circles. The blue line is the radical axis of the two circles. The red and purple dots represent the centers and points of contact of the two circles.
The four dimensions between points on the axis of symmetry and between lines of the same color are equal This is my proof using coordinate geometry in Arabic: In the last image, it shows how you took advantage of the property to create a circle passing through a known point and touching a parabola at two points (there are two of these circles).","['conic-sections', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"
4905838,Can this integral equation be solved?,"I am trying to find out the Stationary Distribution of a Continuous State Space Markov Chain. For example, consider a Gaussian Transition Kernel that describes the probability of moving from point $x$ to $x'$ : $$T(x, x') \sim N(x, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$ I am interested in determining what is the Stationary Distribution for this process. I know that to determine the Stationary Distribution for this problem, we have to find a distribution $\pi(x)$ such that the following relationship holds (Detailed Balance Condition, also called the Reversibility Condition): $$\int T(x, x')\pi(x)dx = \pi(x'), \quad \forall x'$$ Is it possible to solve the above equation for $\pi(x)$ ? I know that in the context of Discrete Time and Discrete State Space Markov Chains, we can find the Stationary Distribution $\pi$ by solving the following equation: $$\pi = P \cdot \pi$$ However, I am not sure how to solve the equivalent equation for the Continuous State Space version. Here is what I tried so far. 1) Intuition When dealing with functions of the Gaussian Distribution, properties of the Gaussian Functions tend to also be Gaussian. This makes me believe that if the Stationary Distribution exists, it also Gaussian. I know that the Gaussian Distribution is symmetric around the mean ( Proof that the gaussian distribution is ""symmetric"". ), i.e. $f(x) = f(-x)$ . This means: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = f(-x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(-x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$ I thought of the following way to show this: If the Gaussian Distribution is symmetric around the mean point $\mu$ , this means that any two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ that are equidistant from $\mu$ will have the following properties: $$x_1 - \mu = \mu - x_2$$ $$\mu = \frac{x_1 +x_2}{2}$$ $$f(x_1) = f(x_2)$$ $$f(\mu + \Delta) = f(\mu - \Delta)$$ Symmetry using this condition implies that: $$ \exp\left[ - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x_2 - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] $$ Looking at the LHS, we see: $$ \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x_1 - \frac{{x_1 + x_2}}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] =  \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\frac{2x_1 - (x_1 + x_2)}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\frac{x_1 - x_2)}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{ 
 {x_1 - x_2)}}   {2\cdot\sigma}\right)^2\right]$$ Now, the same is true for the RHS: $$ \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x_2 - \frac{{x_1 + x_2}}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] =  \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\frac{2x_2 - (x_1 + x_2)}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\frac{x_1 - x_2)}{2}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right] = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{ 
 {x_1 - x_2)}}   {2\cdot\sigma}\right)^2\right]$$ Thus, we can see that LHS = RHS and that the Gaussian Distribution is symmetric around the mean. Going back to the Detailed Balance Condition, we can see that: $$\pi(x)T(x, x') = \pi(x')T(x', x)$$ Thus, if we assume that $\pi(x)$ is a Gaussian, we can write: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-x')^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$ Using the fact that the Gaussian distribution is symmetric, i.e $e^{-\frac{(x'-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = e^{-\frac{(x-x')^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ , we can write: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}}$$ Thus, based on the assumption that $\pi(x)$ is Gaussian, we can show that $\pi(x)$ satisfies the Detailed Balance Condition and is a Stationary Distribution: $$\int T(x, x')\pi(x)dx = \pi(x'), \quad \forall x'$$ Substituting the Gaussian transition kernel $T(x, x')$ and assume $\pi(x)$ is a Gaussian distribution, we get: $$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}} dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}}, \quad \forall x'$$ $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu^2}}e^{-\frac{(x'-\mu)^2}{2\mu^2}}, \quad \forall x'$$ But this still has not been proved in my opinion. 2) Computer Simulation I tried to write a computer simulation in R (Programming Language) that simulates random draws from this Transition Kernel and then uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic to compare the EDF (empirical distribution function) to the theoretical CDF (cumulative distribution function) of a Normal Distribution. In my opinion, this might be able to show that the Stationary Distribution of this Transition Kernel is Gaussian. library(ggplot2)

The class of recursive sets Recset is defined as follows: Base case: The empty set $\varnothing$ is a Recset. Constructor step: If S is a nonempty set of Recsetâ€™s, then S is a Recset. What to prove Theorem 8.3.2. The class Recset of recursive sets is the same as the class of all
sets. Proof. Everything in Recset is a set by definition, so we need only show that every
set is in Recset. Suppose to the contrary that a set S is not in Recset. So S must have an ele-
ment $N_0$ that is not in Recset, since otherwise S would by definition be in Recset.
Likewise, $N_0$ must have an element $N_1$ that is not in Recset, and $N_1$ must have an
element $N_2$ that is not in Recset, and so on. So we have an infinite sequence $$
S \ni N_0 \ni N_1 \ni N_2 \ni \ldots
$$ Therefore the set $^8$ $$
T ::= \{S, N_0 , N_1 , N_2 , \ldots\}
$$ has no member-minimal element, in violation of Foundation. $^8$ A rigorous proof, which we are skipping, requires careful use of the Choice axiom to prove that
T is a set. I prove $T$ is one set as follows: Here let the family of sets be $U,S,N_{0,\cdots}$ where $U$ is the universal set.
Then let the choice function be $U\to S,S\to N_0,\cdots$ . Then $T$ is the indexed set . I have questions about the ""infinite sequence"" part of the proof. Suppose one set $S=\{1\}$ is not in Recset. Based on the Constructor step, since at each step we can only have elements from Recset and the Base case only has $\varnothing$ , then Recset should only have $\varnothing$ as its minimal unit similar to von Neumann ordinals . Let us follow the process in ""Proof"". Then $N_0=1$ . But now we can't proceed further since $1$ isn't one set .

But I have heard several people defend the idea that algebraic spaces are arguably more natural than (or at least as natural as) schemes as the ""basic objects"" of algebraic geometry. That makes me wonder if one could skip the middleman, and directly give a workable definition of algebraic spaces with no reference to schemes, and retrieve schemes as a suitable subcategory as an afterthought. The most logical way to do that would be to define algebraic spaces as certain presheaves on $\mathbf{CRing^{op}}$ , similar to the functor-of-points definition of schemes (where schemes are Zariski sheaves on $\mathbf{CRing^{op}}$ which are locally representable).

This means that there has to exist a polynomial time algorithm that thransforms any given matching counting problem into a bipartite graph matching counting problem. I thought that maybe given a graph $G=([2n],E)$ the matching counting problem for said graph could be solved by separating the problem into the $2nCn$ combinations of bipartite graphs that can be created with the vertices of $G$ . However, this method isn't polynomial right? I'm new to these terms so I might be wrong there or there might be a different algorithm. So my question is, why would solving the bipartite matching counting problem efficiently mean solving the matching counting problem efficiently?

4906038,Newton root finding and preserving automatic differentiation.,"I am applying Newton's root solving algorithm. Suppose the example problem below, solving for $g$ with fixed parameter, $s$ : $$ f(g;s) = g^2 - s = 0, \qquad g_{i+1}=g_i - \frac{f(g_i;s)}{\frac{df}{dg}(g_i;s)} $$ Clearly this has the solution: $$ g= \sqrt{s}, \qquad \frac{dg}{ds} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{s}}, \qquad \frac{d^2g}{ds^2} = \frac{-1}{4s^{3/2}}  $$ When you search for ""Newton Algorithm"" and ""Automatic Differentiation"", the majority of the results/papers reference applying automatic differentiation to determine the derivative, $\frac{df}{dg}(g_i;s)$ at each step in the interation. I am not interested in this. What I am interested in is a formal proof that the following process can capture the accurate resultant sensitivities (i.e. $\frac{dg}{ds}$ and $\frac{d^2g}{dx^2}$ : First converge to solution using floating point arithmetic. Perform one more iteration using the current float iterate for $g_i$ and adding the AD variable sensitivity to $s$ . This will capture 1st deriavtive sensitivity accurately. To capture 2nd order sensitivity perform one further iteration . Empirically in all my tests this has not failed and is exactly accurate, but I would be more comfortable with a proof. For those interested in some abstract code which I have working according to the above definitions is... def f_and_df(g, s):

The exact equation is part of my PhD research and is needlessly complex for the core of my issue, I will give a simplified example instead: $\int_{R\backslash\{0\}} f(x,y) \nu(dy) = g(x)$ . Assume $f$ and $g$ are sufficiently well-behaved for this integral to work (feel free to choose specific $f$ and $g$ in your answer if you need more details to demonstrate a point) and $R$ represents the set real numbers. My idea is to somehow apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to both sides after differentiating to obtain a differential equation, but for whatever reason I am stuck on dealing with how $\nu$ would interact with the FTC part 1. This would be easy if we had something like $\nu(dx)=h(x)dx$ instead (for some function $h$ ), but I do not see how I could rewrite this equation like that without knowing $\nu$ already.

4906170,Can we determine into how many regions the zero set of a polynomial divides the plane?,"Disclaimer: If you look at my other questions, you will see that I am still learning the basics of algebra. I am well aware that the answer to this question is likely to go beyond my current level of knowledge. This is fine however, as I am mainly asking this question to get some references as to which areas of algebra(ic geometry) I should study to understand questions like this, so that one day I can come back to it and understand fully what is going on. Consider a polynomial $p\in\Bbb R[X,Y]$ . If it has no roots, the roots are isolated points, or we are dealing with the zero polynomial the answer is trivial. We are therefore only interested in the case where $Z(p)$ is a one-dimensional subset of $\Bbb R^2$ . A simple example to consider is then: $$
aX^2 + bY^2 - c = 0
$$ where, even if we did not know that the zero set was an ellipse, we could reasonably guess that the curve is closed since both $X$ and $Y$ are bounded. This immediately implies that the curve divides the plane into two regions, one bounded and one unbounded. Another example is a hyperbola $$
aX^2 - bY^2 - c = 0
$$ where now $X$ and $Y$ are unbounded, the zero set consists of two disjoint one-dimensional sets and therefore it divides the plane into three unbounded areas. A more interesting case is the Tschirnhaus cubic: $$
X^3 - X^2 + Y^2 = 0
$$ which is a connected curve with a singularity, from which we can deduce that it divides the plane into three segments; One bounded and two unbounded. Now these are nontrivial conclusions, and require some work to arrive at and rigorously justify. Now I ask: Is there a single (algorithmic) way to determine into how many segments any given polynomial $$
\sum a_{ij}X^iY^j\quad a_{ij}\in \Bbb R

4906189,"Question about Proof of the Integrability of $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots,$ in Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem","I am self-studying measure theory and got stuck on part of the proof of the Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem: Theorem $\quad$ 2.4.5 $\quad$ (Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem) Let $(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ be a measure space, let $g$ be a $[0,+\infty]$ -valued integrable function on $X$ , and let $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots$ be $[-\infty,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions on $X$ such that \begin{align}
    f(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)\tag1
\end{align} and \begin{align}
    |f_n(x)| \leq g(x),\ n=1,2,\dots\tag2
\end{align} hold at $\mu$ -almost every $x$ in $X$ . Then $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots$ are integrable, and $\int fd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu$ . When proving the theorem, the book claims that ""the integrability of $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots$ follows from that of $g$ ; see Proposition 2.3.8, Proposition 2.3.9, and part (c) of Proposition 2.3.4."" (I added these results at the bottom of this post.) I could not see how the integrability of $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots$ follow immediately from that of $g$ by applying these results. The most important reason is that the relationship (1) and (2) does not hold at every $x$ in $X$ , but instead, hold at $\mu$ -almost every $x$ in $X$ , which makes it illegal to directly apply Proposition 2.3.4 (c). So, I tried to prove it myself. Here are my questions for this post: 1. Is my proof of the integrability of $\mathbf{f}$ and $\mathbf{f_1,f_2,\dots}$ correct? (For example, I have doubts about the relation $\left\{x\in X:\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n(x)| > g(x)\right\} \subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\right\}$ I used in my proof.) 2. Am I overcomplicating anything here? (I am worried about this because the book's claim sounds like the proof shouldn't be that complicated.) 3. From my attempt below and the rest of proof of $\mathbf{\int fd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu}$ presented in the book, it seems that we are not allow to conclude that $\mathbf{\int\lim_{n\to\infty}f_nd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_nd\mu}$ . But why? Here is my attempt to prove the integrability of $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\dots$ : Proof of the integrability of $\mathbf{f}$ and $\mathbf{f_1,f_2,\dots}$ $\quad$ We first prove the integrability of $\mathbf{f_1,f_2,\dots}$ . Let $n$ be a positive integer. The fact that $|f_n(x)|\leq g(x)$ holds almost everywhere implies that there is an $N\in\mathscr{A}$ such that $\mu(N)=0$ and $\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}\subseteq N$ . Since $|f_n|$ and $g$ are $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions, the set $\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\} \in \mathscr{A}$ by Proposition 2.1.3. So, we can let $N = \{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}$ and conclude that $\mu(\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\})=0$ . Since $g$ is integrable and $[0,+\infty]$ -valued, it follows that $\int g^+d\mu = \int gd\mu < +\infty$ . Assume to the contrary that $\int|f_n|d\mu = \sup\left\{\int hd\mu:h \in \mathscr{S}_+\ \text{and}\ h\leq|f_n|\right\} = +\infty$ . Then, as $\int gd\mu<+\infty$ , there exists an $h\in\mathscr{S}_+$ such that $h\leq|f_n|$ and $\int hd\mu > \int gd\mu$ . Denote this $h$ by $h=\sum_{i=1}^ma_i\chi_{A_i}$ , where $a_1,\dots,a_m$ are nonnegative real numbers and $A_1,\dots,A_m$ are disjoint subsets of $X$ that belong to $\mathscr{A}$ . Then \begin{align}
\int|f_n|d\mu \geq \int hd\mu = \sum_{i=1}^ma_i\mu(A_i) > \int gd\mu = \sup\left\{\int pd\mu:p\in\mathscr{S}_+\ \text{and}\ p\leq g\right\}.
\end{align} The set $\{x\in X:h(x)>g(x)\}\neq\emptyset$ , for otherwise $h(x)\leq g(x)$ for all $x$ in $X$ would imply $\int hd\mu \leq \int gd\mu$ (see Proposition 2.3.4 (c)). Without loss of generality, suppose $\{x\in X:h(x) > g(x)\} = \bigcup_{i=1}^kA_i$ and $\{x\in X:h(x) \leq g(x)\} = \bigcup_{i=k+1}^mA_i$ . So for any $x\in A_i$ , $i=k+1,\dots,m$ , we have $a_i\leq g(x)$ . Define a function $p\in\mathscr{S}_+$ be such that $p(x) = a_i$ for all $x\in A_i$ where $i=k+1,\dots,m$ , and $p(x)=0$ for all $x\in A_i$ where $i=1,\dots,k$ . Then $p\leq g$ and $\int pd\mu = \sum_{i=1}^ma_i\mu(A_i)$ . Now, if $\mu(\{x\in X:h(x)>g(x)\}) = \mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^kA_i) = \bigcup_{i=1}^k\mu(A_i) = 0$ , then $\mu(A_i)=0$ for $i=1,\dots,k$ , so that $\int hd\mu = \sum_{i=1}^ma_i\mu(A_i) = \int pd\mu \leq \int gd\mu$ , contradicting the fact that $\int hd\mu > \int gd\mu$ . Thus, $\mu(\{x\in X:h(x)>g(x)\}) > 0$ . But $\{x\in X:h(x)>g(x)\}\subseteq\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}$ . So we get $\mu(\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\})>\mu(\{x\in X:h(x)>g(x)\})>0$ , contradicting the fact that $\mu(\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\})=0$ . Therefore, \begin{align}
\int|f_n|d\mu = \sup\left\{\int hd\mu:h\in\mathscr{S}_+\ \text{and}\ h\leq|f_n|\right\} < +\infty.
\end{align} Hence, $|f_n|$ is integrable. By Proposition 2.3.8, $f_n$ is integrable. Next, we prove the integrability of $\mathbf{f}$ . By Proposition 2.1.5, $\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n|$ and $g$ are $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions, it follows that $\{x\in X:\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}\in\mathscr{A}$ . Since $\{x\in X:\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}\subseteq\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\}$ and $\mu(\{x\in X:|f_n(x)|>g(x)\})=0$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , it follows that $\mu(\{x\in X:\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n(x)|>g(x)\})=0$ . Thus, $\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n|\leq g$ holds $\mu$ -almost everywhere. Then, by a similar argument, we can conclude that \begin{align}
\int\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n|d\mu = \sup\left\{\int d\mu:h\in\mathscr{S}_+\ \text{and}\ h \leq \lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n|\right\}<+\infty.
\end{align} Hence, $\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n| = |\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n|$ is integrable. By Proposition 2.3.8, $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n$ is integrable. Since $f(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$ holds at $\mu$ -almost every $x$ in $X$ , by Proposition 2.3.9, $\int fd\mu$ exists and $\int fd\mu = \int\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)d\mu$ which is finite given the integrability of $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)$ . This implies $f$ is integrable. Thank you very much for any help!

4906277,Under which conditions the Leibniz rule is equivalent to defining the derivative as a limit?,"Let $A$ and $B$ be two $\mathbb{R}$ -vector spaces, and $F$ the $\mathbb{R}$ -vector space of ""smooth enough"" functions between them, where: sum is defined pointwise, and by ""smooth enough"" I mean that all needed limits exist (I don't want to deal with weird cases). With these assumptions, I think you can define the set $D$ of all operators from $F$ to $F$ , of this form: $ d(f)(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} ((f(x+\epsilon v) - f(x)) / \epsilon ) $ .  (clearly there's one for each $v$ ) (Is this ill-defined somehow?) Now, take $B$ to be an algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ , with some vector product. Now $F$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ too, with the product defined pointwise. Clearly the definition of $D$ still applies. But, you can now define a new set of operators, $L$ , defined to be the set of all linear operators from $F$ to $F$ that satisfy the Leibniz rule, $l(fg) = l(f)g + fl(g)$ . My question is: Are $L$ and $D$ the same set? If yes, why? (For context: it looks like they are the same in the case of $A=\mathbb{R}^d$ , $B=\mathbb{R}$ .) If no (as it's more likely in general- since the definition of $D$ doesn't use the product at all!): Can you provide a counterexample? And most importantly: which additional conditions on $B$ do you have to impose for $D$ and $L$ to be the same? For example: Is it only true on $B=\mathbb{R}$ ? What about $B=\mathbb{C}$ ? What if $B$ has finite dimension? And finally (which is of course my real question, although it is only a soft question): why does $L$ turn out to be a more interesting way than $D$ to extend the concept of derivative to more abstract structures? What's interesting about derivatives over algebras? Any insight on this would be appreciated.","['derivatives', 'differential-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

The integral in question is the following: $$I = \iint x^y ~ dx ~ dy$$ So, I begun by calculating the inner integral first getting: $$\int x^y ~ dx = \frac{{x}^{y+1}}{y+1} + c_1$$ Then I have to integrate this with respect to $\displaystyle y$ : $$\int \frac{{x}^{y+1}}{y+1} + c_1 ~ dy = \int \frac{{x}^{y+1}}{y+1} ~ dy + \int c_1 ~ dy = \int \frac{{x}^{y+1}}{y+1} ~ dy + {c}_{1}y$$ I figured I'd solve the first integral with integration by parts using this formula: $$\int u ~ dv = uv - \int v ~ du$$ $$u = {x}^{y+1}$$ $$du = {x}^{y+1} \ln(x) ~ dy$$ $$dv = \frac{1}{y+1} ~ dy$$ $$v = \ln \bigl( |x+1| \bigl)$$ Plugging all this back to the formula I get: $$\int \frac{{x}^{y+1}}{y+1} ~ dy = {x}^{y+1} \ln \bigl( |x+1| \bigl) ~ - \int \ln \bigl( |x+1| \bigl) {x}^{y+1} \ln(x) ~ dy = {x}^{y+1} \ln \bigl( |x+1| \bigl) ~ - {x}^{y+1} \ln \bigl( |x+1| \bigl) ~ + c_2 = c_2$$ Therefore I get the answer to the original integral to be: $$I = \iint x^y ~ dx ~ dy = {c}_{1}y + c_2$$ This did seem odd and I used Wolfram Alpha to check my answer. Acccording to Wolfram the correct answer is: $$I = \iint x^y ~ dx ~ dy = \text{Ei}\bigl( (y+1) \ln(x) \bigl) ~ + {c}_{1}x + c_2$$ Ei is supposed to be the exponensial integral: $$\text{Ei}(x) = - \int_{-x}^{\infty} \frac{{e}^{-t}}{t} ~ dt$$ I did some research on this and I figured out that Wolfram (and some other sites) solve this integral using u-substitution.

4906405,How can I evaluate the Gaussian Integral using power series?,"It's a well known result that the Gaussian integral $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$ evaluates to $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ . This result can be obtained using double integrals with polar coordinates, among other things, but I'm particularly interested in evaluating this integral using power series. The power series of $e^{-x^2}$ is $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{n!}$$ and integrating this, we get $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(n!)

The expression is 0 for the bound of 0, so we're just looking for the limit of this power series as it tends to infinity. Using graphing software, with enough terms from the power series, I can see that the function does indeed spend a while at $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ before diverging. So, how can I analytically prove that the limit of the power series $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(n!) (2n+1)}$$ as $x$ approaches infinity is $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ ?

4906516,"Irrationality of numbers that are the sum of reciprocal factorials, like $e.$","I wish to prove that for any infinite $A\subset \mathbb{N},\ \displaystyle\sum_{k\in A} \frac{1}{k!}$ is irrational, in the same manner that Rudin proves $e$ is irrational. I should mention the trivial case where $\vert\mathbb{N}\setminus A\vert$ is finite, for then $\displaystyle\sum_{k\in A} \frac{1}{k!} = \left(e-\frac{1}{0!}\right) - \sum_{k\in (\mathbb{N}\setminus A)} \frac{1}{k!}, $ which is $e$ subtract a rational number and is therefore irrational. Rudin's proof that $e:= \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}$ is irrational goes as follows. Define $ \displaystyle s_n:= \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!}.\ $ Then, $e - s_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!} < \frac{1}{(n+1)!}\left\{ 1 + \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{\left(n+1\right)^2} + \ldots \right\} = \frac{1}{n!n},\ $ so that $$ 0 < e-s_n < \frac{1}{n!n}. \tag{1}\label{eq1} $$ Now suppose $e$ is rational, that is, $e=p/q,$ where $p,q$ are positive integers. By $\eqref{eq1},$ $$ 0 < q!(e-s_q) < \frac{1}{q}. \tag{2}\label{eq2} $$ By our assumption, $q!e$ is an integer. Since $$ q!s_q = q!\left( 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{1}{q!} \right) $$ is an integer, we see that $q!(e-s_q)$ is an integer. Since $q\geq 1,\ \eqref{eq2}\ $ implies the existence of an integer between $0$ and $1.$ We have thus reached a contradiction. Now onto my attempted proof that for an infinite $A\subset \mathbb{N},\ f:= \displaystyle\sum_{k\in A} \frac{1}{k!}$ is irrational. First, write $A$ as an increasing sequence of integers: $A = \left( a_k \right)_{k=1}^{\infty}.$ Define $ \displaystyle t_n:= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{a_k!}.\ $ Then, $$f - t_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a_k!}< \frac{1}{a_{n+1}!}\left\{ 1 + \frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+1)(a_{n+1}+2)\cdots a_{n+2} } + \frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+1)(a_{n+1}+2)\cdots a_{n+2}(a_{n+2}+1)\cdots a_{n+3} } +  \ldots \right\}.$$ Since $a_n \geq n$ and $a_{n+1}>a_n,$ we can certainly say that $0 < f - t_n < \frac{1}{n!n}$ by comparison with the reasons given for $\eqref{eq1},$ although this inequality is weak and could be improved. But then if we continue the proof similar to irrationality of $e,$ that is, suppose $f=p/q,\ p,q$ are integers. Then $0 < q!(f-t_q) < \frac{1}{q}$ is true, but there are problems in the next statement: we cannot say $q!t_q = q!\left( \frac{1}{a_1!} + \frac{1}{a_2!} + \ldots + \frac{1}{a_q!} \right) $ is an integer. Alternatively, $a_q!t_q$ is an integer, although I don't see how to use this to make an equation like equation $\eqref{eq1}.$ Have I made a mistake somewhere? If not, is there a way to make some progress here and prove my desired statement? I do feel like I'm missing something relatively obvious.","['irrational-numbers', 'proof-writing', 'factorial', 'sequences-and-series']"
4906551,Each symmetry of a triangle corresponds to exactly one permutation,"I am trying to understand a statement about symmetries of a triangle. The set of lecture notes I am working through assert that (1) every permutation corresponds to a symmetry and (2) every symmetry corresponds to exactly one permutation. As there are only six symmetries, I can write out each of them and directly verify this, but I would like to understand it at more of an abstract level. Once I generalize to an $n$ -gon, I know that it is no longer the case that every permutation corresponds to a symmetry. (For example, there are $4! = 24$ permutations of four vertices but only $8$ symmetries of a square.) For the second assertion, I believe the explanation in Dummit and Foote works, provided that I fully understand it. Say we label the vertices of an $n$ -gon modulo $n$ , so vertex $1$ is adjacent to vertices $2$ and $n-1$ , moving clockwise. Because a symmetry is a rigid motion, it needs to map adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices, so if it sends vertex $1$ to vertex $i$ , it needs to send vertex $2$ to either vertex $i+1$ or $i - 1$ . Once this vertex is chosen, the new position of vertex $n-1$ is determined and the symmetry itself is fully determined. I think this should imply that if $x$ and $y$ are distinct symmetries, then they correspond to distinct permutations of the vertices. But I think my logic is a bit circular here, as I'm inclined to define ""distinct symmetries"" as there existing a vertex sent to distinct places by the two symmetries.","['group-theory', 'symmetry']"

Assume that the coefficients are uniformly random in $(-1,1)$ . It is well known that most of absolute values of the roots have value close to one i.e. the roots tend to form a unit circle around the origin as shown in the figure below for a polynomial of degree $n = 666$ .

4906885,Why is $x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3$ constant for an equilateral triangle?,"Consider an equilateral triangle centered at the origin of the 2D Cartesian space. Let the coordinates of its vertices be $v_1=(x_1,y_1)$ , $v_2=(x_2,y_2)$ and $v_3=(x_3,y_3)$ . All such triangles can be defined by the following conditions: \begin{gather}
||v_1 - v_2|| = ||v_1 - v_3|| = ||v_2 - v_3|| & \label{eq_dist}\tag{1} \\
v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = (0, 0) & \label{sum_0}\tag{2} \\
\end{gather} Using these conditions it can be shown that $||v_1|| = ||v_2|| = ||v_3||$ (see proof here ). Let $$r = ||v_1|| = ||v_2|| = ||v_3|| \label{eq_len}\tag{3}$$ My question is whether there is a simple algebraic explanation for the fact that the expression $$d_x \overset{\text{def}}{=} x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3$$ does not depend on the angle of rotation of the triangle about the origin. I made an interactive Desmos link where you can observe this behavior. Note that, in that link, I used $s$ as the radius instead of $r$ , since $r$ is a special variable in Desmos. I will proceed by listing and then detailing some of my findings: $v_1 \cdot v_2 + v_1 \cdot v_3 + v_2 \cdot v_3$ is also rotation-independent I found a trigonometric proof for my question This behavior also happens with a tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (see this Desmos link ) 1) $v_1 \cdot v_2 + v_1 \cdot v_3 + v_2 \cdot v_3$ is also rotation-independent This expression, although different than $d_x$ , is closely related to it, since each individual dot product can be expressed as: $$v_k \cdot v_j = x_k x_j + y_k y_j$$ Which implies that $$\color{blue}{v_1 \cdot v_2} + \color{red}{v_1 \cdot v_3} + \color{green}{v_2 \cdot v_3} = (\color{blue}{x_1 x_2} + \color{red}{x_1 x_3} + \color{green}{x_2 x_3}) + (\color{blue}{y_1 y_2} + \color{red}{y_1 y_3} + \color{green}{y_2 y_3})$$ It is therefore handy to define \begin{align*}
d_y & \overset{\text{def}}{=} y_1 y_2 + y_1 y_3 + y_2 y_3 \\
d & \overset{\text{def}}{=} v_1 \cdot v_2 + v_1 \cdot v_3 + v_2 \cdot v_3
\end{align*} Which allows us to write $$d = d_x + d_y$$ This means that if $d$ and $d_y$ are rotation-independent, so is $d_x$ . We can show that $d$ is rotation-independent by noticing that each of the three dot products is also rotation-independent. This happens because the dot product depends only on each vector's norm, and the angle between them - and none of those change when rotating the whole triangle about the origin. Nevertheless, I present a simple algebraic proof for this fact: \begin{align*}
||v_1||^2 & = r^2 & \text{by (\ref{eq_len})} \\
||- v_2 - v_3||^2 & = r^2 & \text{by (\ref{sum_0})} \\
(- x_2 - x_3)^2 + (- y_2 - y_3)^2 & = r^2 & \text{expand} \\
\color{blue}{x_2^2} + 2 x_2 x_3 + \color{red}{x_3^2} + \color{blue}{y_2^2} + 2 y_2 y_3 + \color{red}{y_3^2} & = r^2 & \text{expand} \\
\color{blue}{r^2} + \color{red}{r^2} + 2 x_2 x_3 + 2 y_2 y_3 & = r^2 & \text{by (\ref{eq_len})} \\
x_2 x_3 + y_2 y_3 & = - \frac{r^2}{2} & \text{simplify} \\
v_2 \cdot v_3 & = - \frac{r^2}{2} & \text{by definition of $\cdot$} \\
\end{align*} By symmetry, this proof also applies to $v_1 \cdot v_2$ and $v_1 \cdot v_3$ , and thus \begin{gather}
v_1 \cdot v_2 = v_1 \cdot v_3 = v_2 \cdot v_3 = - \frac{r^2}{2} \\
d = v_1 \cdot v_2 + v_1 \cdot v_3 + v_2 \cdot v_3 = - \frac{3}{2} r^2
\end{gather} Although this is an interesting result, it is not enough, since we would also need to show that $d_y$ is rotation-independent. It could be the case that $d_x$ and $d_y$ both depended on the triangle's rotation but their sum did not - just like the cosine and sine functions depend on their argument but the sum of their squares does not. But if $d_x$ and $d_y$ were indeed rotation-independent (which I know is true, but am trying to find a simple algebraic proof for), since conditions (\ref{eq_dist}) and (\ref{sum_0}) are symmetrical in $x$ and $y$ , we would have $$d_x = d_y = \frac{d}{2} = - \frac{3}{4} r^2 \label{dx_dy}\tag{4}$$ However, I was unable to prove this fact algebraically. 2) I found a trigonometric proof for my question This proof is based in two observations: $v_1$ , $v_2$ and $v_3$ lie in a circle centered at $(0, 0)$ (by \ref{sum_0}) and with radius $r$ (by \ref{eq_len}) The angle between each pair of vertices (seen as vectors) is $\frac{1}{3}$ of a full turn, since the triangle is equilateral (by \ref{eq_dist}) These allow us to write \begin{align*}
v_1 = (x_1, y_1) & = (r \cos{\theta}, r \sin{\theta}) & \label{trig1}\tag{5.1} \\
v_2 = (x_2, y_2) & = (r \cos{(\theta + \frac{2 \pi}{3})}, r \sin{(\theta + \frac{2 \pi} {3})}) & \label{trig2}\tag{5.2} \\
v_3 = (x_3, y_3) & = (r \cos{(\theta - \frac{2 \pi}{3})}, r \sin{(\theta - \frac{2 \pi}{3})}) & \label{trig3}\tag{5.3}
\end{align*} where $\theta$ is an arbitrary real number. To simplify a computation below, we will now compute \begin{align}
\cos(\alpha + \beta) \cos(\alpha - \beta) & = (\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta) (\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta) \\
& = \cos^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta & \label{cos_prod}\tag{6}
\end{align} So, we have \begin{align*}
d_x & = x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 & \text{by definition} \\
& = x_1(x_2 + x_3) + x_2 x_3 \\
& = x_1(- x_1) + x_2 x_3 & \text{by (\ref{sum_0})} \\
& = x_2 x_3 - x_1^2 \\
& = r^2 (\cos(\theta + \frac{2 \pi}{3}) \cos(\theta - \frac{2 \pi}{3}) - \cos^2 \theta) & \text{by (\ref{trig1}), (\ref{trig2}) and (\ref{trig3})} \\
& = r^2 (\cos^2 \theta \cos^2 \frac{2 \pi}{3} - \sin^2 \theta \sin^2 \frac{2 \pi}{3} - \cos^2 \theta) & \text{by (\ref{cos_prod})} \\
& = r^2 ((\cos^2 \theta) (- \frac{1}{2})^2 - (\sin^2 \theta) (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - \cos^2 \theta) \\
& = r^2 (\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 \theta - \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 \theta - \cos^2 \theta) \\
& = r^2 (- \frac{3}{4} (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta)) \\
& = - \frac{3}{4} r^2
\end{align*} This allows us to conclude that the equality (\ref{dx_dy}) is indeed true. However, we had to resort to trigonometry, whilst I was looking for an algebraic proof. Moreover, this trigonometric proof does not give me a good understanding of how conditions (\ref{eq_dist}) and (\ref{sum_0}) imply that $d_x$ only depends on $r$ and not on $\theta$ . It seems that it could have been just a matter of luck that $x_1^2 = r^2 \cos^2 \theta$ and $x_2 x_3 = r^2 (\cos^2 \theta - \frac{3}{4})$ . But looking at higher dimensions, the pattern seems to repeat, hinting that there must be something more intricate going on here. 3) This behavior also happens with a tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$ By considering a tetrahedron centered at the origin of the 3D Cartesian space, defining conditions analagous to (\ref{eq_dist}) and (\ref{sum_0}), and performing a trigonometric change of variables akin to (\ref{trig1}), (\ref{trig2}) and (\ref{trig3}), I was able to show that an expression analogous to $d_x$ (i.e., $\sum_{k < j}{x_k x_j}$ ) does not depend on the rotation of the tetrahedron about the origin. You can observe this behavior by playing around with this Desmos link . That is it. Any insights on this problem would be appreciated, even if they don't directly answer my question.

For example, let $P(x)$ be the property that $\det(x) = 0$ . Then $P(x)$ would be undefined if $x$ is a real number since the determinant of a real number is undefined. Hence, a statement like $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, P(x)$ does not have a truth value. Is this correct?

4907036,What is the minimal number of pieces to surround n pieces in a Go game?,"Go is a game of black and white pieces on a lattice of $19\times 19$ . Pieces have liberty by having empty spaces next to them and are killed if the liberty are occupied by the opponent. Pieces are connected if they are next to each other (vertical/horizontal connection only, not diagonal connection) and share their liberty. For the problem, we assume it's played on an infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ . The problem is, for $n$ pieces, what is the least liberty they can have? for example, for two pieces, we can make it like XX and there will be $6$ liberty, make it XOX then $7$ , and XOOX then $8$ . Then the answer is $6$ . Here is the construction for small numbers . we have a conjecture on OEIS saying that the answer is $2+\lceil\sqrt{8n-4}\rceil$ . But It doesn't have the proof, or at least I didn't see it. I have some trivial thinking about the problem: This minimum value must exist and can be reached. Since they are all integers, this is obvious. The pieces must be connected. For situations where they are not connected, connecting them can reduce the amount of liberty. (Edit: for $n=2$ , this is incorrect, because the direct or diagonal connection both give $6$ , meaning the proof is invalid. Probably the statement is ""it has to be connected or 'connected' diagonally, and we can always find a connected construction if a non-connected solution exists."" And for greater $n$ , this statement should be right. But I can't yet prove it.) For a shape of $n$ pieces, you can always take away a piece from the edge and achieve the same number of liberty or less. This is not obvious enough because you have to choose ""convex"" edges, otherwise he will actually have more liberty. We need to prove that there is always a point that can be taken away so that the number of liberty does not increase. Our idea of â€‹â€‹proof is: if all the pieces are ""concave"", the number of pieces will explode to infinity. First, when taking away a piece, we check whether there are pieces in all four directions. For example, the piece's coordinates are $(a, b)$ , then we check $x<a, x>a, y<a, y>a$ whether there are pieces in the four regions. Once there are no pieces in one of the regions, then this is the piece we want to take away, since at this time, there are only three positions around the piece that can affect the changes of liberty upon removal. Just enumerate all possibilities. And if there are always pieces in the four directions, we will find that the distribution of pieces is unbounded, which contradicts with the finite number of chess pieces. This sequence is constant or increasing. This is a corollary of 3. The chess shape that reaches the minimum value should have no eyes (meaning holes inside the shape), and even if it does have eyes, there will be a solution without eyes. For the case where there are eyes, just remove a piece from the edge and fill in the eyes (this is also a corollary of 3). Can anyone figure out or find the full proof?","['graph-theory', 'extremal-combinatorics', 'combinatorics', 'chessboard', 'game-theory']"

Question: Show that there are $\mathfrak{c}$ many $f\in \hspace{1mm}^\omega\omega$ s.t. $\bigcap_{i\in\omega} A^i_{f(i)}\neq \emptyset $ . I think my approaches were flawed in many ways. I still wanted to post the most promising one: I wanted to start building a binary tree where the vertices correspond to sets in the rows of the matrix such that, moving down any branch, the intersection of the sets is not empty. Then I can encode $\mathfrak{c}$ many functions using binary respresentaion ( $b(x)(i)$ ) such that a $0$ corresponds to taking the left path ( $k^i_l$ ) and a $1$ to taking the right path ( $k^i_d$ ): $$f_x(i):=\begin{cases}k^i_d, & b(x)(i)=1 \\ k^i_l, & b(x)(i)=0  \end{cases}$$ As for the tree: Step 1: I start with an uncountable $A^0_k$ . This must exist since I can't cover $[0,1]$ with countably many countable sets. I divide $A^0_k$ into two sets of size $|A^0_k|$ : $V^0_1$ and $V^0_2$ . Step n+1: I find a set $A^{n+1}_{k_1}$ that has uncountable intersection with $V^n_1$ . This must exist by the same argument as above. I split it into two sets of size $|A^{n+1}_{k_1}|$ : $V^{n+1}_1$ and $V^{n+1}_2$ . For the other $V^n_i$ respectively. There are a few problems with this: The sets in a row are only disjoint ""up to being identical"" and I need $\omega$ many different branches at each vertex since otherwise I can't encode all real numbers [SOLVED] Doesn't this imply the set $\bigcap_{i\in\omega}A^i_{k_i}$ (or the intersection over any branch) is uncountable.  But the thrid condition would imply that such intersections have to be countable. [SOLVED] (new) The intersection might be empty along too many branches.

The top square is commutative by the previous observation from definition 1. The left square is commutative by the previous observation from definition 2.

First, to clarify, let $\{a_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ . We define $M_n := \sup\{a_k : k \geq n\}$ and $m_n := \inf\{a_k: k \geq n\}$ yielding two new sequences $\{M_n\}$ and $\{m_n\}$ which may contain the symbols $\infty$ or $-\infty$ .

For any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $|a_n - b| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \geq N$ . Those, we have $b - \varepsilon < a_n < b + \varepsilon$ . But then, $\mathbf{b - \varepsilon < M_n \leq b + \varepsilon}$ and $\mathbf{b - \varepsilon \leq m_n < b + \varepsilon}$ for all $\mathbf{n \geq N}$ . Since this holds for every $\varepsilon > 0$ , we have $\limsup_{n \to \infty} a_n =  \liminf_{n \to \infty} a_n = b$ . I am not sure how the bold statement follows immediately. Clearly, $b - \varepsilon < M_n$ and $m_n < b + \varepsilon$ , but I don't see why $M_n \leq b + \varepsilon$ and $b - \varepsilon \leq m_n$ . I am sure it's something simple that I'm not seeing (properties of supremum and infimum probably), but any help would be appreciated.","['limsup-and-liminf', 'real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'supremum-and-infimum']"

I fully understand the simpler problem, that is, out of 10 people, probability that at least 2 share the same birthday.
An easier way to solve this problem than solving for the probability that any 2 or more of the 10 people share a birthday is to solve for the probability that all of the people have unique birthdays (non-shared) and subtracting that from 100%. The first person has 365 possible days that could be their birthday. Then, the second person has 364 days that could be their birthday without sharing with someone else, because person 1â€™s birthday is one of those days. This process goes on for all of the 10 people, until the 10th person has 356 possible days that could be their birthday.
The easiest way to express the total possible combinations of days in which none of the 10 people share a birthday is $365 \times 364 \times 363 \times â€¦ 356$ , that is, $\frac{365!}{355!}$ . To solve for the total probability that, out of the original $365^{10}$ days, there are $\frac{365!}{355!}$ where no one shares a birthday, we have: $\frac{(\frac{365!}{355!})}{365^{10}}$ Then we subtract this from $100%$ to get the complementary probability. But this will give us the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday.
To find the same but for exactly 2 people, how do we approach it?
My approach is as follows:
First, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes, which is the total number of ways to assign birthdays to 10 people without restrictions. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, each person can have a birthday on any of these days. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is $365^{10}$ .
Then we calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 to share the same birthday, multiplied by the number of ways to choose a specific birthday for them:
The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 10 is: ${10 \choose 2}=\frac{10!}{(10âˆ’2)!2!}$ .
For each pair of people, there are 365 possible birthdays they could share. So, the number of favorable outcomes is $45 \times 365$ .
Then, we calculate the probability: $\frac{(45\times 365)}{365^{10}}$ .

4907555,Why is construction required in geometry?,"I don't know if this is a good question to ask but I need some advice, anything is appreciated. (Contruction here, doesn't imply geometric construction tools one) Q1 :In solving problems in geometry, we often have to make a construction.
Making a construction, does not create anything new. Then why can not we solve problems without any construction? Why do we need to make constructions, if they don't add any new condition to the problem? Q2 : How do you motivate towards a construction? I have a hard time at hitting at the right construction, so is there any way to know what to do, in order to arrive at the proof or is it again just experience?

This equation comes from the heat equation in polar coordinates for function $\psi(r, \theta) = \phi(r)e^{i\theta}$ . Plugging this form of $\phi$ in the equation leads to the ODE in $\xi$ $$\frac{1}{t^{\gamma + 1}} \left( g'' + \frac{1}{\xi} g' - \frac{1}{\xi^2} g + \gamma g + \frac{1}{2}\xi g\right) = 0 \quad \text{for } \xi = \frac{r}{\sqrt t}.$$ Multiplying by $t^{\gamma + 1}$ on both sides, we get the ODE depending only on $\xi$ and $\gamma$ . I would like to find solution of this equation for specific value of $\gamma$ . I managed to find a straightforward solution $g(\xi) = \xi$ for $\gamma = -1/2$ . Moreover, for $\gamma = 3/2$ , I managed to find the solution $$g(\xi) = \xi e^{-\xi^2/4}.$$ Now I would like to find solution of this ODE for $\gamma$ positive and lower than $3/2$ , i.e. $\gamma \in (0,3/2)$ , but to be honest I don't see anything obvious.

4907620,Expectation of the power of random graph's adjacency matrix,"I am trying to find the power of the random graph's adjacency matrix. Consider the $2N$ number of nodes, where $N \geq 2$ is a fixed natural number. WLOG, let nodes with index $1$ to $N$ belong to Group 1, and nodes with index $N + 1$ to $2N$ belong to Group 2. Then, for a node pair within the same group, a pair of nodes form an edge with the probability of $p$ (i.e., $P(\{v_{i},v_{j}\} \in \mathcal{E}) = p$ if $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ belong to the same group.) Else, for a node pair in the different groups, a pair of nodes form an edge with the probability of $1-p$ (i.e., $P(\{v_{i},v_{j}\} \in \mathcal{E}) = 1-p$ if $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ belong to the different groups.) We do not allow the self-loop. You may think this is a variant of the Erods-Renyi random graph, where there are two disjoint node groups. Note that this is an undirected graph. Let $A$ be an adjacency matrix of this random graph. My question is: What is the closed-form solution to the expectation of 4-power and 3-power of $A$ ? That is: $\mathbb{E}_{A}[A^{3}]$ and $\mathbb{E}_{A}[A^{4}]$ . In other words, what would be the expected number of length-3 and length-4 paths between node $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ (this would differ whether $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ belong to the same group or not)?

4907626,Does anybody know this integral expression?,"I stumbled upon the following integral, which is a low dimensional case of a minimization problem I currently investigate. $$F(V) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}|W+\nabla\times V)|^2+|\nabla\times(W+\nabla\times V))|^2dx$$ where $W$ is a fixed vector field that is divergence free and $V$ is another vector field, both compactly supported on $\mathbb{R}^3$ or periodic in all components in which case we would just integrate over the smallest period rectangle (I do not know if there is a term describing what I mean here, but it should be clear). Of course by Poincares lemma one has that in the non-periodic case a minimizer $V$ is the negative vector potential of $W$ , since then $F(V)=0$ .

4907634,Clarifications on the solution of a double integral: $\iint_X\frac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2}dxdy$,"Calculate the following double integral: $$\iint_X\frac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2}dxdy$$ where $X=\{(x,y)\in \Bbb R^2\colon 1\leq x^2+y^2\leq2x\}.$ Here my confusion arises. Looking at the integrand the polar coordinates seem to be better suited to solve the exercise. But I have the problem with the domain. If I used polar coordinates I would write: $$1\leq r^2\leq 2r\cos\vartheta $$ I have drew the domain with an online tool https://www.wolframalpha.com/ and the domain is a half-moon of which I understand from the drawing the limits of $x$ but not those of $y$ (How to find the limits of $x$ and $y$ ?). They are two circumferences of center in $O$ and radius $1$ and the other a circle of center in $(1,0)$ and radius $1$ .
I think by eyes that even setting the correct integration extremes, for sure the double integral is very complicated.
Staying in polar coordinates if I looked at the drawing I would immediately realize that $1\leq r\leq 2$ which I cannot find from $1\leq r^2\leq 2r\cos\vartheta$ and that $\vartheta\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$ . We would have $$\iint_X\frac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2}dxdy=\int_{[1,2]}rdr\int_{[-\pi/2,\pi/2]}\frac{r^3\cos^2\vartheta\sin\vartheta}{r^2}d\vartheta$$ $$=\int_{[1,2]}r^2dr\int_{[-\pi/2,\pi/2]}\cos^2\vartheta\sin\vartheta d\vartheta$$ But the second integral is zero (it is an immediate integral). So the double integral is worth $0$ ? I don't think so.

So: $BD = p-b = \frac{a+c-b}2$ $\frac{x}{x+a} = \frac{c}b \iff GB = \frac{ac}{b-c}$ so $MB = \frac12(\frac{ac}{b-c} + b-p)$ what now? EDIT2: Ok, now we got the final hint in the comments. It is clear that $\mathcal H (G,D;B,C)$ which implies that $$MD^2 = MB \cdot MC$$ Look how interesting: if the mark the intersections of the green polar with the incircle and name them $XY$ , then quad $XYBD$ is cyclic as $MX \cdot MY = MD^2 = MB \cdot MC$ .
