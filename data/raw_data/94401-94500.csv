1292143,$f_n\to f$ iff for each closed rectifiable curve $f_n (z) \to f (z)$ uniformly for $z$ in the trace of the curve,"I'd like to know if the following exercise is correct. I'm not completely sure about the last point but also I don't know what more I'd say. I really appreciate corrections or any suggestion you can provide. Let $f, f_1 , f_2 ,\ldots$ be elements of $H(G)$ and show that $f_n\to f$ iff for each closed rectifiable curve $\gamma$ in $G$, $f_n (z) \to f (z)$ uniformly for $z$ in $\{\gamma\}$. Since $\{\gamma\}$ is compact the sufficiently is clear. Conversely, let $a\in G$ and $r>0$ such that $\overline B(a,r)\subset G$, then there is a number $R>r$ such that $\overline B(a,R)\subset G$. Define $\gamma (t)= a + R\exp (2\pi it)$ (for $0\le t \le 1$) and $\vert z-a \lvert \le r $, $$\lvert f(z) -f_n(z)\rvert=\frac{1}{2\pi }\bigg \rvert\int_{\gamma}\frac{f(\zeta)-f_n(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta\bigg \lvert\le 2\sup\{ \rvert f(\zeta)-f_n(\zeta)\lvert: \zeta \in \{\gamma\} \} $$ Given $\epsilon>0$, $\sup\{ \rvert f(\zeta)- f_n(\zeta)\lvert: \zeta \in \{\gamma\} \}< \epsilon/3$ whenever $n\ge N$ and so $$\lvert f(z) -f_n(z)\lvert<2\epsilon/3$$ Then, $\sup \{ \lvert f(z)-f_n(z) \lvert: z\in \overline B(a,r),n\ge N\}<\epsilon$. It follows that $f_n$ converges uniformly on $\overline B(a,r)$. Now if $K\subset G$ is an arbitrary compact and $0<r<\operatorname{dist}(\operatorname{fr}(G),K)$, then we can cover by $r$-disk the compact $K$ $$K\subset \bigcup \{B(z_n:r):1\le n\le N \text{ and } z_n\in K\}$$ Since the convergence is uniformly on each disk $B(z_n,r)$, hence the convergence must be uniformly on $K$ as desired.",['complex-analysis']

1292329,Uniform integrability and weak L1 convergence,"I am working on exercise 4.14 in chapter 3 (on convergence) in the book ""Probability and Stochastics"" by Erhan Cinlar. The exercise can be found on page 109. First, let me give the necessary definitions to make sure the exercise is understood correctly: A sequence $(X_n)$ in $L^1$ is said to converge weakly in $L^1$ if the following holds (p. 108): \begin{equation}\lim \mathbb{E} X_n Y = \mathbb{E} X Y,\end{equation} for every bounded random variable $Y$. A sequence $(X_n)$ is uniformly integrable (p. 72) if:\begin{equation}\limsup \mathbb{E}[|X_n|1_{\{|X_n|>b\}}] =0.\end{equation} Selection principle (p. 95): If every subsequence that has a limit has the same value for the limit, then the sequence tends to the saem value. If the sequence is bounded, and every convergent subsequence of it has the same limit, then the sequence converges to the same value. Finally, here is the exercise:
A sequence is uniformly integrable if and only if its every subsequence has a further subsequence that converges weakly in $L^1$. Here is my current approach (which I think is wrong): $\Rightarrow:$ Uniform integrability is equal to convergence in $L^1$, so if there is a bounded random variable Y (i.e. $|Y| < b$), then \begin{equation}|\mathbb{E}X_n Y - \mathbb{E}XY| \leq \mathbb{E}|X_n Y - XY| \leq b \mathbb{E}|X_n - X| \rightarrow 0.\end{equation} $\Leftarrow:$ We know there exists a bounded random variable Y such that $\lim \mathbb{E}X_n Y = \mathbb{E} XY,$so we can use the selection principle to show that $\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_{n_j}Y] = E[XY].$ Applying the selection principle again, we can show that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\mathbb{E}[X_nY] =\mathbb{E}[XY].$ Therefire $X_nY$ converges to XY in $L^1$, and therefore it is uniformly integrable.","['probability-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'convergence-divergence', 'lp-spaces']"
1292330,Pointwise Convergence: No Diagonal Subsequence Exists?,"Can anyone find a sequence of arbitrary functions $f_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that converge pointwise to an arbitrary function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, such that for each $n$, there is a sequence of arbitrary functions $f^{k}_{n}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that converges pointwise to $f_n$ as $k$ goes to $\infty$, but such that no subsequence of the $f^{k}_{n}$'s converges to $f$? Alternatively, can it be shown that such an example is impossible? (These functions cannot be measurable, otherwise there is a simple argument that shows that this cannot work.) The question arises as follows: suppose $A$ is set of functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $B$ is a subset of $A$ such that every function in $A$ is the pointwise limit of functions from $B$, and $C$ is a subset of $B$ such that every function in $B$ is the pointwise limit of functions from $C$. Is every function in $A$ a pointwise limit of functions from $C$? The obvious approach is to use a `diagonal subsequence' argument. Note that this is not the same as showing that a dense subset of a dense subset is dense in the whole space in the topological sense, since the topology of pointwise convergence is not first-countable, and so the sequential closure differs from the `setwise' closure.","['examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'measure-theory']"

1, \mbox{if}~ \omega = t}.$ Then $X_t^{-1}(\{0\}) = \emptyset$ $X_t^{-1}(\{1\}) = \{t\}$ and since $\emptyset,\{t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \geq 0$, $X_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable and therefore adapted.

1292891,The locus of points from which tangents to a parabola make a constant angle is a hyperbola with the same focus as the parabola,"It is well known that when two tangents to a parabola are perpendicular to each other, they intersect on the directrix. In other words, the intersection point of the two tangents make a straight line, in this case, the directrix, However, when the two tangents to a parabola intersect at another angle, it seems that the intersection point of the two tangents always forms a hyperbola, regardless of the angle. (The original problem I encountered asked the trace of the intersection point when the angle was 45degrees) And surprisingly, the hyperbola has the same focus with the parabola. This can be proven by brute-force algebra, with the same method used to prove the directrix property. The question I'd like to ask is : Is there a geometric, or maybe an intuitive proof to why the trace of the intersection point forms a hyperbola, and why the focus of the hyperobla and parabola are the same?

Show that $N=A \cup \text{ boundary }A$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary. (It is well to bear in mind the following example: if $A=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: |x|<1 \text{ or } 1<|x|<2 \}$ then $N=A \cup \text{ boundary }A$ is a manifold-with-boundary, but $\partial N \neq \text{boundary }A$.) (b) Prove a similar assertion for an open subset of an $n$-dimensional manifold. My attempt: If $x \in \text{int } N$ then $x$ satisfies the manifold condition ""(M)"" from the textbook: Setting $U=V:=\text{int }N$ and $h=\text{Id}_U$ we have that $h$ is a diffeomorphism $U \to V$ with $h(U \cap N)=V \cap \mathbb{R}^n$. If $x \in N \setminus \text{ int }N$ I want to prove that $x$ satisfies the condition $(M')$: there exist open sets $U' \ni x,V'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a diffeomorphism $g:U' \to V'$ such that $g(U' \cap N)=V' \cap \mathbb{H}^n$, where $\mathbb{H}^n$ is the half space where the last coordinate is non-negative. The condition ""(M')"" also requires that $g(x)$ has its last coordinate$=0$. Now, since boundary $A$ is an $(n-1)$ dimensional manifold we have the existence of open sets $U'' \ni x,V'' \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and a diffeomorphim $f:U'' \to V''$ such that $f(U'' \cap \text{ boundary }A)=V'' \cap (\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \times \{0\})$. I now want to say that we can pretty much use the same $f$ as $g$. As $f(U'' \cap A)$ must not intersect the hyper-plane $\{x_n=0\}$. If $U'' \cap A$ is connected I can compose with a negation if necessary to make the image be in the half-space $\mathbb{H}^n$. However, if there are several connected components I couldn't do anything. Can anyone please help me finish this proof? Thank you!","['analysis', 'manifolds']"

First of all, I know that for two irreducible quasi-projective varieities $X$ and $Y$, $X$ is birational to $Y$ if and only if the function fields $k(X) \simeq k(Y)$. Now, if we consider $\mathbb{P}^2_k \cap U_z \simeq \mathbb{A}^2_k$, then the function field of $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ is that of $\mathbb{A}^2_k$, so is $k(x,y)$. On the other hand, as a variety, $\mathbb{P}_k^1 \times \mathbb{P}_k^1 \simeq \mathbb{V}(xw-yz) \subset \mathbb{P}_k^3$ (using the Segre morphism). Then taking $\mathbb{V}(xw-yz) \cap $ $ U_w \simeq \mathbb{V}(x-yz) \subset \mathbb{A}^3_k$, we have that $\mathbb{V}(xw-yz) \cap U_w $ $= k[x,y,z]/(x-yz) $  $ \simeq k[y,z]$. So then $k(\mathbb{P}_k^1 \times \mathbb{P}_k^1) = k(y,z) \simeq k(\mathbb{P}_k^2)$. So then $\mathbb{P}_k^2$ is birational to $\mathbb{P}_k^1 \times \mathbb{P}_k^1$.

1293310,"Prob. 1, Sec. 27, in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed: How to show that the compactness of every closed interval implies the least upper bound property?","Here is Prob. 1, Sec. 27, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Prove that if $X$ is an ordered set in which every closed interval is compact, then $X$ has the least upper bound property. My Attempt: Let $A$ be any non-empty subset of $X$ such that $A$ is bounded above in $X$ ; let $U$ be the set of all the upper bounds in $X$ of this set $A$ . Then $U$ is also a non-empty subset of $X$ . Case 1. If $A \cap U \not= \emptyset$ , let us suppose that $v \in A \cap U$ . Now as $v \in U$ , so $v$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ , by our definition of the set $U$ . Also, as every element of $U$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ and as $v \in A$ , so we must have $$ v \leq u \ \mbox{ for every element }  u \in U. $$ Thus $v$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ and $v \leq u$ for every upper bound $u$ of $A$ . Therefore $v$ is the least upper bound of the set $A$ . Case 2. Let us now suppose that $A \cap U = \emptyset$ . Then for every element $a \in A$ and for every element $u \in U$ , we must have $a < u$ . Let $a \in A$ and $u \in U$ be arbitrary. Then $a < u$ . Moreover, the closed interval $[a,u]$ is compact, by our hypothesis. Let $\mathscr{L}$ be the collection of all the closed intervals of the form $[x, y]$ , where $x \in A$ , $y \in U$ , and $[x,y] \subset [a,u]$ . That is, let $$ \mathscr{L} \colon= \big\{ \ [x, y] \ \colon \ x \in A, y \in U, a \leq x < y \leq u \ \big\}. \tag{*} $$ Then the interval $[a, u]$ itself is in $\mathscr{L}$ so that $\mathscr{L}$ is non-empty. If $\left[x_1, y_1 \right], \ldots, \left[x_n, y_n \right]$ be any finite subcollection of $\mathscr{L}$ , then we have $$ \bigcap_{j=1}^n \left[ x_j, y_j \right] = \left[ x_0, y_0 \right], $$ where $$ x_0 \colon= \max \left\{ x_1, \ldots, x_n \right\}, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad y_0 \colon= \min \left\{ y_1, \ldots, y_n \right\}. $$ Thus $\bigcap_{j=1}^n \left[ x_j, y_j \right]$ is again an interval in $\mathscr{L}$ and is therefore non-empty. Then $\mathscr{L}$ is a collection of non-empty closed sets in $[a,u]$ such that $\mathscr{L}$ has the finite intersection property. Since $[a,u]$ is compact, therefore the intersection of all the closed intervals in $\mathscr{L}$ is non-empty, by Theorem 26.9 in Munkres. That is, there is an element $p \in [a,u]$ such that $p \in [x,y]$ for all $x \in A$ and for all $y \in U$ for which $[x,y] \subset [a,u]$ . In particular, this $p \in [a, u]$ also, so that $$ a \leq p \leq u. \tag{1} $$ But $a$ was chosen to be an arbitrary element of set $A$ , and $u$ was chosen to be an arbitrary element of the set $U$ (i.e. $u$ was chosen to be an arbitrary upper bound for the set $A$ ). Thus the leftmost inequality in (1) implies that $p$ is an upper bound of the set $A$ , and the rightmost inequality in (1) implies that $p$ is also the least of all of the upper bounds of $A$ . Hence $p$ is the least upper bound of the set $A$ . But as $A$ was chosen to be an arbitrary non-empty subset of $X$ which was bounded above in $X$ , so we can conclude that $X$ has the least upper bound property. Is this proof correct? If so, is it clear enough? If not, then where are the issues?","['order-theory', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"

Thus, there is an $n$-ball of radius $\delta$ for some $\delta>0$ centered at $a$ that lies entirely within $f^{-1}(B)$. Call this $n$-ball $B^{-1}$. Note, $f(B^{-1})=B$ is not necessarily true, as $f$ isn't necessarily surjective. But we know that, by the definition of $B$, for every point $x$ within $f^{-1}(B)$, we have that $\left|f(x)-f(a)\right|<\epsilon$. We also know that $B^{-1}\subset f^{-1}(B)$.

Let $$A(t) = \left( \int_0^t \sin(x^2)\,dx \right)^2$$ $$A'(t) = 2\sin(t^2) \int_0^t \sin(x^2)\,dx$$ Let $x=yt$ $A'(t) = 2\sin(t^2) \int_0^1 \sin(t^2y^2)t\,dy $ $A'(t) = \int_0^1 2t\sin(t^2)\sin(t^2y^2)\,dy $ $A'(t) = \int_0^1 t(\cos(t^2-t^2y^2)-\cos(t^2+t^2y^2))\,dy $ $A'(t) = \int_0^1 t(\cos(t^2(1-y^2))-\cos(t^2(1+y^2)))\,dy $ $A'(t) = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{\sin(t^2(1-y^2))}{1-y^2}-\frac{\sin(t^2(1+y^2))}{y^2+1})\,dy $ $A'(t) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\int_0^1 \frac{\sin(t^2(1-y^2))}{1-y^2}-\frac{\sin(t^2(1+y^2))}{y^2+1} \, dy $ By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $\int A'(t)\,dt + C = A(t)$ If we take the limit as $\lim_{t\to 0}$ : EDIT: $\lim_{t\to 0} \int{A'(t)dt} + C = \lim_{t\to 0}A(t)$ $\lim_{t\to 0} \int{A'(t)dt} = 0$ and $\lim_{t\to 0}A(t) = 0$ So $0 + C = 0$ and $C=0$ Thus, $\int A'(t)\,dt = A(t)$ , But, if we take the limit as $\lim_{t\to \infty}$ : EDIT: $\lim_{t\to \infty} \int{A'(t)dt} = \lim_{t\to \infty}A(t)$ I haven't been able to confirm it, but I am pretty sure from numerical calculations that $\lim_{t\to \infty} \int{A'(t)dt} = 0$ . But we know that $\lim_{t\to \infty}A(t)$ should be $\pi/8$ . And $0\neq \pi/8$ . I may have made a simple algebra or calculus mistake, but I haven't caught it.

1293667,How to make a topology out of $N$ that involves convergent / divergent sets.,"Let $N$ be the naturals $1, 2, \dots$  Call a subset $A$ of $N$ convergent if the reciprocal sum $\sum_{a \in A} \frac{1}{a}$ converges.  Similarly call as set divergent if the sum diverges.  Notice that in this context, since it involves only positive numbers, a set is either convergent or divergent. Define a topology on $N$ by defining the closed sets to be convergent sets. Clearly arbitrary intersections are convergent as well.  Let $A, B$ be two convergent sets, then $A \cup B$ is also a convergent set. Does this mean that the open sets are precisely the divergent sets?","['sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'general-topology']"
1293669,Computing the value of a series by telescoping cancellations vs. infinite limit of partial sums,"$$\sum_{m=5}^\infty \frac{3}{m^2+3m+2}$$ Given this problem my first approach was to take the limit of partial sums. To my surprise this didn't work. Many expletives later I realized it was a telescoping series. My question is why my first approach failed . My expectation is that both approaches would produce the same answer. Why didn't they? First approach: $$\sum_{m=5}^\infty \frac{3}{m^2+3m+2} = \lim \limits_{N \to \infty} \int_{m=5}^N \frac{3}{m^2+3m+2} = \lim \limits_{N \to \infty} 3 \left [ \ln \left ( \frac{N+1}{N+2} \right ) + \ln \left ( \frac{7}{6} \right ) \right ]$$$$ = 3 \ln(7/6) \approx 0.46245$$ An empirical check showed that the above approach is wrong. After I realized it was a telescoping series I was able to produce a sequence of partial sums: $$S_{m} = \left ( \frac{3}{6}-\frac{3}{m+2} \right ) $$ And the limit of this sequence gets to an answer that agrees with a crude empirical spreadsheet validation: $$\lim \limits_{m \to \infty} \left ( \frac{3}{6}-\frac{3}{m+2} \right ) = \frac{1}{2}$$ So clearly my initial intuition and understanding was wrong. But why was it wrong? I thought I could take the limit of an integral to calculate the value of a series. In what case do we apply the first approach I took? I've used it before, but I must have forgotten how to apply it correctly (and all my searches come up with references to computing convergence, not actual values).","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'limits']"
1293685,Is this enough to explain why set theory work in real analysis?,"Sorry for starting a lot of topics in set theory; I think this will be my last. I just want to know what are the basics I need to know about set theory to mathematical analysis. Is what I have written below enough for set theory in relation to real analysis, and will it ensure that I only work with sets, and not so-called proper classes? And also, is what I write correct or wrong? 
I know almost nothing about ZF axiomatic theory and have no time to learn it right now, or even learn logic properly. If we only use the basic set operations, like union, intersection, complement, difference, Cartesian-product, and also the axiom of choice, and only use these operations to create new sets on collections we already know are sets, we will not get any paradoxes or contradictions? (I assume in order to prove all of this you have to study a lot of logic and deep set theory, so I do not need a proof.) In real analysis we sometimes meet very big sets, like the set of all functions on a given space, etc. The reason these sets are allowed to exist, is because if we look at the definition of a function as a relation, and the definition of a relation as a set, then all these big sets we meet in mathematical analysis can be created using known sets, and the basic operations in (1)? Hence they can exist without giving paradoxes like Russel's Paradox (but again, in order to prove this you probably need to study deep set theory). Is this correct? The real numbers, and all the Euclidean vector spaces we work with are sets without paradoxes, because they are created by the basic operations described earlier of the natural numbers. And the collection of natural numbers is a set without paradoxes because it is easily defined using the basic set operations in (1)? (In this case you also need the axiom of infinity). In summary, is the reason they don't encounter set-theory paradoxes in ""ordinary mathematics"" the fact that all their big sets (like the function spaces) can be shown to be created using the set operations on smaller sets like the natural numbers/real numbers, and it is proven in advanced set theory, that if you follow these rules, you do not get paradoxes?",['elementary-set-theory']

1293728,What is the intuition of why convergence in distribution does not imply convergence in probability,"For me its very counter intuitive (that convergence in Probability and Distribution are not the same), because, conceptually, if two random variables have the same distribution, then they should be considered the same random variable. I know this is wrong. I am not sure why but its wrong (hence the question). Maybe, does it mean they are the same (isomorphic) w.r.t. to their pdf/cdf/pmf? Anyway, I want to understand why I am wrong and fix my mathematical intuition. The reason I am complaining is because I am completely aware of a counter example. In fact I will provide it in the appendix of this question, however, even after seeing the counter example, I am not sure I could have come up with it. In fact even after seeing a counter example, it still feels wrong. I was wondering if someone could provide a way of how one would come up with such a counter example (or maybe a counter example that is much more obvious), or maybe explain to me why it should be obvious that one can come up with such a counter example. Appendix: Recall the definitions of convergence in distribution and convergence in probability: Convergence in distribution (D):
$$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} | F_{X_n}(x) - F(x)| = 0, \forall x \in X$$ Convergence in probability (P) for sufficiently large $N$ and $\forall \epsilon > 0$: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} Pr[ | X_n - X | \geq \epsilon]= 0$$ i.e. if one goes sufficiently far the sequence of random variables, then, $X_n$ will converge to $X$ (in probability). I will show the counter example for: $$D \not\implies P$$ Consider a Bernoulli random variable $X$ with probability of success $\frac{1}{2}$. Now define $X_n$ to be equal to $X$, i.e. $$X_n = X$$ Therefore, obviously since they are the same r.v. they have the same distribution. Now define: $$Y = 1 - X$$ Obviously, $Y$ has the same distribution as $X$ and hence, also as $X_n$. So $X_N$ converges in distribution to $Y$. But, do they converge in probability? If they do then: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} Pr[ | X_n - Y | \geq \epsilon]= 0$$ i.e. we want their difference to be larger than $\epsilon$ very rarely (in fact we want that event to have zero probability zero as n goes to infinity). Let's figure out the distance between these two random variables $X_n$ and $Y$: $$| X_n - Y | = |X_N - (1 - X)| = |X -  1 + X| = |2X - 1| = 1$$ Therefore, their distance is always 1, no matter what. We want their distance to be very far for any $\epsilon$, but notice that for the choice of $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$, that the distance between $| X_n - Y | = 1$ is indeed greater than the tolerable threshold (i.e. $1 = | X_n - Y | > \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} $ with probability 1). So for sure their distance is more than $\epsilon$. It doesn't matter what value of $n$ we choose (i.e. it doesn't matter how far we go down the sequence), they are for sure too far apart. More precisely: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}Pr[ | X_n - Y | \geq \epsilon ] = Pr[ 1 \geq \frac{1}{2} ] = 1 $$ which is the opposite of what we need for convergence in probability.

  $$\nabla^2 u =0 \ \ \ \   for \ \ \ 0<a<r<b\ \ \  ,\ \ \ 0<\theta <\frac \pi 2$$
  $$u(r,0)=0,\ \  u(r,\frac \pi 2)=f(r),\ \  u(a,\theta)=u(b,\theta)=0$$ My question pertains to the ODE for $G(r)$, found after separation $u=G(r) \Theta (\theta)$ and how this affects the solution to the overall PDE. $$r^2 G_{rr} + rG_r - \lambda G = 0$$ $$\lambda = -(\frac{n\pi}{ln b/a})^2$$ where $\lambda$ has been derived in the post. I've run into a wall with this separated radial ODE. I've actually finished this entire problem and reached the back of the book answer, but I found some beguiling cases that seem to flaw the solution. To see the cases, please scroll down. The answer in the back of the book does not seem to take into account these other cases, and I want to see if all cases simplify into the same answer or not. Here's my general solution to the ODE with $\lambda$ substituted in the second line: $$G(r) = A\cos\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|} \ln r\right) + B\sin\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|} \ln r\right)$$ $$ = A\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right) + B\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right)$$ Here are the boundary conditions, $G(b)=G(a)=0$: $$A\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln a\right) + B\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln a\right) = 0$$
$$A\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln b\right) + B\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln b\right) = 0$$ EDIT2: Solving $\lambda$, where $\lambda <0$ proven elsewhere. From the BCs above note that
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|}\ln a\right) & \sin\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|} \ln a\right) \\ 
    \cos\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|} \ln b\right) & \sin\left(\sqrt{|\lambda|} \ln b\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    A\\
B
\end{bmatrix} =0
$$
$$\implies \sin(\sqrt{|\lambda|} ln(b/a)) = 0 \implies \lambda = -(\frac{n\pi}{ln b/a})^2$$ Here's where the issue arises: I need to resolve the coeffcients of G(r). Can I put $A$ in terms of $B$ without creating multiple cases? If the terms were nonzero, it'd be easy. We'd use either equation (say the top one) to derive $$A = -B\tan\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln a\right)$$ which eventually leads to $$G(r) = C\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r/a\right)$$ This last line leads to the back of the book answer (scroll down, see CASE1). But it's not clear if we are actually permitted to divide our terms and get $A = -B\tan\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln a\right)$! What if a term was zero? The terms cannot be simultaneously zero, since sine and cosine are orthogonal, but suppose one of them, say $\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln a\right)=0$. Then $B=0$ and we get CASE2 $$G(r) = A\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right) $$ But then the remaining BC gives a funny result $$G(b) = A\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln b\right) = 0$$ $\implies n\pi\frac{\ln b}{\ln b/a} = \frac{\pi}{2}(2k+1)$ for a nontrivial solution. But... that depends on the value of $b$!!! It doesn't appear that $b$ always has to satisfy this... does it? This has me scratching my head. UPDATE: SRX's answer clarifies this point. This makes sense. There is similarly a CASE3 with $G(r) = B\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right) $. What's left to find out is whether or not these cases simplify to the same overall solution. Or, whether we need cases at all! The solution to the azimuthal ODE is $\Theta (\theta) = \sinh(\frac{n \pi \theta}{\ln b/a})$. Take my word for it. This gives three cases of solutions: CASE1: $$u_1(r,\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r/a\right) \sinh \left(\frac{n \pi \theta}{\ln b/a}\right)$$
  $$C_n \sinh \left(\frac{n \pi^2}{2\ln (b/a)}\right) = \frac{2}{\ln(b/a)} \int^b_a f(r) \sin \left(n \pi \frac{\ln (r/a)}{\ln (b/a)}\right) \frac{dr}{r}$$ CASE2: $$u_2(r,\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right) \sinh \left(\frac{n \pi \theta}{\ln b/a}\right)$$ CASE3 $$u_3(r,\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B_n\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{\ln b/a} \ln r\right) \sinh \left(\frac{n \pi \theta}{\ln b/a}\right)$$ As mentioned earlier, only CASE1 appears in the back of the textbook as an answer. The coefficients were found after applying the final BC $u(r,\frac \pi 2) = f(r)$ and taking a weighted inner product with weight $1/r$. I'll exclude the work for now and only cite the result for CASE1. The coefficient relations for $A_n$ and $B_n$ don't seem to work out very nicely. I had issues with them and will need to re-explore those. Am I crazy, or does this problem split into these three separate solutions? I see how, physically speaking, CASE1 is of greatest interest as it would occur more commonly, but what about CASES 2 and 3?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
