111749,How to interpret a double integral,"If you have an integral $\int_c^{d}\int_{a}^{b} f(x_1,x_2)\,dx_2\, dx_1$. I am not sure how to visualize this.I know that you are adding two dimensional rectangles but I cannot see the relationship between the formula and the visualization. Do you basically add all the rectangles in the x2 direction first and get a function of x1 and then add all the rectangles in the x2 direction to get a function of x2? It's easy to interpret a single variable integral but I am not sure what's actually being done in a double integral.I know it's the volume under a particular function in the xyz plane but I cannot determine the ""algorithm"" that is performed to actually compute that volume.",['multivariable-calculus']
111757,Is there a converse for the following Theorem? Equivalent systems of linear equations have exactly the same solutions,"On page $5$ of Linear Algebra from Hoffman and Kunze's book they prove the following Theorem: Theorem 1. Equivalent systems of linear equations have exactly the same solutions I will add the definition of equivalent system of linear equations. Two systems of linear equations are equivalent if each equation in
  each system is a linear combination of the equations in the other
  system. I was wondering if the converse is true. The converse appears to be true, but maybe I am missing something. All examples that I found (systems having exactly the same solutions), the systems were equivalent. I think I am missing something trivial!",['linear-algebra']
111758,"If $A$ is compact, is then $f(A)$ compact?","I just got my exam back, and I still cannot understand this question: Given a continuous function $f:A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, show that if $A$ is a compact set, then its image, $f(A)$, is also compact. I know that a set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is compact if every sequence in $A$ has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in $A$, and I know that a function $f$ is continuous on $A$ if for every $(x_n)\subseteq A$ such that $x_n\to c\in A$, it follows that $f(x_n)\to f(c)$. Therefore, all that I need to do is show that for every $(y_n)\subseteq f(A)$, there is a subsequence $(y_{n_k})$ such that $y_{n_k}\to y\in f(A)$. Can I then make the assumption that for any sequence $(y_n)\subseteq f(A)$, there is a sequence $(x_n)\subseteq A$ such that $y_n=f(x_n)$? If so, I could then continue by stating that since $A$ is compact, there is a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ such that $x_{n_k}\to x\in A$, and since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_{n_k})\to f(x)$. I believe that this yields the required subsequence $(y_{n_k})$ of $(y_n)$ such that $y_{n_k}=f(x_{n_k})\to f(x)=y\in f(A)$. What do you guys think? Is this a sound approach?

111809,Inequality relating diameter of the image of a holomorphic function on the unit disk to the derivative at 0. [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Closed 11 years ago . Possible Duplicate: First derivative bounded by supremum of difference of values in disc Let $f$ be holomorphic in the disk $D_1(0)$ and let $d=\operatorname{diam}(f(D_1(0))$. I want to show that $$2|f'(0)|\leq d$$ I have the following: Let $\gamma$ be the circle of radius $r<1$ traversed counter-clockwise. Let $-\gamma$ be the same circle traversed clockwise. By Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives, we have that $$f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(\theta)}{\theta^2}d\theta=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-\gamma}\frac{f(\theta)}{\theta^2}d\theta=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(-\theta)}{\theta^2}d\theta$$ So $$\begin{align}
2f'(0) &=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(\theta)-f(-\theta)}{\theta^2} \; d\theta\\
\end{align}$$ and by the standard estimate $$\begin{align}
2|f'(0)| &=|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(\theta)-f(-\theta)}{\theta^2}d\theta|\\
&\leq \frac{1}{2\pi}\max_{\theta \in \gamma}\{|\frac{f(\theta)-f(-\theta)}{\theta^2}|\}2\pi r\\
&\leq r\max_{\theta \in \gamma}\{|\frac{f(\theta)-f(-\theta)}{\theta^2}|\}

111810,Isometries of the Plane - Stabiliser of a Line and Further Discussions,"I'm trying to determine the stabilizer of a line in a plane when acted upon by the group of isometries of the plane. Please note that I'm using the notation found in the Wikipedia article on Euclidean plane isometries . I've identified (and hopefully exhausted) the following isometries that will 'fix' a line $l$ set-wise . For the point-wise case, clearly only the identity transformation will work. The identity transformation Rotation about a point on the line by $\pi$ radians, i.e. $R_{c,\pi}$ for any point $c$ on the line $l$ . I think this can also be expressed as $R_{c,\pi}=T_cR_{\pi}T_{-c}$ Translation in a direction parallel to the line, i.e. $T_v$ where $v$ is a vector parallel to $l$ Reflection about $l$ itself, i.e. $F_{\alpha,u}$ for any $\alpha$ lying on $l$ , $u$ perpendicular to $l$ Reflection about any line perpendicular to $l$ , i.e. $F_{\beta, v}$ for any $\beta$ in the plane, with $v$ parallel to $l$ I can't think of any more, but if I've missed any out, I'd be very grateful to learn of them. This leads me into my questions: How can I 'formally' express the response to the given question: The group G of isometries of the plane acts on the set of lines in the plane. Determine

111844,measure preserving transformations on the ternary Cantor set,"I'm working on a project where I define a new sort of measure defined as the following: $$m_\phi(E)=m(\phi^{-1}(E))\;,$$ where $E \subset C$ for the ternary Cantor set $C$. Mind you that $$\phi: \text{binary sequences in}\ [0,1] \rightarrow C\;.$$ This measure is defined for the following $\sigma$-algebra: $$\mathcal{M_\phi}= \{E \subset C \mid \phi^{-1}(E) \in \mathcal{M}\}\;,$$ where $\mathcal{M}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets. Keeping the ternary Cantor set $C$ as my ""universe,"" I built a measure space $(C, \mathcal{M_\phi}, m_\phi)$ from which I concluded that $m_\phi(C)= 1$. So this means that the measure space I built is in fact a probability measure space. My question is how could I construct a measure-preserving transformation for my measure space? I did read and got some basic ideas relating to what measure-preserving transformations are in general, but so far it seems I'm getting almost nowhere. Could this transformation perhaps be some sort of fractional linear map or group action? I did read somewhere that $C$ could be taken as the set of $2$-adic integers, so perhaps I could relate my measure to $2$-adic measure, but how do we account for convergence when it comes to the set of $2$-adic integers?","['measure-theory', 'cantor-set']"

111938,Distributions of Stochastic Processes,"I learned that Brownian motion is any stochastic process $(W_{t})_{t\geq0}$  that satisfies four well-known properties. But I still don't understand how these four properties uniquely determine Brownian Motion. The four properties are $W_0=0$, for times $ 0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2 <...< t_n <T$ the random variables $W_{t_2} - W_{t_1}$, $W_{t_3}-W_{t_2}$,...,$W_{t_n}-W_{t_{n-1}}$ are independent.

More precisely, Let $(W_{t})_{t\geq0}$  and $(W_{t}')_{t\geq0}$  be two stochastic processes that satisfy the four properties of a Brownian motion. Prove that these stochastic processes must then have the same finite dimensional distributions, that is, $E[f(W_{t_{1}},...,W_{t_{n}})]=E[f(W_{t_{1}}^{'},...,W_{t_{n}}^{'})]$ for any $n\geq1$ , $t_{1},...,t_{n}\geq0$ , and bounded measurable $f:\,\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ .

111964,"Is there any recursive definition, using only addition, of the set of values of $x^2+y^2$?","There is a recursive definition of the set of squares which uses only addition: $CS(x,y) := IS(x) \wedge IS(y) \wedge x \lt y \wedge \forall z: (x

\wedge (\forall z: (y < z \wedge z < x) ⇒ \neg IS(z))
\wedge x + z = y + y + 2)$ ($IS$ stands for IsSquare, $CS$ stands for ConsecutiveSquares.) Expanding $CS$ in terms of $IS$ gives an axiom in the language: $IS(x) ⇔x=0 \vee x=1 \vee \exists y: \exists z:

Formally I am considering Presburger arithmetic with a unary predicate and associated axioms, yielding an incomplete system in this case . There are other unary predicates which result in a complete theory.  But my question is: Is there any recursive definition, using only addition, of the set of values of $x^2+y^2$ ?  If so, does it yield an incomplete system?  Otherwise, how to prove that such a definition does not exist?

111981,Apparent contradiction using Mayer-Vietoris for Sheaf cohomology,"Trying to solve Exercise 2.7 b) of Chapter III of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry I got stucked about an apparent contradiction. The exercise asks to prove that $H^1(S^1, \mathcal{R})=0$, where $S^1$ is the circle with its usual topology and $\mathcal{R}$ is the sheaf of continuous real-valued functions. I thought to apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the cohomology with support to the closed subsets of $S^1$: $U:=\{(cos\theta, sen\theta): \theta \in [o,\pi]\},$ $V:=\{(cos\theta, sen\theta): \theta \in [\pi,2\pi]\},$ Their intersection is the pair of points $\{(1,0),(-1,0)\}$. We observe that $\mathcal{R}$ is a flasque sheaf (i.e. if $U\subseteq V$ are open sets then the restriction map $\mathcal{R}(V) \rightarrow  \mathcal{R}(U)$ is a surjection, thanks to Exercise 2.3 c) of the same Chapter, all the cohomology group of grade greater than $0$ computed on a flasque sheaf are trivial. This would solve the exercise by itself but just keep thinking in this direction for a moment...). 
And we recall that $H^0_Y(X,\mathcal{F})=\Gamma_Y(X,\mathcal{F})$ we get the (short) exact sequence: $0 \rightarrow \Gamma_{U \cap V}(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \rightarrow \Gamma_U(S^1, \mathcal{R})\oplus\Gamma_V(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \rightarrow \Gamma(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \rightarrow 0.$ Taking a closer look to the groups involved I noticed that $\Gamma_{U \cap V}(S^1, \mathcal{R})\simeq 0$ because the germ of a continuous function on a point which is zero outside of that point must be zero also on the point, by continuity. For the other terms $\Gamma_U(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \simeq \Gamma_V(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \simeq \mathcal{C}([0,1])_{\partial=0}$ the group of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ which are zero on the boundary. And $\Gamma(S^1, \mathcal{R}) \simeq \mathcal{C}([0,1])_{per}$ the group of continuos functions on $[0,1]$ such that $f(0)=f(1)$. By the sequence above we deduce that $\mathcal{C}([0,1])_{per} \simeq \mathcal{C}([0,1])_{\partial=0}\oplus \mathcal{C}([0,1])_{\partial=0}$. But really I don't see it (I tried to do something with Borsuk-Ulam theorem but the matter is I don't think it is true). Can someone please explain where my error lies?

So we can find the torsion points a bit easily by using  theorem of Nagell and Lutz. My main question is that How can we find the free part ? ( I mean points of infinite order ) . I have read that we can just use the homogeneous spaces ( Torsors ) and just dig for some points with infinite order. But its well known that they are not such efficient methods that apply universally and work every time. So  are there any other known ( Efficient ) methods for computing the points of infinite order ? , apart from using Homogeneous spaces. P.S : Apart from this, giving rational points on the original elliptic curve corresponds to giving sections of the projection $S \to C$ ( where $S$ is elliptic surface over curve $C$ ). To determine such sections essentially amounts to determining all the curves lying on $S$ that can be defined over $\mathbb F$ ( where $F$ is a finite field where $C$ lies ). So is there any anagolous way of finding the points of infinite order by considering the associated surfaces. Is there any work done in that direction ?

112043,Continuous Functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$,"The following is not a homework problem. I am doing it for self study. Prove that any continuous function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is constant. Here is my proof: Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be such a function. ? We first show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is disconnected. Let $p$ be an irrational number. Then we can write $\mathbb{Q}$ as $$ \big( \mathbb{Q} \cap (-\infty,p) \big) \cup \big( \mathbb{Q} \cap (p,\infty) \big),  $$ which is a disconnection of $\mathbb{Q}$ . Moreover, $\mathbb{Q}$ is also totally disconnected, as any open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ must contain two rational numbers and there is always an irrational number between the two, and we can use that rational number to create a disconnection. Therefore the only connected subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ are the singleton sets $\{q\}$ , where $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ , which are closed. We will show that $f(\mathbb{R})$ must be connected. Assume not, then $$ f(\mathbb{R})= U\cup V, $$ where $U$ and $V$ are nonempty open subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$ U \cap V= \emptyset .$$ This implies $$
\mathbb{R} = f^{-1} \big( U \cup V \big) = f^{-1}(U)\cup f^{-1}(V), 
$$ where $f^{-1}(U),f^{-1}(V)$ are nonempty, nonintersecting subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ . This, however, is a contradiction, as $\mathbb{R}$ is connected. Therefore no such set $U$ and $V$ can exist. As we have already shown, the only connected subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ are the singleton sets $\{q\}$ , so $f(\mathbb{R})$ must be such a set.

112294,Arbitrary Union and Intersection of Closed and Open Sets,"I have four quick questions and have listed them below. I am seeking for corroboration of the first three and a bit of insight on the fourth, as I have hit a solid brick wall. Definition. A set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is called an $F_\sigma$ set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set $B\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is called a $G_\delta$ set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. 1. Argue that a set $A$ is a $G_\delta$ set if and only if its complement is an $F_\sigma$ set. Proof. Let $A$ be a $G_\delta$ set. Then$$A=\bigcap_{n=1}K_n,$$where each $K_n$ is an open set. By De Morgan's law, it follows that$$A^c=\left(\bigcap_{n=1}K_n\right)^c=\bigcup_{n=1}K_n^c,$$which is an $F_\sigma$ set, since it is a countable union of closed sets. The converse statement can be proven in a similar fashion. $\square$ 2. Show that a closed interval $[a,b]$ is a $G_\delta$ set. Proof. Take$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\left(a-\frac{1}{n},b+\frac{1}{n}\right)=[a,b].$$Therefore, $[a,b]$ is a $G_\delta$ set. $\square$ 3. Show that the half-open interval $(a,b]$ is both a $G_\delta$ and an $F_\sigma$ set. Proof. Take$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\left(a,b+\frac{1}{n}\right)=(a,b],$$and$$\bigcup_{n=4}^\infty\left[a-\frac{a-b}{n},b\right]=(a,b].$$Therefore, $(a,b]$ is both a $G_\delta$ and an $F_\sigma$ set. $\square$ 4. Show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set, and the set of irrationals $\mathbb{I}$ forms a $G_\delta$ set. I am oblivious as to how to tackle this problem. I know that I need to show that $\mathbb{Q}$ can be written as the countable union of closed sets, and that upon doing this, I can apply De Morgan's law to it to prove the second statement. However, I do not know how to begin. Do you guys have any ideas? Thanks in advance! Edit 1: I followed Robert's advice, and this is what I managed to weave: Proof. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, we can write it as $\mathbb{Q}=\{r_1,r_2,r_3,\cdots\}$, where each $r_n$ is a unique rational number. It follows that we can express $\mathbb{Q}$ as the union of singletons $[r_n]$, which are closed sets, as follows:$$\mathbb{Q}=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty[r_n].$$Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}$ is an $F_\sigma$ set, since it is a countable union of closed sets. Furthermore, it naturally follows that$$\mathbb{I}=\mathbb{Q}^c=\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty[r_n]\right)^c=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty[r_n]^c=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty(-\infty,r_n)\cup(r_n,\infty)$$is a $G_\delta$ set, since it is a countable intersection of open sets. $\square$ Is this sound?",['real-analysis']
112299,Is there a name for a matrix where the column space equals the row space? Does it have any interesting properties?,"I sat down to write a linear algebra take-home exam problem where I would give a $4\times4$ matrix $A$ and ask for bases for these six spaces: $\mathrm{Col}\,A$, $\mathrm{Row}\,A$, $\mathrm{Nul}\,A$, $\mathrm{Col}\,A^t$, $\mathrm{Row}\,A^t$, $\mathrm{Nul}\,A^t$. Trivially, a basis for $\mathrm{Col}\,A$ will work for $\mathrm{Row}\,A^t$, and likewise with $\mathrm{Row}\,A$ and $\mathrm{Col}\,A^t$; that was meant to be part of the test. I expected $\mathrm{Nul}\,A$ and $\mathrm{Nul}\,A^t$ to be different. I worked on the first $4\times4$ matrix that came to mind: $\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3&4\\5&6&7&8\\9&10&11&12\\13&14&15&16\end{bmatrix}$. To my surprise, the standard method for finding the basis of the null space led me to see that in this case, $\mathrm{Nul}\,A=\mathrm{Nul}\,A^t$. (And since I do not want students to think this will always be the case, I have to try a different matrix.) As a consequence of the orthogonality of row and null spaces, $\mathrm{Row}\,A=\mathrm{Row}\,A^t$. So we have a matrix where: $$\mathrm{Col}\,A^t=\mathrm{Row}\,A=\mathrm{Row}\,A^t=\mathrm{Col}\,A$$ $$\mathrm{Nul}\; A=\mathrm{Nul}\;A^t$$ all of which is equivalent to just knowing $$\mathrm{Row}\, A=\mathrm{Col}\,A$$
or to just knowing $$\mathrm{Nul}\, A=\mathrm{Nul}\,A^t$$And these are equivalent to the existence of a matrix $B$ such that $AB=A^t$, since the rows of $A$ (columns of $A^t$) are linear combinations of the columns of $A$. Now any invertible matrix would automatically have these properties, since the null space of an invertible matrix is $\{\vec0\}$. And any symmetric matrix will automatically have these properties, since $A=A^t$. But it seems like a noninvertible, asymmetric square matrix will rarely have these properties. (In the $2\times 2$ case, there are none.) With general $n\times n$ matrices again, I would like to know Is there a name for this kind of matrix ($\mathrm{Row}\,A=\mathrm{Row}\,A^t$)? Perhaps additionally demanding noninvertible asymmetric specimens? Does this kind of matrix have any interesting applications?

If I lose, I will keep playing until I win. Once I win, I leave the game. Otherwise, I continue to play until 30 rounds and leave the game even if I don't win. In other words, I will just stop at the $30$th round. Each round is independent and the probability of winning in each round is $\frac{9}{13}$. I let $X$ be a random variable of my winnings. I want to find my expected winnings. Since it works in a way that I would stop during my first win, I have a feeling that $X$ should be distributed over the Geometric Distribution. The game is either a win or a lose, so it is pretty much like a Bernoulli trial. But since I am not getting the expected number of rounds played, the Bernoulli trials cannot be just $0$ or $1$. So I thought I could modify it to become this way:
$$
{ X }_{ j }=\left\{\begin{matrix}
+2^{j-1} & if\;  win\\ 
-2^{j-1} & if\;  lose
\end{matrix}\right.
$$
Then, $E(X)=E(X_1+X_2+\cdots +X_{30})=E(X_1)+E(X_2)+\cdots +E(X_{30})$ However, because I thought this is a Geometric Distribution, the expected value is just $\frac{1}{p}=\frac{13}{9}$. But I don't think the expected winnings is $\frac{13}{9}$ and is wrong. Is what I have done correct? So, instead of the usual finding of the expected number of trials of a standard geometric distribution, how can I find an expected number of another factor due to the trials (in this case, the expected number of winnings from the trials)?

Show that $A\in \mathcal{F}_{t_0}^X$, where the latter is defined as, $\mathcal{F}_{t_0}^X:=\sigma{(\{X_s;0\le s\le t_0\})}$ What I did (sketch): Write $A$ as, $$ A=\{\omega \in \Omega; \lim_{s\uparrow t}X_s(\omega)=\lim_{s\downarrow t}X_s(\omega)\}$$ for $t\in [0,t_0)$. Since the Limit of a sequence of measurable functions is measurable, this is in $\mathcal{F}_{t_0}^X$. For more details see the answer of Byron Schmuland below. Now here's the part which is unclear.

112543,Continuous variation from solution of one problem to solution of another problem,"This is a differential equations question.  The only thing I know about differential equations
is that there can be many subtleties. Suppose that I have a function $g:\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
I have a solution $x_0$ to $g(x_0, t=0)=0$.  I desire to show the existence of a solution
to $g(x_1, t=1)=0$.  My strategy is to take the known solution $x_0$ and vary it
from $t=0$ to $t=1$. Let $J$ be the Jacobian $J_{ij} = \partial g_i / \partial x_j$.  Define the function
$f(x,t) = - J^{-1} \partial g/\partial t$.  Then, setting $dx/dt = f(x,t)$ gives
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dg(x,t)}{dt} = J \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = 0.
\end{equation}
So it would seem that integrating this differential equation from $t=0$ to $t=1$ will lead to the
desired solution $g(x_1, t=1)=0$. What I need then is a theorem of the following form: Suppose $g(x_0, t=0)=0$, and suppose that $\exists f$ such that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x,t) \implies \frac{dg(x,t)}{dt}=0.
\end{equation}
If $f$ and $g$ are well behaved enough in the vicinity $g(x,t) \approx 0$, then $\exists x$ such that $g(x,1)=0$. When $g(x,t)=0$, I have a lower bound on the smallest singular value of $J$,
and $\partial g/\partial t$ is bounded as well.  So, in this case $f$ is bounded.
In fact, I think that I can pretty much
prove any needed type of ""well-behavedness"" in the region $\left| g(x,t) \right| < \epsilon$
for some $\epsilon$.  So, what properties of $f$ and $g$ are needed, and what theorem
will help me here?  It looks like Picard-Lindelof may help, but it seems to only give
the existence of a unique solution to the differential equation, and I need to show that
that solution satisfies $g(x_1, t=1)=0$.  Furthermore, $f$ is not well behaved when $g$ is far from zero, and so it seems I cannot use Picard-Lindelof without prior assumption that $g(x,t)$ stays small (which is kind of assumes the fact that I am trying to prove).

And a corollary: is the answer to that question different for a different number base (such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal)? The common-sense answer to both questions would be ""no"".

Now considering $ a_n^{2} \ge\frac {|a_n|}{n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $\frac {|a_n|}{n} \le a_n^{2}$ $\rightarrow$ combining the two cases for any n we have: $\frac {|a_n|}{n}\le\frac{1}{n^{2}}+a_n^{2}$ Hence using the comparion test again we know that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1}{n^{2}}$ converges hence the sum converges so we can conclude that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {a_n}{n}$ is absoluetly convergent $\Rightarrow$ convergent. 
Not to sure if this is correct, any help would be much appreciated, many thanks.","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
112583,Complementary Solution = Homogenous solution?,"I have calculated solutions to homogenous equations but is the complementary solution mentioned here the same as the homogenous solution? Let's take example $y''-3y'+2y=\cos(wx)$ and now the homogenous solution is $$y_{hom}=C_{1}e^{2x}+C_{2}e^{x}_{|\text{Characteristic eq. =}(r-1)(r-2)}$$ which can be showed with Wronk's determinant to be valid (cannot yet understand it but go on). Now to find out the general solution there are multiple ways apparently: Method of Undetermined Coefficient Variation of constant I have not practised them yet enough (because cannot understand the terms yet) so cannot ask much about them but I am trying to, could someone help me with the terminology here about the complementary solution ?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'terminology']"
112585,"If $\alpha\leq \beta,\gamma\leq \delta$ then $\alpha+\gamma\leq \beta+\delta$","The title is one of my homework assigments, (and the above greek letters are ordinal numbers) but this is the first one containing inequalities, and I dont really know how to do it. My guess is induction, and I think this might be a way to do it: First we prove that $\alpha\leq \beta$ imply that $\alpha+\gamma \leq \beta +\gamma$: Induction on $\gamma$. If $\gamma=0$ then the statement is trivial. Now assume that the statement holds for all $x<\gamma$. If $\gamma$ is a succesor, then there exists a $y$ such that $Sy=\gamma$, then:$$\alpha+\gamma=S(\alpha+y)\leq S(\beta+y)=\beta+\gamma$$If $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal, then:$$\alpha+\gamma=\mbox{sup}(\alpha+x: x<\gamma)\leq 
\mbox{sup}(\beta+x: x<\gamma)=\beta+\gamma$$and thus we have that $\alpha+\gamma\leq \beta+\gamma$. Then my idea is to prove that if $\gamma\leq \delta$, then we have that $\beta+\gamma\leq \beta+\delta$ and then the statement would follow. My question: For this last part do we do induction with base case $\delta=\gamma$? and then do the same routine of considering cases when $\delta$ is a limit or a successor. Is there another way to tackle this problem? Thanks!","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
