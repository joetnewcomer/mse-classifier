2058416,Fibonacci cycles for finite groups,"For two elements $A$ and $B$ of a finite group $G$ of order $n$, we may define the Fibonacci cycle $Fib(A,B)$ as the sequence $$Fib(A,B) =\{A,B,BA,BAB,BABBA,BABBABAB, \dots \}$$
Here, starting from the third element, each element in the sequence is obtained by applying the group operation to the preceding two elements. If $A$ and $B$ are both selected to be the identity element $E$, we get a trivial sequence with period 1: $Fib(E,E) =\{E,E,E, \dots \}$. Any other choice for $A$ and $B$ will lead to a Fibonacci cycle with larger period. For instance, if $G$ is the cyclic group of order 3, with elements $E$, $L$ and $R$, a period 8 Fibonacci sequence results:
$$Fib(E,L) = \{E,L,L,R,E,R,R,L,E,L,\dots \}$$
For groups of order 3 it is not possible to create larger cycles. This follows from the fact that the periods of all non-trivial cycles for a given group of order $n$ add up to $n^2-1$. The question now arises: what is the maximum period $\tau_n$ obtainable for finite groups of order $n$?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'group-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2058469,How can we minimize a function of two variables?,"Here we are more interested in the method to minimize the function, rather than what the actual result is. The function I currently have, which I may need to change, is: $$b / d + (1/6 \log{(b)})(1+\log{(b)})(1+2\log{(b)})m/(gd)$$ with: $$b=g \log_2(\log_2{(g)}+d\log_2{(2n^2a^2)}+\log_2{(nm)})$$ Here $a$, $m$, and $n$ are given and known.  I'm interested in knowing the method to find the $d$ and $g$ which minimize the function.  For example, can I simply take the derivative to find the minimum values? My question is, what method can I use to find the minimum values of a function of this type?  Can it be as simple as taking the derivative, assuming that finding the derivative is easy?","['derivatives', 'intuition', 'partial-derivative', 'maxima-minima']"

f'(x) &= \underset{h\rightarrow 0}{\textrm{lim}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\\
\implies \frac{d2^x}{dx} &= \underset{h\rightarrow 0}{\textrm{lim}}\frac{2^{x+h}-2^x}{h}\\
&= \underset{h\rightarrow 0}{\textrm{lim}}\frac{2^x(2^h -1)}{h}

2058578,Integration with respect to sum of signed measures.,"Consider two finite signed measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on a measurable space and a measurable mapping $f$ integrable with respect to both measure. The Jordan-Hahn decomposition yields
$$
\mu= \mu^+ - \mu^-, \quad \quad\text{and} \quad \quad  \nu=\nu^+-\nu^-.
$$
 We know that in general $(\mu+\nu)^+ \not = \mu^+ +\nu^+$ and $(\mu+\nu)^-\not= \mu^-+\nu^-$, but can I say that
$$
\int f d(\mu+\nu) \stackrel{?}{=} \int fd(\mu^++\nu^+) -\int f d(\mu^-+\nu^-).
$$
I have found two counterexamples for $\theta^+  = \mu^+ +\nu^+$ and $\theta^-= \mu^-+\nu^-$, but these examples still satisfy the above equality: $\mu=\delta_a-\delta_b$, $\nu=\delta_b -\delta_c$, such that $(\mu+\nu)^+ =\delta_a \not = \delta_a+\delta_b$ and $(\mu+\nu)^- = \delta_c \not = \delta_b+\delta_c$, but in this case we see that
$$
\int f d(\mu+\nu)= \int f d\delta_a - \int f d\delta_c = \int f d\delta_a +\int f d\delta_b - \int f d\delta_b- \int f d\delta_c
$$
$$
= \int fd(\mu^++\nu^+) - \int f d(\mu^-+\nu^-)
$$
so the equality still holds. Non-zero measures with $\mu=-\nu$, such that $(\mu+\nu)^+=0\not = \mu^++\nu^+$  and $(\mu+\nu)^-=0\not = \mu^-+\nu^-$, but
$$
\int f d(\mu+\nu) =0
$$
and we have that $\mu^+=\nu^-$ and $\mu^-=\nu^+$, yielding that
$$
\int fd\mu^+ -\int f d\mu^-+\int fd\nu^+ -\int fd\nu^- = \int fd\mu^+ -\int f d\mu^-+\int fd\mu^- -\int fd\mu^+ =0,
$$
so equality still holds. This gives me reason to to thinks that the equality holds. Can anyone please help me understand why the equality holds, or at least give me a counterexample for which it does not hold?","['integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

2058610,How to derive the power series solution for Associated Legendre Differential Equation,"This question (similar other questions) have troubled me for last 5 years. Two months ago I thought I would simply solve the Hydrogen Atom problem and see these Associated Legendre Polynomials come to life by themselves. I haven't solved it yet. I began by writing the Schrodinger equation for Hydrogen atom.
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi = E\psi
$$
I followed a well know method of separation of variables.
$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)P(\theta)Q(\phi)$. I plugged it in the above Schrodinger equation. The result was,
$$
\underset{\text{function of r}}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right) + \frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}(E-V)}} 
+ \underset{\text{function of x}}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{P}\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\frac{dP}{dx}\right)
+ \frac{1}{(1-x^2)}\underset{\text{function of }\phi}{\underbrace{\frac{1}{Q}\frac{d^2Q}{d\phi^2}}}}}
= 0
$$ Here $x = \cos\theta$. Now we can proceed step by step to solve it. Step 1. $\frac{1}{Q}\frac{d^2Q}{d\phi^2} = -m^2$ where m is an integer (due to the periodic nature of the $Q(\phi)$). Step 2. This gives us the two following equations,
$$
\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right) + \frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}(E-V) = A
$$ $$
\frac{1}{P}\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\frac{dP}{dx}\right)
- \frac{m^2}{(1-x^2)} = -A
$$
where A is some constant. We have not got a clue about this constant at all this point. I simply am interested in associated Legendre so I went for the later equation. Step 3.
$$
(1-x^2)^2P'' -2x(1-x^2)P' +\left(A(1-x^2) - m^2\right)P = 0
$$
Now this equation can be solved by assuming power series solution of the form,
$P = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} a_j x^j$. Step 4.
When this expansion is plugged into the the Associated Legendre DE I got, $(j+2)(j+1)a_{j+2}+[A-m^2-2j^2]a_j+[(j-2)(j-3)-A]a_{j-2} = 0$ Remembering that $a_j = 0\ \forall\ j<0$ I found few terms,
$$a_2 = -\frac{(A-m^2)}{2\cdot1}a_0$$ $$a_3 = -\frac{(A-m^2-2)}{3\cdot2}a_1$$ $$a_4 = \left[A + \frac{(A-m^2)(A-m^2-8)}{2\cdot1}\right]\frac{a_0}{4\cdot3}$$ $$a_5 = \left[A + \frac{(A-m^2-2)(A-m^2-18)}{3\cdot2}\right]\frac{a_1}{5\cdot4}$$ Now I don't see any pattern emerging through which I could place condition on the constant A.

2058676,On pointwise convergence of Lebesgue measurable sets and some properties,"Definition ( Pointwise convergence of sets ): We say that a sequence $E_n$ of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ converges pointwise to another set $E$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if the indicator functions $1_{E_n}$ converge pointwise to the indicator function $1_E$ . The problem is to show that if $E_n$ are all Lebesgue measurable, and converge pointwise to $E$ , then $E$ is also Lebesgue measurable. Further, I need to show that $m(E_n)$ converges to $m(E)$ [where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure], if $E_n$ are all contained in another Lebesgue measurable set $F$ of finite measure. Also, I've to produce a counter example to show that the convergence may not hold without the assumption. For the first part, I tried to write $E$ as some countable union/intersection of the $E_n$ 's. But I cannot exploit the definition of pointwise convergence of sets well enough to defend my point. For the second part, probably I need to incorporate the monotone convergence theorem, but I don't have a clear-cut attack on the problem.

2058776,Prove $\sum\limits_\text{cyc}\frac{a}{a+(n-1)b}\geq 1$,"For $a_i> 0$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ prove or disprove $$\frac{a_1}{a_1+(n-1) a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_2+(n-1)a_3}+\dots+\frac{a_n}{a_n+(n-1)a_1}\geq 1.$$ Written in a cyclic notation $$
\sum_\text{cyc} \frac{a}{a+(n-1)b} \geq 1.
$$ I have conjectured this one after running into couple similar ones. Perhaps it is known, but I could not find it solved anywhere. For small values of $n$ it apparently holds, for $n=1$ we have:
$$\frac{a}{a} = 1 \geq 1
$$ For $n=2$ it is:
$$
\frac{a}{a+b} + \frac{b}{b+a} = \frac{a+b}{a+b} = 1 \geq 1
$$ For $n=3$ it starts to be interesting:
$$
\frac{a}{a+2b} + \frac{b}{b+2c} + \frac{c}{c+2a} \geq 1
$$
Here the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality seems to do the trick:
\begin{align}
\left(\sum_\text{cyc} \frac{a} {a+2b}\right)\left(\sum_\text{cyc} a(a+2b)\right) &\geq \left(\sum_\text{cyc} a\right)^2\\
\left(\sum_\text{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2b}\right) (a+b+c)^2&\geq (a+b+c)^2 \\
\left(\sum_\text{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2b}\right) &\geq 1
\end{align} However for higher $n$ I'm stuck. I have tried Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, as well as Holder's and Jensen's, but no luck. Also considered induction but it did not lead to anything nice. It appears that the equality holds whenever $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_n$. Also the inequality can be equivalently written in a form \begin{align}
\sum_\text{cyc} \frac{a}{a+(n-1)b} = \sum_\text{cyc}\frac{a+(n-1)b-(n-1)b}{a+(n-1)b} = n-(n-1)\sum_\text{cyc}\frac{b}{a+(n-1)b} &\geq 1\\
\end{align}
so
\begin{align}
1 &\geq \sum_\text{cyc}\frac{b}{a+(n-1)b}.\\
\end{align} Anyone knows how to prove/disprove this for generic $n$?","['inequality', 'a.m.-g.m.-inequality', 'substitution', 'multivariable-calculus', 'contest-math']"

2058955,Subfields of a splitting field using Galois correspondence,"My question concerns the techniques for finding the subfields of a given splitting field using Galois correspondence. I still struggle sometimes with these kind of problems and thus shall ask this question applied to a concrete example. Given the irreducible polynomial $f = X^4 + 4X^2 + 9$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we can denote its roots by $a = \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{-5}}$ $b = -\sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{-5}}$ $c = \sqrt{-2 - \sqrt{-5}}$ $d = -\sqrt{-2 - \sqrt{-5}}$. The splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is given by $L = \mathbb{Q}(a,b,c,d) = \mathbb{Q}(a)$. The elements of the Galois-group are exactly the $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphisms of L, and thus are determined by the image of $a$. If we define $\phi_1 = Id$ $\phi_2: a \mapsto b$ $\phi_3: a \mapsto c$ $\phi_4 = \phi_2 \circ \phi_3: a \mapsto d$ Results in Galois theory yield that the Galois-group of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group $V_4$, which is isomorphic to the direct product of 2$\mathbb{Z}$ with itself. Using Galois-correspondence, one can determine the subgroups of $L$. Obviously, the (non-trivial) subgroups of $G = Gal(f/\mathbb{Q})$ are $H_2 = \left\{Id, \phi_2\right\}$, $H_3 = \left\{Id, \phi_3\right\}$ and $H_4 = \left\{Id, \phi_4\right\}$. What follows is my attempt to find the corresponding subfields of L. The non-trivial subfield of $L$ corresponding to $H_2$ is given by $\mathbb{Q}(a^2)$.  This can be seen by the fact that $\phi_2(a^2) = a^2$. Now, in the same manner one could argue that it can be easily seen that $\mathbb{Q}(a + c)$ and $\mathbb{Q}(b + c)$ are the other subfields of $L$, corresponding with $H_3$ and $H_4$ respectively. Is there a more general way to determine these subfields? One strategy that sometimes seems to work (but not in this particular example), is to determine the $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of L. This basis is equal to $\left\{1, a, a^2, a^3\right\}$. Then, one can see that $\phi_2(v + wa + xa^2 + ya^3) = v - wa + xa^2 - ya^3$  for $v, w, x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$ and thus $\phi_2(a^2) = a^2$, making $\mathbb{Q}(a^2)$ the subfield of $L$ corresponding with $H_2$. If I try the same approach for $\phi_3$ for example, I don't get anything useable. So really my question is, when does this approach work, when doesn't it, is there any more general approach to these kinds of problems?","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'field-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

2059026,Simple normal crossings divisor and locally monomial functions,"Let $X$ be a smooth algebraic variety with $\varphi$ a regular function on $X$. Let $X_0=\varphi^{-1}(0)$ and suppose that $X_0\subset X$ is a reduced, singular subvariety. Let $\pi:\widetilde{X}\to X$ be a strong resolution of the pair $(X,X_0)$. Denote $\widetilde{X}_0=\pi^{-1}(X_0)$. Denote $\widetilde{\varphi}=\varphi\circ\pi$. Since $\widetilde{X}$ is a strong resolution of the pair $(X,X_0)$ we have that $\widetilde{X}_0$ is a simple normal crossings divisor- this means that in a Zariski neighborhood of any point $p\in \widetilde{X}_0$, one may choose coordinates so that the divisor $\widetilde{X}_0$ looks like an intersection of coordinate hyperplanes. This all makes sense to me. Here's where my confusion comes in. I have seen the following claim: there exists a coordinate system near $p$ such that $\widetilde{\varphi}$ is monomial, ie there exist an invertible $\alpha$, coordinates $x_1,\cdots,x_n$, and nonnegative integers $a_1,\cdots,a_n$ such that on a neighborhood of $p$, we have $$\widetilde{\varphi}=\alpha x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}$$ It seems intuitively to me like the proof of this statement should be more or less a one-liner. Unfortunately, the source does not contain it, I can't find that argument elsewhere, and I can't think of any good arguments to prove this. The best I can do is to say the following: Since $\widetilde{\varphi}$ vanishes on $\widetilde{X}_0$, it should be in $I(\widetilde{X}_0)$, which is locally principal, so I can write it as $\sum f_ig$ where $g$ is locally a generator of $I(\widetilde{X}_0)$. I can then collect terms... but this argument seems wrong (what about something like $x^2y+xy^2$, for instance?).

Even at High School, I could have looked at that and thought ""well since you're dealing with infinities and divergent series, those manipulations of $S$ are not valid in the first place so you're really just rearranging falsehoods."" It's a bit like the error in this proof that $1=0$ , or $\forall x.(\text{false}\implies x)$, it's a collapse of logic. Greater minds than mine have shown that $\zeta(-1)=\frac{-1}{12}$ and I have no argument with that, but I do dispute the claim that $\zeta(-1)=S$. My thinking here is that, although the analytic continuation of $\zeta$ is well-defined, that analytic continuation is not the same thing as $\sum_\limits{i=1}^\infty i$. Once you have defined $\zeta(s) =\sum_\limits{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}$ where $\vert s\vert>1$ defined $\zeta^\prime(s)=...$ by analytic continuation for all $s$ then you can only claim $\zeta(s)=\zeta^\prime(s)$ where $\vert s\vert>1$. Basicaly, your nice, differentiable-everywhere definition of the Zeta function is not substituable for the original series $S$ in the unrestricted domain. Hence, $\zeta(-1)=\frac{-1}{12}\nRightarrow S=\frac{-1}{12}$. Right? Convince me otherwise.","['divergent-series', 'riemann-zeta', 'sequences-and-series']"

However, I am aware that Dirac's delta ""function"" is defined as a distribution, not a function in the conventional sense, so there is probably more going on here than meets the untrained eye. So my question is, what caveats are necessary for the above equation for it to be formally correct? Can it be taken literally?

Improve this question Having almost finished an honours calculus sequence, I'm now about to enroll in a real analysis course. I've been buying some interesting books lately on top of my required reading list (for example, I supplemented my Calculus book, which was Peter Lax' ""Calculus With Applications"" , with Mercer's ""More Calculus of a Single Variable"" ), and I'm now faced with the opportunity to buy a book on various Calculus techniques and tricks - Klambauer's ""Aspects of Calculus"" , to be precise - but I'm not sure if working through this book will be worth my time, or if I'd be better served spending my spare time working through some other topic. So, in trying to find an answer to this question, I think it's fair to generalize it and ask instead, how important are ""advanced"" differentiation and integration techniques and tricks to a mathematics major intending to work towards a PhD in mathematics - possibly aspiring to work in academia? I'd imagine such a question leads to different answers depending on what area of mathematics you decide to work in, so I'll leave the area unspecified. Also, I'm aware this question is somewhat similar to this one , but I'm specifically asking about the advanced techniques and tricks as discussed in Klambauer's book, not so much about calculus in general. Klambauer's book is quite particular about what it covers (difficult rational integration examples, hard derivatives, complicated series etc etc). Edit: again, allow me to emphasize that the answers will depend on what area of mathematics one decides to work in. I'm aware of that, and I knowingly and purposefully left the mathematical area unspecified so as to encourage open-ended answers that will end up painting a more complete picture than only focusing on the relevance of advanced differentiation tricks and techniques in just algebraic geometry, for example.","['derivatives', 'calculus', 'integration', 'soft-question', 'education']"

2060083,Proof that a $T_1$ Space has a locally finite basis iff it is discrete,"I'm working my way through Munkres, and I'm having difficulty with exercise 3 of section 40 on the Nagata-Smirnov Metrization Theorem. Many spaces have countable bases; but no $T_1$ space has a locally finite basis unless it is discrete. Prove this fact. I'm able to prove one direction (discrete $\rightarrow$ locally finite basis) easily, without even using the $T1$ property: Let $X$ be a discrete space. Clearly the set of all singletons is a basis for $X$. Therefore, for any point $x \in X$, the set $\{x\}$ is a neighborhood of $x$ which intersects only one basis element, namely itself. That is, $X$ has a locally finite basis. However, the reverse direction (locally finite basis $\rightarrow$ discrete) is proving to be more difficult. My gut tells me that I should make use of theorem 17.9. Let $X$ be a space satisfying the $T_1$ axiom; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Then the point $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ contains infinitely many points of $A$. My attempt so far at proving the contrapositive (not discrete $\rightarrow$ no locally finite basis): Let $X$ be a $T_1$ space which is not discrete. That is, there is at least one point $x \in X$ such that $\{x\}$ is not open. Thus, every neighborhood of $x$ contains points other than $x$, so that $x$ is a limit point of $X - \{x\}$. By theorem 17.9, every neighborhood of $x$ must then contain infinitely many points of $X - \{x\}$. From here, my best guess is that I should suppose $X$ has a locally finite basis and try to find a contradiction, but I'm unclear on how to go about this. Just because some neighborhood of $x$ must intersect only finitely many basis elements doesn't necessarily mean it can't contain infinitely many points. Is this an appropriate direction for me to take?",['general-topology']

Since $E[X_{n} | X_0, \cdots, X_{n-1}] = X_{n-1}$, we have that $X_n$ is a martingale. Also, it is bounded from below by $0$. Using (a version of) Martingale convergence theorem, we can say that $X_n \to X$ with probability $1$, where $X$ is a random variable with finite expectation. Now, in class we argued that $X_n$ cannot converge to any value other than $0$ with positive probability. This can be seen with elementary argument by assuming that it converges to some $a > 0$ with positive probability, and considering an arbitrarily small interval around $a$ to show that that cannot be the case because of the way $X_n$ is defined. However, we then argued that the previous argument implies that $\Pr(X_n \to 0) = 1$. This part is not clear to me, because we can consider a similar argument for $0$, by considering an interval $(0, \epsilon]$ for some $\epsilon$. Note that this was meant as an introduction to Martingales, and we proved the Martingale convergence theorem using ""basic probability"" and ""elementary"" $\epsilon-\delta$ arguments. We do not have any background in measure theory, and we did not base our discussion of Martingales on the foundations of measure theory, which I understand is a standard way of presenting Martingales. My question is, can we show that with probability $1$, $X_n$ converges to $0$ without using sophisticated arguments from measure theory?","['martingales', 'probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"

For a subdivision $\sigma$ of $I$ (i.e. a finite strictly increasing sequence $(x_0,...,x_N)$ with $x_0=a$ and $x_N=b$) we define
$$
\overline{S}_{\sigma}(f)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-x_{i-1})\sup_{x\in[x_{i-1},x_i]}f(x)\\
\underline{S}_{\sigma}(f)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-x_{i-1})\inf_{x\in[x_{i-1},x_i]}f(x)
$$
and thereby
$$
\overline{S}(f)=\inf\{\overline{S}_\sigma(f)\ :\ \sigma\text{ subdivision of } I\}\\
\underline{S}(f)=\sup\{\underline{S}_\sigma(f)\ :\ \sigma\text{ subdivision of } I\}
$$
Using this, we define the space of Riemann integrable functions over $I$, denoted by $\mathcal{R}(I)$, as
$$
\mathcal{R}(I)=\{f:I\to\mathbb{R}\ :\ f \text{ bounded},\ \overline{S}(f)=\underline{S}(f)\}
$$
and for $f\in\mathcal{R}(I)$
$$
\int_I f=\overline{S}(f).
$$
I have three questions: (1) If $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the uniform function norm over $I$ (i.e. $\|f\|=\sup_{x\in I} f(x)$), then is it true that $(\mathcal{R}(I),\|\cdot\|)$ is complete? (2) Is it equivalent to the above definition when we consider only the uniform subdivisions $\tau_{N}=(x_0,...,x_N)$ with $x_i=a+i\frac{b-a}{N}$? More precisely, is it always true that
$$
\overline{S}(f)=\inf\{\overline{S}_{\tau_N}(f)\ :\ N\in\mathbb{N}\}\\
\underline{S}(f)=\sup\{\underline{S}_{\tau_N}(f)\ :\ N\in\mathbb{N}\}?
$$ (3) For a subdivision $\sigma=(x_0,...,x_N)$ of $I$ we define $\Delta(\sigma)=\max_{i=1}^{N}x_i-x_{i-1}$. Is it true that for a Riemann integrable function $f$ and a sequence of subdivisions $\{\sigma_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty}\Delta(\sigma_n)=0$ we have
$$
\int_I f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\overline{S}_{\sigma_n}(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\underline{S}_{\sigma_n}(f)?
$$
This is true if $f$ is continuous (note that $C^0(I)\subset\mathcal{R}(I)$), however I fail to see if it is true for non-continuous functions. How to prove the answers to the three questions?

  A <_c \mathcal{P}(A),

  i.e., $A \leq_c \mathcal{P}(A)$ but $A \neq_c \mathcal{P}(A)$;
  in fact there is no surjection $\pi \colon A \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)$. Proof. That  $A \leq_c \mathcal{P}(A)$ follows from the fact that the function
  $$
  (x \mapsto \{x\})
$$
  which associates with each member $x$ of $A$ its singleton $\{x\}$ is an injection.
  (Careful here: the singleton $\{x\}$ is a set with just the one member $x$ and it is not the same object as $x$, which is probably not a set to begin with!) To complete the proof, we assume (towards a contradiction) that there exists a surjection
  $$
  \pi \colon A \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{P}(A),

  B = \{ x \in A \mid x \notin \pi(x) \},

I understood the proof, but I don't understand why this choice of $B$ proves that there is no surjection.

I have computed the first five terms by brute force, and examples of each are given below. For $n \geq 6$ , Alec Jones has conjectured that $A275815(n) = 8(n-2)^2$ , which is achieved by placing $4n - 4$ queens around the border of the board—but this has not been proven. Alec's heuristic is based on summing the number of queens that can move to each empty square (which is no more than 8) instead of summing the number of moves each individual queen can make. Any thoughts on how to begin to prove this conjecture? Examples: A $2\times 2$ chess board can ""host"" 4 queen moves: $a1 \to b1$ $a1 \to b2$ $a2 \to b1$ $a2 \to b2$ A $3 \times 3$ board can host 17 moves:
(The queen at a3 has three moves, the queen at a2 has four moves, and the queens at b1 and c3 each have five moves.) A $4 \times 4$ board can host 40 moves: And a $5 \times 5$ board can host 76 moves:","['chessboard', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics', 'oeis', 'sequences-and-series']"
2060617,Question about embeddings in algebraically closed fields,"I was looking at the two following well known propositions: $1$) Let $E|F$ be a finite separable extension of degree n, and let $\sigma$ be an embedding of $F$ in $C$, where $C$ is an algebraic closure of $E$. Then $\sigma$ extends to exactly $n$ embeddings of $E$ in $C$; $2$) The extension $E|F$ is normal if and only if every $F$-monomorphism of $E$ into an algebraic closure $C$ is actually an $F$-automorphism of $E$. Observing the proofs, it seems to me that actually instead of $C$ we can pick any algebraically closed field $L$ containing $F$ (we don't need to assume that it contains also $E$ in these propositions, right?)  $\textbf{in both propositions}$. Is it correct? (I'm not so sure for prop 2)). What I'm thinking of, is the typical situation in number theory where you have $\mathbb C$ instead of $C$. In general $\mathbb C$ is not the algebraic closure of $E$, but just an algebraically closed field. So why in many texts the authors put algebraic closure instead of simply algebraically closed field?","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'extension-field', 'field-theory']"
2060623,Phase plane for guerrilla vs. conventional warfare [closed],"Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 7 years ago . Improve this question For a class, I'm modeling a battle between a conventional force, $C(t)$, and a guerrilla force, $G(t)$. I already know that the time derivative of $C(t)=-gG$, where $g$ is the effectiveness of the guerrilla army, and the time derivative of $G(t)=-cCG$. Then I take the ratio to get $dC/dG = g/cC$. Separating these and integrating, I have $gG = 0.5cC^2 +K$. I'm not sure what $K$ is supposed to be, but I include it since I integrated. Now I must plot the phase plane, and I'm quite lost on how to do this. Does it have to do with plotting the slope field of $dC/dG=1/C$? I also must derive a condition that will tell who wins and loses.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'mathematical-modeling']"
2060626,Trouble understanding conditional probability question,"This is a solved example in Introduction to  Probability by Tsitsiklis, page 26, example 1.11
A Class consists of 4 graduate and 12 undergraduate students is randomly divided into 4 groups of 4. What is the probability that each includes a graduate student? I understand the combinatorial way to do this problem using multinomial theorem. I am here interested in the conditional probability approach. Solution: Let us denote the four graduate students by 1,2,3,4 and consider the events $A_1$ ={students 1 and 2 are in different groups}
$A_2$ = {students 1,2 and 3 are in different groups}
$A_3$ ={students 1,2,3 and 4 are in different groups}
We will calculate $P(A_3) = P(A_1 \cap A_2\cap A_3)= P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)P(A_3|A_1\cap A_2)$
We have $P(A_1) =\frac{12}{15}$
since there are 12 students slot in groups other than the one of the student 1, and there are 15 student slots overall, excluding student 1. Similarly $P(A_2|A_1) =\frac{8}{14}$ and $P(A_3|A_1\cap A_2) =\frac{4}{13}$ and so $P(A_3) = \frac{12}{15} \times \frac{8}{14} \times \frac{4}{13}$ The question I have is how did he get $P(A_1)=\frac{12}{15}$ ?
I understand that there are 4 graduate students who need to be in 4 different groups and along with 3 undergraduate students. I understand the reason for finding $P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3)$.  What I don't understand is how he got $P(A_1) = \frac{12}{15}$. Do we have two groups of 4 students each with two graduate students in two different groups ? Can someone explain to me the size of the two groups we have so formed with $A_1$ and similarly with $A_2$ and $A_3$? If i have calculate $P(A_1),P(A_2|A_1),P(A_3|A_1\cap A_2)$ probabilities using counting how will i come to these numbers ? Thank you.",['probability']

2060802,Expected value of rolling a $5$ followed by a $6$ different than rolling two consecutive sixes?,"I'm aware that the $E[X_n]$ where $X$ is the average number rolls needed to roll $n$ consecutive sixes solves to $E[X_2]=42$ when $n=2$... but why does this differ from rolling other numbers (which are distinct from eachother) such as $5$ and then $6$? For example, if I wanted $X_n$ to be the average number of rolls for getting two consecutive numbers in general, which need not be the same number. If I begin at $0$ rolls and roll a die $2$ times, the probability of getting $2$ sixes on the first two rolls is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$ and the probability of rolling a $5$ and then a $6$ is the same probability. Intuitively, this led me to believe I could extrapolate the result mentioned above regarding $n$ consecutive sixes and apply it to rolling $n$ consecutive numbers (which need not be the same). But the problem I solved did not have the answer as $42$, the answer for the expected value to roll a $5$ followed immediately by a $6$ was $36$.","['expectation', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

If the functions $f, g : G \rightarrow G$, with  $f(x) = x^{2n}$ and $g(x) = x^{3n}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}^*$) are surjective homomorphisms, then prove that $G$ is abelian. Here is what I did so far: Since $f$ and $g$ are homomorphisms, we know that:
$$f(xy) = f(x)f(y), \, \forall \, x, y \in G$$
$$g(xy) = g(x)g(y), \, \forall \, x, y \in G$$ Using the above results, we get $(xy)^{3n} = (xy)^n(xy)^{2n} = (xy)^nx^{2n}y^{2n}$ and $(xy)^{3n} = (xy)^{2n}(xy)^n = x^{2n}y^{2n}(xy)^n$. But $(xy)^{3n} = x^{3n}y^{3n}$. Using these three results, we can easily get: $$(xy)^nx^{2n} = x^{3n}y^n$$
$$y^{2n}(xy)^n = x^ny^{3n}$$ From the first conditions, we have $y^{2n} = x^{-2n}(xy)^{2n}$ and $x^{2n} = (xy)^{2n}y^{-2n}$. $$(xy)^nx^{2n} = x^{3n}y^n = x^{2n}x^ny^n = (xy)^{2n}y^{-2n}x^ny^n$$
$$y^{2n}(xy)^n = x^ny^{3n} = x^ny^ny^{2n} = x^ny^nx^{-2n}(xy)^{2n}$$ By making simplifications, we get:
$$x^{2n} = (xy)^ny^{-2n}x^ny^n$$
$$y^{2n} = x^ny^nx^{-2n}(xy)^n$$ Using these into the first conditions, we have:
$$(xy)^{2n} = (xy)^ny^{-2n}x^ny^nx^ny^nx^{-2n}(xy)^n$$ Again, by making simplifications, we get:
$$y^{2n}x^{2n} = x^ny^nx^ny^n$$ That's all I could find so far. Thank you in advance!","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-homomorphism']"
