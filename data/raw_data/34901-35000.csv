332941,finding $\frac{dz}{dk}$ with differentiation,"Given 
$$
\begin{align*}
y=f(a,b)\\ a=a(u,v) &&b=b(u,v)\\
u=u(r)&&v=v(r)
\end{align*}
$$
Find $\frac{dy}{dr}$? I did it with this method so could somebody assist to confirm the answer? I have decided to find $\frac{da}{dr}$ and $\frac{db}{dr}$ so $$
\begin{align*}
\frac{da}{dr} &= \frac{\partial a}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr} + \frac{\partial a}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}\\\frac{db}{dr} &= \frac{\partial b}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}
\end{align*}
$$
Hence
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dr} &= \frac{\partial y}{\partial a}\frac{da}{dr}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial b}\frac{db}{dr}\\
&=\frac{\partial y}{\partial a}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial a}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr}+ \frac{\partial a}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}\end{pmatrix}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial b}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial b}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}\end{pmatrix}\\&=
\frac{\partial y}{\partial a}\frac{\partial a}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial a}\frac{\partial a}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial b}\frac{\partial b}{\partial u}\frac{du}{dr} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial b}\frac{\partial b}{\partial v}\frac{dv}{dr}

332957,Quotient space definition,"I am trying to solve a homework problem where a quotient space is defined in a way that I do not understand, so I will ask a more simplified question. I understand that $$ [0,1]/0  \sim  1, $$ means that you sew the points 0 and 1 together, getting a circle. The equivalence classes are all singletons except for the one that contains 0 and 1. There is also the common example where a ball is converted into a sphere by sewing the boundary of the ball together. But what does the quotient space defined by $$ [-1, 1]/[0,1/2]$$ look like? The notation is telling me that all points $[0,1/2]$ are identified to a single point, but I still don't understand what this operation means exactly.

332962,Density of $\frac{1}{X^2}$,"I have to answer the following question: If $X$ is a standard Gaussian random variable, what is the density of $\displaystyle \frac{1}{X^2}$? Wikipedia states: ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function#Dependent_variables_and_change_of_variables ) If the probability density function of a random variable $X$ is given as $f_{X}(x)$, it is possible to calculate the probability density function of some variable $g(X)$. If the function $g$ is monotonic, then the resulting density function is: $\displaystyle f_{g(x)}(y)=\left|\frac{d}{dy}\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)\right|\cdot f_{X}\left(g^{-1}(y)\right)$ However $\displaystyle \frac{1}{x^2}$ is not monotonic over the whole line, so can I use this formula in this case, and call $\displaystyle g^{-1}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$,   in which case the answer would be: $$\displaystyle f_{g(x)}(t)=\left|\left(\frac{d}{dt}\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)\right|\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)^2}=     \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2t}}}{2t^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{2\pi}}$$ Using Berci's method, \begin{align} 
\begin{split}
F_Y(t)     &=P(Y<t)\\
&=P\left(\frac1{X^2} <t \right)\\
&=P\left(|X|>\frac1{\sqrt t}\right)\\
&=2\cdot P\left(X<-\frac1{\sqrt t}\right)\\
&=2\cdot F\left(-\frac1{\sqrt t}\right)\\
&=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{-1/\sqrt{t}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}t^2}dt
\end{split}					
\end{align} where the symmetry of the standard Gaussian distribution is used: $\displaystyle P\left(X<-\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)=P\left(X>{1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)$. And now, differentiate with respect to $t$: $$\displaystyle f_{g(x)}(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{-1/\sqrt{t}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}t^2}dt=\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2t}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}t^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ Note that $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2t}}}{2t^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{2\pi}}=1$, as it should be, but $\displaystyle  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2t}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}t^{\frac{3}{2}}}=2$, so this is not the correct answer.

332972,Working with Equivalence Classes and Quotient Sets,"I have a doubt about working with equivalence classes and quotient sets. The definition that I know, is that given an equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $A$, the set of all elements of $A$ equivalent to a certain element $x$ is the set $\left[x\right]\subset A$ which is called the equivalence class of $x$. The set of all equivalence classes is then the set $A/\sim$ called quotient set. Well, I understand this. However I'm a bit confused when working with this, because the set $A/\sim$ is a set of sets right? So if $x \in A/\sim$, $x$ is not an element of $A$ but one entire collection of such elements. However, there're texts that it seems that the author is thinking of $x \in A/\sim$ as just and element of $A$. For instance: in the context of manifolds, when defining tangent vector as equivalence classes of curves, one doesn't think of an element of the tangent space as a set of curves. Or on the context of multilinear algebra, we define the tensor product of vector spaces using one quotient, but we don't think of the elements as sets of vectors. I've heard that ""we think of an element $x \in A/\sim$ as an element subjected to the relation $\sim$"", however, we are thinking of $x$ related to what element of $A$ ? I really didn't get the way that we should work/think about equivalence classes and quotient sets.

332996,Is this correct and if so can we find a nicer way to solve $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n}$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : If $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f(n+1) - f(n) = L$, prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f(n)/n = L$ (4 answers) Closed 5 years ago . The question: Suppose that $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$. If $$\lim_{n \to \infty}[f(n+1)-f(n)] =L$$ prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n}$ exist and equals $L$. My answer: Define $g(n):= f(n+1)-f(n)$ then $g(n-1)=f(n)-f(n-1)$ and so $f(n) = g(n-1)+f(n-1)$. We can recursively apply this to get $f(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-2)+ \cdots +g(0) +f(0)$. Then for $k \ge N_0$ we can  make $|g(k) - L| < \epsilon_0$ which gives $L-\epsilon_0 <g(k)<L+ \epsilon_0$. Also note that $f(N_0) = f(0) + g(0) + \cdots + g(N_0 -1)$ is just some number say $d \in \mathbb{R}$. Now $f(N_0 + n) = d + g(N_0) + g(N_0 +1) + \cdots + g(N_0+n-1)$ and so using the above bound for $g(k)$ with $k \ge N_0$ we can bound $f(N_0+n)$ as follows:$$d+n(L-\epsilon_0) < f(N_0+n)<d+n(L+\epsilon_0)$$
$$\frac{d}{n} +L-\epsilon_0 < \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}<\frac{d}{n} +L+\epsilon_0$$
$$\frac{d}{n} -\epsilon_0 < \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}-L<\frac{d}{n}+\epsilon_0$$ We can take $n$ large enough so that $|\frac{d}{n}| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Also take $\epsilon_0 = \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and we have shown that the limit of $\frac{f(N_0+n)}{n} = L$. If we define $h(n) = \frac{f(N_0+n)}{n}$ then $h(x_n)$ will go to $L$ for every $x_n$ that goes to infinity as $n$ does. So take $x_n = n-N_0$ and we have $\lim_{n \to \infty}h(n-N_0) =L= \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f(n)}{n-N_0}$ dividing top and bottom by $n$ we see that: $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{f(n)}{n}}{1-\frac{N_0}{n}}=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{n} =L$$ I feel like I have missed something because this question is a lot more involved than all of the others I have done so far in the book. Is this correct? Is there a nicer way to do this? Or have I just wasted two days and rambled nonsense ;-)","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

Now here are the facts which I do not really understand how to obtain: A typical element of $C(\mathbb{R_+},\mathbb{R})$ writes $w=\{w(t):t\geq0\}$.

The class $P$ of cylindrical sets is a $\pi$-system, i.e. $C(\mathbb{R_+},\mathbb{R}) \in P$ and $P$ is closed with respect to finite intersections. 
(I have never seen before the definition of a $\pi$-system, I looked it up, but I do not understand why we require here that $C(\mathbb{R_+},\mathbb{R}) \in P$) So I hope there is anybody who can clear things up for me, I would be very glad, any help is welcome!

( boundedness?)","I need to ""study the limit behavior of the following sequence"" and then compute the limit. I can compute the limit and prove the monotonicity, but I am having trouble proving boundedness. I tried to understand from other similar posts how this could be done, but since I didn't understand I'm asking it as a new question.
The sequence is $x_{n+1}=\sqrt{\alpha +x_n}, x_0=\sqrt \alpha, \alpha>0$. It seems to be monotonically increasing. Proof: It can be shown by induction that the sequence is monotonically increasing. Claim that $x_{n+1}\geq x_n$ 
$$x_1=\sqrt{\alpha+\sqrt\alpha}>\sqrt\alpha=x_0$$
$x_{n+1}\implies x_{n+2}$
$$x_{n+1}=\sqrt{\alpha+x_n}<\sqrt{\alpha+x_{n+1}}=\sqrt{\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha+\sqrt\alpha}}=x_{n+2}$$
Boundedness: Because the sequence is monotonically increasing and $x_o=\sqrt\alpha$, it is bounded below by $\sqrt\alpha$. Now comes the part where I have to prove that the sequence is bounded above. The problem is that I don't know how to start, so if anyone could give me a bit of a push I'd be grateful. The limit: I know that $\lim\ x_n=\lim \ x_{n+1}$, so letting $\lim\ x_n=x$ then
$$x=\sqrt{\alpha+x}$$ and solving would give $x=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+4\alpha}}{2}$. May somebody please confirm my proof thus far, and help me prove the upper bound?

  $$div(f)=\sum_{p}Ord_p(f) p$$
  Any divisor of this form is called a principal divisor on $X$. Using the following Lemma, I tried a naive approach: Lemma 1.4. Let $f$ and $g$ be nonzero meromorphic functions on $X.$ Then we have: div($fg$)=div($f$)+div($g$). div($f/g$)=div($f$)-div($g$). div($1/f$)=div(1)-div($f$). Observe that div($y^2$)=div($x(x^4-1)$)=div(x)+div($x^4-1$). So, div($x$)=div($y^2$)-div($x^4-1$). Then I am not sure about div($y^2$) and div($x^4-1$). I think they are both zero. Also, I have the following at disposal: Lemma 3.12. Let $\omega$ be a meromorphic 1-form defined in a neighborhood of 
  $p\in X.$ Let $\gamma$ be a small path on $X$ enclosing $p$ and not enclosing any other pole 
  of $\omega.$ Then Res$_p$($\omega$)=$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\omega.$

  Res$_p$($df/f$) = ord$_p$($f$). Then $Ord_p(y^2)=Res_p(\frac{2}{y})=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{2}{y}.$ But how to solve this integral? Any suggestions/hints? Thanks.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

Motivation is taken from this question : existence of $\{B_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ implies that $\mu(\lim_n B_n) = m$, and thus the image of $\mu$ is closed in $\Bbb R$. Using the fact that any sequence of reals contains a monotone subsequence (non-increasing, or non-decreasing, or both), we can assume that $\{\mu(A_n)\}_{n\geq 0}$ is a monotone sequence.

Why is it true that $M$ is not isomorphic to $N \oplus M/N$? Thoughts I've had so far: I found out that $M$ is not a free or even projective $\mathbb{Z}$-module (note: projective modules are free over PIDs, as a commenter pointed out), but that fact doesn't preclude the possibility that the sequence $0 \to K \to M \to K \oplus M/K \to 0$ can still split some of the time for some $\mathbb{Z}$-submodule $K \subseteq M$. So the result does not follow directly from $M$ not being projective. I don't know much about $M/N$ besides that it consists of infinite sequences of integers, with sequences that only differ by a finite number of entries being identified. If $M/N$ is free or projective then the result follows from the fact that $M$ is not projective, but I don't have any intuition as to the freeness or projectiveness of $M/N$. I tried a proof considering $M$ as a ring with multiplication defined component-wise, and then consider $M$,$N$,$M/N$ as $M$-modules.

\begin{equation}
\rho(X,Y)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{20} (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{(\sum_{i=1}^{20}(x_i-\bar{x})^{2})(\sum_{i=1}^{20}(y_i-\bar{y})^{2})}}

If $0.7\leq\rho(X,Y)<1$ then $X$ and $Y$ has a strong linear correlation, if $0.5\leq\rho(X,Y)<0.7$ then $X$ and $Y$ has a modest linear correlation, and if $0\leq\rho(X,Y)<0.5$ then $X$ and $Y$ has a weak linear correlation.
 Using this formula, we get $\rho(X,Y)=0.9$ and $\rho(X,Z)=0.5$. However, the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is actually quadratic but they have the high correlation coefficient that indicate linear correlation. So, my question is what is ""linear correlation"" actually between $X$ and $Y$ ? Since $\rho(X,Z)=0.5$ indicate the modest correlation coefficient, what is another intepretation of this value?

333320,Characterizing singularities using sheaves of smooth functions,"Short version: Let $H\subset M$ be a closed subset of a smooth manifold. Equip $H$ with the sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of smooth functions (so that a section over an open $U$ is the restriction to $U$ of a smooth function on some open of $M$). If $p\in H$ has a neighbourhood $U$ in $H$ such that $(U,\mathcal{F}_{\mid U})$ is isomorphic to a euclidean ball with its sheaf of smooth functions, then does $p$ have a neighbourhood $V\subset M$ such that $H\cap V$ is an embedded submanifold of $V$? The whole story I am studying a certain space $H$. This space can be identified with the inverse image of a singleton under a smooth map between smooth manifolds (by smooth, I mean $C^\infty$, although you may replace smooth by real analytic throughout the question if you wish). For the sake of notation, let us say that $f:M\to N$ is the smooth map between smooth manifolds, and that $H=f^{-1}(\{p\})$. Now $H$ need not be a submanifold of $M$ because $p$ could be a singular value of $f$ (and in my case, it typically is). I would therefore like to split $H$ into a smooth and a singular part, and then study the smooth part as a manifold. It seems to me there is a straightforward way to do this: take the smooth part to be all points of $H$ where $f$ is submersive, and call all other points singular. Then the smooth part is an open subset of $H$ and a submanifold of $M$. Nice. However, this approach has the disadvantage of using the map $f$ and not just the set $H$. Suppose for example that
$$f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}:(x,y)\mapsto x^2 ,$$
then $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ is a line, but all its points are considered singular. We could construct the same line as $g^{-1}(\{0\})$ for the map $g(x,y)=x$, and then all points are smooth. This shows why splitting $H$ using submersivity of $f$ may be a bad idea. My problem may thus be stated as: how can we distinguish between singular and smooth points of $H$ ? First proposal. One solution would be to call a point of $H$ smooth iff it has some neighbourhood $U$ in $M$ such that $H\cap U$ is a submanifold of $U$. This seems very close to geometrical intuition. I should make an important remark, however. Although $H$ was identified with a level set of $f$, there are many other maps $f':M'\to N'$ and points $p'\in N'$ such that $H$ can also be identified with the level set $(f')^{-1}(\{p'\})$. If the splitting of $H$ is to make sense, then I want the singularities of $H$ seen as a subset of $M$ to be the same as the singularities of $H$ seen as a subset of $M'$. I know that there are smooth maps $\alpha:M\to M'$ and $\beta:M'\to M$ both of which restrict to the ""identity"" on $H$.
It is not clear to me that the first proposal will result in the same splitting if we use $f'$ instead of $f$. This leads me to my second proposal. Second proposal. For every open of $H$ we could look at all functions on it that are restrictions of smooth functions on some open of $M$. I believe this defines a sheaf on $H$, though I'm new to sheaves. We can then define a point to be smooth if it has some neighbourhood such that this neighbourhood equipped with the restriction of the sheaf is isomorphic to an open euclidean ball with its sheaf of smooth functions. This has the advantage that it does not depend on whether we use $f$ or $f'$ because $H$ will be equipped with the same sheaf in both cases (thanks to the maps $\alpha$ and $\beta$). It is also clear that points that are smooth according to the first proposal are also smooth according to the second. However, this proposal is not nearly as attractive to me as the first one in terms of geometrical intuition. Maybe some points that are labeled as smooth by this proposal are not supposed to be. This approach is also mentioned briefly in Thomas Klimpel's answer to Smooth structure on the topological space . What geometrical intuition can motivate the second proposal? In particular, is every point that is smooth according to the second proposal also smooth according to the first one?","['sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

333519,Pointers about the concept of 'division extensionality'?,"When working a bit on another question ( If $a \equiv b\pmod m$, then $\gcd(a, m) = \gcd(b, m)$ ), I discovered the following, which seems to be valid:
$$
a = b \;\;\equiv\;\; \langle \forall d :: d \mid a \;\equiv\; d \mid b \rangle
$$
(Note that all variables denote natural numbers.) I have not seen this concept before, and tentatively call it division extensionality : two natural numbers are the same iff they have the same divisors.  I did not succeed in proving this.  How should I go about that proof (or is the above just not true)?  And what is the usual name for this concept? Also, very likely there is some more general concept of extensionality, which also covers set extensionality.  Any pointers? Finally, I found that (if the above is true) also the following holds:
$$
a = b \pmod m \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \langle \forall d : d \mid m : d \mid a \;\equiv\; d \mid b \rangle

The arithmetic genus is constant in a flat family, so $X_t$ has arithmetic genus zero: that is, the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf is equal to one. Moreover, since $X$ is normal of dimension two, it is Cohen-Macaulay, and each fiber is therefore Cohen-Macaulay as well.

I'm deriving expressions from scratch, and got stuck at this step. Does this series seem familiar to you in any way? Is there a  way to lose the limit and summation expressions? I'd appreciate small hints. Some background: water resources It is based on the method of constructing arbitrary hydrographs from unit hyetographs in water resources. Basically, you have a function $i(t)$ that defines the amount of rainfall over a basin, and $u(t)$ that defines the water discharge through an exit point. Note that both are functions of time. $u(t)$ is also a functional of $i(t)$. A unit hyetograph is a function of $t$ defined through:
$$i_u(t) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    0 & \quad t<0 \ \ {\rm or}\ \ t>\Delta t\\
    1 & \quad t>0\ \  {\rm and}\ \ t<\Delta t 
  \end{array} \right.
$$ The corresponding hydrograph is obtained empirically. Just suppose that there is a function $u_u(t)$ that corresponds to this unit hyetograph. Note that the only characteristic of $i_u(t)$ is $\Delta t$. Now that we have defined a unit hyetograph $i_u(t)$, we want to construct $u(t)$ from arbitrary $i(t)$ by superposition, which explains why $u(t)$ is defined as a functional of $i(t)$ and $u_u(t)$. Below is a visual example (Implemented in MATLAB): After Vincent Tjeng's answer, I've considered taking the convolution of both functions. I've used the conv function from MATLAB. The result can be seen in the following figure. I've taken $\Delta t=0.25$ to demonstrate how the series expression converges to the convolution: EDIT: Non-calculus example on the subject: The unit hyetograph and the corresponding unit hydrograph are given. An arbitrary hyetograph is given. To determine the corresponding hydrograph, the unit hydrograph is multiplied by 2, offset by $t_r$. This is equal to $u(t)=u_u(t)+2\ u_u(t-t_r)$. The series above is obtained in a similar way. The two steps are summed together. The resulting hydrograph. Some remarks: This example (which follows the convention used by all engineers), is defined over a discrete timestep $\Delta t = t_r$. However, I now realize that while I am trying to obtain a general mathematical solution, I am ending up with a system where the $t_r$ is differential. Furthermore, I now realize that the expression I derived above assumues $i_u$, the unit hydrograph to be equal to the Dirac Delta function, which is not the case in practice. Nevertheless, I find the following paragraph in Wikipedia: An instantaneous unit hydrograph is a further refinement of the
  concept; for an IUH, the input rainfall is assumed to all take place
  at a discrete point in time (obviously, this isn't the case for actual
  rainstorms). Making this assumption can greatly simplify the analysis
  involved in constructing a unit hydrograph, and it is necessary for
  the creation of a geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph . It seems that I have successfully reinvented the wheel.",['sequences-and-series']

As $|G_1|$ and $|G_2|$ are coprime we must have that $|H_1| \neq |H_2|$ as by Lagrange's theorem $|H_1| \ \mid \ |G_1|$ and $|H_2| \ \mid \ |G_2|$ Also $|G_1|$ and $|G_2|$ are coprime implies that $|H_1|$ and $|H_2|$ are coprime which, in turn, implies that $| H_1 \times H_2 | = |H_1| \cdot |H_2|$ As $H_1 \times H_2 \leq K$ we must have, by Lagrange's theorem, that $| H_1 \times H_2 | = |H_1| \cdot |H_2| \ \mid \ K$ Also as $K \leq G_1 \times G_2$ and $|G_1 \times G_2| = |G_1| \cdot |G_2|$ then $K \ \mid \ |G_1| \cdot |G_2|$ I can't see the connection to make to conclude that $K = H_1 \times H_2$, I'm pretty sure that if $|K| = |H_1 \times H_2| = |H_1| \cdot |H_2|$ it implies the result, but I can't see how to conclude it. Also, in regards to the second part, showing that the result need not follow if $|G_1|$ and $|G_2|$ are not coprime, this is obvious, but is there a 'simple' counter example or can it be argued in a similar fashion to the above?

333853,Proof of Fermat's little theorem using groups,"I am trying to prove Fermat's little theorem using groups. Here is my proof: Let $p$ be a prime. Since all numbers a such that $1\leq a\leq p-1$ are relatively prime
with $p$, they form a group under multiplication modulo $p$.(There is a theorem about
this, that must be true, they should be forming a group). So, let the group be
$G=\{a,a^2,\dots,a^{p-1}\}$ and binary operation is multiplication modulo $p$. Since all
elements of this group are relatively prime with $p$, then any element $a \in G$ is a 
generator of this group, and this group is cyclic. So, we must have $a \cdot a^{p-1}=a \bmod p$. Then multiplying each sides with $a{-1}$ (which exists since this is a group) we get $a^{p-1}=1 \bmod p$. Is there any mistake in my proof? I appreciate your helps. Thank you","['elementary-number-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"
333859,Prove that direct sum of linear transformations is a block matrix,"In linear algebra, I'm facing a question I cannot quite formalize into a full proof. I want to prove that a direct sum of linear transformations is a block matrix. Here's the formal question: Assume $V$ is a vector space with $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ as subspaces such that $V = U_1\oplus\cdots\oplus U_n$ . Assume that each $T_i: U_i\to U_i$ is a linear transformation. Assume that $T = T_1 \oplus T_2 \oplus\cdots\oplus T_n$ . How do I formally prove that $T$ can be represented as follows? $$\begin{bmatrix}A_1&&&0\\&A_2&&\\&&\dots\\0&&&A_m\end{bmatrix}$$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_m$ are square matrices representing $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ accordingly.

333866,Solving Recursive Equations: How to transform the domain in such cases?,"I understand that a widely-used recursive equation for the Binary Search is as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
T(1) &= 1\\
T(n) &= T(\tfrac{n}{2}) + 1, \quad n>1
\end{align}
$$ In order to solve the recursive equation we would simply transform the domain by setting $n = 2^k$, write the transformed equation, go through the telescoping and all that good stuff... Anyway, my professor said that sometimes there may be an odd number of elements in a sorted list, in which case the equation would look like:
$$
\begin{align}
T(1) &= 1\\
T(n) &= T(\tfrac{n-1}{2}) + 1,\quad n>1
\end{align}
$$ Then I wondered, how would I perform a domain transformation on such an equation? Thank you very much!","['recursive-algorithms', 'discrete-mathematics']"
333877,Do Carmo: Linear Killing field anti-symmetric?,"In Exercise 3.5a of Riemannian Geometry , do Carmo defines a vector field $v$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be linear if it's linear as a map $v\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to\mathbb{R}^n$. He then asks the reader to prove that such a $v$, defined by a matrix $A$, is a Killing field iff $A$ is anti-symmetric. However, I've run into a problem. Suppose $v$ is a linear Killing field with matrix $A$. The flow of $v$ is given by $\phi_t(x)=tAx + x$ and is defined for all $t,x$. Its derivative is $d\phi_t=tA + I$. Then since $\phi_t$ is (by do Carmo's definition) an isometry, for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have
\begin{align}
\langle x, x \rangle
&= \langle d\phi_tx, d\phi_tx \rangle\\
&= \langle tAx + x, tAx + x\rangle\\
&= t^2\langle Ax,Ax\rangle + 2t\langle Ax,x\rangle + \langle x,x\rangle\\
0 &= t^2\langle x,A^\top Ax\rangle + 2t\langle Ax,x\rangle.
\end{align}
But this is true for all $t$, so the coefficients of $t$ and $t^2$ on the rhs must be identically zero. Hence, $\langle Ax,x\rangle=0$ for all $x$, which means $A$ is anti-symmetric, and $\langle x,A^\top Ax\rangle =0$ for all $x$, which means $A^\top A$ is anti-symmetric. But $A^\top A$ is also symmetric, so $A^\top A=0$. Hence, $-A^2 = A^\top A = 0$. Since a general anti-symmetric matrix is not nilpotent (are there any nilpotent nonzero anti-symmetric matrices?), do Carmo's statement is false. What have I missed?",['differential-geometry']
