827382,Directional derivatives exist for function neither continuous nor differentiable at the point they exist,"It's an old past paper with no mark scheme, this always makes me a slightly afraid of exploring unaided. The function is: $f(x,y)=\frac{xy^2}{x^2+y^6}$ if $(x,y)\ne(0,0)$ else $0$. I am to show all the directional derivatives exist at $(0,0)$ Intuitively, $(\nabla f)(0,y)=0=(\nabla f)(x,0)$ because clearly in either case $f$ is constant, at 0. So using some linear algebra, and the linear map that it the derivative ($(Df(a))(v_x,v_y)$ is the derivative function at a in direction $v=(v_x,v_y)$, well as it is a linear map $(Df(a))(v)=(Df(a))(v_x(1,0)+v_y(0,1))=v_x(Df(a))(1,0)+v_y(Df(a))(0,1)$ By using definitions (namely: $[(Df(a))]_{i,j}=(\nabla f_i)_j$) we see $(Df(a))(v)=(\nabla f)(v_x,0)+(\nabla f)(v_y,0)=0$ The question asks for: 1) State the exact definition of differentiability at $(0,0)$ for $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ 2) Show all the directional derivatives of f exist at (0,0) and comput their values. 3) Show that f is not continuous at (0,0) I can (probably) do this - I'd show it isn't sequentially continuous $\implies$ not continuous 4) Show that $f$ is not differentiable at $(0,0)$ using the definition in part 1. (Hint: you can take a small deviation away from the origin param by $h_1=t^3,h_2=t,t\in\mathbb{R},t\ne0$) For part 4 I think I can use: $f$ differentiable $\iff$ $$lim_{h->0}(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)-(Df(a))(h)}
{||h||})=0$$ Then show the limit from $t<0$ and $t>0$ disagree (or something) I am confused because the curve $f(x,y)=xy$ also has derivatives of 0 along each axis, yet for the direction (1,1) the curve is certainly not doing nothing (staying constant), but the properties of a linear map.... I am also confused because $(t^3,t)$ is a direction!","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
827387,Ideal shrinking of discrete randomness source,"I have a discrete randomness source that emits random integer numbers in range [0..N) with uniform distribution. I need to reduce this distribution, limiting it to [0..M) , where M <= N , but keep it both integer and uniform. I can't think of approaches that would work for N % M != 0 . For example, for N = 100 and M = 99 , if projection function is f(x) := x % M , it appears that zero is rolled out twice more often than any other value, because both f(0) = 0 and f(99) = 0 . For f(x) := floor(M * x / N) it's the same — these methods induce aliasing, which is strictly unwanted. Of course, I could try to select such M' for which N >= M' >= M , N % M' == 0 and M' % M == 0 , and just retry getting random value from source each time random value is larger than M' , but I don't like this approach, as it has big chance to just waste randomness. Is there maybe more correct solution to this problem? What I am trying to do is distributed random number generation — I get random bitstring of fixed length L after collecting and processing every response, which can be seen as an integer number in range N=2**L , [0..N) . Application may not need such large numbers, it may desire random number in range [0..M) , so I need to somehow truncate what I have to what I need, and that's what this question is about.","['random-functions', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'random']"

827404,Analysis of “Tiny Dice Dungeon” (I),"Consider the following one-player game:  Initially, there is a pot of $\$0$. On each turn, the player may opt to end the game and collect the contents of the pot, or roll a single die.  In the latter case, if the roll is $1$, the game is over and the player collects nothing.  Otherwise, the amount of the die roll (from $\$2–\$6$) is added to the pot, and the player gets another move.  The player continues rolling until they either get a $1$, and collect nothing, or opt to collect the pot.  We would like to find the optimal strategy for this game, and the expected payoff under the optimal strategy. A simple (but not quite correct) analysis goes like this:  Any rational strategy must take the form “Stop if and only if the pot has value at least $\$S$.”  If the pot contains $\$P$, then the expected gain from the next die roll is $\frac16(-P+2+3+4+5+6 )$ dollars.  This is positive whenever $P\ge 20$, so the player should roll until the pot reaches $\$20$ or more, and then stop and collect it. This is in fact an optimal strategy, but the analysis is not exactly correct,  because it assumes, incorrectly, that the expected gain from a successful die roll is exactly $\$4$.  But actually the expectation is a little bit more than this, because a successful die roll not only adds $\$4$ to the pot, it enables further die rolls that may add more.  In fact strategies $S=20$ and $S=21$ yield identical expected payoffs of $\$8.141794893727$. A more careful analysis follows:  Let $X_S(P)$ be the expected amount won by following the stop-at-$S$ strategy when $\$P$ is already in the pot.  Then $X_S$ satisfies the following unusual recurrence: $$X_S(P) = \begin{cases}
P & \text{if $P\ge S$} \\
\frac16\sum_{i=2}^6 X_S(P+i) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ We are interested in the behavior of $X_S(0)$, which we can calculate exactly using this recurrence.  This is tedious, so I had the computer do it.  $X_S(0)$ is maximized, as already mentioned, for $S=20$ and $S=21$. My questions are: Is there an easier method to calculate $X_S(0)$ without the help of the computer? Is there an argument that shows that $X_{20}(0) = X_{21}(0)$?","['dice', 'probability', 'expectation']"
827448,Zero divisors in ring of real valued functions.,"I'm working though Pinter's A book of Abstract Algebra and would like a quick verification on a simple problem. Exercise 17.B2 asks Describe the divisors of zero in $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$. Note that $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the ring of all real valued functions endowed with pointwise multiplication and addition. My attempt If a non-zero element $f$ is a zero divisor of $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$, then there exists a non-zero $g$ such that $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}: \quad f(x)g(x) = 0.$$ Because $f$ is non-zero, there exists an $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) \neq 0$. I claim that if, in addition, there is an $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) = 0$, then $f$ is a zero-divisor. To see this, define $g$ by $$ g(x) = \begin{cases}
0 &\text{if}\;\;\; x \neq x_2 \\ 
1 &\text{if}\;\;\; x = x_2 \end{cases}$$ Then it is clear that $g$ is non-zero and $fg=0$. Thus, $f$ is a zero-divisor. I claim, further, that such $f$ are the only zero divisors. To see this, suppose that there does not exist an $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) = 0$. Then $f(x) \neq 0$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. But then for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we can divide though by $f(x)$ in  $f(x)g(x) = 0$ to obtain $$g(x) = \frac{0}{f(x)} = 0.$$ Which means that all $g$ that satisfy $fg=0$ must have $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ contradicting the requirement that $g$ is non-zero. I'm trying to learn this on my own, and am having some trouble understanding and gaining intuition regarding zero-divisors. So even though this may seem simple, I would like some help and criticism :)","['self-learning', 'proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

827576,"What is integration by parts, really?","Integration by parts comes up a lot - for instance, it appears in the definition of a weak derivative / distributional derivative, or as a tool that one can use to turn information about higher derivatives of a function into information about an integral of that function. Concrete examples of this latter category include: proving that $f \in C^2(S^1)$ implies that the Fourier series of $f$ converges absolutely and uniformly, and the Taylor series expansion with the integral formula for remainder. However, I don't feel like I really understand what integration by parts is really doing. To me, it is just an algebraic trick that follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus and the product rule. Is there some more conceptual way to think about it? How do you think about this useful idea?","['soft-question', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

827636,Why can't elliptic curves be parameterized with rational functions?,"Background: For our abstract algebra class, we were asked to prove that $\mathbb{Q}(t, \sqrt{t^3 - t})$ is not purely transcendental. It clearly has transcendence degree $1$, so if it is purely transcendental, there is a transcendental $u$ and rational functions $f$ and $g$ such that $f(u) = t$ and $g(u) = \sqrt{t^3 - t}$. Therefore, $f(u)^3 - f(u) = g(u)^2$. But since $u$ is transcendental, $f(x)^3 - f(x) = g(x)^2$ as polynomials. This would be a rational parameterization of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$. Since I'm not very familiar with elliptic curves, I couldn't show directly that such a parameterization cannot exist. So I  showed that it would give rise to an integer solution to $pq(p + q)(p - q) = r^2$. The pathway to get there is really neat, but long, so unless someone asks, I'll omit it. Using a vaguely geometric argument from Fermat, I showed there are no integer solutions. But this was a very 1) lengthy 2) tricky-to-motivate 3) bizarre proof, and it would have been much easier if I could have proved that elliptic curves do not admit a rational parameterization. Internet searches have mentioned all sorts of things about the topology of the curve, and parameterizations in the Weierstrass $\wp$ function, but they seemed to take the fact for granted, because I never saw a proof. Could anyone show me a proof for this statement? Also, $y^2 = x^3 + 0x + 0$ does have a rational parameterization; is this some kind of degenerate case that can be kicked out?","['algebraic-geometry', 'parametric', 'elliptic-curves']"
827638,Determining the nature of isolated singularities,"I am working on some exam practice questions (and do have the answers to these questions) but I am having trouble developing proper 'insight' as to how these answers are derived: (a) $$\frac{\sin z}{z^2}, \frac{\cos z-1}{z^3}$$ In both these cases, we have a pole of order 1 at $z=0$, and in evaluating these, we evaluate the limits:
$$\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{\sin z}{z}, \frac{\cos z-1}{z^2}$$ When I did these questions myself, my first thought was to set: $$g(0)=\lim_{z \to 0}(z^2f(z))=\lim_{z \to 0} \sin z = 0 $$ which obviously would be incorrect. I'm assuming the solution is actually  to do $$g(0)=\lim_{z \to 0}(zf(z))=\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{\sin z}{z} = 1 $$ So my question is this: How do we know to multiply by $z$ rather than $z^2$? Is this just by intuition and knowing that this would 'fix' the function to make it analytic? (b) For the function $$ z^4\sin \left(\frac{1}{z}\right)$$ we have a singularity at $z=0$, my intuition is that this is an essential singularity because there is no way to 'fix' the function to make it analytic, but the solutions suggest writing it as a Laurent expansion, to which it then simply says that it is clear $z=0$ is an essential singularity. Is this because in the Laurent expansion none of the coefficients are $0$? (c) For the function $$ \frac{1+z}{1-z^4}$$ we have singularities at $z=1,-1,i,-i$, If I evaluate the limits (for example) $(z-1)f(z)$ as $z$ approaches 1, then they all give something non-zero, except $z=-1$, then I get simple poles at $z=1,i,-i$ and an essential pole at $z=-1$. But the solutions says that $z=-1$ is a removable pole? Why is this? I would greatly appreciate some help in order to clear up my confusions. Many thanks!","['singularity', 'complex-analysis']"

827663,Finding out properties of this ODE system knowing only partial informations about it.,"I was doing some preparation for my exam, and I found this interesting exercise (text is in italian). Let's consider the planar system \begin{cases} \dot{x} &= P(x,y) \\ \dot{y} &=Q(x,y) \end{cases}
where $P,Q \in C^1(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{R})$. Assume that every circle centered at the origin with integer radius is invariant . Let's denote with $\Lambda^+(x,y)$ the limit set of the point $(x,y)$. I have to answer the following questions: 1) Prove that $\Lambda^+(x,y) \neq \emptyset$ for every $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. it's trivially true. If the point $(x,y)$ lies in one of the circle, it's entire orbit it's contained in it, and by compactness every sequences ($t_n \to \infty$) of points of the orbit admits a convergent subsequence. A similar argument works for the annuli between the circles. I'm confident with this answer 2) Determine for which points the set $\Lambda^+(x,y)$ can be computed explicitly. If the point is the origin, the circumferencewith radius $0$ is invariant, so the point is fixed, so $\Lambda^+(0,0)=(0,0)$. I can't say anything for the other points, because the other cycles can be a connected set composed of a finite number of fixed points together with homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits connecting the points. According to me, I can't say anything else 3) Give sufficient conditions s.t. the system doesn't have limit cycles. If the the system is Hamiltonian, then it can't have any limit cycles. If the system is a gradient system, I can't have any periodic orbit,in particular any limit cycle. if the system satisfy the hypothesis of the Bendixson-Dulac theorem then it can't have any periodic solution. I don't know any other condition and then I added (as a challenge:) ) this question 4) Study the properties of the orbits in the annuli. It's permitted to ad some hypothesis on the system. If the only critical points lies in the cycles, and the system is Hamiltonian, then using the Poincaré-Bendixson thm I can conclude that every point belongs to a periodic solution. I don't know how to deal with the case that fixed point could exists in the annuli So my questions are: Are my thoughts right? Is there a way to deal with fixed point inside the annuli? (I doubt that there can be fixed points, because of the Continue dependence from initial value. (I can't formalize very well this fact) A few words about this last question: if we consider the system (non hamiltonian) in polar coordinates \begin{cases} \dot{r} &= r \sin(r) \\ \dot{\theta} &= -\cos( r)  \end{cases} it has a phase portrait of this kind (modulo a reparametrization to have integer radii) In which the orbits don't have any cycles inside the annuli. So if I relax the hypothesis on being Hamiltonian, it is not true that I have cycles inside the annuli. Anyway I can't find an example with fixed point inside.

Define $f(x)=lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n(x)$. This is well defined as $f_n(x)$ is a cauchy sequence for all x. For fixed m > N and a given $\epsilon>0$, $\forall n>N, |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|<\epsilon$.

Consider a curve $\beta:(a,b)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by arc length with curvature $\kappa >0$ and torsion $\tau > 0$. We know that $|\beta'| = 1$ and $\beta'' = \kappa\cdot n$, where $n$ is the normal vector. From the Frenét equations we have $b' = \tau\cdot n$, where $b$ is the binormal vector. Note that we can write $n = \frac{1}{\tau}b'$, with this we have that $\beta'' = \frac{\kappa}{\tau}b'$ and $\beta' = n\times b = \frac{1}{\tau}b'\times b $. Now we can do the following calculations $$\kappa = \frac{|\beta'\times\beta''|}{|\beta'|^3} = |\beta'\times\beta''| = \left| \left(\frac{1}{\tau}b'\times b\right)\times\left(\frac{\kappa}{\tau}b'\right)\right| = $$

$$= \frac{\kappa}{\tau^2}\left||b'|\cdot b\right|= \frac{\kappa}{\tau^2}|b'|\cdot |b| = \frac{\kappa}{\tau^2}|b'|$$ Therefore, $$\kappa = \frac{\kappa}{\tau^2}|b'| \implies \tau = \sqrt{|b'|} $$ Thanks.",['differential-geometry']

828117,Basic Analysis Help. Open & Closed Sets; Topology,"I need some help! First, let me say that I am Mathematics major, as I'm a senior in college finishing up my undergraduate work with the hope of going to graduate school for Mathematics in the future; moreover, I'm independently studying the last few chapters in a Basic Analysis textbook offered by the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania over the summer (summer of 2014).  I was going to wait for the upcoming Fall-2014/2015 semester, and ask a professor for help, but I figured why not give the Math Stack Exchange a try in the meantime. Here's the question (exactly): $\underline{Proposition}$:  $~~$Let $X$ be a set and $d,$ $d'$ be two metrics on $X$.  Suppose that there exists an $\alpha > 0,$ and $\beta > 0$ $~$such that $\alpha d(x,y) \leq d'(x,y) \leq \beta d(x,y)$ for all $x,y\in X$.  $~~$Show that $U$ is open in $(X,d)$ if, and only if $U$ is open in $(X,d')$. $~~$That is, the topologies of $(X,d)$ and $(X,d')$ are the same. Here's what I've done so far: I've tried both directions of the bi-conditional statement, and I figured the trivial part is using the formula that there is an $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$ $~$such that for all for all $x,y\in X$ yields $\alpha d(x,y) \leq d'(x,y) \leq \beta d(x,y)$. For the $\Rightarrow$ direction, suppose $U$ is open in $(X,d)$. So, for all $x\in U$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that $B(x,\delta):=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\delta\}\subset U$. From here, I try defining a $\delta_{_{0}}:=\dfrac{\delta}{\beta}>0$, and take $u\in B(x,\delta_{_{0}})$.  This implies that: $d'(x,u)\leq\beta d(x,u)<\beta\delta_{_{0}} = \beta\bigg(\dfrac{\delta}{\beta}\bigg) = \delta$; that is, $d'(x,u)<\delta$, and hence $B(x,\delta_{_{0}})\subset B(x,\delta)\subset U$ since $u\in B(x,\delta)$ whenever $u\in B(x,\delta_{_{0}})$. Therefore, $U$ is open in $(X,d')$. For the $\Leftarrow$ direction, I start to get lost, as I try to do the same thing as above, but, this time, I'll use the fact that $\alpha d(x,y)\leq d'(x,y)$; moreover, I figured to define say a $\delta_{_{1}}:= \alpha\cdot\delta$, and using a similar reasoning as above to show that $U$ is open in $(X,d)$, after assuming $U$ is open in $(X,d')$ of course. What I need assistance on is whether, or not, my proof is correct, if I'm on the right track, if I'm totally incorrect, etc.  My main issue is that $B(x,\delta_{_{0}})\subset B(x,\delta)\subset U$ part for the $\Rightarrow$ implication, for instance.  I'm thinking that I would have to use a minimum between $\delta_{_{0}}$ and $\delta$ in order to ensure the open ball $B(x,\delta_{_{0}})\subset B(x,\delta)$.  I say this because when $\beta\geq1$ the previous inclusion is trivial as $\delta_{_{0}}\leq\delta$, but when $0<\beta<1$, this is where I'm thinking the minimum is needed as I can see that 
$B(x,\delta_{_{0}})\supset B(x,\delta)$ in this case in particular.  Sorry that I made this a bit long, but I figured the more I can get across, the better; also, I've been manipulating the given formula relating $d$ and $d'$ many different ways, and I keep ending up with this same problem:  Simply put, I can't manage to make a smaller open ball within the existential open ball that can be defined with respect to the given assumption when proving one of the two implications from the proposition above.  Any insight, help, hints, different approaches, etc. would be GREATLY appreciated!  PLEASE HELP! Regarding the Answer Thanks for the help Hayden, for some reason the link won't let me add a comment, but I reworked the problem with your proof and my proof together, and I see what you mean.

It has to represent something otherwise we won't be using it. And the fact that this fraction can be nicely used to derive the product rule for example doesn't comes for free. So my question is clear, what does $\frac{dv}{d\mu}$ represent. The notion of derivative hasn't been introduced (yet) in the book so I am not supposed to conclude that if I derive v w.r to $\mu$ I get f.

828508,Why can a discontinuous function not be differentiable?,"I don't really understand why a discontinuous function cannot be differentiable. In Stewart's Calculus , the definition of a function $f$ being differentiable at $a$ is that $f'(a)$ exists. Earlier it gives the definition of the derivative as $f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$. It also has a theorem that if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$. There is also a definition that a functions $f$ is continuous at a number $a$ if $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$. Take for example the very simple function: $$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
x+1 & x\geq0, \\
x & x<0. 
\end{cases}
$$ It is discontinuous at $x=0$ (the limit $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)$ does not exist and so does not equal $f(0)$), but if I find the derivative using the limit above, I get the left and right limits to equal $1$. So therefore, the derivative exists. According to the book, the function shouldn't be differentiable at $x=0$ as it has a discontinuity (continuity is a necessary condition of differentiability).

The order of $a$ is $p$ since $\phi(a) = a= a^pa\rightarrow a^p=e$ therefore the $order(\phi)|p$ If $order(\phi) = 1$ then for all $ x\in G$ $\phi(x) = x=x^{p+1}\rightarrow x^p=e$ . Thus every element has order $p$ therefore $G$ is a $p-group$ For $order(\phi) = p$ I get stuck: $\phi^p(x) = x = x^{(p+1)^p}$ using the expansion formula and simplifying i reach that the order of each element in $G$ divides $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{p}{k}p^k=(p+1)^p-1$.

Let $|G| = kp^n$ where $k$ is not a multiple of $p$  ($p\nmid k$). If $k>1$ then take a $q$ in $k$'s prime factorization.

I cannot reach a contradiction :'( Question #2: Show each element of $G$ has order $p$ When $order(\phi) = 1$ i get what I want but I'm also stuck when $order(\phi) =p$ I believe $a\in Z(G)$, is there a way I can show this?

And used the Cauchy-Riemann equations for polar co-ordinates to show the following (I skipped out a lot of working, but I'm quite confident that I'm correct with it); $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{r} \cdot \frac{\partial v}{\partial \theta} \Rightarrow \frac{-\cos(\theta)}{r^2} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{r^2} \Rightarrow 0 = 2 \cdot\cos(\theta) \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$$ $$\frac{\partial v}{\partial r} = \frac{-1}{r} \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} \Rightarrow \frac{-\sin(\theta)}{r^2} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{r^2} \Rightarrow 0 = 2 \cdot\sin(\theta) \Rightarrow \theta = n\pi$$ (In both cases, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$) Hence, for these equations to be satisfied, we must have $n\pi = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi$, which has no solutions, so $f(z)$ is nowhere differentiable.

""When we place $n$ distinct points on the $xy$-plane, prove that there exists a rectangle, whose diagonal is closed by two of the $n$ points and whose edges are parallel to either $x$-axis or $y$-axis, has at least $\lfloor(n+1)/5\rfloor+1$ points inside or on the edges."" As a result, the question seems very difficult to me. Can anyone help? Update : I crossposted to MO .","['geometry', 'circles']"

$$\forall^\star x\, \forall^\star y\,P(x,y) \Leftrightarrow \forall^\star y\, \forall^\star x\,P(x,y)$$ where $x,y$ are taken from (distinct) measure spaces, $P$ is a measurable predicate, and the $\forall^\star$ quantifier is ""almost all""? I am ok with assuming that both measure spaces are complete probability spaces. (I think it is true and follows from Tonelli's theorem, but not sure that I'm correct.)",['measure-theory']
829074,Limit of logarithmic function using l'Hospital,"How can I find the following limit: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\alpha x)}{\ln(\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}))}$$ where $\alpha, \ \beta \in \mathbb{R}^+$. My first guess was to use l'Hospital: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\alpha x)}{\ln(\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}))} = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x})(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}) \ \alpha}{(1 + \alpha x) \ \text{e}^{\beta x} \  \beta}$$ But what can I do now? Is my approach correct or is there a simpler method? Edit : Taking the advice from Daniel Fischer, 
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x})(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}) \ \alpha}{(1 + \alpha x) \ \text{e}^{\beta x} \  \beta} = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}) \ \alpha}{(1 + \alpha x)  \  \beta}  \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}(1+\text{e}^{-\beta x}) $$ Applying L'Hospital a second time on the first fraction, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\ln(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}) \ \alpha}{(1 + \alpha x)  \  \beta}  \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}(1+\text{e}^{-\beta x}) = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\alpha  \ \beta \  \text{e}^{\beta x}}{(1+\text{e}^{\beta x}) \ \alpha \ \beta}    \cdot 1 = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\text{e}^{\beta x}}{1+\text{e}^{\beta x} }    \cdot 1  $$ Now let's apply L'Hospital one final time:
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\text{e}^{\beta x}}{1+\text{e}^{\beta x} }    \cdot 1 = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\text{e}^{\beta x}\ \beta}{\text{e}^{\beta x}\ \beta}    \cdot 1 = 1$$ Is this correct?","['logarithms', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

First compute the critical points: $\nabla f(x) =

829182,Pure states and irreducible *-representations,"If $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra, then a $*$-representations of $A$ is irreducible if and only if the corresponding state is a pure state. What happens if don't insist on $A$ being a $C^*$-algebra? Is one of the two directions still true? Are there examples in which this Theorem fails? To give a detailed version of my question: Let $A$ be an unital algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ with involution $*$. Let $\varphi: A \to \mathbb{C}$ be a state, i.e. a $\mathbb{C}$-linear map which satisfies $\varphi(a^* a) \geq 0$ for all $a \in A$ and $\varphi(1)=1$. The set of states on $A$ is convex and we call $\varphi$ a pure state if it is an extreme point of this set. The set $N_{\varphi}=\{a \in A: \varphi(a^*a)=0\}$ is a left ideal of $A$. When does one of the following hold: $\varphi$ is a pure state $\Rightarrow$ $N_{\varphi}$ is a maximal left ideal $\varphi$ is a pure state $\Leftarrow$ $N_{\varphi}$ is a maximal left ideal
? Edit: Why is $N_{\varphi}$ a left ideal? To see this, we first have to prove the CSI: $|\varphi(b^* a)|^2 \leq \varphi(a^*a) \varphi(b^* b)$. We have for all $v=(v_1,v_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ that $\varphi((v_1 a + v_2 b)^* (v_1 a + v_2 b))\geq 0$. This means that the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} \varphi(a^*a) & \varphi(b^* a) \\ \varphi(a^* b) & \varphi(b^*b) \end{pmatrix}$ is positive semidefinite. Taking the determinant implies the CSI. Now using the CSI, the claim is easy: $\varphi((ua)^*ua)=\varphi(a^*(u^*ua))$, thus $\varphi(a^*a)=0$ implies $\varphi((ua)^*ua)=0$. One checks similarly the additive property.","['c-star-algebras', 'noncommutative-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
