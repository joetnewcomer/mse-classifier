3203460,$f$ is non-vanishing holomorphic function on open unit disc such that $|f(z)|\to1$ as $|z|\to1$. Is $f$ constant?,"The whole question looks like- $f$ is a holomorphic function on the interior of the open unit disc
  (say $D$ ) around $0$ and $f(z)\ne0\ \forall z\in D$ . Suppose, $|f(z)|\to1$ as $|z|\to1$ . Is f a constant function? Now, if we remove
  the non-vanishing condition then is $f$ constant? The 2nd part is easy if we take $f(z)=z$ , then $|f(z)|\to1$ as $|z|\to1$ but $f(0)=0$ . For the first part, I tried to show $f'(z)=0\ \forall z\in D$ From application of Cauchy intrgral formula, we know that $f'(z)={1\over 2\pi i}\int_{C} \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^2}d\zeta$ where $z\in D$ and $C$ is a circle around $z$ inside $D$ . So, $|f'(z)|\le\sup\{\frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta-z)^2}|\zeta\in C\}\operatorname{Radius}(C)$ Can use these concepts and the condition $|f(z)|\to1$ as $|z|\to1$ to show $f$ is constant? I even don't know the answer, so may be the $f$ is non-constant. But I think it will be constant. Can anybody solve the problem?

3203835,A projective ideal in an integral domain is finitely generated,"Let $R$ be an integral domain and $I$ a projective ideal. Then $I$ is finitely generated as an $R$ -module. This seems like it should be easy but I don't know what to argue, or where to bring in the integral domain condition. I tried localising at a prime $P$ containing $I$ , and we get that $I_P\subseteq PR_P\subseteq R_P$ is a projective $R_P$ module. Then if $0\to I_P\to R_P\to R_P/I_P\to 0$ is short exact, since projective modules are flat, we can tensor with $I_P$ , and the last term is $0$ . But there is a result that if $M$ is a flat module over a ring then if $J$ is an ideal, then $J\otimes M\cong JM$ . Hence, $I_P^2\cong I_P\otimes I_P\cong R_P\otimes I_P\cong I_P$ .

3203981,All Etale morphisms $X\to\Bbb A^1$,"What are all the etale morphisms from a scheme $X$ to $\Bbb A^1_k$ ? Knowing that $X\to \Bbb A^1_k$ is etale means that $X$ is $1$ -dimensional I think. Additionally, $X$ must admit a zariski open cover by affines, $X=\bigcup_{i\in I} Spec(A_i)$ where each $A_i$ is a $k[t]$ -algebra. So we have that $X$ is covered by $1$ -dimensional affine $k[t]$ -algebras. Additionally, these $U_i=Spec(A_i)$ are taken by open immersion $U_i\to X$ into $X$ , and open immersions are etale, so each of these are etale over $\Bbb A^1_k$ , so we can probably simplify our analysis first to affines over $\Bbb A^1_k$ . In which case we first want to consider $Spec(A_i)\to Spec(k[t])$ morphisms that are etale. I think $A_i$ should be finitely presented as a $k[t]$ -algebra, so of the form $k[t][x_1,\dots,x_n]/(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ where being $1$ -dimensional means that $(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ must cut out an $n$ -dimensional subvariety of $\Bbb A^{n+1}_k$ . I'm not sure if I'm correct at this point, and I'm not sure how to find all of them. I think maybe one can argue like: 1) surjective finite etale morphisms to $\Bbb A^1_k$ are necessarily just isomorphisms $\Bbb A^1_k\to \Bbb A^1_k$ , 2) any etale morphism $X\to \Bbb A^1_k$ can be covered by finite etale morphisms $U_i\to X\to \Bbb A^1_k$ , and composites of etale morphisms are etale 3) ???, 4) profit Bonus: I really would like to understand all etale coverings $\{U_i\to \Bbb A^1_k\}_{i\in I}$ , where the question above was my first obstruction to working this out.

3203989,Finite Morphism is Closed and Open,"I have a question about a statement used in Szamuely's ""Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups"" in the exerpt below (look up at page 152): Let $f:X \to Y$ be a finite and locally free morphism of schemes. Remark: ""locally free"" means that the $\mathcal{O}_Y$ -module $f_* \mathcal{O}_X$ is locally free The author claims that $f$ is (as topol map) closed and open . Why? My ideas: Firstly , regarding closeness it suffice to show that $f$ is proper. The high tech weapon would be the valuative criterion for properness conbining with the fact that finite maps are integral and for integral ring maps $R \to A$ the going up works. Is there exist a more ""elementary"" argument without valuative criterion for ""finite implies proper""? Secondly the author claims that the map is also open by local freeness of $f_* \mathcal{O}_X$ . This sould imply that $f_* \mathcal{O}_X$ has non zero stalks. Why does this imply the openness? UPDATE: Thanks to Alex Youcis' great answer below meanwhile several questions were solved. To only problem I'm still faced is Szamuely's argument that local freeness of $f_* \mathcal{O}_X$ implies that the image $f(X)$ is open. One way - as Alex stated - is to use the fact that locally free imply flat and then argue that flat and finite presentation implies open. That's fine. But from the didactical point of view I'm still interested in Szamuely's argument concretely: he makes the to observation that for all $y \in Y$ the stalk $(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)_y \cong \mathcal{O}^n_{Y,y}$ isn't zero. How does this already imply that the map $f$ is open?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

Then, they claim that using the classification of isometries of $\mathbb{H}$ , such a lift must in fact be the identity. What do they mean by ""bounded distance""?

3204026,Isomorphism of the perfection of two ring,"I was working on Exercise 2.0.4 of Bhatt's notes, which are available here . The exercise states: Let $f\colon R\to S$ be a map of char $p$ rings that is surjective with nilpotent kernel. Then $R^{perf}$ and $S^{perf}$ are isomorphic. Here, $R^{perf}:= \underleftarrow {\lim}R$ , the inverse limit of Frobenius automorphisms of $R$ . My solution: let N be the nilradical of R. We have an exact sequence $$0\to N\to R\to S\to 0.$$ Taking the inverse limit, we have $$0 \to\underleftarrow {\lim}N\to R^{perf}\to S^{perf}$$ exact. So in order to show $R^{perf}$ and $S^{perf}$ are isomorphic, we have to prove that $\underleftarrow {\lim}N$ is zero, which implies that the Frobenius map on $N$ is surjective. However, this isn't always the case.

Proof: Suppose that $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $p>5$ and $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is prime. By the quotient-remainder theorem, $p$ can be written in one of the forms $3q$ or $3q+1$ or $3q+2$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ . In fact, since $p$ is prime and $p\neq3$ and $3\mid 3q$ , $p$ must have one of the forms $3q+1$ or $3q+2$ . Case 1 ( $p=3q+1$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ ): Since $p=3q+1$ , $2p+1=2(3q+1)+1=6q+3=3(2q+1)$ . Let $m=2q+1$ . Then $m\in\mathbb{Z}\because 2,q,1\in\mathbb{Z}$ and sums and products of integers are integers. Thus, substituting, $2p+1=3m$ where $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ . $3\mid (2p+1)\because 3\mid 3m$ . Thus $2p+1$ is prime and $2p+1\neq 3$ and $3\mid (2p+1)$ , which is a contradiction. Hence this case negates one of the premises. Case 2 ( $p=3q+2$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ : Since $p=3q+2$ , $4p+1=4(3q+2)+1=12q+9=3(4q+3)$ . Let $m=4q+3$ . Then $m\in\mathbb{Z}\because 4,q,3\in\mathbb{Z}$ and sums and products of integers are integers. Thus, substituting, $4p+1=3m$ where $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ . $3\mid (4p+1)\because 3\mid 3m$ . Hence $4p+1$ is composite by definition of composite. Cases 1 and 2 show that $\forall p\in\mathbb{Z}, p>5$ and $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is prime $\rightarrow 4p+1$ is composite.

However, if $x\not=\emptyset$ , it shouldn't be true that $x\times y=x$ for any set $y$ , for it should contradict some sort of conclusion of the Axiom of Regularity. Maybe accepting that $A$ is a set different from $\{\emptyset\}$ would lead us to an infinite sequence $(a_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ of the following form: Suppose that $x\not=\emptyset$ and $x\in A$ . Then there exists $a_0\in x$ . But then $a_0\in x\times y$ , so $a_0=\langle a_1,b\rangle$ for some $a_1\in x$ (note that $a_0\not=a_1$ because we would be contradicting the Axiom of Regularity, since we cannot have $\{a_0\}\in a_0$ nor $\{a_0,b\}\in a_0$ ) and $b\in y$ (for if $y=\emptyset$ , then $x\times y=\emptyset\not=x$ , and $x\not\in A$ , contrary to our hypothesis). Note that from the equality $a_0=\langle a_1,b\rangle$ we can conclude that $\{a_1\}\in a_0$ .

Show that the diameter $d=\sup_{z,w\in D}|f(z) − f(w)|$ of the image of f satisfies $2|f'(0)|\leq d$ . Moreover, it can be shown that equality holds precisely when $f$ is linear, $f(z)=a_0 + a_1z$ . This problem is quoted directily from the book. The first part of the question (the inequality) is not difficult once the hint was given. However, I have been thinking about the second part (precisely) for ages. It seems like Exe.9 in the book may have contributions to this question or just say the ""Schwarz Lemma"" related to conformal mappings. But what I am struggling with is I cannot restrict the image of $f$ to get a $D \rightarrow D$ map. Therefore I cannot meet the assumptions of ""Schwarz Lemma"". How can this proposition be proved? Exe.9 (Conclusion): Let $Ω$ be a bounded open subset of $C$ , and $ϕ : Ω → Ω$ a holomorphic function. If there exists a point $z_0 ∈ Ω$ such that $ϕ(z_0) = z_0$ and $ϕ'(z_0) = 1$ then $ϕ$ is linear. Schwarz Lemma: Let $f : D → D$ be holomorphic with $f(0) = 0$ . Then $(i) |f(z)| ≤ |z|$ for all $z ∈ D$ . $(ii)$ If for some $z_0\neq 0$ we have $|f(z_0)| = |z_0|$ , then $f$ is a rotation. $(iii) |f'(0)| ≤ 1$ , and if equality holds, then $f$ is a rotation. Personal solution to the first part: Let $C_r$ denotes the circle of $|\xi|=r$ . Note that, by Cauchy formula, $f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ = $-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(-\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ . Hence, $2f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(\xi)-f(-\xi)}{\xi^2} d\xi$ . Therefore, $2|f'(0)|=|\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{C_r} \frac{f(\xi)-f(-\xi)}{i \xi^2} d\xi| \leq r\sup_{\xi \in C_r} |\frac{f(\xi)-f(-\xi)}{i \xi^2}| \leq \frac{d}{r}$ Since $\forall r \in (0,1)$ the inequality holds, $2|f'(0)|\leq d $ .

3204485,Examples of subgroups where it's nontrivial to show closure under multiplication?,"Usually when a subgroup is declared, it is trivial (or at least straightforward to a sophomore) to prove that it is a subgroup under multiplication. For example: Homomorphic image and preimage of a subgroup Center Intersection of two subgroups Stabilizer of a point in a group action Elements of finite conjugacy class $HN$ , where $H\leq G$ and $N\trianglelefteq G$ I'm looking for interesting theorems where a subset is claimed to be a subgroup, but it is nontrivial to verify. I am looking for some kind of structure-theoretic subgroup that can be defined for any group (or a large class of groups), rather than specific examples that are hard to show closure. I can think of only one example. Let $\Delta(G)$ be those elements with finite conjugacy class (easily seen to be a subgroup), and let $\Delta^+(G)$ be its torsion subset. Note that $g$ has finite conjugacy class in $G$ if and only if $[G:C(g)]<\infty$ where $C(g)$ is the centralizer. $$\Delta^+(G):=\{g\in G : |\langle g\rangle|<\infty, [G:C(g)]<\infty\}.$$ Theorem: $\Delta^+(G)$ is closed under multiplication. The proof takes 1-2 pages of nontrivial calculations. If $a,b$ are torsion, it's not true that their product $ab$ is torsion --- but amazingly, it is true if $a,b$ have only finitely many conjugates. Does anyone have any other examples? Proof of the Theorem, for those interested. You can see it from the following (nontrivial) lemma. Lemma (Dietzmann). If $[G:Z(G)]<\infty$ , then $[G,G]$ is finite. Modulo the (page long) proof of this, let's see why it implies the theorem. Let $x,y\in \Delta^+(G)$ so that $x,y$ have finite conjugacy classes and orders. Clearly $xy$ has a finite conjugacy class, so we just have to show that it has finite order. Let $N$ be the subgroup generated by all the conjugates of $x$ and $y$ , so that $N$ is finitely-generated. Then $N/N'$ is an abelian group generated by finitely many torsion elements, hence finite, so $[N:N']<\infty$ . It is thus enough to show $N'$ is finite, because then $N$ is finite, and since $xy\in N$ this completes the proof. To show $N'$ is finite we use Dietzmann's Lemma: notice $Z(N)=C_N(x)\cap C_N(y)$ , and these centralizers have finite index in $N$ . Therefore $[N:Z(N)]<\infty$ and we apply Dietzmann's Lemma. This was already a somewhat lengthy and interesting argument, and we haven't even proved Dietzmann's Lemma yet! Edit: a related question is as follows.

3204727,Stone Duality: What are $\sigma$-Algebras Dual To?,"Stone duality, one of many dualities between certain lattices and certain topological spaces, asserts that there is a contravariant categorical equivalence between the category $\text{Bool}$ of boolean algebras and the category $\text{Stone}$ of stone spaces. For those who are not familiar with this, here is a brief statement of what this says: Definition: A boolean algebra is a partially ordered set $A$ such that 1) $A$ has finite meets and finite joins, including the empty join. 2) Meets distribute over joins in $A$ 3) For each $a \in A$ , there is $b$ such that $a \vee b$ is the greatest element, and $a \wedge b$ is the least element. (1) says that $A$ is a bounded lattice, (1) and (2) say that $A$ is a bounded distributive lattice, and (3) says that $A$ is complemented. Definition: A stone space $X$ is a space occuring as the cofiltered limit $\text{limit}\ X_i$ of discrete spaces in the category of topological spaces. One functor $\text{Spec} : \text{Bool} \rightarrow \text{Stone}$ sends a boolean algebra $A$ to $\text{Bool}(A, \{ 0, 1 \})$ of maps of boolean algebras from $A$ to the boolean algebra $\{ 0, 1\}$ . The other sends a stone space $X$ to $\text{Stone}(X, \{ 0, 1\})$ , the set of maps of stone spaces from $X$ to $\{ 0, 1\}$ . I am interested in how this might work for $\sigma$ -algebras. A $\sigma$ -algebra is a subalgebra of the boolean algebra $P(X)$ (power set of a set) closed under countable meets (and therefore countable joins). By the categorical equivalence, $\sigma$ -algebras $A$ on $X$ correspond to certain quotient objects of $\hat{X}$ , the profinite completion of $X$ (inverse limit over all quotients onto a finite set). Question: Let $X$ be a set. Can we characterize the quotient stone spaces of $\hat{X}$ corresponding to $\sigma$ -algebras in $P(X)$ ? Note: it was mentioned in the comments that $\sigma$ -algebra can also refer to an ambient boolean algebra which has countable meets (and therefore countable joins). Here I mean to specifically fix an embedding into $P(X)$ , and for joins and meets in the $\sigma$ -algebr to match joins and meets in $P(X)$ .","['boolean-algebra', 'measure-theory', 'category-theory', 'general-topology', 'duality-theorems']"

We see that our own equilibrium is $(0,0)$ since setting $x'=0$ we get $$y^{2k}=-x^2$$ Which only works for $x=y=0$ Therefore our system is asymptotically stable at the origin. I am having trouble with b.), mostly because the hint is confusing me. Let $y=ax$ , then our system becomes $$x'=-x^3-a^2x^3=-x^3(1+a^2)$$ $$y'=-a^3x^3-ax^3=-ax^3(1+a^2)$$ I am not sure what to do with this. Using linearization doesn't work since the Jacobian will be the zero vector at the point of interest. I have never had a problem that asks to draw a phase portrait when linearization doesn't work, so I am hoping someone more clever than me can offer some advice.","['stability-in-odes', 'lyapunov-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3205220,What is the largest square that can fit in a dodecagon and not rotate?,"I am an engineer in the oil field and I am trying to find a socket that can fit around a square drive pin. I am trying to prove this for fun before I just draw it on CAD and measure it. I believe sockets have six or twelve sides. I have had some success calculating the largest hexagonal wrench that can fit on a square drive, but it came out very large and I remember that it was not this large of a tool when I worked in the field. The problem is that when you add this extra point in a hexagon making it a decagon, it allows the square to rotate. The square drive is d=.750 and I came out with x=(sqrt(5)/(3-sqrt(3))d, where x is the width across two sides of a hexagon. The proof of the hexagon starts with the fact that the largest square inside of a hexagon shares the same center. Its a strange proof that I dont understand, but it can be found here: http://www.drking.org.uk/hexagons/misc/deriv3.html . This web page gives us the result that (1) d=(3-sqrt(3))a. Then I derived (2) a=x/sqrt(5) using the Pythagorean therom. From there, I substituted (2) into (1). and got the result x~1.764d, x~1.323 when d=.750. I know this cant be right. I could calculate the diagonals of the square drive and set that equal to the diagonals of the dodecagon. From there I could probably find the distance between two sides of the dodecagon and that would be a starting point, but I'd rather find a relation and proof for largest square inside a dodecagon that cannot rotate. I know aligning the square diagonals with the dodecagon diagonals would not be correct because I do not think this is how you'd want to start this proof.",['geometry']
3205228,Is the normalized derivative of a holomorphic function Sobolev?,"Let $B=\{z\in \mathbb C \,|\,|z|\le 1\}$ be the closed unit disk, and let $f:B \to \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic. More precisely, I assume that $f$ is holomorphic on the interior $\text{int}(B)$ , and smooth on the closed disk $B$ . Assume also that $f'(z) \neq 0$ almost everywhere on $B$ . Are the derivatives of $\frac{f'(z)}{\|f'(z)\|}$ in $L^1(B)$ ? More precisely, if $f=u+iv$ , then $f'(z)=u_x+iv_x$ , and I consider $$h(x,y)=\frac{u_x}{\sqrt{u_x^2+v_x^2}},g(x,y)=\frac{v_x}{\sqrt{u_x^2+v_x^2}}.$$ The question is whether or not $h_x,h_y,g_x,g_y \in L^1(B)$ . I can show that for any $\epsilon >0$ , the derivatives are integrable on $\{z\in \mathbb C:|z|\le 1-\epsilon\}$ . The ""remaining part"" of the question is to determine what happens near the boundary. I thought that if $f'(z) \neq 0$ a.e., then $f'(z)$ may vanish only at finitely many points, but this is not true in general , since we have a non-empty boundary (where the usual identity theorem doesn't work). So, the case where $f'(z)$ has infinitely many zeros (with an accumulation point on the boundary) is still open. Here is a solution for the case where $f'$ has only finitely many zeroes: (this implies that we are OK on every disk of radius $1-\epsilon$ ). This problem reduces to analyzing what happens around a single zero, say at $z=0$ . We can write $f'(z)=z^ng(z)$ for some holomorphic function $g$ satisfying $g(0) \neq 0$ . Then $\frac{f'(z)}{\|f'(z)\|}=\frac{z^n}{\|z^n\|}\frac{g(z)}{\|g(z)\|}$ . $g$ is smooth and non-zero in a neighbourhood of $z=0$ , so the factor $\frac{g(z)}{\|g(z)\|}$ causes no problems. We are left with $\frac{z^n}{\|z^n\|}=(\frac{z}{\|z\|})^n=e^{in\theta}$ , which reduces the problem to the analysis of the ""argument function"" $\theta$ (i.e. the case of $\frac{z}{\|z\|}$ ).

I have encountered myself with the following exercise: Let $\langle A, <_R\rangle$ and $\langle B, <_S\rangle$ be two linearly ordered sets so that each one is isomorphic to a subset of the other, that is, there exists $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$ such that: $$\langle A,<_R\rangle\cong\langle B',<_S\cap(B'\times B')\rangle\qquad\&\qquad\langle B,<_S\rangle\cong\langle A',<_R\cap(A'\times A')\rangle$$ Is it necessarily true that $\langle A,<_R\rangle\cong\langle B,<_S\rangle$ ? The original statement talked about well-ordered sets, but that case is pretty easy, because supposing that $\langle B',<_S\cap(B'\times B')\rangle$ is not isomorphic to $\langle B,<_S\rangle$ , the theorem of comparison between well-ordered sets assures that $B'$ with its restricted relation $<_S$ is isomorphic to an initial section of $\langle B,<_S\rangle$ . But then, composing the unique isomorphism between $A$ and $B'$ with the restriction to $B'$ of the only isomorphism between $B$ and $A'$ , we find that $A$ is isomorphic to a subset of $A$ with strict upper bounds (namely, the image of the element of $B$ that defines the initial section of $B'$ via the isomorphism between $B$ and $A'$ ) in the sense of $<_R$ , which is absurd. However, when the sets are not well-ordered, can we find a couple of linearly ordered sets that, although verifying the stated property, are not isomorphic to each other?

Now, since $y \in [0,1]$ , $0 \leq z-x \leq 1$ , hence the region of integration for computing $f_Z(z)$ is something like Therefore, for $-1\leq z < 0$ (the blue triangle) $$f_Z(z) = \int_{-1}^{z}\frac{1}{2} dx = \frac{z+1}{2}\,,$$ for $0\leq z < 2$ (the red parallelogram) $$f_Z (z) = \int_{z-1}^{z}\frac{1}{2}\,dx = \frac{1}{2}\,,$$ and for $2 \leq z\leq 3$ (the green triangle) $$f_Z(z) = \int_{z-1}^{2}\frac{1}{2}\,dx = \frac{3-z}{2}.$$ So the density of $Z$ is trapezoid when it should be a triangle with vertex at 1.

If the non-trivial elements of $N$ form a single conjugacy class of $G$ , prove that $N$ is abelian.

Anyway I thought it's quite a trivial integral so I'm gonna solve it quickly, but I am having some hard time to finish it. I went on with Feynman's trick: $$I(a)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln((1+x^2)a+x)}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(a)=\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{a+x+ax^2}$$ $$=\frac1a\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\left(x+\frac{1}{2a}\right)^2+1-\frac{1}{4a^2}}=\frac{1}{a}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{4a^2}}}\arctan\left(\frac{x+\frac{1}{2a}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{4a^2}}}\right)\bigg|_0^\infty$$ $$=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}-\frac{2}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}\arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}\right)=\frac{2\arctan\left(\sqrt{4a^2-1}\right)}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}$$ We can prove easily via the substitution $x\to \frac{1}{x}$ that $I(0)=0$ so we have that: $$I=I(1)-I(0)=2\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan\left(\sqrt{4a^2-1}\right)}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}da$$ Now I thought about two substitutions: $$ \overset{a=\frac12\cosh x}=\int_{\operatorname{arccosh}(0)}^{\operatorname{arccosh}(2)} \arctan(\sinh x)dx$$ $$\overset{a=\frac12\sec x}=\int_{\operatorname{arcsec}(0)}^{\frac{\pi}{3}}\frac{x}{\cos x}dx$$ But in both cases the lower bound is annoying and I think I am missing something here (maybe obvious).
So I would love to get some help in order to finish this. Edit: We can apply once again Feynman's trick. First consider: $$I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{2\arctan(t\sqrt{4a^2-1})}{\sqrt{4a^2-1}}da\Rightarrow I'(t)=2\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t^2(4a^2-1)}da$$ $$=\frac{1}{t\sqrt{1-t^2}}\arctan\left(\frac{2at}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\right)\bigg|_0^1=\frac{1}{t\sqrt{1-t^2}}\arctan\left(\frac{2t}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\right)$$ So once again we have $I(0)=0$ , so $I=I(1)-I(0)$ . $$\Rightarrow I=\int_0^1\frac{1}{t\sqrt{1-t^2}}\arctan\left(\frac{2t}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\right)dt\overset{t=\sin x}=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\arctan(2\tan x)}{\sin x}dx$$ At this point Mathematica can evaluate the integral to be: $$I=\frac{\pi}{3}\ln(2+\sqrt 3)+\frac43G$$ I didn't try the last integral yet, but I am thinking of Feynman again $\ddot \smile$ . Edit 2: Found that I already was on it some time ago, and actually posted it here , which means I have solved it before using Feynman's trick, but right now I can't remember how I did it. So given the circumstances I am positive that it can be solved starting with my approach, but if you have any other ways then feel free to share it.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'closed-form']"

So for $\alpha \in [0,1]\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ , I define $f_{\alpha} \in B\left([0,1]\right)$ by $$f_{\alpha}(x) = \left\{ \begin{array} 11, \, x = \alpha \\0, \text{ otherwise} 
\end{array} \right.$$ Is this construction valid? Aren't sequences indexed by the naturals? Maybe I should call this a family of functions... Anyways, from here, I suppose that $M$ is dense in $B([0,1])$ . Then, for any ball $V_{\alpha}$ around a particular $f_{\alpha}$ , that ball must contain an element of $M$ . By the way the metric I'm using is $$d(x,y) = \sup_{t\in [0,1]}|x(t) - y(t)|$$ Considering $V_\alpha$ with radius $1/3$ we have $$V_{\alpha}\left(f_{\alpha}; \frac{1}{3}\right) = \left\{ f  \in B([0,1]) : d(f,f_{\alpha}) < \frac{1}{3} \right\}$$ so $V_\alpha \cap M \neq \emptyset$ , but $V_\alpha \cap V_\beta = \emptyset$ since $d(f_\alpha, f_\beta) = 1$ , for the functions described above. Therefore, I conclude that any dense set $M$ in $B([0,1])$ is uncountable, since it has an uncountable subset*. *Specifically the uncountable subset is $$\left(V_\alpha \cap M\right) \cup \left(V_\beta \cap M\right) \cup \cdots$$ Just looking for guidance/verification on the proof, not an answer necessarily.

This is how I determined the range: Since $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x} - 3}$ , it's easy to see that $y \neq 0$ , since the numerator isn't $0$ .

What I don't understand however, is that physicists don't care what functions they apply the $\delta$ -Distribution to. I have multiple times seen the $\delta$ -Distribution be applied to polynomials or sinuses, which are clearly not elements of the Schwartz-space, as they are not falling. 
So my question is: How can one rigorously define the use of the $\delta$ -Distribution, or of any other tempered Distribution in general, on a bigger class of functions, like polymials? EDIT: I allready understand that physicists don't always care about rigorosity, yet I'd like to know wether there is a way to make the described procedure of applying tempered distributions to continuous functions rigorous.","['functions', 'dirac-delta', 'distribution-theory']"
3206552,A reference for an explicit statement of the Galois correspondence in a Galois category,"The definition of a Galois category was cooked up intentionally to create the general setting where Galois correspondences appear. There are plenty of the resources (e.g. here and here ) that go into detail about Galois categories, their properties, etc. However, I have not been able to find a source that explicitly states and proves the Galois correspondence in this general setting. Is there a resource that does this?","['category-theory', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-geometry', 'galois-connections', 'algebraic-topology']"
3206556,Why can we use a consistent variance matrix estimator when finding the asymptotic distribution,"So I am pretty sure that in a one-dimensional case, we would just say $x \overset{d}{\to} N(0,\sigma^2)$ and $s^2 \overset{p}{\to} \sigma^2$ so $\frac{s}{\sigma} \frac{x}{s} \overset{d}{\to} N(0,1)$ and the first fraction converges to 1 so $x \overset{d}{\to} N(0,s^2)$ from Cramer Slutsky theorem. Trying to do this with a multivariate distribution, I used the Cholesky decomposition to say the variance matrix has a ""square root"" (because a variance matrix by definition has to be positive semidefinite) and applied the same principle: $X \overset{d}{\to} N(0,\Sigma)$ and $S \overset{p}{\to} \Sigma$ , we get $\Sigma^{1/2} X \overset{d}{\to} N(0,I)$ and $S^{1/2} S^{-1/2} \Sigma^{1/2} X \overset{d}{\to} N(0,I)$ . My issue, however, is I don't actually know if $S^{-1/2} \Sigma^{1/2} \overset{p}{\to} I$ necessarily holds. So is this true? If not, how else could I show that asymptotic distribution holds when we use the consistent variance estimator?","['matrices', 'statistics', 'variance', 'probability']"
3206602,"If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $g$ equals $f$ except at $x=c\in(a,b)$ then $\int_{a}^{b} f = \int_{a}^{b} g$.","If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $g$ equals $f$ except at $x=c \in (a,b)$ where $g$ is defined arbitrarily. Then prove that $g$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and $\int_{a}^{b} f =
\int_{a}^{b} g$ . Here's my attempt: I will be using this to prove it: Let $f$ be bounded on $[a,b]$ and continuous everywhere except at one
  point $c$ in $[a,b]$ . Then $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ . Clearly, if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , then there is some $M\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $|f(x)| \le M$ . Hence, it must be that $|g(x)| \le \max \{ M , g(c) \} $ . Hence, $g(x)$ is bounded above and is continuous on $[a,b]$ except at $x=c$ . Thus, by the theorem above, it is integrable. Now, we need to show that $\int_{a}^{b} f =\int_{a}^{b} g$ . If we assume that $f(c) < g(c)$ (the other case may be handled similarly), then $f(x) \le g(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$ and so, $\int_{a}^{b} f \le \int_{a}^{b} g$ . Let $\varepsilon >0$ be given. Then there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $\int_{a}^{b} g - \varepsilon  < L(P,g)$ . Now we claim that for any partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ , we have $L(P,g)=L(P,f)$ (we prove this claim later). Hence it follows that $\int_{a}^{b} g - \varepsilon  < L(P,g) = L(P,f) \le \int_{a}^{b} f$ . Since, $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, we have $\int_{a}^{b} g \le \int_{a}^{b} f$ . Hence, $\int_{a}^{b} f =
\int_{a}^{b} g$ . Proof of my claim: Let $P$ be any partition of $[a,b]$ . We need to show that $L(P,g) = L(P,f)$ . First, we note that there must be some $i$ such that $c\in[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]$ . Also, $f(x) \le g(x)$ on $[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]$ , hence, $\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} f(x) \le \inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} g(x)$ . Also, since $f$ is continuous on $[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]$ , there must be some $y\in[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]$ such that $f(y) =\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} f(x)$ by the Extreme Value Theorem. If $y \ne c$ then it is clear that $f(y) = g(y) =\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} g(x)$ otherwise if $y=c$ , then for any $\varepsilon >0$ , $\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} g(x) \le g(z)=f(z) < f(c)+\varepsilon$ for some $z \in [x_{i-1}, x_{i}]\setminus \{c\}$ ( for otherwise it would contradict our assumption that $f(c) < g(c)$ ). Since, $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} g(x) \le  f(c)$ . Thus, $\inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} f(x) = \inf_{[x_{i-1} , x_{i}]} g(x)$ . Since, this is true for the rest of the subintervals as well, we must have that $L(P,g) = L(P,f)$ . Is my proof correct? I'm a bit unsure about the last part. Any alternative proofs? EDIT: Found a easier way to complete the second part . Thanks to the hint provided by Kavi Rama Murthy. Since, we've established that $g$ is integrable, consider the function $h:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $h(x)=f(x)-g(x)$ . Then $h$ is integrable. Also, note that we're assuming here that $f(c) < g(c)$ . Let $P$ be any partition of $[a,b]$ . Then $U(P,h)=0$ because $M_k(h)=0$ for any subintervals. Hence, it must be that $\int_{a}^{b} h = \overline{\int_{a}^{b}} h = \inf \{ U(P,h) \} =0$ . Thus, again by linearity, we have $\int_{a}^{b} f = \int_{a}^{b}g$ .","['alternative-proof', 'proof-verification', 'riemann-integration', 'real-analysis']"
