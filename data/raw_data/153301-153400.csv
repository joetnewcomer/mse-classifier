2578996,Relation between inclusion-exclusion principle and maximum-minimums identity,"Inclusion-exclusion principle states that the size of the union of $n$ finite sets is given by the sum of the sizes of all sets minus sum of the sizes of all the pairwise intersections plus sum of the sizes of all the triple intersections and so on:
$$
\left| A_1\cup \dots \cup A_n\right| = \sum_i \left| A_i\right|-\sum_{i<j} \left| A_i\cap A_j\right|+\sum_{i<j<k} \left| A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\dots+(-1)^{n+1}\left| A_1\cap \dots \cap A_n\right|.
$$
Maximum-minimums identity states that the maximum of a finite set of numbers $S = \{x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ is given by the sum of all elements minus the sum of minimums of all pairs of elements plus sum of minimums of all triples and so on:
$$
\max\{x_1, \dots,x_n\} = \sum_i x_i -\sum_{i<j}\min\{x_i, x_j\} + \sum_{i<j<k}\min\{x_i, x_j,x_k\}-\dots+(-1)^{n+1}\min\{x_1,\dots, x_n\}.

2578997,Law of large numbers problem and calculation of max expected value,"We've got to prove that $\frac{M_{n}}{\ln(n)}\rightarrow 1$ a.s. Where $M_{n}=\max\left\{{X_{1},...,X_{n}}\right\}$ , with $X_{i}\sim \mathrm{exp}(1)$ i.i.d. So it is obvious that we will have to use the Law of Large Numbers. First I thought to rewrite it as $\frac{M_{n}}{n}\frac{n}{\ln(n)}$, and apply LLN for first fraction and take the limit for the second one, but $\frac{n}{\ln(n)}$ diverges. My second thought was to calculate Cdf of $M_{n}$ and apply LLN for $S_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}M_{k}$ and see if I take something like the following $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{S_{n}}{n}\rightarrow \ln(n)$ But I don't know how to derive $\mathbb{E}(M_{n})$ (the cdf of $M_{n}$ is $(1-e^{-x})^{n}$ , for $x\geq 0$).

2579257,Product rule proof. Derivatives.,"I've been asked to proof the product rule. 
I am fine with that, my proof was accepted completely.
Nevertheless, for me personally the very last step seems to be not totally incorrect, but, let say, ""intuitive"" or ""inductive"" to some extend. 
Not to confuse people, will mention few fateful points of my reasoning: At some moment I've proved that:
$$f(x + \delta) = A + B \times \delta + o(E(\delta))$$
where: $o(E(\delta))$ means ""of less order than $\delta$"", i.e.
$\lim_{\delta \to 0}\frac{E(\delta)}{\delta} = 0$; $A = f(x)$; $B = f'(x)$. After that I took both $f(x + \delta)$ and $g(x + \delta)$ assumed to be differentiable at the point $x$. Hence:
$$f(x + \delta) \times g(x + \delta) = [f(x) + f'(x)\delta + o(E(\delta))] \times [g(x) + g'(x)\delta + o(E(\delta))]$$
$$= f(x)g(x) + [f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)] \times \delta + \biggl( [f(x) + f'(x)\delta]o(E(\delta)) + [g(x) + g'(x)\delta]o(E(\delta)) + [o(E(\delta))]^2\biggr)$$ HERE GOES MY QUESTION: I've noticed that the last equation could be reformulated as:
$$A = f(x)g(x)$$
$$B = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)$$
$$o(E(\delta)) = \biggl( [f(x) + f'(x)\delta]o(E(\delta)) + [g(x) + g'(x)\delta]o(E(\delta)) + [o(E(\delta))]^2\biggr)$$ The question is: shouldn't I proof somehow (have no idea how, actually) that the pattern above is applicable here?

2579500,Combination of probabilities for probability densities,"If I have an experiment with discrete probabilities like drawing black and white balls, the probability of drawing both black and white is just a multiplication of probabilities of drawing black and white. Similarly, if I want to work with ""OR"" type of situations, I add the probabilities. But how does this work with continuous random variables?
Say, I have the following experiment: I have a large bucket of some material and I am trying to determine the melt temperature. So I take small samples and put them on a burner and note the temperature when they melt. Let's assume that after many of such measurements, I get a gaussian with some mean value and variance. If I then would like to say something about another bucket of the same material, I might ask, what is the probability of a sample melting at temperature between $(T,T+{\rm d}T)$. Then the probability should be $\Pr(\text{melt at }T)\approx f(T)\,{\rm d} T$ or more exactly $\int_T^{T+{\rm d}T}f(x)\,{\rm d} x$ where $f(T)$ is the gaussian. But what if I want to ask about two samples from taken from the bucket both melting at $\{T,T+{\rm d}T\}$ or one of the samples from the bucket melting between  $(T_1,T_1+{\rm d}T)$ and the other from the bucket melting  between $(T_2,T_2+{\rm d}T)$? Is it just $f^2(T)\,{\rm d}x^2$ and $f(T_1)f(T_2)\,{\rm d}x^2$ respectively? Or more exactly $$\int_T^{T+{\rm d}T}f(x)\,{\rm d} x\int_T^{T+{\rm d}T}f(x)\,{\rm d} x$$ or $$
\int_{T_1}^{T_1+{\rm d}T} f(x){\rm d} x \int_{T_2}^{T_2+{\rm d}T}f(x)\,{\rm d} x
$$ But this leads to having new probability distribution functions $f(x)f(y)$ which from what I have read are not necessarily distribution functions. And if I want to ask about the probability of the melt temperature being between $(T_1, T_1+{\rm d}T)$ or between $(T_2,T_2+{\rm d}T)$, would it be $f(T_1)\,{\rm d}T + f(T_2)\,{\rm d}T$ or more precisely $$\int_{T_1}^{T_1+{\rm d}T} f(x)\,{\rm d} x + \int_{T_2}^{T_2+{\rm d}T} f(x)\,{\rm d} x\text{?}$$","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"

For example I tried the obvious $ f(x,y ) =\frac{x - y}{| x- y|}$, which breaks down when $x=y$ and I then tried ( in an attempt to make the result at $x=y$ finite) $ f(x,y) = e^{-\frac{x - y}{| x- y|}}$. This has a similar problem for $\frac{x - y}{| x- y|}$ can be both positive and negative infinity,when $x = y$ or better(?) as $x$ approaches $y$. In fact, maybe asking for the existence of such a function is a bit to broad. Apart from that, of course such a function exists, one can simply define one. So I ask, can you find such a function.

There's an urn with an infinite number of balls, from which one can draw as many times as one wants. The balls have $n$ different colours, and the probability a ball has a certain colour is $1/n$. For instance, if there are two colours, red and green, there's a 50% chance of a ball being red, but problem is that the number of colours is unknown. Given that a person has made $m$ draws, of which there are $m_1$ occurences of the colour $c_1$, $m_2$ occurences of the colour $c_2$ $\ldots$ $m_n$ occurences of colour $c_n$ (so that $m = m_1+m_2+\cdots+m_n$, not all necessarily non-zero), how can one estimate the total number of colours $n$? If there's only one colour ($n=1$), one would expect to draw $c_1c_1c_1c_1\cdots$, but after a finite number of draws, one would still only have a probability that there's only one colour, and never be certain. But intuitively, one should be able to exclude large $n$s with a high probability, so how would $\mathbb{P}(n\,|\,\underbrace{c_1,c_1,c_1,\ldots,c_1}_{m})$ be distributed, and how would the general case look like? $$

Exercise 1-3.7. Give several examples of a set $\mathcal{X}$ such that each element
of $\mathcal{X}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{X}$. Stoll, Robert R.. Set Theory and Logic (Dover Books on Mathematics)
(Kindle Locations 482-483). Dover Publications. Kindle Edition. This is from the introductory chapter on intuitive set theory .
Terms such as predicate and symbols such as $\implies$ and
$\iff$ have not yet been introduced. Nor has any formal logic. So this is my assessment of the situation: A set is a collection of all entities which satisfy some predicate
$P$. That is $\mathcal{X}=\left\{ x\vert P\left[x\right]\right\} $
is a set if $P\left[x\right]$ is always either true or else false. The statement $\mathcal{Y}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{X}$ may be written
symbolically as$\mathcal{Y}\subseteq\mathcal{X}\iff y\in\mathcal{Y}\implies y\in\mathcal{X}$. Here is an example of a set whose elements are not subsets of the
set. $\mathcal{A}=\left\{ a_{1},a_{2}\right\} $. The subsets of $\mathcal{A}$
are $\emptyset$,$\mathcal{A}$, $\left\{ a_{1}\right\} $ and $\left\{ a_{2}\right\} $,
so $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are not subsets of $\mathcal{A}$. I can write the expression $\mathcal{S}=\left\{ x\vert x\subseteq\mathcal{S}\right\} $,
and claim it meets the criteria. But, if I enumerate the elements
$\mathcal{S}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\dots\right\} $, the subsets might
be understood to be $\mathscr{P}\left[\mathcal{S}\right]=\left\{ \emptyset,\mathcal{S},\left\{ x_{1}\right\} ,\left\{ x_{2}\right\} ,\left\{ x_{1},x_{2}\right\} ,\dots\right\} $.
But, since it was predicated that $x_{i}\subseteq\mathcal{S}$, perhaps
$\mathscr{P}\left[\mathcal{S}\right]=\left\{ \emptyset,\mathcal{S},x_{1},x_{2},\dots,\left\{ x_{1}\right\} ,\left\{ x_{2}\right\} ,\left\{ x_{1},x_{2}\right\} ,\dots\right\} $. Assume $\mathcal{S}$ has a finite number of elements, say two, for
simplicity. Then $\mathscr{P}\left[\mathcal{S}\right]=\left\{ \emptyset,\mathcal{S},x_{1},x_{2},\left\{ x_{1}\right\} ,\left\{ x_{2}\right\} \right\} $,
so the power set of $\mathcal{S}$ has $6$ elements. But the power set of a set of two elements should on have $4$ elements. That indicates to me that any set satisfying the criteria of the exercise
would have to be infinite. Even if I consider infinite sets, I'm still not comfortable with including
the elements as subsets. Is this a trick question? Or is there some way around this seeming
contradiction?","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Some options: Mercer's representation theorem: $K(x,y)$ can be written as a linear combination of $\phi(x)\phi(y)$ where $\phi$ are the eigenfunctions of $K$ Riesz representer theorem: If $H$ is an RKHS, there exists a positive definite kernel function $K$ in which all functions in $H$ can be written this way.

I also got how it works for parabolas opening left/right or opening up/down. Now I was wondering, how does it work in the general case, for example, if the parabola is opening to the ""top-right"" or such. On wikipedia I found the general formula for this: If the focus is $F=(f_{1},f_{2})$ and the directrix $ax+by+c=0$ one gets the equation $$\frac{(ax+by+c)^2}{a^2+b^2} = (x-f_1)^2+(y-f_2)^2$$ (The left side of the equation uses the Hesse normal form of a line to calculate the distance $|Pl|$ .) With the right side I'm familiar, it calculcates delta $x$ and delta $y$ and we equal that to the left side, the distance of some point $(x, y)$ and the directrix. But I found the left side is giving me trouble, I read the linked wiki article on the Hesse normal form, but it didn't make it very clear to me how the distance there is calculated.

If $\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\left|\dfrac{f(z+z_{0})-f(z_{0})}{z}\right|$ exists, then either $f$ or $\overline{f}$ is complex-differentiable at $z=z_{0}$. ""Proof"": Denote 
\begin{align*}
L=\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\left|\dfrac{f(z+z_{0})-f(z_{0})}{z}\right|,

we have 
\begin{align*}
L^{2}=\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(z+z_{0})-f(z_{0})}{z}\cdot\dfrac{\overline{f}(z+z_{0})-\overline{f}(z_{0})}{\overline{z}}
\end{align*}
realizing $z=x+i\cdot0$ and $z=0+iy$ respectively we get
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\cdot\dfrac{\partial\overline{f}}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\cdot\dfrac{\partial\overline{f}}{\partial y},

so
\begin{align*}
\left|\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|^{2}=-\left|\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|^{2},

\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}=0,

$\newcommand{\de}{\delta}$ Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold, and let $e_i$ be a local frame for $TM$. We also choose some fixed differential forms $\omega \in \Omega^k(M),\eta \in \Omega^{k+1}(M)$. Consider the following vector field: $$
X=\IP{e^i \wedge \omega }{\eta}e_i \tag{1}
$$ (The inner product on forms is the one induced by the metric on $M$). I claim $X$ is well-defined, i.e does not depend on the chosen frame $e_i$. Is there a ""conceptual proof"" for that? I have a proof which is nothing but a routine calculation (see below), but I wonder if there is a nicer explanation for why this ""magic"" happens. (BTW, this vector field, or more precisely its divergence, arises naturally when trying to compute a formula for the coderivative ). For completeness, here is my proof: Let $f_i$ be a different frame for $TM$, and let $f^j,e^i$ be the dual bases of $f_j,e_i$ respectively. Write 
$$
f_i=A_i^{j}e_j,f^i=B_j^i e^j.
$$
We claim $A=B^{-1}$. Indeed,
$$
\de^i_k= f^i(f_k)=B_j^ie^j(A_k^se_s)=B_j^iA_k^s\de^j_s=\sum_j B_j^iA_k^j=(BA)_{ik}.

$$ Edit: Here is summary of Andreas and levap's suggestions: Let $V$ be a real vector space. Fix $\omega \in  \Lambda^{k}  V^*,\eta \in  \Lambda^{k+1}  V^*$. Look at the bilinear map: $V^* \times V \to \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \otimes \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \otimes V$ defined by $$(\hat{\omega}, v) \to \eta \otimes (\hat{\omega} \wedge \omega) \otimes v.$$ This map induces a linear map $\Phi:V^* \otimes V \to \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \otimes \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \otimes V$, $$\Phi(\hat{\omega}\otimes v) := \eta \otimes (\hat{\omega} \wedge \omega) \otimes v.$$ Now, put an inner product on $\Lambda^{k+1}  V^*$ (which can be induced by a product on $V$ in a natural way, or not, it does not matter). This product, which by definition is a bilinear map $\Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \times \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \to \mathbb{R}$ induces a linear map
$ \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \otimes \Lambda^{k+1}  V^* \to \mathbb{R}$.

It is this fact that, which holds for any frame $e_i$, which lies in the heart of the ""basis-independence"" of the vector field defined in $(1)$. Indeed, $$ \Phi(\text{Id}_V)=\Phi(e^i \otimes e_i) = \eta \otimes (e^i \wedge \omega) \otimes e_i,$$ and $$ \Psi \circ \Phi:\text{Hom}(V,V) \to V.$$ Finally, definition $(1)$ is nothing but setting $$ X:=\Psi \circ \Phi (\text{Id}_V)=\Psi\big(\eta \otimes (e^i \wedge \omega) \otimes e_i\big)=\IP{\eta }{e^i \wedge \omega }e_i.$$","['riemannian-geometry', 'change-of-basis', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

My idea might be to do something of a dog bone contour to avoid the branch, but I've been having trouble keeping track of the evaluation. Doing it this way, the sum of the integrals would have to be zero, there are no poles involved. Thankfully the outer arcing contours would go to zero, it's really the contour going around the sneaky branch cut that would be cumbersome. Perhaps a dog bone would work?

2580659,On the definition of the geodesic curvature and its relation to concepts from Riemannian geometry,"In the paper that can be found in this link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00082.pdf there is a definition of the geodesic curvature that I can't quite understand. Here is how this article presents it: Let $\vec{X}(s)$ be a curve on a 2D manifold in $R^3$ which is parametrized by 
the arc length $s$ as shown in the following figure. Choose a vector function $\vec{V}(s)$ living in the tangent space at the position $\vec{X}(s)$ and is paralely transported along the curve. Then $k_g=\frac{d\theta}{ds}$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector $\vec{T}=\frac{d\vec{X}(s)}{ds}$ and $\vec{V}(s)$, is defined as the geodesic curvature. The paper states that the geodesic curvature $k_g$  reflects the deviation of the curve from the local geodesics. What I don't understand are the following: $1)$ Since $\vec{T}=\frac{d\vec{X}(s)}{ds}$ and $\vec{V}(s)$ are both parallely transported along the curve(former is a velocity vector and later is given), then shouldn't the angle between them remain constant? In Riemannian geometry, when we parallel transport a vector along a curve, its angle with the velocity vector of the curve remain constant. Is it that the author might not use an affine connection that is compatible with the metric, which is the property that an affine connection needs in order to preserve lengths of vectors and angles between vectors during parallel transport? (see for example Do Carmo's Riemannian geometry, p.53 on Riemannian connections) $2)$ How does the geodesic curvature relate to the Riemannian curvature found in Riemannian geometry? Also, is it an intrinsic quantity or an extrinsic one? Finally, how does it generalize to higher-dimensional manifolds that are not embedded in higher-dimensional manifolds?","['connections', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"

The notion of (Borel)-measurable functions generalizes continuity and at least integration in Lebesgue-Sense could still be done even if the domain is not a topological manifold. I am thinking of a definition like: Let $(M,T)$ be a topological space. Let $\mathcal{A}=\sigma(T)$ be the $\sigma$-algebra induced by the topology $T$, i.e. the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains $T$. Then $(M,\mathcal{A})$ is called a measurable manifold, iff $T$ is hausdorff and second-countable (is this necessary?) and $\forall p \in M$ there is a open (wrt $T$) nbhd $U$, and a measurable bijection $\varphi:U \to \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is to be understood with Lebesgue-$\sigma$-algebra. I'm just wondering, why I never came across the concept of a measurable manifold as generalization of a topological manifold. One possible explanation in my mind is, that such a manifold would not have a well-defined dimension anymore, as I believe that there are measurable bijections between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$.

The situation is as follows: They have a protein and measure some property three times (to eliminate measurement error). Then they mix the same batch of protein with some chemical and measure the same property again twice. In the end they want to know, if the measurements are different enough. (I know the number of measurements is low, but it is the maximum they can do). 2) If we assume, that the samples are independent I would choose Welch's t-test, because we cannot assume the same variance. However they say that, due to the fact that we measure the same batch of protein three times, and then two times with some chemical, the before and after measurements are related samples. But for related samples I only found paired t-tests, which cannot be used here, because there are no explicit pairs. The only thing that comes to my mind is to pair each measurement from each set. 3) How to measure statistically significant difference of a property, when we have 3 measurements of batch of protein before applying a chemical and 2 measurements after applying a chemical. Measurements are repeated to eliminate error in measurement device.","['statistics', 'biology', 'hypothesis-testing']"

2580859,Need a help in finding the inverse of an operator .,"The question and part of its answer is given as follows: 13. Let $K$ be an operator of a finite rank on a Hilbert space $H$. For $\varphi \in H$,
  $$ K\varphi = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \langle \varphi, \varphi_j\rangle\psi_j. $$
  Suppose $\psi_j \in \operatorname{sp}\{ \varphi_1, \cdots, \varphi_n\}^{\perp}$ for $j = 1, \cdots, n$. Prove that $\mathrm{I} + \alpha K$ is invertible for any $\alpha$ and find its inverse. Solution. Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$, $K'\varphi = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \langle \varphi, \varphi_j\rangle (-\alpha \psi_j)$. By Theorem 7.1,
  \begin{align*}
\text{$\mathrm{I} + \alpha K$ is invertible}
&\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\text{$\mathrm{I}-K'$ is invertible} \\
&\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\det(\delta_{ij}-\langle(-\alpha\psi_j),\varphi_i\rangle)_{i,j=1}^{n}\neq 0.
\end{align*}
  But
  $$\det(\delta_{ij}-\langle(-\alpha\psi_j),\varphi_i\rangle)_{i,j=1}^{n}
= \det(\delta_{ij}+\alpha\langle\psi_j,\varphi_i\rangle)_{i,j=1}^{n}
= 1
\neq 0$$
  (because $\psi_j \in \operatorname{sp}\{ \varphi_1, \cdots, \varphi_n\}^{\perp}$ for $j = 1, \cdots, n$). Thus $\mathrm{I}+\alpha K$ is invertible. A part of the theorem is given as follows: 7.1. Theorem. Suppose $K \in L(H)$ is of finite rank, say
  $$ Kx = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \langle x, \varphi_j\rangle\psi_j. $$
  The operator $I-K$ is invertible if and only if
  $$\det(\delta_{ij}-\langle\psi_j,\varphi_i\rangle)_{i,j=1}^{n} \neq 0. $$
  In this case, for every $y \in H$,
  $$ (I-K)^{-1}y = y - \frac{1}{\det(a_{ij})}\det\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} & \langle y, \varphi_1\rangle \\
