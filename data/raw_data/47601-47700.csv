479795,Upper semicontinuity of a probability measure,"Let $m$ be an atomless probability measure on $\mathbb{R}^m$. Consider $f: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $v \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $x \mapsto f(x,v)$ is continuous. Define the function $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow [0,1]$ as 
$$ F(x) := m\left( \{ w \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid f(x,w) \geq 0 \}\right). $$ I am wondering if $F$ is upper semicontinuous, i.e. for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } F(x_n ) \leq F(x) $. If not, I am looking for a counterexample. Also, I am wondering if $m$ being atomless is really needed. I started as follows. $\lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } m\left( \{ w \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid f(x_n,w)\geq 0 \}\right) = \lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } \int_{\mathbb{R}^m} \mathbb{1}_{ \{ w \mid f(x_n, w) \geq 0 \}}(w) m(dw) \leq^{ \text{Fatou} } \ \int_{\mathbb{R}^m} \lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } \mathbb{1}_{ \{ w \mid f(x_n, w) \geq 0 \} }(w) m(dw) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^m}  \mathbb{1}_{ \lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } \{ w \mid f(x_n, w)\geq 0 \} }(w) m(dw) $. Then I do not know if I can move $\lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x }$ ""inside the set"", namely getting $ \{ w \mid \lim \sup_{ x_n \rightarrow x } f( x_n,w ) \} $. Getting to $\int_{\mathbb{R}^m} \limsup_{x_n \rightarrow x} \mathbb{1}_{ \{w \mid f(x_n,w)\geq 0 \} }(w) m(dw) $, a way of thinking may be to define the sets $A_n := \{w \mid f(x_n,w) \geq 0 \}$ and claim that for all $w \in \mathbb{R}^m$ it holds $\limsup_{x_n \rightarrow x} \mathbb{1}_{A_n}(w) \leq \mathbb{1}_A(w)$.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'limits', 'analysis']"

With the choice axiom this is clear, because the union of $\aleph_0 \leq | \alpha|$ many sets of cardinality $|\alpha^n| =|\alpha |$, is again of cardinality $\leq | \alpha |$ (by a well-known theorem that uses the choice axiom), and clearly the set of all finite subsets of $\alpha$ can be injected into $\bigcup_{1 \leq n \in \omega} \alpha^n$. But is this result still true without the choice axiom? I've been trying to define a bijection explicitly (""coding"") but it doesn't seem to work out.

If $f,g:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are increasing and non-negative, show that the function $h(x,y)=f(x)g(y)$ is integrable over $[0,1]^2$. I'm using the Darboux definition of integration, so I want to prove that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a partition $P$ of $Q$ such that $U(f,P)-L(f,P)<\epsilon$. Equivalently, there exists a partition $P$ of $Q$ such that $$\left|\sum_Rv(R)(M_R(f)-m_R(f))\right|<\epsilon,$$ where $M_R(f)$ is the supremum of the values of $f$ inside the rectangle $R$, and $m_R(f)$ is the corresponding value for infimum. (Here, $R$ ranges over all subrectangles formed by the partition $P$.) Toward that end, I tried to take the partition $P$ to be $[0,\dfrac1n,\dfrac2n,\ldots,1]\times[0,\dfrac1n,\dfrac2n,\ldots,1]$. Since the function $h(x,y)$ is increasing in $x$ and $y$, the maximum of any square is attained at the top-right corner, and the minimum at the bottom-left corner. Therefore, $\left|\sum_Rv(R)(M_R(f)-m_R(f))\right|$ is equal to $$\dfrac{1}{n^2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(\dfrac in)g(1)+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(1)g(\dfrac in)-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(\dfrac in)g(0)-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(0)g(\dfrac in)\right)$$ I'm not sure if this is the right partition to take.

480042,Prove that the CDF of a random variable is always right-continuous,"Let $X$ be a random variable with cumulative distribution function $F_X$. It is a known fact that this function $F_X$ is right-continuous. But I'm having some trouble to prove this result. Below I'm sketching out what I have done so far to prove this and where exactly I'm having the difficulty. My attempt: To show that $F_X$ is right-continuous at a real number $y$, we need to prove that $$\lim_{x\to y^+}F_X(x)=F_X(y).$$ I will use the sequential approach to prove this. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence such that $x_n \to y$ and $x_n \geq y$ for every $n$. Define $A_n = (-\infty,x_n]$ for each $n$. Now from the sequence $(x_n)$ we can extract a monotonically decreasing subsequence, say $(x_{n_k})$. As the new subsequence is monotonically decreasing, it follows from our definition of $A_n$'s that for all $k$ in $\mathbb{N}$, $A_{n_{k+1}} \subseteq A_{n_k}$. So $X^{-1}(A_{n_{k+1}}) \subseteq X^{-1}(A_{n_k})$ and hence $$F_X(x_{n_{k+1}}) = P(X\leq x_{n_{k+1}}) = P(X^{-1}(A_{n_{k+1}})) \leq P(X^{-1}(A_{n_{k}})) = P(X\leq x_{n_{k}}) = F_X(x_{n_{k}}).$$ Now since $(X^{-1}(A_{n_k}))_k$ is a nested sequence of events, we know $$\lim_{k\to\infty}P(X^{-1}(A_{n_k})) = P(\cap_{k=1}^{\infty}(X^{-1}(A_{n_k}))) = P(X^{-1}(\cap_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{n_k})) = P(X^{-1}(-\infty,y]).$$ Therefore, $$\lim_{k\to\infty}F_X(x_{n_k}) = P(X\leq y) = F_X(y).$$ This shows that the sequence $(F_X(x_{n_k}))_k$ converges to $F_X(y)$. But it does not prove $F_X(x_n) \to F_X(y)$ as $n\to \infty$, which is required to show that $F_X$ is right-continuous. I'm completely stuck at this point and can't get any idea how to go from the particular subsequence $(F_X(x_{n_k}))_k$ to the general sequence $(F_X(x_n))_n$ or how to prove this result using the sequential approach and without having to extract a monotone decreasing subsequence from a given sequence. I'll appreciate any help or suggestion. Thanks and regards.","['probability-theory', 'random-variables']"
480049,Is the Riemann Integral good for anything?,"Math people: I think it is a good idea to teach beginning calculus students the Riemann Integral (I refer to what calculus books call the ""Riemann Integral"" and ignore any controversy about whether it should be called the Darboux integral, etc.), since it gives a rigorous definition to the idea of ""area under a curve"" and you don't need measure theory to define it.

So $\mathbf{v} = v\hat{\mathbf{u}}\iff \dot{\hat{\mathbf{u}}} = \frac{1}{v}\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$. Then $\frac{\dot{\hat{\mathbf{{u}}}}}{\dot{s}} = \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$. I know that

Proof: Let $G$ be generated by $x$ (Let $G=\langle x \rangle$ for some $x$ in $G$ .) We wish to show that there exists an $x'$ in $G'$ such that $G'=\langle x' \rangle$ . First, we will show that for all $x^n$ in $G$ , $f(x^n)=f^n(x)$ . We proceed by induction. Base case: $n=1$ . $f(x*e_G)=f(x)f(e_G)=f(x)$ . Now, assume that $f(x^k)=f^k(x)$ for some arbitrary positive integer k. We show that $f(x^{k+1})=f^{k+1}(x)$ . Observe that $f(x^{k+1})=f(x^kx)=f(x^k)f(x)=f^k(x)f(x)=f^{k+1}(x).$ Next we will show that for all $x^{-n}$ in $G$ , $f(x^{-n})=f^{-n}(x)$ . We proceed by induction. Base case: $n=-1$ . $f(x^{-1}*e_G)=f(x^{-1})f(e_G)=f(x)$ . Now, assume that $f(x^{-k})=f^{-k}(x)$ for some arbitrary positive integer k. We show that $f(x^{-k-1})=f^{-k-1}(x)$ . Observe that $f(x^{-k-1})=f(x^{-k}x)=f(x^{-k})f(x)=f^{-k}(x)f(x)=f^{-k-1}(x).$ Because $f$ is onto, $Im(f)=G'$ and therefore $Im(f)=(...,f^{-2}(x),f^{-1}(x),e_G,f(x),f^2(x),...)=G'$ . Thus, there exists an $x'$ in $G'$ such that $G'=\langle x' \rangle$ and the proof is complete by the principle of mathematical induction. Q.E.D. I have a feeling the proof shouldn't be this long.

480275,Problem 4-25 from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds,"I am reading through Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds and have come across a technicality in one of the problems that is annoying me.

If $\omega$ is a $k$-form, show that
  $$
\int_c \omega = \int_{c\circ p} \omega.
$$ I think Spivak intended this to be a straightforward exercise in the use of the change of variables theorem (his Theorem 3-13, which I copy below, making the change that Problem 3-39 allows, namely removing the assumption that $\det g'(x)\neq 0$). 3-13 Theorem. Let $A\subset\mathbf{R}^n$ be an open set and $p:A\to\mathbf{R}^n$ a 1-1, continuously differentiable function. If $f:p(A)\to\mathbf{R}$ is integrable, then
  $$
\int_{p(A)} f = \int_A (f\circ p)\lvert\det p'\rvert.
$$ Indeed if we unwind the definitions of integrating forms over cubes, Problem 4-25 is solved as long as we can say that
$$
\int_{[0,1]^k} (f\circ p)\lvert \det p' \rvert = \int_{[0,1]^k} f.
$$
for a (say smooth) function $f:[0,1]^k\to\mathbf{R}$. There's one problem: $[0,1]^k$ is not open so I can't apply the theorem above directly. What I would like to do is replace the integrals over $[0,1]^k$ by integrals over $(0,1)^k$ but I don't really see how this will work. I don't know that the corresponding integrals would then be equal. I don't know that $p$ restricts to a bijection from $(0,1)^k$ to $(0,1)^k$. I don't know that $p((0,1)^k)$ is open because I can't use the inverse function theorem. Any way I try to approach this I seem to run into technical problems. I am happy to assume that everything is smooth.

Assuming $G$ is simple, $|G|=24$. as $24=2^3.3$ No. of sylow 3 subgroups $1+3k$ divides $8$.thus, no of sylow $3$ subgroups has to be $4$. Suppose $n_2=3$ each sylow 3 subgroup has 2 non identity elements totally 8 non identity elements. each sylow 2 subgrousp has 7 non identity elements as we can not assume sylow 2 subgroups intersection is non trivial,$\textbf{INCOMPLETE}$ Only numbers we are left with are $\{40,48,54,56,60,72,80,84,88,90,96\}$ $40=2^3.5$ no.of sylow 5 dubgroups $1+5k$ divides $8$ Thus,sylow 5 sbgroup is unique and hence group is not simple.

Only numbers we are left with are $\{56,60,72,80,84,88,90,96\}$ $\textbf{EDIT}$ : Consider group $G$ of order $56$, for this we have $56=2^3.7$.
Assuming this being simple group we would end up with the case that $n_2=7,n_7=8$.
$n_p$ denotes no. of sylow p subgroups.
each sylow $7$ subgroup has $6$ non identity elements, totally there are $8\times 6=48$ non identity elements in all sylow $7$ subgroups.\
each sylow $2$ subgroup has $7$ non identity elements. As there is a possibility that intersection of two sylow $2$ subgroups to be non trivial, there would be one more (non identity) element different from these seven non identity elements, adding upto 8 non identity elements, with $1$ identity element and adding upto $1+8+48=57$ ($48$ elements from sylow $7$ subgroups) contradicting the cardinality of order of group $|G|=56$.
Thus, either $n_2=1$ or $n_7=1$.Thus, there exists a unique sylow $2$ subgroup or a unique sylow $7$ subgroup.Thus,$G$ is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\{60,72,80,84,88,90,96\}$ $80=2^4.5$ Possibilities for $n_2$ are $1,5$ possibilities for $n_5$ are $1,16$. Suppose 
Suppose $n_2=5$ and $n_5=16$, then $P_5$ contributes $64$ elements and atleast $16$ non identity elements from $P_2$ adding up to $80$ excluding identity. Thus G is not simple Only numbers we are left with are $\{60,72,84,88,90,96\}$ $84=2^2.3.7$ with out much difficulty, one can see $n_7=1$ and thus, G is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\{60,72,88,90,96\}$ $88=2^3.11$ with out much difficulty, one can see that $n_{11}=1$ thus G is simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\{60,72,90,96\}$ I somehow managed to show groups of order $72,90,96$ are not simple. (My hands are paining I can not write more than this :D) So, I am left with group of order $60$ and we have $A_5$ with $|A_5|=60$ and $G\cong A_5$ I would be thankful if someone can check whether this is clear (or) not (even with any typos) and If possible give a hint for a simple way to arrive at required result. Thank You. P.S : To be frank, I have no idea how to solve this before writing this. I thought i would say at-least i know cyclic groups (prime order) are not simple and leave the rest to the other users and then I realized $p^2$ are not simple and so on tried eliminating one by one. at the time i came to the case of $72,90,96$ I got fed up ad blindly decided to assume they are simple (:P). I would write about that cases in a while in detail. P.S $2$ : Could any one please help me in concluding a group of order 24 being simple. I have edited a blunder in my argument.

Then it exists a $r>0$ so that $\lvert f(z)\rvert \leq\lvert f(z_0)\rvert~\forall~z\in B(r,z_0)$. (*) The mean value property says
$$
f(z_0)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(z_0+re^{it})\, dt,

so it is, because of (*),
$$
\lvert f(z_0)\rvert\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\lvert f(z_0+re^{it})\rvert\, dt\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\lvert f(z_0)\rvert\, dt=\lvert f(z_0)\rvert

$$(8-y-z)^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8$$ Using Wolfram Alpha I expanded this equation and tried to factorize it so finally I got: $$(z-8)(y^2 + y(z-8) - 8z) = 168$$ $z \in \mathbb{Z}$, which implies $z-8$ is an integer implying that the second term is also an integer. 168 has 16 positive divisors and 16 negative, which means there are 32 distinct cases to be looked, which is a painful work and made me abandon this method in search of a better and easier method.

$$s_2 - 64 + 2c = 0 \implies c = \frac{64 - s_2}{2}$$ $$s_3 + bs_2 + cs_1 + 3d = 0$$

Now this definition still makes sense without the condition that $T$ is totally ordered. However, there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in this generalization. Perhaps this is evidence that we're not generalizing correctly. One thing we might try is to replace ""singleton"" with ""antichain."" So the definition becomes: The order topology on a partially ordered set $P$ is the coarsest
  topology such that every subset of $P$ that can be expressed as the
  upward or downward closure of an antichain is closed. This reduces to the usual definition under the assumption that $P$ is totally ordered. What is currently known about this topology, and where can I learn more?","['general-topology', 'reference-request', 'order-theory']"

480728,Am I allowed to use distributive law for infinitely many sets?,"Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A collection $S$ of subsets of $X$ is 
  called a semiring if it satisfies the following properties: The empty set belongs to S; that is $\emptyset \in S$. If $A,B \in S$; then $A \cap B \in S$; that is, $S$ is closed under finite intersections. The set difference of any two sets of $S$ can be written as a finite union of 
  pair-wise disjoint members of $S$. That is, for every $A, B \in S$; there exist
  $C_1, ...,C_n \in S$ (depending on $A$ and $B$) such that $A\setminus B = \cup _{i=1}^n C_i$ and $C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset$ if $i\ne j$. Now, let $S$ be a semiring of subsets of $X$. A subset $A$ of $X$ is called a $\sigma$-set with respect to $S$ (or simply a $\sigma$-set) if there exists a disjoint sequence $\{A_n\}$ of 
$S$ such that $A = \cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$. One can show easily that for every sequence $\{A_n\}$ of $S$, the set $A = \cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$ is a $\sigma$-set. I would like to prove that finite intersections of $\sigma$-sets is a $\sigma$-set. For this purpose, suppose $A ,B$ are $\sigma$-sets then $A = \cup_{i=1}^\infty C_i$ , $B = \cup_{j=1}^\infty D_j$. $$A\cap B=(\cup_{i=1}^\infty C_i)\cap (\cup_{j=1}^\infty D_j)$$ In this step I don't know am I allowed to use distributive law for infinitely many sets? Or the law holds only for finitely many sets? If it holds only for finitely many sets how do I prove that finite intersections of $\sigma$-sets is a $\sigma$-set?

480781,Function integrable over the interior but not over the set,"Let $S$ be a bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$; let $f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded continuous function; let $A$ be the interior of $S$. Give an example where $\int_Af$ exists and $\int_Sf$ does not. There's a theorem that says if $\int_Sf$ does not exist, then for a set $E$ of measure nonzero of points $x_0$ on the boundary of $S$, the condition $\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x)=0$ fails to hold. So we must select $S$ at least to meet that condition. In particular, the boundary must have measure nonzero. But whenever we pick a connected region in the plane, for example, the boundary has measure zero. So I'm not sure which set $S$ to pick here.","['integration', 'real-analysis']"
480785,Some (in)equalities about binary relations,"Let $\Phi\subseteq (A\times A)\times(A\times A)$, $F_0,F_1\subseteq A\times A$ (for some set $A$) be binary relations.

Do inequalities $\pi_0\circ\Phi \subseteq F_0\circ\pi_0$ and $\pi_1\circ\Phi \subseteq F_1\circ\pi_1$ imply existence of a binary relation $\Psi\supseteq\Phi$ (we also require $\Psi\subseteq (A\times A)\times(A\times A)$) such that $\pi_0\circ\Psi = F_0\circ\pi_0$ and $\pi_1\circ\Psi = F_1\circ\pi_1$? If yes, is this $\Psi$ unique?

f(x)=c~\forall~x\in B(r,x_0).

480837,Is the finite dimension required in this proof?,"Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over a field $K$. If a linear map $L:V \rightarrow W$ is surjective then its dual is injective.
If $V$ and $W$ are finite dimensional then the converse holds, i.e.  $L^*:W^* \rightarrow V^*$ injective implies $L$ surjective. I have proved both statements but I don't see where I used the finite dimensional requirement for the second. Here is my proof: Assume $L$ is not surjective, say the element $e_i$ of the basis of $W$ is not in the image of $L$.  Take its corresponding dual $\alpha_i \in W^*$, then $L^*(\alpha_i)=\alpha_i \circ L =0$ so the kernel of $L^*$ is not 0 and therefore $L^*$ is not injective.",['linear-algebra']
480841,"In how many ways can three numbers be selected from the numbers $1,2,\dots,300$ such that their sum is divisible by $3$?","Can someone check which logic is finally correct?: In how many ways can three numbers be selected from the numbers $1,2,\dots,300$ such that their sum is divisible by $3$? I found different answers about the exact question but everyone states something different. Dividing $\{1, \dots , 300\}$ into three groups $(A,B,C)$ where each one of them has $100$ numbers in it and ${}\bmod 3$ results in $0$ or $1$ or $2$ seems correct as a first step. Then if we want the sum of the three numbers to be divisible by $3$ we should take cases: All of them belong to one of the groups: $ {{100}\choose{3}} + {{100}\choose{3}} + {{100}\choose{3}} $ We take one from each group: $ {{100}\choose{1}} × {{100}\choose{1}} × {{100}\choose{1}} $ The answer ends there by adding the above numbers (because one of them can happen). But what about combinations such as:
Taking one number from the group that gives remainder $1$ and two numbers from the group that gives remainder $2$??","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
