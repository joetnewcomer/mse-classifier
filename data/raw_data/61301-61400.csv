690122,Sign of Laplacian at critical points of $\mathbb R^n$,"Suppose we are in $\mathbb R^n$. What can we say about the sign of $\Delta u(\vec x)$ if u($\vec x$) has a local max/min at $\vec x$? I've tried looking at the reverse of the second partial derivative test and it seems to suggest that $\Delta u(\vec x) \leq 0$ if $\vec x$ is a min and $\Delta u(\vec x) \geq 0$ if $\vec x$ is a max. However, I'm not convinced of this result. Can somebody point me towards a statement (theorem, etc.) involving the above.

690136,Solving Recurrences,"My class and I were introduced to recurrences last week, and we took up this example (see link) in class. Unfortunately I find it really tricky still, and I apologize in advance if this question is...pathetic(?) From the steps shown class, solving it starts with finding a pattern: T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 =2[2T(n-2) + 1] + 1 =4[2T(n-3) + 1] + 3 =8[2T(n-4) + 1] + 7 I (believe I) understand why 2T(n-1) + 1 is in the square brackets. But I have no idea where the 2, 4, 8 (in the beginning of each) comes from, as with the 1, 3, 7 and the ends.

690140,Seasonal adjustment and Fourier analysis,"I've been reading up on seasonal adjustment (removing ""seasonal"" periodic components from a time series) recently and although I see a lot of fancy work around ARIMA models and fancy ways to detect the seasonality, I see comparatively little work on moving to the frequency domain and looking at series with Fourier transforms or wavelets or anything along those lines. There are some older papers on the topic but it looks like the mainstream approaches don't do anything directly in that space. Does anyone know why? Does naively applying the Fourier transform, removing undesired periodic components, and inverting it lead to bad results? Is there a survey of seasonal adjustment from the perspective of ""you might think to use XYZ, but this is why that doesn't work and how these mainstream techniques improve on that""?","['statistics', 'fourier-analysis', 'time-series']"
690153,Approximating Trig Functions with Polynomials,"I was thinking about the graphs of different trig functions and noticed that most of them are of a similar shape to some different types of polynomials. For example: Higher degree polynomials create a wave like sin or cos $x^3$ looks like one repetition of tan, and could be flipped and shifted to look like cot Each repetition of sec and csc looks like two quadratic parabolas While obviously the polynomials aren't going to be an exact approximation, are there a set of coefficients that create a reasonably close (to a few decimal places) approximation of one period of the trig functions?

It is well-known that this result holds if $(X,d)$ is a metric space ( proof ) $X$ is locally compact with a countable basis (because then it is metrizable).

690238,Groups acting on schemes: the quotient scheme doesn't always exist.,"Preliminary notion: Consider the action of a group $G$ on an object $X$ of some category $\mathcal C$. We have a group homomorphism $\rho:G\longrightarrow\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ which sends $g$ in $\rho_g$. The quotient space is an object $Y$ of $\mathcal C$ with a morphism $p:X\longrightarrow Y$ which satisfies the following universal property: For every $g\in G$ $p\circ\rho_g=p$ and moreover if $f:X\longrightarrow Z$ is another morphism with  this property then there exists a unique morphism $\theta:Y\longrightarrow Z$ such that $f=\theta\circ p$. Now it is not difficoult to prove (Q.Liu's book exercise 2.14) that given a locally ringed space $(X,\mathcal O_X)$, one can define the quotient locally ringed  space $(Y=X/G,\mathcal O_Y)$. In the exercise 3.21 Liu says that for schemes the quotient space is not always well defined  (for example it exists when $G$ is finite, the action is free and we are talking about affine schemes). I don't understand where is the obstruction: a scheme is "" a particular"" locally ringed space because it  has a particular decomposition in affine schemes; why this ""tiny"" difference implies the non-existence of the quotient space? Edit: Liu also says that sometimes the quotient scheme exists but it is not equal to the quotient space as locally ringed space. This sentece astonished me.

690259,Homogeneous polynomials between vector spaces,"Consider $\mathbb{C}$ vector space $V$ = span$(e_1,\cdots,e_n)$. Consider the following algebra embedding $$ \mathbb{C}[X_1,\cdots,X_n]\hookrightarrow F(V,\mathbb{C})$$ where $f\mapsto(\sum_i a_i e_i\mapsto f(a_1,\cdots,a_n))$. Denote the image as $O(V)$, call its elements polynomials on $V$. Define a polynomial to be homogeneous of degree $p$ if $f(tv) = t^p f(v)$ for all $v\in V$ and $t\in\mathbb{C}$. I'm thinking about a different way of characterizing homogenous polynomials of degree $p$.
Consider the map $i_p:V\to S^p(V)$ sending $v\mapsto \underbrace{v\otimes\cdots\otimes v}_{p}$, if we have any linear map $g:S^p(V)\to \mathbb{C}$, then I want to show 1) $g\circ i_p$ is indeed in $O(V)$ (and clearly homogeneous of degree p) 2) Every homogeneous polynomial can be obtained this way. Is the above true, and how to show that? If indeed true, then I can generalize and define homogeneous polynomials of degree p from $V$ to a vector space $W$ using the second way. Define a function $f$ to be polynomial of degree $p$ from $V$ to $W$ if there is linear map $g:S^p(V)\to W$ such that $f = g\circ i_p$. Is this the same as all function from $V$ to $W$ such that $f(tv) = t^pf(v)$ for all $v\in V$ and $t\in\mathbb{C}$?

690274,Density of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble,"I'm trying to learn a bit about Gaussian matrix ensembles, and am having some trouble making the following connection. Sorry if I'm being a bit obtuse.

690326,Uniform boundedness principle for norm convergence,"This is from Tao's book; Let $X$ be Banach space, let Y be normed vector space, and let $(T_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a family of continuous linear operators $T_n : X \to Y$. Then following is equivalent. (i) (Pointwise convergence) For every $x \in X$. $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$. (ii) (Pointwise convergence to a continuous limit) There exists a continuous linear map $T:X \to Y$ such that for every $x\in X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ to $T(x)$ as $n\to\infty$. (iii) (Uniform boundedness + dense subclass convergence) The operator norms $\{||T_n|| : n = 1, 2, . . .\}$ are bounded, and for a dense set of $x$ in $X$, $T_n(x)$ converges strongly in $Y$ as $n \to \infty$ What I have trouble is $(i) \to (iii)$ and $(iii) \to (ii)$. My proof on $(i) \to (iii)$ is like below; second statement of $(iii)$ is easy so it suffices to prove only boundedness of the set of operator norms. Since convergent sequence is bounded, $\{ T_n(x)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is clearly bounded sequence. Hence there is some $N $ such that $||T_n(x)|| < N$. Since $T_n$ is linear, $||T_n(x)|| = ||T_n ||_{\mathrm{op}}||x|| < N$, and since $x$ is fixed, $||T_n||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is bounded. Is this argument reasonable? In the Tao's note, he mention Baire category theorem to prove this.But I don't know how to prove this using Baire category theorem directly. For second question, $(iii) \to (ii)$, I have an idea that construct $T:X \to Y$ such that $T(x) =\lim_{n \to \infty} T_n(x)$ and $T(0)=0$. But I know that $T$ is linear and continuous on dense set, but don't know how to extend it to limit point of $X$. Could you give me some hint?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
690335,"Prove that: $\lfloor n^{1/2}\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n^{1/n}\rfloor=\lfloor \log_2n\rfloor +\cdots+\lfloor \log_nn \rfloor$, for $n > 1$","Prove that: $\lfloor n^{1/2}\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n^{1/n}\rfloor=\lfloor \log_2n\rfloor +\cdots+\lfloor \log_nn \rfloor$, for $n > 1,\, n\in \mathbb{N}$ For example. For $n=2$, we have
$\lfloor 2^{1/2} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.414 \rfloor = 1$ whereas 
$\lfloor \log_2(2) \rfloor = 1$
while for $n=3$, we have
$$\lfloor 3^{1/2} \rfloor + \lfloor 3^{1/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.732 \rfloor + \lfloor 1.442 \rfloor = 2= \lfloor 1.585 \rfloor + \lfloor 1 \rfloor=\lfloor \log_2(3) \rfloor + \lfloor \log_3(3) \rfloor .$$ I was thinking of using induction.
So since $n=2$ is true, now assume for all $n$, this identity is true, we would like to prove that $n+1$ is true. Then $$\lfloor n^{1/2} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor + ... + \lfloor n^{1/n} \rfloor + \lfloor (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \rfloor,$$
where $(n+1)^{1/(n+1)} > 1$ for all $n>1$ but it's strictly decreasing above 1 so $\lfloor (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \rfloor = 1$ $\implies \lfloor n^{1/2} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor +\cdots+ \lfloor n^{1/n} \rfloor + \lfloor (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \rfloor
= \lfloor n^{1/2} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor +\cdots+ \lfloor n^{1/n} \rfloor + 1 $ $= \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + \lfloor \log_3(n) \rfloor + \cdots+ \lfloor \log_n(n) \rfloor + \lfloor \log_{n+1}(n+1) \rfloor$ since, $\log_{n+1}(n+1) = 1$ for all $n$. My question is: How do we know that $(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}$ will never go below $1$? i.e., How can we prove that this function $f(x) = (x+1)^{1/(x+1)}$ is always bounded below by $1$ for $x>1$? (First, When $x=0$, $f(0)=1$, then looking at it's derivative, one can see that it's strictly increasing for $x$ between $(0,1)$ and decreasing for all $x>1$).","['inequality', 'calculus', 'rational-functions', 'logarithms', 'ceiling-and-floor-functions']"

690407,Questions about weak derivatives,"There are two definitions of generalized differentiation that seem relevant to the context of PDEs. (That is we generalize what objects can be differentiated but we stay in Euclidean space.  There are also other types of generalizations that change the space like Frechet or Gateaux derivatives in Banach spaces.) One is that we take any distribution (continuous linear functional on $C^\infty_{com}$ with the topology of convergence of all derivatives in sup norm) and we precompose it with differentiation times a negative sign.  There is no question of existence here. The other is called the ""weak derivative"" and it is supposed to be applied only to locally integrable Borel measurable functions, but again on some open subset of Euclidean space.  Then, the weak derivative may or may not exist, and when it does the definition is that it is locally integrable and must satisfy the integration by parts relation against smooth compactly supported test functions. I gather that the first generalization is a generalization even of the second one, as long as one identifies locally integrable functions with their integration distributions.  So first extends second extends ordinary differentiation.  My questions are as follows, if that is correct: Which distributions have antiderivatives?  Which locally integrable functions have weak antiderivatives?  In the weak case, it seems like this has to do with absolute continuity? It is easy for me to formalize a statement that says that derivatives depend on only local information for weak derivatives.  But is there something like this for distributional derivatives?  What would it mean to look locally at a distribution? For weak derivatives only, which may not exist, what are some examples of when an $\alpha$th derivative exists, but there exists a $\beta\le \alpha$ for which the $\beta$th weak derivative does not exist?  What if instead $\beta\ge \alpha$, which may be nontrivial since I don't think antiderivatives come for free? Is there a heuristic, much like there was for ordinary derivatives, that allows me to tell if the weak derivative will exist, and perhaps even to quickly compute the answer?  Right now, all I can see is that if the function is piecewise smooth, then if a weak derivative exists, then you know all the behavior except at the joining points, and those don't matter since the weak derivative is only defined up to a.e.  So then if you can come up with a good reason why this guess doesn't actually work, then no other candidate could possibly work either.

690491,Pigeonhole Principle to Prove a Hamiltonian Graph,"I am trying to figure out if a graph can be assumed Hamiltonian or not, or if it's indeterminable with minimal information: A graph has 17 vertices and 129 edges.

Doesn't Dirac's theorem state that the vertices degree must ALL be greater than or equal to n/2, in this case, 8.5, or maybe 9?

690507,mathematics of chemical stoichiometry,"I would like to better understand the mathematical description of chemical stoichiometry and thermodynamic chemical equilibrium. This problem has many features and I know my description might be too vague. There are generally two approaches to the problem, the constrained optimization problem (e.g. minimization of gibb's energy with mass balance constraints) or using the $\Delta G_{rx}=-RTln(K_{eq})$ method based upon the equilibrium constant for a set of linearly independent stoichiometric equations. The latter method can only be applied assuming the initial species assumed present are non-negative because having a negative or zero value for a species concentration would violate the functional form of the Keq method. $N = [\nu_{ij}]$, where $\nu_{ij}$ are the stoichiometric coefficents of the jth species in the ith equation. $K_{eq,i}=\prod activity_j^{\nu_{ij}}$ for each stoichiometric equation $i$ To address the non-negativity constraint, a sort of model reduction can be applied by generating the power set of the set of possible chemical species under consideration. The equilibrium constant method can be applied to each element of the power set assuming non-negativity. This would require that the element of the power set would correctly represent the actual equilbrium by checking some auxiliary condition such as the activity of the chemical species according to thermodynamic equilibrium of ideal substance. Suppose the (very simple) chemical equations that can represent chemical reactions (not chemical mechanisms) indicated by the following construct: General:
$(\{Chemical Species\},\{Chemical Elements\})$ Example:
$(\{a(c),ab_2(g),b_2(g)\},\{a,b\})$ There now needs to be a choice of ordering for the set of Chemical Species and for the set of Chemical Elements. One choice is to just use the sequence suggested by the listing of elements in the each set (not sure how to mathematically describe this, but i have the feeling it is something related to an indexed set, but dont understand how the ordering arises from a set if a set isn't supposed to have ordering). In most literature, the prior construct is a ordered pair of 'ordered sets' and is called a chemical system. Chemical Species: $a(c) = 1*a$ $ab_2(g) = 1*a + 2*b$ $b_2(g) = 2*b$ One can construct each vector representations of the chemical species from the chemical elements once the ordering is chosen. Chemical Elements:
$a=(1,0),b=(0,1)$ And with a chosen ordering of the chemical species the following element abundance matrix can be generated (i.e. a mapping from chemical species quantities to elemental quantities):
$
A = \bordermatrix{~ & a(c) & ab_2(g) & b_2(g) \cr
              a & 1 & 1 & 0\cr
              b & 0 & 2 & 2\cr} 
$
$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 2 & 2\end{pmatrix}
$ The coefficents to the stoichiometric equation can be generated by taking finding the null space (matrix $N$ of the matrix $A$. Once the stoichiometric matrix $N$ is found, it can be put in a 'canonical form' by the operations: $(RREF(N^T))^T$
$ This produces $N=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ Where, $AN=0$. (This is essentially the condition of mass balance due to reaction, but the relation doesn't constrain the quantities being balanced to be positive) The process of finding the stoichiometric equations for a given set of chemical species and  set of chemical elements can be constructed in this manner. But the process involved making certain decisions, such as choosing an ordering of the chemical species from the set of allowed species. If a different ordering is chosen for the chemical species, it is possible to represent the $A' = \bordermatrix{~ & ab_2(g) & a(c) & b_2(g) \cr
              a & 1 & 1 & 0\cr
              b & 2 & 0 & 2\cr}
$ $
A' = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0\\
2 & 0 & 2\end{pmatrix}
$ This produces $N'=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -1 \\ -1\end{bmatrix}$ for the 'canonical form' of the stoichiometric matrix. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, this essentially changes what one would consider the 'products' compared to the 'reactants' in a chemical reaction. But for equilibrium this doesn't really matter, because the equilibrium is based upon the quantity of the chemical elements and not the starting quantity of chemical species (the starting quantity of chemical species is only indicative of the starting elemental species quantities). The form of the $\Delta(G_{rx})$ and $K_{eq}$ will change according to whatever ordering is chosen. I often chose specific orderings to force the exponents in the $K_{eq}$ expressions to be $1$ for chemical species listed first in the elemental abundance matrix. Additionally, there is the problem of assuming that one of the assumed chemical species present before calculating equilibrium might be a limiting reagant (i.e. a solid reacting to form gas and is no longer present). This wouldn't be properly accounted for in the $K_{eq}$ method due to the condition of non-negative. Therefore, one can consider the original construct to be: $(\{ab_2(g),b_2(g)\},\{a,b\})$ $
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\
 2 & 2\end{pmatrix}
$ The stoichiometric matrix $N$ is the zero (trivial) subspace, $A$ is of rank 2. Admittedly, The mass balance would be sufficient constraints to this system without needing to address the functional form of the thermodynamic constraints; most problems are much harder! There is also a thermodynamic condition that would need to be checked (such as activity of a condensed species) to confirm that the assumed chemical species present are actually present or not. To Conclude, I have already identified in literature how to generate the stoichiometric equations for a given collection of chemical species and chemical elements. The stoichiometric coefficents are used in thermodynamic theory to calculate equilibrium using certain procedures. However the change of ordering of the matrix columns of $A$ changes the coefficents represented by $N$ and the changes the functional form of the $K_{eq}$ problem. What is the proper mathematical description needed to talk about how changing the ordering of $A$ influences the other constructs. The non-negativity constraint can be realized by taking subsets of the chemical species assumed to be in some parent set with an additional check that the exclusion was valid (thermodynamic check on species activity). In the most extreme case it would be necessary to have $(# of species)!-1$ different cases, that is all elements of the power set of chemical species other than the null element. (That is the maximal number of cases, almost never realized because if the chemical elements are present then there must be some chemical species that are comprised of them.) How can I discuss the 'model reduction' of choosing an element of the power set of initial chemical species to calculate thermodynamic equilibrium. Just like the re-ordering of the elemental abundance matrix, the functional form of the thermodynamic constraints is affected by the choice of starting species. I have already solved my problem and can calculate thermodynamic equilbrium, I just dont know how to talk about it and identify when two of the mathematical constructs generated are actually the same or how to relate the sub-cases to the initial problem. I know this relates to convex optimization type problems, but it has a feel of representation of groups.

690592,Using Lagrange multipliers to solve for minimum,"I am having troubles with one part of this homework problem.  Hopefully somebody can help me out: Find the minimum and maximum values of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$  subject to the given constraint $x^4+y^4=18$. Using Lagrange multipliers, I can easily solve for the maximum: $f_x(x,y)=2x$ and $f_y(x,y)=2y$. If we call the second equation $g$, then:
$g_x=4x^3$ and $g_y=4y^3$. Then we apply the Lagrange multiplier: $2x=\lambda 4x^3$ and $2y = \lambda 4y^3$ By solving for $x$ and $y$ and plugging in to $g$, we get $\lambda=1/\sqrt{36}=\pm1/6$. To find the maximum, I will use the positive $1/6$, and solve for $x^2=3$ and $y^2=3$, resulting in a maximum of $6$, which the system spits out as correct. For a minimum, I originally thought $0$ because $x^2$ and $y^2$ must be positive numbers, but that is not correct.  Then I noticed that since $x^2=1/(2\lambda)$, and $y$ also, then when $\lambda$ is negative that would be the minimum, resulting in $-6$, which is also not correct.

$$

You can check for oscillations if there are any purely imaginary eigenvalues of $A$. The author in the book I'm reading then introduces the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for detecting stability and oscillations of the system. This seems to be a more efficient computational short-cut than calculating eigenvalues. What are the advantages of using Routh-Hurwitz criteria for stability and oscillations, if you already have the eigenvalues? For instance, will it be useful when I start to study nonlinear dynamics? Is there some additional application that I am completely missing, that I would miss out on by focusing on eigenvalues? Wikipedia entry on RH stability analysis has stuff about control systems, and ends up with a lot of material in the s-domain (Laplace transforms), but for my applications I will be staying in the time-domain for the most part, and just focusing fairly narrowly on stability and oscillations in linear (or linearized) systems.

Each subgroup must have atleast $1$ non identity element so there are $3$ non identity elements adding up identity element i would get $4$ elements. It would be extra ordinary if my choice of group is just of $4$ elements.

\mathbf{X}_{11} \sim \frac{\mathbf{\Psi}_{11}^{(\nu-1)/2}}{2^{\frac{\nu-1}{2}}\Gamma_1(\frac{\nu-1}{2})}\mathbf{X}_{11}^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}{\mathbf{\Psi}_{11} \mathbf{X}_{11}^{-1}}}
$$
whereas the inverse-gamma distribution for $\mathbf{X}_{11}$ with the corresponding parameters is
$$
\mathbf{X}_{11} \sim \frac{\mathbf{\Psi}_{11}^{\nu/2}}{2^{\frac{\nu}{2}}\Gamma_1(\frac{\nu}{2})}\mathbf{X}_{11}^{-\frac{\nu+2}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}{\mathbf{\Psi}_{11} \mathbf{X}_{11}^{-1}}}.
$$ It seems to me that when you marginalize the 2x2 expression over all elements that are not $\mathbf{X}_{11}$, you should end up with a distribution that 'tells the same story': i.e., marginalizing over a parameter essentially means that we assume no knowledge of it - it might as well not exist. And that is the same assumption that gives rise to the inverse-gamma distribution, to my mind. So why do the two distributions not end up the same?","['statistics', 'bayesian', 'statistical-inference']"

Let $u(z)$ be the harmonic function on $\Omega$ such that $u(z)=0$ on $C_1$ and u(z)=1 on $C_2$, and let $v(z)$ be a locally defined harmonic conjugate of $u(z)$. Prove that there exists a constant $\lambda>0$ such that $F(z)=e^{\lambda(u(z)+iv(z))}$ is single-valued, and that $F(z)$ maps $\Omega$ conformally to the annulus $\{z \in \Bbb C:1<|z|<e^\lambda\}$. I have a hint for the problem to first assume without loss in generality that $C_1$ is the unit circle, and $C_2$ is some simple closed analytic curve in $\{z\in \Bbb C:|z|>1\}$. I do understand this part, since we can use the Riemann mapping theorem on the complement of the bounded component of $\Omega^c$. Next, the hint says that $v(z)$ is strictly increasing on $C_1$, and that we should choose $\lambda$ such that the increase of $\lambda v(z)$ around $C_1$ is $2\pi$. I don't see why this is true. Even if I assume this part, I don't see how that shows $F(z)$ is single-valued. Perhaps it would be better to assume $C_1$ and $C_2$ are both circles and use the ides presented in this problem . However, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that. To show that $F(z)$ maps $\Omega$ conformally into an annulus, I believe Ahlfors does this in theorem 10 on page 255 of his complex analysis book.

What I have tried so far: We have $$a_1^2 + 2a_1 a_2 + a_2^2 \in Q_{2i} \text{ iff } (a_1^2 + 2a_1 a_2 + a_2^2)^{\deg f}/f^{2i} \in P_0.$$ I have tried expanding this using the binomial formula, but this doesn't get me anywhere (at least not at the moment) as I would like each term to be in $P_0$, however I can't see why this should be the case for any term except the first and last (i.e. the completely obvious ones). I am hoping for a very generous hint or even just a complete solution. By the way this is not homework, or an assignment or anything like that, this is just me trying to get a better understanding of Algebraic Geometry by working through the exercises in Vakil's notes, as I find this very enlightening (both when it comes to rigour and intuition). Thanks in advance. Added for the sake of self-containment: In this exercise we are going to show that if $S$ is a graded ring, then there is a bijection between the prime ideals of $(S_f)_{0}$ (the degree zero elements in $S$ localized at the element $f \in S$) and the homogeneous prime ideals in $S$ not containing $f$. We will avoid notation by proving the slightly stronger statement: If $A$ is a graded ring with an invertible element $f$ of positive degree, then there is a bijection between the prime ideals of $A_0$ and the homogeneous prime ideals of $A$. One direction is obvious (just use the inclusion $A_0 \to A$), for the other given a prime ideal $P_0$ in $A_0$, we define $P = \oplus Q_i$, where $Q_i \subset A_i$, and an element $a \in A_i$ is contained in $Q_i$ iff $a^{\deg(f)}/f^i \in P_0$. We are going to show that this is a prime ideal, and following the hints given, one of the steps in the proof of this claim is showing the above (i.e. $a_1^2 + 2a_1a_2+a_2^2\in Q_{2i}$).

One approach is to pick a Riemannian metric on $B$ and show that $C$ is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of $A$.  This proof extends to complex line bundles by choosing a Hermitian metric. If we leave the category of smooth bundles, a lack of bump functions means we can no longer assume a metric exists, although if we consider bundles equipped with a metric, the same proof should work. Question 1: Is there a proof that does not make use of a metric? Question 2: In what generality does it hold that short exact sequences of vector bundles split?

It would be very nice to have a solution of the form: when $n > m$ then $X$ must have... when $n < m$ then $X$ must have... when $n = m$ then $X$ must have...

Question: What is the zero subscheme of $s$? I can't believe that pouring through Hartshorne hasn't turned up a definition of this.  It should be some subscheme of $X$.  The only thing I can think of is the set of points $x \in X$ where $s$ goes to $0$ in the stalk $\mathcal F_x$, i.e., the complement of the support of $s$.  But that would make the zero subscheme of $s$ open and that doesn't make sense because in what I'm reading there is a hypothesis that $s$ is a regular section , and that this has something to do with the codimension of the zero scheme in $X$ (which would always be $0$ if the zero scheme were open).  Which leads me to question $2$: Question 2: What is a regular section ?  Is it a section whose zero subscheme is regular?

Now I will ask the question first then explain my thoughts and troubles :) We have a uniform distribution that has the following PDF: $\frac{1}{b-a}$. So far so good.
So if $n$ observations our Maximum Likelihood Function is: $\mathcal{L}(a,b)=\frac{1}{(b-a)^n}$ if each of these observations are independent and identically (i.i.d.) distributed. Now, after taking the log of the likelihood and taking the derivative once with respect to $b$ and once with respect to $a$ we have the following: The derivative with respect to $a$ is: $$\frac{n}{b-a}$$
and the derivative with respect to $b$ is:
$$\frac{-n}{b-a}$$ Now if we try to set either of these derivatives to zero and try to maximize the function, it will not yield anything useful. My problem arises here. Lets us just focus on maximizing $b$. I have read on this website as well as other places that to maximize $\frac{-n}{b-a}$ we have to take the maximum observation? How does that make sense, I mean should we not use the lowest observation to maximize this function? Because in this particular case, $n$ and $a$ are constants so we can easily just plug some numbers in and see that as $b$ gets bigger, the function get smaller, so why would we want the maximum observation?
