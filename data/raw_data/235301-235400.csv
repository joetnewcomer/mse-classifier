4923072,Is the completion of a (not necessarily Noetherian) local ring flat?,"Let $R$ be a commutative local ring with unity, $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal, and $\widehat{R}$ the $\mathfrak{m}$ -adic completion of $R$ . Is it true in general that the canonical morphism $R\rightarrow \widehat{R}$ is flat? If $R$ is Noetherian, it is a well-known result that $R\rightarrow \widehat{R}$ is faithfully flat. I am interested in the case where $R$ is $\textbf{not}$ Noetherian. If this is not true in full generality, are there any other conditions that ensure that this completion is flat?","['noetherian', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'flatness', 'commutative-algebra']"
4923090,Is $x^x = (x-1)^{x+1}$?,"Background: I was trying to estimate the size of $21^{21}$ for some problem and decided to use $20^{22}$ as hopefully a rough approximate ( $20^{22} = 2^{22} \cdot 10^{22} \approx 10^{28}$ ). But then I wanted to see if that was over or underestimate and got into this rabbithole of when they are equal. Anyways, I was doing some thinking and wanted to get an analytical solution to when $x^x = (x-1)^{x+1}$ . My original question was which was bigger for $x=21$ , but transitioned when I noticed that the $x^x > (x-1)^{x+1}$ for small $x$ , and then it flips when I go from $x=4$ to $x=5$ . I threw it in Desmos and got an approximate value of 4.141 (and I went woahhh that's $\pi +1$ but unfortunately that's only true to a couple decimal places :( ). Can anyone help me find an analytical or algebraic (as opposed to numerical/approximate) way of finding the value for x when these two expressions are equal? I was trying to approach it in a similar way to when $a^b$ grows faster than $b^a$ using logarithms but was struggling and would love some help if anyone has any suggestions. There is also this post which is similar but only talks about the inequality whereas I am more concerned about the equality. EDIT I found this paper which connects  the $x$ value of the solution to the original equation to be equal to $\alpha_0$ where $1+\frac{1}{(1+\frac{1}{(1+\frac{1}{...})^{\alpha}})^{\alpha}}$ converges for all $0 < \alpha < \alpha_0$ and diverges for all $\alpha > \alpha_0$ . Very interesting stuff. PS: I have an interesting follow up for $x^x$ vs $(x-n)^{x+n}$ that I would like to ask about but maybe some insight on this question will allow me to explore the following on my own :) Thanks!","['calculus', 'tetration', 'algebra-precalculus', 'transcendental-equations']"
4923094,"3.17 Brezis, $\ell^p$ convergence","I have been trying to try this exercise but either I have not understood it, or I have not been able to solve it. I would love to receive help on how to solve this exercise. 3.17 Let $\left(x^n\right)$ be a sequence in $\ell^p$ with $1 \leq p \leq \infty$ . Assuming $x^n \rightharpoonup x$ in $\sigma\left(\ell^p, \ell^{p^{\prime}}\right)$ prove that:
(a) $\left(x^n\right)$ is bounded in $\ell^p$ ,
(b) $x_i^n \underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} x_i$ for every $i$ , where $x^n=\left(x_1^n, x_2^n, \ldots, x_i^n, \ldots\right)$ and $x=$ $\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_i, \ldots\right)$ Conversely, suppose $\left(x^n\right)$ is a sequence in $\ell^p$ with $1<p \leq \infty$ . Assume that (a) and (b) hold (for some limit denoted by $x_i$ ). Prove that $x \in \ell^p$ and that $x^n \rightharpoonup x$ in $\sigma\left(\ell^p, \ell^{p^{\prime}}\right)$ . I don't know if part a) should come out directly because $x^n \in \ell^p$ and consequently is bounded in the norm? For b), I really have no idea how I could solve it, only I found this link about a previous question: Pointwise convergence and boundedness imply weak convergence in $\ell^\infty$ [EDIT:] I think b) it is possible prove with using that $x_i^n = \langle e_i, x^n \rangle \to \langle e_i, x \rangle = x_i$ .  Then $x_i^n \to x_i$ weak.

4923128,Finding area of the shaded region,"My attempts: Attempt 1: Radius of the circle = $5$ Angle $AOB = 45$ degrees hence area of shaded part between A and B = ${1\over 8} \times \pi \times 25 - {1\over 2} \times 5^{2}{1\over \sqrt{2}}$ Then, by multiplying this area by 8, we get the answer as 7.9, which doesn't match any answer.

4923163,Doubts regarding absolute value,"My fiancée is a teacher in a secondary school. She asked me a question connected to absolute value that I can't answer. Let's consider the following problem $$
\lvert x - 2 \rvert < \lvert x + 4 \rvert.
$$ The answer here is quite obvious, i.e. $x > -1, x \in \mathbb{R}$ . You can get the answer either by using a geometrical interpretation or dividing the real line in two points (i.e. 2 and -4) and consider some cases. Her students solve this problem using the following method. They consider two inequalities $x - 2 < x + 4$ and $x - 2 > -(x + 4)$ . They solve the inequalities, from the first one they get $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and from the second one $x > -1$ . That's the point that I think is wrong, but I don't have any proper argument against. When the students have two intervals (i.e. two answers from the inequalities) they either take the union or the sum of them . They use the following rule: use the logical operator (between the solutions to the inequalities) which would lead neither to the real line nor to the empty set. In the described example sum would lead to $\mathbb{R}$ so they choose intersection instead. The third point seems to be very wrong, nevertheless I can't find any decent argument which would prove that's it's not correct. Maybe it is? I would appreciate any counterexample or some argument for that. Edit.
Cases like $\lvert 2x \rvert < \lvert x \rvert$ are not the ones I'm looking for, because it's equivalent to $\lvert x \rvert < 0$ and now the third point does not appear.","['algebra-precalculus', 'absolute-value']"
4923165,Maximum coins with one Counterfeit coin among them that can be determined in 3 weighings given that the coin can be heavier or lighter,"What is the largest number of coins from which one can detect a counterfeit in three weighings with a pan balance, if it is known in advance only that the counterfeit coin differs in weight from the other coins? ----Zorich Mathematical Analysis I 2.2 Exercise 28 b) I have seen one answer online saying that: To find the largest number of coins we can detect a counterfeit from, in 3 weighings, we can perform the following steps: Consider the fact that we have three possible outcomes for each weighing: Left side is heavier, right side is heavier, or both sides are balanced. As there are 3 weighings, the total number of possible outcomes is
which is 27 possible outcomes. Keep in mind that one of these outcomes is ""all weighings are balanced."" This outcome corresponds to all the genuine coins being weighed. So, we have 26 distinct outcomes remaining for the coins with different weights. Divide the remaining outcomes into two groups, one for the heavier counterfeit coin and one for the lighter counterfeit coin. There will be
outcomes in each group. In each group, there are 13 outcomes. We can detect the counterfeit coin among 13 coins in each group. 6. In total, we can detect a counterfeit coin among
coins. Hence, the largest number of coins from which we can detect a counterfeit coin in three weighings with a pan balance is 26 coins. But I think the proof is unrigorous, so I want to ask for a rigorous solution to it. Also the subquestion prior to this subquestion states that there is a one to one correspondence between unbalanced ternary numbers to ternary numbers.That is, every $(\alpha_n\alpha_{n-1}\cdots \alpha_0)_3,\alpha_i\in\{0,1,2\}$ can be converted to $(\beta_m\beta_{m-1}\cdots\beta_0)_3,\beta\in\{-1,0,1\}$ Edit: And here is my solution to it: There are $3^3$ possibilities for weighings and they can't be all same, then $3^3-1$ , and then we have the possibility being divided over to heavier counterfeit coins and lighter counterfeit coins, and thus we have $\frac{3^3-1}{2}=13$ But I find it unrigorous and doubt if it is right.","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4923267,Why a vector function to $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be regarded as $n$ different functions?,"I am taking advanced calculus, and the professor said the following: we can regard $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ as $n$ different functions, and write $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ ."" I am not sure what the rigorous justification for representing the vector-valued function as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ (i.e. why we can write $f$ as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ ). How do we know that each component of the vector is a function of $p \in U$ ? I thought of the following: Since $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , then we know that $f(p)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , and thus we can write $f(p)$ as $f = (f_1,...,f_n)$ , where $f_i$ are the components of $f(p)$ . we can say that $f$ is comprised of $n$ different functions because when writing $f_i = \langle f, \mathbf{e}_i \rangle$ , we have $n$ different functions from $U$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ , so (I hope so) this answers why we can think of $f$ as being made of $n$ functions. but why $f_i$ is function? how do we know that each component of $f$ is a function on its own? I think that we have already established this on the previous point - since $f_i = (f,\mathbf{e}_i)$ , it is a composition of two functions ( $(*,\mathbf{e}_i): U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ composed over $f$ ), and thus is a function (or alternatively, say that $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$ which is again a function since it is the composition of the projection function over $f$ ). But I feel like I lack the ""intuitive"" understanding of why this is true... the only intuitive (and contorted) explanation I came close to is the following: Since $f$ is a vector-valued function, we know that $f(p) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , and since it is a vector, we know that the vector and its components are equivalent. Since we know that $p$ determines $f(p)$ and that it is equivalent to its components because it is a vector, we can say that each of its components is also a function of $p$ . I would be grateful if you could make these points clearer (and maybe provide a formal definition, as I think that the cause for my misunderstanding is the lack of a formal definition. I looked for formal definitions in the literature (Ruding for example, but since it is very basic I wasn't able to find any rigid and rigorous definitions there).","['elementary-set-theory', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'intuition']"
4923301,A very complete proof on the separability of $L^p$.,"I have to prove the following important result. Theorem . Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space such that: $(1)\;$ the measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is separable. $(2)\;$ $\mu$ is sigma finite. Then $L^p(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ is separable for $p\in [1,\infty)$ . We remember that a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is said separable if exists a countable family $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ sich that $\mathcal{\sigma}_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ , where $\sigma_0$ denotes the generated sigma algebra. We denote with $S(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ the set of all simple measurable function on $X$ a complex values.
We state two results that we will use. Theorem 1. Let $p\in [1,\infty)$ , then le simple function $S(X,\mathcal{A}, \mu)\cap L^p(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ are dense in $L^p$ . Lemma 2. Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a finite measure space. Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ a family such that $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ ; let $\mathcal{A}_0:=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ the generated algebra of $\mathcal{C}$ . Then for all $F\in \mathcal{A}$ e for all $\varepsilon >0$ exists $G\in\mathcal{A}_0$ such that $$\mu(F\setminus G)+\mu(G\setminus F)<\varepsilon.$$ First case $\Large \mu(X)<\infty$ We introduce the collection $$S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)=\{s\in S(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)\cap L^p\;:\; s(X)\subseteq\mathbb{Q}+i\mathbb{Q}\}$$ First step $S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X)$ is dense in $S(X)\cap L^p$ Let $\varepsilon > 0 $ and $s\in S\cap L^p$ fixed. Let $$s=\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \chi_{E_k}$$ the standard representation of $s$ . For all $k=1,\dots, n$ let $q_k$ be the complex number such that the real and imaginary parts are such that $$\max_{k=1,\dots, n}{|c_k-q_k|}<\frac{\varepsilon}{[n\mu(X)]^{\frac{1}{p}}}.$$ Then the simple function $$s_{\mathbb{Q}}=\sum_{k=1}^nq_k\chi_{E_k}\in S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X)$$ and results that \begin{eqnarray*}
\lVert s-s_{\mathbb{Q}} \rVert_p^p &=& \int_X \left | \sum_{k=1}^n(c_k-q_k)\chi_{E_k}\right |^p\; d\mu \\
&\color{red}{=}& \int_X\sum_{k=1}^n\lvert c_k-q_k \rvert^p\chi_{E_k}\;d\mu \\
&=&\sum_{k=1}^n\lvert c_k-q_k\rvert^p\mu(E_k) \\
&\le& \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\varepsilon^p}{n}\frac{\mu(E_k)}{\mu(X)}\\
&\le& \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{\varepsilon^p}{n}=\varepsilon^p
\end{eqnarray*} The red inequality arises from the fact that the $E_k$ are disjoint and the last inequality follows from the fact that $\frac{\mu(E_k)}{\mu(X)}\le 1$ Now, since the space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is separable, exists a countable family $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ . Evidently the generate algebra $\mathcal{A}_0:=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ is countable. Now, we introduce the collection $$S_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)=\left\{s=\sum_{k=1}^n d_k\chi_{G_k}\in S_{\mathbb{Q}}\;|\; G_k\in\mathcal{A}_0, n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}.$$ We observe that this collection is also countable. Second step $S_{\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{A}_0}(X)$ is dense in $S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X)$ Let $t\in S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X)$ , then $$t=\sum_{k=1}^nc_k\chi_{F_k},$$ where $F_k\in\mathcal{A}$ and $c_k\in \mathbb{Q}+i\mathbb{Q}$ ( $k=1,\dots, n$ ). From the above lemma 2 for all $k=1,\dots, n$ exists $G_k\in\mathcal{A}_0$ such that $$\mu(F_k\setminus G_k)+\mu(G_k\setminus F_k)<\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{nM} \right)^p,$$ where $M:=\max _{k=1,\dots, n}|c_k|$ . Define $$s=\sum_{k=1}^nc_k\chi_{G_k},$$ then $s\in S_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}$ and results that \begin{eqnarray*}
\lVert t-s \rVert_p &=& \left\lVert \sum_{k=1}^n c_k(\chi_{F_k}-\chi_{G_k})\right\rVert_p \\
& \stackrel{Minkowski}{\leq}& \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left\lVert c_k (\chi_{F_k}-\chi_{G_k})\right \rVert_p \\
&=& \sum_{k=1}^{n} \lvert c_k \rvert  \left\lVert \chi_{F_k}-\chi_{G_k}\right\rVert_p \\
&=& \sum_{k=1}^{n} \lvert c_k \rvert \{\mu(F_k\setminus G_k)+\mu(G_k\setminus F_k)\}^{1/p}< nM\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{nM} \right)=\varepsilon.
\end{eqnarray*} Now, let $f\in L^p$ , then for Theorem 1. exists $s\in S(X)\cap L^p(X)$ such that $\lVert f-s \rVert_p<\varepsilon$ . For the frist step exists $s_{\mathbb{Q}}\in S_{\mathbb{Q}}(X)$ such that $\lVert s-s_{\mathbb{Q}}\rVert_p<\varepsilon$ , for the step 2 exists $t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}\in S_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}$ such that $$\lVert s_{\mathbb{Q}}-t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0} \rVert_p<\varepsilon$$ , then $$\lVert f-t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0} \rVert_p<3\varepsilon$$ This completely proves the theorem in the finite case. Second case $\mu(X)=\infty$ Since $\mu$ is sigma finite exists an increasing sequence $\{E_n\}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ such that $$X=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n\quad\text{and}\quad \mu(E_n)<\infty\;\forall n\in\mathbb{N}.$$ Let $s\in S(X)\cap L^p$ , then $$\infty > \int_X \lvert s\rvert^p\;d\mu=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{E_n}\lvert s \rvert^p\; d\mu,$$ then $$(\forall \varepsilon>0)\quad (\exists n_0\in\mathbb{N})\quad(\forall n>n_0)\quad \int_{X\setminus E_n} \lvert s \rvert^p\;d\mu < \varepsilon$$ We define $t_n:=s\chi_{E_n}$ , then $\{t_n\}\subseteq S(X)\cap L^p(X)$ . $$\lVert t_n-s \rVert_p=\int_{X\setminus E_n} \lvert s \rvert\; d\mu<\varepsilon$$ for all $n>n_0$ . We choose $$t:=t_{n_0+1},$$ then $$\lVert t-s\rVert_p<\varepsilon.$$ The simple function $t$ is zero outside $Y:=E_{n_0+1}$ , then can be seen defined only on $Y$ , that is $t\in S(Y)\cap L^p$ , observe that $\mu(Y)<\infty$ . Thus we have that:
Let $f\in L^p$ be a function, then fro theorem 1 exists $s\in S(X)\cap L^p$ such that $\lVert f - s \rVert_p<\varepsilon$ . For above passage, exists $t\in S(Y)\cap L^p$ where $Y\in\mathcal{A}$ and $\mu(Y)<\infty$ such that $\lvert t - s\rVert_p<\varepsilon$ . For the first step applied to $Y$ exists $s_{\mathbb{Q}}\in S_{\mathbb{Q}}(Y)$ such that $\lVert t -s_{\mathbb{Q}}\rVert_{L^p(Y)}<\varepsilon$ and for the second step exists $t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}\in S_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}(Y)$ such that $\lVert s_{\mathbb{Q}}-t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}\rVert_{L^p(Y)}<\varepsilon$ . Defining $s_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and $t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}$ ugual to zero in $X\setminus Y$ we have that $$\lVert f - t_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0} \rVert_p<4\varepsilon$$ Question Is this a correct proof?","['proof-explanation', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification', 'real-analysis']"

What if we change that number to 5 or 7 or any odd number will the conjecture  still hold or there will be some loops that don't got to 1 and divergent sequence?
So is that $3$ arbitrary? Or there is a good reason for choosing it besides it is the smallest odd number bigger than 1? Also Is that $+1$ arbitrary? What happen if we change it to be any other odd number? Will that affect the conjecture?

Method 1: Show $f$ is bounded and use Liouville Here, I would suppose $f$ is entire and non-constant. If I can show that $f$ is bounded, I will have a contradiction which means that $f$ is constant.

Then, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $n \mid 3^{n - 1} - 2^{n - 1}$ is equivalent to $$q \mid 3^{p - 1} - 2^{p - 1} \quad \text{and} \quad p \mid 3^{q - 1} - 2^{q - 1}.$$ First, we claim that if $p \equiv 1, 5, 19, 23 \pmod{24}$ , then $p$ is not a primitive divisor of $3^{p - 1} - 2^{p - 1}$ (i.e. $p$ divides $3^x - 2^x$ for some $x < p - 1$ as well as $x = p - 1$ ). Indeed, if $p \equiv 1, 5, 19, 23 \pmod{24}$ , then $\bigl(\tfrac{6}{p}\bigr) = 1$ , using the Legendre symbol. By Euler's Criterion, $$6^{\tfrac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv \left(\frac{6}{p}\right) \equiv 1 \equiv 4^{\tfrac{p - 1}{2}} \pmod{p}.$$ By dividing both sides by $2^{\tfrac{p - 1}{2}}$ , we get that $p \mid 3^{\tfrac{p - 1}{2}} - 2^{\tfrac{p - 1}{2}}$ . The infinitude of primes of that form is given by Dirichlet's Theorem. Returning to the original problem, fix $p \ge 7$ to be some prime congruent to $1$ , $5$ , $19$ , or $23$ modulo $24$ . By Zsigmondy's Theorem, there exists a primitive divisor of $3^{p - 1} - 2^{p - 1}$ , which is distinct from $p$ . Let it be $q$ . Then, by minimality $\operatorname{ord}_q \bigl(\tfrac{3}{2}\bigr) = p - 1$ . Since we know that $q \mid 3^{q - 1} - 2^{q - 1}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem, $p - 1 \mid q - 1$ . This implies that $p \mid 3^{q - 1} - 2^{q - 1}$ . So, we are done. Questions: I believe that this proof is correct. However there are some things that I don’t like about it. Is there no easier way to prove that: There are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p$ is not the only primitive divisor of $3^{p - 1} - 2^{p - 1}$ ? My proof of this fact is rather long, relies on the reader being able to calculate $\bigl(\frac{6}{p}\bigr)$ using Gauss’s Lemma and the Quadratic Reciprocity, and I think it distracts from the overall motivation of the proof which is just Zsigmondy’s Theorem; everything else is just patching up the small holes. Also, I don’t particularly like how this proof relies on Dirichlet’s Theorem, as it is quite difficult to prove, although the special case of $p \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ is easier, using only cyclotomic polyonomials. Is there a completely different approach to the entire problem? Setting $n = pq$ was the only thing that came to me, however it also restricted the number of possibilities by quite a bit.","['contest-math', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

4923549,Is it weird that my probability theory lecturer thinks that $P(E)=0$ implies that $E=\emptyset$?,"I'm an undergraduate student in pure mathematics, and I'm taking a probability theory course based on the book A First Course in Probability by Sheldon Ross. My lecturer defined the conditional probability $P(A|B)$ of two events $A,B$ by $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$ , provided that $B\neq\emptyset$ . I knew that $P(\emptyset)=0$ , and after some research, I realized that the converse is not true, namely, from $P(E)=0$ we can't conclude that $E=\emptyset$ . I wrote to my lecturer, and among other things, I gave him a simple counterexample. (First I asked him to prove his claim, but instead he ""proved"" to me that $P(\emptyset)=0$ , but he relied on $P(E^c)+P(E)=1$ which was proved in the book by ""the finite version"" of Axiom 3, which was proved using Axiom 3 and the fact that $P(\emptyset)=0$ .) The simple counterexample was the sample space $S=\{1,2\}$ together with the function $P$ defined by $P(\{1\})=0,P(\{2\})=1,P(\{1,2\})=1,P(\emptyset)=0$ , it's a simple matter to verify that $P$ satisfies the three axioms of probability, yet $P(\{1\})=0$ and $\{1\}\neq\emptyset$ . Yet he went in circles claiming that every sample point in the sample space (i.e., a singleton subset of the sample space) needs to have positive probability—which is of course nonsense. I was getting the feeling that he doesn't like rigour, and on further researching, I found out that his background is in engineering and applied statistics. Is it normal that he has this false belief (I mean normal for people who are more interested in applied probability rather than rigorous mathematics)?","['axioms', 'soft-question', 'probability']"
4923557,"Understanding the proof of $L^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ is complete ($1\leq p<+\infty$)","Background I have some questions when reading the proof of $L^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ is complete for $1\leq p<+\infty$ . The proof is proceeded by showing that each absolutely convergent series in $L^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ is convergent: Suppose that $1\leq p<+\infty$ and that $\{f_k\}$ is a sequence of functions that belong to $\mathscr{L}^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ and satisfy $\sum_k\|f_k\|_p<+\infty$ . Define $g:X\to[0,+\infty]$ by $$
g(x)=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k(x)|\right)^p
$$ (of course $(+\infty)^p=+\infty$ ). Minkowski's inequality, applied to the function $|f_k|$ , implies $$
\left(\int\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^pd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \left\|\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right\|_p \leq \sum_{k=1}^n\|f_k\|_p
$$ holds for each $n$ , and so it follows from the monotone convergence theorem that $$
\int gd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^pd\mu \leq \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p\right)^p;
$$ thus $g$ is integrable. Consequently $g(x)$ is finite for almost every $x$ (Corollary 2.3.14), and the series $\sum_kf_k(x)$ is absolutely convergent, and hence convergent, for almost every $x$ . Define a function $f$ on $X$ by \begin{align*}
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k(x)\quad &\text{if $g(x)<+\infty$},\\
\\
0\quad &\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align*} Then $f$ is measurable and satisfies $|f|^p\leq g$ , and so it belongs to $\mathscr{L}^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ . Since $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(x)-f(x)\right|=0$ and $\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(x)-f(x)\right|^p\leq g(x)$ hold for almost every $x$ , the dominated convergence theorem implies that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\right\|_p=0$ . The completeness of $L^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ follows. My Questions Here are my questions: In order to apply the monotone convergence theorem, we need $g$ and $\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^p$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ to be $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions. But why are they? Why is the integrability of $g$ follows from that inequality? Why is $f$ $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable? Why is $|f|^p\leq g$ ? Why is $|f|^p\in\mathscr{L}^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ ? Why does $\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(x)-f(x)\right|^p\leq g(x)$ hold for almost every $x$ ? How does $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\right\|_p=0$ follow in the end? My Attempt I tried to answer these questions myself one-by-one, and here is my attempt: Note that for each positive integer $k$ the function $f_k$ is complex-valued and $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable, thus $|f_k|$ is nonnegative real-valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable, and so $\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|$ is nonnegative real-valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable.  For each positive integer $n$ let $F_n = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^p$ . Clearly $F_n$ is nonnegative real-valued. We now prove that $F_n$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. For any $t\leq0$ , we have $$
\{x\in X:F_n(x)<t\}=\emptyset\in\mathscr{A}.
$$ For any $t>0$ , we have \begin{align*}
\{x\in X:F_n(x)<t\} &= \left\{x\in X:\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k(x)|\right)^p<t\right\}\\
&= \left\{x\in X:\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k(x)|<t^{\frac{1}{p}}\right\}\\
&\in \mathscr{A}.
\end{align*} Thus $F_n$ is a nonnegative real-valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable function for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Moreover, for each $x\in X$ and for each positive integer $n$ the sequence $\{F_n(x)\}$ satisfies $F_n(x)\geq0$ and $F_n(x)\leq F_{n+1}$ , thus $\lim_{n\to\infty}F_n(x)$ is either a positive number or equal to $+\infty$ . So $g=\lim_{n\to\infty}F_n = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k(x)|\right)^p$ is well defined and it is a $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable function. The Minkowski's inequality implies $$
\left(\int F_nd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\leq\sum_{k=1}^n\|f_k\|_p
$$ holds for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Then this inequality, together with monotone convergence theorem and the convergence of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p$ , imply \begin{align*}
\int gd\mu &= \lim_{n\to\infty}\int F_nd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^pd\mu\\
&\leq \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n\|f_k\|_p\right)^p = \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p\right)^p < +\infty
\end{align*} (note that the existence of the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int\left(\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right)^pd\mu$ is implied by the monotone convergence theorem). Since $g$ is $[0,+\infty]$ -valued, it follows that $g^+=g$ and $g^-=0$ , and so $\int g^+d\mu$ and $\int g^-d\mu$ are both finite, which implies $g$ is integrable. Let $A=\{x\in X:g(x)<+\infty\}$ . Write $f$ as \begin{align*}
f &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k\chi_A\\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^nf_k\chi_A\\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty}h_n,
\end{align*} where $h_n = \sum_{k=1}^nf_k\chi_A$ . We prove that $A\in\mathscr{A}$ . We know that $g$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. Define $p:X\to[0,+\infty]$ by $p(x)=+\infty$ for all $x\in X$ . Then $\{x\in X: p(x)<t\}=\emptyset\in\mathscr{A}$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ , and thus $p$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. Therefore, $A = \{x\in X:g(x)<p(x)\}\in\mathscr{A}$ , and so $A^c\in\mathscr{A}$ . Next, note that for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ , $f_k$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. Moreover, for $t\leq0$ , $\{x\in X:\chi_A(x)<t\}=\emptyset\in\mathscr{A}$ ; for $t>1$ , $\{x\in X:\chi_A(x)<t\} = X\in\mathscr{A}$ ; for $1<t\leq1$ , $\{x\in X:\chi_A(x)<t\} = A^c\in\mathscr{A}$ . Thus, $h_n$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable, and so $f=\lim_{n\to\infty}h_n$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. If $x\in A$ , then $|f(x)|^p = \left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\right|^p \leq \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k(x)|\right)^p = g(x)$ . If $x\notin A$ , then $|f(x)|^p=0\leq g(x)$ . We first prove that $|f|^p$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. If $t\leq0$ , then $\{x\in X:|f(x)|^p<t\}=\emptyset\in\mathscr{A}$ . If $t>0$ , then $\{x\in X:|f(x)|^p<t\} = \{x\in X:|f(x)|<t^{\frac{1}{p}}\}\in\mathscr{A}$ because $f$ and thus $|f|$ is $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable. Therefore, $|f|^p$ is a $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable function. We know that $g$ is also a $[0,+\infty]$ -valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions. The integrability of $g$ implies that $\int gd\mu = \int g^+d\mu < +\infty$ . Then $|f|^p\leq g$ implies $\int|f|^pd\mu\leq\int gd\mu <+\infty$ . Since $\left(|f|^p\right)^+=|f|^p$ and $\left(|f|^p\right)^- = 0$ , we have $|f|^p$ is integrable, and so $|f|^p\in\mathscr{L}^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ . If $x\in A$ , then \begin{align*}
\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(x) - f(x)\right|^p &= \left|\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}f_k(x)\right|^p\\
&= \lim_{m\to\infty}\left|\sum_{k=n+1}^mf_k(x)\right|^p\\
&\leq \lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=n+1}^m|f_k(x)|\right)^p\\
&= \left(\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}|f_k(x)|\right)^p\\
&\leq \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k(x)|\right)^p\\
&= g(x).
\end{align*} Thus, $\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k(x)-f(x)\right|^p\leq g(x)$ holds for almost every $x$ . We know that $g$ is a $[0,+\infty]$ -valued integrable function on $X$ . Define functions $q$ and $q_1,q_2,\dots$ by $q=0$ and $q_n = \left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\right|^p$ . Then for all $x\in A$ , $q=\lim_{n\to\infty}q_n$ , and so $q=\lim_{n\to\infty}q_n$ holds $\mu$ -almost everywhere. Also, $|q_n|<g$ holds $\mu$ -almost everywhere. So the dominated convergence theorem implies $0=\int qd\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int q_nd\mu$ and so $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\int q_nd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = 0$ . Hence $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\int\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\right|^pd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\|_p = \|\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^nf_k - f\|_p = \|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k - f\|_p = 0$ . Therefore, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k = f \in\mathscr{L}^p(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ . Where I Have Trouble My main concern is my attempt to Question 7. There are mainly two of them: First, I claimed that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int q_nd\mu=0$ implies $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\int q_nd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = 0$ . But I am not sure whether this is legit, because I have never seen a ""power law of limit of sequence"" from any analysis textbook. Basically, if $p\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = a\in[-\infty,+\infty]$ , does this imply $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n^p = a^p$ ? I don't think this is correct, because $a^p$ may not even be defined (consider for example square root of a negative number or the denominator is zero). But what if $a_n\in[0,+\infty]$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $p\in\mathbb{R}_+$ ? How can we generalize such a result (in its most general possible case) and prove it? Secone, I claimed that the limit of norm is the norm of limit. But is this true? Why? Basically, $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k-f\right\|_p = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\int\left|\sum_{k=1}^nf_k - f\right|^pd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}$ , but is this equal to $\left(\int\left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k-f\right|^pd\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}$ ? Why? Last but not least, I know this is a lot to ask, but just in case you are interested in the proof, I would really appreciate it if you could help me check whether my answer to the other questions are correct.

4923611,How to find examples of $L^p$ converging random variables where a specified non-Lipschitz continuous function does not converge in $L^p$?,"Background: I am preparing for a probability theory exam, and am struggling with a particular type of problem.

The specific function $g$ changes every year, so I am looking for motivation on how to construct these counterexamples. For completeness, $X_n$ converges to $X$ in $L^p$ (denoted: $X_n \xrightarrow{L^p} X$ ) if: $$\mathbb E [ | X_n - X \mid ^p] \rightarrow 0 $$ I know that this does not imply that $g(X_n)$ converges to $g(X)$ in $L^p$ in general unless $g$ is bounded or Lipschitz continuous (interestingly, Nate Eldredge informed me that there exist non-bounded, non-Lipschitz functions that still converge in this manner, although for the purposes of this question, those are not relevant). How can I find examples of $L^p$ converging random variables, $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ , where a specified non-Lipschitz continuous function of these random variables, $g(X_n)$ , does not converge in $L^p$ ?

Some examples include taking $g(X_n)$ as $e^{X_n}$ and $X_n^2$ and showing that they do not converge in $L^p$ for all $X_n$ converging to $X$ in $L^p$ . At the moment, my strategy involves guessing sequences of random variables $X_n$ that I suspect converge in $L^p$ and then checking to see if these are suitable counterexamples. I would appreciate it if there is a more rigorous strategy I can employ. Note: I am not interested in knowing answers to those particular examples above, I am more interested in understanding a more general approach (although it may be helpful to refer to those to explain the general approach). Note $_2$ : I do not necessarily expect there to be a completely generalizable approach to this type of question. Therefore, if the best that can be done is to give some strong intuition as to how to think about constructing these sequences of random variables, then that also constitutes an answer to my question.

The superscripts $t$ and $z$ denote the transverse (x, y) and longitudinal (z) components, i.e.: $$\nabla^{t}M = \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial M}{\partial y},0\right)$$ is the transverse part of the gradient, and: $$\boldsymbol{N}^{t} = \left(N_{x}, N_{y}, 0\right);$$ $$\boldsymbol{N}^{z} = N_{z}.$$ At this point they state that they use ""an integration by parts"" and they somehow manage to move the nabla so that it is cross-product multiplied with $\boldsymbol{B}$ , i.e. the final expression should contain something like this: $$A(\nabla \times \boldsymbol{B})$$ together with other terms and the correct superscripts, which I have omitted here because I don't know them. Does anyone know some integration by parts formula that can help me get from the original expression to something looking like this? Any help and advice is much appreciated.

4923748,Difference between compensator of point process under real parameter an its MLE estimator,"Suppose we have some point process $N=N_{\theta_0}$ on the real line, driven by a conditional intensity $\lambda_{\theta_0}$ dependent on some finite-dimensional parameter $\theta_0\in\Theta\subset\mathbb R^d$ . Given an observation of this point process $N$ on $[0,T]$ , we intend to estimate $\theta_0$ by its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\hat\theta_T$ , which is the solution to $$0=\int_0^T\frac{\dot\lambda_\theta(t)}{\lambda_\theta(t)}[\mathrm dN(t)-\lambda_\theta(t)\mathrm dt].$$ Details about such procedures can be found in The asymptotic behaviour of maximum likelihood estimators for stationary point processes by Ogata, 1978. I'm interested in the compensator of point processes, i.e. $\Lambda_\theta(t)=\int_0^t\lambda_\theta(s)\ \mathrm ds$ . In particular, I was wondering whether something can be said about the difference $\Lambda_{\hat\theta_T}(T)-\Lambda_{\theta_0}(T)$ . Does this satisfy some limiting equation? Is anything known about this in the literature? E.g. is $T^{-1/2}(\Lambda_{\hat\theta_T}(T)-\Lambda_{\theta_0}(T))$ Gaussian, or does it satisfy some (functional) CLT? It is known that $\hat\theta_T\to\theta_0$ in probability as $T\to\infty$ (see e.g. Theorem 2 from the paper by Ogata; which, however, does not say anything about the speed of convergence). Under regularity conditions from the same paper, $\lambda_\theta$ is locally Lipschitz in $\theta$ , so $\lambda_{\hat\theta_T}\to\lambda_{\theta_0}$ . Then it should not be too difficult to say something about $T^{-1}(\Lambda_{\hat\theta_T}(T)-\Lambda_{\theta_0}(T))$ , but I'm particularly interested in some nondegenerate limit for (something like) $$T^{-1/2}(\Lambda_{\hat\theta_T}(T)-\Lambda_{\theta_0}(T)).$$ Any help or reference is much appreciated.","['statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'point-processes', 'stochastic-processes', 'maximum-likelihood']"
4923780,Does $\sqrt{n}$-consistency imply consistency?,"It seems that $\sqrt{n}$ -consistency and consistency are quite different concepts. The former roughly says that most of the values attained by the scaled difference $\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}_n - \theta)$ are finite (regardless of $n$ ). The latter says that eventually most values of $\hat{\theta}_n$ are arbitrary close to $\theta$ (i.e. for large $n$ ). What is the formal relation between these two concepts? The accepted answer to this question states that $\sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}_n - \theta) = O_p(1) \Longrightarrow \hat{\theta}_n - \theta = o_p(1)$ . Why is this implication true? How can I prove it? Here is my attempt at proving the above implication: Say $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists M > 0$ such that $\sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} P(\sqrt{n} \lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > M) < \epsilon$ . That is, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ $P(\sqrt{n} \lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > M) < \epsilon$ . In particular, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ we have $P(\lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > \delta_n) < \epsilon$ , where $\delta_n := \frac{M}{\sqrt{n}} \rightarrow 0$ . From here, I'm not sure how to proceed to conclude that $\hat{\theta}_n - \theta = o_p(1)$ . That is, I want to conclude that $\forall \delta > 0$ $P(\lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > \delta) \rightarrow 0$ . I guess the reason I'm confused is that I've shown the convergence $P(\lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > \delta_n) \rightarrow 0$ when $\delta_n \rightarrow 0$ . This seems unsatisfactory, because what I really ought to show is that $P(\lvert \hat{\theta}_n - \theta \rvert > \delta) \rightarrow 0$ for any $\delta > 0$ where $\delta$ is not required to change with $n$ .

There exists a unique permutation matrix $\pi$ for all $k\geq 0$ such that $$\mathrm{diag}(A^k) = \pi~ \mathrm{diag}(B^k)$$ if and only if $$\mathrm{diag}(A^k) = \pi~ \mathrm{diag}(B^k) ~~~(\star)$$ for $0\leq k \leq n$ . $\textbf{My approach:}$ ( $\implies$ ) follows by defintion.

We need a small lemma before we go: $\textbf{Lemma:}$ $$\mathrm{diag}: M_{n\times n} \to M_{n \times 1}$$ is a linear map.
Then it follows that $$\mathrm{diag} (A^\ell) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \mathrm{diag}(A^i)$$ Similarly, we get that $$\mathrm{diag}(B^\ell) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i \mathrm{diag}(B^i)$$ Using $(\star)$ we get that $$\mathrm{diag} (A^\ell) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \mathrm{diag}(A^i) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \pi(\mathrm{diag}(B^i)) = \pi(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \mathrm{diag}(B^i)) $$ So it only remains to show that $$ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \mathrm{diag}(B^i) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i \mathrm{diag}(B^i)$$ I don't immidiately see why\if this is true.

The state space is $K = \{-1, +1\}$ with transition rates specified as by the parameters $v, H > 0$ in the following manner $$k(-1,+1) = v \quad \text{and} \quad k(+1,-1) = H/v.$$ We are then aksed to compute the following expectation value $$<e^{x_t}|x_0 = 1>,$$ for some time $t$ . Now I found that $$<e^{x_t}|x_0 = 1> = e \cdot S(t) = e \cdot e^{tL}$$ where S(t) is the semigroup (equivalent of transition matrix) and $L$ is the backward generator. I also found that $L$ is given by $$\begin{pmatrix}
-v & v\\
H/v & -H/v
\end{pmatrix}$$ However I do not see how I should now interpret $S(t)$ , since the question asks me to derive an expression for this expectation value in function of the parameters $v$ and $H$ . Ok, so I found out the expression i already have for the expression value is wrong and I could solve the exercise with the use of the Master equation, however I would like to know how i could sove it using the semigroup and generator formalism.

I know that $$\mu_t = \mu_0S(t)$$ where mu_t is the probability row matrix at time $t$ and $\mu_0$ the same at time $0$ .

4923969,A kind of generalized eigenvalue problem,"Let $A$ , $B$ and $C$ denote three complex $2 \times 2$ matrices. Find necessary and sufficient conditions on $A$ , $B$ and $C$ for the existence of a nonzero $v \in \mathbb{C}^2$ such that $Av$ , $Bv$ and $Cv$ are all nonzero, and $Av$ , $Bv$ and $Cv$ are all multiples of each other. Motivation: I was playing around with a problem and was led to formulate the problem above. Well, actually, I am trying to prove a statement by contradiction. I assumed the statement was false, and then was able to show that it would imply the existence of a $v$ such as above for some specific $A$ , $B$ and $C$ . This led me to ask the question above, which is a kind of generalized eigenvalue problem, and can be formulated independently. Edit: I am thinking that the problem can be reformulated as to whether or not some rational cubic curve in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ intersects non-trivially the ""standard"" twisted cubic. Indeed, consider the map $\gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\operatorname{Sym}^3(\mathbb{C}^2)$ which is defined by $$ \gamma(v) = Av \odot Bv \odot Cv. $$ This induces a cubic rational map $\tilde{\gamma}$ from $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ . I think that the image of this map can be written as an intersection of quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ , but I am not entirely sure. On the other hand, the twisted cubic is (up to some binomial coefficients) induced by the map $$ v \mapsto v \odot v \odot v.$$ And the image of the twisted cubic in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ is known to be the vanishing locus of an ideal which is generated by $4$ quadrics (it is not a complete intersection). So the problem is equivalent to whether or not the image of $\tilde{\gamma}$ intersects non-trivially the image of the twisted cubic. So I think it amounts to whether or not the common vanishing locus of finitely many quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{C}$ is non-empty. Also note that a similar question was asked before here, see @Theo Bendit's comment below. There is an answer in the linked post but I am hoping to get an alternative solution which is more algebro-geometric.","['linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"
4924008,Taking derivative to determine differentiability,"The ""correct"" way to determine differentiability is to use the definition of the derivative as a limit. However, sometimes we have a function with a piecewise definition. Say for example (just an example, the question itself is more general) $f(x)=\begin{cases} 
e^x & x\leq 0\\
{\sin x} & x>0 \end{cases}$ A ""shortcut"" is to take the derivative of both pieces of the function at the ""breaking point"" $x=c$ and take the right hand and left hand limits of the derivatives as x approaches c. However, their equality does not always imply that the function is differentiable. In the above case this would not work: the limits of the derivatives of both parts are 1, but the function itself is not differentiable at $x=0$ because it is not continuous at the point. So it is only differentiable in the neighbourhood of x=0 but not at 0 itself. However, if the function above were continuous, say we had $(\sin x)+1$ instead, it would be differentiable at x=0.
It seems that continuity of f at x=0 was the ""missing piece"" to making it differentiable. So my question is, do the equality of the limits of the derivatives of $f$ from both sides of $x=c$ , AND the continuity of $f$ at $c$ , together imply that the function is differentiable at x=c? If yes can we prove it?","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

In any other case $f\circ f$ would be defined in a set $B=\{ x\in A  \land  f(x)\in A\}$ where A is the domain of $f$ . But since here $f$ is defined in the empty set , so the statements $x\in A$ and $f(x)\in A$ make no sense since there is no $x$ . What I have thought is $$(f\circ f)(x)=f(f(x)),\forall x\in\emptyset$$ If we are considering functions as sets of ordered pairs, the empty function is represented as the empty set of pairs: $$f=\emptyset$$ and so the composition $f\circ f $ would also be the empty set because there are no pairs to compose. $$f\circ f=\emptyset$$ From the post linked above and my experience. For a function $f:\emptyset \to Y$ the composition $f\circ f$ is again an empty function $\emptyset\to Y$ . This aligns with the formal properties of function composition where the domain remains empty and thus the result is trivially an empty function.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

We call $1 − α$ the coverage of
the confidence interval. Warning! $C_n$ is random and $θ$ is fixed. I cannot understand the expression $P_\theta(\theta\in C_n)$ . In general, if we have a random variable $X:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)\to (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ , we define $$P(X\in S) := X_*P(S) = P(X^{-1}(S))$$ for $S$ in the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}$ .

Any help in writing a complete and correct proof : To show that there are only finitely many pairs of positive integers $(n, m)$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ , where $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$ , we need to compare the growth rates of $d(m!)$ and $n!$ . Understanding the Growth of $d(m!)$ The number of divisors of $m!$ , denoted $d(m!)$ , depends on the prime factorization of $m!$ . If $m!$ is expressed as $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ , where $p_i$ are primes and $e_i$ are their respective exponents, then:
The number of divisors $d(m!)$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$ . The exponents $e_i$ for each prime $p_i$ can be approximated as: $e_i$ is roughly the sum of the integer divisions $\left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots$ . For large $m$ , the dominant term in this sum is approximately $\frac{m}{p_i}$ . Comparing Growth Rates
Let's approximate the growth rate of $d(m!)$ :
The number of prime numbers less than or equal to $m$ is approximately $\frac{m}{\log m}$ by the Prime Number Theorem.
Each $e_i$ is roughly $\frac{m}{p_i}$ , and the product $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$ grows very rapidly. Growth of $n!$ :
Stirling's approximation for $n!$ provides a way to understand its growth: $n!$ grows roughly as $\sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n$ . Comparing $d(m!)$ and $n!$ To compare $d(m!)$ and $n!$ : $d(m!)$ grows super-exponentially with $m$ , much faster than the factorial function $n!$ grows with $n$ . For large $m$ , $d(m!)$ becomes significantly larger than any $n!$ . This means that for sufficiently large $m$ , there cannot be an $n$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ . Since $d(m!)$ grows much faster than $n!$ as $m$ and $n$ increase, there can only be finitely many pairs $(n, m)$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ . Once $m$ reaches a certain threshold, $d(m!)$ will exceed $n!$ for all $n$ , limiting the possible pairs to a finite set.","['contest-math', 'number-theory', 'divisor-counting-function', 'modular-arithmetic']"

My question: is $N(f)$ ever rational? Note that if it is the case that $N(f)$ is never rational, we're almost certainly not going to be able to prove it in this thread. By taking $f(n)=n$ we obtain $\zeta(3)$ , which was only proven to be irrational in the 1970s, and apparently ""at least one of $\zeta(5), \zeta(7), \zeta(11),\zeta(13)$ must be irrational"" ( see link ), so I assume the irrationality of these numbers individually is unknown. But I'm wondering if I'm missing some $f$ for which it is not too hard show is a counterexample to the conjecture "" $N(f)$ is never rational.""

If we say $a_k, b_k$ are defined such that $$\frac{a_k}{b_k} = \sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n^2f(n)}$$ is in lowest terms, then we know $$\frac{a_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}} = \frac{a_k}{b_k} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2f(k+1)} = \frac{a_k (k+1)^2f(k+1) + b_k}{b_k (k+1)^2f(k+1)},$$ so in particular $da_{k+1} = a_k (k+1)^2f(k+1) + b_k$ , $db_{k+1} = b_k (k+1)^2f(k+1)$ , where $d$ is the gcd of the numerator and denominator.

Given the following two definitions of convexity of $f$ , prove that (i) implies (ii): (i) $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) \ge f(y) + f'(y)(x - y)$ (ii) $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \forall \lambda \in [0, 1] : f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda)y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda)f(y)$ I think definition (i) is incorrect. I think it would be correct, if we would assume $x,y$ arbitrary but we must have $x \geq y$ . Since (i) is differently written: $$\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y} \ge f'(y)$$ So the gradient/slope from $y$ to $x$ is greater than the slope of $y$ . That makes sense because in a convex function the slope increases. But if we choose $y$ to be greater than $x$ , then it's wrong. Let me give this example: We have $f(x)=x^2$ and $x,y=\pm 1$ . The slope from $x$ to $y$ (or $y$ to $x$ ) is $0$ . It's the black line in the plot. The slope at $-1$ is $-2$ , that's the green line. So we indeed have $-2 \le 0$ . But if we pick $x$ and $y$ to be $x=-1$ and $y=1$ , then the statement (i) is false, since it would state that $0 \ge 2$ . So to me it seems, the correct definition would be: (i) $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \ge y : f(x) \ge f(y) + f'(y)(x - y)$","['convex-analysis', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

theorem, to find an UMVU estimator (UMVUE) for $\lambda^2$ via $\hat{\gamma}: \mathbb{N}^n_0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}_0 $ , $\hat{\gamma}(x)=x_1x_2$ , with respect to the statistic $T:\mathbb{N}^n_0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}_0, T(x)=\sum_\limits{{i=1}}^n x_i$ . In other words we have to calculate the following expected value: $$\hat{\gamma}^*(t):=\mathbb{E}_{\lambda}(\hat{\gamma}(X)|T(X)=t), \quad t \in \mathbb{N}_0$$ where $X=(X_1, \dots , X_n)$ , ( $X_1, \dots , X_n \stackrel{iid}{\sim}Pos(\lambda))$ is the random variable inducing the statistical model. We need $T$ to be a complete and sufficient statistic and $E_{\lambda}(\hat{\gamma})<\infty$ , for $\hat{\gamma}^*$ being UMVUE. I already solved this by applying Lehmann-Scheffe, to another  unbiased estimator for $\lambda^2$ and the same statistic $T$ , then concluded that $\hat{\gamma}^*$ has to be equal to my UMVUE, since UMVUE are unique. I then tried to calculate the above expected value, but I am stuck evaluating it, here is what I have done so far : For $t \in \mathbb{N_0}$ : $\mathbb{E}_{\lambda}(\hat{\gamma}(X)|T(X)=t)=\sum_\limits{x \in \mathbb{N}_0^n}x_1x_2\mathbb{P}_{\lambda}(X=x|T(X)=t)=\sum_\limits{x \in \mathbb{N}_0^n}x_1x_2\mathbb{P}_{\lambda}(X_1=x_1, \dots , X_n=x_n|\sum_\limits{{i=1}}^n X_i=t)$ I have concluded that: $$\mathbb{P}_{\lambda}(X_1=x_1, \dots , X_n=x_n|\sum_\limits{{i=1}}^n X_i=t)=

You roll this ellipse to the right along the positive $x$ axis, such that it is always tangent to the $x$ axis.  You stop rolling when the elliptical boundary of the disc becomes tangent to the $x$ axis at $(5, 0)$ .  If a point $P_0 = (-2, 3) $ is on the disc before rolling, find its position after rolling. My attempt: The distance travelled on the $x$ axis, is the same traversed on the boundary of the ellipse.  From the parametric equation of the ellipse, one can determine the eccentric angle of the point of tangency on the rolled ellipse using the arc length (which is equal to $5$ ).  Then, the initial and final normal vectors to the circumference of the ellipse can be computed, and the angle between them determines the rotation of the ellipse.  Having the tangency point and the rotation determines the center of the rolled ellipse.  The affine transformation between the initial points on the disc and rolled images is given by $ p' = C + R (p - C_0) $ where $R$ is the rotation matrix resulting from rolling, $C_0$ is the initial center (equal to $(0, b)$ ) and $C$ is the final center.

My attempt: From tangency between circles $(1)$ and $(2)$ , it is fairly easy to find the radius of circle $(2)$ , and this also gives its center. For the ellipse, the center has to lie halfway between the top and bottom sides of the square.  What is unknown is the $x$ coordinate of this center ( $C_x$ ).  The points of tangency with the two circles are also unknown, and in addition the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse and the angle of rotation of the major axis from the standard orientation along the $x$ axis is also unknown.  Using parametric equations for the two circles, we need two parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ (unknown) to describe the two tangency points with the ellipse. So the unknowns are: $t_1, t_2, a, b, \theta, C_x $ . Six equations can be written to describe the tangency with the top (and the bottom) side, and the right side of the square, and tangency with the two circles.

4924696,Why are Lebesgue integrals defined as a supremum and not as a limit?,"We may approximate a bounded nonnegative function $f$ by simple functions $\phi$ . Then the  standard way of defining the Lebesgue integral of $f$ is $$ \int f d\mu := \sup \Bigg\{ \int \phi : \phi \leq f, \phi \textrm{ is simple}\Bigg\}.$$ I am very comfortable with this definition but it was not until recently while learning about Ito integrals that I began thinking about why the Lebesgue integral is not defined as a limit. Loosely speaking, if $X_t$ is a stochastic process and $B_t$ a Brownian motion, then the Ito integral $\int_0^t X_s B_s$ is defined by first finding a sequence of elementary processes $E^n_t$ that converge to $X_t$ in $L^2$ , and then defining $$\int_0^t X_s dB_s := L^2-\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int E_s^n dB_s.$$ I am curious why a similar construction doesn't work for the Lebesgue integral.

Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed last month . Improve this question The integral that I need to calculate is the integral of the second kind: $$I=\iint_{S} x^{2}\:dydz + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )\:dx dy$$ with $S$ being the boundary of the following object: $x^2 + y^2 \leq z \leq 1$ . I have not so much experience with multivariable calculus, so I am not so familiar with the notation. I figured (allegedly) that it is surface integral, and the region would be something like $$0\leq x^{2}+y^{2}\leq z\leq 1\implies \begin{cases}
-1\leq x\leq 1 \\
-1\leq y\leq 1 \\
0\leq z\leq 1
\end{cases}$$ Integrating the function itself is easy but the integral is what I do not know how to solve. Can someone help me with this? I believe that I understood the problem wrong. For those that want to close the question because of the lack of detail, that thing is the entire statement of the problem. Nothing else. And I am being thrown off because there's someone who also said that I have to instead solve the problem as $$I=\iint_{S} x^{2}\:dydz + \iint_{R} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )\:dx dy$$ for another object $R$ Attempt 1 Alright, let's try it again. For this problem, I think the surface would be $$x^{2}+y^{2}=z, 0\leq z\leq 1$$ This means that we can parameterize it as: $$r(v,u)=(v\cos{(u)}, v\sin{(u)}, v): \begin{cases}
0\leq u\leq 2\pi \\
0\leq v\leq 1
\end{cases}$$ The integral is seems to be denoted in differential form, which is $$I=\iint_{S} x^{2}\:dy\wedge dz + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )\:dx\wedge dy$$ As provided by Kurt. G. Then, we can obtain the vector field $F=(x^{2},0,x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})$ .
Then, I can calculate the surface integral now using: $$\iint_{S}Fdx \land dy + G dy\land dz+Hdz\land dx=\iint_{D}\left[ F \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} + G\frac{\partial(y,z)}{\partial (u,v)}+\frac{\partial(z,x)}{\partial (u,v)} \right] dudv$$ Am I right? Attempt 2 Okay, I was dumb. Now, the parameterization is wrong.
if $(x,y)=v\cos(u),v\sin{(u)}$ , then $z=v^{2}$ . Hence, instead, we have... $$r(u,v)=(v\cos{(u)},v\sin{(u)},v^{2}),\begin{cases}
0\leq u\leq 2\pi \\
-1\leq v \leq 1
\end{cases}$$ Theoretical Concepts Since I want a bit of mind toward the theoretical base that I am working on, I'll just leave it here.
Let $S$ be a smooth parameterized surface: $$\begin{cases}
x=f(u,v) \\
y = g(u,v) \\
z = h(u,v) \\
(u,v)\in D
\end{cases}$$ with orientation corresponding to the ordering $u,v$ . Then, we have $$dx=\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}dv$$ Similarly, $$dy=\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}dv$$ Hence, $$\begin{split}
dx\land dy & = \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}du + \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}dv \right)\land\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}du + \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}dv \right)\\ 
& = \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}- \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) du \land dv
\\& =\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}du\land dv
\end{split}$$ Working all the same, we got $$\begin{align}
dx\land dy = \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}- \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) du \land dv
 =\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}du\land dv \\
dy\land dz = \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \frac{\partial z}{\partial v}- \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \frac{\partial z}{\partial u} \right) du \land dv
 =\frac{\partial(y,z)}{\partial(u,v)}du\land dv \\
dz\land dx = \left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial u} \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}- \frac{\partial z}{\partial v} \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \right) du \land dv
 =\frac{\partial(z,x)}{\partial(u,v)}du\land dv
\end{align}$$ Then, we can use $$\iint_{S}Fdx \land dy + G dy\land dz+Hdz\land dx=\iint_{D}\left[ F \frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} + G\frac{\partial(y,z)}{\partial (u,v)}+\frac{\partial(z,x)}{\partial (u,v)} \right] dudv$$ which is guaranteed by Stoke's theorem. Working out the whole thing is a problem, since it's quite long. Still, writing everything in order as $$I=\iint_{S} (x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} )\:dx \land dy +x^{2}\:dy\land dz$$ For the first term, converting to the new coordinate $(u,v)$ : $$\begin{cases}
r_{1}=v^{2}\cos^{2}{(u)}+v^{2}\sin^{2}{(u)}+(v^{2})^{2}=v^{2}(1+v^{2})\\
r_{2}=v^{2}\cos^{2}{(u)}
\end{cases}
$$ For a vector field $F(r_{1},r_{2},0)$ . I think I will be able to solve this more, but it is quite long, and after this it is kind of trivial, so if I am right, this is the path of solution.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus']"

\frac{dy}{dx}&=v,\qquad &y(x_0)=y_0
\\ \frac{dv}{dx}&=F(x,y,v),\qquad &v(x_0)=?
\end{aligned}$$ Suppose we have some numerical method (some Runge-Kutta, mostly interested here in simple RK1, Euler's Method). Now, we can take a guess at $v(x_0)$ : for example we can shoot straight at $y(x_f)$ by using our numerical method to attack a system of IVPs by taking $v(x_0)=v_0$ where: $$v_0=\dfrac{y(x_f)-y(x_0)}{x_f-x_0}.$$ We implement our method and we get, as an approximation to $y(x_f)=y_f$ , we get, say: $$y_f(v_0)\approx y_f.$$ Say the discrepancy is: $$\varepsilon(v_0)=y_f(v_0)-y_f.$$ Now we can plot $\varepsilon$ vs $v_0$ and where $\varepsilon$ is zero we have approximations to the solution that at least satisfy the second boundary condition. When the original ode is suitably linear, it is the case for any two points $(v_a,y_a-y_f)$ and $(v_b,y_b-y_f)$ on this curve, we have $\varepsilon$ is zero at: $$v_a+\frac{y_f-y_a}{y_b-y_a}(v_a-v_b).$$ Because the curve in this case is a line.
This formula can be understood on a more basic level if you start drawing pictures in the $x$ - $y$ plane. Is there a good, online and available reference that discusses this curve?

4925028,Laplace's Equation on a Pac-Man,"I am struggling way too much with this problem, any help is highly appreciated. Consider the Pac-Man-like set described by $$P=\left\{(\rho\cos\theta,\rho\sin\theta):\rho\in(0,1),\theta\in\left(\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{7\pi}{4}\right)\right\}$$ whose boundary can be described by $\partial P=\Gamma\cup\gamma_+\cup\gamma_-$ with $\Gamma=\{(\cos\theta,\sin\theta):\theta\in\left[\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{7\pi}{4}\right]\}$ and $\gamma_{\pm}=\{(x,\pm x):x\in[0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]\}$ as shown below ( plotted with desmos ). I want to find a solution of the Laplace equation $\psi_{xx}+\psi_{yy}=0$ for $\psi:\overline{P}\to\mathbb{R}$ with boundary conditions $$\boxed{\begin{cases}\psi\vert_{\Gamma}(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)=(\theta-\frac{\pi}{4})(\theta-\frac{7\pi}{4})\\ \psi\vert_{\gamma_+}(x,x)=\psi\vert_{\gamma_-}(x,-x)=0\end{cases}}$$ This is because I want it to be a non-zero polynomial on $\Gamma$ , zero on $\gamma_{\pm}$ and continuous on $\partial P$ . My question then is: Does such a $\psi:\overline{P}\to\mathbb{R}$ exist? If so, how can I compute it? Now I will show what I've managed to do. Suppose that we could express $\psi$ as a Fourier series like $$\psi(\rho\cos\theta,\rho\sin\theta)=a_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\rho^n(a_n\cos(n\theta)+b_n\sin(n\theta))$$ Then, we have by the boundary conditions $\psi\vert_{\gamma_{\pm}}=0$ that $$\begin{cases}0=\psi\left(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=a_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\rho^n(a_n\cos(n\pi/4)+b_n\sin(n\pi/4))\\ 0=\psi\left(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=a_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\rho^n(a_n\cos(n\pi/4)-b_n\sin(n\pi/4))
\end{cases}$$ which immediately implies $a_n=0$ for $n\not\equiv2(\text{mod }4)$ and $b_n=0$ for $n\not\equiv0(\text{mod }4)$ by adding and subtracting both power series and equating the coeficients to zero. However, this means that $$\psi(\rho\cos\theta,\rho\sin\theta)=a_2\rho^2\cos(2\theta)+b_4\rho^4\sin(4\theta)+a_6\rho^6\cos(6\theta)+...$$ And this is incompatible with the boundary condition for $\Gamma$ since, on $\Gamma$ , $\psi$ isn't $\pi$ -periodic while the right-hand side is. Note that $\rho^{-n}\cos(n\theta),\rho^{-n}\sin(n\theta)$ for $n\geq1$ and $\log\rho$ cannot appear in the polar form infinite series since these are not defined for $(x,y)=(0,0)$ and $(0,0)\in\overline{P}$ . So does this mean that Laplace's equation has no solution on $\overline{P}$ with those boundary conditions? Edit: In this question , user83387 states Suppose we look for solutions to $\Delta u = 0$ on the circular sector $\{ (r, \theta) \mid 0 < r < a, 0 < \theta < \gamma \}$ with initial conditions $u(a, \theta) = g(\theta), \, u(r, 0) = u(r, \gamma) = 0$ . Using separation of variables, I showed that the solution is of the form $$ u(r, \theta) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2a^{-\frac{n\pi}{\gamma}}}{\gamma} \left(\int_0^\gamma g(\phi)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi \phi}{\gamma}\right) \, d\phi\right)  \, r^{\frac{n\pi}{\gamma}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi\theta}{\gamma}\right)$$ This is precisely what I needed shifting $\theta$ by $\pi/4$ radians and considering $a=1,\gamma=3\pi/2$ .

This looks like the inverse Fourier transform of $\frac{1}{1+|x|}$ , but I'm not sure what to do with this fact. If I expand $e^{ikx}$ , I get $$\lim_{R\to \infty}\int_{-R}^R\frac{e^{ikx}}{1 + |x|}dx =\lim_{R\to\infty}\left[\int_{-R}^R\frac{\cos(kx)}{1 + |x|}dx + i\int_{-R}^R\frac{\sin(kx)}{1 + |x|}dx \right]$$ The imaginary part is zero because $\frac{1}{1+|x|}$ is even and $\sin(kx)$ is odd over a symmetric domain. Therefore we just have to worry about $$\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{-R}^R\frac{\cos(kx)}{1 + |x|}dx=\lim_{R\to\infty}2\int_0^R\frac{\cos(kx)}{1+x}dx$$ now integrating by parts, we may set $u=\frac{1}{1+x}$ so that $du=\frac{-1}{(1+x)^2}dx$ and $v=\frac{1}{k}\sin(kx)$ and $dv=\sin(kx)dx$ . Usng integration by parts $$2\int_0^R \frac{\cos(kx)}{1+x}dx = \left.\frac{2}{k}\frac{\sin(kx)}{1+x}\right|_0^R-2\int_0^R \frac{-1}{k(1+x)^2}\sin(kx)dx.$$ Now $$\left|\int_0^R \frac{\sin(kx)}{(1+x)^2}dx\right|\leq \int_0^R\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}dx=\left.\frac{-1}{1+x}\right|_0^R= \frac{-1}{1+R} + 1$$ Therefore, we get that the integral converges absolutely, so the limit exists.

This is easy enough to verify with algebra by observing that if for some (x,y): $$ Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 $$ Then there exists an $x'$ and $y'$ s.t. (if $\phi$ is invertible) $$ A \phi(x')^2 + B\phi(x')\phi(y') + C\phi(y')^2 + D\phi(x') + E\phi(y') + F  = 0$$ And therefore $$ A  \left( \frac{ax' + by' + c}{dx'+ey'+f} \right)^2 + B  \left( \frac{ax' + by' + c}{dx'+ey'+f} \right) \left(  \frac{gx'+hy'+i}{dx'+ey'+f} \right) + C \left(  \frac{gx'+hy'+i}{dx'+ey'+f} \right)^2 + D \left( \frac{ax' + by' + c}{dx'+ey'+f} \right) + E  \left(  \frac{gx'+hy'+i}{dx'+ey'+f} \right)  + F  =  0 $$ But by multiplying out all the denominators and grouping like powers of $(x')^n(y')^m$ we can clearly see that $(x',y')$ itself lies on some conic section. So then (it feels clear to me that) we can conclude $\phi$ sends a conic section to a section. The question: Now is this set of $\phi$ the ONLY continuous functions $\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ that send conics to conics?

Let $dig(n)$ be the number of digits in the decimal representation of $n$ . Is it true that $dig(3^n+2^n)=dig(3^n)$ when $n \geq 3$ is a natural number? Of course, $\frac{dig(3^n)}{dig(2^n)}=\frac{ln(3)}{ln(2)}$ approximately, which is around $1.5$ . So in order that to happen $3^n$ should have a lot leading nines, namely around $1-\frac{ln(2)}{ln(3)}$ percent of all digits, which is around $37$ percent. One possible approach is to consider log base 10 of $3^n$ , but it didn't really lead me to anything vital. To be precize, in order for $3^n$ to start with $k$ nines, $nlog_{10} 3$ mod $1$ should be in the range $[log_{10} (10^k-1)$ mod $1,1)$ . The length of it is $l=log_{10}(\frac{10^k}{10^k-1})$ , then $\frac{1}{l}=log_{1+\frac{1}{10^k-1}}(10)$ , which is approximately $ln(10)10^k$ . Then by Diophantine's theorem there exists an $n \leq ln(10)10^k$ such that $3^n$ starts with $k$ nines. But in this estimation $k$ is asymptoticly $log_{10}(n)$ , however we need a constant multiplied by $n$ . Unfortunately, that was the only idea that popped into my mind.",['number-theory']

Let's think about the system as an undamped spring-mass system. The input to the system is an impulse of magnitude $F_0$ at time $\pi$ . For $t<\pi$ we have a simple homogeneous equation and the solution is $$x(t)=\sin{(t)}$$ Note that $x(\pi)=0$ and $x'(\pi)=-1$ . At $t=\pi$ the impulse changes the velocity to $F_0$ . To solve the system for $t\geq\pi$ I once again solved $$x''+x=0$$ with the initial conditions $$x(\pi)=0$$ $$x'(\pi)=F_0$$ Since the solution is $$x(t)=c_1\cos{(t)}+c_2\sin{(t)}$$ and $$x'(t)=-c_1\sin{(t)}+c_2\cos{(t)}$$ the constants come out to $c_1=0$ and $c_2=-F_0$ . The solution is thus $$x(t)=-F_0\sin{(t)}$$ Why do I have to, apparently, add in the solution obtained for $t<\pi$ ?

Then the simple functions in $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ form a dense subspace of $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ The book defines $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}$ as follows: Definition $\quad$ Let $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu,\mathbb{R})$ be the set of all bounded real-valued $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable functions on $X$ . Define $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$ by letting $\|f\|_{\infty}$ be the infimum of those nonnegative numbers $M$ such that $\{x\in X:|f(x)|>M\}$ is locally $\mu$ -null. We only consider real-valued functions. Here is the proof: Proof $\quad$ Let $f$ belong to $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu,\mathbb{R})$ , and let $\epsilon$ be a positive number. Choose real numbers $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n$ such that \begin{align}
    a_0<a_1<\dots<a_n
\end{align} and such that the intervals $(a_{i-1},a_i]$ cover the interval $[-\|f\|_{\infty},\|f\|_{\infty}]$ and have lengths at most $\epsilon$ . Let $A_i=f^{-1}((a_{i-1},a_i])$ for $i=1,\dots,n$ , and let $f_{\epsilon}=\sum_{i=1}^na_i\chi_{A_i}$ . Then $f_{\epsilon}$ is a simple $\mathscr{A}$ -measurable function that satisfies $\|f-f_{\epsilon}\|_{\infty}<\epsilon$ . Since $f$ and $\epsilon$ are arbitrary, the proof is complete. So my understanding of the idea of this proof is the following: For each $f\in\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu,\mathbb{R})$ and each $\epsilon>0$ , we want to construct a simple function $f_{\epsilon}$ in $\mathscr{L}^{\infty}(X,\mathscr{A},\mu,\mathbb{R})$ so that $$
\|f-f_{\epsilon}\|_{\infty} = \inf\Big\{M\in\mathbb{R}_+:\{x: X:|f(x) - f_{\epsilon}(x)|>M\}\ \text{is locally $\mu$-null}\Big\}<\epsilon.
$$ So, if we can construct $f_{\epsilon}$ such that $\{x\in X:|f(x)-f_{\epsilon}(x)|>\epsilon\}$ is locally $\mu$ -null, then we are done. I can see that in the proof, if $x\in A_i$ for some $i$ , then $f(x)\in(a_{i-1},a_i]$ and $f_{\epsilon}(x)=a_i$ , and so $|f(x)-f_{\epsilon}(x)|<\epsilon$ . But I don't understand why we need to let the intervals $(a_{i-1},a_i]$ cover the interval $[-\|f\|_{\infty},\|f\|_{\infty}]$ . I don't think I understand how $f_{\epsilon}$ is constructed either.

\frac{\partial\phi_{i}(x,y)}{\partial x_{j}} & =-0.5(y_{j}-2y_{j+1}+y_{j+2}).\\
\frac{\partial\phi_{i}(x,y)}{\partial x_{j+1}} & =0,\\

4925850,What is the transition semigroup of toroidally wrapped Brownian motion?,"More generally, let $(B_t)_{t\ge0}$ be an $\mathbb R^d$ -valued Lévy process and $W:=\iota(B)$ , where $$\iota:\mathbb R^d\to[0,1)^d\;,\;\;\;x\mapsto x-\lfloor x\rfloor$$ (the floor function is applied componentwisely). I was able to show $^1$ that $W$ is again a time-homogeneous Markov process. However, I fail to identify its transition semigroup. Let $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ denote the transition semigroup of $B$ . In the present setting, that means $$(\kappa_tf)(x)=\operatorname E\left[f(x+B_t)\right].$$ Now let $\mu_t:=\mathcal L(B_t)$ denote the distribution of $B_t$ . We should clearly have that the distribution of $W_t$ is $$\mathcal L(W_t)=\mu_t\circ\iota^{-1}\tag5.$$ For that reason, my candidate for the transition semigroup of $W$ was $$\tilde\kappa_t(x,\;\cdot\;):=\kappa_t(x,\;\cdot\;)\circ\iota^{-1}\;\;\;\text{for }x\in[0,1)^d.$$ But this seems to be wrong (most probably due to the way I treated $x$ ). In fact, if $f,g:[0,1)^d\to\mathbb R$ are bounded and Borel measurable, I get \begin{equation}\begin{split}\operatorname E\left[f(W_s)g(W_{s+t})\right]&=\int\mu_s({\rm d}x)(f\circ\iota)(x)(\kappa_t(g\circ\iota))(x)\\&=\int\mu_s({\rm d}x)(f\circ\iota)(x)(\tilde\kappa_tg)(x),\end{split}\tag6\end{equation} where I've used that $(B_s,B_{s+t})\sim\mu_s\otimes\kappa_t$ . This is still not the form we need. So, how can we proceed and how is the correct definition for the transition semigroup of $W$ ? $^1$ $B_{s+t}$ and $\mathcal F^B_s:=\sigma(B_r,0\le r\le s)$ are conditonally independent given $B_s$ . Since $W_r$ is $\sigma(B_r)$ -measurable and consequentially $\sigma(W_r)\subseteq\sigma(B_r)$ for all $r\ge0$ , we conclude that $W_{s+t}$ and $\mathcal F^W_s$ are conditionally independent given $B_s$ . That is, $$\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid\mathcal F^W_s\right]=\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid B_s\right]\tag1.$$ Note that we can write $$\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid B_s\right]=\operatorname E\left[f(\iota(W_s+B_{s+t}-B_s)\mid B_s\right].\tag2$$ So far, this remains true if $X$ would just be any time-homogeneous Markov process. Now we use that $B_{s+t}-B_s$ and $B_s$ are independent to conclude $$\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid B_s\right]=\left.\operatorname E\left[(f\circ\iota)(x+B_{s+t}-B_s)\right]\right|_{x\;=\;W_s}\tag3$$ to conclude $$\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid B_s\right]=\operatorname E\left[f(W_{s+t})\mid W_s\right]\tag4.$$","['levy-processes', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory']"
4925886,Question about continuous functional calculus and its application,"I recently started learning about the topic functional calculus. My problem is that I have no idea on how to use it for, say, solving problems, exercises etc. Here is a short review of what I learned so far. The idea behind functional calculus seems to be that one would like to ""apply"" a function $f$ to an operator $T$ .
If for example $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $T: H_1 \rightarrow H_2$ , the term $f(T)$ does not make any sense, since the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$ . But one could still make sense of the term $f(T)$ . For example, if we consider a matrix $M \in M_{n \times m }$ and $f$ to be a polynomial, for example $f(x)=3x^3-x^2$ . Then $f(M)$ could be viewed as $3M^3-M^2$ , which are defined for matrices, so everything is fine. Let $H$ denote a complex Hilbert space. And $L(H)$ denote the set of bounded and linear operators on $H$ . Then the range of $T$ was introduced as $R(T):=\{\langle Tx,x\rangle: \lVert x\rVert =1\}$ .
It is mentioned that $R(T)$ is bounded, thus $R(T)$ is compact. Then it is shown that for $T \in L(H)$ , $\sigma(T) \subset \overline{R(T)}$ . (Where $\sigma(T)$ denotes the spectrum of $T$ .) If T is self-adjoint, then $\sigma(T) \subset [m(T),M(T)]$ , where $m(T):=\inf\{\langle Tx,x\rangle :\lVert x\rVert=1\}$ and $M(T):=\sup\{\langle Tx,x\rangle :\lVert x\rVert=1\}$ . After those technicalities, it is mentioned that one wants to define $f(T)$ for $f \in C(\sigma(T))$ . Let $f$ be a polynomial with complex coefficients, i.e. $f(t):=\sum_{k=0}^nc_kt^k$ . Then $f(T)$ means the operator $\sum_{k=0}^nc_kT^k$ . One crucial thing seems to be that polynomials are dense in the set of continuous functions. Let $t$ denote the identity function and $1$ denote the constant function $t \mapsto 1$ . Theorem (Continuous functional calculus)
Let T \in L(H) be self-adjoint. Then there exists exactly one map $\Phi: C(\sigma(T)) \rightarrow L(H)$ such that $\Phi(t)=T, \Phi(1)=Id$ $\Phi$ is linear, $\Phi(fg)= \phi(f)\phi(g)$ and $\Phi( \overline{f})=\Phi(f)^*$ $\Phi$ is continuous We call $\Phi$ the continuous functional calculus of $T$ .
We will write $f(T):=\Phi(f)$ for $f\in C(\sigma(T))$ . As mentioned at the beginning, I have no idea on how to approach a problem using (continuous) functional calculus.
For example, I tried to find some exercise that should be solvable by using functional calculi, but I do not know how to approach those neither how to use functional calculus. Here are some of the Problems I found: Let $T \in L(H)$ be self-adjoint and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \setminus(\sigma(T))$ . Then $d(\lambda, \sigma(T))=\lVert (T-\lambda Id)^{-1}\rVert^{-1}$ Let $T \in L(H)$ be self-adjoint and f \in C(\sigma(T)). Show that the following are equivalent:
(i) $f(T)$ is a positive operator
(ii) $f \geq 0$ If $T \in L(H)$ is a self-adjoint Operator, then there exist two positive operators $T_1,T_2 \in L(H)$ such that $T=T_1-T_2$ (Are $T_1$ and $T_2$ unique?) I assume that I am missing some crucial idea or point, and that's the reason why I have no clue in how to approach the problems above. Small Edit:
My guess in approaching problems by using functional calculus is to define the function $\Phi$ (that is literally called continuous functional calculus of $T$ ) and then to try to use some denseness argument to get to the result. But how does one ""find"" $\Phi$ . In the Theorem, it is stated that there exists (exactly one) $\Phi$ , but not how to find it.","['c-star-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'functional-calculus', 'operator-algebras']"
