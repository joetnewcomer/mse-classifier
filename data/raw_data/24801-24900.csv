221302,How to express a set of objects in the language of maths?,"I am trying to describe a simple algorithm using the language of mathematics.
But I am a programmer and used to think in terms of objects (as in object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design and object-oriented programming ). Here are the classes I have: A changeset represents a set of changes. Each change has an operation (either ""ADD"" or ""REMOVE"") and a statement (I think it does not matter here what a statement is). There are also some objects: Set<Statement> s0;
Set<Statement> s1;
Set<Statement> s2;
ChangeSet c1;
ChangeSet c2; c1 is derived from s0 and s1 by some function delta : c1 = delta(s0, s1) And so is c2 : c2 = delta(s0, s2) Now let's try to represent this in the language of maths: $$ \mathbb C_1 = \{ c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_1) $$
$$ \mathbb C_2 = \{ c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_2) $$
$$ c_{i,j} = (p_{i,j}, s_{i,j}) $$
$$ \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_i) =
\{ (""-"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_0 \setminus S_i} \} \cup
\{ (""+"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_i \setminus S_0} \}
$$ where $p_{i,j}$ is an operation and $s_{i,j}$ is a statement. It looks pretty compact but there are two things that bother me: I had to replace an object with a pair of variables $(p_{i,j}, s_{i,j})$ because I was unsure how to address ""fields"" of objects in the language of maths. Now since they are not objects, they loose its ""type"", they are just ""pairs"". I had to replace sets with arrays with indices. So now I have to think about $\Bbb C_1$ and $\Bbb C_2$ as of a big matrix of values rather than two sets of objects. But this is only a part of problem. I have to use indices everywhere and, for example, when I want iterate over $\Bbb{S^- = S_1 \setminus S_2}$, while keeping having in memory the big matrix, I reluctantly write $s_j \in \Bbb S^-$. Is there anything I miss?
Am I complicating things?
Is there a way to operate true objects in the language of maths? So that I can write something like
$$ \Bbb S^+ = \{ c.statement | c \in \Bbb C ( c.operation = ""+"" ) \} $$
instead of 
$$ \Bbb S^+ = \{ s_i | c_i \in \Bbb C ( p_i = ""+"" ) \}. $$","['matrices', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Yeah... it's terrible, but I have no intuition as to how to prove this in any other way. Also, the proofs I saw in the lectures were sometimes as unconvincing as this one I just came up with.

221367,Why do we use the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$?,"On the train home, I thought I would try to prove $\pi$ is irrational. I needed a definition, so I used: $\pi$ is the area of the unit circle. But what is a circle? A circle is the set of tuples $(x,y)$ satisfying ""$x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$"". That seems a little awkward - is there a more natural way to say it? The standard distance metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is ""$\sqrt{(x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2}$"". A circle is the unit ball of this metric, and $\pi$ is its area. But why do we use this metric in the first place? Why not use the Taxicab metric - it's linear so it'd seem to satisfy even more nice mathematical properties. Because of the Pythagorean theorem. And what property of $\mathbb{R}^2$ lets us prove the Pythagorean theorem? This one took a little more thought. I think it comes about because we want to associate lengths to lines that are equivalent under translations and rotations. Translations seem pretty natural - but I'm having trouble defining rotations without being circular: If you multiply a coordinate tuple by the appropriate matrix, you get a rotation - but the matrix's entries involve $\sin$ and $\cos$, which I would define as the coordinates on the unit circle(which is circular). I can define the set of all infinite lines that go through the origin. Except for the vertical line, you might assume they all have the form $L_m = \{(x,y)|y = mx\}$ for some $m \in \mathbb{R}$. Given an $m \in \mathbb{R}$, I can't find an obvious way to get the point on the unit circle corresponding to it. The complex number route just gives $\sin$ and $\cos$. Circular, again. We can determine whether two vectors are orthogonal using the dot product. That reduces defining the entire unit circle to defining just a single quadrant(if we also assume the length of $-1 * x$ is the same as $x$). A quick Google search shows circles were a primitive notion in Euclid's Elements. There is another question/answer given here, but I was still left confused as to what a rotation actually is in $\mathbb{R}^2$: Why is the Euclidean metric the natural choice? So my questions are: Out of all the possible metrics, why choose the Euclidean metric as the natural one? I think it's rotation that's the root cause, but that might end up being a red herring. How do we define a natural equivalence of points up to rotation from first principles? This is related to #1. If we define the set of infinite lines through the origin, you can choose a representative element from each one and form a perimeter curve(assuming a continuous choice function). What properties does the circle have that would make it a natural choice?","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'metric-spaces', 'circles']"

221376,Moment Generating Function for a discrete random distribution,"(Discrete uniform distribution) A discrete random variable is said to be uniformly distributed if it assumes a nite number of values with each value occurring with the same probability. If we consider the generation of a single random digits, then $Y$ , the number generated, is
uniformly distributed with each possible digit,$ 0, 1, 2, ... , 9$ occurring with probability $\frac{1}{10}.$

221418,Matrix factorization as a product of triangular matrices,"Is it true that any square matrix $A $ can be factorized as a product of only triangular matrices? 
That is, can we write $A $ as $\prod_{i=1}^k B_i$, where every $B_i$ is either a lower or an upper triangular matrix (for some natural $ k $)? Note $ k $ is not assumed to be 2 above. So the question is not (directly) about the $LU$ decomposition. Comment : We know that for any square matrix $A$ we have: $A=PLU$ where $P$ 
is a permutation matrix, $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular matrix. So the question possibly boils down to whether any permutation matrix can be factorized to triangular matrices.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
221423,Proving Baire's theorem: The intersection of a sequence of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is nonempty,"The following is problem 3.22 from Rudin's Princples of Mathematical Analysis : Suppose $X$ is a nonempty complete metric space, and $\{G_n\}$ is a sequence of dense open subsets of $X$. Prove Baire's theorem, namely, that $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty G_n$ is not empty. Hint: find a shrinking sequence of neighbourhoods $E_n$ such that $\overline{E}_n\subset G_n$. Here's what I've tried so far: Let $\{r_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence of positive real numbers converging to $0$. Fix $x\in X$ and define $E_i=\{g\in G_i:d(g,x)<r_i\}$, which is nonempty since $G_i$ is dense. I would like to show that for all $i$, $\overline{E}_i\subset G_i$ (I had convinced myself that this would be true but I am now having doubts). Let $e\in \overline{E}_i$. Then either $e\in E_i$ or $e$ is a limit point of $E_i$. If $e\in E_i$ then $e\in G_i$. Otherwise, every neighbourhood of $e$ contains a point in $E_i$. I thought that I should be able to then choose some point $e'\in E_i$ in a neighbourhood of $e$ and, since $G_i$ is open, it'll have a neighbourhood $N\subset G_i$ which contains $e$, but this is proving to be difficult and I'm worried that it's not true. If I can show that this is true then the rest will follow from results I've already proven. Does my approach make any sense? Incidentally, as a secondary question, what type of a thing would $G_n$ be? A sequence of dense open subsets seems weird to me—at first I was thinking of some sequence of infinite subsets of rational numbers in the real numbers but I realized that those aren't open. Is there anything which would be familiar to my little undergrad brain which would be analogous to this problem?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'baire-category']"

If $X$ is complete and every $x^*\in X^*$ attains a maximum on $B$  then $B$ is weakly-compact. (see Theorem 6, page 139 in  MR0165344 (29 #2628) James, Robert C. Weakly compact sets. Trans. Amer.

If $X$  is not quasi-complete then there exists a weakly-closed set $B\subset X$ such that every $x^*\in X^*$ attains a maximum on $B$  and $B$ is not weakly-compact. James also built an example of a normed linear space that is not complete but  each continuous linear functional attains its supremum on the unit

221688,"$D^m\cup_h D^m$, joining $D^m \amalg D^m$ along the boundary $\partial D^m$","Given an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism $h: \partial D^m \to \partial D^m$, we can glue two copies of the closed unit disk $D^m$ along the boundary by identifying $x \sim h(x)$ to form the quotient space
$$\Sigma(h) := (D^m \amalg D^m)/\sim$$
Now we can give this quotient a smooth structure such that the obvious inclusions $D^m \hookrightarrow \Sigma(h)$ are smooth embeddings and in fact it turns out that for any two smooth structures, there exists a diffeomorphism between them. So $\Sigma(h)$ is a unique manifold up to diffeomorphism. So far, so good. Now, in Kosinski's 'Differential Manifolds', there is the following Lemma: Lemma: $\Sigma(h)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^m$ if and only if $h$ extends over $D^m$. Moreover, $\Sigma(gh) = \Sigma(h)\# \Sigma(g)$. Here $M\# N$ denotes the connected sum of two manifolds as usual. The proof of this is left as an exercise for the reader, but I'm unsure, how one might construct an extension of $h$ to $D^m$, given that $\Sigma(h)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^m$? I know that in this case $h(\partial D^m)$ necessarily separates $\Sigma(h) = S^m$ into two components, and since $h(\partial D^m)$ is an embedded compact $(m-1)$-manifold (which is smooth), I can also prove that $h(\partial D^m)$ is the boundary of both connected components of its complement. But at this point I get lost. Is it clear that these two components are diffeomorphic to disks? Where might I find a proof of this? I'm fine with the other parts of this Lemma, but I just don't see how to extend $h$ given $\Sigma(h) = S^m$. If you could help me out, this would be very much appreciated.

This is the proof in text: (1) The pole set of a rational function is an algebraic subset of $V$. (2) $\Gamma (V)=\cap_{P\in V}\mathcal{O}_P(V)$ Proof. Suppose $V\subset A^n$. For $G\in k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$, denote the residue of $G$ in $\Gamma (V)$ by $\bar G$. Let $f\in k(V)$. Let $J_f = \lbrace G \in k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]\;|\; \bar Gf \in \Gamma (V)\rbrace$. Note that $J_f$ is an ideal in $k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$ containing $I(V)$, and the points of $V(J_f)$ are exactly those points
  where $f$ is not defined. This proves (1). If $f\in \cap_{P\in V}\mathcal{O}_P(V), V(J_f)=\emptyset$, so $1\in J_f$ (Nullstellensatz!), i.e., $1\cdot f= f\in \Gamma (V)$, which proves (2). Firstly, since $\Gamma(V)$ is not a rational function, I assume the goal of $J_f$ is to ""remove"" the denominator of $f$. If that is the case, suppose $f=a/b$, where $a,b\in \Gamma(V)$. Then $J_f=\lbrace b\cdot g\;|\;g\in k[X_1,\dots,X_n]\rbrace$. Is this right? (For simplicity I assume $a,b$ has no common factor) If $b\cdot g\in I(V)$, then $\bar {(bg)} = 0$ and $\bar {(bg)}f=0\in\Gamma(V)$. I suppose this is why $I(V)\subset J_f$. I have no idea why $V(J_f)$ describes the points where $f$ is not defined. Clearly if $f$ is not defined at some $P$, $b(P)=0$ and hence $(bg)(P)=0\implies P\in V(J_f)$. But on the other hand, let $P\in V(J_f)$ and $h=b\cdot g\in J_f$. Then $h(P)=0$ and $h(P) = (bg)(P)\implies b(P)g(P)=0$ So the proof implies that $b(P)=0$, which means $g(P)\neq 0$ I am guessing that if $g(P)=0$ then $\bar {(bg)}f\not\in\Gamma(V)$, but I do not know why. Finally, I am also unable to see why this process proves (1). P.S. I am also not quite sure how the part on ""residue of $G$ in $\Gamma(V)$ by $\bar G$"" comes into play.

222034,How to characterize the continuous functions from an infinite set with the cofinite topology to a Hausdorff space?,"The problem Let $X$ be an infinite set with the cofinite (finite complement) topology and let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space. Characterize the continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$. What I have so far For a function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ to be continuous, we have that $f$ is continuous $\iff$ for any open set $U$ of $Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$, or, equivalently: $f$ is continuous $\iff$ for any closed set $B$ of $Y$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$. The closed sets of $X$ are all the finite subsets of $X$ or all of $X$. Since every finite point set $W$ in a Hausdorff space is closed, we must have that $f^{-1}(W)$ is either a finite subset of $X$ or all of $X$. But what about the infinite closed subsets of $Y$? I don't really know where to go from here. Am I on the right track here? Should I be looking at the closed sets at all? Any help appreciated!","['general-topology', 'continuity']"

In this case the Möbius function, assigning 0 to every $n\in A$ which is not square free, 1 to square free elements which are the products of an even number of primes and -1 to square free products of odd number of primes, is an inverse of the constant function 1. Then the Möbius inversion formula $$f(n) = \sum_{d|n} g(d)\Longrightarrow g(n) = \sum_{d|n}f(d)\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)$$ is simply another way of writing $$f = g\ast 1\Longrightarrow g = f\ast \mu.$$ Is there a similarly general and elegant approach to the multiplicative formula $$f(n) = \prod_{d|n}g(d)\Longrightarrow g(n) = \prod_{d|n} f(d)^{\mu(n/d)}?$$ Thank you.","['elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Given $\alpha, \alpha'$ we say $A_{\alpha} \sim A_{\alpha'}$ if there exist $\alpha_{1}, ..., \alpha_{n}$ such that $A_{\alpha} \cap A_{\alpha_{1}} \neq \emptyset, ..., A_{\alpha_{n}} \cap A_{\alpha'} \neq \emptyset$. We see that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Consider $A$ to be an equivalence class and $F$ to be the union of all elements of $A$. Considering $a = \inf F$, $b = \sup F$ (where $a, b$ take values in the extended reals), we claim $F = (a, b)$. Let $a < x < b$. It suffices to see $x \in F$. This is clear since there exists $\alpha, \alpha'$ with $A_{\alpha}, A_{\alpha'}$ in $A$ such that $A_{\alpha}$ contains points smaller than $x$ (since $x$ is not the infimum) and $A_{\alpha'}$ contains points greater than $x$. Taking $\alpha_{1}, ..., \alpha_{n}$ as in the definition we see that for some $i$, $A_{\alpha_{i}}$ contains $x$. If it is not true that $A_{\alpha} \sim A_{\alpha'}$ then $A_{\alpha} \cap A_{\alpha'} = \emptyset$. Thus each $F$ is disjoint, and the union of $A_{\alpha}$ is the union of the $F$.
