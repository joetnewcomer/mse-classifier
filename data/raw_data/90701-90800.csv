1222331,"If $f+f'<\varepsilon$, then $f'<\varepsilon$","Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ and there exstis $\varepsilon>0$ such that $f(x)+f'(x)<\varepsilon$ for all $x\in (a,b)$. Prove that $f'(x)<\varepsilon$ for all $x\in (a,b)$. These are my efforts: $\bullet$ If $f(x)\ge 0$ then $f'(x)<\varepsilon$, so we just need to consider those $x$ such that $f(x)<0$. $\bullet$ Consider $g(x)=f(x)\cdot e^x-\varepsilon\cdot e^x$ then $g$ decreases on $(a,b)$. If $f(c)<\varepsilon$, then $f(x)<\varepsilon$ for all $x\in [c,b]$. $\bullet$ If $f(x_0)\ge \varepsilon$ for some $x_0$ then $f$ increases in some neighborhood of $x$. I cannot completely solve it.

1222336,Show that an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{H^n}$ is open in $\mathbb{R^n}$ iff $U \cap \partial\mathbb{H^n}=\phi$,"Consider the $n-$dimensional closed half-space $\mathbb{H^n}=\{x \in \mathbb{R^n}|x_1 \le 0 \}$ and let $\partial \mathbb{H^n}=\{x \in \mathbb{H}|x_1=0\}$ be its boundary. Show that an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{H^n}$ is open in $\mathbb{R^n}$ iff $U \cap \partial\mathbb{H^n}=\phi$ My try: Suppose that an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{H^n}$ is open in $\mathbb{R^n}$. Then let's assume that $\vec{x} \in U \cap \partial\mathbb{H^n}$.Since $U$ is open in $\mathbb{R^n}$, there exists $r \gt 0$ such that $B_{d}(\vec{x},r) \subset U$.  Let $\vec{y}=(y_1,y')\in \mathbb{H^n} \cap B_{d}(\vec{x},r) $ such that $y_1 \lt 0$.   $z=(-y_1,y') \in B_{d}(\vec{x},r) $ but $z \not \in B_d(\vec{x},r) \cap \mathbb{H^n}$.  I believe this should lead to a contradiction at the point $x$. For some reason I am unable to see it. For the other side since $ U$ is open in $\mathbb{H^n}$, $U$ can be written as some $V \cap \mathbb{H^n}$, where $V$ is open in $\mathbb{R^n}$. Since  $U \cap \partial\mathbb{H^n}=\phi$  , we  have $V \cap \partial\mathbb{H^n}=\phi$.Thus $V \subset \mathbb{H^n}$. Thus $U=V$. Is this part alright?

1222346,"""Direct sums of injective modules over Noetherian ring is injective"" and its analogue",I have a commutative algebra class and I heard the theorem from the professor: Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $\{E_i : i\in I\}$ be a collection of injective $R$-modules then $\bigoplus_{i\in I} E_i$ is also injective. My questions are: How to prove that? My professor does not talk about the proof of it (just states the theorem.) I asked to professor where I can find the proof and she asks that I might find the proof of it in some homological algebra textbook. However I can't find that. Does the following analogue of above theorem hold? Let $R$ be an Artinian ring and $\{P_i : i\in I\}$ be a collection of projective $R$-modules then $\prod_{i\in I} P_i$ is also projective. If $R$ is domain then $R$ is field so the theorem holds trivially.

1222382,"What is a group action, and how can we apply it to Sylow theory","I am studying Sylow theorems at the moment, more specifically trying to solve the following problem that I recently posted: Let G be a finite group which has exactly eight Sylow 7 subgroups. Show that there exits a normal subgroup N of G such that the index [G:N] is divisible by 56 but not by 49 The link is here: If we have exactly 1 eight Sylow 7 subgroups, Show that there exits a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ s.t. the index $[G:N]$ is divisible by 56 but not 49. My initial response was to use Sylow's theorems to understand the order of the group. Though I am still very new at this. I was then told to look at this problem through group actions, which I know considerably less in. After taking a look at group actions again, I know just a few more things. Considering that I am just beginning at understanding this theory, I was wondering if someone can explain to me in laymen terms, the application of group actions and how to use them to solve problems. Of course, I know that I could just look up book definition, but I would like a little more insight than that. 
How would you explain group actions to someone with just calculus level knowledge maybe? What is the meaning of group actions, using language that is easy for a beginner to understand? The definition of group action that I have found comes from Hungerford's Algebra. An action of a group $G$ on a set $S$ is a function $GxS \to S$ such that for all $x \in S$ and $g_1, g_2 \in G$: $ex=x$ and $(g_1g_2)x=g_1(g_2x)$","['abstract-algebra', 'sylow-theory', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"
1222395,Stuck on crucial step while computing $\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} e^{-t^2}dt$,"This is a not mandatory exercise I am struggling with from my Analysis II Class, at the very end of it I am supposed to compute $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-t^2}dt \tag{*}$$
The most famous way to do that is switch to polar coordinates but I am not supposed to do it that way, one of my tutors even called it a 'dirty trick'. Instead the exercise gives us the following two Integrals to work with: $$F(x)= \int_0^1 \frac{e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}}{1+t^2}dt \text{ and } G(x)= \left( \int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt\right)^2, \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R} $$ I yet fail to see how these two integrals relate to (*) but I can naively follow the instructions given by exercise sheet and hope that the result will follow: Problem : Show that $F,G$ are of Class $C^1(\mathbb{R})$, compute $F',G'$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and show that $F+G$ is constant My approach : There isn't much to do really rather than to quote some Lemmas, clearly the parametric integral $F$ is of class $C^1$ because $f(x,t): \mathbb{R} \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,t)=e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}/(1+t^2)$ is of class $C^1$, I can therefore switch the partial derivative with the integral and obtain that  $$F'(x) =-2 x \int_0^1e^{-x^2(1+t^2)}dt$$ I doubt that I can further simplify this integral. With a little help of the fundamental theorem of Calculus one obtains that $$G'(x)= 2 \left( \int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt\right)e^{-x^2} $$ At this point I hope that the exercise (or my computation) is flawed, at least the limit points of the integrals because I wouldn't know how to show that $F'+G'=0$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$ to conclude that $F+G$ is constant. The only sense I could make out of $F'$ would be if I integrated it with respect to $x$ rather to $t$. Are there any further simplifications I can do?","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'integration']"

1222594,"Expectation of an increasing, bounded concave function of a non-negative random variable","Let $h:[0,\infty)\to [0,1)$ be a strictly increasing and strictly concave function. Let the argument of this function be a random variable $C$ with probability density function (pdf) $f_{C}(c)$ with support on some subset of $[0,\infty)$. By an application of Jensen's inequality, we have $$\mathrm{E}(h(C)) = \int_{0}^{\infty}h(c)f_{C}(c)dc < h\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}cf_{C}(c)dc\right) = h(\mathrm{E}(C))$$
where the expectations are assumed to exist. I wonder if this can be generalized as outlined below when the function $h$ is defined as above. Assume that we have two random variables $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ for which $\mathrm{E}(C_{1}) = \mathrm{E}(C_{2})$, but the higher moments of their distributions $f_{C_{1}}$ and $f_{C_{2}}$ differ in general. In particular, we may take $\mathrm{Var}(C_{2})>\mathrm{Var}(C_{1})$. Can anything be said about which quantity is larger in this case, $\mathrm{E}(h(C_{1}))$ or $\mathrm{E}(h(C_{2}))$? Intuitively, since $h$ is concave and increasing, I expect $\mathrm{E}(h(C_{2})) < \mathrm{E}(h(C_{1}))$ (the variable with the largest variance produces the smallest expectation), and certainly if $f_{C_{1}}$ and $f_{C_{2}}$ are both symmetric. But does this hold in general? I would be a little surprised if it does, but I haven't been able to find a simple counterexample.","['probability', 'convex-analysis']"

Croom. Prove that $A = (\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{R})\cup (\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{Q})$ is a locally connected and connected subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ This is what I understand: A space $X$ is connected provided that it cannot be written as the disjoint union of specifically two open sets. A space $X$ is locally connected at a point $a$ in $X$ if every open set containing $a$ contains a connected open set which contains $a$. The space $X$ is locally connected provided that it is locally connected at each point. I'm aware that neither connected nor locally connected implies the other, nor do their negations. Meaning I would have to prove each. Now the set of rationals is disconnected (in fact totally disconnected). $\mathbb{R}^2$ is connected and locally connected. $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ I'm a little stuck on how to approach this question; however, I do have a rough idea. To prove $A$ is connected, I can claim that $A$ is disconnected. Then there exists two nonempty set $U$ and $V$ such that $U\cup V=A$ and $U \cap V = \emptyset$. Thus $U$ and $V$ are clopen. Eventually, I should arrive at a contradiction because $\emptyset$ and $A$ are the only subsets of $A$ that are clopen, proving $A$ is connected. However I am not sure how to properly execute the approach. To prove $A$ is locally connected. I can claim the space $A$ has a local basis $\mathscr{B}_a$. I would need to prove that $\mathscr{B}_a$ consist of connected open sets, proving $A$ is locally connected. Am I on the right track? Any suggestions oh how I can proceed with my ideas?

1222768,Why are vector valued functions 'well-defined' when multivalued functions aren't?,"I'm looking for an 'intuitive' answer here, because I have no formal mathematical training but find myself in a comparatively math-heavy PhD (visual perception; lots of neuroscientists on the one side and CS folk on the other). Only functions which map some number of inputs to a single output are considered 'true' or 'well-defined' functions. I've seen squaring (and presumably other exponents) given as an example: [any number] squared produces a single 'output', though some outputs for different inputs may be the same: e.g. -2 and 2 squared both equal 4. By contrast, I've seen square-root given as an example of a NON -'well-defined' function, because sqrt(4) can equal both 2 and -2. A single input maps to multiple outputs, violating the definition of a 'true' function. (EDIT: As @Eff says in the comments, this is an incorrect example because sqrt(4) is in fact defined to equal 2 alone. But I hope my broader point is still clear) Presumably, the benefits of 'true' functions as defined by this constraint come in terms of assumptions one can make, and guarantees one can rely on when reasoning about the function. Vector-valued functions return multiple scalar values (organised within a tuple) and considering my programmer background I can't see how this differs, except in terminology, from a multivalued function. Yet I have never read anybody suggesting vector-valued functions aren't true functions. As it stands, if I were faced with the task of inverting a function which takes multiple inputs, I'd simply define the inverse as vector-valued, to sidestep the constraint. My sqrt(4) would be the tuple (2,-2). From a software engineering perspective, even in C where functions may return no more than one argument, that argument could be an array or a struct. It feels like either both or neither of multivalued and vector-valued functions meet the definition of being 'well-defined' / 'true' functions.

1222928,"How to reason about the combinatorial term ""$n$ choose $k$"" (i.e., $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$)","The combinatorial number is the number of picking $k$ unordered outcomes out of $n$ possible choices. In that setting, we have a set $A$ with $|A|=n$ and the combinatorial numbers is just really the number of subsets $S\subset A$ with $|S| = k$. This number is $$\binom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},$$ but how can we reason about this? How can we derive this formula? I've seem some people reasoning about this in the following way: the number of ways to choose permutations with size $k$ among $n$ objects is $$n(n-1)\cdots (n-k-1) = \dfrac{n(n-1)\cdots (n-k+1)(n-k)\cdots 1}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdots 1} = \dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!},$$ then we have to divide by $k!$ to disconsider the order.

It just converges uniformly on every compact interval $[\epsilon,1]$, but$f_n(0)=n$ tends to $+\infty$ and we can not use replacement of limit and integral with this reasoning. So, the other useful method to handle limit of integrals, is Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem .
But I can't still find the proper dominating nonnegative and measureble function over $[0,1]$ for the sequence $\{f_n\}$. First it seems the term $\cos x$ doesn't have impact on the result. Then for each $p<1$, there's natural $m$ that $f_m(x)$ is not dominated by $g(x)=\frac{1}{x^p}$ on the whole interval. (I observed it via plotting).

For example (courtesy of wikipedia), in a group, $G$, for each $g,h \in G$, the commutator of $g$ and $h$, $[g,h]$ is defined by,
$$[g,h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$$ ""the term associator is used in different ways as a measure of the nonassociativity of an algebraic structure"" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associator ). For example (thanks wikipedia!), for a nonassociative ring or algebra $R$, the associator is the multilinear map $[\cdot,\cdot,\cdot] : R \times R \times R \to R$ given by,
$$[x,y,z] = (xy)z-x(yz)$$ Comment: I was expecting to find an analog to the associator and commutator for the property of distributivity. I've failed to find such an analog on wikipedia and via google searches. This lack of information gives me a sad face. Question: My question is, does an established analog to the (concept of the) associator and commutator exist for the property of distributivity? If so are there any good sources of information on it and its use? In certain situations we can define an operator that measures the degree to which one binary operation fails to be (left/right) distributive over another and call it the (left/right) distributor. For example suppose $(S,+,\times)$ is an algebraic structure such that $(S,+)$ is an abelian group and $(S,\times)$ is a semigroup. Then we can define the left distributor, $\mathrm{Ldis} : S \times S \times S \to S$, by
$$\mathrm{Ldis}(x,y,z) = xy+xz - x(y+z)$$
Similarly we can define the right distributor, $\mathrm{Rdis} : S \times S \times S \to S$, by
$$\mathrm{Rdis}(x,y,z) = yx+zx-(y+z)x$$
where, as per usual, $-$ is used to denote additive inverse, juxtaposition is used in place of $\times$, and $\times$ has higher precedence than $+$. In the case that $\times$ is commutative, $\mathrm{Ldis} = \mathrm{Rdis}$, and we can define the distributor, $\mathrm{dis}$, by setting it equal to the left or right distributor. Example: In any ring we have,
$$\mathrm{dis}(x,y,z) = 0$$ Example: In any wheel algebra we have,
$$\mathrm{dis}(x,y,z) = 0x$$ Side question: Can anyone think of any other structures with a distributor-like operator satisfying an identity which does not force said structure to be trivial?

1223725,"For each irrational number $b$, does there exist an irrational number $a$ such that $a^b$ is rational?","It is well known that there exist two irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational. By the way, I've been interested in the following two propositions. Proposition 1 : For each irrational number $a\gt 0$ , there exists an irrational number $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational. Proposition 2 : For each irrational number $b$ , there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^b$ is rational. I got the following : Proposition 1 is true. Suppose that both $\frac{\ln 2}{\ln a}$ and $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln a}$ are rational. There exists a set of four non-zero integers $(m_1,m_2,n_1,n_2)$ such that $\frac{\ln 2}{\ln a}=\frac{n_1}{m_1}$ and $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln a}=\frac{n_2}{m_2}$ . Since one has $a=2^{m_1/n_1}=3^{m_2/n_2}$ , one has $2^{m_1n_2}=3^{m_2n_1}$ . This is a contradiction. It follows that either $\frac{\ln 2}{\ln a}$ or $\frac{\ln 3}{\ln a}$ is irrational. Hence, either setting $b=\frac{\ln 2}{\ln a}$ or setting $b=\frac{\ln 3}{\ln a}$ works. Then, I began to consider if proposition 2 is true. To prove that proposition 2 is true, it is sufficient to show that for each irrational number $b$ , there exists a rational number $c$ such that $c^{1/b}$ is irrational. This seems true, but I have not been able to prove that. So, my question is the following : Question : Is proposition 2 true? If yes , how can we show that? If no , what is a counterexample? Proposition 2 : For each irrational number $b$ , there exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^b$ is rational.","['rational-numbers', 'number-theory', 'irrational-numbers', 'exponentiation']"

This is that problem: In a rectangle ABCD , point B is joined to the points P and Q on the sides AD and DC respectively. And P and Q are joined to form three distinct triangle; namely PDQ or x , QCB or y , BAP or z and BPQ or f . Given the area of x = 3m^2 , y = 4m^2 and z = 5m^2 , find the area of f . Note: all the information regarding this problem has been provided. The dimensions of any of the line segments are not known . This also means that the exact positions of P and Q on their respective line segments are also not known . Because of the lack of information (See Note ), my tutor declared it as an incomplete problem (he is just a high-school Science and Mathematics teacher, please don’t expect him to think beyond the limits of a typical high-school student, that is, in case he is wrong). After a few hours of brainstorming, I came up with what I called an ingenious method . But then I felt that my method actually was not accurate. So, can anybody tell me if this problem is complete and solvable, if yes, is my method correct (see below), if no, what is the best/better method to solve it. MY METHOD: As all the triangles with their areas given are on the edge of the rectangle, we know that they all are right triangles . So we can say that one of the arms of the right angle is the altitude and the other is the base . Now, we can use the formula (1/2) * base * altitude to calculate their areas. Lets take a as altitude and b as base . (Here’s the first part of the trick ) We now try all possible _a_s and _b_s for the three triangles, where a and b are natural numbers only . (This is also where the major weakness of my method is. More numbers, i.e., any real numbers should have been tried, but that is infeasible). Note that all possible values are those values that form a triangle of that specified area. For triangle x , we have the following dimensions: - a = 1 , b = 6 - a = 2 , b = 3 - a = 3 , b = 2 - a = 6 , b = 1 # For triangle y , we have the following dimensions: - a = 1 , b = 8 - a = 2 , b = 4 - a = 4 , b = 2 #
  - a = 8 , b = 1 For triangle z , we have the following dimensions: - a = 1 , b = 10 - a = 2 , b = 5 - a = 5 , b = 2 - a = 10 , b = 1 # (Here’s the other part of the trick) Then, we select those specific dimensions of triangles, which when placed together form a rectangle. The condition we require: When the triangles are placed together to form a quadrilateral the opposite sides of it must be equal. If this quadrilateral’s opposite sides are equal, we know that it is a parallelogram . And as all of the triangles that form the edges are right angled , we have at least one of the angles of the parallelogram right angled_, so we know that this parallelogram is a rectangle . The correct set of dimensions (that we will be using here) are high-lighted in bold, while the once suffixed with a ‘#’ can also be used. So, in triangle x we take PD as altitude and DQ as base.
  In triangle y we take BC as altitude and CQ as base.
  In triangle z we take PA as altitude and AB as base. Henceforth, we now have: (PA + PD) = BC (DQ + CQ) = AB Therefore, the condition is matched. WE NOW HAVE THE CORRECT DIMENSIONS OF THE THREE TRIANGLES Now we can either find the area of f by finding the area of the rectangle and subtracting it by the areas of the three triangles, or by finding the three triangle’s hypotenuse using the Pythagorean formula and then apply the _Herron’s formula _on the hypotenuses. I prefer the former. > After calculating, we have, _f = 8m^2_ Thank you =)","['area', 'geometry', 'triangles', 'rectangles', 'packing-problem']"

  $\mathscr L_{\mathbb k} (D)$ is a $\mathbb k$-vector subspace of
  $\mathscr L_{\mathbb k} (D + P_0)$. Let $t \in k(C)^∗$ be a function
  such that $v_{P_0} (f) = n_{P_0} + 1$ (e.g., take $t$ to be a power of

Edit: I guess if I take a very ugly function such as the indicator function that is $1$ if and only if $x$ is rational, this may not hold. (In that case, let $x$ be any rational number. Whatever $g(x)$, the set $[g(x),\infty)$ has positive Lebesgue measure, but its pre-image wrt $g$ is countable.) But what about if I only need the properties to hold almost everywhere? Specifically, if the order condition holds except on a set of measure zero, if $\textsf{Im}(g)=\mathbb{R}$ up to a set of measure zero and $g^{-1}(z)$ has measure zero for all $z\in[0,1]$? Proof idea: Here's my original intuition for what could work, but I'm not confident all arguments are sound.
Let $h$ correspond to some probability measure over $\mathbb{R}$ that has full support (by which I mean, if $h(A)=0$, then the set $A$ has Lebesgue measure zero - should I rather call this absolutely continuous?) and admits a distribution function $H$. Then let 
$$g(x)=H^{-1}(1-h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))-h(f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})\cap(x,\infty)).$$ Furthermore, let $$A=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\left\{\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\mid 0\leq m<n\text{ and }h\left(f^{-1}\left(\frac{m}{n},\frac{m+1}{n}\right)\right)=0\right\}.$$ Since $f^{-1}(A)$ can be written as a countable union of inverse images with zero measure each, it follows that $h(f^{-1}(A))=0$. In that case, $f(x)<f(y)$ with $x,y\notin f^{-1}(A)$ implies $(f(x),\infty)\supseteq(f(y),\infty)\cup (\{f(y)\}\cap(x,\infty))\cup (f(x),f(y))$ and the inverse image of the last part of this disjoint union has nonzero measure by definition of $A$. This implies $g(x)<g(y)$, establishing the desired order condition. As for bijectivity, let $z\in \mathbb{R}$. I want to show $h(g^{-1}(z))=0$. By the above, all points in $g^{-1}(z)\setminus A$ share a common function value $f(z)$. Let $(a,b)$ be the infimum and the maximum of $g^{-1}(z)$ respectively. By the definition of $g(\cdot)$, it must hold that $h(g^{-1}(z))\leq h(f^{-1}({f(z)})\cap(a,b))=0$. This establishes my notion of ""almost everywhere injective"". Lastly, for surjectivity, let $k=H^{-1}(y)$ for any $y\in\mathbb{R}$. Set $z=\inf\{f(x)\mid h(f^{-1}((f(x),\infty)))<k\}$. Either $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))=k$ and $h(f^{-1}(\{z\}))=0$, or $h(f^{-1}((z,\infty)))>k$. Either way, there exists $x\in f^{-1}(\{z\})$ such that $g(x)=H^{-1}(k)$. Does this sound plausible? Shouldn't there be a much more simple approach to prove this intuitive result?","['lebesgue-measure', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'reference-request']"
1224134,Stuggling to understand ideal powers,"In my current algebraic number theory course we have defined the multiplication of 2 ideals as the smallest ideal containing all products of elements of both, [i.e: let I and J be ideals of a ring R, then

However, using the first, informal definition, it seems to me that all products of elements from I will just again form I i.e. using the formal definition, and taking x = 2 I find that $I^2$ = II = {$\sum_i^k a_ib_i : a_i\in I , b_i\in I$} = {$\sum_1^k c_i : c_i\in I$} = {$d : d\in I$} = I and clearly extending this definition to higher powers results in the same thing?

1224146,Showing that poset of set of supports of a vector space is semimodular,"Let $W$ be a subspace of the vector space $\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is a field of characteristic $0$. The support of a vector $v = (v_1,\ldots, v_n) \in \mathbb{K}^n$ is given by $\text{supp}(v) = \left\{i : v_i\neq 0\right\}$. Let $L$ denote the set of supports of all vectors in $W$, ordered by reverse inclusion. I want to show that $L$ is a semimodular lattice. By Proposition 3.3.2 in Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics, vol. 1, we can either show that $L$ is graded (every maximal chain has the same length) and that its rank functions $\rho:L\rightarrow \left\{0,1,\ldots, n \right\}$ satisfies
$$ \rho(s)+\rho(t) \geq \rho(s\wedge t)+\rho(s\vee t)$$ for any $s,t \in L$ or we can show that if $s$ and $t$ both cover $s\wedge t$, then $s\vee t$ covers both $s$ and $t$. Here's the problem...I know that the meet of any $s,t \in L$ is $s\cup t$, but I don't know what the join is. Ultimately what I'm trying to show is the $L$ is a geometric lattice, which requires showing that $L$ is semimodular. Perhaps there is a better way of proving this.","['field-theory', 'order-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'lattice-orders', 'combinatorics']"
1224150,Isomorphism from $\mathbb{C}[G]$ to $\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$.,"What I want to ask is the proof of the Proposition 10. in ""Linear Representations of Finite Groups"" by Jean-Pierre Serre. Let $\rho_i : G \rightarrow GL(W_i)$ be the distinct irreducible representations of $G$.$(1 \le i \le h)$
We can extend $\rho_i$ to $\widetilde{\rho_i} : \mathbb{C}[G] \rightarrow \text{End}(W_i)$ by $\widetilde{\rho_i}(\sum_{g \in G} a_g g) = a_g \sum_{g \in G} \rho_i(g)$. Then $\widetilde{\rho} = (\widetilde{\rho_i}) : \mathbb{C}[G] \rightarrow \prod_{i=1}^{h} \text{End}(W_i) \cong \prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ is a homomorphism. Then Proposition 10 states that it is an isomorphism. 
Since dimensions of domain and codomain are same, it suffices to show that $\widetilde{\rho}$ is surjective. In the proof of the book, If $\widetilde{\rho}$ is not surjective, then there exists a nonzero linear form on $\prod M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$ vanishing on the image of $\widetilde{\rho}$.
This gives a nontrivial relation on the coefficients of the representations $\rho_i$ which is impossible because of the orthogonality formulas of 2.2. But I can not follow the above three lines in the proof. I will appreciate it if you give an explanation for the proof. Thank you.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'representation-theory']"

1224168,Is fibonacci sequence a member of more broad family of sequences?,"Yesterday, I was pondering on the Fibonacci sequence and  I started to discover some features of it that were previously unknown to me.
Such as, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 .... 1 ) The nth element of the sequence is the sum-1 of first n-2 elements.
2) If you multiply the first number with one and the second one with the two and sum them, you would get the fibonacci number, after the next element of the sequence.
For example, 1x1 + 1x2 =  3.
3x1 + 5x2 = 13.
5x1 + 8x2 = 21.
and so on.
What is more, if I do this for another subsequent (5, 8 or 2, 3) fibonacci numbers I would get another Fibonacci number but in this case, I would not skip one element, instead, I would skip 'x' times where 'x' is equal to the index of the first occurence of the subsequent numbers. For example,
3x5 + 5x8 = 55, normally we would get the next element, if the second operands would be one but in this case we get the 4th element after the next fibonacci number. It amazed me and I asked to myself, if there was any other such sequence. Then I realized that, any sequence generated by random two number has the same property.
For example,
suppose that the first two numbers in my sequence are 3 and 4.
I will generate the next element of the sequence by multiplying the previous one with 3, the current one with 4 and summing those two results. Following happens, 3, 4, 25, 112, 523 ... And this series also satisfies the second property mentioned above. So, my question is, Do all this sort of sequences have another name which refers to that abstraction? 
OR is this property trivial?","['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

1224201,Derive the equation of first variation for a flow of a vector field.,"This is a problem from Susan Colley's Vector Calculus. I have trouble understanding the solution to it. Problem: Derive the equation of first variation for a flow of a vector field. That is, if $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field of class $C^1$ with flow $\phi$ of class $C^2$, show that $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}D_{\mathbf{x}}\phi(\mathbf{x},t)=D\mathbf{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x},t))D_{\mathbf{x}}\phi(\mathbf{x},t).$$ Here the expression ""$D_{\mathbf{x}}\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$"" means to differentiate $\phi$ with respect to the variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n,$ that is, by holding $t$ fixed. Solution: By definition of a flow of $\mathbf{F}$, we know that $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi(\mathbf{x},t)=\mathbf{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x},t))$. So 
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}D_{\mathbf{x}}\phi(\mathbf{x},t)=D_\mathbf{x}(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi(\mathbf{x},t))=D_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x},t)).$$ Now by the Chain Rule, 
$$D_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x},t))=D\mathbf{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x},t))D_{\mathbf{x}}\phi(\mathbf{x},t).$$ I don't understand the two equations shown in the solution. First, how can we interchange $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and $D_{\mathbf{x}}$ in the first equation? Also, I don't understand how the Chain Rule leads to the second equation, since we're trying to get $D_\mathbf{x}\mathbf{F}$, not $D\mathbf{F}$. This seems to suggest that $D_\mathbf{x}\mathbf{F}$ is just the matrix of $D\mathbf{F}$ with the first $n$ columns. That is, the partials with respect to the variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$. This result confuses me. How does this result make sense starting from the definition of the expression $D_{\mathbf{x}}$ given in the problem? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could explain the above questions to me.","['vectors', 'vector-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus']"
1224207,Intuition about $v\otimes w$,"In Physics and Differential Geometry usually tensors of type $(k,l)$ on a vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{F}$ are defined as multilinear functions $$f : \underbrace{V\times\cdots\times V}_{k \ \mathrm{terms}}\times\underbrace{V^\ast\times\cdots\times V^\ast}_{l \ \mathrm{terms}}\to\mathbb{F}$$ this makes it quite simple to gather some understanding of $(k,0)$ tensors from one intuitive point of view. They are just $k$-linear functions of vectors and can be used like linear functions of vectors or like inner products and so on. Also it is not hard to see why one would care about these. Now, on the other hand, tensors of type $(0,l)$ also appear in Physics quite frequently. Indeed Maxwell's Stress Tensor is: $$\mathcal T
=
\epsilon_0\left[
\mathbf{E}\otimes\mathbf{E}+c^2\mathbf{B}\otimes\mathbf{B}
-\frac12\sum_i\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i\left(E^2+c^2 B^2\right)
\right].$$ Those objects are not much intuitive IMHO. First, a tensor of type $(0,l)$ is a function of linear functionals in this approach, and this makes it a little bit harder to make sense from a physical and geometrical point of view. The other possible approach to tensors is the one based on the universal property. As far as I understand, the basic idea of this approach is that in the end the construction (with quotient spaces and so on) shows that there exists a way to make sense of the product $v_1\otimes\cdots \otimes v_k$ and that it has all the nice properties we would want. In that case, a tensor of type $(0,l)$ as defined above is an element of $V\otimes\cdots\otimes V$. Of course to understand those objects, it suffices to understand for $v,w\in V$ how $v\otimes w$ can be understood. So my question is: I know the constructions are isomorphic and I know from a rigorous point of view what $v\otimes w$ is, now how can one intuitively make sense of $v\otimes w$? Again, thinking of it as a function of linear functionals doesn't seem much intuitive. So, just regarding it as an element of $V\otimes V$ how can we give to it some geometric and physical intuition? The object $v\wedge w \in V\wedge V$ has one nice way to be understood: it can be thought of as the paralelogram generated by $v$ and $w$, that is one oriented area in the same way as $v$ and $w$ are oriented segments. Now, is there a nice way to understand $v\otimes w$ too?","['vector-spaces', 'tensor-products', 'intuition', 'linear-algebra', 'tensors']"
