327932,Why can infinite product only be zero if one of the factors is zero?,"I was reading about the Riemann zeta function in the region $Re(Z) > 1$, where
it can be represented by the Euler product formula. And the book mentioned that
there can be no zeros in this region, since each factor  $1/(1 - 1/p^s)$ is never zero. Can someone explain why the product can't converge to zero? For example, 
consider the infinite product $1/2 \cdot 1/3 \cdot 1/4 \cdots$.  This seems to converge to zero,
but each factor is not zero. Thanks!","['infinite-product', 'complex-analysis']"
327995,Problem with infinite product using iterating of a function: $ \exp(x) = x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) \cdot \ldots $,"[update]: I made the question more precise, more general and added a follow up question Considering the iteration of functions (with focus on the iterated exponentiation) I'm looking, whether some function which I want to iterate can -hopefully with some advantage- itself be expressed by iterations of a -so to say- ""more basic"" function. Fo example I assume a function $f(x)$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle \exp(x) =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ $\qquad \qquad$ (where the circle-notation means iteration, and $f^{\circ 0}=x, f^{\circ 1}(x)=f(x)$) and first I ask: what does this function $f(x)$ look like? What I'm doing is this substitution:
$$ \small \begin{array} {lrll}
1.& \exp(x) & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\
2.& \exp(f(x))&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\   \\  \\
3.& {\exp(f(x))\over \exp(x) } & = & \frac 1x \\ \\
& \exp(f(x)) & = & &{ \exp(x) \over x} \\ \\ \\ 
4. & f(x)&=& x & - \log(x) \end{array} $$
$ \qquad \qquad $ (From 1. and 4. I know, that x is now restricted to $x \gt 0$) As some comments point out, the construction of the function $f(x)$ is underdetermined; so in step $3.$ numerator and denominator can have a common factor $c$ such that we'll have $$ \small \begin{array} {lrll}
1a.& \exp(x)\cdot c & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\
2a.& \exp(f(x)) \cdot c&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots   \end{array} $$ If I do now the computation with some example $x$ by 
$$ y =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots $$
I get for all tested $x>0$ the result
$$ y = \exp(x) / \exp(1)  $$
such that indeed a cofactor $c$ occurs and that it is precisely $1 / \exp(1)$ Q1: Where does this additional factor in the empirical evaluation come from? Where have the above analytical steps missed some crucial information? The question can made more precise: Q2: How does the empiricial computation determine, that the cofactor $c$ is just $1/\exp(1)$ ? (The comments of @Eric Wong adress this questions, but I've not yet made it explicite) In reviewing my own question, a generalization is possible in that I can use any base $b$ with $\log(b)\ge 1$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle {b^x \over b} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ and the constant $c$ comes always out to equal $1/b$ such that we might as well  write $ \qquad \displaystyle b^{x-1} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ Q3: Can Eric's comment made be more explicite such that it shall work for all that bases? I observe, that for $\eta < \log(b) <1$ with $\eta \lt 0.39996 $ the sequence of iterates of the functions $f_b(x)$ either approach $1$ alternating from below and above or don't approach $1$ at all but approach distinct accumulation-points... That observation is important here, because for such bases $b$ the above productformula does not work correctly, because we get sometimes no convergence to a single fixpoint. But due to the remark of @did I moved that question into a separate thread A code snippet using Pari/GP: f(x) = x-log(x)  \\ define the function 

x0=1.5
     \\  = 1.50000000000
[tmp=x0,pr=1]              \\ initialize
for(k=1,64,pr *= tmp;tmp = f(tmp));   pr   \\ compute 64 terms, show result
      \\ = 1.64872127070

exp(x0)        \\ show expected value
       \\ = 4.48168907034

pr*exp(1)      \\ show, how it matches
       \\  = 4.48168907034 Here is an example which shows the type of convergence; I use $x_0=1.5$ and internal precision of 200 decimal digits. Then we get the terms of the partial product as

328014,Singularities of Curves in Positive Characteristic,"Given a collection of polynomials $\mathscr{F}\subset\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, we can associate to each prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ an affine variety as follows:
$$
(p)\longmapsto Z(\mathscr{F})\subset\mathbb{A}^n_{k}
$$
where $k=\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$ (in the case of $p=0$, define $\mathbb{F}_0:=\mathbb{Q}$).  Under this association, which prime ideals $(p)$ correspond to singular varieties? This question is motivated by exercise I$.5.1$ in Hartshorne.  Part $(c)$ of the exercise asks us to find the singular points of the curve $X$ defined by $x^3=y^2+x^4+y^4$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$.  Having done this exercise I've found that if char $k=0$, then $(0,0)$ is the only singular point of $X$, whereas for characteristics $2$,$7$, and $13$, the curve has other singular points (you can check my result if you'd like; the exercise excludes characteristic $2$, but I've included this case anyway). Finding the extra singular points and their characteristics involved a fair deal of computing Jacobians and solving simultaneous equations.  Is there another way to find the characteristics which give extra singular points? I guess this is really a question about the existence of solutions to a system of polynomial equations mod $p$.  In the case of a plane curve, defined by $f(x,y)=0$, we want to know in which characteristics the system of equations
$$
f(x,y)=0
$$
$$
\partial_xf(x,y)=0

\partial_yf(x,y)=0

A Regge symmetry generates a new tetrahedron by transforming the dihedral angles of the original. One such symmetry has this effect: $$\left(a,\frac{-b+c+b^\prime+c^\prime}{2},\frac{b-c+b^\prime+c^\prime}{2}, a^\prime, \frac{b+c-b^\prime+c^\prime}{2}, \frac{b+c+b^\prime-c^\prime}{2}\right)$$ (Regge-symmetric tetrahedra are interesting (to me) because they have the same volume. In fact, any two Regge-symmetric tetrahedra are scissors congruent : you can cut one into polyhedra that re-assemble to form the other.)

Where may I find confirmation (or refutation) of my belief?

For an example of what I mean by ""more direct,"" say I wanted all conjugates of some $g\in G$.  I could check each $g^\prime \in G$ to see if there exists an $x$ so that $g^\prime=g^x$, but it would be much easier to just compute $g^x$ for all $x\in G$ (or all $x$ in a transversal of $C_G(g)$ in $G$, if we have that information).

Motivation: I am running a computational experiment having to do with this problem (which is becoming somewhat of an obsession) that requires computing the complete partition of the set of normal subgroups of $G$ under $M\sim N \Leftrightarrow M\in \mathfrak{C}_N$.  If $M,N\unlhd G$ are related by an outer automorphism, then surely $M\sim N$, but converse is not necessarily true.

  and $\mathrm D_2\phi(x,y) = x^2$. We see that $\mathrm D_1\phi$ is not continuous at any point on the $y$-axis since cos(1/x) in $\mathrm D_1\phi(x,y)$ does not tend to a limit as $x\rightarrow 0$. Letting $c_1\neq 0$ and considering the open ball in $\mathbb R^2$ where $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<c_1$ (to make $x\neq -c_1$), we have
\begin{align}
\phi(c_1+x,c_2+y) &= \phi(c_1,c_2) + [\mathrm D_1\phi(c_1,c_2) \quad \mathrm D_2\phi(c_1,c_2)] \left[\begin{array}{c}x\\
y
\end{array}\right] + r(x,y)\\
(c_1+x)^2(c_2+y+\sin\frac{1}{c_1+x}) &= c_1^2(c_2+\sin\frac{1}{c_1}) + x(2c_1(c_2+\sin\frac{1}{c_1})-\cos\frac{1}{c_1})+yc_1^2+r(x,y).

Thus,
$$
r(x,y) = (c_1+x)^2(c_2+y+\sin\frac{1}{c_1+x}) - c_1^2(c_2+\sin\frac{1}{c_1})-x(2c_1(c_2+\sin\frac{1}{c_1})-\cos\frac{1}{c_1})-yc_1^2.

This can be done infinitely many times and the resulting sequence has $1$ at position $M \in \mathbb N$, no matter how large $M$ is. Thus $(a_n) = (1_n)$. Also, consider powerset of $\mathbb N, \ \ 2^{\mathbb N}$. Then form any permutation of these sets, $(b_{n_{\{N\}}})$. Now simply flatten this, take first element $b_1$ and make it first element of $a$ and continue till you come to end of the first set and then the next element in $a$ is the first element of $b_2$... But again, if you start with set $\{1 | k \in \mathbb N\}$ (infinite sequence of ones), you will get the same as in the first case... You would not be able to form a bijection between this sequence and a sequence that lists every natural number once, for if you started $(a_n)$ with listing every natural number once, you would be able to map only the first $\aleph_0$ elements of $(a_n)$ to $\mathbb N$.

328832,Are matrices best understood as linear maps?,"Any linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces may be represented by a matrix, and conversely. Matrix-matrix multiplication corresponds to map composition, and matrix-vector multiplication corresponds to map application. This provides a nice way of understanding matrices and the origin of the rules for their calculation. Having attained this perspective is a huge boon to me, because I've always resented that matrix math is basically just taught as a collection of arbitrary manipulations of symbols (multiply the entries! now add them! don't ask why! ). But is this understanding always meaningful? For in general, just because you've found an interpretation for a mathematical concept doesn't mean it will always apply. For instance, the trig functions can be thought of as simply being the coordinates on a unit circle, but this fails to explain why they show up as solutions to differential equations having nothing to do with circles (or indeed geometry) - to explain this we require a more abstract understanding of the trig functions. Thus, in all non-trivial uses of matrices in pure and applied mathematics, can we meaningfully say that the matrices involved represent, at least implicitly, linear maps? For instance, we can think of solving a system of equations as simply trying to find a vector which, when a given map is applied to it, yields a specific image. By non-trivial, I mean that the particular use of matrices involves, at minimum, matrix multiplication and/or determinants or other elementary aspects of the calculus of matrices. For instance, you could call a spreadsheet a matrix, but unless you intend to do anything matrix-like with it apart from draw it as a grid, you may as well just call it a set of numbers. Note: this question may be soft, but I feel it can be given a clean answer.

Prove that for any fixed integer $k>1$ the map from $G$ to itself defined by $z \to z^k$ is a surjective homomorphism, but is not an isomorphism. To show $\phi(z)=z^k$ is a homomorphism let $z_a=e^\frac{2\pi ia}{n}$ and $z_b=e^\frac{2\pi ib}{n}$ where $a,b\in \mathbb Z^+$ and $a\neq b$ then $\phi(z_az_b)=(e^\frac{2\pi ia}{n}$$\cdot$$e^\frac{2\pi ib}{n}$)=$e^\frac{2\pi ik(a+b)}{n}$=$e^\frac{2\pi ika}{n}$$\cdot$$e^\frac{2\pi ikb}{n}$=$\phi(z_a)\phi(z_b)$. I had what I thought was a proof for $\phi$ being surjective until I thought about this specific example. Here's the example: Suppose $z_a$ is a root of unity then so is a power $z^t_a$. My thoughts on $G$ are that it consists of all integer powers of the ""basic"" roots of unity for a partiuclar $n$. Let $n=3$ and $k=3$, then $\phi(e^\frac{2t\pi ik_i}{3})=(e^\frac{2t\pi ik_i}{3})^3 =e^{2t\pi ik_i}= 1$ for any integer $t\in \mathbb Z$ and integer $k_i$ such that $0\leq$$k_i$$\leq$ $2$. So we have $\phi[G]=\{1\}$, $\phi$ is not surjective in this instance. What have I misunderstood about the question? Are there any glaring errors I'm making?

Can some approximation be obtained by elementary methods? EDIT: If it is true that the sequence is monotone increasing, we get the estimates $-\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{n+\frac{1}{4}} \le a_n \le -\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{n+\frac{5}{4}}$, i.e. $a_n = -\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{n} + O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, but why is it monotone? EDIT2: Just to clarify the generating function part, note that $\exp(x+x^2/2)$ is the exponential generating function of the number of involutions and $\frac{\partial(\exp(tu+t^2/2))}{\partial u}|_{u=1} = t\exp(t+t^2/2)$ is the exponential generating function of $a_n \times b_n$ where $a_n$ is the number of involutions and $b_n$ the average of fixed points.

I'm reading this paper for my bachelor thesis and have problems with corrolary 3.3 on page 8. I tried to solve this problem for some time, asked on a different forum for help but the only advice i received was to contact the authors( it was a german forum and i marked the question as answered there, because no one was able to help me, in case there are rules against cross-postings here). I did that and got a very quick response which was something of a surprise for me. The reply consisted in the promise, that he would think about this problem and get back to me. The same thing sad my professor, who gave me the paper after i asked him today. First i will summarize everything which is needed to understand what's going on. For $f\in L^2$ with $\lVert f\rVert =1$ and $p>1$ define $\varphi_f:\ \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb R\ ;\ a\mapsto \int|t-a|^p|f(t)|^2\mathrm dt$, this Integral and all others without specified domain of integration are taken over $\mathbb R$ or the complement of a set of measure zero. The following properties hold for $\varphi_f$: if there is one $a_0\in\mathbb R$ with $\varphi_f(a_0)<\infty$, then i) $  \varphi_f(a)<\infty$ for every $a\in\mathbb R$ ii)$\varphi_f$ is stricly convex, continuous and satisfies $\lim\limits_{|a|\to\infty}\varphi_f=\infty$ iii)$\varphi_f$ has a unique minimum $\Delta_p^2(f)$ at the point $\mu_p(f)$ ( with $\Delta_p(f)\geq 0$). Now we can define the following set for $A>0$ and $p,q>1$: $K=\{f\in L^2:\ \|f\|=1,|\Delta_p(f)|\leq A, |\mu_p(f)|\leq A,|\Delta_q(\hat f)|\leq A,|\mu_q(\hat f)|\leq A\}$, where $\hat f$ is the Fourier transform of f. The authors claim without further justification that this set is closed and i wanted to proof this. Note that $\mu_p(\cdot),\ \Delta_p(\cdot)$ are not continuous, for a counterexample see page 4 of the paper just before proposition 2.2. That's how far i come: Let $f\in\overline K$, i.e. there is a sequence $(f_n)_n\in K^\mathbb N$ with $f_n\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{L^2}f$. Since $\Delta_p(f_n),\ \mu_p(f_n)\in[-A,A]$ for all $n$, there exists a subsequence with i)$\Delta_p(f_{n_k})\xrightarrow[k\to\infty]{}\underline\Delta_p=\liminf\Delta_p(f_n)\in[-A,A]$ ii)$\mu_p(f_{n_k})\xrightarrow[k\to\infty]{}\mu_p\in[-A,A]$. iii)Because $f_{n_k}\xrightarrow[k\to\infty]{L^2}f$ there exists another subsequence, which i will denote by $(f_{n_k})_k$ for convenience, that converges pointwise almost everywhere to f. That $\|f\|=1$ is easy to see and the lemma of Fatou implies $\varphi_f(\mu_p)=\int|t-\mu_p|^p|f|^2\mathrm d t=\int\liminf|t-\mu_p(f_{n_k})|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t$ $\leq\liminf\int|t-\mu_p(f_{n_k})|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t=\liminf\Delta_p^2(f_{n_k})=\lim\Delta_p^2(f_{n_k})=\underline\Delta_p^2\leq A^2$ This means $\varphi_f(\mu_p)<\infty$, so that $\Delta_p(f)$ and $\mu_p(f)$ are well defined, and since $\Delta_p^2(f)$ is the minimum of $\varphi_f$ it holds $\Delta_p^2(f)\leq\varphi_f(\mu_p)\leq A^2\Rightarrow  |\Delta_p(f)|\leq A$. The same argument can be applied to $\hat f$ (because the Fourier transform is an unitary operator on $L^2$), so $|\Delta_q(\hat f)|\leq A$ is also satisfied. My problem is to show that the inequality also holds for $\mu_p(f)$ and $\mu_q(\hat f)$. I tried to prove that for $a\notin [-A,A]$ it is $\varphi_f(\mu_p)\leq\varphi_f(a)$, because then $\varphi_f$ couldn't attain it's minimum outside of $[-A,A]$. One idea is to use the $\limsup$ version of Fatou's lemma, but for that i need an integrable majorant for $(|t-a|^p|f_{n_k}|)_k$ then one could argue just like before: $\varphi_f(\mu_p)\leq\liminf\int|t-\mu_p(f_{n_k})|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t\leq \liminf\int|t-a|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t$ the last inequality holds because $\mu_p(f_{n_k})$ is the point where the minimum of $\varphi_{f_{n_k}}$ is attained and thus $\liminf\int|t-a|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t\leq\limsup\int|t-a|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t$ $\leq\int\limsup|t-a|^p|f_{n_k}|^2\mathrm d t=\int|t-a|^p|f|^2\mathrm d t=\varphi_f(a)$.

Denote by $S(I)$ the subset in $F^n$ consisting of all $n$-tuples $(a_1,...,a_n)\in F^n$ such that $f(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ for all $f\in I$. A subset $S\subset F^n$ is called closed if there exists an ideal $I$ (of $F[X_1,...,X_n]$ such that $S=S(I)$. Prove that the union of any two closed sets is closed. Here is my attempt: First: I claim that if $S$ is closed then I can find an $I$ such that it is generated by one element and $S(I)=S$. Proof: By definition of closed we know there is a $J$ such that $S=S(J)$. Since our ring is Noetherian we know that $J$ is f.g. so $J=\langle f_1,..,f_k\rangle$. Let $h=\gcd(f_i)$. I claim that $I=\langle h\rangle $ works. If $(a_1,..,a_n)\in S$, then $f_i(a_1,..,a_n)=0$. Since $h=\sum \alpha_i f_i$ (Bezout), we just plug in $(a_1,...,a_n)$ at both sides and obtain that $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so indeed $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(I)$. For the reverse inclusion if $(a_1,..,a_n)\in S(I)$, then $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$. As $h\mid f_i$, we have that $f_i(a_1,...,a_n)=0$, so $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(J)$. Now using this fact, I will solve the question: Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be closed with $I_1=\langle f\rangle$ and $I_2=\langle g\rangle$  such that $S_1=S(I_1)$, and $S_2=S(I_2)$. Then let $h=$lcm$ (f,g)$. Then we have that $S(\langle h\rangle)$ works. If $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1\cup S_2$, then either $f(a_1,...,a_n)$ or $g(a_1,...a_n)=0$ (wlog say the first case happens). Then since $f\mid h$ then $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S(\langle h\rangle)$. For the other inclusion just note that if $h(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ then eithe $f(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ or $g(a_1,...,a_n)=0$ (because otherwise we would have $fg(a_1,....,a_n)\neq 0$ and since $h\mid fg$ we would get a contradiction here) so we have that either $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_1$ or $(a_1,...,a_n)\in S_2$.

328965,Finding the order of the automorphism group of the abelian group of order 8.,"So I am given an abelian group of order $8$ such that for all non-identity elements $x^2 = e$ (all elements have order two). So I know the answer is gonna be $168$, but I gotta prove this. So far I have that there are exactly $7$ subgroups of order $4$, and each one has $6$ automorphisms. That gives me a total of $42$ automorphisms. Now there must be a justification for multiplying this number by $4$ to get the $168$. But I can't seem to find a justification for this.","['abelian-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
328972,Rigorous probability text for math major,"Most probability texts that do not use measure theory seemed to be geared toward engineers and the like, while more advanced texts already assume a strong background in measure theory and Lebesgue integration. I'm not too familiar with measure theory, (my analysis background is limited to Rudin's PMA Ch. 1 - 10), so I'd appreciate some recommendations that do not assume an analysis background beyond Rudin's PMA.  I'd be okay with a text that uses measure and Lebesgue theory as long as it sufficiently presents the material on its own. Thank you very much.","['reference-request', 'probability', 'analysis']"
328986,Which metrics induce the discrete topology?,"It is well known that the discrete metric induces the discrete topology.  One can tinker with this and get a great deal of metrics which induce the discrete topology. However, given a set equipped with the discrete topology, is there some general characterization of metrics which induce the topology? I suspect there's something along the lines of the metric being separated from $0$ as follows: ""For a metric space $(X,d)$, there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $d(x,y)\geq c$ for all $x,y\in X$ if and only if $d$ induces the discrete topology."" One direction (necessity) is trivial.  However, when I try to prove the other direction I always end up needing something like compactness somewhere, but that forces $X$ to have finite cardinality, and of course any metric on a set of finite cardinality induces the discrete topology. In any case, I'm not sure is what I put in quotes above is true or not, but does anyone know of a way to characterize metrics which induce the discrete topology?","['general-topology', 'geometry']"

328997,derivatives and constants,"I am confused on finding the derivative when constants are involved:
with $3\ln(x^4 + \sec x)$
the derivative is
$(3(4x^3 + \sec x \tan x))/(x^4+\sec x)$
notice the three stayed, but with $x^2+2x+7$
the derivative of seven turns to zero in the answer
$2(x+1)$ my question is what is the difference.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"
