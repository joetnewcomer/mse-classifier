531068,What's the average distance between two discs in the plane?,"Consider two discs in the plane of radius $r$ and $s$, with centers separated by a distance $l$.  If we choose a point uniformly at random from each disc, what is the expected distance between the two points?  (This is a generalization of this question .) Is there a simple closed-form solution?  Experimentally (via monte carlo), the answer is something like $2/3 \sqrt{r^2+s^2+(3l/2)^2}$. This has the right limiting properties, e.g. when $r,s \to 0$ or $l \to \infty$, we get simply $l$; and when $s=l=0$ we get $2r/3$, the average distance from the center of the disc, but is only approximately right when $r=s$, $l=0$, where we estimate $2\sqrt{2}/3 r \simeq 0.94 r$ compared to the exact result of $128r/45\pi \simeq 0.91 r$ for the average distance between two points in a single disc. Aside: Writing the experimental result as $\sqrt{(2r/3)^2+(2s/3)^2 + l^2}$ suggests a nice geometric motivation for it, in which we represent each disc as a ring with 2/3 the radius (so each ring has the same average distance from its center as the original disc).  Then we rotate each ring about its center and out of the plane to be perpendicular to the line connecting them (approximately preserving average distance between them).  Now estimate the average distance between the rings by taking a point on each with a phase difference equal to the expected average, namely $\pi/2$.  i.e. WLOG take one ring centered at the origin in the $yz$ plane, and the other centered at $(l,0,0)$, and approximate the average distance between them as the distance between the point $(0,2r/3,0)$ and $(l,0,2s/3)$, which yields the experimental result. Aside 2:  We can improve the approximation by considering the three error sources in the experimental formula: (1) rotating the discs out of the plane, (2) replacing the discs with rings, and (3) approximating the inter-ring distance by two points $\pi/2$ out of phase.  The second error underestimates, since the average self-distance in a unit disc is $128/45\pi \simeq 0.91$ whereas the average self-distance in our 2/3 ring is $8/3\pi \simeq 0.84$.  The third over-estimates, since the average self-distance in the unit ring is $4/\pi \simeq 1.27$ compared to the $\pi/2$ phase difference estimate of $\sqrt{2} \simeq 1.41$.  The product of these two leaves our estimate slightly high (ignoring the first error), so we can introduce a ""phase correction"" and instead estimate as $\sqrt{(2/3)^2(r^2+s^2-2rs \cos \phi) + l^2}$, choosing $\phi$ to make the $r=s$, $l=0$ case correct, namely $\cos \phi = 1 - (64/15\pi)^2/2 \simeq 0.0778$ or $\phi \simeq 0.95 \pi/2$.","['average', 'geometry', 'circles', 'geometric-probability']"

531119,Markov Chains Proof using Statistics,"Source: This came from ""Introduction to probability"" by Charles Miller Grinstead, and James Aurie Snell. It was located on page 407 and is Theorem 11.1 in the section 11.1 Introduction. Theorem: The Theorem 11.1 states: Let $P$ be the transition matrix of a Markov chain. The $ij$th entry $P_{ij}(n)$ of the matrix $P(n)$ gives the probability that the Markov chain, starting in the state $S_i$, will be in state $S_j$, after $n$ steps. Proof: You start with the probability distribution $Pr(X_{k+n}=S_j | X_k = S_i)$ which can be written as a$\sum_h^\infty Pr(X_{k+n}=S_j | X_{k+n-1}=S_h)Pr(X_{k+n-1}=S_h | X_k= S_i)$. Which can be simplified down even further to the $\sum_1^n P_{jh}P_{hi}^{(n-1)}$. Which can then be simplified to the final version of $P_{ij}(n)$ Class: This is for a class called Seminar. It's a class were supposed to take the year we graduate. It is a class that we do a research essay that we then present to the class and do a set of problems every week with a new topic. (I.E. functions one week, inequalities next, then derivatives, and so on). It's supposed to be a capstone class for our degree that goes over a little bit of everything from the previous three years, but makes you think more and put things together. So we're mathematically mature, but we're not graduate level or anything. If that helps. What I Need: I could use some help fleshing out this proof to a way that would be understandable for any college mathematics students. I'm doing it for a class and need to be able to teach anyone in my class to understand this proof, but statistics isn't my strong suit and any help would be appreciated.","['statistics', 'markov-chains', 'markov-process', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
531137,"For bijection $f:A \rightarrow B$, prove that $f^{-1} \circ f = {\text {id}}_{A}$","I have to prove that for a bijection $f:A \rightarrow B$, $f^{-1} \circ  f = {\text {id}}_{A}$, where ${\text {id}_A}$ is the identity function of $A$, and we define $f^{-1}: B \rightarrow A$ by $f^{-1}(b) = a$ if $f(a)=b$. This definition is given by the homework prompt, so I think it's safe to assume it. Here is my work: For $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, we have defined that if $f(a)=b$, then $f^{-1}(b)=a$, so $f^{-1}(f(a))=a$, so $f^{-1} \circ f:A\rightarrow A$. We know ${\text{id}}_A:A\rightarrow A$ is the bijective function s.t. $\forall a \in A,  {\text{id}}(a)=a$. As the domains of the functions are equal and $\forall a \in A, (f^{-1}\circ f)(a) = {\text {id}}_{A}(a)$, the two functions are equal.

531150,"$C^1[a,b]$ is closed in $C[a,b]$","So, I have the following question: Let $C[a,b]$ denote the space of continuous real-valued functions on
  $[a,b]$ with the sup-metric. Let $C^1[a,b]$ denote the space of
  continuously differentiable functions on $[a,b]$. Is $C^1[a,b]$ a
  closed subset of $C[a,b]$? So, what I've done so far. The sup metric is $d_{\infty}(f,g) = \sup \left\{|f(x) - g(x)| : a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ for $f,g\in C[a,b]$ Clearly $C^1[a,b] \subset C[a,b]$ $C^1[a,b]$ is a closed subset of $C[a,b]$ if $C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ is open in $C[a,b]$ - i.e. $\forall h \in C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that $\left\{ f \in C[a,b] : d_{\infty}(f,h) < \epsilon \right\} \subseteq C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ Which seems to be saying that, essentially, for any non-differentiable continuous function $h$ we can find an $\epsilon > 0$ such that when the supremum of the distance between $h$ and all other continuous functions on $[a,b]$ is less than $\epsilon$, then they will also not be differentiable. This is where I get stuck, not least because I'm not convinced whether that is true or not. Clearly, it's easily possible to create further non-differentiable functions by, for example, moving one point of $h$ less than $\epsilon$. My instinct is that you're not going to be able to turn a non-differentiable function into a differentiable one with an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, so I think such an $\epsilon$ exists - but this obviously isn't formal (or even likely to be correct) Thanks.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

531216,Sampling without replacement until object found,"I'm wondering about sampling without replacement until an object is found. I can't seem to wrap my head around it. The random variable I want to use is X which I let bet the number of objects examined until the object is found. So I'm interested in the probability mass function here. My attempts so far are: (i) Take one sample at a time. Then each sample is a Bernoulli trial with probability at the k-th sample = 1/(n-k+1), 1 <= k <= n So to get P(X=x) I multiply each 1/(n-k+1) from 1 to k inclusive?
i.e. P(X=x) = 1/(n-k+1)! (ii) The problem looks kind of like a hypergeometric distribution with parameters:
number of draws = k, pop. size = n, contains 1 success But the hypergeometric pmf is constructed in terms of obtaining some number of successes from a potential group of successes within the population. For my problem however there is only one success in the potential success group and we want to stop when we get a success. So it's styled more in the way of a geometric distribution. Again, the random variable for a geometric dist. is number of trials needed to get a success. I'm confused anyway, if anyone could shed some light on this I'd be very grateful, thanks","['probability-distributions', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

(Gale-Shapely algorithm) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem Is there are equivalent algorithm for determining the stability of a pairing where women choose men, men choose dogs, and dogs choose women? Are we guaranteed to arrive at a stable matching consisting of a man, a woman, and a dog? I will define stable to mean that if we have two triples
 $(m_1, w_1, d_1$) and ($m_2, w_2, d_2$), then we cannot have that $w_1$ desires to be with $m_2$ more than with $m_1$ and $m_2$ desires to own $d_1$ more than he desires to own $d_2$. We ignore the preference of the dogs in this case. So instability is defined to mean that a member of one triple, call it $T_1$, desires another partnering, and the person or dog with whom they wish to join also desires to leave their own pairing to join with the third member of $T_1$.

I concluded from this that a stationary process is a process which has a stationary joint distribution of random variables , is this correct? If yes, then I guess it also implies stationary distribution of individual random variables(each Xt)? Lastly, it says on wikipedia page of stationary process that ""a stationary process is not the same thing as a ""process with a stationary distribution"""". This is the whole source of my confusion. A stationary process is something whose joint probability distribution doesn't change with time, so is there a difference between a stationary distribution and a distribution which doesn't change with time?

532168,"If $X$ is a compact set, when does $f'(0)$ exist?","Let $X$ be a compact set in $\mathbb R$ and for $t\geq 0$ define $f(t)$ as $$f(t) = m(\{x\in \mathbb R| \exists y \in X : |x-y| \leq t\})$$ Under what conditions for $X$ does $f'(0)$ exist? ($m$ is the Lebesgue measure) If $X$ is finite, then $f'(0)$ exist. Also, if $X$ contains an interval, f'(0) does not exist. I also showed that if $X=\{\frac{1}{2^n}, n\in \mathbb N\} \cup \{0\}$, then $f'(0)$ does not exist. If I am correct, this seems very strange to me, because $X$ has measure $0$ and I would think that for the derivative at zero to exist, the nominator $f(t)-f(0) = f(t)-m(X)$ has to go to $0$ faster than the denominator $t$ and the fastest way for this to happen would be if $X$ had measure $0$, so that $f$ doesn't ""measure"" a lot of points. So, now I am at a loss and can't find what other properties $X$ must have. Thanks for any help and I hope I am clear enough in my explanation! UPDATE : With the help of the comments from Niels Diepeveen, I managed to do some work on this, but I am still stuck on a point. My work: Let $\cal{C}$ be the collection of the connected components of $X$. The claim is that $f'(0)$ exists if and only if $\cal{C}$ is finite. $(\Leftarrow$) If $\cal{C}$ is finite, then $\cal{C}$ $= \{X_1, X_2,..., X_k\}$. Each $X_i$ is closed and they are pairwise disjoint, therefore there is a $t_0$ such that $$\forall x \text{ with }  d(x,X_i) \leq t_0 \Rightarrow d(x, X_j) > t_o, \forall j \neq i$$
Additionaly each $X_i$ is measurable as a closed and bounded set. Hence, for $t \leq t_o$, $f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} m(X_i) + 2kt$ which means that $f'(0) = 2k$. $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $f'(0)$ exists but $\cal{C}$ is infinite. Let $M$ be given. Then there is a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $2k>M$. Then, as before, we find a $t_0$ for $k$ of the sets in $\cal{C}$, let them be $\{X_1,...X_k\}$ such that $$\forall x \text{ with }  d(x,X_i) \leq t_0 \Rightarrow d(x, X_j) > t_o, \forall j \neq i, i,j \in \{0,...,k\}$$
Now the problem is, that if I take $t \leq t_o$ I would like to have $$\frac{f(t)-f(0)}{t-0} \geq \frac{f(t_0) - m(X)}{t_0} \geq \frac{m(X) + 2kt_0 -m(X)}{t_0} = 2k > M$$ and then the problem would be solved. But I don't see how I can prove that first inequality (the others are easy). It actually means that the function $\frac{f(t)}{t}$ is decrasing, which seems logical to me, but I can't prove it.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

The second exercise (3.1 c) asks to show that any conic in $\mathbf{P}^2$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{P}^1$. Both exercises I've been able to solve whenever the characteristic of the field is different from 2. For the first one I used a brute force calculation where I need to divide by two alot (as morphisms are not really allowed at this point). For the second one I used a symmetric matrix to reduce to the case where the defining polynomial is of the form $F(x,y,z)=ax^2+by^2+cz^2$. This approach also assumes a characteristic different from 2 to construct such a matrix. My question now is how to do this in the case where the characteristic of the base field is 2.

532367,Prove convergence using $\varepsilon$-$N$ definition,"This is an example presented by professor in class. I understand the idea behind this kind of definition, but I'm having trouble following my professor's thought process. We must prove that the $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n-1}{n^2} = 0$ using the $\varepsilon$-$N$ definition of a limit of a sequence. So, the foregoing limit is true iff $\forall \varepsilon>0,\  \exists N(\varepsilon)>0 : \forall n \ ( n \geq N \Rightarrow |f(n) - 0| < \varepsilon)$. Now, the way I understand it is that if we prove the conditional statement by choosing an appropriate $N$, we've proven the limit. So first we fix $\varepsilon>0$ since it's given, and play around with $$\displaystyle \left| \frac{2n-1}{n^2} \right| < \varepsilon $$ 
$$|2n-1| < \varepsilon \ n^2 .$$ We note that $|2n-1|<|2n|$ which sits right with me. However, my professor then reasons that $|2n-1|<|2n|<\varepsilon \ n^2$ and so $2n < \varepsilon \ n^2$. How do we know that $2n < \varepsilon \ n^2$? If epsilon is really small, wouldn't there be a point when this inequality is no longer true? This is what is bothering me. From that we conclude that $\displaystyle n>\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and choose $\displaystyle N=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ so that $$n \geq \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \Rightarrow \left| \frac{2n-1}{n^2} \right| < \varepsilon$$ is always true. And that is true iff the limit is true, so the limit is true.

532426,A question of H.G. Wells' mathematics,"H.G Wells' short story The Plattner Story is about a man who somehow ends up being ""inverted"" from left to right. So his heart has moved from left to right, his brain, and any other asymmetries belonging to him. Then H.G Wells' goes on a slight metaphysical exposition: There is no way of taking a man and moving him about in space, as ordinary people understand space, that will result in our changing his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his left his left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side, you could change its sides by simply lifting and turning it over. But with a solid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space as we know it, - taking it out of ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little abstruse, no doubt, but anyone with a slight knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner's right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again to our world. This is leaving me a bit perplexed. A reflection is an odd isometry after all, and rotations/translations are direct. So it shouldn't be possible for the man to be reflected using continuous,direct transformations, regardless of how many dimensions he is using.
