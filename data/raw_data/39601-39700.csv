388903,studying the topology of a real algebraic set,"Let $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_m]$ be polynomials with real coefficients and let $I$ be the ideal that they generate.

Main question: What are the tools that i can use in order to study the topology of $V_{\mathbb{R}}(I)$ induced by e.g. the Euclidean topology of $\mathbb{R}^m$? More specifically, i need to perform computations in order to determine the number of connected components and possibly find equations that describe them.

388913,Combinatorics: Distributions with several constraints - potential generating sequences?,"This seems to be a ""stars and bars problem"" - however I am unsure how to apply a constraint.  Furthermore, I would like to understand how this would be done in both counting as well as generating functions. The question:  There are 5 brother sister pairs.  I have 10 identical barbie dolls and 10 identical toy cars. How many ways can you distribute the barbie dolls among girls and toy cars among boys such that every one gets a gift and every brother-sister pair has at least 3 gifts? Here is what I have with counting:  Since every boy has to get a toy as well as every girl, there are then 5 toy cars and 5 barbie dolls left for distribution.  This then leads to $$ (5+5-1)C(5-1))^{2} $$ as there are 5 toys and 5 boys (considering them as ""bins"") as well as the same with girls hence multiplying these two combinations together will give the total number of combinations between the two. The next part though gives me more troubles as I am unsure of how to put the constraint on - that each brother-sister pair has to have 3 gifts.  Now we know that each pair has at least 2 gifts as they all received one.  So if each pair received 3 gifts, there would be a total of 15 gifts that have set distributions.  Now we don't care if the brother-sister pair get an extra girl toy or a boy toy, so we have 5 total toys that can be distributed.  Would we then have 5 pairs (bins) and 5 toys such that again we would have $$ (5+5-1)C(5-1)) $$  ways to distribute the 5 remaining toys - hence give us a grand total of $$ (5+5-1)C(5-1))^{3} $$ ways to do this? How would I go about doing this with generating functions?  I am guessing I would start with that since each child gets a toy, that as above I would have 5 cars and 5 dolls to distribute among the boys and girls respectively.  So I would have, along with each pair getting 3 toys (x^3?) thus: $$(x^{1}+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}+x^{5})(x^{1}+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}+x^{5})$$ I however don't see how to add the constraint for the brother-sister pair getting at least 3 toys, as well as which coefficient in the generating function to look for.  I do however see that the above can be reduced to: $$x^{2}(x^{0}+x^{1}+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4})(x^{0}+x^{1}+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}) = x^{2}(1-x^{5}/(1-x))^{2}$$ Not sure what to do from here.

388919,An example of a commutative ring in which every primary ideal is prime,"It is clear that every prime ideal in a commutative ring is primary. The converse is false; for example, in the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ the ideal $(p^2)$ is an example of a primary ideal that is not prime (where $p$ is a prime number). So my question is when does the converse hold: 1) Is there any characterization of commutative rings in which every
  primary ideal is prime? One class of rings satisfying the above condition are absolutely flat rings. In fact, it is known that in every absolutely flat ring every primary ideal is maximal (see, for example, exercise 3 in page 55 of ""Introduction to Commutative Algebra"" by Atiyah & Macdonald). Here is my second question, that is more specific: 2) What would be an example of an ring in which every primary ideal is
  prime, but not every primary ideal is maximal? An answer for question 1) would probably solve 2) easily. Thanks!","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Two I'm no maths expert, nevertheless I was able to work out a solution for whole numbers : When I pick the highest of two random whole numbers from $x$ to $y$ ... Let $n$ be the count of possible results $n = y - x + 1$. I looked at the probability of every single possible outcome and noticed an arithmetic sequence. I knew the sequence had to start with the rarest possibility: Rolling two times in a row the lowest value. $$p_1 = \frac{1}{n^2}$$ And I knew the sequence had to have a sum of 100 %. This made it possible to calculate the last, the $n$th, element: $$p_n = \frac{2}{n} - p_1$$ Based on that it was easy to calculate the difference between elements and subsequently the formula for the sequence. $$p_i = \frac{2in-2i-n+1}{n^3-n^2}$$ All I had to do now, was multiplying the probabilities with their respective values and sum this. $$

388974,Showing ${\frak c}:=|\Bbb{R}|=2^{\aleph_0}$ using only the axioms of the reals,"It is a well-known fact that the cardinality of the continuum, ${\frak c}:=|\Bbb{R}|$, is the same as the cardinality of the powerset of the natural numbers, but I've tasked myself with proving the result from scratch, and naturally a whole bevy of little issues come up that I hadn't thought of to begin with. The kicker here is that I want to prove this using only the axioms of the real numbers, not any construction-dependent facts. It is sufficient by Schroeder-Bernstein to prove ${\frak c}\le2^{\aleph_0}$ and ${\frak c}\ge2^{\aleph_0}$, and one direction is clear: the function $f(A)=\sum_{i\in A}3^{-i}$ for $A\subseteq\Bbb{N}$ is an injective map from ${\cal P}(\Bbb{N})\approx2^{\aleph_0}$ to the Cantor set, which is a subset of the reals (note that by using $3^{-i}$ instead of $2^{-i}$, I avoid that silly technicality about non-unique decimal expansions), so ${\frak c}\ge2^{\aleph_0}$. To prove the converse, I don't know whether it can be done using only the axioms (stated here ). Given a construction of the reals by Dedekind cuts, we note that each real number is a set of rationals, so $\Bbb{R}\subseteq{\cal P}(\Bbb{Q})\Rightarrow{\frak c}\le2^\Bbb{Q}=2^{\aleph_0}$. Alternatively, if we use Cauchy sequences, we know that each real number is a an equivalence class of sequences of rational numbers, so ${\frak c}\le_*\Bbb{Q^N}=2^{\aleph_0}$ (where the $\le_*$ indicates the existence of a surjection), and after an application of AC, we get ${\frak c}\le2^{\aleph_0}$. But if I had no construction, can it even be done? I've heard some stuff about $\Bbb{R}$ being ""the unique order-complete field up to isomorphism"" or something like that, so it should be possible to use a pure axiomatic approach to get the result, but the principal counterexample in my mind is the surreal numbers $\sf{No}$, which (I believe) also satisfy all the listed axioms (except the existence one, since $\sf{No}\supseteq\sf{On}$), and obviously there are a lot more surreal numbers than real numbers. Are there missing axioms that I need to prove this?","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

389036,Dominant morphism between affine varieties induces injection on coordinate rings?,"Here are the definitions that we use for this problem: A morphism $\varphi : X \to Y$ between two varieties is said to be dominant if the image of $\varphi$ is dense in $Y$ (c.f. Hartshorne exercise 1.3.17) We say $X$ is an affine variety if it is an irreducible closed subset of $\Bbb{A}^n$. (see the definition after example 1.1.4 of Hartshorne) Now let $X$ and $Y$ be affine varieties and $\varphi : X \to Y$ a dominant morphism. Now this means that for all $p \in X$, $\varphi^\ast_p : \mathcal{O}_{\varphi(p),Y} \to \mathcal{O}_{p,X}$ is injective (c.f. Hartshorne exercise 1.3.3 (c)). Because we have assumed that $X,Y$ are affine varieties we identify $\mathcal{O}_{p,X} \cong A(X)_{\mathfrak{m}_p}$ and similarly for $Y$ to get that $$(\varphi^\ast)_p : A(Y)_{\mathfrak{m}_{\varphi(p)}} \to A(X)_{\mathfrak{m}_p}$$ is injective for all $p\in X$. My question is: Is it true that $\varphi^\ast : A(Y) \to A(X)$ is injective? Here are some partial results I can get. Choose a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_q \subseteq A(Y)$. If $\ker \varphi^\ast$ is completely contained in $\mathfrak{m}_q$ then $$(\mathfrak{m}_q)_{\mathfrak{m}_q} (\ker \varphi^\ast)_{\mathfrak{m}_q} = (\ker \varphi^\ast)_{\mathfrak{m}_q}.$$ The ring $A(Y)_{\mathfrak{m}_q}$ is local and Noetherian so $(\ker \varphi^\ast)_{\mathfrak{m}_q}$ is finitely generated as a module over this ring.

389065,"Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$, with $p$ and $q$ prime. Prove that the order of the center of $G$ is 1 or $pq$.","Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$, with $p$ and $q$ prime. Prove that
  the order of the center of $G$ is 1 or $pq$. Let me start off with what I did: Assume $G$ is abelian. Then we know $Z(G)=G$, thus the center must have order $pq$. Now assume $G$ is non-abelian. By Cauchy's theorem we know there must exist elements $x$ and $y$ of respectively order $p$ and $q$. Without loss of generality we can assume $p \leq q$. Because $[G: \langle y \rangle ] = p$, and $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $G$, $\langle y \rangle$ must be a normal subgroup of $G$. I claim that $\langle x \rangle$ is a complete set of representatives for $\langle y \rangle$ in $G$. We know, because $p$ is prime, that $\langle x \rangle$ is cyclic and therefore, $\langle x \rangle = \{ x^k : k \in \{ 0, \dots , p-1 \} \}$. We can assume $i < j$. If $x^i \langle y \rangle = x^j \langle y \rangle$, then $x^{-i}x^j = x^{j-i} \in \langle y \rangle$. But $x^{j-i} \in \langle x \rangle$, thus of order p, hence $x^{j-i}$ can't be in $\langle y \rangle$. As so, $\langle x \rangle$ gives a full set of representatives. Now we can write every element in $G$ as $x^m y^n$, with $m \in \{ 0 , \dots , p-1\}$ and $n \in \{ 0, \dots , q-1\}$. Furthermore, every element other than the identity element has either order $p$ or $q$, or else $G$ would be cyclic, and thus abelian. Now I'm kind of stuck, but I want to prove that there exists an element in $G$ which doesn't commute with anything in $G$, except for the identity element. I know there is an easier solution to this, namely by saying that the order of $Z(G)$ must divide the order of the group $G$. So either it must be $1, p, q$ or $pq$. However it can't be $pq$, or else the group would be cyclic and thus abelian. Nor can it be $p$, since then $[G : Z(G) ] = q$, and thus it's cyclic, so by a specific theorem $G$ must be abelian. The same argument for $q$. I think the proof of that specific theorem has to do with the proof I started. However I can't connect the dots. But I do want to know how I should finish it this way (if that is possible). Thanks in advance for any help.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
389066,"""Deformation"" of the kernel of a linear map","It is known that the roots of a monic polynomial of fixed degree vary continuously (smoothly?) with its coefficients, at least over $\mathbb{C}$.  My question is whether there is such a result for linear maps.  To be precise: Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ be an open set and $A: U \to M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{R}^{mn}$ a smooth map.  Suppose that for all $t \in U$, $\ker(A(t))$ is $l$-dimensional.  Fix $t_0 \in U$.  Is there an open set $\tilde{U} \subseteq U$ containing $t_0$ and smooth function $f: \tilde{U} \times \mathbb{R}^l \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(t,\mathbb{R}^l) = \ker(A(t))$ for all $t \in \tilde{U}$? I think this is true.  Here is an example.  Let $A(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos t & -\sin t \end{pmatrix}$. Then for $t \in (-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$, we have $\ker A(t) = \langle (\tan t, 1) \rangle$, so we can take $f(t,\lambda) = \lambda (\tan t, 1)$.  Intuitively, it seems that if the rank of a linear map is fixed, nothing else too catastrophic can happen to its level sets - similar to how nothing strange happens with the roots of a polynomial except for their number as the coefficients are varied.

389068,"Can we use proper classes in this way, to define a new infinity larger than |Ord|?","I believe there is a way to do this that makes sense, and I explain it below. I would like to know if I did some obvious  mistake, or if the idea doesn't make sense for some reason I didn't figure it out. We can generalize the idea of an ordinal number in the same way we did it to expand $\mathbb{N}$ to $\omega$ and beyond. 
Basically, you get the ordinals when you define a limit to the infinite sequence $1,2,...n,...$ which in its most naive definition has no limit, and call it $\omega$. Now we put one $\omega$ after another, in the same way that we had put one natural number after another, and we get not only countable infinite sets of various cofinalities, but we also reach uncountable sets. And not only of cardinality $2^{\omega}$, but also of any large cardinality (if we use the standard definition of cardinal). 
But we still reach a ""limit"". The limit is |V| (or |Ord|), the proper class of all ordinals. So, somehow, the infinities within ZFC (or most other popular variants of set theory) reach a limit, in the same sense that the naturals reach $\omega$. So what happens if we put two proper classes one after another? (actually, we should start with a proper class and a set, one after another, and get $|V|+1, |V|+2, ... , |V|+|V|=|V|. 2, ...$ etc). We can try to name these infinities in the same way as we did with the transfinite ordinals (either countable or uncountable ones). Doing this gets infinities well beyond |V| (and presumably without any paradox). They are not sets, or course, they are other kind of object that generalizes what a set is. In the same way that an infinite ordinal  generalizes what  a natural number is (they are perhaps not proper classes either, but just put them a new name). 
Could we say that |V| is a fixed point of the power set operator? (you cannot reach |V|+1 from |V| within ZFC, I guess, or you can, but you would need to use some non-standard model, by analogy with the non-standard models of PA). 
Even if we do so, we will end up reaching some new limit, or fixed point. And when we reach it,  we can start all over again. So we can have a hierarchy of theories that can reach higher and higher infinities. Each theory has a fixed point, in the sense that the point is the ""infinity class"" that the standard model of the theory can reach. Let us call them $S^n$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, roughly:  $S^0=PA$ (can reach $\omega$), $S^1=ZFC$ (can reach |Ord|), $S^2=?$ (reaches beyond the standard ordinals), ...., . But we can keep doing this forever, and define a new theory that is the limit of all previous theories. And so on, ad nauseam... Do this makes sense at all???","['logic', 'foundations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'soft-question']"

389128,"Why Zorn's Lemma ""fails"" on nested boxes problem?","Backgound My problem comes from the nested boxes problem. Consider a list of boxes. Each box has a length, width, and height. Since the boxes can be rotated those terms are interchangeable. The boxes have rectangular surfaces and can be nested inside each other. A box can nest inside another box if all its dimensions are less than the corresponding dimensions of the other. You may only nest a box such that the corresponding surfaces are parallel to each other. A box may not be nested along the diagonal. You cannot also put two or more boxes side by side inside another box. Therefore, a box can be represented by a sorted (it's not hard to show that sorting the dimensions in ascending order won't affect the result of whether a box can be nested inside another) tuple of dimensions.  The set of boxes and the relation of being able to nested in another actually form a partially ordered set. And here comes my problem: Formalization Let's use an example. Let $S=\{(1,1,1),\,(3,4,4),\,(2,5,5)\}$. We define relation $\le$ to be
$$
(x_1,y_1,z_1)\le(x_2,y_2,z_2) \text{ if and only if } x_1\le x_2,\,y_1\le y_2,\,\text{and }z_1\le z_2
$$
We see that $(S,\le)$ is a partially ordered set. Now, all the totally ordered subset of $S$ are:
$$
S_1=\{(1,1,1),\,(3,4,4)\}\quad S_2=\{(1,1,1),(2,5,5)\}
$$
where $(3,4,4)$ is the upper bound of $S_1$, $(2,5,5)$ is the upper bound of $S_2$. However, Zorn's Lemma says: Suppose a partially ordered set $P$ has the property that every chain (i.e. totally ordered subset) has an upper bound in $P$. Then the set $P$ contains at least one maximal element. Therefore, $S$ must have a maximal element. But it's obvious that $S$ doesn't have one. Did I miss something here?

It was not hard to find the relation between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, namely $f(x)=g(x)-4g(x^2)+4g(x^4)$. Note that $g(x)$ is a Lambert series , so by expanding the Taylor series for the denominators and reversing the two sums, I get $$g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sigma(n)x^n$$ where $\sigma$ is the divisor function $\sigma(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d$. I then define for complex $\tau$ the function 
$$G_2(\tau)=\frac{\pi^2}3\Bigl(1-24\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sigma(n)e^{2\pi in\tau}\Bigr)$$ so that
$$f(e^{-\pi})=g(e^{-\pi})-4g(e^{-2\pi})+4g(e^{-4\pi})=\frac1{24}+\frac{-G_2(\frac i2)+4G_2(i)-4G_2(2i)}{8\pi^2}.$$ But it is proven in Apostol ""Modular forms and Dirichlet Series"", page 69-71 that $G_2\bigl(-\frac1{\tau}\bigr)=\tau^2G_2(\tau)-2\pi i\tau$, which gives $\begin{cases}G_2(i)=-G_2(i)+2\pi\\ G_2(\frac i2)=-4G_2(2i)+4\pi\end{cases}\quad$.

389489,"(Non) Complete, (Non) separable, (Non) metrizable spaces","After studying several kinds of topological spaces (Like $L_p, C[0,1]$) etc., I thought it would be useful to me (and to others) if I tabulated some of them under 3 categories: Completeness(C), Separability(S) and Metrizability(M). Now this yields a total of 8 possibilities from spaces that are neither to spaces that are all 3. So far I have the following: C,S,M : $\mathbb{R}^n$, $C[0,1]$, $L_p(\mu), 1\leq p < \infty$ where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure. C,~S,M : $L_{\infty}(\mu)$ ~C,S,M : $D[0,1]$ space under the Skorokhod's metric. However, under Billingsley's Metric (ref. Richard Bass ""Stochastic Processes""), it is C,S,M. ~C,S,~M  : The Lower Limit topology of $\mathbb{R}$. Since completeness is a property of a metric space, you can never have (C,~M). That eliminates two cases. So that leaves me with (~C,~S,M) and (~C,~S,~M) for which I have no examples as of yet. I require at least 1 example in each to complete my list. Question: Kindly help me find the remaining examples. References are welcome. My searches: I searched for non complete non separable non metrizable spaces, but that didn't add to the table.

Author's Solution: Assume $S$ is centered at the origin with radius $a$ . Let $U$ and $L$ be the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively, of $S.$ Then by Stokes' Theorem: $\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iint_U (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{U} + \iint_L (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{L} = \oint_{\partial U} \! \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r} + \oint_{\partial L} \! \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}  $ But ${\partial U}$ is $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$ oriented counterclockwise  and $\color{red}{{\partial L} \text{ is the same circle oriented clockwise}}$ . (Rest of solution omitted) Criterion A for Orientation of Boundary Curve (from Stewart p. 1093): If you walk in the positive direction around $\partial S$ and your head points in the direction of $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ , then the surface will always be on your left. Criterion B (from Thomas' Calculus , 2009 12 edn, p 963): If the thumb of a right hand points along $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ , then the fingers curl in the direction of $\partial S$ . I know that the orientation of $S$ determines the positive orientation of $\partial S$ . Also, the outward unit normals determine any closed surface's positive orientation . Here, the outward unit normals have $z$ -component $< 0$ which yields the person in red. $\color{purple}{\text{By Criterion A, the red person's head is pointing downwards (in the $-z$ direction)}}.$ $\color{purple}{\text{The purple direction is compulsory for the surface to be on that person's left.}}$ By Criterion B, my thumb must point in the $-z$ direction. So my fingers curl in the orange direction. Why's there a discrepancy between Criteria A and B? Where's the mistake? $\Large{\text{Supplementary to Prof Shifrin's Answer:}}$ Here's my interpretation: The red person must travel in the purple direction, for the surface to be on her left.

I had to draw a clock in my updated picture to spot this.

Is there a more intuitive or natural explanation, without drawing clocks? $\Large{\text{2nd Supplementary to Prof Shifrin's Answer:}}$ I still don't understand how to spot that reflections across the $xy$ -plane reserve orientation (but preserve direction), without looking at a sheet of paper from above and below. $\Large{1.}$ Why did you choose the basis { $j, -i, k$ }, instead of the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ ? $\Large{2.}$ Doesn't $-i := (-1,0,0)$ imply that the tip of the vector, lying on the $x$ -axis, point towards $-\infty.$ How does it ""still point inward""?",['multivariable-calculus']
389532,Is my proof correct?

Prove that there exist $x \in X,y \in Y$ such that $d(x,y)$ is a minimum."" My attempt: Define $E:=\{d(x,y): x \in X,y \in Y \}$. We will prove that $E \subset \mathbb R$ is compact. Firstly we will prove that $E$ is bounded: $X$ is compact, and therefore it is bounded. That is, there exist $x_0 \in X,r_1>0$ such that $d(x,x_0)<r_1$ for all $x \in X$. $Y$ is also compact, and similarly there exist $y_0 \in Y,r_2>0$ such that $d(y,y_0)<r_2$ for all $y \in Y$. Now, for any $d(x,y) \in E$, we have $$d(x,y) \leq d(x,x_0)+d(x_0,y_0)+d(y,y_0)<r_1+d(x_0,y_0)+r_2 =:M.$$ This proves that $E$ is bounded. And now we will prove that $E$ is also closed: Let $a_n=d(x_n,y_n)$ be sequence in $E$, which is convergent in $\mathbb R$. We will prove that its limit $a:=\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ is in $E$. $(x_n)$ is a sequence in the compact set $X$, therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k}) \to \bar{x}$. $(y_{n_k})$ is a sequence in the compact set $Y$, and therefore it admits a convergent subsequence $(y_{n_{k_l}}) \to \bar{y}$. The sequence $(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})_l$ converges to $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ in the product space, and the continuity of the metric gives $a=\lim_{l \to \infty} a_{n_{k_l}}=\lim_{l \to \infty} d(x_{n_{k_l}},y_{n_{k_l}})=d(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. This shows that $a \in E$ as required. In summary I have shown that $E$ is compact, and from a well-known theorem it has a minimum. Is this proof OK? I think that the completeness of $S$ is unnecessary. Thank you.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"

I'm trying to use the above result to extend it to the higher power.

We can 'lift' the root iteratively up to higher powers. I'm unsure exactly how this process works.

How to prove that there exists some $z_0 \in U_{1} [0] $ such that $$ \prod_{k=1}^{n} |z_0 - a_k| \geq 1 ? $$
Here's what I tried thus far: First, pick a $z_0$ such that $|z_0 - a_j| \geq 1 $ for some $1 \leq j \leq n$. Then pick another point $a_k$ on the unit cirle. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a_j - a_k| + |z_0 - a_k | \geq |z_0 - a_j| \geq 1 $, so $|z_0 - a_k | \geq 1 - |a_j - a_k| $. Therefore, we find that $$ \prod_{k=1}^{n} |z_0 - a_k | \geq |z_0 - a_j| \cdot \prod_{k=1 , k \neq j }^{n} (1 - |a_j - a_k| ) \geq  \prod_{k=1 , k \neq j }^{n} (1 - |a_j - a_k| ) .$$ I don't know how to proceed from here though.

389793,What is the most elementary proof that $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1+1/n)^n$ exists?,"Here is my candidate for 
the most elementary proof that $\lim_{n \to \infty}(1+1/n)^n $ exists.
I would be interested in seeing others. $***$ Added after some comments:
I prove here by very elementary means that the limit exists.
Calling the limit ""$e$"" names it.
$***$ It only needs Bernoulli's inequality (BI)
in the form
$(1+x)^n \ge 1+nx$
for $x > -1$ and
$n$ a positive integer,
with equality only if
$x = 0$ or $n = 1$.
This is easily proved by induction:
It is true for $n=1$,
and $(1+x)^{n+1}
= (1+x)(1+x)^n
\ge (1+x)(1+nx)
= 1+(n+1)x+nx^2
\ge 1+(n+1)x
$.
(If $-1 < x < 0$,
if $1+nx \ge 0$,
the above proof goes through, and if
$1+nx < 0$,
$1+mx < 0$ for all $m \ge n$
so certainly $(1+x)^m > 1+mx$.) This proof originally appeared in
N.S Mendelsohn, An application of a famous inequality, Amer. Math. Monthly 58 (1951), 563
and uses the
arithmetic-geometric mean inequality (AGMI)
in the form
$\big(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i/n\big)^n \ge \prod_{i=1}^n v_i$
 (all $v_i$ positive) with equality if and only if all the $v_i$ are equal. Let $a_n = (1+1/n)^n$ and $b_n = (1+1/n)^{n+1}$. 
We will prove that $a_n$ is an increasing sequence
 and $b_n$ is an decreasing sequence. 
Since $a_n < b_n$, this implies, 
for any positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m < n$
 that $a_m < a_n < b_n < b_m$. For $a_n$, consider n values of $1+1/n$ and $1$ value of $1$. 
Since their sum is $n+2$
and their product is $(1+1/n)^n$,
by the AGMI, 
$((n+2)/(n+1))^{n+1} > (1+1/n)^n$,
 or $(1+1/(n+1))^{n+1} > (1+1/n)^n$, 
or $a_{n+1} > a_n$. 
For $b_n$, consider $n$ values of $1-1/n$ and $1$ value of $1$. 
Since their sum is $n$
and their product is $(1-1/n)^n$,
by the AGMI, 
$(n/(n+1))^{n+1} > (1-1/n)^n$
 or $(1+1/n)^{n+1} < (1+1/(n-1))^n$,
 or $b_n > b_{n+1}$. Since $b_n-a_n 
= (1+1/n)^{n+1} - (1+1/n)^n
= (1+1/n)^n(1/n)
=a_n/n
$
and every $a_n$ is less than any $b_n$
and $b_3 = (1+1/3)^4 = 256/81 < 4$,
$b_n-a_n < 4/n$,
so $b_n$ and $a_n$ converge to a common limit. These proofs do not seem to be really elementary,
 since they use the AGMI. 
However, they use a special form of the AGMI, 
where all but one of the values are the same, 
and this will now be shown to be implied by BI,
 and thus be truly elementary. Suppose we have $n-1$ values of $u$ and $1$ value of $v$ with $u$ and $v$ positive. 
The AGMI for these values is 
$(((n-1)u+v)/n)^n \ge u^{n-1}v$ 
with equality if and only if $u = v$. 
We will now show that this is implied by BI:
$(((n-1)u+v)/n)^n \ge u^{n-1}v$
 is the same as 
$(u+(v-u)/n)^n \ge u^n(v/u)$. 
Dividing by $u^n$, 
this is equivalent to 
$(1+(v/u-1)/n)^n \ge v/u$. 
By BI, 
since $(v/u-1)/n > -1/n > -1$,
$(1+(v/u-1)/n)^n \ge 1+n((v/u-1)/n) = v/u$ 
with equality only if $n=1$ or $v/u-1 = 0$.
Thus BI implies this version of the AGMI.","['real-analysis', 'limits']"
