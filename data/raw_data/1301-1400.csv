8892,"Number of undirected trees with labeled edges, one repeating","I need to find the number of undirected trees on $n$ vertices such that the edges (and not the vertices) are labeled and exactly one label appears twice (i.e. there are $n-2$ possible labels and they all appear). My reasoning goes like this: From Cayley's formula we know there are $n^{n-2}$ trees with labeled vertices. Erase the label $n$ from its vertex and for every other vertex, move the label from the vertex itself to the edge in the direction of the $n$ vertex. This way we get a tree with $n-1$ labels for the edges. However, this argument is flawed, since for example 0--1--2 and 0--2--1 give the same labeled tree. Now assume that I managed to fix the problem and find the number of edge-labeled trees with $n-1$ edges, and let's denote it by $k$; my next idea is choosing one of the $n-2$ first labels and relabeling $n-1$ to what I choose. This causes double-counting so I think I need to divide by 2 here, but nothing more. Hence the final number is $(n-2)k/2$. Am I correct in this reasoning - and how can I find k? Quite obviously it's not $n^{n-2}$ since otherwise $(n-2)k/2$ might not even be an integer (if $n$ is odd).","['graph-theory', 'trees', 'combinatorics']"

8921,A conjecture of parallelogram inside convex and central symmetric curve,"Assume Q is a convex central symmetric curve, whose area is $\displaystyle S$.
The area of the maximum parallelogram inside Q is $\displaystyle S'$. How to prove the conjecture that $\displaystyle \frac{S'}{S} \ge \frac{2}{\pi}=0.6366\dots$? For example, If Q is an ellipse, $\displaystyle S'=2ab$, $\displaystyle S=\pi ab$. 
If Q is a regular hexagon, $\displaystyle \frac{S'}{S}= \frac{2}{3}$. It's trivial that $\displaystyle \frac{S'}{S} \ge \frac{1}{2}$, and I know how to prove $\displaystyle \frac{S'}{S} \ge \frac{4}{4+\pi}=0.56\dots$ From many reason, I believe this conjecture is true.
  Denote MAP=""Maximum Area Parallelogram"":
  For any $Q$ and any direction $\theta$, let $P(Q,\theta)$ be the area of MAP which have a corner in this direction.     $S'=\max\{P(Q,\theta)\}$.      In order to make $\frac{S'}{S}$ smallest, We need keep the largest one of $\{P(Q,\theta)\}$ small while S is a constant. Ellipse just keeps everyone in  $\{P(Q,\theta)\}$ average. This is very special, I don't think there will be other curve having this property. On the other hand, distribute equally always lead to the min-max in our knowledge. About the $\frac{4}{4+\pi}$ lowerbound, the idea is as follows:
First, use polar function $r(\theta)$ to describe the curve. The condition is that $r(a)r(b)\sin|a-b|\leq C$, and we want to bound is $S=\int_{\theta}{r(\theta)}^2$. 
Second, Without lose of generality, We assume $r(0)=r(90)=1,C=1$, and assume $Q$ is in the boundary of $Z=\{(x,y)|-1\leq x,y\leq 1\}$. Third, let $a=r(\theta)$ and $b=r(\theta+90)$ and find a bound for $(a^2+b^2)$ by Cauchy-Inequality. and it will give a bound for the area $S$.","['geometry', 'conjectures', 'convex-optimization']"

8927,"what size is a ""unit torus""?","Wikipedia articles on ""unit sphere"" and ""unit circle"" say the radius is 1. Articles on the ""unit square"" and ""unit cube"" say the length of the side is 1. Would you expect a unit torus to have major radius 1 or major diameter 1? Admittedly, a torus is a different animal than a sphere, but... It feels most natural to me that the ""unit"" length should apply to the (major) radius, not the major diameter. Yet I recently came across open source code where someone generated a ""unit torus"" of major diameter 1. Is that ""wrong enough"" that I should change it (in a package of related changes that I'm already preparing to submit)? Can you give me a more solid mathematical basis for advocating that change? Or should I accept the status quo as just a different but legitimate interpretation of ""unit torus""? Edit: I see from search hits like the following Spectral Analysis of Virus Spreading in Random Geometric Graphs Unconditional Proof of the Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Hypothesis The cover time of random geometric graphs Dimers and amoebae that the term ""unit torus"" is used in some fields, like dynamical systems and discrete algorithms. But I'm unable to tell from these papers or abstracts what the authors mean exactly by ""unit torus"". Dimers and amoebae actually gives this definition: the unit torus T 2 = {(z,w) ∈ C 2 : |z|
  = |w| = 1} This definition appears to give a definite size. But if it's in the two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers, I don't know how to apply it to $\mathbb{R}^3$. If ""unit torus"" (in $\mathbb{R}^3$) actually means something that does not have any particular size , then that would be important to know. My question is really not one of programming, but of what this term means in mathematics... including, to what degree is it actually defined (or not) in math?

8937,Why is the Artin-Rees lemma used here?,"I am currently engaged in independent study of algebraic geometry, using Dan Bump's book.

Then $M = 0$. The hints direct me to use the Artin-Rees lemma to show that $\mathfrak{m} M = M$, then use Nakayama's lemma to show that $M = 0$ (this second step is easy). I showed this to a professor and he accused the book of using big machinery for no reason, arguing that $$\mathfrak{m} M = \mathfrak{m} \bigcap_{n \ge 0} \mathfrak{m}^n = \bigcap_{n \ge 1} \mathfrak{m}^n = M.$$ Does this argument work?

Therefore the other tests I am left with are alternating series test , intergral test , comparison test and limit comparison test (that we know about). Seems like it would be a messy integral and that would not work or I would not be able to solve it. I think I could show this using the alternating series test IF the limit of the series is 0.  My problem is formally showing that the limit of this series is 0.  I can't quite get past that. My only option left if the alternating series test does not work is the limit comparison test, since the series is not > 0 for large n, and therefore we cannot use the comparison test.

Two other random variables $U$ and $V$ are defined by $U = \frac{1}{2}(X+Y)$ and $V = \frac{1}{2}(X-Y)$. Calculate $\text{Cov}(U,V)$. So $\text{Cov}(U,V) = E(UV)-E(U)E(V)$.

8961,To what extent can you manipulate differentials like dy and dt like actual values?,"I have been thinking about the differentials that we use in derivatives and integrals. For example, I have an equation: $${\int{w}{dr}} = \text{other stuff}$$ The context for this strange equation was:

r'(t) &= c - d r(t) - e q(t)\\
r''(t)&= d r'(t) - e q'(t)\\
r''(t)&= d r' - e a + \frac{eb}{r}\\
w&=r'\\
w' &= d w - ea + \frac{eb}{r}\\
\frac{dw}{dr} \frac{dr}{dt}&= d w - ea + \frac{eb}{r}\\
w \frac{dw}{dr} &= dw - ea + \frac{eb}{r}

$$\frac{w^2}{2} = \int{d*w dr} - ea r + eb log(r)$$
Shift the integral to the left hand side:
$$\int d * w dr = - \frac{w^2}{2} - ea * r - eb * log(r)$$ Divide by $d$:
$$\int w dr = \frac{w^2}{2d} - \frac{ear}{d}-\frac{eb}{d} log(r)$$
And I get to that $w\, dr$. So if I can replace $w$ with ${\frac{dr}{dt}}$, and differentials can be multiplied like normal, I would get ${\frac{dr^2}{dt}}$. Then I have the idea of multiplying by ${\frac{dt}{dt}}$. Can I go ahead and do this? That would give me

I've decided to ask here because it is bugging me and I don't have any friends also studying this subject (in case it is of any use, I'm an undergraduate). Let $R$ be a commutative noetherian ring. If $A$, $B$ are finitely generated $R$-modules, then $\operatorname{Hom}_R(A,B)$ is a finitely generated $R$-module. Here's what I've thought as of yet (maybe the problem is that I haven't been trying to apply the useful theorems...): First of all, since $R$ is noetherian, it suffices to inject $\operatorname{Hom}_R(A,B)$ into some finitely generated module (in noetherian rings, submodules of f.g. are f.g.). Now, since $R$ is commutative (or since $R$ is noetherian), a finitely generated $R$-module is a quotient of $R^n$ for some $n$. Then let us write $A\simeq \frac{R^n}{I}$ and $B\simeq \frac{R^m}{J}$. Now we've got: $\operatorname{Hom}_R(A,B)\simeq \operatorname{Hom}_R\left(\frac{R^n}{I},\frac{R^m}{J}\right)$. If I had $\operatorname{Hom}_R\left(\frac{R^n}{I},\frac{R^m}{J}\right) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_R(R^n, R^m)$ (this is what I tend to think is the wrong direction, but a interesting question-rising path nevertheless) then it would be over since $\operatorname{Hom}_R(R^n, R^m)\simeq R^{nm}$ which is finitely generated. So I ask myself: can I see $\frac{R^n}{I}$ as a submodule of $R^n$? Because if I could, then doing the same thing for $R^m$ and passing it to the hom, then it would be over. Now, this would be true if the sequence $$0\to I\hookrightarrow R^n\to \frac{R^n}{I} \to 0$$ split. But this (of course) doesn't always happen. But if I somehow had the third module to be projective, or the first one to be injective, then it would happen. But why would, for example, be $\frac{R^n}{I}$ be projective? And this is where I got stuck. I'm sorry if this is overly detailed, but I remember reading that it is always good, when asking about a textbook question, to add what you've thought up to that moment.

You get 
$$\frac{b-a}{\int_a^b \frac{dx}{f(x)}} .$$ Thus, if you take $f(x) = x$ you obtain the harmonic mean of the continuous interval $[a,b]$.  This is 
$$H([a,b]) = \frac{b-a}{\int_a^b \frac{1}{x}  dx} = \frac{b-a}{\ln b - \ln a} = L(a,b).$$ My question is this: Is there an intuitive reason why $H([a,b]) = L(a,b)$?

I always find that when the audience is not up for a long technical proof, and they aren't familiar with the field (in this case combinatorial geometry) that it is important to provide strong motivation for why the problem is important, and perhaps mention a couple interesting related results that have applications in other fields, or to other problems. For the Happy Ending problem, I am aware of connections to the $n$-hole problem for points in general position, Ramsey theory (via the original paper by erdos and szekeres in 1935), and the generalization of the E&S theorem for convex bodies.  But Im not sure if these are good things to mention since the class does not know any Ramsey theory and convex bodies are probably too abstract to mention offhand. So my question is: does anyone know of other interesting related results to the Happy Ending Problem, and the corresponding theorem and conjecture. Or, can you tell me succinctly why or why not this conjecture is important in mathematics. I will accept anything along the lines of similar geometrically or combinatorially, directly related, or mentioned in a paper involving the E&S conjecture. The original paper from 1935 is a goldmine of things like the ordered pigeonhole principle, but Im interested in things I havent read yet.","['geometry', 'discrete-geometry', 'combinatorics']"
9057,How to do hypothesis testing on Gaussian mixture model?,"I am CS major, please be patient if my question is not well-stated. The dataset is quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data.

Most proteins remain unchanged between A and B. The population of log-ratios distributes around 1. The histogram shows a bell shape with fat tails. Two-term Gaussian mixture model has been found to provide a good fit to experimental noise. I suppose it would work good for this data - think of experimental and biological noise.

One construction we can do, for example, is create the ""tangent scheme"", which is obtained by localizing and completing.  The examples I've been looking at are $\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a$, $\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m$, $(\mathbb{Z}[[t]],F)$ (FGLs (1-dimensional, commutative) more generally), $T_1C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a,\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m)\cong C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a,\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a)$ (""commutative $k$-variate FGLs satisfying the 2-cocycle condition""), etc.  We then have exponential maps, which e.g. in the last case is $exp:C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a,\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a) \rightarrow C^k(\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a,\hat{\mathbb{G}}_m)$ given by $g\mapsto 1+g$.

Indeed, using Lagrange's theorem this is trivial: There is no element of order 2 (since the order must divide the order of $G$, but it is odd), and so every element except $e$ has a unique inverse which is different from it. Hence both the element and its inverse participate in the product and cancel each other. My problem is simple - I need to solve this without Lagrange's theorem. So either there's a smart way to prove the nonexistance of an element of order 2 in an odd abelian group, or I'm missing something even more basic...","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

9323,Are there Zariski-continuous maps between algebraic sets that are not polynomial maps?,"Suppose that $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the vanishing sets of a system of polynomial equations in n variables over a field $\mathbb{k}$ (ideal in $\mathbb{k}[X_1,\dots,X_n]$) and a system of polynomial equations in m variables over a field $\mathbb{k}$ (ideal in $\mathbb{k}[Y_1,\dots,Y_m]$). We can give $S_1$ and $S_2$ the Zariski topology by letting all algebraic subsets of $S_1$ and $S_2$ to be closed. Surely, if $Y_j\circ f\colon S_1\to\mathbb{k}$ is a polynomial in $\mathbb{k}[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I(S_1)$, for every $j$, then $f$ is continuous in the Zariski topology. The condition that $Y_j\circ f$ be polynomial, however, seems too strict: as long as the vanishing set of $Y_j\circ f$ were equal to the vanishing set of a polynomial function, $f$ would be continuous, which means that the usual morphisms from $S_1$ to $S_2$ are not the same as the continuous maps between them as (Zariski-)topological spaces. My question then is of two parts. Is it true that there exist Zarsiki-continuous maps that are not polynomial? If yes, then what is the geometric way of thinking about the extra structure that polynomial maps preserve, i.e. continuous maps squash subsets of $S_1$ in such a way that non-algebraic subsets never get squashed into algebraic ones, but some algebraic ones may get squashed into non-algebraic ones, but polynomials also give what features to the geometric squashing?","['zariski-topology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

In the Lovasz survey, this falls out as a byproduct of a lengthy calculation. I have two questions: (i) Is there a simple (calculation-free, combinatorial) proof of this statement?

9404,The Milnor Conjecture on the Unknotting Number of a Torus Knot,"Let $f \colon (\mathbb{C}^{n},\mathbf{0}) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$ be a complex analytic function with isolated critical point at the origin. Define the singular hypersurface $V_{f, \kappa} = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for small $\kappa > 0$. Let $\pi \colon \tilde{V} \to V$ be a resolution of $V = V_{f,0}$, and let $p_{g} = \dim H^{n-2}(\tilde{V}, \mathcal{O})$ denote the corresponding geometric genus of $V$, which is independent of the chosen resolution. (This is the same geometric genus in the Yau-Durfee Theorem: $\mu \geq n! \ p_{g}$ for $n > 2$, See Y93 or Y06 .) Define the map $\varphi_{f} = f/\| f \| \colon S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1} \setminus V_{f, \kappa} \to S^{1}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small. The intersection of $V_{\kappa}$ with a small sphere $S_{\epsilon}^{2n-1}$ is an algebraic link. Consider the Brieskorn-Pham polynomial $f = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} z_{i}^{a_{i}}$ with $a_{i} \geq 2$. In particular, for $f = z_{1}^{p} + z_{2}^{q}$, the intersection above is a torus knot $T_{p,q}$ if $p$ and $q$ are coprime. In 1968, Milnor conjectured that the unknotting number $u(T_{p,q})$ is related to the dimension of the local algebra $A_{f} = \mathbb{C}[x,y] / \langle x^{p-1}, y^{q-1} \rangle$, which is also the rank of the middle homology group $H_{1}(F_{f,0}; \mathbb{Z})$ of the corresponding fiber $F_{f,0} = \varphi_{f}^{-1}(e^{i \theta})$. In 1928, Brauner proved $\mu(f) = \text{rank} \ H_{1}(F_{f,0}, \mathbb{Z}) = (p-1)(q-1)$ for $f = x^{p} + y^{q}$. In 1994, Kronheimer and Mrowka proved the Thom conjecture, and as a consequence, the Milnor conjecture followed. (Edited) Question(s) : Is the genus $g$ of the fiber $F_{f,0}$ related to the geometric genus $p_{g}$ of $V$ for $n > 2$? Is there a geometric genus-like object for $n = 2$?

I have no doubt that they are useful to the understanding of some mathematical structures and add to the whole body of knowledge of mathematics as a whole. Sometimes, however, I find myself looking at these constants and I feel unsatisfied. I suspect that more constants can be expressed in more 'fundamental' constants like $\pi, e$ and $\gamma$. Although Euler probably came close to be a living one, mathematicians of the past did not have computers. We can now use computers to determine te value of the afore mentioned constants with great precision. We can also try to conjecture the exact value of these constants by finding the value of some arithmetic combination of $\pi, e$ and $\gamma$ and the real numbers that corresponds to one of the 'unevaluated' constants with high precision.
