2124232,"Formula for a ""Fairness Variance""","Short question : Propose a formula to apply on x0, x1, x2, ..., xn that returns a number which can sort these 7 datasets in this order: Medium question : Given 3 datasets, I want to have a formula that returns a number to represents the ""(un)fairness"" of a dataset , so I can sort/compare the datasets on that. Let's define fairness as the best situation for the worst, then the best situation for the second worst, and so on . For example, suppose we want to make assigning 15 shifts to 5 employees as fair as possible. In the above example, the middle dataset is the fairest, because the employee worst off (most shifts, so purple), is the best off (least shifts, only 5 in the middle dataset). However, if we calculate the variance ( 2.8 ) on these datasets, the second and third dataset have the same number. Is there a formula for number (let's call it Fairness Variance for now) that would allow us to sort these datasets on fairness? Long question : See this blog article which demonstrates that all common formula's (including standard deviation etc) don't work properly. Does such a formula even exist? Can anyone prove it does or doesn't?","['statistics', 'variance']"
2124239,Normal derivative of a $H^1$- Sobolev function,"Let $u\in H^1(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Lipschitz boundary. We denote the outward unit normal as $n$, defined a.e. on $\partial\Omega$, and the normal derivative of $u$ as $$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}:=\nabla u\cdot n.
$$ Which space does the normal derivative belong to? Is it possible to show $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\in L^2(\partial\Omega)$? I think it's not possible if we don't require at least that $u\in H^2(\Omega)$. Indeed it is easy to get $$
\|\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\|_{L^2(\partial \Omega)}\le \|\nabla u \|_{L^2(\partial \Omega)}.
$$ By the Trace theorem, we know that $\nabla u \in L^2(\partial\Omega)$ if $\nabla u\in H^1(\Omega)$, i.e. $u\in H^2(\Omega)$. Note that my notation is quite messy when I deal with the norm of the gradient...","['functional-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces']"

2124359,"Proof that the Lorentz Group SO(3,1) is a manifold","I am trying to prove that the Lorentz group $SO(3,1)$ is a Lie group. To prove that it is a manifold, I was thinking of proving that it is a closed subgroup of $GL(4,\mathbb{R})$. Firstly, I have not convinced myself that it is in fact closed. If it is, I am not sure how to start that proof. I have also considered proving it is a manifold by means of the constant-rank level set theorem in the way that O(n) is proven to be a regular submanifold of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ by devising a constant rank map $f: GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ of which $SO(3,1)$ is the inverse. However, I have yet to find such a map. Does anyone have any hints to get me started on this proof, or a link to an alternate proof? edit: I am now thinking that the best route to take is to prove that $SO(3,1)$ is the zero set of polynomial equations on $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. If I can show that, then I can prove that $SO(3,1)$ is closed. However, the definition of $SO(3,1)$ is more complicated than that of $O(n)$ or $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$, so I am still stuck on this proof.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'group-theory', 'lie-groups']"

2124622,When can two matrices have zero diagonal in the same basis?,"It's common to ask if two Hermitian matrices $A$ and $B$ can be diagonalized in the same basis. Is there an efficient way to check if they can be made hollow in the same basis? By hollow, I mean that the diagonal elements are all $0$. As esoteric as this sounds, I've had it come up in an experimentally relevant physics problem. Potentially useful aspects I have understood so far (I am only concerned with Hermitian matrices): $A$ can be transformed into a hollow matrix iff $\operatorname{Tr}[A]=0$ (see this post ) To find a basis in which $A$ is hollow, find a non-degenerate, full rank Hermitian matrix $Q$ that satisfies $\operatorname{Tr}[A Q^N] = 0$ for $N=0,\ldots,\dim(A)-1$. $A$ is hollow in the eigenbasis of $Q$. In principle, the second fact could be used to solve the problem, however I would like a method to check if a solution exists that is simpler than finding the solution, analogous to how $AB-BA = 0$ tests if $A$ and $B$ can be simultaneously diagonalized.","['matrices', 'diagonalization', 'linear-algebra']"

2124670,Why does one have to check if axioms are true?,"In Tao's book Analysis 1 , he writes: Thus, from the point of view of logic, we can define equality on a [remark by myself: I think he forgot the word ""type of object"" here] however we please, so long as it obeys the reflexive, symmetry, and transitive axioms, and it is consistent with all other operations on the class of objects under discussion in the sense that the substitution axiom was true for all of those operations. Does he mean that, if one wants to define define equality on a specific type of object (like functions, ordered pairs, for example), one has to check that these axioms of equality (he refers to these four axioms of equality as ""symmetry"", ""reflexivity"", ""transitivity"", and ""substitution"") hold in the sense that one has to prove them? It seems so, because of these two passages: [In section 3.3 Functions] We observe that functions obey the axiom of substitution: if $x=x'$, then $f(x) = f(x')$ (why?). (My answer would be ""because that's an axiom"", but Tao apparently wouldn't accept that.) And after defining equality of sets ($A=B:\iff \forall x(x\in A\iff x\in B)$), Tao writes (on page 39): One can easily verify that this notion of equality is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (Exercise 3.1.1). Observe that if $x\in A$ and $A = B$, then $x\in B$, by Definition 3.1.4. Thus the ""is an element of"" relation $\in $ obeys the axiom of substitution So he gives the exercise to prove the axioms of equality for sets. Why does one has to prove axioms?

} Addendum. As a sanity check  when $j=1$ the formula should produce
$n H_n$ for $n\ge 2.$ In fact we obtain $$\frac{n!}{n^{n-1}}
\left(n\times  
\sum_{p=0}^{n-2} \frac{(-1)^{n-2-p}}{p! (n-2-p)!}
\frac{(1+p)^{n-2}}{n-1-p}
+ \sum_{p=0}^{n-2} \frac{(-1)^{n-2-p}}{p! (n-2-p)!}
\frac{(1+p)^{n-1}}{(n-1-p)^2}\right).$$ For the first sum we introduce $$f(z) = \frac{(1+z)^{n-2}}{n-1-z} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q}$$ so that the sum is given by (residues sum to zero) $$\sum_{q=0}^{n-2} \mathrm{Res}_{z=q} f(z)
= -\mathrm{Res}_{z=n-1} f(z) - \mathrm{Res}_{z=\infty} f(z).$$ The contribution from the first term is $$\frac{n^{n-2}}{(n-1)!}$$ and
from the second $$\mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z^2}
\frac{(1+1/z)^{n-2}}{n-1-1/z} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1/z-q}
= \mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z^n}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-2}}{n-1-1/z} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{z}{1-qz}
\\ = \mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-2}}{n-1-1/z} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1-qz}
= \mathrm{Res}_{z=0}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-2}}{z(n-1)-1} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1-qz} = 0.$$ Hence the first sum contributes $$\frac{n!}{n^{n-1}} \times n \frac{n^{n-2}}{(n-1)!} = n.$$ For the second sum we use $$g(z) = \frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{(n-1-z)^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q}
= \frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{(z-(n-1))^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q}.$$ We get for the negative of the residue at $n-1$ the value $$-\left((1+z)^{n-1} \prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q} \right)'
_{z=n-1}
\\ = -\left((n-1)(1+z)^{n-2} \prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q} 
- (1+z)^{n-1} \prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q}
\sum_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{z-q}\right)_{z=n-1}
\\ = - \left((n-1)n^{n-2} \frac{1}{(n-1)!}
- n^{n-1} \frac{1}{(n-1)!} H_{n-1}\right).$$ Multiply by $n!/n^{n-1}$ to get $$n H_{n-1} - (n-1)n^{n-2} \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \frac{n!}{n^{n-1}}
\\ = n H_{n-1} - (n-1)\frac{n}{n} = n H_{n-1} - (n-1).$$ For the negative of the residue at infinity we obtain $$\mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z^2}
\frac{(1+1/z)^{n-1}}{(n-1-1/z)^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1/z-q}
= \mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z^{n+1}}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{(n-1-1/z)^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{z}{1-qz}
\\ = \mathrm{Res}_{z=0} \frac{1}{z^2}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{(n-1-1/z)^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1-qz}
\\ = \mathrm{Res}_{z=0}
\frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{(z(n-1)-1)^2} 
\prod_{q=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{1-qz} = 0.$$ Collecting everything we get $$n H_{n-1} - (n-1) + n = n H_{n-1} + n \frac{1}{n}$$ or alternatively $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid #00A000]{n H_n}$$ and  the sanity check goes through. Observe that we  evidently require
something more  sophisticated to  prove the conjectured  identity e.g.
when $j=n-1.$  (Remark.  We don't  need to actually apply  the formula
for  the residues  at infinity,  it  is sufficient  when working  with
rational functions  to observe  that both $f(z)$  and $g(z)$  have the
difference between the degree of  the denominator and of the numerator
equal to two.)","['stirling-numbers', 'coupon-collector', 'probability']"

The usual probability theory tells us that for a nice function $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ we have that $f(\langle X,h\rangle)$ and $f(\langle X,h'\rangle)$ are independent. Also that if $f$ is linear (or affine) $f(\langle X,h\rangle)$ is again Gaussian, but not in general, e.g., $f(\cdot)=|\cdot|$.

2125260,Writing a sampled differential equation as a difference equation?,"Some background/context A typical Linear Constant Coefficient Difference Equation (a.k.a. LCCDE, or recursive relation) might look like
$$y[n] = \frac 34y[n-1]-\frac 18y[n-2]$$
Which is sometimes written more suggestively:
$$y[n] - \frac 34y[n-1] + \frac 18y[n-2]=0$$
I've been learning how to solve these, and to my great surprise, there seems to be some kind of profound connection to differential equations. In the above example, the solution is as follows: Assume $y[n]=\lambda^n$ and plug in: (for brevity, some steps are skipped) $$\lambda^{n-2}(\lambda^2-\frac 34\lambda+\frac 18) = 0 \\
\lambda=\frac 12, \frac 14$$
So now we say that $y[n]=C_1(\frac 12)^n+C_2(\frac 14)^n$ What I'm trying to do I mean this is just screaming differential equations, so I'm trying to interpret an LCCDE as sampling an ODE's solution. I can get about this far: if we allow $p_1$ and $p_2$ (and in general, $p_k$) to be the roots of an ODE whose solution (sampled every $T_s$ seconds) is exactly equal to the above $y[n]$ , then we can say
$$e^{p_kt}|_{t=nT_s}=e^{p_kT_sn}=\lambda_k^n\ \\p_k=\frac{\ln(\lambda_k)}{T_s}$$
And in our specific example (if we just want a sampling interval of 1 second),
$$ p_1=\ln(\frac 12), p_2=\ln(\frac 14)$$
Working backwards even further, we can even write down the ""time-domain"" differential equation which has these roots in its characteristic (homogenous) equation:
$$y''(t)-\ln(\frac 18)y'(t)+\ln(\frac 14)\cdot \ln(\frac 12)\cdot y(t)=0$$ What my question is Unfortunately, the whole point of doing all this was because I'm trying to understand how LCCDEs can be so closely connected to ODEs. Given an LCCDE, I can convert to an ODE, but not without first solving all the roots and working backwards, which isn't helping me to see what's going on.

$$

It would be great if I could understand this for systems of two variables, but I would be deeply thrilled to understand it for systems of $n$ variables.

Background : I posted a question here about calculating the proportion $p(n)$ of an $n$-cube closer to the centre than to the outside, which seems to me like an interesting problem. The $n=2$ case is simple to solve in terms of the following integral: $$p(2)=2\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}-1}\frac{1-x^2}{2}-x\;dx=\frac{4\sqrt{2}-5}{3}$$ I was able to write $p(3)$ as follows: $$p(3)=6\int_{0}^{\frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}}\int_{z}^{\sqrt{2-z^2}-1}\frac{1-x^2-z^2}{2}-x\;dx\;dz$$ and I managed to evaluate this to $\frac{5}{4}-\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{8}+\frac{\pi}{4}$, but I was not able to use my method to solve the problem for higher dimensions. In the comments, however, achille hui made a proposition that we have $p(n)=\gamma(n-1)$ for all $n$ and although I still do not perfectly understand his reasoning, the claim does check out numerically for the two values I know already. Furthermore, the new integral is in a nice simple symmetric form (unlike the methods I had been using which required a case-by-case analysis for every dimension, with ugly bounds on the integrals), which makes me hope for a solution method.

If $ f(a) < 0 < f(b) $, then there exists an integer $ c \in (a, b) $ such that $ f(c) = 0 $. And the proof for this theorem was given as follows: Proof . Let $ S = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [a, b] : f(x) < 0\} $ and let $ c = \max S + 1 $. We claim that $ f(c) = 0 $. Say $ f(c) < 0 $. Then $ c \in S $.

2125547,Finite field extension with no non-trivial subextension,"Is there a field extension $K/F$ of degree $n>1$ with $n$ not prime, such that every element $x \in K \setminus F$ has degree $n$ ?
  What happens if $F$ has characteristic $0$? The motivation of this question is to notice that if $[K:F]=p$ is prime (or $=1$), then any element $x \in K\setminus F$ has degree $p$, and in particular $K/F$ has no non trivial subextension (actually there is a proper subextension $F \subsetneq L \subsetneq K$ iff there is some $x \in K$ of degree $\neq 1, \neq n$). My question is about the converse of this property. Obviously if $n$ is not prime, we can find some non trivial $F$-vector subspaces, but they might not be subfields of $K$.
I tried to work with subfields fixed by subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$, but this group may be trivial! If $K/F$ is separable (e.g. $\mathrm{char}(F)=0$), then we can write $K=F(a)$. But $a^2$ or some polynomials in $a$ might also have degree $n$ over $F$, and I don't see how to get a polynomial $P(a) \in K \setminus F$ in $a$ with degree $<n$ (which would solve my problem). I know that the degree of any $x \in K$ over $F$ must divides $n$, but the converse doesn't hold (even if $K/F$ is Galois ; related to the fact that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order $6$). I know that $F(X)/F$ has no non-trivial finite subextension (as well as any purely transcendental extension), even if $F(X^2)/F$ is a proper (infinite) subextension.

is the Riemann curvature tensor, then the only independent trace of $R$ is the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}=R^\sigma_{\mu\sigma\nu}$, since the trace $R^\sigma_{\sigma\mu\nu}$ is zero. If we are, on the other hand, given an arbitrary linear connection, it is necessarily a $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-connection, and there is nothing specific to be said about the first two indices of the curvature tensor, so the tensor field $Q_{\mu\nu}=R^\sigma_{\sigma\mu\nu}$ is not necessarily zero. What is there to be said about this tensor? What is its geometric meaning? What does it signify that for a Riemannian curvature tensor, this is zero? I do realize that if $\nabla$ is an arbitrary $g$-compatible connection then, for and arbitrary frame $e_{a}$ (latin indices - frame indices, greek indices - coordinate indices) we have $$d^\nabla g_{ab}=0=dg_{ab}-\omega^c_{\ a}g_{cb}-\omega^c_{\ b}g_{ac},$$ so $dg_{ab}=\omega_{ba}+\omega_{ab}$, so if $e_a$ is an orthonormal frame then the connection forms are skew-symmetric, and then the curvature form $\Omega^a_{\ b}=d\omega^a_{\ b}+\omega^a_{\ c}\wedge\omega^c_{\ b}$ is also skew-symmetric. Moreover, since unlike $\omega$, $\Omega$ is gauge-covariant, this skew-symmetry is preserved even if calculated in a non-orthonormal frame. Therefore, if $Q_{\mu\nu}$ does not vanish, then $\nabla$ cannot be metric-compatible for any metric I assume. But I am curious about more info. Does the vanishing of $Q$ also imply that $\nabla$ is metric compatible for some metric? What else can be said about $Q$?","['connections', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"

2125636,Symplectic but not Hamiltonian Vector Fields,"In symplectic geometry, given a manifold $M$ with closed nondegenerate symplectic 2-form $\omega$ , it is known that a vector field $X$ is Hamiltonian if $$\iota_X\omega=dH$$ for some smooth function $H\in C^\infty(M)$ . A vector field is symplectic if it preserves the symplectic structure along the flow, i.e. $$\mathcal L_X\omega=0\,.$$ One of the easiest ways to check them is to note that if $X$ is symplectic then $\iota_X\omega$ is closed, and if $X$ is Hamiltonian then $\iota_X\omega$ is exact. Consequently, all Hamiltonian vector fields are symplectic but the converse is not true. Locally, however, Poincare lemma guarantees that every symplectic vector field is Hamiltonian. Now consider symplectic 2-torus $(\mathbb T^2,d\theta\wedge d\phi)$ and a vector field $$X=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\,.$$ Using the first de Rham cohomology, one usually concludes that $X$ is not Hamiltonian. However, I am unsure why: note that $\iota_X\omega=d\phi$ , so it looks to me this is exact. Of course, we see that $\phi$ is not globally defined on $\mathbb T^2$ , so perhaps this is not correct. But this argument would seem to imply that for symplectic 2-sphere $(S^2,d\theta\wedge d\phi)$ , $X$ is not Hamiltonian (even though it should be, since it is symplectic and $$H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(S^2)=0\,.$$ Another example: Consider symplectic 2-sphere $(S^2,d\theta\wedge dh$ ), where $H(\theta,h)=h$ is a height function. In this case, the same vector field $X$ is Hamiltonian , since we obtained the required smooth Hamiltonian function $H$ . Now I reverse the problem: consider another 2-torus $(\mathbb T^2,d\theta\wedge dh)$ and the same vector field $X$ . Now it looks like $X$ is Hamiltonian, even though we know $$H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(\mathbb T^2)\neq0\,.$$ From my (naive) understanding, $H^1_{\text{de Rham}}(M)$ should be the only obstruction for a symplectic vector field to be Hamiltonian vector field, and not on the choice of the symplectic 2-form.

For the first example, for instance, it may have to do with seeing that $d\phi$ is not exterior derivative of $\phi$ , which I may have misunderstood.","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

I'd like to know how this is supposed to help us answer elementary number-theoretic questions. I know two examples of how Galois group helps elementary number theory, but I cannot extract the general reason why it is effective from these examples. Primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$ : In order to find primes $p$ of the form $p=x^2+ny^2$, we need to use class field theory, where Galois group is compared to ideal class group. There is a book about this topic. Fermat's Last Theorem : This was proved through showing that a solution $a^n+b^n=c^n$ implies that $y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n)$ is not modular, whereas actually every elliptic curve is modular (induces Galois representation that is also induced by modular form). Thus, the key link between elementary number theory (solving $a^n+b^n=c^n$) and Galois representation here is the non-modularity of Frey curve. As far as I know, such non-modularity is not trivial, and thus it is again mysterious to me why Galois representation is important for elementary number theory. What is the universal reason why Galois group helps us solve diophantine equations or deal with quesitons about primes? This question was already asked , and redirected to this MO question . However, I don't think that the question is answered satisfactorily (it does mention that Galois representation helps us understand Galois group, but I can't really understand from the answer why Galois group helps us do number theory), so I'd like to ask for an answer once again.","['number-theory', 'galois-representations']"

Here I mean ""exactly one"" in a strict sense, i.e. I don't allow ""up to (field / $F$-algebra) isomorphisms"". But a solution with ""exactly one up to field (or $F$-algebra) isomorphisms"" would also be welcome. I'm very interested in the case where $n$ has two distinct prime factors.

=\left\{L/\Bbb Q \text{ algebraic extension} \mid \sqrt[p^r]{2} \not \in L \text{ and } \zeta_{p^r} \in L \right\}

$$
F \subsetneq K \text{ and } K/\Bbb Q \text{ algebraic extension} 
\implies 
\exists x \in S,\; x \in K \implies  \exists x \in S,\; F \subsetneq F(x) \subseteq K

But $X^{p^r}-2$ is the minimal polynomial of any $x \in S$ over $F$ : it is irreducible over $F$ because $2$ is not a $p$-th power in $F$.
Therefore $F(x)$ has degree $p^r$ over $F$ and using the implications above, we conclude that $F(x) = F(\sqrt[p^r]{2})$ is the only extension of degree $p^r$ of $F$, when $x \in S$. Assume now that we want to build a field $F$ with the desired property for some $n=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{n_i}$. I tried to do some kind of compositum, without any success.
I have some trouble with the irreducibility over $F$ of the minimal polynomial of some $x \in S$ ($S$ suitably chosen) over $\Bbb Q$...

2125882,Distribution of interarrival times in a Poisson process,"I am new to Statistics. I am studying Poisson process, I have certain questions to ask. A process of arrival times in continuous time is called a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$ if the following two conditions hold: The number of arrivals in an interval of length $t$ is $\text{Pois}(\lambda t)$ random variable. The number of arrivals that occur in disjoint time intervals are independent of each other. Let $X_1$ denote the time of first arrival in a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$. Let $X_2$ denote the time elapsed between the first arrival and the second arrival. We can find the distribution of $X_1$ as follows:
$$\mathbb{P}(X_1>t)=\mathbb{P}\left(\text{No arrivals in }[0,t]\right)=\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda t}$$
Thus $\mathbb{P}(X_1\le t)=1-\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda t}$, and hence $X_1\sim\text{Expo}(\lambda)$. Suppose we want to find the conditional distribution of $X_2$ given $X_1$. I found the following discussion in my textbook. $\begin{equation}\begin{split}\mathbb{P}(X_2>t\mid X_1=s) & = \mathbb{P}\left(\text{No arrivals in }(s,s+t] \mid \text{Exactly one arrival in [0,s]} \right) \\
& =\mathbb{P}\left(\text{No arrivals in }(s,s+t]\right)\\
&=\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda t}\end{split}\end{equation}$. Thus, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, and $X_2\sim\text{Expo}(\lambda)$. However, I have the following questions regarding the above discussion. Since $X_1$ is a continuous random variable, $\mathbb{P}(X_1=k)=0$ for every $k\in\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\mathbb{P}(X_1=s)=0$. In other words, we are conditioning on an event with zero probability. But when I studied conditional probability, conditioning on events with zero probability was not defined. So in this case, is conditioning on an event with zero probability valid? Second, assuming that conditioning on $X_1=s$ is valid, what we have found is the conditional distribution of $X_2$ given $X_1=s$.

Attempt: Here are two methods I tried: I calculated up to 3rd differential and obtained a differential equation. $$\begin{align}
y&=C_1\sin^2x+C_2\cos2x+C_3\\
y'&=C_1\sin2x-2C_2\sin2x\\

&=-4(C_1\sin2x-2C_2\sin2x)\\
&=-4y'
\end{align}$$ I differentiated both sides w.r.t. $x$ and then sent the $\sin2x$ term, which I was getting in RHS, to LHS and wrote $\frac1{\sin2x}$ as $\operatorname{cosec}2x$. Then I differentiated both sides again w.r.t. $x$. In this way, both $C_1$ and $C_2$ which remained after calculating 1st derivative become zero. $$\begin{align}
y&=C_1\sin^2x+C_2\cos2x+C_3\\

2126213,Simple way to prove that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}]=\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Easy way to show that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]$ (8 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Leting $\delta:=\sqrt[3]{2}$, prove that $\mathbb{Z}[\delta]$ is the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\delta)$. Here's what I've done: let $K:=\mathbb{Q}(\delta)$. Since $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=3$, then $1, \delta, \delta^2$ are $\mathbb{Q}$-linearly independent (in particular, they are $\mathbb{Z}$-independent). Since $1, \delta, \delta^2$ are integers of $K$, we have that $\mathbb{Z}[\delta]=<1, \delta, \delta^2>_{\mathbb{Z}}\subset\mathcal{O}_{K}$. To prove $\supset$, I did the following: if $z=a+b\delta+c\delta^2$ is an integer of $K$, its minimal polynomial $p(x)=x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0$ lies in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and has roots $\sigma_1(z),\sigma_2(z)$ and $\sigma_3(z)$, where \begin{align*} 
\sigma_1 &:\delta\mapsto\delta\\
\sigma_2 &:\delta\mapsto\omega\delta\\
\sigma_3 &:\delta\mapsto\omega^2\delta
\end{align*} are the embeddings fixing $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\omega^3=1$. Using Viète's relations we get: \begin{align*} 
 c_2&=-\sum_{i}\sigma_i(z)= -3a\\        
 c_1&= \sum_{i<j}\sigma_i(z)\sigma_j(z)=3a^2-6bc\\
 c_0&= -\prod_{i}\sigma_i(z)=-(a^3+2b^3+4c^3-6abc)
\end{align*} which gives us restrictions for $a, b, c$, since $c_0, c_1, c_2\in\mathbb{Z}$. Since $\delta z$ and $\delta^2 z$ are also integers of $K$, we calculate its respective minimal polynomials and find new restrictions for $a, b, c$. After a very tiresome case analysis, I could prove that $a, b, c\in\mathbb{Z}$, concluding the proof. This solution was given as a hint by the professor, and seems to me not very natural and, above all, way too long. My question is: is there a more natural and/or shorter solution for this?

How does banning impredicative definitions avoid Russell's Paradox?
