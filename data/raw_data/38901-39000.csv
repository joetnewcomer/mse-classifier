380992,Extension of prime ideal in $k[V]$ to $\mathcal{O}_P(V)$ is prime?,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $I\subset k[X_1,\cdots, X_n]$ be a prime ideal, $V=V(I) \subset \mathbb{A}^n$  a variety and $P=(a_1,\cdots, a_n)\in V.$ Recall that $\mathcal{O}_P(V)$ is the set of rational functions from $V$ to $k$ defined at $P.$ Suppose $J\subset k[V]$ is a prime ideal of the coordinate ring $k[V] = \dfrac{k[X_1,\cdots, X_n]}{I}$ and that $J$ is contained in the maximal ideal $ \dfrac{ (X_1-a_1, \cdots, X_n-a_n)}{I}$. I want to show that $J' := J\mathcal{O}_P(V)$ is a prime ideal of $\mathcal{O}_P(V).$ Here is my attempt: Let $r_1, r_2 \in \mathcal{O}_P(V)$ and write $r_i = \dfrac{p_i}{q_i}$ where $p_i, q_i \in k[V]$ (this form is unique up to associates since $k[V]$ is a UFD). Suppose $\dfrac{p_1p_2}{q_1q_2} \in J'.$ The $q_i$ are defined at $P$ so $q_1q_2\in \mathcal{O}_P(V)$ so $p_1p_2\in J'.$ Now these $p_1,p_2$ are in $k[V].$ I think I want to use the primality of $J$ to get that $p_1$ or $p_2$ is in $J'$ from which I can conclude that $J'$ is prime. But how do I get $p_1\in J'$ or $p_2\in J'$? This approach may be totally wrong, I can't see where $J$ being contained in the maximal ideal that corresponds to $P\in V$ is used. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

381066,Showing that this set of functions is a group.,"I have trouble understanding the following task: Show that the set $X = \{f_1,\ldots ,f_6\}$ of functions $f_i : \Bbb Q\setminus \{0,1\} \to \Bbb Q\setminus \{0,1\}$ with $x ↦ f_1(x) = x$, $x ↦ f_2(x) = 1/x$, $ x ↦ f_3(x) = 1-x,$ $x ↦ f_4(x) = 1/(1-x)$, $ x ↦ f_5(x) = (x-1)/x$, $x ↦ f_6(x) = x/(x-1)$ and the composition as the operation is a group. Is this group commutative? I'm a little confused as I don't know what to do with all these functions. I can't apply the definitions of a group on this because of that.

381074,dividing planar regions into congruent parts,"I've been looking for counterexamples, with no success, to this for a few days running: Suppose for a planar region $R$ with finite positive area, there is a
  point $x$ where all lines of rational slope, through $x$, divide $R$

  divides $R$ into two congruent parts? My intuition says (which may be wrong) I can approximate a line with irrational slope by a sequence of lines with rational slope, each which divides our region into two congruent parts. I really think I'm missing big things in this approach.",['geometry']
381075,Jordan normal form theorem - a question about the proof I've found,"I've been reading this proof of Jordan's theorem: http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~holzmann/notes/jordan.pdf and there are a few questions I hope you could answer for me. Firstly, why $(A_{\lambda})_{\mu _i} = A _{\lambda + \mu _{i}} =: A _{\lambda_{ \ i}}$ and secondly, how do we know that $\dim (W \cap Ker A_{\lambda}) \ge 1$? The problem in the first question is that I'm not sure what $(A_{\lambda})_{\mu _i}$ means. Thank you. I understand that we pick a vector $v\neq 0$ with an eigenvalue $\lambda$. $A$ is $n \times n$ $A_{\lambda} = A - \lambda I \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ A_{\lambda}v=0,$ so we have $r = \dim \ker A_{\lambda}>0$ $\dim \ range A_{\lambda} = n-r<n $ , $W := range \ A_{\lambda} $ I undestand that because $W := range \ A_{\lambda} $, then $ A_{\lambda} (W) \subset W$, so 
$A_{\lambda} $ induces $T: W \rightarrow W$ and we can apply inductive hipothesis to its matrix. What I don't understand is why all of a sudden there are $\lambda_i$ over the arrows and it is probably because I don't know what $(A_{\lambda})_{\mu _i}$ means","['jordan-normal-form', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
381088,If $f\left(x\right)=\int\limits _{0}^{x}f\left(t\right)dt$ then $f \equiv 0$?,"$f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is a function that for all $0\leq a<b\in \mathbb R$, $f_{|[a,b]}:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb R$ is integrable.
assuming that for all $x\in[0,\infty)$ , $f\left(x\right)=\int\limits _{0}^{x}f\left(t\right)dt$ then $f\equiv0$ my attempt: First we know that $f\left(x\right)=\int\limits _{0}^{x}f\left(t\right)dt$ so $f(x)$ is an anti derivative of itself and continuous on $[0,\infty)$ 
$$
f\left(x\right)	=	\int\limits _{0}^{x}f\left(t\right)dt\Rightarrow f\left(x\right)-f\left(0\right)=f\left(x\right)
	\Rightarrow	f\left(0\right)=0
$$
Now according to Mean value theorem because $f$ is continuous and derivative on $[0,\infty)$ there exists $c\in[0,\infty)$ and
$$
f(c)=\frac{f\left(x\right)-f\left(0\right)}{x}\Rightarrow f\left(c\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{x}

381100,When does it hold that $\int_{0}^{x} fg=\left(\int_{0}^{x} f\right)\left(\int_0^x g\right)$,"I was wondering when it held that $$\int\limits_0^x fg=\left(\int\limits_0^xf\right)\left(\int\limits_0^xg\right)$$ Let $$P:= x \mapsto \int\limits_0^x fg$$
$$F:=  x \mapsto \int\limits_0^x f$$
$$G:= x \mapsto \int\limits_0^x g$$ The equality becomes $$P=FG$$ Obviously $f\equiv 0$ or $g\equiv 0$ are solutions. But are there other solutions? If you search for solutions of the form $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} a_nx^n$$
$$g(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} b_nx^n$$ You get $$fg(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$$
$$P(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}C_nx^n$$
$$F=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} A_n x^n$$
$$G=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} B_n x^n$$
$$FG(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} D_n x^n$$ where $$\forall n \in \Bbb N, c_n=\sum_{k=0}^na_kb_{n-k}$$

$$\forall n \in \Bbb N, D_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^nA_kB_{n-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}A_kB_{n-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\cfrac{a_{k-1}}{k}\cfrac{b_{n-k-1}}{n-k}$$ And the equality becomes $$\forall n \in \Bbb N, C_n=D_n$$ We always have that $$C_0=0=D_0$$ But we also have $$0=D_1=C_1=a_0b_0$$. Since the problem is symmetric in $f$ and $g$ and hence in $a_n$ and $b_n$, we can assume WLOG that $a_0=0$. Which gives $$C_{n} = \cfrac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}a_kb_{n-k-1}\right)$$ So then the equality becomes $$\forall n\in \Bbb N, \cfrac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}a_kb_{n-k-1}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\cfrac{a_{k-1}}{k}\cfrac{b_{n-k-1}}{n-k}$$ And then I'm not sure what I should do... And I'd also like to know if there are solutions that aren't of this form. Thank you in advance for your answers.",['integration']
381111,Generalizing Ramanujan's sum of cubes identity?,"Ramanujan's sum of cubes identity is defined by the generating functions, $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n &= \frac{1+53x+9x^2}{R_1}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n &= \frac{2-26x-12x^2}{R_1}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n &= \frac{2+8x-10x^2}{R_1}\\
d_n &= (-1)^n
\end{aligned}\tag{1}$$ (correcting a small typo in Mathworld), where $R_1 = 1-82x-82x^2+x^3$, then, $$a_n^3+b_n^3 = c_n^3 + (-1)^n\tag{2}$$ It turns out the $a_n, b_n, c_n, d_n$ can also be expressed as, $$\begin{aligned}
a_n &=-9p^2+176pq-851q^2 = 1,135,11151,\dots\\
b_n &=4(3p^2-56pq+263q^2) = 2,138,11468,\dots\\
c_n &=2(5p^2-90pq+409q^2) = 2,172,14258,\dots\\
d_n &= -(p^2-85q^2) = 1, -1,1,-1\dots
\end{aligned}\tag{3}$$ and {$p,q$} are chosen to satisfy the Pell equation $p^2-85q^2 =\mp 1$. (Actually, $p,q$ are half-integers since one can use $p^2-85q^2 =\mp 4$.) Ramanujan missed using {$p,-q$} which yields the different, $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n &= \frac{9+53x+x^2}{R_1}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n &= \frac{-12-26x+2x^2}{R_1}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n &= \frac{-10+8x+2x^2}{R_1}

But there are an infinite number of quadratic parametrizations to (2) given by, $$(ax^2-v_1xy+bwy^2)^3 + (bx^2+v_1xy+awy^2)^3 + (cx^2+v_2xy+dwy^2)^3 + (dx^2-v_2xy+cwy^2)^3 = (a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3)(x^2+wy^2)^3\tag{5}$$ and {$v_1,\, v_2,\, w$} = {$c^2-d^2,\; a^2-b^2,\; (a+b)(c+d)$}. For example, using {$a,b,c,d$} = {$6,-9,8,1$}, and tweaking (5) with a simple linear transformation so the last term transforms from $x^2-45xy+216y^2$ to $p^2-321q^2$ yields, $$\begin{aligned}
a_n &=3(3p^2-104pq+909q^2) = 3753, 693875529,\dots\\
b_n &=-2(4p^2-135pq+1119q^2) = 4528, 837313192,\dots\\
c_n &=6(p^2-37pq+348q^2) = 5262, 972979926,\dots\\
d_n &=p^2-321q^2  = 1,1,1,\dots
\end{aligned}\tag{6}$$ and {$p,q$} chosen to satisfy $p^2-321q^2 = 1$. With a few more terms, Mathematica's GeneratingFunction command was able to find, $$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n &= \frac{-9(417-5602x+x^2)}{R_2}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n &= \frac{8(-566-11315x+x^2)}{R_2}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n &= \frac{-6(877+6898x+x^2)}{R_2}
\end{aligned}\tag{7}$$ where $R_2 = -1+184899x-184899x^2+x^3$ and, $$a_n^3+b_n^3 = c_n^3 + 1$$ thus a sum of cubes identity analogous to Ramanujan's. (Using {$p,-q$} will yield the second family.) Question : Starting with an initial {$a,b,c,d$}, especially the form {$a,b,c,\pm1$}, and using the quadratic parametrization (5) where one term has been equated to $\pm1$, is it always possible to find a generating function analogous to (1)? (I've tried various {$a,b,c,d$} and it seems to be always the case, but a general proof eludes me.)

381171,How to solve partial integro-differential equation?,"Suppose the following partial integro-differential equation for a function $u(x,t)$ with $t\geq0$, $x \in [0,L]$: $\partial_t u = \partial_{xx} u + f(u,\lambda)$ $\lambda = B\left(u_0 - \int_{x=0}^L {u(x,t)dx} \right) = B \left(u_0 - <u> \right)$ (the latter for brevity). $B,u_0$ are constants. $B$ is the global interaction sensitivity, $u_0$ can be thought of as a measure of how much mass can go into $u$. $f$ has nice properties and can be assumed to be polynomial in $u$ and $\lambda$. E.g. take $f$ as $f(u, \lambda) = -u^3 + u + \lambda$ Assume nice initial and boundary conditions , e.g. $u(x,0) = u_i = \text{const}$ $\partial_t u(0,t) = \partial_t u(L,t) = 0$ (this problem is from: http://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1063/1.466399 ) How can I go about solving this? Is there a way to turn this equation into something more easily solvable? One approach I've tried was using the Laplace Transform with respect to $x$.
Here's my attempt doing this but I am far from avid with this technique so please correct me: $\mathcal{L}[\partial_t u](s) = \int_{0}^\infty{e^{-xs}\partial_t u(x,t) dx} = \partial_t \overline{u}(t | s) = \frac{d \overline{u}(t | s)}{dt}$, where I read $\overline{u}(t | s)$ as a function of $t$, given $s$ ($s$ is arbitrary but fixed as I understand). For the spatial derivative I get (using a table) $\mathcal{L}[\partial_{xx} u](s) = s^2 \overline{u}(t|s) - s u(0,t) - \partial_x u (0,t)$, and for $\lambda$ I am not sure what to do.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'laplace-transform', 'integro-differential-equations', 'integral-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

If one of the diagonals has length 5, find the area of the trapezium A 12 B 50/3 C 25/2 D 40/5 I guess the answer is C. I divided the trapezium into two triangles and then it is 5(x+y)/2, in which x+y=length of the diagonal, which is 5, so it's 5(5)/2. But what if it is a irregular trapezium? The diagonals will not be the same. I didn't use the altitude so I think my answer is wrong.

381194,"What software can calculate the order of $b \mod p$, where $p$ is a large prime?","I wasn't sure where to ask this, but Mathematics seems better than StackOverflow or Programmers. I have no background whatsoever in number theory, and I need to find software that can calculate the order of $b \mod p$, where $b = 2^{32}$ and $p$ is of the form $p = a * b^r + 1$.  I've calculated a number of suitable primes using NewPGen and PFGW (as well as Proth.exe), but I have no obvious way of calculating the order of $b \mod p$. Does anyone know of any program that can do this? Context, if needed: I read here ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760639/complimentary-multiply-with-carry-period/8781297#8781297 ) that calculating the order requires factoring $\phi(p) = p - 1$.  Then, for every factor $k$, the order of $b \mod p$ is the smallest $k$ such that $b^{(\phi(p)/k)}\mod p = 1$. Factoring $p - 1$ is easy in my case, since all of my candidates are already factored for the most part (except the $a$ term), but from what I understand I need not only the prime factors but ALL factors of $p - 1$, and it seems there will always be a ton of them when $b$ is a large power of $2$.  (I don't understand all of that post though, such as their calculation of the number of factors the original poster would have to test.) Unfortunately, I'm dealing with relatively large numbers here, e.g. $p = 131071 * 2^{864} + 1$.  In this example $a = 131071$ is mercifully prime, but there are $864$ different $2$ factors.  Naively trying every possible combination of the $865$ prime factors would presumably require calculating $b^{phi(p)/k}\mod p$ for, uh...$\sum_{i=1}^{865} 865!/(i!(865 - i)!)$ different $k$'s, which is more than anyone could calculate in the lifetime of the universe. Knowing $864$ of $phi(p) = p - 1$'s factors are all $2$'s makes things much more manageable, and we only need to try I think $1730$ different $k$'s ($1$ or $131072$ times anywhere from $0$ to $864$ factors of $2$).  If this post is anything to go by, I MIGHT be able to get away with testing only $k$'s containing all $864$ $2$ factors, but I could easily be wrong, since the presence of a non-$2$ factor might change things: Why 4 is not a primitive root modulo p for any prime p? . I don't know modular arithmetic though, so even if I only had to test a handful of $k$'s to obtain the order, there's no obvious way for me to calculate something as huge as $b^{(\phi(p)/k)}\mod p$ even once, when $b = 2^{32}$.  The numbers are just too big...so I need some software that knows how to do this sort of thing, preferably software that can calculate the order of $b \mod p$ straight out of the box. I've found a program that claims to be able to do this, but even the smallest and most trivial prime I'm interested in ($p = 255 * 2^{32} + 1$) is too big for it to handle: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Science-CAD/ORDER-OF-A-MODULO-P.shtml Additional Context: I'm trying to find suitable parameters for complementary multiply with carry (CMWC) generators, a class of random number generators invented by George Marsaglia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_with_Carry ).  These generators require a prime of the form $p = a * b^r + 1$, where $a$ is some multiplier, $b$ is the base, and $r$ is the lag of the generator (which increases the period).  The period of a CMWC generator is the order of $b \mod p$, and I'm trying to calculate the period of generators fitting the following description: $b = 2^{32}$, which allows the generator to natively return the full range of unsigned 32-bit numbers, without incurring the cost of a remapping output function. $r$ is in $[1, 32]$, with special emphasis on $r = 4, 8, 16, 32$.  $r$ controls the maximum possible period of the generator, but it also controls the amount of state that needs to be stored, and I'm looking for lightweight generators that come as close as possible to maximal period.  (Marsaglia calculated suitable parameters for smaller base-$2^{32} - 1$ CMWC generators, and he also provided parameters for smaller base-$2^{32}$ MWC generators...but the only base-$2^{32}$ CMWC generator he talked about was CMWC4827, with $r = 4827$...which is too large for my purposes.) $a$ can be anything, but things can be a bit more efficient if $a = 2^n \pm 1$.  I have a few candidate $a$'s that fit this description, but not for my preferred power-of-2 $r$ candidates, unfortunately.","['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'prime-factorization', 'math-software', 'prime-numbers']"

$$a_m=\log P(m)=\sum\limits_{k = 1}^m  {\log\,\left|\sin k\right|}$$
for any $k\in\mathbb{N}$ we have $0<\left|\sin k\right|<1$, so all terms of the sum above is strictly negative. I say that the sequence diverges: $\left\{a_m\right\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}\to\,-\infty$ This is a delicate point on which I have some doubts. I know that

For instance, could we define the derivative as the unique operator on differentiable functions such that The derivative operator is linear. That is, $D(cf) \equiv cD(f)$ and $D(f+g) \equiv D(f)+D(g)$. The chain rule holds. That is, $D(f \circ g)_x \equiv D(f)_{g(x)} \circ D(g)_x $. The product rule holds. That is, if $B : X \times Y \to Z$ is a continuous bilinear operator, then $(DB)_{(x,y)} (u,v) = B(u,y) + B(x,v)$. The derivative operator is the identity on bounded linear operators. That is, if $f: U \to V$ is defined by $f(x) = A(x)$ where $A$ is a bounded linear operator, then for all $x \in U$, $(Df)_x \equiv A$. Are these rules enough to precisely specify the derivative?

381472,What are generating functions?,"I have never really understood what generating functions are. I am trying to learn how they work in some counting problems; Take, for example,  this problem. If I were to find the number of non-negative integral solutions to the following equation $3a+4b+2c+d=20$, the standard trick (as seen in some places on the internet) is to take the product of the series $$\displaystyle (1+x^3+x^6+\dots)(1+x^4+x^8+\dots )(1+x^2+x^4+\dots)(1+x+x^2+\dots)$$ and find the coefficient of $x^{20}$.

If $a$ is 0, [let $A(x)=1+x^3+x^6+\dots$] then $A(x)=x^0=1$, if $a=1$, $A(x)=1+x^3$ as each $a$ contributes $3a$ to the sum.But I am still not sure what is being done.

381474,Is this a correct question?,"This is an exam question in functional analysis which for me doesn't make sense the way it is written. I am asking you if you agree with me on the modifications that needs to be done in the question. Question: Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed linear spaces and $T: X\rightarrow Y$ a linear operator. Recall that the dual $X^*$ of $X$ is the space of bounded linear functionals on $X$ with the norm $||\phi ||=sup\{|\phi (x) | :x\in X \textrm{ and } ||x||\leq 1 \}$. (Similarly for $Y$). Define $T^*:Y^*\rightarrow X^*$ by $[T^*(\phi )](x)=\phi (Tx)$ for $\phi \in Y^*$. Show that $||T^*||\leq ||T||$. My comments to the question: Define $T^*:Y^*\rightarrow X^*$ by $[T^*(\phi )](x)=\phi (Tx)$ for $\phi \in Y^*$. For me this doesn't make sense, but I understand it if one drops the $x$, i.e. $T^*:Y^*\rightarrow X^*$ by $T^*(\phi )=\phi T$ since then the domain and codomain makes sense, what worries me with the notation above is that $[T^*(\phi )](x)$ has no meaning since $\phi$ is not defined on $X$ and furthermore $\phi (Tx)$ is a scalar and not an element of $X^*$. Furthermore, I feel a bit ackward about talking about $||T||$ when $T$ is not assumed to be bounded, so I have assumed that. Is this correct or could we talk about $||T||$ in some general way when $T$ is not bounded? With this change of the question I understand the solution to it, I have added the indexes on the norms, so it is possible to follow my argument: $|| T^*(\phi )||_{X^*}=||\phi T||_{X^*}$ $=sup \{|\phi T x| : ||x||_{X}\leq 1 \}$ $\leq sup \{||\phi ||_{Y^*} || T ||_{B(X,Y)}||x||_{X} : ||x||\leq 1 \}$ $= ||\phi||_{Y^*} || T ||_{B(X,Y)}.$ Hence $|| T^*(\phi )||_{X^*}$ $\leq ||\phi||_{Y^*} || T ||_{B(X,Y)}$. Now, $||T^*||=sup \{|| T^*\phi ||_{X^*} : ||\phi ||_{Y^*}\leq 1 \}$ and hence letting $||\phi ||_{Y^*}\leq 1$ in the inequality $|| T^*(\phi )||_{X^*}$ $\leq ||\phi||_{Y^*} || T ||_{B(X,Y)}$ showes that  $||T^*||\leq ||T||$.

I would like to show that the rings $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ and $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$ are isomorphic. Explanation of terminology: $\mu_n \subset \mathbb{C}$ is the cyclic group of nth roots of unity, with multiplication as the group action. Pick $\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}$ to be a primitive nth root of unity, so that $\mu_n = \langle \epsilon \rangle$. To say that $\mu_n$ acts on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ with weights $(1,-1)$ means that the action of $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ is defined by setting $\epsilon \cdot u = \epsilon u$, $\epsilon\cdot v = \epsilon^{-1}v$ and extending polynomially. Define $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ to be the subring of $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ consisting of polynomials that are invariant under the given action of $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$. I want to show that there is an isomorphism of rings: $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n} \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$. My partial solution: $\mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_n}$ can be identified as the subring $\mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv] \subset \mathbb{C}[u,v]$. So the problem is to show that $\mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv] \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^n)$. There is a surjective ring homomoprhism $\varphi: \mathbb{C}[x,y,z] \to \mathbb{C}[u^n,v^n,uv]$ defined by $x \mapsto u^n, y\mapsto v^n, z \mapsto uv$. A direct check shows that $(xy-z^n) \subset \ker{\varphi}$. The difficulty: I am unable to show the reverse inclusion, $\ker{\varphi} \subset (xy-z^n)$. Any help will be appreciated. Is there another way to see that $\ker{\varphi} = (xy-z^n)$, without chasing inclusions? Thank you in advance. EDIT: Based on Alistair's answer below, here is how I understand one should proceed: suppose $\alpha$ (as defined below) lies in $\ker{\varphi}$, so that $\sum{a_{i,j,k}u^{ni+k}v^{nj+k}} = 0$ --- (1) . I want to show that $b_{i,j,k} \in \mathbb{C}$ can be chosen s.t. $(\sum{b_{i,j,k}x^iy^jz^k})(xy-z^n) = \alpha$ i.e. $\sum(b_{i-1,j-1,k} - b_{i,j,k-n})x^iy^jz^k = \alpha$. Apply $\varphi$ to this last equation and use linear independence of $u^av^b$ in $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ and equation (1) to get linear equations of the form: (expression in $b$s) = (expression in $a$s). Using these I can make a choice of $b$s, so that the equation $(\sum{b_{i,j,k}x^iy^jz^k})(xy-z^n) = \alpha$ is satisfied, thus proving the reverse inclusion.","['ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"
381540,Definition of prime ideal sheaf,"In the chapter I.3.3 of Eisenbud & Harris ""The Geometry of Schemes"" they give a definition of ""prime ideal sheaf"": Let $\mathcal{O}_S$ be the structure sheaf of a scheme $S$, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_S$-algebras. Then a prime ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{F}$ is a quasicoherent sheaf of ideals of $\mathcal{F}$, such that on eash open affine $U \subset S$ the ideal $\mathcal{I}_U$ is prime (or unit). After that they claim that prime ideal sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_S$ itself correspond to points of $S$. And here probably I miss some point, since I don't see why the following is not a counterexample. Consider the following non-separated scheme, presented earlier in the same book. Let $S$ be a scheme that is obtained by gluing two copies of the affine line $S_1 \simeq S_2 \simeq \mathrm{Spec} \, k[X]$ along the complement of $0$ (I mean the ideal $(X)$, of course) by identity morphism, and let $0_1$ and $0_2$ be the ""two zeroes"" of $S$. Then I think that the sheaf of ideals corresponding to the reduced two-point subscheme supported on $\{0_1, 0_2\}$ satisfies the definition of prime ideal sheaf, since no affine open subset can contain both points simultaneously. However, I don't think this sheaf of ideals deserves to be called prime, and it clearly violates their claim. So where am I wrong? Or if it is really a counterexample, what is the right definition then? Is it enough to add that $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{I}$ should have irreducible support? Edit: It turned out that in the (more recent) paper edition they only claim that for affine schemes.","['quasicoherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

How? Well the informal process of building subsets out of the ordered pairs, one-by-one. First $(a,d)$ implies a subset that contains $a,d$. then $(a,b)$ implies a subset that contains $a,b,d$ (by transitive property). then $(b,d)$ adds no information then $(c,c)$ implies a subset containing $c$. The unique result is the partition $\{a,b,d\}, \{c\}$. Am I doing something wrong or forgetting something crucial?","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Examples: 1) Hill's Spherical vortex $u = ( y(1-x^2-y^2), -x(1-x^2-y^2))$.
2) In 2d polar coordinates, $\nabla \cdot u = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\partial (r v_r )}{\partial r} = - \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta}$.

Assume that A does not have 1 as an eigenvalue. Show that the number of fixed points can be expressed in terms of the Trace of A only. Thoughts: The condition that $\Phi_A$ has a fixed point is equivalent to $A$ taking a point $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ to $(a+m,b+n)$ where $m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$. Multiplying the matrix by a vector $(a,b)$ with entries $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ we obtain equations $(a,b)=(\alpha a + \beta b, \gamma a + \delta b)$. Those can only differ by the addition of an integer, so $\beta = \gamma = 0$ and then the only two elements of the matrix left are the eigenvalues - the terms which are found in the Trace. and if A takes something to ($\alpha a, \beta b$) then $\Phi_A$ must take it to $(a,b)$ since they differ by an integer. I can't seem to get the equation for the # of fixed points out of this list of observations. Help appreciated, will upvote. EDIT: Solution If we substitute the A into its characteristic polynomial of A and use Cayley Hamilton, we get: $A^2(a,b)+tr(A)A(a,b)+1=0$ which is equivalent to $(a,b)+A(m,n)−tr(A)(a,b)−tr(A)(m,n)+(a,b)=0$ which we can solve for $(a,b)$ to get... $2−tr(A)(a,b)=(A+I−tr(A))(m,n)$. This line tells us that that $2−tr(A)(a,b)∈\mathbb{Z}$, i.e, $(a,b)$ are multiples of $12−tr(A)$ generated by some $(m,n).$ Furthermore, we have $(a,b)=12−tr(A)(A+I−tr(A)(m,n).$ The linear map on the right side has $detA=2−tr(A).$ That means that the unit parallelogram of the lattice has area $2−tr(A)$ and therefore in each unit square, there will be $2−tr(A)$ copies of the unit parallelogram lying inside the unit square. The lattice points lying inside the unit square are precisely those which don't differ by some $(m,n)∈\mathbb{Z}$. Since there are $2−tr(A)$ copies in the Unit square, we'll have 2−tr(A) corner points, and those points each correspond to an equivalence class of solutions.","['differential-topology', 'linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

\mathbf{R}=\left[
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
E_{x} & E_{y} & E_{z}\\
N_{x} & N_{y} & N_{z}\\

\begin{array}
[c]{l}%
\text{a unit vector which points away from}\\
\text{the centre of the earth (Gravity vector)}
\end{array}
\text{  .}
\end{align*}
$$ Once $\mathbf{R}$ has been calculated, the Android operating system will then calculate for you the Euler angles $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ where $$
\begin{array}
[c]{lll}%
\text{azimuth} & =\phi & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{G}\\
\text{pitch} & =\theta & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{E}\\
\text{roll} & =\psi & =\text{rotation about }\mathbf{N}

$$ The relationship between $\mathbf{R}$ and $(\phi$, $\theta$, $\psi)$ is given by $$
\mathbf{R}=\left[
\begin{array}

-\sin\psi\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & \cos\psi\cos\theta

\right]  \text{  .}
$$ The azimuth $\phi$ is a particularly important result, because $\phi=0$ corresponds to the direction of north. However, there is a well known problem with these Euler angles, which is known as Gimbal lock .  When $\theta=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ the co-ordinate system is denerate in the sense that the combination $\phi\pm\psi$ is defined, but the individual quantities $\phi$ and $\psi$ are not defined. In the context of smartphone apps, this means that determining the direction of north is tricky when the device isn't lying flat on a table.  The closer the device gets to being upright, the less reliable to co-ordinate system becomes. On stackoverflow.com some people recommend switching axes when $\theta$ moves away from $0$ so as to avoid Gimbal lock, but I find that that solution introduces other problems, such as jumps in $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ when the coordinate system is switched. So my question is, instead of $\phi$, $\theta$ and $\psi$ as defined above, is there a better way of defining an angular co-ordinate system for expressing the orientation of a smartfone relative to the vectors $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{G}$?  In particular, is there a coordinate system that's better for defining the direction of north, that will work whether the device is upright or lying flat on a table. Clarification Whatever the best methodology is, one result must be some kind of azimuth angle which can be explicitly calculated from the rotation matrix $R$, which represents the angle through which the device must be rotated so that it's pointing north.","['geometry', '3d', 'rotations']"
381651,Null spaces and projections,"I'm following Kreyszig's exposition of projections in ""Introduction to Functional Analysis with applications"". I'm trying to follow the proof of the following theorem (9.6-1 on pp. 486-487) regarding projections and their relationship to the following partial ordering: Definition (Partial ordering via $\leq$)
Take $T_{1},T_{2}:H\to H$ to be bounded self-adjoint linear operators
on a complex Hilbert space $H$. We write $T_{1}\leq T_{2}$ iff $\left\langle T_{1}x,x\right\rangle \leq\left\langle T_{2}x,x\right\rangle $
for each $x\in H$. Theorem Suppose
that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are projections on the Hilbert space $H$.
Let $P_{1}\left(H\right)$ and $P_{2}\left(H\right)$ be the subspaces
onto which $H$ is projected by $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Furthermore,
let $\mathscr{N}\left(P_{1}\right)$ and $\mathscr{N}\left(P_{2}\right)$
be the null spaces of $ $$P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, respectively. T.f.a.e.: 1) $P_{2}P_{1}=P_{1}P_{2}=P_{1}$; 2) $\left\Vert P_{1}x\right\Vert \leq\left\Vert P_{2}x\right\Vert ,\forall x\in H$; 3) $P_{1}\leq P_{2}$; 4) $\mathscr{N}\left(P_{2}\right)\subseteq\mathscr{N}\left(P_{1}\right)$; 5) $P_{1}\left(H\right)\subseteq P_{2}\left(H\right)$. I'm struggling to justify Kreyszig's justification for 4) implies 5). He uses the following Lemma, which I think I understand: Lemma The orthogonal complement $Y^{\perp}$ of a closed subspace
$Y$ of a Hilbert space is the null space $\mathscr{N}\left(P\right)$
of the orthogonal projection $P$ of $H$ onto $Y$. Indeed, to prove 4) implies 5), Kreyszig says, "" This is clear since $\mathscr N \left(P_j \right)$ is the orthogonal complement of $P_j(H)$ in $H$. "" I understand this to mean that we have that $\mathscr{N}\left(P_{i}\right)=\left(P_{i}\left(H\right)\right)^{\perp}$. Hence, from 4), $$\left(P_{2}\left(H\right)\right)^{\perp} \subseteq \left(P_{1}\left(H\right)\right)^{\perp}.$$ Am I right?

Here is the statement of the problem: Suppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over an infinite field $\mathbb{F}$. Suppose $V_1$, $V_2, \dotsc, V_n\leq V$ are subspaces of $V$ such that $\dim{V_1} = \dotsb = \dim{V_n}$. Show that there exists a subspace $S$ such that $V = V_i \oplus S$ for all $i$. (In other words, there exists a common complement for $V_i$.) Now, if $\mathbb{F}$ is something familiar like $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ I can use measure-theoretic arguments to prove this. I might even be able to get away with it for any field of characteristic 0. But over something like $\mathbb{F}_2(t)$ or any other infinite field that is not obviously a measure space, that won't work. And that certainly is not the proof that Roman is looking for. I think we want something like the proof he offers for Theorem 1.2 on p. 39, where he shows that a nontrivial vector space over an infinite field $\mathbb{F}$ is not a finite union of proper subspaces. Here he supposes $V = V_1 \cup \dotsb \cup V_n$ and for $w\in V_1 \setminus (V_2 \cup \dotsb \cup V_n)$ considers a set $A=\{rw + v \mid  r \in \mathbb{F}\}$, and shows that each subspace must contain at most one vector from this set.

381889,Calculating Probabilities for Substitution Ciphers using Frequency Analysis,"I have been trying to put together a tool that can take in cipher text encrypted via a simple substitution cipher and calculate the most likely ""key"" (that is, how the plain text letters were mapped to the cipher text letters). I think I've had some success with an approach I've been using, but I suspect it could be a lot better. What I've been doing to this point: For a given mystery letter (that is, that which appeared in the cipher text), I calculated that it actually decrypts to 'a', given the frequency that this mystery letter appears in the cipher text. I did that by using Bayes formula to render it as the likelihood that 'a' appears in the cipher text the number of times that the mystery letter does (knowing usual frequency of 'a' in English). In other words, if we denote $X$ as the mystery letter and $F_X$ denotes the frequency that $X$ appears, then: $$P(X = a \mid F_{X} ) = \frac{ P(F_X \mid X = a) P(X = a) }{ P(F_X) }$$ $P(F_X \mid X = a)$ can be easily calculated by using the binomial distribution mass function knowing the general frequency that 'a' appears in the English language. Without any other information, I assume that $P(X = a)$ equals $1 \over 26$. I neglected to divide by the bottom for reasons which I'll explain in a moment. Then I did the same for every other letter; that is $P(X = b \mid F_X), \ldots, P(X = z \mid F_X)$. I summed up all of what I had calculated for this mystery letter, and then divided each one by the sum, to complete the calculation for each possibility. Then I did the same for every other mystery letter. So, what I ended up with was a 26-by-26 matrix of probabilities that a mystery letter corresponded to a plaintext letter. It then becomes an assignment problem of selecting 26 elements, exactly one from each column and one from each row and trying to maximize probability for a particular key. What I don't like about this (beyond that I'm generally inexperienced and uneasy on this topic), is that I feel that I could definitely do better. Each probability calculated for a mystery letter only takes into account the frequency of that particular mystery letter, and not the frequency of other mystery letters. I've thought about trying to do this as a Bayesian Network, but I feel unsure if that is valid, and I'm having a hard time getting my mind around it.

381912,One question related with sequential compactness,"While trying to prove that a set is sequentially compact, I was suggested to prove by contradiction -- this is how it went, at least part of it: Definition . We say that a set $A$ is sequentially compact if every sequence $(x^m)$ with $\{x^m\}\subseteq A$ has a sequence $(x^{m_k})$ that $x^{m_k}\rightarrow x\in A$. Theorem . Being $(M,d)$ a metric space, a set $A\subseteq M$ is compact only and only if it is also sequentially compact. part of what you should assume for the demonstration . Suppose initially that $A$ is a compact set. Suppose too that the sequence $(x^m)$ is such that $\{x^m\}\subseteq A$ and $(x^m)$ does not possess any sequence that converges to any element of $A$. As we know that $A$ is a closed set, that implies that $(x^m)$ does not possess any convergent sequence in $(M,d)$. Actual Demonstration (part of it [the part I cannot understand]) . Begin trying to define $\{x^m\}$ as a closed set. Take $y\in M-\{x^m\}$ and suppose $\{x^m\}$ as a not closed set (implying $M-\{x^m\}$ as a not open set). Suppose that for every ε>0, and for every N, $B(y,ε)∩({(x^m):m≥N})≠∅$. For $k=1$, take $x^{m_1}\in\{x^m\}\cap B(y,1)\neq\emptyset$. Take $x^{m_2}\in\{x^m\}\cap B,(y,1/2)\neq\emptyset$, such that $m_2>m_1$. To see that this is possible, define $\delta:=\min(x^m,y)$. By hypothesis, $\{x^m\}\cap B,(y,\delta)\cap B(y,1/2)\neq\emptyset$; so we can take $x^{m_2}\in\{x^m\}\cap B,(y,\delta)\cap B(y,1/2)\neq\emptyset$. We can guarantee that $m_2>m_1$. Proceeding inductively in such manner, we can obtain a subsequence $(x^{m_k})$ of $(x^m)$ such that, for every $k$, $d(x^{m_k}, y)<1/k$. So $x^{m_k}\rightarrow y$. That is a contradiction with the statement $(x^m)$ does not have any converging subsequences. We conclude that $\{x^m\}$ is a closed set. Here it is what I haven't figured out : I don't know if I understood the whole demonstration correctly (or copied correctly from the board in my class), but how can we prove that $\{x^m\}$ is closed if a subsequence $(x^{m_k})$ of $(x^m)$ converges to a point outside of $\{x^m\}$, since $y\in M-\{x^m\}$? The trick was in assuming that $\{x^m\}$ didn't have any converging sequences in (M,d) and proving a contradiction in the demonstration. But how does  that make $\{x^m\}$ a closed set? I still cannot see what I am missing. Can someone point if I am understanding something wrong or if there is any correction to be made in this demonstration? Notation : I used $\{x^m\}$ as the set of the sequence $(x^m)$. If there are any questions about notation, please ask. Observations (edited) : I'm having some trouble in writing in this system -- I welcome any help.

 B = \frac{255}{217} \cdot 255 = 299$$ Obviously, the results are out of the range of my 8 bit colorspace. How to correctly solve this whitespace transformtation? I'm mainly lost as I have no idea how to handle the matrix within a cross-product.","['matrices', 'cross-product', 'transformation', 'image-processing']"
382079,Posterior density and posterior moments,"I would be very grateful to get some help with the following problem. Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be independent and uniformly distributed on the interval $(0,\theta)$ with $\theta>0$.
Let the prior density of $\theta$ be the log-normal distribution with parameters $(\mu,\sigma^2)$ where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma>0$ are known constants. I'm looking for a) the posterior density of $\ln{\theta}$, b) the k-th posterior moment of $\theta$, c) the maximum of the posterior density of $\theta$. I tried to solve a) as follows. Let $p(\theta)$ be the prior density of $\theta$ and $L(x_1, ..., x_n|\theta)$ the likelihood function of $\theta$ given the outcome $X_1=x_1, ..., X_n=x_n$. Then the posterior density $f(\theta|X_1=x_1, ..., X_n=x_n)$ is given by $$\frac{L(x_1, ..., x_n|\theta)p(\theta)}{N}$$ where $$N=\int_0^\infty L(x_1, ..., x_n|\theta)p(\theta) d\theta$$ is a normalizing constant. I have $$p(\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma\theta}\exp \left(-\frac{(\ln{\theta}-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$ and $$L(x_1, ..., x_n|\theta)=1/\theta^n$$ where $x_1, ..., x_n \in (0,\theta)$ and $0$ otherwise. Now I need to solve that integral, but I can't figure it out. Since we're asked to give the posterior density of $\ln{\theta}$, I tried to substitute $y=\ln{\theta}$ by using $$\theta^{-(n+1)}=\exp \left(\ln{\theta^{-(n+1)}}\right)=\exp \left(-(n+1)\ln{\theta}\right)$$ and simplifying the integral to $$N=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp \left(-(n+1)y+\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)dy.$$ However, I still can't solve that integral and feeding it to Wolframalpha didn't yield a result as well. Have I done something wrong or do I need to choose a completely different approach? So far I didn't care much about b) and c) since I need to solve a) in order to do them, I think.","['statistics', 'bayesian']"
382099,A possibly set theoretic question in general topology,"Let $A\subseteq \scr{P}$$(X)$$,B\subseteq$$\scr{P}$$( Y)$. Let $\tau_X$ be the smallest topology on $X$ that contains the set $A$. Let $\tau_Y$ be the smallest topology on $Y$ that contains the set $B$. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ satisfy: $$\forall V\in B[f^{-1}[V]\in A]$$ Does it follow that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous ? After trying to prove it and failing, I feel that that problem is set theoretic. However, I can't proceed further because all of my knowledge of set theory I got it from the first chapter of Munkres topology !","['general-topology', 'set-theory']"
382103,Fourier transform of a compactly supported function,"In which space does the Fourier transform of a smooth compactly supported function $\phi$ lie?
I would not say it lies in $\mathcal{S}$, heuristically as one can approximate the step function which is $1$ in $[0,1]$ and $0$ outside by smooth functions, and the Fourier transform of that function decays very slowly. What if I add the requirement that the integral average of $\phi$ is $0$? I would expect cancellation in the phase space, the higher the frequency, the higher the cancellation. Any hint would be appreciated!","['harmonic-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
382117,average is higher than percentile 90 ?...,"I have a few hundreds of results from a test im running, and with a utility I have that analyzes these results I can see that the Average result value is higher than the percentile 90th value... This seems a little weird to me, since I know that most of the results recorder (exactly 89%) are below the percentile 90 value, therefore i figure this means that the 10% of the results above the percentile 90 value are probably very far from the median. What else can this tell me about my results ? Details on the results : average = 550, percentile 90 = 540. A valid results could be anything from 1 up to anything.",['statistics']
