n2^n = 8

926455,Help explain the set being constructed in this Cantor-Schroder-Berstein proof,"The Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein theorem states that: Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. If $|A|\le |B|$ and $|B|\le |A|$, then $|A|=|B|$ Proof: So, $|A|\le|B|$ implies we can choose an injection $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B \rightarrow A$. Let $R=\text{Im}(g) \subseteq A$. Then, if we think of $g$ as a function from $B$ to $R$, it is a bijection and so is $g^{-1}:R \rightarrow B$. Here's the part I don't understand: We now define a sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$ by recursion as follows:
  $$A_1=A-R,$$
  $$\text{for every }n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, A_{n+1}=g(f(A_n))=\{g(f(a))|a\in A_n\}$$
  Let $X=\cup_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+} A_n$ and $Y=A-X$. Of course, every element of $A$ is in either $X$ or $Y$, but not both. Now define $h:A\rightarrow B$ as follows:
  $$h(a)=\left\{ 
\begin{align}
f(a), & \text{ if } a \in X \\
g^{-1}(a), & \text{ if } a \in Y
\end{align}
\right.$$
  Note that for every $a\in A$, if $a\notin R$ then $a\in A_1 \subseteq X$. Thus, if $a\in Y$ then $a\in R$, so $g^{-1}(a)$ is defined. Therefore, this definition makes sense. What does the sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$ look like and what is it suppose to represent? Is the union of it all suppose to partition the set $A$, the domain of $f$? I tried to sketch a small case but that didn't help at all as I end up having $f$ and $g$ being a surjection.","['proof-writing', 'infinity', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
926457,Plane curves isomorphic to the affine line,"Let $C$ be a plane curve parametrized by $x=f(t),y=g(t)$ where $f(t),g(t)\in k[t]$. We can easily see that the coordinate ring of $C$ is isomorphic to $k[f(t),g(t)]\subset k[t]$. So $C$ is isomorphic to the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$ if $k[f(t),g(t)]=k[t]$. For example, the curve given by $x=t+t^4,y=t^2$ is isomorphic to the affine line. My question is that whether all curves that are given by $x=f(t),y=g(t)$ with $k[f(t),g(t)]=k[t]$ are of such kind, i.e., satisfy a relation of the form $x-ay^n=bt+c$ or $y-ax^n=bt+c$ for some $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ and constants $a,b,c$? In algebraic terms, I am asking the following question: If $k[f(t),g(t)]=k[t]$, does it necessary that the relation of $f(t),g(t)$ and $t$ is of the form $f-ag^n=bt+c$ or $g-af^n=bt+c$?

I am given the adapted frame: $$\left\{\begin{array}{l} E_1 = \cos \varphi \cos \theta \newcommand{\ddx}{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}} \ddx + \cos \varphi \sin \theta \newcommand{\ddy}{\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} \ddy + \sin \varphi \newcommand{\ddz}{\frac{\partial}{\partial z}} \ddz \\ E_2 = - \sin \theta \ddx + \cos \theta \ddy \\ E_3 = -\sin \varphi \cos \theta \ddx - \sin \varphi \sin \theta \ddy + \cos \varphi \ddz \end{array}\right.$$
Among other stuff, I have already computed the connection $1$-forms: $$\omega_{12} = \cos \varphi \newcommand{\d}{ \ \mathrm{d}} \d \theta, \qquad \omega_{13} = \d \varphi \quad \mbox{and}\quad \omega_{23} = \sin \varphi \d \theta$$
and the dual $1$-forms: $$\theta_1 = \d r, \quad \theta_2 = r \cos \varphi \d \theta \quad \mbox{and}\quad \theta_3 = r \d \varphi$$
I already know that $\newcommand{\s}{\mathcal{S}} \s(v) := - \nabla_v E_1$, since $E_1$ is normal to the sphere. I also know that considering the patch $\mathbf{x}(\theta,\varphi) = (\cos \varphi \cos \theta,\cos \varphi \sin \theta,\sin \varphi)$ and working with $\mathbf{x}_\theta, \mathbf{x}_\varphi$ and $\mathbf{x}_\theta \times \mathbf{x}_\varphi$, we get that $\s(v) = -\frac{1}{r}v$. But I want to understand what is going wrong in this other approach. We have that $\s = - \nabla E_1 = -(\omega_{12}E_2 + \omega_{13}E_3) = \omega_{21}E_2 + \omega_{31}E_3$, fine. If I consider $$v = v^1 E_1 + v^2E_2 + v^3E_3$$
then we get: $$ \d \theta(v) = v^1 \d\theta(E_1) + v^2 \d \theta(E_2) + v^3 \d \theta(E_3) = \frac{1}{r \cos \varphi}v^2 \\ \mbox{and} \quad \d \varphi(v) = v^1 \d\varphi(E_1) + v^2 \d \varphi(E_2) + v^3 \d \varphi(E_3) = \frac{1}{r} v^3$$
That being said, we go for $\s(v)$: $$\begin{align} \s(v) &= \omega_{21}(v)E_2 + \omega_{31}(v)E_3 \\ &= -\cos \varphi \d \theta(v) E_2 - \d \varphi(v) E_3 \\ &= -\frac{1}{r}v^2 E_2 - \frac{1}{r}v^3E_3 \\ &=-\frac{1}{r}\left(v^2E_2 + v^3E_3\right)\end{align}$$ I'm not exactly sure what is going on. As I am done typing this, it came to my mind: maybe this IS correct, since $\s$'s domain is a tangent space to the sphere, and so $v^1 = 0$? Maybe my problem is with the notation.

I'd just like some clarification I'm on the right track with how to use this device. For example, suppose we were to have the following: $$f(z;y) = \frac{y^z}{z},$$ and I could see it would be beneficial to use the above device. Then I can write $$\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}f(z;y)dz = \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\frac{y^z}{z}dz.$$ However, am I correct in thinking I can't just go ahead and use the information in the curly brace. Instead, loosely speaking, I have to create a (probably square) contour, two corners of which are $c+i\infty$ and $c-i\infty$. Then I would need to check the top, bottom, and left line integrals go to zero (or else compute their values), and furthermore account for all residues at poles within the contour of the meromorphic function. Only then would I be able to use the information on the line integral given in the curly brace? EDIT Now I know the name of this device, I have found a related post .

There is an obvious embedding with $n=24$, and since $|\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)|=480$ and in $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ there are many elements with order $20$, we have $n\geq 9$. However, ""filling the gap"" between $9$ and $24$ looks hard, at least to me. Can someone shed light on the topic? I would bet that representation theory and Cayley graphs may help, but I am not so much confident to state something non-trivial. I think that proving that $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ is generated by three elements (is this true?) may help, too. I would be interested also in having a proof of something sharper than $9\leq n\leq 24$. Update. The following Wikipedia page claims, in paragraph Exceptional isomorphisms , that $\operatorname{PGL}(2,5)$ is isomorphic to $S_5$. This seems to suggest that $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ embeds in $\mathbb{Z}_4\times S_5$ that embeds in $S_9$. Am I right? Second Update. No, I am wrong, since $\mathbb{F}_{25}^*$ embeds in $\operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbb{F}_5)$, so there is an element with order $24$, so $n\geq 11$.","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"

I read on planet math website that every compact subset in this space has empty interior and then I tried to prove it. Please could someone tell me if my proof is correct? My proof: Let $K$ be compact in $\mathbb Q$ with the subspace topology of $\mathbb R$. By contradiction assume it contained an open set $O\subseteq K$. By the definition of the subspace topology there exists an open set $V\subseteq \mathbb R$ such that $O = V \cap \mathbb Q$. Now let $q \in O \subseteq V$. Since $V$ is open there exists an open ball $B$ such that $q \in B \subseteq V$. Let this ball be small enough so that it is also contained in $[m,M]$ where $M=\max K$ and $m = \min K$. Note that then $B \cap \mathbb Q\subseteq K$ The ball $B$ contains an irratinal $r$.  Since the irrationals are dense in the reals we can find a sequence of rationals in this ball converging to $r$. This sequence is contained in $K$. Hence $r$ is a limit point of $K$. Since $K$ is closed, $r \in K$, a contradiction.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

If every point could be connected by a straight line it would follow from the mean value theorem, so I guess for convex sets this is easy.

Does the possibility to connect every point together with a curve imply that every point can be connected with a finite number of straight lines, where each line is contained in the set? If so it is ok, but the last thing seems difficult to prove, how do you do it? update: If the set also is open, is it correct to say that for every point there is an open ball around that point. And in that open ball every straight line is contained. So the function is constant around every point in the set. And if two points where unequal we could connect those points by a curve, and on one point on that curve the value of the function has to change, and hence we have a contradiction, because in an open ball around this point we have two different values?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'real-analysis', 'connectedness']"

The coordinate should be found on the border of the circles and not that far away in space. As you might have guessed that I am trying to draw tangents between each circle.
