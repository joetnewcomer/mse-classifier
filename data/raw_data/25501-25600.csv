231236,Cardinality of Vitali sets: countably or uncountably infinite?,"I am a bit confused about the cardinality of the Vitali sets. Just a quick background on what I gather about their construction so far: We divide the real interval $[0,1]$ into an uncountable number of disjoint classes in such a way that two numbers $x$ and $y$ are in the same class if their difference x-y is a rational number. Therefore the equivalence relation on the real numbers would be: $x\sim y\iff x-y\in\mathbb Q$. The cardinality of our classes is equivalent to the cardinality of $\mathbb Q$, so the classes have countably infinite elements. How many of these classes are there? As each only has countably infinite elements, but each element of $[0,1]$ lies in one class, there are uncountably infinite classes. Now, using the axiom of choice, we take one element out of each class and put it in the set V. This is a Vitali set. Hopefully this is all good at this point. So each Vitali set should have uncountably many elements (because we have uncountably many classes), but there should be countably many Vitali sets (because each class has countably many elements) correct? But then why does Wikipedia state that ""There are uncountably many Vitali sets...""?","['measure-theory', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
231250,What kind of quadrilateral is determined by four sides and a diagonal?,"Wikipedia says that The shape of a simple quadrilateral is fully determined by the lengths of its sides and one diagonal. but I have my doubts. For example, the two quadrilaterals in this picture both have the same side lengths and the same yellow diagonal, but are not the same. Am I missing something here, or are simple quadrilaterals not actually determined (all sides and angles) by the lengths of four sides and a diagonal? If not, what about a convex quadrilateral? Would that be fully determined by those lengths?",['geometry']

231316,Sheaves created by global sections and their cohomology,"I've got a question concerning sheaves created by global sections.

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf. Then $H^i(X,F(n))=0$ for $i\ge 1$ and sufficiently large $n$. There is another theorem by Serre saying that: If $X$ is a projective scheme over a noetherian ring $A$, let $\mathcal{O}_X (1)$ denote a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$. Then there is a $d_0$ for each coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ so that $F(d)$ is generated by
its global sections, whenever $d ≥ d_0$ . Are these theorems related in the way that one of them follows from the other one? Especially: Is it true that for every sheaf created by global sections  the higher cohomology vanishes? Thanks Betti","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
231317,Carmichael number factoring,"The task I'm faced with is to implement a poly-time algorithm that finds a nontrivial factor of a Carmichael number. Many resources on the web state that this is easy, however without further explanation why. Furthermore, since Miller-Rabin exits when a nontrivial square root of 1 is found, this can be used to find a factor to the Carmichael number: $x^2 \equiv 1 = (x+1)(x-1)\equiv0 \pmod N$, where N is the Carmichael number we want to factor and $x$ the nontrivial square root of 1. Hence factors must be found using $\gcd(x+1,N)$ and $\gcd(x-1, N)$, correct? Due to problems with strong liars, in some cases we will miss out on factors. Is this a major problem? Since Miller-Rabin tests only passes composites with a probability 1/4, is it correct to say that the chances of finding a factor is > 0.5?

231321,Finding the area of an ellipse using Divergence Theorem,"As an example of Divergence Theorem, our textbook mentions finding area of an ellipse, but it isn't clear how it was derived though. Following is an excerpt from the textbook. Suppose there is an ellipse with the following equation,
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$
Then we could parameterize it into
$$x=a\cos t, y=b\sin t \space (0\le t\le 2\pi)$$
In order to find the area enclosed by the ellipse, we use the equation $$area=\frac 12\int\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n \space ds$$
where $$\mathbf r(x,y)=x\mathbf i+y\mathbf j$$
$$\mathbf n=(b\cos t,a\sin t)/v(t)\space (v(t)=\sqrt{b^2\cos^2t+a^2\sin^2t})$$
Hence, the area of the ellipse is
$$\begin{align} 
area & = \frac 12\int\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n \space ds \\
& = \frac 12 \int_0^{2\pi} (a\cos t, b\sin t)\cdot(b\cos t, a\sin t)dt \\
& = ab\pi

Since ${\rm Aut}(C_{42})=C_{12}$ I've reduced this to finding homomorphisms $\theta:C_{3}\rightarrow C_{12})$. Now, here is where I'm struggling to understand the material.

So if I'm getting this right, I need to find a $\mu:b\rightarrow b^k$ such that $\mu^3:b\rightarrow b^{k^3}=b$, so that the automorphism $\mu$ has order 3.

If $\alpha$ is a nonzero element of $L$ then $x \mapsto Tr(\alpha x)$ is an element of the dual space of $L$ (as a $K$-vector space) and it is a homomorphism from $L$ to the dual space. Since kernel is trivial it follows that $L$ is isomorphic to it's dual under the bilinear form $(x,y) \mapsto Tr(xy)$. I don't understand this part, trivial kernel only gives injectivity.

231627,Effect of angle and lever length on torque,"First, some background on my problem: I'm a sailor, and I'm looking to attach a rope between the base of my boat's mast and the boom. We refer to this rope as a boom vang, and its purpose is to pull the boom down. Because the boom may swing from side to side, the rope is led to one end to the mast itself, in line with where the boom attached, and from there goes to the sailor. The question is, where on the boom should the other end of the boom vang be attached to maximize the downward torque? Here is a diagram (it's terrible - sorry), with the boom vang in solid blue: H is fixed. From the base of the mast, the rope leads off to the sailor, who can apply tension to it, some of which will become a downward force. The other variable is the distance from the mast to where the vang attaches to the boom, L. Theta is the angle between the rope and the deck (or the boom). It seems to me that the torque is the product of the downward force and the length of the lever that it's working on, L. Now, as L is increased, theta is decreased, reducing the downward force (compressing the boom instead). In the extreme cases, where theta is 90 degrees (parallel to the mast, thus maximum downward force, but no lever to act on), or infinitesimal (parallel to the infinitely long boom, providing a great long lever to act on but all of the force in the horizontal) there is no torque. So, how to choose the correct angle? If I remember correctly, the vertical component of the force should be sine(theta). Further, L should be cosine(theta). Since the torque is their product, the value for any theta should be sin(theta)*cos(theta). Is that correct? If so, the maximum should be theta = pi/4 radians, correct?

A prevariety is a quasicompact topological space with a sheaf of $k$-valued functions (for $k$ some algebraically closed field) such that every point is contained in an open set such that the restriction of the sheaf to that set makes it isomorphic (as a ringed space) to an affine variety.

Given two numbers, there are countless ways to compare them (subtraction, division, logarithms, etc), but I want to know which comparisons make the most sense in the context of probability.

Prove that there is a compact set $K\subset X$ (the carrier or support of $\mu$) such that $\mu(K)=1$ but $\mu(H)<1$ for every proper compact subset $H$ of $K$. I could not follow Rudin's hint that If $K$ is the intersection of all compact set $K_{\alpha}$ with $K_{\alpha}=1$, then every open set in $V$ contains $K$ also contains some $K_{\alpha}$. I do not know how to prove this. In the simple scenario where $X$ has only finite (or countably) many such $K_{a}$'s, $\mu(K)=1$ is apparent by De Morgan's law. However I do not know what will be wrong if there is an open set $O$ containing $K$ but not any of the $K_{i}$, since $O-K_{i}$ could have zero measure. I also do not know how to prove in the uncountable case that $\mu(K)=1$ where De Morgan's law gives uncountable union and $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} \mu(O_{\alpha})$ except following Rudin's suggestion. So I am stuck. Also, even if I managed to show this property, what should I do with regularity to prove $\mu(H)<1$ for every proper compact set $H$ of $K$? Again $H$ can be differed by $K$ with a compact set of measure 0. I tried to reduce the proof by checking the case of $K,K_{1},K_{2}$, where $\mu(K)=\mu(K_{1})=\mu(K_{2})=\mu(K_{1}\bigcup K_{2})=1$.

231948,Is War necessarily finite?,"War is an cardgame played by children and drunk college students which involves no strategic choices on either side.  The outcome is determined by the dealing of the cards.  These are the rules. A standard $52$ card deck is shuffled and dealt evenly to two players face down.  Every turn, both players lay down their top cards (a ""battle"").  The higher card wins, and the winning player gets both cards and places them at the bottom of his deck.  If the battle is a tie, a ""war"" is declared, and each player lays down his next three cards.  Of these six cards, the owner of the card with the highest value wins the turn, and all cards played that turn are placed at the bottom of his deck.  If a player does not have $3$ cards to play in a war, he wins the turn by default.  If the war is a tie, another war is held (""double war""), and so on until one of the players wins.  The game ends when a player runs out of cards. If the case occurs that the deals are entirely symmetric, e.g. both players decks are two two's, two threes, two fours, etc. in that order, we say that both players lose, as does everyone watching.  (In other words, the game ""fails."")  This would be considered a finite game. Ordering Conventions. To consider the game from a mathematical standpoint, the order that cards are placed into a player's hand after he wins a turn must be well-defined.  There are many choices to be made here, especially considering that we can vary the conventions for double wars, triple wars, etc., which is where the most potential for variation lies.  For the sake of simplicity, and because it coincides with how I pick the cards up when I am actually playing, I suggest that when a player wins a turn, he picks up all of the losing cards in the order that they were laid down (highest to lowest), followed all of the winning cards. For example, say a turn begins with a battle in which players $\sf X$ and $\sf Y$ both lay down aces.  Thus a war begins.  Say that player $\sf X$ lays down a Jack, a King, and a $3$ , in that order, and player $\sf Y$ lays down a Queen, a $4$ , and a King, in that order.  So a double war is held.  Player $\sf X$ lays down $5$ , $6$ , $7$ and player $\sf Y$ lays down $8$ , $9$ , $10$ .  Now, player $\sf Y$ wins, so all of these cards are placed in his deck, ordered as such: $$\sf (\ldots\text{previous deck}\ldots, \underbrace{\overbrace{\text{A},}^{\text{battle}}\overbrace{\text{J},\text{K},3,}^{\text{first war}}\overbrace{5,6,7,}^{\text{second war}}}_{\text{losing cards}}\underbrace{\overbrace{\text{A},}^{\text{battle}}\overbrace{\text{Q},4,\text{K},}^{\text{first war}}\overbrace{8,9,10}^{\text{second war}}}_{\text{winning cards}}).$$ A possible variation would be to pick up the cards in each war separately, in the order the wars were played, in which case the above example would yield $$\sf (\ldots\text{previous deck}\ldots,\overbrace{\underbrace{A,}_{\text{losing}}\underbrace{A,}_{\text{winning}}}^{battle}\overbrace{\underbrace{J,K,3,}_{\text{losing}}\underbrace{Q,4,K,}_{\text{winning}}}^{\text{first war}}\overbrace{\underbrace{5,6,7,}_{\text{losing}}\underbrace{8,9,10}_{\text{winning}}}^{\text{second war}}).$$ Questions. First and foremost, Is War necessarily finite? Perhaps there exists some arrangement of starting decks which would produce an everlasting game, forever permuting cards between the two players.  If this is not possible, can we prove it?  Which ordering conventions always give rise to finite games (if any exist)? and, for bonus points, There are $\rm {52 \choose 26}(26!)^2\approx 10^{41}$ possible ways to deal the decks at the beginning of the game.  Since suits are irrelevant, however, some arrangements will result in identical games. What is the expression for the number non-identical games? Thanks joriki. A (substantially) tougher question: if we say that two games are similar if every turn has the same outcome, what is the expression for the number of non-similar games?","['permutations', 'game-theory', 'algorithms', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

We know that $n_2 \mid 7$ and $n_2 \equiv 1 \pmod 2$ and we know that $n_7 \mid 2^5$ and $n_7 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$. So we can say $n_2 = 1$ or $7$ and $n_7 = 1$ or $8$. Suppose, to the contrary that $G$ is a simple group. Then $n_7 = 8$ and $n_2 = 7$. So we can say there are $8 \cdot 6 = 48$ elements of order 7 and $7 \cdot 31 = 217$ elements of order 2, which gives us 265 elements, 266 including the identity, which contradicts the cardinality of the group. Hence, $G$ is not a simple group since we must have at least one of $n_7$ or $n_2$ being 1. Is this approach correct? specifically how i said there were $7 \cdot 31$ elements of order 2?

Specifically, we get provided with a sample mean and the sample size, lets call them avg_pos and impressions . If you can't tell yet, the domain is advertising, avg_pos tells us the average position our ad showed in over the period of a day, and impressions tells us how many impressions we got (the size of the sample used for avg_pos ). Now, suppose I want to get the average position for a 30 day period — we only have available to us 30 avg_pos values and 30 impressions values. The sum of impressions is the amount of impressions over the entire period. Question: intuitively I think one way to estimate the 30 day average position would be to do something like: $$
total\_impressions = \sum impressions
\\
\sum avg\_pos * \frac{impressions}{total\_impressions}
$$ Can someone explain the implications of this approach, and when it is likely to be accurate and when it is not? I assume its accuracy will depend on how normally distributed all the position values are that make up the avg_pos sample means.","['statistics', 'estimation', 'average']"

It is easy to show that 2) implies 1). However, I am unable to show the converse. I could show that $f$ is extreme implies $\|f\|=1$ but this is far from what we need. My guess: if 2) is false. We try to construct a nonnegative function $r$ on $X$ which is strictly positive when $|f(x)|\neq 1$ and meanwhile \begin{equation}
|(1+r)f|\le 1

f=\frac{1}{2}(1+r)f+\frac{1}{2}(1-r)f.

If $|f|$ is bounded away from $0$, then $r=-1+1/|f|$ would be a good choice, but I cannot rule out the case when $f$ vanishes at certain points. Can somebody help? Thanks!
