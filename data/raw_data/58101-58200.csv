There is clasical theorem that states that if all eigenvalues of ${\rm Df}(0)$ have nonzero real part, than $x'=f(x)$ and $x'={\rm Df}(0) x$ are topological equivalent at neighbourhood of $0$. Is there any generalization of this theorem? Like take truncuated(to $n$-th term) taylor expansion of $f(x)$ denote it $T_n(x)$. Than under what condition is $x'=f(x)$ topologicaly equivalent to $x'=T_n(x)$ at neighbourhood of $0$? We know the condition for $n=0,1$. For $n=0$ has to be $f(0)\neq 0$. For $n=1$ has to ${\rm Df}(0)$ have eigenvalues with nonzero real part and $f(0)=0$ If conditions for $n=0,1$ fail is there any know condition for $n=2$ ?

638064,"Order topology on the set $X = \{ 1,2 \} \times \mathbb{Z}_{+}$","I am learning topology with the book ""Topology"" by James R. Munkres and have some difficulty in understanding the Example 4 of section 14 titled ""The Order Topology"" (page 85 of the second edition). Example 4: The set $X = \{ 1,2 \} \times \mathbb{Z}_{+}$ in the dictionary order is another example of an ordered set with a smallest element. Denoting $1 \times n$ by $a_n$ and $2 \times n$ by $b_n$, we can represent $X$ by $$a_1, a_2, \ldots; b_1, b_2, \ldots.$$ The order topology on $X$ is not the discrete topology. Most one-point sets are open, but there is an exception --- the one-point set $\{ b_1 \}$. Any open set containing $b_1$ must contain a basis element about $b_1$ (by definition), and any basis element containing $b_1$ contains points of the $a_i$ sequence. I am confused about the last statement: any basis element containing $b_1$ contains points of the $a_i$ sequence . What is the reason? And why is $\{ b_2 \}$ (or $\{ b_3 \}, \ldots$) open? What is key distinction between $b_1$ and $b_2$?",['general-topology']
638070,How many paths would confirm the existence of limit of a two variable function?,"My question is : Suppose we know that $\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}f(x,y)$ exists in infinitely many paths for a function $f : \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ then can we say that limit exists and it can be obtained from choosing any path. May be i should have been more careful when saying so... Actual question is to evaluate $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{x^3y}{x^4+y^2}$ First thing one would do is to check for ""Non existence"" by which i mean trying out some paths hoping that limit in those two paths would differ and then conclude that limit does not exist. But then what if the limit in more than one path coincide.. In this situation i would take $y=mx$ then : $$\dfrac{x^3y}{x^4+y^2}=\dfrac{mx^4}{x^4+m^2x^2}\rightarrow 0 \text { as x $\rightarrow$ 0}$$ We realize that irrespective of $m$ we would end up with $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \dfrac{x^3y}{x^4+y^2}=0$ along the path $y=mx$. I am sure with this we can not say that limit exists... so, how many paths (I have checked uncountably many as my $m\in \mathbb{R}$) should i check to confirm the existence. There might be some other ways to calculate the limit by some squeeze principle or some but then Is there any thing that if you verify that limit coincide in this many paths then you can conclude limit exist. P.S : My question is not about evaluating the limit but actually Existence of limit knowing its value in some paths... so please do not answer with keeping in mind  the word ""Evaluate"" Thank you :)","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

Here is my question. Question : Is the following proposition true? Proposition : Let $n\ge2\in\mathbb Z.$ For any $k\in\mathbb N$ such that $k\lt n^2$ and $k$ is coprime to $n$ , if we consider $$[1,2,3,\cdots, (n-3),(n-2),n]_{n+1}\times k$$ as a number with $n$ -digits in base $n+1$ , then it has every number from $0$ to $n$ except one number as its digit numbers, where $$[1,2,3,\cdots, (n-3),(n-2),n]_{n+1}$$ represents $123\cdots(n-3)(n-2)n$ in base $n+1$ . Example : The examples at the top are the $n=9$ cases of the proposition. Remark : Suppose that the $n$ -th digit number of a number with $n-1$ digits is $0$ . For example, suppose that we treat $$12345679\times 2=24691358$$ as $$12345679\times 2=[0]24691358.$$ Motivation : I've known the followings : $$12345679\times 9=111111111$$ $$12345679\times 18=222222222$$ $$\vdots$$ $$12345679\times 72=888888888$$ $$12345679\times 81=999999999$$ Then, I found that the property at the top has already been known. Though I've tried to prove that the proposition is true, I'm facing difficulty. Can anyone prove or disprove it? P.S. $1$ : Before I posted this question at math overflow , but it was considered as off-topic. However, I got helpful comments from S. Carnahan there. ""Isn't this just a manifestation of the base $n+1$ expansion of $1/n^2$ ?"" ""We may assume $k\lt n$ , since the addition of $j/n$ just adds copies of $j$ , preserving the pattern. The progression from one digit to the next in the expansion is addition by $k$ iff the next digit has no carry, and $k+1$ iff the next digit has a carry. The symbol $n−k$ is necessarily skipped, and there is no premature periodicity (since the multiplicative order of $n+1$ mod $n^2$ is unchanged). "" I think these comments must be true, but these are not obvious for me. P.S. $2$ : I'm going to write the proof for the $k\lt n$ cases to get more hints from you. This is because I'm facing difficulty for proving the following though I think the proof for the $k\lt n$ cases would be fine. What I cannot prove is : If the proposition is true for $k\lt n$ , then it is true for $n\lt k\lt n^2.$ (Though this may be obvious, I cannot get a rigorous proof for it...please let me know it.) In the following, I'm going to write the proof for the $k\lt n$ cases . Proof : First, we use the following fact (of course, the proof is needed, but it is easy to prove it.) Fact : $[1,2,3,\cdots,(n-3),(n-1),n]\times n=[1,1,1,\cdots, 1,1,1]$ (with $n$ $1$ s) Using this fact, we can see $$\begin{align}[1,2,3,\cdots, (n-3),(n-2),n]\times k&=[1,1,1,\cdots,1,1,1]\div n\times k\\&=[1,1,1,\cdots,1,1,1]\times k\div n\\&=[k,k,k,\cdots,k,k,k]\div n.\end{align}$$ In the following, let us consider in mod $n$ . We can see that the remainders in the process of calculating $$[k,k,k,\cdots,k,k,k]\div n$$ are $$k,2k,3k,\cdots,(n-1)k,nk(\equiv 0).$$ Since $k$ is coprime to $n$ , we can easily see that there is no $i\not=j\ (1\le i,j\le n-1)$ such that $$ik\equiv jk.$$ This immediately leads that the answer for $$[k,k,k,\cdots,k,k,k]\div n$$ has distinct numbers as its digit numbers. Q.E.D. P.S. $3$ : Now I have a question. Can I say the following at the last step of my proof above?
I thought it was obvious, but now I feel this does not seem obvious... ""This immediately leads that the answer for $$[k,k,k,\cdots,k,k,k]\div n$$ has distinct numbers as its digit numbers.""","['recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"

638334,"How should I think about reflexive spaces? What ""property"" do I get from a space being reflexive?","Let $(X,\| \cdot \|_X)$ be a $\mathbb{R}$-vector space with bidual space $X^{**}$. We defined $X$ to be reflexive, if the canonical embedding $\mathcal I: X \to X^{**}$ with $$\mathcal I x(l) := l(x)$$ for all $l \in X^*, x \in X$ is surjective.

I have seen theorems requiring reflexivity in the proof, however I don't understand why there is no proof if the canonical embedding is not surjective (of course I can't find any such proof either). For example, we have seen the following ""approximation theorem"": Let $X$ be reflexive, $M \subset X$ non-empty, convex and closed, $x_0 \in X \setminus M$.

Any idea is appreciated. Update: I think I have a answer, please verify if it is correct. Assume ad absurdum that there is $y\in \partial\Omega$, $y$ is not isolated in $\partial\Omega$, such that in the set $V_r=\overline{B(y,r)\cap \partial\Omega}$ (for some $r>0$) there is no point which satisfies IBC.

As $d(z,\partial\Omega)<d(z,V_r)$, the infimum of $d(z,\partial\Omega)$ is achieved in $\partial\Omega\setminus V_r$ in some point $w_{\delta}$. By choosing $\delta$ sufficiently small, we must have that $\|z-y\|=d(z,y)<d(z,w_{\delta})$, because $w_{\delta}$ is outside the ball $B(x,r)$.

638575,how to show that integral depending on a parameter are continuously differentiable,"I'm trying to solve this exercise Let $f:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R} \space$ an integrable function, show: $$g(z):=\int_{0}^1\frac{f(x)}{x-z}dx$$ is a continuous differentiable function on $\mathbb R \backslash[0,1]$. This is what I've done: we have seen two theorems in class. One allows me to see whether an integral is differentiable and calculate its derivative, while the other one allows me to see whether the integral is continuous (If you need them I can post them). Therefore I've decided to check first whether the integral was differentiable and after that whether the derivative of the integral was continuous. To check whether the integral is differentiable I've to check 1) the function inside the integral is in $L^1$, 2) that she is differentiable with derivative $\frac {\delta f(x,z)}{\delta z}$, where $f(x,z):=\frac{f(x)}{x-z}$. 3) I have to check whether the derivative has a dominating function. Here are my calculation: 1) I was unsure about this point. I've considered the fact that $z \in (-\infty,\epsilon) \cup (1+\epsilon, +\infty)$ where $\epsilon \gt0$ and that $x \in [0,1]$ to point out that the denominator must be bounded by some constant $C\gt0$ (is this true? Can I do it?). If I do like this I get that the denominator is never 0 and this implies that the function $\frac{f(x)}{x-z}$ is integrable. 2)I've calculated the derivative (since the derivative exist by the previous point at every point z) $$\frac {\delta f(x,z)}{\delta z}= \frac {\delta}{\delta z} \frac{f(x)}{x-z}=\frac {f(x)}{(x-z)^2}$$ 3) by doing the same reasoning as in 1) I've thought that the denominator can't vanish and hence there exist a dominating function which is in $L^1$ The derivative of g(z) will be $$g(z)'= \int_{0}^1 \frac {f(x)}{(x-z)^2}dx$$ Now what I've done is to check that this function is continuous on $\mathbb {R}\backslash [0,1]$ (I have to check 1') the function inside the integrale is measurable, 2') she is continuous for x fixed and 3') there exist a dominating function of the function inside the integrale) 1) the function $\frac {f(x)}{(x-z)^2}$is measurable since $f(x)$ measurable and $(x-z)^2$ measurable (since is never 0 and never $\infty$, hence is a number, hence is continuous) 2) the function is continuous since composition of continuous functions (same argument as above) 3) same argument as above with dominating function h defined as: $$h(x) =\begin{cases}
f(x) & \text{if } (x-z)\le 1 \\
   (\frac {1}{C}+\epsilon)      & \text{if } (x-z)\lt 1

638780,Is this periodic solution unique? (ODE),"So, for the ODE
\begin{align}
x' = -x^{3} + \sin t,

we can show that there exists a $2\pi$ periodic solution.  To do this, we denote by
\begin{align}
x(t,\alpha)
\end{align}
The solution $x(t)$ of the ODE such that $x(0) = \alpha$.  Then, let $\alpha \in [-2,2]$.  Consider the function $f(\alpha) = x(2\pi, \alpha)$
\begin{align}
x > 1 &\Rightarrow x' < 0 \\
x < 1 &\Rightarrow x' > 0.
\end{align} Thus, solutions beginning in $[-2,2]$ stay there and we can use Brouwer's fixed point theorem to show that there exists a fixed point of $f$.  Therefore there is some $\alpha^{*}$ such that $f(\alpha^{*}) = \alpha^{*}$, which represents the periodic solution $x(t,\alpha)$. Now, my question: Is this $2\pi$- periodic solution unique? Are there other $2\pi$ periodic solutions of this ODE?

It's about the trivialisation of the Moebius strip as a bundle on $S^1$ with fibre an open interval $I\subset \mathbb{R}$. First of all, I write the strip as $E=[0,1]^2/\sim$, where $(0,y)\sim(1,1-y)$ and the other points of $[0,1]^2$ are equivalent to themselves.
Then I write $S^1=[0,1]/\sim$, where $0\sim 1$.
Now I define the projection $\pi: E\rightarrow S^1$, $\pi([(x,y)])=[x]$ (here with $[\cdot]$ I mean the equivalence class of $\cdot$). Now I want to find an open cover  $U_1,U_2$ of $S^1$ (two arcs of $S^1$ substantially) such that there exist homeomorphisms $\phi_i:\pi^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow U_i\times I$, $i=1,2$ and this homeomorphisms have the property that $\pi_1\circ \phi_i=\pi$, where $\pi_1$ is the canonical projection onto the first factor. Now, my problem is write properly the homeomorphisms. Suppose that $S^1\ni[0]\notin U_1$, so $[0]\in U_2$. Then $\pi^{-1}(U_1)$ is exactly $U_1\times I$ and as homeomorphism I can choose the identity. But now my problem is $\pi^{-1}(U_2)$ which contains the gluing edges.
Can anyone help me, please? For example if $S^1\supset U_2=([0,2/5)\cup(3/5,1])/\sim$, then I could define $\phi_2([(x,y)])=(x,y)$ if $0\le x<2/5$ and $\phi_2([(x,y)])=(x,1-y)$ if $3/5<x<1$.

and I have proven this algebraically see below. However I want to look at the problem
from a geometrical perspective. As long as $k$ and $n$ are coprime, eg $\gcd(n,k)=1$
then the powers of $\omega^k$ seem to simply permutate $\omega$. n=3 n=5 Can this property of the roots of units be explained geometrically, or by some combinatorial proof? My question is Can equation $(1)$ be explained purely from a geometrical or combinatorial point of view? Proof : 
  Assume that $1\leq k \leq n-1$ then
  \begin{align*}
	\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^k & = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} [\exp(2\pi i k/n)]^j
	                         = \frac{1 - [\exp(2\pi i k/n)]^n}{1 - \exp(2\pi i k/n) }
                                 = 0
\end{align*}
  Since the denominator equals zero, eg $\exp(2i\pi k)=1\ \forall k\in \mathbb{N}$.
  The case for $k=n$ must be treated seperately as it leads to a $0/0$ expression above. 
  \begin{align*}
	\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^n & = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \exp(2\pi i j)
	                         = n

 _| So at an infinitely close distance the derivative looks like the second graph above. But now if you look at the derivative at an infinitely close distance, it looks the the first graph.  So how can the derivative look two different ways at an infinitely close distance?

639547,Choice of branches for contour integration.,"Suppose I have the following function of a complex variable $$f(z)=\log(z)(z^2+1)^{1/2}.$$ Wolfram Alpha tells me the branch cuts of $f(z)$ are $z\leq 0$ (presumably for the logarithmic term), and $\text{Re}(z)=0$,$|z|\geq 1$ (presumably for the square root), i.e. they are restricted to subsets of either the real or imaginary axes. If I want to use the residue calculus with $f(z)$, my contour had better avoid (i.e. not cross) these branch cuts. I think I'm right in saying that I can choose my branches to suite my needs. Hence, if it turns out that the Wolfram choice of branch cuts permits an awkward contour, can I make a different choice of branch (by way of defining my branch cuts differently) to make life easier? For example, instead of the above choice, could I choose my branch cuts to be $z\geq 0$ for the logarithm, and $z\leq -1$ and $z\geq 1$ for the square root? This choice leaves the entire upper and lower half planes ""free of problems"", whereas the initial choice defines branches along both positive and imaginary axes.","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

639615,"A naive question about ""random"" probability distributions","So I've come up with this idea, which may be mathematically unprecise, but it goes as follows. Example: Suppose you have a random variable $X$ taking values in the interval $[-1,1]$. Then, say, instead of a definite probability density $f(x)$ we have two different distributions $g$ and $h$ of the variable $X$. The probability that $X=x$ is the result of choosing either $g$ or $h$ by a toss of a coin and then taking the value of the corresponding density at the point $x$. The function $$F(x)=\frac{1}{2} (g(x)+h(x))$$ seems to be resulting probability density function of $X$. Analogously, one can have a finite number $n$ of density functions, then assign $n$ different probabilities, one for each of then, and the result will be the probability density function of the combined different probabilities. Now the question. Take the space $S$ of every continuous function from the interval $I=[-1,1]$ to the positive real axis, such that the integral of every function in this space $S$ in the interval $I$ equals one. Now define a random variable $X$, the value of which is taken in the following manner. First you pick a function $f$, belonging to $S$, completely at random, i. e., the probability of taking $f$ is the same as taking any other function. Then, in this case, the probability density of $X=x$ is just $f(x)$. The problem: is there a ""resulting probability distribution"" as given in the first example, of the above process (taking at random a function and then taking the value of this function at a point $x$)? One can see such resulting function as the ""expected"" or ""mean"" function in the space $S$, with respect to a uniform probability distribution. Again, I don't know if this heuristic construction is precise mathematically, neither, if it is, if this possess an interesting answer. I suspect the most reasonable answer should be the uniform density $F(x)=\frac{1}{2}$. I appreciate any comments in this question!","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'analysis']"
