However, I'm not sure how to prove it the other way around by using limits. To prove that $f'$ being odd implies that $f$ is even, I tried $f'(a) = -f'(-a).$ So, $$f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = -\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(-a+h) - f(-a)}{h} = -f'(-a) $$ Is this correct, and if so, where do I go from here?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

Motivation :Inspired by Samuel Reid's question , I am trying to find a generalization of $n$-person zero sum sequential game of perfect information. A natural way to generalize the payoff set is to replace it by a partition of the set of all outcomes with exactly $n$ atoms. Each person has a complete strict order on those $n$ atoms. To avoid difficulty  in Feanor's answer, one way is to require that, for each atom of outcomes, there isn't a pair of players that assigns the same ranking to it. In the cases $n = 2,3$, there is only one kind of players' preference up to isomorphism. But What can we say in general.","['matrices', 'permutations', 'abstract-algebra']"

357243,Need to prove $f$ continuous at $x_0$ iff for every monotonic sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $x_0$ we have $\lim f(x_n)=f(x_0)$,"This was a problem that the Professor went over in class, but I am having trouble understanding and finishing the proof. The full question is: $f:I \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is continuous at $x_0 \in I$ if and only if for any monotonic sequence $x_n$, with $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x_0)$ This is his solution (I'll mention where I am confused): We know that for every monotonic sequence
  $$(x_n) \rightarrow x_0, f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x_0)$$
  Want to show that 
  $$x_n \rightarrow x_0 \implies f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x_0) $$

  With $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ we know there exists a monotonic convergent subsequence,
  $$x_{n_k} \rightarrow x_0 .$$ Now we want to show $\{f(x_n)\}_n$ is Cauchy. (Where did this come from? Why does this need to be shown? From what I understand, $\{f(x_n)\}_n$ is a subsequence  of the function $f$? Or would this technically be called a subfunction? I don't know if there is such a thing) For any $\epsilon > 0, \exists N_{\epsilon}$ such that 
  $$|f(x_m)-f(x_n)|<\epsilon \quad for \quad m,n>N_{\epsilon} $$
  If not, $\exists \epsilon_0, \forall N\in \mathbb R$ such that 
  $$|f(x_m)-f(x_n)|\geq \epsilon \quad for \quad some \quad m,n>N$$ I am supposed to finish the proof by showing that $\{f(x_n)\}_n$ is Cauchy, but I am not sure how to do this and don't know where to begin. Sorry if the question involves a lot of explaining, it isn't a homework problem to be turned in but I need to understand what is going on (if I can show it is Cauchy, however, I do get a bit of extra credit, so please don't give me the answer off the bat).

357444,Algorithm to calculate multiple integral.,"One of the major difficulties of student in advanced calculus  (including myself when student) is to obtain the extremes of repeated integrals to calculate the volume integral in $R^n$ i.e. transform  the integral 
$$
\int_{D}f(x) \,\mathrm d\,V_n, \quad  f\in C(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$
in the multiple integral 
$$
\int_{c_1^1}^{d_1^1}\cdots\int_{c_n^1}^{d_n^1} f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \,\mathrm d\,x_1\ldots \,\mathrm d\,x_n
+\ldots +

The integer $m$ arises from the need to partition the set $D$. More precisely I would get for a well-defined algorithm (that could be manually computable) whose output was the number $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and the extremes of integration in terms of vectors $a\in\mathbb{R}^p$, $b\in\mathbb{R}^p$ ​​and the matrices $M^1,\ldots,M^p\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ that define the set $D\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ as below

357452,An analytic function is onto,"All sets are subsets of $\mathbb{C}$. Suppose $f: U \to D$ is analytic where $U$ is bounded and open, and $D$ is the open unit disk. Now suppose we can continuously extend $f$ to $\bar{f}: \bar{U} \to \bar D$, such that $\bar{f}(\partial U) \subseteq \partial D$.  To show that $f$ is onto, I was thinking maybe I could show that $f(U)$ is  a dense subset of $\bar{D}$ , and since $\bar{f}(U) = f(U)$ is open by the open mapping theorem, it must be $D$.  But to do this I would need to know that $f(\partial U) = \partial D$.  Is this true? Some advice or other approaches would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","['continuity', 'complex-analysis']"

357561,Passing from integration over hermitian matrices to integration over eigenvalues.,"Integral over hermitian matrices $\int dH$ in terms of matrix $H$ components $h_{ij}$ is defined by $$\int dH f(H)=\int \prod_idh_{ii}\prod_{i<j}d^2h_{ij} f(H)$$ Integrals over diagonal components are one-dimensional since these components are obligatory real for hermitian matrix and integrals over independent non-diagonal elements are two-dimensional. Any hermitian matrix $H$ can be diagonalized by means of some unitary matrix $U$ such that $H=UDU^\dagger$ with $D=diag\{d_1,...\}$ and $d_1,...$ being eigenvalues of $H$.

357750,Proof Strategy for a Dynamical System of Points on the Plane,"I have a rather simple-looking system which exhibits a particular behaviour in simulation, and I would now like to attempt to prove this formally. The problem is, I don't really know where to start, and would very much appreciate some suggestions on different ways that I could try out. System Description I will try to describe the system as concisely as I can (but I'm happy to add details as comments on request). There are $n$ points on a plane, which are initially randomly distributed. Each point has a position, $(x,y)$, and an orientation, $\theta$, and projects a line of sight (LOS) along this orientation. Every point moves in one of two ways, depending on whether its LOS intersects at least one circle of radius $r$ centered around another point ($r$ being a fixed parameter). If there is an intersection, the point turns clockwise on the spot (i.e. $\dot{\theta}=\omega$, $\omega$ being a fixed parameter). Otherwise, it moves backwards (i.e. with the LOS pointing opposite the direction of motion) along a circular trajectory of radius $R$ ($R$ being a fixed parameter). Emergent Behaviour For the right values of $R$ and $\omega$ (which I have found through simulation), the points will aggregate into one 'cluster' (one can define a metric, e.g., by saying that every point is at a distance of at most $d$ from at least one other point). I want to prove that this aggregation happens from any given set of initial positions and orientations. What I Have Tried So Far Two approaches come to my mind. One can either attack the problem using geometry, or represent it in state space and try to analyse the resultant system of ODEs. Using geometry, I have made the assumption that only one point moves at a time (this would not be a complete proof, but is acceptable for me). I have rather easily proven that one moving point will approach one static point, but I have no idea how to generalize this. A dynamical systems approach seems hard because of the severe non-linearities in the input function. The $n$-body gravitational problem is unsolvable, and to my mind, its dynamics seem simpler than this!","['dynamical-systems', 'geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'proof-writing']"

I know that we can construct a homeomorphism from the extended complex plane $\mathbb{C} \cup \infty$ to the sphere $S^2$ by stereographic projection, and further that the sphere is compact. So, if a meromorphic function has infinitely many disjoint poles (i.e at the integers), perhaps we can construct a cover without a finite subcover. I am however getting confused as to the details, in particular where $\infty$ comes in. Many thanks for you help.",['complex-analysis']

358330,Infinite distributive law,"This is related to an previous post of mine and is from a result in my book. I have the following equality: $$p(x)=\sum_{k_i\ge 0}\left(\frac{x^{\sum_{i=1}^\infty ik_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^\infty k_i!(i!)^{k_i}}\right)$$ where the summation runs over all sequences $k_1,k_2\cdots$ of non-negative integers containing finitely many non-zero entries. The next sentence in the book is Consequently $p(x)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty \left(\sum_{k_i=0}^\infty \frac{x^{ik_i}}{k_i!(i!)^{k_i}}\right)$. Its not clear to me how this sentence follows from the previous expression for $p(x)$. My attempt: If $(a_1,a_2\cdots),(b_1,b_2,\cdots)$ are natural sequences with finitely many non zero terms then the first expression for $p(x)$ contains terms like $+\cdots\left(\frac{x^{a_1}}{a_1!1!^{a_1}}.\frac{x^{2a_2}}{a_2!2!^{a_2}}.\frac{x^{3a_3}}{a_3!3!^{a_3}}\cdots\right)\cdots+\left(\frac{x^{b_1}}{b_1!1!^{b_1}}.\frac{x^{2b_2}}{b_2!2!^{b_2}}.\frac{x^{3b_3}}{b_3!3!^{b_3}}\cdots\right)+\cdots$.

358404,Gelfand-Leray integral for forms with noncompact support,"Let $\omega$ be a smooth $n$-form with compact support on domain $\Omega \subseteq{\mathbb{R}^n}$ and let $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function with nonvanishing differential. Then for any point $x \in \Omega$ there exists a neighborhood $U_\alpha$ in which we can take $f(x)$ as one of local coordinates and so there exists a smooth form $\psi_\alpha$ defined in this neighborhood with property $df \wedge \psi_\alpha = \omega$. Restriction of $\psi_\alpha$ on any level set $f(x)=t$ is unique. Let $U_{\alpha}$ be a finite cover of support of $\omega$ with such neighborhoods and $\chi_\alpha$ be the associated partition of unity. The form
$$
   \frac{\omega}{d f} = \sum_\alpha \chi_\alpha \psi_\alpha 
$$
is then the unique smooth form on each level set such that $df \wedge \frac{\omega}{df} = \omega$. This form is called Gelfand-Leray form and its integral
$$
    J(t) = \int\limits_{f(x)=t} \frac{\omega}{df}

is called Gelfand-Leray function. It has the property that
$$

Thus I will go in different way in another question. I focused on zeros in a new question.

358488,A symmetric matrix whose square is zero,"I was once asked in an oral exam whether there can be a symmetric non zero matrix whose square is zero. After some thought I replied that there couldn't be because the minimal polynomial of such a matrix is guaranteed to be $x^2$ which shows that it isn't diagonalizable. I had to further clarify that a matrix is diagonalizable iff its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, and that every symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. While all this is correct, the examiner mentioned that there is a simpler argument possible but he didn't elaborate on it. I have since been wondering what that simpler argument could be. Can someone give a simpler proof? Thanks","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
358514,Distribution of palindromic numbers,"We all know what a palindromic number is, it is a number which is the same, independent from which side we read it, for example $101, 202, 33733, \dots$ It is also clear that there are infinity many palindromic numbers. What I am interested in is the frequency of palindromic numbers in specific intervals. For exmaple: In the interval $[100,999]$ there exist 9 palindromic numbers.
In $[1000,9999]$ we have 90, in $[10000,99999]$ we have 252, in $[100000-999999]$ we have 333. I calculated them by hand, is it somehow possible to use mathematica for that? How does this look like for really high intervals, how does the numbers of palindormic change, what is the relation bewteen the interval and the numbers of palindromic numbers? What I also asked myself, taking a random palindromic number $a\in[1000,9999]$ for example, how can we reverse the reverse-and-add algorithm. I mean the following: Taking a random number, for exmaple $15$ . Then I reverse it and add it to the number itself: $15+51=66$ , then we get a palindromic. How can it be evaluated on how many ways the number $66$ can be reiceived? In this case it is obviously one, but how do we know how many different numbers lead for exmaple to the number $5556555$ ?","['palindrome', 'recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"
