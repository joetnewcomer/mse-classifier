It feels like $H(Ax)$ should be at least $n$ as that is the entropy of $x$ and $A$ is very likely to be non-singular. We also know $H(Ax) \leq n \log_2{n}$ as we can encode $Ax$ in $n \log_2{n}$ bits (the entries of $Ax$ are no larger than $n$).

1573750,Computing variance of compound Poisson process from the M.G.F.,"Let $X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Y_i$ and $N_t$ be a Poisson process with
  intensity $\lambda >0$. Suppose $Y_i$ are i.i.d. (independent of
  $N_t$) with normal distribution $N(m,\sigma^2)$. Compute $Var(X_t)$. The MGF of $X_t$ is: $\psi_{X_t}(u) = e^{\lambda t (\psi_Y(u) -1)}$ Then, $\dfrac{d}{du}\psi_{X_t}(u) = \lambda t \dfrac{d}{du}\psi_{Y}(u) e^{\lambda t (\psi_Y(u) -1)}$ And, $\dfrac{d^2}{du^2}\psi_{X_t}(u) = (\lambda t)^2 (\dfrac{d}{du}\psi_{Y}(u))^2 + \lambda t \dfrac{d^2}{du^2}\psi_{Y}(u) e^{\lambda t (\psi_Y(u) -1)}$ So, $E(X_t^2) = \dfrac{d^2}{du^2}\psi_{X_t}(u) |_{u=0} = (\lambda t)^2 m^2 + \lambda t \sigma ^2 $ $=>Var(X_t) = (\lambda t)^2 m^2 + \lambda t \sigma ^2  - (\lambda t m)^2 = \lambda t \sigma ^2 $ But on wikipedia they have: $\lambda t m^2 + \lambda t \sigma ^2 $ Why is my answer not identical to wikipedia?

In Rudin Theorem 4.22, we know that If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, and $E$ is a connected subset of $X$, then $f(E)$ is connected. In the proof, we started with consider $f(E) = A \cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are nonempty separated subsets. Then put $G = E \cap f^{-1}(A)$ and $H = E \cap f^{-1}(B)$. Then Rudin is claiming that $E = G \cup H$. I'm a little suspicious about this. What if $f$ is non-surjective, then $f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B)$  is only a proper subset of $E$? Is there a property of $f$ being continuous that forces $f$ to be 1-1?","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'connectedness']"

Are there any general conditions that can be imposed on $V$ and $\tau$ that will ensure this? Since completions are, of course, determined only up to isomorphism, the question is perhaps in too imprecise a form to provide a meaningful answer, but it's motivated by the difference between basic examples from functional analysis. Compare, for instance, the difference between (1) the space of polynomials on $[0,1]$ having completion $C[0,1]$ (a space of functions on $[0,1]$) under the uniform norm and (2) the vector space of integrable simple functions on $[0,1]$ having $L^p[0,1]$ as its completion with respect to $\|\cdot\|_p$.

\text{trace}(A_nA_{n-1}\cdots A_1) = \text{trace}(A_1A_{n}\cdots A_{2})

The above holds for any cyclic permutation (informally, taking an element off the end and appending it onto the other end), but not, in general, for arbitrary permutations of the matrix product. On the other hand, the determinant of a matrix product satisfies the following property $\text{det}(A_nA_{n-1}\cdots A_1) = \text{det}(A_n)\text{det}(A_{n-1})\cdots \text{det}(A_1)$. Thus,
\begin{align*}

1574462,All open subsets of the spectrum of a number field are principal,"Let $K$ be a number field, $\mathcal{O}_k$ its ring of integers, $\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ its class group and $h_K = \lvert \operatorname{Cl}(K)\rvert$ its class number. Let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K)$ and let $U\subseteq X$ be an open subset of $X$. Apparently ( ex.3.19 Liu ), using the fact that $h_K$ is finite it can be shown that $U$ is in fact a principal open subset of $X$ i.e. $U = D(\alpha) = \left\{[P]\in X: \alpha\notin P\right\}$ for some element $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_K$. I've run into a possibly trivial roadblock in my attempt at a proof and would like it if someone could fix it for me or tell me where I went wrong. I've written out my attempt in full here: Proof : Since $U$ is open we have $U = X\backslash V(I)$ for some ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a Dedekind domain we have $I = P_1\dots P_n$ for unique prime (hence maximal) ideals $P_i\in\mathcal{O}_K$. If $U=X$ then we can take $U = D(1)$. Therefore suppose $U\neq X$; we have $V(I) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n V(P_i)$. Since each $P_i$ is maximal, the point $x_i = [P_i]\in X$ is closed. Hence $U$ is the complement in $X$ of the finite set $\left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\}$. Now we want to find an element $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_K$ such $U = D(\alpha)$. This element $\alpha$, if it exists, has to be contained in each $P_i$ since if $\alpha\notin P_i$ for some $i$ then $x_i = [P_i]\in D(\alpha)$, but $U = D(\alpha) = X\backslash\left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\}$. Therefore we need an element $\alpha\in J:= \bigcap_{i=1}^n P_i$. Since $I\subseteq J$ it would be nice to pick an element of $I$ for this $\alpha$, but since $I$ may not be principal there is no natural choice. Instead, note that since the class number $h_K$ is finite there exists an integer $m\leq h_K$ such that $I^m$ is a principal ideal, say $I^m = (\alpha)$. Now $I^m \subseteq I\subseteq J$ and therefore $D(\alpha)\subseteq U$. Now take a point $x = [Q]\in U$ for some prime ideal $Q\subseteq\mathcal{O}_K$; then $x\notin V(I)$ so $Q\nsupseteq I$. Therefore there exists $\beta\in I$ such that $\beta\notin Q$. The aim of the game is to show $\alpha\notin Q$. Suppose $\alpha\in Q$; then it follows that since $I^m = (\alpha)$ there exists $\gamma\in I^{m-1}, \delta\in\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\beta \gamma =\alpha\delta$. By the assumption on $\alpha$ we have $\beta\gamma\in Q$, and by assumption on $\beta$ we know $\gamma\in Q$. I want to use this to derive a contradiction because ultimately I wanted to show this would imply $\beta\in Q$, and thus the assumption $\alpha\in Q$ was wrong. But I can't figure out what to do here. Any help would be appreciated.","['schemes', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'proof-verification']"

When does this converge? $$ \sum_{m, n \geq 1} \frac{1}{(m^2 + n^2)^s} \approx \frac{\pi}{4}\int \frac{ dr }{r^{2s-1}} < \infty$$ This zeta function converges for $s > 1$ since we are adding more numbers.

I want to prove that $g$ is unique a.e., but I am stuck in one place, my attempt: Assume for contradiction that $g_1,g_2$ gives us our linear functional, but $E=\{x: g_1\ne g_2\}$, has measure larger than $0$. Then either $E_r=\{x: \Re(g_1)\ne \Re(g_2)\}$ has measure larger than zero, or $E_i$ has measure larger than zero (the imaginary counterpart). Assume that $E_r$ has measure larger than zero, a similar argument follows if $E_i$ has measure larger than zero. Then we have that either $E_r^1=\{x: \Re  g_1>\Re g_2\}$ has measure larger than zero, or $E_r^2=\{x: \Re  g_1<\Re g_2\}$ has measure larger than zero. Assume that $E_r^1$ has measure larger than zero. Then by using the trick where we write it as the union of sets where $\Re g_1 > \Re g_2+1/n$, we get that $E_r^{1,\epsilon}=\{x: \Re g_1>\Re g_2+\epsilon\}$, has measure larger than zero. Now comes the tricky part, if it happens that $E_r^{1,\epsilon}$, has finite measure, then the function $\mathcal{X}_{E_r^{1,\epsilon}}$ is in Lp, and then it is very easy to se that $\int \mathcal{X}_{E_r^{1,\epsilon}}g_1d\mu\ne\int\mathcal{X}_{E_r^{1,\epsilon}}g_2d\mu$ since they have a different real part by construction. And hence we have a contradiction, becuase both integrals are supposed to be the same since they represent the same value for the linear functional. But what do we do if $\mu(E_r^{1,\epsilon})=\infty$?

Of course, any novel question in mathematics is interesting, but there is an entire discipline of mathematics devoted to studying these eigenvalues, so they must be important. I always assumed that spectral graph theory extends graph theory by providing tools to prove things we couldn't otherwise, somewhat like how representation theory extends finite group theory.  But most results I see in spectral graph theory seem to concern eigenvalues  not as means to an end, but as objects of interest in their own right. I also considered practical value as motivation, e.g. using a given set of eigenvalues to put bounds on essential properties of graphs, such as maximum vertex degree.  But I can't imagine a situation in which I would have access to a graph's eigenvalues before I would know much more elementary information like maximum vertex degree. ( EDIT: for example, dtldarek points out that $\lambda_2$ is related to diameter, but then why would we need $\lambda_2$ when we already have diameter?  Is this somehow conceptually beneficial?) So, what is the meaning of graph spectra intuitively?  And for what practical purposes are they used?

I have heard of Lenstra's notes on Galois theory for schemes, Szamuely's book on Galois groups and fundamental groups, and Borceux and Janelidze's Galois theories book, but I'm not sure where to dive in.","['intuition', 'galois-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'algebraic-topology']"
1574999,"If $X,Y$ are positive exchangeable random variables, then $E\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right)\geq 1$.","I would like to show that if $X,Y$ are positive exchangeable random variables, then $E\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right)\geq 1$. I have used several approaches, one is iterated condtioning, the other being the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, but have not been able to find this bound. Does anyone have any ideas? I know also that a more general condition exists under which the inequality holds as well, which should involve finding concave functions and using Jensen's Inequality. Thanks!","['statistics', 'probability']"
1575003,"If I have that $X$ is a random variable satisfying $0\leq X \leq 1$, how can I show that $P\left(X \geq \frac{E(X)}{2}\right) \geq \frac{E(X)}{2}$?","If I have that $X$ is a random variable satisfying $0\leq X \leq 1$, how can I show that $P\left(X \geq \frac{E(X)}{2}\right) \geq \frac{E(X)}{2}$? I saw a footnote which gave a hint to split up $E(X)$ as two integrals over $\left[X<\frac{E(X)}{2}\right]$ and $\left[X\geq\frac{E(X)}{2}\right]$. However, I am not quite sure how to bound this integral. Would anyone have any ideas?","['statistics', 'probability']"
1575019,If $XYZ=ZXY$ does $e^Xe^Ye^Z=e^Ze^Xe^Y$?,"It is well known that if $X,Y$ are commuting matrices, then their exponential commute:
$$XY=YX\quad\implies\quad e^Xe^Y=e^Ye^X.$$
Now, I am wondering if the following generalization holds: Question: If $XYZ=ZXY$, does $e^Xe^Ye^Z=e^Ze^Xe^Y$? Note that if $Z$ commutes with both $X$ and $Y$, then it is obvious.",['linear-algebra']

1575063,Caratheodory's method,"The theorem is: Let X be a set and $\theta$ an outer measure on X. Set $\sum= \{E: E \subseteq X, \theta A=\theta(A  \cap E)+ \theta(A \backslash\ E)$ for every $A \subseteq X\}$ What is the intuition behind this definition? and what does the Caratheodory method try to achieve? Why does the fact that $\theta$ is an outer measure important?",['measure-theory']
