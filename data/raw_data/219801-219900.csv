4496711,Nonstandard algebraic geometry: Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,"I have been trying to study the basics of algebraic geometry using nonstandard analysis and I can't wrap my head around this issue. Let $^*\mathbb{C}$ be the extension of the complex numbers. Now fundamental theorem of algebra says that all polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ have solutions in $\mathbb{C}$ . It also implies that a degree $n$ polynomial will have $n$ complex solutions. By transfer, this should also be true for polynomials in $^*\mathbb{C}[x]$ . Now if you have a degree $n$ polynomial $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ , then it has $n$ zeroes in $^*\mathbb{C}$ and these zeros must all be standard. This also means that if $x \in {}^*\mathbb{C}$ is nonstandard, then $f(x) \neq 0$ . However, I'm reading Nonstandard Generic Points by Guy Wallet, and he uses Nullstellensatz to show that for a prime ideal in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ , $P$ , there is a point $x \in {}^*\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(x)=0$ iff $f \in P$ . This means there are standard polynomials that are zero on nonstandard numbers. Does this contradict the fundamental theorem of algebra? I appreciate any explanation. Thanks.","['nonstandard-analysis', 'algebraic-geometry', 'nonstandard-models', 'polynomials']"

4496923,"Spivak, Ch. 15, Problem 25. Interpretation of proof that $|\sin{x}-\sin{y}|<|x-y|$ for all numbers $x\neq y$.","Prove that $|\sin{x}-\sin{y}|<|x-y|$ for all numbers $x\neq y$ . Let $x\neq y$ . The Mean Value Theorem tells us that there is some $c\in (x,y)$ such that $$\frac{\sin{x}-\sin{y}}{x-y}=\sin'(c)=\cos(c)$$ $$\left | \frac{\sin{x}-\sin{y}}{x-y} \right | = | \cos{c}| \leq 1$$ $$|\sin{x}-\sin{y}|\leq |x-y|$$ Equality holds if $|\cos{c}|=1$ , which means $c=k\pi, k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . The claim in the problem statement is essentially that it never occurs that we have $x\neq y$ and a $c\in (x,y)$ from the MVT such that $|\cos{c}|=1$ , correct? To prove this we take two numbers $x<y$ , and a third number $z\in (x,y)$ chosen such that there is no number of form $\pi k\in (x,z)$ . Then $$|\sin{y}-\sin{x}|=|\sin{y}-\sin{z}+\sin{z}-\sin{x}|$$ $$=|(y-z)\cos{c_1}+(z-x)\cos{c_2}|\tag{1}$$ where $c_1\in(z,y)$ with $|\cos{c_1}|\leq 1$ , and $c_2\in (x,z)$ , so $c_2\neq k\pi \implies |\cos{c_2}|<1$ .

4496946,Estimate the number of conjugacy classes in a group,"Let $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ be a finite dimensional complex irreducible representation of $G$ . Let $H$ be an abelian subgroup of $G$ . I want to show that the number of irreducible characters of $G$ is greater than or equal to $\frac{\lvert H \rvert^2}{\lvert G \rvert}$ . Here's what I did: Suppose $W \neq 0$ be a subspace of $V$ that is invariant under the $H$ -action, i.e., $\rho(h)W \subseteq W$ for all $h \in H$ . Since $H$ is abelian, we can assume $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(W) = 1$ . Consider the subspace $W_0 = \sum_{g \in G}\rho(g) W$ . Since $W_0$ is $G$ -invariant and $\rho$ is irreducible, it follows that $W_0 = V$ . In addition, we note $\rho(g_1)W = \rho(g_2)W$ if $g_1H = g_2H$ . Hence, $W_0 = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}\rho(g_i)W$ , where $g_1,\dots,g_k$ are coset representatives of $G/H$ . Therefore, $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(V) \leqslant \text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(W_0) \leqslant k = \frac{\lvert G \rvert}{\lvert H \rvert}$ . To prove the statement, it suffices to show that the number of conjugacy classes in $G$ is greater than or equal to $\frac{\lvert H \rvert}{\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(V)}$ . But I don't know how to do the last part.","['group-theory', 'representation-theory']"

I feel this is a very important question to understand as it touches on some crucial aspects of the covariant derivative. Show that (without torsion) $$\left(\nabla_c\nabla_d-\nabla_d\nabla_c\right)v^a=R_{bcd}^av^b\tag{1}$$ where $$R_{bcd}^a=\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a-\partial_d \Gamma_{bc}^a+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^e-\Gamma_{ed}^a\Gamma_{bc}^e$$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. Hint: determine $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ . I'm trying to understand the following solution to the question above: $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b\tag{a}$$ $$=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\tag{b}$$ $$=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{c}$$ $$=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{ec}^a\Gamma_{bd}^ev^b + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{d}$$ on exchanging dummy $b$ and $e$ indices in the second term. Subtracting $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ gives the stated result. In order for me to make sense of the author's solution, I need to understand each of the four equalities, $(\mathrm{a})-(\mathrm{d})$ , in turn. So starting with $(\mathrm{a})$ , for a contravariant vector field $v^a(x)$ , the covariant derivative, $\nabla_{\text{cov}}$ is defined through $$\nabla_{\text{cov}}v^a=\partial_{\text{cov}}v^a+\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av^b\tag{2}$$ Similarly, for a covariant vector field $v_b(x)$ , the covariant derivative, $\nabla_{\text{cov}}$ is defined through $$\nabla_{\text{cov}}v_b=\partial_{\text{cov}}v_b-\Gamma_{b,\,{\text{cov}}}^av_a\tag{3}$$ [Please note that I have purposely used ' $\mathrm{cov}$ ' to represent the index for the covariant derivative, this was done to avoid writing say, ' $\nabla_c$ ', which would cause confusion with the notation that follows]. For a tensor field of type $(1,1)$ , $T_b^a$ , the covariant derivative of this tensor field, $\nabla_c$ is $$\nabla_c T_b^a=\partial_c T_{b}^a+\Gamma_{cd}^a T_{b}^d-\Gamma_{bc}^e T_{e}^a \tag{4}$$ Since the gradient of a vector field is a tensor (field), let the tensor (field) of type $(1,1)$ be $T_d^a=\nabla_d v^a$ . Now, using the hint at the end of the question and eqn $(4)$ , $$\begin{align}\nabla_c\left(\nabla_dv^a\right)&=\nabla_cT_d^a\\&=\partial_cT_d^a+\Gamma_{bc}^aT_d^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e T_e^a\\&=\partial_c\nabla_dv^a+\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_dv^b-\Gamma_{cd}^e \nabla_ev^a\tag{5}\end{align}$$ and this is the equivalent of $(\mathrm{a})$ in the author's solution. The next equality, $(\mathrm{b})$ , can be found by direct substitution of eqn $(2)$ into $(5)$ . To try to understand the last two equalities, $(\mathrm{c})-(\mathrm{d})$ , I multiply out eqn $(\mathrm{b})$ : $$\begin{align}\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a &=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)\\&=\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^av^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{6}\\& \stackrel{\color{red}{?}}{=}\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+ \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}\tag{7}\end{align}$$ But the final equality (marked with a red question mark above the equals sign) can only be true if out of the six terms in eqn $(6)$ we have $$\partial_c\partial_dv^a=-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a=\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b=0\tag{8}$$ and therefore I identify $$-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{9}$$ as the contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices in $(7)$ . I'll reserve asking about part $(\mathrm{d})$ for now until I have understood part $(\mathrm{c})$ . So my questions about eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ are: What justifies those particular three terms from eqn $(6)$ being equal to zero in $(8)$ , and why are the others non-zero? Is $(9)$ the unidentified symmetric contribution in the $c$ and $d$ indices eluded to $(7)$ ? Here I embed images of the question and its' solution in case I made any typos while typesetting this post: and here is the solution: Update: Even though a good answer has already been provided the part I still can't understand is the resulting expression $(\mathrm{c})$ : $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e + \text{contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices}$$ I understand how $(\mathrm{d})$ was obtained from $(\mathrm{c})$ but since my question revolves almost entirely about how to get from eqn $(\mathrm{b})$ to $(\mathrm{c})$ , for the purposes of this question and to stay consistent with the answer given by @ContraKinta I will use eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ . I think the line ""contribution symmetric in $c$ and $d$ indices"" is the part causing me the most confusion. For instance, if I were to explicitly write down these 'symmetric contributions' when indices $c$ is switched with $d$ and vice versa then I think the resulting expression should be: $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\left(\partial_{\color{blue}{d}}\Gamma_{b\color{red}{c}}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{b \color{blue}{d}}^a\Gamma_{e\color{red}{c}}^bv^e\tag{e}$$ Where the third and fourth terms are just the first and second terms repeated, respectively, but with the positions of the $d$ and $c$ indices interchanged, as marked by the blue and red colors, respectively. But this is not what I see when I look at the full expression for $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ : $$\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a=\underbrace{\partial_c\nabla_dv^a}_{(\mathrm{f})}-\underbrace{\Gamma_{dc}^b\nabla_b v^a}_{(\mathrm{g})}+\underbrace{\Gamma_{bc}^a\nabla_d v^b}_{(\mathrm{h})}$$ $$=\partial_c\left(\partial_dv^a+\Gamma_{bd}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{dc}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bc}^a\left(\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\right)$$ $$=\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b\tag{f}$$ $$-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{g}$$ $$+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e\tag{h}$$ $$=\fbox{$\partial_c\partial_dv^a+\left(\partial_c\Gamma_{bd}^a\right)v^b-\Gamma_{dc}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{dc}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\Gamma_{ed}^bv^e+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b$}$$ The labelled eqns ( $\mathrm{f}$ - $\mathrm{h}$ ) show the expansion of each of the terms above in the two equations above. There are in fact $7$ terms, the last two terms are symmetric in the $c$ and $d$ indices, that is, swapping the $c$ and $d$ indices in the 6th term of the boxed expression gives the 7th and final term, namely, $\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_d 
v^b$ . By comparing the boxed equation for $\nabla_c\nabla_dv^a$ and eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ , in fact, the only two terms common to both the boxed eqn and $(\mathrm{c})$ are the 2nd and 5th terms in the boxed eqn. So what happened to the other terms? More importantly, why did the 1st term, $\partial_c\partial_dv^a$ disappear? I can't invoke $\partial_c\partial_dv^a-\partial_d\partial_cv^a=0$ as explained in the answer as I have not subtracted off $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ yet. For the sake of completeness I will now compute $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ (though this is only for reference and is not needed to answer the questions I have here): $$\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a=\underbrace{\partial_d\nabla_cv^a}_{(\mathrm{i})}-\underbrace{\Gamma_{cd}^b\nabla_b v^a}_{(\mathrm{j})}+\underbrace{\Gamma_{bd}^a\nabla_c v^b}_{(\mathrm{k})}$$ $$=\partial_d\left(\partial_cv^a+\Gamma_{bc}^av^b\right)-\Gamma_{cd}^b\left(\partial_bv^a+\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\right)+\Gamma_{bd}^a\left(\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e\right)$$ $$=\partial_d\partial_cv^a+\left(\partial_d\Gamma_{bc}^a\right)v^b+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b\tag{i}$$ $$-\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{cd}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e\tag{j}$$ $$+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e\tag{k}$$ $$=\fbox{$\partial_d\partial_cv^a+\left(\partial_d\Gamma_{bc}^a\right)v^b-\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a-\Gamma_{cd}^b\Gamma_{eb}^av^e+\Gamma_{bd}^a\Gamma_{ec}^bv^e+\Gamma_{bc}^a\partial_dv^b+\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b$}$$ The eqns ( $\mathrm{i}$ - $\mathrm{k}$ ) simply represent expanded forms of the each of the terms in the equations above. I didn't want to resort to doing this and it was tedious to type this all out in full, but I did it for a reason: I am beginning to doubt myself on the validity of the boxed expressions I have worked out. For instance, what is to stop me writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as $\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ , namely, $a$ and the same covariant indices, $d$ and $c$ on the LHS. So I know this may seem like a question in its' own right, but I consider it to be pertinent to this post, so does this mean that $\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ?

My apologies for this and for an excessively long post, I laboured the point somewhat to convey my confusion in the most effective way I could think of. For these reasons I think that placing a bounty on this question is the least I could do. 2nd update addressing recent answers/comments: I see some very nice answers emerging, which, for the most part answers my main question; how to obtain eqn $(\mathrm{c})$ from $(\mathrm{b})$ . I would like to thank all participants for your kind help so far. One of the questions I asked that did go overlooked, was What is to stop me from writing the last term of the 2nd boxed expression as $\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ ? This term has the same contravariant index as the LHS, $\nabla_d\nabla_cv^a$ , namely, $a$ and the same covariant indices, $d$ and $c$ on the LHS? In short, does the 7th (final) term of the second boxed expression satisfy $$\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a\tag{?}$$ If that was too vague, then put another way, am I at liberty to switch around whichever tensor indices I like (even if they belong to differential operators, etc), with the caveat that I preserve the overall labelling of the contravariant and covariant indices? If any term in the expression on the LHS or RHS has a contravariant index $a$ and covariant indices $d$ and $c$ as long as this is maintained throughout all other terms may I switch the indices to different factors of the terms ( $\Gamma_{bd}^a\partial_cv^b=\Gamma_{cd}^b\partial_bv^a$ )?","['riemannian-geometry', 'proof-explanation', 'connections', 'tensors', 'calculus']"

In the center, a vector (a startracker) is aligned with the axis of rotation toward the north pole, but misaligned by a degree (say, θ_tracker = 90°- 𝛿, 𝛿=1°, φ_tracker=0°) and rotates at the same rate and in the same direction as the sky. Finally, a vector (camera) is fixed to the rotation of that vector, but is initally pointed to the star.

My question is about understanding the solution manual solution to item $(c)$ . I've asked a separate question about my own attempt at a solution which differs from the solution manual . *26. It is an excellent test of intuition to predict the value of $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx$$ Continuous functions should be the most accessible to intuition, but
once you get the right idea for a proof the limit can easily be
established for any integrable $f$ (a) Show that $\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \int_a^b \sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx=0$ , by computing the integral explicitly. (b) Show that if $s$ is a step function on $[a,b]$ , then $\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx=0$ . (c) Finally, use Problem 13-26 to show that $\lim\limits_{\lambda\to
 \infty} \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx=0$ for any function $f$ which
is integrable on $[a,b]$ . This result, like Problem 12, plays an
important role in the theory of Fourier series; it is known as the
Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Item $(a)$ is just the limit of a definite integral $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \int_a^b \sin{(\lambda x)}dx$$ $$=\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} -\frac{1}{\lambda}\left ( \cos{(\lambda d)}-\cos{(\lambda c)} \right )=0$$ For item $(b)$ , note that a step function is defined based on a partition $P=\{t_0,...,t_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ . Then $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty}\int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx=\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n s_i\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i} \sin{(\lambda x)}dx=0$$ For the items above, my solution coincided with the solution manual. For item $(c)$ my solution was different . For now I'd like to understand the solution manual solution (specifically the last part of it). Here it is Solution Manual Solution to $(c)$ For any $\epsilon>0$ there is, by Problem 13-16, a step function $s\leq f$ with $$\int_a^b [f(x)-s(x)]dx<\epsilon$$ Now $$\left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx-\int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx \right |\tag{1}$$ $$=\left | \int_a^b [f(x)-s(x)]\sin{(\lambda x)} dx \right
 |$$ $$\leq \int_a^b [f(x)-s(x)]\cdot |\sin{(\lambda x)} |dx$$ $$\leq \int_a^b [f(x)-s(x)]dx<\epsilon\tag{2}$$ So far so good Part $(b)$ then shows that $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty} \left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx \right |<\epsilon$$ Since this is true for every $\epsilon>0$ , the limit must be $0$ . I'd like to understand this last part. I think what happened is that from $(1)$ we had $$\left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx\right | -\left | \int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx \right |\leq\left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx-\int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx \right |<\epsilon$$ and then we took the limit $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty}\left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx\right | -\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty}\left | \int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx \right |<\epsilon$$ But since from $(b)$ we know that $\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty}\left | \int_a^b s(x)\sin{(\lambda
 x)}dx\right |=0$ we have $$\lim\limits_{\lambda\to \infty}\left | \int_a^b f(x)\sin{(\lambda x)}dx\right |<\epsilon$$ Is this filling in of the steps correct?","['integration', 'proof-explanation', 'calculus', 'limits', 'derivatives']"

Since $f$ and $g$ are obvious involutions, such a string could be reduced to a string of alternating applications of $f$ and $g$ . When I started to analyze such a string, I quickly came across the following: $$f \circ g \circ f \circ g \circ f \circ g \, (z) = g \circ f \circ g \circ f \circ g \circ f \, (z) = z$$ This may be a well-known property of these two functions, but I'd never come across it before and I was quite surprised by it, in particular that it took three iterations of each to become an identity - somehow I think I would have been less surprised if it had taken two or four iterations. The algebra is quite straightforward; it's easy to see that applying the first of the two above compositions gives $$z \to \frac{1}{z} \to \frac{z-1}{z} \to \frac{z}{z-1} \to \frac{1}{1-z} \to 1-z \to z$$ and that the second gives the same chain in reverse. However, this gave me no insight into why three is the magic number. I tried looking at this geometrically, but my complex geometry is admittedly pretty weak. As best as I could see, $f(z)$ reflects a point in the real axis and then inverts the image in the circle $r=1$ ; and $g(z)$ reflects a point in the line $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and then reflects the image in the real axis. Since for either function the order of the two transformations can be interchanged, when applying one function followed by the other the two reflections in the real axis would cancel each other out and result in an inversion in the circle $r=1$ followed by a reflection in the line $x=\frac{1}{2}$ , or vice-versa. However, this did not help as I could not see why doing this three times would return a point to its original position. Even restricting to just real values didn't lead to any enlightenment as the transformations would still be essentially the same. So, is there some not-too-complicated way to see why it is that three alternating iterations of each of these two functions is an identity?","['complex-analysis', 'functions']"

I'll like to solve this using Peano or Picard-Lindelöf to prove existence and uniquness if possible, but I'm confused because both theorems have as hypothesis that the function $f(s,y)$ is defined in an open neighbourhodd of the point determined by the initial conditions, in this case, $(0,\text{something})$ . What should I do in this case? Is there some kind of (relatively common) trick that works for differential equations involving square roots (or derivatives squared) that I should be aware of?

4497321,Suggested books on Leibniz notation (differentials)?,"I'm a freshman in Computer Engineering (but will probably switch to Math very soon) and I've followed some course in Analysis 1 and 2. I found the concept of differentials really interesting, but I've never really grasped the real meaning of the Leibniz notation, such as in: $$\int {x\ dx} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{dy}{dx}$$ In integrals I think of it as a multiplication between a quantity $x$ and another one $dx$ . This machine is building small rectangles that will add up to an area. I've studied the integral definitions and I know that there is definitely more behind it (particularly sums), but this is a useful representation that I have in my mind that allow me to conceptualize problems, especially in phisics. In derivatives I see $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a division, between something that I want to calculate ( $dy$ ), that is getting smaller and smaller, and an inifnitesimal distance $dx$ . But, especially for derivates, I don't really get how is it possible for the ratio of two infinitesimals to output a real number. I know that this is involved with limits, and limits can do these magical things, but it's just not intuitive for me. Not considering the last doubt, I think that there is much more about the concept of differential that I do not really know. Thus, considering our beautiful math sections we have in our university library, I'm searching for book suggestions about this awesome topic to learn something more about it!

4497323,Convergence of this finite difference sum on a small lattice,"Consider the unit box $Q_1=[0,1]^3$ and the associated network of size $\epsilon$ : $\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^3 \cap Q_1$ .

We then define the following space by restricting functions of $W_\epsilon$ to $Q_1$ : $$V_\epsilon=\{ v|_{Q_1}, \ v \in W_\epsilon\}$$ I'm considering the following sequence $(u_\epsilon)_\epsilon$ such that : $u_\epsilon \in V_\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon > 0$ $u_\epsilon$ converges toward a linear profile $x \mapsto \xi \cdot x$ in $L^2(Q_1)$ as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, where $\xi$ is a given vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ . I would like to understand the following limit if it exists : $$\underset{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{\lim} \ \epsilon \sum_{(x,y)\ \in (\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^3 \cap Q_1)^2 \\ \quad |x-y|=\epsilon} |u_\epsilon(x)-u_\epsilon(y)|^2$$ which is just a sum of finite differences over all neighboring couple $(x,y)$ on the lattice. With a quick formal analysis, we have $|u_\epsilon(x)-u_\epsilon(y)|^2 \approx |\xi \cdot(x-y)|^2 \approx |\xi|^2 \epsilon^2$ and the sum becomes $$\epsilon^3  \sum_{(x,y)\ \in (\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^3 \cap Q_1)^2 \\ \quad |x-y|=\epsilon} |\xi|^2 \approx \epsilon^3 \frac{|Q_1|}{\epsilon^3} |\xi|^2 \approx |\xi|^2 |Q_1|,$$ so much that I expect the limit to be $|\xi|^2 |Q_1| = |\xi|^2$ . However, I'm struggling to prove rigorously the result and it might be false. Do you have any clue on how to compute this limit ? For what matters, I'm also fine having just a lower estimate for the liminf of this quantity, something in this flavor: $$\underset{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{\liminf} \ \epsilon \sum_{(x,y)\ \in (\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^3 \cap Q_1)^2 \\ \quad |x-y|=\epsilon} |u_\epsilon(x)-u_\epsilon(y)|^2 \geq C |\xi^2| |Q_1|.$$ Thanks for your help.","['network', 'approximation', 'finite-differences', 'sequences-and-series']"

We have: $|f(y+h) - f(y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} |h|$ $\implies \frac{|f(y+h) - f(y)|}{|h|} \leq \frac{1}{2}$ $\implies \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{|f(y+h) - f(y)|}{|h|} \leq \frac{1}{2}  \hspace{2cm}     \ldots (1)$ $\implies |f'(y)| \leq \frac{1}{2}$ $\implies \frac{-1}{2} \leq f'(y) \leq \frac{1}{2}$ $\implies \frac{-y}{2} \leq f(y) \leq \frac{y}{2}  \hspace{2cm} \ldots (2)$ Thus we have, $ f(x) \in [\frac{-x}{2} , \frac{x}{2}]$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ , The graph of $f(x)$ must lie within the shaded portion and thus we have no solutions for $x>0$ but from the bounds it is clear that $f(0) = 0$ and we have one intersection at $(0,0)$ . The shaded portion is $ \frac{-x}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{x}{2}$ and the green line is $y = x$ , Which gives us a total of $1$ intersection.

greater than $2n/5$ is bipartite. First of all this result is vacuously true for $n=1,3,5$ . For $n=2$ and $n=4$ , it is trivially true since the desired graphs are $K_2$ and $K_{2,2}$ . We assume that $n\geq 6$ and $V(G)=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ . Since $\deg(v_1)>2n/5$ , then take $v_2\in N(v_1)$ and consider $N(v_2)$ also. It is easy to see that $N(v_1)$ and $N(v_2)$ are disjoint and independent sets. Moreover, $|V(G)\setminus (N(v_1)\sqcup N(v_2))|<n/5$ . Consider the most trivial case, when $V(G)\setminus (N(v_1)\sqcup N(v_2))=\varnothing$ . Hence $V(G)=N(v_1)\sqcup N(v_2)$ and $G$ is a bipartite graph with vertex sets $N(v_1)$ and $N(v_2)$ , i.e. $G=G[N(v_1),N(v_2)]$ .

4497545,"Finding a closed form for $((2\circledast3)\circledast4)\circledast\cdots\circledast n$, where $x \circledast y = \frac{x+y}{1+xy}$","TL;DR: I've made something work (again) but in the process I used something which makes no sense - I wonder why it all works in the end. Please explain it to me or disprove my findings. Let's define an operator $\circledast$ in this way: $x \circledast y = \frac{x+y}{1+xy}$ I want to find $$((2\circledast3)\circledast4)\circledast\cdots\circledast n, \;n \ge 3$$ My Approach First thing to notice is that: $(x \circledast y) \circledast z = x \circledast (y \circledast z)$ so it doesn't make any difference which order are we applying it and so we can remove all the parenthesis and read it as say ""left to right"". Now remembering that $\tanh(x+y)=\frac{\tanh x+\tanh y}{1+\tanh x\cdot \tanh y}$ we can see that $\tanh(\tanh^{-1}x+\tanh^{-1}y)=\frac{x+y}{1+xy} = x \circledast y$ . Therefore we can rewrite the expression we want as $S = \tanh(\tanh^{-1}2+\tanh^{-1}3+...+\tanh^{-1}n)$ , so $$\tanh^{-1}S = \sum_{k=2}^n\tanh^{-1}k$$ ""So far so good"" - I would've said, but the issue is that inverse hyperbolic tangent has only domain $(-1, 1)$ over reals. But - let's roll with it, the ""why it works"" is part of the question. From here we use the logarithmic form : $\tanh^{-1}x=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ - again, ignoring the glaring issues with the domain. We get: $$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+S}{1-S}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=2}^n\ln\left(\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\prod_{k=2}^n\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right)$$ Here's another ""red flag"" - using the logarithm property of sum to product on something that potentially doesn't exist - or even if it does, it is complex, and if I understand correctly, complex version of $\ln$ is $\mathrm{Log}$ which is multivalued so it's not right to claim $\ln(ab)=\ln(a)+\ln(b)$ . Finally, we notice that if we flip the sign of the denominator we will end up with a telescoping product on the fraction shifted by 2 on the numerator to the right. Hence we end up with this: $$\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+S}{1-S}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\prod_{k=2}^n\frac{1+k}{1-k}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left((-1)^{n-1}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)$$ We have $(-1)^{n-1}$ because there will be in total $n-1$ members (we start at $2$ and end at $n$ ). And now.. you guessed it. We got $\frac{1}{2}$ on both sides, we got $\ln$ on both sides - let's ""cancel"" them (another ""red flag"" here). If we do so we end up with $\frac{1+S}{1-S}=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ thus $$S=\frac{(-1)^{n-1}(n^2+n)-2}{(-1)^{n-1}(n^2+n)+2}$$ which is not only well-defined, but also is a correct expression for $S$ (it works for any $n$ ) Question is - why does this work despite operating on things which are not well-defined? Or am I wrong and the $\tanh^{-1}x$ is well-defined outside of $(-1,1)$ ? (as well as $\ln$ and its properties over complex numbers)? EDIT :
There's a proposed fix to the solution, courtesy of @Tortar . He has a great observation that $x \circledast y = \frac{1}{x} \circledast \frac{1}{y}$ and therefore we can avoid problematic domain issues if we rewrite $S = \frac{1}{2} \circledast \frac{1}{3} \circledast ... \circledast \frac{1}{n}$ . This, however, still has issues First, it doesn't explain why the original ""solution"" works. It all makes sense if I would apply this transformation before using $\tanh^{-1}$ but I do not, hence the question still stands More importantly - and this is why I decided to add this to the body of the question itself - this will lead to an incorrect result. That is because on the logarithms step we will get all valid $\ln\left(\frac{1+\frac{1}{k}}{1-\frac{1}{k}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{k+1}{k-1}\right)$ which means that when we will combine the fractions together and remove repeating terms from it we end up losing $(-1)^{n-1}$ as there's nothing to negate. This will lead to the final expression for $S$ being invalid for all even $n$ . Therefore while this relation establishes a link between the ""wrong"" way I do it and the ""safe"" way to do it, it looks like it's not as simple as just replacing $n$ with $\frac{1}{n}$ and something is still amiss.","['hyperbolic-functions', 'logarithms', 'proof-explanation', 'fake-proofs', 'algebra-precalculus']"

The curl of its velocity $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$ can be calculated as $$
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = (\frac{\partial v_3}{\partial x_2} -\frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_3},\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_3} -\frac{\partial v_3}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_1} -\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_2} ).
$$ From the interchangeability of ordinary and partial derivatives , $$
\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} 
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \frac{\mathrm{d}x_i}{\mathrm{d}t} 
= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x_j} 
= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \delta_{ij}
=0,
$$ which makes every component of the curl zero for any $\mathbf{x}(t)$ . However, this does not make much sense to me, since I can easily imagine a rotating velocity field. Also, such fields seem to be quite common in rotational dynamics and fluid dynamics, such as in this post . Some contexts I am trying to derive the equation of motion for a charged particle with rest charge $m$ and charge $q$ in a given electric potential $\phi(t,\mathbf{x})$ and magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}(t,\mathbf{x})$ , whose Lagrangian is given by $$
\mathcal{L} = -mc^2 \sqrt{1-|\mathbf{\dot{x}}|^2/c^2} - q \phi + q \mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \mathbf{A}.
$$ The above question arises when evaluating the term $\nabla (\mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \mathbf{A})$ (the spatial gradient), which appears in ${\partial \mathcal{L}}/{\partial x_i}$ . Using the vector calculus identities, we can evaluate the spatial gradient as $$
\nabla(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}})  =\  (\mathbf{A} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}} \,+\,  (\mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A} \,+\,  \mathbf{A} {\times} (\nabla {\times} \mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}}) \,+\,  \mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}} {\times} (\nabla {\times} \mathbf{A}) \\
= \,  (\mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A} +  \mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{x}}} {\times} (\nabla {\times} \mathbf{A}),
$$ where the second step uses the identity in the question. The answer to a similar question by Shuhao Cao (non-relativistic, but the terms of interest are identical) explains the second step as ""the usual postulate that $\mathbf{v}$ is not explicitly a function of $\mathbf{x}$ .""","['electromagnetism', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'physics']"

Here $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\Bbb R^3$ , $Y$ is any codomain, $I$ is the identity transformation, and $d$ is the standard metric on $SO(3)\subset M_{3\times3}(\Bbb R)$ . The idea is that $f$ is $\epsilon$ -uninformative if every possible orientation $t$ of the $f$ -colored sphere is indistinguishable from some orientation $u$ that's within $\epsilon$ of the reference orientation. I think a similar question is whether there exist isohedral spherical polyhedra with arbitrarily small faces (in terms of the ratio of the diameter of a face to the diameter of the polyhedron). Some web searching has led me to things like the classification of finite subgroups of $SO(3)$ and various lists of symmetric polyhedra, which often end with dodecahedral/icosahedral shapes. This leads me to suspect that the answer to my main question is no, but I'm not sure how the various types of polyhedral symmetry relate to the type of symmetry I've described.","['geometric-topology', 'symmetry', 'geometry', 'polyhedra']"

In fact, it fails drastically when we look at the class of bounded variation functions, e.g. the Cantor stair function increases from 0 to 1 however has derivative zero almost everywhere. When learning measure theory as an undergraduate, I was shown a fundamental theorem of calculus, attributed to de la Vallée Poussin, which accounts for these defects in the usual fundamental theorem of calculus for monotone functions: Theorem. (de la Vallée Poussin) Let $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be non-decreasing and continuous, and denote $\mu$ its associated Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure. Then $f$ is differentiable Lebesgue-a.e. and $\mu$ -a.e., with $|\{f' = \infty\}| = 0$ and \begin{equation}
f(b) - f(a)= \int_{(a, b] \cap \{f' < \infty\}} f' \, dx + \mu((a, b] \cap \{f' = \infty \}).

Let $A_1=[0, \infty)$ and $A_2=(-\infty,0]$ . Then $A_1 \cap A_2 = \{0\}$ so $f(A_1 \cap A_2) = \{0\}$ . However, $f(A_1) = f(A_2) = [0,\infty)$ , so $f(A_1) \cap f(A_2) = [0,\infty)$ .

4497786,Proof verification: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx\ =\ \pi\ln\left(2\right)$.,"This is more of a post I wanted to share. I have decided to tackle the following integral via contour integration: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx.$$ Proof. Let that integral equal $I$ . Let $$f(z) = \frac{\text{Log}{(z+i)}}{z^2+1},$$ where Log represents the principal logarithm. We shall traverse, in a counterclockwise direction, a path $C$ defined by $$C = \left[-R,R\right] \cup \Gamma,$$ which is a large semicircle of radius R above the real axis. We can express the contour integral over $C$ as $$\oint_Cf(z)dz = \int_{-R}^{R}f(z)dz + \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz$$ Notice the only singularity that resides in $C$ is $i$ . Taking the residue at that pole yields $$\oint_Cf(z)dz = 2\pi i\text{Res}{(f(z),i)} = 2\pi i \lim_{z \to i}f(z) = \pi\ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2},$$ after evaluating the limit and doing some algebra. By transitivity and taking the limit as R goes to infinity, we see that $$\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^{R}f(z)dz + \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz = \pi\ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2}.$$ Let's call the first and second integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ , respectively. Rewriting $I_1$ gives us $$\eqalign{\int_{-R}^{R} \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz 
  &= \int_{-R}^0 \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz + \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz \cr
  &= \int_{R}^0 \frac{\text{Log}(-y+i)}{(-y)^2+1}d(-y) + \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz \cr
  &= \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}((i-y)(i+y))}{y^2+1}dy \cr
&= i\frac{\pi^2}{2} + \int_0^R \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy\cr}$$ after doing some basic manipulations and integration. Note if $|z| = R$ , then $z$ is on $R$ . Dealing with $I_2$ as $R$ approaches infinity, consider the following inequalities: $$|\text{Log}(z+i)| = |\ln|z+i| + i\text{Arg}(z+i)| \leq ||z+i| + i\pi| \leq R+1+\pi;$$ $$\left|z^2+1\right| \geq \left|\left|z^2\right|-1\right| = R^2 - 1.$$ By applying the ML-Inequality and Squeeze Theorem, we get $$0 \leq \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq |f(z)|\left(\frac{2\pi R}{2}\right) \leq \frac{R+1+\pi}{R^2-1}$$ $$\lim_{R \to \infty} 0 \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \frac{R+1+\pi}{R^2-1}$$ $$0 \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq 0.$$ This implies that $$\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz = 0.$$ Going back and taking R to infinity, we see that $$\eqalign{
\pi \ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2} 
  &= i\frac{\pi^2}{2} + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy + 0 \cr
  \pi \ln{(2)} &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy. \cr
}$$ Letting $y = \sinh{(x)}$ , we get $$
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy = \int_0^{\infty}\frac{\ln{(\sinh^2{(x)}+1)}\cosh{(x)}}{\sinh^2{(x)}+1}dx = 2\int_0^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx.
$$ Since $\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)$ is an even function, we see that $$2\int_0^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx.$$ Therefore, $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx\ =\ \pi\ln\left(2\right).$$ Q.E.D.

Le, the first product of four groups be denoted by $G= a\times b\times c\times d$ , and the second by $H= e\times f\times g\times h.$ The choice need to show equal order, while failing at Isomorphism. So, $G_1= C_{16}\times C_1\times C_1\times C_1$ , and $H= C_8\times C_8\times C_1\times C_1$ will not help; as then will have equal orders as well as Isomorphism too.

Then, $u_1,. . .,u_4,w_1,. . .,w_4$ spans $U+W$ . Because $U+W$ is a subspace of $C^6$ , the $\dim(U+W)\le 6$ . Thus, $u_1,. . .,u_4,w_1,. . .,w_4$ can be reduced to a basis of $U+W$ . In the process, none of the $u's$ get removed as $u_1,. . .,u_4$ is linearly independent. Thus, some of the $w's$ get removed in the process. Because $\dim(U+W)\le 6$ , at least two of the $w's$ get removed. These are the $w's\in U\cap W$ . Because $w_1, . .,w_4$ is linearly independent, none of these two vectors are a scalar multiple of each other. Is the proof correct? Edit: I implicitly use that theorem that every spanning list in a vector space can be reduced to a basis of that vector space. In the process, we remove those vectors that are in the span of the previous ones. Thus, if we have the list $v_1,. . .,v_k$ . We remove $v_j$ only if $v_j$ is in the span of $v_1,. . .,v_{j-1}$ . Edit 2: I have come to know that the proof is wrong. For future readers, I am writing another proof that is also suggested as a hint in the answers. Proof 2: Using the formula $\dim (U+W)=\dim(U)+\dim(W)-\dim(U\cap W)$ , we see that $\dim(U\cap W) \ge 2$ . This is because $\dim(C^6)=6$ and $U+W$ is a subspace of $C^6$ . Thus, $\dim(U+W)\le 6$ .

I searched using Approach0 and it led me to a post on AOPS without solutions. I have to admit that I don't know how to start. First of all, it is easy to notice that if we have a subsequence $\{a_{n_k}\}$ with $a_{n_k}\geq 1$ for all $k$ , then we must have $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \left(n^2(4a_n(1-a_{n-1})-1)\right)\leq0\leq \frac14$ ; also, the case where there are infinitely many $0$ 's is easy to handle. So, WLOG we can assume that $a_n\in(0,1)$ for all $n$ . Secondly, notice that $4x(1-x)-1=-(2x-1)^2\leq 0$ , with equality holds iff $x=\frac12$ . It may suggest that $\frac12$ is an important number here. Now it seems natural to write $a_n=\frac12+b_n$ , so we have $b_n\in(-1/2,1/2)$ and we want to prove that $$\liminf_{n\to\infty}\left(n^2(b_n-b_{n-1}-2b_nb_{n-1})\right)\leq\frac18.$$ But this is not obvious, either. Remark. The bound $1/4$ (or $1/8$ in terms of $b_n$ ) is sharp. If we choose $b_n=-\frac1{4n}$ , or equivalently $a_n=\frac12-\frac1{4n}$ for $n\geq1$ , then $$n^2(b_n-b_{n-1}-2b_nb_{n-1})=\frac{n^2}{8n(n-1)}\to\frac18,\qquad n\to\infty.$$ The above are simplest (kind of silly) observations.

Let $T_1,\dots,T_n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Let $(\hat{Y}_1,\dots,\hat{Y}_n)$ be the solution of the quadratic constrained minimization problem \begin{equation*}
   \min_{0\le\hat{y}_1\le\dots\le\hat{y}_n\le1} \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{t=1}^{T_k}(\hat{y_k}-Y_{k,t})^2
\end{equation*} I'm looking for Hoeffding's inequality type guarantees for these estimators. Precisely, can we found (sharp, or nearly sharp, and hopefully better than the ones that hold for Hoeffding's inequality) constants $c_1,c_2>0$ such that, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , each $0\le y_1 \le \dots\le y_n \le 1$ , each $T_1,\dots, T_n\in\mathbb{N}$ , each $a_1,\dots,a_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and each $\delta\in (0,1)$ it holds \begin{equation*}
   \mathbb{P}\bigg[ \bigg| \sum_{k=1}^n a_k\hat{Y}_k- \sum_{k=1}^n a_ky_k\bigg|\ge \sqrt{c_1 \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{a_k^2}{T_k} \log \Big(\frac{c_2}{\delta}\Big)}    \bigg] \le \delta \;?
\end{equation*} (Notice that this inequality would hold with $c_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $c_2 = 2$ if we replace each estimator $\hat{Y}_k$ with $\frac{1}{T_k} \sum_{t=1}^{T_k} Y_{k,t}$ , due to Hoeffding's inequality ). Even the cases where all the $a_k$ are $0$ except one whose value is $1$ , or all the $a_k$ are $0$ except two whose value is $-1$ and $1$ respectively, or all the $a_k$ are equal to $1/n$ , would be interesting for me. I've seen that the solution to the previous minimization problem goes under the name isotonic regression , but I realized that the literature is extremely vast and found myself quickly lost.

4498328,Does the $32$-inator exist?,"Background It is common popular-math knowledge that as we extend the real numbers to complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions, $32$ -nions, etc. using the Cayley-Dickson construction , we lose algebraic properties at each step such as commutativity, associativity, alternativity, etc. We can express this phenomenon in a more illustrative way. Consider the following multilinear maps $F_k$ of degree $k$ : Number two: $F_0: [\:] = 1 - (-1) = 2$ . Imaginary part: $F_1: [x] = x - x^*$ . Commutator: $F_2: [x, y] = xy - yx$ . Associator: $F_3: [x, y, z] = (xy)z - x(yz)$ . $16$ -inator: $F_4: [x, y, z, w] = (x(yz))w+(w(yz))x-(xy)(zw)-(wy)(zx)$ . They measure the failure of the algebra to be of characteristic two, Hermitian, commutative, associative and Moufang , respectively. All of them are well-known except for the last one, which I adapted from the quadrilinear map described in section 5 of this paper and essentially comes from a linearized Moufang identity. (Note that depending on the convention, imaginary part, commutator and associator are often defined with an extra factor of $1/2$ , and in the context of complex numbers, imaginary part almost always refers to $F_1$ divided by $2i$ ). Since the maps are multilinear, they are determined by their values at the basis elements $1=e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots, e_{2^n-1}$ (under the standard labeling) in the $n$ th Cayley-Dickson algebra over the reals. All the maps above with degree $k \le n$ can then be checked to satisfy the following properties: (A1) $[e_a, e_b, e_c, \ldots] = m e_i$ for some $i$ , where $m\in\{-2,0,2\}$ . (A2) $[e_a, e_b, e_c, \ldots] = 0$ whenever $a, b, c, \ldots <2^{k-1}$ . (A3) $[e_1, e_2, e_4, \ldots, e_{2^{k-1}}] = 2 e_{2^{k}-1}$ . (A4) If $[x, y, \ldots] = z$ , then $[\sigma(x), \sigma(y), \ldots] = \sigma(z)$ for any algebra automorphism $\sigma$ . Properties (A2) and (A3) together imply (rather trivially) that given a Cayley-Dickson algebra $\mathbb{A}$ , $F_k$ vanishes in the next algebra $CD(\mathbb{A})$ if and only if both $F_k$ and $F_{k-1}$ vanish in $\mathbb{A}$ ; for $k < 4$ this fact holds in more generality for any $*$ -algebra (see e.g. here ) and provides a more uniform way to explain why commutativity, associativity, etc. break in sequence as we iterate the Cayley-Dickson process. But rather than talk about algebraic properties, for the purposes of this question I would like to treat the maps themselves as the objects of interest. So let these properties (and multilinearity) be the axioms that define a $2^n$ -inator in a real Cayley-Dickson algebra. The first four maps $F_0, \ldots, F_3$ are in fact uniquely determined by these axioms when $k=n$ . For example, (A3) implies $[\:]=2e_0=2$ ; (A2) and (A3) together with linearity imply $[a e_0+b e_1] = a[e_0]+b[e_1] = a\cdot 0 + b\cdot 2e_1 = 2b e_1$ ; the map $F_2$ in the quaternions is completely fixed by (A2), (A3) and (A4) applied twice, with an automorphism that cyclically permutes the imaginary basis elements and with the involution $e_1 \mapsto e_2, e_2 \mapsto e_1, e_3 \mapsto -e_3$ ; and similarly for $F_3$ in the octonions. I haven't checked whether the $16$ -inator in the sedenions is uniquely recovered from the axioms, but I suspect it's probably nonunique, since the automorphism groups of the sedenions and above are ""small"" relative to the size of the algebras (the groups are all isomorphic to the $14$ -dimensional octonionic automorphism group ( $G_2$ ) times a finite group, while the algebras themselves double their dimension at each step). Nevertheless, it is natural to ask if one can continue the sequence by finding nontrivial examples of $F_k$ for $k>4$ ; my main question deals with the smallest case $k=n=5$ . This paper implies that if a $F_5$ exists, it is necessarily not expressible in terms of multiplication and real constants alone, unlike $F_0, F_2, F_3$ and $F_4$ . There could still be a closed-form expression if we allow the use of conjugation as with $F_1$ , but it looks unlikely to me. The possibility of using non-real constants seems more promising, because the automorphism groups of sedenions and above do not act transitively on imaginary elements of norm $1$ , so some basis elements are ""more special"" than others. In fact, one can define new ""conjugations"" $x^{(8)} = e_{8} x e_{8}$ , $x^{(16)} = e_{16} x e_{16}$ , etc. which can be shown to be invariant under all automorphisms of the algebra; this follows from Lemma 2.1 here . An obvious followup to my main question would be whether the $2^n$ -inators can be expressed in terms of multiplication, real constants, and the conjugations $x^*, x^{(8)}, x^{(16)}, x^{(32)}, \ldots, x^{(2^n)}$ . But in principle it's not guaranteed that $F_n$ will be algebraically expressible at all, if it exists. Question My question is: Is there a $32$ -inator in the $32$ -nions, i.e. a multilinear map $F_5: [x,y,z,w,v]$ satisfying axioms (A1)-(A4)? Followup: can it be expressed in terms of multiplication, real constants and conjugations? Such a map would necessarily be nontrivial by (A3), and would be identically zero in any sedenion subalgebra by (A2) and (A4). Some remarks: In page 12 of the paper I linked above, it is suggested that the possible existence of higher-order maps might be related to projective geometry over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ . The first problem looks simple enough that it could be solved with a computer search, but the search space seems to be quite large at first glance. The obvious upper bound on possible cases to check, taking into account only multilinearity and (A1), would be $(2\cdot 32 + 1)^{32^5} = 65^{2^{25}} \lesssim 2^{2^{28}}$ . Perhaps some clever argument could reduce this bound to a more manageable number.","['octonions', 'abstract-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra', 'sedenions', 'recreational-mathematics']"

4498434,Is this proof of a binary representation rigorous?,"From what I have seen so far, intro discrete math books usually provide a proof that every natural number can be uniquely expressed as a sum of distinct powers of $2$ in two steps: proving the (1) existence, and then (2) uniqueness. I believe that I have found a way that combines both statements, and I wonder if it may be used as a rigorous proof since it does not look ""typical."" Claim: Any natural number $N\geq1$ may be uniquely expressed as a sum $N=\sum_{k=1}^{n}2^{a_k}$ , where $a_{1}<a_{2}<...<a_{n}.$ Proof: Suppose $\exists X\subset\mathbb{N} \ \ | \ \  X=\{N\in\mathbb{N}:N\neq\sum_{k=1}^{n}2^{a_k}$ }, then, by the Well-Ordering Principle, there exists the smallest element $x\in X,$ which is the smallest counterexample. Therefore, suppose the claim is true for $x-1$ . We need to rule out the possibility of $x=1,$ since $1-1=0\ngeq1.$ Thus, Basis case: $1=2^{0}.$ Since the claim is true for $x-1$ , $x-1=2^{a_1}+2^{a_2}+2^{a_3}+...+2^{a_n},\implies x=1+2^{a_1}+2^{a_2}+2^{a_3}+...+2^{a_n}=2^0+2^{a_1}+2^{a_2}+2^{a_3}+...+2^{a_n}.$ If $\nexists a_i=0$ for $i= \{ 1,2,...,n\},$ then the binary representation for $x$ exists and is unique. Hence, we reach a contradiction, and the claim is true. If $\exists a_i=0$ for $i= \{ 1,2,...,n\},$ then $2^{0}+2^{a_i}=2^0+2^0=2^1.$ Similarly, if $\nexists a_i=1$ for $i= \{ 1,2,...,n\},$ then the binary representation for $x$ exists and is unique. However, once again, if $\exists a_i=1$ for $i= \{ 1,2,...,n\},$ then $2^{1}+2^{a_i}=2^1+2^1=2^2.$ Continuing like that, we either stop at a particular $a_i<n$ which was not used in the expression for $x-1$ (and get a unique representation), or finally run into the case $a_i>n$ , which is obviously also unique as $a_i$ has not been used in an expression for $x-1$ . Thus, since the binary representation for $x$ exists ( $\Rightarrow \! \Leftarrow$ ), the claim is proven.","['induction', 'examples-counterexamples', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4498457,Which ultrafilters are (sort-of) commutators?,"There is a natural way to extend a binary operation $\star$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ to a semicontinuous binary operation $\widehat{\star}$ on $\beta\mathbb{Z}$ , the latter being the set of ultrafilters on $\mathbb{Z}$ ; see here (replacing $\mathbb{N}$ with $\mathbb{Z}$ as appropriate) . In general, algebraic properties of $\star$ are not preserved by this extension - e.g. $\widehat{+}$ has nontrivial idempotents and is non-commutative - but this extension can nonetheless be useful. I'm interested in understanding how noncommutative $\widehat{+}$ is (right now, the best result I know is that it has trivial center ). Normally one might attack this sort of question by looking at the commutator subgroup of $(\beta\mathbb{Z};\widehat{+})$ , but since $\widehat{+}$ is non-cancellative this doesn't make sense. We can however whip up a ""brute force"" analogue by considering $\widehat{+}$ and $\widehat{-}$ explicitly. This leads to the following: Question 1 : Is every nonprincipal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ equal to $$[(\mathcal{W}_1\widehat{+}\mathcal{W}_2)\widehat{-}\mathcal{W}_1]\widehat{-}\mathcal{W}_2$$ for some ultrafilters $\mathcal{W}_1,\mathcal{W}_2$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ ? Of course, this is a rather naive attempt to whip up a commutator-like notion: Question 2 : Is there a more useful analogue of the notion of commutator when looking at non-cancellative semigroups (namely $(\beta\mathbb{Z};\widehat{+})$ )? I know that there is a lot of universal algebra around generalized commutator theory , but to my limited understanding it works best when the algebra in question is (say) congruence modular, and it's not clear to me whether $(\beta\mathbb{Z};\widehat{+})$ is congruence modular.","['universal-algebra', 'logic', 'semigroups', 'general-topology', 'set-theory']"

4498517,Evaluating curl of $\hat{\textbf{r}}$ in cartesian coordinates,"I am reading book about Classical Mechanics, which states that a spherically symmetric central force is always conservative, and I want to prove it. Spherical symmetry of a function $f$ means that in spherical coordinates the partial derivatives wrt the polar and azimuthal angles are zero: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}=0$$ (I am using the mathematician's convention that $\phi$ is the polar and $\theta$ is the azimuth.) A central force is just a force of the form $\textbf{F}=f(\textbf{r})\hat{\textbf{r}}$ , where $\textbf{r}$ is the position. Thus, a spherically symmetric central force is of the form $\textbf{F}=f(r)\hat{\textbf{r}}$ . The task to show this to be conservative, which is the same as showing that the curl vanishes (a result of Stokes' theorem). So the task is: $\nabla\times f(r)\hat{\textbf{r}}=0$ Now, I can easily evaluate this curl in spherical coordinates without a problem, but I do want to evaluate this in cartesian coordinates just to see that it works, despite the fact that it's probably a bad idea. Anyway, $\hat{\textbf{r}}$ in cartesian coordinates is $$\hat{\textbf{r}}=\sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)\hat{\textbf{x}}+\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\hat{\textbf{y}}+\cos(\phi)\hat{\textbf{z}}$$ For simplicity, I ignore the $f(r)$ factor. The curl is $$\nabla\times \hat{\textbf{r}}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial \cos(\phi)}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)}{\partial z}\\
\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial \cos(\phi)}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}$$ I thought that I could use the chain rule on $\frac{\partial\cos(\phi)}{\partial y}$ in a perhaps hand-wavy manner: $$\frac{\partial\cos(\phi)}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial\cos(\phi)}{\partial \phi}\left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial\cos(\phi)}{\partial \phi}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi}\right)^{-1}$$ But I tried it on the $x$ coordinate: $$\frac{\partial \cos(\phi)}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)}{\partial z}=$$ $$\frac{\partial\cos(\phi)}{\partial \phi}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi}\right)^{-1}-\frac{\partial \sin(\phi)}{\partial \phi}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \phi}\right)^{-1}\sin(\theta) -\frac{\partial \sin(\theta)}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta}\right)^{-1}\sin(\phi)=$$ $$-\sin(\phi)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi}\right)^{-1}-\cos(\phi)\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \phi}\right)^{-1}\sin(\theta) -\cos(\theta)\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta}\right)^{-1}\sin(\phi)= (*)$$ We know: $y=r\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)$ , $z=r\cos(\phi)$ , so we obtain $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial \phi}=-r\sin(\phi)\qquad \frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi}=r\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)$$ $$(*)=-\sin(\phi)\left(r\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\right)^{-1}-\cos(\phi)\left(-r\sin(\phi)\right)^{-1}\sin(\theta) -\cos(\theta)\left(-r\sin(\phi)\right)^{-1}\sin(\phi)$$ $$=-\tan(\phi)/r\sin(\theta)+\sin(\theta)/r\tan(\phi) +\cos(\theta)/r$$ $$=\frac{\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)\tan(\phi)-\tan(\phi)\sin(\theta)}{r\sin(\theta)\tan(\phi)}$$ $$\neq 0$$ I suspect something went wrong during the application of the chain rule.

Moreover, $f_t(x)=\frac{g(x)}{g(t)}\varphi(t-x+k)$ where $g>
0$ is the probability density function of a continuous unbounded support random variable and $\varphi$ is the probability density function of a standard normal ( $k$ being a constant). It is clear that $\lim_{t\to\infty}\psi_t(x)$ is pointwise $0$ . As a consequence, whenever I can bound $|\psi_t(x)|$ by an integrable function it's easy to conclude $\mathcal{I}=0$ by dominated convergence theorem. The ratio appearing in the integrand is always smaller than one (at least when $g$ is eventually decreasing) but, since the $f$ factor translates, it is difficult to find the desired bound. Actually, depending on shape of $g$ , this may not be possible.Indeed, numerical simulation suggest that, for many interesting choices of $g$ , we have $\mathcal{I}\neq 0$ . In these cases, it seems that it must not be possible to exchange integral and limit. How to proceed ?

4498529,Asymptotics applied to approximate solutions of trascendental equations,"I'm self studying ""Olver - Asymptotics and Special Functions"": I'm new to asymptotics and so there are some things I am not getting. First, the author states the following theorem: Theorem 3.1. Let $\sum_{s=0}^\infty a_s z^s$ converge when $|z|<r$ . Then for fixed $n$ it is $\sum_{s=n}^\infty a_s z^s=O(z^n)$ in any disk $|z|\le\rho$ such that $\rho <r$ . And proceeds to study the asymptotic behavior of the roots of trascendental equations: for instance, he considers the equation $x \tan x=1$ for large $x>0$ . Inverting, it is $x=n\pi+\arctan(1/x)$ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ for the principal value of arctan. Since arctan is bounded, it is $x \sim n\pi$ as $n \to \infty$ . Since for $x>1$ the Taylor's series of $\arctan(1/x)$ converges, he then writes: $$x=n\pi+\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{3x^3}+\frac{1}{5x^5}-\frac{1}{7x^7}+\dots$$ Finally, he claims that hence $x=n\pi+O(x^{-1})=n\pi+O(n^{-1})$ and that next two substitutions produce $$x=n\pi+\frac{1}{n\pi}+O\left(\frac{1}{n^3}\right) \tag{1}$$ $$x=n\pi+\frac{1}{n\pi}-\frac{4}{3(n\pi)^3}+O\left(\frac{1}{n^5}\right) \tag{2}$$ First question: why is it $n\pi+O(x^{-1})=n\pi+O(n^{-1})$ ? I know that $f(x)=O(g(x))$ as $x \to x_0$ means that $|f(x)|\le K|g(x)|$ for some constant $K$ in a neighborhood of $x_0$ , maybe this comes from the Archimedean property and I can always find a natural $n$ such that $n<x$ and so $\frac{1}{x}<\frac{1}{n}$ , so I can say (for $x>0$ ) that $f(x)=O(x^{-1})\implies f(x)\le \frac{K}{x}<\frac{K}{n}\implies f(x) \le \frac{K}{n} \implies f(x)=O(n^{-1})$ ? Or this is wrong and he is using another kind of reasoning? Second question: I am not getting the calculations to obtain equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ . What I tried so far is the following. From theorem 3.1 with $n=1$ , I know that $$x=n\pi+\frac{1}{x}+O\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right)$$ Substituting $x=n\pi+O(n^{-1})$ and using the properties $O(cf)=O(f)$ for $c>0$ , $fO(g)=O(fg)$ and $O(f)O(g)=O(fg)$ , it is $$x=n\pi+\frac{1}{n\pi+O\left(\frac{1}{n\pi}\right)}+O\left(\frac{1}{\left(n\pi+O\left(\frac{1}{n\pi}\right)\right)^3}\right)=n\pi+\frac{1}{n\pi+O\left(\frac{1}{n\pi}\right)}+O\left(\frac{1}{n^3\pi^3+O(n)+O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)+O\left(\frac{1}{n^3}\right)}\right)$$ But I don't know how to manipulate the big-Os in the denominators.
