1487616,Uniformly integrable implies integrable?,"The term ""uniformly integrable"" sounds (to a layman like me) to be stronger than integrable. Just like how uniformly convergent is stronger than simply being convergent. However, from the definition of uniformly integrable, I can't seem to see how if a family of measurable functions is uniformly integrable, then each function is integrable ($\int f_n <\infty$). Thanks for any help! I am sure it is quite trivial but I can't see it immediately. I post the definition of uniformly integrable as stated in my lecture notes:
A family $\mathcal{H}$ of measurable functions on $E$ is said to be uniformly integrable over $E$ provided for each $\epsilon >0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $f\in\mathcal{H}$, if $A\subseteq E$ is measurable with $m(A)<\delta$, then $\int_A |f|<\epsilon$.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1487672,"Complex Analysis, the Sum of Residues is Imaginary?","I'm trying to solve this problem using complex analysis: $\int_0^\infty\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^2-2x+3}\, dx$ I'm using a contour that avoids the branch cut along the +x axis of the complex plane, looking like a block capital C. Ive shown that the two circular portions of the contour drop to zero as you shrink the inner circular contour and grow the outer one. The remaining two straight portions of the contour sum to be twice that of the intergral I'm trying to solve. The problem is the the poles of the above formula give residues of: $\frac{1}{2} i \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i}{2}} $ and $\frac{-1}{2} i \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2}} $ Here's my problem: $2 \pi i \sum \text{Residues}$ is an completely imaginary number, giving my integral no real value.

1487692,How do I find an integer value for which an expression is non-prime?,"I've just begun Robert S. Wolf's, Proof, Logic and Conjecture . At the end of the first chapter there are some exercises to warm you up for the proof techniques he will eventually introduce. I only mention this so that you are aware that I have yet to encounter formal proof techniques. The first part of the question simply asks you to substitute small values of $n$ into the expression $n^2-n+41$ and to test if these values are prime. I did this for $n=1$ to $12$ , and all the values seemed prime. This leads me onto the second part of the question where I am stuck. I'll paraphrase the question: (1)(b) Find a positive integer value of $n$ for which the expression $n^2-n+41$ is not a prime number. My attempt I will decompose the expression $n^2-n+41$ into symbolic and numeric parts i.e. $n^2-n$ and $41$ , in order to obtain a better understanding of it. The symbolic part of the expression $n^2-n$ can be factorised to $n(n-1)$ . From this it is apparent that this portion of the expression will only ever return even values, because it will always be of the form where we have an odd number multiplied by an even number. For example: for $n=5$ , an odd number, we have $5(5-1)=5(4)=20$ ; similarly for $n=4$ , an even number, we have $4(4-1)=4(3)=12$ . The addition of an odd number and even number returns an odd number, thus the addition of $41$ (an odd number) to $n^2-n$ (an expression which always returns even numbers) will give an odd number for all integer values of $n$ . As $n^2-n+41$ always returns odd numbers, it then stands to reason that if we are to find any non-prime value of this expression it will also be odd. The only way I could think of doing this was by defining the odd numbers as $2n+1$ , (where $2n$ is an even number and $n$ is an integer) and equating this to the expression in the hope that the intersection would return values that are odd and non-prime, however it is not the case that this equivalence returned an integer value of $n$ for which this expression is not prime.

1487698,Why are open and simply connected required for $\frac{\delta P}{\delta y} = \frac{\delta Q}{\delta x}$ to imply a conservative field?,"A theorem concerning line integrals runs as follows: I want to develop some intuition as to why this theorem depends on $D$ being open and simply-connected. My thoughts: $D$ being closed (that is, intuitively, if the region had a boundary) should have no bearing on whether $F$ is conservative. A conservative vector field could still exist on boundary points (I can still run around the boundary in two paths from an incident point to a final one and aggregate some equal quantity). If $D$ were not simply connected by, say, containing a hole inside of it, the hole wouldn't be a part of $D$. This means that $\frac{\delta P}{\delta y} = \frac{\delta Q}{\delta x}$  being true still implies a conservative field at all other points (which, collectively form D). Hence, $F$  can still be considered conservative.","['vector-fields', 'vectors', 'multivariable-calculus']"
1487773,The identity det(A) = exp(Tr(ln(A)) for A general,"I understand the proof of the identity in the title for $A$ Hermitian. One uses that any Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized as $A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$, such that

$$

1487778,An example showing that van der Waerden's theorem is not true for infinite arithmetic progressions,"One of the possible formulations of Van der Waerden's theorem is the following: If $\mathbb N=A_1\cup \dots\cup A_k$ is a partition of the set $\mathbb N$, then one of the sets $A_1,\dots,A_k$ contains finite arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length. In the other words, if we color the set of all positive integers by finitely many colors, there must be a monochromatic set containing arbitrarily long finite arithmetic progressions. I assume that the same result is not true if we require that one of the sets contain an infinite arithmetic progression.  (Otherwise this result would be well-known.)

Prove that $M_k(G)$ is a matroid for all $k \geq 0$. My partial solution: $M_0(G) = (E, S), F \in S$ if and only if $F$ forest. $\{\emptyset\}$ is in $S$. No cycles, therefore a forest. Downward closed : $S$ is downward closed, as every subgraph of a forest is also a forest and therefore also independent (i.e in $S$). The exchange property : Let $F_1, F_2 \in S$ be forests where $|F_1| = |F_2| + 1$. The number of vertices is given by $|V| = |F_1| + k_1 = |F_2| + k_2$, where $k_i$ is the number of trees in the forest. Therefore, $k_1 = k_2 - 1$, which means that there must exist an edge $F_1 \setminus F_2$ which connects two trees in $F_1$. Does axiom still hold for $k > 0$?

  $$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\sin(nx) dx \,.
$$ LDCT is a no go, as well as MCT and FL, which are really the only integration techniques we've developed thus far in the course. Integration by parts isn't applicable either since we just have $f \in L^1$. I've tried splitting both $f$ and $\sin(nx)$ into unsigned parts but that didn't seem to help. I don't think using the density of $C_c(\mathbb{R}) \subset L^1$ will help either. I've tried approximating $f$ by simple functions, but that didn't seem to do the trick either.. To give you a gauge in regards to where we are at, we just finished basic properties of $L^p$ spaces and will begin Hilbert Space Theory as in Big Rudin. Any hints are greatly appreciated. Edit: Let $h \in C^1_c(\mathbb{R})$ be such that $\sup \limits_{x \in X}|f(x)-h(x)| < \epsilon.$ Let $\operatorname{supp}(h) = [a,b]$. Then, \begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} h(x)\sin(nx) \, dx &=& \int_{[a,b]} h(x)\sin(nx) \, dx \\
&=& \left[h(x) \frac{\cos(nx)}{n} \right] + \int_{[a,b]} \frac{1}{n} f'(x) \cos(nx) \, dx \\
\end{eqnarray*} note that since $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, it is bounded by some $M$. Thus, $\frac{1}{n}f'(x)\cos(nx) \leq \frac{M}{n}$, which converges to $0$ uniformly. Taking limits yields that $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\sin(nx) dx = 0.$$ Alternatively, if we use a simple function approximation, we end up with something of the form $$\int_\mathbb{R} \sum_{i=1}^{k}c_i \chi_{E_i}(x)\sin(nx)dx = \sum_{i=1}^k c_i \int_{E_i} \sin(nx)dx$$ which goes to $0$ as $n \to \infty$ (The $E_i$'s can be chosen to be disjoint), but the below question still remains.

Let $P$ (short for $P(x_1,\dots,x_n) = 1$) be an equational property that may or may not be satisfied by all $n$-tuples of elements of $G$. My question is: What $P$ are such that $P$ being satisfied on $S$ implies that it is satisfied on all of $G$? Is there a simple characterization? (If so, do you know a proof?) Is this a hard question with a developed theory? (If so, can you point me to relevant sources?) Examples of $P$'s: (1) If $P$ is $[x_1,x_2]= x_1x_2x_1^{-1}x_2^{-1}=1$, then $P$ being satisfied on $S$ implies that it is satisfied on $G$. Indeed if pairs of generators commute, then words on those generators clearly commute since the generators can ""slip past each other."" (2) On the other hand, if $P$ is $x_1^2=1$, then $P$ being satisfied on $S$ says nothing about $G$. For an extremely hands-on example, $S_3$ is generated by two elements of order $2$, but not all its elements are order $2$. Motivating example: What got me interested in this in the first place was that I was wondering if free metabelian groups (on a finite number of generators) are finitely presented. Does the relation $[[x_1,x_2],[x_3,x_4]] = 1$ that defines metabelianness carry over from a generating set to the whole group?

Now suppose that $m$ is a common divisor of $4k + 1$ and $4k − 1$ . If $m ≤ 0$ , then certainly $m < 1$ . Suppose that $m > 0$ . Since $m$ divides both $4k - 1$ and $4k + 1$ , $m$ divides every linear combination
of $4k + 1$ and $4k − 1$ . In particular, $m$ divides $(4k + 1) − (4k − 1) = 2$ . Since $m \mid 2$ and $2$ is prime, $m = 1$ or $m = 2$ . But $4k + 1 = 2(2k) + 1$ is odd and thus is not divisible by $2$ . Thus $m = 1$ , and so $m \leq 1$ .

1488243,"Hermite Functions and Multiplication Operators: Why is the ""obvious"" equation correct?","Question: Let $T$ be the unbounded operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ defined by
$$Tf(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x f(x) - f^{\prime}(x) \right), $$
with domain $\mathfrak{D}(T)$ restricted to the set where $xf(x)$ and $f^{\prime}(x)$ are each, separately, in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ (and we permit $f^{\prime}(x)$ to be a distributional derivative). It is known (e.g., Folland's Real Analysis , Exercise 8.23 (a -- c)) that $T h_k(x) = \sqrt{k + 1} h_{k + 1}(x)$, where $h_k(x)$ is the $k$th Hermite function (precise definition below). Of course, the Hermite functions form an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, so for any $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$, we may write
$$f(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k h_k(x).$$ I would like to write then that for any $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$, $$Tf(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k T h_k(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k \sqrt{k + 1} h_{k + 1}(x);$$
certainly, this would be true for finite sums. How do I justify the linearity across the infinite sum? Motivation: Let the (physicist's) Hermite functions be defined by
$$h_k(x) = \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{\sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!}} e^{x^2/2} \left( \frac{d}{dx} \right)^k e^{-x^2}, \quad k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace;$$
they form an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We define $\ell^2$ to be the space of square-summable sequences, where we let the sequences be indexed starting at $0$ for convenience.  Then by $h_k(x)$ an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we know that the map $\iota: \ell^2 \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$ given by
\begin{equation}
\iota \left( (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \right) := \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} c_k h_k(x)
\end{equation}
is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces. I wish to relate conditions on the decay of the coefficients to the integrability of the resulting functions.  Let
$$\mathfrak{L}_1 = \left\lbrace (c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2: (\sqrt{k + 1} c_k)_{k = 0}^{\infty} \in \ell^2 \right\rbrace$$
and 
$$\mathfrak{D}_1 = \left\lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): xf(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}), s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \right\rbrace,$$
where $\widehat{f}(s)$ is the Fourier transform of $f$, under the convention
\begin{equation} 
\widehat{f}(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{- i \pi x \cdot s} \, dx, \quad f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}).
\end{equation} I wish to show that $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) = \mathfrak{D}_1$. I can handle the inclusion $\iota (\mathfrak{L}_1) \subseteq \mathfrak{D}_1$. We know that
\begin{equation} \tag{1}
x h_k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{k + 1}{2}} h_{k + 1}(x) + \sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}h_{k-1}(x),
\end{equation}
so again, for finite linear combinations of Hermite functions there is no issue.  Moreover, for any $(c_k) \in \mathfrak{L}_1$, let $f = \iota (c_k)$, and let $P_n$ be the orthogonal projection onto $\text{span} \langle h_0, h_1, \dotsc , h_n \rangle$. By (1), for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_n f$ is in the domain of the multiplication-by-$x$ operator, hereafter denoted $M_x$.  Moreover, we discern the loose bound that for $m \leq n$, $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$,
$$ \Vert M_x P_n f - M_x P_m f \Vert_{L^2}^2 \leq 2 \sum_{k = m - 1}^{n + 1} (k + 1) \vert c_k \vert^2, $$
so by $f = \iota(c_k)$ and $( \sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, we see that the sequence $( M_x P_n f)_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, hence convergent.  Obviously $P_n f \to f$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, and $M_x P_n f \to g$ for some $g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$; by closedness of $M_x$, we have that $f$ is in the domain of $M_x$ and $M_x f = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_x P_n f$.  In other words, $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$. By our convention on the Fourier transform, we have that (e.g., Folland, Real Analysis , Exercise 23h) that
\begin{equation} \tag{2}
\widehat{h}_k(s) = (-i)^k h_k(s);
\end{equation}
Hence, showing $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ follows in essentially the same way. In my attempt to show $\mathfrak{D}_1 \subseteq \iota(\mathfrak{L}_1)$, I note first that for all $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $s \widehat{f}(s) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, then $f \in \mathcal{H}^1(\mathbb{R})$, the $L^2$-Sobolev space of first order, so in particular, the distributional derivative $f^{\prime}(x)$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Since for $f \in \mathfrak{D}_1$, we also have that $x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we see that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.  If the linearity holds, then by $Tf \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, it will follow that $(\sqrt{k + 1} c_k) \in \ell^2$, and we will be done. Perhaps (probably!) it is just a mental block, but I am not as certain how the infinite limit holds in this direction.  Certainly
$$ \langle T h_j, T h_k \rangle = (k + 1) \delta_{j, k}, $$
so we have some orthogonality to work with, but I do not see the passage to infinite sums, even under the hypothesis that $f \in \mathfrak{D}(T)$.","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

Intuitively, I understand why the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is a number less than 4 and how Pi is found by inscribing and circumscribing a regular polygon with a variable number of sides and deriving Pi as a number in between the perimeters of those polygons (and that this window gets smaller after each successive step in an attempt to calculate Pi). But all intuitive explanations I've encountered sound suspiciously like taking a limit of something. For example: taking a limit as the number of the sides of a polygon approach infinity (so as it more accurately hugs the surface of a circle), treating that as the circumference and dividing it by the length of the diameter. But I also know that pi is not algebraic, so I'm not sure if I should be looking for an algebraic expression the limit of which w.r.t. a variable approaches a transcendental number.

p-1&\equiv -1\pmod{p}\\
p-2&\equiv -2\pmod{p}\\

So, we have \begin{align*}
\binom{p-1}{k}k!&=(p-1)(p-2)\cdots (p-k)\\
&\equiv (-1)(-2)\cdots (-k)\\

In fact, every Riemann surface $\Sigma$ admits an embedding $\varphi : \Sigma \to \mathbb{CP}^3$. It follows from the degree-genus formula that the same is not true if we replace $\mathbb{CP}^3$ with $\mathbb{CP}^2$; for example, no Riemann surface of genus two can be embedded in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. Said another way, there exists a compact complex manifold of dimension three into which every compact Riemann surface embeds (namely $\mathbb{CP}^3$), but the natural two-dimensional candidate (namely $\mathbb{CP}^2$) does not have this property. So my question is Is there a compact complex surface into which every compact Riemann surface embeds? The only other surface I have checked is $\mathbb{CP}^1\times\mathbb{CP}^1$. My hope was that every Riemann surface $\Sigma$ admitted an embedding $\varphi : \Sigma \to \mathbb{CP}^3$ with $\varphi(\Sigma)$ contained in the image of the Segre embedding $\mathbb{CP}^1\times\mathbb{CP}^1 \to \mathbb{CP}^3$.

1488747,Least Square Approximation for Exponential Functions,"I'm a little confused on how to approach the following problem. Use the least square method to fit a curve of the form $y=a\cdot b^x$ to a collection of $n$ data points $(x_1,y_1),...,(x_n,y_n)$ Find $a$ and $b$. From what I understand. Given data {$(x_1,y_1),...,(x_n,y_n)$}, we may define the error associated to $y=a\cdot b^x$ by
\begin{equation}
E(c,d)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-a\cdot b^{x_i})^2
\end{equation}
The goal is to find values of $a$ and $b$ that minimize the error. In multivariable calculus we learn that this requires us to find the values of $(a,b)$ such that \begin{array}
d \frac{\partial E}{\partial a}=0  & & \frac{\partial E}{\partial b}=0
\end{array} Differentiating $E(a,b)$ yields: \begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a}&=&\sum_{i=1}^n2(y_i-a\cdot b^{x_i})(-b^{x_i})=0\\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial b}&=&\sum_{i=1}^n2(y_i-a\cdot b^{x_i})(-a\cdot b^{x_i-1}x_i)=0\\
\end{eqnarray} I know that the least square method tries to minimize the error, but I can't help but feel that I doing this somewhat wrong since this isn't a polynomial - but an exponential - function. The alternative was for me to take the natural log of $y=a\cdot b^x$ to get:
\begin{equation}
\ln{y}=\ln{a}+x\ln{b}

Then defining $\ln{y}=Y$,$\ln{a}=A$ and $\ln{b}=B$ to get:

The standard proof of this theorem (due to Erdos) is one of the earliest and  arguably most important applications of the probabilistic method. One basically shows that a random graph $G_{n,p}$ (for large $n$ and carefully chosen $p$) can be modified by removing a small proportion of the vertices to obtain a graph with no short cycles and no large independent sets - hence a graph with large girth and large chromatic number. Another thing which is well known is that triangle-free graphs with large chromatic number exist. These graphs can be constructed very explicitly using a construction of Mycielski . The following question is thus very natural, and I suspect the answer is well known to many (but unfortunately not me): Does there exist an explicitly defined family $G_{k,l}$ with $\chi(G_{k,l}) \geq k$ and $\mathrm{girth}(G_{k,l}) \geq l$ ?

1489474,Convergence of measurable functions and the completion of a measure,"I am currently studying from Folland's Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications . I know the following: If $\mu$ is a complete measure, and $\{ f_{n} \}$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that $f_{n} \to f$ a.e., then $f$ is also measurable. If $(X, \mathcal{M} , \mu)$ is a measure space and $(X ,\bar{\mathcal{M}}, \bar{\mu})$ is its completion, and if $f$ is a $\bar{\mathcal{M}}$-measurable function on $X$, then there is an $\mathcal{M}$-measurable function $g$ such that $f=g$ $\bar{\mu}$- almost everywhere. Now, at the beginning of Folland's proof of the dominated convergence theorem, he argues (very briefly) that if $f_{n} \to f$ a.e., and $\{ f_{n} \}$ is a sequence in $L^{1}$, then ""$f$ is measurable (perhaps after redefinition on a null set)"", which he says follows from (1) and (2) above. What does he mean by this? And wouldn't we then be able to apply this logic to any old measurable sequence $\{ h_{n} \}$ such that $h_{n} \to h$ a.e., and claim that ""$h$ is measurable (perhaps after redefinition on a null set)"" regardless of whether the measure we use is complete?

1489645,Advantange of having a complete topology on test functions,"Let's consider $\mathscr D(\Omega)$, the space of test functions on $\Omega \neq \emptyset \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ as usually defined. For the sake of clareness, $$\mathscr D(\Omega) = \cup_K \mathscr D_K,$$ $K \subset \Omega$ compact, $\mathscr D_k := \{ f \in C^\infty(\Omega) \mbox{ with support in } K\}$. There are serveral ways to topologize $\mathscr D(\Omega)$. Among them, one is defining the family of norms $$\| \phi \|_N := \max \{ | D^\alpha \phi(x) | : x \in \Omega, | \alpha | \leq N\},$$ for $\phi \in \mathscr D(\Omega)$ and $N = 0, 1, 2, \dots$. The restrictions of these norms to any fixed $\mathscr D_K \subset \mathscr D(\Omega)$ induce the same topology on $\mathscr D_K$ as do the seminorms $p_N$ defined below: $$p_N( \phi ) := \max \{ | D^\alpha \phi(x) | : x \in K_N, | \alpha | \leq N\}.$$ Let's denote this topology with $\tau_K$. It is well known that each $(\mathscr D_K, \tau_K)$ is Fréchet. One can use norms $\| \phi \|_N$ to define a locally convex metrizable topology on $\mathscr D(\Omega)$, but this topology is not complete . Now, suppose we topologize $\mathscr D(\Omega)$ as the inductive limit of $\mathscr D_K$ (see Rudin). Denote this topology with $\tau$. Then $\mathscr D(\Omega)$ is complete ($\tau$-Cauchy sequences do converge). One shows that $(\mathscr D(\Omega), \tau)$ is not metrizable (hence can't be Fréchet). Most important, one shows also that $\mathscr D_K$ inherits from $(\mathscr D(\Omega), \tau)$ the same topology as before, and Theorem 6.5 in Rudin holds. Rudin says that having an uncomplete topology is a disadvantage. This is taken as a motivation to substitute $\tau_K$ with $\tau$. Finally, look at continuous linear functionals on $\mathscr D(\Omega)$. Functional like these exist in both cases, because in each case $\mathscr D(\Omega)$ is locally convex. Of course, we would not obtain the same set of linear functionals in the two cases, so we have different sets of distributions. Looking at the above remarks, one could think that these distributions will share a lot of properties . So my question is Question. Which is the striking advatange to having a complete topology on $\mathscr D(\Omega)$, if our goal is constructing a distribution theory which have the usual well-known properties (cfr. Rudin, beginning Chapter 6)? Please, note that answers like ""completeness it's always better"", ""in order to apply Open Mapping theorem"" or similar will not be accepted, if unsupported by a specific example which shows a ""crash"" of uncompleteness.
