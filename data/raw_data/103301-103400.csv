1445316,How to find smallest enclosing ellipse when multiple lines are given ? This ellipse needs to intersect all those lines,"I'm trying to find the smallest ellipse in terms of circumference. I suspect the smallest enclosing ellipse will intersect some lines in one single point. Given a line l: px + qy + r = 0 , L : { p  q  r } I can try to find this ellipse by using the following equation: ap 2 n + bp n q n + cq 2 n + dp n r n + eq n r n + fr 2 n = 0. Whereby n represents the number of lines. Using multiple lines I can find the values of a ... f . Later I can use the following equation K: LBL T = 0 , whereby B contains the parameters a ... f .

1445333,Ring of integers of cubic number field,"I want to show that the ring of integers of the cubic number field $K = \mathbb Q(\alpha)$ , where $\alpha$ is a root of $f = X^3 - X - 2$ , is equal to $\mathbb Z[\alpha]$ . $(1, \alpha, \alpha^2)$ forms a $\mathbb Q$ -basis of $K$ consisting of integers. I know $\mathbb Z[\alpha] \subseteq \mathcal O_K$ . To show equality, I'm guessing the following result is useful: Let $K$ be a number field of degree $n$ , $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ a $\mathbb Q$ -basis of $K$ consisting of integers. Suppose there exist $m \in \mathbb N, m > 2$ and $k_1, \dots, k_n \in \mathbb Z$ with $\gcd(m, k_1, \dots, k_n) = 1$ such that $$\frac{k_1 \alpha_1 + \dots + k_n \alpha_n}{m} \in \mathcal O_K$$ then $m^2 \,\big\vert\, \mathrm{disc}(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ . I have $\mathrm{disc}(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) = -104$ , so $m = 2$ , hence I want to show that I cannot have $$\frac{a + b \alpha + c \alpha^2}{2} \in \mathcal O_K$$ for integers $a, b, c \in \mathbb Z$ of which at least one is odd. But I'm getting stuck here. How do I show these aren't integral elements? Can anyone give me a hint on how to proceed?","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
1445367,Universal covering and double cover functors,"Cross-posted on MO Let $\mathsf{CW}$ be the category of CW-complexes and $\mathsf{CW}_*$ that of pointed CW-complexes (possibly disconnected, one basepoint in each component). I would like to know whether there is a functor $\mathsf{CW} \to \mathsf{CW}$ mapping a CW-complex to its universal cover. In the pointed case this works, i.e. there is a functor $\mathsf{CW}_* \to \mathsf{CW}_*$ mapping a pointed CW-complex $(X,x_0)$ to its universal cover 
$$ \widetilde X(x_0) \colon = \{[\alpha \colon I \to X] \mid \alpha(0)= x_0 \} $$
where square brackets denote homotopy relative endpoints, and the covering projection is $[\alpha] \mapsto \alpha(1)$. The basepoint of $\widetilde X(x_0)$ is the class of the constant map, and induced maps are given by requiring that basepoints map to basepoints, using lift uniqueness. But without the basepoint I am unable to define this as a functor. A related question (one that I am more interested in) is: define the category $\mathsf{CW}^\text{tw}$ to be the category of pairs $(X,w)$ with $X$ a CW-complex and $w \in H^1(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)$, and maps preserving cohomology classes. Is there a functor $\mathsf{CW}^\text{tw} \to \mathsf{CW}$ which maps a $(X,w)$ to a two sheeted covering space $\overline X \to X$ whose first Stiefel-Whitney class is $w$? Again, this is possible in the pointed setting, and a positive answer to the first question would imply a positive answer here as well. The second functor actually exists on the subcategory $\mathsf{MFD} < \mathsf{CW}^\text{tw}$ of smooth (actually also topological) manifolds with their first Stiefel-Whitney classes: take the sphere bundle of the top exterior algebra of the tangent bundle. This makes me think it would not be an easy task to show that they don't exist over all CW-complexes, i.e. the statement is not that implausible after all. I would be very grateful for any help, including references and hints. Thank you for reading :)","['covering-spaces', 'groupoids', 'general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'category-theory']"
1445368,Prove that ALL solutions of the differential equation y'=y are of the form y=c*e^x,"This is my first post. :) I'm learning about solving differential equations by separation of variables and I have questions about the rigourousness of the method. As stated, I'm solving $${dy\over dx} = y$$ The method that I've been taught goes like this. Case 1: Assume $y(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Check if $y(x) = 0$ is a solution. It is. Case 2: Assume $y(x) = 0$ for no $x$. We divide by $y$ on both sides to convert into separable form. This division is justified because $y \not= 0$. We get $dy/y = dx$. ""Integrating"" both sides, we get $\ln|y| = x+c$. Rearrange to isolate $y$, we get $y = \pm e^xe^c$, and realize that $\pm e^c$ is a nonzero free constant.Â $\square$ The above is the approach I've been taught. The problem is that we're missing a case. How about this? Case 3: Assume $y(x) = 0$ for some $x$. I feel that a completely rigourous solution also needs to prove that there are no solutions under this case. But I don't know how to prove it. If you possess a proof, I invite you to present your answer here. I'd be delighted to read it. I've been reading a textbook that tried to prove this but I can't fill in all the missing steps myself. It goes something like this: Suppose we're not in Case 1, so that $y(x) \not= 0$ for some $x$. Since $y$ is continuous, there is some open interval around $x$ such that $y(x) \not= 0$ for all $x$ within the interval. Then all the steps in case 2 apply within this interval. But then I don't understand why this implies that $y(x) \not= 0$ outside of the interval as well. Anyway, this is only one possible proof method and I'm open to hearing others. Ideally, I'm interested a proof method that easily generalizes to other separable differential equations as well, because dividing by $y$ or a function of $y$ is quite common during the separation process.","['analysis', 'calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1445387,Complex Analysis: Holomorphic Functions,"I am currently learning about holomorphic functions, and right after the statement about the Cauchy-Riemann equations, there is a proposition that states, ""If f is holomorphic at $z_0$, then $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial {\bar{z}}} = 0""$.

1445627,Leibniz rule for covariant derivative of tensor fields,"Let M be a differentiable manifold. I want to define the covariant derivative $\nabla$ of tensor fields over M, as a derivation on a suitable algebra A of tensors, that is: 1) $\nabla$ is linear over tensors of the same order. 2) $\nabla$ increases the covariant order of the tensor by one. 3) $\nabla$ satisfies the Leibniz rule for arbitrary tensors of the algebra A with respect to the tensor product. My issue is with point 3. In Physics, usually one defines the covariant derivative of an arbitrary tensor by extending the covariant derivatives of vectors and covectors, requiring that it commutes with contraction and that it satisfies the Leibniz rule for the components. However, I want to work with the tensors themselves instead of just the components. If I do that, then the Leibniz rule doesn't seem to work. For example, say S is of order (1,0) (covariant) and T is of order (0,1) (contravariant), and that the covariant derivative stacks the additional covariant component at the beginning of the tensor. Writting the tensors in terms of a basis $\partial_{j}$ and its natural cobasis $dx^{j}$: $$ S = S_{j}dx^{j} $$
$$ T = T^{j}\partial_{j} $$ Let $\Gamma^{i}_{j,k}$ be the connection coefficients defining the covariant derivative in that particular coordinate system. Then one would have: $$ \nabla S = \partial_{i}(S_{j}) dx^{i} \otimes dx^{j} - S_{j}\Gamma^{j}_{k,l}dx^{l} \otimes dx^{k} $$ $$ \nabla T = \partial_{i}(T^{j}) dx^{i} \otimes \partial_{j} +  T^{j}\Gamma^{k}_{j,l}dx^{l} \otimes \partial_{k} $$ But then $\nabla T \otimes S$ has summands of the form $dx^{\alpha} \otimes \partial_{\beta} \otimes dx^{\gamma}$ while $ T \otimes \nabla S$ has summands of the form $\partial_{\alpha} \otimes dx^{\beta} \otimes dx^{\gamma}$, so the two cannot be summed to form $\nabla (T \otimes S )$ unless some shuffling is applied to the factors (the total number of covariant and contravariant components is the same in both). So my question is: is there a canonical way to order the covariant and contravariant parts in a product like this, so that $\nabla$ satisfies the Leibniz rule in the way I propose?","['differential-geometry', 'tensor-products']"
1445638,How many tubes can you balance in a centrifuge?,"I recently learned that if you have a centrifuge whose number of holes $n$ is divisible by $6$, then you can balance any number of tubes except for $1$ and $n-1$. If $k$, the number of tubes you want to balance, is even, just put them in $k/2$ pairs of opposite holes. If $k$ is odd and bigger than $1$ and less than $n-1$, then you can place $3$ tubes in an equilateral triangle, leaving $n/2-3$ unoccupied pairs of holes for the remaining $(k-1)/2$ tubes. I was wondering if we could solve the problem for a general $n$. To make this more formal, let $\zeta_n$ be a primitive $n$th root of unity. We can balance $k$ tubes in a centrifuge of $n$ holes if there exists a subset of $\{1, \zeta_n,\ldots, \zeta_n^{n-1}\}$ whose sum is $0$. If $n=p$ is prime, then you can only balance $0$ or $p$ tubes, since given a nonempty proper subset of the $p$th root of unity WLOG we can choose $\zeta_p$ so that $\zeta_p^{p-1}$ is not in the subset (unless the subset is everything except $1$, which clearly doesn't sum to $0$), and the zero sum gives a nonzero polynomial in $\zeta_p$ of degree less than $p-1$, contradicting $1+x+\cdots+x^{p-1}$ being the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_p$. I've made a few more observations: in general, if $k$ and $n$ have a common factor greater than $1$, then you can balance $k$ tubes in a centrifuge with $n$ holes (just take the disjoint union of $n/k$ cyclically symmetric $k$-tuples). I suspect this is the only possibility if $n=p^m$ is a prime power (i.e., $k$ must be divisible by $p$). Furthermore, I suspect that if $n=pq$ is the product of distinct primes, then only multiples of $p$ and multiples of $q$ work: I couldn't do $k=p+q$ as a disjoint union, since if you take the $q$ roots whose powers are the multiples of $p$, then each is unique mod $q$, so any cyclically symmetric $p$-tuple will intersect with the $q$-tuple. In general, I suspect that the only way to balance tubes is to start with cyclically symmetric arrangements and take successive disjoint unions and set differences.

To address this we proceed as follows: $f\in \mathcal{S}_{\alpha_1}^{\beta_1},\: g \in \mathcal{S}_{\alpha_2}^{\beta_2}\implies$ $$\sup_x|f(x)|\exp(k_1|x|^{1/\alpha_1}) < \infty \\ \sup_x|g(x)|\exp(k_2|x|^{1/\alpha_2}) < \infty$$ Multiplying both the inequalities we have $$\sup_x|f(x)g(x)|\exp(k_1|x|^{1/\alpha_1}+k_2|x|^{1/\alpha_2}) < \infty -(1)$$
Now, $k_1|x|^{1/\alpha_1} \le k_1|x|^{\max\{1/\alpha_1,1/\alpha_2\}}$. Similarly 
$k_2|x|^{1/\alpha_2} \le k_2|x|^{\max\{1/\alpha_1,1/\alpha_2\}}$. hence $$\sup_x|f(x)g(x)|\exp(k_1|x|^{1/\alpha_1}+k_2|x|^{1/\alpha_2})\le\sup_x|f(x)g(x)|\exp(k|x|^{\max\{1/\alpha_1,1/\alpha_2\}}\:)-(2)$$ where $k=k_1+k_2$.

Say that a set of reals $X$ is computably strong measure zero (csmz) if there is an $e$ such that $\Phi_e^f$ is an $f$-cover of $X$ whenever $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. (This is sadly not the same as effective strong measure zero , a notion introduced by Kihara in his thesis; see also Higuchi and Kihara http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016800721400044X .) In computability theory, a real is said (informally) to be ""random"" if it is not in any ""simple"" measure-zero set; there are of course many ways to formalize this, but this is the basic theme. Csmz sets provide a very strong notion of non-randomness: say that an individual real $r$ is antirandom if $\{r\}$ is csmz - equivalently, if $r$ is contained in some csmz set. My question is: What are the antirandom reals? I strongly suspect that every antirandom real is computable, but I can't prove it. TECHNICAL NOTE: the set of antirandom reals is countable - this is because there is a countable set $\{A_i: i\in\omega\}$ of csmz sets such that every csmz set is contained in one of the $A_i$s, it can be forced that every strong measure zero set is countable, and antirandomness is a $\Pi^1_1$ property (so ""there are countably many antirandom reals"" is absolute assuming large cardinals).","['logic', 'real-analysis', 'computability', 'measure-theory']"
1446648,A metric space is complete when every closed and bounded subset of it is compact,"$X$ is a metric space such that every closed and bounded subset of $X$ is compact . Then $X$ is complete. Let $(x_{n})_{n}$ be a Cauchy sequence of $X$. Now every Cauchy sequence in a metric space is bounded. If $(x_{n})$ is convergent with limit, say, $x_{0}$, then $\{x_{n} : n \}\cup \{x_{0}\}$ is closed, otherwise the set $\{x_{n} : n \}$ is a closed set. If the sequence was convergent there was nothing to do. So when the sequence's convergent is not known, being closed and bounded, $\{x_{n} : n \}$ is a compact set. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness. Hence, the sequence $(x_{n})_n$ has a convergence subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})_k$ converging to, say, $x_{0}$. For being Cauchy, $(x_{n}$ also converges to $x_{0}$. Thus we see that every Cauchy sequence in $X$ is convergent . Hence $X$ is complete. Is my proof correct? For I have doubts regarding the step where I assumed that the range of the sequence, i.e. $\{x_{n} : n \}$ is closed. This would be true if I were in $\mathbb R$ but can this be assured for an arbitrary metric space? Or does that step require modification in some other respect?","['metric-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"

$$P=\left(I-e_1e_1^T,I-e_2e_2^T,I-e_3e_3^T \right)$$ I can write the identity matrix as the following:
$$I = \frac{1}{2} \left(P_1+P_2+P_3 \right) $$ Now the condition in order for my 3x3 matrix, A, to be semidefinite is:
$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TAx \ge0$$ Inserting the identity matrix on both sides: $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TAx=x^TIAIx \ge0$$ and expanding out my definition of the identity. $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TAx=\frac{1}{4}x^T\left(P_1+P_2+P_3 \right)A\left(P_1+P_2+P_3 \right)x \ge0$$ Expanding the product we get: $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TP_1AP_1x+x^TP_1AP_2x+x^TP_1AP_3x+x^TP_2AP_1x+x^TP_2AP_2x+x^TP_2AP_3x+x^TP_3AP_1x+x^TP_3AP_2x+x^TP_3AP_3x\ge0$$ Exploiting the hermiticity of A and the projection matrices we can rewrite the above as: $$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TP_1AP_1x+2x^TP_1AP_2x+2x^TP_1AP_3x+x^TP_2AP_2x+2x^TP_2AP_3x+x^TP_3AP_3x\ge0$$ Now I believe that through the various projections each term in this sum can be independently varied with particular choices in the variation of X.  Since each term in the sum is independent of the others, the inequality distributes over each term in the sum. $$\leftrightarrow \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^3:x^TP_1AP_1x \ge0 \cap x^TP_1AP_2x \ge0 \cap x^TP_1AP_3x \ge0 \cap x^TP_2AP_2x \ge0 \cap x^TP_2AP_3x \ge0 \cap  x^TP_3AP_3x \ge0$$ Since each term above is a 3x3 matrix with a 2x2 submatrix and the rest of the entries zero, this implies that every 2x2 submatrix of A is positive semidefinite if and only if A is positive semidefinite.

1446797,Finding the number of non-decreasing sequences.,"A sequence is non-decreasing if $k_1 \leq k_2 \leq k_3$. Now I need to  find the number of non-decreasing sequences of length-$n$ sequences from $\{1,2,....m\}$ I basically see it as sum of the numbers of strictly increasing sequences plus other sequences. The number of strictly increasing sequences of length $n$ is ${m \choose n}$ because simply any subset of length $n$ can be arranged to be form exactly one strictly increasing sequence. However, we don't have repetition of digits when we deal with strictly increasing sequences unlike non-decreasing sequences. Ok to make sense of it, I choose $n=3,m=4$ So Now I am looking at the non-decreasing sequences of length $3$ from $\{1,2,3,4\}$ We have $$\{1,1,1\},\{2,2,2\},\{3,3,3\},\{4,4,4\}$$ This is all the non-decreasing sequences that consists of only one digit and  there are $m$ digits of them as we see which can also be represented as ${m \choose 1}$ Now one can choose $$\{1,1,2\},\{1,1,3\},\{1,1,4\},\{1,2,2\},\{1,3,3\},\{1,4,4\},\{2,2,3\},\{2,2,4\},\{2,3,3\},\{2,4,4\},\{3,3,4\}$$ Now this is the non-decreasing sequences of length $3$ but that has exactly two digits. In total they are 11 such sequences But what equation is that ? I want to build a pattern here to arrive to my answer and hopefully generalize it. Because after this we have the case of non-decreasing sequence of $3$ digits which is basically the same number as the strictly increasing sequences which is ${m \choose n} = {4 \choose 3} = 4$ and then we add everything together, So I guess there must be a summation formula which answers this question. So the answer for the special case when $n=3,m=4$ should be ${4

Why is boundedness crucial? Let's step through a possible proof: Let $$\mathcal D:=\left\{A\subseteq\Omega:1_A\in\mathcal H\right\}\;.$$ Claim : $\mathcal H$ is a $\lambda$-system Proof : $\Omega\in\mathcal M$ and (1.) $\Rightarrow$ $\Omega\in\mathcal D$ Let $A\in\mathcal D\Rightarrow 1_{A^c}=1_\Omega-1_A\in\mathcal H$ by (1.) and (2.)$\Rightarrow A^c\in\mathcal D$ Let $\left\{A_n\right\}\subseteq\mathcal D$ be pairwise disjoint, then $$1_{A^n}=\sum_{m\le n}1_{A_m}\in\mathcal H\;,$$ for $A^n:=\biguplus_{m\le n}A_m$, by (2.) and therefore $$1_A=\lim_{n\to\infty}1_{A^n}\in\mathcal H$$ by (3.) (since $1_A$ is bounded) Now, since $\mathcal M$ is a $\pi$-system, $$\sigma(\mathcal M)=\delta(\mathcal M)\subseteq\mathcal D\;,$$
by (1.) and the $\pi$-$\lambda$-theorem . So, by (2.), all simple $\sigma(\mathcal M)$-measurable functions are contained in $\mathcal H$. Until now, the whole argumentation has not made use of the boundedness restriction in (3.). Let $f:\Omega\to\mathbb R$ be $\sigma(\mathcal M)$-measurable. Then, it's positive and negative parts $f^+$ and $f^-$ can be written as the monotone limit of non-negative $\sigma(\mathcal M)$-measurable simple functions $f_n^+$ and $f_n^-$, respectively. Since $f_n^\pm\in\mathcal H$, we can conclude $$f=f^+-f^-=\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n^+-\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n^-\in\mathcal H\;,\tag{1}$$ even without the boundedness restriction in (3.) as long as the pointwise limits exist (in $\overline{\mathbb R}$). In the sense of existence in $\overline{\mathbb R}$, the limits exist as long there sum is well-defined, i.e. as long as there can't be a $\infty+(-\infty)$ term. So, it seems like we could loosen the boundedness in (3.) and only force $$\inf_\Omega f>-\infty\;.$$ Do I miss something?","['probability-theory', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1447284,Elegant way to show that N is a normal subgroup of G,"Claim : Let $G$ be the set of all real $2 \times 2$ matrices $\left( \begin{array}{cc}

1 & b_1 \\
0 & 1

1 & b_2 \\

1447312,Analytic function defined in the punctured unit disk real in the unit circle then $f(z)=\overline{f(1/\overline{z})}$,"This is a follow up to a question I asked a few days ago. I initially thought I understood the solution to the problem, but there's something I can't quite grasp: Let $f$ be analytic in the set $\{ x \in \mathbb{C} : 0<|z|<1\}$. If $f$ is real in the unit circle $\{z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|=1\}$, and has a continuous extension to the unit circle, then show that: $$f(z)=\overline{f\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}} \right )} \ \forall z\in \mathbb{C}$$ My approach was as follows : Let $\phi: \mathbb{C}\setminus\{-i\} \to \mathbb{C}\setminus \{1\}$ be given by $$\phi(z)=\frac{z-i}{z+i}$$ It is easy to prove that $\phi$ maps the upper half plane into the unit disk, this is $\phi (\mathbb{C}^+)= D$ and that it maps the real axis into the unit circle, i.e.  $|\phi(x)|=1$ for real $x$. Note that $\phi^{-1}:\mathbb{C}\setminus \{1\} \to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{-i\}$ is given by: $$\phi^{-1}(z)=i\frac{z+1}{1-z}$$ Also note that \begin{equation}\overline{\phi^{-1}(z)}=\phi^{-1}\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}}\right )\tag1\end{equation} Now, by the preceding remarks, the composition $g=f\circ \phi : \overline{\mathbb{C}^+}\setminus\{i\} \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous in its domain and analytic in $\mathbb{C}^+ \setminus\{i\}$. Further, since $g(\mathbb{R})\subset \mathbb{R}$, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $g$ to $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{i,-i\}$, that is the function $h:\mathbb{C}\setminus\{i,-i\} \to \mathbb{C}$ given by: $$h(z)=\begin{cases}g(z)=(f\circ \phi)(z) & \textrm{if}  \ z \in \overline{\mathbb{C}^+}\setminus\{i\} \\\overline{g(\overline{z})}=\overline{(f\circ \phi)(\overline {z})} & \textrm{if} \ z \in \overline{\mathbb{C}^-}\setminus\{-i\}
\end{cases}\tag2$$ is analytic in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{i,-i\}$ and verifies $h(z)=\overline{h(\overline{z})}$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}\setminus \{i,-i\}$. Now, if we take $z\neq i,-i$, from $(1)$ and the fact that $h(z)=\overline{h(\overline{z})}$ we get that: \begin{equation}f(z)=(f\circ \phi)(\phi^{-1}(z))=h(\phi^{-1}(z))=\overline{h(\overline{\phi^{-1}(z)})}=\overline{h\left ( \phi^{-1}\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}}\right ) \right )}=\overline{f\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}} \right )}\tag3\end{equation} Which would complete the proof (the cases $z=i,-i$ are easily handled separately since the function is real in the unit circle). My question is: In $(3)$, why does $h\circ \phi^{-1}=f$ (this is used in the second and final equalities). If $\phi^{-1}(z) \in \overline{\mathbb{C}^+}\setminus\{i\}$, then in is clear from $(2)$ that $h(\phi^{-1}(z))=(f\circ \phi)(\phi^{-1}(z))=f(z)$, since this is the definition of $h$ in that region, but what if $\phi^{-1}(z) \in \overline{\mathbb{C}^-}\setminus\{-i\}$? Using $(2)$ and some other identities we already know I can get: $$h(\phi^{-1}(z))=\overline{(f\circ \phi)(\overline {\phi^{-1}z})}=\overline{(f\circ \phi)\left ( \phi^{-1}\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}} \right )\right )}=\overline{f\left ( \frac{1}{\overline{z}}\right )}$$ Alternatively: $$h(\phi^{-1}(z))=\overline{h(\overline{\phi^{-1}(z)})}=\overline{h\left ( \phi^{-1}\left (\frac{1}{\overline z} \right ) \right )}$$ Both paths seemingly lead nowhere, and the argument becomes almost circular.

1447489,Functional equation of the Hurwitz Zeta function and a certain harmonic sum.,"Introduction. The purpose here is to motivate the reader to study Mellin transforms and their applications in the evaluation of harmonic sums as well as verify and perhaps improve a certain application of the method. Mellin transform manipulation is a very useful skill to have especially in number theory or computer science. Problem statement. Inspired by the computations at this MSE link I and this MSE link II we introduce the harmonic sum 
$$ S(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} 
\frac{1}{\cosh((2k+1)x)}.$$ Use the Mellin transform
$$\mathfrak{M}\left(\frac{1}{\cosh(x)}; s\right)$$
and the functional equation of the Hurwitz Zeta function to establish a functional equation for $S(x).$
Evaluate $$S(\pi/2)$$ making use of a special property of the functional equation, which is simpler than the ones at this MSE link III but requires proof just the same. Remark. We do ask that the details of the calculation be included as they are relevant to an understanding of the process and in the present case include a remarkable eureka moment.","['sequences-and-series', 'mellin-transform']"
