69086,Baseball betting and probablity,"Here is a question that came up during class discussions on Friday: Your favorite baseball team is playing against your uncle's favorite team in the 
World Series. At the beginning of each game, you and your uncle bet on the game's outcome. Your uncle, being wealthy and carefree, always lets you choose the amount of the bet. If you bet b dollars and your team wins the game, your uncle gives you an IOU for b dollars. But if they lose the game, you give him an IOU for b dollars. When the series is over, all outstanding IOUs are settled in cash. You would like to walk away with 100 in cash if your team wins the series, and lose 100 if your team loses the series. How much should you bet on the opening game? (For non-baseball fans, the first team to win a total of four games 
wins the series). I am thinking to apply probability. For example, knowing 100 is the result, moving backward but not exactly sure how to proceed.","['finance', 'probability']"
69090,challenging alternating infinite series involving $\ln$,"I ran across an infinite series that is allegedly from a Chinese math contest. Evaluate: $\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\ln\left(1-\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\right).$ I thought perhaps this telescoped in some fashion.  So, I wrote out $\ln(1/2)-\ln(5/6)+\ln(11/12)-\ln(19/20)+\ln(29/30)-..............$ Separated the positive and negative using log properties: $\ln(1/2)+\ln(11/12)+\ln(29/30)+......=\ln(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{11}{12}\cdot \frac{29}{30}\cdot\cdot\cdot)$ $-(\ln(5/6)+\ln(19/20)+\ln(41/42)+......=-\ln(\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{19}{20}\cdot \frac{41}{42}\cdot\cdot\cdot) $ $\ln(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{11}{12}\cdot \frac{29}{30}\cdot\cdot\cdot)-\ln(\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{19}{20}\cdot \frac{41}{42}\cdot\cdot\cdot)$ $=\displaystyle \ln\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{11}{12}\cdot \frac{29}{30}\cdot\cdot\cdot}{\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{19}{20}\cdot \frac{41}{42}\cdot\cdot\cdot}\right)$ Maybe come up with a general term at the end of the partial sum? The terms in the numerator are $n=2,4,6,....$ and those in the denominator are $n=3,5,7,.....$ $\frac{N(N-1)-1}{N(N-1)}$.  But, I always end up with a limit of 1. This then gives $\ln(1)=0$. The series does converge.  I managed to do some cancellations, but failed to wrap it up. I thought maybe I was onto something. I suppose I am and not seeing it.  What would be a good plan of attack for this one? Since it was in a contest, I assume it can be done. Any thoughts? Thanks very much.","['logarithms', 'sequences-and-series']"

From page 10 of this article , it seems to me that: $$\frac{1}{2}\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|p_Z(x)-p_Y(x)|dx\right)^2 \leq D(p_Z\|p_Y)$$ I have two questions: 1) How does this come about?  The LHS is somehow related to total variation distance, which is $\sup\left\{|\int_A f_X(x)dx-\int_A f_Y(x)dx|:A \subset \mathbb{R}\right\}$ according to wikipedia article , but I don't see a connection.  Can someone elucidate? 2) Section 6 on page 10 of the same article seems to talk about variation bounds, but I can't understand it...

69192,Showing that $[\mathbb C(z):\mathbb C(f_0)]=$topological degree of $f_0\in\mathbb C(z)$ as a function from the Riemann sphere to itself,"McKean & Moll offer the following sketch of a proof. Let $P(x)=a_0(x)-f_0b_0(x)$ in $\mathbb C(f_0)[x]$ where $f_0(z)=\dfrac{a_0(z)}{b_0(z)}$ is in $\mathbb C(z)$ . Then evidently, $\deg P=\#$ poles of $f_0=$ topological degree of $f_0$ as it extends to a map from $\mathbb P^1\to\mathbb P^1$ . Hence, $d=[\mathbb C(z):\mathbb C(f_0)]\leq\deg P=$ topological degree of $f_0$ .
On the other hand, let $P_0=x^d+s_1x^{d-1}+\dots s_d$ be the minimal polynomial of $z$ over $\mathbb C(f_0)$ . Clearly (or it is not hard to check that) only finitely many $c\in\mathbb C$ are poles of some $s_i$ or such that $f(z)=c$ has repeated roots. So far so good, but then comes the claim I can't prove. Claim. If $f(z)=c$ has only simple roots (and so $d_0=$ topological degree of $f_0$ of them), then $x^d+s_1(c)x^{d-1}+\dots s_d(c)$ vanishes on each of those simple roots (where $s_i(c)$ is the image of $s_i$ under the map that takes $f_0\to c$ in $\mathbb C(f_0)$ ; the $s_i$ being rational functions of $f_0$ ). I see why wherever $x^d+s_1(c)x^{d-1}+\dots s_d(c)$ , we have a root of $f(z)=c$ , but I don't see what the converse would follow from at all. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.","['galois-theory', 'complex-analysis']"

69199,How can I verify the Pythagorean Trig Identity using approximations for $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ derived from their infinite series representations?,"How can I verify the Pythagorean Trig Identity using approximations for $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ derived from their infinite series representations? I can see that the infinite series of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ should mean that for small angles, $\sin x$ is approximately $x$, and $\cos x$ is approximately $1-.5x^2$.  I'd like to use these approximations to verify that $\sin^2x + \cos^2x$ is approximately $1$. I seem to be off on the wrong track with my approach to this task.  First, I simply substituted the approximations derived from the first (or first and second) terms of the series into the Pythagorean identity.  Perhaps my algebra is off, but two attempts yielded the result $x^4 = 0$ which fails to confirm either the Pythagorean identity or the approximations.  Of course, we know intuitively the results should verify truly. Can you please suggest an appropriate way to approach this? Added: I see from the answers below, that I should not have set the substitution in the Pythagorean Trig Identity equal to 1, because that very value of 1 is what I am verifying.  Instead, the Pythagorean Trig Identity should be calculated using the approximation substitutions, then compared to the value of 1.  If they are approximately close, the verification is done, and the Pythagorean Trig Identity is indeed approximately equal to 1.","['sequences-and-series', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"
69202,"Is a Fréchet differentiable map between complex Banach spaces locally given by a ""power series""?","Let $X,Y$ be Banach spaces over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $U \subset X$ be open. If $f:U \to Y$ is Fréchet differentiable at every point of $U$, can we locally expand $f$ as a ""power series""? To be more precise (and I hope I'm making this precise in the right way), given $x \in U$ must there exist $A_0,A_1,A_2,\ldots$ with $A_n$ a bounded, symmetric $n$-linear map $X^n \to Y$ such that the expansion
$$ f(y) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty A_n (y-x)^n $$
is valid for all $y$ in some neighbourhood of $x$? To explain the above notation: Let $X^0 := \mathbb{C}$ by definition so that $A_0$ is essentially an element of $Y$ (namely $f(x)$). Let $(y-x)^n : = (y-x,y-x,\ldots,y-x) \in X^n$ for $n \geq 1$ and let $(y-x)^0 := 1 \in \mathbb{C}$. Wikipedia's entry on infinite dimensional holomorphy seems to indicate the answer is yes. I found it pretty incredible that a classical result should hold at this level of generality so I checked out the reference they give which is Kadison & Ringrose Fundamentals of the theory of operator algebras, vol. 1, sect. 3.3 but it turns out that only the case $X = \mathbb{C}$ is treated — pretty unsatisfactory!

where $a=(a_k)$, $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. In the book by Hagen, Roch and Silbermann you can find the conditions when this operator is invertible in $\ell_2$, theorem 1.31, in page 48. My question is whether there similar conditions for existence of invertibility in space $\ell_1$? The condition in the book is the following. Denote $\mathbb{T}$ the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$. Let $a\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ and let $$a_k=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}a(e^{i\theta})e^{-ik\theta}d\theta$$ Theorem. 1.31 (Coburn's theorem) Let $a\in C(\mathbb{T})$. Operator $T(a)$ is invertible in $\ell_2$ if and only if $0\notin a(\mathbb{T})$ and if $\mathrm{wind}\text{ }a(\mathbb{T})=0$. Here $\mathrm{wind}\text{ }a(\mathbb{T})$ is a winding number of the curve $a(\mathbb{T})$, provided with the orientation inherited by the usual counter-clockwise orientation of the unit circle, around the origin.

69241,Examples: invariant events,"In a couple of books I'm reading chapters devoted to the Ergodic theory. As a setting: $(\Omega,\mathcal F,\mathsf P)$ is a probability space, $X:(\Omega,\mathcal F)\to (S,\mathcal S)$ is random element and $\varphi:(\Omega,\mathcal F)\to (\Omega,\mathcal F)$ is a measure-preserving map, i.e. for any $A\in \mathcal F$ it holds that $$\mathsf P(\varphi^{-1} A) = \mathsf P(A).$$ The event is called invariant if $\mathsf P((\varphi^{-1}A)\Delta A) = 0$. I am interested in some examples for such events since books I'm reading have a very few of them. If we put $X_n(\omega) = X(\varphi^n \omega)$ then we obtain a stochastic process on $S$. By the way, is it true that $X$ is always a stationary Markov process? An event $$
A = \{X_n\in B\text{ infinitely often}\}
$$ 
is invariant as well as its complement
$$
A^c = \{\text{ there exists }N \text{ such that } X_n \in B^c \text{ for all }n\geq N\}.
$$ Moreover, all invariant events form a $\sigma$-algebra and if $X$ is Markov then its invariant event are characterized by its harmonic functions. However, these characterization are quite elusive, so for me it is difficult to imagine other invariant events based on such characterization. I would be also grateful if you can refer me to a book/lecture notes where such examples are provided.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'ergodic-theory']"

Seemingly, it is well known but I don't know how to prove that. I am interested in the cases $\mathcal{B}(E)$ ($E$ - some infinite dimensional Banach space; excluding  the Argyros-Haydon space $E$ - in that case $\mathcal{B}(E)$ is separable, thus admits such a renorming) or $\mathcal{M}$ - a von Neumann algebra as well.","['banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'von-neumann-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

69245,Transform uniform distribution to normal distribution using Lindeberg–Lévy CLT,"Currently i am developing a game which is based on many computations of random values and therefore i have implemented many algorithms like the Mersenne-Twister etc. Unfortunately, all generators return uniformly distributed values and i want to modify this to make the min/max (and their surrounding) values rarer than the other ones. Researches brought me up to the point that i have been using now the Lindeberg–Lévy Central Limit Theorem : Theorem . Suppose {$X_i$} is a sequence of iid random variables with $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $Var[X_i] = \sigma^2$. Let $S_n=\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+\ldots+X_n)$. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variable $\sqrt{n}(S_n − \mu)$ converges in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$:
  $$\sqrt{n}\cdot\left(\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^nX_i\right)-\mu\right)\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$ My C++ code works fine... however the median is set to 0 and i want to know how i can change the median and the range in combination to get e.g. values from $[1;100]$ as a result will have the property, that the median ones (50 and surrounding) will have a higher probability to be returned than [1;5] or [96;100]. (Hope you understand what i am thinking right now!) Concrete example Throwing 10.000 ""unfair"" dice currently leads to this distribution: (8836,729,341,86,8,1) however i want something that looks like this: (18,341,4418,4568,341,56) Current algorithm (old one based on the theorem!) n <- 32;
    S <- 0.0;
    for i = 0 to n
        S <- S + mersenneTwister(min, max)
    S <- S / n
    µ <- (min + max) / 2.0
    randval <- sqrt(n) * (S - µ)
    return max(min, floor(randval) mod max) It seems to me, that something it not implemented correctly... Solution (i am not yet able to answer my own questions...) Finally i have found a very simple solution which suits my needs and is no overkill at all. Marsaglia polar method (more information here ) Generate two iid random values $u_1$ and $u_2$ in [-1;1]. Compute $q = u_1^2 + u_2^2$. In case that $q=0$ or $q > 1$ return to step 1. Compute $p=\sqrt{-2\cdot \ln(q) / q}$. $x_{1/2} = u_{1/2}\cdot p$ represent two independant normal distributed random numbers. If $x\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, then $a\cdot x+b\sim\mathcal{N}(b,a^2)$. Exactly what i need! For throwing my dice i let $a=1$ and $b=\mu=(min+max)/2$. @cardinal: Thanks for this idea!","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'limits']"
69263,"Proper, smooth action with singular orbit space","This is a problem from Lee, Smooth Manifolds (Problem 9.4). It's not an homework problem, I'm just systematically solving every problem of that book, and I got stuck on this one. Usually I try not to ask for help unless I really don't have a clue, but I suspect that this problem is really simple, and it's getting on my nerves. ""Give an example of smooth, proper action of a Lie group on a smooth manifold such that the orbit space is not a topological manifold"" Since the action is assumed to be proper, the orbit space is indeed Hausdorff (and also second countable, of course). Then, the only thing that can go wrong is the orbit space not being locally Euclidean. Therefore, I was trying to devise smooth action of some group on $\mathbb{R}^2$, whose orbit space is the ""cross-shaped"" set. However, I can't figure out any concrete example. In particular, in the examples I've figured out so far, the action turns out to be not proper. A compact group would do the trick. Perhaps, since there may be some confusion, it's better to provide my (Lee's) definition of proper action. Let $G$ a Lie Group acting on a smooth manifold $M$. The action is proper if the map $G\times M \to M\times M$ given by $(g,p)\to (p,g\cdot p)$ is a proper map. Equivalently, the action is proper iff the following condition is satisfied: ""If $\{p_i\}$ is a convergent sequence in $M$ and $\{g_i\}$ is a sequence in $G$ such that $\{g_i \cdot p_i\}$ converges, then a subsequence of $\{g_i\}$ converges"".","['lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

From what I can see in the identity: a is subset of n ; k is subset of a ; b is subset of n ; k is subset of b Here is what I think the combinatorial proof should be (using the committee forming method): We have a total of n people. We want to form 2 teams: Team 1 and Team 2, containing a and b number of people, respectively. And elect a total of k people as leaders of the 2 teams. there are 2 different ways of forming such sets. Out of n , choose the number of people to be in team 1.
  $\binom{n}{a}$ ways of doing this. Then we choose to select all the k leaders out of team 1. $\binom{a}{k}$ ways of doing this. Out of
  the remaining people, select the total number of people to be in team
  2. We have already selected a people out of n , and already
  selected all the k leaders, hence $\binom{n-a}{b-k}$ ways of doing
  this. Out of n total people, chose all the people to be in team 2.
  $\binom{n}{b}$ ways of doing this. Then we choose to elect all the k leaders from team 2. $\binom{b}{k}$ ways of doing this. Out of the
  remaining ( n-b ) people, we need to select the people to be in team
  1, but since all the leaders are taken from team 2 already, we have
  $\binom{n-b}{a-k}$ ways of doing this. What do you guys think? Most of it makes sense to me, although I am really not sure if I am doing the $\binom{n-a}{b-k}$ and $\binom{n-b}{a-k}$ parts right in each side of the equation.","['combinatorial-proofs', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

69337,How do I apply a digital filter to points on a sphere,"Given a set of points on a sphere, how can I implement a higher order low pass filter on them? At the moment, I am just multiplying the vectors from the input and output set by their weights and summing them, component-wise. While this works well when the angles are small, the filter response isn't right as the angles get larger than 30 degrees. It needs to perfectly compliment the response of a high pass filtered gyroscope, which works with angles, not vectors. What I'm essentially looking for is an interpolation method for multiple (in my case 8) weighted points on a sphere. The sum of all weights is one. The algorithm needs to be such, that if it were applied to only two vectors $a$ and $b$, with the weights $(1 - t)$ and $(t)$ respectively, a constant rate of change in t would result in a constant angular rate of change in the output. Say, for example we had as our two vectors $a = (1, 0, 0)$ and $b = (0, 1, 0)$, the angle ab is 90 degrees. If we set $t$ to $1/3$, we should expect the result, $c$, to be 30 degrees away from $a$. If we use the standard vector multiplication rules to calculate $c$ as $a*(1 - t) + b*t$, the angle between $a$ and $c$ is closer to 22 degrees. This error gets worse as the angle $ab$ increases. I know that the slerp algorithm exists for just two points, but I need one that works on any number of points. The problem is that standard linear interpolation between points on a sphere represented as vectors, does not interpolate correctly when you look at the angles.","['geometry', 'computational-geometry', 'spherical-geometry']"

These are in any order, and you can have as many repeats as you want (e.g. all $16$ numbers can be zero, or all the numbers can be nine). Prove that we can always chose consecutive numbers from these 16 numbers such that their product forms a square number. The conditions are that we must chose at least one number, and the numbers chosen must be consecutive (i.e. next to each other in the string of 16 numbers). I think I should use the Pigeonhole principle here. Here are a few ideas I had about approaching this: There are a total of $10^{16}$ ways of forming a string of length 16, with numbers from 0-9. These can possibly be the pigeonholes . I was thinking the pigeons should be something like the number of strings which have consecutive numbers such that their product form a square number. The largest possible square number we can have is when all 16 digits are 9, and we pick all 16 digits (we can pick less than this, for example 9 and 9). Hence, we will form the square number $9^{16}= 1853020188851841 (= 43046721^2)$. We know that every natural number has a unique prime factorisation. Hence all square numbers have unique factorisations. Between $0$-$9$, we have $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ as prime numbers. From these prime numbers, we can form any square number. From any natural number $x$, we can get to a square number, by taking the prime factorisation of $x$, and turning any odd powers into even powers. Ok, I pretty much threw in the kitchen sink.

In ""Elementary Theory of Analytic Functions of One or Several Complex Variables"" by Henri Cartan, it seems that a topology is uniquely determined in C(D), the vector space of continuous complex-valued functions in the open set D, by a fundamental system of neighborhoods. The fundamental system of neighborhoods of o is defined as follows: For any pair $(K,\epsilon)$ consisting of a compact subset $K \subset D$ and a number $\epsilon > 0$, we consider the subset $V(K,\epsilon)$ of C(D) defined by $$f \in V(K,\epsilon) \Leftrightarrow |f(x)|\leq \epsilon, \; x \in K. $$ The neighborhoods of a point f are defined by translating the neighborhoods of o by f.

C(D) has indeed a topology (invariant under translation) in which the sets $V(K,\epsilon)$ form a fundamental system of neighborhoods of o. This topology is unique and can be defined by a distance which is invariant under translation. Proof. 
The uniqueness of the topology is obvious, because we know a fundamental system of neighborhoods of o, and ...

  where $c_1,c_2$ are positive constants, $n$ is a positive variable. It says that We can make the right-hand inequality hold for any value of $n \geq 1$ by
  choosing any constant $c_2 \geq \frac{1}{2}$. But if I start to work with the right hand side, I end up with $c_2\lt\frac{1}{2}$. Does the book have a typo or am I wrong? I also have different result for the left-hand side inequality but I leave it out. UPDATE (after comments): $$\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{n}\leq c_2 &\Longleftrightarrow \frac{n}{2}-3 \leq nc_2\\

$S$ of symbols. We assume $S$ to be finite, and $\mathbb{N}$ to contain 0. If $\Sigma(f) = n$ we say that $f$ has arity $n$. We call symbols with arity 0 constants . Here are some examples of signatures. $\Sigma_G$, the signature of groups, is based on symbols $+, -$
  and $0$ with the following arities.  $\Sigma_G(+) = 2$, $\Sigma_G(-)                                           
  = 1$, and $\Sigma_G(e) = 0$. $\Sigma_L$, the signature of bounded lattices, has symbols
  $\vee$, $\wedge$, $0$ and $1$, with arities
  $\Sigma_L(\vee) = 2$, $\Sigma_L(\wedge) = 2$, $\Sigma_L(0) = 0$ and
  $\Sigma_L(1) = 0$. $\Sigma_F$, the signature of fields, has symbols $+, -, 0, \cdot,                                          
  ^{-1}$ and $1$, with arities $\Sigma_F(+) = 2$,
  $\Sigma_F(\cdot) = 2$, $\Sigma_F(-) = 1$, and $\Sigma_F(-) = 1$,
  $\Sigma_F(0) = 0$ and $\Sigma_F(1) = 0$. The term-algebra over a variable set $X$ is denoted
$\Sigma(X)$.  It is generated inductively by the following rules. If $x \in X$, then $x$ is a member of $\Sigma(X)$. If $f \in \Sigma(n)$ and $t_1, ..., t_n \in \Sigma(X)$, then
  also $f(t_1, ..., t_n) \in \Sigma(X)$. Examples of terms in the term algebra $\Sigma_G(\{x, y, z\})$ of
groups include $-(x+(y + z))$ and $-0$. These are also terms of
$\Sigma_F(\{x, y, z\})$. The term $0 \wedge (1 \vee 0)$ is in
$\Sigma_L(\emptyset)$. We can define the usual notion of size of terms as follows.
$$
  	\mathsf{size}(f(t_1, ..., t_n)) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n \mathsf{size}(t_i)
            \qquad\qquad
         \mathsf{size}(c) = 1
$$
Here $c$ ranges over the constants in $\Sigma$, and $f \in \Sigma(n)$. With this notion of size, $0 \wedge (1 \vee 0)$ for example has size 5, while $-0$ has size 2. Now we can ask questions like: how many elements of size $n$ does the term algebra $\Sigma(\emptyset)$ contain? Consider a signature $\Sigma$ with symbols $\{+, 0\}$ such that
$\Sigma(+) = 2$ and $\Sigma(0) = 0$. Let $C'_n$ be the number of terms
in $\Sigma(\emptyset)$ of size $n$. The sequence $C'_n$ begins as follows.
$$

$$
The non-zero subsequence corresponds exactly to the Catalan numbers $C_n$ that are defined by the following recursive equation.
$$
        C_0 = 1
            \qquad\qquad
        C_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_i C_{n-i}
$$ The sequence of numbers of terms

For every strictly increasing $f(n)$, consider instead the question for $g(f(n))$, which is a uniformly random integer in the range $(0.99f(n),1.01f(n))$ say, alternatively $(f(n)-1000,f(n)+1000)$. Then im looking for asymptotics of $LCM[g(f(1)),g(f(2))...g(f(x))]$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$, given $f(n)$.","['prime-numbers', 'asymptotics', 'number-theory']"
69835,Understanding direct sum of matrices,"I read the definition of direct sum on wikipedia , and got the idea that a direct sum of two matrices is a block diagonal matrix. However this does not help me understand this statement in a book. In the book I am reading, the matrix $$
\begin{pmatrix}
0&0&0&1 \\
0&0&1&0 \\
0&1&0&0 \\
1&0&0&0
\end{pmatrix}
$$ ""can be regarded as the direct sum of two submatrices"": $$
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\
1&0 
\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\
1&0 
\end{pmatrix}$$ Where onen lies in the first and fourth rows (columns) and the other in the second and third. According to the definition it should be $$
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1&0&0 \\
1&0&0&0 \\
0&0&0&1 \\
0&0&1&0
\end{pmatrix}
$$ This was taken from a problem in Problems and Solutions in Group Theory for Physicists by Zhong-Qi Ma and Xiao-Yan Gu. Here's the problem and the solution in full. Problem 3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix $R$
  $$
R = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0&0&0&1 \\
0&0&1&0 \\
0&1&0&0 \\
1&0&0&0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$ Solution. $R$ can be regarded as the direct sum of the two submatrices $\sigma_1$, one lies in the first and fourth rows(columns), the other in the second and third rows(columns). From the result of Problem 2, two eigenvalues of $R$ are $1$, the remaining two are $-1$. The relative eigenvalues are as follows:
  $$
1:  
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\ \ \ \ \ \ 
-1:
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\ 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
$$ Problem 2 refers to an earlier problem that calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix 
$$
\sigma_1=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\
1&0
\end{pmatrix}.

69848,What books are prerequisites for Spivak's Calculus?,"For financial reasons, I dropped out my senior year of college as a piano performance major. I will be returning to college to dual major in mathematics and computer science. I've taught myself to program out of SICP and would like to develop my mathematical chops. I got a 5 on the Calc BC test my junior year of high school and have always considered myself decent at math. I prefer learning from rigorous material, so Spivak's Calculus seemed to be a logical choice. I made it through the first chapter, but was blindsided by the difficulty of the first chapter's problems. Question 1. So, after solving a few problems, I put Spivak aside and picked up How to Prove It to brush up my proof writing skills. I've long ways away from finishing that, but what prerequisite material is recommended for Spivak? I remember feeling similarly overwhelmed when starting ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" however, there's a lot of supplementary information available for that book and I now feel I mastered that material. ""Helper"" material for Spivak seems sparse (excepting the solutions manual). Question 2. Does anyone know of any video lectures that cover Spivak? To my uninformed mind, Spivak seemed like a good way to ""brush up"" on Calculus while improving my general math skills. Obviously, I horribly underestimated its difficulty.","['calculus', 'reference-request', 'analysis']"
