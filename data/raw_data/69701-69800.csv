847269,Isomorphism between Ext groups in Huybrechts and Lehn's book Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Sheaves,"On p.46 (or p. 43 in the 1st edition) of Huybrechts and Lehn book Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Sheaves , 2nd ed.,  they write: Since $K$ is $A$-flat  and $I \otimes_k F_0$ is annilated by $m_A$, there is a natural isomorphism $$\mathrm{Ext}^1_{X_A}(K, I \otimes_k F_0) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1_{X_s}(K_0, F_0) \otimes_k I.$$ I don't understand how they are getting this isomorphism and I was hoping someone can explain why (I bet it is fairly easy). Here is roughly the setup in case you don't have the book handy: Let $A'$ be an Artin local ring with residue field $k$ and maximal ideal $m_{A'}$, let $I$ be an ideal of $A'$ such that $m_{A'}I=0$,  and let $A=A'/I$. Let $X=X_A$ be a projective variety over $\text{Spec } A$, and let $X_s=X_A \otimes k$ be the fiber over the closed point. Let $K,F$ be a $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules flat over $\text{Spec } A$, and let $K_0=K \otimes A/m$, $F_0=F \otimes A/m$ be the restriction to $X_s$.
I think that explains all the notation. Here is my attempt to understand the isomorphism:
An element in $\mathrm{Ext}^1_{X_A}(K, I \otimes_k F_0)$ is given by a short exact sequence
$$0 \to I \otimes_k F_0 \to B \to K \to 0$$ Since $K$ is $A$-flat, hence $\mathrm{Tor}^1_A(K, A/m)=0$
so apply $- \otimes_A A/m_A$ to get an exact sequence (exact on the left because $\mathrm{Tor}^1_A(K, A/m)=0$):
$$0 \to I \otimes_k F_0 \to B_0 \to K_0 \to 0$$ This gives an element of $\mathrm{Ext}^1_{X_s}(K_0, I \otimes_k F_0)$. Here is why we can move the $I$ to the outside: Since $I$ is an ideal supported at the closed point of $A$ (since $m_AI=0$), it is a $k$-vector space, and so we can think of the $\mathcal{O}_{X_s}$-module $I \otimes_k F_0$ as $\dim_k I$ copies of $F_0$, and so we can pull the $I$ outside. Conversely, given an extension $$0 \to I \otimes_k F_0 \to B_0 \to K_0 \to 0$$
I think I need to use the flatness of $K$ (or $F$) to get an extension $B$ $$0 \to I \otimes_k F_0 \to B \to K \to 0$$ but I don't know exactly how.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
847272,"Lies, damned lies, and statistics","A story currently in the U.S. news is that an organization has (in)conveniently had several specific hard disk drives fail within the same short period of time. The question is what is the likelihood that this would happen? I would imagine that it can be determined quantitatively to be very unlikely, and I would like to know if a simple analysis is sufficient to come to that conclusion, or is it necessarily more complicated. We can start with some assumptions, all of which can be challenged. A hard drive fails with an exponential probability density function (pdf) $p(t)= \lambda  e^{- \lambda t}$, where $\lambda$ is the reciprocal of the MTBF (mean time between failures). All hard drives have an MTBF of 500,000 hours and operate under typical conditions . The hard drive failures are independent. (They run on different computers.There is no systematic relationship that would result in a dependency between these failures and any other commonly shared event or condition.) The failures are physical (not systematic, such as software induced) The organization operates 100,000 hard drives like these simultaneously. While investigators argue about who has the better credentials relevant to the question, I believe it's amenable to a straightforward analysis, as follows: An upper bound on $P_{1}(T)$, the probability of a single failure in time T, can be calculated from integrating the pdf on the interval $[0, T]$, where the pdf is maximum. The probability distribution $$P(t) = 1-e^{- \lambda t}$$ can be used to calculate $P(t=T)$. The probability $P_{N}$ of N specific hard drives failing in that time interval is $P_{N}(T)=(P_{1}(T))^N$. The facts in the actual investigation are not totally clear, but it appears that we are talking about 6 specific hard drives failing in a 1 week (168 hours). This leads to $$P_{1}(168)=1-e^{- 168/500,000}=3.36 \times 10^{-4}$$ and $$P_{6}(168)=1.44 \times 10^{-21}$$ This is so incredibly unlikely that I would try modifying my assumptions. First, if the time interval is 13 weeks, then $P_{6}(13*168)=6.85 \times 10^{-15}$. Still incredibly unlikely. Even reducing the MTBF to 10,000 leaves us with $P_{6}(13*168)=5.7 \times 10^{-5}$ or nearly a one in a million chance. One assumption that I didn't use was assumption number 5, that there are 100,000 hard drives within the organization. This is where the lies, damn lies and statistics creep in. But I think it's safe to say that this is irrelevant, given the other assumptions and that we are talking about specific hard drives. Based on this analysis, calculating the probability that N specific hard drives would fail in an interval of time can be easily calculated. Have I made a mistake? Are there other factors that would have a significant effect on the result? If so, how?","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

847302,Solving the ODE $[(1-x^2)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \lambda]f = [\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \frac{\lambda}{a}]g$,"I want to solve $f(x)$ in terms of $g(x)$ in the following ODE
$$\left[(1-x^2)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \lambda\right]f(x) = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \frac{\lambda}{a}\right]g(x),$$
where the constants and boundary conditions are
\begin{aligned}
\lambda \in & \mathbb{C}, \quad \text{Re}[\lambda] < 0 \\
a \in & \mathbb{R} \\
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x) = & 0 \\
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}g(x) = & 0.
\end{aligned}
I expect $f$ and $g$ to be nice (without singular behaviour). Questions 1. How can I get a solution which is valid for all $x$? $x=\pm1$ is especially problematic. 2. What kind of ODE is this? 3. Are there better methods than the one I chose? My approach Multiply by $\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}$, and integrate over $x$:
\begin{aligned}
\text{LHS} & = \int e^{-h(x)}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx - \int \frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}\lambda fdx = \\
           & = \left\{\text{Partial Integration}\right\} = \\
           & = fe^{-h(x)} - \int\frac{\partial (-h)}{\partial x} fe^{-h(x)}dx - \int \frac{\lambda}{1-x^2}fe^{-h(x)}dx.
\end{aligned}
Choose $h(x)$ such that the two integrals cancel
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial (-h)}{\partial x} & = -\frac{\lambda}{1-x^2} \quad \Rightarrow \\
h(x) & = \int \frac{\lambda}{1-x^2} dx = \frac{\lambda}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right).
\end{aligned}
We get
\begin{aligned}
fe^{-h(x)} & = \int\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \frac{\lambda}{a}\right]g(x) dx =\\
& = \int\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}dx - \int\frac{\lambda}{a}\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}g dx\\
& = \left\{\text{Partial Integration}\right\} =\\
& = \frac{ge^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2} - \int g\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}\right)dx - \int\frac{\lambda}{a}\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}g dx
\end{aligned}
Finally, multiplying both sides with $e^{h(x)}$, $f$ is found to be
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & = \frac{g(x)}{1-x^2} - e^{h(x)}\int\left(\frac{2x-\lambda}{1-x^2}+\frac{\lambda}{a}\right)\frac{e^{-h(x)}}{1-x^2}gdx\\
h(x) & = \frac{\lambda}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right).
\end{aligned}
Is it possible to simplify further? This is not valid for $x=\pm1$... Alternate approach Instead of indefinite integrals, use definite integrals from $x_0$ to $x$. My result in this case is
\begin{aligned}
f(x) = & \left[f(x_0) - \frac{g(x_0)}{1-x_0^2}\right]e^{h(x_0,x)} + \\
     + & \frac{g(x)}{1-x^2} - \\
     - & \int\limits_{x_0}^{x}\left(\frac{2t-\lambda}{1-t^2}+\frac{\lambda}{a}\right)\frac{e^{h(t,x)}}{1-t^2}g(t)dt\\
h(t,x) & = \frac{\lambda}{2}\ln\left(\frac{(1+x)(1-t)}{(1-x)(1+t)}\right).
\end{aligned}
Note that as $x\to\infty$, this solution is equivalent to the previous one. Maybe the method with $x_0$ can be used in each respective region? I can't solve it for the middle region though ($|x|<1$), and there's still a problem with $x=\pm1$.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'integration', 'analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

So to take the easiest assumption of i.i.d, with $F$ the CDF (cumulative), under the assumption of i.i.d. we can use $F(a)^n$ for the distribution of the maximum. The density:
$$f(y)=\frac{\partial F(y)^n}{\partial y}= \frac{n e^{-\frac{y}{\beta }} \left(1-e^{-\frac{y}{\beta }}\right)^{n-1}}{\beta }$$

Then $G$ is a group if and only if the following conditions hold: (i) There exist an element $e\in G$ such that $ea=a$ for all $a\in G$ (left identity element); (ii) For each $a\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $a^{-1}a=e$ (left inverse). EDIT: in light of the discussion on the range of quantifier, the answer below showed that it is provable as long as the quantifier in (i) range all the way to include (ii). I still wish to ask whether we can prove it even if the quantifier only range within (i), ie. (ii) should be interpreted as: for each $a\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1}\in G$ such that $a^{-1}a=e$ where $e$ is one of those left identities.","['group-theory', 'proof-verification']"
847649,a question about Tsirelson's space,"Background. Let $T$ denote the Figiel-Johnson construction of the Tsirelson space, that is, the completion of $c_{00}$ under the implicitly-defined norm \begin{equation*}\|x\|_T=\max\left\{\|x\|_{\ell_\infty},\frac{1}{2}\sup\sum_i\|E_ix\|_T\right\}\end{equation*} where the ""sup"" is taken over all $j\in\mathbb{N}$ and all sequences $E_1<\cdots<E_j$ of finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $j\leq\min E_1$. It is well-known that $T$ and its dual $T^*$ are reflexive spaces which each fail to contain any copy of $c_0$ or $\ell_p$, $1\leq p\leq\infty$.  Furthermore, $T^*$ can be represented as the completion of $c_{00}$ under some other norm $\|\cdot\|_{T^*}$, such that elements of $T^*$ act on elements of $T$ in the natural way, i.e. if $f=(\beta_n)\in T^*$ and $x=(\alpha_n)\in T$ then $f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\alpha_n\beta_n$. Problem. Given an arbitrary $C>0$ and an arbitrary subsequence $(e_{n_k})$, I would like to find the coordinates for a sequence $(\gamma_k)\in c_{00}$ such that \begin{equation*}C\|(\gamma_k)\|_{\ell_\infty}\leq\|\sum_{k=1}^\infty\gamma_ke_{n_k}\|_{T^*}.\end{equation*} Discussion. The existence of such a sequence is easy to show given the above facts about $T$ and $T^*$.  Notice that $\|f\|_{\ell_\infty}\leq\|f\|_{T^*}$ for all $f\in c_{00}$.  This is because, due to $c_{00}$ being dense in $T$, for any $\epsilon>0$ we can always find $x\in c_{00}$ with \begin{equation*}\|f\|_{T^*}\|x\|_T\geq|f(x)|\geq(\|f\|_{\ell_\infty}-\epsilon)\|x\|_{\ell_1}\geq(\|f\|_{\ell_\infty}-\epsilon)\|x\|_T.\end{equation*} Thus, since $T^*$ fails to contain a copy of $c_0$, we get the desired sequence $(\gamma_k)$. However, I am interested in a more constructive method of obtaining $(\gamma_k)$.  This is because I will be looking at variations on Tsirelson's space for which the deep result about $T^*$ containing no copy of $c_0$ is not always established.  Is there a way to actually write down the coordinates of $(\gamma_k)$?  For instance, what about something similar to Argyros's construction of repeated averages (special convex combinations)?

847660,An extension of line bundles splits locally,"Consider an extension $0\rightarrow L \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} E \overset{\beta}{\rightarrow} L' \rightarrow 0$ of bundles and bundle homomorphisms, where $L$ and $L'$ are line bundles. (Let's assume that all bundles and maps are holomorphic.) Does it split locally? i.e. is there an open cover $\{U_i\}$ and maps $\sigma_i: L'\vert_{U_i} \rightarrow E\vert_{U_i}$ such that $\beta\circ \sigma_i = \text{id}$? You could use a common trivialization for $L$, $L'$, and $E$, and then you get an extension of trivial bundles, say $0\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow U\times \mathbb{C}^2 \rightarrow U\times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow 0$. So a related question is: do extensions of trivial bundles split locally (or even globally)? In the smooth case you can use a partition of unity to construct a Hermitian metric, and then you get splitting globally. I was hoping to get this local splitting for vector bundles in any setting, i.e. smooth, holomorphic, algebraic, etc.","['algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles']"

Is there any reason to expect that $|S|$ might be asymptotically much smaller than $N$, say $O((\log N)^c)$ or something like that? Example: for $k=3$, $N=27$, we have $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,25,26,27\}$, so $|S|=11$.  The set of good sequences of length 3 that end in 27 are: 1,2,27

Let $A$ be a subring of $R$ and $B$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $A+B = \{a+b|a \in a, b \in B\}$ is a subring of $R$, $A \cap B$ is an ideal of $A$, and $(A+B)/B \cong A/(A \cap B)$. The fourth:
Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. The correspondence $A \leftrightarrow A/I$ is an inclusion preserving bijection between the set of subrings $A$ of $R$ that contain $I$ and the set of subrings of $R/I$.

$$a_{n+1}=a_{n}(1-n^{-\frac{1}{4}}a_{n})$$
Does there a real numbers $A$  which make the limit $$ \lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[4]{n}\left(A-\frac{4}{3}\sqrt[4]{n^3}\left(1-\frac{4}{3}\sqrt[4]{n^3}a_{n}\right) \right)=B$$
exist? if possible find the value of $A$ and $B$. Here is my approach.
First it is easy to find that $\{a_{n}\}$ is a strict decrease sequcence with $a_{n}\to 0 (n\to+\infty)$,and by O.Stolz Therom,we have:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[4]{n^3}a_{n}&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\frac{1}{a_{n}}}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(n+1)^{\frac{3}{4}}-n^{\frac{3}{4}}}{\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n}}}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{3}{4}}-1\right)}{\frac{1}{a_{n}(1-n^{-\frac{1}{4}}a_{n})}-\frac{1}{a_{n}}}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}n\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{3}{4}}-1\right)(1-n^{-\frac{1}{4}a_{n}})\\
&=\frac{3}{4}
\end{align*}
which implys that
$$ a_{n}\sim \frac{3}{4}n^{-\frac{3}{4}} $$
Also we can rewrite the condition into
$$ \frac{1}{a_{n+1}}=\frac{1}{a_{n}}+\frac{n^{-\frac{1}{4}}}{1-n^{-\frac{1}{4}}a_{n}}$$
and expand it
$$\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n}}=n^{-\frac{1}{4}}\left(1+n^{-\frac{1}{4}}a_{n}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}a_{n}^2+o\left(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}a_{n}^2\right)\right)$$
but 
$$ a_{n}\sim \frac{3}{4}n^{-\frac{3}{4}}\Rightarrow \frac{1}{a_{n}}\sim\frac{4}{3}n^{\frac{3}{4}}$$
hence we use O.Stolz again to estimate $\frac{1}{a_{n}}$,it is
\begin{align*}
&\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{a_{n}}-\frac{4}{3}n^{\frac{3}{4}}}{n^{-\frac{1}{4}}}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}-\frac{1}{a_{n}}-\frac{4}{3}\left((n+1)^{\frac{3}{4}}-n^{\frac{3}{4}}\right)}{(n+1)^{-\frac{1}{4}}-n^{-\frac{1}{4}}}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{-\frac{1}{4}}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}a_{n}+n^{-\frac{3}{4}}a_{n}^{2}+o(n^{-\frac{3}{4}}a_{n}^{2})-\frac{4}{3}n^{\frac{3}{4}}\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{3}{4}}-1\right]}{n^{-\frac{1}{4}}\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{n} \right)^{-\frac{1}{4}}-1\right]}\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{-\frac{1}{2}}a_{n}+\frac{1}{8}n^{-\frac{5}{4}}+n^{-\frac{3}{4}}a_{n}^{2}+o(n^{-\frac{5}{4}})}{-\frac{1}{4}n^{-\frac{5}{4}}}=-\frac{7}{2}
\end{align*}
Which leads 
$$\frac{1}{a_{n}}=\frac{4}{3}n^{\frac{3}{4}}-\frac{7}{2}n^{-\frac{1}{4}}+o(n^{-\frac{1}{4}})$$
\begin{align*}
&a_{n}=\frac{1}{\frac{4}{3}n^{\frac{3}{4}}-\frac{7}{2}n^{-\frac{1}{4}}+o(n^{-\frac{1}{4}})}\\
&=\frac{3}{4}n^{-\frac{3}{4}}\cdot \frac{1}{1-\frac{21}{8}\frac{1}{n}+o(\frac{1}{n})}\\
&=\frac{3}{4}n^{-\frac{3}{4}}\left(1+\frac{21}{8}\frac{1}{n}+o(\frac{1}{n})\right)\\
&=\frac{3}{4}n^{-\frac{3}{4}}+\frac{63}{32}n^{-\frac{7}{4}}+o(n^{-\frac{7}{4}})
\end{align*}

847763,Drawing previously undrawn cards from a deck,"Suppose you have a deck of $y$ cards. First, randomly select $y-x$ distinct cards and sign the face of each, then shuffle all the cards back in to the deck. Proceed as follows: Draw a card. If it is already signed, replace the card and shuffle the deck. If it is not yet signed, sign it, then replace the card and shuffle the deck. My question is what is the probability that you will draw an unsigned card as a function of time? For instance, when $t=1$, the probability is $x/y$. When $t=2$, the probability is $\frac{x(x-1)}{y^2}+\frac{(y-x)(x)}{y^2}$ and so on. I have written a Python program that will compute the probabilities for small values of $t$, but the run time is $O(2^t)$ and was wondering if there is a simpler way to solve this problem My solution: The number of summands for time $t$ is $2^{t-1}$, and each is of the form $\frac{a_1a_2\dots a_t}{y^t}$. The set of $t$-tuples $a_1a_2\dots a_t$ appearing in the sum can be put in bijection with the set of odd binary strings of length $t$ as follows: If the $i$-th digit of the string is 1, then $a_i$ is $x$ minus the sum of the previous digits of the string; otherwise, $a_i$ is equal to $y-x$ plus the sum of the previous digits. For instance, $1101$ corresponds with $x(x-1)(y-x+2)(x-2)$ and $1011$ corresponds with $x(y-x+1)(x-1)(x-2)$. It is pretty simple to write an algorithm that will loop over all such binary strings to find the probability.","['statistics', 'puzzle', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

where $\beta=\frac{2}{1-N}$. Is there some way to use this special solution to find the general solution?  It would be of great interest to astrophysicists. The equation is invariant to the Lie group $G(x,y)=(\lambda x,\lambda^\beta y)\lambda_o=0$.  When you apply this group to the DEQ you find that $\beta -2=N\beta$, or $\beta=\frac{2}{1-N}$  Its invariants (polynomial group stabilizers in the kernel of the map) are $\eta=\frac{\ddot{y}}{x^{\beta -2}}$, $\nu=\frac{\dot{y}}{x^{\beta-1}}$ and $\mu=\frac{y}{x^\beta}$.  The Lane-Emden equation expressed as invariants is $\eta+2\nu+\mu^N=0$. $$
\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}=\frac{x\frac{d\nu}{dx}}{x\frac{d\mu}{dx}}=\frac{\eta-(\beta -1)\nu}{\nu-\beta\mu}

Since $\eta=-\mu^N-2\nu$, this becomes
$$

847886,"Existence of increasing, smooth modulus of continuity","First, recall the definition: Given a function $f:M\to N$, where $M$ and $N$ are metric spaces, a modulus of continuity for $f$ is a function $\omega:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ such that $\omega(0)=\lim_{t\to 0^+}\omega(t)=0$; For every $x,x'\in M$,  $d(f(x),f(x'))\leq\omega(d(x,x'))$. According to Wikipedia , the existence of a modulus of continuity $\omega$ for a function $f$ implies the existence of a increasing and smooth (in $(0,\infty)$) modulus of continuity for $f$. I don't see how we can obtain this. The way suggested is the following: Given a modulus of identity $\omega$, let $\omega_1(t)=\sup_{s\leq t}\omega(s)$. Then $\omega_1$ is also a modulus of identity and is increasing (hence measurable, and locally integrable). Then, let $\omega_2(t)=\frac{1}{t}\int_t^{2t}\omega_1(s)ds$. $\omega_2$ is also a modulus of identity and it is continuous. I haven't checked, but I believe that with Lebesgue's Differentiation Theorem or something of the kind, we can show that $\omega_2$ is non-decreasing (alternatively, simply use $\omega_3(t)=\sup_{s\leq t}\omega_2(t)$). Then, it is stated that a suitable adaptation in the definition of $\omega_2$ will give us a smooth function. By this ""suitable adaptation"" I believe we should use some kind of molification: Notice that the definition of $\omega_2$ is pretty much molification by the pulse function $p(x)=\begin{cases}1&\text{, if }|x|\leq 1/2\\0&\text{, otherwise}\end{cases}$. This is what I was thinking: Let $\rho:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be smooth, non-negative, $\operatorname{supp}\rho\subseteq[-1,1]$, and $\int_{-1}^1\rho(x)dx=1$. Making an abuse of notation, let's define, for $t>0$, $\rho(x,t)=\frac{2}{t}\rho(\frac{2x}{t}-3)$, so that $\operatorname{supp}\rho(\cdot,t)\subseteq[t,2t]$ and $\int_t^{2t}\rho(x,t)dx=1$. Finally, we define $\widetilde{w}(t)=\int_t^{2t}\rho(x,t)w(x)dx$. Using the usual arguments about molifications/Dominated Convergence, it is easy to show that $\widetilde{w}$ is smooth in $(0,\infty)$, and Dominated Convergence also implies that $\lim_{t\to 0}\widetilde{w}(t)=0$. The problem is showing that $\widetilde{w}$ is increasing. Alternative approachs are appreciated.","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

I know that the Lagrange equation is going to be: $ L(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} - L_1(x + y + 2z - 2)-L_2(z - x^2 - y^2)$ For simplicity it can be rewritten as: $ L(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - L_1(x + y + 2z - 2)-L_2(z - x^2 - y^2)$ And that the equation system will be: $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 2x - L_1 + 2 L_2 x = 0 $ $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 2y - L_1 + 2 L_2 y = 0 $ $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = 2z - 2L_1 - L_2 = 0 $ $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial L_1} = x + y + 2z - 2 = 0 $ $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial L_2} = z - x^2 - y^2 = 0 $ Solving this system is really giving me a hard time, so instead of asking for the answer (which it could also help to see what are your procedures) I'd like to know if there are any known tips that could lead on a solution for the system.","['multivariable-calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier']"

847980,How to Count the number of words over an alphabet subject to restrictions on letter count?,"For an alphabet $X$, is there a method of computing how many words over $X$ of length $n$ there are where the number of occurrences of each letter must satisfy a system of equations? For example if $|X| = 5$. Let ${\{a, b, c, d, e}\}$ represent the number of times each of the five letters appears in a length $n$ word over $X$. With no restrictions I believe the number of words would be $5^n$. What about subject to the restriction $2a+2e=2d+2b-c$? Edit: So I had the idea that we could form a set of prime words, such that every word that satisfies the equation could be decomposed into these smaller words (up to permuting the letters of the original word). Labelling each of the letters ${A,B,C,D,E}$, this set is $\{AD, AB, ED, EB, DCC, BCC\}$, so there are $4$ prime words of length $2$ and $2$ of length $3$ from which all words satisfying the condition must be composed (up to permutation). Then we can get the total number by checking the partitions of $n$: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} 
\hline 1 & 0 \\ 
\hline 2 & 4 \\ 
\hline 3 & 2 \\ 
\hline 4 & 4^2=16 \\ 
\hline 5 & 4.2=8 \\ 
\hline 6 & 4^3+2^2=68 \\ 
\hline 7 & 4^2.2=32 \\ 
\hline 8 & 4^4+4.2^2=272 \\

Choose $F_n$ such that $\mu(F_n)<1/n$ and $f$ continuous on $E\setminus F_n$. Since $f$ is continuous on $E\setminus F_{n-1}$, we can choose $F_n\subseteq F_{n-1}$.

There's been speculation about possible collusion, especially given the friendly relationship between the two coaches, but let's assume that both teams will follow their professional ethos and will maximize their own chances of getting to the next round (not of winning this particular game) without trying to make a deal with the other team. This article claims that there's no reason to worry that the game will be boring, and both teams will play to win, until at some point late in the game, if the score is even, they may decide to go for a draw. That makes some intuitive sense; so I was wondering: Can we provide mathematical support for this qualitative prediction about the optimal strategies of the teams? For simplicity, let's assume that the teams advance if they win or draw and don't advance if they lose (which is not quite true, since if they lose the result will depend also on the result of the other game in the group, in different ways for the two teams); and also ignore the incentive to win that arises because that's likely to lead to a weaker opponent in the next round.","['markov-chains', 'game-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'probability']"

Therefore, $\forall ~ \epsilon > 0, \exists ~ N \in \mathbb{N} : \left|\left| X^{(l)} - X^{(m)}\right|\right|_{1} < \epsilon   \space\space \forall ~ l,m \ge N $.

My initial thoughts is that because $\bar{\Bbb Q}$ is countable and for an $\alpha_n\in\bar{\Bbb Q}\backslash\Bbb Q$ with $n\in\Bbb N_0$ and $\alpha_0=1$ we can say that any algebraic number $\beta\in\bar{\Bbb Q}$ can be written as $$\beta=\sum_{k\ge0}\alpha_kp_{k+1}=p_1+\alpha_1p_2+\alpha_2p_3+\cdots$$
Now there are automorphisms on $\bar{\Bbb Q}$ that I know are in a set $A\subset \operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\Bbb Q}/\Bbb Q)$ and $A=\{\imath, *_1, *_2,...\}$ where $*_n$ is conjugation of the $n^\text{th}$ term. So I am hoping that there is a $B=\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\Bbb Q}/\Bbb Q)\backslash A$ which is also countable or uncountable. Which means the problem is no just determining the cardinality of $B$.","['galois-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

This is obvious, cause it converges in $L^p$ and it converges in measure( this was the way I did it). Despite, I noticed that besides some discrete examples, there are very few examples where you show the convergence in distribution directly.
I know that convergence in distribution can be shown via the convergence of the distribution function where it is continuous, by the pointwise convergence of the characteristic function and by the convergence of $E(f \circ X_n) \rightarrow E(f\circ X)$ where $f$ is an arbitrary bounded and continuous function. Honestly, I don't know what the best strategy of the three ones possible would be, cause they all sound difficult.

Prove that $E$ is bounded and contains both sup$E$ and inf$E$. Here is my sad attempt: Let $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a bounded sequence, and let $E$ be a set of subsequential limits of that sequence. $E$ is not empty since every bounded sequence of real numbers has at least one convergent subsequence. Suppose $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a real number $L$. Then $E=\{L\}$, since every subsequence of $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must also converge to $L$. Therefore, $E$ is bounded and sup$E$=inf$E$=$L\in E$. Suppose $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ diverges . As stated above, there is at least one convergent subsequence, so $E$ is not empty. Let $S$ be the range of $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. Then $S$ is bounded since the sequence is bounded Suppose $S$ is finite; that is, $S=\{x_1,...,x_k\}$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Then there exists a term $x_i$ with $1\leq i\leq k$, of $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ that repeats infinitely many times, and thus the subsequence $\{x_i\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $x_i$. This implies that, $E\subset S$, which also implies that $E$ is bounded, since $S$ is bounded. Furthermore, since $S$ is finite, then $S$ has a smallest and largest element and so does $E$. Hence, inf$E=$ min$E$ and sup$E=$ max$E$, which are both contained in $E$. Suppose $S$ is infinite. Then, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, there is at least one accumulation point, $a_1$, and thus, at least one subsequence that converges to $a_1$. Let $A$ be the set of all accumulation points of $S$. Then $E\subset A$, since for each member $a_i$ of $A$ there exists a subsequence of $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ that converges to $a_i$. Also, notice that since $S$ is bounded, then there exists $M_1,M_2\in\mathbb{R}$, with $M_1<M_2$, such that for all $x\in S$, $x\in(M_1,M_2)$. If $A$ is finite, then $A$ must have a smallest and a largest element, which implies that $E$ has a smallest and largest element. So, inf$E=$ min$E$ and sup$E=$ max$E$, which are both contained in $E$, which also implies that $E$ is bounded. Suppose $A$ is infinite. Every element of $S$ being contained in $(M_1,M_2)$ implies that every element of $A$ is contained in $[M_1,M_2]$. Thus, since $E\subset A$, $E$ is bounded. We also see that $A$ has a smallest and largest element. Ok, that's as far as I can go. All I need to show now is that inf$E$ and sup$E$ are contained in $E$, but I just can't seem to figure that out. I'm sure that there is probably a better way to approach this whole proof.
