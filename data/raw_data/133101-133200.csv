2087529,"Given $a_1=1, a_2=2, a_{n+1}=n(a_n+a_{n-1})$ find the general term [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Finding $a_n$ if $a_0=a_1=1,a_{n+1}=n(a_n+a_{n-1})\ \ (n\ge 1).$ (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Given recursively defined sequence $(a_n)$: $$a_1=1$$ $$a_2=2$$ $$a_{n+1}=n(a_n+a_{n-1}), n\geq 2$$ Find the formula for the general term $a_n$. This is what I did: So the first few terms are: $a_1=1, a_2=2,a_3=6,a_4=24,a_5=120,...$ 
I guess the general term can be written as $n!$. Let's prove it by mathematical induction: Base case: $a_1=1!=1$ so it's true for $n=1$.
Let's assume it's true for some $n$,i.e. $a_n=n!$. Then $$a_{n+1}=n(a_n+a_{n-1})=n(n!+(n-1)!)=n(n(n-1)!+(n-1)!)=n(n-1)!(n+1)=(n+1)n(n-1)!=(n+1)!$$ Using the principle of mathematical induction we've proved that the general term of this sequence is $n!$. Is this proof valid? I'm not sure whether it's allowed to put $a_{n-1}=(n-1)!$ here.","['induction', 'recurrence-relations', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification']"
2087554,"A simple proof that there exixsts lebesgue measurable sets, not borel measurable","I was thinking if this simple argument can be used to show that there are lebesgue measurable sets, that are not borel measurable. Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{N+M}$ be a borel measurable set, then we can easily prove that the slices $E_x = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^M : (x,y) \in E\}$ are borel measurable for each $x \in R^N$. This can be done by seeing that the claim is true for every box in $\mathbb{R}^{N+M}$, and proving that $M = \{ E \in \mathbb{R}^{N+M} : E_x\ \text{is borel measurable for all}\ x\in \mathbb{R}^N \}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Now assume that all Lebesgue measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}^{N+M}$ are borel measurable, thus we get that all the slices $E_x$ of a Lebesgue measurable sets, are borel, and thus Lebesgue, measurable. This is a contradiction, in fact, for $N \ge 1$ and $M \ge 1$ we can generalize the following construction: Take $V$ the Vitali set in $\mathbb{R}$ consider $\{0\}\ \text{x}\ V= E$. It's easy to see that $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is Lebesgue measurable, being a set of outer measure zero, but the slice $E_0$ is the Vitali set in $\mathbb{R}$ and thus not lebesgue (borel) measurable. I think it should work as a proof that there are, in $\mathbb{R}^N$ for $N \ge 1$, lebesgue measurable sets, wich are not borel measurable. What do you think?","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'solution-verification']"

I tried expending the sum and using induction, but could not complete the induction step; I tried using Pascal's identity to obtain $$ \binom{n-m}{\bigl\lfloor \frac{2k+3-m}{2} \bigr\rfloor}=\binom{n-m+1}{\bigl\lfloor \frac{2k+3-m}{2} \bigr\rfloor}-\binom{n-m}{\bigl\lfloor \frac{2k+1-m}{2} \bigr\rfloor} $$ but couldn't find other identities to complete the induction step. Searching Gould's Combinatorial Identities brought up nothing, though I could easily had missed something useful there. I'm looking to complete the induction step, but would also like to find an algebraic or a combinatorial proof.

Now since $m(E)>0$ we can find compact interval inside it (is this true or not?)
If this is true so the proof is completed. I know that if $E$ is measurable then $E$ is either Borel set or a set of measure zero. So here $E$ is Borel, but still not necessarily to be an interval.","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"
2087679,Proving $x^4+y^4=z^2$ has no integer solutions,"I need solution check to see if I overlooked something: If $x^4+y^4=z^2$ has an integer solution then $(\frac{x}{y})^4+1=(\frac{z}{y^2})^2$ has a solution in rationals.

By using SAGE we can see that Mordell-Weil group of this elliptic curve is empty (SAGE returns empty set, but I'm not sure if that is enough to conclude this), so we can conclude that there are no rational solutions to the second equation and no integer solution to the first one. edit: No integer solution in positive integers .","['number-theory', 'elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2087694,Effective strategy for determining the adjoint of an unbounded operator?,"For example, let's suppose $H=L^{2}[0,1]$ and our operator $T:D(T)\subset H\to H$ is defined by $$T:=i\frac{d}{dx},\qquad D(T):=C^{1}_{0}(0,1).$$ It's easy enough to show analytically that this operator is symmetric (i.e. $T\subset T^{\ast}$). But the rest of the arguments; even proving that $T$ is unbounded and densely defined is very heuristic . Certainly, to show that $T$ is unbounded we can define $$u_{n}(x):=\begin{cases}1-nx,&\qquad 0\le x\le 1/n,\\ 0,&\qquad 1/n<x\le 1,\end{cases}$$
and this does the job, since $\|T\|=\sup\|Tu_{n}\|/\|u_{n}\|=\sqrt{3}n>n\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. To prove that $T$ is densely defined we can appeal to an argument whereby $D(T)$ contains an orthonormal sequence (involving Hermite polynomials) and this sequence is total in $H$ so that $D(T)$ is dense. As if this wasn't bad enough, in order to prove that $T^{\ast}$ (which obviously exists since $T$ is densely defined) is given by $$T^{\ast}=i\frac{d}{dx},\qquad D(T^{\ast})=\{u\in AC[0,1]:u'\in L^{2}[0,1]\},$$ we have to again consider an arbitrary subinterval of $[0,1]$ on which we construct a sequence $(u_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset D(T)$ which converges to the indicator function of our arbitrary interval and et cetera...et cetera... So my question is if someone can provide me with some analytical intuition for the aforementioned steps (proving unboundedness, densely definedness and even determining the adjoint...although that's a lot of work)? At the moment it just seems very heuristic.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'unbounded-operators']"

2087765,What is the purpose of this axiom in the definition of a uniform space?,"I started reading about uniform spaces the other day, and in an attempt to familiarize myself with the notion I attempted to work through some examples based on the entourage definition of a uniformity. I was able to understand and verify the uniformity on a metric space in which $\{\{(x,\ y)\ |\ d(x,\ y)<a\}\ |\ a\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\}$ is a fundamental system of entourages. However, something still doesn't sit well with me, and that's the 4th axiom wikipedia gives: If $U\in\Phi$, then there is some $V\in\Phi$ for which $(x,\ y)\in V$ and $(y,\ z)\in V$ implies $(x,\ z)\in U$. I recognize that this implies that for all $U\in\Phi$, there is $V\in\Phi$ for which $V\circ V\subseteq U$ where $\circ$ is the binary relation composition operator. My question is: why? Why is it necessary to include this in the definition of a uniform space? As far as I've read, it appears to me uniform spaces were invented to generalize the notion of uniform continuity between spaces: a map between uniform spaces is uniformly continuous if the image of an entourage in the domain space is an entourage in the codomain space. This also allows us to generalize the notion of Cauchy sequences to Cauchy nets. I understand that a net $(x_\alpha)$ is a Cauchy net if for every entourage $U$ there is $\lambda$ such that whenever $\alpha,\ \beta > \lambda$, $(x_\alpha,\ x_\beta)\in U$. Now, I can understand how the notion of a Cauchy net generalizes the notion of a Cauchy sequence (under the condition that an entourage is taken to be a binary relation of ""closeness""), but I haven't worked through the details of why the above definition of a uniformly continuous map preserves Cauchy nets (though it doesn't sound too far off from the usual proof that uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$ preserve Cauchy sequences). I read in this answer that the 4th axiom is essentially inspired by the triangle inequality, but that doesn't quite make sense to me either. I suppose it could be that axiom 4 is meant to generalize the notion of a metric space, in which uniform continuity can be defined (and in fact, the notion of a metric is required in the usual definition of uniform continuity), but I still don't quite see how omitting the 4th axiom would break the definition of uniform continuity. So, what part of all of this, the generalization of Cauchy sequences and uniform continuity, is the 4th axiom required for? Why would omitting the 4th axiom be a problem, and why does the 4th axiom ""fix"" the problem, and properly generalize uniform continuity?","['general-topology', 'uniform-spaces']"
2087808,Slick proofs that if $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{k}$ converges then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_k=0$,"I'm looking for slick proofs that if $a_n$ is a sequence of complex numbers such that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{k}$ converges then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_k=0$. My not so slick proof: Let $A_x=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{x} a_k$ and apply an Abel sum with the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. We get $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{k}-\int\limits_1^n\frac{A_x}{x^2}dx=\frac{A_n}{n}.$$ Of course we can split the integral into chunks to get $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{k}-\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{1}{k+1}-\frac{1}{k} \right) A_k=\frac{A_n}{n}.$$ If we expand $A_k$ on the left side, it telescopes and yields $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac{a_k}{k} + \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \left( 1-\frac{1}{k+1}\right) a_k=\frac{A_n}{n}\iff \frac{(n-1)A_n}{n}=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{a_k}{k(k+1)}.$$ The norm of the right side  of the equation is clearly $\mathcal O(\log(n))$ (using the triangle inequality and the fact that $\frac{a_k}{k}$ is bounded). The desired result follows after dividing both sides by $n-1$. I would also appreciate some proof verification. Initially, I thought that the problem was going to be really easy, but it took me a bit of effort. Am I missing something major? The original problem is for real sequences, but I don't think this helps.

I am aware that any holomorphic vector bundle (of finite rank) over $\mathbb{C}P^1$ splits as a direct sum of holomorphic line bundles (is that result due to Grothendieck by the way?). So if $Z$ for instance has low dimension, computing Chern classes can come in handy, as well as using adjunction formulas. But what other methods are available in the general case, where the dimension of $Z$ could be high, say. As another question, suppose you were able to describe the normal bundle $N$ using a short exact sequence $0 \to E \to N \to F \to 0$ where both $E$ and $F$ are known, and their direct sum decomposition is known.

2089080,Exponential diophantine equation involving a prime number,"Few days ago I found a question which was unfortunately put ""on hold"" and later it was even deleted. The question asked to solve the following exponential diophantine equation $$p^{p+1}+(p+1)^p=x^2$$
where $x$ is a positive integer and $p$ is a prime number. Since I like diophantine equations I found this one very interesting and I tried to solve it. Here is what I did: we can assume that $p$ is odd because for $p=2$ there is no solution, so $p+1=2n$ and thus we can write $$(2n)^p=(p+1)^p=x^2-p^{2n}=(x+p^n)(x-p^n).$$ Now, from the original equation we get that $x$ is odd and $x\equiv \pm 1\pmod p$, then $\gcd(x+p^n, x-p^n)=2$, and therefore we can write $x+p^n=2^{\alpha}\cdot y$ and $x-p^n=2^{\beta}\cdot z$, with exactly one of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ being equal to $1$ because $\alpha+\beta\ge p\ge 3$. More precisely, if $n=2^r\cdot m$, then $$2^{p+rp}\cdot m^p=2^{\alpha+\beta}\cdot yz.$$ Hence $p(r+1)=\alpha+\beta$ and $m^p=yz$ with $\gcd(y,z)=1$, which means that $y=y_1^p$ and $z=z_1^p$, for some $y_1, z_1\in\Bbb{Z}^+$ such that $\gcd(y_1, z_1)=1$. Sadly, I couldn't do anything else and I got stuck here until I remembered that the general equation $y^x+x^y=z^2$ was solved in this paper when $\gcd(x,y)=1$, $xy$ is even and $\min\{x,y\}>1$. In our particular equation the required conditions are satisfied because $\gcd(p+1,p)=1$, $(p+1)p$ is even and $\min\{p+1,p\}\ge 3$, so according to that paper our equation doesn't have any solutions. The only problem that I found is that the equation $y^x+x^y=z^2$ was solved using bounds for linear forms in logarithms , which are beyond from being elementary. So this is my question: is there a more elementary solution for the equation $p^{p+1}+(p+1)^p=x^2$ ? Thanks in advance for your answers.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'diophantine-equations']"

however I don't know how to vary the gradient term.  The indices get confusing when varying the gradient terms.
I am looking for a complete rigorous solution, thanks  a lot for your help! My approach so far is :
$$
\delta I= \delta \int \nabla_k X_{\alpha j} \nabla_k \bar{X}_{\alpha j}=\int \delta \left( \nabla_k X_{\alpha j} \nabla_k \bar{X}_{\alpha j}\right)
$$ 
$$
\delta I =\int \left(\nabla_k \delta X_{\alpha j} \nabla_k \bar{X}_{\alpha j}+\nabla_k X_{\alpha j} \nabla_k \delta (\bar{X}_{\alpha j})\right)
$$
but is $\delta X_{\alpha j}=0$?? since I am varying wrt $X^H$, if so I have 
$$
\delta I = \int\nabla_k X_{\alpha j} \nabla_k \delta (\bar{X}_{\alpha j})=-\int \nabla_k \nabla_k X_{\alpha j} \delta(\bar{X}_{\alpha j})
$$ 
where I integrated by parts on the last line to get the derivative off the $\delta$.  Thus I  get
$$
\frac{\delta I}{\delta X^H}=- \nabla_k \nabla_k A_{\alpha j}
$$
Is this correct?  THanks a lot!","['derivatives', 'matrices', 'matrix-calculus', 'calculus', 'functional-analysis']"
2089112,$A$ is bounded$\Rightarrow f(A)$ is bounded.,"Given a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a continuous function $f$, does $A$ being bounded imply that $f(A)$ is bounded? For $f(A)$ being non-bounded the condition $\exists s \in \mathbb{R} \forall a \in A: |f(a)| < s$ had to be broken. In a coninuous function that would mean that either $\limsup f(A) = \infty$ or $\liminf f(A) = -\infty$ or both, which is, as I think, not possible with a bounded domain since the function ""ends"" somewhere and thus a bigger or smaller value can respectively always be found in $\mathbb{R}$.

Set $X_t:= \int_0^t \phi_s dB_s$. Compute $\left<X,B\right>_t$, i.e. the quadratic covariation of $X_t$ and $B_t$. (the space is endowed with a filtration $\left(F_t\right)_{t\geq 0}$ and the brownian motion is adapted w.r.t. to it) $\boldsymbol{First}$ $\boldsymbol{attempt}$: let 
$\Pi_n $:=$\{0=t_0<\ldots<t_n= t \}$ be a partition of $[0,t]$.
$$\left<X,B\right>_t:= \lim_{|\Pi_n|\to0}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}[X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_{i}}][B_{t_{i+1}}-B_{t_{i}}]=\\ \lim_{|\Pi_n|\to0}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}X_{t_{i+1}}[B_{t_{i+1}}-B_{t_{i}}]-X_{t_{i}}[B_{t_{i+1}}-B_{t_{i}}].
$$ The second term should converge to $\int_0^t X_s dB_s$ in $L^2$, but i don't know what to do with the first term since it cannot converge to the Ito integral of $X$ w.r.t. the brownian motion. $\boldsymbol{Second}$ $\boldsymbol{attempt}$: I know that $$\left<X,B\right>_t= \frac{1}{4} (\left<X+B\right>_t-\left<X-B\right>_t).$$ Now, since $\left<X+B\right>_t$ is the unique process s.t. $\left(X_t+B_t\right)^2-\left<X+B\right>_t$ is a martingale, if i compute $E[X_t^2+B_t^2+2X_tB_t|F_s]$, $s<t$ i will be done. I know that $E[B_t^2|F_s]=B_s^2+t-s$. My strategy for $2E[X_tB_t|F_s]$ is to consider the simple process $\phi^{Q}_t=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\phi_{t_{k}}\mathbb{1}_{[t_{k},t_{k+1}]}(t)$, where Q is a partition of $[0,t]$ and to compute $2E[\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\phi^Q_{t_k}\left(B_{t_{k+1}}-B{t_k}\right)B_t|F_s]$ but i cannot proceed further.

2089143,Proof of a property of curves intersecting transversely,"Let $F, G \subset \mathbb{A}^2$ be affine plane curves that share no common tangents at a point $P \in \mathbb{A}^2$. Let $I$ be the ideal of $k[X, Y]$ generated by $X$ and $Y$. By a change of coordinates, we may assume $P = (0, 0)$. Write $m$ (resp. $n$) for the multiplicity of $F$ (resp. $G$) at $P$. It is a lemma in Fulton's Algebraic Curves (chapter 3, section 3) that if $t \geq m + n - 1$, then $I^t \subset (F, G)\mathcal{O}_P(\mathbb{A}^2)$. I am having trouble understanding the proof of this lemma, which I paraphrase here: To simplify notation, let $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_P(\mathbb{A}^2)$. Let $L_1, \dots, L_m$ be the tangents to $F$ at $P$, and $M_1, \dots, M_n$ be the tangents to $G$ at $P$. Furthermore, let $L_i = L_m$ if $i \geq m$, and $M_j = M_n$ if $j \geq n$. Set $A_{ij} = L_1 \cdots L_i M_1 \cdots M_j$. Because no $L_i = M_j$ for any $i, j$, it is known that $\{A_{ij} | i + j = t\}$ forms a basis for the vector space of all forms of degree $t$ in $k[X, Y]$. It thus suffices to show that $A_{ij} \in (F, G)\mathcal{O}$ for all $i + j \geq m + n - 1$. But $i + j \geq m + n - 1$ means $i \geq m$ or $j \geq n$, so say for example $ i \geq m$. Then $A_{ij} = A_{m0}B,$ where $B$ is a form of degree $t = i + j - m$. Write $F = A_{m0} + F'$, where all terms of $F'$ are of degree $\geq m + 1$. Then $A_{ij} = BF - BF'$, where each term of $BF'$ has degree $\geq i + j + 1$. The claim is that at this point, it suffices to show that $I^t \subset (F, G)\mathcal{O}$ for all sufficiently large $t$ (i.e., there is some $N$ for which $I^t \subset (F, G) \mathcal{O}$ whenever $t \geq N$). This is a consequence of the Nullstellensatz, but I fail to see how that implies the lemma. Any help is appreciated. Edit : I believe I understand it now. This is a descending argument by induction: suppose that $I^{t+1} \subset (F, G) \mathcal{O}$. Then $BF' \in (F, G) \mathcal{O}$, so $I^t \subset (F, G)\mathcal{O}$. The base case is handled by the ""sufficiently large"" part.","['intersection-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

First it is obvious that $ \ T^{-1} \big[ B_F(0_F, \alpha) \big] \ $ is an open set of $E$, $ \forall T \in \mathcal{C} \, $.

So we have that $L$ is infinite and $ \ \mathcal{C} \setminus \{ 0_L \} \neq \varnothing \, $. It follows that $ \ \mathcal{C} \neq \{ 0_L \}$, $ \ E \neq \{ 0_E \} \ $ and $ \ F \neq \{ 0_F \}$. Obs .: when $\mathcal{C}$ is countable, the set $G$ is a $G_{\delta}$ of $E$.

Let $ \ D = \Big\{ \lVert T(x) \rVert_F \in \mathbb{R}_{^+} \ : \ T \in \mathcal{C} \ \ \text{ and } \ \ x \in G \Big\} \, $. Since $ \ 0_E \in G \ $ and $ \ \mathcal{C} \neq \varnothing \, $, we have that $ \ 0 \in D \ $. Thus $ \ D \neq \varnothing \, $. Moreover, by the second item above, $D$ is bounded. So there exists the supremum (least upper bound) of $D$, say $ \ s = \sup(D) = \text{lub}(D) \, $, with $ \ 0 \leq s \leq \alpha \, $. Here is a digression: actually $ \ s>0 \, $. Suppose that $ \ s = 0 \ $. Then one has $ \ D = {0} \, $. Let $ \ x \in G \, $. We have $ \ \lVert T(x) \rVert_F = 0 \ \Rightarrow \ T(x) = 0_F \ \Rightarrow \ x \in ker(T)$, $ \forall T \in \mathcal{C} \, $. It follows that $ \ x \in \bigcap_{T \in \mathcal{C}} ker(T) \, $. Consequently, $ \ B_E \left( 0_E , \alpha/R \right) \subset G \subset \bigcap_{T \in \mathcal{C}} ker(T) \, $. Now $ \ \bigcap_{T \in \mathcal{C}} ker(T) \ $ is a vector subspace of $E$ that contains an open ball. Whence $ \ \bigcap_{T \in \mathcal{C}} ker(T) = E \, $. Thereafter, for all $ \ T \in \mathcal{C} \, $, we have that $ \ E = \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{C}} ker(A) \subset ker(T) \ \Rightarrow \ ker(T) = E \ \Rightarrow \ T = 0_L \, $. So $ \ \mathcal{C} = \{ 0_L \} \, $, a contradiction with the fact that $\mathcal{C}$ is infinite. Similarly, fix $ \ p \in G \ $ and let $ \ D_p = \Big\{ \lVert T(p) \rVert_F \in \mathbb{R}_{^+} \ : \ T \in \mathcal{C} \Big\} \, $. Since $ \ \mathcal{C} \neq \varnothing \, $, we have that $ \ D_p \neq \varnothing \, $. Moreover, $\forall T \in \mathcal{C}$, again by the second item above, we have that $ \ \lVert T(p) \rVert_F < \alpha \, $. Hence $D_p \, $ is bounded. So there exists the supremum $ \ s_p = \sup(D_p) \, $, with $ \ 0 \leq s_p \leq \alpha \, $. Since $ \ D_p \subset D \, $, we have that $ \ 0 \leq s_p \leq s \leq \alpha \, $. Indeed it is easy to show that $ \ \displaystyle \sup_{p \in G} s_p = s \, $. If $ \ p = 0_E \, $, then $ \ D_p = \{ 0 \} \ \Rightarrow \ s_p = 0 \, $. But we can choose $ \ p \neq 0_E \, $, since $ \ B_E \left( 0_E , \alpha/R \right) \subset G \ $ and $ \ B_E \left( 0_E , \alpha/R \right) \neq \{ 0_E \} \, $, as $ \ E \neq \{ 0_E \} \, $. In that case, $ \ 0 < s_p \leq s \leq \alpha \, $. Like above, again we proved that $ \ s>0 \, $. My first attempt was restricting $ \ \alpha \neq s \, $. Then $ \ 0 < s_p \leq s < \alpha \, $ and we have that $$0< \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \leq \frac{\alpha - s_p}{R} \ \ . $$ But then I am afraid that I arrived at a contradiction. I will explain it below. Let $ \ p \in G \ $ and $ \ x \in B_E \left( p , \frac{\alpha - s_p}{R} \right) \, $. Hence, for all $ \ T \in \mathcal{C} \, $, one has $ \ \lVert T(p) \rVert_F \leq s_p \ $ and then \begin{eqnarray*} \lVert T(x) \rVert_F & = & \lVert T(x - p) + T(p) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T(x - p) \rVert_F + \lVert T(p) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T \rVert_L \cdot \lVert x - p \rVert_E + \lVert T(p) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T \rVert_L \cdot \lVert x - p \rVert_E + s_p \\ & < & R \cdot \lVert x - p \rVert_E + s_p \\ & < & R \cdot \frac{(\alpha - s_p)}{R} + s_p \\ &=& \alpha \ .
\end{eqnarray*} Thus $ \ x \in T^{-1} \big[ B_F (0_F , \alpha) \big] \, $, $\forall T \in \mathcal{C}$, that is, $x \in G$. Therefore $ \ B_E \left( p , \frac{\alpha - s_p}{R} \right) \subset G \ \Rightarrow \ p \in int(G) \, $. Since $p$ is arbitrary, it follows that $G$ is open. But a similar argument shows a stronger fact: Let $ \ x \in G \ $ and $ \ u \in B_E \left( x , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \, $. Hence, for all $ \ T \in \mathcal{C} \, $, one has $ \ \lVert T(x) \rVert_F \leq s \ $ and then \begin{eqnarray*} \lVert T(u) \rVert_F & = & \lVert T(u - x) + T(x) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T(u - x) \rVert_F + \lVert T(x) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T \rVert_L \cdot \lVert u - x \rVert_E + \lVert T(x) \rVert_F \\ & \leq & \lVert T \rVert_L \cdot \lVert u - x \rVert_E + s \\ & < & R \cdot \lVert u - x \rVert_E + s \\ & < & R \cdot \frac{(\alpha - s)}{R} + s \\ &=& \alpha \ .
\end{eqnarray*} Thus $ \ u \in T^{-1} \big[ B_F (0_F , \alpha) \big] \, $, $\forall T \in \mathcal{C}$, that is, $u \in G$. Therefore $ \ B_E \left( x , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \, $. This reasoning gives a broader result because the radius $ \ \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \ $ do not depend on $x \, $: For all $ \ x \in G \ $ we have that $ \ B_E \left( x , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \, $. Let $ \ x \in E$. If $ \ x \in B_E (0_E , \alpha/R)$, then $ \ x \in G$. Suppose that $ \ x \notin B_E (0_E , \alpha/R) \, $. Then $ \ x \neq 0_E \ $ and $ \ 0 < \frac{\alpha}{2R} < \frac{\alpha}{R} \leq \lVert x \rVert_E \ \Rightarrow \ 2R \lVert x \rVert_E - \alpha > 0 \, $. Let $ \ (x_n) \in E^{\mathbb{N}} \ $ be such that, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $$x_n = \frac{[\alpha + n(\alpha - s)]}{2R \lVert x \rVert_E} \cdot x$$ So we have $ \ \lVert x_0 \rVert_E = \frac{\alpha}{2R} < \frac{\alpha}{R} \ \Rightarrow \ x_0 \in B_E \left( 0_E , \frac{\alpha}{R} \right) \subset G \ \Rightarrow \ x_0 \in G \ \Rightarrow \ B_E \left( x_0 , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \, $. Let $ \ N = \Big\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \ : \ B_E \left( x_n , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \Big\}$. Hence $ \ 0 \in N$. Let $ \ n \in N$, ie, $B_E \left( x_n , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G$. We have that \begin{eqnarray*} \lVert x_{n+1} - x_n \rVert_E & = & \left\lVert \frac{[\alpha + (n+1)(\alpha - s)]}{2R \lVert x \rVert_E} \cdot x - \frac{[\alpha + n(\alpha - s)]}{2R \lVert x \rVert_E} \cdot x \right\rVert_E \\ & = & \frac{[\alpha + (n+1)(\alpha - s)] - [\alpha + n(\alpha - s)]}{2R} \\ & = & \frac{\alpha - s}{2R} \\ & < & \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \\ & \Rightarrow & x_{n+1} \in B_E \left( x_n , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \\ & \Rightarrow & x_{n+1} \in G \\ & \Rightarrow & B_E \left( x_{n+1} , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \\ & \Rightarrow & n+1 \in N \ .
\end{eqnarray*} By induction, we conclude that $ \ N = \mathbb{N}$, that is, $ \ (x_n) \in G^{\mathbb{N}} \, $, with $ \ B_E \left( x_n , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Note that $ \ \frac{2R \lVert x \rVert_E - \alpha}{\alpha - s} > 0 \, $. Since $\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded, the set $ \ J = \Big\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \ : \ n > \frac{2R \lVert x \rVert_E - \alpha}{\alpha - s} \Big\} \ $ is nonempty. Off course we have that $ \ 0 \notin J$. Since $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered, there exists the least element (minimum) of $J$, say $ \ j = \min(J)$, with $ \ j \in J$, that is, $j > \frac{2R \lVert x \rVert_E - \alpha}{\alpha - s} > 0 \, $. Thus $ \ m=j-1 \in \mathbb{N} \ $ and $ \ j = m+1 \in \mathbb{N}^*$. By the minimality of $j$ we have either $ \ m \notin J \ \Rightarrow \ m \leq \frac{2R \lVert x \rVert_E - \alpha}{\alpha - s} \, $. Therefore $ \ \lVert x_m \rVert_E = \frac{\alpha + m(\alpha - s)}{2R} \leq \lVert x \rVert_E < \frac{\alpha + (m+1)(\alpha - s)}{2R} = \lVert x_{m+1} \rVert_E \ $ and we are left with $ \ \lVert x_m \rVert_E = \frac{\alpha + m(\alpha - s)}{2R} \leq \lVert x \rVert_E < \frac{\alpha + (m+1)(\alpha - s)}{2R} = \frac{\alpha + m(\alpha - s)}{2R} + \frac{\alpha - s}{2R} = \lVert x_{m} \rVert_E + \frac{\alpha - s}{2R} \ $, that is, $ \ \lVert x_m \rVert_E \leq \lVert x \rVert_E < \lVert x_{m} \rVert_E + \frac{\alpha - s}{2R} \ $. Then $ \ \lVert x - x_m \rVert_E \leq \big| \lVert x \rVert_E - \lVert x_m \rVert_E \big| < \frac{\alpha - s}{2R} \ $, wich implies $ \ x \in B_E \left( x_m , \frac{\alpha - s}{R} \right) \subset G \ \Rightarrow \ x \in G$. As $x$ was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that $ \ G=E$. Let $ \ T \in \mathcal{C} \ $ and $ \ y \in im(T)$. There exists $ \ x \in E \ $ such that $ \ y = T(x)$. But $ \ x \in E = G = \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{C}} A^{-1} \big[ B_F (0_F , \alpha) \big] \subset T^{-1} \big[ B_F (0_F , \alpha) \big] \ $ and we have that $ \ y = T(x) \in B_F(0_F, \alpha)$. Then $ \ im(T) \subset B_F (0_F , \alpha) \ $ and $ \, im(T) \, $ is a bounded vector subspace of $F$. Hence $ \ im(T) = \{ 0_F \} \ \Rightarrow \ T = 0_L \, $. Therefore we have that $ \ \mathcal{C} = \{ 0_L \}$, a contradiction. Is there anything wrong with this reasoning? Are my calculation steps correct? If it is right, then we cannot have $ \ \alpha \neq s \ $ and we are left with $ \ s= \alpha \, $. That is exactly the case which I was not able to handle. Like always, any hint is appreciated.

It seems to me that the method above would suggest computing $(12/13)^{13} = 0.3532\ldots$ This cannot be right, though; the modified question is essentially asking about derangements for a set of $13$ elements. Checking the derangement sequence at OEIS yields as its thirteenth term $2290792932$ ; among the $13!$ combinations, this would yield a probability of winning the modified game equal to $2290792932/13! = 0.3678\ldots$ The numbers are not very different, but they are certainly different. Back to the main question: Is the solution for the ""Riddler Express"" above incorrect? [I strongly believe it is...] If so: What is the correct solution, and how does one show this? I had thought it would require a modification of the derangement formula using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle or some such thing (cf. this MO answer from Richard Stanley).

2089588,Number of discrete functions such that $f(f(f(x)))=x$,"The problem is: For $f:X\rightarrow X$, where $X$ has $n$ distinct elements, how many different $f$ exist that meet $f(f(f(x)))=x$ for all $x\in X$? I can calculate for small number of $n$'s by the following way (for example, $n=8$): case-1) $f$ is an identity function ($f(x)=x$) for all $x$. case-2) $f$ is an identity function for 5 elements in $X$ and for the rest of 3, it is cyclic, i.e. $f(a)=b,f(b)=c,f(c)=a$. case-3) $f$ is an identity function for 2 elements in $X$ and for the rest of 6, it can be divided into two groups of each having 3, and each groups are cyclic. As there are only two different ways of being cyclic (1,2,3 or 1,3,2), the number of functions for $n=8$ can be calculated as: $$1+\binom85\cdot2+\binom82\binom63\frac12\cdot2^2=1233$$ I could also generalize it for any $n$ as: $$n=3m+p\quad (p=0,1,2)$$

2089725,Why is my Cauchy Distribution going way larger than 1?,"I believe my answer to be simple but I will explain as I cannot figure it out. I am writing a simulation for an optical experiment.  I have a very small square plate target of dimentions $W \times W$.  I want to set up a laser linewidth that has a center wavelength of $0.1W$ and a half-width-half-maximum of $0.002W$.  I am assuming that the bandwidth of the laser follows a Cauchy distribution, which has the following form: \begin{equation}
P(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\gamma}{(\lambda-\lambda_0)^2+\gamma^2}
\end{equation} where $\lambda_0$ is the center wavelength, which is equal to $0.1W$, and $\gamma$ is the half-width-half-maximum, equal to $0.002W$. So my goal is to try to leave actual dimensions out of this and keep everything as ratios in relation to $W$.  If I plug in my parameters I get: \begin{align}
P(\lambda) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{0.002W}{(\lambda-0.1W)^2+(0.002)^2W^2} \\
& \frac{1}{\pi W}\frac{0.002}{(\frac{\lambda}{W}-0.1)^2+(0.002)^2}
\end{align} So as you can see, by virtue of the $1/(\pi W)$ term, I am left with an equation that forces me to use a value for $W$, instead of a ratio of $W$.  I don't think this is correct because the value for $W$ will be on the order of micrometers, which will make $P(\lambda)$ blow up.  Not to mention that the actual function part is never less than 1 because the input parameters are less than 1 and get smaller when squared. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?

2089898,Very accurate approximations for $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n}{a^n-1}$ and $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n^{2m+1}}{e^n-1}$,"Apologies if this has been asked before, since it seems rather simple. I enjoy messing around with formal mathematics, and I once derived the following formula which holds for many functions (see my question here ; no-one has yet responded to my request for criteria describing for which $q(x)$ it holds): $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}q(n)=\int_{0}^{\infty}q(s)ds-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{k}q^{[k-1]}(0)}{k!}\tag{*}$$ where $B_n$ are the Bernoulli numbers . Using this formula with $q(x)=\frac{x}{e^x-1}$ and the identities $\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}=\Gamma(s)\zeta(s)$ and $\frac{x}{e^x-1}=\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_n}{n!}x^n$, it was easy to show (since $\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{n}{e^n-1}}=0$) that: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{e^n-1}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}-1-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_n B_{n+1}}{n!(n+1)!}$$ But the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero past $n=3$ so that we get: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{e^n-1}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}-\frac{11}{24}\tag{1}$$ Now this is very accurate indeed; Wolfram Alpha declares the error to be on the order of $10^{-16}$. Further, using $(*)$ for $q(x)=\frac{x^{2m+1}}{e^x-1}$ in a similar manner gives: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^{2m+1}}{e^n-1}=\Gamma(2m+2)\zeta(2m+2)-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{B_n B_{2m+n+1}}{n!(2m+n+1)!}$$ which simplifies to: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^{2m+1}}{e^n-1}=(2m+1)!\zeta(2m+2)+\frac{B_{2m+2}}{2(2m+2)!}\tag{2}$$ For $m=1$ this gives: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^3}{e^n-1}=\frac{\pi^4}{15}-\frac{1}{1440}$$ which Wolfram Alpha declares to have an error on the order of $10^{-3}$. The $m=2$ case appears to also have an error on the order of $10^{-3}$. If we use $q(x)=\frac{bx}{e^{bx}-1}$ in $(*)$ and then set $b=\ln{a}$ then I think we get the following purported identity: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{a^n-1}=\frac{\pi^2}{6(\ln{a})^2}-\frac{1}{2\ln{a}}+\frac{1}{24}\tag{3}$$ The accuracy of $(3)$ appears extremely good; e.g. for $a=2$ it is $10^{-16}$ , for $a=3$ it is $10^{-15}$ , and for $a=6$ it is still $10^{-9}$ . All of this makes me believe that these formula are not exactly correct, but their accuracy amazes me. I don't know if what's going on in this question has any relevance here. My questions are: Can anyone confirm that all of the highlighted expressions are in fact only approximations, or are some of them actually correct?

[duplicate],"This question already has answers here : If the sum of two i.i.d. random variables is normal, must the variables themselves be normal? (2 answers) Closed 3 months ago . It's a rather elementary fact that a sum of two independent normally distributed random variables $X$ and $Y$ is normally distributed (or, if you will, the convolution of two normal densities is a normal density). To what extent does this go the other way around? It seems that is $X$ and $Y$ are independent and $X$ is normally distributed, then $Y$ is normally distributed or constant. If you drop both independence of $X$ and $Y$ and $X$ being normally distributed, it's pretty easy to e.g. take $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $Y = 1(X \geq 0)$ and consider $U=XY$, $V=X \,1(Y = 0)$. Now neither $U$ or $V$ are normally distributed but $U+V = X$. However, if you require $X$ and $Y$ to be independent, but drop the requirement of $X$ being normally distributed, it's seems more difficult. Is there a counterexample in that case, where $X$ and $Y$ are not normally distributed but $X+Y$ is?","['probability', 'normal-distribution', 'probability-distributions']"

For example, the sequence $[0,1,2,3,4]$ is given. We have to find the smallest number $N$, such that $\sqrt{N}-\lfloor\sqrt{N}\rfloor$ begins with $[0,1,2,3,4]$. The number $\sqrt{388}-\lfloor\sqrt{388}\rfloor$ has continued fraction $[0,1,2,3,4,12,1,\cdots]$ , so $N=388$ is a possible number (In this case, it is the smallest possible number). The existence of a number $N$ follows from the fact that the sequence $\sqrt{2}\cdot n$ , when $n$ runs over the positive integers which are not a square, is equidistributed modulo $1$, so every rational number in the range $[0,1]$ can be approximated arbitary close, hence the continued fraction will begin with a given sequence. But I have no idea how to find a possible number (and even better, the smallest possible number) efficiently. Any ideas ?","['number-theory', 'continued-fractions', 'sequences-and-series']"

2090600,Find the Frenet Frame at each point of the curve,"Compute the Frenet Frame at each point of the curve $c(t)=(3t-t^3,3t^2,3t+t^3)$ I first found $c'(t)=(3-3t^2,6t,3+3t^2)$ and checked for arc length parameterization but $||c'(t)||=\sqrt{9-6t^4+9t^4+36t^2+9+6t^2+9t^4}=\sqrt{18+36t^2+18t^4}\neq0$ Therefore I tried to follow a similar example to solve. So $c'(t)=(3−3t2,6t,3+3t2)$ $c''(t)=(-6t,6,6t)$ $c'''(t)=(-6,0,6)$ Then using Gram-Schmidt $T=\frac{c'(t)}{||c'(t)||}=(\frac{\sqrt2(1-t^2)}{2(t^2+1)}, \frac{\sqrt2t}{(t^2+1)}, \frac{\sqrt2}{2})$ Now using GS, as a Frenet Curve implies linear indepence, I would presume: $N=\frac{c''(t)}{||c''(t)||}$ however I can't get my answers to match those in the book. $||c''(t)||=\sqrt{36t^2+36+36t^2}=\sqrt{72t^2+36}=6\sqrt{2t^2+1}$ Therefore I would get: $\frac{-6t}{6\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{-t}{\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{-t\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1}$ $\frac{6}{6\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1}$ $\frac{6t}{6\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{t}{\sqrt{2t^2+1}}=\frac{t\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1}$ So $N=(\frac{-t\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1}, \frac{\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1}, \frac{t\sqrt{2t^2+1}}{2t^2+1})$ However my book gives: $N=(\frac{-2t}{t^2+1}, \frac{1-t^2}{t^2+1}, 0)$ Any help please, preferably solving using the same method I have began to use!","['arc-length', 'tangent-line', 'frenet-frame', 'parametrization', 'differential-geometry']"
2090602,Using Borel Cantelli Lemma,"I am currently working on the following problem: Suppose that $X_n$ are independent identically distributed random variables from a unit exponential distribution (so $P(X_n \leq x) = 1 - e^{-x}$, for $x \geq 0$). Let $M_n = \text{max}\{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$. Then the question is to find a sequence $u_n \rightarrow \infty$ such that $P(M_n \geq u_n$, infinitely often$) = 0$. I have the result that if $u_n \rightarrow \infty$ is any monotone increasing sequence, then $P(M_n \geq un$, infinitely often$) = P(X_n \geq u_n$, infinitely often$)$. I am attempting to work through this problem using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, specifically the result that if $\sum_n P(X_n \geq u_n$, infinitely often$) < \infty$ then $P(X_n \geq u_n$, infinitely often$) = 0$. However, I can only calculate $P(X_n \leq x)$ (and therefore also $P(X > x)$), so in the end all I can conclude is that $P(X_n > u_n$, infinitely often$) = 0$. My question is, how can I use the information I have been given to produce a result for $P(X_n \geq 0$, infinitely often$)$?

2090668,"What is the pmf $f$ of a random variable $X$ if it satisfies$f(x)=\frac{\alpha+\beta x}{x}f(x-1)$ for $x=1,2...$?","The actual textbook question: An integer valued random variable $X$ has p.m.f. $f$ satisfying $$f(x)=\frac{\alpha+\beta x}{x}f(x-1)\quad...(*),\quad\beta \ne1\quad\text{and}\quad x=1,2,...$$Find $\mu,\mathrm{Var}(X)$ and $\mathrm{MD}_{\mu}$ where $\mu=\mathrm{E}(X)$. While this problem was solvable by cross-multiplying the recursive equation of $f$ and summing up both sides for all possible $x$ to find the required moments, I wasn't able to find out the exact closed-form expression for $f$. I realise that we don't need the exact expression to find the required quantities, but is it possible to solve for $f$ from the given relation? The source adds that the binomial and Poisson random variables are of this type. Putting the values of $x$ in $(*)$ for a finite number of times from $x=1$ to $x=n$ and multiplying the $n$ equations I get, $$f(n)=\frac{f(0)}{n!}(\alpha+\beta)(a+2\beta)...(a+n\beta)$$ Then I could perhaps write $\displaystyle f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)=\frac{f(0)}{n!}\lim_{n\to\infty}p_n$, (say). Applying the AM-GM inequality on $p_n$, I could again possibly say that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}p_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\alpha+\frac{\beta (n+1)}{2}\right]^n,\quad\text{which diverges}.$$ I don't think using $\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}f(x)=1$ helps me out here.","['statistics', 'probability', 'random-variables', 'probability-distributions']"

a_n=\lceil 970\cdot1.025^{n}\rceil.

I guess $b_n$ should be as well rounded to the next integer divisibly by $5$, but i do not see the explict definition. It should have something to do with $a_n$, or at least with $970$. $b$ is growing on average relativly faster than $a$ until $n\approx 40$ then slower. How can i find $b$ without trial and error? Would it be helpful to have different examples for the sequences $a$ and $b$? I mean $a'$ with $a'_0=510$ generates a sequence $b'$ with $b'_0=55$ and $a''$ with $a''_0=700$ generates a sequence $b''$ with $b''_0=70$. I can list about the first $30$ members of those sequences as well. edit: something is not right with my formulas if $f_n=0$, but it should always mean ""round to the next integer divisibly by $5$"".","['data-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'ceiling-and-floor-functions']"
