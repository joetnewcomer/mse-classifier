265714,Riesz representation and vector-valued functions,"A version of the Riesz Representation Theorem says that a continuous linear functional on the space of continuous real-valued mappings on a compact metric space, $C(X)$, can be identified with a signed Borel measure on the set $X$. Are there any similar results when we replace $C(X)$ by the space of continuous functions of $X$ (compact metric) into $Y$ when (1) $Y=R^N$ or in general (2) $Y$ is a Banach space? I suspect the answer is yes, but I would like to find the right reference to start looking at. Thanks.","['riesz-representation-theorem', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis']"

265724,New subgroup has twice the size of the old one?,"While going through my class notes, I came across a statement I copied down from the board that I don't quite understand. The statement is this: Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$.  Suppose that $g \in G$ but $ g \notin H$, and that $g$ has order $2$ in $G$, and moreover $gHg^{-1} = H$. Then if $|H| = n$, the subgroup of $G$ generated by $H$ and $g$ has size $2n$. I'm trying to do this on my own by showing that the only cosets of $H$ in $\langle g,H \rangle$ are $H$ and $gH$, and I guess the condition that $g$ has order $2$ tells us we don't get any extra cosets of the form $g^nH$, but I'm not seeing how to use the condition that $g$ conjugates $H$ into itself to show that there are no other cosets.

265765,Method of Exhaustion applied to Parabolic Segment in Apostol's Calculus,"In section I1.3 of Apostol's Calculus (2nd Ed., Vol. 1, pages 3 to 7), Apostol details how to apply the method of exhaustion to a the parabolic segment of $x^{2}$. I understand the process of applying the , however I'm not sure how he proceeds from a certain step to another. In particular, it is the step in which he introduces the inequality necessary to proceed to single out $b^3 \over 3$ as the value of the area of the parabolic segment. I've attempted to provide as much context as possible below so that reference to the book isn't necessary. So in his explanation, he employs the method of exhaustion on the parabolic segment of $x^2$ from $x=0$ to $x=b$ with outer rectangles and inner rectangles, also known and upper and lower rectangles in other books. The area of the lower rectangles is: $$ S_{inner}= {b^3 \over n^3}[1^{2}+2^{2}+...+(n-1)^{2}] $$ $$ S_{outer}= {b^3 \over n^3}[1^{2}+2^{2}+...+n^{2}] $$ He then says that calculating the sum of the squares is inconvenient, and introduces the identity: $$ (I.3) \ 1^{2}+2^{2}+...+n^{2} = {n^3 \over 3}+{n^2 \over 2}+{\frac n6}$$ and says that for the summation of squares from $1$ to $(n-1)$: $$ (I.4) \ 1^{2}+2^{2}+...+(n-1)^{2} = {n^3 \over 3}-{n^2 \over 2}+{\frac n6}$$ He says, ""For our purposes, we do not need the exact expressions given in the right-hand members of (I.3) and (I.4). All we need are the two inequalities: $$1^{2}+2^{2}+...+(n-1)^{2} < {n^{3} \over 3} < 1^{2}+2^{2}+...+n^{2}$$ What I don't understand is where he obtained the idea to use ${n^{3} \over 3}$ in the inequality, from the expressions I've provided above. It seems to me that he used his prior knowledge of the value of the area to continue the proof, which leaves the reader wondering where he got the value from. He could have also used the following valid inequality: $$1^{2}+2^{2}+...+(n-1)^{2} < {n^{3} \over 3}+ \frac n6 < 1^{2}+2^{2}+...+n^{2}$$ This is true if you simply remove the $n^2 \over 2$ term in I.3 and I.4 above. But he instead chose to use the first inequality. If there is a reason for why, I'd like to know. Finally, and this is certainly pedantic on my part, I'd like to note that I think his proof of the area of a parabolic segment is inappropriately named the method of exhaustion. Isn't the reason Archimedes' method of analysis was heralded as ahead of its time is because he used the notion of the limiting process (albeit indirectly)? When I first encountered this method, the values of the inner and outer rectangles I provided above were subjected to the limiting process which results in the area under the parabolic segment. That seems more akin to the process with which Archimedes approached the problem (which was simply adding more and more triangles to fill in the empty space between the circle, and the polygon inscribed in the circle).","['inequality', 'geometry', 'summation', 'calculus']"

The cost of transporting his herd to Thrinacia was one ounce of gold per animal with all shiploads being equal. His gold was in large circular discs with a hole one unit in diameter at the center. Each disc was uniform in thickness and all had the same weight, but they varied widely in diameter. He divided the discs into concentric rings having whole numbers for their weights and inside and outside diameters. A successive outer and inner ring from any disc would pay for each shipload. One-half of the weight of the outer fifteen rings was in the outer six. Again dividing the outer six, leaves the outer five balancing the next six. How many discs were there, to use the last disc of gold? How many animals per load, and how many loads, if the number of discs is a triangular number, the number per load is a square number, and the number of loads is a product of a pentagonal number, a square number, a triangular number and of a cubic number? s/s Eratosthenes For an allegedly classical problem, it is surprisingly obscure.

$$ 0 = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i v_i + \sum_{j=m+1}^r b_j u_j + \sum_{k=r+1}^s c_k w_k

265972,When is Hardy's inequality a strict inequality?,"Let $1<p<\infty$, $f\in L^{p}(0,\infty)$ and $$F(x)=\frac{1}{x}\int^{x}_{0}f(t)dt$$ Hardy's inequality states $$|F|_{p}\leq \frac{p}{p-1}|f|_{p}$$ To show the bound is sharp Rudin suggested to use $f(x)=x^{-1/p}$ on $[1,A]$ and $0$ otherwise. Then let $A$ be arbitrally large. But I am at loss how to show this rigorously. So we have $F(x)=\frac{1}{x}\int^{x}_{1}\frac{1}{t^{1/p}}dt$ for $A\ge x\ge 1$, for $x<1$ this is $0$. For $x> A$ we have $$F(x)=\frac{1}{x}\int^{A}_{1}\frac{1}{t^{1/p}}dt$$ To fixed the formula we have $$
\int^{x}_{1}\frac{1}{t^{1/p}}dt=\frac{p}{p-1}t^{\frac{p-1}{p}}|^{x}_{1}=\frac{p}{p-1}(x^{\frac{p-1}{p}}-1)
$$ Putting together we have $$|F|_{p}=(\int_{1}^{A}F^{p}+\int_{A}^{\infty}F^{p})^{1/p}$$ and the first half is $$C\int^{A}_{0}\frac{1}{x^{p}}(x^{\frac{p-1}{p}}-1)^{p}=C\int^{A}_{1}(x^{-1/p}-1/x)^{p}$$ here $C=(\frac{p}{p-1})^{p}$. The second half is $$C \cdot D^{p} \cdot \int_A^\infty \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx  = C \cdot \frac{1}{p-1} \cdot A \cdot \left(A^{-\frac{1}{p}}- \frac{1}{A} \right)^p$$ where $D=(A^{\frac{p-1}{p}}-1)$. But now I do not know how to evaluate $$\int^{A}_{1} (x^{-1/p}-1/x)^{p}$$ though it is clear that $x^{-1/p}\ge \frac{1}{x}$ and hence this can be bound from above by $\log[A]$. If we ignore the second part, then first part of the integral is less than $$\frac{p}{p-1}\log[A]^{1/p}$$ whereas the right hand side $$\frac{p}{p-1}|f|_{p}=\frac{p}{p-1}(\int^{A}_{1}\frac{1}{x})^{1/p}=\frac{p}{p-1}\log[A]^{1/p}$$ But this ignored the second part. So I am wondering how to fix it. What I want to show after fixing all the constants is $$[\int^{A}_{1}(x^{-1/p}-1/x)^{p}]+\frac{1}{p-1} \cdot A \cdot \left(A^{-\frac{1}{p}}- \frac{1}{A} \right)^p)\le \log[A]$$ 
Now since $A$ is very large the $\frac{1}{A}$ factor is small. So the left hand side become $$[\int^{A}_{1}(x^{-1/p}-1/x)^{p}]+\frac{K}{p-1}\le \log[A]$$ where $K$ is some constant that can be arbitrally close to 1 as we select $A$.

266475,Uniqueness of Haar Measures,"Haar measure on a LCA (locally compact abelian) group $G$ is said to be unique ... up to a scaling factor. This is not as elegant as it might be expected because this requires a choice of a unit volume on $G$, in particular when we want to compute a Fourier transform. However, I have noticed something interesting in the special case where $G = E$ is a finite-dimensional real vector space. In this case you can define a canonical pseudoscalar-valued Haar measure instead of a scalar-valued one. This way, the transform of $f \in \mathcal{L}_2(E,\mathbb{C})$ is now a function $\mathcal{F}f \in \mathcal{L}_2(E^*,\mathbb{C} \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Lambda^{max}E)$. As $\Lambda^{max}E$ is one-dimensional, $(\mathbb{C} \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Lambda^{max}E) \otimes_\mathbb{R} \Lambda^{max}E^*$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$ which allows the inverse Fourier transform to seamlessly go back to $\mathcal{L}_2(E,\mathbb{C})$. Of course $\Lambda^{max}G$ is not defined for a general LCA group $G$. One might consider the exterior algebra of $G$ considered as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module. However, I don't think it is possible to define a good notion of ""pseudoscalars"" this way as there is no good notion of dimension on modules. So my question is: does anybody know if such an extension exists?","['haar-measure', 'measure-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'locally-compact-groups']"

Fix a Fréchet differentiable map of Banach spaces $g: X \to B$. Assume that, at a point $x_0 \in X$ where $g(x_0) = 0$, the derivative $Dg$ is Fredholm and surjective, so in particular the index of $Dg$ is the dimension of its kernel. A typical place this might arise is in solving PDEs, where $g$ is given by some nice differential operator and $x_0$ is some generic solution to the PDE. I want to prove: The moduli space $\{x \in X \,  | \, g(x) = 0\}$ has a smooth chart near $x_0$ of dimension $index(Dg)$. I know this is supposed to be a consequence of the implicit function theorem for Frechet maps, which I understand. I also understand the proof of the submersion theorem for finite-dimensional manifolds, which is simply an application of the implicit function theorem in finite dimensions. I am trying, in essence, to prove the above result the same way one would prove the finite-dimensional submersion theorem. However, I'm having difficulty proving a version of the submersion theorem in the infinite-dimensional setting. I'll describe my approach here -- I suspect that maybe I'm trying to use the implicit function theorem in the wrong way. Defining the finite-dimensional vector space $Y = kernel(Dg)$ and the Banach space $Z = B \times Y$, if one can choose a splitting map $\pi: X \to Y$ , one can define a map
$$F: X \times Y \to Z$$
given by 
$$F(x,y) = (g(x), \pi(x) - y).$$
Then the implicit function theorem obviously gives a parametrization of the set $\{x \, | \, g(x) = 0\}$ near $x_0$, in terms of an open set in $Y$. The splitting map $\pi$ always exists when $X, B$ are finite dimensional, but my question is: can such a splitting always be chosen when $X, B$ are infinite-dimensional? And if not, how can I prove the main result above ? I'm trying to follow the finite-dimensional analogies, perhaps too naively, and failing.
