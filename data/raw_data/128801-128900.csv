1983324,Verify identity: $\sin(x+1)\sin(x+1) - \sin(x+2)\sin x = \sin^2(1)$,"I have the following identity to verify:

$$(\sin x \cos(1) + \cos x \sin(1))^2 - (\sin x \cos(2) + \cos x \sin(2))(\sin x) = \sin^2(1). $$ I don't want to just ask ""how i do dis"" and expect an answer.

1983378,Inequality between standardized cumulants: $\rho_4\geq\rho_3^2-2$,"Suppose that $X$ is a random varible with moments $\mu_1'$, $\mu_2'$, $\mu_3'$, $\mu_4'$ and central moments $\mu_1=0$, $\mu_2=\text{Var}(X)$, $\mu_3$ and $\mu_4$. Define the cumulants
\begin{aligned}
k_1&=\mu_1',\\
k_2&=\mu_2'-(\mu_1')^2=\mu_2,\\
k_3&=\mu_3'-3\mu_1'\mu_2'+2(\mu_1')^3=\mu_3,\\
k_4&=\mu_4'-4\mu_1'\mu_3-3(\mu_2')^2+12(\mu_1')^2\mu_2'-6(\mu_1')^4=\mu_4-3\mu_2^2,
\end{aligned}
and standardized cumulants $\rho_r=\frac{k_r}{k_2^{r/2}}$. My text mentions the following inequality in passing
$$
\rho_4\geq\rho_3^2-2.
$$
I can prove this particular one but the text has a few others. What is a source of statements and proofs for similar inequalities? My proof (please share if you have a different one): the required inequality is equivalent to 
$$
\frac{k_4}{k_2^2}\geq\frac{k_3^2}{k_2^3}-2\iff k_2k_4\geq k_3^2-2k_2^3.
$$
Then I express $k$'s in terms of the $\mu$'s to rewrite the inequality as
$$
k_2k_4\geq k_3^2-2k_2^3\iff\mu_2(\mu_4-3\mu_2^2)\geq\mu_3^2-3\mu_2^3\iff\mu_2\mu_4\geq\mu_3^2.
$$
But the last inequality is true thanks to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
$$
\mu_3^2=E[(X-\mu_1')(X-\mu_1')^2]^2\leq E[(X-\mu_1')^2]E[(X-\mu_1')^4]=\mu_2\mu_4.

1983439,Proving that $p = \inf\{\|Ax-b\|: x\in\mathbb{R}^n\}$ is attained,"I'm trying to solve the following problem in my textbook: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix of unspecified rank, $b\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $p =\inf\{\|Ax-b\|: x\in\mathbb{R}^n\}$ (the norm is abitrary on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ). Show that this infimum is attained (meaning, proving the existence of an $x$ for which $\|Ax-b\| = p$ ). I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to exactly prove this. In the problems chapter, I have been introduced to ""Least-squares problems"", which is the first thing I thought of. The problem is that the least-square method uses a specific norm (problem uses an abitrary) and also assumes that the rank is $n$ , and thereby $n\le m$ (problem has unspecified rank). Another thought was to introduce $b'$ , with property $\|b'-b\|=p$ , and then prove that a solution to $Ax=b'$ exists — but as far as I know, that would again depend on the actual rank of $A$ , and I'm not too sure that this is the correct way to proceed.

1983442,Help with a minimum-distance permutation problem,"Given an ascendantly ordered non-negative real number sequence $X=x_1,...,x_n$, and another non-negative sequence $Y=y_1,...,y_n$, let $P$ denote all permutations of $Y$.

Define $d(X,Y_p)=|y_{i_1}-x_1|+...+|y_{i_n}-x_n|$, and let $d^*=\min_{p\in P}{d(X,Y_p)}$. The question is Is $d^*=d(X,Y_{p_0})$, i.e. is the minimum distance between $X,Y_p$ is the distance between the ordered $X$ and ordered $Y$? If not, can you give a counterexample? For example, suppose
$X=1,2,3,4$, $Y=9,7,8,0$, then $d(X,Y_0)=d((1,2,3,4),(0,7,8,9))$. It seems that this is the minimum distance over all permutations of $Y$. Thank you!","['combinatorics', 'optimization']"

1983494,Conditions for uniform convergence in probability under reciprocal map.,"I am dealing with a real-valued random function $\sigma_n(\theta)$, where $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$ is a parameter. I know that $$
\sigma_n(\theta) \overset{p}{\rightarrow} \sigma(\theta),

$$
1/\sigma_n(\theta) \overset{p}{\rightarrow} 1/\sigma(\theta)
$$
as well, but not uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$, because the reciprocal function is not uniformly continuous. My question is, given that $1/x$ is uniformly continuous on $x\in[\mu, \infty)$, with $\mu > 0$, if I impose something like
$$
\text{Prob}\{\sigma_n(\theta)<\mu\}\rightarrow 0,\;\;\; \text{as} \;\;

for any $\theta$, will this be sufficient to get uniform convergence in probability? If the answer is negative, what kind of conditions should I impose?","['uniform-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'continuity', 'uniform-continuity', 'convergence-divergence']"
1983497,Max norm inequality with normal random vector,"Let $X,Y\in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\ge 1$. Also $X\sim N(0, \Sigma)$ and $Y$ (general r.v.) has zero mean and the same variance $\Sigma$. I'm looking for the following bound: $$
\mathbb{E}\|X\|_{\infty}^r\le C_{d,r}\mathbb{E}\|Y\|_{\infty}^r

1983780,How to solve for a complex triangle,"There was this problem given in a math textbook: A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. What is the area of the triangle? Well, as any good geometry math student can see, there is an error with the way the question was worded – the person who made this question just pulled the numbers out of thin air and created a seemingly simple problem. For most students the answer would be $A=\frac12bh=30$, right? Well, if we were to place the hypotenuse between $(-5, 0)$ and $(5, 0)$ and make it a diameter of a radius-5 circle, the 90° angle of the third vertex would need to be on the circumference on the circle, as any right-angled triangle needs to fit inside a half circle. But as can be seen, the largest height to a circle of this kind is the radius – 5 in this case, not 6 as stated in the question! So, since the formula for the area still holds true, is there any way I can  determine the coordinates of the triangle, given that they must contain complex numbers?
Many have suggested complex analysis. One suggested the alternate formula $A=\frac12ab\sin\theta$, which in this case yielded $25\sin\theta$. Then using Euler's relationship
$$\sin\theta=\sin\left(\frac\pi2-i\ln \frac{6+\sqrt{11}}5\right)=\frac65$$
The third vertex would then be $(i\sqrt{11},6)$. OK, this makes sense, but… I have no idea of how he gets here!! Can someone give me a simple step-by-step on how this is arrived at?","['complex-analysis', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"
1983837,A question about André Weil’s converse to Haar’s Theorem on the existence of Haar measures,"Let $ (G,\cdot,e) $ be a group, and suppose that there are a $ \sigma $-ring $ \Sigma $ on $ G $ and a measure $ \mu: \Sigma \to [0,\infty] $, non-trivial, such that the following properties hold: $ \Sigma $ is left-invariant w.r.t. $ \cdot $, i.e., $ x \cdot S \in \Sigma $
for every $ x \in G $ and $ S \in \Sigma $. $ \mu $ is left-invariant w.r.t. $ \cdot $, i.e., $ \mu(x \cdot S) = \mu(S) $
for every $ x \in G $ and $ S \in \Sigma $. The map
$
  \left\{ \begin{matrix}
  G \times G & \to & G \times G \\ (x,y) & \mapsto & (x,x \cdot y)
  \end{matrix} \right\}
  $ is $ (\Sigma \times \Sigma,\Sigma \times \Sigma) $-measurable. For each $ x \in G \setminus \{ e \} $, there exists an $ S \in \Sigma $ with
$$
  0 < \mu(S) < \infty \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  0 < \mu((x \cdot S) \triangle S) < \infty,
  $$
where $ \triangle $ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. Then Weil’s converse to Haar’s Theorem states that there exists a topological group $ ((G',\bullet,e),\tau) $ with the following properties: $ \tau $ is a locally compact and Hausdorff group topology on $ G' $. $ (G,\cdot,e) $ is a subgroup of $ (G',\bullet,e) $, so that $ G \subseteq G' $
and $ \cdot = \bullet|_{G \times G} $. If $ \mathscr{B} $ denotes the $ \sigma $-ring on $ G' $ generated by the
$ G_{\delta} $ compact (w.r.t. $ \tau $) subsets of $ G' $, then
$$
  \{ B \cap G \in \mathcal{P}(G) \mid B \in \mathscr{B} \} \subseteq \Sigma.
  $$ Note: We call $ \mathscr{B} $ the $ \tau $-induced Baire $ \sigma $-ring
on $ G' $ . There exists a (Baire) Haar measure $ \mu': \mathscr{B} \to [0,\infty] $,
associated with $ ((G',\bullet,e),\tau) $, such that
$$
  \forall B \in \mathscr{B}: \qquad
  \mu(B \cap G) = \mu'(B).
  $$
This implies that $ G $ is a $ \mu' $-thick subset of $ G' $, as
$ B \in \mathscr{B} $ and $ B \cap G = \varnothing $ imply $ \mu'(B) = 0 $. The version of Weil’s result presented here is taken from Halmos’s Measure Theory , which is rather antiquated but still remains a classic. Now, I would like to determine if one can simply replace every instance of ‘$ \sigma $-ring’ by ‘$ \sigma $-algebra’, as well as replace all Baire $ \sigma $-rings by Borel $ \sigma $-algebras, i.e., $ \sigma $-algebras on a set that are generated by a given locally compact and Hausdorff topology.

1983885,Rational function approximation to square root,"I've already received a lot of help with this problem (thank you all), and I've written up an answer with all of the information I've got in it as to why these approximations are so good. My question is why the following rational function is such a good approximation for the square root of $x$? $$\sqrt{x}\approx\frac{256+1792x+1120 x^{2}+112 x^{3}+x^{4}}{1024+1792x+448 x^{2}+16 x^{3}}$$ The following image illustrates that for $3\leqslant x\leqslant 7$ the two curves are almost identical: More generally why does the following formula hold with such accuracy?: $$\sqrt{n}\approx\frac{m^{8}+28 m^{6}n+70 m^{4}n^{2}+28 m^{2}n^{3}+n^{4}}{8 m^{7}+56 m^{5}n+56m^{3}n^{2}+8m n^{3}}$$ for any real number ( not just integer) $n\geqslant 1$ and: $$m=\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{4n-3}}{2}\right\rfloor$$ The following graph shows that for $0\leqslant n\leqslant10000$ the two curves cannot be separated by eye: And this is the logarithm of the error in that approximation which decreases cyclically (presumably due to the floor in the definition of $m$) but then starts to become slightly less accurate stepwise as $n$ increases: ( Edit : Several people have mentioned Pade approximants below and that the first formula is a Pade approximant, which explains why it is such a good approximation. I would really especially like to know why the second formula is such a good approximation on the wide range I have shown in the second graph (is it related to Pade approximants also?), and I would really love to know why the process I outline in the section below of how I got these functions gives Pade approximants at all from ratios of binomial coefficients . At first glance, it seems as if there might be something deep going on here?) How I found these and what I already know: While messing around with maths once I noticed that $(3+\sqrt{8})^{8}\approx1331714$ with very good accuracy. Since the binomial theorem gives that $(3+\sqrt{8})^{8}=665857+235416\sqrt{8}$ and since $1331714=2\times665857$ I saw that that gave the approximation: $$\sqrt{8}\approx\frac{665857}{235416}$$ which is quite accurate. I found this intriguing, but exploring further I found that similar near integer results were produced by: $$(1+\sqrt{2})^{8}\approx1154$$ $$(2+\sqrt{3})^{8}\approx37634$$ $$(2+\sqrt{4})^{8}=65536$$ $$(2+\sqrt{5})^{8}\approx103682$$ $$(2+\sqrt{6})^{8}\approx153632$$ $$(3+\sqrt{7})^{8}\approx1032224$$ and so on, and I found that in general I could get a very accurate near integer from any (at least small) expression of the form $(m+\sqrt{n})^{8}$ where as $n$ increased over the integers $m$ increased as: $$m=\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{4n-3}}{2}\right\rfloor$$ When these expressions were expanded out they were all in the form $a+b\sqrt{n}\approx2a$ where: $$a=m^{8}+28 m^{6}n+70 m^{4}n^{2}+28 m^{2}n^{3}+n^{4}$$ $$b=8 m^{7}+56 m^{5}n+56m^{3}n^{2}+8m n^{3}$$ From this you get my original equations that I posted. Now there is nothing particularly interesting about the eighth powers I have been working with; ninth powers work as well (slightly more accurately) and seventh powers are slightly less accurate, giving a similar formula: $$\sqrt{n}\approx\frac{m^{7}+21 m^{5}n+35 m^{3} n^{2}+7m n^{3}}{7 m^{6}n+35 m^{4} n^{2}+21 m^{2} n^{3}+n^{4}}$$ Thus some of the reason behind these formulae must be the fact that the $m+\sqrt{n}$ have powers tending to integers, and just about the only thing I have been able to find out about why this might work is that some of these numbers are Pisot-Vijayaraghavan numbers (i.e. their powers tend towards integers). However, this does not explain the phenomenon, since I do not know why the effect would be greatest for $m=\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{4n-3}}{2}\right\rfloor$ or importantly why the convergence should be of the form $(m+\sqrt{n})^{c}=a+b\sqrt{n}\approx 2a$ (which is where the approximation comes from) or why the formula derived should also hold for non-integral $n$. Rather the important part seems to lie in the formulation as: $$\left(\frac{Even Binomial Terms}{Odd Binomial Terms}\right)^{\pm 1}$$ and perhaps in the expression $m=\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{4n-3}}{2}\right\rfloor$. So my question is: why do these formulae work?","['elementary-functions', 'real-analysis', 'binomial-coefficients', 'algebra-precalculus', 'approximation']"

Here's what I have tried so far: Lemma. A graph $G$ is 2-connected if and only if every two vertices are contained in a cycle. Attempt: Let $e_1=\{v_1,v_2\}$, $e_2=\{w_1,w_2\}$ be two edges of $G$. By lemma, there is a cycle $C_1$ containing $v_1,w_1$ and a cycle $C_2$ containing $v_2,w_2$. Denote the two paths from $v_1$ to $w_1$ in $C_1$ as $p_1$ and $p_2$ and similarly set $r_1$, $r_2$ for the two paths in $C_2$. Then divide the problem into different cases: Case 1: Neither $p_1$ nor $p_2$ intersects $r_1$ or $r_2$. Case 2: Only one of $p_1$ and $p_2$ intersects $r_1$ or $r_2$. Case 3: Both intersect $r_1$ or $r_2$. For the first two cases it is easy to show that such cycle exists by just picking one path from each $C_1$ and $C_2$. But the third case is a lot complicated so I believe there should be a much nicer way to approach this problem. Any idea?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1984124,Can bundles be trivial if the structure group is not?,"I am confused about a basic concept and any help to clear up my misunderstanding is appreciated: In https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0611201 , for example, it is stated that a fibre bundle is trivial if and only if all transition functions can be chosen to be identity maps. If this is not the case, the fibres are ‘twisted’  in a way that the bundle  cannot be simply described by a product manifold. This non-trivial aspect is encoded in a non-trivial structure group S of the bundle. As a first example often the struture group of the  Mobius strip versus a cylinder  is discussed. So far so good! My confusion arises when considering a principle bundle $ P= P(M,G) $ over some base manifold $M$ where the fibre $G$ is the structured group $S$ itself, e.g. $G \simeq S $. This is because I can choose $M \simeq \mathbb{R^4}$ which makes the fibre bundle trivial no matter how ""complicated"" one chooses $G$ (because  $\mathbb{R^4}$ can be contracted to a point). This seems like a contradiction to me. Furthermore image I start out with  $ P= P(M,G) $ and systematically ""test out"" different base manifolds $M$ while keeping $G$ fixed. Now as soon as the topology of $M$ changes ( say $M$ cannot be contracted to a point unlike before) one needs to expects the structure group of the bundle to change as well; but it was fixed to be $G$ in the first place? How can this be? One way out I see if one replaces $G \simeq S $ by $G \supseteq S$ requiring that the structured group only needs to be a subset of $G$. So in the trivial case from before $ P = P(\mathbb{R^4},G)$ the structured group would only pick out the trivial sub-group $S=\{e\}$ from G. However even in this case, in my second example of ""testing out"" different base-manifolds for a given $G$, which theorem guarantees me that one always stays within $G \supseteq S$ for an arbitrary choice of $M$? many thanks!","['principal-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

If you put 1 black ball in one bucket and all the other balls in the other bucket then you will maximise the probability of picking a black ball, since there is a 50% chance of picking either bucket, so the probability becomes $$P(B)=(0.5\times1)+\Big(0.5\times \frac{49}{99}\Big)=0.75=75\%.$$ How can this be expressed mathematically?

Said this, my analysis has been to see the behavior in time for $g(t)$ and $Ric(t)$, then $t$ tends to $\infty$ and $- \infty$, but I want that 
the metric $g(t)$  remain positive. a) Then for $t \rightarrow \infty$, to ensure that $g(t)$ is positive, I fixed $x=0$ and $y=0$ and I get $g(t)$ tends to $\infty$ and $Ric(t)$ tends to $-2$ b) While for $t \rightarrow - \infty$  I get $g(t)$ tends to $0$ and $Ric(t)$ tends again to $-2$. For $t=0$, I get $g_0= \frac{dx^2+dy^2}{1-x^2-y^2}$ and with a simple calculations, I found that the 1-parameter family of diffeomorfism is $\phi_t=(e^{2t}x, e^{2t}y)$.

Suppose that whenever $A_i$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal A$ that decreases to $\emptyset$, then $\lim_n \mu(A_n)=0$. Prove that $\mu$ is a measure. Here's my proof: it suffices to prove that for disjoint $A_i$ in $\mathcal A$, $\mu(\cup_i A_i) =\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_i)$. Let $n\in \mathbb N$. Since $\mu$ is finitely additive, $$\mu(\cup_i A_i) = \mu(\cup_{i=1}^nA_i) +\mu(\cup_{i=n+1}^{\infty}A_i)= \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(A_i)+\mu(\cup_{i=n+1}^{\infty}A_i)$$ $\left(\cup_{i=n+1}^{\infty}A_i\right)$ is a sequence of sets indexed by $n$  that decreases to  $\emptyset$ (essentially because the $A_i$ are disjoint). Hence $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty} \mu(\cup_{i=n+1}^{\infty}A_i) =0$. Therefore $\mu(\cup_i A_i)  = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)$.

  meromorphic functions which at each point are ""no worse"" than the meromorphic map $\frac{1}{z^{n_x}}$. In other words we find the dimension of the vector space of meromorphic functions with order of poles bounded from above and orders of zeros bounded from below at each point.

1984577,Equivalent form of prime number theorem,"In the book The elementary proof of Prime Number Theorem it says that The prime number theorem $\psi (x)\sim x$ is equivalent to $\int_1^\infty \frac{\psi (t)-t}{t^2} =-\gamma -1$, where $\psi (x)=\sum_{n\le x} \Lambda (n)$, $\gamma $ is the Euler constant. The book also gives a hint to prove $\sum_{n\le x}\frac{\Lambda (n)}{n}=\int_1^x \frac{\psi(t)}{t^2} dt+\frac{\psi (x)}{x}$ first, but I have no idea on how to prove this hint or prove the original equivalence. All I know now is the formula in this question $\sum_{n\le x}\frac{\Lambda (n)}{n}=\ln x-\gamma +o(1)$ which is exactly another form of prime number theorem and the relation $\psi (x)=x-1+o(x)-\gamma -\int_1^x o(t)dt$ proved before in the book.

1984587,"Max and min eigenvalues of the ""normalized"" adjacency matrix of a path","Setup : Let $A$ be the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix of a path with $n$ nodes, so the $ij^\text{th}$ element of $A$ is $a_{ij} = 1(|i-j|=1)$.  I.e. the elements just off the main diagonal are $1$, and everything else is $0$. Now define $B$ as equal to $A$, but with row sums normalized to equal $1$.  I.e., $b_{ij} = a_{ij} / a_{i+}$, where $a_{i+}$ is the $i^\text{th}$ row sum of $A$.  Here are the matrices: $$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0&1 \\
  1&0&1&& \mathbf 0 \\
  &1&0& \ddots \\
  &&\ddots&\ddots &1& \\
  & \mathbf 0&&1&0&1 \\

  &&&&1&0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$ Note that the 1st and last rows have 1 non-zero element (since the nodes at the ends of the path have only 1 neighbor), while the middle rows have two non-zero elements (since the middle nodes have a neighbor on each side). My question : Can you prove that the max and min eigenvalues of $B$ are $1$ and $-1$, respectively, for any $n \ge 2$?  I've checked that this is true (with a computer program) for all $n$ from 2 to 500.  So I'm pretty confident that it's true in general, but I'm wondering if there's a proof. Context: The reason I care about this is that $B$ appears in a statistical model I'm using (a CAR spatial model), and the max and min eigenvalues of $B$ determine the parameter space for a parameter in the model. This is clearly closely related to the following asked-and-answered question: Computing eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a path . There they wanted all eigenvalues of $A$, whereas I want the max and min eigenvalues of $B$. Also, although this might not be helpful, here's a plot of all $n$ eigenvalues of $B$, for $n = 2,\ldots,16$.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'adjacency-matrix', 'spectral-graph-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

I have already shown that $$x^2+y^2-1 = (x+a)(x-a)+(y+b)(y-b) $$ because $p\in (a,b) \implies a^2 + b^2 -1=0,$ and I have also already shown ( see p.2 here ) that: $$\mp/\mp^2 = \{ f_1(a,b)(x-a) + f_2(a,b)(y-b): f_1, f_2 \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]/\langle x^2 + y^2 -1 \rangle  \} $$ However, this is not of the form I want, and thus not one-dimensional (I think), unless $f_1(a,b)=f_2(a,b)$, and I am completely at a loss for how to show this. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? This is Exercise 4.14.8, p. 238 of Algebraic-Geometry: A Problem-Solving Approach by Garrity et al. This isn't homework, I'm just stuck on this problem, which is the second-to-last problem of the section, and I want to move on to the next section. EDIT: The calculation done here says that the dimension of $\mp/\mp^2$ for an analogous hypersurface is two-dimensional -- in fact, if one replaces $\bar{x}$ with $x-a$ and $\bar{y}$ with $y-b$ everywhere, it looks almost exactly the same as my work calculating $\mp/\mp^2$, except that at the end the author is able to conclude that $\mp/\mp^2 \simeq (k \cdot \bar{x} \oplus k \cdot \bar{y} \oplus \langle \bar{x}^2, \bar{x}\bar{y}, \bar{y}^2 \rangle)/\langle \bar{x}^2, \bar{x}\bar{y}, \bar{y}^2 \rangle \simeq k\cdot x \oplus k \cdot y$ which is supposed to be two-dimensional. In contrast, the authors of my book (4.15.3 on p.240) state that the dimension of any irreducible smooth hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is $n-1$, and that the dimension of the tangent space (and thus of the cotangent space) agrees with the dimension at all smooth points. And $x^2 + y^2 -1$ is a non-degenerate conic section, hence smooth. Is the hypersurface defined by $xy - x^6 - y^6$ singular at $(0,0)$? Otherwise I have no idea how to explain the discrepancy. The formula at the bottom of the first page here is almost certainly relevant -- I am still figuring out how to apply it in this instance.","['polynomials', 'algebraic-geometry', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals', 'commutative-algebra', 'ideals']"

I find it interesting but stumbled to get what he meant in his hint. The Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality for an absolutely integrable function $f$ reads: $$ m(\{Mf(x)\geq \lambda\}) \leq \frac{C_d}{\lambda}\int_\mathbb{R^{d}}|f(t)|dt, $$ where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure, $\lambda>0$ and $Mf(x)$ is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Using a Vitali type of covering lemma one can show the constant can be $3^d$ . The exercise asks to improve this to $2^d$ , by noticing that $2$ -scaled balls cover the centers. Terry hinted that one need to do some $\epsilon$ adjustment. However, I failed to see why and how can small adjustments to $2$ -scaled balls (or perhaps something else) can still lead to a sufficient cover, given that choice of covering balls seems to be fixed.

Using the inequality 
$$ \| [x_n ] \|_{X/Y} \leq \| x \|_X $$
we obtain that sequence $ ([x_n])$ is Cauchy in $X/Y$. Next step, that I cant make would be to prove that it is not convergent, or that this allows us to construct non-convergent Cauchy sequence.

The Questions A farmer wishes to employ apple pickers during harvest time. Each picker can harvest $625$ apples per hour and is paid $\$6$ per hour. In addition, the farmer must pay a supervisor $\$10$ per hour and the union $\$10$ for each picker employed. Finally, if $v$ apples are picked, then a service charge of $\$\frac{50,000}{\sqrt{v}}$ is levied against the farmer. a. Briefly explain why the levy charge of $\$\frac{50,000}{\sqrt{v}}$ motivates the farmer to hire an adequate number of pickers. b. Set up a function which represents the farmer's total cost. c. Find the number of apple pickers which should be employed to minimize the farmer's cost. d. Find the number of apples which would be picked at this minimum cost. My Answers a . The levy charge motivates the farmer to hire an adequate number of pickers because as the number of apples picked increases, the amount of the service charge decreases. b. Where $p$ is the number of pickers and $h$ is the number of hours,
$$C = 6ph + 10h + 10p + \frac{50,000}{\sqrt{v}}$$

est une surface développable, fabriquée avec un patron de tétraèdre en arrondissant les arêtes... "" Also refer to the Coin Conic page. Suppose that the material is inextensible, and that a grid of directrices and orthogonal circles is marked on the cone/cylinder,
then it is clear that upon pinching the directrices will not appear straight. 
Since a developable surface implies that it be ruled, then either the ruling lines have moved, or the surface has undergone some deformation. Therefore the question is: Can the calippo (and bottom of toothpaste, and milk) package be a ruled developable surface , in case, admitting that the shape of the pinched edge be not exactly linear ?
or is some deformation of the material demanded ? ---- P.S:  ----- Thanks to the answer, with expressive sketch, received by Rahul , complemented with that provided by C.Blatter to the previous post , we can conclude that such a surface is a plausible model. So, scaling all the dimensions to have the base circle of radius $1$, height $=h$ and length of the pitch $=2c$ we can parametrise the surface as
$$
\eqalign{
  & {\bf q} = \left( {sc,\;0,h} \right) - \left( {\cos \alpha ,\;\sin \alpha ,0} \right) = \left( {sc - \cos \alpha ,\; - \sin \alpha ,h} \right)  \cr 
  & {\bf p} = \left( {\cos \alpha ,\;\sin \alpha ,0} \right) + t\,{\bf q} \cr} 
$$
where
$$
\left\{ \matrix{
  \alpha  =  - \pi /2\quad  - 1 < s < 1\quad 0 \le t \le 1 \hfill \cr 
   - \pi /2 < \alpha  < \pi /2\quad s = 1\quad 0 \le t \le 1 \hfill \cr

  \pi /2 < \alpha  < 3\pi /2\quad s =  - 1\quad 0 \le t \le 1 \hfill \cr}  \right.
$$ Then we can develop half of the surface as indicated, by putting for the flattened conic part that
$$

1985357,Do we need the axiom of choice to prove L'Hopital's rule?,"I was looking over an honors-calculus proof of L'Hopital's rule today, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The proof states that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continuous on $[a,b]$; differentiable on $(a,b)$; $\lim_{x\to a^+} \tfrac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$ exists; and that $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+} g(x) = 0$. WLOG, we may assume that $f(a)=g(a)=0$. It then proceeds by saying that for any given $x\in(a,b)$, $\;f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,x]$ and differentiable on $(a,x)$. Therefore by the Cauchy mean value theorem there must exist a number $\alpha_x\in(a,x)$ for which $$
 \frac{f'(\alpha_x)}{g'(\alpha_x)} = \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{g(x)-g(a)} = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}.
$$ From here we can define a function $\alpha:(a,b)\to(a,b)$ given by $x\mapsto\alpha_x$. Hence, $a<\alpha(x)<x$ for all $x\in(a,b)$, and $\lim_{x\to a^+}\alpha(x) = a$. From here L'Hopital's follows since $$
\lim_{x\to a^+} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a^+}\frac{f'(\alpha(x))}{g'(\alpha(x))} = L.
$$ The only issue I have with this proof is the idea of choice involved with this function $\alpha(x)$. The Cauchy mean value theorem (which comes from Rolle's theorem, which in turn comes from the extreme value theorem) is not a constructive proof. It only implies that such an $\alpha_x\in(a,x)$ exists; and says nothing to the effect of how one would find such a value, considering there might be more than one such number in $(a,x)$ that satisfies the condition. So in this way, are we forced to appeal to the (full?) Axiom of Choice , to properly define our function, and thus to prove L'Hopital's rule?

In particular, does this hold even if $X$ can take negative as well as positive values? Say $X$ has pdf $f_X$. Using the series expansion of $e$ we have,

1985863,Why don't we define arclength via intrinsic polygonal approximation?,"I'm taking a first course in differential geometry and want to make sure I really understand every definition. I know the modern definition(s) of manifolds arose (at least in part) from the desire to eliminate reference to embeddings in Euclidean space, but I'm going to try and go along with the course anyway. A curve was not defined, but a parametrized curve was defined to be a continuous map $\gamma:[a,b]\to \mathbb R^3$. Then, the arclength of a parametrized curve was defined to be the supremum over all partitions of $[a,b]$ of polygonal approximations of the image of $\gamma$.
If we assume $\gamma$ is $C^1$, some calculus leads to the convenient integral formula which coincides with a physicist's intuition and all is well. However, the object of geometric interest here is really the image $A$ of $\gamma$, and the above is not ""just"" a polygonal approximation - we're taking a partition of the interval $[a,b]$ and then letting $\gamma$ pick the points on its image from which we construct the polygonal approximation. Given a drawing of a curve on a piece of paper one would simply pick some points on it and start connecting them - without any parametrization. This way one is led to define the approximate length of $A$ with respect to a choice of finite points $\mathcal C$ as $\ell(A,\mathcal C)=\sum_{x_i\in \mathcal C}\|x_i-x_{i-1}\|$ and the to define $$\ell (A)=\sup_\mathcal{C} \left\{ \ell (A,\mathcal C ) \right\}.$$ This looks much more obvious and intrinsic. It's also reminiscent of Lebesgue measure, except we're not approximating by covers but by polygonal lines. The value of this supremum seems the identical to the classic definition, but I wonder, why isn't this one used? I think the reason is that parametrized curves basically give access to ""physics"" i.e we can integrate speed to get distance, but I just want to make sure.","['curves', 'arc-length', 'differential-geometry', 'definition']"

This can easily be proven by taking the derivative of both sides. You then get $\frac{d}{dx}\int_{}^{} f(x)^n dx = f(x)^n$ and $\frac{d}{dx}\int_{}^{f(x)} x^n(f^{-1}(x))' dx = \frac{f(x)^nf'(x)}{f'(f^{-1}(f(x)))} = f(x)^n$. Since $(f^{-1}(x))' = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$. This can be used to find hard integrals like $\int \tan(x)^3 dx$. $n=3$, $f(x) = \tan(x)$, $f^{-1}(x) = \arctan(x)$ and $(f^{-1}(x))' = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$ $$ \int_{}^{} \tan(x)^3 dx = \int_{}^{\tan(x)} \frac{x^3}{1+x^2} dx= \int_{}^{\tan(x)} x-\frac{x}{1+x^2} dx = [\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-\ln(1+x^2)\right)]^{\tan(x)} = $$
$$ \frac{1}{2}\left(\tan(x)^2 - \ln(1+\tan(x)^2)\right) + C $$ I have never seen this trick before, so I was quite amazed when I saw how powerful it could be. Solving higher exponents of $\tan(x)$ was not a big challenge. Let's take a new example. $n=1$, $f(x) = \arccos(x)$, $f^{-1}(x) = \cos(x)$ and $(f^{-1}(x))' = -\sin(x)$. $$ \int \arccos(x) dx = \int_{}^{\arccos(x)} -x\sin(x) dx = [x\cos(x)-\sin(x)]^{\arccos(x)} =$$ $$ x\arccos(x) - \sin(\arccos(x))+C = $$ $$ x\arccos(x) - \sqrt{1-x^2} + C$$ So I don't have a question, just wanted to show it to you.

One would say you could assign a number to every finite set, and a cardinality for an infinite set. So the range would be clear, the set of cardinal numbers. But what about the domain, here we get a few problems. This should be the set of all sets, yet this concept isn't allowed in mathematics as it leads to paradoxes like Russell's paradox. So how do we formalize the notion of 'cardinality'? It seems to behave like a function that maps sets into cardinal numbers, but you can't define it this way as that definition would be based on a paradoxical notion. Even if we only restrict ourselves to finite sets the problem pops up, as we could define the set {A} for every set, thereby showing a one-to-one correspondence between 'the set of all sets' (that doesn't exist) and the 'set of all sets with one element'.
