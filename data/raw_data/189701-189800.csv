3562011,Equivalence of two harmonic problems on different domains,"I want to solve \begin{cases}
\Delta u = 0,&\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B_1(0) \\
u=0,&\text{ as }\Vert x\Vert\rightarrow +\infty \\
u=1,&\text{ on }\partial B_1(0).
\end{cases} I know that the solution to this problem is $$
\bar{u}(x) = \Vert x\Vert^{-1}.
$$ My question is if by solving the following BVP \begin{cases}
\Delta v = 0,&\text{ in }B_R(0)\setminus B_1(0) \\
v=\bar{u}|_{\partial B_R},&\text{ on }\partial B_R(0)\\
v=1,&\text{ on } \partial B_1(0),
\end{cases} $R>1$ , I get a solution $v$ which is the restriction of the solution $u$ of the original problem onto the new domain $\Omega = B_R(0)\setminus B_1(0)$ . Namely, if $v = u|_{\Omega}$ . I am claiming this because : If I set $D = \big(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B_1(0)\big)\cap \big(B_R(0)\setminus B_1(0)\big)$ I can define a third problem over $D$ which is solved by $w=u-v$ on $D$ : \begin{cases}
\Delta w = 0,&\text{in }D \\
w = 1-1=0,&\text{on }\partial B_1(0) \\
w = \bar{u}|_{\partial B_R(0)}-\bar{u}|_{\partial B_R(0)}=0,&\text{on }\partial B_R(0)
\end{cases} so by maximum principle I can conclude that $$
0=\min_{x\in \partial D} w \leq w(y) \leq \max_{x\in \partial D} w = 0
$$ for any $y\in D$ and hence that $w=u-v\equiv 0$ .","['harmonic-functions', 'elliptic-equations', 'linear-pde', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
3562017,What is the size of the marked area (calculate without computer)?,"Recently I scribbled a representation of squares which should challenge the imagination of the infiniteness of the sum $$s_1=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+...$$ and of the finiteness of the sum $$s_2=1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}+...$$ The following picture puts together the infinite length of a line constructed of the partial series of $s_1$ (using the length unit ""cm"" for example) and the finite area constructed of the partial series of $s_2$ (in ""cm²"") which is enclosed by a border of infinite length: Ok, I mean this picture gives a nice composition (of a finite area limited by an infinite line) for some interesting amateur. After that, I thought: what if I smooth that figure by connecting the edges of the squares with straight lines? What is the size of the newly introduced area (yellow)? Is a purely geometrical solution possible? Challenge1: find a formula for the yellow area without the use of a computer. I think I needed about an hour to find the (very nice) solution with pen&paper (feeling a bit rusty needing such a long time... ). Challenge2: If the edges are connected with a smooth interpolating curve instead of straight pieces - what could be a formula with the target of simpleness and of straightness of the curve? (If I got the terminology correct, the ideal were a ""absolute monotonous"" function, see wikipedia .) As a ""poor man's approach"" I thought one might rotate the picture by 45 deg first towards the x-axis. Then the new area could be expressed by the integral for the curve's formula. Give such an integral and the area. My first approach was to ""generalize"" the formula for polynomial interpolation using the heights of the upper edges (when the diagonal of the figure is rotated to the x-axis) towards an infinite number of interpolation-points; one problem with this is that the x-coordinates of the interpolation-points are not equidistant. (I've no solution so far, possibly one can employ the $\psi()$ -function as interpolation of the harmonic numbers.)","['recreational-mathematics', 'real-analysis']"

3562333,Finite intersection property for sets containing generating elements of derived subgroups of quotients,"What I need to prove is a consequence of the following theorem. Theorem A. Let $G$ be a finite $p$ -group and suppose that its derived subgroup $G'$ is generated by 2 elements. Then there exists $x\in G$ s.t. $$ K_x(G):=\{[x,g]\mid g\in G \}=G'. $$ Now let $G$ be a pro- $p$ group whose derived subgroup is topologically generated by 2 elements. Define for any open normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ the set $$X_N:=\{x\in G\mid K_{xN}(G/N)=(G/N)'\}. $$ Notice that since $G$ is pro- $p$ , every open normal subgroup of $G$ has finite index, therefore we can apply Theorem A to $G/N$ and conclude that $X_N\ne \emptyset$ for all $N\trianglelefteq_o G$ . What I need to prove is that the family $\{X_N\}_{N\trianglelefteq_o G}$ has the finite intersection property. My guess is that we can take two any open normal subgroups $N$ , $M$ of $G$ , consider their product $NM$ which is still normal and open (since their product is equal to the union of cosets of an open subgroup) and prove that $$X_N\cap X_M \supseteq X_{NM}.$$ Since $NM\trianglelefteq_o G$ , $X_{NM}$ would be non-empty and the statement would be proved. All of this comes from here (at page 2 you can find Theorem A, as well as Theorem B whose proof, at page 11, is what I'm interested in). Notice that the author says that it's clear that $\{X_N\}_{N\trianglelefteq_o G}$ has the finite intersection property, so there could be an easier way to prove that.","['pro-p-groups', 'group-theory', 'p-groups', 'topological-groups']"

3562597,Fourier Transform and Dihedral Group,"While preparing for a calculus exam we noticed that the Group generated by the Fourier transform and complex conjugation, as a subset of the operators on the Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}$ of rapidly decaying smooth functions $f:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb C$ , is isomorphic to the Dihedral group $D_4$ of order 8. For $f \in \mathcal{S}$ define $$ \hat f := Ff := (2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \exp(-ixy) f(y)dy$$ where $xy$ is the standard scalar product of $x$ and $y$ .
We already know that $F$ is a bijection on $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ \check f := F^{-1}f = F^3 f = (2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \exp(ixy) f(y)dy$$ If we now define $G = \langle F, \bar\cdot \rangle$ , then $\mathrm{ord\:} F = 4$ and $\mathrm{ord\:}\bar\cdot = 2$ . For $f \in \mathcal{S}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we also get the equation \begin{align}
F\bar f(x) &=  (2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \exp(-ixy) \bar f(y)dy\\
&= (2\pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \overline{\exp(ixy) f(y)}dy\\
&=\overline{F^{-1}f}(x)
\end{align} So we also got the nessessary relation between the ""flip"" $\bar\cdot$ and ""rotation"" $F$ . Thus $G$ is isomorphic to $D_4$ . If we furthermore define $$ \tilde f(x) := \overline{f(-x)} = \overline{F^2f}(x)$$ we get some helpful equations (please excuse the abuse of notation) $$\hat{\bar f} = \bar{\check f} = \tilde{\hat f} = \check{\tilde f}$$ $$\bar{\hat f} = \check{\bar f} = \hat{\tilde f} = \tilde{\check f}$$ From $G\cong D_4$ it follows that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ is the center of $G$ and the Hasse diagram of the lattice of subgroups of $G$ looks like this https://i.sstatic.net/zssSG.png .

3563265,Every injection $f: A \to A$ for finite $A$ is surjective [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Surjectivity of $f:S\to S$ implies injectivity for finite $S$, and conversely (3 answers) Can it be shown that a set X is infinite if and only if there exists some $F:X\to X$ that is an injection but not a surjection? (2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I cannot prove this rather simple theorem in set theory. Let $A$ be a finite set. If $f: A \to A$ is injective, then $f$ is also surjective. My Attempt. Suppose for contradiction that this isnt the case. So there exists a mapping $f: A \to A$ that is not surjective. Then the image of $A$ under $f$ is a proper subset of $A$ , i.e., $\text{Im}(f) = C$ , where $C \subsetneq A$ . Define the mapping $g: C \to A$ , where $c \mapsto f^{-1} (\{c\})$ . By construction, $g$ is not onto, but since $f$ is injective, it is well-defined, since every $c \in C$ has a unique preimage in $A$ . Hence, every $c$ is sent to exactly one $a \in A$ . But, if that is the case, $|C| = |A|$ , as a function is by definition defined on its entire domain. With this contradiction, we conclude that no such function $f$ can exist.","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"
3563304,Algebraic varieties : How to calculate explicitly the ramification index?,"Again a question about algebraic varieties ! Actually, I followed to book of Silverman ""The Arithmetic of elliptic curve"", and I have several questions about ramification index. For $\phi : C_1 \to C_2$ a non constant map of smooth curves, and $P \in C_1$ , he's defining the ramification index of $\phi$ at $P$ as : $e_{\phi}(P) = \operatorname{ord}_{P}(\phi^*(t_{\phi(P)}))$ where $t_{\phi(P)}$ is a uniformizer at $\phi(P)$ . Then, we have a proposition among which we have the formula : $\forall Q \in C_2 \; \operatorname{deg}(\phi) = \sum_{P \in \phi^{-1}(Q)} e_{\phi}(P)$ . My problem is : how to explicitly calculate $\operatorname{deg}(\phi)$ using this formula. I mean, the author gives then an example : $\phi : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1 \; [X:Y] \mapsto [X^3(X-Y)^2:Y^5]$ , and he says that $\phi$ is unramified everywhere except on $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ where we find : $e_{\phi}([0:1]) = 3, e_{\phi}([1:1]) = 2$ . So, I tried to understand this example, but I'm stuck. Actually, I didn't first saw why it is unramified everywhere except on $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ , so I tried to understand what happens in $[0:1]$ and $[1:1]$ for example. If $Q=[a:b], \; b \neq 0$ , we have : $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1, Q}= k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})}$ with maximal ideal : $\mathcal{m}_q = (\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y}-\frac{a}{b})}$ . So, for $Q=[0:1]$ for instance, we have : $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1, Q}= k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y})}$ with maximal ideal : $(\frac{X}{Y})k[\frac{X}{Y}]_{(\frac{X}{Y})}$ , and a uniformizer is then given by $\frac{X}{Y}$ . But we have : $$ e_{\phi}([0:1]) = \operatorname{ord}_{[0:1]}(\frac{X}{Y} \circ [X^3(X-Y)^2 : Y^5]) = \operatorname{ord}_{[0:1]}(\frac{X^3}{Y^3}(X-Y)^2.\frac{1}{Y^2}) $$ which is not in the maximal ideal, but : $$ (\frac{X^3}{Y^5}(X-Y)^2)^2 = \frac{X^6}{Y^6}.\frac{(X-Y)^4}{Y^4} $$ seems to be on the ideal cause it's a quotient of polynomial of same degree of the form : $\frac{X}{Y} \times (*)$ . So, we find : $e_{\phi}([0:1]) = 2$ ? So, obviously I'm wrong somewhere, or there is something I didn't understood. And it's the same for the other one. So my first question is : where I'm wrong, and how to explictly determine the ramification index ? My second question is : if we know that $\phi : C_1 \to C_2$ is given by $[x:y] \mapsto [f_1(x) : 1]$ for example, and we know in some point $P$ $f_1$ as a pole of order $n$ fixed, and otherwise $f_1$ as neither a pole nor a zero. Can we conclude that : $deg(\phi)= - \operatorname{ord}_P(f_1)) = n$ and the same if we replace the pole by a zero ? Put an other way : is there a link between the pole and zeros of the rational functions defining the map and the degree of the map ?

3563327,$5$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathcal{A}_5$,"I know that the character table of $\mathcal{A}_5$ is the following: $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}

\chi_{2} & 3 & -1 & 0 & \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} & \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \end{array}$$ The standard representation is irreducible since the action of $\mathcal{A}_5$ on $\{1,\dots,5\}$ is doubly transitive. The last two characters can be computed by using the fact that $\mathcal{A}_5$ is isomorphic to the isometry group of the Icosahedron. My question is about the character $\gamma$ . I think this character can be found as follows: if $V$ denotes the standard representation, the symmetric square $S^2V$ has character $\chi_{S^2V}=(10,2,1,0,0)$ which satisfies $\Vert\chi_{S^2V}\Vert^2=3$ , so $S^2V$ is the sum of $3$ irreducible representations. Finally because $\langle \chi_{S^2V},\chi_{triv}\rangle=\langle \chi_{S^2V},\chi_{std}\rangle=1$ , we can define $$\gamma:=\chi_{S^2V}-\chi_{std}-\chi_{triv}.$$ I would like to construct $\gamma$ differently.
I know that there is an isomorphism $\varphi:\mathcal{A}_5\to\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ and we can use this and the fact that $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ acts doubly-transitively on the set of of lines in $\mathbb F_5^2$ , i.e. $\mathbb P^1(\mathbb F_5)$ which has $6$ elements, to create a $5$ -dimensional irreducible representation on $\mathcal{A}_5$ . Let's call this representation $(W,\rho_W)$ and $\gamma_W$ the character of this representation. If we already know the character table of $\mathcal A_5$ we can say that $\gamma_W$ is equal to $\gamma$ .
My question is: is it possible to compute $\gamma_W$ without using this fact ? Since the action of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ on $\mathbb P^1(\mathbb F_5)$ is faithful, the morphism $\rho_W:\mathcal A_5\to GL(W)$ is injective and the order of $\rho_W(g)$ and $g$ is the same, for $g\in\mathcal A_5$ , but I can't say more. I am a beginner in representation theory so please correct me if there is anything wrong in my reasoning. I just recall the lemma that I used several times: Lemma: If a finite group $G$ acts transitively on a finite set $X$ , then the permutation representation decomposes into $\Bbb CX = \operatorname{Vect}(e)\oplus V$ with $e:=\sum_{x\in X}x$ and $V:=\lbrace \sum_{x\in X}\lambda_x x~\vert~\sum_{x\in X}\lambda_x=0\rbrace$ and $\rho_V$ is irreducible if and only if the action of $G$ on $X$ is doubly-transitive.","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'characters']"

3563420,Places of an algebraic number field,"I have been doing my best to learn the rudiments of class field theory via the formulation in terms of ideals. The $\textbf{ray class group}$ of an algebraic number field $K$ with respect to $\mathfrak{m}$ is defined as: $$ \textrm{Cl}_{K}^{\mathfrak{m}}:=J^{\mathfrak{m}}/P^{\mathfrak{m}}.$$ I was initially under the erroneous impression that the ray class group is defined in terms of any ideal $\mathfrak{m} \subset \mathcal{O}_K$ , so that $J^{\mathfrak{m}}$ is the group of ideals in $\mathcal{O}_K$ coprime to $\mathfrak{m}$ and $P^{\mathfrak{m}}$ is the normal subgroup of prime ideals congruent to $1\ (\textrm{mod}\ \mathfrak{m})$ . $\textrm{Cl}_{K}^{\mathfrak{m}}$ would then be a generalisation of the ideal class group - coinciding with the latter when $\mathfrak{m}=1$ . After further elucidation, it turns out that the ray class group is actually defined in terms of something called a $\textbf{modulus}$ $\mathfrak{m}$ of $K$ , defined as: $$
\mathfrak{m} := \prod_{\mathfrak{p}}\mathfrak{p}^{\nu(\mathfrak{p})} \quad\textrm{where}\ \nu(\mathfrak{p}) \neq 0\ \textrm{for finitely many}\ \mathfrak{p}. \tag{$\dagger$}
$$ When I first saw ( $\dagger$ ), I thought to myself: Fair enough; the product is taken over all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{O}_K$ , so $\mathfrak{m}$ is just some ideal in $\mathcal{O}_K$ , and ""modulus"" is just fancy nomenclature. But upon closer inspection, it turns out that the modulus is not defined as a product of prime ideals, but rather in terms of something called the $\textbf{places}$ of $K$ . Thus I set out to find out exactly what is meant by the ""places"" of a number field $K$ . And in my quest to understand the notion of places, I have managed to find places in the literature where places are mentioned, but no comprehensive treatment or even a definition. As for the online resources, I have found them wanting in intelligibility and consistency. Most resources I have consulted treat something called Archimedean places, which they relate to the real and complex embeddings of the number field in question. Hence my questions - which may be somewhat soft - are the following: 1) Why is the ray class group defined in terms of these moduli, as opposed to ideals. $\textit{E.g.}$ if we defined it in terms of an ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ , would it still be true that every ray class group had a corresponding ray class field, $\textit{i.e.}$ a normal extension $E$ of $K$ , so that $\textrm{Cl}_{K}^{\mathfrak{m}} \cong \textrm{Gal}(E/K)$ . That is to say: Would we still have the Takagi existence theorem? 2) Where can I find a really thorough treatment of the notion of a place of a number field? 3) As with most things in mathematics, I believe that it is most instructive to confront a few concrete cases before one gives an abstract definition. So can we provide concrete instances of ""places"" of $\mathbb{Q}$ , of $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ or of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ ?","['algebraic-number-theory', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'ideals', 'class-field-theory']"

We say that the natural domain ""includes"" $[-1,0) \cup (0, \infty)$ because one might argue that -3 is also in the natural domain; every number, whether positive or negative, has a unique real cube root. (I don't think the footnote is relevant to my question.) I'm confused about the inclusion of -1 in the domain. Since $$ f(-1) = (1 + (-1))^{1/-1} = 0^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{0} , $$ isn't $f$ undefined at $x = -1$ ? Shouldn't the natural domain be $(-1,0) \cup (0, \infty)$ ?","['limits', 'functions']"

3564027,A formula of Ramanujan for $\cot\sqrt {w\alpha} \coth\sqrt{w\beta} $,"While trying to answer this question I stumbled on a paper by Bruce C. Berndt which contains the following formula by Ramanujan $$\frac{\pi}{2}\cot\sqrt{w\alpha}\coth\sqrt{w\beta}=\frac{1}{2w}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{m\alpha\coth m\alpha} {w+m^2\alpha} +\frac{m\beta\coth m\beta} {w-m^2\beta} \right) \tag{1}$$ which is supposed to hold for all positive numbers $\alpha, \beta$ with $\alpha\beta=\pi^2$ . Berndt mentions that this formula is wrong and missing a term. The corrected version stands as $$\frac{\pi}{2}\cot\sqrt{w\alpha}\coth\sqrt{w\beta}=\frac{1}{2w}+\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{\beta}{\alpha}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{m\alpha\coth m\alpha} {w+m^2\alpha} +\frac{m\beta\coth m\beta} {w-m^2\beta} \right) \tag{2}$$ for $\alpha>0<\beta,\alpha\beta=\pi^2$ . Bruce gives some references which contain a proof of the above formula or its equivalents. Bruce himself derives the above identity by using a change of variables in the following identity established by R. Sitaramchandrarao $$\pi^2xy\cot (\pi x) \coth (\pi y) =1+\frac{\pi^2}{3}(y^2-x^2)-2\pi xy\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{y^2\coth (\pi n x/y)} {n(n^2+y^2)}-\frac{x^2\coth(\pi n y/x)}{n(n^2-x^2)}\right) \tag{3}$$ Ramanujan gave a similar (but wrong) formula and Sitaramachandrarao fixed it to arrive at $(3)$ . The derivation of $(2)$ from $(3)$ is not that difficult. The RHS of $(3)$ is modified using the identities $$\frac{y^2} {n(n^2+y^2)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{n}{n^2+y^2},\frac{x^2}{n(n^2-x^2)}=\frac{n}{n^2-x^2}-\frac{1}{n}$$ and $$\coth z =1+\frac{2}{e^{2z}-1}$$ The derivation also involves a transformation formula for logarithm of Dedekind eta function. However the proof of $(3)$ is omitted in Berndt's paper. Unfortunately I have not been able to find those references online which contain a proof for $(2)$ or $(3)$ . It is also mentioned that the formula could be proved using Mittag-Leffler expansion but I am barely a novice in complex analysis. It is desirable to find a direct proof of the above result $(2)$ (or $(3)$ ) which avoids complex analytic methods.

There is a hint for $x^5-Nx+1$ : prove first that four of the roots in $\Bbb{C}$ has absolute values larger than $1$ . I think that it follows from Rouche's theorem, but I don't know how to proceed. Update: I think that both problems can be solved by direct computations. For example for the second one,  we can write $$x^5-Nx^2+1=(x^3+ax^2+bx+u)(x^2+cx+v)$$ where $|u|=|v|=1$ and $a,b,c\in \Bbb{Z}$ . Multiply out, consider the coefficient of $x^4$ we get $a+c=0$ . Consider $x$ we get $uc=-bv$ . Next consider $x^3$ we have $b+v+ac=0$ . Note that $c=-a$ and $|b|=|a|$ , so we can actually solve $a$ . Then a contradiction is easily reached. I think that the same method also applies to the first one. However, the first one can be solved by using the fact that only one root is in the unit circle. I am still wondering if there is a nicer method for the second one. Update 2: I got a solution from my professor. A similar method can also be applied to $x^5-Nx^2+1$ . By Rouche's theorem, there are exactly two roots inside the unit circle, and the key point here is these two roots are complex conjugates. Hence they have to be the two roots of $x^2+cx+v$ . Then the other three roots for $x^3+ax^2+bx+u$ are absolutely greater than one. The contradiction follows by Vieta's theorem.

Then any function $f: A \to A$ that is injective is also surjective. Proof. Let $f: A \to A$ be injective, where $A$ is a finite set. Define $C = \text{Im}(f)$ , where by definition $C \subset A$ . It suffices to show that $C = A$ . For every $c \in C$ , define $$g_c = f^{-1} (\{c\}),$$ the inverse image of the element $c$ under the map $f$ . Clearly, there exists a bijection $\alpha: \{g_c\} \to C$ given by $g_c \mapsto c$ . Furthermore, since $f$ is injective, for any $c$ , $|f^{-1} (\{c\})| = 1$ . Since $f$ is a total function on $A$ , for every $a \in A$ , there exists a unique $c \in C$ such that $f(a) = c$ . Hence, the preimage of every $c \in C$ must exhaust the domain of $A$ , so $$\bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) = A.$$ Set equality implies equality in cardinality, so $$\left \lvert \bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) \right \rvert = |A|.$$ As each of these sets $f^{-1} (\{c\})$ are disjoint (by injectivity of $f$ ), we can invoke finite additivity to write $$\left \lvert \bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) \right \rvert = \sum\limits_{c \in C} |f^{-1} (\{c\})| = |A|.$$ Since we deduced earlier that the set $\{g_c\}$ are in bijective correspondence with $|C|$ , we have $$\sum\limits_{c \in C} |f^{-1} (\{c\})| = \sum\limits_{c \in C} 1 = |C| \cdot 1 = |C|.$$ Hence, $$|C| = |A|.$$ Since $A$ and $C$ are finite sets, this implies that $C = A$ .

3564239,Implicit $AC$ in Munkres' Proof? (Completely Regular Spaces),"Recently, I have been reading Munkres' Topology. In Chapter $4$ , he presents a couple of proofs of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem and then, at the end of the section, generalizes one of them to an 'Imbedding Theorem' for completely regular spaces (Munkres' definition of completely regular includes the $T_0$ axiom): Theorem 34.2 (Imbedding theorem). Let $X$ be a space in which one-point sets are closed. Suppose that $\{f_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in J}$ is an indexed family of continuous functions $f_a: X\rightarrow \mathbb R$ satisfying the requirement that for each point $x_0$ of $X$ and each neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ , there is an index $\alpha$ such that $f_{\alpha}$ is positive at $x_0$ and vanishes outside $U$ . Then the function $F:X\rightarrow \mathbb R^J$ defined by $$F(x)=\left(f_{\alpha}(x)\right)_{\alpha\in J}$$ is an imbedding of $X$ in $\mathbb R^J$ . If $f_{\alpha}$ maps $X$ into $[0,1]$ for each $\alpha$ , then $F$ imbeds $X$ in $[0,1]^J$ . My question is this: does the proof of this theorem (the way Munkres outlines it above) implicitly rely on the Axiom of Choice or some weaker version? If the answer is ""a weaker version"" what is that version? Is the theorem itself equivalent to some well-known weaker version of $AC$ ? Elaboration: The essential parts of the proof - that $F$ is injective, continuous, and an open map, follow easily by simply plugging in $J$ in place of the index set in the first proof of the Urysohn Metrization Theorem Munkres presents. The thing that has been bothering upon a recent rereading of this proof is the construction of the ' $F$ ' used in the statement of the imbedding theorem itself. It seems like, implicitly, in constructing the function, ' $F$ ', we have used the truth of a statement that would look something like: If $Y$ is a set and $\{Z_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in J}$ is an indexed family of sets s.t. for each $\beta\in J$ , $\exists$ some $g_{\beta}: Y\rightarrow Z_{\beta}$ , then there exists a function: $$G:Y\rightarrow \prod_{\beta\in J} Z_{\beta}$$ defined by $$G=\left(g_{\beta}\right)_{\beta\in J}$$ But this statement looks like, at least to me, a version of the Axiom of Choice. For, with the truth of the Axiom of Choice, given such $Y$ , $\{Z_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in J}$ , and $\{g_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in J}$ , we may well-order the index set, $J$ , and then recursively define $\pi_{\beta}(G)=g_{\beta}$ (where $\pi_{\beta}$ denotes the $\beta$ th projection map). On the other, if the above statement were true, given any indexed family of nonempty sets, $\{X_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in J}$ , we have that, for each $\alpha$ , $\exists$ $f_{\alpha}: \{0\}\rightarrow X_{\alpha}$ (since each $X_{\alpha}$ is nonempty - I think this collection of functions should be well-defined). So, by the truth of the statement, there exists a map, $F:\{0\}\rightarrow \prod_{\alpha\in J} X_{\alpha}$ . But then $\prod_{\alpha\in J} X_{\alpha}$ must contain $F(0)$ , making $\prod_{\alpha\in J} X_{\alpha}$ nonempty. So the statement seems to imply the Axiom of Choice too, making it look like they are equivalent. I have to say, however, that I am not sure that the above implications are true. My set theory is rusty and I haven't found and cannot recall ever seeing the Axiom of Choice stated in this way, so I think there may be some flaw with my reasoning. So, my question is- well, first, if there is a flaw in my reasoning drawing an equivalence between the statement and $AC$ , please leave an answer explaining this- but beyond that, is the statement equivalent to maybe something weaker? If not, is there a way around the full $AC$ in the proof of the Imbedding theorem? I ask mostly because I am only really familiar with $AC$ appearing in topology as versions of the Tychonoff theorem, the connection with which, seems more intuitive.","['axiom-of-choice', 'general-topology']"

I believe that the rope just falls at $g\,ms^{-2}$ (ignoring any air resistance). But I have a line of logic that leads to something else and I do not know where the flaw in my logic lies! Could you please help me to find it? Here's the setup: The rope has total mass $M$ and full length $L$ . Its mass is uniform along its length. One end of it is held to a height of $x_0<L$ and released at time $t=0$ . The rope forms a pile on the ground of negligible height. I'm ignoring all resistive forces. As time passes, the tip of the rope is at distance $x(t)$ from the ground. The mass of the portion of the rope still falling is $\frac{x(t)}{L}M=:m(t)$ and the centre of mass of the falling portion of rope is at $\frac{1}{2}x(t)$ . The force of gravity on the falling portion of rope is $-m(t)g$ . This force will act at the rope's centre of mass. So, using Newton's Second Law, at the centre of mass: $$\begin{align}
-m(t)g &= \frac{d}{dt}\Big(m(t)\frac{d}{dt}\big(\frac{1}{2}x(t)\big)\Big) \\ \implies -\frac{M}{L}x(t)g &= \frac{M}{2L}\frac{d}{dt}\Big(x(t)\dot{x}(t)\Big) \\
\implies -gx(t) &= \frac{1}{2}\big(\dot{x}(t)^2 + x(t)\ddot{x}(t)\big)

I've tried looking up books on matrix calculus,  calculus on normed vector spaces and variational calculus but haven't found anything suitable (the closest option was Cartan's Differential Calculus , but I'd like something more concrete). Where do people learn this sort of thing?","['reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'matrix-calculus', 'linear-algebra']"
3565478,Creating a $4 \times 4$ square grid using $5$ pieces of $8$-inch wires,"We would like to create a $4$ -by- $4$ square grid using pieces of wire such that the sides of the squares are $1$ inch and we are not allowed to cut the wires. Is it possible to create the grid by using $5$ pieces of wire of length $8$ inch each? I know that this is not possible, but I am stuck at proving it. I think it is Euler tour related, and the grid itself should contain no Euler tour since there are more than $2$ vertices with odd number of degrees. Any hint on this problem?","['graph-theory', 'eulerian-path', 'hamiltonian-path', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3565479,invertible sheaves of the projective line,"I'm trying to do the following exercise: ""Consider the projective line $X=\mathbb{P}^1_R$ over a ring $R$ . Describe Serre's twisted sheaves $\mathcal{O}_X(n)$ , $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ , via Cech cocycles and show that there cannot exist any further invertible sheaves on $X$ , up to isomorphism."" For the first part I guess it's ok: $\mathcal{O}_X(n)$ correspond to the element of $\tilde{H}^1(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{O}_X(n))$ (with the covering $\mathcal{U}=(D_+(T_0),D_+(T_1))$ ) given by $\lambda_{i,j}=\left(\frac{T_j}{T_i}\right)^n$ . For the second part I can't get it: I take $\mathcal{L}$ corresponding to $(\overline{\eta_{\alpha,\beta}})\in\tilde{H}^1(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{O}_X(n))$ . We can suppose that the covering $\mathcal{V}$ is finer than $\mathcal{U}$ and is given by principal open sets $D_+(g_\alpha)$ with all $g_\alpha$ having the same degree (because $D+(g_\alpha)=D_+(g_\alpha^k)$ ) and $g_\alpha=T_{i(\alpha)}h_\alpha$ (because $\mathcal{V}$ is obtained by intersection with $\mathcal{U}$ and $D_+(T_i)\cap D_+(h_\alpha)=D_+(T_i h_\alpha)$ ). We have $\eta_{\alpha,\beta}\in\mathcal{O}_X(D_+(g_\alpha)\cap D_+(g_\beta))^*$ ie $\eta_{\alpha,\beta}\in R[T_0,T_1]_{(g_\alpha g_\beta)}^*$ ie $\eta_{\alpha,\beta}=\frac{h_{\alpha,\beta}}{(g_\alpha g_\beta)^q}$ . If I understand well we want $(\eta_{\alpha,\beta})\sim\left(\left( \frac{T_{i(\beta)}}{T_{i(\alpha)}} \right)^n  \right)$ for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ that is we want the existence of $f_\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_X(D_+ g_\alpha)^*=R[T_0,T_1]_{(g_\alpha)}^*$ with $$ \eta_{\alpha,\beta}\left( \frac{T_{i(\alpha)}}{T_{i(\beta)}} \right)^n=f_\beta f_\alpha^{-1} $$ I don't see how obtain that, the princpal problem is $h_{\alpha,\beta}$ . I would like to have $\eta_{\alpha,\beta}=\left(\frac{g_\beta}{g_\alpha}\right)^n$ but I'm not sure that all the inversible of $R[T_0,T_1]_{(g_\alpha g_\beta)}^*$ are of this form.","['graded-rings', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
3565490,Finding limit points and isolated points of a set,"I'm trying to solve the following problem: find limit points and isolated points of the following set: $$A=\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{E}^2: x=(-1)^n\frac{n}{n+1}, y=3, n\in \mathbb{N}\right\}$$ How should I proceed? I know that limit point is a point, that where if I put a sphere of arbitrary length, I should always get some point that belongs to the set. However, I fail to draw that function. (Still learning functions of two variables). How should I proceed without drawing the function? Thanks","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"
3565496,folding $2^n$ numbers,"A rectangular strip of paper 16 units long and 1 unit wide is divided into 16 unit squares. Starting at the left end of the strip, the integers from 1 to 16 are written in order, one in each square. The strip is then folded so that the right half completely covers the left half. This action is repeated until the strip is one unit long. At this point how squares are beneath the square that has 10 written on it?
  The order of folding 1-16 is: $$1\;2\;\;3\;4\;5\;6\;7\;8\;\;9\;10\;11\;12\;13\;14\;15\;16$$ 2 15 10 7 6 11 14 3 4 13 12 5 8 9 16 1 What is the pattern behind here? For the general case of any $2^n$ , folding in this way always result in 2 at the top and 1 at the bottom in the end - but what determines the order of the numbers in between?",['combinatorics']
3565558,Modular of subsets for a given value,"Let $S=\{1, 2, 3, ⋯, 1000\}$ and $A$ be a subset of $S$ . If the number of elements in $A$ is $201$ and their sum is a multiple of $5$ , then $A$ is called good. How many good As are there? My idea is bijection. The modular of subset has equal probability of $0,1,2,3,4$ . So perhaps the answer is $1/5$ of choosing $201$ from $1000$ ?","['elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
