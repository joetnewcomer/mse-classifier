2947346,Homeomorphisms of the 2-sphere $S^2$ fixing a set of points.,"I was reading the book by Benson Farb and Dan Margalit titled A Primer on Mapping Class Groups . In chapter 2, Proposition 2.3, it is given that The action given by $$\text{Mod}(S_{0,3}) \longrightarrow \Sigma_3 $$ is an isomorphism. They begin with the fact that the given action is a surjective homomorphism. My question is how? To be precise what I mean to say is that, since we know that the elements of Mod $(S_{0,3})$ fix the set of punctures, we can proceed along that line. But, given any non-trivial permutation how do I know that there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism. Then, the question boils down to the following, Consider a set of n points on the 2-sphere ( $S^2$ ), can every permutation of these n points be extended to an orientation preserving homeomorphism? Thanks in advance.","['mapping-class-group', 'general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

2947450,Constructive Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT),"I'm trying to learn a bit about intuitionistic/constructive mathematics, as I want to understand a little about topos theory and homotopy type theory (HoTT).  I'm confused as to why the intermediate value theorem doesn't hold in constructive analysis. Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function on the interval $(a, b)$ .  Further, suppose $f(a) < 0$ and $f(b) > 0$ .  By classical analysis, there exists a point $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$ .  I'm told that this doesn't generally hold in constructive or intuitionistic logic.  I would like to know why the following ""construction"" does not constitute an outline of a proof. Let $a_n$ be a sequence of points defined as follows: $a_0 = \frac{a + b}{2}$ $a_n = \frac{a + a_{n-1}}{2}$ if $f(a_{n-1}) > 0$ $a_n = \frac{b + a_{n-1}}{2}$ if $f(a_{n-1}) < 0$ $a_n = a_{n-1}$ if $f(a_{n-1}) = 0$ . Define $c = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n$ .  Then $f(c) = 0$ .  This provides an algorithmic construction (using the bisection algorithm) which not only shows that a 0 exists but actually gives a way to compute a zero.  Why is this outline of a proof not valid in constructive logic?  What am I missing?","['constructive-mathematics', 'intuitionistic-logic', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Solution: Given that $x_n \leq y_n \leq z_n \hspace{1mm} \forall n \in \mathbf{N}$ then $y_n$ converges otherwise $x_n$ or $z_n$ diverge. Let lim $(y_n) = y$ . Then, \begin{align} &x_n  \leq y_n \leq z_n     \\ &0 \leq y_n-x_n \leq z_n-x_n \\ \implies &\text{lim}(y_n-x_n) = y-\ell \leq \text{lim}(z_n-x_n) = \ell-

2948356,Combining orderings by agreement,"There is a fixed set $K$ with $k\geq 2$ elements.
A relation $\geq$ on $K$ is called a weak ordering if it is transitive and complete (for each $x,y\in K$ , either $x\geq y$ or $y\geq x$ or both). There is a set $N$ of $n\geq 2$ weak orderings on $K$ , and a number $m \leq n$ . We would like to create a new weak ordering $\succsim$ on $K$ with the following agreement property : $x\succsim y$ only if at least $m$ orderings in $N$ agree that $x \geq y$ . For what values of $m$ (as function of $n,k$ ) is it possible to create this $\succsim$ ? When $m=n$ this might be impossible even for $k=2$ . As an example, suppose $K = \{x,y\}$ , and the set $N$ contains $n=2$ weak orderings: one with $x\geq y$ and one with $y\geq x$ . Then, with $m=2$ , the agreement property implies that neither $x\succsim y$ nor $y\succsim x$ - but then $\succsim$ is not a complete relation. When $m \leq n/2$ , this is possible for $k=2$ . Suppose $K = \{x,y\}$ . Since each ordering in $N$ is complete, it contains either at least $n/2$ relations for which $x\geq y$ , or at least $n/2$ relations for which $y\geq x$ (or both). In the former case set $x\succsim y$ , in the latter case set $y\succsim x$ . The resulting relation is a weak ordering and it satisfies the agreement property. In general, when $m \leq n/k!$ , this is possible, since by the pigeonhole principle, there exists an ordering of the elements that is contained in at least $n/k!$ relations in $N$ , so we can make $\succsim$ equal to this relation. Is it possible for $m > n/k!$ ? What is the largest $m$ (as a function of $n$ and $k$ ) for which this is possible? EDIT: I think it is possible whenever $m \leq n/k$ . Construct the new relation as follows. If $x\geq y$ for more than $n (k-1)/k$ orderings in $N$ , then set $x\succsim y$ . Add to $\succsim$ , all the relations that follow from the existing relations by transitivity. Complete the remaining relations arbitrarily in any way consistent with transitivity. By step 1, in all the remaining pairs, both $x\geq y$ and $y\geq x$ are agreed by at least $n/k$ base relations. The relations added in 1 obviously satifsy the agreement requirement. We have to prove that the same is true for the relations added in 2. Indeed, suppose we have a chain of $l-1$ relations, i.e., $x_1 \succsim x_2 \succsim \cdots \succsim x_l$ , where each of these $\succsim$ relations was added in step 1. So each such relation is agreed by more than $(k-1)n/k$ base relations. So each such relation is disagreed by less than $n/k$ base relations. So, at most $(l-1)n/k$ base relations disagree to at least one $\succsim$ relation. So, a least $(k-l+1)n/k$ base relations agree to all $\succsim$ relations. Since each base relation is transitive, at least $(k-l+1)n/k$ base relations agree that $x_1\geq x_l$ . Since there are at most $k$ elements, $l\leq k$ . Therefore, at least $n/k$ base relations agree that $x_1\geq x_l$ , so the agreement requirement is satisfied. QUESTION: is it possible when $m > n/k$ ?","['order-theory', 'combinatorics']"

2948593,Computing Airy functions through their Taylor series,"I've been trying to find good methods for numerically computing Airy functions, and I found that for small arguments it's convenient to use their Taylor series expansions: $$\text{Ai} (z)=\frac{1}{3^{2/3} \pi} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\Gamma(1/3(n+1))}{n!}(3^{1/3}z)^n \sin[(2(n+1)\pi)/3]$$ $$\text{Bi} (z)=\frac{1}{3^{1/6} \pi} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\Gamma(1/3(n+1))}{n!}(3^{1/3}z)^n |\sin[(2(n+1)\pi)/3]|$$ While these expansions are inconvenient for direct implementation, I've modified them in the following way. Let's define some quantities: $$C_0=\frac{\Gamma(1/3)}{3^{1/3}} \\ D_0=\Gamma(2/3)$$ And recurrence relations: $$C_k=\frac{C_{k-1}}{3k(3k-1)} \\ D_k=\frac{D_{k-1}}{3k(3k-2)}$$ Then the general terms will be: $$A_k=z^{3k} \left(C_k-\frac{z}{3k+1}D_k \right) \\ B_k=z^{3k} \left(C_k+\frac{z}{3k+1}D_k \right)$$ And finally: $$\text{Ai}(z)= \frac{3^{1/6}}{2 \pi}\sum_{k=0}^\infty A_k$$ $$\text{Bi}(z)= \frac{3^{2/3}}{2 \pi}\sum_{k=0}^\infty B_k$$ This seems to work great for (approximately) $|z|<7$ (including complex values) using around $20-25$ terms of the recurrence, for the larger arguments there seem to be some numerical issues. My questions are as follows: Can this algorithm be improved in some obvious way for better convergence/stability, taking into account possible rounding/cancellation errors? And what is the best way to compute these functions for larger arguments? Can I already use the asymptotic expansions listed in some sources for $|z|>7$ ?

AiBi(pi/exp(1)) Update: Wanted to point out an obvious improvement. Instead of computing the coefficients, it's much better to use backwards recurrence. For example, for the first part of the series: $$f(z) =  \sum_{k=0}^\infty C_k z^{3k}$$ Pick some $K_m$ large enough, then define (for the sake of simplicity I changed $C_0=1$ ): $$f_0=1 \\ f_{k'}=1+\frac{z^3}{3(K_m-k')(3(K_m-k')-1)}f_{k'-1}, \qquad k'=0,1,2,\dots,K_m-1$$ This should make the numerical computation faster and more stable (obviously, $z^3$ should be precomputed).","['numerical-methods', 'airy-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

The RCF applies only to odd number, and is defined as: $$R(n)=\frac{3n+1}{2^r}$$ where $r$ denotes the largest exponent of the largest power of two that divides $3n+1$ .
Denote $i$ as the $i$ 'th iteration of the function. Define also $r$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z_0^+}$ . Lets do some examples (the initial numbers are explicitly chosen): \begin{array}\hline

However, in $R^i(n)$ , the digits $9$ and $5$ can't be the first digit or else $R^{i+1}(n)$ will not produce the desired effect. Q: Im sure these patterns have been researched on, any literature about these specifics? When $R^i(n) = 539$ then $n=359$ for $i-1$ . This particular iteration of the function looks like it has an inverse. There might be examples that I am not aware of that work for other numbers but I have not found any. I've seen these numbers in other sequences, namely prime numbers. The following formula gives primes where $n$ is defined by a sequence that can be found here : $$\frac{320\cdot10^n+31}{9}$$ Set $n=7$ This results in the number: $355555559$ . Whatever $n$ we set, the count of $5$ 's between $3$ and $9$ will be same as $n$ . If we put this into the RCF as input? Well we get $R^i(355555559)\to R^{i+1}(533333339)$ . There does not seem to be a relation between the number of digits between $5$ and $9$ and the primes in the collatz function, but the most significant and least significant digit might have?

Convergence in probability requires that $P(Y_n \geq \epsilon) \rightarrow 0 $ My reasoning so far is the following. Given convergence in distribution I can use Porohov's theorem that $P(|Y_n|>M)< \epsilon$ , for some positive $M$ and some positive $\epsilon$ . Now, I need to show that this translates into $P(|Y_n| \geq \epsilon)=0$ and this will be convergence in probability.

2949278,"In Cantor's Diagonalization Argument, why are you allowed to assume you have a bijection from naturals to rationals but not from naturals to reals?","Firstly I'm not saying that I don't believe in Cantor's diagonalization arguments, I know that there is a deficiency in my knowledge so I'm asking this question to patch those gaps in my understanding. From my understanding of Cantor's Diagonalization argument, if you apply diagonalization to a mapping from one set of numbers to another, you will always obtain a number that is not in the mapping. So this works to prove that the reals aren't countable because if you have a mapping from the naturals to the reals then you can use diagonalization to obtain a number that's not in the mapping, and this number is a real obviously, so the mapping isn't a surjection. We're not allowed to assume that the mapping from the naturals to the reals is a bijection to begin with. But when people explain why the diagonalization process doesn't produce a rational from a mapping from naturals to rationals we are allowed to assume that the mapping is a bijection to begin with? In the questions asked here: Why does Cantor's diagonal argument not work for rational numbers? The answers says: To be precise, the procedure does not let you guarantee that the
  number you obtain has a periodic decimal expansion (that is, that it
  is a rational number), and so you are unable to show that the
  ""diagonal number"" is a rational that was not in the original list. In
  fact, if your original list is given explicitly by some bijection,
  then one is able to show just as explicitly that the number you obtain
  is not a rational. Why are we allowed to assume that the original list is a bijection? Is there some way to prove that the mapping from the naturals to the rationals is a bijection that is not susceptible to diagonalization? If we can assume that the mapping from naturals to rationals is an undiagonalizable bijection why can't we do the same for the mapping from naturals to reals?",['elementary-set-theory']
2949295,the line with two origins and the related equivalence relation,"I'm trying to prove that the line with two origin is not Hausdorff but I'm having trouble understanding the problem statement. $\textbf{I'm not asking for a solution}$ , I just need a clarification of what the problem means. Here is the problem: (Problem 3-16 from LeeTM): Let $X$ be the subset $(\mathbb{R} \times \{0\}) \cup (\mathbb{R} \times \{1\}) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ . Define an equivalence relation on $X$ by declaring $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$ if $x \neq 0$ . Show that the quotient space $X/ \sim$ is locally Euclidean and second countable, but not Hausdorff. where LeeTM:=Introduction to Topological Manifolds by John Lee. $\textbf{My question:}$ what does ""declaring $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$ if $x \neq 0$ "" mean? I have two guesses. (Guess 1) Let $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2) \in X$ , we say $(x_1,y_1) \sim (x_2,y_2)$ if and only if $x_1,x_2$ are non-zero with $x_1=x_2$ and $\{y_1,y_2\}=\{0,1\}$ But if this is what he meant, then the equivalence class of $(0,0) \in X$ is the empty set because its $x$ -coordinate is zero : no point in $X$ can have the same non-zero $x$ -coordinate as $(0,0)$ . However, equivalence classes can't be the empty set because of the reflexivity. Therefore, I had a second guess (Guess 2) $(x_1,y_1) \sim (x_2,y_2)$ if and only if $x_1=x_2$ and $\{y_1,y_2\}=\{0,1\}$ . In this case, we have $$(0,0) \notin [(0,0)] = \{(0,1)\} $$ which contradicts the reflexivity of equivalence relation. So my second guess is also wrong. $\textbf{What does he mean really? what is the equivalence relation he's trying to define?}$ In example 3.48 of LeeTM, he used the similar wording: "" let $\sim$ be the equivalence relation on $\bar{\mathbb{B}}^2$ ( the closed unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ) generated by $(x,y) \sim (x,-y)$ for all $(x,y) \in \partial \mathbb{B}^2$ "". He defined the equivalence relation for the points on the boundary but what about those on the interior? (Likewise, in problem 3-16, he defined the equivalence relation for $x \neq 0$ but what about $x=0$ ?) He uses this ""description"" more than one time so I think it may be a terminology that everyone knows (except me). $\textbf{Can someone explain to me what does this wording/description of equivalence relation mean?}$","['equivalence-relations', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

(b) with no child getting greater than or equal to $2$ teddy bears? (c) with each child getting only $3$ goodies? \ My work/attempts: I'm pretty confident with my first two responses... (a) Since the teddy bears are distinct there are $4^3$ ways to distribute them to four children. Meanwhile, since the lollipops are identical, we can consider them as dots and the $4$ children having $3$ slashes to separate them. We then can use the choose function to determine the number of ways to distribute them: ${9+3\choose 3}$ = ${12\choose 3}$ ways. Therefore there are $4^3{12\choose 3}$ outcomes. (b) Since the children can not get greater than or equal to $2$ bears we will assume there is no repetition of the bears. Thus rather than having $4^3$ ways to distribute the distinct bears to the 4 children, there will be $4$ x $3$ x $2$ ways to distribute the bears (or 4!). Again the lollipops are identical so we still have ${12\choose 3}$ to distribute these to the 4 children. Thus our number of outcomes for this case is 4! ${12\choose 3}$ .

However, I dont know if $X$ is cadlag, adapted implies $Z_k(X^{T_{k+1}} - X^{T_k})$ is adapted. That $Z_k$ variable is throwing me off.

Question: How to show that $F(s)\overset{s\to\infty}{\longrightarrow} 0$ ? Remarks: The function $F$ is the Laplace transform of $f$ . Simmons book says that the convergence $F(s)\overset{s\to\infty}{\longrightarrow} 0$ is true in general but proves it only if $f$ is piecewise continuous and of exponential order. A similar reasoning can be applied if $f\in L^p(0,\infty)$ for some $p>1$ : from Hölder's inequality, $$|F(s)|\leq \|e^{-st}\|_{L^q}\|f\|_{L^p}=\frac{1}{(q s)^{1/q}}\|f\|_{L^p}\qquad(\tfrac{1}{p}+\tfrac{1}{q}=1)$$ which implies the desired result. I couldn't figure out how to treat the case where $f$ is not $p$ -integrable as, for example, $f(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$ (for this particular example we can see that the condition is satisfied by calculating the integral, which gives $F(s)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{s}}$ ).","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'laplace-transform', 'real-analysis', 'riemann-integration']"

  that there exists a row or a column of the chessboard which contains
  at least $\sqrt{n}$ distinct numbers. This question is dying for a proof by contradiction, but I can't seem to show how. When I searched through the Internet, there is the following hint: Assume each row and each column has less than $\sqrt{n}$ distinct numbers in
  it. For each row or column, consider the number of distinct numbers in
  it. I feel like double counting is involved in the process, but what to count in two different ways? Also I can prove the statement with the probabilistic method but I would really like to learn the double counting approach. Here is the other proof: Choose a random row or column ( $2n$ choices). Let $\textbf X$ be the number of distinct entries in it. Use the indicator variable $I_i$ , for the existence of number $i$ in the block: $\textbf X = \sum I_i.$ Clearly, $E[I_i] = P[I_i = 1]$ .  Then $P[I_i = 1] \geq 2\sqrt n / (2n) = 1/\sqrt n$ . The lower bound is obtained if all the $i$ happens to be in some $\sqrt n$ edged square sub-matrix.

I will introduce some definitions and results that appear in some exercises of this same book that I think is necessary to prove this exercise. We have the following definition in the exercise $10$ of the chapter $1$ : $\textbf{Definition of The Hodge star operation.}$ Given a $k$ -form $\omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ we will define an $(n-k)$ -form $* \omega$ by setting $$* (dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}) = (-1)^{\sigma} (dx_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j_{n-k}})$$ and extending it linearly, where $i_1 < \cdots < i_k$ , $j_1 < \cdots < j_{n-k}$ , $(i_1, \cdots, i_k, j_1, \cdots, j_{n-k})$ is a permutation of $(1,2,\cdots,n)$ and $\sigma$ is $0$ or $1$ according to the permutation is even or odd, respectively. We have that if $\omega$ is a $k$ -form defined in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then $** \omega = (-1)^{k(n-k)} \omega$ by the item $c$ of the exercise $10$ of the chapter $1$ . The item $b$ of exercise $11$ of chapter $1$ states that if $v: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a differentiable vector field and $\omega$ is the differential $1$ -form obtained from $v$ by the canonical isomorphism induced by the inner product $\langle , \rangle$ and $\nu$ is the volume element of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (Exercise $9$ ), the divergence can be obtained as follow: $$v \mapsto \omega \mapsto * \omega \mapsto d(* \omega) = \text{div} \ v \ \nu$$ $\textbf{Definition of the rotational.}$ Let be $v: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a differentiable vector field. The rotational form $\text{rot} \ v$ is the $(n-2)$ -form defined by $$v \mapsto \omega \mapsto d\omega \mapsto *(d\omega) = \text{rot} \ v,$$ where $v \mapsto \omega$ is the correspondence between $1$ -forms and vector fields induce by the inner product. Keep in mind these definition and the item $b$ of the exercise $11$ of chapter $1$ , I tried prove the exercise $15$ . $\textbf{My attempt:}$ a) I tried another approach to do the item $a$ : By the question $14.a$ in chapter $4$ of this do Carmo's book, I know that Using this and the question $14.b2$ in chapter $4$ of this do Carmo's book (which I attached previously on this post), I know that if $v := A e_1 + B e_2 + C e_3$ and $\text{div} \ v = 0$ , then exist differentiable real functions $P,Q,R$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which satisfy the system given in question $14$ of chapter $4$ , but the left hand side of the equations of the system is precisely the rotational of a differentiable vector field $u: \mathbb{R}^3 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $u(x) := P(x) e_1 + Q(x) e_2 + R(x) e_3$ by the question $14.b2$ . Thus, $\text{rot} \ u = v$ . b) If $\text{rot} \ v = 0$ , then $*(d\omega) = 0$ . By the item $c$ of the exercise $10$ of the chapter $1$ , $$**(d\omega) = (-1)^{2(3-2)} d\omega = d\omega$$ and $**(d\omega) = 0$ by the definition of the Hodge star operation. Thus, $d\omega = 0$ . Since $\mathbb{R}^3$ is contractible to a point for every point of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , it follows from Poincaré's lemma that exists a $0$ -form $f$ such that $\omega = df$ . By the correspondence between vector fields and $1$ -forms, we conclude that $\text{grad} \ f = v$ . I would like to know if my attempts for the items $a$ and $b$ are correct.

I'm not qualified to say the following is proper or rigorous, it was just an experiment. Consider $$I = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2(x^2 + 1)}\, \mathrm dx.$$ Let $$I(t) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^2(tx)}{x^2(x^2 + 1)} \,\mathrm dx$$ Take the Laplace Transform to yield \begin{align*}
\mathscr L[I(t)] &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\mathscr L[\sin^2(tx)]}{x^2(x^2 + 1)}\,\mathrm dx\\ 
&= \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\mathscr 1}{x^2(x^2 + 1)}\frac{2x^2}{s(s^2 + 4x^2)}\,\mathrm dx\\ 
&= \frac{2}{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x^2 + 1)(4x^2 + s^2)}\,\mathrm dx.
\end{align*} Splitting via Partial Fraction Decomposition we arrive at \begin{align*}
\mathscr L[I(t)] &= \frac{2}{s(s^2 - 4)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[ \frac{1}{x^{2} + 1} - \frac{4}{4x^{2} + s^2}\right] \,\mathrm dx\\
&= \frac{2}{s(s^2 - 4)}\left[\arctan(x) - \frac{2}{s}\arctan\left(\frac{2x}{s}\right)\right]_{0}^{\infty}\\
&= \frac{2}{s(s^2 - 4)}\left[\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{2}{s}\frac{\pi}{2} \right]\\
&= \frac{\pi}{s^2(s + 2)}
\end{align*} And so $$I(t) = \mathscr L^{-1}\left[\frac{\pi}{s^2(s + 2)}\right] = \pi\left[\frac{t}{2} + \frac{e^{-2t}}{4} - \frac{1}{4}\right]$$ Hence, $$I(1) = \pi\left[\frac{1}{2} + \frac{e^{-2}}{4} - \frac{1}{4}
\right] = \frac{\pi}{4}\left[1 + e^{-2}\right]$$ which is correct. I'm unsure if this is mere luck or whether this is a viable method. Has anyone used this method before?","['integration', 'proof-verification', 'laplace-transform', 'inverse-laplace']"
2950856,When does $\mathrm{End}(X)\cong X$?,"I noticed in lecture that for any field $\mathbb F$ , take the one-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\mathbb F$ and write $\mathbb F\cong V\cong V^\ast=\mathrm{Hom}(V,\mathbb F)\cong\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb F,\mathbb F)=\mathrm{End}(\mathbb F)$ . This is a very basic case, so I'm just wondering, more generally, for what kinds of spaces $X$ is $\mathrm{End}(X)\cong X$ ?","['abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
2950889,Probability that exactly 2 balls are white,"What I did. I let $X$ be number of withdraws before $x$ white balls. We can call our succes in this case to be gettin a white ball and probability is of course $p = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ . So we see $X$ is negative binomial r.v with $n=4$ trials. So, $$ P(X=2) = { 4 - 1 \choose 2 - 1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 $$ Which gives $$ P(X=2) = \boxed{\dfrac{3}{16} }$$ Am I interpreting the problem correctly?",['probability']
2950908,Can the torus and the Klein bottle be thought as $\mathbb{R}^2/G$ with $G$ a finite group acting freely,"I have recently proved the following exercise, Let $G$ be a finite group acting freely on a (compact) topological manifold of dimension $n$ . Then, $X/G$ is a (compact) manifold of dimension $n$ . I have done this in the context of an introductory course on topology: thus, we have not talked about anything much more profound than the definition of manifold itself. More so, the aforementioned exercise was guided. In the same spirit, there is an excersice which asks to prove that the torus and the Klein bottle are $2$ -dimensional manifolds. I presume this can be proved 'manually' i.e. by looking at an explicit construction of the quotient of $[0,1]^2$ . However, I want to know whether there is a proof involving an free action from a finite group acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Any hints would be much appreciated.","['manifolds', 'general-topology']"
2950955,"Is an SDE really equal to an integral equation, or is it rather ""its integral"" that is?","Ive been told and been reading in some textbooks on SDE's that an SDE really is an integral equation. In other words, that $ dX= \beta dt + \sigma dW$ $\,$ ""really  means"" $\,$ $X_{t}= X_{0} +\int_{0}^{t} \beta dt +\int_{0}^{t} \sigma dW$ However I am getting the impression that this is not the case and that $dX$ really is a measure type object which we in turn can ""take the integral off"", giving us the latter above. This in turn implies that the SDE really has a meaning maybe not as a differental equation in the usual sense but as something else. This impression was obtained for instance from comments in the following post, If $dX_{t} = X_{t}\,dt + \,dB_{t}$, why does $e^{- t}dX_{t} = e^{-t} X_{t} \,dt + e^{-t} \,dB_{t}$? In particular the discussion involving $dX=dY$ , $AdX=AdY$ and then taking the integral of that. With that background I ask the following; Is an SDE then really equal to an integral equation? This would be the same as saying or declaring rather that $\mu= d\mu$ , which is fine if one sticks to that convention, but that dosnt seam to be the case in some calculations with differentials. I also wonder if it is possible to make sense of the $dX$ if one uses more advanced tools? Similar to the case of $dx$ in a ODE, that indeed justify some ""informal"" operations. 
My impression is that in general the $dx$ can be tought of as a measure, a differential form etc.. Found these; Are SDE's really ""differential""? Problem with understading ""mixed"" integration , Why do people write stochastic differential equations in differential form? that looks like similar questions, but which are not answering my question.","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'soft-question', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus']"
2950962,Define an injection from $2^{\Bbb N}$ to $\Bbb R$,"Define an injection from $2^{\Bbb N}$ to $\Bbb R$ Does this proof look fine or contain logical gaps and flaws? Thank you for your help! We define a mapping $F:2^{\Bbb N} \to \Bbb R$ by $$\forall f\in2^{\Bbb N}: F(f)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f(n)}{3^{n+1}}$$ It's clear that for all $f\in 2^{\Bbb N}$ : $$F(f)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{n=k}\dfrac{f(n)}{3^{n+1}}$$ and $$F(f)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f(n)}{3^{n+1}}\le \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{3^{n+1}} = \dfrac{1}{2}$$ Thus $F(f)$ is the limit of a strictly increasing and bounded above sequence of rational numbers. Hence $F(f)$ exists for all $f\in 2^{\Bbb N}$ . For $f_1,f_2\in 2^{\Bbb N}$ and $f_1\neq f_2$ , let $N=\min\{n\in\Bbb N\mid f_1(n)\neq f_2(n)\}$ . $|F(f_1)-F(f_2)|=\left |\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)}{3^{n+1}}-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right |=\left |\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right |= \left |\sum_{n=N}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right |= \left |\dfrac{f_1(N)-f_2(N)}{3^{n+1}}+\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right | \ge \left |\dfrac{f_1(N)-f_2(N)}{3^{N+1}}\right |- \left |\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right |=\dfrac{1}{3^{N+1}}- \left |\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right |\ge \dfrac{1}{3^{N+1}}- \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\left |\dfrac{f_1(n)-f_2(n)}{3^{n+1}} \right | \ge \dfrac{1}{3^{N+1}}- \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{3^{n+1}} =\dfrac{1}{3^{N+1}}- \dfrac{1}{2.3^{N+1}}=\dfrac{1}{2.3^{N+1}}>0.$ Hence $f_1\neq f_2\implies F(f_1)\neq F(f_2)$ . Thus $F$ is injective.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'proof-verification']"

It is actually a one dimensional case of following inequality $$\int_{D}|\nabla f|^2\geq \int_{\partial D}f^2$$ where $D$ is the 2-dimensional unit disc and $f$ is a function in sobolev space $H^1(D)$ with mean value zero, i.e., $\int_{D}f=0$ .

2951028,Show group of order $4563=3^3\cdot13^2$ is not simple.,"Show a group of order $4563=3^3\cdot13^2$ is not simple. I am confused when dealing with these Sylow's game. Especially when the order becomes large. It seems there is no common rules to solve this kind problems. My try : $n_{13}=1+13t$ and $n_{13}$ divides $3^3=27$ , hence $t=0,2$ . If $t=0$ then we are done. If $t=2$ , There are $27$ 13-subgroups of order 169. Then consider the conjugation action of G on the set of 13-subgroups. Prove it induced a homomorphism between $G$ and $S_{27}$ . And want to claim a contradiction by $|G|$ does not divide $27!$ . But sadly it does divide.

2951050,Prime divisor in positive integers sequences,"I would like to know if anyone has an ideea if the following statement is true.
For any sequence of consecutive positive integerers $(n_0, n_0+1,..., n_0+k).$ Where $n_0 \ge 1, k\ge 0,$ but $k\ge 1$ if $n_0 = 0$ (so different from the sequence (1)). There exists a prime number p that divides only one number in the sequence. For example in the sequence (14, 15, 16) 7 divides only one of them, it doesn't have to be unique as 5 also divides only one of them. A few restrictions that I managed to find for a counter-example to exist: The sequence cannot contain a prime number, otherwise it will also contain a largest prime number and that prime will only divide itself. k has to be smaller than $2\times n_0,$ otherwise the sequence will contain a prime number. The number of elements in the sequence (i.e. $k+1$ ) cannot be a prime number, otherwise that prime will only divide one number. I made a simple computer program to check for such a sequence and couldn't find any in all possible sequences for up to $n_0 = 200000.$","['number-theory', 'prime-factorization', 'prime-numbers']"
