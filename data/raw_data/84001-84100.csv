1099579,"Why are automorphisms of $D_{2n}, n \geq 5$ odd, not always inner?","The dihedral group of order $2n$ is often presented as $$D_{2n}= \langle r,s: r^n=s^2=1, rs= sr^{-1} \rangle \text{,}$$ where $r$ denote rotations and $s$ denote reflections of a regular $n$-gon. Furthermore, I've read that for $D_6 \cong S_3$, i.e. the symmetric group of permutations on $3$ letters, every automorphism is inner. I would like to know why this is so for this particular case, and why then is not every automorphism inner for $D_{2n}, n \geq 5$, where $n$ is odd? For the first case, $Z(D_6)=1$, i.e. the center of $D_6$ is trivial, so that the group of inner automorphisms $\text{Inn}(D_6) \cong D_6$, but how can I justify that such automorphisms are actually inner?","['dihedral-groups', 'group-theory']"

1099614,How to integrate $\int_0^\infty\frac{dx}{1+x^n}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Improper integration involving complex analytic arguments: $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^a}dx$, where $a>1$ and $a \in \mathbb{R}$ (3 answers) A few improper integral (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . I was playing around with the function $\dfrac{1}{1+x^2}$, and knowing that the integral over $(0,\infty)$ was $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, I was hoping to see if there was some neat pattern to determining the value of the following generalized form:
$$I=\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{1+x^n}$$
for natural $n\ge2$. I ran some computations in Mathematica and got a consistent result of $\dfrac{\pi}{n}\csc\left(\dfrac{\pi}{n}\right)$, which also happens to be equivalent to $\dfrac{1}{n}\Gamma\left(\dfrac{1}{n}\right)\Gamma\left(1-\dfrac{1}{n}\right)=\mathrm{B}\left(\dfrac{1}{n},1-\dfrac{1}{n}\right)$. Is there some neat trick I can use to get this result? I've considered integrating along a contour, but I'm somewhat rusty with complex methods. Also, the result was posted previously here . I tried something like this instead:
$$\frac{1}{1+x^n}=\begin{cases}\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^kx^{nk}&\text{for }|x|<1\\\\
\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k x^{-n(k+1)}&\text{for }|x|>1\end{cases}$$
then integrating along the respective intervals $(0,1)$ and $(1,\infty)$. Here's my attempt:
$$\begin{align*}I
&=\left\{\int_0^1+\int_1^\infty\right\}\frac{dx}{1+x^n}\\\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left\{\int_0^1 (-1)^kx^{nk}\,dx+\int_1^\infty (-1)^kx^{-n(k+1)}\,dx\right\}\\\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left\{(-1)^k\left[\frac{x^{nk+1}}{nk+1}\right]_{0}^{1}+(-1)^k\left[\frac{x^{-n(k+1)+1}}{-n(k+1)+1}\right]_1^\infty\right\}\\\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left\{\frac{(-1)^k}{nk+1}-\frac{(-1)^{k}}{1-n(k+1)}\right\}\\\\
&=\left(1-\frac{1}{1-n}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{1-2n}\right)\\

1099619,Covariant derivative geometric interpretation,"I'm having some trouble understanding what the covariant derivative means geometrically.

Also, for a first-order tensor $V^i$ such that vector $ \textbf{R} = V^i \textbf{Z}_i$, I know that I can say $$ \frac{\partial \textbf{R}}{\partial Z^k} = \nabla_k (V^i) \textbf{Z}_i $$ However, how can I understand the covariant derivative of higher order tensors and of vectors?

Using a symbolic computation software (Mathematica), I got the following interesting results:
$$

$$ The numbers appearing at the first $\coth$ term are easy to guess: they are the famous Fibonacci numbers . The numbers at the second $\coth$ term can also be guessed: they appear to be the Lucas numbers . Those are constructed like the Fibonacci numbers but starting with $2,1$ instead of $0,1$. Hence: Conjecture: $$\text{S}_{2k}=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(\sqrt{\frac{F_k}{F_{k-1}}}\coth\left(\sqrt{\frac{F_k}{F_{k-1}}}\pi\right)+\sqrt{\frac{L_k}{L_{k-1}}}\coth\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_k}{L_{k-1}}}\pi\right)\right)-\frac{1}{2}$$ I have verified this conjecture for many $k$'s and it always work out perfectly. To me this is quite amazing, but I am not able to verify the conjecture. Can anyone prove it? Moreover, if true the conjecture implies that $$\lim_{k\to\infty}\text{S}_{2k}=\frac{\sqrt{\varphi}\pi\coth\left(\sqrt{\varphi}\pi\right)-1}{2}$$ which is also very nice ($\pi$ and $\varphi$ don't meet very often).","['continued-fractions', 'experimental-mathematics', 'lucas-numbers', 'fibonacci-numbers', 'limits']"
1099655,Law of large numbers for Brownian Motion (Direct proof using L2-convergence),"In “Brownian Motion” by Schilling and Partzsc, they give a HINT to prove the Law of Large Numbers for Brownian Motion (not in their solutions, fyi) by (1) Noting that $\left|\frac{B_{t}}{t}\right|\leq\left|\frac{B_{t}-B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\right|+\frac{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\left|\frac{B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\right|\leq\max_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor \leq s\leq\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\left|\frac{B_{s}-B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\right|+\frac{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\left|\frac{B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\right|$ and (2) showing that the first term on RHS converges to 0
  in $L^{2}$
  using the Reflection Principle and then making a subsequence argument. I've made the following observations, but other than that, I'm stuck. First, the usual (strong) law of large numbers gives us $\frac{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\left|\frac{B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\right|\rightarrow0\;\mbox{a.s.}\; t\rightarrow\infty.$
 Hence it suffices to show that $\max_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor \leq s\leq\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\left|\frac{B_{s}-B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\right|$
  converges a.s. to 0
  (or maybe something weaker is enough??). If we can show $L^{2}$
  convergence to 0
 , then we have a.s. convergence for a subsequence. I've been able to show the $L^{2}$
  convergence (see below), but I cannot get my head around the subsequence argument. Diverging from the Hint, I've proved the a.s. convergence directly by Borel-Cantelli and Doob's Inequality. But I'd really like to understand the $L^{2}$
  approach as well. $L^{2}$ convergence to 0: By $\left(B_{s+n}\right)_{s\geq0}\overset{D}{=}\left(B_{s}+B_{n}\right)_{s\geq0}$
  and Doob's Inequality we get $\mathbb{E}\left(\left(\max_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor \leq s\leq\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\left|\frac{B_{s}-B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor }\right|\right)^{2}\right)	=	\frac{1}{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor ^{2}}\mathbb{E}\left(\left(\max_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor \leq s\leq\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\left|B_{s}-B_{\left\lfloor t\right\rfloor +1}\right|\right)^{2}\right)

  By definition, there is a limit (of the sequence). $\textbf{Theorem.}$
  There are no two limits. $\textit{Proof.}$
  We prove by contradiction.
  To that end,
  we assume that there are two limits.
  Now, our mission is to deduce a contradiction.
  Let $x,x'$ be limits such that $x \ne x'$.
  By definition ($\textit{limit}$), we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
     &\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}, \varepsilon > 0 :
      \exists N           \in \mathbb{N}                  :
      \forall n           \in \mathbb{N}, n > N           :
      |x_n - x| < \varepsilon && \text{ and} \\
     &\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}, \varepsilon > 0 :
      \exists N           \in \mathbb{N}                  :
      \forall n           \in \mathbb{N}, n > N           :
      |x_n - x'| < \varepsilon.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*} Since $x \ne x'$, we have $0 < \frac{1}{2} |x - x'|$.
  We choose $\varepsilon := \frac{1}{2} |x - x'|$. By assumption, there are $N,N' \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
     &\forall n           \in \mathbb{N}, n > N           :
      |x_n - x| < \varepsilon && \text{ and} \\
     &\forall n           \in \mathbb{N}, n > N'          :
      |x_n - x'| < \varepsilon.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  We choose $n := \max\{N, N'\} + 1$.
  Obviously, both $n > N$ and $n > N'$.
  Therefore, we have both $|x_n - x| < \varepsilon$ and $|x_n - x'| < \varepsilon$.
  Thus, by adding inequalities,
  \begin{equation*}
    |x_n - x| + |x_n - x'| < 2 \varepsilon .
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover,
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      2 \varepsilon & =   |x - x'|
                      && | \text{ by choice of } \varepsilon \\
                    & =   |x + 0 - x'| \\
                    & =   |x + ( - x_n + x_n) - x'| \\
                    & =   |(x - x_n) + (x_n - x')| & \qquad & \\
                    & \le |x - x_n| + |x_n - x'|
                      && | \text{ by subadditivity of abs. val.} \\
                    & =   |x_n - x| + |x_n - x'|
                      && | \text{ by evenness of abs. val.} \\
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Hence, by transitivity, we have $2 \varepsilon < 2 \varepsilon$.
  Obviously, we deduced a contradiction. QED","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

I'm trying to informally explain why $\pi$ holds for all circles. I would like to know if there is anything pertinent that I can add, or that is wrong with this explanation. It's an explanation, not an attempt at a rigorous proof, so go easy. $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$ is the ratio of $C$ , the circumference of the circle, to $d$ , the diameter of the circle. The ratio holds for all circles because all circles are ""similar"". That is to say they are all the same essential shape and that they only differ in size, thus for ""similarity"" to hold this ratio must extend to all circles. It is easier to see why $\pi$ holds for all circles if we rewrite it in terms of the radius $r$ as $\pi=\frac{2\pi r }{2r}$ . According to this, any change in the radius $r$ (and thus circumference and ultimately the size of the circle) will affect an equivalent change in the numerator and denominator of the equation. So in essence any changes in the size of the radius $r$ and subsequently the circle are negated, so the ratio $\pi=\frac{C}{d}$ holds for all circle.","['pi', 'trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'soft-question']"
1100428,Are injections harder to find than surjections?,"Given two finite sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A|<|B|$ There are more functions from $B$ to $A$ than from $A$ to $B$ except when $|A|=1$ or $|A|=2,|B|=3,4$. See here for proof . It is also true there are more surjections from $B$ to $A$ than injections from $A$ to $B$. One way to prove this is as follows: Create a bipartite graph in which he vertices in one part are the injections from $A$ to $B$ and the vertices in the other part are the surjections from $B$ to $A$. Connect two vertices if and only if they are inverses (on the appropriate sides) of each other. injective functions have $(|A|)^{|B|-|A|}$ left inverses. On the other hand the number of right inverses a surjective function can have depends on the function itself. It is the product of the order of the pullbacks of all the singletons in the image. So then it is the product of $A$ numbers which add $B$ and hence by AM-GM it is bounded by $(\frac{|B|}{|A|})^{|A|}$ Therefore we have $I(|A|)^{|B|-|A|}\leq S(\frac{|B|}{|A|})^{|A|}$ where $I$ is the number of injective functions and $S$ of surjective functions. This is because the sum of the degrees of each of the two parts of a bipartite graph is equal. Therefore $\frac{S}{I}\leq\frac{|A|^{|B-|A|} |A|^{|A|}}{|B|^{|A|}}=\frac{|A|^{|B|}}{|B|^{|A|}}$. On the other the functions from $B$ to $A$ and from $A$ to $B$ are in ratio $\frac{|A|^{|B|}}{|B|^{|A|}}$. Therefore the number of injective functions are a smaller percentage of the functions from $A$ to $B$ than the surjective functions are from $B$ to $A$. This leads me to believe being surjective is ""easier"" than being injective. Follow up questions:Let $|A|<|B|$ for arbitrary sets $A$ and $B$. Is there a way to prove there are more injective functions from $A$ to $B$ than surjective functions from $B$ to $A$? Is there a way to prove $|A^B|\geq |B^A|$? Is there a way to express the fact that surjections are ""easier"" to find in infinite sets? Would this be true?

1100525,"Rigorously, what is the goal of (machine/statistical) Learning and why is that the goal?","After some time doing machine learning and statistical learning theory, I decided to return to my foundations and make sure that the goal of what I am doing makes sense. First let me define $I(f)$ as the generalization error $I(f) = \int_{x,y} V(f(x),y) d\rho(x,y)$ and $V(f(x),y)$ as the cost function. Also, let $f_S$ be the output of a learning algorithm $A$ given some data, i.e. $f_S = A(S)$. One way to characterize the goal of learning is as follows: $$\inf_{f \in F} I(f)$$ given only a finite training set $S$ sampled from the distribution that generated the data $\rho(x,y)$. Where $F$ is the space of functions where the integral is well defined (things are measurable and good etc etc, not necessarily Hilbert spaces). Technically, if the inf could be achieved, then that would be the best of the best. The optimum of the optimum. Possibly not feasible to compute but mathematically it makes sense. Another way of saying this is, minimizing the expected error given only the training data is the goal of learning. Since we probably can't achieve the above infimum (minimization), we need a way to quantify the quality of our solution $f_S$. One possibility could be: $$\inf_{f_s \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f) \right\} $$ i.e. trying to have a $f_S$ as close to the best as possible. However, I was considering a different way of characterizing what exactly it means to learn and I was wondering if it made sense or if they were equivalent or maybe one is stronger than the other. Consider minimizing the infinity norm between the algorithms output function $f_S = A(S)$ (where $A$ is the learning algorithm and $S$ is the training set) and the best function $f^* = \operatorname{arginf}\limits_{f \in F} I(f)$, i.e. consider: $$ \inf_{f \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ \sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} |f_S(x) - f^*(x)| \right\}$$ would trying to minimize $\sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} |f_S(x) - f^*(x)|$ make sense as a goal for learning? I was told that, that goal was ""too strong"". What does it mean to strong? Is it in a mathematical sense? Like, minimizing the above implies minimizing $I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f)$? Intuitively it seems to me that indeed the above implies minimizing $I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f)$. Why? Because $\inf_{f \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ \sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} |f_S(x) - f^*(x)| \right\}$ means to minimize the difference between $f_S$ (output of learning algorithm) and the optimum $f^*$. This means that if the largest difference is minimized for all $x$, then $f_S$ and $f^*$ are basically the same (or approximately the same). Hence, they should have the same average cost over the whole data space. i.e. $$I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f) \approx 0$$ Maybe is way to strong and we only need them to be similar for data samples $(x,y)$ that are actually possible to sample, so maybe: $$ \inf_{f \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ \sup_{x \in \operatorname{support}(\rho)} |f_S(x) - f^*(x)| \right\}$$ Would this make more sense? Or are both definitions still unreasonable quantities to try to optimize in learning? Why would minimizing: $$ I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f)$$ be a much better goal? Also, after thinking about it more, maybe we would like to take into account the relative weights or relative frequencies of what points are sampled and instead redefine the quantity I suggested and minimize it: $$ \int_{x} |f_S(x) - f^*(x) | d\rho(x)$$ maybe choosing an $f_S$ that achieves the above minimum is a good choice. However, I've never even seen this discussed anywhere. Is the above a bad quantity to consider? What is the difference with minimizing $I(f_S) - \inf_{f \in F} I(f)$ and $ \int_{x,y} |f_S(x) - f^*(x) | d\rho(x,y)$? What are the pros and cons of one and the other?

Or is it a consequence of some other axiom of arithmetic? Thanks! Edit: I understand the intuitive meaning of equality. Answers that stated that $a = b$ means they are the same number or object make sense but what I'm asking is if there is an explicit law of replacement that allows us to make this intuitive truth a valid mathematical deduction. For example is there an axiom of Peano's Axioms or some other axiomatic system that allows for adding or multiplying both sides of an equation by the same number? In all the texts I've come across I've never seen an axiom that states if $a = b$ then $a + c = b + c$ . I have however seen if $a < b$ then $a + c < b + c$ . In my view $<$ and $=$ are similar so the absence of a definition for equality is strange.","['logic', 'arithmetic', 'algebra-precalculus']"

1100585,Is the number of finite strings infinite?,"I already asked this question on Stack Overflow and people kept voting me down and telling me it's ""more of a maths question"" so I will ask the question again: Assuming a finite alphabet, (eg: A,B), can we construct an infinite set of finite strings? Obviously we'll start with the empty string, then A, then B, then AB, AA BA, BB... etc I made the claim (with much disagreement and voting-down) that it's impossible to have an infinite set of finite strings, because if we take out alphabet as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and make our strings have a 1-to-1 correspondence with the natural numbers starting with 0, (so each string is a natural number), then there must be a maximum-length of a string in this set (a finite number, we'll call it N). If this is so, we may take the highest number in the set of length N (which will also be the highest natural number) and count down to 0, removing each number from the set, until we have the empty set. On the other hand if N=Infinity then the set contains infinite strings. I've been met with much disdain for saying this, intuitively I find impossible to believe that there's such thing as an infinite set of finite strings.","['infinity', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Show that if $X$ is normal, then so is $Y$. $\textbf{Attempted solution:}$
Let $A$ and $B$ be any two closed sets of $Y$. Since $p$ is continuous, $C=p^{-1}(A)$ and $D=p^{-1}(B)$ are closed in $X$. Since $X$ is normal, there exist open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $C\subset U_1$ and $D\subset U_2$ and $U_1\cap U_2=\{\phi\}$.
Let $C_1=X-U_1$ and $C_2=X-U_2$. Then $C_1$ and $C_2$ are closed and since $p$ is a closed map, so are $p(C_1)$ and $p(C_2)$. Also $A\cap p(C_1)=\{\phi\}$ and $B\cap p(C_2)=\{\phi\}$ because if it wasn't so then $C_{1}\cap C$ and $C_{2}\cap B$ would be non-empty. Finally, let $V_1=Y-p(C_1)$ and $V_2=Y-p(C_2)$.

1100749,Find the equation of a line that bisects a set of points,"Sorry if this has been asked/answered but I couldn't find anything here or on Google, and for sorry for the poor wording of the title. Anyway, here's my question: Given a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, find the equation of a line such that half of the points on the plane lie on one side of the line, and half lie on the other side. If there are an odd number of points the line must go through one of the points, as well as split the remaining points in half. The odd number of points case is the only one in which our line may pass through a point. For example, if we have a single point, the line simply goes through that point. If we have $2$ points, say on $(0,0)$ and $(0,2)$, the line might be defined by $y=1$ (though something like $y=2x+1$ would also work. For the purposes of this problem the line $x=0$ would not work). If we have $4$ points, $(0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)$, and $(1,0)$, then the equation $y=x$ works. A fairly naive solution would be to always return a line with the equation $y = c$, where $c$ is the median $y$ value of all of our points. This approach works on sets of points such that the median y value is unique, but not otherwise (as our line will now pass through more than a single point.).

For $AP$, I used the Pythagorean Theorem on AB and BP. Since BP = BC - CP, $BP = \frac{3AB}{4}$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem with AB, I got: $AP^2 = (\frac{3AB}{4})^2 + (AB)^2$, which gives us $AP = \frac{5AB}{4}$.

Also, I don't understand how the calculation of $\vec{\nabla}f(x,y)$ could help me in finding the explicit form of the path. Please help, thank you.","['multivariable-calculus', 'functions']"

When $\mathbb{F}=\bar{\mathbb{F}}$, we know that $A,B$ are similar if and only if they have the same Jordan form. What about the the case where $\mathbb{F}\neq \bar{\mathbb{F}}$?
In this case I saw that there is a theorem saying that for two matrices $A,B\in M_n(\mathbb{F})$, if they are similar over $\bar{\mathbb{F}}$ then they are similar over $\mathbb{F}$. However, I can't find any ""natural"" proof for that.

1101360,Question on proof of Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem (from Hatcher Theorem 2C.3),"In Hatcher's statement of the Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem ( 2C.3 ), he has a hypothesis that the space $X$ in question must be a retract of a finite simplicial complex. The first part of the proof qualifies this, and ultimately states: Suppose $r:K \rightarrow X$ is a retraction of the finite simplicial complex K onto
  X. For a map $f:X \rightarrow X$, the composition $fr:K \rightarrow X \subset K$ then has exactly the same fixed points as $f$. Since $r_*:H_n(K) \rightarrow H_n(X)$ is projection onto a direct summand, we clearly have $\text{tr}(f_* r_*) = \text{tr} (f_*)$, so the Lefschetz numbers are equal, i.e. $\tau(f_*r_*) = \tau(f_*)$. Quesions: How is $r_*$ a projection onto a direct summand? How does it ""clearly"" follow from this that the trace of the composition is the same as the trace of $f_*$ itself? Approach: I think I see that $r_*$ is a projection onto a direct summand by looking at the exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow H_n(X) \xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(K) \rightarrow H_n(K, X) \rightarrow 0.$$ Then since $r_* \circ i_*$ is the identity on $H_n(X)$, the exact sequence splits, and so the splitting lemma yields $H_n(K) = H_n(X) \oplus H_n(K, X)$, and the function $r_*$ acts like projection onto the summand $H_n(X)$. From here, I have no ideas on how to see that $\text{tr}(f_* r_*) = \text{tr} (f_*)$. What does this follow from? It is not clear to me.","['homology-cohomology', 'linear-algebra', 'algebraic-topology', 'exact-sequence']"
