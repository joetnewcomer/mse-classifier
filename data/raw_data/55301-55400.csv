596780,"Show these approximations of $\cos$, $\sin$ and $\tan$ are exact.","A while back I was looking for an approximation to $\cos(x)$ and I constructed a polynomial with zeros in the same places as the first few zeros of $cos(x)$: $$c_n(x) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n (x-(n-\frac12)\pi) (x-(\frac12-n)\pi)}{\text{normalising constant}}$$ The normalising constant is chosen so that $c_n(0) = 1$. I wrote a program to determine whether this approximation was any good, and was astonished to discover that in the limit of large $n$ it is exact! At least to the numerical accuracy I was using. I found the same thing for a similar approximation to $\sin(x)$: $$s_n(x) = \frac{x \prod_{i=1}^n (x-n\pi)(x+n\pi)}{\text{normalising constant}}$$ This time the normalising constant is chosen so that $s_n'(0) = 1$. I also tried making an approximation to $\tan(x)$, by making a function that has poles in the same places as the first few poles of $\tan(x)$: $$t_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{x-(n-\frac12)\pi} + \frac{1}{x-(\frac12-n)\pi}\right)$$ Again I was surprised to discover that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}t_n(x) = \tan(x)$ to numerical accuracy. I think it is also possible to make similar series for $\sec(x)$ etc. It was several years before I finally learnt how to prove these identities. It required advanced calculus techniques such as residues, and honestly I don't think I could reproduce the proofs now. Moreover, the proofs were unsatisfactory, since each proof coped with a single case. I feel in my gut that something deeper is going on here. Why does every single dumb attempt work? Is it possible to prove a statement along the lines of ""If two analytic functions have the same poles and zeros then they are equal""? (Obviously some details will need to be firmed up before this statement is true!) Alternatively, is it possible to prove the identities by showing that the approximations satisfy the following defining characteristics of $\cos$, $\sin$ and $\tan$ (or some similar set): $$\frac{d \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}c_n(x)}{dx} = -\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}s_n(x)$$ $$\frac{d \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}s_n(x)}{dx} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}c_n(x)$$ $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}t_n(x) = \frac{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}s_n(x)}{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}c_n(x)}$$ I would be grateful for any insight you can provide.","['residue-calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'roots', 'trigonometry', 'soft-question']"

596825,How to prove that a vector bundle is trivial iff there are n global sections that form a basis on each fiber?,"I can prove the only if part.
My attempt to prove if part is the following: Given $n$ global sections $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ of a vector bundle $E$ on a smooth manifold $M$ such that they form a basis at each fibre, we construct a smooth map $M\times \mathbb R^n \to E$ defined as $$(m, (x_1, ..., x_n))\mapsto x_1s_1+...+x_ns_n$$
It is easy to see this map is injective, smooth and is linear isomorphism on fibers. However, I fail to prove the inverse is smooth because of two elementary reasons: If $s$ is an arbitrary smooth local section of $M$ to $E$, then s has a unique decomposition $s=x_1s_1(m)+...+x_ns_n(m)$ where $x_i$ are local functions. How do we show that they are smooth? If the statement above is shown, we can show every smooth section from $M$ to $E$ maps to a section from $M$ to $M\times \mathbb R^n$. Can this necessarily imply the map from $M\times \mathbb R^n$ to $E$ is smooth? Of course, my direction may be wrong, so if the standard approach is more straightforward, please let me know.","['manifolds', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

In symbols, $$
\sum_{\substack{1 \leq a \leq k/\sqrt{j} \\ a \text{ odd}}} \sum_{\substack{a \leq b \leq aj \\ b \text{ odd}}} \frac{1}{ab}.
$$ For $j=1$, the result of the summation simply corresponds to the infinite harmonic sum of odd squares $1/1 + 1/9 + 1/25\ldots $, which yields $\pi^2/8$. For $j>1$, I obtained the formula $\tfrac{1}{4} \ln(k) \ln(j) + O(1)$. I am particularly interested in this $O(1)$ term. Plotting this term vs $j$ we obtain a discontinuous function, where the most evident discontinuities occur when $j$ is an odd integer.  For instance, setting $j=2$, the constant term is about $0.94$. It progressively decreases (with other discontinuities) to approximately $0.73$ as $j$ increases approaching $3$, but for $j=3$ it raises to about $1.14$. The abrupt increase observed for $j=3$ is equal to $\pi^2/24$ (and more generally, for any odd integer $j$, the term shows a discontinuity with an abrupt increase by $\pi^2/8/j$). Is there any way to express the values of this $O(1)$ term explicitly? Thank you.","['asymptotics', 'sequences-and-series', 'number-theory']"

$$\alpha(t):\mathbb R\to \mathbb R^3,\ \alpha(t)=(a\cos t,a\sin t,bt)$$ If we take the definition of derivative in higher dimensions in Spivak's book we have: A function $f:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^m$ is differentiable at $a\in \mathbb R^m$ if there is a linear transformation $\lambda: \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^m$ such that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{|f(a+h)-f(a)-\lambda(h)|}{|h|}=0$$ I can't see why the $\alpha'(t)$ is the tangent at the point $t$ and I tried also see the derivative as the Jacobian without success.

So for instance $I/I^2$ is a principal module generated by $\overline f=f+I^2$, so $$d:\overline f\mapsto 2y\,dy-3x^2\,dx.$$
This is useful to determine $\alpha$. The source is generated by two vector fields $\partial/\partial x$ and $\partial/\partial y$, so:

Then $X=$ the number of cards drawn before the 5th spade.  Let $Y=X+1$.  Then $Y=$ the number of cards drawn before and including the 5th spade. $P\left\{X_i=1\right\}=$ the probability that card $i$ is drawn before the 5th spade $=\frac{9!}{10!}=\frac{1}{10}$ (because there are $9!$ ways of ordering the $i$th card at the front of 9 spades and $10$ ways of ordering 10 cards).

597355,Iterated Limits Schizophrenia,"Consider the functions $g_n(x)$, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $n \ge 1$ and
$x\in\mathbb{R}$, defined as follows:
$$
   g_n(x) = \begin{cases}
            2n^2x & \text{if }0 \le x < 1/(2n) \\
            2n - 2 n^2 x & \text{if } 1/(2n) \le x < 1/n \\
            0 & \text{everywhere else} \end{cases}
$$ Standard mathematics argument : These functions are triangular, and they all disappear outside of
$[0,1]$, so I can compute $\int_0^1 g_n(x) \, dx = 1$ for every $n$.
For every $x$, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} g_n(x) = 0$. So the limit and the integration can't be interchanged. Here is an animated picture of the functions: The function $g_n(x)$ becomes a sharp peak at $x=0$ for $n \rightarrow \infty$
and, geometrically, it certainly does not disappear or becomes zero. Instead, it seems
that we get, in the end, what physicists know as a delta function. Informally:
$$
   \delta(x) = \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{for } x \ne 0 \\
            \infty & \text{for } x = 0
               \end{cases} \qquad ; \qquad
   \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \delta(x) \, dx = 1
$$
Whatever definition might be the ""rigorous"" one, a delta function ,
roughly speaking, is just a very large peak near $x = 0$ with area normed to $1$.
Furthermore, it is typical that the following function, triangular as well, is indeed supposed to converge to the delta function - instead of becoming zero -
for $n \rightarrow \infty$ and nobody has any doubt about it.
$$
   D_n(x) = \begin{cases}
            n^2x + n & \text{if } -1/n \le x \le 0 \\
            n - n^2x & \text{if } 0 \le x \le +1/n \\
            0 & \text{everywhere else} \end{cases}
$$
The only thing that distinguishes $g_n(x)$ from $D_n(x)$ is that the maximum of
the former is shifted an infinitesimal distance $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
1/(2n)$ with respect to the maximum of the latter at $x=0$. So it's easy to
see that these functions become one and the same for $n \rightarrow \infty$:
$$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} g_n(x) =
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} D_n(x) = \delta(x)
$$
Therefore, in the end, we have two arguments that, unfortunately, also
lead to different outcomes for the iterated limit. According to standard mathematics, the iterated limits do not commute:
    $$\int_0^1 \left[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} g_n(x) \right] \, dx = 0
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[ \int_0^1 g_n(x) \, dx \right] = 1 $$ According to this physicist, the iterated limits do commute :
    $$\int_0^1 \left[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} g_n(x)  \right] \, dx = 1
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[ \int_0^1 g_n(x) \, dx  \right] = 1 $$ And the question is, of course the following.

I just don't see the exact relation/difference between the two definitions. I've asked two different professors to explain this to me but neither of their explanations helped. Edit: Attempting to show that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence
if $f_n$ converges uniformly to f, then $\sup\{|f_n(x)-f(x)| : x\in X \}$ for $n\ge N$. Thus, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ for $n\ge N$, which is the definition of pointwise convergence.","['uniform-convergence', 'analysis']"

If we were to take an open subset $K$ of a compact subset $Y$ in a metric space $X$, where $K$ is open relative to $X$, then every finite subcover of $Y$ would also be a finite subcover of $K$.
