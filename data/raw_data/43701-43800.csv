Calculus: Early Transcendentals (6 edn 2007) . p. 1068. ยง16.5, Exercise #27. $\nabla \cdot \color{green}{(\mathbf{F} {\times} \mathbf{G})} = \partial_h\color{green}{\epsilon_{hij}F_iG_j}$ $ = \epsilon_{hij}\partial_h[F_iG_j]$ $ = \color{purple}{\epsilon_{hij}G_j\partial_hF_i} \color{red}{+} \epsilon_{hij}F_i\partial_hG_j $ $\color{purple}{1. \text{How do I determine whether } \epsilon_{hij}G_j\partial_hF_i =   \mathbf{G} \times \nabla \mathbf{F} \text{ or } \mathbf{G} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) ?}$ $\color{darkred}{\text{3. The answer shows a negative sign $-$, not +. What did I miss?}}$ I read this . My guess One answer to my question 1 is that the divergence of a vector field, ie $\nabla \mathbf{F}$ , is always a scalar. So taking its cross product is nonsensical. This is why $ \color{purple}{ \mathbf{G} \times \nabla \mathbf{F} } $ is wrong. First Attempt Recanted due to celtschk's Answer: I tried to compute $\operatorname{div}(\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{G})$ by considering the $j$ th component term in the sum of the divergence operator: $\color{red}{[}\nabla \cdot \color{green}{(\mathbf{F} {\times} \mathbf{G})}\color{red}{]}_\color{red}{\LARGE{j}} = \partial_\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}{\epsilon_{hi\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}}}F_{\huge{\color{green}{i}}}G_{\huge{\color{green}{i}}} = \color{green}{\epsilon_{hi\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}}}\partial_\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}[F_{\huge{\color{green}{i}}}G_{\huge{\color{green}{i}}}] = \color{purple}{\epsilon_{hi\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}}G_i\partial_\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}F_i} \color{brown}{+} \color{gray}{\epsilon_{hi\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}}F_i\partial_\color{red}{\LARGE{j}}G_i} $ Supplement due to Muphrid and celtschk: $1.1.$ Without geometric calculus or wedge products or any more advanced topics, how can I  divine to move $G_h$ to the front, as Muphrid did? $3.1.$ In $\color{purple}{F_i\partial_hG_j}$ , the order of the subscripts is $\color{purple}{(i, h, j)}$ But in $\epsilon_{hij}$ , the order is $(h, i, j)$ . Thus, I must rotate $(h, i, j)$ to obtain $\color{purple}{(i, h, j)},$ by swapping $\color{purple}{h}$ and $\color{purple}{i}$ once $\Longrightarrow \epsilon_{hij} = -\epsilon_{\color{purple}{ihj}} $ . This yields the required answer. Must [the order of the subscripts of the components] = [the order of the subscripts in the Levi-Civita symbol]? Why does this work? Supplement due to Muphrid's Comment on July 17th: $3.2.$ How can I divine to pull $G_j$ to the front, and NOT the back? You did: $\color{purple}{\epsilon_{hij}G_j\partial_hF_i} = \color{purple}{(\epsilon_{hij}\partial_hF_i)G_j} = \color{purple}{G_j\epsilon_{\color{magenta}{jhi}}\partial_hF_i = \mathbf{G} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})}. $ I would've computed: $\color{purple}{\epsilon_{hij}G_j\partial_hF_i} = \color{purple}{(\epsilon_{hij}\partial_hF_i)G_j = (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{G}. \text{ But this is wrong! }}$ Supplement due to celtschk & Muphrid's Comments on July 22nd From celtschk: It is also not strictly required that the order of indices maps the order in the vector expression. However it helps to do that because it's less error prone... From Muphrid: Yes, the order of indices in the Levi-Civita matters... $3.3. $ Don't these two comments contradict? Must [the order of the subscripts of the components] = [the order of the subscripts in the Levi-Civita symbol] ? $3.4.$ Ought the order for both match?

To show, that $S$ is an orthonormal system is easy. But I have problems to show, that the span of $S$ is dense in $L^2[0,\pi]$. I could already show that $\left\|\tfrac1\pi\right\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left|\langle\tfrac 1\pi,\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{\pi}}\sin(kx)\rangle\right|^2$. Does this imply that $\tfrac1\pi$ is in the closure of the span of $S$? So am I right that the only think left to show for me is $\left\|\cos(2mx)\right\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left|\langle\cos(2mx),\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{\pi}}\sin(kx)\rangle\right|^2$? (which I couldn't do so far) My idea is to prove that $B$ is in the closure of the span of S and thus the span of $S$ dense in $L^2[0,\pi]$ (because the span of $B$ is dense in $L^2[0,\pi]$).","['fourier-series', 'orthonormal', 'functional-analysis']"
434481,Computing a contraction of an exceptional divisor.,"For a few days, I have been working on the following problem, from Qing Liu's book: Let $\mathcal{O_K}$ be a discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter t and residue characteristic $\neq 2,3$. Let $X = Proj \mathcal{O}_K[u,v,w] /(u^2w+v^3+t^6w^3)$. Determine the minimal desingularization of X. I have been able to desingularize X by blowing it up first at $(t,u,v)$ to obtain $\widetilde{X}$and then, calling the additional coordinates in the blow-up by $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, blowing $\widetilde{X}$ up at $(t,x_2,x_3)$ and then normalizing the corresponding scheme one gets. Let  us call this scheme, obtained from two blow-ups and normalizing for $Z$, and the scheme we get from blowing up twice for $Y$. I then got that:
$$Z = Proj \widetilde{X}[v_1,v_2,v_3]/(v_1x_2-tv_2,v_1x_3-tv_3,v_2x_3-v_3x_2,v_1v_2^2+v_3^3+v_1^3)$$
and
$$\widetilde{X} = Proj X[x_1,x_2,x_3]/(x_1u-tx_2,x_1v-tx_3w,x_2^2w+x_3^2v+t^4x_1^2).$$
However, I might have made a mistake , but I believe Z to be regular. Now, one can check that there is an exceptional E divisor in $Z_k$, in $Z$ has defining equations $$(t,u,v,v_1,v_3).$$ I want to contract this E, so I should find an ample effective cartier divisor D such that $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)$ is generated by global sections, $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)_{Z_K}$ (restriction to the generic fiber) is ample, $Supp D \cap E = \emptyset$ and for any other curve on $Z$, the restriction of $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)$ to it is ample. Now, I get that we should look for such a divisor in the generic fiber, and I believe that I might have found a candidate, namely $D=(v_3+v_1,v_2)$. I also believe that by Riemann-Rochlike theorems, $3D$ should be ample and generated by global sections. However, here is my problem: I want to see, in concrete, how I can calculate the contraction morphism AND the resulting scheme one gets. I just don't want to wave my hands and say that we contract, I would like to do one calculation in all detail, just to know how it works. But when I have been trying to do this, I get hopefully stuck, and I end up getting nowhere. Since my computational powers fail me, I would be more than thankful for someone taking their time and actually showing me how this calculation is done. Thank you for your time. Update: I believe that the normalization can be wrong, but I am not sure.","['arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'surfaces']"
434544,Is the intersection of an arbitrary collection of semirings a semiring?,"A semiring (of sets) is a nonempty class $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of the whole space $X$ that is closed under intersections and is such that any difference of two sets in $\mathcal{P}$ can be expressed as a finite disjoint union of sets in $\mathcal{P}$. Motivation for this question: for any class $\mathcal{E}$ of subsets of the whole space $X$, does there exist a unique smallest semiring containing $\mathcal{E}$? In other words, does there exist such a thing as the semiring generated by $\mathcal{E}$? I believe the answer is ""no,"" but I don't really have a good reason why. The actual question: Normally, to prove the existence of rings (or fields, I'll just stick to rings for simplicity) generated by a set $\mathcal{E}$, we first show that the intersection of an arbitrary collection of rings is again a ring. My hunch is that this result does not hold for semirings, and is the reason why there (possibly) does not exist such a thing as a semiring generated by $\mathcal{E}$. Let $\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ be a semiring for every $\gamma$ in some index set $\Gamma$. Define $\mathcal{P} = \cap \{\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}: \gamma \in \Gamma\}$. Then if $E, F \in \mathcal{P}$, we have that $E,F \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ for every $\gamma$. Then by the definition of semiring for each $\gamma$ there exists a disjoint collection of sets $\{E_{n_{\gamma}}\} \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ such that $E-F = \cup E_{n_{\gamma}}$ (for each $\gamma$ this sequence may be different). But for some reason I'm having trouble seeing why I can't take this disjoint sequence $\{E_{n_{\gamma}}\}$ to be common across $\gamma$. If I can, then it follows that an intersection of an arbitrary collection of semirings is a semiring, and then it follows that generated semirings exist. But I'm becoming convinced that they don't exist. Can anyone point out where I'm tripping up?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Since [$\color{#007FFF}{F_j}$ corresponding to $\color{#007FFF}{\mathbf{F}}$] appears before [$\color{#FF00FF}{\partial_if}$ corresponding to $\color{#FF00FF}{\nabla f}$], thus ${\epsilon_{ij\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}}\color{#007FFF}{F_j}\color{#FF00FF}{\partial_if}} = {\color{green}{[}\color{#007FFF}{\mathbf{F}} \times \color{#FF00FF}{\nabla f}\color{green}{]} _{\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}}}$. But the answer states $\color{green}{[}\nabla f \times \mathbf{F}\color{green}{]} _{\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}}$. What went wrong? $\large{\text{Supplement to Andrew D's response :}}$ Here's my understanding of your answer : In ${\epsilon_{ij\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}}F_j\partial_if}, \; {(i, j, \LARGE{\color{green}{k}})}$ (in the subscript of the Levi-Civita symbol) denotes the order of the components. So the $i$th component must appear first, and the $j$th component second. However, since $(i, j, k) = \color{brown}{(j, k, i)}$, therefore  $\epsilon_{ijk} = \epsilon_{\color{brown}{\LARGE{jki}}}$. $\color{brown}{\text{Now, $j$ precedes $i$, so wouldn't this result in the wrong order of the components?}}$ $\large{\text{2nd Supplement to Andrew D's Comment beneath his Answer :}}$ $\color{#3EB489}{\text{The variable in the permutation succeeding the variable that's not summed}}$ corresponds to the first component to appear. Here, $k$ denotes the component being analysed so is not summed. Since I am looking at $\color{brown}{(j, k, i)}$, $\color{#3EB489}{i}$ succeeds $k$ so the $\color{#3EB489}{i}$th component is the first. Therefore, ${\epsilon_{ijk}F_j\color{#3EB489}{\partial_{\LARGE{i}}}f}$ = ${\epsilon_{\color{brown}{\LARGE{jki}}}\color{#3EB489}{\partial_{\LARGE{i}}}F_jf} = \color{green}{[}\color{#3EB489}{\nabla f} \times \mathbf{F}\color{green}{]} _{\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}} $ However, this appears to discord with Steven Stadnicki's 2nd comment, according to which: $ {\epsilon_{\color{brown}{\LARGE{jki}}}F_j\partial_if} = {\color{green}{[}\mathbf{F} \times \nabla f\color{green}{]} _{\LARGE{\color{green}{k}}}}$?",['multivariable-calculus']

434687,Equivalence between Ext and Hom,"This is a question from Homology by Saunders Mac Lane. This is problem 5 page 76. I've been struggling to solve this problem for like more than a day, but still nothing valuable comes across my mind yet. Problem For $p$ prime, and $C$ an Abelian group such that $pC = 0$ , prove that: $$\mbox{Ext}_\mathbb{Z}(C; G) \cong \mbox{Hom}(C; G/pG)$$ I've made a couple of attempts, but all of them fail. Firstly, I try to find some connections between the elements in $\mbox{Ext}_\mathbb{Z}(C; G)$ , and the elements in $\mbox{Hom}(C; G/pG)$ . The elements of $\mbox{Ext}_\mathbb{Z}(C; G)$ is a short exact sequence of Abelian groups $0 \to G \to W \to C \to 0$ , with $W$ varies. So given this exact sequence, how can I manage to find a homomorphism from $C$ to $G/pG$ ? And vice versa, given a homomorphism, how can I deduce a short exact sequence? Secondly, I try to make use of the fact that $pC = 0$ . Although I know that $C$ can only be some group of orders $p^k$ , can I deduce that $C = \bigoplus\mathbb{Z}_p$ , or is it $C = \prod\mathbb{Z}_p$ ? That's all I have in mind till now. :( Is there some other way that to look at this problem? Thanks very much, And have a good day, :* Edit (July, 03) I've managed to prove the problem for the simpliest case, i.e, for $C = \mathbb{Z}_p$ , i.e, to prove: $$\mbox{Ext}_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G) \cong \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G/pG)$$ I hope someone can have a quick look over the proof. Consider the short exact sequence: $$0 \to p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0$$ Apply $\mbox{Ext}^n(-; G)$ to the above ses (? is this the right way to say it) , gives the long one: $$0 \to \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G) \to \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}; G) \xrightarrow{\chi} \mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}; G) \xrightarrow{\sigma} \mbox{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G) \to \mbox{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}; G) = 0$$ Hence $\sigma$ is epic, we'll have: $\mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}; G)/\mbox{Im} \chi \cong \mbox{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G)$ . Notice that a group homomorphism $f$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $G$ is completely determined if we know $f(1)$ , similarly any $g: p\mathbb{Z} \to G$ will be determined by $g(p)$ . So, in fact, we'll have $\mbox{Im}(\chi) = \left\{ f: p\mathbb{Z} \to G \middle| f(p) \in pG\right \}$ . And hence, 2 classes of $f$ , and $g$ in $\mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}; G)/\mbox{Im}$ will be congruent iff $f - g \in \mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}, pG)$ . So: $\mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}; G)/\mbox{Im} \chi \cong \mbox{Hom}(p\mathbb{Z}; G/pG) \cong \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}; G/pG)$ , since $\mathbb{Z} \cong p\mathbb{Z}$ as Abelian groups. And moreover, one should notice that, for every $f \in \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}; G/pG)$ , and for every $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ , such that $(m - n) \vdots p$ , then $f(m) = f(n)$ . Which, in turns means that, $\mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}; G/pG) \cong \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G/pG)$ . Hence, it's done. And I've found this pdf http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/classes/handout/torext.pdf , which says that: $$\mbox{Ext}\left( \bigoplus A_i; B\right) \cong \prod \mbox{Ext}\left( A_i; B\right)$$ So if it's true that $pC = 0 \Leftrightarrow C = \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}_p$ , if so, then everything should be pretty clear. Questions So some of my concerns left are: ""Apply $\mbox{Ext}^n (-; G)$ to..."" is this the right way to say it? Does the proof I gave for $\mbox{Ext}_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G) \cong \mbox{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p; G/pG)$ look correct? Can it be shortened? I know that $\mbox{Ext}\left( \bigoplus A_i; B\right) \cong \prod \mbox{Ext}\left( A_i; B\right)$ , but is it also true that $\mbox{Ext}\left( \prod A_i; B\right) \cong \bigoplus \mbox{Ext}\left( A_i; B\right)$ ? Can you guys guide me to some article, or some book, or website that have a proof to that? Or, can you guys just give me some hints on proving them? Is it true that $pC = 0 \Leftrightarrow \left[ \begin{array}{l} C = \oplus\mathbb{Z}_p \\ C = \prod \mathbb{Z}_p \end{array} \right.$ ?

Matsunaga Yoshisuke] for finding two numbers whose squares sum to a given integer $p$.  Dickson's source Mikami can be found describing the Matsunaga method in entry 15 on page 233 here: http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ACD4271.0008.001/244?rgn=full+text;view=pdf Quoting: ``To solve the equation $x^2+y^2=k$, let $\tfrac{1}{2}k$ be $=r^2+R$, where $r^2$ is the greatest square contained in $k$.  Form the quantities $$ a_1 = 2r-1 \quad a_2 = a_1 - 2 \quad a_3 = a_2 -2 \ldots $$
$$ b_1 = 2r+1 \quad b_2 = b_1 + 2 \quad b_3 = b_2 + 2 \ldots $$ and from $2R=A$ successively subtract $b_1$, $b_2$, $\ldots$.  When these subtractions are impossible, successively add $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$ and carry out the subtractions.  If we come at last to a remainder that vanishes, let the values of $a$ and $b$ employed in the last place be $a'$ and $b'$.  Then $x = \tfrac{1}{2}(a'+1)$ and $y = \tfrac{1}{2}(b'-1)$ is a solution required."" I have a lot of questions about this, but I'll start with:
Can you make this work?  I've tried several different interpretations of the instructions but have been unable to make it work to produce the representations $5 = 1^2 + 2^2$, $10 = 1^2 + 3^2$, $13 = 2^2 + 3^2$, $17 = 4^2 + 1^2$, $41 = 4^2 + 5^2$, ... in a reliable manner.  I desire a systematic way to follow these instructions that produces each of these representations (and others, if possible!).  Or perhaps this does not work for all $k$ (i.e., the remainder 0 is not reached).  But an exposition of how it works when it does work would be appreciated. Incidentally, the wording differs slightly from that given by Dickson.  I doubt he would include this result as stated if it didn't hold some merit.

For now I'm happy with Spivak's definition because I've not seen general topology yet, but I'm curious with one thing: these two definitions are equivalent? In other words, every topological space with those three properties is metrizable, so that it can be put in terms of the first definition?

For instance, I fit a normal distribution to a probability vector on N values (a probability mass function). This vector contains normalised values of the actual frequency counts in a histogram with N bins. The normalisation is done by dividing each frequency count by the discrete integral ""area"" of the pmf - so that the pmf values sum to 1.

The blast wave also reaches the observer directly, but the mach stem effect is concerned with the constructive interference between this and the reflected wave.)

Standard arguments show that $[KL:F]$ must be in $\{p,2p,\ldots,p^2\}$. But are all these multiples attained for every $p$? I.e. for all primes $p$ and for all integers $1\leq r\leq p$, do there exist $K$, $L$, and $F$ as above with $[KL:F]=rp$? Stating this in terms of Galois theory (using the fact that every prime-degree extension is separable), does there exist a group $G$ with index-$p$ subgroups $H_1,H_2$ of $G$ such that $|G:H_1\cap H_2|=rp$? Edit (I'm not sure whether this should be in an answer or not): It's straightforward to show that if $KL/F$ is Galois, so that $G$ is its Galois group, then either $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$: Assume $r\neq p$. By Sylow's theorems, $n_p:=\text{number of Sylow }p\text{-groups}$ is congruent to $1$ mod $p$ and divides $r$. But $r<p$, so $n_p=1$. Thus, there's a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow $p$-subgroup $P\cong Z_p$. So, $G= P\rtimes H_1=P\rtimes H_2$. If $(r,p-1)=1$, then there's no nontrivial homomorphism from either $H_1$ or $H_2$ to $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p)\cong Z_{p-1}$, and so the semidirect products are in fact direct. But then (since $r\neq p$) $H_1$ and $H_2$ are normal Hall subgroups of the same order and therefore equal, which can only happen if $r=1$. Thus, $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$.

It has a couple of distinct advantages over other methods: being very fast to calculate (at least in Mathematica) and it can handle any number of dimensions. Questions I need a similar fast method to calculate the volume of precisely these kinds of n-dimensional solids. The approach to finding the center of mass seems promising, but I'm not familiar enough with the ideas behind it to work it all out by myself.  I keep taking the pieces of this approach apart trying to understand it more clearly, but can't think of a way through it. Breaking down the problem into more manageable parts might help.  Wikipedia shows a formula to calculate the volume of a regular n dimensional simplex with unit side length as: This leaves figuring out how to calculate the orthogonal ""cap"". The Cholesky decomposition approach does seem promising.  I wondered if anyone had some insight into how to apply this (or an equally speedy) approach to calculating the volumes of such solids? Additional information that might lead to a simpler solution: Some discussion around the original MathForum question suggested that one could calculate  the volume of the kinds of solids described above by taking the hyperarea of the base and multiplying it by the average of the heights. Wolfram Alpha provides a formula for calculating the ""hyper-surface area"" of a simplex: As I only need this for a unit simplex (all sides = 1), I think this simplifies to: Symbolically, in Mathematica code, for n=3 with a base simplex of n-1 dimensions  it looks like this: hyperarea[n_] := Sqrt[(2^(1 - n) *n)] *(n + 1) * 1^(n - 1) / (n-1)! 

heights = {h1, h2, h3};
hyperarea[n]* Mean@heights Plug in some simple values for the heights: heights = {1, 2, 3};
n = Length[heights];
N[hyperarea[n]* Mean@heights]

3.4641 BUT, this does not seem to work correctly. Take a simple example of this kind of solid, a prism with equilateral triangle for the base and top and all edges = 1.  Its volume should equal: (1^2) * Sqrt[3]/4 * 1 = 0.433013 But when I use the hyperarea approach with heights {1, 1, 1}, I get 1.73205. Any thoughts and guidance on what I've missed appreciated.

\end{equation}
where $u,u' \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^+)$ and $a,r >0$. I have found the following not rigorous proof. By reversing the order of integration (this is the not rigorous part) one obtains:
$$
\ldots = \frac{2}{\pi}  \int_0^\infty \left ( \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos kr\cos kr' - ak \sin kr \cos kr'}{k^2a^2 +1} dk \right ) [u(r')-au'(r') ] dr';
$$
By using the Werner formulas, the integral in $dk$ becomes:
\begin{align*}
&  \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos k(r + r') + \cos k(r - r') - ak \sin k(r+r') - ak \sin k(r-r')}{2(k^2a^2 +1)} dk.

$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos kx}{a^2 k^2 +1} dk = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{e^{-|x/a|}}{a}; \; \; 
\int_0^\infty \frac{ak \sin kx}{a^2 k^2 +1} dk = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\text{sgn}(x)e^{-|x/a|}}{a};
$$
the complete formula becomes:
\begin{align*}
&\ldots = \int_0^\infty \Theta(r'-r) \frac{e^{-(r'-r)/a}}{a}[u(r')-au'(r') ] dr' = \\
& - \int_r^\infty \partial_{r'}[ e^{-(r'-r)/a}u(r') ]dr'= - e^{-(r'-r)/a}u(r')  \Big |_{r'=r}^\infty = u(r).
\end{align*} I think that reversing the order of integration is not allowed, because the conditions for Fubini are not satisfied. In fact, probably: \begin{equation}

435211,Why Euler angles cause gimbal lock?,"And here's another one about Euler angles. I want to ensure I'm understanding it right. I had a really hard time getting how and why gimbal lock is possible, because the most common explanation is ""loosing one degree of freedom"" or something like ""two axes are in the same plate"". Explanations like ""map from Euler angles is not a covering map for rotation space"" sounds good, but still doesn't reveal the reason. Then, I've read Wikipedia once again and saw this: ""Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves."" And then it hit me. When I was looking at all the pictures from all the articles and books, I saw something like this: And I thought, that Euler angles are based on co-moving frame  (so did a couple of my friends I asked, for that matter). But they are not! And from that moment everything seemed obvious! If one axes is global and two others are co-moving, then they can become aligned and we have a gimbal lock. So, here are my questions: Am I right at all, and this is the basic reason for gimbal lock in Euler angles? Will any rotation representation based on 3 orthogonal axes from one frame be gimbal-lock-free? Not only quaternions, but rotational matrices for example? WHY OH WHY did Euler used those, let's say, strange set of axes?! WHY OH WHY isn't it written in capsbold in every article about Euler angles, why all the pictures are so confusing?!

Suppose $T$ contains an infinite set with no limit point. Then $T$ contains a countable set
$X=\{x_1,x_2,...\}$ with no limit point. But then the sets 
$ X_n=\{x_n,x_{n+1},... \} $ form a centered system of closed sets in $T$ (every finite intersection is nonempty) with an empty intersection, i.e. $T$ is not compact. My questions are: I don't understand why the sets $X_n$ are closed. If we take the interval $[0,1]$ with the usual topology and the sequence $x_n=1/n$, then the intersection of all the $X_n$ should be the empty set since it can't be a positive number because taking $n$ sufficiently large that number won't be in an infinite collection of the $X_n$ and neither can be zero since $0$ is not in any of the sets. Am I understanding the concept of intersection of an infinite collection of sets? Alternatively I have thought of this proof: assume that the theorem is false , then for every point in $T$ we can take a neighborhood containing at most a finite number of points of $X$, in this way we obtain a covering of $T$, extracting a finite subcovering, at least one of the neighborhoods must contain an infinite number of points of $X$, contradiction.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

I tried to solve it myself (see below) but did not succeed. It could be just a notation problem. The Setup: Let $u \in H^1(\Omega,\mathbb{C})$ where $\Omega = [-\pi,\pi]^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. In [1, Rmk.4.2] the authors denote by $Ju$ the 2-form \begin{equation} Ju \equiv \frac{1}{2} d(u \times du) = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 3} (\partial_i u \times \partial_j u) dx_i \wedge dx_j. \end{equation} Furthermore they define \begin{equation} \zeta_1(x)= - x_2 dx_1 \wedge dx_2 - x_3 dx_1 \wedge dx_3. \end{equation} From this definition it follows that \begin{equation} \star \zeta_1 = -x_2 dx_3 + x_3 dx_2 \end{equation} which I checked. Here $\star$ denotes the Hodge-star-operator. I then calculated \begin{equation} d(\star \zeta) = -2dx_2 \wedge dx_3 \tag{G1}\end{equation} which I hope is correct. Now the authors state that \begin{equation} (u \times du) \wedge d(\star \zeta_1) = 2 \langle i \partial_1 u, u \rangle dx_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_3 \tag{G2}  \end{equation} My Question: What is $u \times du$ supposed to be? My Attempt: I tried to find out myself, but I discovered the following difficulty: Let $\omega=\sum_{i=1}^3 \omega^i dx_i$ be the 1-Form $\omega=u \times du$. Then \begin{equation} \frac{1}{2} d\omega = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{1 \leq i< j \leq 3} \omega^i_{x_j} dx_j \wedge dx_i\stackrel{!}{=} Ju = \sum_{1\leq i < j\leq 3} (\partial_i u \times \partial_j u) dx_i \wedge dx_j.  \end{equation} This suggests that $\omega_{x_j}^i = -2 (\partial_i u \times \partial_j u)$. On the other hand because of $(G1)$ equation $(G2)$ becomes \begin{equation} \omega \wedge d(\star \zeta) = -2\omega^1dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3 \stackrel{!}{=} 2 \langle i \partial_1 u, u \rangle dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3, \end{equation} which suggests $\omega^1=-\langle i \partial_1 u, u \rangle$.

435372,Dual and completion of metric spaces,"Say we have a metric space $(M,d)$, and we want to complete it in the following sense: Definition : A completion of $(M,d)$ is a complete metric space $(\widetilde{M},d')$ together with a Lipschitz funcion $i:M\rightarrow\widetilde{M}$ such that for every other complete metric space $(N,\rho)$ together with a Lipschitz function $f:M\rightarrow N$, there exists an unique Lipschitz function $F:\widetilde{M}\rightarrow N$ such that $F\circ i=f$. This definition is adapted from the definition for uniform spaces ( wikipedia ). I changed the condition that the functions are uniformly continuous to Lipschitz so any two completions of a metric space would be ""equivalent"" as metric spaces, and not just be ""uniformly equivalent"". One could also suppose the functions are isometries, for example. (I think the better ""morfisms"" in the category of metric spaces are Lipschitz functions.) The usual completion of $M$ is defined to be (a quotient of) the set $\widetilde{M}$ of Cauchy sequences on $M$ with the (pseudo)metric $d'\left((x_n)_n,(y_n)_n\right)=\lim d(x_n,y_n)$ and the inclusion $i:x\in M\mapsto (x)_n\in\widetilde{M}$ (it's the same as the one given in wikipedia). However, suppose we are working with a normed (vector) space, let's say $(X,\Vert\cdot\Vert)$. The completion of $X$ (making the proper adaptations in the definition: that the functions are linear, etc...) can be very easily defined as the closure of $ev(X)$ as a subspace of $X''$, where $Y'$ denotes the dual of a normed space $Y$ with the operator norm, and $ev:X\rightarrow X''$ is the evaluation function: $ev(x)(f)=f(x)$ for every $x\in X$ and $f\in X'$. My question is: would we be able to make a similar construction for general metric spaces, that is, to find a nice definition of dual of a metric space for which the dual of it would be a complete metric space? If so, we could try to just define the completion of $M$ as the closure of $ev(M)$ in $dual(dual(M))$. In other words, I would like to find a kind of (nice) (algebraic, analytic, etc..) structure so the category of sets with that structure is dual to the category of metric spaces. The first possible ""dual"" of $(M,d)$ that comes to my mind is $C_b(M)$, the set of continuous bounded functions from $M$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with the $\infty$-norm. Problem is that this is a commutative, unital $C^*$-Algebra, and we know the natural dual of a commutative $C^*$-Algebra is a compact hausdorff topological space, not a metric space.

Prove that: $$\mbox{Ext}(P; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{(p)}/\mathbb{Z}$$ Ok, I know some strategies when doing problems on Ext is to find a ses with projective, or injective modules, then just kind of applying $\mbox{Ext}(-; A)$, and $\mbox{Ext}(A; -)$ to arrive at the les, and work from there. Here's what I have tried, not much though. :( I've found the ses for $\mathbb{Z}^{(p)}$, i.e:
$$0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}^{(p)} \to \mathbb{Z}^{(p)} / \mathbb{Z} \to 0$$ The problem is, if I work with that ses, then I have to apply $\mbox{Ext}(P; -)$ to the sequence. But there is no injective $\mathbb{Z}-$module there, so there's nothing that can make $\mbox{Ext}(P; \mbox{something injective}) = 0$. I also try to find a ses for $P$, but its definition confuses me. I know that every module $M$ can be embedded in $0 \to S \to F \to M \to 0$ for some projective $F$, but how should I use the definition of $P$ to find a 'good' ses like that? I think I'm not seeing something here, or maybe I'm going on the wrong track. So any hints would be great. :* Thank you very much, And have a good day,","['p-adic-number-theory', 'abelian-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'modules']"
