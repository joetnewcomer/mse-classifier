2388918,Does $\lim_{x \to +\infty} 2g(2x) - g(x) = 0$ imply $\lim_{x \to +\infty} g(x) = 0$?,"Suppose I have a function $g :Â [0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$ such that 
$$
\lim_{x \to +\infty} 2g(2x) - g(x) = 0,
$$
and for every $M>0$, the restriction $g\vert_{[0,M]}$ is bounded (for instance, this is the case if $g$ is continuous).
Does it follow that $ \lim_{x \to +\infty} g(x) = 0$ ? I know that $$4g(4x)-g(x) = 2(2g(4x) - g(2x)) + (2g(2x)-g(x)) \to 0, \quad
x \to \infty$$ so $2^n g(2^n x) - g(x) \to 0$ for any $n \geq 1$.
If $g$ is bounded from above by $B>0$, then $|g(2^n x)| \leq \left| \dfrac{2^n g(2^n x) - g(x)}{2^n} \right| + \dfrac{B}{2^n}$, so I guess by taking $x$ and $n$ large enough, we can get $g(x) \to 0$. What about the general case?","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

2388938,Is there any surface (or general manifold) on which the value of $\pi$ is rational?,"Let $X(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))$ be some map $X:U\to S$ Let $\pi(u,v,d):=C(u,v,d)/d$, with the following definitions: A ""circle""  is the set of all points $p\in S$ of distance $d/2$ to some fixed point $q=X(u,v)$ (where distance is measured using the metric $G=dX^TdX$), And $C(u,v,d)$ is the arclength of the curve (parameterized in local coordinates by $\gamma(u,v,d)$) defined by this set. (Feel free to suggest other more general definitions if you think they might be helpful) First off: Is there any surface other than the plane for which $\pi(u,v,d)=const$? Is there any other surface on which $\pi(u,v,d)=\pi(u,v)$ (i.e. its constant per point) I'm essentially asking if the fact that $\pi$ is irrational is somehow ""built-in"" to reality, or are there some more ""rational"" realities where, say, $\pi==22/7$. ~ Appendix: I'm reminded vaguely of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions (and solutions of the heat equation), which states that the mean value of any harmonic function $f$ over any set of concentric circles is constant. Assuming this even applies in the case of a harmonic function over some general metric space (does it?), can we somehow interpret $C/d$ as the (reciprocal?) mean value over circles of a harmonic function, and thereby at least prove (2)? The mean around some point $(u,v)$ would be calculated as: $\mu(u,v,d)=\frac{\int_\gamma f(\gamma(u,v,d)) ds}{C(u,v,d)}$ Perhaps the above question can then be rephrased as follows: Is there any surface on which we can define some harmonic function for which $\mu(u,v,d)=d/C(u,v,d)$, in which case we get by the mean value theorem that $\pi$ is constant per point, and further is there any such surface+harmonic function combination for which $\mu(u,v,d)=d/C=const.$ ?","['harmonic-functions', 'metric-spaces', 'differential-geometry', 'pi']"

2388980,Limit of product of sequences is the product of the limits of the sequences,"I want to prove that if: $$\lim_{n \to \infty}s_n = L_1, \lim_{n \to \infty}t_n = L_2$$ then $$\lim_{n \to \infty}(s_n t_n) = L_1L_2$$ where $s_n, t_n$ are complex sequences (I'm working through Rudin's baby rudin, and I did this proof slightly different than him, so I would like it if someone took the time to look through my proof and verify whether it's correct) My attempt (scratch proof: finding the appropriate epsilons etc): By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2$ such that: $$n >N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| <\epsilon'$$
$$n >N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| <\epsilon''$$ where we can freely choose $\epsilon', \epsilon'' >0$ Let $\epsilon > 0$ Now, if $n > \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, then: $$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$
$$\leq |s_n||t_n - L_2| + |L_2||s_n - L_1|$$
$$\leq |s_n|\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon'$$ We want this expression to be smaller than $\epsilon$, but we can't make our $\epsilon$ depend on $n$, therefore we have to find an upper bound for $|s_n|$ There is a positive integer $N_3$ such that: $$n > N_3 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| < 1$$
$$\Rightarrow |s_n| < 1 + |L_1|$$ so for $n > \max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\}$, we have: $$ |s_n|\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon' < (1 + |L_1|)\epsilon'' + |L_2|\epsilon'$$ and by chosing $\epsilon'' = \epsilon' = \frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$, the expression becomes smaller than $\epsilon$ Rigorous proof Let $\epsilon > 0$ By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2, N_3$ such that: $$n >N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| <\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$$
$$n >N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| <\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}$$
$$n > N_3 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| < 1 \Rightarrow |s_n| < 1 + |L_1|$$ and for $n > \max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\}$, we have: $$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$

$$< (1 + |L_1|)\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|} + |L_2|\frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|} = \frac{\epsilon}{1+|L_1|+|L_2|}(1+ |L_1| + |L_2|) = \epsilon$$ Alternative proof: Let $\epsilon > 0$ $(s_n)$ converges, so $(|s_n|)$ converges and it is bounded, meaning that there is a positive real number $S$ such that $|s_n| \leq S$ for every positive $n$. By definition of limit, there are positive integers $N_1,N_2$ such that: $$n >N_1 \Rightarrow |s_n - L_1| <\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|}$$
$$n >N_2 \Rightarrow |t_n - L_2| <\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|}$$ Now, for $n > \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have: $$|s_nt_n - L_1L_2| = |s_n(t_n - L_2) + s_nL_2 - L_1L_2|$$
$$\leq |s_n||t_n - L_2| + |L_2||s_n - L_1|$$
$$< (S+|L_2|)\frac{\epsilon}{S + |L_2|} = \epsilon $$ Note that this wouldn't work whenever $S + |L_2| = 0$. However, if $S=0$, then $s_n$ is the null-sequence and the theorem is trivial, so we can safely assume $S \neq 0$ such that the denominator never becomes $0$.

2389074,Multivariable derivative: Limit definition,"Consider a path through a domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $\mathbf{c}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. We wish to find the rate of change of a function $f(x,y)$ along this path. Therefore, we wish to compute $\frac{d}{dt}f(\mathbf{c}(t))$. My question is about the limit definition. My book gives the limit definition of the derivative as $$
\frac{d}{dt}f(\mathbf{c}(t)) = \lim_{h\to\ 0}\frac{f(x(t+h),y(t+h)) - f(x(t),y(t))}{h}\tag{1}$$ Question Why isn't the derivative written as:
$$\frac{d}{d\mathbf{c}'(t)}f(\mathbf{c}(t)) = \lim_{h\to\ 0}\frac{f(x(t+h),y(t+h)) - f(x(t),y(t))}{\sqrt{(x(t+h)-x(t))^2 + (y(t+h) - y(t))^2}}\tag{2}$$
$$\frac{d}{d\mathbf{c}'(t)}f(\mathbf{c}(t)) = \lim_{\Delta x,\Delta y\to\ 0}\frac{f(x(t) + \Delta x,y(t) + \Delta y) - f(x(t),y(t))}{\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}}$$
$$\Delta x = x(t+h) - x(t) \\
\Delta y = y(t+h) - y(t)$$ where $d/d\mathbf{c}'(t)$ indicates the derivative in the direction of the tangent vector of the path. After reading the comments and responses under this question, my answer to my own question (with their help) is that these two limits speak to different derivatives. The first limit indicates the rate of change of $f$ as the parameter $t$ is changed. It indicates change in $f$ per unit $t$ ($t$ usually stands for time, but as we'll see below, it's just an arbitrary parameter. $t$ doesn't have to be 'time'). This derivative will depend on how you parameterize your path. A path can be parameterized in infinitely many ways ($\mathbf{c}_2(t)$ might move along your path twice as fast as $\mathbf{c}_1(t)$ for instance). On the other hand, the second limit is simply the derivative of $f(x,y) = f(\mathbf{c}(t))$. It's just the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside variables (instead of the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside-inside variable - remember that if $f(x) = f(g(t))$, $f$ can either change directly through $x$, or indirectly through $t$. Because each case changes the function either by changing the $x$ or $t$ knob, we can ask for either $d/dx$ or $d/dt$). But back to equation $\textbf{(2)}$, since the inside variables $(x,y)$ form a path $\mathbf{c}(t)$, I don't write $\partial/\partial x$ or $\partial /\partial y$, but $d/d\mathbf{c}'(t)$ since $x,y$ are confined to change along a path. As you take the limit, you see that the derivative is in a direction tangent to your path, which is why I use $d/d\mathbf{c}'(t)$ since $\mathbf{c}'(t)$ is the tangent vector to the path. Again, the derivative represents the rate of change with respect to tangent lines to this path (you can see the direction that this derivative is taken in at a given $t$ by looking at the right hand side of equation $\textbf{(2)}$). This derivative indicates change in $f$ per unit change in tangent direction. This derivative will depend on your parameterization. Comparisons to the 1-variable case: The first limit (1) Let's discuss the first limit (the derivative of $f$ with respect to the 'inside-inside' variable. How does $f$ change indirectly through $t$). Is there a 1D analog? Yes. Consider the composite function $f(x) = f(x(t))$. What's the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$? We can write the limit definition: $$\frac{df(x(t))}{dt} = \lim_{h\to\ 0}\frac{f(x(t+h))-f(x(t))}{h}\tag{3}$$
This is indeed the 1D version of the first limit above $\textbf{(1)}$. To further drive the comparison, we know that $\frac{df}{dt} = f'(x(t))x'(t) = (df/dx)(dx/dt)$ = derivative of the outside times derivative of the inside. And in the multivariate case, that first limit can be shown to equal $\nabla f \cdot \mathbf{c}'(t)$ = derivative of the outside times derivative of the inside and do a sum for each variable. Indeed, the multivariate chain rule is in fact the generalization of the 1D chain rule. $f(x(t))$ is a composite function. But so to is $f(x(t),y(t)) = f(\mathbf{c}(t))$, just in a multivariate way. $\mathbf{c}(t)$ parameterizes how you move along the $x$ and $y$ axes. In the single variable case $f(x(t))$, we are parameterizing how we move along the only axis that $f$ has access to, which is the $x$ axis ($x = x(t)$). We usually see composite functions as $f(g(x)) = f(u)$, in which case we are parameterizing how $f$ moves along the $u$ axis with parameterization $g(x)$ (I'm just using different variables to show that a parameter is a parameter - It doesn't have to be time). Again this derivative of the 'inside-inside' variable will depend on your parameterization, which we can clearly see by looking at the 1D case (just take simple examples and see how $x'(t)$ changes). For instance, in 1D the only path you have to parameterize is the real line. That's the only path (let the path be the whole real line). Therefore different parameterizations will have different $x'(t)$. That is, different parameterizations will have different 'speeds' (again note that if $x$ is parameterized by $x(t)$, $x' = x'(t)$ is only a 'speed' if $x$ has units of meters and $t$ units of time. By 'speed' of the parameterization, I just mean derivative. To make this clearer, let $f(u) = f(g(k))$. The speed of the parameterization is $du/dk = g'(k)$). The change in $f$ per unit parameter will depend on how your path is parameterized. If $f$ is in temperature units Kelvin, $df(x(t))/dt$ could be 2 Kelvin per second for one parameterization and 3 Kelvin per second for another. Comparisons to the 1-variable case: The second limit (2) Let's look at the 1-variable case $f(u) = f(g(t))$. What is $df/du$? This is just the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside function (it's how $f$ changes directly through it's domain variables as opposed to indirectly through the parameter). It's limit definition is given by $$\frac{df(u)}{du} = \lim_{k\to\ 0}\frac{f(g(t) + k) - f(g(t))}{k}$$ 
which setting $k = g(t+h) - g(t)$ gives $$\frac{df(u)}{du} = \lim_{h\to\ 0}\frac{f(g(t+h)) - f(g(t))}{g(t+h) - g(t)}\tag{4}$$ 
Either way hopefully you can get to this line without going through the first. All you're doing is taking the function at two different values and dividing by the difference. This is the 1D analog of the second limit $\textbf{(2)}$. The main difference is that in 1D, I can only move along my parameterization, which here is the $u$ axis. Therefore I write $d/du$. In the multivariate case, again I can only move along my parameterization. However, as we take a small step size $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ allowed by my parameterization that we let go to zero (by looking at $\textbf{(2)}$ hopefully you can see that $h \to 0$ is equivalent to $\Delta x \to 0$ or $\Delta y \to 0$), we are finding the rate of change of the function $f$ in the tangent direction to the path (think of two points on your path $\mathbf{c}(t)$. Fix one and allow the other to approach it. The two points form a tangent line in the limit). Therefore, I use $d/d\mathbf{c}'(t)$ to denote direction of the derivative. It's always a direction tangent to the path and that tangent direction changes over the path. In 1D, the direction tangent to the path was just the path itself (the axis), for the whole path. This derivative $\textbf{(2)}$ and $\textbf{(4)}$) will depend on your parameterization, which we can see by taking simple examples and looking at the 1D case $\textbf{(4)}$. Equations $\textbf{(2)}$ and $\textbf{(4)}$ give the rate of change of $f$ along the tangent direction to the path (which depends on your parameterization). Equations $\textbf{(1)}$ and $\textbf{(3)}$ give the rate of change of $f$ with respect to the parameter (which also depends on your parameterization). Comments/Complaints on the Directional Derivative A pure directional derivative is given by equation $\textbf{(2)}$ where $\mathbf{c}(t)$ is a line. That's it, end of story. For a vector $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$, a parameterization along this direction is $x(t) = x + v_xt$ and $y(t) = y + v_yt$. Therefore, the directional derivative, given by equation $\textbf{(2)}$ is: $$\frac{df(x(t),y(t))}{d\vec{v}} = \lim_{h\to 0} = \frac{f(x(t) + v_xh, y(t) + v_yh) - f(x(t), y(t))}{h}$$ 
$\textbf{IF}$ $\vec{v}$ is a unit vector so that $\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ = 1. However, textbooks will sometimes define this as the directional derivative even if the vector $\vec{v}$ is not a unit vector. I'm not a fan of this because that's not what equation $\textbf{(2)}$ says to do (and I find that $\textbf{(2)}$ makes sense). Essentially what they've done is $\textbf{redefine}$ what it means to be a unit vector. This is fine, but now we take $\vec{v}$ whatever it is, to be the unit vector standard. Therefore, their derivative which is still a rate of change of $f$ per unit distance, has a different meaning of 'per unit distance' then my definition of per unit distance based on my idea of a unit vector. The reason why they do this is because they understand what they are doing (redefining what a unit vector means - which is fine - but for 1st time learners, I think it can be confusing if you don't show that the directional derivative is essentially equation $\textbf{(2)}$.)","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

2389303,What is strictly well-ordered under $\in$,"I am studying from a set of notes (otherwise quite excellent) which does not explicitly specify some definitions of ""ordering."" I have tried to accumulate the various pieces from various discussions and proofs in the text, but am having a hard time putting them together. In one place it says strictly well-orderered by $\in$ is $n\lt m$ iff $n\in m$. In another it says a well-ordered set is totally ordered in which every non-empty set has a minimal element. And one aspect of the definition of total ordering is that inequality satisfied by "" minimal "" is ""weak"" ($\leq$) rather than ""strict"" ($\lt$). Lastly, one of the two features of the definition of an ordinal is that it is strictly well-orderered by $\in$ . M confusion comes in a proof showing that an $\alpha$ is an ordinal because ""it has a minimal element and thus is well-ordered under $\in$ ."" Whereas, the definition of an ordinal says nothing about a minimal element. Are they the same thing? And why does it not say: strictly well-ordered by $\in$?

A proof can be found in this note by Hirshon. In the same note, it is shown that $\mathbb{Z}$ is not cancellable, but if we only allow $A$ and $B$ to be abelian, it is (see here ). I would like to know if there are any groups that can be cancelled from free products rather than direct products. That is: Is there a non-trivial group $C$ such that $A*C \cong B*C$ implies $A \cong B$? If it helps, I would also be interested in the case where the groups are finitely generated. It is certainly not true that every group is cancellable in free products. For example, if $A$, $B$, $C$ are the free groups on one, two, and infinitely many generators respectively, then $A*C \cong C \cong B*C$ but $A\not\cong B$. Many non-examples can be constructed this way, but they are all infinitely generated. This leads to the question: Are there finitely generated groups $A, B, C$ with $A \not\cong B$ but $A*C \cong B*C$?","['free-product', 'group-theory']"
2389407,Error in the book? Or wrong logic?,"In the book ""Elementary linear algebra with supplemental applications"", 11th edition, page 81,task 127, the following task appears: Show that if $A$ is a square matrix such that $A^K=0$ for some positive integer $K$, then the matrix $A$ is invertible and the inverse of the matrix $(I-A)$ is equal to $I + A + A^2 + ... + A^{K-1}$. I have no difficulty in arriving at the identity given that $A^K = 0$, however I think there is something wrong here... Consider the following: Let $A$ be a square matrix not equal to 0 , such that $A^K=0$ for some nonnegative integer $K \ge 2$, and assume for contradiction that $A^{-1}$ exists. Then we can deduce the following: $$A^K=0 \implies A^K A^{-1}=0 \implies A^{K-1} A A^{-1} = 0 \implies A^{K-1} I = 0$$ and we are left with $A^{K-1} = 0$. Thus, $A^K=0 \implies A^{K-1} = 0$, and using the same logic (multiplying by $A^{-1}$), we deduce $A^K=0 \implies A^{K-1} = 0 \implies \cdots \implies A^2 = 0 \implies A = 0$, a contradiction. Thus, the three statements ""$A$ does not equal $0$"", ""$A^{-1}$ exists"" and ""$A^K=0$ for some nonnegative integer $K$ greater than or equal to $2$"" cannot all be true at the same time. And thus the task in the book is inncorrect since it states that $A^{-1}$ exists. Is the book wrong, or is there something wrong with my use of logic here? :)","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
2389446,Convergence Proof: Difference within Function of Epsilon,"Here's the problem, and then my proposed proof: Suppose that $\phi : (0, \infty) \mapsto (0, \infty)$ is a function such that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\phi(\epsilon) = 0.$ Let $a_1,a_2,\dots$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Show that this sequence converges to $a$ if and only if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for $n > N$, we have $|a_n-a|\leq \phi(\epsilon).$ (from Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms (Hubbard and Hubbard)) My proof is for the first statement (the if, not the only if). First, to avoid confusion, the argument of the function $\phi$ will be renamed to $\epsilon'$.By the definition of the limit, the statement that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\phi(\epsilon) = 0$ is the same as saying that $$\forall\epsilon >0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |\epsilon'| \leq \delta \implies |\phi(\epsilon')| \leq \epsilon $$ By assumption, $|a_n - a| \leq \phi(\epsilon')$, and from the statement above, we get $$|a_n - a| \leq \phi(\epsilon') \leq \epsilon$$
We want $\phi(\epsilon') \leq \epsilon'$. However, since it must be true for all $\epsilon$ and all $\epsilon'$ greater than 0, the two can be taken to be equal. Therefore,
$$|a_n-a| \leq \epsilon'$$ I'm unsure about the final step, where I say that the unprimed and primed epsilon can be taken to be equal. Is this correct?","['epsilon-delta', 'convergence-divergence', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"

A problem like this may have been studied previously, perhaps in another guise. Any insights are appreciated. Let $S$ be a set whose elements are the $\binom{n}{k}$ $k$-subsets of some $n$-set. Let $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_t$ denote a partition of $S$. What is the smallest size of a partition (the smallest value of $t$) such that for each $i \in \{1,2,\ldots, t\}$ and each element $x$ of the $n$-set, $x$ is an element of at most $\ell$ of the $k$-subsets in $S_i$? Let $f(n,k,\ell)$ denote the smallest size of such a partition. An example for $n = 4$, $k = 2$, and $\ell = 2$: Here, $S = \{ \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{1,4\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\} \}$. We can easily see that $f(4,2,2) = 2$, as $S_1 = \{ \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{3,4\}\}, S_2 = \{ \{1,4\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,4\}\}$ is a valid partition, and no valid partition of size $1$ exists because each element appears in $3 > \ell$ sets. So far, I've just been able to determine a simple upper bound for $f(n,k,\ell)$. Let $1,2\ldots, n$ be the elements of the $n$-set. Let $X_i$, for $1 \leq i \leq n - k + 1$, be the set of subsets which contain the element $i$, and do not contain any element $j$ such that $j < i$. Then, $X_1,X_2,\ldots, X_{n - k + 1}$ is a partition of $S$. Each $X_i$ can itself be partitioned into $\alpha_i = \left \lceil \frac{|X_i|}{\ell} \right \rceil$ sets $S^i_1, S^i_2, \ldots, S^i_{\alpha_i}$ each which contain at most  $\ell$ $k$-subsets. Then the partition $S^1_1, S^1_2, \ldots, S^1_{\alpha_i}, S^2_1, S^2_2, \ldots, S^{n-k+1}_{\alpha_{n-k+1}}$ of $S$ is a partition of size $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \ldots + \alpha_{n-k+1}$ which satisfies our condition, and so $f(n,k,\ell) \leq \sum\limits^{n-k+1}_{i=1} \alpha_i$, where $\alpha_i = \left \lceil \frac{|X_i|}{\ell} \right \rceil = \left \lceil \binom{n-i}{k-1}/\ell \right \rceil$.

2390058,Prove property of integral of continuous functions,"Going over some old notes, I came across the following problem: Let $f,g$ denote continuous real functions on $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$. Prove 
    that 
    $$f(x)\int_{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt \;=\; g(x)\int_{x}^{b}f(t)\,dt$$ 
    has at least one solution on $(a,b)$. Unfortunately, I have a note (in the margin no less!) that just says ""proof follows from Rolle's theorem"". Fortunately, this proof is easier than Fermat's Last Theorem, but I wouldn't mind someone checking my logic since it's a few months since doing the course. Proof : We introduce the function:
$$\begin{aligned}
F:[a,b] &\;\longrightarrow\; \mathbb{R} \\
x &\;\longmapsto\; F(x) \;\equiv\; \left(\int_{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt\right)\left(\int_{x}^{b}f(t)\,dt\right).
\end{aligned}$$
From the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the integral of a function continuous on $[a,b]$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. It follows from the product of continuous and differentiable functions that $F$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Furthermore, $F(a)=F(b)=0$ since the limits of one of the integrals in $F$ will be the same, and hence vanish, at $x=a$ and $x=b$. Thus, $F$ satisfies the requirements of Rolle's theorem and
$$\exists\, x_{0}\in(a,b) \quad\text{s.t.}\quad F'(x_{0})\,=\, 0.$$
From the Product Rule and the Leibniz Integral Rule, we have
$$\begin{aligned}F'(x) &\;=\; \frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt\right)\cdot\left(\int_{x}^{b}f(t)\,dt\right) + \left(\int_{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt\right)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_{x}^{b}f(t)\,dt\right) \\[0.3cm]
&\;=\;  g(x)\int_{x}^{b}f(t)\,dt - f(x)\int_{a}^{x}g(t)\,dt

2390137,The (Hausdorff) moment problem for signed measures.,"Moment problems consider the problem of inverting the map which takes a measure $\mu$ to its moments.

2390149,Find the number of times $5$ will be written while listing integers from $1$ to $1000$,"Just a question and then, I'll come up with my doubt. It will be easier to explain then. Question: Find the number of times $5$ will be written while listing integers from $1$ to $1000$. Now, it can be solved in this fashion. The numbers will be of the form: $5xy, x5y, xy5$ where $x,y$ denote the two other digits such that $0\leq x,y \leq 9$. So, $x,y$ can take $10$ choice each. So, answer is $10^2$ multiplied by $3$ for the $3$ sets of numbers mentioned. Answer becomes $300$ and it's correct. But the thing is: When we are considering $x5y$, we include $557$ in this. Again, we include $557$ while considering $5xy$, right?

2390166,"Lemma 10.8 Rudin functional analysis, proof.","There's the following theorem I'm trying to understand (Lemma 10.8 Rudin, Functional Analysis). Let $f$ be an entire function on $\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(0) = 1, f'(0) = 0, 0 < \lvert f(\lambda) \rvert \leq e^{\lvert \lambda
\rvert}$ for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. Then $f(\lambda) = 1$ for
  all $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. The maximum modulus theorem is used (Theorem 10.24 Rudin, Real and Complex analysis). Suppose $\Omega$ is a region, $f \in H(\Omega)$, and $\overline{D}(a;r) \subset \Omega$. Then $$ \lvert f(a) \rvert \leq \max_{\theta} \lvert f(a + re^{i\theta}) \rvert $$ For the lemma 10.8 the proof goes as follows. Because $f$ doesn't have zeroes then there's a function $g$ such that $f = \exp\left\{ g \right\}$, $g$ entire in $\mathbb{C}$ and $Re[g(\lambda)] \leq |\lambda|$ with $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, $g(0) = g'(0) = 0$. Let $r \geq |\lambda|$, we can verify that $$
\lvert g(\lambda) \rvert \leq \lvert 2r - g(\lambda) \rvert
$$ $$
h_{r}(\lambda) = \frac{r^2g(\lambda)}{\lambda^2(2r - g(\lambda))}
$$ such a function is holomorphic in $\left\{\lambda : |\lambda| < 2r \right\}$. Clearly $\lvert h_r(\lambda) \rvert \leq 1$ if $\vert \lambda \rvert = r$. By the maximum modulus theorem we have for $\lvert \lambda \rvert \leq r$
$$
\lvert h_r(\lambda) \rvert \leq 1.
$$ If we fix $\lambda$ and let $r \to \infty$, we have $g(\lambda) = 0$. My main question is how the maximum modulus theorem is actually used in this context? My function $h_r$ is holomorphic in $\Omega = D(0;2r)$ and also I have $\overline{D}(0,r) \subset D(0;2r)$, this should imply $$
\lvert h_r(0) \rvert \leq \max_{\lambda \in \partial \overline{D}(0,r)}\lvert h_r(\lambda) \rvert \leq 1
$$ where with $\partial A$ I denote the boundary set of a set $A$. Why does this imply $\lvert h_r(\lambda) \rvert \leq 1$ if $| \lambda | \leq r$?. Also why if fix $\lambda$ and let $r$ diverging implies $g(\lambda) = 0$?","['functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'banach-algebras']"

\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\arccos\frac{n}{n+4} \right)^{\alpha}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\arccos\left(1-\frac{4}{n+4}\right)\right)^{\alpha}$$ Now I tried to see the Taylor Series of $\arccos(1-y)$ as $y\rightarrow 0$, $y=\frac{4}{n+4}$. By deriving $g(y)=\arccos(1-y)$ I obtain: $$g'(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(1-y)^2}}=(-x^2+2x)^{\frac{1}{2}}=(2x)^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-\frac{x}{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{2y}+o(\sqrt{2y})$$ So I see that: $$g(y)=\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{2y}}+o\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}\right)dx=\sqrt{2x}+o(\sqrt{2x})$$ From this, I can conclude that my series is: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\arccos\left(1-\frac{4}{n+4}\right)\right)^{\alpha} \sim \left(\sqrt{\frac{8}{n+4}}\right)^{\alpha}$$ So, for asymptotic comparison to $\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ the series converges if and only if $\alpha > 2$.

3 &= 1+2,\\
3 &= 1+1+1.\\
\end{align}
The first two are a partitioning of $3$ into $2$ nonnegative integers. The last is a partitioning into $3$ nonnegative integers. The problem statement On the other hand one could consider the number of ways to partition a number over a different set. I am interested in the case where the numbers ""doing the partitioning"" are drawn from the set
$$
S_N = [-N,\ldots,N]
$$
(with repeats allowed) and the numbers to be partitioned are $0$ and $1$. In the general case, $m$ numbers are allowed to be chosen from $S_N$ to do the partitioning. Example Suppose $N = 1$, so that $S_1 = \{-1,0,1\}$. Suppose first we look for partitions into two integers -- in other words, take $m =2$. Then $0$ can be partitioned into two integers from $S_1$ in the two distinct ways as shown below:
\begin{align}
0 &= 0 + 0 \\
0 &= 1 + (-1),
\end{align}
$1$ may be partitioned in only one way:
\begin{align}
1 &= 1 + 0. \\
\end{align}
For $m=3$, $0$ may be partitioned in two distinct ways again,
\begin{align}
0 &= 0 + 0 + 0\\
0 &= 1 + (-1) + 0,

whereas $1$ can now also be partitioned into two distinct ways,

1 &= 1 + 0 + 0\\
0 &= 1 + 1 + (-1).

Could one only rely on calculus and multivariate calculus to do this rigorous?
In introductory texts random variables are described as random functions, but their characteristics is their pmf or pdf, would this be enough? So if we only restrict ourselves to what is called discrete or continuous random variables(or vectors) in introductory statistics text, is calculus and multivariate calculus enough to get the theory to stand on its own? or will we need measure theory? If it is the case that this is impossible to do without measure theory, does this mean that most introductory texts in statistics are wrong? Since they base everything on Riemann-integrals, but the theory is wrong? UPDATE: From the discussion in the comments we see that by the definition of a probability space we need it to be a measure, and we also need the events to be a sigma-algebra. Hence we need these two concepts from measure theory. So I should have asked the question like this instead: Will the theory of continuous random variables in introductory texts work out if we only allow Riemann-integration and not Lebesgue-integration? Is the integration-theory in introductory texts in calculus which only deals with Riemann-integration enough to make sure that the theory is rigorous?","['probability-theory', 'calculus']"

2390807,Major confusion about sheaves of rings and sheaves of modules on schemes,"So this question has largely grown out of two previous questions I asked: Question about notation/conventions for localizations of R-algebras Help understanding closed subschemes and closed immersions I have identified and consolidated some of my major points of confusion. Take exercise (2.18a) from Hartshorne as an example. There I am asked to show that if I have a morphism of rings $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ with corresponding morphism of schemes $f: \text{Spec} B \longrightarrow \text{Spec}A$, then the corresponding morphism of sheaves $f^{\#}: \mathcal{O}_{Y} \longrightarrow f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}$ is injective if and only if $\phi$ is injective. Let me first lay out what I understand before getting to what is confusing me. After doing section 2.1 of Hartshorne, I felt comfortable with sheaves taking values in an abelian category. Once I got to section 2.2, however, I got a little lost. The issue that everything is done in terms of sheaves of $\textit{rings}$, which certainly do not form an abelian category (indeed we don't even have kernels!). When we take stalks of these sheaves, we find that at some point $p$ (say a prime ideal of $B$), the stalk of the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ at $p$ is the local $\textit{ring}$ $A_{p}$. This was all well and good until I came to trying to apply exactness results for localization. Returning to the exercise I mentioned above, I went about showing that the sheaf is injective on sections. I started with $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ and localized at a basic open set $D(h)$ to consider the morphism 
$$
A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)}
$$
I then thought I could just say that since localization is exact, this preserves exactness. However, I realized that this exactness result only holds for modules. That is, if I treated $B$ as a module over $A$, then it would be perfectly fine for me to claim that the map of $\textit{modules}$
$$
A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{h} \simeq A_{h} \otimes _{A} B
$$
is injective. Speaking more generally than just the exericse, what exactly can I say about morphisms of sections, and induced morphisms of stalks since they are rings, not modules. It seems like all of section 2.1 was useless. I have also been looking at the notion of base change where I hit a similar problem. Say the morphism $\phi: A \longrightarrow B$ makes $B$ into a finite-type $A$-algebra. We would like to claim that finite-type morphisms of schemes are preserved under base change. That is, we would like to be able to say that via base change, the morphism
$$
A_{h} \longrightarrow B_{\phi(h)}
$$
makes $B_{\phi(h)}$ into a finite-type $A_{h}$-algebra. I can do this the hands-on way by showing how finitely many generators of $B$ over $A$ map under localization, but I wanted to try to see this more abstractly. I wanted to see the localization $B_{\phi(h)}$ as the pushout of the diagram which would be the tensor product $A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$. Then I realized again that this would only be the case in the category of modules, which brought me back to my original confusion. Is it true that as rings, there holds $B_{\phi(h)} \simeq A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$? Or is it only true when we treat $A$ and $B$ as $\textit{modules}$ that $B_{h} \simeq A_{h} \otimes_{A} B$, in which case we could apply exactness results? I'm sorry for the long post, but this is really bugging me and I wanted to lay out as much detail as I could. I'm still not entirely sure I have asked the question exactly the right way, but I am hoping people can still clear up any confusion.","['modules', 'sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

I understand that with knowledge of the first fundamental form, we may calculate the curvature, but for this question I'm not sure how to proceed, since we don't have a priori the first fundamental form of the earth given. It seems to me like we need to find that. I saw some answers using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, but I think that deals with total curvature, and I'm speaking of Gaussian curvature (I may be wrong here, I don't really know that theorem well). Does it have something to do with measure triangles and angles? And if so, can someone help me relate this back to Gauss's theorem and the first fundamental form? Another point of confusion: How do I even know what a triangle is on an arbitrary surface? A triangle is made by connecting three points with the curve that attains the shortest possible distance between those points, right?

2390875,Confusion about Notation for Twisting Sheaf and Very Ample Invertible Sheaves,"I'm a bit confused by some notation in Hartshorne's chapter II (theorems II.5.17, II.7.6, and some discussion on ample invertible sheaves in section 7). Theorem 5.17 (Serre). Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a noetherian ring $A$ , let $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ , and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$ -module. Then there is an integer $n_0$ such that for all $n \geq n_0$ , the sheaf $\mathcal{F}(n)$ can be generated by a finite number of global sections. Proof. Let $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ be a closed immersion of $X$ into a projective space $A$ , such that $i^*(\mathcal{O}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ ... [The remainder of the paragraph is devoted to reducing to the case where $X$ is Proj of a polynomial ring.] First, what is meant by the hypothesis "" $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ "", since, a priori, $X$ is not projective space or Proj of a graded ring? I see that one can appeal to Corollary 5.16 to see that $X$ is $\mathrm{Proj}(S)$ for some graded ring $S$ , finitely generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0 = A$ -algebra. Then one can take $\mathcal{O}(1) = \widetilde{S(1)}$ . Then this is very ample since we can use the description of $S$ to construct a closed immersion $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ with $i^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_A^r}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ (by Proposition 5.12(c)), which is just $\mathcal{O}(1)$ . Is this the correct interpretation? Second, on p. 153, this result is later quoted as having established: for $\mathcal{L}$ any very ample invertible sheaf on a projective scheme $X$ over $A$ , for any coherent $\mathcal{F}$ , there is an $n_0$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^n$ is generated by global sections, which appears slightly different than the above result, since we worked with the particular very ample invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ . Based on the above argument, it seems every very ample invertible sheaf over a projective scheme (at least those coming from closed immersions coming from surjective ring maps, by proposition 5.12(c)) will be isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ . Is this true? If it's not, in what sense was the quoted result proven by theorem 5.17? Also, is this rephrasing merely meant to suggest the definition of ample provided on p. 153? Finally, I am confused about the notation found in the proof of theorem 7.6, in chapter II. The setting is $X$ a scheme of finite type over a noetherian ring $A$ , and $\mathcal{L}$ an invertible sheaf on $X$ . One direction of the theorem is that if $\mathcal{L}^m$ is very ample implies $\mathcal{L}$ is ample. The proof begins with $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^n$ , an immersion with $\mathcal{L}^m \simeq i^*(\mathcal{O}(1))$ . Then given any coherent $\mathcal{F}$ , consider the closure $\overline{X}$ in projective space and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ the coherent sheaf which is the extension of $\mathcal{F}$ to $\overline{X}$ . Then it is noted that if $\overline{\mathcal{F}} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\overline{X}}(l)$ is generated by global sections, hence $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(l)$ is also. My question is, what is the meaning of $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ ? The map $i$ is just an immersion, so we don't know that $X$ is Proj of some graded ring. Is $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ just a short-hand for $\mathcal{L}^l$ ?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

$$ Any thoughts?","['matrices', 'numerical-methods', 'gaussian-elimination']"
