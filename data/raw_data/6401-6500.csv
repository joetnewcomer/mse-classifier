47865,Are angles ever multiplied?,"I recently explained multiplication of (non-zero) complex numbers to my Mathematics Fundamentals students, the usual bit about “multiply their lengths, and add their angles”. Of course, there is always at least one student who wants to know why the angles are added instead of multiplied – after all, this is multiplication, right? – and so I go through a non-trivial example to establish that it is at least highly plausible that addition, not multiplication, of angles is what occurs. This quiets their objection, but it always gets me to wondering: Indeed, are angles EVER multiplied anywhere in Mathematics? I don’t recall ever having seen such a thing. And since this wonderful wonderland of MSE now exists, I will pass this question on to the community. Of course, there are exercises of the form “If cos(f(x)) = sin(g(x)), solve for x.”, where this could happen, but of course what I am asking is whether this happens as part of a significant theorem, or as part of solving a problem of real physical interest. The non-multiplication of angles seems all the more counter-intuitive because they are actually dimensionless, in spite of the use of dimension-sounding phraseology such as “degrees” and “radians”. So, angles are just numbers, and surely numbers can be multiplied together, right? (Of course, not being dimensionless is no barrier to getting multiplied by objects of the same/different type. After all, we deal with the square of seconds in regard to acceleration, and with the square of grams in regard to the (statistical) variance of weights, and so on. I’m just saying that it would seem all the more plausible that they would occasionally get multiplied together if they are dimensionless.) I’m going to go out on a limb and conjecture that there is no such case. The basis of my conjecture is simply that I have never seen it happen, and also the fact that angles do not exist for vectors of zero length. I know this is quite tenuous, but what I’m guessing is that only quantities that behave well for 0 are eligible, so to speak, to be multiplied together.",['analysis']

Since we can associate to every principal bundle a vector bundle (via the twisted product) and to every vector bundle a principal vector bundle, i was wondering if we can do this: Given a connection on a principal bundle, define an associated connection in the associated vector bundle, and conversely given a (linear) connection in a vector bundle, define an associated connection in the associated principal bundle.

47890,solving a problem using degrees OR radians,"hey so i'm programming something that finds an angle of a line between 0 and 180 degrees based on two points.... the equation to find the answer is Angle = sin-1((1/Hypotenuse)*B) where B is the vertical side of the triangle formed and the hypotenuse is the distance between point 1 and 2.

47910,Proving that the closure of a set contains the $\inf$ and $\sup$,"I came across the following problem about closures: If $A$ is a bounded nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$, prove that $\sup A \in \overline{A}$ and $\inf A \in \overline{A}$. Proof. By hypothesis, $A$ satisfies the least upper bound property (and the greatest lower bound property). So $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ exist. Now we know that $$\overline{A} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a_n \to x \ \text{for some sequence} \ (a_n) \ \text{in} \ A \}$$ Moreover, $x \in \overline{A} \Longleftrightarrow (\forall \epsilon >0) \ \exists a \in A \ni |x-a| < \epsilon$. If $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ are in $A$, then we are done. So suppose they are not. Let $x_1 = \sup A$ and $x_2 = \inf A$. By definition, for every $\epsilon >0$, there exists $x_A \in A$ such that $x_A \leq x_2 +\epsilon$. Likewise, there exists $x_B \in A$ such that $x_1- \epsilon \leq x_B$. So we get $$x_A-x_2 \leq \epsilon$$ and $$x_1-x_B \leq \epsilon$$ It seems like we would be done if we put absolute value signs on those quantities. Because then we can approximate the supremum and infimum as closely as we like with members of $A$. How would I get the absolute value signs on the above two quantities?",['real-analysis']

47920,Approximation by a $G_{\delta}$ set in Outer Measure implies Measurability,"Question: If $E\subseteq {\mathbb R}$ and if there is some $G_{\delta}$ set $G$ such that $E\subseteq G$ and $m^{\ast}(G - E) = 0$ (where this is the outer measure that is used to define the Lebesgue measure), then $E$ is (Lebesgue) measurable. Motivation: This is part of a question in Royden's book (page 64) which probably should be obvious to me.  The way that I wanted to do this question was to use the equivalence that if, given $\epsilon > 0$, there is some open set $U\supseteq E$ such that $m^{\ast}(U-E) < \epsilon$ then $E$ is measurable. Since a $G_{\delta}$ set is not necessarily open, but made up of a countable intersection of open sets, I wanted to make it the limit of some open sets.  So, if $U_{i}$ are open, I wanted to say that $G = \bigcap_{i}U_{i}$, and we can find an open set that we need just by taking some finite intersection (say, up to $N$) of the $U_{i}$.  I'm not entirely convinced that I'm given these $U_{i}$, though, if I just know that $G$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set. ( Also, I think this question is different from the other few asking about related issues, but if it is not, then I will delete it.)","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"
47930,Proving Minkowski's inequality with homogenization,"The standard proof of Minkowski's inequality in $L^p$ space using Hölder's inequality seems to be pretty unmotivated (see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%27s_inequality ). Breaking up that factor into two parts, and applying Hölder's to each of them separately makes no geometrical intuitive sense to me. Rather, it would appear that the following proof (which I came up with, though is highly probable isn't in fact mine), appears much more motivated: We need to show that $(\int_{X} |f+g|^p d\mu)^{\frac{1}{p}} \le (\int_{X} |f|^p d\mu)^{\frac{1}{p}} +(\int_{X} |g|^p d\mu)^{\frac{1}{p}}$. Let $A=(\int_{X} |f|^p d\mu)^{\frac{1}{p}}$, and $B=(\int_{X} |g|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}} d\mu$. Then setting $f_1=\frac{f}{A}$, and $g_1=\frac{g}{B}$, we get the equivalent inequalities $\int_{X} (Af_1+Bg_1)^p d\mu \le (A+B)^p$ $\int_{X} (\frac{Af_1+Bg_1}{A+B})^p d\mu \le 1$ $\int_{X} (\frac{Af_1+Bg_1}{A+B})^p d\mu \le \int_{X} \frac{A|f_1|^p+B|g_1|^p}{A+B} d\mu$ Which follows immediately from the convexity of $x^p$. Now, there are a few reasons that I find this more appealing. First, each of the steps is motivated. The first step is an attempt at homogenization, then after rewriting it in the form with the R.H.S.=1, it becomes very apparent how to finish it off using the convexity of $x^p$. Second, a similar line of reasoning is used to prove Hölder's inequality, and is used in the following quite elegant proof of Cauchy-Schwarz for finite sequences: To prove $(\sum a_i^2)(\sum b_i^2) \ge (\sum a_ib_i)^2$, we first homogenize by setting $\sum a_i^2=\sum b_i^2=1$. Then after square rooting, we see it is equivalent to the inequality $\frac{\sum a_i^2 + \sum b_i^2}{2} \ge \sum a_ib_i$, which is a direct result of AM-GM. Note that the use of homogenization is specifically used so that we can replace the L.H.S. with something much stronger while keeping the R.H.S. the same, almost as if by magic (which was essentially what my proof amounted to). Third, the equality case almost becomes trivial to see, since only one inequality was applied in the entire process, and that was at the very end of the proof. Further, it's very easy to see geometrically the idea of convexity being used here, so the equality case also seems natural. My first question is, whether there are merits to the standard proof involving Holder's inequality that I seem to be missing which either make it more general, or make it of more interest than the proof I presented. My second question is to whether the briefly summarized proof involving dual spaces presented on the same Wikipedia page is in actuality more general than my proof. That is, whether there are spaces to which we simply cannot appeal to a convexity argument, and instead have to resort to the supremum proof. Or whether my proof can somehow be modified to prove the result in a more general class of spaces which encompasses all of those which the supremum argument works for.

(b) Prove that $$R(N) = \displaystyle\sum_{d\geq 1}\left\lfloor\frac{N}{d}\right\rfloor^2 \mu(d)$$ $m\perp n$ means $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime $\mu$ is the Möbius function $\Phi(x)=\sum_{1\leq k\leq x}\phi(k)$ $\phi$ is the totient function For question (a), my solution is $R(N) = 2 \cdot \Phi(N-1) + [N>1]$ (where $[\;\;]$ is the Iverson bracket , i.e. [True]=1, [False]=0) Clearly $R(1)$ has to be zero, because the only possibility of $(m,n)$ for testing is $(0,0)$, which doesn't qualify. This agrees with my answer. But here is the book's answer: Either $m<n$ ($\Phi(N−1)$ cases) or $m=n$ (one case) or $m>n$ ($\Phi(N−1)$ again). Hence $R(N) = 2\Phi(N−1) + 1$. $m=n$ is only counted when $m=n=1$, but how could that case appear when $N=1$? I thought the book assumed $R$ is only defined over $N≥2$. But their answer for question (b) relies on $R(N) = 2Φ(N−1) + 1$ and proves the proposition also for the case $N=1$. They actually prove $2Φ(N−1) + 1 = RHS$ for $N≥1$. And if my assumption about the $R(1)$ case is true, then the proposition in (b) cannot be valid for $N=1$, for $LHS=0$ and $RHS=1$. But the fact that it's invalid just for one value seems a little fishy to me. My question is, where am I confused? What is wrong in my understanding about the case $R(1)$?

The next one threw me for a loop... Take the top card away from the deck. What is the probability of drawing an ace? And the answer was the same as the first one! I can't remember how my professor explained it, but I feel the intuition at least. All one card removals are equally likely: it's almost like still having the original 52 cards.

48119,Criteria for swapping integration and summation order,"I have a function (a potential from an electrostatic potential via a Fourier series) in the form of $$V(x, y, z)=\sum_n\sum_m \ a(x, n, m) b(y, n) c(z, m) \int\int f(u, v) d(u,n) e(v,m) 
du\, dv$$ Here functions $a(), b(), c(), d(), e()$ are known, well behaved (mostly Fourier terms, so smooth sines or expoentials).  $f()$ is unknown. I can certainly safely move all of the terms into the integral: $$V(x, y, z)=\sum_n\sum_m \ \int\int a(x, n, m) b(y, n) c(z, m)  f(u, v) d(u,n) e(v,m) 
du\, dv$$ This form is not yet useful to me. I want to switch it around to be in the form 
$$V(x, y, z) = \int\int f(u, v) w(u,v) du\, dv $$  where all the summations get combined into a weight function $w(u, v)$ with all the summation nastiness hidden inside. (My final goal is to evaluate this weight function numerically.) I'm sure this is possible... it's a method that's used to compute Greens functions in various applications. But in my derivation steps, I get to the step where the summation and integration $\sum\sum\int\int$ must be swapped to $\int\int\sum\sum$ and I can't figure out when this is ""legal"" and when it isn't.
It's a trick that many derivations simply seem to leave as given: they just say ""we swap the order"" in papers like this and lectures like this. Or I find dense theory (not practice) about convergence in complex poles with finite cuts and bruises, Fubini the Great's magic trick, superMeasuringTape theory, yadda yadda, including here. So I understand there's a wealth of fancy theoretical math on this question, and I understand that some lazy physicists just swap the order and don't even try to justify it. I am hoping someone can give me some intermediate balance between these extremes, something which says when the swap is justified and when it's not, assuming really smooth, constantly differentiable, terms like I have in my first equation above. Is the swap always safe for my example above, for any smooth functions $a() b() c() d()$ and $e()$?

My problem with this question is that it doesn't feel right. If $R$ and $S$ are rings then $R \times S$ is also so. (The addition and multiplication on $R \times S$ is defined as $(r_1,s_1)+(r_2,s_2)=(r_1+r_2,s_1+s_2)$ and $(r_1,s_1)(r_2,s_2)=(r_1r_2,s_1s_2)$ respectively where $(r_1,s_1),(r_2,s_2) \in R \times S$.) So proving that $R \times S$ is a field reduces to proving commutativity of multiplication, existence of multiplicative indentity and existence of multiplicative inverse for each element of it. Now, if the two rings are fields themselves then multiplication is commutative, the identy is $(1_R,1_S)$ and inverse of an element $(r,s)$ is $(r^{-1},s^{-1})$. So $R \times S$ is also a field.

48419,Hensel's Lemma and Implicit Function Theorem,"In the literature and on the web happened to me several times to read confused or simply cryptic assertions regarding the fact that Hensel's Lemma is the algebraic version of Implicit Function Theorem. I tried to explicit this relation but I failed, here there are some observations I made. A first good property of Henselian rings, so rings that satisfy Hensel's Lemma, is that their spectrum is homotopically equivalent to their closed point in the sense of Grothendieck. Precisely, if $\widehat{\pi}$ is the pro-fundamental group of a scheme as in SGA1, then $\widehat{\pi}(\operatorname{Spec}(A)) \simeq \widehat{\pi}(\operatorname{Spec}(k(m))$ , where $A$ is an Henselian ring and $k(m)$ is the residue field of the maximal ideal $m$ of $A$ . So I thought that spectra of Henselian rings were the kind of ""small neighborhoods"" in which you can write a ""function"" explicitly, thanks to Hensel's Lemma. But I'm confused in trying to understand what kind of functions I have to examine. Another observation is that Henselianity is exactly the condition needed for a local ring $R$ for having no non-trivial étale coverings of $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ which are trivial on the closed point. Since these coverings are in correspondence with ètale algebras of $R$ I examined this direction and I found that, for any field $k$ , the $k$ -algebra of the form $k[x]/f(x)$ is ètale over $k$ if and only if $f'(x)$ is invertible in the algebra. There is also a more complicated criterion for ètale algebras over rings which uses the invertibility of the determinant of the Jacobian of a system of polynomials. This is very reminiscent of the key condition of the Implicit Function Theorem, but I don't know why. Here I put the link for the wikipedia pages of some related concepts, such as the implicit function theorem , Henselian rings and Hensel's lemma . Moreover here you can find an article with a large introduction about Henselian rings. Thank you in advance for your time.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

Is there always a similar correspondence between a pair of polyhedra where the edges of one correspond to the faces of the other, and if so does that relationship have a name? (I'm calling it the edge-face dual of a polyhedron for now.) Additionally, does this relationship exist between the cube and the rhombic dodecahedron? It's my best guess: cubes have 12 edges and all dodecahedra have 12 faces, and the rhombic dodecahedron is face-transitive and tessellates $\mathbb{R}^3$. If this is the case, then the edge-face dual relationship that I'm looking for is obviously not symmetric, since dodecahedra have 24 edges while cubes only have 6 faces. Here's some background for what I'm looking for: One way to extend a hexagonal tiling of $\mathbb{R}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ is to extrude the hexagon along the new dimension, producing a tessellation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into hexagonal prisms. I'm looking for a different tiling—one that is related to the isometric projection of a cube , using the observation that a cube is projected into a hexagon. The six adjacent hexagons are connected by six of the cube's projected edges. If you consider the cubes as also tessellating $\mathbb{R}^3$, this leaves six more edges; three ""above"" and three ""below."" There are six more cells connected symmetrically to this one. It's not terribly difficult to picture this as being an 3D analogue to a hexagonal grid. The trouble is, I find it awkward that every connection is between edges, not between faces, and also that each edge touches four other cells, but I'm only considering one to be ""adjacent."" I find the tiling I get from the above scheme to be desirable; if you're looking at a plane of cells such that you see a hexagonal grid, each cell has six neighbors in that plane, as well as three above (centered on the cell's center) and three below (also centered). I'm trying to find a polyhedron that tessellates $\mathbb{R}^3$ that ""looks like"" a hexagon in a 2D plane, but where I can consider the adjacent cells to be polyhedra that share faces, and where each plane ""stacked"" on top of each other is regularly translated (in the same manner as the above scheme). I can't quite tell if a rhombic dodecahedron is what I want, and if the above description is at all rigorous.

Do you know a better approach for getting a tight bound on that sum? Of course I could always use some numerical optimization, but then you have to trouble yourself with bracketing the minimum and maximum, which I would rather like to avoid. I would much prefer a clean geometric or analytical solution. Thanks for your thoughts. P.S.: I am having quite some trouble tagging this question to the right field, as it seems so elementary. You are welcome to set better tags than I did... Edit 1 Two thoughts: You can show that it is either $P_i=Q_i$ or $||P_i-Q_i||=\epsilon$ when minimizing or maximizing the sum of squares You can write the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. However, this seems so much trouble for such a small problem...","['optimization', 'geometry', 'inequality']"
48638,Is a union of varieties singular in the intersection of its irreducible components?,"Consider a separated, reduced scheme $X$ of finite type over some algebraically closed field $\Bbbk$. Let $X=X_1\cup\cdots X_r$  be its irreducible components, each of which is then a variety. Assume that $P\in X_i \cap X_j$  for $i\ne j$. I then wonder when $X$ is singular in $P$ - is this always the case or do I need some additional assumption? Also, can I weaken the assumptions on $X$?",['algebraic-geometry']

48682,Maximization with xor operator,"With given N numbers only one of those numbers doesn't have pair, which one is it? After hours of surfing the net i found that XOR operator is good for that, because X xor X=0
X xor 0=X and A xor B xor C = B xor A xor C so we can do xor in any order.
But yesterday i've found next nice problem.
With given N numbers i have to pick subset of them which XOR is as maximum as possible.
I've figured out that if we want to have maximum result we need to xor numbers with totally different(or at least similiar) binary representation, but i think it's too slow approach.
How to deal with this one?

48686,"Holomorphic mappings, Plücker's formula (Mistake in Rick Miranda's book?)","In Rick Miranda's book ""Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces"", in order to prove Plücker's formula for smooth projective plane curves, he first defines a projective plane curve by the formula $X:F(x,y,z)=0$, where of course $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial. Now, he defines the map $\pi:X\to\mathbb{P}^2$ such that $[x:y:z]\mapsto[x:z]$, and uses properties of this map to prove the formula. This may be a really dumb question with an obvious answer, but is this function $\pi$ really defined on all the curve $X$? What if $F(x,y,z)=x+z$; then $\pi[0:1:0]$ wouldn't be defined. The proof in the book uses the ramification divisor of $\pi$, and so necessarily makes use of the fact that $\pi$ is well defined. If anyone can clarify this problem for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!","['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"
48689,A balanced latin rectangle (more rows than columns),"In psychology we sometimes use balanced latin squares for the order of our tests to counterbalance first-order carry-over effects (fatigue, learning, etc.) . For our current study we want to pretest 12 stimuli (let's call them A-F) to see whether they're useful for a later study. We don't want to bore our participants, so we wanted to give them only half of all the material we need to test. We're indifferent about the size of the subset of 12 as long as it is anything between 4-8 stimuli per participant. For a different reason (to achieve sufficient statistical power) we need at least 132 participants (at least 11 runs where each stimulus occurs first), we don't want to exceed this too heavily. A balanced latin square 6*6 isn't too hard to construct . There is a Matlab script as well. A   B   F   C   E   D
B   C   A   D   F   E
C   D   B   E   A   F
D   E   C   F   B   A
E   F   D   A   C   B
F   A   E   B   D   C But is it also possible to construct a balanced ( latin ) rectangle (6 columns wide), where each letter is followed by another letter an equal amount of times? How many rows (participants) would this yield? Maybe somebody with a bit more handle on this problem will enjoy the puzzle! Sorry if my language is too idiosyncratic, if I can clarify with the appropriate jargon I'll duly comply, this is quite outside my field. Splitting it in the middle and then adding the broken-up orders seemed the wrong approach to me. Edit: Can I find one computationally? I have no idea how ridiculous that question is, but the sheer number of permutations (479 001 600) does seem daunting. Edit 2: I didn't want to make this question too much about our experiment, but apparently that made it less clear. I'm sorry. I edited the clarifications into the question.","['latin-square', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"
