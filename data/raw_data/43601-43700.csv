433283,Better Proofs Than Rudin's For The Inverse And Implicit Function Theorems,"I am finding Rudin's proofs of these theorems very non-intuitive and difficult to recall. I can understand and follow both as I work through them, but if you were to ask me a week later to prove one or the other, I couldn't do it. For instance, the use of a contraction mapping in the inverse function theorem seems to require one to memorize, at the very least, a non-obvious (at least to me) function (viz. $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{A}^{-1}(\mathbf{y}-\operatorname{f}(\mathbf{x}))$) and constant (viz. $\lambda^{-1} = 2 \Vert \mathbf{A}^{-1}\Vert$), where $\mathbf{A}$ is the differential of $\operatorname{f}$ at $\mathbf{a}$. The implicit function theorem proof, while not as bad, also requires one to construct a new function without ever hinting as to what the motivation is. I searched the previous questions on this site and haven't found this addressed, so I figured I'd ask. I did finnd this proof to have a much more intuitive approach to the inverse function theorem, but would like to see what proofs are preferred by others.","['reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
433293,Prove that $\lfloor\lfloor x/2 \rfloor / 2 \rfloor = \lfloor x/4 \rfloor$,"In class, we briefly covered what ""floor"" and ""ceiling"" mean.  Very simple concepts.  They were on one slide, and then we never heard about them again.  But now the following homework problem has popped up: $$\lfloor\lfloor x/2 \rfloor / 2 \rfloor = \lfloor x/4 \rfloor$$ Usually when I post a problem (especially from homework), I like to demonstrate that I'm not just asking for the answer by showing what I've done, what I know so far, and so on... but in this case, I have absolutely no idea where to even begin. I will say that my first approach was to create a chart and try various values for ""x"" in order to see if there's a pattern and to make sure there was no easy counter-example to prove it false.  That was all fine and well, but ultimately I couldn't figure out what to do with the results. Googling for this is quite difficult, as everyone uses slightly different notation and therefore one search doesn't encompass all the actual results.  The only clue that I've seen so far that kind of sort of makes sense, was when some guy said that ""x"" should be replaced with ""4n + k"", since the right-hand side of the equation is divided by 4, so that k is any remainder 0 through 3. How should one approach this problem?  What kind of manipulations can you do to floors?  What can you assume?  etc. etc. ...","['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
433305,Is $\binom{52}{n}\cdot\binom{52-n}{n}$ maximised by $n=\frac{52}{3}$? If so why?,"I've been thinking a lot about cards, and recently about the combination of combination of hands....if you drew $n$ cards from a deck of $52$, and then drew another $n$ cards, how many combinations are there? The number of combinations appears to peak at about $1\times10^{23}$ so I threw in my best guess at the peak number, 17, I realised that it would have to be the midpoint between the maximal of $\binom{52}{n}$ and $\binom{52-n}{n}$, which is going to be $\frac{26+13}{2}=17\frac13$ or $\frac{52}{3}$. Putting that in gives me $1.01446\times10^{23}$! But all of this is from intuition, and I have no reason to believe this holds on all cases, nor do I know of the general case. Is that number the maximising number? If so why, and is there a general case? My guess at a general solution would be something like:
$$\prod_{i=0}^n\binom{m-i\cdot n}{n}\text{is maximised by }\begin{cases}\frac{m}{T_n(i+1)+1} & \text{if } i=0\\ \frac{m}{T_n(i)+1} & \text{if } i>0\end{cases}$$ But I've not formal Mathematics knowledge (just University level physics) so I'm not certain.

433360,Counterexample for the stability of orthogonal projections,"Let $V$ be a seperable Banach space, which is dense and continuously embedded in a Hilbert Space $H$. Let $(V_m)$ be a Galerkin scheme (See definition below) for $V$. Using the embedding we can regard the $(V_m)$ as subspaces of $H$. Then let $(P_m)$ be the orthogonal projections onto $(V_m)$. Using the embedding again, we can regard those as Operators in $V$. For certain choices of $V, H, (V_m)$ one can prove, that the series of orthogonal projections is stable in $V$. This means, that there is a constant $C$ such that
$$||P_m || = \sup_{x \in V\backslash\{0\}} \frac{||P_m(x)||}{||x||} \leq C \ .$$ Proves for certain choices of $V,H,(V_m)$ can be found for example in a Paper of M. Crouzeix and V. Thomée ($V=L_p, H=L_2$) and more recently in a Paper of E. Emmrich and D. Siska (See Remark 3.8. and Lemma 4.2). Being fairly new to this subject, I am trying to figure out, why this property should not allways hold. So my question is if anyone can think of a nice counterexample, i.e. a set $V, H, (V_m)$ for which the property is not fullfilled. Update Definition of a Galerkin scheme Let $(V, || \cdot||)$, be a Banach space. A Galerkin scheme is a series $\{V_m\}$ of finite dimensional subspaces $V_m \subset V$ that fullfills

433364,Rudin's Construction of Lebesgue Measure,"Self-studying Rudin's RCA, and I want to make sure I am understanding the intricacies of his construction of the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The uniform continuity of $f$ shows that there is an integer $N$ and
  functions $g,h$ with support in $W$ such that: (i) $g,h$ are constant
  on each box in  $\Omega_N$, (ii) $g \leq f \leq h$, (iii) $h-g <
 \epsilon$. What is the simplest way to construct such functions? My first thought was to consider $\operatorname{cl}(A)$ of a box $A \in \Omega_N$ and apply the Extreme Value Theorem to obtain a maximal and minimal value of $f(x)$. Setting $h,g$ as those maximum and minimum values for $x \in A$, respectively, then gives (i),(ii). The Uniform Continuity Lemma then gives (iii) via an appropriate choice of $N$. This however strikes me as a needlessly complicated construction; I am confident Rudin had something simpler in mind. Property 2.19c then shows that: $$\forall n > N, \quad \Lambda_N g =
 \Lambda_n g \leq \Lambda_n f \leq \Lambda_n h = \Lambda_N h$$ This seems to follow if we partition $P_n$ into the boxes $P_n \cap A$. But once again it seems that some simpler methodology would be applicable. Thus the upper and lower limits of $\{\Lambda_n f\}$ differ by at most
  $\epsilon \operatorname{vol}(W)$, and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary
  we have proved the existence of $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f = \Lambda f$$ Using the formalism described above, no natural way to establish this limit suggests itself, but this should be remedied by superior ways of establishing the above claims. More specifically, we obtain that $$\lim\limits_{\epsilon \to 0} \;(\limsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f - \liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} \Lambda_n f) = 0.$$
How precisely to we formally proceed from the above to equality of the inferior and superior limits, and therefore convergence?
Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","['complex-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral']"

433366,Origins of the Twin Prime Conjecture,"The exciting new results by Zhang and others about bounds on the gaps between pairs of primes have been getting a fair amount of press, which is great! Some of them have gotten me wondering about the origins and history of the Twin Prime Conjecture. My searches into this question have been so far been unsatisfying. Several articles claim that the conjecture can be attributed to Euclid: Some attribute the conjecture to the Greek mathematician Euclid of
  Alexandria, which would make it one of the oldest open problems in
  mathematics. (from here ) This isn't very satisfying. It's possible that this is true, but to my knowledge Euclid's extant works do not contain such a conjecture, or even conjectures at all. ( overview ) So if this is true, Euclid's claim to of the Twin Primes Conjecture must have come from later sources. Wikipedia has only the following weak statement to offer: The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has
  been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. (from here ) My many Google searches have not been successful in getting better information. Can anyone share a trustworthy reference about when the Twin Prime Conjecture was first stated? Bonus points if it gives some of the further history of this conjecture. The Wikipedia article only picks up in the early twentieth century. Thanks!","['math-history', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"
433367,Considering a sum of a monotonically increasing and decreasing sequence.,"The following is the problem that I am working on. Let $\{z_n\} = \{x_n\}+\{y_n\}$ be a sequence where $\{x_n\}$ is monotonically increasing, $\{y_n\}$ monotonically decreasing, and $\{z_n\}$ is bounded. Is $\{z_n\}$ convergent ? What if $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ are also bounded ? I can clearly see and prove that in the second case, $\{z_n\}$ must converge to the sum of each of the limits of the sequences (because they exist). However, this is what I think about the case where only $\{z_n\}$ is bounded. Intuitively I want to say that it would be nice if $\{z_n\}$ converges but that sounds too good. So I considered the following case. If $\{x_n\}$ increases ""faster"" than $\{y_n\}$ decreasing, $\{z_n\}$ will become a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded, thus it will converge to the sup of $\{z_n\}$ . If $\{y_n\}$ decreases ""faster"" then with the similar argument $\{z_n\}$ will converge to the inf. If their increasing and decreasing rate are equal then it's a constant sequence, so the limit is cogent. But I am not 100% confident that there doesn't exist a ""rate of increase and decrease that lies in between"" so that $\{z_n\}$ eventually oscillates or something. Can someone help me out ?","['limits', 'analysis']"

433635,(From Lang $SL_2$) Orthonormal bases for $L^2 (X \times Y)$,"Lang $SL_2$ p. 13 :Let $\{\phi_i\}$, $\{\psi_i\}$ be orthonormal bases for $L^2(X)$ and $L^2(Y)$ respectively. Let $$\theta_{ij}(x,y) = \phi_i(x)\psi_i(y).$$ Then $\{\theta_{ij}\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $L^2(X \times Y)$. To see this, it is first clear that the $\theta_{ij}$ are of norm 1, and mutually orthogonal. Let $g \in \mathcal L^2(X \times Y)$ be perpendicular to all $\{\theta_{ij}\}$. Then $$\int_X\phi_i(x)dx\int_Y\psi_j(y)g(x,y)dy=0(*)$$ for all $i,j$. Hence $$x \mapsto\int_Y\psi_j(y)g(x,y)dy$$ is zero except for $x$ in a null set $S$ in $X$. If $x \notin S$, then for almost all $y$, we have $g(x,y) = 0$ Questions: I assume that in ($*$) a double integral is meant, i.e. the integral over $Y$ should be inside the integral over $X$. 1) It is not clear to me how to get from ($*$) to the conclusion that the above map is zero for almost all y, and similarly from this to the fact that $g(x,y)$ is zero for almost all y. This would of course follow if the orthonormal basis were positive, which is not always the case since sines and cosines form an orthonormal basis for $L^2[0,1]$. 2) In the next page, Lang considers an orthonormal basis for $L^2(X \times X)$. He ascertains that it is {$\phi_i\otimes\bar\phi_j$}. Why do we have to take conjugate on the second element in $L^2(X \times X)$ but not in $L^2(X \times Y)$? 3) Does anyone know what is the difference between $L^2$ and $\mathcal L^2$?","['functional-analysis', 'integration', 'representation-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'orthonormal']"

433644,Is Householder orthogonalization/QR practicable for non-Euclidean inner products?,"The question Is there a variant of the Householder QR algorithm to orthonormalize a set of vectors with respect to an inner product if no orthonormal basis is known a priori? Background Let's assume that $A\in\mathbb{C}^{n,k}$ is a matrix with $\operatorname{rank}(A)=k$ . We can then compute the QR factorization $A=QR$ with $Q=[q_1,\ldots,q_k]\in\mathbb{C}^{n,k}$ and $R\in\mathbb{C}^{k,k}$ to obtain an orthonormal basis (with respect to the Euclidean inner product) $q_1,\ldots,q_k$ of $\operatorname{range}(A)$ , i.e. $q_i^*q_j = \delta_{ij}$ . If orthonormality is critical in the presence of round-off errors, the Householder QR algorithm is the method of choice (cf. Golub, Van Loan. Matrix Computations. ). Compared to the (modified) Gram-Schmidt algorithm the Householder QR algorithm benefits from the favorable round-off properties of Householder transformations. I am aware of the paper Trefethen, Householder triangularization of a quasimatrix, 2009 where the $L^2$ -inner product is used for a Householder QR algorithm. However, an orthonormal basis (the Legendre polynomials) is known in the paper by Trefethen. In my application only the Hermitian and positive definite matrix $B\in\mathbb{C}^{n,n}$ defining the inner product $\langle x,y \rangle_B = x^* B y$ is known. Because $n\gg k$ it's also infeasible to compute an eigen-decomposition of B. It seems to me that knowing one orthonormal basis (i.e. the standard basis) is crucial in the construction of the Householder QR algorithm but perhaps I'm wrong and there is a trick to let Householder QR work with arbitrary inner products?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'numerical-methods', 'numerical-linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
433659,Fibonacci-like sequence,"Today I have to deal with something which reminds Fibonacci sequence. Let's say I have a certain number k, which is n-th number of certain sequence. This sequence however is created by recursive formula that we know from Fibonacci $a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)$, where $n \ge 2$ and $a(0) \le a(1) \le \dots \le a(n)$. So let's say $a(n) = k$. Now I have to find $a(0)$, $a(1)$ that are initial number of this sequence, however the sequence should be longest possible and in case there are many of them which are of the same length $a(0)$ should be smallest possible. Some example: $k = 10$ I can simply say $a(0) = 0$, $a(1) = 10$ so $a(n) = k$ is a part of this sequence since $a(0) + a(1) = a(2) = 10$. But it's not the longest possible. For instance choose $a(0) = 0$, $a(1) = 2$, now $a(2) = 2$, $a(3) = 4$, $a(4) = 6$, $a(5) = 10$, it's also valid sequence and length is $6$ and as far as I know it cannot be longer. Any idea how to do so for any $k$? Might be math formula or some algorithm.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'algorithms']"
433660,Convergence in distribution of Gaussian processes,"Assume given a sequence $(W_n)$ of Gaussian processes indexed by, say, $\mathbb{R}^p$, with mean zero and covariance function $R_n$. This means that for each $n$, the finite-dimensional distributions of $W_n$ are multivariate Gaussian with mean zero, and for each $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^p$, $\textrm{Cov}(W_n(x),W_n(y))=R_n(x,y)$. A priori, each $W_n$ takes its values merely in the space of functions from $\mathbb{R}^p$ to $\mathbb{R}$. To ensure sufficient regularity, assume for definiteness that each $W_n$ in fact takes its values in some Banach space $B$. This could for example be the space of bounded functions, or the space of continuous functions. My question is this: What are sufficient criteria for weak convergence of the sequence $(W_n)$? A few comments: As projections onto finitely many coordinates generally are continuous, it is clear that weak convergence of $W_n$ implies convergence of finite-dimensional distributions. This also means that the candidate limit distribution is uniquely determined by the limits of the finite-dimensional distributions of $W_n$. Therefore, the candidate weak limit $W$ will have to be a Gaussian process as well, taking its values in the same Banach space $B$ as $(W_n)$. What is required for weak convergence of $W_n$ is some notion of tightness, which ideally should be expressed in the relationship between the covariance functions $R_n$ and their limit. One might ask why weak convergence instead of mere convergence of finite-dimensional distributions is interesting: My own main interest is to ensure convergence of functionals such as the supremum as well, and to obtain this, convergence of finite-dimensional distributions in general does not suffice.","['stochastic-processes', 'convergence-divergence', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

I split the proof into two cases: one where $k$ is odd and another where it is even. The case where $k$ is odd can be proven as follows: $$\sum_{i = 1}^{p - 1}i^k \equiv \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}i^k + \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}(-i)^k \pmod p$$ Since $k$ is odd each $(-i)^k = -i^k$, and will cancel with the positive $i$ leaving a zero. Therefore, $$\sum_{i = 1}^{p - 1}i^k \equiv 0 \pmod p \text{ if $k$ is odd.} $$ I approached the case where $k$ is even in a similar fashion. $$\sum_{i = 1}^{p - 1}i^k \equiv \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}i^k + \sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}(-i)^k \equiv 2(\sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}i^k) \space \pmod p$$ Since $p$ is prime, we just need to prove that $\displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}i^k \equiv 0 \pmod p$. I was stumped after this, so I considered a counterexample, one where $k$ is divisible by $p - 1$. In that I considered a case where $p = 5, k = 8$: $$1^8 + 2^8 + 3^8 + 4^8 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \space \pmod p$$ This and a few other cases led to the conjecture that all the numbers below $p$ have a mod cycle $(mod \space p)$ that is divisible by $p - 1$.

So - the ""opposite""of the tip of my left shoulder is the tip of my right shoulder at the same height, etc.). Maybe we can just assume I'm a cylinder for simplicity (?). Let's definitely assume the sun is at an ""infinite distance"" (i.e. the rays are parallel over the entire region where I'm running). First of all, is my conjecture true? Second of all, how would we approach trying to prove it if it's true? My intuition tells me something related to the standard integral theorems of vector calculus might be a way to go: Stokes' theorem, etc. For simplicity, we can start by assuming a simple closed path that doesn't cross itself ...

Are there similarly nice & useful categorical characterizations of the other separation axioms? There is also one for Tichonov spaces - these are completely regular $T_1$ spaces (in fact it always turns out that they are $T_2$).
