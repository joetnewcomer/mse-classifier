445363,How is the norm on $C^k(M)$ defined?,"Let $M$ be a smooth, compact $n$-dimensional manifold and $C^k(M)$ the space of real valued $C^k$-maps on $M$. I am looking for a definition of the norm $|\cdot|_k$ on $C^k(M)$ that induces the Whitney-topology. My suggestion for a possible definition is: Fix a Riemannian metric on $M$ and a finite open cover $\{U_j\}_{j=1}^N$ of $M$ such that $\forall 1\leq j\leq N$ there exists a family $\{v_1^j,\ldots,v_n^j\}$ of orthonormal vector fields on $U_j$.
For each $j$ also fix such a family of vector fields.
Given $f\in C^k(M)$ define
$$
|f|_k:=\sup_{j}\sup_{x\in U_j}\sup_{\alpha:|\alpha|\leq k} |D^\alpha f(x)|
$$
where $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$ is a multiindex,
$$
D^\alpha f:=\underbrace{D_{v_1^j}\cdots D_{v_1^j}}_{\alpha_1}\cdots \underbrace{D_{v_n^j}\cdots D_{v_n^j}}_{\alpha_n}f
$$
and $D_vf:=(df)(v)$.
If $\alpha=(0,\ldots,0)$, then $D^\alpha f:=f$. Is this a sensible definition of the norm $|\cdot|_k$? Also, I'm not sure if different choices of Riemannian metrics, covers of $M$ and vector fields give equivalent norms. References are greatly appreciated.

445367,Sufficiently many idempotents and commutativity,"It is a well-known result that if a ring $R$ satisfies $a^2=a$ for each $a\in R$, then $R$ must be commutative. See here for proof. I am wondering whether the same result holds for finite rings if we only assume sufficiently many (but not necessarily all) elements of the ring are idempotents. Recall that an element $a\in R$ is called idempotent if $a^2=a$. For example, suppose $R$ is a finite ring in which at least $80$% elements are idempotents. Can we conclude that $R$ is commutative? More generally, Does there exist an absolute constant $0<k<1$, such that whenever a finite ring $R$ satisfies
  $$\frac{\textrm{Number of idempotents}}{|R|}\ge k$$ then $R$ is
  commutative. Motivation: We know that if every element of a group $G$ satisfies $a^2=1$, then $G$ must be abelian. This is a relatively easy exercise. However, it turns out that we only need 75% percent of elements to satisfy $a^2=1$ in order force $G$ to be abelian. See here. For reference, $a\in G$ is called involution if $a^2=1$.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'idempotents']"
445382,Minimizing set intersection/block design,"I asked this question on the CS theory stack exchange, but didn't get an answer. Was wondering whether anyone here might have some insight. Thanks in advance for any help. Given 3 parameters $s, r$ and $t$, where $r \leq t$, I want to construct $t$ sets such that each integer $\{1, \ldots, s\}$ appears in exactly $r$ of these sets. The question is: Is it possible to construct $t$ sets such that the size of the maximum pairwise intersection between any two $t_i, t_j$ is $\leq k$? What is the complexity of this decision problem? Is minimizing the maximum pairwise intersection between the sets $\mathsf{NP}$-hard? A comment on the CS Theory stackexchange pointed out that this probably is not NP-complete, since verifying the intersection of all of the sets is quadratic in t and therefore exponential in the size of the input. There is a lower bound on the max pairwise intersection given by ceiling(number of identical value pairs / number of set pairs), $\lceil (s \cdot {r \choose 2}) / {t \choose 2} \rceil$. This is a natural value for $k$ above, making the question whether there exists an assignment that achieves this bound. The problem seems related to, but slightly different from, the block design problem . In the block design problem, there is a parameter $\lambda$ that dictates in how many of the $t$ sets each pair of integers in $\{1, \ldots, s\}$ must appear, so if $\lambda$ is 1, the maximum pairwise intersection between sets is 1 (since each pair of values appears in at most 1 set together). I've seen claims that deciding the existence of a block design is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, but no actual proof - would also appreciate any link to such a proof.","['computer-science', 'combinatorics']"
445392,Does This Condition Characterize $e^z$?,"The following is a question from a Complex Analysis qualifying exam I was studying from: Does there exist an entire function $f$, distinct from $e^z$, such that $f(0)=1$ and $f'(n)=f(n)$ for all $n\geq 1$? My instinct is that such a function should exist, although I have tried cooking one up and I have been unable to do so. I then decided my instinct may have been incorrect, so I tried proving $e^z$ is the only such function, but I have been unable to do so. The roadblock to one potential method: A common way to show two analytic functions are the same is showing they agree on a set in their domains with a limit point. If I could show any function $f$ and $e^z$ agreed on the positive integers, then they would agree with $\infty$ as the limit point (under the transformation $z\mapsto 1/z$, this is the same as saying the limit point is zero) but $e^z$ is not a function on $\mathbb{C}_{\infty}$ (i.e., $e^{1/z}$ has an essential singularity at $z=0$).

445405,"Finding indefinite integral $\int\frac{\sqrt{a+x}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{x}}\, dx$","$$\int\frac{\sqrt{a+x}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{x}}\, dx$$ A few days ago I asked a similar (looking) question where all the pluses here were minuses.
It could be much more easily manipulated than this one using difference of $2$ squares. The other method used to solve the previous problem is replacing $x$ with $\arccos^2x$. Out of curiosity I have attempted to use the latter method to solve this integral, and made a little progress with it. Just to make sure this integral has a solution, Wolframalpha found a solution that was not too bad. Replacing $x$ with $\arctan^2t$, the integral becomes $$\int\frac{2a \sec^3 t \tan t}{1+\tan t}\, dt$$ From here I tried to perfrom integration by parts, where $2a$ is taken outside of the integral, and numberator split into $sec x\tan x$ times $\sec^2x$, as $u$ and $v'$ respectively. $v$ can easily be found but $u'$ is messy. Integration by parts needed to be done again, also, which would have ended up really messy. So I tried to convert everything into sines and cosines, then letting $u$ equal $\cos t$, and $du$ equal to $-\sin tdt$. $$\int\frac{2a\sin t}{\cos^3 t \cos t +\sin t}\, dt$$ $$\int\frac{-2au}{u^3 u+\sqrt{1-u^2}}\, dt$$ However that doesn't look very pretty either. I don't think it is possible to perform Partial Fraction Decomposition on it. What are the right paths to take to solve this integral? Are there any 'tricks of the trade' I have missed along the way?","['integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"

445420,Find a basis for the range and kernel of $T$.,"Find a basis for the range and kernel of $T$. $$A =\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 & -1\\
4 & 0 &  -2\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}  $$ Attempt at Solving for Basis of Range: On finding the basis for the range, I know that the range is the same thing as the column space. So, finding the basis of the column space should be equivalent to finding the basis of the range. I got the following after reducing: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -\frac 12\\
0 & 0 &  0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} $$ Because I only have a pivot in column $1$, my corresponding column in the original $A$ (thus my basis for the range), would be: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix}
2\\
4\\
0
\end{bmatrix} $$ The solution given in the text says that this should actually be: $$\mathrm{Rref}(A) =\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
2\\
0
\end{bmatrix}$$ I can see that the book solution only differs from mine in that their solution seems to have been divided by $2$. However, my question is - why are they dividing by 2? I don't understand why the original column is being altered. Attempt at Solving for Basis of Kernel: In solving for the kernel, I know that the basis of the kernel should be the same as the basis for the nullspace.  From the $\mathrm{Rref}(A)$ above, I got the following equation:
$(X_1) = (\frac12X_3)$. Letting $X_3$ equal one, I got the following matrix for the basis of the kernel: $$\text{Basis of Kernel} =\begin{bmatrix}
\frac12\\
0\\
1
\end{bmatrix}$$ This answer checks out with my solution in the text, but the text also provides the following solution:
 =\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
1\\
0
\end{bmatrix} I'm guessing this comes from the zero row in my $\mathrm{Rref}(A)$. But, why is this done? I thought the number of bases came from the number of independent variables in the $\mathrm{Rref}(A)$...",['linear-algebra']
445429,Prime with a given digit sum,"Suppose $n>1$ is not divisible by 3. Is there a prime such that the sum of its decimal digits is equal to $n$? More generally, given a base $b\ge2$ and $n>1$ coprime to $b-1$, is there a prime such that the sum of its base-$b$ digits is equal to $n$? At first glance this seems like an obviously true but hopeless to prove statements. But work in the last decade by such authors as Drmota, Martin, Mauduit, Rivat, and Sárközy** makes it seem plausible that the result is known. Trivial results: $n=2$ works, choosing 2 in any base. $n=3$ works choosing 3 in bases above 3 and 7 otherwise. The smallest nonobvious case is $n=4$ which I have checked in even bases up to $10^6.$ Larger numbers should only get easier in terms of degrees of freedom. Perhaps the problem is more obvious than it seems, any ideas? ** Note: There's always a risk of leaving someone off a list of authors.

445487,"Prove that at a party with at least two people, there are two people who know the same number of people.","Okay, now, I really want to solve this on my own, and I believe I have the basic idea, I'm just not sure how to put it as an answer on the homework.  The problem in full: ""Prove that at a party with at least two people, that there are two
  people who know the same number of people there (not necessarily the
  same people - just the same number) given that every person at the
  party knows at least one person.  Also, note that nobody can be his or
  her own friend.  You can solve this with a tricky use of the
  Pigeonhole Principle."" First of all, I'm treating the concept of ""knowing"" as A can know B, but B doesn't necessary know A.  e.g. If Tom Cruise walks into a party, I ""know"" him, but he doesn't know me. So what I did first was proved it to myself using examples of a party with 2 people, 3 people, 4 people, and so on.  Indeed, under any condition, there is always at least a pair of people who know the same number of people. So if we define $n$ as the number of party goers, then we can see that this is true under any circumstance if we assume that the first person knows the maximum number of people possible, which is $(n-1)$ (as a person can't be friends with himself).  Then since we're not interested in a case where the second person knows the same number of people (otherwise there's nothing to prove), we want the second person to know one less than than the first, or $(n-2)$, and so on. Eventually we reach a contradiction where the last person knows $(n-n)$, or 0.  Since 0 is not a possible value as defined by the problem, that last person must know any number of people from 1 to $(n-1)$, which equals the number of people that at least one other person knows. Now...I hope that this is the ""right idea."" But how can I turn this ""general understanding"" into an answer for a problem that begins with the word ""prove?"" Let me note that we only very briefly touched on the concepts of induction and the pigeonhole principle, and did not go into any examples of how to formally ""prove"" anything with the pigeonhole principle.  We did touch on proving the sum of numbers by induction, but that's all as far as induction goes. Also: Combinatorics question: Prove 2 people at a party know the same amount of people does not really work for me, because A) we've not talked about ""combinatorics"", and B) that question allows for someone to know 0 people.","['logic', 'induction', 'pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

What are the major laws that apply here? To get the ball rolling, here's 5 that I know of. Notation . Let $\Omega$ denote a set. Define $A^c = \Omega \setminus A$ for all $A \subseteq \Omega.$ Suppose furthermore that $X$ and $Y$ are functions $I,J \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega),$ where $I$ and $J$ are just some arbitrary index sets. We will use the $X_i$ in preference to $X(i)$. Lastly, define that the empty intersection equals $\Omega.$ That is, $$\bigcap_{i \in \emptyset} X_i = \Omega.$$ Then we have the following. If $\mathrm{ran}(X) \subseteq \mathrm{ran}(Y)$, then
$$\bigcup_{i \in I}X_i \subseteq \bigcup_{j \in J}Y_j, \quad \bigcap_{i \in I}X_i \supseteq \bigcap_{j \in J}Y_j$$ (Corollary). If $\mathrm{ran}(X) = \mathrm{ran}(Y),$ then

Then Zassenhaus extended this theorem excluding assumption that $N$ is abelian. In the book ""The Theory of Groups"" by Zassenhaus, the extended theorem appears only with name of Schur. The questions I would like to ask are historical, and I am posting here, since I couldn't find much about this theorem, anywhere. Q.1. Give the name of the paper where Schur proved (t)his theorem first. Q.2. Has Zassenhaus published the extended theorem before including in his book? Zassenhaus gives the proof of the extended theorem in his book (p.162 in Dover Edition, and p.~132 in AMS Chelsea Edition). After the proof, he says, "" It has been conjectured that any two complements of $N$ are conjugate in $G$ ..."" Zassenhaus gives the proof of the conjuncture (in his book) in the following cases: i) $N$ is abelian; ii) $N$ is solvable; iii)$G/N$ is solvable.

445735,Compactly supported continuous function is uniformly continuous,"Let $f:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be continuous and compactly supported. How can I prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous ? I was trying to prove it by contradiction but get stuck. My attempt was as follows: Let $E$ be the compact support of $f$ . On $E$ we know that $f$ is uniformly continuous. If we assume that $f$ is not uniformly continuous we know $$
\exists \epsilon > 0 \forall \delta > 0 \exists x,y \in \mathbb R: |x-y|<\delta \wedge |f(x)-f(y)| \geq \epsilon
$$ Let $\delta_n := \frac 1n$ and fix this $\epsilon > 0$ . Compute a $\delta > 0$ s.t. $\forall x,y \in E:|x-y| < \delta \rightarrow |f(x)-f(y)| <\epsilon$ . Let $n \geq N$ s.t. $\frac 1N < \delta$ . Then we may assume wlog that $x_n \in E$ and $y_n \in \mathbb R \setminus E$ wehere $x_n,y_n$ are the points corresponding with $\delta_n$ . This gives a sequence of points where $|x_n-y_n| \rightarrow 0$ and $x_n \in E$ and $y_n \in \mathbb R \setminus E$ . I now want to use somehow the continuitiy of $f$ . How can I do this ? Is this approach a good one ? Can it be more simple ? New idea:
I know that $E$ is compact so $(y_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ has a convergent subsequence $(y_{n_j})_{j=0}^\infty$ whit limit say $y \in E$ . Now $$
 |x_{n_j}-y| \leq |x_{n_j}-y_{n_j}|+|y_{n_j}+y| \rightarrow 0
$$ So I can take $x_{n_j}$ close to $y$ to get $|f(x_{n_j})-f(y)| = |f(y)| <\frac \epsilon 2$ by the continuity. I can also take $y_{n_j}$ close to $y$ to get $|f(y_{n_j})-f(y)| <\frac \epsilon 2$ . We further have $$
 |f(y_{n_j})| \leq |f(y_{n_j})-f(y)| + |f(y)|
$$ s.t. $$
  |f(y)| \geq |f(y_{n_j})| - |f(y_{n_j})-f(y)| \geq \frac \epsilon 2
$$ because $|f(y_{n_j})| \geq \epsilon$ per construction. So we have $|f(y)| \leq \frac \epsilon 2$ and $|f(y)| > \frac \epsilon 2$ which is a contradiction. New solution: Let $\epsilon > 0$ . Let $\delta_1$ for the uniform continuity on $E$ . Further $$
 \forall x \in E,\ \exists \delta_x > 0\ \forall y \in \mathbb{R}: |x-y|< \delta_x \rightarrow |f(x)-f(y)| < \epsilon
$$ Compute an open finite over of $E$ $$
 E \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^N B\left(x_i,\frac{\delta_{x_i}}2\right)
$$ Write $\delta_i := \delta_{x_i}$ . Let $\delta_2 := \min_{i=1,\cdots,N} \frac {\delta_i} 2$ and $\delta := \min(\delta_1,\delta_2)$ . Assume $|x-y|< \delta$ . If $x,y \in E$ or $x,y \notin E$ we are done. Otherwise assume $x \in E$ and $y \notin E$ . Then $x \in B\left(x_i,\frac{\delta_i}{2}\right)$ for some $i$ . Further $$
 |y-x_i| \leq |y-x|+|x-x_i|\leq \delta_2 + \frac{\delta_i}2 \leq \delta_i
$$ thus $y \in B(x_i,\delta_i)$ which proves the claim.","['uniform-continuity', 'continuity', 'compactness', 'analysis']"

Trying to work this out from (#3) here: http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~agupta/graph/Sol-H2.pdf the latter is very insightful.  However applying what I think is going on I take there to be, starting with a chain of 5 edges with the ends vertices which I call u and v.  Now if u and v are connected we would have a graph with 5 vertices and a girth of 5; a pentagon.  Now if u and v are not connected we have that there are k-1 vertices that u could be connected and the same with v.  Now either way u and v have to be connected to something so as to create a cycle hence there are k-2 edges coming out of each u and v.  So if I multiply $(k-2)(k-2)$ and add the number of vertices already in the graph (5) we would have the equation $(k-2)^{2}+5 = k^{2}-4k+4+5= k^{2}-4k+9$. Now if we have the 2-regular graph with girth 5 (the pentagon) then I plug in k=2 and get $2^{2}-4(2)+9 = 5$ which is precisely equal to $k^2 + 1 = (2)^{2}+1 = 5$.  This however is not greater than the original proposition of $k^{2} + 1$ instead it equals it.

(In other words, the isolated singularity at $\infty$ is removable) Hint : Show first, by use of Cauchy's integral formula, that $f = f_1 +f_2$
where $f_1(z) \to 0$ for $z \to \infty$ and $f_2(z)$ is analytic in the whole plane. My attempt: $f$ is analytic in the exterior of some disk $\{|z|\geq R_0 \}$. For large enough $|z|$ the circle $C_1(z)$ around $z$ with radius one lies in the domain of analyticity, and we can apply Cauchy's integral formula: 
$$f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C_1(z)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z} \mathrm{d} \zeta=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{C_1(z)}\frac{\Re f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z} \mathrm{d} \zeta+\frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{C_1(z)}\frac{\Im f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z} \mathrm{d} \zeta. $$

Let $\beta\equiv$ the topology defined by these seminorms. Show that $(C_{b}(X),\beta)$ is a LCS that is complete, $\beta$ is called the strict topology . I was able to solve this problem by following the definition and prove everything step by step. However I am wondering what is the importance of this concept? It seems to me the strict topology should be ""finer"" than the sup-norm topology inherited from $C_{b}(X)$ , but it is not clear to me how exactly the difference lies. And on the practical side, what is the use of this concept? Strict topology showed up again after a few pages; on page 107 I was asked to show if $X$ is locally compact, then a subset of $C_{b}(X)$ is $\beta$ -bounded if and only if it is (sup-)norm bounded. I can prove this by following the definition. And $(C_{b}(X),\beta)$ is metrizable if and only if $X$ is compact. Since an LCS is metrizable if and only if it is (Hausdorff) and first countable, I have to prove that if $X$ is compact, then $(C_{b}(X),\beta)$ is first countable. This is the same as showing the zero map is a $G_{\delta}$ set in $(C_{b}(X),\beta)$ by problem 5. At this point I found I am stuck; I do not see the connection between $X$ being compact and $0$ -map is a $G_{\delta}$ set right away.

446191,Quantitative Transversality,"I came across the following problem while reading some literature in Dynamical Systems. Say I have an ambient Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a pair of transverse embedded disks $D_1, D_2$ of complementary dimension. With some conditions, the common result in this situation is that the set $D_1 \cap D_2$ is finite. For my purposes, though, what I'd like is to have a lower bound on the distance between any two points of $D_1, D_2$. Obviously I need a notion of distance, hence the Riemannian metric $g$ on the ambient space $M$. However, it's also clear that I need some way of controlling the 'robustness' of the transversality of $D_1, D_2$, and also some way of controlling how wild the embeddings of $D_1, D_2$ are. Question 1: Given a uniform bound on the minimal angle $\theta_z$ between $T_z D_1$ and $T_z D_2$ in the metric $g$, where $z \in D_1 \cap D_2$, and some control over the second fundamental forms of $D_1, D_2$, is there a way to bound from below the minimal distance between two distinct points of $D_1 \cap D_2$? Clarification: The situation in my head is where $D_1$ is practically flat and $D_2$ can be very curved. What I want is a lower bound on either of the $D_1$ or $D_2$ distances between elements of $D_1 \cap D_2$. Question 2: Is there a name for this kind of problem? I feel like the methods used in the solution to this problem will be simple, but the overall estimate will likely be somewhat more tedious than an exercise. I would be very happy to be pointed to a geometry reference that carries out an example of this kind of computation.

446348,How many different Forsyth-Edwards Notation ranks are possible?,"(This is a combinatorics question, and therefore more appropriate here than at the Chess Stack Exchange.) Background: in chess, board positions are recorded using a system called Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN for short). The rows (called ""ranks"" in chess) are written from left to right, starting at the top of the board and continuing to the bottom. The pieces are listed with letters: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, N for knight, and P for pawn. Uppercase letters are used for white pieces and lowercase for the black pieces. Empty spaces are denoted by numbers; ranks are separated by slashes. See the Wikipedia article for a full explanation and examples. My question is, how many ranks are possible? No positions illegal due to rules of pawn promotion or castling may occur given only one rank, so the sole restrictions from chess rules are: There cannot be more than two kings on the same rank, and if that is the case they must be opposite colours. The kings cannot be next to each other (kK and Kk are invalid) A king cannot have a queen or rook on both sides of it surrounded by empty space Both kings cannot be in check at the same time. This translates into: if both kings are on the same rank, it is invalid to have only empty space between each king and an opposing Qq or Rr. I cannot decide whether it is relevant that empty spaces are condensed into a single number (four consecutive empty spaces are written as 4 rather than 1111). The initial count of the possible ranks without kings is very high: with $11$ square types (the six piece types, minus the king, times two colours, plus an empty square), and eight available squares, the total number is $11^8 = 214358881$. Continuing, we can explore the case where there is one king. There are $8$ squares to place it and $2$ colours, so there are $16$ initial ways to place the king. There are $7$ remaining squares and $11$ remaining square types, so the total number of piece arrangements is $16 \times 11^7 = 311794736$. But many of these are illegal, because they have the king in check from two pieces at once. We must also consider that if there is a non-horizontal piece between a king and checking piece, then the position will become legal. If the checking pieces are one square away from each other (only the king between them), then there are $11^5 = 161051$ ways to populate the rest of the rank. Multiply this by $6$ available squares for the king to get $966306$. If the checking pieces are two squares apart, the three pieces have $10$ different placements and the rest of the rank can be populated in $11^4 = 14641$ ways (total $146410$). If they are three squares apart, there are $12$ arrangements and $11^3$ ways to populate the rest of the rank ($15972$). Continuing on, four squares apart yield $1452$ illegal arrangements, five squares yield $110$, and six yield $6$. The total number of illegal arrangements is thus $966306 + 146410 + 15972 + 1452 + 110 + 6 = 1130256$. The pieces can also be $2$ different colours, and there are $2$ possible checking pieces, so the total number of illegal ranks with one king is $1130256 \times 2 \times 2 = 4521024$.

I've tried… Residue calculus—it's easy to integrate the similar $\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(tx)}{x^2+2} \mathrm{d}x$ largely because the integrand is even, but this integrand isn't. Similarly $\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(tx)}{x^2+2} \mathrm{d}x$ seems hard. Even if the original integral was from $1$ to $\infty$, so the denominator was even about $x=1$, we seem to need this latter, hard integral involving $\sin(tx)$. Mathematica—even for $t=1$, it gives the answer in terms of $$\int_0^z \frac{\sin(t)}{t}\,\mathrm dt \quad \text{and}\quad \int_0^z \dfrac{\cos(t)}{t}\,\mathrm dt,$$ which is not helpful. Looked through Gamelin's Complex Analysis text for inspiration; everything close used even or odd integrands. Googling/searching here, though it's hard to search for such a specific type of integral. There's a chance there's just a typo on the old prelim, for what it's worth.","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis']"
446386,Is there finest topology which makes given vector space into a topological vector space?,"I we are given a vector space $(V,+,\cdot)$ over a field $\mathbb K$ (where $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb K=\mathbb C$), is there the finest topology $\mathcal T$, such that $(V,\mathcal T)$ is a topological vector space ? I'll explain below what I have tried. This seems a very natural question to me, so I guess the answer (whether it is affirmative or negative) should be well known, at least to some local experts in topological vector spaces. First guess would be the discrete topology, but discrete topology does not give a topological vector space. Indeed, if $\cdot \colon \mathbb K\times V\to V$ is continuous then for each fixed $v\in V$ the map $\alpha \mapsto \alpha\cdot v$ from $\mathbb K$ to $V$ should be continuous. Since the map is injective for $v\ne0$, this would imply that $\mathbb K$ has discrete topology too. Perhaps we could get a topology such that the maps $\alpha \mapsto \alpha\cdot u$, $v \mapsto \beta\cdot v$, $v\mapsto v+u$ are continuous for each $u\in V$ and $\beta\in\mathbb K$ by iteratively taking the initial topology w.r.t. these maps, starting from the discrete topology on $V$ and the usual topology on $\mathbb K$ and iterating this proces. But even if this worked, we would get only separate continuity for $\cdot \colon \mathbb K\times V\to V$, and we want this map to be jointly continuous. While looking for answer to my question, I found out about the existence of finest locally convex topology ( Google Books ), which is mentioned, for example
in this question or this question .
This is different from what I am asking here.","['general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

I also thought if we let $\alpha = \beta$ then I could write $\tan(\alpha+ \alpha) = 1$ 
(does this also mean $\tan(2\alpha) = 1$?) then: $\tan(\alpha + \alpha) = \dfrac{\tan\alpha + \tan\alpha}{1- \tan\alpha\tan\alpha}$ which gives: $1 = \dfrac{2\tan\alpha}{1-\tan^2\alpha}$ Anyway  these are my thoughts so far, any hints would be really appreciated.",['trigonometry']

446431,Does every unital ring contain all the integers?,"Let us suppose there is a ring $R$ with the multiplicative identity $1$. We know that $1+r\in R$, where $r$ is any element of the ring $R$. Does this mean $1+1$ is also part of the ring, or does $r$ have to be an element of the ring different from $1$? Is $1+1$ called $2$ in the ring? Similarly, as $-1$ is also part of the ring, is $-1+ -1$ called $-2$ in the ring? If it is, then I suppose all integers are contained in every unital ring. These questions are very elementary. However, I read contradictory remarks in some places which tend to confuse me. So I thought it would be best to clear any doubts, however trivial the questions.

446463,Electrodynamics in general spacetime,"Let $M\cong\mathbb{R}^4_1$ be the usual Minkowski spacetime. Then we can formulate electrodynamics in a Lorentz invariant way by giving the EM-field $2$-form $\mathcal{F}\in\Omega^2(M)$ and reformuling the homogeneous Maxwell equations as
$$d\mathcal{F} = 0$$
Then the Poincaré lemma tells us that the first of the two equations (i.e. $\mathcal{F}$ is closed) implies that $\mathcal{F} = d\mathcal{A}$ for some $\mathcal{A}\in\Omega^1(M)$ (i.e. $\mathcal{F}$ is exact). $\mathcal{A}$ is the usual potential for ED. This automatically gives us the Gauge symmetry $\mathcal{A}'=\mathcal{A}+d\chi$, for any $\chi\in C^\infty(M)$. My question is: say we want to treat ED  on ageneral spacetime, i.e. any $4$-semi-Rimannian manifold $(M,g)$ using the same Maxwell equations. Then if $H^2(M)\neq 0$ (the $2$nd cohomology group) we don't have anymore that $\mathcal{F} = d\mathcal{A}$, and we also lose the Gauge symmetry, which would make things harder. How is the problem approached? How do you treat ED in general spacetime?","['electromagnetism', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'mathematical-physics', 'quantum-field-theory']"
446466,Is there a nonnormal operator with spectrum strictly continuous?,"Let $H$ be an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. Definition : An operator $A \in B(H)$ is normal if $AA^{*} = A^{*}A$. Definition : The spectrum $\sigma(A)$ of $A \in B(H)$, is the set of all $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $A - \lambda I$ is not bijective. It decomposes as follows: - Point spectrum : $\sigma_{p}(A) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : A - \lambda I \text{ not injective}   \}$ - Continuous spectrum : $\sigma_{c}(A) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : A - \lambda I \ \text{ injective with a dense nonclosed range}   \}$ - Residual spectrum : $\sigma_{r}(A) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : A - \lambda I \ \text{ injective with a nondense range}   \}$ Examples : Let $S$ be the bilateral shift defined on $H = l^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ by $S.e_{n} = e_{n+1} $. Its spectrum is strictly continuous :   $\sigma(S) = \sigma_{c}(S) = \mathbb{S}^{1}$. It's also a unitary operator ($SS^{*} = S^{*}S = I$), so a fortiori a normal operator. Let $T$ be the unilateral shift defined on $H = l^{2}(\mathbb{N})$ by $T.e_{n} = e_{n+1} $. Its spectrum is not strictly continuous because $0 \in \sigma_{r}(T)$. It's a nonnormal operator because $[T^{*},T].e_{0} = e_{0}$. Is there a nonnormal operator with spectrum strictly continuous ? Bonus questions : Can we exclude the compact operators ?

446481,"Relations between irreducibility on $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, and on $\mathbb{Q}_p[x]$ ($p$-adic numbers)","I'm reading "" $p-$ adic numbers: An introduction"" by Fernando Q.Gouvêa, and I'm currently on page 79 of the book. Problem 121. Show that the equation $(X^2 - 2)(X^2 - 17)(X^2 - 34) = 0$ has a root in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ , for all $p \le \infty$ , but has no root in $\mathbb{Q}$ . Ok, I'm fine with this question. We just need to consider 3 cases: $p = 2$ , then $X^2 - 17 = 0$ has a root, because $17 \equiv 1 (\mbox{ mod }8)$ $p = 17$ , then $X^2 - 2 = 0$ has a root, because $6^2 \equiv 2 (\mbox{ mod }7)$ , so it's an application of Helsel's lemma. $p \notin \{ 2; 17 \}$ , then if 2, and 17 are both not perfect square in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ , then 34 must be. So by Hensel's lemma, one of the 3 factors must have a root. I'm typing problem 121 in because I think the following problem, which I'm stuck is kind of related to it. Problem 123. Decide whether it's true that a polynomial in one variable with coefficient in $\mathbb{Z}$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ iff it's irreducible in all $\mathbb{Q}_p[X]$ , for all $p \le \infty$ . I'm fine with this problem too, it's false, the $\Rightarrow$ is incorrect, since $X^2 - 2$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ , but not in $\mathbb{Q}_{17}[X]$ as shown above. Problem 123 (Modified). Decide whether it's true that a polynomial in one variable with coefficient in $\mathbb{Z}$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ iff it's irreducible for some $\mathbb{Q}_p[X]$ . I think this is false too, so I have tried to find a counter example (i.e some polynomial that is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ , and then point out it's reducible for all $\mathbb{Q}_p[X]$ ), but without any luck. Am I on the right track? Should it be true? Thanks guys so much, And have a good day,","['polynomials', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
