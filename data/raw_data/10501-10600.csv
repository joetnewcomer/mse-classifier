80207,How to determine whether or not this series converges?,$$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{n^{-1/2}}{2+\sin^2(n)}$$ I tried the divergence test but it approaches 0.

80219,Finding 'verbally smallest' element of a finitely generated group,"Let $G = ({\Large\ast}^n\mathbb{Z})/K$ be a group, and for each $g \in G$ define $l(g)$ as the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g = g_1 \ldots g_m$, where each $g_i$ is a generator of $G$. Now let $H < G$. The problem is finding $\operatorname{arg\,min}_{g \in H \setminus \{1\}} l(g)$. My motivation is the commutator-based magic' puzzle posted by Gil Kalai here , which boils down to finding a non-trivial element of $\bigcap_{i=1}^n \operatorname{ker}p_i$, where $p_i: {\Large\ast}_{j = 1}^n \mathbb{Z}a_j \to {\Large\ast}_{j \neq i}\mathbb{Z}a_j$ is defined by $p_i(a_j) = a_j$ when $i \neq j$ and $p_i(a_i) = 1$. One non-trivial element is $[\ldots[a_1, a_2], a_3], \ldots], a_n]$, but I heard people complaining that it's too long and the corresponding loop will be too hard to draw, so I'm now interested in finding a smaller solution, if it exists.

  three sides of a triangle in their interior points but failed for, to
  my consternation, I realized that I have no notion of what a straight
  line is. Assume the standard Euclidean geometry of the plane. What is the simplest way to prove this statement? Can it be done without analytic geometry?

I tried to start simple, showing that if $x = \delta_n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ then $P_x$ isn't dense. This worked out, but I was exploiting a symmetry that doesn't exist when considering finite linear combinations of such elements. I'm pretty sure this idea isn't going to work out. Then I tried considering translating this operator to an operator on $L^2(S^1)$ via the Fourier transform. The corresponding operator $\hat{T}$ is simply a multiplication operator, the multiplying function being $g(t) = 2\cos(t)$. This seemed more promising initially, but I still don't see how to approach the problem outside of explicitly constructing an element $y_x$ s.t. $y_x \notin \bar{P}_x$  for arbitrary $x$. Any hints or pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated. Edit: Working in the $L^2(S^1)$ setting, the problem amounts to showing that $\forall f\in L^2(S^1)$ $\exists h \in L^2(S^1)$ such that $h$ cannot be approximated in $L^2$ norm by functions of the form $(\sum_{n=0}^m c_n cos^n(t))f(t).$ This seems like it should be clear, but I have been unable to prove it for general $f$.","['operator-theory', 'spectral-theory', 'harmonic-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

(15 answers) Closed 8 years ago . It recently came to my mind, how to prove that the factorial grows faster than the exponential, or that the linear grows faster than the logarithmic, etc... I thought about writing:
$$
a(n) = \frac{k^n}{n!} = \frac{ k \times k \times \dots \times k}{1\times 2\times\dots\times n} = \frac k1 \times \frac k2 \times \dots \times \frac kn = \frac k1 \times \frac k2 \times \dots \times \frac kk \times \frac k{k+1} \times \dots \times \frac kn
$$
It's obvious that after k/k, every factor is smaller than 1, and by increasing n, k/n gets closer to 0, like if we had $\lim_{n \to \infty} (k/n) = 0$, for any constant $k$. But, I think this is not a clear proof... so any hint is accepted.

80600,Is Lindeberg's condition satisfied when variances of the sequence of r.v.'s are bounded from above and below?,"This question is related to my previous question but I think it's sufficiently different to warrant a separate one. Suppose I have a sequence of independently distributed positive random variables: $X_1\sim A_1,X_2\sim A_2, \ldots, X_n\sim A_n$, where $A_i$'s have support over $[0,\infty)$. Furthermore, suppose that, for each $X_i$, variance $\sigma_{lb}^2<\sigma_i^2<\sigma_{ub}^2$, that is variances of $X_i$'s are bounded from below and above. Does Lindeberg's Condition : $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{s_n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\int_{\{|x-\mu_i|>\epsilon s_n\}}(x-\mu_i)^2f_i(x)dx=0$$ hold in this case?  Here $s_n^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2$ and $s_n=\sqrt{s_n^2}$. My intuition tells me that it does, for the following reason: suppose that it doesn't hold.  That means there is some random variable $X_i$ in the sequence most of whose mass isn't centered in an interval about the mean $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$.  However, this interval gets larger as we add more random variables to the sequence, since their variances are bounded from below.  Since the variance of $X_i$ is upper-bounded, at some $n$, the interval $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$ should ""consume"" most of $X_i$'s mass. However, I am not sure how to prove (or disprove) it.  One problem may arise if the interval $[\mu_i-\epsilon s_n,\mu_i+\epsilon s_n]$ does not increase fast enough...

$$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2k}{k} \binom{2n-2k}{n-k} (-1)^k = 2^n \binom{n}{n/2}$$
when $n$ is even.  (Clearly the sum is $0$ when $n$ is odd.)  The nice expression on the right-hand side indicates that there should be a pretty combinatorial proof of this statement.  The proof should start by associating objects with even parity and objects with odd parity counted by the left-hand side.  The number of leftover (unassociated) objects should have even parity and should ""obviously"" be $2^n \binom{n}{n/2}$.  I'm having trouble finding such a proof, though.  So, my question is Can someone produce a combinatorial proof that, for even $n$, $$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2k}{k} \binom{2n-2k}{n-k} (-1)^k = 2^n \binom{n}{n/2}?$$ Some thoughts so far: Combinatorial proofs for $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2k}{k} \binom{2n-2k}{n-k}  = 4^n$ are given by Phira here and by Brian M. Scott here .  The proofs are basically equivalent.  In Phira's argument, both sides count the number of paths of length $2n$ starting from $(0,0)$ using steps of $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$.  By conditioning on the largest value of $2k$ for which a particular path returns to the horizontal axis at $(2k,0)$ and using the facts that there are $\binom{2k}{k}$ paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2k,0)$ and $\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ paths of length $2n-2k$ that start at the horizontal axis but never return to the axis we obtain the left-hand side. With these interpretations of the central binomial coefficients $2^n \binom{n}{n/2}$ could count (1) paths that do not return to the horizontal axis by the path's halfway point of $(n,0)$, or (2) paths that touch the point $(n,0)$.  But I haven't been able to construct the association that makes these the leftover paths (nor do all of these paths have even parity anyway).  So perhaps there's some other interpretation of $2^n \binom{n}{n/2}$ as the number of leftover paths. Update. Some more thoughts : There's another way to view the identity $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2k}{k} \binom{2n-2k}{n-k}  = 4^n$.  Both sides count the number of lattice paths of length $n$ when north, south, east, and west steps are allowed.  The right side is obvious. The left side has a similar interpretation as before: $\binom{2k}{k}$ counts the number of NSEW lattice paths of length $k$ that end on the line $y=0$, and $\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ counts the number of NSEW lattice paths of length $n-k$ that never return to the line $y =0$.  So far, this isn't much different as before.  However, $2^n \binom{n}{n/2}$ has an intriguing interpretation: It counts the number of NSEW lattice paths that end on the diagonal $y = x$ (or, equivalently, $y = -x$).  So maybe there's an involution that leaves these as the leftover paths.

80659,Opposite of a contraction mapping,"I am taking Real Analysis and we recently went over the Banach Fixed-point Theorem, also commonly known as the Contraction Mapping Theorem which states: If $(X,d)$ is a complete metric space, and $f:X\to X$ is a contraction, that is $f$ satisfies $$d(f(x),f(y)) \leq L d(x,y)$$ for every $x,y \in X$ and some fixed $L<1$, then $f$ has exactly one fixed point, i.e. there exists a unique $z \in X$ such that $f(z)=z$. I was thinking about a similar statement for what I can only guess are called expansion mappings. Suppose $(X,d)$ is a complete metric space and $f:X\to X$ satisfies
$$ d(f(x),f(y)) \geq L d(x,y)$$ for some fixed $L>1$ and every $x,y \in X$ with $x\neq y$. Does $f$ necessarily have exactly one fixed point? I could not come up with a counterexample using real functions, though I haven't really had time (due to homework) to put much more thought into it. I googled ""expansion mapping"" and some other similar terms but there does not seem to be any useful source on the topic that I could find. I think this notion of expansion mapping is a natural one to consider after considering contraction mappings, so I don't know why there doesn't seem to be any available research on the topic. I have a few good ideas for how I would go about trying to prove this that might help. Firstly we note that $f$ must be injective, otherwise we would have two distinct points which get closer (distance zero) after applying the mapping which would be a contradiction. Thus $f$ is left invertible. If I had to guess, I would say that the left inverse of an expansion mapping must be a contraction mapping (with reciprocal constant $\frac{1}{L}$?). Then that contraction must have a fixed point by the Banach Fixed-point Theorem. Perhaps it can be shown that this must also be a fixed point of $f$ itself, I haven't taken the time to see whether fixed points are preserved using only one-sided invertibility.

80702,"""indecomposability"" in theory of groups and topological spaces","One can define the notion of ""indecomposable"" in many of the categories that mathematicians think about. However there's no real reason, as far as I can see, to expect it to behave at all well. Here are two examples. 1) Say a group is indecomposable if it is not the trivial group, and not isomorphic to a product $H\times K$ with $H$ and $K$ groups, and neither of them the trivial group. Can one find a group which can be written both as a product of two indecomposable groups, and as a product of three indecomposable groups? 2) Say a topological space is indecomposable if it has more than one element, and is not isomorphic to a product $X\times Y$, with $X$ and $Y$ topological spaces both having more than one element. Can one find a topological space which can be written as a product of two indecomposable spaces, and also as a product of three indecomposable spaces? In both cases the notion of indecomposability seems a bit artificial, or at least not commonly used, so I suspect that one can find such funny examples in both cases. I am pretty sure, for example, that it's not hard to write down a number field whose ring of integers contains elements which are both the product of two irreducibles and three irreducibles, and numbers are a lot easier than either groups or topological spaces. I don't know explicit examples for either Q1 or Q2 though. Does anyone else? I was told by an algebraist that no example of a finite group as in Q1 above can exist, which already surprised me a little. Finite products and finite coproducts coincide in the category of [edit: abelian] groups I guess, but one could also formulate an analogue of Q2 using disjoint unions and this seems much more close to the kind of question that people do actually think about, so we can safely ignore it here :-)","['general-topology', 'group-theory']"
80713,Parametrizing a conic in projective space,"I am just beginning to learn algebraic geometry. An exercise in Reid , p. 24 is to prove that if $Q(x,y,z)$ is a quadratic form over a field $k$ with at least 4 elements, and $Q$ vanishes on the zero set of the conic $\{xz=y^2\}\subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$, then $Q=\lambda (xz-y^2)$. I have solved the problem, I assume in the way the author intended, but in trying to integrate the solution with my previous knowledge, I feel that I am missing something. Can you help me get a sense of ""the real story""? The solution I have: $\{xz=y^2\}\subset \mathbb{P}^2_k$ is parametrized by $(u:v)\in \mathbb{P}^1_k \mapsto (u^2:uv:v^2)\in \mathbb{P}^2_k$. Thus $Q(u^2,uv,v^2)$ vanishes for all choices of $u,v$.  This is a homogeneous polynomial in two variables, so I can interpret its zero set as a set of elements in $\mathbb{P}^1_k$. It is degree 4 so unless it is identically zero as a polynomial, it cannot have more than $4$ zeros in $\mathbb{P}^1_k$. But $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ has at least 5 points, (at least) 4 for the elements of $k$ and also $\infty$. Since $Q(u^2,uv,v^2)$ vanishes on all of them, it must be zero as a polynomial. Now an elementary calculation with generic coefficients for $Q$ shows it has the desired form. (Auxiliary question: is this correct?) This kind of reasoning in terms of projective space is new to me so I sought an alternative solution in the hopes that it would help me understand this solution better. ATTEMPTED alternative solution: Since $Q$ and $xz-y^2$ are low degree and I want to show $(xz-y^2)|Q$, divide $Q$ by $xz-y^2$ in the ring $k(z,y)[x]$ to obtain a remainder $R\in k(z,y)$ since $xz-y^2$ is degree 1 in $x$. Clear the denominator in $R$ to obtain an element of $k[z,y]$. Essentially this amounts to replacing $zx$ with $y^2$ throughout $z^2Q$. Thus $R$ is a homogeneous degree at most 4 polynomial in $y$ and $z$, and by construction it vanishes whenever $xz=y^2$. I want to conclude that $R$ is zero as a polynomial, but I can't do what I did last time because I do not know that $R$ vanishes for every $(y:z)\in \mathbb{P}^1_k$. In particular, I do not know if it vanishes on $(1:0)$, although it does vanish on $(u:1)$, all $u\in k$ (i.e. on a copy of $\mathbb{A}^1_k\subset \mathbb{P}^1_k$), because let $x=u^2$. Thus, e.g. if the field is $\mathbb{F}_4$, I only know that the associated inhomogeneous polynomial to $R$ has four zeros, and this means I do not know it is the zero polynomial. It seems to me that morally, what is going on is that I'm attempting to parametrize $xz=y^2$ by taking $(y:z)\in\mathbb{P}^1$, solving $xz=y^2$ for $x$, and then mapping $(y:z)\in\mathbb{P}^1_k \mapsto (x:y:z)\in\mathbb{P}^2_k$, but this isn't working because if $(y:z)=(1:0)$ then there is no $x$ solving $xz=y^2$. But I remain confused. In particular: Questions: 1) Is there a way to do this without referring to projective space? We are proving a statement about low-degree polynomials in 3 variables. I feel like I should be able to do this with very simple commutative algebra.  (If $k$ is algebraically closed, then the result is immediate from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, but this feels like way too much power and doesn't work if $k$ is, e.g., $\mathbb{F}_4$.) Can you see such a solution? 2) Can you help me understand better ""why"" the second (attempted) solution above didn't work? (Apologies for the vague question. I am going for ""moral / conceptual"" satisfaction, a slippery thing. I will appreciate any attempt to help.) Is there a way to complete that solution using projective or non-projective ideas?

First I was asked if $f(x+iy)=x^2-y^2 + i\sqrt{|xy|}$ satisfies the C-R equations at $0$. So I found $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ $=$ $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ & $-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ $=$ $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ $u=x^2-y^2$ and $v=\sqrt{|xy|}$ So I found $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x$, $-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=2y$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sqrt{y}}{\sqrt{x}}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}$. So obviously it does not satisfy the C-R equations. I was wondering if I have to do anything else because it asks if it satisfies the C-R equations at $0$? The next part of the question asks me if $f$ is differentiable at $0$. And it hints that I should consider $\mathrm{lim}_{r\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(re^{i\theta})}{re^{i\theta}}$. I assume they are meaning $f$ is complex differentiable? (not real differentiable?). How would I determine if f is differentiable at $0$? Because it says on wikipedia that the sole existence of partial derivatives satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations is not enough to ensure complex differentiability at that point. It is necessary to make sure that u and v are real differentiable, which is a stronger condition than the existence of the partial derivatives but it is not necessary to require continuity of these partial derivatives. Then f = u + iv is complex-differentiable at that point if and only if the partial derivatives of u and v satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations at that point. The question I have is, since $f$ does not satisfy the C-R equations (see my calculations above), is there any need to do anything further (in question 2)? Can I just say its not differentiable at $0$? Why did they ask me to consider that limit?

Sorry if my terminology is a bit off, most of my maths is self-taught and I am acutely aware I might be asking a question that reveals some fundamental misunderstandings. The reason I want a Bézier curve is that they can be rendered efficiently on modern graphics hardware. As an example of what I am looking for, I might have a system of differential equations with respect to time: $\begin{align*}\frac{dx}{dt} &= -2x\\ \frac{dy}{dt} &= -2y\\ \frac{dz}{dt} &= -2z\end{align*}$ with initial conditions $x=y=z=1$ at $t=0$ Solved with a time-step method (in practice the systems may not be algebraically solvable) for small increments of $t$ and plotted in 3D space the resulting line traces a circular path around the origin. If I wanted to render this on a computer screen, I could collect a series of points and play 'connect the dots' to draw a crude line which would require recalculation with every adjustment to level of detail. If I could approximate the path as a Bézier curve I would only need to calculate it once to get a line which is smooth at any level of detail. The curve will always be plotted in three dimensions, but the system may be higher dimensional. Is there any way to generate such an approximation algebraically? Should I be looking at generating some points numerically and just fitting a simpler curve to them step by step? Any recommendations on an approach for that?","['approximation', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'bezier-curve', 'numerical-methods']"
80860,Counting walks on colored graphs,"I am looking for help counting distinct walks on a proper vertex coloring of a graph.  To be more specific, let's consider an odd cycle of order greater than 3 that has been properly 3-colored. So, for example, we could color $C_9$ by alternating $r,g,b$ as we moved clockwise around the vertices. Every vertex in $C_9$ is adjacent to two vertices.  With this coloring, every vertex is adjacent to two distinct colors.  The result would be that for any positive integer $k$ there are $(3)(2^{k-1})$ walks on $k$ colored vertices.  Alternatively, we could color one vertex $r$ and then alternate $g,b$ on the others. Now, not every vertex is adjacent to two distinct colors.  For a given $k$, it seems like there should be a formula for the number of walks (on $k$ colored vertices) as a function of the number of vertices that are adjacent to two distinct colors.  However, I am having trouble constructing and proving such a formula.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics']"

 And we also have the $p$-part or $n$-part of the group which occurs in the method of Descent, suppose if $\phi\colon E/K\to E'/K$ is an isogeny of elliptic curves, then you have an exact sequence, $$0\to E'(K)/\phi(E(K)) \to S^{(\phi)}(E/K) \to \text{Ш}(E/K)[\phi]\to 0$$
So one can define the $\phi$-part of Sha-group as $Ш_2(E/\mathbb{Q})=[\rm{Sel_{2}}(E/\mathbb{Q})/(E(\mathbb{Q})/\rm{2}E(\mathbb{Q})]$. We know already that $Ш_2(E/\mathbb{Q})$ can be easily proven to be finite as both $\rm{Sel_2}(E/\mathbb{Q})$ and $E(\mathbb{Q})/\rm{2}E(\mathbb{Q})$ are finite. So my main query is : ""Is there any way to profitably write $Ш(E/\mathbb{Q})$ in terms of $Ш_m(E/\mathbb{Q})$ when we perform an infinite descent. If so that will account for decomposition on Sha."" To add some flavor to it, suppose think that $2$-descent works on elliptic curve $E$, then we obtain the $Ш_2(E/\mathbb{Q})$ and if we proceed for the ""Infinite-Descent"" we obtain for each $E(\mathbb{Q})/\rm{m} E(\mathbb{Q})$ ($m\ge2$) a corresponding Sha-part i.e $Ш_m(E/\mathbb{Q})$ . So can we write the group as
$$Ш(E/\mathbb{Q})=\bigcup_m Ш_m(E/\mathbb{Q})$$ (that might not represent the union but some way of unifying the local-sha(not to be confused with Hasse-Weil word ""local"", here local seems to the one at 'm'), that may be either a Direct sum or something like that.

  integral exists (or is properly infinite), then so does the other one,

I admit that I still don't quite understand Jonas Meyer's excellent answer . But here is my current understanding (not sure if it is related to Jonas' answer), and hope it can be either finished in the same direction, or shown to be wrong: The integrals on both sides of the quoted equation are integrals wrt the Lebesgue measure $m$ on

$\varphi$ in such a way that it induces the Lebesgue measure $m$ on
$\mathbb{R}^n$ from some measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e. $$m(A)=\mu(\varphi_e^{-1}(A)), \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ So $$
\int_{\varphi(U)} f(v)\, dv \;=\; \int_U f(\varphi) \, d\mu $$ Then by some unknown proof , $\mu$ can be shown to be absolutely continuous wrt
the Legesgue measure and its Radon-Nikodym derivative is $\left|\det
\varphi'(u)\right|$ , i.e. $$\mu(A)=\int_A \left|\det
\varphi'(u)\right| du, \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ So $$ \int_{\varphi(U)} f(v)\, dv \;=\; \int_U

For example, the proof of SAS congruence would be quite messy. Euclid's arguments are all ""synthetic"", and it seems hard to carry such arguments out in an analytic framework. 2) What problems exist with Euclid's elements? Why are the axioms unsatisfactory?

$$ y_0=Y_0\quad,\quad y_i = f(y_{i-1},\mathbb E X_i) = f(y_{i-1},0.5)$$ Under what assumptions does $\mathbb E\,Y_N = y_N$ hold? Motivation: The above problem is an abstraction of the analysis of a random search optimization algorithm.
Assume a bijective function $g:S\to\{1,\dots,|S|\}$, which we'd like to maximize and a current iterate $x_i$.
One step of the algorithm consists of choosing a random point $x_{i+1}\in S$ and accepting
it if $g(x_{i+1}) > g(x_i)$. We are interested in the expected function value $g(x_N)$ reached after $N$ improving steps 
when starting in the worst point (for simplicity, we do not count points with lower function value).
For $N \ll |S|$, this leads to the above abstract problem with 
$$f(y,x) = (|S|-y)x+y\;.$$","['stochastic-processes', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"
