788387,Center of $G/Z(G)$.,"Question. Prove or disprove: The center of $G/Z(G)$ is trivial for all finite groups $G$. (Here $Z(G)$ denotes the center of $G$.) Attempt at a Proof.

788541,Misuse of Tangent Vector,"I am quite confused with the term tangent used in differential geometry books. It seems to me that people use this word quite loosely. For example, one definition about tangent space in my book is as follows. The tangent space $T_p(\mathbb R^n)$ at $p\in\mathbb R^n$ is the vector space of all arrows emanating from $p$. If this is the case, then the tangent space at $p$ can be a vector pointing to any direction. However, intuitively a tangent vector is only meaningful with respect to some kind of geometric object such as a surface or curve where the tangent vector at a point is the vector that only touch the surface or curve at point $p$ if it is extended to a plane or line. My question is how to interpret the word tangent in differential geometry. Is it still consistent with the geometric intuition I have from curve and surfaces, please?

788687,Prove that there exists an $m$ such that for any $n>m$ there exists at least one prime between $c_n$ and $n$,"Let $c_n$ be the $n$-th composite. Then the problem is to prove that- $\pi(c_n)-\pi(n)>0$ $\forall n>m$ I have tried to progress in the problem using an elementary approach. So far I have been able to prove the following trivial results- For any $n>7$ the composite $c_n$ satisfies the inequality $2n>c_n>n$. $\pi(c_n)=c_n-n-1$ $\pi(x)\geq \pi(p)$ $\iff$ $x \geq p$. Where $p$ is a prime. Notice that when the R.H.S always implies L.H.S. To prove the converse we note that $\pi(x) > \pi(p)$ $\implies$ $x>p$. The problem occurs when $\pi(x) = \pi(p)$. In that case if $x<p$ then it would imply that $\pi(x) < \pi(p)$, contradicting our hypothesis. Hence proved. The $\pi(c_n)$-th prime is strictly less then $c_n$ for any $n>7$. $c_n$$_-$$_\pi$$_($$_n$$_)$$_-$$_1$ $=$ $n-1$ $\iff$ $n$ is a prime and $c_n$$_-$$_\pi$$_($$_n$$_)$$_-$$_1$ $=$ $n$ $\iff$ $n$ is a composite. Using 5 it can be proved that $c_n$ $\geq$ $n+\pi(n)+1$. But what I want is strict inequality. I have proved that the function $\Psi(n)=c_n-n-\pi(n)-1$ is increasing between two consecutive primes. Notice that the statement of the problem is equivalent to the following statement- Prove that the $\pi(c_n)$-th prime is strictly greater then $n$ for any $n > m$.

788769,Margin of error for quotient of two measurements,"I need to find the total margin of error for calculating velocity, while I have margins of error for time and distance. Actually the margins are the same (as both measurements were based on GPS - but this is not important here), and are given as 1/365000 (20 cm for 730 km). So, I spent quite some time studying various information, most of which was about standard deviation (which I understand vaguely) and found here (but not only) that the formula I should use is: if $S=A×B$ or $A/B$ then $σ_S/S=\sqrt{(σ_A/A)^2+(σ_B/B)^2}$ Well, let's  take an easy example. Say I have two measurements: distance of 40 m and time of 4 sec; both margins are the same and equal 0.2 (huuuuge, I know). The above formula (if I am interpreting it correctly) would give me the margin of $σ_S/S=\sqrt{(0.2)^2+(0.2)^2}=\sqrt{0.04+0.04}= 0.2828$ (for the calculated velocity of 10 m/s). Therefore the lowest actual velocity can be $v=7,172 m/s$. Now, let's try to calculate the maximum error from actual numbers for distance and time. For the distance I can have measured up so the actual distance might even be as low as 33,33333 m, while for the time I can have measured down, which gives me the maximum possible time of 5 s. The real velocity would have been then $v=33,3333m/5s=6,66667 m/s$, which means I was wrong by 0,3333. Obviously, the above calculation shows the theoretical equation underestimated the margin of error, as it said the error cannot exceed 0.2828. On the other hand, I found elsewhere, yet without any explanation (but from a credible source) that in such case I should have calculated the total margin of error as simply a square root of 0,2 (or 1/365000 in my original problem). In such case the total margin of error equals 0.4472, which - although much higher than what I calculated in my example - is not underestimated at least. What do I do wrong, and - if the error of margin in my simple example really is 0.4472 (i.e. square root of a margin of error for the distance or time) than - why do I calculate it this way?","['statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'error-propagation']"

(Lagrange Remainder): $$e^x = 1 + x + \frac12x^2 +\frac{1}{3!}e^{\xi}x^3,$$ but in this case it is $$e^x = 1 + x + \frac12x^2 +\frac{1}{2!}e^{\theta(x)}x^2$$. The properties of $\theta$ do not make much sense. Am I missing something?","['taylor-expansion', 'analysis']"

788898,Abelization of symmetric groups and its subgroups of bounded support,"For $X$ a finite set one can show easily that the abelization of the symmetric group on $X$ is given by the group of order $2$ and that the commutator subgroup of $\operatorname{Sym}X$ is given by the group of even permutations: Proof: Consider the $\operatorname{sign}\colon\operatorname{Sym}X\longrightarrow\{\pm1\}$. Since the two-element-group is commutative, we find $[\operatorname{Sym}X,\operatorname{Sym}X]\subseteq\ker\operatorname{sign}=\operatorname{Alt}X$. Since the symmetric group is not commutative, the commutator subgroup is a nontrivial normal subgroup of the alternating group and by simplicity of the latter, we find that the commutator subgroup is equal to $\operatorname{Alt}X$. (The cases $\operatorname{card}X=1,2,4$ of course need a slight variation because of lacking noncommutativity or simplicity of the alternating group). Question 1: For $X$ infinite, I have read that the abelization of $\operatorname{Sym}X$ is trivial. Is there an elementary way to see this? Elementary in particular means that the argument makes no use of the classification of normal subgroups of the symmetric group. Question 2: Let $I$ be the category asssociated to the preordered set of finite cardinals and denote by $F\colon I\longrightarrow\mathbf{Grp}$ the functor which associates to each cardinal $\alpha$ the symmetric group on $\alpha$. The colimit of this functor is then isomorphic to the group of permutations with support stricitly less then $\aleph_0$, which is usually called the finitary symmetric group and which I denote by $\operatorname{Sym}_{\aleph_0}X$ for $X$ a set of cardinality $\ge\aleph_0$. Since the abelization functor is left adjoint to the natural fucntor $\mathbf{Ab}\longrightarrow\mathbf{Grp}$ and thus commutes with colimits, the abelization of the finitary symmetric group is given by the group of order $2$, aswell.
My second question is, wether this argument can be generalized to arbitrary cardinal numbers. Maybe my questions are simple to answer, but since I don't know a lot of either category theory, or set theory or algebra, I need some help.","['category-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

The fibres of $g$ are diffeomorphic to one another, and each of them is called a Milnor fibre of $f$ at $0\in\mathbb C^{n+1}$. In the Introduction of these notes on vanishing cycles, the author states: ""The cohomology of the Milnor fibre is known to be nonzero in degrees between $0$ and $n$ at most [$\dots$]"" In the next paragraph, the author states that the Milnor fiber $F$ of an isolated singular point has the same homotopy type of a bouquet of $\mu(f)$ spheres, where $\mu(f)$ is the Milnor number of $f$, namely the dimension of the vector space $\mathbb C[[x_0,\dots,x_n]]/(\textrm{Jac}(f))$.

EDIT: I just realized that step (2) is definitely wrong, as both those limits are undefined.  Still, the sum of two undefined limits can still be defined so I'm not sure how to proceed. Proof: First we note that $$
\lim_{z \rightarrow \overline{0}} e^{1 / iz}  = 0
$$ $$
\lim_{z \rightarrow \overline{0}} e^{-1/iz}  = \infty
$$ so that $$
\lim_{z \to \overline{0}} \left| \underbrace{e^{1 / iz}}_{\rightarrow 0} + \underbrace{e^{-1 / iz}}_{\rightarrow \infty} \right| = \infty
$$ Similarly, we have that $$
\lim_{z \rightarrow 0+} e^{1 / iz}  = 0
$$ $$
\lim_{z \rightarrow 0+} e^{-1/iz}  = 0
$$ so that $$
\lim_{z \to 0+} \left| \underbrace{e^{1 / iz}}_{\rightarrow 0} + \underbrace{e^{-1 / iz}}_{\rightarrow 0} \right| = 0
$$ Putting this together yields that $$
0 \ne \lim_{z \rightarrow 0} \left| e^{1 / iz} + e^{-1 / iz} \right| \ne \infty
$$ so that $$
0 \ne \lim_{z \to 0} |z|^{\alpha} \left| e^{1 / iz} + e^{-1 / iz} \right| \ne \infty \text{ for any } \alpha \in \mathbb{R}
$$ Then we have showed that the function $e^{1/iz} + e^{-1/iz}$ has an essential singularity at $0$.  This then implies that $$
{e^{1/iz} + e^{-1/iz} \over 2}
$$ also has an essential singularity at $0$. Yet by definition this means that $$
\cos(z) = {e^{iz} + e^{-iz} \over 2}
$$ has an essential singularity at $\infty$.","['proof-verification', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

Then $F \subseteq A \times B$. By the axiom of specification, $F$ must exists (if I didn't mess up something). But the book I'm reading, Elements of Set Theory by Enderton, says that no function could have a nonempty domain and an empty range, and no more detail is given. So my confusion arises. His statement against my proof. The only axiom as far as I know to prove such a set does not exist is the axiom of regularity. But I can't give such a proof. So I need help. I hope someone could clearly explain why such a function doesn't exist, and why this doesn't contradict the axiom of specification. Let me explain my confusion in more detail: First of all, I know that $A \times \emptyset$ is empty. But $ \emptyset \times A$ is also an empty set, yet there is no problem with functions with an empty domain . The book I'm reading defines a function as: ""A function is a relation such that for each $x$ in $\operatorname{dom} F$ there is only one $y$ such that $x \mathop F y$."" and a relation as: ""A relation is a set of ordered pairs."" Now, let me define the function $F$ as: $$F =  \{\langle x,y \rangle \mid x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \text{ and ... other conditions} \}$$  so it's equal to: $$F = \{ \langle x,y \rangle \in A \times B \mid \text{... other conditions} \}.$$ Doesn't that mean that $F$ meets the conditions of the axiom of specification, and therefore exists? What I would specifically like to ask is: How do you define a function $F$ (as precisely as possible)? Why does the argument above not imply that a function $F: A \to B$ always exists? Does $F \subseteq A \times B$ still hold when $B = \emptyset$?

\begin{equation*}
f = \left[

We have that

\frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial y} &= -3y^{2}

\begin{alignat*}{2}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial y} &= -1 -2y^{2} \\
&< 0 &&\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{alignat*} By the Bendixson criterion, there are no periodic orbits (other than singular points) in a simply connected domain when $f$ is continuously differentiable and $\text{div}(f)$ does not change sign nor does it vanish identically.  Thus, the system has no periodic orbits. I find myself at an impasse for a distinct alternative proof. 
First, I tried a change to polar coordinates.  The result I got was
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\left[
\begin{matrix}
\dot{r}\\
\dot{\theta}

\right].

From here I did not see a clear way of solving for $r$ and $\theta$ 
or analyzing $\dot{r}$ to rule out periodicity. Another approach that I considered was to use the theory associated with the Poincare-Bendixson theorem.  For instance, if I could show that every solution crosses a transversal an infinite number of times then I could rule out a periodic solution.  However, I was not sure how to construct such an argument from the given system. I also wonder if an eigenvalue analysis of a linearization could be used here as well?

789369,Computing $\int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz|$ when $0 > \rho \ne |a|$,"Goal: In what follows we let $\gamma = \rho e^{it}$ on $0 \le t \le 2\pi$ serve as the paramaterization of the curve $|z| = \rho$.  We also assume that $\rho > 0$ (else the computation is trivially equal to zero). We wish to compute $$
\int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz| 
$$ when $0 < \rho \ne |a|$. Attempt, with questions in step (3) and (4): We have that \begin{align*}
= & \int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {1 \over (z-a)^2 \overline{(z - a)^2}}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {1 \over (z-a)^2 (\overline{z} - \overline{a})^2}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_0^{2 \pi} {1 \over (\rho e^{i t} - a)^2 (\rho e^{-i t} - \overline{a})^2} |i\rho e^{i t}|\ dt\\
= & \rho \int_0^{2 \pi} {1 \over (\rho e^{i t} - a)^2 (\rho e^{-i t} - \overline{a})^2} \ dt\\
\end{align*} As a consequence, we can say either of the following: \begin{equation*}
\tag{*}
\int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz| = \rho \int_0^{2 \pi} {{1 \over (\rho e^{i t} - a)^2} \over (\rho e^{-i t} - \overline{a})^2} \ dt
\end{equation*} or also \begin{equation*}
\tag{**}
\int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz| = \rho \int_0^{2 \pi} {{1 \over (\rho e^{-i t} - \overline{a})^2} \over (\rho e^{i t} - a)^2} \ dt
\end{equation*} Now if $\rho < |a|$, then doesn't the fact that ${1 \over (z-a)^4}$ is analytic on the disk of size $\rho$ imply that the integral is zero (via Cauchy's integral theorem on a disk)? On the other hand, if $\rho > |a|$, can we apply Cauchy's Integral Formula to the numerator of, say, $(*)$  to yield the computation? EDIT: Substituting $|dz| = {-i\rho \over z}\  dz$ and $\overline{z} = {\rho^2 \over z}$ yields: \begin{align*}
= & \int_{|z|=\rho} {1 \over |z-a|^{4}}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {1 \over (z-a)^2 \overline{(z - a)^2}}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {1 \over (z-a)^2 (\overline{z} - \overline{a})^2}\ |dz| \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {1 \over (z-a)^2 ({\rho^2 \over z} - \overline{a})^2}\ {-i\rho \over z}\  dz \\
= & \int_{|z| = \rho} {{-i\rho \over z({\rho^2 \over z} - \overline{a})^2} \over (z-a)^2 }\ \  dz \\
\end{align*} But it seems like here Cauchy's Integral Formula doesn't apply since ${-i\rho \over z({\rho^2 \over z} - \overline{a})^2}$ is undefined at $0$ and hence not analytic inside $\gamma$.","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous.","Suppose that $f: [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)$ exists. Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,\infty)$. Here's my solution, but because the problem has been given in a math contest preparation program I'm afraid that there's some point that I might be missing. Since $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)$ exists, there exists $L \in \mathbb{R}$ such that: $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists M>0 \text{ such that } x > M \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon/2$ $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists M>0 \text{ such that } y > M \implies |f(y)-L|<\epsilon/2$ Therefore, $\forall x,y \in (M,\infty)$ we have shown that:
$|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. Now, let's consider $f$ on $[0,M]$. Since $[0,M]$ is a compact interval and $f$ is continuous, $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,M]$: $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists \delta_1>0, \forall x,y \in [0,M]: |x-y|<\delta_1 \implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. Now let us focus our attention at $x=M$. Since $f: [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, it is continuous at $x=M$ as well. Therefore: $\epsilon>0, \delta_2>0, \forall x: |x-M|<\delta_2 \implies |f(x)-f(M)|<\epsilon/2$ So, for any $x,y \in (M-2\delta_2,M+2\delta_2)$ we have $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$ Now if we set $\delta=\min\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}$ we see that all the $3$ cases above become true and we conclude that $\forall x,y \in [0,\infty): |x-y|<\delta \implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. This proves that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,\infty)$. Is my nonsense considered a proof?",['analysis']

I have been trying to solve an exercise based on the relations and functions. Right now I had stuck to a question based on functions. The question says: A real valued function $f(x)$ satisfies the functional equation $$f(x-y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)-f(a-x)\cdot f(a+y)$$ where $a$ is given constant and also $f(0)=1$ . Then $f(2a-x) =$ ? So far I know in these kind of questions we have to replace a specific variable with another value (maybe any constant or another variable). Like I had done an example previously. Here is an example: Question says, $f(x)+2f(1-x)=x^2$ , Then what is $f(x)$ ? Answer : Given, $$f(x)+2f(1-x)=x^2\text.\tag1\label1$$ Replace $x$ with $1-x$ .
So now equation is $$f(1-x)+2f(x)=(1-x)^2\text.\tag2\label2$$ So after multiplying equation \eqref{2} with $2$ and subtracting equation \eqref{1} we can get the $f(x)$ .

789566,Is convex set in an ordered set necessarily interval or ray? Munkres 16. 7,"The is Problem 7 in Section 16 (page 92) of Munkres' Topology . The problem reads as follows. Let $X$ be an ordered set. If $Y$ is a proper subset of $X$ that is
  convex in $X$, does it follow that $Y$ is an interval or a ray in $X$? The answer is ""No."" This problem has been discussed here in MSE at least twice, see here and here. This post is not a duplicate: I think I came up with another counter-example, and I would like to check whether it is correct or not. (I would be proud if it turned out to be right!) Here it goes: Let $X=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ be equipped with the dictionary order. Consider $Y=\{x\times y: -1\leq x\leq 1\}$. Then $Y$ is convex in $X$, but it
  is not an interval or a ray, as we now prove. If it were an interval,
  it would be of the form $(a\times b, c\times d), (a\times b, c\times
 d], [a\times b, c\times d)$ or $[a\times b, c\times d]$ and none of
  these can be $Y$. Similarly, none of the rays $(a\times b, \infty),
 [a\times b, \infty),  (\infty, a\times b), (\infty,  a\times b]$ can
  possibly equal to $Y$. On the one hand, I think this counter-example works; on the other hand, this means in light of Brian's comment , $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ is not Dedekind complete (at least under dictionary order), which is I guess strange.

789586,Chance of Hamiltonian Path in Sudoku cell,"Checking the correctness of a daily Sudoku I'd just finished, I noticed a curious pattern in one of the 3x3 cells: 1 9 3
8 2 4
7 6 5 Note that each of the numbers is adjacent in the 8 cardinal directions to the number immediately above and below it, so you can traverse them in order without skipping any.  This is certainly not always the case.  Consider: 1 2 3
5 6 4
7 8 9 This has a gap between the 4 and 5, so there's no complete path here.  I made a mental note to check it in subsequent puzzles to see if it happened again - it seems pretty rare.  Even with nine 3x3 grids on each puzzle, once per day for over a month, I've yet to find another.  Also, the original is especially unusual as it creates a Hamiltonian Cycle, not just a Path, as the 1 and the 9 are also adjacent.  This also isn't always true.  Consider: 1 2 3
6 5 4
7 8 9 This has a Hamiltonian Path from 1-9, but not a Cycle because the ends aren't adjacent.  My question is, in a 3x3 grid, how many of the possible (3x3)! permutations result in a Hamiltonian Path, and how many of those are also Hamiltonian Cycles?  Is there a formula for these that can be generalized to 4x4, 5x5, or other NxN grids?  (3x3 is the minimum, as with 2x2, the answer is trivially 100%, since all numbers are adjacent to eachother.) Cycles seem easiest to pin down, at least in 3x3.

9 4 5  │  /─┐    9 7 4  │ /\/
8 7 6  └────┘    8 5 6  │/ /\ which can be rotated and flipped into 8 configurations each, and then for each configuration, the numbers can be cycled into one of 9 positions, or reversed for another 9.

789620,About equivalent norms,"Consider $E$ the space of the functions $f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(0) = 0$ and $f$ satisfies a Lipschitz condition. We define two norms:
$$\|f\| = \sup_{x \in [0,1]} |f(x)|$$ and $$\langle \langle f \rangle \rangle = \sup_{x \in ]0,1]} \frac{|f(x)|}{x}$$ The first part asks to prove that $\langle \langle \cdot \rangle \rangle $ is strictly finer than $\| \cdot \|$. This I managed to do. But I found the second part difficult.
Let $\varphi \in E$, of class $C^1$, such that $\varphi '(0) = 0$.
Let $F \subset E$ the set of functions $f$ such that $|f(x)| \leq |\varphi (x)|  \quad \forall x \in [0, 1]$
We have to prove that the induced metrics on $F$ are equivalent. My attempt : It should suffice to prove that $\langle \langle \cdot \rangle \rangle$ and $\| \cdot \|$ are equivalent. Because of the first part, we only have to find a constant $k$ such that $\langle \langle f \rangle \rangle \leq k \|f\| \quad \forall f \in F$.
By the definition of $\varphi '(0)$, I get $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\varphi (x)}{x} = 0$
Joining this with the condition $|f(x)| \leq |\varphi (x)|$, I got $\lim_{x \to 0} \left|\frac{f(x)}{x}\right| = 0 $ Since $f$ and $\varphi$ satisfy Lipschitz conditions, exists $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)| \leq k_1 |x|$ and $|\varphi (x)| \leq k_2 |x|$, for every $x \in [0,1]$
But I can't join all this information. My intuition says that the constant we're looking for is related to the Lipschitz constant for $\varphi$, since it is fixed.

If we sample i.i.d then it's possible that we substitute $p(x)={1/n} \Sigma^n_{i=1} \delta(x-x_i)$. The function $\delta$ is the delta Kronecker function. Result will be Empirical Risk minimization. i.e. $R(f)={1/n} \Sigma^n_{i=1} l(f(x_i),y_i) $. But if our samples are not i.i.d, then it's not possible to write $p(x)$ as above, so ERM in this simple form is not possible. The problem is what can we can do in the case of non-i.i.d samples. More specifically, if our samples are not independent, what can be done? how to write $p(x)$ similar to the one above that considers the effect of non-i.i.d samples?
If I have any miss-understanding or if I posed the questions wrongly please comment. Also, is there any source or material directly related to this problem in literature.","['statistics', 'sampling', 'probability']"
790053,"Find a complete sufficient statistics, or show that one does not exist","$$  f(x|\theta) = e^{x-\theta}\exp\left(-e^{x-\theta}\right),\;\;\; -\infty < x < \infty,\;\;\; -\infty < \theta < \infty.$$ Find  acompliete sufficient statistics, or show that one does not exists. What I have found was that this given $f$ is not an exponential family, and my solution says as followed; There is no complete sufficient statistics for that. In detail, the solution said the order statistics are minimal sufficient, and this is location family. Thus, the range $R = X_{(n)} - X_{(1)}$ is ancilliary, and expectation does not depend on $\theta$. So this sufficient statistics is not complete. I don't understand two points. First, the solution could be the proof for no-existency of complete statistics, because this is only the proof for the case of $R = X_{(n)} - X_{(1)}$, and second, The fact that the expectation does not depend on $\theta$ could imply that this sufficient statistics is not complete. Could anybody help me to understand this?",['statistics']

790072,10 points inside a square - minimum distance between any of them,"A square of side 1 is given, and 10 points are inside the square. If we divide the square into 9 smaller squares, and apply Dirichlet principle, we can prove that there are 2 of these 10 points whose distance is at most $\sqrt2/3$. Can this statement be improved, in the sense that $\sqrt2/3$ can be replaced with lower value? (This question came to my mind while reading some other similar questions here. I have no idea what would be a good approach.)","['optimization', 'geometry', 'pigeonhole-principle', 'packing-problem']"
790095,Polynomial interpolation using derivatives at some points,"Given $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4), (x_5, y_5)$, we can interpolate a polynomial of degree 4 using Lagrange method. But, when we are given $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4), (x_5, y'''_5)$, how can we interpolate the same degree-4 polynomial? Will Birkhoff interpolation be a good method to solve this or some modified version of Lagrange can be used?","['interpolation', 'derivatives', 'polynomials']"
790101,Why is $\int(1+x^2)^4\mathrm {d}x$ not equal to $\frac{(1+x^2)^{5}}{5(2x)}+C$?,"This is a Rhetorical question since I already know that the answer is because the inner function: $$(1+x^2)$$ is not linear. But what I want to know is a $why$ it must be linear. I have scoured the internet and maths books rigorously looking for an answer to this but no such luck. So if someone could kindly explain to me in simple english (if possible) why it must be linear and why $$\int(1+x^2)^4\mathrm dx$$ is not equal to $$\frac{(1+x^2)^{5}}{5(2x)}+C?$$ Any responses appreciated, Many Thanks. regards, BLAZE.","['calculus', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
