526486,What is meant by 'runs through'?,"I'm independently studying abstract algebra for fun (not my forte...) and I'm reading Herstein.  He has a question in the chapter on rings: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let$$\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{k}=\frac{a}{b}$$ where $a,b\in{\mathbb{Z}}$.  Show $p|a$. (Hint: As $a$ runs through $U_p$, so does $a^{-1}$. $U_p=\{[a]\in\mathbb{Z}_n|(a,n)=1\}$ What does he mean ""run through""?    I've seen this terminology before and it has always perplexed me.  And how does it apply to the proof? I've done it this way for a problem solving class: $$\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\frac{p}{k(p-k)}=p\sum_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\frac{1}{k(p-k)}=\frac{a}{b}$$.","['terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"

526532,"Why is the priemage of a regular value of $F(x,v)=df_x(v)$ finite?","This comes up as part of a larger issue of showing a compact $n$-dimensional manifold can be immersed in $\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$ except at finitely many points. Suppose $X$ is a compact, $n$-dimensional manifold. Let $f\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ be an immersion. Say you have a map $F\colon T(X)\to\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ given by $F(x,v)=df_x(v)$, with a regular value $a$. I'm interested in why the preimage $F^{-1}(a)$ is necessarily finite. After this, I think I have an idea to show $X$ can be immersed into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$ except on $F^{-1}(a)$. So I think it suffices to show that $a$ has only finitely many preimages in $\{(x,v):|v|\leq 1\}$ in the tangent bundle $T(X)$. Towards the contrary, suppose there are infinitely many preimages $(x_i,v_i)$. By compactness, there is a convergent sequence such that $x_i\to x$ and $v_i/|v_i|\to w$. Apparently this implies $df_x(w)=0$, but how does this give a contradiction? By linearity, I find the equation
$$
F(x_i,v_i/|v_i|)=df_{x_i}(v_i/|v_i|)=a/|v_i|
$$
Is the idea that we can without loss of generality assume that $|v_i|\to\infty$, so as $i\to\infty$, $df_x(w)=0$? But why does that show $F^{-1}(a)$ is finite? Thank you.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
526540,Can we turn $\mathbb{R}^n$ into a field by changing the multiplication?,"Of course $\mathbb{R}$ is a field with usual addition and multiplication.  When we move up a dimension into $\mathbb{R}^2$, however, there is not a clear way to multiply two vectors together to get something useful.  In fact, if we define multiplication of two vectors component-wise (as is arguably the most natural way), we get something that isn't even an integral domain.  However, if we implement the multiplication
$$ (a, b)(c, d) \mapsto (ac - bd, ad + bc), $$
then we obtain a copy of $\mathbb{C}$, which is again a field.  Can we do this for higher dimensions? That is, is there some clever multiplicative structure on $\mathbb{R}^3$ that produces a field? $\mathbb{R}^n$?","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

526586,order topology is Hausdorff,"Is it appropriate to ask the community to check my proof?  I am rereading Munkres Topology and trying to do the HW.  This is my attempt for #10 on page 101. Show that every order topology is Hausdorff. Proof: Suppose that $x_1, x_2$ are elements of $X$ , and $x_1 < x_2$ . Case 1: Suppose that $x_2$ is the next element after $x_1$ , and suppose that $$x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3.$$ Then $x_1$ is an element of $(x_0, x_2) = U_1$ .  Then $x_2$ is an element of $(x_1, x_3) = U_2$ . $U_1$ and $U_2$ are disjoint. Case 2: Suppose that there might not be ""next elements"" in $X$ but $x_1 < x_2$ .  Then there exists $$a < x_1 < b < x_2 < c.$$ Then $x_1$ is an element of $(a, b) = U_1$ .  Then $x_2$ is an element of $(b, c) = U_2$ . $U_1$ and $U_2$ are disjoint. Thus $X$ is Hausdorff.

526753,Solving optimization problems using derivatives and critical points,"I have a homework question which I have completed 2/3 of; however I am stuck on the last part of the question. The question is: A drug used to treat cancer is effective at low doses with an efficacy that increases with the quantity of the drug. However, at sufficiently high doses, the drug becomes lethal. For positive values of the constants k_1 and k_2, the fraction of patients surviving cancer with this drug treatment is given by
  $$S(q)=\frac{q^2}{k_1^2+q^2}-\frac{q^2}{k_2^2+q^2}.$$ There are three parts to the question. I have answered the first two parts, but I don't know how to approach the last part, which in this case is question 3. 1) Find $S(0)$ and $\lim_{q\to\infty}S(q)$ and in each case explain what your findings mean in medical terms. For part 1 I made $s(q)$ equal to $0$, which gave me
$$\frac 0 {k_1^2} - \frac 0 {k_2^2} = 0-0 = 0.$$
This indicates that when $q$ is equal to $0$, no patients have survived. I also used the limits for when $q$ is equal to $+\infty$; this gave me $(1-1)$, which is also equal to $0$. Therefore the conclusion here is that when $q$ is very high, hence infinity, the patients will not survive either. 2) What is the optimal daily drug quantity to administer in terms of $k_1$ and $k_2$? For part two, I found the derivative of $s(q)$ and made is equal to $0$. So I found $s'(q)=0$.
This was a very long process which will take me forever to type here, however my final answer here was $q=\sqrt{k_2k_1}$, where $k_2$ and $k_1$ are constants. I am not sure if this is correct, but it looks pretty right to me. 3) Suppose Health Canada has only approved the use of the drug of up to 45 mg/day and suppose $k_1=25 \mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{day}$ is the same for all patients but $k_2$ varies from patient to patient. To determine a personalized treatment strategy it would be useful for physicians to have a plot of the optimal daily drug quantity as a function of $k_2$, call it $q∗(k_2)$. Sketch a plot of $q∗(k_2)$ and explain why you drew it that way. Hint: don't forget that $k_1<k_2$! Tthis is the question that I need help approaching, any one care to help please? Am I meant to find the critical points..? Isn't that what I found in Part two? The graph it? If $k_2$ is meant to be greater than $k_1$ and $k_1$ is 25mg and overall it is 45mg, should $k_2$ be between 0 and 20mg?

The gonality of $C$ is defined as the minimum degree of surjective morphisms $C\rightarrow\Bbb{P}^1$. So $C$ has gonality $d$ if it has a $g^1_d$ but no $g^1_{d-1}$, where $g^r_d$ denotes a linear system of dimension $r$ and degree $d$ on $C$. Now my question is very basic, I don't understand the following remark: If $C$ has gonality $d$ then each $g^1_d$ on $C$ is base point free and complete. First, why are they complete? But even if they are complete, so we have the system $|A|$ with $A$ divisor on $C$, with $\deg A=d\geq2$, and $h^0(A)=2$. Then why is it base point free? Let $P\in C$.

$$h^0(A-P)\geq d-g.$$ Now I'm stuck here. From Hurwitz's formula we get $d=\frac{\deg R}{2}+1-g$, where $R$ is the ramification divisor of the morphism, but I don't see how this may help.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

They usually make the same sorts of arguments, so years ago I wrote up this FAQ to deal with them. Unfortunately, it's still hard to get anywhere with these people; the discussion frequently turns into something of this form: ME: Suppose there is an ordered list containing all the real numbers. Then we can read off the diagonal entries and construct a real number that differs in the Nth decimal place from the Nth real number on the list. This real number obviously cannot be in the list. So the list doesn't contain all the real numbers. THEM: Of course your proposed number is not on the list; it's not a well-defined real number. ME: What do you mean? I gave you the exact procedure for constructing it. You take the Nth real number on the list, and you make it differ from that number in the Nth decimal place. THEM: But if we really have a list of all the real numbers, then your proposed number has to be somewhere in the list, right? ME: Yes, of course, so let's say it's in the 57th place. Then it would have to differ from itself in the 57th place, which is impossible! THEM: Exactly, it's impossible! Your definition requires that it differs in some place from itself, which is impossible, so your definition is bad. ME: But you're only saying that it's impossible on the basis of the assumption that there's a complete list of real numbers, and the whole point is to disprove that assumption. THEM: But we're doing this proof under that assumption, so how can we make a definition that runs contrary to that assumption? ME: But that definition is a good one regardless of whether there are countably or uncountably many reals. It is a complete, algorithmic, unambiguous specification of the real number. What else could you want? THEM: I want the definition to be both unambiguous and non-contradictory, and your definition is contradictory! ME: Forget about the purported complete lists of real numbers for a moment. Don't you agree that for any list of real numbers, complete or incomplete, it's possible to construct a real number that differs in the Nth place from the Nth number on the list? THEM: No, it's only possible to construct such a real number if that real number isn't on the list, otherwise it's a contradictory definition. ME: Don't you see that the contradiction is not the fault of my perfectly good definition, but rather the fault of your assumption that there are countably many real numbers? THEM: No, I don't. ME: But what if we took our putative complete list of real numbers, and fed it in line by line into a computer with an algorithm that spits out, digit by digit, a real number that differs in the Nth digit from the Nth number on the list? Would such a computer program work? THEM: No it wouldn't, the computer program would hit the place on the list where the number being constructed would reside, and then it would get crash, because it can't choose a digit for the number that differs in the nth place from itself.

The case of $k=3$ , I prove as follows: Suppose there are only a finite number of primes $P_k$ so that $3\mid(P_k+P_{k+1})$ . We can conclude there exists the largest prime number $P_m$ so that $3\mid(P_m+P_{m-1})$ and thus, for every prime number $P_n$ where $n>m$ , we know that $P_n+P_{n+1}$ does not divide $3$ . We also know that for every prime number $p$ larger than $3$ we have: $p \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ or $p \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ . According to this we can say for every natural number $n>m$ , we have either $P_n \equiv P_{n+1} \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ or $P_n \equiv P_{n+1} \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ , because otherwise, $3\mid(P_n+P_{n+1})$ which is not true. Now according to Dirichlet's Theorem, we do have infinitely many primes congruent to $2$ or $1$ , mod $3$ . So our case can't be true because of it.

$|\frac 4{(b-a)^2}\int_a^b f(x)dx| =
|\frac 4{(b-a)^2}(F(a)-F(b))|=

527881,Proving completeness of Nikodym Metric,"I'm trying to prove completeness directly of the metric given by $d(A, B) = \mu (A \triangle B)$ on a finite measure space $(X, M, \mu)$. Edit: I should make clear that I'm referring to completeness of the actual Nikodym Metric $M/\sim$ under the relation $A \sim B$ if and only if $\mu(A \triangle B) = 0$. I leave a number of minor details left implicit with respect to this relation (like when I'm talking about a class vs a representative), but they're all rather mundane. Let $M_1, M_2, ...$ be a Cauchy sequence in our metric space. Take a subsequence such that for all $m, p > n$, $d(A_m, A_p) < 1/2^n$, where $A_1, A_2, ...$ denotes our subsequence. Let $A = \limsup M_i$. Then $A$ is also the $\limsup$ of the $A_i$'s, since $x$ belongs to infinitely many sets in one sequence if and only if it belongs to infinitely many in the other. Edit 2: The above bolded argument is erroneous. The $\limsup$ of the $A$'s should differ from the $\limsup$ of the $M$'s only on a set of measure zero, but we may very well lose elements when we pass to a $\limsup$ of the subsequence. Let $n \in N$. We use measure continuity from above on $A \setminus A_n$ and from below on $A_n \setminus A$. \begin{align*}
\mu(A \setminus A_n) &= \mu(( \bigcap_{k \geq 1}^\infty \bigcup_{j=k}^\infty A_j \setminus A_n)) 
\\ &= \mu( \bigcap_{k \geq 1}^\infty \bigcup_{j=k}^\infty (A_j \setminus A_n)) 
\\ &= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \mu(\bigcup_{j=k}^\infty (A_j \setminus A_n))
\end{align*}
At this point I'm stuck - using subadditivity of $\mu$ does not help, as $A_j$ might grow further from $A_n$ as $j \rightarrow \infty$, so that the measure of their difference will grow, making the infinite sum infinite for every $k$. Bounding the other difference is quite simple, however. Using DeMorgan's laws:
\begin{align*}
\mu(A_n \setminus A) &= \mu(A_n \setminus ( \bigcap_{k \geq 1}^\infty \bigcup_{j=k}^\infty A_j))
\\ &= \mu(A_n \cap ( \bigcap_{k \geq 1}^\infty \bigcup_{j=k}^\infty A_j)^c)
\\ &= \mu( \bigcup_{k \geq 1}^\infty \bigcap_{j=k}^\infty (A_n \setminus A_j)) 
\\ &= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \mu(\bigcap_{j=k}^\infty (A_n \setminus A_j))
\\ &< 1/2^n
\end{align*} If we had the same bound on the first difference as well, then we'd have $\mu(A_n \triangle A) = \mu(A_n \setminus A) + \mu(A \setminus A_n) < 1/2^{n-1} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ Which would prove convergence of the subsequence to $A$. But a Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges to the same limit, which would prove the result.","['measure-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences']"
527900,Structure of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^\times$ other than via $p$-adics?,"I think I heard somewhere long ago that $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$'s unit group is cyclic if $p$ is odd and $C_2\times C_{2^{k-2}}$ if $p=2$. I remember trying to prove it and finding it surprisingly difficult. This morning I think I realized you can prove this using the $p$-adic exponential and log maps. Proof sketch below. In a way, this result seems like the $p$-adics would be its natural home, because it's about $\mathbb{Z}$ mod $p^k$ for arbitrary $k$. However, it also seems like exactly the sort of completely classical result that Gauss should have a proof of somewhere. So, my question: How is this usually proven? And, is there a classical, Gauss-typed or at least 19th-century-typed proof? Proof sketch for $p$-adic proof: if $p$ is odd, then $\exp_p$ is a continuous group isomorphism from $(p\mathbb{Z}_p)^+$ to $(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)^\times$. Since $p\mathbb{Z}\subset p\mathbb{Z}_p$ is cyclic and dense, this means that the $1$-units of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ have a dense cyclic subgroup. Reducing mod $p^k$ means that the $1$-units of $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$ are cyclic, since the group is discrete so a dense subset is everything. Now I just have to show that some generating $1$-unit is a $(p-1)$th power in $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$, and this I can do. If $p=2$, then I don't have all the details worked out, but $\log_p$ is $2$-to-$1$ from $1+2\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $2\mathbb{Z}_2$; and I think the preimage of $2\mathbb{Z}$ is dense, whereupon since it is $\{\pm 1\} \times$ cyclic, generated by a lift of $2$, the same argument works (without the shenanigans about the $1$-units, since every unit in $\mathbb{Z}/2^k\mathbb{Z}$ is a $1$-unit).","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'ring-theory', 'finite-rings', 'abstract-algebra']"

My knowledge about algebra is extremely limited, but the only non-UFD integral domain I have seen is $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, where one shows $9=3\cdot 3=(2+\sqrt{-5})(2-\sqrt{-5})$ gives two different factorizations of $9$ into irreducibles with non-associated factors. However in this case the two factorizations are of the same length. So just curious, can we find integral domains where some elements have factorizations into irreducibles with different lengths?

527932,"Analysis of ""Dungeon Raid""","The computer game Dungeon Raid is quite complicated, but for our purposes we can consider the following simplified version. The player has a current health $\def\hcur{h}\hcur$ and a maximum health $\def\hmax{h_{max}}\hmax$ with $0\le\hcur\le\hmax$, and
a current armor $\def\acur{a}\acur$ and a maximum armor $\def\amax{a_{max}}\amax$ with $0\le\acur\le\amax$. The playing field contains groups of monsters, potions, and shields.  On each turn, the player may attack some monsters, gather some potions, or gather some shields. Killing monsters scores points.  Gathering potions raises $\hcur$, possibly all the way to $\hmax$, but no higher.  Similarly, gathering shields raises $\acur$, but not past $\amax$. After the player's turn, any monsters still alive attack the player, doing $d$ points of damage, where $d$ is independent of the other quantities and is calculated in a way that need not concern us. The damage is divided into a portion that is absorbed by the armor, $d_a = \min(\acur, d)$, and the remaining portion that is applied to the player's health, $d_h = d-d_a = \max(d-\acur, 0)$.  The armor is degraded as follows:  $d_a$ fair coins are flipped, and $\acur$ is reduced by one point for each tail. The player's health $\hcur$ is reduced by $d_h$.  If $\hcur$ is now zero or below, the game is over; if $\hcur$ is positive the player gets another turn. At intervals the game will offer the player a choice of equipment upgrades. One such is a health upgrade, which raises both $\hcur$ and $\hmax$ by 5 points; another is an armor upgrade, which raises both $\acur$ and $\amax$ by 1 point. I would like to analyze whether the health or armor upgrade is likely to be better. To this end, I want to engage in intelligent, directed collection of statistics. For example, it seems important to know the distribution of $d_a$ under typical play.  Similarly, it might be useful to know the expected increase to $\acur$ from gathering shields, which depends on how often $\acur$ is close to $\amax$; when $\acur = \amax - 1$ gathering any number of shields can only raise $\acur$ by 1. I don't know what information to collect, how to decide what to collect, or what to do with the information once I have collected it. My question is: On what parameters might the comparison of the armor and health upgrades depend, and what would I need to know in order to compare them?","['statistics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"

In page $64$, he gives the example of limit of the successive powers of $q$. If $-1<q<1$ then the successive powers of $q$ will approach zero as $n$ increases.

\end{array}$$ Then if the numbers are different of $1$ and $0$, I know that these numbers are going to walk . If $n<1$, it's going to walk to the right, and if $n>1$, the number will walk to the left. This looks pretty convincing to me so, why do I need to use Bernoulli's inequality? The answers given by John and RobJohn are useful, they tell me how to do it. But it's not really clear why I should use it instead of the method I just pointed.","['inequality', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'limits']"
