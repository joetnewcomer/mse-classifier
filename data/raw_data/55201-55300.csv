595203,How many Groups there are on a finite set?,"Let say cardinality of set S is $n=|S|$. We know that there are $n^{n^2}$ all binary operations on that set. To find out how many groups can be created by this set and by those operations, we need not only to know how many associative operations there are on that finite set. But also this set and given operation must satisfy specific axioms: closure, associativity, identity and invertibility.

595368,A sequence of random variables that does not converge in probability.,"I was doing a problem about the converge of the sum of random variables which has two parts: Let $X_1, X_2 ,\dots$ be independent and identically distributed random variables with $E X_i = 0$ , $ 0 <\operatorname{Var}(X_i) < \infty $ , and let $S_n = X_1 + \dots+ X_n$ . (a) Use the central limit theorem and Kolmogorov's zero-one law to conclude that $ \limsup S_n / \sqrt{n} = \infty$ almost surely. (b) Use an argument by contradiction to show that $S_n / \sqrt{n}$ does not converge in probability. Hint: Consider $n = m!  $ . I did part (a) but I'm not sure about my proof and people are welcome to go through it: (a) Let $\operatorname{Var} (X_i) = \sigma ^2$ , then by central limit theorem $\frac{S_n} {\sigma \sqrt{n}} \Rightarrow \chi$ where $\chi$ has the standard normal distribution. Therefore for any $x > 0$ , $P( \limsup \frac{S_n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} > x ) \ge P (\chi > x ) > 0$ , thus $P ( \limsup \frac{S_n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} > x) = 1$ for any $x>0$ by Kolmogorov's zero-one law. By monotonicity this implies $ P ( \limsup \frac {S_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \infty) =1 $ , which is $\limsup \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \infty$ a.s. But I stuck with part (b), my approach is the following: (b) Suppose $ \frac{ S_n}{\sqrt{n}}$ converges in probability, then the subsequence $\frac{S_{m!}}{\sqrt{m!}}$ has a further subsequence that converges almost surely. But it doesn't seem to work out well and I don't think I can go on with it. How to prove part (b)? Any idea is appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
595385,How to find probability distribution function given the Moment Generating Function,"After searching, I found two questions like mine, but didn't see my answer to my question. Finding a probability distribution given the moment generating function Finding probability using moment-generating functions My question is how to find any probability distribution function, given its moment generating function. In particular, how to find this from First Principles (and not memorizing a table). Let's try an example: Let $ X \perp Y$.  Define the moment generating functions for $X, Y$
  respectively as $$M_X(t)=\exp(2e^t-2), M_Y(t)=\left(\frac{3}{4}e^t+ \frac{1}{4}\right)^{10}$$ 
  Find $P(X+Y = 2)$. First, the problem doesn't tell us whether the distributions are continuous or discrete, so I assume continuous. Now, how do we solve the following for $f_X(x)$? $$M_X(t)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{xt} f_X(x) \ dx = \exp ( 2\ e^t - 2)\tag{1}$$ Next, can we take the derivative with respect to $x$ to both sides, to bring us closer to the solution $f_X(x)$? I read that a m.g.f. $m_X(t)$ is characteristic to and unique to the  distribution of $X$.

595444,Principal ideal domain is universally catenary ...,"... actually, even more general statement is true: Theorem. Every regular ring is universally catenary .

On the other hand, there should exist an easy proof for Dedekind domains, or at least for principal ideal domains. I only managed to reduce the problem to the following property: Let $A$ be a principal ideal domain  and $B$ a finitely generated over-domain.
  Then the dimension of each fibre over a closed point
  is equal to the dimension of the generic fibre. So in other words
  $$
\dim B\otimes_A A_{(0)}=\dim B\otimes_A k(\mathfrak{p})

595458,Are these definitions of intersection multiplicity equivalent?,"I am pretty sure the answer is yes. I normally work over $\mathbb{C}$ so i will do so here as well, to prevent myself from making silly mistakes. In projective space, one has Serre's famous definition of the intersection multiplicity. If we are dealing with two curves that lie on a surface $C,D \subset S$ there is another definition of intersection multiplicity, see Beauville, complex algebraic surfaces, definition I.2. Given two curves $C, D \subset S \subset \mathbb{P}^n$, one can use both definitions to calculate the intersection multiplicity of the two curves. My question is now: do they always agree? I have the idea that a solution should go somehow like this: A intersection of two such curves is always Cohen Macauly, so we can discard the higher Tor terms in Serre's definition. Then use some commutative algebra to make the two expressions equal. However, i have no idea whether these claims are even true, let alone how to prove them. Especially my commutative algebra is not strong. Even though a full proof would be awesome, i am very much satisfied with a yes or no answer combined with a sketch of a proof. Many thanks! For completeness i state the definitions below: Serre: Let $X$ be a smooth variety and $V, W$ two closed irreducible and reduced subvarieties represented by ideal sheaves $I$ and $J$. The intersection multiplicity on an irreducible component $Z$ of $V\cap W$ is
$$
\mu(Z;V,W)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^i \operatorname{length}_{\mathcal{O}_{X,z}} (\operatorname{Tor}^i_{\mathcal{O}_{Z,z}}(\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/I,\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/J))
$$
where $z$ is the generic point of $Z$. Beauville: Let $C,D$ be two distinct irreducible curves on a smooth surface, $x \in C \cap D$ and $\mathcal{O}_x$ the local ring of $S$ at $x$. Let $f$ resp. $g$ be a local equation for $C$ resp. $D$ in $\mathcal{O}_x$. Then

Let $x_0\in U$, $g(x_0)=c_0$ and let $S = g^{-1}(c_0)$ the level set for $g$ with value $c_0$. Assume $\nabla g(x_0)\ne 0$. If $f\restriction S$ has a maximum or minimum at $x$ then there is a real number $\lambda$ such that $$\nabla f(x_0)=\lambda \nabla g(x_0)$$ Proof The only thing not complete about the sketch of the proof given in Section 7.7 is that we need to know that if $v\perp \nabla g(x_0)$ then $v=c'(0)$ for a $C^1$ curve $c(t)$ in $S$, with $c(0) = x_0$. This can be established as follows. By Theorem 3 there is a change of coordinates $h$ such that $g(h(x_1,\dots,x_n)) = x_n$. Thus $h^{-1} (S)$ is the coordinate plane $x_n = c_0$. Let $w=Dh^{-1}(x_0)\cdot v$. We claim that the last coordinate of $w$ is zero, that is, $w$ lies in the plane $x_n = c_0$. Indeed let $e_n = (0,0,\dots,1)$. We shall show that $\langle w, e_n \rangle = 0$. But from the chain rule, $g(h(x_1,\dots,x_n))=x_n$ implies $$\langle\nabla g(x_0),Dh(y_0) \cdot w\rangle=\langle w,e_n\rangle$$ where $h(y_0)=x_0$. But the left side is $\langle\nabla g(x_0),v\rangle=0$. Now let $c(t)=h(y_0+tw)$. This lies in $S$, $c(0)=x_0$, and from the chain rule, $c'(0)=v$. The proof may now be completed as in the text. $\blacksquare$ Two points that I'm having trouble with: (1) In the seventh line from the last, why does $w$'s last coordinate being zero imply that $w$ lies in the plane $x_n=c_0$?

""Let $P$ be a finite $p$-group for some prime $p$, and let $q$ be a divisor of $|P|$.  Show that $P$ has a normal subgroup of order $q$."" We will use induction on $n$, where $|P|=p^n$.  Clearly the result is true if $|P|=p^1$.  Now assume the statement is true for all groups of order $p^k$ where $k<n$. Since $P$ is a $p$-group it has nontrivial center, and $Z(P)$ is also a $p$-group.  It follows that $P$ has a normal subgroup of order $p$, say $N$.  Form the quotient group $P/N$, which has order $p^{n-1}$, and therefore has a normal subgroup of order $q$ for each divisor $q$ of $p^{n-1}$ by the induction hypothesis. We can show that $P$ has a normal subgroup of index $i$ for $1 \le i \le p^n$.  Clearly this is true for $i=1,p^n$, and $|P:N|=p^{n-1}$.  Consider the canonical homomorphism $\pi:P \to P/N$, which is surjective.  Then by the Correspondence Theorem, $\pi$ and $\pi^{-1}$ are inverse bijections between subgroups of $P/N$ and subgroups of $P$ containing $N$, that respect normality and index.  Then since $P/N$ (by the induction hypothesis) has a normal subgroup of index $p \le i \le p^{n-2}$, so does $P$, and the result follows.

595669,SU(2) Lefschetz decomposition of Jacobian of Riemann surfaces,"Start with a (closed and oriented) Riemann surface with $g$ handles $\Sigma_g.$
I'm interested in (the cohomology of) its Jacobian $Jac(\Sigma_g)=T^{2g},$
in particular how the $SU(2)$ or $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Lefschetz decomposition acts on it. The picture I have in mind is, following Gopakumar-Vafa ideas
(see http://arxiv.org/abs/hep--th/9809187 and http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9812127 )
and Mirror Symmetry book
(by Vafa et al., chapter 33),
that $H^\bullet(T^{2g})$ is a representation of $SU(2),$ precisely it is $I_g=I_1^{\otimes g},$ where $I_1=(1/2)\oplus2(0).$ To see this, start from $g=1,$ i.e. $T^2:$ with a bit of hand-waving, the Jacobian story is equivalent to considering a ground state $| 0 \rangle$ and then act on it with the fermionic operators $\mathrm{d}z$ and $\mathrm{d}\overline{z}$ to get indeed the $I_1$ representation
$$| 0 \rangle, \quad \mathrm{d}z| 0 \rangle, \quad \mathrm{d}\overline{z}| 0 \rangle, \quad \mathrm{d}z\wedge\mathrm{d}\overline{z}| 0 \rangle,$$
i.e. in terms of spin
$$0,\pm \frac12, 0,$$
even if I don't see the precise arrangement or linear combinations involved. A similar story can be repeated for higher $g$ and I guess this matches fine. My QUESTIONS are the following: i. is it possible to actually arrange the various states so obtained in $SU(2)$ multiplets? up to now, I can ony match the number of expected states, which brings me to ii. how is this related to the $SU(2)$ Lefschetz decomposition, which has creation, annihilation and number operators given by
$$ J_+=\omega\wedge, \quad J_-=\omega\lrcorner,\quad J_3=(deg-n)/2,$$
where $\omega$ is the Kahler form of the torus, $deg$ is the bidegree and $n$ the complex dimension?
I would expect a spin $(g/2)$ representation given by
$$(1,\omega,\ldots,\omega^g),$$
which I cannot relate to $I_g.$ My attempt at an ANSWER is that
$$(1,\omega,\ldots,\omega^g)$$
is only the highest spin representation $(g/2)$ inside $H^\bullet(T^{2g}),$
because one can imagine to start, e.g., from $\mathrm{d}z_i$ or $\mathrm{d}z_i\wedge\mathrm{d}z_j$ instead of 1, and then construct a shorter representation, to get that $I_g$ is indeed a sum of irreps. I'd like to know if this reasoning is correct.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds']"

596195,Conceptual reason why a quadratic field has $-1$ as a norm if and only if it is a subfield of a $\mathbb{Z}/4$ extension?,"I have convinced myself in a computation-heavy, ad-hoc way that a quadratic extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ occurs as the unique quadratic subfield of a $\mathbb{Z}/4$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x)=-1$ for some $x\in K$.  (See below for proof sketch.) There must be a more conceptually illuminating proof? Morally / conceptually, why is it that a quadratic field occurs inside a cyclic degree 4 field if and only if -1 occurs in it as a norm? What's the story here? An optimum answer would be a proof that doesn't ask the reader to follow, trust, or replicate any calculations. (As opposed to the following, where I have written ""computation shows"" about 5 times.) Computation-heavy, ad-hoc proof sketch: $\Rightarrow$ If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ with $\alpha^2\in \mathbb{Q}, \alpha\notin\mathbb{Q}$, and $\exists x\in K$ with $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(x)=-1$, we have $x=a+b\alpha$, $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$, with $N(x)=a^2-\alpha^2b^2 = -1$. Let $\beta = \sqrt{\alpha^2b-a\alpha}$ and let $L=K(\beta)$. Then, by computation, $\beta$ satisfies the polynomial
$$f=x^4-2\alpha^2bx^2+\alpha^2\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$$
which is irreducible by Eisenstein, thus $\beta^2$ is not a square in $K$, so $\mathbb{Q}(\beta)=L$ is degree $4$. Let
$$\beta'=(a+b\alpha)\beta\in L$$
Computation shows $\beta'$ also satisfies $f$, so $\beta\mapsto\beta'$ induces an automorphism of $L$; call it $g$. More computation shows $g(\beta')=-\beta$, so $g$ has order $4$, and $\beta$ has 4 conjugates in $L$, thus $L/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois, with $\operatorname{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ generated by $g$. This proves the ""if"" direction. $\Leftarrow$ If $L$ is a $\mathbb{Z}/4$ extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, let $g$ be a generator of its Galois group and let $K$ be the unique quadratic subfield. We can take $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ with $\alpha^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ and $L=K(\beta)$ with $\beta^2\in K$. $1,\alpha,\beta,\alpha\beta$ is a basis for $L/\mathbb{Q}$; we can write a matrix for $g$, seen as a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear transformation, with respect to this basis. We must have $g(1)=1$, and $g(\alpha)=-\alpha$ because $g$ cannot act trivially on $K$. Let $g(\beta)=c+d\alpha+a\beta+b\alpha\beta$ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Q}$. Then, using the fact that $g(\alpha\beta)=g(\alpha)g(\beta)$, the matrix of $g$ is $$\begin{pmatrix}1& &c&-\alpha^2d\\ &-1&d&-c\\ & &a&-\alpha^2b\\ & &b&-a\end{pmatrix}$$ Also, $g^2(\alpha)=\alpha$ because $K$ is fixed by $g^2$, and $g^2(\beta)=-\beta$ because $-\beta$ is $\beta$'s only conjugate over $K$ and $L$ is not fixed by $g^2$. Thus the matrix of $g^2$ is $$\begin{pmatrix}1& & & \\ &1& & \\ & &-1& \\ & & &-1\end{pmatrix}$$ It follows by computation that $a^2-\alpha^2b^2=-1$. (It also follows that $c=d=0$, but this isn't needed.) Thus $a+b\alpha\in K$ has norm $-1$. This proves the ""only if"" direction.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'soft-question', 'galois-theory', 'field-theory']"

The most statistics I ever took was a few lessons on it back in high school. What always bothered me is how arbitrary the definitions seemed. For instance, I remember having trouble with the definition of standard deviation. The standard deviation of a set of values $X$ is the square root of the average of the squared of the differences between each value in $X$ and the average of $X$. At school, standard deviation was never given any more precise definition than ""a number that gives you a rough idea how 'diffuse' the dataset is"". While I can see in a very approximate way that this is basically correct, it's a long way from how definitions of concepts in math are usually explained. Usually there's a precise notion that we're trying to capture, and a clear explanation as to how our definition captures that notion. But here, when I asked for further information, I was told things like ""you square the differences to make them positive"", when what I was hoping for was something like: A specific real-world concept that the definition captures. A class of problems in which the definition arises naturally. A specific mathematical property that we would like to have, which leads necessarily to this particular definition. Is there any rigorous basis for the definitions in statistics, or do we genuinely just make up formulae that kinda sorta get us something like what we're trying to calculate?

However, it seems like no matter how I constructed a set of positive measure, there is a region that have a lot of point in it (yet this region is not necessarily dense). This suggest that when summed up, the holes should be covered up somehow and thus there would be an open interval, and so the answer is yes. Sorry for a rather vague idea, but I'm just not sure what to do with this problem. I have a feeling that somehow topology would have a way to capture precisely the idea above about a region with a lot of point. (also, I think my middle school teacher mentioned this once, and I remembered the answer to be yes; but that is quite a while ago though) Thank you. Any help will be appreciated. EDIT2: So Camilo's answer is gone. I am looking at the convolution method right now. Because the convolution is continuous, if it is nonzero I am done. But then there is no guarantee that the convolution is nonzero even if $x\in A+B$. I still need help with this direction. Can someone give me some hints? EDIT: Camilo's answer below essentially suggest the method of getting 2 open interval from regularity theorem, one cover a subset of A and one cover a subset of B such that the sum of the measure of these two subset is bigger than the measure of the larger interval. user99680's answer point to a wiki which show a method that essentially simply acquire an open set. After some thinking, I believe that these method simply can't be made to work. I constructed this example in the hope that it would convince you that it is the case: Let $I_{0},I_{1},\ldots$ be disjoint open interval such that the distance between any 2 of them is nonzero and $m(I_{n})=9^{-n}$ and all of them are inside $[0,2]$. Let $J_{0},J_{1},\ldots$ be disjoint open interval such that the distance between any 2 of them is at least $3$ and $m(J_{3n})=m(J_{3n+1})=m(J_{3n+2})=\frac{m(I_{n})}{3}$. Let $O=\bigcup I_{n}$ and $H=\bigcup J_{n}$. Construct $A\subset O$ such that $m(A\bigcap I_{n})=\frac{3m(I_{n})}{4}$. Construct $B\subset H$ such that $m(B\bigcap J_{n})=\frac{3m(J_{n})}{4}$. Now if you apply Camilo's method, it is possible that your $I$ would be one of the $I_{n}$ above, and your $J$ is one of the $J_{m}$ above. No matter which $I_{n},J_{m}$ you have, the argument does not work. Rewrite $m=3q+r$ where $0\leq r\leq 2$. If $q<n$ then $m(J_{m})>m(I_{n})$ so the longer interval have length $\frac{m(I_{q})}{3}$; $m(A\bigcap I_{n})$ is at most $\frac{3m(I_{q+1})}{4}=\frac{m(I_{q})}{12}$ and $m(B\bigcap J_{m})=\frac{3m(J_{m})}{4}=\frac{m(I_{q})}{4}$. Thus $m(A\bigcap I_{n})+m(B\bigcap J_{m})$ is no larger than the larger interval. If $n\geq q$ then $m(I_{n})>m(J_{m})$ so the larger interval is of length $m(I_{n})$; $m(A\bigcap I_{n})=\frac{3m(I_{n})}{4}$ and $m(B\bigcap J_{m})$ is at most $\frac{3m(J_{3n})}{4}=\frac{m(I_{n})}{4}$. Once again $m(A\bigcap I_{n})+m(B\bigcap J_{m})$ is no larger than the larger interval. Hence the Camilo's argument does not work. user99680's method does not work either, since you get $O$ and $H$ which is even bigger than any interval.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
596289,Volume of ellipsoid bounded by two planes.,"I need to find the volume of ellipsoid: $$5x^2 + {y^2\over25} + {3z^2\over4} = 1$$
if the ellipsoid is bounded by $z={-1\over2}$ and $z=1$ planes. I was able to find the total volume of the ellipsoid using the formula $V={4\pi\over3}*abc={40\pi\over3\sqrt15}$. But I don't think i can use this in any way to find the volume of the ellipsoid that is bounded by 2 planes. To find the actual volume, I'm pretty sure I need to solve this: $V=\int_{-1\over2}^1S(x)dx$, where $S(x)$ is the area of the cross section of the ellipsoid, which is an ellipse.

596331,$\mathbb Q$ is not the direct product of two non-trivial groups.,"I know this has been asked before, in a bunch of places, so I expect it to be closed as a duplicate at some point, but I'd like to know if my own proof works. If the proof is incorrect, please limit answers to pointing out the errors. If the proof is correct, then thoughts on improving it would be appreciated. Prove that $\Bbb Q$ is not the direct product of two non-trivial groups. —Aluffi exercise II.3.5. My proof Suppose that $\Bbb Q = G \times H$ , neither $G$ nor $H$ trivial. First note that $0_G$ is the only element of $G$ with finite order: If $m\ne 0$ and $m\cdot g=0_G$ , then $m\cdot(g,0_H)=0_{G\times H}$ , contradicting the fact that $\Bbb Q$ has no non-zero elements of finite order. Suppose that for some $m\ne 0$ and some $n\ne 0$ , $\pi_G(m/n)=0_G$ . Then $0_G=n\cdot\pi_G\left(\frac m n\right)=\pi_G\left(n\cdot\frac m n\right)=\pi_G(m)=m\cdot\pi_G(1)$ . Since $\pi_G(1)$ has finite order, we conclude that $\pi_G(1)=0$ . Since $\Bbb Z=\langle 1\rangle$ , $\pi_G$ maps every integer to $0_G$ . Now let $a$ and $b$ be non-zero integers. Then $b\cdot\pi_G\left(\frac a b\right)=\pi_G\left(b\cdot \frac a b\right)=\pi_G(a)=0_G$ . As above, this shows that $\pi_G\left(\frac a b\right)=0_G$ . Thus if $\pi_G$ is not an injective function, then it must map everything to $0_G$ , so $G$ will be a trivial group. The same result holds for $\pi_H$ . Since by assumption, $G$ and $H$ are non-trivial, $\pi_G$ and $\pi_H$ are both injective functions, which is of course impossible.",['group-theory']
596332,Confused about differentiability/continuity/partial derivative existence,"Ok, so in my notes it says Prop 1: If a function is differentiable, it will be continuous AND it will also have partial derivatives. Prop 2: If a function is continuous, or has partial derivatives, or has both, it does not guarantee the function is differentiable. And the example to follow for prop 2 is:
$f(x,y)=\frac{y^3}{x^2+y^2}$ if $(x,y )\ne (0,0)$ $f(x,y)=0 $ if $(x,y)=(0,0)$ $f_x(0,0)=0$ $f_y(0,0)=1$ (how????) The function is also continuous at $(0,0)$ since $\lim f(x,y)=0$ (using squeeze theorem) So it says the partial derivatives exist. My first question is, why is $f_y(0,0)=1$? shouldn't it be $0$? Not that it makes a difference. The partials will exist regardless. My second question is, it says that this function is not differentiable. How do they know that? My third question: It says in the calculus textbook, one of the theorems (theorem 8 of chapter 14.4 for stewert's book): If the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist near $(a,b)$ and are continuous at $(a,b)$ then $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$.

596347,Is π unusually close to 7920/2521?,"EDIT: One can look at a particular type of approximation to $\pi$ based on comparing radians to degrees.  If you try to approximate $\pi$ by fractions of the form $180n/(360k+1)$, you can find that $\pi \approx \frac{7920}{2521}$.  And this is pretty close: the continued fraction expansion of $\pi$ is $(3; 7,15,1,292,\ldots)$, and the continued fraction for the approximation is $(3;7,16,4,2,2)$. However, if you switched out 360 for dividing the circle into $r$ pieces, you are looking for approximations of $\pi$ of the form $rn / 2(rk+1)$ as $n$ and $k$ vary. Is this particular approximation for $\pi$ you get, based on 360 degrees, unusually close for the size ($n=44$, $k=7$) present? I feel like I have to tell a story to justify this question, because otherwise it's a little weird -- please bear with me. Some time (a long time) ago, I was in a programming class for grade-school kids and we were learning to do some basic graphics.  We were drawing fireworks, and encountered the problem that the ""bursts"" seemed to have their points going off in random directions.  You can guess why: the standard library functions for sin and cos were expecting radians instead of degrees. Our teacher told us that there was some conversion factor, but didn't remember it.  So I set the computer on a loop to draw lines out from the center of a circle, to see if I could figure out what the conversion factor was.  It animated drawing lines at angles of 1 radian, 2 radians, 3 radians, ... 360 radians, and then cleared the screen and started over drawing lines at 2 radians, 4 radians, 6 radians ... and then again drawing at 3 radians, 6 radians, 9 radians, ... Of course, this was kind of misguided, but it was interesting to watch for a few minutes.  (If I was more motivated, I would try and animate it again, but those skills are very rusty.)  And then, at the multiples of 44 radians, it suddenly worked: it visibly drew a nice, sweeping path all the way around the circle in one pass. I tweaked around with it a little and found that while (cos(360*44),sin(360*44)) were pretty close to (1,0), a better approximation was had if you used about 43.99975 instead.  I still remember this number all this time later. Now I know radians a little better, and abstractly know that this is because $2\pi(7 + \tfrac{1}{360})$ is very close to the integer 44.  Another way to say this is by trying to find approximations as I stated above.  As I learned more math I understood this less and less, because the answer seems much closer than it deserves to be based on how small the numbers in question are.","['pi', 'trigonometry', 'continued-fractions', 'diophantine-approximation']"

[duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Proof that all abelian simple groups are cyclic groups of prime order (5 answers) Closed 8 years ago . So I'm having trouble with this problem. I know that the definition of a simple group means that the group has no nontrivial subgroups. I know that this can be proven somehow with the help of the converse of Lagrange's Theorem for Abelian groups: If G is abelian of order n, and d is a divisor of n, then G has a subgroup of order d. My attempt:
(=>)Assume that G is a finite abelian group and is simple, then G has no nontrivial normal 
subgroups. 
(Now I don't know how to show that this implies that G has order p, where p is prime. (<=)Assume that G is a finite abelian group with order p, where p is a prime. (Since the order of p is prime then what does this mean?) Edit: Can someone check my new attempt at the proof? (=>) Suppose G is a simple finite abelian group. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that G does not have prime order, then |G|=p*k where p is a prime number and k is an integer such that k>1. Then G has an element of order p. Let the element of order p be called x. Then , the subgroup generated by x, is of order p and  is not all of G. Since G is abelian, this subgroup is normal, which leads us to a contradiction. Therefore, G must have prime order. (<=) Suppose that G is a finite abelian group and it’s order is p, a prime. Since G has prime order, then the only two subgroups of G are the trivial subgroup and the group G. Then, by definition the group G is simple since there are no nontrivial proper subgroups, and thus no nontrivial normal subgroups.","['abelian-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'proof-verification', 'group-theory']"

MY TRY: We once again utilize the following facts: (i)If there are 3 number of boys in the class,then number of girls also has to be 3.
(ii)If there are 4 boys,required number of girls is also 4. So if we can rewrite $r$ in the form $3k+4z$,we are done. Lemma: Every integer $r\ge 3$ except 5 can be written in the form $3k+4z$ [k and z are positive integers,not both of them $0$] PROOF: A number greater than or equal to 3 is of the form $3p$,$3p+1$,$3p+2$ for some positive integer p.We treat the cases individually[we must note that 5 cannot be expressed as a sum of multiples of 3 and 4.For this,we consider $p\ge 2$. So,we consider the cases r=3,4,5 separately and see that the number of boys and girls are indeed equal]. $3p$: If r=3p for some positive integer p,then plugging k=p and z=0 gives us 3p=3(p)+4(0) and we are done. $3p+1$: Plugging k=p-1 and z=1, we get 3(p-1)+4=3p+1 $3p+2$: Plugging k=p-2 and z=2,we get 3(p-2)+4(2)=3p+2 and the proof is complete. Since r can always be written in the form $3k+4z$, (1)Number of girls needed for 3k number of boys is 3k[From (i)]. (2)Number of girls needed for 4z number of boys is 4z[From (ii)]. Therefore total number of girls=3k+4z=r and we are done.Am I correct?","['elementary-number-theory', 'contest-math', 'combinatorics']"
596622,Isomorphism of sheaves [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Failure of isomorphisms on stalks to arise from an isomorphism of sheaves (5 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Let $X$ be a scheme and $\mathscr{F}$, $\mathscr{G}$ sheaves on $X$. Suppose we know that for every $x\in X$ the stalks are isomorphic:
$$ \mathscr{F}_x \cong \mathscr{G}_x $$ Can we conclude immediately from here that $\mathscr{F}\cong \mathscr{G}$, or do we first need to find a morphism of sheaves $f:\mathscr{F}\to \mathscr{G}$ such that $f_x$ induces the above isomorphisms on the stalks for every $x$ ? Remark: Proposition 1.1 (page 63) of Hartshorne says that: A morphism of sheaves $f : \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G}$ on a
  topological space $X$ is an isomorphism iff the induced map on stalks
  $f_x : \mathscr{F}_x \to \mathscr{G}_x$ is an isomorphism for every
  $x\in X$. Extra question: What can we say, instead, if we have isomorphisms between every fiber of $\mathscr{F}$ and $\mathscr{G}$ ?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
596625,"Only one critical point, local minimum but not global","Given a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which has only one critical point and it's a local minimum, for what $n$ is it a global minimum? For a convex function with one variable a local minimum is always global. For functions with two variables, it's not true. There are many counterexamples: $f(x,y) = e^{3x} + y^3-3ye^x$. Here the only solution of  $f_x=3e^{3x}-3ye^x=0$, and $f_y=3y^2-3e^x=0$ is $(0,1)$ which is a local minimum by the second derivative test. But $f(0,-3)=-17<f(0,1)=-1$ $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2(1+x)^3$ has the same property. What about higher dimensions? Could you help me determine the condition on $n$ for which the only local minimum is global? Thank you.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"
596634,Mean Value Theorem: $\frac{2}{\pi}<\frac{\sin x}{x}<1$,"I need to show that $\dfrac{2}{\pi}<\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}<1$ for $0<x<\dfrac{\pi}{2}$. I know I need to use the mean value theorem, would I just say that since $f$ is continuous in the interval (call it I). We know $\exists c\in I$ such that $f'(c) = \dfrac{f\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)-f(0)}{\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$. I don't know where this is going though. Also, would I need to show $\lim_{x \to 0}\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$? Is there a way to do this without L'H Rule?","['inequality', 'trigonometry', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
