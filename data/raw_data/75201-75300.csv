935228,How to master general topology for analysis?,"I started learning topology long ago. I first exposed myself to metric topology in Baby Rudin and Munkres Topology 2nd ed. Part I. Munkres is my most revisited book ever since. The first big challenge I faced is when approaching William Boothby's An Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry . I soon realized that I needed to learn some algebraic topology and differential topology, which I did much later. Nevertheless, everyday topology for me is still mostly general topology. I could say every bits and pieces of Munkres's Part I has its use in analysis, but hell, its really a lot to memorize. I read the book through, or some chapters again and again. But somehow I still cannot memorize everything. So as a result, I had to come back to Munkres from time to time, the only difference being now I know what I am looking for. But I definitely cannot say I learn topology very well. This has puzzled me for a long time, because usually after I read a book three times, I can have a good feeling of at least the big picture. But with Munkres, its just less organized in my mind, not the big blocks (connected/ compactness/ countability/ separation/ compactification/ metrization/ completeness/ Baire space), but those small yet useful lemma/theorems/corollaries. So, my question is: how to organize the huge body of general topology in one's mind for analysis's purpose (real/complex/functional/harmonic...on Euclidean space/manifold/Lie group)?","['general-topology', 'soft-question', 'analysis']"

935234,Monte Carlo p-test and early stopping,"Say you have a coin with some probability $p$ of falling on heads.  You would like to determine if this probability is less than or equal to $0.05$ with some reasonable degree of confidence and stop as soon as you have that confidence. This is meant to be a model for doing any Monte Carlo statistical test where you would like to reject with a $p$-value of $0.05$ or lower and where tests are expensive so you want to stop as early as possible. What is known about the earliest time you can stop, depending on the
  outcome of the coin tosses and your desired degree of confidence?","['statistics', 'reference-request', 'probability']"

  However, if you perform the action of crossing the street 1000 times, then your chance of being hit by a bus increases to about 60% because every time you do the action, the probability of it happening again increases.

935257,$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable?,"Until this morning I was pretty sure that the answer was yes. It should have the same cardinality of $\mathbb{Q}$, which is countable. Besides the cartesian product of countable set should be countable ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set ). Yet this morning a professor of mine told me that it is not and gave me this proof: It is clear that $\mathbb{N} \times \{0,1\} \subset \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$. Now, an element of $\mathbb{N} \times \{0,1\}$ can be seen as a succession $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $x_n$ can be $0$ or $1$. I.e. if we consider $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ the binary representation of the decimal part of a real number, then $\mathbb{N} \times \{0,1\}$ should be the set of all real numbers between $0$ and $1$, i.e. $[0,1]$, which is uncountable. So also $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$. I feel a bit confused as I don't see any error in my professor's proof, yet I don't see how can this be coherent with the countability of the cartesian product of countable sets.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

935307,Find a smooth function with prescribed moments,"In several contexts I’ve encountered variants of the following problem :
let $m_0,m_1,m_2$ be real numbers such that $0 < m_1 < m_0$ and
$\frac{m_1^2}{m_0} <m_2 < m_1$. Then, show that there is a nonnegative smooth
function $f : [0,1] \to {\mathbb R}^{+}$ such that $$
\int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx=m_0, \ 
\int_{0}^{1} xf(x)dx=m_1, \
\int_{0}^{1} x^2f(x)dx=m_2.
$$ The easiest version is when ""smooth"" means just ""piecewise continuous"" ; in that case
the only proof I know uses staged functions with complicated parameters. Is there
a proof that avoids such tedious computations ? I guess that one can always find a ${\cal C}^{\infty}$ solution $f$, and even
an analytic one, but I have no clear idea on how to proceed. My (very vague) thoughts : Bump functions ?
Integration by parts, transforming the problem into an easier interpolation problem ? EDIT (09/24/2014) : In answer to Han de Bruijn’s comment, if one works on a general $[a,b]$ instead of $[0,1]$, so that $m_k=\int_a^b x^k f(x)dx$, then the inequalities
become $$
am_0 < m_1 < bm_0, \ \frac{m_1^2}{m_0} < m_2 < (a+b)m_1-abm_0
$$ Note that the inequation $\frac{m_1^2}{m_0} < m_2$ (which remarkably
contains no $a$ or $b$) comes from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.","['interpolation', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

935320,What is the bound on $E\|Y_n\|^4$ in terms of $n$?,"Let $X_n,n\in\mathbb{N}$ be i.i.d. zero-mean random variables in some separable Hilbert space with $E\|X_n\|^8<\infty$ and $Y_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_n$. I need to find bounds on $E\|Y_n\|^4$. The CLT tells me that $Y_n = O_p(n^{-1/2})$. Can I say something about $E\|Y_n\|^4$ ? As I understand, $\|\sqrt{n}Y_n\|^4\xrightarrow{d}\|G\|^4$, where $G$ is some Gaussian process, so that $\|Y_n\|^4 = O_p(n^{-2})$, but I don't see how do deal with expected value of something bounded in probability. Update: I did the following computations
$$\begin{aligned}
E\|Y_n\|^4 & = \frac{1}{n^4}E\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\langle X_i,X_j\rangle\right)^2 \\

For example, if $i\ne j\ne k\ne l$, $E[\langle X_i,X_j\rangle\langle X_k,X_l\rangle] = E[\langle X_i,X_j\rangle]E[\langle X_k,X_l\rangle]=0$ due to independence.

935325,How to compute associative binary operation on a finite set based on partial information?,"I am working on a problem, and I must be staring at the answer without seeing it since it's among the introductory problems in my abstract algebra textbook. We're told that an associative binary operation $*$ has been defined on a finite set $\{w,x,y,z\}$. Then we are given an incomplete table that defines this operation, set up as follows:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
*&w & x & y & z \\
\hline w & w & x & y & z\\
\hline x & x & w & y & z\\
\hline y & y & z & y & z\\
\hline z
\end{array}
$$ The results in the table correspond to the binary operation acting on the ordered pair consisting of the element of the row, then the element of the column. For example, the item in the third row and first column represents $y*w$. The first three rows of the table have been filled in, and I am asked to fill in the fourth row; namely, I must compute $z*w,z*x,z*y,$ and $z*z.$ Clearly the fact that the operation is associative must be enough to do this, but I am not seeing how. For example, if I try to compute $z*w,$ I could use substitution to write this as $z*w = z*(x*x) = (z*x)*x$, but I do not see how this helps me since I do not know the value of $z*x$.","['binary-operations', 'elementary-set-theory']"
935344,There is no smallest infinity in calculus?,"Somewhat of a basic question, but I tried mixing set theory and calculus and the result is a giant mess. From set theory (assume ZFC) we know there is a smallest infinite cardinal, $\aleph_0$ , and that infinite numbers are well ordered, $\aleph_1 > \aleph_0$ etc Now if we move to the world of calculus, even there, there is a difference between one infinity and the other. $\lim_{x \to \infty} x = \infty$ , and $\lim_{x \to \infty} e^x = \infty$ , but they are not the same, you could say that the $e^x$ one is bigger, because $\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{e^x}{x} = \infty$ as can be shown easily with L'Hôpital's rule. This leads me to believe that unlike in set theory, in calculus there is no smallest infinity, since if $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)= \infty$ , then $\lim_{x \to \infty} \log (f(x) = \infty$ but a smaller $\infty$ . So which version is ""correct""? Is there really a smallest infinity like in set theory? or we can keep getting smaller and smaller to no end like in calculus? Or both are correct in different context? I'm a bit confused. Which also leads to another question, when we say in calculus that some limit tends to $\infty$ , which $\infty$ are we talking about? $\aleph_2$ ? $\aleph_0$ ?","['calculus', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'infinity', 'limits']"

I wonder if it's possible to simplify this expression somehow, e.g. to combine some trilogarithm terms to express them using logarithms, or at least to reduce the number of terms?

935409,Confusion regarding Riemann normal coordinates,"I'm trying to understand Riemann normal coordinates. This ""simple"" example using the surface of a unit sphere is from http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~macpd/gen_rel/snotes.pdf (p26). The “north pole” $\theta=0$ is the initial point. The geodesics radiating from the north pole are lines of constant $\phi$. The new coordinates $\xi$ and $\eta$ are related to the old (ordinary spherical) coordinates by $$\xi=\theta\cos\phi$$ and$$\eta=\theta\sin\phi.$$ I'm assuming (quite possibly incorrectly) that these are arbitrary definitions. They then say the metric is$$ds^{2}=d\theta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2}$$
 $$=\frac{d\xi^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\xi^{2}\theta^{2}+\eta^{2}\sin^{2}\theta\right)+\frac{d\eta^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\eta^{2}\theta^{2}+\xi^{2}\sin^{2}\theta\right)$$
 where $\theta=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\eta^{2}}.$ Can anyone please explain where the second metric comes from and also why $\theta=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\eta^{2}}$? Thank you. This edit added 18 Sept 2014 Right, I'm going to wander off on my own with this and see where I get. Substituting $\eta$ and $\xi$ into the metric gives $$ds^{2}=\frac{d\xi^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\xi^{2}\theta^{2}+\theta^{2}\sin^{2}\phi\sin^{2}\theta\right)+\frac{d\eta^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\eta^{2}\theta^{2}+\theta^{2}\cos^{2}\phi\sin^{2}\theta\right).$$ Note that for a unit sphere (with the $x,y$ plane passing through the equator) $$x=\sin\theta\cos\phi,$$ $$y=\sin\theta\sin\phi.$$
  This gives$$ds^{2}=\frac{d\xi^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\xi^{2}\theta^{2}+\theta^{2}y^{2}\right)+\frac{d\eta^{2}}{\theta^{4}}\left(\eta^{2}\theta^{2}+\theta^{2}x^{2}\right)$$ $$ds^{2}=\frac{d\xi^{2}}{\theta^{2}}\left(\xi^{2}+y^{2}\right)+\frac{d\eta^{2}}{\theta^{2}}\left(\eta^{2}+x^{2}\right)$$
 $$ds^{2}=d\xi^{2}\frac{\left(\xi^{2}+y^{2}\right)}{\left(\xi^{2}+\eta^{2}\right)}+d\eta^{2}\frac{\left(\eta^{2}+x^{2}\right)}{\left(\xi^{2}+\eta^{2}\right)}.$$
 And then I grind to a halt. The metric is supposed to reduce to $\delta_{\alpha\beta}$, but I can't see how it does. Just a thought, but is it useful to point out that for small angles (where $\theta=\sin\theta)$, $\eta\approx y$ and $\xi\approx x$? The above metric then reduces to $$ds^{2}\approx d\xi^{2}+d\eta^{2}.$$ Is this what should happen for Riemann normal coordinates? This edit added 21 September 2014 Following the latest hint from @Semsen
$$ds^{2}=\frac{\zeta^{2}}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\zeta^{2}+\frac{2\eta\zeta}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\zeta d\eta+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\eta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta\cos^{4}\phi\{\frac{1}{\zeta^{2}}d\eta^{2}-2\frac{\eta}{\zeta^{3}}d\eta d\zeta+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\zeta^{4}}d\zeta^{2}\}$$ $$ds^{2}=\frac{\zeta^{2}}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\zeta^{2}+\frac{2\eta\zeta}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\zeta d\eta+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\zeta^{2}+\eta^{2}}d\eta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta\frac{\zeta^{4}}{\theta^{4}}\{\frac{1}{\zeta^{2}}d\eta^{2}-2\frac{\eta}{\zeta^{3}}d\eta d\zeta+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\zeta^{4}}d\zeta^{2}\}$$ $$ds^{2}=\frac{\zeta^{2}}{\theta^{2}}d\zeta^{2}+\frac{2\eta\zeta}{\theta^{2}}d\zeta d\eta+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\theta^{2}}d\eta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta\frac{1}{\theta^{4}}\{\zeta^{2}d\eta^{2}-2\eta\zeta d\eta d\zeta+\eta^{2}d\zeta^{2}\}$$

935459,At most $n$ functions satisfy $f(x)=\bigl(x-f(a_1)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(a_2)\bigr)\dots\bigl(x-f(a_n)\bigr)$?,"Some background: I was trying to solve the functional equation $f\bigl(f(x)\bigr)=\sin x$ . I realized that $f(\pi n)$ is a root of $f$ for all integers $n$ , because $f\bigl(f(\pi n)\bigr)=\sin(\pi n)=0$ . Thus, we can write $f$ as $f(x)=A\bigl(x-f(0)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(\pi)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(-\pi)\bigr)\dots$ . The problem now is to find all functions $f$ that solve this. I couldn't even begin on this, so I decided to try letting the constant $A$ equal $1$ , and to try some simpler versions first. E.g. For $f(x)=x-f(0)$ we find the unique solution $f(x)=x$ ; for $f(x)=\bigl(x-f(0)\bigr)\Bigl(x-f\left(\sqrt{2}\right)\Bigr)$ we find two solutions, namely $f(x)\in \left\{x^2-1,x^2-2\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)x\right\}$ . I solved many more examples, and then conjectured that: Let $a_i\in \mathbb{C}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$ . Prove that the functional equation $f(x)=\bigl(x-f(a_1)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(a_2)\bigr)\dots\bigl(x-f(a_n)\bigr)$ has exactly $n$ distinct solutions. Finally, I realized that if this is proved, then it would ""follow"" (I don't know if this is rigorous but I hope someone knows how to make it rigorous) that our original functional equation $f(x)=\bigl(x-f(0)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(\pi)\bigr)\bigl(x-f(-\pi)\bigr)\dots$ (I put $A=1$ ) has infinitely many solutions.

I wondered what would happen to this probability if I stopped trying to cross the road as soon as I get hit. Does the probability change? As far as I can figure it, the probability then just becomes the sum of the geometric series $$P(\text{hit by bus within 1000 crossings}) = \sum_{n=0}^{999} 1/1000 * (999/1000)^n$$ thus $$
P(\text{hit by bus within 1000 crossings}) = 1/1000 * \frac{1-(999/1000)^{1000}}{1-999/1000}
$$ However, this is identical to $$P(\text{hit by bus within 1000 crossings}) = 1-P(\text{not hit by bus within 1000 crossing}) = 1-(999/1000)^{1000}$$ which is the answer to the previous question.

935598,"What to do when regular approaches fail on linear, non-homogeneous ODES.","In my research problem, I have come across the following form of a time varying, non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. $$\dot x + \frac{k_1}{t} x = k_2t^{3n}\sin(bt) + k_3 t^n \sin(bt) - k_4 t^{3n} \cos(bt) + k_5 t^{n} \cos(bt)$$ where the $k_i$'s are constants. I found in a book by Henry D'Angelo that as long as the time-varying coefficient is continuous (which it is in the interval that I'm examining said system), a solution exists for this system. I used Mathematica to compute an analytical solution which it does fairly rapidly but the solution involves incomplete gamma functions. If the second term didn't exist i.e. $\frac{k_1}{t} x$, then I can see where the incomplete gamma integral might come from. I do not, however understand how Mathematica constructed the analytical solution. I have tested the analytical result versus numerical results and they seem to behave identically which tests the validity of the analytical result (am I wrong in assuming this?). If anyone can share some input on how one goes about attempting to generate solutions for such a system, I'd be much in gratitude as one can't use traditional approaches to determine $x(t)$.

This was of course a mistake: indeed, for $n=4$ or $5$ cities, forcing the nearest-neighbor to produce a bad route, one also forces, in parallel, an equally bad route for the furthest-neighbour strategy. Things get complicated and fiddly for $n>5$, so I am thinking this is not a good approach, which brings me back to square one: Question Is it possible to construct a weighted graph such that, given a starting city, choosing the furthest away city at each stage yields a shorter route than picking the closest?","['graph-theory', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

935739,Circle rotating within a circle (roulette),"This was something in a course of mine I'm a bit too thick to see. If one takes a circle of radius $3$ and a circle of radius $1$, and rolls the smaller circle smoothly inside the larger one until the point $P$ which starts out in contact with the larger circle is in the same place, how can one prove that the smaller circle goes through exactly two rotations? The curve generated by the path of the vector $\mathbf{P}$ (the vector from the center of the larger circle to $P$) is called a roulette - more specifically, a deltoid. If you trust the picture, then you can see that the smaller circle does go through two rotations: letting $\mathbf{C}$ be the center of the smaller circle, the little vector pointing from $\mathbf{C}$ to $\mathbf{P}$ rotates around to pointing due right exactly twice, so the circle rotates twice also. But I don't know how to prove this. This question came up because we wanted to find the parametric equation of $\mathbf{P}$. It'll be the sum of the vectors $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{P- C}$; the first one has equation $(2\cos(t), 2\sin(t))$, and if the smaller circle rotates around (clockwise) exactly two times, it'll have the equation $(\cos(2t), -\sin(2t))$. This would give the parametrization of the curve immediately. But how to prove that ?

So then I simply put in $1272.816$ as $T(n)$ and $2$ for $b$ and solved for $a$: \begin{align*}

The white dots are the points, the red is the sphere, the black circle is the circle in the plane, the green is the elliptical cone enclosing the points: Why not Point-rejection? To generate random points uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere, this works (pseudo Matlab code; where $n$ is the number of the points): z = rand(n)*2-1
θ = rand(n)*2π
x = sqrt(1. - z.*z).*cos(θ)
y = sqrt(1. - z.*z).*sin(θ) To generate random points uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere within a circle shaped window , the following works: α = .9
cosα = cos(α)
z = rand(n)*(cosα - 1.) - cosα
θ = rand(n)*2π
x = sqrt(1. - z.*z).*cos(θ)
y = sqrt(1. - z.*z).*sin(θ) Notice that this algorithm is much more efficient than first generating points uniformly distributed on a sphere (using the previous algorithm) and then rejecting all the points that are outside the circle shaped window.

Afterwords they have this proposition: Notice that they now are talking about the extended real valued functions. So the function can be infinity. Now there are two possibilites as far as I see. The simple functions can take the value infinity, and hence what the proposition gives is true, since then it can converge to infinity. The simple function can only take values in the real numbers, but since they are arbitrary big, they can still converge to infinity in the sense that they can grow beyond all bounds.

However, my instructions besides writing that proof down is to specifically verify that $y=xz$ is irrational.  What does this have to do with anything and how does it prove denseness of irrationals?  Regardless, assume that $x$ is a nonzero rational number and that $z$ is irrational. For the sake of contradiction, assume that $y=xz$ is rational.

We trivially have that the statement is true if $G$ is abelian, so suppose $G$ is not abelian. I consider two cases separately: (1) $p=3$ (2) $p \neq 3$ If we are in case (1), then $G=3^4$, but any group $G$ of the form $G=p^n$ with $p$ prime satisfies $Z(G) \neq \{1_G\}$, as $G$ is not abelian, we have that the center of $G$, $Z(G)$, is a proper normal subgroup of $G$ (it is easy to show normality). For case (2), if $n_p$ is the number of $p-$ Sylow subgroups and $n_3$ is the number of $3-$Sylow subgroups, then applying Sylow theorems we have the conditions:$$(i) \space n_p \equiv 1 (p), \space n_p|3^3 \implies n_p \in \{1,3,3^2,3^3\}$$ $$(ii) n_3 \equiv 1 (3), \space n_3|p \implies n_3 \in \{1,p\}.$$ If $n_p$ or $n_3$ is $1$, then there is one normal subgroup in $G$, so suppose $n_p,n_3 \neq 1$. Then, we have $n_3=p$ and $n_p \in \{3,3^2,3^3\}$. -If $n_p$ is $3$, then $3=n_p\equiv 1 (p)$, so we would have $3=1+pk>p$, on the other hand, $p=n_3\equiv 1 (3)$ which means $p=1+3j>3$, which is clearly absurd. -If $n_p=3^2$, by the same argument of congruence modulo $p$, we have $3^2-1=pk$, but then $p|3-1=2$ or $p|3+1=4$. If $p|2$, then $p=2$, which is absurd by the condition $n_3=p$. If $n_p|4$, then $3<p\leq 4$, there is no prime greater than $3$ and less than or equal to $4$.

936681,"Volume of a sphere ""corner""","I would like to find the formula of the volume of the ""corner"" of a sphere of radius R, more specifically the volume delimited in a sphere by the intersection of two perpendicular planes, one parallel to the (Oxz) plane at a distance from it, and the other parallel to the (Oxy) plane also at a distance D from it. This might not be extremely clear without a drawing, so I will explain where this problem originates from:
Consider a cube with edge $2D$, and a sphere of radius $R$ with the center of the sphere at the center of the cube. The sphere grows (e.g. with time) and we would like to determine the volume of the sphere lying inside the cube.
At first, the sphere is totally inside the cube, so the answer is easy and that volume is
$$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times R^3$$
This formula holds up to the point where the sphere is inscribed in the cube, ie $R = D$.
Then, the sphere keeps growing. We thus need to remove from the formula above the volume of each spherical cap above each face to obtain the formula of the sphere volume inside the cube:
$$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times R^3 - 6 \times V_\text{cap} $$ with
$$ V_\text{cap} = \frac{\pi h^2}{3} \times (3R - h) $$
where $ h = R-D $ is the height of the spherical cap. This formula holds until the spherical caps start overflowing over the edges and intersect with the spherical cap from the adjacent face (at $ R = D \sqrt 2$ ). for $ R > D \sqrt 2$, the formula above actually removes twice the volume of the intersection of each pair of spherical caps (one pair per edge), while we only need to remove it once. Hence the actual formula is:
$$ V = V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times R^3 - 6 \times V_\text{cap} + 12 \times V_\text{cap-intersection} $$
Now the tricky part (where I need help) is to actually find the formula for the volume of the intersections of each pair of spherical caps. If you draw it, it actually looks like the corner of a sphere (the space stuck between the two perpendicular planes intersecting and the edge of the sphere). I was not able to compute correctly that volume using integral calculus (probably due to some mistakes in the long and tedious calculus), hence my question. Any help or lead to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.","['geometry', 'volume', 'spherical-geometry']"

$|A+I| = |A|+\text{tr}(A) + 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{3} |M_{i,i}|$, where $M_{i,i}$ is the determinant of the i,i-th minor, i.e. the determinant of the matrix that ensues when we remove the i-th row and i-th column from the original matrix $A$.

936802,An Exercise on showing thoroughly that two sets are equal,"I have never had too many exercises on this subject. So while doing a couple of exercises I stumbled across a problem that keeps me confused, especially because I cannot honestly say that I understand what's going on: $$ U \setminus (U \setminus A ) = A , \text{ where } A \subset U$$ Of course this is right, a simple venn-diagram shows that, however showing the two inclusions I have a feeling that my reasoning is not good enough: \begin{align}\text{Let $x \in U \setminus (U \setminus A)$ be fixated but arbitrary}  &\implies x \in U \wedge x \notin (U \setminus A) \\ &\implies x \in U \wedge \neg( x \in (U \setminus A)) \\ &\implies x \in U \wedge \neg(x \in U \wedge x \notin A) \\ &\implies x \in U \wedge(x \notin U \vee x \in A) \\ \implies \underbrace{(x \in U \wedge x \notin U )}_{\text{false}} \vee (x \in U \wedge x \in A) \implies x \in A\end{align} If I have done the exercise correctly, then I fail to understand the vacuously wrong statement that x is an element of $U$ and at the same time isn't. This seems to be equivalent with the statement that $x \in \emptyset$ which exists in Mathematics as a general wrong statement, meaning that if $x \in \emptyset \implies $Euler was my teacher. If I can work with the empty set then I have an idea how to show the other inclusion $A \subset U \setminus (U \setminus A)$, if not then I must practice some more on the topic.

936815,Strong and weak extrema,"I am confused about the ""strength"" of the two definitions. The definitions I use are the following: Let $y$ be a function defined on the set $M$ . Neighborhood (0. order) of the function $y$ is the set $U$ of functions $g$ on $M$ such that: $\exists\epsilon>0:\{g;|g(x)-y(x)|<\epsilon ; \forall x\in M\}\subset U$ Let $y$ be a function defined on the set $M$ where $f$ is also differentiable. Neighborhood (1. order) of the function $y$ is the set $U$ of functions $g$ defined and differentiable on $M$ such that: $\exists\epsilon>0: \{g; |g(x)-y(x)|<\epsilon;|g'(x)-y'(x)|<\epsilon;  \forall x\in M\}\subset U$ The definition of the actual extremas are standard ( $F(y)\geq F(y_0)$ for all functions within the neighbourhood) Now an extremum is strong if it satisfies the 0. order neighborhod definition and weak if it satisfies the second definition. My text then goes on saying Clearly every strong relative extremum is a weak relative extremum. The opposite does not hold I don't see how that could be - it seems to me that it should be the exact opposite, since the 1. order has more restrictions.

If I calculate the divergence of $g$ I get $6$. This seems to be saying that if the 'fluid' is flowing down it cancels out the positive horizontal flow. And if the fluid is flowing up it combines with the horizontal flow. This doesn't seem right, we have the same magnitudes in both directions for $f$ and $g$, $g$ simply goes in the opposite direction for the $\overrightarrow j$ component. Intuitively it seems to me that for $f$ and $g$ and for any point $(x, y)$ we should have a divergence of $6$...ie. at any point, the fluid is flowing out from it as opposed to towards it?","['fluid-dynamics', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"

936945,A Countable Powerset -- Where am I wrong?,"Cantor's Theorem seems pretty airtight to me. So what is wrong with the following reasoning? Consider $X = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. We say $X$ contains uncountably many sets . But the only sets that exist are those asserted to exist by the axioms. So if we consider each of the axioms that assert more sets, starting with $\emptyset$, we have one set. The pairing axiom can only produce countably many more. Union gives us up to one more set per set in existence. Powerset also gives us up to one more set per set in existence. Separation and replacement gives us countably many more sets per set in existence. Infinity gives us more more set. Foundation gives us one more set per set in existence. Choice also only gives us one more set per set in existence. It seems to me that the axioms only ever define countably many sets. So when we consider all the subsets of a set, there might be uncountably many things that satisfy the condition of being a subset, but only countably many of them are possibly sets . If sets can only contain sets, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ must be countable. I'm still not getting the argument about parameters coming from somewhere . I understand the notion of parameters in the context of definability in a structure , but this question is about a theory (ZFC), whose axioms are well formed formulas in the language of set theory ($\forall,\land,\neg,\in$). Thus technically all the separation and replacement axioms do not contain any parameters, right? Considering the example set: $$ X = \{ (n,k) | 2^{\aleph_n} = \aleph_k \} $$ When all the subsets of $\mathbb{N}^2$ are added, surely $X$ is among them? We can say with certainty is that $X$ exists at this stage (because it is definable...or perhaps we can only say there is a plethora of possibilities for $X$ in existance?), but we would be unable to enumerate the pairs (ie say which subset of $\mathbb{N}^2$ it is) without making more assertions about the continuum. I like this idea that there can exist subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that are undefinable without parameters that come from sets of a higher rank. Perhaps there is a forcing notion that makes $X$ one of these in a particular model. But are there uncountably many of them?",['elementary-set-theory']

936987,Does a generalization of the Teichmüller-character for non-prime arguments exist?,"Rereading an older article on Fermat-quotients in which I'd applied some p-adic-rationale I find now, that my method for the representation of bases $b$ which allow high fermat-quotients $b_{p,m}^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod {p^m}$ as digit-string in the numbersystem to base $p$ is just the "" Teichmüller-character "" (or ""-representation""(?)). Because I wanted to analyze things further I thought to apply that procedures to composites numbers $n$ as well instead only to primes $p$ - at least so far as possible. However, the Teichmüller-character is only defined for prime modules $p$ (and for instance its implementation in Pari/GP gives wrong results for non-prime arguments). So my question (to prevent attempts to reinvent the wheel or trying to quadrature the circle) is Q1: Is there a generalization of the Teichmüller-character to non-prime arguments known/possible? and optimally: Q2: how could I implement this algorithmically? Comment: I've a basic routine for this for the prime-arguments which seems to work even for composite (but squarefree) bases, but for composite $n$ containing primefactors to second or higher powers this method runs sometimes in impossible inversion in the modular computation (and also not all residue-classes can be used). So likely any generalization has some limitations/restrictions, but I hope that this might come out to be systematic with a not too complicated pattern.
