93509,Functional inverse of $\sin\theta\sqrt{\tan\theta}$,"What is the functional inverse of $f(\theta) = \sin\theta\sqrt{\tan\theta}$? Or, equivalently, what is the inverse of 
$$f(\theta)=\sin^2\,\theta\tan\,\theta=\frac{\sin^3\,\theta}{\cos\,\theta}$$ It comes from a physics setup involving two equivalently massed and charged pith balls separated by a certain distance, and the equation simplifies to $q = 4L\sin\theta\sqrt{\pi\epsilon_0mg\tan{\theta}}$, where $\pi$, $g$, and $\epsilon_0$ are the obvious physical constants and $L$ and $m$ will be fixed. The question asked for $\theta$ in terms of $q$, however, so I'm wondering if there is a way to rearrange this.

I'm considering the possibility of using the formal derivative, and the fact that a polynomial is relatively prime to its formal derivative iff it is squarefree, but I don't see how to proceed with this.

93562,Finding inverse of a difficult function,"Hi I'd like to find the inverse of:
$$
y=(1/3)(x^{4} + 4x^{3})

$$y=2x-1$$
$$x=2y-1$$
$$x+1=2y$$
$$(x+1)/2=y$$
$$f^{-1}(x)=(x+1)/2$$ Process: Change the x's into y's and the y's into x's Rearrange the equation to get a single y (formerly x) by itself on one side Replace y with $f^{-1}(x)$ But the equation I am working with seems too complicated.  I can't get x by itself on one side because the terms are to the power of 2 and 4. Can anyone suggest a way forward?
Thanks. UPDATE: As has been pointed out by some people the inverse of the said function is actually quite complicated and it turns out I was over complicating things myself.  The main thing I am working on is to show that the roots of the equation $$x^{3}+4x^{2}-3=0$$ can be found (approximately) using iteration formulae which are rearrangements of the equation.  After some trial and error I cam up with the following rearrangements which between them cover the three roots.
$$x_{n+1}=(3-4x^{2})^{1/2}$$
$$x_{n+1}=(1/4)(3/x - x^{2})$$
$$x_{n+1}=((1/4)(3-x^{3}))^{1/2}$$

93573,All general solutions of differential equation satisfy boundary conditions - How to interpret?,"I'm solving the below differential equation: $$ 3z^2 U'(z) -2 U(z)^2 - z U(z) + 2 = 0$$ I have two boundary conditions - $U(0)=1$, $U'(0) = -\frac{1}{4}$, however it is apparent that the set of solutions to this equation, before imposing the initial conditions, satisfy the first initial condition $U(0)=1$. Looking at the differential equation this is because it can be rearranged to: $$ [U(0)]^2 = 1 $$ So it is evident that all of the general solutions should fit this condition. What's more, through ""numerical experiment"", I believe that the first derivative condition should be satisfied as well (though I can't prove it from the differential equation). I am not sure that I can set the constant of integration to be anything I want, as this changes the behaviour of the solution. However, I can simplify the solution greatly by choosing ""convenient"" values of this constant. Also the resulting function is a function of $\frac{1}{z}$, so it cannot actually be evaluated at 0, so I have been using limits, which feels quite mathematically dodgy. This is a peculiarity that I have not come up against before - how exactly am I to interpret this?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

93589,Alternate definition of a 'geodesic ball',"Background: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold.  Let $p \in M$ and $\epsilon \gt 0$. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, the standard definition (correct me if I'm wrong) for the 'geodesic ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $p$' is: $$B = \{ \gamma(1) \mid \gamma \text{ is a geodesic}, \gamma(0)=p, \text{ and } \langle \gamma'(0), \gamma'(0) \rangle \, \lt \epsilon \} .$$ I am wondering: suppose we instead consider the set $$B_{\text{alt}} = \{ \gamma(\epsilon) \mid \gamma \text{ is a geodesic}, \gamma(0)=p, \text{ and } \langle \gamma'(0), \gamma'(0) \rangle  \lt 1 \} .$$ (Roughly speaking, $B$ takes an $\epsilon$-ball in $T_pM$ and runs the geodesics forward by 1, while $B_{\text{alt}}$ takes the unit ball in $T_pM$ and runs the geodesics forward by $\epsilon$.  $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ is the metric inner product.) Question: Do we have $B = B_{\text{alt}}$?  If not, is there a nice counter-example?  Or an intuitive reason why we should not expect the equality to hold? Note: I have tried to compute the volume of $B_{\text{alt}}$ (to next-to-leading order in $\epsilon$) in the special case of a two-dimensional manifold with a diagonal metric.  Despite many careful checks, my answer does not match the standard answer for the volume of a geodesic ball -- so I suspect that $B \ne B_{\text{alt}}$. Thanks for any help! Appendix - calculation of $Vol(B_{alt})$ (added 12/23) I'm going to redo my calculation of the volume of $B_{alt}$, taking account of joriki's comment below.  The problem I was having (which I don't think is resolved by joriki's suggestion to replace $\epsilon$ by $\epsilon^{1/2}$, but will have to check to be sure) is described in the next two paragraphs. I'm doing the calculation in a particular coordinate chart, assuming the metric is diagonal: $ds^2 = g_{11}(x^1,x^2) (dx^1)^2 + g_{22}(x^1,x^2) (dx^2)^2$.  I find that $Vol(B_{alt})$ includes (at next-to-leading order in $\epsilon$) the terms $(\partial_1)^2 g_{11}|_p$ and $(\partial_2)^2 g_{22}|_p$.  In a diagonal metric (and using the Levi-Civita connection), the only Christoffel symbol in which $\partial_1 g_{11}$ appears is $\Gamma^1_{11} = \frac{1}{2} g^{11} \partial_1 g_{11}$.  However, the formula $R^a_{bcd} = \partial_c \Gamma^a_{db} - \partial_d \Gamma^a_{cb} + \Gamma^a_{ce} \Gamma^e_{db} - \Gamma^a_{de} \Gamma^e_{cb}$ shows that $\partial_1 \Gamma^1_{11}$ doesn't appear in the scalar curvature - the first two terms in the preceeding formula just cancel when all indices are equal to 1. Now I will explain how these bad terms appear in my calculation.  My approach is to calculate $Vol(B_{alt}) = \int_{B_{alt}} dx^1 dx^2 \sqrt{g_{11}(x^1,x^2) g_{22}(x^1,x^2)}$ by Taylor-expanding the integrand about the point $p \leftrightarrow (x^1_0,x^2_0)$.  Given $a\ \partial_1 |_p + b\ \partial_2 |_p$ in the unit ball in $T_pM$, the corresponding point in $B_{alt}$ is $(x^1_0 + a\ \epsilon + C(a,b)\ \epsilon^2 + O(\epsilon^3), x^2_0 + b\ \epsilon + D(a,b)\ \epsilon^2 + O(\epsilon^3))$, where $C,D$ are constants we can get from the geodesic equation.(**)  There's a Jacobian factor to change variables from $(x^1, x^2)$ to $(a,b)$.  But the only way (it seems to me) to get the second derivatives of the metric that appear in $R$ is to Taylor-expand $\sqrt{det\quad g}$ to second order.  That's exactly the order at which the bad terms $(\partial_1)^2 g_{11}|_p$ and $(\partial_2)^2 g_{22}|_p$ appear (even if we replace $\epsilon$ by $\epsilon^{1/2}$). (**) $C(a,b) = -\frac{1}{2}(a^2 \Gamma^1_{11} + b^2 \Gamma^1_{22} + a\ b\ \Gamma^1_{12})|_p$. Thank you Srivatsan for your TeX edits...

93594,fundamental group intuition,"So I understand the mechanics of the fundamental group, but I want to gain a more natural intuition behind it. I imagine the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(X)$ to detect ""holes"" in a space. For example, it detects the hole in the punctured plane. However, it does not detect all type of holes, specifically the hole at $\mathbb{R}^3-0$. Presumably, $\pi_{2}(\mathbb{R}^3-0)$ could do the job in this case. I was wondering if you guys could give me some more geometrical intuition behind the fundamental group. For example, what types of ""holes"" can $\pi_{1}(X)$ detect?

93607,Regularizing divergent series and Bernoulli numbers,"Here is the actual problem I need a proof for: (I made an error writing down the  equation initially) $$B_{k+1} = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^{k+2}-2} \sum_{q=0}^{k} \binom{k+1}{q} 2^q B_q$$ Below is my motivation why I am looking at the problem. Kindly pardon the long post. I was looking at some diverging series on how to regularize them to get a finite answer. For instance, $$1+1+\cdots = - \frac12$$ can be obtained through the analytic continuation based on geometric series (or) the zeta function evaluated at the origin. Similarly, we have that
$$
\begin{array}{lr}
1^1 + 2^1 + \cdots = & -\frac1{12}\\
1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots = & 0\\
1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots = & \frac1{120}\\
1^4 + 2^4 + \cdots = & 0
\end{array}
$$
And in general, the zeta-regularization (or) analytic continuation based on geometric series gives us
$$
\begin{align}
1^k + 2^k + \cdots & = \zeta(-k)
\end{align}
$$
However, they don't satisfy some nice relations/ recurrence satisfied by their finite counter parts. The first and foremost one which struck me was the one below.
$$
\begin{align}
1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left( 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n\right)^2
\end{align}
$$
whereas
$$
\zeta(-3) \neq \zeta(-1)^2
$$
Though there is no reason for $\zeta(-3)$ to equal $\zeta(-1)^2$, I was wondering if only we could assign a different value to the diverging series $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots$ and $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots$ so that we can still have $$
\begin{align}
1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots = (1+2+3+\cdots)^2
\end{align}
$$
To do so, we turn out attention to their finite counterparts, $S(n;k) = 1^k + 2^k + \cdots n^k$. As mentioned earlier, we have some nice relations among $S(n;k)$ for different $k$'s.
For instance, we have
$$
\begin{array}{rrc}
S(n;1) & = & \frac{S(n;0)(S(n;0)+1)}{2}\\
S(n;2) & = & \frac{S(n;1)(2S(n;0) + 1)}{3}\\
S(n;3) & = & S(n;1)^2\\
1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 & = & (1+2+ \cdots + n)^2\\
S(n;4) & = & \frac{S(n;2) (6S(n;1)-1)}{5}
\end{array}
$$
In general, we have $S(n;k) = P_k(S(n;0))$ where $P_k(a)$ is a polynomial in $a$ of degree $k+1$ and are called the Faulhaber polynomials and given by $$P_k(n) = \frac{n^{k+1}}{k+1} \sum_{j=0}^{k} \left[ \binom{k+1}{j} \left( - \frac1n \right)^{j} B_j \right]$$
where $B_k$ are the Bernoulli numbers.
For instance, $$
\begin{array}{rll}
P_0(a) & = a\\
P_1(a) & = \frac{a^2+a}{2} & = \frac{P_0(a) \left( P_0(a)+1 \right)}{2}\\
P_2(a) & = \frac{a(a+1)(2a+1)}{6} & = \frac{\left( 2P_0(a)+1 \right)P_1(a)}{3}\\
P_3(a) & = \frac{a^2(a+1)^2}{4} & = \left( P_1(a) \right)^2
\end{array}
$$ We would like to define $$1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S(n;k) = s_k$$ in a way consistent with the recurrence satisfied by the finite sums i.e. we would want $$s_k = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S(n;k) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P_k(S(n;0)) = P_k \left( \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S(n;0) \right) = P_k(s_0)$$
As mentioned before, unfortunately, the analytic continuation based on geometric series (or) zeta-regularization doesn't satisfy this. For instance, $$\zeta(-1) = -\frac1{12} \neq -\frac18 = \frac{-\frac12 (-\frac12 + 1)}{2} = \frac{\zeta(0) (\zeta(0) + 1)}{2} = P_1 \left( \zeta(0) \right)$$
Similarly, $$\zeta(-3) = \frac1{120} \neq \left( -\frac1{12} \right)^2 = \zeta(-1)^2$$
So I was wondering if we could find another regularization still respecting the recurrence relation satisfied by their finite counterparts subject to $\displaystyle s_0 = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S(n;0) = -\frac12$.
Let us look at what we would want our $s_k$'s to be if we want the recurrences to be satisfied.
$$
\begin{align}
s_1 = & P_1(s_0) = & \frac{s_0(s_0 + 1)}{2} = & -\frac18\\
s_2 = & P_2(s_0) = & \frac{(2s_0 + 1)s_1}{3} = & 0\\
s_3 = & P_3(s_0) = & \frac{s_0^2(s_0 + 1)^2}{2^2} = & \frac1{64}
\end{align}
$$
One nice thing to notice is that $P_k(-1/2) = 0$ whenever $k$ is even which coincides with $\zeta(-k)$ whenever $k$ is even. Hence, $s_{k} = P_k(s_0) = P_k(-1/2) = 0$, whenever $k$ is even.
Proceeding on the same lines for the odd numbers, we obtain the table shown below.
$$
\begin{array}{lcrlrrl}
1^1 + 2^1 + \cdots& \text{   }& P_1(-1/2) = & -\frac18& \text{   }& \zeta(-1) = & -\frac1{12}\\

1^9 + 2^9 + \cdots& \text{   }& P_9(-1/2) = & -\frac{31}{2048}& \text{   }& \zeta(-9) = & -\frac1{132}\\
1^{11} + 2^{11} + \cdots& \text{   }& P_{11}(-1/2) = & \frac{691}{16384}& \text{   }& \zeta(-11) = & \frac{691}{32760}\\
1^{13} + 2^{13} + \cdots& \text{   }& P_{13}(-1/2) = & -\frac{5461}{32768}& \text{   }& \zeta(-13) = & -\frac{1}{12}\\
1^{15} + 2^{15} + \cdots& \text{   }& P_{15}(-1/2) = & \frac{929569}{1048576}& \text{   }& \zeta(-15) = & \frac{3617}{8160}
\end{array}
$$
and so on. However, there is a nice relationship which I observed empirically but am not able to prove $$\zeta(-k) = \frac{P_{k}(-1/2)}{2 - \frac1{2^{k}}}$$
From some results on $\zeta$ functions and Bernoulli numbers, we have$$\displaystyle \zeta(-k) = - \frac{B_{k+1}}{k+1}$$ and $$\displaystyle P_{k}(-1/2) = \frac1{k+1} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2^{k+2}-2} \sum_{q=0}^{k} \binom{k+1}{q} 2^q B_q$$ Hence, it boils down to proving the following relationship $$B_{k+1} = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^{k+2}-2} \sum_{q=0}^{k} \binom{k+1}{q} 2^q B_q$$ Hence, now we not only have $S(n;k) = P_k(S(n;0))$ but also $s_k = P_k(s_0)$ where $$s_k = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S(n;k) = \left( 2 - 2^{-k} \right) \zeta(-k)$$ Hence, if the above is true, instead of assigning the value of the diverging series $1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots$ to $\zeta(-k)$, to carry over the nice recurrence relations satisfied by their finite counterparts, would it be nice to assign a value of $(2-2^{-k}) \zeta(-k)$ to the diverging series $1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots$ so that for instance, $$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots = (1+2 +3 + \cdots)^2$$ would still be true. Apart from what I have argued above, is there any other reason why one would like to associate the value $(2-2^{-k}) \zeta(-k)$ to the diverging series $1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots ?$","['divergent-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'zeta-functions', 'combinatorics']"

Also because the limit  is equal to  $3$ at point $2$, it means that left or right limit is also equal to $3$, so $a+2b=3$

For clarification, suppose you have the function

In this case  if we take limit from right side as $x$ approaches $0$ our result must be more than $5$ because it is always above $5$ when $x>0$, right?

A measure $\mu$ on a $\sigma$-algebra $S$ of subsets of $X$ is called atomic if every measurable set of positive measure contain an atom. Here by an atom we mean a  set set $E\in S$ with $\mu(E)>0$ such that for every $F\subset E$ with $F\in S$ we have $\mu(F)=0$ or $\mu(E\setminus F)=0$). I found the following example ( page 651, Example 1.3 ) but I did not understand everything. Assume that $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space in which all singletons are not in $G_\delta$ (Examples of such topologies are here ). Let $S$ be a $\sigma$ -algebra generated by all compact $G_\delta$ subsets of $X$. For each $x \in X$ we define a measure $\mu_x$ on $S$ by putting $\mu_x(E)=1$ if $x \in E$ and $\mu_x(E)=0$ otherwise. Let $\mu$ be a measure on $S$ defined by $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ and $\mu(E)=\infty$ otherwise. How to show that $\mu(E)=\sum \{\mu_x(E): x \in X\}$ for all $E\in S$? It is clear that it suffices to know that every nonempty $E\in S$ is infinite.

More generally, one can show that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)\cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)=\mathbb{Q}$ when $\gcd(n,m)=1$. The only proof of this fact that comes to mind uses facts about discriminants of cyclotomic extensions, and the fact that every non-trivial number field extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ ramifies at least at one prime (see, for instance, Washington, ""Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields"", Chapter 2, Proposition 2.4).

93729,How many fours are needed to represent numbers up to $N$?,"The goal of the four fours puzzle is to represent each natural number using four copies of the digit $4$ and common mathematical symbols. For example, $165=\left(\sqrt{4} + \sqrt{\sqrt{{\sqrt{4^{4!}}}}}\right) \div .4$. If we remove the restriction on the number of fours, let $f(N)$ be the number of fours required to be able to represent all positive integers no greater than $N$. What is the asymptotic behaviour of $f(N)$? Can it be shown that $f(N) \sim r \log N$ for some $r$? To be specific, let’s restrict the operations to the following: addition: $x+y$ subtraction: $x-y$ multiplication: $x\times y$ division: $x\div y$ exponentiation: $y^x$ roots: $\sqrt[x]{y}$ square root: $\sqrt{x}$ factorial $n!$ decimal point: $.4$ recurring decimal: $. \overline 4$ It is easy to see that $f(N)$ is $O(\log N)$. For example, with four fours, numbers up to $102$ can be represented (see here for a tool for generating solutions), so, since $96 = 4\times4!$, we can use $6k-2$ fours in the form
$(\dots((a_1\times 96+a_2)\times 96+a_3)\dots)\times96+a_k$
to represent every number up to $96^k$. On the other hand, we can try to count the number of distinct expressions that can be made with $k$ fours. For example, if we (arbitrarily) permit factorial only to be applied to the digit $4$, and allow no more than two successive applications of the square root operation, we get $\frac{216^k}{18}C_{k-1}$ distinct expressions where $C_k$ is the $k$th Catalan number. (Of course, many of these expressions won’t represent a positive integer, many different expressions will represent the same number, and the positive integers generated won’t consist of a contiguous range from $1$ to some $N$.) Using Stirling’s formula, for large $k$, this is approximately $\frac{864^k}{72k\sqrt{\pi k}}$. So for $f(N)$ to grow slower than $r\log N$, we’d need to remove the restrictions on the use of unary operations. (It is well-known that the use of logs enables any number to be represented with only four fours.) Can this approach be extended to show that $f(N)$ is $\Omega(\log N)$? Or does unrestricted use of factorial and square roots 
  mean that $f(N)$ is actually $o(\log N)$?

Also $H(p)=\log \frac{1}{p}$ is additive in the following sense. If $E$ and $F$ are two independent events with probabilities $p$ and $q$ respectively, then $H(pq)=H(p)+H(q)$. As far as I know, mainly for these two reasons $H(p)=\log \frac{1}{p}$ is considered as a measure of information contained in a random event $E$ with probability $p>0$. On the other hand, if we average the exponentiated lengths, $\sum p_i2^{tl_i}, t>0$, subject to the same Kraft inequality constraints, the optimal solution is $l_i=\log \frac{1}{p_i'}$ where $p_i'=\frac{p_i^{\alpha}}{\sum_k p_k^{\alpha}}, \alpha=\frac{1}{1+t}$, called Campbell's problem. Now $H_{\alpha}(p_i)=\log \frac{1}{p_i'}$ is also additive in the sense that $H_{\alpha}(p_i p_j)=H_{\alpha}(p_i)+H_{\alpha}(p_j)$. Moreover $H_{\alpha}(1)=0$ as in the case of Shannon's measure. Also note that, when $\alpha=1$, $H_1(p_i)=\log \frac{1}{p_i}$ we get back Shannon's measure. My question is, are these reasons suffice to call $H_{\alpha}(p_i)=\log \frac{1}{p_i'}$ a (generalized) measure of information?

93928,"Is $[0,1]$ an *oriented* manifold with boundary? (and Stokes theorem)","The definitions I am using are a manifold with boundary is something locally homeomorphic to $(0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$. an oriented manifold is one where the transition functions between any two charts have positive Jacobian. Its clear that $[0,1]$ is a manifold with boundary. Is it oriented? I seem to be getting the conclusion that it is not, because around $0$, the local chart is $x \to 1-x$, and around $1$ the local chart is $x \to x$, and these have opposite orientations. But Stokes theorem surely should apply to this setting and reduce to the fundamental theorem of calculus. Recall that Stokes theorem says that if $M$ is a compact oriented $n$-manifold with boundary $\partial M$ with the induced orientation, and $\omega$ is an $n-1$ form, then $$\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_M d\omega.$$
Taking $\omega=f$ a zero form, i.e., function and $M=[0,1]$, I expect to recover $$f(1)-f(0) = \int_0^1 f'(x) dx ,$$ so $[0,1]$ I suspect is an oriented manifold with boundary, but I'm not seeing exactly why. In a related vein, I think I can see intuitively that the closed unit disk is an oriented manifold with boundary, and then Stokes gives Green's theorem. @Bill, in a comment below you wrote ""the chart containing 1 orients the interval 0→1.""  Well, let me be more precise: the chart $U_1=(0,1] \to (0,1]$ given by $x \to x$ (for $x \in (0,1]$) orients $(0,1]$. I cannot extend this particular chart to include $0$ because then $[0,1]$ would not be a homeomorphic to $(0,1]$ which is in my definition of manifold with closed boundary. To get a chart including the zero, I need to include another chart, e.g $U_2=[0,1)$ and then the map $x \to 1-x$ would be a homeomorphism $U_2 \to (0,1]$ as required in the definition I am using for manifold with boundary. But now, these charts have opposite orientations. I don't know how to come up with two (or more) charts that do not give opposite orientations.  The definition of manifold with boundary I am using is the one on p.25 of Voisin's Hodge Theory and Complex Analytic Geometry 1, and its easily seen to be equivalent to the more standard one homeomorphic to an open subset of the closed upper half plane.

94033,Heat kernel on a noncompact manifold,"I'd like to understand some issues about the heat problem related to the Laplacian of a Riemannian manifold especially when the manifold is noncompact.
So first recall the heat equation on a Riemannian $C^{\infty}$-Manifold $(M,g)$. When $M$ is compact, there is a unique function, the heat kernel, $K \in C^\infty (M \times M \times \mathbb{R^+})$ satisfying $(\partial_t + \Delta_x)K(x,y,t) = 0$ and $ \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \ \int\limits_{M} K(x,y,t)f(y)dvol_y = f(x) \ \ \forall f \in L^2(M) $ And as far as I know this fact stays true If $\partial M \neq \varnothing$ when one inserts an appropriate boundary condition (i.e. Dirichlet-condition) for the Problem. When $(M,g)$ is considered to be noncompact (the examples I want to examine are mainly conformally compact metrics) there is, as far as I know, no such $C^{\infty}$-Kernel but
a distributional solution of the heat problem defining (as a distributional Schwartz kernel)  a kind of (pseudodifferential ?) operator, that ""has a conormal singularity"" on the diagonal $D:= \{(x,x,0) | x \in M \} \subset M\times M \times \mathbb{R}$. My first question is: Is that correct so far? (1) edit: After further investigation I got confused about the question, if a $C^{\infty}$-heat-kernel for a noncompact manifold exists. In Isaac Chavel's book ""Eigenvalues in Riemannian Geometry"" there is a theorem on page 188 in chapter XIII, that says: There IS a a $C^{\infty}$-kernel. Is that right or did I miss something? 
(Here is the Google-books link: http://books.google.de/books?id=0v1VfTWuKGgC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false ) Until now I'm not very familiar with pseudodifferential operator calculus (but I want to improve my knowledge) and so I ask myself the following question: (2) Why can't there be an $C^{\infty}$-Solution like in the compact case? How can one prove that there can't be? Or can anybody refer to a
book/paper/lecture note where this question is concerned? (3) What does ""conormal singularity"" with respect to some submanifold $Y$ exactly mean? I just vague know that it means to have a singularity much stronger in normal direction than in tangential direction and it is related to the Fourier transform. Nevertheless it stays mysterious to me. How can the occurence of the conormal singularity of the heat kernel for noncompact manifolds be seen? I would be happy for any comments or small hints, too!

Assume it has a smooth coordinate neighborhood in which the coordinate frame is orthonormal, i.e., a local frame $(E_1,...,E_n)$ on an open set $U$ around $p$ such that $\langle E_i,E_j\rangle_g=\delta_{ij}$ . Since $M$ is a smooth manifold, $U$ is diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the diffeomorphism $F$ . So, it suffices to  show that $F^\ast g= \tilde{g}$ , where $\tilde{g}$ is Euclidean metric. By the definition of Riemannian metric, this is true. (Is this true really?) (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (i): Assume $g$ is flat, i.e., every point $p$ in $M$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $(U,g|_U)$ is isometric to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Euclidean metric. So $U$ is diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F^\ast g= \tilde{g}$ , where $\tilde{g}$ is Euclidean metric.

First, on page 44, equation $(3)$ we have the integral $$\iint_{D_{r}} \frac{\partial f(\zeta)}{\partial \overline{\zeta}} \frac{d \overline{\zeta} \wedge d \zeta}{\zeta - z},$$
where f is a $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ function in an open neighborhood of $\overline{D}$, $D$ an open subset of the complex plane bounded by a rectifiable simple curve $\gamma$, $z \in D$ and $D_{r} = D - \overline{\Delta}(z; r)$ for $r$ such that the disc is in $D$. Gunning says that since $(\zeta - z)^{-1} d \overline{\zeta} \wedge d \zeta$ is a bounded measure in the plane, the integral above converges to the integral over $D$ as $r$ tends to zero. I can not understand $(\zeta - z)^{-1} d \overline{\zeta} \wedge d \zeta$ as a measure, much less bounded in the plane. On page 45, we have the integral $$g(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \iint_{\mathbb{C}^{1}} \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta - z} d \zeta \wedge d \overline{\zeta},$$
where $f$ is a $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ function that vanishes outside a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$. Gunning says that this function is $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{1}$ (if $f$ is holomorphic, then $g$ is holomorphic). Why, if we have $(\zeta - z)$ in the denominator?

That is we start at (0,0) and facing ""north"", at each step we either turn left, stay straight, or turn right each with Pr = 1/3. For example the possible positions after 1 step are: (-1,0) (facing west) (0,1) (facing north) (1,0) (facing east) The distribution on the next step depends on the last step you took, so you cannot immediately return to the spot you just came from (this is what my friend does when he ""randomly"" walks in Manhattan, it is boring to turn completely around).

For example: number 10 (>2) and consider that non prime as NP and prime is P. 10 = 1 + 9 or 2 + 8 or 3 + 7 or 4 + 6 or 5 + 5 I am sure there is prime + prime in every even integer. We can notice that every integer > 2 can be expressible any one of the above form. If P + P is not taken place in the above example, then there is no question of discussion of GC. Now, find the number of primes in fraction. If the fraction is > ¼, then we need not to discuss further proof of GC.  No matter what fraction we have taken, we find the same. If the fraction of primes is 1/8, then the probability of finding N + P are 6/16, but we require 8/16 to avoid any P + P sums. If the fraction of primes is 1/10, then the probability of finding N + P are 8/25, but we require 10/25 to avoid any P + P sums. The probability is always strongly in favor of a P + P. So, we can conclude the GC. Here: n is non prime and p is prime","['conjectures', 'number-theory']"
