4677188,Approximation of $\sqrt{2}$.,"Let $(x_n)$ be the sequence define by \begin{cases}
x_1 = 1 \\
x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left( x_n + \frac{2}{x_n} \right)
\end{cases} .
Show that $1\leqslant x_n \leqslant\frac{3}{2}\ \forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ . I've tried by induction. My induction hypothesis was the vadility of $1\leqslant x_k \leqslant\frac{3}{2}$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$ . From that it is easy to show that $x_{k+1}\geqslant 1$ . In fact, $1\leqslant x_k$ implies $3\leqslant x_k^2+2$ and $x_k\leqslant\frac{3}{2}$ implies $1\leqslant\frac{3}{2x_k}$ . Then, \begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= \frac{x_k^2+2}{2x_k}\\
 &\geqslant \frac{3}{2x_k}\\
&\geqslant 1.
\end{align} But I'm stuck with $x_{k+1}\leqslant\frac{3}{2}$ . I only get $x_{k+1}\leqslant\frac{17}{8}$ , way over $\frac{3}{2}$ .
I think there must be some preliminay result that makes this last part easier, but I do not know. Any hint would be enough. Thanks in advance.","['induction', 'approximation', 'discrete-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series']"

4677224,Convergence of $\int_1^{+\infty}\sin\left( \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right) \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x}}$,"There is an integral $\int_1^{+\infty}\sin\left( \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right) \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x}}$ . Prove that it converges only conditionally. It is absolutely divergent because when $x \to +\infty$ one would have $\frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \to 0$ , so $\left|\sin\left( \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right)\right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right| $ , at least when $x > x_0$ for some $x_0 > 1$ . So for $x > x_0$ one would have $$
\left| \sin\left( \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right| \geq \frac{1}{2}\frac{|\sin(x)|}{x}

Any help would be appreciated. UPD. After reading the comments I came to a solution. Please check it out. We have $$
\sin\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}}\right) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} + g(x)
$$ where $g(x) = o\left(\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x}\right)$ when $x \to +\infty$ . So $$
\sin\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + h(x)
$$ where $h(x) = o\left(\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right)$ when $x \to +\infty$ . The integral $\int_1^{+\infty } \frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^{\frac{3}{2}}} dx$ converges absolutely, so $\int_1^{+\infty } h(x) dx$ converges absolutely and the convergence of $\int_1^{+\infty}\sin\left( \frac{\sin(x)}{\sqrt{x}} \right) \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x}}$ depends only on the convergence of $\int_1^{+\infty}\frac{\sin(x)dx}{x}$ . This integral is convergent, so the integral under consideration converges.","['integration', 'solution-verification', 'improper-integrals', 'real-analysis']"

Can I modify Rootman's result such that this other version holds? I basically need to show I am summing over the same set of primes. I proved that the set of primes $q_i$ with $\text{ord}(x_i)=q_i$ for some $x_i$ is contained in Rotman's set of primes. I am having trouble with the other direction. For the sake of completennes here is one inclusion. If $\text{ord}(x)=q$ , we have by Rotman's result that $x=x_1+...+x_t\in \sum_j \oplus_j G(p_j)$ with some $x_j\not=0$ . Considering the fact that $qx=0$ , we have $0=\sum_i q x_i$ .Suppouse by way  of contradiction that $q\not =p_i$ for every $i$ .Because the sum is direct and $qx_i\in G(p_i)$ (indeed, $G(p_i)$ is a subgroup), we have $qx_i=0$ for every $i$ , in particular for $i=j$ . Therefore $qx_j=0$ and $p_j|q$ . Therefore $p_j=q$ .

4677297,Assumption of Normality in Central Limit Theorem,"Regarding the distributions of random variables, I understand the following points: The distribution of the expected value (i.e. ""mean"") of any random variable is (asymptotically) normally distributed - this is stated within the Central Limit Theorem The sums and differences of normally distributed random variables are also normally distributed This being said, now consider the popular ""T-Test"" . The T-Test can be used to determine if the difference between the ""mean value"" of some random variable from two samples are equal or not - in this case, we can consider this ""value"" as a random variable. And since we know that the difference in the ""mean values"" of any two random variables follows a normal distribution, the T-Test exploits this fact and thereby uses the normal distribution to determine the mean differences between two samples is statistically significant or not. Something I have never quite been able to understand: In a T-Test, we are told that we  require the underlying distribution of both samples to be normally distributed - yet, the difference between the mean values of ANY two random variables is normally distributed . My Question: Thus, why is the assumption of normality required in a T-Test when we know that the difference between the mean values of any two random variables is always normally distributed (provided there are enough observations)? I can understand why this might not be the case when we have very few observations in each sample - but when we have many observations in both samples, why is the assumption of bormality still required for the T-Test?

4677298,On different types of convergence of Fourier Series.,"Iâ€˜m currently going through my lecture notes and am a bit confused by the different convergence results and would be happy if someone could clarify:) In the following we always have $f \in L^2((-\pi, \pi), \mathbb{C})$ and $c_k(f):=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) e^{-ikx} \ dx$ . We define the $N^{th}$ Fourier partial sum as: $S_N(f)(x):=\sum_{k=-N}^N c_k(f)e^{ikx}$ . Now my first result is that with $\mathcal{F}:=\{\frac{e^{ikx}}{\sqrt{s\pi}} | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ the span $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal{F})$ , i.e. the Fourier partial sums, are dense in the space of continuous, $2\pi-$ periodic functions with respect to the $L^{\infty}$ norm, i.e. the sup norm (up to set of measure zero). Then it follows (since continuous and compactly supported functions are dense in $L^2((-\pi, \pi), \mathbb{C})$ ), that $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal{F})$ is also dense in all of $L^2((-\pi, \pi), \mathbb{C})$ w.r.t. the $L^2$ norm. Thus $\mathcal{F}$ is a basis for the Hilbert space $L^2((-\pi, \pi), \mathbb{C})$ . Now my professor remarks that the preceding does not imply that the Fourier sequence of Fourier partial sums converges uniformly to any continuous, compactly supported (on $(-\pi, \pi)$ ) $f$ . Iâ€˜m not sure I get that, we have just stated that: $$
\forall \epsilon>0 \ \exists S_N(f) \in \operatorname{Span}(\mathcal{F}): ||f-S_N(f)||_{L^{\infty}}=\operatorname{ess} \sup |f-S_n|=\inf \{M \in \mathbb{R} | \mu(\{x:|f(x)-S_N(f)(x)|>M\})=0\} < \epsilon
$$ Havenâ€™t we? This is equivalent to uniform convergence almost everywhere, isnâ€™t it? Whatâ€™s the problem? Edit: The only problem I see here is that all coefficients in $S_N(f)$ are allowed to change as $\epsilon$ gets smaller, whereas if we consider uniform convergence â€žthe coefficients with lower indicesâ€œ have to stay fixed as $\epsilon$ gets smaller (I hope this makes sense), could that be the issue? What about pointwise convergence almost everywhere, I know that if a sequence of functions converges in $L^p$ norm then there exists a subsequence that converges pointwise almost everywhere. Wouldnâ€™t that suggest that for all $f \in L^2(-\pi, \pi)$ there is a sequence $(N_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ s.t.: $$
f(x)=\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=N_j}^{N_j}c_ke^{ikx}
$$ for almost every $x \in (-\pi, \pi)$ . I fail to see why this doesnâ€™t imply: $$
f(x)=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} S_N(f)(x)
$$ Shouldnâ€™t these limits be identical? Regarding this my professor remarks that we do indeed have pointwise convergence almost everywhere but that this isnâ€™t a direct consequence from Hilbert space theory (only proved in 1966 by L. Carleson). So Iâ€˜d be happy if someone could clarify my confusion regarding uniform and pointwise convergence:)","['measure-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'fourier-series']"

4677318,Apostol: Why exactly is $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}$ not defined at origin if the partial derivative of $\sqrt{|xy|}$ exists at origin?,"Consider the scalar field $f(x,y)=\sqrt{|xy|}$ . Here is a $3D$ plot In Apostol's Calculus we are asked to verify that the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are zero at the origin. I know how to show this by using the definition of partial derivatives. For example $$\frac{\partial f(0,0)}{\partial x}=\lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(\langle 0,0\rangle+h\langle 1,0\rangle)-f(0,0)}{h}\tag{1}$$ $$\lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}\tag{2}$$ $$=0$$ But my question regards the expression $$\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}\tag{3}$$ which is the partial derivative when $x>0$ and $y>0$ (alternatively, when both are negative). What are the precise reasons that this expression isn't true at the origin, and yet the partial derivative is defined at the origin? Note that this expression isn't defined at the origin. But why? It is defined for all points except the origin on the line of points of form $(x,0)$ . To obtain (3), we took the limit of $$\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}\tag{4}$$ and the resulting expression isn't defined at the origin. On the other hand to show that the partial derivative does exist at the origin we took the limit of $$\frac{f(0+h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}\tag{5}$$ It is not clear to me why the limit of this expression is defined, but the limit of (4) evaluated at the origin isn't defined.","['partial-derivative', 'limits', 'multivariable-calculus']"
4677334,Why are these two projective schemes isomorphic?,"From Ravi Vakil's Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, exercise 7.4.C: Let $R = k[x, y, z]/(xz, yz, z^2)$ . Show that $\operatorname{Proj} R \cong \mathbb{P}_k^1$ (as schemes). My thought was to induce a map of schemes via the ring morphism $\phi: R \rightarrow k[s, t]$ , with $x \mapsto s, \; y \mapsto t, \; z \mapsto 0$ . But I don't know how to show that this induces an isomorphism of schemes. In particular, in $\operatorname{Proj} R$ the two ideals $(x + y)$ and $(x + y + z)$ (for example) are different, which doesn't seem to have a counterpart in $\mathbb{P}_k^1$ . Edit: It's been suggested that we can check this locally. To check locally, define $\alpha:k[s,t]â†’R$ by $s,tâ†¦x,y$ . This induces $\pi:\operatorname{Proj}Râ†’\mathbb{P}_1^k$ such that $\pi^{-1}(D(s))=D(x)$ and $\pi^{-1}(D(t))=D(y)$ . I can see that $\pi$ gives a bijection on each of these open sets, but I can't see that it gives isomorphisms of schemes: for example, taking $\varphi:\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj}R}â†’\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_1^k}$ induced by $\alpha$ , we get $\varphi(D(s)):k[\frac{t}{s}]â†’k[\frac{y}{x},\frac{z}{x}]$ , which is not an isomorphism.

4677340,Is probability theory just a theory of finite measure in abstract sense? Or is there anything more to it?,"I have had some exposure to measure theoretic probability theory/Brownian motion, and a bit of analysis. There are a lot of theories in probability whose intuition come from real world example but essentially probability theory is a study of random variable whose domain is a sample space, whose measure is 1 (or finite). So in a sense, there's nothing special about probability theory in an abstract sense. If I view it as something in the category of pure mathematics, is it legitimate to say that probability theory is just a subset of analysis dealing with finite measure? Or, is there any subtlety that I'm missing? I'd appreciate any insights.",['probability-theory']
4677347,How to solve the ODE $(y(x))^{((y'(x))^{((y''(x))^{((y'''(x))^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}})})})}=f(x)$?,"Introduction Why This Question? I have often asked myself what a solution to the Ordinary Differential Equation ( ODE ) would be and when I recently saw this ODE again, tried it again and failed again, I wanted to ask how this ODE was solved could become? The latest reason I'm asking this question has to do with Fractional Calculus , for which I'm asking myself a similar but a lot more complex question. Clarification Of The Question To make the equation clearer: Let's say that $\operatorname{D_{x}^{v}}\left[ f \right]$ is the $v$ th derivative with respect to the variable $x$ of the function $f$ and that the "" Power Tower "" $a^{b^{c^{d^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}}$ is $a^{\left( b^{\left( c^{\left( d^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}} \right)} \right)} \right)}$ .

$$ A Plot of $f$ : Observating Since the ODE contains a sort of infinite "" Power Tower "" and $0^{0}$ is undefined, $\operatorname{D_{x}^{n}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] \ne 0,\, \text{for}\, n \in \mathbb{N}$ must hold 'cause some $\operatorname{D_{x}^{z}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] = 0$ where $z$ is some Number in $\mathbb{N}$ implies $\cdot^{\operatorname{D_{x}^{z}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right]^{\operatorname{D_{x}^{z + 1}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right]^{\cdot}}} = \cdot^{0^{0^{0^{\cdot}}}}$ . This means that $y$ must be derivable infinitely often in at least one interval without ever yielding $0$ in this interval, which already rules out a large number of functions. As I write this I realize that it is difficult to find a legible but correct and accurate notation for this. I would also be open to anyone suggesting a better notation. The simplest case of functions for which this is the case are functions which have a derivative of order $n$ , which gives the function or another derivative of the function itself or in formuls: $\operatorname{D_{x}^{v}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] = \operatorname{D_{x}^{w}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right],\, \text{for}\, \mathbb{N} \ni w \ne v \in \mathbb{N}$ I would solve this ODE like this (for this I'll assume $v > w$ ): $^{\left[ 1 \right]}$ $$

$$ where $\operatorname{cis}$ is the [CiS-Function][8]. That means $\lambda^{v - w} + 1 = \prod\limits_{k = 1}^{\left| \mathbb{S} \right|}\left( \lambda - \operatorname{cis}\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \right)$ where $\mathbb{S}$ is the set of all roots of the equation and $\left| \mathbb{S} \right|$ is the [Cardinality][9] of $\mathbb{S}$ . This gives the multiplicity of the all roots $= 1$ .

$$ where $\mathbb{S} = v - w$ . But there are also the solutions given by: $$
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{D_{x}^{v}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] &= \operatorname{D_{x}^{w}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right]\\
\operatorname{D_{x}^{v - 1}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] &= \operatorname{D_{x}^{w - 1}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] + c_{-1}\\
\operatorname{D_{x}^{v - 2}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] &= \operatorname{D_{x}^{w - 1}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] + c_{-2} + c_{-1} \cdot x\\
&\cdots\\
\operatorname{D_{x}^{v - w}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] &= y\left( x \right) + \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{w}\left[ c_{-k} \cdot x^{k} \right] \tag{3.1.2}\\
\end{align*}
$$ So $y\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{w}\left[ c_{-k} \cdot x^{k} \right] + \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{\left| v \right|}\left[ c_{2 \cdot k} \cdot \exp\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \cdot \cos\left( \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) + c_{2 \cdot k + 1} \cdot \exp\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \cdot \sin\left( \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \right]$ aka $y\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{w}\left[ c_{-k} \cdot x^{k} \right] + \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{v - w}\left[ c_{2 \cdot k} \cdot \exp\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \cdot \cos\left( \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) + c_{2 \cdot k + 1} \cdot \exp\left( \cos\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \cdot \sin\left( \sin\left( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \pi}{v - w} \right) \cdot x \right) \right] \tag{3.1.3}$ . Which would be one possible form that $y$ could take to be defined and thus be defined for a given $f$ . Another way to satisfy the condition is that we solve the inequality $\operatorname{D_{x}^{z}}\left[ y\left( x \right) \right] \ne 0$ . But we have already solved that for $z = w$ (a similar equation), see Formula $\left( 3.1.2 \right)$ , with: $$y\left( x \right) \ne \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{z}\left[ c_{-k} \cdot x^{k} \right] \tag{3.1.4}$$ But that's obvious, 'since every finite polynomial is no solution.","['power-towers', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4677380,"Probability of drawing a red ball before a blue ball, after already drawing the first blue ball","Given we have $20$ balls in a bucket: $4$ blue, $4$ red, rest are all white. We draw randomly from the bucket without replacement until we see the first blue ball. Now we continue drawing. Which is more likely to happen first - seeing a red ball, or seeing another blue ball? Now, I did some simulations and the answer seems to be that both are equally likely to happen. But I'm having trouble seeing this mathematically. My thought process is as follows: After the first blue ball is drawn, the probability of drawing a red or another blue ball first is determined by how many red and blue balls are left in the bucket. Now, obviously there are only $3$ blue balls left. But the expected number of red balls left are $3\frac{1}{5}$ . This is because, as shown below, , we can think of the order of us drawing balls as a permutation of the balls, and so each of the red ball have equal likelihood of being placed in one of the red slots, and so expected number of red ball in each red slot is $4/5$ , and thus the expected number of red balls after the first ""B"" is $4/5*4 = 3\frac{1}{5}$ . So we are expecting more red balls than blue balls remaining in the bucket. Then shouldn't that mean we have higher probability of draw red ball first before anothehr blue ball?","['conditional-probability', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

One has 14 white and 32 black balls, another has 23 white and 43 black balls. Choosing a box randomly, we choose a white ball. What is a probability, that from the same box we will choose a white ball again? My solution: In general, there are 46 balls in the first box, and 66 box in the second one. There is a condition, that we already chose a white ball and we gonna choose from the same box white ball. So, to choose a ball from the first box again, we have a probability: $$\frac{14-1}{46-1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$ and from the second box: $$\frac{23-1}{66-1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$ I know, that If I sum these two probabilities the result will be wrong because I did not specify a condition.

For the first one. I am pretty sure that it holds, as the heuristic is telling us: on LHS ""I know"" $X_1$ and on the RHS ""I know"" $X_1$ up to a known constant. For the second one: the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[X_2|X_1]$ is $\sigma(X_1)$ -measurable, i.e. $$ \sigma(\mathbb{E}[X_2|X_1]) \subset \sigma(X_1)$$ and it can be written as $f(X_1)$ a.s., where $f$ is Borel measurable.

Each student can pass only to the immediate neighbour left, right, in front or behind. One possible path is shown. How many different paths can Felix take from Alex to Bryn? So what confuses me about this question is typically this style of ""how many paths"" gives a more limited direction, e.g. only right and up towards the target. However, in this question, the students can pass left, right, in front, and behind.

Is there an algorithm that takes $x \in \mathbb{R}$ as input and decides whether $x$ belongs to $B$ ?
The algorithm is allowed to make queries of the form ""Compare $x$ to $y$ "" for $y\in\mathbb{R}$ . The result of such a query is one of $<$ , $=$ and $>$ . Note that $B$ is arbitrary but fixed. It is not part of the input of the algorithm. If $B$ is open, such an algorithm exists: First we can find an integer $T$ such that $|x|\leq T$ . Then it remains to decide whether or not $x$ belongs to one of finitely many open intervals. Note that my notion of an algorithm is allowed to have real numbers as variables and perform arithmetic operations on them. My notion of an algorithm is also allowed to have a pre-computed infinite sequence of real values in memory (for my example where $B$ is open, I'm assuming that the endpoints of the intervals whose union is $B$ are stored in memory before the algorithm starts running, in a convenient order).

I can see it has no roots and therefore no linear factors, so it must either factor as the product of a quadratic and a quartic or two cubics, but listing the irreducible quadratics and cubics mod $5$ is laborious.

x^6+x+1 = (x^3+ax^2+bx+c)(x^3+dx^2+ex+f)

Hence i feel like $G$ is the free product $\mathbb{Z} \star C_2$ where $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2. It appears that my intuition is probably false as a similar reasoning would lead to say that it is also the free group $\mathbb{Z}\star C_3$ .

I know that specifying $f$ on the boundary in full, in terms of a continuous function, determines the solution entirely as the harmonic function given by Poisson's formula $$f(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos(\theta-t)+r^2}f(\cos t,\sin t) \mathrm{d}t. $$ However, I'm not sure what happens when only a select few boundary values are provided. In summary, I want to solve the following optimization problem: $$\operatorname{argmin} _f\iint_{x_1^2+x_2^2\leq 1} \|\nabla f(x_1,x_2)\|^2 \mathrm{d}x_1 \mathrm{d}x_2\\ s.t. f(\cos(t_n),\sin(t_n))=y_n, \quad 1 \leq n \leq N. $$ My attempt: Obviously if there is only one constraint $f(\mathbf{x}_1)=y_1$ the solution is the constant function $f(x_1,x_2) \equiv y_1$ . I've also managed to express the Dirichlet energy in smaller disks as a quadratic form of the boundary values: $$E_R[f]=\iint_{D_R(\mathbf{0})} \|\nabla f\|^2 \mathrm{d}A = \frac{1}{4\pi^2} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{4 \pi R^2 \left( (1+R^4) \cos(t_1-t_2)-2R^2 \right)}{\left(1-2R^2 \cos(t_1-t_2)+R^4\right)^2} f(\cos t_1, \sin t_1) f(\cos t_2, \sin t_2)\mathrm{d}t_1 \mathrm{d}t_2. $$ Here $0 \leq R < 1$ , and unfortunately a straightforward limit $R \to 1$ appears to make the integral divergent. Letting $$K(t_1-t_2):=\frac{1}{4 \pi^2} \frac{4 \pi R^2 \left( (1+R^4) \cos(t_1-t_2)-2R^2 \right)}{\left(1-2R^2 \cos(t_1-t_2)+R^4\right)^2},$$ I computed the variational derivative with respect to $f$ and found the condition $$\int_0^{2\pi} K(\tau-t) f(\cos t, \sin t) \equiv 0, \quad \text{ for all } \tau.$$ I am stuck here as I don't know how to use the constraints in this variational approach. Any help on solving the problem with more than 1 constraint would be greatly appreciated.

4678700,Does there exist an infinite set admitting precisely four linear orders?,"I am studying a course on ZF Set Theory where I encountered the following question: Does there exist a set admitting precisely four linear orders? Since any set with $n$ elements exhibits $n!$ linear orders, it feels obvious to conclude that there does not exist such a set since $n! \neq 4$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (certainly not a finite set). However, I was wondering if there is a proof (or counterexample) for the claim that is more rigorous than this observation. The question seemed to be posed as more than just a trivial consequence of this fact and so I am assuming that I have oversimplified the problem and that if I broaden my consideration to infinite sets, then it becomes potentially a lot more tricky to conclude that the statement is incorrect in such a simple manner. I would be grateful for any clarity here. Further Thoughts Having now entertained the possibility of constructing infinite sets that exhibit precisely four linear orders, I have tentatively come up with an example that I think might work ( edit: this does not work). Perhaps if we define the set $$X := \mathbb{Z} \times \{ 1,2,3,4 \}$$ Then we can define the following four linear orders: $$ \text{Order 1: $(a, i) <_1 (b, j)$ if and only if $a < b$ or ($a = b$ and $i < j$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 2: $(a, i) <_2 (b, j)$ if and only if $a > b$ or ($a = b$ and $i < j$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 3: $(a, i) <_3 (b, j)$ if and only if $i < j$ or ($i = j$ and $a < b$)}$$ $$ \text{Order 4: $(a, i) <_4 (b, j)$ if and only if $i < j$ or ($i = j$ and $a > b$)}$$ However, I am hesitant to accept this as an answer without first showing that these are indeed the only four possible linear orders here (since the question requires that there are precisely four). It's certainly the case that four is a lower bound here, but how do I show that there are no others (if indeed this is the case)? Edit The above example is not correct. Please refer to the answer I have produced below for the reason why that is the case.

My reference text (Achim Klenke's Probability Theory: A Comprehensive Course , 3rd ed., Exercise 15.1.5ii) recommends taking $Y_\sigma$ to be independent of $X$ and uniformly distributed on $[1-\sigma, \sigma]$ . This doesn't satisfy 2, though: if $X = 1$ almost surely, or if $X$ is supported on a Cantor set, then $XY_\sigma$ doesn't have a continuous density. Is a construction like this possible?

f_\sigma(y) = \begin{cases}

-\sigma^{-2}(y-\sigma-1) & \textrm{if } 1 < y \leq 1+\sigma \\

In fact, doing some simple change of variables yields: $$\left(\left (\int_0^\cdot  \nabla u(\tau,x)d\tau\right ) * \nabla v(\cdot,x) \right)(T) = \left(\left (\int_0^\cdot  \nabla v(\tau,x)d\tau\right ) * \nabla u(\cdot,x) \right)(T)$$ This also shows that as soon as $A$ is not constant in time, symmetry cannot be expected. Yet, the authors of this very short paper seem to claim this is the case, in the first page. Can anyone confirm that the this convolution-based formulation in non-symmetric in the general case, even if $u,v,A$ are taken as continuous piecewise linear functions in time?

Notes I have decided to use a linear heat equation, which one would obtain after linearization of the formulation in the linked paper my point I think could be made with ODEs directly, the space variable does not play a role here. I decided to keep it to mantain a certain similarity with the above paper Context Solving the heat equation with a space-time method, naturally yields non-symmetric linear systems to be solved, because of the presence of the time derivative. However, applying the convolution operator, one could hope to make those systems symmetric (albeit dense).

4679118,Does a completely metrizable space admit a compatible metric where all intersections of nested closed balls are non-empty?,"It is well-known that given a metric space $(X,d)$ , the metric is complete if and only if every intersection of nested (i.e. decreasing with respect to inclusion) closed balls of vanishing diameters have non-empty intersection. This is usually referred to as Cantor's Intersection Theorem. My question basically is: Is it true that every completely metrizable topological space admits one compatible metric such that every intersection of nested closed balls has a non-empty intersection? I will give some more details: Let's call spherically complete a metric as above where every intersection of nested closed balls has non-empty intersection. I'm very aware that not every complete metric is spherically complete. Only on this forum, there are several discussions on similar topics (see e.g. this question and the list of its related questions). However, my question is not about a fixed metric, but about the existence of one single compatible metric for a topological space.
And a priori, it seems possible to me that even a metric space whose metric is not spherically complete may still admit another compatible spherically complete metric. We know that there exist spaces that have spherically complete metrics. For example: All (complete) metrics on a compact space are spherically complete. The standard euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}$ is spherically complete. All completely ultrametrizable spaces admit a compatible spherically complete metric. I suspect that every locally compact completely metrizable space admits a spherically complete metric, and probably the same is true for Polish spaces (using that they are homeomorphic to $G_\delta$ subsets of the Hilbert cube).
But I could not find any reference for this. So to be more precise my question is: Do all completely metrizable topological spaces admit a compatible spherically complete metric? If not, is it known what is the largest class of (completely metrizable) topological spaces that admit one? Even an answer/reference only for locally compact or Polish spaces would be nice.

Of course, strong continuity implies weak continuity, and in finite dimension weak continuity implies strong continuity too (it suffices to write $f =: (f_1, f_2, \dots, f_d)$ and to remember that $f$ is continuous iff the $f_k$ s are), but there are functions that are weakly continuous everywhere but not strongly continuous in one point: this post for example features such a function (they chose to make the function go from a domain of $\mathbb{C}$ there but it's very much adaptable to an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ ). and I feel like it should not be hard to have countably many discontinuities by summing countably many functions that are each weakly continuous everywhere and strongly continuous everywhere except in one point each. On the other hand, the existence of nowhere (strongly) continuous functions is guaranteed, for example by picking any non-linear solution of the Cauchy functional equation $g(x+y) = g(x) + g(y)$ and a vector $x$ in $X$ , and then taking $f : t \in [0,1] \mapsto g(t)x \in X$ , and you can probably take Hamel bases of $\mathbb{R}$ and $X$ and make an example with an infinite-dimensional range $f : \sum_i t_i e_i\mapsto \sum_i g(t_i)e'_i$ , but it's hard to see whether those highly irregular functions can make place for a weakly continuous function... As such this got me wondering how ""badly"" can weak continuous functions behave in regards to strong continuity, and as such here is my question: Question : Does there exist $X$ an infinite-dimensional Banach space such that there exists an everywhere weakly continuous yet nowhere strongly continuous function $f : [0,1] \to X$ ?

Define $S$ to be the set of convex combinations of $x_i$ with dyadic rational coefficients, and define $a \cdot b = \frac{a + b}{2}$ .

 y/\partial \bar{y})+(\partial f/\partial z)(\partial z/\partial
 \bar{y})$ , and the analogous formula for $\partial f/\partial
 \bar{z}$ . We know that $\bar{y}=y\cos{\phi}+z\sin{\phi}$ and $\bar{z}=-y\sin{\phi}+z\cos{\phi}$ ; ""solve"" these equations for $y$ and $z$ (as functions of $\bar{y}$ and $\bar{z}$ ), and compute the
needed derivatives $\partial y/\partial\bar{y}$ , $\partial
 z/\partial\bar{y}$ , etc. The cited equation 1.29 is a matrix equation for transforming coordinates in one set of axes to coordinates in another set of axes that is rotated by $\phi$ radians relative to the first coordinates. $$\begin{pmatrix}
\overline{y}\\ \overline{z}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}\tag{1}$$ From the hint, it seems we are asked to figure out what $\partial f/\partial\bar{y}$ and $\partial f/\partial\bar{z}$ are, and to verify that they satisfy the relationship $$\begin{pmatrix}
\partial f/\partial\bar{y}\\ \partial f/\partial\bar{z}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
\partial f/\partial y\\ \partial f/\partial z
\end{pmatrix}\tag{2}$$ That is, $$\overline{\nabla f}=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi}
\end{pmatrix}\nabla f\tag{3}$$ If these two vectors do satisfy this relationship, then it means that they behave as expected under the rotation transformation. But what is happening at the linear algebra level here? My first question is: what do $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{y}}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{z}}$ mean exactly? The square matrix, let's call it $R$ , in (1) is the transformation. The columns are the coordinates of the transformed standard basis vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ , namely $R\hat{i}$ and $R\hat{j}$ , and these form a basis for the range of the transformation. If we stick the gradient vector on the right hand side of (1) we are transforming the vector and obtaining coordinates in the new basis. This happens by taking the same linear combination used with the old basis, but now with the new basis. As far as I can tell $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{y}}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{z}}$ are technically the partial derivatives of $f$ under the new basis (that is, if we were to figure out what $f(\overline{y},\overline{z})$ is). Thus, what (3) says is that this new gradient turns out to have the same coordinates under the new basis as under the old basis, which is how all vectors behave under a linear transformation (is this correct?). That is, by showing (3) we are showing that gradients are just regular ol' vectors like any others in its vector space. My second question is: why, ex ante, would there be a possibility that these two vectors would not satisfy this relationship? Here are the calculations I did to accomplish this task Let $$g(\overline{y}, \overline{z})=f(y(\overline{y}, \overline{z}),z(\overline{y}, \overline{z}))$$ That is, $f$ as a function of coordinates in the new basis. $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial \overline{y}}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{y}}\tag{4}$$ $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial \overline{z}}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}\tag{5}$$ Therefore, if we can find these partial derivatives of $g$ we will have found $\overline{\nabla f}$ , and we hope that this is an expression in terms of $\nabla f$ . Using the chain rule, we have $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial \overline{y}}=\nabla f(y(\overline{y},\overline{z}),z(\overline{y},\overline{z}))\cdot \left ( \frac{\partial y}{\partial\overline{y}}\hat{i} +\frac{\partial z}{\partial\overline{y}}\hat{j} \right )\tag{6}$$ $$=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \overline{y}}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial \overline{y}}\tag{7}$$ Similarly, $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial \overline{z}}=\nabla f(y(\overline{y},\overline{z}),z(\overline{y},\overline{z}))\cdot \left ( \frac{\partial y}{\partial\overline{z}}\hat{i} +\frac{\partial z}{\partial\overline{z}}\hat{j} \right )\tag{8}$$ $$=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \overline{z}}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial \overline{z}}\tag{9}$$ Note that we know $\overline{y}(y,z)$ and $\overline{z}(y,z)$ because this is given by (1), but we don't know $y(\overline{y},\overline{z})$ or $z(\overline{y},\overline{z})$ . This is why we need to solve for $y$ and $z$ in (1), and when we do this we obtain $$y=-\overline{z}\sin{\phi}+\overline{y}\cos{\phi}$$ $$z=\overline{y}\sin{\phi}+\overline{z}\cos{\phi}$$ From which we can compute $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial\overline{y}}=\cos{\phi}$$ $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial\overline{z}}=-\sin{\phi}$$ $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial\overline{y}}=\sin{\phi}$$ $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial\overline{z}}=\cos{\phi}$$ and plugging these into (7) and (9) we obtain $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{y}}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\cos{\phi}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\sin{\phi}\tag{7}$$ $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{z}}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(-\sin{\phi})+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\cos{\phi}\tag{7}$$ Thus, we have shown by direct computation of the partial derivatives that (2) and (3) are true.","['vector-fields', 'multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-analysis']"
4679448,Where are the other Pythagorean Theorems?,"One way to prove the Pythagorean Theorem is by noticing that its altitude divides it into two pieces similar to itself. The theorem immediately follows from the fact that areas scale with the square of the ratio and the ratios are determined by the sides of the big triangle. The thing about this proof is that it doesn't seem to have anything to do with triangles. Wouldn't any family of shapes that can be - non- trivially - divided into similar copies of itself yield a similar result? The condition for a non-trivial division is inspired by the fact that any triangle or parallelogram can be divided into four congruent copies of itself, but this division doesn't lead to any interesting equation. I'm not sure what formal condition makes a division trivial, though. One could argue that the $(\sqrt 2:1)$ parallelogram can be non trivially divided into two similar copies of itself. However, we can't really obtain any equation from it, since there is no degree of freedom on its sides. Could it be that the right triangles consist of the only interesting family? Is the Pythagorean Theorem really that special? Update 1: I just came across this article , which surprisingly proves that any polygon that can be divided into two similar copies of itself must be similar to one of the following: As the parallelogram, the Golden Bee do not give us any equation. This already implies that the Pythagorean Theorem is, if not the only one, the simpler of its kind. But that is not taking fractals into account: Update 2: As told in a comment, a rep-tile is a polygon that decomposes into congruent copies of itself. Also, an irreptile (irregular rep-tile) is a polygon that decomposes into similar copies of itself (those are the interesting ones). Searching for these terms led to some interesting places: This site gives some examples of irreptiles and discuss some results around them. In this presentation you can see lots of irreptiles to fire the imagination. This article gets into methods to build some irreptiles families. Looking through those I had the impression that we won't get any interesting equation from a irreptile if it is divided into many pieces more then its number of sides. That being said, the following shape called my attention: This one leads to the equation $a^2+2b^2 = c^2$ . However, this seems to be, again, a rigid shape, so we can't really choose $a$ and $b$ .","['euclidean-geometry', 'combinatorics', 'geometry']"

However, when I tried to calculate the definite integral using Desmos, I obtained two different answers.
First, I directly entered the equation in the form $\int_{0}^{2\pi}f\left(x\right)dx$ , and I got a non-zero answer $(0.658656788383)$ . Then, I entered $F(2\pi) - F(0)$ , and this time, I got the answer $0$ . Finally, I plotted $y = f(x)$ , and saw that for all points, $y > 0$ , which means the definite integral couldn't be zero. I'm confused about why Desmos is giving me different answers for the same integral, and I'm not sure which one is correct. Is this a problem with Desmos, or is there an error in my calculations? I've double-checked my integration and the antiderivative, and I believe they are correct. Could there be some issue in my way of applying the limits?

Because of the recursive nature of the series, one can write the following: $$f(x)=\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+...}}}}\Longleftrightarrow f(x)=\sqrt{x+f(x)}$$ Hence, treating $f(x)$ as the unknown element of the equation yields: $$f^2(x)-f(x)-x=0$$ And consequently solving for $f(x)$ : $$\Delta=1^2+4x\Longrightarrow f_1(x)=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}\wedge f_2(x)=\frac{1-\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}$$ Only one of these definitions is in fact correct, considering all outputs of the function have to be positive and remarking that, on $\mathbb{R}^+$ : $$1\leq1+4x\Longleftrightarrow f_2(x)\leq0\ \ \forall x\in\mathbb{R}^+$$ Leaving us with the only possible conclusion that: $$f(x)=\frac{1+\sqrt{1+4x}}{2}$$ My question is as to how rigorous this proof is.

4680307,Continuous functions in Sobolev spaces,"Let $W^{k,p} (\Omega)$ be a Sobolev space, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ . Formally, $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ consists of equivalence classes of functions with finite Sobolev norm. Two functions, $f$ and $g$ , are said to be equivalent ('equal') if $\Vert f-g \Vert_{W^{k,p}} =0$ . In many proofs concerning Sobolev functions, say, PoincarÃ© inequality, one first shows the claim for smooth functions and then generalises by using the fact that smooth functions $C_0^{\infty} (\Omega)$ are dense in $W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$ . However, it is unclear to me what is meant by writing $u \in C_0^{\infty}(\Omega)$ . Does it mean that $u$ is equivalent to a smooth function (in the $W^{1,2}$ sense) or that $u$ is itself a smooth function? One proof for PoincarÃ© inequality on $\Omega:=(a, b)\subset \mathbb{R}$ starts by writing the value of $u \in C_0^{\infty}(a, b)$ as $$ u(x)=\int_a^x u dx+u(a),Â $$ however, if $u$ is considered to be a Sobolev function, one cannot talk about its point wise values, $u(a)$ in particular. Or is it some kind of an agreement that $u(a)$ is the value of the smooth function to which $u$ is equivalent (in $W^{1,2}$ )? Another confusion arises when talking about the trace operator. In the Wiki page , it is said that the trace $T: W^{1,p}(\Omega) \rightarrow L^p (\partial \Omega)$ is such that $Tu = u\mid_{\partial \Omega}$ for any $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega) \cap C(\overline{\Omega})$ . Again, $W^{1,p}$ consist of equivalence classes whereas $C(\overline{\Omega})$ consists of functions. So does the intersection mean functions with finite Sobolev norm which are equivalent to some continuous function? And is $u\mid_{\partial \Omega}$ the boundary function of $u$ , or the set of functions equivalent to it?","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces', 'trace-map', 'functional-analysis']"
4680314,Dealing with variables in multivariable limit questions,"I am trying to solve the question below. My initial approach was to look at the limit along the x and y axis which both yield 0. Now, I moved on to look at the limit along the path of y = mx.
When I did this, i noticed that I had to fix my x and substitute y for mx instead of saying x = y/m and y = mx. When I did the latter, I ended up going in circles and it produced the original equation. My question is, why do I need to fix the x value? What is the mathematical reasoning?","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'problem-solving']"
4680318,When does every automorphism of a ring of continuous functions come from an automorphism of the space?,"In recent days I am studying rings of continuous functions and I was wondering whether the following is true: Let $X$ be a topological space that is Tychonoff (that is, $X$ is completely regular and $T_{1}$ ) and $C(X)$ be the ring of all real valued continuous functions on $X$ . Now, if $F: X \rightarrow X$ be a homeomorphism (with respect to the same topology on $X$ ), then there is a ring isomorphism $G: C(X) \rightarrow C(X)$ given by $G(f) = f \circ F$ for all $f \in C(X)$ . Now, my question is the following: if $G': C(X) \rightarrow C(X)$ be any ring isomorphism, then does there exist a homeomorphism $F': X \rightarrow X$ (with respect to the same topology on $X$ ) such that $G'(f) = f \circ F'$ for all $f \in C(X)$ ? If not, then for which topological spaces $X$ the statement is true? If $X$ is completely regular, then all real-valued continuous functions on $X$ determine the topology of $X$ . My question is somewhat different and that can be seen from the question.","['continuity', 'general-topology']"
