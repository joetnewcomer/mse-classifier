Prove that $9$ divides $|G|$. My attempt - Let $a$ and $b$ be the elements of $G$, such that $|a| = |b| = 3$. 
Then 
$$\{ 1,a,a^2,b,b^2,ab,ab^2,a^2b,a^2b^2 \}$$
is a subgroup of $G$. And, by applying Lagrange's theorem we get $9 \mid |G|$. Doubt - 
What is the significance of having at least three elements of order $3$? In the group constructed above there are more than three elements of order $3$. Any hints or suggestions will be appreciated.","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

2822596,Understanding solution to probability problem,"I came across following problem A basketball team consists of 6 frontcourt and 4 backcourt players. If players are divided into roommates at random, what is the probability that there will be exactly two roommate pairs made up of a backcourt and a frontcourt player? I solved the problem and checked the final solution given. I was wrong. After giving a bit of thought I realized I solved it stupidly. However I was not able to solve it again correctly. So I went through the full description given in the answer. But I was not able to understand it either. There are $(10)!/2^5$ different divisions of the 10 players into a first roommate pair, a second roommate pair, and so on. Hence, there are $(10)!/(5!2^5)$ divisions into 5 roommate pairs. There are $\binom{6}{2}\binom{4}{2}$ ways of choosing the frontcourt and backcourt
  players to be in the mixed roommate pairs, and then 2 ways of pairing them up. As there is then 1 way to pair up the remaining two backcourt, and $4!/(2!2^2) = 3$ ways of making two roommate pairs from the remaining four frontcourt players, we see that the desired probability is $$P(\text{2 mixed pairs})=\frac{\binom{6}{2}\binom{4}{2}(2)(3)}{(10)!/(5!2^5)}=.5714$$ I was not able to understand following sentences There are $(10)!/2^5$ different divisions of the 10 players into a first roommate pair, a second roommate pair, and so on. Hence, there are $(10)!/(5!2^5)$ divisions into 5 roommate pairs. $4!/(2!2^2) = 3$ ways of making two roommate pairs from the remaining four frontcourt players Both seem to follow same logic, but seems that either I was never came across it or its something simple but I am stupidly not able to get it.","['combinatorics', 'probability']"
2822611,Pullback of the Frobenius map and function fields extension,"We know that for two nonsingular projective algebraic curves defined over a field $\mathbf{k}$, there is a bijection between nonconstant morphisms $h: C \to C'$ and function fields injections $h^* : \mathbf{k}(C') \to \mathbf{k}(C)$, where $h^*G = G \circ h$.
Also, if $C$ is defined over $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p$, the Frobenius map on $C$ is 
$$ \sigma_p : C \to C^{\sigma_p}, \quad [x_0:\dots:x_n] \mapsto [x_0^p:\dots:x_n^p]. $$ Now, the example I'm looking at is $C = \mathbf{P}^1(\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p)$, with $\sigma_p(t) = t^p$ on the affine part. Diamond and Shurman say that this gives the extension of function fields $\mathbf{F}_p(t)/\mathbf{F}_p(s)$, where $s = t^p$ and this is what I don't understand. Why is the function field $\mathbf{K}$ of $C$ not $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p(t)$, and how does one get $\mathbf{F}_p(s)$ for the function field of $C^{\sigma_p}$? Do we need to compute the function field explicitly or the preimage of the pullback map $\sigma_p^*$ instead? I would guess the second but it's not very clear to me how this is done exactly.","['algebraic-curves', 'extension-field', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2822669,Is there/can there be a model-theoretic proof of this theorem of arithmetic ?,"I read on MO that if an integer $a$ is a square mod $p$ for sufficiently large primes $p$, then $a$ is a square. Now that's a statement that looks awfully like a Lefschetz-principle-type statement; and so I'm wondering whether there'd be a model-theoretic proof. It could start as follow: fix such an $a$;  let $T$ be a theory looking like the theory of rings + $\exists x, (x^2 = 1+...+1)  \land P(x)$ (there are $a$ $1$'s) + for all $p$, $char \neq p$; where $P$ is a nice formula expressing something that looks like ""$x$ is an integer"". One reason this might work is that for instance $\mathbb{N}$ is definable in $(\mathbb{Q},+,\times)$, and so we may expect that such a ""nice"" formula $P$ may exist. With a bit of luck, using compactness would then allow us to conclude. Of course I haven't done much here, I just threw a bunch of ideas but it's mostly because I don't see how to do better for the moment. So my question is : Is there a known model-theoretic proof of this fact? Has one ever been attempted ? Are there number-theoretic obstructions to the existence of such a proof ?

My understanding is that, in this system, the same $v$ above has the coordinate $v = (-1/2, 5/2)$. Let $T: R^2 \rightarrow R^2$, $T(x,y) = (x+2y, 3x - 2y)$. With $B_1$,

and $D_1f(0,0)= D_2f(0,0) = 0$. The function is differentiable at $(0,0)$ with $f'(\vec{0}) = [0,0]$, since we can verify that: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{|f(x,y)|}{\|\vec{x}\|} & = \frac{|x||y|^3}{x^4+y^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \frac{|x||y|}{\frac{x^4}{y^2} + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \frac{|x||y|}{\left( \frac{x^2}{y} \right)^2 + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\|\vec{x}\|} \\

If $y$ is the generic point of $Y$, then $f^{\#}_y:\mathcal O_{C,c}\to \mathcal O_{X,y}$ If $\mathfrak p$ is the local equation of $y$ at $x$ then $\mathcal O_{X,y}=(\mathcal O_{X,x})_{\mathfrak p}$.

2822763,Definition of arbitrary functions and their existence.,"While trying to understand set theory from categorical perspective i.e. elementary theory of category of sets (Thanks to Lawvere), I am confronted with the situation where I need to construct arbitrary functions between two sets. Up until now following axioms are considered: $\exists $ terminal object $1$. $\exists$ initial object $0$. $\nexists 1\rightarrow 0$ 1 is a separator. Binary sum object exists for any two sets $A, B$. One of the properties that we expect of sum object is that of exhaustivity. In general, following definition of exhaustivity of sum can be given. Definition Let $C$ be a category, $S$ be sum of objects $A$ and $B$ with inclusion maps $i_A:A\rightarrow S$ and $i_B:B\rightarrow S$. Sum is said to be exhaustive iff $\forall$ objects $T\in C, \forall t_1, t_2:S\rightarrow T$ $$[(t_1\circ i_A=t_2\circ i_A) \wedge (t_1\circ i_B=t_2\circ i_B)]\Rightarrow (t_1=t_2)$$ That sum is exhaustive (1) in general follows from only the definition of sum. Please let me know, if you need to see proof of this. But in category of sets, we expect more of exhaustivity: $$\forall s:1\rightarrow S, s\subseteq i_A \vee s\subseteq i_B \ \ \ \ (2)$$ Where $\subseteq$ is defined as follows: Let $s_1:S_1\hookrightarrow A$ and $s_2:S_2\hookrightarrow A$. $s_1\subseteq s_2 \equiv \exists w:S_1\rightarrow S_2$ such that $s_2\circ w=s_1$. An observation :
 (2) seems to be connected to (1). As if (2) is false, then that using the notion of arbitrary mappings, one can construct two mappings from sum object to an object with at least 2 points such that these mapping differ at only one point of sum object and that point is the one that is not included in any of the inclusion maps. Now, inclusion maps, in contradiction to (1), cannot differentiate these mappings. But, existence of such  mappings/functions seems to be not guaranteed by the 5 axioms stated in the beginning. But this could be introduced as follows: Definition of a function : A definition of a function (Lets call it $f$) comprises of following: A definition of its domain: $dom(f)$. A definition of its codomain: $cod(f)$. $\forall e:1\rightarrow dom(f)$, a defintion of $f\circ e$. Function $f$ is said to be a 'defined function'. Now one can state an axiom which stipulates existence of all defined function. Axiom of existence of defined functions Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a defined function. $f$ exists iff $\forall a:1\rightarrow$, $\exists! b:1\rightarrow B$ such that $f\circ a = b$. Now my question is basically this, is there any other way of ensuring existence of arbitrary mappings in this category of sets? Please note, I am beginner of the beginners learning what I like. So, I ask another more general question pertaining to studying: The axiom of existence of defined function seems to be an obvious one (and also an elegant one). But, I am also aware of Lawvere and Rosebrugh's book 'Sets for Mathematics', where they use intuition of arbitrary mappings as a guide rather than as an axiom. Why is that? While trying to learn something, is it better to start with what is obvious, and hope that upon their study and observation, we will be lead to other further non-obvious, perhaps, equivalent or more general axioms, which can replace the previous ones? I agree that this is certainly more an opinion based question, but in any case, I certainly see it as helpful to others like me who are confused when learning things. However, if you do not want to share any opinion, I understand. No worries. Thank you in advance for your attention and valuable time that you gave it to my small modest question.","['category-theory', 'soft-question', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Then there is an isomorphism $\tau : F(\alpha) \to F'(\alpha')$ with $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha'$ and $\tau |_F = \sigma$. I am reading Patrick Morandi's Field and Galois Theory , and on page 34, he states and proves the following theorem, which is a special case of the Isomorphism Extension Theorem. Theorem 3.19. Let $\sigma : F \to F'$ be a field isomorphism, let $f(x) \in F[x]$ and let $\sigma(f) \in F'[x]$ be the corresponding polynomial over $F'$. Let $K$ be a splitting field of $f$ over $F$, and let $K'$ be a splitting field of $\sigma(f)$ over $F'$. Then there is an isomorphism $\tau : K \to K'$ with $\tau|_F = \sigma$. Furthermore, if $\alpha \in K$ and if $\alpha'$ is any root of $\sigma(\min(F,\alpha))$ in $K'$, then $\tau$ can be chosen so that $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha'$. Proof: We prove this by induction on $n = [K:F]$. If $n = 1$, then $f$ splits over $F$, and the result is trivial in this case. So, suppose that $n > 1$ and that the result is true for splitting fields of degree less than $n$. $\color{red}{\text{If $f$ splits over $F$, then the result is clear.}}$ If not, let $p(x)$ be a nonlinear irreducible factor of $f(x)$, $\color{blue}{\text{let $\alpha$ be a root of $p$,}}$ and let $\alpha'$ be a root of $\sigma(p)$. Set $L = F(\alpha)$ and $L' = F'(\alpha')$. Then $[L:F] > 1$, so $[K:L] < n$. By Lemma 3.17, there is a field isomorphism $\rho : L \to L'$ with $\rho(\alpha) = \alpha'$. Since $K$ is a splitting field over $L$ for $f(x)$ and $K'$ is a splitting field over $L'$ for $\sigma(f)$, by induction the isomorphism $\rho$ extends to an isomorphism $\tau : K \to K'$. The isomorphism $\tau$ is then an extension of $\sigma$ (and $\rho$), and $\tau(\alpha) = \rho(\alpha) = \alpha'$. $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$ My doubts are related to the highlighted parts in the proof: Upon assuming that $n = [K:F] > 1$, it is certain that $f$ cannot split over $F$, because then we would have $K = F \implies [K:F] = 1$. So, isn't the statement highlighted in red redundant? In the proof, $\alpha$ is taken to be a root of (an irreducible factor of) $f$, and $\alpha'$ a root of the corresponding polynomial. But in the statement of the theorem $\alpha$ is an arbitrary element of $K$. It doesn't seem to be obvious how to use the given proof to construct an isomorphism $K \to K'$ which sends this arbitrary $\alpha$ to an $\alpha'$.

$$|\mathbb{Q}(a,b):\mathbb{Q}| = |\mathbb{Q}(ab,b):\mathbb{Q}| = |\mathbb{Q}(ab)(a):\mathbb{Q}(ab)|\cdot |\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}|= n\cdot m $$ $\implies 1 = \frac{|\mathbb{Q}(a,b):\mathbb{Q}|}{|\mathbb{Q}(ab,a):\mathbb{Q}|} = \frac{n\cdot m}{|\mathbb{Q}(ab,a):\mathbb{Q}(ab)|\cdot |\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}|}\implies |Q(ab):\mathbb{Q}| = \frac{n\cdot m}{|\mathbb{Q}(ab,a):\mathbb{Q}(ab)|}$ Now, as $$|\mathbb{Q}(a):\mathbb{Q}|=n \implies \deg(\operatorname{irr}(a,\mathbb{Q}))=n$$ we have that $$\deg(\operatorname{irr}(a,\mathbb{Q}(ab)))\leq n\implies |\mathbb{Q}(ab,a):\mathbb{Q}(ab)|\leq n$$ Therefore $|\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}| = m\cdot \frac{n}{|\mathbb{Q}(ab,a):\mathbb{Q}(ab)|}= m \cdot k$, with $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. By the same logic $|\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}| = n \cdot t$, with $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ So $|\mathbb{Q}(a,b):\mathbb{Q}|$ is a multiple of $m$ and $n$, but as they are coprimes, the least commom multiple of them is their product, which is $mn = |\mathbb{Q}(a,b):\mathbb{Q}|$, and as $\mathbb{Q}(ab) \subset \mathbb{Q}(a,b), |\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}|\leq|\mathbb{Q}(a,b):\mathbb{Q}|$, so we have that $|\mathbb{Q}(ab):\mathbb{Q}|=mn$

2823105,Does the typical vector space of polynomials up to a certain degree need to have the constant vectors,"I helped a classmate with an exercise about sets of vectors spanning (or not) certain vector spaces. The question was as follows:
Does the set $$\{ t, t+t^2, t^3-3t^4, 2t-t^2, -4t^4-t^3 \}$$ span the space $$P_4$$ where this vector space was the polynomials with degree $\leq 4$. (where $t \in \mathbb{R}$) (this vector space is defined the way it usually is, with coordinates of a vector corresponding with the coefficients of a polynomial) I said yes because when you write the vectors as a $5$ by $4$ matrix you can use gaussian elimination to end up with 4 monomial vectors (by that I mean the vectors $(1,0,0,0)$ and so on which you would then use as the coefficients of a polynomial). This answer was wrong because the set does not include a constant vector. Which brings to me to my actual question as to why specifically this is.
As far as I have tried you could talk about a vector space of polynomials with degree $\leq k$ and no constant part just fine. I have tried finding where the vector space axioms don't work but I can't seem to find an error. So is there something I am overlooking where a vector space of polynomials without a constant part would not work? I understand it would be pretty strange since if you're talking about polynomials there is no reason to disregard constant polynomials, especially since they don't cause any problems here, but let's disregard that for a moment.

A motivating example; consider the first-order analogue $y' = e^y$, which has the solution: $$y = \ln\left(\frac{1}{c - x}\right)$$ If I wanted to transform this nonlinear ODE into a linear one, I might consider the following coordinate transformation, $y = \ln(z)$; doing so generates the following nonlinear (but algebraic) ODE for $z$: $$z' = z^2$$ Following up with another change of variables $z = w^{-1}$, we now find a linear ODE for $w$: $$w' = -1, \quad w = c - x$$ and the solution for $y$ can be found trivially by applying all the coordinate changes to the solution of the linear ODE.

Then, I realized that there was a (slightly, perhaps) more efficient way to write all letter combinations.

2823530,Can a function be analytic if it does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions,"I'm a student of electrical engineering, preparing for the theoretical exam covering complex analysis. I'm confused about the analyticity of a complex function, so I'm asking for clarification because our professor inadequately explained this concept. What I understand from my lecture notes: suppose there's a complex-valued function $f(z)$. Such function is analytic if the following conditions are satisfied: $f$ is differentiable at $z_0$, therefore $f'(z_0)$ exists $f$ is differential at every point of some $\epsilon$-spherical neighborhood of $z_0$ $f$ can be expanded as a Taylor series in the vicinity of $z_0$ At that point, Cauchy-Riemann equations are nowhere mentioned. However, I've found online that C-R equations are a necessary condition for a complex-valued function being holomorphic (or analytic, although terms are used interchangeably). And here's where I'm starting to get lost. If C-R equations are a necessary condition for holomorphicity, but they are not sufficient conditions for complex differentiability, then how can they ensure given function $f$ being holomorphic, if according to what I've read, such function must be differentiable at given point $z_0$ in order to be considered holomorphic? Can, therefore, a function be holomorphic (or analytic) if C-R conditions are not satisfied?

Suppose one considers the space $C$ of continuous functions $f:\mathopen [ 0,+\infty \mathclose [ \rightarrow Y$ where $Y$ is a complete metric space with metric $\rho \leqslant 1$. Define $d_n(f,g)=\sup \left \{\rho(f(x),g(x))| \  x\in \mathopen [ 0,n\mathclose ] \right \}$ for $f,g \in C$, then set $d\left ( f,g \right )= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {2^{-n}}d_n\left ( f,g \right )$. One proves: $d$ is a metric on $C$ that induces the topology of compact convergence. However, why is $d$ complete? Supposedly, this is a trivial matter - it never gets explained - but I don't see why.

2823623,Is there more to complex analysis than a two-dimensional potential theory?,"Wikipedia entry on Potential theory in two dimensions says the following From the fact that the group of conformal transforms is infinite-dimensional in two dimensions and finite-dimensional for more than two dimensions, one can surmise that potential theory in two dimensions is different from potential theory in other dimensions. This is correct and, in fact, when one realizes that any two-dimensional harmonic function is the real part of a complex analytic function, one sees that the subject of two-dimensional potential theory is substantially the same as that of complex analysis. For this reason, when speaking of potential theory, one focuses attention on theorems which hold in three or more dimensions. In this connection, a surprising fact is that many results and concepts originally discovered in complex analysis (such as Schwarz's theorem, Morera's theorem, the Weierstrass-Casorati theorem, Laurent series, and the classification of singularities as removable, poles and essential singularities) generalize to results on harmonic functions in any dimension. By considering which theorems of complex analysis are special cases of theorems of potential theory in any dimension, one can obtain a feel for exactly what is special about complex analysis in two dimensions and what is simply the two-dimensional instance of more general results. My question is, therefore: what exactly is special about complex analysis in two dimensions and what is simply the two-dimensional instance of more general results?","['complex-analysis', 'big-list', 'harmonic-functions', 'potential-theory']"

2823670,How does one construct general forms that certain variables in an equation must take?,"Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time $-$ the greatest in the $20^\text{th}$ century. One day, he stumbled across the equation $$\rm3^3+4^3+5^3=6^3\tag1$$ and only days later, he was able to discover the general form that this equation takes place in: $$\big(3a^2+5ab-5b^2\big)^3+\big(4a^2-4ab+6b^2\big)^3+\big(5a^2-5ab-3b^2\big)^3=\big(6a^2-4ab+4b^2\big)^3\tag2$$ for all integers $a$ and $b$, with Eq. $(1)$ being created when $a=1$ and $b=0$. Now I know that barely anyone knows how Ramanujan obtained his results $-$ but he did, and they are brilliant. My question is, are there any useful techniques or methods that I can learn so I may be able to pull something like finding Eq. $(2)$? What algorithms are there to discover some general equations? I was not convinced when I looked at it, so I evaluated, and the left hand side weighs the same as the right hand side. But are there any such algorithms at all? For example, $a^2-b^2$ looks like some regular expression, but just add in the clever substitution $ab - ab$ and then this happens: $$\begin{align}a^2-b^2&=a^2+ab-ab-b^2\\ &= a(a+b)-b(a+b) \\ &= (a+b)(a-b).\end{align}$$ So now when anybody says what $915^2-914^2$ is, I can say it right away: it is $915+914=1829$. How does anybody know to put such clever substitutions? When I was first given the problem to factorise $a^2-b^2$, I just did this: $$\begin{align}(a-b)^2&=a^2-2ab+b^2 \\ \Leftrightarrow a^2-b^2&=(a-b)^2 + 2ab - 2b^2 \\ &= (a-b)^2 + 2b(a-b) \\ &= (a-b)(a-b+2b) \\ &= (a+b)(a-b).\end{align}$$ I got the same result, but it was not as efficient as the first method. I want to become a great mathematician one day; I don't want to just tell my friends that I do math for a living $-$ I want to prove something, or make a theorem, especially if it involves prime numbers. What are some helpful algebraic formulae that I should know when it comes to constructing generalised equations and such? I know the quadratic and cubic formula... but that is it. For example: $$x^2 + 3y^2 = 7z^2.$$ These are the forms that $x$, $y$ and $z$ must take for integers $p$ and $s$: $$\begin{align}x&=2\big(3p^2+3ps-s^2\big) \\ y&=-3p^2+4ps+s^2 \\ z&=3p^2+s^2.\end{align}$$

2823758,Why is the topological definition of continuous the way it is?,"I was learning the definition of continuous as: $f\colon X\to Y$ is continuous if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every open $U\subseteq Y$ For me this translates to the following implication: IF $U \subseteq Y$ is open THEN $f^{-1}(U)$ is open however, I would have expected the definition to be the other way round, i.e. with the 1st implication I defined. The reason for that is that just by looking at the metric space definition of continuous: $\exists q = f(p) \in Y, \forall \epsilon>0,\exists \delta >0, \forall x \in X, 0 < d(x,p) < \delta \implies d(f(x),q) < \epsilon$ seems to be talking about Balls (i.e. open sets) in X and then has a forward arrow for open sets in Y, so it seems natural to expect the direction of the implication to go in that way round. However, it does not. Why does it not go that way? Whats is wrong with the implication going from open in X to open in Y? And of course, why is the current direction the correct one? I think conceptually I might be even confused why the topological definition of continuous requires to start from things in the target space Y and then require things in the domain. Can't we just say map things from X to Y and have them be close? Why do we require to posit things about Y first in either definition for the definition of continuous to work properly ? I can't help but point out that this question The definition of continuous function in topology seems to be similar but perhaps lack the detailed discussion on the direction on the implication for me to really understand why the definition is not reversed or what happens if we do reverse it. The second answer there tries to make an attempt at explaining why we require $f^{-1}$ to preserve the property of openness but its not conceptually obvious to me why thats the case or whats going on. Any help? For whoever suggest to close the question, the question is quite clear: why is the reverse implication not the ""correct"" definition of continuous? As an additional important point I noticed is, pointing out the difference between open mapping and continuous function would be very useful . Note: I encountered this in baby Rudin, so thats as far as my background in analysis goes, i.e. metric spaces is my place of understanding. Extra confusion/Appendix: Conceptually, I think I've managed to nail what my main confusion is. In conceptual terms continuous functions are suppose to map ""nearby points to nearby points"" so for me its metric space definition makes sense in that sense. However, that doesn't seem obvious to me unless we equate ""open sets"" to be the definition of ""close by"". Balls are open but there are plenty of sets that are open but are not ""close by"", for example the union of two open balls. I think this is what is confusing me most.

$$\Big|\text{num}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{c(k)}{k}\right)\Big|\le \Big|L\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{c(k)}{k}\Big|\le L\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{|c(k)|}{k}\le H_n\text{lcm}(1,\dots,n)$$
where $H_n$ is the $n$-th harmonic number. For some $n$, this bound is the best achievable, which can be seen when the denominator of $H_n$ truly is $\text{lcm}(1,\dots, n)$. Can any improvements be made or can this be shown to be the best bound for certain subsets of numbers? Another useful result would be the asymptotics of this, even if for only certain subsets.

  $$
p(n,m)\le\frac{1}{m!}\binom{n+\binom{m+1}{2}-1}{m-1}

  where $p(n, m)$ denotes the number of partitions of $n$ into exactly $m$ parts. The above question is from Comtet's Advanced Combinatorics. My Attempt I was able to show the inequality
$$
p_{d}(n,m)\leq\frac{1}{m!}\binom{n-1}{m-1}\leq p(n,m)\tag{0}
$$
where $p_{d}(n,m)$ denotes the number of partitions of $n$ into $m$ distinct parts. I provide a proof of the inequality at the end. Now write $p_{d}(n,m)=p(n-\binom{m+1}{2}, \leq m)=\sum_{k=0}^m p(n-\binom{m+1}{2}, k)$ but applying the inequality on each of the summands yields a lower bound of $p(n,m)$. Any help is appreciated. Proof of Inqequality (0) Here is a proof of $(0)$. Indeed, consider the map $\varphi\colon C(n,m )\to P(n,m)$ which sends a composition of $n$ into $m$ parts $(x_{1}, \dotsc, x_{m})$ to the partition obtained by arranging the components in descending order. Then
$$
p_{d}(n,m)=\frac{1}{m!}c_{d}(n,m)\leq\frac{1}{m!}\binom{n-1}{m-1}
$$
since the map $\varphi $ is $m!$ to one on the compositions of $n$ into $m$ distinct parts. and $c_d(n,m)$ denotes the compositions of $n$ into $m$ distinct parts. Similarly, 
$$
\frac{1}{m!}\binom{n-1}{m-1}=p_{d}(n,m)+\frac{c_{\text{notdist}}(n,m)}{m!}\leq p(n,m)

since the map $\varphi$ is less than $m!$ to one on the ""not distinct"" partitions.","['combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients', 'integer-partitions', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2824169,Spectrum of the commutative ring of $R$-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space,"In Atiyah and Macdonald chapter 1, it is an exercise to prove the following: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $C(X)$ be the commutative ring of $\mathbb{R}$-valued continuous functions on $X$. Then $\operatorname{Max}(C(X))$, the subspace of $\operatorname{Spec}(C(X))$ consisting of maximal ideals, is homeomorphic to $X$. An important step in this proof is demonstrating that every maximal ideal of $C(X)$ is of the form $\left\{f \in C(X) : f(x) = 0\right\}$ for some $x\in X$. I understand the proof, but I am struggling to assign geometric intuition to $C(X)$. (Ideally I would prefer to visualize the associated topological spaces in the context of a familiar manifold like $S_n$.) What does $\operatorname{Spec}(C(X))$ look like? I'm not sure how to approach this question, but my conjecture is that it's not that much different from $\operatorname{Max}(C(X))$. This is my reasoning: A prime ideal of $C(X)$ should probably be identified by its zeros on $X$. I'm not sure how to prove this exactly, but it seems to me that requiring zeros is the only way to ensure that the a subset of $C(X)$ is closed as a $C(X)$-module. If you cut out an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subsetneq C(X)$ by $\left\{f\in C(X) : f(x) = 0 \ \forall x\in Z\right\}$, $Z \subseteq X$; $\mathfrak{a}$ cannot possibly be prime if $Z$ is finite. (The product of two functions with one zero can have two zeros.) As above, if $Z$ is infinite, it seems that $\mathfrak{a}$ is in fact prime. So I suspect that $\operatorname{Spec}(C(X))$ is, as a poset, isomorphic to $\left\{A \in \mathscr{P}(X) : A \ \text{infinite}\right\}$. Am I on the right track?

Suppose we label its four edges in cyclic order as $E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4$ so that $E_1$ is parallel to $E_3$ and $E_2$ is parallel to $E_4$. Now, choose some partition $\{A,B\}$ of $S$. Must at least one of the following alternatives hold? There is a quasicomponent of $A$ intersecting both $E_1$ and $E_3$. There is a quasicomponent of $B$ intersecting both $E_2$ and $E_4$. This statement is analogous to the (discrete) statement that a game of hex always has a winner. It seems that the continuous statement I'm asking about is intuitively correct (especially if we were to add a requirement that $A$ is closed or otherwise well-behaved), but it seems unclear how to handle the generality of this statement. Moreover, things do seem to break down: this question shows that both conditions could hold, as well as that neither could hold if we replace ""quasiconnected"" by ""path connected"". The comments give a counterexample for ""connected"" as well. I'd primarily like to apply this in the case where $A$ and $B$ are reasonably well behaved (something comparable with $A$ being closed), but I wasn't able to quickly cook up any counterexamples even if we try to bring the axiom of choice into this, so I've been thinking that maybe such assumptions are unnecessary.","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

\end{equation} If ${V_1} \subset {V_2}$ also $\mu ({V_1}) \le \mu ({V_2})$ And now the tricky part, my question is, why is the following a consistent definition? and why for every $E$? It seems reasonable since X is locally compact Hausdorff according to the assumptions in the theorem, but I am unable to come up with a rigorous proof. The consistent definition:
$$\mu (E) = inf\{ \mu (V):E \subset V,V\,open\} $$
if $E$ is an open set, and $\mu(E)$ is consistent to the before mentioned definition for every $E\subset{X}$. Note:
$$f \prec V$$
Is notation for that $V$ is open, $f \in {C_c}(X)$, i.e. $f$ is continuous with compact support, $ 0 \le f \le 1 $ and the support lies in $V$. Also $\Lambda$ is a positive linear functional. Thank you very much in advance!","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

What I have done so far: My idea was to first prove that $\mathcal O_K = \mathbb Z[\alpha ]$ (with $K := \mathbb Q[\alpha]$) and after that show that the class number $h_K = 1$. This would imply the claim.
So I calculated the discriminant: $$d\left(\mathbb Z[\alpha ]\right) = D(f) = -15536 = (-1)\cdot 2^4 \cdot 971$$
From this I can derive $\mathcal O_K = \mathbb Z[\alpha ]$ (Since $f$ is an Eisenstein-polynomial for $p=2$ we know that $2 \nmid \left[ \mathcal O_K : \mathbb Z [\alpha] \right]$, but $[ \mathcal O_K : \mathbb Z [\alpha] ]^2 \cdot d(\mathcal O_K)= d(\mathbb Z[\alpha ]) = (-1)\cdot 2^4 \cdot 971$. Therefore $[ \mathcal O_K : \mathbb Z [\alpha] ]= 1$ and $\mathcal O_K = \mathbb Z[\alpha ]$) However I am having problems showing $h_K = 1$. I have calculated the Minkowski bound $M$. It is $M<7$. So I only need to look at the prime ideals above $2,3$ and $5$ and show that they are principal already (right?).

2824317,Finite fields containing cube root of unity and square root of $-3$,"Let $q=p^n$. For what $q$ does $\mathbb F_q$ contain a primitive cube root of unity? Deduce for which $q$ the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ splits into linear factors in $\mathbb F_q[x]$. Use the quadratic formula when appropriate to find these factors. Over which fields is it inappropriate to use the quadratic formula? Which finite fields contain a square root of $-3$ and which do not? If $x$ is a primitive cube root of unity in $\mathbb F_q$, then $x\ne 1, x^2\ne 1$ but $x^3=1$ in $\mathbb F_q$. Equivalently, $x^3-1=0$ or $(x-1)(x^2+x+1)=0$. Since $x$ is primitive and $\mathbb F_q$ has no zero divisors, $x^2+x+1=0$. Now I believe the fields containing a primitive cube root of 1 are the fields over which this polynomial splits. So are the first two parts asking the same question? Anyway, I don't know how to describe the fields having either property. For the quadratic formula part, $x=\frac{-1\pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}$; this is valid provided $2\ne 0$ i.e. provided the characteristic isn't 2. So the polynomial splits iff $\sqrt{-3}$ lies in the field (provided the characteristic isn't 2). So is the third part asking the same as the first two? Let $F=\mathbb F_q$. $F$ contains a primitive cube root of unity $\iff$ $x^2+x+1$ has a root over $F$  that isn't equal to $1$ $\iff$$x^3-1$ has a root over $F$  that isn't equal to $1$ $\iff$ $F^\ast $ contains an element of order $3$ $\iff$ $3$ divides $p^n-1$ $\iff$  the conditions on $p,n$ from the answer of @lhf are met. So those conditions is the answer to 1. To get an answer for 2, we need to add to those $p$ and $n$ the values of $p,n$ for which $x^2+x+1$ has a root that is equal to $1$. Such values are $p=3, n$ is arbitrary. So the answer to 2 is the values from lhf's answer as well as $p=3, n$ arbitrary.","['finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'field-theory']"
