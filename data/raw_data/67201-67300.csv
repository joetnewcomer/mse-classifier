801975,local parameter on an irreducible affine algebraic curve,"On page 14 of Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry 1 , it is stated that for an irreducible affine algebraic curve $X: f(x,y) = 0$, and a nonsingular point $P \in X$, there is a regular function $t$ (called the local parameter) that vanishes at $P$, and such that for every rational function $u$ that is not identically $0$ on $X$, $u = t^k v$ for some $k$ and some regular function $v$ where $v(P) \neq 0$. Now, it is proved in the case where $P = (0,0)$ and where $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \neq 0$, and in this case we get $t = x$. He calls $k$ the multiplicity of the zero of $P$ on $u$. My questions are: (1) How would our function $t$ change if we didn't have $P = (0,0)$ or $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \neq 0$? (2) What is the significance of the number $k$? In particular, is it related at all to the multiplicity of a point on $X$ ($m_P(X)$ as in Fulton's Algebraic Curves )? (3) In the absence of any commutative algebra machinery (e.g. local rings), how can I make sense of any of this?! For the answers, it would be nice if the use of things like local rings, etc..., could be kept to a minimum. I am more or less familiar with just pages 1-14 of Shafarevich. EDIT: I realize this is asking for a lot, so any partial answers will get votes, and in time, I'll select the best one.","['affine-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
801984,Is it possible to find the limit of a sequence using the definition of a limit?,"Suppose we have a sequence $x_n = (\frac{1}{n})$ and we want to find $$\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \ ?$$ by the definition of limit. Clearly, the limit is $0$ but if we were not able to determine this by intuition (as is the case with more complex sequences), is there a way to find that the limit of this sequence is $0$ by using the definition of a limit? Or is the only option to make an educated guess and attempt to prove it using the definition?",['limits']
801986,Prove that a sequence defined by a recurrence relation converges,"Consider the following recurrence relation: $$
  a_i = \frac{i+2}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{i}{i+1} - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{2 a_j}{2i - j + 2}\right).
$$ The first ten terms are: $0.75$ $0.733333333333$ $0.728174603175$ $0.725850340136$ $0.72458353375$ $0.723808024231$ $0.723294499472$ $0.722934619774$ $0.722671361045$ $0.722472200516$. It is natural to conjecture that the sequence converges. How can one prove it? Actually, for my application it would be enough to prove convergence in the sense of Cesàro. Some partial results. It is easy to see that if $a_i$ converges, then the limit is equal to $1 / \ln 4 \approx 0.722$. If we assume that for a very large $i$ we have $a_j = 1 / \ln 4$ for all $j < i$, then we get
$$
  a_i = \frac{7}{8 \ln 2} - \frac{1}{2} + o(1),
$$
which is strictly larger than $1 / \ln 4$.
Thus, we must use the fact that $a_i$ does not converge too fast. One can check empirically, that $a_i - 1 / \ln 4$ behaves roughly like $i^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is around $1.6$. Probably, with some effort one can even find the exact value of $\alpha$, but it would be great to do things more systematically.","['dynamical-systems', 'matrices', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"

802111,$L^1$ function unbounded on every interval,"[My question concerns part of Exercise 2.25 in Folland's Real Analysis text.] I'm looking at the function $g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n}f(x-r_n)$, where $f(x)=x^{-1/2}$ for $x\in (0,1)$ and $f(x)=0$ elsewhere, and $\{r_n\}$ is some enumeration of the rational numbers.  I am trying to prove that $g$ is discontinuous at every point.  It is easy enough to see that $g$ is discontinuous wherever it is finite (since it is unbounded on every interval), and that it is finite almost everywhere (since it is in particular in $L^1$).  However, it seems to me that to show that $g$ is discontinuous at a point $x_0$ with $g(x_0)=+\infty$, one would have to exhibit a sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x_0$ such that $\{g(x_n)\}$ is bounded.  It seems intuitively obvious to me that such a sequence exists, but I have not been able to construct one.  Any suggestions? (Hints preferred to answers.)",['real-analysis']
802117,Covering a closed disk in a rigid analytic space by residue classes,"Recently I have been reading through the PhD thesis of Dr. Louis Brewis, ""Ramiﬁcation theory of the p-adic open disc and the lifting problem"", which is available free here: http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/dissts/Ulm/Brewis2009.pdf?origin=publication_detail The set-up for my question is based on the third chapter at the bottom of the 58th page. Namely, we have a complete DVR R with maximal ideal $(\pi)$, field of fractions K, and algebraically closed residue field k of prime characteristic p. We let $Y = (Spf R[[z]]) \otimes K$ be an open rigid disk over K, with $G$ a finite p-group of automorphisms of $Y$ that has a nonempty number of fixed points. We denote the set of fixed points by $\Delta$. We let $D \subset Y$ be the smallest closed disk that contains $\Delta$. The part I don't understand is that Brewis writes we can find a finite family $(E_j)_{j \in J}$ of residue classes $E_j \subset D$ such that $E_j \cap \Delta \neq \emptyset$ and that $\cup_j E_j = D$. How do we know that this can be done? In the context of this paper, we are inducting on the cardinality of $\Delta$, and so this finite cover by residue classes cannot just be one set equal to $D$. I assumed residue class refers to the residue class of an element, i.e. the set of points that have the same image in the special fiber as a given point. Via translation, we should be able to assume WLoG that $D = \{z : v(z) \geq n\}$ where $v$ is the order of $z$ with respect to the uniformizer $\pi$, and where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is fixed. In such a case, I don't see how we can get a finite cover by residue classes. As n is positive ($Y$ is open) and $E_j$ is assumed to be in $D$, it would seem to me that we may only consider the residue class of an element in the ideal $(\pi)$, at which point we will have all of $D$ (and possibly more) in the residue class. Might the residue class refer instead to open sets about a point of the form $\{z : |z-a| < p^{-n}\}$? In that case, because the residue field is infinite, I am still unsure how to get a finite cover by residue classes. Thank you for reading, Garnet",['algebraic-geometry']
802126,$\mu(X)<\infty$. $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure iff $\int_X \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|}d\mu \rightarrow 0$.,"Let $f,f_n\in \mathcal{M}$ and $\mu(X)<\infty$. Then $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure if and only if $\int_X \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|}d\mu \rightarrow 0$. To prove from left what I did is if the integral converges to 0 then either measure of $X$ is small or the term in it. First case gives the result directly. For second $|f_n-f|$ must converge to 0. Which means almost everywhere convergence and in finite measure space it implies convergence in measure by Egoroff's Theorem. Is this true?

Does that make sense? Because $\partial\mathcal M$ is just two isolated points. We are integrating a function to a single point? The only thing that makes some sense would be the value of the function at those points, and only because it coincides in a specific problem with what I should get by integrating $d\omega$ to the curve, but I don't see that clear at all.

My solution: Since $\sigma_n$ converges, it is a Cauchy sequence. So, $\forall\epsilon,\forall\delta>0, \exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ s.t.$\forall n, \forall m> N , |n a_n-0|<\epsilon$ and

    b = \frac{2q}{\sin C} = \frac{qc}{R}$$ Multiply and simplify. My understanding :- $R$ is the circumradius of triangle $ABC$. By Law Of Sines, $a/\sin A = b/\sin B = c/\sin C = 2R$. The side $AB$ is common to the 2 triangles having radii p and R, just
as $AC$ is common to other 2 triangles having radii q and R. By the Law Of Sines, $2p = c/\sin C'$ ,if we call C' as the side
which is the 3rd side of triangle whose radius is p and shares AB
with ABC. Similarly $2q = a/\sin A'$ if we call A' as the side which is not
shared by the triangle whose radius is q. Have I understood correctly so far ? If then, how is $c=2p\sin B$?",['geometry']

Any idea what the various reasons might be? It's self-evident enough to me. Edit Sorry, my bad, right after the sentence, (the above quote), there is a footnote, says that: The chief reason for this alleged lack of self-evidence seems to have been the fact that the parallel axiom makes an assertion about infinitely remote regions of space. Euclid defines parallel lines as straight lines in a plane that, ""being produced indefinitely in both directions,"" do not meet. Accordingly, to say that two lines are parallel is to make the claim that the two lines will not meet even ""at infinity."" But the ancients were familiar with lines that, though they do not intersect each other in any finite region of the plane, do meet ""at infinity."" Such lines are said to be ""asymptotic."" Thus, a hyperbola is asymptotic to its axes. It was therefore not intuitively evident to the ancient geometers that from a point outside a given straight line only one straight line can be drawn that will not meet the given line even at infinity.","['geometry', 'math-history']"

$\cos(x) -1 + \frac{x^2}{2} =  0 \\ $

Since $\left(\cos(x) -1 + \frac{x^2}{2}\right)' =  -\sin(x) + x \\ $
and $-\sin(0) + 0 = 0 \\$
The function has no local minima and maxima. Since the derivative of the function is positive, the function is strictly increasing so the lowest value is f(0) .

z > 0 \implies \frac{1}{z} \to +\infty \\
z < 0 \implies \frac{1}{z} \to -\infty \\
\frac{e^h - 1}{h} = \frac{z}{\ln(1+z)} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{z}\ln(1+z)} = \bigg[ y = \frac{1}{z} \bigg] =  \frac{1}{y\ln(1+\frac{1}{y})} = \frac{1}{\ln(1+\frac{1}{y})^y} \\
h \to 0 \implies |y| \to +\infty \implies \bigg(1+\frac{1}{y}\bigg)^y \to e \implies \\
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{e^h - 1}{h} = \frac{1}{\ln e} = 1
\implies (e^x)' = e^x \cdot 1 = e^x$$ But how do I prove that $\lim_{\pm\infty}(1 + \frac{1}{x})^x = e$ ? We defined $e$ like this:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^n = e \space \,, \space n\in\mathbb{N}$$ I thought of the sandwich theorem: $\forall x \geq 1 \,, x\in\mathbb{R} \,, \lfloor x \rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1$ and $\lfloor x \rfloor , \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 \in \mathbb{N} $ and if I denote $\mathbb{N} \ni n = \lfloor x \rfloor$ I have:
$$ \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)^n \leq  \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{x}\bigg)^x \leq \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n+1} \\ 
 \lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)^n = \frac{\lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)^{n+1}}{\lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)} = \frac{e}{1+0} = e \\
 \lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n+1} =  \lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^n \cdot \lim_{n\to+\infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg) = e \cdot (1 + 0) = e$$ and now I could apply the theorem but then again, how do I show that this: $\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)^n \leq  \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{x}\bigg)^x \leq \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n+1}$ is true? I mean, I can say that (left side):
$$ n+1 > x \implies \frac{1}{n+1} < \frac{1}{x} \implies 1 + \frac{1}{n+1} < 1 + \frac{1}{x} \\
\forall y\in\mathbb{R_+} \space n \leq x \implies y^n \leq y^x \\
\implies \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\bigg)^n \leq  \bigg(1 + \frac{1}{x}\bigg)^x$$
and by analogy the right side but is this a proof in terms of limits? and that's just $+\infty$ for $x \geq 1$, what do I do for $-\infty$ ? For $x\in\langle 0, 1\rangle$, a substitution $y = \frac{1}{x}$ gives me:
$$\lim_{y\to 0}\bigg(1 + y\bigg)^\frac{1}{y}$$ I'll stop here to see if I'm on the right track, any hints, suggestions, edits, comments and answers are welcome!","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
803161,Solving a system of integral-partial differential equations,"Hi I am a student in electrical engineering. Currently I am facing a difficult problem solving a coupled integral-differential partial equations arising from mean field game. The problem is similar as in http://mfglabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cfe.pdf The Bellman cost function is defined as $u(t,R) = \max_{p(s)\geq0,s\geq t} E\left[\int_t^{\infty}-\left[p(s)g_1 - g_2(I(s)+N_0)\right]^2e^{-r(s-t)}ds\right]$ where $g_1,g_2,N_0 > 0$ are constant and $R \geq 0$ $dR = -pdt + \lambda dW$ where $W$ is a Wiener process $I(t) =\frac{d}{dt}\int Rm(t,R)dR $ where $m(t,R)$ is the probability distribution of $R$ at time $t$ For mean field game, I assume $I(t)$ and $p(t)$ are independent. I applied the HJB equation and the Fokker Planck equation to get a system of partial equations as : $\partial_tu(t,R) +\lambda^2\partial^2_{RR}u(t,R) -ru(t,R)+ \max_{p\geq 0}\{-(pg_1 - g_2(I+N_0))^2-p\partial_{R} u(t,R)\}= 0 $ $\partial_t m(t,R) - \partial_R [p(t,R)m(t,R)] = \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \partial^2_{RR}[m(t,R)] $ $\int m(t,R)dR = 1 $ $I$ is calculated as above. The initial condition is known as $m(0,R) = f(R)$ where $f$ are known distribution Solving the Hamiltonian I can get the optimal control $p$. However when I replace $p$ back into the HJB this becomes a system of integral-partial differential equations that I can not solve. The paper suggests using eductive method to find the answer however using Google search returns no result. I want to ask if someone know any directions or (Matlab) methods to approximately solve these equations in order to find $m$ and $u$ ?

803175,Automorphisms of a field extension permute roots of irreducible factors.,Would someone mind confirming (or refuting) the following... Proposition. Let $K$ be a field and let $f \in K[X]$. Suppose $g \in K[X]$ is an irreducible factor of $f$. Let $L$ be a splitting field for $f$ over $K$. Then Aut$(L/K)$ permutes the roots of $g$. Proof. Let $x \in L$ be a root of $g$ and let $\sigma \in$ Aut$(L/K)$. As $g \in K[X]$ we have $\sigma g = g$. Clearly $\sigma(x)$ is a root of $\sigma g$ and so the result follows. // Many thanks :),"['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
803193,The relationship between CPTP maps and quadratic forms,"Let $H$ be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space (so there is a canonical isomorphism $H\cong H^*$). For a Hilbert space $H$ define $B(H)$ to be the space of linear operators on $H$; we have $B(H)\cong H\otimes H^*$. Suppose $\Lambda:B(H)\to B(H)$ is a CPTP (completely positive trace preserving) map. In particular it is linear, so we can view it as an element of $B(H)\otimes B(H)^*\cong (H\otimes H^*)\otimes (H\otimes H^*)^*$. There is an isomorphism $F$ from this space to $[(H\otimes H^*)\otimes (H\otimes H^*)]^*$, the space of bilinear (or quadratic) forms on $H\otimes H^*$. The map is defined by $F(|E_{kl}\rangle\langle E_{ij}|)=\langle E_{ki}|\otimes \langle E_{lj}|$. (I think--if another map makes more sense then replace this.) Note here we are viewing matrices as vectors in the space $B(H)$. Question : What is the condition on $F(\Lambda)$ that is equivalent to $\Lambda$ being CPTP (and why might it intuitively hold), and is there a way to prove this directly? Is this a useful perspective? By the Kraus representation, the CPTP maps $\Lambda$ are exactly those in the form $\Lambda(\rho)=\sum_i A_i\rho A_i^{\dagger}$. The above then maps $\Lambda$ to the quadratic form $\sum_i\langle A_i|\otimes \langle A_i|$, which is positive semidefinite quadratic form. In particular, for example, this tells us that we need at most $n^2$ matrices $A_i$. So $F(\Lambda)$ being positive semidefinite is a necessary condition for $\Lambda$ to be CPTP; what is a necessary and sufficient condition? Furthermore, this was proved using Kraus representation, but could it be proved directly (and hence the Krause representation would be a corollary)?","['linear-algebra', 'hilbert-spaces']"

803221,"$\operatorname{ord}(u)=r,\,\operatorname{ord}(v)=s$ $\,\Rightarrow\,\operatorname{ord}(uv)=rs\,$ if $\,r,s\,$ (co)primes","Let u and v be elements of a commutative group, and suppose that their
  orders are r and s, respectively. Show that if r and s are distinct
  primes then the order of uv is rs. I will use the follwing theorem to proof this. Theorem : Let x be an element of order m in a finite group G. Then $$x^s=1$$ in G if and only if s i a multiple of m. My attempt We can here see that
$$(uv)^{rs}=[commutative]=u^{rs}v^{rs}=1^s1^r=1$$
By the theorem, this tells us that this is true only if only rs is a multiple of the order of $uv$. Let the order be $ord(uv)=k$. We know that every positive integer can be written as
$$a=bm+l, 0<=l<b$$
and since $r$ and $s$ is primes (positive integers), $rs$ can be written as
$$rs=km+l, 0<=l<k$$
This gives ut that
$$1=(uv)^{rs}=(uv)^{km+l}=1^muv^l=(uv)^l$$
If l>0 then the equation $(uv)^l=1$ contradicts that the positive integer k is the least positive integer for which $(uv)^k=1$. Therefore l=0 and $rs=km$ . We can here see that $rs$ is a multiple of k ( and this proof also the theorem) . 
$$rs=km => k | rs => k|r     ORk|s$$
But we know that $r$ and $s$ are distinct primes, so k must be equal to one of the primes . $$k=r => (uv)^k=(uv)^r=1v^r=v^r=1$$
And since we know that $ord(v)=s$ the theorem tells us that $r$ must be a multiple of $s$. But since both of them is primes, we get that $r=s$ but this is a contradiction (r and s are distincts as the exercise tells us). Now, we try with $k=s$. Same as above, we get that $s=r$ which is a contradiction. Neither k=r nor k=s is right since by the theorem we get that $k=r=s$ and we have that $r$ and $s$ are distincts. This tells us that k cannot be equal to r nor s, since this gives us that $r=s$. And since we know (and as i did proof)that  $$rs=km$$, this tells us, as i wrote before, that
$$k|rs$$
Since k is neither equal to $r$ or $s$, this tells us that k must be equal to $rs$. Therefore $$ord(uv)=k=rs$$. Edit: i know that this can be prooved by l.c.m(x,y) but we have not used it so far.

803290,"If $\int_0^\infty x f(x) \ dx < \infty$, is $\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty f(x+y) \ dx \ dy< \infty$?","Question: Let $f : [0, \infty) \to [0,\infty)$ be a measurable function which, more than being integrable, satisfies $\int_0^\infty x f(x) < \infty$. Does it follow that  $\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty  f(x+y) \ dx \ dy< \infty$? Remark: The conclusion does not hold if you only assume $\int_0^\infty f(x) \ dx <\infty$. For example, the sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}$ is such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n < \infty$, but $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=1}^\infty a_{n+m} = \infty$.  It's not difficult to adapt this example to the present setting. Remark: Things also fall apart if the integral $\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty  f(x+y) \ dx \ dy$ isn't taken over the first quadrant only. If $f : \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)$ is measurable and not zero almost everywhere, then assuming $\int_0^\infty x f(x) \ dx < \infty$ doesn't change the fact that the integral of $f(x+y)$ over every, e.g., horizontal line will be the same positive number so that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x+y) \ dx \ dy = \infty$. Added: In retrospect, a nice geometric way to see that the two integrals should be equal is to note that $(x,y) \mapsto f(x+y)$ is constant along lines of slope $-1$, the value of $f$ on $x+y = a$  being $f(a)$.  Meanwhile, the length of the intersection of $x+y = a$ with the 1st quadrant grows linearly with $a$.","['integration', 'real-analysis']"

Now write the contour integral as
$$
0=\oint_C f(z)dz=P\int_{C_1}  + \ P\int_{C_2} +\  P\int_{C_3}+\ P\int_{C_4}+\ P\int_{C_5}+\ P\int_{C_6}.
$$
Explicitly we can now calculate three contour integrals over $C_1, C_2, C_3$ by using $z=xe^{2\pi i}$, $dz=dxe^{i2\pi}=dx$ and we obtain
\begin{equation}
P\int_{C_1}+\ P\int_{C_2}+\ P\int_{C_3}=\lim_{R\to\infty} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\int_{Re^{i(2\pi-\epsilon)}}^{(1+\epsilon)2\pi i} \frac{z^{\lambda-1}}{1-z}dz-\frac{1}{2}2\pi i\cdot Res_{z=e^{2\pi i} }[f(z)]	+e^{2\pi i(\lambda-1)}	\int_{1}^{0} \frac{x^{\lambda-1}}{1-x}dx.
\end{equation}
Note the first integral in terms of $z$ can just be written as
$$
\lim_{R\to\infty} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\int_{Re^{i(2\pi-\epsilon)}}^{(1+\epsilon)2\pi i} \frac{z^{\lambda-1}}{1-z}dz=\int_{\infty}^{1} \frac{x^{\lambda-1}}{1-x}dx

803449,$\mathbb{Z} _{29}$ is a field. True or False.,"My answer was True and this is my argument: Since $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ has got $2$ operations plus the other properties of a ring, I figured that it is indeed a ring. On the other hand, since $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is abelian (commutative) and has the multiplicative identity $1$, It can be concluded that it is a $Commutative$ Ring with an $identity$, hence implies that it is a Field. I've also read a theorem which states that: ""Every finite integral domain is a field."" Is my argument acceptable and can I also use the above theorem as an argument?

803659,Logic behind cubic resolution of $x^4+px^2+qx+r=0$,"I'm reading ""A course in algebra"" by E. B. Vinberg to have a basic understanding of algebra. In its Chapter 3 there's an interesting demonstration on cubic resolution of equation $x^4+px^2+qx+r=0$. Define $\sigma_i$ the elementary symmetric polynomials:
$$\sigma_i=\sum_{k_1<k_2<\cdots<k_i}x_{k_1}x_{k_2}\cdots x_{k_i}$$ Define $h_i(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$: $$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     h_1=x_1x_2+x_3x_4 \\ 
     h_2=x_1x_3+x_2x_4\\
     h_3=x_1x_4+x_2x_3
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ Then one has: $$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
       h_1+h_2+h_3&=\sigma_2 \\
       h_1h_2+h_1h_3+h_2h_3&=\sigma_1\sigma_3-4\sigma_4\\
       h_1h_2h_3&=\sigma_1^2\sigma_4+\sigma_3^2-4\sigma_2\sigma_4
     \end{array}
   \right. $$ Let $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$, $c_4$ be the roots of equation $x^4+px^2+qx+r=0$. Then 
$$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     \sigma_1(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)=0\\ 
     \sigma_2(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)=p\\
     \sigma_3(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)=-q\\
     \sigma_4(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)=r
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ Let $d_i=h_i(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)$. So $d_i$ are the roots of equation $y^3+a_1y^2+a_2y+a_3=0$ where 
$$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     a_1=-(d_1+d_2+d_3)\\ 
     a_2=d_1d_2+d_1d_3+d_2d_3\\
     a_3=-d_1d_2d_3
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ From step 2 one has $a_1=-p$, $a_2=-4r$, $a_3=4pr-q^2$. So the equations has the form $y^3-py^2-4ry+(4pr-q^2)=0$. This is assumed solvable. Define
$$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     b_1=c_1+c_2-c_3-c_4\\ 
     b_2=c_1-c_2+c_3-c_4\\ 
     b_3=c_1-c_2-c_3+c_4
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ So one has
$$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     b_1^2=4(d_1-p)\\ 
     b_2^2=4(d_2-p)\\ 
     b_3^2=4(d_3-p)\\ 
     b_1b_2b_3=-8q
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ From here it leads to
$$ \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll} 
     c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4&=0\\ 
     c_1+c_2-c_3-c_4&=b_1&=2\sqrt{d_1-p_1}\\ 
     c_1-c_2+c_3-c_4&=b_2&=2\sqrt{d_2-p_1}\\ 
     c_1-c_2-c_3+c_4&=b_3&=2\sqrt{d_3-p_1}
     \end{array}
     \right.$$ So it's solved:
$$c_{1,2,3,4}=\frac{1}{2}(\pm\sqrt{d_1-p_1}\pm\sqrt{d_2-p_1}\pm\sqrt{d_3-p_1})$$
, with number of minuses being even, and the value of the square roots chosen so that $b_1b_2b_3=-8q$. Now, all these steps I understand, and they are quite smart. However, if we look at step 5, is it just some math trick (being sensitive to math forms) or there's something, some higher logic behind  it? The logic before step 5, to put it simple, is to get $d_i$ via $\sigma_i$, using the symmetry, without knowing exactly $c_i$. This is quite smart. So step 5 the idea is to get $c_i$ from $d_i$. How ppl get the formula in step 5 to achieve that? is it just by try and error, by luck? Or, there's some logic behind it? I suspect so as $b_i$ look similar to $d_i$, there seems also some ""indirect symmetry"" behind the construction of $b_i$. Please throw some lights?","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
