My Question : Obviously one can list all the elements in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$ and compute the center using brute force; but is there an easy way? I tried to make use of The Class Equation : $$|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_{i=1}^r|G: C_G(g_i)|$$ ( $g_i$ 's are the representatives of the distinct conjugacy classes of $G$ not contained in $Z(G)$ ), to no avail.

4574049,"In this checkerboard problem, is there a way to tell if any two situations are equivalent?","There is an infinite square grid chessboard with chess pieces placed on certain squares. There is at most one piece in a grid. We can perform the following operations each time: Split: Select a chess piece $(x,y)$ , if $(x+p,y)(x,y+q)(x+p,y+q)$ are empty, then delete it and put one chess piece in each of the three places. $p,q$ are valued between $\{-1,1\}$ ; Merge: Select a empty grid $(x,y)$ , if $(x+p,y)(x,y+q)(x+p,y+q)$ each has a chess piece, then delete the three chess pieces and add a chess piece to $(x,y)$ . $p,q$ are valued between $\{-1,1\}$ (just the inverse process of Split); In each operation we can decide p and q as we want. Given two situations, they are called equivalent if they can be converted to each other through a number of operations. For example, the following operations shows that the board with
pieces $(0,0),(0,1),(1,2)$ is equivalent to the board with pieces $(0,0),(-1,1),(0,2),(-1,-1),(1,-1)$ . A white piece means that it will be splited in the next step, while orange means that they will be merged in the next step. Is there an algorithm that can determine the equivalence of any two situations? Furthermore, is there an algorithm that can determine the equivalence of any two cases in polynomial time complexity?","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"

4574262,Counter-example: approximate an integrable function from below by a continuous function with compact support,"I'm reading this thread in which the OP asked if the following statement is true, i.e., Let $f$ be a non-negative measurable function and suppose that $f\in L^p(\Bbb R^n)$ , then for any $\delta \gt 0$ there exists a non-negative continuous function with compact support, note as $h_\delta$ , such that (1) $\int |f(x)|^p dx - \delta^p \le \int|h_\delta(x)|^pdx$ and (2) $h_\delta(x)\le f(x)$ for a.e. $x\in \Bbb R^n$ .

I'm trying to formalize @geetha290krm's idea as follows. Let $\lambda$ be the Lebesgue measure on $E := [0, 1]$ . We work with $L_1 (E, \lambda, \mathbb R_{\ge 0})$ . Let $C$ be the fat Cantor set. Then $\lambda(C)>0$ . Let $f := 1_C$ . Then $f=0$ on $E \setminus C$ . Because $h_\delta (x) \le f (x)$ for $\lambda$ -a.e. $x \in E$ , there is a $\lambda$ -null subset $N$ of $E$ such that $h_\delta \le f$ on $E \setminus N$ . It follows that $h_\delta = 0$ on $E \setminus  (C\cup N)$ and thus on $E \setminus  (\overline C \cup N)$ . Because $h_\delta$ is continuous, we get $h_\delta=0$ on $\overline{E \setminus (\overline C \cup N)}$ . Because $C$ is nowhere dense, we get $$
\overline{E \setminus \overline C} = E
\quad \text{and thus} \quad
\lambda \left ( \overline{E \setminus \overline C}  \right ) = 1.
$$ To show that $h_\delta=0$ $\lambda$ -a.e., it suffices to show that $$
\lambda \left ( \overline{E \setminus  (\overline C \cup N)} \right ) = 1.

Solution: The homogeneous equation $t^2 y^{\prime \prime}-2 t y^{\prime}+2 y=0$ is an Euler equation. The indicial equation is $\lambda(\lambda-1)-2 \lambda+2=0$ , with roots $\lambda=1, \lambda=2$ . The general solution of the homogeneous equation is thus $$

y(t)=\bar{y}(t)+C t+D t^2

4574267,Bounds on Jacobian in terms of Volume Distortion,"Let $V\subset U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ and let $\varphi:U\to V$ be a diffeomorphism. Let $J_{\varphi}$ be its Jacobian, so $vol(V) = \int_U |\det J_{\varphi}|$ . I am wondering if there are any general purpose lower bounds on $|\det J_{\varphi}(u)|$ over all $u\in U$ . For example, if $\varphi$ is measure/volume-preserving, $|\det J_{\varphi}| = 1$ . My intuition is that something like $$|\det J_{\varphi}|\ge \inf_{S\subset U}\frac{vol(S)}{vol(\varphi(S))}$$ should hold (with the convention that $\tfrac{0}{0} = 1$ ), but I'm unable to find any resources (and have not been able to furnish a proof nor counterexample -- my multivariable calculus is very rusty). Also, for my particular purpose I know that $vol(\varphi(S))\le vol(S)$ for all $S\subset U$ . Any help/hints are appreciated! EDIT: My intuition also says that an inequality of the other direction should hold as well: $$|\det J_{\varphi^{-1}}|\le \sup_{T\subset V}\frac{vol(\varphi^{-1}(T))}{vol(T)}.$$ Also, in my particular setup, $U = [0,1]^k$ . An idea I have for this is to bound the Jacobian by that of a linear map that $\phi([0,s]^k) = [0,1]^k$ that scales points up by a factor $1/s$ (for $0 < s < 1$ ). We'd choose $s$ to be minimal such that $[0,s]^k\supset V$ or something.

4574289,How many ways distinguishable objects can be distributed amongst distinguishable groups with restrictions.,"I am asked to find the total number of ways I can distribute  12 distinguishable objects  amongst 3 distinguishable groups (𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3) such that 𝑥1 receives at least 2 objects and 𝑥2,𝑥3 receive at least one each.

This seems to mean that the consequent of the theorem above is false. Hence the antecedent is false. And that means that the limit $$\lim\limits_{x\to a} g(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ does not exist, and therefore, $f$ is not differentiable at $a$ .

of the projection $p_1 : M × M → M$ to $R$ is a submersion. Where $$ R= \{(x,y)\in M\times M; x∼y\}$$ I have shown that 1 implies 2.

For example: the first term in the formula for $k=1$ is $n2^{n-1}a_{n-1}$ , and I don't understand why is this itself not equal to $a_n$ , because intuitively give $a_{n-1}$ ,you add one node and assume it to be highest in the order in comparison to all other nodes and now you have $n$ ways of doing this due to labelling and $2^{n-1}$ of connecting the $n-1$ nodes.

4574605,Why does $g_x$ depends continuously on $x$?,"In Vector Bundles and K-Theory (version 2.2, p.8), Hatcher explains: Lemma 1.1. A continuous map $h:E_1\to E_2$ between vector bundles over the same base space $B$ is an isomorphism if it takes each fiber $p_1^{-1}(b)$ to the corresponding fiber $p_2^{-1}(b)$ by a linear isomorphism. Proof: The hypothesis implies that $h$ is one-to-one and onto. What must be checked is that $h^{-1}$ is continuous. This is a local question, so we may restrict to an open set $U\subset B$ over which $E_1$ and $E_2$ are trivial. Composing with local trivializations reduces to the case that $h$ is a continuous map $U\times\mathbb{R}^n\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ of the form $h(x,v)=(x,g_x(v))$ . Here $g_x$ is an element of the group $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ of invertible linear transformations of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and $g_x$ depends continuously on $x$ . This means that if $g_x$ is regarded as an $n\times n$ matrix, its $n^2$ entries depends continuously on $x$ . The inverse matrix $g_x^{-1}$ also depends continuously on $x$ since its entries can be expressed algebraically in terms of the entries of $g_x$ , namely $g_x^{-1}$ is $1/(\det g_x)$ times the classical adjoint matrix of $g_x$ . Therefore $h^{-1}(x,v)=(x,g_x^{-1}(v))$ is continuous. $\square$ The part that confuses me is in bold. Why does $g_x$ depends continuously on $x$ ?","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

4574632,Smallest overlapping circles containing unit circles in each section,"This is a question inspired by the number of arrangements of n circles in the affine plane which was discussed on Numberphile . One way of overlapping 3 circles looks like this: My informal question is: what are the sizes of the 3 smallest circles for this arrangement subject to the limitation that each section is large enough to enclose a unit circle? The answer perhaps looks like this: That is approximate (and possibly wrong!). In my drawing the 2 lower circles have radius 2, which is clearly the smallest they can be and still enclose 2 distinct unit circles. The upper circle has a radius of... a bit more than 2. I think that to be well-defined, we must specify that we're looking for the smallest total area . What are the radii of circles which form the arrangement of circles that cover the minimum total area, subject to the constraint that each of the 5 sections encloses a unit circle? If anyone can answer the question, that would of course be great. But I'd also appreciate any useful partial answers, since I'm really not sure how to attack the problem. Note: In the overlapping circles problem, circles cannot be tangent. I'm not worried about that detail in the question I'm posing here. If the smallest arrangement includes 2 circles that touch in a tangent point (as I suspect it does), then the answer should more accurately be thought of as the limit as the circles get arbitrarily close.","['circles', 'geometry', 'computational-geometry']"

4574716,Are there any concrete examples of Baire spaces $X$ in which neither player has a winning strategy in BM(X),"Let $X$ be a topological space. A Banach-Mazur game $BM(X)$ is played by
two players $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , who select nonempty open subsets of $X$ . The player $\beta$ starts a game by selecting a nonempty open subset $V_1$ of $X$ . In return, $\alpha$ -player
chooses a nonempty open subset $W_1$ of $V_1$ . In general, at the $n$ -th stage of the
game, $n \geq 1$ , the player $\beta$ chooses a nonempty open subset $V_n ⊂ W_{n−1}$ and $\alpha$ answers by a nonempty open subset $W_n$ of $V_n$ . Proceeding in this fashion, the
players generate a sequence $(V_n,W_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ which is called a play. The player $\alpha$ is said to be the winner of the play $(V_n,W_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ if $\bigcap_{n\geq 1}V_n =\bigcap_{n\geq 1}W_n\neq \emptyset$ otherwise the player $\beta$ wins this play. A partial play is a finite sequence of sets
consisting of the first few moves of a play. A strategy for player $\alpha$ is a rule
by means of which the player makes his/her choices. Here is a more formal
definition of the notion strategy. A strategy s for the player $\alpha$ is a sequence
of mappings $s = \{ s_n\}$ , which is inductively defined as follows:
The domain of $s_1$ is the set of all open subsets of $X$ and $s_1$ assigns to each
nonempty open set $V_1 \subset X$ , a nonempty open subset $W_1 = s_1(V_1)$ of $V_1$ .
In general, if a partial play $(V_1, \ldots ,W_{n−1})$ has already been specified, where $W_i = s_i(V_1, \ldots , V_i)$ , $1 \leq i \leq n − 1$ . Then the domain of $s_n$ would be the set $\{(V_1,W_1, . . . ,W_{n−1}, V ):V \subset W_{n−1}\}$ can be the next move of $\beta$ -player
and it assigns to each choice $V_n \subset W_{n−1}$ some nonempty open subset $W_n = s_n(V_1,W_1, \ldots ,W_{n−1}, V_n)$ of $V_n$ . An $s$ -play is a play in which $\alpha$ selects his/her moves according to the strategy $s$ . The strategy $s$ for the player $\alpha$ is said to be a winning strategy if every $s$ -play
is won by $\alpha$ . A space $X$ is called $\alpha$ -favorable if there exists a winning
strategy for $\alpha$ in $BM(X)$ . My question: Is there a topological space $X$ which is  neither $\alpha$ -favorable nor $\beta$ -favorable?",['general-topology']

According to the mentioned post and its second comment, for all non-abelian finite simple group $G$ , there is an irreducible complex character $\chi$ such that $\chi(1)^2$ does not divide $|G|$ . The proof uses the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG), but we are interested in a CFSG-free proof, so if you find one, please post an answer to the mentioned post. Anyway, here we are interested in the finite perfect groups: Question : Is there a finite perfect group $G$ such that for all irreducible complex character $χ$ then $\chi(1)^2$ divides |G|? Bonus question 1 : Is there such a group which is a direct product of non-abelian finite simple groups? Bonus question 2 : If so, what is the minimum number of components for such a direct product? Two? Above bonus questions can be seen as a game with the prime factorization of the order of the non-abelian finite simple groups and their character degrees. Let us call a finite group $G$ thin if for all prime $p$ then there is an irreducible complex character $\chi$ such that $\nu_p(\chi(1)) = \nu_p(|G|)$ , where $\nu_p$ is the p-adic valuation . The seven first non-abelian finite simple groups ( $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$ with $q=5,7,9,8,11,13,17$ ) are thin. We wonder whether every $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$ is thin. Anyway, for our purpose here, we must consider non-thin groups only. A finite group $G$ will be called $p$ - fat if for all irreducible complex character $\chi$ then $\nu_p(\chi(1)) < \nu_p(|G|)$ . Note that a finite group is non-thin if and only if it is $p$ -fat for some prime $p$ . The first non-thin non-abelian finite simple group is $A_7$ , which is $2$ -fat. Now the notion of $p$ -fat group is not enough for our need. A finite group $G$ will be called $p$ - superfat if for all irreducible complex character $\chi$ then $2\nu_p(\chi(1)) < \nu_p(|G|)$ . The group $A_7$ is $2$ -superfat. The next $p$ -superfat non-abelian finite simple group is $M_{22}$ , which is also $2$ -superfat.

This map is useful because if $k$ is algebraically closed and its characteristic is zero, the Killing form is non degenerate iff $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple. On the other hand, given a field extension of finite degree $K/k$ , one defines the trace map $K \rightarrow k$ which sends $x\in K$ to $tr(r_x)$ , where $r_x \in End_k(K)$ is the multiplication by $x$ . Now, $K/k$ is separable iff the bilinear symmetric form $K \times K \rightarrow k, (x,y) \mapsto tr(r_xr_y)$ is non degenerate.

The map $r : K \rightarrow End_k(K), x \mapsto r_x$ sends $K$ into $GL(n,k)$ , so one may consider the Zariski closure of the image $r(K)$ ; this will be an algebraic group with an associated Lie algebra.

I have been told by my mentor that if limit exists along all straight lines, it doesn't mean that limit exists. I got the same information from Wikipidea.org as well as Thomas Calculus. However, I doubt this. I think that I have got something (at least for double variable functions), which can be called as a proof. What I know about limits is that there is a function say $f$ and for calculating limiting value at a point, we evaluate the function for points present in the point's close neighborhood. If all these values are approaching some number, we say that the number being approached is the limiting value. For example let's say that $f(x, y)$ is a function and we want its limiting value at $(0, 0)$ . According to what I have mentioned above about limits, we need to plug in several points in origin's close neighborhood to get the limiting value. If my interpretation of limit is correct, this should give us the correct answer. Let's say I evaluate the limit by approaching origin via lines $y = mx$ . I have full control over m and I can manipulate it as I wish. So, by doing this substitution, we can get any $(x, y)$ given both $x$ and $y$ are in close neighborhood of origin by manipulating value of m (Except for x = 0 for which the limiting value can be calculated separately). So, this method is same as the first method mentioned in the paragraph. But since, from three sources I was getting the same information, I feel that I am wrong. I request to please correct me by telling my mistake. All the three sources refer the following example as a proof: Quoting from en.wikipidea.org A study of limits and continuity in multivariable calculus yields many counterintuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions. For example, there are scalar functions of two variables with points in their domain which give different limits when approached along different paths. E.g., the function. $$f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$$ approaches zero whenever the point $(0,0)$ is approached along lines through the origin $({\displaystyle y=kx})$ . However, when the origin is approached along a parabola ${\displaystyle y=\pm x^{2}}$ , the function value has a limit of ${\displaystyle \pm 1/2}a$ . Since taking different paths toward the same point yields different limit values, a general limit does not exist there. I believe that limit doesn't exists along all lines in this case. Lets say $x_{0}$ is a non-zero x-coordinate of a point in close neighborhood of origin. Let us evaluate limit along a line $y = mx\space where\space m = x_0$ . Doing the substitution in the above function, we get, $$\lim\limits_{x \to 0}\frac{mx^3}{x^4 + m^2x^2}$$ This can be rewritten as $$\lim\limits_{x \to 0}\frac{\frac{m}{x}}{1 + (\frac{m}{x})^2}$$ Out of the several values in close neighborhood of origin, one will $(x_0, y)$ . If we plug in this point in our above function with $m=x_0$ , for this point, $f$ becomes $\frac{1}{3}$ . If I plug in $x = \frac {x_0} {2}$ , I get $\frac{2}{5}$ . Therefore limit doesn't exists along all the lines. However, Wikipedia, Thomas Calculus, my mentor all say that limit exists along all lines. My questions : Why, if limit exists along all lines, limit needn't exist along every other path. What is wrong in my attempt trying to contradict the example given on wikipidea. Sorry for my poor english. Thank you so much.","['multivariable-calculus', 'limits', 'calculus']"
4574877,Let $f_n\to f$ pointwise for measurable functions $f_n$. Is $f$ measurable?,"The following is a standard result of real-valued measurable functions: Theorem: let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions $(X,\Sigma_X)\to(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}})$ , where $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra generated by the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ . Then $$f_n\to f \text{ (pointwise)} \implies f \text{ is measurable}.$$ More generally, given a measurable function $(X,\Sigma_X)\to(Y,\Sigma_Y)$ , if the codomain measure space is Borel we can already talk (because there is a topology on $Y$ ) about limits of sequences i.e. questions such as $$\text{Does $f_n(x)$ have any limits as $n\to\infty$?}$$ make sense. If the topology in question is Hausdorff, the limits -if they exist- must be unique, and we can talk about the function $$f:X\to Y:x\mapsto \lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x).$$ With all that in mind, I'm wondering if the following, more general result holds: Theorem (?): let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions $(X,\Sigma_X)\to(Y,\mathcal{B}_{Y})$ , where $\mathcal{B}_Y$ is the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra generated by some Hausdorff topology $\tau$ on $Y$ . Then $$f_n\to f \text{ (pointwise)} \implies f \text{ is measurable}.$$ I know two proofs of the theorem involving real-valued functions: one which uses $\liminf f$ and $\limsup f$ , and another which works with $\pi$ -systems and the fact that $f$ is measurable if and only if $$\{f\le c\} := \{r\in\mathbb{R} : f(r) \le c\}\in\Sigma_X \ \text{for any } c\in\mathbb{R}.$$ Neither proof seems generalizable. In this post the OP asks whether the above result is true for first countable Hausdorff spaces, and it seems they recieve no solid answer on the matter.

If the base of the triangle is drawn so that it is tangent to the central incircle, then the two neighboring circles at the bottom are cut exactly in half. I hope the image makes it more clear. Now, my question is: for any given base or height of the triangle, or for any given radius of the central incircle, what is the radius of the smaller circles?

 }\phi _{\ell m}(r)Y_{\ell m}(\theta ,\phi ),}$ we can express its gradient in terms of the VSH as ${\displaystyle \nabla \phi =\sum _{\ell =0}^{\infty }\sum _{m=-\ell

If $\phi$ is $H^1$ function, then we expect its derivative to also have an spherical harmonic expansion. However, how do we know rigourosuly that it can be obtained by term by term differentiation of the series for $\phi$ in the above manner? In other words, how do we know the coefficients for the spherical harmonic expansion of $\nabla\phi$ is related to the coefficients for the spherical harmonic expansion of $\phi$ via term by term differentiation?

F_2 = \int_1^\infty x^2 \left[ \int_{-1}^{+1} \frac{e^{-\alpha\sqrt{1+x^2-2xy}}(xy-1)}{(1+x^2-2xy)^{3/2}}dy\right]dx
$$ Prove or disprove that $F_1 = F_2$ . Source of the problem are the equations (3) and (4) in A Paradox of Newtonian Gravitation and Laplace’s Solution by Amitabha Ghosh and Ujjal Dey.
They have done already numerical experiments that seem to confirm equality. Quote: an analytical proof showing that F1 and F2 are exactly equal will be an interesting mathematical exercise. And that's it. I have no idea how to proceed. Progress so far I promised myself not to do numerical experiments.
But the outcome of the inner integral - the one between square brackets - is indeed terrible.
So what else would be an option?
With MAPLE 8 some values in the publication can be reproduced. for k from 0 to 10 do
alpha := k*0.1;
g(x,alpha) := int(exp(-alpha*sqrt(1+x^2+2*x*y))*(x*y+1)/(1+x^2+2*x*y)^(3/2),y=-1..1);
F1 := evalf(int(g(x,alpha)*x^2,x=0..1));
F2 := evalf(int(-g(x,alpha)*x^2,x=1..10^3)); 
end do; The special case $\alpha = 0$ gives $\,F_1=\frac{2}{3}\,$ and $\,F_2=0\,$ exactly.
So it appears that nearby $\alpha = 0$ the integrals must be unequal.
But MAPLE keeps calculating endlessly for those low values and I had to manually stop the program. Feynman trick . $F_1$ and $F_2$ are both a function of $\alpha$ . We can take derivatives under the integral sign and see what happens near $\alpha=0$ . $$
\left.\frac{dF_1}{d\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0} =
- \int_0^1 x^2 \left[ \int_{-1}^{+1} \frac{xy+1}{1+x^2+2xy}dy\right]dx = -\frac{1}{2} \\

- \int_1^\infty x^2 \left[ \int_{-1}^{+1} \frac{xy-1}{1+x^2-2xy}dy\right]dx = \infty \\
\Longrightarrow \quad dF_2 = \infty\,d\alpha
$$ Leading to the following heuristics. $F_1(\alpha)$ is somewhat decreasing from $F_1(0)=2/3$ to lower values, but the increase in $F_2(0)=0$ is infinitely large at that place.
Based upon this, it's impossible to keep up appearances )-:

4575173,Is a general state space a manifold?,"I asked a similar question on the physics SE at this link but did not really get an answer so I'll ask here. My question there is a bit more detailed. From what I have recently learned, in classical mechanics, the configuration of some mechanical systems (say, a double pendulum) can be described by a point on an n -dimensional smooth configuration manifold, $Q$ . The dynamics are then often studied using Lagrangian mechanics on $TQ$ , or using Hamiltonian mechanics on $T^*Q$ , both of which have coordinate representations in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . Long before I ever heard the word manifold, I was ""doing"" dynamics using some 2n ""state space"" variables in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . I know now that when using state space variables of the form $(\pmb{x},\dot{\pmb{x}})$ , I'm really working with some coordinate representation of $(\text{x},\mathbf{v})\in TQ$ . I could transform to some other coordinates $(\pmb{q},\dot{\pmb{q}})$ but, contrary to what I used to think,  this is not actually a different state space but rather just different coordinates for the same $(\text{x},\mathbf{v})\in TQ$ (right?). Similarly, when using state space variables of the form $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p}_{x})$ (phase space coordinates), I'm really working with some coordinate representation of $(\text{x},\mathbf{p})\in T^*Q$ . I could transform to some other $(\pmb{q},\pmb{p}_{q})$ but again this is not a different phase space but just different coordinates for the same $(\text{x},\mathbf{p})\in T^*Q$ (right?). My Question: When working directly with coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ , we also commonly use more general ""state space"" coordinates which are not necessarily of the lagrangian form, $(\pmb{x},\dot{\pmb{x}})$ , nor of the canonical/symplectic form $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p})$ , but are rather just some 2n variables that fully define the state (for example, the classic Keplerian orbit element for the two-body problem). Are such coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ actually a coordinate representation for some ``state space manifold '' ?  Or put differently, it seems $TQ$ and $T^*Q$ are two particular types of a ""state space manifold"" for which the coordinates and equations of motion have certain properties, but is there a more general manifold on which we can study the dynamics? note: I'm aware that in the Hamiltonian formulation we can use some canonical transformation such that the coordinates $(\pmb{x},\pmb{p})$ are not necessarily split into ""position level"" coordinates and ""velocity-level"" coordinates. The Delaunay variables for the two-body problem are an example of this. So this would be an example of ""jumbled"" coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ which are actually just still coordinates for the same $T^*Q$ .","['classical-mechanics', 'dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

I am trying to show that the unitary closed ball of $X$ ( $B_1(0)$ ) is, indeed, closed with a direct proof. Attempt. By definition, $$ B_1(0) = \{x \in X \colon \|x\| \leqslant 1\}. $$ We say $B_1(0)$ is closed if it contains all of its limits points, i.e., if $\overline{B_1(0)} \subset B_1(0)$ . Thus, let $x \in \overline{B_1(0)}$ be an arbitrary element. Then, there exists a convergent sequence $(x_k)_{k \in \Bbb N}$ such that $x_k$ converges to $x$ . By definition of convergent sequence, $$ \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N = N(\epsilon) \colon \forall n \in \Bbb N, n > N \Rightarrow \| x_n-x\| < \epsilon. $$ Now, we just see that $$ \|x\| = \|(x-x_n)+x_n \| = \|x_n - (x_n-x) \| \geqslant |\,\|x_n\| - \|x_n-x\|\,| \geqslant | \, \|x_n\| - \epsilon \, |$$ But I don't know how to proceed from here...

However it seems that $ PSL(2,2^k) $ is simple and Schur trivial for all $ k \geq 3 $ .

A rotation of one of the faces of the cube can therefore be described as an element of $S_{24}$ (giving every square a number and checking how they move when we do a rotation of one of the faces). In GAP we could define these rotations (that generate all possible manipulations) as gap> U := (1,2,3,4)(5,17,13,9)(6,18,14,10);

gap> D := (21,22,23,24)(11,15,19,7)(12,16,20,8); If we now define the pocket cube as the subgroup of $S_{24}$ that is generated by these elements we get a subgroup of size $88179840=2^7 \cdot 3^9 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$ : gap> fullCube := Group(U,L,R,F,B,D);
gap> Print(Size(fullCube));
88179840 It is, however, well known that the pocket cube only has $3674160=2^4 \cdot 3^8 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$ different positions. The thing that went wrong is that rotating the full cube yields (in our eyes) the same cube. However, in the group fullCube it would be a different position. Hence, the idea is to consider the subgroup generated by these ""full rotations"". gap> x := (5,8,7,6)(1,19,21,9)(2,20,22,10)(3,17,23,11)(4,18,24,12)(13,14,15,16); # turn front to top

gap> rotations := Group(x,y,z);

24 This looks good as the subgroup of rotations has $24=2^3 \cdot 3$ elements. So, if we factor fullCube by rotations we should get exactly the group we are looking for with the $3674160=88179840/24$ elements. Two elements in the group fullCube would be considered equal if and only if they represent the same position (without regarding the rotation of the entire cube). Let's try this and first check whether rotations is really a normal subgroup of fullCube : gap> Print(IsNormal(fullCube, rotations));
false Surprise (at least for me...), this is not a normal subgroup. So, we cannot consider the quotient group... This construction seems like the most natural approach for constructing the group. Why does this fail? Is there a way to fix it and still define the pocket cube group as a quotient group? Note that a different way to define the group would be to consider one of the corner pieces fixed and therefore only consider certain face rotations which generated the group: gap> cube := Group(U,L,B); # cube where bottom right cubie is fixed

The space $C(I)$ of continuous functions on $I$ is a closed linear subspace of $X$ if and only if there exists a positive constant $c$ satisfying $||\chi_{(a,b)}||_X$ $\geq$ $c$ whenever $0$ $\leq$ $a$ $\lt$ $b$ $\leq$ $1$ . (Mark this condition by ( $\star$ )). There is the proof: For sufficiency part it is enough to show that there is a positive constant $C$ such that for every $f$ $\in$ $C(I)$ , $C$$||f||_{C(I)}$ $\leq$ $||f||_X$ $\leq$ $||f||_{C(I)}$ . (Mark this by ( $\oplus$ )). The second of these inequalities is clear. For the first, let $f$ $\in$ $C(I)$ . There exists $x_0$ $\in$ $I$ such that $||f||_{C(I)}$ $=$ $|f(x_0)|$ ; there exists $\epsilon$ $\gt$ $0$ such that $|f(x_0)|$ $\leq$ $2|f(x)| $ if $x$ $\in$ $(x_0 - \epsilon,x_0 + \epsilon)$ $\cap$ $I$ : $=$ $E$ . Thus from $(\star)$ we see that $||f||_{C(I)}$ $=$ $|f(x_0)|$ $\leq$ $\frac {1}{c}$$|f(x_0)|$$||\chi_E||_X$ $\leq$ $\frac {2}{c}$$||f\chi_E||_X$ $\leq$ $\frac {2}{c}$ $||f||_X$ . Necessity. If $C(I)$ is a closed subset of $X$ , then by the closed graph theorem(there it is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_graph_theorem_(functional_analysis) , we have the estimate $(\oplus)$ . Let given any interval $(a,b)$ $\subset$ $I$ be given, if we take a continuous function $g$ on $I$ such that $g$ $\leq$ $\chi_{(a,b)}$ and $||g||_L^{\infty}$ $=$ $1$ we get $(\star)$ . There is my question: This theorem is on $X$ BFS on $[0,1]$ and on $C([0,1])$ space of continuous functions.
How could we proof that if this theorem is fair or false for $X$ BFS on $[0,1]^2$ ( Cartesian product) and on $C([0,1]^2)$ space of continuous functions. Any help would be appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'normed-spaces', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
4575862,Understanding a basic ergodic theory physical analogy,"The following excerpt is from the Wikipedia article on ergodic theory : Ergodic theory is often concerned with ergodic transformations. The intuition behind such transformations, which act on a given set, is that they do a thorough job ""stirring"" the elements of that set. E.g. if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout. At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.
The formal definition is as follows: Let $ T: X \rightarrow X$ be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ , with $\mu(X)=1$ . Then $T$ is ergodic if for every $E $ in $\Sigma$ with $\mu(T^{-1}(E) \Delta E)=0$ , either $\mu(E)=0$ or $\mu(E)=1$ , How could I formalize pouring the syrup into my oatmeal? Would I describe the oatmeal by a density function in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ? Say $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then I have some density describing the location of the oatmeal, say $\rho d\mu$ . Would the transformation be ergodic w.r.t. $$m(A) =\int_A fd\mu$$ or with resepct to $\mu$ ? When I describe the combination of the syrup and the oatmeal, would this create a new density at time $t$ ? This is confusing as I would assume the oatmeal and syrup have their own densities so I am unsure which measure the transformation is ergodic with respect to.","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'probability']"

4575990,Alternative Definition of Markov Property.,"currently I am trying to solve the following exercise (17.1.1) in Klenke Probability Theory, which states the following: Let $(X_t)_{t \in I}$ be a stochastic process and denote by $\mathcal{F}_{\leq t} = \sigma(X_s : s \in I, \; s \leq t)$ the sigma-algebra of the past until time $t$ , while $\mathcal{F}_{\geq t}$ denotes respectively the sigma-algebra of the future. Then one has the following equivalence: The process $(X_t)_{t \in I}$ admits the (elementary) Markov property iff both $\mathcal{F}_{\leq t}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{\geq t}$ are independent given $\sigma(X_t)$ , where the definition follows: Conditional Independence A family of sub-sigma algebras $(\mathcal{A}_i)_{i \in I} \subset \mathcal{F}$ is called independent of the sub-sigma algebra $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{F}$ if for every finite $J \subset I$ one has $$
P(\cap_{j \in J} A_j \mid \mathcal{A}) = \prod_{j \in J} P(A_j \mid \mathcal{A}) \quad \text{almost surely}.
$$ My try so far: For the first direction, suppose that $X$ admits the Markov Property then let $(A_j)_{j \in J} \subseteq \sigma(X_s)_{s \leq t}$ be a finite family of events from the sigma algebra of the past, observe that for $A = \cap_{j \in J} A_j$ one has almost surely $$
P(A \mid \sigma(X_t)) \stackrel{Def.}{=} E[ \mathbf{1}_A \mid \sigma(X_t) ] \stackrel{M.P}{=} E[ \mathbf{1}_A \mid \mathcal{F}_t ] = \mathbf{1}_A = \prod_{j \in J} \mathbf{1}_{A_j} = \prod_{j \in J} P(A_j \mid \mathcal{F}_t) \stackrel{M.P}{=} \prod_{j \in J} P(A_j \mid \sigma(X_t)),
$$ where we used that due to the filtration property $\mathbf{1}_{A_j}$ are $\mathcal{F}_t$ -measurable. Now for the sigma algebra of the future let again $(A_j)_{j \in J}$ be a finite family of events of $\mathcal{F}_{t \geq}$ then observe first that by the Markov Property one has $$
P(A \mid \sigma(X_t) ) \stackrel{M.P}{=} P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_t) \stackrel{Def.}{=} E[\mathbf{1}_{A} \mid \mathcal{F}_t],

4575991,Every $\sigma$-finite measure is absolutely continuous w.r.t. some finite measure,"I'm trying to prove below theorem mentioned in this comment . This theorem allows us to generalize this property from finite measure spaces to $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces. Theorem: Let $(X, \mathcal A, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$ -finite measure space. There is a finite measure $\nu$ on $(X, \mathcal A)$ such that $\mu$ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $\nu$ . Could you have a check on my bellow attempt? Proof: Let $(X_m)$ be a countable measurable partition of $X$ such that $\mu(X_m) <\infty$ . We define a measure $\mu_n$ by $$
\mu_n (A) :=  \mu(A \cap X_m) \quad \forall A \in \mathcal A.
$$ Then $\mu_n$ is finite and supported on $X_n$ . We define a measure $\nu_n$ by $$
\nu_n(A) := \frac{\mu_n(A)}{2^{n}\mu_n(X_n)}.
$$ Then $\mu_n \ll \nu_n$ and $\nu_n(X) = 2^{-n}$ . By Radon–Nikodym theorem , there is  a measurable function $f_n:X \to [0, \infty)$ such that $$
\mu_n(A) = \int_A f \mathrm d \nu_n(A) \quad \forall A \in \mathcal A.
$$ Because $\nu_n$ is supported on $X_n$ , we can assume $f_n=0$ on $X \setminus X_n$ . Let $f := \sum_n f_n$ . Then $f$ is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ w.r.t. $\nu :=\sum_n \nu_n$ . Notice that $$
\nu(X) = \sum_n \nu_n(X_n) = \sum_n 2^{-n} = 1.

4576029,Finding the CDF of a transformation of a random variable without first finding its PDF,"This is in the context of random variables and their transformations. Given a random variable $X$ , its probability density function (PDF) $f_{X}$ , and another random variable $Y$ , which is a a function of $X$ , how do I calculate the cumulative density function (CDF) of $Y$ (without first finding the PDF of $Y$ )? Below is a question and my solution: $\\$ Question: The PDF of a random variable $X$ is $f_{X}(x) =\begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{3}&,& -2 < x < 1\\ 0&,&\text{ elsewhere }\end{cases}$ . Find the CDF of $Y$ where $Y=X^{4}$ . $\\$ My solution: From the PDF of $X$ , we get the CDF of $X$ by using $F_X(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t)\space dt$ . This comes out to be: $F_{X}(x)=\begin{cases}0&,& x <-2\\ \dfrac{x+2}{3}&,& -2\leq x <1\\ 1&,& x\geq 1\end{cases}$ . $\\$ Since $X\in (-2, 1)$ here, and $Y=X^{4}$ , hence $Y\in [0, 16)$ . $\\$ Finding the CDF of $Y=X^{4}$ , that is, $F_{Y}(y)$ : $\begin{align}F_{Y}(y) &= P(Y \leq y) \\ &= P(X^{4} \leq y) \end{align}$ $\\$ Firstly, for $\space $ $-2 < x < 0 \space$ ( $\equiv \space 0 < y < 16$ ), we have $X=-Y^{1/4}$ (since $X$ is negative for these values of $Y$ ). So, $\begin{align} F_{Y}(y) &= P(-y^{1/4}\leq X <0) \\ &=\int ^{0}_{-y^{1/4}}f_{x}(x)\space dx \\ &= \dfrac{x}{3}\Bigg|_{x\space =\space -y^{1/4}}^{x\space =\space 0} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{3}y^{1/4}\end{align}$ $\\$ Now, for $\space $ $0 \le x < 1 \space$ ( $\equiv \space 0 \le y < 1$ ), we have $X=Y^{1/4}$ (since $X$ is non-negative for these values of $Y$ ). So, $\begin{align}F_{Y}(y) &= P(0 \leq X <y^{1/4}) \\ &=\int ^{y^{1/4}}_{0}f_{x}(x)\space dx \\ &= \dfrac{x}{3}\Bigg|_{x\space =\space 0}^{x\space =\space y^{1/4}} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{3}y^{1/4}\end{align}$ $\\$ Combining the above two results, I am getting: (1). For $0 \le y < 1$ : $\space F_{Y}(y) = \dfrac{2}{3}y^{1/4}$ , and, (2). For $1 \le y < 16$ : $\space F_{Y}(y) = \dfrac{1}{3}y^{1/4}$ . The second one above is clearly wrong since it is $\textbf{not}$ giving $\space F_{Y}(16^-) = 1$ , while the first one is correct (as confirmed by the answer that I have). What have I missed here while finding the CDF of $Y$ ? I know we can first find the PDF of $Y=X^{4}$ using a transformation formula and then find its CDF from its PDF, but I do not want to solve this using that formula.","['cumulative-distribution-functions', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'transformation', 'density-function']"

We have $$f'(x)=\arcsin'{(x)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ Let $g(x)=(1+x)^\alpha$ . Then, for $|x|<1$ and any $\alpha$ , $$g(x)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k$$ That is, $g$ can be represented as an infinite series, the binomial series. Note that this infinite series is a convergent power series centered at $0$ . Hence, it must be the Taylor series of $g$ at $0$ . Using this fact we can show that for $|x|<1$ , $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{-1/2}{k}x^{2k}$$ Thus, for $|x|<1$ , $$f'(x)=\arcsin'{(x)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{-1/2}{k}x^{2k}$$ If we integrate we obtain the result $$f(x)=\arcsin{(x)}=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{-1/2}{k}\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}$$ Which, if true, means we have another convergent power series centered at $0$ so we have found the desired Taylor series of $\arcsin$ at $0$ . My question is : how do we justify this integration step? If we prove that the sequence of functions $$\{f_n'\}=\left\{\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \binom{-1/2}{k}x^{2k}\right\}$$ converges uniformly to $\arcsin'$ on some interval, then I know of a theorem that says that $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_a^b f_n' =\int_a^b \arcsin'$$ This seems like it might involve a lot of calculations. Nonetheless, would it be a valid justification? We could also just use the fact that $\arcsin'$ is continuous and use the first fundamental theorem of calculus.

4576075,"Laplace transforms of Appell functions F1, F2, F3, F4 relative to one of the two variables","Appell's two-variable functions $F_1, F_2, F_3$ and $F_4$ are known to have numerous uses in applied mathematics, notably mathematical Physics. I am looking for generalized Laplace transforms (if they exist) of these functions relative to one of the two variables (I found at least two references that give some of them relative to a linear combination of the two variables). In more formal words, the question is about finding closed forms for: $$ I_1 = \int_0^\infty x^\alpha e^{-s \, x} F_{1}(a, b, c, d; x, y) \, dx$$ $$ I_2 = \int_0^\infty x^\alpha e^{-s \, x} F_{2}(a, b, c, d, e; x, y) \, dx$$ $$ I_3 = \int_0^\infty x^\alpha e^{-s \, x} F_{3}(a, b, c, d, e; x, y) \, dx$$ $$ I_4 = \int_0^\infty x^\alpha e^{-s \, x} F_{4}(a, b, c, d; x, y) \, dx,$$ where $\alpha, s, a, b, c, d, e$ are the parameters and $x, y$ the variables. The only reliable hint I could find is in Harold Exton's handbook ([2]), where Exton gives a method for finding the Laplace transform of $F_1$ using Mellin-Barnes integral representations of $F_1$ . Unfortunately, he did not complete the argument: ""page 99: (...) We make use of the double Barnes integral for the Appell function F1 given by Appell and Kampé de Fériet (1926p page 40. This is $$F_1(a,b,b',c;x,y) = \frac{\Gamma(c)}{(2 \pi i)^2 \Gamma(a) \Gamma(b) \Gamma(b')} \int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty}\int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty} \frac{\Gamma(a+u+v)\Gamma(b+u)\Gamma(b'+v)\Gamma(-u)\Gamma(-v)(-x)^u (-y )^v}{\Gamma(c+u+v)} \, du \, dv$$ (5.2.4.26) Some indication is now given as to the evaluation of the Laplace integral of the function $F_1$ [Exton proceeds, interchanging the order of integration and evaluating the inner integral as a gamma function, which gives:] $$P = \frac{(2 \pi i)^2 \Gamma(c) \Gamma(d) \Gamma(d')}{\Gamma(f)} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-s\, t} t^{a-1} F_1(c, d, d', f; xt, yt) \, dt \, \\=  \frac{\Gamma(a)}{s^a} \ \int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty}\int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty} \frac{\Gamma(c+u+v) \Gamma(a+u+v) \Gamma(d+u) \Gamma(d'+v) \Gamma(-u) \Gamma(-v) (-x)^u (-y )^v}{\Gamma(f+u+v)} (-\frac{x}{s})^u (-\frac{y}{s})^v\, du \, dv$$ (5.2.4.28)
In order to obtain a representation of this last result in terms of convergent series, the above integral may be written as an integral of Barnes type of a [Meijer] G-function of one variable. Some rather lengthy manipulation eventually leads to the sum of six double hypergeometric series of higher order with argument $s/x$ and $s/y$ . Exton did not give the six series alluded to but only special cases of interest expressed using Kampé de Feriet functions or generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable. He also only considered the case in which both function variables $x$ and $y$ are linked to the Laplace transform by the same integration variable $t$ , but his method is obviously valid if only one variable is linked (so with no $t$ as a multiplier of $y$ in $F_1(c, d, d', f; xt, y)$ for example).
The method looks fine and I have looked around for whether there is any paper giving the forms (probably in Meijer-G representations), without success so far. In any case, series representations should not be used, except for heuristic hints: their domain of convergence is too limited for the Laplace transforms to be defined. But Euler-type integral representations and, as in Exton's book, Mellin-Barnes integral representations could be considered (as analytic continuations giving meaning to the Laplace transforms) or possibly expressions as a series of Gauss hypergeometric functions, since these can have Laplace transforms (see here ).
Again, these may well have been published, but I failed to find anything that neatly answers the question. [2]: Exton, Harold , Handbook of hypergeometric integrals.

4576184,Integral Involving Harmonic Numbers: $\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(x^{4}-1\right)}{x^{2}-1}dx$,"(Motivation) In an attempt to answer this question , I got stuck on evaluating a certain integral. I have made up the following conjecture: $$\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(x^{4}-1\right)}{x^{2}-1}dx = \frac{\pi^{2}}{4}+\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(2\right)\ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt{3}-1}\right).$$ (Attempt) Let $H_n$ denote the n-th harmonic number $\displaystyle H_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}$ . I will warn this process gets ugly, but it is the best I have so far. Expanding the integrand as a series, we get: $$
\eqalign{
\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(x^{4}-1\right)}{x^{2}-1}dx &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{4\ln\left(x\right)-H_{n}}{x^{4n+2}}dx+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{4\ln\left(x\right)-H_{n}}{x^{4n+4}}dx, \cr
}
$$ which simplifies down to $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{H_{n}\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{-4n-1}-\frac{4\ln\left(\sqrt{3}\right)\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{-4n-1}+\frac{4\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{\left(-4n-1\right)^{2}}\right)+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{H_{n}\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{-4n-3}-\frac{4\ln\left(\sqrt{3}\right)\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{-4n-3}+\frac{4\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{\left(-4n-3\right)^{2}}\right).$$ Since both series converge, we can split up the first series like $$-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{4n+1}+4\ln\left(\sqrt{3}\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{4n+1}+4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{\left(4n+1\right)^{2}}$$ and the second series like $$-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{4n+3}+4\ln\left(\sqrt{3}\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{4n+3}+4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{\left(4n+3\right)^{2}}.$$ Next, I found that $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-1}}{4n+1}=\frac{\pi}{12}+\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)$$ and $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{3}^{-4n-3}}{4n+3}=\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)-\frac{\pi}{12}.$$ However, after trying for a while, I am out of ideas for evaluating the other sums. I realize I skipped a lot of steps, but that is because I don't want this question to be too long. So for your convenience, I put all of these into Desmos , so I believe my process is correct so far based on numerical approximations. (Question) Does anyone have an idea of how to evaluate the integral in question, or how to evaluate the sums I am stuck on? Any hints and ideas are appreciated. (Miscellaneous) Here are some other ideas I have: $$
\eqalign{
\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(x^{4}-1\right)}{x^{2}-1}dx &= \int_{\operatorname{arcsec}\left(\sqrt{3}\right)}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\ln\left(\left(\sec x\right)^{4}-1\right)}{\sec^{2}x-1}\sec\left(x\right)\tan\left(x\right)dx \cr
\int_{\sqrt{3}}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(x^{4}-1\right)}{x^{2}-1}dx &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(\left(x+\sqrt{3}\right)^{4}-1\right)}{\left(x+\sqrt{3}\right)^{2}-1}dx.

Thank you so much for your help! Proof: Let $\mu$ be $\sigma$ -finite. We need the following lemma as a bridge, i.e., Lemma Let $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$ -finite measure space. There is a finite measure $\nu$ on $(\Omega, \Sigma)$ such that $\mu$ has a density $f:X \to (0, \infty)$ w.r.t. $\nu$ . Let $(f, \nu)$ be given by the Lemma .

g \in L_{q}(\nu, X^*) \iff \int |g|^q \mathrm d \nu = \int  |f^{-1/q}g|^q \mathrm d \mu <\infty \iff f^{-1/q}g \in L_{q}(\mu, X). \quad (\star\star)
$$ We define $$
\phi: L_{q} (\nu, X^*) \to L_{q} (\mu, X^*), g \mapsto f^{-1/q}g.

4576465,"In probability theory, how may we define a law (without need of defining a random variable first)?","Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability triple. The following definitions are from the third chapter of William's Probability with Martingales . (Definition of a distribution function and law given a random variable ) Definition: given a random variable $X$ , we define its distribution $F_X:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ and law $\mathcal{L}_X:\mathcal{B}\to[0,1]$ (which is a probability measure) by \begin{equation}
\label{rel rv d l}
F_X(c) := \mathcal{L}_X(-\infty,c] := P(X\le c) = P\{\omega :X(\omega)\le c\}.
\end{equation} (Definition of a distribution function in general ) Definition: a distribution function $F$ is a function $\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ such that (a) $F$ is monotonically increasing. (b) $\lim_{x\to -\infty} F(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x\to \infty} F(x) = 1$ . (c) $F$ is right-continuous. The two definitions above gives us the following: a function $F$ is a distribution function if and only if there is some random variable $X$ so that $F=F_X:=c\mapsto P(X\le c)$ . With all this in mind, I wonder how may we define a Law $\mathcal{L}$ in general so as to make the following statement true: A function $\mathcal{L}$ is a law if and only if there is some random variable $X$ so that $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_X:=(-\infty,c]\mapsto P(X\le c)$ . Perhaps I should mention that there is a 'trivial' way of answering the question: a law $\mathcal{L}$ is defined as a function $\mathcal{B}\to[0,1]$ such that there exists a distribution $F$ with $F(c) = \mathcal{L}(-\infty,c]$ for any $c\in\mathbb{R}$ .

4576471,Show that a Levy measure $\nu$ (which arises from a convergence of Infinitely Divisible random vectors) is such that $\int x d\nu(x)=0$,"Let $(X_{jn})_{1\leq j \leq n}$ be a triangular array of $p-$ dimensional random vectors (row independent). Suppose $X_{jn} \sim \mu_{jn}$ and 1. $\,\, E X_{jn}= \int_{\mathbb R^p} x d \mu_{jn}=0$ 2. $\,\,\lim_{n \to \infty} \max_{1\leq j \leq n} P(|X_{jn}|> \epsilon)=0$ , for all $\epsilon > 0$ 3. $\,\,var(S_n):=\sum_{j=1}^n \int_{\mathbb R^p} |x|^2 d\mu_{jn} \leq C < \infty$ , for all $n \in \mathbb N$ . Assume that $S_n := \sum_{j=1}^n X_{jn} \Longrightarrow X $ , form some $X$ . Now, consider $Y_{jn} \sim CP(1,\mu_{jn})$ [ compound Poisson distribution, where the paramenter of the Poisson r.v. is $\lambda =1$ for all $(j,n)$ and the coumpounded vectors  are copies of $X_{jn}$ ]. Define $$S_n' := \sum_{j=1}^n Y_{jn}$$ It is easy to show that $E[S_n']=E[S_n]=0$ and $var[S_n']=var[S_n]$ . Moreover, we can show that the characteristic function of $S'_n$ is given by: $$\varphi_{S_n'}(u)=\exp\left\{ \int_{\mathbb R^p} \left[e^{iu'x} - 1 \right] d\nu_n \right\} = \exp\left\{ \int_{\mathbb R^p} \left[e^{iu'x} - 1 - iu'x \right] d\nu_n \right\}, \quad \nu_n(E):= \sum_{j=1}^n \int_E d\mu_{jn}, \quad E\, \,\hbox{ borelian set.}$$ By an argument of Accompanying Law (section 3.7 from the Varadhan' lecture notes ), we have that $S_n = \sum_{j=1}^n X_{jn} \Longrightarrow X $ if and only if $$S_n'= \sum_{j=1}^n Y_{jn} \Longrightarrow X $$ Using the theorem 8.7, page 41, from the Sato's book , we have $X$ is  Infinitely Divisible (I.D.) and its characteristic function is: $$\varphi_{X}(u) = \exp\left\{ \frac{- u'\sigma u}{2} + \int_{\mathbb R^p} \left[e^{iu'x} - 1 - iu'x \right] d\nu \right\}.$$ Moreover, $$\int f d\nu_n \to \int f d\nu \quad (n \to \infty),\quad \forall f \in \mathcal C_\#$$ ( $\mathcal C_\#$ is the class of continuous and bounded functions vanishing on a neighborhood of $0$ ). The mentioned theorem has another implication involving $\sigma$ , but I don't think it will be useful to mention it. According to this question , the last integral convergence is equivalent to \begin{equation}\label{asd}\tag{I}
\nu_n(E) \to \nu(E), \quad \forall E \in \mathcal{C}_\nu, \,\, 0 \notin \bar E
\end{equation} Where $\bar E$ is clousure of the borelian $E$ . Question: Since $\int_{\mathbb R^p} x d\nu_n = \sum_{j=1}^n \int_{\mathbb R^p} x d\mu_{jn} = 0$ for all $n$ , I suspect that $\int_{\mathbb R^p} x d\nu = 0$ .  How to show this? Although each $\nu_n$ is not a probability measure (since $\nu_n$ is a sum of $n$ probability measures), convergence in (\ref{asd}) looks a lot like a weak convergence of measures. Furthermore, given that $\sup_n \int x^2d\nu_n(x) < C $ , I could apply some similar uniform integrability result to conclude that $\int x d\nu_n(x) \to \int x d\nu (x)$ . Given that $\int x d\nu_n(x) =0$ , I would have the desired result. But I don't know how to do this rigorously. Update As said before, the mentioned theorem has another implication involving $\sigma$ and it was my fault for not specifying. Allow me to add it. First, for any $\epsilon>0$ , define the symetric non-neg-definite matrix $\sigma_{n,\epsilon}$ as  (actually, this involves a certain $\sigma_n$ , but in this case it's zero): \begin{equation}\label{new}\tag{II}
\langle u, \sigma_{n,\epsilon}u \rangle :=  \int_{|x|\leq \epsilon}\langle u ,x\rangle^2 d\nu_n(x), \quad u \in \mathbb R^p
\end{equation} Then: \begin{equation}\label{new2}\tag{III}
\lim_{\epsilon \downarrow 0} \limsup_{n \to \infty} \left| \langle u, \sigma_{n,\epsilon}u \rangle -  \langle u, \sigma u \rangle \right|=0

4576525,Dice game: bidding for sum,"Consider the following two-player game. Both players roll a fair die. They can see their own roll, but not their opponent's roll. Then, both players simultaneously choose a (possibly fractional) amount to bid. Whoever bids higher wins the sum of the two die rolls minus their bid, while the lower bidder gains nothing. When they bid the same amount, both players get nothing. What is the best strategy for this game? What are the Nash equilibria? Let n be the number you roll, then the random variable for the sum is uniform between $[n+1, n+6]$ . The expected value for the opponent’s roll is 3.5 and so the expected sum would be $n + 3.5$ , I will bid as close to the expected sum as possible (so the first whole number that is below the expected sum $n + 3.5$ ), which would give me an expected payoff of $0.5$ . Is this solution correct? I don't know if adding the expected value part is the best strategy, but I assume I want to lower the chance of the opponent getting around the expected value. Edit: The question was not clear about whether the bid is announced to the other player, but since if it is announced we have to consider the sequence (whether I am first or second), I assume the bids are secret. Though I want to know what the strategies would be for the two different cases (secret and non-secret), if I can choose to bid first/second? You can bid any amount and the opponent is a rational player. To give an example of the run, you got 3 and your‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‍‍‌‍‍‍ opponent got 6, and if you bid 7 and the opponent bids 8, whoever wins the bid will get 9 points minus the points they bid, so the opponent wins and get 1 point in this case.
