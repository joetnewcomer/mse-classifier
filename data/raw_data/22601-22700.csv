193559,Eigenvalues for Sturm Liouville problems and more general ODE/PDE Problems,"I'm struggling to find a geometric, or at least some intuitive understanding of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in Sturm-Liouville problems (which I've been looking at in a PDE course). For instance, for the Sturm-Liouville problem: $$(p(x)\phi')'+q(x)\phi+\lambda\sigma(x)\phi=0$$ with boundary conditions of course, I struggle to see why this rather arbitrarily placed $\lambda$ deserves the high honour of being called an eigenvalue. And then we solve for $\phi$ and call it an eigenfunction. In linear algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a transformation have a number of nice geometric interpretations, and frankly I feel quite comfortable in seeing their importance in that setting, but I'm unsure why we can prescribe this terminology here. In the course I'm taking we're making a great deal of fuss about non-negativity of eigenvalues, the orthogonality of eigenfunctions, etc., etc., but while I can follow the various proofs algebraically I must admit I feel quite lost without this basic understanding.

193583,Discrete Analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,"In Saber Elaydi's book ""An Introduction to Difference Equations"" , 3rd ed., Sec. 2.1 (page 59), the discrete analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is stated:

Moreover, it is well-known that for the case $k=2$, this pairwise commutativity condition is also a sufficient condition for symmetry of the matrix product.

193644,Rounding non-integer values to integer values without causing an 'overflow',"The following problem comes from a piece of software I am currently working on, but since it's partially a mathematical problem, I'll ask the question here. In my application I have a fixed value (e.g. 1000) which needs to be divided into multiple different values.  The problem is that the algorithm (in another application) that divides the value returns non-integer values, and the nature of my current application requires integer values. If the starting value is divided in two values, this shouldn't be a problem in most cases.  E.g. if 1000 is divided in 600.6 and 399.4, then I can safely round this and get 601 and 399, which still sum up to 1000. However, if the value is divided in more than 2 values, I cannot simply round the results, as this may cause an overflow or a slack.  E.g. if 1000 is divided in: 300.6 300.6 398.8 Then rounding these values give me: 301, 301 and 399, which sums up to 1001. In my application I could decide to round down everything, which would give me 300, 300 and 398.  Although the sum is not 1000 anymore, in my case a smaller value (slack) is more acceptible than a larger value (overflow). Are there any known tricks in number theory that provide better rouding mechanisms so this problem can be minimized?  E.g. by using information about statistical distribution of numbers/digits? Notice that: I can't change the original division algorithm I can't try to sum up the values myself and manually change one of the input values (in my situation the starting value could be divided in hundreds, thousands or even millions of different values) I can only change the rounding method Thanks in advance","['statistics', 'number-theory']"

For the case when $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{b_{n}}{b_{n+1}}=1$ it is required more research in order to be sure that we can safely apply the first converse theorem. I'll make

    i = i + 1 How many times do we expect the loop to be executed? I expect $O(\log N)$ times myself: every round, we expect about half of the remaining numbers to be removed, which should result in $O(\log N)$ rounds. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to prove this. Markov's inequality trivially gives you that you will only throw away a constant fraction with constant probability, but if you wish this to happen $O(\log N)$ times in a row, your probability estimate goes to 0 as $N$ goes to infinity. Apparently (while I was randomly looking through books for help) the above problem is quite suited to a Markov chain formulation, except I am not familiar with them and have no idea how to use that to get the expected value I want. When the book told me I was supposed to evaluate determinants through Cramer's rule and provided an example which was not at all clear to me, I gave up. The above problem came up when analyzing a probable counterexample for an algorithm I have been working on. The actual probabilities involved are not uniformly random, but I think the above problem captures the essence of my problems, so an answer would probably help me enough to solve my own problem.

193896,"Is there a ""homomorphism/isomorphism"" (conceptually) between $\mathbb{C - R}$ and $\mathbb{R - Q}$","The Background:
I was thinking about ways to conceptualize the way rational and irrational numbers interact within the real line while helping somebody in an elementary real analysis class. It came to my mind that one way of thinking about this was to represent an irrational number x as: $$r \in \mathbb{Q}$$ $$i \in \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$$
$$r + i = x$$ As a notational simplification from this point let $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} := \mathbb{I}$
and also: $\mathbb{C} - \mathbb{R} = \hat{\mathbb{C}}$
I then noticed that there were some similarities (and differences between this set under real-number addition and multiplication and C when the real line was deleted) mainly: $$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{I}$$
$$\forall z,w \in \hat{\mathbb{C}}$$ $$a + b = r_a + r_b +i_a + i_b = r_c + i_c = c \in \mathbb{R}$$
similar to:
$$z + w = \mathcal{Re}(z) +\mathcal{Re}(w) + i(\mathcal{Im}(z) +\mathcal{Im}(w)) = u \in \mathbb{C}$$ 
and
$$ab = (r_a + i_a)(r_b + i_b) = r_ar_b + r_ai_b+ i_ar_b + i_ai_b = r_c + i_c \in \mathbb{R}$$
similar to:
$$zw = \mathcal{Re}(z)\mathcal{Re}(w) - \mathcal{Im}(z)\mathcal{Im}(w) + i(\mathcal{Re}(z)\mathcal{Im}(w) + \mathcal{Re}(w)\mathcal{Im}(z)) = u \in {\mathbb{C}}$$ The primary difference I noticed between this and complex number arithmetic was that the value $i_ai_b$ could be rational or irrational, and the sign change. It also seemed to me that there would be a way to compensate for these differences in some homomorphism/isomorphism between $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ and $\mathbb{I}$ or alternatively maybe just one quadrant of $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ I am aware that multiplication and addition lack closure (that is the product/sum of two rationals can be irrational, and the product/sum of two complex numbers can be real), and 
that there is also no additive or multiplicative identity present in either set (which is why I think such a homomorphism/isomorphism may exist in the first place). I figure if such an homomorphism/isomorphism does exist then it will make explaning the lack of these properties in $\mathbb{I}$ easier when talking to student with some experience with complex algebra, but little analysis background. (as well as provide an interesting little tidbit to toss around) The Question:
Has anyone seen a construction that of a homomorphism/isomorphism between $\mathbb{C - R}$ and $\mathbb{R - Q}$, or can anybody point me in the right direction for developing one? Alternatively is there a counter-argument that disproves this possibility that I'm missing somewhere? I'm also looking for more of a conceptual notion of homomorphism/isomorphism than a particular one (since these sets don't have nice algebraic properties, or the identity elements that make such a construction a homomorphism in traditional definitions).","['complex-analysis', 'abstract-algebra']"

Using Cauchy:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}{^n\sqrt{\frac{2^n}{n}}}$$
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{^n\sqrt{2^n}}{^n\sqrt{n}}}$$
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{2}{1}} = 2$$ And then, it follows that

if $\gamma(t)=\langle x(t),y(t)\rangle$, then it seems natural to want to write \begin{align}
&\int_{\gamma}\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}dx-\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}dy\\

Note that $r_{3}\ge 14$ because it is possible to draw three ellipses dividing the plane into 14 regions. More generally
$$r_{n}\ge 2n^{2}-2n+2,$$ 
since $n$ ellipses divide the plane into at most $2n^{2}-2n+2$ regions, and this happens if and only if any two ellipses intersect in 4 points and any three have empty intersection (Check this , and also this post has a related question).

As outlined in the thread above, the probability $p(L)$ of you eventually matching your friend is given by the recurrence relation $$p(L) = \frac{1}{2^{L-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} \frac{p(L+i)}{2^i}.$$ Other than the trivial observation that $p(L) = 1$ is a solution to this recurrence, I haven't been able to make headway.

194125,The aim in a course of differential equations?,"As I used to understand the primary aim of a student learning differential equations is that given a differential equation he should be able to solve it. However while recently reading a note on the history of differential equations I came across the following paragraph: A new era began with the foundation of what is now called function theory by Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass. The study and classification of functions according to their essential properties, as distinguished from the accidents of their analytical forms, soon led to a complete revolution in the theory of differential equations. It became evident that the real question raised by a differential equation is not whether a solution, assumed to exist, can be expressed by means of known functions , or integrals of known functions, but in the first place whether a given differential equation does really suffice for the definition of a function of the independent variable (or variables), and, if so, what are the characteristic properties of the function thus defined. Few things in the history of mathematics are more remarkable than the developments to which this change of view has given rise. My questions are: How did that become evident? What remarkable changes has this point of view brought about? Thanks.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'math-history']"

We say that $C$ intersects itself at P, if for all parametrizations $f: [a,b] \to C$ (which are of the same $C^k$ class as C), the equation $f(x)=P$ has at least two solutions in $[a,b]$.

194230,Elementary set theory homework proofs,"I've been given some statements to prove using only the following facts. The set of all integers is countably infinite. Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and suppose $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is surjective. If $X$ is countable, then $Y$ is also countable. The union of a countably infinite family of sets is countable. I'd like your opinion on my proofs. I feel like the first could be simpler. Exercise 1. The set $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. Proof. Let $A_n=\{n\}\times\mathbb{Z}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Define a mapping $f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A_n$ by $f(x)=(n,x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Z}$. To see that $f$ is surjective, consider $(n,p)\in A_n$. Since $p\in\mathbb{Z}$, $f(p)=(n,p)$. Thus, $f$ is surjective. By (2), since (1) $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable, $A_n$ is countable. Let $S=\{A_n:n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Notice that $S$ is infinite since it is indexed over $\mathbb{Z}$. Define $g:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow S$ by $g(x)=A_x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Z}$. To see that $g$ is surjective, consider $A_q\in S$. Since $q\in\mathbb{Z}$, $g(q)=A_q$. Thus, $g$ is surjective. By (2), $S$ is countable. Thus, $S$ is a countably infinite family of countable sets. Let $U=\bigcup S$. Then, by (3), $U$ is countable. To see that $U=\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, we will show that $U$ and $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ are subsets of each other. Let $x\in U$. Then $x\in A_n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Hence, $x=(n,p)$ for some $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $x=(n,p)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, and it follows that $U\subseteq\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Let $x\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Then $x=(p,q)$ for some $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $x\in A_p$, which implies that $x\in U$. Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\subseteq U$, and it follows that $U=\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. Exercise 2. Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable. Proof. Let $X$ be a countable set and let $Y$ be an infinite subset of $X$. Then $X$ is countably infinite and there exists a surjection $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow X$. Since $Y\subseteq X$ and $Y$ is nonempty, there exists a surjection $g:X\rightarrow Y$. Thus, $gf:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow Y$ is a surjection. Therefore, by (2), $Y$ is countable.","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"

($K_n$ is the complete graph with $n$ vertices) So far, I think I've come up with a proof. We know the total number of edges in $K_n$ is $n(n-1)/2$ (or $n \choose 2$) and we can split our graph into individual Hamiltonian cycles of degree 2. We also know that for n vertices all having degree 2, there must consequently be $n$ edges. Thus we write $n(n-1)/2 = n + n + ... n$ (here I'm just splitting $K_n$'s edges into some number of distinct Hamiltonian paths) and the deduction that $n$ must be odd follows easily. However, the assumption I made - that we can always split $K_n$ into Hamiltonian paths of degree 2 if $K_n$ can be written as a disjoint union described above - I'm having trouble proving. I've only relied on trying different values for $n$ trials and it hasn't faltered yet. So, I'm asking: If it is true, how do you prove that if $K_n$ can be split into distinct Hamiltonian cycles, it can be split in such a way that each Hamiltonian cycle is of degree 2?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I'm trying to understand Klenke 's proof of the ""existence"" part of this proposition, namely that given a Q-Matrix $q$ , there exists a Markov process $\mathfrak{X}$ , whose Q-Matrix is $q$ . ( Theorem 17.25 , see below) Listed below is the beginning of his proof (the rest, which is irrelevant to my current question, can be found here ). What i fail to figure out is how to show that $\mathfrak{X}$ (defined in the proof below) is a Markov process. I recalled Klenke's definition of a Markov process in a previous post . Relevant definitions Let $E$ be a non-empty, countable set. A Q-Matrix in $E$ is a function $q:E\times E\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that i) $q(e,d)\geq0$ for all $e,d\in E$ such that $e\ne d$ , ii) $q(e,e)=-\sum_{e\neq d}q(e,d)$ , iii) $0<\lambda:=\sup_{e\in E}|q(e,e)|<\infty$ Given an $E$ -valued stochastic process $X=(X_t)_{t\in[0,\infty)}$ and a function $q:E\times E\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ , $q$ is the Q-matrix of $X$ iff for all $e,d\in E$ $$\lim_{t\downarrow0}\frac{1}{t}\left(\mathrm{P}_e[X_t=d]-\delta_{e,d}\right)=q(e,d)$$ ( $\delta$ is Kronecker's delta ) Theorem 17.25 $q$ is a Q-matrix $\implies$ $q$ is the Q-matrix of a unique Markov process. Proof (This is only the beginning of Klenke's proof; the rest can be found here .) Let $I$ be the unit matrix on $E$ . Define $$p(e,d):=\frac{1}{\lambda}q(e,d)+I(e,d)\space\space\mathrm{for\, }e,d\in E.$$ Then $p$ is a stochastic matrix and $q=\lambda(p-I)$ .
