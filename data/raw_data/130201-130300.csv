2021813,"Every morphism from Spec $R$ to $X$ factors through Spec $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ where $R$ is a local ring","Let $R$ be a local ring, and $X$ be any scheme. Prove that every morphism from Spec $R$ to $X$ factors through Spec $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$. I know the proof of the similar question when $R$ is a field (see here ) and I try to do the same thing. But in this case I can only get a ring morphism from $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ to $R/p$= $\mathcal{O}_{SpecR,p}$, where p is a prime ideal.

2021838,Why does Intermediate Value Theorem only consider end-points?,"The IVT says that, given a closed interval of real numbers, $[a, b]$, and a real-valued function $f$ continuous on $[a,b]$, for any point $z\in [f(a), f(b)]$ (WLOG, $f(a) < f(b)$), there exist a point $c\in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = z$. Now, I'm wondering, why is the theorem only applicable to $z\in[f(a), f(b)]$ and not to $z\in [\min\limits_{x\in [a,b]}\{f(x)\},\max\limits_{x\in [a,b]}\{f(x)\}]$?","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'functions']"

Show that $d(x,y)$ and ${d(x,y)\over d(x,y)+1}$ are topologically equivalent. I used the definition that metrics $f,g$ on metric spaces $(X,d/ q)$ are called equivalent if $U\subset X$ is open with respect to $f$ if and only if it is open with respect to $g$. I managed one direction: $q(x,y)\le d(x,y)$. Let $U\subset X$ be open with respect to $q$ and let $x\in U$. So there exists $r>0$ such that $B_q(x,r)\subset U$. For any $y\in X$, such that $d(x,y)<r$, $q(x,y)\le d(x,y)<r$. That implies that $y\in B_d(x,r)\Rightarrow y\in B_q(x,r)\Rightarrow B_{d}(x,r)\subset B_q(x,r)\subset U$ (So I hope.

2022120,Confusion over a question on relations,"I've been asked to explain why ""a binary relation, $R$, that is irreflexive and transitive will be anti-symmetric."" I started to think about the question by coming up with some relations that I understood to be both irreflexive and transitive. One of those was $R = \{(x,y), (y,z), (z,x), (x,z), (z,y), (y,x)\}$. This relation confuses me. If reflexivity is defined as $\forall x \in A(xRx)$ and there are no elements of the form $(x,x)$ contained within $R$, then it seems that $R$ is irreflexive. Transitivity is defined as $\forall x,y,z \in A (xRy \land yRz \to xRz)$. $R$ also appears to be transitive. How then can I show that all binary relations which are irreflexive and transitive are anti-symmetric, when the definition of symmetry ($\forall x,y \in A (xRy \to yRx)$) seems to hold for $R$? Is it correct for me to believe that $R$ is irreflexive, transitive and also symmetric?",['discrete-mathematics']

2022440,Parity of rows and columns of a rectangular table of binary digits,"I'm preparing for a Computer Science interview at Cambridge and I came across this question: With a rectangular table of binary digits it is always possible to add an extra row and an extra column so that every row and every column of the resulting table has an even number of ones and zeros in it. Explain why. Is it always possible to add a row and column to a table of binary digits where every row and every column of the resulting table has an odd number of binary digits? This is the answer: Parity Matrix Adding respectively an extra row or column to a table so that the parity of all columns or rows respectively is odd or even is always straightforward. Adding both at once adds one extra cell that is overspecified (at the intersection of extra column and row - at bottom right hand corner if we extend in length and to the right). The overspecification is not a conflict with even parity. This can be seen by considering every possible original table as a sum of a certain number of tables each with a single one in it and noting that addition of tables (using cell-by-cell xor) preserves even parity. Infact, it is soon clear that the conflicted cell is always clear. The overspecification is not a conflict with odd parity for certain table sizes. Another argument that works for even parity is based on the whether the tally of the unextended table is odd or even. The associativity of addition means that the same digit is required in the corner cell for even parity however you perform the tally. However, for odd parity, a virtual r or c additional ones have been summed, where r and c are the number of rows and columns in the original table. There is no conflict if r and c have the same parity. I can't understand the question or the answer. If we have the following table: ╔═════════════╗

So, this task is divided in some smaller tasks, and I'm supposed to begin with the following one: Show that the inequality holds for half-open intervals $A = [a_1, b_1)$ and $B = [a_2, b_2)$ with $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \in \Bbb R$ , $b_1 > a_1$ and $b_2 > a_2$ . I tried to do a case analysis, taking a look at $A \subset B$ , $A \cap B = \emptyset$ and $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ . Yet, I only came to the conclusion that, no matter what case I try to prove, that there is always only the equality between $A$ and $B$ . So, we know that $A + B = [a_1, b_1) + [a_2, b_2) = [a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2)$ . This leads to $\lambda(A + B) = \lambda([a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2)) = (b_1 + b_2) - (a_2 + a_1) = b_1 + b_2 - a_2 - a_1 = b_1 - a_1 + b_2 - a_2 = \lambda([a_1, b_1)) + \lambda([a_2, b_2)) = \lambda(A) + \lambda(B).$ Of course this doesn't contradict the statement above, but I guess there is more to show here. We are allowed to use the usual properties of a measure. Edit: So, basically, I couldn't find an example where the equality didn't hold. I guess this is exactly sub-task wats me to find? We later work with $A$ and $B $ being compact, so I might get a different result, but I'm not sure.

2022627,Why does this intuition for combinations with repetition fail?,"When you are learning the difference between combinations and permutations without repetition. The logic for each of them is: 1) Permutation without repetition: Selecting 4 objects from 10, gives $10*9*8*7$ choices. 2) Combinations without repetition: Selecting 4 objects from 10, gives $10*9*8*7/(4*3*2*1)$. Here you always divide by the number of times you can arrange 4 objects since each of those combinations are the same, order doesn't matter. 3) Permutations with repetition: selecting 4 objects from 10, is $10*10*10*10$ 4) Combinations with repetition Now trying to apply this to combinations with repetition, my reasoning is this. Its similar to how one goes from permutations to combinations in the case of no repetition.
There are 10 objects to choose from and you want to select 4. Each selection doesn't diminish the number of choices you have since its replacable. So for each possible selection you have 10 choices, selecting 4 then gives $10^4 / 4!$ since you need to divide by the number of ways 4 objects can be arranged to not overcount. I know this is wrong, I've seen solutions to this using stars and bars. But my question is basically, for the case of no repetition, combinations can be treated as permutations only if you divide by the number of ways you can arrange your selection, and that makes intuitive sense to me. When it comes to repetitions, permutations make sense to me. Selecting k objects from n choices is just $n^k$. So why cant I use the same reasoning here and say that the number of combinations is $n^k / k!$?","['intuition', 'combinatorics']"
2022638,Why did the integral eat the pi?,"I was reading this article which derives the value for integral of a negative exponent. I follow the derivation, from circular symmetry, to integration by substitution, and this is the resulting equation:

$$l(a)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{(-ax^2)} \, dx=\sqrt{\frac \pi a} \text{ for } \operatorname{Re}(a)>0\tag2$$ I understand that the bound became negative infinity because taking the square root gives negative solutions.

For $X\in\mathbf{LRS}$, there is a functor $S_X\colon\mathbf{SRng}\to\mathbf{Set}$ specified by $S_X(A)=\mathbf{LRS}(\operatorname{Spec}A,X)$, which induces a functor $S\colon\mathbf{LRS}\to\mathbf{Funct}(\mathbf{SRng},\mathbf{Set})$. (Notation: Given a category $\mathcal C$, $\mathcal C(X,Y)$ is the set of morphisms between $X,Y\in\mathcal C$. We assume that all categories are locally small) The theorem of existence of geometric realization, claims that $S$ has a left adjoint, called the geometric realization functor. In Demazure & Gabriel's Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Groups , they claim that it is a particular case of a well-known theorem of Kan. However, they sketch a proof for this special case. I wonder what is the well-known theorem of Kan in question? The proof they sketch works along the line that every functor $\mathbf{SRng}\to\mathbf{Set}$ is a colimit of representable functors (via category of elements), and for representable functors $\mathbf{SRng}(A,-)$, they just define the geometric realization as $\operatorname{Spec}A$.","['category-theory', 'schemes', 'algebraic-geometry']"

In all examples $(e_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ denotes the infinite sequence with zero in every entry apart from its $n$-th entry, which is one. Example $1$: Let $(e_n)_{n=1}^\infty\subset\ell^2$. Then $(e_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ does not converge strongly anywhere. But since $(\ell ^2)'$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\ell^2$ we can represent every $f\in(\ell^2)'$ as the action of some $a\in \ell^2$ on another $x\in\ell^2$. Letting $f:=f_a$ we have that then $f_a(x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_kx_k$. We then have that $f(e_n)=a_n$. My notes then go on to say that if $a\in\ell^2$ then $a_n\to0$ as $n\to\infty$ and $x_n\rightharpoonup x$ in $\ell^2$. It is at this last sentence that I am lost. I understand that $f(e_n)=a_n$, but how does the fact that $a\in\ell^2$ allow us to deduce that $a_n\to0$ as $n\to\infty$ and then in turn allow us to establish the weak convergence? Example $2$: Take $(e_n)_{n=1}^\infty\subset\ell^1$. Then for every $f\in(\ell^1)'$ we can define similarly to what we done above $f:=f_a$ for some $a\in\ell^\infty$. But then my notes say that $f_a(e_n)=a_n$ does not have to go to zero as $n\to\infty$. From which point it then goes on to say that it is not true that $e_n\rightharpoonup 0$ in $\ell^1$. Again, similar to the last example, I am completely lost on the latter part of the example. Why in this case for $a\in\ell^\infty$ does $f_a(e_n)=a_n$ not have to converge strongly to zero as $n$ increases?","['real-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'weak-convergence', 'convergence-divergence']"

2022884,Probability: A flaw in logic? The emperor's proposition with marbles and two urns,"I've tried searching for this question but couldn't find it on stackexchange. This is a common type of interview question; I ran into it doing brain teasers on a probability puzzles app, and if you fine people agree with my logic, I will inform the app developer that his/her answers are incorrect. The problem is essentially this: You are sentenced to death for thievery. The King is magnanimous and decides to put your fate in the hands of chance. You are given $100$ white marbles and 100 black marbles, and $2$ urns. The king will choose an urn at random and pull out a single marble at random; if the marble is white, you live, if its black, you die. If you place the marbles in the best way possible, what is your probability of survival? I started with the base case: $100$ white marbles in one urn, $100$ black marbles in the other. This comes down to a $50$-$50$ chance of survival. I then worked my way to deciding that placing $1$ white marble in one urn and $99$ white marbles + $100$ black marbles in the other urn would be the ""best way possible"", which yields the following: $$P(\text{Survival}) = \frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{99}{199}) \approx .749$$ Selecting $1$ of $2$ urns at random gives $\frac{1}{2}$, the urn containing $1$ marble gives $1$, and the other that contains $99$ white marbles and $100$ black marbles gives $\frac{99}{199}$ because there are $99$ possible white marbles to select out of $199$ total marbles. The app claims that the correct answer is $\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{99}{200}) \approx .748$ I see where the $200$ comes from, but I do not think it is right to say that there are $200$ marbles in the other urn.

Show that $f$ is Lebesgue measurable if the region $$A=\{\ (x,y): x \in E, \  f(x) \geq y\}$$is a Lebesgue measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. My attempt on a solution : $f: E \to [0, +\infty)$ is Lebesgue measurable $\iff$ for any $y \geq 0$ we have $f^{-1} ( [y, +\infty) ) \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}) \cap E.$ Now notice that $ f^{-1} ( [y, +\infty) ) = \{ x \in E \ | \ f(x) \geq y \} = A^y$ - the $y$-section of the set $A$. We can apply Cavaliery's principle for complete measures (consequence of Fubini-Tonelli's theorem for complete measures): Since $A \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^2) = \overline{\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}) \otimes \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R})}$, we conclude that $A^y \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R})$ for almost any $y \in \mathbb{R}$ (or $y \in [0, + \infty)$ for that matter). This is close, but how to get rid of the ""almost any $y$"" part? Update : I finally found a slightly different approach which allows to take care of this nuisance (essentially that is what William hinted at in the comments): Define the set $F=A \cap ( E \times [0, +\infty) )=\{ (x,y) \ | \ x \in E, f(x) \geq y \geq 0 \} \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Take the indicator $\chi_F: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ which is therefore measurable. Applying Fubini-Tonelli's theorem for complete measures, we get that almost everywhere defined function $g(x) = \int \chi_{F}^{x} (y) d \lambda(y) = \lambda (\{y \in \mathbb{R} \ | \ f(x) \geq y \geq 0 \}  ) = f(x)$ is measurable. Going back to the proof of Fubini-Tonelli's thm for complete measures, we see that $g(x)$ can be extended to a measurable function (that is what people mean when they use the term ""almost everywhere defined""). Anyway, we get that $f(x)$ is almost everywhere equal to a measurable function, and since we are on a complete measure space, the result follows.","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"

2023185,What is this strange constellation of primes found in the plot of $ f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2^{n-1}} e^ {{2\pi i x \over {n}} } $?,"Let $$ f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2^{n-1}} e^ {{2\pi i x \over {n}} } $$ $f$ is therefore a complex-valued function of a real variable.
(An intuitive explanation at the very bottom of this question) On a Cartesian plane, I plot all points $(Re(f(x)), Im(f(x)))$ for real $x$ where $0 \leq x \leq 1000$: All values for the specified reals are first plotted in dark green. Values of $f(x)$ only for integer values of $x$ between $0$ and $1000$ are overlayed as grayscale dots of varying intensity (explained later on) on the green trajectory. Values of $f(x)$ only for prime values of $x$ between $0$ and $1000$ are overlayed as red dots on the green trajectory. A pattern emerges: all prime numbers distribute into $16$ evident clusters (or as I like to call them, constellations - fun to pretend that integers are stars on the night sky), with the exception of $2, 3$ and $5$, whose locations I've highlighted on the plot. Let us take a closer look at $f(x)$ values for the first $1000000$ integers: Same story: I first plot the integers in grayscale, and only later the primes in red. It looks like the integers form $60$ elliptical clusters, each of which could be divided into even more clusters. I thought it'd be good idea to give some specific intensity ($0-255$) to the pixel at $f(x)$, so I've tried calculating it as $255\over{x \mod{60}}$ - this is why some gray pixels are darker and some brighter. As you can see on the plots, pixels belonging to the same cluster have the same intensities, so perhaps such formula can be used to identify which cluster the value of $f(x)$ will belong to. Here is a closer look at one of the clusters (best viewed in 1:1): It looks like the aforementioned ""elliptical"" clusters divide into $42$ clusters, four of which intersect. These clusters divide into yet another $11$ circles... ...then let's see an even deeper zoom at one of these clusters: Each of the $11$ circles is made of circles again! Sadly, primes don't exhibit any order at this level of zoom. Questions: What is so special about primes that they gather in these sixteen constellations? Does this function tell us something interesting about primality? Could this function be slightly modified so that a more striking structure becomes apparent? Could this function be extended so that its values have a higher number of dimensions? For example, a one-dimensional version would be:
$$
f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}  {1 \over 2^{n-1}} cos( {{2\pi \over {n}} x} )$$ (whose plot unfortunately is not nearly as interesting) Intuitive explanation of $f(x)$: Imagine a stick of length equal to $1$. It makes a full rotation every one second: Imagine that another stick of length equal to $1\over{2^{1}}$ was attached to the above stick.

2023212,All binary strings of length n that do not contain 3 consecutive 0's,"I'm a bit stuck with this problem and I'm sorry if this sounds newbie, I havent had much practice with recurrence relations. My approach was to split the problem into two cases, we let $a_n$ denote all legal binary strings of length $n$ Appending $1$ to the front of a string, this case is simple because no illegal strings can be made by appending $1$ in front of a legal string, so by appending $1$ to all legal strings of length $n-1$ we get $a_{n-1}$ legal strings. Appending $0$ to the front of a string, this is where I get stuck. My idea was to split the second case into even further cases so that each case would deal with the following prefixes: $00$, $01$, $10$ and $11$ The problem is that I can not find any good way to determine how many of each prefix occurs in the set of legal strings of length $n-1$.

Can someone say something about the motivation for this definition, and how the analogy to the ring-theoretic case works?

Professor's solution: Assume for a contradiction that there exists  $\lim_{x \rightarrow0}(2x\sin(1/x)-\cos(1/x))=l$ for some $l\in\mathbb{R}.$ Notice that $\cos(1/x)=(\cos(1/x)-2x\sin(1/x))+2x\sin(1/x).$ Then by our assumption, the fact that $\lim_{x\rightarrow0}2x\sin(1/x)=0$ (proof by Sandwich Theorem omitted) and using the Algebra of Limits we have that $$\lim_{x\rightarrow0}(\cos(1/x)-2x\sin(1/x))+2x\sin(1/x)

2023382,Any employment for the Varignon parallelogram?,"The midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral form a parallelogram, which is called the Varignon parallelogram of the quad. While answering a question about Quadrilateral Interpolation it has been found
that the Varignon parallelogram may be considered as a Finite Difference five point star in disguise. Moreover it has been
derived that the associated Finite Element interpolation for an arbitrary function $T$ inside the parallelogram is linear :
$$
T(\xi,\eta) = T(0,0) + \frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi}(0,0).\xi
         + \frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta}(0,0).\eta
$$
with $-1 < \xi+\eta < +1$ and $-1 < \xi-\eta < +1$ and:
$$
T(0,0) = \frac{T_1+T_2}{2}=\frac{T_3+T_4}{2}\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi}(0,0) = \frac{T_2-T_1}{2}\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta}(0,0) = \frac{T_4-T_3}{2}
$$
The local parameters $(\xi,\eta)$ can be expressed in the global $(x,y)$ coordinates via:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} \xi \\ \eta \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} (x_2-x_1)/2 & (x_4-x_3)/2 \\ (y_2-y_1)/2 & (y_4-y_3)/2 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix} x-x(0,0) \\ y-y(0,0) \end{bmatrix} \\ \mbox{with} \quad
\begin{cases} x(0,0) = (x_1+x_2)/2=(x_3+x_4)/2\\y(0,0) = (y_1+y_2)/2=(y_3+y_4)/2\end{cases}
$$
It all seems like the Varignon parallelogram may be employable, for example as as a suitable Finite Element.
But I haven't seen yet any applications for it in printed mathematical literature. The applications I am
looking for are not required to be numerical in nature, though. I'm curious to see anything of practical use. Update. Talking about Finite Element applications, let us consider the (global) partial derivatives
of an arbitrary function $T$ at the parallelogram : $\partial T/\partial x\,$ and $\,\partial T/\partial y$ .
Like in the answer here it is advantageous to start the other way around:
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi} =
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi}
+\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} =
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta}
+\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta}
$$
The matrix formulation of this clearly shows that the inverse is what we need:
$$ \Large
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi} \\ \frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \\ \Large
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi} \\ \frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} & -\frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} \\
-\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} \end{bmatrix} / \Delta
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi} \\ \frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} \end{bmatrix}
$$ $$
\mbox{with} \quad \Delta = 
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} -
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi}
$$
The rest is easy, because:
$$
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} = \frac{x_2-x_1}{2}\quad ; \quad
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{2}\quad ; \quad
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \xi} = \frac{T_2-T_1}{2}\\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} = \frac{x_4-x_3}{2}\quad ; \quad
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} = \frac{y_4-y_3}{2}\quad ; \quad
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} = \frac{T_4-T_3}{2}
$$
But okay, for the sake of completeness:
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{(T_2-T_1)(y_4-y_3)-(T_4-T_3)(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)(y_4-y_3)-(x_4-x_3)(y_2-y_1)}\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} = \frac{(x_2-x_1)(T_4-T_3)-(x_4-x_3)(T_2-T_1)}{(x_2-x_1)(y_4-y_3)-(x_4-x_3)(y_2-y_1)}

2023842,Cylinder in 3D from five points?,"I have five points in 3D space which I want to use to form a cylinder in 3D.  I assume that these points are exactly on the cylinder. I know the equation for a cylinder is given by an origin and a normal to define the center axis of the cylinder, along with the cylinder's radius . The solution I came up with was to project the points onto a 2D plane via two unnormalized vectors $u_{ox}$ and $u_{oy}$ that are orthogonal to each other and to the normal , and then fitting the points to a circle equation. $(p_i \cdot u_{0x} - c_x)^2 + (p_i \cdot u_{0y} - c_y)^2 = r^2$ Depending on your choice of $u_{0x}$ and $u_{0y}$, when you expand the equations you get the solution (for paticular $a,b,...,h$) $x^2 + a \cdot x \cdot y + b \cdot x \cdot z + c \cdot x + d \cdot y^2 + e \cdot y \cdot z + f \cdot y + g \cdot z^2 + h = 0$ (Is this called a generic conic equation?) Now I know it would take nine sets of points $[x,y,z]=p_i$ to find the solution to the nine coefficients, but I have additional knowledge of the relationship between the coefficients. Going back to the original circle equation, you can choose some nice unnormalized vectors to develop your coefficients (provided the normal is not simply $+x$). $u_{0x}=\left[\begin{array}{c c c}
1 & -u_x \cdot u_y & u_x
\end{array}\right]$ $u_{0y}=\left[\begin{array}{c c c}
0 & s & u_y \cdot s
\end{array}\right]; 
s = \sqrt{\frac{1+u_x^2\cdot u_y^2+u_x^2}{1+u_y^2}}$ While $u_{ox}$ and $u_{oy}$ are orthogonal to each other, it requires a scaling factor $s$ or you'll end up with an ellipse instead of a circle when you do your projection. Between the circle equation and the equation for the unnormalized vectors, I've got five unknowns $(u_x, u_y, c_x, c_y, r)$ and the scaling factor $s$ (for which I have a gnarly equation).  That should mean that only five sets of points $p_i$ are necessary to find what these unknowns are.  But if you only work on the generic conic equation, you're short by four equations to find all of the unknowns. In terms of what all of those coefficients look like... $\begin{array}{r\;l}
p_x^2 & ( 1 ) \\
+ p_x \cdot py & ( -2 u_x \cdot u_y) \\
+ p_x \cdot pz & ( -2 u_x ) \\
+ p_x & ( -2 cx) \\

One reasonable approach seems to be using $\left(\cos^2x+\sin^2x\right)^3=1$ , since it contains the terms $\cos^6x$ and $\sin^6x$ . Another possibility would be replacing all occurrences of $\sin^2x$ by $1-\cos^2x$ on both sides and then comparing the results. Are there other solutions, simpler approaches? I found some other questions about the same expression, but they simplify this to another form: Finding $\sin^6 x+\cos^6 x$, what am I doing wrong here? , Alternative proof of $\cos^6{\theta}+\sin^6{\theta}=\frac{1}{8}(5+3\cos{4\theta})$ and Simplify $2(\sin^6x + \cos^6x) - 3(\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x) + 1$ . Perhaps also Prove that $\sin^{6}{\frac{\theta}{2}}+\cos^{6}{\frac{\theta}{2}}=\frac{1}{4}(1+3\cos^2\theta)$ can be considered similar.

2023977,Characterisation of surjectivity resembling one for injectivity,"For a function $f : A \to B$ we have the following equivalences: $f$ is injective, for all $X, Y \subseteq A$ we have $f(X \cap Y) = f(X) \cap f(Y)$, for all $X \subseteq Y \subseteq A$ we have $f(X \setminus Y) = f(X) \setminus f(Y)$. Does there exists a corresponding characterisation of surjectivity? For all other characterisations of those two properties I can find corresponding formulations, for example the following is equivalent to injectivity (with $(f\circ g)(x) := f(g(x))$): i) $|f^{-1}(\{b\})| \le 1$ for all $b \in B$, ii) there exists $g : B \to A$ such that $g \circ f = \mbox{id}_A$ iii) If $f \circ h = f \circ g$ then $h = g$. iv) for all $A \subseteq X$ we have $f^{-1}(f(A)) = A$. And those properties characterising surjectivity correspond to the above: i) $|f^{-1}(\{b\})| \ge 1$ for all $b \in B$, ii) there exists $g : B \to A$ such that $f \circ g = \mbox{id}_B$, iii) If $h \circ f = g \circ f$ then $h = g$, iv) for all $B \subseteq Y$ we have $f(f^{-1}(B)) = B$.

2024002,Cauchy sequence in universal algebra,"I finished working on algebraic cauchy sequences in june and have since then been having fun with universal algebra and generalizing algebraic structures and concepts and I had a thought today. So I am posting this as a question to see if it is valid and if there are any good sources to read up on it. In classical abstract algebra of rings, groups and modules we have the following definition, I will use group as it is in most cases based on it. For a given filtration $(G_n)$ of normal subgroups of $G$ such that $G_{n-1}\geq G_n$ we have that a sequence $(x_i)$ is cauchy if for a given $K$ that there exists an $N$ such that for $n,m\geq N$ we have that $x_nG_k=x_mG_k$. All dandy and fine for those categories but I was thinking if we expand it to be more general, universally so, what is needed? Obviously dealing with subgroups, ideals and such cannot be done, not all algebraic structures have those or something equivalent and even if they got something similar the differens in axioms and structure can still lend to anomolies appearing that makes it cumbersome to work with. So the obvious thing to go with is Congruence relatins then. So instead of a filtration of normal subgroups or the likes we would have this. For a given filtration $(\mathcal{R}_n)$ of congruence relations, $\mathcal{R}_n\in\text{Con}(A)$, such that $\mathcal{R}_n\subseteq\mathcal{R}_{n-1}$. That should take care of that issue as congruence relations are defined to respect the given structure we wouldn't need to worry about anything. And the subset part ensures it behaves like the other did. For the actual sequence part it'd still remain very similar and as $xN$ for a normal subgroup is just the equivalence class of $x \mod N$ we can go for equivalence classes such that it becomes A sequence $(x_i)\in A$ is cauchy if for a given $K$ there exists an $N$ such that for $n,m\geq N$ we have that $x_n/\mathcal{R}_K=x_m/\mathcal{R}_K$ Which should be a workable translation of those speical cases in the begining to a universal one that applies to any algebraic structure. With pointwise operations it would form another one of those structures as well as congruence relations makes it certain it will work. Edit - Addition:
For completion we have also this definition. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then a sequence $(x_i)$ is a null sequence if for every $K$ we have an $N$ such that $i>N$ means that $x_i\in G_k$. Mark this subgroup as $N$, then $\mathcal{C}/N$ is the completion of the group with respect to the filtration. I thought further ahead on that issue and I attempt to translate it into this statement. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then two sequences $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$ are in the relation $\mathcal{R}$ if for a given $K$ we have there exists an $N$ such that for $i>N$ that $x_i/\mathcal{R}_K =y_i/\mathcal{R}_K$. Then the completion is then $\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{R}$. This is clearly a congruence relation and as such the quotient is meaningful and works. Is this a proper translation of the definition to the language of universal algebra? Are there any possible sources that have worked on it?","['reference-request', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'universal-algebra']"

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{x+ \sqrt{1-x^2}} = \frac \pi 4.

Then I thought about whether I could make it simpler by avoiding trigonometric substitutions, like this:
$$
y = \sqrt{1-x^2}
$$
Therefore
$$
y^2+x^2=1 \tag a
$$
From the symmetry in line $(\text{a})$ we get
$$
\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{x+y} = \int_0^1 \frac{dy}{x+y}.
$$
Now let's do something stupid, claiming that the sum of these two integrals is
$$
\int_0^1 \frac{dx + dy}{x+y}.
$$
This is stupid because the expression $\displaystyle\int_0^1$ means some particular variable is going from $0$ to $1$, and surely that is not $x+y$. To write such an expression is either to hope the gullible reader won't notice the problem, or else to be the confused student who doesn't notice it. If we want to continue being stupid, we could go on to write this last integral as
$$
\int_0^1 \frac{du} u,
