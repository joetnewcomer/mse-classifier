242114,Proof that a Zariski closed subset of a projective space is the common zeros of homogeneous polynomials,"Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field.
Let $n \ge 0$ be an integer.
We consider $K^{n+1}$ as a topological space with Zariski topology.
Let $G = K^*$ be the multiplicative group of $K$.
Let $X = K^{n+1} - {0}$.
Then $G$ acts on $X$.
Then the projective space $P^n$ over $K$ is, by definition, the orbit space $X/G$.
We regard $P^n$ as a topological space with the quotient topology.
Let $Z$ be a closed subset of $P^n$.
Then how do you prove that $Z$ is the common zeros of homogeneous polynomials?",['algebraic-geometry']
242123,About a possible Hardy-type inequality for negative exponents,"In virtue of this result: Prove that $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2k+1}{a_1+a_2+...+a_k}<4\sum_{k=1}^n\frac1{a_k}.$ it is possible to state that, if 
$$\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{a_n}$$
is a converging series with positive terms,
$$\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\frac{n}{a_1+\ldots+a_n}<2\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{a_n},$$
and this is exactly the statement of the Hardy's inequality for $p=-1$. (1) Is the constant $2$ in the RHS the best possible constant? (2) Does the integral analogue holds? I.e., is it true that, if $f$ is a positive function belonging to $L^1(\mathbb{R}^+)$,
$$\int_{0}^{+\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{dy}{f(y)}\right)^{-1}\,dx<2\int_{0}^{+\infty}f(x)\,dx\;?$$ (3) Does the Hardy-type inequality with negative exponent
$$\int_{0}^{+\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{dy}{f(y)^p}\right)^{-1/p}\,dx< C_p \int_{0}^{+\infty}f(x)\,dx\;?$$

But does it at least have the property that away from the main diagonal, the difference decreases?  That is, do we have $|a_1-a_0|\geq|a_2-a_1|\geq\dots\geq|a_n-a_{n-1}|$? After some experimenting, it seems like we might be able to expect this, but I am wondering if this is known already as I know very little about Toeplitz forms?  A followup question I have is if this is true, then is it ""easy"" to see that it should remain true for bi-infinite Toeplitz matrices of the same form? The actual matrix I am interested in, for what it's worth, is $A_\lambda = (e^{-\lambda|j-k|^2})_{j,k\in\mathbb{Z}}$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'toeplitz-matrices', 'operator-theory']"
242234,Values of cyclotomic polynomial and properties of groups,"There are restrictions on the values of a cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at an integer that are reminiscent of the restrictions on the number of Sylow groups of a group. So I'd like to know if there is a connection. Does the value of a cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at an integer count something related to the properties of a certain group (for example, something related to its Sylow groups)? For example, if $n_p$ is the number of $p$-Sylow groups of the group $G$ with $|G|=n=p^\alpha r$, then $n_p\equiv 1 \pmod p$. On the other hand, if $p | \Phi_n(x)$ and $p \not| n$, then $p\equiv 1 \pmod n$. Since the cyclotomic polynomial are closely related to the cyclic groups, their values might count something about the group.","['cyclotomic-polynomials', 'group-theory']"

While isomorphisms seem to be very natural to think about, I can't visualize what's happening in homomorphisms. At this time, I only have a sketchy idea that the existence of a homomorphism between groups (or between groups and what they're acting on) means that they both somehow combine the same way..

242360,Irreducible fibers of a closed subset implies irreducibility,"Let $f:X \to Y$ be a morphism of varieties and let $Z \subset X$ be a closed subset. Assume that $f^{-1}(p) \cap Z$ is irreducible and of the same dimension for all $p \in Y.$ Show that $Z$ is irreducible. Here is what I tried: Assume the contrary and let $Z=Z_1 \cup Z_2$ where $Z_i$s are closed in $Z.$ By assumption, $f^{-1}(p) \cap Z=(f^{-1}(p) \cap Z_1) \cup (f^{-1}(p) \cap Z_2)$ is irreducible, so let $U=\{p \in Y|\; f^{-1}(p) \cap Z=f^{-1}(p) \cap Z_1 \}$ and $V=\{p \in Y|\; f^{-1}(p) \cap Z=f^{-1}(p) \cap Z_2 \}.$ My strategy is to prove that $U,V$ are closed in $Y$ and get the contradiction ( $Y$ is a variety, so irreducible). For instance, consider $U \subset Y.$ Then $Y$ has a finite open affine cover by $Y_i$s, so is enough to show that $U \cap Y_i$ is closed in $Y_i$ for all $i.$ I also know that there is an open subset in $W \subset Y$ s.t. all fibers $f^{-1}(x)$ have the same dimension for all $x \in W,$ but I got stuck and donât know how to proceed and use the fact that $f^{-1}(p) \cap Z$ have the same dimension for all $p \in Y.$",['algebraic-geometry']

242382,How to prove this $\sigma$-algebra can't be countably generated?,"This set$$\{E\subset(0,1]:E\text{ is countable or } E^c\text{ is countalbe}\}$$is a $\sigma$-algebra.I strongly believe it can't be generated by some countable collection of sets. But I don't know how to prove it rigorously. Thanks! By Nate Eldredge's hints, I write the details here: For hint 1: for the each set $A_i\in \mathcal{A}$ with $A_i^c$ is countable, we can replace $A_i$ by $A_i^c$. For the new set $\mathcal A'$, we have $\sigma(\mathcal A)=\sigma(\mathcal A')$. So ""without loss of generality, we can assume all the $A_i$   are countable."" For hint 2: Because every $A_i\in \mathcal{A}$ is countable, so $\mathcal A$ can only cover countable many point in $(0,1]$. There must be some point $x\in (0,1]$, and $x\notin A_i,i=1,2,...$. Let $B=\{x\}$. For hint 3: Let $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$, and
$$\mathcal F=\{E\subset(0,1]:E\subset A\text{ or }E^c\subset A\}$$
We can easily check $\mathcal F$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, and $\mathcal A\subset\mathcal F$. Hence $\sigma(\mathcal A)\subset\mathcal F$ but $B=\{x\}\notin\mathcal F$.",['measure-theory']

Must there exist a point $p \in (0,\infty)$ such that for all $x \in (0,p)$ we have  $f'(x) > 0$? This is not a book or homework problem, this is a a question of my own. 
So far I have tried a contradiction, assume that for all $p \in (0, \infty)$ there is at least one $x \in(0,p)$ such that $f'(x) \leq 0$. Consider such a point $x$, now, by Darboux's Theorem there should be a point $x_0 \in (0,x)$ such that $f'(x_0) = 0$. Let $p = x_0$, there must be another point $x$ such that $f'(x) \leq 0$ , and hence, another point $x_1$ such that $f'(x_1) = 0$ (it is of course trivial that $x_1 < x_0$). As this process keeps repeating, there should be a infinite sequence of points $x_0,x_1,x_2,...$ converging to $0$ (the sequence is bounded below by $0$ by definition so the Monotone Convergence Theorem should guarantee convergence to $0$ right?) such that $f'=0$ at any point in this sequence.

242487,What's the payoff associated with the definition of a relation as an ordered triple?,"We can define a binary relation as a set of ordered pairs. Alternatively, we can call the set of ordered pairs the ""graph"" of the relation, and define the relation itself as a triple $(X,Y,f)$, where $f$ is the graph, $X$ is its domain and $Y$ is its codomain. The same goes for functions; they can be defined as sets of ordered pairs, or as triples. So my question is, given that its more lightweight to define a binary relation simply as its graph, why is the ordered-triple approach much more common? Here's a list of reasons and possible objections that I've come up with. Reason 0: The ordered-triple approach allows us to distinguish between surjections and non-surjections. Possible Objection: This could be read another way, as suggesting that surjectivity is a contrived concept. Maybe we should only every say ""$f \in \mathrm{Surj}(X,Y)$"" but never simply say ""$f$ is a surjection."" Reason 1: Category theory works that way. Possible Objection: Perhaps this is a ""hint"" that maybe there's room for improvement in the basic definitions of category theory. Reason 2: The ordered triple approach allows us to define the complement of a relation by $f^c = X \times Y \setminus f$. Thus, the set of all relations with domain $X$ and codomain $Y$ form a Boolean algebra. Possible Objection: This is a pretty minor advantage, given that we can just write ""Defining $A^c = X\times Y \setminus A$, it follows that..."" whenever we need to. So my question is, what's the payoff of the ordered triple approach?","['relations', 'functions', 'definition']"

242695,Pythagorean theorem in unitary vector spaces,"In euclidean (i.e. real) vector spaces the pythagorean theorem holds, i.e.
$$
 ||x+y||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 \Leftrightarrow x \perp y.

$$
 \langle x , y \rangle + \langle y, x \rangle =  \langle x , y \rangle + \overline{\langle x, y \rangle} = 2\operatorname{Re}(x,y).

And I have a counterexample, let $X = \mathbb{C}$ be the 1-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space. Consider $x = 1$ and $y = i$. Then $2\operatorname{Re}(x,y) = 0$ but it is not the case that $x \perp y$. But here is my question, sure it is the case that $i$ is perpedicular to $1$, so why it is said that its not? Or is there another notion of perpendicularity in a unitary vector space, one that is not as intuitive? Another example is $1+i$ and $1-i$, when I draw them they are of course perpendicular, but

242699,Arzela-Ascoli: why is boundedness required?,"One of the ways the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem is stated is as follows: Given a compact space $X$ and a set $ M \subset C(X) := \{f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \| . \|_{\infty}\}$, the following are equivalent: 1) $M$ is bounded, closed and uniformly equicontinuous. 2) $M$ compact. Why is the condition on boundedness required, and does it not follow from uniform equicontinuity? It appears to me that uniform equicontinuity implies (pointwise) continuity of any function $f$ in $M$, and since $X$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, $f(X)$ is compact so $f$ takes its maximum and minimum on its image. In particular, it would follow that $\| f\|_{\infty} < \infty$, for every $f \in M$, so $M$ is bounded. Since the theorem is well-established, it seems to me that there must be some mistake in this argument.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

242744,"The ""degree"" of the Fano scheme of a projective variety vs. the degree of its ""image"" in projective space.","Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety. The Fano scheme $F_1(X)$ of lines $L\in\mathbb{P}^n$ contained in $X$ is a subscheme of the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(1,n)$. We can find the class $[F_1(X)]$ in the Chow ring of the Grassmannian. Furthermore, we can write this class uniquely as a sum of the Schubert cycles $\sigma_{a,b}\in A^{a+b}(\mathbb{G}(1,n))$. On the other hand, we can also look at the space $|F_1(X)|\subseteq X$, consisting of the union of all lines $L\in F_1(X),$ presumably with an appropriate reduced structure corresponding to lines appearing with multiplicity. We can write the class $[|F_1(X)|]$ in the Chow ring of $\mathbb{P}^n$ uniquely as a sum of planes of various dimensions. My question is, what is the relationship between these two expressions? Here is an example. On a quadric surface $Q\subseteq\mathbb{P}^3$, the class $[F_1(X)]$ is (if I calculated it correctly) $4\sigma_{2,1}$, i.e. four times the class of lines in a plane $H$ containing a point $p\in H.$ Now it is apparently true (quadric surfaces are just the SegrÃ© surface up to change of coordinates, no?) that generically, each point of $Q$ is contained in two lines in $Q$. In other words, $|F_1(X)|$ is ""two copies of $Q$"", a subscheme of degree 4 in codimension 1 in $\mathbb{P}^3$. It seems like perhaps not a coincidence, then, that $[F_1(X)]$ is ""degree 4 in codimension 1,"" whatever that should mean. Is there a natural notion of ""degree"" in the Chow groups of the Grassmannian, that is preserved by this map to the Chow groups of projective space? In particular, if I calculated everything correctly, the class of lines on a general quartic surface in $\mathbb{P}^4$ is $544\sigma_{3,2}.$ Does anyone happen to know if it's true that through each point there are 544/4=136 lines?",['algebraic-geometry']

242824,"Given a set of digits, what is the biggest number we can make using exponentiation - numberphile noodle quiz","The question is motivated by a question on a can of number noodles. Each item is a digit between $0$ and $9$ . Clearly, if you form a string and consider it to represent a base $10$ integer, then you'll get the biggest number if you start with the high digits $999...$ and end with the zeros $...1111000000000$ . In this youtube video, username numberphile (who does enthusiastic number theory videos for the layman) presents the digis of his can and brings forward the following generalized question: Given a set of digits from my noodle can, what's the biggest number you can make using only (a) addition, (b) multiplication and (c) exponentiation? So here my thoughts: Generally, I'm given a multiset of digits and I can use up any of these together two form numbers greater than $9$ . And each of the three operations is binary, i.e. $(a,b)\mapsto a+b,\ \ \ \ \ \ $ $(a,b)\mapsto a\cdot b,\ \ \ \ \ \ $ $(a,b)\mapsto a^b,$ and only the last one isn't commutative and associative. The question seems to imply we can use bracketing as we like, so I won't bother about these. I can decide the first two tasks simply by checking if the concatenation of digits is better than binary operation for accieving big numbers: Given $n+1$ digits $(d_0,d_1,d_2,...,d_n)$ , their concatenation $\text{con}:(d_n,d_{n-1},d_{n-2},\dots,d_1,d_0) \mapsto \sum_{k=0}^n d_k 10^k$ gives us summands involving higher and higher powers of $10$ . Since for $d_{n}\ne 0$ we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k 10^k < 10^{n+1},$ we find $d_{n+1}\cdot\text{con}(d_n,\dots) =d_{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k 10^k < d_{n+1}10^{n+1} < \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} d_k 10^k = \text{con}(d_{n+1},d_n,\dots).$ i.e. $\text{con}$ is stronger than multiplication for any free digit. However, checking some pairs of digits for the third operation $$2^3<3^2<23<32,$$ $$34<43<4^3<3^4$$ or $$5^2=25<2^5<52$$ I can see no obvious pattern! The algorithm to construct the biggest number will depend on the values of the symbols. So my first question is this (the question in the video): (c) Using concatenation and exponentiation, what is the biggest number you can make? How can you show that it is really is the maximum? I guess that proof should be done in general, but here are the specific digits of the problem: I'm just going to assume no available computer will be able to compute that absurd power, but I'd be interested in some of its characteristics nevertheless. Further thoughts: Now if there are $N$ digits in total, which are free to use in concatenation, you can use number sets of up to size $N$ for the binary operaton. E.g. If there were only three digits $\{0,3,7\}$ , the number sets of size $N=2$ would be $\{\{0,37\},  \{0,73\},\{3,70\},\{7,30\}\}$ .
Side note: There is an obvious additional rule regarding zero, namely that you can't have strings starting with $0$ . For each number $N$ , there are a fixed number of possible bracketings, like e.g. $(a,((b,c),d))$ , which determine the result, $a^{(b^c)^d}$ here. I guess the bracketing is a simple (downwards) tree graph where each node has eighter none or two (downwards) offspings. One should be able to count these. The amount of of different numbers for the binary operation (exponentiation is of primary interest here) one can generate is limited by the quantity of number sets you can build using concatenation of digits and the number of braketings for each set size. How many different filled bracket structures can you have? Notice that for the noncommutative exponentiation, the two number sets $\{a,b\}$ have to be replaces by pairs $\{(a,b),(b,a)\}$ because $a^b\ne b^a$ . And much more difficult: Taking into account that different such structures can end up in the same number: What is the quantity of different results you can have? Is there a workable method of working out the ""kernel"" of this construction? Lastly (minor priority): As we deal with high number of digits here, the majority of results have relatively low Kolmogorov complexity. Given a certain operaton (e.g. exponentiation), the biggest number we can generate and the number of results we can have, can we conclude a pattern regarding the gap size between different biggest numbers as a function of the numbers of digits we use as input?","['puzzle', 'elementary-number-theory', 'arithmetic', 'big-numbers', 'combinatorics']"

243164,Why is the tensor product of two pseudoreal representations real?,"Let G be a group, and $\rho : G \to GL(n, \mathbb{C})$ be a representation of $G$.  Then we also get the conjugate representation $\rho^* : G \to GL(n, \mathbb{C})$, where $\rho^*(g) = \overline{\rho(g)}$. This definition is naÃ¯ve, but it will suffice here. We say that $\rho$ is a real representation if there exists some $M \in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ such that $M\rho(g)M^{-1} \in GL(n,\mathbb{R}) ~\forall~ g \in G$.  If $\rho$ is not real, but still $\rho \cong \rho^*$, we say that $\rho$ is pseudoreal . I believe it is a fact (though I don't have a reference) that the tensor product of two pseudoreal representations is real, but I've never quite understood why.  Is there an elementary proof, and/or an easy way to understand this? Simple examples: The fundamental representation $\mathbf{2}$ of $SU(2)$ is pseudoreal, but $\mathbf{2}\otimes\mathbf{2} = \mathbf{3}\oplus\mathbf{1}$ is real (the $\mathbf{3}$ is the fundamental rep. of $SO(3)$, lifted to $SU(2) \cong \text{Spin}(3)$).  Similarly, if we consider $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, then $(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{2}) = (\mathbf{2},\mathbf{1})\otimes(\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2})$ is real, being the lift to $SU(2)\times SU(2) \cong \text{Spin}(4)$ of the fundamental rep. of $SO(4)$.","['representation-theory', 'group-theory']"

Let $(x_n)$ be a convergent sequence in $A$. $A$ is closed $\implies (x_n) \to p \in A$. As every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $A$ that converges to $p \in A$ and hence $A$ is complete. That sound ok?
