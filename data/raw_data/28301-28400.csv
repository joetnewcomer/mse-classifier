262928,Weak convergence in $L^p$ and uniform convergence,"I don't understand the last line of a proof (which is supposed to be obvious...), could you help me? The context is the following. We have a bounded open set $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$, and a $C^\infty$-mapping $$F : \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R} \times U \to \mathbb{R}^m$$ We also have a sequence $(u_n)_n$ of $W^{1,p}(U)$ ($p > 1$) and $u \in W^{1,p}(U)$ such that $u_n$ converges uniformly to $u$ and $\nabla u_n$ converges weakly in $L^p(U,\mathbb{R}^m)$ to $\nabla u$. Last, we know that $|u| + |\nabla u| < M$ for some $M < +\infty$. The first thing said is that $F(\nabla u, u_n, .)$ converges uniformly to $F(\nabla u, u, .)$ on $U$. I have the intuition that it's true but I don't know how to prove it formally. Is it just obvious from some sort of theorem about function composition? I suppose I have to use the condition $|u| + |\nabla u| < M$ somewhere... Secondly, $$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_U F(\nabla u(x), u_n(x),x)\cdot (\nabla u_n(x) - \nabla u(x)) dx = 0$$(We know that the definite integral exists and is finite for each $n$). They said that ""weak convergence is, by its very definition, compatible with linear expressions, and so the limit holds"", but I don't understand this statement... Thank you in advance if you can explain me one of the two affirmations (and sorry for my not perfect english) :). I perhaps have forgotten some hypothesis (even if I hope not), so don't hesitate if you think there is something missing or unclear.",['functional-analysis']

262935,"Convergence of indicator functions in $L^2[0,1]$ when $m(\limsup(E_n)\setminus \liminf(E_n)) = 0$","I am trying to solve a qualifying exam problem. I would like to know what can be said about the convergence of the indicator functions $I_{E_k}$ in $L^2[0, 1]$ when it's known that $m(\limsup E_k\setminus\liminf E_k) = 0$. My guess is that at least $I_{E_k}$ converges in $L^2$, and it seems like one way to show it is to show that $I_{E_k}$ is Cauchy, using the definitions of the lim sup and lim inf of a sequence of sets, but this is where I'm stuck. Any hints would be appreciated! Edit: Basically I'd like to make this rigorous: $$\|I_{E_k} - I_{E_l}\|^2_2 = m(E_k \Delta E_l) = m((E_k \cup E_l) \setminus (E_k \cap E_l)).$$ For $l > k$ and as $k\rightarrow\infty$, $$
\begin{align*}
0 &\leq m((E_k \cup E_l) \setminus (E_k \cap E_l)) = \lim\sup_k \int I_{(E_k \cup E_l) \setminus (E_k \cap E_l)}dm \\
&\leq \int \lim\sup_k I_{(E_k \cup E_l) \setminus (E_k \cap E_l)}dm \leq \int I_{(\lim\sup E_n \setminus \lim\sup E_n)}dm  \\
&= m(\lim\sup E_n \setminus \lim\inf E_n) = 0,

262946,Uniqueness for 3-dimensional heat equation initial Robin boundary value problem (SOLVED),"Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a bounded domain. Using an energy argument, show that the IBVP
\begin{align}
u_t &= \Delta u ~~~~~~~~~~x \in \Omega, ~t>0\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} + \alpha u &= h(x) ~~~~~~~~x \in \partial\Omega, ~t>0\\
u(x,0)&=g(x) ~~~~~~~~~x \in \Omega
\end{align}
where $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal and $\alpha$ is a constant has at most one solution. Treat the cases $\alpha \geq 0$ and $\alpha<0$ separately. Use logarithmic convexity for the second case. My attempted solution: By contradiction, suppose that there are two solutions $u_1$ and $u_2$ and define $v = u_1 - u_2$. Then $v$ satisfies 
\begin{align}
v_t &= \Delta v ~~~~~~~~~~x \in \Omega, ~t>0\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} + \alpha v &= 0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~x \in \partial\Omega, ~t>0\\
v(x,0)&=0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~x \in \Omega
\end{align}
Define the energy functional to be
$$E(t)= \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega v^2 \,dx.$$ 
The case $\alpha \geq 0$ is trivial. I just showed that 
$$\frac{dE}{dt}=\int_\Omega v \, v_t \,dx \leq 0$$ 
using Green's first identity and the conditions on $v$. Then since $E(0)=0$ we must have $E(t)=0$, and hence $v=0$. For the $\alpha<0$ case I want to show that 
$$E\frac{d^2E}{d^2t} - \left( \frac{dE}{dt} \right)^2 \geq 0\,.$$
Since $E \geq 0$ then by logarithmic convexity we would have $E=0$. However, I'm running into some problems. I take
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2E}{dt^2}=\int_\Omega v_t^2 \,dx + \int_\Omega v \, v_{tt} \,dx\,.
\end{align}
Then, for the second term I write
\begin{align}
\int_\Omega v \, v_{tt} \,dx &=\int_\Omega v \, \Delta v_t \, dx\\
&= \int_\Omega v_t \, \Delta v \, dx \\
&= \int_\Omega (v_t)^2 \, dx
\end{align} where I used Green's second identity and the boundary term vanished due to the boundary condition on $v$. Explicitly: \begin{align}
\int_{\partial \Omega} v\frac{\partial v_t}{\partial \nu} - v_t \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} dS= \alpha \int_{\partial \Omega} -v v_t + v_t v \, dS = 0
\end{align}
by the homogeneous Robin condition. So I get 
$$E\frac{d^2E}{d^2t} - \left( \frac{dE}{dt} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega v^2 dx \cdot 2 \int_\Omega v_t^2 dx - \left( \int_\Omega v v_t \, dx \right)^2 \geq 0$$
by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. So I did the proof without even using the assumption $\alpha < 0$, which seems very strange. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

262984,Proof of differentiability,"A function $f$ is defined in $R$, and $f'(0)$ exist. Let $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ then prove that $f'$ exists for all $x$ in $R$. I find this problem in here, 
and wonder the proof stated below has any problems? Since $f'(0)=\lim_{h \rightarrow  0} \frac{f(0)(f(h)-1)}{h}=f(0)\lim_{h \rightarrow  0} \frac{f(h)-1}{h}$ it means $\lim_{h \rightarrow  0} \frac{f(h)-1}{h}$ exists. $f'(x)==\lim_{h \rightarrow  0} \frac{f(x)(f(h)-1)}{h}=f(x)\lim_{h \rightarrow  0} \frac{f(h)-1}{h}$ thus $f'(x)$ exists if $f(x)$ exists. But we can differentiate a function if it has a function value $f(x)$, thus  $f'$ exists for all $x$ in $R$. I know it's not a perfect one, just want to know it can be another way to solve that problem or not. ================================================================ $f(0)=0$ case: If $f(0)=0$, because $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$, $f(x)=f(x+0)=f(x)f(0)=0$ thus $f'(x)=f'(0)$.

Prove that $\displaystyle Pr[X=0] \leq \frac{Var[X]}{E[X^2]}$ In particular, they prove in the chapter that this is true by replacing $E[X^2]$ with $E[X]^2$ by using a simple application of Chebyshev's inequality (they set $\lambda$ in the theorem to $E[X]/Var[X]$).

263018,Directional derivative of vector field,"I am trying to compute the directional derivative of a vector field $V$ along a direction $U$. Actually, my vector field is initially only defined on a curve $\gamma(t)$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, and I smoothly extend it on a tubular neighborhood of the curve in the following way : for each point in the neighborhood of $\gamma(t)$, I project it on $\gamma$ using any metric $h(u,v)$ and take the value of the vector field at that point : $V(t)$. The extension can be arbitrary for my purpose, so, $h(u,v)$ can be any Riemannian metric, not necessarily the same as $g$. What I thus need to compute, to get the directional derivative, is :
$$ U V = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{ V(\gamma^{-1}(\Pi (\gamma(t) + \epsilon U))) - V(t)}{\epsilon}$$
where $\Pi$ is the projection operator on the curve $\gamma$ and $V(t)$ is the vector field initially defined on $\gamma(t)$. I locally use a second order Taylor expansion of $\gamma(t+\delta) \approx \gamma(t) + \delta\dot\gamma(t) + \frac{\delta^2}{2}\ddot\gamma(t)$ I first compute the projection: 
$$\gamma^{-1}(\Pi (\gamma(t) + \epsilon U)) = argmin_\delta \|\gamma(t+\delta) - (\gamma(t)+\epsilon U)\|_h^2$$
where I take the norm out of my arbitrary metric $h$. So, cancelling out the derivative over $\delta$ :
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \delta} \|\gamma(t+\delta) - (\gamma(t)+\epsilon U)\|_h^2 = 0$$
$$\Rightarrow 2\,h(\dot\gamma+\delta\ddot\gamma, \delta\dot\gamma + \delta^2\ddot\gamma-\epsilon U) = 0$$
Keeping only the first order terms :
$$ \Rightarrow \delta = \epsilon \frac{h(\dot\gamma, U)}{h(\dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)} = \gamma^{-1}(\Pi (\gamma(t) + \epsilon U))-t$$ Coming back to the original problem :
$$ U V = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{ V(t + \epsilon \frac{h(\dot\gamma, U)}{h( \dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)}) - V(t)}{\epsilon}$$
$$ \Rightarrow U V = \frac{h(\dot\gamma, U)}{h(\dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)} \dot V$$ In particular, when $V=\dot\gamma$, I get $U V = \frac{h(\dot\gamma, U)}{h(\dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)} \ddot\gamma$ Now, what worries me is that I want to compute the Lie bracket $[UV]=UV-VU$. Since I took $h$ to be a (symmetric) Riemannian metric, I necessarily get $[UV]=0$ for any curve, any metric, any extension... I guess that would be a wonderful theorem. But could you spot the bug ? Is it because I didn't use enough terms in the Taylor expansion (or because I truncated the second order terms when computing the result of the projection) ? Thanks!! [[EDIT: Arrrg, I realize that $[UV] \neq 0$ since $[UV]=\frac{h(\dot\gamma, U)}{h(\dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)} \dot V - \frac{h(\dot\gamma, V)}{h(\dot\gamma, \dot\gamma)} \dot U$ !!

263029,How does one determine which variables to do induction on?,"I have been struggling with this all day.  When one does mathematical induction, how does one choose when to induct with one variable, or with more than one? I have been working through Tao's Analysis I and got up to Lemma 2.2.3 . At this point, addition of natural numbers is only defined as follows: Let $n,m \in \mathbb N$.  Then $0+m:=m$, and $(n^{++})+m:=(n+m)^{++}$ (""$:=$"" means ""defined as"", and ""${}^{++}$"" stands for ""increment of"".  At this point in the text basically only Peano's Axioms are defined.  Commutativity of addition has not been defined yet.) Lemma 2.2.3 states: if $n,m\in \mathbb N$, then $n+(m^{++})=(n+m)^{++}$ I was able to prove it in the way that was shown in the text, but what puzzled me was the method of induction.  In the text, Tao decides to induct on $n$ while leaving $m$ constant, which was great.
However, after he finishes this induction, he says that the lemma is proven.  I assumed that afterwards he would have to somehow induct on $m$ (two-dimensional induction), but seemingly this isn't needed.  Why is this? edit: Here is the proof: Proof: Induct on $n$ (keeping $m$ fixed). Consider the base case: $0+(m^{++})=(0+m)^{++}$.  Applying the Def'n of Addition to each side implies that $m^{++}=m^{++}$, which is true. Suppose inductively that $n+(m^{++})=(n+m)^{++}$. We have to prove the inductive step, namely that $(n^{++})+(m^{++})=((n^{++})+m)^{++}$. Using the Def'n of Addition on both sides gives $(n+(m^{++}))^{++}=((n+m)^{++})^{++}$. Using the supposition on the left side gives $((n+m)^{++})^{++}=((n+m)^{++})^{++}$, which is true.
  Thus, whenever $P(n)$ is true, $P(n^{++})$ is true.  With the base case established, this proves Lemma 2.2.3 . edit2: I found this blog post with a good example
of 2D induction.  It seems in this example, 2D induction is needed only because there are two separate cases:
one for $f(m+1,n)$ and another for $f(m,n+1)$.  I'm currently searching for (and trying to understand) other examples.","['induction', 'real-analysis']"

263131,"Is there a Steiner system S(6,9,45)?","Background: the Belgian Lottery switched its main game this year to a draw of 6 balls out of a pool of 45, plus a bonus number which doesn't matter for the sake of this question. Assuming someone would like to play all combinations, this means filling out $\binom{45}{6}$, or 8145060 grids, which would be a logistical nightmare and hasn't, as far as I know, attempted since 1990 (and that was with 1947792 grids). However, the Belgian lottery also offers ""multiple"" betslips, in which one picks 7 to 15 numbers, so that all combination of 6 numbers out of these are played, allowing one to play up to 5005 combinations with a single betslip. At first glance, this would seem to be a solution to the logistical issues, but to ensure each combination is played only once, there should be no overlap; that is, a combination of 6 numbers is present only on one betslip. This would be possible using multiple betslips filled with n numbers if there exists a Steiner system S(6,n,45). Obviously S(6,15,45) doesn't exist, as $\binom{45}{6}/\binom{15}{6}$, which would be the number of blocks (or betslips filled) isn't an integer. Similarly, we can show that S(6,14,45) and S(6,13,45) don't exist either. Another property of Steiner systems is that the existence of S(t−1,k−1,n−1) is a necessary condition for the existence of S(t,k,n). With this property, we can also eliminate S(6,12,45) since S(5,11,44) doesn't exist as $\binom{44}{5}/\binom{11}{5}$ is not an integer. Similarly, we can rule out S(6,11,45), S(6,10,45), S(6,8,45) and (6,7,45). However, S(6,9,45) can't be eliminated that way, as all subsystems do have an integer number of blocks. S(6,9,45) would have 96965 blocks (thus betslips), S(5,8,44) would have 19393, S(4,7,43) 3526, S(3,6,42) 574, and the known S(2,5,41) has 82 . And indeed, S(6,9,45) is listed as a possible Steiner system . So my question is, does the Steiner system S(6,9,45) actually exist? The wikipedia page states that ""As of 2012, an outstanding problem in design theory is if any nontrivial (t < k < n) Steiner systems have t ≥ 6"", so I assume proving that S(6,9,45) exists would be a major breakthrough. I'm not naive enough to expect that, but on the other hand, maybe it doesn't exist; and if that's the case, can it be proven? Disclaimer: I do currently work for the Belgian Lottery, and while I ask this question out of personal interest, I may show answers to colleagues. On the other hand, considering we don't currently offer jackpots which would make interesting for anyone to attempt this, I'm confident the question is purely theoretical anyway.",['combinatorics']

263189,Proof that a function with a countable set of discontinuities is Riemann integrable without the notion of measure,"Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function and $A$ be the set of its discontinuities. I am asking for a (direct) proof that if $A$ is countable then $f$ is Riemann integrable in $[a,b]$ that doesn't explicitely, or implicitly, require the notion of sets of measure $0$ ( and of course without the use of the Lebesgue Criterion). One could take a typical proof of the Lebesgue Criterion, make the neccessary adjustments and give me the proof of what I am asking. I don't want that however, but rather a simpler and more direct proof that heavily relies on the fact that $A$ is countable. A proof that can't be trivially altered so that it holds even if $\lambda(A)=0$ EDIT: Here is the proof of WimC with all the details:
Let $\epsilon>0$ and $$D=\left\{d_1,d_2,...\right\}\subseteq A$$ be the countable set of discontinuities of $f$. Define:
$$I=\left\{x\in [a,b]:\exists \delta>0: \omega f((x-\delta,x+\delta)\cap [a,b])<\epsilon\right\}$$
Now 
$$x\in I\iff \exists \delta>0: \omega f((x-\delta,x+\delta)\cap [a,b])<\epsilon\iff [\left|y-x\right|<\delta\implies \omega f(y)<\epsilon]$$
and because $\epsilon$ is in fact arbitrary,
$$x\in I\iff \text{ $f$ is continuous at $x$}$$
In addition, if $x\in I$, $\exists \delta>0$ so that
$$\omega f((x-\delta,x+\delta)\cap [a,b])<\epsilon$$
If $y\in B(x,\delta)\cap [a,b]$. Then $y\in I$ and so $I$ is open relative to $[a,b]$. Because $I=[a,b]\setminus D$, $[a,b]=I\cup D$. For $k\in \mathbb{N}$ define
$$D_k=\left(d_k-\frac{\epsilon}{M2^{k+1}},d_k+\frac{\epsilon}{M2^{k+1}}\right)\cap [a,b]$$
Obviously $D\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}D_k$ and $[a,b]=I\cup  \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}D_k$ (since $D_k\subseteq [a,b]$). The compactness of $[a,b]$ implies $[a,b]=I\cup  \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}D_k$. 
Now $[a,b]\setminus  \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}D_k$ is compact (closed and bounded) and included in $I$. 
As such it can be covered by 
$$F_x=(x-\delta_x,x+\delta_x)$$
where $ \delta_x>0:$ is chosen so that $\omega f((x-\delta_x,x+\delta_x)\cap [a,b])<\epsilon$.
Compactness implies the existence of a finite subcover,
$$[a,b]\setminus  \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}D_k\subseteq  \bigcup_{i=1}^{M}(x_i-\delta_i,x+\delta_i)$$
As we can replace the intervals that intersect we can suppose
 $$ \bigcap_{i=1}^{M}[x_i-\delta_i,x+\delta_i]=\emptyset$$
Therefore,
$$[a,b]=  \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}\overline{D}_k\cup  \bigcup_{i=1}^{M}[x_i-\delta_i,x+\delta_i]=\bigcup_{i=0}^{n}[t_{i-1},t_i]$$
where for $i\le n$, $[t_{i-1},t_i]=  [x_k-\delta_k,x+\delta_k]$ or $[t_{i-1},t_i]=  \overline{D}_k$ because
$$\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}\overline{D}_k\cap  \bigcup_{i=1}^{M}[x_i-\delta_i,x+\delta_i]=\emptyset$$
Considering all the endpoints of the above (that are pairwise different) we can create a partition $\mathcal{P}=\left\{a=t_0<...<t_n=b\right\}$ of $[a,b]$. We separate the indices: $A=\left\{i:[t_{i-1},t_i]=  [x_k-\delta_k,x+\delta_k]\right\}$ and $B=\left\{i:[t_{i-1},t_i]=  \overline{D}_k \right\}$. Therefore,
\begin{gather}U_{f,\mathcal{P}}-L_{f,\mathcal{P}}=\sum_{i=1}^n\omega f([t_{i-1},t_i])(t_i-t_{i-1})=\sum_{i\in A}\omega f([t_{i-1},t_i])\ell([t_{i-1},t_i])+\sum_{i\in B}\omega f([t_{i-1},t_i])\ell([t_{i-1},t_i])\\
\le \sum_{i\in A}2\left\|f\right\|\ell([t_{i-1},t_i])+\sum_{i\in B}\epsilon\ell(\overline{D}_k)\le 2\left\|f\right\|\frac{\epsilon}{M}+\epsilon(b-a)=2\epsilon+\epsilon(b-a)\end{gather} My questions are: Is this proof correct? ( I doubt the point:
""where for $i\le n$, $[t_{i-1},t_i]=  [x_k-\delta_k,x+\delta_k]$ or $[t_{i-1},t_i]=  \overline{D}_k$ because
$$\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}\overline{D}_k\cap  \bigcup_{i=1}^{M}[x_i-\delta_i,x+\delta_i]=\emptyset$$"")

Similarly, in real analysis, we saw that we can isometrically embed any metric space $(M,d)$ into another metric space $(\hat{M},\hat{d})$ where the image of $M$ under our isometry is dense in $\hat{M}$. But these facts were proved in similar ways. For groups, we map each $g \in G$ to $g \mapsto \sigma_g$ where $\sigma_g$ is defined as $\sigma_g(x) = gx$. For metric spaces, we fix $a \in M$ and map each $x \in M$ to $x \mapsto f_x$ where $f_x(y) = d(x,y) - d(a,x)$. The desired results follow.

263747,Geometric interpretation of the map $SO(4) \to SO(3)$,"Let me first explain the background of my question. As is well known, the group $SO(n+1)$ acts transitively on the sphere $S^n$, and the stabilizer is the group $SO(n)$, so that we get a fibration sequence
$$ SO(n) \to SO(n+1) \to S^n.$$ Indeed this fibration is a principal-$SO(n)$-bundle and can actually be identified with the frame bundle of the tangent bundle of $S^n$, i.e., the tangent bundle $TS^n$ is the associated bundle to this principal-$SO(n)$-bundle along the tautological representation of $SO(n)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Now let us consider the special case $n = 4$. Here we get a principal-$SO(3)$-bundle
$$ SO(3) \to SO(4) \to S^3.$$
But we can identify the $S^3$ with $Sp(1)$, the symplectic group acting on the quaternions. Via this identification $S^3$ sits canonically in $SO(4)$, i.e. we have an embedding of topological groups $S^3 \cong Sp(1) \to SO(4)$. The standard theory of principal-bundles hence tells us that the above bundle splits (topologically) which means that there is a homeomorphism
$$ SO(4) \cong SO(3)\times S^3 $$
in particular there is a continuous map $SO(4) \to SO(3)$ (which is not a morphism of lie groups). It is well known that the homotopy type $BSO(n)$ represents the functor of $n$-dimensional oriented vector bundles, and via the clutching function construction the group $SO(n)$ itself represents the functor of $n$-dimensional vector bundles over suspensions of spaces. Hence the above map $SO(4) \to SO(3)$ tells us that there is a natural transformation between the functor of rank $4$ vector bundles over suspensions to the functor of rank $3$ vector bundles over suspensions. Does anybody know a geometric construction of this transformation which I only understand homotopy theoretically?

My thoughts so far: For any $f(x)\in f(U)$, Taylor's theorem provides $\varepsilon>0$ so that whenever $\|z\|<\varepsilon$, $f(x+z)=f(x)+J_f(x)z+O(\|z\|^2)$. Choose $\delta>0$ so that whenever $r\in R^m$ and $\|r\|<\delta$ there is a $z\in R^n$ so that $r=J_f(x)z$, $\|z\|<\varepsilon$ and $x+z\in U$. Choose any $r\in R^m$ so that $\|r\|<\delta$. If we can find $z$ so that $f(x+z)-f(x)=r$, we will have shown that $f(x)$ is an interior point of $f(U)$. From the choice of $\delta$, we can choose $z\in R^n$ so that $\|z\|<\varepsilon$, and $x+z\in U$ and therefore $f(x+z)=f(x)+J_f(x)z+O(\|z\|^2)$ in other words $f(x+z)-f(x)=r+O(\|z\|^2)$.

Then there exists a $z_1\in\Bbb C$ such that $P(z_1)=0$. The proof sketch goes as follows: Lemma 1 For each $A>0$ there is an $R>0$ such that $|z|\geq R$ implies $|P(z)|\geq A$ Proof For $z\neq 0$, write $$P(z)=a_0z^n Q(z)$$ where $$Q(z)=\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{a_k}{a_0}z^{-k}$$ Then $Q\to 1$ for $z\to \infty$ so there is an $R_1$ for which $|z|\geq R_1$ implies $|Q(z)|\geq 1/2$. Thus for $|z|\geq R_1$ we have $$|P(z)|=|a_0||z|^n| Q(z)|\geq \frac 1 2 |a_0||z|^n$$ From this it is clear we can make $|P(z)|>A$ by taking $|z|>R$ where $$R=\max\left\{R_1,\left(\frac{2A}{|a_0|}\right)^{1/n}\right\}$$ Lemma 2 If $P$ is a polynomial of degree $\geq 1$ and $P(z_1)\neq 0$, given $\delta_0 >0$ there is a $z_2$ such that $|z_1-z_2|<\delta$ and $|P(z_2)|<|P(z_1|$ Proof Consider the particular case $P(0)=1$. We may then write $$P(z)=a_nz^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1z+1$$ Now let $a_k$ by the first coefficient $a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}$ that is nonvanishing. Then $$P(z)=1+a_kz^k+\cdots a_nz^n$$ so we may write $$P(z)=1+a_k z^k(1+H(z))$$ where $$H(z)=\frac{a_{k-1}}{a_k}z+\cdots+^\frac{a_0}{a_k}z^{n-k}$$ Since $H(0)=0$; by continuity $|H(z)|<\frac 1 2 $ for each $z$ with $|z|\leq \delta <\delta_0$, where $\delta$ is such that $\delta^k|a_k|<1$. We choose $z_2$ as a solution of $$z^k=-\delta^k\frac{|a_k|}{a_k}$$ Then clearly $|z_2|=\delta$ and $$|P(z_2)|=|1-\delta^k|a_k|-\delta^k|a_k||H(z_2)||\\ \leq 1-\delta^k|a_k|+\delta^k|a_k||H(z_2)|\\ \leq 1-\delta^k|a_k|+\frac 1 2\delta^k|a_k|<1$$

In the general case where $P(z_0)\neq 0$, we write $P(z)=\sum a_k z^k$ as $P(z)=\sum b_k(z-z_0)^k$ and note that $P(z)=b_n P_1(z)$ with $P_1(0)=1$, so we profit from what we did before. Finally, the proof PROOF Since $P$ is continuous so is $|P|$, and $|P|\geq 0$. Set thus $\alpha =\inf_{z\in \Bbb C}|P(z)|$. Since we can take, from the first lemma, an $R$ such that $|P(z)|\geq \alpha +1$ we may discard the region $|z|> R$ and write $$\alpha =\inf_{|z|\leq R}|P(z)|$$ By continuity of $|P|$ and compactness of the disk $K=\{z:|z|\leq R\}$, Weierstrass' theorem asserts that for some $z_1$ we have $|P(z_1)|=\alpha$. Since $|P(z_1)|=\alpha<\alpha+1$, $z_1$ is an interior point of the disk $K$, whence there is some $\delta_0$-ball around it. If $\alpha \neq 0$, the second lemma implies we can take some $z_2$ with $|z_1-z_2|<\delta_0$ and $|P(z_2)|<\alpha$ contrary to $\alpha$ being the infimum, whence $|P(z_1)|=\alpha=0$, which implies $P(z_1)=0$ and the theorem is proven. Does anyone know where this proof first appeared? Who produced it? I've seen it already in Spivak's ""Calculus"" and E.G. Shilov's ""Elementary Real and Complex Analysis"".","['complex-analysis', 'math-history', 'real-analysis']"
263853,Justifying an Assumption Made While Deriving the Method of Variation of Parameters,"I never fully understood the derivation of the method of variation of parameters. Consider the simple case $$y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x)\,.$$ The homogeneous solution is $y_h=c_1y_1+c_2y_2$ and the particular solution that we guess is $y_p =u_1y_1+u_2y_2$ for some function $u_1(t)$ and $u_2(t)$. Next we take derivatives of the particular solution and substitute those back into the original ODE. The part done next is the part I don't quite see the justification for.
We assume that our functions $u_1$ and $u_2$ will satisfy the constraint $$u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2=0\,,$$ and this particular constraint will yield a cleaner result when looking at $y'_p$: $$u_1'y_1'+u_2'y_2'=f(x)\,.$$ At least in the textbook I'm looking at, the justification for assuming that $u_1$ and $u_2$ satisfy $u_1'y_1 + u_2'y_2=0$ is simply omitted. How do we know that the solutions we're after satisfy that constraint? All other sources I look at just say something like, "" okay we are going to impose this constraint. Now moving on ... "" Could someone give me a proper explanation as to why we can make this assumption?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
