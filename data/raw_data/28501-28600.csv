264760,Compact and open subspaces using products,"I'm preparing for a topology prelim, and there's one question related to compactness that I'm trying to work on. Here it is: Let $C$ be a compact subspace of $X$, and $K$ be a compact subspace of $Y$. Now let $U$ be an open set in $X \times Y$ that contains $C \times K$. Show that there exist open subspaces $V$ of $X$ and $W$ of $Y$ such that $$C \times K \subset V \times W \subset U.$$ 
Well, certainly $C \times K$ is a compact subspace of $X \times Y$, right? Then this would mean that every covering of $C \times K$ by open sets in $X \times Y$ contains a finite subcollection covering $C \times K$. Can't you use $U$ as the open covering, and then somehow get a finite subcollection which might have something to do with the space $V \times W$? What am I missing here? I would appreciate some helpful input, thanks. My second attempt: Alright, I might as well let $U = A \times B$, $A,B$ open such that $C \subset A, K \subset  B$. Now we could let $\mathcal{C}$ be an open covering of $C$; since $C$ is compact, there is a finite subcollection $\{V_1, V_2, … ,V_n\}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ covering $C$. Next, let $V= A \cap (\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i)$. Then, $V \subset A$, $V$ open and $C \subset V$. Similarly, we can find $W$ such that $W \subset B$, $W$ open and $K \subset W$ so that $$C \times K \subset V \times W \subset A \times B= U.$$ 
I hope this was the right approach to take.",['general-topology']
264764,Limit of a function whose values depend on $x$ being odd or even,"I couldn't find an answer through google or here, so i hope this isn't a duplicate. Let $f(x)$ be given by: $$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
       x & : x=2n\\
       1/x & : x=2n+1
   \end{cases}
$$ Find $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x).$ The limit is different depending on $x$ being odd or even. So what's the limit of $f(x)$? Attempt: this limit doesn't exist because we have different values for $x \to \infty$ which could be either odd or even. My doubt is $\infty$ can't be both even and odd at the same time so one should apply. So what do you ladies/gents think?
Also, when confronted with functions like these and one needs to know the limit to gain more information about the behavior of $f(x)$, how should the problem be attacked?",['limits']
264771,Cross product and pseudovector confusion.,"So called pseudovectors pop up in physics when discussing quantities defined by cross products, such as angular momentum $\mathbf L=\mathbf r\times\mathbf p$. Under the active transformation $\mathbf x \mapsto \mathbf{-x}$, we claim that such a vector gets mapped to itself because $\mathbf{-r} \times \mathbf{-p} = \mathbf r\times\mathbf p$. (Or under the equivalent passive transformation, a pseudovector turns into to its negative.) But it seems like we're just pretending that a linear transformation $T$ preserve cross products, so that $T(\mathbf a \times \mathbf b) = T(\mathbf a) \times T(\mathbf b)$, and then when things don't go as expected we label the result as a pseudovector. Is there more to the story?","['linear-algebra', 'physics']"
264784,A question about the contractibility of the Sierpinski space,"The two-point Sierpinski space is usually defined as follows: Let $X =\{x,y\}$ be the two-point space where the only open sets are $X, \varnothing, \{x\}$. I think from this it can be inferred that $X, \varnothing, \{y\}$ are closed, correct? Then this information can be used to show that $X$ is in fact connected. I believe you can also show that it is path  connected; a path from $0$ to $1$ in $X$ is given by the function: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(t) = 1$ for $t > 0$. The function $f : I → X$ is continuous since $f^{−1}(1) = (0,1]$, which is open in $I$. Now I know that a space $Y$ is contractible provided that we have id$_Y \simeq e_{y_0}$, i.e. the identity map of $Y$ is homotopic to the constant map $e_{y_0}$ (definition of being nulhomotopic). My question is how can you show that the two-point Sierpinski space is contractible? Doesn't that just require ""tweaking"" the function $f$ that was used to show that $X$ is path connected? Also, recall that a space is contractible provided that it is both path connected and simply connected. How would this approach go?","['general-topology', 'homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"

264799,Calculating the total number of surjective functions,"It is quite easy to calculate the total number of functions from a set $X$ with $m$ elements to a set $Y$ with $n$ elements ($n^{m}$), and also the total number of injective functions ($n^{\underline{m}}$, denoting the falling factorial). But I am thinking about how to calculate the total number of surjective functions $f\colon X \twoheadrightarrow Y $. The way I thought of doing this is as follows: firstly, since all $n$ elements of the codomain $Y$ need to be mapped to, you choose any $n$ elements from the $m$ elements of the set $X$ to be mapped one-to-one with the $n$ elements of $Y$. This results in $n!$ possible pairings. But the number of ways of choosing $n$ elements from $m$ elements is $\frac{m!}{(m-n)!\,n!}$, so the total number of ways of matching $n$ elements in $X$ to be one-to-one with the $n$ elements of $Y$ is $\frac{m!}{(m-n)!\,n!} \times n! = \frac{m!}{(m-n)!}$. Now we have 'covered' the codomain $Y$ with $n$ elements from $X$, the remaining unpaired $m-n$ elements from $X$ can be mapped to any of the elements of $Y$, so there are $n^{m-n}$ ways of doing this. Therefore I think that the total number of surjective functions should be $\frac{m!}{(m-n)!} \, n^{m-n}$. Is this anything like correct or have I made a major mistake here?","['stirling-numbers', 'functions', 'combinatorics']"

264805,Absolute continuity inside the interval extends to the endpoint of the interval under some constraints,"The below problem appeared on the UW-Madison Analysis qualifying exam in January 2020. The proof that $f$ is absolutely continuous (AC) on the whole interval is still not posted, although the requested counterexample has been given. I don't seem to find version of this problem in the site, but I am sure this is pretty standard type of question. The problem goes likes this: Let $f$ be of bounded variation on $[0,1]$ and AC on $[\varepsilon,1]$ for all $\varepsilon >0$ . $f$ is also continuous at $0$ . Prove $f$ is absolutely continuous on  whole interval $[0,1]$ . Moreover I am looking for a counterexample in the case when the bounded variation of $f $ is dropped. Here is what I think, Using continuity, I can find $\delta>0$ for given $\epsilon >0$ which bounds the sum in the definition of AC upto $\delta$ . Then in the interval $[\delta,1]$ , I can use given hypothesis. But I am not totally comfortable writing this rigorously. For the counter example I can use $f(0)=0$ and $f(x)= x\sin (1/x)$ for $x$ not equal to $0$ .

264817,"Proof that not all boxes can be wrapped ""perfectly""","It's often claimed that it's possible to wrap gifts in normal 6-sided boxes ""perfectly"", meaning that the seam on the back side matches the pattern on the paper it overlaps. I'm convinced that it's possible to prove, mathematically, that this is not possible, but my math skills are too deteriorated to actually do so. It seems to me that, in order to accomplish a ""perfect"" wrapping job, the length of the diameter of the box to be matched must be a multiple of the length of the pattern and that no amount of folding can overcome this requirement. Can anyone prove that this is true? This may be a little more trivial than this site usually caters to, but it seems seasonally appropriate... As a last minute note, it occurred to me this morning that, each time you go around the box, the diameter of the outermost later increases slightly, which means that, given an infinite amount of paper, you could increase the diameter sufficiently to create a match. I seriously doubt that anyone actually wraps gifts in inches of paper though...",['geometry']
264820,"A relationship between matrices, bernoulli polynomials, and binomial coefficients","We define the following polynomials, for $n≥0$:
$$P_n(x)=(x+1)^{n+1}-x^{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\binom{n+1}{k}x^k}$$
For $n=0,1,2,3$ this gives us,
$$P_0(x)=1\enspace P_1(x)=2x+1\enspace P_2(x)=3x^2+3x+1\enspace P_3(x)=4x^3+6x^2+4x+1$$ We then define the set $P_{(3)}=\{P_0,P_1,P_2,P_3\}$. It can be easily shown that this set is a basis over the vector space of polynomials of degree $3$ and lower. We take $3$ for the sake of brevity. Taking the coefficients of these polynomials and turning them into column vectors, we can construct the matrix (coefficients from the lowest term to the highest term)
$$\large{M_{P_{(3)}}}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 0 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
 0 & 0 & 3 & 6 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 4
\end{pmatrix}$$
We'll call this matrix the pascal in the context of this post, and the above polynomials as pascal polynomials. 
The inverse of this matrix is the matrix,
$$M_{P_{(3)}}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{6} & 0 \\
 0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{4} \\
 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{3} & -\frac{1}{2} \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4}
\end{pmatrix}$$ We'll factor this matrix into two matrices as follows: $$M_{P_{(3)}}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{3} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4}

 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{6} & 0 \\

 0 & 0 & 0 & 1

264841,Dimension of An Ultraproduct Field as a Vector Space over Another Ultraproduct Field,"Suppose $F \subseteq K$ are fields with $G$ an ultrafilter on an infinite set $X$.  If $F^{\ast}$ and $K^{\ast}$ represent the ultraproducts respectively of $F$ and $K$, it is easy to see that $[K : F]$ is finite if and only if $[K^{\ast} : F^{\ast}]$ is finite.  Denote a typical element of $K^{\ast}$ by $a^{\ast}$, where $a$ is a member of $\prod_{i \in X}K$.  Also if $a \in K$, denote by $a^{\ast}$ the equivalence class in $K^{\ast}$ of the constant $a$-sequence in $\prod_{i \in X}K$. If $[K : F]$ is finite, let $v_1, ... , v_n$ be a basis for $K$ over $F$.  It then follows that $v_1^{\ast}, ... , v_n^{\ast}$ is a basis for $K^{\ast}$.  For if $a^{\ast} \in K^{\ast}$, then for every $i \in X$, $a(i) \in K$ so there exist scalars $c_{i1}, ... , c_{in} \in F$ such that $a(i) = c_{i1}v_1 + ... + c_{in}v_n$.  For each $1 \leq j \leq n$ we define $c_j \in \prod_{ i \in X}F$ by $c_j(i) = c_{ij}$.  It follows that, for every $i \in X$, $a(i) = c_1(i)v_1 + ... + c_n(i)v_n$, which implies $a^{\ast} = c_1^{\ast}v_1^{\ast} + ... + c_n^{\ast}v_n^{\ast}$.  Thus $v_1^{\ast}, ... , v_n^{\ast}$ span $K^{\ast}$.  To show linear independence, suppose $c_1^{\ast}, ... , c_n^{\ast} \in F^{\ast}$ are such that $c_1^{\ast}v_1^{\ast} + ... + c_n^{\ast}v_n^{\ast} = 0$.  Then $Q = \{ i \in X : c_1(i)v_1 + ... + c_n(i)v_n = 0 \} \in G$.  But for any such $i \in Q$, by the linear independence of $v_1, ... , v_n$ we get that $c_1(i), ... , c_n(i) = 0$.  In other words for every $1 \leq j \leq n$, $Q \subseteq \{ i \in X : c_j(i) = 0\}$.  But this just means that $c_1^{\ast}, ... , c_n^{\ast} = 0$.  This means that $v_1^{\ast}, ... , v_n^{\ast}$ form a basis for $K^{\ast}$ over $F^{\ast}$. Conversely if $[K : F]$ is infinite, let $B$ be a basis for $K$ over $F$.  Let $B'$ be the set with the elements $v \in B$ replaced by the equivalence class of their constant sequence in $\prod_{i \in X}K$, as $v^{\ast}$.  Then $B'$ is a linearly independent set, i.e. any finite subset thereof is linearly independent.  For if $v_1^{\ast}, ... , v_n^{\ast}$ are finitely many members of $B'$ with $c_1^{\ast}v_1^{\ast} + ... + c_n^{\ast}v_n^{\ast} = 0$ for some $c_1^{\ast}, c_2^{\ast}$ etc. $\in F^{\ast}$, then we can apply the same argument in the previous paragraph to show that $c_1^{\ast}, ... , c_n^{\ast}$ are all $0$.  Thus $B'$ is a linearly independent subset.  But any basis of $K^{\ast}$ would have cardinality at least as great as that of $B'$.  But there are as many elements in $B'$ as there are in $B$, which by supposition is infinite.  Therefore $[K^{\ast} : F^{\ast}]$ must be infinite. Now my question is, what can be said about the cardinality of $[K^{\ast} : F^{\ast}]$ in the infinite dimensional case, besides the fact that it is at least as great as $[K : F]$? For every set containing $B'$ I have tried, for example $\pi(\prod_{i \in X}B)$ (where $\pi: \prod_{i \in X}K \rightarrow K^{\ast}$ is the canonical homomorphism), linear independence or span are each too much to hope for.  An explicit basis for $K^{\ast}$ may be just about as easy to find as an explicit ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$.","['filters', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
264851,How to calculate probability of these two pair-of-sums ($S_{n}$ and $T_{n}$) and ($SEvenF_{n}$ and $SOddF_{n}$) being the same?,"Say we have a sequence of $n$ positive integers, we can assume they're randomly chosen, let's call it $U_{n}$.

For example, you can restrict $U_{n}$ and $F_{n}$ to be within $[1, 400]$ for the $n=114$ case. Or you can restrict them to be within $[1, Cn]$ with some constant $C$ for the general case.

264857,What is the difference between projective geometry and affine geometry?,"I recently started reading the book Multiple View Geometry by Hartley and Zisserman.

Then he says a line which I cannot relate is the following.. The geometry of the projective plane and a distinguished line is known as Affine Geometry and any projective transformation that maps the distinguished line in one space to the distinguished line of the other space is known as an Affine transform. I have the following questions Is the camera plane the projective space of the real world? Is the line which is the image of the horizon the distinguished line? Whenever we do an Affine transform do we need to look out for a distinguished line?

This is still early in the book, so I'm only hanging out in the world of sets and functions. Proposed definition:  A function $f:A\rightarrow B$ is epic if for all $Z$ and all $\alpha, \alpha ':B\rightarrow Z$, $\alpha \circ f=\alpha' \circ f\implies\alpha=\alpha'$. With this definition in mind I want the statement that $f$ is epic iff $f$ is surjective.  Showing surjectivity implies epic wasn't hard so long as I know surjective means $f$ has a right inverse.

265097,higher order uncertainty,"Context: As a general rule of thumb parameter estimation (in data analysis) works better the fewer the biased assumptions one makes. For instance, when presented with a coin and trying to estimate the true likelihood $H$ for the coin to fall on heads one can first guess a value for $H$ and adapt it as one proceeds with flips. One may claim that the guess $H=0.5$ is the least biased of all choices. I will call this $0$-order uncertainty. Another possibility is not to choose a value for $H$ but rather choose a distribution over the values of $H$. It would seem that choosing the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$ is the least biased one. I will refer to this as first order uncertainty. It seems natural to adopt the same technique and go on: Instead of choosing a distribution $D\in D([0,1])$, the space of distributions over $[0,1]$, choose instead a distribution $D\in D(D([0,1]))$. Call this second order uncertainty. It would seem that the uniform distribution over $D([0,1])$ expresses a higher degree of uncertainty than the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ does. Of course this doesn't stop there. Define $D^n=D(D^{n-1})$, with $D^0=[0,1]$. Choosing an element of $D^n$ for the analysis I will call $n$-order uncertainty. So, the questions are: 1) Is there an example where parameter estimation is done in this higher order context and compared to more ordinary first order uncertainty? 2) Is there a way to formalize the intuitive notion that $n$ order uncertainty expresses less certainty than $n-1$ order uncertainty? Strictly more? 3) Can this idea be pushed to $\infty$? That is, obtain $D^\infty $ as a limit of the $D^n$'s such that $\infty$-order uncertainty then represents the least possible bias.",['probability-theory']

Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ be non-negative real numbers such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 1$, and let $Y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \alpha_i X_i$. Prove (or disprove): $\Pr(Y\ge p)\ge p$. I can prove this for all $p=\frac{1}{k}$, $k\ge3$, but intuitively it seems to me that it should be true for all $p<\frac{1}{2}$, and I could not find a proof for that. EDIT: my (or rather, a friend's) proof for $p = \frac{1}{k}$: For each Bernoulli variable define a random variable $Z_i$ that takes values from a set of formal objects $\{b_1,\ldots b_k\}$ uniformly, and define a function $f$ on these formal objects as $f(b_1) = 1$, $\forall_{i>1}f(b_i)=0$. Clearly, $f(Z_i)$ is a Bernoulli variable with probability $p$, but the sample space for a convex combination of $f(Z_1),\ldots f(Z_n)$ can be now viewed as consisting of $k^n$ states of the form $(b_{i_1},\ldots,b_{i_n})$ from which one is selected uniformly. Group these states into sets of $k$ states of cyclic shifts of the indices (that is, $(b_{i_1},\ldots,b_{i_n})$ and $(b_{j_1},\ldots,b_{j_n})$ are in the same set iff for all for all $1\le s \le n$, $b_{j_s} = b_{i_s} + c (\mod k)$ for some $s$-independent integer $c$). The sum of the values of a convex combination of such sets under $f$ is exactly $1$, since each component is $b_0$ in exactly one member of the set, so in each set there exists at least one state whose value is greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{k}$. To sum up, I have proven that the new sample space can be divided into sets of $k$ points such that in each set there exists at least one point valued above (or at) $\frac{1}{k}$, and the probability of choosing such a point is at least $\frac{1}{k}$.","['probability', 'random-variables']"

265405,Topology: The Board Game,"Edit: I've drawn up some different rules, a map and some cards for playing an actual version of the game. They're available at my personal website with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. This is a math education question that I've been thinking of when taking and teaching topology. For a few years now I've had an idea for a board game that could help teach students topology. However, I've had trouble working out the specifics, and wondered if the community would be able to help. Of course, this may be closed for being off topic, but if so, I'll post a link where we could continue the conversation elsewhere for those interested. Setup: Basically like battleship. The playing board would be squares of transparent paper (or chessboards, go boards, etc.). Players secretly place markers (which are circles) indicating where gardens are (or mines, etc.) on their paper, hidden from the other player. A card is then flipped over selecting a topology. Players then send five agents to the other player's board; the agents are points. If the points are placed directly in the garden, the player gets his opponents garden. If not, each agent has the option of moving (in a topological path) or of setting off a bomb. Bombs explode to form an open set; any agents or gardens caught in the bomb perish (so you may have to sacrifice your agents). Players describe the shape of the bomb, and their opponent tells them if they've hit the hidden gardens. At the end of the round, players gain one point for each garden they possess and lose two points for each agent lost. Possible topologies include: -Discrete topology: Bombs can take any shape, but agents cannot move. -Indiscrete topology: Agents can move anywhere, but the only possible bomb is a total nuke. -Finite complement topology: Agents can still move anywhere, but bombs can miss the agents. -Dictionary order: Most interesting if agents aren't allowed to move through each other. -Product topology: Each direction is one of discrete/indiscrete/finite complement/standard -Metric topology: In metric topology, we require bombs to be formed of metric balls. Then we have the standard metric, the square metric, etc. -Torus topology: Identify opposing edges (could do other surfaces, use orientation perhaps) -Subspace topology: Players place an overlay on their boards marking out a subset (like 
topologist's sine curve, etc.) and then flip over another topology to combine with the overlay. Now, I think this could be made more interesting. Possible variants could include that agents don't find gardens when placed in them until they do a ""search"" which means they can detect gardens in a compact connected set containing them (but the test only detects if there is at least one garden, so if the only compact set in the whole space is the space itself, the test is always positive). I'm sure you all could think of many improvements and better rules. I think this could really help people learning topology for the first time. I would have loved to had it for my students this last semester. What ideas do you have to incorporate other parts of topology (like connectedness or algebraic topology) and how could scoring and set up be improved? In other words, how could this be made playable with real strategies? I don't want this to end up like Quidditch. Thanks, and happy Boxing Day! Edit: I forgot to mention, I don't know whether it would be better to do analog (paper and pen) or discrete (pegs on a go board).","['general-topology', 'education', 'algebraic-topology', 'soft-question', 'recreational-mathematics']"

I can see that Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is equivalent to saying that $I A_f = A_f$ where $A_f$ is the localized ring with respect to the multiplicative set $1,f,f^2,\cdots$ and $I A_f$ is the ideal generated by the image of $I$ in $A_f$. My question is: how can we prove that $I A_f = A_f$? (obviously without using Hilbert's Nullstellensatz) (Edited) Idea: Let $f, I$ be defined as above. It is enough to show that $IA_f$ is an ideal that does not have any zeros in $\bar{k}$. Then we can use the result that if an ideal does not have any zeros, then it must contain $1$ and so $I A_f = A_f$ follows. How do we define the zeros of $I A_f$ in $\bar{k}$? Intuitively, these would consist of $n$-tuples over $\bar{k}$ such that $f$ does not vanish. (How can we make this more rigorous?)

It is clear that $u(z) = \log|z+1|$ is harmonic as long as $|z| < 1$. Also $u(z)$ is well defined for $|z|=1, z\ne -1$. This means that $u(0) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} u(r\exp(i\theta))\,d\theta \,\,\,\forall r \lt 1$. Because $r$ can be chosen arbitrarily close to 1, is this sufficient to conclude the validity of the mean value formula even for $r = 1$? $u(\exp(i\theta))= \log(2|\cos\frac{\theta}{2}|)$. Assuming the validity for $r=1$, I get $u(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}(\log2 + \log|\cos(\frac{\theta}{2})|)\,d\theta$. But $u(0)=0$, and from the last integral I finally get $\int_0^{\pi}\log|\cos(\theta)|\,d\theta = -\pi \log(2)$. However, if I use $u(z) = \log|z-1|$, the desired result $\int_0^{\pi}\log\,\sin(\theta)\,d\theta = -\pi \log(2)$ is obtained. It occurs to me that both the integrals should evaluate to same value of $-\pi \log(2)$ because $|\cos(\theta)|$ and $\sin(\theta)$ span the same area in $0\le\theta\le\pi$. However I verified from http://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=8ab70731b1553f17c11a3bbc87e0b605 and it evaluates $\int_0^{\pi}\log|\cos(\theta)|\,d\theta = -\pi \log(2) + i\epsilon$ where $epsilon$ is very small.
