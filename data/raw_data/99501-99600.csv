1377913,Generalization of the Vitali-Hahn-Saks Theorem,Is there a generalization of the Vitali-Hahn-Saks Theorem for nets of measures? I do not find any related literature.

1377921,"Why does $ \int_0^1 \lceil { x\sin({1 \over x})} \rceil \,dx = 1 - \frac{\log(4)}{2\pi} $?","One time I was bored and played around a bit with integrals and wolfram alpha and tested the following integral: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral_0%5E1+ceil%28x*sin%281%2Fx%29%29 Note: The result at my laptop shows: $ \int_0^1 \lceil { x\sin({1 \over x})} \rceil  \,dx  = 1 - \frac{\log(4)}{2\pi} $ I was a bit surprised seeing this and wondered, if this result makes any sense and if yes, if there were an explanation, where $\frac{\log(4)}{2\pi}$ exactly comes from.

1377970,What's special about the Cauchy product?,"I am reading chapter 3 in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. In it, Rudin defines the Cauchy product of two series. That is, given $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$, $c_n=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}$ and $\sum c_n$ is defined as the product of the series. What I don't understand is the motivation for the particular product. You could define the product as follows: Say $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^na_n$ and $B_n=\sum_{k=0}^nb_n$. So that $A_n B_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\sum_{i=0}^n a_k b_i=C_n$ Further assume that $A_n \rightarrow A$ and $B_n \rightarrow B$, We'll have that $A_n B_n \rightarrow AB$ since the multiplication of two convergent series is convergent.

1378133,Is the ring of holomorphic functions on $S^1$ Noetherian?,"Let $S^1={\{ z \in \Bbb{C} : |z|=1 \}}$ be the unit circle. Let $R= \mathcal{H}(S^1)$ be the ring of holomorphic functions on $S^1$, i.e. the ring of functions $f: S^1 \longrightarrow \Bbb{C}$ which can be extended to an holomorphic function on an open neighbourhood of $S^1$. My question is: Is $R$ is a Noetherian ring? What I tried: We can think $R$ as a direct limit $$R= \lim_{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{H}(\Omega_n)$$
where $\Omega_n = \{ z \in \Bbb{C} : 1-\frac{1}{n} < |z| < 1+\frac{1}{n}\}$ denotes the open annulus of amplitude $2/n$ for $n\ge3$, and 
$$\mathcal{H}(\Omega_3) \longrightarrow \mathcal{H}(\Omega_4) \longrightarrow \mathcal{H}(\Omega_5) \longrightarrow \dots$$
is a direct system of rings whose maps are restrictions.
Since restrictions are injective ring morphisms, we can think $R= \bigcup_n \mathcal{H}(\Omega_n)$ In particular $R$ is a Bezout domain (every finitely generated ideal of $R$ is principal). Now, if $R$ were Noetherian, then $R$ would be a PID. And here I got stuck: it could be possible that this is non-Noetherian since it is a union of non-Noetherian rings on the other hand $S^1$ is compact, so every function $f \in R$ can only have a finite number of zeroes: this gives me intuition that maybe $R$ is a UFD.","['abstract-algebra', 'noetherian', 'complex-analysis', 'ring-theory']"

1378244,Brownian motion: Strong Markov versus translation invariance,"In the proof of the reflection principle in Durrett's textbook ( Probability: Theory and Examples (4e) , Theorem 8.4.1, page 317), there's a step which I'm a little shaky on. Basically, this proof invokes the strong Markov property so to set this up in Durrett's notation, let $B_s$ denote Brownian motion and define (I think for fixed $t$ here, but correct me if I'm wrong):
$$
Y_s(\omega) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \textrm{if } s<t,\, \omega(t-s)>a\\
0, & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
Then defining the stopping time $S = \inf\{s<t: B_s=a\}$ (and $\inf \emptyset = \infty$), we get:
$$
Y_S(\theta_S \omega) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \textrm{if } S<t,\, B_t>a\\
0, & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $\theta_S$ is the usual random shift operator for elements of $\mathcal{C}[0,\infty)$. So far, so good. This took a while to wrap my head around but it makes sense. Applying the strong Markov property we get
$$ E_0(Y_S \circ \theta_S | \mathcal{F}_S) = E_{B_S} Y_S \textrm{ on } \{S < \infty\}$$
Now taking expectations, Durrett gets:
$$ P_0(T_a < t, B_t \geq a) = E_0(Y_S \circ \theta_S; S < \infty) $$
I'm not seeing the right hand side. I'm trying to see how
$$ E_0 (E_{B_S} Y_S; S < \infty) = E_0(Y_S \circ \theta_S; S<\infty) $$
but I'm getting confused. Does this somehow involve translation invarance of $B_s$ or is it straight from the definition of $Y_S$ and I'm just missing something obvious? EDIT : Just putting @saz's solution here to clear up exactly where the strong Markov property is used. Essentially integrating $Y_S(\theta_S \omega)$ on $\{S < \infty\}$ and writing it as:
$$E_0(Y_S \circ \theta_S; S < \infty) = E_0(E_0(Y_S \circ \theta_S | \mathcal{F}_S); S < \infty)$$
It becomes obvious where to apply the Markov property.","['brownian-motion', 'probability', 'stochastic-processes']"

1378327,Show that $(1+p/n)^n$ is a Cauchy sequence for arbitrary $p$,"It is a generalization of this question. I am looking for a similar derivation as in here . Can we prove that $(1+p/n)^n$ is a Cauchy sequence for any $p \in [a, b]$ by showing that $$ \Bigg| \left( 1 + \frac{p}{n}\right)^n - \left( 1 + \frac{p}{m}\right)^m \Bigg| \leq f(n)$$ where $f(n)$ is something that tends to zero as $n$ goes to infinity? Here is an attempt. Let $m=n+1$. Then, $$ \Bigg| \left( 1 + \frac{p}{n}\right)^n - \left( 1 + \frac{p}{n+1}\right)^{n+1} \Bigg| = \Bigg| \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\left( \frac{p}{n} \right)^{k} - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k}\left( \frac{p}{n+1} \right)^{k} \Bigg| = \\
\Bigg| \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \left[ \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n+1} \right) - \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n} \right) \right] + \frac{p^{n+1}}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \Bigg| \leq
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{|p|^k}{k!} \left[ \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n+1} \right) - \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n} \right) \right] + \Bigg| \frac{p^{n+1}}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \Bigg|
$$ Now intuitively, $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{|p|^k}{k!}$ tends to the constant $e^{|p|}$ while the expression in square brackets tends to zero as $n$ goes to infinity. I was trying to show that this expression is less than a constant divided by $n^2$ (because we will sum up the consecutive terms for $m >n$, and the sum should converge which $\frac{C}{n^2}$ would provide). Can we also find an estimate of the constant $C$? Thanks to all for good answers. Meanwhile, I'm still quite interested in working it out algebraically. My next idea was to use the triangle inequality. Let us ignore the last term in the inequality above, it obviously tends to zero as $n$ goes to infinity. We want the sum to go to zero fast enough. So, $$ \Bigg| \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n+1} \right) - \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n} \right) \Bigg| \leq \\
\Bigg| \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n} \right) - \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \Bigg| + \\
\Bigg| \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 1 - \frac{i}{n+1} \right) - \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{p^k}{k!} \Bigg|
$$ Each product is evidently positive and smaller than one. So we end up having kind of a usual exponential series, but weighted. Otherwise, we could try to plug something instead of the products, what would, when subtracted from the products, give something which decreases fast enough. I feel this should be possible since we have all the freedom to plug in whatever we want.","['contest-math', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'combinatorics']"

  of $T$ are at least $\sqrt{3}$ units apart. It suffices to prove the claim for $n=8,15,22,\dots\text{ (for which }|T|=2,3,4,\dots)$, as these are the values at which a new point enters $T$. The $|T| = 2$ case can be proven for $n=8$ (possibly for $n=7$ if you sharpen the half-plane restriction). For any set of points in the plane, there is at least one point on the convex hull of this set. Let this point be $P$. Then all other points must be weakly within (possibly on the boundary) a half-plane through this point. So if we imagine other points in a fan arrangement around $P$, the total fan angle must be $\le 180^\circ$. In the diagram below, there are points $Q_0,Q_1,\dots,Q_6$ and angles $\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_6$ ($i$ ranges from $1$ to $6$). Assume that it is possible to arrange the seven $Q$ points in a half-plane about $P$, such that each point is within $\sqrt{3}$ of $P$ and at least $1$ from any other points. Points are labeled in clockwise order. Consider the angle $\theta_i$. By the cosine rule $\cos\theta_i = \dfrac{|PQ_{i-1}|^2+|PQ_i|^2-|Q_{i-1}Q_i|^2}{2|PQ_{i-1}|\cdot|PQ_i|} = \dfrac{1}{2} \Bigg(\dfrac{|PQ_{i-1}|}{|PQ_i|} + \dfrac{|PQ_i|}{|PQ_{i-1}|}\Bigg) - \dfrac{|Q_{i-1}Q_i|^2}{2|PQ_{i-1}|\cdot|PQ_i|}$. The first two terms always sum to at least $1$ (by AM-GM) and the last term can be minimised by taking $|Q_{i-1}Q_i|=1,\:|PQ_{i-1}|=|PQ_i|=\sqrt{3}$. Thus $\cos\theta_i \ge 1 - \dfrac{1^2}{2\cdot\sqrt3\cdot\sqrt3} = \dfrac{5}{6}$ So $\theta_i \ge \arccos(\frac{5}{6}) \gtrapprox 33.5^\circ$ Then $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{6}{\theta_i} \gtrapprox 201^\circ$, so the $Q_i$ cannot all be in the same half-plane and within $\sqrt3$ of $P$, invalidating the original assumption. Thus, there is at least one pair of points at a distance exceeding $\sqrt3$.","['contest-math', 'geometry', 'trigonometry']"

Euclid showed (Book III, Proposition 16) that $r$ does not intersect the semicircle at any point other than $P$. I'd like help to show that $r$ satisfies the calculus definition of the tangent line to the semicircle at $P$. For this, we have to show that if $y$ is the function whose graph is the semicircle, then
$$\lim_{x\to p_1}\frac{y(x)-y(p_1)}{x-p_1}$$
exists. Since the slope of $\overline{OP}$ is $-p_2/p_1$ we know that the value of the limit have to be $\displaystyle \frac{p_1}{p_2}=\frac{p_1}{y(p_1)}$. This is a part of the John Molokach's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. So, we can not use the expression $y(x)^2=|\overline{OP}|^2-x^2$. Thanks. EDIT. Possible answer to my question: (Is it right?) It is enough to prove that the limits
$$\lim_{x\to p_1^+}\frac{y(x)-y(p_1)}{x-p_1}\tag{1}$$
and
$$\lim_{x\to p_1^-}\frac{y(x)-y(p_1)}{x-p_1}\tag{2}$$
exists and are equal.
Given $x\in(p_1,0)$, consider the lines $s(x)$, $t(x)$ and $u(x)$ as in the picture below. Notice that
$$\text{slope of }t(x)\leq\text{slope of }s(x)\leq\text{slope of }r=\frac{p_1}{y(p_1)}.$$
So, if we assume $y$ continuous, we conclude that
$$\lim_{x\to p_1^+}[\text{slope of }t(x)]=\lim_{x\to p_1^+}\frac{x}{y(x)}=\frac{p_1}{y(p_1)}.$$
It follows from the squeeze theorem that
$$\lim_{x\to p_1^+}[\text{slope of }s(x)]=\frac{p_1}{y(p_1)}.$$
This shows that the limit $(1)$ exists and is equal to $p_1/y(p_1)$ because
$$\frac{y(x)-y(p_1)}{x-p_1}=\text{slope of }u(x)=\text{slope of }s(x).$$ The limit $(2)$ can be dealt analogously and a similar reasoning works if $p_1>0$.","['euclidean-geometry', 'calculus', 'limits', 'geometry', 'derivatives']"

1379213,Simple differential equation( introduction but need some basic explanation),"I have a couple of questions before I dig deeper into my calculus book. First: I have learned that 
$\frac{d}{dx}\frac{x}{y}$=$\frac{y x'-x y'}{y^2}$ never really gotten a proper explanation for why suddenly when its differential equations it becomes as they have defined it in my book: $$\mathrm {d}(\frac{x}{y})=\frac{y\mathrm dx-x\mathrm dy}{y^2}$$ I see algebraically that this is simply dividing by dx, but I HATE when I do not get a proper explanation for it. Second is a more specific case from the start of the book: $$x^2 y\mathrm {dy}-(x\mathrm dy-y\mathrm dx)=0$$ Now If I divide by $x^2$ $$y \mathrm dy-\mathrm{d}\left[\frac{x}{y}\right]=0$$, Now I get what the point of doing this is: 
However it is the result that throws me off: 
$y^2/2-x/y=c$ But I am integrating both why is the constant positive. Is it simply just that c can take on a negative value, why does not the c's cancel out since I integrate both. I am not sure how to interpret this. Last question: $$\pm \frac{\mathrm {d}\left(x^2+y^2\right)}{2 \sqrt{x^2+y^2}}=\mathrm {dx}$$ Solving this produces $$\pm \sqrt{x^2+y^2}=c+x$$, However, I do not see how this makes it any easier unless $\mathrm {d}\left(x^2+y^2\right)=2x$, but if that's the case I am even more confused
since in this case y disappears as I am used to dealing with derivatives since nowhere it is stated that $y$ is a function of $x$. But that to me conflicts what happens in what i wrote under First. Could someone please explain in detail why in the last instance: $\frac{\mathrm d\left(x^2+y^2\right)}{\mathrm dx}=2 y \frac{\mathrm dy}{\mathrm dx}+2 x$ is not the case, but simply $2x$.

Matrix addition and subtraction are only defined for matrices of the same size. However, it seems tedious to first multiply $b$ with a matrix of ones to have two same-sized matrices to add: $$ J_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$ Thus to write: $$ \begin{pmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22}\end{pmatrix} + bJ_2  = \begin{pmatrix}a_{11}+b & a_{12}+b \\ a_{21}+b & a_{22}+b\end{pmatrix}.$$ Do you always write $A+bJ_d$ (with $d$ the dimensions of $A$)? Another notation would be $A+\mathbf{b}$ (bold $b$), implying a matrix of the size of $A$. However, this notation is also used for the multiplication of $b$ with the identity matrix, $bI_d$, which is different and therefore confusing. Why is the addition of a scalar to a matrix not simply defined like scalar multiplication, i.e. an operation of every matrix element? An example where this is permitted is the MATLAB language, where you can add a scalar to a matrix $A$ simply by addition: e.g. A+3 . I feel this is a logical choice. Addition of a scalar to a matrix could be defined as $A+b = A+bJ_d$, with $d$ the dimensions of $A$. This is commutative and associative, just like regular matrix addition. Then $A+\mathbf{b}$ would be the addition of $A$ and $bI_d$ and $A+B$ the matrix addition as we know it, only valid for matrices of the same dimensions.

f(x)&=\frac12-x\\
g(x)&=x-\frac12.
\end{align} However, $g(x)=-f(x)$ and thus $\Vert g \Vert_1 = \Vert f \Vert_1 $ . Moreover, $\Vert f+g \Vert_1 = 0$ and $$\Vert f-g \Vert_1 = \Vert 2f \Vert_1 = 2\Vert f \Vert_1.$$ Finally I get: \begin{align}
\Vert f+g \Vert_1^2 + \Vert f-g \Vert_1^2 &= 4\Vert f \Vert_1^2\\ &= 2(2\Vert f \Vert_1^2)\\&= 2( \Vert f\Vert_1^2 + \Vert g \Vert_1^2 )

But how could I prove it? My idea was to show two things: $f(p^n)=n+1$ $f(pq)=f(p)f(q)$ if $\gcd(p,q)=1$. To prove the basic statement that $f(p)=2$, I tried to set $b=1$ and use complex numbers. I could prove some small cases, namely $p=3$ and $p=5$, by looking to the sum and products of the complex roots. But I couldn't generalize it. I also tried to use the identity $\gcd(x^a-1, x^b-1)=x^{\gcd(a,b)}-1$, but this says nothing about other possible factors of lower degree. Lastly I tried to involve group theory, because the number of subgroups of $C_n$ is $\tau(n)$ and the complex roots form a cyclic group as well. But I have no idea how to proceed. The problem has been solved, but it has a nice corollary: The number of factors of $a^{2n}-b^{2n}=(a^n-b^n)(a^n+b^n)$ is $\tau(2n)$, and the number of factors of $a^n-b^n$ is $\tau(n)$. So $a^n+b^n$ has $\tau(2n)-\tau(n)$ polynomial factors. Similiarly, one can get: The number of factors of $a^n-b^n$ is $\tau(n)$. The number of factors of $a^n+b^n$ is $\tau(2n)-\tau(n)$. The number of factors of $a^{2n}+a^nb^n+b^{2n}$ is $\tau(3n)-\tau(n)$.

Consider the formula defining the gradient: $g(\nabla f,X) = \Bbb d f (X)$. If $f$ takes only real values everything is fine. If $f$ takes general complex values, then $\nabla f$ will be a vector field with complex components, and since $g$ is a section in a real vector bundle, what meaning does the above formula have? I thought about complexifying the tangent bundle (by tensorizing with $\Bbb C$), but what should I do with $g$? If I promote it to a Hermitian form $g_{\Bbb C} (U + \Bbb i V, X + \Bbb i Y) = g(U,V) + g(V,Y) + \Bbb i \big( g(V,X) - g(U,Y) \big)$ then the right-hand side of the definition of the gradient is $\Bbb C$-linear in both $f$ and $X$, while the right-hand side is sesqui-linear, so this would be a mistake. Is $\nabla$ conjugate-linear? This would shock me.

Therefore, when I read things like $\int f \Delta h \Bbb \; d x = - \int g (\nabla f, \nabla h) \; \Bbb d x$, is this valid only for real-valued functions?

However, the above criteria cannot distinguish between, say, a Mobius strip with 1 half-twist and a Mobius strip with 3 half-twists; it can only tell us if the number of twists is even or odd. Can we tell how many half-twists a strip has in a purely topological way that avoids the embedding of the strip in $\mathbb{R}^3$?  The more I think about it, the less convinced I am that we can.

$$B-\bigcup_{A\in F} A=\bigcap_{A\in F}(B-A)\qquad\text{ and }\qquad B-\bigcap_{A\in F} A=\bigcup_{A\in F}(B-A)$$
so I thought that rather than repeating the problem just with $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ switched, why not create the notation of a circle with one half filled in to be like $\pm$ for the big cup and cap? In other words, see the attached image. The motivation for using this particular symbol should be clear because the one with a the bottom half colored black leaves only a semicircle at the top which is kinda $\bigcap$, and similarly the one with the top half colored black leaves a semicircular segment at the bottom which looks like $\bigcup$. But of course I do not mean to say that the one with the top colored black should denote $\bigcup$, nor that the one with the bottom colored black should denote $\bigcap$; rather, I am just using the symbols in the same way as say $\pm$ and $\mp$ are used in
$$\tan(a\pm b)=\frac{\tan a\pm \tan b}{1\mp \tan a\tan b},$$
to write two formulas in one. I hope this makes sense, please tell me what you think. Or maybe there is already a convention for this, in which case I would like to hear about it. Thanks!","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"
1379353,Intersection of Random Subspace and Hypercube,"Suppose that $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a random linear subspace of dimension $k < n$.  I am interested in the event that $A$ intersects the hypercube $[-1,\ 1]^n$ at a specific face. In other words, the event that there is some vector $a\in A$ with particular configuration of $r$ entries equal to $1$ and $s$ entries equal to $-1$ (the remaining entries are all in the range $(-1, 1)$) with $r+s\leq k$. In particular, I am interested in calculating or bounding the probability of such an event. The distribution of $A$ can be chosen as any continuous distribution that makes this tractable/easy. I would appreciate any pointers on this as I'm unsure where to start.

1379363,Why formulate continuity in terms of pre-images instead of image?,"I wanted to discuss my intuition of why we formulate the concept of continuity in terms of pre-image of open set is open instead of images for example if we consider $f(x) = c$ where $c$ is some constant, then that should be continuous, but if we formulated continuity in terms of images it won't be continuous. Is the reason we do it that way, because pre-images will always guarantee that function in the domain can only have $1$ value?","['continuity', 'general-topology']"
1379369,"If $N$ is the boundary of Riemannian $M$, can I compute $i^{*}(* (\alpha \wedge \beta))$?","There wasn't enough room in the title to explain completely: $M$ is an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary $N$. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are differential forms on $M$, $*$ denotes the Hodge star, and $i:N \hookrightarrow M$ is the inclusion. Now, if I know $i^{*}\alpha$ and $i^{*}(* \alpha)$, that should be enough to uniquely reconstruct $\alpha$ on $N$. So there is hope that there is a formula for $i^{*}(*(\alpha \wedge \beta))$ in terms of $i^{*}(\alpha)$, $i^{*}(\beta)$, $i^{*}(*\alpha)$, $i^{*}(*\beta)$, and the wedge product/exterior derivative/hodge star on $N$. Is there? My motivation is, given a connection $A$ on $M$ for a trivial $G$ bundle, trying to reconstruct $i^{*}(F_A)$ using only data that depends linearly on $A$ (this is a $\mathfrak{g}-$valued one-form but similar logic should hold).","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"
1379370,Maximum number of commutators required to generate an element of the derived subgroup,"Let $G$ be a group for which the center $Z(G)$ is of index $n$ . How to prove that an element of the derived subgroup $G^\prime$ is the product of at most $n^3$ commutators? This exercise is from a French algebra book of the 70s. It follows another exercise asking to prove that if $G$ is a group whose center $Z(G)$ is of index $n$ , then for any elements $x,y \in G$ $$[x,y]^{n+1}=[x,y^2][yxy^{-1},y]^{n-1}$$",['group-theory']
1379377,Limit behavior of a definite integral that depends on a parameter.,"Let $A>0$ and $0\le  \mu \le 2$. Consider a following integral.
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal I}(A,\mu) := \int\limits_0^\infty e^{-(k A)^\mu} \cdot \frac{\cos(k)-1}{k} dk
\end{equation}
By substituting for $k A$ and then by expanding the cosine in a Taylor series about zero I  have shown that:
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal I}(A,\mu) = \frac{1}{\mu} \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(1/A)^n}{n!} \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} n\right) \cdot \Gamma\left(\frac{n}{\mu}\right)

1379407,Showing that a Borel Measure $\mu\equiv 0$,"Problem. Let $\mu$ be a Borel measure on $[0,1]$. Assume that $\mu$ and Lebesgue measure $m$ are mutually singular. $\mu([0,t])$ depends continuously on $t$. $f\in L^{1}(\mu)$ for any function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, with $f\in L^{1}(m)$. (Note that $f$ has a finite value at every point.) Show that $\mu\equiv 0$. This question was asked before, but it did not receive a full answer--just a commented suggestion on how to proceed. My issue is that I don't see why $\mu=\delta_{0}$ (i.e. the Dirac mass at $x=0$) is not a counterexample to the problem statement. $\delta_{0}$ and Lebesgue measure are mutually singular. $\mu([0,t])\equiv 1$, which is trivially continuous. And for any function $f$ satisfying 3. $\int f\mathrm{d}\mu=f(0)$, which is finite by hypothesis. Am I missing something obvious? I believe I can show that under the hypotheses of the problem, we must have $\mu(\left\{0\right\})=\mu([0,1])$. Indeed, suppose that $\mu(\left\{0\right\})<\mu([0,1])$. Since $\mu$ and $m$ are mutually singular, there exist disjoint measure sets $A,B$ with $A\cup B=[0,1]$, $m(A)=0$, and $\mu(B)=0$. Since $F(t):=\mu([0,t])$ is continuous, the intermediate value theorem (IVT) applies. By repeated application of IVT, we can inductively find an increasing sequence $\left\{t_{n}\right\}$ with $$t_{0}:=0, \quad \alpha_{n+1}:=\mu([0,t_{n+1}])>\alpha_{n}:=\mu([0,t_{n}])$$
Note that it follows from the continuity of $F$ that $\mu(\left\{t\right\})=0$ for any $0<t\leq 1$. In particular, $\mu([t_{n},t_{n+1}))=\alpha_{n+1}-\alpha_{n}$. Now define a Borel measurable function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by $$f(s):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{n+1}-\alpha_{n}}\chi_{A\cap [t_{n},t_{n+1})}(s)$$ $f\in L^{1}(m)$, since $m(A)=0$, so $f\in L^{1}(\mu)$ by problem assumption. But then for any positive integer $N$, $$\int f(s)\mathrm{d}\mu(s)\geq\sum_{n=0}^{N}\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{n+1}-\alpha_{n}}\mu(A\cap [t_{n},t_{n+1}))=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{n+1}-\alpha_{n}}\mu([t_{n},t_{n+1}))=\sum_{n=0}^{N}1=N$$ Whence, we arrive at a contradiction.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

I think it is, but I put on this question to make sure.

I know that to do this, I must use triple integration. Thus far, I know that we need to reevaluate the given equations and put them into spherical coordinates in order to achieve our bounds. When we've gotten our bounds, it's just simple triple integration to computer the volume. So, for our sphere, I said that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2$ is equivalent to $\rho = sqrt(2)$. Then, for our sphere, I get a little messed up. I'm trying to find $\phi$ boundaries here, but I get the equation $\rho^2sin^2\phi = \rho cos\phi$ Then, the $\rho$ can cancel out, making it $\rho sin^2\phi = cos\phi$, but my issue is that the $\rho$ doesn't cancel out completely so I can't get the bounds for $\phi$.
