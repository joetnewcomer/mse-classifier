150708,"Finding points relating to the edge of a circle in an x,y coordinate system","My question is a bit hard for me to express, so please bear with me. I never got far in trig, and haven't done much on the subject in years; trying to get back into it as it's a pretty major part of physics and I'm starting game development as a hobby. Basically, I want to draw a pattern in the centre of a screen. That pattern will consist of a random amount of lines, all the same random length. These lines will all originate from one centre point, and will all be evenly spaced. I'm working with a grid of pixels. Anyone familiar with graphical programming will know that most pixel grids start with the top left 0,0 in an x,y co-ordinate system. There are no negative points. Say my grid is 500x500. The centre pixel will be located at 250,250. 0,0 is the top-left pixel, 500,500 is the bottom right. All measurements in this question are in pixels. Now say that this centre pixel, 250,250, is the exact centre of a circle. From now on let's call this centre point xy . The radius of the circle is r (assume it fits inside the grid). There is another variable in play. Let's call it a . a is the amount of lines I want drawn from the centre of the circle to the edge of the circle, all evenly spaced (so r is the length of each line). I'm assuming that in order to do this, I have to do this: 360 / a , which gives me a degree (I'm totally making these variable names up) which I will somehow use to evenly space the lines. This leads to the question! Given xy , r & a , how can I go about getting the x & y co-ordinates of the lines' end-points? I hope this is clear enough! Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.","['trigonometry', 'circles', 'random', 'coordinate-systems']"
150710,"For a reflexive Banach space, we have $\left\Vert x-y\right\Vert =\left\Vert x+F\right\Vert _{E/F}$","The problem is: Let E be a Banach space and $F\subset E$ be a closed linear subspace.
Prove that for every $x \in E$ there exists $y \in F$ such that $\left\Vert x-y\right\Vert =\inf\left\{ \left\Vert x-z\right\Vert :\, z\in F\right\} =\left\Vert x+F\right\Vert _{E/F}$ . My efforts: By definition, we know that $\left\Vert x+F\right\Vert _{E/F}:=\inf\left\{ \left\Vert x+z\right\Vert :\, z\in F\right\} $ , and since $F$ is a linear subspace, we have that $\inf\left\{ \left\Vert x+z\right\Vert :\, z\in F\right\} =\inf\left\{ \left\Vert x-z\right\Vert :\, z\in F\right\} $ . My idea: We know that for every bounded sequence in a reflexive Banach space, there exists a weakly convergent subsequence. My question: How can I now use the weak convergence to prove the first equality of my statement?

150730,Non-vanishing differential form: what does it mean?,"A $1$-form $\alpha$ over a smooth manifold is non vanishing if for every $p\in M$, $\alpha_p\neq 0$. But $\alpha_p$ is a linear map $T_p M\to \mathbb R$ hence $\alpha_p(0)=0$.  So confusion arises and the precise question is: What does non vanishing mean for differential forms?

150738,Ex${{{}}}$tremely Tricky Probability Question?,"Here's the question. It's quite difficult: David is given a deck of 40 cards. There are 3 gold cards in the deck, 3 silver cards in the deck, 3 bronze cards in the deck and 3 black cards in the deck. If David draws the gold card on his first turn, he will win $50. (The object is to get at least one gold card). The other colored cards are used to help him get the gold card, while the remaining 28 do nothing. David initially draws a hand of 6 cards, and will now try to draw a gold card, if he did not already already draw one. He may now use the other cards to help him. All of the differently colored cards may be used in the first turn. David can use a silver card to draw 1 more card. David can use a bronze card to draw 1 more card. However, he can only use 1 of these per turn. David can use a black card to look at the top 3 cards of the deck, and add one of them to his hand. He then sends the rest back to the deck and shuffles. He can only use 1 of these cards per turn. What are the odds David draws the gold card on his first turn?","['algebra-precalculus', 'probability']"

150744,Generating Elements of Galois Group,"I am trying to prove the following: Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\sqrt{p_n})$. Show that $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with Galois group $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$. I have attached my proof below not as a means of verifying it, only as a means of making my question as clear as possible. My question is: Is it correct to say that that $\tau_i$'s generate $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$, and therefore that we can decompose elements of $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ into compositions of these functions. My proof is as follows: To show $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois we need to show it is the splitting field of a separable polynomial. The field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\sqrt{p_n})$ is obtained by an $n$ step process where step $i$ consists of adjoining $\sqrt{p_i}$ to the field $Q_{i-1}=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\sqrt{p_{i-1}})$ and $Q_0$ is defined to be $\mathbb{Q}$. This gives the following tower of extensions $$\mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1})\subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1},\sqrt{p_2})\subset \cdots\subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\sqrt{p_n}).$$ Note that $Q_i\neq Q_{i+1}$, because $\sqrt{p_{i+1}} \not \in Q_{i}$ for all $i$; the fact the $\sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\sqrt{p_n}$ are distinct primes insures this. Since none of the $p_j$ are squares (because they are prime) we know $\sqrt{p_j} \not \in \mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, the distinctness of the $p_j$ insure that $\sqrt{p_i} \neq \sqrt{p_j}$ for all $i \neq j$. The minimal polynomial of the extension $Q_{i+1}/Q_i$ is $f_{i+1}(X)=X^2-p_{i+1}$, which is separable with roots $\pm\sqrt{p_{i+1}}$. From this we see that the polynomial we are concerned with is $$f(X)=f_1(X)\cdots f_n(X)=(X^2-p_1)\cdots(X^2-p_n),$$ also a separable polynomial. $K$ is a splitting field for this separable polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. From the tower of fields above we see they $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=2^n$, since the degree of each $Q_i/Q_{i-1}$ is 2. From this we can deduce that $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})=2^n$. As with before, $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by its action on the roots of $f(X)$, which are $$\{\pm \sqrt{p_1},\ldots,\pm \sqrt{p_n}\},$$ or, more correctly, on the roots of the minimal polynomial of each of these roots. Consider the map
\begin{equation*}
    \tau_{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)}= \begin{cases}
      \sqrt{p_1}& \mapsto \pm \sqrt{p_1},\\
      \sqrt{p_2}& \mapsto \pm \sqrt{p_2},\\
	& \vdots\\
      \sqrt{p_n}& \mapsto \pm \sqrt{p_n},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $a_i\in \{0,1\}$ and $a_i=0$ means $\sqrt{p_i} \mapsto \sqrt{p_i}$ and $a_i=1$ means $\sqrt{p_i} \mapsto \sqrt{p_i}$. 
This gives $2n$ possible maps which take roots of the $f_i(X)$ to roots of $f_i(X)$ (note that these are all such maps as well). Since $|\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})|=2^n$ all of these maps must be automorphisms of $K$. What remains to be seen is that $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q}) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$. We can decompose $\tau_{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)}$ into a composition of the maps $\tau_i:K\rightarrow K$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
\tau_i = \begin{cases}
\tau_i\left(\sqrt{p_j}\right) = -\sqrt{p_i} & \text{for } i=j,\\
\tau_i\left(\sqrt{p_j}\right) = \sqrt{p_j} & \text{for } i\neq j,
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $\tau_{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)}=\tau_1^{a_1}\circ \cdots \circ \tau_n^{a_n}$. We see that every element of $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ can be obtained through the composition of $\tau_i$'s and therefore $\{\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\}$ generates $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$. Let $\tau \in \operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\tau_1^{a_1}\circ \cdots \circ \tau_n^{a_n}$. Define the map $\chi: \operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}^n$ by first defining the action of $\chi$ on each $\tau_i$ by $$\chi(\tau_i) \mapsto \tau_i(\sqrt{p_i})/\sqrt{p_i},$$ and then defining 
\begin{align*}
\chi(\tau)&=\chi(\tau_1^{a_1}\circ \cdots \circ \tau_n^{a_n})\\
&=(\chi(\tau_1^{a_1}),\ldots,\chi(\tau_n^{a_n})).
\end{align*}
Once we show this map is injective we are done, as any injective map between finite sets of the same cardinality is surjective. Assume $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$. Then clearly $\tau_1^{a_1}\circ \cdots\circ \tau_n^{a_n}=\tau_1^{b_1}\circ \cdots \circ \tau_n^{b_n}$, since $a_i=b_i$ for all $i$. Now, $\{\pm 1\}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, as the map $\varphi: \{\pm 1\} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ by $\varphi(-1)=1$ and $\varphi(1)=0$ is an injective homormorphism. Therefore $$\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})\cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n.$$ Attempted proof of Martin Brandenburg's Claim: Claim: For all $i<n$ and $i<k_1<\ldots<k_s\leq n$, $\sqrt{p_{k_1}\ldots p_{k_s}} \not \in Q_i$. Proceed by induction on $n$. If $i=0$, then we must show that $\sqrt{p_{k_1}\ldots p_{k_s}} \not \in \mathbb{Q}$, where $0<k_1<\ldots<k_s\leq n$. This is equivalent to showing that $p_{k_1}\ldots p_{k_s}$ is not a square, which is clear since $p_{k_1}, \ldots ,p_{k_s}$ are prime numbers. Assume the result is true for all $i<n-1$ and consider $i=n-1$. We need to show $\sqrt{p_n}\not \in Q_{n-1}$. Assume the contrary, that $\sqrt{p_n} \in Q_{n-1}$. Then $$\sqrt{p_n}=\sum_{(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})} a_{(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})} \sqrt{{p_1}^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_{n-1}^{\alpha_{n-1}}}, \quad \dagger$$ where $\alpha_i \in \{0,1\}$ and $a_{(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})}\in \mathbb{Q}$. Multiplying both sides of $(\dagger)$ by $\sqrt{p_n}$ gives $$p_n=\sum_{(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})} a_{(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_{n-1})} \sqrt{{p_1}^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_{n-1}^{\alpha_{n-1}}p_n},$$ contradicting the fact $\sqrt{{p_1}^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_{n-1}^{\alpha_{n-1}}p_n} \not \in \mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\sqrt{p_n} \not \in Q_{n-1}$.","['galois-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

So I started by taking $\int\limits^1_0 \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x}}\, \text{d}x$, and then doing substitution: $\left[u = 1+\frac{1}{x}, \text{d}u = \frac{-1}{x^2}\text{d}x \Rightarrow -\text{d}u = \frac{1}{x^2}\text{d}x \right]^1_0 = -\int\limits^1_0 \sqrt{u} \,\text{d}u$ but this obviously will not lead to the correct answer, since $\frac{1}{x^2}$ isn't in the original formula.

150751,Contractible vs. Deformation retract to a point. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why doesn't the ""zig-zag"" comb deformation retract onto a point, even though it's contractible? (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I have a quick question about the difference between the two concepts in the title. 
The question is basically ex.6 (b) in Hatcher's book titled ""Algebraic Topology"".
Let $X$ be the subspace of $R^2$ consisting of the horizontal segment $[0,1] \times \{0\}$ together with the vertical segments $\{r\} \times  [0,1-r]$ for $r$ a rational number in $[0,1]$. Now let $Y$ be the space that is the union of an infinite number of copies of $X$ arranged in a zig zag formation. See below - Now my question is why can't one deformation retract $Y$ to a point in the darkened zig zag line? Surely the darkened zig zag line is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, which is deformation retractable to a point, and each of the vertical lines of each copy of $X$ deformation retracts to its segment of the zig zag line! I must be missing something here as one has to prove that $Y$ does not deformation retract to any point!","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
150769,"Refraction equation, quartic equation","Given two points $P$ and $Q$, a line ($A$, $B$ - orthogonal projection of $P$, $Q$ onto the line) and a coefficient $n$, I want to find out such point $C$ that $\frac{\sin{a}}{\sin{b}}=n$ (in fact, it's an equation of light refraction). I also assume that $C$ lies between $A$ and $B$. See the image below: What I know is: $w, h, d, n$. What I want to calculate is $x$. I need to find the easiest solution possible, in order to calculate $x$ in a computer's application very efficiently. What I've found out so far is: $$n=\frac{\sin{a}}{\sin{b}}=\frac{\frac{d-x}{\sqrt{(d-x)^2+w^2}}}{\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+h^2}}}=\frac{(d-x)\sqrt{x^2+h^2}}{x\sqrt{(d-x)^2+w^2}}$$ Hence, we need to solve this equation for $x$ (assuming $0<x<d$): $n^2x^2((d-x)^2+w^2)=(d-x)^2(x^2+h^2)$ which yields: $f(x)=(n^2-1)x^4-2d(n^2-1)x^3+((d^2+w^2)(n^2-1)+w^2-h^2)x^2+2dh^2x-d^2h^2 = 0$ That way we obtained a quartic equation. How to solve it? I've tried using the Ferrari's solution, but the result is very complicated. Moreover, this equation can have as many as four real roots but I know it's got only one root for $0<x<d$. Do you have any idea how to simplify this equation or maybe you can suggest me an easier way to find $x$?","['geometry', 'polynomials', 'trigonometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'numerical-methods']"
150780,Expected value of Stock Price,"Someone plans to use x dollars buying some stock share, the stock price is $a$ dollars per share now. One year later, the stock price will possibly increase to $ra$ or decrease to $a/r$ (r>1) which the probability is $p$, or remain the price now which probability is $1-2p$. If he want to own more shares, should he buy the stock share or one year later? Solution I: The expected value of the share price one year later is $a(rp+\frac{p}{r}+1-2p)$. So one year later he can buy $\frac{x}{a(rp+\frac{p}{r}+1-2p)}<\frac{x}{a}$. So buy the stock share now. Solution II: One year later, if price is $ra$, he can buy $\frac{x}{ra}$ shares; if price is $\frac{a}{r}$, he can buy $\frac{xr}{a}$ shares. Then the expected value of the shares he can buy one year later is
$$\frac{x}{ra}*p+\frac{xr}{a}*p+\frac{x}{a}*(1-2p)>\frac{x}{a}$$. So buy the stock one year later. What's wrong with Solution II.",['probability']

150840,How does one calculate genus of an algebraic curve?,"I've been reading about parametrization of algebraic curves recently and the idea of the ""genus of a curve"" appears quite often (my impression is that a curve is parametrizable exactly when it has genus 0), but I can't seem to find a definition for it, much less an intuitive idea of what this means. I'd appreciate if anyone could explain what the genus of an algebraic curve is. More specifically, papers often say something like this (where $\mathcal{C}$ is our curve): $\mathcal{C}$ has singularities at $P_1=(1:0:0),P_2=(0:1:0),P_3=(0:0:1),P_4=(1:1:1)$ , where $P_1,P_2,P_3$ are 5-fold points and $P_4$ is a 4-fold point. So the genus of $\mathcal{C}$ is 0. [For reference, $\mathcal{C}$ is a curve of degree 10 in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ .] $\mathcal{C}$ has a triple point $P_1$ at the origin $(0,0)$ , and double points $P_2=(0,1), P_3=(1,1)$ , $P_4=(1,0)$ . So the genus of $\mathcal{C}$ is 0. [ $\mathcal{C}$ is a curve of degree 5 in $\mathbb{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$ .] I don't understand how to make the leap from singular points to genus in these examples.

150849,Mean Square Equality of Random Processes,"It is given in Papoulis that: Two random processes X (t) and Y (t) are equal in the MS sense iff \begin{equation}
E{|\mathbf X(t)-\mathbf Y(t)|^2} = 0
\end{equation} for every t. It follows that \begin{equation}
\mathbf X(t, \xi) = \mathbf Y(t,\xi)
\end{equation} with probability 1 where $\xi$ is an outcome. I have two questions here: 1) What do you mean by two random processes are equal with probability 1 and how is it different from two random processes are equal i.e, X (t, $\xi$ ) = Y (t, $\xi$ ), $\forall\xi$ ? 2) How does the first equation imply the second? The exact text given in the book: Two processes X (t) and Y (t) are equal in MS sense iff $$
E{|\mathbf X(t)-\mathbf Y(t)|^2} = 0
$$ for every t. Equality in the MS sense leads to the following conclusion: We denote by $A_t$ the set of outcomes $\xi$ such that $\mathbf X(t,\xi)=\mathbf Y(t,\xi)$ for a specific t, and by $A_\infty$ the set of outcomes $\xi$ such that $\mathbf X(t,\xi)=\mathbf Y(t,\xi)$ for every t. From the above equation it follows that $\mathbf X(t,\xi)-\mathbf Y(t,\xi) = 0$ with probability 1; hence $P(A_t)=P(S)=1$ . It does not follow, however, that $P(A_\infty)=1$ . In fact, since $A_\infty$ is the intersection of all sets $A_t$ as t ranges over the entire axis, $P(A_\infty)$ might even equal 0. I'm facing difficulty in understanding/visualizing the above. Thank you very much for the reply for the previous questions which helped me understanding half way. Can you give me an example for the following which I hope will help me understand the above conclusion.

150872,What is the meaning of evaluating the divergence at a _point_?,"Reading this first, Divergence (div) is “flux density”—the amount of flux entering or leaving a point. Think of it as the rate of flux expansion (positive divergence) or flux contraction (negative divergence). If you measure flux in bananas (and c’mon, who doesn’t?), a positive divergence means your location is a source of bananas. You’ve hit the Donkey Kong jackpot. Wikipedia has: In physical terms, the divergence of a three dimensional vector field is the extent to which the vector field flow behaves like a source or a sink at a given point. It is a local measure of its ""outgoingness""—the extent to which there is more exiting an infinitesimal region of space than entering it. What puzzles me is, what's the direction ?  Doesn't divergence need a direction too? For example, say you have this 2d vector field $$
F(x,y) = (x,y)
$$ This field is everywhere ""spreading"" from the origin: The divergence is: $$
\nabla \cdot (x,y) = 2
$$ Ie everywhere positive.  Everywhere is a ""source"".  At every point, if you draw an infinitesimally small circle, as the Wikipedia definition has, no matter how small it is, that circle will see more ""stuff"" leaving it than entering it -- ie everywhere is a source. But that only makes sense if you are talking as measured using a vector from the origin .  But nowhere in the definitions of divergence do I see this last bolded comment mentioned, making me uneasy. Take a vector field with values in the opposite direction: $$
F(x,y) = (-x,-y)
$$ The divergence everywhere is $$
\nabla \cdot (-x,-y) = -2
$$ Ie everywhere negative.  Everywhere is a ""sink"".  Ie the field ""slows down"" at every point. If you are talking about every point, and the direction of flow is actually towards the origin .  Then and only then, is the function everywhere ""slowing down"". So like, what exactly is the divergence at a point?  Does it really make sense?  Am I right about having to consider the direction as towards the origin in order for the ""sources/sinks"" idea to make sense?  Where is this stated?","['multivariable-calculus', 'terminology']"

150923,Prove that the Lipschitz constant cannot be less than $1$,"I was asked to study the following map: let $I=[0,1]$ and let $f(s)=\log(1+s^2)$ for any $s\in\mathbb R$. For every $u\in L^1(I,\mathbb R)$ we set $$(F(u))(x)=\int_0^xf(u(t))\mathrm d t.$$ First of all I had shown that $F$ maps $L^1(I,\mathbb R)$ into itself. Then the second point was to show that $F$ is Lipschitz continuous from $L^1(I,\mathbb R)$ into itself with Lipschitz constant less than or equal than $1$, and I've done that. Finally the problem asked to show that the Lipschitz constant couldn't be less than $1$. My first approach was to use the Caccioppoli Banach lemma to derive a sort of a contradiction. However if you study the integral equation $$\begin{cases}u(x)=\int_0^x\log(1+u(t)^2)\mathrm d t\\ u(0)=0,\end{cases}$$ then by unicity of the solution one sees that $u\equiv 0$ is the only fixed point... if I am not mistaken. Then i tried to find a sequence of function $u_\lambda\in L^1(I,\mathbb R)$, with $\lambda<1$ such that, $\|Fu_\lambda\|_{L^1}>\lambda\|u_\lambda\|_{L^1}$, but i had no success.

Let $X=\operatorname{Spec} A$ , $Y=\operatorname{Spec} B$ where $A,B$ commutative rings. Then I wonder to know Does there exist a canonical choice of a ring $C$ such that $\operatorname{Spec} C$ is cannonically isomorphic to the Cartesian topology of $X\times Y$ ?

So by Fact 1 , the product topology of $X\times Y$ is a spectral space , thus it can be realized as a spectrum of a commutative ring (see the same wiki article). Moreover, if we are considering the product topology $X\times_Z Y$ (the induced topology of the product topology $X\times Y$ ), where $X,Y,Z$ are affine schemes the maps $X\to Z$ , $Y\to Z$ are induced by the ring maps, what will happen in this case, is $X\times_Z Y$ a spectral space, etc?

151032,"If $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is such that $f (x + y) = f (x) f (y)$ and continuous at $0$, then continuous everywhere","Prove that if $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is such that $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for all $x,y$, and $f$ is continuous at $0$, then it is continuous everywhere. If there exists $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c) = 0$, then
$$f(x + c) = f(x)f(c) = 0.$$
As every real number $y$ can be written as $y = x + c$ for some real $x$, this function is either everywhere zero or nowhere zero. The latter case is the interesting one. So let's consider the case that $f$ is not the constant function $f = 0$. To prove continuity in this case, note that for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$
$$f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x)f(0) \implies f(0) = 1.$$ Continuity at $0$ tells us that given any $\varepsilon_0 > 0$, we can find $\delta_0 > 0$ such that $|x| < \delta_0$ implies
$$|f(x) - 1| < \varepsilon_0.$$ Okay, so let $c \in \mathbb{R}$ be fixed arbitrarily (recall that $f(c)$ is nonzero). Let $\varepsilon > 0$. By continuity of $f$ at $0$, we can choose $\delta > 0$ such that
$$|x - c| < \delta\implies |f(x - c) - 1| < \frac{\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}.$$ Now notice that for all $x$ such that $|x - c| < \delta$, we have
$$\begin{align*}
|f(x) - f(c)| &= |f(x - c + c) - f(c)|\\
 &= |f(x - c)f(c) - f(c)|\\
 &= |f(c)| |f(x - c) - 1|\\
 &\lt |f(c)| \frac{\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}\\ 
 &= \varepsilon.

Hence $f$ is continuous at $c$. Since $c$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continuous on all of $\mathbb{R}$. Is my procedure correct?","['functional-equations', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

I'm trying to find a closed form solution for the problem (notice that $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ is the number of arrangements of $j$ horses and $k$ students in which the last horse is empty and the adjacent $l$ horses are not all occupied). Here I want to show an algebraic way, to obtain $f_{j,k}^{(l)} = [j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k), \qquad j=l$ which I got through combinatorial interpretation, that I think helpful to solve the recurrence of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$. In fact, $[j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k)$ is the solution to the following recurrence: \begin{align*}
g_{1,k} &= \left[k \le 1\right] (1 - k), \qquad k \ge 0 \\
g_{j,k} &= \left[k < j\right] \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0
\end{align*} Notice that the recurrence of $g$ is similiar with that of $f^{(l)}$. It seems to be as strange as the recurrence of $f^{(l)}$, but it isn't too messy. Let's solve it by hand. First assume that \begin{align*}
g_{1,k}^* &= 1 - k, \qquad k \ge 0 \\
g_{j,k}^* &= \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0
\end{align*} We have $g_{1,k}^* = g_{1,k}$ for $0 \le k \le 1$. Now let's consider the exponential generating function for $g_{j,k}^*$: $\hat G_j^*(z) = \sum_{k \ge 0} g_{j,k}^* z^k/k!$.
\begin{align*}
\hat G_1^*(z)
&= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(1-k)z^k}{k!} \\
&= \sum_{k \ge 0} \left(\frac{z^k}{k!} - \frac{kz^k}{k!}\right) \\
&= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^k}{k!} - \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^{k+1}}{k!} \\
&= (1-z)e^z
\end{align*}
and for $j > 1$,
\begin{align*}
\hat G_j^*(z)
&= \sum_{k \ge 0} \sum_{0 \le t \le k} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^k}{t!(k-t)!} \\
&= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge t} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^{k-t}}{(k-t)!} \\
&= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{g_{j-1,k}^*z^k}{k!} \\
&= e^z \hat G_{j-1}^*(z)
\end{align*}
so $\hat G_j^*(z) = (1-z)e^{jz}$, and we get $g_{j,k}^* = j^{k-1}(j-k)$, and $g_{k,k}^* = g_{k,k} = 0$ whenever $k \ge 1$. Now it's easy to prove $g_{j,k} = g_{j,k}^*$ for $0 \le k \le j$ by induction on $j$. Can we solve $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ like this? More precisely, extend some zeros of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ to nonzeros to eliminate the awful factor $[j > k + 1]$ in recurrence, solve it and prove that the nonzeros of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ keeps its value when extending?

151243,Non-abelian $p$-group; abelian subgroups of index $p$,"I'm trying to prove the following problem: (a) Let $G$ be a non-abelian $p$-group with an abelian subgroup of index $p$. Then the number of abelian subgroups of $G$ of index $p$ is either $1$ or $p+1$; in the latter case the center of $G$ has index $p^2$. (b) A nilpotent group of class $3$ and order $16$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup of index $2$. I've made some progress towards (a) and tried to use (a) to show (b). But despite thinking about this for a few days I'm missing something and I can't quite finish off my argument. Here is an outline of the main results that I have managed to show; essentially, I think I've shown that for part (a), if there is more than one than there must be at least $p+1$. Assume that there is more than one abelian subgroup of index $p$. Let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. Then they are both maximal and hence normal in $G$, and then $G=HK$. Then I was able to show that $H \cap K \leq Z(G)$, and then it follows that $Z(G)$ has index $p^2$ (as $G$ is non-abelian). So now I want to show that there are exactly $p+1$ abelian subgroups of index $p$. Suppose $L$ is a subgroup of $G$ of index $p$ containing $H \cap K$. Then $L \lhd G$. Since $H \cap K \lhd G$ and it has index $p^2$, then $L/(H \cap K)$ is cyclic of order $p$. From this I was able to show that $L$ is abelian. Now consider $G/(H \cap K)$, which has order $p^2$; however it can't be cyclic since it has two subgroups of order $p$, namely $H/(H \cap K)$ and $K/(H \cap K)$.

151258,Very special rational points on curves over number fields,"For some reason, I'm convinced  the answer to the following question should be (obviously) negative, but I can't come up with a good reason. Does there exist a number field $K$, a smooth projective geometrically connected curve $X/K$ of genus $g\geq 2$ with a $K$-rational point $x$ such that, for any number field $L/K$, $x$ does not intersect $ X(L)$? Let me make the last part of the question more precise. Firstly, let $\mathcal X$ be the minimal regular model of  $X$ over $O_K$. When I say that $x$ does not intersect $X(L)$ I mean that the intersection product  $(x,y)_{\mathcal X}$ on $\mathcal X$ equals zero for all $y\in X(L)-\{x\}$. (Here $x$ and $y$ also denote their Zariski closures in $\mathcal X$.) I think it could happen that some $K$-rational point does not intersect any other $K$-rational point.

Now $f|_{U_x\cap W_a}$ is a homemorphism, so in particular I know that  $\psi_{\alpha}f\chi_a^{-1}$ and $\psi_{\alpha}f\phi_x^{-1}$ are holomorphic and invertible.

151336,$\frac{dx}{dt}=-\lambda x +\epsilon x(t-a)$ series solution via Laplace method,"Consider the following equation
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=-\lambda x +\epsilon x(t-a), \quad x(0)=1,\quad |\epsilon|\ll1$$
where $a$ and $\lambda$ are positive constants and $x(t-a)$ means the function $x(t)$ evaluated at $t-a$.
The task is to obtain a solution as a series in powers of $\epsilon$. The book suggests to show that $x(t)=e^{-\lambda t} w(t)$ satisfies
$$\frac{dw}{dt}=\delta w(t-a)\quad w(0)=1,\quad \delta=\epsilon e^{\lambda a}$$
and show that the perturbation expansion is given by the following expression:
$$w(t)=1+t\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\delta^n}{n!}\left(t-na\right)^{n-1}$$
hence
$$x(t)=e^{-\lambda t}\left(1+t\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\delta^n}{n!}\left(t-na\right)^{n-1}\right)$$
Since the method given in the solution is basically verification by substitution and proof by induction, I have been looking for a more systematic approach.
The presence of time delay in RHS suggests that Laplace transform method could be appropriate here. So I proceed as follows.
Apply Laplace transform to both sides of the original equation observing the initial conditions:
$$x(t)\fallingdotseq X(s)$$
$$sX(s)-x(0)=-\lambda X(s) +\epsilon e^{-sa}X(s)$$
Solve for $X(s)$:
$$X(s)=\frac{x(0)}{s+\lambda-\epsilon e^{-sa}}=\frac{1}{s+\lambda-\epsilon e^{-sa}}$$
Expand in powers of $\epsilon$:
$$X(s)=\frac{1}{s+\lambda}\left(\frac{1}{1-\epsilon\frac{e^{-sa}}{s+\lambda}}\right)=\frac{1}{s+\lambda}\left(1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\epsilon^n e^{-nas}}{(s+\lambda)^n}\right)=\frac{1}{s+\lambda}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\epsilon^n e^{-nas}}{(s+\lambda)^{n+1}}$$
Taking inverse transforms
$$\frac{1}{s+\lambda} \risingdotseq e^{-\lambda t}$$
$$\frac{e^{-nas}}{(s+\lambda)^{n+1}} \risingdotseq \frac{(t-na)^n e^{-\lambda(t-na)}}{n!}$$
But then I lose the factor of $t$ before the sum as compared to the book solution. Where am I making the slip?

151344,A seeming paradox in a coin-flipping game,"This is related to my other question on a similar topic. Suppose we play the following game: we flip a coin repeatedly and record the outcomes.  For example we might get HHTTTHTTHHTTT... .  Now Alice and Bob each choose distinct patterns of the same length, called $A$ and $B$, respectively.  Which ever player's pattern appears first wins the game. Now suppose Alice chooses $A=$ HHHH and Bob chooses $B=$ HHHT .  First, let's notice that the expected number of flips to obtain $A$ is 30, but for $B$ it's only 16.  This would seem to imply that Bob is very likely to win this game most of the time. However, thinking about the game in another way, neither Alice nor Bob can win until HHH occurs.  And after this, the game ends on the next flip with each player winning equiprobably.

151350,"Is it true that every positive integer is the sum of 18 fourth powers of integers? (No, but i don't understand given answer)","My question is actual at the bottom in bold and is about the logic the author uses. Is it true that every positive integer is the sum of 18 fourth powers of integers? This is a question form a discrete math book, not to worry the answer is detailed in the book as well: Solution: To determine whether a positive integer n can be written as the sum of 18 fourth powers
of integers, we might begin by examining whether n is the sum of 18 fourth powers of integers
for the smallest positive integers. Because the fourth powers of integers are 0, 1, 16, 81, . . . ,
if we can select 18 terms from these numbers that add up to n, then n is the sum of 18 fourth
powers. We can show that all positive integers up to 78 can be written as the sum of 18 fourth
powers. (The details are left to the reader.) However, if we decided this was enough checking,
we would come to the wrong conclusion. It is not true that every positive integer is the sum of
18 fourth powers because 79 is not the sum of 18 fourth powers (as the reader can verify). my question is about the authors logic. He specifically says that the fourth powers are 0, 1, 16, 81. i presume because 0^4, 1^4, 2^4... so my reasoning says that i'm to select 18 terms [out of a set [0,1,16,81...]
and i should be able to create any number with them I choose to try to create the number 3 so [0,1,16... eh] well 1 is less then 3, but after that i can't draw anymore because i'll go over 3. so the proof is false (which the author confirms) BUT the author says ""

powers. (The details are left to the reader.)"" apparently he shouldn't have left them up to me because I'm not getting it. So how did he say produce 3 out of 18 fourth powers? or more likely what aren't i grasping here in this example",['discrete-mathematics']

Constructing a number not in $\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} (q_k-\frac{\epsilon}{2^k},q_k+\frac{\epsilon}{2^k})$ When I was considering a comment on Conditions for integrability , I began to think of a few facts on Lebesgue measure. I often used to have to reconvince myself that the measure of the rationals was zero, and I thought about this in particular. A standard way of showing that the measure of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is $0$ is to come up with your favorite enumeration of the rationals in $[0,1]$, and then put an $\epsilon$-ball around the first, an $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$-ball around the second, an $\frac{\epsilon}{2^2}$-ball around the third, and so on, so that the overall length is bounded by (in this case) $4 \epsilon$. One might go on to show that the measure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is $0$ by showing that a countable union of null sets is null, by doing an analogous argument with $\epsilon$ covers. Suppose for a moment that we look at the $\epsilon = 1/8$ covering, so that at most $1/2$ of $[0,1]$ is covered. Suppose we also that our enumeration of the rationals is the standard one of Cantor, i.e. It might be easier if we don't remove duplicates (still a proof of denumerability) so that we know the general $n^\text{th}$ number easier. Then my question is : can we explicitly find an irrational not covered by one of the $\epsilon$-balls? Perhaps it's deceptively easy. Can we find many?

151597,Conventional ordering of faces of regular polyhedron?,"e.g. For an icosahedron defined as follows: Diagram : A regular icosahedron (courtesy of Microsoft Visio): We define position and orientation w.r.t. this body's frame of reference as follows: Point O at the origin: (0, 0, 0) Point P within the half-line: (x=0, y>0, z=0) Point P1 within the half-line: (x=0, y<0, z=0) Point A within the quarter-plane: (x>0, y<0, z=0) Question 1: Formal methods/conventions? Is there (a) a formal way to index/order the faces of a regular polyhedron?  In other words, are some methods of ordering the faces/vertices etc., more correct, logical or conventional than certain other methods?  If not, then do certain face encodings/orderings facilitate more efficient vector manipulation?  How then should the faces be ordered, or, in what order should we generate their normal direction vectors? OR, is it (b) a matter of arbitrary discretion according to the requirements of the specific application one is designing for; or otherwise arbitrary due to fundamental constraints on the shape of the data structures & algorithms required to manipulate these data most efficiently? Question 2: Ordering for recursive precision Suppose we break each surface triangle down recursively into four sub-triangles so that: Any face may be folded if its edge-adjacent neighbours are also folded along common edges and their constituent sub-triangles stretched (each sub-triangle remaining flat but no longer remaining coplanar with each other); so as to more perfectly approximate the curved surface being modelled Each successive ≈4× improvement in area precision requires exactly two additional bits of information to store the resulting surface-positional “reference code” or “index number” Is there (a) a formal mathematical way to order or encode these constituent sub-triangles? Or is this (b) open to the engineer's discretion, to define a convention that he prefers? Do some encodings of the constituent triangles permit more efficient data manipulation, or is this choice arbitrary?  Can this be proven either way?  If the choice is theoretically arbitrary, then does a relevant mathematical convention already exist? Typical application: geographical data visualisation We will use this for data geocoding, indexing, querying & visualisation; using polyhedral projections from near-spherical shapes (the surface of the Earth) with the best all-round properties of: computational efficiency (for encoding/ retrieval/ visualisation) low spatial distortion, high area uniformity by code space information density conceptual simplicity Our general purposes are illustrated by this document: http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjPoly/projPoly.html#PolyhedralMaps Suggested conventions for mapping geographical data We will orient our icosahedral mapping so that: Point O (the origin) corresponds to the centre of mass of the body being modelled Point P corresponds to the geographical North Pole at +90° latitude Point P1 corresponds to geographical South Pole at −90° latitude Point A lies within the half-plane containing the prime meridian i.e. zero longitude in the standard modern polar (latitude, longitude) coordinates.  The icosahedral diagram here: http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/myriahedral/ — from Jack van Wijk's work on “myriahedral projections” appears to validate the near-optimality of this convention for planet Earth in the current geological era. For modelling or display purposes, the model polyhedron should be scaled such that its volume is equivalent to the modelled geoid.  Where the geoid is irregular and the modelling polyhedron is of high resolution, approximations to this rule might be considered acceptable. Reference design for encoding surfaces/ positions Unless advised of a better way, we plan to order the faces first according to their apex orientation with triangle base perpendicular to (P→P1), whether up/down with respect to vector (P→P1); and second (for each orientation) in a spiral/helix, working first anticlockwise around (P→P1), and then clockwise around (P1→P) for the opposite apex orientation.  This would number the 20 main triangles from 0 to 4, 8 to 12, 16 to 20 and 24 to 28 as follows: +   0           1           2           3           4
 0   P  A1 B1;   P  B1 C1;   P  C1 D1;   P  D1 E1;   P  E1 A1;
 8   A1 A  B ;   B1 B  C ;   C1 C  D ;   D1 D  E ;   E1 E  A ;
16   P1 B  A ;   P1 C  B ;   P1 D  C ;   P1 E  D ;   P1 A  E ;
24   B  B1 A1;   C  C1 B1;   D  D1 C1;   E  E1 D1;   A  A1 E1; — This coding system has discontinuities to simplify logical functions for calculating surface polygon orientation, which is necessary for translating position data between systems of coordinates (orientation might be considered on the basis of individual triangles, or cumulatively on the basis of recursive N-ary sum style positional calculations).  Note that the rows in this table correspond to horizontally oriented slices of the icosahedron, whereas the columns in this table correspond to diagonally (near-vertically) oriented half-slices. We plan to encode each sub-triangle recursively as per: File format; recursion-conforming data compression We plan to support data compression and adaptive rendering by storing at each detail level only the differences from the average values corresponding to the hierarchical parent surface.  In accordance with this objective, location codes will be stored and communicated in a big-endian format.  If modelling a perfect unit sphere, the “unit sphere” should be of unit radius .  The volume of the unit spheroid/geoid etc. should generally approach 4π/3 cubic units as closely as possible (altitudes should be defined in proportion with such a unit geoid, and a scale factor should be specified for the entire geoid). Community benefits (public domain, IP considerations) To promote industrial standardisation; I now release these plans freely here, and will further consider releasing my work freely when complete as a set of open-source software libraries.  For the record, I (Matthew Slyman) started working independently on this project some time around the year 1993, and first proposed this idea to Iestyn Bleasdale-Shepherd late in 1996 (he implemented the first proof-of-concept as an IBM PC program written in C over the Christmas holidays of 1996–1997).  We subsequently shelved the original application we were discussing; and as the originator of this idea and the sole developer of this specification, I (Matthew Slyman) hereby relinquish any claim to the intellectual property rights for this data structure or any compatible code implementations that might be created by third parties.  In order to better serve the mathematical community, I would like to give priority at the design/implementation stage to any relevant formal mathematical requirements or conventions.  Anyone commenting on this thread thereby places their comments likewise in the public domain, for general community benefit.  In the absence of further instruction, we will number the faces according to our practical requirements or whims (see above).  We would be grateful for any formal improvements that can be offered by anyone better educated in mathematics. I propose to give this standardised set of conventions a name: “ Icosamap ”.  Please register any objections to this name, including links to any evidence of priority within the relevant field of science.","['geometry', 'polyhedra']"

\dim(\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)) = \dim(V)\dim(W)

151635,Generalizing the total probability of simultaneous occurrences for independent events,"I want to generalize a formula and I need your help with this. This is not my homework or assignment but I need to come up with a concise formula that fits my documentation. Background for my problem: Considering all events to be independent of each other, Let the probability of $Event$ $0$ be $P_{0}$ and $Event$ $1$ be $P_{1}$ and so on ... Then the probability that two events occur simultaneously is : $P_0P_1$ . This is nothing but the area of intersection of two circles $P_0$ and $P_1$. Continuing the same way, The total probability of simultaneous occurrence in case of three events is: $P_0 P_1 + P_0P_2 + P_1P_2 - 2 P_{0}P_{1}P_{2}$. Also can be visualized by drawing three intersecting circles. One clarification here: This gives me the total probability of any two events plus  all the three occurring at the same time right? I cannot visualize the formula by drawing circles anymore. How can the above formula be generalized to get the probability of simultaneous occurrences when there are 4, 5, ... independent events. I have seen that the inclusion-exclusion principle is the answer. But I am not able to get an intuition for it. The inclusion-exclusion principle gives the probability of 2,3,4 sets intersecting but isn't my question different? I get this doubt because, probability of four independent events occurring simultaneous is: $P_0P_1P_2P_3$. But what I need is a general formula for the total probability of two or more independent events at the same time. Can anyone of you please throw some light? Yes indeed I meant that the probability of ""two or more events"". The answer you have given is very precise and the one I was looking for. Yes it is boring to try to visualize circles when the number exceeds three. Instead, in general if use 1 - ($w_0 + w_1$) then we should land up correctly given that the events are independent. Thank you so much.",['probability']
