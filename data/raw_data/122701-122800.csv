  Let $f$ be a random variable that counts all fixed points of all functions in $ \Omega $
  $$ f(\omega) = |\{i \in \{1,2,3,...,n\}: \omega(i)=i\}$$ Well, I had two ideas which ended the same way.
In both of them I defined n indicators $f_1,f_2,f_3...f_n$, such that for each $ 1\leq i\leq n$, return 1 if $f(i)=i$ and 0 otherwise.
Than, the expected value is the sum of $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i$ First idea Looking at index i, the probability to choose i as an image is $Pr(fi=1)= \frac{1}{n}$ then the expected value is $\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}...+\frac{1}{n}=\frac{n}{n}=1$ Second idea For index i there is one option, and for the rest of the indexes are free to be chosen, so $Pr(fi=1) = \frac{1 \cdot n^{n-1}}{n^n}$ Then the expected value is once again the sum, which is $ n \cdot \frac{n^{n-1}}{n^n} = \frac{n}{n}=1 $ Am I on the right track or totally lost?","['expectation', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1847222,Real Analysis question that affects how to think about the Dirac delta function.,"Okay, here are the ingredients to this question. Me: 60 years old.  39 years ago I took two semesters of Real Analysis using the Royden textbook.  Rusty is an understatement.  But I am still quite anal and OCD.  I am also an electrical engineer, works in signal processing.  DSP and Linear System Theory are important to me.  I have also had two semesters (as a grad student) of Functional Analysis (using the Kreyszig text) and multiple courses in probability, random variables, and random processes (a.k.a. ""stochastic processes""). Electrical Engineers (and I suspect many physicists) essentially treat $\delta(x)$ as a ""function"".  But it isn't.  One thing I remember from R.A. is that if $$ f(x) = g(x) $$ almost everywhere in $E$, then $$ \int_E f(x) \, dx \ = \ \int_E g(x) \, dx $$ problem is, of course, that electrical engineers (and their professors) like to think of $$\begin{align} f(x) & = \delta(x) \\
g(x) & = 0 \end{align} $$ and that $$ \int\limits_{-1}^{+1} f(x) \, dx = 1 \quad \ne \quad \int\limits_{-1}^{+1} g(x) \, dx = 0 $$ yet $f(x) = g(x)$ everywhere except at one single value of $x$ . Now I have heard (or read) that the ""Dirac delta function is not really a function but is a ' distribution ' or a ' functional '.""  And I understand the meaning of the terms ""distribution"" in the context of random variables and ""functional"" in the context of metric spaces, normed spaces, etc.  Is that the given usage of these two terms regarding $\delta(x)$? Question 1:  Is the usage of the notation $$ \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x) \, \delta(x) \, dx $$ a misnomer?  There is no integration going on.  It's just a linear functional that maps the function $f(x)$ to the number $f(0)$.  Now EEs and maybe physicists will comfortably look at that as an integral that is the same as $$ \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(0) \, \delta(x) \, dx = f(0)\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \delta(x) \, dx = f(0) $$ But since $\delta(x)$ is not a function at all, what do mathematicians mean with that notation? Question 2:  How fatal is it for electrical engineers and physicists to consistently treat the Dirac delta function simply as a limit of ""nascent deltas"" such as $$ \delta(x) \ \triangleq \ \lim_{\sigma \to 0^+} \frac{1}{ \sigma} \operatorname{rect} \left( \frac{x}{\sigma} \right) $$ where $ \operatorname{rect}(x) \triangleq 
\begin{cases} 
1 \quad |x|<\frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} \quad |x|=\frac{1}{2} \\
0 \quad |x|>\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{cases} $ or $$ \delta(x) \ \triangleq \ \lim_{\sigma \to 0^+} \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2} $$ What is gonna kill us to simple-mindedly treat the Dirac delta as such a function ?  A function that is zero almost everywhere, yet it integrates to be equal to 1 (where the function that is zero everywhere integrates to be 0). If we do that, within our own disciplines, what mathematical problem might crop up that kills us? This is not exactly the same but smells a lot like this concern from Richard Hamming : “Does anyone believe that the difference between the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals can have physical significance, and that whether say, an airplane would or would not fly could depend on this difference? If such were claimed, I should not care to fly in that plane.” I might ask the same question regarding the mathematician's and the engineer's understanding of the Dirac delta function.  How might a mathematician answer that question?","['dirac-delta', 'real-analysis', 'integration']"

1847447,Is statistical physics background desirable for probability theory?,"I am talking about higher probability viz. Brownian Motion, Ergodic Theory, Concentration, Percolation, Random Graphs, Random Matrix, etc. Going through books, I find that somehow or the other, many theorems in probability come from motivation from physics: they observe a physics phenomenon, then they think about it mathematically, and out comes a theorem. Probably I'll give an example. Dynamical systems are, in my opinion, an offshoot of physics. The very concept of ergodicity i.e. measure-theoretic non-decomposability of the system into two non-trivial components can be best motivated using the free flow of gas molecules in a room, rather than just writing some dry $T^{-1}A=A\implies \mu(A)\mu(A^c)=0$. The latter is of course fine, and rigorous and precise, but does not really tell the story. I want to do research in probability. I have a firm understanding of the mathematics. However, I have not done any undergraduate or graduate physics course. So I am afraid that despite knowing the maths, my knowledge will be dry and if I wish to devise a theorem, I have to heavily rely on measures and stuff, on purely mathematical inequalities, although if I have an understanding of statistical mechanics, then at least I would be able to ""guess"" what my bounds can be, say for inequalities, or what I really want to say.

$$ Now I wanted to generalize the above problem, but failed. The problem is as follows. Consider that there are N different numbered balls that exist {1,2,...,N}. Moreover, there are two buckets A having n and B having m uniquely numbered balls. A and B might have balls of the same color. e.g. N = 10, A = {#1,#2,#3} and B = {#2,#3,#4} What is the probability P that if we pick d balls from A, exactly 1 ball is absent in B. e.g. d = 2. So we pick {#1,#2} and #1 is unique to bucket B. The answer can I could derive is: Given we know the number of balls common in A and B as k, $$

This conjecture is unsolved even for $k = 3$. If one wanted to create a sequence that ""maximizes"" its sum of reciprocals while avoiding APs of length $3$, one naive approach would be to start the sequence with $1$, then have each subsequent term be the smallest number that does not create an AP of length three with the previous terms. This sequence is OEIS 3278 . My questions are as follows: are there any sequences (that we know of) which avoid APs of length three while having a larger sum of reciprocals than OEIS 3278?

For $f, g \in \textbf{F}^S$, the sum $f + g \in \textbf{F}^S$ is the function defined by
  $$(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$$
  for all $x \in S$. For $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ and $f \in \textbf{F}^S$, the product $\lambda f \in \textbf{F}^S$ is the function defined by

As an example of the notation above, if $S$ is the interval [0,1] and $\textbf{F} = \textbf{R}$, then $\textbf{R}^{[0,1]}$ is the set of real-valued functions on the interval [0,1]. In the next paragraph, the author goes on to assert the following: Our previous examples of vector spaces, $\textbf{F}^n$ and $\textbf{F}^\infty$, are special cases of the vector space $\textbf{F}^S$ because a list of length $n$ of numbers in $\textbf{F}$ can be thought of as a function from {1, 2, ..., $n$} to $\textbf{F}$ and a sequence of numbers in $\textbf{F}$ can be thought of as a function from the set of positive integers to $\textbf{F}$.  In other words, we can think of $\textbf{F}^n$ as $\textbf{F}^{\{1,2,...,n\}}$ and we can think of $\textbf{F}^\infty$ as $\textbf{F}^{\{1,2,...\}}$. It's at this point I get confused, due mostly to the example which relies on $\textbf{R}^{[0,1]}$.  It seems to me that then number of elements in $\textbf{R}^{[0,1]}$ should be uncountably infinite and that I should be able to generate any value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ from [0,1] using some member of $\textbf{R}^{[0,1]}$, which feels a whole lot like generating a point in $\textbf{R}^\infty$. If that's the case, then what's the difference between a tuple generated from $\textbf{R}^{\{1,2,...,n\}}$ and one generated from $\textbf{R}^{\{1,2,...,n+1\}}$?

Consider how often the most frequently chosen coupon, was chosen , that is, the random variable $$C^*_n=\max_{1\leqslant k\leqslant n}C_k^{n}.
$$ Can one compute $E(C^*_n)$? What is a simple asymptotics of $E(C^*_n)$ when $n$ grows large? Does $C_n^*/E(C^*_n)$ converge in distribution and, if it does, what is its limit? Note that $C_1^n+C_2^n+\cdots+C_n^n=T_n$. Since $E(T_n)=nH_n$ where $H_n=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac1k$ denotes the $n$th harmonic number, such that $H_n=\log n+O(1)$, one has $E(C_n^*)\geqslant\log n$ and $E(C_n^*)=O(n\log n)$. In a somewhat more ambitious version of this question, consider the nondecreasing rearrangement $C_{(1)}^n\leqslant C_{(2)}^n\leqslant\cdots\leqslant C_{(n)}^n$ of $(C_1^n,C_2^n,\ldots,C_n^n)$. Thus, $C_{(1)}^n=1$ and $C_{(n)}^n=C_n^*$. Can one compute (or, get some simple asymptotics of) each $E(C^n_{(k)})$? And what is the ""profile"" of the random vector $(C_{(1)}^n,C_{(2)}^n,\ldots,C_{(n)}^n)$ when $n$ grows large? To be specific: Does the random vector $$\left(\frac{C_{(1)}^n}{C_{(n)}^n},\frac{C_{(2)}^n}{C_{(n)}^n},\ldots,\frac{C_{(n)}^n}{C_{(n)}^n}\right)$$ converge in distribution and, if it does, what is its limit? Edit: Amy N. Myers and Herbert S. Wilf ( Some New Aspects of the Coupon Collector's Problem , SIAM Review 48(3), 2006) provide explicit formulas for the distribution and the mean of the number $S_n$ of singletons. In the notations above, $S_n$ is the size of the set of $1\leqslant k\leqslant n$ such that $C^n_k=1$, and also the maximum of the set of $1\leqslant k\leqslant n$ such that $C^n_{(k)}=1$. Myers and Wilf show that, for every $i$, $$P(S_n=i)=i{n\choose i}\int_0^\infty x^{i-1}(e^x-1-x)^{n-i}e^{-nx}dx,$$ and they deduce from this the esthetically pleasing identity $$E(S_n)=H_n.$$","['probability-limit-theorems', 'coupon-collector', 'probability-theory']"

Let me ask questions on Lusin's theorem from Rudin's RCA. $1)$ As we know $s_n=\varphi_n \circ f$ (from Theorem 1.17) then $$2^nt_n(x)=2^n(s_n(x)-s_{n-1}(x))=2^n(\varphi_n \circ f(x)-\varphi_{n-1} \circ f(x))=\dots$$ As $0\leq f<1$ then $$\dots=2^n\left(\dfrac{[2^nf(x)]}{2^n}-\dfrac{[2^{n-1}f(x)]}{2^{n-1}}\right)=[2^nf(x)]-2[2^{n-1}f(x)]$$ where $[\cdot]$ - integer part. Also the last equality above can be equal $0$ or $1$ since $[2\theta]-2[\theta]\in \{0,1\}$. An it's equal to $1$ if $\theta\in \bigcup \limits_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}[k+\frac{1}{2},k+1)$. So $2^nt_n(x)=1$ if $2^{n-1}f(x) \in \bigcup \limits_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}[k+\frac{1}{2},k+1)$ $\Rightarrow$ $x  \in \bigcup \limits_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}f^{-1}([2^{-(n-1)}(k+\frac{1}{2}),2^{-(n-1)}(k+1)))$. So $T_n$ is the last set and it's measurable, i.e. $T_n \in \mathfrak{M}$. Am I right? $2)$ When he write that ""$(1)$ holds if $A$ is compact and $f$ is a bounded measurable function"" what does he mean about $f$? Non-negative function or not? Is non-negative then we must replace $f$ by $\alpha^{-1}f$ where $\alpha=\sup f+1$. $3)$ Let's Go further. Let's take a look at penultimate paragraph which I marked by red line. I understood that if $A$ is any set with finite measure then by inner regularity we can find compact set $K\subset A$ such that $m(A-K)$ as small as needed. Note that $f$ outside $K$ possibly is not zero! And we can't apply above proof because there we use that $f=0$ on $A^c$. $4)$ Also why considers sets $B_n$?

1848138,Why is this not a valid algorithm for counting poker hands?,"In my probability class, we had an example asking what is the probability of getting three of a kind when randomly drawing $5$ cards from a typical deck ($13$ denomination and $4$ suits, total of $52$ cards). Three of a kind is defines as getting three cards with the same denomination and two other cards which each have a unique denomination (looks like $AAABC$). The correct answer is as follows: 1) Choose denomination $A$, this can be done in $\binom{13}{1}$ ways 2) Choose the 3 suits for denomination $A$, this can be done in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways 3) Choose the remaining two denominations, $B$ and $C$, this can be done in $\binom{12}{2}$ ways 4) Choose the suits for the remaining two denominations, this can be done in $\binom{4}{1}$ ways for each So the probability of getting three of a kind is: $$\frac {\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}} \approx 0.02112845$$ Now my solution is mostly the same, however when selecting the denominations $B$ and $C$ I say that this can be done by selecting denomination $B$ in $\binom{12}{1}$ ways with $\binom{4}{1}$ possible suits.

1848163,What's a morphism? Well it's a morphism.,"I'm confused on the definition of an ""$F$-morphism"" of $F$-varieties.  The textbook is Springer, Linear Algebraic Groups .  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and $F$ a subfield of $k$.  The notions of an affine $F$-variety, and of a morphism of affine $F$-varieties, are clear to me. An affine $F$-algebra is a geometrically reduced, finitely generated $F$-algebra $A_0$.  One tensors with $k$ over $F$ to get a reduced, finitely generated $k$-algebra $A = k \otimes_F A_0$, and then defines on $\textrm{Spm } A$ a subtopology of '$F$-open sets' satisfying certain properties, and calls $\textrm{Spm } A$ together with the $F$-open sets an affine $F$-variety . One then defines a morphism of affine $F$-varieties in such a way that the category of affine $F$-algebras is antiequivalent to that of affine $F$-varieties. Next one defines an arbitrary $F$-variety to be an algebraic variety over $k$ with some extra properties: What I don't understand is the definition of a morphism between $F$-varieties.  If I'm not mistaken, he is saying that in order that $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of $F$-varieties, it must be the case that for any $F$-open set $V$ in $Y$, the preimage $\phi^{-1}V$ must be $F$-open in $X$, and the restriction of $\phi$ to $\phi^{-1}V$ must be a morphism of $F$-varieties $\phi^{-1}V \rightarrow V$. As the definition is, it seems to be circular: what does it mean for $\phi^{-1}V \rightarrow V$ to be a morphism? Since we do have a well defined notion of a morphism of affine $F$-varieties, my naive guess as to how to fix the definition would be: If $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of varieties between $F$-varieties $X, Y$, we say that $\phi$ is a morphism of $F$-varieties if the preimage of any $F$-open subset of $Y$ is $F$-open in $X$, and for any $F$-open affine set $V$, and any affine $F$-open cover $U_i$ of $\phi^{-1}V$, the restriction of $\phi$ to $U_i$ is a morphism of affine $F$-varieties $U_i \rightarrow V$.",['algebraic-geometry']

First of all, I didn't understand the question. For example $x^2$ takes $1$ twice, in the interval $[-1,1]$. Is it saying that it does not occur for all $x$ in the interval? But what about $f(x) = c$? Is it saying that it does not occur only exactly $2$ times, then? I have no idea about how to prove it.

Now, there's the following proof in my book and I really wanted to understand it, instead of just getting a new proof Since the interval $[a,b]$ has only $2$ extreme points, then the maximum or minimum of $f$ must be in a point $c\in int([a,b])$ and and in another point $d\in [a,b]$. Then, there exists $\delta>0$ such that in the intervals $[c-\delta, c), (c,c+\delta)$ (and if $d$ is not extreme of $[a,b]$, $[d-\delta, d]$) the function takes values that are less than $f(c) = f(d)$.

Why is it that I can apply the intermediate value theorem to these values? For example, $<f(c-\delta)<p<f(c)$, then by the theorem I know that there exists $m\in [c-\delta, c)$ such that $f(m) = p$. Same for the other intervals.

1848263,Properties of a finite field extension of degree 2.,"I am bad (but trying to improve!) at very basic number theory and algebra. I'm quite sure this question is easy, but I do not know what fundamentals I am missing. This is from Ireland & Rosen's ""Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory"" and is question 10 of Chapter 7. I have copied it exactly. Let $K\supset F$ be finite fields and $[K:F]=2$. For $\beta\in K$ show that $\beta^{1+q}\in F$ and moreover that every element in $F$ is of the form $\beta^{1+q}$ for some $\beta\in K$. The question uses the context of the previous one, in which $|F|=q$. What I've tried so far: For the first part, it seems there are two cases: i) $\beta\in F$ or ii) $\beta\in K\backslash F$. In i) it is easy, since $\beta^q=\beta$ and the extension is of degree $2$, $\beta^{q+1}=\beta^2\in F$. In ii), I suppose the minimal polynomial of $\beta$ in $K[x]$ is $x^2-\beta^2=x^2-\beta^{q+1}$... but where to go from here? And I can't even begin to see what to do with the second part of the problem. Is any of this right so far? What do I do next if so? Thanks so much, ya'll. I'll go try to answer a question I can help with in the meantime.","['finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'elementary-number-theory']"

Wind evidently blows around this solid object over its rigid surface. Bascially we are trying to set up a pure field. At each point of this surface, we can record the wind speed having some magnitude (say like Einstein puts tiny clocks at all coordinates of space to measure time). If at any time instant $t$, this undescribed mechanism records all values of speeds over the surface without repetition as follows $\mathscr{V}=[v_1,v_2,...,v_n]$ Then for some $v\in \mathscr{V}$, can we draw level set-type plots on the surface by joining all points having same speed $v$ by a curve on the surface such that:- a) if such curves exist, they necessarily form closed loops? b) And there are non-zero number ( meaning at least one or more ) of closed contours on the surface? What are the seminal sources where existence proofs of such kind are studied that analyse the necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of closed level sets for a given field?

Question 1 : Doesn't one have to restrict this to the sphere? By that I mean compose with the differential of the inclusion map $i:S^{2n +1}\hookrightarrow \mathbb R^{2n +2}$.

  $i$ be not defined on all of the sphere (but only chartwise)? When restricted I expect $\omega$ to become an expression of only $2n+1$ coordinates.

Thank you so much. EDIT: Thank you so much for all the replies. I have now read some basic set theory from Enderton's text.

 \forall c \exists B \forall x ( x \in B \Leftrightarrow x \in c, f(x))
 $$ Well-defineness: Given a Topological Space $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $A \subseteq X$. Firstly, $\mathcal{T}_X$ is a well-defined set. This is because, by the PSA, set
  $\mathcal{P}(X)$ exists and is unique by EA. So by the AoS, $\mathcal{T}_X : = \{ x \in \mathcal {P}(X) : f(x)  \}$
  (where $f(x)$ is a formula of $x$ for its openess) exists, and is unique by EA. Define the collection of closed sets which contains $A$ by,  $$ \mathcal{C} := \{ x
 \in \mathcal{P}(X) : x^c \in \mathcal{T}_X, A \subseteq x \}$$  which exists by AoS
  and is unique by EA. Also, $\mathcal{C}$ is nonempty ($X$ is in
  the set) so the set $$ \bigcap \mathcal{C} := \{ x \in X : \forall y
 \in \mathcal{C}, x \in y \} = \bar{A}$$  again exists by AoS, and is
  unique by EA, so the closure is well-defined.","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"
1848370,A scheme is affine iff the natural map $X\to \operatorname{Spec}\Gamma(X)$ is an isomorphism,"We know that the functor $\operatorname{Spec}: \mathsf{Rings}^{\text{op}}\to \mathsf{Schemes}$ is right adjoint to the global section functor $\Gamma: \mathsf{Schemes}\to  \mathsf{Rings}^{\text{op}}$. So there is a bijection
$$
\operatorname{Hom}(X, \operatorname{Spec} A) \to \operatorname{Hom}(A, \Gamma(X))
$$
which is natural in both variables. So if $X$ is a scheme, then we can set $A=\Gamma(X)$ and we get a bijection $\operatorname{Hom}(X, \operatorname{Spec} \Gamma(X)) \simeq \operatorname{Hom}(\Gamma(X), \Gamma(X))$. As a result, the identity map $\Gamma(X)\to \Gamma(X)$ gives rise to a natural map $X\to\operatorname{Spec}(\Gamma(X))$.  My question is this: If $X$ is affine, why does it follow that the natural map $X\to \operatorname{Spec}(\Gamma(X))$ is an isomorphism? The proof probably uses some formal naturality properties of adjoints, but nobody usually bothers to explicitly write this stuff down! So I am also tagging (category-theory) to attract experts from there. I would very much appreciate it if someone could give a complete explanation. Motivation. This result is pretty useful. For example, we need this fact to conclude that $X=\mathbb{A}^2-\{0, 0\}$ is not affine. Indeed, the standard proof goes by showing $\Gamma(X)=\mathbb{C}[x,y]$, but then the natural map $X\to \operatorname{Spec}(\Gamma(X))=\mathbb{A}^2$ is not an isomorphism, so $X$ is not affine.","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

As in the title, I was wondering whether the entropy of a system (it can be any entropy, from Boltzmann to Renyi etc, it is of no importance) is a function or a functional and why? Since it is mostly defined as:
$$S(p)=\sum_{i}g(p_i) $$
for some $g$ that has to be continous etc then it has to be a functional. But then I see that $S_{BG}$ for example, which is defined as $S_{BG}=\sum_i p_i \log p_i$ just needs the value of each $p_i$ in order to be defined, right?
