1953068,Probability Question About Basketball Free Throws and Distributions [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed last year . Improve this question I was trying to solve the following question from the Harvard Stat $110$ course, from the book Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang, but could not wrap my head around it. Any and all help is appreciated, especially with part (b): A certain basketball player practices shooting free throws over and over
  again. The shots are independent, with probability p of success. (a) In $n$ shots, what is the expected number of streaks of $7$ consecutive successful shots?
  (Note that, for example, $9$ in a row counts as $3$ streaks.) (b) Now suppose that the player keeps shooting until making $7$ shots in a row for the first time. Let $X$ be the number of shots taken. Show that $E(X) ≤ 7/p^7.$ Hint: Consider the first $7$ trials as a block, then the next $7$ as a block, etc.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions']"

If it is true, do we have a generalization in $\mathbb{R}^n$? My partial answer for $p=1$: For $p=1$ and  $t\in \mathbb{R}$, we have
$$

1953185,Tensors and matrices multiplication,"I have to prove an equality between matrices $R=OTDO$ where $R$ is a $M\times M$ matrix $O$ is a $2\times M$ matrix $T$ is a $M\times M\times M$ tensor $D$ is a diagonal $2\times 2$ matrix The entries of the matrices and the tensor are probabilities so the result should somehow be the consequence of Bayes formula. The problem is that I have no idea how to compute that because I don't know how to use tensors. I had an algebra course about tensor products of vector spaces a long time ago but it was very abstract so I don't know how to multiply tensors in practice. I'm surprised because the first matrix of the product has $2$ rows, the last one has $M$ columns and yet the result is a $M\times M$ matrix. Could you explain how to do this? For example, what's the dimension of $OT$? I am familiar with the Kronecker product of matrices, is it useful here? EDIT Stupid me... I've spent hours trying to understand this product and... this was a typo. It was $O^TDO$ and the equality was straightforward... I've been confused by the fact that the tensor $T$ did exist and there could be and equality involving it. At least I've learnt a few things about tensors, thank you again for the answers!","['matrices', 'tensors']"
1953202,Architecture of Cantor's proof,"Cantor's diagonal argument consists of two parts: bijection and the extraction of the new number. If he shows that a given architecture of bijection doesn't work, why does it imply that any other architecture of bijection should not work either? Just an addendum to make my point clearer: Another possible architecture that comes to my mind is to write real numbers in the table and correspond them to the nth power of 2. Then we start to construct new numbers that weren't listed in our table and correspond them with powers of 3. After that we construct new numbers from the table of power of 3 (even if without checking we had them in the first table) we correspond them to the nth power of 5, and so on and so forth.
It is easy to notice that this is a poor bijection architecture as you can put them back into one list and just repeat the construction of the new number.
Why can it be mapped back to a simple list for any architecture? On the other hand we can easily think of correspondence of natural numbers to itself, in a way that we will end up having extra unlisted numbers.E.g.(1->2,2->4, etc...). Obviously it doesn't imply that there are more natural numbers than 'natural numbers'.",['elementary-set-theory']
1953218,"Is ""The empty set is a subset of any set"" a convention?","Recently I learned that for any set A, we have $\varnothing\subset A$. I found some explanation of why it holds. $\varnothing\subset A$ means ""for every object $x$, if $x$ belongs to the empty set, then $x$ also belongs to the set A"". This is a vacuous truth, because the antecedent ($x$ belongs to the empty set) could never be true, so the conclusion always holds ($x$ also belongs to the set A). So $\varnothing\subset A$ holds. What confused me was that, the following expression was also a vacuous truth. For every object  $x$, if $x$ belongs to the empty set, then $x$ doesn't belong to the set A. According to the definition of the vacuous truth, the conclusion ($x$ doesn't belong to the set A) holds, so $\varnothing\not\subset A$ would be true, too. Which one is correct? Or is it just a convention to let $\varnothing\subset A$?","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1953256,The Velocities of the Contact Points of Two Rolling Curves are Equal at the Instant of Contact,"Consider two 2-Dimensional rigid bodies surrounded by two planar smooth curves. Suppose that the two bodies are in the same plane and in contact with each other such that they are rolling with respect to each other. To demonstrate the meaning of rolling , suppose that the points $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the figure below are the contact points at the present time and the points $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the points that will be in contact after some time. Then the rolling condition is defined as $s_1=s_2$. So our definition of rolling is Definition . Two smooth curves are said to be rolling with respect to each other if the length of their contacted portions during a time interval is equal. Now, the main question is to prove the following theorem Theorem . Two smooth curves are rolling with respect to each other if and only if the velocity vectors of the contact points are equal to each other at the instant of contact. So the theorem is expressing an equivalent condition for rolling . Simple versions of the theorem are rolling of a circle over a straight line , inclined line, another circle, ellipse or parabola (See the animation below). Taking a look at the links will help you to visualize better. Without loss of generality you can assume that curve $2$ is still and curve $1$ is rolling on it. This is a well-known theorem that is taught to mechanical engineering students in a Machine Dynamics course without a proof! I was not able to find the proof anywhere in the engineering, physical or mathematical texts. I would be happy to see a full detailed answer but I do not expect one. Also, I have not defined the problem rigorously so if you see flaws you can modify it as you wish. But I think you can imagine what I mean by the examples and links I provided. Any guidance, help or hint is welcome and appreciated. This animation is made by J.

1953363,Exercise II-3 from Eisenbud & Harris' The Geometry of Schemes,"I am having difficulty with the following exercise and would appreciate any help and explanations. Exercise II-3 on page 52 of The Geometry of Schemes by Eisenbud and Harris, but I give the setup first. The setup: We have $K$ -algebra inclusions $K[x,y] \hookrightarrow K[x,y]_{(x,y)} \hookrightarrow K[[x,y]]$ , where $K[x,y]$ is the commutative polynomial ring over $K$ in two variables, $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is the polynomial ring localised at the maximal ideal $(x,y)$ , and $K[[x,y]]$ the commutative formal power series ring in two variables. These maps induce maps on the spectra as follows: $$\operatorname{Spec}K[[x,y]]\to\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y]_{(x,y)}\to\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y].$$ Consider the prime ideal $(y^{2}-x^{3}-x^{2})$ of $K[x,y]$ . This is still prime in $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ . However, in $K[[x,y]]$ we now have $$y^{2}-x^{3}-x^{2}=(y-u)(y+u)$$ where $u=x+\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \frac{1}{16}x^4 - \cdots$ . Exercise II-3. (a) With $u=\sqrt{x^2 +x^3}$ as above, what is the image of $[(y-u)]$ in $\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y]$ ? (Hint: it's a prime ideal containing $y^2 -x^3 -x^2$ .) (b) Show that the image of the point $(y-\Sigma_{n\geq 1}\frac{x^n}{n!})$ of $\operatorname{Spec}K[[x,y]]$ is the generic point of $\mathbb{A}^2_K = \operatorname{Spec}K[x,y].$ My attempt for (a): $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is local with unique maximal ideal $(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ and has Krull dimension $2 = \operatorname{ht}(x,y)$ . $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is a prime ideal containing the prime ideal $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)$ , so we have the following chain of primes: $$(0)\subsetneq(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)\subseteq (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}\subseteq (x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}.$$ As this is happening in a ring of Krull dimension 2, this means we have only two options: either $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)= (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ or $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}= (x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ . Now I claim that $$(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)} \neq(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}. $$ If we did have $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)} =(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ , then we would have $x\in(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)},$ so that $x\in ((y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)})\cdot K[[x,y]]\subseteq (y-u)$ . This would also yield $y= y-u+u= y-u +x+\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \frac{1}{16}x^4 - \cdots=y-u +x(1+\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16}x^3 - \cdots)\in (y-u).$ Therefore, we would have $(x,y)\subseteq (y-u)$ and hence $(x,y)=(y-u)$ as $(x,y)$ is maximal in $K[[x,y]].$ But $$ K[[x]] \cong K[[x,y]]/(y-u) = K[[x,y]]/(x,y) \cong K $$ yields a contradiction. Thus, $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)} \neq(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ and so we must have $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)= (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ . Finally, contracting back to $\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y]$ we have that $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]=(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)\cap K[x,y]=(y^2 -x^3 -x^2).$ My question: is my argument correct? If so, great. If not, could you explain why and what the correct answer is?

1953651,Difference between line integral and Lebesgue integral over set containing the line in $\mathbb{R}^2$,"It has been awhile since I last did any vector calculus, but this question got me thinking about line integrals and how they differ from Lebesgue integrals over sets containing the line. Considering the function given in the linked post,
$$ f(x,y)=\begin{cases} xy \ \ \text{if}\ \  x=y\\
0 \ \ \ \ \text{if}\ \ x\neq y\end{cases}$$
 suppose we want to calculate the line integral of $f$ along the line $x=y$ from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$, call the curve $\Gamma$. We can use standard techniques to find that the answer is given by
\begin{align*}
\int_\Gamma f(x,y)ds & =\sqrt2\int_0^1t^2dt \\
& =\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}.
\end{align*} Now the Lebesgue integral in the linked post is
$$\int_Afd\mu$$
where $A$ is the unit square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Now I understand that because the measure of the subset of $A$ on which is $f$ is non-zero is $0$ the integral is $0$, but in some way I can't help thinking that this is equivalent to integrating the function $f(x,y)=xy$ over the line $\Gamma$. Obviously this is not the case, but I don't really understand why as I'm quite a novice when it comes to measure theory. If someone could explain where my intuition is going wrong I'd be very appreciative. EDIT: Levap's brilliant answer aided me in coming up with an intuitive feeling for why the 2 are different. The line integral can intuitively thought to be the ""area"" of the function under the curve. If the curve is non-zero and not symmetric obviously the area will also be non-zero. The general integral (Riemann or Lebesgue) over a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ can intuitively thought to be the volume underneath the function over an area in $\mathbb{R^2}$. However, as function is only non-zero underneath a one-dimensional line the integral is actually giving the volume underneath a line, which is obviously $0$ because one of the values for the three ""dimensions"" used to calculate volume is $0$. This corresponds nicely with the standard Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb{R^2}$ of a line being $0$.","['integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'line-integrals']"

You might call $F\setminus(\alpha)$ something like a deletion. The thing about this is that you can then undo any field extension. That is, $F(\alpha) \setminus (\alpha)=F$. Does this concept have a name? So naturally, I am wondering if any elements can be ""deleted"" in this manner from $\mathbb{R}$. I realized that for $\alpha=\sqrt{2}$, there is no such field $E$ such that $E(\alpha)=\mathbb{R}$. If there was, there would be $a,b \in E$ such that $2^{1/4}=a+b\sqrt{2}$ as $\mathbb{R}$ is an extension of $E$ and the fourth root is in $\mathbb{R}$. Squaring, and with some algebra (being careful with avoiding division by zero), one gets the contradiction that $\sqrt{2} \in E$. I haven't thought this through carefully, but I believe for any algebraic number we have a similar failure. That is, there is a polynomial of degree $n$, $p \in E(x)$, with $p(\alpha)=0$. Then in particular $\alpha^{1/k} = p_k(\alpha)$ for $p_k$ of degree $n$. Raising to the $k$th power we get $\alpha = q_k(\alpha)$ for $q_k$ polynomial of degree $n$. This gives a linear system in $\alpha^k$ and my hunch it is nonsingular or the singular cases can be dealt with. The above is for algebraic numbers. I think the above can be used to show, for instance, that $\pi$ cannot work as it is likely algebraic over $E$ as $E$ contains many transcendental numbers.

1954467,Associanize a magma,"This is a thing I have been thinking on and gotten a bit frustrated so I share my thoughts here in hope for clarification. Let $M$ be a magma, that is a set with an underlying binary operation which we denote $\cdot$. The binary operation is not necessarily associative, that is we do not necessarily have 
$$a\cdot (b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$$
Here is the issue at hand, in group theory we can ""make"" a group abelian by taking the quotient with its commutator subgrouop, $G/[G,G]$, which is abelian, I am wondering if there is something similar for magmas but for associativity. Of course having dealt with universal algebra, semirings and semigroups (which is the target here in a way) what I need to work with is a relation, more specificly a congruence relation so I figured I would start defining it as such. So I started by saying that $e \mathrel{R} f$, or $(e,f)\in R$, if there exists some $a,b,c\in M$ such that $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = e$ and $a\cdot (b\cdot c) = f$, seemed like a good place to start for me in my quest, only that I realized that there is not necessarily a unit in a magma so we do not have $x \mathrel{R} x$ which is a requirement, well let's just throw those in too then I thought. Which is the reflexive closure of $R$, that is $\text{Cl}_\text{ref}(R)$ from before. Next I thought about transitivity which is required and I got absolutely nowhere there in my attempts primarily because I could not find anyway to proceed after setting up the equalities with elements and all. I pretty much felt it was impossible so I figured ""Let's just do the congruence closure and call it a day"" $\text{Cl}_\text{cng}(R)$. Which would of course be a congruence by the very definition but I feel it's a bit ""cheap"" so to speak. And quite frankly I am not entirely certain that it will yield satisfactory results. So the question is more ""is there a way to make a magma associative that is better than this?"".","['congruence-relations', 'abstract-algebra', 'magma', 'semigroups', 'relations']"

1954739,Trace in Riemannian geometry,"The first time I met the definition of the trace of the Ricci curvature $Ric$ on a Riemannian manifold (M^n,g), it was formulated thanks to local orthonormal coordinates: if $(x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n})$ are local orthonormal coordinates (i.e. $g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i},\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right)=\delta_{ij}$), then the trace of $Ric$ is $$Ric\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i},\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)$$ using the Eistein summation convention.
Then I met an other definition. If $g=g_{ij}dx^i dx^j$ in local coordinates (note necessarly orthonormal), $$Tr_{g}(Ric)=g^{ij}Ric_{ij},$$ where $g^{ij}$ is the $(i,j)$ coefficient of the inverse of the matrix $(g_{ij})_{1\le i,j \le n}$.

My idea is the following: Let $(X^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\subseteq\mathcal M_\infty^2$ be Cauchy $\mathcal M_{t_0}^2$ is complete $\Rightarrow$ $\exists Y^{t_0}\in\mathcal M_{t_0}^2$ with $$\left\|(X_t^n)_{t\in[0,\:t_0]}-Y^{t_0}\right\|_{\mathcal M_{t_0}^2}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\tag 3$$ for all $t_0\ge 0$ It's easy to see that $Y^{s_0}$ and $(Y_t^{t_0})_{t\in[0,\:s_0]}$ are indistinguishable, i.e. $$\left\|Y^{s_0}-(Y_t^{t_0})_{t\in[0,\:s_0]}\right\|_{\mathcal M_{s_0}^2}=0\;,\tag 4$$ for all $t_0\ge s_0\ge 0$ Now, let $$X_t:=Y_t^t\;\;\;\text{for }t\ge 0$$ Then, $$\left\|(X_t^n)_{t\in[0,\:t_0]}-(X_t)_{t\in[0,\:t_0]}\right\|_{\mathcal M^2_{t_0}}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\;\;\;\text{for all }t_0\ge 0\tag 5$$ However, we need to conclude that $$\left\|X^n-X\right\|_{\mathcal M^2_\infty}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\;.\tag 6$$ Note that $(6)$ would yield $X\in\mathcal M_\infty^2$ by the triangle inequality. So, how can we show $(6)$? $^1$ I don't see where we need the separability of $E$. Maybe someone can write the reason for this assumption into the comment section. $^2$ i.e. $$\sup_{t\ge 0}\left\|X_t\right\|_{\mathcal L^2(\operatorname P,\:E)}<\infty\;.$$","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'martingales']"
1954852,Entropy of the multinomial distribution,"What is the entropy of the multinomial distribution? To fix notation, let us define $n > 0$ as the number of trials, $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ as the probabilities of each of the $k$ possible outcomes and $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ as the outcomes. Recall that the pmf of the multinomial distribution is given by $f(x; n,p) \equiv f(x_1,\ldots, x_k; n, p_1, \ldots, p_k) = \cases{ \frac{n!}{x_1! \ldots x_k!} p_1^{x_1} \ldots p_k^{x_k} \hspace{1cm} \text{if }\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i = 1 \\ 0 \hspace{4cm} \text{otherwise} }$ The (Shannon) entropy of a distribution measures the amount of stored information or the uncertainty and for this distribution takes the form $H = - \sum f(x; n,p) \log{f(x; n,p)} = E[-\log{f(x; n,p)}]$, where the sum is over all $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ for which $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = n$. The entropy for the binomial distribution can be calculated (see linked question). However, for the multinomial distribution it has only been shown that the entropy is maximized when $p_i = \frac{1}{k}$ for all $i$ [1, 2]. There is a recent paper [ 3 ] which sets upper and lower bounds on the entropy. However, a closed-form expression for the entropy seems not to have been derived yet. My questions are:
(A) Is there a closed form for the special case  $p_i = \frac{1}{k} \hspace{0.5cm} \forall i$ ?
(B) Are there other special cases for which the entropy can be calculated? 
(C) Why is it so difficult to obtain a closed-form solution for this? Linked questions Entropy of a binomial distribution References [ 1 ]: P. Mateev, On the entropy of a multinomial distribution, Teor.

I'm particularly interested in the case where $a,b,c$ may be infinite. If $c$ is finite, then either $a=b=1$ and $c=2$ or $R$ is not an integral domain (see here ). In any finite ring, prime ideals are maximal (because a finite integral domain is a field, see here ), so that possible examples for $a \neq b$ must be infinite. If $c=3$ , then $a=1$ (see here ). If $a=b$ and $c=2^a$ is finite, then I think that we can consider $R=\Bbb Z/p_1 \cdots p_a \Bbb Z$ where $p_1, \dots, p_a$ are distinct primes. I wasn't able to solve the case $c=5,a=b=3$ for instance. Maybe there are conditions on $a,b,c$ for such a ring to exist, at least when $c$ is finite. Possibly related: (1) , (2) , (3) .

1954938,Significance and application of Riesz Decomposition Theorem,"The Riesz Decomposition Theorem in Operator Theory is given as:
Let $a \in \mathcal{A}$ (for unital Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$) Suppose $\sigma(a) = \sigma_1 \cup \sigma_2$ where $\sigma_1 \cap \sigma_2 = \emptyset$. Then: $\exists$ non-trivial idempotents $E_1~,E_2 \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $E_1 + E_2 = 1$. If $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{L(X)}$ ($X$ Banach space) then $E_1X, ~E_2X$ are closed subspaces invariant  for $a$ and $E_1X \oplus E_2X = X$. If $a_k = aE_k$ then $\sigma(a_k) = \sigma_k$ (for $k=1,2$) and for any $f \in Hol(a)$ we have $$f(a_k) = f(a)E_k.$$ Question: What is the significance of these results, how is it most commonly used?

1954972,"If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, then the induced map $F:K(X)\to K(Y)$ is continuous wrt the Vietoris topology","Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces, $f:X\to Y$ a continuous map, and denote by $K(X)$ [resp. $K(Y)$] the set of compact subsets of $X$ [resp. $Y$]. We can endow $K(X)$ with a topology (the Vietoris topology) generated by the sets: $$\{K\in K(X): K\subset U\}$$ $$\{K\in K(X):K\cap U \neq\emptyset\}$$ where $U\subset X$ ranges on all open subsets of $X$. It is then natural to ask whether the induced map $F:K(X)\to K(Y)$ given by $F(K)=f[K]=\{f(x):x\in K\}$ is continuous. It suffices to see what happens to members of the sub-basis. Fixing $U$ open in $Y$, $F^{-1}(\{K:K\subset U\})=\{K:F(K)\subset U\}=\{K:f(K)\subset U\}=\{K:K\subset f^{-1}(U)\}$ which is obviously open in $K(X)$ since $U$ is open in $Y$ and $f$ is continuous. $F^{-1}(\{K:K\cap U\neq\emptyset\})=\{K:f(K)\cap U\neq\emptyset\}=\{K:K\cap f^{-1}(U)\neq\emptyset\}$. To see the last equality, note that:
$$f(K)\cap U\neq\emptyset \iff \exists y(y\in f(K)\wedge y\in U)\iff \exists x (x\in K\wedge f(x)\in U)$$
and
$$K\cap f^{-1}(U)\neq\emptyset \iff \exists x (x\in K\wedge f(x)\in U).$$ Is this correct?

1955070,Questions regarding definitions of reduction of structure group of a Principal/Fiber/Vector bundle?,"Let $P,B$ be algebraic varieties and $G$ be an algebraic group. Borel Construction :Let $p:P\rightarrow B$ be a principal $G$-bundle. Suppose $G$ acts on the left on a variety $F$. One can define a Borel Construction $P\times_G F$ to be the quotient of $P\times F/ \sim$ where $(x,f)\sim (xg,g^{-1}f)$. We have a natural projection from $q:P\times_G F\rightarrow X$ by defining $[x,f]\mapsto p(x)$. Then $q:P\times_G F\rightarrow X$  is a fiber bundle over $B$ with fiber $F$ and structure group $G$ which has the same transition function. Now let us start with a $q:Q\rightarrow B$ a principal $H$ bundle such that there is a morphism from $H\rightarrow G$. Take $F=H$, notice $H$ acts on $G$ from the left. Applying the Borel Construction  we get $p:Q\times_H G\rightarrow X$ a fibre bundle with fiber $G$ and structure group $H$, via the morphism $H\rightarrow G $ we can think the transition functions taking value in $G$. Hence we get a Principal $G$ bundle. Definition(Reduction of structure group): Given a principal $G$-bndle $p:E\rightarrow B$ we say that the structure group $G$ can be reduced to $H$ for some algebraic group $H$ with a morphism $H\rightarrow G$ if there exists a principal $H$-bundle $Q\rightarrow B$ and a $G$-equivariant morphism $\tau : Q\times_H G\rightarrow E$ so that the map is $\tau$ is $G$-equivariant. Question 1-Why don't we require $\tau$ to be an isomorphism? Question 2- Why cannot we simply say that ""Given a principal $G$-bndle $p:E\rightarrow B$ we say that the structure group $G$ can be reduced to $H$ if the transition functions factor through a map $U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}\rightarrow H$"" Question 3- One usually defines reduction of a structure group of a fiber bundle by defining it to be the reduction of the structure of group of the associated Principal bundle. If the 'definition' in Question-2 is a valid one, then one can define reduction of a structure group of a fiber bundle similar to that, that is the transition functions (or may be another set of equivalent transition fucntion) factors through $H$. Question 4- Bott and Tu defines a vector bundle to have reduction of structure group to $H$, if there is a equivalent transition function which takes values at $H$. But if we think a vector bundle as a fibre bundle, we have another definition- 'The vector bundle is said to have a reduced structure groupp $H$ if the associated Principal Bundle have a reduced structure group H.' Are these two definitions equivalent? Note: I am not demanding the action of the algebraic group $G$ on the fiber $F$ to  be faithful. So that I don't have to necessarily to talk about reduction of structure group into a subgroup f $G$.","['fiber-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'principal-bundles', 'vector-bundles']"
1955090,Double completion of measure space,"Let $(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$ be a measure space. The completion of $\mathscr{A}$ with respect to $\mu$ is defined as
$$\mathscr{A}_\mu :=\left\{A\subseteq X\mid \exists E,F\in \mathscr{A} : E\subseteq A\subseteq F, \mu(F\setminus E)=0 \right\}.$$
The completion of $\mu$ is defined as a function
$\overline{\mu}:\mathscr{A}_\mu\to[0,\infty]$ by
$$\overline{\mu}(A) :=\sup\left\{\mu(B)\mid B\in\mathscr{A}:B\subseteq A\right\}.$$
The triple $(X,\mathscr{A}_\mu,\overline{\mu})$ now forms a complete measure space. I am trying to show that if we again complete this completion, we obtain the same measure space. Specifically, I am trying to show that $(\mathscr{A}_\mu)_{\overline{\mu}}=\mathscr{A}_\mu$ (and $\overline{\overline{\mu}}=\overline{\mu}$). My observations so far: The inclusion $\mathscr{A}_\mu\subseteq(\mathscr{A}_\mu)_{\overline{\mu}}$ follows easily. So, suppose that $A\in (\mathscr{A}_\mu)_{\overline{\mu}}$. Then we can find $E,F\in\mathscr{A}_\mu$ so that $E\subseteq A\subseteq F$ and $\overline{\mu}(F\setminus E)=0$. We need to find two sets $E', F'\in\mathscr{A}$ so that $E'\subseteq A\subseteq F'$ and $\mu(F'\setminus E')=0$. Since $E,F\in \mathscr{A}_\mu$ we can find $E_1,E_2,F_1,F_2\in\mathscr{A}$ so that $$E_1\subseteq E\subseteq E_2 \quad \text{and}\quad\mu(E_2\setminus E_1)=0,$$
and
$$F_1\subseteq F\subseteq F_2 \quad\text{and}\quad\mu(F_2\setminus F_1)=0.$$ 
We now have the chain of inclusions $E_1\subseteq E\subseteq A\subseteq F\subseteq F_2$. Setting $E'=E_1$ and $F'=F_2$ seems the obvious next step, but then we need to show that $\mu(F_2\setminus E_1)=0$. However, I don't see why this should be true. On the other hand, we may set $E'=E_1\cup F_1$ and $F'=E_2\cup F_2$, so that
$$0\leq \mu((E_2\cup F_2)\setminus(E_1\cup F_1))\leq \mu((E_2\setminus E_1)\cup (F_2\setminus F_1)) \leq 0.$$
But now $E_1\cup F_1$ may not be contained in $A$, because $F_1$ may not be contained in $A$. We may modify our choice to $E'=E_1\cap F_1$, which is contained in $A$. However, now: 
$$\mu((E_2\cup F_2)\setminus (E_1\cap F_1))\leq \mu(E_2\setminus F_1) + \mu(F_2\setminus E_1),$$
which does not tell us anything because the terms on the right hand side are unknown. I am a bit stuck. Perhaps another possible approach would be using the fact that $B\in\mathscr{A}_\mu$ if and only if $\mu_\ast(B)=\mu^\ast(B)$, where $\mu_\ast$ and $\mu^\ast$ are the inner- and outer measures induced by $\mu$, respectively. Any hints would be greatly appreciated!",['measure-theory']
