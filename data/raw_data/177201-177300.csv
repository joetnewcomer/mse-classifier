3193641,"Does this type of ODE satisfies unicity? ( right hand side f(t,y) = g(t) y, with g in L1 )","I have the following ordinary differential equation on $(0,1)$ $$
\dot y(t) = g(t) y(t) \quad \text{ almost everywhere in } (0,1)
$$ Where $g(t)$ only satisfies being integrable ( $\int_0^1 |g(x)|dx < \infty $ ) and we are looking for absolutely continuous solutions $y(t)$ on $[0,1]$ . (so, as a consequence, the solutions we look for are bounded). The standard Picard's existence and unicity theorem requires $g(t)$ to be continuous, which is not the case in here. Can I ensure uniqueness of solution? It is easy to see that the zero function is a solution, similarly, if I have a solution and an interval $[t_0,t]$ such that $y(s) \neq 0$ , has constant sign for all $s \in [t_0,t]$ , then it is also easy to see that $$
y(s) = y(t_0) e^{\int_{t_0}^s g(x)dx }. 
$$ With this formula, I can extend such solution over the whole interval $(0,1)$ and notice that it would never touch the $0$ , since, for that to happen, the integral above the exponential has to value $-\infty$ ; which doesn't happens because $g$ is integrable. But I'm unsure on how to claim unicity of solution, as in, for some misterious $g$ , a wild solution could emerge from 0.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
3193666,Hungerford Chapter 2 Section 2 Problem 2 WITHOUT using the structure theorem of finite abelian groups,"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $x$ an element of maximal order. Show that $\langle x \rangle$ is a direct summand of $G$ . Use this to obtain another proof of Theorem 2.1.

3193668,Complex Number: $\frac{(3+i)^2}{(1+2i)^2}$ - cannot arrive at textbook solution,"I have a complex quotient $\frac{(3+i)^2}{(1+2i)^2}$ The solution provided in my textbook is $-2i$ . I arrived at different solutions and I'd like to know where I went wrong. Till now in my textbook chapter I have been working with the complex number i ( $\sqrt{-1}$ ). I understand that one cannot divide by a complex number in the denominator so I must multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate. However, for this exercise I'm confused since my expression is nested inside parenthesis and is squared. So, if for example my denominator was just $1+2i$ I know that the complex conjugate would be $1-2i$ . So I'm confused about what do do since the whole denominator is within parenthesis and squared. Just using what I know I tried solving for the squared term in both numerator and denominator: $(3+i)^2$ = $3^2+i^2$ = $9-1$ = $8$ For the denominator: $(1+2i)^2$ = $1^2+2^2i^2$ = $1+4 * -1$ = $1-4$ = $-3$ Then I would arrive at $\frac{8}{-3}$ which is not the solution. How can I arrive at $-2i$ ?",['algebra-precalculus']

3193796,MLE of simultaneous exponential distributions,"Given the $X_i\sim \text{exp}({\theta})$ and $Y_i\sim \text{exp}(\frac{1}{\theta})$ , where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are indpendent, with the same $\theta>0$ . I have to find the MLE and its distribution. I find the simultaneous distribution to be: $$f_{X_i,Y_i}(x,y)=e^{-\left(\frac{x_i}{\theta }+\theta  y_i\right)}1_{(0,\infty )}(x_i)1_{(0,\infty )}(y_i),$$ and the Fisherinformation: $$i_n(\theta)=\frac{2 n}{\theta ^2}$$ As it's convex, the maximum of the loglikelihood must be a minima, so I find the MLE: $$\hat{\theta}=\left(\frac{X_{\bullet }}{Y_{\bullet }}\right)^{0.5},$$ where $X_{\bullet }=\sum _{i=1}^n x_i$ and $Y_{\bullet }=\sum _{i=1}^n y_i$ . So the asymptotic distribution is: $$\hat{\theta}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\theta ,\frac{\theta^2}{2n^2}\right),$$ as $\hat{\theta}\approx\mathcal{N}\left(\theta,\frac{1}{ni_n(\theta)}\right),$ where $i_\theta$ is the Fisherinformation.

3193798,Is the warped product: $dr^{2} + r^{2} \gamma$ always flat in 3 dimensions?,"Suppose you have a Riemannian 2-sphere $(S^{2} , \gamma)$ . Define a metric $g$ on $M = S^{2} \times [1,\infty)$ in this way: If $(x_{1}, x_2)$ is a coordinate chart on $S^{2}$ then $$g = dr^{2} + r^{2}\gamma_{ij}dx^i dx^j$$ Where $i,j = 1,2$ . Notice that $\gamma_{ij}$ does not depend on $r$ and so this is a warped product. My question is: is this metric flat? And is this metric the Euclidean metric on $M$ ? Let us fix a coordinate chart on $S^{2}$ call it $(\theta, \phi) \in U$ where $U$ is some open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Then we are looking at $(U\times [1,\infty) , g)$ where $g = dr^2 + \tilde{\gamma}$ where $\tilde{\gamma} = r^2 \gamma$ . I think this means that the hypersurfaces $\{ r = r_{0} \}$ are all totally umbilical since the second fundamental form $K$ satisfies: $$K_{ij} = -\frac12 \frac{d}{dr} \tilde{\gamma} = -\frac1r \tilde{\gamma} $$ So the principle curvatures are $-\frac1r $ and so the Gaussian curvature is $\frac{1}{r^2} $ . Using this, I computed the Rici curvature components of M and found them to be $0$ (But I don’t trust my computations at all). This implies that the Rieman curvature tensor vanishes on $M$ and so $M$ is flat (since the Weyl part of Rieman curvature tensor vanishes for 3-dim manifolds, the vanishing of the Ricci curvature implies the vanishing of the Rieman Curvature tensor).

Does this mean numbers such that $0.x_1x_2x_3\dotso x_n$ such that $n$ can only be a $0$ or a $1$ ? So for example, $0.11$ and $0.101$ would be okay but not $0.21$ (as an example)? Does have this decimal expansion change the fact that the open interval is uncountable? Because if it were to be countable, then we should be able to list all its elements with no double listing.

Now consider $S_5$ , it has order $120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5$ . Take a Sylow- $2$ subgroup $H$ of $S_5$ . Sylow theory tells us that $|H| = 2^3 = 8$ . Now any $4$ -cycle in $S_5$ has order $4 = 2^2$ . So any $4$ -cycle in $S_5$ must be contained in $H$ . But the number of $4$ -cycles in $S_5$ is $\frac{5!}{(5-4)!4} = \frac{120}{4} = 30$ , so $S_5$ has at least $30$ elements of order $4$ all of which must be contained in $H$ which has order $8$ , an obvious contradiction.

3193972,Exponential decay of the gradient if the function itself and the Laplacian have exponential decay,"Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be twice continously differentiable.

My question is, whether this is still true in higher dimension in the following version Is the following statement true: If $f$ and $\Delta f$ have exponential decay, then $\nabla f$ has exponential decay as well (I guess that it holds true if we have the full Hessian instead of just the Laplacian using again Taylor's theorem). Anyway, I would already be happy to know the answer for $n=3$ (also if you want to assume another continuous derivative or two, be my guest. Even assuming $f$ to be smooth would be fine for me). Even the radial case would be fine. However, even there I don't see how to do it.

3194064,"If the probability of a dog barking one or more times in a given hour is 84%, then what is the probability of a dog barking in 30 minutes?","Poorly worded title but I don't know what the nature of this probability question is called. I was asked a question:
If the probability of a dog barking one or more times in a given hour is 84%, then what is the probability of a dog barking in 30 minutes? Since I was told that the first solution I wanted to jump to of 42% is incorrect, I was then presented with the following steps: The chance of the dog not barking in a given hour is 1-84% = 16% If the chance of a dog not barking over the course of 2 units - 2 half hours for a total of one hour, then x * x = 16%. Thus, the probability that the does does NOT bark in 30 minutes is $\sqrt{16%}$ = 40%. Therefore, the probability of the dog barking in a given 30 minutes is 1-40% = 60%. Question1: Is this correct? Question2: Rather than work with the inverse probability 16%, surely I can apply the same logic with just 84% and arrive at the same answer? So, if the probability of the dog barking one or more times in an hour is 84%, then this 84% could also be represented as the probability of two 30 minute instances of a dog barking at least once in each instance. In that case: p(dog barks in 1st half hour AND dog barks in second half hour) = 84%. Thus the chance of the dog barking in the first half hour is is $\sqrt{0.84}$ = 91.65%. 91.65% does not equal 60% which is what I arrived at by going the negative probability route. I was expecting both numbers to match. What is the correct way to calculate the probability of a dog barking over 30 minutes if we know that the probability of the dog barking over an hour is 84%?",['probability']
3194075,Find a remainder when $(x^5+1)^{100} + (x^5-1)^{100}$ is divided by $x^4+x^2+1$,"The question is: Find a remainder when $f(x)=(x^5+1)^{100} + (x^5-1)^{100}$ is divided by $x^4+x^2+1$ I first began by decomposing $$x^4+x^2+1=(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1)$$ and using $$x^3-1=(x-1)(x^2+x+1)\\x^3+1=(x+1)(x^2-x+1)$$ and could get remainders when divided by each factors. \begin{align}
(x^5+1)^{100}&\equiv(x^2+1)^{100}&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^3-1)\\
&\equiv(-x)^{100}&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^2+x+1)\\
&=x^{100}=x\cdot(x^3)^{33}\\
&\equiv x&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^3-1)\\\\
(x^5-1)^{100}&\equiv(x^2-1)^{100}&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^3-1)\\
&=(x+1)^{100}(x-1)^{100}\\
&=(x^2+x+1+x)^{50}\cdot(x^2+x+1-3x)^{50}\\
&\equiv x^{50}\cdot(-3x)^{50}&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^2+x+1)\\
&=3^{50}(x^2)^{50}=3^{50}x\cdot(x^3)^{33}\\
&\equiv 3^{50}x&(\mathrm{mod}\,x^3-1)\\
\end{align} Therefore $$f(x)\equiv (3^{50}+1)x\quad(\mathrm{mod}\,x^2+x+1)\\$$ Similarly, $$f(x)\equiv -(3^{50}+1)x\quad(\mathrm{mod}\,x^2-x+1)\\$$ So \begin{align}
f(x) &= (x²+x+1)p(x) + (3^{50}+1)x\\
f(x) &= (x²-x+1)q(x) - (3^{50}+1)x
\end{align} As $f(x)$ is an even function, I could derive that $$q(x)=p(-x)$$ And then, my plan was to find a remainder when $p(x)$ is devided by $x²-x+1$ and so on \begin{align}
p(x)&=(x²-x+1)A(x)+Cx+D\\
q(x)&=(x²+x+1)B(x)+Ex+F\\
\end{align} So that I could conclude that $$f(x)\equiv (x^2+x+1)(Cx+D)+(3^{50}+1)x\quad(\mathrm{mod}\,x^4+x^2+1)\\$$ Using $p(x)=q(-x)$ , I could derive that $A(x)=B(-x)$ , $C=-E$ , and $D=F$ . And further using $f(x)=f(-x)$ , I could do \begin{align}
p(x)&=e(x)+o(x)\quad(e(x)=e(-x)\,,o(x)=-o(-x))\\
\rightarrow&(x²+x+1)(e(x)+o(x)) + (3^{50}+1)x = (x²-x+1)(e(x)-o(x)) - (3^{50}+1)x\\
\rightarrow&2xe(x)+(x²+1)o(x) + 2(3^{50}+1)x = 0\\
p(x)&=\frac{(-x²+2x-1)o(x)}{2x} - (3^{50}+1) = \frac{(-x²+x-1 + x)o(x)}{2x} - (3^{50}+1)\\
&= \frac{(-x²+x-1)o(x)}{2x} + \frac{o(x)}2 - (3^{50}+1)

Obviously every single triangular side on a tetrahedron ""meets flush"" with every single other side. Or, another way of putting it, the object can be constructed without holes or cuts. The question comes when I had to determine whether I could construct an irregular triangular-base pyramid using 4 clones of a given isosceles, scalene, or right triangle instead of an equilateral triangle. When I've tried to do this on paper using a net I could never fold it so that all the sides met uniformly without holes or cuts. To see what I mean take the net of a tetrahedron . What if all triangles in the net were the same dimensions as each-other but irregular instead of equilateral? Could they be moved around so that when you folded them along their sides they'd produce an irregular pyramid? I don't feel like this is always possible.

As far as I could see, there is no closed form expressions. So, as I did in the linked question, I  used  Bhaskara I's approximation (for $-\frac \pi 2 \leq x\leq\frac \pi 2$ ) $$\cos(x) \simeq\frac{\pi ^2-4x^2}{\pi ^2+x^2}\implies \cos\left(\frac{p\,\pi}{2k}\right)=\frac{4 \left(k^2-p^2\right)}{4 k^2+p^2}$$ and then computed $$B_p=\prod _{k=p+1}^{\infty }\frac{4 \left(k^2-p^2\right)}{4 k^2+p^2}=\frac{\Gamma \left( p+1-i\frac p 2\right)\,\, \Gamma
   \left( p+1+i\frac p 2\right)}{(2p)!}\tag 2$$ which does not seem to be very bad (see the table below). Using Stirling approximation and Taylor series for supposed large values of $p$ , I ended with $$\log(B_p)=\frac 12\log \left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)-\left(\log \left(\frac{16}{5}\right)+\cot ^{-1}(2)\right)p+\frac 12 \log(p)+\frac{11}{120 p}+O\left(\frac{1}{p^3}\right)\tag 3$$ What is interesting is to notice that $$\log \left(\frac{16}{5}\right)+\cot ^{-1}(2)\approx 1.62680$$ which is not so far from $\frac \pi 2$ ( $3.56$ % relative difference) and this already bring questions (at least, to me).

Also, since $n<k$ , there are no $k \times k$ submatrices of $A$ to consider. Thus, both sides of (*) are 0.

After our selection, the host, who knows what's behind the doors reaveals one of the other two doors that has a goat. Now we are asked if we want to change our mind or stay with our initial pick. According to Probabilities, if we don't swap and keep our first selection we get $(1/3)$ $33.3\% $ chance of wining the car since the elimination of the door that was opened by the host doesn't affect the probability of our door having the car which remains $33.3\%$ as it is at the initial problem. On the other hand, if we switch the door with the other one left , then we get $(2/3)$ $66.6\%$ chances of wining the car since only two doors are remaining and the fact that the host revealed a goat in one of the unchosen doors changed nothing about the initial probability of our door having the car. Till this point it makes pretty much sense to me. But what about assuming we have a man in the audience that makes a different initial choice in his head. For instance, let's say that the contestant picked door number $1$ and he picked door number $2$ . If door number $3$ is the door that is being revealed by the host (has a goat) then both doors $1$ and $2$ remain in the game. For the contestant door number $2$ has $66.6\%$ chances of having the car when for the man in the audience door number $1$ has $66.6\%$ chances of having the car. Isn't that weird?

$$ A few remarks: That $d_r(as,at)\le d_r(s,t)$ is obvious, the converse less so. If $n\gt 0$ and $d_r(as,at)=1$ then $d_r(s,t)=1$ . If $n\gt 0$ and $a$ does not occur in $s,t$ , then it must return at the initial position at some point. Therefore, the same reversal operations that transform $as$ into $at$ can be easily adjusted to transform $s$ into $t$ , so that the relative positions between all the other symbols excluding $a$ remain the same. This implies the conjecture in this case. Induction alone doesn't seem to be powerful enough. Also, most results I've found in the literature either provide lower/upper bounds on the minimum $k$ , or concern the computational complexity of this kind of problems, collectively known as sorting by reversals . I tested it via computer on random instances up to a reasonably high $n$ and it seems to hold. I've edited this question numerous times, mainly to consider some variation of the conjecture. We write $s\to^k t$ if $s$ can be transformed into $t$ by application of exactly $k$ reversals: Assume $i\lt j$ (i.e. $\text{r}(i,i)$ are disallowed). Prove that if $as\to^k at$ then $s\to^k t$ .

If true, how might I go about proving this? For my attempt, I'm not quite sure how to approach this, all I have are some experimental results to validate the conjecture. I started with $\sqrt2$ . The occurrences of the various digits in the first 5,916 decimal terms are: 563, 581, 575, 579, 585, 608, 611, 565, 637, 612. And here are the occurrences of the decimals in the first 1993 digits of $\pi$ : 180, 212, 206, 188, 195, 204, 200, 196, 202, 210 Same for the first 9825 digits of $e$ : 955, 971, 993, 991, 968, 974, 1056, 990, 975, 952 It does seem that the percentage representations of each digit is very close to 10% in all cases. Edit: It's clear the conjecture is false (thanks for the answers). Still curious why all ""naturally ocurring"" irrational numbers (like the ones mentioned here) do appear to be normal. I know this is unproven, so feel free to provide conjectures.","['number-theory', 'irrational-numbers', 'transcendental-numbers', 'decimal-expansion']"

When the convergence is uniform by the Weierstrass test (i.e., $\sum\left|c_n\right|<\infty$ ), I can show that $f$ is continuous. When the series of derivatives converges uniformly ( $\sum\left|nc_n\right|<\infty$ ), I can show that $f$ is differentiable. However, very often I plot the series, and $f$ looks clearly continuous and/or $C^1$ (sometimes piecewise, sometimes globally), but I can't prove it. What are some other tools, besides these basic theorems/tests I mentioned above? Context: I want to show that $$f\left(x\right) = \sum_{n\geqslant 2} \frac{1-\cos nx}{n^2 \log n}$$ is $C^1$ . It's enough to define $$g\left(x\right) = \sum_{n\geqslant 2} \frac{\sin nx}{n \log n},$$ show that this series converges (easy: Dirichlet test), $g$ is continuous (hard), and then integrate it (easy again). When I plot the graph, this series looks like it's uniformly convergent, but I have no idea how to show this. I would by satisfied with a proof that it is continuous at $x=0$ , and that it conveges uniformly on any compact set away from zero. I can't show either of these things. My only clue is: I know that $\sum \left(\sin nx\right)/n$ is the sawtooth, which is discontinuous at zero, but with limits at the right and at the left.

The comments below won't make any sense. In fact, my original question has been answered by Eric Wolfsey, so I may restore it.] When you read about the quaternions on Wikipedia and on many other sources, they are defined with the relation $$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$ This comes across as completely random. There is no explanation of where this relation comes from. These sources then go on to prove that the quaternions satisfy various algebraic and geometric properties. Among these properties, they act on 3D vectors as rotations (but as a double-covering), they act on 4D space as rotations, they're associative, they're distributive. Etc. All of this comes across as a random coincidence when you compare it to the defining relation. Some of the time quaternions are thought of as 3D rotations. But this is a lossy interpretation, as a quaternion $q$ and its negation $-q$ represent the same rotation. For similar reasons, addition of quaternions starts to seem more bizarre. When defined as 4D rotations, they happen to be an ""isoclinic rotation"". I haven't thought enough about this concept... When defined as a complex matrix that satisfies a linear algebra relationship (sourced from here: https://qchu.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/su2-and-the-quaternions/ ), closure under multiplication is baked in, but closure under addition comes across as a coincidence. This relation is: $$M\text{ is a $2\times2$ matrix over $\mathbb C$}, M^\dagger M \in \mathbb R, \det(M) \geq 0 $$ Geometric Algebra textbooks show that they're an instance of a larger family of algebras with similar interpretations, called Geometric Algebra (or Clifford Algebras).

Before the calculation, agree with some convention.
Let us denote $a\; \mathrm{mod}\; b$ for the remainder of $a$ modulo $b$ (so that $9\; \mathrm{mod}\; 4 =1$ ).
This is unlike the usual practice, but otherwise the expression gets too verbose.
Moreover let us denote the $(i,j)$ -th entry of $A$ to be $A_{i,j}$ , and $i$ -th entry of $v$ to be $v_{i}$ .
Also say that $A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \cdot N}$ if it is a $M$ by $N$ matrix, by slightly abusing the meaning of $\mathbb{R}$ .
If we stick to only addition and multiplication, once the proof works, it works for any field. Firstly, restate the formal definition of Kronecker product and vectorization, for later use.
For $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{N_2 \cdot N_3}$ $$\begin{align}

\end{align}$$ Now, let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \cdot N_2},\; X \in \mathbb{R}^{N_2 \cdot N_3},\; B \in \mathbb{R}^{N_3 \cdot N_4},$ ,

Although $A$ 's row index $m_1\; \mathrm{mod}\; N_1$ and $B$ 's column index $\lceil m_1/N_1 \rceil$ agree, the other do not.

3196260,Why do we take magnitude into account when calculating the directional derivative?,"Given that the directional derivative is defined formally as: $$
\nabla_\vec{v}\, f\left(\vec{x}\right) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\left(\vec{x} + h\vec{v}\right) - f\left(\vec{x}\right)}{h|\vec{v}|}
$$ It's not exactly clear why the magnitude should matter here if we are taking some step $h\vec{v}$ if $h \to 0$ . If the directional derivative can be calculated via $\nabla f\left(\vec{x}\right) \cdot \vec{v}$ , any scalar to $\vec{v}$ will arbitrarily scale the magnitude of the directional derivative - but if we take the limit definition, shouldn't magnitude not matter as we are investigating how $f$ changes with some infinitesimal movement in the direction of $\vec{v}$ ? One explanation was to imagine a function $f(x, y)$ representing the altitude via a surface, with a person moving around it. If a person were to move with double the velocity in a certain direction, they should have double to amount in change of height. But I can't reconcile this with the formal definition: why should doubling the velocity change how much $f$ changes if you move infinitesimally in the direction of the velocity?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

I have an idea as if I use a a 3-tuple to represent $(a,b,c)$ , I can list all of them using two functions $f((a,b,c)) = (a-2,b+1,c)$ and $g((a,b,c)) = (a-1,b-1,c+1)$ .

State whether the origin is a stable or unstable equilibrium. So we want to find $a,b$ where $L(x,y)$ is a Lyapunov function, and then determine the stability of the equilibria. First differentiate: $\frac{dL}{dt}=2axx'+2byy'$ Now plug in system: $2ax(-x^3+7xy^2)+2by(-3x^2y+y^3)$ By checking the equilibria, we see that both $x'$ and $y'$ equal zero only when $(x,y)=(0,0)$ . Therefore we need to find when $2ax(-x^3+7xy^2)= -2by(-3x^2y+y^3)$ This is where I am confused, as I am not sure how to find $a$ or $b$ purely in terms of $x,y$ and what restrictions I may need to impose.

3196337,Typical Calculus BC Separation of Variables Question,"I was told that I have a cylindrical water tank $10$ ft tall that can store $5000 $ ft $^3$ of water, and that the water drains from the bottom of the tank at a rate proportional to the instantaneous water level. After $6$ hours, half of the tank has drained out from the bottom. If the drain is opened and water is added to the tank at a constant rate of $100$ $\frac{ft^3}{hr}$ , at what height above the drain will the elevation remain constant? My attempt: We are given that $$\frac{dV}{dt}=kh$$ where $\frac{dV}{dt}$ is the rate at which water leaves the tank, $V$ is the total change in water that has left the tank,  and $h$ is the water's height above the drain. If the elevation must remain constant in the tank, then I am merely finding the height in which the water that enters the tank equals to the water that leaves the tank, and therefore $\frac{dV}{dt}=100\frac{ft^3}{hr}$ . To find $k$ , I must do separation of variables and integrate both sides, so: $$\int{dV}=\int{khdt}$$ $$V=kht+C$$ I know that $C=0$ because at $t=0$ hr, no water has left the tank ( $V=0$ ), and at $t=6$ hr, $V=2500$ ft $^3$ and $h=5$ ft, since half the tank has drained out. Solving for $k$ : $$2500=k(5)(6)+0$$ $$k=\frac{250}{3}$$ And solving for $h$ when $\frac{dV}{dt}=100\frac{ft^3}{hr}$ : $$100=\frac{250}{3}h$$ $$h=1.2ft$$ However, the answer is actually about $1.73ft$ .

However, there's a part of the proof I can't wrap my head around. Let X be a completely metrizable space with a compatible metric d, and Y a $G_\delta$ subset of X. As such, Y can be written as $\cap_n U_n$ , where the $U_n$ are open in X.

Kechris then states that it is easy to show that d' generates the same topology as d. This is not obvious to me.

This intrigued me, so I decided to investigate. My findings and questions are below. Reproducing it in Desmos: (for those interested) I first decided to recreate the picture on Desmos. You can see it here (it will take a while to load). I created the image by defining $f(x)$ as it is defined above, then setting $$
x_2(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{x}\cos(2\pi f(k))\\
y_2(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{x}\sin(2\pi f(k))\\
p(x)=(x_2(x),y_2(x))
$$ So that $p(x)$ was essentially $\sum_{k=1}^{x}e^{2\pi i f(k)}$ . Then I defined the lists $$\begin{align}
I_1&=[1,2,\dots,1000]\\
I_2&=[1001,1002,\dots,2000]\\
\dots &\dots\\
I_{10}&=[9001,9002,\dots,10000]
\end{align}$$ Then entering $p(I_{1}),\ p(I_2),\ \text{etc.}$ gave a whole bunch ( $10000$ to be precise) of points. Then clicking the little gear symbol and then the colored circle next to each entry (on the left) I was able to connect the points $p(i)$ and $p(i+1)$ for any integer $1\leq i\leq 9999$ . I used the $10$ different lists instead of $1$ in order to keep Desmos from freaking out. My investigations: Also using Desmos and the same technique as described above, I decided to create the graphs corresponding to the functions $$H_n(x)=x+\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}3+\dots+\frac{x^n}n\qquad (n>1)$$ i.e. I made the graphs for $$p(k)=\left(\sum_{r=1}^{k}\cos[2\pi H_n(r)],\sum_{r=1}^{k}\sin[2\pi H_n(r)]\right)$$ I made each sequence/graph have $700$ points (AKA I graphed $p([1,2,...,700])$ ) just to see if any irregular behavior started to occur. Here are the graphs for the first $6$ values of $n$ . $n=2$ : $n=3$ : $n=4$ : $n=5$ : I do not know how well you can see it, but the points are starting to move around a little. This is a picture of the $n=5$ graph when I zoomed in on one of the corners: $n=6$ : Needless to say, the wiggly effect has been amplified. For comparison, here's the $n=6$ graph of $p([1,2,...,31])$ : $n=7$ : Which is very far from well behaved. I think its 'supposed' to look something like the graph of $p([1,2,...,105])$ : Although even that has some drifty looking points. You can look at more of these graphs by changing the value of $n$ on this graph . Questions: At this point I'm fairly certain that the strange behavior (as demonstrated by the cases $n=5,6,7$ ) can be attributed to the accumulating numerical inaccuracies of Desmos. For example, Wolfram evaluates $$A=\sum_{r=1}^{700}\exp[2i\pi H_{7}(r)]$$ as $$A= -11.470821630307989891763598910658573978486117477630759175...\\ -
3.6768673678262517039383839969453158461799151084757854088... i$$ and provides a monstrous closed form . Whereas Desmos puts the sum at the wildly incorrect $$1.3535617164+9.88880050357i$$ I did the same sort of test with $B=\sum_{r=1}^{20}\exp[2i\pi H_5(r)]$ and Wolfram gave $$B=-6.3944653536668510841041628532095052345320229467766883302... \\+
1.0127838162151622424794134150036094634983505690619992502... i$$ And Desmos gave $$-6.39446535424+1.01278381623i$$ Which is conclusive evidence that Desmos gets less accurate as $n$ and $x$ grow. That was the subject of my original question, but it seems to have been resolved by now. So my question is how do we find a general formula for $\pi_n\in\Bbb N$ such that $$\forall k\in\Bbb N,\quad f_n(k+\pi_n)=f_n(k)$$ where $$f_n(k)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}\exp[2i\pi H_n(\ell)]$$ I found the first few values: $$\pi_2=2\\
\pi_3=6\\
\pi_4=6\\
\pi_5=30\\
\pi_6=30$$ But there's got to be some other way to do this. Any help is appreciated.","['periodic-functions', 'calculus', 'polynomials', 'sequences-and-series', 'complex-numbers']"
