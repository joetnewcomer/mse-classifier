348131,Diophantine equation $x^2 + 32x = y^3$,"I am trying to find all solutions to the Diophantine equation $x^2 + 32x = y^3$. I think that the first step is to factorise: $x(x+32)=y^3$. If $x$ is odd, then $x+32$ is also odd. The common divisors of $x$ and $x+32$ must divide 32, and since all the divisors of 32 are even except 1, then we must have gcd$(x,x+32)=1$. Therefore $x$ and $x+32$ are cubes, and since there are no cubes which are 32 apart, then there are no solutions when $x$ is odd. I am stuck on what to do when $x$ is even. Is the same approach the best way to do it, i.e. consider all the possible common divisors when $x$ is even?

We can define $\arctan \left(\frac{1}{s} \right)$ in terms of the complex logarithm.

348264,Integration for functions with values in a separable Banach space,"Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a measure space, $Y$ a separable Banach space, and $L_{Y}$ the space of all $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{B}_{Y})$-measurable maps from $X$ to $Y$ (where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes the Borel $\sigma$-algebra). Let $F_{Y}$ be the set of maps $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of the form $f(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\chi_{E_{j}}(x)y_{j}$ where $n\in\mathbb{N},y_{j}\in Y,E_{j}\in\mathcal{M}$, and $\mu(E_{j})<\infty$. If $f\in L_{Y}$, since $y\mapsto||y||$ is continuous, $x\mapsto||f(x)||$ is $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}})$-measurable, and we define $||f||_{1}=\int||f(x)||\;d\mu(x)$. FInally, let $L_{Y}^{1}=\{f\in L_{Y}:||f||_{1}<\infty\}$. This is a 6-part question in Folland's Real Analysis (problem 5.16). I've done the first two parts (which I will state below for reference) and I'm stuck with the third. (a) $L_{Y}$ is a vector space, $F_{Y}$ and $L_{Y}^{1}$ are subspaces of it, $F_{Y}\subset L_{Y}^{1}$, and $||\cdot||_{1}$ is a seminorm on $L_{Y}^{1}$ that becomes a norm if we identify two functions that are equal a.e. (b) Let $\{y_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a countable dense set in $Y$. Given $\varepsilon>0$, let $B_{n}^{\varepsilon}=\{y\in Y:||y-y_{n}||<\varepsilon||y_{n}||\}$. Then $\bigcup_{n}B_{n}^{\varepsilon}\supset Y\setminus\{0\}$. (c) If $f\in L_{Y}^{1}$, there is a sequence $\{h_{n}\}\subset F_{Y}$ with $h_{n}\rightarrow f$ a.e. and $||h_{n}-f||_{1}\rightarrow 0$. (With notation as in (b), let $A_{nj}=B_{n}^{1/j}\setminus\bigcup_{m=1}^{n-1}B_{m}^{1/j}$ and $E_{nj}=f^{-1}(A_{nj})$, and consider $g_{j}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}y_{n}\chi_{E_{nj}}$.)","['measure-theory', 'banach-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
348265,Not Riemann integrable derivative,"Is there a function $F:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ differentiable with $F' = f$ , but $f$ is not Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ . $[a,b]$ is a bounded interval? Motivation Rudin page 152 Theorem 7.17: Suppose $\{f_n\}$ a sequence of functions, differentiable on $[a,b]$ and such that $\{f_n(x_0)\}$ converges for some point $x_0\in [a,b]$ . If $\{f_n'\}$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$ to $g$ , then $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$ to $f$ where $f' = g$ . In the remark, it says if the continuity of the function $f'_n$ is assumed in addition to the above hypothesis, then a much shorter proof can be based on fundamental theorem of calculus and the theorem that $\int_a^b f_n d\alpha\to\int_a^b f d\alpha$ if we have $f_n\to f$ uniformly. I was thinking that we don't really need $f_n'$ to be continuous, we just need it to be Riemann integrable so we can apply Fundamental Thm of Calculus. From the remark I guess that there should be a derivative that is not integrable.

348374,What is the complex *algebraic* moduli of elliptic curves?,"It's well-known that $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathfrak{h}$ is a coarse moduli space for complex elliptic curves.  Thus, I would expect this to be related to the pullback of $\mathcal{M}_{ell} \rightarrow \mbox{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ along $\mbox{Spec}(\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow \mbox{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$; for instance, I might expect this pullback to look something like $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \! \! \backslash \mathfrak{h}$.  However, I'm pretty sure that $\mathfrak{h}$ isn't actually a complex variety (basically by the Riemann mapping theorem), so at best this would admit a map from the analytification of the actual algebro-geometric pullback. The answer might be bound up in the $j$-invariant; over $\mathbb{C}$, this is a ""biholomorphism"" $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathfrak{h} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, i.e. it is a holomorphic bijection of complex orbifolds.  (Around the cone points $i \in \mathfrak{h}$ and $\omega=e^{2 \pi i /3}\in \mathfrak{h}$, the map is locally modeled by $z \mapsto z^2$ and by $z \mapsto z^3$, respectively.)  This has always been sort of mysterious to me, but I think the point is just that ""biholomorphism"" is the wrong notion of equivalence for complex orbifolds; it seems somehow besides the point to me that we happen to have such an equivalence.","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'complex-analysis']"

For the second part, I have to show that if $n$ is odd then $K$ has no nontrivial subfields which are Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ and if $n$ is even then the only nontrivial subfield of $K$ which is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a})$ .

Is this going to be necessary in general, and if so, to what extent? That is, suppose a field $K$ is given, and we desire to show that $K$ is algebraically closed. Is there any amount of purely algebraic data (save that $K = F^{alg}$ for some field $F$) that will allow us to say that $K$ is algebraically closed? Of course, the phrase ""purely algebraic data"" isn't well-defined, but I loosely mean information about $K$ in relation to fields $E_i$ of which $K$ is an extension, such as the degrees of the extensions $K/E_i$, if $K = E_i(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in K$, their Galois groups $\operatorname{Gal}\left(K/E_i\right)$, what $\operatorname{char}K$ is, and so on (where this information isn't precisely the information that $K$ is constructed as the algebraic closure of some field). If this isn't possible, at what point does it become necessary to appeal to the topology and analysis of $K$ and $K[x]$, and how does this ""point"" depend on $K$? I realize that exactly how and where analysis and topology come into play for different $K$ will depend on the nature of the $K$ with which one is working, but I would be interested in knowing what properties of $K$ have the greatest effect on the necessity of analysis and topology in a proof that $K$ is algebraically closed. Of course, the more general these properties, the better. A note: this question deals with this idea to some extent, although the discussion there is more focused on $\Bbb{C}$, and I would like to consider a more general setting: the conditions required to show a certain type of field is algebraically closed, and how those conditions differ for different types of fields.","['general-topology', 'field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'analysis']"

The next problem I can think of is that we cannot really ""define"" the elements of empty set (to my knowledge, there is no element in empty set) so how can we then prove as the above proof did?

Are both series correct, or is it a methodical error on my part? I checked the derivatives using WolframAlpha, so I can't see it being computational. BY SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION:
To find coefficients of the power series, evaluate the function and it's successive derivatives at $x=0$ : $\arctan(0) =0$ $\arctan^{(1)}(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1}$ so $\arctan^{(1)}(0)= 1$ $\arctan^{(2)}(x) = -2x(1+x^2)^{-2}$ so $\arctan^{(2)}(0)= 0$ $\arctan^{(3)}(x) = (6x^2-2)(1+x^2)^{-3}$ so $\arctan^{(3)}(0) = -2$ $\arctan^{(4)}(x) = -24x(x^2-1)((1+x^2)^{-4}$ so $\arctan^{(4)}(0) = 0$ $\arctan^{(5)}(x) = 24(5x^4-10x^2+1)(1+x^2)^{-5}$ so $\arctan^{(5)}(0) = 24$ Which leads to the series $$x-2x^3+24x^5-\cdots$$ which captures the alternation of the series but the coefficients are all off.

(the real issue) For every $p>1$ there exists $g_p:[0,+\infty)\to[0,+\infty)$, a number $x_p\in[0,+\infty)$ and two constants $0<c_p<C_p<\infty$ such that $g_p$ is convex on $(x_p,\infty)$ and $c_pg_p(x)\leq f(x^p)\leq C_pg_p(x)$ for $x\in(x_p,\infty)$ (so $f$ and $g_p$ are equivalent at $\infty$).

The Gerontology Research Group keeps records: Guinness World Records. If you live in a country with $N_{\text{country}}$ people, a continent with $N_{\text{continent}}$ people, and a world with $N_{\text{world}}$ people, during a year and on average, how often will you be notified (if you're paying attention to your quality tabloid) of the death of the oldest man/woman/person alive of your country/continent/world? (Note that a death will result in at most one notification.) Edit, Suggestions (due to comments; thanks!) only: Ultimately, I am looking for a realistic formula. That means that life tables are certainly allowed (but mind the ending , and note that some of the oldest people are older than the maximum in the tables). I guess that the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality , or any plausible model of late-life mortality , is also fair game. However, these suggestions do not preclude some insight or realistic assumption that might not need any of those things. Further potentially useful assumptions (with regard to a subpopulation) may include (if reasonable w.r.t. the question): Time is discrete. The number of births at any time is constant. The number of deaths at any time is constant. The number of births is equal to the number of deaths at any time. Time is defined in such a way that, at any time, one birth and one death occur. In the limit to infinite age, the probability of a person of such age dying goes to $1$. At any time, the oldest person(s) alive is (are) the most likely to die. At any time, an older person(s) alive is (are) more likely to die than any younger person alive.

349278,PDE weak solution problem,"My professor grades really  strictly (details). I would be very happy if you could help me with this problem: Let $U \subset R^n$ be a bounded set. Consider $ \Delta^2 u = f$ on $U$ and $u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0$ on $\partial U$. Part (a): Prove Poincare inequality for $H_0^2(U)$, i.e. $\int_U u^2 dx \leq C\int_U |\Delta u|^2 dx$ for all $u \in H_0^2(U)$. Part (b): Define the notion of weak solution. Part (c): Let $f \in L^2(U)$. Show that the problem has a unique weak solution in an appropriately chosen Sobolev space. Part (d): Consider the same problem with boundary conditions $u=\Delta u = 0$ on $\partial U$ and prove the existence of a weak solution in the appropriate Sobolev space. My work: (a): $u \in H_0^2 (U) \subset H_0^1(U)$ and therefore we can use the Poincare inequality for $H_0^1$ $(\int_U u^2 dx \leq \widetilde{C} \int_U |Du|^2 dx)$ twice:
$$
\int_U u^2 dx \leq \widetilde{C} \int_U |Du|^2 dx \leq \widetilde{C} \widetilde{\widetilde{C}} \int_U |D^2u|^2 dx
$$
since $Du \in H_0^1 (U)$. (b): Multiply $\Delta^2 u = f$ on $U$ by a test function $v \in H_0^2(U)$ and integrate over $U$. Green's identity for operator $L= \Delta^2$: 
$$
\int_U v \Delta^2 u dx= \int_{\partial U} (v \frac{\partial \Delta u}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial n}\Delta u)dS + \int_U \Delta v \Delta u dx = \int_U \Delta v \Delta u dx.
$$
since $v$ is a test function and therefore the integral on the boundary vanishes. (i assumed $\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}= 0$. is this ok?) 
We can now define weak solution in the following way. Function $u \in H_0^2(U)$ is a weak solution if 
$$ B[u,v]:= \int_U \Delta v \Delta u dx = \int_U fv dx \textrm{ for any } v \in H_0^2(U). $$
The weak solution of our fourth order problem will lie in the Hilbert space $H_0^2(U)$. Do you agree? (c): Define an inner product on the Hilbert space $H_0^2(U)$:
$$ 
<u,v>_2 = \int_U \Delta u \Delta v dx
$$
which implies the norm 
$$ 
||u||_2 = (\int_U |\Delta u|^2 dx)^{\frac{1}{2}} = (\int_U |D^2 u|^2 dx)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
$$
Norm $||\cdot||_2$ is equivalent to the standard norm on $H_0^2$: $||u||_1 := \big( \int_U (u^2 + |Du|^2 + |D^2u|^2)dx  \big)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. It is obvious that $||u||_2 \leq ||u||_1$.
On the other hand,
\begin{align*}
||u||_1^2 &= \int_U (u^2 + |Du|^2 + |D^2u|^2 )dx\\
& = \int_U u^2dx + \int_U |Du|^2dx + \int_U |D^2u|^2 dx\\
& \leq C_1 \int_U |D^2u|^2dx + C_2 \int_U |D^2u|^2dx +  \int_U |D^2u|^2 dx\\
&= (1+C_1+C_2)||u||_2^2
\end{align*}
using Poincare inequalities as in (a). Define a linear functional $F_f \in H_0^{2*}(U)$:
$$F_f(v) = \int_U fv dx \quad (=<f,v>_{L^2}).$$
$F_f$ is bounded which follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Poincare inequality (is this ok?):
$$ |\int_U fv dx | \leq ||f||_{L^2}||v||_{L^2} \leq ||f||_{L^2}||v||_{H_0^2}.$$
Linearity is easy. Equip $H_0^2$ with the inner product $<,>_2$ .Apply Riesz representation theorem and you have weak solution. But is not that already a strong solution?

349421,Is this a valid proof of the derivatives of the trigonometric functions?,"For the sake of this proof, the trigonometric functions $\cos$ and $\sin$ are defined as the coordinates of a point on the unit circle, rather than any of the modern analytic definitions. Let $\vec x(\theta)$ be a function giving the position of a point on the unit circle as a function of the angle $\theta$, that is, $\vec x(\theta) = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
\cos(\theta)\\
\sin(\theta)\\
\end{array}
\right)$. Decompose $\vec x'(\theta)$ into a colinear and an orthogonal component with $\vec x(\theta)$. If the colinear component is non-null, then on the assumption that $\vec x'(\theta)$ is continuous ( could this be demonstrated? ), it would be non-null over some small interval ( right? ), and then by taking the integral over that interval, we would have that $\vec x(\theta)$ either moves away from or towards the center of the origin, which is contrary to our hypotheses. Thus the colinear component is always null, and $\vec x'(\theta)$ is always tangent to the circle. But for any vector $\left(
\begin{array}{c}
a\\
b\\
\end{array}
\right)$, a vector is orthogonal to it if and only if it is colinear with $\left(
\begin{array}{c}
-b\\
a\\
\end{array}
\right)$. Therefore $\vec x'(\theta) = k\left(
\begin{array}{c}
-\sin(\theta)\\
\cos(\theta)\\
\end{array}
\right)$ and we have $\cos' = -k\sin$, $\sin' = k\cos$, for some $k$. There are gaps in this proof (in italics), but are there ways of filling them in while remaining within the geometric definitions of the trigonometric functions? It would be pleasing to be able to prove the derivatives of the trig functions purely on the basis of the fairly obvious geometrical nature of circular motion.","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"
