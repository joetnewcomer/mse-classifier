3791868,Solving recursion by analogy with a differential equation,"I came across this problem: Let sequence $u_n$ be defined by its first term $u_0 > 0$ and $$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad u_{n+1} = u_n + \frac{1}{u_n}$$ Find an asymptotic formula for $u_n$ . I thought that we could solve it by analogy with the equation $$f' = \frac{1}{f}$$ which gives the asymptotic formula $u_n \sim \sqrt{2 n}$ , and this is indeed the right answer. More generally, is we take $u_0 > 0, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, u_{n+1} = u_n + f(u_n)$ , what would be the conditions on a continuous, positive, decreasing function $f$ such that the method of analogy with a differential equation gives the right asymptotic formula ?

3791880,Improper Definite integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty -\frac{i \pi e^{-i a p} \text{sech}\left(\frac{c p}{2}\right)}{p}dp$,"I came across this improper integral that I couldn't solve $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty -\frac{i \pi  e^{-i a p} \text{sech}\left(\frac{c p}{2}\right)}{p} dp$$ My guess would be to use Residue theorem but it does not seem help. My try so far is that it has a pole at $p=0$ . With $a>0$ , closing the contour upward, I compute the residue $$\lim_{p\to 0}-\frac{i \pi  e^{-i a p} \text{sech}\left(\frac{c p}{2}\right)}{p} p =-I \pi $$ Thus, the value of the integral is $2\pi I Res(f,0)= 2\pi^2$ . This is definitely not the correct answer (which I confirmed by numerical integration). Taking the hint from the comment I proceeded the following way $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-iap} sech(\frac{cp}{2})=\frac{2 \pi  \text{sech}\left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right)}{c}$ which comes from the fact that Fourier transform of sech function is sech function itself. Now, to account the p in the denominator, I need to integrate this result and add a delta function which gives $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{ e^{-i a p} \text{sech}\left(\frac{c p}{2}\right)}{p} dp =\int \frac{2 \pi  \text{sech}\left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right)}{c} da =-\frac{2 \pi ^2 \tanh \left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right) \text{sech}\left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right)}{c^2}+ \delta(a)$ Multiplying by the factor $-i\pi$ on both sides, I get $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty -\frac{i \pi  e^{-i a p} \text{sech}\left(\frac{c p}{2}\right)}{p} dp=\frac{2 i \pi ^3 \tanh \left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right) \text{sech}\left(\frac{\pi  a}{c}\right)}{c^2}-i\pi \delta (a)$$ This is supposed to be the correct answer. But that still does not match with the numerical integration.","['improper-integrals', 'definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'residue-calculus', 'complex-integration']"

(b) absolutely  convergent and it's sum is an irrational number. (c) absolutely  convergent and it's sum is a positive number. (d) none of the above. My attempt $:$ It is easy to see that $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1} {a_n}$ is absolutely convergent. Let $a_{k+1} = m_k\ a_{k},$ for $k \geq 1.$ By (I) it follows that $|m_k| \geq 2,$ for all $k \geq 1.$ So we have \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1} {|a_n|} & = \frac {1} {|a_1|} + \frac {1} {|a_2|} + \frac {1} {|a_3|} + \cdots \\ & = \frac {1} {|a_1|} + \frac {1} {|m_1|\ |a_1|} + \frac {1} {|m_2|\ |a_2|} + \cdots \\ & = \frac {1} {|a_1|} + \frac {1} {|m_1|\ |a_1|} + \frac {1} {|m_1|\ |m_2|\ |a_2|} + \cdots \\ & \leq \frac {1} {|a_1|} \left ( 1 + \frac {1} {2} + \frac {1} {2^2} + \cdots \right ) \\ & = \frac {2} {|a_1|} < \infty \end{align*} So $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1} {a_n}$ is absolutely convergent. Clearly (a) is false because we can take $a_n = n!,$ for all $n \geq 1.$ Then the sum is $e-1,$ which is clearly irrational. I may as well take $a_n = -n!,$ for all $n \geq 1.$ Which makes the sum $1-e,$ a negative quantity. Hence (c) is also false. But how can I conclude that whether the sum is always irrational or not? Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['sequences-and-series', 'absolute-convergence', 'real-analysis']"
3791954,Unexpectedly simple patterns for the determinants of some matrices,"Edit: ""Spoiler"" Since it's a pretty wordy question, here's a quick spoiler... Why is the following true? $$\det \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} =\det \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1\\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1\\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2\\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1  & 2 & 0 & 1\\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0& 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \dots $$ Consider the matrix $$A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\,.$$ It can be easily evaluated that $\det A = 4$ . More in general it's easy to show (by direct calculation) that given $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and defining $$A(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x-1 & x & x+1 \\ x & x-1 & x \\ x+1 & x & x-1\end{pmatrix}$$ then $\det A(x) = 4x$ . The interesting fact is that these matrices can be ""expanded"" in a way such that the determinant is invariant. Additionally, for a larger class of matrices there seems to be some ""simple"" regular patterns concerning the determinant. Introducing some notation... First, I need to introduce some notation. Let $\mathbf{c} = \{c_1,c_2\dots c_n\}$ . I'll denote $T(\mathbf{c})$ the $n\times n$ symmetric Toeplix matrix whose principal and upper diagonals are given by the coefficients $c_1\dots c_n$ . I mean something like $$T(\{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4\}) = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 & c_3 & c_4\\c_2 & c_1 & c_2 & c_3 \\ c_3 & c_2 & c_1 & c_2 \\ c_4 & c_3 & c_2 & c_1  \end{pmatrix}\,.$$ If we call $\mathbf{v}(x) = \{x-1,x,x+1\}$ , then $A(x) = T(\mathbf{v}(x))$ . Finally, given a $n$ -dimensional vector $\mathbf{c} = \{c_1\dots c_n\}$ , I'll call $\mathbf{c}^k$ the $(k\cdot n)$ -dimensional vector obtained joining together $k$ copies of $\mathbf{c}$ . For example $$\{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4\}^3 = \{c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4\}\,.$$ The main question I've stated at the beginning that $\det A(x) = 4x$ . With the above notation, $\det T(\mathbf{v}(x)) = 4x$ . Actually it seems to be true (at least for what I've tried with Mathematica) that for all positive integer $k$ $$\det T(\mathbf{v}^k(x)) = 4x\,.$$ I guess this result can be proven by induction on $k$ , but it seems to be a bit painful. I would expect some simple and clean proof for what seems to be such a neat result. Any ideas about what's going on and why the determinants are so simple? Going a bit further... Having noticed that things were so simple for $\mathbf{v}(x)=\{x-1,x,x+1\}$ , the first thing I've tried is to slightly change $\mathbf{v}$ . Let's now consider $T(\{x-2,x-1,x,x+1,x+2\}^k)$ . Unfortunatly in this case things get much more complicated. For $k=1$ the determinant is $16 x$ . But then for $k=2$ it's $113288 x$ , for $k=3$ $65157184 x$ and so on. Things are clearly much messier here. But... Let's define $\mathbf{w}(x) = \{x+2,x-1,x,x+1,x-2\}$ . Then the sequence of determinants seems to be very regular. \begin{align}
&\det T(\mathbf{w}(x)) = 16 x\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^2(x)) = -8 x\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^3(x)) = 0\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^4(x)) = -8 x\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^5(x)) = 16 x\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^6(x)) = -8 x\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^7(x)) = 0\\
&\det T(\mathbf{w}^8(x)) = -8 x
\end{align} and so on. So there is a clear pattern in the dependence on $k$ : $$\{16, -8, 0, -8, 16, -8, 0, -8, 16, -8, 0, -8, 16, -8, 0, -8, 16, -8, 0, -8,\dots\}\,.$$ Then we may look at $T(\{x-3,x+2,x-1,x,x+1,x-2,x+3\})$ and again there is a pattern: $$\{64, 12, 4, 0, 4, 12, 64, 12, 4, 0, 4, 12, 64, 12, 4, 0, 4, 12, 64, \dots\}\,.$$ And again for $T(\{x+4,x-3,x+2,x-1,x,x+1,x-2,x+3,x-4\})$ a new pattern: $$\{256, -16, 0, -16, 0, -16, 0, -16, 256, -16, 0, -16, 0, -16, 0, -16, 256, -16, 0, -16,\dots\}\,.$$ I would bet in the existence of a simple explanation for these patterns, but as for now I've really no clue. Any ideas?","['matrices', 'toeplitz-matrices', 'determinant', 'linear-algebra']"

3792067,Prime Spectrum of a ring: why is Geometry captured by local rings?,"If a function $f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is continuous, $f$ is locally invertible at all non-vanishing points. That is, for all points $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \neq 0$ , there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x_0$ and a function $g: U \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , such that for all $u \in U$ , $(f \times g)(u) = f(u) \times g(u) = 1$ . Is the converse true? Is a function which is locally invertible at all non-vanishing points continuous? It seems not. Consider the function $
f(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & x \in \mathbb Q \\
2 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$ This has an inverse function $
g(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & x \in \mathbb Q \\
1/2 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$ even though $f$ is discontinuous everywhere. So clearly, this locally invertible definition is very far away from giving us continuous functions. I am now unmotivated about the spectrum of a ring. It is this ""local inversion""
property that (I thought) motivates the definition of the structure sheaf
on the spectrum of a ring. In $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ , the ring of functions around a  point(prime) $\mathfrak p$ is $A_\mathfrak p$ . So all functions (ring elements) which are not zero
at $\mathfrak p$ will be forced to become invertible by way of localization. But this definition does not seem strong enough to actually capture what
we want --- it allows lots of pathological rings of functions, from which
we cannot recover the structure of the original space. The proof I know which recovers the original space given the ring of functions needs continuous

3792166,Union of all Borel subgroups is the whole group,"Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group. Then the union of all of its Borel subgroups is $G$ itself. I am following this proof on page 70 lemma 26.3. Let's just focus on the first part proving the union of all Borel subgroups is closed. But I found the proof is a kinda flawed. Let $B$ be a Borel subgroup. Consider $$G\times B\xrightarrow{\phi} G\times G\xrightarrow{\pi} G/B\times G\xrightarrow{\gamma} G$$ where $\phi:(g,b)\mapsto(g,gbg^{-1})$ , $\pi:(g,h)\mapsto(gB,h)$ , $\gamma:(gB,h)\mapsto h$ . In total, the image is the union of the conjugates of the Borel subgroup. We would like to show it is closed. Then we want to show $im(\pi\phi)$ is closed then by $G/B$ projectivity, we could conclude. But then I ran into trouble of being convinced by the proof. First, he wants to show $im(\phi)$ is closed. He cited a result proved before, corollary 16.5, which claims that the image of an algebraic group homomorphism is an algebraic group (closed). But this $\phi$ is not a group homomorphism, because $\phi((g,h)(x,y))=\phi(gx,hy)=(gx,gxhyx^{-1}g^{-1})$ but $\phi((g,h))\phi((x,y))=(g,ghg^{-1})(x,xyx^{-1})=(gx,ghg^{-1}xyx^{-1})$ . Apparently, they are not equal... Second, even if assume we have got $im(\phi)$ is closed, we want the image under $\pi$ is closed but $\pi$ is an open (surjective) map which was also proved. However, I do not think open surjective map implies closed map.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups']"

3792543,Spivak's Calculus: Chapter 3 Problem 24b,"24b) Suppose that $f$ is a function such that every number $b$ can be written $b = f(a)$ for some real number $a$ . Prove that there is a function $g$ such that $f \circ g = I$ I think I do understand this question and how to solve it, but I'm struggling to find a way to express my solution in a mathematically rigorous way, particularly when $f$ is not injective. Here's my idea: First of all, if $f$ is injective, then it's trivial. Let $g(x) = a$ , where $x = f(a)$ for any $a \in \text{domain}(f)$ Since $f$ is injective, by definition there is only one value of $a$ that satisfies $x = f(a)$ for each $x$ , which means $g$ is well defined. And $\text{domain}(g) = \text{image}(f)$ (by definition of $g$ ), which from the supposition in the question is $\mathbb{R}$ . Also, $\text{domain}(f) = \text{image}(g)$ , since $f$ and $g$ are injective (but that fact is not important). So $f(g(x))$ is defined for all $x âˆˆ \mathbb{R}$ . Finally, $f(g(x))$ = $f(a)$ , where $x = f(a)$ for $x âˆˆ \mathbb{R} \to f(g(x)) = I(x)$ . But now if $f$ is not injective, it gets more complicated. If I keep my original definition of $g$ , being "" $g(x) = a$ , where $x = f(a)$ for any $a \in \text{domain}(f)$ "", then that doesn't work because $g$ is no longer a function. Because since $f$ is not injective, there exists atleast 2 numbers $z$ and $w$ such that $z \neq w$ but $f(z) = f(w)$ , which means there exists $x$ such that: $g(x) = z = w$ . I think the idea is to simply redefine $g$ to simply ""choose"" either $z$ or $w$ , and assign it to $x$ . For example it could choose the smaller of the two. The only difference this would make is now $\text{domain}(f) \subset \text{image}(g)$ , instead of $\text{domain}(f) = \text{image}(g)$ . But since that fact wasn't important before, the conclusion in the question still holds. Here's my question. How do I explicitly write down a definition of $g$ that ""chooses"" the smaller of $z$ or $w$ ? Furthermore, recall there exists at least 2 numbers z and w. There could be arbitrarily more numbers such that $f(z) = f(w) = f(m) = f(n)$ and so on. And that's just one of the arbitrary branches the common values $f$ could take. There could be a different set of numbers $f(z_2)  = f(w_2) = f(m_2)$ and so on, that are not equal to $f(z)$ , etc. This is starting to get very messy. How can I express $g$ mathematically?","['notation', 'proof-writing', 'functions']"

We have the equation: $$x^2+x+1=0 $$ Since x=0 does not satisfy the equation, you can divide by x on both sides which yields: $$x+1+\frac{1}{x}=0$$ which is equivalent to our first equation. From our first eqution we can conclude that: $$-x^2=x+1$$ We now substitute that into the second equation to get: $$x^2=\frac{1}{x}$$ which results in $$x^3=1$$ which is equivalent to our previous equation since x cannot be 0. However, one solution from our last equation is x=1, which is not a solution to our original equation.

MY ATTEMPT Claim For $p \geq 3$ , $$\frac{7}{4} \leq I(2^{p-1}) < 2.$$ Proof: Only the left-hand inequality is not evident (as $2^{p-1}$ is deficient , being a proper divisor of the perfect number $2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ ). $$I(2^{p-1}) = \frac{\sigma(2^{p-1})}{2^{p-1}} = \frac{2^p - 1}{2^{p-1}} = 2 - \bigg(\frac{1}{2^{p-1}}\bigg).$$ But since $6 \neq 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)$ , then $p \geq 3$ , which implies that $$2^{p-1} \geq 4 \implies \frac{1}{2^{p-1}} \leq \frac{1}{4} \implies 2 - \bigg(\frac{1}{2^{p-1}}\bigg) \geq 2 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4}.$$ QED Checking now whether this inequality is satisfied: $$I(2^{p-1}) - 1 > \frac{1}{I(2^{p-1})}$$ For $p \geq 3$ : $$I(2^{p-1}) - 1 \geq \frac{3}{4} > \frac{4}{7} \geq \frac{1}{I(2^{p-1})}.$$ For general $p$ : $$I(2^{p-1}) - 1 = 1 - \bigg(\frac{1}{2^{p-1}}\bigg) = \frac{2^{p-1} - 1}{2^{p-1}}$$ $$\frac{1}{I(2^{p-1})} =  \frac{2^{p-1}}{2^p - 1}$$ $$\bigg(I(2^{p-1}) - 1\bigg) - \frac{1}{I(2^{p-1})} = \frac{2^{p-1} - 1}{2^{p-1}} - \frac{2^{p-1}}{2^p - 1} > 0 \text{ when } p \geq 3.$$ Note that, since $I(2^{p-1})=x$ satisfies the inequality $$I(2^{p-1}) - 1 > \frac{1}{I(2^{p-1})} \iff x - 1 > \frac{1}{x} \implies x^2 - x - 1 > 0 \text{ since } x > 1 > 0 \implies x > \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \varphi \approx 1.618,$$ which is trivial compared to the inequality $$I(2^{p-1})=x \geq \frac{7}{4} = 1.75.$$ Finally, notice that $6 = 2^{2 - 1} \cdot (2^2 - 1)$ was excluded in this analysis because it is squarefree.","['golden-ratio', 'perfect-numbers', 'number-theory', 'divisor-sum', 'inequality']"

Then I wonder: Then what is the sum of all real numbers $\mathbb R$ ? Contrarily to $\Bbb Z$ and $\Bbb Q$ , the set $\Bbb R$ is not countable. This means that it is impossible to list the numbers of $\Bbb R$ and thus impossible to sum all numbers using a sum. The first thing that came to my mind was integrals. I sometimes tend to think of integrals like the continuous version of summation. So we can express the sum of all real numbers as: $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \ dx = 0$$ This allows us to sum all elements of uncountable sets. For example the of all elements of $(0,1)$ , using this method would be: $$\int\limits_{x\in (0,1)} x \ dx = \int_0^1 x \  dx = \frac{1}{2}$$ My second question is: Is this generalization correct? My third question occurs when, assuming that this method is correct, I tried to calculate the sum of all irrational numbers. If the method is correct, then the sum of all irrational numbers would be: $$\int\limits_{x\in\mathbb I} x \ dx$$ But I don't know how to evaluate the integral because (I don't know the proper mathematical term for what I'm about to say so I'm sorry if it sounds not very rigorous) It has ""Holes"" in it. Between every 2 irrational numbers there's allays a rational number! If we try to integrate a function over $(0,1) \cup (2,3)$ there's also a hole in this, but we can divide the integral in two: one over $(0,1)$ and the other over $(2,3)$ . If we try to make use of this in our integral over $\mathbb I$ we would get: $$\sum_{q \in \Bbb I} \int\limits_{x\in\{q\}} x \ dx$$ But we have two problems with this: Firstly, that integral is a integral over a point, and that's allays zero. So that is not ideal because it would mean that the sum of any uncountable set will always be zero. We can't use a regular summation there because again, the set $\Bbb I$ is not countable. So we where trying to avoid the regular summation by generalizing it with integrals, but then it pops out again! So my third and last question is: Even if my generalization is not correct, is it sill possible to evaluate this integral?","['integration', 'elementary-set-theory']"
3792772,Multivariate Elliptic Integral,"I want to find a ""closed form"" solution to the following integral: $$I(a)=\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1\sqrt{\frac{a+ xy+yz+xz }{(1-x^2)(1-y^2)(1-z^2)}}\, \text{d}x\,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z$$ where $a>1$ to keep the integrand real valued.
I hope that the symmetry of the integrand might help.
I have tried integrating one variable after the other, but this involves Integrals of elliptic integrals that I am not familiar with: Another form of the integral is: $$I(a)=\int_{0}^\pi\int_0^\pi\int_0^\pi\sqrt{ a+ \cos(x)\cos(y)+\cos(y)\cos(z)+\cos(x)\cos(z) } \,\text{d}x\,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z$$ Evaluating the first integral, Mathematica gives: $I(a)=\int_0^\pi\int_0^\pi 2\sqrt{ a+\cos(y)+\cos(y)\cos(z)+ \cos(z) }E\left[\frac{2\cos(y)+2\cos(z) }{ a+\cos(y)+\cos(y)\cos(z)+ \cos(z) }\right]  \,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z$ Where $E$ is the Elliptic Integral of second kind. I dont know how to proceed.
Is there maybe a nice coordinate system I could transform into? Maybe I have to try a completely different approach?
Any insight would be helpful. Edit: I have made some progress by using the FCC Lattice Green's function.
It is defined by: $$G(a)=\frac{1}{\pi^3}\int_{0}^\pi\int_0^\pi\int_0^\pi\frac{1}{ 1 - \frac{a}{3}( \cos(x)\cos(y)+\cos(y)\cos(z)+\cos(x)\cos(z)) } \,\text{d}x\,\text{d}y\,\text{d}z$$ and has a known closed form solution in terms of Complete Elliptic Functions that can be found here (equation 2.20) I will add more info soon.","['integration', 'elliptic-integrals', 'multiple-integral', 'closed-form']"

Due to this comment of Jason DeVito , it is easy to see that action of $\Bbb S^1$ on $\Bbb S^3\subset \Bbb C^2$ defined by $z*(w_1,w_2)=(zw_1,w_2)$ fixes the entire circle $\{(0,w):|w|=1\}\subset\Bbb S^3\subset \Bbb C^2$ .
But I can't imagine it, because the common picture of action in my mind is that an circle action is a kind of rotation, so it has a rotation axis and spinning around this axis can fix at most 2 point. Is it possible that the axis of rotation is not a line? Now, how can I think about this action geometrically? $z*(w_1,w_2)=(zw_1,\bar zw_2)$ . Edit: My understanding of last action is that: one side of $\Bbb S^3$ is spinning clockwise and other side is spinning counterclockwise (in different plane from first action) and these actions effect on the middle of sphere and it become scarious and kink in middle, Like cylinder if we spin the boundaries of it in different directions it become kink in middle like screw.","['differential-topology', 'group-actions', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3792920,Expected Matrix Product,"This question has arisen from a question about a Markov chain where the transition matrix $T$ is random but structured. The idea being that the transition is composed of two parts, transition $A$ and $B$ which occur in known quantities $n$ and $m$ respectively but unknown order. This means that $T$ is the product of $n$ matrices $A$ and $m$ matrices $B$ in some ordering. For example when $m=1$ and $n=2$ $$T \in \{ABB, BAB, BBA\}$$ The question is, when each permutation $\begin{pmatrix} m+n \\ m\end{pmatrix}$ of these $n+m$ matrices is equally likely what is the expected transition matrix $T$ ? Interestingly this is like considering necklaces with fixed content where the colors are matrices. I say this because in the sense that I'm interested in the behavior of $T$ as it is applied to itself, if this problem could be solved invariant to rotations of the ordering of $A,B$ that would also be helpful. My thinking: My initial hope was that $$E[T] = \left(\frac{n}{n+m}A +\frac{m}{n+m} B\right)^{n+m}$$ But that does not seem to be the case by numerical experiments for small $n,m$ where the expected value can be calculated directed by summing over every permutation. My second hope was to be able to ""factor out"" the matrices $A,B$ in the expected value expression. By letting $D = diag(rep(A,n),rep(B,m))$ the (n+m)*size(A) block-diagonal matrix we can consider constructing one order from some permutation $\Pi_1$ . \begin{align*}
T(\Pi_1) &= \prod_i^{n+m} (e_i^T \otimes I) (\Pi_1\otimes I) D (\Pi_1\otimes I)^T (e_i \otimes I)\\
&= \prod_i^{n+m} (e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I)D (\Pi_1^T e_i \otimes I)
\end{align*} each term of this product permutes the diagonal blocks of $D$ is the same way, then $(e_i^T \otimes I) \cdots (e_i \otimes I) $ selects off the $i$ th block. This way each of the $n+m$ blocks of $A,B$ occur in some order determined by $\Pi_1$ . My hope from this formulation was that in this form each $\Pi$ would factor out in the expected value of $T$ : $$E[T] = \frac{1}{(\begin{pmatrix} m+n \\ m\end{pmatrix}} \sum_{\Pi} T(\Pi)$$ by using vectorizations but it doesn't seem to work. Notably for each term in the product of $T(\Pi)$ we have $$vec\left((e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I)D (\Pi_1^T e_i \otimes I)\right) = (\Pi_1 e_i^T \otimes I)\otimes(e_i^T \Pi_1\otimes I) vec(D) $$ The problem here is that despite the data matrix $D$ factoring out nicely from one term it does not help us simplify the product as far as I can tell.

This question is from Herstein and it comes before Sylowâ€™s and Cauchyâ€™s theorem. So Iâ€™m expecting an answer without using any of these. Hereâ€™s what I got so far: If $G$ is cyclic, then we are done, otherwise we can assume that it is not cyclic, which means every non-identity element must be of order $p$ or $q$ . Case (1): if there exists $a \in G$ such that $o(a) = p$ and if there also exists an element of order $q$ , then we are done. So we can assume that every non-identity element is of order $p$ . Now pick $b \in G$ such that $b \notin \langle a \rangle$ then $o(b) = p$ and $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \langle e \rangle$ . So we have $\langle a \rangle \langle b \rangle \subset G$ but $o(\langle a \rangle \langle b \rangle) = \dfrac {o(\langle a \rangle) o(\langle b \rangle)}{o(\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle)} = p^2$ but $p^2 > pq$ [since $p>q$ ] so we got a contradiction.

It obviously suffices to show its derivative is always positive in this range (which is also clear from plotting it).  We have $$f'(x) = \frac{(1+x^2)\arctan^2(x) -x^2}{x^2(1+x^2)\arctan^2(x)}$$ so again it suffices to show that $$g(x) \equiv (1+x^2)\arctan^2(x) -x^2 \ge 0 \quad \forall x >0$$ (and, yet again, this is clear from plotting it).  I've jumped down the rabbit hole of taking the derivative of $g$ as well (since it is $0$ at $x = 0$ so it would again suffice to show that $g' \ge 0$ ) and it doesn't yield anything immediately useful for me.

3793249,Bounds related to satisfiability problem,"This question is regarding MAX-E3SAT problem: Given a set of clauses with exactly three literals, find the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. The clauses are expressed as disjunctions of three literals. The literals are variables $x_i\in\{0,1\}$ . Assume that the literals are all distinct in a clause, and no clause has both $x_i$ and $\neg x_i$ as the clause will be trivially satisfied. Furthermore, all clauses are considered to be distinct. Let's say at most a fraction $\alpha$ of the $m$ clauses are satisfiable. Let $k=\sum_i^n (g_i-1)$ , where $n$ is the number of variables and $g_i=\text{max}(\{\text{occurrences of }x_i, \text{occurrences of }\neg x_i\})$ . I want to find lower and upper bounds on the ratio $\frac{m}{k}$ given $\alpha$ . The bounds can be in terms of $\alpha$ . In my attempt I realized that for an instance of E3SAT, with $l$ variables, to be not satisfiable we need $2^l$ clauses at the minimum. So reversing this, if we have $m$ clauses, then the instance is unsatisfiable if it has $< \log_2(m)$ variables. However, I can't seem to find a way to get a constant bound, and carry forward the intuition to any fraction $\alpha$ of the clauses not being satisfiable. Edit:
I figured a rather conservative and simple bound for $k$ . Number of occurrences of all the variables in the instance is $3m$ . Then $k< 3m$ . However, this seems to be a very conservative bound.","['satisfiability', 'logic', 'combinatorics', 'upper-lower-bounds']"

I want to prove that for every $x > 0$ , we have $$P(S_n \ge x) \leq \left(\frac{\mu e}{x}\right)^x $$ I can do this for $x \in (0,1]$ by noting that the function $f(y) \equiv y^x, y \ge 0$ is concave for $x$ in this range, hence we have $$P(S_n \ge x) \leq P(eS_n \ge x) \leq P(e^x S_n^x \ge x^x) \leq \frac{e^x E(S_n^x)}{x^x}\leq \frac{e^x E(S_n)^x}{x^x} = \left(\frac{\mu e}{x} \right)^x $$ where we apply Jensen's inequality to get the last inequality.

I want to arrive at $$\bigg|\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_{i})(t_{i}-t_{i-1}) - \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx \bigg| < \epsilon \\ \Rightarrow\ -\epsilon < \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_{i})(t_{i}-t_{i-1}) - \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx  < \epsilon$$ Fiddling around with equation 2, I would get something of the form $$ 0 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_{i})(t_{i}-t_{i-1}) - L(f,P) \leq U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \epsilon$$ The same would occur for $\int_{a}^{b}f(x) dx$ .

My friend Tommy proposed once a condition for an infinitely differentiable solution. $t,x$ are real and $t > 0$ : $$ \frac{d^n}{d^n x} \exp^{[t]}(x) > 0 $$ It seems impossible to satisfy for analytic solutions because for $ 0 < t < 1$ we have singularities in the complex plane that force the radius being finite and the signs of the derivatives of the taylor series alternating ( because the singularities have taylor series with alternating signs and near the singularities we must have it too). For instance if you are close to a log singularity your taylor series must eventually copy the sign changes of the logarithm. However if the bundle of functions $exp^{[t]}$ are nowhere analytic on the real line but infinitely differentiable, this might be true ??

3793423,"Does there exist a pair of infinite fields, the additive group of one isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the other?","It is a common exercise in algebra to show that there does not exist a field $F$ such that its additive group $F^+$ and multiplicative group $F^*$ are isomorphic. See e.g. this question . One of the snappiest proofs I know is that, if we suppose for a contradiction they are, then any isomorphism sends solutions of the equation $2x = 0$ in the additive group to solutions of the equation $y^2 = 1$ in the multiplicative group. Depending on whether the characteristic of $F$ is or isn't 2, the former has either $|F|$ or $1$ solution(s), while the latter has $1$ or $2$ solutions, respectively. There is no field for which these numbers agree, so $F^+ \not\cong F^*$ ever. One might now ask whether there is a pair of fields, $E$ and $F$, for which $E^+ \cong F^*$ as groups. Clearly $\def\GF#1{\mathrm{GF}(#1)}\GF2^+ \cong \GF3^*$, $\GF3^+ \cong \GF4^*$, and in general if $p$ is a prime and $p+1$ is a prime power, then $\GF p^+ \cong \GF{p+1}^*$. You can see that this characterizes the situation in the positive characteristic case, from the same equation trick above: if $\def\c{\operatorname{char}}\c E = 2$ and $\c F \ne 2$, we can make $|E| = 2$ and get a solution. Else we must have $\c E \ne 2 = \c F$. If $\c E = c \ne 0$, then elements of $E$ must get mapped to $c$-th roots of unity in $F$, and there can be at most $c$ of those. This leaves the case where $\c E = 0$, for which there are no finite fields. In fact, none of the cases above permit any infinite fields, either. This brings me to my question: Do there exist infinite fields $E$ and $F$ such that $E^+ \cong F^*$? I believe the answer is no, and it seems unlikely that such an isomorphism would exist, but I can't make heads or tails of it, really. Here's what I have. As above, I can show that if $E$ and $F$ are infinite, and $\phi: E^+ \to F^*$ is an isomorphism, then we may assume $\c E = 0$â€”so WLOG it is an extension of $\mathbb Q$â€”and $\c F = 2$. Every element of $E$ has infinite additive order, so every element of $F^*$ has infinite multiplicative order, and there are no roots of unity except $1 = \phi(0)$. However, if $a \ne 1$ in $F$, then $a$ has a $k$-th root $\phi(\frac1k \phi^{-1}(a))$ for all $k$, since $E \supseteq \mathbb Q$.","['field-theory', 'group-isomorphism', 'positive-characteristic']"

After reading the parts on the differential and its computation in coordinates, I'm still wondering why we would be interested in defining a tangent vector as a map that acts on functions on the manifold and the benefits from acting on smooth functions. The main reason that I can think of is that the collection of derivations at a point forms a vector space, which is we what want for a tangent space. I have also looked at the approach of defining tangent vectors with equivalence classes of curves, but it seems that there's also an action on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ going on; we call curves $\gamma:J\to M$ the tangent vectors, and they have a directional-derivative-like operators that act on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ by \begin{align*}
\left.\frac{d}{dt}(f\circ \gamma)(t)\right|_{t=0}.

Note that for any integral solution $(a,b)$ we have $a>0, b>0$ since k is not a perfect square. Let $(a,b)$ be an integral solution with $a>0, b>0$ and $a+b$ minimum.

The only assumption contradicted is the minimality of $a+b$ , not the assumption $k$ is not a perfect square. How does the assertion trivially follow from this proof? EDIT:
Here is the proof modified, but without the assumption $k$ is not a perfect square. $k=\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1} \implies a^2-kab+b^2=k, k\in \mathbb{Z}$ Let $(a,b)$ be an integral solution with $a>0, b>0$ and $a+b$ minimum.

A compact convex set in $\mathbb{R}$ is a closed interval, so I need to prove this for $\mathbb{\Omega}=[a,b]$ . Now, let's consider $g(x)=f(x)-x$ , which is also continuous. We assume $g(a)\cdot g(b)\neq0$ , otherwise we already found a fixed point. Of course, we must have $g(a)>0$ , otherwise we would have $f(a)<a$ which contradicts the hypothesis that $f$ maps $[a,b]$ into itself. Similarly, we must have $g(b)<0$ . Since $g(a)\cdot g(b)<0$ , then by Bolzano's theorem there is at least one $x_0\in[a,b]$ such that $g(x_0)=0\implies f(x_0)=x_0\ \square$","['fixed-point-theorems', 'real-analysis']"

3793814,Verification of a solution to a mathematical logic problem,"The question is as follows: A detective has interviewed four witnesses to a crime. The detective has concluded the following based on how those interviews went : If the butler is telling the truth, the cook is doing so too. The cook and the gardener can't both be telling the truth. The gardener and the handyman aren't both lying. If the handyman is telling the truth, the cook must be lying. The question is, can the detective figure out whether each of the individuals is lying or not? Explain the reasoning. Answer: We're here only considering whether someone is truthful or not. So we can just take a variable, that's either True or False in any of the possible cases, and walk ourselves back from there. cook is one such variable [True means that specific person is telling the truth, and False means the exact opposite]. If we consider cook to be True, handyman must be False (Statement #4). According to statement #3, gardener and handyman can't both be False  at the same time, as we already know handyman is False (i.e. lying), gardener has to be True. If gardener is True, according to statement #2, cook has to be False. This contradicts our first assumption, that is cook is True, i.e. telling the truth. Which leaves us to cook being False. We can't straight out just say that cook is False and the case is solved. That's because if cook is False, then handyman is True. But this branches statement #3 into two different routes. gardener and handyman aren't both False, which means either either one of them is True, or both are. As handyman is True, let's first consider gardener is False. Now we're again in the same situation where  either either of them is False or both are. If cook is True, we'll be contradicting our initial assumption, so cook can't be True. Which leaves us to cook being False`. This gives us the first set of logically correct assumptions. Let's note it down. cook = False
handyman = True
gardener = False
butler = False Now we'll be considering gardener to be True. If gardener is True, cook has to be False. So now we have another solution set cook = False
handyman = True
gardener = True
butler = False Comparing the two logically correct solutions we can easily come to the assumption that the detective can't determine whether the each individual is lying or not, as there are more than one possible cases. Is the method too tedious? Is there any other method of achieving the same?

They differ in the closure axioms of unions and intersections. The uncanny resemblance between a metric and a measure makes me wonder as to why these axioms have been defined separately. Couldn't they develop a theory with just the concept of a measure and a measure space? The one issue I see is that it might create circular logic. If we need topological space axioms to develop concepts in measure theory, that is a reason why we'd need to separate the two concepts.
