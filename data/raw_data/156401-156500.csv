2658072,Is there a simple characterization of the sets that admit a uniform probability distribution?,"The following subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ (not an exhaustive list) admit a uniform probability distribution: Finite sets Intervals (open or closed) with both endpoints finite Finite unions of the above Is there a simpler way to characterize the set of subsets $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ that admit a uniform probability distribution? One naive guess is that $S$ is bounded, but this requirement is neither necessary nor sufficient: e.g. the set $$\left \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \right \}$$
is bounded but does not admit a uniform probability distribution, while the set
$$\bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty \left[ n - 2^{-n}, n + 2^{-n} \right]$$
is not bounded but does admit a uniform distribution. My guess is that the answer is no, because by combining together sets of types 1 and 2 in the list above, we are combining ""apples and oranges"", as discrete and continuous probability distributions are qualitatively different. If we want to extend the support of a discrete random variable taking on a finite number of possible values to the real line, then we shouldn't think of its probability distribution as a probability mass function, but instead as a finite sum of Dirac delta functions, which are a very different beast from continuous probability density functions. Is this correct?","['uniform-distribution', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions']"

2658176,Structure theorem for modules implies Smith Normal Form,"I am working on a homework problem for an undergrad abstract algebra course and I have been stuck on something for a while. I am not looking for a full proof, but any help would be much appreciated. Apologies if this is something simple! The problem: Show that for any matrix $B \in M_{n,m}(R)$, the orbit $GL_n(R) \cdot B \cdot GL_m(R)$ contains a matrix $A$ in Smith normal form, and moreover the integer $k$ and the ideals $(A_{11}),\ldots,(A_{kk})$ are uniquely determined. Edit: $R$ is a PID, and $k$ is the highest integer $i$ such that $A_{ii} \neq 0$. I have the structure theorem at my disposal, and I have shown that $GL_n(R) \cdot B \cdot GL_m(R)$ corresponds to the set of matrices for the linear transformation $f: R^m \to R^n$ given by $f(m) = Bm$ for all possible bases of $R^m$ and $R^n$. It is suggested that I start with the $\ker(B) = \{0\}$ case and modify from there; I have figured out how to prove the full theorem assuming this case. Does anyone have any suggestions for going about this case? Again, I am not necessarily looking for a full proof, just something to help me get unstuck.

2658368,How is Category Theory used to study differential equations?,"I know that one can use Category Theory to formulate polynomial equations by modeling solutions as limits. For example, the sphere is the equalizer of the functions

  s,t:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R},\qquad s(x,y,z):=x^2+y^2+z^2,~t(x,y,z)=1.
  \label{equalizer}
\end{equation}
One could then find out more about the solution set by mapping the equalizer diagram into other categories. More generally, solution sets of polynomial equations (and more generally, algebraic varieties ) are a central study object of algebraic geometry. As differential equations are central to all areas of physics, I assume that there have been made a lot of attempts to generalise these ideas to solution sets of these. However, I do not yet have a lot of knowledge about algebraic geometry, topos theory or synthetic differential geometry. Thus I would be grateful if someone could explain roughly where and how Category Theory is used to study differential equations. Can Category Theory really help to solve differential equations (for example by mapping diagrams of equations to other categories, similarly to how problems of topology are often solved by mapping topological spaces to algebraic ones in algebraic topology) or can it ""only"" provide schemes for generalising differential equations to other spaces/categories? I am particularly interested in names of areas I have to look into if I want to understand this better. Also literature recommendation would be very welcome. EDIT : I found a book by Vinogradov called Cohomological Analysis of Partial Differential Equations and Secondary Calculus where ""the main result [...] is Secondary Calculus on diffieties"". However, the material is very deep and thus I am still not completely able to say whether these ""new geometrical objects which are analogs of algebraic varieties"" can be used to help solving PDEs or if they serve to structure the theory of PDEs or result in other applications I am not aware of.

2658455,Simultaneous rotations,"I've been puzzled by this question for a while now (something I stumbled upon myself): Say I have two 2-spheres $S^2$. For the $k$-th sphere ($k \in \{ 0,1 \}$), I define two axes:
$$
a_k = \hat{z} \\
b_k = \sin\left(\frac{\pi(k+1/2)}{2}\right) \hat{y} +  \cos\left(\frac{\pi(k+1/2)}{2}\right)\hat{z}
$$
Denote an $SO(3)$ rotation around $a_k$ by angle $x$ (with some convention about handedness) by $R_{a_k}(x)$, and similarly for $b_k$. For each sphere, I rotate a point $v_i^{(k)} = (0,0,1)$ to a new point $v_f$ according to
$$
v_f^{(k)}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = R_{a_k}(x_4) R_{b_k}(x_3) R_{a_k}(x_2) R_{b_k}(x_1) v_i^{(k)}
$$
where the angles $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) \in [0,2\pi)^4$ are the same for both sphere (hence the title simultaneous rotations, just that the rotations are around  different fixed axes for each sphere) Now, after playing around with this a bit, I feel like under this map, there always exists a (non-unique) set of angles such that I can get to any point on $(S^2)^2$..  that is, the map $( v_j^{(1)}, v_j^{(2)})(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ is surjective.

In the subsequent discussion, the author seems to use only the linear notions, such as in this one: However, this is just my guess. I'm not sure if it is the case. Is it correct to assume that the matrix V in Definition 6.5. has only 1's in its first row? If not, please explain why the condition ""1z = 0"" is no longer necessary.

Let $f:V \rightarrow W$ be a linear map. a) Define the dual of $f$ as the map $f^\ast : W^\ast \rightarrow V^\ast$, $e \mapsto e \circ f$. b) Suppose we define two fixed non-degenerate bilinear forms $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle_V : V^2 \rightarrow K$, $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle_W : W^2 \rightarrow K$. Define the adjoint of $f$ as the map $\bar{f}: W \rightarrow V$ satisfying
$\langle v,\bar{f}(w) \rangle_V = \langle f(v),w \rangle_W$. Since the bilinear forms are non-degenerate, the linear maps $\phi_V : V \rightarrow V^\ast$ and $\phi_W : W \rightarrow W^\ast$ given by
$$ \phi_V(v)(v_0) = \langle v,v_0 \rangle_V, \qquad \phi_W(w)(w_0) = \langle w,w_0 \rangle_W $$

2658533,Consequence of convergence of indicator function to zero in probability.,"Let $ (\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P) $ be a probability space. Suppose that $ \{ X_n := 1_{A_n} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ is a sequence of simple random variables and $ X \equiv 0$. It is claimed that $ X_{n} \rightarrow_{P} X $ in probability is equivalent to the statement $ P(A_n) \rightarrow 0. $ Sadly I can't seem to grasp how this is so. I have the following argument: By definition $ X_n \rightarrow_{P} X $ implies for every $ \epsilon > 0 $, $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P[ \omega \in \Omega: |X_{n}-X|\geq \epsilon ] = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}P[w \in \Omega: 1_{A_n}\geq \epsilon]=0.$$ 
Then for every $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ and every $ \omega \in [1_{A_n}\geq \epsilon] $ we have that $\omega$ satisfies 
$$1_{A_n}(\omega) \geq \epsilon $$
for every $\epsilon \geq 0$. In particular, if we take $ \epsilon > 1 $ then for no $\omega $ can the above inequality be correct, thus $[1_{A_n}\geq \epsilon ] \neq A_n $ since this would require that $1_{A_{n}}=1$.

The number of ways 2 identical objects can be placed in 4 distinct regions is 10 (stars and bars). Out of those, there are 4 cases which satisfy the condition. Hence the probability is $2/5$. Solution 2 (my friend's) : The order of the points being placed does matter. That means there are 16 ways to place the points (4 orientations × 4 regions). Out of those, 4 cases satisfy the condition. Hence the probability is $1/4$. Now of course, one line of reasoning must be wrong here. Which one is wrong?

2658609,"How to show the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $\langle x,y\rangle\leq \|y\|\|x\|_*$ for computing the Fenchel conjugate of a norm","I want to show that the Fenchel conjugate of a norm is the indicator function on the unit ball of the dual norm. The Fenchel conjugate is defined for a function $f$ as, $$f^*(y) = \sup\limits_{x} \langle y, x\rangle -f(x),$$ the dual norm $\|\cdot\|_*$ of a norm $\|\cdot\|$ is defined as, $$\|z\|_* = \sup\limits_{\|u\|\leq 1}\langle z, u\rangle,$$ and the indicator function of a set $C$, denoted $i_C$, is defined as, $$i_C(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x\in C,\\ +\infty & x\not\in C\end{cases}.$$ Then the problem is to show that $\|x\|^* = i_{\|x\|_*\leq 1}(x)=\begin{cases} 0 & \|x\|_*\leq 1\\ +\infty & \|x\|_*>1\end{cases}.$ First we consider $x$ with $\|x\|_*>1$. Then, by definition of the dual norm, we have,
$$\sup\limits_{\|y\|\leq 1}\langle y,x\rangle>1.$$ So, $\exists y:\|y\|\leq 1$ such that $\langle y,x\rangle >1$, i.e. $\langle y,x\rangle - \|y\| > 0$. If we choose $z=ty$ then we have, $$\langle z, x\rangle - \|z\| = t(\langle y,x\rangle -\|y\|)$$ and now letting $t\to\infty$ shows that $\langle z, x\rangle - \|z\|$ is unbounded, i.e. $\|x\|^* = \infty$ for $\|x\|_*>1$. Now, I am stuck on the remaining case. For this, we consider $x$ with $\|x\|_*\leq 1$.

Without loss of generality, assume all $f_i>0$. Put the $\frac{1}{2}$ on LHS out of the norm, and cancel it with the $\frac{1}{2}$ on RHS. Put the $2$ on RHS into the p-norm.

||\sum^k_{i=1}f_i ||_{\frac{p}{2}} \leq \sum^k_i \left|\left| f_i^2 \right|\right|_{\frac{p}{2}},

Can anyone help me? Thank you for the comments! Though the book has rare typos, the original inequality may have square $2$ outside the LHS p-norm? That is, \begin{equation}

||\sum^k_{i=1}f_i ||_{\frac{p}{2}}^2 \leq \sum^k_i \left|\left| f_i^2 \right|\right|_{\frac{p}{2}},
\end{equation} The reason is that, similar to Cauchy, Minkowski, Holder inequalities, both sides now have the same ""order""/""power"". No matther which case is true, this kind of inequality is elegant. Hope we can achieve the right one. @Calvin Khor I think your comment is correct.

A (linear Ehresmann) connection on a vector bundle $\pi: E \to M$ is a smooth distribution $\mathcal{H}$ on the total space $E$ such that $\mathcal{H}$ is complementary to the vertical bundle: $TE = \mathcal{H} \oplus \mathcal{V} \ E$ $\mathcal{H}$ is homogenous: $T_y \mu_r (\mathcal{H}_y) = \mathcal{H}_{ry}$, where $\mu_r: E \to E $ is the multiplication map. He also gives it as an exercise to prove that there is a bijection between such connections and covariant derivatives (which he calls Koszul connections). However M. Postnikov in his book ""Semester IV. Differential Geometry"" gives a definition using local-coordinate representation of $\mathcal{H}$, such that the last condition above is replaced by: the condition that in the trivialization $E|_U \cong U \times V$, with $V$ - vector space, and $x_1,...,x_n$ - coordinates on the base,  $a_1,...,a_m$ - coordinates on the fiber, the forms $\theta_i$ defining $\mathcal{H}=Ann(\{\theta_i\})$, have the form $$\theta_i=da^i + \Gamma_{kj}^{i}(x) a^j dx^k \ \ (*)$$or in other words that if $$\theta_i=da^i + e_k^i(x,a)dx^k \ \ (**)$$ then functions $e_k^i(x,a)$ must be linear in the coordinates on the fiber. Now, it is easy to see that Postnikov's definition satisfies all the conditions of Lee's definition. However if one tries to write coordinate representation of Lee's definition, one can get to the form $(**)$ with functions $e_k^i(x,a)$ being only homogenous in the coordinates on the fiber. M. Postnikov then uses his second condition in the explicit construction showing the equivalence of his notion of connection to the usual covariant derivate 
 - basically, $\Gamma_{kj}^{i}(x) dx^k$ give connection forms $\omega_j^i$ on the base. He also later emphasizes, that, contrary to the case of principle bundles, one cannot make an easy coordinate free definition in the case of vector bundles. From that I suspect that it might be actually impossible to retrieve a covariant derivative out of Lee's definition - there seems to be no way of separating coordinates on the base from coordinates on the fiber in $e_k^i(x,a)dx^k$ to get connection forms on the base. So can you please clarify what is the right take on the notion of Ehresmann connection? Is there a clean coordinate-free way of defining it similar to Lee's approach, contrary to what M. Postnikov is suggesting? Remark. I am familiar with an approach of passing to the frame bundle and defining there a connection using an equivariant fundamental form. I am curious if it is possible to work only on the vector bundle itself.","['connections', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
2658824,"""Beats"" via trig identity or something?","Planning on talking about resonance in DE. The solution to the IVP $$y''+y=\cos(t),\quad y(0)=y'(0)=0$$is $$y=\frac12 t\sin(t).$$Resonance, great. Now what if the forcing function has almost the resonant frequency? If $\alpha^2\ne1$ the solution to $$y''+y=\cos(\alpha t),\quad y(0)=y'(0)=0$$is $$y=\frac1{1-\alpha^2}(\cos(\alpha t)-\cos(t)).$$It's pleasant to note that this is $\sim\frac12 t\sin(t)$ as $t\to0$, and that for every $t$ it tends to $\frac12 t\sin(t)$ as $\alpha\to1$. For a fixed $\alpha$ close to $1$ it's clear if you think about it that $\cos(\alpha t)-\cos(t)$ exhibits ""beats"": there are intervals where it's close to $2\cos(\alpha t)$ and intervals where it's close to $0$. Alas when I say ""you"" here it's also clear that I mean you , not my DE students. Hence the question: Is there a clever way to  write $\cos(\alpha t)-\cos(t)$ so that the beats are evident? Like it's clear that $\cos(\epsilon t)\cos(t)$ shows beats - something analogous to that? Of course $$e^{i\alpha t}-e^{it}=e^{it}(e^{i(\alpha-1)t}-1),$$but I'd rather avoid complex numbers here and sadly the real part of a product is not the product of the real parts. I could use that, or just the sum formula for the cosine, to get a sum of two products, each of which is the sort of thing I want. But writing it as just the product of something with frequency $1$ and something with low frequency would be so much nicer. This must be well studied by people who study such things...","['almost-periodic-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2658877,Is there an extension of the reverse triangle inequality to $n$ variables?,"The triangle inequality for real numbers states $|x+y| \leq |x| + |y|$ . This is extended easily on induction to the corresponding result for $n$ variables $$|x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n| \leq |x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|, \quad \text{i.e. } \quad \left| \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right| \leq \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|.$$ The two variable triangle inequality (and indeed the $n$ variable version) is 'as tight as possible' since equality can be achieved; this happens when either of the variables is zero or when both have the same sign. The reverse triangle inequality goes in the opposite direction; it states $|x-y| \geq ||x| - |y||$ . This inequality is also as tight as possible; again we have equality when either of the variables is zero or they both have the same sign. To make the reverse triangle inequality look more like the normal triangle inequality, we can put $y \mapsto -y$ to give $|x+y| \geq ||x| - |y||$ . This inequality remains as tight as possible, except now we have equality when either of the variables is zero or they have opposite signs. Hence in the two variable case we can say $$||x| - |y|| \leq |x+y| \leq |x| + |y|.$$ It isn't obvious to me whether the reverse triangle inequality can be extended to 3 variables; trying to extend it in the same way one extends the normal traingle inequality doesn't seem to work, and I couldn't find anything about it online. My intuition tells we that there probably isn't an extension because subtraction is not commutative. If it is the case that there is no such generalisation of the reverse triangle inequality, does there exist a different formula for a lower bound on $|x+y+z|$ , or is the best we can do $0 \leq |x+y+z|$ ?","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality', 'absolute-value']"

since $a(s)<0$ for all $s$ and $u(s)>0$ for all $s\in(0,t)$ we know that

2659246,"Can we assume that every possible ""process"" has an underlying probability distribution?","To make the question clearer, I will write the context in which I formulated it myself. I was studying the twelve coin puzzle , in which you are given 12 coins and by using a balance certain number of times you need to decide something about the coins.
The details actually don't matter.
The problem I wanted to solve was not the puzzle itself but giving a bound on the maximum number of coins $n$ you can have if you want to solve the puzzle using the balance $k$ times. This is a classical problem, which can be approached using techniques from combinatorics, for example.
For my approach, however, I used Information Theory to get the bound.
My argument started like this: Let $X$ be the random variable representing the possible states of the coins. What we want is to be able to determine $X$ out from $k$ uses of a balance, for any distribution of $X$ .... What remains of the proof, just like the details of this problem itself, are not relevant.
What matters is the question I made to myself at this point: Is it OK to assume some kind of distribution from the states of the coins? This looks weird, because even though the proof gives the same bound you can get with combinatorial methods, these do not assume anything about the underlying distribution of the coins. On the other hand, I'm assuming that the coins must have some kind of distribution! Even if we don't know it, it must be there. I am aware of other contexts where you assume data distributions must exist.
In Machine Learning for example, you make predictions based on the assumption that the underlying data has some distribution, which although unknown, is there! (So statistical arguments can be applied). The question I will do my best to abstract my question in a concise way out from my examples above. Is it natural to regard any outcome from a process as a random variable with an underlying distribution? Are there some studies in this direction?

2659475,Bijective Proof Involving the Motzkin Numbers,"In answering a question involving tree counting, I ran across the Motzkin numbers, which I had never encountered before.  The problem involved counting the number of rooted, ordered trees with $n$ nodes, subject to the condition that no nodes has degree greater than 3.  Basically, I solved the problem by finding a recurrence, computing some terms, and sticking the result in OEIS.  This turned up the Motzkin numbers, except that I had $T_n=M_{n-1}.$  (Now that I think of it, the correspondence would have been perfect if I'd changed to counting trees with $n$ edges.)  Except for the difference in index, the two sequences had the same initial values, and satisfied the same recurrence, so they are identical. Anyway, I see on Wikipedia that one way to define $M_n$ is the Motzkin number for $n$ gives the number of routes on the upper right quadrant of a grid from coordinate $(0, 0)$ to coordinate $(n, 0)$ in $n$ steps if one is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at each step but forbidden from dipping below the $y = 0$ axis. I have been trying to find a bijective proof that the number of such paths equals the number of admissible trees with $n$ edges, but I'm not having any luck.  I can see that going up corresponds to a node with two children, going straight to an node with one child, and going down to a node with no child, but I can't figure out how to make the correspondence in detail. I've drawn the $9$ trees with $4$ edges, and I've been comparing them to the paths pictured on Wikipedia, and I can match up some of them, but not all.  For example, there are only two trees that have two nodes of degree $3$, and there are only two paths shown that go up twice, so the pairs must correspond.  However, the two trees are symmetric, in that they correspond if left and right are interchanged, and I see no such symmetry in the path. I've also thought about traversing the tree by depth-first search say, and somehow encoding the edges as Up, Straight, or Down, but I haven't been able to make that work out.

$$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{x-r_k}$$

$$\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{x}=-\frac{1}{x^2}$$

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \right)=\frac{f''(x)f(x)-(f'(x))^2}{f(x)^2}=-\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{(x-r_k)^2}$$

2660281,Show $\lim_{n\to \infty}{|A_{n}|+|A_{n-2}| \above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}=2$,"Question: Let $A(n)$ be a finite square $n \times n$ matrix with entries
  $a_{ij}=1$ if $i+j$ is a  prime; otherwise equals to $0$. I write $|A(n)|$ to count the number of $1$'s in $A(n)$. Is it true, possibly trivially, and how can we show that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}{|A_{n}|+|A_{n-2}| \above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}=2$$ The sequence of $A(n)$'s can be found here in Sloan. The graph below illustrates the limit. I believe I have shown the question is true, conditionally using a parity argument along with Bertrand's Postulate. Solution: It is easy to verify that $A(n)$ has exactly $2n-1$ skew
  diagonal . Two small lemmas. $\underline{\text{lemma 1}}:$  Observe $a_{ii}=1$ if and only if
  $i=1$. Consequently $a_{11}$ is the only entry on the main diagonal of
  $A(n)$ equal to $1$. Note $A(n)$ is symmetric since addition is commutative. So the count of $1$'s below the main diagonal equals the counts of $1$'s above the main diagonal and the two counts combined form an even number. If we remember to add the sole $1$ for the entry $a_{11}$ then there are an odd number of entries in $A(n)$. In particular $|A(n)|$ is always odd. $\underline{\text{lemma 2}}:$ As mentioned earlier every matrix $A(n)$
  has $2n-1$ skew diagonals. Let $S_n$ be the $n$-th skew diagonal of $A(n)$. A skew analogue of Bertrand's
  Postulate shows
  that at least one of the skews between $S_n$ and $S_{2n-2}$ has all of its entries equal to $1$. Consequently for $n>2$ we have that there is always a  skew diagonal with entries equal to $1$ below the main skew diagonal. In particular $\{A(n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a monotonically increasing sequence of odd integers. Lemma's 1 and 2 control the growth of $A(n)$ as $n \to \infty.$ By
  parity check alone as $A(n)$ grows to $A(n+1)$ the count of new $1$'s
  must be an nonzero even number. Because of this we have that
  $|A_n|=|A_{n-1}|+2j$ for some $j\in\mathbb{N}$, $j\neq0$. So we have the
  following from direct substitution \begin{align} {|A_{n}|+|A_{n-2}| \above 1.5pt|A_{n-1}|}&={\left(|A_{n-1}|+2j\right)+\left(|A_{n-1}|-2k\right)\above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}\\
 &=2\cdot{|A_{n-1}|+j-k\above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}\\
 &=2\cdot\left(1+{j-k\above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}\right)\\
\end{align} Taking limits we have
  \begin{align}
\lim_{n\to \infty}2\cdot\left(1+{j-k\above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}\right)&=2+\lim_{n\to \infty}\left({j-k\above 1.5pt |A_{n-1}|}\right)\\
&=2+0\\
&=2

I don't understand how we can define things when these are already known quantities. We've already got an exact definition for $e$ as $\lim_{n \to 0} (1+\frac{1}{n})^n$, and we've got $i = \sqrt{-1}$, and we've got $\cos$ and $\sin$ as the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of where right triangles meet the unit circle.

Is $e^{ix}$ simply being written in the slightly rearranged complex form $a + ib$ where $a = \cos(x)$ and $b = \sin(x)$?

If $\min f>0$, let $f$ takes the minimum value in $c_2$. Then    $f_{+}'(c_2)=\lim_{x\rightarrow c_1^+} \frac{f(x)-f(c_1)}{x-c_1} \geq 0$.

Joyce's decomposition of complex tensors,"This question/reference request is related to the books Compact manifolds with special holonomy , Riemannian holonomy groups and calibrated geometry and the paper Manifolds with many complex structures all by D. Joyce. In all of this there is the fallowing notation. Let $(M,J)$ be a complex manifold of real dimension $2m$. Fix some (real) coordinate chart $(U,x_1,...,x_{2m})$. Suppose we have a tensor $t=t^{a...}_{b...}$ i.e. $t=\sum_{a,...,b,...}\partial_{x_1} \otimes ...\otimes dx_b\otimes ...$ . Now he defines (tensors?) $$t^{\alpha ...}_{...}=\frac{1}{2}(t^{a ...}_{...}-i J^a_ct^{c ...}_{...}), \:\:t^{\overline{\alpha} ...}_{...}=\frac{1}{2}(t^{a ...}_{...}+i J^a_ct^{c ...}_{...})$$ $$t^{ ...}_{\beta ...}=\frac{1}{2}(t^{ ...}_{b...}-i J^c_bt^{ ...}_{c...}), \:\:t^{ ...}_{\overline{\beta} ...}=\frac{1}{2}(t^{ ...}_{b...}+i J^c_bt^{ ...}_{c...}).$$ The first question is whether one knows a reference for precise elaboration on that notation since in mentioned place I only found hardly this formulas. The second and most important question is how this correspond to the usual notation in which $Greek$ and $\overline{Greek}$ letters correspond to holomorphic and anti-holomorphic decomposition. Let me elaborate on that second question. For a fixed tensor t of type $(p,q)$ we have its decomposition into $2^{p+q}$ tensors being sections of $${T^{1,0}}^{P'}M \otimes {T^{1,0}}^{P''} M \otimes {{T^{1,0}}^*}^{Q'}M \otimes {{T^{1,0}}^*}^{Q''}M$$ where $P' \cup P'' = [p]$, $Q' \cup Q'' = [q]$ and $P',P'',Q',Q''$ actually indicate order in which $i$ and $-i$ eigenspaces are tensored. It seems to me (I would as well appreciate an easy reason for that) that for a fixed combination of bars and no-bars, $t^{\alpha \overline{\beta}...}_{\gamma \delta...}$ are coordinates for the tensor being a member of decomposition of $t$ corresponding to this ""type"" but still in coordinates $(U,x_1,...,x_{2m})$. Suppose now in addition that we have started with a holomorphic coordinates i.e. $x_j+ix_{m+j}$ are holomorphic coordinates. How are then this  $t^{\alpha ...}_{...}$ related to the components of $t$ in holomorphic coordinate i.e. with respect to $\partial_{z_j}, \partial_{\overline{z_j}}, dz_j, d\overline{z_j}$. For example for Hermitina metric $g$ is $g_{\alpha \overline{\beta}}$ in usual sense, i.e. $g=g_{\alpha \overline{\beta}}(dz_\alpha \otimes d\overline{z_\beta} + d\overline{z_\beta} \otimes dz_\alpha)$, the same as in the one defined in the beginning? Note that in formulas from the begging, Greek letters can be choose to be bigger than $m$ so it's probably not that this components are the same on the other hand latter in the book in case of holomorphic coordinates Joyce is using them as they were the same.","['complex-geometry', 'reference-request', 'differential-geometry']"
