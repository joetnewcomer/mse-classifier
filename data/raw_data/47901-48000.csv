483086,The set of all compact non-empty subsets is perfect,"Let $X$ be a perfect Polish space and let $H[X]$ be the set of all non-empty compact subsets of $X$. For $A,B \in H[X]$ define the so called Hausdorff-Distance $$
 d_H(A,B) = \max \{ \sup_{x \in X} \inf_{y\in Y} d(x,y), \sup_{y\in Y} \inf_{x \in X} d(x,y) \}
$$
which is a metric on $H[X]$, proof that $H[X]$ is perfect. I have to show that each open ball $B_{r}(A) = \{ B \in H[X] : d_H(A,B) < r \}$ contains a point $B \ne A$. For this I firstly wanted to show that the set (the set of points which have a distance $<r$ from $Y$)
$$
 Y_r = \bigcup_{y \in Y} \{ x \in X : d(x,y) < r \}
$$
contains a point not in $Y$. But I am unable to do. I have that $Y$ is compact, and because I am in a metric space so this is equivalent with $Y$ being closed and totally bounded. Guess it would be enough to show that the boundary of $Y$ is non-empty. So I tried, using totally bounded, to construct a sequence which approaches a point on the boundary, and then using closeness to deduce that it lies in $Y$, but I have now idea how to find such a sequence? Any hints? Btw my other post If a set could be represented as ""arbitrary fine"" finite union of open balls, then it is not closed is related to this question, but after the answers I don't have any ideas to proceed.","['general-topology', 'descriptive-set-theory', 'analysis']"
483093,Continued fraction with prime reciprocal entries,"We know that the reciprocals of the primes form a divergent series. We also know that a necessary and sufficient condition for a continued fraction to converge is that its entries diverge as a series. This leads me to wonder to what value this continued fraction converges: $$\tfrac{1}{2}+\cfrac1{\frac13 + 
\cfrac1{\frac15 + 
\cfrac1{\frac17 + 
\cfrac1{\frac1{11} + 
\cfrac1{\frac1{13} + \cdots
}}}}}
$$ I've already shown that the terms of the harmonic series, when placed in a continued fraction, do something nice, namely: $\left[1, 1, \tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{3},\tfrac{1}{4},\ldots\right] = \frac{\pi}{2}$. This prime reciprocal problem seems harder, though. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.","['prime-numbers', 'convergence-divergence', 'continued-fractions', 'number-theory']"
483096,Isomorphism of lattices,"This is an exercise that appears in some sheet of exercises in toric geometry. Take two lattices, $N=\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ and $N'=\operatorname{Span}_\mathbb{Z}\{(-1,-1,1), (-1,2,1), (2,-1,1)\}$. The exercise ask to show that the group $N/N'$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. I tried to do this constructing an homomorphism beetween $N$ and $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ whith kernel $N'$ and using the first homomorphism theorem, but I didn't reach the result. Then I found the relation, between the three generators of $N'$, say $u_{1},u_{2},u_{3}$, $u_{1}+u_{2}+u_{3}=(0,0,3)$, and so I tried to show that $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ are part of a basis of $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Doing so, I wanted to use $N/N'=(u_{1}\mathbb{Z}\oplus u_{2}\mathbb{Z}\oplus e_{3}\mathbb{Z})/(u_{1}\mathbb{Z}\oplus u_{2}\mathbb{Z} \oplus 3e_{3}\mathbb{Z})\simeq\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. But the point here is that $u_1$ and $u_2$ are not part of a basis of $\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, their wedge is proportional to $3$. Have you got any other idea? I'm sure that the result is right, because it's in an exercise. Thank you.","['group-theory', 'toric-geometry']"

483113,Weber-type integral,"In connection with this answer , I came across the following integral: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{du}{u} \: \,e^{-t u^2} \frac{J_0(u) Y_0(r u)-J_0(r u) Y_0(u)}{J_0^2(u)+Y_0^2(u)}$$ where $r \gt 1$.  I know this looks like an inverse Weber transform, but beyond the fact that the integrand has a name, I could not see how this could help.  Some context: 1) It turns out that $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{du}{u} \:  \frac{J_0(u) Y_0(r u)-J_0(r u) Y_0(u)}{J_0^2(u)+Y_0^2(u)} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ I know this is correct from the boundary conditions of the problem I solved.  Gradsteyn & Rhyzhik agree.  Of course, I did not derive this directly, so I have no hard proof. 2) Asymptotically, the integrand behaves as $$\frac{\sin{(r-1) u}}{\sqrt{r} u} e^{-t u^2}$$ This is very interesting, and somewhat expected.  While this is a solution in a 2D, radially-symmetric geometry, the solution of the analogous problem in 1D has an integrand of the form $(\sin{(x u)}/u)\, e^{-t u^2}$. 3) The integral produces a function resembling an error function. Anyway, any analytical evaluation of the integral that results in a faster evaluation of the result than my using numerical integration will get my appreciation.","['special-functions', 'integration', 'error-function']"

483153,Derivative of Integral (in Fourier transform),"I've taken some analysis, but somehow Fourier transforms were never brought up until they were assumed to be familiar.  Fun.  Anyway, in a class example (showing the integral of a Gaussian is again a Gaussian), the professor did the following step, which confused me.  By our definition we have
$$\hat{f}(\gamma):=\int f(t)e^{-2\pi i t\gamma}dt$$
from which we concluded
$$(\hat{f})'(\gamma)=-2\pi i \int t f(t) e^{-2\pi i t\gamma}dt$$ it would appear that he was using a ""theorem,"" that if $f(\gamma)=\int g(\gamma,t)dt$ then $f'(\gamma)=\int (\dfrac{d}{d\gamma} g(\gamma,t))dt$, but I'm not aware of any such theorem.  Is this true?  If so, is it supposed to be obvious, or does it have a name?  If not true, is there a simple argument as to why it's true here?

They are not unused to rigour, but might be a little daunted by too much of it. Therefore, I would like to do some serious mathematics with them, but with a view to get them interested in geometry/topology (They chose this topic based on advice from some older students). Some topics I had in mind were : a) Wallpaper patterns/Platonic solids and their symmetry groups b) Euler's theorem for polyhedra ($v-e+f = 2$) c) A gentle introduction to the fundamental group Could anyone suggest a good book to follow?

483191,Is $ds$ a differential form?,"I am somewhat confused as to whether $ds$ (line element) is actually a differential form... we have (in $\mathbb{R}^2$): $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$$ Differential 1-forms are supposed to be linear combinations of the $dx_i$, but the $ds$ shown above is definitely not a linear combination of $\{dx, dy\}$. So what is it? EDIT The link given in the comments seems to indicate that $ds$ is not a differential form. The following quote is from C. H. Edwards, ""Advanced Calculus of Several Variables"" section V.1 Given an oriented curve $C$ in $\bf R$, its arclength form $ds$   is defined for ${\bf x} \in C$ by
  $$ds_{\bf x}({\bf v}) = T({\bf x}) \cdot {\bf v}$$
  Thus $ds_{\bf x}({\bf v})$ is simply the component of ${\bf v}$ in the direction of the unit tangent vector $T({\bf x})$. It is clear that $ds_{\bf x}({\bf v})$ is a linear function of ${\bf v} \in {\bf R}^n$, so $ds$ is a differential form on $C$. Is the book wrong (or does ""is a differential form on $C$"" not mean ""is a differential form"" in general)?","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

483310,Cantor's Set Has No Intervals,"I'm asked to prove that the Cantor set has no intervals. This is what I've got: Let $(a,b)\subseteq [0,1]$, where $a<b$. Let $T=\{-\log_3(b-a)<n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. Now if $(a,b)\subseteq[0,1]$, then $b-a<1$, and so $-\log_3(b-a)>0$. This would then mean that $-\log_3(b-a)\in\mathbb{R}$, and so by the Archimidean property there exists some $\alpha\in T$ such that $a\leq \beta$ for all $\beta\in T$. Hence
$$-\log_3(b-a)<\alpha,$$
so we have know that
$$3^{-(-\log_3(b-a))}>3^{-\alpha}.$$
Of course the LHS here reduces the inequality as
$$b-a=\lvert b-a \rvert < 3^{-\alpha}.$$
Now $A_{\alpha}$ is the union of subsets of $[0,1]$ having length $3^{-\alpha}$, so $(a,b)\not\subseteq A_{\alpha}$; hence $(a,b)\not\subseteq C$, as was to be shown.

I have taken $N$ random values consistent with a probability function (in my test case it was a simple gaussian $p(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}Exp(-x^2)$) for which the cumulative PDF is $P(x) = Erf(x)$.

Also: $$f(x)\Delta x = F(x+\Delta x) - F(x) \tag{When $\Delta x$ gets closer to $0$}$$ I can also say that: $$\frac{d}{dx}F(x) = f(x)$$ So: $$dF(x) = f(x)dx$$ but $dF(x)$ can also be seen as $F(x+\Delta x) - F(x) \tag{When $\Delta x$ gets closer to $0$}$ So should $dx$ be considered $\Delta x \tag{When $\Delta x$ gets closer to $0$}$?

483933,Understanding a lemma in proof of Valuative Criteria of Separatedness,"I am reading this document here by Brian Osserman concerning the Valuative Criteria for properness and separatedness. In particular, I am trying to understand the second half of the proof Proposition 2.5. Here is the proposition: Proposition $\mathbf{2.5}$. Let $X$ be a scheme, and $x,x'\in X$ with $x$ specializing to $x'$. Then there exists a valuation ring $A$ and a morphism $\operatorname{Spec}A\to X$ with the generic point of $\operatorname{Spec}A$ mapping to $x$, and the closed point of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ mapping to $x'$. More generally, if $f:X\to Y$ is any morphism, and we have $x\in X$, and $y'\in Y$ a specialization of $f(x)$, then there exists a valuation ring $A$, with fraction field $K$, and a commutative diagram
  $$\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
\text{Spec }K @>>> X\\@VVV @VVfV\\ \text{Spec }A @>>> Y
\end{CD}$$
  such that the image of $\operatorname{Spec}K$ is $x$, and the generic and closed points of $\operatorname{Spec}A$ map to $f(x)$ and $y$ respectively. Now I can understand most of the proof (which is later in the document) except for the following reduction: Proof of Proposition 2.5. Note that the first statement follows from the second, by taking $f$ to be the identity map. For the second statement, by replacing $Y$ with the closure of $f(x)$ (with the reduced induced subscheme structure), it is clear that we may assume $Y$ is integral, and $f(x)$ is the generic point of $Y$. Then, by Proposition 3.1, there exists a valuation ring $A'$ of $K(Y)$ dominating My question is: Why can we assume that $Y$ is integral and that the $f(x)$ is the generic point of $Y$? It is clear to me that the map $f$ when restricted to $\overline{\{x\}}$ has image landing in $\{\overline{f(x)}\}$ (this is just continuity of $f$).",['algebraic-geometry']

It seemed to me that each result was actually one result PER choice of topology. But the course I did mostly focused on real space and the Euclidean topology, the boundedness principle and equivalence of norms. I admit all of these are practically useful, but they were not what made topology seem so interesting. My question is this: Are there any cases where we engineer an unusual topology with an eye to proving specific unobvious results. The work would then be in proving it is a topology, exactly what continuous functions look like, what compactness is and so on.

Formal proof of $h(x,y)=f(x)+g(y)$ has a critical point $(x_0,y_0)$ iff $x_0$ is a critical point of f and $y_0$ is a critical point of g Extra: $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and the same for g Firstly: It's obviously true, this took me by surprise because I'd have taken this without proof, I may have even used it before and considered it too trivial to question, f's change is independent of g's because one is in x and the other y. There should be a name for how useful of a property this is. I'm not even sure how to word it, you can think of the partials a the derivative of f along the x axis and derivative of g along the y axis, if one is turning (I sometimes call critical points turning points, it's how I was taught, is this wrong?) and the other isn't it's obviously not a critical point of the surface. It's difficult to explain, I just hope it's not so obscure someone suspects I'm bluffing, or that this is a part of that bluff and so forth, I hope no body things I have an odd numbered bluff! I'm a little thrown off by the if and only if part. I could use the second derivative test (and use the fact that $h_xy$ and $h_yx$ are both zero) but this is actually part 2 of the question, and if that were 0 requires further investigation involving the third derivatives, if that's 0, the fourth, I've proved this by induction before but only for single variables, the question is only worth 4 marks ~ 8 minutes at most. So yes, how would I prove this? additionally (this probably should have gone first) It does say critical, and the definition of that is ""first derivatives being zero"", I can show if this is true then it's a turning point? Then assume both derivatives are zero, and, well not sure, I thought integrate but I'm not entirely sure what I'd be integrating over, it's very hard to go back, I could say ""then the tangent plane is flat"" but then I'd have to prove if the tangent plane is flat that it's a critical point, I'm not certain of this (I know critical point => tangent plane is flat and I can't think of a counter example going the other way, in-fact the tangent plane is defined by the first derivatives, so perhaps this is the proof? It's fairly easy to show) Addendum No wonder I'm so muddled, no one looks at $f(x,y)=x+y$ as the sum of two functions, it's like the obvious limit ($\lim_{x\rightarrow a}(x)=a$) only I could prove that, is it not ""true because of the definition we use?"" and again, what are the both ways, the ""if then"" and ""only then"" parts?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

E(\sin^{-1}x~|~m) \equiv g_{re} (m) + \text{i} g_{im} (x,m)
$$
in the range $m>1$ and $1/\sqrt{m} \le x \le 1$. By using the Reciprocal Modulus Transformations (see DLMF section 19.7) and taking the limit $x\rightarrow 1/\sqrt{m}$, I have found the real parts to be: $$
f_{re}(m) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} K\left(\frac{1}{m}\right)
$$
$$
g_{re}(m) \equiv \sqrt{m} \left[ E \left( \frac{1}{m} \right) - K \left( \frac{1}{m} \right) \right] + \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} K\left(\frac{1}{m}\right)
$$ However, the imaginary parts $f_{im} (x,m)$, $g_{im} (x,m)$ escape me. I reckon there should be a way of expressing them in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals with parameters in the real valued range. If I use the reciprocal modulus transformations I will bring the parameter inside the range $0<m<1$ but the argument will now be complex as I will have $x>1$. I have looked everywhere in the literature but I can't seem to find any identity that solves the problem. I could perhaps do something if there was a way of expressing elliptic integrals of complex argument as a combination of elliptic integrals of real argument and imaginary pure argument, but I don't know how it can be done. Does someone have any insight on how those imaginary parts could be found?","['special-functions', 'elliptic-integrals', 'calculus', 'complex-analysis']"
