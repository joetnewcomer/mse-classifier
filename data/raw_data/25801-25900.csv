235097,Hasse Digram Leveling,"I have the following Hasse diagram for the divides relation on the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$. I felt that everything is in the right place, but my professor is saying that one of the elements is not on the correct level. I looked up some more information on how the levels work and it seems like the only condition is that if $x\preccurlyeq y $ then $x$ should be lower than $y$ in the Hasse diagram. With this in mind, I think that I can put $10$ on the same level as the $4,6,$ and $9$, but it doesn't seem incorrect to be where it is.

235139,Prove the LCM (Least Common Multiple).,"$\newcommand{\lcm}{\operatorname{lcm}}$ Let $m,n$ $\in$ $\Bbb N$.  The least common multiple ($\lcm$) of $m,n$ is the smallest natural number $x$, such that $m \mid x$ and $n \mid x$. Prove that the $\lcm$ of $m,n$ is equal to ${m,n\over \gcd(m,n)}$. Here is my proof so far: ${m,n\over \gcd(m,n)}$ is a common multiple of m and n . I am assuming that $q_m$ and $q_n$ are coprime. If $m = q_m \gcd(m,n)$ & $n = q_n \gcd(m,n)$, then ${m,n\over \gcd(m,n)}$ becomes ${q_m \gcd(m,n)q_n \gcd(m,n)\over \gcd(m,n)}$ which equals $q_m q_n \gcd(m,n)$. So, $m \mid q_m \gcd(m,n)q_n$ & $n \mid q_n \gcd(m,n)q_m$. Taking $x$ into consideration, $m \mid x$ and $n \mid x$, $x = k_1 m$ and $x = k_2 n$ which is $x = k_1 q_m \gcd(m,n)$ and $x = k_2 q_n \gcd(m,n)$.  Since $x$ is equal to itself, we set these equal to each other: $k_1 q_m \gcd(m,n) = k_2 q_n \gcd(m,n)$ $k_1 q_m = k_2 q_n$ ${k_1 \over q_n} = {k_2 \over q_m}$. So now I'm not really sure where to go from this point.  It doesn't really feel like I've proven anything at all... Update After using the suggestions below and amending my homework, I turned it in to my professor and he said absolutely none of what I said made any sense and refused to give me any homework points.  Without a doubt in my mind I believe that my answer was correct, or at least made sense, so I am leaving this question up here to assist other users.  I'm just forewarning you that my professor made it fairly clear to me that none of what I had written made any sense so please use this problem with caution.  Thank you to everyone that helped me better understand this proof, I really appreciated it.","['elementary-number-theory', 'least-common-multiple', 'gcd-and-lcm', 'discrete-mathematics']"
235147,Steps in Proof of Convolution Theorem,"I am reading a proof of the Convolution Theorem and don't understand this part: $$\int |f(z)|\int |g(z-x)| \, dx \, dz = \int|f(z)|\|g\|_1$$ Why does $\int |g(z-x)|dx = \|g\|_1$ ?",['functional-analysis']
235159,Need for axiom of choice?,"When you invoke the axiom of choice, it is because whatever you need to choose consists of small parts you technically have to choose one by one. So if I need to use the axiom of choice, but subsequently prove that no matter what I choose the end result is the same, is there really a need for the axiom of choice? This is where I bumped into the question: You have a set of abelian groups $G_i$ each with a given subgroup $H_i$, with $i\in I$ for some index set $I$. Show that the following isomorphism holds:
$$
\prod_{i\in I}\left(G_i/H_i\right) \approx\left(\prod_{i\in I}G_i\right)/\left(\prod_{i\in I}H_i\right).
$$
And here's my proof: An element in $g\in \prod_{i\in I}\left(G_i/H_i\right)$ is given by a (possibly infinite) tuple of elements of each quotient group. Each coordinate in the tuple is represented by an element $g_i$ in the corresponding $G_i$, which means that we can use the representatives to make an element in $\prod_{i\in I}G_i$ (this requires the axiom of choice if $I$ is big enough). Now, the difference between any two such elements is a tuple in $\prod_{i\in I}H_i$, so in the end what choice we make doesn't matter, any choice will give the same element in the final quotient group. But I still used the axiom to show that a representative existed, so my intuition says that this needs the axiom of choice, although I'm not certain. I use the word ""tuple"" here, because that's how I think of direct products. Representing the product as a function from the index set into the disjoint union (which is the proper way) will give a completely analogous reasoning.","['abstract-algebra', 'axiom-of-choice']"
235163,What is the Matrix corresponding to a Linear Transformation,"Given $T: P_2 \rightarrow P_3$ defined by: $T(at^2 + bt +c) = (a-b+c)t^3 + (-a + 3b - 2c)t^2 +(-a-b)t +(2b-c)$ What is the corresponding Matrix of $T$? This is what I have: First I rewrite the transformation as follows: $T_0 = 2b - c$ $T_1 = -a - b$ $T_2 = -a + 3b -2c$ $T_3 = a-b+c$ And I know $T_i = \sum \limits_{j=1}^n \mu_{ji} b_i$ where $b_i$ is the basis vector. So my matrix $\mu$ is $\pmatrix{0&-1&-1&1\\
                                2&-1&3&-1\\
                                -1&0&-2&1}$ Is this correct? Is my rewriting of $T$ correct?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'transformation']"
235170,Necessary condition for positive-semidefiniteness -- is it sufficient?,"Suppose that I have a symmetric square $n\times n$ matrix $A$ such that: $a_{ii}\geq 0$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$, and that $a_{ii}a_{jj} - a_{ij}^2 \geq 0$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$ and $i < j \leq n$. Clearly this is a necessary condition for positive semidefiniteness because of Sylvester's criterion, and the fact that $P^TAP$ is positive semidefinite for any positive semidefinite $A$ and permutation matrix $P$. This question hints that this condition is not sufficient. Can you list any simple counterexamples to the claim that this condition is sufficient for $A$ to be positive semidefinite? Thanks. P.S.

235180,Proof using Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality.,"This is a problem I am trying to solve for a couple of months without any success.

Denote by $L(f)$ the length of the polynomial and by $||.||_\infty$ the sup norm on $\{|z|\leq 1\}$. So for $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\ldots +a_nx^n , L(f)=|a_0|+|a_1|+\ldots+|a_n|$ and $||f||_\infty=\sup{\{|f(z)|:|z|\leq 1\}}.$ The problem is: If $f(x)\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ then $$L(f)\leq \sqrt{1+n} ||f||_\infty.$$","['inequality', 'complex-analysis']"

For $\mathfrak{p} \in D_+(f)$, let $\psi(\mathfrak{p})=\mathfrak{p}S_f\cap S_{(f)}$.

Also, when we diagonalize matrix A=$S\lambda S^{-1}$, the eigenvector matrix S is not unique. It means if we multiply each column of S by nonzero constant we can make a new $S'$. Why is that?

235621,Is this subvariety affine?,"Consider the following algebraic variety $X$: Let $C\subset\mathbb{A}^3$ be the affine variety cut out by $xy-z^2=0$ (i.e. the affine cone over a projective conic). Let $B=\mathbb{A}^2$, with coordinate functions $x',z'$. Identify $C\setminus \{x=0\}$ with $B\setminus \{x'=0\}$ by the map $(x,y,z)\mapsto (x'^{-1},z')$.  Then let $X$ be $B\cup C$. Now I believe that $y$ and $z$ (coordinate functions on $C$) extend to global sections on $X$. Therefore $y-z$ is a global section. My question is this: Is the open subvariety $D(y-z)=\{p\in X\mid y(p)-z(p)\neq 0\}$ affine? Some background (you can ignore this): Why do I care about this question? My original motivation was that I was wondering if in general, for an arbitrary variety $X$, the set of $f\in \mathcal{O}_X(X)$ such that $D(f)$ is affine is an ideal of $\mathcal{O}_X(X)$, since it seems to me it is closed under multiplication by $\mathcal{O}_X(X)$. But I couldn't think of a reason for it to be closed under addition. I made up the variety $X$ in this question as a random test case. Then I realized I didn't have a way to check affineness. I now assume that the set of such $f$ is not an ideal in general, or somebody would already have answered this question. But I still hope to learn the answer, because I want to understand how I would determine affineness in this case. Why do I think $C\setminus\{x=0\}$ and $B\setminus\{x'=0\}$ are isomorphic? Because the coordinate rings are, respectively, $\left(k[x,y,z]/(xy-z^2)\right)_x$ and $k[x',z']_{x'}=k[x',x'^{-1},z']$.  But $\left(k[x,y,z]/(xy-z^2)\right)_x$ is generated over $k$ by $x,x^{-1},y,z$ and $y$ satisfies $y=x^{-1}z^2$, so this is the ring $k[x,x^{-1},z]$. Then $x'\mapsto x^{-1},z'\mapsto z$ is an isomorphism of the rings. Why do I think $y,z$ extend to global sections? The complement of $C$ in $X$ is the line $x'=0$ in $B$; this is where the functions need to be defined in order to become global sections.

I've seen from this answer that when the distribution is symmetric, they are uncorrelated, which makes it zero.

However, I want to find the exact value of $Cov(M,S^2)$ , as I am working with small values of $\lambda$ Currently I tried the following: $Cov(M,S^2) =E( (M-\lambda) (S^2-\lambda) ) = E(MS^2)-\lambda E(M) - \lambda E(S^2) + \lambda^2$ Thus, $Cov(M,S^2) = E(MS^2) - \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 + \lambda^2  = E(MS^2) -\lambda^2$ I am having trouble with calculating $E(MS^2)$ .

If $\mu$ was a positive measure, this would follow from a version of Besicovitch's Differentiation Theorem, see Theorem 2.22 in Functions of Bounded Variation and Free Discontinuity Problems by Ambrosio, Fusco, Pallara.
In the general case I could imagine that two positive, singular continuous measures could be used to give a counterexample, but I haven't been able to construct them. Edit: I was thinking about a middle-half Cantor probability distribution as positive part and as negative part a probability measure constructed in the following way: At step $n$ of the construction of the Cantor set we have $2^n$ intervals of length $4^{-n}$ left; consider the two intervals next to each of these intervals, also of length $4^{-n}$ and uniformly distribute weight on them in order to get a probability measure. The weak*-limit of those measures shall constitute the negative part. - I'm rather convinced that the resulting signed measure has pointwise Radon-Nikodým derivative 0, but I fear that in the end it's the zero measure, so both constructions (of positive and negative part) give the same measure.

I am fine with the intuitive (and hand-wavy) method of computing the divisor of zeros (of $x$) by saying something like, ""the line $x=0$ intersects $X$ at a single point with multiplicity 2, and so the coefficient of the point defined by their intersection (an irreducible codimension 1 subvariety) is 2."" I'm having trouble proving this in complete rigor using the definitions provided. In particular, if I have an irreducible codimension 1 subvariety $C$ in mind, I want to choose an affine open set $U \subset X$ intersecting $C$ and look at the local equation $\pi$ of $C$ in $U$. Here the ideal of $C$ in $U$ would hence be $(\pi)$, and necessarily for any $f \in k[U]$ there would be a maximal $m$ for which $f \in (\pi^m)$. The valuation of $f$ (and the coefficient of $C$ in the divisor) is defined to be $m$. So I'm trying this with $C$ simply defined by $x=0$ (as a subvariety/point of $X$). The obvious affine chart is $y=1$, and then $k[U] = k[x,z]/(x-z^2)$. So now $x \in k[U]$, and it is its own local equation. However, it appears that $x \in (x)$, but $x \not \in (x^2) = (z^4)$, so the coefficient of $C$ would be 1. This obviously doesn't fit with my intuitive understanding of how to compute the divisor of a rational function.

I thought I had a pretty good grasp on Expectations but apparently I could still use some clarification. Hopefully someone can help me. Suppose that $n$ people take a blood test for a disease, where each person has probability $p$ of having the disease, independent of other persons. To save time and money, blood samples from $k$ people are pooled together. If none of the $k$ persons has the disease then the test will be negative, but otherwise it will be positive. If the pooled test i sportive then each of the $k$ persons is tested separately (so $k+1$ tests are done in that case) Let $X$ be the number of tests required for a group of $k$ people. Show that $$

236231,Functional Interpretation of Variety?,"I am simultaneously taking courses in functional analysis and commutative algebra.  In doing so, I found that there is, at least heuristically, some similarity between the notion of an algebraic variety (essentially, the zero locus of a family of polynomials) and the annihilator of a subspace of a Banach space (the collection of continuous functionals that ""kill"" the subspace).  In doing some reading, I came upon the Banach-Stone theorem, which implies that the algebra of scalars is an analogue of the structure sheaf of a ring, and is evidently an essential ingredient in non-commutative geometry (thank you, Wikipedia). One finds a one-to-one correspondence between finitely generated nilpotent free k-algebras and affine varieties by first asking what algebraic structure (finitely generated nilpotent free k-algebra) corresponds to the geometric object (affine variety).  Then, inspecting what sort of geometric object gives the correspondence with the more general commutative rings, we find schemes. This analogue of a structure sheaf makes me think that there might be analogous sort of correspondence in the Banach algebra setting.  Is this the case?  If so, can anybody provide some references, interesting papers, etc?","['noncommutative-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'banach-algebras', 'banach-spaces']"

236264,What are the morphisms $\mathcal{O}_X\to k_p$ on a variety $X$?,"Let $X$ be a variety over a field $k$ (we always assume $k=\bar k$, but I think this doesn't matter here), and let $k_p$ denote the skyscraper sheaf on $X$ w.r.t. the point $p\in X$. I want to find all the morphisms from the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ to $k_p$. I know that the answer is that there are only the evaluation morphisms, i.e., morphisms of the form $\phi\mapsto\phi(p)$ on open subsets that contain $p$, but I don't really see why. First of all, wouldn't I need to know which kind of morphisms I am looking for? That is, morphisms of sheaves of abelian groups, or $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules, or... But from the very short solution I have here, I think that the $\mathcal{O}_X$-module one is being searched for. So let $U$ be an open subset which contains $p$ (otherwise $k_p(U)=0$ and there is only the zero map). Then we took $\frac{g}{h}\in\mathcal{O}_X(U)$, and if $f$ is the wanted morphism we must have $f_U(\frac{g}{h})=\frac{g}{h}(p)\cdot f_U(1_U)=\frac{g}{h}(p)\cdot f_X(1_X)$. I really don't quite understand this calculation. My guess: the $\mathcal{O}_X$-module structure on $k_p$ should be given by $\mathcal{O}_X(U)\to k_p(U)=k$, $\phi\mapsto\phi(p)$, and then we'd have to pull out $\frac{g}{h}$ as above. But why is this the 'canonical' structure (I searched my notes for something regarding this, but there is nothing which mentions this structure)? And why do we have to use that $f_U(1)=f_X(1_X)$ at all? Thanks in advance!","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
