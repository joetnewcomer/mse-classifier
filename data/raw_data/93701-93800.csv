1280222,Ordinals - motivation and rigor at the same time,Can someone provide a description of ordinals within ZFC in a rigorous way that exhibits motivation? Every description or explanation I see in the literature or on the Internet is either too formal with no motivation provided or too simple with no rigor. I've been truly baffled by the concept of ordinals for the last couple days.,"['motivation', 'elementary-set-theory', 'ordinals', 'logic', 'intuition']"

My question is: Given a group $G$, can this group always be viewed as an algebraic group? From the comments below, I am pretty sure that O don't mean a topological group.

We all know that this can't be a group because any group of order $5$ is abelian but according to my definition this group is not abelian. But my question is why can't this be a group when it satisfies all the criteria mentioned in the definition of a group. I wish to find a reason for its ability of not being a group just from the definition of group. For example one can say that the diagonal elements are $1$, which means we have subgroups of order $2$, which is not possible for a group of order $5$. But this is not what I am seeking. Please explain me using nothing more than just the four criteria of the definition of group.",['group-theory']

A point $x$ in $X$ is said to be a limit point of $A$ provided that every open set containing $x$ contains a point $A$ different from $x$.

What I tried is the following: Each component of $w_i$ is a scalar Gaussian, with zero mean and variance $1/\alpha$. Moreover, these components are independent due to the form of the covariance matrix of the joint distribution. I tried to form the distribution of the following linear combination of deterministic vectors: $$ Y = \sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m\Phi_m$$. $\Phi_m$ is the $m.$ column of the matrix $\Phi$.

I know that the LB eigenvalue problem for unit circle is equivalent to the regular Laplacian eigenvalue problem for  the interval of the length $2\pi$ with periodic Boundary conditions. In a sense, the LB operator on circle can be viewed as a Laplacian of a function depending on the arc length. 
Therefore the eigenvalues of LB operator on a circle of arbitrary radius will be equal to the eigenvalues of unit circle LB, rescaled by the square of the radius.

1280701,Proof of uniqueness of conditional expectation,"I have a question on the proof Durrett (p. $190$) gives for the uniqueness of the conditional expectation function. If I understand his proof correctly, here is what I think it is saying: Suppose $Y, Y'$ both satisfy the criteria to be a conditional expectation function for a random variable $X$ given a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$.  Then if $A_{\epsilon} := \{ \omega \mid Y - Y' \geq \epsilon \}$, clearly $A_{\epsilon} \in \mathcal{A}$, and so by the criteria we have for conditional expectation, we have: $$0 = \int \limits_{A_{\epsilon}} Y - Y' \,dP \geq \epsilon P(A_{\epsilon}) \geq 0$$ and this shows that $P(A_{\epsilon}) = 0$ for all $\epsilon > 0$. Ok, then we note that $0 \leq P( \{\omega \mid Y - Y' > 0 \} ) = P(\bigcup \limits_{n =1}^{\infty} A_{\frac{1}{n}}) \leq \sum \limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} P(A_{\frac{1}{n}}) = \sum \limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} 0 = 0$.  Thus, $P( \{\omega \mid Y - Y'  \leq 0 \} ) = 1$, so $Y \leq Y'$ almost surely. We can repeat the same proof switching $Y$ and $Y'$ to get $Y' \leq Y$ almost surely, thus they are equal almost surely. My question : I think the following proof is a much simpler one (using the fact that $\int \limits_{\Omega} X \,dP = 0 \implies X = 0$ almost surely).  Is there any flaw in the argument below?  If not, why did Durrett decide to do so many extra steps? Since $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$, we have $0 = \int \limits_{\Omega} Y - Y' \,dP$, and thus $Y - Y' = 0$ almost surely, so $Y = Y'$ a.s.","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'measure-theory']"

1280799,Integration Around Part of a Branch Cut,"I am studying the integral, given by a Laplace transform, $$\int_0^\infty\!e^{-\alpha x}\sinh^{-2/3}x\left(1+\frac 12\sinh^2x\right)^{-1/6}\left(1-\beta\sinh^{4/3}x\right)^{1/2}\,\mathrm dx$$ From what I can tell there are three singularities:  one at $x = 0$ (from the second term in the integrand) and two at $x = \pm\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2$ (from the third term).  The only multi-valued term should be the third term since $$\left(1+\frac 12 \sinh^2x\right)^{-1/6} = \left(x-\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2\right)^{-1/6}\left(x+\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2\right)^{-1/6}$$ and the hyperbolic functions are single-valued.  This means I can set up my branch cut along the real axis in the range $x\in\left(-\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2,\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2\right)$, but this makes the choice of contour really confusing.  This integral is not symmetric under the transformation $x\to -x$ or anything else as far as I can see. Here's my question: What is a good choice for a contour for this integral?  Would it even include any of the three poles if it does not go around the branch cut? FIRST EDIT: From what I understand, when hyperbolic functions are involved it is good to use a rectangular contour and exploit symmetries.  Here it would be $\sinh x = \sinh(x+2\pi i)$ and a good contour would be from $i\epsilon$ to $2\pi i$ to $R+2\pi i$ to $R+i\epsilon$ and back along the real axis, taking the limits as $\epsilon\to 0$ and $R\to\infty$. Some new questions with respect to this revelation:  do I pick up a quarter of the residue at the origin?  And am I correct that the branch point at $\sin^{-1}\sqrt 2$ does not contribute any residue?  How is the limit $\epsilon\to 0$ different along the branch cut vs past it? SECOND EDIT: After further study (and the limited help of Mathematica) it turns out this integral is filled with branch points.  See the picture below. Notice how I've connected pairs to form short, finite-length branch cuts which can be integrated around.  This now means there are no removable singularities where the residues may be picked up.  Instead, the path I've previously described needs to be extremely deformed in order to close the contour.  The main concept which confuses me now is how you would integrate over half a dumbbell/dogbone contour (see the branch cut along the portion of the real axis) when the contour continues further past it.","['branch-points', 'contour-integration', 'laplace-transform', 'integration', 'branch-cuts']"

Show that $\varphi$ is monotonic. This becomes rather straight-forward if we further assume the $f$ is continuously differentiable, or even locally Lipschitz continuous, as this implies that IVP for $x'=f(x)$ enjoy uniqueness, and hence if $f\big(\varphi(t_0)\big)=0$, for some $t_0\in J$, then $\varphi$ is constant. In fact something stronger holds in such case: $\varphi$ is either strictly monotonic or constant. This problem is also straight-forward if $f(x)\ne 0$, for all $x\in I$, in which case uniqueness kicks in anew. The hard part is to show monotonicity of $\varphi$ when $f$ is just continuous, and its values include zero.","['analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1280814,Are convex functions of a random variable themselves random variables?,"I was looking at proofs of Jensen's inequality and noticed that they usually assume that for a convex function $g$ and a random variable $X$, the expression $\mathbb{E}(g(X))$ is well defined, which implies that $g(X)$ is a random variable. I was thinking whether it was possible that all real-valued functions of random variables are random variables themselves, which is why the proofs skip the step of proving that $g(X)$ is a random variable. But then I thought if $A$ is a Borel set, then $(g \circ X)^{-1}(A) = X^{-1}(g^{-1}(A)) $ may not itself be $\mathcal{F}$-measurable  if $g^{-1}(A)$ is not Borel. But it is true if convex functions $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are $\mathcal{B}$-measurable. Is it true that all convex functions are $\mathcal{B}$-measurable, then? I know the sub-level sets of a convex function are convex, so if we can show that a convex set is Borel, that would work too.

1280821,Parametric equation of clock hands,"I am trying to draw a clock with both hour and minute hands in a computer program. The movement of the clock hands would mirror a traditional wall clock (hours from $12, 1, 2, 3,..., 11$ and back to $12$ etc.) Suppose I know the center (starting point) and the radii of both the hour and the minute hands. In order to locate the endpoints (tip) of the clock hands, what parametric equation I should use? The complication seems to be that the hour hands start from $12$ (or we could assume it's ""$0$"") at the top of the clock. So, the traditional parametric equation for finding a point around a circle's circumference (see below) needs to be modified a bit here. If I get the hour hand equation down, I think I can adapt it for minute hand. My trig knowledge isn't that good, so if someone could provide me a solution (or even just a clue), that'd be very helpful. Thank you! The conventional parametric equations of a circle are: \begin{align}
x &= r \cos(t)\\
y &= r \sin(t)
\end{align}
where $r$ is the radius and $t$ is in radian for above equations. I found a document that derives how to graph the hour and minute hands, but the equations there (pasted below) doesn't seem to draw at least the hour hand right. For example, from $12$ to $3$ hour, it draws points in the fourth quadrant of a circle... \begin{align}
x &= r \cos(\frac\pi{360}t)\\
y &= r \sin(\frac\pi{360}t)

1281184,Integral Inequality Proof Using Hölder's inequality,"I'm working on the extra credit for my Calculus 1 class and the last problem is a proof. We have done proofs before, but I'm unsure of how to approach this problem. Any help would be much appreciated, I'm just not entirely sure how to start. Specifically, showing how the continuous function defined by the problem is to taken into account. I understand that it defines the bounds for the integrals, but beyond that I am unsure of how they are affected. My intuition tells me that it implies the use of a specific theorem, but no specific theorem is apparent to me from simple observation. I've found evidence that Holder's Inequality would be helpful, but I'm not certain as to how to apply this. The problem is as follows: Show that for any continuous function $f:[-1,1]\to\mathbb R$ we have that: $$2\int_{-1}^{1} f^2(x) dx \ge \left(\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)dx\right)^2+3\left(\int_{-1}^{1}xf(x)dx\right)^2$$ I've tried multiple approaches essentially yielding nothing though. My understanding of how to manipulate integrals in a general manner is weak at best. I did get a hint from my TA that said the proof is almost a page long and uses results beyond Calculus 1, so technically I shouldn't even be able to do this proof, but it is worth a significant amount of my grade and I could really use all the help I can get. We actually only started integrals about 3 weeks ago. Not to mention it has now started to bother me that I can't solve it despite spending so much time.

1281267,Is there a mathematical way to fold a $20 dollar bill for compactness?,"I had a strange thought. I used to carry a pill fob on my keys with an emergency $20 bill in it, before the whole thing got stolen. I always had some trouble fitting the bill inside the fob and barely managed it each time.  I would fold it a couple times then roll it really tight and put it into the tube before it expanded. Imagine that I don't have the restriction of needing a tube. I know to minimize volume a sphere is best, but you can't fold a paper into a sphere, something about Gaussian Curvature. Is there a math formula or technique where a bill can be folded maximally?

$$
  L  = \frac{\pi t}{6}(2^n + 4)(2^n - 1)

Could anyone give me some hint for finding an explicit form for the expression involving $u$? I feel like my approach is not quite correct... First I know the term in the limit is bounded
$$
\begin{aligned}
\eqref{\star} & \leq \int_{\mathbb R^N} \left( \frac{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert}{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p}\right)^{p-1} \left\lvert \nabla v \right\rvert \,dx

\\ 
& = \left\| \nabla u \right\|_p^{1-p}\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p^{p-1} \left\| \nabla v\right\|_p 
\\
& = \left\| \nabla v\right\|_p.
\end{aligned}
$$
with the additional assumption that $ \nabla v \in L^\infty\!\left(\mathbb R^N, \mathbb R^N\right)$. Define the set 
$$
D:= \big\{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert \leq \|\nabla u \|_\infty -\delta\big\},$$
the limit $\eqref{\star}$ is zero on the set $D$. To see this, we know there exists $N\in \mathbb N$ such that 
$$\left|\, \left\|\nabla u \right\|_\infty - \left\|\nabla u \right\|_p \,\right| \leq \frac{\delta}{2} \quad \forall \; p\geq N.$$
On the set $D$ we have 
$$ \left\|\nabla u \right\|_p - \left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert  \geq \frac{\delta}{2} \quad \forall \; p\geq N$$
which means 
$$\frac{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert}{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p}  \leq 1 - \frac{\delta}{2} \quad \forall \; p\geq N$$
and the term in the limit $\left(\dfrac{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert}{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p}\right)^{p-2}$ goes to $0$ uniformly. Next I looked at the set $K: = \big\{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert = \left\|\nabla u \right\|_\infty\big\}$, the term 
$$
\left(\frac{\left\lvert \nabla u \right\rvert}{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p}\right)^{p-2} = \left(\frac{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_\infty}{\left\| \nabla u \right\|_p}\right)^{p-2}
$$
is in the form $``1^\infty""$, so I tried to use L'Hopital's rule. And we can calculate the limit (assuming the integrals are defined and finite, I just want to see what the limit might look like). 
$$

  for every set $E\subset X$. ($\overline{E}$ denotes the closure of $E$.) Proof: Suppose $x\in \overline{E} = E\cup E'$, where $E'$ is the set of limit points of $E$. If $x\in E$, then $f(x)\in f(E)\subset \overline{f(E)}$ and we are done. Now suppose $x\in E'$ and let $\epsilon >0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a $\delta >0$ such that $d(x,y)<\delta$ implies $$d(f(x),f(y))<\epsilon. $$
Since $x$ is a limit point of $E$, there is a neighborhood $N_{\delta}(x)$ of radius $\delta$ about $x$ such that $(N_{\delta}(x)\setminus \{x\}) \cap E \neq \emptyset$. Then $p\in N_{\delta}(x)$ implies that $d(f(x),f(p))<\epsilon$. Hence, for any $\epsilon >0$, we can always find a $\delta$ such that
$$\left( N_{\epsilon}(f(x)) \setminus \{f(x)\}\right) \cap f(E) \neq \emptyset.$$ 
Thus $f(x)\in f(E)'\subset \overline{f(E)}$.

$$ I understand he used Bayes' Rule to get the RHS equation, but fail to see how he did this. If somebody could provide a breakdown of the application of the rule in this problem that would be great.","['probability', 'bayes-theorem']"

1281506,Probability of dice with a cumulative successes,"Needing some Math help! I'm working out part of a system for a game I'm working on, and I need to know if I need to tweak some things, so I'm checking to see if it all adds up (no pun intended). defender has a base of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 11 for the target successes that the attacker has to roll; if the attacker achieves the # of successes required the attacker wins the roll, otherwise the defender wins.
the attacker rolls 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 10-sided dice based on his/her increasing skill, however only 8-10 count as a success, and each 9-10 granting an additional die to add to the pool. That means, there is a 3/10 chance of at least one success, and 1/5 chance to add another die, to increase the chance for the attacker to hit the defender's number. I feel like this should be really easy, but I can't figure out how to get started...
What is the chance (expressed as a ratio please...) for the attacker to win the roll against a defender with a target of 1? a target of 3, 5, 7, 11?","['dice', 'probability', 'statistics']"

1281581,A matrix representation for the inverse matrix.,"I have a problem from ""Methods of Algebriac Geometry in Control Theory by Peter Falb"" textbook: Show that if $A$ is $\,n\times n\,$ matrix, then $\displaystyle\,(zI-A)^{-1} = \sum_{j=1}^n \phi_j\left(z\right) A^{n-j} \big/ \det\left[zI-A\right]$. Compute $\phi_j\left(z\right)$. I am using the following formula:
$$
{\left(zI-A\right)}^{-1} = 
\frac{1}{\det \left(zI-A\right)}
\sum_{s=0}^{n-1}\left(zI-A\right)^{s}
\sum_{k_1,k_2,\ldots ,k_{n-1}}
\prod_{l=1}^{n-1} \frac{\left(-1\right)^{k_l+1}}{l^{k_l}\,k_{l}!}\,
\left(\operatorname{tr}\left(zI-A\right)^l\right)^{k_l}
$$ 
where the second summation is over $\displaystyle\,j+\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}lk_l=n-1$.
But I don't see how to find $\,\phi_j\left(z\right)$. Can anyone help me on this?
Thanks in advance. P.S

1281710,Prove that $\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil =\left \lfloor \frac{n+m-1}{m} \right\rfloor$,"On a discrete mathematics past paper, I must prove that $$\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil = \left\lfloor \frac{n+m-1}{m} \right\rfloor$$ for all integers $n$ and all positive integers $m$. I have started a proof by induction thus: Let $P(m,n)$ be the statement that $$\left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil = \left\lfloor \frac{n+m-1}{m} \right\rfloor$$ for all integers $n$ and all positive integers $m$. Then, according to the technique described here , I must prove the following: Base case: I have already proved that $P(a,b)$, where $a=1$ and where $b$ is the smallest value where $n$ is valid.  (Note that this is equivalent to proving that $\lceil n \rceil = \lfloor n \rfloor \space \forall\space n\in\mathbb{Z}.$) Induction over $m$: I must show that $P(k,b) \implies P(k+1,b)$ for some positive integer $k$.  THIS IS THE STAGE AT WHICH I AM STUCK. Induction over $n$: I must show that $P(h,k) \implies P(h,k+1)$ for some positive integer $m$ and for some integer $k$ (I think that I must account for the fact that $k$ could be negative OR non-negative). I will explain why I am stuck. My inductive hypothesis is that $P(k,b)$ - that is, $\left\lceil \frac{b}{k}\right\rceil = \left\lfloor \frac{b+k-1}{k}\right\rfloor$. I want to show that this implies $P(k+1,b)$.  I have tried to do this by attempting to express $\lceil \frac{b}{k+1} \rceil$ in terms of $\left\lceil \frac{b}{k} \right\rceil$, but have not succeeded.

1281753,Why are cochains in group cohomology exact as a functor of the coefficients?,"I am stuck with exercise $1$ of section $3$ of chapter $1$ in the book Cohomology of number fields by Neukirch. The exercise is to show that the functor from $A \rightarrow C^n(G,A)$ is exact, where $G$ is a profinite group and $A$ is a $G$ module. By definition $C^n(G,A)=X^n(G,A)^G$. Here $X^n(G,A)$ is defined to be continuous map from $G^{n+1}$ to $A$ with discrete topology on $A$. Now from page $32$ of the same book  using  proposition $1.3.7$, I deduce that $X^n(G,A)=X^n(G,Ind_G(A))^G$ that is I get that $C^n(G,A)=({X^n(G,Ind_G(A))^G})^G$. But $(-)^G$ is left exact and I know that $A \rightarrow Ind_G(A)$ is exact. I am lost after that.
