1536234,Correlation Coefficient as Cosine,"I've read that the correlation coefficient between two random variables may be viewed as the cosine as the angle between them, but I can't find any solid explanation. To be concrete, let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ with correlation coefficient $\rho$.  Assume $X,Y \in L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$.  The quantity $\rho$ is defined as
$$
\rho := \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)Var(y)}}.
$$
Letting $\mu_X := E(X)$ and $\mu_Y := E(Y)$, note
$$
Cov(X,Y) = E((X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)) = \left< X - \mu_X, Y - \mu_Y\right>_{L^2}
$$
and
$$
Var(X) = E((X - \mu_X)^2) = ||X - \mu_X||_{L^2}^2,
$$
where $L^2 := L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$.  Thus
$$
\rho = \frac{\left< X - \mu_X, Y - \mu_Y\right>_{L^2}}{||X - \mu_X||_{L^2} ||Y - \mu_Y||_{L^2}}. \qquad (1)
$$
Compare this with the Euclidean space inner product result that for two vectors $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{x^Ty}{||x||\, ||y||},
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $x$ and $y$. The recurring claim I read is that I can think of $\rho$ as the cosine of the ""angle"" between the two random variables, but it seems it only makes sense in terms of $L^2$ inner products.  But in that case, the only notion of ""angle"" between to elements $X,Y \in L^2$ I can think of is
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\left< X,Y \right>_{L^2}}{||X||_{L^2} ||Y||_{L^2}}. \qquad (2)
$$ So, two questions: Is Eqn. (2) a valid notion of angle in $L^2$? Are Eqns (1) and (2) somehow equlivalent? If both of these are true, I can justify viewing $\rho = \cos(\theta)$.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

But I am interested in the higher dimensional case. Let's consider the case of a curve $C$ intersects with a divisor $D$ (codimension 1). For what I can understand, saying that $C\cdot D<0$ in particular means that the curve $C$ is contained in $D$. Is it true? Is it the definition in some sense? Moreover, which is the geometrical information contained in $C\cdot D=-k$ for $k>0$ (I am thinking in the case in which $C\cdot D=-2$ for example). Thank you very much for any hint, advice and suggestion. And of course references will be very welcome (I was trying to read Eisenbud and Harris '3264 & Intersection Theory', but I cannot realise this situation...)!

Somewhere else I instead found that a k-cycle is only irreducible.

1537534,Approximating a discrete measure with a continuous one,"In physics it is common to approximate distributions of point masses or charges with continuous distributions. To do this, one typically defines a density function by moving throughout the space a test volume containing many points. In more refined approaches, one can consider the asymptotic behaviour of the average density while enlarging the test volume. From the point of view of measure theory — if I understand it correctly — this would mean constructing a continuous measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from a discrete one, so that the continuous measure can be considered, in some sense, an approximation of the discrete one. Is there any standard, formal, way to do such a construction in measure theory? Given the comments below, I reckon that my question above is not clear enough. Here are a few additional remarks: For discrete measure, I mean a measure $\mu$ for which there exists a countable set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that its complement is a set of  measure zero, $\mu(\complement A) = 0$. Thus, if $A = \{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$, the measure can be represented as $\mu = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\delta_{x_k}$, where $\delta_{x_k}$ is the Dirac's measure centred in $x_k$. I would consider both finite and countably infinite sets, because we usually like to speak also of unbounded bodies (e.g. a line of charge). As suggested by @zhoraster in the comments, the first step of the construction is naturally that of weighing (averaging, smoothing) the discrete distribution with a smooth weighing function $\varphi(x)$, normalized so that
$$\int\varphi(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = 1.$$
This approach is, for instance, well described in G. Russakoff, ""A derivation of the macroscopic Maxwell equations"" , Am. J. Phys. , 38 , 1188 (I recalled the existence of this paper just today). What I think is missing, from a mathematical point of view, in the given reference and in other treatments is the following. Physicists tend to assume, more or less tacitly (see e.g. also the treatment of the macroscopic Maxwell equations given by Jackson in his Classical electrodynamics ), that the continuous distribution (measure) obtainable by the smoothing process is somehow independent of the chosen weighing function, if its effective volume is large enough to contain many points. I think that the critical point is this one, not that of weighing: so, is there any standard proof in measure theory showing that through a process of smoothing we can obtain a well-defined continuous measure? Maybe I'm overthinking all the above process and things are really much more trivial, but any clarification or pointer to references will be appreciated.","['physics', 'distribution-theory', 'mathematical-physics', 'measure-theory']"

Using a formula, define a function $f:A\to B$ which is surjective but not injective.  Prove that your function is surjective but not injective. A possible function that may meet this requirement that I chose is: $f(x)=2\sin(\pi x - 3\pi)$ This is surjective, and not injective. I can prove that it is not injective easily, by using a counterexample. For example, I can just show that $f(3)=f(5)=0$, and $3\neq 5$. The part that I need help on is proving that it is surjective. Here is what I have so far: Claim: $f $ is surjective . Pf : A function is surjective by definition if for every $b\in B$, there is some $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$.
Our function $f$ has a range of $[-2,2]$ when the domain is all real numbers. When the domain is $[3,6]$, the image will be still $[-2,2]$. This means that for every $b \in B$, there is some $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$. Thus, we have proved directly that $f$ is surjective. This proof seems incomplete, or inneffecient.

I've plotted this using software, and it seems it's true. But I've been struggling to prove this. Does anyone have clues? Thanks. Edited: I'm adding information as to roughly map out how I've tried. Please see below. First, based on basic calculus. I tried to think about functions rather than sequences, and show that both functions increase, but the former at a higher rate. To elaborate more, $f(x) := 1 - \frac{1}{x}$ and $g(x) := (1 - \frac{1}{x})^x$ Showing $f(x)$ is increasing is easy. Took the derivative of it, and it is always positive for all $x$. The value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ and its slope $f'(x)$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ at $x=2$. What remains is to show (1) the value of $g(x)$ is less than or equal to $f(0.5) = 0.5$; (2) the slope of $g(x)$ is less than or equal to $f'(0.5) = 0.25$, and (3) the rate at which the slope increases is less than $f''(x)$. $g(0.5) = 0.25 < f(0.5) = 0.5$ (1) is done. Now (2) and (3) to go. Showing $g(x)$ is increasing is hard. Took the logarithm of it, and tried to take the derivative of it, but to no avail. This is pretty much it so far.

Suppose that $a \leq b \leq c$: $d(a,b) = \dfrac{b}{a} \leq \dfrac{c}{b}\cdot \dfrac{c}{a}$ since we're working with positive numbers here and can cancel $a$, and bring $b$ to the upper LHS to give equivalently $b^2 \leq c^2$.  But the RHS equals $d(b,c)\cdot d(a,c)$. The condition $a\leq b$ is WLOG for our purposes which isn't necc. easy to see, so give me just this one to make the proof simpler.  Now all we need to check are the cases $a \leq c \leq b$ and $c \leq a \leq b$.

1538042,Existence of Closed Curves around Bounded Components,"I am stuck on part of a complex analysis proof that I think needs more justification than given.  It's pretty purely a topological statement, but it may be that complex-analytic techniques would be useful.  Basically, the statement boils down to this: Let $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ be open and connected, and let $K \subset \mathbb{C} \setminus U$ be a bounded component of the complement.  Then there exists a curve in $U$ bounding $K$. Is there any way to prove this statement without the Jordan-Schoenflies lemma, i.e. in a more elementary manner?  I have tried a lot of random stuff but nothing seems to work.  In particular, if there is a way to prove it with the argument principle that would be ideal, but not necessary. I appreciate any help at all. EDIT: So I really think this is a worthwhile question so I put the pitiful bounty I could afford haha. The things that need to be worried about are things like the complement of a Cantor set, and other lower-dimensional components of the complement. So we consider the set $U_1 = \lbrace z$ $|$ $\exists \text{ (simple) closed curve } \gamma \subset U \text{with } z \text{ in a bounded component of } \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma \rbrace$ Then $U_1$ is open, since we can write it as the union of the (open) interiors of bounded components of all curves in $U$, say $U_1 = \cup_{\gamma_{\alpha} \in \Gamma} (\cup_1^{n_{\alpha}} C_{\alpha, k})$ for $\Gamma$ the set of all closed curves in $U$. Now each $\bar{C_{\alpha, k}}$ intersects $\gamma_{\alpha} \subset U$ so that $\bar{C_{\alpha, k}} \cap U \neq \varnothing$, and writing $U_1$ as a union of all such sets, which each have (connected) $U$ in common, we get that $U_1$ is connected.  Since it's open and $\mathbb{C}$ is locally path-connected, $U_1$ is path-connected. Now, we can iterate this construction, then; if $\Gamma_k$ is the collection of all closed curves in $U_k$, write $U_{k+1} = \lbrace z$ $|$ $\exists \text{ (simple) closed curve } \gamma \in \Gamma_k \subset U_k \text{with } z \text{ in a bounded component of } \mathbb{C} \setminus \gamma \rbrace$ Then let $V = \cup U_k$.  Then any closed curve in $V$ is compact, and since each $U_k$ is open it is thus contained in finitely many such.  But this is a nested sequence, so it lies entirely within some $U_n$.  But all points in the bounded components of the curve are in $U_{n+1} \subset V$ so that the curve is homologous to zero in $V$. By a theorem, $V$ is thus simply connected.  So the crux is to show that, in fact, $V = U_1$. But that's where I get stuck.  We can also use the fact that a set is simply connected iff the complement in the sphere is the (connected) component of infinity.  To show that it contains this set is the difficult direction; that the complement of the infinity component contains $V$ is trivial. A proof should not use any theorem with the name ""Jordan"" in it, nor the word ""homotopy"".  These proofs are obvious.  I would say that from dimension theory, the Painleve Theorem is ok to use, but otherwise to avoid dimension.  I would also consider it a solution to show that the statement implies either the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem for dimension 2, or the Annulus Theorem for dimension 2.

Letting $y = \frac {(n + 1)x} {2} $ $$\frac {\sin y} {\sin \frac{x}{2}} \sin (y - \frac{x}{2}) + \sin2y = 
\frac {\sin (y + \frac {x} {2} )} {\sin \frac{x}{2}} \sin y $$ Then I used $\sin (\alpha + \beta)$ and $\sin (\alpha - \beta)$ formulas, bit they didn't help.","['calculus', 'induction']"
1538214,Probability that two such randomly generated strings are not identical,"A random bit string of length $n$ is constructed by tossing a fair coin $n$ times and setting a bit to $0$ or $1$ depending on outcomes head and tail, respectively. The probability that two such randomly generated strings are not identical is: $\frac{1}{2^n}$ $1 - \frac{1}{n}$ $\frac{1}{n!}$ $1 - \frac{1}{2^n}$ My attempt: So $2$ bit strings will be identical when same sequence of head and tail comes while generating the sequences. The probability that the two strings are identical is $(1/2) * (1/2) * ..... * (1/2) (n$ times $)$ which is $=\frac{1}{2^n}$ The probability for not identical is $=1-\frac{1}{2^n}$ Can you please explain in formal way?","['discrete-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
1538220,Cardinality of the Euclidean topology and the axiom of choice,"It is relatively straightforward to prove that the Euclidean topology has the same cardinality as the space itself.
I have sketched a proof below.
The proof seems to rely quite heavily on the axiom of choice.
I'm perfectly fine with (countable) dependent choice — I want to be able to define sequences recursively, for example — but one doesn't usually need more choice for topology in Euclidean spaces. Is dependent choice enough to show that the topology of $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq1$, has the same cardinality as $\mathbb R^n$? If yes, how to prove it?
If not, how much do we know about the cardinality of the topology?
It seems that the cardinality of the topology lies between $\mathfrak{c}$ and $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$, but are there tighter bounds? Proof of equal cardinalities with choice:
Let $T$ be the topology of $\mathbb R^n$ and $B$ a countable basis for it (rational balls, for example).
Since $|2^B|=|\mathbb R^n|$, it suffices to find an injection $f:\mathbb R^n\to T$ and a surjection $g:2^B\to T$.
These together will establish $|\mathbb R^n|\leq|T|\leq|2^B|=|\mathbb R^n|$ and the conclusion follows.
(Alternatively, the surjection $g$ has an injective right inverse, and we thus have injections both ways between $\mathbb R^n$ and $T$. The existence of a bijection follows from the Schröder–Bernstein theorem.)
We can simply take $f(x)=B(x,1)$ and $g(A)=\bigcup_{U\in A}U$. Injecting $\mathbb R^n$ to $T$ requires no choice and always $T\subset 2^{\mathbb R^n}$, so at least $\mathfrak{c}\leq|T|\leq2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ without AC.
Without choice, I can't compare cardinals so easily or produce injective right inverses for surjections, so my proof falls apart.","['axiom-of-choice', 'set-theory', 'general-topology', 'cardinals']"
1538283,Diagonalization of matrices of the form BAB,"If $A$ and $B$ are real symmetric matrices, the matrix $BAB$ is also a real symmetric matrix. My question is : knowing the orthogonal diagonalization of $A$ and $B$, can we obtain the orthonormal diagonalization of $BAB$ ? Starting from $A = UDU^{\top}$ and $B = VD'V^{\top}$ with $U,V$ real orthogonal matrices and $D,D'$ diagonal matrices, we get : $$ BAB = VD'V^{\top}UDU^{\top}VD'V^{\top} $$ which I do not find very helpful. My intuition is that the answer to the question is no. It is not even clear what the eigenvalues of $BAB$ would be in terms of $A$ and $B$. Can an additional hypothesis, such as ""$B$ is positive definite"" make the problem easier?","['linear-algebra', 'diagonalization', 'matrices']"
1538301,"Concept of ""eventually almost surely"" as an artefact of measure-theoretic axioms?","This is a serious question despite provocative title. Ever since I found out about Cox's theorem , I got quite enthusiastic about an alternative approach to formalising probability theory and started thinking about what are the consequences of our standard measure-theoretic school. This brings me to Borel–Cantelli lemma and its ability to show that a sequence of events will stop happening, almost surely, provided their probabilities are summable. Nice theoretic result, but practitioners of applied probability stress the importance of actually controlling the rate of convergence . In other words, the fact that an event will stop happening doesn't tell us how far down the sequence we have to go for the result to be true: $1, 5, \dots, $ Graham' number. So whilst I don't deny the validity of Borel-Cantelli, I merely want to know whether the emphasis on the significance of almost-sure convergence is misplaced and more mathematicians should strive to control the immediate rate of convergence rather than showing that the rate of converge is eventually dominated by a summable sequence. Answer 1: Can you not say the same thing about a convergence of any sequence? No, many proofs I've seen construct $N_{\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ in a proof of convergence, so the rate of convergence is not hard to extract. Also the concept of uniform convergence helps us to control the rate. Answer 2: Pure mathematicians shouldn't worry about immediate applications of their results, so your question is misdirected. Indeed, but what if there's a strong bias to care about a particular set of problems just as a consequence of axiomatising probability theory? Had we started with Cox's approach instead, would propositions like ""In this sequence of events, the events will stop happening, eventually"" be given as much attention? Answer 3: Dealing with infinities often lead to counter-intuitive results, which often, in retrospect, are shown to be useful much later. After many years since accepting measure-theory as underlying axioms, shouldn't we start looking at what kind of useful things came out of it and questioning whether our axioms were indeed conductive to useful research?","['probability-theory', 'borel-cantelli-lemmas', 'axioms', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"
