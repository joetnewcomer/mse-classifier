1485897,Example of non-surjective isometry of metric space,"I need an example of an isometry, $f$, from a metric space $X \rightarrow X$ that is not surjective.

1485924,Intuition behind the direct integral of a family of Hilbert spaces,"In order to understand better the mathematically rigorous version of Dirac's formalism in Quantum Mechanics I've been reading about direct integrals of Hilbert spaces, projector-valued measures and so on. Although the definition of the direct integrals of Hilbert spaces I've seem is quite clear, I simply couldn't get the idea behind it. The definition I have is the following: Definition 1 : Let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on the $\sigma$ -compact locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ . A measurable field of Hilbert spaces is a collection $\{H_x : x \in X\}$ of Hilbert spaces together with a linear subspace $\mathcal{S}$ of $\prod_{x\in X}H_x$ , whose elements are called measurable sections satisfying the following axioms: If $\eta\in \prod_{x\in X}H_x$ , then $\eta\in \mathcal{S}$ if and only if $x\mapsto \langle \xi(x),\eta(x)\rangle$ is measurable for all $\xi \in \mathcal{S}$ . There is a sequence $(\xi_n)$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that for almost every $x\in X$ , the closed linear span of $\xi_n(x)$ is $H_x$ . Definition 2 : Let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on the $\sigma$ -compact locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ , and $\{H_x: x\in X\}$ a measurable field of Hilbert spaces over $X$ . We define the direct integral of the $H_x$ to be the set of all $\xi \in \mathcal{S}$ (modulo agreeing on measure zero sets) such that $\int_X |\xi(x)|^2d\mu(x) < \infty$ and we denote this direct integral by $$\int_X^{\oplus}H_x d\mu(x).$$ On the direct integral we have the inner product $$\langle \xi,\eta\rangle = \int_X \langle \xi(x),\eta(x)\rangle_{H_x}d\mu(x),$$ which turns the direct integral into a Hilbert space. Now, although the definition by itself is clear, I can't get the intuition behind it. We have a collection of Hilbert spaces indexed by one topological space with a Radon measure. We then consider a linear subspace of the product, satisfing two properties. This is my first question: what is the intuition behind the defining properties of a measurable section? What we are really defining there? After that, one simply picks all the measurable sections with the property that the integral of the square of the norm of the vectors at each point converge. This is my second question: what is the intuition behind this definition? What we are really trying to define with this construction of the direct integral? The direct sum, for example, can be understood in a intuitive way as the space of sums of elements of each space alone. In the case of the direct integral I'm not seeing one simple inution like that.","['definition', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'intuition']"

1485991,Path From Positive Dedekind Cuts to Reals?,"Don't spend a lot of time on this. I'm certain I could bang it out myself; but maybe there's an answer out there that someone already knows. Say we use Dedekind cuts to construct the reals. Addition is fine and the proof that a set bounded above has a supremum is just lovely. Then we get to defining multiplication and all hell breaks loose - not that there's anything deep or really difficult about it, but at the very least the elegance is lost in a mass of special  cases. So I say to myself this is just because of the historical accident that people figured out how to extend the positive rationals to the rationals before considering completeness; why not  get completeness first? So the plan is to use Dedekind cuts of positive rationals to construct the positive reals, and then go from there to the reals. (In all of this ""positive"" may mean strictly positive or non-negative, whatever works.) This leads to at least one question : For what values of whatever and the construction can one prove the following theorem? Theorem If $F$ is an ordered field then the set of positive elements is a whatever . Conversely, given a whatever $P$, the construction gives an ordered field $F$ such that $P$ is (isomorphic to) the set of positive elements of $F$. Or if there is no such general theorem we could be more specific. Say $P$ is the set of positive reals. I can think of at least two constructions that do in fact lead from $P$ to $\Bbb R$; the question is what do I need to prove about $P$ in order to prove that the result is in fact $\Bbb R$. One construction would be to say that a real is just an element of $P$ with a plus or minus sign attached. This seems likely to lead to the sort of special-casing that we're trying to avoid (already when we think about $0$ we see we need to add a special clause to the effect that $+0=-0$; blech). Another construction is to regard $(a,b)\in P^2$ as representing the real $a-b$. So we'd define $(a,b)\sim(c,d)$ if $a+d=c+b$, we'd define the sum and product of elements of $P^2$ in the obvious way (in particular $(a,b)(c,d)=(ac+bd,ad+bc)$), show these operations lift to the quotient $P^2/\sim$ and be on our way. I kind of like the second construction. What do I need to prove about $P$ to show that $P^2/\sim$ is an ordered field with positive cone $P$?","['abstract-algebra', 'real-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
1485994,"the rationals as a metric space, closed and open sets","If we consider the rationals, $\mathbb{Q}$, as a metric space with the usual metric of the real line, then is the set $B=\{q\in\mathbb{Q} \mid {q^2}\lt 2\}$ a closed set? I know the definition of a closed set is a set that contains all its limit points. And I understand that here $\sqrt{2}$ is a limit point but it's not in our set but it's also not in the rationals so it's not in our metric space at all. Then, does $B$ contain all its limit points? Alternatively, we can say $B$ every point in $B$ is an interior point (has a neighbourhood contained in $B$) so that makes $B$ open. So then is $B$ both open and closed?

From this, I determined that the sequence $x_n$ monotonically decreases to zero as n approaches infinity. which satisfies my first test for series convergance, if $\sum_{n=2}^\infty x_n$ converges, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=0$. Next, I rearranged the equation in an attempt to perform a comparison test. I re-wrote the equation as $\sum_{n=2}^\infty (\frac1{n}-\frac1{n^2})$. This was to no avail as the only series I could think to compare it to was $\frac1n$ which is always greater than the original series and is divergant, which does not prove convergance to a limit. The ratio test concluded with $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}$ being equal to 1, which is also inconclusive (I can show my work if need be, but that would be a little tedious).

1486170,Let $G'$ be the commutator subgroup of a group $G$. Prove that $G'$ is the intersection of all the $K\mathrel{\unlhd}G$ for which $G/K$ is abelian.,"The Statement of the Problem: Let $G'$ be the commutator subgroup of a group $G$. Prove that $G'$ is the intersection of all the $K\mathrel{\unlhd}G$ for which $G/K$ is abelian. Where I Am: I feel like the wording here is kind of confusing me a bit. I assume that what I want to prove here is $G' = \cap K$, i.e. $G' \subset \cap K$ and $\cap K \subset G'$. But I didn't take the ""double-containment"" approach; rather, I just observed the following: \begin{align}
   (aK)(bK) & = (bK)(aK) & &\text{(because $G/K$ is abelian)} \\
   abK & = baK & & \text{(because $K$ is normal)} \\
   K & = b^{-1}a^{-1}baK & & \text{(multiplying both sides by $b^{-1}a^{-1}$)} \\
\

Clearly the RHS is in $K$, but the ""intersection"" thing is throwing me off. My choices of $a$ and $b$ were arbitrary, so certainly this proves that the RHS is also in the intersection of all normal $K$'s, right? Furthermore, since all of these statements are, as far as I can tell, ""iff,"" this means that I don't have to prove the other direction of containment, right?

1486188,I'm trying to calculate $e^{At}$. Where do I go wrong?,"Let $$A=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & -4 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ I want to determine $e^{At}$. I tried it using two methods. First via the Jordan form: The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is given by $$\det(I\xi-A)=\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & \xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=1\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}+\xi\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}$$ $$\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=1\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 \\ 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi^{2}+4\qquad\text{and}\qquad \begin{vmatrix}
\xi & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \xi & -1 \\ 0 & 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
\xi & -1 \\ 4 & \xi
\end{vmatrix}=\xi(\xi^{2}+4)$$ $$\implies\det(I\xi-A)=\xi^{2}+4+\xi(\xi^{3}+4\xi)=\xi^{4}+5\xi^{2}+4=(\xi^{2}+4)(\xi^{2}+1)$$ Then the eigenvalues are given by $\lambda_{1,2}=\pm i$ and $\lambda_{3,4}=\pm 2i$. Now, computing the corresponding eigenvectors: For $\lambda=i$, we have $$\begin{cases}
-ix+y=0 \\ -x-iy=0 \\ iz+w=0 \\ -4z-iw=0
\end{cases}\implies\begin{cases}
x=-y \\ 4z=-w
\end{cases}$$ Then setting $x=a$ and $z=b$, for $a,b\in\mathbb{C}$, we obtain: $$v_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}
a \\ -a \\ b \\ -4b
\end{pmatrix}=a\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+b\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -4
\end{pmatrix}$$ Similarly, for $\lambda=-i$, we compute, for complex $c,d$: $$v_{2}=c\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+d\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4
\end{pmatrix}$$ For $\lambda=2i$, we get: $$v_{3}=j\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+k\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -2
\end{pmatrix}$$ And finally, for $\lambda=-2i$: $$v_{4}=m\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}+n\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 2
\end{pmatrix}$$ Define $S=\begin{bmatrix}
v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{3} & v_{4}
\end{bmatrix}$. Then $$S=\begin{bmatrix}
a & -c & j & -m \\ -a & c & -j & m \\ b & -d & k & -n \\ -4b & 4d & -2k & 2n
\end{bmatrix}$$ But I have to calculate $S^{-1}$ via this method (which seems a bit too complicated), since $e^{At}=Se^{S^{-1}ASt}S^{-1}$. Then I tried to compute $e^{At}$ using the theory of autonomous behaviours: So I said that every strong solution of $\frac{d}{dt}x=Ax$ is of the form $$x(t)=B_{10}e^{-it}+B_{20}e^{it}+B_{30}e^{-2it}+B_{40}e^{2it}$$ The vectors $B_{ij}$ should satisfy the relations $$(-i\cdot I-A)B_{10}=0$$ $$(i\cdot I-A)B_{20}=0$$ $$(-2i\cdot I-A)B_{30}=0$$ $$(2i\cdot I-A)B_{40}=0$$ Solving these equations yield $B_{10}=v_{1}$, $B_{20}=v_{2}$, $B_{30}=v_{3}$, $B_{40}=v_{4}$, as calculated previously. Hence every solution of $x$ can be written as $$x(t)=a\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}e^{-it}+b\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4\end{bmatrix}e^{-it}+c\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{it}+d\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}e^{it} +j\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{-2it}+k\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}e^{-2it}+m\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}e^{2it}+n\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}e^{2it}$$ From this we can obtain four linearly independent solutions: $$x_{1}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}-e^{it} \\ e^{it} \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad x_{2}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}e^{2it} \\ -e^{2it} \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad x_{3}(t)=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ e^{it} \\ 4e^{it}\end{bmatrix} \qquad x_{4}(t)=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ e^{2it} \\ -2e^{2it}\end{bmatrix}$$ The matrix $X$ is defined as $X=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} & x_{2} & x_{3} & x_{4}\end{bmatrix}$ Then $e^{At}=\Phi(t):=X(t)X^{-1}(0)=\text{something really complicated, so I think I went wrong somewhere}$","['exponential-function', 'control-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'matrices']"
1486218,Evaluate the limit of $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{1/3}\sin(n!)}{1+n}$,"I cannot seem to wrap my head around this problem due to its complexity. The answer seems to be that the limit goes to zero for the following reasons: $\sin(x)$ will never be greater than $1$, and thus will only lessen the value of the numerator. If $\sin(x)$ is omitted from the equation, the equation reads $\frac{n^{1/3}}{1+n}$. Therefore, because the power of the denominator is greater than that of the numerator, the denominator will reach infinity faster than the numerator, causing the limit to converge to zero.

So, I have that, for $S_3$, the commutator of $a,b \in S_3$ is given by $$ [a,b] :=aba^{-1}b^{-1}. $$ And the commutator subgroup is the subgroup generated by all such $[a,b]$, i.e., $$ S_3 ' = <[a,b]:a,b, \in S_3> .$$ Ok, I have read about everything I can on this and watched every single YouTube video on the subject I can find, and have yet to see it just worked out explicitly in a way that makes sense to me. For example: these elements $a,b$. Do they need to be distinct from one another?! Is this an ordered pair, or not?! I know that I only need to check the normal subgroups, of which there are only three, but that's still a lot of things to check if they do not need to be distinct and need to be ordered.

1486475,Show that conjugate by $g$ is isomorphism,"This is a question from Dummit and Foote. 
I am still a novice at algebra so any feedback on my work would be appreciated! Let $G$ be a group and let $G$ act on itself by left conjugation, so each
        $g \in G$ maps $G$ to $G$ by \begin{align*}
		x\mapsto gxg^{-1}
\end{align*}
For fixed $g \in G$, prove that conjugation by $g$ is an isomorphism from
        $G$ onto itself (i.e. an automorphism of $G$). Deduce that $x$ and 
        $gxg^{-1}$ have that same order for all $x \in G$ and that for any subset
        $A$ of $G$, $\vert A \vert=\vert gAg^{-1}\vert$ (here $gAg^{-1}=
		\{gag^{-1}\vert a \in A\}$.) Take $g \in G$. We show that $\sigma_{g}:G \rightarrow G$ defined by $\sigma_{g}(x) = gxg^{-1}$
        is a homomorphism and is bijective. 
        First, we show that $\sigma_g$ is homomorphism. Take $x,y \in G$. 
        \begin{align*}
			\sigma_g(xy) &= g(xy)g^{-1} \\
				&= gxg^{-1}gyg^{-1} \\
				&= \sigma_g(x) \sigma_g(y)
		\end{align*}
        Hence, $\sigma_g$ is homomorphism.
        Second, we show that injectivity by showing $ker(\sigma_g) = \{1\}$. 
        Suppose, $gxg^{-1}=1$. Then, 
        \begin{align*}
			xg^{-1} &= g^{-1} \\
			x &= g^{-1}g = 1
		\end{align*}
        Hence, $ker(\sigma_g) = \{1\}$.
        Now, we show $\sigma_g$ is surjective. 
        Take $g \in G$. Then, for $x = g^{-1}yg \in G$ (since $G$ is a group, $x \in G$),
        $g(g^{-1}yg)g^{-1} = y$. 
        Therefore, $\sigma_g$ is bijective and it follows that it is a isomorphism.
        Since $\sigma_g$ is isomorphism, it follows that for every $x \in G$, $|x| = |\sigma_g(x)|=|gxg^{-1}|$.
        Furthermore, since $\sigma_g$ is bijective on $G$, $\sigma_g$ is bijective on $A \subset G$. 
        In particular, $\sigma_g$ is injective when restricted to $A$. 
        Hence, $|A|= |im(\sigma_{g|A})|=|gAg^{-1}|$.","['abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification']"

Let $\alpha$ be the real cube root of $2$, and consider $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. As well as $\alpha$, the subfield $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ must contain $\alpha^2$. We show that $$\alpha^2\neq j+k\alpha \text{ for } j,k \in \mathbb{Q}.$$ For a contradiction, suppose that $\alpha^2=j+k\alpha$. Then $$2=\alpha^3=\alpha(j+k\alpha)=j \alpha + k \alpha^2=j\alpha + k(j+k\alpha)=j\alpha+jk+k^2\alpha=jk+(j+k^2)\alpha.$$ Therefore $(j+k^2)\alpha=2-jk$. Since $\alpha$ is irrational, 
$j+k^2=0=2-jk.$ Note that $j+k^2=0 \iff -j=k^2$, so $$j+k^2=0=2-jk \iff k^3=2,$$ which is a contradiction because $k\in \mathbb{Q}$. \null
In fact, $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is precisely the set of all elements of $\mathbb{R}$ of the form $$p+q\alpha + r\alpha^2, \text{ where } p,q,r\in \mathbb{Q}.$$ To show this, we prove that the set of such elements is a subfield. We will show that every element of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ can be expressed in this way. Set 
$$X=\{p+q\alpha+r\alpha^2 | p,q,r \in \mathbb{Q} \}.$$ $X$ is a subgroup of the additive group $(\mathbb{Q}(\alpha), +)$. $1\in X$ is an identity element for multiplication. Multiplication between to elements: 
$$ (p+q\alpha+r\alpha^2)(p'+q'\alpha+r'\alpha^2) = p'p+(p'q+pq')\alpha+(p'r+pr'+qq')\alpha^2 +(r'q+rq')\alpha^3+rr'\alpha^4 $$ I know that I can't have $\alpha^4$, so I need to rewrite it.

1486878,Proving whether the following are groups or not.,"In each case, I am asked to decide whether the indicated pair is a group or not. If so, prove it; if not, show which group axiom fails. (a) $(\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}, +)$ where $\dfrac{1}{2} \mathbb{Z} = \{\dfrac{n}{2} | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. (b) $(\mathbb{R_{\geq 0}}, *)$ where $x * y = max\{x,y\}$. As for (a), it appears that $\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ is closed with respect to addition since given $x,y \in \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$, we have $x = \dfrac{n_1}{2}, y = \dfrac{n_2}{2}$, for some $n_1,n_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and so $x + y = \dfrac{n_1 + n_2}{2}$ and clearly $n_1 + n_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ so $x+y \in \dfrac{1}{2} \mathbb{Z}$. It's associative as well since $x,y,z \in \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ is such that $x = \dfrac{n_1}{2}, y = \dfrac{n_2}{2}, z = \dfrac{n_3}{2} = \dfrac{n_1 + n_2 + n_3}{2}$ in either case. There's an identity element since $0 \in \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ because $ 0 = \dfrac{0}{n}$. And there exists inverses since for any $x = \dfrac{n_0}{2} \in \dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ we have $x^{-1} = \dfrac{-n_0}{2}$ and $\dfrac{n_0 - n_0}{2} = 0 = e_{\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}}$. So $(\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group. (b) This is not a group since we do not have a $unique$ identity element since while $\forall x \in \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}}$ we have $x*x = x$, there is no unique $e$ such that $e*x = x$ that will not depend on $x$.

1486934,A Set of Trace Inequalities,"Let $\rho$ be a $N \times N$ positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix.  Let $S$ be a $N \times N$ matrix that squares to the identity.  Consider an arbitrary word constructed by multiplying $2n$ $\rho$'s together and an even number of $S$'s.   As I'm about to take the trace of the word, words are considered distinct only if they cannot be related by a cyclic permutation.  For example, when $n=4$, the distinct words would be $\rho^4$, $(\rho^2 S)^2$, $\rho S \rho^3 S$, and $(\rho S)^4$. I have reason to suspect that for fixed $n$, $\rho^{2n}$ is the word with the largest trace and $(\rho S)^{2n}$ is the word with the smallest trace.  Numerical experiments on random matrices along with multiplying out $2 \times 2$ matrices suggest that the trace decreases as the number of $S$'s increase.  Also, as we distribute the $S$'s more evenly among the $\rho$'s, the trace also appears to decrease. For certain words, relevant inequalities can be derived starting with the Lieb-Thirring inequality or the von Neumann inequality ( see this wikipedia page ).
For example, in the $2n=4$ case, let's define $\sigma = S \rho S$.  As $\sigma$ and $\rho$ are related by a similarity transformation, they have the same spectrum and in particular are both positive semi-definite.  Then by Lieb-Thirring, we have
$$
\mbox{tr} ((\rho S)^4 )= \mbox{tr}( (\rho \sigma)^2) \leq \mbox{tr} (\rho^2 \sigma^2) = \mbox{tr}((\rho^2 S)^2)

1486940,"Given an integer-valued polynomial, can its sequential values be used to determine whether it is reducible?","Let $p(x)$ be an integer-valued polynomial of degree $n$.  Is it possible to use up to $n$ consecutive values to potentially identify $p(x)$ as irreducible over the set of integer-valued polynomials? I managed to prove that for $n=2$ there is a definite upper limit for the 3rd sequential value, but it is very difficult for higher degrees, even with induction.  I encountered this question while considering some primes appearing in polynomial sequences.  I have attempted to use Lagrange interpolation and binomial forms and I haven't made any progress past $n=2$. Here is a sketch for the proof that there is an upper bound for the described polynomial with $n=2$: We have fixed positive integers $v_1,v_2, v_1\le v_2$ and polynomial in binomial form $$p(x) = a{x\choose 2}+(v_2-v_1)x+v_1$$ (Notice that we have set $p(0) = v_1,p(1) = v_2$.)  Since we have $n=2$, we must have $p(2) = v_3$ for whatever positive integer value $v_3$ takes on, which means that we have $p(2) = a + 2v_2-v_1 = v_3$, and so we have $a = v_3-2v_2+v_1$ (which is correct by Finite Difference theory), giving us $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1){x\choose 2}+(v_2-v_1)x+v_1$$ This shows that only the (binomial-form) quadratic term will change in coefficient as $v_3$ changes.  Now consider this value: $$p\left(\frac 12\right)=\frac 14v_1+v_2-\frac 14v_3$$ We again have linear change in the value at this point as $v_3$ changes, and it is clear that it is possible for this value to be negative. If $p(x)$ is composite with at least two non-constant integer-valued polynomial factors, and if $v_3$ is large enough to force $p\left(\frac 12\right)$ to be negative, then these factors are based exactly on the roots between $p(0)$ and $p(1)$, since each of these values is positive.  So we would have $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1)(x-q_0)(x-q_1)=a(x-q_0)\cdot b(x-q_1)$$ In order for these factors to be considered ""integer-valued"", both $a$ and $b$ must be large enough that either the denominator of the rational $aq_0\le 2$ or the denominator of the rational $bq_1\le 2$.  (For example, ${x\choose 2}={x(x-1)\over 2}$ and these factors are considered ""integer-valued"".)  But we also notice that $q_0$ must be between $0$ and the intersection $(Q_0,0)$ of the line $y=0$ with the line segment connecting $(0,p(0))$ with $\left(\frac 12,p\left(\frac 12\right)\right)$, and this distance $Q_0$ is inverse-linear with $v_3$ (by similar triangles).  But this means that $a$ must be asymptotically linear with $v_3$ and also (by the same argument for $Q_1$) that $b$ must be asymptotically linear with $v_3$, and therefore that $$p(x) = (v_3-2v_2+v_1)(x-q_0)(x-q_1)=cv_3^2(x-q_0)(x-q_1)\tag 1$$ But $v_3$ is allowed to take on any value, and equation $(1)$ implies that $c$ must vary inverse-linearly with $v_3$, therefore there exists $N\in\Bbb N$ such that for all $v_3\gt N$ at least one of $a(x-q_0),b(x-q_1)$ cannot be integer-valued. I'm fairly certain that this same argument applies in the same way for any given value of $n$.","['polynomials', 'number-theory', 'lagrange-interpolation', 'integer-valued-polynomials']"

B: H × H → \mathbb{R} \tag{i}
$$
  is a bilinear mapping, for which there exists constant $α, β > 0$ such that$$
|B[u, v]| \le α \| u \| \| v \|
$$
  and $$\beta\|u\|^2\leq B[u,u]\ \,(u\in H).\tag{ii}$$ Finally, let $f:H\to\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded linear functional on $H$. Then there exists a unique element $u\in H$ such that $$B[u,v]=\langle f,v\rangle\tag{1}$$ for all $v\in H$. Proof. For each fixed element $u\in H$, the mapping $v\mapsto B[u,v]$ is a bounded linear functional on $H$; whence the Riesz Representation Theorem (D.3) asserts the existence of a unique element $w\in H$ satisfying $$B[u,v]=(w,v)\ \, (v\in H).\tag{2}$$ Let us write $Au=w$ whenever $(2)$ holds; so that $$B[u,v]=(Au,v)\ \, (u,v\in H).\tag{3}$$ We first claim $A:H\to H$ is a bounded linear operator. Indeed if $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb{R}$ and $u_1,u_2\in H$, we see for each $v\in H$ that $$\begin{align}(A(\lambda_1u_1+\lambda_2u_2),v)&=B[\lambda_1u_1+\lambda_2u_2,v]\ \text{ by }(3)\\ &=\lambda_1B[u_1,v]+\lambda_2 B[u_2,v] \\ &=\lambda_1(Au_1,v)+\lambda_2(Au_2,v)\ \text{ by }(3)\text{ again} \\&=(\lambda_1 Au_1+\lambda_2 Au_2,v). \end{align}$$ This equality obtains for each $v\in H$, and so $A$ is linear. Furthermore $$\|Au\|^2=(Au,Au)=B[u,Au]\leq\alpha\|u\|\,\|Au\|.$$ Consequently $\|Au\|\leq\alpha\|u\|$ for all $u\in H$, and so $A$ is bounded. Next we assert $$\left\{\begin{array}{l}A\text{ is one-to-one, and}\\ R(A),\text{ the range of }A,\text{ is closed in }H. \end{array}\right.\tag{4}$$ To prove this, let us compare $$\beta\|u\|^2\leq B[u,u]=(Au,u)\leq\|Au\|\,\|u\|.$$ Hence $\beta\|u\|\leq\|Au\|$. This inequality easily implies $(4)$. We demonstrate now $$R(A)=H.\tag{5}$$ For if not, then since $R(A)$ is closed, there would exist a nonzero element $w\in H$ with $w\in R(A)^{\bot}$. But this fact in turn implies the contradiction $\beta\|w\|^2\leq B[w,w]=(Aw,w)=0$. Next, we observe once more from the Riesz Representation Theorem that $$\langle f,v\rangle =(w,v)\quad\text{for all }v\in H$$ for some element $w\in H$. We then utilize $(4)$ and $(5)$ to find $u\in H$ satisfying $Au=w$. Then $$B[u,v]=(Au,v)=(w,v)=\langle f,v\rangle\quad(v\in H),$$ and this is $(1)$. Finally, we show there is at most one element $u\in H$ verifying $(1)$. For if both $B[u,v]=\langle f,v\rangle$ and $B[\tilde{u},v]=\langle f,v\rangle$, then $B[u-\tilde{u},v]=0\ (v\in H)$. We set $v=u-\tilde{u}$ to find $\beta\|u-\tilde{u}\|^2\leq B[u-\tilde{u},u-\tilde{u}]=0.$ $\tag*{$\square$}$ If we already know that $\langle f,v \rangle = (w,v)$ = $B[u,v] = (Au, v)$ and we know that $A$ is one-to-one, isn't that already a proof that there can be only one $u$ for which 
$$ B(u,v) = (w,v) \tag{2}$$

1487159,"Some questions about the normal vector and Jacobian factor in surface integrals,","I have some short questions on some lingering confusing concepts, specific to surface integrals: a) Is the surface integral in the Divergence and Stokes's Theorem the same thing? Both require a unit-normal vector and a surface area component, $\vec n$dS, one is clearly a ""flux integral"", but is the one in Stoke's Theorem also a flux integral? b) In both theorems, the surface integrals require unit-normal vectors in the integrand.  But I remember working through some surface integrals where one shouldn't normalize the normal vector obtained -- I don't remember the example concretely now.  Why does this happen?  Why keep the magnitude of the normal vector... sometimes ?  I also have used a formula in the past, but not often: $\vec n$ = $<-f_x,-f_y,1$> - why doesn't this formula show up more often in surface integral problems?  Is this formula for a normal vector $\vec n$ = $<-f_x,-f_y,1$>...normalized / required to be normalized? c) And finally, why do some surface integrals have this factor in its $ds$ surface area component, $\large||\frac{d\vec v}{d\theta}\times\frac{d\vec v} {d\phi}||$,say, for integrating over a surface that is a sphere.  Does this factor just play the role of a ""Jacobian"", but for 3-D surfaces?  And then perhaps in flat surfaces in 3-D space, e.g., a plane disk in space, such a ""Jacobian"" factor is computed differently?  We know the Jacobian to be the determinant of the matrix of partial derivatives, e.g., yielding the variable ""r"" in polar and spherical coordinates integration.  But $\large||\frac{d\vec v}{d\theta}\times\frac{d\vec v} {d\phi}||$ is the magnitude of a determinant (cross-product of partial derivative vectors), though.

1487411,"Class field theory for $p$-groups. (IV.6, exercise 3 from Neukirch's ANT.)","I will use notation as in a preious question of mine. 
This question is from Neukirch's book ""Algebraic number theory,"" page 305, exercise 3. Notation for the problem Let $G$ be a profinite $p$-group (so all quotients by open subgroups are $p$-groups). We will denote the closed subgroups of $G$ by $G_K$ and call the indices $K$ for fields. We say that $K$ is the fixed field of $G_K.$ We write $K \subset L$ if $G_L \subset G_K$ and we call $K \subset L$ a field extension. We say that it is a finite extension if $G_L$ is of finite index in $G_K$ and we say that it is Galois if $G_L$ is normal in $G_K$ and then we write $G(L|K) = G_K / G_L.$ We call this the Galois group of $K \subset L.$ Further, let us say that we have a continuous multiplicative $G$-module $A.$ We mean with this a multiplicative abelian group $A$ on which $\sigma \in G$ act as automorphisms on the right and they act continuously. We let $A_K = \{a \in A | a^\sigma = a, \forall \sigma\in G_K\}.$Clearly we then have that $A_K \subset A_L$ for any field extension $K \subset L.$ If $$K \subset L$$ is finite, then we have a norm map
$$N_{L|K}:A_L \rightarrow A_K,$$ $$N_{L|K}(a) = \Pi_\sigma a^\sigma$$ where $\sigma$ varies over a system of representatives of $G_K / G_L.$ Now, suppose further that we have a surjective map $$d:G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p$$ where $p$ is a prime number. We also suppose we have a map $$v:A_k \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p$$ which we call a henselian $p$-valuation with respect to $d$ and assume that $v$ satisfies the following properties: $$v(A_k) = Z \supset \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$Z/nZ \cong \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$
for all $n$ that are a power of $p.$ $$v(N_{K|k}(A_K))=f_k Z$$ for all finite extensions $k \subset K$ where
$$f_K = (d(G):d(G_K)).$$ Suppose that $A$ satisfies the class field axiom, which means that for every cyclic extension $L|K$ $$ |H^i(G(L|K),A_L)| = \begin{cases} [L:K] & \text{for } i= 0 \\ 1 & \text{for } i=-1. \end{cases}$$
Here $$H^0(G(L|K),A_L) = A_K/N_{L|K}(A_L)$$ while $$H^{-1}(G(L|K),A_L) = \text{ ker } N_{L|K} / I_{G(L|K)}$$
where $\text{ker } N_{L|K}$ is the kernel of $N_{L|K} : A_L \rightarrow A_K$ and $I_{G(L|K)}$ is the ideal generated by elements of the form $a^{\sigma-1} = a^\sigma \cdot a^{-1}$ for $a \in A_L$ and $g \in G(L|K).$ The problem statement With notation now set up, the question is as follows. Suppose that we have a p-class field thoery $(d:G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p,v:A_k \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p)$ as above. Suppose we have another surjective homomorphism $d':G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p.$ Let $\text{ker } d' = G_{\hat{K'}}.$ We then have that $\hat{K'} |K$ is an extension with galois group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p.$ Let now $$v':A_k \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p$$ be the composite of $$A_k \xrightarrow{(,\hat{K'}|K)} G(\hat{K'} |K) \xrightarrow{d'} \mathbb{Z}_p$$ where $$(,\hat{K'}|K)$$ is the norm residue symbol derived from the $p$-class field theory. Neukirch now claims that: $(d',v')$ is also a p-class field theory. I thought I had a proof of this, but I a now very unsure, since he states that the theorem does not hold for $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ class field theories, i.e if we replace $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ above and $G$ is any profinite group, not neccesarily a $p$-group, the analogous statement does not hold. So my question is two-fold: How can I prove that $(d',v')$ is a p-class field theory? What goes wrong for $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}?$ What makes the case so different compared to $\mathbb{Z}_p?$","['class-field-theory', 'number-theory', 'local-field', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

I have a mathematical background and I know that the classical theorems of integral calculus (Stokes, Gauss, ...) are just particular versions of Stokes' theorem for manifolds and that the curl, divergence, ... operators are particular forms of the exterior derivative. But in this course of physics that I'm taking most of the student don't know a lot of mathematics and because of this, the teacher solves most of the problems without justifying that he can apply the desired results from calculus. For instance, in one exercise I have to prove that a magnetic monopole does not satisfy Maxwell's equations. To do this we'll prove that $\nabla \vec{B} \neq 0$ . The field created by a magnetic monopole is: $$\vec{B}_m = \frac{\mu_0 q_m}{4 \pi} \frac{\vec{r}}{\lvert\vec{r}\rvert^3} $$ And the solution given by my teacher is that the divergence of this field is: $$\nabla \vec{B_m} = \mu_0 q_m \delta^{(3)}(\vec{r})$$ Where the superscript is to show that it is a 3-dimensional delta. I don't know how to justify this rigorously because the field has a singularity at $\vec{r}=0$ and the $\delta$ is not a function but a distribution. Is there any way to generalize Stokes theorem to be able to show this? What is the formal way to prove this statement?

1487613,Ricci tensor from Riemann tensor,"I have been studying differential geometry and general relativity, and I have a question about the Ricci tensor.

This has a nice geometrical interpretation as a measure of the noncommutativity of successive parallel transport along directions $U$ and $V$, versus $V$ and $U$. Then, in some coordinate system one computes: $$R(\partial_{\alpha},\partial_{\beta})\partial_{\gamma} = \nabla_{\partial_{\alpha}}\nabla_{\partial_{\beta}}\partial_{\gamma} - \nabla_{\partial_{\beta}}\nabla_{\partial_{\alpha}}\partial_{\gamma} $$ where the commutator term disappears; this has a nice expression in terms of the Christoffel symbols, and then $ R^{\delta}_{\gamma \alpha \beta} = dx^{\delta} \left(R(\partial_{\alpha},\partial_{\beta})\partial_{\gamma}\right) $ is the Riemann tensor in component notation. Everything is wonderful and beautiful thus far. And so now, enter the Ricci tensor. I know it is defined as the contraction of the Riemann tensor: $$ R_{\mu \nu} = R^{\delta}_{\mu \delta \nu} $$ My questions are the following: 1) What is the geometrical motivation behind this particular contraction of the Riemann tensor? (we are contracting in the index corresponding to the first ""test direction"" used in the Riemann curvature operator, is there a purpose for this choice?) 2) What is the geometrical interpretation of the Ricci tensor? Is there a coordinate-free way of defining it as a curvature operator, like the Riemann tensor? 3) Why contract the second covariant index and not another one?
