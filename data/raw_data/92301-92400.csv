1254338,Derivative for numerical models.,"I am working in Mechanical engineering and Computer vision, in which I use a matlab code (or codes) to represent  a specific system or process. Of course such model has an input , an implimented  structure , and an output. In the way of studying the sensitivity analysis of such models, I think of using local sensitivity analysis tests, in which the partial derivative of the models is computed to represent the index of sensitivity of each parameter or variable. My question here is that, If my model cannot be represented by a function to evluate partial derivatives  explicitly, is it possible to use directly the numerical methods to derive the partial derivatives? For example, we may run the model for some values $x_1, x_2, ...,x_j,..., x_n$ to give  $y_j$, then for the values  $  x_1, x_2, ...,x_j+\Delta_j,... , x_n$ to give  $y_{j+\Delta}$, and then estimate the partial derivative wrt the variable $x_j$ by  $\frac{y_{j+\Delta}-y_j}{\Delta}$.
I think this way is straightforward, but how to be assure that our model has a differentiable form i.e. is differentiable? Or let me say, can we speak about difference in variation without including the notion of partial derivatives and differentiability of the model? I respect any perspective and I highly appriciate your opinions. Thanks .","['differential-forms', 'partial-derivative', 'numerical-methods', 'derivatives']"

1254373,What is a local invariant?,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Then, it is usually said that $M$ has local invariants associated to $g$. For example, the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection associated to $g$. My question is: in which sense these curvature-related objects are local invariants? In addition, it is usually said that a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ has no local invariants associated to the symplectic form $\omega$. I guess this is related to the Darboux theorem, which implies that locally every symplectic form is the standard symplectic form, but, what is the precise form of this statement?

1254506,Problem in deducing the number of onto functions,"Let $A, B$ have $m, n$ elements ($m > n$). Therefore, the number of onto functions from $A$ to $B$ is: $$\sum_{k = 0}^n (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} (n - k)^m.$$ How can one use the IE (Inclusion/Exclusion) theorem to prove this? Actually, I was following the deduction here . First, the number of functions from $A$ to $B$ is $n^m$. Then, to find the number of onto functions, we have to subtract from it the number of functions whose ranges are not the complete $B$. First, the number of functions having one element less in their range from $B$ is $n(n  - 1)^m$. By subtracting it, however, as said there, ""unfortunately we subtract twice the number of functions whose ranges are two elements less than $B$.
This is what I want to know how by subtracting , we are losing twice the number of functions whose ranges are two elements less than $B$.","['algebra-precalculus', 'combinatorics']"

1254553,How is the concept of the limit the foundation of calculus?,"My casual study of mathematics and calculus introduced me to the notion that calculus didn't find a firm foundation until Cauchy, Weierstrauss (et al) developed set theory some ~100 years after Newton and Leibniz. The concept of limits (and their epsilon-delta proofs) was what allowed calculus to get past the shaky logic of infinitesimals. (The above is just me laying out what I believe to be true, but please feel free to take issue with any/all of it.) HERE IS MY ACTUAL QUESTION (more or less). How exactly do limits save calculus? When thinking about the derivative, we want to contemplate the rate of change of a function wrt its input. Instead of using an infinitesimal change in the input, we take the limit as the change in the input goes to zero. When we say ""take the limit"" we mean finding a band around the function value (+/- ""epsilon"") and derive a band around the input value (+/- ""delta"") such that any value of the input beyond a certain point is guaranteed to generate a function value within our desired band (i.e., +/- epsilon). This is all rather loose, but hopefully you catch the drift. BUT HOW DOES THIS HELP SAVE CALCULUS? Is it because by saying we can take any ARBITRARY epsilon, we are in effect , saying we can take EVERY epsilon > 0? We exhaust every epsilon all the way down to (but not including) 0. This action reminds me a lot of the idea that 0.999... = 1. Sorry if this isn't clear, but if I had to put this in simplest terms, I guess it boils down to: is ""arbitrarily many"" the same as ""infinitely many""?","['infinitesimals', 'big-picture', 'calculus', 'limits']"

I know how to do this in $\mathbb{N}$, but I'm stuck trying to do this is $\mathbb{Z}$. The idea I have is to define lowest common multiple ($lcm$) and using property of coprimes to define $x^2$. From there $(x+y)^2$ will allow me to define $x\cdot y$. So I first define $$z = lcm(x,y) \iff  x\mid z \land y \mid z \land \forall m(x \mid m \land y\mid m \rightarrow z \mid m).$$ Then I define $$2x^2 = x(x+1) + x(x-1) = lcm(x,x+1) + lcm(x,x-1).$$ However, I realised that my definition of $lcm(x,y)=z$ could give $z$ as either a negative or positive integer. Without the ordering relation ($<$), I am having difficulty finding a way to define $lcm$ such that I only get the positive $z$. How can I overcome this?","['arithmetic', 'logic', 'number-theory']"

1254658,Did I correctly derive the scheme for this PDE using the Crank Nicolson Method?,"I'm taking an Applied Numerical Methods course this semester, and I was given the following homework problem: Basically, before I begin writing any sort of code, I would like to ensure that I have set everything up correctly. I took the starting PDE and used the Crank-Nicolson method to bring it down to the following: $$
\frac{u_m^{n+1}-u_m^n}{k} = 0.4\frac{u_{m+1}^{n+1}-2u_{m}^{n+1}+u_{m-1}^{n+1} + u_{m+1}^{n}-2u_{m}^{n}+u_{m-1}^{n}}{2h^2} - 0.2\frac{u_{m+1}^{n+1}-u_{m-1}^{n+1}-u_{m+1}^{n}+u_{m-1}^{n}}{4h} + \frac{u_m^{n+1}+u_m^{n}}{2}
$$ To get this, I took the starting equation (first one on the list in the problem) and shifted focus up by 1/2k (or n + 1/2).  Then, from this point, for the u_t side I took the centered difference and for the other side of the equation I took the averages [(u_m^n+1 + u_m_n) /2].  Then, each of the components on the right hand side had two numerator components.  I took a centered difference of the appropriate derivative of each of these components, recombined the fractions, and obtained my result above.  This is basically me describing the Crank Nicolson method.  I very well may have done something wrong here, so if something seems off please let me know! Finally, I plugged in h=k=0.001 and separated the n's from the n+1's, and I got $$
-200.05u_{m-1}^{n+1}+400.9995u_{m}^{n+1}-199.95u_{m+1}^{n+1} = 199.95u_{m-1}^{n}-398.9995u_{m}^{n}+200.05u_{m+1}^{n}

1254765,What Rubik's Twist configuration has the lowest visible surface area?,"The Rubik's Twist has been a fun time sink. From the wiki page, [It] is a toy with twenty-four wedges that are right isosceles triangular prisms. The wedges are connected by spring bolts, so that they can be twisted, but not separated. By being twisted, the Rubik's Snake can be made to resemble a wide variety of objects, animals, or geometric shapes. Its ""ball"" shape in its packaging is a non-uniform concave rhombicuboctahedron. This page has an applet to show configurations in 3D and play around with it, which will give you an idea of what the puzzle is like (requires Wolfram CDF player plugin.) Edit: another page that has a simulator working as of July 2023. A friend asked what shape would minimize surface area and we thought the standard 'ball' shape would be the solution: We denoted the square side of the wedge as $1u^2$ and thus the long rectangular side of the wedge is $\sqrt{2}u^2$ and a triangle is $\frac{1}{2}u^2$ . In the ball configuration, we counted 12 rectangle panels showing (blue, orange, and red in the above image) 6 ""squares"" (12 triangles) and 8 niches each made of 3 triangles giving: 12 + 24 = 36 triangles ( $18u^2$ ) 12 rectangle panels ( $12\sqrt{2}u^2$ ) $18u^2 + 12\sqrt{2}u^2$ surface area, which is just under $35u^2$ . However, we found that there are configurations with smaller surface areas like: We calculated the surface area as just under $32u^2$ (12 rectangular panels, 2 squares and 26 triangles.) The definition of surface we are using is any visible face - the area which would have to be painted if someone were to hold it and look all around it, no area would appear unpainted. (See the comments for extra clarification.) In the ball shape (see first image) there is a 1x1x1 void in the center which is not counted as surface area as it is not visible. I'm not sure if that makes the problem much more difficult, however, I'd be interested to know of a solution in either case. I calculate the surface area by counting up the number of visible rectangular panels, ( $\sqrt{2}u^2$ ) triangles ( $\frac{1}{2}u^2$ ) and the two square ends of the snake ( $1u^2$ each.) By adding these units up I get the surface area. So, for the ball we are excluding the $6u^2$ on the inside. Additionally, partial turns that expose the ""inside"" of the snake are not allowed (see below) as these are not valid configurations. (Partial turn exposing inside grey face) The ball shape had a lot of outcroppings which add up. We thought that another way of minimizing surface area is by maximizing touching faces. What configuration has the lowest visible surface area, and can it be derived or proved mathematically? Or, can the configuration above be proven to exhibit the lowest surface area? Or, can a computer program be written to iterate over (or in some way consider) all combinations (of which there can be no more than $4^{23}$ simply by observing each of the 23 twists can exist in 4 positions, although some positions are physically impossible as it overlaps itself) and find the solution?","['combinations', 'geometry', 'puzzle', 'surfaces']"
1254777,Spherical coordinates for sphere with centre $\neq 0$,"For something like $(x-1)^2+y^2+z^2=1$, we would let $x-1=\rho \sin (\phi)\cos (\theta)$ $y=\rho \sin (\phi)\sin (\theta)$ $z=\rho \cos (\phi)$ But we know $\rho =1$ right? So it becomes $x-1= \sin (\phi)\cos (\theta)$ $y= \sin (\phi)\sin (\theta)$ $z= \cos (\phi)$ If the sphere was centred on the origin, then the limits would be $\phi \in [0, \pi]$ and $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ but since its not, I am guessing it isn't this. I need to know how to find the limits when it is not in the centre. I know that the $\phi$ is the angle from the positive $z$ axis downwards but it is strange because if the sphere is in the origin, and if the limit is from $0$ to $\pi$, it doesn't cover all of it, it covers half. Is it always meant to cover half?

1254787,Composition of function with linear functional is Lipschitz implies function itself is Lipschitz,"This is taken from Conway's A course in functional Analysis (p. 98, Exercise 9): If $(S,d)$ is a metric space and $X$ is a normed space, show that if $f:S\rightarrow X$ is a function such that for all $L\in X^*$ (the continuous dual of $X$) $L\circ f:S\rightarrow\mathbb C$ is Lipschitz, then so is $f$. I tried deriving the claim using the Uniform Boundedness Principle but it seems the wrong tool, for to apply it I somehow need to be looking at a Banach space and bounded operators from it. The natural choice seems to consider $X^*$ and $A_s\in\mathcal B(X^*,\mathbb C)$ given by $A_s(L)=L(f(s))$ for any $s\in S$, but both the fact that the Lipschitz constants can depend on $L$ and no obvious way of relating a bound on $||A_s||$ to $|f|$ make me a little bit puzzled.

1254808,Riesz's 1909 proof of the Riesz Representation Theorem,"Frigyes Riesz originally proved the Riesz Representation Theorem on $ C[0,1] $ -- here is his 1909 paper in English ( original French ). He builds a real valued function $ \text{A} $ on $ [0,1] $ satisfying $$ {{\LARGE{\sum_i}} {{\left|\text{A}(x_i)-2\text{A}\left({{x_i+x_{i+1}}\over 2}\right)+\text{A}(x_{i+1})\right|} \over {x_{i+1}-x_i}}} \leq {M_{\mathcal{A}} \over 2} $$ for any partition $ \{0=x_0, x_1, x_2, \cdots x_{n-1} = 1\} $ and a fixed constant $ M_{\mathcal{A}} $, then says, ""It follows that the derived numbers of the function $ \text{A}(x) $ exist and that these derivatives are functions of bounded variation."" My problem: By ""derived numbers"" he means the Dini derivative (upper right, say). Granted the expression in the sum is close to a difference quotient, I'm still not seeing why the upper right Dini derivative exists and is of bounded variation. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Update: Riesz's 1909 paper cited above announced the Riesz Representation Theorem in a brief note. He gave more details in a followup paper in 1911 . There he rewites the sum above as: $${{\LARGE{\sum_{\large{k=1}}^{\large{m-1}}}} \left|{{\text{A}(x_{k+1}) - \text{A}(x_k)} \over {x_{k+1}-x_k}} - {{\text{A}(x_k) - \text{A}(x_{k-1})} \over {x_k-x_{k-1}}} \right|} \leq G,$$ where $x_k$ is the midpoint. Putting $D_k = \large{{\text{A}(x_k)-\text{A}(x_{k-1})} \over {x_k-x_{k-1}}}$, this reads: $$\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} |D_{k+1} - D_k| \leq G,$$ which makes it clear that the difference quotients are of bounded variation, hence bounded, so $\text{A}$ has finite upper Dini derivatives.

1254936,Equivalence of category of subsets and subobjects,"I'm trying to show that the categories $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and $Sub(X)$ are equivalent. According to Steve Awodey's ""Category Theory"" I need to find two functors $ E: \mathcal{P}(X) \to Sub(X)$ $F: Sub(X) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$ and a pair of natural isomorphisms $\alpha: 1_{\mathcal{P}(X)} \overset{\sim}{\to} F \circ E$ $\beta: 1_{Sub(X)}: \overset{\sim}{\to} E \circ F$ I believe I've constructed E and F correctly on the objects. On object $Y \in \mathcal{P}(X)$ I define $E(Y) = \lambda y. y$, and since $Y$ is a subset of $X$ this has the type $Y \to X$ as required. On object $f \in Sub(X)$ I define $E(f) = \lbrace f(x) \mid x \in \mathsf{dom}(f) \rbrace \subseteq X$ as required. I'm not sure how I define the functors on morphisms in both cases though. Edit: I forgot to define $Sub(X)$, so here's a definition: The objects in $Sub(X)$ are monomorphisms $m$ with $cod(m) = X$ and the given two objects $m$ and $m'$ an arrow in $Sub(X)$ is $f: m \to m'$ such that $m = m' \circ f$.

I'd appreciate if anyone could please provide either the detail or the sketch to prove it. Let $c=\exp_p(tV)$ be a geodesic on a Riemannian manifold $M$. Let $W(t)$ be a parallel vector field $c$ with $W(0)=W$. Consider the Jacobi field $J(t)=(D\exp_p)_{tV}  ( {tW}  )$. Then: $\lim_{t\to 0}|\frac{W(t)-\frac{J(t)}{t}}{t}|=0.$ For constant curvature spaceforms, when I take normal Jacobi fields the formula holds good. But I'm not sure how to prove it for general manifolds. P.S. in the paper that I mentioned, the formula is mentioned somewhat heuristically, but this is my interpretation of their words. EDIT I: I can also see that if we take compare the norms of $W(t)=W$ and norms of $J(t)$, which is $|J(t)|=t|W|+O(t^3)$ (See Do Carmo, P. 115), then clearly, $lim_{t\to 0}\frac{|W(t|)-\frac{|J(t)|}{|t|}}{|t|}=0.$ But still it doesn't prove the result, but shows that the claim could be correct. EDIT II:I think I've got an idea, it's working so far, but not fully yet. I considered the function $f(t):=\langle tW(t)-J(t),tW(t)-J(t)\rangle =||tW(t)-J(t)||^2$ and showed so far that $f(0)=f'(0)=f''(0)=0$.

Probability he ends up with \$0?,"I'm working on the extra credit for my Discrete Structures homework, but so far I have been unable to get a handle on the problem, even with help from 3rd parties, so I've decided to turn to you guys. The title explains the essentials, but I've included the full wording below, along with some notes. Extra Credit Problem: Consider a game of gambling, where Bob started with 20 dollars in his pocket. Each time Bob wins, he will earn 1 dollar and each time he loses he will lose 1 dollar. A fair coin is flipped to decide win or loss, head = win & tails = loss. Bob will stop playing if his balance reaches 100 dollars or 0 dollars. What is the probability that Bob is ruined? (He loses all his money, as opposed to returning home with $100 in his pocket.) The question is as such: Let $P_k$ be the probability that Bob is ruined when he has k dollars in his pocket. a. Write a recurrence relation for $P_k$ b. Solve the recurrence relation to find the answer. Note that $P_0 = 100\%$ (with no money Bob is ruined) and $P_{100} = 0\%$ (Because Bob returns with 100 dollars in his pocket and the game is over for Bob, so he is not ruined.) Basically, I'm at a loss for how to create this recurrence relation. I started by investigating what information I might be able to derive from the given values of P, but honestly I'm not sure if this is really helpful. Solving the relations does not seem to be as difficult, but creating them has proved extremely challenging for me, if anyone has advice on a good way to think about this or some sort of methodology that helps you personally it would be well received. Any help you could provide is much appreciated, I'd really like to get this extra credit or at least be able to understand how it works, because the professor generally doesn't go over the HW unless explicitly asked about a problem and even then it's very quickly, so that we have time in lecture to cover the new/current material.

1255031,Projection Mappings are Quotient Mappings?,"The book I am using for my Introduction of Topology course is Principles of Topology by Fred H. Croom. Prove that if $X=X_1\times X_2$ is a product space, then the first coordinate projection is a quotient map. Definition : Let $X$ and $Y$ be two topological spaces and $f:X→Y$ a surjective map. The map $f$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $f^{−1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Equivalently, a subset $U$ of $Y$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if $f^{−1}(U)$ is closed in $X$. I was able to prove the projection mapping $\pi_1:X\rightarrow X_1$ was onto and continuous. I am having a bit of a pickle showing is $U \subset X_1$, $\pi_1^{−1}(U)$ open in $X \Rightarrow U$ open in $X_1$. I do have  an idea to it. Let $U_1\subset X_1$. Since $\pi_1$ is surjective, then $\pi_1(\pi_1^{-1}(U_1))=U_1, \forall U_1 \in X_1$. Consider the collection $\mathscr{B}_{X_1\times X_2}$ of all subsets of the form $O_1\times O_2$ where $O_1$ and $O_2$ are open in $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectfully. Thus $\mathscr{B}_{X_1\times X_2}$ is a basis. Let $W=\pi_1^{-1}(U_1)$ be an open subset of $X$ containing the point $x$. Then there is a $B=O_1\times O_2\in\mathscr{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq W$. Then $\pi_1(B)=O_1\subset X_1$. Since $O_1$ is an element of $\mathscr{B}_{X_1}$, the basis of the factor space $X_1$, then $O_1$ is open. Taking a union of a family of $O_{1,i}$ such that it equals $\pi_1(W)=U_1$, then U_1 is open set. Thus projection mapping to the first coordinate is a quotient map. Any suggestions?

1255437,Galois Extension whose Galois Group is $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$,"The book I am using for my Abstract Algebra course is Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Joseph A. Gallian. Let $E/F$ be a Galois extension with Galois group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$. Determine the subfield lattice for $E/F$. I was wondering if someone could guide me into the right direction on how to solve this problem. From what I do understand, Gal$(E/F)\cong \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$. Galois Theory, in a nutshell, is used to find how many subfields are between $E$ and $F$. If $E/F$ is ""nice"" then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subfields and the set of subgroups. I was able to find subgroups of the direct product $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$. I don't know if I have found all subgroups to be honest with you. I did them by hand and wasn't sure if there was a theorem to verify if I got the right number of subgroups. The list is as follows. $S_0=\{(0,0)\}$, the trivial subgroup. $S_1=\{(0,0),(0,2)\}$ $S_2=\{(0,0),(1,2)\}$ $S_3=\{(0,0),(1,0)\}$ $S_4=\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3)\}$ $S_5=\{(0,0),(1,1),(0,2),(1,3)\}$ $S_6=\{(0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2)\}$ $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4=\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)\}$ From the information I got, we can see that $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$ has 3 subgroups of order 4 and 3 groups of order 2. Hence we have 6 subfields between $E$ and $F$. This result in the following lattice. Am I on the right track? Would the approach be similar if the Galois group was isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_3\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$? Would there be a faster way to find the subgroups of direct products?

1255613,Probability of a double-headed coin,"Here are three related problems from Blitzstein and Hwang's Introduction to Probability . Curious if my approach is sound. I'm reasonably confident in the first result, but not so much in the other two, particularly the last one. 1:: A hat contains 100 coins, of which 99 are fair but one is double-headed. A coin is chosen uniformly at random. The chosen coin is flipped 7 times, and it lands heads on all 7. What is the probability that the chosen coin is double-headed? My answer With all of these, I'm using naive probability, in which the numerator is my desired outcome(s) and the denominator my possible outcomes given the result. In this case, my desired outcome is double-headed, and my possible outcomes are double-headed or not double-headed and seven straight heads. This gives me $$\frac{\frac{1}{100}*1}{\frac{1}{100}*1 + \frac{99}{100}*\frac{1}{128}} \approx .5639$$ 2:: A hat contains 100 coins, of which at least 99 are fair, but there may be one that is double-headed. (If there are no such coins, all 100 are fair.) There is a 1/2 chance that one of the coins is double-headed. A coin is chosen uniformly at random, is flipped 7 times, and lands heads each time. (a) What is the probability that one of the coins is double-headed? My answer My desired outcomes are there is a double-headed coin and this coin is double-headed or there is a double-headed coin and this coin is not double-headed and this coin comes up heads seven times. My possible outcomes are the two above, and also there is no double-headed coin and this coin has come up heads seven times. This gives me: $$\frac{\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{100}*1 + \frac{1}{2}*\frac{99}{100}*\frac{1}{128}}{\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{100}*1 + \frac{1}{2}*\frac{99}{100}*\frac{1}{128} + \frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{128}} \approx .6942$$ (b) What is the probability that the chosen coin is double-headed? Similar to the above, but now $$\frac{\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{100}*1}{\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{100}*1 + \frac{1}{2}*\frac{99}{100}*\frac{1}{128} + \frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{128}} \approx .3914$$ Addendum: I'm a dolt - there was no reason for me to be less confident in the last answer than in the second one. (I should be equally (un)confident in both.) If the probability of selecting the double-headed coin, when present, is ≈.5639, Answer(2b) is just ≈.5639 * Answer(2a).",['probability']

1255637,Joint pdf of N > 1 i.i.d. random variables isotropic if and only if they are centered gaussian?,"Are centered Gaussian densities given by
  $$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/(2 \sigma^2)}$$
  the unique densities such that the joint pdf of $N > 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables
  with density $f_X$ is isotropic, that is, rotation invariant? Thus, one asks that, for some valid function $h$, $$\prod_{i=1}^Nf_{X}(x_i) = h(R),\qquad R = \sqrt{x_1^2+...+x_N^2}$$
This question came up in a discussion and I found it very interesting. I have attempted to solve it as follows. Note first that $f_X$ must be symmetric, otherwise a rotation mapping $x_i$ to $-x_i$ would violate the symmetry.
Therefore, without loss of generality, we may assume that 
$$f_X(x) = c e^{-g(x^2)}$$
for some function $g$ such that $g(0)=0$ and some normalizing constant $c$. Then we need the joint pdf to satisfy 
$$f_X(x_1)\cdots f_X(x_N) = C e^{-h(R^2)}$$
for some function $h$ and some constant $C$, such that, still without loss of generality, $h(0)=0$. From this we get
$$\sum_{i=1}^N{g(x_i^2)}=h\left(\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i^2}\right)$$
Considering $x_i=0$ for $i \neq 1$, one gets
$$g(x_1^2) + (N-1) g(0) = h(x_1^2)$$
$$\therefore g(x) = h(x), \forall x > 0$$
Considering instead $x_i=0$ for $i \notin \{1,2\}$ and assuming $N > 1$, one gets
$$g(x_1^2)+g(x_2^2) = h(x_1^2+x_2^2)$$
$$g(x)+g(y) = g(x+y), \forall x,y > 0$$
$$\therefore g(x) = \lambda x, \forall x > 0$$
Thus, substituting $g$ back into $f_X$ implies that the distribution is centered Gaussian:
$$f_X(x) = c e^{-\lambda x^2}$$
Now, the observation that centered Gaussian distributions are indeed isotropic completes the proof. Is the proof sound? I'm looking forward to correcting any mistakes it may have.

$$ is an integer. The integral can be written as $\frac{1}{2i\pi}\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\frac{\lambda'(t)}{\lambda(t)-a}dt$, the proof is more real analysis than complex analysis. I am not asking on the proof, witch is pretty easy to learn. The fact that the index is an integer surprise me a lot, is there any intuition to get the idea ? Or perhaps, any combinatorics explanation ?","['complex-analysis', 'intuition']"
1255896,Commuting of Hom and Tensor Product functors?,"Let $V_i,W_i$ be finite dimensional vector spaces, for $i=1,2$.
Assume we have homomorphisms $\phi_i:V_i\rightarrow W_i$. Then, there is an induced map $\widehat{\phi_1 \times \phi_2} \in Hom(V_1 \otimes V_2,W_1 \otimes W_2)$ such that  $\widehat{\phi_1 \times \phi_2}(v_1 \otimes v_2) = \phi_1(v_1)\otimes\phi_2(v_2)$. We can look at this construction as a map $\psi: Hom(V_1,W_1)\times Hom(V_2,W_2)\rightarrow Hom(V_1 \otimes V_2,W_1 \otimes W_2)$, where $\psi:(\phi_1,\phi_2)\rightarrow \widehat{\phi_1 \times \phi_2}$. It is easy to see that $\psi$ is a bilinear map.
It follows (from the universal property) that we have an induced homomorphism: $\hat \psi:Hom(V_1,W_1)\otimes Hom(V_2,W_2)\rightarrow Hom(V_1 \otimes V_2,W_1 \otimes W_2)$ such that:
$\hat\psi(\phi_1\otimes\phi_2)=\widehat{\phi_1 \times \phi_2}$. My question: is $\hat\psi$ necessarily an isomorphism? 
Note that there is equality of dimensions (since both Hom,Tensor multiply them), hence clearly some isomorphism must exists between
$Hom(V_1,W_1)\otimes Hom(V_2,W_2)\cong Hom(V_1 \otimes V_2,W_1 \otimes W_2)$. If $\hat\psi$ is not isomorphism, is there some other ""canonical"" isomorphism? I will just note that in the case of finite dimensional vector spaces, there is equality of dimensions, hence clearly some isomorphism must exists.","['abstract-algebra', 'tensor-products', 'category-theory', 'commutative-algebra']"

The first way (my way) would be to multiply the original cost by $.20$ to get $20$%, then simply add that number to original cost. The second way is to take the original cost and divide it by $.80$ and the number you get ends up being the cost. But this second way is more than the first. The second way almost adds an extra $5$%. Why are these different, and which is the proper way to mark up by a percentage?","['finance', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Here is my work so far let $\arctan x =a\implies x=\tan a$ let $\arctan y =b\implies y=\tan b$ therefore $\frac{x+y}{1-xy}=\frac{\tan a+\tan b}{1-\tan a\tan b}=\tan(a+b)$ $\implies a+b=\arctan \frac{\tan a+\tan b}{1-\tan a\tan b} $ $\implies \arctan x+\arctan y = \arctan\frac{x+y}{1-xy}$ I know $\pi$ is the period of $\tan x$ so $xy\gt 1$ constraint must have something to do with this. But I am not able to figure out how exactly these period and $xy\gt 1$ are related. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"
1255970,What is the integral of $e^{a \cdot x+b \cdot y}$ evaluated over the Koch Curve,"What is 
$$\int_{K} e^{a \cdot x+ b \cdot y} \mu(x,y)$$
where $K$ is the Koch curve and $\mu(x,y)$ is a uniform measure look here . Attempt: I can evaluate the integral numerically and I have derived a method to integrate $e^x$ over some cantor sets, look here . When I tried using that method to integrate the Koch Curve, I end up unable to express the integral in direct terms of its self. Here's a proof that integration can be done over the Koch Curve... Information: I'd like a symbolic answer if its available, but infinite series/products for this integral are great too. If there's a reference that actually handles this specific function over fractals and derives a symbolic result, that's good to. Also feel free to change $K$ to any other (non-trivial of course ;) ) variant of the Koch curve if that makes it easier to compute. I warn only that because the goal is to integrate over any fractal rather than just one or two special examples, you shouldn't pick needlessly trivial examples... Motivation: The derivation of this result allows for integration over a fractal, however the actual reason this is useful, is because of the usefulness of the exponential function. For instance, the concept of average temperature over a fractal is a very interesting concept. $e^x$ type functions allow for rudimentary temperature fields to be constructed and theoretically integrated over fractals. $e^x$ type functions are useful for many kinds of problems, but they seem to be difficult to integrate over fractals. In addition, developing a theory for integrals over fractals, requires a large library of results, and $e^x$ should definitely be included in that list of integrable functions.","['recurrence-relations', 'fractal-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"
1256011,Does a logical matrix representing sets have a name or special properties?,"Imagine a collection of separate objects and several sets. These sets can be represented using a logical matrix . $M = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ Each line corresponds to a set, and each column corresponds to an object. So $M_{i,j} = 1$ if $Set_i$ contains $Object_j$, else $0$. I wondered if this kind of matrix, used to represent sets, had a special name?
And if, in addition, there was some interesting properties? For example, to represent a graph, one can use an adjacency matrix, which is a logical matrix too. By raising it to the n-th power, each $x_{i,j}$ obtained indicates the number of existing n-length paths from i to j. I am in search of similar property (which may be about subset or superset for example), or a name to this matrix that would allow me to further my research.","['boolean-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1256024,What's so special about radians? (Differentiation) [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why do we require radians in calculus? (11 answers) Closed 9 years ago . It seems to me that radians have lots of very special properties that allow us to do maths with trigonometric functions. When I first came across radians, I was led to believe that they were designed purely to make finding areas and arc lengths of sectors more easy. But then I discovered that: $$\frac{d}{dx}\sin x=\cos x$$
Clearly this only works when using radians. If you used degrees and found the gradient of $\sin x$ at $x=0$ you would get  that gradient $=\frac{\pi}{180}^{\circ}$. So my question is: why does differentiating $\sin x$ give you $cosx$ when you are using radians ? What makes radians so special in this respect?","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

I proved that $p|a$, but I cant prove $p^2|a$, and my idea is as follow: By multiplying $(p-1)!$, we get: $(p-1)!+\frac{(p-1)!}{2}+...+\frac{(p-1)!}{p-2}+\frac{(p-1)!}{p-1}=\frac{a(p-1)!}{b}$ $\,\,\,\,$ $(1)$ So, the number $\frac{a(p-1)!}{b}$ should be integer. consider the left hand of the sum of $(1)$ in the ring $Z_p$.

So: $(p-1)!+\frac{(p-1)!}{2}+...+\frac{(p-1)!}{p-2}+\frac{(p-1)!}{p-1}\equiv 1+2+...+p-1\equiv \frac{p(p-1)}{2}\equiv 0$$\,\,\pmod p$. And from here, $p|\frac{a(p-1)!}{b}$, and that's mean: $p|a$.

1256075,Understanding proof of fundamental theorem of algebra,"So this is the proof I have: If $p(z)$ is a non-constant polynomial, then there exists a $z \in \Bbb Z$ such that $p(z) = 0$ .

Then there exists an $N > 0$ such that $\lvert f(z) \rvert \leq 1$ for all $\lvert z \rvert > N$ . I don't understand how this bolded line is achieved or how it follows from the limit. Continuing the proof: Take the closed disk $\lvert z \rvert \leq N$ . Since this disk is compact and $f$ is continuous, there exists an $M > 0$ such that $\lvert f(z) \rvert \leq M$ for all $\lvert z \rvert \leq N$ . I don't understand what the disk has to do with anything, or how these inequalities follow from that disk, or why we are re-using the letter $N$ again. Finishing the proof: Since $f(x)$ is bounded and entire, by Liouville $f(x)$ is a constant so $p(z)$ is a constant which is a contradiction. I understand this ending but I don't understand the two previous lines.","['proof-verification', 'complex-analysis', 'epsilon-delta']"
