280555,Convergence of a positive series with an application to sums of Poisson random variables,"Main question : Let $a_n \geq 0$ and $b_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \uparrow \infty$. Is it true that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{b_n^2} < \infty \,?
$$ I strongly suspect there is either a short, slick proof that I am not seeing or a simple counterexample I've missed. Some motivation . Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ be independent Poisson random variables where $X_n$ has mean $a_n$ and $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$. If $\sum_n a_n = \infty$ then it's trivial to verify that $S_n/b_n \to 1$ in $L_2$ and so, also, in probability. I am quite sure that this result should also hold almost surely. ($S_n$ is Poisson with a diverging mean.) One way to go about that would be to use Kolmogorov's convergence criterion in concert with Kronecker's lemma so that if
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \text{var}(S_n/b_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{b_n^2} < \infty
$$
then almost-sure convergence would follow. Trivial bounds don't work, but there is some hope . Clearly $a_n / b_n \leq 1$ uniformly in $n$, but this crude bounding is not enough to assert the desired result. For example, taking $a_n = 1$ shows that $\sum_n a_n/b_n^2 < \infty$, but, of course, $\sum_n b_n^{-1} = \infty$. So, we need something stronger than this. On the other hand, let $a_n = (n \log n)^{-1}$, which is just on the boundary of divergence, i.e., $\sum_n a_n = \infty$ as needed, but if we replaced the exponent with $-(1+\delta)$ for any $\delta > 0$, then it would converge. Yet, in the $a_n = (n\log n)^{-1}$ case we have
$$
b_n \approx \int_e^n \frac{\mathrm d x}{x \log x} = \log \log n
$$
so that 
$$
\sum_n \frac{a_n}{b_n^2} \leq C \sum_n \frac{1}{n \log n (\log \log n)^2} < \infty \,.
$$ This same basic argument works if we introduce more iterated log terms in the definition of $a_n$. Furthermore, it's clear that if $\sum_n a_n < \infty$, then $\sum_n a_n/b_n^2 < \infty$. And, that brings me back to the main question.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

280585,Intuition behind convex functions,"For me, possibly the most out-of-nowhere definition of the first semester of Calculus was the following definition of a convex function and its equivalents. Function $f$ is convex on the interval $J$ if for $\forall x,y\in J$ and $\forall\lambda\in (0,1)$ is $$f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda )y)\leq\lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda )f(y)\tag1$$ Equivalently if $\forall u,v,w\in J:u<v<w$ $$f(v)(w-u)\leq f(w)(v-u)+f(u)(w-v)\tag2$$ or $$\frac{f(v)-f(u)}{v-u}\leq \frac{f(w)-f(v)}{w-v}\tag3$$ I'm looking for an intuition, or visual representation of what these three definitions ""actually"" mean. (3) , being very similar to the definition of a derivative, is the only one that makes sense to me, that is: a function is convex if the slope between points $(u,f(u))$ and $(v,f(v))$ is lesser than the slope between $(v,f(v))$ and $(w,f(w))$ . (2) seems to look at areas of rectangles, however, that is about everything I could say about it. (1) Got it! $f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda )y)$ is the functional value of a point between $x$ and $y$ and $\lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda )f(y)$ is a point between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ on a slope between the two points, thus represented by the fact that the slope is never below the functional value. I can now see that it represents the fact that the slope between $x$ and $y$ is always above the function, I don't see, however, how $\lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda )f(y)$ is a point on the slope.

280613,Bound on the growth of a singular measure,"Working through some measure theory, I came upon the Lebesgue-like decomposition for monotonic functions. In that context, I've cooked up a singular measure $\nu$ on $[0,1]$ about which I know only that it is regular Borel, continuous, and satisfies $\nu K = 0$ for some $K \subset [0,1]$ of full Lebesgue measure. I would like to conclude that $K$ contains a subset $K'$ of full Lebesgue measure for which each element $x$ satisfies
$$
\nu\bigl((x-1/n,x+1/n)\bigr) = \mathcal O(1/n)~~.
$$
This would be sufficient to demonstrate that the function mapping $x \mapsto \nu\bigl([0,x]\bigr)$ is singular, in the sense of having an a.e. defined and vanishing derivative (of course, it is continuous as well by continuity of $\nu$). I'd appreciate any comments on how to show the above bound, and whether that's a good strategy for approaching the problem of defining a singular function from a singular measure. My other thought was that perhaps there is a standard way to 'remove' density from the complement of $K$ (using continuity) sufficiently to form an open set containing $K$ with zero $\nu$-measure, from which the result follows (and the singular set looks much more like the complement of a Cantor set).","['measure-theory', 'singular-measures']"

My explanation of this is: We look at the element $k$ from $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. $k$ can be hit either by $1$ element from $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, or by $2$ or more. In the first case, we remove that $k$ and that element from $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, and we're left with $n-1$ elements in the domain, and $k-1$ elements in the range. It also has to be a surjection, so we can pick them in $\mathrm{Sur}(n-1,k-1)$ ways. In the second case, we remove that element from the domain, and we're left with $n-1$ elements in domain, and $k$ elements in the range. So we can pick the number of surjections in $\mathrm{Sur}(n-1,k)$ ways. But, why is that factor $k$ there in both cases?","['discrete-mathematics', 'recursion']"

280719,Asymptotic behaviour of a function whose derivatives vanish asymptotically,"Let $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be a $C^\infty$ function such that $\lim_{t\to\pm\infty}f^{(k)}(t)$ exists for all $k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. A neat little trick (apparently due to Thomas Hill ) shows that $\lim_{t\to\pm\infty}f^{(k)}=0$ for $k\geq 1$. Indeed by l'Hopital's rule $$\lim_{t\to\pm\infty}f(t) = \lim_{t\to\pm\infty}\frac{e^t f(t)}{e^t} = \lim_{t\to\pm\infty}\frac{e^t(f(t)+f'(t))}{e^t}=\lim_{t\to\pm\infty}(f(t)+f'(t)),$$
so the claim follows inductively. Is it possible to draw conclusions about the asymptotic decay of $f'$? For example, is there a $\delta > 0$ such that $\lim_{t\to\pm\infty}f'(t)\cdot e^{\delta |t|}=0$? Are there examples when this is not the case?","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

280789,Circle on sphere,"Foreword This question was inspired by initial mistakes in this question . I wanted to explore the strange circle with $A>\pi r^2$ and got lost into geometrical jungle. A spherical cap is usually described by it's height $h$, radius of the base $a$ and radius of the sphere $r$. Besides we have a relation $a^2+(r-h)^2=r^2$ so the cap actually only has two degrees of freedom. When considering a case of circle on a sphere (like the Earth), it's the surface of a spherical cap, but we can't see the height or other classic parameters of this spherical cap. Instead we encounter parameters like area $A$, perimeter $C$ and diameter $d$. I will try to write formulae for these:
$$A=2\pi rh$$
$$C=2\pi a$$
$$d=2r\theta$$ Where $\theta$ is introduced with $\sin\theta=\frac{a}{r}$ or $\cos\theta=(1-\frac{h}{r})$. As the cap only has two degrees of freedom, it should be a good problem with unique solution if only two values are known. A-C Problem The simple example: $A$ and $C$ are given. I show this only as example before the other tasks. We can easily find $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$ and then solve: $$A=2\pi rh = 2\pi r (r-\sqrt{r^2-a^2})$$ to obtain $$r=\frac{A}{2\sqrt{\pi(A-\pi a^2)}}$$ Parameters $a$ and $r$ are now known and it is straightforward to find $h$, $d$, $\theta$ and anything else. C-d Problem $C$ and $d$ are given. First step once again is easy: $a=\frac{C}{2\pi}$. The knowing of $a$ suggests that we might prefer the $\theta$ definition with the sine. We obtain:
$$d=2r\theta=2r\arcsin\frac{a}{r}$$ That's where I got stuck. Is there an easy way to solve this? Is there a hard way to solve this? I tried solving numerically with Wolfram Mathematica and it went into complex numbers. When solving the geometrically equivalent $\sin\frac{d}{2r}=\frac{a}{r}$ I got some roots, but the search seemed very unstable and not finding the root closest to initial value. Besides it was finding a lot of different roots while I am pretty sure that there should only be one $r$ for each pair of $d$ and $a$. What would be the right formulation to solve this problem numerically? A-d problem $A$ and $d$ are given. This seems the hardest one. We obtain a system of equations: $$A=2\pi r h$$
$$d=2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{h}{r}\right)$$ (The first equation suggested solving the problem in $h$ and $r$). Is this system solvable analytically? Or numerically? My experiments with Wolfram Mathematica never converged. Of course, I could express $h$ or $r$ from the first equation and leave only the second in one of these forms:
$$d = 2r\arccos\left(1-\frac{A}{2\pi r^2}\right)$$
$$d = \frac{A}{\pi h}\arccos\left(1-\frac{2\pi h^2}{A}\right)$$ But I have no idea how to solve these either.","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'spherical-geometry']"
280793,A Friend of a Friend: Transitivity in Large Random Graphs,"Suppose we have a network $G$ of $n$ people, who share $M$ connections. Define the transitivity index $\tau(G)$ as the count of all possible threesomes having $3$ connections divided by the count of all possible threesomes having $2$ or $3$ connections (provided that these counts are not both zero, otherwise $\tau(G)=1$). Suppose that the connections are distributed uniformly randomly (conditional on there being $M$ such connections). More precisely: Let $N\equiv\binom{n}{2}$ and let the model $\mathcal G(n,M)$ consist of all $\binom{N}{M}$ graphs, having vertices $\{1,2,\ldots,\
n\}$ and $M$ edges, in which every such graph is realised with probability $\binom{N}{M}^{-1}$. Define the transitivity distribution implicitly by $G\sim\mathcal G(n,M)\Rightarrow\tau(G)\sim\mathrm{TR}(n,M)$. In $\mathcal G(n,M)$, what can be said about the transitivity distribution $\mathrm{TR}(n,M)$ for large $n$ and $M$? Edit I am particularly interested in quantiles of $\mathrm{TR}(n,M)$. For example, for $(n,M)=(100,150)$, the order statistic $\tau_{4750:5000}$ was about $0.054$ in simulation. Enumeration is not an option.

Note The fabulously useful answer provided by joriki may not work for $M<{{n}\over{2}}$, since the denominator then has mass at $0$, which is contra the assumption in Approximations for Mean and Variance of a Ratio .

Suppose to the contrary that $S$ has a limit point $x_0$. Then by definition given any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $x \in S$ with $x \neq x_0$ such that $\vert x - x_0 \vert < \varepsilon$. Choose $\varepsilon$ to be the smallest distance between any two $a_i, a_j \in S$ with $i \neq j$.

281007,Working out minimum sample size,"I have just started a course in statistics and have some general questions that have arisen trying to solve the following question: A survey organisation wants to take a simple random sample in order to estimate the percentage of people who have seen a certain programme. The sample is to be as small as possible. The estimate is specified to be within 1 percentage point of the true value; $\textit{i.e.}$, the width of the interval centered on the sample proportion who watched the programme should be 1%. The population from which the sample is to be taken is very large. Past experience suggests the population percentage to be in the range 20% to 40%. What size sample should be taken? I think I have to use this and solve for n $$1.96\sqrt{\frac{\pi (1-\pi)}{n}} = .01$$ where $\pi$ is the sample estimated proportion of people who watch the programme. Now does this mean that I am 95% sure that I am within 1% accuracy? 
I also am not aware as to how I can find $\pi$ though I have read I could use the population standard deviation instead and suspect I would have to use that as I am given some information- that the pop proportion is 20%-40%. Finally in general what is being said here: $$\pi \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\pi (1-\pi)}{n}} = .01$$ My notes at the moment just say it contains the population mean 95% of the time.... why?

281082,Where does the iteration of the exponential map switch from one fixpoint to the 3-periodic fixpoint cycle?,"In the answering of another question in MSE I've dealt with the iteration of $x=b^x$ where the base $b=i$. If I reversed that iteration $x=log(x)/log(i)$ then I run into a cycle of 3 periodic fixpoints. Another complex base on the unit circle however, $b = \sqrt{0.5}(1+i)$ gives only one fixpoint. I asked myself, whether there is a point on the complex unit circle between that values, where the ""switching"" occurs, but could not recognize a meaningful interpretation. By binary search I narrowed the range to the following boundaries. Let $\varphi_1=0.345008597051431179704966664178 $ and $b_1=\exp(\pi i \varphi_1) $ and Let $\varphi_2= 0.345008597051431179704966665794$ and $b_2=\exp(\pi i \varphi_2) $ such that the bases $b_1,b_2$ lay on the complex unit circle. Then consider the iteration to the fixpoint beginning at some arbitrary $x_0$ in the near of the guessed fixpoint, say $ x_0=1+I$, and iterate $ x_k= \log(x_{k-1})/\log(b_1) $. We shall approximate one fixpoint. Now we use the other base $b_2$, begin again at $ x_0=1+I$, and iterate $ x_k= \log(x_{k-1})/\log(b_2) $. We get a 3-periodic cycle of fixpoints, one of them very near at $ t_\infty \sim - \pi/2 + \delta i $ where $ \delta$ goes to zero if we let go $\varphi_2 $into the direction of $ \varphi_1$. Q1: What is the exact/symbolic value of $\varphi_x$ where the splitting from one into three fixpoints occurs? Wolfram-alpha and Ries at Robert Munafo's site were not helpful so far...

281185,Intuition behind topological spaces,"I'm studying topology since a few months ago and I have never caught a good intuition of the topological spaces, but now I think that I did. My intuition is the next; as many people point out the open sets capture a notion of nearness,
(but I did never understand the exact way of this nearness intuition),the points in the open sets are near, and two points in distinct open sets are far, and then the axioms try to capture the behaviours of the opens. To find a good intuition I have worked with two examples of spaces which I named $A$ and $B$ ; $A=[\{a,b,c,d,e,f\},(\{a,b,c,d,e,f\},\{\},\{a,b,c,e,f\},\{e,f\},\{a,b\},\{a,b,d,e,f\},\{a,b,e,f\})]$ , $B=[\{a,b,c,d,e,f\},(\{a,b,c,d,e,f\},\{\},\{a,b,c,e,f\},\{a,b,d,e,f\},\{a,b,e,f\})]$ and I obtained the next pictures (and here is my first question: are these  the correct spatial representaition of the spaces? $A$ is in the right, $B$ is the left, the black circles represent points): And then the union axiom allows to establish different degrees of nearness, specifically the opens that aren't union of other opens  have near points, and the unions have points nearer than other points that aren't. Concretely in the space $A$ ; $\{e,f\}$ and $\{a,b\}$ are nearer than $c$ and $d$ , then the unions allow to speak of a ""global "" nearness. The intersection axiom also talk about  different degrees of nearness, in the way that if we have near points and we have other near points that have common points, then than points are near, and in fact they are nearer, and so the intersection  talk of a ""local"" nearness. And finally the axiom of the necessary membership of the space itself and the empty set, guarantees the fact that ""there are nothing outside the space"" or the totality of the space and in that sense all the points are near in the space. Is this a good intuition? if not, please give me a good one.","['general-topology', 'intuition']"

holds for $Re s>1$. In some books, the author states that by 
$$\log\zeta(s)=-\sum_p\log\left(1-\frac{1}{p^s}\right)$$ Is that correct? Sometimes, I think complex logarithm is really ""annoying"", because I always have to worry about the determination of it. Do I have to worry about that? Thank you very much!",['complex-analysis']

281280,${\mathbb Q}$ as a direct product.,"Motivation + Problem: While doing some exercises in Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0, I came across a problem which asks the reader to prove that ${\mathbb Q}$ is not the product of two nontrivial groups.  This is the standard product in the category of groups. My Question: Since the chapter delves into categorical arguments, I tried it this way.  We suppose not, that ${\mathbb Q} \cong G\times H$ and note that for any group $Z$ and any appropriate mappings $f,g$, we have the following diagram (sorry for the awkward TeXing, xypic doesn't seem to work here...), $\displaystyle \begin{array}{ccccc} & & Z & & \\ & ^{f}\swarrow & \downarrow&_{\exists!\langle f,g\rangle} \searrow^{g} & \\  & G\longleftarrow_{\pi_{1}} & {\mathbb Q} & _{\pi_{2}}\longrightarrow H &\end{array}$ So, we find that there is always a unique mapping in the center if this is a product.  The projections either inject an isomorphic copy of ${\mathbb Q}$ or are the zero mapping.  We'd like to show that either $G$ or $H$ is trivial. I'm not sure how to show that at least one must be trivial. My Attempt: Suppose $G \neq \{0\}$.  We need to show $H = \{0\}$.  Letting $Z = G$ and let $f = id$, we find that $G \cong {\mathbb Q}$.  Moreover, the unique map in the center must be some multiplication mapping (which takes $x\mapsto qx$ for rational $q$; this is because $\pi_{1}$ must be a multiplication mapping if it is not the zero mapping).  My guess here is that if $H$ is not trivial, it must also be an isomorphic copy of ${\mathbb Q}$ and we can allow $g$ to be some multiplication map like above such that the unique center mapping does not allow the right-hand triangle to commute.

A locally compact Hausdorff topological space $X$ without isolated points has at least cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$. To prove it, one can find two closed sets $P_0$ and $P_1$ without isolated point and such that $P_0 \cap P_1= \emptyset$; then one find $P_{00} \subset P_0$ and $P_{01} \subset P_{0}$ (resp. $P_{10} \subset P_1$ and $P_{11} \subset P_1$) with the same properties, and so on.

281393,Normalisation of an algebraic curve.,"I need to compute explicitly the normalisation of a singular algebraic curve $C$ which is given by an explicit equation in $\mathbb{A}^2$. This task is mostly reduced to finding the integral closure $\tilde{A}$ of the regular function ring $A := \mathcal{O}_C(C)$ in the function field $k(C)$, and then taking the normalisation $\tilde{C}$ to be the variety whose ring of regular functions is $\tilde{A}$. One aspect of the problem that bothers me slightly is the case when $A$ has zero divisors and computations in the field of fractions become substantially less intuitive. For instance, if $C$ is given by $x^2 = y^2$, then it is intuitively quite clear that the normalisation is a disjoint union of two lines, but deriving this via explicit construction feels somewhat slippery at a number of points. Thus, I would like to ask the following: It feels natural that $\pi : \tilde{C} \to C$ should be the normalisation as soon as the following hold: $\tilde{C}$ is a normal variety, $\pi$ is a morphism. $\pi$ is an isomorphism away from the singular points. Does this criterion hold, or am I missing something here? If it does hold, then a practical way to find the normalisation could be to make an informed guess about what it should be, and then the verification is almost immediate. (The ""official"" definition of normalisation requires that $\pi$ should be a finite morphism and it should induce the isomorphism of function fields $ k(C) \to k(\tilde{C})$. ) What are the technical difficulties and traps in using the ""standard"" procedure of finding the normalisation in the case when $C$ is the zero locus of a reducible polynomial (if any)? Is it generally true that if $C$ is a sum of irreducible curves $C_i$, whose normalisations are $\tilde{C}_i$, then $\tilde{C}$ is a disjoint sum of $\tilde{C_i}$?

281597,An example of a non Noetherian UFD,"An example of a non Noetherian UFD. I know an example is $$K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,\dots]$$ with $K$ a field, but I don't know why. Can someone give another example or better an explanation? Is it not Noetherian because it's not finitely generated? And why do you know it is a UFD?? My question now is how to prove this is a UFD.","['unique-factorization-domains', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
281601,Why is the derivative of $\frac{|x|}{x}$ equal to $\emptyset$ at $x=0$?,"I got a bit of a confusion here. If $\varphi(x)=\frac{|x|}{x}$, then 
$$
\varphi(x) = \left.\Bigg\{
\begin{array}{cc}
1 &if \ x>0\\
\emptyset & if \ x=0\\
-1 & if \ x <0
\end{array} \right.
$$
and then $$
\varphi'(x) = \left.\Bigg\{
\begin{array}{cc}
0 &if \ x>0 \cup x<0\\
\emptyset & if \ x=0
\end{array} \right.
$$ The derivative at $0$ is nevertheless also $0$. Why? My only suspicion is that $\varphi(x)$ is actually somehow defined at $x=0$, although I do not see how: there should be an indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$. Some form of L'Hospital's rule?","['absolute-value', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

281645,What is the intuition behind the Borel Cantelli Lemma? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Understanding probabilistic Borel-Cantelli Lemma ""Corollary"" in Royden and Fitzpatrick (1 answer) Closed 3 years ago . The Borel Cantelli Lemma states that the probability of a set of outcomes happening infinitely many times in an infinite sequence is $0$ under some conditions. I neither understand the math (behind the proof) nor the intuition behind what is being said.  Can someone motivate the use of this theorem?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory', 'borel-cantelli-lemmas']"
281647,What is $\lim\limits_{z \to \pi/2} \tan^2(z) $ for $z \in \mathbb C$?,"I am trying to evaluate the following limit ($z \in \mathbb C$): $$\lim\limits_{z \to \pi/2} \tan^2(z) $$ I get the following solution: $$\lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \tan^2(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \frac{1 - \cos^2(x)}{1-\sin^2(x)} = \infty$$ whereas: $$\lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \tan^2(ix) = \lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \frac{\sin^2(ix)}{\cos^2(ix)} = \lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \frac{(\frac{1}{2i}(e^{-x} + e^{x}))^2}{(\frac{1}{2}(e^{-x} - e^{x}))^2} = \lim\limits_{x \to \pi/2} \frac{-(e^{-x} + e^{x})^2}{(e^{-x} - e^{x})^2} < \infty$$ Thus, I conclude the limit is undefined. Is that correct?","['complex-analysis', 'limits']"
