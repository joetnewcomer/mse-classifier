2071,Explanation of numeric experiment that approximates e?,"Recently I found this post on Reddit. It describes the following algorithm to find e: Here is an example of e turning up
  unexpectedly. Select a random number
  between 0 and 1. Now select another
  and add it to the first. Keep doing
  this, piling on random numbers. How
  many random numbers, on average, do
  you need to make the total greater
  than 1? The answer is e. This means that you need on average ~2.7 random real numbers to make the sum greater than 1. However, a random number between 0 and 1 would on average be equal to 0.5. So intuitively I would think that, on average, only 2 random numbers would be required to have a sum > 1. So where did I go wrong in my thinking? Update I just figured it out myself: You need at least two numbers to have a sum > 1, but often you'll need three, sometimes you'll need four, sometimes five, etc... So it only natural that the average required numbers is above 2. Thanks for the replies!","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

2125,Primes dividing the values of integer polynomials,"Problem : Let $n$ be an integer and $p$ a prime dividing $5(n^2-n+\frac{3}{2})^2-\frac{1}{4}$. Prove that $p \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$. The polynomial can be re-written as $(\sqrt{5}(n^2-n+\frac{3}{2})-\frac{1}{2})(\sqrt{5}(n^2-n+\frac{3}{2})+\frac{1}{2})$. If this vanishes mod $p$ then $5$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$, which shows that $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{5}$ (the primes 2 and 5 are easily ruled out). It feels like the problem should be solvable by understanding the splitting of primes in the splitting field of this polynomial, but I can't find an appropriate ""reciprocity law"". The things I'm not sure about are: How does one rule out the primes congruent to $-1$ mod $5$? Under what circumstances is it the case that the set {rational primes that split in the ring of integers of some number field} is the union of arithmetic progressions?

2159,A curious compactness confusion: space filling curves in the hilbert cube that contradict a bona fide theorem?,"Now, I may have only slept two hours last night and would currently struggle to discern a 'proof' by induction of FLT from a piece of genuine mathematics, but that doesn't stop mathematics from bugging me. At present I am puzzled by something I saw on MO this morning ... The linked question concerns the Hilbert cube $[0,1]^\mathbb{N}$ (an infinite product of intervals) and the existence of space filling curves thereof- that is: continuous images of the unit circle that are surjections on the Hilbert cube. The accepted answer , together with another answer (which actually constructs such a map) and various comments, seems to allude toward an answer in the affirmative. However, the linked theorem (the 'Hahnâ€“Mazurkiewicz theorem') which states: A nonempty Hausdorff topological space is a continuous image of the unit interval if and only if it is a compact, connected, locally connected second-countable space. seems in direct contradiction to this since (and I may be mistaken for reasons explained above): The Hilbert cube is a subset of a normed space and hence a metric space The sequence $(1,0,0...), (0,1,0...), (0,0,1,...)$ has no convergent subsequence So the Hilbert cube is not sequentially compact, therefore non-compact (the two are equivalent in metric spaces). Which seems at odds with the only if portion of the theorem's statement. Maybe this is wikipedia taking me for a ride. Maybe I am just hallucinating a portion of this argument. Either way, this is annoying me. Thanks in advance for clearing this up...",['general-topology']

2189,What are some real-world uses of Octonions?,"... octonions are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic: they are nonassociative. Comes from a a quote by John Baez. Clearly, the sucessor to quaterions from the Cayley-Dickson process is a numerical beast, but has anybody found any real-world uses for them? For example, quaterions have a nice connection to computer graphics through the connection to SO(4), and that alone makes them worth studying. What can be done with a nonassociative algebra like the octonions?

2194,Why is the Hilbert Cube homogeneous?,"The Hilbert Cube $H$ is defined to be $[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$, i.e., a countable product of unit intervals, topologized with the product topology. Now, I've read that the Hilbert Cube is homogeneous.  That is, given two points $p, q\in H$, there is a homeomorphism $f:H\rightarrow H$ with $f(p)=q$. What's confusing to me is that it seems like there seems to be a stratification of points.  That is, there are Points contained in $(0,1)^{\mathbb{N}}$ Points which have precisely $n$ coordinate a $0$ or $1$ for n a fixed natural number. Point which have countably many coordinates equaling $0$ or $1$ and countably many not and Points which have n many coordinates NOT equal to $0$ or $1$. Now, for fixed $p$ and $q$ both in class $1$ or $3$ (or fix an n and use class $2$ or $4$), it's clear to me that there is a homeomorphism taking $p$ to $q$, simply by swapping around factors and using the fact that $(0,1)$ is clearly homogeneous. But what are the homeomorphisms which mix the classes?  In particular, what homemorphism takes $(0,0,0,\ldots )$ to $(1/2, 1/2,1/2,\ldots )$? Said another way, for any natural number $n>1$, $[0,1]^n$ is NOT homogeneous, precisely because of these boundary points.  What allows you to deal with the boundary points in the infinite product case? As always, feel free to retag, and thanks in advance! Edit In the off chance that someone stumbles across this question, I just wanted to provide a rough idea of the answer, as garnered from the link Pete provided in his answer. If one has a point of the form $(1,p)$ in $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, then there is a self homeomorphism of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ taking $(1,p)$ to $(q,1)$ with $q\neq 0, 1$.  For example, one can use a ""square rotation"".  From here, the idea is simple:  given a point in $H$ of the form $(1, p_2, p_3, p_4,\ldots )$, apply the square rotation on the first two factors to get a new point of the form $(q_1, 1, p_2, p_3,\ldots )$.  Now, apply the square rotation on the second two factors to get a new point of the form $(q_1, q_2, 1, p_3,\ldots )$.  The point is that after $k$ iterations, the first $k$ coordinates are all in the interior. Now one proves a techinical lemma that states that the infinite composition of these homeomorphisms is a well defined homeomorphism.  The infinite composition maps the point $(1, p_2, \ldots )$ to a point of the form $(q_1, q_2,\ldots )$ which lies on the ""interior"" of $H$.  Finally, using the fact that $(0,1)$ is clearly homogeneous, one can easily map $(q_1, q_2,\ldots )$ to $(1/2,1/2,\ldots )$.",['general-topology']

2229,What is the commutative analogue of a $C^*$-subalgebra?,"Using the duality between locally compact Hausdorff spaces and commutative $C^*$-algebras one can write down a vocabulary list translating topological notions regarding a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ into algebraic notions ragarding its ring of functions $C_0(X)$ (see Wegge-Olsen's book, for instance). For example, we have the following correspondences:
\begin{align*}
\text{open subset of $X$}\quad &\longleftrightarrow\quad\text{ideal in $C_0(X)$}\newline
\text{dense open subset of $X$}\quad &\longleftrightarrow\quad\text{essential ideal in $C_0(X)$}\newline
\text{closed subset of $X$}\quad &\longleftrightarrow\quad\text{quotient of $C_0(X)$}\newline
\text{locally closed subset of $X$}\quad &\longleftrightarrow\quad\text{subquotient of $C_0(X)$}\newline
\text{???}\quad &\longleftrightarrow\quad\text{$C^*$-subalgebra in $C_0(X)$}
\end{align*}
By ideal I always mean a two-sided closed (and hence self-adjoint) ideal. Well, I can't quite see how to reconvert a $C^*$-subalgebra in $C_0(X)$ into something topological involving only the space $X$. Can you come up with something handy? Example: A simple example of a subalgebra of a commutative $C^*$-algebra not being an ideal is
$$
\mathbb C\cdot(1,1)\subset \mathbb C\oplus\mathbb C.

2237,"I've got the same answer to my question via probability and combinations, but I don't know why!","I am trying to find the answer to the following question: If I am playing poker and am dealt two cards neither of which are spades, what are the chances of two or more of the flop cards (the flop is the first three community cards) being spades. I answered this question in the following way: As I have no spades, there are still 13 spades unseen and a total of 50 cards remaining unseen (52 cards in the pack less my two cards which I've been dealt. If the probability of the first flop card being a spade is p(A) and the second p(B) and the third p(C) then I need to find: p((Aâˆ©B)âˆª(Aâˆ©C)âˆª(Bâˆ©C)) so given the formula: p(XâˆªYâˆªZ) = p(X) + p(Y) + p(Z) - p(Xâˆ©Y) - p(Xâˆ©Z) - p(Yâˆ©Z) + p(Xâˆ©Yâˆ©Z) I calculated: p(2 or more spades on flop) = 3(13/50 x 12/49) - 3((13/50 x 12/49) x 11/48) + (13/50 x 12/49 x 11/48) which gives 16.18% What I wanted to do next was solve the question using combinations. Through a process of trial and error I got the same answer, but am a bit confused as to why it works this way. My method was: 13C2 * 48 = 3744 3744 - (3 * 13C3) + 13C3 = 3172 total number possible 3 card combinations on flop = 50C3 = 19600 3172 / 19600 = 16.18% So I get the total number of 2 card combination of spades by 13C2 = 78. Then there are 48 other cards which can form combinations with each of these 2 card combination so 13C2 * 48. Now I'm losing my grasp of whats happening. Why does 13C2 = p(A) + p(B) + p(C)? All I have done to follow is find the number of combos for p(Aâˆ©B), p(Aâˆ©C), p(Bâˆ©C) and p(Aâˆ©Bâˆ©C) and then crunched the numbers as in the calculation shown above. But even though I (think I've) got the right answer, I've come to it in a try-it-and-see way and can't understand for instance why 13C2 * 48 doesn't give the right answer straight off. Surely that gives the number of 3 card combinations on the flop with 2 or more spades which is what I'm looking for, doesn't it? But I don't get the same answer as with the original calculation if I use that figure. Sorry for the waffle. I hope someone can see where my thinking is going wrong and can help explain the combinations part a bit better for me. Many thanks in advance.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

2278,"Can this algorithm on removing $1$'s from a $(0,1)$-matrix fail?","Let us be given a $n\times n$ matrix containing only zeros and ones.Now, the goal is to remove some 'ones' from the matrix (i.e. replace them with zeros) so that in each row and each column there is at most one 'one'. Of course, it is preferable that we leave as much 'ones' as it is possible (maximum is obviously $n$). Now, let us define the following algorithm: if there is a 'one' which is all alone in a column or a row, leave it there, and replace all 'ones' in its column and row with zeros. We repeat the process as long as there are single 'ones' in rows or columns. If there are no single 'ones' left, we take the first row or column (first is counted from up (for rows) and from left (for columns)) containing two 'ones' (if there are no pairs, we go for the first triplet and so on). In that pair (or triplet, or ...) we leave the first 'one' intact (first is counted from the left for elements of row, from the top for elements of a column) and change all other 'ones' in the row and column of that first 'one' into zeros.
Now, we check are there now any single 'ones' as defined above - if yes, we repeat that part of the algorithm, if no, we look for the first pair, triplet, etc. The algorithm ends when all 'ones' are singles both in their column and row. Does this algorithm always give the maximum covering, i.e. does it always terminate with maximal number of 'ones' in the final matrix? In other words, can there be a matrix with a possible exclusion of some ones such that it ends up with $n$ ones using some other exclusion scheme, while ending up with less than $n$ 'ones' using the algorithm described above?","['algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

The way I had been taught about rank was that it was the smallest of the number of rows bringing new information the number of columns bringing new information.

2355,Is there a group with exactly 92 elements of order 3?,"The number of elements of order 2 in a group is fairly restricted: 0, odd, or infinity.  All such possibilities occur already in the trivial group and in dihedral groups. The number of elements of order 3 in a group can be shown to be similarly restricted: 0, 2 mod 6, or infinity.  However, something strange happens: not all possibilities can be realized. Even worse, there is a fairly small number that I cannot decide whether it is or is not the number of elements of order 3 in a finite group: Is there a group with exactly 92 elements of order 3? More boldly, I would like to know (but feel free to answer only the first question): Exactly which numbers occur as the number of elements of order 3 in a group? Background : Such questions were studied a bit by Sylow and more heavily by Frobenius.  The theorem that the number of elements of order p is equal to âˆ’1 mod p is contained in one of Frobenius's 1903 papers.  Since elements of order 3 come in pairs, this doubles to give 2 mod 6 for p=3. However, Frobenius's results were improved some 30 years later by P. Hall who showed that if the Sylow p-subgroups are not cyclic, then the number of elements of order p is âˆ’1 mod p 2 . If the Sylows are cyclic of order p n , then the number of subgroups of order p is congruent to 1 mod p n by the standard counting method.  If the Sylow itself is order p, then the subgroup generated by the elements of order p acts faithfully and transitively on the Sylow subgroups, so for small enough numbers, the subgroup can just be looked up. In all cases, we can assume the group is finite since the subgroup generated by the elements of a fixed order is finite (assuming there are only finitely many elements of that fixed order). Easier example : For instance there is no group with exactly 68 elements of order 3, since such a group would have cyclic Sylow 3-subgroups by Hall, order 3 Sylows by the counting, but then would have 34 Sylow 3-subgroups, and so (the subgroup generated by the elements of order 3 would) be a primitive group of degree 34.  One checks the list of primitive groups of degree 34 (that is, A 34 and S 34 , both with ginormous Sylow 3-subgroups) to see no such group exists. One could also try 140, but the action need not be primitive so the table lookup is harder.  Such a group has Sylows of order 3, but is not solvable, so is somewhat restricted.",['group-theory']

For some reason I was reminded of it and thought it might be interesting to the visitors here.

So the problem is: Suppose $S \subset \mathbb{Z}$ (set of integers) such that 1) $|S| = 15$ 2) $\forall ~s \in S, \exists ~a,b \in S$ such that $s = a+b$ Show that for every such $S$, there is a non-empty subset $T$ of $S$ such that the sum of elements of $T$ is zero and $|T| \leq 7$. Update (Sep 13) Here is an approach which seems promising and others might be able to take it ahead perhaps. If you look at the set as a vector $s$, then there is a matrix $A$ with the main diagonal being all $1$, each row containing exactly one $1$ and one $-1$ (or a single $2$) in the non-diagonal position such that $As = 0$. The problem becomes equivalent to proving that for any such matrix $A$ the row space of $A$ contains a vector with all zeroes except for a $1$ and $-1$ or a vector with all zeroes except $\leq 7$ ones. This implies that the numbers in the set $S$ themselves don't matter and we can perhaps replace them with elements from a different field (like say reals, or complex numbers).",['combinatorics']
2419,"Asimov quote about ""eight million trillion"" arrangements of amino acids","A friend of mine is subediting a book whose author died in 1999.

My friend is faced with the following paragraph: According to Asimov, the amino acids of the proteins behave in a much freer way than our words do: they can be rearranged in any manner and always retain some meaning. A simple protein is made up of eight amino acids, which can be classified putting the numbers one to eight in a series, changing the order of sequence by one digit each time. Out of the same number of ""words"" we can construct a little over 40,000 organised ""biological phrases"" from the same genetic code, each one with its own meaning, which is the mission of every protein. But if the chains become longer, as in the case of more complicated molecules such as insulin, which consists of 30 amino acids, the tally rises to a staggering eight million trillion possibilities. The editor doesn't like ""eight million trillion"" and wants to replace it with ""800000..000"". The question, of course, is ""how many zeros""?

2483,Quadratic reciprocity via generalized Fibonacci numbers?,"This is a pet idea of mine which I thought I'd share.  Fix a prime $q$ congruent to $1 \bmod 4$ and define a sequence $F_n$ by $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$, and $\displaystyle F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + \frac{q-1}{4} F_n.$ Then $F_n = \frac{\alpha^n - \beta^n}{\alpha - \beta}$ where $\alpha, \beta$ are the two roots of $f(x) = x^2 - x - \frac{q-1}{4}$.  When $q = 5$ we recover the ordinary Fibonacci numbers.  The discriminant of $f(x)$ is $q$, so it splits $\bmod p$ if and only if $q$ is a quadratic residue $\bmod p$. If $\left( \frac{q}{p} \right) = -1$, then the Frobenius morphism $x \mapsto x^p$ swaps $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (working over $\mathbb{F}_p$), hence $F_p \equiv -1 \bmod p$.  And if $\left( \frac{q}{p} \right) = 1$, then the Frobenius morphism fixes $\alpha$ and $\beta$, hence $F_p \equiv 1 \bmod p$.  In other words, $\displaystyle F_p \equiv \left( \frac{q}{p} \right) \bmod p.$ Quadratic reciprocity in this case is equivalent to the statement that $\displaystyle F_p \equiv \left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \bmod p.$ Question: Does anyone have any ideas about how to prove this directly, thereby proving quadratic reciprocity in the case that $q \equiv 1 \bmod 4$?

2558,On applying the quadratic formula to a first-degree equation,"You're probably thinking, ""Why?""  Please let me explain... It is ( very ) well-known that $$ \forall (a,b,c,x) \in \mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^3: ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. $$ For some bizarre reason, I decided to try to solve $ bx + c = 0 $ using this formula by introducing a term $ \alpha x^2 $ and removing it in the limit $ \alpha \to 0 $.  Doing so with L'Hopital's rule, I find these solutions: $$ \displaystyle x_1 = \lim_{\alpha \to 0} {\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c \alpha}}{2 \alpha}} = \lim_{\alpha \to 0} {\frac{-c}{\sqrt{b^2 - 4c \alpha}}} = \frac{-c}{b}, $$ $$ \displaystyle x_2 = \lim_{\alpha \to 0} {\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c \alpha}}{2 \alpha}} = \infty. $$ The first was to be expected, but I still haven't been able to explain the second cleanly (that is, in a way other than ""since $ -c/b $ is gone, it couldn't be a true number""). In addition, carrying out the analogous process one degree lower yields a root at either zero or infinity, depending on the constant.  The latter possibility (which occurs when $ c \neq 0 $) corresponds to the unsolvable case, while the former (in which $ c = 0 $) corresponds to the trivially satisfied one, so a root at zero here appears to have a vastly different meaning from $ x_1 = 0 $ above, where $ x_1 $ gives the location of the unique, genuine root of $ bx + 0 = 0 $ provided $ b \neq 0 $. My question is why a solution at zero can have either of the two meanings just described, and whether the phantom root $ x_2 = \infty $ (obtained by treating the first-degree polynomial $ bx + c $ as a degenerate case of the second-degree one) has a meaningful interpretation.

For instance, we can easily show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number. Observe ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$. Since we do not know if ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$ is rational or not, there are two cases. ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$ is rational, and we are finished. ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$ is irrational, but if we raise it by ${\sqrt 2}$ again, we can see that
$$\left ( \sqrt 2 ^ \sqrt 2 \right ) ^ \sqrt 2 = \sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2} = \sqrt 2 ^ 2 = 2.$$ Either way, we have shown that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is rational.

If you list all possibilities for the sexes of two children, $BB, BG, GB, GG$, you see that $2$ of the $3$ pairs that have B (for boy) in them also have a girl, so the answer one could argue is $2/3$. On the other hand, one could argue that the answer is $1/2$, since the probability that any one child is a girl is $1/2$, and intuitively (?) should be independent of the gender of its siblings. Some background to possibly justify posting it here: the question was asked at an interview for an actuarial/insurance type position, and the interviewer said the answer was $2/3$, whereas my friend who was being interviewed (and has a masters in math) thought the answer was $1/2$, even after the interviewer explained his logic. My friend felt that the interviewer wasn't taking into account the fact that it is not equally likely that a boy will open the door in the $BB$ versus the $BG$ combination, and one has to take into account that fact.
