42999,Issue with textbook exercise on vectors,"the following is a question from my textbook on vectors: EDIT: Added text, so that the post is self-contained even without
the picture. The points $A$ and $B$ have position vectors
$\begin{pmatrix}2\\9\\t\end{pmatrix}$ and
$\begin{pmatrix}2t\\5\\3t\end{pmatrix}$ respectively. a. Find $\vec{AB}$. b. Find, in terms of $t$, $|\vec{AB}|$. c. Find the value of $t$ which makes $|\vec{AB}|$ a minimum. d. Find the minimum value of $|\vec{AB}|$. My issue is with part C. I accept the textbook's solution, as mine gives an incorrect answer but do not understand why their method is acceptable. Since the exercise is to find the value of t that makes vector AB a minimum, why is it acceptable to square vector AB and then differentiate, rather than just differentiating vector AB as it is, using the chain rule? I see how this leads to the problem of two t values, rather than one, but I didn't feel that it would be acceptable to just ignore one by squaring, and changing the original formula. What am I misunderstanding here? EDIT: Added text. (a) $\vec{AB}=\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{a}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\9\\t\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}2t\\5\\3t\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}2-2t\\-4\\2t\end{pmatrix}$ (b) $\begin{align}|\vec{AB}|&=\sqrt{(2-2t)^2+(-4)^2+{2t}^2}\\
&=\sqrt{4t^2-8t+4+16+4t^2}\\
&=\sqrt{8t^2-8t+20}

43096,Is it true that a space-filling curve cannot be injective everywhere?,"Here , it is said that a space-filling curve cannot be injective because ""that will make the curve a homeomorphism from the unit interval onto the unit square"", since every continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. That does mean there can be no injective mapping from $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]\!\times\![0,1]$, but it doesn't really tell us anything about mappings from noncompact intervals onto the unit square. In the case of the ordinary Peano-Hilbert curve, it does not help much: the construction has infinitely (only countably, though) many inherent points of overlap (discussed here: In what way is the Peano curve not one-to-one with $[0,1]^2$? ), but I can't really see any reason why there could not be a space-filling curve without such points. Of course, the curve's inverse could not be continuous, but when mapping from a noncompact interval it wouldn't need to be! After all, there are other curves mapping noncompact spaces bijectively to compact ones in a continuous way, but with noncontinuous inverse, like the obvious $[0,2\pi[\to S^1$.","['general-topology', 'analysis']"

OK, one may say that it quite depends on the context. It may be too vague to ask such questions here. Let me ""rephrase"" the question a little bit: When can one expect a classical solution of a PDE? Is there a rule of thumb for when a PDE may fail to have a classical solution , such that one has to look for a weak one?

The main missing point, in my opinion, is the fact that length of curves is defined using polygonal approximations (discrete approximation of the curve obtained by taking the straight-lines connecting a finite sequence of points on the curve). However, a layman would ask ""why is your strange 'polygonal approximation' method correct, but the $\pi = 4$ proof's method incorrect?"" and I have to admit I fail to see strong arguments to convince him here.

43174,A proof of the Riesz representation theorem,"I'm having trouble filling the steps in this guided proof of Riesz's representation theorem. (I already have a proof I can understand, but I'd like to understand this one too.) Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, and $\varphi : H \to \mathbb{C}$ a bounded linear functional. If $\varphi = 0$ then we are done; otherwise, by scaling, we may assume without loss of generality that $\| \varphi \| = 1$. So, for each $n$, there is a unit vector $h_n$ in $H$ such that $| \varphi(h_n) | > 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By multiplying each one by an appropriate complex number of unit modulus, we may assume $\varphi(h_n) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\varphi(h_n) > 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. Now I run into a problem — I can see that everything follows from the first step, but the first step is eluding me at the moment. $h_n \longrightarrow h$ for some $h$ in $H$. Why? If $H$ is finite-dimensional then certainly there is a convergent subsequence, but I don't see how we can assert the existence of such an $h$ without knowing more about the relative distances of the $h_n$. $h$ is orthogonal to the kernel of $\varphi$. I think the idea here is to show that $\| h - u \|$ is minimised over $u \in \ker \varphi$ when $u = 0$, by exploiting the fact that $\| h - u \| \ge | \varphi(h - u) | = | \varphi(h) | = 1$. $\ker \varphi \oplus \operatorname{span} \{ h \} = H$, by e.g. rank–nullity or orthogonal decomposition. Hence $\varphi(x) = \langle x, h \rangle$ for all $x \in H$, by decomposing $x$ using the above decomposition of $H$ and linearity.","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'riesz-representation-theorem']"

43220,"Sylow $p$-subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}(2,K)$ for $K$ infinite and $p$ odd","Is every maximal $p$-subgroup of $\operatorname{PGL}(2,K)$ conjugate, where $p$ is an odd prime not equal to the characteristic of $K$? Here $\operatorname{PGL}(2,K)$ is the quotient group of the group of $2×2$ invertible matrices with entries from the field $K$ modulo the group of nonzero $K$-scalar of multiplies the identity matrix. The only $p$-subgroups are isomorphic to the locally cyclic groups of $p^n$th roots of unity in $F$, where $[F :K]≤2$, that is, $F$ is a quadratic field extension of $K$ or $F = K$.  Assuming the $p$-subgroup generates $F$ over $K$ and is not the identity when $F = K$, the normalizers are (generalized) dihedral groups, $\operatorname{Dih}(F^×)$, which proves the maximality of the full groups of roots of $p^n$th roots of unity in $F$. In the finite field case, things are easier. $F^×/K^×$ has order $q+1$ and $K^×$ has order $q−1$, so either $p$ divides the first, or $p$ divides the second, and thus all $p$-subgroups of the same order are conjugate just by bringing their torus into line.  This is not surprising since the maximal $p$-subgroups are conjugate by Sylow's theorem, and cyclic, so have a single subgroup of each order. In the infinite field case, I am not quite as certain.  For one thing, the quadratic $F$ is no longer uniquely defined by $K$, so I'm not sure to what extent the non-split tori are conjugate.  Even worse, I'm not even sure that one cannot have a maximal $p$-subgroup of $K$-type and a maximal $p$-subgroup of $F$-type.",['group-theory']

43250,Cutoff functions are not nice in their first derivative,"This afternoon, while working out this answer by Nate Eldredge , I made some vain attempts at building cutoff functions of various kinds. Especially I was looking for the following. Can a sequence $\zeta_n \in C^\infty(-1, 1)$ s.t. $0 \le \zeta_n \le 1$ and $\zeta_n(0)=1, \zeta(-1)=\zeta(1)=0$; $\lVert \zeta_n-1\rVert_2 \to 0$; $\lVert \zeta'_n \rVert_2$ is bounded exist? Graphically I was looking for something like this: (in red the graph of $\zeta_n(x)=\exp(\frac{1/n}{x^2-1})$, in black the scaled graph of its first derivative). The task was to arrange things so that those black peaks stayed $L^2$-bounded. After many unsuccessful trials I've come to the conclusion that such a $\zeta_n$ cannot exist. In fact, it should be $H^1$-bounded and so, up to a subsequence, $H^1$-weakly convergent. This implies $L^2$-weak convergence and so we should have $\zeta_n \stackrel{H^1}{\rightharpoonup}1$. But now we observe that $\zeta_n \in H^1_0(-1, 1)$. $H^1_0(-1, 1)$ is a norm-closed subspace of $H^1(-1,1)$, and so - because of its convexity - it is also weakly closed. We have thus gotten the contradiction $1 \in H^1_0(-1, 1)$. Two questions: Is this reasoning correct? If 1. is affirmative, is there a more elementary way to see this? I've

43263,If a function can only be defined implicitly does it have to be multivalued?,"What is the general reason for functions which can only be defined implicitly? Is this because they are multivalued (in which case they aren't strictly functions at all)? Is there a proof? Clarification of question.

The third part was automatically answered because there can't be a proof that necessarily implicit functions are all multivalued by way of the example of one that wasn't.

43264,Double-cover of a Klein-bottle-esque Space,"I'm trying to complete the following exercise I found in a topology book: Construct a space A which is path-connected with fundamental group equal to $\langle r,s | r^2 s^3 r^3 s^2 = 1\rangle$, and find a unique (connected) double-covering B. Find some presentation also for $\Pi_1(B)$. Now the space I had in mind for A was a 10-sided polygon with edges identified, much like they are in (say) the Klein bottle, the first 2 edges identified in the same direction, and also identified with the 6th, 7th and 8th edges in that direction, and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th and 10th edges identified all in the same direction too. Then by Seifert Van-Kampen we can remove a small disc in the center of the polygon to get the fundamental gp we want. However, I am having problems picturing any sort of sensible double-cover for A: could anyone suggest anything? For something like the Klein bottle it's reasonably easy to just join another Klein bottle on at one of the edges to get a torus, but can we do the same here? Just add another copy of A associated at 1 edge (or all edges)? I'm not entirely sure how it works.

However, if we have a collection of isomorphisms $\{\psi_p:F_p\rightarrow G_p\}_{p\in X}$, this does not guarantee that $F$ and $G$ are isomorphic, because the $\psi_p$ might not be related to each other, i.e. there might not be a sheaf map $\psi:F\rightarrow G$ such that $\psi_p$ is the induced stalk map for all $p\in X$.

What bothers/intrigues me is that I cannot understand how a closed surface in 3D space CANNOT be orientable. Surely every closed surface is orientable! My highly non-rigorous, intuitive argument runs as follows: 1) As the surface is closed, we can define two regions, one inside the surface, and one outside 2) We can construct a normal to the surface at any point P that is pointing towards the inside region. Thus the direction of the normal is defined for every point. 3) As the surface is piecewise continuous, this normal will vary continuously. 4) Coupling (2) (defined direction of normal) with (3) (continuously changing normal) gives us an orientation for the closed surface. 5) Therefore every closed surface is orientable. But of course, the precise wording of the statement for Gauss' Law strongly suggests that people far smarter than me have discovered some exotic non-orientable, closed surface. Is this true?

43650,Minimum value of $x+4z$ subject to the constraint $x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 2$?,"Consider the following problem: Let $f:{\mathbb R}^3 \to{\mathbb R}$ be $$f(x,y,z)=x+4z$$ where $$x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 2.$$ Find the minimum of $f$. This is similar to the question here . However, since this is not an analytic function with complex variable, one may not be able to use the ""Maximum modulus principle"". What I think is that one may rewrite the inequality constraint $x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 2$ as 
$$x^2+y^2+z^2=2-\delta\qquad \delta\in[0,2]$$
then one can use the ""Lagrange Multiplier Method"" with the parameter $\delta$. Or one can do it on the xOz plane with the geometric meaning of $C$ in $C=x+4z$. Is there any other way better than the idea above to solve this problem?",['multivariable-calculus']

It is of central importance in Signal Processing and Statistics, where it is used for matrix completion and dimensionality reduction. A question I have is whether it's possible to compute the nuclear norm of a given matrix faster than the time needed to compute the SVD. Since we don't need all the singular values but only their sum, this seem possible. Alternatively, perhaps it could be possible to approximate it with simulation methods and/or random projections.","['svd', 'linear-algebra', 'singular-values', 'nuclear-norm', 'numerical-linear-algebra']"
43692,Direct sum commuting with homology functor,"I'm trying to understand a fact about commutation between homology functors and direct sums. In particular, let $G$ be a group of type $FP$ (i.e. there exists a projective resolution of finite length $P_\bullet\to\mathbb{Z}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$G): I should prove that the functor $H^k(G,-)$ commutes with the direct sum.
I don't get how to use the assumption about the type $FP$: I've tried to write a proof but in my mind I cannot relate the commutativity with that property. I mean: I'm trying to explicitly write elements in $H^k(G,\bigoplus_i A_i)$ and in $\bigoplus_i H^k(G,A_i)$ in order to find a nice map between them, but the definition is too complicated because I have to take elements which belong to the kernel but not to the image of some boundary operators in a chain complex obtained applying the functor $Hom_G(-,A_i)$ to another chain complex which is itself a resolution of projective modules etc. etc.  well... it's just too much!

43745,Minimal number of solutions to a sudoku cube,"A ""Sudoku cube"" is a 3x3x3 uncoloured Rubik's cube. In the solved state, each face has the digits 1 through 9 arranged in ascending rows from top to bottom, and all of the digits on a given face have the same orientation. When designing such a cube, each of the 6 faces has 4 possible orientations in a fixed frame of reference. Assume that cube designs that can be transformed into one another by rotation of the entire cube are equivalent. The orientations of the faces affects the number of possible solutions to the cube, if each cuboid is taken as distinct. Take the following cube, where the orientation of a face is given as the direction of the top of the digits on that face: Top face—backward. Back face—downward. Bottom face—frontward. Front face—upward. There are four possible positions that the left and right faces can each take while preserving the solved state, yielding 16 obvious solutions and probably many more. What set of orientations for all of the cube's faces yields the lowest number of valid solutions, and what is that lower bound?","['recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

Then, $x$ and $b$ are perturbed by vectors $p$ and $q$ such that: $A(x+p) = (b+q)$ The question asks to solve for $p$ in terms of $q$. To approach this, I am thinking of finding $x$ by using the first equation, and then plug that $x$ into the second equation. Then, I can solve $p$ in terms of $q$. Do you think this (plugging in $x$ to the second equation) is acceptable? That is, is $x$ the same in both equations?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

So here is my question: How to show that the equality is true? I think it is equivalent to show that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^1\frac{1}{1+x^n}dx=1$$

43796,Explicit Riemann mappings,"Typical proofs of the Riemann mapping theorem are not terribly explicit (one maximizes a functional, or something equivalent, such as using Dirichlet's principle ). The theorem states that if $U$ is a simply connected open subset of the plane, then there is a biholomorphism between $U$ and the unit disk. I imagine, due to the wild generality of the result, no explicit construction can be expected in general. However, in many concrete cases, I would think a construction ""by hand"" should be possible; and in applications (to problems in engineering, for example), this would almost be a requirement. Do you know of such a construction, or of a reference where these constructions are discussed? (The answer may of course only apply to certain families of open sets.) I know of a very nice reference: ""Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping"", by Tobin A. Driscoll and Lloyd N. Trefethen, Cambridge Monographs on Applied and Computational Mathematics (No. 8). The Schwarz-Christoffel Mappings explicitly give us biholomorphisms between the upper half plane and the interior of simple polygons .

43801,"For an integrable function $f$, do continuity conditions on its integral affect continuity of $f$?","In this question, whenever I say ""integrable"" I mean ""Riemann-integrable"". The (first) fundamental theorem of calculus states: if $f\in C[a,b]$, then the function $F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\, dt$ is continuous in $[a,b]$, differentiable in $(a,b)$ and $F'(x)=f(x)$ in $(a,b)$. Now, a (sort of?) converse would read: if $f$ is an integrable function in $[a,b]$ such that the function $F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\, dt$ is $C^1[a,b]$, then $f$ is continuous. This is not true, as the answers below put it, it suffices to alter a continuous function on a point, which does not alter the $C^1$-ness of its integral. Now I ask this: are these all the counterexamples? Does there exist a counterexample which is not of this kind, i.e. a continuous function save for a removable discontinuity? To clarify: a function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is said to have a removable discontinuity in a point $c\in [a,b]$ if both one-sided limits (or the one that is defined, in case of $a$ or $b$) exist and are equal.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"
