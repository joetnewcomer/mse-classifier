1305625,"Disprove, fix, prove: If {$a_n$} and {$b_n$} are increasing, then {$a_n b_n$} is increasing","Prove the statement wrong, fix it, then prove the new statement: If {$a_n$} and {$b_n$} are increasing, then {$a_n b_n$} is increasing. I think I'm headed in the right direction with this but I'm not sure. What I've tried: Consider the increasing sequence $\{\frac{-1}{n}\}$. Then $\{(\frac{-1}{n})(\frac{-1}{n})\}=\{\frac1{n^2}\}$. Since $\{\frac1{n^2}\}$ is decreasing, it makes a counterexample to the statement.
The statement can then be amended: If $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ are increasing and $a_n>0 $and $b_n>0$ for every $n\ge1$, then $\{a_n b_n\}$ is increasing. Proof: Since $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ are increasing, we know that $a_{n+1}>a_n$ and $b_{n+1}>b_n$. Then consider two cases for the value of $b_n$: (i) If $b_n>0$, then $(a_n)(b_n)<(a_{n+1})(b_{n+1}) \implies a_nb_n<a_{n+1}b_{n+1}$ and $\{a_nb_n\}$ is increasing. (ii) If $b_n<0$, then $(a_n)(b_n)<(a_{n+1})(b_{n+1}) \implies a_nb_n>a_{n+1}b_{n+1}$ and $\{a_nb_n\}$ is decreasing.

But then I realized that it is impossible for any $z_{k+1}$ if I do not change values of $e_1,\dots,e_k$ because $|z_p|\le1$, but $|L|\le\sqrt2$.

1305839,Showing that the gradient is orthogonal to level surface,"It is well known that the gradient of a function (which is sufficiently well behaving) $g(x)$ is orthogonal to its level surface, for example $g(x)=0$. I have seen the following derivation of this fact in a book I am following: We first note that at any point on the constraint surface the gradient $\nabla g(x)$ of
  the constraint function will be orthogonal to the surface. To see this, consider a point
  $x$ that lies on the constraint surface, and consider a nearby point $x + \epsilon$ that also lies
  on the surface. If we make a Taylor expansion around $x$, we have $g(x + \epsilon) \approx g(x) + \epsilon^T\nabla g(x)$. Because both $x$ and $x+ \epsilon$ lie on the constraint surface, we have $g(x) = g(x+ \epsilon)$ and
  hence $\epsilon^T \nabla g(x) \approx 0$. In the limit $||\epsilon|| \to 0$ we have $\epsilon^T \nabla g(x)=0$, and because $\epsilon$ is then parallel to the constraint surface $g(x) = 0$, we see that the vector $\nabla g$ is normal
  to the surface. I am trying to build a complete proof out of this description. By the definition of differentiability it should be:
$$ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\dfrac{|g(x + \epsilon) - g(x) - \epsilon^{T}\nabla g(x)|}{||\epsilon||}=0 \tag{1}$$ Since $x + \epsilon$ is assumed to be on the level surface, we have $ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\dfrac{|- \epsilon^{T}\nabla g(x)|}{||\epsilon||}=0$. But the problematic part is we only consider $\epsilon$ which causes $x+\epsilon$ to be on the level surface. The classic delta-epsilon limit evaluation covers all possible $\epsilon$, so I can't imagine a way to modify this to work with only ""feasible"" $\epsilon$, as stated in the description. Moreover, in the limit $||\epsilon|| \to 0$  $\epsilon$ disappears and I can't see how we can say that it is parallel to the surface there; it just does not make sense. So, how can we build a proof which follows the given description above? I think the definition of the derivative at $(1)$ is the starting point but I can't see how it should go on.","['calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

1306062,Covariant derivative of a constant inner product and how it decomposes into local coordinates,"I wanted to confirm that my explicit (symbolic) computations of the covariant derivative of a constant inner product is (carefully) done right and correct. For the physicists (includes me), this is useful when thinking about 4-velocities. The defining property of a 4-velocity $u$ is this: $
u\cdot u \equiv u^{\flat}(u) \equiv g(u,u) = u_{\mu} u^{\mu} = g_{\mu \nu}u^{\mu} u^{\nu} = -1
$ For $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$ (smooth function on manifold $M$), $\nabla_u f = u(f) = u_i\frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x^i} \, \text{(locally)}$.  So clearly $\nabla_u (-1) =0$. Then is the chain rule or Leibnitz rule still valid for the so-called inner product $u\cdot u = u_{\mu} u^{\mu}$ so that $
\nabla_v (u_{\gamma} u^{\gamma} ) = u_{\gamma} \nabla_v u^{\gamma} + u^{\gamma} \nabla_v u_{\gamma} = 0 
$
? For the special case of $v=u$ (taking the covariant derivative with respect to $u$, or however it's called), and for a Levi Civita connection $\nabla$, so that one (of 2) of its defining properties being $\nabla g = 0$, so that 
$\nabla_{\gamma} g_{\mu \nu}=0$ Then 
$ u^{\gamma} \nabla_u u_{\gamma} = u^{\gamma}\nabla_u g_{\gamma \nu} u^{\nu} = u^{\gamma} g_{\gamma \nu} u^{\sigma} \nabla_{\sigma}u^{\nu} = u_{\nu} \nabla_u u^{\nu}$ So then $\nabla_u (u_{\gamma} u^{\gamma}) = 2 u_{\gamma} \nabla_u u^{\gamma} = 0 $. Then I can conclude that, assuming a Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$, $u\cdot u =-1$ also means that $u_{\nu} \nabla_u u^{\nu} =0$ Is this all correct?

These constructions are very useful to build up exotic counterexamples (for example rings being left noetherian and not right noetherian). In these days I am studying some theory of valuation rings, and my professor showed me a new way of constructing rings. Suppose $R \subseteq S$ is an extension of commutative rings (with unity), and $I$ is an ideal of $S$. Then the following is a subring of $S$:
  $$R+I = \{ r+i : r \in R, i \in I\}$$ This construction is used for example to build the ring $\Bbb{Z}+x\Bbb{Q}[[x]]$, which is a local domain of dimension $2$ dominated by $\Bbb{Q}[[x]]$. I found this simple idea very easy to understand and actually it is useful to build up new things. However, I wonder why I never saw it in my life (for example it does not appear in Atiyah-MacDonald, or other books of commutative algebra). My question is: Does this construction have a name? Where can I find some references to study such rings? Is there any reason why it is so poorly considered?","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

Therefore, if we write the following term, we'll make it bigger: $$=\left|\frac{1}{\cos x_1}-\tan x_1\right|<\left|\frac{1}{\cos x_1}-0\right|$$ Now we will choose $\delta=\frac{\cos x_1}{\epsilon}$ : $$\left|\frac{1}{\cos x_1}-0\right|<\frac{\cos x_1}{\epsilon}$$ Divide by $\cos x_1$ which is positive in the open interval $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ : $$\left|\frac{1}{1}\right|<\frac{1}{\epsilon}<\epsilon$$ Did I get it right?

I wonder whether the right-hand side can be expressed as a weighted sum of cosine functions with positive coefficients, i.e., whether a ""difference"" formula can be a sum formula. For concreteness I formulate the following question: Given $a_0>0$, do there exist $a_i\ge 0$ and $b_i$ such that 
$$\sin (a_0x)\sin x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i\cos b_i x?$$ With a restriction on $a_0$ and $b_i$, namely that $a_0, b_i\in \mathbb{N}$, the uniqueness of Fourier series implies that the problem has no solutions. Even more simply, we can evaluate both sides at $x=0$ to see that the equality cannot hold. To fix this, I ask the following modified question:
Given $a_0>0$, do there exist $a_i\ge 0$ and $b_i$ and $\mathrm{err}_{a_0}=\mathrm{err}$ such that 
$$\sin (a_0x)\sin x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i\cos b_i x +\mathrm{err}(x)$$
where the function err is an arbitrary sine series, namely,
$$\mathrm{err}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}c_i\sin d_ix$$

My following derivatives are $$\small {u_{x_i}=(2-n)\left(\frac 1{1+|x|^2} \right)^{\frac{n-2}2}\left(\frac 1{1+|x|^2} \right) |x| x_i  \text{ and } (u_\lambda)_{x_i}=(2-n)\left(\frac {\lambda}{\lambda^2+|x|^2} \right)^{\frac{n-2}2}\left(\frac 1{\lambda^2+|x|^2} \right) |x| x_i,}$$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$.

1307099,"Locally open maps are open - any reference, and/or applications?","From John M. Lee, Introduction to Topological Manifolds (2nd ed. 2011, pp. 20 & 27) (in 1st ed. 2000, page 18 & 21, the wording is similar, but the relevant propositions are differently numbered): If X is a topological space and $p \in X,$ a neighborhood of $p$ is just an open subset of $X$ containing $p.$ [...] (In some books, the word ""neighborhood” is used in the more general sense of a subset containing an open subset containing $p$ [...]; but for us neighborhoods are always open subsets.) [...] In metric spaces, one usually first defines what it means for a map to be continuous at a point (see Appendix B), and then a continuous map is one that is continuous at every point. In topological spaces, continuity at a point is not such a useful concept. However, it is an important fact that continuity is a “local” property, in the sense that a map is continuous if and only if it is continuous in a neighborhood of every point. The precise statement is given in the following important proposition. Proposition 2.19 (Local Criterion for Continuity). A map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces is continuous if and only if each point of $X$ has a neighborhood on which (the restriction of) $f$ is continuous. It is easy to prove (in much the same way as Lee proves this lemma), that the same result is true with the word ""open"" in place of ""continuous"". To be explicit (the result is so easy that it hardly seems necessary, but it makes for easier reference - also, even with ""easy"" results, it is equally easy to make silly mistakes - at least for me it is): Lemma (Local Criterion for Openness) A map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces is open if and only if each point of $X$ has a neighbourhood on which (the restriction of) $f$ is open. Proof. The ""only if"" part is trivial ($X$ itself is a neighbourhood of each of its points). For the ""if"" part, let $U$ be open in $X$.  Any point of $f(U)$ is of the form $f(x)$, where $x \in U$.  Given such $x$, let $V$ be a neighbourhood of $x$ on which $f$ (restricted to $V$) is open.  Then $U \cap V$ and $f(U \cap V)$ are open, and $x \in U \cap V \subset U$, therefore $f(x) \in f(U \cap V)
\subset f(U)$, so $f(x)$ has a neighbourhood contained in $f(U)$. Therefore $f(U)$ is open. Q.E.D. This is stated as an exercise, for metric spaces only, in Arlen Brown & Carl Pearcy, An Introduction to Analysis (1995), but I haven't seen it stated anywhere else. (My search was not thorough.) Is it not stated anywhere (in full generality) because, unlike the result for continuous functions, it is not an ""important"" result? Or, can anybody give a reference to its general statement?

Q1 . Is it also true that given some zero dimensional, compact, Hausdorff space $X$ one have a homeomorphism $X \cong S(CO(X))$? Q2 Is it true that this theorem establishes an equivalence of catgeories of Boolean algebras and zero dimensional, compact Hausdorff spaces? From the other hand, there is also a following theorem: Every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets. Q3 In some notes I found this theorem but with additional assumption that the algebra has to be complete and atomic. I wonder what is the difference: my guess is that the above theorem states that given a boolean algebra $B$ one can find a set $X$ and an embedding of $B$ into $2^X$. And there is a result which states that this embedding is in fact isomorphism provided that $B$ is complete and atomic. Please correct me if I'm wrong or confirm if I'm right. Q4 Do we also have an equivalence of categories of complete atomic Boolean algebras and sets?

I also apologize for the lack of brevity. I am asking from the perspective of someone with only an undergraduate mathematics degree and a small amount of slightly more advanced self-study in differential geometry and topology that would like to work toward an understanding of the second half of Gradient Flows In Metric Spaces and in the Space of Probability Measures by Ambrosio, Gigli and Savare. I am aware that this is an advanced area that relies on many others and thus the present question. I have read the post on mathoverflow: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43083/textbooks-or-notes-on-gradient-flows-in-metric-spaces as well as the post: Gradient flows in metric spaces on stackexchange. Additionally, I have taken taken a look at the notes linked to in the above, some of which is accessible to me and some of which is not. I feel that I am sufficiently distant skill-wise from what is needed to read the material that textbooks are probably the first place that I want to head. It has been pointed out, for example, that Optimal Transport, old and new by Cédric Villani is useful and have begun to take a look at that. This is a good example however as, optimal transport itself touches a diversity of mathematical areas. Investigating the references (on Arxiv), I finds a wide array of core mathematics that are used by the authors in referenced material: analysis and ODEs, differential/Riemannian geometry, metric geometry, analysis of PDEs, probability... Related to these are other areas, e.g., geometric measure theory, which is itself a good example of the interdependance of material (differential geometry, measure theory, calculus of variations, analysis). This interdependence, while exciting to the uninitiated, does not allow for a quick understanding of what, exactly, the prerequisites are and what the ""prerequisites to the prerequisites"" may be in some limited cases. Finally, in related/referenced work, one also sees technical material accessible mainly to experts in say geometry, e.g., Gromov's Metric Structures for Riemannian and Non-Riemannian Spaces which I bring up as an example because in this case, it would be great for someone to provide a pointer to A Course in Metric Geometry by Burago^2 and Ivanov. Ideally, that is the kind of information I am looking for. For example responses along the lines of, ""Well, the book and related research rely heavily on results from metric geometry, some of which are available only in advanced monographs. A good introduction to the field is A Course in Metric Geometry ."" Or perhaps responses like, ""For the PDE-related material, a thorough understanding of Evan's book is sufficient."" Or, ""Check out Stroock's books on probability, analysis and PDE."" I have found the notes, blibiography and even the preliminary remarks and program from the course at https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vangaans/topicsinanalysis2011.html to be helpful in beginning to situate myself. It seems there is material from analysis, measure theory, probability, optimal transport, ODE, PDE, stochastic processes and other fields that must be mastered in order to really engage with this material. As I am beginning this process as a self-study to hopefully be continued in graduate school, I am really just looking for a list of prerequisite math, good references to learning those areas, and tips on the knowledge that one must accumulate in order to understand the above book (especially the second half) at the level of applying it and reading related papers in the field.

1307187,Exercise from Pugh's Real Analysis Regarding Zero Derivative on Open Subsets of $\mathbb{R}^m$,"Assume that $U$ is a connected open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f:U\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is differentiable everywhere on $U$. If $(Df)_p=0$ for all $p\in U$, show that $f$ is constant. I immediately thought that this would be equal to showing that if $\text{grad}(f)$ is $0$ everywhere on an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$, then $f$ is constant on that subset, thus enabling us to use the generalized MVT: for any $[a,b]$ contained in $U$ we have $|f(p)-f(q)|\le\max\{\text{grad}(f)\}|p-q|$, and since $\text{grad}(f)=0$ everywhere on $U$, we get $f(p)=f(q)$ for all $p,q\in U$. Is this sufficient? Pugh remarks that ""the enjoyable open and closed argument is left to you as Exercise 20"", suggesting that more is required. :\ Any help is appreciated","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"
1307201,Is this correct or completely wrong?,"I've bumped onto the problem described below and I couldn't tell if it is wrong. It looks like it could be correct but it makes no physical sense. Thank you!
Marcelo! I begin with
$$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^{\frac{n}{1-n}\cdot \frac{-1}{-1}} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^\frac{-n}{n-1}$$
and since $a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$,
$$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{\frac{n}{1-n}}$$
but this does not seem correct.","['physics', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1307209,Ordered square is not path connected,"Could someone clarify the countability part in Munkres' proof that the ordered square is not path connected (Munkres Topology, Chapter 24, Example 6) The proof proceeds as follows: Let $p = 0 \times 0$ and $q = 1 \times 1$. Suppose there is a path $f: [a,b] \to I_o^2$ joining p and q. By the intermediate value theorem, $f([a,b])$ must contain every point $x \times y$ of $I_o^2$. So, for each $x \in I$, define $U_x = f$$^-$$^1(x \times (0,1))$. The sets $U_x$ are non-empty, open in [a, b] by continuity of $f$, and disjoint. Choose for each $x \in I$ a rational number $q_x \in U_x$. Thus since $U_x$ are disjoint, the map $x \mapsto q_x$ is an injective mapping of $I$ onto $\Bbb Q$ thus contradicting that the interval $I$ is uncountable. My question is how $x \mapsto q_x$ can be injective if it's taking $x \in [0,1] \subset \Bbb R$ to $q_x \in (0,1) \subset \Bbb Q$.","['elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology']"
1307210,"$X$ and $Y$ are schemes of finite type over $S$, then $X \times_S Y$ is of finite type over $S$","If $X$ and $Y$ are schemes of finite type over $S$, then $X \times_S Y$ is of finite type over $S$. I was reading a solution but it's not complete. Attempt of proof Let $f:X\to S$ and $g:Y\to S$ be the corresponding morphisms of finite type. Let $\pi_Y: X \times_S Y \to Y$ be the projection to $Y$. Consider the compositions: $$ X \times_S Y \xrightarrow{\pi_Y}  Y \xrightarrow{g} S $$ Recall that compositions between morphisms of finite type is again of finite type. It's enough to show that $\pi_Y$ is of finite type. I read that $\pi_Y$ is of finite type because that $f$ is of finite type but I don't know how to prove this implication",['algebraic-geometry']
1307215,If $H \leq G$ and $[G:H]! \leq |G|$ then $G$ is not simple,"I'm looking for verification: My claim: If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a (proper)subgroup of index $k>1$, where $k! \leq |G|$, then $G$ is not simple. Proof: Consider the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$: $$G/H = \{H,g_1H,\dots,g_kH\}$$ Then $\phi: G \rightarrow S_{G/H}$ is a homomorphism where we define: $$\phi(g)[g_iH] = g g_iH$$ ($S_{G/H}$ is the group of permutations on elements of $G/H$ and of course $S_{G/H} \cong S_k$.) Also $\ker \phi \neq G$ because $\phi(g_1)$ is clearly not the identity in $S_{G/H}$. Because $\phi$ is a homomorphism, $$ G/\ker\phi \cong \text{im}\phi$$ Then $|\text{im} \phi| \leq |S_k| = k!$ and if $k! \leq |G|$ then $|\ker\phi| > 1$ and $\ker\phi$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$. Example: If a group of order $36$ has a subgroup of index $3$ or $4$ then the group is not simple.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'simple-groups']"

1307247,"Show the set of all functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\{0, 1\}$ is uncountable using a contradiction.","This is what I have written: By contradiction, assume it is countable. Write $S=\{\text{all functions } \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\} \}$. Then, we can find a bijection $\mathcal{H}: S \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Now, I would like to check how to incorporate Cantor's method to find the contradiction. Would it be right to think of each function as a binary representation (because they map to either $0$ or $1$)? So, I will write $f(1) \mapsto a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}...$ $f(2) \mapsto a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}...$ $f(3) \mapsto a_{31}a_{32}a_{33}...$ where $a_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$. and so on. So for example, $f(1)$ has input any natural number, so it will spit out either a $0$ or a $1$, and I have written all possibilities in a list. Then, I define a function in $S$ that is $0$ if a string value is $1$ and $1$ if the string value is $0$. I have one more question: what is the meant by the notation $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$?
