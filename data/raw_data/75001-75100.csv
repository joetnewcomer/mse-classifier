931212,How do I find $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x\cot(6x) $ without using L'Hôpital's rule?,"How do I find $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x\cot(6x) $ without using L'Hôpital's rule? I'm a freshman in college in the 3rd week of a calculus 1 class. I know the $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x\cot(6x) = \frac{1}{6}$ by looking at the graph, but I'm not sure how to get here without using L'Hôpital's rule. Here is how I solved it (and got the wrong answer). Hopefully someone could tell me where I went wrong. $$\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x\cot(6x) = (\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x) (\lim\limits_{x \to 0}\cot(6x)) = (0)\left(\lim\limits_{x \to 0}\frac{\cos(6x)}{\sin(6x)}\right) = (0)(\frac{1}{0}).$$ Therefore the limit does not exist. I am also unsure of how to solve $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(5x)}{7x^2} $ without using L'Hôpital's rule.","['limits-without-lhopital', 'calculus', 'limits']"

931277,Convergence in probability and convergence of Cesaro means,"Consider the random variable $X_n$, not necessarily iid. If $X_n\rightarrow 0$ almost surely, then the Cesaro means $\frac 1n\sum_{k=1}^nX_n$ converge almost surely to 0. This cannot be weakened to convergence in probability, as has been discussed here before by considering an independent sequence $\{X_n\}$, such that $X_n=2^n,$ with probability $1/n$,and $X_n=0$ with probability $1-1/n$. My question is, if $|X_n|\leq 1$ surely, does convergence in probability of $X_n$ to zero imply the almost sure convergence of $\frac 1n\sum_{k=1}^nX_k$ to zero?","['probability-theory', 'law-of-large-numbers', 'convergence-divergence', 'real-analysis']"

931349,A linear combination of characteristic functions is a characteristic function?,"Let $\phi_k(t)$ be the characteristic function of a random variable $X_k$, $k = 1,2,\dots$. Consider a set of positive real numbers $\{p_1, p_2, \dots \}$, take a function: 
$$\phi(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_k\phi_k(t)$$
What is the conditions on $\{p_1, p_2, \dots \}$ such that $\phi$ is a characteristic function? I know that a characteristic function need to satisfy following properties:
$$\phi(0) = 1$$
$$\phi(-t) = \overline{\phi(t)}$$
$$|\phi(t)|=\left|E[e^{itX}]\right|\leq E|e^{itX}|=1$$
$$|\phi(t+h)-\phi(t)|\leq E|e^{ihX}-1|$$
$$E[e^{it(aX+b)}]=e^{itb}\phi(at)$$ But I think only satisfy these properties will not ensure that $\phi(t)$ is a characteristic function for some random variables.

931367,Prove that this Newton sum value is unique,"$$\begin{align}a+b+c+d&=1\\ a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2&=2\\ a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3&=3\\ a^4+b^4+c^4+d^4&=4\\ a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5&- ?\end{align}$$ The usual method I see for solving this kind of problems is bashing using the Newton sums. Let $P_n=a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$. If we take $a,b,c,d$ to be the roots of $$f(x)=x^4-x^3-\frac{1}{2}x^2-\frac{1}{6}x+\frac{1}{24},$$ then they satisfy all the initial conditions and we also have $P_5=\frac{139}{24}$. But what this proves is that there exist $a,b,c,d$ such that the initial conditions are satisfied and $P_5=\frac{139}{24}$. This alone does not prove that this is the only possible value of $P_5$. How to prove that it is, generally? (It might be possible to find the value using only interesting kinds of factorization identities, which would show that the value is unique, but such strategy would not be as general as the Newton sums)","['linear-algebra', 'algebra-precalculus', 'roots']"

931413,Using Cauchy's Integral Theorem to evaluate integral?,"I'm going through Stein's Complex Analysis, and I'm a bit confused at one of the classical examples of using Cauchy's theorem to evaluate an integral. The example is: $$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{1-\cos{x}}{x^2}dx = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ The book says (and I'll add my thoughts & questions in bold as they come up): Here we consider the function $f(z) = (1 - e^{iz})/z^2$, and we integrate over the indented semicircle in the upper half-plane positioned on the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below: Why precisely do we consider the function $f(z) = (1-e^{iz})/z^2$? I get that $e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$ and $\cos{z} = (e^{iz}-e^{iz})/2$, but how precisely do we get $f(z) = (1 - e^{iz})/z^2$ from this? Why precisely are we integrating over the indented semicircle in the upper half-plane positioned on the $x$-axis? As a follow-up, are we creating a hole around 0 because the integral cannot be evaluated at x = 0? [back to book] If we denote $\gamma_{\epsilon}^+$ and $\gamma_R^+$ the semicircles of radii $\epsilon$ and $R$ with negative and positive orientations respectively, Cauchy's theorem gives: $$\int_{-R}^{-\epsilon}\frac{1-e^{ix}}{x^2}dx + \int_{\gamma_{\epsilon}^+}\frac{1-e^{iz}}{z^2}dz + \int_{\epsilon}^R\frac{1-e^{ix}}{x^2}dx + \int_{\gamma_R^+}\frac{1-e^{iz}}{z^2}dz = 0$$ First we let $R \rightarrow \infty$ and observe that: $$\mid\frac{1-e^{iz}}{z^2}\mid \ \leq \ \frac{2}{\mid z\mid^2}$$ so the integral over $\gamma_R^+$ goes to 0. Therefore: $$\int_{\mid x \mid \geq \epsilon}\frac{1-e^{ix}}{x^2}dx = -\int_{\gamma_{\epsilon}^+}\frac{1-e^{iz}}{z^2}dz$$ Why does letting $R \rightarrow \infty$ lead to the above inequality? What does $R \rightarrow \infty$ mean in the scope of the diagram, and why does the integral over $\gamma_R^+$ go to zero? Not really sure how the last equality is formulated as well... [back to book] Next, note that: $$f(z) = \frac{iz}{z^2} + E(z)$$ where $E(z)$ is bounded as $z \rightarrow 0$, while on $\gamma_{\epsilon}^+$ we have $z = \epsilon e^{i\theta}$ and $dz = i\epsilon e^{i \theta}d\theta$. Thus, $$\int_{\gamma_{\epsilon}^+}\frac{1 - e^{iz}}{z^2}dz \rightarrow \int_{\pi}{0}(-ii)d\theta = -\pi$$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. Taking real parts then yields: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1-\cos{x}}{x^2}dx = \pi$$ Since the integrand is even, the desired formula is proved. I don't quite follow the first part of this, but I think more importantly, how does solving all of this help us solve the original integral? What exactly am I taking the ""real parts"" of? Sorry, I know it's a lot, but any sort of walkthrough would be appreciated.",['complex-analysis']

931518,"Problem 1, Chapter 3 - A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry - Spivak","There seems to be an error in item (d) of Problem 1, Chapter 3 of Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, 3rd Edition, which I transcribed below. There is something wrong with the definition of the functions $g_{i,j}$. Notice the $f_{i,j}$ functions are defined on $x_{i}(U_{i})\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $p\in M$ therefore the symbol $f_{i,j}(p)$ does not make any sense. The immediate 'correction' would be to replace $f_{i,j}(p)$ with $f_{i,j}(x_{i}(p))$. But it would follow from this new definition that the pseudometric $\rho$ would actually be a metric on M, and then we could not hope to prove the properties we expect from $\rho$, considering the counterexample given in item (a). Can somebody help me to find a proper correction to this error/typo? (Problem 1) : Let M be any set, and $\{(x_i,U_i)\}$ a sequence of one-one functions $x_i:U_i \to \mathbb{R}^N$ with $U_i \subset M$ and $x_i(U_i)$ open in $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that each
  $$x_j\circ x_i^{-1}:x_i(U_i\cap U_j) \to x_j(U_i \cap U_j)$$
  is continuous. It would seem that M ought to have a metric which makes each $U_i$ open and each $x_i$ a homeomorphism. Actually, this is not quite true: (a) Let $M = \mathbb{R} \cup \{\ast\}$, where $\ast \not\in \mathbb{R}$. Let $U_1=\mathbb{R}$ and $x_1:U_1 \to \mathbb{R}$ be the identity, and let $U_2=\mathbb{R}-\{0\} \cup \{\ast\}$, with $x_2:U_2 \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
  $x_2(a)=a, \space a\not=0,\ast$
  $x_2(\ast)=0$ Show that there is no metric on M of the required sort, by showing that every neighbourhood of $0$ would have to intersect every neighbourhood of $\ast$. Nevertheless, we can find on M a pseudometric $\rho$ (a function $\rho: M\times M \to \mathbb{R}$ with all properties for a metric except that $\rho(p,q)$ may be $0$ for $p\not=q$) such that $\rho$ is a metric on each $U_i$ and each $x_i$ is a homeomorphism: (b) If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is open, then there is a sequence $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots$ of open subsets of $A$ such that every open subset of A is a union of certain $A_i$'s. (c) There is a sequence of continuous functions $f_i:A \to [0,1]$ with $support \space f_i \subset A$, which ""separates points and closed sets"": if C is closed and $p \in A-C$, then there is some $f_i$ with $f_i(p) \not\in f_i(A \cap C)$. Hint: First arrange in a sequence all the pairs $(A_i,A_j)$ of part (b) with $\overline{A_i} \subset A_j$. (d) Let $f_{i,j}, j=1,2,3,\dots$ be such a sequence for each open set $x_i(U_i)$. Define $g_{i,j}:M\to [0,1]$ by $g_{i,j}(p) = f_{i,j}(p), \space p \in U_i$ or $g_{i,j}(p) = 0, \space p \not\in U_i$ Arrange all $g_{i,j}$ in a single sequence $G_1,G_2,G_3, \dots$, let $d$ be a bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$, and define $\rho$ on $M$ by: $$\rho(p,q) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^i}d(G_i(p),G_i(q))$$ Show that $\rho$ is the required pseudometric. (e) Suppose that for every $p,q \in M$ there is a $U_i$ and $U_j$ with $p \in U_i$ and $q \in U_j$ and open sets $B_i \subset x_i(U_i)$ and $B_j \subset x_j(U_j)$ so that $p \in x_i^{-1}(B_i)$, $q \in x_j^{-1}(B_j)$, and $x_i^{-1}(B_i) \cap x_j^{-1}(B_j) = \emptyset $.

I want to calculate the expected output length until the word ABCD is obtained; that is, the letters A B C D appearing consecutively in that order. I have referenced this question (Expected Number of Coin Tosses to Get Five Consecutive Heads) , but have found a complexity in our case; when we obtain, say, ABA, then we can't say that the chain resets, since we have the next potentially successful chain already being started. I have tried the approach below, but am not sure if it is completely correct. I would be grateful for assertion that this approach is ok, as well as for any alternative methods to approach this issue. Let e be the expected number of output letters needed to get the target string ABCD.

| if first letter is [BCD] |   e+1   | 3/4  |

|if BCD                 |    4    | 1/64 |
------------------------------------------ The expected length e is equal to the sum of each (Probability)*(Expected Length) product set from the first table, giving
$$
e\, =\, \frac{3}{4}(e+1)\, +\, \frac{1}{8}(e+2)\, +\, \frac{1}{16}(f+1)\, +\, \frac{1}{32}(e+3
)\, +\, \frac{1}{64}(f+2)\, +\, \frac{1}{128}(e+4)\, +\, \frac{1}{256}(f+3)\, +\, \frac{1}{256}(4) \\-----\\

A similar approach for f yields 
$$
f\, =\, \frac{1}{2}(e+2)\, +\, \frac{1}{4}(f+1)\, +\, \frac{1}{8}(e+3)\, +\, \frac{1}{16}(f+2

f\, \, =\, \frac{21}{32}e\, +\, \frac{21}{64}f\, +\, \frac{127}{64} \\\\
43f\, =\, 42e\, +\, 127 \: \: \:  ---(2)
$$
Combining these, we obtain $$
(2)-(1')\Rightarrow f\, =\, -2e\, +\, 765 \: \: \:  ---(3)\\
(3)\rightarrow (1)\Rightarrow 22e = 21(-2e+765)+319 \\
e=256 \\
f=253
$$ So the expected length seems to be 256 letters output. I notice this is exactly what we would expect from the naive approach, from the fact that each letter has a 1 in 4 chance appearing each time, and after any four letters' output, the chance of ABCD appearing is 
$$
\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) ^ 4 = \frac{1}{256} . 
$$
which is slightly worrying, since the question about five consecutive heads has a probability of 1/32, but a differing number of 62 for the expected length. 2014/09/16 addition: After the above, I also calculated the expected length until I obtain either of TWO target strings; I used ABCD and CDBA as my targets, if it matters. The result was not the intuitive 128, but was 136 instead, by methodology similar to that above. Using the answers provided, I will also try to check this result using new tactics proposed in the answers.","['statistics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

    F(g(b)) - F(g(a)) &=  \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x)dx\\
    \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)du &= \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x)dx
    \end{align}$$ Perfectly fine. The problem with this proof is that it uses the fact that $F(g(b))-F(g(a))$ is the same as the integral of a function $f(u)$ from $g(a)$ to $g(b)$ . However, if we just want to find the antiderivative, that's a problem. In [this][1] proof, he says: $$\displaystyle \int f \left({\phi \left({u}\right)}\right) \phi' \left({u}\right) \ \mathrm d u = \int f \left({x}\right) \ \mathrm d x$$ where $x = \phi \left({u}\right)$ I can't accept this.

Not saying that this is not possible, but it requires further theory about integration that is not on the scope of this proof. I realy really can't understand this proof as valid.

Namely, find the Green's function for $$y'' + y = f(x)$$ with boundary conditions: $$y(0) = y(\frac {\pi} {2}) = 0.$$ The defining equation for the Green's function is: $$G''_{xx}(x, s) + G(x, s) = \delta (x-s).$$ There are some subtle aspects related to integration of discontinuous functions which I can't understand clearly. Everything is ok till finding the general solution and applying boundary conditions which yields: $$

G(x, s) = a \cos x, x > s,\\ 
G(x, s) = b \sin x, x < s,

$$ where $a,b$ are unknown coefficients. Now I need to integrate the defining equation from $s-\varepsilon$ to $s+\varepsilon$ and take the limit as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. I should arrive at: $$
\underset{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}{\lim} \left( G'_{x}(x, s)\bigg|_{s+\varepsilon} - G'_{x}(x, s)\bigg|_{s-\varepsilon} \right) = 1
$$ as shown, for example, here on page 6, formula 41: http://young.physics.ucsc.edu/116C/gf.pdf The second term vanished since $G(x, s)$ is continuous by definition. Indeed, it is easy to show using splitting the interval of integration into $[s-\varepsilon, s]$ and $[s, s+\varepsilon]$ and taking the limit. But what to do with $G''_{xx}(x, s)$? The formula above seems like a ""direct"" application of Newton-Leubnitz formula. Although, $G''_{xx}(x, s)$ is discontinuous and there is no such a function which could be an unambiguous antiderivative for it on the entire interval $[s - \varepsilon, s + \varepsilon]$. UPDATE: According to the theorem 3.8 by Nott (1978) ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/2100979 ), the definite integral of $G''_{xx}(x, s)$ can be computed as follows using the fact that  $G'_{x}(x, s)$ is piecewise continuous: $$

932306,Help with financial modelling,"We deal with ""jobs"" - a mini project involving multiple parties, resources and time constraints, etc. Jobs progresses through 4 well defined states from start to end; call them S1, S2, S3 and S4 where S1 is the start of the job and S4 is where we have invoiced the client and the job is closed. Jobs are for different clients, in different regions and run by different people (project managers) within our company. Not every job in state S1 will make it to S4 as the job may be cancelled.  From historical data we can readily determine for each combination of client/region/project manager the probability of getting from S1 to S4, S2 to S4 and S3 to S4. Also the length of time from S1 to S4 may differ for each of these combinations so we also know historical average time to go from S1 to S4, S2 to S4 and S3 to S4. We may have 1000 jobs currently in progress. ie in states S1, S2 or S3.  We need to predict how much money we will be invoicing each week in the future. I don't think is a problem since it is little more than the sum for each future week of  current estimated value of the job x the probability that it will get from its current state to S4 and then apply this to a future invoicing week based on the historical average length of time to go from the current state to S4.  (be sure to call me out if this is flawed) You can imagine that this will produce a nice bar chart that will get senior management all excited. The problem I am facing is that the finance guys (who are actually really smart) would like to have some confidence intervals, margins or error (or standard deviations or the like) that will help them communicate where the numbers are really solid and where they start to become rubbery. I would imagine that the invoicing for the future few weeks where we are going from S3 to S4 should be highly accurate and the margin of error would be very small yet 3 months out I would like to think that the margin of error could be quite large. My problem is I do not know what to even ""google"" to solve this problem.  How do I go from the data that I have available to a margin of error? It is very binary in that a job either makes it to S4 or it doesn't. I remembered the binomial distribution but that does not look appropriate. I started thinking about standard distributions but this does not seem to work each since it does not make sense to have a standard deviation over boolean logic. One suggestion was that if there is a 50% chance of making it to S4, and the job value is $$1000  then apply $500 to the future invoicing week with $500 either side as a margin of error. On the surface this seems sensible but if there is only a 10% chance of making it S4 then would you attribute $100 to the future invoicing week with a + / -$900 margin of error (or maybe +$900 / -$100).  +$900 seems far too high when the probability of getting to S4 is so low and when all of the work in progress is considered the upper bound of the margin of error will be huge and totally unrealistic.

Define a $G_{\delta}$ set to be a countable intersection $\displaystyle \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} U_n$ of open sets. Define a $F_{\sigma}$ set to be a countable union $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}F_n$ of closed sets. Problem Statement Let $E \subset \mathbb{R^d}$. Show that the following are equivalent: $E$ is Lebesgue measurable. $E$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set with a null set removed. $E$ is the union of a $F_{\sigma}$ set and a null set. This is what I have so far: Let $T$ be a $G_{\delta}$ set. By definition, we have $T=\displaystyle \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} T_n$. Using De Morgan's Laws, $E \setminus \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} T_n$ = $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( E \setminus T_n \right)$ which is a closed set since its complement was open, by definition. Therefore, $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( E \setminus T_n \right)$ is a countable union of closed sets which is the definition of a $F_{\sigma}$ set. Although this shows a relationship between the $G_{\delta}$ sets and the $F_{\sigma}$ sets, I don't know how to include the condition of the null set removed or added as well as connect to the Lebesgue measure.

932684,Proof that arithmetic and geometric mean converge,"I need some help with understanding a part of this proof and also writing it up correctly.

I need to show that sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ converges and that ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ have the same limit. I am told to use the monotonic convergence theorem to prove that both sequences converges and I have the following proof: Notice that {$a_n$} is monotonically decreasing while {$b_n$}  is monotonically increasing.  Since {$a_n$}  is bounded above by supremum $a_1$ below by its infimum $b_1$, {$a_n$} according to the monotonic convergence theorem has to converge. Similarly, notice that {$b_n$} is bounded below by infimum $b$ and supremum $a$.  By monotonic convergence theorem {$b_n$} must also converge as well. Next, I am told to show that {$a_n$} and {$b_n$} have the same limit.  In other words, if [$a_n-b_n$] as n tends to infinity must be 0.  For this part, it seems to be the case that one can prove it by just showing that  $a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} \leq (1/2) (a_n - b_n) $.  And I know you can just show this by using the definition of the arithmetic mean, which is  $a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} \leq a_{n+1} - b_n = (1/2) (a_n - b_n)$.  Why is that?

932795,What is needed to make Euclidean spaces isomorphic as groups?,"Consider the abelian groups $G_n=(\mathbb R^n,+)$ for $n\geq1$. Claim: For any $n$ and $m$ the groups $G_n$ and $G_m$ are isomorphic. This claim is true if one assumes the axiom of choice, and I have sketched a proof below.
But this claim seems much weaker than the axiom of choice, which brings me to the following questions: Are there any milder extensions of ZF that make the claim true? If the claim can be proven with some other axioms, what does the proof look like? Are there any known  axioms that make the claim false? Does the claim have any interesting (set-theoretical) corollaries? This claim was also considered in this earlier post, but from a different point of view. A sketchy proof of the claim: $\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb Q}$
The groups $G_n$ are naturally vector spaces over $\Q$.
It is easy to check that the claim is equivalent with $G_n$ and $G_m$ being isomorphic as vector spaces over $\Q$. All vector spaces have a Hamel basis; let the basis of $G_n$ be $B_n$.
Thus $G_n=\Q^{(B_n)}$ (brackets meaning only finitely many nonzero components).
But $|\Q^{(B_n)}|=|B_n|$ since the basis is infinite, so $|B_n|=|G_n|=|\mathbb R|$. There is a bijection between the bases of the vector spaces $G_n$ and $G_m$ since they have the same cardinality.
This gives a linear bijection between them.","['vector-spaces', 'set-theory', 'axioms', 'axiom-of-choice', 'group-theory']"

Thus, it seems on the face of it like there are four natural choices for morphisms of topological spaces (since a topology on $X$ is an element of $P(P(X))$). Why is it that continuous functions are the morphisms we choose and not one of the other four maps? I understand that the theory we get from taking continuous functions as morphisms is incredibly rich and so this alone provides adequate justification.

Through computation I could show this is nonzero in this case, but I haven't found a way to extend this result more generally.

  $$\int z^n\ln{\left(z\right)}\ln{\left(1-z\right)}\,\mathrm{d}z=~???$$ My attempt: Euler's reflection identity for dilogarithms states, $$\ln{\left(z\right)}\ln{\left(1-z\right)}=\zeta{(2)}-\operatorname{Li}_2{\left(z\right)}-\operatorname{Li}_2{\left(1-z\right)}.\tag{1}$$ Using identity $(1)$, our integral may be split up into three integrals, the first of which is elementary: $$\begin{align}
\int z^n\ln{\left(z\right)}\ln{\left(1-z\right)}\,\mathrm{d}z

933209,"Evaluating a series to order ""three halves""","In doing some calculations related to one-dimensional Brownian Motion confined to a finite interval, I have come across functions such as $$
f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\exp(-n^2t)}{n^4}.
$$
  I am interested in the behavior of this function for small $t$. By expanding the exponential it is easy to get the terms of order 0 and 1 in $t$. However, the term of order $t^2$ diverges. I take this to mean that $f(t)$ does not have a second derivative at $t = 0$. I think (although I'm not sure) that in some sense there is a ""3/2"" order term. How does one define and calculate this term? Perhaps the limit
  $$
\lim_{t \to 0}\frac{f(t) - f(0) - t f'(0)}{t^{3/2}}
$$
  is finite and can be calculated? Is there an unambiguous way of expanding such functions in power series with fractional powers? Background :
Consider a particle undergoing one-dimensional Brownian Motion in the interval $\left[0,L\right]$ with reflecting boundary conditions. The particle has diffusion coefficient $D$ and its position is $x(t)$. Its initial position is distributed uniformly in the interval. Then one can show that the mean squared displacement at time $t$ is
$$
\text{MSD}(t) \equiv \langle \left[x(t) - x(0)\right]^2\rangle =  \frac{L^2}{6} + \frac{8 L^2}{\pi^4}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{-1 + (-1)^n}{n^4} \cdot \exp(-t/\tau_n),
$$
where
$$
\tau_n = \frac{L^2}{n^2 \pi^2 D}
$$
As I mentioned, one can calculate this up to first order in $t$. The constant term is of course zero (the particle can't travel any distance in zero time) and the first order term turns out to be $2 D t$, which makes sense since this is the MSD of a free particle (i.e. before it encounters any walls).

933233,Prove Borel Measurable Set A with the following property has measure 0.,"This question is exercise 4.10 of Richard F. Bass's Real Analysis for Graduate Students, 2nd edition. Let $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, let $m$ be Lebesgue measure, and suppose $A$ is Borel Measurable subset of $\mathbb R$. Prove that if $$ m(A\cap I)\leq (1-\epsilon)m(I)$$ for every interval $I$, then $m(A)=0$. Collection of my thoughts 1. Try to prove by contradiction, suppose $m(A)=a>0$ Borel Measurable Set satisfies the condition given. A property of any Borel Measurable Set on $\mathbb R$ is $A$ contains a closed set $F$ and is contained in open set $O$, and the measure of $F$ and $O$ can be arbitrarily close to $a$. 2. Obviously $A$ contains no interval, but it does not lead to contradiction, because we can find an example of $m(A)>0$ that contains no interval(fat Cantor Set(remove middle 1/4 each time) has measure $1/2$ and contains no interval). 2'. For fat Cantor Set $C$ and given $\epsilon>0$ how could we construct an interval I satisfies $m(C \cap I)>(1-\epsilon)m(I) ?$ Maybe try to write Borel measurable set as countable union/intersection of intervals.

The next set of triples can start from one of 48 cards since the last of the first value is dead to the problem, then once again there are 3 then 2 possibilities. I believe that covers all possible hands with double triples. The number of possible hands is 52 choose 6, so 52!/(6!46!). Simplified, that should make the probability equal: (52x48x2x2x3x3)(6!46!)/52! I can't help but feel like I messed something up. Do I need to square the 6! to account for the orders of the hand, something else, or is my answer correct?","['statistics', 'probability']"
