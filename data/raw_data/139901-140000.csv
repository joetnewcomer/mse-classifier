2252215,When is the canonical sheaf of a curve very ample?,"Let $X/k$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of genus $g$, then when is it that the canonical sheaf $\omega_X$ is very ample, i.e. $\omega_X = i^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(1)$ for some closed immersion $i:X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$? My intuition is that this is true for any $g\gg0$, and probably for something like $g\ge 2$ or $g\ge 3$, but I don't immediately see how to prove this.

2252247,A circle is drawn on one side of a triangle. Prove the radius of that circle.,"Question: In $\triangle ABC$, $\angle C = θ$, $|CB| = a$ and $|CA| = b$. The semi-circle with the diameter lying on the side $[AB]$ touches the side $[CA]$ and the side $[CB]$. Prove the radius of the semi-circle is equal to $$\dfrac{ab\cdot \sin θ}{a+b}$$ I found that $c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos θ}$, but I am not sure where to go on from there. The cosine formula gives you c using cosine, but the number given in the question uses sine.","['circles', 'trigonometry', 'triangles', 'geometry']"
2252256,Applications of matrix Chernoff bounds,"The Chernoff bound, being a sharp quantitative version of the law of large numbers, is incredibly useful in many contexts. Some general applications that come to mind (which I guess are really the same idea) are: bounding the sample complexity of PAC algorithms; estimating confidence intervals for polling (somewhat surprisingly, the Chernoff bound tells you that if you want to poll a population of $N$ people, the number $N$ doesn't really matter for the tradeoff between randomly sampled people and accuracy of the empirical average) more generally, very often in the analysis of randomized algorithms you need to argue that you have 'enough' samples, and Chernoff bounds are the way to go. By now I feel like I have a good intuitive grasp of the power and limitations of Chernoff bounds. Basically, my question is about getting a similar understanding of matrix Chernoff bounds: How do I obtain a similar palette of 'classical' applications of matrix Chernoff bounds? What are some of the nice proofs they give us? Have they substantially simplified previous work that didn't explicitly use them?","['big-list', 'random-matrices', 'concentration-of-measure', 'probability', 'linear-algebra']"

My question is, is there an easier way to find the determinant of this specific matrix, or, once the determinant is found, to multiply out the result to find the polynomial? The only methods I have been taught have been to either try to find or create a row with several 0's to make the cofactor expansion easier, or to get an upper or lower triangular matrix, however, those seem equally as messy here.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

The formula for an infinite arithmetic sum is $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=\frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2},$$ so if you want to find the sum of the natural numbers from $1$ to $n$, this equation becomes $$\frac{n^2+n}{2},$$ and the roots of this quadratic are at $n=-1$ and $0$. What I find really interesting is that $$\int_{-1}^0 \frac{n^2+n}{2}dn=-\frac{1}{12}$$ There are a lot of people who claim that the sum of all natural numbers is $-\frac{1}{12}$, so I was wondering if this result is a complete coincidence or if there's something else to glean from it.","['summation', 'integration', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

2252690,How to prove two cross ratios on a triangle are equal using collinearity (Geometry for College Students 3C.2),"I'm trying to solve two related problems, 3C.2 and 3C.3, for a homework assignment but find myself stuck. They are from the 2nd edition Geometry for College Students by Martin Isaacs. Since they include a diagram I included a picture. The problems are as follows with the relevant hint that it gives below: 3C.2 and 3C.3 My textbook defines cross ratio for four points as $cr(A,B,C,D)=\frac{AC\cdot BD}{AD\cdot BC}$ and defines $cr(A,B,C,D)=cr(W,X,Y,Z)$ when the lines AW, BX, CY, and DZ all meet at single point. For what I've tried, I started with 3C.2 using the definition of cross ratios. But not matter what I tried and how I played the the triangle, I could not figure out how to get $\frac{AZ\cdot YC}{AC\cdot YZ}=\frac{AX\cdot WB}{AB\cdot WX}$ I realized that it might be better to see if WY, XZ, and BC meet at a single point and use that to show that $cr(A,Y,Z,C)=cr(A, W, X, B)$ . After drawing it out I realized that they did all meet at a point. It was then that I realized that I'd created the conditions for 3C.3. I thought if I was able to prove that 3C.3 I could then use it to prove 3C.2. However this is where I get stuck. I felt that if I used the hint, I can do two smaller proofs. In one I can assume $T=C$ and get the correct solution rather easily. Then I could do $T \neq C$ and look for a contradiction. Visually if $T\neq C$ , then R is not on BC, and A, P, and Q are no longer all collinear so I have a contradiction with the problem setup. However I can only draw a picture of this for a single case, which is not a proof! Even though I can see why the statement in both problems is true, I am stuck on turning it into a formal proof.","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"
2252702,"What do the ""real"" and ""imaginary"" parts of the Laplace and Z transform represent?","I've been able to wrap my head around the continuous and discrete Fourier transform just fine.

So if the imaginary portion, $\omega$, is the frequency, what does the real $\sigma$ represent? Furthermore, why is it not like this between the DTFT and the Z transform?

2252703,Functions involving expectations - The dominated/monotone convergence theorem,"Let $F:[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ be a continuous function, $X$ and $Y$ two non-negative random variables on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$, and $$\mathbb{E}\big[\; F(X+Y) \;\big]<\infty$$ I am interested in the function $$H(y)=\mathbb{E}\big[\; F(X+y) \;\big]$$ where $y\in[0,\infty)$. Is this function continuous? Is it continuous on some set $A\subset[0,\infty)$? Intuitively, the random variable $F(X + y)$ is bounded on some (compact) set given by the random variable $Y$ and this should work. If I understand corretly, those kind of continuity questions are usually answered via the dominated or monotone convergence theorem for Lebesgue integrals. For example: given $y\in[0,\infty)$, we may take $y_{n}\rightarrow y$ and set $Z_{n}=F(X+y_{n})$, such that $Z_{n}\rightarrow Z=F(X+y)$. For dominated convergence however, we would need the $Z_{n}$ to be bounded by some integrable random variable. Can anybody point me in the right direction or get me started?

2252709,How to factor polynomials like $x^4-x^2-1$ and $x^4-2x^2-1$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$?,"When it comes to polynomials whose zeros are $n^{th}$ roots of irrational quadratic integers (mainly units), like the above examples, what is the general method in determining the degree of each irreducible factor in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$? All outside a list of finitely many primes $p$ of course. I chose these two specific ones for two reasons; 1). The Galois group of the polynomials $f(X)=X^4-X^2-1$ and $g(X)=X^4-2X^2-1$ are not abelian, unlike the $h(X)=X^4-4X^2+1$ whose roots are $$\pm\sqrt{2\pm\sqrt{3}}=\pm\frac{1\pm\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}$$ alluding to quadratic reciprocity. And adjoining a root of $f$ or $g$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ isn't of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{n})$. 2) I had tried doing so without success and forgot until I came back, after learning some reciprocity, and was able to remember on the off chance a way to do so for these two specific cases. For an example computation, the zeros of $f(X)$ are $$\pm\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}, \pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}.$$ Determining the action of the map $T_{p}: r \mapsto r^{p} \pmod{p}$ for $$r \in \left\{\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}, -\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}, -\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right\}$$ an ordered set can be worked with by knowing properties of the quartic residue symbol 
$$\Big[\frac{5}{p}\Big]_{4}=5^{\frac{p-1}{4}} \pmod{p}$$
and that
$$\sin\frac{2\pi}{5}=\sqrt{\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}}=\frac{\sqrt[4]{5}}{2}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}.$$ From there, it becomes a lot easier to factor in because the action of $T_{p}$ is straightforward with the minimal polynomial of $\sin\frac{2\pi}{5}$, and the action is relatively accessible with the residue symbol. The same goes for determining the action of $T_{p}$ for $g(X)$ by considering quartic residue symbol $\left[\dfrac{2}{p}\right]_{4}$ and $\cos\dfrac{\pi}{8}=\dfrac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}{2}$. But this approach feels too ad hoc, and doesn't say anything about how to factor anything like, for example, $\displaystyle f(X^n)$ in general. What kind of tools are used to find how $h(X^{3})$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$? $h(X^{\frac{3}{2}})$? Also, phrased using the language of fields, this raises the question of when the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{q})$ is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ for $q$ an irrational square-free quadratic integer","['finite-fields', 'polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

2252769,"If $X$ is Hausdorff and the quotient map $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed, must $\sim$ be closed in $X\times X$?","Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a Hausdorff space $X$ . Let $X/\mathord{\sim}$ be the corresponding quotient space. Assume that the quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed. Question: Is $\sim$ necessarily a closed subset of $X\times X$ ? Let us note that the elements of $X/\mathord{\sim}$ are the equivalence classes, and the topology of $X/\mathord{\sim}$ consists of all sets $\mathcal{U}\subseteq X/{\mathord{\sim}}$ such that $\bigcup\mathcal{U}$ is an open subset of $X$ .
The quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ assigns to each $x$ its corresponding equivalence class $[x]$ . We show that if the answer is 'no' then the example must be a non-regular space $X$ and an equivalence $\sim$ must be such that $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is not Hausdorff. We denote by $[A]$ the saturation of set $A\subseteq X$ with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$ , that is, $[A]=\{x\in X\colon (\exists y\in A)\,x\sim y\}$ . Proposition: Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$ such that the quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed and $\sim$ is not closed in $X\times X$ .
Then $X$ is not regular and $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is not Hausdorff. Proof: The second part follows easily since if $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is Hausdorff then its diagonal $D=\{([x],[x])\colon\,x\in X\}$ is closed in $(X/\mathord{\sim})\times(X/\mathord{\sim})$ and $\sim$ is the preimage of $D$ under continuous mapping $q\times q\colon (x,y)\mapsto([x],[y])$ , hence $\sim$ is closed in $X\times X$ . To show the first part, assume that $X$ is regular, $q$ is a closed map and $\sim$ is not closed in $X\times X$ . Then $[x]$ is closed for every $x$ . There exist $u,v\in X$ such that $u\nsim v$ but for every neighbourhood $W\subseteq X\times X$ of $(u,v)$ there exists $(u_W,v_W)\in W$ such that $u_W\sim v_W$ . We have $u\notin [v]$ and $v\notin [u]$ hence by regularity of $X$ there exist open sets $U_0,U_1,V_0,V_1$ such that $u\in U_0$ , $v\in V_0$ , $[u]\subseteq U_1$ , $[v]\subseteq V_1$ , and $U_0\cap V_1=U_1\cap V_0=\emptyset$ . Denote by $\mathcal{W}$ the family of all open sets $W\subseteq U_0\times V_0$ containing $(u,v)$ , and let $A=\{u_W\colon W\in\mathcal{W}\}$ , $B=\{v_W\colon W\in\mathcal{W}\}$ . Then $u\in\mathrm{cl}{A}$ , $v\in\mathrm{cl}{B}$ , and $[A]=[B]$ . Since $A\subseteq U_0$ and $B\subseteq V_0$ , we have $A\cap [v]=B\cap [u]=\emptyset$ , hence $u,v\notin [A]=[B]$ . Since $q$ is a closed map, sets $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]$ , $[\mathrm{cl}{B}]$ are closed, hence $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]\supseteq\mathrm{cl}[A]=\mathrm{cl}[B]\supseteq \mathrm{cl}{B}$ , similarly also $[\mathrm{cl}{B}]\supseteq\mathrm{cl}{A}$ , hence $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]=[\mathrm{cl}{B}]$ . It follows that there exist $u'\in\mathrm{cl}{A}$ and $v'\in\mathrm{cl}{B}$ such that $u'\sim v$ and $u\sim v'$ , hence $u'\in [v]\subseteq V_1$ . But we have $\mathrm{cl}{A}\cap V_1=\emptyset$ , a contradiction. q.e.d. Note 1: This question was originally entitled A closed quotient mapping such that the corresponding equivalence is not closed . The question was completely rewritten but remains equivalent. Note 2: This question was mentioned in the comments to another question: When is a quotient by closed equivalence relation Hausdorff . Note 3: Exercise 2.4.c (a) in Engelking's General Topology (1989) asks to find a topological space $X$ (without the requirement of Hausdorffness) and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$ such that the quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed but $\sim$ is not a closed subset of $X\times X$ .
There is no hint to the exercise. Note 4: A closely related question is the following: Is the image of a Hausdorff space under a closed continuous mapping necessarily Hausdorff ? If this is true then we have also a positive answer to the original question. If the answer is 'no' and there exists a closed continuous surjection $f$ from a Hausdorff space $X$ onto a non-Hausdorff space $Y$ then this surjection is necessarily a quotient mapping, but it is not clear whether the equivalence relation $\sim$ defined by $x\sim y$ iff $f(x)=f(y)$ must be a closed subset of $X\times X$ .","['general-topology', 'equivalence-relations', 'quotient-spaces']"

For example, imaginary part in the region $0 < k < 1$ is zero, while in the region $1 < z < \infty$ it is non-zero with non-trivial functional dependence, making a jump at $z = 1$. Is this somehow related to general properties of analytical continuation (which in our particular case is given by (2))?","['special-functions', 'complex-analysis', 'elliptic-integrals']"

2252941,Inequality constraints in calculus of variations,"$\def\d{\mathrm{d}}$It turns out that Yuri's answer to my earlier question , whilst correct (and I thank him for his effort), was not quite what I desired. I had not posed the question properly, so I have chosen to re-ask as I am still struggling to implement the strict inequality constraints. Let me begin by reposing the question. I wish to extremise 
$$Q = \int_0^h u \, \, \d y$$
subject to the constraints$$
B = B_0,\ M = M_0,$$
where
$$B = \int_0^h ug \, \d y, \ M = \int_0^h \left( u^2 + \int_0^y g(y^*) \, \d y^*\right) \, \d y.$$
An important new difference is that we have that $h$, the upper limit, can vary, and crucially we need $$u(h) = 0, \ g(h) = 0, \\ \int_0^h u \, \d y> 0, \ \int_0^h g \, \d y = G(h) > 0.$$ Here is my attempt (mostly following @Yuri). We set $$ G(y) = \int_0^y g(y^*) \, \d y^*$$ such that $$B = \int_0^h uG' \, \d y, \ M = \int_0^h u^2 + G \, \d y$$ and hence the Lagrangian becomes $$L(u,G,G',\lambda,\mu) = Q + \lambda(B-B_0) + \mu(M-M_0).$$ The variations of this (using Euler-Lagrange $\frac{\partial L}{\partial F} -  \frac{\d}{\d y}\frac{\partial L}{\partial F'} = 0$) become $$1 + \lambda G' + 2\mu u = 0, \ \mu - \lambda u' = 0, \\ \int_0^h uG' = B_0, \ \int_0^h u^2 + G = M_0.$$ The second equation here tells us $$u' = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \Longrightarrow u = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}y + u_0.$$ Now since $h$ can vary we have two further transversality conditions $$\left.\frac{\partial L}{\partial G'}\right|_{y=h} = 0, \ \left.L - G' \frac{\partial L}{\partial G'}\right|_{y=h} = 0.$$ The first transversality condition tells us that $$\lambda u(h) = 0 \Longrightarrow u(h) = -\frac{\lambda}{\mu} \Longrightarrow u = -\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\left(h-y\right).$$ This is great as it satisifes $u(h) = 0$. The second transversality condition tells us (using the first variation equation to give us $G$) that $$\mu G(h) = 0 \Longrightarrow h = \frac{\lambda}{\mu^2}.$$ (However I think this condition violates the requirement $G(h) > 0$) We can now calculate everything we need, $$B_0 = -\frac{1}{6\mu^3}, \ M_0 = \frac{\lambda}{2\mu^4} \\ \lambda = \frac{M_0}{3\left(6^{1/3}B_0^{4/3}\right)}, \ \mu = -\frac{1}{6^{1/3}B_0^{1/3}}, \ h = \frac{2^{1/3}M_0}{3^{2/3}B_0^{2/3}} \\ Q = \frac{M_0}{6^{1/3}B_0^{1/3}}.$$ If we now sub in some values $B_0 = 6, M_0 = 36.5$ I am especially happy with the answer for $Q \approx 11.05, h \approx 6.696$ as it verifies a separate result I have reached. The problem comes with the profile for $g$. If look at the profile for $u$ we have everything behaving as expected. $u(h) = 0$ and $\int_0^h u \, \, dy >0$. However, the issue comes when looking at the profile for $g$. We can immediately see that $g(h) \neq 0$ (strangely $g(h/2) = 0$), and also we have $\int_0^h g \, \d y = 0$ which is not strictly bigger than 0. So my question is, how can I build the machinery for the constraints on $g$ into the Lagrangian. I have read a little online about possibly using slack variables, but I am not sure how to implement them. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. Interestingly, if I were to transform the profile of $g$ to $\hat{g}$ such that $g(h/2) = \hat{g}(h) = 0$ and $g(0) = g^*, \hat{g}(0) = g^* / 2$ the solution for $\hat{g}$ would match the separate result I have reached identically. EDIT So I have a found a paper in which the author uses slack variables to impose a condition $\theta_z \geq 0$, my thinking is that this condition is equivalent to $G' >0$. Though in his derivation, his multiplier becomes a function of $z$. Something that I have never seen before. EDIT 2 I am now not convinced the second transversality condition is correct. This condition $G(h) = \int_0^h g = 0$ is what is forcing the profile to be negative above $h/2$ (to keep the area 0). This actually contradicts the essential requirement that $\int_0^h g > 0$. EDIT 3 I thought it would be helpful to add some further motivation. This method of calculus of variations as described above finds two solution profiles for $u$ and $g$ that are given by $$ u_1 = \frac{3 B_0 (h - y)}{M_0} \\ g_1 = \frac{3 \left(6 B_0^2 (h-y)-6^{1/3} B_0^{4/3} M_0\right)}{M_0^2} $$ which we can see satisfy the equations and maximise $Q$. I believe that the true solution I am seeking is given by profiles $$ u_2 = \frac{3 B_0 (h - y)}{M_0}, \ g_2 = \frac{9 B_0^2 (h-y)}{2 M_0^2}, \ h = \frac{2^{1/3}M_0}{3^{2/3}B_0^{2/3}}.$$ which can be shown to satisfy all the equations for $M,B$ and also give the same maximal $Q$. Furthermore, the profile for $g_2$ in particular satisfies the requirements that $g_2(h) = 0$ and $\int_0^h g_2 > 0$. It would appear to me that the $g_1, g_2$ profiles are equivalent solutions and I would expect that the calculus of variations to find both? I find it confusing that it doesn't. I suppose one could frame the question in the way. What constraints needed to be added to the Lagrangian such that the calculus of variations gives the me the desired $g_2$ profile, rather than the unphysical $g_1$ profile?","['calculus-of-variations', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'calculus']"

2253722,Non-standard measure,"Just a bit of a strange question.  Modern formulations of probability theory rest upon measure theory.  This poses an issue for non-measurable sets.  Typically, one simply excludes these sets from the analysis and considers only measurable subsets of, for example, the real numbers. It can be shown that the following four assumptions cannot all be true: $P_0$ :  If a set has a measure, it is a value $0 \leq x \leq \infty$ in the extended reals. $P_1$ :  If a set $P$ has measure $x$ , then the set $P' = E(P)$ also has measure $x$ , where $E$ represents an arbitrary element of the full Euclidean symmetry group of rotations and translations. $P_2$ :  Measure is a sigma-additive function.  If $P$ and $P'$ are disjoint sets with measures $x$ and $x'$ , respectively, then the measure of $P \cup P'$ is $x + x'$ . $P_3$ :  Every subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a measure. In standard analysis, it is usually $P_3$ which is rejected.  One then does measure theory, and therefore probability theory, with the sigma algebra of measurable subsets.  One then defines the Lebesgue measure as the unique function satisfying all postulates $P_0-P_2$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$ . My question is this.  Is it possible to produce a consistent measure theory with $P_1$ , $P_2$ , and $P_3$ but rejecting $P_0$ ?  In particular, if we let the measure of a set be given, in general, by a non-negative surreal number, would this allow the other axioms to hold?

Let $(-,-)$ be the scalar product induced by the identification of the imaginary octonions with $\Bbb R^7$. Furthermore, define the cross product of (any) octonions by $x\times y:= \frac{1}{2}(xy-yx)$. For imaginary octonions $x,y$, there is the nice identity $x\times y=(x,y)+x\cdot y$, where the dot denotes octonion multiplication. Define the linear map $L_{x,y}:\operatorname{Im}\mathbb O\to \operatorname{Im}\mathbb O$ by $L_{x,y}(v)=x\times (y\times v)$, where $x,y$ are also imaginary quaternions. It is easy to prove by explicit calculation (plugging in a basis) that there is the following identity: $$(x,y)=-\frac{1}{6}\operatorname{tr}L \qquad \qquad x,y\in \operatorname{Im}\mathbb O$$ This identity is useful because it shows that octonion multiplication of imaginary octonions only depends on the cross product, and thereby yields the equivalence of two common definitions of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$. I don't like the brute force proof, so I am left wondering whether there is a better way to see that this identity holds. Is anyone aware of a slick(er) proof?

Consider all possible values on prime numbers not bigger than $\sqrt{n}$. For every other prime we know whether we want to set $-1$ or $1$ on it, because it depends only on sum of values on numbers smaller than $\sqrt{n}$.
So the complexity is $O\left(n 2^{\frac{2\sqrt{n}}{\log{n}}}\right)$. Here are my questions regarding this function: is $F$ always non-positive for $n > 1$? [Edit: Yes, it is] does it reach $0$ infinitely many times? [Edit: No, it doesn't] what is $F$'s asymptotic?

 Then show $\mu(\text{spt}^c) = 0$.

Namely, let $K \subset \text{spt}^c$ be a compact set. Then, for each $x \in K$, there is $N(x)$ open so that $\mu(N(x)) = 0$. By compactness we can find a finite subcover and using subadditivity of an outer measure gives $\mu(K) = 0$ for every compact $K$.

Other way for (3.3): $|G|$ is divisible by $2$ =degree of irreducible character. If $|G|=2.(odd)$ then it is well-known from basic group theory that $G$ can't be simple (Actually it is solvable). So $4$ should divide $|G|$ . Consider subgroup $H$ of order $4$ in $G$ . Let $\mathfrak{X}:G\rightarrow {\rm GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be irreducible with $G$ simple (non-abelian).

2254215,Ways to construct this triangle,"So I was wandering through Wikipedia, as you do, when I stumbled across this beaut: Long story short, this ""triangle of measures"" has been occupying my time for a while now. My goal is this: given only the ratio between any two (straight) named lengths in the diagram, or between any one length and the radius of the relevant circle (the length given as ""1"" in the diagram), construct the entire triangle with straightedge and compass. So far, I've proven the cases with radius and any other length; with any two of sine, versine or chord; with sine and cosine; with sine and tangent; with secant and tangent; with secant and exsecant, and with secant and cosecant. The co-forms are analogous and trivial to prove from these. I have also discovered that given tangent and cotangent I can use a guess-and-adjust construction to find the height necessary to make cot+tan a hypotenuse, and thus the radius, but I can't find a strict straightedge-and-compass construction. I am also aware that it may well be impossible to use certain pairs to construct the whole triangle of measures, but my disproving abilities are far behind my proving abilities. Any proofs or disproofs would be appreciated. Edit I: Thanks to Aretino, I have learned a compass-and-straightedge construction from only cotangent and tangent. This led to an analogous construction from cosine and secant, as well as a guess-and-adjust one for sine and secant (And their analogous co-forms, obviously). Edit II: After some thinking, the guess-and-adjust construction from sine and secant has yielded to the compass and straightedge! First, construct a semicircle with a diameter of the secant. Second, construct a perpendicular anywhere along the line of the secant and mark off the sine along the perpendicular. Third, construct a perpendicular from the free end of the sine on the original perpendicular; call this the parallel. Where the parallel hits the semicircle (provided the semicircle and the sine are on the same side, this will happen twice) will be a possible point for the right angle between tangent and radius. Drop the sine from either point to the secant and then construct the tangent and radius. From there, the rest of the triangle is constructable.","['recreational-mathematics', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"

2254257,Proving a sequence of integrable functions that converges uniformly converges to an Integrable function,"So I have a sequence of riemann (darboux specifically) integrable real valued functions $(f_n)$ defined on $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ that converges uniformly to some $f$. I would like a hint (or two even) on how to show this $f$ is integrable. I split this problem up into two parts, namely first proving that $f$ is bounded, and then later proving that $f$ is integrable. So for the first part I have that: Recall that each $f_n$ is bounded on $[a,b]$, so we have that for each $n$, $f_n([a,b])$ has some supremum in $\mathbb{R}$ (call it $M$) and that:
$$
f_n(x) \leq M \text{ for any $x\in [a,b]$}
$$
A similar statement can be made about the lower bound. Fix some $\epsilon>0$. We know by the uniform convergence of $f_n$ to $f(x)$ that, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with the property that for any $n \geq N$ we have:
$$
|f_n(x) - f(x)|<\epsilon \text{ for all $x\in [a,b]$}
$$
So we see that:
$$
f(x)< f_n(x) + \epsilon \leq M +\epsilon \text{ for all $x\in [a,b]$}
$$ So $f$ is bounded. I am not entirely sure how to proceed from here. I am fairly certain I need to satisfy the Riemann integrability condition, i.e show that for any $\epsilon$ there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that:
$$
U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \epsilon
$$
I have a feeling I need to pick some special epsilons and do some tricky manipulations, but I was hoping for some guidance in the right direction.","['inequality', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'integration', 'sequences-and-series']"

2254422,"For which topologies are the concepts of open and closed ""interchangeable""?","The question as written in the title is too vague to be interpreted meaningfully, so allow me to explain more precisely what I mean. There are at least two equivalent ways of defining a topology: the standard one involves specifying a family of open sets (which satisfy certain axioms), and a dual way involves specifying a family of closed sets (which satisfy certain axioms). A family of open sets (1) is closed under arbitrary union (2) closed under finite intersections (3) the space itself and the empty set are open, while a family of closed sets is (1) closed under arbitrary intersections (2) closed under finite unions (3) the space itself and the empty set are closed. Any family of open sets determines a family of closed sets and vice-versa via set complementation (because of De Morgan's laws). Question: Corresponding to any topology is a family of open sets and a family of closed sets -- I say that they are ""indistinguishable"" if the family of open sets also satisfies the axioms for a family of closed sets (possibly for a different topology), and if the family of closed sets also satisfies the axioms for a family of open sets (possibly for a different topology). Then for which topologies are the concepts of open sets and closed sets ""indistinguishable"" in the sense mentioned above? Attempt: For any such topological space, both the family of open sets and the family of closed sets are closed under arbitrary unions and arbitrary intersections. If we can get either the family of open sets or the family of closed sets to contain all points, then we automatically have the discrete topology on the space. A topological space is T1 if and only if all points in the space are closed. Thus, if the family of closed sets of such a space also satisfies the open set axioms, then it is actually the entire power set of the space, and by DeMorgan's Laws so is the family of open sets of such a space. Thus the topology is the discrete topology. Thus the only T1 topologies for which the concepts of open and closed sets are indistinguishable in the sense given above are the discrete topologies. I claim that it is also possible to have non-T1 topologies for which the concepts of open and closed sets are indistinguishable as mentioned above and yet the topology is not the discrete topology. Moreover, in some cases of these non-T1 topologies the family of open sets and closed sets are strictly different, even though both families satisfy both the open and closed set axioms. The example in mind I have is extremely simple: consider a space $X$, and a non-empty proper subset $Y$. Then $\{ \emptyset, Y, X \}$ satisfies both the open and closed set axioms, as does $\{ \emptyset, Y^c, X \}$. Obviously these topologies are not T1, even in the case that $X$ consists of only two points. Thus the concept of a topology for which the open and closed sets satisfy both the open and closed set axioms is only possibly interesting for non-T1 spaces, for which one is not automatically guaranteed that such topologies are the discrete topology.",['general-topology']

2254539,Conditional joint probability of Gaussian random variables,"Update: I figured out a way to solve this (still some questions remain) The problem basically in all its generalization is: We are given a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ whose entries $w_{ij}$ are independent Gaussian random variables distributed as per $w_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. We are given that the sum of each row $R_i > 0$. i.e., $\sum_{j=1}^{k}w_{ij} = R_i  > 0$ for $1 \le i \le m$. We have to find the probability that the sum of each column $\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_{ij} = C_j > 0$. My method: (after referring Density of Gaussian Random variable conditioned on sum ) We need to calculate (conditioning on row sums is implicit) 
$$P(C_1 > 0)P(C_2 > 0 | C_1> 0)...P(C_k > 0 | C_1, C_2...C_{k-1} > 0)$$
For $P(C_1 > 0)$ we use the linked answer to get $\mu_{C_1} = m\sigma\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k}}$ and $\sigma_{C_1}^2 = m\sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{2}{\pi k}\right)$. Here I have approximated the skew normal distribution with a normal distribution. Now to calculate $P(C_r > 0 | C_1, C_2...C_{r-1} > 0)$ we can first compute the posterior distribution of $w_{ij}$ conditioned on $C_{j} > 0$ as $$w_{ij}|_{C_j > 0} \sim \hat{\mathcal{N}}\left(\sigma\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi m}}, \sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{2}{\pi m}\right)\right)$$
Here I have put a hat showing that I am approximating it by Gaussian. Now the posterior means and variances can be obtained using a truncated normal distribution for $R_i$. However when I try this out and simulate it, the above method is underestimating the actual probability. Whereas if I simply consider the $C_j$'s independent and multiply their individual probabilities then I am little over-estimating but it is coming much closer to the actual answer. Is it possible that the approximation of skewed distribution to normal distribution might be interfering? If so is there a fix to this problem? Thanks I am leaving the old version of the question as it is: I have 6 random variables $X, Y, Z, U, V, W$ all iid distributed as $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Also I am given that $X + Y + Z > 0$ and  $U + V + W > 0$. I have to find the probability that $X + U > 0$ and $Y + V > 0$ and $Z + W > 0$. Now if these three random variables $X + U = A, Y + V = B, Z + W = C$ were independent then I could have simply calculated the posterior probabilities of each of these variables as described in the linked answer and then multiplied them together. However I think they are dependent so I have to do something like
$$P(A > 0, B > 0, C > 0) = P(A > 0)P(B>0 | A > 0)P(C>0|A>0,B>0)$$ Now conditional probability of $A > 0$ can be got from the linked answer. Then to calculate $P(B>0 | A > 0)$ I shall have to redo the analysis after considering the posterior probabilities of $X$ and $U$. Am I correct when I say that the random variables are dependent? If so how should I approach this problem? I shall be grateful if someone can guide me or give me some hints or pointers regarding this.
