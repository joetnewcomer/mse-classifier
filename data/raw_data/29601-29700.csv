275768,Pullback of very ample sheaf again very ample? And other questions.,"Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ be a smooth projective surface with given embedding in projective space. Moreover, let $X$ be another smooth surface and let there be a map $\pi: X \rightarrow S$ that is finite of degree 2. So if we count multiplicities, every point in $S$ has two preimages in $X$. Question 1: Is the sheaf $\pi^*(\mathcal{O}_S(1))$ again very ample? Alternatively, if we denote by $H$ a hyperplane section on $S$, is the pullback divisor $\pi^*H$ on $X$ again a hyperplane section of some embedding of $X$ in some projective space? Question 1(b): If this is not true, can you give a counterexample? Question 2: If this is not true, would it be true if we replace $\mathcal{O}_S(1)$ by $\mathcal{O}_S(k)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$? If necessary, everything can be over $\mathbb{C}$. I think a part of my confusion arises from the following: Hartshorne defines the Serre sheaf of some $\operatorname{Proj}(T)$, but this depends on the graded ring $T$. Question 3: Is it true that being able to write a projective variety as the $\operatorname{Proj}$ of some ring is equivalent by having an explicit embedding in some projective space? Then, is it true that without a given embedding in projective space of some projective variety $X$, the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ is not even defined? As you can tell, i am struggling with the concepts of twisting sheaf, hyperplane sections and projective embeddings. So any elaboration on these concepts would be immensely appreciated, even if it does not contain an answer to the above questions.

275850,"How to compute $H^1(\Bbb P^1,\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb P^1})$ and $H^1(\Bbb P^1,\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb P^1}(n))$","Let $\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb P^1}$ be the structure sheaf of the projective line $X=\Bbb P^1_k$ over some field $k$ (algebraically closed of characteristic $0$). What is a good (and, preferably, easy) way to compute the cohomology group $H^1(\Bbb P^1,\mathcal{O}_X)$? I thought about taking the affine open cover consisting of $U_0=\{x_0\neq 0\}$ and $U_1=\{x_1\neq 0\}$ and using the exact skyscraper sequence
$$0\to\mathcal{O}_X(-1)\to\mathcal{O}_X\to k_p\to 0,$$
where $p=(1:0)$. Here $\varphi\in\mathcal{O}_X(-1)(U)$ is mapped to $x_0\varphi\in\mathcal{O}_X(U)$, while $\mathcal{O}_X(U_0)\ni\psi\mapsto \psi(p)\in k_p(U_0)=k$. Then we get a long exact cohomology sequence
$$0\to \Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X(-1))\to\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X)\to\Gamma(k_p)\to H^1(\mathcal{O}_X(-1))\to H^1(\mathcal{O}_X)\to H^1(k_p)\to 0.$$
Using $\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X(-1))=0$, $\Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X)=k=\Gamma(k_p)$, and $H^1(k_p)$ should be zero, too, since by definition $C^1(k_p)=\prod_{i<j}k_p(U_i\cap U_j)=k_p(U_0\cap U_1)=0$. This simplifies the sequence a bit, but I don't know how to proceed from here. Is there another way to compute the cohomology group (which should be $0$), maybe even without the long exact sequence? If yes, I could maybe use this to also prove $H^1(\Bbb P^1,\mathcal{O}_X(n))=\{x_0^ix_1^j:i+j=n,i<0,j<0\}$.

$$ Experiment 2, $r=0,s=1$: same setup as before, but now I need to obtain $\textit{exactly}$ one more $H$ coin as a result of the experiment (or $T$, it does not matter by symmetry). To do this, I need to flip $exactly$ one more $T$ than $H$, hence we need to flip an $odd$ number of coins: $$
h_{0,1}= \lim _{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} P(0;1;k) \frac{1}{n^{2k+1}} \bigg(1-\frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n-2k-1} \approx 0.208912
$$ Experiment 3, $r=1,s=0$. This comes directly after experiment 2: we have $\frac{n}{2}+1 \ H$ and $\frac{n}{2}-1 \ T$. We want the same result as in Experiment 1: maintain the current proportion of $H$ and $T$ (i.e. flip an even number of coins), but clearly this time around the upper bound on the summation is $\frac{n}{2}-1$. $$
h_{1,0}= \lim _{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} P(1;0;k) \frac{1}{n^{2k}} \bigg(1-\frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n-2k} \approx 0.465225
$$ and so on for $h_{r,s}, 0 \leq r,s \leq n$. So here is what I'd like to know: 1) Have these numbers arisen in some other context (I never ended up publishing a paper) 2) Is there some rigorous way to prove these numbers are irrational? I've shown the $\lim$ part simply by taking large $n$, so I guess this not rigorous enough. 3) If there is something I've missed, I'd like to know too.

276064,Behavior of differential equation as argument goes to zero,"I'm trying to solve a coupled set of ODEs, but before attempting the full numerical solution, I would like to get an idea of what the solution looks like around the origin. The equation at hand is: $$ y''_l - (f'+g')y'_l  + \biggr[ \frac{2-l^2-l}{x^2}e^{2f}  - \frac{2}{x}(f'+g') - \frac{2}{x^2} \biggr]y_l = \frac{4}{x}(f'+g')z_l$$ $y,f,g,z$ are all functions of $x$, which has the domain ($0, X_0$). If I specifically take the $l=2$ case I of course have $$ y''_2 - (f'+g')y'_2  + \biggr[ \frac{-4}{x^2}e^{2f}  - \frac{2}{x}(f'+g') - \frac{2}{x^2} \biggr]y_2 = \frac{4}{x}(f'+g')z_2$$ To avoid issues with singularities, I multiply both sides of the equation by $x^2$, to get, lets call it EQ1. $$ x^2 y''_2 - x^2(f'+g')y'_2  + \biggr[ -4e^{2f}  - x(f'+g') - 2 \biggr]y_2 = 4 x(f'+g')z_2$$ Now if by some magic I know by that as $x \rightarrow 0$, $y_l = x^{l+1}$ so that $y_2 = x^3$. How would I determine what the functions $z_2$ is around the origin? Actually I already know the answer: $z_2$ should also go as $x^3$, but I have not been able to show it. Any help is much appreciated. My attempt at a solution: I have tried to keep things general so I expand $f[x] = 1 + f_1 x + f_2 x^2 +f_3 x^3$, and similarly $g[x] = 1 + g_1 x + g_2 x^2 +g_3 x^3$ where $f_1,f_2,f_3, g_1,g_2,g_3$ are constants. I have kept up to third order because I want to substitute $y_2 = x^3$, so I figured I should take the other functions to that order as well. As for the $e^{2f}$ term, I use a truncated Taylor series for the exponential, $1+\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!}$, into which I substitue my expansion of $f[x]$. After expanding everything out and eliminating terms of higher order than $x^3$ from the right hand side of EQ1, I get something like $constant*x^3$, while the left hand side is third order polynomial times $z_2$. I really just don't know how to proceed. Should I have left higher order terms in the RHS, so that I could divide by a third order polynomial and still end up with $z_2 \propto x^3$. I don't know how this would work because on the RHS I had terms has high as $x^{12}$.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'taylor-expansion']"

276174,"Who conjectured that there are only finitely many biplanes, and why?","This question on MathOverflow motivates me to ask what the reasoning is behind the conjecture that there are only finitely many biplanes.  More generally, it has been conjectured that for fixed $\lambda>1$ there are only finitely many triples $(v,k,\lambda)$ such that a symmetric balanced incomplete block design with these parameters exists. My understanding is that prior to the proof that there is no projective plane of order 10, there was some hope that the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla condition would prove to be sufficient for the existence of a design.  Yet by that time the finitely-many-biplanes conjecture was already in wide circulation.  Since there are infinitely many triples $(v,k,2)$ that satisfy the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla condition, it appears that the design-theory community was able to entertain two conjectures that are not merely incompatible, but starkly opposed. Is anyone aware of any of the history behind this? Elaboration (added later): If we think about families of symmetric designs, with $v$ regarded as a parameter and $\lambda$ some function of $v$ (which would make $k$ a function of $v$ as well), then we can talk about ""large-$\lambda$"" designs, where $\lim_{v\to\infty}\frac{\lambda}{v}=\frac{1}{4}$, and ""small-$\lambda$"" designs, where $\lim_{v\to\infty}\frac{\lambda}{v}=0$.  (Of course there are other possibilities.)  Constant $\lambda$, of course, fits into the ""small-$\lambda$"" case. There is considerable optimism about ""large-$\lambda$"" designs.  The Hadamard conjecture, for example, would imply that a $(4n-1, 2n-1, n-1)$ exists for every $n$.  I think people have conjectured something similar for Menon designs (parameters $(4u^2, 2u^2-u, u^2-u)$), and that most people would make the same conjecture for designs with parameters $(2a^2+2a+1,a^2,a(a-1)/2)$, for which an infinite family is known. Since my experience is mostly with the ""large-$\lambda$"" case, I'm curious about the reasons for the extreme pessimism in the ""small-$\lambda$"" case.","['combinatorial-designs', 'math-history', 'combinatorics']"

For an example the function $y=\sin{\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)}$, is one that I have to put on this graph.  My first idea was as the sine function has a period of $2\pi$ and $T$ is the given period of $y$ that I could cancel the two periods leaving just $\sin{(t)}$ but after more thought I do not really think this is correct as it is not given that $2\pi=T$.  After this I am not really sure how to further work the problem out. I would like to know how to visualise or workout how parameters inside a trig function affect the behaviour of the function. EDIT: I do not understand how to calculate the period of the function given above, I am confused because I understand the period of the function to be given by the coefficient of in this case $t$ as $t$ is multiplied by $2\pi$ and $\frac{1}{T}$ I am not sure which one I would use to calculate the period or both of them?

But how would I do this elimination manually (without Mathematica). I'm hoping that there is some fairly simple mechanical process that I can express in a few hundred lines of C code. I realize that general elimination procedures are pretty complex, but this sort of problem looks quite special and therefore easier (I hope). Roughly speaking, it's just a system of ""linear"" equations in the variables $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$, and $z$. Is there some sort of diagonalization process that can be applied, for example ? Edit:
From the proposed answer below, I see that things can be simplified by setting $p=3x+3y$ and $q = 3x-y$. Then the equations become: $$p^2 = 32 + 256z$$
$$pq = 8 + 376z$$

Given the second point I make below, the perspective seems to be a little inconsistent. Firstly, sure, you can't just integrate over these kind of forms in a direct way, but it's still a reasonable vector of the exteriour algebra. Is it that you can, maybe by means of linear algebra, just a priori say that all results you might have about these objects decompose into the direct sum of the seperate results? But moreover, general cohomology theory theory is concerned with different operators $\mathbb{d}_i$ from space to space. In deRham cohomology, which is I think the primary motivation, one doesn't really seperate the different $\mathbb{d}_i$'s going from 1-forms to 2-forms and 2-formsto 3-forms, notationally. And well, in fact even if you formally introduce different $\mathbb{d}_i$'s, you could then just use them to define the action of one big $\mathbb{d}_i$ in the direct sum space, via the action of the small $\mathbb{d}_i$'s.

276448,Simulation of a Gaussian process on $R^2$ with a stationary kernel using the Karhunen-Loève expansion,"Assume $X(\omega, t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, K(\cdot, \cdot))$ is a real-valued, centered Gaussian process on $R^2$, i.e. , $X: \Omega \times R^2 \to R$. Let the covariance function of the process be stationary, i.e. , $K(t, s) = K(t - s)$, $\forall t, s \in R^2$. More specifically, let it be exponential: $K(t, s) = \exp(-\|t - s\|/L)$ where $\|\cdot\|$ stands for the Euclidean distance, and $L$ denotes the correlation length. Using the Karhunen-Loève expansion, $X$ can be represented as the following summation: $X(t, \omega) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \sqrt{\lambda_i} \phi_i(t) \xi_i(\omega)$ where $\xi_i$ are independent, standard Gaussians, and $\phi_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the covariance function $K$, which, in our case, can be computed analytically. For practical computations, the expansion above is truncated to keep, say, $n$ terms. The question is: How to draw samples of the process on $R^2$, i.e. , on a two-dimensional grid of fixed points, using the first $n$ eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $K$? The problem is that the eigenfunctions are somewhat one-dimensional, and I cannot figure out how to properly use them to get realizations of $X$ on a plane. To be honest, the analytical solution that I claimed previously was initially obtained for processes on $R$, so I am not even sure that it applies directly to $R^2$. When I plug in the norms of points' coordinates into $\phi_i$, I get radial patterns, which is presumably not correct. Also, it is easy to simulate $X$ by constructing the corresponding covariance matrix for a set of points, which boils down to drawing samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. I am not interested in this approach. I would be very grateful for any ideas. Thank you.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'simulation', 'normal-distribution']"

because $\pi^{-1}_k (E_k) = \text{$\prod_{i    \in I}B_i$,  where
    $B_i=E_i$ for all   $i \neq k$}$. So I was wondering if the two equations for $\mathcal{B}$ are the same? Thanks and regards!","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
276644,Prove that that $U(n)$ is an abelian group.,"Prove that that $U(n)$, which is the set of all numbers relatively prime to $n$ that are greater than or equal to one or less than or equal to $n-1$ is an Abelian group. My thought process: for $a, b \in U(n)$ Associativity:  $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ Identity: $1$ is in the set so $a\cdot 1 = a = 1\cdot a$ Inverse: I'm stuck on how to determine the inverse of the set if it exist. Abelian criteria : $a\cdot b = b\cdot a$ Thanks","['modular-arithmetic', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"
