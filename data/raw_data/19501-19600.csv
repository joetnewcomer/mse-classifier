162835,What is the shortest sequence that contains every permutation of $1..n$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: What is the shortest string that contains all permutations of an alphabet? How can one create a list of numbers so that by taking $n$ consecutive elements from that list, it is possible get every permutation of numbers from 1 to $n$? I'll explain myself: The shortest list that contains every permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2 is:
$$1, 2, 1$$
It contains (1, 2) and (2, 1). With numbers from 1 to 3, it would look like something like this:
$$1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1$$
It contains (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), … Note: I'm not sure that this is the shortest list possible. Is there any way to find the smallest list for numbers from 1 to $n$?",['combinatorics']

After counting $T$, let $T'$ be the number of triangles after selecting a pair of vertices, uniformly at random and then redrawing the edge with the same probability $p$. Are there any asymptotic results in $n$ of $P(T'\mid T)$? If it helps, one can assume that $T$ is chosen to be larger than the expected number of triangles. Moreover, notice that choosing a vertex pair uniformly is equivalent to just fixing two vertices and subsequently redrawing the edge.

162848,Biased alternating random walk on a lattice in 1D,"Let's consider a random walk on a fixed lattice with step size 1 in 1 dimensions. In variation to the broadly discussed basic case, with a probability p the next step will be in the opposite direction of the previous step. The direction of the first step is also chosen randomly with same probability p. In my opinion the result should be identical to an unbiased random walk regardless of p, however experiments in Excel seem to suggest that there is a difference (path looks more jagged; but this could be an artifact of the PRNG used).
If there really is a difference I would like to know how to calculate the expected distance from origin after n steps and passing times. Edit: I had a bug in my formula, now p is changing the look of the graph. With p = 0.5 you have an unbiased random walk, with p = 1 it is completely predictable. Thus my question about traveled distance and passing times / passing probabilities has some eligibility.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'random-walk']"

162861,Direct limit of localizations of a ring at elements not in a prime ideal,"For a prime ideal $P$ of a commutative ring $A$, consider the direct limit of the family of localizations $A_f$ indexed by the set $A \setminus P$ with partial order $\le$ such that $f \le g$ iff $V(f) \subseteq V(g)$.  (We have for such $f \le g$ a natural homomorphism $A_f \to A_g$.)  I want to show that this direct limit, $\varinjlim_{f \not\in P} A_f$, is isomorphic to the localization $A_P$ of $A$ at $P$.  For this I consider the homomorphism $\phi$ that maps an equivalence class $[(f, a/f^n)] \mapsto a/f^n$.  (I denote elements of the disjoint union $\sqcup_{f \not\in P} A_f$ by tuples $(f, a/f^n)$.)  Surjectivity is clear, because for any $a/s \in A_P$ with $s \not\in P$, we have the class $[(s, a/s)] \in \varinjlim_{f \not\in P} A_f$ whose image is $a/s$.  For injectivity, suppose we have a class $[(f, a/f^n)]$ whose image $a/f^n = 0/1 \in A_P$.  Then there exists $t \notin P$ such that $ta = 0$.  We want to show that $[(f, a/f^n)]] = [(f, 0/1)]$, which I believe is equivalent to finding a $g \notin P$ such that $V(f) \subseteq V(g)$ and $g^ka = 0$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.  Well, $t$ seems to almost work, but I couldn’t prove that $V(f) \subseteq V(t)$, so maybe we need a different $g$?  Or am I using the wrong map entirely?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
162867,When is the closure of a path connected set also path connected?,"What are the most general criteria we can impose on a locally path connected Hausdorff space $X$ and a path connected subset $A$ such that $\overline{A}$ is path connected? Do more restrictions need to be imposed on $X$ or $A$? For instance, I know that if $\overline{A}$ is locally path connected then $\overline{A}$ is path connected; for all $x \in \overline{A}$ and some neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is open in $\overline{A}$, there must be some path connected neighborhood $U' \subseteq U$ of $x$ that is open in $\overline{A}$. That is, there is some open subset $V'$ of $X$ such that $U' = V' \cap \overline{A}$. Since $x$ is a point of closure of $A$, $V'$ must contain some point $x' \in A \subseteq \overline{A}$, i.e. $x' \in U'$, so $x$ is path connected to $x'$ and hence also to $A$. This holds for all $x \in \overline{A}$ so $\overline{A}$ is path connected. However, the tough part is proving that $\overline{A}$ is locally path connected, because $\overline{A}$ is probably (?) not open in $X$. I'm a complete novice so the only useful thing I know from browsing definitions is that all open subsets of a locally path connected space inherit the local path connectivity. Are there more ways to prove that a subspace inherits local path connectedness? This is more specific, but would it help if I knew that $A$ was the set difference of two closed sets (i.e. the intersection of a closed set and an open set)? I've been looking at stronger restrictions such as $X$ being locally simply connected , but the online documentation is scarce. Would local simple connectivity be ""inherited more easily"" by subspaces?","['general-topology', 'path-connected']"

For example, the standard definition of an topology on a set $X$ requires that arbitrary unions of open sets are open.

162919,Image of a boundary under a continuous function.,"Let $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function bijective on an open and bounded set $\Omega$. If $f$ maps $\Omega$ to itself, that is $f(\Omega)\subseteq \Omega$ then is it necessarily true that $f$ maps the boundary of $\Omega$ to itself? The condition that $f$ is bijective is clearly necessary, since we can take $f$ to be a constant function defined on $\Omega$ otherwise. Given that $f$ is bijective and continuous, does it necessarily have to map the boundary to itself? If not, are there sufficient smoothness conditions (holomorphic?) we can impose to make it true? I realize that we may need the boundary of $\Omega$ to be smooth also, feel free to impose any kind of restrictions to make the question well defined. Edit: By bijection on $\Omega$, I mean that the function satifies

The boundary condition is $G(1,x,\lambda) = 1$. This equation has the solution $G(p;x,\lambda) = \frac{x(1+\lambda) - (1-\lambda)p^{-\frac{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}{2x \lambda}}}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}.$ Solving $G(p;x,\lambda) = 0$, one can find its lower bound $\underline{p} = \left(\frac{1-\lambda}{x(1+\lambda)}\right)^{\frac{2\lambda x}{(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}}$. Define $C_1(x) := \int_{\underline{p}}^{1} (1+\lambda) G(p;x,\lambda) - G(p;x,\lambda)^2 dp$ and $C_2(x) := \lambda + (1-\lambda) \int_{\underline{p}}^{1} G(p;x,\lambda)^2 dp$. One can show that both $C_1(x)$ and $C_2(x)$ are increasing in $x$. Also, $G(p;x,\lambda)$ is increasing in $x$ (over the relevant range). Moreover, I know that $x C_1(x) + (1-x)C_2(x) = \lambda$. OBJECTIVE: Show that $C_2(x)-C_1(x)$ is decreasing in $x$ over the relevant parameter range. Bonus objective: Show that it is convex (both of these features can be shown numerically). Possibly helpful hint: $C_2(x)-C_1(x)$ can also be expressed as $\frac{1-\lambda}{x} \int_{\underline{p}}^{1} G(p;x,\lambda)^2 dp$. Many thanks in advance for any suggestions that might lead to a proof! EDIT: Actually, the problem doesn't look too hard, but I still cannot solve it. Any clever ideas what to do here? Let $x \in (0,1), \lambda \in (0,1)$. Let $p(x,\lambda) = \left(\frac{(1+\lambda) x}{1-\lambda}\right)^{-\frac{2 \lambda x}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}}$. Show that $\frac{(1-\lambda)(\lambda + x) - x(1+\lambda)^2 p(x,\lambda)}{(1-x)(1-x-\lambda)}$ is strictly decreasing in $x$ [for $x \in (0,1), \lambda \in (0,1)$]. Original post For a couple of days I've been struggling with confirming that
$\frac{\partial S(x)}{\partial x}$, with $$S(x) =  v \dfrac{(1+\lambda)^2 x \left(\dfrac{1-\lambda}{(1+\lambda) x}\right)^{\tfrac{2 \lambda x}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}}-(1-\lambda) (\lambda+x)}{(1-x) [x-(1-\lambda)]}\;
\;,$$ is strictly negative for $\lambda \in (0,1)$, $x \in (0,1)$ [$v>0$ is irrelevant]. I can show this numerically, but a general proof would be desirable. For what it's worth, the derivative of this function can be shown to have the same sign as
$(1-\lambda)\left[1+(1-\lambda) \lambda-2 \lambda x-x^{2^{\vphantom{a}}}\right]+ 
\frac{\Large\left(\frac{(1+\lambda) x}{1-\lambda}\right)^{-\frac{2 \lambda x}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}} \left(\left(1-\lambda^2\right)^2-\left(1-\lambda^2\right)^2 x+(1+\lambda)^2 (-1+\lambda (-3+2 \lambda)) x^2+(1+\lambda)^2 (1+3 \lambda) x^3\right)}{\Large x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}$ $+\dfrac{2 (1-\lambda) \lambda (1+\lambda)^2 (1-x) x \left(\frac{(1+\lambda) x}{1-\lambda}\right)^{-\tfrac{2 \lambda x}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}} [x-(1-\lambda)] \text{Log}\left[\frac{(1+\lambda) x}{1-\lambda}\right]}{[x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)]^2},$ provided that $x \neq 1-\lambda.$ The expression gets much simpler by using the upper bound $Log[z] \leq z-1$ (for the case that $x > 1-\lambda$), but then the sign of the simplified expression unfortunately becomes ambiguous. A possibly simpler representation of $\frac{\partial S(x)}{\partial x}$ can be given by $$(1-\lambda)\int_{\underline{p_G}(x)}^{v} 2 x G(p;x) \frac{\partial G(p;x)}{\partial x} - G(p;x)^2 dp,$$
where 
$$G(p;x) = \frac{x(1+\lambda) - (1-\lambda)\left(\frac{v}{p}\right)^{\tfrac{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}{2x \lambda}}}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)},\quad\underline{p_G}(x) = v \left(\frac{1-\lambda}{x(1+\lambda)}\right)^{\tfrac{2\lambda x}{x(1+\lambda)-(1-\lambda)}},$$ $$G(\underline{p_G}(x);x) = 0,\quad G(v) =1.$$ Moreover, I can show that
$\frac{\partial G(p;x)}{\partial x} \geq 0.$ Any help would be welcome! I will happily include a thanking note to my (economics) research article for suggestions that lead to a solution. EDIT: Two other things that might help: $G(p;x)$ is actually the solution to the differential equation

$$\mathrm{Diff}_{~\mathcal{K}}(M) = \{~\phi \in \mathrm{Diff}(M) : \phi^*(\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{K}~\}.$$ Some special cases are: If $\mathcal{K}$ is a metric, then $\mathrm{Diff}_{~\mathcal{K}}(M)$ is just the isometry group of $\mathcal{K}$. It is well-known that this is a finite-dimensional Lie group. In some cases, this group might even be trivial, consisting of the identity map alone. On the other hand, if $\mathcal{K} = 0$, then $\mathrm{Diff}_{~\mathcal{K}}(M) = \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, which is not a (finite-dimensional) Lie group. The previous example might seem too extravagant, but even if $\mathcal{K}$ is a non-degenerate $2$-form, it might happen that $\mathrm{Diff}_{~\mathcal{K}}(M)$ is still too big to be a (again, finite-dimensional) Lie group. This is what happens with symplectic forms, for instance. These examples show that this group depends quite a bit on conditions we impose on $\mathcal{K}$, and it's not clear to me exactly how this happens, or why.

$$\begin{align*}
gkg^{-1}&=(ab)k(ab)^{-1} &&\text{ (where }a\in A \text{ and } b\in B)\\

I'm about to start writing a semestral work that we need to achieve the Bachelor's degree in our country. But my teacher is not an expert in this particular field so he told me I'll have to prepare it all mainly by myself. :-( During the course of algebra, in part about UFD, PID and Euclidean domains, I found really interesting the structures $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{s}]$ where $s$ is a non-square integer. The properties of norm, irreducible and invertible elements etc. Also their classification as UFD, PID etc. is pretty interesting. My questions are: What should be the topic of my work? I barely know the topic so I don't know if it can be somehow made in one whole topic - not just some chunk of some bigger topic with the unexpected end. I also can't decide whether is it enough / too big / too small topic - there are also other extensions of integers, there are also something called fields of rational numbers which my rings seem to be a part of... What would you recommend to be the content of my work? One chapter should be that basic introduction to $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{s}]$ - properties of the norm, invertible elements, algorithm for finding factorization to irreducible elements etc. Another one can be about classificaton of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{s}]$ as UFD, PID, etc. Some facts seem to be easy - proof that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{5}]$ is not a PID, $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is Euclidean domain... But there are also some unsolved problems so I just want to be sure that I'm not digging into something way above my level. I can also focus on some particular ring, like $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, if there is something specially interesting on it. Any other chapters come into your mind? Literature? There is almost nothing in my language about it. In english I googled some classic books like G. H. Hardy, E. M. Wright: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers or D. S. Dummit, R. M. Foote: Abstract Algebra , both books slightly touching the topic but I would appreciate something (basic / advanced) more focused to study.

Furthermore, let $v$ be a harmonic conjugate of $u$ in $\mathbb{D}$ such that $v(0) = 1$. Find $u(1/2)$ and $v(1/2)$. It's easy to find $u(1/2)$ using the Poisson integral formula:

The definitions are: $D$ - the space of $\textit{cadlag}$ functions on [0,1], $\Lambda$ - the class of strictly increasing, continuous mappings of [0,1] onto itself. For $x,y\in D$ define 
$$d(x,y):=\inf\{\varepsilon>0:\ \exists\lambda\in\Lambda:\ \sup_t|\lambda(t)-t|<\varepsilon \text{ and } \\ \sup_t|x(t)-y(\lambda(t))|<\varepsilon\}.\tag{1}$$

This is what I tried: let $x,y\in D$, $d(x,y)=0$ and $t\in[0,1]$. Now from (1) it follows that there exists a sequence $(z_n)\subset[0,1]$ such that $z_n\to t$ and $y(z_n)\to x(t)$ as $n\to\infty$. If $t$ is a continuity point of $y$, then $y(z_n)\to y(t)$, thus $x(t)=y(t)$. If $y$ has a jump at $t$ and $(z_n)$ has a subsequence $(z_{n_k})$ such that $z_{n_k}\geq t, \forall k$, then $y(z_{n_k})\to x(t)$ and $y(z_{n_k})\to y(t)$, as $k\to\infty$, thus $y(t)=x(t)$. Otherwise, $z_n<t$ for $n$ large enough and $y(z_n)\to y(t-)$, as $n\to\infty$, thus $x(t)=y(t-)$. Now suppose that $y=\mathbf{1}_{[t,1]}$, then $y$ has a jump at $t$ and if $d(x,y)=0$, then $x=\mathbf{1}_{(t,1]}$. But this is a contradiction since $x\neq y$ and $x$ is not $\textit{cadlag}$.
