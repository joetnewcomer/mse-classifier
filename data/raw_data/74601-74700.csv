924177,Distance from point to parabola (quadratic bezier),"I'm trying to draw quadratic bezier curve (as line).
I approximate  quadratic bezier curve as parabola ($y=x^2$), according to this document http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch25.html There, in section ""25.5 Antialiasing"" Loop/Blinn claims that signed distance from point (x,y) to the curve $f$(which is $y=x^2$) is: or: Is this correct? [I read, that it is impossible to have another ""parallel"" bezier curve] I ask this because, if I want to detect distance more than 1-2 pixels, and have a high triangle base/height ratio, than ""distance"" shrinks on the base direction. For example, here is 50px distance from inner side of the curve filled green, all other red (all ok): And this one shrunken (pay attention, that distance on height axis still is correct): Curve drawing in triangle with coordinates (0,0) (0.5,0) (1,1). Which is 1st quadrant.","['geometry', 'bezier-curve']"
924180,Modified Hermite interpolation,"I asked similar questions here and here , but I tried to formulate this
one in a sharper way. Is anyone aware of some literature on polynomial interpolation where we sample the function and its derivatives, but perhaps we sample the derivative at a point where we have not sampled the function? For instance, given a function $f$, suppose we choose a polynomial $p$ of degree at most 3 where 
$$p(a_1)=f(a_1)\\p(a_2)=f(a_2)\\p'(a_3)=f'(a_3)\\p'(a_4)=f'(a_4).$$ Finding such a polynomial $\alpha_3 x^3 + \alpha_2 x^2 + \alpha_1 x + \alpha_0$ is equivalent to solving 
$$\left[
\begin{matrix}
1&a_1 & a_1^2 & a_1^3\\
1&a_2 & a_2^2 & a_2^3\\
0&1 & 2a_3 & 3a_3^2\\
0&1 & 2a_4 & 3a_4^2
\end{matrix}
\right]
\left[
\begin{matrix}
\alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2 \\ \alpha_3
\end{matrix}
\right] = 
\left[
\begin{matrix}
f(a_1) \\ f(a_2) \\ f'(a_3) \\ f'(a_4)
\end{matrix}
\right].
$$ I claim that the determinant of that matrix is $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_3\partial x_4}\left( \prod_{i<j}(x_i-x_j) \right) \left. \right|_{x_i=a_i\,\,\forall i}$. Therefore, $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_3\partial x_4}\left( \prod_{i<j}(x_i-x_j) \right) \left. \right|_{x_i=a_i\,\,\forall i}\neq 0$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a polynomial to exist uniquely. In particular, I am interested in estimating the error of such a polynomial interpolation, since I don't see how to modify the normal Hermite estimation.","['calculus', 'polynomials', 'interpolation', 'reference-request', 'derivatives']"

924692,Can't understand this simple passage involving multivariable calculus,"A certain passage in my Fundamentals of Thermodynamics book is driving me crazy. I considered posting this is Physics.SE, but I think the question is eminently mathematical. Here is the passage: As we know, $c_p$ is defined as: $$c_p = \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial T} \right)_p \tag1$$
  We also have seen that: $$T\ ds = dh - v\ dp \tag2$$
  Therefore: $$c_p = T \left({\partial s \over \partial T} \right)_p \tag3$$ I've spent hours trying to figure out how to get to $(3)$. I really want to do this as rigorously as a graduated mechanical engineer can. So far I have two ""approaches,"" one that is fine for most of my friends but is very informal and another that is more correct, but leads me nowhere. In case it's needed, let me give some background on the thermodynamic variables: for curiosity's sake, $c_p$ means specific heat in a constant pressure process; $p, v, T, u, h, s$ are properties, of which any one can be seen as a function of any other two; the notation $\left({\partial a \over \partial b}\right)_c$ means that, in that derivative, $a = a(b,c)$, so its purpose is to make it clear that the variable held constant is $c$. Approach 1: simple but ""wrong"" From $(2)$, we have: $$dh = T\ ds + v\ dp \tag4$$ We plug that directly into $\partial h$ of $(1)$ to obtain: $$c_p = \left({T\ \partial s + v\ \partial p \over \partial T} \right)_p \tag5$$ Since $p$ is held constant, $\partial p = 0$, so $(3)$ emerges. My problems with this: Making $\partial h = dh$ and plugging it in $(1)$ looks awful to me. I've never seen a ""partial differential"" outside of a partial derivative (e.g. $\partial h$ by itself). We usually take that liberty with ""total differentials,"" but I've never seen that done with partials. $\partial p$ can't even exist inside the derivative of $(5)$, since it would mean $p = p(T, p)$, which... does it make any sense?! Anyway, it can be argued that the partial derivative would indeed be zero, but it sucks. Approach 2: correct but dead end If we make $h = h(T, p)$, then comes: $$dh = \left({\partial h \over \partial T} \right)_p  dT + \left({\partial h \over \partial p} \right)_T dp\tag6$$ Equating with $(4)$ gives: $$\left({\partial h \over \partial T} \right)_p = T\frac{ds}{dT} + \frac{dp}{dT}\left[v - \left({\partial h \over \partial p} \right)_T \right] \tag7$$ So, from $(1)$: $$c_p = T\frac{ds}{dT} + \frac{dp}{dT}\left[v - \left({\partial h \over \partial p} \right)_T \right] \tag8$$ Which doesn't look like $(3)$ at all. In order to make it better, we could ""open up"" $\frac{ds}{dT}$ with $s(T,p)$ and eventually find: $$c_p = T \left({\partial s \over \partial T} \right)_p + \frac{dp}{dT}\left[v - \left({\partial h \over \partial p} \right)_T + T \left({\partial s \over \partial p} \right)_T \right] \tag9$$ We'd need the second term to be zero, but $\frac{dp}{dT}$ certainly isn't and I don't see why the $[\cdots]$ would be either. Did I go wrong somewhere? Is Approach 2 really optimal? I appreciate any help.",['multivariable-calculus']

924745,How to encode matrices uniquely,"Given a square matrix $A=[a_{ij}]_{n \times n}$, an operation $swap(A, i, j)$ is defined to swap row $i$ and $j$ of $A$ and do the same thing with the corresponding columns. For example, in the following example, we can see the $swap(A, 1, 3)$: $$A=\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i \end{array} \right] ~~~~~\Rightarrow~~~~~ swap(A,1,3)=\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
i & h & g \\
f & e & d \\
c & b & a \end{array} \right]$$ For a matrix $A$, let $swap^k(A)$ be the set of matrices produced by exactly $k$ swaps.  For example $B \in swap^3(A)$ means that there is a sequence of 3 swaps that can convert $A$ into $B$.

925036,Understanding branch cuts by manually choosing the branch cuts of a function,"Below I will explain what I have done in order to illustrate my confusion with branch cuts of a typical function. If I say something wrong at any point please do not hesitate to correct me! In order to understand branch cuts and to go about implementing tailored versions of multivalued complex functions in python (or any other language), I have experimented with some implementations, and the writing in this post can be thought of me ""thinking aloud."" I will explain all the code so it won't be necessary to know python specifically, its basically pseudo code anyway. So lets start, I have the complex function: \begin{align}
w = \sqrt{z^2-1}.
\end{align} With $z=x+iy$. This function will be used in a computer program, and I want to ensure that for all values $z$ can take on along a specified path, $w$ will remain continuous. Furthermore let's say for this particular problem that I want to ensure that my branch cuts are +1 to $+\infty$ and -1 to $-\infty$, and that $w$ is continuous in the upper half plane. I don't trust the way standard functions in python handle branch cuts, so I start by looking at real and imaginary $w$ over the argand plane. Here is the python version: def python_func(z):
    return np.sqrt(z**2-1) #pretty self explanatory: returns sqrt(z^2-1) for a given z I then take this function and plot the real and imaginary parts over the argand plane: So it appears python introduces a discontinuity along the imaginary axis! This is not what I want so I decide to define my own version of the function above. The code consists mainly of two functions, a ""myatan"" which manually assigns the inverse tangent in the range $(0,2\pi)$ as a point moves along the quadrants anti-clockwise, and ""my_func"" which implements my required version of $w$. In constructing this function I reason as follows: For the required branch cuts above, if $|z|<1$ then arg$(w)$ should be continuous around the origin. But if $|z|>1$ then we need to factorize $ \sqrt{z^2-1}=\sqrt{z-1}\sqrt{z+1}$ and look at each factor in turn: $\sqrt{z-1}$: make arg$(\sqrt{z-1})$ jump across the line +1 to $+\infty$ $\sqrt{z+1}$: make arg$(\sqrt{z+1})$ jump across the line -1 to $-\infty$ The python definition of the functions are: import numpy as np #a module needed for some of the math functions used.
import math         #a module needed for some of the math functions used.

#(x,y) are the coordinates of a point on a 2D plane
# the math.atan function does what you expects, it returns the inverse tangent as in a triangle 

def myatan(y,x):
      if y == 0:
           if x > 0:
                return 0
           if x < 0:
                return np.pi
           if x == 0:
                return 0
      if y > 0:
           if x > 0:
                return math.atan(y/x)

                return np.pi/2
      if y < 0:
           if x > 0:
                return 2*np.pi + math.atan(y/x)
           if x < 0:
                return np.pi + math.atan(y/x)

def my_func(z):

    temp = z**2-1
    if abs(z) < 1: #if condition is true execute the next few lines indented 
        theta = myatan(np.imag(temp),np.real(temp))

        return np.sqrt(r1*r2)*np.exp(1j/2*(theta1+theta2)) With this new definition of our function we get the following plot: and now there are clear branch cuts as we want them. However the plots from the two methods look very different and so I started thinking, am I really getting the value I am supposed to from my customised function? To look at the values returned by the function I decided to plot the real and imaginary values of $w$ as I walk along a circle of different radii: For circle radius 0.9, we see that my_func does not have any jumps as we want: For circle radius 1.1, we see that my_func has jumps at $\theta = \pi$ and $\theta = 2\pi$ as expected: The only problem I have is this: I am happy with the branch cuts of my function: it seems that I have gotten that part right because my_func is continuous in the range I want it to be. But how do I know that it takes on the right value in that range? I am using this function in a physics based simulation, so it should clearly matter whether the real/imaginary part of $w$ takes on the negative or positive possibility as can be seen from the latest graphs above. How do I know I am calculating the correct ""version"" of my function given the branch cuts I have chosen?","['branch-cuts', 'complex-analysis']"

Then, any function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is not an injection, i.e. there exists distinct elements $x_1$ and $x_2\in X$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ My first question is: This version of the theorem is different than what I have seen in other texts, which typically takes this form. How is the theorem stated in my text equivalent to the version stated in the Proofwiki? This looks more like the pigeonhole principle to me (without requiring that $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets). I'd like some help on proving this theorem as stated in my text. What I've tried: I will prove the contrapositive of the theorem, namely: For non empty sets $X$ and $Y$ , if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is an injection, then $|X|\le |Y|$ So, if $f$ is an injection, then $f$ may or may not be a surjection. If $f$ is also a surjection, then we have a bijection $X\rightarrow Y$ , which means each $X$ and $Y$ can be paired together. Hence, both $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality. if $f$ is not surjective, then this means $\exists y \in Y,\forall x\in X,f(x)\ne y$ . This means that there is at least one element in $y$ that can't be paired with an element in $X$ . Hence we conclude that the cardinality of $Y$ is larger that the cardinality of $X$ . Therefore, $|X|\le |Y|$ as required. Is my proof acceptable? I feel a bit uneasy stating that $X$ and $Y$ can or can not be paired, but given the information in the theorem, I don't know of a more precise way to write this proof. EDIT :
Asaf Karagila's comment made me reread my text and found the following definition of comparing the cardinalities of two sets: Two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality, written $|X|=|Y|$ , if there are equipotent, i.e. there is a bijection $X\rightarrow$ Y. If there is an injection $X\rightarrow Y$ , then we write $|X|\le |Y|$ . We write $|X|<|Y|$ to mean that $|X|\le |Y|$ and $|X|\ne|Y|$ and say that $X$ has smaller cardinality than $Y$ . So, in light of the above definition, the contrapositive of the theorem is true because the definition above makes it true.

How does one notate such a geometric object? Concerning the properties: the gradient is a vector field depicting the ""slope"" of the function in any point using a vector (i.e.: an orientation and a magnitude). The Hessian-Matrix shows us the rate of change of the gradient (correct use of words?). So by this analogy, the third derivative measures the rate of change of the second derivative. But how?

925332,"Atiyah-Macdonald, Problem 6 of Chapter 1","I was trying to solve the following problem from Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Atiyah and Macdonald. (It is Problem 6 of Chapter 1.) While trying to solve the problem, I am facing trouble in the final stage of my attempt which is mentioned after the problem. Please help me to solve it. A ring $A$ is such that every ideal not contained in the nilradical contains a nonzero
idempotent (that is, an element $e$ such that $e^2 = e \ne 0$ ). Prove that the
nilradical and Jacobson radical of $A$ are equal. I have tried and what I have done so far is the following: Since one side inclusion ie Nilradical = $N(A)\subseteq J(A)$ = Jacobson radical is obvious so I think it is sufficient to prove that every prime ideal in $A$ is maximal. To prove so let $P$ be a prime ideal and say $x\in A-P$ (ie $x+P\ne 0+P$ ) and thus by applying given condition on $<x>$ we have $\exists a\in A $ such that $a\ne0,ax=a^2x^2$ So considering $A/P$ (which is integral domain as $P$ is prime ideal) we see $(ax+P)((ax+P)-(1+P))=0+P$ and hence $ax\in P$ or $ax-1\in P$ If the later is true then $(a+P)(x+P)=1+P \Rightarrow A/P$ is field $\Rightarrow P$ maximal. But I failed to exclude the first case ie I can't prove $ax\notin P$ . Maybe I am missing something very easy or there may be an easier way to solve the problem. Please help me.

\end{cases}$ My steps:
$\lim_{x\uparrow 1} f(x) = \lim_{x\downarrow 1} f(x)$ $\frac{-8x^2 + 48x - 40}{x - 1} = -2x + k$ $\frac{-8(x^2 - 6x + 5)}{x - 1} = -2x + k$ $\frac{-8(x - 5)(x - 1)}{x - 1} = -2x + k$ $-8(x - 5) = -2x + k$ $-8x - (-8)\cdot5 = -2x + k$ $-8x + 40 = -2x + k$ $-8x + 2x + 40 = k$ (See note at bottom) $-6x + 40 = k$ $-6\cdot1 + 40 = k$ $-6 + 40 = k$ $36 = k$ The solution steps: For f to be continuous at $x = 1$ we need $\lim_{x\uparrow 1} f(x) = \lim_{x\downarrow1} f(x) = f(1)$ First lets evaluate lim xâ1â f(x) . Since x < 1 as x approaches 1 from the left, f(x) = (â8x^2 + 48x â 40)/(x â 1) as xâ1â So lim xâ1â f(x) = lim xâ1â  (â8x^2 + 48x â 40)/(x â 1) Start by factoring the numerator. In this case we find: lim xâ1â (â8x^2 + 48x â 40)/(â3x^2 â 15x + 18) = lim xâ1â (â8x + 40)(x â 1)/(x â 1) Aside: can anyone explain (â3x^2 â 15x + 18) in the denominator? Since we are taking the limit as xâ1â , we may assume that x â  1 . Canceling factors we see: \lim xâ1â (â8x + 40)(x â 1)/(â3x â 18)(x â 1) = \lim xâ1â (â8x + 40) We can evaluate this linear function at x = 1 . Hence, lim xâ1â â8x^2 + 48x â 40)/(â3x^2 â 15x + 18) = â8(1) + 40 . Thus, lim xâ1â f(x) = 32 . Thus lim xâ1â f(x) = 32 lim xâ1+ f(x) = lim xâ (â2x + k) , because x > 1 as x approaches 1 from the right. lim xâ (â2x + k) = â2â1 + k = â2 + k = f(1) because linear functions are continuous. For f to be continuous, these limits have to be equal. Thus 32 = â2 + k When k = 34 , f is continuous. NOTE: This is where I diverged from the solution by moving -2x to the left. My question is, assuming the given solution is correct, why is this nominally valid algebraic step not permitted?",['limits']

But $$z'(x)=\exp\left\{x\log(1-\frac1x)\right\}\left[\log(1-\frac1x)+\frac{1}{x-1}\right]$$ $e^a$ is always positive.

926139,Closure of the product of two sets vs product of their closures.,"This exercise is from Chapter 2, Section 17, number 9, pag. 101, from Munkres's Topology. Let $A \subset X$ and $B \subset Y$. Show that in the space $X \times Y$, we have $\overline {A \times B} = \overline A \times \overline B$.",['general-topology']
926180,etale neighborhoods,"I've read that quasi-compact etale morphisms of schemes over a not necessarily algebraiclly closed field $F$ (I'm happy to take $F$ a field of char $0$) are the algebraic analogs of local diffeomorphisms. I also know that etale morphisms are open maps, but not usually open immersions (for this, we also need ""radiciality""). Now, my question concerns the notion of etale neighborhoods . Let $f : Y \to X$ be a quasi-compact etale map of $F$-schemes (I'm happy to take $X,Y$ to be smooth and proper and $X$ also geometrically connected). Let $y \in Y$ and let $x = f(y) \in X$ and let $\phi: (S,y) \to (X,x)$ be an etale neighborhood. My intuition tells me that, since the word ""neighborhood"" is there, I should be able to make $S$ small enough (but still an etale neighborhood) such that $\phi$ is an open immersion . Is this intuition correct? If not, how can we get something resembling a local isomorphism between $S$ and $X$?","['arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
926186,$f$ is uniformly continuous $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathrm{Re}f$ and $\mathrm{Im}f$ are uniformly continuous.,"Let $f$ be a complex-valued function. In many  complex analysis textbook, I have just found that $f$ is continuous $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathrm{Re}f$ and $\mathrm{Im}f$ are continuous. I wonder that whether $f$ is uniformly continuous $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathrm{Re}f$ and $\mathrm{Im}f$ are uniformly continuous. Do you know any book contain this statement? I would very much appreciate any help or guidance you are able to give me.","['complex-analysis', 'uniform-continuity']"
926190,"nonlinear, nonhomogeneous ODE 1. order","Solve $x'(t)-\dfrac{a}{t}x(t)=b(t),~a=const,~x(0)=0$. Homogeneous Solution: $\dfrac{x'(t)}{x(t)}=\dfrac{a}{t}\quad|\int\\
\ln(x(t))=a\ln(t)+c,~c=const\quad| e\\
x(t)=t^ae^c$ Is that correct? No clue how to figure the particular solution or the general solution respectively. edit: Thanks  @agha for the helpfull comment. I try to write down the entire solution. With a slighty different Noation. Let $t\in[0,t_f]$
$$(1)~ x'(t) - \dfrac{a}{t}x(t) = b(t)$$
$$(2)~ x_h(t) = Kt^a$$ Particular Solution:
$$x_s(t) = c(t)t^a~\text{with}~ x'(t) = c'(t)t^a + c(t)at^{a-1}$$ Substitute in (1)
$$c'(t)t^a + c(t)at^{a-1} - \dfrac{a}{t}c(t)t^a = b(t)$$
$$c'(t) = \dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}\quad |\int{}$$
$$c(t) = \int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt} + K'$$ It follows for $x_s(t)$
$$(3)~ x_s(t) = \left(\int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt} + K'\right)t^a$$ The general solution reads (2)+(3), i.e.
$$(4)~ x(t) = Kt^a + \left(\int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt} + K'\right)t^a = \left(\int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt} + K''\right)t^a\\
\text{where}~ K''=K+K'$$ With the initial conditon $x(0)=0$ we might identify $K''$ 
$$(5)~ x(0) = 0 = \int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt}\bigg|_{t_f} + K''\\
K'' = -\int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt}\bigg|_{t_f}$$ Thus the solution reads:
$$(6)~x(t) = \left(\int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt} - \int{\dfrac{b(t)}{t^a}dt}\bigg|_{t_f}\right)t^a$$ Am I right?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
