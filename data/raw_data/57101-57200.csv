622822,Old Qualifying Exam Question (Real Analysis - Possibly Implicit Function Theorem),"The following is an old qualifying exam question that has stumped me: Let $f,g\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$ be real-valued functions such that for some $x_0\in \mathbb{R}^3,$ we have $f(x_0) = g(x_0) = 0$ with $df(x_0)$ and $dg(x_0)$ linearly independent. Let $S_f$ and $S_g$ be the zero sets of $f$ and $g$ respectively. Show that if $h\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$ vanishes on $S_f\cup S_g,$ then there exists a neighborhood $U\ni x_0$ such that in $U,$ we have $h(x) = f(x)g(x)H(x),$ for some $H\in C^\infty(U)$. My initial thought was that the implicit function theorem might be a good place to start, but I have not been able to make any progress on it. Any thoughts are much appreciated.",['analysis']
622841,Can an Element of an Algebraic Structure have Multiple Identities?,"I'm wondering if an element of an algebraic structure can have two (or more) two-sided identities. Google wasn't very helpful, and I have never encountered anything with the given properties. Essentially, I'm looking for $g,h,i \in X$ such that $X$ is an algebraic structure, $ig=gi=g, hg=gh=g,$ and $h \neq i$ I have a basic knowledge of algebraic structures, and would appreciate if someone could provide an example of an algebraic structure that contains an element with two or more two-sided identities, or a brief explanation of why it is not possible. If this property varies based on the type of algebraic structure, the algebraic structures in which I am most interested are Groups, Rings, and Fields. Thanks for the help!",['abstract-algebra']
622848,Two simple questions about the complex function $f(z)=e^z$,"I am working on basic problems about complex numbers and functions in order to learn complex analysis from Lang's textbook. I am trying to solve the following exercise: Let $f:\mathbb C \to \mathbb C$, $f(z)=e^z$ (if $z=a+bi$, then $e^z=e^ae^{ib}$) a) Find the image under $f$ of the set $S=\{z \in \mathbb C : 0\leq Im(z)<2\pi\}$. b) Show that the image of the line $\{t+it : t \in \mathbb R\}$ is a spiral. For a), I am not so sure how to describe the image, I know that if $z=a+bi$, then $b \in [0,2\pi)$. By definition, $e^{ib}=\cos(b)+i\sin(b)$, so the image of the set $S$ is $T=\{w \in \mathbb C : w=f(z)=e^a(\cos(b)+i\sin(b)), \space b \in [0,2\pi)\}$ Is this a correct way of describing the image of the given set? For part b), I don't know how to show this, maybe I need to find a possible parameterization $\phi(t)$ of the set $\{(u(t),v(t),t) \in \mathbb R^3\}$ where if $w=f(z(t))$, then $w=u(t)+iv(t)$. If $z$ is in the line, then $z=t+it$, and $f(z)=e^t(\cos(t)+i\sin(t))=e^t\cos(t)+ie^t\sin(t)$, so the parametrization would be $\phi(t)=(e^t\cos(t),e^t\sin(t),t)$ Is this the parameterization of a spiral?","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"
622869,Elements of order 2 in the absolute Galois group,"So I remember reading once that the only element of $G=Gal(\overline{\Bbb Q} / \Bbb Q)$ that we understand is complex conjugation. Suppose we fix an embedding of $\overline{\Bbb Q}$ into $\Bbb C$. Then complex conjugation in $\Bbb C$ restricts to a ""complex conjugation"", $\sigma \in G$. Clearly $\sigma$ has order $2$, and any conjugate of $\sigma$ also has order $2$. Question: Is it true that any element of order $2$ in $G$ is conjugate to $\sigma$? I've thought about this for a while, but my knowledge of elements of $G$ isn't excellent. For general groups, not all elements of order $2$ are necessarily conjugate. For example, $(12)$ and $(12)(34)$ are both of order $2$ but not conjugate in $S_n$ for any $n\geq 4$. It is unclear how to proceed in the case of $G$. My reason for asking is that the element $\sigma$ I defined above should only be thought of as being defined up to conjugacy, since a different embedding gives a new complex conjugation which is conjugate to $\sigma$. Thus, if all elements of order $2$ in $G$ were conjugate then I believe I could conclude that there is really only a single honest complex conjugation. I apologize if any of this is unclear, I'd be glad to elaborate if necessary. Also, I'd appreciate any intuition on how to think about this in terms of Galois representations, since those seem to be the only way to get a handle on $G$.","['galois-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'group-theory', 'galois-representations']"
622892,"How to simply show that there are ""78 'strict ordinal' 2x2 game matrices""","In ""Theory of Moves"" , Steven J. Brams analyses two-player games with two strategies per player, where each player can totally rank his payoffs, although payoffs need not be comparable among players. We can thus use values 1,2,3,4 to label the payoffs of each player. This is called a 'strict ordinal' game. An example game matrix, with player A's payoff as the first element, player B's payoff as the second element of the payoff tuples: We now define the equivalence classes of ""identical game matrices"" to reduce the number of distinct cases to analyze. The game matrices in an equivalence class are related by the following operations: Exchange columns (i.e. relabel Player A's strategies) Exchange rows (i.e. relabel Player B's strategies) Exchange the players, which means exchanging the tuple values and mirroring the matrix along the first diagonal For discussion purposes, add the non-elementary operation: Exchange columns, then rows (or the equivalent reverse): ""mirroring"" Question: How many game matrix equivalence classes are there? The author claims ""There are exactly 78 such 'strict ordinal' 2x2 games"". He must be right because his whole book is based on this. And I checked with a little program, and indeed I get 78 distinct ""canonical"" matrixes. However, using exhaustive enumeration is quite a bit in the 'brute force' domain and I am not even sure why the application of a single ""player exchange"" followed by either a ""row exchange"", ""column exchange"" or ""mirroring"" is sufficient to reach all the elements of the equivalence classes. So, is there a better way to show that there are only 78 equivalence classes (which actually is strange because this is 13 * 3 * 2, why is there a factor 13?). There has got to be. I amused myself to design a way to build the canonical matrixes by exploiting symmetries but it seems I am too rusty. Code result: [ (4,4),(1,2) | (2,3),(3,1) ] accepted as canonical entry 1

If A is diagonal, it is not too hard to show that $AD = DA$, because multiplying two diagonal matrices just amounts to multiplying the corresponding diagonal entries. $\Rightarrow$: 
(i) $DA$ is found by multiplying each row in A with the corresponding entry along the diagonal in $D$. $AD$ is found by multiplying each column in $A$ with the corresponding entry along the diagonal in $D$. Since $AD = DA$, this product has to be symmetric. (ii) Now suppose $A$ weren't a diagonal matrix. Then if we make the entries along the diagonal in $D$ all different, $AD$ won't be symmetric anymore (?). This contradicts (i), so we have shown both ways. Does this work?

Follow the steps to show that there exists a 1-1, onto function $h:X \rightarrow Y$ and hence $X \sim Y$. a) The range of $f$ is defined by $f(X) = \{y \in Y : y = f(x) \ \text{for some} \ x \in X\}$. Let $y \in f(X)$. Explain why there exists a unique $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Now define $f^{-1}(y) = x$, and show that $f^{-1}$ is a 1-1 function from $f(X)$ onto $X$. In a similar way, we can also define the 1-1, onto function $g^{-1}: g(Y) \rightarrow Y$. b) Let $x \in X$ be arbitrary. Let the chain $C_x$ be the set consisting of all elements of the form:
$$\cdots, f^{-1}(g^{-1}(x)), g^{-1}(x), x, f(x), g(f(x)), f(g(f(x))), \cdots $$ Explain why the number of elements to the left of $x$ in the above chain may be zero, finite, or infinite. c) Show that any two chains are either identical or completely disjoint. d) Note that the terms in the chain above alternate between elements of $X$ and elements of $Y$, i.e.,
$$\cdots, \underbrace{f^{-1}(g^{-1}(x))}_{\in X}, \underbrace{g^{-1}(x)}_{\in Y}, \underbrace{x}_{\in X}, \underbrace{f(x)}_{\in Y}, \underbrace{g(f(x))}_{\in X}, \underbrace{f(g(f(x)))}_{\in Y}, \cdots  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$ Given a chain $C_x$, focus on $C_x \cap Y$, which is just the part of the chain that belongs to $Y$. Define the set $A$ to be the union of all chains $C_x$ satisfying $C_x \cap Y \subseteq f(X)$. Let $B$ be the set of the union of the remaining chains not in $A$. Show that any chain contained in $B$ must be of the form: $$y, g(y), f(g(y)), g(f(g(y))), \cdots $$ where $y$ is an element of $Y$ that is not in $f(X)$. Queries: OK, I can do parts a) to c) , it is part d) which is confusing me right now. Here is my attempt so far. Let $C_{x_0}$ be a chain in $B$, then clearly $C_{x_0} \cap Y \not \subseteq f(X)$, which means there must exist some $y \in Y$ with $y \in C_{x_0}$ such that $y \not \in f(X)$. Referring to expression $(1)$, clearly elements like $f(x_0)$, $f(g(f(x_0)))$, $\cdots$ must be an element of $f(X)$ by definition. So it must be a term of the form like $g^{-1}(x_0)$ which is not an element of $f(X)$.

$$\lim_{n\to +\infty}\int_{(0,1)^n}\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2}{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}d\mu = 1.$$
The correct claim, however, is:
$$\lim_{n\to +\infty}\int_{(0,1)^n}\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2}{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}d\mu = \frac{2}{3}.$$
In fact, following @Tetis' approach we have:
$$I_n = \int_{(0,1)^n}\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n y_j^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_j}d\mu = \int_{(-1/2,1/2)^n}\frac{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2+\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}{1+\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j}d\mu,$$
now setting $x_j=-z_j$ and summing the two integrals
$$I_n = \int_{(-1/2,1/2)^n}\frac{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2+\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}{1-\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}d\mu$$
follows, so:
$$ I_n-\frac{2}{3}=\int_{(-1/2,1/2)^n} \left(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2\right)\frac{\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}{1-\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}d\mu < 0,$$
$$ \left| I_n-\frac{2}{3}\right|\leq\int_{\sum x_i^2\leq\frac{n}{4}}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2\right)\frac{\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}{1-\frac{4}{n^2}\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2}d\mu,$$
$$ \frac{2}{3}-I_n\leq \frac{n^{n/2}}{2^{n+1}} \int_{\sum x_i^2\leq 1}\left(1-\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j^2\right)\frac{x_1^2}{1-x_1^2}d\mu.$$
The last bound, anyway, is too crude, since the RHS is
$$ \Theta\left(\left(\sqrt{\frac{e\pi}{2}}\right)^n\frac{\log n}{n^{3/2}}\right).$$ My question now is: what is the asymptotic behaviour of $I_n$? A second one is: can we prove $I_n\geq\frac{2}{3}-\frac{C}{n}$, for a suitable positive constant $C$, without the Central Limit Theorem? UPDATE: After a few I came out with a proof of my own.

Ideas: For #1, we can show that $f$ must be a bijection, since $f$ failing to be either injective or surjective quickly leads to a contradiction. My intuition tells me that $z\mapsto -z$ should be the only such (non-identity) function. We know $f'(z)\neq 0$ for all $z$ (or else there would be an area where $f$ were not injective). Therefore $1/f'(z)$ is an entire function. Taking derivatives of both sides, we get $f'(f(z))f'(z) = 1$, or $f'(f(z))=1/f'(z)$. $1/f(z)$ should be analytic everywhere, except for a simple pole at $z=f(0)$. Let $\max_{|z|=1}|f(z)-f(0)|=R_1$, then Schwarz's lemma implies that $f'(0)\leq R_1$. Let $\max_{|z|=1}|f(z+f(0))|=R_2$, then Schwarz's lemma implies $f'(f(0))\leq R_2$. But $f'(f(0)) = 1/f'(0)$, so $$\frac1R_2\leq f'(0)\leq R_1.$$ Trying to put all this together... Update: I've got #1. Consider the singularity of $f$ at infinity. If it is removable, then $f$ is a constant by Liouville's theorem. If it is a pole, then $f$ is a polynomial. If it is an essential singularity, then by the Big Picard theorem, $f$ cannot be injective since $f$ will take every value, except perhaps one, in a neighborhood of infinity. Therefore $f$ is a polynomial, and since $f'\neq 0$, we have $f=az+b$ for $a\neq 0$. Now we have $a(az+b)+b = z$, giving that the involutions are $z\mapsto z$ and $z\mapsto -z+c$ for $c\in \mathbb{C}$. Update 2: I think I've got #2 as follows: Suppose $f$ entire such that $f(f(z))=z^2$. Since $z\mapsto z^2$ is surjective, we must have $f$ surjective. Now $2z=f'(f(z))f'(z)$. So we know that $f'(f(z))f'(z)$ is zero only at $z=0$. Either $f'(f(0))=0$ or $f'(0)=0$. Suppose the former holds and not the latter. That is impossible, since then $f(f(z))$ would have zero derivative at two points, zero and $f(0)$. So we know $f'(0)=0$. Since $f$ is surjective, some point must map to zero. It cannot be a nonzero point $a$, because then $f(f(z))$ would have zero derivative at $a$. This implies that zero is the unique point mapping under $f$ to zero. Now $$(z^2)'' = 2 = f''(f(z))f'(z) + f'(f(z))f''(z)$$
and the right hand side is zero at $z=0$, a contradiction. Update 3: Here's what I've got for #3 so far: Note $e^z$ is nowhere zero. So if $f:w\mapsto 0$ then $w\not\in \text{Rg}(f)$. But only $0$ is not in $\text{Rg}(f)$. So only zero could possibly map to zero, but it does not, because $f(f(0))\neq 0$. So $f$ is nonzero. $f'$ is also nonzero since $$(e^z)'=e^z=f'(f(z))f'(z).$$ $f$ should have an essential singularity at infinity.",['complex-analysis']
623459,Branch points of global analytic functions (Ahlfors),"In Ahlfors' complex analysis text, page 298 he discusses the case of a global analytic function $\mathbf{f}$ which can be continued analytically along all arcs in some punctured disk $\{0<|z|< \rho\}$. He then fixes a point $0<z_0=r<\rho$, and an initial germ of $\mathbf{f}$ over that point, and continues that germ along all integer powers of the circle $C=\{|z|=r\}$. There are are two cases: The germ obtained after $m$ windings around the circle never equals the initial one. There is a smallest integer $h$, such that tracing the circle $h$ times leads back to the initial germ. Only the second case is considered further: Ahlfors then says that such a function ""can be expressed as a single valued analytic function $F(\zeta)$"" where $\zeta$ is related to $z$ by the equation $$z=\zeta^h .$$
So far this is only a background, my question regards page 299: On page 299 he constructs $F(\zeta)$ using the initial germ, and expands it in a Laurent series: $$F(\zeta)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty A_n \zeta^n. $$
He then writes: It must be observed that this development depends on the choice of the initial germ; different choices may yield entirely different developments and, in particular, different values of $h$. Actually, even the series $(1)$ yields $h$ different developments, corresponding to the $h$ initial values of
  $z^{1/h}$. If we write $\omega = 
e^{2 \pi i/h},$ these developments are represented by $$\tag{2} f_\nu(z)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty A_n \omega^{\nu n} z^{n/h} \; \; (\nu=0,1,\dots,h-1) $$
  When the germ $(f_\nu,z_0)$ is continued along $C$ it leads to $(f_{\nu+1},z_0)$ with the
  understanding that the subscript $h$ is identified with $0$. I have a few questions regarding the quoted part above: What does he mean by the initial values of $z^{1/h}$? What does he mean by using the word ""developments""? Obviously, the Laurent development of $F(\zeta)$ holds in the entire punctured disk, but where do these ""Puiseux developments"" $\{f_\nu\}$ hold? How can I rigorously show that continuing $(f_\nu,z_0)$ along $C$ leads to $(f_{\nu+1},z_0)$? Intuitively, I guess as $z$ traces the circle $C$ once, $z$ transforms by the map $z \mapsto e^{2\pi i } z $, and from there $(e^{2 \pi i} z)^{n/h}=\omega^n z^{n/h}$. However, I know that using the power rule $(z w)^r=z^r w^r$ isn't that straightforward for complex numbers... Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!","['self-learning', 'complex-analysis']"
623465,How can $n$ variables have $2n$ degrees of freedom?,"Formally, if $Y_i\sim \mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, then $2\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \sim \Gamma(n,2)$, which is the chi-squared distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom. Intuitively, however, I think of degrees of freedom as the number of variables that are free to vary minus the number of constraints. In other words, the degrees of freedom of a problem, such as a hypothesis test, is like the dimension of the space that the data lives in. And this is, in fact, how most of the webpages I have visited suggest we think about degrees of freedom. But in many tests $2n$ degrees of freedom are used for sample size $n$ without much explanation except the formal one above. An example is a one sided test of the mean of $n$ independent exponential variables or confidence intervals on failure times. So I'm having a hard time trying to attach a meaning to the extra $n$ degrees. I'm thinking that even though there are $n$ variables there is some underlying geometry that is higher dimensional. There has to be an intuitive explanation for the extra ""wiggle room"" in these problems. This question arose from a specific question from a review sheet in my class. The question is if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are iid $N(0,1)$, find a Uniformly Most Powerful test of size $\alpha$ for $H_0: \sigma^2=\sigma_0^2$ vs. $H_1: \sigma^2>\sigma_0^2$. I found that the family of distributions has a monotone likelihood ratio in $Y(X)=\sum X_i^2$ so that a UMP is
\begin{align*}
 T(X)=\begin{cases}
        1 & Y(X)>c, \\
        0 & Y(X)<c.
   \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Thus, $\alpha=\mathrm{P}_0\left(\frac{Y(X)}{\sigma_0^2}>c/\sigma_0^2\right)$, and since the sum of squares of standard normal variables has a $\chi^2$ distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom, I would have said $c=\sigma_0^2\chi^2_\alpha(n)$. The professor, however says that the notation for this is $c = \sigma_0^2 \chi^2_\alpha(2n)$. The professor is unavailable for comment, but she's used the same review sheet for years so think she means what she says.

623536,How is the radian measure of angles derived/defined?,"I'm currently studying angles and their measures and I've just been told that $\pi$ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, so: $\pi =\dfrac {C}{d}$ $\pi =\dfrac {C}{2r}$ $ 2\pi =\dfrac {C}{r}$ So essentially what this is saying is that for every circle the ratio of its circumference to its radius is always $2\pi$. However the textbook then goes onto introduce the radian measure, it says (paraphrasing) that suppose we now take a portion of the circle instead of the entire circumference 'C' and compare that to the radius, this portion of the circumference is some arc length 's', and the angle subtended by it is $\theta $, using ""proportionality arguments"" it stands to reason that $\dfrac {s}{r}$ should be constant among all circles and that this ratio '$\dfrac {s}{r}$' defines the radian measure. My Question is: (1) How was the relationship $\theta =\dfrac {s}{r}$ derived? How do we go from a formula: $ 2\pi =\dfrac {C}{r}$  that is a ratio of the circumference to the radius, to then come to be defined in terms of theta: $\theta =\dfrac {s}{r}$ (which gives the ratio of the length of an arc to the radius).

An example is $f=\sin$. The set $V$ contains the linearly independent functions $\sin$ and $\cos$ (since $\cos(x)=\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{2})$). By elementary trigonometry we have $c\sin(x+\phi) = s\sin x + t\cos x$ for any $c, \phi \in \mathbb{R}$ and some $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$, so it follows that $V$ is a vector space of dimension two spanned by $\sin$ and $\cos$.

Recently I stumbled into a similar claim for $n\times n$ matrices, but instead of even and odd, the set of square matrices has a direct sum representation in terms of symmetric and skew symmetric parts. So given any square matrix $A$ we can write $B=\dfrac{A+A^T}{2}$ and $C=\dfrac{A-A^T}{2}$ as the symmetric and skew symmetric representations where $A=B+C$.

I am wondering if it holds when the sequence contains one element with mean that increasing in $n$ (but not too fast).  In fact, I am asking a question about a triangular array. In my particular case, I have a triangular array $\{\{X_{1n},\ldots,X_{(n-1)n}, X_{nn}$ where $X_{in}>0$ and independent across all rows and columns; $X_{1n},\ldots,X_{(n-1)n}$ are identical with $\mathbb{E}[X_{1n}]=1$ and $\mathbb{E}[X_{1n}^2]=e^{2(\log n)^{a}}$ where $0<a<1$; and $\mathbb{E}[X_{nn}]=e^{(\log n)^{a}}$ and $\mathbb{E}[X_{nn}^2]=e^{4(\log n)^{a}}$.  Since $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{e^{(\log n)^{a}}}{n}=0$, the contribution of $X_{nn}$ to the average $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_{in}$ is small, and, thus, maybe the SLLN holds ""row-wise"".  I can use the Chebyshev's inequality to prove the weak law of large numbers for this case.  However, my tool for proving almost sure convergence, the Borel-Cantelli lemma, seems to not work here at all (though I might not be using correctly).  Can someone help? Minor edits to above : 
Per responses and comments, I corrected some typos as well as notation for the random variables, and clarified that what I am dealing is, in fact, a triangular array. Main edit I was asked in the comments/answers about where this question came from and more information about $X_i$'s.  Here I describe the setting from which this problem arose. I am given a machine which takes $n$ as input.  As an output it gives me a sequence of $n$ random variables $X_{1n},\ldots,X_{nn}$, where: $$X_{in}=\exp\left[\frac{f(n)\Gamma_{in}}{1+f(n)}-k\left(\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}+\left[\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right]^2\right)\right], \text{  when }i\neq S\\
X_{in}=\exp\left[f(n)\Gamma_i-k\left(\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}+\left[\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right]^2\right)\right], \text{  when }i=S\\$$
where $k=n^c$, $0<c<1$, the sequence $\Gamma_{1n},\ldots,\Gamma_{nn}$ contains $n$ i.i.d. chi-squared random variables, each with $k$ degrees of freedom (note, the number of degrees of freedom for each $\Gamma_{in}$ depends on $n$, however, the independence holds across rows), $f(n)=\sqrt{\frac{(\log n)^{a}}{k}}$, and $1\leq S \leq n$ is unknown.  I am interested in the average $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_{in}$ and, specifically would like to show that, even though I don't know what $S$ is, $X_{Sn}$ does not impact the average for large enough input $n$.  The statement I want is this: for any $\epsilon>0$, with probability one there exists $n_0$ such that for all $n\geq n_0$, $\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_{in}-1\right|<\epsilon$. Using the formula for the moment generating function of chi-squared random variable, and the Taylor series expansion of $\log(1-x)$ around $x=0$, I arrive at the means: $$\begin{array}{rcl}E[X_{in}]&=&\exp\left[\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{(\log n)^{3a}}{k}}\right)\right]\approx1, \text{ when }i\neq S\\
E[X_{Sn}]&=&\exp\left[-\frac{k}{2}\log\left(1-2f(n)\right)-k\left(\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}+\left[\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right]^2\right)\right]\\
&=&\exp\left[kf^2(n)+\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{(\log n)^{3a}}{k}}\right)\right]\\
&\approx&e^{(\log n)^a}
\end{array}$$
The second moments are computed similarly:
$$\begin{array}{rcl}E[X_{in}^2]&=&\exp\left[-\frac{k}{2}\log\left(1-\frac{4f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right)-2k\left(\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}+\left[\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right]^2\right)\right], \text{ when }i\neq S\\
&=&\exp\left[2kf^2(n)+\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{(\log n)^{3a}}{k}}\right)\right]\\
&\approx&e^{2(\log n)^a}\\
E[X_{Sn}^2]&=&\exp\left[-\frac{k}{2}\log\left(1-4f(n)\right)-2k\left(\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}+\left[\frac{f(n)}{1+f(n)}\right]^2\right)\right]\\
&=&\exp\left[4kf^2(n)+\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{(\log n)^{3a}}{k}}\right)\right]\\
&\approx&e^{4(\log n)^a}

Using Chebyshev's inequality, it's straightforward to show that for any $\epsilon>0$, $\delta>0$, there exists $n_0$ such that for all $n\geq n_0$,
$P\left(\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i-1\right|>\epsilon\right)<\delta$, but I was hoping for a stronger result.  The discussion in answers and comments is discouraging, however.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"

The degrees of the divisors in the problem are obviously equal, but I'm not sure how to show $A(D_1)=A(D_2)$ If you know the group law on $X$ or have an explicit isomorphism between $X$ and $\mathbb{C}/L$ then you can compute $A$, but this is far from a trivial result and is not covered by the text.

623728,The Definition of Convex Surface,"Let $\Sigma$ be a $C^{\infty}$ compact surface in $R^3$ .

For 1),I've tried to prove it for the function $\cos(z)$ (I suppose the other one is analogue)  so I've used the fact that $\cos(z)=\dfrac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}$. Let $w \in \mathbb C$, I want to show there exists $z \in \mathbb C : f(z)=w$, i.e., $\dfrac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}=w$, multiplying by $2$ and then by $e^{iz}$ yields $e^{2iz}+1=2we^{iz}$ iff $e^{2iz}-2we^{iz}+1=0$. I don't know if this approach is the correct one but here I've replaced $e^{iz}$ by $x$, so the solutions of the equation would be the roots of the polynomial $p(x)=x^2-2wx+1$, by the quadratic formula, I get that $x \in \{\dfrac{2w+w_0}{2},\dfrac{2w-w_0}{2}\}$, where $w_0^2=4w^2-4$. Then, $e^{iz} \in \{\dfrac{2w+w_0}{2},\dfrac{2w-w_0}{2}\}$. At this point I got lost, I would like to explicitly show that $z$ exists and I can't see existence directly from the fact that $e^{iz}=\dfrac{2w+w_0}{2}$ or $e^{iz}=\dfrac{2w-w_0}{2}$. First I thought of taking logarithm of both sides of the equation ir order to solve for $z$, but this is not a legitimate operation unless $e^{iz} \in \mathbb R$. I couldn't go any farther. For point 2) I have no idea what to do, should I use the identity $\cos(z)=\dfrac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}$?

623781,Is this a solution to the indefinite integral of $e^{-x^2}$?,"$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x$, the Gaussian integral, is notorious throughout physics and statistics. Its definite integral defined over $\mathbb{R}$ is $\sqrt{\pi}$. However, the current indefinite integral is not an elementary solution. Recently I thought about an integration technique that uses ""error correcting."" If we define a function $f(x)$ such that $f^{(n)}(x)$ still contains terms from $f(x)$ (most likely $f(x)$ will always contain $e^x$), then we can take its derivative, set it up to attempt at the integral, and correct any errors until solution is satisfied. Here's how I went about it:
$$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x \\
\frac{\mathbb{d}}{\mathbb{d}x} [e^{-x^2}] = -2xe^{-x^2}$$
We can therefore take a naïve guess and state that:
$$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x = -\frac 1 {2x} e^{-x^2}$$
This isn't true, because differentiated, the result is:
$$e^{-x^2} (1 + \frac 1 {2x^2})$$
Using this, we could try to subtract $\frac{e^{-x^2}}{2x^2}$ from our first approximation of the integral (again, naïve):
$$\int e^{-x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x = e^{-x^2} (-\frac 1 {2x} - \frac 1 {2x^2})$$
Differentiating:
$$e^{-x^2}(1 + x^{-1} + \frac 1 2 x^{-2} + x^{-3})$$
The last three terms seem pretty simple to take the integral of, so if we subtract the integral of those three terms from our guess, perhaps we could obtain the correct answer. Let $\phi$ be our approximation.
$$\phi = e^{-x^2} (-\frac 1 {2x} - \frac 1 {2x^2}) - (\int \frac {e^{-x^2}} x \, \mathbb{d} x + \int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x + \int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^3} \, \mathbb{d} x)$$
$$\int \frac {e^{-x^2}} x \, \mathbb{d} x$$
Let us substitute $u = x^2$ and $\mathbb{d}u = 2x \mathbb{d}x$.
$$\frac 1 2 \int \frac {e^{-u}} u \, \mathbb{d} u$$
Substitute $A = e^{-u}$ and $\mathbb{d}A = -e^{-u}$.
$$\frac 1 2 \int \frac {\mathbb{d}A} {\ln A}$$
This is a relatively simple integral.
$$\frac 1 2 \int \frac {\mathbb{d}A} {\ln A} = \frac 1 2 (\ln |\ln A| + \ln A + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln^k A}{k k!})$$
We can do the exact same substitution for $\int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^3} \, \mathbb{d} x$.
$$\int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^3} \, \mathbb{d} x = \frac 1 2 \int \frac {\mathbb{d}A} {\ln^2 A} \\
 = \frac 1 2 (\ln |\ln A| + \ln A + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln^k A}{k k!} - \frac A {\ln A})$$
 However, $\int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x$ requires a different substitution. Substitute $u = x^4$, $\mathbb{d}u = 4x^3 \mathbb{d}x$, $G = e^{-u^{1/2}}$, and $\mathbb{d}G = -\frac 1 2 u^{-1/2} e^{-u^{1/2}} \mathbb{d}u$.
 $$\int \frac{e^{-x^2}} {x^2} \, \mathbb{d} x = \frac 1 2 \int \frac{\mathbb{d}G}{\ln^2 G} \\
 = \frac 1 2 (\ln |\ln G| + \ln G + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln^k G}{k k!} - \frac G {\ln G})$$
 If we substitute, we find that the integral of $e^{-x^2}$ should be:
$$-e^{-x^2}(\frac 1 {2x} + \frac 1 {2x^2}) +  \frac 3 2 (\ln|x^2| - x^2 + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{(-x^2)^k}{k k!}) + \frac {e^{-x^2}}{x^2}$$
However, I believe this evaluates to (when differentiated):
$$e^{-x^2} + \frac 2 x (e^{-x^2} + \frac{e^{-x^2}} x) - \frac {e^{-x^2}} {x^3}$$
I may have made an error in that calculation. Either I am close or I have errored in the final product. Either way, is this a valid method? If so, could someone point out my error? If not, what is the issue?","['calculus', 'integration']"

It is a competitive computer game, where you pick 1 out of more than 100 heroes and play against each other. For simplicity, let's stick to 3 heroes. For to learn how to play with every single hero, I like to pick one randomly at the start of every game. Playing with my friends, I was criticized for playing with heroes that I do not know. The question So I asked myself: What is the probability of getting a hero that I have not played before after $x$ games (and, as a consequence, encounter higher difficulty)? Small example Before the first game ($x=0$), the probability is $100$%. Then it gets difficult. Consider the following list of three heroes: $H = \{A, B, C\}$. Playing two games, these outcomes might occur: $E = \{$$AA$, $AB$, $BA$, $BB$, $AC$, $CA$, $CC$, $BC$, $CB$ $\}$ In the following cases the probability of a new hero in the third game is $1/3$ $AB, BA, CB, BC, AC, CA$ In the following cases the probability of a new hero in the third game is $2/3$ $AA, BB, CC$ For example, after $AA$ the heroes $B$ and $C$ will still be new. In contrast, after seeing $BC$ only $A$ would be new. My approach The probability of getting a new hero depends on the number of rounds played and the number of heroes available. There are 3 heroes in the easy example, in reality more than 100. Every hero has the same chance of being picked each game. So it could be the same for $x$ games in a row. I think of it as a kind of binomial distribution. But it's not about ""Prob. that a coin is head 5 out of 6 times"". It's about the probability that anyone of those who have never been selected in games before is now selected . How could one solve it?","['statistics', 'calculus', 'probability']"

How to prove combinatorially that $(n+2)\text{Cat}_{n+1}=(4n+2)\text{Cat}_n$ for this interpretation of Catalan numbers? For example, proof of this recurrence for triangulations of $(n+2)$-gon is described in Wikipedia : after choosing a side of $(n+3)$-gon and contracting corresp. triangle we get an $(n+2)$-gon with one (marked and) oriented edge — I want something like this. In principle, triangulations and non-crossing matchings are connected by a chain of bijections (e.g. matchings $\leftrightarrow$ balanced parentheses $\leftrightarrow$ binary trees $\leftrightarrow$ triangulations) and one can try to transfer the description from the previous paragraph via this chain. But this way quickly becomes too convoluted (for me, at least).","['catalan-numbers', 'combinatorics']"
624153,Questions about continuity and differentiability,"$\newcommand{\sgn}{\operatorname{sgn}}$
So i have couple of questions about differentiability and continuity. For example lets consider $f(x)=\sin(\frac1x)$. It is defined and continuous for $x\neq0$ . It's derivative is $\frac{-\cos(\frac1x)}{x^2}$. It looks to me that derivative is also continuous for $x\neq0$. Is that correct? If it is does, this means that $f(x)$ is defferentiable on $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, + \infty)$? I know that $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ because it is not defined there. Let's look now at function
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
|x|^p\sin(\frac1x) & \text{for }x\ne0, \\
0 & \text{for }x=0. 
\end{cases}
$$ Here are three questions: For which $p$ is $f(x)$ continuous? For which $p$ is $f(x)$ differentiable?  For which $p$ is $f'(x)$ continuous? Since $|x|^p\sin(\frac1x)$ for $x\neq0$ is product and composition of continous functions that are all defined for $x\neq0$, it follows that $f(x)$ is also continious for $x\neq0$. Let $p=0$. In that case for $x\neq0$ i get $f(x)=\sin(\frac1x)$. In that case $f(x)$ discontinous in 0, because $\lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\frac1x)$ is oscilatinge beetween $[-1, 1]$ and $f(0) = 0$. In other words $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)$ doesn't exist and it cant be fixed. Let  $p<0$. In that case for $x\neq0$ i get $f(x)=\frac{\sin(\frac1x)}{|x|^p}$. In that case $f(x)$ discontinous in 0, because $f(x)=\frac{\sin(\frac1x)}{|x|^p}$ is oscilatinge beetween $[-\infty,+ \infty]$ and $f(0) = 0$. In other words $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)$ doesn't exist and it cant be fixed. Let $p>0$. Since $f(x)$ =  $|x|^p\sin(\frac1x)$ for $x\neq0$ and it is product and composition of continious functions for $x\neq0$, this means that $f(x)$ =  $|x|^p\sin(\frac1x)$ is continious. Since $\lim_{x\to 0}|x|^p = 0$ and $\lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\frac1x) $ is oscilating between $[-1, 1]$, this means that  $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x) = 0$. Also $f(0)=0$, this means that f(x) is continious on whole $R$. Thus $f(x)$ is continuous for $p>0$. Next question is: for which $p$ is $f(x)$ differentiable? This is the question i am stuck on. I am assuming that it means differentiable on whole $R$ , if that's the case then answer is for $p>0$. $$f'(x) = \begin{cases} { p|x|^{p-1}\sin(\frac1x)\sgn(x) - \frac{|x|^{p-1}\cos(\frac1x)}{x^2}}& \text{for }x\neq0, \\ 0& \text{for }x=0 \end{cases}$$ Third question is: For which $p$ is $f'(x)$ continuous?. I tried home and it seems to me that for $p\leq1$  $\lim_{x\to 0}{ p|x|^{p-1}\sin(\frac1x)\sgn(x) - \frac{|x|^{p-1}\cos(\frac1x)}{x^2}}$ doesn't exist . For $p>1$ i don't know how to compute the limit. For lets say $p=3/2$ i get $f'(x) =  { p|x|^{\frac12}\sin(\frac1x)\sgn(x) - \frac{|x|^{\frac12}\cos(\frac1x)}{x^2}}$. While $p|x|^{\frac12}\sin(\frac1x)\sgn(x)$ goes to $0$ i dont know how to calculate $\frac{|x|^{\frac12}\cos(\frac1x)}{x^2}$, since it is undefined. Any help would be appreciated.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
624155,Evaluate $\int_A x^{-1}$,"We are asked to evaluate $\displaystyle \int_A x^{-1}dV(A)$, with $A=\{ (x,y):2<x+y<4,y>0,x-y>0\}$. From the solutions we know that$\displaystyle \int_A x^{-1}dV(A)=2Log(2)$. The point is to use the change of coordinates theorem to evaluate the integral. After proving that $\mathbf{g}(s,t)=(s^2+t^2,s^2-t^2)$ is regular (it's univalent only in each quadrant), I've tried computing $\displaystyle \int_B (s^2+t^2)^{-1}\cdot |det(D\mathbf{g}(s,t))|\text{ }dV(A)$, with $B=\{ (s,t):2<s^2<4,\text{ }s^2>t^2,\text{ and } |s|>|t| \}$.
