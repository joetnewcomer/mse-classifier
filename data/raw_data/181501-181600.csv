3309725,Volume Form induces Borel Measure Proof-Verification,"Proposition. Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold of positive dimension and $\omega$ a volume form on $M$ . Suppose that $F \in
\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ such that $F^*\omega = \omega$ . Then there
  exists a finite $F$ -invariant regular Borel measure on $M$ . Proof. Define $I \in (C^\infty(M))^*$ by $$I(f) := \int_M f\omega.$$ Because $C^\infty(M)$ is dense in $C^0(M)$ under the sup-norm, $I$ extends uniquely to an element of $(C^0(M))^*$ . By the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique finite regular Borel measure $\mu$ such that $$I(f) = \int_M fd\mu$$ for all $f \in C^0(M)$ . Thus left to show is $F$ -invariance, that is $$\mu(F^{-1}(A)) = \mu(A)$$ for all measurable $A \subseteq M$ or equivalently, $F_* \mu = \mu$ , where $F_*\mu$ denotes the pushforward-measure of $\mu$ under $F$ . By assumption, we have that $$I(f) = \int_M F^*(f\omega) = \int_M (f \circ F)\omega = I(f \circ F)$$ for all $f \in C^\infty(M)$ since $F^*\omega = \omega$ implies that $F$ is orientation-preserving. Thus also $$\int_M f d\mu = \int_M(f \circ F)d\mu$$ for all $f \in C^0(M)$ . The latter is exactly the integral $$\int_M f d(F_*\mu).$$ But then also $$I(f) = \int_M fd(F_*\mu)$$ for all $f \in C^0(M)$ which implies by uniqueness that $$F_*\mu = \mu$$ because $F_*\mu$ is also regular as $\mu$ is. $\square$ Is that proof correct? Is there a simpler argument?","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification', 'differential-geometry']"

3309813,Question on Proof of Atiyah-Macdonald Theorem 11.25,"Theorem 11.25 For any irreducible variety $V$ over $k$ the local dimension of $V$ at any point is equal to $\dim V$ . Proof: By the Normalization Lemma (Chapter 5, Exercise 16) we can find a polynomial ring $B=k[x_{1},\cdots, x_{d}]$ contained in $A(V)$ such that $d=\dim V$ and $A(V)$ is integral over $B$ ..... In this case $A(V)$ is the coordinate ring of a variety $V$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ . And $\dim V$ is defined as the transcendental degree of $k(V)$ , which is a field of fraction of $A(V)$ . Noether normalization lemma in this book is Noether's normalization lemma : Let $k$ be a field and let $A\neq 0$ be a finitely generated $k$ -algebra. Then there exists elements $y_{1},\cdots, y_{r} \in A$ which are algebraically independent over $k$ and such that $A$ is integral over $k[y_{1},\cdots, y_{r}]$ My question is, how can we say that $d= \dim V$ ? From the lemma, we know that there is such $k$ -algebra $B$ inside of $A(V)$ and $A(V)$ is integral over $B$ . Now, to show $d= \dim V$ , we need to show that transcendence degree of the field of fraction $k(V)$ is equal to that of $k(x_{1},\cdots, x_{n})$ , which is a subring. However, I don't know why this is true. Could you help me?","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
3309830,"Justifying the ""onion proof"" for circle area","I was, as we all were, exposed to the so-called ""onion proof"" in my first calculus course in high school. Courtesy of this shameless screengrab from wikipedia, the proof can be visualized by integrating across infinitely many, infinitely thin rings which can be approximated by rectangles of length $\ 2πt$ and width $\ dt$ . Now, how can we justify the approximation of the area bounded by the two circular arcs as a rectangle? Is it possible to show unequivocally that: $\ 2π(t-dt) \times dt$ < area of ring < $\ 2πt \times dt$ for instance, and then apply squeeze theorem as $\ dt$ goes to zero in the limit? I am aware that this approximation is connected to deeper facts about the Jacobian of a polar transformation, but I would like to prove the above inequality with as little machinery as possible (in order to avoid potential circularities in my logic...) If it is not possible to do so rigorously, this feedback would also be appreciated.","['calculus', 'geometry']"

The process which identifies the position of the particle is a Markov process.

3309984,Why does a Smooth Function on a Torus (resp. circle) have atleast $4$ (resp. $2$) Critical Points (without Morse Theory),"Here's the actual question I wish to prove, along with the given hint: Let $f: \Bbb{T}^2 \to \Bbb{R}$ be a smooth map. Show that $f$ has atleast $4$ critical points ( $p$ is a critical point of $f$ if the tangent map $Tf_p: T_p\Bbb{T}^2 \to T_{f(p)}\Bbb{R}$ vanishes). Hint: Parametrize $\Bbb{T}^2$ using angles $\theta,\varphi$ , and locate the maximum and minimum points of $f(\theta, \varphi)$ , for $\varphi$ fixed, say $(\theta_{\text{max}}(\varphi), \varphi)$ and $(\theta_{\text{min}}(\varphi), \varphi)$ ; now maximize and minimize $f$ as $\varphi$ varies. I took a look at this question , but the answer there makes use of Morse Theory, which I do not know. Definitions I'm working with: The definition of torus I'm working with is $\Bbb{T}^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ , and the definition of tangent space at a point $p$ of a manifold $M$ is defined to be the collection of equivalence classes of curves: \begin{align}
T_pM := \{[c] : \text{$c$ is a $C^1$ curve in $M$ with $c(0) = p$} \}.
\end{align} The tangent mapping is defined as $Tf_p([c]) = [f \circ c]$ . As stated, I found the problem slightly difficult, so instead I tried to solve a simpler problem in the hopes that I'd be able to generalize it. Since, $\Bbb{T}^2$ is a product manifold $S^1 \times S^1$ , I tried to prove the following assertion instead: Every smooth function $f: S^1 \to \Bbb{R}$ has atleast two critical points. I already have a proof of this fact using the Extreme value theorem (the extrema will then be critical points), but I want to prove this assertion in a manner suggested by the hint, so that I can generalize this simple case of $f: S^1 \to \Bbb{R}$ to the general case of $f: \Bbb{T}^2 \to \Bbb{R}$ . Here's what I have done so far. In trying to follow the hint, I considered the parametrization $\alpha^{-1}: (0,2 \pi) \to S^1 \setminus \{(1,0)\}$ defined by \begin{align}
\alpha^{-1}(\theta) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
\end{align} (I call it $\alpha^{-1}$ so that $(S^1 \setminus\{(1,0)\}, \alpha)$ is then a chart on $S^1$ ). Next, I managed to show that the point $\alpha^{-1}(\theta)$ is a critical point for $f$ if and only if $\theta$ is a critical point for $f \circ \alpha^{-1}: (0,2 \pi) \to \Bbb{R}$ . In other words, if and only if \begin{align}
(f \circ \alpha^{-1})'(\theta) = \dfrac{d}{d\theta} \big( f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)  \big) = 0 \tag{$*$}
\end{align} Now, here's the problem I face: the only thing we know about $f$ is that it is a smooth function $f:S^1 \to \Bbb{R}$ , but we don't have an explicit formula for it. Also, $f$ is a function whose domain is the manifold $S^1$ , rather than an open set in $\Bbb{R}^2$ , so I can't apply the standard chain rule to $(*)$ . Because of this I'm not sure how to proceed in proving that there exist atleast two critical points for $f$ . (Also, I think I might have to use a second chart so that it covers the entire circle, but I'm having trouble with the first chart itself, so I didn't bother with a second chart). So, my questions are: Is it a good idea to try to solve my general problem by considering the lower dimensional case of $f:S^1 \to \Bbb{R}$ ? If so, how would I prove the existence of two critical points in the $S^1$ case (without extreme value theorem), and how would I generalize this to prove existence of $4$ critical points for $f: \Bbb{T}^2 \to \Bbb{R}$ ? If this isn't a viable approach, how would I make use of the hint given in the question to directly prove the existence of $4$ critical points?","['smooth-functions', 'smooth-manifolds', 'maxima-minima', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

3310040,Metric of spacetime with zero speed of light,"Despite references to physical spaces, this question is purely mathematical on differential geometry. While deriving coordinate transformations based on common assumptions of homogeneity and uniformity of space and time (see A Primer on Special Relativity or Nothing but Relativity ), typically three logical options are considered: Finite speed of light - Minkowski spacetime. Infinite speed of light - Galilean spacetime, ruled out by observation. Imaginary speed of light (negative square) - Euclidean spacetime, ruled out by causality. There exist however the forth logical option: Zero speed of light. At first it appears unreal, but in fact there exists a conceptual case asymptotically close to this scenario. Imagine a thin spherical shell approaching its Schwarzschild radius. Spacetime inside this empty shell is locally flat Minkowski with the same time dilation as at the shell. As the shell approaches an infinite time dilation at the Schwarzschild radius, the speed of light at and inside the shell approaches zero. What is the metric structure of this space in the limit of the speed of light being exactly zero? Metrics for other three cases are well known. The Euclidean and Minkowski metrics don't require an introduction. The Galilean structure is described here: What is a mathematical definition of the Maxwellian spacetime? Would the $c=0$ spacetime collapse simply to a 3D Euclidean space with no time or would it have two separate metrics for space and time like the Galilean spacetime?","['metric-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"

3310229,"Find the inverse of the integral transform $ S_n\{f\}=\int_{0}^1f(x)x^{n}\,dx$","Let $S$ denote the integral transform that maps every function $f$ integrable on (0,1) to a sequence $\left(S_n\{f\}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ : $$S:f\mapsto \left(S_n\{f\}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\text{ defined by: } S_n\{f\}=\int_{0}^1f(x)x^{n}dx$$ Note that it's quite similar to the Mellin transform , whose expression is $$M\{f\}(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)x^{s-1}dx$$ the differences being that for $S$ the integration is over $(0,1)$ instead of the whole real axis, and the transformed function is taken only on the integers instead of the real numbers so that it defines a sequence and not a proper function. My question is, wether it is possible to determine under what conditions $S$ is injective, and more importantly an expression if its inverse transform $S^{-1}$ that would enable us to recover $f$ from the sequence $S_n\{f\}$ . In the case of the Mellin transform, we know that under certain conditions the inverse Mellin transform is defined and thus we can recover the original function from its transformed with the formula: $$M^{-1}\{\varphi\}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-i\infty}^{i\infty}\varphi(s)x^{-s}ds$$ Because of the similarities between $S$ and the Mellin transform, I thought this might help, but it didn't lead me anywhere so far. In case $S^{-1}$ cannot be expressed explicitely, then I'd like to study the case where of a continuous variable $s$ instead of a discrete variable $n$ (i.e $S$ maps a function to another function, and not a sequence): $$S'\{f\}(s)=\int_{0}^1f(x)x^{s}dx$$ Of course, the invertibility of $S$ and $S'$ are not equivalent.

If $\nu$ is a Borel probability measure on $X$ and $\nu(\{j\})=0$ for every $j\in X$ then $\nu$ is the Dieudonne measure. Which is the same as saying that $\nu(K)=1$ for every uncountable compact $K$ . I find this hard to believe. Stuck at home right now with no access to the paper; anyone have a hint? A brief reminder re the Dieudonne measure: Say $M_1$ is the class of all $E\subset X$ such that $E\cup\{\omega_1\}$ contains an uncountable compact set; let $M_0=\{X\setminus E:E\in M_1\}$ and $M=M_1\cup M_0$ . Then $M$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra containing every Borel set (hint: it's clear that $M$ contains every compact set); noting that $M_1\cap M_0=\emptyset$ we define the Dieudonne measure $\lambda$ on $M$ by $$\lambda(E)=\begin{cases}1,&(E\in M_1),\\0,&(E\in M_0).\end{cases}$$ See for example  Exercise 18 in Chapter 2 of Rudin Real and Complex Analysis ...","['measure-theory', 'ordinals']"

3310719,Codimension one foliations induced by a map to the circle.,"Let $M$ be a closed connected $n$ -manifold. If there exists a submersion $p:M\to S^1$ , then $p$ is both proper and onto (since $M$ is compact and $S^1$ is connected). Therefore, by Ehresmann's theorem, $p$ is a fiber bundle and $M$ admits a codimension one foliation. In particular, the ""easy"" Thurston's theorem (the easy implication I mean) implies that $M$ has Euler characteristic zero (see here for example). I am interested in the converse of this proposition: If $M$ be a closed connected $n$ -manifold with Euler characteristic $0$ , is there always a submersion $$M\longrightarrow S^1~?$$ If $M$ has Euler characteristic $0$ the hard implication of Thurston theorem says that there is a codimension 1 foliation on $M$ . Of course this foliation doesn't have to be induced by a submersion to the circle (the leaves could be non compact), but maybe there is another foliation on $M$ coming from a submersion to the circle. There should be some obvious counter examples but I can't find one. If there are indeed counter examples to this statement,  I'd be happy to know if they are counter examples where $M$ admits a flat metric, that is Is there a closed connected $n$ -manifold $M$ which admits a flat metric (and hence $\chi(M)=0$ by Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem ) such that there is no submersion $M\to S^1$ ?

3310749,Eliminating unwanted branches of algebraic curves related to triangle centres,"Lately I have become fascinated with triangle centres . To that end, I have written a small Python module that can compute explicit positions of centres for arbitrary triangles in the plane to arbitrary precision, based on the trilinear and barycentric coordinates in Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC). For certain combinations of triangles and centres, the sum of barycentric coordinates evaluates to $0$ and I have a point at infinity. To study those cases where a triangle centre leaves the friendly confines of the Euclidean plane for the line at infinity, I invented the notion of infinity curves. The infinity curve $\infty_n$ associated with the Kimberling triangle centre $X_n$ is the locus of points $(x,y)$ with $y\ne0$ and $(x,y)\ne(0,\pm\sqrt3)$ where the centre $X_n$ of the triangle with vertices $(-1,0),(1,0),(x,y)$ is a point at infinity. $\infty_n$ may be empty; I will ignore these cases here, as well as points that always lie on the line at infinity such as $X_{30}$ . For algebraic centres, which make up the vast majority of centres in the ETC, the associated infinity curves are also algebraic, and the problem then is to find an exact bivariate polynomial describing them. They can be derived by setting the sum of barycentric coordinates equal to zero, then expanding, simplifying and factoring. For example, the Exeter point $X_{22}$ has triangle centre function $a(b^4+c^4-a^4)$ , from which I derived $$\infty_{22}(x,y):3x^4 + 2x^2y^2 - 6x^2 - y^4 - 6y^2 + 3=0$$ Infinity curves can be visualised (or determined not to exist) for a given centre by making a complex plot of the centre's location for the triangles $(-1,0),(1,0),(x,y)$ with varying $z=x+yi$ . Here is such a plot for $X_{22}$ ; the infinity curve is white and marks discontinuities in the hue. The file infcurves has polynomials describing infinity curves up to $X_{70}$ (also the upper limit of the centres that can be computed by the Python module at the time of posting this question). However, I have been unable to fully reduce some of the polynomials to match the real appearance of their corresponding curves, and this is why I ask this question. Take for example $X_{29}$ with centre function $\frac{\sec A}{\cos B+\cos C}$ . Its complex plot looks like this, the infinity curve being a simple W-shape on the upper half-plane: The polynomial I have computed as $\infty_{29}$ , on the other hand, produces that and more: $$27 x^{16} + 144 x^{14} y^{2} - 216 x^{14} + 306 x^{12} y^{4} - 864 x^{12} y^{2} + 756 x^{12} + 324 x^{10} y^{6} - 1404 x^{10} y^{4} + 2160 x^{10} y^{2} - 1512 x^{10} + 171 x^{8} y^{8} - 1180 x^{8} y^{6} + 2430 x^{8} y^{4} - 2880 x^{8} y^{2} + 1890 x^{8} + 36 x^{6} y^{10} - 540 x^{6} y^{8} + 1480 x^{6} y^{6} - 1800 x^{6} y^{4} + 2160 x^{6} y^{2} - 1512 x^{6} - 132 x^{4} y^{10} + 530 x^{4} y^{8} - 600 x^{4} y^{6} + 270 x^{4} y^{4} - 864 x^{4} y^{2} + 756 x^{4} - 16 x^{2} y^{12} + 92 x^{2} y^{10} - 124 x^{2} y^{8} - 140 x^{2} y^{6} + 324 x^{2} y^{4} + 144 x^{2} y^{2} - 216 x^{2} + 4 y^{10} - 37 y^{8} + 116 y^{6} - 126 y^{4} + 27=0$$ This curve appears to be decomposable into four parts, one of which is the one I want. The problem is that the polynomial is absolutely irreducible, something I have checked with my implementation of Gao's factorisation algorithm (one of whose steps I inquired about in this question ). I want to eliminate the unwanted branches of this curve, but factoring does not seem to be the way.

$$ Valuation . In addition, the functional $E_D[F]$ is a valuation on $M$ . By this I mean  that if we cover $M$ by submanifolds $U, V \subset M$ , i.e., $M = U \cup V$ , such that $U \cap V$ is also submanifold of $M$ . Then we can compute $E_D[F]$ by considering the following maps: $$
F|_U:U \to N,
$$ $$
F|_V:V \to N,
$$ $$
F|_{V\cap U}:V\cap U \to N.
$$ Then $$
E_D[F] = E_D[F|_U] + E_D[F|_V] - E_D[F|_{V\cap U}].
$$ Rigid deformation in-variance Let $V$ be a smooth vector field on $N$ , we can use $V$ to define, for each point $p \in N$ , an integral curve $\gamma:[0, b] \to N$ , which is the curve on $N$ characterized by the property $$
\gamma(0) = p, 
$$ $$
\gamma'(t) = V_{\gamma(t)},~~t \in [0, a].
$$ Roughly, all of the integral curves of $V$ define a flow $\Theta_V: N \times [0, a] \to N$ of $V$ on $N$ . With the help of integral curves, we can now make sense of what we mean by applying $V$ to $N$ ( $V$ acts on $N$ ). This can be interpreted as mapping each point $p\in N$ by the flow of $V$ . Which in turn means  that we are moving each point along the integral curve of $V$ for some time $t \in [0,a]$ . So that for a fixed $t \in [0,a]$ we have $$
\Theta_V^{(t)}: N \to N,
$$ we can now make sense of composition $\Theta_V^{(t)} \circ F: M \to N$ , and compute Dirichlet energy of this composition: $$
E_D[\Theta_V^{(t)} \circ F]. 
$$ Dirichlet energy has this property, that if the Vector field $V_K$ is Killing vector field (this is specific field that preserves the Riemannian metric $g$ , i.e., for Lie derivative we have $\mathcal{L}_V g = 0$ and therefore Killing vector field defines isometric transforms of $N$ ) we have: $$
E_D[F] = E_D[\Theta_{V_K}^{(t)} \circ F].
$$ Reiterating my question, I want now to consider the family of all functionals that have the listed property and understand if they all have the form $(**)$ , more generally if one can write them as an integral with those other density.

3310945,About the implication of $\epsilon>0$ being arbitrary.,"It is indeed a very basic question. I always read proofs stating that since $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary, then some inequality holds. Also, I've been accepting it without problems. Now, I just figured out that this point is not completely clear to me. For example: as $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary, we have that $f(x)>z-\epsilon \implies f(x)\geq z$ (I will be more specific here) Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function, $z\in\mathbb{R}$ a given point and assume $\forall \epsilon>0, [f^{-1}(z-\epsilon,z+\epsilon)]^c=\{x\in \mathbb{R}:\mid f(x)-z\mid \geq \epsilon \}:=A_{\epsilon}$ is countable (on a crazy topology on domain called co-countable). I want to show that as $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary then actually all $\mathbb{R}$ without the point $x:f(x)=z$ is countable (again, $\mathbb{R}$ together with the crazy co-countable topology). Looking at $\{x\in \mathbb{R}:\mid f(x)-z\mid \geq \epsilon \}$ if $f(x)=z$ were possible, $0\geq \epsilon>0$ which is a contradiction. Both assertions are acceptable to me, but I can't just put (intuitively) $\epsilon=0$ and infer the results. How would you properly argue it?","['self-learning', 'analysis']"
3310968,Gradient of the Sinkhorn Distance for Regularized Optimal Transport,"Given two probability measures $\mathbf{r}\in \Sigma_n$ and $\mathbf{c}\in \Sigma_n$ , Cuturi 2013 [1] defines the Sinkhorn distances as: $$
d_{\mathbf{M},\alpha}(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{c}) = \min_{\mathbf{P} \in U_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{c})} \langle \mathbf{P}, \mathbf{M} \rangle
$$ where the cost matrix $\mathbf{M}$ defines the underlying metric space, and $U$ depicts the set of transportation plans: $$
U_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{c}) = \{\mathbf{P}\in U(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{c}) \,:\, D_{\text{KL}} (\mathbf{P} || \mathbf{r}\mathbf{c}^\top) \leq \alpha \}
$$ $D_{\text{KL}}$ refers to the KL-divergence and $\alpha$ controls the regularization. In practice $d(\cdot)$ can be computed efficiently by considering the dual problem. The algorithm looks like: Essentially, I would like to minimize energies that involves Sinkhorn distances, such as: $$
\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{r}\in \Sigma_n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^k d_{\mathbf{M},\alpha}(\boldsymbol{r}, \mathbf{c}_i)
$$ This is only one example. Though, to this aim, I would need the gradient of the Sinkhorn distance w.r.t. the empirical measures, e.g. $\nabla_{\mathbf{r}} d_{\mathbf{M},\alpha}$ and $\nabla_{\mathbf{c}} d_{\mathbf{M},\alpha}$ . Using [2] (Proposition 1 and 2), I have hunch that the gradient w.r.t. $\mathbf{r}$ would read: $$
\nabla_\mathbf{r} d_{\mathbf{M}}^\lambda = -\frac{\log(\mathbf{u})}{\lambda}+\frac{\log(\mathbf{u})^\top\mathbf{1}_n}{\lambda n}\mathbf{1}_n
$$ where $d_{\mathbf{M}}^\lambda$ refers to the dual problem that is equivalent to the primal $d_{\mathbf{M},\alpha}$ , and the pair $(\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^n_+,\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{R}^n_+)$ is computed through the Sinkhorn matrix scaling applied to $K=\exp(-\lambda \mathbf{M})$ .
The term on the right hand side is used to normalize the gradient to keep it in the tangent bundle of the simplex. Does that mean that the gradient w.r.t. $\mathbf{c}$ would be: $$
\nabla_\mathbf{c} d_{\mathbf{M}}^\lambda = -\frac{\log(\mathbf{v})}{\lambda}+\frac{\log(\mathbf{v})^\top\mathbf{1}_n}{\lambda n}\mathbf{1}_n

3311654,Orthogonality in complex numbers geometry,"Under the standard definition of the inner product as: $⟨(w_1,...,w_n),(z_1,...,z_n)⟩=w_1 \bar z_1 +···+w_n\bar z_n$ What does it mean when $⟨(w_1,...,w_n),(z_1,...,z_n)⟩=0$ ?
For real vectors it means that there is a right angle between the two vectors in space they are in. On the complex place, however, there is a different interpretation of this as (1,0) can be multiplied by $i$ to get to (0,1). So we have a rotation operation that can be linearly multiplied. For two complex 1-d vectors to be orthogonal: $(a+bi)(c-di)=0$ $(ac+bd)+i(ad-bc)=0$ $ac+bd=0$ and $ad-bc=0$ We have real parts( $a$ ) interacting with complex(like $adi$ ) and vice versa. So what does orthogonality mean geometrically here? I'm sure its different that the real case. Here is a quote from an answer I found very interesting: If ${\bf x}={\bf a}+{\bf b}i$ , ${\bf y}={\bf c}+{\bf d}i$ in $C^n$ ,
  define vectors ${\bf u}=({\bf a},{\bf b})$ , ${\bf v}=({\bf c},{\bf
 d})$ , ${\bf w}=(-{\bf d},{\bf c})$ in $R^{2n}$ .  Then $$
         {\bf x}\cdot {\bf y} = {\bf u}\cdot {\bf v}+i{\bf u}\cdot {\bf w}  $$ so the real and imaginary parts of ${\bf x}\cdot {\bf y}$ have
  exactly  the geometric interpretations you are familiar with,  as
  applied to ${\bf u}$ , ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf w}$ , where ${\bf w}$ is a
  rotation of ${\bf v}$ . Source: interpretation of dot product of complex vectors Why does $w$ need to be such? Bonus Questions

3311793,What is the optimal way to wash a dirty vessel with a fixed amount of water and time?,"This question came up for me as I was trying to wash out some milk from my toddler's cup with a bottle of water that I had in my car. I do this every day -- drive him to school while he drinks milk, and then wash out his sippy cup as much as possible so that it's clean for him to use in the afternoon when I pick him up. Imagine that I have a sippy cup that when filled with a liquid and poured out, is left with volume $\mathit{D}$ of that liquid stuck to the inside. To start with, this is milk -- I've poured out as much milk as I can, but $\mathit{D}$ milk is still stuck to the inside of the cup. I have a finite amount $\mathit{W}$ of clean water, and a integer number of operations $\mathit{T}$ which is the number of different ""pour in a quantity of clean water, shake the cup to mix up the milk with the water, and pour out the washing liquid"" operations I can perform in the time that I have. Every time I pour in water, shake up the cup, and pour out the water, the same volume $\mathit{D}$ of this mixture sticks to the inside of the container. This volume $\mathit{D}$ is a property of the container. This means that no matter how many times I pour in water, shake, and pour out, there will always be some amount of milk left in the container (which can approach zero as the amount of water and the number of washings approaches infinity). Assume that each mixing operation mixes the remaining milk perfectly with the water that's introduced. Doing this in my car, I was torn between two ideas. One theory is to pour in very small amounts of water at the beginning, to waste the smallest amount of water when the cup is at its dirtiest. The other theory is to use large amounts of water up front, to get the bulk of the milk out early, and use the final washings to get the cup as clean as possible. I was unable to intuit which theory was more correct. Mathematically, what strategy minimizes the milk remaining in the container after $\mathit{T}$ washings? After these $\mathit{T}$ washings, how much milk remains in the milk-water mixture stuck to the inside of the cup? Thanks very much for your help!

3311941,Does every manifold admit a *flat* Riemannian metric?,"It is well-known that every smooth manifold $M$ admits a Riemannian metric, and the construction is straightforward. Let $\left\{U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha\right\}$ be a smooth atlas on $M$ admitting a partition of unity $\left\{\psi_\alpha\right\}$ . On each coordinate chart $U_\alpha$ , we can define a Riemannian metric $g_\alpha$ locally by setting $g_\alpha = \phi_\alpha^*\overline g$ , where $\overline g$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb R^n$ . Using the partition of unity, we can construct a global Riemannian metric by setting $g = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha g_\alpha$ . My first question is: Is this metric flat? I believe the answer is no. A metric is flat iff for each point there is a coordinate chart that is locally isometric to Euclidean space. However, it is not obvious to me that the above constructed metric is isometric to Euclidean in the overlaps of different coordinate charts. A counter-example to this could be $M = \mathbb R^2$ , and your atlas could be $U_1 = \mathbb R^2$ , $\phi_1 = \mathrm{Id}$ , and $U_2 = \left\{ (x,y) : x > 0\right\}$ , $\phi_2(x,y) = (\log x, y)$ , with partition of unity $\psi_1 \equiv \psi_2 \equiv \frac 1 2$ . Since $\phi_2^* \overline g = x^{-2} dx^2 + dy^2$ , the metric you would get from this patching in the right half-plane would be $g = \frac 1 2 \left(1+x^{-2}\right)dx^2 + dy^2$ , which is clearly not flat. My second question is: Given an atlas $\{U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha\}$ of a smooth manifold $M$ , does there exist a Riemannian metric on $M$ for which every chart $\phi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb R^n$ is a local isometry? This question seems harder to answer, and it seems unlikely, but an obvious counter-example to this eludes me.

3312058,The largest equilateral triangle circumscribing a given triangle,"Seven years ago, one of my many contributions to the March 2010 edition of Erich Friedman's Math Magic was a packing of eight circles of unit diameter and one equilateral triangle of unit side length into as small a circle as I could manage. To minimise the bounding circle's radius $r$ , I had to determine the largest equilateral triangle externally tangent to the three circles adjacent to it, then numerically adjust $r$ until said triangle had side lengths $1$ . This is not a trivial problem, and back then I did trial and error in GeoGebra. ( $2r=3.4133707107\dots$ ) It is easy to see that the circles can be shrunk and the equilateral triangle enlarged about its centre while preserving tangencies, so the problem is equivalent to finding the largest equilateral triangle $\Delta^*$ where each edge is incident to one of $A,B,C$ where $A,B,C$ are the circle centres. The following construction doesn't count since one edge does not meet $\triangle ABC$ : Now, having reinvigorated my interest in triangles, I believe I have found a construction for $\Delta^*$ for arbitrary $A,B,C$ , and am asking here for a more traditional proof of its optimality. My construction proceeds as follows: Construct the first isogonic centre/Fermat point of the triangle, $X_{13}$ in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC). That is, construct outward equilateral triangles $A'BC, AB'C, ABC'$ on the sides of $\triangle ABC$ , then $X_{13}$ is the concurrence of $AA',BB',CC'$ . $\Delta^*$ is (conjecturally) the antipedal triangle of $X_{13}$ . $^\dagger$ That is, $\Delta^*$ is the triangle formed by perpendiculars at $A,B,C$ of $AX_{13},BX_{13},CX_{13}$ respectively; it is guaranteed to be equilateral because the lines meeting at $X_{13}$ are evenly spaced around it. The centroid of the triangle thus constructed is $X_{5463}$ in the ETC, the reflection of $X_{13}$ in the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ , and its area is $\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2\sqrt3}+2\operatorname{area}(\triangle ABC)$ where $a,b,c$ are the side lengths. (Alternatively, the area is $2\left(1+\frac{\cot\omega}{\sqrt3}\right)\operatorname{area}(\triangle ABC)$ where $\omega$ is the Brocard angle.) How can I prove that my construction actually produces $\Delta^*$ , the largest circumscribing equilateral triangle? $^\dagger$ Without loss of generality, assume $AB$ is the largest side, and let $P,Q$ be the midpoints of $AC',BC'$ respectively. If $\overline{CP}$ or $\overline{CQ}$ is less than $\frac12\overline{AB}$ , my construction will not produce an equilateral triangle actually incident to all of $A,B,C$ . In that case, $\Delta^*$ has a side collinear with the triangle's shortest side $s$ and one vertex coincident with the original triangle's smaller angle incident to $s$ . If $A,B,C$ are circle centres in a packing problem, this means that a larger equilateral triangle can be drawn by introducing a point contact.","['area', 'geometry', 'packing-problem', 'triangles', 'optimization']"
