766597,Transverse intersection in a compact manifold,"Is it true that if $M$ is a compact manifold and $X,Y$ are submanifolds of $M$ which intersect transversely that the intersection $X\cap Y$ consists of finitely many points? I'm trying to understand a proof of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem which, so far as I can tell, makes implicit use of this fact. My immediate impression is that the answer is yes because otherwise what good is compactness here? I'm trying to prove it by arguing that if there were infinitely many points of intersection then there would be an open cover with no finite subcover and I keep getting stuck. Is there a better way to proceed or is the result simply wrong? I don't necessarily need a full proof; a yes or no and if yes a push in the right direction would be more than appreciated already.","['differential-topology', 'intersection-theory', 'compactness', 'differential-geometry']"
766629,Embedding as a subgroup,"Suppose I am given two finite groups $G$ and $H$ (not too large: let's say their orders are around $10000$ and $100$ respectively, and the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$).  These may be represented as groups of permutations with known, fairly small, sets of generators.  I would like to find, if possible, a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to $H$.  And if this is not possible, I'd like to find a subgroup $K$ of $G$ with a homomorphism of $H$ onto $K$ having as small a kernel as possible.

766659,How can the winding number change under a holomorphic map?,"This question comes from an old complex analysis qual.  First denote $\mathbb{C}^{\times} = \mathbb{C} \backslash \{ 0 \}$, $u = \{ e^{it} : 0 \leq t < 2 \pi \}$, and let $f : \mathbb{C}^{\times} \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ be some holomorphic function.  Then the winding number
$$ \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{f(u)} \frac{dz}{z} $$
can take any integer value depending on $f$ (by letting $f(z) = z^n$, for example).  However, if we change the domain and codomain of $f$ to something like $\{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \frac{1}{4} < |z| < 4 \}$, then we can't use those $f$'s we used before.  The winding number can still be $1$ of course by using the identity.  I see that it can also be $0$ by letting $f(z) = 1$.  We can also get the winding number to be $-1$ by setting $f(z) = z^{-1}$.  Can we get the winding number to be $2$?  I suspect not but am having trouble showing it.  Thoughts?",['complex-analysis']
766662,Prove that local connectedness is preserved by continuous closed functions,"I thought about applying the proof for open functions, namely: Proposition: If $f$ is a continuous open function from a locally connected space $X, \tau$ onto a space $T, \tau'$, then $Y$ is locally connected. Proof: Suppose $y \in Y$ and $U$ is any neighborhood of $y$. Since $f$ is onto, there is $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Then $f^{-1}(U)$ is a neighborhood of $x$. Since $X$ is locally connected, there is a connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$. Since $f$ is both continuous and open, $f(V)$ is a connected neighborhood of $y$ with $f(V) \subset U$. Therefore $Y$ is locally connected. I want to apply this somehow, but I can't figure out a way how. I think that we could try to apply components to this. Components are closed, but if we have local connectedness then we know they're clopen, which means we might be able to travel along the function through the open attribute, and then claim something about being closed. That being said, the problem is we assume we have a continuous closed function. Yeah, pretty stuck on this.","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

766739,Area interpretation of integrals,"When integrating under part of a circle, as in $$A=\int_0^a {\sqrt{r^2-x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x}$$ I noted that the simple geometric solution would be to add the areas of the sector and triangle formed by this shape (see picture below): $$A=[\text{sector}]+[\text{triangle}]=\left[{1\over 2}r^2\sin^{-1}{a\over r}\right]+\left[{1\over 2}a\sqrt{r^2-a^2}\right]$$ To perform the integration I would write $x=r\sin\theta,\;\mathrm{d}x=r\cos\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta$ to get $$A=\int_0^{\sin^{-1}(a/r)}{r^2\cos^2\theta\;\mathrm{d}\theta}$$ Now using the double-angle formula, we have $$A={1\over 2}r^2\int_0^{\sin^{-1}(a/r)}{\big(1+\cos 2\theta\big)\;\mathrm{d}\theta}={r^2\over 2}\left[\theta+{1\over 2}\sin 2\theta\right]\Biggr|_0^{\sin^{-1}(a/r)}$$ and this is the same as before: $$A={r^2\over 2}\left[\sin^{-1}{a\over r}+{a\over r}\sqrt{1-{a^2\over r^2}}\;\,\right]$$ I was highly intrigued at how the substitution actually broke the definite integral into exactly the same pieces that I broke it into to use geometry. What is the meaning of this? Also, on (perhaps) a related note, why is it that $$\int_0^{2\pi}{\sin^2 x\;\mathrm{d}x}=\pi$$ is the area of the unit circle? The fact that the parameter goes from $0$ to $2\pi$ makes me think this must have some simple area interpretation, but I can't find what it would be.","['definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'area']"
766755,Algorithm to find primes up to $n$ in $O\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$?,"Consider the problem of given an integer $n$, generating a list of the primes not greater than $n$. An optimized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes can do such task in $O(n)$, while the more modern Sieve of Atkin can do it in $O\left(\frac{n}{\log\log n}\right)$. (In both cases I assume that integer operations (sum, multiplication, modulo...) can be done in $O(1)$). My first question is: Are asymptotically better algorithms currently known? Now, concerning lower bounds on such an algorithm. Of course we need at least $\frac{n}{\log\,n}$ operations (because this is asymptotically the number of primes up to n). So: Are there any reasons or heuristics that indicate whether an algorithm that does so in $O\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$ should or should not exist? Of course $O\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$ should be really hard to achieve by traditional sieve methods, that usually involve writing down the numbers of a set asymptotically greater than the primes, and then sieving the non primes (I can't even think of an ""easy to compute"" set with size $O\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$ that contains the primes). But can a more convincing heuristics or at least an absurd implication of the existence of such an algorithm be given?","['prime-numbers', 'algorithms', 'number-theory']"

Prove:  $GL(n,\mathbb{R})/SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^*$. Attempt: We can define a surjective homomorphism 
$f: GL(n,R) \to \mathbb{R}^*$. Let $f(A) = \det(A)$. Then
$$
f(AB) = \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) = f(A)f(B)

so $f$ is a group homomorphism. And it is surjective since any $r \in \mathbb{R}^*$ is in the image of $f$ since $1/\det A$ is in $\mathbb{R}^*$. We need to show $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is the kernel.

|e^{z^2}| \le e^{|z|^2}
$$ As far as my attempt goes, I simplified $ |e^{z^2}| $ to $ |e^{x^2-y^2}| $ which I then stated was less than or equal to $ e^{z^2} $ to get rid of the modulus. Not knowing what to do there, I decided to try to simplify the right term somehow.  All I managed was to square the z, but I couldn't think of a useful way to simplify it further. $ e^{|x^2-y^2+2ixy}| $ So I tried to prove that $ x^2-y^2 \le |x^2-y^2+2ixy| $, but I'm not sure if that would be considered proper.  After that, I figured I would show that, by definition, $|x^2-y^2+2ixy|$ would be $ x^2-y^2 \le ((x^2-y^2)^2+(2xy)^2)^{(1/2)} $.  Squaring both sides, it would end up as $ x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^2 \le x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^2 $, which would be always true, since x and y are real numbers and they're all being raised to even powers.

I am however in general clueless on how to show that a function is differentiable. Of course there is always the brute force way such as computing the Jacobian-Matrix and discuss its entries, however that might be a little bit difficult with the above mapping since $f: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, that would be one hell of a matrix to compute. I found that most people enjoy working with this definition of differentiability in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $f(x)=f(x_0)+A(x-x_0)+\|x-x_0\|\alpha (x)$ where $\alpha: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\lim\limits_{x \to x_0} \alpha (x)=0$ and $A$ is a linear function. I understand that the above is only a slight variation of: Def : $f$ is at $x_0$ differentiable $\iff \exists A: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n: \displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)-f(x_0)-A(x-x_0)}{\|x-x_0\|}=0 $ In C.T. Michaels Analysis II the author mentions that by the definition nothing is known about the linear mapping $A$, however in most cases $A$ can easily be found by computing the Jacobian-Matrix and then verifying the definition with that Matrix. I have read a couple of entries on this website where people attempt to show that a function is differentiable or not at some generic point. But to be honest it all seemed a bit like Voodoo-Magic to me. Question : I am not primarily interested in the solution to this exercise but in the thought process one would have to show that $f$ defined as above is differentiable: Where do you start?

My Answers:
a) For $a_0$, there is 0 ways to deposit 0 dollars in the machine because since it is 0 dollars, you cannot put in any money to come up with that value. So, $a_0$= 0 For $a_1$, there are 2 ways, you can put in 1 of one dollars coins and 1 of one dollar bill. So $a_1$ = 2. For $a_2$, there are 3 ways, you can put in 2 of 1 dollar bill, 2 of 1 dollar coin and 1 of dollar coin and 1 dollar bill.

The first proof uses a lot of advanced topics in modular forms, but I'm interested in the second proof.
It is left as exercise at the end of the first chapter and it seems to use only elementary instruments. There are four steps in this proof, I need help to solve the following: Define 
$$j:\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ as the function that sends $\tau \in \mathbb{H}/SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ in the $j$-invariant of the torus $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$, where $\Lambda_{\tau}$ is the lattice $\mathbb{Z}+\tau\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{C}$.

and $\partial F_H$ its boundary with counterclockwise orientation.
Suppose furthermore $j(\tau) \neq j_0$ on $\partial F_H$. Prove that $$\lim_{H \rightarrow +\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial F_H} \frac{j'(\tau)}{j(\tau)-j_0}d\tau=1$$ The autor suggest to use the following property of the function $j$ 
$$j(\tau)=j(\tau+1)=j(-1/\tau)$$

Now if $m$ and $n$ are both negative, then $g^m=(g^{-m})^{-1}$ by definition and we also know $$(g^{-m})^{-n}=g^{mn}$$ since all exponents are positive in this equation. Therefore $$(g^m)^n=((g^{-m})^{-1})^{n}=((g^{-m})^{-1})^{-1(-n)}=((g^{-m})^{-1(-n)})^{-1}=((g^{mn})^{-1})^{-1}=g^{mn}$$
Last part of the equation from the fact of unique inverses in groups. Also not sure on this step. Now if $m<0$ and $n$ positive then we know $$(g^{-m})^{n}=g^{-mn}$$ since all the exponents are positive.

EDIT 1 Using the generating function of $\phi_{n}(x)$ : $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\phi_{n}(x)}{n!}t^{n}=\exp\left[x\left(e^{t}-1 \right ) \right ]$$ We have: $$\frac{\phi_{m}(x)}{m!}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\exp\left[x\left(e^{e^{it}}-1 \right ) \right ]e^{-imt}dt$$ Now, for a suitable choice of the domain of integration $I$ , we put: $$\int_{I}\frac{\phi_{m}(x)\tilde{\phi}_{n}(x)}{m!}dx=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{I}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\tilde{\phi}_{n}(x)\exp\left[x\left(e^{e^{it}}-1 \right ) \right ]e^{-imt}dtdx$$ And we get orthogonality by requiring : $$\int_{I}\tilde{\phi}_{n}(x)\exp\left[x\left(e^{e^{it}}-1 \right ) \right ]dx=e^{int}$$ Or, by a suitable choice of the branch cut of $\log$ : $$\int_{I}\tilde{\phi}_{n}(x)\exp\left[x\left(z-1 \right ) \right ]dx=(\log z)^{n}$$ EDIT 2 We use the integral representation of the gamma function to obtain: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{a}e^{-sx}dx=\frac{\Gamma(a+1)}{s^{a+1}}\;\;\;\;\Re(s)>0$$ Thus: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\log x \right )^{n}e^{-sx}dx=\lim_{a\rightarrow 0}\frac{d^{n}}{da^{n}}\frac{\Gamma(a+1)}{s^{a+1}}=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}(\log s)^{k}$$ Therefore, there exist nth order polynomials in $\log x$ , that we'll denote by $f_{n}(x)$ , such that: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)e^{-sx}dx=\frac{(\log s)^{n}}{s}$$ Now we put $s=e^{z}$ , and obtain: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}f_{n}(x)e^{-x(e^{z}-1)}dx=e^{-z}z^{n}$$ Or: $$\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x}f_{n}(x)\frac{\phi_{m}(-x)}{m!}z^{m}dx=e^{-z}z^{n}$$ This is the closest i got !","['orthogonal-polynomials', 'hilbert-spaces', 'complex-analysis']"

Ten for any choice of $A,B\in\mathbb R\cup\{\pm\infty\}$ such that $A\le B$ there exists a sequence $\varepsilon_n$ such that each $\varepsilon_n\in\{\pm1\}$,

\limsup\limits_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^n \varepsilon_k a_k=B.$$ In the other words, this says how we can change the behavior of the series by changing the signs of the terms of the series. Sketch of the proof. We choose two sequences such that $A_n\to A$, $B_n\to B$. We construct the sequence $\varepsilon_n$ in blocks. In the first block we choose $\varepsilon_k=1$ and we stop at the first $n_0$ when $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_1} \varepsilon_ka_k > A_1$. The second block will have negative signs, and we stop when $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_2} \varepsilon_k a_k < B_1$. By induction we can continue in choosing blocks with $+1$'s and $-1$'s like this. (I.e. we always have $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_{2l-1}} \varepsilon_ka_k > A_l$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_{2l}} \varepsilon_ka_k < B_l$; moreover, the numbers $n_l$ are always chosen in the $l$-th step of the construction as the minimal possible number with these properties.) The divergence of the original series is used to get that each block ends somewhere. The fact that $a_n\to0$ is used to get that the values of $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ are indeed $A$ and $B$. $\hspace{2cm}\square$ I think that this result is occasionally useful.
