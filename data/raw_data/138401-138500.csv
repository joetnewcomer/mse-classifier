2215764,Problem in set theory where elements of a set are geometrical figures.,"I am facing a problem in analyzing sets having their elements as geometrical figures like triangles, rectangles or circles. May be it is because I have not studied advanced geometry but still I want to know how shall I approach questions like these. My book asks me to find whether set of all triangles in a plane is a subset of set of all rectangles in that plane. First I thought that it is not. But then I thought that both the sets would be infinite ( there can be infinite rectangles or triangles in a plane. Also all such triangles could be a part of rectangles and vice versa. So I am stuck whether it is a subset or not. Another question which is brief but vital for me is that what universal set would we choose for the set of all equilateral triangles in a plane. I thought about this and concluded that as triangles are merely a collection of points, then the universal set we should chose should be set containing all the points in a Euclidean plane. But I thought it may be also wise to choose set of all triangles as universal set. So what it would be ? It also leads me to another question that whether a set can have more than one universal sets and if not how are they chosen ? I'm sorry that I am putting all these questions together here but I found them related and relevant to be put together. Also I may be wrong somewhere and I want you let me know it as I am only a beginner now. Thanks for your help .","['euclidean-geometry', 'elementary-set-theory', 'geometry']"

2215781,Can a row of five equilateral triangles tile a big equilateral triangle?,"Can rotations and translations of this shape perfectly tile some equilateral triangle? I've now also asked this question on mathoverflow . Notes: Obviously I'm ignoring the triangle of side $0$ . Because the area of the triangle has to be a multiple of the area of the tile, the triangle must have side length divisible by $5$ (where $1$ is the length of the short edges of the tile). The analogous tile made of three equilateral triangles can tile any equilateral triangle with side length divisible by three. There is a computer program, Burr Tools , which was designed to solve this kind of problem. Josh B. has used it to prove by exhaustive search that there is no solution when the side length of the triangle is $5$ , $10$ , $15$ , $20$ or $25$ . Lengths of $30$ or more will take a very long time to check. This kind of problem can often be solved be a colouring argument but I've failed to find a suitable colouring. (See below.) Lee Mosher pointed me in the direction of Conway's theory of tiling groups . This theory can be used to show that if the tile can cover an equilateral triangle of side length $n$ then $a^nb^nc^n=e$ in the group $\left<a,b,c\;\middle|\;a^3ba^{-2}c=a^{-3}b^{-1}a^2c^{-1}=b^3cb^{-2}a=b^{-3}c^{-1}b^2a^{-1}=c^3ac^{-2}b=c^{-3}a^{-1}c^2b^{-1}=e\right>$ . But sadly it turns out that we do have that $a^nb^nc^n=e$ in this group whenever $n$ divides by $5$ . In fact one can use the methods in this paper of Michael Reid to prove that this tile's homotopy group is the cyclic group with $5$ elements. I think this means that the only thing these group theoretic methods can tell us is a fact we already knew: that the side length must be divisible by $5$ . These group theoretic methods are also supposed to subsume all possible colouring arguments, which means that any proof based purely on colouring is probably futile. The smallest area that can be left uncovered when trying to cover a triangle of side length $(1,\dots,20)$ is $($ $1$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $1$ $,\,$ $5$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $5$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $5$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $4$ $,\,$ $6$ $,\,$ $5$ $)$ small triangles. In particular it's surprising that when the area is $1\;\mathrm{mod}\;5$ one must sometimes leave six triangles uncovered rather than just one. We can look for ""near misses"" in which all but $5$ of the small triangles are covered and in which $4$ of the missing small triangles could be covered by the same tile. There's essentially only one near miss for the triangle of side $5$ , none for the triangle of side $10$ and six ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) for the triangle of side $15$ . (All other near misses can be generated from these by rotation, reflection, and by reorienting the three tiles that go around the lonesome missing triangle.) This set of six near misses are very interesting since the positions of the single triangle and the place where it ""should"" go are very constrained.","['discrete-geometry', 'tiling', 'geometry', 'combinatorics', 'group-theory']"

However, although Wolfram Alpha does also not seem to be able to either to compute a general antiderivate or compute the above expression for general $n \in \mathbb N$, it will yield (after possibly some refreshing) an explicit value for any $n$ I've tested so far (all $n$ between $1$ and $15$).

2215888,Non-backtracking closed walks and the Ihara zeta function (Updated with partial attempt),"For a connected $d$-regular graph $G=(V,E)$ with adjacency matrix $A$, we defined a sequence of matrices
$$A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$$
defined using powers of $A$ inductively as follows:
$$A_0=I$$
$$A_1=A$$
$$A_2=A^2-dI$$
For $k \geq 3$,
$$A_{k}=A_{k-1}A-(d-1)A_{k-2}$$
Just like $(A^k)_{v,w}$ counts the number of walks on $G$ from $v$ to $w$, the value $(A_k)_{v,w}$ counts the number of walks on $G$ from $v$ to $w$ without backtracking.
The recurrence relation above can be used to easily show that the ordinary (matrix) generating function for the above sequence is
$$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{\infty} t^k A_k = (1- t^2)I. \left( I-tA + (d-1)t^2 I \right)^{-1}$$
With some abuse of notation, we can rewrite this generating function as
$$\frac{1-t^2}{I-At+(d-1)t^2}$$ On the other hand, the Ihara zeta function of the graph $G$ is given by
$$\zeta_G(t) = exp \left( \sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty} N_k \frac{t^k}{k} \right)$$
where $N_k$ is the number of closed non-backtracking walks on $G$ of length $k$. It is known that $\zeta_G(t)$ has an alternate expression using determinants as
$$\zeta_G(t) = \frac{(1-t^2)^{|V|-|E|}}{det(I-At+(d-1)t^2)}$$ My question is: can the determinant formula for the Ihara zeta function be derived from the generating function for the matrices $A_k$? What exactly is the relationship between $A_k$ and $N_k$? A similar question has been asked here How to get from Chebyshev to Ihara? and I have also been trying out ideas from here Proof of 2 Matrix identities (Traces, Logs, Determinants) But I am not interested in the Chebychev polynomial connection here: just whether the generating function can be manipulated using logarithms and traces to obtain the expression for the zeta function. Thanks. UPDATE:
Here's a partial attempt of mine. Using Chebychev polynomials of the second kind defined as 
$$U_0(x)=1$$
$$U_1(x) = 2x$$
and for $k \geq 2$,
$$U_k(x) = U_{k-1}(x)U_1(x) - U_{k-2}(x)$$
and with generating function
$$\sum \limits_{k=0}^{\infty} U_k(x)t^k = \frac{1}{1-2xt+t^2}$$
we can express the matrix $A_k$ as
$$A_k = (d-1)^{k/2} U_k \left( \frac{A}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right) - (d-1)^{k/2-1} U_{k-2} \left( \frac{A}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right)$$
and so
$$Tr(A_k) = (d-1)^{k/2} \sum \limits_{i=0}^{n-1} U_k \left( \frac{\mu_i}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right) - (d-1)^{k/2-1} \sum \limits_{i=0}^{n-1} U_{k-2} \left( \frac{\mu_i}{2 \sqrt{d-1}} \right) $$
where 
$$d=\mu_0 \geq \mu_1 \geq \dots \geq \mu_{n-1} \geq d$$
are the $n$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$. Thus we have an expression for the trace of $A_k$ as a polynomial in the eigenvalues of $A$. In a similar way, working backwards fro the definition of the Ihara zeta function, we can define another matrix sequence $B_k$ as follows: 
$$B_1=A$$
$$B_2 = A^2-dI$$
and for $k \geq 3$,
$$B_k = \begin{cases}
B_{k-1}A - (d-1)B_{k-2} - (d-2)A & \text{ if k is odd}\\
B_{k-1}A - (d-1)B_{k-2} + d(d-2)I & \text{ if k is even}
\end{cases}$$
Just like $A_k$ could be expressed in terms of Chebychev polynomials $U_k$ of the second kind, the matrices $B_k$ can be expressed using Chebychev polynomials $T_k$ of the first kind defined by the recurrence
$$T_0(x)=1$$
$$T_1(x)=x$$
and for $k \geq 2$,
$$T_k(x)=2xT_{k-1}(x)-T_{k-2}(x)$$ 
The expression for $B_k$ is
$$B_k=\begin{cases}
2(d-1)^{k/2}T_k \left( \frac{A}{2\sqrt{d-1}} \right) & \text{ if k is odd}\\
2(d-1)^{k/2}T_k \left( \frac{A}{2\sqrt{d-1}} \right)+(d-2)I & \text{ if k is even}
\end{cases}$$ All this is simply by reverse engineering the expression for the Ihara zeta function to obtain $N_k$ as the trace of some matrix. My question now, modulo correctness of my calculations, is whether the matrices $B_k$ as defined above have any natural interpretation in terms of walks on the graph.","['graph-theory', 'zeta-functions', 'algebraic-graph-theory', 'generating-functions', 'linear-algebra']"

2215914,"Which outcome is more likely, getting four kings within 2x cards or a specific pair of triples (from a group) within x cards?","Suppose 2 people (call them A and B) challenge each other to a card game. A fair, well shuffled, standard 52 card deck is used for each hand. Community (shared) cards are drawn one at a time without replacement for each hand.  Player A will win if all four Kings are drawn in a hand.  Player B will have a candidate win if a pair of triples are drawn from the following ranks (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) in a hand.  Since it is more likely that B will encounter a candidate win before A wins, both players agree that even if B gets a candidate win (let's say for example with 20 cards drawn so let n = the number of cards drawn for B to have the first candidate win of the hand), community cards will continue to be drawn for that hand until either twice as many cards are drawn and there is no win for A, or A has a win before 2n cards are drawn. For example: Let's suppose player B gets a candidate win early in the hand at the 10th drawn card (not likely but good to keep this example short).  The drawn cards could be something like this: 3 5 K 7 5 J K 3 3 5.  Here B has a candidate win with 333 and 555 but the rules of the game state that A has a chance to win by getting the 4 Ks within twice the number of cards drawn when B gets the first candidate win (in this example twice 10 cards = 20 cards).  So for example, if drawn cards 11 thru 15 were 9 2 K Q K, then A would actually win because A's win was in 15 cards and B's candidate win was in 10 cards and 15 is less than double of 10.  In this case, B's candidate win would lose. So there will be a winner every hand. So the question is who will win in the longrun based on the given rules?  How do you compute this mathematically?  That is, how do you determine the average number of cards for each player to get a candidate win and if we apply these rules of the game, who should win in the longrun? For clarification, note that quads of ranks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10 are still considered triples.  So (for example), B can still have a candidate win if cards 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 are drawn somewhere in the hand before seeing quad Ks.  The last card of rank 3 here might be drawn as we are drawing more cards to see if A will have a win within the allowed # of cards.  Also, even if more than a 2 occurrences of triples in ranks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,and 10 show up, that is still considered a candidate win for B.  For clarity, think of the first pair of triples seen (in ranks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) as the start of the candidate win for B (taking note of how many cards were drawn up to that point), and as we draw more cards to see if A wins or not, other triples that come up will not nullify the candidate win that B already has. Also, in the rare case where the four Ks appear before player B gets the 2 occurrences of triples, the hand would stop immediately since that is clearly a win for player A. For clarity I should also mention that quads in ranks 2..10 are still considered a candidate win for B such as if cards 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 are seen before the 4 Ks are seen.  This is because once a triple in ranks 2..10 is seen, it retains the triple ""status"" (for the purpose of this game), even though it may later turn into a quad during that same hand. Also note that the minumum # of drawn cards for A to win is 4 (KKKK) but the minimum for B to win is 12 (such as 3 5 3 5 3 5 7 K 8 K 9 K).  Even though B has the candidate win at drawn card 6 in this example, we have to allow 12 drawn cards total to ensure there is no win by A within the 12 total cards.","['probability', 'card-games']"

The course notes are based on Do Carmo's book. It introduces many objects without any motivation or intuition. Also on the internet I can't find any decent references explaining the things I need (the best I found is probably the book of Lee: An introduction to curvature). Below I list some of my questions, I hope they will also help other students with the same problem as me. The following questions are based on the equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci: $\textbf{1)}$ What is the motivation which Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci had when deriving their formulas? Why do we precisely look at the objects appearing in these equations? At first sight it seems to me that many other relations could be derived. What makes these equations so special? $\textbf{2)}$ What is the meaning of $[A_{\xi}, A_{\eta}] =A_{\xi}A_{\eta} - A_{\eta}A_{\xi}$?
Where $A_{\eta}$ is the shape operator in the direction of the normal vector $\eta$. $\textbf{3)}$ If we have an immersion $f:M^n \rightarrow \overline{M}^{n+1}$ and denote by $\nabla^{\perp}_X Y$ the normal connection. At page 135 of Do Carmo's book he starts with investigating the properties of $\nabla^{\perp}_X \eta$ where $\eta$ a normal vector field along $M$. For regular surfaces $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, this normal part is zero since the image of the differential of the normal map lies completely in the tangent space of $M$. So what information are we hoping to get when studying this object? $\textbf{4)}$ What does the normal curvature 
$$R^{\perp}(X,Y) \xi = \nabla^{\perp}_X \nabla^{\perp}_Y \xi - \nabla^{\perp}_Y \nabla^{\perp}_X \xi-\nabla^{\perp}_{[X,Y]} \xi$$

(Inputs are $n\in \mathbb N$) One additional condition is that its output is either $0$ or $1$. I need it be ""algebraic"" and by that I mean that: It is written down using only ""numbers"" ( no trigonometric functions or limits for example ) You can only use operations: $+, -, \times, \div, x^t$ ( where $x^t$ stands for raising numbers to rational exponents ), also absolute value $|x|$ is allowed in the form of $\sqrt{x^2}$ It contains a finite number of terms. Constructions I suspect that the function should have a  template like: $$f(n)=\frac{1+(-1)^X}{2}$$ Where $X$ is the rest of the function. ( This is just for readability ) For period $P=2$, I'll write $f_2(n)$, then $$X=n$$ This yields: $0,1,0,1,0,1\dots$ For period $P=4$, I'll write$f_4(n)$, then $$X=(1-(\sqrt{-1})^n)^4$$ Which yields $0,0,0,1\dots$ repeating.

2216209,Optimal time to renew a library book,"A real world word problem from my life: I often check out books and DVDs from my local library. The standard check-out period is three weeks. Using the library's website, I can renew any checked out item at any time before it's due to extend the due date to three weeks after the time of renewal. I am allowed to renew an item twice before I must return it. This encourages me to renew items only when they are near their due dates so that I can get the maximum amount of time with my items before running out of renewals. However, the rule is I can't renew an item if another library patron places a hold on it. If someone does, I must return the item by its current due date. This encourages me to renew items early before anybody has a chance to place a hold on it. So if I renew too early, I won't extend the initial three week check-out period by very much. If I renew too late, my item has a greater chance of acquiring a hold, in which case I won't extend the initial check-out period at all. So that leads to the following question: When during a given three week check-out period is the best time for me to renew an item so that I can keep the item for the longest possible time with the lowest risk that a hold will be placed on it before I can renew? I suppose we may assume the probability on any given day that a checked-out item of mine will get a hold placed on it is constant and independent of which day it is during the three week period. Beyond that I have no idea what the actual value of that probability is, except that I know from experience that, for a popular item, it is pretty likely that a hold will get placed on it within, say, $10$ days after I check it out. I'd be interested if anyone can answer my question in general where the probability per day of a hold is $p$. Intuitively, if $p$ is small, then I should renew late; if $p$ is large, then I should renew early. Additionally, I'm also interested if anyone can offer some good estimates of what $p$ might actually be either using my own (very rough) description, or their own experience or analysis.","['discrete-optimization', 'probability', 'optimization']"

I would prefer not to be given an answer directly, and am looking for more of an indication as to whether I am on the right track. The problem with the courses I am working with is that they only show examples, and do not explain exactly how it ""works"". Given $l_1 = (6,-1,0)+t(3,1,-4)$ and $l_2 = (4,0,5)+s(-1,1,5)$ find
  the intersection of $l_1$ and $l_2$. First I took $d_1 = (3,1,-4)$ and $d_2 = (-1,1,5)$, Then I made sure that they did not have the same ratio. (if they have the same ratio this would indicate that they are either coincident or parallel) they do not have the same ratio, so they either intersect at a point or are skew. Then I made parametric equations: $l_1:$ $$\begin{align}
x & = 6 + 3t\\
y & = -1 + t\\
z & = -4t\\
\end{align}$$ $l_2:$ $$\begin{align}
x & = 4 - s\\
y & = s\\
z & = 5 + 5s\\
\end{align}$$ Then I equated them to eachother: $$\begin{align}
6 + 3t & = 4 - s\\
-1 + t & = s\\
-4t &= 5 + 5s\\
\end{align}$$ I moved the unknowns to one side: $$\begin{align}
3t + s & = -2 \qquad & \text{(we'll call this equation $1$)}\\
t - s & = 1 \qquad & \text{(we'll call this equation $2$)}\\
-4t - 5s & = 5 \qquad & \text{(we'll call this equation $3$)}\\

But I I take equation $(2)$ and $(3)$, the left and right hand sides do match, and then if I go to find the point of intersection I get decimal values for coordinates (why would that be the case?)

I thought maybe by constructing a homomorphism $\theta:(\mathbb{Z} / p^{k-1}\mathbb{Z})^\times \to (\mathbb{Z} / p^k\mathbb{Z})^\times$, where $\theta(n) = n^p$, I could use the order-preserving property of $\theta$ to get that $O_{p^k}(n^p) = O_{p^{k-1}}(n)$, then use that to get that the LHS of the desired relation divides the RHS. After that, maybe another homomorphism in reverse to get the other division?

Included was that I had to start with a Fourier series for the function $f:\Re \to \Re: x \mapsto \sin(x)$ for $x\in[0, \frac{\pi}{2}[$, so let's start with that. Let 
\begin{eqnarray*}
g(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_k\cos(4kx) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_k\sin(4kx).
\end{eqnarray*} 
This is the Fourier series for $f$.
With $a_k = \frac{4}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin(x)\cos(4kx)dx$ and $b_k = \frac{4}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin(x)\sin(4kx)dx$. Solving this leads to (or at least I found that): $a_k = \frac{4}{(1-16k^2)\pi}$, $b_k = \frac{16k}{(1-16k^2)\pi}$ for $k\geq1$ and $a_0 = \frac{4}{\pi}$. Bringing this to $g(x)$ gives:
\begin{eqnarray*}
g(x) = \frac{2}{\pi} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{4}{(1-16k^2)\pi}\cos(4kx) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{16k}{(1-16k^2)\pi}\sin(4kx). 
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $f(x) \approx g(x)$, we can say that $f(0) = g(0)$. We get 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin(0) = \frac{2}{\pi} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{4}{(1-16k^2)\pi}\cos(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{16k}{(1-16k^2)\pi}\sin(0),
\end{eqnarray*}
this becomes 
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 = \frac{2}{\pi} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{4}{(1-16k^2)\pi}.
\end{eqnarray*}
We get 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{-2}{\pi} = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-16k^2}
\end{eqnarray*} so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-16k^2} = \frac{-1}{2}.
\end{eqnarray*} We need the sum from k = 0. The term $\frac{1}{1-16k^2}$ for k = 0 gives 1, so we add 1 to both sides. This leads to my solution 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-16k^2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{eqnarray*} However, when approaching this sum numerically and using Wolfram, I find that the sum should be $\frac{4+\pi}{8}$. Could some help and point out where I went wrong with my approach? Thanks in advance","['real-analysis', 'fourier-series', 'sequences-and-series']"

If $\mathscr F$ is a quasicoherent sheaf on $X$ (so $\pi_*\mathscr F$ is quasicoherent as well), we get a natural map $H^i(Y,\pi_*\mathscr F)\to H^i(X,\mathscr F)$. He leaves this as an exercise for the reader, and I'm trying to prove it. The natural thing to do would be to define a chain map between the complexes we use to calculate the cohomologies. So if $\{U_1,\dots,U_n\}$ is an affine cover of $Y$, letting $U_I=\cap_{i\in I}U_i$ for $I\subseteq[n]$, we can write $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ as a finite union $V_{i1}\cup\cdots\cup V_{im_i}$ of affine schemes. Therefore if we let $S=\{(i,j):1\le i\le n,1\le j\le m_i\}$, then we see that $\{V_{ij}:(i,j)\in S\}$ is an affine open cover of $X$. The complexes have the form $$0\to\prod_{|I|=1\\ I\subseteq[n]}\pi_*\mathscr F(U_I)\to\prod_{|I|=2\\ I\subseteq[n]}\pi_*\mathscr F(U_I)\to\cdots\\
0\to\prod_{|J|=1\\ J\subseteq S}\mathscr F(V_J)\to\prod_{|J|=2\\ J\subseteq S}\mathscr F(V_J)\to\cdots$$ However, I don't see a ""natural"" way to define a chain map here. The differential is defined using the restriction maps coming from $U_{I\cup\{j\}}\hookrightarrow U_I$, but in the case above, $\pi^{-1}(U_I)$ is in general going to be larger than $V_J$ where $|I|=|J|=1$.

Writing $gf$ instead of $g\circ f$ , we can say that by the formula for $f_k(a+v)$ given before, that, from differentiability of $g$ in $b=f(a)$ and that for al v\in U_0$, we have: $$gf(a+v) = g(b+w) = g(b) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial g}{\partial y_k}\cdot \beta_k + \sigma\cdot |w|$$ where $\sigma = \sigma(v)$ is a continuous real function in $0$ , which anihilates in $v=0$ .

In category-theoretic language, this means that $\langle x_1,x_2,\dotsc \mid R_1,R_2,\dotsc \rangle$ represents the functor $\mathsf{Grp} \to \mathsf{Set}$ which maps $G$ to the set of all families of elements $(g_1,g_2,\dotsc)$ in $G$ satisfying the relations $R_1(g),R_2(g),\dotsc$ in $G$. Problem: I don't see how one comes up with the functor above from the universal property formulation of group , i.e. how did it make the deduction ""In category-theoretic language, this means..."" ? Sure we can define a functor (as my attempt below); but how did we even think of that?  Sorry if this is obvious, I am quite new to Category Theory. (Is this right?): This functor $F: \mathsf{Grp} \rightarrow \mathsf{Set}$, satisfies $F(A) := A'$, where $A'$ is as described in the OP. Now let $f:A \rightarrow B$ be a homomorphism. If $\{ x_1, \ldots, x_n, \ldots \}$ satisfies relations, then $\{ f(x_1, \ldots, f(x_n), \ldots \}$ satisfies relations in $B$ ($f$ is homomorphism). Hence, define $F(f)(\{a_i \}) := \{f(a_i) \}$ for all $\{a_i \} \in A'$, and $F$ satisfies axioms of functor.","['category-theory', 'universal-property', 'group-theory', 'group-presentation']"

What is the approach I have to use? Does someone know how to solve it? Unfortunately I didn't find anything in the literature but I hope this community will surprise me. EDIT: From this point on I continued thanks to Kiryl Pesotski's suggestion. If we apply the substitution $z=e^{-\gamma x}$, we have that:
$$\frac{d}{dx}y(x)=\frac{dz}{dx}\frac{d}{dz}y(-\log(z)/\gamma)=-\gamma e^{-\gamma x}\frac{d}{dz}y(-\log(z)/\gamma)=-\gamma z \frac{d}{dz}y(-\log(z)/\gamma)$$
where, for simplicity, we can rename $y(-\log(z)/\gamma)$ as $y(z)$. Then:
$$\frac{d^2}{dx^2}y(x)=\frac{dz}{dx}\frac{d}{dz}\left(-\gamma z y'(z)\right)=\cdots =\gamma^2 z(y'(z)+zy''(z))$$
The ode becomes:
$$z^2 y''(z)+\frac{1}{\gamma}zy'(z)\left(\gamma-a_1-a_2z\right)+\frac{1}{\gamma^2}y(z)(b_1+b_2z+b_3z^2)=0$$
Now I exploit the second suggestion because I am supposed to get an hypergeometric equation. The substitution $y(z)=x^{-\frac{\gamma-a_1}{2\gamma}}e^{-\frac{a_2}{\gamma^2}}g(\xi)$ with $\xi=\sqrt{\frac{b_1+\gamma^2}{\gamma^2}-\frac{b_3}{\gamma^2}}z$ has the following first derivative:
$$\frac{d}{dz}y=\frac{1}{\gamma z}\frac{\gamma-a_1}{\gamma}x^{-\frac{\gamma-a_1}{2\gamma}-1}e^{-\frac{a_2}{\gamma^2}}g(\xi)+x^{-\frac{\gamma-a_1}{2\gamma}}e^{-\frac{a_2}{\gamma^2}}g'(\xi)\sqrt{\frac{b_1+\gamma^2}{\gamma^2}-\frac{b_3}{\gamma^2}}$$

2217785,Proof of this fairly obscure differentiation trick?,"Suppose we're tying to differentiate the function $f(x)=x^x$. Now the textbook method would be to notice that $f(x)=e^{x \log{x}}$ and use the chain rule to find $$f'(x)=(1+\log{x})\ e^{x \log{x}}=(1+\log{x})\ x^x.$$ But suppose that I didn't make this observation and instead tried to apply the following differentiation rules: $$\frac{d}{dx}x^c=cx^{c-1} \qquad (1)\\ \frac{d}{dx}c^x = \log{c}\ \cdot c^x \quad (2)$$ which are valid for any constant $c$. Obviously neither rules are applicable to the form $x^x$ because in this case neither the base nor the exponent are constant. But if I pretend that the exponent is constant and apply rule $(1)$, I would get $f'(x)\stackrel{?}{=}x\cdot x^{x-1}=x^x.$ Likewise, if I pretend that the base is constant and apply rule $(2)$ I obtain $f'(x)\stackrel{?}{=}\log{x}\cdot x^x$. It isn't hard to see that neither of the derivatives are correct. But here's where the magic happens: if we sum the two “derivatives” we end up with
$$x^x+ \log{x}\cdot x^x=(1+\log{x})\ x^x$$
which is the correct expression for $f'(x)$. This same trick yields correct results in other contexts as well. In fact, in some cases it turns out to be a more efficient way of taking derivatives. For example, consider $$g(x)=x^2 = \color{blue} x\cdot \color{red} x.$$ If we pretend the blue $\color{blue} x$ is a constant we would get $g'(x)\stackrel{?}{=}\color{blue}x\cdot 1=x$. Now if we pretend the red $\color{red}x$ is constant we get $g'(x)\stackrel{?}{=}1\cdot \color{red} x=x$. Summing both expressions we end up with $2x$ which is of course a correct expression for the derivative. These observations have led me to the following conjecture: Let $f(x,y)$ be a differentiable function mapping $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}.$ Let $f'_1 (x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,y)$ and $f'_2 (x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y} f(x,y)$. Then for any $t$ we have: $$\frac{d}{dt}f(t,t)=f'_1 (t,t) + f'_2 (t,t).$$ (I apologise for the somewhat awkward notation which I could not seem to get around without causing undue ambiguity.) This formulation also seems to lend itself to following generalisation: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function differentiable in each of its variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N$. For $n=1,2,\ldots,N$ define $f'_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N)$. Let $t$ be any real number and define the $N$-tuple $T=(t,t,\ldots,t)$. Then one has: $$\frac{d}{dt} f(T)=\sum_n f'_n(T).$$ Thus my question is: Is this true? How can it be proven? (Specifically in the case $N=2$ but also in the general case.)","['calculus', 'vector-analysis']"
2217791,Count valid colourings on an hexagonal grid,"Tile the infinite plane with hexagons. Colour the hexagons black or white in any way you like, provided there is no line of three hexagons all the same colour. How many such colourings are there? Obviously the answer is infinite. It increases exponentially with the area covered by the hexagons. My question is: how fast? An altenative way to express the answer is in bits per hexagon, i.e. how much binary data can I store per hexagon on average. No triangles Note that three hexagons sharing a vertex cannot all be the same colour, otherwise there will be a line of three somewhere nearby. Lower bound Colour the hexagons red, green and blue such that neighbouring hexagons are coloured differently (this colouring is unique up to reflections). Then recolour the red ones black, the green ones white, and the blue ones at random. This always gives a legal colouring. Not all legal colourings are of this special form. However, just considering colourings of this special form, the information density is $1/3$ (in bits/hexagon). This gives a lower bound on the true information density. Upper bound Cut the plane into parallel strips, each two hexagons wide. Colour each strip independently of the others, avoiding lines of three and triangles. Then put them back together. All legal colourings can be made in this way. Not all colourings made this way are legal. However, considering all such colourings, the information density is about 0.551. This gives an upper bound on the true information density. The figure of 0.551 can be computed by considering adding one hexagon at a time to the end of a semi-infinite two-wide strip.
