681175,Radon-Nikodým (write the density as a limit),"Let $\mu$ be a probability measure and $\nu$ a $\sigma$-finite measure on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ with $\nu\ll\mu$. Show that it is $\mu$-a.s. $$
\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\nu [x-h,x+h)}{\mu [x-h,x+h)}=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}(x).
$$ I do not have many ideas... Set $f:=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}$. Then $\nu [x-h,x+h)=\int_{[x-h,x+h)}f\, d\mu$ and $$

681183,Prove that a series is $O(t^a)$.,"Consider the series
$$ u(t,x) = \sum_{i \geq 1} {u_i(x) t_1^i } + \sum_{i+2j \geq k+2, j\geq 1} {\varphi_{i,j,k}(x) t_1^i t_2^j y^k} $$
where $t \in \tilde{\mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0 \}}$, $x$ is complex $n$-dimensional, and 
$$t_1 = t, t_2 = t^{\rho(x)}, y = \log t.$$
$\rho (x) $ is some given function, $\log$ is the natural logarithm, and $\tilde{\mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0 \}}$ is the universal covering space of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. Assume that the coefficients are holomorphic on the same disk. It is known that $u$ converges on the region
$$ \{(t,x) : |t_1| < \epsilon, |t_2 | <\epsilon , |yt_1|<\epsilon, |y^2 t_2| <\epsilon, |x_i| < r\ (i =1,...,n) \}.$$ I want to show that 
$$ \max_{x \in K} |u(t,x)| = O(t^a)$$
as $t$ tends to zero in $S_\theta := \{t : |\arg t|<\theta \}.$ What I have so far: Take $r_1 > 0, r_2 > 0, r_3 > 0,$ and $r_4 > 0$ so that $r_1 < \epsilon, r_2 < \epsilon, r_3 r_1 < \epsilon, r_3^2 r_2 <\epsilon$ and $r_4 < r$ hold. Then $u$ is now convergent on the region
$$ \{(t_1, t_2 , x, y) : |t_1| \leq r_1 , |t_2| \leq r_2, |y| \leq r_3, |x_i| \leq r_4\ (i=1,...,n) \}.$$
We can get Cauchy's estimates for the coefficients as follows: For some $M$,
$$ |u_i (x) | \leq \dfrac{M}{r_1^i} \qquad \text{and} \qquad |\varphi_{i,j,k} (x) | \leq \dfrac{M}{r_1^i r_2^j r_3^k}$$
on $D(r_4) := \{x : |x_i| \leq r_4\ (i=1,...,n) \}.$ There, any help - hints, suggestions on how to proceed, results that can be used - would be appreciated. Thank you!","['asymptotics', 'self-learning', 'complex-analysis', 'taylor-expansion']"

681226,Correlation Coefficient Distribution Function: An Apparent Discrepancy?,"I'd like to explain an apparent discrepancy between: (1) The sample correlation distribution function between sample vectors for a bivariate, correlated random variable (correlation coefficient = $\rho$) and (2) The sample correlation distribution function for two normally distributed random vectors that each contain a given signal with additive Gaussian noise. In this latter case, the correlation coefficient between these vectors $\rho$. While (1) gives the standard Pearson Correlation Coefficient, (2) is more consistent with time series analysis and match filtering/correlation detection. I'd like to use a distribution function for (2) to identify the detection performance of such a correlation detector. Please read on below. First sample correlation computation: The ""correct"" way to view the correlation distribution function is as follows: Suppose pairs $(x_{1}, s_{1})$, $(x_{2}, s_{2})$, $(x_{3}, s_{3})$, $\cdots$, $(x_{n}, s_{n})$ are a sample of size $n$ drawn from the distribution of the random vector $(S, \, X)^{\prime}$, which has a bivariate normal distribution with mean vector $(\mu_{S}, \, \mu_{X})^{\prime}$ and covariance: \begin{equation} 
\Sigma =  
\begin{bmatrix}
       \sigma_{S}^{2} & \sigma_{S\,X} \\[0.3em]
       \sigma_{S\,X} & \sigma_{X}^{2}            
     \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation} where the population correlation coefficient is: \begin{equation} 
\rho = \cfrac{\sigma_{S\,X}}{\sigma_{X}\, \sigma_{S}}
\end{equation} The estimator for $\rho$, call it $\hat{\rho}$, is: \begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{1}  
= \frac{ \boldsymbol{x}^{\text{T}} \boldsymbol{s} } { \left|\left|\, \boldsymbol{x} \,\right|\right| \,\left|\left| \,\boldsymbol{s} \,\right|\right| }
\end{equation} where $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{s}$ are concatenated $n$-dim vectors formed from from the samples $(x_{k}, s_{k})$ above ($k$ $=$ $1,2,\cdots,n$). Coefficient $\hat{\rho}$ has a Pearson's correlation coefficient distribution function, that I will call $p_{R}\left( r \,; \rho, n, \,\mathcal{H}_{1}\right)$. The expression $\mathcal{H}_{1}$ is borrowed from hypothesis decision theory. It indicates that the true correlation is nonzero, e.g., $\rho$ $\ne$ $0$. Second sample correlation computation: OK: Now take two vectors, $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{s}$. This time, assume: $\boldsymbol{x}$ $\sim$ $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{X}, \sigma_{X}^{2}\mathbf{I})$ and: $\boldsymbol{s}$ $\sim$ $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{S}, \sigma_{S}^{2}\mathbf{I})$ Again, compute the sample correlation distribution function: \begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{2}  
= \frac{ \boldsymbol{x}^{\text{T}} \boldsymbol{s} } { \left|\left|\, \boldsymbol{x} \,\right|\right| \,\left|\left| \,\boldsymbol{s} \,\right|\right| }
\end{equation} Suppose now that $\rho$ is the same in both cases . Inconsistency: These coefficients DO NOT have the same distribution functions. That is, the distribution function for $\rho_{1}$ and $\rho_{2}$ do not overlap. In fact, the latter is lower variance, and shifted to the right of the first. The following figure illustrates that while  $\rho_{1}$ has the ""expected"" Pearson correlation coefficient distribution (left panel), the second coefficient $\rho_{2}$ behaves as though it has more samples, and a higher correlation coefficient (right panel). A parameter fit for $\rho$ and $n$ using $p_{R}\left( r \,; \rho, n, \,\mathcal{H}_{1}\right)$ illustrates that the distribution for $\rho_{2}$ is parametrized differently (blue curve, right panel). Both $\rho$ and $n$ are larger than expected. My Question : Can we develop the correct distribution function for $\rho_{2}$? Or, can we ""correct"" $\rho$ and $n$ and simply use  $p_{R}\left( r \,; \rho, n, \,\mathcal{H}_{1}\right)$? To generate these figures, Matlab Code follows below: %NOTE!

What is $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{x=0}^{n-1} \frac{n-x}{n+x}$? I am fairly certain that the answer is $\infty$ because as $n$ gets closer to $\infty$ there are more terms that are very close to $1$ (if $n = 1,000,000$ then all the terms until $x = 5026$ are greater than or equal to $0.99$, and if $n = 1,000,000,000$ then you have to get to $x = 5025126$ for the terms to drop below $0.99$), but I don't know how to prove it.

681364,Curvature and the Arrow Pratt Absolute Risk Coefficient,"So I'm in my first year of grad school, and I'm taking a decision analysis course. One of the topics we're covering is risk aversion, and with that comes discussion of the Arrow Pratt Absolute Risk Aversion coefficient. I know that this coefficient is supposed to be a measure of the curvature of an individual's utility function; however, using the little bit I remember from differential geometry, the Arrow Pratt coefficient definitely is not equal to the standard geometric definition of curvature. My question is: how are the two definitions related? function definitions $u(x)$: this functions takes in a vector $x \in R^{n}$ and spits out a value $u(x) \in R$ $r(x)= \frac{-u''(x)}{u'(x)}$  (risk coefficient) $k(x) = \frac{|u'(x)|}{(1+(u'(x))^{2})^{3/2}}$ In class, we've been using utility functions that have a constant absolute risk version coefficient. So, I used the one given in class when toying around in Matlab. This function is: $u(x)=(\frac 4 3)(1-(1/2)^{x/50})$ Thus, $u'(x)= \frac {-(2*(1/2)^{x/50}\ln(1/2))}{75}$ $u''(x)= \frac{-((1/2)^{x/50}log(1/2)^2}{1875}$ And we have: $r(x) = \frac{-\ln(1/2)}{50}$ However, curvature is: $k(x) = \frac{1}{((4(\frac12)^{x/25}\frac{log(1/2)^2}{5625} + 1)^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{(.00034166(\frac12)^{x/50}+1)^{3/2}}$ So, clearly this line does not have constant curvature by the geometric definition. This is also obvious when looking at a graph of $u(x)$. So, I'm struggling to relate the two measures. Is Arrow-Pratt discussing the relationship between slope and curvature? Could someone help elucidate this. Thanks!","['economics', 'geometry', 'curvature', 'utility']"

However, I don't have any ideas of how to find the 3D points that are in my camera range.

681394,"Convergence almost everywhere implies convergence in measure, the proof thereof","Let $(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $f$ be measurable functions $(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)\longrightarrow (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$. The first part of Theorem 2.10 on page 20 of Stefan Grosskinsky's lecture notes says ""assume that $\mu(E) < \infty$, then if $f_n \rightarrow f$ almost everywhere then $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure"". I don't quite understand why we need $\mu(E) < \infty$. The proof given in there does indeed use $\mu(E) < \infty$. However, I seem to be able to find another proof that doesn't need to use it. I will first present (a slightly modified version of) the proof given by Prof. Grosskinsky below. Assume $f_n \rightarrow f$ almost everywhere and let $g_n = f_n - f$ for each $n$, we want to show that $g_n \rightarrow 0$ in measure. We need to show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, we have $\mu(|g_n| \geq \epsilon) \rightarrow 0$, or equivalently in the case $\mu(E) < \infty$, $\mu(|g_n| < \epsilon) \rightarrow \mu(E)$. Indeed, \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \mu(|g_n| < \epsilon) &\geq \mu\big(\bigcap_{m \geq n} \{|g_m| < \epsilon\}\big) \\ &\nearrow \mu\big(\bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcap_{m > N} \{|g_m| < \epsilon\}\big) \\ &\geq \mu \big(\bigcap_{q \in \mathbb{Q},\, q > 0}\bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcap_{m > N} \{|g_m| < \epsilon\}\big) \\ &= \mu(g_m \rightarrow 0) \\ &= \mu(E). \end{split} \end{equation*} I understand the proof above, but below I will present what seems to be a proof without resorting to $\mu(E) < \infty$. This proof directly shows, for all $\epsilon > 0$, that $\mu(|g_n| \geq \epsilon) \rightarrow 0$, as opposed to the proof above where we showed $\mu(|g_n| < \epsilon) \rightarrow \mu(E)$. \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \mu(|g_n| \geq \epsilon) & \leq \mu\big(\bigcup_{m \geq n} \{|g_m| \geq \epsilon\}\big)\\ &\searrow \mu \big(\bigcap_{N \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{m>N} \{|g_m| \geq \epsilon\}\big)\\ &\leq \mu\big(\bigcup_{q\in\mathbb{Q},\, q>0} \bigcap_{N \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{m>N} \{|g_m| \geq \epsilon\}\big)\\ &= \mu(g_m \nrightarrow 0)\\ &= 0. \end{split} \end{equation*} This 'proof' doesn't resort to $\mu(E) < \infty$, so it seems to me.

681454,Topology on the space of compatible almost complex structures in symplectic geometry,"I have a few fairly generic questions, with a specific application to symplectic geometry in mind. Let me pose the specific problem first: Let a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ be given. One is naturally led to consider the ""space"" $\mathcal{J}$ of almost complex structures compatible with $\omega.$ One then shows that this space is non-empty and contractible. Of course, this is really just a set until one equips it with a topology. My basic question is: what is this topology? I can think of one possibility, which rests on the apparent fact (stated without proof in Audin-Lafontaine) that one has a bundle $\mathcal{J}(\omega) \to M$ of compatible almost complex structures, with fiber $\mathcal{J}_p = \{ \text{complex structures of } T_pM \text{ compatible with } \omega_p \}.$ Our space $\mathcal{J}$ is then the space of sections of said bundle. Working fiberwise, we can see that we have a bijection $\mathcal{J}_p \cong Sp_{2n}/U(n),$ so we could let $\mathcal{J}_p$ inherit the topology of that homogeneous space. Is there a natural way, then, to construct a topology on $\mathcal{J}$ using the topologies on the fibers $\mathcal{J}_p?$ More generally, is there a natural way to topologize the space of sections of a vector bundle that applies to this scenario? Finally, how would one construct the bundle $\mathcal{J}(\omega)$ from the fibers and the base space? I suppose one could use the fiber bundle construction theorem, but then one would need specific transition maps.","['almost-complex', 'riemannian-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Ie.,  $\mu_n \to \mu$ if for every continuous $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ with compact support,
$$
\int f(x) d\mu_n(x) \to \int f(x) d\mu(x).

$$
\mathbb{E} F(\mu_n) \to \mathbb{E}F(\mu).
$$ Finally, to my question. If $\mu_n$ converges in law to $\mu$, is it true that there exists a realization of these point processes on a probability space such that on compact sets the point processes converge almost surely?

681577,Intuition behind (statistical) completeness,"I was wondering if any of the members of the MSE community would like to share his/her intuition about completeness in statistics. For the sake of ""completeness"", here's the definition, taken from Wikipedia : Consider a random variable $X$ whose probability distribution belongs to a parametric family of probability distributions $P_\theta$ parametrized by $\theta$ . The statistic $T$ is said to be complete for the distribution of $X$ if for every measurable function $g$ (which must be independent of $\theta$ ) the following implication holds: $$E(g(T(X))) = 0 \mbox{ for all }\theta \mbox{ implies that }P_\theta(g(T(X)) = 0) = 1\mbox{ for all }\theta.$$ Now, to give you an idea of what kind of answer I am looking for, here's how I think about (minimal) sufficiency: I think of a statistic as a partition of the sample space. In that context, a statistic is sufficient for $\theta$ if this partition does not result in a loss of ""information"" about $\theta$ ; it is minimal sufficient if it is the coarsest partition which does not result in a loss of information (superlatives carry a uniqueness connotation, which I am ignoring here).","['statistics', 'intuition', 'random-variables']"
681580,What exactly is a modulus of continuity?,"This is my first post on here, so forgive me if I am ignorant of certain customs. I am currently reading Courant & John's Introduction to Calculus and Analysis Volume I . Unfortunately, I have stumbled upon an ambiguous notation on page 41. It begins: Our definition of continuity of the function $f(x)$ at $x_0$ requires that for every degree of precision $\epsilon > 0$ there exists quantities $\delta \gt 0$ (so-called moduli of continuity) such that $|f(x)-f(x_0)| < \epsilon$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ for which $|x-x_0| < \delta$ . He then goes on to say that (for ""regular continuity""): In general, as our example show, this $\delta = \delta(\epsilon)$ depends not only on $\epsilon$ but also on the value of $x_0$ . What exactly is meant by a modulus of continuity and how is it related to $\delta(\epsilon)$ ? Edit - Upon further inspection I have noted that the ""modulus of continuity"" depends on both $x_0$ and $\epsilon$ for ""regular continuity"", however only depends on $\epsilon$ for uniform continuity. I believe that some of the confusion has been cleared by the notation of $\delta(\epsilon)$ . However, he states that moduli of continuity are simply quantities $\delta > 0$ .

681586,The Derivative of a General Linear Map,"This question is somewhat abstract compared to the things we've discussed in class, so I'm just making sure I've got the right idea. I'd appreciate any help/suggestions; I'm pretty sure I've got the right answer, but I may be totally incorrect in what I think the question is asking. The question is:
Suppose $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear map. What is the derivative of $f$ ? My answer is: Let $f: A \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear map where $A$ is an open set. Let $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ . From the def. of a linear map, we know that $f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x)$ and $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ . Thus, to be a linear map, no element in the image of $f$ can contain the product of elements in the domain of $f$ (otherwise, $f(x_1,x_2) = x_1x_2 \implies f(\alpha_1x_1,\alpha_2x_2) = \alpha^2x_1x_2 \ne \alpha f(x_1,x_2)$ ). Given the above statement, all linear maps from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ must have the form... $f(x_1,...,x_n) =$ $\begin{pmatrix} 
a_{1,1} x_1 ~ + ...+ ~ a_{1,n} x_n \\
\vdots \\
a_{m,1}x_1 ~ + ... + ~ a_{m,n} x_n
\end{pmatrix}$ Where $a_{i,j}$ is the coefficient of the $x_{j}$ term in the $i^{th}$ row. The derivative of this function is the matrix of partial derivatives of $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ . Note, though, that the partial derivative of any row with respect to $x_i$ is just the coefficient of the $x_i$ term (since no other term in the row depends on $x_i$ , thus their partial derivatives are zero). So our matrix of partial derivatives becomes: $\frac{df}{dx} = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_{1,1} & ... & a_{1,n} \\
\vdots & \ddots\\
a_{m,1} & ... & a_{m,n}

Conclude that $Y$ contains all nonabelian members of $X$. Let $X=\{N_1,...,N_k\}$.  I have the result that each $N_i$ is the direct product of isomorphic (specifically, conjugate in $G$) simple subgroups.  Since the center of a direct product is the direct product of the centers, this tells us that for all $N_i$, either $Z(N_i)=1$ or $Z(N_i)=N_i$.  This plus part (b) seems to indicate that we can leave out the abelian subgroups, but I certainly do not see why. If the $N_i$ are finite, then we must have $Y=X$ because otherwise $\prod Y$ must have smaller order and cannot equal $K$, so I think I should be working in the fully general case of infinite minimal normal subgroups in infinite groups.

681795,Lower limit topology doesn't arise from metric; proof by contradiction.,"This problem is in Tao's Epsilon of the room, 1.6.11. Show that the half-open topology (Example 1.6.22) is Hausdorff, but does not arise from a metric. (Hint: assume for contradiction that the half-open topology did arise from a metric; then show that for every real number x there exists a rational number q and a positive integer n such that the ball of radius 1/n centred at q has infimum x.) And I proved it in below way; I think this proof has some missing points; Could you verify this proof? Clearly, Let $F$ be half-open interval topology and $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and without loss of generality, $x<y$. Then $[x,y)$ and $[y,y+1)$ is clearly open neighborhood of $x,y$ without nonempty intersection. Hence this topology is hausdorff. Now we want to show that it doesn't arise from metric space. For contradiction, suppose it is arise from metric space. By definition of metrizable topology, for any $[x,y) \in F$ can be represented as union of open balls $B(x_0, r) = \{ x \in X : d(x_0 , x) < r\}$. We know that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so for any open sets $[a,b) \in F$, $\mathbb{Q} \cap [a,b) \neq \emptyset$. Hence $F$ is separable. With the fact that $\mathbb{Q} \cap [a,b)$ is dense in $F$ and $F$ is metrizable, there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x= \inf\{B(q,\frac{1}{n})\}$. However this is contradiction when $x \notin \mathbb{Q}$ since $ \inf\{B(q,\frac{1}{n})\} = (q-\frac{1}{n},q+\frac{1}{n})$ has infimum as $q-\frac{1}{n}$, which is rational number. Therefore, $F$ is not metrizable.","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

681810,one-dimensional inverse square laws,"I suddenly became curious about the following differential equation:
\begin{align*} 
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{k}{x(t)^2} && x(0) = x_0 > 0 && \frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0
\end{align*}
the ""1D inverse square law problem"". It's a pretty natural thing to think about. You're a positive distance $x_0$ away from a point particle which is exerting an inverse square force on you. You're moving only radially with respect to that particle with initial velocity $v_0$. What happens? Do all solutions have a ""closed form""? Do some of them? Obviously the behaviour can be quite different depending on the intial conditions. For example, if $k <0$, you're either going to fall into the ""black hole"", or you're going to escape to infinity (or is it even possible to asympotically approach some finite maximum distance from below as $t \to +\infty$?). Edit: I thought of one solution: letting $x(t) = a t^{2/3}$, one gets $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{-2a}{9} t^{-4/3}$ so that $x^2 \cdot  \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = \frac{-2a^3}{9}$ whence, taking $a = - \left( \frac{9k}{2} \right)^{1/3}$, we get a solution. We could also shift the time variable to get some more solutions. Edit2: The preceding solution is simple enough that I figured this was the ""minimal escape curve"" i.e. the one where you have precisely enough energy to escape to infinity. Indeed, it's not hard to check this by calculuating the kinetic and potential energy when $t= 1$ i.e. $x=a$. But my friend pointed out a much nicer way to see this! Notice $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2a}{3} t^{-1/3} \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$. Since the veclocity goes to zero, the kinetic energy goes to zero. So, by conservation of energy, this is the minimal escape curve (if you had any spare energy left at $x = \infty$, you wouldn't have slowed to velocity zero). Edit3: In the end I found out how to get the solutions implicitly. See my answer here .","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'physics']"

The Wikipedia article about Projection (mathematics) gives a good example with the dot and the shadow, but I'm having problem with this statement: The restriction to a subspace of a projection is also called a
  projection, even if the idempotence property is lost. What does ""The restriction"" refer to? Any restriction? Any subset of a projection is an projection in itself?

681838,What went wrong? [One-dimensional-inverse-square-law],"Intrigued by this question, one-dimensional inverse square laws ,
I started to try to find an answer and came up with what follows. However, I calculated the derivatives to double check myself, and this does not work. However, it seems straightforward enough that I do not see my mistake. Question: Is there a closed form solution to all $$ \ddot x = \frac{k}{x^2}  \quad (x(0)=x_0), \  \dot{x}(0) = v_0, \ k \in \mathbb{R}.$$ Here is my very naive two cents. Multiplying both sides by $\dot{x}$ and obtain, $$ \dot{x} \ddot{x} =  \frac{k \dot{x}}{x^2}.$$ Integrating both sides,  we obtain
\begin{equation} \tag{1} \frac{ (\dot{x})^2}{2} = -\frac{k}{x} + C. \end{equation} Here it seems natural to re-write this as,
\begin{equation} \tag{2} \dot{x} = \sqrt{2} \sqrt{C - \frac{k}{x}}. \end{equation}
I do not know if that is fully acceptable. However, if it is we then have via integration one more time, or rather letting WolframAlpha integrate one side, $$x(t) = \sqrt{2} x \sqrt{C - \frac{k}{x}} - \frac{ k \log \left( 2 \sqrt{C} x \sqrt{C - \frac{k}{x}} + 2Cx - k \right)}{\sqrt{2C}} + \tilde{C}. $$ Note, that both $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ are determined by initial conditions. Using the given initial conditions and (1), we can solve for $C$, to find that $C = \frac{v_0^2}{2} + \frac{k}{x_0}.$ Similarly we could solve for $\tilde{C}$, but before I did that I discovered my solution was wrong. If you substitute my ""solution"" back into the differential equation, you find (much to my dismay) $$ \ddot{x} = \frac{k}{x^2 \sqrt{2c - \frac{k}{x}}}. $$ Insight on my  mistake and/or a proper way to solve this is greatly appreciated.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

After thinking about it for a while, I couldn't come up with either an example of this or a proof that this is impossible. Is this known (I didn't manage to find it online)? Comments :
One thing I noticed is that, if $p > 1$ is fixed, we may assume without loss of generality that $$\frac{1}{n^p} <a_n < \frac{1}{n} \forall n.$$ The reason the following: Assume there exists $a_n$ that satisfies the above two conditions, and let $S = \left\{n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 1 | a_n < \frac{1}{n}\right\}$. Then for every $n \geq 1, n \notin S$, we have $a_n \leq na_n^2$, thus $$\sum_{n \notin S} a_n \leq \sum_{n \geq 1} n a_n^2 < \infty $$ Therefore, since $\sum_{n \geq 1} a_n = \infty$, it follows that $\sum_{n \in S} a_n = \infty$. If we take $b_n = \begin{cases} a_n, &n \in S \\ 0, &n \notin S  \end{cases}$, $b_n$ is a non-negative sequence also satisfying the above two properties. Therefore, we may assume wlog that $a_n < \frac{1}{n} \forall n$. Now, if $p>1$ is fixed we may also assume wlog that $a_n > \frac{1}{n^p}$, because if $a_n$ satisfies the two properties, then $$b_n = \begin{cases} a_n, &a_n > \frac{1}{n^p} \\ \frac{1}{n^{(p+1)/2}}, &a_n \leq \frac{1}{n^p}  \end{cases}$$

682290,Is $GL(n;\mathbb{C})$ algebraic or not?,"The set of $n\times n$ matrices can be identified with $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$. 1) Consider the subset $V$ of the affine space $\mathbb{A}^{n^2+1}$ (note plus one) given by
$$V:=\{(x_{ij},t): \det(x_{ij})\cdot t-1=0\}$$
This is an algebraic subset, indeed $V=V(f)$ where $f=\det(x_{ij})\cdot t-1\in\mathbb{C}[x_{ij},t]$. Then consider the map $\phi:GL(n;\mathbb{C})\longrightarrow V$ sending the matrix $(a_{ij})$ to the $(n^2+1)$-tuple $(a_{ij},\frac{1}{\det(a_{ij})})$. This is a bijection, making $GL(n;\mathbb{C})$ also algebraic . 2) $GL(n;\mathbb{C})$ is the complement of the algebraic variety in $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ defined by the vanishing of the determinant polynomial, and so is open in the Euclidean topology. Since every affine algebraic variety in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is closed in the Euclidean topology, we can conclude that the general linear group is not an algebraic variety. So what should I argue from the above reasoning? 1) $GL(n;\mathbb{C})$ is algebraic 2) $GL(n;\mathbb{C})$ is not algebraic 3) It is a common fact that some subsets can be algebraic in one affine space and not algebraic in an affine space of different dimension, so both 1) and 2) can be correct.","['matrices', 'algebraic-geometry']"

682328,Equivalence of categories of vector bundles and locally free sheaves,"Let $X$ be a scheme. It is known that the category $\mbox{Vec}_r(X)$ of vector bundles of rank $r$ on $X$ and the category $\mbox{Loc}_r(X)$ of locally free sheaves of rank $r$ on $X$ are equivalent (The equivalence is given by the functor $F\colon \mbox{Loc}_r(X)\rightarrow \mbox{Vec}_r(X)$ such that $F(\mathcal{E})=\textbf{Spec}(\mbox{Sym}(\check{\mathcal{E}}))$, where $\mbox{Sym}(\mathcal{F})$ is the symmetric algebra of $\mathcal{F}$ and $\textbf{Spec}(.)$ is as defined in Hartshorne p.128. My confusion is the following. In many books it is written that a locally free subsheaf $\mathcal{E}'$ of a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ does not always correspond to a sub-vector bundle of the vector bundle $F(\mathcal{E})$. However, since the categories are equivalent, the monomorphism $\iota\colon\mathcal{E}'\rightarrow\mathcal{E}$ maps to a monomorphism $F(\iota)\colon F(\mathcal{E}')\rightarrow F(\mathcal{E})$ in $\mbox{Vec}_r(X)$. So, I would expect to get a sub-vector bundle of the vector bundle $F(\mathcal{E})$. A monomorphism in a category is not always an injective map in the usual sense. Is it maybe the point that $F(\iota)$ might not be an injective map, although it is a monomorphism? PS: While I was trying to sort out this confusion, I looked in Hartshorne and was even more confused, because he does not define what a morphism of vector bundles is, although he defines what an isomorphism is (again on page 128).

682416,Matrix diagonalization theorems and counterexamples: reference-request.,"I'm looking for exhaustive list of diagonalization theorems and counterexamples in linear algebra. In this question I understand the question of matrix diagonalization very broadly:
suppose we have some group $G$ of matrices, where $G$ is one of $\operatorname{Gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ - real invertible matrices, $\operatorname{Gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ - complex invertible matrices, $\operatorname{O}(n)$ - orthogonal matrices, $\operatorname{SO}(n)$ - special orthogonal matrices, $\operatorname{U}(n)$, $\operatorname{SU}(n)$ - unitary and special unitary matrices, generalization of 3-5: matrices with real or complex coefficients, satisfying either of $M C M^{-1} = C$ or $M C M^* = C$ for some fixed matrix $C$. This includes e.g. Lorentz group, group of symplectic matrices. Also we have some set $S$ of matrices we want to diagonalize, where $S$ is one of $M^n(\mathbb{R})$ - all real valued matrices, $M^n(\mathbb{C})$ - all complex-valued matrices, self-adjoint matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, anti-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{R}$, normal matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. I'm interested in the orbits of action of $G$ on $S$, where action is one of $s \mapsto gsg^{-1}$ ($s$ is interpreted as an endomorphism) and $s\mapsto gsg^*$ ($s$ is interpreted as a bilinear form): what is the ""nicest"" form of matrix, which we can find on any orbit? May be its not exactly diagonal, but Jordan, or made from $2\times 2$ blocks on the diagonal - all of these are examples of ""nice"" forms. The typical questions I would ask are Is it true, that for a real matrix $m$, its diagonizability by $\operatorname{Gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ (with the obtained diagonal matrix being real) implies the diagonizability by $\operatorname{Gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ (as an endomorphism)? (Yes) Is every (real) symmetric matrix diagonizable as a bilinear form by Lorentz transformations (in $\mathbb{R}^4$)? Can every real antisymmetric form be transformed by the same Lorentz group to a matrix with blocks of the form $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & -\lambda \\ \lambda & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ on the diagonal? Can any real matrix $m$ be transformed to a matrix with $1\times1$ and $2\times 2$ blocks on the diagonal by $SO(n)$? ( No ) What if you are allowed to have Jordan-like form, i.e. whenever two blocks on the diagonal are the same, one can have identity matrix on the diagonal next to it? (Still no by the dimension counting argument) Ok, what is the simplest shape one can hope for? Note that two transformation types coincide for $SO(n)$, $O(n)$, $U(n)$, $SU(n)$, so I don't need to specify one in the question #3.

682476,"Have averages, need variance","I have a large spreadsheet, generated by a colleague, that contains the results of $E$ experiments. For each experiment, he calculated the average of $M$ measurements. I need the calculate the average and variance of all measurements, but due to the complex structure of the spreadsheet, I cannot make the calculation directly in the spreadsheet, nor copy the data to another spreadsheet. How can use the current data, i.e., the averages per experiment and the number of measurements per experiment, to calculate the average and variance of all measurements? Here is what I did so far. Let $x_{ij}$ be measurement $j$ in experiment $i$. Let $a_i$ be the average of experiment $i$: $$a_i = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M}{ x_{ij} } $$ Let $A$ be the total average: $$A = \frac{1}{EM} \sum_{i=1}^{E}{ \sum_{j=1}^{M}{ x_{ij} } } = \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i=1}^E {a_i}$$ So, I CAN calculate the total average by averaging the averages per experiment $a_i$. However, this trick doesn't seem to work for the variance. I need to calculate $V$: $$V = \frac{1}{EM} \sum_{i=1}^{E}{ \sum_{j=1}^{M}{ (x_{ij} - A)^2 } }$$ But if I calculate the variance of the $a_i$'s, I get: $$V' = \frac{1}{E} \sum_{i=1}^{E}{ (a_{i} - A)^2 }$$ These don't seem similar: $$V - V' 
  = \frac{1}{EM} \sum_{i=1}^{E}{ 
   \sum_{j=1}^{M}{ [(x_{ij} - A)^2

   \sum_{j=1}^{M}{ [(x_{ij} + a_{i} - 2A)\cdot(x_{ij}-a_{i})]

I had already computed the Čech cohomology, and was looking for a shortcut. However, it was suggested that Čech cohomology is the best way of doing this, and to be honest it still gives rise to an interesting question (at least in my opinion). To be concrete, I will fix the cover I am using: I have a natural projection $\pi\colon X \rightarrow \mathbb P_k^1$, and I let $U_\infty = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(\infty)$, and similarly for $U_0$. Then
$$ H^1(X,\Omega_X) = \frac{\Omega_X(U_0 \cap U_\infty)}{\{\omega_0 - \omega_\infty|\omega_i \in \Omega_X(U_i)\}}$$

682762,Thinking of mathematics in terms of analogs,"I think the way that I've come to think about mathematics is becoming problematic and I'm wondering if I should abandon it. When I study mathematics, I find myself trying to compare the mathematical constructs, operations, entities, and even the basic terminology (which I have come to understand is incredibly elegant, precise, and deliberate) to real world, physical, even visible phenomena. I think under the pretense that the things I do in the mathematical world represent real, fundamental structures in this Universe. For example, the fact that terms can 'cancel' out in an equation has profound implications on the workings of the Universe and should be heeded and studied as such. In other words, I try to make sense of the things I learn in math classes by finding their analogs in the real word, because I assume they must have at least one. Thinking with this frame of mind has led me to appreciate mathematics in a deeply profound and beautiful way, and it's the mindset that I try to share with other people when explaining why mathematics should be studied and why people describe it as beautiful. When I learn something new in a math class, I try to understand and remember that these are not simply tedious equations and formulas that mean nothing and come from nowhere, but that they have real physical and, mostly, intuitive meaning. All that being said, I'm taking my first liner algebra course this term, and it's becoming harder to utilize this mentality, not simply because linear algebra deals with such things as infinite dimensionality which we obviously have no intuitive way of grasping or visualizing, but really just because the class seems more about computation and calculation than concept and philosophy. I worry that my thinking has led me astray, primarily because it becomes hard to focus on just doing sheer, brute force calculation without wondering and worrying about what these constructs really mean. This leads me to fall behind in lecture, take hours longer than is probably necessary on the homework, and add to an overall level of frustration that has been building for some time now because of it, which only clouds my understanding even more. My question is really more of a plea for advice. Should I abandon my way of thinking about mathematics as though it will become increasingly unhelpful in future courses and topics, or is linear algebra truly more about numerical gymnastics than tangible interpretation? Should I focus, currently, on simply learning the algorithms for computation now assuming that the philosophical groundwork will be exposed later on, after which the conceptual work that I'm looking for will yield itself?

Then $p^{-1}(C_{i})$ is the zero locus (in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$) of the ideal generated by all homogenous elements in $I_{i}$ without the origin. And this is closed in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}-\{0\}$.

Since $p$ is surjective $Z=p(D_{1})\cup p(D_{2})$. But I don't think $p(D_{i})$ are necessarily closed. I'm not sure how else to show irreducibility other than start with a decomposition, though. Any help or hint is appreciated. Thanks in advance!",['algebraic-geometry']
682777,Is an abelian group characterized by its localizations?,Let $G$ and $H$ be countable abelian groups. Assume that for every prime number $p$ there is an isomorphism $G\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]\cong H\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]$. Does it follow that $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic as abelian groups? (Note that this is certainly true for finitely generated groups. Moreover it also holds if all isomorphisms $G\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]\cong H\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{p}]$ are induced by one fixed group homomorphism $G\to H$. In both cases it is enough to consider two different prime numbers.),"['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
682779,Prime factors of $2^{2^2}+3^{3^3}+5^{5^5}+7^{7^7}$,"Are there any useful restrictions to the prime factors of the number $$2^{2^2}+3^{3^3}+5^{5^5}+7^{7^7}?$$ The two smallest are $6771419$ and $72153167$ , which I found by trial division. The number is small enough for ECM, but this is quite slow for numbers
of this magnitude. Is there anything better than trial division or ECM ?","['prime-factorization', 'tetration', 'number-theory']"
682825,Distribution of time spent above $0$ by a Brownian Bridge.,"Let's say I have a Brownian motion, such that I know its value at time 0 (0) and time T (also 0). I am trying to evaluate the time spent above 0 between time 0 and T. Obviously I know that the average of this value is 1/2, but is there a way to know the full law of that duration? Or are there other known theoretical results for this? I am guessing this is a fairly common problem but I am unable to find references for this.

682842,Scaling the normal distribution?,"I might just be slow (or too drunk), but I'm seeing a conflict in the equations for adding  two normals and scaling a normal. According to page 2 of this , if $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)$ and $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2,\sigma_2^2)$, then $X_1 + X_2 \sim N(\mu_1 + \mu_2, \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2)$, and for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $cX_1 = N(c\mu_1, c^2\sigma_1^2)$. Then for $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, we have $X + X = N(\mu + \mu,\sigma^2 + \sigma^2) = N(2\mu,2\sigma^2)$, but also $X + X = 2X = N(2\mu,2^2\sigma^2) = N(2\mu,4\sigma^2)$ ? Ie, the variances disagree. edit: Oh, am I mistaken in saying that $2X = X + X$? Is the former ""rolling"" $X$ just once and doubling it while the latter ""rolls"" twice and adds them?","['statistics', 'normal-distribution', 'probability']"
