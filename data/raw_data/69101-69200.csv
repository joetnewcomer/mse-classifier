835774,Under what conditions can a function $ y: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ be expressed as $ z z' $?,"This is a follow-up to Under what conditions can a function $ y: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ be expressed as $ \dfrac{z'}{z} $? . It turns out that in that case,
\begin{align}
       \text{$ y = \dfrac{z'}{z} $ for some differentiable $ z $}
& \iff \text{$ y $ has an anti-derivative} \\
& \iff \text{$ y $ is discontinuous on a meager $ F_{\sigma} $-subset of $ \mathbb{R} $}.

I was thus wondering whether the answer is still the same in this case.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
835789,Identifying the dual group of a locally compact abelian group with the spectrum of $ {L^{1}}(G) $.,"Folland stated the following theorem in his book A Course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis on Page 88. The dual group of a locally compact abelian group can be identified with the spectrum of $ {L^{1}}(G) $. It came without a proof, so could anyone kindly provide me with some comments on my attempt below? Proof : Let $ G $ be a locally compact abelian group and $ \widehat{G} $ the dual group of $ G $, i.e., $ \widehat{G} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \text{Hom}(G,\mathbb{T}) $, where $ \mathbb{T} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \{ z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| = 1 \} $. The spectrum of $ {L^{1}}(G) $, denoted by $ \text{Spec}({L^{1}}(G)) $, is defined as
$$
\text{Spec}({L^{1}}(G))
\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}
\{
F \in {L^{1}}(G)^{\star} \mid
F \not\equiv 0 ~ \text{and} ~ F(f * g) = F(f) \cdot F(g)
\},
$$
where $ * $ denotes convolution. In other words, $ \text{Spec}({L^{1}}(G)) $ is the set of all non-zero multiplicative linear functionals on $ {L^{1}}(G) $. To show that $ \widehat{G} $ can be identified with $ \text{Spec}({L^{1}}(G)) $, we need to construct a $ 1 $-$ 1 $ correspondence $ \widehat{G} \to \text{Spec}({L^{1}}(G)) $. Define such a correspondence as follows. Every $ \beta \in \widehat{G} $ defines a multiplicative linear functional $ \hat{\beta} $ on $ {L^{1}}(G) $ by
$$
\forall f \in {L^{1}}(G): \quad
\hat{\beta}(f)
\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}
\int_{G} f(g) \beta(g) ~ \mathrm{d}{g}. \quad \blacksquare
$$ Question: Did I define the $ 1 $-$ 1 $ correspondence correctly?","['topological-groups', 'banach-algebras', 'harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

The denominator can't be an odd degree polynomial, or else it has a zero somewhere. If the numerator is a polynomial of degree greater than the denominator $N>D$, then we get surjectivity (if $N-D$ is odd), or we lose injectivity (if $N-D$ is even). If $N\leq D$, then we lose injectivity, since the function will approach the same limit as $x \to \pm \infty$ (I claim that together with continuity, this implies that we lose injectivity).

836349,(Co)homology of free symmetric algebra,"Let $V$ be a (co)chain complex, and let $Sym(V)$ be the free differential graded-commutative algebra generated by $V$. Definition and examples below in case you don't know what I mean. Question: What's the cleanest proof that $H^*(Sym(V)) \cong Sym(H^*(V))$? All my proofs are a little messy, using the gradings on Sym(V) coming from cohomological grading and degree by the number of products. Though I expect all proofs to use this bigrading, a clean, succinct proof would be very appreciated! Definition: $Sym(V)$ is the free dg tensor algebra on $V$, modded out by the relation $v_1 v_2 = (-1)^{|v_1| |v_2|} v_2 v_1$. The differential is given by the Leibniz rule: $d(uv) = (du)v + (-1)^{|u|}u dv$. Example: If $V$ is concentrated in degree 0, $Sym(V)$ is the usual free commutative algebra generated by $V$. If $V$ is concentrated in even degrees, the underlying vector space of $Sym(V)$ is the usual free commutative algebra, but $Sym(V)$ has a grading where $|v_1 \ldots v_n| = |v_1| + \ldots + |v_n|$. The differential is zero by the Leibniz rule. Example: If $V$ is concentrated in odd degrees, $Sym(V)$ has underlying vector space given by the exterior algebra generated by $V$.

836362,Why are higher-degree polynomial equations more difficult to solve?,"I am confused about the significance of the powers on equations. For example, in $ax = b$, intuitively $b$ is a value $x$ multiplied $a$ times. In $ax + b = c$, $c$ is a value $x$ multiplied $a$ times added to by $b$. In $ax^2 + bx + c = d$, $d$ is a value $x$ multiplied by itself and by another value $a$ added to by the $x$ multiplied by a value $b$ and that added to by another value $c$. This and so on. Even in the simple equation $x^2 = y$, $x$ is intuitively $\sqrt{y}$ and so on for arbitrary powers and roots. For the equation $x + x = y$, $x$ is placed doubly and $y$ is equal to that doubled x, so $x$ would be $y$ halved. But when a particular case like $x^2 + x = y$ arises and so on with all orders and polynomials of those orders (""higher order equations""), it cannot be solved so easily and the whole process begins to seem much more foreign and contrived.

Each spy must throw at least one stone on their turn, until all $N$ stones are gone. They observe all throws and separate when there are no more stones. No information is exchanged except the number of stones thrown on each turn. Given that $N$ is known in advance, what is the largest possible value of $M$?

For example, if $X=\{a,b\}$ and the typology $T=\{\emptyset, \{a\},X\}$ then ""getting close to $b$"" implies getting close to $a$, but not the reverse. You can get so close to $a$ that you are no longer close to $b$. I know that these imprecise English words like ""close"" and ""neighborhood"" shouldn't be regarded as too strongly related to topological definitions, but I'm still wondering if it's possible to give an intuitive conception of what open sets ""mean"" or what they are, in a non-Hausdorff space.

$$f(x;\theta)=a(\theta)b(x)$$
is a probability density function for each $\theta > 0$. Find the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$. My try: Our likelihood function is given by
$$L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n a(\theta)b(x_i) = a(\theta)^nb(x)^n$$
The log likelihood function is given by
$$\ln L(\theta) = n\ln a(\theta) + n \ln b(x)$$
Equating it to zero we get
$$\ln a (\theta) = - \ln b(x)$$
which obviously leads to nowhere. Moreover, the question itself seems weird to me. I am used to the form of ""Given a random sample $X_1,...,X_n$ of size $n$ (...)"", since this is missing now, does this imply that I cannot use the usual method I demonstrated above? Lastly, if you want to, could you check the exercise below for errors? Let $X_1,...,X_n$ denote a random sample from
$$f(x;\theta) = f_\theta (x) = \theta f_1(x) + (1-\theta)f_0 (x)$$
where $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$ and $f_0(\cdot)$ and $f_1(\cdot)$ are known densities, estimate $\theta$ by the method of moments. Answer: First, we need to write $E[X]$ in a better form:
\begin{align*}
E[x] &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\cdot f(x;\theta)dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\theta f_1(x) + (1-\theta)f_0 (x))dx \\
&= \theta \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\cdot f_1 (x)dx + (1-\theta)\int_{-\infty}^\infty x\cdot f_0 (x)dx \\
&= \theta \int x(f_1-f_0)dx + \int x f_0 dx \\
&=\theta \left(E_1\left[x\right] - E_0\left[x\right]\right) + E_0\left[x\right]
\end{align*}
Equating this to the first sample moment ($m_1'$) we get:
\begin{align*}
m_1'= \theta \left(E_1\left[x\right] - E_0\left[x\right]\right) + E_0\left[x\right]
\end{align*}
which is equivalent to 
\begin{align*}
\theta = \dfrac{m_1' - E_0[x]}{E_1[x] - E_0[x]}
\end{align*}
Hence, our method of moments estimator for $\theta$ is given by:
$$\hat{\theta} = \dfrac{m_1' - E_0[x]}{E_1[x] - E_0[x]}$$ Both are questions from ""Introduction to the theory of statistics"" by Mood, Graybill and Boes. Thanks in advance!","['statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
