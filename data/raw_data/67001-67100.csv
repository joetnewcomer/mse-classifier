798640,What's the intuition for extending $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}$?,"It seems to me that there is a clear, intuitive reason for extending the real number system to the complex number system. Namely, some polynomial equations that have no solutions in $\mathbb{R}$ become soluble in $\mathbb{C}$. When we do this, we lose almost none of the nice algebraic properties of the reals, and pick up some nice new ones along the way (e.g. fundamental theorem of algebra). However, I cannot see such an intuitive reason for similarly extending $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}$, other than ""because we can."" In so doing, we actually lose the important property of commutative multiplication. So precisely what problems do we solve by moving from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}$?

798771,Comparison of versions of the spectral theorem,"Definition: (Resolution of Identity) A projection valued measure that is finitely additive and factors over intersections. Theorem 1: Let $A$ be a normal operator in $H$ a Hilbert Space where everything is over the complex field.  Then there exists an $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ measure space and a unitary equivalence between $H$ and $L^2(X)$ so that $A$ is represented as a multiplication operator of an $L^\infty$ function. I have already compared the versions of the spectral theorem for compact normal operators that involve no measure theory, as well as the interpretation of the bounded Borel functional calculus as a spectral theoretic result, and how this relates to the resolution of the identity.  The latter two are basically identical principles, whereas the first is sort of a special case.  The above theorem also seems to share the same basic idea as the bounded borel functional calculus and the existence and uniqueness resolution of identity corresponding to a normal operator. (This is usually called the spectral measure) Question 1: I do not see how to even derive the above theorem from either of these two other versions of the spectral theorem, and would be especially interested in a proof of this sort because it would also show relationships between these supposedly intuitively similar ideas.  I ask this because I suppose that the argument could probably be done quickly if the ideologies are basically the same, whereas were I to read separate arguments (which are hard to find on the web anyway) for this level of generality of theorem 1, I would then be left in the dark as to how it relates to anything resembling spectral theory.  The subject of resolution of identity was quite technical, and so one would hope that there is a way to not repeat this technical stuff for what seems to be another type of analogy between spectral decomposition and measure theory. Theorem 2: If $A$ is a bounded linear operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$ commuting with translations, then there exists an $L^\infty$ function $M$ such that $Af=\mathcal{F}^{-1} M \mathcal{F}f$ for all $f \in L^2$ In both the theorems here, the multiplier has infinity norm equal to the norm of $A$. Question 2: I observed that this actually implies, without assuming it, that in the context of theorem 2 $A$ is normal.  Is there a direct and easy argument verifying this without the full blown effort to prove the theorem? Question 3: since $A$ is normal, I see theorem 2 as saying that with additional hypotheses, you can pick a special unitary equivalence to a special $L^2$ space as the data realizing the conclusion of theorem 1.  Is there a deeper relationship between theorem 1 and 2 here? Question 4: We obviously have that the only reasonable uniqueness claim for theorem 2 is true.  But for theorem 1, if we fix a particular measure space that is among those that work, and fix a unitary equivalence (both these seem necessary) can we at least claim uniqueness of the multiplier?  It seems false without sigma finiteness, and so perhaps the following is not an interesting question but one could still ask if it's possible to select a measure space and unitary equivalence so that it is unique, even if the selection may not be sigma finite?  Is it always possible to make a sigma finite selection?  It would seem that the fact that $||A||$ being the same as the infinity norm of the multiplier in the context of theorem 1 is something you must be able to choose to have, but is not true of all otherwise valid choices. (For otherwise uniqueness of the multiplier would be guaranteed) I am most interested in questions 1-3, but answers to any subset of the 4 would be greatly appreciated.","['spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

798992,Is this a Correct Proof of the Principle of Complete Induction for Natural Numbers in ZF?,"I have reviewed a number of previous posts on this subject without finding an answer to my own point of interest, which is a proof that is closely related to ZF axioms and doesn't pre-suppose results on arithmetic, ordering or cardinality (there are a number of proofs using induction on the size of sets [cardinality] or which look at numbers < n (order) or which simply list numbers 1,2, ..n and then say something about n+1 [order and arithmetic]). Here is my attempt at a proof which excludes arithmetic, ordering or cardinality : I would appreciate feedback on its correctness. Summary of natural numbers and the principle of mathematical induction (PMI) in ZF: define the successor of a set X as $X^+ = X \cup$ {$X$}. Define Z as a successor set if $\emptyset \in Z$,  and $z \in Z \Rightarrow z^+ \in Z$. The axiom of infinity guarantees the existence of a successor set. Define $\omega$ as the minimal successor set and prove $\omega \subset$ every successor set. Define the natural numbers as the elements of $\omega$ and label them $0 = \emptyset; 1 = 0^+ = \, ${$0$}$; 2 = 1^+ = \,${$0, 1$}$, ...$. PMI then says that if $S \subset \omega$ and if $\emptyset \in S$,  and $s \in S \Rightarrow s^+ \in S$, then $S = \omega$. The proof is trivial: S is by definition a successor set and so $\omega \subset S$ and $S \subset \omega$ therefore $S = \omega$. Statement of the principle of complete induction for natural numbers (PCI) in ZF. Without involving order, PCI can be stated that if $\emptyset \ne S \subset \omega$  and if for $s \in \omega$, s $ \subset S \Rightarrow s \in S$, then $S = \omega$ . To see how this relates to a more common expression of PCI, note that the order relation on the naturals is defined by $x < s$ if $x \in s$. The elements of the set s are thus all the numbers less than s: so with the additional interpretation of order, PCI says that for a non-empty set S , if $x \in S \;\forall   \; x < s \Rightarrow s \in S$ then $S = \omega$. Proof: PMI $\Rightarrow$ PCI. Let S be a non-empty subset of $\omega$ where for $s \in \omega$, s $ \subset S \Rightarrow s \in S$. Note that $0 \in S$ because $0 (\in \omega) = \emptyset$ and $\emptyset \subset any set$ so $\emptyset (=0) \subset S \Rightarrow 0 \in S$ Let $T \subset S = ${$t \in S:t \subset S$} $0 \in T$ because  $0 \in S$ and $ 0 \subset S$, If $n (\in \omega)\in T$ then by the property of T $(n \in S$ and $n$ $ \subset S )$ which $\Rightarrow n \cup $ { n } $\subset S$. (see ** below) But $ n \cup $ { n } $ = n^+$, so $n^+$ $ \subset S$ and by  the property of S , $n^+$ $ \subset S \Rightarrow$   $n^+ \in S$ So by the specification of T , with $n^+ \in S$ and $n^+$ $ \subset S$ then $n^+ \in T$. So, $0 \in T$ and if $n \in T$ then $n^+ \in T$, so by PMI $T = \omega$, and $\omega = T \subset S \ \subset \omega$ so $S = \omega$ ∎ ** What $ n \cup $ { n } is, and why $(n \in S$ and $n$ $ \subset S )$ $\Rightarrow  n \cup $ { n } is a subset of S . The nesting of sets can be confusing.  $ n \cup $ { n } is a set whose elements are the elements of n , and the set n itself. If $m \in  n \cup $ { n }, then either (a) m is an element of n i.e. $m \in n$,  or (b)  $m = n$ .  If (a) since  $n$ $ \subset S $ then $m \in n \subset S \Rightarrow m \in S$ or if (b), since $n \in S$ then $m = n \in S$.  So in either case $m \in  n \cup $ { n } $\Rightarrow m \in S$, which is exactly the definition that $ n \cup $ { n } is a subset of S .","['induction', 'elementary-set-theory']"

799031,Galois group of irreducible Quartic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$,"Actual Question is  : What are all possible galois groups of an irreducible Quartic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ As polynomial is irreducible, Galois group is transitive subgroup of $S_4$. I have no idea what (actually why) are all transitive subgroups of $S_4$. Firstly, I would distinguish what are all possible subgroups (and then see for transitive subgroups) of $S_4$. As $|S_4|=24$ only possible orders of subgroups of $S_4$ are $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\}$ Subgroup of order $24$ $S_4$ is subgroup of order $24$ in $S_4$ (Trivial) Subgroup of order $12$ I have proved sometime back that $A_4$ is the only subgroup of $S_4$ having order $12$ but i could not recall the proof now (I would be thankful if some one can give some hint). Subgroups of order $8$ As $|S_4|=2^3.3$, there does exist a sylow $2$ subgroup i.e., subgroup of order $8$ in $S_4$. Only groups (upto isomorphism) of order $8$ are : $\mathbb{Z}_8,\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2, D_8,Q_8$. $\mathbb{Z}_8$ can not be a subgroup of  $S_4$ as $S_4$ does not have an element of order $8$. With lot of labor work i could see that no element of order $4$ commutes with an element of order $2$ thus $\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ can not be subgroup of $S_4$.( Help needed ) As of now i can not conclude why  (I know it is but not why) $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ is a subgroup of $S_4$. ( Help needed ) I know $D_8$ can be seen as subgroup of $S_4$. I know $Q_8$ can not be a subgroup of $S_4$. Subgroups of order $6$ Only groups of order $6$ are $\mathbb{Z}_6$ and $S_3$. $\mathbb{Z}_6$ can not be subgroup of $S_4$ as $S_4$ do not have an element of order $6$. $S_3$ is subgroup of $S_4$. This is not transitive because  : Suppose $S_3$ fixes $4$ then there is no way i can get an element which maps say $3$ to $4$. Thus $S_3$ is not transitive subgroup of $S_4$.. So, this $S_3$ is out of this game. Subgroups of order $4$ Only subgroups of order $4$ are $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is a subgroup of $S_4$ as $\{Id, (1234),(13)(24),(1432)\}$ which can be easily seen to be transitive.. In $\mathbb{Z}_4$,  i can send  $1$ to $2$ with $(1234)$ ; $1$ to $3$ with $(13)(24)$ and $1$ to $4$ with $(1432)$ similarly i can other elements to every othe element..

The flat connection would then just be the assignment of the tangent space parallel to the first factor, so $(x,y)$ gets associated the tangent space that looks like $\mathbb{R} \times y$.

Using the second limit definition would make showing the existence of $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ considerably easier, since $y_0$ makes the first term in the limit $0$, and $f(x_0,y_0)$ is defined to be $0$. But using the first definition, we have to evaluate: $$\frac{(x+h)^2 y^4}{(x+h)^4 + 6y^8} - \frac{x^2 y^4}{x^4 + 6y^8}$$ I'm hoping the ""real"" or at least usable definition is the second one, but which one is the one we're supposed to use in practice to be technically/mathematically correct?","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'derivatives', 'limits']"

I have attempted this myself and believe there must be a mistake because the answer doesn't seem to make sense. Can anybody help me?

Thus $$ I = - j \pi \sum \text{res}, $$ where the residues at the infinite set of first order poles $\omega = \pm n\pi /a $, ($n = 0,1,2...$), and the two first order poles $\omega = \pm \omega_0$ are given by $$ \mathrm{res}_\omega = \frac{ \omega_0 \cos{a\omega} e^{j \omega t} }{ (\omega_0^2 - \omega^2) a \cos{a \omega} - 2 \omega \sin{a \omega} },$$ and so $$ \begin{align} I & = - j \pi \Big( - \frac{1}{2} \cot{a \omega_0} e^{j \omega_0 t} - \frac{1}{2} \cot{a \omega_0} e^{-j \omega_0 t}  \Big) -  j \pi \Big( \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\omega_0 \cos{a \omega_n} e^{j \omega_n t}}{ (\omega_0^2 - \omega_n^2) a \cos{a \omega_n} } \Big) \\

My work: Let $m \in M$, $g \in G$. We need to show that $gmg^{-1} \in M$. Now let $T$ be an automorphism of $G$ such that $g = T(g_0)$ for some $g_0 \in G$ and also  $m = T(m_0)$ for some $m_0 \in G$. We now show that $m_0$ is actually in $M$: Since $m = T(m_0)$, we can also write $m_0 = T^{-1}(m)$, where $T^{-1}$ denotes the inverse of the bijection $T$. And as $T^{-1}$ is also an automorphism, we can conclude that $m_0 \in M$. Thus, $$ gmg^{-1} = T(g_0) T(m_0) T(g_0)^{-1} = T(g_0) T(m_0) T(g_0^{-1}) = T(g_0 m_0 g_0^{-1}).$$ Now as $m_0 \in M$ and $M \subset N$, we must have $m_0 \in N$; and since $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, it follows that $g_0 m_0 g_0^{-1} \in N$. Also, we note that $$ gmg^{-1} = T(g_0) T(m_0) T(g_0)^{-1} = T_{T(g_0)}(T(m_0)) = (T_{T(g_0)} o T)(m_0),  $$ and $T_{T(g_0)} o T$ is also an automorphism of $G$; thus it follows that $gmg^{-1} \in M$, showing that $M$ is normal in $G$. Am I right? Or, is there any lacuna in my effort? By a characteristic subgroup, we mean a subgroup that is invariant under all automorphisms of the parent group. That is, $M$ is a characteristic subgroup of $N$ if and only if $T[M] \subset M$ for all automorphisms $T$ of $N$. Then $M$ can be shown to be a normal subgroup of $N$. Furthermore, for any $g \in G$, we define $T_g \colon G \to G$ as follows: $T_g(x) \colon = gxg^{-1} $ for all $x\in G$. This map can be shown to be an automorphism of $G$ and is called conjugation by $g$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups']"

Since (1) works by pigeonhole, (2) works because $\frac{13-1}{2} = 6$, and (4) works because there are 6 possible permutations of 3 cards, the trick succeeds. My question is whether the same trick can work with more than 52 cards. It is not obvious to me how to do so, nor compute the maximum number of (pairwise distinct) cards possible. Also, it seems to me that even if the trick can be made to work for $n$ cards, it may not work for $n-1$ cards! Any ideas?","['puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

800419,Submartingale example: proof,"I am trying to prove if the process $M_t = e^{W_t^2-t}$ is a submartingale ($W_t$ is the Wiener Process). The proof becomes a bit difficult, to the point where I am unsure how to move forward. Let me show you what I have done so far: \begin{align*}
\mathbb E\left[e^{W_t^2-t} \middle| \mathscr{F}_s\right] = &
\mathbb E\left[e^{(W_t-W_s+W_s)^2-t} \middle| \mathscr{F}_s\right] = &\\

800422,Question about the second fundamental form,"I am studying Riemannian geometry and have a question understanding something. I use Do Carmo's book. In the book, a vector field is defined for isometric immersions: for an immersion $$ f:M\rightarrow\bar{M} $$ a local vector field is defined as
$$ 
B(X,Y) = \bar{\nabla}_{\bar{X}}\bar{Y}-\nabla_xY
$$
It is said that $B(X,Y)$ does not depend on the extensions $\bar{X}$,$\bar{Y}$
. If $\bar{X}_1$ is another extension of $X$, We will have
$$
( \bar{\nabla}_{\bar{X}}\bar{Y}-\nabla_xY )
- \bar{\nabla}_{\bar{X}_1}\bar{Y}-\nabla_xY = \bar{\nabla}_{\bar{X}-\bar{X}_1}\bar{Y}
$$ In the book, it is indicated that because $\bar{X}-\bar{X}_1 = 0$ on $M$, so the above difference vanishes on $M$. But why? In my opinion, $B(X,Y)$ is defined on $\bar{M}$, so the difference vanishes on $M$ does not mean anything. Intuitively, we should have $\bar{X} = X + X^\perp$, where $X^\perp$ is normal to $X$. The choice of $X^\perp$ should be arbitrary. Thus $B(X,Y)$ will not be unique. Can someone help me to understand it?",['differential-geometry']
800427,Galois group of $X^5-n$,"In the following situation I want to find the Galois group of a specific polynomial: Let $n > 1$ be a square-free integer, $f =X^5 - n \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$, $x:=\sqrt[5]{n}$ and $\zeta=\text{e}^{2 \pi i /5}$. I could already show that $L=\mathbb{Q}[x,\zeta]$ is the splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $[L:\mathbb{Q}]=20$ because $[\mathbb{Q}[x]:\mathbb{Q}]=5$ and $[\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]:\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Now we define $x_j = x \zeta^j$ for $j=1,...5$ and want to determine the Galois group $G=\text{Aut}(L|\mathbb{Q})$ with the symmetric group $S_4$. Therefor we identify $\widetilde{G} \leq S_4$ with $G$. For $\sigma \in G$ we get an action on $S_4$ by defining $\sigma(x_j)=x_{\widetilde{\sigma}(j)}$ for $j=1,...,4$ where ${\widetilde{\sigma}} \in S_n$.

800453,The complex function $\log(1+e^{iz})$,"G.H. Hardy states the following: The function of the complex variable $z$ $$ e^{i p z} \log(1 \pm e^{iz})\frac{1}{z^{2} \pm \theta^{2}} = f(z), \
 (-1 < p <1, \theta >0),$$ 
       is infinitely-many valued, but can made single-valued by slitting the plane along the real axis and restricting the variable to the
  upper half. He then later says, Again, $\log(1+e^{iz})$ will be shown immediately to have an imaginary
  part which does not numerically exceed $i \pi$ as $z$ travels along the real axis. I don't quite understand the second statement. The function $\log(1+e^{iz})$ can be defined by the complex integral $$\int_{0}^{z}\frac{ie^{iw}}{1+e^{iw}} \, dw + \log 2.$$ The integrand has simple poles at $(2n+1) \pi$ with residue $1$. Each time we move around one of theses points from left to right, the imaginary part of $\log (1+e^{iz})$ decreases by $\pi$. Why then does the imaginary part of $\log(1+e^{iz})$ remain bounded as $z$ travels along the real axis?","['complex-integration', 'complex-analysis']"
