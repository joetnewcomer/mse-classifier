1955166,"Dynamical systems, causality and derivatives order","Talking about input/output representation of a dynamical system, the professor said that the equation(s) involved must satisfy this condition in order for the system to be qualified as ""causal"": the greatest derivatives order of the output should be lower than the greatest derivatives order of the input He explained the fact saying that if we dismiss the condition, we could imagine a system described by $$y(t) = \dot{u}(t)$$ that is  not feasible in our physical world where actions produce effects. He said ""if we knew the derivative of input, we'd know the future"". At first, I can't fully understand this assertion. If it is true, then why does the very knowledge of u(t) not imply the knowledge of the future?
I think this misunderstanding is due to the fact that I have just started studying system, so maybe i'm not in the correct perspective. However there's another problem yet: in the quoted condition there is not written "" derivatives of input are not allowed"". They can appear, given that their max order is lower than (..). Why this constraint implies causality? Finally, I'd be very grateful if you could point out main concepts that link together systems, derivatives, future. Thanks a lot","['derivatives', 'mathematical-modeling', 'systems-theory', 'dynamical-systems']"
1955217,Subordinate matrix norm of $1$-norm,"Show that for the vector norm $$\|x\|_1=\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|$$ the subordinate matrix norm is $$
\|A\|_1=\max_{1\leq j\leq n} \sum_{i=1}^n |a_{ij}|
$$ I've managed to narrow it down doing the following: $$
\|A\|_1=\sup_{\|u\|_1=1} \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n |(Au)_i|\right\} = \sup_{\|u\|_1=1} \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n \left|\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}u_j\right|\right\}
$$ Now intuitively I can see why the subordinate norm is what it is. I just can't come up with a mathematical way of proving it from here. I know $u_j=1$ when the sum in the sub. matrix norm is largest, however how do I prove that doing this makes the maximum equal to the supremum?","['matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'matrix-norms', 'linear-algebra']"

1955417,Without excluded middle: simple example of field with nilpotents?,"I would like to verify I'm not making a mistake. Does the statement ""fields do not have non-zero nilpotents"" depend on the law of excluded middle? All proofs of this fact I can conjure rely on the dichotomy $a=0\vee a\neq 0$ along with the implication (for fields) that $a\neq 0\implies a$ invertbile. Moreover, in algebraic geometry it's possible to show the generic ring of Zariski topoi is internally a field (has the implication $a\neq 0\implies a$ invertible, but not necessarily excluded middle). Is there some super simple example of a (commutative unitary) ring which is internally a field and has nilpotents? Added. What about the statement ""in a field, the only nilpotent is zero""? Remark. The implication ($\neg (a=0)\implies a$ is invertible) is not of my invention; it is taken as the definition of a ""ring of fractions"" in section 2 of this paper by Kock .

1955479,The complement of a simple non closed curve is path connected?,"Let $f: [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous and injective function and $C=f([0,1])$. Is it true that $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus C$ is path connected? It's pretty obvious that the answer should be positive, but it would be nice if there existed a not quite involved proof of it. My attempt so far: For every $x\in C$ there exists an $\varepsilon_x>0$ such that $B(x,\varepsilon_x)\cap C$ is connected. (Here by $B(x, \varepsilon)$ we denote the open ball centered at $x$ with radius $\varepsilon$). This is pretty straightforward because $[0,1]$ and $f([0,1])$ are homeomorphic. The collection $  \{ B(x, \varepsilon_x): x\in C\}$   is an open cover of the compact set $C$, so there exist $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ such that $C\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n B(x_i, \varepsilon_{x_i})=A$. Lets also assume that the $x_i$'s are ""consecutive"" with $x_1$ and $x_n$ be the starting and ending points of the curve respectively. 
We notice in particular that both of the sets $B(x_1, \varepsilon_{x_1})\setminus C$ and $B(x_n, \varepsilon_{x_n})\setminus C$ are path connected. This is a nice property that we will need. An easy (?) inductive argument shows that $A\setminus C$ is path connected. This is all due to $B(x_1, \varepsilon_1)\setminus C$ being path connected combined with the fact that the set $ B(x_2, \varepsilon_2) \cap C^c $ consists of two connected components, both of which intersect with $B(x_1, \varepsilon_1)$ and so on. From this it follows that $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus C$ is path connected as well. I think the proof is ok, but it uses a lot of stuff. Am I missing something obvious here? I also tried to go by contradiction. I supposed that $C$ cuts the plane into some path connected components and then I tried to close the curve avoiding self intersections. The plan was to create more than 2 path connected components and reach a contradiction by  the Jordan Curve Theorem. This seemed quicker, but it didn't  go through.","['real-analysis', 'plane-curves', 'connectedness', 'curves', 'general-topology']"

1956084,Möbius strip in non-orientable surface,"So I am trying to go over the proof of classification of surfaces and along the way, I would like to prove most result that are commonly used. So far, we can suppose the existence of a triangulation. Let establish the different definition that I would like to use here. Definition: A compact surface $X$ without boundary is said to be orientable if and only if $H_2(X, \mathbb{Z}) \neq 0$. If $X$ is not orientable, then it is said to be unorientable. Let $X$ be a surface and let $\mbox{Mob}$ be a Möbius strip, which is the quotient space $$\mbox{Mob} := (\mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1] )/\langle \tau \rangle.$$ where $\tau :\mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1] \to \mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-1, 1]$ is given by $t(s,t)=(s+1,-t)$. The core curve of $\mbox{Mob}$ is the simple close curve given by $\{(x,0)| x \in \mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}\} $. We can also assume the existence of a PL neighborhood for our curve. Definition: A curve $\gamma$ is one-sided if there exist an embedding $\varphi : \mbox{Mob} \to X$ such that the $\gamma$ is the core curve of $\varphi (\mbox{Mob})$. Using these definitions, I would like to prove the following proposition: Proposition: A surface $X$ is orientable if and only if it does not contain any one-sided curve. Here's a proof that if $X$ is orientable, then it does not contain any one-sided curve. However, I did not find a satisfactory proof of the converse. I would ideally like to have a net proof of this result using these definitions and most importantly without using the classification of surfaces (in particular the concept of genus). $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $e: \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to X$ is an embedding, and let 
$f: \mbox{Mob} \to X$ be such that $f \circ c= e$. 
Define $M= f(\mbox{Mob})$ and let $V= X-f (\mbox{Mob}_{\frac{1}{2}})$
where $$ \mbox{Mob}_{\frac{1}{2}} = (\mathbb{R}/2\mathbb{Z}  \times [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} ] )/\langle \tau \rangle.$$ It is straightforward to construct a deformation retraction
from $M$ to $e(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, $H_i(M) \cong H_i(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$. From the inclusions $M \cap V \to X$, $\iota_M: M \cap V \to M$,
and $\iota_V: M \cap V \to V$, we obtain the Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence $$ \cdots \to H_2(M) \oplus H_2(V) \to H_2(X)~ \stackrel{\delta}{\to} H_1(M \cap V) \stackrel{\iota_M \oplus \iota_V}{\longrightarrow} H_1(M) \oplus H_1(V) \to \cdots.$$ The space $V$ is an open 2-dimensional manifold and hence $H_2(V) = \{0\}$. 
In addition, $H_2(M) \cong H_2(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})=\{0\}$, and so the map $\delta$ is an injection.

The map $\iota_M$ is induced by the inclusion into $M$, and the class of $\partial M$

1956224,How does Dr. Anderson's famous haystack example justify Bayesian statistics?,"I'm looking at Dr. Anderson's explanation of Bayesian statistics for a simple haystack model, from http://www.ar-tiste.com/pwa-on-bayes.html and reproduced below: There are two sources of hay, one with no needles at all and one with up to 9 needles per stack. Let's assign precisely probability 1/2, for the sake of argument, to the case where I'm buying from the needle-free source. (This represents the ""null hypothesis"" in this example.) If I'm dealing with the potentially needly hay, let's assume that p= (1/2)(1/10) for 0,1, . . . ,9 needles in anyone stack. I search for needles in one stack, and find none. What do I now know? I know that this outcome had p = 1/2 for needle-free hay, p = 1/20 for needly hay; hence the probability of this outcome is 10 times as great if the hay is needle free. The new ""a posteriori"" probability of the null hypothesis is therefore 10/11 = (1/2)(1/2+1/20 ) rather than 1/2. Clearly I should buy this hay if that is a good enough bet. Now suppose I was an ordinary statistician: I would simply say my expected number of needles per stack is now down to 0 +/- 2.5, and to get to 90% certainty I must search at least ten more haystacks, which is ten times as boring. I have difficulty following this logic: (1/2)(1/2+1/20) = 11/40 by my calculation. I think this is the probability of buying two haystacks from our source with no needles. I think the null hypothesis is that our source is the needle-free seller. I'm not sure where 10/11 comes from. how is 0 +/- 2.5 derived? What does 0-2.5 expected # of needles actually mean?

Consider the joint distribution of $(X_1,X_2)$ which is a joint normal with mean = $(0,0)$ and covariance matrix 
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\ 1/2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ Now the thing is according to the rules of conditional probability the conditional variance for $X_1$ is $\left(1-\rho^2\right)\sigma_1^2 = \frac{3}{4}$ in this case. So far so good. Suppose we then consider the joint normal $\left(X_1,X_2,X_3\right)$, which has the covariance matrix 
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 1/2 & 1 & 1/2 \\ 0 & 1/2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ In this case, the conditional variance of $X_1$ is given by $$ 1 - \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\ 1/2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = 2/3$$ The questions I have now are: Since $X_1$ is not dependent on $X_3$ at all, why the conditional variance of $X_1$ drops from $3/4$ to $2/3$ when $X_3$ is taken into account?

If $n=2^e$ for $e \geq 2$, then $(\mathbb{Z}/2^e\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ is no longer a cyclic group, but a product of two cyclic groups. It is of the form $C_{2} \times C_{2^{e-2}}$.
For a more general integer $n$, we can simply use the Chinese remainder theorem to obtain the precise structure of $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ using the above results. My question is: Is there a similar result for the multiplicative group of a quotient ring of $\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$ where $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is the finite field of $p$ elements (where $p$ is a prime power)? That is, what is the structure of 
  $$(\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]/\left<f(X)\right>)^{\times}$$
  for a polynomial $f(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$? If $f(X)$ is irreducible, then this group is again cyclic (since we know that the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic). But what about the more general case? Again, we can use Chinese remainder theorem to reduce the general question to the case of $f(X)$ being a power of an irreducible. So what do we know about the structure of
$$(\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]/\left<f(X)^e\right>)^{\times}$$
for an irreducible $f(X) \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$ and $e \geq 2$?","['finite-fields', 'polynomials', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

Or is ""accuracy"" simply the TOLERANCE (permissible range of variation  from its nominal value) of the pipet? If so, how is tolerance for glassware determined? Is it arbitrary or is it based on the error inherent in the production process (like the mold used to hold the smelted glass)? 2.)

This ball is placed in a semispherical stone cup, which it fits almost exactly; moreover, there is a water jet at the bottom of the cup, so the stone is suspended on a film of water, making the friction of the ball with the cup almost 0; it is easy to set it in motion, and it keeps rotating in whatever way you start for a long time. Suppose now you are given access to this ball only near the top, so that you can push it to make it rotate around any horizontal axis, but you don't have enough of a grip to make it turn around the vertical axis. Can you make it rotate around the vertical axis anyway? I thought of answering it this way: Let $\mathbf B$ be a ball in $\Bbb R^3$, we want to prove that a rotation of $\alpha$ around the $x$-$axis$ composed with a rotation of $\beta$ around the $y$-$axis$, or the other way round, is equivalent to a rotation of $\theta$ around the $z$-$axis$.
Let $\mathbf v$ be a vector from the origin to a point $P$ on the surface of the ball.
The matrices $$[R_{\theta_{z}}]=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix} [R_{\alpha_{x}}]=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\  0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha \\\end{bmatrix} [R_{\beta_{y}}]=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta & 0 & -\sin\beta \\ 0 & 1 &0 \\ \sin\beta & 0 & \cos\beta \end{bmatrix}$$ represent the rotations around z, x and y respectfully. Now we want to prove that there exists $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $$ [R_{\alpha_{x}}][R_{\beta_{y}}]=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\  0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha \\\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}cos\beta & 0 & -\sin\beta \\ 0 & 1 &0 \\ \sin\beta & 0 & \cos\beta \end{bmatrix}=
 \begin{bmatrix} \cos\beta & 0 & -\sin\beta \\ \sin\alpha \sin\beta & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \cos\beta \\  \cos\alpha \sin\beta & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha \cos\beta \\\end{bmatrix}= [R_{\theta_{z}}]=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}  $$ or $$ [R_{\beta_{y}}] [R_{\alpha_{x}}]=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta & 0 & -\sin\beta \\ 0 & 1 &0 \\ \sin\beta & 0 & \cos\beta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\  0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha \\\end{bmatrix}
=
 \begin{bmatrix} \cos\beta & -\sin\beta \sin\alpha & \sin\beta \cos\alpha \\ 0 & \cos\alpha & \sin\alpha \\ \sin\beta & -\cos\beta \sin\alpha & \cos\beta \cos\alpha \\\end{bmatrix}= [R_{\theta_{z}}]=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}  $$
Analising the first case we get $ \sin\alpha =0 \\ \ \sin\beta =0 \\ \ \sin\theta= 0$ which implies $ \alpha = n_1 2 \pi + {\pi \over 2} \\ \beta = n_2 2 \pi + {\pi \over 2} \\ \theta = n_3 2 \pi + {\pi \over 2} $, for some integers $n_1,n_2,n_3$. Thus the composition of these maps does not get to all points of the circumference traced by the rotation around the $z$-$axis$. It's similar for the other composition. There's no way to rotate the in the vertical axis for all angles. Which seems to imply that there's no composition that does it. (The next exercise made me think this) But think of a telescope which can only rotate around it's base and up&down, I can imagine a way to rotate around a 3rd axis.This is a composition of two other rotations.

Then $g$ is smooth if and only if $f^{(n)}(0)$ is $0$ whenever $n$ is not an integral multiple of $3$. One direction is easy. Assume $g$ is smooth. Then we have $f(x)=g(x^3)$ for all $x$. Differentiating and using the chain rule gives that the required derivatives of $f$ vanish. I am struggling with the converse. Assume $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ whenever $n$ is not an integral multiple of $3$. We need to show that $g$ is smooth. Since $x^{1/3}$ is smooth at all points except $x=0$, we see that $g$ too is so. So the only problem is at $0$. I am only able to show that the first derivative of $g$ at $0$ exists. Here is what I have done. Let $x>0$ be arbitrary. By Taylor we know that
$$f(x)= f(0)+f'(0)x+ \frac{f''(0)}{2}x^2+ \frac{f'''(\lambda_x x)}{6}x^3$$

$$g(x)-g(0)=\frac{f'''(\lambda_{x^{1/3}} x^{1/3})}{6} x$$

$$\frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x}=\frac{f'''(\lambda_{x^{1/3}} x^{1/3})}{6}$$
Since $\lim_{x\to 0}f'''(\lambda_{x^{1/3}} x^{1/3}))$ exists, we see that $g'(0)$ exists. But I am not able to extend this argument to show that $g''(0)$ etc. also exist.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'smooth-manifolds', 'calculus']"

1957725,Domain Definition in Scaled Function,"Suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$. The graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points? If I look at the properties of functions using shifting / scaling, etc, then I can arrive at an answer for this question. I have a different doubt though - I am confused about the domain of definition of $f$. Since it is explicitly defined only for three points, wouldn't it be incorrect to evaluate the function for points not in the domain.","['functions', 'graphing-functions']"

1957794,Probability space in the Law of Large Numbers,"Suppose I have a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ and a random variable $X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Consider a random sample $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ of independent random variables with the same distribution as $X$. I was told that  $X_i:\Omega^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and $X_i(\omega)=X(\omega_i)$. Then, in the law of large numbers, $$(X_1+\cdots+X_n)/n\rightarrow E[X],$$

1957840,What is the definition of a complex manifold with boundary?,Can anybody help me to be clear about this definition. I know the definition of a real manifold with boundary (as in Lee's book) and the definition of a complex manifold (locally diffeomophic to an open set in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and transition maps are holomorphic). What is the definition of a complex manifold with boundary? I see it many times while reading about the complex-Monge Ampere equations on Kahler manifolds.,['differential-geometry']
1957873,One relator groups shortest word in quotient,"Suppose we have a group $\langle S \vert r \rangle \cong F_S /\langle \langle r \rangle \rangle$ where $S$ is a finite set of generators and $r \in F_{S}$, i.e. a finitely generated one realtor group. Suppose $r$ is cyclically reduced (i.e. $r \not = l^c$ for some $\vert l \vert_S < \vert r \vert_S$), then is there some $u \in \langle \langle r \rangle \rangle$ such that $0 < \vert u \vert_S < \vert r \vert_S$? I believe such a $u$ doesn't exist, however when getting pen and paper out to try and prove it I get a bit stuck (I have tried expressing such a $u$ as a product of conjugated copies of $r$ to play around for a contradiction, as well as a induction on the length of such an expression). I have looked up at the literature surrounding one relator groups and it seems like it is predominantly dealing with the groups themselves not the presentations. I expect the answer to be pretty trivial but I really can't see it, sorry! The actual question I care about has $u$ as a subword of $r$ (which might make it easier) but I was looking to see if the general question was solved and what methods where involved.","['geometric-group-theory', 'group-presentation', 'group-theory', 'free-groups']"

1957928,Conic Sections formulae using Complex Numbers,"I have been preparing for the JEE Examination here in India and have been studying Complex Numbers for the past few days. One of the topics which falls under Complex Numbers is their application in Coordinate Geometry (Conic Sections). These include the following: Equation of lines in different forms (parametric/non-parametric)$$$$
    Equations of Circles with various conditions (for example centered at $z_0$, or orthogonal to another circle and so on)$$$$
    Equations of Ellipses and Hyperbolas and so on. $$$$
There are several other applications/equations mentioned which I haven't written here. The trouble I'm facing is that the book I use for Complex Numbers (Algebra for JEE Main and Advanced, by SK Goyal) only has the formulae listed without showing the derivations. I find it extremely hard to just accept and use a formula/result without knowing how it came into existence. $$$$ I would be grateful if somebody could please mention a source/reference book from which I could actually learn how to derive/reach all the formulae used for represinting Conics using Complex Numbers. The book does not necessarily have to match the level of the JEE Advanced Examination; it can be higher than that too. However I would prefer it if the book was at the level suitable for the JEE Advanced level only. $$$$Many thanks in advance!

Edit:$$$$ The results mentioned in my book are as follows:
$$$$ $1) $The equation of the line joining $z_1$ and $z_2$ is $$z(\bar{z_1}-\bar{z_2})-\bar{z}(z_1-z_2)+ z_1\bar z_2-z_2\bar z_1=0 \text{ (non parametric form).}$$ $$$$ $2) $Three points are collinear if $$\begin{vmatrix}z_1&\bar{z_1}&1\\z_2&\bar {z_2}& 1\\z_3&\bar {z_3}& 1\end{vmatrix}=0$$ $$$$ $3)$$\bar{a}z+\bar z a+b=0$ where $b\in \mathbb R$ describes the equation of a straight line (I don't know what $a$ is, nor what $\iota b$ is). $$$$ $4)$ The real and complex slope (I don't know what is meant by 'real' and 'complex') of the line $\bar{a}z+\bar z a+b=0$  are $-\dfrac{\Re(a)}{\Im(a)}$ and $-\dfrac{a}{\bar a}$ where $b\in \mathbb R$. $$$$ $5) $If the lines $\bar{a}z+\bar z a+k_1=0$ and $\bar{b}z+\bar b a+k_2=0$ $k_1,k_2\in \mathbb R$ are perpendicular to each other, then $$\bar{a}b+\bar ba=0$$ $$$$ $6)$ $z\bar z +a\bar z +\bar az+k=0 $ where $k\in \mathbb R$ represents a circle with center $-a$ and radius $\sqrt{|a|^2-k}$. $$$$ $7)$ If $|z-z_1|+|z-z_2|=2a$ where $2a>|z_1-z_2|$ then $ z $ represents an ellipse with foci at $z_1 \text{ and }z_2$ and $a\in \mathbb R^+ $. $$$$ $8)$ If  $|z-z_1|-|z-z_2|=2a$ where $2a<|z_1-z_2|$ then $z$ represents a hyperbola with foci at $z_1$ and $z_2$. $$$$ $9)$ Equation of all circles orthogonal to $|z-z_1|=r_1\text{ and }|z-z_2|=r_2$ is (nothing further is mentioned). $$$$ $10)$ $\left |\dfrac{z-z_1}{z-z_2}\right | = k$ is a circle if $k\neq 1$ and will represent a line if $k=1$. $$$$ $11)$ The equation $|z-z_1|^2+|z-z_2|^2=k$ will represent a circle if $k\geq \frac12 |z_1-z_2|^2$. $$$$ $12)$ If $\arg\left(\dfrac{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)}{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}\right)=0, \pm \pi$, then the points $z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$ are concyclic.","['algebra-precalculus', 'conic-sections', 'complex-numbers', 'soft-question']"
