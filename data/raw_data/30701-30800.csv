287947,An example of uncountable set with zero Lebesgue measure,"It is known that there is a bijection between $\mathbb{I}$ and $\mathbb{I}^2$ (let's denote this map as $f$). Consider the set $X_0 = \{ (0, x) \mid x \in [0, 1] \}$ (just a vertical unit interval in $\mathbb{I}^2$). Now consider the set $Y_0 = f(X_0)$. If it is Lebesgue measurable, its measure $\lambda(Y_0)$ is zero. Proof by contradiction: suppose $\lambda(Y_0) = c > 0$, then we take countable number of unit intervals in $\mathbb{I}^2$, let them be $X_i = \{ (i, x) \mid x \in [0, 1] \}$ where $i$ indexes over rational numbers in $\mathbb{I}$ and map them. All $Y_i$ will be disjoint and in assumption of $Y_0$ being measurable, all $Y_i$ should be measurable and all $\lambda(Y_i)$ should be equal to $c$ (not sure how to prove it, but it's kind of intuitive. Or not?). Since $\bigcup\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{I}} Y_i \subset \mathbb{I}$, then $\lambda(\bigcup\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{I}} Y_i) = \sum\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{I}} c \le \lambda(\mathbb{I}) = 1$, which is obviously contradiction. However, I think it is very unlikely to such a set $Y_0$ to be Lebesgue measurable, but still, is there a way to prove its non-measurability? P.S. Yeah, I know about Cantor set, just trying to construct something myself.",['measure-theory']

With an infinite basis, I can define on a countable subset $\{e_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ a function $f(e_n)=n\|e_n\|$ and let $f(x)=1$ for all other basis vectors. Then this determines an unbounded linear functional, which is therefore discontinuous. But this argument, a, applies to any infinite-dimensional normed spaces, b, relies on the assumption of the axiom of choice.

288178,What am I reinventing? RE: Linear regression modeling for frequency of discrete events,"I'm looking to model the frequency of events to quantify how much that frequency is increasing or decreasing.  For the sake of concreteness think of the events as web page hits for several low traffic web sites, and I would like to compare how much they are ""trending"" up or down relative to one another.  My main question is what am I reinventing? In broad strokes this is the what I'm thinking.  I have a set of events at a set of times $E = \{t_1,...t_N\}$ with $t_i < 0$.  From these I have an event distribution function which is the sum of Dirac delta functions.
$$
\Phi(t) = K\sum_{i=1}^N\delta(t-t_i)
$$
where K is some normalizing factor. I would like to model this like a linear regression with $L(t) = at + b$ by minimizing $
\Vert{L-\Phi}\Vert$.  Older events should be weighted less, so my inner product measure would be something like:
$$
d\omega = e^{kt}dt
$$
Before I started digging out the details of this (the normalization, the inner product measure, etc.) I got the nagging suspicion that this has been done before :)  So my question is -- where can I read about the established theory, practice, and terminology for this type of problem?

288284,Hausdorff Dimension of Arbitrary Julia Set,"I am looking to find an exact solution to the Hausdorff dimension of a Julia set $J(f)$ for a polynomial $f: z \mapsto z^2 +c$ given an arbitrary $c$. I know this question is known for a number of special cases. For example, if the $c$ is on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it has dimension 2. The dimension for $c=0$ is obvious as well. Are there any other cases known exactly? If so, how are they found? I'd imagine there are a number of measurements using box-counting methods to approximate the dimension for various cases. Also, have there been efforts to calculate the dimension of a Julia set for any polynomial or rational function $p : \Bbb{C} \to \Bbb{C}$? Any knowledge of work done in this area or a place to start would be awesome. EDIT: Googling the question led to a number of papers. These are the results I have found: This paper gives the dimension of some set of points, although googling the word ""biaccesible"" only brings up that paper and references to it. This one shows that Julia sets for $c$ arbitrarily close to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set have dimensions arbitrarily close to 2. This one [pdf] gives a number of results: The dimension of $J(f)$ is less than 2 if $f$ has no non-periodic recurrent critical points The Julia set of rational $f$ is hyperbolic $\implies$ The Hausdorff dimension as a function of $c$ is continuous Some other results that seem to require another paper The introduction of this paper Says that for a rational $f$ we have yet to find a Julia set with positive area and doesn't contain the whole Riemann sphere. (Doesn't $z \mapsto z^2$ provide a counterexample? I'm not sure I understand this one) I also proves a result about the Julia set of a $\sin $ function. A paper from Harvard [pdf] gives ways of calculating the dimension numerically, and proves that the Hausdorff dimension is continuous from the Feigenbaum point (is this the same one from bifurcation diagrams?) to 1/4.

We have computed the fundamental group of the circle and we have proved that $S^{n}$ is simply connected for $n \geq 2$. This way we can prove the result if we replaced ""set"" with ""ball"". Indeed, an open ball in $R^{n}$ is homeomorphic to $R^{n}$, and $R^{2}$ can't be homeomorphic to $R^{n}$ for $n > 2$ because $R^{2} - \{x\}$ has non-trivial fundamental group while $R^{n} - \{y\}$ is simply connected. So I have been trying to prove that a given homeomorphism $f : U \rightarrow V$, $U \subset R^{2}, V \subset R^{n}$ open sets, can be restricted to give a homeomorphism between balls. We start by taking a point $u \in U$. Take a ball $B_{1}$ around $u$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a ball $A_{1}$ around $v = f^{-1}(u)$ such that $f(A_{1}) \subset B_{1}$. Since $f^{-1}$ is continuous, there exists an open ball $B_{2}$ around $u$ such that $f^{-1}(B_{2}) \subset A_{1}$. Thus clearly $B_{2} \subset f(A_{1})$. However, I'm not sure how to proceed here.

288319,What is a tangent bundle? (Aubin),"Here's what I read in A Course in Differential Geometry by Thierry Aubin. 2.5. Definition. The tangent bundle $T(M)$ is $\bigcup_{P\in M} T_P(M).$ And then 2.6. Definition. Let $\Phi$ be a differentiable map of $M_n$ into $W_p$ (two differentiable manifolds). Let $P\in M_n,$ and set $Q=\Phi(P).$ The map $\Phi$ induces a linear map $(\Phi_*)_P$ of the tangent bundle $T_P(M)$ into $T_Q(W)$ defined by $$[(\Phi_*)_PX](f)=X(f\circ\Phi);$$ here $X\in T_P(M),\;(\Phi_*)_PX\in T_Q(W)$ and $f$ is a differentiable function in a neighbourhood $\theta$ of $Q.$ We call $(\Phi_*)_P$ the linear tangent mapping of $\Phi$ at $P.$ I don't understand why the author calls $T_P(M)$ a tangent bundle in the second definition. Is it a mistake? From the first definition, a tangent bundle is the union of all tangent spaces over all points of the manifold. And $T_P(M)$ is just one tangent space, at a particular point $P$ . And an additional question: Should I be worried whether the union in the first definition is disjoint or not?

Find all symmetric $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices. It is symmetric, meaning the matrix $A$ should look like $A=\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ b & c\end{bmatrix}$. Thus, by working out $A^2$ I find that $a^2 + b^2 = 0$ and
$ab + bc = 0$. This tells me that $a^2 = - b^2$ and $a = -c$.
I'm not sure how to progress from here. 2)Suppose $A$ is a nilpotent $2\times 2$ matrix and let $B = 2A$ - I. Express $B^2$ in terms of $B$ and $I$. Show that $B$ is invertible and find $B$ inverse. To find $B^2$ can I simply do $(2A -I)(2A - I)$ and expand as I would regular numbers?
This should give $4A^2 - 4A + I^2$.
Using the fact that $A^2$ is zero and $I^2$ returns $I$, the result is $I - 4A$. From here do I simply use the original expression to form an equation for $A$ in terms of $B$ and $I$ and substitute it in? Unless I am mistaken $4A$ cannot be treated as $2A^2$ and simplified to a zero matrix. 3) We say that a matrix $A$ is an idempotent matrix if $A^2 = A$. Prove that an idempotent matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $A = I$. I have no idea how to begin on this one. 4) Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are idempotent matrices such that $A+B$ is idempotent, prove that $AB = BA = 0$.

Can anyone spot my mistake? Suppose $F$ is a field with four elements, as $0, 1, a, a^2$, and $\chi$ a nontrivial character on $F$.  Thus we must have $\chi(0) = 0, \chi(1) = 1$, and we can assume $\chi(a) = \zeta$ and $\chi(a^2) = \zeta^2$, where $\zeta = e^{2\pi i /3}$.  This is because $\chi$ sends a nonzero member of $F$ to a third root of unity, so the only other homomorphism (which would be $\chi^2$) would interchange where $a$ and $a^2$ are sent. Now the Gauss sum of $\chi$ is given by $g(\chi) = \sum\limits_{t \in F} \chi(t)\zeta^{tr(t)}$, where $tr$ is the trace function, defined by $tr(t) = t + t^2$.  The trace function has its range equal to $\mathbb{Z}_2 \subset F$, each member of which is interpreted as the corresponding $0$ or $1$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We have $tr(0) = 0, tr(1) = 1 + 1^2 = 0$.  Also $tr(a) = a + a^2 = 1$, and $tr(a^2) = a^2 + a^4 = a^2 + a = tr(a) = 1$. Thus the Gauss sum is $\chi(0)\zeta^{tr(0)} + \chi(1)\zeta^{tr(1)} + \chi(a)\zeta^{tr(a)} + \chi(a^2)\zeta^{tr(a^2)} = 0 + 1 + \zeta \zeta + \zeta^2\zeta = 1 + \zeta^2 + 1 = 2 + \zeta^2$. But $\zeta^2 = e^{2 \pi i (2/3)} = Cos(4 \pi / 3) + i Sin(4 \pi / 3) = -1/2 - i\sqrt{3}/2$, whence $g(\chi) = 1.5 - \sqrt{3}i/2$, meaning $|g(\chi)| = \sqrt{2.25 + 3/4} = \sqrt{3}$.

from A to B are there:

(a) which are a surjection? 
(b) which are an injection 
(c) which are a bijection, 
(d) which have f(1) = a, 
(e) for which ∃x ∈ A, f(x) = b, 
(f) for which 1 and 5 have the same image, 
(g) for which two elements of A have the image c, and three elements have the image e. I was just wondering if someone could give me a little advice with how I'm working through these, and some tips on how to go through the question. For (a) I treated it like a Stars and Bars question, where the size was 6 (size of B) and the amount of gaps was 5 (size of A) and you could have ones where certain ones in A didn't do anything, so the formula would be $\binom{5 + 6 - 1}{5 - 1}$. Is that right? For (b) I was confused with whether or not injection means ALL of the ones in the domain must match to unique ones in the codomain, or if for instance, one matching to one in the codomain counts as a separate one, such as f(1) = b, and f(1) = a count as two separate functions. How would I tackle this one? c) I figured 0, because $|B| > |A|$ d) I figured 1 was a mandatory option now, so that left us with 4 other numbers to match with (to 6 different letters). Considering that something else could still equal a, just 1 couldn't, I considered it another Stars and Bars question and said $\binom{4 + 6 - 1}{4 - 1}$ e) I know this means that b will always have a value in the domain linking to it, but I'm not sure how to tackle it. f) and g) I'm not sure how to tackle either.
