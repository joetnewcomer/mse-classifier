1489859,Sine Derivatives of High Orders,"I want to ask whether my answer, and assertions are true. I think that, for $n\ge0$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$: If $n\equiv1\pmod{4}$, then $\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}[\sin x]=\cos x$ If $n\equiv2\pmod{4}$, then $\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}[\sin x]=-\sin x$ If $n\equiv3\pmod{4}$, then $\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}[\sin x]=-\cos x$ If $n\equiv0\pmod{4}$, then $\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}[\sin x]=\sin x$ For my problem, to find $\dfrac{d^{87}}{dx^{87}}[\sin x]$, I came up with $-\cos x$.

Each engine is searching over the same set of 2,000 documents and returning the top 20 hits. I'm trying to construct a hypothesis test where $H_0$ is the hypothesis that the search results are being randomly generated by both engines (i.e., that the results of one search engine are independent of the results of the other search engine). My first strategy is to answer the question: If I select 20 numbers at random (and without replacement) from the integers 1 to 2,000 to form one hitlist, and repeat to form another hitlist of 20, how likely is it that they these two lists will share $0 \leq X\leq 20$ hits in common?

1490088,Why do we represent groups in the category of vector spaces?,"For any category $\mathcal{C}$ and any object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, $\operatorname{Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$ is a group.  Thus, given any group $G$, it makes sense to talk about representing $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$ as automorphisms of some object in $\mathcal{C}$. Yet, while this makes sense for any category, categories of vector spaces (usually over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) seem to have come to play a significantly more prominent role in mathematics than other choices of categories. My first thought is that this is the case because categories of vector spaces are incredibly well-understood, and so representations on vector spaces can be used to obtain information about the group much more easily than, say, representations on manifolds (i.e. actions by diffeomorphisms). But is there a more mathematically fundamental reason why categories of vector spaces seem to have a most prominent role in mathematics when it comes to representations of groups?","['group-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'category-theory']"

1490376,Find sum of series $\sum _{ n=1 }^{ \infty }{ { (-1) }^{ n+1 }\left( \frac { n+2 }{ { n }^{ 5 } } \right) } $ correct to 3 decimal places.,"This is a question I came across while studying on Khan Academy: Find the sum of the series $\sum _{ n=1 }^{ \infty  }{ { (-1) }^{ n+1 }\left( \frac { n+2 }{ { n }^{ 5 } }  \right)  } $ correct to three decimal places. I solved this by calculating ${ S }_{ 1 },{ S }_{ 2 },{ S }_{ 3 },...\\ $ until I had a close enough value (bad method, I know).
Anyway, here is the solution steps given in the answer: Note that this is a convergent alternating series. The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem states that the error bound in the sum of the first $n$ terms is the absolute value of the first omitted term; i.e., $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| $. To obtain three-digit accuracy, we need to find $n$ such that $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| <\ 0.0005$, or equivalently $\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } <0.0005$. When $n=6$, we have $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| =\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } =\frac { 9 }{ 16807 } \approx .000535$; that is not accurate enough. When $n=7$, we have $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| =\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } =\frac { 10 }{ 32768 } \approx .000305$; that will give a final result within $0.0005$. Thus we need to find the sum of the first seven terms of the series. $$\sum _{ n=1 }^{ 7  }{ { (-1) }^{ n+1 }\left( \frac { n+2 }{ { n }^{ 5 } }  \right) \approx 2.8914 } $$ Hence, $2.891$ is accurate to three decimal places. What I don't understand about this answer is if the estimate is $2.8914$ and the error bound is $0.000305$, I think the actual sum can be close to $2.8914+0.000305\approx 2.891705\approx 2.892$. Then the result above is not correct. Does this answer take into account the fact that the $(7+1)th$ term is negative? Or is there something about rounding and error bounds that I don't understand? Thank you.","['approximation', 'sequences-and-series']"

1490506,Properties of group acting such that each non-trivial element fixes no point or exactly $p$ points,"Let $p$ be a prime and $G$ a faithful non-regular transitive finite group acting on $\Omega$ with $|\Omega| > p$ such that some element fixes no point, and that each nontrivial element fixing some point fixes exactly $p$ points. Also assume that for $g \notin N_G(G_{\alpha})$ we have 
  $$
 G_{\alpha}^g \cap G_{\alpha} = 1
$$
  and $p$ divides the order of $G_{\alpha}$. Let $\overline \alpha := \mbox{fix}(G_{\alpha})$ be the set of points fixed by $G_{\alpha}$ and assume that a Sylow $p$-subgroup $S$ of $G$ fixes $\overline \alpha$ and acts semi-regulary on $\Omega \setminus \overline \alpha$. a) Show $N_G(S) \subseteq N_G(G_{\alpha})$ and $N_G(S)' \subseteq G_{\alpha}$, b) $G$ has a normal subgroup $F$ of index $p$ [Hint: Grün's Theorem], c) Show that $F$ has $p$ orbits and acts as a Frobenious group on these orbits. Some facts I know: i) $S$ has order at least $p^2$. As $S$ acts semi-regulary on $\Omega \setminus \overline \alpha$ for each orbit $\Delta \subseteq \Omega \setminus \overline \alpha$ of $S$ we have $|\Delta| = |S : S_{\beta}| = |S|$ with $\beta \in \Delta$. Let $k$ denote the number of these orbits, and as $S$ fixes (1) $\overline \alpha$ 
$$
 |\Omega| = |\overline \alpha| + k\cdot |S| = p + k \cdot |S|
$$
and hence $p$ divides $|\Omega|$. As $G$ acts transitive $|\Omega| = |G : G_{\alpha}|$. So $p$ divides the index of $G_{\alpha}$ in $G$ and the order of $G_{\alpha}$, therefore $S$ has order at least $p^2$ as a Sylow $p$-subgroup. ii) $G_{\alpha}$ has index $p$ in its normalizer. Let $k = |N_G(G_{\alpha}) : G_{\alpha}|$. Then if $g \in N_G(G_{\alpha})$ we have $G_{\alpha} = G_{\alpha}^g = G_{\alpha^g}$, so that $G_{\alpha}$ fixes all points $\alpha^g$ with $g \in N_G(G_{\alpha})$, and the orbit of the normalizer has size $|N_G(G_{\alpha}) : G_{\alpha}|$. So at least $k$ points are fixed by $G_{\alpha}$. Further as $\alpha^g = \alpha$ implies $G_{\alpha} = G_{\alpha}^g$ exactly $k$ points are fixed by $G_{\alpha}$. By $h \in N_G(G_{\alpha}^g) \Leftrightarrow (G_{\alpha}^g)^h = G_{\alpha}^g \Leftrightarrow G_{\alpha}^{ghg^{-1}} = G_{\alpha} \Leftrightarrow ghg^{-1} \in N_G(G_{\alpha}) \Leftrightarrow h \in N_G(G_{\alpha})^g$ the normalizers of conjugates to $G_{\alpha}$ are isomorphic, hence $|N_G(G_{\alpha}^g) : G_{\alpha}^g| = k$ and we see that each conjugate of $G_{\alpha}$ fixes also exactly $k$ points. Let $g \in G$ and denote by $l$ the number of conjugates of $G_{\alpha}$ which contain $g$. By the above the number of points fixed by $g$ is precisely $kl$. But as the conjugates intersect trivially, if $g \ne 1$ and $g$ fixes some point then $l = 1$, and so $g$ fixes exactly $k$ points, i.e. the number of points fixed equals the index, and by supposition the number of points equals $p$, hence $k = p$. So this is all I got, hoping you can help me to solve the points a), b) and c)! (1) I guess this means $\overline \alpha^S = \overline \alpha$, i.e. $\overline \alpha$ is a union of orbits under $S$, and not necessarily that $S$ fixes each point from $\overline \alpha$. But note that either $S$ fixes each point from $\overline \alpha$, or if one point is not fixed, then $\overline \alpha$ must be an orbit of $S$ as $|\overline \alpha| = p$ and the size of each orbit must divide $|S|$. But maybe the case that $S \le G_{\alpha}$ could be excluded somehow. .","['permutations', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-actions']"

$$\lambda^2+0 \lambda+1=0$$

$$\lambda =\frac{\sqrt{-4}}{2}=\frac{i\sqrt{4}}{2}=\pm i$$

$$x_p(t)=A \cos(\omega t)+B \sin(\omega t)$$ Now I take the derivative of my guess.
$$x_p'(t)=-A \sin(\omega t) \cdot \omega+B \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega$$
$$x_p''(t)= -A \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2-B \sin(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2$$ The I have replace it in the equation
$$-A \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2-B \sin(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2 + A \cos(\omega t)+B \sin(\omega t) = 3 \cos(\omega t)$$ Since we have no $\sin(\omega t)$ on the RHS the B must be $0$ on the LHS. Then
$$-A \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2 - A \cos(\omega t) = 3 \cos(\omega t)$$ And isolate A
$$A\big(- \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2-\cos(\omega t)\big)=3 \cos(\omega t)$$
$$A=\frac{3 \cos(\omega t)}{- \cos(\omega t) \cdot \omega^2-\cos(\omega t)}$$
$$A=\frac{3 \cos(\omega t)}{\cos(\omega t)\big(-\omega^2-1 \big)}$$

  is given by $$ R = \left( \lim \sup_{n \to \infty} | c_n |
 ^{\frac{1}{n}} \right)^{-1} .$$ The following are some questions I have encountered. I mention them so as to show my logic to solve these problems. I hope that you can give me some instructions. For example, I want to find the radius of convergence of $\sum z^{n!}$. I checked in MSE, and found the solution using ratio test. Then I came across the problem of finding R of $\sum (n+2^n)z^n$. And now I am stuck when using Cauchy Hadamard formula. Then I come up with this solution: Note that $$\sum (n+2^n)z^n = \sum nz^n + \sum (2z)^n.$$ The first sum
  will converge for $|z|<1$ and the second sum would converge for
  $|2z|<1$, i.e. $|z|<0.5$. Hence, $R= 0.5$.
  Is there any problem? I also have the following problem: Suppose $\sum c_n z^n$ has a radius of convergence R. Find the radius
  of convergence of $\sum n^p c_n z^n$. Again, I make use of the Cauchy Hadamard formula $\lim \sup_{n \to \infty} | n^pc_n | ^{\frac{1}{n}}$. But I don't know what can be done for that.

In the Lie Groups course that I'm currently studying, we use the latter definition, so $T_aM$ is the vector space of all tangents vectors at $a$ and has a basis
$$\left\{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right)_a\right\}$$
where we are using coordinates given by $\varphi$, and
$$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right)_a (f) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{\varphi(a)}.$$ Most of the answers on this site (all the ones that I can find, at least) talk about how to find the tangent space explicitly using the path definition, but I'm interested in doing it with this definition.
I know that they are probably very similar (if not the same, up to notation), but I'm struggling to understand it, and would appreciate a concrete example. Here is the example I'm trying to work through, with the aim of finding the Lie algebra of $G$ coming from the tangent space at the identity: Let $G$ be the $3$-dimensional Lie Group of matrices of the following form:
  $$G = \left\{\left(\begin{array}{cc}A&a\\0&1\end{array}\right) : A\in \mathrm{O}(2),a\in\mathbb{R}^2\right\}.$$
  We know that $A\in\mathrm{O}(2)$ can always be written as exactly one of
  $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{array}\right)\quad\text{or}\quad\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&-\cos\theta\end{array}\right)$$
  for $\theta\in(0,2\pi]$, and so $\psi\colon A\mapsto\theta\det A$ is a coordinate chart on $\mathrm{O}(2)$, giving us the coordinate chart $\varphi\colon B\mapsto(\theta\det A,a_1,a_2)$, where $B\in G$. So the basis of $T_eG$ acts on $C^\infty(G)$ by
  $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right)_e(f) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{\varphi(e)} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{(2\pi,0,0)}$$
  where $f\in C^\infty(M)$. Questions: Is the above right? How can I continue from here (after making any corrections from question 1.).","['smooth-manifolds', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-algebras']"

The question is to prove this theorem by a probabilistic approach. My idea is as follows :
Let $|V|=n,|W|=m$, then the maximum number of possible edges between $W,W^C$ is $m\times(n-m)$. The maximum number of possible edges in graph $G$ is $C_n^2 = \frac{n!}{2!\times(n-2)!}$. We can treat the edges as if they were randomly scattered in the $C_n^2$ positions, and with probability $p=\frac{m\times(n-m)}{C_n^2}$ one edge would connect $W,W^C$. Then it is like a Bernoulli trial of $|E|$ times with success probability $p=\frac{m\times(n-m)}{C_n^2}$, and the probability there are at least $\frac{|E|}{2}$ edges connecting $W,W^C$ is $\sum\limits_{k = \left\lceil {\frac{1}{2}|E|} \right\rceil }^{|E|} {C_{|E|}^k{p^k}{{(1 - p)}^{|E| - k}}} $.

1491045,Topology $\text{i})$ What is a topology? $\text{ii})$ What does a topology induced by a metric mean?,"I am now trying to understand what a topology and a topological space is.
Yes, I know the ""formal"" or ""mathematical definition"" of it, it is in my notes so it's easy for me to reiterate that. Please bear with me as I am trying my best to express my confusion, it's a little hard to even do that in words. Here's the definition I am sticking to $X$ is a set. A topology on X is a set of subsets $\tau$ of $X$ with the following properties Whenever $(U_{i})_{i \in I}$ is a family(finite or not) of subsets of $X$ such that $U_i \in \tau$ , $\forall i \in I$ then $\cup_{i \in I}U_i \in \tau$ Whenever $U_1$ , $U_2 \in \tau$ then $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \tau$ . $\phi \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$ $i$ ) So my problem is,for each 1,2,3 conditions, I understand what they mean. So each subset in $\tau$ satisfies 1,2,3, which as a whole, is some subset of $X$ and we'll just name it ""a topology"" on $X$ ...yes? My issue is, I don't see what this ""collectively"" gives. So if you are to explain it to someone who does not really do math, and explain it casually, what would you say? what does this ""set of subsets"" give? Is it nothing more than ""just the set of subsets that satisfy 1,2,3, end of story""?
That is probably one of the reason why I cannot find a topology for any specific given set. I just don't know how. $ii$ ) And also, the notion of induced topology by a metric is unclear to me.
The ""discrete topology"" as I hear very often, is apparently one of the most common topology which is induced by the discrete metric. In my notes, it says The discrete topology of $X$ is the collection of all subsets of $X$ , which is the largest possible topology on $X$ . So, if I take a set of positive integers $X=\mathbb{Z}^+$ then the discrete topology is $\{\mathbb{Z}^+, \phi,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},...,\{1,2\},\{1,3\},...,\{2,3\},\{2,4\},...,\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},...\}$ ?
But even if it is, how is this ""induced by the discrete metric? How is it relevant? I could have just blindly followed the definition of a topology to get all these subsets...right? without using or referring to any metric. $iii$ ) And what is a topological space? And yes, I ""know"" it's $(X, \tau)$ where $\tau$ is a topology on $X$ but again, I can't help but confuse when I think of ""metric spaces"" Metric space so far makes a lot more sense to me. I see $d(x,y)$ , a metric as a function, so when we say a metric space $(X,d)$ just as how we phrase $(X,\tau)$ ,I understand it as a set $X$ with some function $d(x,y)$ which can be ""applied"" to the elements of $X$ to ""give a value"", which is the ""distance.""
So it's a set $X$ where I have given a ""method"" to tell how far any 2 elements are in it. Now, $(X, \tau)$ doesn't sink in to me because $\tau$ , unlike $d(x,y)$ doesn't do anything to $X$ (does it?). Meaning, it's just a set in a sense(with some special features) but does not allow me to ""pick some value in $X$ "" to give me ""some value""(whatever it is). So it comes to, as stupid as it may sound, ""what is the point of having $\tau$ ""?
Ultimately...just what is a ""topological space""? A pair of sets $X$ and $\tau$ ?
If it is analogous to the metric space, $d(x,y)$ ""defined"" on $X$ , what would it mean that $\tau$ ""defined"" on $X$ ? I hope expert topologists would understand what I am confused with an where I have the wrong way of thinking. I really need someone to enlighten me here, it's just getting so abstract to me..

Irreducible components of $Y$ defined by $x^2 - yz$ and $xz - x$,"From Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry , exercise 1.3: Let $Y$ be the algebraic set in $\mathbb A^3$ defined by the two polynomials $x^2 - yz$ and $xz - x$. Show that $Y$ is a union of three irreducible components. Describe them and find their prime ideals. I'm aware this problem has been looked at before, but my concern with it is a little different. Specifically, every solution I can see comes up with a different set of prime ideals from the ones I did, and I can't figure out exactly why the ideals I came up with don't work (assuming they don't, which is my intuition based on a vaguely-remembered idea of how the uniqueness of primary decomposition is supposed to work). I agree with the logic of the correct answers I've seen, but I can't figure out whether that means my logic was wrong, and if it does, where the issue is. I'm inclined to start from the direction of algebra, so my reasoning went like this: $Y$ is the zero set of the two given polynomials by definition, so it's the zero set of the ideal generated by them, $(x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. The generating element $x^2-yz$ is irreducible and the other generating element $xz - x$ factors into the irreducibles $x(z - 1)$; since these three elements are irreducible in $k[x, y, z]$ and this ring is a UFD, the ideals generated by them are prime. The product of coprime ideals is the same thing as their intersection, and clearly the product of any pair of these three ideals is coprime to the third one, which means that the product of these three prime ideals is equal to their intersection, and it seems like that should be exactly $(x^2 - yz, x, z - y) = (x^2 - yz, xz - x)$. (I say ""seems like"" because this is the best candidate I have for where my reasoning is incorrect). This ideal is also a radical ideal, since it's an intersection of prime ideals. This means that $I(Y) = (x^2 - yz) \cap (x) \cap (z - 1) = I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))$ where each of the three ""Z(ideal)""'s is irreducible since the ideal is prime. Thus $\overline{Y} = Z(I(Y)) = Z(I(Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1))) = Z(x^2 - yz) \cup Z(x) \cup Z(z - 1)$, which should finish the problem since $Y$ is defined as an algebraic set, so it's already closed by definition.","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'zariski-topology']"

Since $p$ is prime, the group $G=(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic. Therefore, 
$G^n=\{x^n : x \in G\} = <g^n> = <g^k>$ where $k=\gcd(m,n)$ where $m$ is order of $G$. 
In this case, $m=p-1$ so $k=\gcd(p-1,n)$ I don't know how to proceed further however. Any help would be appreciated!","['group-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1491104,Generalized Cantor Set - how much being left behind at each iteration?,"Let $F$ be the subset of $[0,1]$ constructed in the same manner as the Cantor set except that each of the intervals removed at $n$th iteration has a length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{n}}$ with $0<\alpha<1$ rather than $\frac{1}{3^{n}}$. I've been told that on each iteration, each of the intervals removed has length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{n}}$, but that the total length of $F$ is $1-\alpha$. I'm trying to show this by taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ of the length of the intervals left behind at each iteration. For example, on the second iteration, the way I see it, two intervals of length $\frac{\alpha}{3^{2}}$ should be removed, so the length left behind would be $1-\frac{\alpha}{3} - \frac{2\alpha}{9} = 1-\frac{5\alpha}{3^{2}} = 1-\left(\alpha-\frac{2\alpha}{3}\right)$. So, my question is, a I correct in assuming that after the $n$th iteration, what is left behind will be $1-\left(\alpha - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}\right)$, which, as $n \to \infty$, converges to $1-\alpha$?","['lebesgue-measure', 'cantor-set', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1491146,Probability that a person is infected if test is positive?,"I have the following problem: $0.5$ % of a population are infected with a dangerous virus. A diagnostic test for the identification of the virus is positive in $99$ % for infected people and in $2$ % for not infected people. Please estimate the probability that a person whose test was positive is infected with the virus. And this is my solution. Since $0.5$ % of the population is infected, then $99.5$ % is not infected. Since $99$ % of the tests on infected people is positive, then $1$ % is negative. Similarly, we can conclude that $98$ % of the tests in not infected people is negative. What we need to find, probability that a person whose test was positive is infected with the virus or in other words that a person is infected given that the test was positive , can be expressed (using the Bayes' theorem) as $$p( P_I \mid T_P) = \frac{p(P_I)\cdot p(T_P \mid P_I)}{p(T_P)}$$ Where $P_I$ means person is infected and $T_P$ means tests are positive . Now, we know $p(P_I)$ , that is $\frac{0.5}{100} = 0.005$ , and we also know $p(T_P \mid P_I) = \frac{99}{100} = 0.99$ . We only need to find $p(T_P)$ , that is the probability that tests are positive . For this purpose, we can use the law of the total probability in the following way: $$p(T_P) = p(P_I)\cdot p(T_P \mid P_I) + p(\overline{P_I}) \cdot p(T_P \mid \overline{P_I}) = 0.005 \cdot 0.99 + 0.995\cdot 0.02 = 0.02485$$ We can now plug the numbers in the first equation $$p( P_I \mid T_P) = \frac{0.005 \cdot 0.99}{0.02485} = 0.19919517102615694$$ That is the probability that person is infected given that the tests are positive is roughly $20$ %.

1491220,Show $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{(a^h-1)}{h}$ exists without l'Hôpital or even referencing $e$ or natural log,"Taking as our definition of exponentiation repeated multiplication (extended to real exponents by continuity), can we show that the limit $$\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists, without l'Hôpital, $e$, or even natural logarithm? Sure, l'Hôpital will work, but that's circular if we're developing calculus of transcendentals from first principles. There is a good answer to this question already by user Neal, but he uses the exponential function with base $e$ (it's been answered many times: see also here , here , and here ). But using the special properties of $e$ strikes me as circular too; not literally logically circular, in the sense that we are invoking results we're trying to prove, since there are definitions of $e^x$ which make it trivial to verify the derivative. But perhaps pedagogically circular for a complete novice, the special properties of $e$ appear unmotivated because they cannot be justified without reference to the very derivative we are trying to compute (or else a detour through logarithms, but let's not). Can we find nice squeeze theorem bounds like Neal has, but for the function $a^x$ instead of $e^x$, with the additional handicap that we can't just write $a^x=e^{x\log a}$? I thought to substitute a series expansion for $\log a$, but didn't come up with any bounds that were nicely polynomial in both $x$ and $a$. I wonder whether the geometric proof of $\lim (\sin x)/x$ (see for example, robjohn's answer here ) could be adapted. Obviously without a reference to natural logarithm, we cannot compute the value of the limit. But I just want to show it exists (via squeeze theorem or monotone convergence). Once we know this limit exists, we can show it behaves like a logarithm, whence there is a unique base for which the limit is 1, which we call $e$. The rest of the development of calculus of exponentials and logs follows easily. This seems like the approach that would appear the most accessible yet motivated to a novice calculus student. An analogous limit to $\lim\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$ for understanding to differentiating exponential functions, are the limits $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^n$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^{n+1}$ for differentiating the logarithm, if you prefer to start with that as your primitive concept. Both limits are shown to exist using Bernoulli's inequality (see WimC's answer here for the first limit, and see David Mitra's answer here for the second limit). I tried without success to use Bernoulli's inequality to show my sequence was monotone. This limit can also be analyzed using the AM-GM inequality as seen in user94270's answer to this question . So that inequality may help here. I would also accept an explanation of why the limit cannot be computed without transcendental techniques, or an opinion why this is not a pedagogically sound approach to introducing the calculus of exponentials and logarithms. Edit: This question has a nice solution by Paramanand Singh to a closely related problem.","['education', 'calculus', 'limits', 'limits-without-lhopital', 'exponential-function']"

A infinite amount of trivial examples can be shown by manipulating the same transcendental, like shown in the answers and in the comments, but I was intrigued by what I believed being the question's true aim, the non-trivial results. After fiddling around with some algebra to try and understand the nature of  transcendental extensions, then proceed to read about it during the day, I reached the known result that it depends on wheter or not the two given transcendental numbers are algebraically independent. If they are, then we cannot generate a 'non trivial algebraic' transformation between them that yields a algebraic number (i.e. using only the four basic operations). It's just a question of stating a polynomial with rational coefficients whose roots are the given transcendental numbers. Now to the real question. From Nesterenko 's results [1996] we know the independence of $\pi$, some values of the Gamma $\Gamma$ function and some powers of $e^\pi$. From the unproved Schanuel's conjecture follows that $\pi$ and $e$ are independent. Are there examples of more notable (conjectured or known) algebraically independent transcendental numbers?

I think I can prove this but I'm not sure if my proof is correct or rigorous. Well obviously if $a=b=0$ then $x=0$ which is rational. Now proving it the other way. If $x$ is rational then either $x$ is $0$ or $x$ is not $0$. If $x$ is $0$ then
$$b\sqrt5 = -a\sqrt3$$
$$\frac{b}{-a} = \frac{\sqrt3}{\sqrt5}$$
But the LHS is Rational while the RHS is not. You can see this by assuming $\frac{\sqrt3}{\sqrt5} = \frac mn$ for some integers $m,n$. Then $3n^2=5m^2$ but if you factorize $m, n$ into primes you'll see that the power of 3 is one greater on the LHS than it is on the RHS. This contradicts the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. So it must be that $x$ is Rational but not $0$. Not $100\%$ sure that this step is correct though. So then $$a\sqrt3 = x-b\sqrt5$$
$$3a^2=x^2-2bx\sqrt5+5b^2$$
$$\frac{3a^2-x^2-5b^2}{-2bx}=\sqrt5$$
If $a,b\neq0$ then the LHS is rational since the quotient of rationals is rational as long as the denominator is not 0. However the RHS is irrational since the sqrt of a prime is irrational. So we cant's have $a,b\neq0$ If $a=0$ but $b\neq0$ then same deal. LHS rational, RHS irrational. So we can't have $a=0$ but $b\neq0$. If $b=0$ but $a\neq0$ then simply start with the equation $b\sqrt5 = x-a\sqrt3$ and you will get a similar contradiction.

Is it as simple as saying that any constant multiplied by a divergent series is a divergent series? What could be my value for $\delta$ that proves this to be true?","['limits', 'functions']"

That question was unanswered, but it seems to me infinitely many circles of radius $1/2, 1/3, 1/4...$ can fit into a unit disk. The area of all those circles would be $\pi \sum_2^\infty 1/n^2 = \pi^3/6 -\pi$, which is less than the area of the unit disk $\pi$.

If it is wrong, could anyone please point the mistakes out? let $x=\cos{\theta}, y=\sin{\theta}$, so by changing the variable, we have the new integration area $X=\{(z,\theta): 0\leq z \leq 2-\cos{\theta} - \sin{\theta}, 0\leq\theta\leq2\pi\}$, and the integral becomes:
$$\iint_{S} xdydz + ydzdx + zdxdy = \iint_{S} \left[\cos{\theta}(-\cos{\theta})+\sin{\theta}(-\sin{\theta})\right]dzd\theta

I can see why it lies in this intersection but cannot see at all why it is determined exactly by this intersection. Also, there have been other questions like this in the book and they've mostly involved a bit of algebra, but there doesn't seem to be any pattern in them and I'd be pretty at a loss of the examples weren't quadratic, but say cubic.

1491911,"Two sets of three integers, whose sum of squares are equal, and sum of fourth powers are equal","Consider the following two constraints on a set of integers:
$$a^2+b^2+c^2=d^2+e^2+f^2$$
$$a^4+b^4+c^4=d^4+e^4+f^4$$ There are simple solutions like $a^2=b^2=c^2=d^2=e^2=f^2$, or pairs are the same value.  But is it possible for the squares of these variables to all be distinct? The best I've been able to come up with so far, is that if there are integers $x,y,z$ such that

This is encouraging because it reduces the number of variables, however I'm not sure if that's just a dead end, because I can't show that all solutions must have this form, and I don't know how to choose $x,y,z$ such that so many linear combinations of them form squares.

1491962,Geometric argument why rotation followed by reflection is reflection?,"Consider the dihedral group, that is, group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon. Note that a rotation either leaves all points fixed (identity roation) or moves all points except the rotation axis. Also note that a reflection fixes all the points on the line of reflection. Using this I can argue why rotation composed with rotation is again a rotation: there is exactly one point that's fixed if we compose two rotations and that the axis of rotation so the composition of two rotations is again a rotation. Similarly it is clear why two reflections composed are a rotation: each reflection fixes a line and the points that are fixed by the composition is the intersection of the two lines which is a point. Now I tried to do the same to argue why a reflection followed by rotation (or vice versa) is a reflection. But the problem is that say, we have a non-identity rotation it moves all points except the centre of rotation. Then applying the reflection I don't see why this should fix a line.

1491999,Local degree of a polynomial defined on the Riemann sphere at a root,"I'm working on a problem from Hatcher's Algebraic Topology, and I want to show that if we take polynomial $f(x)$ definded on the Riemann sphere mapping to the Riemann sphere, the local degree of the map (when viewed as a map $S^2 \to S^2$) at a root is equal to the multiplicity of the root. Intuitively this seems obvious because if we look at a neighborhood of some root with multiplicity $n$ and translate the function to the origin, we get a map that kind of looks like the map $z \to z^n$, given a sufficiently small neighborhood, which has degree $n$ as desired. My problem is making my claim rigorous because the polynomial does not map perfectly from $z \to z^n$ in the neighborhood. I'm not sure how to compute the local degree directly. I know it means looking at the induced map $H_2(U,U-x_0) \to H_2(f(U), f(U)-0)$ where $x_0$ is a root and $U$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$.","['algebraic-topology', 'complex-analysis']"
