723341,Exponential Distribution with changing (time-varying) rate parameter,"In short, how would one sample an Exponential Distribution with an exponentially-increasing rate parameter, e.g., $\lambda=e^t$ ? What distribution does such a random variable follow? Background: The Exponential Distribution models ""time until failure"" of, say, lightbulbs. It is parametrized by a constant parameter $\lambda$ called the failure rate that is the average rate of lightbulb burnouts. If $\lambda$ is time-varying, say, proportionally to a power of time, then it turns out that the time until failure is distributed by the more general Weibull distribution. This question involves this relationship, although the time-variance of $\lambda$ is not made explicit. My question is: What if $\lambda$ varies exponentially in time? Is there a distribution for this case? More simply, how would I sample a random variable that is exponentially distributed with time-varying rate parameter $\lambda = e^t$ ?

723347,Something that isn't continuous can be proven to be continuous (so it is continuous - definitions - but doesn't look it!),"I'm sorry to post this, either I am right and it is continuous, or because I am on $\mathbb{Q}$ not $\mathbb{R}$ that saying ""if that delta works, any smaller delta will!"" (which can be proven by by some * value theorem) does not work. Consider this, now I was trying to prove it isn't continuous, I am now convinced it is. $f:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\{1,2\}$ (I chose 1 and 2 to make the sketch nicer) given by $f(x)=1$ if $x<\sqrt{2}$ and $f(x)=2$ otherwise/$x>\sqrt{2}$ - it is important that this change happen about a number in $\mathbb{R}$ but not $\mathbb{Q}$. Now I remember when proving the continuity of 1/x over a year ago, I learnt that it is helpful (necessary) to bound delta above when you have points of discontinuity, this stops it getting too close, it also keeps it to one side of the discontinuous point. I seek to prove $\forall\epsilon>0\exists\delta>0:|x-a|<\delta\implies|f(x)-f(a)|<\epsilon$ to mean continuous at $a$. Now that upper bound I mentioned, because this function is flat I don't need to find a smaller delta that's a function of epsilon and take the minimum. The proof is trivial. Let $\delta=|\sqrt{2}-a|$, now if $|x-a|<\delta$ I am saying in words ""The distance from x to a is less than the distance from a to that nasty point"" which means $x\in(a-\delta,a+\delta)$ which is clearly a ... chunk of the domain either entirely before that $\sqrt{2}$ or after. On this $f(x)-f(a)=0$ which is less than $\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$, thus I have proved that this function is continuous. EVEN though it has a jump in it! It is continuous on $\mathbb{Q}$ What I think I have learnt I think I have learnt that while 1 and 2 seem far apart for real numbers, or even fractions, in the set {1,2} there is no middle value. So the jump is not actually a jump at all. With this I am not sure if the $\sqrt{2}$ thing is actually significant. If we had a function that was 1 if $x\le\frac{1}{2}$ say, else 2. does this have the ""no-jump"" quality? I can see a case for no, if $\epsilon<1$  then no it cannot be continuous, because there can be a change near $x=\frac{1}{2}$ by a value of more than one, no matter how small $\delta$ (at x=0.5). HOWEVER it might be yes. If you say ""the change must be -1,0 or 1"" thus confining $\epsilon$ to take 1, it is still no (as 1 is not less than 1) but one could question whether it is fair to try and impose this ""less than"" on {1,2} in this way. If it ever changes there can be no smaller jump. I am reading about the issue, I'm posing this because my foundations have somewhat crumbled, I'd like some help patching them back up. My apologies for the naff format/style of this question, it suffers from me thinking about what I am writing and flicking between several different ways and making sure it is consistent.

723393,$f$ continuous nowhere implies $f$ not Riemann integrable,"I am trying to prove the statement in the title, without using the theorem which says that the set of discontinuities of a Riemann integrable function must have measure $0$.

Attempt: Consider $f:\;[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ where $f$ is continuous nowhere on $[a,b]$. We want to show $\mathcal{U}_{f,\mathcal{D}}-\mathcal{L}_{f,\mathcal{D}}\geq (b-a)\eta$ for some $\eta>0$, where $\mathcal{U}_{f,\mathcal{D}},\mathcal{L}_{f,\mathcal{D}}$ are the upper & lower Darboux sums for any partition $\mathcal{D}=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}:\;a=x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_n=b$ of $[a,b]$.

\begin{equation}
G/H = \{ g H \mid g \in G \}

G \times H = \{ (g,h) \mid g \in G \text{ and } h \in H \}

Since $h_1H=H$ for some $h_1 \in H$, we have:
\begin{equation}
(g,h)H = (g',h')H \iff g=g' \text{ and } h' = h h_1 \tag{1}
\end{equation}
and so without loss of generality we can write every element of $K/H$ in the form $(g,e_H)H$. Now, let the map:
\begin{equation}
f : G \to K/H
\end{equation}
be defined by:
\begin{equation}
f(g) = (g,e_H) H \tag{2}
\end{equation}
The map is one-to-one. This can be seen by equation $(1)$, because if:
\begin{equation}
f(g) = f(g')
\end{equation}
then:
\begin{equation}
(g,e_H) H = (g',e_H) H \implies g=g'
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the map is trivially onto:
\begin{equation}
\forall (g,h) H \in K/H \; \exists \; g \in G \; , \; f(g)=(g,h) H
\end{equation}
and thus the map is bijective. Finally, the map is also a homomorphism, because:
\begin{equation}
f(gg') = (gg',e_H) H = (g,e_H)(g',e_H) H = (g,e_H)(g',e_H) HH = (g,e_H) H (g',e_H) H = f(g) f(g')
\end{equation}
and so $f$ is a isomorphism. Thus, by definition of equation $(2)$, we have shown that $G  \simeq K/H$. Any input is much appreciated.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Then $f(\theta_{0})=0$ whenever f is continuous at the point $\theta_{0}$. They prove the theorem by contradiction - assuming that $f$ satisfies the hypotheses, $\theta_{0}=0$, and $f(0)>0$. They then construct a family of trigonometric polynomials $\{p_{k}\}$ that peak at $0$, resulting in $$\int p_{k}(\theta)f(\theta)\; d\theta \rightarrow \infty \;\; \text{as}\;\; k \rightarrow \infty.$$ Here, the peak functions are constructed in the following manner: Since $f$ is continuous at $0$, we can choose $0 < \delta \leq \pi/2$, so that $f(\theta)>f(0)/2$ whenever $|\theta|< \delta$. Let $p(\theta) = \epsilon + \cos\theta$ where $\epsilon >0$ is chosen so small that $|p(\theta)|< 1-\epsilon/2$, whenever $\delta \leq |\theta| \leq \pi$. Then choose a positive $\eta$ with $\eta < \delta$, so that $p(\theta) \geq 1 + \epsilon/2$, for $|\theta| < \eta$. Finally, we define $p_{k}(\theta) = [p(\theta)]^k$.

(As usual, we denote its identity element by $0$.) $(Q\setminus\{0\},\cdot)$ is a loop . (Its identity element will be denoted by $1$.) Left distributive law: $a\cdot (b+c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c$ for all $a,b,c\in Q$. Each equation $a\cdot x = b\cdot x + c$ with $a,b,c\in Q$ and $a\neq b$ has a unique solution $x\in Q$. Now the Wikipedia article claims that One can prove that the axioms imply that the additive group (Q,+) is abelian. My question is: How? For ordinary rings, we are in a similar situation. It is possible to drop the commutativity of the addition from the axioms, since it follows from the other axioms: $a + b = b + a$ is implied by $$ a + a + b + b = (a\cdot 1 + a\cdot 1) + (b\cdot 1 + b\cdot 1) \overset{\text{L}}{=} a\cdot (1 + 1) + b\cdot (1+1)\\\overset{\text{R}}{=} (a+b)\cdot (1+1) \overset{\text{L}}{=} (a+b)\cdot 1 + (a + b)\cdot 1 = a + b + a + b.
$$ This is not too bad in our situation, since the proof doesn't rely on the associativity of the multiplication (which we don't have in a quasifield).
However, the problem is that both distributive laws have been used (tagged with L and R). More precisely, step R is not covered by the above axioms.
I wonder if we can find an alternative justification for that equality based on property 4, which looks a bit related to the missing right distributive law.","['abelian-groups', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

Here is my proof that this functional is bounded. The partial derivative $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(z)$ is also harmonic, therefore by the mean value propery and Green's theorem we have
$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(0)=\frac{1}{\pi r^2}\int_{D(0,r)} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(x,y)dxdy= \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int_{\partial D(0,r)}hdy  $$
$$= \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int_0^{2\pi} h(re^{it})r \cos tdt$$
This implies
$$ r^2|\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(0)|\leq \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} |h(re^{it})|rdt$$
and integrating from $0$ to $R$ yields
$$\frac{R^3}{3}|\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(0)|\leq \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{D(0,R)}|h(w)|dA(w) $$
By Cauchy Schwarz we have
$$|\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(0)|\leq\frac{3}{\pi R^3} (\pi R^2)^{1/2} \int_{D(0,R)} |h(w)|^2dA(w)=\frac{3}{\sqrt{\pi}R^2}\int_{\mathbb D}|h(w)|^2dA(w)$$ Letting $R\to 1$ gives that the operator norm is $\leq  3/\sqrt{\pi}$.

Claim:If $A,B$ are compact disjoint subsets of the Hausdorff space $X$, then there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ containing $A,B$ resp. Would I be on the right track in saying that since $A,B$ are compact subsets of $X$ then choose $\{\mathbb{A}_\alpha \}$, $\{\mathbb{B}_ j \}$ to be open covers for $A,B$ resp. Then since $X$ is Hausdorff we have that for each $x$ in $\{\mathbb{A}_\alpha \}$ and $y \in \{\mathbb{B}_j \}$ there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$. Now if we take $U = \cup_{x \in \mathbb{A}_\alpha} U_x$ and $V = \cup_{y \in \mathbb{B}_j} V_y$ we have our disjoint open sets. Comment: However, I didn't uses the fact that $A,B$ were disjoint, or that they are closed, since every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed. Can someone give me some useful hint? This is hw, so I don't want and answer. Thanks in advance.",['general-topology']
724365,Is this differential form closed / exact?,"Could you check if I calculated the exterior derivative of this differential form $\omega$ correctly? $\omega \in \Omega_2 ^{\infty} (\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\})$ $\omega = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}(x \mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z + y \mbox{d}z \wedge \mbox{d}x + z \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y)$ $\mbox{d} \omega = \mbox{d}( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}x (\mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}(y \mbox{d}z \wedge \mbox{d}x ) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}( z \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y))$ We differentiate the fist summand only by $x$, second only by $y$ and the third only by $z$, because in the other cases we get forms like $\mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}x$, and due to the fact that exterior derivative is antisymmentric such forms are zero. So: $\mbox{d} \omega = \left( - \frac{3}{2} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-5}{2}} 2x \cdot x + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}\right) \wedge \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z + \left( - \frac{3}{2} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-5}{2}} 2y \cdot y + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}\right) \wedge \mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z \wedge \mbox{d}x +  \left( - \frac{3}{2} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-5}{2}} 2z \cdot z + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{-3}{2}}\right) \wedge  \mbox{d}z \wedge \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y$ Because $\mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z = \mbox{d}y \wedge dz \wedge dx = \mbox{d}z \wedge \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y$ (we need two transpositions), we have: $\mbox{d} \omega = \left( -3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) ^{\frac{-5}{2}} (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) ^{\frac{-3}{2}} \right) \mbox{d}x \wedge \mbox{d}y \wedge \mbox{d}z$
But this isn't equal to zero. Are my calculations correct? I have one more question - how do determine if this form is exact? I know a differential form $\omega \in \Omega_n (U)$ is exact if there exists $\beta \in \Omega_{n+1} (U)$ s. t. $\omega = \mbox{d} \beta$. But I don't know how to guess such $\beta$.

Let $ F(a,b) :=\displaystyle\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\log\left(a^2\cos^2\left(x\right)+b^2\sin^2\left(x\right)\right)\,{\rm d}x$ For fixed $b$, and letting $g(t) = F(t,b)$ I am trying to justify $g'(t) = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \dfrac{2t\cos^2(x)}{t^2\cos^2\left(x\right)+b^2\sin^2\left(x\right)}\,{\rm d}x$ In order to justify this, I need to show $f(t,b) :=\log\left(t^2\cos^2\left(x\right)+b^2\sin^2\left(x\right)\right)\,{\rm d}x$ is integrable over $[0,\pi/2]$ $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ exists for all $t,x$ There exists a dominating function such that $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t} \leq g$, a.e and $g \in L^1([0,\pi/2])$ I'm thinking 1) is straightforward since it's continuous, hence measurable, and since it's on a finite interval we can conclude that it is also integrable. $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \dfrac{2t\cos^2(x)}{a^2\cos^2\left(x\right)+b^2\sin^2\left(x\right)}$ so 2) is satisfied In regards to finding a dominating function, can MVT be used here? I'm also having some trouble evaluating the integral $g'(t)$, but $F(a,b) = \pi \log \left(\dfrac{a+b}{2}\right) \ \ (a,b>0)$ should be the solution.","['lebesgue-integral', 'integration']"

Let $f(a,b,c)=a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc$. $f(0,0,0)=0$, $f(1,0,0)=1$, $f(1,1,0)=2$, we get that $0,1,2\in S$ p.s. I find a solution for $a,b,c \geq0$: $n=2^rp_1^{r_1}\dotsb p_s^{r_s}$, $p_1< p_2<...$ are odd primes, then a suficient and necessary condition for $n$ can be expressed as $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc$($a,b,c \geq0$) is $p_1>3$ or $p_1=3$ with $r_1\geq2$","['elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
724995,Confused with $\mathbb Q$-rational points,"Look at the following enlightened part of a proof extracted from a paper (here $C$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$): Clearly  $\mathbb Q\subset C$ and $\mathbb P^1_C$ is a scheme over $\mathbb Q$ thanks to the fibered product: $$\mathbb P^1_C=\mathbb P^1_\mathbb Q\times_{\operatorname{Spec \mathbb Q}}\operatorname{Spec}  C$$
 but I don't understand why there exists a $\mathbb Q$-rational point on $\mathbb P^1_C$. We should have a  morphism $\operatorname{Spec }\mathbb Q\longrightarrow \mathbb P^1_C$ over $\mathbb Q$, but who does ensure that it really exists? A similar problem arises here (now note that $C=\mathbb C$): In this case the author wants $K$-rational points in $\mathbb P^1_\mathbb C$!

725004,Question about $ \int_{-1}^{0}\sum_{n=1}^{x}n^sdx=\zeta (-s) \forall s\in \Bbb N$,"what I found from messing around was 
$$
\int_{-1}^{0}\sum_{n=1}^{x}n^sdx=\zeta (-s)
$$
$$
s\in \mathbb{N}
$$
when the partial sum is changed to an equivalent polynomial using Faulhaber's formula. For example 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{x}n^3 = \frac{x^2(x+1)^2}{4}
$$
and 
$$
\int_{-1}^{0}\frac{x^2(x+1)^2}{4}dx = \frac{1}{120} = \zeta(-3)
$$ 
This is pretty much my first time in the realm of the zeta function, so i wasn't sure if this was obvious, or a given thing. But I couldn't find any reference to it online.
What I'm asking is why this is and what I should search for if I want to learn more about this.","['calculus', 'zeta-functions', 'number-theory', 'summation', 'bernoulli-numbers']"
725025,"Is $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sin x \, \mathrm{dx}$ divergent or convergent?","I was determining whether $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sin x \, \mathrm{dx}$$ was divergent or convergent. So, I did the following steps: $$\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sin x \, \mathrm{dx} &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\sin x \, \mathrm{dx}+\int_{-\infty}^0\sin x \, \mathrm{dx} \\
&=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} \left(-\cos x |^{t}_{0}\right) + \lim_{a\rightarrow-\infty} \left(-\cos x |^{0}_{a}\right)\\
&=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} -\cos (t) + \cos 0 + \lim_{a\rightarrow-\infty} -\cos 0 + \cos a\\
&=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}1 - \cos t + \lim_{a\rightarrow-\infty} -1+\cos a
\end{align}$$ Now, at this point, it would be reasonable to say that both the limits are undefined and therefore, the integral is divergent but then if I try something like the following \begin{align}
\quad\quad&=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}1 -\cos t + \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty} -1+\cos a \\
\quad\quad&=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}-1 -\cos t + \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty} \cos a+1 \\
\quad\quad&=\lim_{b\rightarrow\infty}-1 +\cos b - \cos b+1 \\
\quad\quad&= 0
\end{align} So, as you can see, it was shown before that the integral is divergent but with some manipulation, we came at an answer of $0$ but is that valid? I assume, a similar technique can be applied to $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, \mathrm{dx}$.","['improper-integrals', 'calculus']"
725041,"Why is one proof for Cauchy-Schwarz inequality easy, but directly it is hard?","Let's say you are in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and you define the norm as $||x||=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2...+x_n^2}$. This we recognize as the usual norm from the inner product: $||x|| = \sqrt{\langle x, x \rangle}$, where $\langle x, y \rangle = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2+ \cdots + x_n y_n$. It is easy to check that this satisfies all the axioms for an inner product. Then we may define orthogonality as a zero inner product, and we get the Pythagorean theorem, we define projection, and then the proof for Cauchy–Schwarz is pretty straight forward. But now comes my problem. Lets say you do not want to go through the inner product, but you still want to prove Cauchy–Schwarz. When you do not have an inner product, Cauchy–Schwarz do not make much sense, but I want the part where we have replaced the inner-product part. I mean, Cauchy–Schwarz says:
$|\langle x, y \rangle| \le ||x|| \cdot ||y||$. This equation makes sense even without inner-products for our case: $\left| x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \cdots + x_n y_n \right| \le \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2} \cdot \sqrt{y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \cdots + y_n^2}$ However I am not able to prove this inequality. For me, it is easier going through the inner product for proving this, but I want to be able to prove this inequality directly, how am I supposed to do that? That is, my problem is proving that $\left| x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \cdots + x_n y_n \right| \le \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2} \cdot \sqrt{y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \cdots + y_n^2}$ without going through the inner product. Is this hard? Would you say it is easier defining the inner-product and proving it in that way? It seems weird that it should be easier to define a lot of new terms just to prove an inequality.","['vector-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
