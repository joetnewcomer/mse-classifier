274864,Does the singular locus of a conical variety (or scheme) determine the singular locus of its projectivization?,"Lets say $X$ is a conical affine algebraic variety (conical meaning $X$ is the zero set of homogeneous polynomials of positive degree, equivalenty $X \subsetneq k^n$ and $x \in X \Rightarrow ax \in X$ for all $a \in k$) and $\mathbb P(X)$ is the projectivization of $X$ (the projective variety defined by the same homogeneous equations as $X$). Clearly the origin $0 \in X$ is a singular point.  If $a \neq 0$ is a nonsingular point of $X$ then is the line through $a$ a nonsingular point of $\mathbb P(X)$? More generally, if $A$ is a graded Noetherian ring generated in degree $1$, and $\mathfrak p \in \mathrm{Proj} \ A$ is a homogeneous prime ideal such that the point $\mathfrak p \in \mathrm{Spec} \ A$ is regular, then is $\mathfrak p$ regular in $\mathrm{Proj} \ A$?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'projective-schemes']"

274873,(yet another) length of random segment,"Take a random point $Z$, i.d. in [0,1], which defines a stick. Break the stick in two, (random i.d.). Take the left part of the broken stick and break it again in two (i.d.) You thus obtain three sticks. What is the expected length of the stick where $Z$ is located? (Prove its $5/9$. Can you come up with an intuitive reason for that?) Generalise for n breaks of the stick in the left (i.e. always breaking the segment near the origin).

274883,Are there any statistics texts which give both intuition AND justifications for the equations/methods?,"Background:  I took multiple statistics classes in both high school and college, but nothing I learned ever stuck.  The problem is, things like p-tests, the equations for chi-squared/normal distributions, even the standard deviation are always simply presented as fact, without any proof/justification/motivation for why this equation/method is the correct one. Often, this is because the books are written for people looking to simply apply statistics rather than truly understand it.  Usually, not even a calculus-background is assumed, despite the underlying equations being calculus-heavy. Non-calculus example: Why is the standard deviation not defined as the average distance from the mean , when that is the more intuitively obvious definition?  I still don't quite understand the answer to that one... I did find some books that do go deeply into proofs in my college's mathematics library, but even those were heavy on symbols and light on justifications/motiviations (as well as real-world examples) Does anyone know of any statistics books that not only go over the equations/methods, but explain in detail why they are what they are?","['statistics', 'reference-request']"
274885,Question on the Condorcet Ranking (Schulze Method) Algorithm,"I've been doing some research on ranking algorithms, and I've read theresearch with interest.

However, upon implementation, I'm having trouble showing that ties do not occur when using the algorithm. I've put together a below real-life example, in which the result looks to be a tie. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Is the solution simply to randomly select a winner when there is a tie? Could you somoene please have a look and offer any advice?

$$f_1=f_2=1, f_{n+2}=f_n+f_{n+1} \phantom{a} (n\ge 1)$$
A few months ago I found an interesting inequality;
$$\forall N\in\mathbb{N};\phantom{a}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{f_n}{f_{n+1}}>\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}N\quad\cdots (1)$$
This can be proved amazingly simple; Let $\displaystyle S_N=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{f_n}{f_{n+1}}$ and $\displaystyle T_N=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}$. By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $S_N T_N> N^2$. Using the given recurrence relation we can easily prove that $T_N<S_N+N$. Combining two results, $(N+S_N)S_N>T_N S_N>N^2$, so $S_N^2+NS_N-N^2>0$. Solving this quadratic inequality, we get $\displaystyle S_N>\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}N$. After proving (1) I tried to find the upper bound of the sum by using similar method. I finally found
$$\forall N\in\mathbb{N}; \phantom{a}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}<\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}N+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n}\quad\cdots (2)$$

274935,How to compare the similarity between functions?,"I'm designing a web service that finds the regression function of a pattern within an image.

Function 3 is very narrow and is concave up (whereas functions 1 and 2 are concave down). How can I compare these three functions and mathematically determine that the curves of functions 1 and 2 are more similar?

Given a finite dimensional vector space $V$, it is often remarked that there is no ""natural"" isomorphism from $V$ to $V^*$ (I guess this means a basis independent isomorphism?).

This isn't a homework problem, it's straight from the solutions manual (it just doesn't tell me why the proof is actually solved). The Proof: If $x$ is an even integer, then $x^2$ is even. Proof . Suppose $x$ is even. Thus $x=2a$ for some $a\in\mathbb Z$. Consequently $x^2=(2a)^2=4a^2=2(2a^2)$. Therefore $x^2=2b$, where $b$ is the integer $2a^2$. Thus $x^2$ is even by definition of an even number. I'm confused on the third line. I understand that $x^2=2b$, but why do we need to know ""where $b=2a^2$, and why do we need to know it? How did we even get that value? Shoot, I think I just got it as I typed it out...

275038,Base-point-free invertible sheaves on smooth projective curves,"Let $C$ be a projective curve over $k$ (geometrically integral, nonsingular). I am confused about the following argument in Vakil's notes on algebraic geometry: (1) In (20.6.2), he writes: Fix a curve $C$ of genus $g = 2$.  Then $\omega_X$ is degree $2g-2 = 2$, and has 2 sections (Exercise 20.2.A).  I claim that $\omega_X$ is base-point-free.  We may assume $k$ is algebraically closed [...].  If $p$ is a base point of $\omega_X$, then $\omega_X(-p)$ is a degree 1 invertible sheaf with two sections, which Proposition 20.4.1 shows is impossible. I am not completely sure what he means by $\omega_X$ having two sections, but I assume he just means $h^0(X, \omega_X) = 2$.  Now indeed $\deg(\mathscr{L}(-p)) = \deg(\mathscr{L} \otimes \mathscr{O}_X(-p)) = \deg(\mathscr{L}) - 1$ since $p$ has degree 1.  However, since $p$ is a base point of $\omega_X$, we have
$$ h^0(X, \omega_X) - h^0(X, \omega_X(-p)) = 1 $$

I am confused if I got it right: If the metric is defined by pullback, then the volume form is also a pull-back of a form on $N$? So in my case the corresponding form on $N$ is $\frac{\mathrm{dx\wedge d\theta}}{x^2}$? Is this correct with the above definitions? Did I compute the volume form correctly?

$$\frac{e^{-\frac{t}{4}}}{(4\pi t)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \int_0^\infty \frac{x e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\sinh(\frac{x}{2})}dx = \frac{1}{4 \pi t} \left(1 -\frac{t}{3} + O(t^2) \right).$$ He gives no proof for it, so I decided to do my homework and compute it. My approach consisted in defining: 
$$f(t):= \frac{e^{-\frac{t}{4}}}{(4\pi t)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \int_0^\infty \frac{x e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\sinh(\frac{x}{2})}dx.$$ Then in computing its Taylor expansion in $t=0$. The first term of the Taylor expansion follows easily (see below in ""My progresses""). To compute the second term of the expansion I need: $$ \partial_t(f(t))_{t=0} = \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \partial_t(f(t))= \lim_{t\rightarrow 0 } -\frac{f(t)}{4} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\cdot\{\text{Limit above}\}.$$ This is why I'm interested in the limit above. The conjectured result follows by McKean statement and $\underset{t \rightarrow 0}{\lim} f(t) =1$. My progresses: A useful partial result I have got is the limit, for $n$ odd:
$$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\: \frac{1}{t^{\frac{n}{2}}} \int_0^\infty \frac{x^n e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}{\sinh(\frac{x}{2})}dx=\left(\prod_{i=1}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\frac{2i-1}{2}\right)2^n \sqrt{\pi}.$$ Which I use to compute the first term of the Taylor expansion. Applying it to the ""main"" limit we see that it is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$. But applying L'Hopital rule we erase the $\frac{1}{t}$ from the denominator just to get it again from the derivative of the numerator, and we come back to the $\frac{0}{0}$ situation. I iterated the rule for some steps but it doesn't seem to bring anywhere. Remark: I'm actually interested in the expansion as in McKean, so if you have any way to compute it avoiding the limit above for me it would be a completely satisfying answer. Moreover if you see any error I made to get to the limit  I would be very grateful if you could point it out. Thank you very much in advance!","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

275073,Equivalence of Norms Defined on a Cartesian Product,"While studying some notes on normed vector spaces, I have come upon the proof that addition $+:V \times V\to V$ of vectors in a normed vector space $V$ is a continuous operation. The proof of this fact is quite easy except of (in my opinion) one step: the choice of the norm on $V \times V$. The proof has been done for a norm defined as $\|(v_1,v_2)\| = \|v_1\| + \|v_2\|$ and a comment has been made that certain other norms (e.g. $\|(v_1,v_2)\| = \max\{\|v_1\|,\|v_2\|\}$) can be used as well, since they generate the same topology (the product topology, I suppose). However, I struggle with the question what is the precise set of all norms that can be used in this proof. I suppose that the theorem has to be interpreted in the way that $+$ is continuous with respect to the product topology. Thus, my question can be restated as follows: given a norm $\|\cdot\|$ on $V$ generating a topology $\tau$, which norms can be used on $V \times V$ to generate the product topology with respect to $\tau$? I do not find this question to be straightforward, since in infinite dimensional spaces, norms need not be equivalent. Thank you in advance.","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

Try to show that $$\ker(f_\phi g_\phi)=\ker(f_\phi)\oplus\ker(g_\phi)$$ The sketch of the proof Notice that sub-ring $K[\phi]\subseteq\operatorname{End}(V)$ is commutative, and $f_\phi,g_\phi\in K[\phi]$, so it's easy to show that $\ker(f_\phi),\ker (g_\phi)\subseteq\ker(f_\phi g_\phi)$. $\because\gcd(f,g)=1$, $\therefore\exists u,v\in K[x]: uf+vg=1\implies u_\phi f_\phi+v_\phi g_\phi=I_V$, where $I_V$ is the identity operator of $V$. $\forall x\in\ker(f_\phi g_\phi)$, plug $x$ into the preceding equation, we have $x=u_\phi f_\phi(x)+v_\phi g_\phi(x)$, and it's not quite difficult to show that $u_\phi f_\phi(x)\in\ker(g_\phi)$ and $v_\phi g_\phi(x)\in\ker(f_\phi)$, so $x\in\ker(f_\phi)+\ker(g_\phi)$. $\forall x\in\ker(f_\phi)\cap\ker(g_\phi)$, plug $x$ into that equation and we have $x=0$, so $\ker(f_\phi)\cap\ker(g_\phi)=0$, Q.E.D Thoughts It seems that the proposition is quite similar to Chinese Remainder Theorem, say:

275276,Inspecting the function $f(x)=-x\sqrt{1-x^2}$,"We are just wrapping up the first semester calculus with drawing graphs of functions. I sometimes feel like my reasoning is a bit shady when I am doing that, so I decided to ask you people from Math.SE. I am supposed to draw a graph (and show my working) of the function $f(x)=-x\sqrt{1-x^2}$: Below is my work, I'd be very grateful for any comments on possible loopholes in my reasoning (the results should be correct), thanks! $$\text{1. } f(x)=-x\sqrt{1-x^2}$$ Domain : We have a square-root function, therefore we need $1-x^2\geq0$. From that we get$x\in[-1,1]$. As this is the only necessary condition, $D(f)=[-1,1]$. The function is also continuous on this interval as there is nothing that would produce a discontinuity. Symmetry : $f(x)$ is an odd function, as $-f(x)=f(-x)$, as demonstrated here:
$$-f(x)=f(-x)$$
$$-(-x\sqrt{1-x^2})=-(-x)\sqrt{1-(-x)^2}$$
$$x\sqrt{1-x^2}=x\sqrt{1-x^2}$$ Therefore we are only interested in the interval $[0,1]$, as the function will behave symmetrically on $[-1,0]$. x and y intercepts : $f(x)=0$ holds when $x=0,1$, those are then the x-intercepts . Thus also the y-intercept is at $(0,0)$ First derivative $$\begin{align}
\ f'(x) &=(-x\sqrt{1-x^2})' \\
 & = (-x)'\sqrt{1-x^2}+(-x)(\sqrt{1-x^2})' \\ 
 & = -\sqrt{1-x^2}+(-x)\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-x^2}}(-2x) \\ 
 & = -\frac{1-x^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}+\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\ 
 & = \frac{2x^2-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \\ 
\end{align}$$ Local minima and maxima: The equality $\frac{2x^2-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}=0$ yields $x=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$. As $f(\frac{1}{\sqrt2})=-\frac{1}{2}$ and because we know the x-intercepts, we can conclude that this is the local minimum and the function is decreasing at $x\in [0,\frac{1}{\sqrt2})$ and increasing at $x\in(\frac{1}{\sqrt2},1]$. That can also be concluded from the fact that $f′≤0$ on the interval $[0,\frac{1}{\sqrt2}]$ and $f′≥0$ on the interval $[\frac{1}{\sqrt2},1]$. Second derivative $$\begin{align}
\ f''(x) &=(\frac{2x^2-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}})' \\
 & = \frac{(2x^2-1)'\sqrt{1-x^2}-(2x^2-1)(\sqrt{1-x^2})'}{1-x^2} \\ 
 & = \frac{4x\sqrt{1-x^2}-(2x^2-1)\frac{-x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}}{1-x^2} \\ 
 & = \frac{4x\frac{1-x^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}-(2x^2-1)\frac{-x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}}{1-x^2} \\ 
 & = \frac{\frac{-2x^3+3x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}}{1-x^2} \\ 
 & = \frac{-2x^3+3x}{\sqrt{(1-x^2)^3}} \\ 
\end{align}$$ Inflection point and concavity : $f''(x)=0$ has only one result and that is $x=0$. If we look at the inequality for $x\in(0,1]$.
$$\begin{align}
\ 0&<f''(x) \\
0&<\frac{-2x^3+3x}{\sqrt{(1-x^2)^3}} \\
0&<-2x^3+3x \\
2x^3&<3x \\
2x^2&<3 \\
x^2&<3/2 \\
\end{align}$$ We can see that $x^2<3/2$ is satisfied on $x\in(0,1]$, thus the function is convex on this interval. Conclusion: Using the symmetricity of the function, we can conclude that the function is increasing on $[-1,-\frac{1}{\sqrt2}]$ and $[\frac{1}{\sqrt2},1]$ and decreasing on $[-\frac{1}{\sqrt2},\frac{1}{\sqrt2}]$. It has local minimum at $x=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ and local maximum at $x=-\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$. It is concave on $[-1,0]$ and convex on $[0,1]$, with point of inflection at $x=0$.",['calculus']

$ := |x-Px|^2 - 2|(x-Px,  y) |^2 + |(y, x-Px)|^2 =|x-Px|^2 - |(x-Px, y) |^2 $ Which implies that distance of $x$ from $Px+y \in Y$ is less than the $|x-Px|$ , unless $|(x-Px, y) |^2 =0$ which gives us that $x$ and $x-Px$ are orthogonal . Now let us see if $P : x \to Px$ is linear , 
Define $Qx =x-Px$ , We have already shown that $Qx$ is orthogonal to $Y$ Then $P(ax+by)+Q(ax+by) =ax+by =a(Px+Qx)+b(Py+Qy$, moving $P$ and $Q$ on two sides we get 
$P(ax+by)-(aPx +bPy) = Q(ax+by) -(aQx+bQy)$, since the right side is in $Y$ and the left side is not in $Y$, both the side should be equal to $0$ , $P(ax+by)-(aPx +bPy)=0$ , hence we show that $P$ is linear . And the boundedness follows because $|x|^2=|Px|^2+|Qx|^2$ , is that right ? Am i right so far ? I am having a bit of difficulty in proving rest of the stuff.

down quite a number of tricks, which in my opinion were 'outrageous' :-). Meaning there

$$ \min (a,b)= \frac{a+b-|a-b|} {2} $$ To prove Hölder's inequality (in its simplest case)
You write $\int (f+tg)^2 \geq 0$ and since this stays positive
you get that the discriminant of this must be negative, and magically
you get your Hölder inequality. When you want to show something about distinct zeroes of complex functions you kind of eliminate the zeroes of f by dividing them with the appropriate Möbius transforms and you still get an analytic functions which has nice properties.

275581,"Exercise 2.8 in Mackay's Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms","[Editing question per Leon's suggestions - thanks for these!] Could someone walk me through a solution to Ex 2.8? 2.7:  Bill tosses a bent coin $N$ times, obtaining a sequence of heads and tails.  We assume that the coin has a probability $f_H$ of coming up heads; we do not know $f_H$.  If $n_H$ heads have occurred in $N$ tosses, what is the probability distribution of $f_H$? ...What is the probability that the $N+1$th outcome will be a head, given $n_H$ heads in $N$ tosses? 2.8:  Assuming a uniform prior on $f_H$, $P(f_H)=1$, solve the problem posed in 2.7.  Sketch the distribution of fH and compute the probability that the $N+1$th outcome will be a head, for
(A) $N=3$ and $n_H$=0;
(B) $N=3$ and $n_H=2$;
(C) $N=10$ and $n_H=3$;
(D) $N=300$ and $n_H=29$. {tip about the beta integral} Where I am stuck is with the switch to continuous probabilities, and using integrals rather than sums.  Had no problem with 2.4; 2.5 took some doing but was fine.  The example in 2.6 made sense walking through it. In working on 2.8, I can write down that posterior = (likelihood x prior) / evidence, and know that I am trying to solve for posterior (to find the distribution of $f_H$).  So my equation will look something like $$P(f_H |\,n_H, N) = {P(n_H|\,f_H, N) P(f_H) \over P(n_H|\,N)}$$. The left hand side of the numerator should just be the binomial probability ${N \choose n_H}$ $f_H^{n_H}$ $(1-f_H)^{N-n_H}$  Based on the statement in the question, I assume that $P(f_H) = 1$ and ignore it. The denominator is the marginal probability of $n_H$.  I believe this should be an integral - something like $\int_0^1 P(f_H) P(n_H |\,f_H, N) df_H$.  But I am not sure that this is correct, and am not sure how to solve it, even with the hints. I did notice that 2.7 is an example and the additional assumptions - but need help here too.

f'(x)= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(x+h)- f(x-h)}{2h}. $$ It is given that the derivative of $f$ at $x$ exists.

275603,How do I show that two sets are equal.,"This is an ever so slightly modified version of a question from my book. My teacher went over this with me, but I would like an explanation that I can keep coming back to until I have this method figured out precisely. $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ $B = \{ n | n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, n^2 < 17 \}$ where $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is the positive integers. Show that $A = B$ I understand that to do this I must show for every $n$: $n \in B \rightarrow n \in A$ and $n \in A \rightarrow n \in B$ How to do that is still something I am not entirely sure how to do correctly, so I will give it my best and someone can show me errors or how to complete it. If, $n \in B$ then $n^2 < 17$ $n < \sqrt{25}$, therefore $n < 5$ Since $n$ is a positive integer, $0 < n$ therefore, for every $n \in B, 0 < n < 5$, therefore $n \in A$ For every element $n$ such that $n \in A$, $n$ is one of 1, 2, 3, or 4 (I am probably taking too long to do this, but I am unsure how thorough it needs to be, so I will stop here to not waste time. What I would like to know is how can I write this quicker but still make valid statements and show that A = B more easily? I am also making statements that seem unnecessary or unconventional and perhaps even invalid from a logical perspective. I appreciate any help you can offer, the more the merrier!) To finish the proof with help from amWhy: $4$ is the largest element of $A$, and $4 < \sqrt{17}$ Assuming $n \in A$, $0 < n \leq 4$, $n^2 \leq 16 < 17$, therefore, $\forall n(n \in A \rightarrow n \in B)$ Therefore $A = B$, hurray!","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Summation by parts, swapping the order of summation, and approximating $H_k$ by $\log k$ were my best ideas, but I could not get any of them to work.  (Perhaps someone else can?)  I would like a nice proof in order to complete my answer here . Bonus points for proving $A(1,2) = \frac{5}{8} \zeta(3)$ and $A(2,1) =  \zeta(3) - \frac{1}{2}\zeta(2) \log 2$, as those are the other two alternating Euler sums needed to complete my answer. Added : I'm going to change the accepted answer to robjohn's $A(1,1)$ calculation as a proxy for the three answers he gave here.  Notwithstanding the other great answers (especially the currently most-upvoted one, the one I first accepted), robjohn's approach is the one I was originally trying.  I am pleased to see that it can be used to do the $A(1,1)$, $A(1,2)$, and $A(2,1)$ derivations.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'harmonic-numbers', 'euler-sums', 'real-analysis']"

Show that $E$ is the support of a continuous positive Borel measure $\mu$. If $m(E)=0$, this gives examples of singular measures. I am wondering how to prove this. For a classical Cantor set or even fat Cantor set, I know how to construct the measure; for similar fractal shapes analgous methods are possible. However if we only know $E$ is closed and bounded, every point is a limit point of $E$, then I am at a loss how to prove this fact. Dimension is a barrier. Locally $E$ can be both ""continuous"" like closed cubes, or ""discrete"" like fat cantor sets. In the one dimensional case, constructing a sequence of continuous Borel measures via characteristic functions and taking the limit is usually suffice; in the general $\mathbb{R}^{k}$ case, I do not know what canonical choices I have, even though measure - function relationship still preserves.","['measure-theory', 'compactness', 'real-analysis']"
