1318552,Using second derivative to find a bound for the first derivative,"Let $f$ be a twice differentiable function on $\left[0,1\right]$ satisfying $f\left(0\right)=f\left(1\right)=0$. Additionally $\left|f''\left(x\right)\right|\leq1$ in $\left(0,1\right)$. Prove that $$\left|f'\left(x\right)\right|\le\frac{1}{2},\quad\forall x\in\left[0,1\right]$$ The hint we were given is to expand into a first order Taylor polynomial at the minimum of $f'$. So I tried doing that: As $f'$ is differentiable, it is continuous, and attains a minimum at $\left[0,1\right]$. Thus we can denote $x_{0}$ as the minimum, and expending into a Taylor polynomial of the first order around it gives us, for some $c$ between $x$ and $x_0$. $$T_{x_{0}}\left(x\right)=f\left(x_{0}\right)+f'\left(x_{0}\right)\left(x-x_{0}\right)+\frac{f''\left(c\right)}{2}\left(x-x_{0}\right)^{2}$$ Now at $x=0$ we have
$$T_{x_{0}}\left(0\right)=f\left(x_{0}\right)-x_{0}f'\left(x_{0}\right)+x_{0}^{2}\frac{f''\left(c\right)}{2}=0$$ And at $x=1$ we have $$T_{x_{0}}\left(0\right)=f\left(x_{0}\right)+\left(1-x_{0}\right)f'\left(x_{0}\right)+\left(1-x_{0}\right)^{2}\frac{f''\left(c\right)}{2}=0$$ and I'm pretty much stuck here.. So I tried a different approach using Mean Value Theorem directly, by Rolle's I know the derivative is $0$ somewhere (as $f(0)=f(1)$), suppose at $x_0$, so by mean value theorem $\frac{f'(x)}{x-x_0} =f''(c)\leq1$ for some $c$ and $f'(x)<x-x_0$. But using this approach as well I'm not sure how to proceed, as this gives me the desired propety only in $1/2$ environment around $x_0$... Any help?","['real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

$$
x_\star = (I_N - A^H(AA^H)^{-1}A)z,

where $I_N$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix. However, I'm having problems deriving this solution. I have tried to use the Lagrange multiplier method as follows. The dual optimization problem is
$$
\text{minimize}_{\{x,\lambda\}} \Vert z - x \Vert^2 + \lambda \Vert Ax \Vert^2,
$$
where $\lambda > 0$ is a Lagrange multiplier. Setting the derivative of the Lagrangian Dual with respect to $x$ to zero gives
$$
x_\star = (I_N - A^HA)^{-1}z,

$$
x_\star = (I_N - A^H(\tfrac{1}{\lambda}I_M + A A^H)^{-1}A)z.

Thus, the solution in the book and the solution I'm getting are equal when $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. What does this mean? Any ideas how can I get the $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ condition? Thank you very much for your help.","['optimization', 'linear-algebra']"

By checking the partial derivatives, I found that $P=[0,0,1]$ is a singular point. Checking the multiplicity of $P$ on $F$, I get $2$. Since the tangent lines aren't distinct and are $y=0$, an exceptional line, so $F$ is not in a good position and so I have to apply a change of coordinates  before using the standard Cremona transformation. Now, I did $T : x = X+Y, y=X-Y, z=Z$ as usual, which gives $$T(F) = 4x^2z^2+4y^2z^2 - 8xyz^2 - 8x^3y -8xy^3$$ that has (obviously) still got a double non ordinary point of multiplicity, but with $y=x$ as tangent (not an exceptional line). So now I should be able to apply Cremona and remove the non ordinary points.
But when I calculate $T(F) (yz,xz,xy)$ and I calculate the proper transform I get $$xy^3 + x^3 y-8x^2y^2-8y^2z^2-8x^2z^2$$
that still has a singularity at $P=[0,0,1]$ (and that's okay), but that has $x+iy$ and $x-iy$ as tangent lines there, so $P$ is now ordinary.

We say that the family of probability measures $\mu_\epsilon$, defined on $(X,B)$ and absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu $, satisfies the large deviation principle with the rate function $I$ if $$\limsup_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon \log \left ( \mu_\epsilon(F) \right ) \leq -\inf_{x \in F} I(x) \\
\liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon \log \left ( \mu_\epsilon(G) \right ) \geq -\inf_{x \in G} I(x)$$ whenever $F$ is closed and $G$ is open. (One can generalize somewhat, but I don't think it is necessary for this context.) I have seen examples that show that some ""natural"" situations where, if we allowed $F,G$ to be arbitrary measurable sets, we would not have an LDP, yet we ""should"" have one. For instance, if $\mu_\epsilon$ is the uniform distribution on $(-\epsilon,\epsilon)$, then the large deviation principle should tell us that $\mu_\epsilon$ ""collapses to $0$"", and the rate function should be $0$ at $0$ and $+\infty$ elsewhere. But if we drop the openness requirement in the lower bound, then we can take $G=\{ 0 \}$, in which case the inequality reads $-\infty \geq 0$, which is not true. I imagine there is a similar example if we drop the closedness requirement in the upper bound. So I understand logically that these topological constraints are necessary. But these counterexamples don't give me an intuition for why the topological constraints should be the way they are. With that in mind: why, intuitively, should the large deviation lower bound hold for open sets, and the upper bound for closed sets? For instance, is this a manifestation of the idea that open sets are ""large"" while closed sets are ""small""?","['probability-theory', 'large-deviation-theory', 'soft-question']"

1319003,Why this this approach to solving a trig equation yield invalid solutions alongside valid ones?,"I've got the following equation:
$$\csc(4x) - \cot(4x) = 1$$
$$0 < x < 2\pi$$ At first, I tried solving it like this:
$$\frac{1}{\sin(4x)} - \frac{\cos(4x)}{\sin(4x)} = 1$$
$$1 - \cos(4x) = \sin(4x)$$
$$1 = \sin(4x) + \cos(4x)$$
$$1^2 = \sin^2(4x) + \cos^2(4x) - 2\sin(4x)\cos(4x)$$
Then, because $\sin^2(4x) + \cos^2(4x) = 1$ and $2\sin(4x)\cos(4x) = \sin(8x)$:
$$\sin(8x) = 0$$
giving $$x = \frac{n\pi}{8} \text{, where n is an integer and } 1 \le n \le 15$$ 
However, plugging some of these answers back into the original trig function gives an undefined result, rather than 1. This happens with $x = \pi$, for example. The only valid solutions turn out to be as follows:
$$x = \frac{n\pi}{8} \text{, where } n = 1, 5, 9, 13 $$
I then realised how with some rearranging and the use of some trig identities, the original equation, $\csc(4x) - \cot(4x) = 1$ , could be expressed as:
$$\tan(2x) = 0$$

Prove the mapping $f:G\to G$ by $f(x) = x^2$ is injective For what it is worth this is what I have tried. Assume $x,y \in G$,  $f(x) = f(y)$. We want to show $x = y$. Case (i) Either $x$ or $y$ is $e$ (the identity element of $G$). Then w.l.o.g. let $x = e$. So $x^2 = y^2$.  $e^2 = e = y^2$.  So $y^{-1} = y$. So $y = e = x$ and we are done or the order of $y$ is $2$ which is a contradiction since $|G|$ is odd. Case (ii) Neither $x$ nor $y$ is $e$.  $x^2 = y^2$. Now I am out of gas.

The preceding theorem says that two unit speed curve defined on the same real line interval are congruent if their curvature and torsion are equal(torsion may differ by sign) So i would like to prove the collorary as follows: since the speeds of the two curves are the same, the arc length parametrizations are the same( with the same lower limit of integration), say t=t(s) So the unit speed parametrization of the two curves has the same curvature and torsion since the original curve has the same curvature and torsion and arc length paramerization. So the two unit speed parametrization of two curves are congruent. And substituting s=s(t), the original two curves are congruent. Is there any fallacy in my reasoning?

This is making me a bit uncomfortable: Question 2. In $R[x][y]$, it seems a bit odd to write $xy=yx$ (See Question 1) but we do certainly want to write this. I know these questions are rather vague.

Using the example here we see that $$\frac{a_{n}}{n} = \frac{n + 1}{n}\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \to e$$ I am thinking of some partial converse to the standard theorem above which can get us from limit of $a_{n}/n$ to limit of $a_{n} - a_{n - 1}$. Another option to prove $(1)$ is to make use of real variable theory. Thus we can put $x = 1/n$ and deal with function $f(x) = \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{x}\right)(1 + x)^{1/x}$ and use Taylor expansion $$(1 + x)^{1/x} = e - \frac{ex}{2} + \frac{11e}{24}x^{2} + \cdots$$ and $$g(x) = \left(\frac{1}{x} - 1\right)(1 - x)^{-1/x}$$ and calculate the limit of $f(x) - g(x)$ as $x \to 0$. This way we see that $$f(x) = \frac{e}{2} + \frac{e}{x} + o(1), g(x) = -\frac{e}{2} + \frac{e}{x} + o(1)$$ and clearly $f(x) - g(x) \to e$ as $x \to 0$.

To solve this problem one takes logarithms on the above relation and reduces the problem to the additive R-H problem $\operatorname{Log}\Phi^+(t)-\operatorname{Log}\Phi^-(t)=\operatorname{Log}G(t)$ which using the Plemelj formulae has the solution given by the Cauchy Integral 
$$\operatorname{Log}\Phi(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c} \frac{\operatorname{Log}G(t)}{t-z}\, dz.$$
But to use this formula the potential -here $\operatorname{Log}G(t)$- must satisfiy the Holder condition. The books that I have read about this justify this result using the fact that, since $\operatorname{Ind}_cG(t)=0$, the function $\operatorname{Log}G(t)$ is single-valued (which is true, no problem there) and thus Holder continuous.

1319844,Geometric Interpretation of Determinant of Transpose,"Below are two well-known statements regarding the determinant function: When $A$ is a square matrix, $\det(A)$ is the signed volume of the parallelepiped whose edges are columns of $A$. When $A$ is a square matrix, $\det(A) = \det(A^T)$. It appears to me that 1 is how $\det$ got invented in the first place. The multilinearity and alternating property are natural consequences. Cramer's rule can also be easily understood geometrically. However, 1 does not immediately yield 2. Of course the proof of 2 can be done algebraically, and it's not wrong to say that the algebra involved does come from 1. My question is, can 2 be viewed more geometrically? Can it feed us back a better geometric interpretation? [How would one visualize the row vectors of $A$ from the column vectors? And how would one think, geometrically, about the equality of the signed volume spanned by two visually different parallelepipeds?] Edit: If you are going to use multiplicativity of the determinant, please provide a geometric intuition to that too. Keep reading to see what I mean. Here is one of my failed attempts. I introduce a different interpretation: $\det(A)$ is the ratio of the volume of an arbitrary parallelepiped changed by applying $A^T$ (left multiplication), viewed as a linear transformation. The reason I say applying $A^T$ instead of applying $A$ is that I want the transpose to appear somewhere, and coincidentally the computation of $A^T u$ can be thought of geometrically in terms of columns of $A$: $A^T u$ is the vector whose components are dot products of columns of $A$ with $u$. (I'll take for granted the validity of the word arbitrary in 3 for the moment.) What is left to argue is the equality of 1 and 3, which I have not been able to do geometrically. Is This a Duplicate Question? In a sense yes, and in a sense no. I did participate in that question a long time ago. There was no satisfactory answer. The accepted answer does not say what a ""really geometric"" interpretation of (*) should be. Yes you can always do certain row and column operations to put a matrix into a diagonal form without affecting the determinant (with an exception of a possible sign flip), and by induction, one can prove $\det(A) = \det(A^T)$. This, however, seems to me more algebraic than geometric even though each step can be thought of as geometric. I am aware that the property of an interpretation being ""geometric"" or ""algebraic"" is not a rigorous notion and is quite subjective. Some may say that this is as far as ""geometry"" can assist us. I just want to know if that is really the case. That is why I tag this as a soft question. I also secretly hope that maybe one such interpretation would serve as a simple explanation of Cauchy-Binet formula.","['soft-question', 'determinant', 'exterior-algebra', 'geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

I've thought of an alternative: first we find the area under $f(x_i,y_j)$ where $i$ is a fixed value but $y_j$ goes from $c$  to $d$ using Simpson's Composite Rule and fill the coefficients in a vertical matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix}

Caveats One I can think of is that the bubble could move from 20.000001 to 15.000001 in one iteration. But I guess that is a small detail. Maybe this isn't even relevant. Edit: Here is the jsFiddle!

1319946,"Is $\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}$ widely studied, does it have an accepted name/notation, and where can I learn more about it?","Fix a positive integer $p$, possibly prime. For each natural number $n$, there is a ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together with a distinguished ring homomorphism $$\pi_n:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}.$$ For any given integer $k$, we can think of $\pi_n(k)$ as the remainder when $k$ is divided by $p^n$. Now clearly, $\pi_n$ will never be injective. If we wanted to get around this, we could trying bundling up all the $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together as a direct product. So define: $$\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z} = \prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$$ There is, of course, a unique ring homomorphism $\pi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}.$ In fact, it can be computed pointwise: $$(\pi(k))_{n} = \pi_n(k)$$ In some sense, we might say that $\pi(k)$ is the sequence of remainders obtained by attempting to divide $k$ by increasingly large powers of $p$. The cool thing about this is that: I'm pretty sure that $\pi$ is always injective; hence, we've included the integers in a bigger number system. Perhaps there are situations where we're working away in $\mathbb{Z}$ but we find that there aren't ""enough"" integers to do what we're trying to do; if so, one idea would be to look in $\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}$ for an appropriate choice of $p.$ Suppose $p$ is a prime number. Then to compute the number of copies of $p$ in the prime factorization of an integer $k$, we can simply count the number of $0$'s in the sequence $\pi(k)$. Furthermore, these $0$'s will always occur as an initial segment. Question. Is $\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}$ widely studied, is it associated with a standard name or notation, and where can I learn more about it?","['ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'number-theory', 'terminology', 'reference-request']"
1319952,"Definition of exponential function, single-valued or multi-valued?","If we define $$e^z=1+z+\frac{z^2}{2!}+\cdots$$ then it is single-valued. However, if we write $$e^z=e^{z\ln e}$$ then it is multi-valued. Besides, $a^z$ is multi-valued in general. It is kind of strange if only when the base is $e$ that it is single-valued. My thought:
Is it true that there are two exponential functions, let's call them $\exp(z)$ and $e^z$? Where $\exp(z)$ is defined by $$\exp(z)=1+z+\frac{z^2}{2!}+\cdots$$ and is single-valued, while $e^z$ is defined by $$e^z = \text{exp}(z\ln e)$$ and is multi-valued?

I need non-existence of periodic orbits. Which conditions $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ must satisfy? First, one can see that if $a\leq 0$, then the system has just one equilibrium point, (0,0). If $a>0$, then there are 3 equilibrium points (0,0), $(\pm a^{\frac{1}{2}}, 0)$. I tried to use a Lyapunov function of the form $V(x,y)=\pm ax^2 +y^2$ (depending on $a$) to limit (or not) an orbit, but it is really boring because there was a lot of possibilities to analyze. Is there any simpler way to look at this problem?","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1320060,Positive Elements of $\mathbb{C}G$: as functionals versus as elements of the C*-algebra,"I might have thought about this problem a little longer but am quite confused so said I would put this question to the good people here... Consider a finite group $G$ or rather the algebra of functions on $G$, $\mathbb{C}^G=F(G)$ with multiplication in $F(G)$ defined pointwise. We have an involution on $F(G)$: $$f^*(g)=\overline{f(g)}.$$ If we take the supremum norm on $F(G)$: $$\|f\|_\infty=\max_{g\in G}|f(g)|,$$ we have a C*-algebra. The positive elements of $F(G)$ are those of the form $f^*f$ and so those that have positive coefficients with respect to the basis $\{\delta_s:s\in G\}$ are the positive functions. Denote by $\mathbb{C}G$ the linear functionals on $F(G)$. This set is spanned by elements dual to the $\{\delta^s:s\in G\}$: $$\delta^s(\delta_t)=\delta_{t,s},$$
where the latter $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta. It is not difficult to show that the positive linear functionals of $\mathbb{C}(G)$ are those with positive coefficients with respect to the $\{\delta^s:s\in G\}$ basis. So for example, if $G=\{\mathbb{Z}_3,\,\oplus_3\}$ then $\displaystyle \nu=\frac{\delta^1+\delta^2}{2}\in\mathbb{C}G$ is a positive linear functional . However one can also give $\mathbb{C}G$ the structure of a C*-algebra. Extend by linearity the convolution product
$$(\delta^s,\delta^t)\mapsto \delta^{st};\qquad\delta^s\star\delta^t=\delta^{st},$$
to the whole of $\mathbb{C}G$. My understanding is that there are C*-norms on $\mathbb{C}G$ when equipped with the involution: $$\nu^*(\delta_s)=\overline{\nu(\delta_{s^{-1}})}.$$ Now positivity in this C*-algebra is not the same as positivity as a linear functional. In particular it is not difficult to show that there is no $\mu\in\mathbb{C}\mathbb{Z}_3$ such that $$\mu^*\star \mu=\frac{\delta^1+\delta^2}{2}=:\nu.$$ Therefore, as an element of the C*-algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\nu$ is not positive. Is there an easy way of recognising if an element of the C*- algebra $\mathbb{C}G$ is positive? Random thoughts... is it necessary for $\nu(\delta_e)\neq0$, symmetry plays a role? $\nu(\delta_s)=\nu(\delta_{s^{-1}})$... have we any positive elements of the algebra which are not positive functionals . Alternatively I need to look at self-adjoint --- $\nu(\delta_s)=\overline{\nu(\delta_{s^{-1}})}$ --- and positive spectrum... can I find the spectrum of an element of $\mathbb{C}G$?

(3 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I need to calculate $\lim \sin(2\pi n!e)$. I put it into Wolfram and saw that it is likely to converge to 0. Of course this would mean that the fractional part of $n!e$ should be always very close to either 0 or 0.5. It means that the fluctuation of the fractional part is gonna decrease. But how do I show that it will stop around 0 or 0.5? Cheers. EDIT: Solved. $n!e = k + \frac{n!}{(n+1)!}\left( \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)} + \ldots \right) < k + \frac{n!}{(n+1)!}\left ( 1 + \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3} + \ldots \right) = k + \frac{1}{n} $ where $k \in Z$ Therefore, the fractional part of $n!e$ approaches $0$.","['exponential-function', 'limits', 'real-analysis', 'trigonometry']"
1320166,Solution verification: when is the irreflexive closure of a relation defined?,"I am working on a problem that states the following: When is it possible to define the irreflexive closure of a relation $R$ , that is, a relation that contains $R$ , is irreflexive, and is contained in every irreflexive relation that contains $R$ ? Attempt: First note that a relation $R$ defined on a set $A$ is irreflexive if $(a,a) \notin R$ for all $a \in A$ . Suppose $R$ is a relation defined in a set $A$ . Let $S$ be an irreflexive relation on $A$ that contains $R$ . Then $(a,a)\notin S$ for all $a \in A$ and $R \subseteq S$ which implies that $(a,a) \notin R$ for all $a \in A$ . Therefore, $R$ is irreflexive on $A$ . Hence, unless $R$ is irreflexive, we can't define irreflexive closure of $R$ . Finally, note that when $R$ is irreflexive, the irreflexive closure of $R$ is $R$ itself. Question: is my approach correct?","['solution-verification', 'relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1320168,Natural and completed natural filtration not right-continuous,"I'm looking for an example of a stochastic process, such that the natural filtration and the completed natural filtration aren't right-continuous. I defined the process $(Z_t)_{t \geq 0}$ as $Z_t = t \cdot X$ where $X$ is a a.s. not constant random variable. For $t=0$ I get for the natural filtration $\mathcal{F}_0$: $\mathcal{F}_0 = \sigma(Z_0) = \sigma(0) = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$. For $t>0$ I get $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(Z_s, s \leq t) = \sigma(s \cdot X, s \leq t) = \sigma(X).$ (Is the last step correct, and if so, why exactly?) Now I get $\mathcal{F}^+_0 = \bigcap_{\epsilon >0} \mathcal{F}_{\epsilon} = \sigma(X) \neq \{\emptyset, \Omega\} = \mathcal{F}_0$. So the natural filtration isn't right-continuous. Now I add the null sets and have a look at the filtration $\hat{\mathcal{F}}_t = \sigma(\mathcal{F}_t \cup \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}})$.
Now I get $\hat{\mathcal{F}}_0 = \sigma(\{\emptyset,\Omega\} \cup \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}})$ and $\hat{\mathcal{F}}^+_0 = \bigcap_{\epsilon > 0} \sigma(\mathcal{F}_\epsilon \cup \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}}) = \bigcap_{\epsilon > 0} \sigma(\sigma(X) \cup \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}}) = \sigma(\sigma(X) \cup \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}})$. Since $X$ is a.s. not constant, $\sigma(X) \neq \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ and so I can find a $B \in \sigma(X), B \neq \Omega, B \neq \emptyset$ with $\mathbb{P}(B) \neq 0$ (Can I assume that and if so, why?). So $(B \cup N) \in \hat{\mathcal{F}}^+_0$ for $N \in \mathcal{N}_{\mathbb{P}}$, but $(B \cup N) \notin \hat{\mathcal{F}_0}$ and therefore the completed natural filtration is also not right-continuous. I have some doubts about my example and the proof; what do I have to change?
Or does someone has another and better example? Thanks a lot in advance.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"
