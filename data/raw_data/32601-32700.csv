309205,Sudokus as composition tables of finite groups,"If $G$ is a finite group then the composition table of $G$ is a latin square (ie, each row and column contains each group element exactly once). Assume now that $|G| = n^2$ for some natural number $n$. We can then split the composition table for $G$ into $n^2$ $n\times n$ squares, and we can ask whether the resulting table is a solved sudoku (of size $n^2\times n^2$ rather than the usual $9\times 9$). When making the composition table for $G$, there are two choices to be made. One is the ordering of the elements for the rows, and the other is an ordering of the elements for the columns. By looking at the row and column corresponding to the identity, one can see that if we pick the same ordering for rows and columns, then  the composition table cannot be a sudoku (if we label the entries in the composition table as $a_{i,j}$ and the row/column corresponding to the identity is $k$ then we have $a_{k-1,k} = a_{k,k-1}$ and $a_{k+1,k} = a_{k,k+1}$ and at least one of these pairs belong to the same $n\times n$ square). If $G$ is cyclic, then we can indeed make the composition table a sudoku as follows: Write $G = \{0,1,\dots ,n^2 - 1\}$ (identified with the integers mod $n^2$). Order the columns in the natural way (ie, in increasing order with the chosen representatives), and order the rows in blocks of $n$ such that in each block, the difference between consecutive terms is $n$ (so each block consists of those elements with a given residue mod $n$ in increasing order). For the non-cyclic group of order $4$, it is also possible (it is easy to do by trial and error). For the non-cyclic group of order $9$, it is again possible, but it takes a while to find some orderings that work. Ones that work are as follows: Let the group be generated by two elements $a$ and $b$ and order the columns as $1,ab,a^2b^2,a,b^2,a^2b,a^2,ab^2,b$ and the rows as $1,a,b,ab,a^2,b^2,a^2b,ab^2,a^2b^2$. My question is: For what groups is it possible to find orderings of the rows and columns that turn the composition table into a sudoku? Edit: Note that if this is possible for some group $G$ then each of those $n\times n$ squares correspond to a pair of subsets $A,B\subseteq G$, each of size $n$, such that $AB = G$. In fact, it is possible iff there are subsets $A_i$ and $B_i$ of $G$ all of size $n$ such that $$G = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i = \bigcup_{i=1}^n B_i$$ and such that for all $i,j$ we have $A_iB_j = G$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'sudoku']"

For (ii), by Martingale Convergence Theorem, we can show that $X_n$ converges to almost surely to some $X$ with $\mathbb{E}X \le \mathbb{E}X_0 = 1.$ ($X_0$ is not explicitly defined in the question, but to make $X_n$ a martingale, we need $X_0 = 1$.)

At the beginning, I put it equals to $0$ as an obvious thing, but strangely enough, ""Mathematica"" gives me something strange: $e^{2i\operatorname{Interval}[0,\pi]}$, then I thought maybe I was wrong with ""obviousity"" of the result, because we can actually put (formally) $0=e^{-\infty+i\phi}$, then if we use $a^b=e^{b\log a}$ we have $0^i=e^{-i\infty-\phi}$ (where all $2\pi k$ included in the infinity or $\phi$).

309313,Second-countable implies separable/Axiom countable choice,"Let $(X,\mathscr T)$ be a topological space, and $(B_n)_{n\ge1}$ a
  countable basis for X. Under this assumptions, X is separable. The proof of this assertion is as follows: We can assume without loss of generality that all the $B_n$ are nonempty, because the empty ones can be discarded. Now, for each $B_n$, pick any element $x_n \in B_n$. Let $D$ be the set of these $x_n$. $D$ is clearly countable. We claim that $D$ is dense in $X$. To see this, let $U$ be any nonempty open subset of $X$. Then, $U$ contains some $B_n$, and hence, $x_n \in U$. But by construction, $x_n \in D$, so $D$ intersects $U$, proving that $D$ is dense. $\blacksquare$ My question is, can this theorem be proven without the axiom of countable choice?","['separable-spaces', 'general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'second-countable', 'axiom-of-choice']"
309318,How to determine the degrees of freedom of an inner-product matrix of two random matrices?,"I have two random matrices $A$ and $B$, with $N$ columns each. The columns of $A$ and $B$ are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. $A$ and $B$ may be considered as two instances of an underlying matrix, for example, they may represent two sets of data-driven basis functions learned from datasets of subjects $A$ and $B$. With this setup, it follows that $M < N$ columns of $A$ have corresponding columns in $B$. That is, the inner product $A_i \cdot B_j$ of columns $A_i$ and $B_j$ is close to $1$ for $M < N$ pairs $(i,j)$, where $M$ is unknown a priori. The above intuition suggests that all entries of the matrix $G$, where $G_{i,j} = A_i \cdot B_j$ , are not independent of each other. My question: if one were to model $A$ and $B$ as random orthogonal matrices, how many degrees of freedom would $G$ have? How does one go about addressing this problem? Analytically? By simulation?

computing $ x \left(1-\dfrac{2}{3}\right)\left(1-\dfrac{2}{5}\right)...\left(1-\dfrac{2}{p_i}\right)$. However here it appears not naive and it actually works pretty well.

309619,About translating subsets of $\Bbb R^2.$,"I'm looking for a pair of sets $A,B$ of points in $\Bbb R^2$ such that $A$ is a union of translated (only translations are allowed) copies of $B;$ $B$ is a union of translated copies of $A;$ $A$ is not a a single translated copy of $B$ (and the other way around, which follows). The unions are arbitrary, even uncountable, and they need not be disjoint. I can't even decide whether I believe such $A,B$ should exist or not. Could you help me please? I've looked at many different sets, and I suspect that if such sets exist, then $A$ and $B$ need to be rather strange, but I can prove nothing interesting other than that $A$ and $B$ cannot be finite. It seems unlikely to me that there could be examples of positive finite measure, but I can't prove it. I've tried with many zero-measure and infinite-measure sets, but I really have no clue. (I should note that if such sets exist but are non-measurable, I'm interested in them too.) Sorry if the tags are wrong, but I'm just not sure which ones to use. Added. I think defining $A$ and $B$ recursively could work. If I take two sets of vectors $X$ and $Y$, then a set $A_0$, and then define $B_n=A_{n-1}+X,$  $A_n=B_n+Y$ for $n>0$, then $$\left(\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n\right)+X=\bigcup_{n\geq0}(A_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$$ and also $$\left(\bigcup_{n>0}B_n\right)+Y=\bigcup_{n>0}(B_n+X)=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n.$$ So if $\displaystyle\bigcup_{n\geq0}A_n=\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ or, equivalently, $\displaystyle A_0\subseteq\bigcup_{n>0}A_n,$ then the sets $A=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}A_n$ and $B=\displaystyle\bigcup_{n>0}B_n$ are unions of translated copies of each other. One obvious way to achieve that is to have an $x\in X$ such that $-x\in Y.$ Then $$A_0=A_0+x-x\subseteq A_0+X+Y=A_1.$$ But then also $$A+x\subseteq A+X=B$$ and $$B-x\subseteq B+Y=A,$$ whence $B\subseteq A+x$ and so $A+x=B.$ So this doesn't work. I think that it could be a good idea to make the ""comeback to $A_0$"" take infinitely many steps, so the vectors that are used to ""come back"" don't add up to any single vector. Unfortunately this is rather vague. I will think about it, but if you have any ideas on this specifically, please do share.","['geometry', 'set-theory', 'group-theory', 'additive-combinatorics']"

309649,Proving existence of limit by Martingale.,"I'm thinking about a question: Suppose $y_n > −1$ for all $n$ and $\sum |y_n| < \infty$. Show that $\prod_{m=1}^\infty (1 + y_m)$ exists. Since $\sum |y_n| < \infty$, we must be able to find a constant $M = \sup(1 + y_n)$ with $M < \infty$. Let $X_0 = 1$ and $X_n = \prod_{m=1}^n (1 + y_m) /M^n$. $X_n$ forms a super martingale. It follows from martingale convergence theorem that $X_n \to c$ almost surely, where $c$ is a constant with $0 \le c \le \mathbb E[X_0] = 1$. Since the limit of $M^n c$ exists, we must have the limit of $\prod_{m=1}^\infty (1 + y_m)$ also exists. Is this a correct proof? OK, I think this might not have much to do with martingale. Now second try. It suffices to show that $\sum_{m=1}^\infty |\log(1+y_m)|$ converges. By Taylor's theorem, we have
$$
\log(1+y_m) = \frac 1 {a_m} y_m,
$$
where $a_m$ is a number between $1$ and $1 + y_m$. Since $\sum_m |y_m| < \infty$, we have $y_m \to 0$. So for any $L > 1$, we can find $M$ such that for all $m \ge M$, $|1/a_m| \le L$. Therefore, we have
$$
\sum_{m \ge M} |log(1+y_m)| \le M \sum_{m \ge M} |y_m| < \infty.
$$
Since dropping finite terms at the beginning of a series does not change weather it converges, we have $\sum_{m=1}^\infty |\log(1+y_m)|$ converges.","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"

309914,Integration of hyperreal functions / Intermediate Value Theorem,"Here's a statement on hyperreal function I've been trying to prove (I came up with it but I think it is true): Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous real-valued function and $h(x)$ is a continuous hyperreal-valued function such that $f(x) \approx h(x)$ for all $x$ (even infinite). If $\int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx$ and $\int_a^\infty h(x)\,dx$ exist and are finite, then $ \int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx = \int_a^\infty h(x)\,dx$ . Note: $\int_a^\infty g(x)\,dx = st\left(\sum_a^Ng(x)\,dx\right)$ for any infinite $N$ . Using notions of standard analysis, I can show that $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx - \int_a^b h(x)\,dx=0$ for all real $b$ and therefore remains $0$ as $b$ grows. However, I am unable to use nonstandard analysis on this, that is, to show $\sum_a^N f(x)\,dx \approx \sum_a^N h(x)\,dx$ for all positive infinite $N$ . Just because the statement holds for all real $b$ , I can't see why it must hold for infinite hyperreals and so I feel like my proof is not rigorous enough. The transfer principle will not apply since $h(x)$ does not have to be a natural extension of any real-valued function. Even more, the statement implies that if $h(x) \approx 0$ and $\sum_0^N h(x)\,dx \approx \sum_0^{M} h(x)\,dx \approx  r \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $N,M$ , then $r= 0$ . So we can't have a sort of infinite series of infinitesimals that equals $1$ . This seems surprising to me. Edit: Would it be valid to argue that $$\delta(b) = st\left(\sum_a^b f(x)\,dx - \sum_a^b h(x)\,dx\right) = \begin{cases} 0, & b \text{ is finite} \\ r \neq 0, &b \text{ is infinite} \end{cases}$$ is impossible since $\delta(b)$ is a continuous function? $\delta(b)$ is constant for infinite $b$ because the integrals exist and are finite and thus $\delta(N)=\delta(M)$ for any infinite $N, M$ . Edit 2: Justification of this approach has brought me to another problem altogether. The function $l(x)=st(x)$ is defined on all finite hyperreals and continuous but does not satisfy the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) in ${}^*\mathbb{R}$ . For example, $l(0)=0$ and $l(1)=1$ but there is no $x \in [0,1]$ such that $l(x)=\epsilon$ for any infinitesimal $\epsilon$ . However, there is an $x$ such that $l(x) \approx \epsilon$ . In this second sense, $l(x)$ passes the IVT but $\delta(b)$ does not. I still need to work out the details to understand why I had to reword the theorem for hyperreal-valued functions. Edit 3: I think I've finally resolved the matter. I tried to see if the hyperreal number line is complete, and as I suspected, the nonstandard metric is defined in terms of $\approx$ or ""halos."" So instead of points converging, it is the halos that do. That is why I had to reword the Intermediate Value Theorem to use $\approx$ instead of $=$ . So yes, $\delta(b)$ can only be continuous if it is $0$ everywhere.","['improper-integrals', 'nonstandard-analysis', 'analysis']"

I can think of three different ways to extend the sides of all the inner rectangles indefinitely, and I still can't figure out which one they mean because the picture is pretty strange, and so now I figure I am wrong about why the authors feel the need to prove such an obvious statement. The next sentence is ""This construction yields finitely many rectangles...and a partition of the integers between 1 and M"".  I'm sorry, but is this a joke, or is this just a weak part of the book that I should skip over? By the end of the proof I am left very confused as to what the point of this section is.  Can someone please explain what I am missing here? Thanks!",['real-analysis']

309986,A possible vacuous logical implication in Topology,"While reading ""Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis"" by G.F Simmons, in the chapter on Topological Spaces, I came across the following statement that seemed unusual. I feel it may be a vacuous truth but I don't know why. The statement is the following ad verbatim: Let $X$ be a non-empty set. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary class of subsets of $X$. If $\mathcal{S}$ is empty, then the class of all finite intersections of it's sets is the single element class $\{X\}$ and the class of all unions of sets in this class is $\{\varnothing,X\}$. I do not follow this argument. So I would appreciate it if someone could throw some light onto this issue. If it is a vacuous truth, I would like to see how.

310026,On Ramanujan's Question 359,"In JIMS 4, p.78, Question 359 was asked by Ramanujan. (See The Problems Submitted by Ramanujan to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society , p. 9, by Bruce Berndt, et al.) If, $$\sin(x+y) = 2\sin\big(\tfrac{1}{2}(x-y)\big)\tag1$$ $$\sin(y+z) = 2\sin\big(\tfrac{1}{2}(y-z)\big)\tag2$$ prove that, $$\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\sin x\cos z\big)^{1/4}+\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\cos x\sin z\big)^{1/4} =\big(\sin 2y)^{1/12}\tag3$$ The example by Ramanujan was, $$\begin{aligned}
x &= \frac{\pi-\arcsin\big((\sqrt{5}-2)^3(4+\sqrt{15})^2\big)}{2}=1.094\dots\\ 
y &=\frac{\arcsin\big(\sqrt{5}-2\big)}{2}=0.119\dots\\
z &=\frac{\arcsin\big((\sqrt{5}-2)^3(4-\sqrt{15})^2\big)}{2}=0.0001\dots
\end{aligned}$$ Ten years later, a 3-page proof was given in JIMS 15, p.114-117. I got an email asking if there was a shorter proof. Considering the problem, I observed the following. Given the quartic, $$a^3w^4+(1-3a^2)w^3+3a(1-a^2)w^2+a^2(3-a^2)w-a=0\tag4$$
with $a=\tan(\color{blue}y/4)$. Define,
$$x=4\tan^{-1} u\\z=4\tan^{-1} v$$ 
where $u,v$ are two appropriate roots of the quartic, then we get the same bizarre relation as Ramanujan, $$\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\sin x\cos z\big)^{1/4}+\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\cos x\sin z\big)^{1/4} =\big(\sin 2\color{blue}y)^{1/12}\tag5$$ Equivalently, those two roots $u,v$ obey, $$\left(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{4(u-u^3)}{(u^2+1)^2}\frac{v^4-6v^2+1}{(v^2+1)^2} \right)^{1/4}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{4(v-v^3)}{(v^2+1)^2}\frac{u^4-6u^2+1}{(u^2+1)^2} \right)^{1/4}=\big(\sin 2\color{blue}y\big)^{1/12}\tag6$$ For example, let $y=1$, so $a=\tan(1/4)$, then $u,v$ are the two real roots of (4).

310044,"If $f_n(x)=x^n$ converges to $f$, why is $f$ not continuous?","I was reading my Analysis course notes and had some trouble. I hope you can help me. Let $C(X)=\{ f | f:X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ is a continuous function}\}$. It was already stated and proved in the notes that, whenever $X$ is a compact metric space, then $C(X)$ is a complete metric space regarding the uniform metric $d_\infty(f,g)= \displaystyle \sup_{x \in X} \lvert f(x)-g(x) \rvert$. What I thought: if $C(X)$ is complete, then every Cauchy sequence of functions $f_n$ in $C(X)$ must converge to a function $f \in C(X)$. But then it came to me that the sequence $f_n(x)=x^n$ is such that $f_n \in C([0,1])$ for all  $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but $f_n$ converges to $f \in l^\infty(X)$, where
$$ f(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    0, \text{ if } x \in [0,1)\\
    1, \text{ if } x = 1

$$
and $l^\infty(X)$ is the metric space of all the limited real functions defined in $X$ with the metric above. If $f_n \longrightarrow f \in l^\infty(X)$, then $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $C(X)$. As $C(X)$ is complete, why is it that $f \notin C(X) \subset l^\infty(X)$? I'm sure my mistake is as silly as a wrong assumption, but I can't spot where it is. Could someone give me a clue?

Consider some (divergent) series $S = K + a + b + c + d + \dots $ . To assign a finite sum to it I'm trying to use the matrix of the Eulerian numbers (let's call it Eulermatrix for now) to do something in the spirit of Abel- or possibly(?) Borel-summation: I define the function $$f(x) = K + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \dots $$ with the goal to arrive at a valid/meaningful result for the case that $x \to 1$ . The use of the Eulermatrix (see end of the post) implies then the introduction of a transform of $f(x)$ in the form $$ g(x) = K + ax + bx^2/2! + cx^3/3! + dx^4/4! + \dots  $$ If I now evaluate the sequence of partial sums according to the decomposition of the Eulerian numbers in combination with the reciprocal factorials I arrive at the form $$ s_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k ((n-k)x) ^k {g^{(k)}((n-k)x) \over k!} \qquad n=1 \dots \infty \tag1$$ and if this converges to a finite value then I assume this as the (divergent) sum of the series and assume $$S = \lim _{n \to \infty} s_n(1)$$ I get meaningful results for series which have growth rates like geometric series with $q \lt 1$ and I think that the formalism of conversion into a double-sum and changing order of evaluation using the Eulermatrix gives also the range for $q$ as $- \infty \lt q \lt 1$ (because the $g(x)$ function is then entire). I can even evaluate the classical series $0! - 1! + 2! - 3! + \ldots - $ to which already L. Euler assigned the value of about $0.596...$ which is now called Gompertz constant . So I'm confident, that my general reasoning using the Eulermatrix is valid. But now: what I'm asking here is about the expression for $s_n(x)$ which reminds me of the Maclaurin-expression (which expresses a function by its derivatives at zero), but which I've not seen yet.

\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}+\phi(s)

with an holomorphic $\phi$ for any $s\in\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathfrak{Re}(s)>0$. I understand the proof except for one detail: $\phi$ is given explicitly by $\phi=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \phi_n$ with
\begin{align*}
\phi_n(s)=\int_n^{n+1} \left(n^{-s}-t^{-s}\right) dt.

My question is: How exactly does this follow? I noted the following statements for $s=x+iy$ where $x=\mathfrak{Re}(s)$ and $y=\mathfrak{Im}(s)$ and $f(t)=n^{-s}-t^{-s}$ Because $|t^{iy}|=|e^{iy\ln(t)}|=1$ (since it is on the unit circle) and $|t^{x+1}|=t^{x+1}$ (since $t$ and $x$ are real) we see that
\begin{align*}
\left|f'(t)\right|=\left|\frac{s}{t^{x+1+iy}}\right|=\frac{|s|}{|t^{x+1}| |t^{iy}|}=\frac{|s|}{t^{x+1}}
\end{align*} Because $f(n)=0$ we can calculate
\begin{align*}
|f(n+1)|=|f(n+1)-f(n)|=\left|\int_n^{n+1}f'(t)dt\right|\leq\sup_{n\leq t\leq n+1}\left|f'(t)\right|=\sup_{n\leq t\leq n+1}\frac{|s|}{t^{x+1}}=\frac{|s|}{n^{x+1}}

My question can be then reformulated: can we construct an infinite R-path (on any set)? My intuition is no, because at the path-point we got to after n steps, let's call it (N, M), the next path-point is either (M, not-the-end-point) or (M, end-point). The second option can't be right because we only traversed n path-points (and the path is infinite); but if first option is always right (that is, if the next step doesn't get us to the end), then there is no next-to-the-last path-point. This is probably useless since it only shows it is impossible to traverse (going one-by-one) such path (which was obvious from beginning), not that such path is impossible, but it might have to do with the actual annswer...

310241,The algebraic de Rham complex,"Let $A$ be a commutative $R$-algebra (or more generally a morphism of ringed spaces).

The construction is given as an exercise in Lang's Algebra (XIX, Theorem 3.2). Somehow this is not completely formal since $\Omega^i_{A/R}$ only has a universal property as an $A$-module, not as an $R$-module, right? We depand that $d^{p+q}(\omega \wedge \eta) = d^p(\omega) \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \omega \wedge d^q(\eta)$ for $\omega \in \Omega^p, \eta \in \Omega^q$. This implies $d^1(a * d^0(b)) = d^0(a) \wedge d^0(b)$, and more generally $d^1$ maps $\sum_i a_i * d^0(b_i) \mapsto \sum_i d^0(a_i) \wedge d^0(b_i)$. Conversely, one could try to define $d^1$ this way. But then it is not clear to me how to show well-definedness. I will sketch what I have done to remedy this, but probably it's way too complicated, and I wonder if there is a more direct approach. There is an isomorphism $\Omega^1_{A/R} \to I/I^2$ mapping $a * d(b) \mapsto [ab \otimes 1-a \otimes b]$, where $I$ is the kernel of the multiplication map $A \otimes_R A \to A$. It fits into a long exact sequence $\dotsc A^{\otimes {n+1}} \to A^{\otimes n} \to \dotsc$ where the differentials are alternating sums, for example $A^{\otimes 4} \to A^{\otimes 3}$ maps $a \otimes b \otimes c \otimes d$ to $ab \otimes c \otimes d - a \otimes bc \otimes d + a \otimes b \otimes cd$. Exactness implies that $I$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of this differential. Now define $A^{\otimes 3} \to \Omega^2_{A/R}$ by $a \otimes b \otimes c \mapsto d^0(ac) \wedge d^0(b)$. This is a well-defined $R$-linear map. One checks that it vanishes on the image of $A^{\otimes 4} \to A^{\otimes 3}$, hence extends to $I$. One then checks that it also vanishes on $I^2$, so that it extends to $I/I^2 \cong \Omega^1_{A/R}$. The resulting map $d^1$ has the desired description. Once one has $d^1$, one might define the other differentials inductively by $d^{p+1}(\omega \wedge \eta) = d^p(\omega) \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \omega \wedge d^1(\eta)$. But then again well-definedness seems to be not so clear. Of course there are no such problems when $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is a vector bundle over $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, which also explains that they don't occur for the de Rham complex on a smooth manifold.","['commutative-algebra', 'differential-forms', 'algebraic-geometry']"
310247,I need to trace the edge of a hexagon point by point,"To create an animation in code I first need to be able to describe a point by point path around a hexagonal shape. I already have the $\displaystyle \frac{x}{y}$ coordinate of each vertex. I don't know which direction I will be travelling around the edge so any solution should be able to work in either direction. The radius, and therefore each side, of the hexagon is 20 pixels. I need to produce a set of $20$ points for each side that maps the $x$ and $y$ position of each point in that path. This is obviously easy for straight lines where each point increments $1$ for each step and the other axis remains static. With the angled sides I am failing get the trigonometry required to plot the points. I'm fairly positive this is trivial but would appreciate some help getting clear in my mind.","['trigonometry', 'geometry']"
310260,Show that a straight line has a lebesgue measure of zero,"Prove that under Lebesgue Measure on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ every straight line has a measure of zero. My try: Let A = $\{ (x,f(x)), x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ be the set of all points lying on the straight line $y = f(x)$. Show that $\lambda(A) = 0$. Let $\{ (a_{i}, b_{i})\}$ be a sequence covering $\mathbb{R}$ with $ b_{i} - a_{i} = 1$ $ \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Define $K_{i} = \{ (x,f(x) - \frac{\epsilon}{2^{i}})\times (x,f(x) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^{i}}), x \in (a_{i}, b_{i}) \} $ Then K = $ \cup_i K_{i}$ covers A and $\lambda(K) \leq \sum_{i}(b_{i} - a_{i}) \frac{2\epsilon}{2^{i}} = 2\epsilon \rightarrow 0, \epsilon \rightarrow 0$. Since $K$ covers $A$, $\lambda(A) \leq \lambda(K)$ Is this ok or I have I missed something or done something wrong?",['measure-theory']
