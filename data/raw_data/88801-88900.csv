1185832,Name of the matrix transform $AA^*$ given A?,"There are a number of places this matrix transform making its appearance: Every positive semi-definite matrix $B$ can have a decomposition $B=AA^*$ If the matrix $A$ is a lower triangular matrix then $B=AA^*$ is also called as Cholesky decomposition of $B$ Given a system of linear equations: $Ax=b$, $(A^*A)x = (A^*b)$ represents ""normal equations"" If X is a random vector, $\mathbb{E}[XX^*]$ is called its covariance matrix Poalr decomposition problem : A = UP ( U nitary and P ositive semi-definite) is solved by $P=\sqrt{A^*A}$

1185846,"Torsion and curvature of the curve $X(t) = (at, bt^2, ct^3)$","Hey all I am looking for help on a problem. I will post it, and than I will add what I have tried and my ideas etc.  The question has been up now for a few days, I'm sure someone out there can help! I even put a bounty, I have spent a lot of time on this question! I am interested in calculating the torsion ($\tau$) and curvature ($\kappa$) of the curve $$X(t)=(at,bt^2,ct^3), \quad t   \ge   0 $$ and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive constants. So here is what I am having problems with. It seems like there are so many different formulas for curvature, and there are also the Frenet–Serret formulas so I am having issues deciding how to do it. I was thinking maybe I could reparametrize with respect to arc length, which would give me it in terms of unit length so I could use some of Frenet–Serret formulas, but I am not confident in that. What I did so far was I calculated $X'(t)=(a,2bt,3ct^2)$ and $|X'(t)|=\sqrt{a^2+4b^2 t^2 +9c^2 t^4}$. Then I  calculated $$X''(t)=(0, 2b, 6ct)$$ and $$|X''(t)|=2\sqrt{b^{2}+9c^{2}t^{2}}.$$ I also know that the unit tangent, $$T(t)={X'(t)\over|X'(t)|}$$ and the unit normal is $$N(t)={T'(t) \over |T'(t)|}$$ and that the binormal is $B= T \times N$. But I am really not sure how to take it further. I know that in arc length parametrzation we would have $dT/ds= \kappa N$ and $dN/ds=-\kappa T + \tau B$ and $dB/ds= -\tau N$. Should I keep it in the form it is and use the equation $$\kappa={|X'(t) \times X''(t)|\over |X'(t)|^3}?$$ A few of the other things I am thinking of is that maybe I could solve for torsion by the following: I know that $T$, $B$ and $N$ form an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb R^{3}$ so can and when we write $N'=\alpha T + \tau B$ , is the coefficient, $\tau$  the definition of torsion? Moreover, noting $B= T \times N$, we have $$B'= T'\times N + T \times N' = T \times N' =T \times (\alpha T+\tau B) = \tau T \times B= -\tau N $$  (because $N=B \times T$ so $T \times B=-N)$. I think this is how I understand the derivation for that equation. Is it only in arc length parametrization that I can use the Frenet equations for example? However, I think I should be able to do it just using the regular formulas, and not an arc length parametrization as the integral would be tough. I did conform this as well, so in terms of the basics of this question I'd like to do it without arc length parametrization. I am also interested in seeing a intuitive derivation of the torsion formula (the one with the triple product). I apologize if I didn't show enough work, this is all I could do but I am very happy to learn it. Thanks a lot to any help! UPDATE: I am wondering about the validity of what I now have. In addition to above I computed $X'''(t)=(0,0,6c)$ $X' \times X''= (6bct^2,-6act,2ab)$ $(X' \times X'') \cdot X''' = (12abc)$ $|X' \times X''| = 2 \sqrt {9b^2c^2t^4+9a^2c^2t^2+a^2b^2}$. Now can I just apply the formulas $$\tau = \frac{ (X' \times X'') \cdot X'''}{|X' \times X''|^2}.$$","['curves', 'parametric', 'calculus']"
1185872,Probability proof of inversion formula for Laplace transform,"Let $f:[0, \infty[\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be  bounded and continuous and define $L(\lambda)=\int_0^\infty e^{-\lambda x}f(x)dx$. Let $X_n$ be a sequence of independent random variables with exponential distribution of rate $\lambda$.
Using the fact that the sum $S_n=X_1+...+X_n$ has Gamma distribution we can see that
$$  (-1)^{n-1}\frac{\lambda^nL^{(n-1)}(\lambda)}{(n-1)!} =Ef(S_n)$$

How can we use this to 
prove $$ f(y)=\lim_{n}(-1)^{n-1}\frac{(\frac{n}{y})^nL^{(n-1)}(\frac{n}{y})}{(n-1)!} $$ We know that by the strong law of large numbers $S_n/n$ converges to $E(X_1)$ almost everywhere, so I could consider

1185921,Negative modulus,"In the programming world, modulo operations involving negative numbers give different results in different programming languages and this seems to be the only thing that Wikipedia mentions in any of its articles relating to negative numbers and modular arithmetic. It is fairly clear that from a number theory perspective $-13 \equiv 2 \mod 5$. This is because a modulus of $5$ is defined as the set $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and having $-13 \equiv -3 \mod 5$ would contradict that because $-3 \not\in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$. My question is then regarding a negative modulus. What definition of a modulus of $-5$ would make the most sense in number theory?

There is an action of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ on $X(N)$ and $Y(N)$, given by $M \cdot (E,\phi)=(E,M\phi)$. In this paper http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bubaran/classlast.pdf , the author lets $H$  be a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$, and defines a modular curve $X_H(N)$ to be $X(N)$ quotiented out by the action of $H$.

When it comes to finite group schemes, every author I have read so far restricts himself to the case of schemes which are also flat over the base, sometimes with the remark that it does not make much sense to consider a finite group scheme which is not flat. On the other hand the base scheme is usually assumed at least locally noetherian and in this case finite flat and locally free of finite rank are equivalent. I have thus two questions: Why does it not make sense to consider a finite group scheme that is not flat? Why do we assume the scheme to be flat and not only to be locally free of finite rank over the base? Why do we need the noetherian hypothesis on the base scheme? Could we not just consider schemes that are locally free of finite rank over an arbitrary base?

1186271,"Isothermal parameterization, Inverse of the Gauss Map","This problem is from Do Carmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. It is question 13 from chapter 3.5, to be specific. Suppose that S is a minimal surface without any umbilical points (that is to say that $k_1 = -k_2$ everywhere). Let $\bar{x}$ be a parameterization of the unit sphere by stereograhic projection, and consider a neighborhood $V$ of a point $p$ on the surface so that the Gauss map $N: S \rightarrow S^2$ restricted to the neighborhood $V$ is a diffeomorphism. The question is to show that the parameterization $q= N^{-1}$ o $\bar x$ is isothermal, meaning that $<q_u, q_u > = <q_v, q_v>$ and $<q_u,q_v> = 0$ everywhere on $S$. Now when I saw this question, my first instinct was to try to verify that $q$ was isothermal directly by computing the parameterization in some kind of coordinates directly. I know that stereographic projection is given by the formulas: $$ x= \frac {4u}{u^2+v^2+4}$$ $$ y = \frac {4v}{u^2+v^2+4}$$ $$ z = \frac {2(u^2+v^2)}{u^2+v^2+4} $$ I figured with this information, maybe I could find a way to write down what $q$ is in terms of $u$ and $v$ and take partials. The problem is that I don't know how to write down anything about $N^{-1}$. Like when working with $N$, I can say that a point on a surface $S$ goes to it's normal, which is something that I can compute in terms of cross products of partial derivatives of a parameterization of the surface.

1186323,Prove that for each $p \in Y$ the quotient field of $O_p$ is isomorphic to the field $K(Y)$.,"I'm reading Algebraic Geometry of Hartshorne. I have a question about a proof. First of all I'll write the important definitions that Hartshorne uses. Let $Y\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ be a quasi-affine variety. A function $f:Y\to \mathbb{k}$ is said to be regular at $P\in Y$ if is an open neighborhood $U$ of $P$ such that $U\subset Y$ and polynomials $g,h\in A=\mathbb{k}[x_1,...,x_n]$ such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f=g/h$ on $U$. We say that $f$ is regular at $Y$ if is regular at each $P\in Y$. We denote by $O(Y)$ the ring of all regular functions on $Y$. If $P\in Y$, we define the local ring of $P$ on $Y$, $O_P$ to be the ring of germs of regular functions on $Y$ near $P$. In other words, an element of $O_P$ is a pair $\left<U,f\right>$ where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $P$ and $f$ is regular on $U$. And where we identify two pairs $\left<U,f \right>$ and $\left<V,g \right>$ if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$. Finally we define the function field $K(Y)$ as the set of equivalence relations, given by elements of the form $\left<U,f \right>$ for some $U$ open subset of $Y$ (not necessary containing $P$). The operations that turns $O_p$ and $K(Y)$ into a rings an actually $K(Y)$ into a field are the usual for germs. I'm reading the proof of Theorem $3.2$, I don't understand the proof of part $d)$. It uses the following observation: My question: Prove that for each $p \in Y$ the quotient field of $O_p$ is isomorphic to the field $K(Y)$. An element $z \in Frac(O_P)$ is writen in the form $z=f/g$ where $f,g\in O_P$ and $g$ is not the zero on $O_P$. Recall that $f,g$ are equivalence classes of the form $\left<U,f \right>$ and $\left<V,g \right>$,  without lost of generality we can assume that $U=V$ otherwise we intersect the open sets and restrict the functions. I think that the most natural map is given by $\phi: Frac(O_p) \to K(Y)$ defined by: $$ \left<U,f \right> / \left<U,g \right> \mapsto  \left<U,f/g \right>$$ I proved that $\phi$ is an injective ring homomorphism.

I have much harder metrics to prove but I would like to try to understand this simpler space before I move onto more difficult ones.

Hence any concrete lattice $-$ i.e. a lattice of sets taken under union and intersection $-$ satisfies the infinite distributive law if it is closed under arbitrary unions. In Peter T. Johnstone's Stone Spaces , Exercise 2.5 is to prove every distributive lattice $L$ is isomorphic to a concrete lattice $\Phi$. In this case we identify each $x \in L$ with the set of all morphisms $\phi \colon L \to \{0,1 \}$ for which $\phi (x) = 1$. Some form of Choice is needed to guarantee the existence of sufficiently many morphisms. If we assume $L$ is finitely distributive and join-complete $-$ has arbitrary suprema $-$ then $\Phi$ will be closed under arbitrary unions.

And then there are group actions acting on smooth manifolds -- here I see the use of the word ""Geometry"" as well when results are obtained regarding the basic structure of the manifold, such as the way orbits are arranged, whether there are special orbits and how orbits smoothly collapse, whether these are certain bundles and so on.

Is it true that $f(x) = k^n$ for infinitely many integers $k$ and $x$ if and only if all roots of $f(x)$ are equal? One side of the proof is fairly simple. If all roots of $f(x)$ are equal, then $f(x) = (x-x_1)^n$, where $x_1$ is the root of $f(x)$ Now I have problems with the other side. I don't know how to start. I started looking at special cases and I proved it for $n=2$. Let $f(x) = x^2 + ax + b$. Then the roots are $x_1 = \frac{-a + \sqrt{D}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{ -a - \sqrt{D}}{2}$ Then $f(x) = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)$. Now set $f(x)$ to $k^2$ and we have: $$(2x + a + \sqrt{D})(2x + a - \sqrt{D}) = (2k)^2$$
$$(2x + a)^2 - D = (2k)^2$$ Since $D$ is some fixed number for some large enough $x$ we will have: $$(2x+a - 1)^2 < (2x+a)^2 - D < (2x+a+1)^2$$ Hence $(2x+a)^2 - D = (2x +a)^2 \implies D=0 \implies x_1 = x_2$ But i'm stuck for $n=3$ and more generally you can't use this method when the degree of $f(x)$ is bigger than 4, since there's no explicit formula for the roots of $f(x)$","['arithmetic', 'polynomials', 'radicals', 'algebra-precalculus']"

$$
f(n+m) = a^m f(n) + \frac{1-a^m}{1-a} b

Consequently, but only for $|a| < 1$ :
$$
f(\infty) = \lim_{m\to\infty} f(n+m) = b/(1-a)

And if $|a|\ge 1$ then this limit and so $f(\infty)$ does not exist. However, once upon a time on the internet, sci.math to be precise, I've seen an argument like this - the original is in ASCII:
$$
f(n+1) = a f(n) + b

f(\infty) = f(\infty+1) = a f(\infty) + b

I assume that L=3 because : $$\sqrt{6+\sqrt{6+\sqrt{6+\sqrt{6........}}}}=2.999 \cong  3$$ I really don't think that this method is good enough to established that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} a_n= 3$ since it based on intuition. I'll be glad to hear any ideas for an established method to show this.? Any help will be appreciated.,"['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'limits', 'convergence-divergence']"

1187577,Use integral test to show that Gaussian Integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \ dx$ converges?,"There's a question in my book (it's a school-specific textbook) saying: Use the integral test to show $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \ dx$$ (the Gaussian Integral) converges. The integral test says if the integral converges, so does the series. But I have no idea how to represent this as a series, do I need to? I'm not looking to evaluate it - I've read about it online - but how do I use the integral test here? Thanks","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'integration']"

similarly, if the second card is one of the twos; the third card is one of the threes, etc.; until

1187631,Hermitian Matrices with At Most Pair-wise Eigenvalue Degeneracy,"Let $n\in2\mathbb{N}$ be given. Let $H\in Mat_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ be a Hermitian traceless matrix such that its eigenvalues have at most pairwise degeneracy. (That is, if the eigenvalues are $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^n$ then we allow that $\lambda_i = \lambda_{i+1} \forall i\in\{1,3,\dots,n-1\}$, but no other degeneracies other than that.) Conjecture : The set of all such matrices $H$ is homotopy-type-equivalent to $S^m$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$. Question: Is this conjecture true? If yes, how to prove it, if no, is there anything else this is homotopy-type-equivalent to?","['algebraic-topology', 'linear-algebra', 'general-topology']"
1187637,The existence of the $n$th derivative at $c$ presumes the existence of the $(n-1)$st derivative in an interval containing $c$,"The following is from Introduction to Real Analysis by Bartle. If the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f$ exists at every point $x$ in an interval $I$ containing a point $c$, then we can consider the existence of the derivative of the function $f'$ at the point $c$. In case $f'$ has a derivative at the point $c$, we refer to the resulting number as the second derivative of $f$ at $c$ and we denote this number by $f''(c)$. In similar fashion we define the third derivative $f^{(3)}(c)$, and the nth derivative $f^{(n)}(c)$, whenever these derivatives exist. It is noted that the existence of the $n$th derivative at $c$ presumes the existence of the $(n-1)$st derivative in an interval containing $c$ , but we do allow the possibility that $c$ might be an endpoint of such an interval. My question is, does the existence of the $n$th derivative necessarily guarantee that the $(n-1)$st derivative exists in an interval containing $c$? I understand that $c$ must be an accumulation point in the domain of the $(n-1)$st derivative, but I don't see why the domain necessarily have to be an interval. For instance, $f(x)=x^2$ defined on ${\frac{1}{n}|n\in \mathbb{N}}\cup {0}$ has a derivative at $0$ but the domain is clearly not an interval.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

1187653,"Deriving $Cov(X,Y,Z)$, is it even a thing?","So I am trying to derive a nice general formula for $Cov(X,Y,Z)$ and $Corr(X,Y,Z)$, I defined it as such 
$$
Cov(X,Y,Z) = E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])(Z-E[Z])]
$$
$$
Corr(X,Y,Z) = \frac {Cov(X,Y,Z)} {\sqrt{Var[X]Var[Y]Var[Z]}}
$$ Now doing some algebra got me to this expression: 
$$
Cov(X,Y,Z) = E[XYZ]-E[Z]E[XY]-E[X]E[ZY]-E[Y]E[XZ]+2E[X]E[Y]E[Z]
$$ When I apply this formula however, my correlation is sometimes over 1 and below -1. I have two questions: 1) Is the covariance ever defined this way (because I notice people always refer to the covariance matrix)? 2) Was my algebra wrong, or is the property $ |COV|\le1 $ is not transferable to 3 r.v.s?","['covariance', 'statistics', 'expectation']"
