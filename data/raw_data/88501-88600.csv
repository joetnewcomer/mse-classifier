1189428,Is a compact subset of the space of Radon measures Polish?,"Denote by $M(\mathbb{R})$ the space of Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}$ considered as the topological dual of $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ equipped with the locally convex inductive limit topology (as is done by Bourbaki). Equip $M(\mathbb{R})$ with the weak-* topology, i.e. $\mu_n \to \mu$ iff $\int f \, d\mu_n \to \int f \, d\mu$ for all $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$. For a subset $H \subseteq M(\mathbb{R})$ the following are equivalent:
$H$ is relatively compact iff $H$ is bounded iff $H$ is equicontinuous. It is known that $M(\mathbb{R})$ is not metrizable.
The subspace of positive measures is metrizable and moreover Polish. I thought to have read somewhere that compact subsets of $M(\mathbb{R})$ are Polish, but I don't know whether this statement is really true. Does anyone know of a proof (maybe in a more general setup) or a counterexample? Moreover, is the space $M(\mathbb{R})$ of all Radon measures in some way close to Polish,  e.g. Lusin or Souslin?","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1189739,"If for $x,y \in S$, $x^2\circ y =y = y \circ x^2 $, then prove that $(S, \circ)$ is an abelian group.","Let $(S, \circ)$ be a semigroup. If for $x,y \in S$, $x^2\circ y =y = y \circ x^2 $, then prove that $(S, \circ)$ is an abelian group. My Try: Let $p \in S$. Then $p^2 \in S$ and for all $a \in S,p^2\circ a =a = a \circ p^2 $, by the given condition. This shows that $p^2$ is an identity. Similarly if $q \in S$ then $q^2$ is an identity. By the given condition $p^2\circ q^2 =q^2 = q^2 \circ p^2$ and also $q^2 \circ p^2 = p^2 =p^2\circ q^2 $. So $p^2 = q^2$. This proves that there exists only one identity element in $S$. Let $e$ be the identity in $S$. Then for all $x \in S, x^2\circ e =e = e \circ x^2$ by the given condition , $x^2 = e, x = x^{-1}$. Therefore for all $x \in S, x^{-1} \in S$. Thus $(S, \circ)$ is a group. Let $a,b \in S$ then $a \circ b \in S$ and $a = a^{-1}, b = b^{-1}, a \circ b = (a \circ b )^{-1}$. $a \circ b  = (a \circ b )^{-1} = b^{-1} \circ a^{-1} = b \circ a$.

In this case '$\equiv$' refers to there being a homeomorphism, topological equivalent, from one topological space to the other. Now if I understand correctly, a topology is a family of subsets of $X$ satisfying the following condition. (1) $X,\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$, (2) The union of any family of members of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$, and (3) The intersection of any finite family of members of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

So the inequality becomes: 
$$2 \frac {E_{n}(x) - \frac {x^n}{n!}} {E_n(x)} \ge \frac {E_{n+1}(x) - \frac {x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}} {E_{n+1}(x)} + \frac {E_{n-1}(x) - \frac {x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}} {E_{n-1}(x)}$$

Meat (5): Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Salmon, Anchovies
Cheese (2): Mozzarella, Feta In how many ways can a customer's order pad choose exactly one topping from each category? In how many ways can an order choose exactly two toppings from each category, if they aren't allowed to circle a topping twice (i.e no repeats)? In how many ways can an order pad choose up to two toppings from each category, if they aren't allowed to circle a topping twice? (No toppings are allowed).

If not, what's wrong with my answers? My justifications: For number 1, the question is asking for one topping from each category. The order doesn't matter so it's a combination problem. The first and second digit represent the total number of choices and the number of options you are allowed to pick, respectively. Thanks to the kind users in the comment section, I know understand that I was wrong to put in addition symbols, and that there should in fact be multiplication symbols in number 1. This problem is very similar to number one except you can't repeat toppings. This means that the number of options you have to chose from the second time around are one less. This one was rather tricky, and I doubt my answer here but I simply applied combination logic (i.e total number of choices, how many you are allowed to choose). Here repetition is allowed so I picked the proper combination formula for that: $\frac{(n + r - 1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$ This problem asked only for the veggie topping pizzas with at least two toppings, so the answer was $C(7, 2).$","['combinations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

1190614,Why restriction to $B(\alpha)$ is a homomorphism from $Gal(E/B)$ to a group with kernel $Gal(E/B(\alpha))$?,"I'm reading Galois Theory for Beginners by John Stillwell. It's a good introduction, giving the essence of the idea with minimum algebra complexity. However, I'm a bit lost at his Theorem 2 (the details are at the end). The proof intend to find a homomorphism of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$, with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$, into an abelian group. John says: The obvious map with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is restriction
  to $B(\alpha)$, $\lvert_{B(\alpha)}$, since by definition $$\sigma \in
\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) \Leftrightarrow \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \texttt{ is the
 identity map}.$$ Why restriction to $B(\alpha)$ is a homomorphism from $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ to a group with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$? What does this ""restriction"" mean? Trying to understand it, I'm taking $B = \mathbb Q$, $\alpha = \zeta$, $B(\alpha) =\mathbb Q(\zeta)$, $E = \mathbb Q (\zeta, \sqrt{2})$,  where $\zeta^5 = 1$. So $$\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) =  \texttt{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb Q(\zeta)), $$ 
in this example  it is $\begin{array}{c|cc}
 \mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})  & \sigma_1 & \sigma_2  \\ 
\hline
\sqrt{2}  & \sqrt{2}  & -\sqrt{2}   \\

\zeta     & \zeta     & \zeta   \\

\zeta^3   & \zeta^3   & \zeta^3  \\
\zeta^4   & \zeta^4   & \zeta^4,  
\end{array}$ so it's isomorphism to 
$$S_2 = \{(1), (1,2)\}.$$ Then  $$\texttt{Gal}(E/B) = \texttt{Gal} (\mathbb Q(\zeta, \sqrt{2})/\mathbb Q),$$
in this example it is $\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}

\zeta^2   & \zeta^2 & \zeta^4 & \zeta   & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta^4 & \zeta & \zeta^3 \\
\zeta^3   & \zeta^3 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^2 & \zeta^3 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^2 \\
\zeta^4   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta   & \zeta^4 & \zeta^3 & \zeta^2 & \zeta,
\end{array}$ so it's isomorphism to
$$\{(1), (3,4,5,6), (3,5,6,4), (3,6)(4,5), (1,2), (1,2)(3,4,5,6), (1,2)(3,5,6,4), (1,2)(3,6)(4,5) \}.$$ My guess is, so that the ""restriction to $B(\alpha)$"" actually means a subset of $\texttt{Gal} (E/B)$ that only change elements in $B(\alpha)$, so itcan be defined as
$$\Sigma := \{ \tau \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B) \lvert \tau(\beta) = \beta, \forall \beta \in E \setminus B(\alpha) \},$$
in this example $\begin{array}{c|c}

\end{array}$ Is my understanding correct? -- Theorem 2 details -- Any radical extension $F(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k)$ is the union of an ascending tower of fields $F=F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_k = F(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k)$ where each $F_i = F_{i-1}(\alpha_i)$, $\alpha_i$ is the $p_i$-th rot of an element in $F_i{i-1}$, $p_i$ is prime, and $F_i$ contains no $p_i$-th roots of unity not in $F_i{i-1}$ unless $\alpha_i$ is itself a $p_i$-th root of unity. Theorem 2. If $E\supseteq B(\alpha) \supseteq B$ are fields with $\alpha^p \in B$ for some prime $p$, and if $B(\alpha)$ contains no $p$th roots of unity not in $B$ unless a itself is a $p$th root of unity, then $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is a normal subgroup of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ and $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)/\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is abelian. Proof: By the homomorphism theorem for groups, it suffices to find a homomorphism of $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$, with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$, into an abelian group (i.e., onto a subgroup of an abelian group, which of course is also abelian). The obvious map with kernel $\texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha))$ is restriction to $B(\alpha)$, $\lvert_{B(\alpha)}$, since by definition
$$\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B(\alpha)) \Leftrightarrow \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \texttt{ is the identity map}.$$ The homomorphism property,
$$\sigma' \sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}=\sigma'\lvert_{B(\alpha)} \sigma\lvert_{B(\alpha)}, \forall \sigma', \sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B),$$
is automatic provided $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}(b) \in B(\alpha)$ for each $b \in B(\alpha)$, i.e. provided $B(\alpha)$ is closed under each $\sigma \in \texttt{Gal}(E/B)$. Since $\sigma$ fixes $B$, $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)}$ is completely determined by the value $\sigma(\alpha)$. If $\alpha$ is a $p$th root of unity then
$$(\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \sigma(\zeta^p) = \sigma(1) = 1,$$
hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^i= \alpha^i \in  B(\alpha)$, since each $p$th root of unity is some $\zeta^i$. If $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then
$$ (\sigma(\alpha))^p = \sigma(\alpha^p) = \alpha^p \texttt{ since } \alpha^p \in B,$$
hence $\sigma(\alpha) = \zeta^ia$ for some $p$th root of unity $\zeta$; and $\zeta \in B$ by hypothesis, so a\texttt{Gal}in $\sigma(\alpha) \in B(\alpha)$. Thus $B(\alpha)$ is closed as required. This also implies that $I_{B(\alpha)}$ maps $\texttt{Gal}(E/B)$ into $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$, so it now remains to check that $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is abelian. If $\alpha$ is a root of unity then, as we have just seen, each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form $\sigma_i$, where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \alpha^i$,
hence
$$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\alpha^j) = \alpha^{ij} = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha).$$
Likewise, if $\alpha$ is not a root of unity then each $\sigma \lvert_{B(\alpha)} \in \texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is of the form
$\sigma_i$ where $\sigma_i(\alpha) = \zeta^i\alpha$, hence
$$\sigma_i\sigma_j(\alpha) = \sigma_i(\zeta^j\alpha) = \zeta^{i+j}\alpha = \sigma_j\sigma_i(\alpha)$$
since $\zeta \in B$ and therefore $\zeta$ is fixed. Hence in either case $\texttt{Gal}(B(\alpha)/B)$ is abelian.","['galois-theory', 'group-homomorphism', 'abstract-algebra']"

1190660,Integral identity related with cubic analogue of arithmetic-geometric mean,"Let $a,b$ be positive real numbers and we define two sequences $\{a_{n}\},\{b_{n}\}$ as follows:

Then it is not so difficult to show that both the sequences $\{a_{n}\},\{b_{n}\}$ tend to a common limit which may be denoted by $M_{3}(a,b)$, the cubic arithmetic geometric mean of $a$ and $b$. It also turns out that there is an integral representation of this cubic arithmetic geometric mean. Let us define
$$I(a,b)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{t\,dt}{\sqrt[3]{(t^{3}+a^{3})(t^{3}+b^{3})^{2}}}\tag{2}$$ Then we have the relation $$M_{3}(a, b) = \frac{I(1, 1)}{I(a, b)}\tag{3}$$

The question I have is the following: Suppose $X$ is a manifold and $G=\pi_1(X)$ is its fundamental group, is it true that $p:\tilde{X}\rightarrow X$ is a universal principal $G$-bundle? I think it is not true in general, because I read somewhere in the book "" Fiber Bundles"" by Husemoller that a classifying principal bundle (P,B,G) must have the property that P is contractible.

1191355,Generating Functions - Extracting Coefficients,"In many counting problems, we find an appropriate generating function which allows us to extract a given coefficient as our answer. In cases where the generating function is not one that is easily used as an infinite sum, how does one alter the generating function for simpler coefficient extraction? The question I'm looking at involves the following generating function: f( x ) = ($x^3$ + $x^4$ + . . . + $x^8$)$^4$, and we seek the coefficient of $x^2$$^4$ in f( x ). To start, we convert to a simpler form. With ($x^3$ + $x^4$ + . . . + $x^8$)$^4$ = $x^1$$^2$(1 + x + $x^2$ + . . . + $x^5$)$^4$ = $x^1$$^2$((1 - $x^6$)/(1 - x))$^4$, the answer is the coefficient of $x^1$$^2$ in (1 - $x^6$)$^4$(1 - x)$^-$$^4$ Why is this true?

1191377,Definition of a Minimal Set,"A few times while studying math I have encountered the notion of a ""minimal set"". For example, given some set of subsets, what is the ""minimal"" sigma algebra generated by that set of subsets? Or, in the example I am currently studying: one of the ZFC axioms ensures the existence of an inductive set. Therefore, we define the natural numbers to be the minimal inductive set. I am trying to think of some other examples, but I can't remember off the top of my head. Feel free to comment if you think of some other examples of minimal sets. Here is my question. I have seen the ""minimal"" set defined different ways, and I am not sure which statement is definition and which is an implication of the definition. The first definition I have seen is to call a set $M$ satisfying some property minimal if, for every other set $A$ satisfying the same property as the set $M$, we have $M \subseteq A$:
\begin{equation*}
M \textrm{ is the minimal set with property } P \iff (\forall A \textrm{ satisfying property P }) M \subseteq A
\end{equation*} The second definition I have seen is to define the minimal set $M$ satisfying some property to be the intersection of all other sets satisfying the same property:
\begin{equation*}
M \textrm{ is the minimal set in some class } C \iff M=\bigcap C
\end{equation*} The second definition seems more concise, however in the example I am studying right now (defining the set of natural numbers to be the minimal inductive set), I don't know if such a set $C$ (the set of all inductive sets) exists, so I am not even sure if the right hand side of definition 2 even makes any formal logical sense.

1191405,"Show that bilinear form is $H^1(0,l)$-elliptic/coercive","Let
$$a(u,v) := \int_0^l \partial u(x) \partial v(x) + cu(x)v(x)\, \mathrm{d}x + \alpha u(l)v(l)$$
Show that $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is $H^1(0,l)$-elliptic if either $c > 0$ or $\alpha > 0$. My attempt at a solution: The case where $\alpha$ is $0$ is straightforward. I am stuck on the $c =0$ and $\alpha > 0$ case. I need to show that 
\begin{align}
\int_0^l (\partial v(x))^2 \, \mathrm{d}x + \alpha u(l)v(l) \ge \int^l_0 (\partial v(x))^2 + v(x)^2 \, \mathrm{d}x.
\end{align}
 I've been comparing the terms of the $||v||_{H^1}$ term by term to the bilinear form - clearly, $a(v,v) \ge \int_0^l (\partial v(x))^2$, so that term is fine. But I can't figure out why $a(v,v) \ge c_0 \int_0^lv(x)^2$. The only estimate that I found to work with is that $|u(l)| \le 2l^{1/2} ||\partial u||_{L^2} + 2l^{-1/2}||u||_{L^2}$, and that's not getting me anywhere.","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
