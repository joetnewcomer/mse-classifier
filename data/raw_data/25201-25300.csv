226799,Fake homeomorphism between $R$ and $R^2$,"I attended a lecture today in which we were given the proof of non-existence of homeomorphisms between $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb R^2$. I came up with the following bijection between $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb R^2$ but could not prove why this doesn't qualify as a valid homeomorphism. Map $(x,y) \rightarrow (\frac 1 \pi (\tan ^{-1} x + \pi/2), \frac 1 \pi (\tan ^{-1} y + \pi/2))$. This map is continuous, bijective and maps $\mathbb R^2$ to the unit square. Now, for every pair $(x,y)$ with $x = 0.a_1a_2 \cdots, y = 0.b_1b_2 \cdots$ being their decimal expansions, define $$f(x,y) = 0.a_1b_1a_2b_2 \cdots$$
$f(x,y)$ is a continuous bijection between the unit square and the interval $(0,1)$ Now, just map $x \rightarrow \tan (\pi x - \pi/2)$ to get a continuous bijection between $(0,1)$ and $\mathbb R$. Why isn't the composition of these functions a homeomorphism between $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb R^2$?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
226820,Evolution by death and immigration of Poisson distributed population,"This is quite an interesting problem, but I'm not sure how to go about doing it. I know that by using some basic Poisson properties I can figure it out but I'm failing to see how. It goes like this: A population comprises of $X_n$ individuals at time $n=1,2,3...$ Suppose that $X_0$ has Poisson ($\mu$) distribution. Between time $n$ and time $n+1$ each of the $X_n$ individuals dies with probability $p$, independently of the others. The population at time $n+1$ is formed from the survivors together with a random number of immigrants who arrive independently according to a Poisson ($\mu$) distribution. What is the distribution of $X_n$? I feel that I'm close but can't quite get it. It sounds like I could set up a series and then maybe prove it by induction.","['probability-theory', 'induction', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

This is what I done with the hint I got: $$\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}\frac{\sin(kx)}{\sin^{k}(x)}=\frac{1}{2i}\sum_{k=1}^{k=n}((\frac{e^{xi}}{\sin(x)})^{k}-(\frac{e^{-xi}}{\sin(x)})^{k})=\frac{1}{2i}(\underbrace{\sum_{k=0}^{k=n}(\frac{e^{xi}}{\sin(x)})^{k}}_{S_{1}}-\underbrace{\sum_{k=0}^{k=n}(\frac{e^{-xi}}{\sin(x)}}_{S_{2}})^{k})

226899,(Weil divisors : Cartier divisors) = (p-Cycles : ? ),"Suppose $X$ verifies the suitable conditions in which Weil (resp. Cartier) divisors make sense. The group of Weil divisors $\mathrm{Div}(X)$ on a scheme $X$ is the free abelian group generated by codimention $1$ irreducible subvarieties. The sheaf of Cartier divisors is $\mathrm{Cart}_X:=\mathcal{K}_X^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_X^{\times}$. The group of Cartier divisors is $\mathrm{Cart}(X):=\Gamma(X,\mathrm{Cart}_X)$. The group $Z^p(X)$ of $p$-cycles is the free abelian group generated by irreducible subvarieties of codimension $p$, so in particular $\mathrm{Div}(X)=Z^1(X)$. So the notion of $p$-cycle is a direct generalization of the notion of Weil divisor. My question: Is there an analogous notion of group of ""Cartier $p$-cycles"" $\mathrm{Cart}^p(X)$?

227177,What is the probability of an independent event occurring after repeated attempts?,"Let's suppose that I have an event whose probability of occurring is $\frac{44}{1000}$. Let's also assume that I can make multiple independent attempts at observing the event. I want to know what the compounded probability is that the event would occur after a certain number of tries.  My intuition is that each event has the same chance of occurring as each attempt is completely independent. Since I couldn't reason my way out of it, I thought instead about the probability of the event NOT occurring.  I asked myself ""What is the probability of the event NOT occurring x times in a row?"" Since these attempts are independent and the probability of 2 independent events occurring in sequence is $P=P(A)*P(B)$, I computed $P=(1-\frac{44}{1000})^x$ With $x=100$, $P\approx 1.1\%$.  Applying the same logic again this means that the probability of not not seeing the event in 100 attempts is $1-P(100)=98.9\%$  Following this reasoning, at x=323 Excel returns 0, meaning near $100\%$ probability (this is of course an artifact of finite precision, it approaches but not reaches 0). This seems to contradict the earlier statement that each event had an independent probability of $\frac{44}{1000}$.

we can define an interesting map $\mathcal{D}\colon L^p\to \left(L^p\right)^\star$ as follows:
$$\mathcal{D}u=\frac{\lvert u \rvert^{p-1}\text{signum}(u)}{\left(\int_{\Omega}\lvert u \rvert^p\, d\mu\right)^{\frac{p-2}{p}}},$$
(with the convention that $\mathcal{D}0=0$). This map $\mathcal{D}$ is non-linear, except for $p=2$ in which case it becomes the Riesz isomorphism of the Hilbert space $L^2$ with its dual. Also, $\mathcal{D}$ is norm-preserving and is characterized by the following property: $\mathcal{D}u$ is the unique element of $\left(L^p\right)^\star$ such that 
  $$\tag{1} \lVert \mathcal{D}u\rVert_\star=\lVert u \rVert_p\quad \text{and}\quad \langle \mathcal{D}u,u\rangle=\lVert  \mathcal{D}u\rVert_{\star}\lVert u\rVert_p.$$ Moreover, $\mathcal{D}$ is invertible: indeed, as it is readily seen,
$$\mathcal{D}^{-1}v=\frac{\lvert v \rvert^{p'-1}\text{signum}(v)}{\left(\int_{\Omega}\lvert v \rvert^{p'}\, d\mu\right)^{\frac{p'-2}{p'}}}.$$
We can also characterize $\mathcal{D}^{-1}$ in complete analogy with what we have already done: $\mathcal{D}^{-1}v$ is the unique element of $L^p$ such that
  $$\tag{2}\lVert \mathcal{D}^{-1}v\rVert_p=\lVert v\rVert_{\star}\quad \text{and}\quad \langle v, \mathcal{D}^{-1}v\rangle=\lVert v\rVert_\star\lVert\mathcal{D}^{-1}v\rVert_p.$$ The question follows. Question Suppose that $X$ is an abstract Banach space. Which properties must $X$ have so that a mapping $\mathcal{D}\colon X \to X^\star$ is uniquely defined by property (1)? When is $\mathcal{D}$ bijective? As already mentioned in this question ,  the existence and bijectivity of $\mathcal{D}$ in $L^p$ space seem to have something to do with the uniform convexity of $L^p$ and $(L^p)^\star$. I guess there is something more general beneath the surface here. Thank you for reading.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

Now, I know this is true in the finitely generated case; in fact we have something stronger, since for finitely generated modules $M$ and $N$ , $M\otimes_{R}{N}=\{0\}$ if and only if $\operatorname{Ann}{M}+\operatorname{Ann}{N}=R$ . Back to the general non finitely generated case. Take $m\in{M}$ and $n\in{N}$ , both non-zero. Then in particular (using the result stated above or just by the fact that we are tensoring free modules), $m\otimes{n}$ is non-zero as an element of $R{m}\otimes_{R}{R{n}}$ . Consider now the short exact sequence $0\rightarrow{Rn}\rightarrow{N}\rightarrow{N/Rn}\rightarrow{0}$ Let's now tensor this sequence by the module $mR$ . Since $M$ is torsion-free, this means we are tensoring by a free (hence flat) module, and so we get a short exact sequence $0\rightarrow{mR\otimes_{R}Rn}\rightarrow{mR\otimes_{R}{N}}\rightarrow{mR\otimes_{R}{N/Rn}}\rightarrow{0}$ and so we deduce that since $m\otimes{n}$ is non-zero in $mR\otimes_{R}Rn$ and this module embeds in $mR\otimes_{R}{N}$ , that $m\otimes{n}$ is non-zero as an element of $mR\otimes_{R}{N}$ . This is as far as I've managed to get. A couple of points to note: If I was working over a semiheriditary domain, then modules are flat if and only if they are torsion-free, and so I believe the result should always hold in this case. Thus if a counter example to my question exists, we must work over domains in which every there are non-projective finitely generated ideals.
Since I can't find a statement, never mind a proof, of this result anywhere, I feel it's probably false. However, intuitively (to me at least), it should be true, for it feels like whenever I've seen an example about how to show some element $m\otimes{n}$ of a tensor product is zero, it usually involves some sort of argument with the bilinearity properties of the tensor and the torsion properties of the module.

227731,"Given a model of ZF where $ \mathbb{R} $ is the countable union of countable sets, does every subset of $ \mathbb{R} $ have measure zero?","The question basically says it all. It is a well-known result that there exists a model $ \mathcal{M} $ of ZF with the property that $ \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{M}} $ (here, $ \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{M}} $ is the element of $ \mathcal{M} $ that $ \mathcal{M} $ thinks is its real-number field) is the countable union of countable sets. How can this be compatible with the assertion that the unit interval $ [0,1]^{\mathcal{M}} $ (the object that $ \mathcal{M} $ thinks is the unit interval) has measure $ 1 $? Herein lies the problem. Every countable set has measure $ 0 $, hence a countable union of countable sets is a countable union of measure-$ 0 $ sets, which, in turn, implies that $ \mathbb{R} $ has measure $ 0 $. It then follows that $ [0,1] $ has measure $ 0 $.

Suppose further that $S$ is closed under a commutative, associative law of multiplication denoted by $\cdot$. Say that $\cdot$ distributes over $+$ in the usual way. Finally, for every $s\in S$, suppose there exists some element $t$, not necessarily unique, such that $s\cdot t=s$. Essentially, $S$ is one step removed from being a ring; the only problem is that the multiplicative identity is not unique. Here is an example. Let $S=\{\text{Continuous functions} f: \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \ \text{with compact support}\}$ with addition and multiplication defined pointwise. It is clear that this is an abelian group with the necessary law of multiplication. Now, let $f\in S$ be supported on $[a,b]$. Let $S'\subset S$ be the set of continuous functions compactly supported on intervals containing $[a,b]$ that are identically 1 on $[a,b]$. Clearly, if $g\in S'$, then $f\cdot g=f$ for all $x$.

The following proposition is Lemma 7.1.3 of Grothendieck's EGA I, Ch. 0. Proposition Suppose a linearly topologized ring $A$ has an ideal of definition $I$.
Suppose $x$ mod $I$ is nilpotent in $A/I$.
Then $x$ is topologically nilpotent. The proof of EGA is as follows.
Let $V$ be a neighborhood of $0$.
There exists an integer $n > 0$ such that $I^n \subset V$.
