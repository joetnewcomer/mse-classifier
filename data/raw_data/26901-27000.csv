I have looked into: Frobenius Norm but I don't know what should be my threshold for comparison. Looking at max and min deviation of one matrix from the other. But again, what's a good threshold? I thought that to say one matrix varies significantly from the other, I would need to quantify the variance of those terms and compare how the deviation compares to the variance (or SD) but sadly, I don't have data for that and neither can I theoretically estimate any variances.

247476,Calculating probability of some event using geometric considerations,"I want to estimate exponentially the following probability: Let $\bf{U}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ be a random vector uniformly distributed on the $n$-dimensional hypersphere, centered at the origin with radius $R$, and let $A\in\mathbb{S}_{++}^{n\times n}$ be a positive definite and deterministic matrix. I want to estimate the probability that 
$$
\text{Pr}(||\bf{v}-A\bf{U}||^2\approx n\alpha) = ?\ \ \ (1).
$$ As example, when $A$ is an identity matrix, we have 
$$
\text{Pr}(||\bf{v}-\bf{U}||^2\approx n\alpha)
$$ 
which can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly vector $\bf{U}$ on the hypersphere ($R$) will fall on the hypersphere centered around $\bf{v}$ with radius $\approx\sqrt{n\alpha}$. Equivalently, we want to find the probability that a randomly vector $\bf{U}$ on the hypersphere ($R$) would have some ""correlation"" coefficient (Pearson product), $\beta$, with $\bf{v}$. This probability can be calculated as the fraction between the surface area of the $n-2$ dimensional ""circle"" with radius $R\sin(\gamma)$ (in which $\beta = \cos(\gamma)$), and the $n$ dimensional sphere of radius $R$. It is easily can be shown that as $n\to\infty$ this probability is given by $\exp(n\ln(1-\beta^2)/2)$. When we introduce the matrix $A$, then $\bf{Y} = AU$ lives on the the $n$-dimensional hyper-ellipsoid . Accordingly, we want to find the probability that a randomly vector $\bf{Y}$ on the hyper-ellipsoid will fall on the hypersphere centered around $\bf{v}$ with radius $\approx\sqrt{n\alpha}$. So we need to find the fraction between the surface area of the interaction of this two shapes, and the surface area of the hyper-ellipsoid.

247525,"Checking if one ""special"" kind of block matrix is Hurwitz","I have the next block matrix $$
J = \begin{bmatrix}A & B \\ K &0\end{bmatrix}
$$
all matrices are square, where $A < 0$ (definite negative), $B$ has all its eigenvalues with positive real part being $A = - (B + B^T)$, and $K$ is a diagonal matrix. What I see from numerical simulation, is that if $$K < 0 \iff J \text{ is Hurwitz}$$. Any clue about how can I prove this? Another question, I have seen many times that $$
M = \begin{bmatrix}A & B \\ -B^T &0\end{bmatrix}
$$ is Hurwitz if $A < 0$, but I can not find the proof for it. I guess it is really
related to the former question. Many thanks in advance. Edit More ideas related to the second question. $M$ is Hurwitz and its characteristic polynomial is det$(\lambda^2I - A\lambda + BB^T)=0$. The cp of J is det$(\lambda^2I + (B + B^T)\lambda - BK) = 0$. Looking at the two cps, $-A > 0$ and $B+B^T > 0$, and $BB^T > 0$ and $-BK$ has its Eigenvalues with positive real part $\iff BK + K^TB^T < 0$. Is this fact related to being Hurwitz ? I mean, the block matrix is Hurwitz if its cp det$(\lambda^2I + V\lambda + W)=0$ has $V > 0$ and $W > 0$ ? Edit 2 Thank you very much for your response in Answer1. You are right, and also I have found several counterexamples to this conjecture. However changing the condition (which has been proved wrong with a counter example) I have not found a counter example (yet).
Let $K = -cI$, with $c>0$ being a scalar. In other words, 
$$BK + K^TB^T < 0 \iff J \text{ is Hurwitz}$$. Finally, I have found a counter example (third comment to the answer 1). So this conjecture is wrong too. However, it seems that for $c$ sufficiently small, $J$ is Hurwitz, now I have to found the condition in $c$ for that. Any clues or suggestions? Edit 3 Finally, it has been found with counterexamples, that the last conjecture is false too. Then, the only way (as far as I know) that I have for assessing the stability of $J$ is to check the next linear matrix inequality. $$

247600,Probability of 15 consecutive green lights,"Introduction Upon a trip home, my mother and I were noticing a very peculiar occurrence: Traffic lights were almost continuously green. Indeed, exactly fifteen different traffic lights were green consecutively. Now, I am bad at probability, but this seems unlikely. Probability Application I reasoned that since there are three different options for all fifteen traffic lights, the probability of fifteen traffic lights being consecutively green was one in $_{15}P_{3}$. This is because there is only one sequence of traffic light configurations where all of them are green and we must count all of the possible traffic light configurations using a permutation since a sequence such as G,R,Y is not the same as Y,R,G. With that said, the probability of the event comes out to be approximately $0.0366\%$. Question Is this application of probability correct, incorrect, or somewhere in the middle?

247799,Prove the set of which sin(nx) converges has Lebesgue measure zero (from Baby Rudin Chapter 11),"I am trying to work through Rudin. This is a question from chapter 11: Suppose that $\{n_k\}$ is an increasing sequence of positive integers and $E$ is the set of all $x$ in $(-\pi,\pi)$ at which $\sin(n_kx)$ converges. Prove that $E$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Hint: For every subset $A$ of $E$, $\int_A \sin (n_kx) dx$ tends to zero, and $2\int_{A} \sin^2 (n_k x)dx$ tends to the measure of $A$. So, if I can use the hint, I'm pretty sure I can get the question. The thing is, I have no idea how to prove the hint. Using the hint, here's how I think you do the question: Define $f$ on $E$ as 
\begin{align*}f(x)= \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sin(n_kx) \end{align*}
Notice that $\sin(n_kx)\leq 1$, and $1\in L$ on $A\subset E$ for every measurable $A$ (since $E$ has finite measure), so Theorem $11.32$ in Rudin (the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem) says
\begin{align*} \int_A f(x) dx = \int_A \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sin(n_kx) =  \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \int_A \sin(n_kx) = 0 \end{align*}
(by the first hint). But this was true for all $A\subseteq E$, so by one of the questions on the last assignment, $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere on $E$ and so $f^2(x)=0$ almost everywhere on $E$. Using Theorem $11.32$ again, we get
\begin{align*} \mu(A) = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \int_A 2\sin^2(n_kx) = 2\int_A \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty}  \sin^2(n_kx)= 2 \int_A f^2(x)=0 \end{align*}
Therefore $\mu(E)=0$. Does anybody know how to prove the hint? Thanks!","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

Allow me to follow the convention in Jech's textbook: $1+\omega=\omega \ne \omega+1$ $2Â·\omega=\omega \ne \omegaÂ·2 =\omega+\omega$ Since the order-type of integers is the sum of that of negative integers and that of natural number, which is $\omegaÂ·2$ .

(1)\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} cos(j\lambda) = -\frac 1 2 + \frac{\sin(\frac{2n-1} 2 \lambda)}{2\sin(\frac \lambda 2)}.
\end{equation} and from the Hint in the first answer in How to show that $\frac{1}{\tan(x/2)}=2 \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\sin(jx)$ in CesÃ ro way/sense? $$

$$ This is what i did so far:
\begin{align}
\sum_{|j| < n} (n-|j|) \exp(ij\lambda) &= n + 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}(n-j) cos(j\lambda) \\
&=n + 2n \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} cos(j\lambda) - \frac d {d\lambda}\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} sin(j\lambda)\\
&= \frac{n\sin(\frac{2n-1} 2 \lambda)\sin(\frac \lambda 2) + \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 n \sin(\frac {n+1} 2 \lambda)\sin(\frac \lambda 2) + \frac 1 2 \cos( \frac{n\lambda}2)}{\sin^2(\frac \lambda 2)}.

$$
n\sin(\frac{2n-1} 2 \lambda)\sin(\frac \lambda 2) + \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 n \sin(\frac {n+1} 2 \lambda)\sin(\frac \lambda 2) + \frac 1 2 \cos( \frac{n\lambda}2) - \sin^2(\frac {n\lambda} 2) = 0.

(checked with Wolframalpha) So there is probably something wrong with my calculations. But i checked everything twice and don't see my mistake. Do you see it? EDIT Trying to prove it as proposed in the second answer. Let $z:=\exp(i\lambda)$ and $p(z):=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} z^j$.
First i want to show that $p(z)p(z^{-1})=\sum_{|j|<n} (n-|j|) z^j$. It is
\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} z^{j}&= p(z) - 1 = \frac{1-z^n}{1-z} - 1.\\
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} z^{-j}&= p(z^{-1})-1 = \frac{1-z^{-n}}{1-z^{-1}} - 1.\\
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} jz^{-j} &= i \frac d {d\lambda} p(z^{-1}) = \frac{-nz^{-n}+(n-1)z^{-n-1}+z^{-1}}{(1-z^{-1})^2}.\\
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} jz^{j} &= -i \frac d {d\lambda} p(z) = \frac{-nz^{n}+(n-1)z^{n+1}+z}{(1-z)^2}.\\
\end{align}
So i have
\begin{align}
\sum_{|j|<n} (n-|j|) z^j = n + n(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} z^{j} + \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} z^{-j}) - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} jz^{j} - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} jz^{-j}.
\end{align}
If i now put in the values from above and substract $p(z)p(z^{-1})$ i should get $0$. But Wolfram Alpha doesn't agree, so i am again on the wrong track. What did i wrong? The last step $p(z)p(z^{-1})= \frac{(z^{n/2}-z^{-n/2})^2}{(z^{1/2}-z^{-1/2})^2}$ was easy to show. EDIT2 I did it now.
It was a lot easier to show directly $p(z)p(z^{-1})=\sum_{|j|<n} (n-|j|) z^j$ without the geometric series partial sums values.","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

248304,estimation of transition probabilities from aggregate data,"Please, O mathematicians, help me understand the approach to the problem of estimating transition probabilities given only aggregate data in Kalbfleisch & Lawless' 1984 paper ""Least-Squares Estimation of Transition Probabilities from Aggregate Data"". (Or some other approachâit's the estimation that interests me, not that approach in particular.) Forgive the somewhat janky but hopefully comprehensible notation. Here's my particular problem. We have some number of people; each person $i$ is in a state $X_i(t)$ at time $t$ and can move at time $t+1$ into any state $0 \ldots X_i(t)+1$ inclusive. At time $t=0$ everyone is in state $0$. The individual state transitions are unobserved; all we observe are the counts of people in a given state $j$ at time $t$: $\mathbf{M}_{t,j} = \#\{i : X_i(t) = j\}$. Because everyone starts in state $0$ at time $0$, and because you can only move to at most state $k+1$ if you were formerly in state $k$, this generates an upper-triangular matrix of counts. We want to know the probabilities of the possible state transitions $\mathbf{p}_{k,j} = \Pr(X_i(t+1) = j \mid X_i(t) = k)$ given the counts in $\mathbf{M}$. Kalbfleisch & Lawless's paper seems to be about exactly this . (The paper is available here if you want to look at it.) However, I can't figure out how to apply their approach at all. (Doubtless because of my more general ignorance.) They give a couple of examples so I wanted to work through them and hit a wall pretty quickly. Some things in particular I am failing to understand: On p. 171 several equations are defined prefaced by the clause ""if there are no structural $0$'s, so that $r = k(k-1)$"" or ""if $r = k(k-1)$"". However, in the first example, there are structural zeroes and the answers given to the examples presume that (if you dont' take the structural zeroes into account the dimensions of several matrices will differ from what they are claimed to be in the text). There are also structural zeroes in my particular problem, so I would like to know if there's a straightforward way to proceed in that case. Also on p. 171 the matrices $\mathbf{B}_t$ are defined for $t = 1, \ldots, m$, but later equations involve the summation from $t = 1 \ldots m$ of terms involving $\mathbf{B}_{t-1}$, meaning that $\mathbf{B}_0$ must be defined. Perhaps more fundamentally I don't really understand why the last column of their matrix $\mathbf{P}$ is cut offâdon't we want to know e.g. $p_{13}$ as well as $p_{12}$? I suspect I am missing some very basic things, but I know very little about the subject (I'm interested in it for a particular practical problem). If anyone can help me understand how to compute what I'm after, or the mechanism described in the paper, that would be immensely helpful.

248391,Dirac Operators on $S^1$,"I am trying to understand the Dirac operators associated to the 2 spinor bundles on $S^1.$ I have been getting very confused about why one bundle has nontrivial harmonic spinors and the other doesn't.(Harmonic spinors are solutions $s$ to the equation $Ds = 0$ where $D$ is the Dirac operator and $s$ is a section.) Here is my argument (which must be wrong somewhere). We have 2 spin structures given by the connected 2-fold covering and the disconnected 2-fold covering. Since the tangent bundle $TS^1$ is trivial, we can choose the trivial connection on it given by $f \rightarrow df.$ When considered as a connection on the principal bundle of frames (also isomorphic to $S^1$), i.e. as a Lie algebra valued one form on $S^1,$ it must be the zero form. (As a quick aside, the Lie algebra of $SO(1)$ is just the $0$ Lie algebra, so it seems like there is only one connection on the tangent bundle of $S^1$ since we could only ever have the $0$-form as the connection form on our frame bundle. But this is not true, we can add a 1-form to any connection and get another connection. How can this be?) (EDIT: Answer provided by Eric: because we have implicitly reduced the structure group of the frame bundle to $SO(1),$ an $so(1)$ valued one form corresponds to a connection compatible with the given metric, and there is only one of these since the torsion of any connection on $S^1$ is zero.) Ok, so now given either spin structure, the connection must lift to the $0$ connection. Furthermore, any complex line bundle over the circle is trivial, so both cases look exactly the same, and the Dirac operator appears to be $f \rightarrow i\frac{df}{dx}.$ However, I am told that in the case of the connected double cover we should have an additional condition on our $f,$ namely that it should satisfy $f(-x) = -f(x).$ Where have I gone wrong? (2nd EDIT) I think I know where my confusion stems from. Given a spin structure $P$ on a manifold $M^n$ we can identify sections of the spinor bundle with smooth maps $f: P \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^n$ such that $f(pg) = g \cdot f(p)$ as follows. Take any discontinuous section $s: M \rightarrow P.$ This gives a section $t:M \rightarrow P \times_{Spin(n)} \mathbf{C}^n$ of the spinor bundle by the formula $t(m) = [s(m), f \circ s(m)],$ and by the compatibility condition on $f$ this is independent of the choice of section $s.$ It is via this identification that I understand how sections of the spinor bundle for the connected double cover must be functions $f: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbf{C}$ such that $f(-x) = f(x).$ And, as luck would have it, in this case the Spin structure on $S^1$ is itself, as a space, $S^1,$ so the description of the Dirac operator translates easily via this identification. But in the case of $S^2,$ for example, sections can be identified with maps from $S^3$ to $\mathbf{C}^2$ but the local description of the Dirac operator I see in books (like Lawson/Michelson's Spin Geometry) tells me how to differentiate maps $U \subset S^2 \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^2$ in a trivializing nbhd $U.$ How do I translate the local description of the Dirac operator so that it tells me how to differentiate the map $S^3 \rightarrow \mathbf{C}^2$?","['riemannian-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

248473,A question about functions in $L^p(E)$,"I've been working on a problem. I found a couple of related questions on the site, but I was having a little bit of trouble clarifying everything. The goal is to show that given $f\notin L^p(E)$, there exists a $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ such that $fg\notin L^1(E)$. Note this is the second part of Wheeden and Zygmund's Introduction to Real Analysis textbook. To show that for $f\notin L^p(E)$, there exists a $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ such that $fg\notin L^1(E)$, consider the following. Without loss of generality, we can assume all functions are nonnegative. Now, suppose there is a sequence $\{g_k\}_{k=1}^\infty\subseteq L^{p'}(E)$ with $\Vert g_k\Vert_{p'}=1$ and
    $$
        \int_E fg_k>3^{k}.
    $$
    Set 
    $$
        g=\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k}g_k
    $$
    and observe that, by Minkowski's inequality, $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}\leq 1$. Note that
    $$
        \int_E fg=\int_E f\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k}g_k>\int_E\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{k}=\infty.
    $$
    Thus, $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ but $fg\notin L^1(E)$.
    Hence, we have reduced the problem to showing that such a sequence exists. First note that if $f=\infty$ on any set $A$ of positive measure, then we can simply take $$g=\frac{1}{|B|}\text{ when }x\in B$$
where $B\subseteq A$ has positive, finite measure, and $g=0$ otherwise. Thus $g$ has the desired properties. This implies we can assume $f$ is finite a.e., and in particular, for any positive real number $c$, we can find a set $F$ with finite measure such that $\int_F f=c$. With this in mind, we can find a nested sequence of sets $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$, each with finite measure, such that $\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k=E$ and $\int_{E_k}f>3^k$. Now, take
    $$g_k=\frac{1}{|E_k|^{\frac{1}{p'}}} :\ x\in E_k$$
    By construction, $\Vert g_k\Vert_{p'}=1$, and it is easy to check that $\int fg_k\longrightarrow\infty$ as $k\to\infty$. Hence, we have the existence of the sequence, and we've demonstrated the existence of such functions $g$.

Since $\{X_i : i \in I\}$ is a disjoint family, for each $x \in \cup_{i \in I}X_i$, there exists exactly one $i \in I$, such that $x \in X_i$. So we could define a bijective function $f:\cup_{i \in I}X_i \to \cup_{i \in I}Y_i$, by $f(x)=f_i(x)$, if  $x \in X_i$. I don't see any usefulness of AC in problem 5.9, as opposed to problem 5.10, in which $|\cup_{i \in I}X_i| = |\cup_{i \in I}Y_i|$ is replaced by $|\prod_{i \in I}X_i| = |\prod_{i \in I}Y_i|$. The reason is that without AC, the cardinality of a cartesan product of non-empty sets is arbitary.","['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"
248547,Proving equivalences of statements equivalent to AC,"I'm doing the following exercise from Just/Weese: Show in ZF that (WO) implies (IC) and that (IC) implies (SC). where (WO) Every set can be well-ordered. (IC) For any two sets $X,Y$ either there is an injection $X \hookrightarrow Y$ or $Y \hookrightarrow X$. (SC) For any two sets $X,Y$ either there is an surjection $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ or $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$. (WO) $\rightarrow$ (IC): Let $X,Y$ be two sets. Then by (WO) they can be well-ordered. Therefore each is in bijection with an ordinal $\alpha$ (and $\beta$, respectively): Claim: Every well-ordered set is isomorphic to an ordinal. Proof: Let $\langle, X,W \rangle$ be a well-ordered set. Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal with $|\alpha| \ge |X|$. Define an injective map $f: X \hookrightarrow \alpha$ as follows: (i) Let $x_0$ be the $W$-minimal element. Then $x_0 \mapsto \varnothing$. (ii) Assume $f$ has been defined for $x \in I_W (x')$. Define $x' \mapsto \sup^+ f(I_W (x'))$. Let $\tilde{f} = f: X \to \mathrm{im}f$. Then $\tilde{f}$ is a bijection and $\mathrm{im}f$ is an initial segment of an ordinal hence also an ordinal.$\Box$ Either $\alpha \in \beta$ or $\beta \in \alpha$. Hence either $X \hookrightarrow Y$ or $Y \hookrightarrow X$. (IC) $\rightarrow$  (SC): Let $X,Y$ be sets. Then either $X \hookrightarrow Y$ or $Y \hookrightarrow X$. Given $X \hookrightarrow Y$ it is easy to construct a surjection $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$, similarly for $Y \hookrightarrow X$. Can you tell me if these proofs are correct? Thanks. I also wanted to prove (IC) $\rightarrow$ (WO), but I'm stuck. I thought of something like if $X$ is a set and $\alpha$ is an ordinal then either $X \hookrightarrow \alpha$ or $\alpha \hookrightarrow X$ but the latter case seems to be a dead end.","['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"
