385591,Question on sheafification of a presheaf,"In chapter 2 of GTM 52 by Robin Hartshone there are definition of presheaf and the associated sheaf of a given presheaf. I found that the definition of the sheafification is rather less natural and too rigorous. Harthshone did not give any non trivial concrete presheaf and its sheafification. My questions are : From the definition of a presheaf $\mathcal{F}$(as Hartshone defined) how can one think about its sheafification $\mathcal{F}^{+}$ as a collection of map : $s: U\rightarrow \cup \mathcal{F}_{p}$ for each open subset $U$ and why is $\cup \mathcal{F}_{p}$ rather than other sets ? Could you please show me a nontrivial, concrete example of a presheaf(that is not a sheaf itself) and its sheafification ? Thanks !","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
385598,Calculating integral with branch cut.,"I'm learning how to calculate integrals with branch points using branch cut. For example:
$$I=a\int_{\xi_{1}}^{\xi_{2}}\frac{d\xi}{(1+\xi^{2})\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}\left(E-U_{0}\xi^{2}\right)}}$$
where $\xi_{1}$, $\xi_{2}$ is branch points.
I've choosed contour like this: So, by using residue theorem (and changing sings that metion here ) $$I=2\pi i[Res(\infty)-Res(i)-Res(-i)]$$
Obviously
$$Res(\infty)=0$$
$$Res(i)=\frac{1}{2i}\frac{a}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}\left(E+U_{0}\right)}}$$
$$Res(-i)=-\frac{1}{2i}\frac{a}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{m}\left(E+U_{0}\right)}}$$ So I have a mistake somewhere because integral vanishes. The answer would be correct if there would be the minus sign before Res(i). I am totally confused by it. I will be grateful if you could tell me where my mistake, or give any links.","['residue-calculus', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'branch-cuts', 'complex-analysis']"

385619,prove that a set is infinite,"Suppose that $\mathbb{N}\le X$, show that X is infinite.

I hope my head get a little more satisfied by actually understanding the different ways to solve this problem.

5 & & & & 2 & \\ | & & & & | \\

I have to find the largest prime less than a number $n$. Note that $n\leq10^{18}$. I can go for Fermat's Little Theorem which runs in $O(\log n)$ time and then check whether the number is prime or not by checking for existence of its divisors from $2$ to $\sqrt n$. But this will take $O(\sqrt n)$ time which is way beyond the machine's capability.

385809,Different Perspectives of Multinomial Theorem & Partitions,"There are 2 important interpretations of the multinomial theorem and coefficients. 1:  Determining the number of ordered strings that can be formed using a set of letters.

For example, in a group of 11 candidates, how many ways can we form 4 committees such that one committee has only 1 member, another has 4 members, another has 4 members, and the fourth committee has 2 members (assuming each person can serve in one committee)?  Again the answer is $\binom{11}{1,4,4,2}=34,650$.  I also understand that multinomial coefficients are a shortcut to partitioning.  We could have equivalently written:  $\binom{11}{1}\binom{10}{4}\binom{6}{4}\binom{2}{2}=34,650$. I did one problem the other day ( Probability/Combinatorics Question ), and answered it.  However, I am reviewing the material and seem to get the concepts confused.  In the following question: At a picnic, there was a bowl of chocolate candy that had 10 pieces of Milky Way, Almond Joy, Butterfinger, Nestle Crunch, Snickers, and Kit Kat. Jen grabbed six pieces at random from this bowl of 60 chocolate candies. (b) What is the probability that Jen grabs exactly five varieties? When calculating the numerator of the probability, sometimes I am tempted to write $\binom{6}{2,1,1,1,1,0}$ instead of the correct $\binom{6}{4,1}$.  Sometimes I want to view a type of candy as a committee group.  So since we have 5 varieties, we have 5 committees where one committee has 2 people (or candies), and the rest of the 4 committees have 1 person (or 1 candy). Can anyone please explain why this is the wrong view and how I can stop confusing myself? Thank you in advance.","['probability', 'multinomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

385967,Origin of well-ordering proof of uniqueness in the FToArithmetic,"In the Appendix to Ivan Niven's book ""Numbers: Rational and Irrational"", he proves the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FToA) without using Euclid's Lemma that if a prime divides a product, then it divides one of the factors of the product.  Niven's proof instead uses well-ordering. He assumes that m is the smallest positive integer with two different prime factorizations, say $$ m=p_1 p_2 p_3 \ldots p_r \qquad \text{and} \qquad m=q_1 q_2 q_3 \ldots q_s $$ Typically, Euclid's Lemma would now be invoked repeatedly to say that each prime in one factorization of a number must also occur in any other, giving a contradiction. (Or more typically, this idea is rewritten as a direct proof.) Niven instead proceeds saying that the two factorizations cannot have a prime in common, since if they did, we could assume without loss of generality that p_1 = q_1.  Then $m/p_1$ would be a positive integer smaller than $m$ with the two different factorizations $$ m/p_1 = p_2 p_3 \ldots p_r \qquad \text{and} \qquad m/p_1 = q_2 q_3 \ldots q_s, $$ a contradiction. So without losing generality, we may assume $p_1 < q_1$.  Niven proceeds to show that the number $(q_1 - p_1) q_2 q_3 \cdots q_s$ is a positive integer smaller than $m$ with two different prime factorizations --- one containing $p_1$ as a factor and the other not.  This contradiction proves the uniqueness part of the FToA. My question is, who originated this proof?","['math-history', 'elementary-number-theory', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"

We had this particular question on homework a few weeks ago and we just had it again on an exam and I didn't get it. Here is the direction I tried to go in: If $f \in L_p$ and $\varepsilon > 0$ then we'll write $f=f^+-f^-$ where $f^+=\sup\{0,f\}$ and $f^-=\sup\{0,-f\}$. There then exists an increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions that converges to $f^+$, say $\phi_n \rightarrow f^+$ and similarly for $f^-$ say $\psi_n \rightarrow f^-$. Goal: Find some simple function $\phi$ where
$$\int \left\lvert f - \phi \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu < \varepsilon.$$ I propose some $\phi = \phi_n - \psi_n$ could be a canditate with appropriate $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So $$\left\lvert f - \phi \right\rvert^p = \left\lvert f^+-f^- - (\phi_n-\psi_n) \right\rvert^p = \left\lvert (f^+-\phi_n)-(f^--\psi_n) \right\rvert^p.$$ At this point I am having problems.

$$\int \left\lvert f-\phi \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu \leq \int \left\lvert f^+-\phi_n \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu + \int \left\lvert f^--\psi_n \right\rvert^p \mathrm{d}\mu$$

If, in addition, there is an element of $B$ which is not in $A$, then $A$ is said to be a proper subset of $B$. Definition 2: If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, we write $A=B$. Otherwise $A \ne B$. Based upon these definitions, it seems needless to differentiate between subset and proper subset. Take the following conjecture. Conjecture: Suppose $A \subset B$, and $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$. Then $A=B$ Proof: If $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$, then taking the converse of Definition 1 on proper subsets, there does not exist an element of $B$ that does not belong to $A$. However, that means that every element of $B$ must belog to $A$, which according to Definition 1 on subsets, $B \subset A$ and according Definition 2, $A=B$ Following what I had worked out above, what I am wondering is - Why differentiate between subset and proper subset? Given the fact that equality if provided by Definition 2, it seems to me that the retaining a concept of ""proper subset"" is frivolous.",['elementary-set-theory']

386326,Computing cohomology groups of elliptic curves,"I'm skimming through Silverman's text to recall some theory of elliptic curves that I've learned in undergrad. In practice however, I'm having trouble actually computing the cohomology groups. For instance, I know intuitively that $H^1(\mathbb{F}_q,E)$ will vanish, but how does one show this? Analogously, how does one compute $H^1(\mathbb{R},E)$? I know that for a field $k$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, the corresponding map $n:E(\bar k)\to E(\bar k)$ is surjective. This gives an exact sequence
\begin{equation}
0\to E(\bar k)[n]\to E(\bar k)\to^n E(\bar k)\to 0,
\end{equation}
which further gives the exact sequence
\begin{equation}
0\to E(k)[n]\to E(k)\to^n E(k)\to H^1(k,E(\bar k)[n])\\
\hspace{5em}\to H^1(k,E(\bar k))\to^n H^1(k,E(\bar k)).
\end{equation}
Hence from the long exact sequence we have
\begin{equation}
0\to E(k)/nE(k)\to H^1(k,E(\bar k)[n])\to H^1(k,E(\bar k))[n]\to 0.

The game is played as follows: Shuffle a standard $52$ card deck Lay the top $8$ cards face up If any two cards show the same value, lay on top of them the top two cards from the remaining deck, face up. Repeat step $3$ until no two cards showing have the same value, in which case you lose, or until all cards have been played, in which case you win. What is the probability of a win?  Just as a simple observation, if there are no pairs in the first $8$ cards, the game is lost immediately after step $2$. Of course, we could generalize by varying the number of total cards, the number of different possible values, and the number of cards with a particular value.  We could also change the number of cards we are allowed to lay face up to begin with, and as noted in the comments, we could require that all cards of the same value be covered up at step $3$, and not just pairs.","['card-games', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

386522,Roulette strategy,"I came up with a strategy, which imitates the martingale (doubling) strategy , but it seems that there is a good probability to gain profit, which I want to compute. So this is how we start: We do not bet on black/red, but we chose columns, or dozens. Let's say we start with 100 chips. Bet $1$ chip in e.g. a column. The probability to win is $12/37$ . If you win, start over again, while if you lose: Bet again $1$ chip to a column. Why again $1$ ? This is because we will still have profit if we win ( I will have won 3 chips, and lost 2 ). Again, if win go to step $1$ , if lose: Bet $2$ chips in a column. Each time we bet the lowest amount of funds, such that we have profit in case we win. In this case, if we win we will have played $4 $ chips , and won $6$ , which gives the minimum  profit( $2 $ chips). Continuing with this strategy, one has to bet in columns/dozens, the following sequence of chips (each time he loses), in order to have the minimum profit : $$1,1,2,3,4,6,9,14,21,31,47\dots$$ So, here is my question: Using this strategy, and starting with $100$ chips, what is the probability of gaining $+50\%$ , and what is the probability of doubling? You continue until you have doubled, and stop if you have less chips than they are required to put the next bet . *We have to consider that when we gain some profit, e.g. we have reached $140$ chips, we are able to bet more chips of the above sequence. With $100$ chips we can lose up to 9 times, and then bet $31$ chips. But with $140$ chips we can lose one more time , and then bet $46$ .

The first of them concerns the higher dimensions: suppose that $1,\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_d$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ (in other words, no nontrivial combination of $\alpha_i$ with rational coefficients is a rational number). Then the sequence $\{ (\alpha_i n)_{i=1}^d \mod 1 \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is equidistributed in $T^d$. The second concerns more general functions; this result is due to Weyl, I think. Suppose that $p(n) = \sum_{k=1}^r a_k n^k$ is a polynomial with $0$ constant term and at least one irrational coefficient. Then, the sequence $\{ p(n) \mod 1 \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is equidistributed in $T$.

So the given hint is probably indeed useful, but I'm not sure yet how. Another thing I tried to use to obtain the solution was the given fact that $f$ is analytical. Let $f = g$. Then $f(z) = f(x+iy) = \frac{ x + iy - 1}{x+iy} = \frac{x+iy-1}{x+iy} \cdot \frac{x-iy}{x-iy} = \frac{x^2 - 2 i x y + y^2 + iy}{x^2 + y^2} = 1 + i \frac{y(1-2x)}{x^2 + y^2} $ . Now I have written $f$ in the form $ f = u + i v$, with $u,v$ being real-valued functions. So now we can use the Cauchy-Riemann Integral formulas: $ \frac{d}{dx} 1 = 0 = \frac{d}{dy} \frac{ y(1-2x) }{x^2+y^2} \implies \frac{y(1-2x)}{x^2+y^2} = c $. The other formula yields a similar result. But now what? I still have no idea how to prove that there are finitely many positive $n$ such that the aforementioned equality holds.

$$a=\frac{\omega_0^2-\omega^2}{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)^2+(\delta\omega)^2}\land b=\frac{(\delta\omega)^2}{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)^2+(\delta\omega)^2}$$ Now the general solution is
$$Ae^{z_1t}+Be^{z_2t}+a\gamma\cos\omega t + b\gamma\sin\omega t$$ Let us consider the initial conditions $x(0)=x_0, \dot x(0)=y_0$. Using the initial conditions, we get
$$A=x_0-a\gamma-B, \quad B=\frac{y_0-x_0z_1+a\gamma z_1-b\gamma\omega}{z_2-z_1}$$ Replace $\theta$ with $\omega t$, now lets write the equation as an autonomous system as such:
$$\dot x=y$$
$$\dot y=-\delta y-\omega^2_0x+\gamma\cos\theta$$
$$\dot\theta=\omega (\text{mod}\quad 2\pi)$$ WLOG we may consider $\theta(0)=0$. Then the flow is $\phi^t(x_0,y_0,0)=(x(t),y(t),\omega t)$. The section is $\Gamma^0=\{(x,y,\theta):\theta=0\}$. Finally Poincare's map is $P(x_0,y_0)=(x(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}),y(\frac{2\pi}{\omega}))$. I want to examine the stability of all periodic solutions corresponding to fixed points of Poincare's map. Finding the fixed points seems beyond me now. I need help with that. Furthermore, how could I go about finding fundamental matrixes for the respctive periodical solutions and the respective monodromy matrices? Any help would be appreciated.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
386640,Using Montel's Theorem to show locally uniform convergence of analytic functions,"Let $f_n :U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a sequence of analytic functions, where $U$ is open and connected. Suppose there exists a point $z_0 \in U$ such that for all $k \geq 0$ the sequence $f_n^{(k)}(z_0)$ converges. How would you show that then the whole sequence $f_n$ converges locally uniformly (i.e. uniformly on compact subsets of U) to an analytic function $f$?","['sequences-and-series', 'analyticity', 'complex-analysis']"
