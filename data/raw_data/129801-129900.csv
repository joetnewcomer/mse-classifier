2010673,Related Rates: Tip of a Shadow,"A man 6 feet tall walks at a rate of 5 feet per second away from a light that is 15 feet above the ground.  When he is 10 feet from the base of the light, (a) at what rate is the tip of his shadow moving? (b) at what rate is the length of his shadow changing? My Attempt Given: $a=6\ \mathbb{ft}$ ; $b'=5\ \frac{\mathbb{ft}}{\mathbb{s}}$ ; $h=15\ \mathbb{ft}$ ; $d=10\ \mathbb{ft}$ I used the triangle proportionality theorem and got my $b=4\ \mathbb{ft}$ , and then by Pythagoras Theorem I got my $c=\sqrt{52}$ .  I do not know how to show you the triangle I drew, but I drew a triangle with in a larger triangle.  I am sort of confused on what to do in the problem, and how solve both parts.   I assumed that I would have to use Pythagoras Theorem: $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$ Then take the derivative of that $$a(a')+b(b')=c(c')$$","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

2010717,How to approximate the integral $\int_{-b}^{\infty}\log(t+b)e^{-t}e^{-e^{-t}}dt$,"Suppose we have the following integral
\begin{equation}
\int_{-b}^{\infty}\log(t+b)e^{-t}e^{-e^{-t}}dt,

I'm doubting that the approximation result will be just a simple polynomial of the constant $b$. Note that the term $e^{-e^{-t}}$ converge to 1 very fast due to its double exponential structure. Then how to proceed? UPDATE:I use MATLAB to plot $f_1(b)=\int_{-b}^{\infty}\log(t+b)e^{-t}e^{-e^{-t}}dt$ and $f_2(b)=\log(b)$ in the region $b\in[0, 10]$. The observation is very interesting: they agree very well except a small constant offset...So I'm strongly doubting that this integral is approximately equal to $\log(b)+constant$!

2010734,Existence of minimal decomposition of bounded linear functional on $C_c(X)$,"In this post of Prof Tao, it shows a lemma about the decomposition of bounded linear functional and a related exercise. The content is Lemma 9 (Jordan decomposition for functions) Let $I \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})^*$ be a (real) continuous linear functional. Then there exist positive linear functions $I^+, I^- \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})^*$ such that $I = I^+ - I^-$ . Exercise 15 Show that among all possible choices for the functionals $I^+, I^-$ appearing in the above lemma, there is a unique choice which is minimal in the sense that for any other functionals $\tilde I^+, \tilde I^-$ obeying the conclusions of the lemma, one has $\tilde I^+(f) \geq I^+(f)$ and $\tilde I^-(f) \geq I^-(f)$ for all $f \in C_c(X \rightarrow \bf{R})$ . I have a question about the existence of the so-called minimal decomposition , because roughly speaking I think THE sense of ordering  between two decompositions defined in the exercise is not necessarily applicable to any two decompositions. More precisely, given any two decompositions $I=I^+_1-I^-_1=I^+_2-I^-_2$ ， the only thing we can get is that the equality $I^+_1(f)-I^+_2(f)=I^-_1(f)-I^-_2(f)$ holds for any $f\in C_c(X)$ . But this fact does not imply that $I^+_1(f)-I^+_2(f)\ge 0$ ( $\le 0$ ) for any $f\in C_c(X)$ . It can take positive or negative values for different $f$ . It is required only that $I^+_1-I^+_2$ and $I^-_1-I^-_2$ are the same general linear functional. Then we can't say which decomposition is greater or less than which, right ? In my opinion, this ordering is a partial order among all possible decompositions. Right ? (I know the uniqueness part is easy to prove if two minimal decompositions exist, because the difference of two minimal positive functionals must be $0$ . Then they must be equal.)","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2010878,If in all subsets of size k there exist at least one pair of elements in a relation...,"I’ve recently got stuck on a theorem that seems to be true, but I am not sure if I am able to prove it: $\large\forall_{x\in\mathbb{P}_k(\mathbb{N})}\exists_{\left\{ y_1,y_2\right\}\subset x \land y_1 \neq y_2}\; \varphi(y_1,y_2) \rightarrow \exists_{x\in \mathbb{P}_k(\mathbb{N})}\forall_{\left\{y_1,y_2\right\} \subset x \land y_1 \neq y_2}\;\varphi(y_1,y_2)$ Where $\varphi$ is any symmetric predicate, i.e. $\varphi(y_1,y_2) \iff \varphi(y_2,y_1)$, and $\mathbb{P}_k(\mathbb{X})$ is the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{X}$ of size $k$. In simple words: for any symmetric relation on $\mathbb{N}$, if every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ of size k contains at least one pair of related elements, then in some subset of size k all pairs of elements are related. This statement is true for $k = 2$ and for $k = 3$ and while $k = 2$ is easy, $k = 3$ was proved by me using graphs (already a bit harder). I believe the proper method for such a theorem would be a proof by induction, however I can’t make the inductive step. Any thoughts? I really appreciate any help or hint. I also believe this to be quite an interesting theorem. EDIT: My proof was like this: I proved it by deducing without loss of generality how the graph of these relations would behave. I used for this 4 pairs of vertices (each pair having an edge between them, no other edges at the beginning). These edges are given, if by any deductive reasoning we obtain a triangle, then the theorem is proved. Each step of the proof consists of selecting 3 vertices that aren’t connected by any edge and choosing 2 of them and connecting them (in case you can’t do it without the loss of generality, you have to follow all possible routes). At each step you avoid at all cost creating a triangle. I was eventually forced to connect two vertices and by it created a triangle. Should I present the whole proof here? If so do you recommend any tool for drawing graphs and posting it here? Proof : Ramsey’s theorem may be easily used to prove this statement.

2010948,What is the intuition behind the terminology surrounding Baire's Theorem?,"Baire's theorem is considered fundamental for functional analysis. It could be simply stated as In complete metric spaces (e.g.) countable intersections of dense open
  sets are dense. But in many textbooks, there is instead a definition of what it means for a set to be of first category (meager), of second category, or residual (comeager). Then a Baire space is defined as a space in which every residual set is dense, and Baire's theorem becomes ""complete metric spaces are Baire spaces"". The terms ""first category"", ""second category"", etc. are not needed for the statement of Baire's theorem, nor do they provide any intuition for it.

So how can we possibly justify writing $$\dfrac{d}{dx}=\dfrac{dy}{dx}\dfrac{d}{dy}?$$ One of the answers to the previous question mentioned that if $$\frac{du}{dx}=\frac{du}{dy}\sqrt{\frac{m\,\omega_0}{\hbar}}$$ then just looking at  the operator $\frac{d}{dx}$ without explicitly addressing the function $u$ the operator is to apply:
  \begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}&=\sqrt{\frac{m\,\omega_0}{\hbar}}\frac{d}{dy}
\end{align*} In one of the comments given to the other answer to the previous question states that I find it easier to look at what is $\dfrac{du}{dx}$ is in terms of $y$ this means working out the derivative of $u(y(x))$ to do this you use the chain rule - so we have
  $$\frac{du}{dx} =\frac{dy}{dx}\frac{du}{dy}$$
  so looking at the operator part I.e ""ignore"" the $u$. This is how my physicist brain computes changes of variables. But I am finding it hard to accept that we simply ""ignore"" the $u$.
I realize that we cannot simply cancel out the $u$ since we are not guaranteed that $u\ne 0$.

Prove that $\{f_n\cdot g\}\to f\cdot g$ in measure. $\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}$ Proof. Since $g$ is finite a.e. on $E$, $m(\bigcap_{n\in\N}\{x\in E\,\,|\,\,g(x)>n\})=0\implies \forall\epsilon>0\,\,\, \exists N_1\in\N$:$n\geq N_1 \implies m\{x\in E\,\,|\,\,|g(x)|>n\}<\epsilon$.

Since $\{f_n\}\to f$ in measure on $E$, $\exists N\in\N :n\geq N\implies m\{x\in E\,\,|\,\,|f_n(x)-f(x)|>\frac{\eta}{2M}\}<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Letting $n\geq N$, notice that:

This is a problem that arose while I was studying some properties of boolean circuits (this is just for the anecdote, it should not matter here). I hope it's neither an entirely trivial question (as I've been unable to solve it myself) nor a too hard one. Let $(n,k)$ be two integers, with $k \ll n$ (in the particular case I'm interested in, $n$ is a power of $2$ and $k = \log_2{n}$ ). Suppose that we are given $n$ subsets of $[n] = \{1, \cdots, n\}$ , denoted $(S_1, \cdots, S_n)$ , such that: $\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i = [n]$ For $i=1$ to $n$ , $|S_i| \leq k$ (where $|\cdot|$ denotes the size of the set) Is it possible to find $m \in O(n/k)$ subsets $(S'_1, \cdots, S'_m)$ of $[n]$ such that: For $i=1$ to $m$ , there is $J \subseteq [n]$ such that $S'_i= \bigcup_{j \in J} S_j$ $\bigcup_{i=1}^m S'_i = [n]$ For $i=1$ to $m$ , $|S'_i| \in O(k)$ In other (intuitive) words, I have ""too many subsets"" ( $n$ ), each subset being ""small"" (less than $k$ elements), which entirely cover $[n]$ . Can I ""regroup"" them, using unions, into a smaller number ( $m \in O(n/k)$ ) of subsets so that each new subset remains ""not too big"" ( $O(k)$ ), but still the new subsets entirely cover $[n]$ ? I've failed to get even a good intuition of the result I should expect. Although I've made my best to formulate it as a well-defined question, I'm in fact interested about whatever interesting can be said about it, especially in the setting $k = \log_2{n}$ . If, for example, the answer is no and some counter example is found, then I'd be interested in knowing whether there is some natural characterization of the sets $S_i$ for which sets $S'_i$ satisfying the above conditions can be found, or if one can get a yes answer by relaxing some bound (like, $m \in O((n\log\log n)/k)$ , or $|S'_i| \in O(k\log k)$ ). More generally, if the question appears to be non-trivial, I'd be satisfied by an answer providing interesting insights even if it does not fully answer the question. Even relevant references would definitely help. EDIT: The problem shares many similarities with the set cover problem and the maximum coverage problem . However, these problems are concerned with the optimality of the solution, while I'm only asking for the existence of some (possibly non-optimal) solution that satisfy the given constraints. I'm currently trying to get some intuition of the result by looking at whether uniformly random subsets of $[n]$ of size $k$ would satisfy (with some reasonable probability) the constraints.",['combinatorics']

$$P(d(P^n, Q^n) > \alpha) \leq \alpha^{-1}E_P(d(P^n, Q^n)).$$ Now, the claim would follow if I could show that $d(P^n, Q^n)< \alpha \beta$ a.s. ($P$), but the best I can do is use the triangle inequality to get $$d(P^n, Q^n) \leq d(P^n,P) + d(Q^n, Q) + d(P,Q) < 2 + \alpha \beta.$$ Then $P(d(P^n, Q^n) > \alpha) < 2/\alpha + \beta$. I'm stuck trying to improve this. Addendum. On second thought, the above estimate doesn't improve the trivial estimate $P(d(P^n, Q^n) > \alpha) \leq 1$ for small $\alpha$, so probably a different approach is needed. Perhaps we can show that $d(P^n, Q^n) < d(P,Q)$ a.s. (P), but I don't see how to do it yet. Hints are appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"

It partitions the vertices into equivalency classes. Composition of automorphisms from A1 (closure) generates all permutations, that mix elements only within these equivalency classes. Such automorphisms can be represented as a table, which attaches the equivalency class to each vertex (""in linear memory""). E.g.

Is there any analogy of R for A2, or even an equivalence relation? Would it be possible to represent such automoprhisms efficiently (maybe within quadratic memory)? Do these types of automorphisms already have names in Math? P.S. What is my goal : I am making a computer program. The input will be an oriented graph and k-tuples of vertices of the graph, like

&= \dfrac{n}{x}(f(x))-(a_1x^{n-2}+a_2x^{n-3}+\ldots+na_{n-1})-\dfrac{na_n}{x}
\end{aligned}$$ I was thinking that if I could prove that the no of distinct roots of $f'(x)$ are less than $\left \lfloor{\dfrac{n}{2}}\right\rfloor$, then all the roots of $f(x)=0$ are not real. But I couldn't figure out how to manipulate $f'(x)$ so as to arrive at the condition that the question asks to prove or for that matter how to prove that the no. of roots of $f'(x)$ are less than $\left \lfloor{\dfrac{n}{2}}\right\rfloor$. Attempt 2:- I thought that why not start messing around with the expression that we are needed to prove $\lt0$, i.e. $(n-1){a_1}^{2}-2na_2$. $a_1=-\sum{\alpha} \qquad\qquad a_2=\sum{\alpha\beta}$ So, $$(n-1){a_1}^{2}-2na_2=(n-1)\left(\sum\alpha\right)^2-2n\left(\sum{\alpha\beta}\right)=n\sum{\alpha^2}-\left(\sum{\alpha}\right)^2$$ I don't know how to arrive at the required condition from the point that I reached in this attempt. Can you push me in the right direction by giving a hint as to what should be my line of thought while attempting the problem","['algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'polynomials']"
2013365,Projection Lemma for Hilbert C-star modules,"The projection lemma (for example, Rudin's functional analysis book theorem 12.4) says that if $M$ is a closed vector subspace of a $\mathbb{C}$-Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ then $$\mathcal{H}=M\oplus M^{\perp}$$This lemma is a crucial ingredient in the proof of the Riesz representation theorem (stating that $\mathcal{H}\cong\mathcal{H}^{\ast}$), namely, in order to show surjectivity of the map $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}^{\ast}$. For Hilbert C-star modules (for example defined in Blackadar) the Riesz representation theorem does not hold. If so far what I wrote is correct, I was wondering exactly how the projection lemma fails for that case? Let $\mathscr{E}$ be an $A$-right-Hilbert module, where $A$ is a separable C-star algebra. Let $\mathscr{F}\subseteq\mathscr{E}$ be a closed (in the topology induced by the inner product) $A$-submodule. We would have liked to show that $$ \mathscr{E}=\mathscr{F}\oplus \mathscr{F}^{\perp} $$ and our goal is to see exactly why this fails for Hilbert $A$-modules.","['functional-analysis', 'hilbert-modules', 'hilbert-spaces', 'noncommutative-geometry']"
2013401,Category Theory -- limits commute with kernels,"This is Exercise 1.6.I from Vakil's notes on Algebraic Geometry . Suppose $\mathscr{C}$ is an abelian category and $a: \mathscr{I}\rightarrow \mathscr{C}, b: \mathscr{I}\rightarrow \mathscr{C}$ are two diagrams in $\mathscr{C}$ indexed by $\mathscr{I}$. Let $A_i=a(i)$ and $B_i=b(i)$ be two objects in those diagrams. Let $h_{i}: A_{i}\rightarrow B_{i}$ be maps commuting with the maps in the diagram, i.e., $h_{i}$ is a natural transformation of functors $a\rightarrow b$. Then the $\ker h_i$ form another diagram in $\mathscr{C}$ indexed by $\mathscr{F}$. Describe a canonical isomorphism $\varprojlim \ker h_i\cong \ker (\varprojlim A_i\rightarrow \varprojlim B_i)$, assuming the limits exist. I showed the first part, which is illustrated using the following diagram. I am trying to describe the isomorphism using the following diagram: The dashed arrows are all due to the universal property. It remains to prove there exists a unique map from $\lim(\ker h_i)$ to $\ker h$ that makes the diagram commute. Then there exists a unique isomorphism between them. My question: To see that, it suffices to show that the map $\lim(\ker h_i)\rightarrow \lim A_i\rightarrow \lim B_i$ is zero. I am not sure how to. Is the following argument correct? And it is zero since it is the unique map such that the square $\lim(\ker h_i)\rightarrow \ker h_i\rightarrow B_i$ and $\lim(\ker h_i)\rightarrow \lim A_i\rightarrow \lim B_i\rightarrow B_i$ commutes. The commutativity follows from Exercise 1.3.Q. Since one side is obviously zero, the unique map makes the other side zero must be zero.

2013474,Counting the number of maximal chains in a poset,"Let $X = \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ . Consider a poset $(X,|)$ , where $|$ is the division relation. Count the maximal chains of $(X,|)$ A maximal chain is such a chain $C\subset X$ that for every $x\in X\setminus C$ , $C\cup\{x\}$ is no longer a chain. For instance, $\{1,p\}, p\in\mathbb{P}$ would be a maximal chain if $p<n$ and $2p>n$ . So, one way to generate maximal chains is to consider $\{p\in\mathbb{P} : p\leq n\} =:P$ . Fix $p\in P$ and construct chains as follows: $$C =\{p^k : p^k\leq n,k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\}$$ but this won't obviously exhaust the list of possibilities. It may not even generate a maximum chain. A more accurate way could be constructing them as follows: For instance, for $\{\{1,2,\ldots , 12\},|\}$ we can have $\{1,2,4,8\}$ or $\{1,3,6,12\}$ or $\{1,2,4,12\}$ . The common theme is that each chain contains a maximal element. Posing a sub-problem that would perhaps help: Given $X = \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ and $m\in X$ . What is the maximum length (number of elements) of the chain $\{1,\ldots , m\}$ w.r.t relation $|$ ? or equivalently, how many divisors of $m$ are there that are pairwise comparable w.r.t $|$ ? But now we need to know all the maximal elements of $X$ , what ever a maximal element exactly even is. Furthermore, a maximal element doesn't necessarily generate a unique maximal chain. I need help/hints on how to bring this cacophony to a cohesive harmonious conclusion.","['combinatorics', 'extremal-combinatorics']"
2013483,Prove that any two nontrivial subgroups of $\mathbb{Q}$ have nontrivial intersection,"I need to prove that any two nontrivial subgroups of $\mathbb{Q}$ have a nontrivial intersection as part of a larger proof that $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be represented as a nontrivial direct product. (Yes, I realize that there are other ways to prove that $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be represented as a nontrivial direct product, but I am not interested in those, and will not accept answers showing me how to do that). Based on the density of the rationals, I guess this idea kind of makes sense, but I am doing this proof for an abstract algebra class, and I don't think real analysis proofs would be accepted. Everywhere I've looked online has said this is ""trivial"" or ""easy to see"" without bothering to actually prove it for those of us mere mortals who don't see it as such. As for myself, I have literally no idea where to even get started proving this. Could somebody help me figure this out (without giving me cutesy examples that aren't really all that related with the expectation that I should be able to figure it out from looking at those - that's not really how my brain works)?

2013492,Scheme-theoretic proof of a correspondence between multiple tangents on a plane curve and ordinary $r$-fold points on the dual curve?,"Let $X$ be a curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0.$ We say that a line of $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ is a multiple tangent of $X$ if it is tangent to $X$ at more than one point. If $L$ is a multiple tangent of $X,$ tangent to $X$ at the points $P_1, \ldots, P_r$ and if none of the $P_i$ is an inflection point, show that the corresponding point of the dual curve $X^*$ is an ordinary $r$-fold point, meaning that it is a point of multiplicity $r$ with distinct tangent directions. This is obvious from a geometric point-of-view, but I would like to give a rigorous proof of this fact, using say some scheme-theory. I would be grateful for explanations on how to prove this, or references. Update 22 nov: So, I see how one can do this if one assumes the (non-obvious) fact that the map $X \rightarrow X^*$ is the normalization of $X^*.$ To prove this one needs to show that the Gauss map $X \rightarrow X^*$ is birational, and I can prove that this is the case if I know that there are finitely many multiple tangents. So I'm back at step one. I think the above should have an elementary proof since it is in Hartshorne, but I can't seem to find the right approach. Update 23 nov: So I received an answer, but this is not the sort of answer I was after (I don't think it is rigorous either). Let me sketch the proof I had in mind if I knew that the Gauss map was birational. If so, we could identify $X \rightarrow X^*$ with the normalization, and if so, we can identify $X$ with blowing-up at singular points of $X^*.$  Then saying that the blow-up of $X^*$ along $L$ gives $r$ points such that the induced map on tangent spaces is injective is precisely the fact that $L$ is an ordinary $r$-fold point. This is a purely algebraic proof in some sense, and doesn't use the analytic category. Update 24 nov: The previous answer I received was deleted and then replaced with basically the same answer, but changed some small details. This is still not the sort of proof I have in mind, so let me be extra clear. I would want a purely algebraic proof of the fact that multiple tangents of $X$ corresponds to ordinary $r$-fold points. Preferably, I would want a proof that would not pass to the analytic category and not use the full strength of the biduality theorem. The reason I think the biduality theorem should not be used is that Hartshorne never mentions it, so I would suspect he had something other in mind. If it is possible, I would also want an answer that works in arbitrary characteristic. So, the answer I have received is not what I was after.",['algebraic-geometry']
