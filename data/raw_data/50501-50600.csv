518390,"Infinitely many moons, or one ring to bring them all, a limit to bind it?","The Kanagy clan makes its home on a distant planet of mass $M_p$ with $k$ moons. Suppose the moons are identical with mass $m$. Furthermore, these moons share a common circular orbit on an orbital plane. The circular orbits are at distance $L$ from the center of the planet and the moons are evenly spaced. What is the speed $v(k)$ of the lunar orbits for a fixed, but finite, value of $k$? Suppose we hold $km=M_m$ fixed as $k \rightarrow \infty$, what is the limiting value of $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}v(k)$ in this context? My ideal solution to this problem addresses $(1.)$ by vector analysis paired with the equation of motion for constant speed circular motion. Often cases $k=2$ or $k=3$ are given as homework problems in first semester university physics. I've found an expression for this in a previous attempt, but I'd rather not include it here for fear of biasing the reader. Next, the solution continues to $(2.)$, when I attempted to compute the limit directly it was rather involved. However, by intuition, I know the answer should easily derive from Newton's Law of Gravitation as follows:
$$ \frac{M_mv^2}{L}= \frac{GM_mM_p}{L^2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad v = \sqrt{\frac{GM_p}{L}} $$ Given the preceding discussion, show show $v(k) \rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{GM_p}{L}}$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. Alternatively, prove my intuition is incorrect. Incidentally, I gave this as a bonus problem on a final exam in my university physics course. I had a student pretty well solve $(1.)$, but $(2.)$ I've not yet cracked. It is assumed that classical mechanics applies to this problem and any relativistic effects may be neglected.","['analytic-geometry', 'physics', 'limits']"
518430,How prove this $\lim_{x\to+\infty}(f'(x)+f(x))=l$,"let $f(x)$ is continous and $f'(x)$ is continous  on $[0,\infty)$,show that $$\lim_{x\to+\infty}(f'(x)+f(x))=l$$
  if and only if: $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=l$ and $f'(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,+\infty)$. How prove this it? Thank you. I can prove this if $$\lim_{x\to+\infty}(f'(x)+f(x))=l$$
  then we have  $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=l$ My Part of the
Solution : without loss of we let $l=0$,Give $\epsilon>0$,let $a>0$ be such that $|f(x)+f'(x)|<\epsilon$ for $x\ge a$ Then by the generalized mean value theorem there is $\xi\in (a,x)$ such that
$$\dfrac{e^x f(x)-e^af(a)}{e^x-e^a}=f(\xi)+f'(\xi)$$
Thus
$$|f(x)-f(a)e^{a-x}|<\epsilon|1-e^{a-x}|$$
so
$$|f(x)|<|f(a)|e^{a-x}+\epsilon|1-e^{a-x}|$$
so
$$|f(x)|<2\epsilon$$ for sufficiently large $x$. But How can prove $f'(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,+\infty)$ and other question: How prove if$\displaystyle\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=l$ and $f'(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,+\infty)$ then we have $$\lim_{x\to+\infty}(f'(x)+f(x))=l$$","['limits', 'continuity', 'analysis']"

518463,Extended integral over parabola open set,"Let $f(x,y)=1/(y+1)^2$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$. Let $A$ be the open set $$A=\{(x,y)\mid x>0, x^2<y<2x^2\}.$$ Show that $\int_A f$ exists, and calculate it. Since $A$ is an unbounded open set, we have to use the ""extended integral"", which has two equivalent definitions. 1) $\int_A f$ is the supremum of the numbers $\int_D f$, as $D$ ranges over all compact Jordan-measurable subsets of $A$. 2) If $C_1,C_2,\ldots$ is a sequence of compact Jordan-measurable subsets of $A$ such that $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}C_i=A$ and $C_i$ belongs to the interior of $C_{i+1}$ for all $i$ . Then $\int_A f=\lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}\int_{C_i}f$. Definition 2) is easier to deal with. Nevertheless, for a set like the set $A$, with a really strange shape, it is really hard to imagine what compact, rectifiable subsets we should take to satisfy the conditions in 2). Also, it must be easy to calculate the integrals of $f$ over these subsets, so that we can compute the limit to be the integral of $f$ over $A$. Which subsets $C_1,C_2,\ldots$ should be chosen to satisfy the conditions in  2), so that we can calculate the integrals over them?","['improper-integrals', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

I totally get this, because $x^2$ is positive, if $x$ is negative, so $\sqrt{y}$ , whether $y = 10^2$ or $y = -10^2$ : $y$ is positive. But then I remember that $\sqrt{x}$ is the same as $x^{1/2}$ and thus, $\sqrt{x^2}$ is the same as $x^{1}$ . So, as far as I get it, $\sqrt{x^2} = x^{2/2}$ . But then, I can cancel $\frac{2}{2}$ to $1$ . So: $\sqrt{x^2} = x^1 = x$ . Where does the absolute value in this derivation of the calculation come from? I get it why its there: Because $(-x)^2 = x^2$ , so the radicand is always positive. But from $\sqrt{x^n} = x^{n/2}$ I dont understand how it gets there.","['radicals', 'arithmetic', 'absolute-value', 'algebra-precalculus']"
518529,Pullback of maximal ideal in $k[y]$ is not maximal in $k[x]$.,"Let $k$ be a field and let $k[x]=k[x_1,\ldots,k_m]$ and $k[y]=k[y_1,\ldots,y_n]$ be $k$-algebras. Let $\varphi:k[x]\to k[y]$ be a $k$-algebra homomorphism. It can be shown (pretty readily) that $\varphi$ is determined by polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_m\in k[y]$ which tell us where to send the $x_i$. In the case where $k$ is algebraically closed, as Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the associated algebraic geometry thereabouts, the pullback of every maximal ideal in $k[y]$ is maximal in $k[x]$. However, if $k$ is not algebraically closed, then there should be a counterexample, i.e. some maximal ideal in $k[y]$ that does not pull back maximally along $\varphi$. It's pretty clear that the case of $k[x]=k[t]=k[y]$ for one variable $t$ is not very fruitful, so I've been trying to come up with an example in $\mathbb R[x,y]\to\mathbb R[x,y]$ using $(x^2+1,y)$ or some other ideal. Also suggested online (in weird contexts) was the ideal $(x^2+y^2+1)$, but I can't see how that's going to help. In theory I'd like $\mathbb R[x,y]/\mathfrak m\cong\mathbb C$ to pull back to $\mathbb R[x,y]/\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak m)\cong\mathbb R[t]$, but I've been unable to succeed. Thanks for the read. PS: this is a homework question, and in theory the answer could be 'the pullback is always maximal', but I don't think so.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

518594,What's the idea behind the covariant derivative?,"I'm learning differential geometry from what I find on the Internet (to eventually find a grasp on General Relativity too). Right now I playing with a sphere. I have 3 functions ($x$, $y$, $z$) that take 2 parameters (latitude and longitude). I denoted it with $\mathbf{y}(\mathbf{x})$. Then I defined a path $\mathbf{x}(t)$ on this sphere. If I differentiate $\mathbf y$ with respect to $t$ once I get a tangent vector. If I differentiate it again, I usually get a vector that's not tangent (so if I walking on a great circle on my sphere, the second derivative, the acceleration, points towards the center of the sphere). At this point I thought that an inhabitant on this 2D manifold cannot feel accelerations pointing towards the extra-dimensions, only the projections of it. 
So I projected these vectors into the tangent space and I got this: $$
\frac{d^2 x^i}{dt^2} + \Gamma^i_{jk} \frac{d x^j}{dt} \frac{dx^k}{dt}
$$ For latitude circles it's a vector pointing north (on the northern hemisphere).- It makes sense to me, as latitude circles keeps turning northward. But still not sure what I actually did here. So is this what I did called the covariant derivation (differentiation as usual then projecting the resulting vector into the tangent space)? What else can I use covariant derivation for?

518609,When does the limit of a sum become an integral?,"In many maths and physics texts and courses, I've been told in many cases that the limit of a sum becomes an integral, i.e. (very roughly): $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{x=0}^n f(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx$$ However I know that this equation can't be true in every case, otherwise series would not exist. So I'd like to ask: what characteristics does $f(x)$ have for the above equation to be true? More details: Yesterday I had to resolve a series like this: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{x=0}^n (1 - e^{1/n}) e^{(n-x)/n}$$ This comes from a real-life problem. I decided to find the value of that limit using the following integral: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^n (1 - e^{1/n}) e^{(n-x)/n} dx$$ The reasons why I decided to go with the integral are two: habit and because I needed the sum to be continuous (meaning: every value summed must be infinitesimal). Also, I've always been told that sums are for discrete values, integrals are for continuous/infinitesimal ones. The problem is that I do not have a mathematical justification for that. And while testing shows that the result matches reality, I don't know whether it is mathematically correct, or it is just a coincidence. So I asked myself: why should my limit be an integral and not a series? I decided to calculate first the expression of $\sum_{x=0}^n (1-e^{1/n}) e^{(n-x)/n}$ (which is $1 - e^{1/n+1}$) and afterwards the limit for $n$ to infinity ($1  - e$). The result is the same of the integral, and I'm a bit surprised by that. The reason why I'm surprised can be explained looking at the picture on this answer . My sum is not an area, however it it were, I'd know for sure that what I need is the picture on the left rather than the one on the right (being a real-life problem, I know in advance the nature of the operands I'm dealing with). What's going on here? Which of the following equations is the most correct? $$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{x=0}^n (1 - e^{1/n}) e^{(n-x)/n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^n (1 - e^{1/n}) e^{(n-x)/n} dx \\

Will the man cheat more? yes.
why?
1)Since the trains come and go with same frequency, we can assume(to simplify the problem) that there is only one train that goes in circles.
2) To go home, the train has to be between (8)-9-8. And to go to mistress the train has to be between (8)-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8. But my solution works only if the number of trains is less the number of stations.

518709,Differential Forms and Vector Fields correspondence,"Barrett O'Neill's Differential Geometry book says that Classical vector analysis avoids the use of differential forms on $\mathbb{R}^3$ by converting 1-forms and 2-forms into vector fields via the following 1-1 correspondences: $$\begin{array}{*5c}\text{(1-form)} &\leftrightarrow &\text{Vector field}& \leftrightarrow& \text{(2-form)}\\

I superfically grasp the first correspondence although the motivation behind that escapes me as I have always thought of a 1-form as the dual of a vector field in that at each point of the manifold; the form associates a linear functional on a tangent vector at that point while the Vector field actually gives the tangent vector. As for the second one , I am still not able to visualise 2-forms as anything but functionals on a pair of tangent vectors and the correspondence is unnatural. O'Neill uses this to frame the Curl and Gradient and Divergence definitions in the language of forms.

That is, if $X$ is normal and $Y \rightarrow X$ is a birational morphism from a nonsingular variety, is it true that $h^{0,q}(X)=h^{0,q}(Y)$? This is true for $X$ nonsingular, but the proof I know uses the symmetry from Question 1. I think there is a proof via the composite functor spectral sequence if $X$ has rational singularities (although I  didn't check carefully). Again, I don't see a reason it should be true in general, but I don't know a counterexample.",['algebraic-geometry']

518766,Upper Bound for Operator Norm in Marcinkiewicz Interpolation Theorem,"Exercise 1.3.3(c) Let $0<p_0<p<p_1<\infty$ and let $T$ be an operator as in Theorem 1.3.2($\|T(f)\|_{L^{p_0,\infty}(Y)}\leq A_0\|f\|_{L^{p_0}(X)}$ for all $f\in L^{p_0}(X)$ and $\|T(f)\|_{L^{p_1,\infty}(Y)}\leq A_1\|f\|_{L^{p_1}(X)}$ for all $f\in L^{p_1}(X)$) that also satisfies $|T(f)|\leq T(|f|)$, for all $f\in L^{p_0}+L^{p_1}$. (c) When $0<p_0<p_1<\infty$, then the norm of $T$ from $L^p$ to $L^p$ is at most \[\min_{0<\lambda<1}p^{\frac{1}{p}}\left(\frac{B(p-p_0,p_0+1)}{(1-\lambda)^{p_0}}+\frac{\frac{p_1-p+1}{p_1-p}}{\lambda^{p_1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}A_0^{\frac{1/p-1/p_1}{1/p_0-1/p_1}}A_1^{\frac{1/p_0-1/p}{1/p_0-1/p_1}}\] where $B(s,t)$ is the Beta function.
[Hint: When $p_1<\infty$ write $f=f_0+f_1$, where $f_0=f-\delta\alpha$ when $f\geq\delta\alpha$ and zero otherwise. Use that $|\{|T(f)|>\alpha\}|\leq|\{|T(f_0)|>(1-\lambda)\alpha\}|+|\{|T(f_1)|>\lambda\alpha\}|$ and optimize over $\delta>0$.] MY ATTEMPT: 
From the hint, $f_0=\max(f-\delta\alpha,0)$ and $f_1=\min(f,\delta\alpha)$. We have
\begin{align*}
& d_{T(f)}(\alpha)\leq d_{T(f_0)}((1-\lambda)\alpha)+d_{T(f_1)}(\lambda\alpha)\\
\leq&\left(\frac{A_0}{(1-\lambda)\alpha}\right)^{p_0}\|f_0\|_{L^{p_0}}^{p_0}+\left(\frac{A_1}{\lambda\alpha}\right)^{p_1}\|f_1\|_{L^{p_1}}^{p_1}\\

\end{align*}
Hence,
\begin{align*}
&\|T(f)\|_{L^p}^p=\int_0^\infty p\alpha^{p-1}d_{T(f)}(\alpha)d\alpha\\

519986,topology homework,"I'm new to topology, and therefore not very good at it yet. I have following questions, that I have ansewer, please help me verify what is not correct and what is missing in my answers. Let $X$ be a set and $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ a function. Define 
$$d: X\times X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\quad d(x,y)=|f(x)-f(y)|$$
State which properties $f$ must fulfill in order to $d$ be a metric, and prove that they are necessary and sufficient. my answer: $f$ must fulfil M1:
$$d(f(x),f(y))=|f(x)-f(y)|=0\iff f(x)=f(y)$$
$$|f(x)-f(y)|=0\Rightarrow f(x)-f(y)=0\iff f(x)=f(y)$$
and the other way around 
$$f(x)=f(y)\Rightarrow d(f(x),f(y))=|f(x)-f(y)|=|0|=0$$ M2:
$$d(f(x),f(y))=|f(x)-f(y)|=|-(f(y)-f(x))|=|f(y)-f(x)|=d(f(y),f(x))$$ M3:
$$d(x,y)≤d(x,z)+d(z,y)$$
$$d(f(x),f(y))=|f(x)-f(y)|=|f(x)-f(z)+f(z)-f(y)|≤|f(x)-f(z)|+|f(z)-f(y)|=d(f(x),f(z))+d(f(z),f(y))$$ Prove that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_0=1$, $a_{n+1}=1+1/a_n$   for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is convergent in $\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean metric, and determine afterwards its limit. Can you interpret the limit geometrically? my answer: $$d(x_{n+1},x_n )≤1/2\quad d(x_n,x_{n-1} )\Rightarrow d(x_n,x_m )≤(1/2)^{n+m-1} d(x_1,x_0 )$$ We know that $(1/2)^{n+m-1}$ goes against 0, so $d(x_n,x_m )$ goes against 0 too, therefore we have to find the limit.
If exact converge will $a_n\rightarrow a, a_{n+1}\rightarrow a$ goes against same number: $$a=1+1/a$$
$$a=(√5+1)/2  og-(√5-1)/2$$ Prove that $S\subset\mathbb {R}$ it holds inf(S) = -sup(-S), where $-S=\{-s:s\in S\}$. My answer: We know $inf⁡(S)≤s$ for all $s$. Therefore $-inf⁡(S)≥s$. In other words, $-inf⁡(S)$ is an upper bound for $–S$. Hence, $sup⁡(-S)≤-inf⁡(S)⟹inf⁡(S)≤-sup⁡(-S)$. This is half of the problem. But with this in mind, you can figure out the other direction. In other words you want to show $inf⁡(S)≥-sup⁡(-S)$. So you can say that since $-S$ is bounded above, then $-s≤sup⁡(-S)⟹s ≥-sup⁡(-S)$. Therefore, $-sup⁡(-S)$ is a lower bound for $S$ which implies $inf⁡(S)≥-sup⁡(-S)$.
Finally $inf⁡(S)≤-sup⁡(-S)$ and $inf⁡(S)≥-sup⁡(-S)$ implies 
$inf⁡(S)=-sup⁡(-S).$","['general-topology', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'metric-spaces']"
519989,Continuous mapping on unit ball such that $T(\Bbb x_0)=0$,"got a question from a course in functional analysis. ""  Let $T:\{\Bbb x\in\Bbb R: ||\Bbb x||\leq 1\}\to\Bbb R^n$ be a continuous mapping. Moreover assume that $\langle T(\Bbb x),\Bbb x\rangle>0$ for all $\Bbb x$ with $||\Bbb x||=1$. Here $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the standard inner product on $\Bbb R^n$ with the induced norm $||\cdot||$. Prove$^1$ that there exists a $\Bbb x_0\in\{\Bbb x\in\Bbb R: ||\Bbb x||\leq 1\}$ such that $T(\Bbb x_0)=0$. $^1$Hint: Consider the mapping $G(\Bbb x)=\Bbb x - \epsilon T(\Bbb x)$ for some properly choosen $\epsilon>0$          "" From that hint it is very tempting to assume that what you should do is to show that $G(\Bbb x)$ has a fixed point in the unit ball. To do so I'd call for Brouwer's fixed point theorem, which states that any continuous function from a convex compact subset of $\Bbb R^n$ to itself has a fixed point. If everything is correct so far, I need to show that '  $\Bbb x - \epsilon T(\Bbb x)$  ' is compact and convex. To show that it is compact, I should show that it is bounded and closed, and then, boundedness implies that it is also convex. But now the first real problem appears (If everything is right so far); How can I show that it is bounded? In particular, that it is bounded such that $||G(\Bbb x)||\leq1$
, or that $G(\Bbb x)\in\{\Bbb x\in\Bbb R: ||\Bbb x||\leq 1\}$.","['fixed-point-theorems', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
