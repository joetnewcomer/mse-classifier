1347164,"Why is $\max(x, x')$ equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}( x + x' + |x - x' |)$?","Why is it that $$\max(x, x') = \frac{1}{2}( x + x' + |x - x'|)$$ is true? Is it supposed to be obvious? Because it seems to come out of thin air for me. Anyway, I've verified this by plotting it in matlab, so it works, but its hardly a satisfying proof/justification. I've actually have been shown a proof but I am unable to internalize and understand it properly. I will provide it below: $$\begin{align*}
\max(x, x') &= \max\left(x - \frac{1}{2}(x + x'),\; x' - \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\right) + \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\\\\
&=\max\left(\frac{1}{2}(x - x'), \frac{1}{2}(x' - x)\right) + \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\\\\
&=\max\left(\frac{1}{2}(x' - x), \frac{1}{2}(x - x')\right) + \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\\\\
&=\max\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - x'), \frac{1}{2}(x - x')\right) + \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\\\\
&=\left| \frac{1}{2}(x - x')\right| + \frac{1}{2}(x + x') \\\\
&= \frac{1}{2}( x + x' + |x -x'| )
\end{align*}$$ The only line that remains a mystery for me is actually the first line. $$ \max(x, x') = \max\left(x - \frac{1}{2}(x + x'),\; x' - \frac{1}{2}(x + x')\right) + \frac{1}{2}(x + x') $$ After that everything seems to be simple algebra manipulations, except for the cool use of the identity
$$\left| \frac{1}{2}(x - x')\right| = \max\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - x'), \frac{1}{2}(x - x')\right)$$ which makes sense to me. If anyone has a good explanation of why that step is true, I'd be very thankful. Also, and maybe more importantly, that first step seems like magic to me, I have no idea where it came from and if someone has a good explanation for that too, that would be awesome. I'd like to understand this not only to see why its correct, but also to understand how one would have come up with such a result.","['absolute-value', 'real-analysis', 'functions']"
1347169,"German Tank Problem, Confidence Level","Suppose you're in a city with n cabs. Each cab has a distinctive number from 0 to n. You take a cab 10 times, the choice of the cabs is independent and equiprobable. The cab with the biggest number has number 100. Determine a preferably small upper limit for n with a confidence level of $\frac{9}{10}$. To me, this sounds like the German Tank Problem.

1347171,Proving that the intersection of two closed sets is closed in a matroid,"I am stuck on a little homework problem I have. Here, $M$ is a matroid with rank function $R$.

My approach thus far is to take $((A \cap B ) \cup e))$ and stick it into the semimodular law for the rank function, aiming to show that $R((A \cap B ) \cup e)) > R(A \cap B)$ for $e \notin A \cap B$, but nothing of value seems to come out.

I failed to bookmark it well enough that I can readily retrieve it, so I’m asking the community’s help. What reminded me of this result was this question on MO about famous vacuously true statements . Obviously, one of the cases in the proof is vacuous and, since it involves the Riemann Hypothesis, conceivably qualifies as being famous.","['logic', 'reference-request', 'complex-analysis']"

While studying, I found a formula that found the number of ways to select k non-consecutive elements from n consecutive terms, not necessarily the first n consecutive terms, but any n consecutive terms. 
The formula was:   Number of Ways = (n-k+1) C (k)

1347287,Surface area of platonic solids inscribed in unit sphere.,"If one inscribed each of the platonic solids in the unit sphere, what can be said about the surface areas? Is it a monotonic sequence? Does any ""meaningful"" (see paragraph below) continuous (or discrete) function $f(n)$, n the number of faces, outputting the inscribed area exist? By ""meaningful"", I mean not just curve-fitting, but something that is significant for values of n other than 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20, even though there are no platonic solids for these other values of n. The most obvious thing in this category is that $f(n) \rightarrow 4\pi$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. I'm not sure exactly $\textbf{how}$ this significance would occur. I guess I'm wondering if you could discover other patterns that exist. Starting places might be properties involving n even or odd, prime, a Fermat number, or perhaps having the inscribable solid be as close as possible to regular (whatever that means), non-convex, etc.?

1347294,Condition for Continuity (two variable),"I came across the following question while studying for quals.  This one is from a previous qualifier.  I have a few ideas (which I'll mention below), but am stuck on how to complete the problem.  Any help or guidance you may be able to offer would be very much appreciated.  Here is the question as it appears on the qual: Define:

  f(x,y) =

    {\Large\frac{|x|^m|y|^n}{|x|^p+|y|^q}},\; (x,y) \neq (0,0) \\ 
    \quad\quad 0,\;\quad\quad (x,y) = (0,0)
  \end{cases}
  \quad\text{where } m, n, p, q >0
$$ Find some necessary conditions on $m,n,p,q$ such that $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(0,0)$; find some sufficient conditions on $m,n,p,q$ such that $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. Find a necessary and sufficient condition on $m,n,p,q$ such that $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(0,0)$. My thoughts on this problem were to break it up into cases.  At first, I played around with $m,n,p,q$ only being in $\mathbb{N}$, hoping this would provide me with some insight. I think I can say that if $m,n,p,q$ are all equal, that should work, as it should if either $m\geq p$ or $n\geq q$, or both.  This seems to work even for fractional values.  I feel like there is much more I am missing.
On the other hand, if I can find conditions on $m,n,p,q$ such that $f$ becomes differentiable, then that should also force $f$ to be continuous. Without forcing differentiability, I am guessing there will be many cases to consider (i.e., when $x,y$ are positive, negative, etc.). I am just a bit lost on how to proceed.  I am having trouble ironing out the details.  Thank you very much for any help you can offer.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

1347328,How to scale a 2D vector and keep direction,"I want to take any vector in R2 and scale its length to 1 while keeping the original direction (ratio of x component to y). As an example of my goal, let's say I have the vector (1,1), it would become $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ . The vector (0,5) would become (0,1). You can see how the answer is not so apparent if the original vector is something like (0.98, 2.6). I hope for a function that can solve this for me but the best I've been able to do is convert the vector into an angle and then calculate dimensions using trig and the unit circle.

1347337,Transitive Closure of a Well-Founded Relation is Well-Founded (without Axiom of Choice),"I am interested in proving the titular claim: Transitive Closure of a Well-Founded Relation is Well-Founded (without Axiom of Choice) My approach: Let $R$ be a well-founded relation. We construct the transitive closure $R^t$ as the union of the range of $F:\mathbb{N}\to \mathrm{fld}(R)\times\mathrm{fld}(R)$ defined (inductively) by
$$ F(0)=R\qquad\text{and}\qquad F(n+1)=F(n)\circ R $$
for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
That is to say, $R^t\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\bigcup\mathrm{ran}(F)=\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty F(i)$... My thought process: I can show that for each natural number $n$, $\bigcup_{i=0}^nF(i)$ is well-founded given that $R$ is well-founded (by induction on $n$), but that doesn't imply that $R^t$ is well-founded. It seems I need some sort of ""transfinite induction"" argument where if all the ""finite"" predecessors $\bigcup_{i=0}^nF(i)$ are well-founded, then $\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty F(i)$ is well-founded (but I don't think we necessarily have a well-ordered set to make such an argument). Any hints/advice is much appreciated!

1347338,Range of normal operator and its adjoint are equal,On Wikipedia it is written that bounded normal operator in Hilbert space has the same range and kernel as its adjoint. I've been able to show equality of kernels and closures of ranges: $\|Af\|=\|A^*f\|$ so kernels must be equal. Furthermore kernel of an operator is equal to orthogonal complement of its adjoint so those must also be equal. By taking orthogonal complements we get equality of closures of ranges. However as far as I understand ranges need not be closed (but maybe in this case they are? I haven't been able to show it though) so equality of ranges does not follow. I would appreciate hints.

1347351,Technical name for an almost-monotonic function,"I'm wondering if there’s a technical name or short phrase that describes a function that’s monotonic, subject to some uniformly bounded amount of backtracking. $\exists \epsilon \forall x , y : y \gt x \Rightarrow f(y) \gt f(x) - \epsilon $ A simple example of this would be if you start with any monotonic function and add a fixed amount of error, jitter or oscillation. Concretely, if our epsilon is 20, you’d have a function that, once it reaches 100, we know it will never drop to 80 (or less) again. Extra credit: There's a similar form of near-monotonicity where the limit is on the function’s domain rather than the range. If this also has a name, I’d be curious to hear it—though the case I really care about is the one I described above.

1347378,Fundamental Lemma of the Calculus of Variations with higher derivatives,"The fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations is often presented as:

I am trying to prove the specific higher order case when $M$ is multiplied not by $\eta$ but by $\eta''$. The case for $\eta'$ is easy enough to understand (Lemma of du Bois-Reymond). So, the problem is this: If $M(x) \in C[a,b]$ such that $\int_{a}^{b}{M(x)\eta''(x)} = 0 ~~\forall\eta\in C^2[a,b],\eta(a)=\eta(b)=\eta'(a)=\eta'(b)=0$, then $M(x)=px+q$ for all $x\in[a,b]$.

1347436,Hottest Days of The Year,"Recently, there has been much talk in the media of it being the hottest day of the year so far. It has always seemed to me that there are likely many more of these in the northern hemisphere than the southern. In the northern hemisphere ""the year"" starts close to the local minimum and so for a good half of the year there is a fairly reasonable chance that a given day will be the hottest so far. However, in the southern hemisphere after an initial cluster of hot days it is very unlikely there will be another so hot until the end of the year, limiting the number ""hottest so far"". (And vice versa for cold). I'm interested in quantitative models of this kind of phenomenon (not just for temperature, but similar patterns). But I don't know how to start developing a model which is tractable. Maybe the year could be modeled as a sinusoid, with a superimposed zero-mean normally distributed random element. It seems that the likely number of ""highest""/""lowest"" so-fars should be expressible in terms as a function of starting phase and variance.

1347443,"Two ODEs, why is one solution the solution of the other?","This question is based on Zeidler II/B, Problem 30.2. Consider the ODE: find $u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ s.t.

given $F:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ Caratheodory. We know that if it has a solution, it satisfies $|u(t)| \leq C$ for all $t$. Let us suppose that there is $f \in L^1(0,T)$ such that $|F(t,a)| \leq f(t)$ for all $t$ and all $a$ such that $|a| \leq 2C$. Consider the ODE
$$v'(t) = \hat F(t,v(t))$$

1347504,"For which complex $a,\,b,\,c$ does $(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$ hold?","Wolfram Mathematica simplifies $(a^b)^c$ to $a^{bc}$ only for positive real $a, b$ and $c$. See W|A output . I've previously been struggling to understand why does $\dfrac{\log(a^b)}{\log(a)}=b$ and $\log(a^b)=b\log(a)$ not always hold (while I was always thinking of logarithms of positive reals as $\log_a(a^b)=\dfrac{\log(a^b)}{\log(a)}=\dfrac{b\log(a)}{\log(a)}=b$ before I've started to self-study complexes), but then learned about branch cutting of multifunctions, so that natural logarithm can be defined to be a function by first finding a set of $w$ for each $z$, so that $z=e^w$ (inverse natural exponential), and then somehow (no matter how) selecting a unique solution $w$ from that set, so that $\forall{z}\exists!{w}$, yielding a function $z\mapsto{w}$. This results in some sort of discontinuity where solutions are being dropped: This is done because functions are generally more easy to deal with than multifunctions. Wolfram's convention is to define $\log(z)$ as the inverse of $e^z$ such that $\log(1)=0$ and such that the branch cut discontinuity is at ${(-\infty;0]}$. I know this is somewhat unpopular to think of natural logarithm as a single-valued function, but I am going to follow this convention (I personally think it is well-justified, at least that's what happens with $\operatorname{arcsin}$, $\operatorname{sqrt}$, etc, so in fact I am comfortable with it). Then it is clear for me why is $\dfrac{\log\left((-2)^{-3}\right)}{\log(-2)}\approx{0.814319+0.841574i}\neq{-3}$, while $-3$ perfectly satisfies the equation $(-2)^x=(-2)^{-3}$. Given that $\log(a^b)=b\log(a)$ holds for positive real $a, b$ only , I thought how would I then solve equations of form $a^x=b$, where $a,b$ are complexes and not necessarily positive reals, since my first step was always to rewrite everything to base $e$:
$$e^{\log(a^x)}=e^{\log(b)}$$
and then carry the exponent out of the logarithm:
$$e^{x\log(a)}=e^{\log(b)}$$
(adding $2\pi i k,\,k\in\mathbb{Z}$ to any exponent and then eliminating the exponentials yields the result). So I've asked on ##math , where I've been pointed out that another way to rewrite $a^b$ to base $e$ is using the definition of the logarithm: $a^b=(a)^b=(e^{\log(a)})^b=e^{b\log(a)}$. I was happy with that (and even solved a $(-2)^x=-3$ for $x$ just for fun using this approach, see here ) but some time later I have realized that this neither does not actually work for arbitrary complex $a$ and $b$!
$$1=1^{1/2}=((-1)^2)^{1/2}=(-1)^{2\cdot\frac{1}{2}}=(-1)^1=-1$$
The rule $(a^b)^c$, as I was told by W|A, requires $a, b, c$ to be positive reals.
When I pointed that out on ##math , I was told that $a^b=e^{b\log(a)}$ is by definition of complex exponentiation. I've checked, and Wolfram Mathematica agreed with this identity. Too good!
But then I realized from these something must not be true: $(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$ holds only for positive real $a,b,c$ $\forall{a,b\in\mathbb{C}}:a^b=e^{b\log(a)}$ $\forall{a\in\mathbb{C}}:a=e^{log(a)}$ The latter is the definition of the logarithm, so should be true. The second also must be true, otherwise I do not know how to solve equations. Hence:
$$a^c=e^{c\log(a)}$$
is by the definition of complex exponentiation, just as I was told. Then, rewriting $a$ in the LHS using the definition of logarithm:
$$a=e^{log(a)}$$
$$\left(e^{log(a)}\right)^c=e^{c\log(a)}$$
Now, since that for every complex $b$ there exists a $z$ such that $b=\log(z)$, we can rewrite $\log(a)=b$:
$$(e^b)^c=e^{bc}$$
for all complex $b,c$! So, what is that? I've made a mistake? Or is base $a=e$ that special? Or is in fact (I suspect) one just needs to require $a$ to be positive real, and $b,c$ are in fact irrelevant?
$$\forall{a}\in\mathbb{R}\forall{b,c}\in\mathbb{C}:a>0\implies{(a^b)^c=a^{bc}}$$
Have I found a bug in Mathematica and W|A or made a huge stupid mistake leading myself to drastic misunderstanding? P. S. This is my first post at MSE, I am not a math major, just a hobbyist, so sorry if I am struggling at basics here. Also sorry for my English: it is not my native language. Edit: thank you @Andrew for your answer. $\forall{a,b,c}:-\pi<\Im(b\log(a))\leq\pi\implies(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$ Very clear and straightforward, works flawlessly. But it appears that though the implication is obviously true, there are more cases (read ""values of $a,\,b,\,c$"") from which $(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$ does follow, i.e. I found that it is true for $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ and arbitrary complex $a,\,b$, for example: $$\big((-2)^{-3}\big)^{-2}=(-2)^{(-3)\times(-2)};$$
$$\left(\frac{1}{(-2)^3}\right)^{-2}=(-2)^{6};$$
$$\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)^{-2}=64;$$
$$\left(-8\right)^2=64;$$
$$64=64.$$ For this case, $b\log(a)=-3\log(-2)=-3(\log(2)+i\pi)=-3\log(2)-3i\pi$, and hence $\Im(-3\log(2)-3i\pi)=-3\pi\notin{({-\pi;\pi}]}$, therefore @Andrew's implication does not cover all cases. So, is there any more solutions of $(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$?","['exponentiation', 'complex-numbers', 'exponential-function', 'logarithms', 'complex-analysis']"

There didn't seem to be a good geometric picture for how to swap two adjacent vertices without moving the others via linear mapping.

1347627,Equivalence of system of nonlinear equations,"Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a positive semidefinite matrix, $b\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $k>0$, and $g:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a positive function. Consider the system of nonlinear equations
$$
(1) \quad Ax=-k\frac{x}{g(x)}-b.

Let $A^+$ be the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of $A$. For every $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$, consider the system of nonlinear equations
$$
(2)\quad  x=-kA^+\frac{x}{g(x)}-A^+b+(I-A^+A)q.
$$
Find $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that (1) is equivalent to (2). My attempt 1) Observe that if $A$ is non-singular then (1) is equivalent to (2) for all $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Indeed, since $A$ is non-singular, $A^+=A^{-1}$ and so (2) is rewritten as $$
x=-kA^{-1}\frac{x}{g(x)}-A^{-1}b+(I-A^{-1}A)q
$$
which is equivalent to (1). 2) For each soluion $x$ of (1) there exists $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $x$ is the solution set of (2). Indeed, suppose that $x$ is a solution of (1). Then
$$
Ax=-k\frac{x}{g(x)}-b.
$$
Multiplying both sides of the above equation with $AA^+$ we obtain
$$
AA^+Ax=-AA^+k\frac{x}{g(x)}-AA^+b.
$$
Since $AA^+A=A$, the above equation is rewritten as
$$
A\left(x+kA^+\frac{x}{g(x)}+A^+b\right)=0.
$$
Therefore, there exits $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that 
$$
x+kA^+\frac{x}{g(x)}+A^+b=(I-A^+A)q
$$
or
$$
x=-kA^+\frac{x}{g(x)}-A^+b+(I-A^+A)q.
$$
Hence, $x$ is the solution of (2). Thank you for all kind help and comments.","['systems-of-equations', 'linear-algebra']"

1347685,Every function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous?,"This is a question that came up as a true false question in my textbook, and I was wondering what you thought of my reasoning. I claim that even though a graph of such a function doesn't look continuous, that by the sequential definition of continuity, that the function is continuous. According to the text book, a function $f:D \to R$ is said to be continuous at the point $x_0$ provided that whenever $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence in $D$ that converges to $x_0$, the image sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ converges to $f(x_0)$. The function is said to be continuous if this holds for all $x \in D$. It would seem that by this definition, a function $f:\mathbb N \to \mathbb R$ would be continuous. Loosely speaking, a sequence of natural numbers has to eventually be constant in order to be convergent (i.e. {1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,...}), since the smallest difference between natural numbers is $1$, and we can pick $0 < \epsilon <1$. Therefore, the image sequence will eventually be constant as well, so no matter what $\epsilon$ we choose, we can always find an index $N$ such that $f(x_n) - f(x_0) = 0 < \epsilon$ for all indices $n \geq N$. Therefore we can always meet the requirement for convergence of $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$ and thus $f$ is continuous. What do you all think?","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

Fishing around the internet a bit for some alternative answers and it looks like the approaches others have taken to this problem are not the same way that I approached it, so I'm concerned that I'm making some conceptual errors.  The problem: Let {A$_{\alpha}$} be a collection of subsets of X.  Let X=$\cup_{\alpha}$A$_{\alpha}$.  Let f: X$\rightarrow$Y; suppose that f$\mid$A$_{\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.  An indexed family of sets {A$_{\alpha}$} is said to be locally finite if each point of X has a neighborhood that intersects A$_{\alpha}$ for only finitely many values of $\alpha$.  Show that if the family {A$_{\alpha}$} is locally finite and each A$_{\alpha}$ is closed, then f is continuous. Attempt at solution: Let x $\in$ X.  Since there exists a neighborhood U$_{x}$ of x that intersects A$_{\alpha}$ for only finitely many $\alpha$, U$_{x}$ can be contained in a finite collection of A$_{\alpha}$'s.  So x $\in$ U$_{x}$ $\subset$ $\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$ $\subset$ X.  Then, since each A$_{i}$ is closed and f$\mid$A$_{i}$ continuous for each i, by repeated application of the Pasting Lemma, f$\mid$$\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$ is continuous.  Then, since U$_{x}$ $\subset$ $\cup_{i=1}^{n}$A$_{i}$, by restricting the domain (Theorem 18.2d), f$\mid$U$_{x}$ continuous.  Since it is given that such a neighborhood U$_{x}$ exists for each x $\in$ X, then X can be written as the union of open sets U$_{x}$, where f$\mid$U$_{x}$ is continuous for each x, and so by Theorem 18.2f (local formulation of continuity), f: X$\rightarrow$Y is continuous.

$$ D(P_n\|Q_n) \to D(P\|Q)$$ 
follows from continuity and the fact that it is a finite sum. To recall, for finite/countable sets, KL Divergence is given by
$$D(P\|Q) = \sum_{k=1}^{|A|}P(k)\log_2\left(\frac{P(k)}{Q(k)}\right)$$ Now for uncountable sets, one would use a slightly different definition of divergence (if $A$ here were uncountable but a measurable space with a Borel Sigma algebra). For any two measures $P$ and $Q$ on $A$ where $P \ll Q$ ($P$ is absolutely continuous wrt $Q$), we have
$$D(P\|Q) = \int_A \frac{dP}{dQ}\log\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}\right)dQ$$
where $\frac{dP}{dQ}$ is the Radon Nikodym derivative of $P$ wrt $Q$.
My question is, Suppose $P_n \to^w P$ and $Q_n \to^w Q$, and $P_n \ll Q_n ~ \forall n$, does it follow that 
$$ D(P_n\|Q_n) \to D(P\|Q)$$
? (Here ""$\to^w$"" denotes weak convergence). My attempt: My guess was that it would not hold every time but in certain cases. To characterize them, I started with understanding $D(P_n\|Q)$. This is simply 
$$D(P_n\|Q) = \int_A \frac{dP_n}{dQ}\log\left(\frac{dP_n}{dQ}\right)dQ$$.

1348026,Open Ball in a Metric Space vs. Open Set in a Topological Space,"I'm having trouble understanding the notion of an open set when applied to a space without a metric defined on it. I have read that all metric spaces are naturally a topological space, but the converse is not true. Topological spaces definitions I have read use the idea of open sets, and I can't understand this abstract idea of openness or closedness of a set without having a notion of distance. I can understand the notion of open and closed sets in a metric space from the definitions I have read using the idea of distance and open balls. So for example given a metric space $M$ with the metric $d$ , we can say a set $U \subset M$ is open if $\forall x \in U, \exists B(x,r) \subset U$ , which says that we can choose any point within the set $U$ and there will always be some sufficiently small distance $r$ that we can move in any direction to another point $y$ that is also contained within $U$ . This has an intuitive conceptual meaning in my head regardless of space $M$ or metric $d$ . Now take the example of a space $F$ , a fruit bowl with $3$ apples, $3$ oranges and $2$ bananas. There is no metric defined on the space $F$ to determine a distance between its elements, the fruit. Can we define an open set on this space? In order to be a topological space we need to be able to define open sets right?","['intuition', 'metric-spaces', 'general-topology']"

But, I simply do not have the time to devote myself to such things, though it may be not at all time-consuming a task, and so I tried to find a contradiction of this conjecture but I was unable to. So, my question is, can anyone hint me at a contradiction or at a method of proof as time-consuming as a proof by contradiction, but before all that tell me whether this conjecture is even valid, been spoken of, or simply downright idiotic.

1348379,formal definition of ordinal addition by recursion,"I'm reading Kunen's Set Theory, An Introduction to Independence Proofs (1980). On page 26 he explains how to introduce ordinal addition through recursion. For the sake of convenience i'll give the necessary information. What does Transfinite Recursion state? It states the following: For any formula F $(x,y)$ we can define a formula G $(v,y)$ such that $$\forall x \; \exists ! \; y F(x,y) \to [\forall \alpha \; \exists ! \; y \; \mathrm{{\bf G}}(\alpha, y) \wedge \forall \alpha \exists x \exists y \; (\mathrm{{\bf G}}(\alpha, y) \wedge \mathrm{{\bf F}}(x, y) \wedge x = \mathrm{{\bf G}}|\alpha)],$$
  where $x = \mathrm{{\bf G}}|\alpha$ abbreviates
  $$ x \mathrm{\;is\; a \; function} \wedge \mathrm{dom}\;x = \alpha \wedge \forall \beta\in\mathrm{dom}\;x \;\; \mathrm{{\bf G}}(\beta,x(\beta))$$ So it says in fact that for any formula F $(x,y)$ which under certain conditions (if applied for instance by Comprehension Scheme to define a subset of some set) can define a set of ordered pairs (i.e. a relation) which is a function, then we can define a formula G $(v,y)$ which is also a function (it can be viewed as a function on the class of all ordinals) such that its value on any ordinal is exactly the value of F on the set which is the restriction of G to $\alpha$. Next addition of ordinals by means of recursion is defined as follows. For any ordinal $\alpha$ a function $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha$ is defined so that $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha(x) = 0$ unless $x$ is a function with domain some ordinal $\beta$, in which case $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha(x)$ is $\alpha$ if $\beta = 0$, $S(x(\beta - 1))$ if $\beta$ is a successor and $\bigcup \{x(\xi) : \xi < \beta\}$ if $\beta$ is limit. and here my troubles begin, in fact. First of all, The successor function $S$ was previously defined only for ordinals. Okay, we may count that $S(x) = x\cup \{x\}$ for any set $x$. But then the definition of $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha$ just doesn't make sense... i mean why it gives the desired result...
Then we get this unique function $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha$ (these formulas are treated as functions on classes) defined on ordinals such that $\forall \beta [\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha(\beta) = \mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha(\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha|\beta)]$. So this function gives us the addition in fact because, given any ordinal $\beta$, what is $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha |\beta$? it is, loosely speaking, the set of all ordered pairs $(a,y)$ such that $a\in\beta$ and $y = \mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha (\beta)$ (so it is a function which assigns to each ordinal $a \subset \beta$ some $y$ such that $y = \mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha(a)$)... And then we say that if $\beta$ is a successor, to calculate $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha (\beta)$ this $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha$ has to give out the successor of the value of $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha$ on $\beta - 1$ (i.e. it is $S(\alpha + \beta - 1)$ in fact, and if $\beta$ is limit, $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha$ has to give out an ordinal in fact which is the supremum of the values of $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha$ on ordinals lesser than $\beta$, i.e. it is (in different notation) $\bigcup \{\alpha + \xi | \xi < \beta\}$, so hence this function $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha$ defines the true addition (which can be defined without recursion as the unique ordinal isomorphic to a certain well-ordered set obtained on the basis of $\alpha$ and $\beta$)? Okay, how can we define multiplication formally then? First we define this $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha$ to be again 0 unless $x$ is a function with domain some ordinal $\beta$. In case $x$ is as desired, define $\mathrm{{\bf F}}_\alpha(x)$ to be 0 if $\beta = 0$, $x(\beta - 1) + \alpha$ if $\beta$ is a successor and $\bigcup \{x(\xi)|\xi < \beta\}$ if $\beta$ is limit. And then we get the unique $\mathrm{{\bf G}}_\alpha$ which in fact for any ordinal $\beta$ gives us the $\alpha\cdot \beta$? is that right?

These are some of the properties for $\mathbb{R}_l$ mentioned in the book. 1) It is Hausdorff 2) It is first countable but not second countable 3) It is normal Here is my understanding of the proofs for these properties. 1) $\mathbb{R}_l$ is Hausdorff as if I consider two points $x$ and $y$ with $x<y$, I can find disjoint open sets $[x,y)$ and $[y,y+\delta)$ containing $x$ and $y$, respectively. 2) It is first countable as every point $x$ in $\mathbb{R}_l$ has a countable basis, but I don't understand why it is not second countable, as it should have countable basis for this topology. Is it because if I consider an open set for the standard topology on $R$, say $(a,b)$, this set is an union of uncountable open sets in $\mathbb{R}_l$ $(a,b)=\cup_{a<x<b}[x,b)$ 3) I understand the proof given in the book for $\mathbb{R}_l$ to be normal. Please tell me if my understanding of these concepts is correct. I would appreciate if someone can provide more deeper insight about these concepts.","['sorgenfrey-line', 'general-topology']"

1348421,Regularity of compactly supported solutions to the divergence equation: $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v}=g$.,"I have two questions, one specific and one general, on this result for compactly supported solutions to the divergence equation in star-like domains.  The result which can be found in Galdi's ""An introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations"" volume 1, and may have originated with Bogovskii in 1979 or so, states: If $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) that is star-like with respect to every point in the unit ball $B_1(0)=B,\ \overline{B}\subset \Omega$, and $g\in W_0^{k,p}(\Omega)$ for $k\geq 0$ and $p>1$ with $\int_\Omega g\ dV=0$ then letting $\omega$ be smooth, compactly supporting in $B$, and $\int_B\omega\ dV=1$, the vector field
$$
\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})= \int_\Omega g(\mathbf{y})\left[ \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|^n}\int_{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}^\infty \omega\left(\mathbf{y}+\xi\frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\right)\xi^{n-1}d\xi\right]dV_\mathbf{y}
$$
satisfies $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{x})$ and $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{k+1,p}(\Omega)^n$.  Specifically, $\mathbf{v}$ has support in the convex combinations of the support of $g$ and $B$. If $g\in L^p(\Omega)$ this provides a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)^n$, however if $g$ has more regularity (but is not compactly supported) it does not appear that $\mathbf{v}$ necessarily possesses the extra regularity up to the boundary (does it?).  Other methods show there are solutions with higher regularity up to the boundary but may not retain the property of compact support. My specific question is if there is a manner to adapt this result to a case like $\Omega_+=\{\mathbf{x}\in \Omega: \mathbf{e}_0\cdot \mathbf{x}>0\}$ and given data $g\in W^{k,p}_0(\Omega)$ get a solution $\mathbf{v}\in W^{k,p}(\Omega_+)^n$, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions when $\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_0=0$ and has compact support in $\overline{\Omega_+}\cap \Omega$.  I think this would be a useful result and wonder if there is a similar formula including a Green's function on the hyperplane.  I am not very comfortable with the techniques and would appreciate the help of someones expertise. More generally, what is the property of the divergence operator that allows the construction of such a compactly supported solution and are there other operators for which a similar result applies?

Also, regarding commutative, I would think that that the parentheses don't matter since all of the variables are connected by disjunctions only. Thus couldn't one also reason that $(\neg p \lor \neg q) \lor (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q \lor p \lor q$? If so than it would seem easy to rearrange this by the commutative law.

However, no proof of Monsky's theorem which I have seen explained why this extension exists. One of the proofs has mentioned that the proof of existence requires axiom of choice. This made me think that standard argument using Zorn's lemma would do the trick, but I have realized that giving arbitrary value to an irrational will not always lead to consistent valuation (e.g. we can't set $|\sqrt{2}|_2=1$, as this would lead to $|2|_2=|\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}|_2=|\sqrt{2}|_2^2=1\neq\frac{1}{2}=|2|_2$).

Can someone point me to a reference which will help me classify the stability types of these equilibria (whether they are saddle points, centres, sources, sinks, etc.). Specifically, I want to know what can be said by using linearizations (ie. with Jacobians) - I realize that what can be said using just this method is probably quite limited. I know that the Hartman-Grobman theorem is helpful. The way I understand it, this theorem says that if the Jacobian of the system evaluated at $\bf{x}^{*}$ has eigenvalues $\{ \lambda_{j} \}_{j=1}^{n}$ such that $\text{Re}(\lambda_{j})\neq0$ for all $j$, then: if all eigenvalues are negative then it is asymptotically stable (sink) if all eigenvalues are positive then it is unstable (source) if there is a mix of positive and negative eigenvalues, then its a saddle point Is this correct? Can you say anything else if $\text{Re}(\lambda_{j})=0$ for one or more $j$?

Attempt Since the sum of exponentials is a scaled gamma, $S=X+Y$~$Ga(1,2)$, where the rate is 1 and the shape is 2. When $X+Y\leq 3$, the probability is 1 that $\{X<3\}$. I checked this also by solving: $$P(X<3|X+Y\leq 3)=\frac{P(X<3,Y<3-X)}{P(S\leq 3)}=\frac{\int_0^3\int_0^{3-x} e^{-x}e^{-y}dy dx}{\int_0^3 se^{-s}ds}=1$$ Now when $X+Y>3$, I compute a similar quantity, namely, $$P(X<3|X+Y> 3)=\frac{P(X<3,Y>3-X)}{P(S> 3)}=\frac{3}{4}$$ Interpretation Assuming that the above quantities are correct, could I interpret the quantity $P(X<3|X+Y>3)$ as follows: ""Given that the sum is greater than 3, the chances that the one of the variables is less than 3 is distributed uniformly (due to memoryless property of exponential r.v.'s). That is, if the sum is >3, and if we fix e.g. Y=3, then on average the sum is $Y + E(X)=4$, and we get that X<3, 3/4ths of the time.""
