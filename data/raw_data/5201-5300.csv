38456,How can I a priori justify a power series ansatz to solve an ODE?,"I am currently thinking about how to a priori justify a power series ansatz to solve a nonlinear ODE of first order. Let, for example, $y'(x)=y^2-x^2$ with $y(0)=1$.
The right hand side of the ODE is smooth, thus any solution is smooth and, by Picard-Lindelöf's Theorem, locally unique. Yet it is not necessarily real analytic. Suppose we do a power series ansatz, say $y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n  ~~ $ for $ x \in (-1,1)$. We calculate the Cauchy-Product to get $y^2$ and obtain a recursive formula to calculate the coefficients $a_n$ by 'coefficient comparison' (don't know if this is the english word). The problem I have with that is, that we must assume $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ to be absolutely convergent in $(-1,1)$ to merely write down the Cauchy-Product. Obviously the convergence of this series depends on it's coefficients; but we use the Cauchy-Product to calculate the coefficients... Suppose we have calculated them and afterwards we prove that the series is absolutely convergent in $(-1,1)$. Also we prove that the series is a solution of our ODE. Now everything's fine... But my question is: Is there a cleaner way to justify the power series ansatz? For example, can one show that solutions of ODE's of the above type are real analytic?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

38474,"Set of Finite Subsets of an Infinite Set (Enderton, Chapter 6.32)","Exercise 6.32 (Enderton, Elements of Set Theory ) ( answer to same question ) states: Let $\mathsf{F}(A)$ be the set of all finite subsets of $A$. Show that if $A$ is infinite then $A \approx \mathsf{F}(A)$. For the purposes of this exercise, I could use the approach cited. However, I want to know what is wrong with the attempt (2) I made. I will describe it informally. If $|A| = \aleph_0$ then the injection $f(x) = \{x\} : A \rightarrow \mathsf{F}(A)$ gives $|A| \leq |\mathsf{F}(A)|$. Conversely, the bijections $f : \omega \rightarrow A$ and $g : \bigcup_{i \in \omega} \omega^i \rightarrow \omega$ (i.e., a tupling function) can be composed to obtain an injection $f : \mathsf{F}(A) \rightarrow A$. So $|\mathsf{F}(A)| \leq |A|$. By the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem, $|A| = |\mathsf{F}(A)|$ and $A \approx \mathsf{F}(A)$. If not, I want to do the following: (i) define a set $H$ of bijections from subsets of $\mathsf{F}(A)$ to subsets of $A$; (ii) show that $H$ is closed under union of chains ($\bigcup B : \mathsf{F}(A) \rightarrow A$ is bijective where $B$ is a chain in $H$); (iii) employ Zorn's Lemma to obtain a maximal function $f \in H$; (iv) conclude that $\mathsf{F}(A) \approx A$. This approach would be very easy, because I could appeal to prior theorems regarding unions of functions and so on. After step (iii), I need to show that $dom(f) = \mathsf{F}(A)$ and $ran(f) = \mathsf{F}(A)$. So I suppose not and obtain a contradiction due to $f$'s maximality in $H$. However, this is problematic. Why? Because in each attempt that I have made, I can replace the ""finite powerset"" operator by the powerset operator throughout and obtain a false statement. So I am missing something about $\mathsf{F}(A)$. I'm not sure what this is.",['elementary-set-theory']
38480,How much does symbolic integration mean to mathematics?,"(Before reading, I apologize for my poor English ability.) I have enjoyed calculating some symbolic integrals as a hobby, and this has been one of the main source of my interest towards the vast world of mathematics. For instance, the integral below
$$ \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \arctan (1 - \sin^2 x \; \cos^2 x) \,\mathrm dx = \pi \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \arctan \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2}} \right). $$
is what I succeeded in calculating today. But recently, as I learn advanced fields, it seems to me that symbolic integration is of no use for most fields in mathematics. For example, in analysis where the integration first stems from, now people seem to be interested only in performing numerical integration. One integrates in order to find an evolution of a compact hypersurface governed by mean curvature flow, to calculate a probabilistic outcome described by Ito integral, or something like that. Then numerical calculation will be quite adequate for those problems. But it seems that few people are interested in finding an exact value for a symbolic integral. So this is my question: Is it true that problems related to symbolic integration have lost their attraction nowadays? Is there no such field that seriously deals with symbolic calculation (including integration, summation) anymore?","['symbolic-computation', 'integration', 'numerical-methods']"
38481,"Value of $\int P(z) d \bar{z}$, with $P(z)$ a polynomial",Let $C$ be a circle in the complex plane with center $a$ and radius $R$. I am trying to evaluate $\oint_{C} P(z) d \bar{z}$. If I set $z=\bar{u}$ then we have $\bar{z}=u$ and $d\bar{z}=du$. Thus we may write $\oint_{C} P(z) d \bar{z} = \oint_{\bar{C}} P(\bar{u}) du$ where $\bar{C}$ is circle with radius $R$ and center $\bar{a}$. If $P(\bar{u})$ was an analytic function of $u$ I could apply Cauchy's Theorem and get 0. Does it matter that the conjugation function is not analytic?

38491,(Non-)Conservative Vector Fields,"As anyone who has taken vector calculus (read: most of you) knows, if a vector field is conservative, then it is the gradient of a potential function. In other words, if the vector field is two dimensional, the potential function is a surface and as such some things become really nice, like the line integral of a closed curve being zero. However, there are some very simple vector fields that are not conservative, which leads me to wonder what the corresponding surface would look like and in particular what characteristics of the surface disallow the nice formulations. For instance, the surface corresponding to the vector field $F = y \hat{i} - x \hat{j}$ is continuous but periodic, spiraling along the z-axis. I envision it to look kinda like this: My question is thus: do all non-conservative vector fields (in 2-space) have corresponding surfaces that are periodic or discontinuous? If not, what other cases are there?",['multivariable-calculus']
38497,Understanding when to use product rule and when to use sum rule?,"Suppose there are $n$ couples in a party. What is the way of choosing a man and a woman who are not a couple.

Now, I cannot decide if I should use the sum rule or the product rule, i.e are the total possibilities $2n-1$ or $n^2-n$. $E_1$ and $E_2$ do not seem to be independent, as the event E_1 automatically determines the set of $E_2$.

38528,"When do Pell equation results imply applicability of the ""Vieta jumping""-method to a given conic?","This question is motivated by a remark of Bill Dubuque on my answer to the following question: An Algorithm to compute the GCD of polynomials of coprime numbers? Vieta jumping is based on the idea that if you have a quadratic equation with integer coefficients that is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, you can try to find a descent argument by replacing $x$ by the other root of the equation and then changing the roles of $x$ and $y$. see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta_jumping To quote Bill Dubuque's comment: ""Vieta jumping"" is a strange name for what is essentially descent in a group of integer points on a conic (realized by reflection).

38620,"Injective, surjective and bijective for linear maps","I have problems showing that $\phi$ is surjective. My understanding is, that I have to show for every $u \in \mathbb{R}^3$ that there exists a $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$ but I am not sure how. Let $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$. Let's examine the $\mathbb{R}$-linear map $\phi:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ defined through:
  $\phi(e_1)=\begin{bmatrix}b \\ -c \\ 1\end{bmatrix}, \phi(e_2)=\begin{bmatrix}a \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \phi(e_3)=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ with $e_1, e_2, e_3$ as standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Is $\phi$ injective, surjective, bijective? If $\phi$ is bijective, find the inverse function $\phi^{-1}$. My first step was to determine the linear map itself by: $\phi(x,y,z) = x\phi(e_1) + y\phi(e_2) + z\phi(e_3) = x\begin{pmatrix}b \\ -c \\1\end{pmatrix} + y\begin{pmatrix}a \\ 1 \\0\end{pmatrix} + z\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\0\end{pmatrix}$ Now I want to show, that $\phi$ is injective: Since $\ker \phi$ must be $\{0\}$ I have following linear system of equations:
  $\begin{align} bx+ay+z = 0 \\ -cx + y = 0\\x = 0\end{align}$ So it follows $x = y = z = 0$. Therefore $\phi$ must be injective.

38647,Understanding $n\choose k$ in terms of sum and product rules,"This is a follow up on my earlier question. To put some values and context, let me say I am trying to justify the number of possibilities of choosing 2 chapters out of 10 in a book i,e $10 \choose 2$. At this point this is just notation. One way to enumerate the possibilities: $$\underbrace{\underbrace{(1,2),(1,3)\cdots,(1,10)}_{9}\underbrace{(2,1),(2,3)\cdots,(2,10)}_{9}\cdots\underbrace{(10,1),(10,2)\cdots,(10,9)}_{9}}_{10}$$ So we have $10\cdot 9$ possibilities but we've double counted pairs such as $(n,m)$ and $(m,n)$ so we have $\frac{10\cdot 9}{2}$. Now I try to reason with the sum and product rules I've learnt and once again Im confused, which might become detrimental if I go further. Say I select chapter $1$. I can select chapter $2$ OR $3$ etc. Once I have selected one chapter, the selection of the other chapter is independent w.r.t one another,  so using the sum rule I can make total $9$ possible selections once I have selected the first chapter. But then, I can make $10$ different choices of the first chapter. Now it is clear in my mind that each one of these ten possible selections come bundled with 9 possibilities, so multiply the two. But when I read the definition many times and try to bring in a ""product-rule argument"" and I just cannot. It should come as easily as the thought that I should multiply it, so I've only understood the product rule in words. Please enlighten me. Another thing I noticed, was that this could be achieved using a purely sum rule argument. Consider the enumeration scheme where we avoid repetition altogether $$\underbrace{(1,2),(1,3),\cdots,(1,10)}_{9},\underbrace{(2,3),(2,4),\cdots,(2,10)}_{8}\underbrace{(3,4),(3,5),\cdots,(3,10)}_{7},\cdots\underbrace{(9,10)}_1$$ $$=9+8+\cdots+1=\frac{10\cdot 9}{2}$$ Only the sum rule has been used in this argument. And it is much easier for me to understand. So, a parenthetical query: can a purely product rule argument be used for selections? It does not seem so for me. It appears the sum rule is fundamental and product rule is a special case of it. Which might seem like saying that multiplication is a special case of addition in discrete case. Once again, this last paragraph is just a parenthetical query and not my immediate concern at the moment.","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
38661,Multidimensional Interpolation within a polygon,"Apologies in advance if I get terminologies wrong (not sure if ""multidimensional interpolation"" is the right term), I'm not really that great at maths, but here goes: Suppose we have two 2D points, point A(x1,y1) and point B(x2, y2). If we associate both Point A and point B with a z value, then for any point P in the map, we can determine it's z value by interpolating between points A and B's z values. So if P is right in between A and B, the z value will be the average of the two, if it's right on A it'll have A's z value etc. (to calculate the z value, we just get the conjugate of the complex number (B - A), multiply that with (P - A) and get it's x value and then interpolate as usual. But what about when there's 3 points, or 4 points? I gather 3 points can be done easily, I mean you can already picture the 3 points as forming a plane. But how do I get the ""z"" value for 4 or more points? Because I'm using this for a game I'm developing, the 4 points would always be a polygon, and I need interpolated points that are inside an edge of the polygon (that is, right in between two neighboring points), to be in a straight line.. My current approach right now is just to split the 4 points into two triangles, but I'd like to have something easier/faster on the CPU.

38664,When is the expected number of events per period the inverse of the expected duration between events?,"I'm trying to model the time between successive events in a sequence of events. Let $T_i$ ($i=1,2,\ldots$) be the time between event $i$ and $i+1$. Assume that the $T_i$ are independent and identically distributed and have the expected value $D$. Let $\tau_i=\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} T_k$ be the time of occurrence of event $i$, with $\tau_1$ defined as $0$. I'm interested in the expected average number of events per period (equation 1):
$$E\left(\lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^\infty I(\tau_i \leq T)\right)$$
where $I(\tau_i \leq T)$ is an indicator variable which is $1$ when $\tau_i \leq T$ and $0$ otherwise. It seems to be that this should just equal the inverse of the expected duration between events, i.e.
$$1/E(T_i)$$ One approach which I took to proving this is to consider the average number of events per period only at time points at which some event has occurred. If I take $T=\tau_i$ in the expression of which the limit is taken in equation(1), we would have (equation 2):
$$\frac{i}{\tau_i}$$ Taking the limit as $i \to \infty$, the strong law of large numbers would make this equal $1/D$ on almost all paths. Would this be enough to show that its expectation would also be $1/D$? Also how do I prove that I get the same average number of events per period for each sample path regardless of whether I take the limit in the definition of the average over all points of time or only over points of time at which an event occurs? If there had been an upper bound on $T_i$ this would have been trivial, but are there more general conditions under which I can make this move (for example, would finite variance of $T_i$ work)?

When one is showing that $f$ is injective, I think the proof should go something like this: if $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q} \in \text{Proj } T$ satisfy $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p}) = \varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})$, then $\mathfrak{p} \cap T_d = \mathfrak{q} \cap T_d$ for sufficiently large $d$.

As you may know, gerrymandering is a significant social problem, in that it stifles voters' opinions. So, my idea was this: Why not make a rule that perimeter/area always has to be under a certain value.
I figured this would limit how salamander-like the districts could be made. Then, I tried to figure out the math of this on the assumption that it was a simple calculus min/max problem. It seems not to be... The biggest problem I'm running into is how to formalize the idea of a shape being weird. My intuition tells me that the lower perimeter/area is, the less weird the shape. I.e. a wacky snakey shape designed to get several populations will have a higher perimeter/area than a more reasonable district shape, which should be vaguely rectangular or circular.

Is there a better way to understand why complex Galois representations are finite? I've heard it informally explained that this happens because the topologies on $\mathbf{G}_{\bar{\mathbf{Q}}}$ and $GL_{d}(\mathbf{C})$ are incompatible, with too many open sets on the latter. While the proof I posted above does illustrate this, I'm wondering if there's another proof that may be more to my taste. Bonus/Related Question: it has been my assumption all along that the topology on $GL_{d}(\mathbf{C})$ is the standard one. However, another comment D&S make leads me to wonder if I'm wrong. In discussing the relationship between Dirichlet characters and $1$-dimensional representations $\rho : \mathbf{G}_{\bar{\mathbf{Q}}} \to \mathbf{C}^*$, they say that to check continuity of $\rho$, it suffices to check that $\rho^{-1}(1)$ is open.

Almost done, but I need some help. My trial: Let $f:A\to B$, $B$ a finitely generated $A$-algebra which is a field. Since $f(A)$ is Jacobson and $A$-algebra/module actually means that $f(A)$-algebra/module, we can assume that $A \subseteq B$. Pick $s\in A$ as in Ex. 5.21 (see below). Because $A$ is Jacobson, $J(A)=0$ so we can find a maximal ideal $m$ not containing $s$. Let $k:=A/m$ and $f:A \twoheadrightarrow k \hookrightarrow \bar{k}$, then $f(s) \neq 0$, so $f$ extends to $g:B\to \bar{k}$. Because $B$ is a field, $g$ is either injective or trivial. But $g(s)=f(s) \neq 0$ so $g$ is injective and $B \simeq g(B)$. Suppose $B=A[z_1,\cdots,z_m]$, then $g(B)$ $=$ $g(A)[g(z_1),\cdots,g(z_m)]$ $=$ $k[g(z_1),\cdots,g(z_m)]$. Each $g(z_i)$ is in $\bar{k}$ hence integral over $k$, so $g(B)$ is finitely generated $k$-module. Now the question: 1. How can I deduce that $B$ is a finitely generated $A$-module? 2. $g(A)=f(A)=k$ but $g$ is injective. How can it be possible? I think that $A$ strictly(?) contains $k$.

Show that there exists $s \neq 0$ in $A$ such that, if $\Omega$ is an algebraically closed field and $f:A\to \Omega$ is a homomorphism for which $f(s) \neq 0$, then $f$ can be extended to a homomorphism $B\to \Omega$.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

That's how I came to know about the subject Arithmetic Topology. Wikipedia describes this subject as: Arithmetic topology is an area of mathematics that is a combination of algebraic number theory and topology. In the 1960s topological interpretations of class field theory were given by John Tate based on Galois cohomology, and also by Michael Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier based on Étale cohomology. In subsequent years, Barry Mazur and Yuri Manin pointed out a series of analogies between prime ideals and knots.

For me, it is hard to, intuitively, see this in the case that $n$ is an odd composite natural number. Here is my reasoning thus far: Let $n=5$. (I understand this is simple when considering the minimal polynomial). Since the conjugate of an $n$th root of unity is also an $n$th root of unity, it is easy to see that, when written in trigonometric form, the sum (possible reordering here) $1+\alpha^1+\alpha^2+\alpha^3+\alpha^4$ $=1+( \cos (72)+i \sin (72))+( \cos (144) + i \sin (144))+( \cos (72)-i \sin (72))+( \cos (144)-i \sin (144))$ $=1+2 \cos (72)+2 \cos (144)$.

Now I am curious about what is going on within homeomorphism classes of ordinals. In particular, I want to know how to characterize countable ordinals $\alpha$ which are minimal among all ordinals homeomorphic to $\alpha$. Certainly finite ordinals and $\omega$ are easy. Next, if $\alpha\cong \omega+1$, then it seems like we would have to have $\omega+1\leq \alpha<\omega +\omega$ since there can only be one limit point in $\alpha$. Things become a little fuzzier for me with ordinals that have infinitely many limit points. For instance, suppose $\alpha$ is an ordinal homeomorphic to $\omega^{\omega}$.

A related statement is true:  Let $G = H \ltimes K$ be a semidirect product of $H$ with the (arbitrary) normal subgroup $K$, and let $x$ in $H$.  Suppose $hk$ centralizes $x$.  Then considering the group mod $K$, one gets that $h$ centralizes $x$.  Hence $k$ centralizes $x$, and $C_G(x) = C_H(x) \cdot C_K(x)$.  Importantly, we have the equality: $$[ G : C_G(x) ] = [ G/K : C_{G/K}(x) ] [ K : C_K(x) ] .$$ If $G$ splits over $K = O_{p'}(G)$ so that $G = H \ltimes K$, then every $p$-element is conjugate to some element of $H$, and the previous implies the conjugacy class sizes behave as I expect.  However, $G$ often does not split over $K$ and I am not sure what happens then. So suppose $G$ is a finite group with normal subgroup $K$.  One still has that every $h$ centralizing $x$ gives rise to an $hK$ in $C_{G/K}(x)$ and of course $C_G(x)$ is a union of cosets of $C_K(x)$.  However, it is not clear that all elements $hK$  of $C_{G/K}(x)$ give rise to elements $h$ in $C_G(x)$.  In other words, I can only prove that: $$[ G : C_G(x) ] \geq [ G/K : C_{G/K}(x) ] [ K : C_K(x) ] .$$ I checked for counterexamples (small groups up to order $1000$ except $768$, primitive groups up to degree $500$ except $343$, and perfect groups up to order $10^6$ available in GAP), but found no counterexamples to equality.  I am not sure if the coprime hypothesis is truly relevant, but it is the case of interest and I could not think of any other way to say ""$x$ in $H$"" when $G$ did not split.  With absolutely no hypotheses on $x$ or $K$, then $G$ dihedral of order 8 with $K = Z(G)$ and $x$ a non-central involution gives a counterexample, but this is not at all similar to the case I am interested in.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

Prop 1 $a \sim a$ Prop 2 $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$. Prop 3 $(a \sim b$ and $b \sim c)$ imply $a \sim c$. Statement Property 2 of an equivalence relation states that if $a \sim b$ then $b \sim a$. By property 3, we have the transitivity i.e. $a \sim b$, and $b \sim c$ then $a \sim c$. What is wrong with following proof that property 2 and 3 imply property 1? Let $a \sim b$; then $b \sim a$, whence by property 3 (using $a = c$), $a \sim a$. I think I can prove this to be wrong. Without proving equivalence relation first, one can not use $a = c$. Right? After all, equality is equivalent to 'equivalence relation' and 'axiom of substitution' are satisfied. If this is right, then I have trouble with the next part of this problem. Part 2 Can you suggest an alternative of property 1 which will insure us that prop 2 and prop 3 do imply 1? Can one give such a formulation without using the idea of '=' or otherwise?

what is the meaning of $-x-$? I guess that because a probability distribution function is a right-continuous function, maybe Chung wanted to emphasize that it is the left limit that is used to define symmetric distribution. Thanks and regards!","['probability-theory', 'real-analysis']"
39269,How does Cantor's diagonal argument work?,"I'm having trouble understanding Cantor's diagonal argument.  Specifically, I do not understand how it proves that something is ""uncountable"".  My understanding of the argument is that it takes the following form (modified slightly from the wikipedia article, assuming base 2, where the numbers must be from the set $ \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace $ ): \begin{align}
s_1 &= (\mathbf{0},1,0,\dots)\\
s_2 &= (1,\mathbf{1},0,\dots)\\
s_3 &= (0,0,\mathbf{1},\dots)\\
\vdots &= (s_n \text{ continues})
\end{align} In this case, the diagonal number is the bold diagonal numbers $(0, 1, 1)$ , which when ""flipped"" is $(1,0,0)$ , neither of which is $s_1$ , $s_2$ , or $s_3$ . My question, or misunderstanding, is: When there exists the possibility that more $s_n$ exist, as is the case in the example above, how does this ""prove"" anything?  For example: \begin{align}
s_0 &= (1,0,0,\mathbf{0},\dots)\ \ \textrm{ (...the wikipedia flipped diagonal)}\\
s_1 &= (\mathbf{0},1,0,\dots)\\
s_2 &= (1,\mathbf{1},0,\dots)\\
s_3 &= (0,0,\mathbf{1},\dots)\\
s_4 &= (0,1,1,\mathbf{1},\dots)\\
s_4 &= (1,0,0,\mathbf{1},\dots)\ \ \textrm{ (...alternate, flipped } s_4\textrm{)}\\
s_5 &= (1,0,0,0,\dots)\\
s_6 &= (1,0,0,1,\dots)\\
\vdots &= (s_n \text{ continues})
\end{align} In other words, as long as there is a $\dots \text{ continues}$ at the end, the very next number could be the ""impossible diagonal number"", with the caveat that it's not strictly identical to the ""impossible diagonal number"" as the wikipedia article defines it: For each $m$ and $n$ let $s_{n,m}$ be the $m^{th}$ element of the $n^{th}$ sequence on the list; so for each $n$ , $$s_n = (s_{n,1}, s_{n,2}, s_{n,3}, s_{n,4}, \dots).$$ ...snip... Otherwise, it would be possible by the above process to construct a sequence $s_0$ which would both be in $T$ (because it is a sequence of 0s and 1s which is by the definition of $T$ in $T$ ) and at the same time not in $T$ (because we can deliberately construct it not to be in the list). $T$ , containing all such sequences, must contain $s_0$ , which is just such a sequence. But since $s_0$ does not appear anywhere on the list, $T$ cannot contain $s_0$ . Therefore $T$ cannot be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. In other words, it is uncountable. I'm not sure this definition is correct, because if we assume that $m = (1, \dots)$ , then this definition says that "" $s_n$ is equal to itself""&mdadshthere is no ""diagonalization"" in this particular description of the argument, nor does it incorporate the ""flipping"" part of the argument, never mind the fact that we have very clearly constructed just such an impossible $T$ list above.  An attempt to correct the ""diagonalization"" and ""flipping"" problem: $$s_n = (\lnot s_{m,m}, \lnot s_{m,m}, \dots) \quad \text{where $m$ is the element index and} \quad\begin{equation}\lnot s_{m,m} = \begin{cases}0 & \mathrm{if\ } s_{m,m} = 1\\1 & \mathrm{if\ } s_{m,m} = 0\end{cases}\end{equation}$$ This definition doesn't quite work either, as we immediately run in to problems with just $s_1 = (0),$ which is impossible because by definition $s_1$ must be $ = (1)$ if $s_1 = (0)$ , which would also be impossible because... it's turtles all the way down!? Or more generally, with the revised definition there is a contradiction whenever $n = m$ , which would seem to invalidate the revised formulation of the argument / proof. Nothing about this argument / proof makes any sense to me, nor why it only applies to real numbers and makes them ""uncountable"". As near as I can tell it would seem to apply equal well to natural numbers, which are ""countable"". What am I missing?",['elementary-set-theory']
39283,What is the deepest / most interesting known connection between Trigonometry and Statistics?,"I'm teaching both at the same time to different classes in high school, so I just wondered about this. Added by OP on 16.May.2011 (Beijing time) I mean Statistics only, without Probability. In other words, Descriptive Statistics only. This rules out Buffon’s Needle Problem. The occurrence of π is counted only as a connection to geometry. By Trigonometry is meant explicit, non-gratuitous, occurrence of the sine, cosine, tangent, or their reciprocals. Yes, the Law of Cosines fits the bill, but it is on the surface: everyone knows about it. It would be a hugely interesting meta theorem that this were the “deepest” connection between Trigonometry and Descriptive Statistics. My suspicion/hope is that there are deeper connections, somewhat along the line of the surprising use of trig in solving the cubic in closed form, or the use of trigonometric substitutions in evaluating certain integrals. The comment below about the arcsine transformation at first blush seems to be something along this line, but when you follow the link you see that someone is bringing it up only to say how bad it is. So, I hope the intent of my question is now much clearer.","['statistics', 'trigonometry', 'big-list', 'soft-question']"
