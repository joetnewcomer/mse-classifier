655593,Polar Integral Confusion,"Yet again, a friend of mine asked for help with a polar integral, we both got the same answer, the book again gave a different answer. Question Use a polar integral to find the area inside the circle $r=4 \sin \theta$ and outside $r=2$. Proposed Solution We see that the two circles intersect at $ \pm \frac{\pi}{6}$. Because of the symmetry of the region, we may write $$2 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{6}} \int_{2}^{4 \sin \theta} r  \, \,dr d\theta $$ and equivalently $$2 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{6}} 8 \sin^2 \theta - 2 \, \,d\theta$$ and finally $$-4 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{6}} 2\cos 2\theta -1 \, \,d\theta$$ 
Which is $\frac{2}{3} ( \pi - 3\sqrt{3})$. The book gives an answer of $\frac{2}{3} ( 2\pi - 3\sqrt{3})$, the same as evaluating the integral from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Which answer is correct?","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates', 'integration']"
655594,"How to prove that max{$X_1$,...,$X_n$} is a sufficient statistic for $b$ in the Uniform distribution on$ [a,b]$","I am having a bit of difficulty with the following: I have the Uniform distribution on [a,b] where a is known and b is unknown and $b>a$, I'd like to show that the $T=max$($X_1$,...,$X_n$) is a sufficient statistic for $b$. Here is my proof: Since for any $x_i$$<0$, $f_n$($\vec{x}$,$b$)= $0$, we only look at the case where $x_i$$\geq$$0$: We have: $f_n$($\vec{x}$,$b$)= $(1/(b-a))^n$ for $t$$\leq$$b$ and 
0 otherwise, As a result, let $h(t,b)$$=$$f_n$($\vec{x}$,$b$)= $(1/(b-a))^n$ for $t$$\leq$$b$ and 
0 otherwise, Then, let $u(x)$$=$$1$. Since we can write $f_n$($\vec{x}$,$b$) = $h(t,b)$$u(x)$, then T is a sufficient statistic. However, I have seen in other places that the right answer is to let write the likelihood as: $f_n$($\vec{x}$,$b$) = $\frac{h(t,b)}{(b-a)^n}$ where here I have no idea what $h(t,b)$ should be.

655634,Question about Axler's proof that every linear operator has an eigenvalue,"I am puzzled by Sheldon Axler's proof that every linear operator on a finite dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue (theorem 5.10 in ""Linear Algebra Done Right"").  In particular, it's his maneuver in the last set of displayed equations where he substitutes the linear operator $T$ for the complex variable $z$.  See below. What principle allows Axler to make this substitution of linear operator for complex variable and still claim that the RHS equals the LHS, and that the LHS goes from being the number zero (in the preceding set of equations) to the zero vector (in the final set of equations)? As a possible answer to my own question, on the preceding page he offers these remarks: Is linearity of the map from ""polynomial over complex variable"" to ""polynomial over T"" the property that makes this work?  If so, I don't feel very enlightened.  Any further insight here is greatly appreciated, especially since Axler makes a side comment that this proof is much clearer than the usual proof via the determinant.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
655667,Arbitrary dimensional object with constant ratio of volume to containing hyper cube's volume?,"Let me introduce what I need by giving an example which is not working: n-sphere with radius 1 and respective hypercube with edges of length 2.
The ratio reaches already in 10th dimension a level of less than 1%. My question essentially is whether a geometric object G with following features exists : The hyper-cube containing G is canonically defined for all dimensions with edges of length L and center is the 0. G is contained in above hyper-cube for all dimensions. The ratio of the G's volume and the hyper-cubes volume is constant over all dimensions. Calculating whether a point chosen from the hyper-cube uniformly at random is contained in G is canonical. (in other words: the calculation can be written down as a single formula depending on the number of dimensions and of course L and the point) Any path along the surface of G is differentiable. The volume ratio should be either adjustable or between .2 and .8. (point 5 is maybe not correctly formulated. I want to make sure that G is not ""edgy""/""weird"" (sorry for these terms). Maybe it is the same as when I request G to be Riemann integrable) I need such an object to generate a sample data set from an arbitrary dimensional space to benchmark performance of SVMs (and other ML algorithms) over dimensionality of input space.",['differential-geometry']
655686,Intuition behind smooth functions.,"Smooth functions $f(t)$ are those such that $\frac{d^nf(t)}{dt^n}$ exists for all $n\in\Bbb{N}$. I understand the intuition behind smoothness for functions like $f(t)=| t|$ and $f(t)=\sqrt{t}$. $f(t)$ has a ""sharp"" (and hence non-smooth) turn at $t=0$. Similarly, $f(t)=\sqrt{t}$ ends abruptly at $t=0$ (and hence is not ""smooth""). However, functions like $f(t)=t^{\frac{1}{3}}$ seem ""smooth"" enough to me! Why does the intuitive understanding of smoothness fail here? Is this just another case of extending a definition of a term to non-intuitive cases? Thanks in advance!",['differential-geometry']
655718,Why is this inclusion of dual of Banach spaces wrong?,"Ive been struggling the last days on this paradox, please I need help! Let
$$E\subset F$$
be two Banach spaces equipped with the same norm. Some people told me that
$$F^* \subset E^*$$

Let $t_i:F^*\to E^*$ be defined as the restriction of the functionals of $F^*$ on $E$, this $t_i$ is surjective so $E^*$ is smaller than $F^*$ thus the inclusion cannot hold). However, their proof for the inclusion $F^*\subset E^*$ is : let $T\in F^*$, $T$ is defined on $F$ thus on $E$, it is linear and continuous on $E$, therefore, $T\in E^*$. 1) What is wrong in their proof? It seems so true! 2) Is $E^*\subset F^*$? And then what the inclusion ""$\subset$"" would mean? (because if $T\in E^*$, it is not direct to make it belong to $F^*$!)

655857,Making cuts on a spiral so that all segments are of the same length,Imagine a roll of magnetic strip (about 2 cm in width) which is rolled in a roll of about 30 windings and about 10m length. The strip is about 2cm in width. The roll is put on a Rod which the user unwinds by hand and with a knife he cuts segments of about 5 cm in length. Another way of doing this would be to perform the cuts directly on the roll. The issue is that the inner windings are smaller than the outside windings thus if we make the cuts directly on the roll we come up with different length segments all around. Is their a geometrically correct way of making the cuts so that all segments will come out the same length? This is a naive visualisation of the cuts; naturally the segments will come out in different lengths as we approach the centre of the spiral. And this is how the user cuts them up until now: There should be a mathematic formula which dictates where to make the cuts directly on the spiral(the roll) so all segments comes out at the same length.,['geometry']

Now B knows A's strategy, and will uses another strategy, and so on. So, before even playing the game for once, there is an infinite chain of strategies which A and B choose successively!

Link to the previous question. So lately I thought a bit about quite a related question. Assume we are given the category of finite groups (or easier case: finite abelian groups), but with the names of all objects covered (i.e. we don't know which object is which). Can we rediscover the objects by knowing a) only the cardinality of all the $Hom$-Sets associated to the objects b) the categorical structure (i.e. we know the $Hom$-Sets and how morphisms compose with each other) In the Situation b) (which is of course more difficult than a) ), I am quite optimistic this is possible at least for abelian finite groups (something like let $A$ be such that there are no epis $A \rightarrow B$ for $0 \neq B \neq A$, then $A$ is cyclic of prime order. But then $A= \mathbb{Z}/(|Hom(A,A)|)\mathbb{Z}$. Now by induction we should be able to rediscover higher order cyclic groups and as we know the categorial structure, we should also know coproducts) However, the case that is closer to the link above is situation a) and I have absolutely no idea whether this could be possible or not. (For example we can obviously rediscover $0$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, but I don't see how to move on) Maybe I should also note that of course the situation is quite different than in the original question: now we know a lot ""more"" $Hom$-sets, but we don't a priori know which objects they arise from.

656283,"Intuitively, why is the Euler-Mascheroni constant near $\sqrt{1/3}$?","Questions that ask for ""intuitive"" reasons are admittedly subjective, but I suspect some people will find this interesting. Some time ago, I was struck by the coincidence that the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma$ is close to the square root of $1/3$ . (Their numerical values are about $0.57722$ and $0.57735$ respectively.) Is there any informal or intuitive reason for this? For example, can we find a series converging to $\gamma$ and a series converging to $\sqrt{1/3}$ whose terms are close to each other? An example of the kind of argument I have in mind can be found in Noam Elkies' list of one-page papers , where he gives a ""reason"" that $\pi$ is slightly less than $\sqrt{10}$ . (Essentially, take $\sum\frac1{n^2}=\pi^2/6$ as known, and then bound that series above by a telescoping series whose sum is $10/6$ .) There are lots of ways to get series that converge quickly to $\sqrt{1/3}$ . For example, taking advantage of the fact that $(4/7)^2\approx1/3$ , we can write $$
\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}=(\frac{16}{48})^{1/2}
=(\frac{16}{49}\cdot\frac{49}{48})^{1/2}=\frac{4}{7}(1+\frac{1}{48})^{1/2}
$$ which we can expand as a binomial series, so $\frac{4}{7}\cdot\frac{97}{96}$ is an example of a good approximation to $\sqrt{1/3}$ . Can we also get good approximations to $\gamma$ by using series that converge quickly, and can we find the ""right"" pair of series that shows ""why"" $\gamma$ is slightly less than $\sqrt{1/3}$ ? Another type of argument that's out there , showing ""why"" $\pi$ is slightly less than $22/7$ , involves a particular definite integral of a ""small"" function that evaluates to $\frac{22}{7}-\pi$ .

If we consider the case $\rho_{0} = 1$, then the integral $(1)$ can be explicitly worked out and leads to $\rho_{\infty} (r) = \text{argch} \left(\frac{a}{r}\right) $. One should note that in this situation, $\rho_{\infty}$ is also a $\textit{smooth}$ function on $]0,a]$. As $\rho_{\infty}$ in my situation appears to be $\textit{smooth}$, I want to estimate its derivative. Forgetting about the conditions of applicability of the theorem about differentiation under the integral, one can rewrite $\rho_{\infty}$ under the form $$ \rho_{\infty} (r) = \int_{r}^{a} f (r_{0},r) \, d r_{0} $$ so that naively, its derivative should be given by $\rho_{\infty} \overset{?}{=} \int_{r}^{a} \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} d r_{0} - 1 \cdot f (r_{0},r)$. However, this leads to an undefined expression, since both of these terms are infinite. My question is the following one. As $\rho_{\infty}$ is a $\textit{smooth}$ function, its derivative exists. But, how should I proceed to estimate $\frac{d \rho_{\infty}}{d r}$ in terms of $\rho_{0}$ ? $\textbf{Bonus question}$ In fact, my final aim would be to $\textit{invert}$ the equation $(1)$, in order to express $\rho_{0}$ as a function of $\rho_{\infty}$.

Thus my question is: are there any topological conditions on a subset of the reals which implies it is not measurable?

Now let $X_t^N$ be the proportion of corridors which remain empty at time $t$ and $T^N$ the time until half of the corridors have at least one customer, then it holds that $X_t^N\rightarrow e^{-t}, T^N\rightarrow \log 2$ for $N\rightarrow \infty$ in probability. Well I started step by step. Let $X$ be the RV that describes the number customers that arrived, then we know $P(X=k)=\frac{N^k e^{-N}}{N!}$. I denote each customer with a number so $P$(customer i chooses some corridor)$=\frac{1}{N}$. How can I continue?","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
656542,The functor $\underline{\mathbf{R}}^if_*$,"Let $f: X \to Y$ be a proper morhpism of varieties, and $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf on $X$.

Moreover, we have another functor $\underline{\mathbf{R}} f_*$ which is the derived functor between derived categories of complex of sheaves (here $\mathcal{F}$ viewed as a complex in degree $0$): $$\underline{\mathbf{R}} f_* : D(X) \to D(Y).$$ Then what is the usual meaning of $\underline{\mathbf{R}}^i f_*(\mathcal F)$? Here are two possible understandings: (1) $\underline{\mathbf{R}}^i f_*(\mathcal F)$ is a SHEAF which is the $i$-th cohomology of $\mathbf{R} f_*(\mathcal F)$ (I feel that this is the common convention) (2) Using the functor $\mathbf{R}^i f_*$ (this is not the left exact functor) to define the derived functor between derived categories $D(X) \to D(Y)$.

Thus $E[X]E[Y] = \frac{7}{4}$. I'm aware that the expectation of $XY$ is not multiplicative, i.e.: $E[X]E[Y]$ is not necessarily equal to $E[XY]$. But I'm confused about what $E[XY]$ means in the first place. That is, is $E[XY]$ each possible value of the two events combined, multiplied by the probability that the two events occur? That is, is $E[XY] = \frac{1}{2}(1)\sum_{k=1}^{6}{\frac{k}{6}} + \frac{1}{2}(0)\sum_{k=1}^{6}{\frac{k}{6}} = \frac{7}{4}$? If not, what is it?

Has $f$ absolute extrema in $D=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2\leq 1\}$?.

I'm considering the possibility of study the existence of critical points inside $D$ (when $x^2+y^2<1$) and for the boundary of $D$ separately, but for the last I'd use Lagrange multipliers and the calculations I'm doing doesn't seem right. I have $\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}= \displaystyle\frac{2y^{1/3}}{3(x^2y)^{2/3}}=\displaystyle\frac{2y^{1/3}}{3x^{1/3}}$ and $\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}= \displaystyle\frac{x^2}{3(x^2y)^{2/3}}=\displaystyle\frac{x^{2/3}}{3y^{2/3}}$.

It follows directly from, say, Rouché's theorem . For an elementary proof, see Michael Artin's Algebra , proposition 5.2.1(b). A sharper proposition of the original problem , i.e. replacing the real parameter $t\in\mathbb R$ with a complex parameter $w\in\mathbb C$, is generally demonstrably false, i.e. there could be no continuous function to be a root of the polynomial. Here's a simple counterexample: $f^{(w)}(z)=z^2-w$. Note that there's a branch point at $w=0$, and if we draw an arbitrary circle around the origin in the $w$-plane, we'll see that a root shouldn't be continuous on the whole $w$-plane $\mathbb C$, for otherwise letting $w$ travel the circle would lead to a contradiction. It seems true when $t$ is a real parameter, since the dimension is lower. I have no idea how to attack this. I expect your grateful ideas or hints. Thanks!

656927,Convergent sequence in product space on $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$,"I am confused about the concept of convergent sequence in product space when learning Munkres's Topology, especially when I am comparing two related exercises of it. The exercise 6 of section 19 titled ""The Product Topology"" considers the convergent sequence in product space (its solution can be found at Convergence in product topology ): Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of the points of the product space $\Pi X_{\alpha}$. (show that) This sequence converges to the point $x$ if and only if the sequence $\pi_{\alpha}(x_1), \pi_{\alpha}(x_2), \ldots$ converges to $\pi_{\alpha}(x)$ for each $\alpha$. The exercise 4(b) of section 20 titled ""The Metric Topology"" considers convergent sequence in product space on $R^{\omega}$ (the hint of its solution can be found at Convergence of sequence in uniform and box topologies ). Consider, for instance, the sequence $w_1 = (1,1,1,1,\ldots), w_2 = (0,2,2,2,\ldots), w_3 = (0,0,3,3,\ldots), \ldots$ The $w$ sequence converges to the ""zero"" point, i.e., $0 = (0,0,0,0, \ldots)$ in product space on $R^{\omega}$ because $D(0, w_k) = 1 / k$, and therefore, any ball $B_{D}(0, \epsilon)$ contains all elements of the sequence starting from some large enough index.
Moreover, we can check that the sequence $\pi_{\alpha}(w_1), \pi_{\alpha}(w_2), \ldots$ converges to $\pi_{\alpha}(0)$ for each $\alpha$. In other words, for the $w$ sequence, the statement of exercise 6 is satisfied. However, is it generally true for the sequence in product space on $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$? Formally, Problem: Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of the points of the product space on $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$. Is it true that this sequence converges to the point $x$ if and only if the sequence $\pi_{\alpha}(x_1), \pi_{\alpha}(x_2), \ldots$ converges to $\pi_{\alpha}(x)$ for each $\alpha$?","['general-topology', 'convergence-divergence', 'metric-spaces']"

656936,problem requires condition probability,"Q. A robot fires 3 shots at a moving target. For the first shot, the probability of hitting the moving target is 1/3. For subsequent shots beyond the first shot, the probability of hitting the moving target is 1/2 if the previous shot is a hit (for example, the probability of hitting the moving target on the 3rd shot is 1/2 if the 2nd shot is a hit) and the probability of hitting the moving target is 1/4 if the previous shot is a miss. What is the mean and variance of the number of hits? I understand that we can draw a probability tree diagram and find out the possibility of each case, but what i don't understand is how to calculate mean for the number of hits. some kind of hint would be really helpful",['probability']
656965,Proof of the Usual Topology on R,"I'm trying to prove that the usual topology on R is in fact a topology for R. I've read through a few books on topology and most of them seem to skip over the proof and list it as ""trivial"". My math skills are obviously lacking because I'm stumped! I'm trying to prove the following three things: That R and the empty set are elements of the usual topology That the union of any two elements is an element of the usual topology That the intersection of any two elements is an element of the usual topology Of these, 3 to me seems the easiest to prove because if two elements don't overlap, the answer is the empty set, otherwise it is given by the interval that the two elements overlap. I'm having a few issues with 1 and 2 though. Specifically: Why is the empty set in the usual topology? I can't find a value x in R or e > 0 such that the empty set = x +- e? Likewise, why is R in the usual topology? For example, take x = 0 and e = (abstractly) ""the biggest number in R"". Then we have the interval from -""the biggest number"" to +""the biggest number"", but by definition that cannot include ""the biggest number"" so isn't R? By this logic, it seems that maybe a better definition for the usual topology is not only all intervals in R, but also R and the empty set as well? Lastly, I'm struggling to prove that the union of two elements is also in the usual topology. Consider the intervals (1, 2) and (3, 4). The union of these two isn't an interval, hence shouldn't be a part of the usual topology? Now obviously several centuries worth of mathematicians are going to be vastly more correct than me (and that's something I can actually prove!) so my big question is... where am I going wrong? Is it in my understanding of the usual topology, of topologies in general or in my logic? Thanks! EDIT: Sorry, I should have mentioned the definition of ""usual topology"". The usual topology T is defined such that that O is an element of T if and only if for all x in O there exists an e > 0 such that the interval (x - e, x + e) is a subset of O.","['general-topology', 'analysis']"
656980,What's the distribution of the exponential of uniformly distributed variable?,"I want to know the distribution of $z = \exp(j\varphi)$, with $\varphi \sim \mathcal{U}[-\pi;+\pi]$. From the book ""Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes"" by Papoulis and Pillai I figured the following: If $y=g(x)$ is a function of random variable $x$ with the density function $f_x(x)$, one can retrieve the density function $f_y(y)$ of $y$ by $f_y(y)=f_x(x)/|g'(x)|$. Therefore, if $g(x)=y=exp(x)$, this yields $f_y(y)=f_x(ln(y))/|exp(x)|$. In my case with $f_x(x)$ being a uniform distribution. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out yet how to include this uniform distribution into the equation and even more important how to transfer the solution to complex variables.","['statistics', 'uniform-distribution', 'probability-distributions', 'random-variables']"
657000,Understanding the definition of the order of an entire function in Ahlfors's Complex Analysis,"Let $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ be an entire function. The order of $f$ is defined by $$\lambda=\limsup_{r \to \infty} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}, $$ where $$M(r)=\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)| .$$ Ahlfors in his Complex Analysis claims that ""According to this definition $\lambda$ is the smallest number such that
      $$M(r)\leq e^{r^{\lambda+\varepsilon}} $$ for any given $\varepsilon > 0$ as soon as $r$ is sufficiently large."" Why is this true? My attempt: We know that $$\lambda=\lim_{\rho \to \infty} \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}. $$ From the definition of the limit we have that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists some $\rho_0>0$, such that $$\left\lvert \sup_{r \geq \rho} \frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r}-\lambda \right\rvert \leq \varepsilon ,$$ for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$. In other words $$\frac{\log \log M(r)}{\log r} \leq \lambda+\varepsilon $$ for every $r \geq \rho_0$. From here it is easy to see that $$M(r)\leq e^{r^{\lambda+\varepsilon}}, $$ for all $r \geq \rho_0$. I cannot see why $\lambda$ is the smallest number with this property.

 $ut + t + 1$ are both prime. So we get a solution of the equation $$au - b(u+1) = -1$$ with prime numbers $a$ and $b$ by setting $a := ut + t + 1 , b := ut + 1$ : $$(ut+t+1)u - (ut+1)(u+1) = u^2t+ut+u-u^2t-ut-u-1 = -1$$ Motivation : If the conjecture is true, then for any natural number $n$, there is a pair
 $(a,a+1)$ of consecutive squarefree numbers with exactly $n$ distinct prime
 factors. I checked the conjecture with PARI and for $u\le10^6$, it is true.
