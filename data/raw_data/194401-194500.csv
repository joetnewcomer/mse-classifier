How to show that f has at least two zeros?","$f:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ is a countinous function. $$\int_0^1f(x) dx =0 \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad \int_0^1xf(x) dx =0. $$ If $f \ge 0$ ( $f\le0$ ) were true then $\int_0^1f(x) dx \ge0$ ( $\int_0^1f(x) dx \le0$ ). This is a contradiction, we can conclude that $f$ changes sign. By intermediate value property there exist a point $c$ such that $f(c)=0$ . This is the first zero. By using mean value theorems for integrals I can also show that a zero does exist. I can't show that these zeroes are different from each other.

3736399,"Compact Kähler manifolds with $dim_\mathbb{C}H^{1,1}(X)=1$","In Wells's book 《differential analysis on complex manifolds》 page219, there is a statement:"" any compact Kähler manifold $X$ with the property that  dim $_\mathbb{C}H^{1,1}(X)=1$ is necessarily Hodge.

3736494,"When writing $\int_{1}^{x}x^2dx$, is $x$ a variable or a constant?","If the $x$ in $\int_{1}^{x}x^2dx$ is a constant, then the way in which people evaluate it doesn't make sense to me. For example, say $x=5$ , then intuitively I would think of the integral as being the same as $$
\int_{1}^{5}5^2=\left[25x\right]_{1}^{5}=25(5)-25(1)=25(4)=100
$$ However, this does not give the correct answer. Presumably, this is because we are looking at the area under of the graph of $y=x^2$ , rather than the graph of $y=25$ . However, if this is the case, then it seems $x$ is being treated as both a variable and a constant: a constant in the sense that it is one of the fixed bounds of integration; and a variable in the sense that we are looking at the $y-$ values as $x$ changes. Putting these two together, it seems like $x$ is going from $1$ to $x$ , which doesn't make sense to me. It also seems that people try to get around this problem in a number of ways. The natural logarithm is defined as $$
\ln(x)=\int_{1}^{x}\frac{1}{t}dt
$$ If it is correct to write $\int_{1}^{x}x^2dx$ , then why don't we defined the natural logarithm as $$

3736658,On the proximity of $a\sqrt b+b\sqrt a$ to an integer,"Let $\Sigma$ denote all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of positive, square-free integers with $a> b$ .

Note that if $x$ has irrationality measure $\mu$ then $\mu$ is the infimum such that $$0<\left|x-\frac pq\right|<\frac1{q^{\mu}}$$ has finitely many solutions for $p,q$ integers. Here, the problem can be rephrased as determining $\kappa$ such that, $$0<\left|a\sqrt b+b\sqrt a-K\right|<\frac1{(ab)^\kappa}$$ has finitely many solutions for an integer $K(a,b)$ which is either $\lfloor a\sqrt b+b\sqrt a\rfloor$ or $\lceil a\sqrt b+b\sqrt a\rceil$ .

3736674,Derivative of the complex norm as commonly used in physics,"On the one hand, I read that the derivative of the complex conjugate $C[z]=\overline{z}$ is not differentiable anywhere (for instance see here ). (see 1, below) On the other hand, I see in physics taking the derivative of a complex scalar field to obtain the equation of motion using the Euler-Lagrange method (for instance see enter link description here (see 2, below) So which is it, can we or can we not take the derivative? For case 1, the reference states that a complex function is differentiable if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$
f[z]=f[x+iy]=u[x,y]+iv[x,y]
$$ Then f is differentiable if $$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} =-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
$$ Then for the complex conjugate $C[x+iy]=x-iy$ then $\partial u/\partial x =1$ and $\partial v/\partial y=-1$ . Consequently $C[z]=\overline{z}$ is not differentiable anywhere in the complex plane. For case 2, the physics paper defines the Lagrangian of a complex scalar free field as follows: $$
\mathcal{L}=(\partial \phi^*)(\partial \phi)

\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial \phi)}=\partial \phi^*\\

3736802,Closest matrix that achieves positive semidefinite condition,"Suppose we have two symmetric positive semidefinite $n$ dimensional matrices $A$ and $B$ . We use the notation $X\leq Y$ means that $Y-X$ is positive semidefinite. Suppose $A \not\leq B$ i.e. $B-A$ has at least one negative eigenvalue. We are interested in perturbing $A$ to some positive semidefinite $\tilde{A}$ such that $\tilde{A} \leq B$ while minimizing $|A-\tilde{A}|_1$ where $|\cdot|_1$ is the nuclear norm and defined by $$|X|_1 := \text{Tr} \left( \sqrt{X^\dagger X} \right)$$ and $X^\dagger$ is the transpose conjugate of $X$ . To make things simpler, I will now consider the case where $A$ is a rank- $1$ matrix. Is it true that $$\tilde{A} = \lambda A$$ for some $\lambda < 1$ ? An immediate corollary is that $\tilde{A}\leq A$ . EDIT: After a bit of searching, I found a result for the same question but where the norm considered is the induced 2-norm (spectral norm) or the Frobenius norm. For the induced 2-norm (spectral norm), it holds that $\tilde{A} = A - \lambda I$ where $\lambda$ is the smallest positive number such that $\tilde{A}\leq B$ is true. So for this case, my conjecture that $\tilde{A} = \lambda A$ is false but the statement $\tilde{A}\leq A$ is true. For the Frobenius norm case, we first write the polar decomposition of $B-A = UH$ . Then $B -\tilde{A} = \frac{1}{2}(B - A + H)$ is the solution. Since $H= ((B-A)^\dagger(B-A))^{1/2}\geq B-A$ , one can again conclude that $\tilde{A}\leq A$ I do not know what happens for the 1-norm though. EDIT 2: Here is another look at the problem that almost works. Suppose the solution $\tilde{A}\not\leq A$ . We prove that there exists some $A'$ such that $A'\leq B, A'\leq A$ and $|A'-A|_1\leq|\tilde{A}-A|_1$ . Let us diagonalize $\tilde{A}-A = ZDZ^\dagger = ZD^{+}Z^\dagger + ZD^{-}Z^\dagger$ where $D$ is diagonal, $D^{\pm}$ is also diagonal and includes the nonnegative and negative eigenvalues respectively. By assumption $\tilde{A}\leq B \implies A + ZD^{+}Z^\dagger + ZD^{-}Z^\dagger \leq B$ . Define $A':= A + ZD^{-}Z^\dagger$ . Since $ZD^{+}Z^\dagger$ is positive semidefinite, it holds that $A' = A + ZD^{-}Z^\dagger \leq B$ . Since $ZD^{-}Z^\dagger$ is negative definite, it follows that $A'\leq A$ . Finally, $|A' - A|_1 = |ZD^{-}Z^\dagger|_1 = |D^{-}|_1 \leq |D^{+}+D^{-}|_1 =  |Z(D^{+}+D^{-})Z^\dagger|_1 = |\tilde{A} - A|_1$ EDIT 3 Unfortunately, the $A'$ constructed is not positive semidefinite in general.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'positive-semidefinite', 'nuclear-norm']"

3736901,Understanding the tensor product of functions/maps,"Let $K^A = \{f \,|\, f\colon A \longrightarrow K\}$ be the set of functions from $A$ (some arbitrary set) to $K$ (a field, I guess, I want to be able to call $K^A$ a $K$ -vector space). Given some other set $A'$ I'd like to know when can we say $$K^A\otimes K^{A'} \subseteq K^{A\times A'}$$ and when can we say they're equal, or when is this true for subalgebras (like $C^\infty(A)$ , $L^2_\mu(A)$ or $A^* = \mathrm{Hom}(A;K)$ , for instance, depending on the structure $A$ has). The tensor product of functions would be define so that $$(f\otimes g)(x,y) = f(x)g(y).$$ I tried doing some research and piecing together what I've learnt so far. Most resources don't talk about purely algebraic vector spaces, though, and I don't know much about Banach spaces, functional analysis or real-variable analysis and it's being a little hard. For the case of linear forms (so $A,A'$ are $K$ -vector spaces) it is true that their tensor product yields a ""bilinear form"" $A\times A'\longrightarrow K$ , so $A^*\otimes A'^* \equiv \mathrm{Bil}(A,A';K)$ . It can't be true in general, because rank-1 elements of the tensor product correspond to (product-wise) separable functions and not every function is a linear combination of separable functions. For example, the function $\delta\colon \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined to be $0$ everywhere except $1$ wherever $x = y$ is not a linear combination of separable functions. For $L^2(A)$ , at least when $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n,A'\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ with the Lebesgue measure, it isn't true that $$L^2(A)\otimes L^2(A') = L^2(A\times A')$$ but it is true if we use the ""Hilbert"" tensor product (the closure of the usual tensor product with respect to the topology induced by the metric). This is because the topology of the Hilbert space allows for ""infinite linear combinations"" to make sense whenever they're convergent. I know this question might be too broad (sorry!), but I'm sure there's some concept to know or reference to read from which I could learn more about this.","['tensor-products', 'multilinear-algebra', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

3737306,Maximum Principle for Minimal Surface Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Condition,"I'm an undergraduate student and I'm currently reading a classical paper for my final project for the course differential geometry on the Bernstein problem of minimal surfaces, namely, the paper: Bombieri, Enrico, E. De Giorgi, and Enrico Giusti, "" Minimal Cones and the Bernstein Problem "" Inventiones Mathematicae 7.3 (1969): 243-268. In equation \eqref{1}, the authors considered the folowing Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation: $$
\begin{cases}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( D_i \left( \dfrac{D_i f}{\sqrt{1+\vert D f \vert^2}} \right) \right) = 0, \qquad f\in C^2(B_R), \\
    f=f_1\quad  \text{in} \quad \partial B_R
\end{cases}\label{1}\tag{25}
$$ where $B_R$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^8$ . ( NOT in three-dimensional Euclidean space ) We have known the existence and uniqueness of the solution of such a boundary problem. Denote its solution by $f^{(R)}(x)$ . Similarly, we consider the same boundary problem with function $f_2$ on $\partial B_R$ . With some assumptions and calculations mentioned in the paper before, we have obtained that $$
f_1(x) \leq f^{(R)}(x) \leq f_2(x)
$$ on the boundary $\partial(B_R \cap D_1)$ . Here comes my question which has been puzzling me for a long time: The authors claims that: ""by the well-known maximum principle for solutions of the Dirichlet problem and equation \eqref{2} and \eqref{3}"" (listed below), we obtained that $$
f_1(x) \leq f^{(R)}(x) \leq f_2(x) \, \text{for} \,  x \in \bar{B}_R\cap\bar{D_1}.
$$ I'm confused at the ""maximum principle mentioned there. I have learned the strong maximum principle and the Hopf maximum principle for Laplacian equations (with corresponding boundary conditions), but I have no idea how to apply these here. Or, it there any maximum principle stated for the minimal surface equation in the above contexts? I tried but find no reference for such a theorem. (For example, the book on elliptic PDEs by David Gilbarg, et.al). Moreover, I have no idea on the role played by the equation \eqref{2} and \eqref{3}. P.S.

There is one way in ""2001Probability laws related to the Jacobi theta and Riemann zeta functions, and Brownian excursions"", through $L_{X_C}$ . However, that paper mentions reciprocal property between $X_C$ and $X_C$ and between $X_S$ and $X_C$ , which I do not understand. In particular, since $\int_0^\infty e^{-sx}e^{-ax}dx=\frac{1}{s+a}$ for $a>0$ , directly applying Laplace transform to densities may lead to divergent series, e.g., $\sum_{k=1}^\infty(-1)^{k+1}\frac{k^2 \pi^2 }{s+\frac{1}{2}k^2\pi^2}$ .

Firstly I make the substitution $y = A^2$ , this reduces the equation to $y'' = 2 \alpha y -2\sqrt{y}.$ Since the equation is lacking the independent variable $x$ , one may make the substitution $y'=v$ which reduces the equation to $ v \frac{dv}{dy} = 2\alpha y - 2\sqrt{y}.$ By seperating variables, and using $y'=v$ , one has: $$ y' = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot\sqrt{C+3\alpha y^2 - 4 y^{1.5}}.$$ for some integration constant $C$ . This is as far as I've got without rurnning in to problems. I am not able to get this down to an explicit form.

Question 3: Are there any other methods that could be applied to solve this, or to at least find some information about the solution? I'm not sure if you could apply asymptotics as it's a BVP on a finite interval. EDIT 1: You can use $y'(0) = 0$ to get rid of the $C$ in the above equation. You can the substitute A^2 straight back in to the equation for $y'$ to give: $$ 2A\cdot A' = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\cdot A \cdot \sqrt{3\alpha A^2 - 4A} \implies A' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \sqrt{3\alpha A^2 - 4A}$$ Which, according to matlab, has the solution: $$A(x) =  -\frac{1}{3\alpha}\cdot\bigg\{2\cos\bigg[\frac{\sqrt{3\alpha}}{6}\bigg(C_1+x\sqrt{6}\bigg)\cdot \int_0^x \frac{1}{ln(t)}dt\bigg]-2\bigg\}$$ If anyone would like to point out any floors I've made it would be much appreciative!

3737705,Is there an optimal strategy for this game of card?,"This game is based on the concept of minimizing resource wastage. The Game Cards which do not have numbers are not used e.g. ace, king, queen, joker. For the remaining cards, regardless of the color and shape, the value of a card is equal to the number on it. The cards are shuffled and distributed between the two players. They get equal number of cards. In each round, both player pick a card a place it upside down on the table without showing the opponent to complete their moves. After this they show their cards to each other. The player with the bigger number on the card win the round. The points won by the round winner for this round is equal to the number on card played by the losing players card in this round. E.g if $A$ plays $6$ and $B$ plays $1$ in this round then $A$ wins the round and gets $1$ point. If the number on both cards are equal than the round is a draw and the game continues until someone wins the round or all the cards are used. The round winner get the points equal to the number on the last card played by the round loser. After a round is completed, the played cards are discarded and the game continues with the unused cards remaining with each player until all the cards are used At the end, the player with the greater sum of points win the game. Minimizing wastage : Clearly we want to win a round by using the smallest card. E.g. if $B$ plays $1$ then $A$ will win the round and get $1$ point if he/she puts any card from $2$ to $10$ . But playing a $10$ to win $1$ point is a waste as $10$ can be played to win against bigger numbers later in the match. However before showing, neither player knows what card was played by the opponent. One may argue that if a player uses up the big cards in the beginning to make small win, it may leave him/her weaker in the later rounds. But using bigger cards in the beginning, leaves the player with smaller cards which leaves the opponent less scope to win more points. Question : Is there a mathematically optimal strategy that maximizes the chances of winning?

3737884,Definition of gradient in a Riemannian manifold.,"I was doing exercise 8 from do Carmo's Riemannian geometry and I stumbled upon the definition of gradient given. Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold... $f \in \mathcal{D}(M)$ .. the gradient of $f$ as a vector field $\text{grad} \; f$ on $M$ defined by $$
\langle \text{grad} \; f, v \rangle = df_p(v) \;\; p \in M, v \in T_pM \;\;\;\;\; (1)
$$ here $\langle \cdot , \cdot\rangle$ is the Riemannian metric on $M$ and $f$ is a differentiable function on $M$ . No the Riemannian metric is a bilinear map $$\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle : T_p M \times T_p M \to \mathbb{R}$$ but the differential $df_p$ is a map between tangent spaces, namely $$
df_p : T_p M \to T_{f(p)} \mathbb{R} \cong \mathbb{R}
$$ So in a nutshell I'm confused about the equality in $(1)$ because the lhs is a scalar in the field while the rhs is vector, though isomorphic to the scalar field. This definition actually makes a bit tricky for me to understand how to do the exercises, because any of the computations I do give me equalities that don't really make sense.

I trying to prove this so I could conclude that operator of the form $(\hat{f}\cdot m)^\vee$ maps $\mathcal{S}$ to it self. Attempt: Given $\alpha, \beta$ multi-index, we have to prove that $$\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R^n}}|x^\alpha\partial^\beta(\hat{f}\cdot m)^\vee(x)| < \infty. $$ When $\alpha = 0$ , using some properties of Fourier tranform, we get $$\partial^\beta(\hat{f}\cdot m)^\vee(x) = ((2\pi i \xi)^\beta\hat{f}(\xi)m(\xi))^\vee(x) = ((\partial^\beta f)^\wedge\cdot m)^\vee(x).$$ Then, taking the absolute value of the expression above and by definition of inverse Fourier transform, \begin{align*}
|\partial^\beta(\hat{f}\cdot m)^\vee(x)| = &
\left| \int_\mathbb{R^n} (\partial^\beta f)^\wedge(\xi)m(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi\cdot x} d\xi  \right| \\

=& \|m\|_{L^\infty} \|(\partial^\beta f)^\wedge\|_{L^1}.

3737954,Can an orthogonal matrix move monotonically toward a signed permutation matrix?,"The question is motivated by this question on Mathematics SE. Let $A \in O(n)$ be an orthogonal matrix that is not a signed permutation matrix, and let $P$ be the nearest signed permutation matrix to $A$ (for 'nearest', use
the distance induced by the Frobenius norm, i.e., $d(A,P)=||A-P||_F$ ). Then can $A$ move 'monotonically' to $P$ ? I.e., in every neighborhood of $A$ , does there exist $B \in O(n)$ such that： (1) $|b_{ij}| \geq |a_{ij}|$ at every non-zero entry $(i,j)$ of $P$ (and at least one inequality is strict), and (2) $|b_{ij}| \leq |a_{ij}|$ at every other entry Note that if we remove the condition that $P$ is the nearest signed permutation matrix to $A$ , then the claim is not true and a counterexample is given in the original question. Also note that the claim is true if $A$ is sufficiently close to $P$ , as we can form a path from $A$ to $P$ by using exponential maps, say a path $B_t$ where $B_0 = A$ and $B_1 = P$ . Since the entries of $B_t$ is analytic in $t$ , in a small enough neighborhood the entries of $B_t$ would be monotonic in $t$ , which shows every matrix in the path satisfies our property. I am leaning toward that the claim is correct, but I am not sure. Any thoughts? Edit: Here is a weaker problem: for every $A\in O(n)$ , $\textit{does there always exist}$ a signed permutation matrix $P$ where $A$ could move 'monotonically' to $P$ in the sense described above? A possible approach is that, let $$C_P=\{B\in M_{n\times n}\mid B \text{ has the same sign as }A\text{ at the non-zero entries of }P, B \text{ has different sign from }A\text{ at the zero entries of }P\}.$$ Because the tangent space of $A$ is $n(n-1)/2$ dimensional, we would be done if we can prove that every $n(n-1)/2$ dimensional subspace of $M_{n\times n}$ intersects $\bigcup_{P\text{ is a permutation matrix}}C_P$ untrivially. Edit 2: Maybe the original question is still too strong, so I would like to weaken (2) to be: (2) $|b_{ij}| \leq |a_{ij}|+\epsilon$ at every other entry Then for every $\epsilon>0$ , does such $B$ exists?

3738598,Prove $G$ is Abelian if $N$ is in the centre of $G$ and $G/N$ is cyclic,"I need some help on this one. $G$ is a group. If $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ contained in the centre of $G$ and $G/N$ is cyclic, show that $G$ is Abelian. My attempt is only half way and stuck at the bit at the end... If $G$ can be shown to be cyclic, then it is Abelian, since $G=<g>$ then $g_1,g_2 \in G$ are $g_1=g^n,g_2=g^m$ for some $n,m$ and $g_1g_2=g^ng^m=g^{n+m}=g^{m+n}=g_2g_1$. By definition of a centre of $G$, $\forall n \in N$, $gn=ng$ for any element in $G$. Namely, $N$ must be a normal subgroup.
  (Here, I pondered if I should just proceed or change gears to looking at homomorphisms of $G$ since $N$ is normal). Now $G/N$ is cyclic so $G/N=<gN>$ for some $g \in G$. Then, $\forall g'N \in G/N$ there is some $m$ so that $(gN)^m=g^mN=g'N$. Therefore, for the representative elements of $G/N$, I have $g^m$. Here I get stuck. So if $g'N$ then I have that each $g'$ is cyclic but as an equivalent class, I cannot guarantee that all $g'$ can be represented in the form $g^m$. The only thing I can guess is the canonical map $p:G \to G/N$ that might be relevant to solving this but again, I don't know how specifically it would help.

3738665,Proof that $ \mathbb{R} $ is uncountable,"Im sure this question has been asked here a lot, but I'd like to hear if the way I understood Cantor's diagonal proof is correct. We know that $ \left(0,1\right)\sim\mathbb{R} $ . So its enough to prove that $ (0,1) $ is uncountable. Now, assume by contradiction that $ (0,1) $ is countable. It implies that exists injection $ f:\left(0,1\right)\to\mathbb{N} $ , and by Cantor-Berenstein theorem it follows that exists a bijection $ g:\mathbb{N}\to(0,1) $ . (Now we need to make and assumption that I do not fully understand, so explanations would be appreaciated. )
We assume that if $2$ real numbers has the same representaion as a decimal expansion that ends with $999999\dots$ and decimal expansion that ends with $00000\dots$ we'll take the expansion that ends with $0000\dots$ Now, from the last arguments we can count the interval $ (0,1) $ and write their decimal expansion: $ g\left(0\right)=0.x_{0,0}x_{0,1}x_{0,2}.... $ $ g\left(1\right)=0.x_{1,0}x_{1,1}x_{1,2....} $ $ \vdots $ We'll show that $ f $ is not surjective. We'll define a sequence of numbers that would be the numbers in the decimal expansion of real number $ d $ such that $ d\notin Im(f) $ . define $ y_{i}=\begin{cases}
2 & x_{i,i}=1\\
1 & x_{i,i}\neq1
\end{cases} $ and define $ d=0.y_{0}y_{1}y_{2}\dots $ . Now assume by contradiction that exists $ i\in \mathbb{N} $ such that $ f(i)=d $ . So the $ i_{th} $ digit in the decimal expansions of $ d $ and $ g(i) $ should be equal, but that's a contradiction. Thus, $ g $ is not surjective. I think this proof works, but Im not sure why would we need the assumption that we are taking the decimal expansion that ends with 00000 rather than the one that ends with 999999.

3738701,Introduction to $L^2$ space. Equivalence class concept,"Given a probability space $\left(\Omega\text{, }\mathcal{F}\text{, }\mathbb{P}\right)$ , let $L^2$ denote all (equivalence classes for a.s. equality of) random variables $X$ such that $\mathbb{E}\{X^2\}<\infty$ . We henceforth identify all random variables $X$ , $Y$ in $L^2$ that are equal a.s. and consider them to be representatives of the same random variable. This has the consequence that if $E\{X^2\}=0$ , we can conclude that $X=0$ (and not only that $X=0$ a.s.). I am not sure I am correctly interpreting the above-quoted statements. What I understand is that, since $E\{X^2\}=0$ , given that $\text{Var}(X)=E\{X^2\}-E\{X\}^2\geq0$ , it must hold that $E\{X\}=0$ . So, at this point one can say that, since $E\{X\}=0$ and $\text{Var}(X)=0$ , $X$ follows a degenerate distribution, that is that $X=0$ a.s.. Now, pretending that what I have said so far is ok, does the statement ""we can conclude that $X=0$ (and not only that $X=0$ a.s.)

3738724,Is this statement about change of variables in limits true?,"I was brainstorming on this and on some related thoughts in the past 2-3 days so any help here would be much appreciated. What put me in these thoughts... was one proof (from a textbook) which I read and which was using the implication b) (see below) very casually and as if it is quite natural to assume that this is true. So I realized this needs more rigorous justification. Is the following statement/theorem true? Given are the two functions: $$g(x): (a,b) \rightarrow (c,d) \tag{1}$$ $$f(x): (c,d) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \tag{2}$$ The function $g$ is continuous, monotonic and takes all values between $c$ and $d$ (it is surjective but possibly not bijective) Let also: $$\lim\limits_{x \to a} g(x) = c$$ Then: a) if the limit $\lim\limits_{y \to c} f(y)$ exists and is $L$ , then $\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(g(x))$ also exists and is equal to $L$ b) if the limit $\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(g(x))$ exists and is $L$ , then $\lim\limits_{y \to c} f(y)$ also exists and is equal to $L$ Note 1 : Here the symbols $a,c$ may denote numbers or $-\infty$ , and the symbols $b,d$ may denote numbers or $+\infty$ Note 2 : By limit exists and equals $L$ , it is meant that the limit is either a number, or also an infinity (positive or negative) I think this theorem is true and it is what justifies when people do simple variable substitutions in limits (almost mechanically) and write casually that: $$\lim\limits_{t \to 0+} \phi(1/t) = \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \phi(x)$$ or say $$\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} \phi((t-2)^{2}) = \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \phi(x)$$ or e.g. $$\lim\limits_{t \to 0} \phi(1/t^2) = \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \phi(x)$$ I think I was able to prove both a) and b). The part a) is proved easily, it even follows from Limit of composite functions theorem But the proof of part b) substantially uses the assumption that $g$ takes all values between $c$ and $d$ (otherwise b) would not hold true, right?). But my point is that when we do almost mechanically such changes of variables in limits (from $t$ to $x$ or from $x$ to $y$ , etc.)... we don't really think about the Limit of composite functions theorem and check its conditions, right? Instead we just think of $g$ as bijection and we assume by intuition that changing the variable works OK because of the bijective behavior of $g$ . Would anyone agree with that? And... could someone confirm this theorem is true? Also, do we need any restrictions on f in this theorem? I think not. Also, can we remove the condition that g is continuous? Or relax the conditions of the theorem in some other way?","['limits', 'change-of-variable', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

3738930,Biot-Savart law on a torus?,"Background: In classical electrodynamics, given the shape of a wire carrying electric current, it is possible to obtain the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ via the Biot-savart law . If the wire is a curve $\gamma$ parametrized as $\mathbf{y}(s)$ , where $s$ is the arc-length, then $$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \beta \int_\gamma \dfrac{ d\mathbf{y}\times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}|^3} 
= \beta  \int_\gamma ds \dfrac{  \mathbf{y}'(s) \times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)|^3} \, ,
 $$ where $\beta $ is just a physical constant proportional to the current in the wire. Another application of the Biot-Savart law is to find the velocity field $\mathbf{v}$ around a bent vortex line in a fluid, in the approximation of incompressible and irrotational fluid flow (i.e. $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} =0$ and $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} =0$ almost everywhere) and very-thin diameter of the vortex core.
In fact, by demanding that the vorticity of the fluid is concentrated on the vortex core
(i.e. it is distributed as a Dirac delta peaked on the vortex core), $$
\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=
 c \int_\gamma ds \, \mathbf{y}'(s)\, \delta(  \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s))   \, ,
$$ we have that the Helmholtz decomposition and the fact $\delta(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x} ) = -\nabla^2 \, (4 \pi |\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}|)^{-1}$ tell us that $$
 \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x})=
 \frac{c}{4 \pi}  \int_\gamma ds \dfrac{  \mathbf{y}'(s) \times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)) }{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}(s)|^3}$$ Again, the constant $c$ is just a physical constant that sets the value of the circulation of the field $\mathbf{v}$ around the vortex. Question: The above construction works in $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Imagine now that the wire (or, equivalently, the irrotational vortex) is a curve in the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3 = S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1$ . How to obtain the equivalent of the Biot-Savart law? Note on topology: We are changing the base manifold from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{T}^3 $ but the local differential relations should be unchanged (i.e. the definition of the vorticity 2-form as the external derivative of the velocity 1-form, or the local form of Maxwell equations $dF = J$ ). The problem is that the Biot-Savart law is non-local, so it is a global problem that ""feels"" the topology of the manifold. Maybe in the end the question is related to how the Helmholtz decomposition works on a torus. Important (possible answer): See the following closely related questions in Physics SE: Rotating away a constant gauge field , Periodic boundary conditions for vortex in a square lattice .

Obviously, I could just pick for each $x_n$ a radius small enough $r$ so that $B(x_n, r)$ doesn't intersect some balls $B(x_1, r_1), \ldots B(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}), B(x_{n+1}, r_{n+1}), \ldots$ , because if that weren't posible, it would mean the sequence would have a converging subsequence to $x_n$ .

3739218,Does parity matter for $\lim_{n\to \infty}\left(\ln 2 -\left(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots -\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\right)\right)^n =\sqrt{e}$?,"Prove that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left(\ln 2 -\left(-\frac12+\frac13-\frac14+\cdots  -\frac{(-1)^n}n\right)\right)^n =\sqrt{e}$$ I happened to encounter this problem proposed  by Mohammed Bouras,Morocco in the facebook group of Romanian mathematical Magazine As per the  title,  I think the limit of the problem depends upon the parity of $n$ . That is,if $n$ is even, the limit is $\frac1{\sqrt e}$ otherwise as stated. My query is, Does the parity indeed matters for this problem ? And if it matters what should be  the conclusion for limit of the problem ? Here is my try we will show that the there exist two different limits  for above problem. For $0< x\leq 1$ , we define the functions $$f(x)=\ln(1+x),\; \displaystyle g(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-x)^k}{k+1}$$ and we note that $$\begin{aligned}f(x)-g(x) &= x-\sum_{k=2}^\infty(-1)^{k+n} \frac{x^{k+n}}{k+n}\\&=x+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+n} \int_0^x t^{k+n-1}dt\\&=x+(-1)^n\int_0^x t^n\left(\sum_{k=1 }^\infty(-1)^k t^{k-1} \right)dx\\&=x-(-1)^n\int_0^x\frac{t^n}{1+t} dt\end{aligned}$$ hence for $x=1$ we have then $$f(1)-g(1)=\ln(2)-\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}=1-(-1)^n\int_0^1\frac{t^n}{1+t}dt$$ Note that latter integral is know result however,here we shall derive it and  we shall show that $$\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}(f(1)-g(1))^n =\begin{cases}\sqrt{e}\; \text{if }  \, n\in 2n-1 \\  \frac1{\sqrt{e}} \; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ We solve the following integral for any $n>0$ . By  polynomial long division it  is trivial to note that $$\int_0^1\frac{t^n}{t+1}dt=(-1)^n\int_0^1\left(\frac{1}{t+1}-\sum_{0\leq j\leq n}(-1)^j t^{j-1}\right)dt$$ and hence on integrating $\displaystyle \int_0^1\frac{t^n}{1+t}dt$ $$\begin{aligned}&=(-1)^n\left(\log(2) -\sum_{1\leq j\leq n} \frac{(-1)^{j+1}}{j}\right)\\&=2^{-1}\left(-\psi\left(\frac{n+1}2\right)+\psi\left(\frac{2n+1}2\right)\right)\\&=\frac12\left(H_{\frac{n}2}-H_{\frac{n-1}2}\right)\end{aligned}$$ Further we note that $H_n\approx \gamma +\ln n +\frac1{2n}-O(n^{-2})$ with which we deduce that $$H_{\frac{n}2} -H_{\frac{n-1}2} \approx  \frac1n-\ln\left(\frac{n-1}n\right)+\frac1{n-1}$$ for all $n>1$ and hence $H_{\frac{n}{2}} -H_{\frac{n-1}2} \to \frac1n$ as $n$ gets larger. Thus we have for $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(f(1)-g(1))^n= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{(-1)^n}{2n}\right)^n=e^{-\frac{(-1)^n}2} =\sqrt{e^{-(-1)^n}}$$ therefore  if $n$ is even we have limit as $\displaystyle \frac1{\sqrt{e}}$ and if $n$ is odd we  have limit $ \displaystyle \sqrt{e}$ . Since we have two different limits. Does it have limit ? Thank you","['integration', 'summation', 'real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
3739251,Find $n$ such that $1-a c^{n-1} \ge \exp(-\frac{1}{n})$,"I am trying to find the integer $n$ such that \begin{align}

3739259,Why should $\sum_{m=1}^N e(\alpha m^3)$ be big for some $\alpha?$,"I'm going through a ""circle method"" proof of the fact that every large enough natural number $n$ is the sum of nine cubes. At some point a lot of control over the function $$f(\alpha)=\sum_{m=1}^N e(\alpha m^3)$$ is needed. Here $N=\lfloor n^{1/3}\rfloor$ and $e(z)=e^{2\pi i z}$ . If we first study the function $$g(\alpha)=\sum_{m=1}^N e(\alpha m)=\frac{e(\alpha(N+1))-e(\alpha)}{e(\alpha)-1}$$ we find that it takes bigger values when $\alpha$ is close to an integer. The author then says that ""a similar analysis shows that $f$ is bigger whenever $\alpha$ is close to a rational number with small denominator"". He/She uses the following major arcs $$\mathcal{U}=\left[\frac{1}{n^{1-\frac{1}{300}}},1+\frac{1}{n^{1-\frac{1}{300}}}\right]$$ $$\mathfrak{M}(a,q)=\left\lbrace \alpha\in\mathcal{U} \mid \left|\alpha-\frac{a}{q}\right|\le\frac{1}{n^{1-\frac{1}{300}}}\right\rbrace\quad a,q\in\mathbb{N}\quad (a,q)=1$$ $$\mathfrak{M}=\bigcup_{1\le q\le n^{1/300}}\bigcup_{\substack{1\le a\le q-1 \\ (a,q)=1}}\mathfrak{M}(a,q)$$ and then says it can be proved that $$\int_\mathfrak{M}f(\alpha)^9e(-\alpha n)\,d\alpha$$ is big (something like $cn^2$ ). I'm completely lost here. How does one prove that? Is there an easy reference on Weyl sums and lower bounds? The author works out the bounds for the integral over the minor arcs but not over the major arcs. Can someone either work it out here or point to a reference where it is worked out in detail? Thanks!! Edit: The only (almost trivial) progress I've been able to make is $$\vert\mathfrak{M}\vert=\sum_{1\le q\le n^{1/300}}\sum_{\substack{1\le a\le q-1 \\ (a,q)=1}}\vert\mathfrak{M}(a,q)\vert\le 2\frac{\varphi(q)}{n^{1-\frac{2}{300}}}\le\frac{\varphi(n^{\frac{1}{300}})}{n^{1-\frac{2}{300}}}<2\frac{n^{\frac{1}{300}}}{n^{1-\frac{2}{300}}}\to 0$$ when $n\to\infty$ . Also $$f\left(\frac{a}{q}\right)=\sum_{m=1}^N e\left(\frac{a}{q}m^3\right)=\sum_{r=1}^q\sum_{\substack{1\le k\le N \\ k\,\equiv_q\,r}}e\left(\frac{a}{q}k^3\right)=\frac{N}{q}\sum_{r=1}^q e\left(\frac{a}{q}r^3\right)$$ The last equality may not be true but $N/q$ is an increasingly good approximation (asymptotically true) of how many integers $1\le k\le N$ are in each residue class modulo $q$ . Maybe this last sum, from $r=1$ to $q$ is easier to estimate. It shouldn't be difficult to get an asymptotic expression for $\vert\mathfrak{M}\vert$ and argue that $f(\alpha)\approx f(a/q)$ in $\mathfrak{M}(a,q)$ so that $$\int_{\mathfrak{M}(a,q)}f(\alpha)^9e(-\alpha n)\, d\alpha\approx\int_{\mathfrak{M}(a,q)}f\left(\frac{a}{q}\right)^9e(-\alpha n)\, d\alpha=\vert\mathfrak{M}(a,q)\vert f\left(\frac{a}{q}\right)^9e(-\alpha n)$$ Better than an answer with a solution: I found the entire set of papers containing the whole proof (two weeks ago but couldn't make this edit earlier) and they come from a number theory course from the University of Leiden","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'trigonometric-series', 'exponential-sum']"
