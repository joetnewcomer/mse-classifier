I'm not yet very good with automorphisms, so I'm trying to make sure my proofs are OK. Proof: Since ${\rm Aut}(G)$ is cyclic, ${\rm Aut}(G)$ is abelian. Thus for any elements $\phi, \psi \in{\rm Aut}(G)$ and some elements $g_i \in G$ , $\phi\psi(g_1g_2)=\phi\psi(g_1)\phi\psi(g_2)=g_3g_4=\phi\psi(g_2)\phi\psi(g_1)=\phi\psi(g_2g_1)=g_4g_3$ . Hence, $g_3g_4=g_4g_3\implies G$ is abelian. The proof seems to be quite straightforward, but I'd rather ask for advice.","['automorphism-group', 'group-isomorphism', 'abelian-groups', 'solution-verification', 'group-theory']"

1525517,The boundedness of a certain sequence of expectations,"In Bálint Tóth's paper, ""No More Than Three Favourite Sites for Simple Random Walk"", while proving one of the many technical lemmas in his theorem's proof, he makes the following claim: suppose for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $B_n$ is a binomially distributed random variable of $n$ trials and probability of success $p=\frac12$. That is, $P(B_n=\ell)={n\choose\ell}2^{-\ell}$ for any $\ell=0,1,\dots,n$. Then, for any $\gamma<\frac12$,
$$\sup_n \operatorname{E}\left(\exp\{\gamma(2B_n-n)^2/n\}\right)<\infty.$$ I'm just not quite seeing why this has to be true, and Tóth never explains why it is. Maybe it's a well-known fact in probability theory, but I've never come across any instances of this precise result. Can it be proven with standard probability inequalities, or does it hinge on the fact that $B_n$ is binomial? Also, why exactly do we require $\gamma<\frac12$?

1525649,Sup Norm and Uniform Convergence,"My book says Convergence in sup norm $||f_n-f||\to 0$ is equivalent to uniform convergence and this follows immediately from definitions. but I just want to check: $\Rightarrow$ If lim$_{n\to\infty}||f_n-f||=0$, then sup$\{|f_n(x)-f(x)|:x\in[a,b]\}\to 0\Rightarrow |f_n(x)-f(x)|\to 0 \forall x\in[a,b]\Rightarrow (f_n)\to f$ uniformly.

My question is, why $|f_n(x)-f(x)|\to 0 \forall x\in[a,b]\Rightarrow$sup$\{|f_n(x)-f(x)|:x\in[a,b]\}\to 0$. I think it's because sup is really max here because functions are continuous and $[a,b]$ is compact. Is this right?

1525711,Non-existence of embedded incompressible surfaces,"I want to prove the following assumption: Let $g,h$ be natural numbers with $g > h$ and let $S_g$ be the closed, orientable surface of genus $g$. Then, there is no (smooth) map $f: S_g \to S_h \times (-1,1)$, embedding $S_g$ as an incompressible subsurface. The problem here is that it's not sufficient to look at the fundamental group alone. For any $h$ there exists some $g > h$ and a covering map from $S_g$ to $S_h$. This will induce a smooth map $f: S_g \to S_h \times (-1,1)$ which will provide an injection on fundamental groups. Clearly, however, this $f$ is not embedding. Similarily, one can easily also construct an embedding on $S_g$ into $S_h \times (-1,1)$, but such a map will not be incompressible. I tried to argue by contradiction, and came up with the following idea: Suppose there existed an incompressible embedding $f: S_g \to S_h \times (-1,1)$. This would induce a map $f_*: H_1(S_g) \to H_1(S_h)$ which must have non-trivial kernel, since $g > h$. As such, one can find an essential simple closed curve $\gamma \subset S_g$ such that it's embedded counterpart $f(\gamma)$ is null-homologous in $S_g \times (-1,1)$. Now, somehow, the fact that $f$ is an embedding must imply that $f(\gamma)$ is already null-homotopic . How can we show this ?","['manifolds', 'algebraic-topology', 'surfaces', 'general-topology']"

1525808,Infinitesimal Generator of Local Group of Transformation,"I am stuck on concept of infinitesimal generator. I am reading Olver and i quote definitions from there Given a local group of transformation G acting on Manifold M via $g.x= \Psi(g,x)$ for $(g,x)\in \mathbb{U} \subset G\times M$. Then for every $v\in \mathbb{g}$ (the lie algebra of G) we define a vector field on M
$$\begin{equation}
\psi(v)|_{x} = \frac{d}{d\epsilon}\Bigg{|}_{\epsilon=0} \Psi(exp(\epsilon v),x) \tag{1}
\end{equation}$$
Then it goes on to say that we identify $\mathbb{g}$ with $\psi{(\mathbb{g})}$ and this forms a Lie algebra of vector fields on M. In this language, ""we recover $\mathbb{g}$ from group transformations by the basic formula
$$\begin{equation}
v|_{x} = \frac{d}{d\epsilon}\Bigg{|}_{\epsilon=0}exp(\epsilon v)x   \tag{2}

A vector field $v$ in $\mathbb{g}$ is called an infinitesimal generator of the group action G. From what I understand, when it says that we recover $\mathbb{g}$ from group transformation is that we obtain that subset of vectorfields on M which is an image of lie algebra of G (determined by number of parameters specified in group transformation) under $\psi$. Is that correct ? For example if the given transformation is $(x,y) \mapsto (x+c\epsilon, y + \epsilon) $ then the underlying group is $R$. Eq (2) will give me $c\partial_x + \partial_y$ if i consider $exp(\epsilon v)(x,y)= (x+c \epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ with $v=\textbf{1}.\frac{d}{d\epsilon}$ i. This is the image of vector field ""$\textbf{1}.\frac{d}{d\epsilon}$"" on $R$ under $\psi$ by our first equation. So for a 1-d Group action can one say that image of the vector field ""$\textbf{1}.\frac{d}{d\epsilon}$"" is called infinitesimal generator. ii. What is the infinitesimal generator of $(x,y)\mapsto(\epsilon x, \epsilon^3 y)$? As per equation (2) i get $\partial_x$ but i think that is not the case. iii. how do we solve for infinitesimal generator if tranformation group has two parameters? say $(x,y)\mapsto(x+\mu + \epsilon, y + \epsilon)$.

In lecture we defined the following differential equation: $$y'=\frac{G(x,y)}{F(x,y)}$$ We assumed that $F,G$ vanish at point $(x_0,y_0)$ . So we approximated the behavior of the diff. equation at point $(x_0,y_0)$ as: $$y'=\frac{cx+dy}{ax+by}$$ (I have no idea why we can just do that). Also, we defined a matrix: $$A=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}$$ Then we applied a invertible linear transformation to it: $$\begin{pmatrix} \zeta \\ \eta\end{pmatrix}=D\begin{pmatrix}x \\y\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}d_{11} & d_{12} \\d_{21} &d_{22}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix} \iff \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix}=D^{-1}\begin{pmatrix} \zeta \\ \eta\end{pmatrix}$$ Our lecturer then said something about the eigenvalues of $A$ giving us information about the solutions.

  the costant ratio of area,we must have some other relevant figure
   projected along with the ellipse. For this example,we consider the

Often the traditional proofs hinge on the use of the Schwartz space or $L^1(\Bbb R)\cap L^2(\Bbb R)$ in conjunction with the convolution theorem. I recently came up with a proof that doesn't use the convolution theorem at all and is instead somewhat of a ""pure"" $L^2$ approach while still working on $L^1(\Bbb R)\cap L^2(\Bbb R)$. I am sure it is not a new proof, but I will post it as an answer below. This led me to wonder just how many different fairly well-known proofs there are for the $L^2$ isometry of the Fourier transform on $\Bbb R$. I was hoping that we could collect some of them in a big list. Of course replicating a full proof is not advisable since they can be quite lengthy, but a brief, rough outline would be quite appreciated along with a text or PDF reference for the full proof. One of the issues with integral transform theory is that proof techniques vary wildly from one integral transform to another. What I am hoping to accomplish with this list is that it will provide a wealth of approaches for showing $L^2$ properties of integral transforms.","['fourier-analysis', 'big-list', 'functional-analysis']"

1526292,Colliding Bullets,"I saw this problem yesterday on reddit and I can't come up with a reasonable way to work it out. Once per second, a bullet is fired starting from $x=0$ with a uniformly random speed in $[0,1]$ . If two bullets collide, they both disappear. If we fire $N$ bullets, what is the probability that at least one bullet escapes to infinity? What if we fire an infinite number of bullets? Attempt. If $N$ is two, then it's equal to the probability that the first bullet is faster than the second, which is $\dfrac{1}{2}$ . If $N$ is odd, the probability of three bullets or more colliding in the same spot is $0$ , so we can safely ignore this event. And since collisions destroy two bullets then there will be an odd number of bullets at the end. So at least one escapes to infinity. For infinite bullets, I suspect that no single bullet will escape to infinity, but that they'll reach any arbitrarily big number. Although, I'm not sure on how I'd begin proving it.

We therefore gamble one unit on the first toss and on each toss after a $T$. 

After one head, we gamble three. This guarantees that if we get a $T$ next then we go to $-n$. 

After two heads we are therefore up 4, and so we gamble 7  to get us to $-n$ again. our gambling winnings is a martingale since we are making finite trades in a martingale (any bounded trading strategy in a martingale is a martingale).

After three heads our position is $11 - (n-3)=14-n$. the time taken to get three heads is a stopping time with finite expectation so if we stop at it we still have a martingale (Optional sampling theorem) thus $\mathbb E (14 -n) = 0 $ and we are done.

Thus, we can enumerate through the first $k - 1$ objects and select $n$ to make sure we have $k$ adjacent numbers. In other words, this particular choices gives us $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = n$ so that we have $$ S_n = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} = \frac{k(n+1)}{2}$$. I contend that we know this is at least the above since I chose all $ k - 1 $ consecutive numbers below $ k $ and the maximum in the set $ n$. I can choose whatever I want, so it stands to reason that larger numbers will be larger than the sum above and thus represents a lower bound. This concludes my pseudo proof. Issue Just one. How could I prove this with the pigeonhole principle? I have some beef with my above logic. First, the chapter in my book is about the pigeonhole principle. Which is easy to understand, but I am not quite sure how to apply that property to solve the above problem. The second is the proof is a little handwavy by appealing to intuition. I think this would suffice on a napkin during cocktails, ahem , but not stand up to rigorous standards.","['summation', 'pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I would be interested if it is possible to adapt this prove to compact convergence.

I can't see how this can give us more information. We can try this approach: the limit exists and it is equal to $0$, so if we approach $(0,0)$ from any path, the function will take the value $0$. For example, we can examine the paths $y=x$ then $\displaystyle f(x,x)=\frac{ax^2+bx^2+cx^2}{x^2+x^2}=\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is $x$ independent so it must be equal to $0\Leftrightarrow  a+b+c=0$.

I recommend you simply skip to edit 4, and then see the answers below. Let us consider the integral $\int_A fd\mu = \int 1_A(x)f(x)d\mu (x), A\in \mathscr{B}$ (we are dealing with Borel sets). If $\mu (A) = 0$ then the integral is zero, and thus the integrand is zero (as referenced by many other topics here on stack exchange, such as This topic ). What I don't get is how $\mu(A) = 0$ implies the integrand is zero. I believe it implies that the integral is zero, as $\int 1_A (x) f(x) d\mu (x)$ just $f \mu (A)$ = 0$, correct? But I don't see how the integrand must be zero. Indeed, even at the thread I linked to, it seems that it suffices to show that if $\mu =0$ , or $\int_A fd\mu =0 $ then $f=0$ , but I don't understand how those lead to $f=0$ ... Edit: maybe it is something like $f = 1_A (x) f(x)$ which can be anything where $\mu =0$ , and in order for $\int 1_A(x)f(x)d\mu (x) =0 $ (implied by $\int_A f d\mu = 0$ and $\int_A f d\mu = \int 1_A(x)f(x)d\mu (x)$ ) then $1_A(x)f(x) = 0$ a.e., and perhaps $1_A(x)f(x) = f(x)$ somehow? Edit 2: I guess here is what I am wondering: in the problem $\int_A fd\mu$ , is the integrand $f$ or is it $f$ on the domain A . For those who don't follow, here is why it matters: if the integrand is $f$ on the domain $A$ , then we know that $f$ on the domain $A$ is $1_A(x) f(x)$ . But $A$ has measure zero since $\mu(A) = 0$ , and $1_A(x)f(x) = 0$ everywhere outside A (because the indicator function is zero), so therefore we can say that the integrand $f$ is zero A.E (since A.E. means we exclude (don't consider) set A since it has measure zero) EDIT 3: I will ask the above edit (#2) as a separate question and link the answer here, hopefully. EDIT 4: (Hopefully final) So I believe I asked a question different than what I had in mind (but which worked out better for me), and perhaps different than what I outlined in the mass of text above. here is what the title asks: If $\mu (A) =0$ , and $\int f d\mu = 0$ , then $f=0$ a.e. The reasoning for this is as both people state below, albeit briefly. If the measure of a set that is not A is not zero, then the integrand $f$ must be zero (in order for the integral to be zero). Whatever $f$ is on A, however, we don't care about, since we are saying that the function is zero A.E.","['lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"
1527165,Homework: limit of $\frac{1}{n}\sqrt[n]{\prod_{k=1}^n(n+k)}$ as $n\to\infty$,"Determine the following limit $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sqrt[n]{(n+1)(n+2)\ldots (n+n)} $$ Idea #1 the nth root could be rewritten as
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sqrt[n]{\frac{(n+n)!}{n!}} $$
Noticing that $n^{-1}$ is an infinitesimal, if the n-th root were bounded, the limit would be $0$. But hoping that $\sqrt[n]{\frac{(n+n)!}{n!}}$ is bounded is a pipe dream, this clearly tends to $\infty$. Idea #2 $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\ln\left (\frac{1}{n}[(n+1)\ldots (n+n)]^\frac{1}{n}\right ) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left [-\ln n+\frac{1}{n}\left (\ln (n+1)+\ln (n+2)+\ldots +\ln (n+n) \right )\right ]$$
but trying to bring it to a common denominator doesn't help either, what I would have is
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n} \left [-n\ln n+\ln (n+1)+\ldots +\ln 2+\ln n\right ]$$
Which doesn't bring me any closer to simplification. The solution of this must something entirely different. I would like a hint/point me in the direction I should go.","['limits', 'real-analysis']"
1527170,A closed subspace of a reflexive Banach space is reflexive,"Let $X$ be a reflexive Banach Space. Let $Y$ be a closed subspace of it.I need to show that $Y$ is reflexive as well. So as usual I consider the inclusion map $$J: Y \to Y'', J(y)=j_{y}, j_{y}(y')=y'(y)$$, where $Y''$ denotes the bidual space of $Y$. I need to show that the map is onto because everything else is guaranteed (one-one and isometry) I pick an element say $y^{**} \in Y''$, then define $\tilde{y} \in X''$ such that $\tilde{y}(x')=y^{**}(x'|_{Y})$. Then it is well-defined, linear, continuous. Since $X$ is reflexive there is $x \in X$ such that $j_{x}=\tilde{y}$. Suppose that $x \not \in Y$. Then since $Y$ is closed, by Hahn-Banach theorem, there is $f:X \to K$ such that $f(x)=1$ and $f|_{Y}=0$. Then $\tilde{y}(f)=f(x)=1=y^{**}(0)=0$ which can't happen. Thus $x=y \in Y$ I need to show that $j_{y}=y^{**}$.","['duality-theorems', 'weak-convergence', 'functional-analysis']"

1527279,Is $n_{\rightarrow\infty}\overline{\frac{n}{\phi (n)}}$ unbounded? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : On the mean value of a multiplicative function: Prove that $\sum\limits_{n\leq x} \frac{n}{\phi(n)} =O(x) $ (3 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Does a $\limsup_{n\to\infty}$ exist for $\overline{\dfrac{n}{\phi (n)}},$ where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function, and the overbar represents the mean. Of course $\dfrac{n}{\phi (n)}$ is unbounded, as it grows like $e^{\gamma } \log (\log (x))+\dfrac{\text{c}}{\log (\log (x))}$ for some $c\approx 3,$ where $c\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty,$ but I was wondering whether the set of (mostly, priomorial multiples) is dense enough to impose a limit on the function. Numerical tests suggest $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\overline{\dfrac{n}{\phi (n)}}\approx 2,$ but I can't find any references to the subject. Is this realistic, or is the function unbounded?",['number-theory']

$f(0) = -(0) = 0$. For the step I get:
$f(n) = -n$ and $f(n) - (n+1) = f(n+1)$, so I get $-2n-1 = f(n+1)$ instead of $-n-1$ Where is my fault in the induction? For the Problem 2 I'm asking for some hints!
