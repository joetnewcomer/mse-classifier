1890591,"What is the formal, precise definition of area (and that of volume) in geometry?","Note: I am asking two questions. Replace ""area"" by ""volume"" with appropriate adjustments to get the second question Hello everyone. I am studying mathematics in college and I am trying to find the formal definition of the notion ""area"" in geometry. What is area? I can understand it when the sides involved are integers, like when the side is 3, we have nine 1x1 grids, so the area is 9 if we think of area as the number of ""unit grids"". Maybe we can also define area for squares with rational sides in the same vein, but this is not a good way of thinking because how to define the area of a square of side PI or an irrational number for example? Please give me a formal definition of area. I am looking for the most precise definition. I am not finding any results on the internet. Thanks in advance","['definition', 'area', 'volume', 'geometry']"
1890614,Mathematical definition of infinity [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What exactly is infinity? (13 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I've heard from mathematicians, and not mathematicians, that the infinity is not a number. Is a concept, an idea. Good! But we are in the world of mathematics, a world in where it's supposed to be able to define any mathematical object (I have doubts about this...) with precision and rigour. I've been dealing with this concept in many areas but, SINCE THEN, I don't have the precise meaning. I don't like the idea of talking without definitions in math... So I was wondering if the math definition of this concept exists? And where I can find it?","['functional-analysis', 'abstract-algebra', 'real-analysis']"
1890620,Finding path-lengths by the power of Adjacency matrix of an undirected graph,"I knew from Mark Newman's book - Networks: An Introduction (Page 137, Eq: 6.31) that, if $A$ is the adjacency matrix of a graph, then $ij$'th entry of $A^k$ will give me the number of $k$-length paths connecting the vertices $i$ and $j$. This works very well for directed graphs. But does it work for undirected graphs too? For instance, for the undireceted network below: if i want to calculate how many $3$-length paths are there from vertex-$2$ to vertex-$1$, then I should find $[A^3]_{12}$. Proceeding in this way, I get, 
\begin{eqnarray}
A^3 = 
\left(
\begin{matrix}
4 && 6 && 1 && 5 && 5 \\
6 && 2 && 3 && 6 && 2  \\
1 && 3 && 0 && 1 && 2 \\
5 && 6 && 1 && 4 && 5 \\
5 && 2 && 2 && 5 && 2
\end{matrix}
\right)
\end{eqnarray}
And, I find, the entry of the 1st row and 2nd column = 6 = entry of the 2nd row and 1st column . Does it mean that there are 6 paths of length 3 from vertex-2 to vertex-1? Cearly it is not true because I have only $1$ path of length $3$ from 2 to 1, namely the sequence: $(2,4,5,1)$. What am I missing? UPDATE:
I am attaching a snapshot of Newman's book. He only talks about ""paths"", but never about a ""walk"". Is it a mistake? Newman's book snapshot","['matrices', 'graph-theory', 'adjacency-matrix', 'nonnegative-matrices']"

1890659,Generalizing Variant Proof of Basel Problem,"Recently I have been thinking a lot about variations of the Basel Problem, and methods to solve them. Here I found the following solution to the Basel Problem by Alfredo Z. (I include the entire answer due to its brevity) Define the following series for $ x > 0 $ $$\frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 -
 \frac{x^2}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{7!}+\cdots\quad.$$ Now substitute $ x = \sqrt{y}\ $ to arrive at $$\frac{\sin \sqrt{y}\ }{\sqrt{y}\ } = 1 -
 \frac{y}{3!}+\frac{y^2}{5!}-\frac{y^3}{7!}+\cdots\quad.$$ if we find the roots of $\frac{\sin \sqrt{y}\ }{\sqrt{y}\ } = 0 $ we
  find that $ y = n^2\pi^2\ $ for $ n \neq 0 $ and $ n $ in the integers With all of this in mind, recall that for a polynomial $ P(x) = a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +\cdots+a_{1}x + a_{0} $ with roots
  $ r_{1}, r_{2}, \cdots , r_{n} $ $$\frac{1}{r_{1}} + \frac{1}{r_{2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{r_{n}} =
 -\frac{a_{1}}{a_{0}}$$ Treating the above series for $ \frac{\sin \sqrt{y}\ }{\sqrt{y}\ } $
  as polynomial we see that $$\frac{1}{1^2\pi^2} + \frac{1}{2^2\pi^2} + \frac{1}{3^2\pi^2} +
 \cdots =  -\frac{-\frac{1}{3!}}{1}$$ then multiplying both sides by $ \pi^2 $ gives the desired series. $$\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots = 
 \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$ This solution fascinated me. Although it takes a few things for granted (such as that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra applies to infinite polynomials) I nevertheless thought the proof was one of the most beautiful I've seen. In attempting to generalize this I stumbled across the following function and its associated power series:
$$\cos\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\cosh\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^{4k}}{(4k)!}(-1)^k$$ By a simple substitution we find that
$$\cos\left(\frac{x^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\cosh\left(\frac{x^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^{k}}{(4k)!}(-1)^k$$ Which is a polynomial in $x$; noting that $\cosh$ is nowhere zero (on the real line) we solve for the roots as such:
$$\cos\left(\frac{x^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 0 \implies \frac{x^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}} = n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \implies x = \frac{\pi^4(2n+1)^4}{4}$$
Using the argument for Viete's Formula in the solution above, we find that $$\frac{4}{\pi^4}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+1)^4} = -\frac{-\frac{1}{4!}}{1}$$
Upon manipulation we find that
$$\color{red}{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+1)^4} = \frac{\pi^4}{96}}$$ From here we can bring this into a form more like that of the Basel Problem by noting that
$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+2)^4} = \frac{1}{16}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(k+1)^4} = \frac{1}{16}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^4}$$ Noting that this computes the even terms of $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-4}$ we find that the odd terms must equal $\frac{15}{16}\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-4}$ which is our series calculated above Applying this, we find that, as desired, $$\color{red}{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^4} = \frac{\pi^4}{90}}$$ However, I have been unable to generalize this approach further . Intuition tells me that the functions desired would have power series similar to those used, and would be a combination of trigonometric functions. Nevertheless, I have only been able to solve this for the case above (which required me to switch the power series from $\sin(x)$ to $\cos(x)$ from Alfredo's proof, as neglecting $\cosh(x)$ was desirable). My question is thus: Can this proof format be applied to solve series of the form $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-n}$ for any $n$ other than $2$ and $4$? Note: I apologize for the length of this post, but I felt that a full presentation of the proof might assist in generalizing it. If anyone has any suggestions concerning this please let me know! Note 2: In case anyone is troubled by this seemingly naive application of Viete's Formula to infinite polynomials, know that this is perfectly valid, and is known as the Root Linear Coefficient Theorem .","['power-series', 'polynomials', 'sequences-and-series']"

1890674,What is the relationship between the following set functions?,"This problem is taken from Section 2.5 of Royden and Fitzpatrick's Real Analaysis, Fourth Edition text. For any open interval $I = (a,b)$, let $\ell(I) = b-a$ denote the length of $I$.
For any set of real numbers $A$, define the following set functions:
\begin{align}
m^*(A) &= \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty \ell(I_n): \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n \supseteq A, I_n \text{ is an open, bounded interval for all $n$}\right\} \\

I think I can show that $m^* = m^{**}$ for all subsets of $\mathbf{R}$.
However, I am only able to show $m^*(A) = m^{***}(A)$ if $m^{***}(A) = \infty$ or $A$ is measurable. Is this the correct answer? In particular, is it possible to find a set such that $m^{***}(A) < m^*(A)$?","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"

Consider infinite fair coin tossing. Let $H_n$ be the the event that the $n^\text{th}$ coin comes up heads. Define
$$B_n = H_{n+1} \cap H_{n+2} \cap \dots \cap H_{n+ [\log_2\log_2 n]}$$
Why are the $B_n$ not independent of each other? Also, related to this (and perhaps why I am misunderstanding), does it make sense to consider values of $n$ where $\log_2\log_2 n$ is not an integer? If so, how is this interpreted? I mean, I think I get why : The $B_n$ overlap each other (to varying extents). But that the overlap is not apparent to me right now. More specifically, $\log_2(\log_2 n)$ tends to be pretty small, even for large $n$. If we consider only values of $n$ where $\log_2(\log_2 n)$ is a whole number, the dependence of $\{ B_n\}$ is not obvious to me, because such values of $n$ seem to be very far apart (far enough to prevent overlap, I think?). If we allow $\log_2(\log_2 n)$ to not be an integer, then I can see how the $B_n$ are not independent (because then we have $n+1, n+2,\dotsc, n+4$ for one value of $n$ and then $(n+1) +1 = n+2,\dotsc, (n+1) +4.xxxx$ for the next), but then I don't know how to interpret, for example, $H_{n+4.90689}$ (when $n=2^{30}$).

1890913,How do you extend an isometry from a dense set?,"Question Assume you have a $W \subset  V$ such that $W$ is dense in $V$, where $W,V$ are metric spaces. You have a function $f: W \mapsto H$, where $H$ is another metric space. Also, $\lVert w\rVert_W = \lVert f(w)\rVert_H$ (ie $f$ is an isometry). My questions are: How do you ""naturally extend"" $f$ from $W$ to $V$ in an unique way, such that $f$ is still an isometry on $V$? What happens if $f$ is just a function, not necessarily an isometry? Do you need $W,V$ to be complete for this to work? If in this general setting this is not possible, please refer below to the actual problem I have. Thoughts The obvious thing would be to find a sequence $(w_i)_{i\ge 0} \subset W$ that tends in the $V$-norm to $v \in V$ and define $$f(v) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(w_n)$$ But I have already trouble proving that it's an isometry; in fact doing $$\lVert f(v) \rVert _V =\lVert \lim_{n \to \infty}f(w_n) \rVert _V \mathop{=}^? \lim_{n \to \infty} \lVert f(w_n) \rVert _V = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \lVert w_n \rVert _V = \lVert v \rVert _V$$ But how to justify bringing the limit outside? To check that is well defined one would also need to check that if $w_n, v_n $ both tend in the $V$-norm to $v$, then $$f(v) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(w_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(v_n)$$ It's easy to show that $\lVert v_n - w_n \rVert_V \to 0$, which implies $$\lVert f(w_n) - f(v_n) \rVert_V \to 0$$, but that does not imply pointwise convergence (as in the limit above).

I view $\Lambda_1$ as a subspace of $L^2(\Omega \times \mathbb R_+, \mathcal G \otimes \mathcal B(\mathbb R_+), dP \times ds)$.

1891141,Making sense of angles in $\mathbb{R^n}$,"One of the definitions of the dot product of two vectors is the following $$\vec{a} \bullet \vec{b}\ \  \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \ \ \|\vec{a}\| \,\|\vec{b}\|\cos(\theta)$$ Where $\theta$ denotes the angle between the vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. But for that angle $\theta$ to 'make sense', both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ must lie in the same plane correct? i.e. There must exist some two-dimensional space, e.g. $\mathbb{R^2}$, that both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are an element of. Now we can always find a plane that both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ fall in. But now the question arises, are we finding the angle $\theta$ with respect to the plane that they lie in (what I'm trying to say is: Is $\theta$ denoting the angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ in a plane that they both fall in?), or is it with respect to the basis vectors of of the original vector space that they lie in initially. Here's an example that will hopefully get across what I'm asking: Take $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R^4}$. If we can find a plane that both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ both lie in, then 'the angle between them' , $\theta$, makes sense. If not then what essentially is being said is $\theta$ is the angle between two vectors in four-dimensional space, and I'm not sure that an angle in $\mathbb{R^4}$ has any sort of meaning. My question then essentially boils down to the following. Are angles only defined (or do they only have meaning) in $\mathbb{R^2}$? If we have two vectors in $\mathbb{R^n}$, is the only way to find the 'angle between them' by first finding a plane (a two-dimensional vector space) that they both lie in, and then solving for the angle with respect to that plane?","['trigonometry', 'linear-algebra', 'vectors', 'vector-spaces']"
1891169,Uniformly Lipschitz and bounded variation,"I found an interesting question in a textbook (Apostol analysis chapter 6 problem… 2?) and was wondering if anyone could help me figure this out, or at least help adjust my thinking. A function $f$ is called uniformly Lipschitz of order $\alpha>0$ on $[0,1]$ if $|f(x)-f(y)|<M|x-y|^\alpha$ for all $0\le x,y\le1$ and for some fixed $M$ . (a) Prove that $\alpha>1$ implies $f$ is constant, where $\alpha=1$ implies $f$ is of bounded variation. (b) Find an $f$ that is uniformly Lipschitz on $[0,1]$ for some $\alpha<1$ but not of bounded variation. (c) Find an $f$ of bounded variation on $[0,1]$ that satisfies no uniformly Lipschitz condition. My progress: (a) I solved, if $\alpha>1$ then $\left|\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}h\right|<M|h|^{\alpha-1}\to0$ as $h\to0$ , so $f'=0$ . For $\alpha=1$ , replace the RHS with $M$ , so $f'$ is bounded, so it is of bounded variation. (b) I am not sure. The only functions not of bounded variation I can think of are things involving $\sin(1/x)$ , which I have no conceivable way to prove are uniformly Lipschitz. In particular I guess that $x\sin(1/x)$ works but have no idea how to prove that it's Lipschitz (if it's even). Maybe $\sqrt{x}\sin(1/x)$ would be better because then there is a conceivable way to connect that to $\alpha=1/2<1$ , plus we proved that it's not Lipschitz in a previous exercise. (c) I haven't been able to find anything. If it satisfies no Lipschitz condition, then I am pretty sure that probably $f'$ needs to be unbounded at some point. I'm pretty sure the way to approach this problem is by finding some monotonic function that satisfies no Lipschitz condition since that would imply it is of bounded variation. It can't be something like $\sqrt{x}$ (chosen because of the vertical tangent at $x=0$ ) since that would probably satisfy like $\alpha=1/2$ . There are only a few classical continuous functions with vertical asymptotes, like $x^a$ ( $0<a<1$ ) or $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ , where the second is basically symmetric with the first one. I also tried to construct it with the following reasoning: translate so that $f(0)=0$ , then make $\left|\frac{f(x)}{x^\alpha}\right|$ unbounded for all $\alpha>0$ . The smallest function that comes to mind that dominates all polynomial growth is $e^x$ , which would give the construction of $f(x)=e^{1/x}$ . But if $f(0^+)=+\infty$ , then there will be no way to define $f(0)$ so that $f$ is strictly monotonic. Also there is a property that all functions of bounded variation need to be bounded too. So, this probably won't work. Anyways thank you for the help.","['lipschitz-functions', 'analysis', 'bounded-variation']"

My question is a bit more basic, can the difference between the strong Markov property and the ordinary Markov property be intuited by saying: ""the Markov property implies that a Markov chain restarts after every iteration of the transition matrix. By contrast, the strong Markov property just says that the Markov chain restarts after a certain number of iterations given by a hitting time $T$ ""?

I tried solving for $X = 50$ first by using the Law of Large Numbers but I don't think I'm correct. So $A_n$ is the average number of 6s after 50 throws. $E[A_n] = 1000 * (1/6) = 166.667$ Since $Var(A_n) = Var(X)/n$ and $X$ has Binomial distribution (or is it Bernoulli?) we can use $Var(X) = p(1-p)n$. $Var(A_n) = [p(1-p)n]/n = 5/36$. The observed value of $A_n$ is $1/20$ therefore it is $1/6 - 1/20 = 7/60$ away from the expected value. $$P(|A_n - 1/6| \geq 1/20) = Var(A_n)/(7/60)^2 = (5/36)/(7/60)^2 = 10.2$$ This answer is way off what I expected and I'm also not sure how to differentiate between above and below the observed rolls.","['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I am completely stuck here as I'm having a difficult time conceptualising the double sum. I know that the the inner sum has a limit of $1 \over e$, and using that information, we could express the limit of the whole thing as ${1 \over e} \sum\limits_{r=0}^\infty {1 \over r!}$. Now I also know that the limit to the above $\sum\limits_{r=0}^\infty {1 \over r!} = e$. So by my loose ideas and arguments above the proof could be complete by, ${1 \over e} \cdot e = 1$.

Can $4^b$ always be written as a sum of some subset of $4^{a_1},\dots,4^{a_n}$? I think it might be possible to perform some sort of greedy algorithm, where we collect four identical powers of $4$, whenever such exist, into a greater power of $4$.

1891810,"Probability ""Paradox"" I've been thinking of","Last night I thought about a probablity ""paradox"" that I would like if someone could clarify for me. I couldn't find this version of it anywhere (I thought about it myself) so I hope it isn't something that has been answered before. The paradox goes like this: suppose we have 2 friends, Alice and Bob, and we let them play a game: 
the ""game master"" puts a note with a natural number on Alice's forehead, and the same goes for Bob (Those two numbers can be equal, or different).
Each of them is requested to state a natural number that is larger (or equals to) the number on their forehead. They win if at least one of them is correct. In the first version of the game, they are both in seperate rooms, and don't know anything about their friend in the other room. In the second version of the game, they are sitting in front of each other, and can see the number on their friend's forehead. Now, intuitively, there should be no difference between their chances of winning the game in both versions, because the number on their friend's forehead gives them absolutly no information about their number . But this is not true. In the second vesrion, they can use the simple strategy of just stating the number on their friend's forehead.
It assures winning because one of the two numbers is larger (or equal to) the other one. However, I think it is quite obvious that there is nothing that they can do in the first version. I don't know a lot about probability, but intuitively I believe their winning chance is actually $0$ (is it even something that makes sense?) - stating ""$1$"" isn't really better than stating ""$10^{10^{100}}$"" in any way. So the paradox is: what exactly is the extra information they recieved in the seocnd version? How does this make sense? I'd love to hear your explanations. I think it is a beautiful paradox but I can't think of anything convincing to say about it. Thank you for your time reading the question!","['intuition', 'probability', 'soft-question', 'paradoxes']"

First I wrote $$3^{999^{100}} \bmod 225 = (3^{999} \bmod 225)^{100} \bmod 225. $$ I noticed that $225 = 3 \cdot 75 = 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 25)$. So I tried working on the system $$ \begin{cases} 3^{999^{100}} \bmod 25 = 0 \\ (27^{333} \bmod 25)^{100} \bmod 25 \end{cases}$$ and then using Chinese Remainder theorem. For the last equation, We have $27^{333} \equiv 2^{333} \equiv (8^{111} \bmod 25)^{100} \bmod 25. $ To compute $(8^{111} \bmod 25)$, I just kept squaring, computing $8^2, 8^4, 8^8$ etc, and taking the modulo each time. Eventually I found $8^{111} \equiv 17 \bmod 25$. Then I needed to find $$17^{100} \bmod 25 \equiv (17^4 \cdot 17^{25} ) \bmod 25. $$ By squaring again I found the answer as $22 \bmod 25$. So I used the Chinese Remainder theorem to find the solution of $$ \begin{cases} x \bmod 25 = 22 \\ x \bmod 3 = 0 \end{cases}$$ which gave me $x = 72$. So I managed to find $$3^{999^{100}} \bmod 225 = 72 \bmod 225. $$ Now, I was wondering if there is no better trick/faster way to find the correct answer by hand (no calculator), since I'm not looking forward to doing another hour of computation to find the second expression. Thank you in advance. Later addition: With the help of Arthurs hints: We have $225 = 9 \cdot 25$. Hence for the first expression I have the system $$ \begin{cases} 3^{999^{100}} \bmod 9 = 0 \\ 3^{999^{100}} \bmod 25 = a. \end{cases}. $$ I want to find $a$ now. I have $\phi(25) = 20$, so $3^{20} \bmod 25 = 1 \bmod 25$ by Euler. Now I wanted to write the exponent $999^{100}$ as a multiple of $20$. I have $3^{(20 \cdot (50-1))^{100}} = 3^{20^{100} \cdot (50-1)^{100}} = (3^{20})^{(20^{99} \cdot (50-1)^{100})}$.

  The question is to compute $g(\ell,n)$ for general $\ell$ and $n$. Note also that, for every $\ell\in\mathbb{Z}$, $g(\ell+n,n)=g(\ell,n)$ and $g(-\ell,n)=\overline{g(\ell,n)}$, where $\bar{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z\in\mathbb{C}$.  Thus, it suffices to evaluate $g(\ell,n)$ for integers $\ell$ with $0\leq \ell\leq \frac{n}{2}$.  The value of $g(\ell,n)$ is of great interest for integers $\ell$ with $\gcd(\ell,n)=1$. If the claim (*) is true, then I can find the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the (inverse) discrete Fourier transform matrix $\mathbf{A}$ in my answer here with $\omega:=\omega_n$.  That is, $+\sqrt{n}$ will have multiplicity $\left\lfloor\frac{n+4}{4}\right\rfloor$, $-\sqrt{n}$ will be of multiplicity $\left\lfloor\frac{n+2}{4}\right\rfloor$, $+\sqrt{n}\text{i}$ will be of multiplicity $\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}{4}\right\rfloor$, and $-\sqrt{n}\text{i}$ will be of multiplicity $\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{4}\right\rfloor$.  I am sure there are different approaches of getting these multiplicities, but I would like to see how the sum above is evaluated. Notes: The only case in (*) I am able to prove is when $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$.  That is because $$\omega^{(k+n/2)^2}=-\omega^{k^2}$$ for any primitive $n$-th root of unity $\omega$ and for all $k=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1$.  Consequently, if $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$, then $g(\ell,n)=0$ for all $\ell\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $\gcd(\ell,n)=1$. i707107 has provided me with a great reference.  Hence, I no longer need a proof for (*), except a different proof.  However, I will still greatly appreciate if anybody can determine $g(\ell,n)$ for $\ell\not\equiv\pm1\pmod{n}$.

As for the remaining two dimensions, I am unsure of how to continue.

1892135,About a mysterious sequence who seems to follow some patterns,"This question is maybe linked to this other question . We can prove using the density of some additives sub-groups of $\mathbb R$ that we can approach an integer with a rational of the form $\displaystyle \frac{2^a}{3^b}$ . For a given integer $n$ , let's get interesting of the approximation of this form with $b \ge 0$ and $a$ minimal: $$\left\lfloor \frac{2^a}{3^b}\right\rfloor=n \qquad b \ge 0 \text{ and } a \text{ is minimal},$$ where $\lfloor.\rfloor$ denotes the floor function. The term minimal here is meaning that we are interesting in a couple $(a,b)$ like that, such that every other $(a',b')$ couple like that won't match the condition if $a'<a$ . Definition 1 We denote $(p_n)_{n\geq 1}$ the sequence defined by $$\forall n\geq 1, \quad p(n):=a+b$$ where $a$ and $b$ are such that $$\left\lfloor \frac{2^a}{3^b}\right\rfloor=n \text{ and } a \text{ is minimal}.$$ We call $p(n)$ the poids of $n$ . With that being said, let's look up at what this sequence look like. For $n$ from $1$ to $100$ : $n$ from $1$ to $100$ "" /> For $n$ from $1$ to $1000$ : From these two first graphs of the poids $p$ , we can see some kind of patterns. Which seems at the same time very regular and predictable, but also a little random, with holes and extra unexpected points. But let's look up the sequence a little further. For $n$ from $1$ to $2000$ : We now see a huge explosion of the poids around $1000$ , a pattern getting more and more regular on the bottom, and apparent randomness on the top. And something which look like a gap just a little before $2000$ . We must scale down to see the big picture. For $n$ from $1$ to $1000$ : What a different graph. There is a pattern of waves appearing now above the initial bottom (we can clearly see the $1000$ explosion now). The wave-pattern seems to get more regular with $n$ growing. To understand if it goes like this forever, we need to scale down even more. For $n$ from $1$ to $22000$ : Now the wave-pattern is disappearing around $15000$ to another kind of pattern. For $n$ from $1$ to $24000$ : We have another explosion of the poids a little before $24000$ . Let's go further (but don't take credit of the $x$ -axis, it is wrong, my bad... I couldn't display the full picture, computation starting to get really big at this point). For $n$ from $24000$ to $32000$ : I have personally trouble imagining we are looking at the very same sequence at this point. We know have two layers, just like we did right after the first explosion at $1000$ . A very regular layer on the bottom, and some beautiful waves on the top. The waves gaining one ""wave"" each time they appear. We want to look more precisely at the sequence, so we construct its values for $n\in [40000, 40500]$ . For $n$ from $40000$ to $40500$ : Finally we highlighted the multiple of $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , and $6$ , and some interesting things can be observed. We also highlighted the prime numbers as a curiosity, but I found nothing from there. The multiples of $2$ : The multiples of $3$ : The multiples of $5$ : The multiples of $6$ : The prime numbers: Well, now that we had a good look at this amazing sequence, let's try to do some maths. Here it is what I've proven so far (not much i fear, but I can send you proofs if requested). Theorem 1 We have $$\forall n\geq 1,\quad \log_2(n)\le p(n).$$ Which leads to: Corollary 1 We have $$p(n)\xrightarrow[n\to+\infty]{} +\infty.$$ But also: Theorem 2 : We have $$\forall k\geq 2,\quad p(k)= \min\{p(2k)-1\ ,\  p(2k-1)-1\}.$$ I haven't actually proven the following, but i do think it's true: Theorem 3 : We have $$\forall k\geq 2,\quad p(k)\leq p(3k)+1.$$ I have a lot of questions about this sequence, and I hope you do to. Anything which could help understand this sequence better, and any result about it would be much appreciated. Edit As requested, I am going to ask some specifics questions. Though any result would be great. I think it would be natural to have a formula of the form $$p(n)+p(m)\leq p(nm)$$ which would be valid ""most of the time"". I don't succeed in producing a proof though. I would like to know what is the function being the better upper bound (it looks like a combinaison of several logarithms).

1892253,Various $p$-adic integrals,"Here are three (possibly different) definitions of $p$-adic integrals that I have encountered during my self-studies.
First of all, here is what Vladimirov, Volovich and Zelenov write at the beginning of their book on mathematical physics: As the field $\mathbb Q_p$ is a locally compact commutative group with
  respect to addition then in $\mathbb Q_p$ there exists the Haar
  measure, a positive measure $dx$ which is invariant to shifts. We
  normalize the measure $dx$ such that $\int_{|x|_p \le 1} dx = 1.$
  Under such agreement the measure is unique. For any compact $K \subseteq \mathbb Q_p$ the measure $dx$ defines a positive linear
  continuous functional on $C(K)$ by the formula $\int_K f(x) dx$. A
  function $f \in \mathcal L^1_{\textrm{loc}}$ is called integrable on
  $\mathbb Q_p$ if there exists $$\lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{B(N)} f(x)dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{\gamma = -N}^\infty \int_{S(-\gamma)} f(x) dx.$$ Their denote by $B(N)$ the set $\{x \in \mathbb Q_p : |x|_p \le p^N \}$ and $S(\gamma)$ is defined as $B(\gamma) \setminus B(\gamma-1)$.
Next we have the famous Volkenborn integral, described as follows by Robert: We say that $f$ is strictly differentiable at a point $a \in X$ - and
  denote this property by $f \in \mathcal S^1(a)$ - if the difference
  quotients $[f(x) - f(y)]/(x-y)$ have a limit as $(x, y) \to (a,a)$
  ($x$ and $y$ remaining distinct). By the way, $\mathcal S^1(X) := \bigcap_{a \in X} \mathcal S^1(a)$.
  The Volkenborn integral of a function $f \in \mathcal S^1(\mathbb Z_p)$ is by definition $$\int_{\mathbb Z_p} f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to
 \infty} \frac{1}{p^n} \sum_{j=0}^{p^n-1} f(j).$$ Finally a quote from Koblitz book ""$p$-adic numbers, analysis and $\zeta$-functions"": Now let $X$ be a compact-open subset of $\mathbb Q_p$. A $p$-adic distribution $\mu$ on $X$ is a $\mathbb Q_p$-linear vector space homomorphism from the $\mathbb Q_p$-vector space of locally constant functions on $X$ to $\mathbb Q_p$. Later he states that for $p$-adic measures (distributions that are bounded on compact-open subsets by some constant) and continuous functions $f$ there is a reasonable way to define $\mu(f) =: \int_X f \mu$.
Cassels is confusing me even more as he mentions Shnirelman. So, here are my actual questions: Do these ultrametric integrals have real analogues like: being a limit of Riemannian sums or an operation inverse to differentiation? Are they compatible to each other? Is any of them a generalization of the others? What are the positive and negative attributes of the cited definitions? Where can I find an exhaustive table of integrals? I'm mainly interested in something similar to https://www.tug.org/texshowcase/cheat.pdf .

Because $f$ is unramified, $\Omega{X/Y} = 0$, and so the contangent exact sequence yields: $$f^* \Omega_{Y/k} \rightarrow \Omega_{X/k} \rightarrow 0.$$ Because $Y$ is smooth we now have a surjection from a locally free sheaf of rank $n$. I'm not sure where to go from here. If this is left-exact, then by 6.2.10 in Qing Liu $f$ would be étale, which seems too strong.

A deeper interpretation of a $n \times n$ matrix, I would believe, would be that it is an element of a vector space, e.g. $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ as you need $n^2$ linear equations to compute each entry in the matrix (a dot product for each entry) Now if you use that interpretation of a matrix, then let's assume we have a column vector $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ and it's transpose, a row vector, $B^T \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times n}$ $$\begin{align}B = \begin{bmatrix}

A, B, C, and D are just constants. $\textbf{M}_1$ and $\textbf{M}_2$ are two vectors and their derivative over time (t) has such relation. Since the magnitude of $\textbf{M}_1$ and $\textbf{M}_2$ is unchanged over time, and I am only interested in the change of $\theta$ and $\phi$ of both vectors, so I want to express the equations in spherical coordinates and use unit vectors of $\theta$ and $\phi$.

(In my case, $\theta_{1,2}$ is the angle between $\textbf{M}_{1,2}$ and +z direction, ${\phi}_{1,2}$ is the angle of $\textbf{M}_{1,2}$ with +x direction on x-y plane.) The left side of the equations can thus be re-written as: $$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\textbf{M}_1}{\mathrm{d}t}=M_1(\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta_1}{\mathrm{d}t}\hat{\theta}_1+\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_1}{\mathrm{d}t}\sin\theta_1\hat{\phi}_1) \\

$$ But I can’t express the right side of the equations to similar expression with $\hat{\theta}_1$, $\hat{\phi}_1$, $\hat{\theta}_2$ and $\hat{\phi}_2$. So my question is, can we express the items on the right side as similar as the left side of the differential equations?
