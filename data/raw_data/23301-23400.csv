201955,Lemma about the integral of a function with compact support,"Lemma 16.4 (p. 140) of Munkres' Analysis on Manifolds says: Let $A$ be open in $\mathbb{R}^n$; let $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. If $f$ vanishes outside a compact subset $C$ of $A$, then the integrals $\int_A f$ and $\int_C f$ exist and are equal. The first step in his proof is saying that the integral $\int_C f$ exists because $C$ is bounded and $f$ is continuous and bounded on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$. But don't you need $C$ to be rectifiable (i.e. bounded and boundary has measure $0$) for integrability? The fat cantor set is compact but not rectifiable, so the integral over it won't exist.","['integration', 'real-analysis']"

202017,Cauchy transform,"I'm trying to solve the problem:

Cauchy transform
$$C\phi(z) =\frac 1{2\pi i}\int_{S_1(0)}\frac{\phi(w)}{w-z}dw$$
is analytic on $\Bbb C \setminus S_1(0)$. If $\phi$ is holomorphic on closure of $B_1(0)$ then it follows from Cauchy's formula that
$$C\phi(z) = \begin{cases}\phi(z)& \mbox{if }z \in B_1(0);\\0&\mbox{if }z \in C\setminus B_1(0).\end{cases}$$
What happens if $\phi(z) =\bar z$? Hint: On the unit circle $\bar z = 1/z$. I tried to substitute in the integral by $\phi(w)=1/w$ and solve the integral by writing it as $(-1/zw + 1/z(w-z))$. I got the integral is $\log$, but I'm not sure at all of my solution. Can anyone please help me?

I know that for a finite dimensional smooth manifold M, $T_pM$ will be isomorphic to the model space (i.e if M is m dimensional, then $T_pM \cong \mathbb{R}^m$). Further more, I know that $T_pM$ can be identified with the equivalence classes of curves on M under the relation: For $\gamma, \, \gamma' \in C^\infty((-\epsilon,\epsilon), M)$ with \gamma(o) = p, $\quad$ $\gamma \sim \gamma'$ iff  $\dot{\gamma(0)} = \dot{\gamma'(o)}.$ Define a path in $F$ to be a map $C:M\times[0,1] \rightarrow N$ with $C(x,t) = C_t(x)$ such that $C_0(x) = f, \, C_1(x) = g, \, C_{t_0}(x) \text{ is smooth for all } t_0 \in [0,1], \text{ and } C_{t}(x_0) \text{ is smooth for all } x_0 \in M.$ After a little work, ones sees that for some $f \in F, \, T_{f}F = \Gamma_f(M, TN)$ which I have proved is (set)isomorphic to $\Gamma(M, f^{*}TN)$ where $f^{*}TN$ denotes the pullback bundle.

I am analyzing the following experiment: Pick an $x \in \{0,\ldots,2k\}$ uniformly at random Pick $(2k+1)$-bit bitstring $b_1=(u,v_1)$ uniformly at random Pick a $(2k+1-x)$-bit bitstring $v_2$ uniformly at random What is the probability that the majority function of $b_2 = (u,v_2)$  is bigger than the majority function of $b_1 = (u,v_1)$? It can be analyzed as follows. Define the random variables: $X \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(\{0,\ldots,2k\})$ $Y(x) \sim \operatorname{Binom}(x,\frac{1}{2})$ $Z_1(x),Z_2(x) \sim\operatorname{Binom}(2k+1-x,\frac{1}{2})$ What is: $\Pr[Y(X) + Z_1(X) \leq k \wedge Y(X) + Z_2(X) \geq k+1]$? The challenge of the problem is easiest shown by fixing a specific $x$, and calculating: $\Pr[Y(x) + Z_1(x) \leq k \wedge Y(x) + Z_2(x) \geq k+1]$ $= \sum_{y=0}^x \Pr[Y(x) = y] \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y] \Pr[Z(x) \geq k+1-y]$ $= \sum_{y=0}^x \Pr[Y(x) = y] \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y] (1 - \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y])$ $= \Pr[Y(x) + Z(x) \leq k] -\sum_{y=0}^x  \Pr[Y(x) = y] \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y]^2$ $= \frac{1}{2} -\sum_{y=0}^x  \Pr[Y(x) = y] \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y]^2$ where we just let $Z_1=Z_2=Z$ after the dependence has been removed. But how to go on from here? If we let $f(k,x) = \sum_{y=0}^x  \Pr[Y(x) = y] \Pr[Z(x) \leq k-y]^2$ $g(k,x) = \frac{1}{4}(1 + \frac{x}{2k+1})$ Then a plot from maple suggests that $g(k,x) \geq f(k,x)$ for all values that we consider. img http://sorenhaagerup.dk/files/f_and_g.jpg How can I show that $g$ is an upper bound to $f$? I tried all kinds of things - everything from rewriting to expressions about the variance of some complicated variable, to trying out different induction strategies. If successfully proven, it will result in the lower bound $$\Pr[Y(x) + Z_1(x) \leq k \wedge Y(x) + Z_2(x) \geq k+1] \geq  \frac{1}{2} -  \frac{1}{4}\left(1 + \frac{x}{2k+1}\right)$$ Taking the average over all $x \in \{0,\ldots, 2k\}$, we end up with a lower bound on the expectation of $\frac{1}{2k+1} \sum_{x=0}^{2k} (\frac{1}{2} -  \frac{1}{4}(1 + \frac{x}{2k+1})) = \frac{1}{4} \frac{k+1}{2k+1} \geq \frac{1}{8}$.","['probability-theory', 'computer-science', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

$$ \zeta(1+z) - {1 \over z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k { s_k \over k! } z^k \tag1$$ 
or better with reversed sign of the argument z:
$$ \zeta(1-z) + {1 \over z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { s_k \over k! } z^k \tag{1.1} $$ because the rhs looks like the inner term in the Borel-summation-method for the Stieltjes-constant, where the integral-term was cancelled. So we might, with wikipedia, say, that  $ \zeta(1-z)+{1 \over z}$ is the Borel-transform of my wished sum $ S = \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_k $ So I think, that the correct Borel-sum computation using that $\zeta$-expression is by
$$ S = \int_0^\infty \exp(-t) (\zeta(1-tz)+{1\over tz}) dt | _{z=1} \tag2 $$ Feeding this into Pari/GP the integral seems to diverge; we can go to 12 or 13 for the upper bound of the integral to arrive at about S~0.499074922658 but increasing that upper bound further then the numerical integration ""begins to diverge"" (I got the same value using another method for summation, but again only as partial sum, after which the summation-procedure ""begins to diverge"") So this would indicate, that the Borel-summation is not sufficient for this, but possibly the value 0.499074... is a legitimate approximation.

You must consider all four properties when determining the validity of a Set. Hence the following are Sets: One Lined Red Diamond, Two Lined Green Diamonds, and Three Lined Purple Diamonds One Solid Green Oval, One Solid Green Diamond, One Solid Green Squiggle One Lined Purple Squiggle, Two Solid Red Diamonds, Three Open Green Ovals. And, just for kicks, the following is not a Set: One Open Green Diamond, Two Lined Green Diamonds, and Two Solid Green Diamonds; the number property does not pass the test (1, 2, 2) The game is played by one or more players placing twelve cards (random, from a shuffled deck) face up on a flat area.  When a player sees a Set, s/he calls ""Set"" and indicates the three cards, collects them from the table, and the dealer replaces them.  When the deck runs out, and no more Sets are possible, whoever has the most Sets wins. Hopefully you have the gist of it now.  Here's the question again, in light of the rules: given a shuffled 81-card deck, when you lay out $n$ cards face up on a table, what is the probability of a Set existing on the table? I have been able to figure it out to five cards, but past that, I get lost.  I'll post what I have in an answer, because it's part of the answer, but what I really want to know is whether there's an easier way to do it.  Otherwise it could take me a long time, no kidding.","['card-games', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
202877,Covariance of Gaussian stochastic process,"Could someone help me to figure out solutions of following problems?: Let $X = (X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a Gaussian, zero-mean stochastic process starting from $0$, i.e. $X_0 = 0$. Moreover, assume that the process has stationary increments,
meaning that for all $t_1 \geq s_1, t_2 \geq s_2, ... , t_n \geq s_n$, the distribution of the vector $(X_{t_1} - X_{s_1} , ... ,X_{t_n} - X_{s_n})$ only depends on the time points through the differences $t_1 - s_1, ... , t_n - s_n$. $(a)$ Show that for all $s, t \geq 0$ $$EX_sX_t =1/2 (v(s) + v(t) - v(|t - s|))$$ where the function $v$ is given by $v(t) = EX^2_t$ $(b)$ In addition to stationarity of the increments we now assume that $X$ is $H$-self similar for some parameter $H > 0$. Recall that this means that for every $a > 0$, the process $(X_{at})_t$ has the same finite dimensional distributions as $(a^HX_t)_t$. Show that the variance function $v(t) = EX^2_t$ must be of the form $v(t) = Ct^{2H}$ for some constant $C>0$. $(c)$ In view of the $(a),(b)$ we now assume that $X$ is a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance function $EX_sX_t = 1/2(s^{2H} + t^{2H} - |t - s|^{2H})$ for some $H > 0$. Show that we must have $H \leq 1$. (Hint: you may use that by Cauchy-Schwarz, the (semi-)metric $d(s, t) = \sqrt{ E(X_s - X_t)^2}$ on $[0, 1)$ satisfies the triangle inequality). $(d)$ Show that for $H = 1$, we have $X_t = tZ$ a.s., for a standard normal random variable $Z$ not depending on $t$. $(e)$ Show that for every value of the parameter $H \in (0, 1]$, the process $X$ has a continuous modification. For now I have some ideas about $(a)$ and $(d)$ but have no clue about $(b), (c), (e)$ For $(a)$ my reasoning would be as follows: $$EX_sX_t = E[(X_s-X_t)+X_t][(X_t - X_s)+X_s]$$ 
$$=-E(X_s-X_t)^2+E(X_s-X_t)X_s+EX_t(X_t-X_s)+EX_tX_s$$
$$=-E(X_s-X_t)^2+EX_s^2-EX_tX_s+EX_t^2-EX_tX_s+EX_tX_s$$ so we get $$EX_sX_t=1/2 (v(s) + v(t) - E(X_s-X_t)^2)$$ but how to show that $E(X_s-X_t)^2 = v(|t - s|)$? I would say that if $s \leq t$ then $E(X_s-X_t)^2 = E(X_{t-s}-X_0)^2= E(X_{t-s})^2=v(t - s)$ and by symmetry in the case of $s \geq t$ we get $E(X_s-X_t)^2 = v(|t - s|)$. Is this correct? For $(d)$ I think in this way: If $H=1$ then $EX_sX_t = 1/2(s^{2H} + t^{2H} - |t - s|^{2H})$ simplyfies to $1/2(s^2 + t^2 - |t - s|^2)$ and this is equal to $st$ on the other hand $EtZsZ=stEZ^2=st$ in the case of $Z$ being standard Gaussian. Because we are talking about Gaussian proccess it is described by mean $(=0)$ and covariance (st) we are done. Is this the right way? As I wrote above I have no reasonable ideas about $(b), (c), (e)$.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-analysis']"
