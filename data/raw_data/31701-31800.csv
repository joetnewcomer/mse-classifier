298388,Period Homomorphisms and closed 1-forms,"This is from Otto Forster's ""lectures on Riemann Surfaces"", on integration of forms. Let $\Gamma = \alpha_1 \mathbb{Z} + \alpha_2 \mathbb{Z}$ be a lattice in $\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{C}$ and are lin. independent over $\mathbb{R}$), and $X := \mathbb{C} / \Gamma$ a torus.   Given any homomorphism (of groups)
\begin{equation*}
a: \pi_1(X) \to \mathbb{C}
\end{equation*}
show that there exists a closed 1-form $\omega \in \mathcal{E}^1(X)$ (smooth 1-forms on $X$) whose period homomorphism is equal to $a$. My Attempt (so far): So first off, recall that the ""period homomorphism"" of a closed 1-form $\omega \in \mathcal{E}^1(X)$ is the map
\begin{equation*}
\gamma \mapsto \int_\gamma \omega  \quad \text{   $\gamma \in \pi_1(X)$}
\end{equation*}
(which is nice and well-defined, since the integral of a closed 1-form is invariant under homotopic deformations of $\gamma$).  Since $\pi_1(X) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, the given map $a$ is uniquely determined by the images of the two fundamental cycles, which are the images of the two curves $\gamma_i: [0,1] \to \mathbb{C}$ given by $t \mapsto t\alpha_i$, under the canonical projection $p: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}/\Gamma$. What I want to do is find some nice function $F : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ that is additively automorphic (w/ constant summands of automorphy) under $\text{Deck}(\mathbb{C}/ X)$ so that there exists a closed 1-form $\omega \in \mathcal{E}^1(X)$ such that $dF = p^*\omega$.  For then we have 
\begin{equation*}
\int_{p \circ \gamma_i} \omega = \int_{\gamma_i} dF = F(\alpha_i)-F(0)
\end{equation*}
and by (maybe) scaling $F$ in different ways, I can force the integral to be equal to $a(p \circ \gamma_i)$. Or am I way off?  Anybody?","['differential-forms', 'riemann-surfaces', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
298403,Motivation for linear transformations,"Sometimes I hate classes for mathematicians. It is not their precision and formality in building the concepts,  but they never give a motivation. So in the course my professor started right with the definition of vector space, assuming I suppose that everybody knows what he is talking about. Well, reading some books for beginners like me I've realized that vector spaces are actually a generalization of working with the properties of Euclidean spaces. Now the topic is about linear transformations. I understand the definition, they are special cases of mappings. Well, the thing is that I don't know why the definition has to be so, what is the real motivation for such a definition?. what is behind the meaning of 'linear'? My first impression is that maybe it has something to do with just preserving the operations of vectors, though I don't know why. What makes linear transformations to be special compared with those that are not linear?

I would like to make sure that I am using the Leiniz Integral Rule correctly.  Various web sources indicate a set of conditions that must hold for $f(x,a)$ and $\frac{\partial f(x,a)}{\partial a}$ when integration is done over infinite region.  From reading this source (see Theorem 10.3 on page 13) the conditions that $f(x,a)$ and $\frac{\partial f(x,a)}{\partial a}$ must obey are: $f(x,a)$ and $\frac{\partial f(x,a)}{\partial a}$ are continuous over $x\in[0,\infty)$ and around $a$ that we are interested in. There exists an integrable function (over $x$) $g(x)$ such that $|\frac{\partial f(x,a)}{\partial a}|\leq g(x)$. There exists an integrable function (over $x$) $h(x)$ such that $|f(x,a)|\leq h(x)$. Integrable here means $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)dx<\infty$. However, another source seems to omit condition 3 above.  I am wondering which source is correct.

298512,numerical linear algebra tricks for repeated sums and inversions with symmetric positive-definite matrices,"I'm doing the following procedure to get the max-likelihood estimate of a matrix-variate normal distribution from $r$ samples of matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ (algorithm from Dutilleul (1999) ): $$
\begin{align}
V &= \frac{1}{r n} \sum_{i=1}^r X_i^T U^{-1} X_i \\
U &= \frac{1}{r p} \sum_{i=1}^r X_i V^{-1} X_i^T
\end{align}
$$ and repeating until convergence. ($U \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$).
I need to do this for moderately large $n$ and $p$ (on the order of 1,000 each), with somewhat smaller $r$ (order of 200), and I need to do it over and over and over again, so any algorithmic speed increases would be very handy. That paper didn't really talk about the practical implementation of the algorithm, though. Since $U$ and $V$ are symmetric positive-definite, it seems that there should be some trick smarter than just doing the sums as written (using a solve call rather than an inverse and multiply for the right half, of course). Currently, I'm not exploiting the SPD-ness at all. I can Cholesky-factorize $U$ and $V$ before doing each sum and then using a solver that exploits that, which will presumably save some work in the sum over $i$. Is it possible to just directly get a Cholesky-style factor of $U$ and $V$ in the sum, rather than the full matrix? The outer-product-with-an-spd-matrix-in-the-middle form is super tempting for that, but of course the sum means you can't just add together the Cholesky factors of each summand. Can I exploit some structure here, more than just doing $X_i$ times the result of a LU solver for $U^{-1} X_i$? Would it maybe be better to do $L_U^{-1} X_i$ and outer product that with itself, for example, or something smarter? As it turns out, I don't actually need $U$ and $V$, just $\det(V \otimes U) = \det(U)^n \det(V)^p$. Is there some shortcut I can take that'll get the determinants out without having to do as much work?

Can anyone please comment whether my proof is correct or not? Attempted solution: If $\det A=0$ , the $A$ is non-invertible. We know that a matrix is invertible iff $A^T$ is invertible. As $A$ is non-invertible, so is $A^T$ and therefore $\det A^T=0$ . If the matrix is invertible, then $A=E_rE_{r-1}\dots E_1$ for a finite sequence of elementary row operations, $E_i$ . Using the fact that $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$ and using induction, we infer that $A^T=E_1^TE_2^T\dots E_r^T$ . So, $\det A^T=\det (E_1^T)\det(E_2^T)\dots \det(E_r^T)$ .As $E_i^T$ is an elementary row-operation as well of the same kind, $\det E_i^T=\det E_i$ .

Note: This is self-study -- not homework. My thoughts: I tried to exploit certain configurations of $L_1$ and $L_2$ and apply the reflection principle to show that the function vanishes on a closed curve and hence everywhere, but I wasn't successful. OK, I think I have a working argument. Let $u$ be a real harmonic function that vanishes on two lines $L_1$ and $L_2$. Apply the necessary translation and/or rotation to make $L_1$ match $y = 0$ and the intersection point (if any) match (0, 0). This will translate/rotate the set of zeros of $u$, but it won't remove or introduce new zeros. The resulting function will remain real and harmonic. If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel, then $L_2$ is of the form $y = a$ and, by a direct computation of the Laplacian, the following function satisfies the requirements: $$u(x, y) = e^x \sin\left(\frac{2\pi y}{a}\right)$$ If $L_1$ and $L_2$ intersect at an angle $\theta = 2\pi\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \Bbb N, q \ne 0$, the following function satisfies the requirements: $$u(x, y) = \prod_{k=0}^{q-1}\left(y-x \tan\left(2\pi k \frac{p}{q}\right)\right)$$ Otherwise, $L_1$ and $L_2$ intersect at an angle $\theta = 2 \pi s$ where $s \not \in \Bbb Q$. By the Schwarz reflection principle, the function also vanishes on $\overline L_2$. With repeated rotations and applications of the reflection principle, we find that a rotation of the function has zeros in the following set: $$y = x \tan(2 \pi s n), \ n \in \Bbb N$$ But the set is dense because $s \not \in \Bbb Q$. Hence the function is identically zero. My question: Any mistakes in my argument? Is there an easier way?","['harmonic-functions', 'complex-analysis']"

$$
\exp(A)=(\cos\sqrt{\det A})\mathbb{I}+\frac{\sin\sqrt{\det A}}{\sqrt{\det A}}A
$$
Suppose $X$ is an arbitrary matrix, say $X=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, then $X$ can be written as a sum:
$$
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}=\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{a-d}{2} & b \\ c & -\frac{a-d}{2}\end{pmatrix}}_{T}+\underbrace{\frac{a+d}{2}\mathbb{I}}_{S}
$$
Notice that $TS=ST$, so $\exp(X)=\exp(T)\exp(S)$. Since $T$ is traceless I can use the formula and write $\exp(T)$ in terms of its determinant, but my final result needs to depend on determinant and trace of $X$ only, so
$$
\det T=\frac{a-d}{2}\cdot\frac{d-a}{2}-bc=-\frac{a^2+d^2}{2}+ad-bc=-\frac{a^2+d^2}{2}+\det X

It is Proposition 17.8 on Page 213. The Proposition goes as: Every continuous map $f:M\rightarrow N$ between two manifolds is continuously homotopic to a differentiable mapping. The proof basically goes as: First assume $N=\mathbb{R}$, then it is more or less obvious. Then for general $N$, by invoking Whitney Embedding Theorem, $N$ can be embedding into a $\mathbb{R}^k$ when $k$ is big enough. That is, $\exists g:N\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$smooth. Then the author made a remark which I don't see why: If $g\circ f:M\rightarrow g(N)\subset \mathbb{R}^k$ is homotopic to a differentiable mapping, so is $f=g^{-1}\circ (g\circ f):M\rightarrow N$. Here is the part I don't see why. How does the the author guarantee that the differentiable mapping homotopic to $g\circ f$ won't assume value in $\mathbb{R}^k\setminus g(N)$, thus making it impossible to take it back by applying $g^{-1}$.

It is that the following is an equivalent characterization of chain connectedness for a metric space $M$: Point-wise boundedness at a point of an equicontinuous family of functions (from M to the real numbers) implies pointwise boundedness at all points. Pointwise boundedness means boundedness of the set of values of all functions at a given point. Now, my attempt was to construct an equicontinuous family of functions that could be useful. For instance, you can take $A$ be the set of all points chain connected to the point $a\in M$. Then you can take $f_n$ defined as $0$ on $A$ and $n$ otherwise. The functions $f_n$ are bounded at $a$, so equicontinuity would give us the desired result. The challenge I'm facing is showing equicontinuity. Plus, it does not seem like a good choice of functions. For instance, take $$M=\{r\in\mathbb R\, |\, r<0, r=0 \text{ or } r=1/n \text{ for all }n \text{  natural}\}.$$ Use the standard Euclidean metric on $\mathbb R$. Take $a=0$. It seems like you can find $x$ and $y$ arbitrarily close such that $f_n(x)$ and $f_n(y)$ still differ by $n$. Thank you! So I think the example I gave shows that the distances between A and the rest of the chain connected components can have a zero infimum, which is what makes me skeptical that this will work.

Are real numbers only rational and irrational? if so then do we have to say what are rational and irrational and please it cant have a lot of math involved in it (even if it sounds silly). Like say I am in uni or maybe you as a graduate of a university you want to explain to your niece, your little brother that is what I want like I know the good hard theorems but he wont get it. So i want to simply break it down for someone who wants to know what a real number actually is so this is what i have so far So basically say you are a non math person and this is my explanation would it be valid.
So a real number is basically any number that you can think of, let it be decimal numbers, rational numbers which are just fractions, irrational numbers. Real numbers can range anywhere from $\infty$ to $-\infty$
where $\infty$ is the highest number you can think of in your imagination and $-\infty$ is the lowest number you can think of in your imagination. Like numbers really dont end say the biggest number is $1000000000000000000000000000000000000000$ but there is a number bigger than that like $1000000000000000000000000000000000000000$, or the lowest number you can think of is $-1000000000000000000000000000000000000000$ what about $-2000000000000000000000000000000000000000$, etc real numbers are never ending",['algebra-precalculus']

299210,Recursion for Finding Expectation (Somewhat Lengthy),"Preface: Ever since I read the brilliant answer by Mike Spivey I have been on a mission for re-solving all my probability questions with it when possible. I tried solving the Coupon Collector problem using Recursion which the community assisted on another question of mine. Now, I think I have come close to completely understanding the way of using recursion. But..... Question: This is from Stochastic Processes by Sheldon Ross (Page  49, Question 1.14). The question is: A fair die is continually rolled until an even number has appeared on 10 distinct rolls. Let $X_i$ denote the number of rolls that land on side $i$. Determine : $E[X_1]$ $E[X_2]$ PMF of $X_1$ PMF of $X_2$ My Attempt: Building on my previous question, I begin: Let $N$ denote the total number of throws (Random Variable) and let
$Z_{i}$ denote the result of the $i^{th}$ throw. Then: \begin{eqnarray*}
E(X_{1}) & = & E\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}1_{Z_{i}=1}\right)\\
 & = & E\left[E\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}1_{Z_{i}=1}|N\right)\right]\\
E(X_{1}|N) & = & E(1_{Z_{1}=1}+1_{Z_{2}=1}+\cdots+1_{z_{N}=1})\\
 & = & \frac{N-10}{3}\\
E(X_{1}) & = & \frac{E(N)-10}{3}
\end{eqnarray*} To Find : $E(N)$ Let $W_{i}$ be the waiting time for the $i^{th}$ distinct roll of
an even number. Then: $$E(N)=\sum_{i=1}^{10}E(W_{i})$$ Now, \begin{eqnarray*}
E(W_{i}) & = & \frac{1}{2}(1)+\frac{1}{2}(1+E(W_{i}))\\
E(W_{i}) & = & 1+\frac{E(W_{i})}{2}\\
\implies E(W_{i}) & = & 2\\
\therefore E(N) & = & \sum_{i=1}^{10}2\\
 & = & 20\\
\therefore E(X_{1}) & = & \frac{10}{3}\\
 &  & \blacksquare
\end{eqnarray*} The exact same procedure can be followed for $E(X_2)$ with the same answer. The answer matches the one given in the book. I am confused how to go from here to get the PMFs. Note : If possible, please provide me an extension to this answer for finding the PMFs rather than a completely different method. The book has the answer at the back using a different method. I am not interested in an answer as much as I am interested in knowing how to continue this attempt to get the PMFs.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

First we observe that

that is, an integral over an interval symmetrical about the origin; without taking roads for the search of all the primitives, and by exploiting the symmetry of the interval, we check if the function is odd, in that case one can immediately conclude that the value of 'integral is $ 0 $, then we have: therefore, the integral is, that $ f (x) $ the integrand, \begin{align}
f(-x)&= \frac{\displaystyle\sin (-x)\frac{\sqrt{\sin^2(\cos (-x))+\pi e^{((-x)^4)}}}{1+((-x)e^{\cos (-x)}\sin (-x))^2}+2\sin((-x)^2+2)\arctan\left(\frac{(-x)^3}{3}\right)}{\displaystyle 1+e^{-\frac{(-x)^2}{2}}+(-x)^7 \sin(-\pi (-x))+\frac{12}{11}|(-x)|^{2\pi+1}}\\
