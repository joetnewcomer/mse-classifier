1765192,"In Egorov's Theorem, is almost everywhere same as point-wise?","I am studying about Egorov's Theorem. My teaching assistant said to me that Egorov's theorem is roughly like the following statement: Under two conditions which are $|E|\lt+\infty$ and $|f|\lt+\infty$ ,
$$f_k \to f ~~\text{point-wisely} \Longrightarrow f_k \to f ~~\text{uniformly}$$ In the textbook, there is no word about point-wise. The definition of textbook version is like the following: Egorov's Theorem. Suppose that $\{f_k\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions which converges almost everywhere in a set $E$ of finite measure to a finite limit $f$. Then given $\varepsilon\gt0$, there is a closed subset $F$ of $E$ such that $|E-F| \lt \varepsilon$ and $\{f_k\}$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $F$. I am not sure that almost everywhere is considered as pointwise. Can someone tell me which are same or different? If they are different, please give a counter example. Although I know the definition of each of them, I cannot make example. :(","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'uniform-convergence']"
1765218,Existence of Derivative for an Integral,"Let $f$ be a Riemann integrable function defined on $[-2,2]$.

1765221,When can we recover a topology from its connected sets?,"Definition. Let $X$ denote a set. Whenever $\tau$ is a topology on $X$, write $\tilde{\tau}$ for the collection of subsets of $X$ that are connected from the viewpoint of the space $(X,\tau)$. In general, we cannot recover $\tau$ from $\tilde{\tau}$. For instance, let $\tau$ denote the usual topology on $\mathbb{Q}$, and $\sigma$ denote the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\tilde{\tau} = \tilde{\sigma}$, but $\tau \not = \sigma$. I'm wondering whether we can use local connectedness to get rid of this problem. Question. Let $X$ denote a set. Suppose $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are topologies on $X.$ Suppose $(X,\tau)$ and $(X,\sigma)$ are locally connected spaces. From $\tilde{\tau} = \tilde{\sigma}$, can we deduce $\tau = \sigma$? If not, can we replace local connectedness with something else, so that from $\tilde{\tau} = \tilde{\sigma}$, we can deduce $\tau = \sigma$?","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

For unbounded operators it is known that isolated spectral points are either poles or essential singularities, and every pole is an eigenvalue. Thus, I need an explicit operator $T$ with $\lambda \in \sigma(T)$ such that $\lambda$ is an essential singularity (and not a pole) of the resolvent operator of $T$.

1765282,Does the PNT establish a connection between primes and the logarithm?,"The prime number theorem states that $$\pi(x) \sim \frac x {\ln(x)}$$ Morally, this seems to suggest that there is a fundamental connection between primes and the natural logarithm. But since we're just dealing with asymptotics here, the choice of right hand side is not unique. In fact, we have $$\pi(x) \sim \frac x {\ln(x)} + f(x)$$ For any $f\in o(\frac x {\ln(x)})$. What if the appearance of $\ln$ here is just an artefact of the specific method used to prove the PNT? Maybe for a suitable choice of $f$ you could make it looks like the primes have a deep connection to any function you like. Is there any argument that could in some sense show that $\ln$ is not arbitrary here?","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'soft-question']"

1765344,f left continuous & strictly increasing; B Borel $\implies$ f(B) Borel (or at least Lebesgue Measurable)?,"How's it going? In an attempt to use the Radon-Nykodym theorem to bulldoze through the admission of measures by bounded variation & monotonic functions (sidestepping all that Caratheodory machinery), I have stumbled upon the question in the title. It is clear that a strictly increasing left continuous function f may be decomposed into a continuous and a jump function, where the jump function is countably supported and hence $f=\lim_ig_c+g_{s,i}=\lim_ih_i$ where each jump function $g_{s,i}$ is finitely supported.  Furthermore, it is clear that each $h_i$ sends intervals to finite unions of intervals (some of which might perhaps be degenerate); that is, it sends Borel sets to Borel sets. I am struggling, though, to show that f sends Borel sets to Borel (or at least Lebesgue Mesurable) sets, since the support for $g_s$ might be dense (say, the rationals), and so I am not sure what control might be had over the image set f(I) in this case, where I is an interval. Note:  I had asked a much broader question about the application of the Radon-Nykodym theorem to this situation a few weeks ago; I have since made peace with my approach to the problem, and only this specific technicality remains. Also note:  Since the image $h_i(I) = J_i$ is a union of (perhaps degenerate) intervals, and the procession to $h_{i+1}(I)=J_{i+1}$ at most splits 1 interval and shifts finitely many others, it seems ""intuitive"" that such a process could not cause the ""limit"" of the $J_i$'s to leave the Borels (at least give or take a Lebesgue Measure zero set).  But in attempting to remove the quotations (and the doubt!) by, say, looking at the limit of the indicator functions of these sets after giving the points of jump the natural (ascending) ordering, I am still not confident in the passage from the finite to the countably infinite. Proposed solution:  perhaps I've just been approaching this all wrong!?  Such an f admits a (perhaps nonstrictly) increasing inverse; this $f^{-1}$ is Borel (or at least Lebesgue) measurable, is it not (since the pullback of a ray of reals is a ray of reals)?!  In other words, $f(B) = (f^{-1})^{-1}(B)$ is Borel (or at least Lebesgue)!?

1765442,What do uniformly continuous functions look like?,"When I see a function, I want to be able to quickly determine whether it is uniformly continuous or not. Usually, this kind of skill comes after being exposed to many different examples that either do or do not have the desired feature, but the questions on this site about examples of functions that are continuous but not uniformly continuous all point to just one example ($f(x)=\frac 1 x$). What properties distinguish continuous functions from uniformly continuous functions? An immediate answer to my question is that Lipschitz-continuous functions are uniformly continuous. Visually, the gradient of a Lipschitz-continuous function will always be bounded. Using this property, $f(x)=\frac 1 x$ has an unbounded gradient function, which implies that $f$ is not a Lipschitz-continuous function. But there are some functions that are uniformly continuous but not Lipschitz-continuous, so this is does not test whether a function is not uniformly continuous, only if a function is uniformly continuous.","['uniform-continuity', 'functions']"

1765452,"Double obstructing wall problem, what is the optimal walk path and length?","Every day, you walk from point A to point B which are exactly $2$ miles apart straight line distance, however, each day, there is a $50$% chance of there being an obstructing wall perpendicular to the direct AB segment.  The wall cannot be seen so you wont know it is there until you actually bump it.  It is like an invisible force field that forces you to walk around it when you bump it and you will know immediately when you have cleared it , thus you can change your path once cleared.  The wall extends $1$ mile in both directions perpendicular to the direct AB path so if that wall is at the midpoint of AB, it would create a symmetrical + shape with the direct AB path.  Additionally, there is a 2nd obstructing wall that we have to deal with $25$% of the time (on average) but is only half of the length of the larger wall so it extends only $.5$ miles in both directions perpendicular to the direct AB path.  The $2$ walls can be present independently of each other. You can assume all ground is flat and that neither wall will ever be within the first or last half mile of the direct path line segment between A and B.  That is, the $2$ walls can only be in the middle mile between A and B if at all.  For any given walk, there could be $0$, $1$, or $2$ walls present.    Also, any walls will be uniformly distributed in the middle mile.  If the $2$ walls are at the same exact spot, you can just treat that as if only the large wall is present since the obstruction would be identical. What walk strategy will minimize the walk distance on average going from A to B?  That is, if you were to connect the dots of all the optimal (x,y) coordinates to be at during an average walk, what would the shape of the path look like (on a non-wall day)?

1765516,Deriving the curl of a vector field from the definition of torque.,"I just learned about the definition of $\text{curl}\ F$ for some vector field $F(x, y)=M(x, y)\mathbf{e}_1+N(x, y)\mathbf{e}_2$ in $\Bbb{R}^2$ and was wondering how that could be derived from the definition of torque: $$
\tau=F\times r
$$ My interpretation of curl is that it represents an infinitesimal rate of torque at a point, so my intuition was to set $r = \langle \text{d}x,\ \text{d}y \rangle$, since then $\tau$ would represent the torque infinitesimally close to a point $\langle x,\ y\rangle$. Now of course, for the cross product to make sense $F$ and $r$ have to be in $\Bbb{R}^3$, so we can just add on a third component of zero to both of them. Now we have
$$
F = \langle M(x, y),\ N(x, y),\ 0\rangle \\
r = \langle \text{d}x,\ \text{d}y,\ 0\rangle 
$$
Computing the cross product gives
$$
\tau = \langle 0,\ 0,\ M(x, y)\text{d}y-N(x, y)\text{d}x\rangle
$$
Then I assumed that since $\tau$ is a vector and curl is a scalar, we can obtain the curl from $\tau$ by computing it's magnitude, which gives:
$$
\text{curl}\ F = ||\tau|| = M(x, y)\text{d}y-N(x, y)\text{d}x
$$
Obviously that's wrong, but it seems very close (at least in my opinion) to the actual definition of curl:
$$
\text{curl}\ F = N_x-M_y
$$
My ""curl"" has $M\text{d}y$ instead of $M_y$ and $N\text{d}x$ instead of $N_x$, and is off by a factor of $-1$. Am I on the right track? I feel really close, but I just can't figure out where to go from here to get the right definition of curl. Is curl actually even equivalent to torque, or is it equivalent to something else?",['multivariable-calculus']
1765521,How many values does the expression $1 \pm 2 \pm 3 \pm \cdots \pm n$ take?,"How many different values does the expression $1 \pm 2 \pm 3 \pm \cdots \pm n$ take? I was wondering about this problem and didn't think it was immediately obvious. The answer can't be $2^{n-1}$ since the combinations all might not be unique. I was thinking of looking at partitions of $\{1,2,\ldots,n, k\}$ where $1 \pm 2 \pm 3 \pm \cdots \pm n = k$ and thus the sum must be even. Therefore, $\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}+k = \dfrac{n(n+1)+2k}{2}$ must be even which means $n(n+1) + 2k$ must be a multiple of $4$ so $n(n+1)+2k = 4m$.

Here is my attempt at a solution: Let $A_0$= sequences where there are two $0$'s that appear in the sequence. ... $A_{9}$=sequences where there are two $9$'s that appear in the sequence. I want the intersection of $A_0^{'}A_1^{'}...A_9^{'}$= $N-S_1+S_2$ because you can only have at most two digits who are used exactly two times each in a $5$ digit sequence. $N=10^5$, $S_1=10\cdot \binom{5}{2}\cdot[9+9\cdot 8 \cdot 7]$, and $S_2=10 \cdot 9 \cdot \binom{5}{4} \cdot8$.

1765833,Division of segments into infinitely many parts.,"Let AB and CD be two segments, so that the length of AB is 1, and the length of CD is 2. If we divide AB and CD in infinitely many parts, how ""long"" would those parts be? I'm particularly interested in their size, relative to each other. Intuitively, the length of these parts would approach 0, as we increase their number. But, if it became zero when we have infinitely many segments, then that would be a problem. Because then, by adding up infinitely many parts with length 0, I'd get a 0-length segment back. So, I'm guessing that the lengths of those parts are not really zero, but some value $\epsilon$, bigger than 0, but smaller than any other real number; the value that comes immediately after zero. Now that we have this value ϵ, then we could say that the segment AB is composed of infinitely many parts of size ϵ. But, what about CD? Would it be composed of twice as many parts of size ϵ? Would it still be split into infinitely many parts, but their size being 2ϵ? While I debated this with a friend, she said that ""some infinities are bigger than others"", and said that the second segment would be split in twice as many parts as AB, all of size ϵ. To which I replied that if we have infinitely many elements, doubling them doesn't matter, they still are infinitely many. You could argue that I haven't defined how I split these segments.

The proof to show a continuous function is measurable says: $\{x : f(x) > c \}$ is open, and hence Borel and hence Lebesgue measurable. Now, I am having troubles with this because I don't think I understand exactly what measurable means. We have a sigma algebra $\mathcal{F}$, and we say $f$ is measurable if $\{x : f(x) > c \} \in \mathcal{F}$ for every $ c \in \mathbb{R}$ - what does $\{x : f(x) > c \} \in \mathcal{F}$ mean exactly? In the example showing a continuous function is measurable, I understand that $\{x: f(x) > c\} = f^{-1}((c,\infty])$ and since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}((c,\infty])$ is open, so it is Borel - but how does this included that $f^{-1}((c,\infty])\in \mathcal{F}?$ surely this is only true if $\mathcal{F}$ is the Borel sigma algebra, but the question has not specified it was, and I am assuming $\mathcal{F}$ is a general $\sigma-$algebra.

Let us define sum of digits (in base 10) function $sd_{10}$ over the set of natural numbers in an obvious way as $sd_{10}(n)=\sum_{i=0}^ma_i$, where we have that $n=\sum_{i=0}^m a_i \cdot 10^i$. If we choose some number, for example $7$ ,then we can find prime number which has its sum of digits equal to $7$, for example $61$. If we choose some number divisible by $3$ as the sum of digits then we cannot find a prime number that has that sum of digits because it is known that the number is divisible by $3$ if and only if sum of its digits is divisible by $3$ . Let us also suppose here, because of the easier phrasing of the question, that the number $1$ is also prime so that if we choose that the sum of digits is $1$ we have a solution which equals $1$. Now I would like to share this question with you: Is it true that for every $n \in \mathbb N \setminus \{3k : k \in \mathbb N\}$ there exists at least one prime number $p$ which is such that we have $sd_{10}(p)=n$?","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
1766003,Measure on $\omega$ defined in the generic extension by an atomless measure algebra is atomless,"Work in Cantor space with standard probability measure $m$.

For a sequence of real numbers $a_n$, the ultralimit with respect to $U$ is defined as the unique $r$ such that $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists X\in U \forall n\in X |a_n-r|<\epsilon$. My question is whether it is possible to find two sequences $\langle B_n :n\in \omega\rangle, \langle C_n: n\in \omega\rangle$ such that $B_n, C_n \subset A_n$ and $D$ measurable such that 
$$\inf_{E\subset D} \mu_E(\bar{B}) >0, \inf_{E\subset D} \mu_E(\bar{C}) >0?$$ If no infemum is taken then it is easy, say fix $E$ measurable not null, we only need to go to a large set $X\in U$ such that $\forall n\in X m(E\cap A_n)>\frac{r}{2}m(E)$.

But I'm wondering if the converse is true? Namely, if $\phi:E\rightarrow{E}$ is an automorphism of $E/k$ such that $\phi^{*}\omega_{E}=\omega_{E}$, then $\phi$ should be a translation map? My only attempt is assuming that $\phi$ is of the form $(x,y)\mapsto{(u^{2}x+r,u^{3}y+u^{2}sx+t)}$ for some $u\in{k^{*}}$ and  $r,s,t\in{k}$ (I think we can assume this) and applying the definition directly $\phi^{*}\frac{dx}{2y+a_{1}+a_{3}}=\frac{d\phi^{*}x}{2\phi^{*}y+a_{1}\phi^{*}x+a_{3}}=\frac{d(u^{2}x+r)}{2(u^{3}y+u^{2}sx+t)+a_{1}(u^{2}x+r)+a_{3}}=\frac{u^{2}dx}{2u^{3}y+(2u^{2}s+a_{1}u^{2})x+(2t+a_{1}r+a_{3})}$ which by hypothesis is equal to $\omega_{E}$ again. This seems to suggest that $u=1$ and $s=0$, and also $2t+a_{1}r=0$. So $\phi$ is of the form $(x,y)\mapsto{(x+r,y+t)}$. Is it possible to conclude from this that $\phi$ is a translation map?

We assume the initial condition is nice enough, such that no subtleties arise and we can use the separation of variables. Question: How can the Bessel function of the second kind be in the radial eigenfunction? Context: When we use the separation of variables, the problem boils down to solving two ODEs in the angular and the radial part. In the radial part, when we consider the disk or the ball ($a=0$), we impose the condition $u(0)<+\infty$ at the origin ($u$ is the solution), which eliminates the Bessel function of the second kind from the consideration for the eigenfunction in the radial part. Suppose $a>0$. I have found, e.g., in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1278.pdf , in the radial part people consider both the Bessel function of the first and second. But if you see the plot of the second kind, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BesselFunctionoftheSecondKind.html , you see it is unbounded not only in the neighborhood of the origin but the ""unboundedness-point"" shifts rightward. How can one consider non-trivial eigenfunctions with Dirichlet boundary condition, but with possibly unbounded functions? Also, are there books that treats $d=3$ in detail?

  is a smooth curve of genus $1$. The author briefly talked about the concept genus in this section without assuming much knowledge in topology. One proposition said that the genus of smooth curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$ is $\binom{d-1}{2}$. Then in one exercise I showed that the arithmetic genus ($(-1)^{\dim X}\cdot (\chi_X(0)-1)$) of a smooth curve in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$ agrees with the geometric genus, where $\chi_X$ is the Hilbert polynomial of the projective variety $X$. The author then stated that this can be generalized to any smooth projective curve over $\mathbb{C}$. So I think I should use that formula for this exercise. The smoothness can be shown by the Segre embedding. Now the formula says that the genus is
$$1-\chi_X(0).$$
And $\chi_X(d)=\binom{3+d}{3}-\binom{3+d-4}{3}$. But I cannot get $1$. I must have made some mistake when calculating $\chi_X(d)$. But I couldn't figure out where. Thank you for any help!","['algebraic-curves', 'projective-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

but that just improves the previous approximation by a constant factor. The previous inequality has a nice side effect. From $\frac{x}{e^x-1}\approx\exp\left(-\frac{x}{2}-\frac{x^2}{24}\right)$ it follows that:
$$ \int_{0}^{+\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{12}\right)\frac{x}{e^x-1}\,dx \approx \int_{0}^{+\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{12}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{x}{2}-\frac{x^2}{24}\right)\,dx = -1,$$
or: $$ \frac{\zeta(2)}{2!}+\frac{\zeta(3)}{3!}\approx 1.$$","['approximation-theory', 'integration', 'riemann-zeta']"
1767410,"Given a first fundamental form, showing a particular second form cannot exist","If I have a first fundamental form $
\mathrm{d}u^2+\cos^2 u \mathrm{d}v^2$, I am trying to show that the second fundamental form cannot equal $f(u,v)\mathrm{d}v^2$ for a smooth function $f(u,v)$. I have calculated the Christoffel symbols and arrived at the following set of equations: $\sigma_{uu} = L \cdot \mathbf{N}$ $\sigma_{uv} = -\tan u \cdot \sigma_v + M \cdot \mathbf{N}$ $\sigma_{vv} = \tan u \cdot \sigma_u + N \cdot \mathbf{N}$ I suppose I was expecting to arrive at a contradiction, but I can't really see where any problem occurs with the fundamental form only having a coefficient for $N$ I know that both fundamental forms of a sphere are $\mathrm{d} u^2+ \cos^2 u \mathrm{d}v^2$ but does having such a first fundamental form necessarily imply that the surface is a sphere?","['curvature', 'differential-geometry', 'surfaces']"
1767411,Showing $A+B$ is invertible?,"Question number two of this released exam asks: Let $A$, $B$ be two $n \times n$ matrices with real elements such that $A^3 = B^5 = I_n$ and $AB = BA$. Prove that $A+B$ is invertible. I am not exactly sure what to do. I have observed that: $$A(A^2) = I_n$$
$$B(B^4) = I_n$$ So: $$A^{-1} = A^2$$
$$B^{-1} = B^4$$ My general approach to the problem has been to consider the binomial expansion of $(A+B)^n$ and see if things cancel out to be $I_n$ or some multiple of $I_n$, and with that construct an explicit inverse of $A+B$. For $n \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ nothing seems to reduce down to the identity, leading me to believe this is the wrong approach. Any hints as how to approach this problem would be greatly appreciated thanks.","['matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'linear-algebra']"
1767467,Why prefer the t-score when the sample size is low?,"According to this link : The general rule of thumb for when to use a t score is when your sample size meets the following two requirements: The sample size is below 30 The population standard deviation is unknown (estimated from your sample data) In other words, you must know the standard deviation of the population and your sample size must be above 30 in order for you to be able to use the z-score. Otherwise, use the t-score. Question: Suppose that our sample size is below 30 and that we do know our population standard deviation. Why not use the z-score? I understand that according to the central limit theorem, with $n < 30$ so low we would have no expectation that our sample estimator would be normal. Does this have something to do with why we should prefer the t-score in this case?",['statistics']
1767471,Prove that for $k>1$ $a_n$ is a perfect square,"I'm having problems with this exercise.
Let $k > 1$ be an integer. We define $(a_n)_{n \in \Bbb N_0}$ as:
$$a_0 = 1$$ $$a_1 = 1$$ $$a_{n+2} = (k^2-2)a_{n+1}-a_n-2(k-2)$$
Prove that $\forall n \in \Bbb N_0, a_n$ is a perfect square. I'm not sure how to tackle this problem. I want to prove that $a_n=(a+b)^2$ in some way. I was going to attempt with induction, $P(0)$ and $P(1)$ are true, $P(2)=(k-1)^2$... but how should I pick $P(n)$ and $P(n+1)$. Or should I try other method? I've also tried finding the roots so I could have the closed formula for the sequence but I've ended up with a rather disappointing looking expression: $\frac{(k^2-2) \pm \sqrt{k^4-4k^2-8k+16}}{2}$ Any ideas or suggestions?

1767490,Are there theoretical applications of trigonometry?,"I am a high school student currently taking pre-calculus. We have just finished a unit on analytic trigonometry. Are any purely theoretical uses for trigonometry? More specifically, can trigonometric concepts (or even functions) be used to prove/disprove general mathematical conjectures? I have been told it is used a lot in calculus, but by my (extremely) limited knowledge it mainly consists of applying calculus concepts to trigonometric functions. Is this correct?",['trigonometry']
