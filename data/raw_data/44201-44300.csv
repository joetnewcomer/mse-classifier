440236,"linearly independence of $e^{a_1x},... e^{a_nx}$","$a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are real different numbers. Prove that the functions $e^{a_1x},...,e^{a_nx}$ are linearly independent in $Fun(R,R)$. My way to try to prove it: 
I assumed: $b_1e^{a_1x} + \cdots + b_n e^{a_nx} = 0$, and we want to show that $b_1 = \cdots = b_n = 0$.
I differentiated it $n-1$ times, so I wrote it in $n\times n$ matrix. Then if I do transpose and calculate the determinant, I get something like: $b_1 \cdots b_n \times\text{Vandermonde Det}$. I know Vandermonde det isn't $0$, but if one of the $b_i$'s is zero everything is zero and the det is $0$ so it is singular and it is linearly dependent! so I don't know why it is true at all.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'functions', 'determinant']"

440327,Turning a Line Integral into a Contour one,"I'm trying to compute an integral appearing in the article ""On Determinants of Laplacians on Riemann Surfaces"" of D'Hoker and Phong (page 541). It is as following. Fix $B\in \mathbb{R}_+$ and let $\lambda \in (0,1) \setminus\{\text{annoying points}\}$, then we want to show: $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{B-i\sin(\theta) -\lambda\sqrt{B^2+1}}{B-i\sin(\theta) -2\lambda\sqrt{B^2+1} +\lambda^2(B+i\sin(\theta))} d\theta = \frac{\pi}{1-\lambda}.$$ Quoting from their article: This integral can e viewed as a contour integral around the unit circle of a meromorphic function with a single pole inside, whose residue can be computed explicitly. A straightforward calculation then yields the value $\pi(1-\lambda)^{-1}$. My theorical problem is that the integrand is not a $\pi$-periodic function. In specific its values at $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$ disagree. How can I turn it into a contour integral? There doesn't seem to be any obvious and nice ""completion"" of the function to be used as a contour integral either. Am I missing something obvious? My second approach has been to observe that the real part of the integrand is actually $\pi$-periodic, while the imaginary part is $\pi$-antiperiodic. Therefore I can just restrict to the real part and turn it into a contour integral (via the transformation $z:=e^{2i\theta}$). But this time the function has, besides $z=0$, another pole floating around in the unit circle, which make the computation quite messy. An ideal answer to this question should address both the general philosophy of how to turn a line integral into a contour one, and the specific case in examination. But partial answers are obviously most welcome! Thanks!

440434,Decisive equivalence of collections of probability measures,"Working on the optimal decision theory in stochastic setting, I've found out that the following notion of equivalence is very useful. Let $(X,\mathscr A)$ be a measurable space, and let $\mathrm b\mathscr A$ denote the space of all bounded measurable functions
$$
  f:(X,\mathscr A)\to(\Bbb R,\mathscr B(\Bbb R)).
$$
Let also $\mathcal P(X,\mathscr A)$ denote the collection of all probability measures on $(X,\mathscr A)$. Definition: we say that collections $P,Q\subseteq \mathcal P(X,\mathscr A)$ are equivalent, and we write $P\sim Q$ if 
  $$
  \sup_{p\in P}\int_\Omega f\;\mathrm dp = \sup_{q\in Q}\int_\Omega f\;\mathrm dq \qquad \forall f\in \mathrm b\mathscr A. \tag{1}
$$ The relation above is clearly an equivalence relation, and also it does not matter whether we put $\sup$ or $\inf$ in $(1)$. It is useful especially when one wants to show that $Q\subset P$ is a strict subset of $P$, but still $P\sim Q$. However, I am not sure whether that's the only notion of equivalence between the collections of measures, and perhaps $(1)$ already has a different name.","['stochastic-processes', 'game-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory', 'terminology']"

440466,Is this a measurable space?,"This probably has a very quick answer but it's been bugging me for a while. Take two copies of the Cartesian plane. On each plane cut out the square $S=(0,1)\times(0,1)$. Throw away the rest. Now make a cut in each square from the middle of the top edge $(1/2,1)$ to the center $(1/2,1/2)$. Identify the left edge of the cut on one square with the right edge of the cut on the other square, and vice versa. That's my space $X$. My question is: is this a ""measure space""? I.e. is the measure just inherited from my original Euclidean measure on the planes or can the cut get me into trouble? The context of my question is that I have an integral kernel $k(x,y)$ defined on $X\times X$ and I want to study the integral operator $K$ associated with it. In most of the literature I could find on integral operators, $X$ is assumed to be either a subset of the Euclidean space (say the Wikipedia article or Stone's book) or, more generally, a measure space. I want to use the theorems on integral operators (in particular the fact that when $K$ is Hilbert-Schmidt, then the $L^2(X\times X)$-norm of $k(x,y)$ is equal to the sum of the squared eigenvalues of $K$). So I just want to make sure that my $X$ satisfies the necessary conditions for those theorems.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
440475,Definition of the higher dimensional mapping tori,"This is proving harder to search for than I imagined. The usual definition of a mapping torus $\mathcal{M}_h$ associated to a homeomorphism $h\colon X\rightarrow X$ on a topological space $X$ is the quotient of the product $X\times I$ by the equivalence relation given by $(x,1)\sim_h (h(x),0)$ . So $$\mathcal{M_h}=(X\times I)/\sim_h$$ As $h$ is invertible and can be iterated, this space acts as a model to study the dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}$ action on $X$ given by $h$ . I've recently found it necessary to study a higher analogue of this construction defined by a $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$ action of homeomorphisms on a space $X$ . More precisely, I would like the higher dimensional mapping torus $\mathcal{M}_G$ to fiber over the $d$ -dimensional torus with fiber $X$ and such that an $\mathbb{R}^d$ action on $\mathcal{M}_G$ is inherited such that the subaction by the subgroup $\mathbb{Z}^d$ fixes fibers set-wise and acts as $G$ on individual fibers. That is, $\mathcal{M}_G$ should model the dynamics of the action of $G$ on $X$ . However, the exact formulation of this construction is not entirely obvious to me. My attempt at giving a definition is as follows. Let $G\cong \mathbb{Z}^d$ act on the space $X$ by homeomorphisms and let $\mathbb{Z}^d$ be generated by the $d$ homeomorphisms $h_i\colon X\rightarrow X$ , with $1\leq i\leq d$ . We form the mapping torus $\mathcal{M}_G$ associated to the action of $G$ on $X$ by taking the quotient of the product $X \times [0,1]^d$ by the equivalence relation generated by $\sim_G$ where, for all $x\in X$ , $(x, s_1, \ldots, s_d) \sim_G (h_i(x), t_1, \ldots, t_d)$ if for some $1\leq i\leq d$ $s_i=1$ , $t_i=0$ and $s_j=t_j$ for all $j\neq i$ . That is, $$\mathcal{M}_G=(X\times [0,1]^d)/\sim_G.$$ Is this the usual construction, or is there a simpler formulation? Or does the above not even coincide with the usual definition? (I'm thinking that maybe there is a nicer way of forming this space as a covering by the space $X\times\mathbb{R}^d$ ). I would also very much appreciate if someone could suggest places in the literature where this construction is described and used.","['general-topology', 'dynamical-systems', 'reference-request', 'definition']"
440506,Two notions of finer/coarser in Topology,"As I learned in the beginning of Topology, if I have two topologies $\tau_1, \tau_2$ on a space $X$ such that
$$
 \tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2
$$
then $\tau_2$ is called finer then $\tau_1$ and $\tau_1$ is called coarser then $\tau_2$. Roughly speaking ""finer"" means has more elements, and ""coarser"" means has less elements (which makes intuitively sense cause the notion of ""closeness of points"" axiomatizied by a topology is finer). Now I read about open covers and refinements. The definitions are here . Now a cover is finer if it actually contains less open sets, and coarser if it contains more, am I right? So here the meaning of finer is totatlly different? (maybe intuitively finer means for a point it could be more accurately said in which open set it falls, and if there are more the more ""fuzzy"" the ""location"" of the point is). Am I right, and maybe is there some connections between these two notions of finer/coarser?","['general-topology', 'analysis']"

440593,Union notation in Hall's theorem,"This is taken from a proof for Hall's theorem based on ideas of R. Rado. I am having trouble with some union notation in the proof. (Substantial parts of the proof is missing here as I am only concerned with the problems I am having with the union notation.) Initially we had the sets $A_1, ..., A_n$. Then they were stripped so much that it is no longer possible to remove elements from them without violating the Hall condition : for all $k ≤ n$, the union of any $k$ of the sets $A_i$ contains at least $k$ elements . Now we have the sets $B_1, ..., B_n$, with $B_i \subseteq A_i$ for each $i$. It is not longer possible to remove any further element from any $B_i$ without violating the Hall condition. The following is according to the author when proving that each $B_i$ is a singleton set. Suppose $B_1$ has two elements x, y. Removing any element will violate the Hall condition. So there are two sets P, Q of indices such that if $X = (B_1 - \{x\}) \cup \bigcup_{i \in P}B_i$ and $Y = (B_1 - \{y\}) \cup \bigcup_{i \in Q}B_i$ then $|X| \leq |P|$ and $|Y| \leq |Q|$. But $X \cup Y = B_1 \cup \bigcup_{i \in P \cap Q}B_i$ and $X \cap Y \supseteq \bigcup_{i \in P \cap Q}B_i$. It is this last part I am having trouble with. I would believe the following to be true: $X \cup Y = B_1 \cup \bigcup_{i \in P}B_i \cup \bigcup_{i \in Q}B_i = B_1 \cup \bigcup_{i \in P \cup Q}B_i$ whereas the author has $i \in P \cap Q$ as index in the big union. Furthermore I would have the following: $X \cap Y = \bigcup_{i \in P}B_i \cap \bigcup_{i \in Q}B_i = \bigcup_{i \in P \cap Q}B_i$. This is probably an easy case for most people here at StackExchange.

440635,locally finite open cover and $\sigma$-discreteness,"The Definitions : A family $\{ A_s \}_{s \in S}$ of subsets of a topological space $X$ is locally finite if for every point $x \in X$ there exists a neighbourhood $U$ such that the set $\{ s \in S \mid U \cap A_s \ne \emptyset \}$ is finite. If every point $x \in X$ has a neighbourhood that intersects at most one set of a given family, than we say that the family is discrete . Clearly any discrete family, as well as any finite family, is locally finite. A family of subsets of a topological space is called $\sigma$-locally finite ($\sigma$-discrete) if it can be represented as a countable union of locally finite (discrete) families. Now I want to show that a locally finite open cover of a metrizable space is not necessarily $\sigma$-discrete. For this I consider the discrete topology on $\mathbb R$, now
$$
  \mathbb R \subseteq \bigcup_{X \subseteq \mathbb R} X
$$
is an open cover, this cover is just the set $2^{\mathbb R}$. Now because $\{ x \}$ is open in the discrete topology and $|\{x\} \cap U| \le 1$ for every $U\subseteq \mathbb R$, this cover is locally finite. I guess it is not $\sigma$-discrete, cause if

 2^{\mathbb R} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} L_i

440647,differentiation under the integral sign,"Let $f \in L^1(R)$. Consider the function:
$$
F(x) = \int_R e^{ixt}f(t) dt

For the first part, it's easy to show that the first derivative of $F$ exist. Basically, we only need to show the following equality:
$$
\lim_{|h|\rightarrow 0} \int_{R} \frac{e^{i(x+h)t} - e^{ixt}}{h} f(t)dt = \int_{R}\lim_{|h|\rightarrow 0} \frac{e^{i(x+h)t} - e^{ixt}}{h} f(t)dt
$$
Since $f \in L^1$, the above can be achieved by the Dominated Convergence Theorem. 
Similarly, to show $F$ is twice differentiable, we need to establish the following:
$$
\lim_{|h|\rightarrow 0} \int_{R} \frac{e^{i(x+h)t} - e^{ixt}}{h} itf(t)dt = \int_{R}\lim_{|h|\rightarrow 0} \frac{e^{i(x+h)t} - e^{ixt}}{h} itf(t)dt

I recognize there must be an epimorphism $\phi : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2} * \mathbb{Z}_{3}$ (the free product) by the Van Dyck theorem, but I must show an isomorphism. Essentially, I believe we can do $\psi : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2} * \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, $\psi(a^{p_{1}} b^{q_{1}} ... a^{p_{n}} b^{q_{n}}) = (1_{2})^{p_{1}} (1_{3})^{q_{1}} ...

Exercise 6, chapter 4 Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"" Suppose E is compact, and prove that f is continuous on E if and only if its graph is compact. So, if I suppose that $f|X\rightarrow Y$, then the graph of $f$ is $G_f=\{x,f(x)|x\in X\}$. This in turn is a subset of $X\times Y$- no problem. However, in order to reason on whether $G_f$ is compact, don't I need to assume some topology on $X\times Y$? Don't I necessarily sacrifice generality by making such an assumption? So first, am I correct in thinking that assuming a topology on $X\times Y$ constitutes a loss of generality, and second, is there a way to approach this problem without making such an assumption (i.e., using the case of a general topology, rather than a specific one such as the product topology).","['general-topology', 'continuity', 'compactness', 'real-analysis']"

Let $n_3$ and $n_7$ denote the number of sylow subgroups for 3 and 7, respectively. $n_7 \equiv 1 \mod 7$ and $n_7 | 3 \implies n_7 = 1$ $n_3 \equiv 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3 | 7 \implies n_3 = 1, 7$ Let $P_3 \cong \Bbb{Z}_3 $ and $P_7 \cong \Bbb{Z}_7$ . Since $P_7$ is always normal in G, we know that $G \cong \Bbb{Z}_7 \rtimes_{\alpha} \Bbb{Z}_3$ . Case 1: Let $n_3 = 1$ . Then we know that $P_3$ is also normal, and so $G \cong \Bbb{Z}_7 \times \Bbb{Z}_3$ . Case 2: Let $n_3=7$ . We have $\alpha : \Bbb{Z}_3 \rightarrow \Bbb{Z}_7^{\times} \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ So the generator $a$ of $\Bbb{Z}_3$ needs to be sent to an element of order 3 in $\Bbb{Z}_6$ , which means that it needs to be sent to either $2$ or $4$ . Let $\alpha'(a) = 2$ and $\alpha(a)=4$ . There are two theorems from J.S. Milne's notes that says: Theorem 1 If there exists an $\alpha \in Aut(N)$ such that $$\theta'(q) = \alpha \circ \theta(q) \circ \alpha^{-1} \forall q \in Q$$ then the map $$(n,q) \rightarrow (\alpha(n), q): N \rtimes_{\theta} Q \rightarrow N \rtimes_{\theta'} Q$$ is an isomorphism. Theorem 2 If $\theta = \theta' \circ \alpha$ with $\alpha \in Aut(Q)$ , then the map $$(n,q) \rightarrow (n, \alpha(q)) : N \rtimes_{\theta} Q \approx N \rtimes_{\theta'} Q$$ We know that there are two automorphisms of $\Bbb{Z}_3$ , the identity and $f: n \rightarrow 2n$ . Since $\alpha(a) = \alpha' \circ f (a)$ , we know that $\Bbb{Z}_7 \rtimes_{\alpha} \Bbb{Z}_3 \cong \Bbb{Z}_7 \rtimes_{\alpha'} \Bbb{Z}_3$ . So I was able to show that they are isomorphic by using theorem 2. But I was wondering if I could use theorem 1 instead. Here is the problem that I ran into when I attempted to use the first one: We know that $Aut(\Bbb{Z}_7) \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ , and it's easier to see which elements have order three in $\Bbb{Z}_6$ than in $Aut(\Bbb{Z}_7)$ . But after finding the elements 2 and 4, how can I use theorem 1?

Then the Jordan normal form of $A$ is given by $$J := \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Then there exist a matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP = J$. I am having an issue finding $P$. From the theory of Jordan normal forms, $P = [w_{1}\, w_{2}\, w_{3}]$ where $w_{1}, w_{2}$ is the basis of the nullspace of $(A - 0\cdot I)^{2}$ (where $I$ is the identity matrix) and $w_{3}$ is the basis of the nullspace of $(A - 4\cdot I)$. We first consider $(A - 0 \cdot I)^{2}$. As $$A^{2} = \begin{pmatrix} 9 & 3 & 18\\ 3 & 1 & 6\\ 3& 1 & 6\end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/3 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ (where the $\sim$ denotes row equivalence), the nullspace of $A^{2}$ is spanned the column vectors $\{(-2, 0, 1)^{t}, (-1, 3, 0)^{t}\}$. Next we consider $(A - 4 \cdot I)$. We have $$A - 4I = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 & 5\\ 0 & -3 & 3\\ 1 & 0 & -3 \end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -3\\0 & 1 & -1\\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}.$$ Then the nullspace is spanned by the column vector $(3, 1, 1)^{t}$. Therefore we should have $$P = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & -1 & 3\\0 & 3 & 1\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ However, when I compute $P^{-1}AP$, I get $$P^{-1}AP = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 4\end{pmatrix} \neq J.$$ Where did I go wrong?

I've asked this question before over here , and the answer was that $\infty-\infty$ is not well defined. I also found out here that you cannot raise both sides of a limit to a power unless the limit is strictly less than $1$ . However, there are also many examples where limits are treated as equations. For example, taking the logarithm of each side is standard procedure. Substitutions such as using $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {\sin x}{x}=1$ work (although other substitutions sometimes don't work). So when can a limit be treated as an equation? Can you take for example the sine or tangent of each side like you can take the log? My guess is that you can treat it as an equation $at$ $least$ whenever $nothing$ is approaching $0$ or $\infty$ , but I'm not sure. Thanks. P.S.

441031,Reduced schemes and global sections,"I am doing exercise  2.2.3(b) in Hartshorne which asks to show that for any scheme $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$, we have that $(X,({\mathcal{O}_X})_{red}^+)$ is a reduced scheme. By $({\mathcal{O}_X})_{red}$ I mean the the presheaf $U \mapsto \mathcal{O}_X(U)/\operatorname{nilrad}\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ and the superscript + denotes sheafification. Now to do this it is enough to show for any open affine cover $U_i$ of $X$ for which $(U_i,\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i})$ is isomorphic to an affine scheme, that we also have $(U_i,({\mathcal{O}_X})_{red}^+|_{U_i})$ isomorphic to an affine scheme. Now we have homeomorphisms $\varphi_i : \operatorname{Spec}(A_i) \to U_i$ and isomorphisms of sheaves $\varphi_i^\sharp :  (\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i}) \to (\varphi_i)_\ast \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}$ for some rings $A_i$ since $X$ is a scheme. It follows for every $i$, $\varphi^\sharp_i$ descends to an isomorphism of presheaves $\psi_i : (\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}|_{U_i} \to (\varphi_i)_\ast {\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}}_{red}.$
 Now suppose I know that ${\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}}_{red}$ is a sheaf on $A_i$. Then its pushforward under ${\varphi_i}_\ast$ is also a sheaf and so $(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}|_{U_i} $ is a sheaf. Then because sheafification is local it follows
$$(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}|_{U_i} \cong (\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}|_{U_i}^+ \cong (\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}^+|_{U_i}$$
is a sheaf too. My question is: I have shown that $(U_i,(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}^+) \cong (\operatorname{Spec}(A_i),{\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}}_{red})$. But I can't make sense of the right hand side: When I compute global sections I get
    $$\Gamma(\operatorname{Spec} A_i,{\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}}_{red}) \cong A_i/\operatorname{nilrad} A_i$$
    and not $A_i$, which is contrast to Proposition 2.2.2 (c) of Hartshorne. What am I misunderstanding about the proposition? It seems my result on global sections is correct because I want everything reduced. Also, is my approach above correct in general for such problems? Edit: It seems the proposition does not apply because on the L.H.S. above I either have to change my sheaf or my ring. Does this mean that in order to complete the problem I need $$(U_i,(\mathcal{O}_X)_{red}^+) \cong (\operatorname{Spec}(A_i/\operatorname{nilrad}A_i),{\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}(A_i)}}_{red})$$ and not as what I originally had above?

The book states a lemma that I'm a bit confused about: A sequence of operators $T_n\in L(X, Y)$ (here, $X$ and $Y$ are Banach Spaces) converges strongly to an operator $T\in L(X,Y)$ if and only if (i) the sequence $\{T_n x\}$ converges for any $x$ in a dense subset $M\subset X$; (ii) there exists $C>0$ such that $\| T_n\|\leq C$. My question is whether or not $M$ has to be a linear subspace. I think it does. The reason I think so is that the proof of the theorem says that we first define an operator $T_0$ by $$ T_0 x:= \lim_{n\to \infty} T_n x. $$ By the assumption that $T_n x$ converges on $M$, we have that the domain of an operator is $M$. Hence, $M$ must be a linear space. The proof then goes on to define an extension of $T_0$ by $$ Ty:= \lim_{n\to \infty} T_0 x_n, $$ where $x_n\to y$. Here we are using the density of $M$ and the boundedness of $T_0$ which is inherited from $\{T_n\}$. Even here though, to prove uniqueness of this limit under any sequence converging to $y$ we need the fact that $M$ is a subspace. The reason is that, if $\{z_n\}$ is any other sequence in $M$ converging to $y$, we have to consider the expression $$ \|T_0 x_n -T_0 z_n\|=\|T_0(x_n-z_n)\|\leq \|T_0\|\cdot \|x_n-z_n\|\to 0$$ since $\{x_n\}$ and $\{z_n\}$ both converge to $y$. We must have that the vector $x_n-z_n$ is in the domain of $T_0$ (i.e. $M$). Anyways, I'm pretty sure that our dense subset $M$ must be a dense subspace for this to work. Can someone please tell me if this is correct. I'm 98% sure this is a typo in the statement of the lemma.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

441094,Matrix Representation of Wreath Product,"My aim is to understand the wreath product of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $S_3$ in terms of group of matrices.

On this direct product, $S_3$ acts as a regular permutation group of degree $6$. The resulting group $\mathbb{Z}/2\wr S_3$ has order $2^6.|S_3|=2^7.3$. (2) There is a mathoverflow question with similar title. In the answer to this question, G. Robinson understood the  wreath product of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $S_3$ as: consider elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $3$, and let $S_3$ act on it by permutation group of degree $3$. The resulting semidirect product of $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^3$ by $S_3$ is the wreath product $\mathbb{Z}/2 \wr S_3$ (order of this group is $2^3.6=48$). The wreath product considered by G.

441136,"If a divisor $D$ on a surface has positive self-intersection, then $nD$ or $-nD$ has nontrivial sections, eventually in $n$.","Let $S$ be a smooth complex projective surface. Let $D$ be a divisor on $S$, such that $D^2 = D.D> 0$.  Then, at least one of the following holds: For $ n \gg 0$, $H^0(nD) \neq 0$; for $n \gg 0$, $H^0(-nD) \neq 0$. Here $H^0(D)$ denotes the space of holomorphic sections of the line bundle $[D]$ associated to $D$. With the notation ""n≫0"" I mean: ""for every n save for a finite number of them"". How do I prove this? I was given a proof in a course on algebraic surfaces, which makes use of Riemann-Roch theorem, but I'm afraid it's flawed... EDIT: actually, with the same hypothesis as above I can prove that $H^0(nD)$ or $H^0(-nD)$ is unbounded as a sequence indexed by $n$. I don't know whether the above statement is true. EDIT 2: The proof I have is as follows. Apply Riemann-Roch to $nD$ and $-nD$: $$h^0(nD) + h^2(nD) \geq \chi(\mathcal O_S) + \frac{1}{2}((n^2 D^2 - nD.K_S),$$
$$h^0(-nD) + h^2(-nD) \geq \chi(\mathcal O_S) + \frac{1}{2}((n^2 D^2 + nD.K_S).$$
Then, in both cases $\mathrm{LHS}$ goes to infinity as $n \to +\infty$. Now, suppose that $H^0(nD) = 0$ for infinite $n \in \mathbb N$ (that is, the negation of ""For $ n \gg 0$, $H^0(nD) \neq 0$""). Now, I would like to go on as follows: $h^2(nD) = h^0(K_S - nD) \neq 0$ for all $n \gg 0$ ( but this is not assured, I think! ), then for $n \gg 0$ there is $s_n \in H^0(K_S - nD)$, $s_n \neq 0$, and multiplication by $s_n$ induces an injective map
$$H^0(K_S + nD) \longrightarrow H^0(K_S + nD + K_S - nD) = H^0(2K_S),$$
so that $h^0(K_S + nD) = h^2(-nD)$ is a bounded sequence, and then $h^0(-nD) \to +\infty$, in particular $h^0(-nD) > 0$ for all $n \gg 0$.",['algebraic-geometry']

Then I used the dimension formula that states that $$\dim(U+V) = \dim(U) + \dim(V) - \dim(U \cap V)$$ so that I get $$r(A+B) \leq r(A) +r(B) - \dim(R(A)\cap R(B))$$ The last part would be to show that $$\dim(R(A)\cap R(B)) = \dim(R(AB))$$ using the fact that $AB=BA$. I need help with this last part. Also please critique me if the above solution is acceptable or if there is something wrong with it.

441356,Limiting value of $\lim \frac{1}{k}\sum_{n=1}^k \frac{p(n+1)-p(n)}{\log p(n)}$,"Empirically it seems $$\lim_{k\to \infty} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{n=1}^k \frac{g(n)}{\log p(n)} = 1\tag{1} $$ in which p(n) is the nth prime and g(n) is the prime gap $p(n+1)-p(n).$ Cramer conjectured that $$g(n) = O\left(\log^2 p(n)\right). $$ My somewhat open-ended question is: Formally how does (1) relate to Cramer's estimate (if at all)...and can we prove (1)? For instance, we might have infinitely many values $\frac{g(n)}{\log p(n)}$ close to $0$ for prime gaps of $2$. So clearly $(1) \nrightarrow g(n) \sim \log p(n).$ But can we say for general $f(n), g(n)$ for example that $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k}\sum \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 1 \rightarrow f(n) = O(g(n))? $$ I would prefer the question be construed broadly in case I have missed something about how these two ideas relate.

I have tried several substitutions and played around a lot in Mathematica, and can't seem to solve this. Perhaps an integral representation of $K_{0}(z)$ would be helpful here.

441395,Why does $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{(-1)^n \cdot n^2 + 1} = 1$?,"As the title suggests, I want to know as to why the following function converges to 1 for $n \to \infty$: $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{(-1)^n \cdot n^2 + 1} = 1
$$ For even $n$'s only $n^2+1$ has to be shown, which I did in the following way: $$\sqrt[n]{n^2} \le \sqrt[n]{n^2 + 1} \le \sqrt[n]{n^3}$$ Assuming we have already proven that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\sqrt[n]{n^k} = 1$ we can conclude that $$1 \le \sqrt[n]{n^2+1} \le 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{n^2+1} = 1.$$ For odd $n$'s I can't find the solution. I tried going the same route as for even $n$'s: $$\sqrt[n]{-n^2} \le \sqrt[n]{-n^2 + 1} \le \sqrt[n]{-n^3}$$ And it seems that it comes down to $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{-n^k}$$ I checked the limit using both Wolfram Alpha and a CAS and it converges to 1.

so the $n$th derivative is:
$$f^{(n)}(x)=2\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{k!}{(k-n)!(2k)!}x^{k-n}$$

441422,Gaussian Curve Fitting - Parameter Estimation,"I was redirected here because someone in SO pointed out this is more of a math question than a programming question: I have to fit a Gaussian curve to a noisy set of data and then take it's FWHM for a certain application. I used MATLAB to demo the concept, and curve fitting in MATLAB is extremely easy. However, I eventually have to translate the code into Java/Android. I tried looking for libraries in Android that would help me fit a Gaussian curve to data set, but I couldn't find anything. Consequently, I started trying to learn all the math involved so I could do it manually. My question: How do I go about estimating the three parameters (center, width, height) for a single-term gaussian model? I tried looking into the Expectation-Maximization algorithm but that went way over my head. In general, I assume it would have something to do with error minimization? I'm just having trouble figuring out the step-by-step method of fitting a gaussian curve to my data. Thanks for the help! Alec EDIT: One of the things I tried already involved taking the natural log of my data, fitting a parabola to the result using LSQR, and then transforming back. However, the results I'm getting aren't accurate, probably because this method is biased in some way or another. If you don't know how to do parameter estimation, do you have any other suggestions of fitting a curve to my data? (Remember, it has to be manual since Android seems to be fairly limited on it's statistics libraries)","['statistics', 'estimation']"

There graphs look different, so I am guessing not. Still I feel like I solved this problem, but I'd like to know how Apostol got his answer in the form he presented.
