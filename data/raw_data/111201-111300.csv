In both cases, depending on context, we speak about $G$-modules , this is also mentioned on the linked wikipedia-article. By $G$-module I mean here that only (1), (2) and (3) hold. Do you know any example where these notions are indeed different, i.e. an example where (1), (2) and (3) holds, but (4) fails? I tried to deduce (4) somehow from the other, my approach: Let $M$ and $G$ be given such that only (1), (2) and (3) is true. Then we can extend this to an action of the group ring $\mathbb F[G]$ (the set of formal sums, or functions $G \to \mathbb F$) by defining
$$
 v \cdot \left( \sum_{a_g} a_g g \right) := \sum_{g\in G} a_g (vg)
$$
for $v \in M$. Here we have just used the action of $G$ on $M$ and that $V$ is a $\mathbb F$-vector space. Then we could embed $\mathbb F \cdot 1_G \subseteq \mathbb F[G]$ and by (1) the induced action of $\mathbb F$ in $\mathbb F[G]$ and the one already given coincide, as $\lambda v = v\lambda$ and
\begin{align*}
 \lambda v & = \lambda (v \cdot 1_G) & \mbox{by (1)} \\
           & = v \cdot (\lambda \cdot 1_G) & \mbox{Definition of extended action.} \\
\end{align*}
And taking this further (just a thought, the computations are actually wrong)
\begin{align*}
 (\lambda v) g & = (v(\lambda \cdot 1_G)) g & \mbox{by the above} \\
               & = v( (\lambda \cdot 1_G)g ) & \mbox{by (2)} \\
               & = v ( \lambda g ) & \mbox{computation in $\mathbb F[G]$}.
\end{align*}
Okay, the step in the second line was a little bit cheating, as (2) just holds for group elements, and not elements from $\mathbb F[G]$ as applied here.

1603621,Minimal distance for Irrational Rotations on the circle,"It is a well known fact that for $\alpha$ irrational that $\langle n\alpha\rangle$ is dense on the unit circle.  I want to know what the result is for computing $a_n=\min_{1\le N \le n} |\langle N \alpha\rangle|$. Update Answer Due to Guest: The precise decay of $a_N$ depends heavily on the Diophantine properties of $\alpha$, and in particular on its continued fraction expansion.  In general $a_N<\frac{1}{N}$, as Michael Hardy notes; we can write this as $\limsup(Na_N)<1$.  This is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle and known as Dirichlet's theorem in Diophantine approximation. For algebraic irrational $\alpha$, Roth's theorem tells us that for every $\epsilon>0$ and any $N>N(\epsilon,\alpha)$, $$a_N > C_\epsilon N^{-1-\epsilon}.$$ Numbers for which $\liminf(Na_N)>0$ are called badly approximable.  A lot is known about these numbers, but many questions about them remain open as well.  They are uncountable in number.  Numbers which are not badly approximable, i.e. which decay faster than $1/N$ at infinitely many scales, are also uncountable and form a full measure set in $\mathbb{R}$. Then there are numbers for which $a_N$ not only decays much faster than $1/N$, but the decay can even be exponential for infinitely many $N$.  By Roth's theorem, all these numbers are transcendental.  It is instructive to try and construct such a number; the answer can be found on Mathoverflow with a little googling. For more information about these things consult any book on Diophantine Approximation; good sources are W.M.

Updated question (after Eric Wofsey's example): Is there an example of some $X$ and $Y$ non-affine $k$-schemes, with $X \times_{\operatorname{Spec k}} Y$ affine? My long and rambling thoughts about this question: I can think of examples where we allow more general fiber products: we can intersect non-affine subschemes of projective space to get an affine scheme (for example take some affine plane without the origin embedded in $\mathbb{P}^2$ and intersect it with a projective line that doesn't meet that origin). So I mean in particular the product over $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ (or $\operatorname{Spec} k$ for varieties). I also know of a near example where the product is allowed to be ""twisted"" as in a fibration / locally a product, though in this case the fibers are affine, namely: $GL_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{CP}^1$. (Here the map is the one induced by the natural action. The fibers are the invertible upper triangular matrices, etc.) (This example really can't be refined to an answer to my original question, for the reasons of the next paragraph.) Another vague conclusion: Suppose that there is some map $X \to X \times_{\mathbb{Z}} Y$ which induced by the identity on $X$ and some map $X \to Y$ (lets say we are working with $k$-schemes and $Y$ has a $k$ point... or some other condition to guarantee that this map actually exists) which is a closed embedding  - for example when $Y$ is separated (I think $Y$ has to be separated for this to be a closed embedding, but maybe I'm overthinking it: if $Y$ is separated, then $X \times_{\mathbb{Z}} Y \to X$ is separated, and $X \to X \times Y \to X$ is just the identity, so it is a closed embedding and so the Cancellation Theorem - 10.1.19 in Ravi - applies). Then if the product is affine it must necessarily be the case that $X$ (and $Y$) have ""a lot"" of functions on them (relative to ""the size"" of $X$ and $Y$ - I'm drawing on the intuition that the only global sections on projective varieties are $k$). So they can't be, for example, projective varieties. From this I want to say that an example (if it is exists) is likely to involve silly things like $\mathbb{A}^2$ (or I think more generally some $dim \geq 2$ Noetherian normal affine scheme minus some nonempty codimension $\geq 2$ set?). Or maybe part of the issue here is that my repertoire of non-affine schemes is limited to basically just quasi-projective varieties (and amusing pathologies built out of $\operatorname{Spec} k[x_0, x_1, \ldots]$) Those are the thoughts I've had. I don't know a good way to measure non-affineness in general... Except that the higher cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves should vanish.... but this is not something I really ""know"" yet, so I feel uncomfortable invoking it for now.

  Show whether those sets are bounded and/or precompact as subsets of $L^1((0,1))$.

For $E_3$ just estimate $\sin(x) \leq 1$ and you see that $E_3$ is also bounded. Now how to show precompactness? I need to show that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a finite covering of $E_1,E_2,E_3$ using $\varepsilon$-balls (or not). In my opinion we need to somehow select a finite family of functions from $E_i$, say $f^i_1,\dots,f^i_k$ s.t. all $f^i\in E_i$ belong to some ball $$B(f_j^i,\varepsilon) =  \{g\in E_i:\, \|f_j^i - g\|_{L^1} < \varepsilon\}$$ I don't understand how to choose such a set.

1604210,When is the image of a proper map closed?,"A map is called proper if the pre-image of a compact set is again compact. In the Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Bott and Tu, they remark that the image of a proper map $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb R^m$ is closed, adding the comment ""(why?)"". I can think of a simple proof in this case for continuous $f$ : If the image is not closed, there is a point $p$ that does not belong to it and a sequence $p_n \in f(\mathbb R^n)$ with $p_n \to p$ . Since $f$ is proper $f^{-1}(\overline {B_\delta(p)})$ is compact for any $\delta$ . Let $x_n$ be any point in $f^{-1}(p_n)$ and wlog $x_n \in f^{-1}(\overline{B_\delta(p)})$ . Since in $\mathbb{R}^n$ compact and sequentially compact are equivalent, there exists a convergent subsequence $x_{n_k}$ of $x_n$ . From continuity of $f$ : $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x)$ for some $x$ . But $f(x_{n_k})=p_{n_k} \to p$ which is not supposed to be in the image and this gives a contradiction. My problem is that this proof is too specific to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and uses arguments from basic analysis rather than general topology.

$$\mathbb{P}^{X_0}[X_{\tau + t} \in \cdot|\mathcal{F}_\tau]=\mathbb{P}^{X_\tau}[X_t \in \cdot].$$
Now, let us in addition to $\tau$ have another stopping time $\sigma$ which we define as $$\sigma:=\inf\{s > \tau;\, X_s \in A\}$$ for some subset $A$ of the state space. Now, intuitively
$$\mathbb{P}^{X_0}[X_{\sigma} \in \cdot|\mathcal{F}_\tau]=\mathbb{P}^{X_\tau}[X_{\sigma'} \in \cdot],$$

It is clear that $\sigma$ is ""sort of like"" $\tau+\sigma'$ but the problem is that unlike the case when I have $\tau+t$,i.e. a stopping time and a constant, the $\sigma'$ depends on $X$. I feel like I am missing something fairly easy here. Thanks for any hints.

So, I chose the interval $[\arcsin(-\frac{1}{3}),\frac{\pi}{2}]$ to calculate the area which can then be multiplied by $2$ for the other half. The problem is that the answer in the book seems to use $\arcsin(\frac{1}{3})$ instead, note the change of sign. Just to make sure I'm not misunderstanding where I went wrong, I get the answer $$
\frac{11 \pi}{4} - \frac{11}{2} \arcsin(-\frac{1}{3}) + 3 \sqrt 2
$$ Whereas the book gets $$
\frac{11 \pi}{4} - \frac{11}{2} \arcsin(\frac{1}{3}) - 3 \sqrt 2
$$ It's a subtle change of sign but I'd really like to understand where I went wrong.","['polar-coordinates', 'calculus']"

1604718,Rational series representation of $e^\pi$,"This question is related to Why $e^{\pi}-\pi \approx 20$, and $e^{2\pi}-24 \approx 2^9$? by Tito Piezas III. Andrew Fraker (2014) found an almost-integer which is equivalent to the following approximation
$$e^\pi\approx\frac{5^4}{3^3}$$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_coincidence#Containing_both_.CF.80_and_e However, $e^\pi<\frac{5^4}{3^3}$, so it cannot be obtained by truncating of the following series of rational terms, because the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing. $$
e^\pi=e^{6asin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{3\left(e^{3\pi}-\left(-1\right)^ke^{-3\pi}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}+3i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}-3i\right)}{2 \pi k!}
$$ This formula is built from the integer sequence http://oeis.org/A166748 with contributions by Povolotsky, Hasler, Mathar and Kotesovec. A similar series with slower convergence is obtained from Kotesovec closed form for http://oeis.org/A166741 $$
e^\pi=e^{2asin\left(1\right)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2^{k-1}\left(e^{\pi}-\left(-1\right)^ke^{-\pi}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}+i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}-i\right)}{\pi k!}
$$ Using $\frac{1}{2}$ instead of $1$ as the argument for $asin$, the third root of $e^\pi$ is obtained. $$
e^\frac{\pi}{3}=e^{2asin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{\left(e^{\pi}-\left(-1\right)^ke^{-\pi}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}+i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}-i\right)}{2\pi k!}
$$ For the sixth root of $e^{\pi}$ the argument of the gamma function becomes a single fraction. $$e^{\frac{\pi}{6}}=e^{asin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\left(e^{\frac{\pi}{2}} - (-1)^k e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k+i}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{k-i}{2}\right)}{4\pi k!}$$ Q1: How can Fraker's approximation be derived by truncating a series for a fractional power of $e^\pi$?

1604779,This theorem about matrices of linear maps doesn't look correct.,"Consider the following theorem: Theorem. Let $f\colon L\to M$ be a linear mapping of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Then there exist bases in $L$ and $M$ and a natural number $r$ such that the matrix of $f$ in these bases has the form $(a_{ij})$, where $a_{ii}=1$ for $1\leq i\leq r$ and $a_{ij}=0$ for the other values of $i,j$. Furthermore, $r$ is the rank of $f$. This theorem doesn't make much sense to me. Doesn't it imply that, for example, if $L$ and $M$ have the same dimension, every injective linear map can be represented by the identity matrix in some basis? This looks weird. Can you comment on this? It is a theorem in Section 8, Chapter 1 of Kostrikin and Manin's book ""Linear Algebra and Geometry"".

1604795,Evaluate Integral Using Change of Variables,"Let $A = \{(x, y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2-xy+2y^2<1 \}$; define $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x, y) = xy$. Express the integral $$\int_A f$$ as an integral over the unit ball $B = \{(x, y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2+y^2<1 \}$. Someone gave a solution here but it seems to be wrong. My attempt: Observe that $x^2-xy+2y^2=(x-\frac{1}{2}y)^2+(\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}y)^2$. Let $B^\ast = \{(r, \theta) | 0< r < 1, 0 < \theta < 2\pi\}$. Let $A^\ast = \{(x, y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2-xy+2y^2<1$, and $x<0$ if $y=0\}$. Then the function $$g(r, \theta) = (r\cos\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}r\sin\theta, \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}r\sin\theta)$$ carries $B^\ast$ in a one-to-one fasion onto $A-\{(0, 0)\}$. Now we obtain that \begin{align*}
\text{det} Dg & = 
\begin{vmatrix}\cos\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\sin\theta & -r\sin\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}r\cos\theta \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\sin\theta & \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}r\cos\theta \\ \end{vmatrix} \\
& = \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}r \\
& > 0
\end{align*} if $(r, \theta)\in B^\ast$. Since the non-negative $x$-axis has measure zero, using the formula of change of variables, we have that \begin{align*}
\int_A f 
& = \int_{A^\ast} f \\
& = \int_{B^\ast} f \circ g \cdot |\text{det} Dg| \\
& = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \Big((r\cos\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}r\sin\theta)\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}r\sin\theta\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}r \Big) drd\theta \\

& = \frac{2}{7}\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \Big( \sin2\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}(1-\cos2\theta) \Big)r^3 drd\theta \\

& = \frac{2}{7}\int_0^{2\pi} \Big[ \frac{1}{4}\Big( \sin2\theta-\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\cos2\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \Big)r^4 \Big]_{r=0}^{r=1} d\theta \\
& = \frac{2}{7}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{4}\Big( \sin2\theta-\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\cos2\theta+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \Big) d\theta \\

1604810,$5$ questions on the definition of the Gelfand triple,"Let $(H,\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle)$ be a Hilbert space over $\mathbb F\in\left\{\mathbb R,\mathbb C\right\}$ , $\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|$ be the norm induced by $\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle$ and $\Phi$ be a subspace of $H$ . Question 1 : Why can we find a finer topology $\tau$ on $\Phi$ such that $$\iota:(\Phi,\tau)\to(H,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|)\;,\;\;\;x\mapsto x\tag 1$$ is continuous? Question 2 : Why is it no loss to assume that $\Phi$ is dense in $(H,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|)$ ? Now, let $$\Phi^\ast\stackrel{\text{def}}=\left\{f:\Phi\to\mathbb F\mid f\text{ is continuous and linear}\right\}\tag 2$$ denote the dual space of $\Phi$ . Then, for all $f\in\Phi^*$ there is exactly one $\phi\in\Phi$ such that $$f\equiv\langle\;\cdot\;,\phi\rangle\tag 3$$ by the Fréchet-Riesz representation theorem . Let me quote from the Wikipedia article about the Gelfand triple : We consider the inclusion of dual spaces $H^\ast$ in $\Phi^\ast$ . The latter, dual to $\Phi$ in its 'test function' topology, is realised as a space of distributions or generalised functions of some sort, and the linear functionals on the subspace $\Phi$ of type $$\phi\mapsto\langle v,\phi\rangle$$ for $v$ in $H$ are faithfully represented as distributions (because we assume $\Phi$ dense). I can't make much sense of this paragraph. Question 3 : In $(1)$ we had considered the inclusion of $\Phi$ in $H$ . Why do we now consider the inclusion of $H^\ast$ in $\Phi^\ast$ ? Moreover, given the definition of the dual space in $(2)$ , we won't have $H^\ast\subseteq\Phi^\ast$ unless $\Phi=H$ . So, what is meant by inclusion here? Question 4 : What do they mean by 'test function' topology ? Is that just a fancy name for $\tau$ ? Question 5 : I have no idea what they mean in the last sentence. I'm not familiar with distributions. Is this somehow related to $(3)$ ? And why do we need the density of $\Phi^\ast$ ?","['hilbert-spaces', 'distribution-theory', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

$f$ is monotonous exactly if the pre-images of convex sets are convex. Now the latter condition can of course be defined for any map between real linear spaces. Obviously there it won't correspond to monotony (after all, what would it mean that a function $\mathbb R^m\to\mathbb R^n$ is monotonous?). However I wonder: Is there any other intuitive property that is connected to the demand that pre-images of convex sets are convex?","['convex-analysis', 'functions']"
