2437848,Why I should believe that the derivative of the determinant is the trace,"Using a Taylor expansion, it is not hard to show that the derivative of the determinant function at the identity is the trace:
$$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{ \det(I + tA) - \det(I) }{ t } = \operatorname{tr}(A).
$$
The determinant of a matrix may be viewed as the change in area of regions in $\mathbb{R}^n$.  A square of area $1$ will be converted to a shape of area $\det(A)$.  This change in area is the product of the eigenvalues, as opposed to the sum.

Let $T^{\mathbb{C}}M$ be the complexification of $TM$, that is:
$$T^{\mathbb{C}}M:=TM\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}=TM\oplus iTM,$$

$$T^{(1,0)}M:=\coprod_{x\in M}E_i(J_{\vert T_x^{\mathbb{C}}M}).$$ Why are $T^{(1,0)}M$ and $T^{(0,1)}M$ vector bundles?

Let $\xi$ be a vector bundle and let $F$ be an endomorphism of $\xi$, when is $\ker(F)$ a vector bundle? It seems that the question is non-empty since the dimension of $\ker(F_{\vert E_b})$ can change with the point $b\in B$, where $p\colon E\rightarrow B$ is the projection of $\xi$, which obviously prevents $\ker(F)$ from being a vector bundle.

Goal: show that $\forall$ $\epsilon>0$ $\exists$ $\delta>0$ such that $0 < \sqrt {(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}<\delta\Rightarrow0<|xy-1|<\epsilon$ Proof: If $0 < \sqrt {(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}<\delta$, then $|xy-1|=|xy-x-y+1+x+y-2|=|(x-1)(y-1)+(x-1)+(y-1)|$ $\le|(x-1)(y-1)|+|x-1| +|y-1|=|x-1||y-1|+|x-1|+|y-1|$ $=(\sqrt{(x-1)^2})(\sqrt{(y-1)^2})+\sqrt{(x-1)^2}+\sqrt{(y-1)^2}$ $\le(\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2})^2+2\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}<\delta^2+2\delta$ If $\delta=$$\epsilon \over4$, then $\delta^2+2\delta=\frac{\epsilon^2}{16}+\frac{8\epsilon}{16}=\frac{\epsilon^2+8\epsilon}{16}$ Now, $\frac{\epsilon^2+8\epsilon}{16}<\epsilon \Leftrightarrow \epsilon^2+8\epsilon<16\epsilon\Leftrightarrow\epsilon(\epsilon-8)<0$ Since $\epsilon>0$, we have $\epsilon(\epsilon-8)<0$ if and only if $\epsilon<8$ So if we have $\epsilon<8$, then we can pick $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{4}$ which gives us $\delta^2+2\delta<\epsilon$. If $\epsilon \ge8$, then we can pick $\delta=2$ which gives us $\delta^2+2\delta\le\epsilon$. Therefore, if we pick $\delta =$ min {${\frac{\epsilon}{4}, 2}$}, then $0 < \sqrt {(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}<\delta$ implies $0<|xy-1|<\epsilon$ Thus, $\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (1,1)} xy=1$","['multivariable-calculus', 'epsilon-delta', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"

2438543,Wanting to check that finite-type morphisms of integral schemes restrict to finite morphisms,"So I am only just starting to become familiar with schemes, and having had some previous work checked, I seem to have a habit of overlooking subtitles which I would really like to have cleared up early. I realize it's a big post, but I would really appreciate if anyone could have a look through and see if what I have done seems valid (or if there are any suggestions of more elegant solutions). So the question is from Hartshorne, II (exercise 3.7). I am given a dominant, finite-type, generically finite morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Y$  of integral schemes. I am required to show that there is an open dense subset $U \subseteq Y$ such that the induced morphism $f^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U$ is finite. The following is my attempt at a solution. Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a finite-type morphism of integral schemes. Let $\eta \in Y$ be the generic point of $Y$ and let $\varepsilon \in X$ be the generic point of $X$ (each scheme has a unique generic point since they are irreducible). Since each scheme is the topological closure of their generic point, it must be the case that any open set must contain the generic point, and hence must be dense. Now choose any affine open set $\text{Spec } B$ of $Y$, and since $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ is finite type, we have that 
$$
f^{-1} (\text{Spec }B) = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{N} \text{Spec } A_{i}
$$
where each $A_{i}$ is a finitely generated $B$-algebra, via morphisms
$$
\phi_{i}: B \longrightarrow A_{i}.
$$
Since $X$ is irreducible, any of the $\text{Spec } A_{i}$ are dense and must contain the generic point $\varepsilon$. Now choose a particular one of the $\text{Spec }A_{i}$ which contains $f(\eta)$, call it $\text{Spec } A$. Now we have that the morphism
$$
g:=f|_{\text{Spec }}: \text{Spec } A \longrightarrow \text{Spec }B
$$
is itself dominant, since its image includes the generic point of $\text{Spec } B$. Now we claim that the corresponding morphism of algebras
$$
\phi: B \longrightarrow A
$$
is injective. Suppose we have $h \in B$ with $\phi(h)= 0$. Then we have
$$
g^{-1}(D(h)) = D(\phi(h)) = D(0) = \emptyset.
$$
But since $g$ is dominant, this must mean that $D(h)$ is empty, which can only happen if $h$ is nilponent. But since $B$ is an integral domain, we have that $h = 0$. By definition of $A$ being a finitely generated $B$-algebra, we have an exact sequence
$$
B[x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{m}] \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow 0
$$
Now let $S$ be the multiplicative set of $B$ of all non-zero elements. By right exactness of the tensor product (treating $A$ as a $B$-module), we have
$$
S^{-1}B [x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{m}] \longrightarrow A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B \longrightarrow 0
$$
The ring $S^{-1}B$ is the field of fractions of $B$ by definition. I claim also that $A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B$ is the field of fractions of $A$. Indeed any map $A \longrightarrow R$ to some ring $R$ which sends all non-zero elements of $A$ to invertible elements in $R$ can be precomposed with $\phi$, and by the injectivity of $\phi$, this becomes a map $B \longrightarrow R$ that sends every non-zero element of $B$ to an invertible element. Then by the universal property of the localization of $B$, as well as the universal property for the tensor product, we can show that $A \otimes_{B} S^{-1}B$ satisfies the appropriate universal property. We denote the function fields of $X$ and $Y$ by $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ and $\kappa(\eta)$ respectively. This gives us an exact sequence
$$
\kappa(\eta) [x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{m}] \longrightarrow \kappa(\varepsilon) \longrightarrow 0.
$$
And so $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ is finitely generated as an algebra over $\kappa(\eta)$. But then by Zariski's lemma, this is a finite field extension. Now observe that $\text{Spec } (\kappa(\varepsilon))$ and $\text{Spec } (\kappa(\eta))$ are open sets of $X$ and $Y$ respectively via immerions
\begin{align*}
\text{Spec }(\kappa(\varepsilon)) \hookrightarrow \text{Spec } A \hookrightarrow X \\
\text{Spec }(\kappa(\eta)) \hookrightarrow \text{Spec } B \hookrightarrow Y \\
\end{align*}
and since we already have that $\kappa(\varepsilon)$ is a finite $\kappa(\eta)$-module (vector space), it remains only to show that $f^{-1}(\text{Spec }(\kappa(\eta))) = \text{Spec }(\kappa(\varepsilon))$, or equivalently, that $f^{-1}(\eta) = \{ \varepsilon \}$. Now suppose $p \in X$ is any point such that $f(p) = \eta$. Then we have morphisms
$$
\mathcal{O}_{Y, \eta} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, p} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X, \varepsilon}
$$
where the first map arises from the morphism of schemes, and the second arises from universal property of the colimit since $p$ is a specialization of $\varepsilon$. But since $\mathcal{O}_{Y, \eta}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{X, \varepsilon}$ are themselves fields, we deduce that $\mathcal{O}_{X, p}$ is a field. So then we find that $p$ is generic, and since the generic point is unique, we have that $p = \varepsilon$.","['schemes', 'finitely-generated', 'algebraic-geometry', 'proof-verification']"

In the book ""Applied Mathematics"" by Schelkunoff, p.194, the author also gives the following exposition (note that primed symbols denote derivative with $x$): ""The equation gives merely a relationship between the function and its first two derivatives... Since the coefficient of the second-order derivative is different from zero, $y$ and $y'$ may be assigned arbitrarily at the point in question without any exceptions; $y''$ is then determined uniquely. By successive differentiation of the ODE we may express all higher derivatives in terms of $y$ and $y'$ at a given point. Applying Taylor's theorem we shall get the most general analytic solution of the ODE. ""We shall be able to claim that the solution in (1) is the most general analytic solution if we can show that at some point, $x=0$ for instance, we can express $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ in terms of arbitrarily assigned values of $y(0)$ and $y'(0)$. We leave the proof to the reader."" Question: I don't have a problem in proving that $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are expressible in terms of $y(x_{0})$ and $y'(x_{0})$ at some point $x_{0}$, but I am not sure why we can make such general claim (in the second quoted paragraph) if we simply proved such connection? Why would that mean that the two solution types ($y$ given in (1) above and Taylor's expansion) be equivalent at all other points, as to make $y$ in (1) the most general solution? When I tried to expand for Taylor's solution in terms of $y(0)$ and $y'(0)$, I got: $$ y(x)=y(0)\left[ 1-\frac{x^{2}}{2}q +\frac{x^{3}}{3}pq+\cdots\right]+y'(0)\left[ x-\frac{x^{2}}{2}p +\frac{x^{3}}{3}(p^{2}-q)+\cdots\right],\ \ \ \ (2)$$ which can be clearly used to give $A_{1},A_{2}$ at $x=0$ in terms of $y(0),y'(0)$, without problem. But what is not clear is that proving such connection at a point basis (such as $x=0$ here) would be enough to conclude that the two solutions are equivalent in gerenal, and therefore for the form $y$ in (1) to become the most general solution according to the author's argument.

2438672,Partial differentiation notation in thermodynamics,"In my thermodynamics notes, the definition of isothermal heat capacity at constant volume is

To me, the partial derivative of entropy with respect to temperature would correspond to the ""slope in the temperature direction"", meaning that all other variables are considered to be ""frozen"".

Many youtube playlists prove interesting things, although I haven't found one that proves the Abel-Ruffini theorem. All the blogs I've seen that attempt to provide a proof for people who know practically nothing of group/fiels theory fall short (the authors seem to have abandoned them halfway through). And I have heard of books that could work, although with work and college I would like to leave this as the last option. My question then is, has someone by any chance encountered a complete proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem that could be understood by a beginner in group/field theory?

2439017,Choice Set is Uncountable,"Show that any choice set for the rational equivalence relation on a set of positive outer measure must be uncountably infinite I have been thinking about this problem on and off for a few days, but I haven't been able to come with much. Let $E$ be a set with positive outer measure, and $C_E$ some choice set of $E$. I know that $E$ must be uncountable, otherwise it will have a outer measure of zero. This means that $E$ must contain an uncountable number of irrational numbers. Initially I thought that the equivalence class of an irrational would be a singleton,  but this isn't so since $(1-\pi) + \pi = 1$. I could use a hint. EDIT: Let $[x] = \{y \in E ~|~ x-y \in \Bbb{Q} \}$ denote the rational equivalence class of the on $E$ of the element $x \in E$. Then $[x] = \{x + q ~|~ \mbox{ for some } q \in \Bbb{Q}\}$, which suggests that the elements of $[x]$ can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with some subset $\Bbb{Q}$, making the cardinality of $[x]$ at most countably infinite. As I noted above, a set with positive outer measure must be uncountably infinite. Now if there were only a countably infinite number of equivalence classes, then these equivalence classes, which partition $E$, couldn't add up to make the uncountable set $E$ (i.e., it would be impossible for their union to be $E$). Hence, there must be an uncountable number of equivalence classes. Since $C_E$ is formed by taking a single element from each equivalence class, it's clear that $C_E$ must also be uncountably infinite. How does that sound?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

Now if we multiple both sides of the equation $n=2n$ by $\frac{n+1}{n}$, we get $n\frac{n+1}{n}=2n\frac{n+1}{n}$, so $n+1=2(n+1)$. Thus $P(n+1)$ holds and this completes the proof by induction.

If yes, find the differential $DF$. To me, it seems that this is a straight forward application of Leibniz Rule, but I've never applied it in such a setting: Treating $y$ as a constant, we can describe F(x,y) (somewhat inelegantly) as $$\int_{h_1(x)}^{h_2(x)} \int_{g_1(x,v)}^{g_2(x,v)} f\,du\,dv$$

2439742,A model for conformal structures on polygon,"By a conformal structure on a polygon, I mean all the vertices of a polygon are missing (or, equivalently, it has ideal vertices), so that it can be considered as a conformal structure on the unit disk which has on the boundary unit circle marked points corresponding to the vertices of the polygon(This is just a simple application of the uniformization theorem). And there's yet another model for this that often appears in literature; The above is a model for a 7-gon of which I took a snapshot from Baldwin . Here each half-infinite band corresponds to a neighborhood of the vertices of the 7-gon, and there exist segments perpendicular to the ""edges of the polygon"" which is shown as the curves bounding the polygon and also as the height of rectangular regions in the diagram above. Then the conformal structures on the given 7-gon is parametrized by $I_1$ to $I_4$, which are the height of rectangular regions. Of course, we assume that there exist perpendiculars for every pair of edges of the polygon, and you have freedom to choose which 4 disjoint perpendiculars (($n-3$) such perpendiculars in $n$-gon in general) to parametrize the conformal structures. The claim that I want to verify is that this indeed parametrizes all the conformal structures on a given polygon, and thus that the dimension of the moduli space of conformal structures of $n$-gon is precisely $n-3$ as expected. It is not even obvious to me that this parametrization is surjective though. Any idea or suggestion of references is appreciated. Edit. After the discussion with Moishe Cohen, it seems not true in general that this parametrization is surjective.

2439943,Showing that the fiber of a morphism of schemes over a point is homeomorphic to the preimage,"Suppose I am given a morphism of schemes $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ and suppose that for any point $y \in Y$, $\kappa(y)$ denotes the residue field. I would like to show that the fibered product $$X \times_{Y} \text{Spec}(\kappa(y))$$ is homeomorphic to the preimage $f^{-1}(y)$ in the induced topology. The following is my attempt so far: The question is obviously affine on the target, so without loss of generality we reduce to the case of a morphism $f: X \longrightarrow \text{Spec }A$. Then we have 
$$
f^{-1}(\text{Spec }A) = \bigcup_{i \in I} \text{Spec }B_{i}
$$
via morphisms
$$
\phi_{i}: A \longrightarrow B_{i}.
$$
We can then write,
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}(\text{Spec } A) \times_{\text{Spec } A}\text{Spec } \kappa(y) &= \bigcup_{i \in I} \left( \text{Spec } B_{i} \times_{\text{Spec }A} \text{Spec }\kappa(y) \right) \\
 &= \bigcup_{i \in I} \text{Spec }  \left( B_{i} \otimes_{A} \kappa(y)  \right).
\end{align*}
Now let $\mathfrak{p}$ be the prime ideal of $A$ corresponding to the point $y \in \text{Spec } A$. Then $\kappa(y) = (A/ \mathfrak{p})_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Then for any of the $B$ (dropping the index for brevity), we have
\begin{align*}
B\otimes_{A} (A/ \mathfrak{p})_{\mathfrak{p}} &\simeq B \otimes_{A} A / \mathfrak{p} \otimes_{A} A_{\mathfrak{p}} \\
&\simeq B_{\mathfrak{p}} \otimes_{A} A / \mathfrak{p} \\
& \simeq B_{\mathfrak{p}} / \mathfrak{p}B_{\mathfrak{p}}
\end{align*} Now the prime ideals in $B_{\mathfrak{p}} / \mathfrak{p}B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ correspond precisely to the prime ideals of $B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ containing $\mathfrak{p}B_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Further, the prime ideals of $B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ correspond precisely to the prime ideals of $B$ contained in $\phi(\mathfrak{p})B$. That is, we have
\begin{align}
\text{Spec }B_{\mathfrak{p}} &= \{  \mathfrak{q} \subseteq B :  \phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})  \subseteq \mathfrak{p}  \} \\
&=  \{ \mathfrak{q} \subseteq B : f(\mathfrak{\mathfrak{q}}) \subseteq \mathfrak{p}      \}.
\end{align}
Note that in the very last line we have abused notation slightly: There is not really any notion of being ""inside"" $\mathfrak{p}$ when it is being treated as a point in the scheme. So really we mean that $f(\mathfrak{q})$ is a point in the scheme whose corresponding prime ideal is a subset of $\mathfrak{p}$. Now as we said above, the prime ideals of $B_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{p}B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ are the following
$$
\text{Spec }(B_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{p}B_{\mathfrak{p}}) = \{ \mathfrak{q} \subseteq B : f(\mathfrak{\mathfrak{q}}) \subseteq \mathfrak{p}      \text{ and } ???  \}

Let $u, v,w$ be three distinct vertices in $G$ .How many simple paths are there from $u$ to $v$ going through $w$ ? My Approach I first selected $u,v$ from $10$ vertices by $$\binom{10}{2}$$ then $w$ from remianing $8$ by $$\binom{8}{1}$$ So my possible number of simple path from $u$ to $v$ = $$\binom{10}{2}*\binom{8}{1}*7!$$ But answer seems wrong. Where am i wrong?

2440211,"Find the lowest $\mathbb{Z}$, $x \geqslant 100$ that when divided with 83 and 47 gives a rest of 3","I try to apply the chinese rest theorem. This is how I tried to do it.
$$
\begin{cases}
  x \equiv 3(mod \quad 83)\\
  x \equiv 3(mod \quad 47)  
\end{cases}
$$
First I want to know if a solution exists, so I take $sgd(83,47)$. Applying Euklides algorithm. $$
83=47*1+36 \implies \\47 = 36*1 + 11 \implies \\36=11*3+3 \implies \\11=3*3 + 2 \implies \\3=2*1 + 1 \implies \\2 = 1*2 + 0 
$$
So $sgd(83,47) = 1$, solution exist. Applying Euklides algorithm backwards to find $1=83u+47v$.
$$
1=3-2 \implies \\1=3-(11-3*3) \implies\\ 1=3*4-(47-36) \implies \\ ... \implies \\1=17(83)-30(47)
$$
So $u=17$ and $v=-30$. We know that $x_{0} = a_{2}m_{1}u+a_{1}m_{2}v$, so $x_{0} = 3*83*17-3*47*30 \implies x_{0}=2823$. Now $x$ should be $x=2823+(83*47)n \implies x=2823 + 3801n$. So when $n=1$ the answer should be $x=6624$ but it is wrong, the answer is $x=3904$.

2440452,"Is there a flaw on ""Galois for beginners""?","I guess that the following question is only for those who by any chance have read the text "" Galois for beginners "" by John Stillwell.  Although the text is short and there might be some remarkable people that might be able to read it and understand it fast enough. In any case, I'm thankful to anyone who answers. The aim of the text is to prove that there is no solution by radicals for polynomials of degree 5 or higher, and the issue I'm having is that the author seems to have made a mistake on a proof along the way. Reading this text -as brief as it is- is proving to be really hard for me, since I know little about abstract algebra, but it is the shortest 'proof' I've been able to find. What I wish to know, is if this mistake the author made will at the end ruin the whole proof (meaning that I would have lost my time) or if even with this flaw, the author is still able to prove Abel-Ruffini Theorem. The flaw: (For context, $x_1,...,x_n$ refer to the roots of a generic $n$th degree polynomial) Theorem (page $4$ of the pdf. ). ""for each radical extension $E$ of $ℚ(x_1,...,x_n)$ there is a radical extension $E′/E$ with automorphisms extending all permutations $σ$ of $x_1,...,x_n$."" Proof.
 ""for each adjoined element, represented by the expression $e(x_1,...,x_n)$, and each permutation $σ$ of $x_1,...,x_n$ adjoin the element $e(σx_1,...,σx_n)$. Since there are only finitely many permutations of $σ$ then, the resulting field $E'⊇E$ is also a radical extension of $ℚ(x_1,...,x_n)$. This gives a bijection (also called $σ$ ) of $E'$ sending each $f(x_1,...,x_n)∈E'$ (a rational function of $x_1,...x_n$ and the adjoined elements) to $f(σx_1,...,σx_n)$, and this bijection is clearly an automorphism of $E′$, extending the permutation $σ$."" This theorem should hold for a generic polynomial $P$, but it doesn't, since something like this might happen: Let's say that $(x_1)^2+x_2^2=(x_3)^2$, yet $(σx_1)^3+(σx_2)^2≠(σx_3)^2$, meaning that $σ$ has mapped the same element into two different places, meaning that $σ$ can not be an automorphism. For a specific example let $x_1=i$, $x_2=3^{1/2}$ and $x_3=2^{1/2}$. So the theorem doesn't hold for all polynomials. Will this at the end ruin the proof? Or is just insignificant to consider the polynomials in which the flaw occurs? I will really appreciate any help/thoughts.","['galois-theory', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'field-theory']"
