1606816,Linear span in the intersection of Hilbert spaces,"Let $V$ be a vector space. Assume $H_1$ and $H_2$ are subspaces of $V$, and that both $H_1$ and $H_2$ are Hilbert spaces with inner-products $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle_1$ and $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_2$ respectively. Let $x\in H_1$, and let $\left\{h_n,\,n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$ be an orthonormal set in $H_1$ (not necessarily a basis) such that $$\big\Vert x - \sum_{k=1}^n\langle x, h_k\rangle_1 h_k\big\Vert_1 \underset{n\rightarrow\infty}\longrightarrow 0,$$ that is, $x$ lies in the closed linear span of $\left\{h_n\right\}$. Assume now that $x\in H_2$ and $\left\{h_n\right\}\subset H_2$. Notice that since $\left\{h_n\right\}$ is orthonormal in $H_1$, it is linearly independent in $H_1$ and hence in $V$ and $H_2$, but not necessarily orthogonal in $H_2$. Let $\left\{e_n,\,n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$ be an orthonormal set in $H_2$ obtained by a Gram-Schmidt process on $\left\{h_n\right\}$, that is, such that $\mbox{span}\left\{e_1,\dots,e_n\right\} = \mbox{span}\left\{h_1,\dots,h_n\right\}$ for each $n$. Is it true that $$\big\Vert x - \sum_{k=1}^n\langle x, e_k\rangle_2 e_k\big\Vert_2 \underset{n\rightarrow\infty}\longrightarrow 0?$$ Edited In response to user gerw: let me be more specific and maybe we can relate the two norms. Given two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$, both equivalent to Lebesgue measure , let $V$ be the vector space of $\mu$-equivalence classes of measurable functions $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ (which is of course equal to the set of $\nu$-equivalence classes of such functions), let $H_1 = L^2(\mu)$ and $H_2 = L^2(\nu)$. Let $T_\mu:L^2(\mu)\rightarrow L^2(\mu)$ be the positive Hilbert-Schmidt operator defined by $$T_\mu f(x) = \int c(x,y) f(y) d\mu(y),\qquad f\in L^2(\mu)$$ where $c$ is a bounded, measurable kernel . Define $T_\nu$ similarly. I am given a certain bounded measurable function $\varphi$ such that both $$\big\Vert \varphi - \sum_{k=1}^n\langle \varphi, h^\mu_k\rangle_1 h^\mu_k\big\Vert_1 \underset{n\rightarrow\infty}\longrightarrow 0\quad \mbox{and} \quad\big\Vert \varphi - \sum_{k=1}^n\langle \varphi, h^\nu_k\rangle_2 h^\nu_k\big\Vert_2 \underset{n\rightarrow\infty}\longrightarrow 0$$ hold, where $\left\{h^\mu_n\right\}$ is the orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of $T_\mu$, and similarly for $\left\{h^\nu_n\right\}$. I'd like to show that $\varphi$ is the $\Vert\cdot\Vert_2$-limit of linear combinations of the $h^\mu_n$. My question can be rephrased as follows: is the $\Vert\cdot\Vert_2$-closure of $\mbox{span}\left\{h_n^\mu\right\}$ equal to the $\Vert\cdot\Vert_2$-closure of $\mbox{span}\left\{h_n^\nu\right\}$?","['functional-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces']"

The theorem states that for every subset $S \subseteq Z$: $$(g\circ f)^{-1}[S]=f^{-1}(g^{-1}[S])$$ So the thing is to show that two sets above are equal. My attempt would be: Let $M=(g\circ f)^{-1}[S] = \{x\in X | g(f(x))\in S\}$. then $g^{-1}[S]$ is a set $G=\{y\in Y | g(y))\in S\}$, and $f^{-1}(g^{-1}[S])=\{x\in X | f(x) \in G\}$.

1607027,Example of a subnet that have no subsequence.,"I have an elementary question on nets because I'm not familiar with this concept. Here are two basic facts: Every subsequence of a sequence is a subnet; Not every subnet of a sequence is a subsequence. For the second fact, I have seen the following example: Given a sequence $(x_n)=(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,...)$, the net $$(x_\alpha)=(x_1,x_2,x_2,x_3,x_3,...,x_{1+[\frac{n}{2}]},...)$$ is a subnet of $(x_n)$ that is not a subsequence of $(x_n)$. In this example, $(x_\alpha)$ has a subnet which is a subsequence of $(x_n)$, namely, the sequence $(x_n)$. Could someone give me an example where this doesn't happen? Explicitly: I'd like an example of sequence $(x_n)$ and a subnet $(x_\alpha)$ of $(x_n)$ such that no subnet of $(x_\alpha)$ is a subsequence of $(x_n)$. Motivation for the question: I have a bounded sequence in the dual of a normed space. If the space was separable, then I could pass to a weak-* convergent subsequence. However the space is not separable. So, all I have is a subnet weak-* convergent. Presumably, I can't pass to a subsequence. As I said, I'm not familiar with the concept of net and thus I'd like to see an example where the existence of the subsequence fails.","['examples-counterexamples', 'nets', 'functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

1607191,Example for conjugate points with only one connecting geodesic,"$\newcommand{\ga}{\gamma}$
$\newcommand{\al}{\alpha}$ I would like to find an example for a Riemannian manifold, that has
two conjugate points $p,q$ with only one connecting geodesic between them. (This is the geodesic they are conjugate along) Explanation: Consider a parametrized family of geodesics starting from a fixed point $p$, i.e: $\ga_s(t)=\ga(t,s), \ga_s(0)=\ga_0(0)=p$ where for each fixed $s$ , the path $t \to \ga_s(t)$ is a geodesic in $M$. Then $J(t)= \frac{\partial \ga}{\partial s}(t,0)$ is a Jacobi field, along the geodesic $\ga_0$. Moreover, every Jacobi field can be realized from such a variation of geodesics. By definition, if $p,q$ are conjugate along some geodesic $\al$, there exsits a nonzero Jacobi field along $\ga$ that vanishes at $p,q$. This means there is some variation $\ga(t,s)$ of $\al$ ($\ga_0=\al$) where  $J(t)= \frac{\partial \ga}{\partial s}(t,0)$. Assume $\al(t_0)=q$. Then $0=J(t_0)= \frac{\partial \ga}{\partial s}(t_0,0)$, so one can say that ""$\gamma_s(1)$, is the point $q$ only up to first order in $s$"", but we cannot conclude there exists an $s \neq 0$ such that $\ga_s(t_0)=q$. (Of course, if we knew that $\ga_s(t_0)=q$ for all $s \in (\epsilon,\epsilon)$ this would imply $J(t_0)=0$ but not vice-versa).

1607250,Underdetermined Linear Systems,"I'm working through an introductory linear algebra textbook and one exercise gives the system $2x+3y+5z+2w=0$ $-5x+6y-17z-3w=0$ $7x-4y+3z+13w=0$ And asks why, without doing any calculations, it has infinitely many solutions.

But I'm struggling to see how that implies that this new system has infinitely many solutions. I did some research and found that if an underdetermined linear system has a solution then it has infinitely many, but the explanations of this seem to talk about rank and other things that I'm not familiar with. So if someone could please explain why you can just tell without doing any calculation why this system has infinitely many solutions (I'm guessing it has something to do with the previous problem that's the same just without that fourth column of variables) from the authors perspective (i.e. they're only assuming we have algebra 2 at this early point in the book)  it would be much appreciated.",['linear-algebra']
1607264,Bezout's Identity proof and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm,"I am trying to learn the logic behind the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and I am having a really difficult time understanding all the online tutorials and videos out there. To make it clear, though, I understand the regular Euclidean Algorithm just fine. This is my reasoning for why it works: If $g = \gcd(a,b)$, then $gi = a$ and $gj = b$ with $\gcd(i,j)=1$. If you subtract the equations, then $g(i-j) = a-b$, which means $g$ divides $a-b$ too. This implies that $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(a-kb,b)$ and so the maximum $k$ is $a - kb = 0$ or $a = kb$ or $\lfloor a/b \rfloor = k$, and the value of $a-\lfloor a/b \rfloor b$ is the same as $a$ mod $b$. But I do not understand the Extended algorithm or the Identity. Why is there always an $x,y$ such that $ax + by = \gcd(a,b)$ for nonzero (positive?) $a,b$? I don't understand the intuition behind this claim. I also don't understand how the Extended Euclidean algorithm works at all. Is it correct to say that the Extended Euclidean algorithm is what solves Bezout's Identity? It returns nonzero (positive?) $x,y$ such that $ax + by = \gcd(a,b)$? Is the idea behind modular inverses included here too? If I want to solve for the inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ then this is the same as solving for $x$ in $ax = 1 \bmod m$ for known integers $a,m$, the same as $ax = 1 - my$, the same as $ax + my = 1$, so this is like using the Extended algorithm on $a,m$ and checking if the gcd is equal to $1$. If so, then the answer is $x$. Is my understanding correct?","['euclidean-algorithm', 'number-theory', 'algorithms', 'inverse', 'modular-arithmetic']"

A program that produces random drill problems on quadratic equations $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0,$ selects values for $A, B,$ and $C$ at random and independently from among the ten equally likely values $0.1, 0.2, \dots, 1.0$ . What proportion of such equations have real roots? And what proportion have only one root?

1607402,When does one consider the laplacian as a dirac delta function?,"If we consider that $$\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = -4\pi\delta(\vec{r})$$ we can explain the dirac-delta function here via the results of Gauss' law
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = \int_S\nabla\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\cdot d\vec{a} = \int_S \frac{-\hat{r}}{r^2}\cdot d\vec{a} = -4\pi\frac{R^2}{r^2} $$ where the surface integral has been taken over a sphere of radius $R$. Now, if we say $r>0$ and $R\to 0$, we get 
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = 0. $$
Furthermore, if we set $r=R$ and send $R\to0$ we get 
$$\int_V \nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right) = -4\pi $$ Thus we have demonstrated the validity of the first equation. However, if we were to directly calculate the Laplacian of $\frac 1r$ we obtain
$$\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\right) = 0$$ So it seems like the -$4\pi\delta(\vec{r})$ has somehow been neglected by the direct calculation. That being said, what about the case where we have, for some $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R} > 0$ $$\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r^\epsilon}\right) = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r^\epsilon}\right)\right) = \frac{(\epsilon-1)\epsilon}{r^{\epsilon+2}}$$ Has there also been a dirac delta function neglected here?

""Most wanted"" could refer, for example, to the following: results which are highly cited/reused in other publications/computations computational proofs of fundamental results counterexamples to central conjectures in a field checking correctness of various mathematical databases producing open source implementations of computations previously performed using another open or closed source software, or when the old code is not available at all landmark computations that one could be interested to reproduce ( in the same way like a chemistry reaction from a textbook could be reproduced by mixing baking soda and vinegar in your kitchen ). If the publication just says ""this result was produced using the system X"", it may be a long way to reproduce it. It may include a reference to exact version of the system, a link to the extra code to download, but again it may happen that that version has to be installed in some particular way to satisfy certain dependencies, the extra code is not well documented so it is unclear how to run it, some other special knowledge or non-trivial computational resources are needed, etc. On the other side, having these results easier reproducible could be crucial for science. Hypothetically, one could e.g. download a virtual machine and re-run the whole experiment, or use the newest version of the system to check whether the experiment still runs with the same outcome. I hope that making such a list of suggested experiments to reproduce will be useful to those interested in checking them twice ;-). For example, one could submit their findings to a journal like ReScience which ""targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research is reproducible"".

1608268,Why is my intuition wrong that one of two archers win in a tournament?,"The probability of Robin and Tuck hitting a target respectively are $0.45$ and $0.38$.  For each round of the tournament, each archer must shoot simultaneously at their targets. A player wins the tournament if in a round, one archer hits the target while the other does not. If both or neither archers hit the target, then the tournament is continued with another round and this process is repeated. Intuitively, I feel that the probability that Robin wins the tournament is $p=\frac{0.45}{0.38+0.45}\approx0.5421686%$, but to be on the safe side, I did the below: Consider the two cases in which Robin wins the tournament: 
Either a) Robin wins on his first shot, or b) Robin ties on his first shot but wins on the $n^{\text{th}}$ round, $n > 1$. Let $p$ denote the probability that robin wins. Case a: If Robin wins on his first shot, that means he hit the target and Tuck missed the target. The probability of this is $(0.45)(1-0.38)=0.279$ Case b: The probability that no one wins on the first round is the probability that no one hits the target plus the probability that both hit the target, which is $(1-0.45)(1-0.38)+(0.45)(0.38)=0.512$. After the first round, when the second round starts, it is as if the entire tournament has just started. Therefore, after a tie in the $1^{\text{st}}$ round, Robin still has the same probability $p$ of winning on the $n^{\text{th}}$ round where $n>1$. Thus the probability that Robin ties the 1st round and wins some round after that is $0.512p$. Adding cases a and b gets that $p = 0.279 + 0.512p$. Solving for $p$ yields around  $0.5717213115$.

Two days ago, reading the book of Lewin ""Polylogarithms and Associated Functions"" I was able to find out formula (2). $\displaystyle \dfrac{1}{3}C=\int_0^1 \dfrac{1}{x}\arctan\left(\dfrac{x(1-x)}{2-x}\right)dx\tag1$ $\displaystyle \dfrac{2}{5}C=\int_0^1 \dfrac{1}{x}\arctan\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{5}x(1-x)}{1+\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{5}x}\right)dx-\int_0^1 \dfrac{1}{x}\arctan\left(\dfrac{x(1-x)}{3+\sqrt{5}-x}\right)dx\tag2$ $C$ being the Catalan's constant. I have a proof for both of these formulae. My approach relies on the following identity: For all real $x>1$ , $\displaystyle \int_0^1 \dfrac{1}{t} \arctan \left (\dfrac{t(1-t)}{\frac{x+1}{2}-t}\right) dt=\int_1^{\frac{\sqrt{x}+1}{\sqrt{x}-1}}\dfrac{\log(t)}{1+t^2}dt$","['catalans-constant', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"

If you move one of the points (not the 90 degree vertex) very far away, then the corresponding angle will become smaller as the point moves further away. The 90 degree angle will stay constant. The other angle will become bigger, approaching 90, keeping the total angle at 180, by definition. What happens of the point is at ""infinity,"" will you be left with two 90 degree angles? This is impossible as those sides would be parallel, and therefore ending up with a seemingly impossible shape (it can't be a triangle anymore).

$$\int_0^{\int_0^\ldots \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x$$

I tried to solve this by renaming the integral $\int_0^\ldots \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x$ in the upper limit $U$, so that we get
$$\int_0^{\int_0^\ldots \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x =\int_0^U \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \ \mathrm{d}x=\left[2\sqrt{x} \vphantom{\frac 1 1} \right]_0^U = 2\sqrt{U}$$
If we now consider that the integral in the upper limit $U$ is in fact equal to the original definite integral which we are trying to evaluate, we find that $U=2\sqrt{U}\Rightarrow U^2=4U\Rightarrow U^2-4U=0$, which is a quadratic equation with solutions $U_1=4$ and $U_2=0$.

Then each orbit is a smooth, locally closed subset of $X$, whose boundary is a union of orbits of strictly lower dimension. Proof: Let $Y$ be an orbit in $X$.  As the continuous image of a closed set, $Y$ is constructible, and hence contains an open dense subset of $\overline{Y}$.  But $G$ acts transitively on $Y$ (and hence stablizes $\overline{Y}$), so $Y$ is smooth and contains a neighborhood in $\overline{Y}$ of each of its points, i.e. $Y$ is open in $\overline{Y}$.  Therefore, $\overline Y \setminus Y$ is closed and of strictly lower dimension than $\overline{Y}$.  Being $G$-stable, this boundary is just a union of other orbits. Two questions: first, why is $Y$ is open in $\overline{Y}$?  I don't understand why each point in $Y$ admits an open neighborhood in $\overline{Y}$.

conditions (a grid of them, in 2D case) and coloring them according
to the attractor that the system eventually converges to. Looking
at the boundary of these basins of attraction in terms of fractal
dimension , Wada property , etc. I noticed that the generalized Newton's method $$
z_{n+1}=z_n- a \frac{p(z_n)}{p'(z_n)}
$$
gives somewhat interesting results even for a relatively straighforward polynomial $p(z) = z^3-1$. Below you can see basins of attraction for a few different $a \in \mathbb{C}$ values. However I received criticism that the model is maybe too simple. 
The discussion shifted to suggestions to look at some other systems namely Henon-Hailes system (which is not discrete at all) and forced Duffing oscillator (which also has to be integrated numerically).

It is the first time I encounter such question, where I have to check maximum / minimum of a point in a function with two variables instead of one variable, so I went to wikipedia to learn more about how to approach it. I see that I have to calculate the determinant of the Hessian matrix, noted as D in wiki. So, I calculated: $$D(x,y)=\det(H(x,y))=f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y)-\left(f_{xy}(x,y)\right)^2$$ The result is: $-2 * 0 - (2b)^2$ (Since I have no variables in the second derivatives, the result is constant numbers and I don't have to assign the actual point).

1608750,Bounds on probability of sample mean in a small neighborhood rather than the tail,"Say we have i.i.d random variables $x_i$ whose mean and variance are $1$. Then the sample $s_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ has mean $1$ and variance $\frac{1}{n}$. If we are given a small enough positive $\epsilon$, e.g., $\epsilon\in(0,0.5)$, what bound can we get for $P(0<s_n<\epsilon)$ for all $n$? For example, if we consider the Chebyshev inequality, we have
\begin{align}
P(0<s_n<\epsilon)&\leq P(|s_n-1|\geq 1-\epsilon)\\
&=P(|s_n-1|\geq \sqrt{n}(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})\\
&\leq\frac{1}{n(1-\epsilon)^2}

This bound is rather loose because of the first inequality. I also checked other inequalities, like Hoeffding's, yet they are all bounds for the form of $P(|s_n-1|\geq a)$. If we think about $x\sim\mathcal{N}(1,1)$, then $s_n\sim\mathcal{N}(1,\frac{1}{n})$.

1608792,Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution of random variables,"I am studying Professor Rick Durrett's book ""Probability: Theory and Examples"" and would greatly appreciate feedback on the validity of my proof.

Given a sequence of distribution functions $F_n$, $F_n\to F$ weakly (also known as convergence in distribution) means $F_n(y)\to F(y)$ for all points $y$ that are continuity points of $F$. Given a sequence of random variables $X_n$ with $F_n$ the distribution function of each $X_n$, $X_n\to X$ weakly means $F_n\to F$ weakly. Proof: Let $g$ be a continuous, bounded function. Recall that $X_n\to X$ in probability implies that for every subsequence $X_{n(m)}$, there exists a convergent sub-subsequence $X_{n(m_k)}$ so that $X_{n(m_k)}\to X$ almost surely, and hence $g(X_{n(m_k)})\to g(X)$ almost surely. Then $Eg(X_{n(m_k)})\to Eg(X)$ by the dominated convergence theorem. Since the subsequence $X_{n(m)}$ was arbitrary, we have $Eg(X_n)\to Eg(X)$. Further, since $g$ was arbitrary, $X_n\to X$ weakly.

Improve this question Problem statement: We are 3 friends at 3 different locations $A, B, C$ and want to reach a location $D$. Each person will take a separate cab to a common meeting point $E$, and then take a single cab from $E$ to $D$. How can I find the point $E$ which minimizes the total distance traveled by all four cabs?","['plane-geometry', 'optimization', 'quadrilateral', 'triangles', 'geometry']"
1608982,Discussion of $Z(A_4) = \{e\}$,"I tried to answer the following question: Why does the fact that the orders of the elements of $A_4$ are $1,2$
  and $3$ imply that $|Z(A_4)|=1$? My answer: Two cycles commute if and only if they are disjoint. But no combination of $2$-cycles and $3$-cycles in $A_4$ can ever be disjoint since there are only $4$ numbers. Hence the centre must be trivial. Then I looked at the answer: If there was $x$ in $Z(A_4)$ of order $2$ then a product with a $3$-cycle would have order $6$. If there was $x$ in $Z(A_4)$ of order $3$ then a product with a $2$-cycle would have order $6$. I have two questions about this question: (1) Is my proof correct? and: (2) Is it a general principle that if the goal is to show the centre
  of $S_n$ is trivial one assumes by contradiction it wasn't and then
  produces an element with order too large to be in $S_n$?","['permutations', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification']"
1609027,Why is this a group action - what is the significance of $g^{-1}$?,"Let $G$ be a group acting on a variety $X$ such that every $g\in G$
  defines a morphism $\phi_g:X\rightarrow X$ given by $\phi_g(x)=g\cdot x$. If $X=\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is affine then $\phi_g$ comes from a
  map $\phi_g^*:R\rightarrow R$. We define the induced action of $G$ on
  $R$ by $$g\cdot f=\phi_{g^{-1}}^{*}(f)$$ for $f\in R$ In other words, $(g\cdot f)(x)=f(g^{-1}\cdot x)$ for all $x\in X$ I have two questions - Why do we need $g^{-1}$ to ensure that $G$ induces an action on $R$? We have - $$(g_1 g_2)\cdot f=\phi^*_{(g_1g_2)^{-1}}(f)=\phi^*_{g_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}}(f)=(\phi^*_{g_2^{-1}}\phi^*_{g_1^{-1}})(f)$$
At this point I am confused as $$(\phi^*_{g_2^{-1}}\phi^*_{g_1^{-1}})(f)=\phi^*_{g_2^{-1}}(\phi^*_{g_1^{-1}}(f))=\phi^*_{g_2^{-1}}(g_1\cdot f)=g_2\cdot(g_1\cdot f)$$ which is not what I want to show that it is an action. So what am I doing wrong? Can someone explain to be how to show the ""in other words"" part? Thank you.","['group-actions', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
