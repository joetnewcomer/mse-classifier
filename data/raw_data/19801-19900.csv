165833,Question About Concave Functions,"It easy to prove that no non-constant positive concave function exists (for example by integrating: $ u'' \leq 0 \to u' \leq c \to u \leq cx+c_2 $ and since $u>0$ , we obviously get a contradiction.

165835,Spectrum of a real number,"Whilst reading Concrete Mathematics , the authors mention something which they refer to as the ""spectrum"" of a real number (pg. 77): We define the spectrum of a real number $\alpha$ to be an infinite multiset of integers, $$\operatorname{Spec}{(\alpha)}=\{\left\lfloor\alpha\right\rfloor, \left\lfloor2\alpha\right\rfloor,\left\lfloor3\alpha\right\rfloor,\cdots\}.$$ It then goes on to describe interesting properties of these ""spectra"", such as the inequality of any two spectra, i.e. given some $\alpha\in\mathbb{R},\space\not\exists\beta\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{\alpha\}:\operatorname{Spec}{(\alpha)}=\operatorname{Spec}{(\beta)}$. It also gives a proof regarding the partitioning of the set $\mathbb{N}$ into two spectra, $\operatorname{Spec}{(\sqrt{2})}$ and $\operatorname{Spec}{(\sqrt{2}+2)}$. These properties intrigued me, so I wondered if there were any other properties of these multisets, however; a google search for ""spectrum of a real number"" doesn't appear to yield any relevant results, so I wondered if there was any research into these objects, and if there is whether ""spectrum"" is a non-standard name (if it is, I'd appreciate the common name for these objects).

165842,Angle between GPS coordinates,"I realize GPS Coordinates are spherical coordinates. However I know the earth is more of an ellipsoid. I need to compute with a fairly high degree of accuracy the pitch and yaw between two objects whose coordinates are expressed in Longitude,Latitude and Altitude. By ""pitch"" I mean relative to true north, how many degrees does something at point A have to turn to face point B
By ""yaw"" I mean relative to the ground how many degrees do I have to tilt to face the object in question. Facing the ground could be 0 degrees, the horizon 90 degrees and the sky 180 degrees for example. There are a few answers that start to approach this but nothing I can tell quite answers it. To determine pitch/yaw you have to realize its relative to something sitting on the outside of the ellipsoid at one of the two points. Simply using |A||B|cos(theta)=A dot b doesn't work because that gives the angle between them from the perspective of the center of the earth. Also that assumes you converted gps coordinates to XYZ first. (Which is done easily enough)","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'spherical-geometry', 'spherical-coordinates']"
165843,Ranking probability task,"Local football association has $10$ teams. Team A has $40\%$ chance to score a win in the game against better ranking opponent, and $75\%$ against worse ranking opponent. If team A is currently $4$-th on the ranking list, define probability that A will win in the next game. So I have done the following here
$0.4 \cdot 0.3$ ($3$ out of $10$ are better ranking opponents)+ $0.75 \cdot 0.6$ ($6$ are worse ranking opponents) = $\frac{1}{12} + \frac{3}{24} = \frac{5}{24}$. I am not sure whether or not this is correct, but I plead you to elaborate this claim of mine.","['statistics', 'probability']"

From what I can glean, a similarity transformation represents a change of basis from one orthogonal basis in $\mathbf{R}^n$ to another. My understanding is that a congruence transformation is an isometry, and so, it seems it would represent some geometrical operation like a (rigid) rotation, reflection, etc which preserves angles ad distances (but not necessarily orientation).

Added: In light of drak's suggestion, here is a bit more Some thoughts: It might be friendlier to change ""variables"" to $A\sigma$? Is there a more familiar expression for the index notation ${\partial \over \partial v_j}M_{ij}(v)$ such as one in  terms of $\nabla$? It would seem to me that it is taking the divergence of each row of the matrix $M$. Some more thoughts: since the function $\sigma$ appears on both sides of the equation, it is likely that it is an exponential.

Corollary :  Let $G$ be a finite group, and $p$ be a prime.  Then $G$ is a $p$-group if and only if the order of $G$ is a power of $p$. Relevant Definition :  $G$ is a $p$-group (for a prime $p$) if every element of $G$ has order $p^m$ for some $m\geq 1$. The proof of the theorem was a beautiful application of using group actions to count.

165930,Derivative of a particular matrix valued function with respect to a vector,"I am reading a section of a book regarding linear regression and came across a derivation that I could not follow.

So then I tried looking at the quotient field $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/x^3 + x + 1$ to see if I would get lucky and it would contain all three roots but it doesn't.  Is there a clever way to easily find this splitting field besides using the cubic formula to find the roots and then just directly adjoining them to $\mathbb{Z}_2$?

165996,Is there a purely algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra?,"Among the many techniques available at our disposal to prove FTA, is there any purely algebraic proof of the theorem? That seems reasonably unexpected, because somehow or the other we are depending on the topological nature of $R$, and Wikipedia supports  the claim in these statements: ""In spite of its name, there is no purely algebraic proof of the theorem, since any proof must use the completeness of the reals (or some other equivalent formulation of completeness), which is not an algebraic concept."" Is it a proven fact that no pure algebraic proof is possible? And so if I assume we are relying on the topological properties of $R$ and $C$ to prove the theorem, then given any arbitrary field how can one test whether it is algebraically closed or not? Again in Wikipedia I found this result stated, ""The classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Categoricity does not say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the complex numbers C are the same as C; it only asserts that they are isomorphic as fields to C. It follows that although the completed p-adic closures Cp are all isomorphic as fields to C, they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties."" so i now want to rephrase my question as, given any field with different topological properties than C and which is in no simple way isomorphic to $C$ how can we generalize the proof of FTA to check whether FTA is valid on those fields? And what about characteristic p fields? i can see an example that algebraic closure of $F_p((t))$ is an example of infinite, characteristic p field that is by construction closed, but if we had in our arsenal other ways to describe the field and suppress the fact that it is algebraic closure of another field then how can one prove that it is algebraically closed?

Clearly, the singularity lies outside the contour: However, recall Cauchy's Residue Theorem : If $\Gamma$ is a simple closed positively oriented contour and $f$ is analytic inside and on $\Gamma$ except at the points $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_n$, then
  $$\int_\Gamma f(z)dz=2\pi i\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Res}(z_j),$$

  $$\text{Res}(f;z_0)=\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{1}{(m-1)!}\frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}}[(z-z_0)^mf(z)].$$ If I use this to evaluate the integral, I will have that $$\text{Res}(f;\pi)=\lim_{z\to\pi}\frac{d}{dz}[\cos z]=0,$$and hence the value of the integral will evaluate to $0$, which is the correct answer.

Multiplying both sides of the recurrence by $X^k$ and summing over all valid $k$ gives $$\sum_{k\geq 1}a_{k+1}X^k=\sum_{k\geq 1}a_kX^k+\sum_{k\geq 1}kX^k.$$ Using the fact that $\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}=\sum_{k\geq 1} kX^k$, I get $$\sum_{k\geq 1}a_{k+1}X^k=G(X)+\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}.$$ The left hand side is equal to $$\frac{G(X)-a_1}{X}=\frac{G(X)-2}{X}$$ since $a_1=2$. Solving for $G(X)$, I get $$G(X)=\frac{2-4X+3x^2}{(1-x)^3}.$$ Expanding with partial fractions gives $$G(X)=\frac{3}{1-x}-\frac{2}{(1-x)^2}+\frac{1}{(1-x)^3}.$$ Transforming this into power series gives \begin{align}
G(X)&=3\sum_{k\geq 0}X^k-2\sum_{k\geq 0} (k+1)X^k+\sum_{k\geq 0}(k+1)(k+2)X^k\\
&=\sum_{k\geq 0} (3-2(k+1)+(k+1)(k+2))X^k,
\end{align}
which is not correct. I have tried starting over, but I seems to be making a pretty serious mistake. Any thoughts? Solution : The real recurrence relation is $a_{n+1}=a_n+(n+1)$. Let $G(X)=\sum_{k\geq 1} a_k X^k$. Multiplying both sides of the recurrence by $X^k$ and summing over all valid $k$ gives $$\sum_{k\geq 1}a_{k+1}X^k=\sum_{k\geq 1}a_kX^k+\sum_{k\geq 1}(k+1)X^k.$$ Solving in terms of $G(X)$ gives $$G(X)=\frac{x(2-2x+x^2)}{(1-x)^3}.$$ By expanding with partial fractions we see $$G(X)=\frac{x(2-2x+x^2)}{(1-x)^3}=\frac{x}{1-x}+\frac{x}{(1-x)^3}.$$ Using the power series identities $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k\geq 1}k(k-1)X^{k-1}=\frac{x}{(1-x)^3}$ and $\sum_{k\geq 1}X^k=\frac{x}{1-x}$. Substituting these power series in gives \begin{align}
G(X)&=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k\geq 1}k(k-1)X^{k-1}+\sum_{k\geq 1}X^k\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k\geq 1}k(k+1)X^{k}+\sum_{k\geq 1}X^k \quad \dagger\\
&=\sum_{n\geq 1} (\binom{k+1}{2}+1)X^k.
\end{align} Therefore, by equating coefficients, we have $$a_n=\binom{n+1}{2}+1.$$ The step $\dagger$ follows from the fact that the first coefficient in the power series is $0$. Note: This is NOT homework, I am merely working through exercises during summer vacation. I'm sure there are other ways to approach the problem, but I am trying to practice using generating functions.","['generating-functions', 'combinatorics']"

166321,"Does this intuition for ""calculus-ish"" continuity generalize to topological continuity?","In the past, I've always motivated continuity of a function from (some subset of) $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R$ based on the (incomplete) definition $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$; continuity at isolated points was never really too hard to explain. The main tool behind my explanation is a ""using your common sense, what should the value here be?"" prompt. My usual example is this: You have a video camera, you're taking a video of the projectile motion of a ball or something. At precisely 3 minutes, your battery dies. Your camera is so awesome that it records stuff up to 2.999...[however many (finitely many) 9's] minutes. Common sense, i.e. ""how the real world works"", should tell you that this is enough for you to find out where the ball is at 3 minutes, even without any footage at that specific instant. If it were just a little bit higher/lower than ""the right answer"", then the ball would have to magically teleport from one point to another in [snaps fingers], which doesn't make any sense. Then I get to the punchline - that continuity is required for us to ""predict"" things within ""reasonable expectations"". Things don't magically jump/teleport from one point to another, neither does temperature, brightness, etc. At isolated points, there's not enough ""surrounding data"" for us to make predictions, so any value can potentially be ""reasonable"", because if you claim that my prediction is ""too high/low"", I can always argue that it's conceivable that there might be a spike/dip in the surrounding data, so who's to say my prediction is definitely wrong? (If this is a bad explanation, please let me know how I can improve it.) Fast-forward to a rather different scenario, now I'm trying to explain that the product topology is the coarsest topology that makes all projections continuous. I got countered with ""but why should all projections be continuous?"" I was stumped. I'd never really thought about the intuition behind continuity outside of $\mathbb R$. So my question is, can I generalize this ""prediction"" thing to motivate why projections of a product space onto its factor spaces should always be continuous? If so, how? If not, why not? I have read the answers here , but I think/hope my question is a little different. Also, feel free to yell at me if I've gotten continuity wrong for the last few years (and poisoned the minds of many others). But I would appreciate it if you could follow up with suggestions.

I proved it in the following way and I'd like to know whether it's a valid proof or not. I'd also like to know about other proofs (I'm sure there are...) : We use induction on $n$. Let's assume the proposition for $n-1$. Let $\phi: \mathbb{E}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{E}^n$ be an isometry $\neq id$, and $\{e_1,\ldots, e_n\}$ be the canonical basis of $\mathbb{E}^n$. Consider the reflection $\sigma$ about the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector $e_1-\phi(e_1)$, which we assume non-zero, without loss of generality since $\phi\neq id$. Clearly $\sigma(e_1)=\phi(e_1)$, so $e_1$ is ok. Since $\{\phi(e_2),\ldots, \phi(e_n)\}$ and $\{\sigma(e_2),\ldots, \sigma(e_n)\}$ are orthormal bases of the subspace $\langle \sigma(e_1)\rangle ^{\perp}$, there is an isometry $\psi: \mathbb{E}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{E}^n$ such that $\psi(\sigma(e_1))=\sigma(e_1)$ and $\psi(\sigma(e_j))=\phi(e_j)$, ($j\neq 1$). Since $\psi$ induces an isometry on $\langle \sigma(e_1)\rangle ^{\perp}$, by the inductive hypothesis, it can be written as a product of reflections about subspaces of $\langle \sigma(e_1)\rangle ^{\perp}$ and dimension $n-2$. Each of these subspaces can be extended to an hyperplane of $\mathbb{E}^n$ so that $\sigma(e_1)$ belongs to that and hence remains unchanged under those reflections. $\square$","['geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

I can get very close with a simple argument: if $p \ne q$ and $\frac{\log{p}}{\log{q}} = \frac{a}{b}$, then because $q^\frac{\log{p}}{\log{q}} = p$, $q^a = p^b$, but this is impossible by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.  So the ratio of the logarithms of any two primes is irrational.  Now, if $\log{p}$ is rational, then since $\frac{\log{p}}{\log{q}}$ is irrational, $\log{q}$ is also irrational.  So, I can conclude that at most one prime has a rational logarithm. I realize that the rest follows from the transcendence of $e$, but that proof is relatively complex, and all that's left to show is that no integer power of $e$ is a prime power (because if $\log p$ is rational, then $e^a = p^b$ has a solution).  It is easy to prove that $e$ is irrational ($e = \frac{a}{b!} = \sum{\frac{1}{n!}}$, multiply by $b!$ and separate the sum into integer and fractional parts) but I can't figure out how to generalize this simple proof to show that $e^x$ is irrational for all integer $x$; it introduces a $x^n$ term to the sum and the integer and fractional parts can no longer be separated.

Right below it is Lindeberg condition for Lindeberg CLT, which makes me wonder if the ""name-unknown condition"" in Greene's Theorem D.19 is a typo?) Here is an example from Robert Isreal's earlier reply, which seems to indicate something might be wrong in the second one, i.e. the Greene's.
Let $X_i$ be independent with $$P(X_i = 2^i) = P(X_i = -2^i) = 2^{-2i-1}, P(X_i = 0) = 1 - 2^{-2i}.$$  Thus $\mu_i = 0$ and $\sigma_i^2 = 1$. Since $$P(S_n = 0) > P(X_i = 0 \text{ for all }i) > 1 -
\sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{-2i} = 2/3,$$ it shows directly that $S_n/s_n$
does not go to $N(0,1)$ in distribution. A normal distribution has
$P(Z=0)=0$. The Lindeberg condition in Wikipedia's is not satisfied by the example (take $ϵ=1$ for
example). So it is not conclusive that $S_n/s_n$ should or should not converge to
$N(0,1)$ in distribution. The two conditions in Greene's are satisfied, since $s_n^2 = n$. So
$S_n/s_n$ should converges to $N(0,1)$ in distribution. So the result from Greene's is not consistent with the results from other ways. I wonder what has gone wrong? Thanks!",['probability-theory']

$$|u(x,y)|=|\int_{K(0,1)}G(x,y,x',y')f(x',y')~dx'~dy'|\leq \sup_{K(0,1)}|f|\int_{K(0,1)}|G(x,y,x',y')|~dx'~dy'.$$ But now I have a problem. How to get rid of the absolute value inside the integral. Because, if it were not there, then $$\int_{K(0,1)}G(x,y,x',y')~dx'~dy'=\frac{x^2+y^2-1}{4},$$ which is the unique solution to the problem:
$$\Delta u=1,  \ \mbox{on}  \ K(0,1),$$
$$u(x,y)=0 \text{ the boundary of } K(0,1).$$
Then it is easy to establish, that $|\frac{x^2+y^2-1}{4}|\leq \frac{1}{4}$ on $K(0,1).$ Can someone please tell me how to write a fully correct solution to this problem.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

  the item will increase its value to 2x its original value. Your bid
  can only go through if its at least as large as the original value of
  the item. How do you bid to maximize expected payoff. Here's what I have: Let V be the true value of the item Let B be the bid you make Let f(V) represent the profit you make given V as the true original value $$f(V) = 
     \begin{cases}
       2V - B & B \geq V\\

EDIT: Here is the solution from the book I'm working off of. I do not understand how they are doing the calculus. Let B be your bid. Let S be the true value of the item. The density function of S equals unity for $0 \leq S \leq 1$, and 0 otherwise. Your payoff P is $$P(S) =
\begin{cases}
  2S - B & B \geq S\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$ The maximum post bid item value is 2, so you should be no more than 2. You want to maximize $E[P(S)]$ with respect to choice of B in the interval [0, 2]. Your expected payoff is: $$\begin{aligned}
E[P(S)] &=  \int_{S=0}^{S=1} P(S)*1*\,\mathrm{d}S \\
 &=  \int_{S=0}^{S=\min(B,1)} (2S-B)\,\mathrm{d} \\

     \begin{cases}
       0 &  B\leq1\\

I'd really like your help with understanding how to solve this Cauchy problem:  $(t^2+1)(y''-2y+1)=e^t$ with the initial conditions: $y(0)=y'(0)=1$. I see a lot of methods and I am completely confused about what are the steps for solving this equation. First I wrote $$(y''-2y+1)=\frac{e^t}{(t^2+1)}.$$ I read that I need to solve first the homogeneous equation $(y''-2y+1)=0$. Do I use Abel to reduce the order of the equation? I know that I need particular solution, so $y=0.5$ would do. Now as far as I understand I need to use Wronskian determinant $$\begin{vmatrix}
0.5 &y \\ 
0 &y' 
\end{vmatrix}=c\cdot e^{\int^t_0-(2)/1 ds}=c\cdot e^{-2t}=0.5y'$$ so $y'=2ce^{-2t}$, here I can use the data given me in the beginning so $c=0.5$ and $y'=e^{-2t}$ and $y=-0.5e^{-2t}+d$ and from the initial data again $d=1.5$ and $y=-0.5e^{-2t}+1.5$. so now $y_h=-0.5e^{-2t}+1.5$ now I need to find $y_p=-0.5e^{-2t}u_1(t)+1.5u_2(t)$. Then, I wrote the floowing :$$\begin{bmatrix}
-0.5e^{-2t} &1.5 \\ 
 e^{-2t}& 0
\end{bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
u_1'\\ 
u_2'
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 
\frac{e^t}{(t^2+1)}
\end{pmatrix}.$$ By using this system, I found $u_1$ and $u_2$ and the final solution is $y_=y_h+y_p$. Please tell me- am I right? Is this basically the way to do that? Was I allowed to divide the original solution with $(t^2+1)$ or should I had to solve  $(t^2+1)(y''-2y+1)$ as a homogeneous equation?

166854,"Find a single-valued analytic branch of $\sqrt{z^2-1}$ in $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1,1]$.","I have the following question: Show there is a single-valued analytic branch $f(z)$ for $\sqrt{z^2-1}$ in $\mathbb{C}\backslash [-1,1]$ such that $f(x) < 0$ for $x>1$. Here $[-1,1]$ denotes a closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$. The following solution mimics a derivation from Moore and Hadlock's text. Note that $z^2-1 = (z-1)(z+1)$. Consider the following four functions:
\begin{align*} 
w_1(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) \in [0,2\pi) \\
w_2(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_1}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_1}(z+1) \in [0, 2\pi) \\
w_3(z) &= \sqrt{|z-1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) \in [-\pi,\pi) \\
w_4(z) &= \sqrt{|z+1|} e^{(i\operatorname{arg_2}(z+1))/2}  &\text{ where } \operatorname{arg_2}(z+1) \in [-\pi, \pi) 
\end{align*} 
Note that $w_1$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [1, \infty)$; $w_2$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq 0\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$; $w_3$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z-1) \neq \pi\} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$; and $w_4$ is analytic on the set $\{ z \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \neq \pi \} = \mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, -1]$. Therefore $w_1w_2$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$ and $w_3w_4$ is analytic on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$. Furthermore, on the set $\mathbb{C} \backslash (-\infty, 1]$, we have $w_1w_2 = w_3w_4$, as we see below: If $x > 1$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(x \pm 1) = \operatorname{arg_2}(x \pm 1) = 0$, and thus 
$$w_1w_2(x)= w_3w_4(x) = \sqrt{x^2-1} \cdot e^{i \cdot 0} = \sqrt{x^2-1}.  $$ If $\operatorname{Im}(z) > 0$, then $w_1w_2(z) = w_3w_4(z)$ since $\operatorname{arg}(z-1), \operatorname{arg}(z+1) \in (0, \pi)$. If $\operatorname{Im}(z) < 0$, then $\operatorname{arg_1}(z\pm 1) = 2\pi + \operatorname{arg_2}(z\pm 1)$. Then 
$$w_1w_2(z) = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_1}(z-1))/2} = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2 + 2\pi i } $$
$$ = \sqrt{|z^2-1|} e^{i(\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1) +\operatorname{arg_2}(z-1))/2} = w_3w_4(z).$$ This implies that $w_1w_2$ is analytic not only on $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, \infty)$, but on the larger set $\mathbb{C} \backslash [-1, 1]$. This is a single-valued analytic branch of $\sqrt{z^2-1}$. However, for $x >1$, we have $w_1w_2(x) >0$. To address this, multiply $w_1w_2$ by $e^{i\pi}$. The resulting function is a single-valued analytic branch with the desired property. I understand the computations here, but I'm trying to grasp the motivation behind the definitions, and see how it might generalize.

I'm independently going through Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 3rd Edition, by Raymond A. Serway, Chapter 3, problem 80, which, to paraphrase the problem, goes like this: A boy scout ties a rope to his food, throws the rope over a branch, and starts walking at a constant velocity $v_0$ and the food starts going straight up. The food starts at the level of his hands and at a height $h$ above that is the branch. The distance he is away from the vertical rope at any given time is $x$. (Here's my drawing of the situation below, the book has a fancier picture of a real human and a tree, but I've stripped it down to the essentials). The problem goes on to say: (a) Prove that the food's velocity $v$ when the boy's position is $x$ is equal to: $$v = v_0 \cdot x \cdot (h^2 + x^2)^{-1/2}.$$ (b) Prove that the food's acceleration a when the boy's position is $x$ is equal to: $$a = v_0^2 \cdot h^2 \cdot (h^2 + x^2)^{-3/2}.$$ I can solve part (a) by drawing a triangle down by the boy's hands as shown and understanding that the food's velocity wraps around the branch in the direction along $l$, and $v_0$ is then the hypotenuse, so $v$ is $v_0 \sin \theta$, which $\sin \theta$ is then equivalent to $x / (h^2 + x^2)^{1/2}$, so $v$ is $v_0 \cdot x \cdot (h^2 + x^2)^{-1/2}$, which is the answer. I can also see that a is the time derivative of $v$. I can imagine using the chain rule to say that $a = dv/dt = dv/d \theta \cdot d \theta /dx \cdot dx/dt$.

I'm not sure how correct I am and wanted to know if I did them correct? Could someone help with the last one I just cant figure out how to start that expression? $∀ x\ P(x) = P(-2) ∧ P(-1) ∧ P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ P(2)$ $\neg ∀x\ P(x) = (P(−2)∨P(−1)∨P(0)∨P(1)∨P(2))∧¬(P(−2)∧P(−1)∧P(0)∧P(1)∧P(2)) In English doesn't that mean: At least one element is true and one element is false? $∃x\ \neg P(x) = $ Edit: The last two with the correct answer of ""At least one is not true"". ∃x￢P(x) = ￢P(-2) ∨￢P(-1) ∨￢P(0) ∨￢P(1) ∨￢P(2) ￢∀xP(x) = ￢(P(-2) ∧ P(-1) ∧ P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ P(2))","['propositional-calculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"
167113,The role of maps in algebraic structures?,"In group theory we have encountered the concepts of homomorphisms as maps from one group to another, and the same thing with ring and field theory and we ave called them respectively homomorphisms of groups (of rings, and of fields). Also in linear algebra we have linear maps.
So my question is this:
What is the role of such maps in this algebraic structures?","['morphism', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
167146,"How to explain what it means to say a function is ""defined"" on an interval?","I am having difficulty in explaining the terminology ""defined"" to the students I am assisting. Here is the sentence: If a real-valued function $f$ is defined and continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ in the real line, then $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$. Can I have some thoughts on how to explain the word ""defined"" used in the sentence? Thank you.","['calculus', 'terminology']"
167155,The sum: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}=\ln(2)$ using Riemann Integral and other methods,"I need to prove the following: $$1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+(-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}+\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}=\ln(2)$$ Method 1: The series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}$ is an alternating series, thus it is convergent, say to $l$ . Therefore, both $s_{2n}$ and $s_n$ are convergent to the same limit $l$ . $$
\begin{align}
s_{2n}=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots-\frac{1}{2n} & =\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}\right)-2\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}\right) \\[10pt]
& =\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n}
\end{align}
$$ It is an easy exercise to prove that $$\lim_{n \to \infty }s_{2n}=\lim_{n \to \infty }s_n =\lim_{n \to \infty }\left [ \frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n} \right ]=\ln(2)$$ which implies that the given alternating series converges to $l=\ln 2$ . However, I am interested to see proof of this problem using the definition of the Riemann Integral as a sum of infinitely many rectangles of widths tending to zero. I tried to come up with proof for this, but I couldn't. Can anyone share, please? Also, I am interested to see other methods of solving this problem (other than my method and the Riemann method.) If anyone of you is aware of any other methods, please share.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
