1314700,Order of group elements from a character table,"Most questions that I can find on here (or anywhere else on the internet) deal with constructing a character table given a description of the group.

I've had a look in Representations and Characters of Groups by James & Liebeck, but I can't find anything that (at a first glance) seems particularly geared towards answering this kind of question.

1315071,Are the rules of this tournament fair?,"My daughter just took part to a volleyball tournament and she wonders whether the rules of the tournament were fair or not. There are 10 teams, gathered into 3 groups: Group 1 with 4 teams and Groups 2 and 3 with 3 teams. Each team plays a match against each other team in the same group. The result of each match being either 2-0 or 2-1, 1-2 or 0-2 (there is no tie in volleyball), it gives each team either 2, 1, -1 or -2 points for the tournament ranking. After this first series of matches, the teams are redistributed into three new groups as follows: Group A (4 teams: the three winners of each group and the best among the seconds of the three groups), Group B (3 teams: the remaining seconds of each group and the best among the thirds of groups 1, 2 and 3), Group C (the remaining 3 teams). The key rule explains how to decide which team is best second (respectively best third). The rule consists to add the points obtained by each team and to divide it by the number of matches. For instance, if a team of Group 1 won the first match by 2-1, won the second one by 2-0 and lost the third one by 1-2, this team would get a score of $(1 + 2 - 1)/3 = 2/3$. In case of tie, the total number of points scored in each set can be used. Question . My daughter had the feeling that the teams in Group 1 (the one with 4 teams) had a slight advantage to end up being in either Group A or Group B. Is this feeling justified? In a more mathematical setting, assuming that the results of the matches are randomly distributed with equal probability 1/4 for each score $(-2, -1, 1, 2)$, what is the probability for a team of Group 1 (respectively 2 or 3) to end up in Group A (respectively B and C)? Although my daugther is mainly interested in the case of 10 teams divided into 3 groups, a mathematical argument for the case of $n$ teams divided into $r$ groups would be appreciated.","['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1315080,Show that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\cong U$ where $U=\{z\in \mathbb{C}\mid |z|=1\}$,"Consider that $\mathbb{R}$ is a group under addition and $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$. Show that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\cong U$ where $U=\{z\in \mathbb{C}\mid |z|=1\}$ Consider the function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ given by $f(x)=e^{2\pi xi}$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is a additive group, then the additive identity $0\in \mathbb{R}$, so $f(0)=e^{2\pi 0i}=e^0=1\in \mathbb{C}$ which show $f(x)$ is not a trival function. Let $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$, then $f(a)=e^{2\pi ai}$ and $f(b)=e^{2\pi bi}$, so $f(a+b)=e^{2\pi (a+b)i}=e^{2\pi (ai+bi)}=e^{2\pi ai}e^{2\pi bi}=f(a)f(b)$. Hence, $f(x)$ is a homomorphism. Because $\mathbb{R}$ is an additive group,$\ker(f(x))=\{0\}$, by the first isomorphic theorem, $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\cong U$. Is that right?

$ Edit : Ignoring the ""one box can be empty""-condition and if all objects are distinct, this is solved with the Stirling number of 2 nd kind $\lbrace{n\atop k}\rbrace$.
But since some objects are distinguishable ($\circ,\bullet$) and some are not ($\circ,\circ$) I do not know if this is a real lead. Edit : Users on the chat indicated me that this problem is similar to counting orbits of a group of actions , counting partitions of a multiset and prime factorization . Edit : This answer provides a working result using the Polya Enumeration Theorem although it is far from computable for high values $(2)$.
Let $n=\prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{a_i}$, $r$ being the number of type of balls (colors), $p_i$ some unique prime (different for each type) and $a_i$ the number of balls of this type. Then the given function $G(n,k)$ is my answer. Edit : Following the idea that this is similar to a factorization problem, this paper may be of use. This function gives the number of unordered factorizations with distinct parts and largest  part at  most $m$ : $$g(m,n)=\sum_{\substack{d|n \\ d\leq m}} g(d,n/d)$$
with $g(m,1)=1$ and $g(1,n)=0$ for $n\neq 1$. And then $f(n)=g(n,n)$ gives the total number of unordered factorizations with distinct parts. For $\{\circ,\circ,\circ,\circ,\bullet,\bullet\}$, it gives us $f(2^4 \times 3^2)=14$ factorizations. It might be possible to adapt the previous formula to keep only the factorizations of $k$ or $k-1$ integers. Edit : The desired function is called $P_d(k,n)$ in this paper . Although they don't have a formula for it, they state that $H_d(n)=\sum_k k! P_d(k,n)$ where $H_d(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\log_2 n \rfloor} H_d'(k,n)$ is the total number of distinct ordered factorizations and 
$$H_d'(k+1,n) = k! \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(-1)^j}{(k-1-j)!} \sum H_d \left(k-j,\frac{n}{d}\right)$$
where the inside sum is taken over all $d$ such that $d|n$ and for $d\geq 2$, $d$ is a $(j+1)$-st power is the number of ordered factorizations of $n$ into $k$ distinct parts. $(1)$ This condition could be ignored since we can sum the number of combinations for $k$ and $k-1$. $(2)$ I am working with $k\approx50$, $r\approx1000$ and $a\in[1;10000]$.","['multisets', 'prime-factorization', 'combinatorics']"

1315172,Advanced / In-Depth Calculus Book for Self-Edification,"I am a pre-engineering student currently taking a Single Variable Calculus course at a community college. I recognize that my future success (or not so much) as an engineer will be based, in large part, on my capabilities with and understanding of Calculus. Therefore, I really, really want to master it like I've never mastered any subject before. I'm doing well in my class, and my instructor is great, but I am under the impression that this course and it's textbook ( Calculus, Early Transcendentals by Stewart ) do not delve quite as deeply into Calculus as I would like. Also, the textbook frequently introduces new techniques and concepts with little to no explanation.

So I'm hoping to find some really excellent Calculus textbooks that will give me deep insight into the topics of differentiation and integration (and any other topics my course may be missing). I've used Google and my school's library to search extensively, and I've found no shortage of Calculus textbooks.

1315175,Differentiation always easy?,"There are many examples of real functions admitting antiderivatives (since e.g. continuous), but where computing a concrete antiderivative is a seriously hard problem even if an elementary one exists. What about differentiation? My experience is that the basic rules of calculus along with term-by-term differentiantion of power series make differentiation a just-do-it kind of problem for virtually all everyday kinds of functions. In fact, if we add the limit exchange trick for uniformly convergent sequence of derivatives, I cannot think of any examples, where finding a closed form for $f'$, given a closed form for $f$, is not a mechanical task. So the question is: are there any examples of real functions $f$, such that (1) $f$ is given in ""nice"" closed form $f(x)=\ldots$ (2) it is ""relatively easy"" to justify that $f$ is differentiable (3) computing the derivative of $f$ is actually hard.

  the set C = { x ∈ ℝ | x > 7 }? Solution: Clearly 7 ≤ x for every x $\in$ B, so ∀x $\in$ B(7Lx) and therefore 7
  is a smallest element of B. It is also a minimal element, since
  nothing in B is smaller than 7, so ¬∃x ∈ B(x ≤ 7 ∧ x $\neq$ 7). There are
  no other smallest or minimal elements. Note that 7 is not a smallest
  or minimal element of C, since 7 $\not\in$ C . According to Definition 4.4.4 , a smallest or minimal element of a set must actually be an element of the set. In fact, C has no smallest or
  minimal elements. The part about B makes perfect sense to me, but I'm confused about: In fact, C has no smallest or minimal elements As far as my understanding goes, C does have an L-smallest element, which happens to be 8 (the example says that 7 is not a smallest/minimal element of C, which is obvious since 7 is not a member of C): $$\forall x \in C(8Lx)$$ Which is obviously true since 8 ≤ 8, 8 ≤ 9, 8 ≤ 10, and so on. Also, 8 looks like an L-minimal element of C as well, since: $$\lnot \exists x \in C(xL8 \land x \neq 8)$$ The only element of C which is smaller or equal to 8 is 8, but 8 = 8.

1315243,Interior Derivative and Contraction: Kobayashi and Nomizu.,"In Kobayashi & Nomizu, the interior derivative of an r-form is defined as $\iota_X \omega = C(X \otimes \omega)$, where $C$ is the contraction associated with the pair $(1,1)$ and $\omega$ is interpreted as a tensor of type $(0,r)$. They then claim that
\begin{equation*}
(\iota_X)(Y_1, \dots, Y_{r-1}) = r \; \omega(X, Y_1, \dots, Y_{r-1})
\end{equation*}
My question is: where does the factor of $r$ come from? This seems to be inconsistent with their previous conventions for forms. Since they define $\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2 = \frac{1}{2}(\omega_1 \otimes \omega_2  - \omega_2 \otimes \omega_1)$, we should have
\begin{equation*}
C(X \otimes (\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2))(Y) = \frac{1}{2}( \omega_1(X) \omega_2(Y) - \omega_2(X) \omega_1(Y))
\end{equation*}
whereas, using the determinant convention in K&N, given by
\begin{equation*}
\omega_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \omega_n = \frac{1}{n!} \det(\omega_i(X_j))
\end{equation*}
we have
\begin{equation*}
2 (\omega_1 \wedge \omega_2)(X,Y) = 2 \frac{1}{2} (\omega_1(X) \omega_2(Y) - \omega_2(X) \omega_1(Y))

For all $x, y \in X$ , we have $p(x+y) \leq p(x) + p(y)$ . And, $p(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in X$ such that $\Vert x \Vert > r$ , where $r$ is a given positive real number. Let $v \in X$ be arbitrary. Let $v$ be non-zero. Let $$x \colon =  \frac{r+1}{\Vert v \Vert  }  v.$$ Then $\Vert x \Vert = r+1$ . So we must have $p(x) \geq 0$ . What next? PS: Here is a solution: First, we show that $$ n p(x) \geq p(nx) \ \mbox{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N}. \tag{0} $$ For $n = 1$ , this holds trivially. So if this holds for any given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , then we find that $$ (n+1)p(x) = np(x) + p(x) \geq p(nx) + p(x) \geq p(nx+x) = p\big( (n+1) x \big). $$ Hence (0) holds for all natural numbers $n$ . We are given that, there is a (non-negative) real number $r$ such that $$ p(x) \geq 0 \ \mbox{ for all } x \in X \mbox{ such that } \lVert x \rVert > r. \tag{1} $$ Let $x \in X$ such that $\lVert x \rVert \leq r$ . There are two cases according as $\lVert x \rVert > 0$ or $\lVert x \rVert = 0$ . Case 1: If $\lVert x \rVert > 0$ , then let us choose a natural number $n$ such that $$ \lVert nx \rVert = n \lVert x \rVert > r. $$ This along with (0) amd (1) above yields $$ n p(x) \geq p(nx) \geq 0, $$ and as $n > 0$ , so we obtain $$ p(x) \geq 0. $$ Before considering the case $\lVert x \rVert = 0$ , we note that, for any $x, y \in X$ , we have $$ p(x) = p(x - y + y) \leq p(x-y) + p(y), $$ and so $$ p(x) - p(y) \leq p(x-y),   $$ which is the same as $$ p(x-y) \geq p(x) - p(y). \tag{2} $$ Case 2: If $\lVert x \rVert = 0$ , then $x = \mathbf{0}_X$ , the zero vector in $X$ . In this case we use (2) above and find that, for any $x \in X$ , $$ p\left( \mathbf{0}_X \right) = p\big(x - x \big) \geq p(x) - p(x) = 0, $$ and so $$  p\left( \mathbf{0}_X \right) \geq 0, $$ as required.

I don't have much clue here - as usual I started off to find $\dfrac {dy}{dx}$ of the parametric equation = $\dfrac 1 t$ So the normal grad is $-t$ and it passes through $(p, 0)$. Or we have two parallel lines consisting of 
$$y=\dfrac 1 t x - \dfrac 1 t p$$
$$y=\dfrac 1 t x - at$$ and find the shortest distance between them.
I know 
$$-t = \dfrac {-2at}{p -at^2} $$ and I tried to find t in terms of p and a,
But the distance between them using the equation
$$d = \dfrac{\left| d2-d1 \right|}{\sqrt {m^2 + 1}}$$
Gets really messy and does not seem to give what the solution paper says: Shortest distance is $p$ if $p < 2$ and is $2\sqrt{a(p-a)}$ if $\dfrac p a \geq 2$. Is there a quick way of doing this? Further, in the previous part of this question The line $L$ has equation $y=mx+c$, where $m>0$ and $c>0$. Show that, in the case $mc>a>0$, the shortest distance between L and the parabola $y^2 = 4ax$
  $$\dfrac {mc-a}{m\sqrt{m^2 +1}}$$ I solved it using that $d$ equation I found from the Wikipedia. It is not given in the formula book so I think I am supposed to find an alternative way of solving it. (Or derive it on my own) Equating two normal equations and comparing it to the original equation gives a point $(\dfrac a {m^2}, \dfrac {2a} {m})$ nNw $$d = \sqrt {(\dfrac a {m^2} - x)^2+{(\dfrac {2a} {m} - (mx +c)})^2}$$ Differentiating to find the maximum value gives :
$$=> x = \dfrac {c-\dfrac {2a}{m} - \dfrac {a}{m^2}}{m+1}$$ Again it becomes very messy when I put this $x$ back in to the equation to find $d$. Is there a better way of doing this?

This is equivalent to asking if exactly $n^2-n+1$ of the elements must be zero. There is some reason to think so - if you have less than $n$ nonzero elements, some row has all $0$ s and the determinant is $0$ for every matrix, while if you have exactly $n$ nonzero elements, then the diagonal matrix will always have nonzero determinant. However, perhaps it is possible to have zero determinant for every arrangement if we have more nonzero elements (though this appears unreasonable).

1316438,Bounds of the derivatives of the mollifier function,"The standard mollifier function is defined as follows $$f(x)=\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } |x| \ge 1\\ \exp \left(-\cfrac{1}{1-x^2}\right) & \text{if } |x|<1.\end{cases}$$ It is well known that $f$ is $C^\infty$ , and $f^{(n)}(x)=0$ for $|x| \ge 1$ . On the interval $x\in (-1,1)$ , the derivative $$\displaystyle f^{(n)}(x)=\frac{P_n(x)}{(1-x^2)^{2n}}\cdot f(x)$$ where $P_n$ is a polynomial function of $x$ defined inductively by $$P_0(x) \equiv 1, \qquad P_1(x)=-2x, \qquad P_{n+1}(x)=P_n'(x)(1-x^2)^2+4nx(1-x^2) P_n(x)-2xP_n(x)$$ Note that $\displaystyle \sup_{|x|<1} f^{(n)}(x)<+\infty$ , since $f^{(n)}(\pm 1)=0$ . So $\displaystyle |f|_n:=\max_{|x|<1} f^{(n)}(x)$ is well defined. Are there some rough/good estimates on the size $|f|_n$ of the derivatives? Thanks!","['real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

1316488,Explicit fractional linear transformations which rotate the Riemann sphere about the $x$-axis,"Background: Let $S^2$ denote the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. By ""stereographic projection"", I mean the mapping from $S^2$ (remove the north pole) to the complex plane  which sends 
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ t \end{bmatrix} \in S^2  \mapsto z = \frac{x+iy}{1-t} \in \mathbb{C}.
\end{align*}
The inverse mapping, from the complex plane to the sphere, is then given by 
\begin{align*}z = x+iy \in \mathbb{C} \mapsto \frac{2}{|z|^2+1} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  + \left(1 - \frac{2}{|z|^2 + 1}\right) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \in S^2.
\end{align*} Using the above correspondences, we can view a transformation of $\mathbb{C}$ as a transformation of $S^2$, or vice versa. I was especially interested to learn from this question that rotations of the $2$-sphere, i.e. the transformations corresponding to matrices in $SO(3)$, actually correspond to a subset of the fractional linear transformations $z \mapsto \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$. Precisely, $z \mapsto \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ corresponds to a rotation of $S^2$ if and only if $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \\ \end{bmatrix}$ belongs (up to scalar multiple, I guess) to $U(2)$, the group of $2 \times 2$ unitary matrices. In particular, $z \mapsto \frac{1}{z}$ corresponds to rotating $S^2$ by $180$ degrees about the $x$-axis. Upon learning the above fact, I wondered whether I could write down a unitary matrix whose fractional linear transformation corresponds to rotation by a given angle about the $x$-axis. After a while I was able to convince myself that the fractional linear transformation corresponding to 
$$ U_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & i \sin \theta \\ i \sin \theta & \cos \theta \\ \end{bmatrix} \in SU(2)$$
i.e. the mapping
$$f_\theta(z) =  \frac{\cos \theta z + i \sin \theta}{i \sin \theta z + \cos \theta}$$
corresponds to rotation of $S^2$ through an angle of $\theta$ degrees about the $x$-axis, i.e. to the transformation given by the matrix
$$R_{2 \theta} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(2 \theta) & - \sin( 2 \theta) \\ 0 & \sin(2 \theta) & \cos(2 \theta) \\ \end{bmatrix}.$$ The fact that the sphere spins around twice as $\theta : 0 \to 2 \pi$ I guess has something to do with the fact that $SU(2)$ is supposed to double-cover $SO(3)$. Question: How can I efficiently prove that $f_\theta$ and $R_{2 \theta}$ really are the same transformation in different representations? To be sure, one can take a generic point $(x,y,t) \in S^2$ and check that the result of applying stereographic projection and then $f_\theta$ agrees with result of applying $R_{2 \theta}$ and then stereographic projection. However, doing this for specific points $(x,y,t)$ is more or less how I came up with the above formulae, and even then the algebra seemed to get pretty involved. Can somebody provide a more enlightening proof?","['stereographic-projections', 'complex-analysis', 'rotations']"
