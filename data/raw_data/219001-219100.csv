4476991,Limit and conditional expectation commute in a uniformly integrable sequence,"I am thinking of the next proposition: Proposition. Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ a probability space, and $\{X_n\}_{n=1,\cdots}$ a uniformly integrable r.v. sequence s.t. $X_n \rightarrow X ~ \text{a.s.}$ , where $X$ is an $L^1$ r.v. Then for any $\mathcal{G}$ : a sub- $\sigma$ -algebra of $\mathcal{F}$ , we have \begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n | \mathcal{G}] = \mathbb{E}[X | \mathcal{G}] \quad \text{a.s.}
\end{equation*} My quesiont is: Is this proposition true? I consider it indeed is true, for the following reason. For any $A\in \mathcal{G}$ and $R > 0$ , $\{X_n 1_A\}$ is a u.i. sequence, which is shown by \begin{equation*}
\sup_n \mathbb{E}[ |X_n 1_A|, |X_n 1_A| > R ] \leq \sup_n \mathbb{E}[ |X_n |, |X_n| > R ]
\end{equation*} with the right hand side going to $0$ with $R \rightarrow \infty$ (we denote $\mathbb{E}[X,A] = \mathbb{E}[X1_A]$ ). Thus by the commutability of conditional expectation and limit in a u.i. sequence we have \begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[X1_A] = \mathbb{E}[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}X_n 1_A] = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n 1_A]. \qquad (1)
\end{equation*} On the other hand, \begin{align*}
& \mathbb{E}[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n | \mathcal{G}], A] = \mathbb{E}[ ( \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n | \mathcal{G}]) 1_A]  = \mathbb{E}[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\mathbb{E}[X_n | \mathcal{G}] 1_A)] \\
=~& \mathbb{E}[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\mathbb{E}[X_n 1_A | \mathcal{G}])]\\
=~& \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[ \mathbb{E}[X_n 1_A | \mathcal{G}]]\\
=~& \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n 1_A]. \qquad (2)
\end{align*} Here to swap the expectation and the limit I used the fact that the sequence $\{ \mathbb{E}[Y_n | \mathcal{G}] \}_{n=1,\cdots}$ with a u.i. r.v. sequence $\{ Y_n \}_{n=1,\cdots}$ is u.i., which I presume is true. Therefore by (1) and (2), the above proposition holds. A previous post ( https://mathoverflow.net/questions/124589/uniformly-integrable-sequence-such-that-a-s-limit-and-conditional-expectation-d ) claims otherwise, which I guess is wrong: I think one can't compose a u.i. sequence $\{Z_n\} = \{X_n Y_n\}$ that satisfies the conditions written in the link above.","['conditional-expectation', 'uniform-integrability', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

4477045,Details of the self-map on $BO_\infty$ which exchanges tangential and stable-normal structures?,"According to Remark 2.14 in these notes ,
there is a self-map $s : BO_\infty \rightarrow BO_\infty$ which ""exchanges the stable normal and tangential structures"". As I understand it, this means for $X$ a smooth manifold, with tangent bundle classifying
map $\tau : X \rightarrow BO_{\mathrm{dim}X} \hookrightarrow BO_\infty$ ,
and with stable normal bundle classifying map $\nu : X \rightarrow BO_\infty$ ,
then $\tau = s \circ \nu$ and $\nu = s\circ \tau$ (only up to homotopy?). (Here the stable normal bundle is the normal bundle to $X$ w.r.t. a smooth embedding of $X$ in some $S^m$ , for $m$ large enough that all embeddings of $X$ in $S^m$ are isotopic, modulo stable equivalence; the homotopy class of the resulting $X \rightarrow BO_\infty$ should be independent of the choice of $m$ and the embedding. As described in the notes linked above,
such an $m$ depending only on $\mathrm{dim}X$ can be chosen following a theorem of Whitney.) Would anyone be able to suggest a hint on how to find such a map $s$ ?
Or, could anyone suggest a source that explains the details of this construction?","['classifying-spaces', 'principal-bundles', 'vector-bundles', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
4477098,how do you calculate a derivative with respect to another derivative,I just learned some basics principles in Lagrangian mechanics and theres this equation $$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dL}{d(\frac{dx}{dt})}\right)=\frac{dl}{dx}$$ where $l$ is kinetic energy-potential energy and therefore is a function of $x$ and $t$ . What I don't get is how you solve and simplify the $\frac{d}{d(\frac{dx}{dt})}$ part because  it has a derivative at the bottom instead of a variable. When doing some expamples for the lagrangian equation I came across some examples that said that $\frac{d{x}}{d(\frac{dx}{dt})}=0$ . Shouldn't that equal to $0$ only if $x$ is independant of $\frac{dx}{dt}$ ? I feel like I'm missing something significant here... so any help would be much appreciated.

4477126,$\mathbb{S}^n$ is a topological $n$-manifold.,"In Lee's ""Introduction to Smooth Manifolds"" he provides the following example showing that $\mathbb{S}^n$ is a topological $n$ -manifold. For each integer $n \geq 0$ , the unit $n$ -sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ is Hausdorff and second-countable because it is a topological subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ . To show that it is locally Euclidean, for each index $i = 1, \ldots, n+1$ let $U_i^+$ denote the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ where the $i$ th coordinate is positive: $$U_i^+ = \big\{(x^1, \ldots, x^{n+1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}: x^i > 0\big\}.$$ Similarly, $U_i^-$ is the set where $x^i < 0$ . Let $f: \mathbb{B}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the continuous function $$f(u) = \sqrt{1-|u|^2}.$$ Then for each $i = 1, \ldots, n+1$ , it is easy to check that $U_i^+ \cap \mathbb{S}^n$ is the graph of the function $$x^i = f(x^1, \ldots, \hat{x}^i, \ldots, x^{n+1}),$$ where the hat indicates that $x^i$ is omitted. Similarly, $U_i^- \cap \mathbb{S}^n$ is the graph of the function $$x^i = -f(x^1, \ldots, \hat{x}^i, \ldots, x^{n+1}).$$ Thus, each subset $U_i^\pm \cap \mathbb{S}^n$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ , and the maps $\varphi_i^\pm: U_i^\pm \cap \mathbb{S}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^n$ given by $$\varphi_i^\pm(x^1, \ldots, x^{n+1}) = (x^1, \ldots, \hat{x}^i, \ldots, x^{n+1})$$ are graph coordinates for $\mathbb{S}^n$ . Since each point of $\mathbb{S}^n$ is in the domain of at least one of these $2n+2$ charts, $\mathbb{S}^n$ is a topolgoical $n$ -manifold. My question is perhaps more on notation, but how is $U_i^+ \cap \mathbb{S}^n$ (likewise for $U_i^- \cap \mathbb{S}^n$ ) a graph using the given definition? As I understand it, we are omitting $x^i$ when passing the point in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ into $f$ , is the result of the function the new value for $x^i$ ? However, this seems incorrect as $\varphi$ doesn't seem to involve $f$ at all, so how does it follow that the maps are indeed graph coordinates (or more generally, coordinate maps)?","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
4477179,Prove that a bounded nondecreasing function is differentiable Lebesgue-almost everywhere,"Let $g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ be bounded, nondecreasing and right-continuous. We know that there is a unique finite measure $\mu_g$ on $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ with $$\mu_g((a,b])=g(b)-g(a)\;\;\;\text{for all }a\le b\tag1.$$ Moreover, by Lebesgue`s decomposition theroem, $$\mu_g=\mu_g^a+\mu_g^s\tag2$$ for some finite measures $\mu_g^a\ll\lambda$ and $\mu_g^s\perp\lambda$ , wher $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ . Furthermore $^1$ , $\mathbb R\setminus\mathcal D(\mu_g^a)$ is a $\lambda$ -null set and $$\frac{{\rm d}\mu_g^a}{{\rm d}\lambda}={\rm D}\mu_gâ\tag5$$ and $\mathbb R\setminus\mathcal D(\mu_g^s)$ is a $\lambda$ -null set and $$\mathcal D(\mu_g^s)=0\;\;\;\lambda^{\otimes d}\text{-almost everywhere}\tag6.$$ How do we conclude that $g$ is differentiable $\lambda$ -almost everywhere? From the definition we see that $${\rm D}\mu(x):=\lim_{r\to0+}\frac{\mu_g^a((x-r,x+r))}{\lambda((x-r,x+r))}\;\;\;\text{for all }x\in\mathcal D(\mu_gâ)\tag7.$$ But this looks more like this could be more useful to show symmetric differentiability , which is not enough to show differentiability. $^1$ If $d\in\mathbb N$ and $\mu$ is a locally finite measure on $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)^{\otimes d}$ , let $$\mathcal D(\mu):=\left\{x\in\mathbb R^d:\limsup_{r\to0+}\frac{\mu(B_r(x))}{\lambda^{\otimes d}(B_r(x))}<\infty\right\}$$ and $${\rm D}\mu(x):=\lim_{r\to0+}\frac{\mu(B_r(x))}{\lambda^{\otimes d}(B_r(x))}\;\;\;\text{for }x\in\mathcal D(\mu).$$ We can show that if $\mu\ll\lambda^{\otimes d}$ , then $\mathbb R^d\setminus\mathcal D(\mu)$ is a $\lambda^{\otimes d}$ -null set and $$\frac{{\rm d}\mu}{{\rm d}\lambda^{\otimes d}}={\rm D}\mu\tag3$$ (where ${\rm D}\mu$ is arbitrary extended to $\mathbb R^d$ ). if $\mu\perp\lambda^{\otimes d}$ , then $\mathbb R^d\setminus\mathcal D(\mu)$ is a $\lambda^{\otimes d}$ -null set and $$\mathcal D(\mu)=0\;\;\;\lambda^{\otimes d}\text{-almost everywhere}\tag4.$$","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'radon-nikodym', 'real-analysis']"

4477220,Intersection of decreasing sequence of sets,"In an exam, my teacher wrote this problem , I proved it in a similar way to the answer in that post , but he pointed out to me that a step in the proof is wrong.

4477235,How to calculate the statistical uncertainty in a particle physics simulation?,"I have a Monte Carlo code which simulates ions in a Tokamak . Most of the particles remain trapped forever. However, some of the particles escape. I can use my code to predict the fraction of particles that escape versus those that stay trapped. The code models collisions using a stochastic collision operator. Therefore, there is a statistical uncertainty with my results. Do you know any techniques to calculate this statistical uncertainty? One idea I had is to use the Bootstrapping technique . I'll quickly explain my plan now: Suppose we have $N$ trapped particles and $n<N$ that escape. We denote the particles that are trapped with $t_i$ (for $i\in\{1,2,...,N\}$ ) and the ones that escape with $e_i$ (for $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$ ). Hence, the estimate for the fraction of markers that escape is $n/(n+N)$ . To calculate the uncertainty, we make a list which looks like the following: $$\{t_1,t_2,...,t_N,e_1,e_2,...,e_n\}.$$ We resample this list (with replacement) $m$ times (e.g. $m=100$ ) to produce lists which may look something like this: $$\underbrace{\{t_{36}, e_{12}, t_{444}, t_{321},...\}}_{n+N\ \mathrm{elements}}.$$ Then calculate the fraction of markers which escape for each of the $m$ cases and take away $n/(n+N)$ to produce a list of values with length $m$ . Finally, take, e.g. a 95% quantile of this to get a 95% confidence interval. Can you see any problems with this method? Is there a more straightforward method I could be using? I know barely any statistics, so any advice is appreciated.","['statistics', 'monte-carlo', 'computational-mathematics', 'physics', 'mathematical-physics']"

4477666,Does this property of algebra morphisms (related to idempotents) have a name?,"Let $F$ be a field. I am in the category of finite-dimensional $F$ -algebras. Let $f:A \rightarrow B$ a homomorphism of two of those. The property of $f$ which came up as useful in something I consider is: $$(*) \text{ For every idempotent } e \in A, \dfrac{\dim_F(A\cdot e)}{\dim_F(A)} = \dfrac{\dim_F(B \cdot f(e))}{\dim_F(B)}.$$ (For example, the diagonal embedding $diag: F \rightarrow F \times F$ has this property, but funnily the map $diag \times id: F \times F \rightarrow F \times F \times F$ does not.) I could call an $f$ satisfying $(*)$ ""consistent"" or something, but there's far too many of those words already. So I was hoping somebody who knows more about algebras and algebraic geometry can tell me, ""ah, that's just an unusual way to say that $f$ is (locally etale / proper / flat and finitely presented / some other cool words)"". Question : Is property $(*)$ equivalent to some well-known property or combination of properties of algebra morphisms? At least maybe in the case that one or both of $A, B$ are commutative (some algebro-geometric term)? Or is it at least, say, stronger than (well-known condition C1) but weaker than (well-known condition C1)?

4477720,Is there an accurate way to estimate the product $\prod_{n=1}^{1009}\frac{2n+1}{2n}$?,"I don't have a background in mathematics, I just was doing this for fun...so if there are any flaws in any logic below please feel free to correct the logic. Anyways, there was a question posed in this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZPFIQ8kIUs ) asking if $(1+\frac{1}{2})(1+\frac{1}{4})(1+\frac{1}{6})...(1+\frac{1}{1009}) > 50$ or not. The algebra behind why the product is less than $50$ is clear, but I was curious if there was a way to estimate or accurately determine what this number actually is or might be. My attempt to find that out goes as follows: $$(1+\frac{1}{2})(1+\frac{1}{4})(1+\frac{1}{6})...(1+\frac{1}{2018}) = \frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\cdots\frac{2019}{2018} = \prod_{n=1}^{1009}\frac{2n+1}{2n}.$$ Doing a little bit of research I read that you can write a product $\prod a_i$ as: $$e^{\sum\ln(a_i)},$$ which is essentially a Riemann sum (I believe) and thus allows one to write: $$e^{\int \ln(a_i)}.$$ If the reason why $e^{\sum \ln(a_i)} = e^{\int \ln(a_i)}$ isn't because the summation isn't a Riemann sum, I would be curious to read a brief explanation in a comment below as to the reasoning for why they're equal. Back to the calculation... \begin{align}
\prod_{n=1}^{1009}\frac{2n+1}{2n} = \prod_{n=1}^{1009}{(2n+1)}\cdot\prod_{n=1}^{1009}{\frac{1}{2n}} = e^{\int_1^n{\ln(2n+1)}}\cdot e^{\int_1^n{\ln(\frac{1}{2n})}} \quad (1)
\end{align} After a bit more research I figured out I could use Stirling approximation to determine the values of $\ln\big(\frac{1}{2n}\big)$ and $\ln(2n+1)$ . From the Stirling approximation Wikipedia page I learned that $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n{\ln(j)} \approx \int_1^n {\ln(x) dx} = n\cdot \ln(n) - n + 1$ , so: $$\sum_{j=1}^n{\ln(\frac{1}{2n})} = -2\cdot \sum_{j=1}^n{\ln(n)} = -2\cdot \int_1^n {\ln(x) dx} = -2\cdot (n\cdot \ln(n) - n + 1)\\and\\\sum_{j=1}^n{\ln({2n+1})} = \sum_{j=2}^{n+1}{\ln(2n)} = 2\cdot \sum_{j=2}^{n+1}{\ln(n)} = 2\cdot \int_2^{n+1} {\ln(x) dx} = 2\cdot (n\cdot \ln(n) - n + 1)$$ So from $(1)$ we now have, $$e^{2\cdot \int_2^{n+1} {\ln(x) dx}}\cdot e^{-2\cdot \int_1^n {\ln(x) dx}} = \frac{e^{2\cdot \int_2^{n+1} {\ln(x) dx}}}{e^{2\cdot \int_1^n {\ln(x) dx}}}$$ and with $n = 1009$ , we have $$\frac{e^{\int_2^{1010} {\ln(x) dx}}}{e^{\int_1^{1009} {\ln(x) dx}}} \approx \frac{e^{5977.88266...}}{e^{5970.96545...}} = e^{6.91721} = 1009.49955 > 50$$ But we know that the product we're trying to estimate is less than $50$ . In order to get a value for $x$ such that $e^{x}<50$ , then $x < 3.912$ . From the Stirling approximation, we found $x$ to be $6.91721$ . However, upon further reading about Stirling approximation of $\ln(x)$ can be off by $0.008$ . For the given value of $5977.88266...$ this means the real value can fall within $5977.88266... \pm 107$ , which means the difference between $5977.88266...$ and $5970.96545...$ are within margin of error. Despite them being so close to each other, to get the proper estimate, their difference needs to be less than $3.912$ . However I don't know how to move forward in being able to find an estimation, unless the logic behind my estimation is flawed...in which case the solution would be found as per finding out the error. But if my logic was sound and this discrepancy between $e^{6.91721}$ and $e^{x<3.912}$ is just the result of approximation errors in the Stirling approximation, then my question becomes: Is there a way to better accurately determine or approximate this answer?","['calculus', 'approximation', 'analysis']"
4477783,Reference for topological invariants written in integrals,"When studying physics, I came up with various integrals that only takes integer values due to topological reasons.

More generally, homotopy class of a map from $S^d$ or $T^d$ to a Lie group $G$ is often represented by an integral, as I saw in various physics literature (one example is Homotopy and quantization in condensed matter physics , written by mathematical physicists). I want a systematic theory on this matter. Already in this site, there are at least two questions related to my question, which focuses on a specific choice of $X$ and $Y$ when classifying maps $X\to Y$ : Why is the winding number of a matrix an integer? Cartan 3-form on a Lie group G What I want to address is more general, since I feel that there is a more general theory of obtaining homotopy invariant as an integral. Let $X = S^d$ or $T^d$ , and let $G$ be a ""nice"" Lie group (say, compact). What is the homotopy class $[X, G]$ ? Can we associate an invariant written in terms of an integral over $X$ that takes only integer values? If such invariant exists, when does this invariant completely characterizes the homotopy class? In particular, in the link Why is the winding number of a matrix an integer? , a map $f:S^1→U(N)$ is classified by the degree of the map $\det\circ f:S^1\to S^1$ . Then, does this invariant completely characterizes $[S^1,U(N)]$ ? Any answers or references on this question is welcomed. I have a basic knowledge of algebraic topology and differential geometry. Note added : After several comments, I can make my question more concrete. According to a comment: If $f:X→G$ is smooth and $\omega$ is a $k$ -form representing an
integer cohomology class on $G$ , then $f^∗\omega$ will be a $k$ -form
on $X$ representing an integer cohomology class. In particular,
integrating it against an integer homology class will give an integer
invariant of $f$ . My question following the comment is: How to find a $k$ -form representing an integer cohomology class? What is the ""integer homology class""?

The probability that the i-th experiment will be over within an hour from the moment it began is $\frac{i}{10}, 1\leq i\leq 10$ 1st part: (Assuming all the experiments are started at the same time,) what is the
expected number of experiments that will be over within an hour? The solution just says 1 (without further explanation) but I disagree. At least one (the 10th experiment) will be over within an hour with probability 1, and the rest also have non-zero probability to end within the same time, so the expectancy has to be at least greater than 1. My way of solving this was to define each experiment as a random variable $x_i$ such that $$
x_i=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle 1,  & \text{w.p. $\frac{i}{10}$ } \\
0, & \text{w.p. $\frac{10-i}{10}$ }
\end{cases}
$$ each with expectancy $E[x_i]=\frac{i}{10}$ ,
and then define $$Y=\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i$$ Thus, the expectancy would be $$
E[Y]=E[\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{10}E[x_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{10}\frac{i}{10}=5.5
$$ By linearity of expectation. To verify my solution, I tried calculating $P(y)$ for each $y, 0\leq y\leq 10$ and then finding out the expectancy using its definition for discrete random variables. I've got the values for $y=0, 1, 9, 10$ but the rest were too difficult to generalize. The 2nd part is as follows (it's unrelated to the 1st one, just to the main question): What's the probability that the 5th experiment was over (within an hour), given a randomly selected experiment is over? It wasn't quite clear in the question, but I'm assuming that they meant all the experiments had started, and after an hour we picked one randomly and it was over, what's the probability that it's the 5th one? I calculated the probability for a randomly selected experiment to be over by multipling the probability for each experiment to be over with the probability for choosing it (using the law of total probability). Each experiment is equally likely to be choosen, so $$
P(B)=\sum_{i=1}^{10}\frac{i}{10}\frac{1}{10}=0.55
$$ Then, if $A_5$ is the event that the 5th experiment was over, $$
P(A_5 | B)=\frac{P(B|A_5)P(A_5)}{P(B)}=\frac{1\cdot \frac{1}{10}}{0.55}=0.182
$$ But in the solution they defined $A_5$ as the event that the 5th experiment was choosen (so in general $P(A_i)=\frac{1}{10}$ for every $i$ ) and said $$
P(A_5 | B)=\frac{P(B|A_5)P(A_5)}{P(B)}=\frac{\frac{5}{10}\cdot \frac{1}{10}}{0.55}=0.091

4478060,Prove that the Jacobian is constant,"Suppose that $u=u(x,y)$ and $v=v(x,y)$ have continuous second partial derivatives. If for each $f$ , we have $$\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial u^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial v^2}=\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2},$$ prove that the Jacobian $\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\\\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{pmatrix}$ is constant. By using the chain rule, $$\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2}=\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial u^2}+2\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)^2\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial v^2}\\
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial y^2}=\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^2\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial u^2}+2\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)^2\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial v^2}$$ and we see that the Jacobian is orthogonal.

4478093,Number of $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^a(x) = x+b$,"This is a generalized version of the IMO problem: Prove that the function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(f(x)) = x+k$ is nonexistent if $k$ is odd. Now here is my problem: For natural numbers $a,b$ , let $$\mathcal{F} = \{f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\mid \forall x \in \mathbb{N},\: f^a(x) = x+b \}$$ (a) Find a neccesary and sufficient for $\mathcal{F} \neq \varnothing$ . (b) Find $|\mathcal{F}|$ . (in terms of $a$ and $b$ ) I was able to give proof for (a), by mimicking the solution of the above IMO problem. I think that $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty iff $a\mid b$ . Let $S_i = f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , where $S_0 = \mathbb{N} \setminus f(\mathbb{N})$ . Proposition 1. $f^{j}(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq f^{i}(\mathbb{N})$ if $i \leq j$ . Proof. Since $f^{j}(\mathbb{N}) = f^{i}(f^{j-i}(\mathbb{N}))$ and $f^{j-i}(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ , it is pretty clear. Proposition 2. $S_i \cap S_j = \varnothing$ if $i \neq j$ . Proof. WLOG $i<j$ . Since $S_{i} = f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , so $S_i$ does not contain the elements of $f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ . However, $S_j = f^{j}(\mathbb{N})\setminus  f^{j+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , so $S_j$ is a subset of $f^{j}(\mathbb{N})$ , and thus a subset of $f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , by proposition 1. So they are disjoint. Proposition 3. $|S_i| = |S_j|$ for all $i,j$ . Proof. It suffices to show that $|S_i| = |S_{i+1}|$ . I claim that $f$ is actually a bijection between them. (upon restriction of domain to $S_i$ ) We know that $f$ is an injection since $f^a$ is an injection. So surjectivity is a problem. Let $x \in f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+2}(\mathbb{N})$ , then there exists $y \in f^{i}(\mathbb{N})$ such that $f(y) = x$ , by definition. But if $y \in  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N})$ , then $f(y) = x \in f^{i+2}(\mathbb{N})$ , contradiction. Therefore $y \in f^{i}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{i+1}(\mathbb{N}) = S_i$ , proving surjectivity. Let's say $|S_i| = n$ for all $i$ . Proposition 4. $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty iff $a|b$ . Proof. If part is obvious(give $f(x) = x + b/a$ ). So let's go for only if part. Consider the set $$ \bigcup_{i = 0}^{a-1} S_i = [\mathbb{N} \setminus f(\mathbb{N})] \cup \cdots \cup [f^{a-1}(\mathbb{N}) \setminus  f^{a}(\mathbb{N})] = \mathbb{N} \setminus f^{a}(\mathbb{N})$$ And note that $\mathbb{N} \setminus f^{a}(\mathbb{N}) = \{1,2,\cdots, b\}$ by the condition of problem. However since $S_i$ 's are all disjoint, so $\left| \bigcup_{i = 0}^{a-1} S_i \right| = an = b $ . Thus $\mathcal{F} = \varnothing $ if $a \nmid b$ , completing the proof. However, I have no idea about (b). Hint for this problem suggests finding a bijection from $\mathcal{F}$ to some easy set, such as a subset of $S_b$ (symmetric group). But what is the set? How can I evaluate the size of $|\mathcal{F}|$ ? Thank you for any help, hint, or solution.","['elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'contest-math']"

4478112,Solving $ y' = x+y $ with Euler's method,"I was going over Euler's method for solving DE and I had an idea: Could we use it to get an exact solution to a DE by considering an infinitesimal step size? This is the main idea:  if the approximations get better the smaller the step size, what if we took the limit as the step size $ h $ go to zero (consider an infinitesimal step size), in theory that should make the approximations exact. This is how I implemented that idea: Given a first order linear ODE $ dy/dx=F(x,y) $ with initial conditions $ (x_0, y_0) $ and step size $ h $ . Euler's Method: $ x_{n+1} = x_n + h , \ \ \ \    y_{n+1} = y_n +F(x_n, y_n)h  $ Consider the DE $ dy/dx=x+y, \ \ \ y(0)=1 $ and consider an arbitrary step size $ h $ . To approximate the value of the function at an arbitrary $ x $ value we would need the following iterations $ x_1=x_o+h $ $ x_2 = x_1+h  = (x_o+h)+h = x_o+2h $ $ x_3 = x_2+h = (x_o+2h)+h = x_o+3h $ $ \vdots $ $ x_n = x $ (Iterate until we reach our desired $ x $ value). If we take a look at the pattern that emerges for each successive iteration, we can see that $ x_n = x_0+nh $ . Solving the equation above for $ n $ we get.. $ x_n=x $ $ x_0+nh=x \implies n = \cfrac{x-x_0}{h} $ Here, $ n $ is the number of iterations needed to reach a desired $ x $ value with an initial condition $ x_0 $ and step size $ h $ . Here we can see why having a step size that is infinitesimally small would result in an infinite number of iterations (as $ h \to 0 $ , $ n \to \infty $ ). Now let us consider the iterations for $ y $ . $ y_{n+1}=y_n+F(x_n,y_n)h $ $ y_{n+1}=y_n+(x_n+y_n)h $ (Plugging in our $ x_n $ from above, we get...) $ y_{n+1}=y_n+((x_0+nh)+y_n)h $ We can now solve this recurrence relation with initial conditions $ y(x_0)=y_0 $ $ y(n+1)=y(n)+(x_0+nh+y(n))h, \ \ \ \ y(x_0)=y_0 $ $ y(n)=(x_0h + x_0 + y_0 + 1)(h+1)^{n-x_0}-x_0 -hn -1 $ (Plugging in our initial conditions $ (x_0, y_0) = (0, 1) $ , we get...) $ y(n)=2(h+1)^n -hn-1 $ This is a function in terms of $ n $ and our solution has to be in terms of $ x $ . At this step we plug in our $ n $ from above and rewrite this in terms of $ x $ . $ n = \cfrac{x-x_0}{h} = \cfrac{x}{h} $ $ y(x) \approx 2(h+1)^{x/h}-h \left( \cfrac{x}{h}\right)-1 $ $ y(x) \approx 2(h+1)^{x/h}-x-1 $ And finally we take the limit as the step size $ h $ go to zero. $ \displaystyle y(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \left[ 2(h+1)^{x/h}-x-1 \right] $ $ \displaystyle y(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\left[ 2(h+1)^{x/h} \right]-x-1 $ $ \displaystyle y(x)=2\lim_{h\to 0}\left[(h+1)^{x/h} \right]-x-1 $ $ y(x) = 2e^x-x-1 $ It can be verified that $ \displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}(h+1)^{x/h}=e^x $ And there we have it, we have just solved $ dy/dx = x+y, \ \ y(0)=1 $ exactly using Euler's Method by considering an infinitesimally small step size $ h $ . Has this been done before? Or does this method have a special name? I tried researching 'Euler's method with an infinitesimal step size' but I found nothing.

4478118,Probability of being close to a cycle permutation is $o(1)$,"I'm trying to prove that in some sense, cycle (maybe circular is a better wording?) permutations are ""sparse"" in the set of all permutations $S_n$ . Let's assume permutations distribute uniformly out of the $n!$ combinations. It is clear that the probability of getting a cycle permutation is $\frac{1}{n}$ . My question is what happens when we ""dilate"" the set according the the Hamming distance $$d(\sigma, \pi) = \frac{1}{n}\left |\left \{ i: \sigma(i)\ne \pi(i)\right \}\right |$$ Then denote the event of being $\epsilon$ -close to a cycle, i.e. $d(\sigma, \text{set of all cycles})<\epsilon$ , for instance for $\epsilon = \frac{1}{4}$ . How can I show this occurs in probability $o(1)$ if this is even true? I tried to upper-bound the probability by considering in how many ways I can degrade any $\frac{n}{4}$ indices of a given cycle, while still remaining a permutation, and got the bound $\frac{(n-1)!\binom{n}{n/4}(\frac{n}{4})!}{n!}$ which is way too loose. I thought of maybe representing the number of changes to get a cycle as a sum of indicator random variables somehow, and bound the probability to deviate from the expectation.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

Now we have: $$1+\sqrt{1-x}=2x^2-2x\sqrt{1-x^2} \tag1$$ Squaring the above equation both sides we get $$2(1+\sqrt{1-x})-x=4x^4+4x^2(1-x^2)-8x^3\sqrt{1-x^2} \tag2$$ From $(1)$ we get $$2(2x^2-2x\sqrt{1-x^2})-x=4x^2-8x^3\sqrt{1-x^2} \tag3$$ $\implies$ $$(8x^3-4x)\sqrt{1-x^2}=x \tag4$$ So we have: $$(8x^2-4)\sqrt{1-x^2}=1 \tag5$$ Letting $\sqrt{1-x^2}=p, p>0$ We get $$8p^3-4p+1=0 \tag6$$ which gives $p = 0.5, \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}$ So using $x=\pm \sqrt{1-p^2}$ we get four values of $x$ as: $$x=\frac{\pm \sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{\pm \sqrt{10+2 \sqrt{5}}}{4} \tag7$$ Out of which only $$x=\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{-\sqrt{10+2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}$$ Will satisfy.

4478329,Two ways of defining connection coefficients,"I am relatively new to general relativity, and I am puzzled about the relationship between two ways of introducing connection coefficients on a differentiable manifold. One way (e.g. in S. Carroll's ""Spacetime & Geometry"") defines the connection coefficients, $\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}$ , as arising from a linear correction added to the partial derivative of a vector field, $\partial_\mu V^{\nu}$ , to make the whole thing --- $\nabla_\mu V^\nu = \partial_\mu V^{\nu} + \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}V^\lambda$ --- transform like a tensor. To achieve this, the $\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}$ have to satisfy a certain transformation law, but otherwise there are no constraints. So it seems this leaves us with a lot of freedom in choosing the connection coefficients: Fixing a coordinate system, I can choose any combination of $4\cdot 4\cdot 4 = 64$ smooth functions to define my connection coefficients. The other way introduces connection coefficients (as far as I understand) as arising from the change in the basis vectors when traveling between tangent spaces (as seen from the perspective of the basis of the original tangent space): \begin{align}
&\partial_\mu \left(V^{\nu}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{(\nu)}\right)\\
=& \left(\partial_\mu V^\nu\right)\cdot \mathbf{e}_{(\nu)} + V^\lambda \cdot \left(\partial_\mu \mathbf{e}_{(\lambda)}\right)\\
=& \left(\partial_\mu V^\nu\right)\cdot \mathbf{e}_{(\nu)} + V^\lambda \cdot \left(\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}\mathbf{e}_{(\nu)}\right)\\
=&\left(\partial_\mu V^\nu + V^\lambda \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}\right)\cdot \mathbf{e}_{(\nu)} 
\end{align} where in the third step we have defined $\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}\mathbf{e}_{(\nu)} := \partial_\mu \mathbf{e}_{(\lambda)}$ . I'm puzzled because this second way of defining the connection coefficients doesn't seem to come with the same freedom in choosing the coefficients: By fixing a chart, we already fix a basis of the tangent space at each point within the chart's domain, and so it seems we automatically fix the connection coefficients as expressed in that chart. Whereas previously we could choose the connection coefficients by freely choosing $64$ different functions, now there seems to be a unique connection (at least within that part of the chart's domain which doesn't overlap with any other chart's domain).

4478353,Non-simple group with only two quotients (up to isomorphism),"In Paul Cohn's Universal Algebra book, p. 61, he writes ""[...]Every $\Omega$ -algebra $A$ has itself and the trivial algebra as homomorphic images.

By [the first isomorphism theorem] an $\Omega$ -algebra $A$ is simple if and only if has precisely two congruences, namely $A^2$ and $\Delta$ [the diagonal]."" Here, as usual, we identify algebras up to isomorphism. I am pretty sure this is wrong. At least, the argument does not follow, as a quotient of a strucutre $A$ by a non-trivial congruence may be still isomorphic to $A$ (e.g. the multiplicative circle $\mathbb{S}^1\subseteq\mathbb{C}\setminus\left\{0\right\}$ modulo $\left\{\pm 1\right\}$ , as a structure in the signature of groups; or any infinite set modulo a relation that identifies two points, in the empty signature.)

Given some number of identical balls $1 < n\leq \frac{u}{2}$ , how many ways can you distribute them into a line of urns $u$ such that no two adjacent urns contain balls, and each urn may contain only 1 ball. Alternatively: given the same constraints on $n$ , what is the probability that the urns will contain a run of at least 2 adjacent balls (the real problem I'm trying to solve). My attempt thus far: The way to compute the ways we can order the balls is a combination $u\choose{n}$ , since the balls are indistinguishable. The first part of the problem may be an easier (or harder formulation) but I tried to tackle it with the understanding that I could use the following setup: $$\frac{{u\choose{n}} - part1}{u\choose n}$$ Where part1 is the solution to the first question. So, this reads: the total number of ways to arrange the balls - all the ways the balls are completely separated from each other, divided by all the configurations, to give me the probability I wanted as the solution for part 2. I think I'm on the right track here for solving part1, but I can't confirm it's correct. I think it's just ${u-n+1}\choose{n}$ . My (shaky) justification is that to guarantee there are no runs of adjacent balls, I must position the balls in a limited set of spaces, and this limit seemed right, though I'm unsure how to demonstrate it. I've done some empirical tests which seem to confirm it, and it looks like it works even for edge cases of only 1 ball (returns 0% probability), but I could seriously use a cross-check here. All in all, my final function is the following: $$\frac{{u\choose{n}} - {u-n+1\choose{n}} }{u\choose n}$$ And here's some Julia code that I used to ""verify"" it: #Recursively checks a list for consecutive 1s, returns a list of all instances.

Secondly, will every level curve necessarily intersect with the $x$ -axis and the $y$ -axis for the domain $X = \mathbb{R^2_{+}}$ ( $0 \in \mathbb{R_{+}}$ )? If $\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} > \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} \implies f(x_1, x_2) > f(y_1, y_2)$ for all comparable $(x_1, x_2) \in X$ and $(y_1, y_2) \in X$ , then we call $f$ (weakly) monotone. Context : While doing Economics, I was wondering if convex and monotone preferences (assuming completeness and transitivity) can have indifference curves that are not path-connected. A more precise version of the question will be: Given $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ and a preference relation $\succeq$ that is complete, transitive, convex and monotone, does there exist an indifference curve which is not path-connected? Definitions: Convexity: $\forall x,y \in X: x \succeq y \implies \lambda x + (1-\lambda) y \succeq y \ \forall \lambda \in [0,1]$ . Monotonicity: $\forall x, y \in X: x \geq y \implies x \succeq y$ . [Here, if $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $y = (y_1, y_2)$ , then $x \geq y$ means $(x_1 \geq x_2) \land (y_1 \geq y_2)$ .] Indifference curve (IC): Suppose $x \in X$ . Then the set of elements that are indifferent to $x$ is given by $\text{IC}(x) := \{y \in X : y \succeq x \land x \succeq y \}$ . If $y \in \text{IC}(x)$ , we say $y \sim x$ where $\sim$ denotes indifference. Completeness and transitivity is defined similar to any other binary operator. This is a more precise version of the problem as there may not (necessarily) exist a function $f$ that describes $\succeq$ .

PS(2022-6-25):  After some thinking, I think it is irrelevant with convex on manifold, since $W_p$ is vector space.  Besides, by maltreat the Weitzenbock formula, I give a rough process : Weitzenbock formula: assuming $\omega=\omega_i dx^i$ and $\overline\omega$ is the dual vector of $\omega$ , then $$
\Delta \omega (Y) = tr \nabla^2 \omega(Y) - R(\overline\omega,Y)
$$ Roughly, (or similarly), I have $$
(\Delta_A E)(\omega) = (tr A^2 E)\omega - g^{ij} R(e_i,\omega)E(e_j) 
$$ By Bianchi, I have $$
R(e_i, \omega) E(e_j) + R(\omega, E)e_i(e_j) + R(E,e_i)\omega(e_j)=0
$$ Therefore,  (treat $R(e_i, \omega) E(e_j)$ as $\langle R(e_i, \omega) E, e_j \rangle $ ) $$
g^{ij}R(e_i,\omega) E(e_j) = -\frac{1}{2}g^{ij} R(e_i, e_j)E(\omega)
$$ At last, I get $$
\Delta_A E = tr A^2 E+ \frac{1}{2} tr R(\cdot, \cdot)E
$$ So, the $(2)$ is redundant. And since it is ordinary convex, $(1)$ must be right.  Therefore, we can get $(9.5.6)$ . But the process  is very rough. Who can rigorous it? Thanks.","['ricci-flow', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Nevertheless, this got me interested and everytime I try to read the literature, I get all confused by these algebras: Projective Geometric Algebra PGA, Clifford Algebra, Grassman Algebra, Geometric Algebra, Exterior Algebra, Quaternion Algebra I maybe wrong but I observe: Quaternion algebra feels like the odd one out (but everyone mentions it). All other algebras support the wedge product. Some algebra merge dot and wedge into one operations and some don't. Some algebra is fixed only to three (or four homogeneous) dimensions. Clifford seems like a superset of all except Quaternion. Exterior and Grassman seems to be the same thing but it doesn't merge dot and wedge together. Geometric Algebra does seem merge them together and PGA is like Geometric but in 3D. For those who know, please tell what is the difference between all these algebras and a little history and chronology (if that is too much to ask, a link to appropriate resource will be appreciated) and which algebra should I pick to study (and optionally suggest a good book) if my interest is mostly computer graphics and I want to overcome the limitations that vanilla Linear Algebra has.

Notice that $4d^{2}-2d+1$ has negative discriminant: $D = -12$ , and so it is always one sign, which is positive in this case. So we cannot narrow $d$ -solution this way. Next, since $(a+b+c)^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} + 2(ab+ac+bc)$ , we get $$ 9d^{2} - 2(ab+ac+bc) = 4d^{2}-2d+1  $$ $$ 5d^{2} + 2d -1 = 2(ab+ac+bc) $$ $5d^{2} + 2d - 1 = 0$ has solutions: $$ d_{1,2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{24}}{10} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{6}}{5}$$ and when $d > (-1 + \sqrt{6})/5$ , OR, $d < (-1 - \sqrt{6})/5$ we have $5d^{2}+2d-1 > 0$ .

In other words, I would like a probability density $f$ on the unit circle whose first circular moment also lies on the unit circle. Using a little Fourier series, the conditions 2 and 3 above are equivalent to saying $f$ has the form $$ f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \left( 1 + 2 \cos{\theta} \right) + \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z} \backslash \{ \pm 1 , 0 \}} a_n e^{in\theta} \tag{*} $$ for some coefficients $a_n \in \mathbb{C}$ . The question then becomes whether it is possible to choose the $a_n$ so that $f$ is non-negative. My intuition tells me, if such a function exists, then it would be rather pathological. Question: Is some able to demonstrate the existence/non-existence of such a function? If such a function exists and is ""nice"" (e.g. smooth), is a closed-form possible? Context: I've been studying some directional statistics and I've noticed that many of the wrapped distributions have the property that their circular moments do not lie on the unit circle. For example, the wrapped normal distribution has circular moments $\langle e^{in\theta} \rangle = e^{in\mu - n^2 \sigma^2 / 2}$ , where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the unwrapped distribution. Clearly, this lies on $S^1$ only if $\sigma = 0$ , in which case the wrapped normal becomes a Dirac comb distribution. Part of me feels like this behavior is reasonable: depending on where the distribution is concentrated, it will ""pull"" the unit vector $e^{in\theta}$ toward the concentration center (in this case $\mu$ ), but not ""all the way"". For a uniform distribution, e.g. $\sigma \rightarrow + \infty$ , the circular moments all lie at the origin (i.e., they all get ""pulled"" equally in all directions). I started to wonder if this is always the case for probability densities on the unit circle. Or could I, at the very least, make the first moment lie on the unit circle?","['probability-distributions', 'real-analysis', 'fourier-series', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

4478997,Formal group of Abelian Varieties,"I am reading Barry Mazur and Tom Weston's note Euler Systems and Arithmetic Geometry ([here][1] is the link).

Then the kernel $A_1$ of the reduction map $A(\mathcal O)\to A(k)$ can be identified with the $\mathfrak m-$ valued points of some formal group. Here, I guess this formal group is defined by the completion of $\mathcal A$ (the Neron model of $A$ ) along $\mathfrak m$ at the identity element, similarly to the elliptic curve case (you can see more detail about this definition [here][2], Andrei Jorza's thesis, section 2.6.1). Is it true? When $A$ is an elliptic curve, this result is proved in Joseph Silverman's book, The arithmetic of elliptic curves, Chapter VII. Proposition 2.2. However, it seems that this proof can not handle the general case because abelian varieties can not be described by explicit equations. Can anyone provide me some hints with any reference to this fact? Edit: It is Theorem C.2.6 in Diophantine Geometry, M. Hindry and J. Silverman. The construction of formal groups and the proof of the theorem are quite similar to the elliptic curve case.

4479131,Maximum amount of iterations to get to an empty list from repeatedly taking the smallest complement of a list,"I was trying to solve Iterative Smallest Complement on the Code Golf website, and thought of an interesting question. A basic run down of what the smallest complement of a list is: ... B is a complement of A if: B has all of the integers between the minimum and maximum of A which are missing from A , and B has none of the integers present in A So basically, you make the list $[\min(A)\ldots\max(A)]\backslash A$ , where $\backslash$ represents set difference. Now given a list of non-repeating numbers $A$ , repeatedly find the smallest complement until you obtain the empty set, and record how many iterations it took. Iterations include the initial list $A$ and the empty set: $\{\}$ . For example, given $A=[1,3,4,5,8]$ , the iterations are as follows: $[1,3,4,5,8]$ $[2,6,7]$ $[3,4,5]$ $[]$ So, $4$ iterations when $A=[1,3,4,5,8]$ . Now I was wondering: For any given list $L$ which includes no repeating numbers, what is the highest amount of iterations possible? I'm looking for some kind of expression in terms of $L$ (like its length, or maximum value, etc.). I'm also wondering if there is some kind of algorithm which can generate a list with the most amount of iterations.","['elementary-set-theory', 'recreational-mathematics']"

4479360,Weighted count of Egyptian fraction representations,"This question emerged during an activity I ran for some middle school students a couple weeks ago; basically, it's about a way to ""count"" - with an appropriate kind of weight - the Egyptian fraction representations of a given rational. Let $[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathit{fin}}$ denote the set of finite sets of natural numbers. Given a positive rational $q$ , let $\mathsf{E}(q)=\{X\in[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathit{fin}}: q=\sum_{x\in X}{1\over x}\}$ be the set of Egyptian fraction representations (without duplication!) of $q$ . For example, $\mathsf{E}(1)$ contains both $\{1\}$ and $\{2,3,6\}$ , as well as infinitely many other finite sets. I'm interested in the function $$\mathscr{E}: q\mapsto \sum_{X\in \mathsf{E}(q)} \left( \prod_{x\in X}{1\over x}\right).$$ Intuitively, I'm trying to count the Egyptian fraction representations of $q$ ; of course this is infinite regardless of what $q$ is (since ${1\over n}={1\over n+1}+{1\over n^2+n}$ ), but I'm tweaking things to pay more attention to ""short"" representations with ""small"" denominators. In general, $\mathscr{E}$ 's behavior seems rather complicated. I have an outline of an argument that $\mathscr{E}(q)$ is indeed finite for all $q$ , but I'm not entirely certain it's correct; even if it is correct, anything more than that is unclear to me, including its behavior on specific values. So my two questions are: Question 1 : What is $\mathscr{E}(1)$ ? Of course we can trivially work out some lower bounds, e.g. $\mathscr{E}(1)>{37\over 36}$ , but I don't see a way to approach a good exact understanding. Question 2 : Is $\mathscr{E}(q)$ in fact finite for all $q\in\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ ? In general, I'm interested in any information about $\mathscr{E}$ , or indeed other ways to ""count"" Egyptian fraction representations. Most of the research I can find is about determining individual Egyptian fraction representations which are ""optimal"" in some sense (e.g. minimal length), which isn't exactly what I'm looking for.

Here is my attempt: Let $x\in X$ be any point, $f:U\to X$ an étale neighborhood, $y\in U$ and $f(y)=x$ . In particular $f$ is flat so $\mathcal{O}_x\to \mathcal{O}_y$ is flat. Since it is a local homomorphism of rings it is in fact faithfully flat (Matsumura, corollary to 4A). Now $\mathcal{F}_x\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x}\mathcal{O}_y=(f^*\mathcal{F})_y$ is free by assumption. It then follows that $\mathcal{F}_x$ is free $\mathcal{O}_x$ module (Matsumura 4E). This approach is not really good because I need $X$ noetherian to conclude that $\mathcal{F}$ is locally free.

The centers of the arcs are vertices of an equilateral triangle, all arcs have the same radius and span 60 degrees. (The center of the Reauleaux triangles are all at the origin) Basically, I want to remove the extra blank spaces in pictures like this by limiting the axes: To do that, I need to calculate the bounding box of any given Reuleaux triangle, but I don't know how to do that, and again, Google searching proved futile. I only know a very specific case, if the Reuleaux triangle is directly upwards (I don't know how to describe it in any natural language), like this: Then the left-most point is the left vertex, the right-most point is the right vertex, the top is the other vertex, and the lowest point is on the lowest arc halfway between the vertices, and the bounding box is a square. I know how to calculate the bounding box in this specific case, but I won't show the calculations here, for fear of over-cluttering the post. So how to calculate the bounding box of any Reuleaux triangle given the parameters above? I am trying to find the four coordinates of the square that is tangent to the Reuleaux triangle. For example, if the lowest side is parallel to the x axis, and the equilateral triangle has radius $r$ , then the three coordinates of the vertices are: $\begin{aligned}
(0&, r) \\
(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, - \frac{r} {2}) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, - \frac{r} {2})

(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r - \sqrt{3} r) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r - \sqrt{3} r) \\
(\frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r) \\
(- \frac{\sqrt{3} r} {2}&, r)
\end{aligned}$ I already worked all these out before I have written the post, and that's how I made the second picture.

This is called the expansion method . Now I have: $$H_{N_{nm}} = \langle \phi_n, H \phi_m\rangle = \mu_n\delta_{nm} + \langle \phi_n, V \phi_m\rangle$$ Alternatively, we can write this as $$H_N = P_N H ,\qquad P_N = \text{projection onto }\operatorname{span}(\phi_j)_{j=1}^N$$ Note that both $H$ and $H_N$ are self-adjoint.
