664741,"Prove that there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{(n)}$ has at least n+1 zeros on $(-1,1)$","Let $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$ such that $f(x)=0$ on $\mathbb{R}$\ $(-1,1)$. Prove that there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{(n)}$ has at least n+1 zeros on $(-1,1)$ My attempt : Assume $f$ is strictly positive  (if not n=0 works). Let $Z(f^{(n)})$ the number of zeros of $f^{(n)}$ on $(-1,1)$. Then we have:
$$
\forall n\in\mathbb{N}:\;f^{(n)}(-1)=f^{(n)}(1)=0
$$
so that iterating the Rolle theorem to the successive derivatives of f we have 
$$
 \;Z(f^{(k+1)}) \geq Z(f^{(k)}) +1
$$
thus, by induction :
$$
\forall n\in\mathbb{N}: \;Z(f^{(n+1)}) \geq Z(f^{(n)}) +1
$$
Therefore,
$$
Z(f^{(n)}) \geq n

664816,On the centralizers of $n$-cycles and conjugacy in $A_n$,"I'd appreciate comments on the validity of these attempted proofs.  Thanks. Let $a$ be an $n$-cycle in $S_n$. a) Show that the centralizer of $a$ in $S_n$ is $\langle a \rangle$. b) Assume that $n$ is odd.  Show that $A_n$ contains an $n$-cycle $b$ that is not conjugate to $a$ in $A_n$. a) Since the number of $k$-cycles in $S_n$ is given by $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k}$, the number of $n$-cycles in $S_n$ is $(n-1)!$.  Since two elements of $S_n$ are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type, $|\mathrm{cl}(a)|=(n-1)!$ (where $\mathrm{cl}(a)$ is the conjugacy class of $a$).  But $|\mathrm{cl}(a)|=|S_n:C_{S_n}(a)|$, or $|C_{S_n}(a)|=\frac{|S_n|}{|\mathrm{cl}(a)|}=\frac{n!}{(n-1)!}=n$.  Since $\langle a \rangle \le C_{S_n}(a)$, it follows that $\langle a \rangle = C_{S_n}(a)$. b) since $n$ is odd, all $n$-cycles are contained in $A_n$, so $A_n$ contains $(n-1)!\,\,$ $n$-cycles.  Since, for $a \in S_n$, $C_{A_n}(a)=C_{S_n}(a) \cap A_n = \langle a \rangle \cap A_n$, we have $|\mathrm{cl}_{A_n}(a)|=|A_n:C_{A_n}(a)|=\frac{\frac{1}{2}n!}{n}=\frac{n!}{2n}=\frac{1}{2}(n-1)!$, and so $a$ cannot be conjugate to all $(n-1)!$ $n$-cycles in $A_n$ and there exists such an element $b$.","['proof-verification', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

664838,Proving that $4n^2 - 1$ is divisible by 3.,"I apologise (apologize for my American friends :)) if I have overlooked something simple which I am sure is the case. Unnecessary background: This came up when trying to prove a related assertion (which for all intents and purposes is not needed for this question) and after trying a few cases it seemed that when multiplying any square number by $4$ the result was always one more than $3k$ . tl;dr tried stuff and noticed stuff :P Anyways, I am trying to prove that $4n^2 - 1$ is divisible by $3$ So I thought induction would be our weapon of choice. For n = 1, the case is trivial, as $4\times1^2 - 1 = 3 = 3\times 1$ Now, suppose $4n^2 - 1 = 3k$ then $4n^2 = 3k+1$ Now we prove for $n+1$ i.e. $4(n+1)^2 - 1 = 4n^2 +8n +3 $ but we know $4n^2 = 3k+1$ so $3k+8n+4$ should equal $3r$ But clearly it doesn't :/

664841,Coin toss with unknown probability – Bayesian interpretation,"I have observed a coin being tossed $n$ times. I do not know whether the coin is fair or not, but in every single toss I observed, the coin came up heads . What should my belief about $p$ (the probability that the coin shows heads ) be now? I cannot even say with certainty that $p>0$, since even an event with $p=0$ can occur. The frequency of heads is most compatible with $p=1$, but I doubt that is the best guess, especially if $n$ is low (it would be ridiculous to assume that $p=1$ after seeing a single heads only).

664920,K3 surfaces as complete intersections,"I'm following Beauville's book ""Complex Algebraic Surfaces"". If $S$ is a K3 surface and $C$ is a smooth not hyperelliptic curve of genus g, then we have a birational morphism $\phi : S\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^g$, whose restriction to $C$ is the canonical morphism $C\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$. Since $S$ is minimal, it is isomorphic to the surface $\phi(S)$. The hyperplane sections of $\phi(S)$ are the curves $H=\phi( C^\prime)$, with $C^\prime\in|C|$. $H^2=C^2=2g-2$. We have the exact sequence 
$$0 \rightarrow I \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P^g}}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}\rightarrow 0,$$
where $I$ is the ideal sheaf of $\phi(S)\subset\mathbb{P}^g$. From this we obtain also the exact sequence
$$0\rightarrow I(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)\rightarrow 0,$$
where $I(k)$ is the sheaf of polynomials of degree $k$ that vanish on $\phi(S)$. Using the cohomology sequence we have
$$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^g}(k))\leq h^0(I(k))+h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(k)).$$ If $g=4$, $\phi(S)$ has degree $6$ and we have
$$h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^4}(2))=15\,\,\,and\,\,\,h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\phi(S)}(2H))=14,$$ so $\phi(S)$ is contained in a quadric of $\mathbb{P}^4$.
Repeating the same argument with $k=3$, we obtain that $\phi(S)$ is contained also in a cubic.
Beauville then claims that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection surface $S_{2,3}\subset\mathbb{P}^4$. And i agree since they both have the same degree and $S_{2,3}$ is a K3 surface, but i think that maybe this is not enough as we see in the next example. He repeats the same argument with $g=5$ and he finds out that $\phi(S)$ it is contained in 3 quadrics that are linear independent in $\mathbb{P}^5$. This time he can't conclude that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}\subset\mathbb{P}^5$. Infact in this case, if $C$ admits a $g^1_3$ (i.e. an invertible sheaf $L$ of degree 3 such that $h^0(C,L)=2$), then $\phi(S)$ is not a complete intersection $S_{2,2,2}$ (exercise 11 of the same section of the book). But i see no difference with the $g=4$ case, infact $S_{2,2,2}$ is a K3 surface of degree $8$, like $\phi(S)$. I don't understand why in the case $g=4$ he can conclude all at once that $\phi(S)$ is a complete intersection $S_{2,3}$, since in the second case he can't.","['algebraic-geometry', 'k3-surfaces']"

$$P\left(\varepsilon_n = \pm 1\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$ According to Williams (Probability with Martingales (1991), Section 12.3 ""Random signs"", pp. 113-114), the results below show that i. $\sum \varepsilon_n a_n$ converges (a.s.) if and only if $\sum a_n^2 < \infty$, and that ii. $\sum \varepsilon_n a_n$ (a.s.) oscillates infinitely if $\sum a_n^2 = \infty$ I understand why (i) follows from the results below, but I don't see how to prove (ii).

$$P\left(\sum X_k\ \mathrm{converges}\right) = 0\ \mathrm{or}\ 1$$ The proof of part b given in the book shows in fact that if $\left(X_k\right)$ is a sequence of independent zero-mean RVs uniformly bounded by some constant $K$, then

665009,Finding the better coin: what is the probability of success?,"Just for fun, I'm working my way through Motwani and Raghavan's Randomized Algorithms textbook. As part of a solution to one of the problems they've posed, I've come across a probability problem I don't know how to solve: Suppose that you have two coins, one of which flips heads $\frac{2}{3}$ of the time and one of which flips heads $\frac{1}{3}$ of the time. You flip each coin $k$ times and guess which coin flips heads $\frac{2}{3}$ of the time by choosing the coin that flipped the most heads. (If there's a tie, assume that you guess incorrectly). What is the probability, as a function of $k$, that you choose the correct coin? To try to solve this, I tried to model the distributions of heads from the coins as two binomial distributions and then subtracting them to get a distribution on the difference between the good coin's number of heads and the bad coin's number of heads, but I couldn't make much progress because I don't know how to subtract these distributions.

665026,Adding Elements to Diagonal of Symmetric Matrix to Ensure Positive Definiteness.,"I have a symmetric matrix $A$, which has zeroes all along the diagonal i.e. $A_{ii}=0$. I cannot change the off diagonal elements of this matrix, I can only change the diagonal elements. I need this matrix to be positive definite. One way to ensure this is as follows: Let $\lambda'$ by the absolute value     of the most negative eigenvalue and transform $A\mapsto A + \lambda'I_{na}$. Notice this leaves the off-diagonal elements unchanged, but now it is positive definite: $(A+\lambda'I_{na})x_{i}=(\lambda_{i}+\lambda')x_{i}=\lambda_{i}^{new}x_{i}$, where $(x_{i},\lambda_{i})$ are an eigenpair. The eigenvalues of the new matrix formed by adding $\lambda'$ to the diagonal are all positive. I fear that this solution is sub-optimal - in my application I want to add only as much as I need to and no more. I would like to know if I can ensure positive definiteness by more generally performing $A+D$ where $D$ is some diagonal matrix. [Application: Statistics. $A$ is related to the covariance of some augmented data. I want it to be as small as possible so as to reduce the leverage of the missing data.

665046,On the hessian matrix and relative minima,"I'm asked to prove the following statement: Let $\mathbb{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ an open subset and $f: \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{R} / f \in \mathbb{C}^3 \wedge (P \in \mathbb{A} : \nabla f(P)=0)$. Suppose the hessian matrix of f is defined positive, prove that P is a strict relative minima of f. A similar proof has already been posted here , however, there is a difference and I'd like to know whether my approach is right. Approximating $f$ by its Taylor's polynomial of grade 2 centered on P, we get the following expression: $$f(x) = f(P) + \frac{1}{2} \langle H_f(P) \cdot (x-P), x-P \rangle + R(P) \cdot (x-P)$$ where $R(P) \cdot (x-P) = \frac{1}{6}\langle D^3_f(c) \cdot (x-P), x-P\rangle$, c being some point between x and p. By replacing $x$ with $P + tV$, $t \in \mathbb{R} \wedge V \in \mathbb{A}$, we get: $$f(P + tV) = f(P) + \frac{1}{2} \langle H_f(P) \cdot (tV), tV \rangle + R(P) \cdot (tV)$$ Thus, by taking $t$ as a common factor from the vector product in the second term, we get: $$f(P + tV) = f(P) + \frac{t^2}{2} \langle H_f(P) \cdot V, V \rangle + R(P) \cdot (tV)$$ By definition, P is a strict local minima iif $f(P) < f(P + tV)$ when $tV$ is sufficiently close to 0, hence replacing the equation we get: $$0 < \frac{t^2}{2} \langle H_f(P) \cdot V, V \rangle + R(P) \cdot (tV)$$ And since $\langle H_f(P) \cdot V, V \rangle$ is the quadratic form associated to $H_f(P)$, which by hypothesis is defined positive (therefore being higher than 0), we know that the first term is higher than 0. It is the second term I'm having trouble with: how can I prove that $R(P) \cdot (tV) \ll \frac{t^2}{2} \langle H_f(P) \cdot V, V \rangle$ and thus it can't make the statement false?.

I am familiar with definition of a field of fractions. For example, I understand that if one has an integral domain $D$, it can be embedded in a field of fractions $F_D$, and every element of $F_D$ can be written as the quotient of two elements in $D$. However I have been confused by two questions: (1) If one has a field $F$, and one can show that any element in $F$ can be expressed as the quotient of two elements in an integral domain $D$, does that imply that $F$ is the field of fractions of $D$? (i.e. Would it suffice in my case to show that every element in $\Bbb Q[i]$ can be written as a the quotient of 2 elements of $\Bbb Z[i]$?) (2) How can I show that element in $\Bbb Q[i]$ can be written as a the quotient of 2 elements of $\Bbb Z[i]$? When I write an element of $\Bbb Q[i]$ like $$q = \frac ab + \frac cdi$$ I get mixed up trying to come up with 2 elements of $\Bbb Z[i]$ that could equal that. I set $z = u+vi$ and $w = x+yi$, equate $q = z/w$ and I end up with these equations like this: $$a = ux + vy; b = x^2 + y^2; c = vx - uv; d = x^2 + y^2$$ This doesn't strike me as the way to go.

665365,Ways to induce a topology on power set?,"In this question , two potential topologies were proposed for the power set of a set $X$ with a topology $\mathcal T$ : one comprised of all sets of subsets of $X$ whose union was $\mathcal T$ -open, one comprised of all sets of subsets of $X$ whose intersection was $\mathcal T$ -open. I outlined a proof there that neither such construction need be a topology on $\mathcal P(X)$ in general. In fact, depending on how one interprets the intersection of the empty set, each will be a topology on $\mathcal P(X)$ if and only if $\mathcal T$ is the discrete topology on $X,$ in which case both are the discrete topology on $\mathcal P(X).$ This led me to wonder if there are any ways to induce a topology on $\mathcal P(X)$ from a topology on $X$ ? Some searching shows that one ""natural"" way to topologize $\mathcal P(X)$ is to give it the topology of pointwise convergence of indicator functions $X\to\{0,1\}.$ This is certainly very nice, but ignores the topology on $X,$ so I'm still curious: Are there any ways to induce a topology on $\mathcal P(X)$ from any given topology on $X$ ?

To directly add the summands together, we need a common denominator.  Let $R_n=\{0,\ldots, n\}$, $S=\{(i,j)\in R_n\times R_n |j<i\}$, and $S_k=\{(i,j)\in S | i=k\text{ or }j=k\}$.
First, note that
$$\begin{eqnarray*}\prod_{\substack{j=0\\  j\ne k}}^n\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}&=&
\prod_{\substack{j=0\\  j< k}}^n\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}\prod_{\substack{j=0\\  j> k}}^n\frac{1}{-(x_j-x_k)}\\&=&\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}\prod_{j=k+1}^n\frac{1}{-(x_j-x_k)}\\
&=&(-1)^{n-k}\prod_{(i,j)\in S_k}\frac{1}{x_i-x_j}

The proof I found is quite brief: Solution from [dbfin]: Since the functions $f: f(x) = x / (1 + x)$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous, $d'$ is continuous in $d$ and vice versa, which means the topologies are the same. I am quite confused about the condition of the Lemma (if $d: X' \times X' \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous) and therefore don't understand the details of the proof. My Problem: In order to show that the two topological spaces $X$ (induced by $d$) and $X’$ (induced by $d’$) are the same. We can show that (1) $X’$ is finer than $X$ and (2) $X$ is finer than $X’$. To prove the former one (the latter one goes similarly), using the lemma above, we shall first justify its premise (i.e., the “if ” part) $d : X’ \times X’ \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous. I don’t know how this is achieved in the [dbfin] solution. Could someone offer me more details? P.S.: The ""more standard"" approach without the lemma above is given by @Stromael. However, I have found a similar proof at this site after I posted this problem. To avoid duplication, in this post, I would prefer to the solution with the lemma.","['general-topology', 'alternative-proof', 'metric-spaces']"

665981,How did Beltrami show the consistency of hyperbolic geometry in his 1868 papers?,"This is in response to comments and the answer by user studiosus to this question : As for Beltrami's work: Consistency of a geometry from (post) Hilbert
  viewpoint has nothing to do with existence of an (isometric) embedding
  in a particular space. For instance, for a Riemannian manifold to
  exist, it suffices to define it via an atlas of charts together with a
  Riemannian metric tensor. What Beltrami did was to embed isometrically
  a proper open subset of the hyperbolic plane in $R^3$. Since a proper
  open subset of $H^2$ violates axioms of hyperbolic geometry (it is not
  homogeneous!), existence of such an embedding does not prove
  consistency of hyperbolic geometry. I have Stillwell's translation of Beltrami's papers with me and as I understand them, Beltrami in his first paper uses differential geometry to show that the surface of the pseudosphere admits hyperbolic two-dimensional geometry as described synthetically by Lobachevsky, in his second paper he generalizes the result of the first paper to other dimensions. Beltrami does not make claims about consistency (and especially not that hyperbolic geometry was ""as consistent"" as Euclidean geometry, since the latter was unquestioned at the time) but many authors claim that by showing that a surface in Euclidean space admits a part of the hyperbolic plane, Beltrami shows the consistency of hyperbolic geometry. For example: In the first of the two papers published that year Beltrami pointed
  out that the trigonometry of the geodesics of the pseudosphere [...]
  was identical with the trigonometry of the hyperbolic plane.
  Consequently any self-contradiction that might arise in hyperbolic
  geometry would of necessity also constitute a self-contradiction of
  Euclidean geometry. In other words, Beltrami proved that that
  hyperbolic geometry was just as consistent as Euclidean geometry. $-$ Saul Stahl, The Poincaré Half-plane: A Gateway to Modern Geometry I have seen many other authors make similar claims. Is this an incorrect interpretation? Can someone clarify?","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'geometry']"

I read a bit on the famous textbook Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision (pag. 226) but I couldn't be able to get a satisfactory result.
In detail I need to recover the K matrix with three unknowns: focal length f , u and v . It can be considered as a simplified case where K has the form:
$$
K = \begin{bmatrix}f & 0 & u\\0 & f & v\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$
I start from three vanishing points in pixel coordinates, calculated as the intersections of three sets of parallel lines. They are in the form:
$$
V_1 = \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1\\1\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}212\\2138\\1\end{bmatrix},
V_2 = \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2\\1\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}-49\\42\\1\end{bmatrix},
V_3 = \begin{bmatrix}x_3\\y_3\\1\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}1105\\146\\1\end{bmatrix}
$$ The author suggests to consider this matrix $\omega$: $$
\omega = \begin{bmatrix}\omega_1 & 0 & \omega_2\\0 & \omega_1 & \omega_3\\\omega_2 & \omega_3 & \omega_4\end{bmatrix}
$$
and recover its values by the orthogonality property of vanishing points, stacking three equations as constraints: $$V_1^T*\omega *V_2=0$$ $$V_1^T*\omega *V_3=0$$ $$V_3^T*\omega *V_2=0$$
This will generate a linear matrix equation of the form $A_{3,4} * \omega_{4,1} = 0_{3,1}$. Then $\omega$ can be calculated as the nullspace of $A$. Finally $K$ can be recovered by a Cholesky factorization as $\omega = (KK^T)^{-1}$. Here my $\omega$ matrix:
$$
\omega = \begin{bmatrix}1.6372\cdot 10^{-6} & 0 & -6.2870\cdot 10^{-4}
\\0 & 1.6372\cdot 10^{-6} & -4.7153\cdot 10^{-4}\\-6.2870\cdot 10^{-4} & -4.7153\cdot 10^{-4} & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$
which gives me K = chol(inv(w)); $$
K = \begin{bmatrix}921 & 193 & 0.970\\ 0 & 841 & 0.396 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}

666333,Groups of order $pq$ have a proper normal subgroup,"I am doing the following exercise from [Birkhoff and MacLane, A survey of modern algebra]: Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$ ($p,q$ primes).  Show that either $G$ is cyclic or contains an element of order $p$ (or $q$).  In the second case, show that $G$ contains either $1$ normal or $q$ conjugate subgroups of order $p$.  In the latter case the $pq-(p-1)q=q$ elements not of order $p$ form a normal subgroup.  Infer that $G$ always has a proper normal subgroup. I think I was able to prove $G$ has a proper normal subgroup, but without quite establishing that the number of subgroups of order $p$ is 1 or $q$. Here is my solution: Suppose $G$ is cyclic and $G=\langle x \rangle$.  Then, $\langle x^p \rangle$ has order $q$ and is normal, so we are done.  So suppose $G$ is not cyclic.  Let $x \in G-1$.  By Lagrange's theorem, the order of $x$ is $p$, say.  Let $H:=\langle x \rangle$.  $G$ acts on all subgroups of order $p$ by conjugation.  In this action, the stabilizer of $H$ is the normalizer $N_G(H)$.  Since $N_G(H) \supseteq H$, $|N_G(H)|$ equals $p$ or $qp$.  Hence the orbit containing $H$ has length $q$ or 1 (by the orbit-stabilizer lemma).  If this value is 1, then $H$ is normal, so we are done.  If this value is $q$, then there are $pq-(p-1)q=q$ remaining nonidentity elements in $G$ that are not in any conjugate of $H$. Case 1: If any of these $q$ elements, say some $y \in G$, has order $p$, then $K:=\langle y \rangle$ is either normal (so we are done) or has $q$ conjugate subgroups (in which case the conjugates of $H$ and of $K$ together contain $q(p-1)+q(p-1)+1>qp$ elements, a contradiction). Case 2:  If none of the $q$ elements has order $p$, then they all have order 1 or $q$, and hence form a cyclic subgroup $K$ of order $q$.  $K$ must be normal, since otherwise $g^{-1}Kg \ne K$ for some $g \in G$, whereas $K$ already exhausted all the elements of $G$ of order $q$. Thus, $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $p$ or $q$. While I have shown the group is not simple, I think I haven't shown yet that the number of subgroups of order $p$ is 1 or $q$.  The proof only establishes that the number of distinct conjugates of $H$ is 1 or $q$.

This means, that $a_{251} \equiv_{{}\bmod 2008} a$, right? It's obvious if $a\mid 2008$. In the other case I'm totally at a loss. I thought about using Euler totient function but that's obviously doesn't apply here, since $2008$ is not prime.","['modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
666359,Localization of an additive category which is no longer additive,"Is there a nice example of an additive category $C$ and a family of morphisms $S\subset Mor(C)$ such that $C[S^{-1}]$ is no longer additive? I know that in general localization of categories behaves badly (see examples here , Wayback Machine ), but I haven't seen an example of $C[S^{-1}]$ not being even additive. Also, it is known that if $S$ satisfies Ore conditions, then the localization $C[S^{-1}]$ will be additive, and the localization functor $Q\colon C\to C[S^{-1}]$ will also be additive. So one should search for required examples among ones where $S$ is not Ore. Thank you very much for your help!","['homological-algebra', 'category-theory', 'examples-counterexamples', 'abstract-algebra']"
