1072206,"What does ""removing a point"" have to do with homeomorphisms?","I am self-studying topology from Munkres.  One exercise asks, in part, to show that the spaces $(0,1)$ and $(0,1]$ are not homeomorphic.  An apparent solution is as follows: If you remove a point, $x$, from $(0,1)$, you get a disconnected space; however, you can remove the point $\{1\}$ from the space $(0,1]$ and the space will still be connected.  This apparently means the spaces aren't homeomorphic. I don't quite see the connection to the definition of homeomorphic spaces (that two spaces are homeomorphic if there is a bicontinuous function between them).   So, what is the connection between the ""bicontinuous"" definition of homeomorphisms and the ""removing a point"" procedure?  Sorry for missing something obvious.",['general-topology']
1072208,Functional Derivative (Gateaux variation) of functional with convolution,"I have the  following functional \begin{align*}
F[f]=\int f(x) \log(g(x)) dx
\end{align*} where $g(x)$ is given by convolution $g(x)=y(x) * f(x)=\int y(\tau) f(x-\tau) d\tau$ , so \begin{align*}
F[f]&=\int f(x) \log(g(x)) dx=F[f]=\int f(x) \log(y(x) * f(x)) dx\\
&=\int f(x) \log \left(\int y(\tau) f(x-\tau) d\tau \right) dx
\end{align*} assume that $y(x)$ is fixed. My Goal is to find functional derivative or Gateaux derivative with respect to $f$ . My issue is that I don't know how to deal with convolution when I take the derivative. What I did The variation is given by $\left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} F[f+\epsilon \theta] \right]_{\epsilon=0}
$ . My question is do I work with the convolution term or no? Here are the two possibilities 1) Don't work with the convolution term \begin{align*}
\left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} F[f+\epsilon \theta(x)] \right]_{\epsilon=0}
=\left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int (f(x)+\epsilon \theta(x)) \log(g(x)) dx \right]_{\epsilon=0}=
\int \theta \log(g(x)) dx
\end{align*} 2) Work with the convolution term \begin{align*}
\left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} F[f+\epsilon \theta] \right]_{\epsilon=0}
=\left[ \frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int (f(x)+\epsilon \theta(x)) \log \left(\int y(\tau) (f(x-\tau)+\epsilon \theta(\tau)) d\tau \right) dx \right]_{\epsilon=0}
\end{align*} In the integral inside convolution should it be $\theta(\tau)$ of $\theta(x)$ ?? Which way is correct? if the second way is correct how do I proceed next? I was also thinking about using chain rule of derivatives for functional \begin{align*}
\frac{\delta F[G[f]]}{\delta f}=\frac{\delta F[G[f]]}{\delta G}\frac{\delta G[f]}{\delta f}
\end{align*} but I don't think convolution is a functional, so I am not sure if this applies.

1072320,Is my understanding for group algebra correct?,"Let $G$ be a group, $k$ be a commutative unital ring. Consider $\mathbf{Alg}_k^{inv}$ the category of unital $k$-algebras whose multiplicative semigroup is a group. Then there is a forgetful functor

This functor has a right adjoint $$K:\mathbf{Grp}\to \mathbf{Alg}_k^{inv}$$ which assigns to each group its group algebra. One can see this by observing that the group homomorphism $G\to U(k[G])$ is initial in the comma category $G\to U(\mathbf{Alg}_k^{inv})$ and thus is a unit.

We also assume that every term in the sequence $\{y_n\}$ is an upper bound for $E$. Show that $y$ is an upper bound for $E$. My reasoning First since the sequence $\{x_n\}$ is inside of E, that means that every term of the sequence must be an element of the set E. Since all terms in the sequence $\{y_n\}$ are upper bounds for the set $E$, then this means that $\{x_n\} \leq \{y_n\}$ for all $n$. I'm really stuck though.

1072844,How many non-rational complex numbers $x$ have the property that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational?,"In this answer , I proved the following statement: For each positive integer $n$ , there are finitely many non-rational complex numbers $x$ such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. These complex numbers all have the form $$x(a,b)=\frac{\zeta^b-\zeta^a}{1- \zeta^b},$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive $n$ th root of unity and $a,b$ are different nonzero elements of $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ . However, a search with a computer suggests that there are even finitely many such complex numbers over all $n$ . I have counted $26$ of them. Let $S_n$ be the set of non-rational complex numbers such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. Since $x^{nm}$ and $(x+1)^{mn}$ are rational if $x^n$ and $(1+x)^n$ are,  it follows that $S_n \subseteq S_{nm}$ . Let $S= \varinjlim S_{n!}$ . This is the set of all non-rational complex numbers $x$ for which there exists an $n$ such that $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational. Question: Is $S$ finite? I have checked with a computer that $$S_{12}=S_{4!} = S_{5!}=S_{6!}$$ and that $S_n \subseteq S_{12}$ for $n<100$ . Question Is $S=S_{12}$ ? In other words, if $x^n$ and $(x+1)^n$ are rational, is it true that $x^{12}$ and $(x+1)^{12}$ are rational? Micah has remarked in a comment to David's answer that any $s \in S$ must be a quadratic irrational. So, the finiteness of $S$ would follow if one could prove that finitely many numbers of the form $x(a,b)$ are quadratic irrationals. In order for this to be true, it must be that $x(a,b)^{\sigma^2} = x(a,b)$ for any $\sigma \in \text{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\zeta)/\mathbb Q) = (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times$ . This means that we must have $$\frac{\zeta^{c^2b}-\zeta^{c^2a}}{1- \zeta^{c^2b}} = \frac{\zeta^b-\zeta^a}{1- \zeta^b}$$ for any $c \in (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times$ .

Here is my work: If $\psi$ was exact there would exist $f:\mathbb R^2 \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb R$ such that $df = f_x dx + f_y dy = \psi$ . Here $f_x = {-y \over x^2 + y^2}$ and $f_y = {x \over x^2 + y^2}$ . It would hold true that $$\int f_x dx = \int f_y dy = f.$$ So I calculate these integrals: $$ \int f_x dx = -{1\over 2}\log(x^2 + y^2)$$ and $$ \int f_y dy = {1\over 2}\log(x^2 + y^2)$$ It is clear that these cannot be equal therefore $\psi$ is not exact.

1072886,The cone of a topological space is contractible and simply connected,"I would like help in verifying my proof and making it rigorous. Question: Let $X$ be a topological space. The cone on $X$ , denoted $CX$ , is the quotient space $(X × [0, 1])/(X × \{0\})$ .  Prove that $CX$ is contractible and simply connected? (note: $X/A$ is the quotient space $X/\mathord{∼}$ for an equivalence relation $∼$ on $X$ such that the equivalence classes are $A$ itself, and the singletons $\{x\}$ such that $x \notin A$ .) My Answer: A previous answer by kobe shows that $CX$ is contractible: Consider the map $H: X \times [0,1] \times [0,1] → X \times [0,1]$ defined by $H((x,t),s) = (x(1-s)t)$ . Then $H$ is continuous and $H((x,0,s) = (x,0)$ for all $x∈X$ and $s∈[0,1]$ . $H$ induces a continuous map $\hat{H}$ : $CX \times [0,1] → CX$ such that $\hat{H}([(x,t)],s) = [(x,(1-s)t)]$ .  Now $\hat{H}[(x,t)],0) = [(x,t)]$ and $\hat{H}[(x,t)],1) = [(x,0)] = X \times \{0\}$ . So $\hat{H}$ is a homotopy in $CX$ from the identity on $CX$ to the point $X \times \{0\}$ .  Consequently, $CX$ is contractible. $CX$ is simply connected as a result of being contractible.  To show this, we show that all contractible spaces are simply connected.  Let $X$ by contractible.  We will show that any loop in $X$ is homotopic, relative to $\{ 0,1 \}$ , to the constant loop.  Observe that the homotopy $F$ from the identity on $X$ to the constant map at $x∈X$ gives us a homotopy $G(s,t) = F(α(s),t)$ from any loop $α$ based at $x$ to the constant loop at $x$ .  We must show that the homotopy is relative to $\{0,1\}$ . We use the fact that the square $[0,1] \times[0,1]$ is convex, so there is a straight line homotopy $H$ between any two paths from $a$ to $b$ in $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ , and so any two such paths are homotopic relative to $\{0,1\}$ .  Using this, we see that the path along the left edge of the square is homotopic, relative to $\{0,1\}$ , to the path along the bottom edge, up the right edge and back along the top edge of the square.  Composing the homotopies $H$ and $G$ gives us the homotopy relative to $\{0,1\}$ .  We have shown that any loop in $X$ is homotopic, relative to $\{0,1\}$ , to the constant loop and so it is path connected and the fundamental group $π_1(X,b)$ for a loop based at $b$ has only one element and $π_1(X,b) = \{e\}$ where $e$ is a constant. $X$ is path-connected and has a trivial fundamental group.  Then it is simply connected.  Contractible spaces are simply connected.  Then $CX$ is simply connected.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'proof-verification']"

We are given 3 for one odds, that is if we bet 1 dollar and win then we will win $3. The betting strategy is as follows: we bet $\frac{1}{2}$ of current wealth that $X = 1$, $\frac{1}{4}$ of wealth that $X = 2$, and $\frac{1}{4}$ of wealth that $X = 3$.
So our winning after n rounds is
$$V_n = 3 V_{n-1} p(X_n).$$ Now find $\lim_n V_{n}$. Attempted Solution So I take the expected value of $V_n$ for all n and then take the expected value to the limit: $$E[V_n] = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-k}\left(\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{2}\right)^{k} = \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^n$$ And $\left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^n \rightarrow^n \infty$. Confusion However, the counter argument to the solution is that we have taken then limit of an expectation, when in fact, I need to the expectation of the limit. And by Fatou's lemma $$\lim inf E[V_n] \ge E[\lim inf V_n]$$ So I found an upper bound that diverges and therefore cannot conclude anything about $V_n$. Please explain the subtleties here? Alternate Solution Now consider this alternate solution and please explain why it makes sense relative to Fatou's lemma. Define $\log := \log_2$. And note $$V_n = 3^n V_o  P(X_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot P(X_n)$$ So let $V_o = 1$ and we have: $$2^{\log V_n} = 2^{n \log 3 + \log V_o + \log P(X_1) + \ldots + \log P(X_n)}$$ And by LLN $\log P(X_1) + \ldots + \log P(X_n) \rightarrow^n n E[\log(X_j)] = n \left(\frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{4} \right)$.

I suppose, that $t_1$ is uniformly distributed on the interval [0,2]. You get a ticket, if your parking time $t_2$ is longer than $4h-t_1$, so I have to compute the probability

1073181,Grading system with multiple judges,"This is a practical question, I'm not sure if it's on-topic here. So sorry if it's not. There is a competition where judges decide the score competitors by summing their performance mark in several aspects, and different competitors might be graded by different sets of judges. E.g. There are competitors A,B and Judges 1~3. A is graded by J1 and J2, B is graded by J1 and J3. But the judges is not professionally trained so the cardinal value of the score might not be comparable with each other. For example, J1 might prefer to give a score between 2~4, J2 between 1~5, and J3 between 3~5. How should I adjust the scores so that the average score reflect the truth strength of the competitors? My thoughts: (1) Naive ranking: If J1 grades $n_1$ competitors, then the $k$-th highest scorer gets $k/n_1$ points (2) Normalized ranking: Normalize $\{k/n_1\}$. (3) Normalized score: Normalize the score given by each judge. But they have their advantages and disadvantages.

I als considered switching to $u=A(x)$ as my independent variable, but that also didn't help me that much ...","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

1073579,Composition of a Dirac delta and a function in higher dimensions [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Property of Dirac delta function in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (3 answers) Closed 2 years ago . Coming from a physics background, I was taught the formula for the composition of a Dirac delta and a function. Indeed, if we consider a nice function $ f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $, one can write
$$
\delta_{\rm D} (f(x)) = \sum_{x_{0} \in \mathcal{Z}_{f}} \frac{\delta_{\rm D} (x \!-\! x_{0})}{|f'(x_{0})|} \, ,
$$
where ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ x_{0} \,|\, f(x_{0}) = 0 \} }$ is the set of all the zeroes of $f$, and where we assumed that all the zeroes of $f$ are simple, so that ${f'(x_{0}) \neq 0}$. My question is now related to what would happen in higher dimensions. (Such formulas are often encountered in kinetic theory). Let's assume I want to compute the double integral
$$
I = \iint dx \, dy \, \delta_{\rm D} (f (x,y)) \, g(x,y) \, , 
$$ My questions are then the following ones : Let's assume that $f(x,y) = f(x)$, so that $y$ is absent from the Dirac delta. Provided that the zeroes of $f$ are simple, do we have ?
$$
I = \sum_{x_{0} \in \mathcal{Z}{f}} \frac{1}{|f'(x_{0})|} \int dy \, g(x_{0} , y)
$$ Let's assume that the set ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ (x_{0},y_{0}) \,|\, f(x_{0},y_{0}) \} }$ is made of isolated points . Can we compute $I$ ? If yes, how can it be done ? Let's assume that the set ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ (x_{0},y_{0}) \,|\, f(x_{0},y_{0}) \} }$ can be parametrized under the form ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ (x(\lambda),y(\lambda)) \,|\, \lambda \in \mathbb{R} \} }$, i.e. the zeroes of ${ f(x,y) }$ are along a given nice curve in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Is it possible to compute $I$ ? Let's assume that the set ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ (x_{0},y_{0}) \,|\, f(x_{0},y_{0}) \} }$ is even more filled than a line, so that the zeroes of $f$ constitute a closed region of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of non-zero volume . (I am not sure of the best way to phrase it...) For example, ${ \mathcal{Z}_{f} = \{ (x_{0},y_{0}) \,|\, x_{0}^{2} \!+\! y_{0}^{2} \leq 1 \} }$. Does the double integral $I$ have a meaning ? Finally, are there any other sorts of others $\mathcal{Z}_{f}$ for which the integral $I$ could have a meaning and be computed ?","['dirac-delta', 'integration', 'analysis']"
1073582,Project Motorola: setting up and solving an equation,"Stuck on a homework project in a highschool college algebra question.  I'm given the following information: Tact time is the average time to pick and place one part.  Throughput is the number of boards per hour, or placements per hour.  Variables include: $n$ : The number of boards per hour $p$ : The number of parts per board $C$ : The tact time $L$ : The load-unload time $M$ : The mark reading time Throughput is calculated by: $$TH(n) = \frac{n}{Cnp+L+M}$$ Setting: $C=0.2 \mbox{ seconds}$ , $L=5 \mbox{ seconds}$ , $M=1 \mbox{ second}$ , and $p=50 \mbox{ parts per board}$ , I get the equation $$TH(n) = \frac{n}{(10n+6)}$$ I'm supposed to find out the minimum number of boards per panel ( $n$ ) that will allow me to have a $TH(n)$ of at least $300$ .  So I've set $$300=\frac{n}{(10n+6)}$$ and tried to solve for $n$ .  I get $-0.6002$ .  This just doesn't make sense to me, that is, having a negative answer for a throughput time seems odd to me.  Looking at the equation, and graphing, it seems there is a limit of throughtput of $1/10$ ...which again looks suspect.  Pretty much nothing about this scenario makes sense to me as throughput, from that equation, seems to always be less than $1/10$ .

1073589,Groups of Order 12 aren't Simple,"Suppose $G$ is a group of order $12=2^2*3$. Let $n_p$ denote the number of Sylow p subgroups. Then $n_2$ is 1 or 3 and $n_3$ is 1 or 4. I want to show that one of them is one since if that is the case I can conclude that we have a normal subgroup, in which case $G$ is not simple. For the purpose of arriving at a contradiction, suppose $n_2=3,n_3=4$. I am not sure how to proceed. I was told that this implies that $G$ has 9 elements of order 2 or 4 and 8 elements of order 3, but how does one conclude that? I would just conclude that $G$ has 3 elements of order 2 and 4 elements of order 3.","['sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra']"
