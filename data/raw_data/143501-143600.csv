2332760,Every Topological Vector Space is Regular,"Let $V$ be an abstract ( $T_0$ ) topological vector space over topological field $K$ (We may assume that $K = \mathbb{C}$ or $K = \mathbb{R}$ for simplicity). This means that the only thing that we are allowed to use is that scalar multiplication and  addition are jointly continuous in both arguments (and also the $T_0$ properties).
The problem is to prove: For each point $x$ and closed set $Y$ such that $x \not \in Y$ there are exist disjoint open neighborhoods $O$ and $O'$ such that $x \in O$ and $Y \subset O'$ . I will write in the sequel for such sets $O \in \mathcal{U}_V(x),O' \in \mathcal{U}_V(Y)$ . If $U \in \mathcal{U}_V(y)$ then we can squeeze it by factor of $r \in K$ $$
 r \ast_y U = \big(rU + \{(1 - r)y\}\big) \cap U
$$ which is open neighborhood of $y$ . Proof may start with : for all $y \in Y$ there must exist $U_y \in \mathcal{U}_V(y)$ such that $x \not \in U_y$ , otherwise $x \in \lim_{n \to \infty} y $ and so $x \in Y$ which is not true. Then, $U = \bigcup_{y \in Y} U_y \in \mathcal{U}_V(Y)$ do not contain $x$ . In case $x \not \in \delta U$ just let $O' = U$ . Otherwise,  squeeze all open sets by some values $r_y$ : $$
O' =  \bigcup_{y \in Y} r_y \ast_y U_y
$$ Then $O = \Big(\overline{O'}\Big)^\complement$ . How to select $r_y$ ? Will this approach work?","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'separation-axioms']"
2332765,Exterior Algebra Graded Ring Structure?,"In Hatcher's Example 3.13 he defines the Exterior Algebra $\Lambda_R[\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n]$ over a commutative ring $R$ with identity to be the free $R$-module with basis the finite products $\alpha_{i_1}\cdots\alpha_{i_k}$ with $i_1 < \cdots <i_k$ with associative, distributive multiplication defined by the rules $\alpha_i \alpha_j = -\alpha_j \alpha_i$ and $\alpha_i^2=0$, and the empty product serving as the multiplicative identity. He then simply says that the exterior algebra becomes a commutative graded ring by specifying odd dimensions for the generators $\alpha_i$. I understand the $\alpha_i$ need to have odd dimensions in order to satisfy the $\alpha_i \alpha_j = -\alpha_j \alpha_i$, but how exactly does the exterior algebra decompose as a direct sum, which is part of the definition of a graded algebra?","['abstract-algebra', 'graded-rings', 'exterior-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"
2332766,Which subject are these students best? (basic high school statistical question),"It's a very basic high school statistical question, but I'm struggling to solve it. Suppose I have a school with $287$ students and each one made a test with $50$ questions (multiple choice questions with $5$ items each, they have to choose one item in each question). These questions are divided into the following subjects: Subject A - $8$ questions Subject B - $6$ questions Subject C - $10$ questions Subject D - $6$ questions Subject E - $6$ questions Subject F - $14$ questions We say a student fail the test when he doesn't solve any question. Then we have the following result: Subject A - $3$ students failed Subject B - $16$ students failed Subject C - $1$ students failed Subject D - $1$ students failed Subject E - $8$ students failed Subject F - $0$ students failed So how can I compare the performance of the students? In another words, which subject were they best and which one were they worse? Remark: Each student has only two options: successful or failure, so in this case the overall score in each subject is not important.",['statistics']

2332937,Area of surface using polar coordinates,"Calculate the area of the surface $z=x+y$ that is inside the cylinder $x^2+y^4 = 4$. I was able to find the correct answer by calculating the normal vector (using cross product) at each point on the surface parametrized:
$$
\vec{n} = (-r)\vec{i}+(-r)\vec{j}+(r)\vec{k}

And then I used polar coordinates to integrate the domain of the parametrized surface:
$$
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 ||\vec{n}|| \text{ } dr \text{ } d\theta = \sqrt{3}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2  r\text{ } dr \text{ } d\theta = 4\pi\sqrt{3}
$$
But after that I was asking myself why changing $drd\theta$ to the infinetesimal element of area $r dr d\theta$ is not giving me the correct answer. If I do that, I'll get my integral to be:
$$
\sqrt{3}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2  r^2\text{ } dr \text{ } d\theta \neq 4\pi\sqrt{3}

2333056,How to solve this question using the comparison test,"The problem is this
$$ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{x^2+1}\,dx $$ You're supposed to find if this converges or diverges. Now you could figure that by solving the integral but if we were supposed to use the comparison test, how would this be solved? My teacher taught me to use the comparison test like so: First change the original equation into something simple that can be solved by inspection. And so I turned the original equation into$$ \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x}\,dx $$which shows that it's divergent due to the P-Test. Then, based on that information, find an equation bigger or smaller than the original one, and do the test. So since it's divergent, we'd need a bigger equation and I thought of letting that equation be $ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{x^2+x}\,dx $ (basically just replaced the 1 with an x) and then turn it into the equation above. However there's one problem. The above equation is only smaller than the original equation after $x=1$ and the integral starts at 0. So this is incorrect right? How would I go about solving this? And is my idea of using the comparison test correct? Thanks!","['integration', 'definite-integrals']"
2333094,Determining isometry group of symmetric spaces,"I am learning some symmetric spaces, and I tried to look at some example, including Grassmannian (say, $p$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^{p+q}$) and the projective space $\mathbb{CP}^n$. I follow Helgason, therefore I wish to describe them in terms of Lie groups. My problem is: How to determine the isometry group of a manifold whose geometric description is known? Let me elaborate more. For $\mathbb{CP}^n$, I understand that the special unitary group $SU(n+1)$ acts transitively on it. Also, I know the isotropy group for a certain point is $U(n)$. It is tempting now to claim $\mathbb{CP}^n = SU(n+1)/U(n)$. But I have not checked that $SU(n+1)$ is the isometry group! Similar problems arise when I try Grassmannians, Lagrangian Grassmannians, Orthogonal Grassmannians, etc. I usually can find a group acting well on these spaces but I cannot determine whether that group is the isometry group.

2333100,"Theorem 6.17 in Baby Rudin, 3rd ed: $\int_a^b f \,d\alpha = \int_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,dx$","Here is Theorem 6.17 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition: Assume $\alpha$ increases monotonically and $\alpha^\prime \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a, b]$ . Let $f$ be a bounded real function on $[a, b]$ . Then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ if and only if $f\alpha^\prime \in \mathscr{R}$ . In that case $$ \int_a^b f \,d\alpha = \int_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x)\, dx. $$ For terminology, here is the link to my post here on Math SE on Theorem 6.15 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition. Here is Rudin's proof of Theorem 6.17: Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given and apply Theorem 6.6 to $\alpha^\prime$ : There is a partition $P = \left\{ \ x_0, \ldots, x_n \  \right\}$ of $[a, b]$ such that $$ \tag{28} U(P, \alpha^\prime) - L(P, \alpha^\prime) < \varepsilon. $$ The mean value theorem furnishes points $t_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ such that $$ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \Delta x_i $$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . If $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , then $$ \tag{29}  \sum_{i=1}^n \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta x_i < \varepsilon, $$ by (28) and Theorem 6.7 (b). Put $M = \sup \lvert f(x) \rvert$ . Since $$ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i = \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \Delta x_i $$ it follows from (29) that $$ \tag{30}  \left\lvert  \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i  -  \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i \right\rvert \leq M \varepsilon. $$ In particular, $$  \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i  \leq U( P, f \alpha^\prime ) + M \varepsilon, $$ for all choices of $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , so that $$ U(P, f, \alpha) \leq U(P, f \alpha^\prime) + M \varepsilon. $$ The same argument leads from (30) to $$ U(P, f \alpha^\prime) \leq U(P, f, \alpha) + M \varepsilon. $$ Thus $$ \tag{31} \left\lvert U(P, f, \alpha) - U(P, f \alpha^\prime ) \right\rvert \leq M \varepsilon. $$ Now note that (28) remains true if $P$ is replaced by any refinement. Hence (31) also remains true. We conclude that $$ \left\lvert \overline{\int}_a^b f \, d \alpha - \overline{\int}_a^b f (x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,dx  \right\rvert \leq M \varepsilon. $$ But $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary. Hence $$ \tag{32} \overline{\int}_a^b f \,d \alpha = \overline{\int}_a^b f (x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,dx  $$ for any bounded $f$ . The equality of the lower integrals follows from (30) in exactly the same way. The theorem follows. Here is Theorem 6.6 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ such that $$ \tag{13} U(P, f, \alpha ) - L(P, f, \alpha ) < \varepsilon. $$ Here is Theorem 6.7: Theorem 6. 7(a): If (13) holda for some $P$ and some $\varepsilon$ , then (13) holds (with the same $\varepsilon$ ) for every refinement of $P$ . Theorem 6. 7(b): If (13) holds for $P = \left\{ \ x_0, \ldots, x_n \ \right\}$ and if $s_i$ , $t_i$ are arbitrary points in $\left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , then $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left\lvert f \left( s_i \right) - f \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta \alpha_i < \varepsilon. $$ Theorem 6.7(c): If $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and the hypotheses of (b) hold, then $$ \left\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( t_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i - \int_a^b f\, d \alpha \right\rvert < \varepsilon. $$ Now here is my understanding of Rudin's proof of Theorem 6.17: As $f$ is a bounded real function on $[a, b]$ , so there is a positive real number $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $$ \lvert f(x) \rvert < M \tag{0} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ . Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be a given real number. As $\alpha^\prime$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$ , so there exists a partition $P = \left\{ \ x_0, \ldots, x_n \ \right\}$ of $[a, b]$ such that $$ U(P, \alpha^\prime) - L(P, \alpha^\prime) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2M}. \tag{1} $$ Now as $\alpha^\prime$ exists on $[a, b]$ , so,  For each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ , the function $\alpha$ is continuous on $\left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ and differentiable on $\left( x_{i-1}, x_i \right)$ , and hence  there exists a point $t_i \in \left( x_{i-1}, x_i \right)$ such that $$  \alpha \left( x_i \right) - \alpha \left( x_{i-1} \right) = \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right); $$ that is, $$ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \Delta x_i \tag{2} $$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . And, for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ , if $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , then, as $t_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ also, so we conclude that $$\tag{3a} m_i ( \alpha^\prime )  \leq \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \leq M_i (\alpha^\prime), $$ and $$\tag{3b}  m_i (\alpha^\prime) \leq \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \leq M_i ( \alpha^\prime) ,  $$ where $$ m_i ( \alpha^\prime ) \colon=  \inf \left\{ \ \alpha^\prime (x) \ \colon \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i \ \right\}, $$ and $$ M_i ( \alpha^\prime) \colon= \sup  \left\{ \ \alpha^\prime (x) \ \colon \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i \ \right\};$$ now (3b) implies that $$ \tag{3c} - M_i ( \alpha^\prime ) \leq - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \leq - m_i (\alpha^\prime),  $$ and upon adding (3c) to (3a), we obtain $$ m_i ( \alpha^\prime ) - M_i( \alpha^\prime) \leq \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \leq M_i ( \alpha^\prime) - m_i( \alpha^\prime),   $$ which implies that $$ \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \leq M_i ( \alpha^\prime) - m_i( \alpha^\prime),  \tag{3d} $$ and, as $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1} \geq 0$ , so (3d) yields $$ \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta x_i \leq \left[ M_i ( \alpha^\prime) - m_i( \alpha^\prime) \right] \Delta x_i,  \tag{3e} $$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . Now upon adding together all the inequalities in (3e), we get $$ \sum_{i=1}^n  \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta x_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ M_i ( \alpha^\prime) - m_i( \alpha^\prime) \right] \Delta x_i,  $$ that is, $$ \sum_{i=1}^n  \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta x_i \leq U(P, \alpha^\prime) - L(P, \alpha^\prime). \tag{3} $$ From (1) and (3) we get $$ \sum_{i=1}^n  \left\lvert \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) - \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \right\rvert \Delta x_i < \frac{\varepsilon}{2M}, \tag{4} $$ for any points $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ ; the points $t_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ are as given in (2) above. Now from (2) we see that $$ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i = \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \Delta x_i, \tag{5a} $$ where the points $s_i$ and $t_i$ , for each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ , are as in (4) above. So \begin{align} 
& \ \ \ \left\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i  \right\rvert \\ 
&= \left\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right) \Delta x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i  \right\rvert \\
& \qquad \qquad \mbox{ [ by (5a) ] } \\
&= \left\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \left[ \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right)  - \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \right] \Delta x_i  \right\rvert \\
&\leq \sum_{i=1}^n \left\lvert  f \left( s_i \right) \left[ \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right)  - \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \right] \Delta x_i  \right\rvert \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \left\lvert  f \left( s_i \right)  \right\rvert  \left\lvert  \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right)  - \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right)  \right\rvert \Delta x_i   \\
&\leq \sum_{i=1}^n M \left\lvert  \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right)  - \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right)  \right\rvert \Delta x_i   \\
& \qquad \qquad \mbox{ [ using (0) above ] } \\
&= M \sum_{i=1}^n  \left\lvert  \alpha^\prime \left( t_i \right)  - \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right)  \right\rvert \Delta x_i   \\
&< M \frac{\varepsilon}{2M} \qquad \mbox{ [ using (4) above ] } \\
&= \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.   
\end{align} Thus we have shown that $$ \left\lvert \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i  \right\rvert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{5} $$ for any points $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ . From (5) we can conclude that, for any points $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , for each $i \in \{  1, \ldots, n\}$ , we have $$ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, $$ and so \begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i &<  \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i +  \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&\leq U( P, f \alpha^\prime) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{6a} 
\end{align} for any point $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , for each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ . Now we show that $$ U(P, f, \alpha) = \sup \left\{ \ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i \colon \ s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right] \mbox{ for each } i = 1, \ldots, n \ \right\}. \tag{6b} $$ For each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ , let $$M_i(f) \colon= \sup \left\{ \ f(x) \ \colon \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i \ \right\}; \tag{6c} $$ now as $ f \left( s_i \right) \leq M_i (f)$ and as $\alpha$ is a monotonically increasing function on $[a, b]$ and hence also on $\left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , so $$ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha \left( x_i \right) - \alpha \left( x_{i-1} \right) \geq 0,$$ and therefore $ f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i \leq M_i(f) \Delta \alpha_i$ for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ , which implies that $$ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^n M_i(f) \Delta \alpha_i = U(P, f, \alpha). $$ Thus $U(P, f, \alpha)$ is an upper bound of the set in (6b). If $\alpha$ is constant on the interval $[a, b]$ , then, for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ , we have $\Delta \alpha_i = 0$ and so all the sums in the set in (6b) are zero,
and also $U(P, f, \alpha) = 0$ , and so  (6b) holds. So let's assume that $\alpha$ is not constant on the interval $[a, b]$ . Then there exists a sub-interval $\left[ x_{k-1}, x_k \right]$ (for some $k = 1, \ldots, n$ ) such that $$\Delta \alpha_k = \alpha\left( x_k \right) - \alpha\left( x_{k-1} \right) > 0. \tag{*}$$ As $\varepsilon > 0$ and as $\alpha$ is monotonically increasing on $[a, b]$ , so, for each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ , we have $$ M_i(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1  } < M_i(f),$$ and thus the real number $ M_i(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } $ is not an upper bound of the set in (6c), which implies that there exists a point $p_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ such that $$ M_i(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1  } < f\left(p_i\right),$$ and since $\Delta \alpha_i \geq 0$ , we have $$ \left[ M_i(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } \right] \Delta \alpha_i \leq  f\left(p_i\right) \Delta \alpha_i$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ ; but for $i= k$ we have $$ \left[ M_k(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } \right] \Delta \alpha_k <  f\left(p_k\right) \Delta \alpha_k;$$ therefore, $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ M_i(f) - \frac{\varepsilon}{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } \right] \Delta \alpha_i < \sum_{i=1}^n  f\left(p_i\right) \Delta \alpha_i,$$ that is, $$ \sum_{i=1}^n M_i(f) \Delta \alpha_i - \frac{\varepsilon }{\alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right]   < \sum_{i=1}^n  f\left(p_i\right) \Delta \alpha_i,  $$ which is the same as $$ U(P, f, \alpha) - \frac{\varepsilon }{\alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right] < \sum_{i=1}^n  f\left(p_i\right) \Delta \alpha_i.
\tag{6d} $$ But, as $a \leq b$ and as $\alpha$ is monotonically increasing, so $$ \alpha(a) \leq \alpha(b), $$ which implies that $$ 0 \leq \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) < \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1, $$ and so $$ 0 \leq \frac{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a)  }{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) + 1 } <  1, $$ which then  implies that $$ 0 \leq \frac{ \varepsilon  }{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) +1 } \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right] < \varepsilon, $$ and hence $$ - \varepsilon < - \frac{ \varepsilon  }{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) +1 } \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right]  \leq 0, $$ which implies that $$ U(P, f, \alpha) - \varepsilon < U(P, f, \alpha)  - \frac{ \varepsilon  }{ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) +1 } \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right] , \tag{6e} $$ Now from (6d) and (6e) we have $$ U(P, f, \alpha) -  \varepsilon < \sum_{i=1}^n  f\left(p_i\right) \Delta \alpha_i,  $$ which shows that no real number less than $U(P, f, \alpha)$ can be an upper bound of the set in (6b). Thus the real number $U(P, f, \alpha)$ is an upper bound of the set in (6b), but no real number less than $U(P, f, \alpha)$ is an upper bound of that set. Therefore (6b) holds. Now from (6a) we see that the real number $U(P, f \alpha^\prime) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ is an upper bound for the set in (6b), and from (6b) we know that $U(P, f, \alpha)$ is the least upper bound of this very set, so from (6a) and  (6b) we can conclude that $$ U(P, f, \alpha) \leq U(P, f \alpha^\prime) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. \tag{6} $$ Again from (5) we obtain $$ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i -  \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i <  \frac{\varepsilon}{2},$$ which implies that \begin{align} 
\sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i 
&< \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \Delta \alpha_i +  \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&\leq U(P, f, \alpha) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{7a} 
\end{align} for any point $s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right]$ , for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . We can show that $$ U(P, f\alpha^\prime) = \sup \left\{ \ \sum_{i=1}^n f \left( s_i \right) \alpha^\prime \left( s_i \right) \Delta x_i \ \colon \ s_i \in \left[ x_{i-1}, x_i \right] \mbox{ for each } i = 1, \ldots, n \ \right\}. \tag{7b} $$ From (7a) and (7b) we can conclude that $$ U(P, f\alpha^\prime) \leq  U(P, f, \alpha) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. \tag{7} $$ Now if $Q$ be any partition of $[a, b]$ such that $Q \supset P$ , then (by Theorem 6.4 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition) we have $$ L(P, \alpha^\prime) \leq L(Q, \alpha^\prime) \leq U(Q, \alpha^\prime) \leq U(P, \alpha^\prime), $$ which implies that $$ U(Q, \alpha^\prime) - L(Q, \alpha^\prime) \leq U(P, \alpha^\prime) - L(P, \alpha^\prime), $$ and this together with (1) implies that (1) also holds for $Q$ , and  therefore both (6) and (7) also hold for $Q$ . That is, if $Q$ is any refinement of $P$ , then $$ U(Q, f, \alpha) \leq U(Q, f \alpha^\prime) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{6*} $$ and $$ U( Q, f\alpha^\prime) \leq  U(Q, f, \alpha) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. \tag{7*} $$ Now let's suppose that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f \,d \alpha -   \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,d x > \varepsilon. \tag{8a} $$ As $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,dx + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} > 
\overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) \,dx, $$ so there exists a partition $P_1$ of $[a, b]$ such that $$ U\left( P_1, f \alpha^\prime \right) <  \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{8b} $$ which implies $$- U\left( P_1, f \alpha^\prime \right) > - \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \frac{\varepsilon}{2},$$ and so by (8a) we obtain \begin{align}
 \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha - U \left( P_1, f \alpha^\prime \right) &> \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha -
 \int_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&> \varepsilon - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&= \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, 
\end{align} which implies that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha - U \left( P_1, f \alpha^\prime \right) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. \tag{8c} $$ Now  if $Q$ is any partition of $[a, b]$ such that $Q \supset P_1$ , then (by Theorem 6.4 in Baby Rudin) $$ U(Q, f\alpha^\prime) \leq U \left( P_1, f\alpha^\prime \right),$$ and this together with  (8b) implies that $$ U(Q, f\alpha^\prime) <  \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{8b*} $$ from which we obtain $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha - U(Q, f \alpha^\prime ) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{8c*} $$ in just the same way as we have obtained (8c) from (8b). Now let $Q$ be any partition of $[a, b]$ such that $Q \supset P$ and $Q \supset P_1$ .
Then (8c*) holds for this $Q$ as well. But as $$ U(Q, f, \alpha) \geq \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha, $$ so (8c*) gives $$  U(Q, f, \alpha) - U \left( Q, f \alpha^\prime \right)  \geq \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha - U \left( Q, f \alpha^\prime \right)  
> \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, $$ which implies $$  U(Q, f, \alpha) - U \left( Q, f \alpha^\prime \right)  > \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, $$ and so $$  U(Q, f, \alpha) >  U \left( Q, f \alpha^\prime \right)  + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, $$ which contradicts (6*). Therefore (8a) cannot hold, and so $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha - \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx \leq \varepsilon. \tag{8} $$ Now let's suppose that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha > \varepsilon. \tag{9a}$$ As $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} > \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha, $$ so there exists a partition $P_2$ of $[a, b]$ such that $$ U \left( P_2, f, \alpha \right) <  \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{9b} $$ which implies that $$ - U \left( P_2, f, \alpha \right) > - \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, $$ which together with (9a) gives \begin{align}
\overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - U \left( P_2, f, \alpha \right) &> \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx -
\int_a^b f d\alpha - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&> \varepsilon - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&= \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, 
\end{align} which implies that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - U \left( P_2, f, \alpha \right) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. \tag{9c} $$ Now if $Q$ is any partition of $[a, b]$ such that $Q \supset P_2$ , then (by Theorem 6.4 in Baby Rudin) $$ U(Q, f, \alpha) \leq U \left( P_2, f, \alpha \right), $$ which together with (9b) yields $$  U(Q, f, \alpha) <  \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{9b*} $$ and then we obtain $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - U ( Q, f, \alpha ) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tag{9c*} $$ in just the same way as we have obtained (9c) from (9b). Now let $Q$ be any partition of $[a, b]$ such that $Q \supset P$ and $Q \supset P_2$ . Then (9c*) holds for this $Q$ . But as $$ U ( Q, f \alpha^\prime) \geq \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx, $$ so (9c*) gives $$ U(Q, f \alpha^\prime ) - U(Q, f, \alpha) \geq \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime (x) dx - U(Q, f, \alpha) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2},$$ which implies $$  U(Q, f \alpha^\prime ) - U(Q, f, \alpha) > \frac{\varepsilon}{2},$$ and so $$  U(Q, f \alpha^\prime ) >  U(Q, f, \alpha) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2},$$ which contradicts (7*). Thus (9a) cannot hold, and so we can conclude that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha \leq \varepsilon. \tag{9}$$ Now from (8) and (9) we can conclude that $$\left\lvert  \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha \right\rvert 
\leq \varepsilon $$ for any real number $\varepsilon > 0$ . Hence $$\left\lvert  \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx - \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha \right\rvert 
= 0, $$ which implies that $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha = \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx. \tag{A}  $$ An analogous argument gives $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha = \underline{\int}_a^b f(x)  \alpha^\prime (x) dx. \tag{B} $$ Now suppose $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ . Then $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f d\alpha = \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha, $$ and then (A) and (B) together imply $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx = \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx, $$ showing that $f\alpha^\prime \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a, b]$ . Conversely, suppose $f \alpha^\prime \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a, b]$ . Then $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx  = \overline{\int}_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx, $$ and then (A) and (B) together imply $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha = \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha , $$ showing that $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ . Finally, we assume that $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ --- which (as we have just shown) is equivalent to assuming that $f \alpha^\prime \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a, b]$ --- and then find from (A) and (B) that $$ \int_a^b f d\alpha = \int_a^b f(x) \alpha^\prime(x) dx, $$ as required.

2333266,"Can a simple, closed curve be homeomorphic to a closed curve that is not simple?","It seems like most standard definitions of simple curves in $\mathbb{R^2}$ are those without any self-intersections. Moreover, it can be shown that if $C$ is a simple closed curve, then $C$ is homeomorphic to the circle $S^1$. (All using the subspace topology of the standard Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R^n}$ for both, that is.) So suppose a curve $C$ is not simple, so that it has at least one point of self intersection. That is, if $C$ is identified as the image of a continuous function $f: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ from the circle to the plane, then there is at least one point $p\in S^1$ at which $f$ fails to be injective. In this case, can $C$ still be homeomorphic to a circle? My hunch is that it can not be, and here's what I've come up with so far: Towards a direct proof, I think that if $q = f(p)$ is such a point of self-intersection on the curve $C$, then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ may fail to be continuous at $q$. Intuitively, it seems like neighborhoods around this point will always contain points from at least two ""branches"" of $C$, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Using other topological invariants seemed promising - I think deleting the point $q$ breaks $C$ into at least two connected components while deleting its preimage $p$ leaves the circle in one connected component. Does this constitute a valid proof? Edit: Phrased another way, if we identify knots as continuous images of $S^1$ embedded in $\mathbb{R^3}$, when is a knot homeomorphic to $S^1$ ?","['knot-theory', 'general-topology']"

Here $X^{(k)}$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ jet bundle of sections of $X\to V$ and $j^k_x$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ jet of $x$. Now, say $G$ is some tensor bundle on $V$ and $X=TV$.

For example, Lang writes about Bochner integrals - which is slightly different from the 'usual' Lebesgue integral - which gives you a way to integrate Banach-space-valued maps. Also, he uses theorems of differential calculus (of Banach spaces) to prove results about flows on manifolds, which is quite fundamental to differential geometry. I'm on chapter 7 right now, and I wonder what other good books are there, dealing with this subject: calculus on Banach spaces. After dealing with integration and differentiation (in that order), Lang moves on to 'functional analysis', but I want to see more applications and examples of calculus; for example, Banach-space-valued power series (on $z\in\mathbb{C}$, say), whether one can use the familiar techniques of complex analysis in that case (e.g. Cauchy integral formula), or how the theory is used for differential topology/geometry.

2333640,"Doing calculus with ""currents""; how to learn this?","In mathematics, the word ""distribution"" means at least two different things: In analysis, they're elements of a certain dual space. In differential geometry, they're subsets of the tangent bundle satisfying certain axioms. I'm interested in the analysis version (i.e. concept 1), but doing it in the context of differential geometry. After Googling around a bit, I found the notion of a current , which is exactly what I was looking for; yay! This seems to give a very coherent viewpoint on the fundamental theorem of calculus; if I understand correctly, you can write stuff like $$\int_{x=a}^b 2x = \int_{x=a}^b \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} x^2\right) = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \int_{x=a}^b\right)(x^2) = [x^2]^b_{x=a} = b^2-a^2,$$ where $\int_{x=a}^b$ is thought of as a $0$-current on $\mathbb{R}$. Well, I'm not sure how much sense that really makes; perhaps the correct reasoning is more like: $$\int_{x=a}^b 2x dx = \int_{x=a}^b d(x^2) = \left(\partial \int_{x=a}^b\right)(x^2) = [x^2]^b_{x=a} = b^2-a^2,$$ where $\int_{x=a}^b$ is a $1$-current on $\mathbb{R}$. Honestly, I have no idea what I'm talking about; but, anyway it looks really interesting, and if I'm right that $\int_a^b$ can be viewed as both a $0$-current and $1$-current, that would go a long way toward clearing up some confusion I've had regarding the relationship between differential topology, where integrating forms over oriented submanifolds is all the rage, and measure theory, where integrating real-valued functions over subsets is hot Prada.

How do I compute $b_{ki} = \sum_j a_{kj,ij}$? Thanks! Edit: I thought the solution was that: In fact the object $\{a_{kl,ij}\}$ is a two-index object, as we should expect it to be. The subscript contains products of the numbers $k, l$ and $i, j$. The comma separates the two indices. But this cannot be true. Because using this, we compute the off-diagonal element $b_{12} = a_{12} + a_{24} = 19 \neq 28$. We instead want the off-diagonal element $b_{12} = a_{13} + a_{24} = 28,$ but I do not see how the prescription from wikipedia furnishes this.

2333944,Can one recover $G$ from $G/H$?,"I was thinking about a discussion that took place in the comments of some question on this site about quotient groups and isomorphic copies of these. One of the persons mentioned that in $G/H$ you have more information than in $K$($\simeq G/H$) because in $G/H$ you still have information about $G,H$. Indeed, you can recover $H$ as the unit of the group $G/H$ and taking the union, one has $G=\bigcup G/H$ . So set-theoretically, ""$(G,H) \to G/H$"" is injective (I put quotemarks there because $G/H$ is not only a function of the sets $G,H$ but also of multiplication on $G$). My question is the following : can you recover the group $G$ knowing the group $G/H$ ? (That is,also recover the multiplication, not only the underlying set) I guess a precise way to ask the question is : let $C$ be the category of couples $(G,H)$ where $G$ is a group (from here on, this means $G = (E, \cdot)$ where $\cdot$ satisfies the group axioms) and $H$ is a normal subgroup (here $H$ is only the underlying set though) and of group morphisms that preserve the normal subgroup ($f : (G,H) \to (K,N)$ has $f(H)\subset N$) and let $F$ be the functor $C\to \bf{Grp}$ that sends $(G,H)$ to $G/H$ and $f : (G,H) \to (K,N)$ to the canonically associated $\overline{f} : G/H \to K/N$. Is $F$ injective on objects ? (Though the functorial analysis here isn't necessary, it seemed like a good way of phrasing it) This says precisely this : given $G/H$ I know $G, H$, but do I know the multiplication ? EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, and in Hagen Von Eitzen's answer, the ""trivial case"" $G/G$ shows that the question as it now stands is trivial. But a more interesting (I hope) question comes out of it: for which normal subgroups can we recover $G$, or in a more global approach, for what subcategories $D$ of $C$ is the restriction of $F$ to $D$ injective on objects ? For instance, the (full) subcategory of couples $(G,\{e\})$ has this property (as knowing what $\{a\}\{b\} = a\{e\} b\{e\}$ is in $G/{e}$ tells you what $ab$ is).","['category-theory', 'group-theory']"

2334115,"Question about transportation-entropy inequality (From Villani's book: Optimal Transport, Old and New)","I was reading Villani's book: Optimal Transportation, Old and New. From page 80-83, he introduced some results about dual formulation of transport inequality. Assume $C(\mu,\nu)$ is the optimal transport distance from probability measure $\mu$ (defined on $\mathcal{X}$) to $\nu$ (defined on $\mathcal{Y}$), with cost function $c(\cdot,\cdot)$. Given a convex functional $F(\cdot)$ defined on $P(\mathcal{X})$, we can define its Legendre Transformation : $L(F)=\Lambda$, so $\Lambda$ is a convex functional on $C_b(\mathcal{X})$. The main result (Theorem 5.26) is:
\begin{equation*}
\forall \mu \in P(\mathcal{X}), C(\mu,\nu)\leq F(\mu)
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\forall \phi \in C_b(\mathcal{Y}), \Lambda(\int_\mathcal{Y}\phi d\nu-\phi^c)\leq 0\quad \phi^c:=\sup_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}(\phi(y)-c(x,y))
\end{equation*}
Are equivalent. Well this result is used to analyze transport inequalities. In Example 5.29, the author gives an important application of this result: Assume $\mathcal{Y}=\mathcal{X}$ and consider: 
\begin{equation*}
F(\mu):=KL(\mu||\nu)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\ln(\frac{d\mu}{d\nu})d\mu
\end{equation*}
which is the Kullback Liebller Divergence between measures (also known as relative entropy);
We could compute the Legendre Transformation of $F$, which has the following form:
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda(\phi):=\ln(\int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{\phi}d\nu)
\end{equation*}
Thus by the previous result, the transportation-entropy inequality 
\begin{equation*}
C(\mu,\nu)\leq KL(\mu||\nu) \quad \forall \mu\in P(\mathcal{X}) \quad (1)
\end{equation*}
is equivalent to :
\begin{equation}
\ln(\int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{\int \phi d\nu-\phi^c}d\nu)\leq 0
 \Leftrightarrow e^{\int_{\mathcal{X}}\phi d\nu}\leq (\int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{-\phi^c}d\nu)^{-1} \quad (2)
\end{equation}
But in the book, the author directly arrives at:
\begin{equation}
e^{\int_{\mathcal{X}}\phi d\nu}\leq \int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{\phi^c}d\nu \quad (3)
\end{equation}
If we apply Cauchy inequality, we will deduce from (1) to (3):
\begin{equation*}
e^{\int_{\mathcal{X}}\phi d\nu}\leq (\int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{-\phi^c}d\nu)^{-1}\leq \int_{\mathcal{X}}e^{\phi^c}d\nu 
\end{equation*}
But how could we deduce from (3) back to (1)? I am quite confused about it. I even think that $(3)$ and $(1)$ are equivalent is not a trivial corollary from our previous Theorem 5.26. Can any expert in this area help me with this problem? So many thanks!","['functional-analysis', 'functional-inequalities', 'optimal-transport', 'probability']"

$\mathcal{F} =\lbrace \emptyset,\lbrace H\rbrace,\lbrace T\rbrace, \lbrace H,T\rbrace \rbrace$. Then $\emptyset,\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ Closed under complementation (e.g. if $A = \lbrace H\rbrace$ then $A^c = \lbrace T\rbrace$ and both are in $\mathcal{F}$) Closed under countable unions (e.g. $A = \emptyset \cup \lbrace H\rbrace = \lbrace H\rbrace \in \mathcal{F}$) So I get how it works in these simple examples. But I don't get why all this fancy terminology is necessary. Why do I need this elaborate structure to be able to describe a coin flip?

$$ \begin{bmatrix} r_1 & \theta_1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & r^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} r_1 \\ \theta_1 \end{bmatrix} $$ Which gives me the answer: 
$\lvert\lvert\vec{a}\rvert\rvert^2 = r_1^2+r^2\theta_1^2$ Shouldn't it just give me the value $r_1^2$? Furthermore if I try and calculate the ""dot-product"" using this tensor for two arbitrary vectors $\vec{a}=r_1\hat{r}+\theta_1\hat{\theta}$ and $\vec{b}=r_2\hat{r}+\theta_2\hat{\theta}$, I get the result $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = r_1r_2+r^2\theta_1\theta_2$. Even if I set $r=0$, I get the result $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = r_1r_2$, which tells me that my vectors are parallel. That shouldn't be the necessarily the case since they are arbitrary vectors. Please, pardon my lack of mathematical formalism, just a lowly physics major trying to self study tensors.","['coordinate-systems', 'tensors', 'differential-geometry', 'vector-analysis']"

2334628,Determination of a Joukowski airfoil chord (demonstration),"I'm currently studying Aerodynamics, and one thing that I noticed is that the maximum and minimum $x$ coordinate of the airfoils (which are necessary to compute the chord) on the transformed plane (let it be $z(x,y)$ ) correspond to the transformed intersection points of the circumference on the original plane  (let it be $\zeta(\xi,\eta)$ ) with the real axis. I don't find any proof of this statement, and so I tried to do it by myself. The problem is that it got too complicated to be solved analytically (too many different powers of trignometric functions). So I'm requesting someone to try demonstrate this too. I think that there's a simpler way to do it. There's my introduction to the problem: Consider the original circumference defined on the complex $\zeta$ plane: where $a$ is the circumference radius, and $b$ the intersection of the circumference with the real positive axis, $\xi$ . The parameter $\beta$ is the angle between the horizontal line and the line that links $\zeta_0$ to $b$ . The center of the circumference is: $$\zeta_0=-b\varepsilon+ia\sin(\beta)=-b\varepsilon+i(1+\varepsilon)b\tan(\beta)$$ So, this circumference is defined by: $$\zeta=-b\varepsilon+b\frac{1+\varepsilon}{\cos(\beta)}\left(e^{i\theta}+i\sin(\beta)\right),\hspace{15pt}\theta \in [0,2\pi]$$ Now I need to show that for the Joukowski transform $z=\zeta+\frac{b^2}{\zeta}$ the $x$ coordinate (real coordinate on the plane $z$ ) has
a maximum on $\zeta=b$ (intersection of the circunference with the positive real axis) and a minimum on $\zeta=-b(1+2\varepsilon)$ , (intersection of the circunference with the negative real axis).","['complex-analysis', 'physics', 'optimization', 'transformation']"
2334730,"Prob. 6, Sec. 3.3, in Kreyszig's Functional Analysis Book: What is $Y^\perp$ if $Y = \ldots \subset \ell^2$?","Let $Y$ be the subset of $\ell^2$ given by $$ Y \colon= \left\{ \ \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \xi_{2n} = 0 \ \mbox{ for all } \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}. $$ Then $Y$ is a closed subspace of the Hilbert space $\ell^2$ , and so $Y$ is also complete. What is $Y^\perp$ ? Here is the relevant definition: Let $X$ be an inner product space, and let $M$ be a non-empty subset of $X$ . Then the orthogonal complement $M^\perp$ of $M$ is defined as follows: $$ M \colon= \left\{ \ x \in X \ \colon \  \langle x, y \rangle = 0 \ \mbox{ for all } \ y \in M \ \right\}. $$ My effort: By definition, \begin{align}
& Y^\perp \\
&= \left\{ \ x \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \langle x, y \rangle = 0 \ \forall y \in Y \ \right\} \\
&= \left\{ \ \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \left\langle \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }, \left( \eta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \right\rangle = 0 \ \forall \left( \eta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in Y \ \right\} \\

&= \left\{ \ \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty  \xi_n  \overline{  \eta_n} = 0 \ \forall \left( \eta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in \ell^2 \ \mbox{ such that } \ \eta_{2n} = 0 \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}  \ \right\} \\

\end{align} My intuition is that $$Y^\perp = \left\{ \ \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \xi_{2n-1} = 0 \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}  \ \right\}.$$ Is it so? If yes, then how to prove this rigorously? Another approach: As $\ell^2$ is a Hilbert space and as $Y$ is a closed subspace of $\ell^2$ , so $$ \ell^2 = Y \oplus Y^\perp, $$ by Theorem 3.3-4 in the book Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications by Erwine Kreyszig. This means that every $x \in \ell^2$ has a unique representation $$ x = y+z, \ \mbox{ where } \ y \in Y \ \mbox{ and } \ z \in Y^\perp. $$ Now  if $x \colon= \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell^2$ , then, by definition, the series $\sum \left\lvert \xi_n \right\rvert^2$ of non-negative real numbers converges in $\mathbb{R}$ . Therefore, the sequence $$ \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2 \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $$ of the partial sums of the series $\sum \left\lvert \xi_n \right\rvert^2$ , which is also monotonically increasing, is convergent. Hence this sequence is bounded (from above). That is, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , we have $$ \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2 \leq \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2, $$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2 = \sup \left\{ \ \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_j \right\rvert^2 \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} < +\infty. $$ Now let $y \colon= \left( \eta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ be ths sequence of (real or complex) numbers defined as follows: For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , let $$ \eta_{2n-1} \colon= \xi_{2n-1} \ \mbox{ and } \eta_{2n} \colon= 0. $$ Then the sequence $$ \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2 \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } $$ of the partial sums of the series $\sum \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2$ is given by $$ \sum_{j=1}^{2n-1} \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2 = \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_{2j-1} \right\rvert^2, $$ and $$ \sum_{j=1}^{2n} \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2 = \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \xi_{2j-1} \right\rvert^2 $$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . And, this sequence, being a sequence of sums of non-negative real numbers, is also monotonically increasing and  bounded above by the sum of the convergent series $ \sum \left\lvert \xi_n \right\rvert^2$ . So the sequence $$ \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2 \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } $$ is convergent, which means that the series $ \sum  \left\lvert \eta_j \right\rvert^2$ converges. Therefore, $y \colon= \left( \eta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ is in $\ell^2$ . 
  So from the definition of $Y$ we can conclude that $y \in Y$ . Now let $z \colon= \left( \zeta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the sequence of (real or complex) numbers defined as follows: For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , let $$ \zeta_{2n-1} \colon= 0 \ \mbox{ and } \ \zeta_{2n} \colon= \xi_{2n}. $$ Then $x = y+z$ , and so $z = x-y \in \ell^2$ , because $\ell^2$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Another way to show that $z \colon= \left( \zeta_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is in $\ell^2$ is to show that the series $\sum \left\lvert \zeta_n \right\rvert^2$ of real numbers converges in $\mathbb{R}$ . Now the sequence $$ \left( \sum_{j=1}^n  \left\lvert \zeta_j \right\rvert^2 \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$$ of the partial sums of the series $\sum \left\lvert \zeta_n \right\rvert^2$ is  given by $$ \sum_{j=1}^{2n-1}  \left\lvert \zeta_j \right\rvert^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{2n-2}  \left\lvert \xi_{2j} \right\rvert^2,   $$ and $$ \sum_{j=1}^{2n}  \left\lvert \zeta_j \right\rvert^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{2n}  \left\lvert \xi_{2j} \right\rvert^2   $$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Thus this sequence, being a sequence of sums of non-negative real numbers, is monotonically increasing and bounded above by the sum of the series $\sum \left\lvert \xi_n \right\rvert^2$ , and  so this sequence is convergent, which implies that $z \in \ell^2$ . Thus $$ y = \left( \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3, \ldots \right) = \left( \xi_1, 0, \xi_3, 0, \xi_5, 0, \ldots \right), $$ and $$ z = \left( \zeta_1, \zeta_2, \zeta_3, \ldots \right) = \left( 0, \xi_2, 0, \xi_4, 0, \xi_6,  \ldots \right),  $$ and so $$ \langle y, z \rangle = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \eta_n \overline{\zeta_n} = 0, $$ and so $\langle y, z \rangle = 0$ also. In fact, we can also show that $\langle z, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v \in Y$ . Thus $z \in Y^\perp$ . But so far I have only been able to show that the subspace $$ Z = \left\{  \ \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }  \in \ell^2 \ \colon \ \xi_{2n-1} = 0 \ \forall \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$$ is contained in $Y^\perp$ . Is what I have done so far correct, logically sound, and rigorous enough? If so, then how to complete the above two arguments? If not, then where do I lack? P.S.: In order to show that $Y$ is indeed closed in $\ell^2$ , let us suppose that $x \colon= \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ is an element in the closure of $Y$ in $\ell^2$ . Then, by Theorem 1.4-6 (a) in Kreyszig, there exists a sequence $\left(y_m \right)_{m \in \mathbb{N} }$ , where $y_m \colon= \left( \eta_{mn} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , converging to $x$ in $\ell^2$ . For each $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , as $y_m = \left( \eta_{mn} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} } \in Y$ , so we must have $\eta_{m, 2n} = 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , that is, we must have $$ \eta_{m2} = \eta_{m4} = \eta_{m6} = \cdots = 0. $$ Now let us choose an arbitrary natural number $N$ . We show that the sequence $\left( \eta_{mN} \right)_{m \in \mathbb{N} }$ converges (in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ as the case may be) to the number $\xi_N$ . As the sequence $\left(y_m \right)_{m \in \mathbb{N} }$ converges in $\ell^2$ to the point $x$ , so given any real number $\varepsilon > 0$ , there exists a natural number $M$ such that $$ d_{\ell^2} \left( y_m, x \right) < \varepsilon $$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m > M$ . 
  But we have $x = \left( \xi_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ , and, for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , we have $y_m = \left( \eta_{m n} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ . So we can conclude that $$ \sqrt{ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left\lvert \eta_{m n} - \xi_n \right\rvert^2 } < \varepsilon $$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m > M$ . And, so we obtain $$ \left\lvert \eta_{mN} - \xi_N \right\rvert = \sqrt{ \left\lvert \eta_{mN} - \xi_N \right\rvert  } \leq \sqrt{ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left\lvert \eta_{mn} - \xi_n \right\rvert^2 } < \varepsilon $$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m > M$ . Thus it follows that the sequence $\left( \eta_{m N} \right)_{m \in \mathbb{N} }$ converges to $\xi_N$ . Now since for each $N \in \mathbb{N}$ , we have $$ \xi_N = \lim_{m \to \infty} \eta_{m N}, $$ and since for each $N \in \mathbb{N}$ , we have $\eta_{m, 2N} = 0$ , 
  therefore we must have $$ \xi_{2N} = 0$$ for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$ , which shows that $x = \left( \xi_{n} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ is in $Y$ . But this $x$ was an arbitrary element of the closure of $Y$ in $\ell^2$ . Thus it follows that $\mbox{Cl}(Y) \subset Y \subset \mbox{Cl}(Y)$ . Hence $Y$ is closed.","['real-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'inner-products', 'analysis']"

So, please, be explicit as much as possible (and excuse me for this probable dumb question). Given a divisor $D$ on a complexe projective curve $X$, there is a nice way to build a line bundle, $[D]$, which first Chern class is almost $D$ : it's just the Poincaré dual of $D$ when understood as homology class. For example, if I take the canonical bundle $K_X$ of $X$, then $$K_X = c_1(T^*X) = -c_1(X).$$ And now there is two ways to compute $l(K_X)$, the dimension of the linear system of $K_X$. On one hand, we can do some explicit computation (it's classical algebraic geometry).
On the other hand, if I admit that $l(K_X)$ is the genus of $X$, $g(X)$, then since :
$$\langle c_1(X),[X]\rangle = \chi(X) = 2-2g(X)$$
we get
$$ l(K_X) = \frac {\langle K_X,[X]\rangle}2 - 1.$$ My questions are the following : Is there such a way to compute $l(D)$ for a general divisor $D$, i.e. in terms of the topology of the line bundle associated ?

I think we must use the Radon-Nikodym theorem here. Firstly any finite measure $v$ on $(X,P(X))$ is $\sigma$-finite. Also $v$ is absolutely continous with respect to $u$ since if $u(E) = 0$ then $|E| = 0$ so $E = \emptyset$ and so $v(E) = v(\emptyset) = 0$ (because it is a measure). However, $u$ (the counting measure) is not necessarily $\sigma$-finite, i.e. if $X$ is uncountable. So I cannot use the Radon-Nikodym here. Perhaps the question was meant to restrict $X$ to countable sets? Since then $u$ is $\sigma$-finite and then Radon-Nikodym applies to give the result.

Question: For a step $c$, if $n \in [1, 2^c]$, what is the probability the graph has $n$ nodes? Is there a closed form expression? My thoughts are that you'd have to ""add down the tree"" to get the probability for a specific branch. However, there are multiple ways of having $n$ nodes, which I assume you'd account for by multiplying the probabilities of having each possibility together, i.e. $P(x_j + \dots + x_k) \cdots P(x_m + \dots + x_n)$, where $x_m \dots x_n$ are probabilities in a combination of nodes that gives $n$ nodes overall.

The width is slightly skew due to each step $c$ having a different max number of nodes, however we can still see the shape of the plot well. where the solid lines are approximations using the Gaussian curve, $$ \frac{A}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{\frac{-(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} ,$$ $c=11 \to (A=1.00334,\, x_0=15.5507, \, \sigma=6.37225)$, $c=10 \to (A=1.00428,\, x_0=13.0468, \, \sigma=5.50204)$, $c=9 \to (A=1.0053,\, x_0=10.8424, \, \sigma=4.68556)$, $c=7 \to (A=1.01089,\, x_0=7.25233, \, \sigma=3.33195)$, $c=5 \to (A=1.02033,\, x_0=4.58044, \, \sigma=2.22072)$. It's interesting that it's close to a Gaussian distribution, however I'm not sure if this helps in finding a closed form. Maybe one could define $f : \mathbb N \to \mathbb R^3$, which maps $c$ to $A$, $x_0$, and $\sigma$. How one would go about this? My only idea is to calculate $A$, $x_0$, and $\sigma$ a considerable number more times and try to fit the data with Mathematica. I've shown the general trend of the data here .","['graph-theory', 'probability', 'trees']"
2335024,What is the difference between equality and congruence outside of geometry? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Congruent Modulo $n$: definition [duplicate] (4 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Yes, I have seen that this question has been asked and answered before in this same website, but answers given there were mostly in regards to geometry, or non-mathematical examples (e.g. ""the 'e's in the word 'between' are congruent, but not equal"", ""two triangles with the same dimensions and points are equal""). I can understand this just fine, but I can't use this advice when it comes to pure numbers, like mods. For example: $17 \equiv 5 (mod(6))$. How is this statement correct? If we solve $5 (mod(6))$ we get $5$, so that would mean $17 \equiv 5$. Also, $17 \equiv 4(mod(13))$, which means $17 \equiv 4$, and $17 \equiv 3(mod(7))$, which is $17 \equiv 3$ So then, $17 \equiv 5 \equiv 4  \equiv 3$ is true? That doesn't seem right.
Are all positive integers congruent to one another? I know this may seem like a simple matter to some, but I'm seriously stuck.","['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
