1957955,Reference request: Asymptotic distribution of degenerate V-statistics,"I'm looking for references on the asymptotic distribution of V-statistics with 2nd order degenerate symmetric kernel $h:\mathcal{X}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ of degree $k\geq 2$. That is, we are considering the following V-statistic
$$
V_n = \frac{1}{n^k}\sum_{i_1=1}^n\cdots \sum_{i_k=1}^n h(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k})
$$ and the corresponding U-statistic
$$
U_n = {n\choose k}^{-1}\sum_{1\leq i_1<\cdots <i_k \leq n} h(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k})
$$
for some i.i.d. sequence $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of random elements in $\mathcal{X}$. If $h$ is 2nd order degenerate we know that 
$
nU_n \Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda_i (Z_i^2-1),
$
where $(Z_i)$ is an i.i.d. sequence of standard normal distributed random variables and $(\lambda_i)$ is the eigenvalues of a linear operator $S:L^2(\mathcal{X},P_X)\to L^2(\mathcal{X},P_X)$. The procedure used by Serfling(1980) to derive the asymptotic distribution of V-statistics from the asymptotic distribution of U-statistics in the non-degenerate case, can't be used when $h$ is degenerate. However I have seen some weak convergence results for V-statistics with degenerate kernels: Every monograph on U-statistics I have encountered ( ""Theory of U-statistics"" (1994) by Borovskich and Koroljuk p. 141 & ""Approximation Theorems of Mathematical Statistics"" (1980) by Serfling p. 227 ) only shows the degenerate V-statistic weak convergence for $k=2$, that is if $h$ is a 2nd order degenerate kernel of degree 2, then (under some conditions of course)
$$

1958079,Equations for this parameterised affine transform on the plane?,"I'm trying to find a parameterised affine transform that will transform the unit circle into the family of ellipses shown. The unit circle passes through (0,1) and (1,0) and is tangential to the lines (1,x) and (x,1). In this question, the circle is transformed into an ellipse that retains those properties.  Because the properties only fix 4 parameters and a unique ellipse requires 5, there will be a family of ellipses, defined by a single parameter ""p"" (""p"" being arbitrary within some range), which all share these same 4 properties with the unit circle. Since a transform from a unit circle to an ellipse (however rotated or translated) is affine, I'd expect to be able to represent the transform from the unit circle to a member of this family of ellipses in this kind of form: x -> A.x + B.y + C
y -> D.x + E.y + F where A,B,C,D,E,F are functions of ""p"". (It isn't important what ""p"" actually represents, so long as it parameterises the family of ellipses.) I'm having difficulty getting a suitable transform for this. The approach I tried was to look at what happens to 3 easy points under the required transform: (0,1) and (1,0) stay fixed at (0,1) and (1,0), and (0,0) must be mapped due to symmetry, to some other point on the diagonal (Z, Z) where Z < 1/sqrt(2) and Z will often be negative. This gives 6 trivial equations in 6 variables, and as there should be just one solution for any given value of the parameter this should be it. But when I do this, I get an ellipse that isn't tangential to the 2 lines, I think that's because the lines that the ellipse I get is tangent to at the fixed points, have also been transformed and are no longer horizontal/vertical. Has my approach inadvertently loosened up the parameters so that I'm getting multiple families? If not, then what's going on, and what do I have to do to fix it?","['conic-sections', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations', 'geometry']"
1958089,Action of $Sp(1)$ over the sphere $S^7$,"Consider the Hausdorff space $S^4 = \mathbb{HP}^1$ and the topological group $Sp(1)$ (identified with the unit quaternions), the cover $\{V_j\}_{j \in J} = \{U_1, U_2\}$ of $\mathbb{HP}^1$ where $$U_1= \{[q^1, q^2] \in \mathbb {HP}^1; q^1 \neq 0 \}\ \ \text{and} \ \ U_2= \{[q^1, q^2] \in \mathbb {HP}^1; q^2 \neq 0 \}$$ and the transition functions $g_{ji} : U_i \cap U_j \to Sp(1)$ for $i,j= 1,2$ are determined by $$g_{12} ([q^1,q^2]) = (q^2/|q^2|) (q^1/|q^1|)^{-1}$$ By the Reconstruction Theorem there exists an $Sp(1)$-bundle over $S^4 = \mathbb {HP}^1$ with transition functions $\{g_{11}, g_{12}, g_{21}, g_{22}\}$. On the other hand consider the usual Hopf bundle $(S^7,\mathbb{HP}^1, \mathcal P, S^3 )$ where $\mathcal P: S^7 \to \mathbb{HP}^1$ is given by $\mathcal P (q) = [q] = [q^1,q^2]$ (restriction of the quotient map that determines the equivalence relation $\sim$ in $\mathbb{H}^2 -\{0\}$ to the sphere $S^7$) where the transition functions $g'_{ji} : U_i \cap U_j \to Sp(1)$ for $i,j= 1,2$ are determined by $$g'_{12} ([q^1,q^2]) = (q^1/|q^1|) (q^2/|q^2|)^{-1}$$ Question: Show that the underlying locally trivial bundle for the $Sp(1)$-bundle over $S^4 = \mathbb {HP}^1$ is the same of the Hopf bundle, but the action of $Sp(1)$ on $S^7$ is different. Describe the action. Thoughts: $1)$ From the Reconstruction Theorem we have that the total space $P$ is the set of all equivalence classes $$[x,g,j] = \{(x,g_{kj}(x)g, k) ; k \in \{1,2\} \ \ \text{and} \ \ x \in U_j \cap U_k\}$$ 
I couldn't show that $P$ is the sphere $S^7$. The local trivializations for the $Sp(1)$-bundle are $$\begin{align}\Phi_j : U_j \times Sp(1) &\to \mathcal P^{-1}
(U_j)\\ (x,g) &\mapsto [x,g,j]\end{align}$$ while for the Hopf Bundle we have $$\begin{align}\Psi_1 : U_1 \times Sp(1) &\to \mathcal P^{-1}(U_1)\\ ([q], y) =([q^1,q^2],y) &\mapsto (|q^1|y, q^2(q^1)^{-1}|q^1|y)\end{align}$$ similar to $\Psi_2$. I can't see how $\Phi_1 = \Psi_1$. 2) The action $\sigma : P \times Sp(1) \to P$ is given by $\sigma (p,h) = p \cdot h = [x,g,j] \cdot h = [x, gh, j]$. Which I couldn't describe on $S^7$. So far, I understand that $\sigma$ acts on values of the group $Sp(1)$ alone where the action $\sigma'$ given by $\sigma((q^1,q^2), h) = (q^1,q^2)\cdot h=(q^1 h, q^2 h)$, for any $q^1, q^2 \in \mathcal P^{-1} (x)$, where $x \in S^4=\mathbb {HP}^1$ acts on elements not necessarily from the group $Sp(1) = S^3$.

$$x^2=12z^2+1$$

For example, if $f(t)=e^{yt}$, since the coefficients $a_n=y^n$, we get $$e^{yt}x^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}y^k x^{n-k}=(x+y)^n$$ by linearity, $$(e^{yt}-1)x^n=(x+y)^n-x^n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\binom{n}{k}y^k x^{n-k}$$ and perhaps not as obvious $$\left(\frac{e^{yt}-1}{t}\right)x^n=\int_{x}^{x+y}u^ndu$$ Now suppose that $f(t)=e^{yt}-1-yt$.  Then $$(e^{yt}-1-yt)x^n=(x+y)^n-x^n-ynx^{n-1}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}\binom{n}{k}y^k x^{n-k}$$ Obviously there is a nice formed forward difference equation in the previous case that is not happening here.  But there is a relationship with subtracted terms of the binomial expansion.  What i would really like help understanding is whether or not a possible analogous integral representation exists for the following operator: $$\left(\frac{e^{yt}-1-yt}{t^2}\right)x^n=\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{y^{k+2}}{(k+2)(k+1)}\frac{t^k}{k!}\right)x^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\frac{y^{k+2}}{(k+1)(k+2)}x^{n-k}$$ $$=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n+2}{k+2}\frac{y^{k+2}}{(n+1)(n+2)}x^{n-k}=\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=2}^{n+2}\binom{n+2}{k}y^kx^{n+2-k}$$ It is not as simple.  Clearly $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\frac{x^{n+2}}{((n+2)(n+1)}$.  If I integrated below I think the math is correct $$\int_x^{x+y}{\frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1}}du=\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=1}^{n+2}\binom{n+2}{k}y^kx^{n+2-k}$$ Which is really close, but the lower bound on the summation is $1$, not $2$.

1958527,Proof: Every convergent sequence of real numbers is bounded,"(Taken from an old exam - no homework:) Prove that every convergent sequence of real numbers is bounded. It would be cruel if our professor would take a task like that in the exam because I rather prefer calculating than doing theory (in an exam where you haven't got much time to describe things..). But I'll be honest and say I dislike theory in general! :-) Anyway, for the task, I really got no idea how to proof that but I'll give it a try... We know that if a sequence is convergent it has exactly ONE limit where the sequences (sry my English here) accumulate. So the sequence will have an upper bound or lower bound, based on the limit, thus it will be surely bounded if it's convergent sequence. Even if my proof is wrong (most likely..) I'd like to see a proof like mine, where you avoid using (complicated) maths symbols. Just using words any human can understand would be awesome! :-) Of course a more formal proof is welcome too but not necessarily preferred ^.^","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'proof-explanation', 'convergence-divergence', 'analysis']"

Here is my attempt: Proof: We wish to show that as $x$ gets arbitrarily large that the difference between $f(x)$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ gets arbitrarily small. In other words, we show that $\forall \epsilon > 0$ $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $$x > \delta \Rightarrow \bigg| \frac{x^2 + x - 1}{3x^2 + 2x + 1} - \frac{1}{3} \bigg| < \epsilon$$ Now observe for $x > 2$, \begin{align*}

&< \frac{1}{x+1}
\end{align*} Let $\delta = \max\left\{ 2, \dfrac{1}{\epsilon} - 1 \right\}$. Then, if $x > \delta$ we have that
$$\star < \dfrac{1}{x+1} < \frac{1}{\delta + 1} = \dfrac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} - 1 \right) + 1} = \epsilon$$ I just want to make sure that I did this correctly. Thank you.","['infinity', 'calculus', 'limits']"

Or we may just let it sit as an unknown parameter. My questions are if this captures all possible extensions of the factorial with the given conditions, since, if it did, it'd be a pretty good general extension to the factorial? Given a few more assumptions, it is easy enough to set bounds to what $f'(0)$ might be as well. Notably, this representation fails when considering $\Re(x)\le-1$ , but coupled with the first condition, it is extendable to all $x$ , except of course the negative integers. robjohn♦ notes an extension to the harmonic numbers that converges for $x\in\mathbb C$ , except the negative integers: $$\int_0^1\frac{1-t^\phi}{1-t}dt=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac1n-\frac1{n+\phi}\right)$$ Any suggestions on things I could've improved and flaws in this would be nice.

Otherwise, there exists an element $a_{1}$ such that $a_{1} \leq a_{0}$ and $a_{1} \neq a_{0}$. If $a_{1}$ is minimal, then we are done. Otherwise, we can choose an element $a_{2}$ such that $a_{2} \leq a_{1}$ and $a_{2} \neq a_{1}$. Proceeding in this way, we produce a sequence 
  $$
a_{0} \geq a_{1} \geq a_{2} \geq \cdots
$$ Since ${A}$ is finite, this sequence must have some repeated terms: that is, we must have $a_{i} = a_{j}$ for some $j \neq i$ . WLOG we may assume that $j > i$. Then $a_{i} = a_{j} \leq a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+1} \leq a_{i}$.

where $\frac{d\mathbb{P}}{d \lambda}$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mathbb{P}$ with respect to $\lambda$.  We then set $f=\frac{d\mathbb{P}}{d \lambda}$ and call $f$ the probability density function. Alright, so I know there's an error here since I really want

F(a) = \int_{-\infty}^a f d\lambda

1959001,"Functions in modular arithmetic that are injective, surjective, or invertible.","There is a question I am struggling on. Let f : Z12 → Z12 : x ↦→ 9 x + 1 where arithmetic is done modulo 12. (a) Show that f is neither injective, nor surjective. (b) Now consider g, where g : Z12 → Z12 : x ↦ 7 x + 1. Show that g is invertible.
Calculate g^−1(0) and g^−1(11). 
Find a formula for g^−1(x). Hint: first find a number x so that 7 x is equivalent to 1 modulo 12. Now use this judiciously. Can someone tell me if my working out is correct and how to improve the answer. Here is what I worked out :
a) f is not injective, because f(0) = 1 = f(4), but 1 and 4 are distinct mod 12. Next, f is not surjective, because there is no x in Z12 such that 
f(x) = 9x + 1 = 2 (mod 12), since this is equivalent to 9x = 1 (mod 12) 
and 9 is not invertible mod 12, because gcd(9, 12) = 3 > 1. (b) Given y in Z12, we want to find y in Z12 such that y = g^(-1)(x). 
<==> g(y) = x. 
<==> 7y + 1 = x (mod 12) 
<==> 7y = x - 1 (mod 12) 
<==> 7 * 7y = 7(x - 1) (mod 12) 
<==> y = 7x - 7 (mod 12), since 49 = 1 (mod 12) 
<==> y = 7x + 5 (mod 12), since -7 = 5 (mod 12). That is, g^(-1)(x) = 7x + 5. In particular, g^(-1)(0) = 5, and g^(-1)(11) = 82 = 10 (mod 12).","['modular-arithmetic', 'functions', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1959191,Sheaf of differentials on an elliptic curve,"I'm trying to understand something relating to differentials on an elliptic curve. Let's say my elliptic curve $C = \text{Proj}(k[X,Y,Z]/Y^2Z-X^3-aXZ^2-bZ^3)$ over some characteristic $0$ field $k$. I know that (and have the idea of why) $H^1_{dR}(C) = H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k}) \oplus H^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C)$. So, since $H^1_{dR}$ in particular is isomorphic to $H^{1}_{dR}(U)$ where $U = D(Z) = \text{Spec}(k[x,y]/y^2-x^3-ax-b)$, then we can deduce that $H^1_{dR}$ has a $k$-basis of $\omega, x\omega$, where $y\omega=dx$ on $U$. Since $H^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k})$ is $0$-th sheaf cohomology of $\Omega^1$, this is $\Omega^1_C(C)$, the space of global differentials on $C$. I know that this should be 1 dimensional, since the dimensions should be the genus of the curve. Since $\omega$ is regular at $\infty=[0:1:0]$ but $x\omega$ is not (having a pole of order $2$), is this enough to imply that the basis of $\Omega^1_C(C)$ is given by the differential $\omega$? What I'm struggling to explicitly write out are all the details involved. If I consider the sheaf $\Omega^1_U$ and take global sections, we get differentials which can be written uniquely as $$ \alpha=(P(x)+Q(x)y)\omega $$ for some $P(x),Q(x) \in k[x]$. I think that I should the be doing is looking at $V = D(Y) = $ $ \text{Spec} ( k[w,z] /z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3) $, where $w=x/y$ and $z=1/y$. So then on $D(YZ)$ we have that $\omega = dx/y = dw - \frac{w}{z}dz$ and $$\begin{split} \alpha = &  (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))(dw-\frac{w}{z}dz) \\ = & (P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dw - (\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z}))dz \end{split}$$ If we let $R=k[w,z] /(z- w^3 - awz^2 - bz^3)$, then $$\Omega^1|_V = (Rdw\oplus Rdv)/(dz -3w^2dw - az^2dw - 2awzdz - 3bz^2dz) $$ If $Q \neq 0$ and $\deg P>0$, then the expressions $P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{1}{z}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ and $\frac{w}{z}P(\frac{w}{z})+\frac{w}{z^2}Q(\frac{w}{z})$ are not polynomial in $w,z$ and $\alpha$ will not lie in $\Omega^1|_V$. So then we have $Q=0$ and $P(x) \in k$ and so we get that $\Omega^1_C(C)= \lbrace a \omega : a \in k \rbrace $. My question is, does this look vaguely correct or have I just gone a bit up the left with it? Would a similar argument show, say, that the differentials $dx/y, xdx/y,...,x^{g-1}dx/y$ on a hyperelliptic curve are a basis of the global differentials there? I know that on an affine chart such as $y^2=f(x)$ we get twice as many, but the other half all have poles at infinty.

So let $x \in[x]$ and $y\in [y]$ and let $d(x,y):=\inf(|x-y|)$ be a metric that gives the smallest distance between two points. Now let $d(x,y)=\epsilon$, then we can find open sets $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(x_i)$ and $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(y_i)$ such that $$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(x_i)\cap \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(y_i)=\emptyset$$ Then for any vector $z\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ also $$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(x_i+z_i)\cap \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n B_{\epsilon/2}(y_i+z_i)=\emptyset$$ Here I don't know any further $(3$ locally homeomorphic $)$ : Now chose an open set $U$ such that for $x\in [x]$ we have that $x\in U$. We have to show that $\exists \varphi:\mathbb{R}^n / \mathbb{Z}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\varphi(U)$ is an open subset in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Now since $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \simeq S^1$ we have that $$\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n = (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times \dots \times \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \simeq (S^1\times \dots \times S^1) = S^n$$
so there exist a homoemorphism $g:\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n \to S^n$. So let $f^{-1}(y):=e^{iy}$ for $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ then $f(x)=\frac{1}{i}\ln(x)$ is a continuous map that maps from $S^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$, hence there is a continuous map $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^n / \mathbb{Z}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and it's $\varphi(x):=f(g(x))$ such that $\forall U$ we have that $\varphi(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set. $(1)$ This one I don't know.

1959794,Why does $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \lvert k^2 \sin (k^4) \rvert = 0$?,"For context: the question was if $x^2 y^2 \sin(\frac{1}{x^4}) + 2$ converges on $2$ for $x \rightarrow 0$. My initial assumption was that this is false because if I use the sequence $(x_k, y_k) = (\frac{1}{k}, k^2)$ this works out as $\mathop{\lim}\limits_{k \rightarrow \infty} \lvert k^2 \sin(k^4) \rvert \overset{?}{=} 0$, which intuitively seems to diverge. Yet the correct answer to the question was that it does indeed converge, and Wolfram Alpha also says so. But plotting the sequence with GeoGebra for the first 1000 elements shows a somewhat ""random"", yet growing sequence 1 . So why does $\lvert k^2 \sin(k^4) \rvert$ sequence converge? 1 Using the command Sequence[(k, abs(k² sin(k⁴))), k, 1, 1000]","['calculus', 'limits']"

I assume that all the dimensions are known.

1959966,"Describing ring properties in terms of infinitary sentences (Hodges, Model Theory, 2.2-9)","I'm self-studying Model Theory via Hodges' book Model Theory and got stuck in the following problem (see below for notation): Section 2.2, Problem 9 : For each of the following classes, show that it can be defined by a single sentence of $L_{\omega_1\omega}$. (a) Unique factorization domains. (b) Principal ideal domains. (c) Dedekind domains. (d) Semisimple rings. (e) Left coherent rings. (f) Left artinian rings. (g) Noetherian local commutative rings. (h) Groups $G$ such that if $H,K$ are any two isomorphic finitely generated subgroups of $G$ then $H$ is congruent to $K$ in $G$. The problem reduces to restate the properties in each item in a suitable manner, without dealing directly with ideals and subgroups but rather only with elements of the ring in question (finitely many of them at a time). See below for more details. My problem is: Problem: I don't know how to solve items (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), because I don't know how to write conditions on ideals (and chains of these) in the given language. Some notation: The signature $L$ for rings is $\langle 0,1,+,-,\cdot\rangle$. Given an ordinal $\kappa$, we define the language $L_{\kappa\omega}$ in the usual manner, but we allow disjunctions and conjunction on sets of cardinality $<\kappa$, i.e., if $I$ is a set of formulas of $L_{\kappa\omega}$ with $|I|<\kappa$, then $\bigvee_{\phi\in I}\phi$ and $\bigwedge_{\phi\in I}\phi$ are formulas of $L_{\kappa\omega}$ (but we can only put quantifiers over finitely many variables: that's what the $\omega$ in $L_{\kappa\omega}$ means). For example, here's how we can do (h) (I believe the author meant ""conjugate"" instead of ""congruent""): We use variables $x_i,y_i,z_i,\ldots$. Moreover, if the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ are bound, we write $\overline{x}=x_1\ldots x_k$. Given variables $x,y_1,\ldots,y_k$, let's write:
$$x\in\langle \overline{y}\rangle:\bigvee_{n<\omega}\exists z_1\ldots z_n\left[\left[\bigwedge_{1\leq i\leq n}\bigvee_{1\leq j\leq k}(z_i=y_j)\lor (z_i=y_j^{-1})\right)\land x=z_1\cdots z_n\right]$$
which can be read, in the language of groups, as ""$x$ belongs to the subgroup generated by the $y_i$"". We can also write a formula for two finitely generated subgroups to be isomorphic: Consider variables $p_1,p_2,\ldots$, and all terms $t(\overline{p})$ in the language of groups which have only these variables. There are only countably many of these terms. Say we have variables $x_1\ldots x_k$ and $z_1\ldots z_k$. We write
$$\langle\overline{x}\rangle\simeq\langle\overline{z}\rangle:\bigwedge_{t(\overline{p})}(t(\overline{x})=1\leftrightarrow t(\overline{z})=1),$$
where $t(\overline{x})$ means that we change each occurence of the variable $p_i$ by $x_{i\bmod k}$, and similarly for $t(\overline{z})$. The formula above states that the maps $x_i\mapsto z_i$ extends to an isomorphism of the generated subgroups. Finally, the condition in the exercise can be expressed by
$$\bigwedge_{n<\omega}\forall x_1\ldots x_n,z_1\ldots,z_n\left[\langle\overline{x}\rangle\simeq\langle\overline{z}\rangle\rightarrow\exists g\left(\bigwedge_{1\leq i\leq k}gx_ig^{-1}\in\langle\overline{z}\rangle\land g^{-1}z_ig\in\langle\overline{x}\rangle\right)\right]$$
and the conjunction of this sentence with the usual group axioms is a formula in $L_{\omega_1\omega}$ which works. EDIT: Here are a few solutions for some of the items. Item (b): A ring is a PID iff every finitely generated ideal is principal, or equivalently iff every $2$-generated ideal is principal (Bézout domain), and it is a UFD (item (a)). All of these can be written in $L_{\omega_1\omega}$. Item (d): first recall given a ring $R$, the ideal generated by some $x\in R$ is $(x)=\left\{ax+xb+cxd:a,b,c,d\in R\right\}$, and $R$ is simple iff it is the ideal generated by any nonzero element. Thus a semisimple ring is one for which there are $n$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, with $(x_i)\cap (x_j)=0$ if $i\neq j$, and for which $(x_i)=(x)$ for any $x\in (x_i)$. These can all be written in $L_{\omega_1\omega}$. Item (e): A ring $R$ is left coherent iff every finitely generated ideal is finitely presented. We can restate this as follows: For every $n$ and for every $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, there exist $m$ and terms $t_1(\overline{x}^1,\overline{p}),\ldots,t_m(\overline{x}^m,\overline{p})$, of the form $t_i(\overline{x}^i,\overline{p})=x^i_1p_1+\cdots+x^i_np_n$ (where $x^i_j$ and $p_j$ are variables) in the language of rings, and there exist $r^i_j\in R$, $1\leq i\leq m$, $1\leq j\leq n$, for which $t_i(\overline{r}^i,\overline{a})=0$ for all $i$, and such that for every $s_1,\ldots,s_n$, if $s_1a_1+\cdots+s_na_n=0$ then there are $q_1,\ldots,q_m$ such that for each $i$ $s_i=\sum_jq_jr_i^j$. This means that the relations $t_i(\overline{r},\overline{p})=0$, which make sense for left $R$-modules, are satisfies by the generators $a_i$, the map from the free module generated by $p_1,\ldots,p_n$, mapping $p_i\mapsto a_i$, has precisely the module generated by $t_i(\overline{r},\overline{p})$ as its kernel.","['model-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

1959997,Do the conditional probabilities of equivalent measures merge in total variation?,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space equipped with a strictly increasing filtration $(\mathcal{F}_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be probability measures on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Suppose $P$ and $Q$ are equivalent in the sense that $P(A) = 0$ iff $Q(A) = 0$ for all $A \in \mathcal{F}$. Does the following result hold? $\sup_{A \in \mathcal{F}}|P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_{n}) - Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_{n})| \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ almost surely with respect to $P$ and $Q$. ADDENDUM : Suppose that $\mathcal{F}_n \nearrow \mathcal{F}$. By the Levy 0-1 Law, both $P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)$ and $Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)$ tend to $\mathbf{1}_A$ almost surely. So for this case, all that needs to be shown is that $P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)$ and $Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)$ tend to $\mathbf{1}_A$ uniformly in $A$. ADDENDUM 2 : Here is an attempt at a solution for the case $\mathcal{F}_n \nearrow \mathcal{F}$. I would appreciate feedback. We show that $|P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n) - Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)|$ is bounded by a quantity that is independent of $A$ and that tends to $0$ as $n \to \infty$. Let $q = dQ/dP$, and abuse notation by writing $A = \mathbf{1}_A$. It's easy to show using the basic properties of conditional expectations that $$E_Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n) = E_P(Aq \mid \mathcal{F}_n)(E_P(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n))^{-1}.$$ Hence, omitting the subscript from $E_P$ henceforth, we have
$$P(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n) - Q(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n) = \frac{E(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n) -  E(Aq \mid \mathcal{F}_n)}{E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)}.$$ By the equivalence of $P$ and $Q$, $q >0$ a.s., and $E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n) \to q$ a.s. by the Levy 0-1 Law. It suffices to show that the numerator on the RHS tends to $0$ uniformly in $A$. Using the basic properties of conditional expectations again, we find after some manipulation that $$|E(Aq \mid \mathcal{F}_n) - E(A \mid \mathcal{F}_n)E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| = |E[A(q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)) \mid \mathcal{F}_n]| \\ \leq E[|A(q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n))| \mid \mathcal{F}_n] \leq E[|q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| \mid \mathcal{F}_n].$$ Now, $E[|q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| \mid \mathcal{F}_n]$ is independent of $A$. Moreover, $|q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| \to 0$ as $n \to \infty $ because $E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n) \to q$. Finally, 
$$|q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| \leq |q| + \sup_n(|E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)|) = : Z$$ and $EZ < \infty$ because $\{ E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n) \}$ is uniformly integrable and hence bounded in $L^1$. The dominated convergence theorem for conditional expectation now yields $$E[|q - E(q \mid \mathcal{F}_n)| \mid \mathcal{F}_n] \to 0,$$ and we are done.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-theory', 'proof-verification', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"

1960412,Approximation of curvature of arbitrary plane curve,"Let $S$ be the area (if finite) of the region bounded by a plane curve and a straight line parallel to the tangent line to the curve at a point on the curve, and at a distance $h$ from it. Express $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} (S^2/h^3)$ in terms of the curvature of the curve. The first idea occur to me about this problem is that at a given point on the curve we can define an osculating circle , and that the area bounded by the circle and the straight line will tend to $S$ as $h \rightarrow 0$. The latter statement, however, I am not really sure how to prove or even whether it's true. Based on the assumption that such claim is valid, one can calculate the wanted limit by following expressions (see the following figure) and L'Hospital's rule
\begin{gather}
h = R(1 - \cos(\theta/2)) \\
S \approx \frac{R}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta)),
\end{gather}
where $R = 1/\kappa$, $\kappa$ is the curvature of the curve at the point, and $h(\theta) \rightarrow 0$ as  $\theta \rightarrow 0$. For the justification I owed to everyone: Reorient the curve to center the given point at the origin of new coordinate system, such that its tangent vector is point at the $+x$-direction and the normal vector the $+y$-dircection. (See the diagram.) Let the straight line be $y = h$ with $0 \leq h \leq R = 1/\kappa$. Locally we can parametrise the curve by its $x$-coordinate, i.e. $\mathbf{r}(x) = (x, f(x))$, for some interval of $x$ containing the origin, such that $f(x)$ is a smooth function. Note that we have (due to our orientation of curve) $f(0) = 0, f'(0) = 0$ and $ f''(0) = \kappa$. Hence we have the Taylor expansion $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\kappa x^2 + C x^3 + \dots$, for some constant $C$. For $|x| \leq R$, we have the equation for the circle $g(x) = R - \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$. Expanded by power series $g(x) = \frac{1}{2R} x^2 + D x^3 + \dots$, where $D$ is some constant. If $y = h$ is close enough to our $x$-axis, by inverse function theorem, we shall find smooth functions $a(h)$ and $b(h)$ such that $f(a(h)) = h = g(b(h))$, and that $a, b \rightarrow 0$ as $h \rightarrow 0$. Now we can approximate the difference between the area $S'$ bounded by g(x) and $y =h $ and $S$:

|S'-S| = 2\left|\int_{0}^{a(h)} g(x) - f(x) dx + \int_{a(h)}^{b(h)} h - f(x) dx\right| \\
\leq 2\left| \int_{0}^a Ex^3 + \dots dx \right| + 2|h||b(h) - a(h)| \\
\leq 2\left[ Fa^4 + O(a^5) \right] + 2|h||b(h)-a(h)|,
\end{multline}
where $E ,F$ are constants. This will tend to zero if we let $h$ shrink to zero, which completes my argument.",['differential-geometry']
1960472,Showing existence of a subsequence,"The question is one from the previous analysis preliminary exam: Let $(M, d)$ be a compact metric space and $z ∈ M$. Let
  $T : M → M $ be a function which satisfies 
  $$
d(x, y) ≤ d(T(x), T(y))$$
  for all 
  $x, y \in M,$ i.e. the
  distances are non-decreasing under the mapping T. Define {$x_n$} by
  $x_1 = T(z)$ and $ x_{n+1} = T(x_n)$ for $n ≥ 1.$
  Prove that there exists a sub sequence of {$x_n$} which converges to $z$. I saw some parallels between this question and to show that an isomtery on a compact set to itself is a surjection So I assumed that there is no subsequence which converges to $z$  and therefor there exist $n_o \in \Bbb N $ and $\epsilon$  such that  $d(x_m,z) >\epsilon $ for each  $ m>n_{0}$ And can I say that the sequence therefore has no convergent subsequnece? and I get $\epsilon< d(x_{m-n},z)=d(z,T^{m-n}(z))≤d(x_n, x_m) $ whenever $m-n>n_{0}$ However i am not totally convinced if I have done everything correctly and also that if the result follows from string of inequalities necessarily . Any help would be appreciated","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
1960558,Constructing a planar shape with area $\pi^2$,"Is there a planar shape which can be defined using only algebraic numbers and basic shapes (line, polygon, circle, parabola, etc.), which has an area of $\pi^2$? (I know this isn't a well-posed question, but what I'm interested in is whether there is any ""simple"" geometric construction which has an area of $\pi^2$. You may restate the problem if you think there is a better way of phrasing it). (Also, I would rather that the shape be constructed in a finite number of steps, so no limits...)","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"
1960578,Count the number of possible passwords given that they consist of a combination of $6-8$ lowercase letters and digits with at least one digit [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How many ways can you create a password of 10 characters long that has at least one lowercase letter (a-z) and at least one number ($0-9$)? (2 answers) Closed last year . I was wondering if someone could explain to me how to approach this question as I am quite confused. An online portal requires a user login with a password which must be from $6$ to $8$ characters long, where each character is a lowercase letter or a digit. A password must contain at least $1$ digit. How many possible passwords are there? Thank you :)","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1960605,How fast do iterated exponentiation converge?,"Iterated exponentiation is defined by 
$$x \mapsto x^{x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}$$
or more conveniently, we denote by $^rx$ the expression $\underbrace{x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{x}}}}}}_{r \text{ times}}$. Let us define the function 
$$\begin{array}{cccc}
f_x:& \mathbb{N}& \to & \mathbb{R}\\
& r & \mapsto & ^rx.
\end{array} $$
Euler proved that $\lim_{r \to \infty} f_x(r)$ exists for real numbers $x \in [e^{-e}, e^{1/e}]$ ([1]) (there is a convergence result in $\mathbb{C}$, but I am only interested in real numbers here). Now we consider the Lambert $W$ function , which is defined to be the function satisfying 
$$W(z)e^{W(z)} = z.$$
Then we know from [1] that when $f_x$ converges, it converges to 
$$\lim_{r \to \infty} f_x(r) = \frac{W(-\ln(x))}{-\ln(x)}.$$ My question is: Given $\epsilon > 0$, how can we determine $r_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\left|f_x(r_0) - \frac{W(-\ln(x))}{-\ln(x)} \right| < \epsilon$? Is it possible to solve this algebraically, or is it only possible to do it numerically?","['limits', 'convergence-divergence', 'hyperoperation', 'tetration', 'power-towers']"
1960690,Antenna adjustment: A real-life problem -- solving for a factor when only a change is known,"I'm an amateur radio operator, and part of this involves making antennas. One of the simplest is a dipole, which requires two pieces of wire. The total length of these is given by the formula: Total length (in metres) = $143$ / Frequency (in MHz) You then divide this number by two (and usually add a bit for safety as it's easier to cut wire off the end than add more) and cut your wires. $143$ is a ""standard constant"". In the real world, this number varies due to a variety of factors and has to be measured by experimentation. Essentially by raising and lowering the antenna, cutting a bit off each time. It's really quite time-consuming. Here's the problem I'd like to solve: My measuring instruments are limited to a ruler and a metre stick. So I can measure long distances (metres) with poor accuracy, and short distances (up to $60$ cm) with good accuracy. In other words, if I've cut a wire to $14.2$m, it's probably $15$ or $14.7$ or something (but both wires will be equal because I've used one to cut the other). Conversely, if I've cut $15$cm off the end of a wire, I know that I've cut $15$cm off, and that it's accurate, because it's a single measurement. Here's the problem I'd like to solve: Let's say I have a magical instrument which tells me the frequency of my antenna (this is a real thing: it's called an antenna analyser). This tells my that my antenna works at $F1$. I don't know what the length truly is, so $L1$ is unknown. Now I cut a known length of wire off the end of each leg of my antenna (it has to be symmetrical). Let's say $15$cm. Now I have a new, higher, resonant frequency measurement, $F2$. Knowing $F1$, $F2$ and the change in length, is it possible to calculate the value of the ""constant"" $143$, to get a better idea what my next change in length should be? In actuality, the length starts out as (L + n), then changes to (L + n - c); where L = the 'wanted' length, n is an unknown offset, and c is the amount we cut off (which we know because we measured it accurately). My goal here is to go from time-consuming ""successive approximation"" to a method which allows the antenna to be raised and lowered an absolute minimum number of times. Is this possible? I've had a go with dividing the deltas between the lengths and frequencies, but the numbers I get don't make sense to me.",['analysis']
1960726,$A \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $A$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$,"For 2 topological spaces $(X,T_X)$ and $(Y,T_Y)$, I write $X \simeq Y$ if $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. If $A \subset X$, I always endow $A$ with the subspace topology. I wonder if it is true that : $\exists A \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $A \simeq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$. It doesn't hold for connected sets (i.e intervals, either because $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ would not be connected or one of $A$ or $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ would not be connected after removing a point whereas the other one may still be), nor for compact sets (as $\mathbb{R}$ would be the union of two compact sets, so compact), nor for countable or co-countable sets (as $A$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus A$ would have different cardinalities). If this is true, I wonder if moreover : $\exists A \subset \mathbb{R}$ open such that $A \simeq \mathbb{R} \setminus A$. Thanks.",['general-topology']
