1941701,Relation between the eigenvalues of a matrix A and the eigenvalues of its hermitian and skew-hermitian parts,"It is well know that every matrix $A\in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ can be decomposed in a unique way as a sum of its hermitian part $H$ and its skew-hermitian part $K$:  $$A=\frac{A+A^*}{2}+\frac{A-A^*}{2}$$ However, there is a relationship between the eigenvalues of $A$, $H$ and $K$ that IÂ´m trying to prove without success: If the spectrums of $A, H, K$ are $\sigma(A)= \{ \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n  \}$, $\sigma(H)= \{ \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n \}$, $\sigma(K)= \{ \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n  \},$ then $$\sum_{i=1}^n\mathopen|\lambda_i\mathclose|^2\leqslant \sum_{i=1}^n\mathopen|\alpha_i\mathclose|^2+ \sum_{i=1}^n\mathopen|\beta_i\mathclose|^2$$ With equality $\text{iff}$ $A$ is normal.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

1941758,Sum and Product of n-positive integers,"If I have  $ n $-positive integers, and I compute their sum and product, is there any different group of $ n $-positive integers that will have the same sum and product? For example, if $ a,...,z $ denote 26 positive integers, and we define: \begin{align}
a+b+c+d+....+z &= \text{Sum} \\
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot .... \cdot z &= \text{Product}
\end{align} Is there any way I can get the same Sum and Product from a different group of 26 (in this example) positive integers? EDIT: A friend of mine pointed out that knowing that we have a group of 3 that works, we can show that it works for all positive groups of $ n $ integers. For Example:
$ \{3,3,10 \} $ and $ \{2,5,9 \} $ both yield Sum $=16 $ and Product $=90 $. Now we can just continually add a number (let's say 1) as the next integer to get multiple solutions for $ n =4,5,6,... $. Explicitly, $ \{ 3,3,10,1 \} $ and  $ \{ 2,5,9,1 \} $ both give Sum$=17$ and Product$=90$.",['number-theory']
1941765,Are my calculations of a recursive prime-generating function based on logarithms correct?,"I am trying to devise a recursive prime-generating function following an intuition of a possible analogy to Mills and Wright prime-representing functions, in the present case based on logarithms. The proposed prime generating function $f(n)$ will provide not a subset but the complete set of primes being $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$... and the prime-generating constant will be called $L$. As in the standard results from Mills and Wright the decimal precision of the constant is important in order to recover the embedded primes and it is not known if 
  $\lim_{n \to \infty} L_n$ is rational or not. This is how it works and the questions are at the end: Start with $n=1$, current prime $p_1=2$, previous accumulated value of the constant will be defined as $L_0=0$ (starting value). Calculate the value for the constant for $n=1$. It will be $$L_1=\frac{Ln(2+L_0)}{Ln(1+1)}$$ (Where $Ln$ is the natural logarithm). Calculate the value for the constant for $n=2$, $p_2=3$, $$L_2=\frac{Ln(3+L_1)}{Ln(2+1)}$$ So if we apply recursively the formula, for $n$: $$L_n=\frac{Ln(p_n+L_{n-1})}{Ln(n+1)}$$ For instance, the following PARI_GP code calculates $L_{500}$ \p2000;
testlimit=500;current_pr=2;L=0;for(n=1,testlimit,L=log(current_pr+L)/log(n+1);current_pr=nextprime(current_pr+1););print(""n is "",testlimit,"" and L is "",L); $$L_{500} = 1.3159864456...$$ Reviewing the results of the tests, it seems that $\lim_{n \to \infty} L_n$ 
oscillates (due to the gaps between primes applied in the formula) but in the long term it is stable and tends to decrease and goes down to a value closer to $1$ and lower than $2$. For example: \p3;
testlimit=500000;current_pr=2;L=0;for(n=2,testlimit,L=log(current_pr+L)/log(n);current_pr=nextprime(current_pr+1););print(""n is "",testlimit,"" and L is "",L); $L_{5000}$ is around $1.23...$ and the above code shows that $L_{500000}$ is around $1.21$. Other similar tests show that it tends to go down to some specific limit near the lower bound of $[1,2]$. As the proccess of recovering the primes is recursive, the way of using the constant is as follows: For instance, assuming that we have $L_{500}$, we need to start obtaining the last prime back: $$f(500)=p_{500}=\lfloor (500+1)^{L_{500}} \rfloor - 1 = 3571$$ Then recover $L_{499}$ and recover $f(499)=p_{499}$ $$L_{499}=((500+1)^{L_{500}})-p_{500}=1.31586811...$$ $$f(499)=p_{499}=\lfloor (499+1)^{L_{499}} \rfloor - 1 = 3559$$ $$...$$ So in general the recursive process to recover $L_{n}$ and $f(n)=p_n$ from $L_{n+1}$ and $f(n+1)=p_{n+1}$ is: $$L_{n}=((n+2)^{L_{n+1}})-p_{n+1}$$ $$f(n)=p_{n}=\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor - 1$$ The following code, having $L_{500}$ calculates backwards the complete set of primes $\{p_{500}..p_{1}\}$ curr_L=L;for(n=1,testlimit,curr_n=testlimit-n+2;curr_p=(floor(curr_n^curr_L))-1;print(""n is "",testlimit-n+1,"" ; Current prime is "",curr_p,"" and is_prime check = "",isprime(curr_p));curr_L=(curr_n^curr_L)-curr_p;); There is a little correction required for the calculation of $p_1$. Depending on the $L_n$ calculated, sometimes the recovered value $\lfloor (2)^{L_{1}} \rfloor = 2$ instead of $3$. And for that reason, when the value is $2$, $f(1)=p_{1}=\lfloor (2)^{L_{1}} \rfloor - 1 = 2-1 = 1$ instead of the expected $p_1=2$. To handle this special case, we can express the prime-generating function as: $$f(n)=p_{n}=\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor - 1 + \delta_{f(n),2}$$ Where $\delta_{f(n),2}$ is the Kronecker delta function (kindly provided by @MitchellSpector in this question ). Basically it is a little trick that will assure that always $f(1)=2$ independently of the value of $\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor$ ($2$ or $3$). It would be possible a definitions-by-case of $f(n)$ as well instead of using one single expression. This is a graph of the evolution of $L_n$ (only four decimals of precision): I would like to ask the following questions: Are the calculations correct or is there a mistake in the assumptions? How could I prove that $L_n$ is decreasing in the long term and 
  there is indeed a limit? The tests show that but I am a little bit lost about
  how to demonstrate that it really is decreasing (because each step depends
  on the gaps between primes). A hint about the starting step would be great! Initially I think this kind of recursive prime-generating function is a little bit different from the original results of Mills and towers of powers of Wright, but it might be possible that a similar idea had been explored before in recent literature. Initially I did not find such references. Are there similar solutions as the one I am devising? Any references to papers would be very appreciated. Thank you!","['proof-verification', 'number-theory', 'constants', 'prime-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"
1941782,uncountable union of uncountable sets and the usage of the axiom of choice,"I've been facing the next problem: $\alpha$ is an ordinal, show that there is no cardinals collection $\{\beta_i\}$, when $i\in I$. Such as: $\sum_I  \beta_i=\aleph_{\alpha+1}$. When $|I|<\aleph_{\alpha+1}$ and for all $i\in I$, $\beta_i < \aleph_{\alpha+1}$. My first question. Before I got to my current soultion (will be represented immediately) I was trying to solve it using konig inequality , and also tried to find elegant explanation using cardinals definiton, cause $\aleph_{\alpha+1}$ is also an ordinal. I couldn't make it, and I would really like to get any solution using those principles. In my current solution I was trying generalizing the lemma about countable union of countable set, my solution arises a doubt about my usage and understanding of the axiom of choice, I would be grateful for you comments and opinion about it. So, my solution: $|I|<\aleph_{\alpha+1} $ and for for all $i \in I$, $\beta_i <\aleph_{\alpha+1} $, so the largest result of $\sum_I\beta_i $ is when the collection $\{\beta_i\}_I $ cardinality is $\aleph_{\alpha}$ and $I$ carindality is also $\aleph_{\alpha}$. Now I want to prove that the cardinality of $\aleph_{\alpha}$ union of sets with cardinality $\aleph_{\alpha}$ is also $\aleph_{\alpha}$ Let $\{B_i\}_I $ be a collection of set with cardinality $\aleph_{\alpha}$ (representing the $\{\beta_i\}_I $ caridnals collection).
Given set $A$ with cardinality $\aleph_{\alpha}$, there is a bijection $g_I : I \to A$ and a set of bijections $f_i: B_i\to A$.
Now we define new collection of sets composed of $\{i\}\times B_i $ (each and every $i$ with its respective $B_i$). We define a one-to-one function $H:\bigcup(\{i\}\times B_i) \to A\times A$, when $H((i,b))=(g_I(i),f_i(b))$. the function is one to one, cause for $(i_1,b_1)\neq (i_2,b_2)\Rightarrow$ assuming $i_1 \neq i_2\Rightarrow g_I(i_1)\neq g_I(i_2)$ cause $g_i$ is a bijection, while in case $i_1 = i_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2\Rightarrow f_i(b_1)\neq f_i(b_2)$, also cause $f_i$  is a bijection. So now we know that $|\bigcup (\{i\}\times B_i)|\le |A\times A|$.
Using the axiom of choice I want to show that $|\bigcup B_I|\le|\bigcup (\{i\}\times B_i)| $ The axiom of choice promises existence of a function $C : \bigcup B_i\to I$ such that for each $ b\in \bigcup B_i, C(b) = i$ when $b\in B_i$. Now using $C$, we define $ F: \bigcup B_I \to \bigcup (\{i\}\times B_i), F(b)  = (C(b),b) $. This, function is one-to-one cause for $b_1\neq b_2\Rightarrow (C(b_1),b_1)\neq (C(b_2),b_2)$, no matter how $C$ function operates upon $b_i$ elements. so from transitivity  $|\bigcup B_i|\le|\bigcup (\{i\}\times B_i)|\le |A\times A|$. And a known result about infinite sets which derives from ZL, $|A\times A|= |A|=\aleph_{\alpha}$. While, for a $B_0\in \{B_i\}_I, B_0 \subseteq \bigcup B_I\Rightarrow |B_0|\le|\bigcup B_I|$, so from CSB: $\aleph_{\alpha}=|B_0|\le|\bigcup B_I|\le|A\times A|=\aleph_{\alpha}$. What conclusively means that $\sum_I\{\beta_i\} \le \aleph_{\alpha}<\aleph_{\alpha+1}$","['cardinals', 'ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
1941786,"Example of a Distribution that is not symmetric, but has a skewness of zero.","In my probably class we saw that if a distribution is symmetric then the skewness will be zero. Intuitively this makes sense to me since if a data set is symmetric than for each point that is distance 'd' above the mean there will be a point that is distance 'd' below the mean (Although, in practice this is probably just very close to zero and actually zero). However, it was implied in class that the converse is not true. That is, there may exist a distribution which is not symmetric, or skewed, but the skewness is zero. Can anyone give me an actual example of a distribution that is skewed, but the values of the skewness equals zero? Cheers","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1941831,"Understanding a proof of ""Every set has a group structure implies Axiom of Choice""","I am following this answer by Asaf to a question, whether every set has a group structure. The main part is the following: To prove that ""every set can be made into a group $\Rightarrow$ Axiom of choice"" Given an infinite set $X$ we define $H(X)$ to be the least ordinal $\alpha$ that there is no injection $g:\alpha\to X$ (this is known as the Hartog number of $X$) If $X$ can be injected into $H(X)$ then $X$ can be well ordered, since being injected into an ordinal means that $X$ inherits a well order. Using the assumption that every set can be given a group structure we give a group structure to $X\cup H(X)$, and from this we deduce that there exists an injection from $X$ into $H(X)$. Therefore if every set can be given a group structure, every set can be well ordered and therefore the axiom of choice holds. With this (part o answer), I have a very simple question, which came to me while considering necessaties of the objects used in the arguments. What is the necessity of taking ""$H(X)$, least ordinal etc"" , in the arguments? I mean, can we take simply $\mathcal{P}(X)$, the power set of $X$, instead of these objects ""$H(X)$, least ordinal "" in the arguments, and carry proof?","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-explanation']"

I want to prove that if $p$ is prime then $\Bbb Z_p$ is a field. Known facts about the quotient rings of the kind $\Bbb Z_n$ (I dont list all the characteristics of a ring, just some ones): They are commutative rings with unity. $[0]=[n]$ is the identity of addition or zero. Then $[n]+[a]=[a]$ and $[n]\cdot[a]=[n]$ for all $[a]\in\Bbb Z_n$ . $[1]$ is the multiplicative identity or unity. Then $[1]\cdot[a]=[a]$ for all $[a]\in\Bbb Z_n$ . The addition is defined as $[a]+[b]=[a+b]$ , and the multiplication is defined as $[a]\cdot[b]=[ab]$ . $[a]=[b]$ means that exists $z\in\Bbb Z$ such that $a=b+nz$ . $|\Bbb Z_p|=p$ . A ring $\Bbb Z_p$ dont have zero divisors , i.e. doesnt exist $[a],[b]\in\Bbb Z_p$ distinct of $[p]$ such that $[a]\cdot[b]=[p]$ .

Then exist some $z_j\in\Bbb Z$ such that: $$(a+pz_1)(b+pz_2)=pz_3\iff ab+pz_4=pz_3\iff ab=pz_5$$ but this is a contradiction with the assumption that $a,b\neq p$ and $p$ prime, so dont exist divisors of zero on any $\Bbb Z_p$ . $\Box$ For any $[a]\in\Bbb Z_p$ distinct of $[p]$ exist $[b]$ such that $[a][b]=[1]$ . Because $\Bbb Z_p$ dont have zero divisors and is finite for some $[a]\neq[p]$ we have that if $[b]\neq[c]$ then $[a][b]\neq[a][c]$ .

But $pz_3\in[p]$ , then $[a][c-b]=[p]$ but because there are no zero divisors in $\Bbb Z_p$ then or $[a]=[p]$ or $[c-b]=[p]$ what contradicts the above conditions. $\Box$ Because $[a][b]\neq[a][c]$ for $[a]\neq[p]$ and $[b]\neq[c]$ then for any $[a]\neq[p]$ we have that $$[a]\cdot\Bbb Z_p=\Bbb Z_p\implies \exists [b]\in\Bbb Z_p:[a][b]=[1]$$ In other words: every element of $\Bbb Z_p$ but $[p]$ have a multiplicative inverse as stated above. $\Box$ Because $\Bbb Z_p$ is a commutative ring with $[1]\neq[0]$ and have multiplicative inverse for all their elements but $[p]=[0]$ then $\Bbb Z_p$ is a field. $\Box$","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'solution-verification']"

1941994,Derivative of the binomial $\binom x n$ with respect to $x$,"My background is not mathematics and I need to implement (in C++) the derivative of a binomial, with wxMaxima and wolfram.alpha as a helper. So far, the binomial can be written as:
$$\binom x n = \frac 1 {n!}\prod_{k=1}^n (x-k+1)$$
This reduces to a continued convolution. For my specific needs, the binomial needs to be of the form:
$$\binom{\frac{n+1}{2}x+\frac{n-1}{2}}{n}$$
But I also need the derivative of it, which wxMaxima solves as
$$-\frac{1}{2}(n+1) \,\left( \psi_0\left( \frac{(n+1) x-n+1} 2 \right) -\psi_0 \left( \frac{(n+1) \,(x+1) }{2}\right) \right) \,\begin{pmatrix}\frac{( n+1) x+n-1}{2}\\ n
\end{pmatrix}$$ while wolfram goes a bit further and, instead of $\psi_0$ gives $H_n$, which they call harmonic number . ( this link ). That $\psi$ seems to have quite an involved formula, but $H_n$,as functions.wolfram has it, is a simple $\sum_{k=1}^n 1/k$, which is a lot simpler in terms of C++. Now, because I have trust issues, I went on to verify the answer given by wolfram, in wxMaxima, for $n=4$. Here's the code: n:4$

h:-(n+1)/2*binomial((n+1)/2*(x+1)-1,n)*(sum(1/k,k,1,(n+1)/2*(x-1))-sum(1/k,k,1,1/2*(n*(x+1)+x-1)));
wxplot2d([g,h],[x,0,1]); and here's the output of it: plot As you can see, they don't match; plotting wxMaxima's derivation is a match, but that involves $\psi$ as an infinite sum. So I'm left wondering what's wrong: is the implementation of the harmonic number? Is the derivation formula? Is it the way I transcribed it? TL;DR: I need a derivation formula (not the actual code, that's up to me) for the binomial that is (fairly) simple to implement and doesn't take ages to compute, in C++, as the whole function will be called in a bracketed root-finding algorithm. And I'm also using GMP from gmplib dot org (need 10 rep to post more than 2 links). Following G Cab 's excellent post, and modifying the formulas according to my needs, I managed to come up (with a bit of hammering) to this formula: $$\frac{d}{dx}\binom{\frac{n+1}{2}x+\frac{n-1}{2}}{n}=(-1)^n \frac{n+1}{2} \binom{\frac{n+1}{2}x + \frac{n-1}{2}}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{\frac{n+1}{2}x +\frac{n-1}{2}-k}$$ The $(-1)^n$ takes care of odd $n$.

  $$\left|\frac 12f+\frac 12 g\right|^p\le \left|\frac 12|f|+\frac 12|g|\right|^p$$
  for any $f,g\in L^p$. Since $x \mapsto x^p$ is convex, we have
  $$
\left(\frac 12|f|+\frac 12|g|\right)^p \le \frac 12|f|^p+\frac 12|g|^p.
$$
  Substituting $f,g$ in places of $\frac 12f,\frac12 g$ yields
  $$
\left|f+g\right|^p \le 2^{p-1}\left(|f|^p+|g|^p \right)
$$
  so $f+g\in L^p$. Observe that for $q$ satisfying $\frac 1q + \frac 1p=1$,
  $$\begin{align}
|f+g|^p &\le |f+g|^{p-1}(|f|+|g|) \\ 
\int|f+g|^p  &\le \int|f||f+g|^{p-1} + \int|g||f+g|^{p-1} \\
&= ||f\cdot (f+g)^p ||_1 + ||g\cdot (f+g)^p ||_1 \\
||f+g||^p_p&\le ||f||_p ||(f+g)^{p-1}||_q + ||g||_p ||(f+g)^{p-1}||_q
\end{align}$$
  by Holder inequality. Now, since $(p-1)q=p$ we have
  $$\begin{align}
||(f+g)^{p-1}||_q &= \left(\int |f+g|^{(p-1)q}\right)^{\frac 1q} \\
& =\left(\int |f+g|^p\right)^{\frac 1q} \\
&= ||f+g||_p^{p/q}.
\end{align}$$
  By cancellation on both side of $$||f+g||^p_p\le ||f||_p ||(f+g)^{p-1}||_q + ||g||_p ||(f+g)^{p-1}||_q$$ and noting that $p-p/q=1$, we have
  $$ ||f+g||_p \le ||f||_p + ||g||_p $$
  as required. Yes, each step is clear and not hard to understand. However, it seems magical to me at several steps and I cannot intuitively follow the logical flow of the proof. The proof of Holder inequality via Jensen inequality seems quite natural to me, unlike this one. I'll try to be more specific: My questions Why should I expect that the splitting $|f+g|^p$ into $|f+g|^{p-1}(|f|+|g|)$ should be fruitful? We utilized the fact that $(p-1)q=p$ and $p-p/q=1$. While it is not hard to verify them algebraically, is there an intuitive reason to anticipate them beforehand? What is the intuitive/geometric relation between the conjugate pair $p,q$ beside from their algebraic relation $\frac 1q+\frac 1p =1$? I know that $(l^p)^*=l^q$ but I am not sure how it might help. In general, I just want a better grasp at Minkowski inequality. Any contribution would be really appreciated even if it does not address all of my question.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'inequality', 'soft-question']"
1942006,Why is it considered that $(\mathrm d x)^2=0$?,"Why is it okay to consider that $(\mathrm d x)^n=0$ for any n greater than $1$?
I can understand that $\mathrm d x$ is infinitesimally small ( but greater than $0$ ) and hence its square or cube should be approximately equal to $0$ not exactly $0$ . But if this is so then how can we expect the results obtained from calculus to be exact and not just approximate ( like the slope or area under a curve )? I have also noticed some anomalies, like $\sqrt{ (\mathrm d x)^2 + (\mathrm d y)^2 }$ is $0$ but $\mathrm d x\sqrt{1+ (\mathrm d y/\mathrm d x)^2 }$ is not $0$ when these two things are apparently the same . Moreover we can  claim that $$(\mathrm d x)^2=(\mathrm d x)^3=(\mathrm d x)^4 = \cdots = 0$$ which is quite hard to believe. Can you help me figure out the logic behind these things ?","['infinitesimals', 'calculus']"
1942064,$(H^2-K) dA$ is globally invariant under inversions,"I am reading a paper by James H. White which states that the Willmore functional is invariant under conformal mappings. Let $M$ be a smooth compact surface and $f:M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ an immersion. The Willmore functional is given by
$$\mathcal{W}(f)=\int_M\;H^2\;dA,$$
where $H$ is the mean curvature and $dA$ is the induced area form. By Liouville's Theorem , all the conformal mappings can be written as combination of euclidean motions, homotheties and inversions in spheres. The fact that $\mathcal{W}$ is invariant under euclidean motions and homotheties is clear. So we have to see how $\mathcal{W}$ behaves under inversions. Since, by Gauss-Bonnet,
$$\int_M (H^2-K)dA=\int_M H^2 dA - 2\pi\chi(M)=\mathcal{W}(f) - 2\pi\chi(M)$$
and $\chi(M)$ is a geometric invariant, we can focus on the quantity $(H^2-K)dA$ and prove what is left for it. So this is what I want to prove: $(H^2-K)dA$ is invariant under inversions. We can assume that the center of the inversion is $0$. If we denote the radius of the inversion by $r$, the position vector of a point on the inverted surface in terms of a point $x\in M$ is given by $$\tilde{x}=r^2{x\over\|x\|^2}.$$ First we observe that the surface form $dA$ changes under the inversion by $d\tilde{A}=\left({r\over\|x\|}\right)^4 dA$. This is easily done. Now, the next step is to compute the principal curvatures of the inverted surface $\tilde{\kappa}_1, \tilde{\kappa}_2$ in terms of $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$. In the mentioned paper, they get the following: $$\tilde{\kappa}_1=-{\|x\|^2\kappa_1-2h\over r^2},\;\tilde{\kappa}_2=-{\|x\|^2\kappa_2-2h\over r^2},$$ where we have set $h=x\cdot N$ with $N$ the surface normal vector. With this calculation the proof is almost done, but I don't know how to get these values for the inverted curvatures. My guess is that I should get first the inverted normal, say $\tilde{N}$, but my calculations get me to $\tilde{N}=\left({r\over\|x\|}\right)^4 N$, which I'm not sure is right. But even if this was the right value of $\tilde{N}$, how could I derive the principal curvatures? Any help is really appreciated.","['curvature', 'invariance', 'conformal-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'surfaces']"

For what values of $y$ will there exist matrices $A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}$ such that $AB-BA=X$? So far using the properties of the trace function, I have deduced that $y$ cannot be non-zero, since $AB-BA=X$ implies $\text{tr}(AB-BA)=\text{tr}(X)$. Since $\text{tr}(AB-BA)=0$, the sum of diagonal elements of $X$ is also $0$. Therefore $1+y+(-1)=0$. How do I show that there exist or does not exist $A,B$ such that $AB-BA=X$, where $y=0$.

1942231,Prove that determinant of a matrix (with polynomial entries) is non-zero,"For $\mathbf x\in\mathbb (0,1)^n$ with $n>2$ and a positive integer $1\le k<n$, define the mapping $f_{i,j}\colon (0,1)^n\rightarrow (0,1)$ by, $$f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathcal A \subset \{ 1,\ldots,n\}\backslash \{i,j\}\\  
|\mathcal A|=k-1}}\quad\left( \prod\limits_{l\not\in \mathcal A\cup \{i,j\} }x_l\,\,\cdot\!\!\!\! \prod\limits_{ l\in \mathcal A}(1-x_l)\right).$$ Convention: if the set of indexes is empty, the product is one. I'm trying to prove that the matrix $$M=\begin{cases} m_{i,j}=f_{i,j}(\mathbf{x})\quad &\text{ if } j\neq i,\\ m_{i,j}=0&\text{ if } j=i\end{cases}$$ has full-rank, i.e. $\det(M)\neq 0$ (for $\mathbf{x}$ in $(0,1)^n$). I proved this for two particular cases: $k=1$, $f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \prod\limits_{ k\neq i,j} x_k$ and so that case is quite easy. Also if $k=n-1$, $f_{i,j}(\mathbf x)= \prod\limits_{ k\neq i,j} (1-x_k)$, which is also an easy case. However, for $1<k<n-1$, I can only solve by using brute force. For example, for $k=2$ and $n=4$, the matrix is: $$\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0 & x_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & x_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2) \\
x_3(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_3) & 0 & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) \\
x_2(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_2) & x_1(1-x_4)+x_4(1-x_1) & 0 & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) \\x_2(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_2)  & x_1(1-x_3)+x_3(1-x_1) & x_1(1-x_2)+x_2(1-x_1) & 0\end{array}\right),$$
and using Mathematica, it can be shown that the determinant of $M$ is not zero for $\mathbf x \in (0,1)^4$. But I'm lost trying to tackle the general case: any suggestions/hints (i.e., they need to be full answers) are very welcome. Update : For several examples $-$ if we set $f_{i,j}(\mathbf x,\mathbf y)= \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathcal A \subset \{ 1,\ldots,n\}\backslash \{i,j\}\\  
|\mathcal A|=k-1}}\quad\left( \prod\limits_{l\not\in \mathcal A\cup \{i,j\} }x_l\,\,\cdot\!\!\!\! \prod\limits_{ l\in \mathcal A}y_l\right)$, and compute the determinante of $M$ above. It is easy to see by inspection that all of terms of $\mathrm{det}(M)$ have the same signal. Perhaps, it would be easier to prove the result for this more general $f_{i,j}$.","['combinatorics', 'polynomials', 'groebner-basis', 'determinant']"

1942618,Balls and Bins Variation (Multiple Rounds),"Consider the following balls and bins experiment: we repeatedly throw a fixed number of balls randomly into a shrinking set of bins. The experiment starts with $n$ balls and $n$ bins. In each round $k,$ we throw $n$ balls into the remaining bins, and then discard any non-empty
bins; thus, only bins that are empty at the end of round $k$ survive to round $k + 1$. What is the expected number of rounds before every bin among the initial $n$ is nonempty? In general, assuming we are conducting the standard balls-and-bins experiment, then given $m$ balls and $n$ bins, we know that the expected number of bins that are empty is $n(1 - \frac{1}{n})^m$. With this in mind, I've attempted to consider each round in the above experiment as an instance of the standard balls into bins problem, and have reformulated the question into an equivalent one, thus: Suppose that for each round, exactly the expected number of bins are empty. Then after how many rounds does the experiment end? However, the expected number formula quickly gets unwieldy. But consider the function defined for any integer $i \geq 0$: $f(i+1) = 2^{f(i)}$ for $i \geq 1$ and $f(0) = 1$ Could I use an induction argument to show that, after round $i$ and before round $i + 1$ (assuming that exactly the expected number of bins are empty for each round), we have that $\frac{n}{f(i+1)} \leq \textit{number of empty bins} < \frac{n}{f(i)}$ and try to tightly bound the solution from above?","['balls-in-bins', 'expectation', 'probability']"

The set of triangular numbers modulo $n$ yields $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ iff $n$ is a power of $2$. My specific question is whether there is a straightforward way to describe this set given, for example, the prime factorization of $n$. But I also have the broader question: What else can be said about the set of triangular numbers modulo $n$ as a function of $n$? For example, when $n$ is odd, we might expect the set to have cardinality around $(n+1)/2$. To illustrate this by way of example, consider $n = 11$, and the first $11$ counting numbers each reduced modulo $11$: $$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0$$ However many distinct elements we have after the first $(n+1)/2$ triangular numbers will be the final total, since (as suggested by the negative notation above) the elements reverse course thereafter, and wend their way back to $0$ at which point they reset as they have formed a cycle. But I am not only interested in an estimate of the cardinality based on $n$'s parity; I am hoping for the whole shebang! In that spirit: Q. How can we describe the set of triangular numbers modulo $n$ given $n$'s prime factorization?","['reference-request', 'number-theory', 'group-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1942823,Is $x * d/dx$ closed on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$?,"More formally, sticking to the one-dimensional case for this problem, let $M_x$ be the multiplication-by-$x$ operator, $$\begin{split} \mathfrak{D}(M_x) &= \lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): x f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \rbrace \\
M_x [f](x) &= x f(x) \end{split},$$ and let $D$ be the differentiation-by-$x$ operator
$$ \begin{split} \mathfrak{D}(D) & = \lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): f^{\prime}(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \rbrace ( = \mathcal{H}^1(\mathbb{R}))\\
D[f](x) &= f^{\prime}(x) \end{split},$$
where we allow $f^{\prime}(x)$ to be a distributional derivative.  (Of course, thanks to the Fourier Transform $\mathcal{F}$, $$Df(x)  = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left[i \xi \mathcal{F}[f](\xi) \right](x),$$
perhaps multiplied by a constant depending on the convention on the Fourier Transform.)  Of course, $M_x$ is closed and self-adjoint (e.g., Reed/Simon, Functional Analysis, Chap. VIII, Section 3, Prop. 1), and $D$ is closed by the same reasoning (being a constant multiple of the self-adjoint $i \frac{d}{dx}$). Question: Is $M_x \circ D$ closed on the natural domain, i.e., $ \mathfrak{D}(M_X \circ D) = \lbrace f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}): f^{\prime}(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}), xf^{\prime}(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \rbrace$ ? Note: Of course, replacing $\frac{d}{dx}$ by $i \frac{d}{dx}$ may be simpler to allow self-adjointness, but I prefer to state it in the more elementary way.  Of course, if the proof is easier with $i \frac{d}{dx}$, then please just use that. Work so far: Let us set up a standard closure proof, so suppose that $f_n(x) \in \mathfrak{D}(M_X \circ D)$ and $f(x) \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ satisfy \begin{align} f_n(x) &\overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} f(x) \tag{1}\\
x f_n^{\prime}(x) &\overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} g(x);  \tag{2} \end{align}
we wish to show that $f(x) \in \mathfrak{D}(M_X \circ D)$ and $x f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} x f^{\prime}(x)$. Claim: It suffices to show that 
$$f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} h(x) \tag{3} $$ for some $L^2$-function $h$. Proof: Suppose that (1), (2), and (3) hold (for some $L^2$ functions $\left(f_n\right)_{n = 1}^{\infty}$, $f$, $g$, and $h$).  By (1), (3), and the closure of $D$, it follows that $f(x) \in \mathfrak{D}(D)$ and $f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} f^{\prime}(x)$, i.e., $h(x) = f^{\prime}(x)$.  Letting $h_n(x) = f_n^{\prime}(x)$, (3) now reads
$$h_n(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} h(x), \tag{3*}$$
and (2) now reads
$$x h_n(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} g(x), \tag{2*}$$
so by the closure of $M_x$, $h \in \mathfrak{D}(M_x)$ and $x h_n(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} x h(x)$, i.e., $g(x) = x h(x)$.  Remembering that $h_n(x) = f_n^{\prime}(x)$ and $h(x) = f^{\prime}(x)$, we have that $f^{\prime}(x) \in \mathfrak{D}(M_x)$, i.e., $f(x) \in \mathfrak{D}(M_x \circ D)$, and $x f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} x f^{\prime}(x)$.  The closure proof is complete. $\square$ Thus, the problem reduces to proving the claim.  Certainly, for any $\delta > 0$, we can define the bounded measurable function $$\varphi_{\delta}(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x}, & |x| \geq \delta \\ 0, & |x| < \delta \end{cases},$$
which as a multiplier of course defines a bounded (hence continuous) linear operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, so applying to (2),
$$\varphi_{\delta}(x) \cdot x f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} \varphi_{\delta}(x) g(x). $$ Of course, $\varphi_{\delta}(x) \cdot x $ is the characteristic function $\mathbb{1}_{|x| \geq \delta}(x)$, so $$ \mathbb{1}_{|x| \geq \delta}(x) \cdot f_n^{\prime}(x) \overset{L^2}{\rightarrow} \varphi_{\delta}(x) g(x). \tag{4} $$ Thus, we seem to have two options: (A) show for some small $\delta$ that $\mathbb{1}_{|x| < \delta}(x) f_n^{\prime}(x)$ also converges to some $L^2$ function, (B) carefully take the limit in (4) as $\delta \to 0$. [I regard (B) as nonobvious: clearly as $\delta \to 0$, for each $n$ separately, the left-hand side tends to $f_n^{\prime}(x)$ in $L^2$-norm, but without any uniformity in $n$, it would be difficult.  Certainly, the right-hand-side will get worse as $\delta \to 0$, without an additional observation.]  Here is where I am stuck.","['functional-analysis', 'differential-operators', 'operator-theory']"
1942857,How can this integral expression for the difference between two $\zeta(s)$s be explained?,"With $z=\sigma + x \, i;\,\, \sigma,x \in \mathbb{R}$, numerical evidence strongly suggests that: $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty} \,\zeta(z)\,\zeta(\overline{z})\,\Gamma(z)\,\Gamma(\overline{z})  \,dx =\pi\,\Gamma(2\,\sigma)\,\big(\zeta(2\,\sigma-1)-\zeta(2\,\sigma)\big)$$ for all $\sigma > 1$. Could this be proven? Just to share that the equation can be extended towards $0<\sigma<1$ by starting from: $$\Gamma(s)\, \zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty x^{s-1}\left(\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}-\frac{1}{x}\right)\,dx$$ and following the same logic as in the answer below. This gives the closed form: $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty} \,\zeta(z)\,\zeta(\overline{z})\,\Gamma(z)\,\Gamma(\overline{z})  \,dx =\pi\,\Gamma(2\,\sigma)\,\left(\frac{(2\,\sigma-3)}{(2\,\sigma-1)} \,\zeta(2\,\sigma-1)-\zeta(2\,\sigma)\right)$$ Note that since $\sigma$ could also be $\in \mathbb{C}$, this implies that when $\rho=2\,\sigma$ or $\rho=2\,\sigma-1$ ($\rho$ = a non-trivial zero of $\zeta(s)$), then the RHS becomes fully multiplicative. The process can be extended indefinitely by for instance starting from $$\Gamma(s)\, \zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty x^{s-1}\left(\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}-\frac{1}{x} +\frac12\right)\,dx$$
which gives for the domain $-1<\sigma<0$ the following closed form: $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty} \,\zeta(z)\,\zeta(\overline{z})\,\Gamma(z)\,\Gamma(\overline{z})  \,dx =\pi\,\left(2\,\sigma-3)\,\Gamma(2\,\sigma-1)\,\zeta(2\,\sigma-1\right)$$ And subsequently for the domain $-2<\sigma<-1$ we start from:
$$\Gamma(s)\, \zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty x^{s-1}\left(\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}-\frac{1}{x} +\frac12-\frac{x}{12}\right)\,dx$$ which gives the closed form: $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\infty} \,\zeta(z)\,\zeta(\overline{z})\,\Gamma(z)\,\Gamma(\overline{z})  \,dx =\pi\,\Gamma(2\,\sigma)\,\left(\frac{(2\,\sigma-3)}{(2\,\sigma-1)} \,\zeta(2\,\sigma-1)-\frac{\sigma}{3}\,\zeta(2\,\sigma+1)\right)$$ Don't think there is an easy pattern or generic formula since Bernoulli numbers are involved.","['number-theory', 'mellin-transform', 'riemann-zeta', 'gamma-function']"
1942859,Proving $\phi$ is convex if and only if $\phi'(x) \leq \phi'(y)$ for all $a < x < y < b$,"I'm an undergraduate student that find a problem for proofing theorem below. First it defined that: A function f defined on an interval (a,b), $-â â¤ a < bâ¤ â$, is said to be a convex function if for all x,y in (a,b) and for all $0 < Î³ < 1$, $$f[Î³x + (1 - Î³)y] â¤ Î³f(x) + (1 - Î³)f(y)$$ 
We say f is strictly convex if the above inequality is strict. The theorem said that, if f is differentiable on (a,b), then 1) f is convex if and only if $f' (x) â¤ f'(y)$, for all $a < x < y < b$, 2) f is strictly convex if and only if $f'(x) < f'(y)$, for all $a < x < y < b$. I try to proof the first part from the left to the right, in this way: a) Let f is differentiable on (a,b), and f is convex. Let $Î³=\frac{(k-j)}{(k-x)}$. The value of Î³ is arbitrary value such that $0<Î³<1$. Choosing x,j,k and y, such that $a < x <j<k< y < b$,
and $j=\frac{(k-j)}{(k-x)} x+\frac{(j-x)}{(k-x)}k$, 
so, by the  definiton of convex 
$$f(j)=f\left(\frac{(k-j)}{(k-x)} x+\frac{(j-x)}{(k-x)} k\right)â¤\frac{(k-j)}{(k-x)} f(x)+\frac{(j-x)}{(k-x)} f(k)$$
Then $(k-x)f(j)â¤(k-j)f(x)+(j-x)f(k)$ $((k-j)+(j-x) )f(j)â¤(k-j)f(x)+(j-x)f(k)$
$(k-j)f(j)+(j-x)f(j)â¤(k-j)f(x)+(j-x)f(k)$
$(k-j)f(j)-(k-j)f(x)â¤(j-x)f(k)-(j-x)f(j)$
$(k-j)[f(j)-f(x) ]â¤(j-x)[f(k)-f(j) ]$ $$\frac{[f(j)-f(x) ]}{(j-x)}â¤\frac{[f(k)-f(j) ]}{(k-j)}$$
Doing the same step for j,k and  y, yields
$$\frac{[f(k)-f(j) ]}{(k-j)}â¤\frac{[f(y)-f(k) ]}{(y-k)}$$
So, we get
$$\frac{[f(j)-f(x) ]}{(j-x)}â¤\frac{[f(k)-f(j) ]}{(k-j)}â¤\frac{[f(y)-f(k) ]}{(y-k)}$$
$$\frac{[f(j)-f(x) ]}{(j-x)}â¤\frac{[f(y)-f(k) ]}{(y-k)}$$ and the last step i was taking the limit jâx for the left side and kây for the right one, yields $ f' (x)=lim_{jâx}â¡\left(\frac{[f(j)-f(x) ]}{(j-x)}\right)â¤lim_{kây}â¡\left(\frac{[f(y)-f(k) ]}{(y-k)}\right)=f' (y) $ is it reasonable to doing this? i have searching for the proof in some reference but i haven't find a clear explanation yet. ones said that the last step

\mu(E_i) \} = \sup \{ \sum_{i=1}^N (\inf _{x_i \in E_i} f(x_i)) \mu(E_i)
\}$ where in 2), the $E_i$'s form a partition of A and the sup is taken
  over all such partitions. I want to prove that they are equivalent. Here is what I did. 1) $\leq$ 2) : take $h$ a simple function such that $h \leq f$. Write $h$ in its canonical form : $h = \sum_i c_i \mathcal{1}_{A_i}$. Since $h \leq f$, we have $c_i \leq f(x_i)$ for all $x_i \in A_i$. Using the definition of the Lebesgue integral for simple functions, we then have $\int_A h d \mu = \sum_i c_i \mu (A_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^N (\inf _{x_i \in A_i} f(x_i)) \mu(A_i) \leq \sup \{ \sum_{i=1}^N (\inf _{x_i \in E_i} f(x_i)) \mu(E_i) \}$, from which we have $\sup _{h \leq f, \space h \space simple} \{ \int_A h d \mu \} \leq \sup \{ \sum_{i=1}^N (\inf _{x_i \in E_i} f(x_i)) \mu(E_i) \}$. 2) $\leq$ 1) : let $E_i$'s be a partition of A, and $\alpha = \sum_i \inf_{x_i \in E_i} \{f(x_i) \} \mu (E_i)$. Fix $\epsilon > 0$. We can choose ($x_i^*)_i$ such that $\inf f(x_i) \leq f(x_i^*) \leq \inf f(x_i) + \epsilon$. We have $\alpha \leq \sum _i f(x_i^*) \mu (E_i)$. We set $h^* = \sum _i (f(x_i^*) - \epsilon) \mathcal{1}_{E_i}$. Then $h^* = \sum _i (f(x_i^*) - \epsilon) \mathcal{1}_{E_i} \leq \sum _i (\inf_{x_i \in E_i} f(x_i)) \mathcal{1}_{E_i} \leq f$. We also have $\int_A h^* d \mu = \sum_i (f(x_i^*) - \epsilon) \mu (E_i) = \sum_i (f(x_i^*) \mu (E_i) - \epsilon \mu (A) $. 
So $\alpha \leq \int_A h^* d \mu + \epsilon \mu(A) \leq \sup _{h \leq f, \space h \space simple} \{ \int_A h d \mu \} + \epsilon \mu (A)$.
Take $\epsilon \to 0$ so that $\alpha \leq \sup _{h \leq f, \space h \space simple} \{ \int_A h d \mu \}$ and finally $\sup \{ \sum_{i=1}^N (\inf _{x_i \in E_i} f(x_i)) \mu(E_i) \} \leq  \sup _{h \leq f, h simple} \{ \int_A h d \mu \}$.

Setup: Let $E\rightarrow M$ be a Hermitian holomorphic bundle, $S\subset E$ be a holomorphic subbundle and $Q=E/S$ be the quotient bundle. Q can be seen in  unitary frames to be diffeomorphic to $S^{\perp}$. Hence $S$ and $Q$ are both Hermitian. Let $D_E$, $D_S$ and $D_Q$ be the connections compatible with the complex structures (Compatibility with the metric and vanishing on holomorphic sections). By uniqueness of such connections, $D_S=\pi_S\circ (D_E|_{A^0(S)})$ where $A^0(S)$ are sections of $S$. Now $A:=D_E|_{A^0(S)} -D_S$ is $C^\infty (M)$ linear and maps to sections in $S^{\perp}=Q$ with coefficients in $A^{(1,0)}(M)$ (Because of the definition of a connection and the compatibility conditions on $D_E$ and $D_S$).

Now, as in G-H, choosing a unitary frame ${e_i}$ for E (the first few vectors of which form a frame for $S$) we see that the matrix of forms for $D_E$ is $\theta_E = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_S & A^* \\ A & \theta_Q \end{bmatrix}$. Remark 1: The above formula is incorrect since in a unitary frame $\theta_E = -\theta_E^*$. So we should have a $-$ sign along with the $A^*$. Question 1: Is this correct? Assuming this, the correct formulas are: $\theta_E = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_S & -A^* \\ A & \theta_Q \end{bmatrix}$, $\Theta_S=\Theta_E|_{S}-A^*\wedge A$, $\Theta_Q=\Theta_E|_Q-A\wedge A^*$. These are derived from $\Theta = d\theta-\theta\wedge\theta$. Definition: G-H defines $\Theta$ to be positive if for all $v$ - holomorphic tangent vectors, the matrix $-i(\Theta(x);v,\bar v)$ is positive definite, in particular hermitian. Here, I assume we are fixing a local unitary frame, evaluating the coefficients of (1,1)-forms of $\Theta(x)$ on $(v,\bar v)$ and then looking at the resulting matrix in $Hom(E_x,E_x)$. Claim 1: is that $\Theta_Q \geq \Theta_E|_Q$, i.e. curvature increases in quotient bundles. Using the corrected formula, we want to show $-A\wedge A^*$ is positive. Note, a computation shows (by definition?) $-A\wedge A^*$ is in $A^{(1,1)}(Hom(Q_x,Q_x))$ and the $(p,q)$ entry is $-\sum_{\alpha,\beta} \sum_k a_{pk}^\alpha \bar{a}_{qk}^\beta dz_\alpha\wedge d\bar{z}_\beta$. And following G-H, contracting with $(\partial{z_\alpha},\partial{\bar z_\alpha})$ gives the matrix $-A^\alpha {A^*}^\alpha$ in $Hom(Q_x,Q_x)$ and they conclude that this proves positivity. Question 2: Since I am Un Idiota and the most I can do is follow instructions, I am assuming they are checking (as required by the definition) that $-i(-A^\alpha {A^*}^\alpha)$ is hermitian positive definite. But clearly the $i$ is spoiling things. Can I drop it from the definition? What am I missing? Positivity in other sources (e.g. https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/manuscripts/agbook.pdf defn 6.3 on page 338) have neither the $i$ nor the $-$ sign. But I need the $-$ sign so I can't drop both! Is there some standard viewpoint on the definition of positivity (Hopefully one that would fit consistently into this argument)? Question 3: Why is it sufficient to check the positivity condition on vector pairs of the form $(\partial z_k,\partial \bar z_k)$? If I try to contract with $(\sum_{l} c_l \partial z_l, \sum_k \bar c_k \partial \bar z_k)$, I get a matrix in $Hom(Q_x,Q_x)$ I get something far uglier which doesn't seem to be of the form $MM^*$ Thank you for reading.

1943243,"Why do we treat differentials as infinitesimals, even when it's not rigorous","From single-variable calculus where we first encounter differentials we are told fairly often that differentials are not to be treated as infinitesimal quantities/objects (but we are never really told why) , and we kind of hand-wave things and manipulate them as fractions (e.g $\frac{dy}{dx}$) in things like $u$-Substitution. $$\int f(x) \ dx$$ In the above integral, the differential, $dx$, seems to be doing absolutely nothing other than signifying where the expression for the integrand finishes. But the differential, seems to have more of a part to play in multivariable calculus. In multivariable calculus we often encounter integrals like $$\oint \vec{f(x)}\bullet\vec{dX} = \oint \|\vec{f(x)}\| \cdot \|\vec{dX}\| \cos(\theta)$$ where we can treat vector differentials as if they were infinitesimal vectors, and perform normal vector operations (such as taking the dot product) Questions and comments It doesn't seem all that clear to me why we can't treat either scalar or vector differentials as infinitesimals. Furthermore why do we even treat differentials as infinitesimals, even when it's not technically rigorous? I'm sure there must be conditions that need to be met that allow us to treat differentials as infinitesimals. It seems like in single-variable calculus the differentials we encountered just a special case of the differentials we encounter in multivariable calculus, which we can do more with. I've heard of integration on differential forms (which I'm about to start learning), and I'm assuming that all the differentials we've encountered thus far in single and multivariable calculus must be special cases of this general form .

$$\wp(z) = \frac{1}{z^2}+ {\sum\limits_{\omega\in\Gamma'}} \left (\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2}\right).$$ Fix $r>0$. For $\left|z\right| \leq r,$ we split the sum in two parts:
\begin{align}
\wp(z) = \frac{1}{z^2}+{\sum_{\substack{\omega\in\Gamma', \\ \left|\omega \right|\leq 2r}}} \left (\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2}\right) + {\sum_{\substack{\omega\in\Gamma', \\ \left|\omega \right|>2r}}} \left (\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2}\right).

Clearly $z=0$ is a pole of $\wp$. Also, the first part of the summation meromorphic function. Now we will show that the second part of the summation is bounded above and therefore cannot have any pole. Note that $$ \frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2} = \frac{z(2\omega - z)}{\omega^2 \left(z-w\right)^2}. $$
Assuming $\left|\omega\right| > 2\left|z\right|$,
$$\left| 2\omega - z \right| \leq \left| 2\omega \right| + \left| z \right| < \frac{5}{2}\left| \omega \right|,$$
$$ \left| z-\omega \right| \geq \left| \omega \right| - \left| z \right| > \frac{\left| \omega \right|}{2}.$$
This implies $$ \left| \dfrac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\dfrac{1}{\omega^2} \right| \leq \dfrac{\left| z \right| \times \dfrac{5}{2} \left| \omega \right|}{\left| \omega \right|^2 \times \dfrac{\left| \omega \right|^2}{4}} = \dfrac{10\left|z\right|}{\left|\omega\right|^3} \leq \dfrac{10r}{\left|\omega\right|^3}$$ We know that $\sum \frac{1}{\omega^3} < \infty$.

The reason I am trying to do this is because for a study I am doing I need a way of deforming the cube (onto itself) and be able to perfectly ""bring back"" the deformed domain to the original, in order to test some numerical algorithm I am working. Clarification just in case I have the XY problem . This is a follow up question from Example of a diffeomorphism on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ onto itself (or cube onto itself) . 
I am trying to make a real example out of it. I start from defining ""a smooth (at least continuously differentiable) vector field $V(x,y,z)$ on the cube $Q$, which vanishes on the boundary of the cube. If I don't understand wrong this is  a valid $V$:
\begin{align*}
V(x,y,z) = \bigl(
  &\sin(x \cdot \pi/L)\sin(y \cdot \pi/L)\sin(z \cdot \pi/L),\\
  &\sin(x \cdot \pi/L)\sin(y \cdot \pi/L)\sin(z \cdot \pi/L),\\
  &\sin(x \cdot \pi/L)\sin(y \cdot \pi/L)\sin(z \cdot \pi/L)\bigr),
\end{align*}
being $L$ the length of the cube. Then I solve the ODE 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} h(x,y,z,t)= V(x,y,z)
$$ 
with initial conditions  $h(x,y,z,0) = (x,y,z)$. If I am not wrong (I may be) the solution is:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}[h_x(x,y,z,t), h_y(x,y,z,t), h_z(x,y,z,t)] = [V_x, V_y, V_z].
$$ And by integrating the right hand side from $t=0$ to $t=t_0$ $dt$ I get:
$$
h_x(x,y,z,t) = x_0 + t\cdot\sin(x \cdot \pi/L)\sin(y \cdot \pi/L)\sin(z \cdot \pi/L)
$$
(same with the other two). This equation does indeed describe a map of the cube onto itself (automorphism?), that actually looks similar to the image in the original post (especially if you modify $L$ by e.g. $L/2$). However, I am supposed to find the inverse map if I find the solution to $h_x(x,y,z,-t)$, which, if I am not wrong, simply translates to 
$$
h_x(x,y,z,-t)=x_0 - t\cdot\sin(x \cdot \pi/L)\sin(y \cdot \pi/L)\sin(z \cdot \pi/L)
$$
in my case. However, when numerically testing this, if I ""warp"" a grid with the first map, and then use this last one on those ""warped"" points, I do not get the original grid. So questions: What is wrong with my maths? What did I miss? What is the solution for this map? Is there one? If this is a bad way of doing the thing, what should I do? How can I get a map of the cube onto itself that I can invert ""perfectly"" (meaning I don't want a numerical approximation)?

1943597,Showing that the exponential map is a smooth diffeomorphism,"I'm trying to show that the exponential map from the symmetric matrices to the positive definite symmetric matrices is a smooth diffeomorphism. To show that the map is smooth, I'm just relying on the fact that it's the sum of smooth maps. I'm trying to use the inverse function theorem to show that the differential of the exponential map at every $s \in S_n(\mathbb{R})$ is invertible, and therefore that the map has a smooth inverse at every $s \in S_n(\mathbb{R})$, and therefore, that its inverse is smooth globally. I'm not quite sure how to show this. One idea was to use: $$ de^{A} = d\sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p!}A^p = 0 $$
$$ \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} d(\frac{1}{p!}A^p) = 0$$ Because $A$ is a symmetric matrix, we can diagonalize.
$$ \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} d(\frac{1}{p!}qA^pq^{-1}) = 0 $$
Then the entries on the diagonal look like $D^p = qAqq^{-1}...qq^{-1}Aq^{-1}$ $$ \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} d(\frac{1}{p!}D^p) = 0 $$
Where $D_{ij} = 0 $ unless $i = j$, and $(\frac{1}{p!}D^p)_{ii} = \frac{1}{p!}(D_{ii})^p $. I'm not sure how best to show that the differential is injective though.","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'lie-algebras']"
1943604,Prove q-Vandermonde Identity using a lattice path counting argument,"I have this problem, from Aigner's A Course in Enumeration : Vandermonde's formula for the $q$-binomial coefficients is
      $${{n+m}\brack {p}}_{q} = \sum_{k=0}^p 
q^{(m-k)(p-k)}{{m}\brack {k}}_{q}{{n}\brack {p-k}}_{q}$$
      Prove this formula by a lattice path counting argument.
      (Hint: Count lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(p,m+n-p)$, and consider the intersection between such paths with the line $x+y=n$.) I've previously solved this for the standard Vandermonde identity (not the q-analog), but I'm having trouble generalizing this to the q-analog. I understand this proof , could I perhaps using a similar argument to prove this?","['combinatorics', 'q-analogs']"
1943620,Find a non-linear function that when composed with a distance function is also a distance function.,"Is there a non-linear function from $\mathbb{R}^+_0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+_0$ so that for each distance function $d$ (on any set), the composition $fâ¦d$ is also a distance function? I know that for $fâ¦d$ to be a distance function it must satisfy: Let $X$ be a set and let $d : X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+_0$. For $d$ to be a distance function it must satisfy the following conditions $\forall x, y, z \in X$ $d(x, y) \geq 0$ $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$ $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ I have tried using $f = \sqrt x$. I am sure my proof for the first 3 conditions is correct however i am not sure about condition 4. My Attempt: To prove: $\sqrt{d(x,z)} \leq \sqrt{d(x,y)} + \sqrt{d(y,z)}$. We already know that $d$ satisfies condition 4, so square rooting both side gives me $\sqrt{d(x,z)} \leq \sqrt{d(x,y) + d(y, z)}$. From the triangle inequality we know that $\sqrt{d(x,y)} + \sqrt{d(y,z)} \geq \sqrt{d(x,y) + d(y, z)}$ $\implies \sqrt{d(x,y)} + \sqrt{d(y,z)} \geq \sqrt{d(x,y) + d(y, z)} \geq \sqrt{d(x, z)}$.

1943637,Is there a definition of closed sets in terms of closed balls,"In my general topology lectures, closed sets are defined in terms of open sets but I wonder whether closed sets can be defined in terms of closed balls in metrisable topological spaces.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
1943663,Is $E[\frac{\alpha}{b+x}]$ decreasing in $\alpha$ when $x$ is Gamma distributed with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$,"My question is whether $E[\frac{\alpha}{b+x}]$ is decreasing in $\alpha$ when $x$ is Gamma distributed with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (under the shape/rate parameterization). It seems like it would hold intuitively, and numerically, but the actual derivative of the expectation is incredibly complicated, so I don't even know where to start.","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1943685,Reason(s) Why the Set of Odd Permutations is Not a Subgroup of $S_n$,"Today in class, the professor went over some reasons why the set of odd permutations is not a subgroup of $S_n$. There are a couple reasons that I don't understand; those are: 1) The product of two odd permutations is even, so the group is not closed. 2) It does not contain the identity element (id = even). These may be stupid questions, but why is the product of two odd permutations even? I thought odd * odd was always odd? Also, why is it that the identity element must be even?

I know it could be solved with resuide method, and I want to know if there are some real methods can sove it?
Meanwhile,I remember a similar integral:
$$\large{\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(x^2+1)(x^a+1)}\ dx=\frac{\pi}{4}}$$
And I want to know the following one:
$${\color{red}{\large{\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln x}{(x^2+1)(x^a+1)}\ dx = \huge{?}}}}$$

1943726,Evaluating a Rather Complicated Limit with a Simple Solution: $\lim_{x \to 0} {\cos(3x)-\cos(x) \over x^2}$,"SE, I've encountered an interesting question while practicing evaluation of limits. The following is the expression to be evaluated: $$\lim_{x \to 0} {\cos(3x)-\cos(x) \over x^2}$$ I've tried applying the double angle formula to $\cos(3x)$ by taking it as $\cos(2x+x)$ but the expression just gets messier as I go forward. I would thus greatly appreciate a push in the right direction! The given solution is ""$-4$""","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry', 'calculus', 'limits-without-lhopital']"
1943751,The law of a continuous stochastic process and its canonical realization,"Let $T>0$ $d\in\mathbb N$ $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ be a probability space $X:\Omega\times[0,T]\to\mathbb R^d$ be a continuous stochastic process on $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ and $$\tilde X:\Omega\to C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d)\;,\;\;\;\omega\mapsto X(\omega,\;\cdot\;)$$ We can Show that $\tilde X$ is a random variable on $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$, i.e. $\tilde X$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal A$-$\mathcal B(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d))$. Moreover, the distribution $\operatorname P_{\tilde X}$ of $\tilde X$ is called distribution of $X$. Now, let $$Y:C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d)\times[0,T]\to\mathbb R^d\;,\;\;\;(\omega,t)\mapsto\omega(t)\;.\tag 1$$ If we could show that $Y$ is a stochastic process on $\left(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d),\mathcal B(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d)),\operatorname P_{\tilde X}\right)$, then it would make sense to call $Y$ canonical realization of $X$. All we need to show is that $Y_t$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal B(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d))$-$\mathcal B(\mathbb R^d)$, for all $t\in[0,T]$, isn't it? However, in a book that I'm reading, the author writes that $Y$ is a stochastic process on $\left(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d),\mathcal B(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d)),\operatorname P_{\tilde X}\right)$, cause $(1)$ is (jointly) continuous and hence $Y$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal B(C^0([0,T],\mathbb R^d))\otimes\mathcal B([0,T])$-$\mathcal B(\mathbb R^d)$. The former measurability is often called product measurability . I don't see why we need it here. A stochastic process doesn't need to be product measurable. Moreover, I don't think that the stated argumentation is correct. As far as I know, the only sufficient condition of this kind is that if $Y$ is a stochastic process (i.e. each $Y_t$ is measurable) with one-side continuous paths, then $Y$ is product measurable. Is there anything I'm missing?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions']"
