2096771,Construction of Brownian Motion using Haar wavelets,"I want to construct brownian motion using Haar Wavelets where $\varphi_n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ is an orthonormal basis of $L^2[0,1]$. I take the inner product:
$$\langle f,g \rangle = \int_0^1 f(t)g(t)dt$$
Now I take
$$\Phi_n(t) = \int_0^t \varphi_n(s) ds$$
This is obviously well defined since $\varphi_n \in L^2[0,1] \subset L[0,1]$. Now I take a series of i.i.d. random normal variables $Z_n$ to create $$W_N^\varphi(t)= \sum_{n=1}^N Z_n \Phi_n(t)$$ I have shown that this is a martingale (w.r.t $\mathcal{F}_N$) for all $t \in [0,1]$. Furthermore I have shown (by the martingale convergence theorem) that 
$$W^\varphi(t)=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} W_N^\varphi(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty Z_n \Phi_n(t)$$ is well defined and Gaussian. I now want to show that this has independent increments and that for $0\leq s\leq t \leq 1$:
$$W^\varphi(t)-W^\varphi(s) \sim N(0,t-s)$$
Since $W^\varphi(t)$ is Gaussian, it is sufficient to show that the increments are uncorrelated, but I also don't know how to do that. Help would be greatly appreciated!","['stochastic-processes', 'wavelets', 'probability-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'brownian-motion']"
2096780,"How many way ,we can show $(e^x)'=e^x$","It is famous enough that $f(x)=\exp(x) \to f'(x)=f(x)$ . For example we can show it by taylor series like below :

2096841,What does it mean for an element of a group to be a function on the group?,"I am trying to learn group theory for my physics research. I'm working through these notes: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/ho/GNotes.pdf On page 3, the author states: ""It is straightforward to see that the set of all automorphisms of $G$ itself forms a group $\operatorname{Aut} G$ which must include $G/\mathcal{Z}(G)$ as a normal subgroup."" This confuses me; there seems to be a type error. An element of $\operatorname{Aut} G$ is a function $\phi: G \rightarrow G$. An element of $G/\mathcal{Z}(G)$ is an element of $G.$ So the latter group cannot be a subset of the former group, hence the author must be assuming some identification between group elements and functions on group elements. What identification is the author likely assuming? He references defining what he calls an ""inner automorphism"" by ""$\phi_g (g_i) = g g_i g^{-1},$"" and this seems like the identification I'm looking for, but I am uncomfortable with the fact that he's called this by the name ""inner automorphism.""","['group-theory', 'group-isomorphism']"

2096875,Intuition behind Transition Kernels (without use of Markov Chains),"I am studying Probability and a measure theory as a part of my masters course. I am very new to measure theory. I do understand the basic concepts  but the one topic I am really struggling with Transition Kernels. I am using the book ""Probability and Stochastics"" by Erhan Cinlar for reference. I do not quite understand the idea behind Transition Kernels. In all the research I did on my own led me to the topic of Markov Chains and as of now I have very little knowledge of Markov Chains. 
Is there an easier way to define them? The below definition given on the book, is a little abstruse and so I would like to gain some intuition about it. Given measure spaces (E, E ) and (F, F ) we define measure kernel K:E× F →[0,∞] such that: i)  x → K(x,B) is E measurable for every set B in F ii) B → K(x,B) is a measure on (F, F ) for every x in E Any help is much appreciated!

2096900,Alternative Slutsky's Theorem proof with conditional Expectation,"Prove the statement: $X_n \to X$ in distribution and $Y_n \to c$ in probability, then $Y_n X_n \to cX$ in distribution. Notice that $X_n Y_n = (Y_n - c)X_n + cX_n$. Now define 
$W_n = (Y_n - c)X_n$ and $Z_n =cX_n$. We have then $W_n + Z_n \to W+Z$
where $Z=cX$. We need to prove that $W_n\to 0$ Using characteristic functions ($f_{W_n}$), we need to prove that $f_{W_n}\to f_W$, where $f_w = E[e^{it0}]=e $ By the total expectation, $E[e^{it(Y_n - c)X_n}]=E[E[e^{it(Y_n - c)X_n}\mid X_n]]$
Given that for each $x_n$, the function $g(j)=e^{it(j-c)x_n}$ is continuous and bounded (assuming $|X_n|<\infty$), we get:
\begin{align}
E[g(Y_n)\mid X_n]\to E[g(Y)\mid X]=e\\
E[E[e^{it(Y_n - c)X_n}\mid X_n]]\to E[e]=e

In the filtration $\sigma(X)=\sigma(X_1,\dots,X_n,\dots,X_\infty)$ And the result follows. Im not sure if I can use the total expectation that way. I have the feeling that convergence $E[g(Y_n)\mid X_n]\to E[g(Y)\mid X]=e$ is ""pointwise"" for $x_n=X_n(\alpha)$, and I don't know if I can just assume that is known so I can use $g$ to prove convergence.

Please, comment if this lacks something. Thank you. Let $X\subseteq\Bbb K$ be perfect and $f\in C^n(X,\Bbb K)$ for some $n\in\Bbb N_{>0}$ .

The only way I can come up with is to count by hand (small sets in my case) but I was wondering if this is a known problem with a known solution. Another way to pose the problem is: Count the number of coverings of the set $B$ with exactly $N$ labeled subsets (where $N$ is the size of $A$), but I don't see that helping because then one has to start counting permutations and cases where two subsets are repeated, etc. It seems related to the set covering problem and maximum coverage problem, and I have read this question which is also related, but I thought maybe my version is a bit easier/more difficult? I just came up with a possibility for a recursion: $n_{A,B} = |A|^{2^{|B|}} - \sum_{S\subset B} n_{A,B/S}$. Does that sound right? Final edit: No it doesn't... I'm still repeating subsets everywhere.

The prime-counting function is given by the following formula giving primes in terms of $\rho$ (the notation $*$ means that at any point of discontinuity we take the average of the left and right limits ): $$\pi^*(x)=R(x)-\sum_\rho R(x^\rho)-\frac{1}{\ln{x}}+\frac{1}{\pi}\arctan{\frac{\pi}{\ln{x}}}$$ where $R(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n}\operatorname{li}(x^{\frac{1}{n}})$ where $\operatorname{li}(x)$ is the logarithmic integral . This is complicated, and the Mobius function $\mu(n)$ contains information about primes anyway. However we have an explicit formula for the alternative counting function $\psi^*(x)$ (counting logarithms of $p$ at prime powers): $$\psi^*(x)=x-\sum_\rho \frac{x^\rho}{\rho}-\ln{2\pi}-\frac{1}{2}\ln{\left(1-\frac{1}{x^2}\right)}$$ which is a simpler and more elegant expression for how $p$ depend on $\rho$. I always assumed this would have a companion formula giving a counting function for $\rho$ in terms of $p$, and wondered what it was. This formula is not an example since the RHS refers to $\zeta(s)$ and doesn't capture the Fourier-type duality between $p$ and $\rho$. However I recently came across a formula due to Guinand (paper here ; formula also mentioned here ) for the counting function $N(T)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\delta R}\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\;ds$ where $R=[-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon]\times[0,T]$ (i.e. $\left|\{\rho\;|\;\Im(\rho)\in[0,T]\}\right|$; see this ) assuming the Riemann hypothesis : $$N^*(T)=\frac{T}{2\pi}\ln{\frac{T}{2\pi}}-\frac{T}{2\pi}-{\frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left[\sum_{n=1}^N \Lambda(n)\frac{\sin{(T\ln{n})}}{\sqrt{n}\ln{n}}-\int_1^N \frac{\sin{(T\ln{t})}}{\sqrt{t}\ln{t}}\;dt-\frac{\sin{(T\ln{N})}}{\ln{N}}\left(\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\sqrt{n}}-2\sqrt{N}\right)\right]}+\frac{1}{2\pi}\left(\arg{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+iT\right)}-T\ln{T}+T\right)+\frac{1}{\pi}\arctan{2T}-\frac{1}{4\pi}\arctan{\sinh{\pi T}}$$ This is what I was looking for since it effectively gives $N(T)$ in terms of the primes. However it is very complicated, making me wonder if there is an alternative way to define a counting function on $\rho$ for which a more elegant expression in terms of $p$ holds.

2097088,Prove the supporting hyperplane theorem for convex sets in Euclidean spaces,"Let $A\subset \Bbb R^n$ be convex and $p\in\partial A\ne \varnothing$, prove that $\exists v\in\Bbb R^n$ such that 
$$v^T(x-p)\ge 0,\quad \forall x\in A.$$
Note that the separation may not be strict (say, if $A$ is itself a hyperplane etc). Since $\text{int}\, A$ and $p$ are disjoint and convex, there exists $v\in\Bbb R^n$ such that $v^T(x-p)>0,\,\forall x\in\text{int}\, A$. Now the major task is to pass this result to $A$ and $p$. Indeed I only need to show that each point in $A$ can be approximated by points in its interior. However this may not be true, since $A$ may have empty interior. Even if $A$ has nonempty interior, it's not immediately clear why points $A$ can be approximated by its interior points, though geometrically it seems obvious. So now there are two major problems: 1). When $A$ has empty interior, then $A$ must lie in a hyperplane. In other words, $A$ has affiné dimension less than $n$. (This would be clearly false in infinite dimensional spaces, say $A$ is the range of an injective compact operator. So I guess the finite dimensionality has a key role to play here.) 2). If $A$ has nonempty interior, then any point in $A$ can be approximated by points in its interior. Looking forward to any help. Cheers. EDIT Just a little caveat: you might be very tempted to use, perhaps implicitly, some ""advanced"" properties of convex sets like ""any convex set in $\Bbb R^n$ is the intersection of affine sets"".

2097429,Hoeffding's inequality and learning.,"I am studying the feasibility of learning  from the book Learning from Data . The author uses a bin analogy to discuss the feasibility of learning in a probabilistic sense. I have certain questions to ask. First, I will try to summarize what the author is trying to do: Consider a bin containing red and green marbles, possibly infinitely many. The proportion of the red and green marbles is such that if we pick a marble at random, the probability that it will be red is $\mu$. We assume that $\mu$ is unknown to us. We pick a random sample of $N$ independent marbles (with replacement). Let $X_i$ be the indicator for the $i$th marble in the sample to be red. i.e., $X_i=1$ if $i$th marble in the sample is red, $X_i=0$ otherwise. Define $\nu:=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$. By Hodeffing's inequality, $$\mathbb{P}(|\nu-\mu|>\varepsilon)\le 2\mathrm{e}^{-2\varepsilon ^2N}$$
In a learning problem, there is an unknown target function $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$ to be learned. The learning algorithm picks a hypothesis $g:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$ from a hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$. We can connect the bin problem to the learning problem as follows. Take a single hypotheis $h\in\mathcal{H}$ and compare it to $f$  on each point $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}$. If $h(\mathbf{x})=f(\mathbf{x})$, color the point $\mathbf{x}$ green, else color it red. The color each point gets is unknown to us, since $f$ is unknown.. However, if we pick $\mathbf{x}$ at random according to some probability distribution $P$ over $\mathcal{X}$, we know that $\mathbf{x}$ wil be red with some probability $\mu$. Regardless of the value of $\mu$, the space $\mathcal{X}$ bow behaves like a bin. The training examples play the role of a sample from a bin. If the inputs $\mathbf{x_1},\cdots,\mathbf{x_N}$ in the data set $\mathcal{D}$ are picked independently according to $P$, we will get a random sample of red and green points. Each point will be red with probability $\mu$.The color of points$\mathbf{x_1},\cdots,\mathbf{x_N}$ will be known to us since we know $f$ on the data set $\mathcal{D}$. We define $E_{in}(h)$ to be the fraction of $D$ where $f$ and $h$ disagree, also called in-sample error, and similarly out-of-sample error $E_{out}$. Thus $$E_{in}(h)=\dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N[[h(\mathbf{x_i})\neq f(\mathbf{x_i})]], E_{out}=\mathbb{P}(h(\mathbf{x})\neq f(\mathbf{x})) $$ Using the Hoeffding's inequality, we have $$\mathbb{P}(|E_{in}(h)-E_{out}(h)|>\varepsilon)\le 2\mathrm{e}^{-2\varepsilon ^2N}\cdots\cdots(1)$$. Let us consider an entire hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ instead of just one hypothesis $h$, and assume that $\mathcal{H}$ has finite number of hypothesis $\mathcal{H}=\{h_1,\cdots,h_m\}$. We can construct a bin equivalent in this case by having $M$ bins. Each bin still represents the input space $\mathcal{X}$ with the red marbles in the $m$th bin corresponding to the points $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}$ where $h(\mathbf{x})\neq f(\mathbf{x})$. The probability of red marbles in the $m$th bin is $E_{out}(h_m)$ and the fraction of red marbles in the $m$th sample is $E_{in}(h_m)$ for $m=1,2,\cdots,M$. Hoeffding's inequality applies to each bin seperately. The Hoeffding's inequality $(1)$ assumes that the hypothesis $h$ is fixed before you generate the data set, and the probability is with respect to random data sets $\mathcal{D}$. The learning algorithm picks a final hypothesis $g$ based on $\mathcal{D}$. i.e., after generating the data set. Thus we cannot plug in $g$ for $h$ in the Hoeffding's inequality. A way to get around this is to try to bound $\mathbb{P}(|E_{in}(h)-E_{out}(h)|>\varepsilon)$ in a way that does not depend on which $g$ the learning algorithm picks. $$\left(|E_{in}(g)-E_{out}(g)|>\varepsilon\right)\subseteq\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^M |E_{in}(h_i)-E_{out}(h_)|>\varepsilon\right)$$ and hence, 
$$\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(g)-E_{out}(g)|>\varepsilon\right)\le\sum_{i=1}^M\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(h_i)-E_{out}(h_i)|>\varepsilon\right)$$. Applying Hoeffding's inequality to $M$ terms one at a time, we get $$\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(g)-E_{out}(g)|>\varepsilon\right)\le 2M\mathrm{e}^{-2\varepsilon ^2N} $$ I have the following questions. Why does Hoeffding's inequality requires that $h$ is fixed before generating the data set $\mathcal{D}$ ? Is it because $X_i$s, the indicator of $i$th point in $\mathcal{D}$ being red, are no longer independent after generating the data set, which is an assumption required for Hoeffding's inequality? For instance, after generating $\mathcal{D}$, knowing $X_i$ for some $1\le i\le N$ would give information for other $X_j$. Is this correct ? In the last step,for each term in the summation $\sum_{i=1}^M\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(h_i)-E_{out}(h_i)|>\varepsilon\right)$, author states that Hoeffding's inequality applies to each bin separately and $\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(h_i)-E_{out}(h_i)|>\varepsilon\right)\le 2\mathrm{e}^{-2\varepsilon ^2N}$ for all $1\le i\le M$. How is this possible? According to the previous question, the hypothesis $h$ must be fixed before generating the data set, but in this case we have a single data set $\mathcal{D}$ and we are later considering the hypothesis $h_1,h_2,\cdots,h_m$. How is the application of Hoeffding's inequality to each term in summation justified since the data set  is generated before hand i.e., before choosing a hypothesis? If we could apply Hoeffding's to each term in the summation separately, why don't we say that $g$ is one of the hypothesis $h_1,h_2,\cdots,h_m$ and hence $\mathbb{P}\left(|E_{in}(g)-E_{out}(g)|>\varepsilon\right)\le 2\mathrm{e}^{-2\varepsilon ^2N}$? Is the probability distribution $P$ on $\mathcal{X}$ independent of the hypothesis $h$ i.e., is $P$ chosen without bothering about the color of points in $\mathcal{X}$, which in turn is dictated by $h$?","['machine-learning', 'statistics']"

$A:=X\cdot Y$ where $X:=\{\frac{3m}{m+1}:m\in\Bbb N\}$ and $Y=\{\frac{4-n}{5-2n}:n\in\Bbb N\}$
$X$ is strictly increasing(I proved it) so its first term is the infimum $$\Rightarrow \inf X=\frac{3}{2}$$
$$\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{3m}{m+1}=3=\sup X$$ $$\sup Y=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{4-n}{5-2n}=\frac{1}{2}$$
I think $\inf Y=-4$ but I'm not sure how to prove it. $Y$ is increasing for $n>2.5$ or $n<1.5$ $n_1=2, n_3=-4 \Rightarrow \inf Y=-4$ After that I use the fact that $$\inf (X\cdot Y)=\min\{\sup X\cdot \sup Y, \sup X\cdot \inf Y, \inf X\cdot\sup B, \inf X\cdot \inf B\}$$ and $$\sup (X\cdot Y)=\max\{\sup X\cdot \sup Y, \sup X\cdot \inf Y, \inf X\cdot\sup B, \inf X\cdot \inf B\}$$ And then I find $\inf B$ and $\sup B$ in a similar way, and in the end I use the fact that $$\sup(A+B)=\sup A+\sup B$$ and $$\inf(A+B)=\inf A+\inf B.$$ Is there a better or faster way to solve this problem? Is what I did above correct? Thanks!","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'supremum-and-infimum']"
2097510,Found an recursive identity (involving a continued fraction) for which some simplification is needed.,"This is my second question in this forum; as I previously explained it, I am a ""hobbyst"" mathematician and not a professional one; I apologize by advance if something is wrong in my question. I enjoy doing numerical computations on my leisure time, and at the end of year 2015, I was working on some personal routines related to the world of ISC . With the help of these pieces of code, I detected algorithmically several identities; one was already described here and solved (see this question regarding a continued fraction for tanh ). After having spent some time on another one a year ago, I would like to get some help for simplifying what I found. This new continued fraction is: $$
\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{
\left(n+1\right)\left(\left(k-1\right)x-n\right)k}{\left(n+1\right)\left(k+1\right)} \tag{1} \label{1}
$$ The previous notation is the one I use; I find it convenient and it can be found for instance in Continued Fractions with Applications by  Lorentzen & Waadeland, but I know that some people don't like it; it has to be read the following way:
$$
a_0 + \operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{a_n} = a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + \dotsb}}}
$$ I found many partial formulas, some of them being very nice, involving hypergeometric functions or the Lerch Phi function. But of course I was rather interested by a fully general identity. I finally found something but that would need to be simplified now and this is what I am asking here. I would be very happy to finally see a nice identity for this continued fraction. Maybe such an identity could be published somewhere (if it happens to be interesting) and I would happily leave it to anyone who would have taken some time on it. Is it true that:
  $$\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)=
    \frac{\Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\big((k-1)x\big)}{\Gamma\left(kx\right)}
\times\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)$$ where,
$$\mathcal{L}\left(k,x\right)=\frac{k^{kx}}{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}+\sum_{i=0}^\infty
\big(
\alpha\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i)
-
\beta\;\mathcal{K}(k, x+i+1)
\big)$$ and,
$$\alpha=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}\Gamma\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}{k^{ki}\,\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}\\
\beta=\frac{\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i+k}\Gamma\left(k\left(1+i+x\right)\right)}{k^{k\left(i+1\right)}\Gamma\left(1+i+x\right)\Gamma\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)+k\right)}$$ Since I work with empirical computations, I have to say that this formula is rather difficult to check because convergence is rather slow, but it is a result I managed to get by gathering various other materials. In case someone would wonder whether it is worth spending some time on it or not, I can provide some partial results like nice special values:
$$
    \mathcal{K}\left(2, 1/2\right)\;=\;\pi/2-2
    \mathrm{,}
    \qquad
    \mathcal{K}\left(4, 1/2\right)\;=\;4\pi\sqrt{3}/9-2
    \qquad\mathrm{etc.}
$$ The case $k$ being an integer When $k$ is an integer, $k\geq3$, the continued fraction follows a functional identity: $$
    \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)\;=\;
%    \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}} + \mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right)g_k\left(x\right)
    g_k\left(x\right) + \left(\displaystyle\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^k \displaystyle\frac{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}\Gamma{\left(k\left(x+1\right)\right)}}{\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+k\right)}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\mathcal{K}\left(k, x+1\right)
$$ where $g$ is a sequence of rational functions. Unfortunately I couldn't find a general form for it but I could easely compute about 30 of them with the help of numerical pieces of software. The best I could do here was to build a triangle of integer coefficients needed for building a given $g_k$ function. Let's call $m_{(a,b)}$ the coefficient in the $a^\textrm{th}$ row and $b^\textrm{th}$ column from the following triangle: $$
    \begin{array}{rrrr@{\qquad}l}
        -8&&&&\textrm{for $k=3$}\\
        -20&2&&&\textrm{for $k=4$}\\
        -40&12&-24&&\textrm{for $k=5$}\\
        -70&42&-202&624&\textrm{for $k=6$}\\
        \textrm{etc.}
    \end{array}
$$ (I can provide about 30 rows of these coefficients, see below ); then, $$
            g_k\left(x\right)\;=\;\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{k-2}\displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)}x
        \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}}{\left(x+1\right)k^i\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i\right)}}
$$ A direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$ involves the same rational function $g_k$: \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&
        \displaystyle\frac{ \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)} }{ \Gamma{\left(kx\right)} }\\[24pt]
        &&\times\quad\left(  \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}}
        +\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^\infty
    \displaystyle\frac{ \left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)i}
    \Gamma{\left(k\left(i+x\right)\right)}}{k^{ki}\Gamma{\left(1+i+x\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)\left(x+i\right)\right)}}g_k\left(x+i\right)
\right)
\end{array}
\label{directform}
\end{equation} The first formula I gave in my question was found by substituting $g$ from these last expressions. Of course, finding some formula for the $m$ coefficients would be nice, but I couldn't figure out any despite the time I spent on it. It looks also like the infinite sum above can be turned into a finite sum of $k-2$ hypergeometric functions as a direct formula for $\mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)$. The initial cases are the simplest, like for $k=3$: $$
\begin{array}{lcl}
    \displaystyle\mathcal{K}\left(3,x\right)&=&
\displaystyle\operatorname*{K}_{n=1}^{\infty}\displaystyle\frac{\left(n+1\right)\left(6x-3n\right)}{4n+4}\\
&=&
\cfrac{12x-6}{8+\cfrac{18x-18}{12+\cfrac{24x-36}{16+\cfrac{30x-60}{20+\ddots}}}}\\
&=&
\displaystyle\frac{27^x\, \Gamma\left(x+1\right)\Gamma\left(2x\right)}
  {4^x\, \Gamma\left(3x\right)}
  -
\displaystyle\frac{4\,\displaystyle{}_3F_2\left(1,x+\frac{1}{3},x+\frac{2}{3};\;x+\frac{1}{2},x+2;\;1\right)}{ 3\left(x+1\right) }
\end{array}
$$ The general case being: $$
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \mathcal{K}\left(k,x\right)&=&
        \displaystyle\frac{k^{kx} \Gamma{\left(x+1\right)}\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}  }{2\left(k-1\right)^{\left(k-1\right)x-1}\Gamma{\left(kx\right)}}\\[24pt]

\displaystyle\frac{m_{(k-2,i)} x

1,x+\frac{1}{k},x+\frac{2}{k},\dots,x+\frac{k-1}{k},x+1\\[4pt]
x+\frac{i}{k-1},  x+\frac{i+1}{k-1},   \dots,x+\frac{i+k-2}{k-1},x+2
\end{array}
  {1}
\right)
}
{k^i\left(x+1\right) \Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x+i \right)}/\Gamma{\left(\left(k-1\right)x\right)}      }
  \end{array}
$$ where obviously the $x+1$ term can always be cancelled (since one of the $x+(i+\dots)/(k-1)$ terms is always equal to $x+1$ leading to a ${}_{k}F_{k-1}$ function. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make some substitution between this last formula with $m$ coefficients and previous formulae above involving the $g$ function. The case $kx$ being an integer In order to study consecutive integer values of the~$kx$ product, I will now use another notation: $$
    \mathcal{K}'\left(k', x'\right)\;=\;\mathcal{K}\left(x', k'/x'\right)
$$ Starting from here, $k'$ is assumed to be an integer (according to the previous notation, it means that~$kx$ is an integer). New identities, involving different expressions can be found (leading to different kinds of special values when possible): $$
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \mathcal{K}'\left(k',x'\right)&=&
        h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -
           \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}
           \displaystyle\frac
           {k'\;\Phi\left(-(x'-1)^{-1}, 1, k'/x'\right)-x'+1}
           {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]
     &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -
           \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}
           \displaystyle\frac{
           \displaystyle\int_{t=0}^1
           \left(
             \displaystyle\frac{\left(1-t\right)\left(x'-1\right)}{x'-1+t}
     \right)^{k'/x'}\textrm{d}t}
           {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]
     &=& h_{k'}\left(x'\right) -
           \left(\displaystyle\frac{x'}{x'-1}\right)^{k'-1}
           \;
           \displaystyle\frac
           {
                   \displaystyle{}_{2}F_{1}\left(1,k'/x'\;; 1+k'/x'\;; \left(1-x'\right)^{-1}\right) x'
            -x' + 1   }
           {k'/x'\; \beta\left(k', -k'/x'\right)}\\[24pt]
    \end{array}
$$ where $h$ is (again) a sequence of rational functions. Let's call $m'$ the sequence of following polynomial functions (I computed about 20 of them): $$
    \begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}
        1,&\textrm{(for $k'=3$)}\\
        -6 + 4x,&\textrm{(for $k'=4$)}\\
        41 - 53x + 18x^2,&\textrm{(for $k'=5$)}\\
        -348 + 648x - 420x^2 + 96x^3,&\textrm{(for $k'=6$)}\\
        \textrm{etc.}
    \end{array}
$$ (I have about 20 rows like that, see below ); then, $$
    \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\qquad}l}
            h_1\left(x'\right)\;=\;-1&\textrm{if $k'=1$}\\[12pt]
            h_2\left(x'\right)\;=\;0&\textrm{if $k'=2$}\\[12pt]
            h_{k'}\left(x'\right)\;=\;
    \displaystyle\frac{ m'_{k'-2} \left(k'\left(x'-1\right)-x'\right)\left(x'-1\right) }{ \left(k'-1\right)!\left(x'-1\right)^{k'-1}  }
&\textrm{if $k'\geq3$}
\end{array}\right.
$$ Again, finding some formula for these $m'$ coefficients would lead to a beautiful formula for $\mathcal{K}$. Materials (data) Finding a formula for one of these two triangles would lead to a direct formula; I put my data below in case someone would have a glance at them. I used the Mathematica format but it is very easy to convert it to anything else. Two pieces of data are attaches: the triangle of $m$ coefficients; the triangle of $m'$ polynomials.

(4 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Before you read my text down below. I would want you to know that I am down below talking about education on all levels, but mostly on the levels that is below university level. But on university level, at least not in all parts of the world, non-standard analysis is not very widespread. Non-standard analysis gives a more in-depth explanation and rigorous ground for understanding limits. While limits most often is taught implicitly and gives an implicit understanding - which makes it a hard subject to understand, for many new to the concepts of limits - non-standard analysis is a lot better method to use instead of limits, as it gives an explicit understanding. I would really believe that at least some areas of non-standard analysis should be given more place in regular education; the standard part function is a perfect example. Non-standard analysis are also a good and firm ground to have if you want to learn limits. There exists an elementary book written on the subject, which unforunately did not make it all the way into our schools: https://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html . I think non-standard analysis to be a good thing to educate students in, at an early level, if you want to give them understanding about certain parts of math. But traditional methods are closely held to. Why are traditional methods so hard held to?

(a) Find the joint pdf of $\vec X$, (b) show that the LRT for $\theta = 0$ versus $\theta \neq 0$ is based on the test statistic $- \left( \sum_{i=2}^n  X_i X_{i-1} \right)^2 / \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} X_i^2$. This is an old exam problem I'm having lots of trouble with. Each $X_i$ has mean $0$, and $Cov(X_{t+k},X_t) = Cov(\theta X_{t+k-1} + \epsilon_{t+k-1}, X_t)= \cdots = \theta^{k} Cov(X_t,X_t)$. From here I just use:
\begin{align*}
X_t = \theta^{t-1} \epsilon_1 + \theta^{t-2} \epsilon_2 + \cdots + \epsilon_t \\
Cov(X_t,X_t) = E[X_t^2] = \sigma^2 \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} \theta^{2k} = \sigma^2 \frac{\theta^{2t}-1}{\theta-1}

Assuming that $u(r,t)=T(t)\Psi(r)$, we have $$\frac{\Psi(r)}{c^2}T''(t)=T(t)\nabla^2\Psi(r) \implies\frac{T''(t)}{c^2T(t)}=\frac{1}{\Psi(r)}\nabla^2\Psi(r)=-k^2$$ for some (possibly complex) constant $k$. The differential equation for $T(t)$ is easily solved, we have $$T(t) = Ae^{i\omega t}+Be^{-i\omega t}$$ for arbitrary values of $A,B$ and $\omega=ck$. The spatial equation can be rewritten as $$\left(\nabla^2+k^2\right)\Psi(r) = 0$$ Now, since $\Psi(r)$ only depends on the radial distance, we can plug in the Laplacian in spherical coordinates to obtain an ODE for $\Psi(r)$. $$
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{d}{dr}\Psi(r)\right)+k^2\Psi(r) = 0
$$ Calculating the derivatives and rearranging, we have $$r^2\Psi''(r)+2r\Psi'(r)+k^2r^2\Psi(r) = 0$$ Initially, I thought that this would require Bessel Functions, as it looks very similar to the Bessel Differential Equation. However, I was told that this can be solved using only elementary functions and I was given the hint to write $\Psi(r) = r^af(r)$ for some other function of $f(r)$ and an unknown power $a$. With this, we have the following expressions for the derivatives that appear in our ODE: \begin{align}
\Psi'(r) &=r^af'(r)+ar^{a-1}f(r)\\
\Psi''(r) &= r^af''(r)+2ar^{a-1}f'(r)+a(a-1)r^{a-2}f(r)
\end{align} Plugging this into our ODE becomes quite messy, but we have \begin{align}
r^{a+2}f''(r)+2ar^{a+1}f'(r)+a(a-1)r^af(r)+2r^{a+1}f'(r)+2ar^af(r)+k^2r^{a+2}f(r) = 0
\end{align} However, this is still a second order differential equation that seems much more complicated than the one we had before, so I'm not sure what this accomplished.

2097761,Integral polynomial interpolation and the Vandermonde matrix,"I'm thinking about the following problem: Given $n$ pairs of integers $(x_i, y_i)$, when is there a polynomial $f \in \Bbb Z[x]$ with $f(x_i) = y_i$ for each $i$? We can always do this with a rational polynomial, and the following procedure gives a way to determine if it is possible with integer polynomials or not: Suppose that such an $f = f_0$ exists. By vertical/horizontal shifts, we may assume that $(x_n, y_n) = (0,0)$. Then $f_0(0) = 0$ so $f_0 = xf_1$ for some $f_1 \in \Bbb Z[x]$ that must satisfy $f_1(x_i - x_n) = \frac{y_i-y_n}{x_i-x_n}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$. Now induct. All of the steps are reversible, so this shows that if such an integer polynomial exists, we can take it to be of degree $n-1$. Instead of prescribing the $y_i$ at the beginning, let's ask ``What $n$-tuples of integers are of the form $(f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_n))$ for some $f \in \Bbb Z[x]$ and some fixed $x_i$?"" Equivalently, what is the image of the natural map $\Bbb Z[x] \to \Bbb Z^n$ given by evaluation at those $n$ points? Since I'm really interested in the failure of this map to be surjective, the object I care about is the cokernel. To set some notation, if $S$ is a finite set of integers (let's say it's ordered) with $|S| = n$, let $V_S$ be the cokernel of the map $\Bbb Z[x] \to \Bbb Z^n$ given by evaluating at the elements of $S$. The observation above shows that WLOG we can replace $\Bbb Z[x]$ by the group $\Bbb Z[x]_n$ of polynomials of degree at most $n-1$, and the map $\Bbb Z[x]_n \to \Bbb Z^n$ is given by the Vandermonde matrix with parameters the elements of $S$. This immediately tells us that the size of $V_S$ is the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix. Also, the procedure above realizes $V_S$ as an extension
\begin{equation*}
0 \to V_{(S-a_n) \setminus \{0\}} \to V_S \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1} \Bbb Z/(a_i-a_n)\Bbb Z \to 0
\end{equation*}
which has been helpful for small $n$. Is anything else known about the structure of $V_S$, and in particular, the map $\Bbb Z^n \to V_S$? Maybe we can determine the corresponding element of an Ext group (coming from the above SES) in some inductive way? I'm also interested in multivariable polynomials, but the problem seems less tractable there.","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

For ${ \begin{bmatrix}{\frac {n}{7}} \end{bmatrix} }$ , the only thing I could infer was that if $n=7k+m $ , where $(k,m) \in N$ and $m < 7$ , ${ \begin{bmatrix}{\frac {n}{7}} \end{bmatrix} }$ would equal $k$ . How should I proceed? Can anyone help?","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2098471,Speed of curve on a sphere,"Consider a curve $\beta:I\subseteq R \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^3:s\mapsto\beta(s)$ parametrized by its arc length defined on a sphere with radius r. We define the curve $\alpha$ as:
$$\alpha (t)=\int_a^t \beta (s)\times\beta'(s)ds$$
Prove that $\alpha$ has velocity $r$ and torsion $-r^2$. I don't know how to begin? Normally, I can find the velocity very easily by calculating $\parallel \alpha' \parallel$. But I don't know how to proceed when dealing with an integral and a vector product in the parametrization of the curve?","['spheres', 'euclidean-geometry', 'curves', 'geometry']"
2098491,"Find all integers $x,y,z,t$ such that $x^y+y^z+z^t = x^{2005}$","First I tried taking logarithm on both sides, but that just made it messy. Next I tried putting $x=y=z=t=k(say)$. That made the problem : $k^k + k^k + k^k = k^{2005}$ $=>3k^k=k^{2005}$ $=>3 = k^{2005-k}$ How can I proceed? Even by taking every variable equal, I am not able to solve the problem. How to solve the problem without making unnecessay assumptions ?","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math']"
