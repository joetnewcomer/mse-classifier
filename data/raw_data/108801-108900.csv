1565487,Find all incongruent solutions of $x^8\equiv3\pmod{13}$.,"Find all incongruent solutions of $x^8\equiv3\pmod{13}$ . I know that $2$ is a primitive root of $13$ and that $2^4\equiv3\pmod{13}$ , so we want to solve $x^8\equiv2^4\pmod{13}$ . Now, $\gcd(8,\phi(13))=\gcd(8,12)=4$ divides the exponent of $2$ , which is $4$ , so $x^8\equiv3\pmod{13}$ has exactly $4$ incongruent solutions modulo $13$ . I was able to find on my calculator (using brute force) that these solutions are $4,6,7,$ and $9$ (i.e. $\pm4,\pm6$ ), but how would I go about finding them without using a calculator?","['number-theory', 'primitive-roots', 'prime-numbers', 'modular-arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1565494,Are these functions of bounded variations?,"Define $$f(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2\cos(1/x^2) & \text{ if } x\neq 0, x \in [-1,1] \\ 
 0& \text{ if } x= 0.
\end{cases}$$ and 
$$g(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2\cos(1/x) & \text{ if } x\neq 0, x \in [-1,1] \\ 
 0& \text{ if } x= 0.
\end{cases}$$
are $f$ and $g$ of bounded variation? Proof: First, we have that
$$TV(f) = TV(f_{[-1,0]}) + TV(f_{[0,1]}) \geq TV(f_{[0,1]}).$$
We claim that $f$ is not of bounded variation, for instance, consider the partition,
$$P_{2n} = \{ 0 < x_n < x_{n-1} < \cdots < x_1 < 1\},$$
where $x_n := 1/\sqrt{n\pi}$. Note that 
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{n\pi} & \text{ if $n$ is even} \\ 
 -\frac{1}{n\pi} & \text{ if $n$ is odd }.
\end{cases}$$
Therefore
$$|f(x_{2n}) - f(x_{2n+1}|  = |f(x_{2n+1}) - f(x_{2n}| = \frac{1}{2n\pi} + \frac{1}{2(n+1)\pi},$$
but $$
 TV(f) \geq TV(f_{[0,1]}) \geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f(x_{2k}) - f(x_{2k+1}| = \cdots\\ 
  \cdots= \frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1}) \geq\frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} = \infty,\\ $$
therefore $f$ is not of bounded variation. On the other hand, we claim that $g$ is of bounded variation, to see this we only need to prove that is Lipchitz. By usual differentiation, we have
$$g'(x) = 2x\cos(1/x) - \sin(1/x),$$
and 
$$g'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(h) - g(0)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} h\cos(1/h) = \cdots \\ \cdots = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(1/h)}{\frac{1}{h}} = \lim_{h \to \infty} \frac{\cos(h)}{h} = 0,$$
thus, the derivative exists for each $x \in [-1,1]$. Moreover, $g \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. To see this notice that
$$\lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 0}x^2\cos(1/x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\cos(x)}{x^2},$$
so that $g$ is continuous. Now,
$$|g'(x)| \leq |2x\cos(1/x)| + |\sin(1/x)| \leq |2x| + 1 \leq 3.$$ To prove that $g$ is Lipschitz, let $x < y$ in $[-1,1]$, then by the mean value theorem, there exists $\xi \in (x,y)$ such that 
$$|g(x) - g(y)| = |g(\xi)||x-y|,$$
but $|g'(x)| \leq 3$, therefore
$$|g(x) - g(y)| = 3|x-y|,$$
for each $x$ and $y$ in $[-1,1]$. Thus $g$ is $3-$Lipschitz and therefore of bounded variation. Is this solution correct. I receive a hint that $g$ is differentiable as the standard way, can someone provide a proof on why it is so.","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"
1565496,What is the geometric implication of subtracting two Matrices representing linear transformations?,"If we have two linear transformations denoted by matrices $A, B$ operating on an arbitrary vector $v \in \mathbb R^n$, then how does $Av$ and $Bv$ differ geometrically from $(A-B)v$ ?

1565528,Stuck on GEB chapter 9 - is b a MU number? is b a TNT number?,"I'm reading through Gödel, Escher, Bach , and I found myself stuck at chapter 9. I've been rereading through several times already, but I must be missing something. To clarify my background, I'm a computer scientist, not a mathematician. On page 273, D. R. Hofstadter states that Could it be, therefore, that the means with which to answer any
  question about any formal system lies within just a single formal
  system-TNT? It seems plausible. Take, for instance, this question: Is MU a theorem of the MIU-system? Finding the answer is equivalent to determining whether 30 is a MIU
  number or not. Because it is a statement of number theory, we should
  expect that, with some hard work, we could figure out how to translate
  the sentence ""30 is a MIU-number"" into TNT-notation, in somewhat the
  same way as we figured out how to translate other number-theoretical
  sentences into TNT-notation. I get it how the ""statement of number theory"" b is a power of 2 can be translated to TNT. I can imagine that the statement b is a power of 10 can be translated to TNT, even though it is very hard to do. I'm beginning to lose it with translating the original statement 30 is a MIU number to TNT. All right, still, maybe we can somehow translate the ideas from Mumon Shows Us How to Solve the MU-puzzle, p. 268 into TNT? Maybe.. but from the paragraph following this question it seems that Hofstadter takes the even more difficult road, first translating b is a MIU number into TNT, and then substituting b for SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS0! He states that the task of translating b is a MIU number into TNT is difficult, but how should I believe him that it is at all possible (other than having some smart guy invent the translation)? Is it somehow obvious, that even though the translation is difficult, it must exist? Hofstadter says that Because it is a statement of number theory, we should expect that, with some hard work, we could figure out how to translate the sentence ""30 is a MIU-number"" into TNT-notation . I must be missing something - I know that some number theory statements can be translated to TNT, but I'm not expecting that this particular one can be translated to TNT, and I'm not expecting at all that all number theory statements can be translated to TNT. I'm not even sure - is the b is a MIU number really a statement of number theory? On the next page, 274, Hofstadter states that ... This state of affairs comes about because of two facts: Fact 1. Statements such as ""MU is a theorem"" can be coded into number
  theory via Gödel’s isomorphism. Fact 2. Statements of number theory can be translated into TNT. It could be said that MUMON is, by Fact 1, a coded message, where the
  symbols of the code are, by Fact 2, just symbols of TNT. I'm not sure that I understand these facts correctly. For Fact 1, I imagine something like that: MU is a theorem translates into 30 is a MIU-number . Is this understanding correct? Fact 2 is the very one that isn't at all clear to me. Does that (amongst other things) mean, that all statements of the form b is a SOME_FORMAL_SYSTEM-number where SOME_FORMAL_SYSTEM = pq, MIU, TNT, whatever.. can be translated into TNT? These facts seem to be very important to the understanding of the chapter... Hofstadter uses these as a jumping board for turning the Gödelization onto TNT itself on p. 278 α is a TNT-number ...Now it occurs to us that this new number-theoretical! predicate is expressible by some string of TNT with one free variable, say a. Sorry, it does not at all occur to me. Being a TNT-number means being a number that is defined recursively from a set of highly complex arithmetic rules. I cannot even imagine the shape of the resulting TNT formula. Would the TNT form also use recursion in some way? Or is there some trick to ""unroll"" the recursion? I'm completely lost here. I feel that without answering these questions, I can not continue to what's next and at least pretend that I understand what's going on. I  feel kinda cheated - reading through 280 pages, and then get stuck on what was probably supposed to be the climax of the first part of the book, not being able to comprehend. Any help will be really appreciated. UPDATE 1 I'm slowly digging through Mauro ALLEGRANZA answer. Comment 1 seems to be easily understandable to me. Now I'm pondering Comment 2 and 3 . This is my current understanding of what's going on: Having the arithmetical question from Comment 1 is c a MIU-producible number? We can translate: this question (probably inseparably) along with a set of the arithmetic rules for generating MIU-producible numbers into a TNT predicate with one free variable. More light on the method is shed in Comment 3 , but basically it is just an immensely more complex variation of translating e. g. the arithmetic question is c an even number? into TNT ( ∃a:(SS0.a)=c ). After that, we'll substitute all the occurences of the free variable c in the TNT predicate by the numeral SSS...(30x)...0 and we'll obtain a TNT formula (no more free variables). This TNT formula is isomorphically tied with the original question is MU a theorem of the MIU-system? in the following way: If the formula is a TNT theorem (a simple example of such formula: (SSS0+0)=(0+SSS0)) , it means that 30 is a MIU-producible number, and therefore MU is a MIU theorem. If the TNT formula with prepended ~ is a theorem, it means that 30 is not a MIU-producible number, and therefore MU is not a MIU theorem Is the above correct? I hope so, so I can continue on my journey through the last comment and more GEB...","['number-theory', 'formal-languages', 'logic', 'peano-axioms']"

1565574,Image of a cube under the flow's action,"Let's consider a system of ODEs:
$$ \dot{x_{1}} = \sin{x_{2}}+x_{1}\\
 \dot{x_{2}} = \cos{x_{3}}-2x_{2}+x_{1}\\
\dot{x_{3}}=\arctan{x_{1}}-x_{2}+x_{3}$$ I would like to find an image of the unit cube under the phase flow of the system for the time $t=1$. While dealing with linear systems $\dot{x} = Ax$, $A \in Mat_{n \times n}{\mathbb{C}}$, it can be done directly -- by  finding out the general solution of a system $(x(t), y(t))^{T} = e^{tA} \cdot (x_{0}, y_{0})^{T}$ (here it's 2-dimensional case) and considering a phase curve, passing through the vertex of the cube, given in the form $(x(t), y(t))^{T} = e^{tA} \cdot (1, 0)^{T}$ (assume that $(1, 0)$ is a vertex of a cube). Putting $t=1$, we'll get the image of $(1, 0)$  under the flow of a system for the time $t=1$. By the linearity of a flow and convexity of  a cube , i.e. any $x \in I^{n}$ can be written as $x = \alpha_{1}x_{1} + \alpha_{2} x_{2} + \ldots + \alpha_{2^{n}} x_{2^{n}} = \sum_{n=0}^{2^{n}}{\alpha_{n}x_{n}}, \sum_{n=0}^{2^{n}}{\alpha_{n}}=1$, then $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{2^{n}}{\alpha_{n}f(x_{n})}$, so it's sufficient to find images of vertices. Well, but how to proceed in non-linear case. Surely, solving that system solves the exact problem, but can it be proceed in a relatively 'good' way? Actually, seems that it's possible to linearize the system, by  exchanging transcendental functions with their expansions in the neighborhood of current points but i'm not sure, whether it works, even if it does work -- it would be wonderful to find out a rigorous  justification.

1565651,On normalized error measures,"I have function values $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ that are approximated by data $y_1,\ldots,y_n$. I am looking for a measure that describes the error in the data $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ and I want the measure to take values between $0$ and $1$. I am familiar with the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or RMSD (D for deviation):
$$\mathrm{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{\left(f_i-y_i\right)^2}} $$
Since this not normalized, I started searching for a normalized version, on which Wikipedia says: Normalizing the RMSE facilitates the comparison between datasets or models with different scales. Though there is no consistent means of normalization in the literature, the range of the measured data defined as the maximum value minus the minimum value is a common choice:
  $$\mathrm{NRMSE}=\frac{\mathrm{RMSE}}{y_{\mathrm{max}}-y_{\mathrm{min}}}$$ Not that I consider Wikipedia a trustworthy source, but seems to me this isn't normalizing, since this could even blow up the error measure (if $y_{\mathrm{max}}-y_{\mathrm{min}}$ is small). Another approach would be to not consider the absolute error, but the error as a percentage. Something of the form
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{\left|\frac{f_i-y_i}{f_i}\right|}\ \ \ \mbox{ or } \ \ \ \frac{1}{n}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n{\left(\frac{f_i-y_i}{f_i}\right)^2}}.$$
But this again does not necessarily take values between $0$ and $1$. Now my question is: are there other (perhaps better) measures to describe a normalized error. In other words, given values $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ and approximations $y_1,\ldots,y_n$, is there a measure to describe the error in these approximations that always takes values between $0$ and $1$?","['statistics', 'data-analysis', 'mean-square-error']"

1565806,Finding an algorithm for the given problem,"Let's presume that we have a PVP fight scene, where 1 or 2 heroes, are fighting 3 monsters. The monsters that the heroes are fighting are the following: Skeleton (2 of this monster) Health: 1 Defense: 0 Attack: 1 Death Knight (1 of this monster) Health: 4 Defense: 1 Attack: 3 Whenever a hero attacks, the defense of the monster is reduced from the damage the hero deals. The heroes are the same, they can use one of two attacks, an attack, that deals 1 damage to every enemy, or an attack, that deals 3 damage to a single enemy. The objective of the heroes are to sustain as few damage as possible from the monsters. If a single hero faces this threat, the optimal move would be, to use it's mass attack, to kill the two Skeletons first with one shot, and then kill the Death Knight in the following two turns, this way sustaining a total damage of: (3)+(3)=6 . (if the single hero tries to kill the Death Knight first, he needs two turns to do so, so he will sustain (3+1+1)+(1+1)=7 damage But if two heroes are present, it would be more wiser for the heroes, to gang up on the Death Knight firstly, with two single attacks(which eliminate him), and then either clear out the skeletons with a single mass attack, or with two simple attacks. This way the total damage sustained would be (1+1)=2 . (if they clear the Skeletons with a single mass attack, and the other hero attacks the Death Knight , they would sustain a total of (3)=6 damage, as they would still need a second turn to kill the Death Knight.) NOTE: the parantheses are the damages sustained in a turn How could I find an algorithm, that would tell my heroes which attack is more cost-worthy for them to use?

EDIT 1: Based on this example, I could say that the correct move is always the one, which kills the most monsters in a single case, but this isn't correct, if we increase the Death Knights damage, so the correct move must have a score which is calculated using the monsters attack, and the number of monsters that can be killed in a single turn.

But this fact is almost always proven in texts using an integral, which ends up using the derivatives of $\sin$ and $\cos$, and we're back to that limit again.

Let's take $R=\Bbbk [x_1,\dots ,x_n]$ for $\Bbbk $ algebraically closed. If $I,J$ are radical, the standard dictionary tells us $R(I\cap J)$ is the coordinate ring of the variety $\mathbf V(I)\cup \mathbf V(J)$. Furthermore, if $I+J$ is radical then $R/(I+J)$ is the coordinate ring of the intersection $\mathbf V(I)\cap\mathbf V(J)$. Now the elements in the pullback are just pairs of functions which are consistent on the intersection, and the isomorphism tells us we can glue them to get a function defined on the union. This has a very sheafy feel to it, yet I find the need for $I,J$ to be radical somewhat disconcerting. I don't know any scheme theory, and I'm not sure exactly how to phrase my question except: What's the underlying sheaf here and in what context is it most

Upon this disc, $n$ pepperoni will be distributed completely randomly. All pepperoni have the same radius $r$. A pepperoni is ""free"" if it does not overlap any other pepperoni. You are free to choose $n$. Suppose you choose a small $n$. The chance that any given pepperoni is free are very large. But $n$ is small so the total number of free pepperoni is small. Suppose you choose a large $n$. The chance that any given pepperoni is free are small. But there are a lot of them. Clearly, for a given $R$ and $r$, there is some optimal $n$ that maximizes the expected number of free pepperoni. How to find this optimum? Edit: picking the answer So it looks like leonbloy's answer given the best approximation in the cases I've looked at: r/R          n* by simulation     n_free (sim)     (R/2r)^2

Here are a few pictures of a simulation for r/R = 0.1581, n=12: Edit after three answers posted: I wrote a little simulation. I'll paste the code below so it can be checked (edit: it's been fixed to correctly pick points randomly on a unit disc). I've looked at two three cases so far. First case, r = 0.1581, R = 1, which is roughly p = 0.1 by mzp's notation. At these parameters I got n* = 12 (free pepperoni = 4.52). Arthur's expression did not appear to be maximized here. leonbloy's answer would give 10. I also did r = 0.1, R = 1. I got n* = 29 (free pepperoni = 10.38) in this case.

Thus, for each $E$ there is a unique homotopy class $[f_E:X\to G_n(\mathbb{C}^\infty)]$ determined by $E$. This in turn induces a map on any contravariant functor $\mathcal{F}$ from the homotopy category to an algebraic category $$ \mathcal{F}([f_E]): \mathcal{F}(G_n(\mathbb{C}^\infty))\to \mathcal{F}(X) $$ Then $\mathcal{F}([f_E]) \neq \mathcal{F}([f_\tilde{E}])$ implies $E \ncong\tilde{E}$, because $E\cong\tilde{E}$ implies $[f_E]=[f_\tilde{E}]$. Question 1: Is there any functor $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathcal{F}([f_E]) = \mathcal{F}([f_\tilde{E}])$ implies $E\cong \tilde{E}$? (perhaps for sufficient conditions on $X$?)

But of interest to me is if there is a way to construct a countably additive probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{N}$ such that we can't extend $\mu$ to $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Apparently there's no way to do it when $\mu$ is defined on all singletons, as for any set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we have
\begin{align*}
\mu(S) & = \sum_{k \in S} \mu( \{k \}) \\
& = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \chi_{S} \mu( \{k\} )
\end{align*}
Clearly we have that $\mu(\mathbb{N}) = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \mu ( \{k\}) = 1$, so we know that $\lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{k = N + 1}^{\infty} \mu( \{ k \} ) = 0$. But then we use this to show that $\mu(S)$ is well-defined, as the sum converges. Let $\epsilon > 0$, and let $N$ be large enough that $\sum_{k = N + 1}^{\infty} \mu( \{k \}) < \epsilon$.
\begin{align*}
\left| \left( \sum_{k \in S} \mu( \{k\}) \right) - \left( \sum_{k = 1}^{N} \mu( \{ k \} ) \right) \right| & = \left| \sum_{k = N + 1}^{\infty} \chi_{S} \mu(\{k\}) \right| \\
& \leq \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \| \chi_{S} \mu(\{k\}) \| \\
& \leq \sum_{k = N + 1}^{\infty} \mu( \{k\} ) \\
& < \epsilon .
\end{align*}
So is there a way to define a measure on $\mathbb{N}$ that is finite, but cannot be extended to measure the singletons? Is it possible if we drop the assumption that $\mu$ be finite? Can we show instead that any countably additive measure will extend to all of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$?","['examples-counterexamples', 'measure-theory']"

1566547,Can we predict if we are going to get extraneous root(s)?,"We have extraneous roots when we perform operations on the given equation which are not invertible for all or some values of the variable in that equation. For example, if we have $x+2=0$, then, multiplying both sides by zero may give us $0=0$. It is not invertible since division by zero doesn't make sense. Solving an equation in one variable is the process of converting equations into equivalent equations and equivalent equations into equivalent equations and doing it so until the solution is obvious. Although the above equation $x+2=0$ can painlessly be converted into $x=-2$ and solution would be clear but ignoring it and multiplying it by $x$ would convert it into an equation which would be invertible and that equation is, $x^2+2x=0$ We get solutions $-2$ and $0$ but $0$ is an extraneous root as $2 \neq 0$. Of course, this is not the only related case but there may be infinite. In the case above, we multiplied by $x$ and this took us to an extraneous root. So it is clear that operations performed may lead us to extraneous root. My question is; are there signs which could tell us that performing this and that operation on an equation may leave us with extraneous root(s)?

By splitting $\mu$ in a real and imaginary part, and then using the Jordan-decomposition for signed measures. We can write $\mu=\mu_1^+-\mu_1^-+i\mu_2^+-i\mu_2^-$, where all four parts on the left side are finite meassures, and the two first are mutually singular, and the two last are mutually singular. I tried using the bootstrap argument. And I think I got it to work for characteristic functions, then simple functions, then positive funtions using the MCT, then real functions by splitting up in a positive or negative part. However the last step is where I am stuck, going from real to complex functions. What worked for real functions by splitting up in a positive or negative part does not seem to work for complex funtions. Because this was the step going from positive to real: $|\int f^+-f^- \, d\mu|\le|\int f^+\,d\mu|+|\int f^-\,d\nu|$, then using that it holds for positive functions I get $\le \int |f^+\,|d|\mu|+\int|f^-| \, d|\mu| = \int|f| \, d|\mu|$. But what made this work is the fact that: $|f^-|+|f^+|=|f|$, since if one of them is always zero for a given x. But for complex functions we don't have: $|\Re f|+|\Im f|=|f|$
So do you have any tips on how to finish the bootstrap-argument? PS: I do not know if there are many different ways to describe the integral of a function with respect to a complex measure, but my book defines it: $\int f \, d\mu=\int f \, d\mu_1^+-\int f \, d\mu_1^-+i\int f\,d\mu_2^+-i\int f\,d\mu_2^-$, and then if the function is complex valued you split it up in a complex and negative part etc., but this is no problem since the 4 measures on the RHS are finite positive measures, so it is treated in the ordinary measure theory.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

  $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$, never falling below the $x$-axis. Find the number of Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n+2,0)$ such that any
  maximal sequence of consecutive steps $(1,-1)$ ending on the $x$-axis
  has odd length. The above question is from Richard Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics. In fact, a solution is given by Stanley, but I am not sure why we should proceed like that. Let $A(x)=x+x^3+2x^4+6x^5+\cdots$ (respectively,
  $B(x)=x^2+x^3+3x^4+8x^5+\cdots$) be the generating function for Dyck
  paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n, 0)$ such that the path only touches the
  $x$-axis at the beginning and end, and the number of steps $(1,-1)$ at
  the end is odd (respectively, even). How do we obtain these two generating functions? Why does it suffice to consider the paths that touch the $x$-axis at the beginning and the end? Let $C(x)=1+x+2x^2+5x^3+\cdots$ be the generating function for all
  Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$. Note that the coefficients are
  Catalan numbers. It is easy to see that $A=x(1+CB)$ and $B=xCA$.
  Solving for $A$ gives $$A=\frac{x}{1-x^2C^2}.$$ Although I may not understand how to come up with $A$ and $B$, this part is simply computation. The generating function we want is $$\frac{1}{1-A}.$$ I again do not understand this part. Why do we have such a generating function? The above simplifies to $1+xC$, which means that the required number
  follows the Catalan numbers. Any help for the above question is appreciated.","['generating-functions', 'catalan-numbers', 'discrete-mathematics']"

small increments, but I'm afraid that this is not a general solution, as this will cause the geodesic to
""get stuck"" on parallels whenever the angle crosses zero. Use the relation that for a surface given by:
$$\left(\varphi(v)\cos u, \varphi(v)\sin u, \psi(v)\right)$$ The geodesics are given by: $$\frac{du}{dv}=\frac{\sqrt{\varphi'^2+\psi'^2}}{\varphi\sqrt{\varphi^2-c^2}}\ \longrightarrow\ u(v_1) = u_0 + \int_{v_0}^{v_1} \frac{\sqrt{\varphi'^2+\psi'^2}}{\varphi\sqrt{\varphi^2-c^2}} dv$$ This presents the problem of finding the correct value of $c$ given the starting angle, and as user levap pointed out, has the same ""getting stuck"" problem, since $u(v)$ is no longer a function.

But it turns out that for any $\phi$ you come up with, this defines conjugation in the group $ N \rtimes H$. I am having difficulty seeing why this is intuitively.
