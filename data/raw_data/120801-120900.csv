1808908,"Given $a_1,a_{100}, a_i=a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$, what's $a_1+a_2$?","I've been given the following puzzle Let $a_1, a_{100}$ be given real numbers. Let $a_i=a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$ for $2\leq i \leq 99$. Further suppose that the product of the first $50$ is $27$, and the product of all the $100$ numbers is also $27$. Find $a_1+a_2$. I tried the following, looking at the sequence for a moment we see:
$$
a_2=a_1\, a_3\\
a_3=a_2\,a_4\\
\vdots\\
a_{99}=a_{98}\,a_{100}
$$
So $$a_2=\frac 1 {a_{99}} \prod_i a_i =\frac {27}{a_{99}}$$ Looking at the other elements, we find that $$a_3=\frac {a_2} {a_1}, a_4=\frac {a_2}{a_1 a_2}, a_5=\frac {a_2}{a_1a_2a_3},\dots , a_n=\frac {a_2}{\prod_{i=1}^{n-2} a_i}$$ Then, $$27=\prod_i a_i=\prod_{1\leq i\leq 100} \frac {a_2}{\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}a_i}$$ The last product I believe is much more complicated than what I should have gotten... Has anyone ran into this puzzle before?","['recreational-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series']"
1808921,Infinite differentiability of a (cumulant generating) function,"Suppose that I have a moment generation function $M(t)$ that is positive and finite for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. I know that this implies that $M(\cdot)$ is infinitely differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$. Define $K(\cdot)=\log[M(\cdot)]$ to the the associated cumulant generating function. It seems ""clear"" that $K(\cdot)$ should also be infinitely differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ but how does one show it rigorously? More generally, suppose that $f$ is infinitely differentiable and $g=\varphi\circ f$. What properties about $\varphi$ must be true so that we can use such properties to show that $g$ is also infinitely differentiable?","['derivatives', 'probability-theory', 'calculus']"

I need a little help solving this problem. Now, I know how to find $A^n$ if this was matrix 2 by 2, or 3 by 3. 
I know there is a way to find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors and form the matrices $P$ (made of eigenvectors) and $D=diag(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ using $A^n$=$PD^n$$P^{-1}$ (correct me if I am wrong).
However, I do not know how to find the eigenvalues and eigen vectors. So, I tried this: My matrix $A$ would have this form:$$A=
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & a & a & \cdots &a \\

I was thinking about using $A^n\overrightarrow v=\lambda^n \overrightarrow v$, where $\overrightarrow v$ is my eigenvector, to get the result but I am really not sure how to go from here.

1808964,Lower bound on dimension of fibres of a dominant mophism of irreducible affine varieties,"Whilst doing exercise $11.4.B$ of Ravi Vakil's ""Foundations of Algebraic Geometry"", I got stuck with the following problem (although I think that many of the hypotheses are unnecessary and a more general statement can be proved by reducing to something like this case): Let $X=\rm{Spec}(A)$ and $Y=\rm{Spec}(B)$ be irreducible affine $k-$varieties of dimension $m,n$ respectively and $\pi:X\rightarrow Y$ be a dominant morphism. Then for any $q \in Y$, any irreducible component of the fibre $\pi^{-1}(q)$ has dimension at least $m-n$. I know that for irreducible varieties codimension is the difference of dimensions, and that for $p \in X$ with $\pi(p) = q$, $\rm{codim}_Xp\leq \rm{codim}_Yq + \rm{codim}_{\pi^{-1}(q)}p$. If we take $p$ corresponding to the generic point of an irreducible component of $\pi^{-1}(q)$ then, putting these together gives that $m-n \leq \rm{dim}\bar{\{p\}}-\rm{dim}\bar{\{q\}}$ where the closures are taken in $X$ and $Y$ respectively. I'm having trouble showing that the right hand side is a lower bound for the dimension of the closure of $p$ in $\pi^{-1}(q)$, which is the dimension of the irreducible component that we want a lower bound for. Algebraically this amounts to proving: given a prime $\mathfrak{q}$ of $B$ and a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ lying over $\mathfrak{q}$, there is a chain of primes going up from $\mathfrak{p}$ that all lie over $\mathfrak{q}$, of length at least $\rm{dim}(A/\mathfrak{p})-\rm{dim}(B/\mathfrak{q})$. This is easy to prove if $\mathfrak{q}$ is maximal (since then any maximal length chain of primes over $\mathfrak{p}$ will work), otherwise this difference just gives a lower bound for the number of times two consecutive primes in any maximal chain over $\mathfrak{p}$ pull back to the same prime in $B$. Edit: A more general inequality than the one I gave in the second paragraph gives that for any $p$ mapping to $q$, $m-n \leq \rm{dim}\bar{p}-\rm{dim}\bar{q}+\rm{codim}_{\pi^{-1}(q)}p$. In particular, as suggested by Hoot in the comments, given a particular irreducible component of the fibre, one can take $p$ to correspond to a closed point lying in that component and no other, so that it's codimension is the dimension of that component. It then remains to show that $\rm{dim}\bar{\{p\}}-\rm{dim}\bar{\{q\}} \leq 0$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'krull-dimension', 'commutative-algebra', 'dimension-theory-algebra']"
1808975,What is the probability of no pair's names being adjacent?,"Suppose there are $N$ (even number, positive) people. And each one person has to find one and only one partner to form a pair. There is also a roster within which everyone's name appearing in alphabetic order. For example, if $N=4$, fours guys with last name initials A, B, C, D, their names appear as 
\begin{array}{c}
\text{*** A***} \\
\text{*** B***} \\
\text{*** C***} \\
\text{*** D***} \\
\end{array} in the roster. Out of total number of pair-up schemes (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC) only (AC)(BD) is the nonconsecutive case of pairing up. So the probability in the case $N=4$ is 1/3. Numerically I tested $N = 4$ through 16 with a computer programme. Here is the results, \begin{array}{c|l|l|l}

1809004,Expected value of a geometric distribution with first step analysis.,"I am trying to understand the ""story proof"" found in this lecture . I am a bit confused as how the expected value of a random variable differs from the the random variable itself when considering indicator functions. Say there is a geometric distribution . $X$ counts the number of the failures before the first success, and $E(X)$ is the expected number of failures. Now I want to compute the expected value given $p$, the probability of success,  and $q$ otherwise. Let $c=E(X)$. Now I do first-step analysis,
$$c=0\cdot p+(1+c)q.$$ In this step, I don't understand the coefficient of $q$. In $(1+c)$, $1$ makes sense but why $c$? When computing the expected value: it is the $kp^kq^k$. So the coefficient $k$ is the value of the random variable. But in my example it is the expected value $c$ at the next step which confuses me.","['expectation', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"

1809088,A question on applying Residue Theorem to definite real integral,"I came across this question here and even though it was not my own question it intrigued me so much that I tried to solve it: Using the Residue Theorem find $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x \sin(x)}{x^2+a^2} dx$$ But I got stuck and questions came up. Here are my thoughts: First, I think the idea of applying the residue theorem would be to define a curve that is the boundary of one half of a disk centered at the origin. Then one computes the integral of $f$ around this half disk using the residue theorem. Finally, one uses this result by taking the limit of the radius towards infinity to find the integral in the question. Do I understand the idea of how to approach this problem correctly? Here is how I tried to implement this: First, we note that the poles are at $\pm ia$. So we want to choose the radius of the disk bigger than $a$. For example, $2a$ should do. Then the curves that together form the contour (CCW) are: $$ \gamma_1(t) = -2a + 2at, t \in [0,1]$$
and
$$ \gamma_2(t) = 2a e^{it}, t \in [0,\pi]$$ Then $$ \oint_C f(z) dz = 2 \pi i \text{Res}_f (ia) = 2 \pi i \lim_{z \to ia} (z - ia) \frac{z \sin(z)}{z^2+a^2} = 2 \pi i \lim_{z \to ia}  \frac{z \sin(z)}{(z+ia)} =  \pi i { \sin(ia) }$$ Then $$\begin{align} 
\int_{-2a}^{2a}f(z) dz &=  \oint_C f(z) dz - \oint_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz  \\
&=  \pi i { \sin(ia) } - \int_0^\pi {\gamma_2(t) \sin (\gamma_2(t)) \over \gamma_2^2(t) + a^2} 2ai e^{it} dt\\
&=\pi i { \sin(ia) } - \int_0^\pi {2a e^{it} \sin (2a e^{it}) \over 4a^2 e^{2it} + a^2} 2ai e^{it} dt\\
&=\pi i { \sin(ia) } - \int_0^\pi {2a e^{it} \sin (2a e^{it}) \over (2a e^{it} + ia)(2ae^{it} - ia)} 2ai e^{it} dt
\end{align}$$ And this is where I got stuck. I can't calculate $ \int_0^\pi {2a e^{it} \sin (2a e^{it}) \over (2a e^{it} + ia)(2ae^{it} - ia)} 2ai e^{it} dt$. This integral seems impossible to solve. Did I make a mistake in the approach? Or did I miscalculate somewhere?

1809181,$\sigma$-finite versus Locally Finite Measures,"Which implications are true (if any) for a measure $\mu$: $\sigma$- finite $\implies$ locally finite locally finite $\implies$ $\sigma$-finite My guess would be that both are false, but no counterexamples come to mind, since I am only used to working with $\sigma-$finite measure spaces, hence do not know many (if any) measures which do not satisfy that condition. I was thinking about this because I was wondering why local finiteness is used in the definition of Radon measures instead of $\sigma$-finiteness, and I figured that the counterexamples to the above question might give me my answer.

Show R intersection S is anti-symmetric. I started this proof by stating the definition of anti-symmetric with R which is 
$$ ∀a∀b(((a, b) ∈ R ∧ (b, a) ∈ R) → (a = b))$$  I know the basic idea that since R does not have any elements that make it not anti-symmetric, (i.e. for any $(a,b) ∈ R$ (b,a) is not an element of R), any set $R ∩ S$ will not include elements that would make R not anti-symmetric because elements of the intersections have to include both sets.  Because those same elements that would make R not antisymmetric any are not included in R, they would not be in $R ∩ S$.  Even if S was not antisymmetric and it had elements (a,b) and (b, a) where a does not equal b, and (a,b) is common with R, $R ∩ S$ would not have have (b,a) thus making it antisymmetric.

1809558,When is the compensated Poisson random measure a martingale ? (extensions to sets not bounded from 0),"Assume you have a Lévy process X. Let $N(t,A)$ be defined as the number of jumps in the interval $(0,t]$, such that the jumps size $\Delta X_s \in A$. It can be shown that if $0 \ne \bar{A}$, then $N(t,A)$  is a Poisson process with intensity $\nu(A)=E(N(1,A))$. Hence it is easy to see that for these A, we have that $\tilde{N}(t,A)=N(t,A)-t\nu(A)$ is a martingale. But I have a problem with $\tilde{N}(t,A)$ , when the closure of $A$ might contain $0$. Do we have that $\tilde{N}(t,A)$ is a martingale then, or may it be in some cases, and maybe not in other cases ? One of my problems is the extension of $\tilde{N}(t,A)$ when $A$ is not bounded from below, because then $N(t,A)$ and $\nu(A)$ may both be infinite ? In Protter's proof of the Lévy-Itô decomposition he ends up with the integral $\int_{|x|<1}x \tilde{N}(t,dx)$ as an $L^2$-limit of martingales of the form $\int_{\epsilon_n\le|x|<1}x \tilde{N}(t,dx)$. But has he then extended $\tilde{N}(t,A)$? I guess I am also wondering if $\tilde{N}(t,A)$ is always defined ? It is defined for sets $A$ with closure not containing 0, but is it also defined for all sets $A$, or can it be extended to give meaning for all sets $A$ ? This problem comes up when I want to do stochastic integration with respect to this measure, and integrate functions like $\int_0^T\int_Ef(t,x)(\omega)\tilde{N}(dt,dx)$. In order to do Itô-calculus we need that $\tilde{N}$ is a ""martingale-valued measure""(in the most general case we need it to be a semimartingale I guess(Protter), but a theory that I am reading only uses martingale valued measures).","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'levy-processes', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-calculus']"

Then, the question: is its null space the same as the null space of the hermitian operator $A^*A$ ? The operator  $A^*$ is its ""adjoint"", defined regarding the inner product on $H$: $\langle Au,v\rangle = \langle u,A^*v\rangle$ for every pair $u,v\in H$, and the null space of $A$ is the set of vectors $u$ in $H$ verifying $Au = 0$. I did not find a written proof, may be because it should be trivial.
 So, here are my arguments: if $u \neq 0$ and $Au = 0$, then  $A^*Au = 0$, and first inclusion between null spaces follows. Reverse, if   $A^*Au = 0$, then for every $v$, $\langle A^*Au,v\rangle = 0;$ or, $\langle Au,Av\rangle = 0$, that for $v=u$ becomes: $\Vert Au \Vert^{2} = 0$. It follows that $Au = 0$, proving the reverse inclusion between null subspaces of $A$ and $A^*A$. Am I right? If so, we could go further, proving in the same manner that the null space of $A$ is the same with the null space of $(A^*A)^{1/2}$.

It has been a while since I have dealt with delta functions (pun intended) and I'm a little uncomfortable with the last equality, $\int_{D(0,\epsilon)} \delta(x) dA= 1$. In particular I have a tendency to go back and forth between thinking of the delta function as a distribution or as a function. I'm fine with starting with the assumption $\int_{\mathcal{R}^2} \delta dA=1$ and thinking of it as a distribution. But my problem is that to me it only makes sense that $\int_{D(0,\epsilon)} \delta(x) dA= 1$ if I'm treating it as a function. In this case, then I would just argue that it is 0 outside of the disk so it's equal to the integral over all space. But treating it as a function isn't good since from measure theory the integral should be 0 then since it is only nonzero on a set of measure 0. So my question is, can you give an explanation for $\int_{D(0,\epsilon)} \delta(x)dA = 1$ that is grounded in distributions?

I'm pretty sure the standard sample variance $\frac{1}{N}\sum_i (y_i - \hat{\mu})^2$ is not the way to go about calculating the rolling variance. I'm doing this in excel, so I have an actual list of prices that I exponentially smoothed and would like to calculate a rolling variance for. From here we have that the basic form of exponential smoothing is
$$s_t = \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) s_{t-1} $$
Is there a way to manipulate the recurrence such that I can obtain the moving variance? Does anyone have any ideas? Could it be related to finding the variance of an AR(1) model? I think the answer is $EMSD_t = \alpha (s_t - x_t)^2+ (1-\alpha)s_{t-1}^2$.","['time-series', 'statistics', 'variance', 'average']"

1810374,How many 7-note musical scales are possible within the 12-note system?,"This combinatorial question has a musical motivation, which I provide below using as little musical jargon as I can. But first, I'll present a purely mathematical formulation for those not interested in the motivation: Define a signature as a 7-tuple over the set $\{1,2,3\}$ such that the sum of the elements in the tuple is $12$. Two signatures are said to be equivalent if they are either identical or there is a circular shift relation between them (i.e. one can be circularly shifted between 1 and 6 times to obtain the other). How many unique signatures are there? Most modern, Western music is based on the equal temperament system , which divides the octave logarithmically equally into 12 notes .
Let's refer to 2 adjacent notes from these 12 as being ""1 step"" apart, two notes with one skipped note in between them as being ""2 steps"" apart, and so on. The (arguably) most natural scale is the major scale, which uses 7 notes from these 12, and has the following signature : $$\text{major signature}=(2,2,1,2,2,2,1)$$ This means that we can construct a major scale as follows: given any note to start from, the second note is 2 steps away from first note, the third note is 1 step away from the 2nd note, and so on according to the above signature. Now this signature really has not just one, but seven scales embedded in it. This is because we can circularly shift the signature, effectively meaning that we are picking a different degree of the major scale to serve as our home note (these seven 'permutations' are called the modes of the signature). Thus, for example, $(1,2,2,2,1,2,2)$ is not a new signature, but just the major signature circularly shifted left twice (and is called the Phrygian mode). My question is: how many unique 7-note signatures are there under the restriction that any signature must not contain an interval greater than 3 steps (this is to respect the fact that any 7-note scale in common use uses only 1, 2 and 3 step intervals, to the best of my knowledge). Some signatures in common use are: $$\text{harmonic minor signature} = (2,1,2,2,1,3,1)$$
$$\text{melodic minor signature} = (2,1,2,2,2,2,1)$$
$$\text{harmonic major signature} = (2,2,1,2,1,3,1)$$ The number of possible 7-note scales within the 12-note system is simply given by multiplying the number of unique signatures by 7.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'combinations', 'music-theory']"

View $\mathscr{P}$ as a family of line bundles on $X^t$ parameterized by $X$. This gives a morphism $\kappa : X \to X^{tt}$ How exactly does $X$ parameterize the family of line bundles? Do we take $x \in X$ and consider $\mathscr{P} \mid _{\{x\} \times X^t}$? Another possible interpretation I have in mind, although less intuitive: $\text{Pic}_{X/k}$ is actually a functor. By shorthand notation, if it is representable, then the same notation is used to denote the group variety representing it. Making this explicit, we have that giving a morphism  $Y \to \text{Pic}_X$ the representing object is equivalent to giving an element of the $\text{Pic}_X (Y)$, where now it is being considered as a functor. The latter is essentially $\text{Pic}(X \times Y)$, the group of line bundles on $X \times Y$. So given a line bundle $L$ on $X \times Y$, there is a corresponding $Y \to \text{Pic}_{X/k}$. Do we then say that viewing $L$ as a family of line bundles on $X$ parameterized by $Y$ gives $Y \to \text{Pic}_{X/k}$? This seems the likely approach based on how the theory is set up. However, it is not conducive to computations that one would like to make, especially eventually showing that $\kappa$ is an isomorphism. See the following paragraph. Finally, is there a more explicit description of $\kappa$? Namely, either a description of what it does on points or perhaps a geometric intuition for it. An example I would like to compute is that $\kappa (0) = 0$, i.e. that it is a homomorphism.

1810560,Natural isomorphism are base independent isomorphisms?,"In Linear Algebra courses, often one hears the term ""natural isomorphism"" to designate isomorphism which behave like $V \cong V^{**}$ (in the finite dimensional case). Usually, one comes across the rather coarse definition: an isomorphism $\phi: V \to W$ between vector spaces is said to be natural (or canonical) when its expression does not depend on a particular choice of basis. It seems like a weird definition, to say the least, so it is tempting to look for a more rigorous one in a Category Theory book. Maclane, for example, defines firstly a natural transformation between two functors. After that, it is possible to show that if we consider the category $Vect_{K}$ of finite dimesional vector spaces, and the functors $Id, dDual: Vect_{K} \to Vect_{K}$, the first one being the identity functor, and the second one being the functor that takes vector spaces to their double dual, and linear transformations to their double dual tranformations, then we can find a natural transformation between them. 
The questions therefore are: Is it true that a (collecion of, maybe) basis independent isomomorphism(s) ""induces"" a functor $\tau$ on $Vect_{K}$ in such a manner that there exists a natural transformation between $\tau$ and $Id$? Given a natural transformation between a functor $\tau$ on $Vect_{K}$ and the identity functor, is it true that we can find a collection of basis independent isomorphism beween vector spaces?

Is there some better way to obtain this limit? It looks that if we can find a function $f(y)$ such that
$$f(y)\leq\frac{2y^3-3y^2}{{(1-y)}^2}\leq-3y^2$$

$$\lim_{\xi\to\infty}\xi\int_0^1\exp\left[\frac{\xi^2}{4}f(y)\right]\mathrm{d}y=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{3}}\,,$$

In other words, every open set in $X$ is the union of а subcollection of $\{V_{\alpha}\}$. Prove that every separable metric space has a countable base. Proof: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $D=\{d_j\}_{j\in \mathbb{N}}$ be the countable and dense subset of $X$. Let $U$ is an open set in $X$ then for $x\in U$ $\exists \varepsilon_x>0$ such that $N_{\varepsilon_x}(x)\subset U$. Then $\exists d_j\in D$ such that $d(x, d_j)<{\varepsilon_x}/{4}$ $\Rightarrow$ $d_j\in N_{{\varepsilon_x}/{4}}(x)\subset U$. It's easy to check that $N_{{\varepsilon_x}/{4}}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)$. Indeed, if $z\in N_{{\varepsilon_x}/{4}}(d_j)$ then $d(z,d_j)<\varepsilon_x/4$ and since $d(x, d_j)<{\varepsilon_x}/{4}$ then by triangle inequality: $$d(z,x)\leqslant d(z,d_j)+d(x, d_j)<{\varepsilon_x}/{4}+{\varepsilon_x}/{4}<{\varepsilon_x}.$$ 
Hence $z\in N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)$ and inclusion $N_{{\varepsilon_x}/{4}}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)$ holds. By the way $N_{r}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)\subset U$ for $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ and $r<{\varepsilon_x}/{4}$. Thus for every $x\in U$ we associate an open ball with center at some point $d_j$ of $D$ and rational radius $r$ such that $x\in N_{r}(d_j)\subset N_{{\varepsilon_x}}(x)\subset U$. Thus $$U=\bigcup\limits_{d_j\in U} N_{r_j}(d_j).$$ This set equality can be verified very easy. Inclusion $\subseteq$ I described in above paragraph. Converse inclusion is not difficult: if $z\in \bigcup\limits_{d_j\in U} N_{r_j}(d_j)$ then $z\in N_{r_j}(d_j)$ for some $d_j\in U$. But these balls 
arranged so that $N_{r_j}(d_j)\subset U$ then $z\in U$. Hence collection of balls $\{N_{r}(d): r\in \mathbb{Q}, d\in D\}$ is a countable base . Is my proof correct? Can anyone check it please?

1810786,Relation between tangent spaces of (un)stable manifolds in Morse theory,"After asking this question about signs in the Morse complex, I realised that my confusion is really about how tangent spaces to different (un)stable manifolds are related.  So suppose we have a Morse function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$, satisfying the Morse-Smale condition, with critical points at $x$ and $y$.  Letting $W^s$ and $W^u$ denote stable and unstable manifolds respectively, suppose $W^u(x) \cap W^s(y)$ is non-empty, and pick a component $\gamma$.  I would like to know the following: Can we make sense of the limit of $TW^u(x)$ and $T\gamma$ in $T_yM$? If so, is it true that $\lim_{p \rightarrow y} T_pW^u(x) = T_yW^u(y) \oplus \lim_{p \rightarrow y} T_p\gamma$? These seem intuitively plausible, and would resolve my sign confusion, so I would be very grateful of either a reference or an explanation of how this works (or not!).

1810967,Connected component of $0$: why is it an abelian variety?,"With ""Abelian variety"" I mean a integral scheme $X$, proper over an algebraically closed field (complete variety) with a group law $m: X\times X \rightarrow X$ such that $m$ and the inverse map are both morphisms of varieties. I'm trying to understand the proof of Proposition 10.1 here . This is the situation: We have an abelian variety $X$, an abelian subvariety $Y\subset X$ with inclusion map $i: Y\hookrightarrow X$, an ample line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$. Hence we have: \begin{equation*}
X \xrightarrow{\phi_{\mathcal{L}}} X^\vee\xrightarrow{i^\vee}Y^\vee
\end{equation*} and we let $Y'$ be the connected component of $\ker(i^\vee\circ\phi_{\mathcal{L}})=\phi_{\mathcal{L}}^{-1}(\ker i^\vee)$ passing through $0$. The claim now is that $Y'$ is an abelian variety. I'm trying to prove this and those are my thoughts: $Y'\subset \ker(i^\vee\circ\phi_{\mathcal{L}})\subset\ker(\phi_{\mathcal{L}})=K(\mathcal{L})$ connected component implies, by a general fact from topology, that $Y'\subset K(\mathcal{L})$ is closed. Also, $K(\mathcal{L})\subset X$ is closed so we have:\begin{equation*}
Y'\xrightarrow{closed\\ immersion}K(\mathcal{L})\xrightarrow{closed\\ immersion}X\xrightarrow{proper}Spec k.
\end{equation*} Where the last arrow is due to the fact that $X$ is complete. Now, closed immersions are proper and the compostitions of proper morphisms is still proper so $Y'$ is proper over $k$. Furthermore, the connected component of $0$ in a topological group is a closed normal subgroub. Hence $Y'\subset K(\mathcal{L})$ has the group structure. Right? But how can I prove that $Y'$ is integral? Thank you!","['abelian-varieties', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Prove that $f(x)$ does not has all rational roots. My attempt: Clearly, $f(x)$ will have either 0 or 2 or 4 rational roots. Let us assume all the four roots of the equation are rational and they be $p_1/q_1, p_2/q_2, p_3/q_3$ and $p_4/q_4$.
As the question suggests:
a is odd, 
d is odd,
b is even/odd,
c is even/odd,
but, atleast one of b or c must be even.
$(p_1/q_1)*(p_2/q_2)*(p_3/q_3)*(p_4/q_4)=d$ (odd integer)           --(1)
$(p_1/q_1)+(p_2/q_2)+(p_3/q_3)+(p_4/q_4)=-a$ (odd integer)          --(2)
if --(1) is true,
the denominator of a root must be contained in the numerator of the remaining roots. This means, these numerators cannot have denominators containing a factor of their numerator.
So, there will be atleast two denominators whose gcd will be 1.
Thus, we cannot find any four rational numbers which add to give an integer  because rational numbers only give an integer if their denominators have atleast one common factor.
So, the equation cannot have 4 rational roots.
Same can be explained for 2 rational roots. So, I just wanted to ask am I correct in my approach or am I making any mistake. Further, I am not able to understand why there is a distinction of ad and bc as odd and even??

I have the theorem that states that for every point $P$ on Jacobian and fixed canonical divisor $D_a$ on $C$ there is unique effective degree $2$ divisor $D$ such that $P=[D_a]-[D]$. 
So, I need to count the number of effective $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational divisors of degree $2$. My idea: So I have that divisor of degree $2$ has a form $D=P_1+P_2$  where these are $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on $C$ (have degree $1$) or it has a form $D=P+\sigma(P)$ where $P$ is point of degree $2$, ie. point that is not $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational but is $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational and $\sigma$ is element in $Gal(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_q)=\{\sigma, id\}$. Now, number of such divisors is equal to $\frac{\#C(\mathbb{F}_q)^2-\#C(F_q)}{2}+\#C(\mathbb{F}_q)+\frac{\#C(\mathbb{F}_{q^2})-\#C(\mathbb{F}_q)}{2}=\frac{1}{2}(\#C(\mathbb{F}_{q^2})+\#C(\mathbb{F}_{q})^2)$. Am I right? Now, I can show that since $D_a=(a,\sqrt{f(a)})+(a,-\sqrt{f(a)})$, for every other $b\in \mathbb{F}_q$ we have $[D_a]=[D_b]$ so I have to substract $(q-1)$.

1811268,Uniform Continuity,"This question has three parts. a) Difference between continuity and uniform continuity b) Geometrical meaning of uniform continuity c) Correct the example Definition of Continuity of a function in an interval $I$ is quite similar to uniform continuity. I know that continuity is a pointwise property of a function and that when a function is continuous in an interval it means that it is continuous in every point in that interval. It is also easy to unterstant what this geometrically means (i think). The first one is clearly a continuous function while the second one is not. The same logic applies to functions with more variables. However i don't understand what uniform continuity means geometrically and how do we show in which interval  a function is uniformly continuous. For Example: 
$$ f(x,y) = x^2 + xy $$ The definition of uniform continuity says: We have two points $P=(x,y)$ and $P_0 = (x_0,y_o) $ $$ \forall ε>0 \exists d>0 / \forall P,P_0 \in I (|x-x_0|<δ, |y-y_0| < δ \Rightarrow |f(P) - f(P_0)|<ε )$$ So we take $ |x-x_0|<δ $ and $ |y-y_0|<δ $ $$|x^2 +xy -x_0^2 -x_0y_0|= | (x-x_0)^2 + (x-x_0)(y-y_0) + (2x_0 + y_0)(x-x_0) + x_0(y-y_0)|<δ^2+δ^2+|2x_0+y_0|δ + |x_0| δ = 2δ^2 + (|2x_0 +y_0|+|x_0|)δ<2δ^2+(3|x_0|+|y_0|)δ $$ Now if we choose $δ<1$ $$|f(P)-f(P_0)|< (3|x_0|+|y_0|+2)δ=ε \Rightarrow δ=\frac{ε}{3|x_0|+|y_0|+2} $$ Now is the condition for the function to be uniformly continuous, δ to be positive? In this case 
$$ δ>0 \forall P_0 \in \mathbb R^2 $$
So the function is uniformly continuous in $ \mathbb R^2 $ . However i previously chose $ δ <1 $ so $|PP_0|<1 $. Doesn't that affect the outcome?","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'uniform-continuity']"
