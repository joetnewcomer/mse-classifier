1216430,Spivak - Chapter 7 Question 5 - Could f(x) be a function other than a constant function?,"I'm self studying, and I was wondering if there were anything else that could be said about the following: Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and that $f(x)$ is always rational. What can be said about $f$? I said that $f$ could be a constant function, where $f$ equals a rational number $c$. From this, I said that it is then bounded above and below, and achieves a maximum and minimum value. I was wondering if $f(x)$ could be a function that is not constant and is still continuous?",['calculus']

1216520,Extending a function on a submanifold to the ambient manifold & proof of a property of a vector field.,"$\newcommand{\wt}[1]{\widetilde{#1}}$ Hello, I just tried my hand at two exercises from John M Lee's book Riemannian Geometry and I would like to know whether my reasoning is sound or if I did something wrong. This is about exercise 2.3 (a) and (c) . Let $M^n\subset\widetilde{M}^m$ be an embedded submanifold. (a) If $f\in C^\infty(M)$ , show that $f$ can be extended to a smooth function on a neighborhood of $M$ in $\widetilde{M}$ . (c) Let $\widetilde{X}$ be a vector field on $\widetilde{M}$ , i.e. $\widetilde{X}\in\mathfrak{X}(\widetilde{M})$ . Show: $\widetilde{X}$ is tangent to $M$ $\iff$ If $f\in C^\infty(\widetilde{M})$ with $f_{|M}=0$ , then $(\wt{X}f)_{|M}=0$ Okay, so here's what I did for (a) . Choose open sets $\wt{U}_\alpha\subset\wt{M}$ s.t. $M\subseteq\bigcup_\alpha \wt{U}_\alpha$ and such that they imply slice coordinates  for the sets $U_\alpha=\wt{U}_\alpha\cap M$ , and both form open covers of $M$ . A note on the slice coordinates (abusing the notation a bit, but this is the way he does it in that particular book): If $\wt{U}_\alpha\leadsto x^1,...,x^m$ , then $U_\alpha\leadsto x^1,...,x^n$ . Define $\wt{f}_\alpha\in C^\infty(\wt{U}_\alpha)$ via $\wt{f}_\alpha(x^1,...,x^m)=f(x^1,...,x^n)$ . This definition is obviously independet of the last $m-n$ coordinates. Choose a partition of unity $p_\alpha$ subordinate to $\wt{U}_\alpha$ , and set $F=\sum_\alpha p_\alpha\wt{f}_\alpha$ . Then $F\in C^\infty\left(\bigcup_\alpha\wt{U}_\alpha\right)$ is an extension of $f$ in a neighborhood of $M$ . Now, for (c) : We again use the slice coordinates $x^i$ like above. Note first that if $f_{|M=0}$ , then $D f_{|\wt{U}_\alpha}=\partial_i f\mathrm{d}x^i_{|\wt{U}_\alpha}$ with $n<i\leq m$ , so let $f$ w.l.o.g. vanish on $M$ . $\wt{X}_{|M}$ is tangent to $M$ . $\iff$ In local coordinates of $\wt{U}_\alpha$ , $\wt{X}_{|\wt{U}_\alpha}={X^i\partial_i}_{|\wt{U}_\alpha}$ with $X^i(p)=0$ for all $p\in U_\alpha$ and $n<i\leq m$ . $\iff$ $\wt{X}f_{|\wt{U}_\alpha}=0$ , since-roughly spoken-there is no matching pair of indices in the $\partial_i$ and $\mathrm{d}x^j$ . But this holds for all $\wt{U}_\alpha$ , so for every point in $M$ . Personally, I can't think of any conflicts there, but that's why I'm asking here: I don't have too much experience. So - did I make a mistake somewhere, was I sloppy, etc? Thanks!","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds']"

1216541,Picking Unique Balls from a Bin,"Problem: We have a bin with 5 red balls, 7 green balls, and 9 blue balls. We
  draw 3 balls out of the bin, without replacement. What is the probability that no two of the three balls have the same color? My Answer: Note that the probability of no two balls having the same color is equivalent to all three balls having different colors. The probability of this event is
$$\frac{5}{21} \cdot \frac{7}{20} \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac {3}{76}$$
Because on the first  step we want to pick a red ball, which has probability of $\frac 5{21}$, on the second step we want to pick a green ball, and on the third step we want to pick a blue ball. The order in which we pick the balls doesn't matter, which is reflected in the (associative) multiplication: $5/21 \cdot 7/20 = 7/21 \cdot 5/20$, etc. Is this right? I'm sceptical of my answer. I wrote a script to test my answer, and it appears that the probability should be just a little under $\frac 1 4$, which sounds much more reasonable.","['solution-verification', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1216644,Understanding higher dimensional derivatives,"I'm having trouble understanding higher dimensional derivatives. Suppose $f: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R$.  We say $f$ is differentiable at $x = c$ if $\lim \limits_{x \to c} \dfrac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c}$ exists.  If the limit exists, we define $f'(c)$ as the value limit.  Since this limit is a number, we can equivalently define the derivative of $f(x)$ at $c$ as the number $q$ such that $\lim \limits_{x \to c} \dfrac{f(x) - f(c) - q(x - c)}{x - c} = 0$.  If such a $q$ exists, we define $f'(c)$ to be this $q$.  We can think of $q$ as a ""linear transformation"" from $\Bbb R \to \Bbb R$. Why is it useful to think of $q$ in this way?  What's the point of thinking about it as a linear transformation? I think it probably has something to do with the fact that $f(c) + q(x - c)$ is the tangent line . Now, we can define the derivative of $g: \Bbb R^{n} \to \Bbb R^{m}$ in the same way, that is, if there is some linear transformation $T_{g}$ such that $\lim \limits_{x \to c} \dfrac{||g(x) - g(c) - T_{g}(x - c) ||}{||x - c||} = 0$, then we say $T_{g}$ is the derivative of $g$. Again, what's the point of saying this is a linear transformation?

1216801,Continuous function with finitely many discontinuities is Riemann Integral,"After a lecture today, I just wanted to confirm that I understand the proof of the following: If $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$  is bounded and continuous and has finitely many discontinuities, $f \in \mathscr{R}$. Proof: Let $\{x_1,\ldots x_l\}$ be the set of discontinuities of $f$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Let $M$ be such that $|f| \leq M$. Let $\delta > 0$ be such that $2(k+2)M\delta < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Now, consider the interval $$B= [a,b] \setminus \left( (x_1-\delta, x_1 + \delta) \cup (x_2-\delta, x_2+\delta) \cup \cdots \cup (x_k-\delta, x_k+\delta) \right),$$ clearly $B$ is compact by Heine-Borel. Thus, $f|B :B \to \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous. Thus, there exists $\delta > 0$ so that, if $|x-y| < \delta$, $|f(x) - f(y)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)}$. Now, let $n$ be a positive integer such that $\frac{b-a}{n} < \delta$. Consider the partition
$$P:= \left\{a=x_0, a+\frac{x_1-\delta-a}{n}, a+2\frac{x_1-\delta}{n}, \ldots x_1- \delta, x_1+\delta, \ldots, x_k+\delta , x_k+\delta+\frac{b-(x_k+\delta)}{n},  \ldots, b \right\}$$ That is, we have two types of intervals. One type is of the form $[x_i - \delta, x_i+\delta]$ while we chop what is between $x_i+\delta$ and $x_{i+1} - \delta$ into $n$ parts. Now here's where I get a bit confused. I suppose we chop this middle piece up even further, although I'm not sure why. Consider the intervals $$D_i = \left[x_i+\delta+m\left(\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i -2\delta}{n}\right), x_i+\delta+(m+1)\left(\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i -2\delta}{n}\right)\right]$$ Call $\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i -2\delta}{n} =T$. Then, if $y_1,y_2 \in D_k$, then $$|y_1-y_2| \leq T \leq \frac{b-a}{n} < \delta$$. so that if $y_1,y_2 \in D_i$, the uniform continuity condition holds. Now, for any $y \in D_i$, $f(y) = f(y) - f(y_1) + f(y_1)$ so that $f(y) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)} + f(y_1)$ for all $y \in D_i$. Thus, $$\sup_{x \in D_i} f(x) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)} + f(y_1)$$ and $$\inf_{x \in D_k} f(x) \geq -\frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)} + f(y_1)$$. Thus, $$\sup_{x \in D_i} f(x)- \inf_{x \in D_k}  f(x) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{(b-a)}.$$ Now, we need show that $U(f,P) - L(f,P) < \epsilon$. Let $M_i = \sup_{x \in \Delta_i} f(x)$ and $m_i$ similarly. We have that $$ \begin{align}
U(f,P) - L(f,P) &= \sum_{P} (M_i-m_i)\Delta_i \\
&= \sum_{[x_i-\delta,x_i+\delta]} (M_i-m_i)\Delta_i + \sum_{D_i} (M_i-m_i)\Delta_i \\&\leq
\sum_{[x_i-\delta,x_i+\delta]} 4M\delta + \sum_{D_i} \frac{\epsilon}{(b-a)}\frac{b-a}{n} \\&= 
4Mk\delta + (k+1)n\frac{\epsilon}{n} \\&<  \epsilon
\end{align}$$ Thus, $f \in \mathscr{R}$. Now, this proof seems a bit mathemagical to me. I understand that it works, just not why . I see that we construct little intervals around the discontinuities in order to ""ignore"" them, but I don't see, for example, why we need to create the $D_i$ intervals. Why do we need to chop the interval between the $x_i+\delta$ and $x_{i+1} -\delta$ into $n$ pieces. Why can't we just consider the middle and only the middle? Any insight to the intuition would be greatly appreciated.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'proof-writing']"

1216827,Show that every group G with |G|<6 is abelian.,"Show that every group G with |G|<6 is abelian. So I tried to prove this one by cases. Case 1: Suppose |G| = 1, then G is the trivial group, and is abelian. Case 2: |G| is prime, then |G| = 2, 3, or 5. Every group of order p, where p is prime is cyclic. Let g be a generator of any cyclic group G and let $a,b\in G$. Then, $\exists x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a=g^x$ and $b=g^y$. Then we have that $$ab = g^x g^y = g^{x+y} = g^{y+x} = g^y g^x = ba$$
Hence, all cyclic groups are abelian. Case 3: |G| = 4 This one was kind of hard to wrap my head around until my professor told me that only two groups have order 4, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{V}$, the Klein group. So my proof of this case was sort of brute force, showing that each group was abelian. What if I was asked to prove that all groups of order less than 100 ( Note that I understand this is not true )? Brute force would not be the most efficient, as there are many groups of order less than 100. Is there a more efficient way of proving case 3?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

This question asks about constructing a loop $(L, \ast)$ on a set $L$ of five elements (denote $L = \{1, a, b, c, d\}$ ) that satisfies the involution condition $x^2 = 1$ for all $x \in L$ . My answer there shows that there is only one such loop up to isomorphism; its multiplication table is: $$
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
\ast & 1 & a & b & c & d \\
\hline
   1 & 1 & a & b & c & d \\
   a & a & 1 & c & d & b \\
   b & b & d & 1 & a & c \\
   c & c & b & d & 1 & a \\
   d & d & c & a & b & 1
\end{array}.$$ This operation is nonassociative, as $(ab)d = a \neq ac = a(bd)$ , but the fact that every element squares to $1$ implies that it is power-associative; in fact it turns out to be flexible. Even without the involution condition, this example is minimal in the sense that any loop of order $< 5$ is in fact a group. Up to isomorphism there are $6$ loops of order $5$ : This loop, the group $C_5$ , and $4$ other non-groups (the other $4$ are not even power-associative). So, given that this example is both minimal and unique, it's natural to ask: Is there a more informative/interesting way to view the loop structure $\ast$ on $L$ than via its multiplication table? That is, does it arise naturally in some other setting?","['abstract-algebra', 'quasigroups']"

$$\langle M \rangle_n := \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{E}\bigl[(M_i - M_{i-1})^2|\mathcal{F}_{i-1}\bigr]$$ Ok, I tried the following: Let $Y_n$ be independent random variables, defined the following way:
$$\mathbf{P}[Y_n = n] = \mathbf{P}[Y_n = -n] = \frac{1}{2n^3}, \quad \mathbf{P}[Y_n = 0] = 1 - \frac{1}{n^3}\, .$$ Obviously $\mathbf{E}[Y_n] = 0$ and $\mathbf{Var}[Y_n] < \infty$. We define $M_n := \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ adapted to $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(Y_1, \ldots, Y_n)$, this is a martingale, because $$\mathbf{E}[M_t|\mathcal{F}_s]=\mathbf{E}\Biggl[\sum_{i=1}^t Y_i\Bigg\vert\mathcal{F}_s\Biggr] = \sum_{i=1}^t\mathbf{E}[Y_i |\mathcal{F}_s] = \sum_{i=s+1}^t\mathbf{E}[Y_i] + \sum_{i=1}^s Y_i = M_s \quad \text{ for } t> s\, ,$$
and because $\mathbf{Var}[M_n] = \mathbf{Var}[Y_1] + \cdots + \mathbf{Var}[Y_n]$ it has finite variance for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
By the Borel-Cantelli lemma:
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{P}[Y_n \neq 0] = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} < \infty $$ we see that $\mathbf{P}\bigl[Y_n \neq 0 \text{ i. o.}\bigr] = 0$, so $M_n$ converges almost surely. Similarly $\mathbf{P}[M_\infty = +\infty] < \mathbf{P}\bigl[Y_n = +1 \text{ i. o.}\bigr] = 0$, same for ""$-\infty$"", so $M_\infty$ is finite real valued. $\langle M \rangle_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{E}\bigl[(M_i - M_{i-1})^2|\mathcal{F}_{i-1}\bigr] = \sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf{E}\bigl[Y_i^2|\mathcal{F}_{i-1}\bigr] = \sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf{E}\bigl[Y_i^2\bigr]  = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i}\, . $ So we see that $\langle M \rangle_n \rightarrow \infty$ almost surely. $\square$ Is my example correct?

1217089,Small confusion about convergence test,"I have to proof that $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5}{10+n}$ either converges or diverges. The first thing that I noticed is that it looks like the divergent harmonic series. First I did the nth term divergence test, which turned out to be inconclusive. Then, because of the aforementioned harmonic series, I thought I'd do a comparison test. If $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} \leq \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5}{10+n}$, and we know the harmonic series diverges, well then $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5}{10+n}$ diverges. Now, here's the thing: I could write $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5}{10+n}$ as $5\cdot\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{10+n}$, but $\frac{1}{n} \nleq \frac{1}{10+n}$.

Here's what I don't know what to do:In all the examples I've seen, $n$ is always $\geq 1$, and there is no mention if it matters if you start your $n$ from somewhere else. Second thing is, it is easy to see that $\frac{1}{n} \nleq \frac{1}{10+n}$, since a bigger denominator means a smaller number. However, with $\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{5}{10+n}$ it isn't that easy to see. How could I proof it is so, from $n \geq 3$?

More precisely: So far as I understand, the topology on the space $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of test functions is usually constructed as follows: For each compact $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ we define the ""smooth topology"" on $C_c^\infty(K)$ to be the topology generated by the family of seminorms $\{\|\cdot\|_{C^k(K)}\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $\|\cdot\|_{C^k(\mathbb{R}^d)}$ is defined by $$
\| f \|_{C^k(K)} = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left\{ \sum_{j=0}^k \left|\nabla^j f(x)\right| \right\}
$$ We then define a seminorm $\| \cdot \|$ on $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to be ""good"" if, for each compact $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, it is continuous function on $C_c^\infty(K)$ with respect to the smooth topology. Finally, we topologise $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by giving it the initial topology induced by the family $\mathscr{G}$ of all good seminorms. (The construction above is the one given by Prof. Tao here on his blog. Any mistakes made in the reproduction above are mine.) What I would like to know is: How is the topology induced by the ""good"" seminorms different from the one induced by the family $\mathscr{F} = \left\{ \|\cdot\|_{C_c^k(\mathbb{R}^d)} \right\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$. I believe we have the inclusion $\mathscr{F} \subset \mathscr{G}$, and I can't really tell what we gain by considering the other good seminorms. In fact, I'm not really sure what the other good seminorms look like. It appears we can obtain some other good seminorms by considering functionals of the form $$ 
\eta(f) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} |f(x)g(x)| ~dm(x)

$$\text{Corr}\big(\frac{X_j}{\sum_i{X_i}},\frac{X_k}{\sum_i{X_i}} \big)$$
If the variates are 'iid' this problem is likely simplified considerably. And while I would like to see something of that form, the case I'm most interested in is when $X_i$ are all from the same 'family' of distribution, but with different parameters, $\mu_i$ as a varying mean, for example. I attempted looking at the fact that
$$\frac{X_j}{\sum_i{X_i}} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i\neq j}X_i}{\sum_i{X_i}} = 1 - \frac{X_k}{\sum_i X_i} - \frac{\sum_{i\notin\{j,k\}}X_i}{\sum_i X_i}, \ k\neq j$$
But using this just gives us
$$\text{Corr}\big(\frac{X_j}{\sum_i{X_i}},\frac{X_k}{\sum_i{X_i}} \big) = $$
$$\text{Corr}\big(1 - \frac{X_k}{\sum_i X_i} - \frac{\sum_{i\notin\{j,k\}}X_i}{\sum_i X_i}, 1 - \frac{X_j}{\sum_i X_i} - \frac{\sum_{i\notin\{j,k\}}X_i}{\sum_i X_i}\big)$$

Given an array of real numbers $A=[a_1,a_2,...,a_n]$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=0$, I want to prove that there is a reordering (via rotation only, not permutation) of the elements in the array, such that we will never get a negative temporary sum. It's a bit difficult and english is not my native tongue, I'll try to explain with an example. Let's look at the array $A=[1,-6,2,3]$. if we sum the elements we get $1+(-6)+2+3=0$. But $1+(-6)=-5$. So this is not a good ordering. Because while summing all of the elements, we had a temporary sum that is negative. However, if we rotate the array to $A'=[2,3,1,-6]$ then we have $2+3+1+(-6)=0$. And nowhere in this summation did we have a negative sum. Very important note: When I say reordering I don't mean permutation. I mean rotation only. if our original array was $A=[1,-6,2,3]$ then $A'=[3,2,1,-6]$ is not a valid reordering because we can't rotate $A$ and get to $A'$. I mean circular rotation only. Not permutation. What I tried to do: The first thing that came to mind is induction. It is simple to see that if $a_1+a_2=0$ then we have $3$ options: $a_1=a_2=0$ in which case any rotation will do, or $a_1>0>a_2$ or $a_2>0>a_1$. In any case it is possible to find a rotation that there will be no negative temporary sum. But how do we generalize it? Suppose I can find a good arrangement for an array with $k$ elements. Why does that mean I can find a good arrangement for an array with $k+1$ elements? Another idea would be to assume there is no such arrangement and then we hope to reach a contradiction to the total sum being zero. I failed to reach such a contradiction.","['summation', 'rotations', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

Since $g^{-1}$ is bijective, it is onto, so $\exists x\in g[B] \subset A \mid g^{-1}(x)=b$. Since $x\in A$, $\exists y\in f[A] \subset B \mid f(x) = y$.

Then $\exists x,y \in g[B] \mid f(x)=a, g^{-1}(x) = c,f(y)= b,$ and $g^{-1}(y) = c.$ Since $g^{-1}$ is injective and $g^{-1}(x) =c =g^{-1}(y)$, therefore $x=y$. So $a=f(x)=f(y)=b,$ and $R:A\to B$ is injective. Since $R$ and $f$ are both injective, $R \circ f:A\to B$  is injective.

There is then a partition of the first 168 $5$th powers into two sets such that their sums $A,\,B$ has $A-B = 480$. This is an optimization version of the partition problem with the constraint that the difference is minimal but does not vanish. (It is related to a previous question I asked on a "" Partition problem for consecutive kth powers "" where the difference must vanish.)","['integer-partitions', 'exponentiation', 'number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'polynomials']"
1218128,"Simple calculations of mean, standard deviation, and probability","You are a successful entrepreneur that has developed a new sustainable product that is manufactured through a standard production process. As part of this process, the product goes through quality assurance testing. The quality assurance inspector selects 10 units of your product at random from the production batch; if at least 3 units are defective, then the batch is rejected and will not be sold in stores. Previous records show that 10% of the products in each batch have issues. What is the mean number of defective units in the sample? What is the standard deviation of defective units in the sample? What is the probability that the batch will be rejected? I'm having a little trouble calculating the mean and standard deviation. However, what I have got so far was that the mean is 1, standard deviation is 3, then the probability would be 0.2514. I'm very unsure on my answer and would like to see if anyone can point out anything I'm doing wrong. Thanks a lot! :)","['normal-distribution', 'probability', 'statistics', 'standard-deviation']"

1218315,Continuous Percentage,"This is probably super easy for the experts here (I need to retake and practice a lot of math courses, its been a while). Suppose I have a shared bank account with N number of people. Anyone can add some amount to the account. Each person that adds money to the account needs to have a cumulative percentage that represents how much of the total balance they can lay claim to. So if 10 people add 10 dollars each, each person would own 10 percent of the account. If an 11th person comes in and adds 100 dollars, then the 11th person would own 50 percent of the account. However, the original percentages for the first 10 people are off now, since they would not own 10 percent of the total 200 dollars. Now everyones percentages would not be correct if you multiplied them times the total account value. Other scenarios like, let's say a wealthy benefactor gives 250 dollars to the account and then the government comes in an takes 30 dollars from the entire account. This further confuses all the percentages Is there anyway to keep a running percentage that each person owns without updating each ownage percentage for each person, everytime the account is changed ?
