1080760,"Find characteristic function of ZX+(1-Z)Y with X uniform, Y Poisson and Z Bernoulli","Let random variables $X, Y, Z$ independent. $X$ with uniform distribution on $[-a,a]$, $Y$ with Poisson distribution with parameter $ν$, $Z$ with Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$. Find the characteristic function of random variable $Z*X+(1-Z)Y$ I tried use the this idea, but i don't now, how i can apply it for discrete distribution. Why are they independent?(random variables) No, i can't understand the conversion to replacement Z by p and (1-p). Why we can do it?It is not the meaning of characteristic function.","['probability-theory', 'characteristic-functions', 'random-variables']"
1080777,For someone who is self-studying topology: what are the main topics to focus on?,"I will have to teach myself topology for the Math GRE Subject Test because, although I graduated with a math major, I never took topology. I have Munkres and Kelley, along with the Schaum's Outlines and am intimidated by the amount of material there is, and given my limited amount of time, I need to know where to focus. For example, I imagine that understanding what a topological space is more important to understanding Topology than understanding partial orderings, but I have no idea if I need to know partial orderings to understand something later. What topics are the most important in an undergraduate topology course? Chapter mappings with respect to Munkres textbook would be especially appreciated. If this question is too broad or inappropriate for this site, I can remove this question.","['general-topology', 'self-learning']"
1080778,Intuition for basic concepts in differential geometry,"Im studying a basic differential geometry course this semester.
In the class, we defined the concept of covariant derivative (connection) as a function which takes 2 vectors fields into a vector field and satisfies some algebraic properties of derivative (linearity, additivity and product rule). From this definition we showed that the connection can be specified by the Christoffel symbols.
The covariant derivative ""should be"" a way of differentiating vectors fields along vector fields. However, there are infinite covariant derivatives on any surface, so using a random one wont make sense.
We proved the ""fundamental theorem of Riemmanian geometry"" - existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection.
Except for the nice properties of the Levi-Civita connection - why should I believe it is actually a good way to differentiate vector fields? An example from analytical mechanics could be great since Im familiar with the subject and didnt learn general relativity yet. Another concern resulting from the first one is ""Why (in what sense) is parallel transport parallel?"". Parallel transport along a curve is defined using covariant derivative along the velocity field of the curve. In the euclidean space, the definition makes perfect sense - parallel transport is actually parallel. In other surfaces, the covariant derivative is 0, and I didn't find any geometric intuition about ""what is actually parallel"". Thanks, Tsuf.",['differential-geometry']
1080779,Finding all abelian groups such that there exists certain short exact sequence.,"I have to find all abelian groups $A$ such that there exists a short exact sequence $0\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{6}\rightarrow 0$.

1080789,Totally disconnected vs. totally separated.,"Assume all spaces are metric. Question. Does there exist a space $X$ which is totally disconnected (the components of $X$ are singletons), yet some quasicomponent of $X$ has nonempty interior? I know the deleted Knaster–Kuratowski fan (Cantor's leaky tent) is totally disconnected and has no singleton quasicomponents.  But the quasicomponents of this space have empty interior, right? The quasicomponents are the lines of rationals or irrationals starting at the base (the Cantor set) and ending at the top of the tent, so I think this would follow from the fact that the Cantor set has no isolated points. If the answer to my question is yes, are there extra conditions which guarantee all of the quasicomponents in a totally disconnected space have empty interior?  If a space is totally disconnected, has no isolated points, and is locally compact (Hausdorff of course), then the quasicomponents would be equal to the components - singletons - none of which have interior.  But local compactness seems a bit extreme!  Based on the K-K fan example I want to guess: Conjecture. If a totally disconnected space has no isolated points, then all of its quasicomponents have empty interior.","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'metric-spaces']"
1080795,Transform polygons into one another?,"I am aware that there must be no standard way to achieve this, but I don't know what has been done so far. I feel like I'm missing keywords to investigate further. I have any two 2D polygons $a$ and $b$, possibly concave but not crossed, and they share the same barycenter. How do I gradually transform $a$ into $b$, in a way that, for the resulting ""movie"" $(c_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$: each $c_t$ ""frame of the movie"" is a non-crossed polygon $c_0=a\ \&\ c_1 = b$ the number of vertices in $c_t$ respects $V(a) \leqslant V(C_t) \leqslant V(b)$ (or the other way round) for any $t$ the amount of ""area adjustment"" $\int_0^1{A'(t)^2\mathrm{d}t}$ is minimal, where $A'(t)$ is the derivative of the area of $c_t$ with respect to $t$. Or anything that would measure ""area adjustment"". The idea is that, if workers where digging material in and out to perform the transformation, they should perform the least effort. (no matter where the material is put and where it is taken out from) I am aware that there will be discontinuities if $V(a)\neq V(b)$, but I don't mind. What I'm more interested in is: what choices will I have to make? Are there interesting results that would help me build an algorithm finding a $c$? Are there interesting readings about interpolating polygons into one another? [UPDATE:] As suggested by Joseph O'Rourke, this is a really good reading about polygon morphing.
Based on the algorithm they suggest, what constraint should I use then for the morph to let the area of $c$ vary as few as possible between $A(a)$ and $A(b)$?","['geometry', 'polygons', 'algorithms', 'interpolation', 'transformation']"

1080830,Gradient of the distance function,"Let $\Omega$ be open, bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $d(x):=dist(x,\partial\Omega)$ denotes the distance of the point $x\in\Omega$ from the boundary $\partial\Omega$. Define function $$\xi:\overline{\Omega}\to[0,1]; \quad \xi(x):=\min\left\{\frac{d(x)}{\delta},1\right\},$$
where $\delta\in (0,1]$ is fixed. I would like to prove that the following estimate for gradient holds: $$|\nabla\xi|\leqslant \frac{1}{\delta} \quad a.e.$$. So far I concluded that when $d(x)\geqslant \delta$, then $\xi(x)=1$ and therefore $\nabla\xi(x)=0$ so the inequality holds. If $d(x)<\delta$ then $\xi(x)=\frac{d(x)}{\delta}$  and the only thing I know is that distance as a Lipschitz function is differentiable a.e. by Rademacher's Theorem so at least I am allowed to differentiate it. Of course if $x\in\partial\Omega$, then $\xi(x)=0$, so the natural conclusion is that $\xi$ must somehow 'get small' when $x$ pass through $\delta$-band in $\Omega$ to reach boundary. Still it does not help me to get the estimate. I would be very pleased to see rigorous proof of this inequality. Thank you very much,

$$\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin \pi x}{(y+e^x|\sin \pi x|)^2}dx \, dy $$ 
exists and is finite and then finding its value. Since $\sin \pi x$ takes positive and negative values, Tonelli does not apply and hence we should use Fubini.

$$S_k=\sum_{n=2}^{k} \frac{(-1)^{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}}{\ln{n}}$$.
Is $S_k$ or $S_{4k^2}$ convergent? I think $S_k$ isn't convergent, since for big enough $n$, the $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ will change more slowly than for small $n$, but I don't know how to show it formally. For $S_{4k^2}$, I think the series is also divergent since then $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is always even, so we consider
$$S_{4k^2}=\sum_{n=2}^{k} \frac{1}{\ln{n}},$$
but we know $1/\ln n$ is divergent, so $S_{4k^2}$ is divergent. Is my reasoning here correct?","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

1080937,Check proof about range of bounded linear operator.,"I have to prove that the range $\mathcal{R}(T)$ of bounded linear operator $T:X\rightarrow Y$; $X,Y$ normed spaces need not be closed in $Y$. As a hint I'm given that I could consider $T:\mathcal{l^{\infty}}\rightarrow \mathcal{l^{\infty}}$ where $y=Tx$ is such that $y_n=\frac{x_n}{n}$. Now my attempt is as follows: We take the sequence $y^{(n)}=(1,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},..., \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}, 0,0,...)$. Then clearly we can take for each $y^{(n)}$ a $x^{(n)}=(1, \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}},...,\frac{n}{\sqrt{n}},0,0,...)\in \mathcal{l^{\infty}}$ so that $Tx^{(n)}=y^{(n)}$, and thus $y^{(n)}\in \mathcal{R}(T)$. Consider, the limit $y=\lim_{n}y^{(n)}=(1,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},...)\in \mathcal{l^{\infty}}$. If this were to be in $\mathcal{R}(T)$, then we must have $x=(1, \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{3}{\sqrt{3}},...)\in \mathcal{l^{\infty}}$, but this is clearly not the case, since $x$ is a sequence increasing to $\infty$. Thus we have a converging sequence in $\mathcal{R}(T)$, whose limit is not in $\mathcal{R}(T)$, and thus $\mathcal{R}(T)$ cannot be closed. I wonder if this is correct, and even if it is I'm still curious about other proofs of this statements, with or without use of the suggested operator.

1081009,Simplifying $\sqrt {1+\sqrt 5}$,"I considered simplifying $\sqrt {1+\sqrt 5}$. So I started $(a+b \sqrt 5)^2 = 1 + \sqrt 5$. This gave me $a\color{blue}{^2} + 5b^2 =1 , 2ab = 1$ so the result was $ \sqrt{1+\sqrt 5} =  \sqrt{1/2 - i} + \dfrac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt{2 - 4i}}.$ I continued in the same spirit : $(a_2+b_2 i)^2 = 1/2 - i. $ $a_2^2 - b_2^2 = 1/2, 2a_2b_2 = -1.$ This gave me : $ \sqrt{1+\sqrt 5} = \dfrac{\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5}}{2} - \frac{1}{4} (\sqrt 5 - 1)(\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5})\color{blue}i +\dfrac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt{2 - 4i}}\tag1$ I was a bit surprised by the self-similarity. I got the feeling of "" periodic "" or "" fractal "" , like running in circles. It this normal to get this kind of self-similarity when the initial radical cannot be rewritten in simpler shorter form ( without complex numbers or nesting ) ? Are they ways to compute or theorems to know about just how many steps it takes to get the self-similarity ? Does this imply that the number of nontrivial non-nested expressions for a real radical is Always finite ? edit Perhaps this edit clarifies a bit what I meant. Basicly the only identities and substitutions for identities we can have are : $ \sqrt{1+\sqrt 5} =  \sqrt{1/2 - i} + \sqrt{1/2 + i}$ $ \sqrt{1/2+ i} = \dfrac{\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5}}{2} - \frac{1}{4} (\sqrt 5 - 1)(\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5})i$ $ \sqrt{1/2- i} = \dfrac{\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5}}{2} + \frac{1}{4} (\sqrt 5 - 1)(\sqrt{1+\sqrt 5})i$ And no more than those 3. Or 2 if we do not count conjugates as seperate. Now I suspect this mysterious number 2 is no coincidence ; Conjecture If a nested root form containing only sqrts , positive integers and additions (thus no divisions or substractions ) is given that cannot be simplified within the same ring then the amount of identities ( as in the example above , ignoring conjugates ) is at most the amount of sqrt's in the expression. In this case 2 sqrt's => 2 identities. edit comment A similar thing happens with $\sqrt{5+\sqrt 3}$. You end up with a $\sqrt{10+2\sqrt 22}$ term and when you go on you end up with $\sqrt{5+\sqrt 3}$ again. Here $\sqrt{10+2\sqrt 22}$ takes on the "" role "" of $\sqrt{1/2 + i}$ but this examples demonstrates that the phenomenon can stay within the reals too. These examples are fairly easy to check and in that sense they may appear trivial , but there must be more behind this. 
The same thing happens for cuberoots for example , and that gives us a mimimum polynomial of degree 9 which is much less well understood then degree 4. Similar things happen if we use Bring radicals. Although intuitive and easy to check any particular example by basic algebra , group and ring theory ... The basic framework is unclear to me.

1081021,Lebesgue Integral of Non-Measurable Function,"In what follows I'm only considering positive real valued functions. Everywhere I look about the definition of the Lebesgue integral it is required to consider a measurable function. Why do we not define the integral for non-measurable functions? From what I see we require measurablility of the simple functions that approximate f, not f itself. The definition I'm considering is given a measure space $X$ with measure $\mu$ and a measurable function $f$ we define $$
\int_E f \, \mathrm{d}\mu = \sup_{s \in S} \int_X s \,\mathrm{d}\mu
$$
where $S = \{ s : X \to [0, \infty) \mid 0 \le s \le f, s \text{ is simple, measurable} \}$. For example consider $\mathbb{R}$ with the sigma algebra $\varnothing, \mathbb{R}$ with measure $\mu$ given by $\mu(\varnothing) = 0, \mu(\mathbb{R}) = 1$ and consider $f = \chi_{[0,1]}$ then why can't we say that
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} f \,\mathrm{d} \mu = 0
$$
(since the only measurable simple function such that $0\le s \le f$ is $s = 0$) which would follow the definition above? Is this not well defined? In general I'm struggling to see why measurable functions (other than measurable simple functions) are used.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
1081028,prove conjecture; the limit of iterating is $\sqrt{z^2 - 2}$,"$$\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)=x-\frac{1}{nx}\;\;\; g(x)=f_n^{on}(x)$$ The conjecture is for values of $|x|>\sqrt{2}$: $g(x) = \sqrt{z^2 - 2}$ This question comes from another matstack question/answer . If $n=2^m$, then convergence is much quicker by starting with $f_n(x)=x-\frac{1}{nx}$ and then iterating the Taylor/Laurent series for $f(x) \mapsto f(f(x))$ m times.  I start by generating the formal Taylor series after moving the fixed point from infinity to zero, $1/f(\frac{1}{x})\;$.  Then we start iterating with $f_n$ $$f_n(x) = \frac{x}{1 - x^2/n} =  x + \frac{x^3}{n} + \frac{x^5}{n^2} + \frac{x^7}{n^3} + \frac{x^9}{n^4} + \frac{x^{11}}{n^5} ...$$ Using this speedup with $m=\log_2(n)$, one can iterate the Taylor series for $f(x) \mapsto f(f(x))$ m times, rather then iterating $f^{on}$, but the two are of course identical.  Its just that otherwise convergence is pretty slow, with n iterations to get accuracy to 1/n. The formal Taylor series coefficients of $1/g(\frac{1}{x}) = \sqrt{z^2/(1-2z^2)}$ are:
$x + x^3 +
\frac{3        x^5    }{2     } +

EDIT I ( https://math.stackexchange.com/users/39261/mick ) will place a bounty for the following problem : Basicly the inverse : Suppose we are given $g(x)=\sqrt{x^2-2}$ and we are asked to find $f_n$ such that : $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \;\;\; g(x)=f_n^{on}(x)$$ How do we solve such problems ?? EDIT EDIT 2 As Sheldon's comment says $f_n(x)=\sqrt{x^2-\frac{2}{n}}$ is also a solution but I want to find the $f_n$ from the OP : $x - \frac{1}{nx}$ or another $f_n$ that is real-meromorphic on the entire complex plane.

But how do you show the second part? $$\left| \int_{\color{blue}{\gamma'_n}} g(w) \text{d}w\right| \leqslant 2\int_{\color{blue}{\gamma'_n}} |w^{z-1}| |\text{d}w |$$ For instance (Caution for the branch cut) Using $|w^{z-1}| = |w|^{a-1}e^{-b\arg w}$ if $\operatorname{Im} w>0$ and $\Gamma_1 \leftrightarrow w(y) = n+ iy$ where $y:i\to (2n+1)\pi$ . $$\ldots \leqslant 2\int_{1}^{(2n+1)\pi} |n+iy|^{a-1} e^{—b\arg (n+iy)} d y$$ But why would this $\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ ? I know that as $n\to \infty$ , $e^{—b\arg(n+iy)}$ can be bounded by a constant. (according to the sign of $b$ ) But is $|n+iy|^{a-1}$ unbounded as $n\to \infty$ .

1081057,The Gauss-Green theorem for unbounded domain,"This question comes to me when I deal with the following PDE problem. Suppose we have 
\begin{cases}
-\Delta u=0 & x\in \mathbb R^N\setminus B(0,1)\\
u=0 & x\in\partial B(0,1)\\
u\to 0 & |x|\to\infty
\end{cases}
Then I am going to prove that $u\equiv 0$. This problem can be proven very quickly by using Maximum Principle. But I got boring tonight and try to use energy method to prove this problem. I start with
$$ 0=\int_{\mathbb R^N\setminus B(0,1)} \Delta u\, u\,dx = -\int_{\mathbb R^N\setminus B(0,1)} |\nabla u|^2\,dx+\int_{\partial B(0,1)} \nabla u\,u\,\nu d\sigma $$
and the last term is $0$ because of the boundary condition and we done. Here I realize that I am using Gauss-Green theorem to do integration by parts on the unbounded domain and the integration over the boundary of $\mathbb R^N$
at ""infinity"" has been ignored by the condition $u\to 0$ as $|x|\to \infty$. I remember I proved this result from my old classes... But now I can not justify it. I tried to do the following by taking $$ 0=\int_{B(0,R)\setminus B(0,1)} \Delta u\, u\,dx = -\int_{B(0,R)\setminus B(0,1)} |\nabla u|^2\,dx+\int_{\partial B(0,1)} \nabla u\,u\,\nu d\sigma+\int_{\partial B(0,R)} \nabla u\,u\,\nu d\sigma $$
and I try to take $R\to \infty$. But I don't see why
$$ \lim_{R\to \infty} \int_{\partial B(0,R)} \nabla u\,u\,\nu d\sigma=0$$ 
even if $u$ vanish at infinity because we don't know the rate of vanishing and no information of $\nabla u$... Update: Based on @Jose27's answer, my question has been well-solved. But in addition, I have a interested question here for case $N=2$. It looks to me that for $N=2$, we need $\lim_{|x|\to \infty} u(x)$ to be exists, and hence we have $u$ is actually bounded. Moreover, from Folland PDE book, page 115, proposition 2.74 I read that the following statement is equivalent if $u$ is harmonic outside $B(0,1)$, for $N=2$: (a): $|u(x)|=o(\log|x|)$ as $x\to \infty$ (b): $|u(x)|=O(1)$ as $x\to\infty$ Quickly we have $(b)\implies (a)$. For converse, we notice that if $u$ satisfies $(a)$, then we have $\bar{u}$ is bounded and in turn $u$ is bounded as well.","['partial-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

1081110,What is the motivation/applications for the definition of Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^n$?,"The definition of the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^n$ is fundamentally tied up with the following assumption: The measure of the cartesian product of $n$ intervals should be the product of the lengths of those intervals. That is to say, to define measure on $\mathbb R^n$, we just blindly generalize the formula for the area of a rectangle or the volume of a cuboid. Why do this? Cartesian products of intervals, and the concept of multiplying their lengths together, are only relevant in $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$. In fact, even there, they're only relevant when those sets are being interpreted as models for physical space. If I was working on a two-variable problem in which the variables were temperature and pressure, then measuring the ""size"" of the set of all configurations with temperature in $[0, 2]$ and pressure in $[5, 3]$ (say) by multiplying together $|2-0|$ and $|5-3|$ would seem like a very irrelevant thing to do.

1081366,Algebra of matrix coefficient over a compact group is isomorphic to its dual.,"Let $K$ be a compact group. Then we have the following definition of matrix coefficient: Definition: $f: K \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is called a matrix coefficient if there is a finite dimensional semisimple $K$-module $V$ with $\alpha \in V^*, v\in V$ such that $f(k) = \alpha(kv)$ for all $k\in K$.

Let $\zeta \in R^v(K)$ be defined by $\zeta(\alpha\otimes v) = \alpha(v)$ if $\gamma $ is trivial and $0$ otherwise. My Question is: Can we show that $R(K) \cong R^v(K)$ via $f \mapsto\zeta(f\cdot)$? Thanks very much!","['matrices', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups']"
1081372,Continuous extension on compact set in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"I'm an undergrad student reading through Deimling's Nonlinear Functional Analysis and have come across the following proposition. Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be compact and $f:A\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be a continuous function. Then there exists a continuous extension $\tilde{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\tilde{f}(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in A$. The proof goes as follows: Let $S=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots\}$ be a countable dense subset of $A$ and define $$\varphi_i(x) := \max\left\{ 2-\frac{|x-a_i|}{\rho(x,A)},0 \right\}\quad\text{for $x\not\in A$}$$
where $\rho$ denotes distance. Then the function $$ \tilde{f}(x) =\begin{cases}
f(x),&x\in A\\
\left(\sum_{i\geq1}2^{-i}\varphi_i(x)\right)^{-1}\left(\sum_{i\geq1}2^{-i}\varphi_i(x)f(a_i)\right),&x\not\in A
\end{cases} $$
satisfies the extension. QED. My understanding: Clearly, $\tilde{f}$ is continuous on the interior of $A$ and using the Weierstrass M-test I can show that $\tilde{f}$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash A$. All that remains is to show that $\tilde{f}$ is continuous on the boundary of $A$ and this is where I am having no luck. Apologies in advance if the following is not clear, but I'm not sure how to proceed.
As I play around with the expression for $\tilde{f}$ at some $x\in\mathbb{R}^n\backslash A$, it almost seems like we have a weighted average of values of $f$ on $A$ near $x$. However, my intuition begins to break down when looking at any finite sum because it seems that the order of enumeration of each $a_i$ may have more of an effect in the sum than the closeness of $a_i$ to $x$, i.e. the closer values may appear too late in the sum and the factor $2^{-i}$ may make these values insignificant. Maybe the division by the first factor accommodates for this, but I cannot be sure exactly what's going on here. Can anyone clarify my intuition here or, better yet, give me some hints on how to show continuity on the boundary of $A$? Thanks","['continuity', 'compactness', 'analysis']"

1081420,Probability of royal flush dealt to table of n players,"I'm interested in calculating the probability of a royal flush being dealt to ANY of the n players seated at a Texas Hold'em poker game (2 hole cards, 5 community cards). The probability of YOU being dealt a royal flush is readily available on the internet but I'm having trouble finding this particular probability, especially for variable number of players. There are $133,784,560$ 7-hand combinations, $4,324$ of which result in a royal flush so the probability of YOU being dealt a royal flush is $\approx 0.00003232$ It seems that simply $n*0.00003232$ will give a good approximation to the probability I'm after but something seems off about this in that 1 player receiving a royal flush would negate anyone else from receiving a royal flush (except in the case of a royal being on the board). In an attempt to come up with an exact solution I've done the following: Number of ways to deal n-handed NLHE hand (sample space): $$52!/(52-2n-5)! = 52!/(47-2n)!$$ Number of ways royal can be dealt using BOTH hole cards: $$4*n*5*4*{5\choose 3}*3!*(47!/(47-2n)!)$$ (suit,player,1st hole card,2nd hole card,community placement,community order,distribute remaining cards) Number of ways royal can be dealt using ONLY 1 hole card: $$4*n*{2\choose 1}*5*{5\choose 4}*4!*(47!/(47-2n)!)$$ (suit,player,which hole card,hole card,community placement,community order,distribute remaining cards) And finally, number of ways royal can be dealt using 0 hole cards (royal on board) $$4*5!*(47!/(47-2n)!)$$ (suit,community cards,remaining cards) Thus giving the probability of a royal being dealt to ANY player in an n-handed NLHE game being: $$((4*n*5*4*{5\choose 3}*3!*(47!/(47-2n)!)+4*n*{2\choose 1}*5*{5\choose 4}*4!*(47!/(47-2n)!)+4*5!*(47!/(47-2n)!))/(52!/(47-2n)!))$$ For n=1 this gives the $\approx 0.00003232$ as we should expect and for n=9 this yields $181/6497400\approx0.000278573$ which is, as I'd expect, quite close to $9*0.00003232\approx0.00029088$. So, I have 3 real questions: 1.) Are my intuitions about n*[7 card probability] being ONLY an approximation correct? 2.) Is my ""exact"" equation correct? Besides my n=1,n=9 substitutions are there are external sources I can check this against? It's been awhile since I've worked with probability and I'm not too confident in my solution. 3.)

$$y= y_{A/B}+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot(x-x_{A/B})$$
$$
\text{where} 
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_A-y_B}{x_A-x_B}=\frac{y_B-y_A}{x_B-x_A}$$ Demonstration: The equation for a generic line in the cartesian plane is $y=mx+c$. We know that
$$\tan(\alpha)=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{y_B-y_a}{x_B-x_A}=\frac{y_A-y_B}{x_A-x_B}$$ Since $\alpha=\tan^{-1}(\tan\alpha)$
$$\alpha=\tan^{-1} \frac{y_B-y_a}{x_B-x_A}=\tan^{-1}\frac{y_A-y_B}{x_A-x_B}$$
From this post here we have that $\alpha = \tan^{-1}(m)$ so we have:
$$\alpha = \tan^{-1}(m)=\tan^{-1}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\rightarrow m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \tag {1}$$ If $y = mx+c$ then $c=y-mx$ where $y$ and $x$ are the coordinates of a generic point on the line; so we can rewrite $$c=y_A -\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x_A=y_B -\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x_B = y_{A/B} -\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x_{A/B} \tag 2$$
Finally we have:
$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \tag {1}$ $c=y_{A/B} -\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x_{A/B} \tag 2$
And since $y= mx+c$ the final equation is:
$$y=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x + y_{A/B} -\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot x_{A/B} ; \ y=y_{A/B} + \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\cdot (x-x_{A/B})$$

&= \frac{2\sin{\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}}\cos{\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}}\cos{\frac{x}{2^{n-2}}} \cdots\cos{\frac{x}{2}}}{2\sin{\frac{x}{2^{n-1}}}}

1081823,An infinite series that gives $f(s)=s$. How could it be explained more easily?,"This question loosely builds this one.

\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^{2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x^{n}} + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - 1/x} = \frac{x}{x-1}

Adding both equations
\begin{equation}
2 + x + \frac{1}{x} + x^{2} + \frac{1}{x^{2}} + \cdots + x^{n} + \frac{1}{x^{n}} + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - x} + \frac{x}{x-1} = \frac{1-x}{1-x} = 1

\begin{equation}
2 + x + \frac{1}{x} + x^{2} + \frac{1}{x^{2}} + \cdots + x^{n} + \frac{1}{x^{n}} + \cdots = 1

Then:
  $$\int_{(a,b)}f\cdot g'=(f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a))-\int_{(a,b)}f'\cdot g.$$ I would like to extend this theorem to the case when the interval of integration is right-unbounded. What is the most natural statement for this case? I don't think that continuous on $[a,\infty)$ and differentiable on $(a,\infty)$ is sufficient, since the direct analogue would be ""continuous on $[a,\infty]$"" which suggests that the behavior at $\infty$ needs to be controlled in some way - I suspect that it should be sufficient to require that the real limit of the function exist. That said, how is something like this proven? In principle I should just be able to take a limit as $b\to\infty$ in the above theorem, but what is the appropriate theorem for taking the limit of a sequence of base sets in an integral? Something like: If $A_n$ is a sequence of subsets of $\Bbb R$ satisfying <condition> and $f:\bigcup_n A_n\to\Bbb C$ is Lebesgue integrable on each $A_n$, and $A=\lim_n A_n$ (whatever that means), then $f$ is integrable on $A$ and $$\int_A f=\lim_n\int_{A_n}f.$$","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

1081952,Help understanding the argument used in this proof that $SO(n)$ is path-connected,"Background: I am reading Tapp's matrix groups for undergraduates and I am in the process of showing that $SO(3)$ is path-connected. While working on my own arguemnt I found a proof online in these lecture notes . But I need some help understanding the argument. The proof is this: $SO(1) = \{1\}$ so for $n=1$ we see that $SO(n)$ is path-connected. Assume that $SO(n-1)$ is path-connected. Consider the continuous action of $SO(n)$ on $\mathbb R^n$ by left multiplication. The stabilizer of $e_n$ is $SO(n − 1) \le SO(n)$ thought of as the closed subgroup of matrices of the form
$$\begin{pmatrix}
P & 0\\
0^T & 1

with $P \in SO(n − 1)$ and $0$ the $(n − 1) \times 1$ zero matrix. The orbit of $e_n$ is the unit sphere $S^{n−1}$ which is path connected. Since the orbit space is also diffeomorphic to $SO(n)/ SO(n − 1)$ we have the inductive step. I have some questions about this proof: (1) What is $e_n$? The standard basis of $\mathbb R^n$? (2) Is there a theorem ""If a group $G$ acts continuously on $\mathbb R^n$ and the orbits of the basis elements are path-connected then so is $G$""? (3) Where in the proof is it used that the stabilizer is $SO(n-1)$? (4) I assume that since we showed that the orbit space is
  path-connected and we assume that it is diffeomorphic to
  $SO(n)/SO(n-1)$ then $SO(n)/SO(n-1)$ is also path-connected. Is there

Suppose $M$ is a compact smooth orientable hypersurface of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with the Gauss map $N\colon M\to S^n$ and $0\neq v\in\mathbb R^{n+1}$. Let $f_v(x)=\langle x,v\rangle$ be a so-called height function. Since $M$ is compact, we can take a maximal point $p\in M$ and a minimal point $q\in M$ of $f_v$ restricted on $M$. It's not difficult to show that $N(p),N(q),v$ are collinear. Is it true that $N(p)+N(q)=0$, i.e., $N(p),N(q)$ are of opposite direction? Discussion If $M$ is a level hypersurface, i.e., the zero set of a submersion $F\colon\mathbb R^{n+1}\to\mathbb R$, then the statement is true. The idea of the proof is depicted as follows. Take a sufficient large sphere $S\subseteq\mathbb R^{n+1}$, and then we can use it to construct a continuous path $\alpha\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb R^{n+1}$, differentiable at $p$ and $q$, such that $\alpha(a)=p,\alpha(b)=q,\alpha'(a)=\alpha'(b)=v$, but $\alpha(t)\not\in M$ for $a<t<b$. For more details, see J. A. Thorpe's Elementary Topics in Differential Geometry , Chapter 6, page 33. If the compactness is removed, even if $f_v$ attains its maximum and minimum, the statement is false. Consider $n=1$ and $M$ to be the graph of $y=\sin x$ and take $v=(0,1)$. I heard that there's a magic theorem that any compact (smooth) hypersurface in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is a level hypersurface and therefore orientable. I don't want to appeal to such a theorem.

My Solution: 1) First convert the given English sentences to logical propositions Let J, S, K represent Jasmine, Samir, Kanti attending the party. So the propositions become: $J\Rightarrow\not S$ $S\Rightarrow K$ $\not J\Rightarrow\not K$ 2) For three variables, $2^3 = 8$ Truth Value Combinations are Possible. We need to find a combination which is consistent with the above set of propositions. 3) Clearly the combination that works is : J-True ; K-True ; S-False 4) Hence, one should invite Jasmine and Kanti and leave out Samir.
