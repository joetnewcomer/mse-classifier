192656,Characteristic functions (Statistics),"I would greatly appreciate any help with this problem. If $f_1, f_2 , f_3$ are three characteristic functions (in Statistics, e.g $E(\exp(itX)))$ such that $f_1*f_3=f_2*f_3$ for all $t$ and we are given that $f_3$ is non-zero almost everywhere, how can we show that $f_1 = f_2$ for ALL $t$? It's obvious that $f_1 = f_2$ for $t$ not in the null set where $f_3 $ is non-zero, but how can we conclude that $f_1 = f_2$ for $t$ in the null set where $f_3$ is zero?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'characteristic-functions']"

192720,Automorphic numbers,"Problem . We say that the $n$-digit number $x$ is automorphic iff $x^2\equiv x \mod(10^n)$. Prove that if $x$ is $n$-digit automorphic number then $(3x^2-2x^3)\mod(10^{2n})$ is $2n$-digit automorphic number. Hint: use Chinese reminder theorem to find the necessary and sufficient condition for number to be automorphic. So from Chinese reminder theorem we have that $x$ is automorphic iff: $$ \begin{cases} x(x-1)\equiv 0 \mod(2^n)\\ x(x-1)\equiv 0 \mod(5^n)\end{cases} $$ which gives us four systems of equations:
$$ \begin{cases} x\equiv 0 \mod(2^n)\\ x\equiv 0 \mod(5^n)\end{cases} $$
$$ \begin{cases} x\equiv 1 \mod(2^n)\\ x\equiv 1 \mod(5^n)\end{cases} $$

192732,"If $|f(z)|=1$ , $f$ is holomorphic then $f$ is constant","Let $G\subset \mathbb{C}$ be a region, $f$ a holomorphic function. Then it does hold that: If $f(G) \subset \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow  f$ is constant If $|f(z)|=1$ for all $z \in G$, then $f$ is constant. Proof of 1: $f$ is holomorphic, so it holds that $$u_x=v_y; u_y=-v_x$$ where $f(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$, then $u_x=0$ and $u_y=0$ so $u,v$ both must be constant Proof of 2: $$|f(z)|= 1 \Rightarrow u^2+v^2=1 $$ taking the partial derivatives: $$2uu_x+2vv_x=0 , 2uu_y+2vv_y= 0$$ putting inside the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$uu_x-vu_y=(u^2u_x^2-2uvu_xu_y+v^2u_y^2)=0; uu_y+vu_x=(u^2u_y^2+2uvu_xu_y+v^2v_y^2)=0$$ so either $u=v = 0$ or $u_x=u_y=0$
so $$\Leftrightarrow (u^2+v^2)(u_x^2+u_y^2)=0.$$ If everything was done correctly so far, wouldn't

192784,Trends in the distribution of reordered digits of Pi (OEIS A096566),"First let me try to describe in more details below the approach of
""reordering"" digits of Pi, which is used in OEIS A096566 https://oeis.org/A096566 and what I have done analyzing it so far. I am looking at first 620 ""reordered"" digits (which is more than currently listed in A096566) of Pi (in decimal representation). The reordering is done in such way that, while looking at consecutive pipeline stream of digits, all ""range"" of 10 different decimal digits: 1,2,...,7,8,9,0 in their first occurrence are getting ""collected"",  while all coming ""repeating"" digits of each kind (1,2,...,7,8,9,0 ) are getting ""pushed back"" to be written later ... . Then the second ""next"" unique ten digits are getting collected, that is written,  first looking for them in already ""pushed back"" group and then looking for coming-in (again  with all ""repeating"" digits getting ""pushed back"") and so on until entire (second) set of all unique digits (1,2,...,7,8,9,0 ) is completely collected (written). In total - I got 62 such sets (covering 62*10 decimal digits)  -  see all those 62 sets listed below - where each  {....}  line represents the set of such 10 digits collection. {3,1,4,5,9,2,6,8,7,0}

 {1,2,3,4,6,9,8,7,0,5} Here are results of arithmetic averages which I got for each (out of ten) positions between those 62 sets: first position  digits  average    4.694538 second position  digits  average   4.306452 third position  digits  average    4 forth position  digits  average    5.048387097 fifth position  digits  average    4.951612903 sixth position  digits  average    4.548387097 seventh position  digits  average  4.161290323 eights position  digits  average   4.274193548 ninths position  digits  average   2.870967742 tenth position  digits  average    6.14516129 Above results show that for the first eight positions, digits in each position were changing from the set to set progressively more and more randomly - thus averages for those positions are getting closer to 4.5 . However for positions 9 and 10 - such randomization was not achieved yet within first 62 sets ...(though looking outside of presented so far 62 sets data and relying on the known observation that eventually the average digit value in the decimal expansion of Pi comes practically to 4.5), I could ""speculate"" in advance that it will come to 4.5 eventually and for positions 9 and 10 too ... - but it looks like that positions 9 and 10 are ""randomizing"" at much slowly rate than the other 8 positions ... and that might be (or might not be) interesting. I am not sure  how many more sets (beyond 62, which I presented here) are needed to get arithmetic averages for ""ninth"" and ""tenth"" digit positions (within the set) to reach the same proximity of 4.5 for average value, as it is achieved already by first 8 positions within those 62 sets ... . It is also notable that if to average positions 9 and 10 together, the average between those two, within available so far 62 sets, will be close to 4.5. Conclusion and questions There appears to be that those first 62 sets listed above have a slight hint of retaining some loose organizational order between predecessor sets and successor sets. But I presume that further ""down the road"", beyond the first 62 sets, one will see that  gradually the level of randomness in sets digits composition order is increasing and adjacent sets become more more disconnected from each other. What I am trying to say that in case of digits Pi (after applied above discussed reordering) it appears that there exists some sort of transition from initial order (within first 620 digits) to total randomness ... I used Maximal information-based nonparametric exploration statistical analysis program (MINE) by ""David Reshef at al "". Being applied (by me ) ""pairwise"" to the first 62 terms, MINE shows high values (up to 1) of the  maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is a measure of two-variable dependence designed specifically for rapid exploration of many-dimensional data sets. The links (thanks to LVK for the upload) to the excel spreadsheet, turned into the comma separated value file (.csv),  with the data (62 sets of reordered Pi digits) and the MINE generated output .csv file, which was produced (at my home PC Windows based computer) upon executing java -jar MINE.jar PiReordered.csv -allPairs  cv=1.0 correspondingly are https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv and https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv%2Callpairs%2Ccv%3D1.0%2CB%3Dn%5E0.6%2CResults.csv Does such concept of transition from order to randomness exist ? Could this above observation be statistically confirmed or disproved ? If ""yes"" -  what specific tools / methods of statistical analysis could be applied ? I also received suggestion that in order to test whether this discussed above feature is only characteristic to (some initial digits of) Pi, the same reordering should be applied to the some significant number of randomly generated very long strings of decimal digits  - to see if there the same pattern behavior will appear or not - is it useful ?

""The nth line of your table consists of the digits written in the order of their nth appearance in π.

The table presentation with the columns representing the particular combination of (all) digits (from 1 to 0 in above mentioned set) for each consecutive ten digit collection is, in my opinion, more revealing in that regard. My questions still remain to be in place: 1) is there some ""other"" (I would call it ""transitional"") non-randomness exists for some few hundreds ""initial"" digits of Pi (beyond the order imposed by the re-arrangement itself), which is getting revealed by this re-arrangement ? 2) what (other than MINE) quantative statistical methods/tools could be used in analysis of this situation - PPS

192820,Trivilisations of Vector Bundles,"Let $\pi : E \to X$ be a smooth rank $k$ vector bundle on a manifold $X$ (I don't think my question depends upon the stipulations on the bundle, but I've just chosen smooth in case I'm incorrect). By definition, for every $x \in X$, there exists an open set $U \subseteq X$, with $x \in U$, such that $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is diffeomorphic to $U\times\mathbb{R}^k$; we say that $U$ trivialises the bundle. The prototypical example of a smooth vector bundle on a manifold $X$ is the tangent bundle $TX$. For this bundle (in fact any tensor bundle), any coordinate neighbourhood on $X$ trivialises the bundle. My question is whether this happens for every vector bundle. Let $\pi : E \to X$ be a smooth rank $k$ vector bundle on a manifold $X$. Does every coordinate neighbourhood on $X$ trivialise the bundle?

192826,"Quasi-coherent sheaves, schemes, and the Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem","In the context of commutative rings, a ring is completely determined by its category of modules. That is, two commutative rings $R$ and $S$ are isomorphic if and only if the category of $R$-modules is equivalent to the category of $S$-modules. In particular, we have the following result about affine schemes: If $X=(X,\mathcal O_X)$ is a scheme, let $QCoh(X)$ denote the category of quasi-coherent $\mathcal O_X$-modules on $X$. Then, two affine schemes $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic if and only if $QCoh(X)$ is equivalent to $QCoh(Y)$. (This follows from the fact that if $X=Spec(R)$ for a commutative ring $R$, then $QCoh(X)$ is equivalent to the category of $R$-modules.) My question is the following: For a general scheme $X$, to what extent does $QCoh(X)$ determine $X$?

192835,Fast(est) and intuitive ways to look at matrix multiplication?,"Most of the time I see matrix multiplication presented and defined , as a seemingly arbitrary sequence of operations. For example, the textbook I'm currently reading for a linear algebra course defines the product $AB$ as the $(i, j)$ entry in the $1 \times 1$ matrix that is the product of the ith row of $A$ and the jth column of $B$. Properties of matrix multiplication are subsequently proven based upon this definition. The definition is clear, but why the matrix product is useful is not clear to me as a student. A different textbook I'm referencing defines the product $AB$ in terms of linear combinations. The problem I have is doing matrix multiplication quickly by hand, particularly when the $A$ is $p \times 1$ and $B$ is $1 \times q$.

192841,Finding the MLE for parameter $\theta$ from distribution of the form $e^{-|x-\theta|}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Finding the maximum likelihood estimator (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . this is my first post so I apologize if the formatting is a little rocky. I'm currently going through ""Probability and Statistics"" 4th ed by DeGroot/Schervish, and I was wondering if somebody could help me out on two related problems (7.5.10, 7.6.1). The first question is as follows: Suppose that $ X_1, \dots, X_n $ form a random sample from a distribution for which the p.d.f. $ f(x|\theta) $ is as follows: $$ f(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-|x-\theta|} \text{ for } -\infty < x < \infty $$ Also, suppose that the value of $ \theta $ is unknown, for $ -\infty < \theta < \infty $. We will find the M.L.E. of $ \theta $. The likelihood function is given by $$ f_n(\mathbf{x}|\theta) = \frac{1}{2^n} e^{-\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \theta|}$$ and will be maximized when $ \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \theta| $ is minimized. By choosing $ \theta $ to be a median value of $ x_1, \dots, x_n $, we accomplish the minimization task. More specifically, note that the likelihood function has log \begin{align*}
\log f(\mathbf{x}|\theta) &= -n \log 2 - \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \theta| \\
&= n \left ( - \log 2 - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \theta| \right )
\end{align*} Now, we see that the M.L.E. will minimize the sum in the log likelihood shown above. We can also see that $ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \theta| = E(|X-\theta|)$ for $ X $ having a discrete distribution assigning probability $ \frac{1}{n} $ to each of $ x_1, \dots, x_n $, and 0 everywhere else. So now we can see that, by choosing $ \hat{\theta} $ to be a median of $ x_1, \dots, x_n $, then the log likelihood will be minimized. This follows from the fact that the median of a distribution minimizes the mean absolute error. The second question is to find the MLE of $e^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}$, which by the invariance property of MLEs, should just be $e^{-\frac{1}{\hat{\theta}}}$. My problem is that the answer in the back of the book (for the second question) is given as $\left ( \prod_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, and I'm having trouble reconciling that with my answer. You'd think it'd be pretty straightforward, but... Any help would be appreciated!",['statistics']

Further assuming that random guessers are normally distributed, his z-score is (103-90)/8.22 = 1.58, making him an outlier. This places him in the top 6% of random guessers. This suggest that either

I specifically want to consider the case where the $p_i$ are far from being equal. Q1: What would the grand prize be worth if the lottery is fair? Q2: What would be a fair price to sell a coupon of type $C_i$ to other players? The obvious answer $1\over p_i$ seems to be wrong because in order to collect all other coupons one has to buy so many lots anyway that it is likely to find a $C_i$ while doing that (unless $p_i\ll p_j$ for $j\ne i$) Q3: Assume two players have collected subsets $A$, $B$ of $\mathcal C=\{C_1, \ldots, C_n\}$ such that $A\cup B=\mathcal C$.

The subordinate matrix infinity norm is defined as: $$\|A\|_{\infty} =\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}|a_{ij}|.$$ This is derived from the general definition of a subordinate matrix norm which is defined as: $$\|A\| = \max \left\{\frac{\|Ax\|}{\|x\|} : x \in K^{n}, x \neq 0\right\}.$$ I wanted to try this out in an example.  So say we define the matrix: $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 4 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}.$$ Now if we use the first definition, it is easy to see that $\|A\|_{\infty} = 11$ But if we use the general definition, we get: $$\|A\|_{\infty} =\max \left\{\frac{\|Ax\|_{\infty}}{\|x\|_{\infty}} : x \in K^{n}, x \neq 0\right\}.$$ Now, we have: $$Ax = \begin{bmatrix} 15 \\ 11 \\ 21 \end{bmatrix}.$$ Since the infinity vector norm is defined as: $$\|x\|_{\infty} =\max_{1 \leq i \leq n} |x_i|$$ it follows that: $$\|Ax\|_{\infty} = 21$$ and: $$\|x\|_{\infty} = 3$$ But then we have: $$\frac{\|Ax\|_{\infty}}{\|x\|_{\infty}} = \frac{21}3 = 7$$ that does not correlate with the fact that we previously found that $\|A\|_{\infty} = 11$.

Now $\mu$ and $i$ are then supposed to define maps from the coordinate ring of $\Bbb{C}$ (namely $\Bbb{C}[T]$, $T$ an indeterminate) to $\Bbb{C}[T \times T]$ and $\Bbb{C}[T]$ respectively.

Integrate by parts with
$$u = \cos^{n-1} x, dv = \cos x \ dx \implies du = (n-1)\cos^{n-2} x \cdot -\sin x, v = \sin x$$ which leads to $$I_n = \sin x \ \cos^{n-1} x +\int\sin^2 x (n-1) \ \cos^{n-2} x \ dx \tag{2}$$ Since $(n-1)$ is a constant, we can throw it out front of the integral: $$I_n = \sin x \ \cos^{n-1} x +(n-1)\int\sin^2 x \ \cos^{n-2} x \ dx\tag{3}$$ I can transform the integral a bit because $\sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 \implies \sin^2 x = 1-\cos^2 x$ $$I_n = \sin x \ \cos^{n-1} x + (n-1)\int(1-\cos^2 x) \ \cos^{n-2} x \ dx \tag{4}$$ According to Wikipedia as noted here , this simplifies to: $$I_n = \sin x \ \cos^{n-1} x + (n-1) \int \cos^{n-2} x \ dx - (n-1)\int(\cos^n x) \ dx \tag{5}$$ Question 2 : How did they simplify the integral of $\int(1-\cos^2 x) \ dx$ to $\int(\cos^n x) \ dx$? Assuming knowledge of equation 5, I see how to rewrite it as $$I_n = \sin x \ \cos^{n-1} x + (n-1) I_{n-2} x  - (n-1) I_{n} \tag{6}$$ and solve for $I_n$. I had tried exploiting the fact that
