256312,Transcribing Propositions In English To The Language Of Logic,"The question I am working on is: Let $p$ and$q$ be the propositions $p$:It is below freezing. $q$:It is snowing.
Write these propositions using $p$ and $q$ and logical connectives (including negations). a) It is below freezing and snowing. b)It is below freezing but not snowing. c) It is not below freezing and it is not snowing. d)It is either snowing or below freezing (or both). e) If it is below freezing, it is also snowing. f) Either it is below freezing or it is snowing, but it is
not snowing if it is below freezing. g) That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient
for it to be snowing."" I only actually have a problem with part d). The answer I wrote is $(p \vee q)\vee (p \wedge q)$; but, apparently, the answer is simply $(p \vee q)$.

256330,Compute spectral/projection-valued measures explicitly?,"Spectral/projection-valued measures have very handy applications theoretically, but I got stuck when asked to compute explicitly certain projection-valued measures. Let's focus on the following: Let $ N: {\mathcal{L}^{2}}([0,1]) \to {\mathcal{L}^{2}}([0,1]) $ be the normal operator defined by
  $$
\forall f \in {\mathcal{L}^{2}}([0,1]),\forall t \in [0,1]: \quad [N(f)](t) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} t \cdot f(t).
$$
  What is the projection-valued measure corresponding to $ N $? As $ \sigma(N) = [0,1] $, we need a projection-valued measure $ P $ supported on $ [0,1] $. Theoretically , it should be defined just by
$$
P(E) = {\chi_{E}}(N),
$$
where $ \chi_{E} $ is the characteristic function of $ E \subseteq [0,1] $ and $ {\chi_{E}}(N) $ is obtained via the Borel functional calculus of $ N $. However, to find $ {\chi_{E}}(N) $, we need to find a sequence of polynomial functions converging to $ \chi_{E} $, which is not an easy job. I somehow feel that the projection-valued measure is given simply by $ P(E) = {\chi_{E}}(N) $, but I am not sure. Can someone give a hint on how to compute the spectral/projection-valued measure explicitly?

256393,Calculate Runge-Kutta order 4's order of error experimentally,"The Problem Use the order 4 Runge-Kutta method to solve the differential equation $
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = -g + \beta e^{-y/\alpha }*\left | \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right |^{2}
$ And corroborate that its global error is O (h^4) The Mathematical model I turn the problem into a system of order 1 differential equations: $
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = v 
$ $
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -g + \beta e^{-y/\alpha }*\left | v \right |^{2}
$ Therefore I define the discretization variables u (for position) and v (for speed) as: v = f(v, u, t) u = g(v, t) And use the following increments for the Runge-Kutta method of order 4: For u k1v = h f(vn, un, tn) k2v = h f(vn + 0.5 k1v, un + 0.5 k1u, tn + 0.5 h) k3v = h f(vn + 0.5 k2v, un + 0.5 k2u, tn + 0.5 h) k4v = h f(vn + k3v, un + k3u, tn + h) For v k1u = h f(vn, tn) k2u = h f(vn + 0.5 k1v, tn + 0.5 h) k3u = h f(vn + 0.5 k2v, tn + 0.5 h) k4u = h f(vn + k3v, tn + h) And use them in the RK4 expression for each of them: $
u_{n+1} = u_{n} + \frac{1}{6} (k_{1u} + 2 k_{2u} + 2 k_{3u} + k_{4u})
$ $
v_{n+1} = v_{n} + \frac{1}{6} (k_{1v} + 2 k_{2v} + 2 k_{3v} + k_{4v})
$ NOTE: I first solve for v . To calculate the order of the error, I will solve 120 = h i times with h = 0.1, h = 0.05 and use the result given for h = 0.001 as the ""real"" value, since I don't know the function that solves the ODE. Then I should corroborate that the absolute value of the ""real"" minus the result I got from h = 0.1 must be 16 times bigger than what I get when I substract the value I got from h = 0.05 from the ""real"" value.

256427,Poisson Process with two Lambda,"I am quite stuck here, but well I am trying my best. Question: The Web page of a teacher receives hits from his students according to a poisson process with rate  λ=10 visits/day . Also, his colleagues , are vititng his page with rate 2 visits per/day . 1) What is the probability the visits to exceed 10 in a day? 2) What is the probability no student visits his page into 10 hours interval ? 3) Suppose that every student who visits the site , press the link with teachers publications with chance 2/5. What is the probability into a day that only one student pressed that link? My attempted Solution: 1) To begin with I turn the days into hours , for my convenience. So I assume that λ1= 10/24 and λ2=2/24=1/12 . Since the question is not very clear to me... I think that we just need P((s,s+24))= P((s,s+24))-N(s) >10) =P(N(24)> 10) . here λ=λ1+λ2 = 1/2 .
 But, I am not sure how to continue from this point. Should I take some integral from 10 to inf of e^(-λs) * (λs)^x/x!  dx ? Couldn't also I say that its the probability 1-(p(0)+p(1)+...+p(10) )? Although this might take loads of time . 2) So for this question, λ=10/24 .

256435,Nonexistence of a global coordinate system,"I asked this question in https://mathoverflow.net/ , but was advised to ask it here. So here it is. I just started a self-study of differential geometry and topology. And in several text I came accross the question, asking to show that the global coordinates cannot be defined on a circle $S_{1}$. It seems like quite easy question, but I cannot work the proof. I have a hunch that it has something to do with a Jacobian being zero at some points. Suppose $S_{1}= [(x,y)\in R^{2} | x^{2}+y^{2}=1] $ and there exist a global coordinate system $u=f(x,y)$, $x=g(x,y)$. The Jacobian then is as follows: 
$$  J=\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}  & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}  \\\ 
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}  & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} 
\end{vmatrix}$$
Since $y=\pm \sqrt{1-x^{2}}$ $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=0$$ $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}=0$$
So I have that Jacobian is equal to zero. But this also feels not quite right. I'm I missing something? Comment: the global coordinates means that the mapping is smooth bijective and has a non-zero Jacobian everywhere.",['differential-geometry']

The precise subset of such tuples which corresponds to $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ is given by the usual definition of the inverse limit. There is a canonical injective homomorphism $\eta: \mathbb{Z} \to \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$, such that to each $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds the tuple $\text{(z mod 1, z mod 2, z mod 3, ...)}$. However, it is well known that this homomorphism is not surjective, meaning there exist elements in $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ which do not correspond to anything in $\mathbb{Z}$. Does anyone know how to explicitly construct an example of such an element in $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$, which isn't in the image of the homomorphism $\eta$, and to represent it as a tuple as outlined above?","['ring-theory', 'category-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

$$ Then, I search for function $g(x)$ so that $ 0 \leq f(x) \leq g(x)$ for $(0,1]$ in order to use convergence criteria. Then, I narrow the expresion in the integral to find something bigger, but that it converges. I make the following steps: $$
\frac{||\cos(x) - 1||}{||x^{5/2} + 5x^3||} \leq \frac{2}{||x^{5/2} + 5x^x||} \leq \frac{2}{||x^{5/2}||} \leq \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}

\int _{0}^{1} \frac{\cos \left( x\right) -1} {x^{5 / 2}+5x^{3}}\,dx

$$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{(-1)^k}{(k+1)^2}  = \frac{H_{n+1}}{n+1}.$$
One, by Antonio Vargas, uses a double integral.  The other, by me, uses the absorption identity twice.  I'd like to see a combinatorial proof, but I haven't managed to come up with one yet. Some thoughts so far: Since the right-hand side is clearly not an integer for $n \geq 1$, we may need to interpret the identity as a probability.  I would accept a combinatorial-based probability argument. Alternatively, we could turn both sides into integers by multiplying by $(n+1)!^2$.  The new identity would be $$ \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{(-1)^k (n+1)!^2}{(k+1)^2}  = (n+1)! \, n! \, H_{n+1}.$$  I would accept a combinatorial proof of this version of the identity. We need a combinatorial interpretation of the harmonic numbers.  There are two in this paper by Benjamin, Preston, and Quinn .  The first is that $n! \, H_n$ is the number of permutations on $n+1$ elements that contain exactly two cycles. That implies that $\dfrac{H_n}{n+1}$ (very close to the right-hand side of the identity we want to prove) is the probability that a random permutation on $n+1$ elements contains exactly two cycles.  The second interpretation in the paper is that a random permutation on $n$ elements has, on average, $H_n$ cycles. We likely need inclusion/exclusion to interpret the left-hand side.","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

The notion of retrocompact open subsets is used in the definition of constructible subsets of a scheme which is important in algebraic geometry. Let $X$ be a topological space.
We say a subset $Z$ of $X$ is retrocompact if $Z \cap U$ is quasi-compact for every quasi-compact open subset $U$ of $X$. If $X$ is a separated scheme, every quasi-compact open subset is retrocompact. Suppose $X$ is a locally Noetherian scheme.
Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$.
Let $V$ be a quasi-compact open subset of $X$.
Since $V$ is a Noetherian topological space, $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact.
Hence $U$ is retrocompact. So let us suppose $X$ is a separated scheme which is not locally Noetherian.

Let $D > 1$ be an integer with $\gcd(D, p_i) = 1$ for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq r$, and $Λ$ is an integer, $0 < Λ < D$, such that $\gcd(Λ,D) = 1$. Let $P(D; x; p_1, a_1, b_1; p_2, a_2, b_2; \ldots; p_r, a_r, b_r)$ denote the cardinality of the set
$$\{ n \leq x \mid n \equiv Λ \;(\bmod\; D); n \not\equiv a_i\; (\bmod\; {p_i}) ; n \not\equiv b_i\; (\bmod \;{p_i})\}\,.$$
If $p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_r$ and $p_i > 2$, then
$$P(D;x; p_1,a_1,b_1;\ldots ; p_r;a_r;b_r) > \frac{Cx}{D \ln^2 p_r} - C'p_r^{7.9}$$ where $C$ and $C'$ are positive constants. So, the presence of this theorem somewhat muddies my question. Can things be significantly simplified in my case (where I have a single excluded congruence class modulo each prime, and no other explicit constraints)?",['number-theory']
257166,Why does this covariance matrix have additional symmetry along the anti-diagonals?,"In my self study of a statistics book, I came across a page that has confused me somewhat. I am already familiar with covariance matricies, (or maybe not!), and the author's explanation leaves me a little confused. Here is the page in question: My question is simply, why is that bottom right entry into the covariance equal to 1, when it fact it seems to me that it should be $a^2 + \sigma_n^2$. So, I follow everything he is doing, but the bottom right entry to me, seems wrong. The bottom right entry is $var(z_2)$. Thus, by my estimates: $$
cov(z_2,z_2) = var(z_2) = \mathbb{E}(z_2^2) - (\mathbb{E}(z_2))^2
$$ Thus, (assuming noise is zero mean, but not that I think it makes a difference anyway): $$
\begin{align}
var(z_2) &= \mathbb{E}( (az_1 + n)^2) - 0 \\
&= \mathbb{E}( a^2z_1^2 + 2az_1 + n^2) \\
&= a^2 + \sigma_n^2
\end{align}
$$ (Sorry about the alignment I am not sure how to make the allignment of the equations nice). Anyway, to me that should be the answer to the bottom right entry of the covariance matrix. Am I missing something?","['statistics', 'matrices', 'random-variables']"

  ways to look at this problem
    1. We could  use C's and insert letters that would effectively break up adjacent C's
    2. We could use a string and A's and B's and try to put C's into the string in order to break up the string. Both views will result in the
  number of subwords with the form CC. So we know that we are looking for: $\frac{(n+m+r)!}{n!m!r!}$ −number
  of words with doubles  C′s So we must now formulate how to find the number of double C forms. Using the second approach aforementioned we can construct a word with
  n-A's and m2-B's $n+m\choose m$   ways. In order to appropriately
  account for overlaps and gaps we can expand on the previous form
  resulting in : $n+m+1\choose{r}$⇒
  $\frac{(n+m+1)!}{((r!((n+m+1)−r)!))}$ This effectively  chooses the number of gaps we can insert C into. So we can calculate the number of words created without the subword CC

257271,Two questions on Nagata's counterexample to the Hilbert's fourteenth problem.,"Let $\{a_{ij}\}$ for $i=1,2,3$, and $j=1,...,16$ be algebraically independent elements over some prime field. Let $k$ be a field containing all $a_{ij}$. Then consider $k^{16}$ as $k$-vector space and $U$ be the linear subspace of all vectors orthogonal to the $(a_{i1},...,a_{i16})$. Now let $G\subset GL_{32}(k)$ be the set of transformations of $k[x_1,...,x_{16},t_1,...,t_{16}]$ (the $x_i$ and $t_i$ be indeterminates) that fix $t_i$ for all $i$, and map $x_i$ to $x_i+b_it_i$ for some $(b_1,...,b_{16})\in U$. Claim: $k[x_1,...,x_{16},t_1,...,t_{16}]^G$ is not finitely generated. This is the famous first counterexample to Hilbert's conjecture known as the fourteenth problem (of his 23 published problems). I'm trying to understand the proof that this actually works, and I'm already a little confused with some arguments / steps in the first some sentences. Maybe you can help me out there. We set $u=t_1\cdots t_{16}$, $v_j=u/t_j$, $w_j=v_jx_j$, and finally $y_i=\sum a_{ij}w_j$ for $i=1,2,3$. Of course the $t_i$ are invariant under $G$, and the $y_i$ are also. Now he writes: ""Since $k[w_1,...,w_{16}]=k[y_1,y_2,y_3,w_4,...,w_6]$, we have $$k(x_1,...,x_{16},t_1,...,t_{16})=k(y_1,y_2,y_3,x_4,...,x_{16},t_1,...,t_{16}),$$
and $G$ is the set of linear transformations $\sigma$ of $k[y_1,.y_2,y_3,x_4,...,x_{16},t_1,...,t_{16}]$ such that $\sigma(y_i)=y_i$, $\sigma(t_j)=t_j$ and $\sigma(x_l)=x_l+b_lt_l$ with arbitrary elements $b_4,...,b_{16}$ of $k$."" I don't really get where that ""Since"" is coming from. I can show both equalities, but I'm not really using the first one to show the 2nd one except for that it tells me that $w_1,w_2,w_3$ are in the right hand side. So I think there maybe is a ""direct argument"" other than calculation here to get the 2nd equation. Maybe a ""direct relation"" between those two equations. I thought about taking the quotient field on both sides, but that didn't seem to work for me, either. It also made me think about the way I tried to prove equality of two rings / fields of the form $k[...]=k[,,,]$, or $k(...)=k(,,,)$. For the second type, i.e. in this case the 2nd equation above, I just showed that $x_1,x_2,x_3$ is in the rhs, and that $y_i$ are in the lhs. But that's exactly the same thing I would do were there no round parentheses but []. Am I doing anything wrong here? Edit: To make this more precise, I think what I'm asking here is: Let $f_1,...,f_r,g_1,...,g_s\in k[x_1,...,x_n]$. What would I need to do to show that $k[f_1,...,f_r]=k[g_1,...,g_s]$, and in comparison, what would be needed to have $k(f_1,...,f_r)=k(g_1,...,g_s)$? Is there a fundamental difference between those 2 methods? Also, I don't quite get why we can use arbitrary $b_i$ here now, but I didn't really think about that yet, so I'm gonna do that first and try stuff myself there, too :) Thank you in advance for reading this wall of text, I'm sorry it got so long.","['ring-theory', 'invariant-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

In this competition players are randomly paired and then the winners move on to the next round.  What is the probability that at one point in the competition the brothers face each other?  My professor said my answer was wrong, and provided no explanation.  I was wondering where my logic went wrong? This is the solution I gave. We can look at a smaller part of this problem to help solve the larger problem, the smaller part being what is the probability that two people will face each other in an individual round of of the tournament with $2^n$ players.  This problem can also be expressed as the following, given a random pairing of $2^n$ people which includes two brothers Pat and Steve, what is the probability that the brothers will be in the same pair.  This is given by the number of pairings where Pat and Steve are together divided by the total number of pairings.  Notice that the number possible pairings where Pat and Steve are held constant is the number of pairings for $2n-2$ people.  Thus if we can find some function $f(2n)$ that is defined as the number of ways of pairing $2n$ people, then the ratio $\frac{f(2^n-2)}{f(2^n)}$ will give us the desired probability.  To find this ratio, lets consider how many pairings we add by increasing the number of people we are pairing by two.  When this pair is held together there are $f(2n-2)$ pairings, and if we switch one of the people with a new person there are another $f(2n-2)$ pairings.  If we hold one person constant we can pair him with any of the other $2n-1$ people.  Since by summing these all together we get all of the possible pairings, this is $(2n-1)*f(2n-2)$.  Thus the ratio we were looking for is $\frac{f(2^n-2)}{(2^n-1)*f(2^n-2)} = \frac{1}{2^n-1}$.  The probability that both brothers reach the nth round is $\frac{1}{4^n}$, and since these cases are distinct from when the brothers face each other the probability that the brothers face each other in any of the $n$ rounds is the sum $\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{1}{2^{n-i}-1}*\frac{1}{4^n}$.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

I re-did the problem for what amounted to karma, and got a 4/10. A formal statement of what I'm trying to prove is, given a sequence $x_n$ of real numbers:
    $$\exists\ a > 0 \land c \in (0, 1) : \forall\ n \geq 1, |x_{n+1} - x_n| \leq ac^n \implies \exists\ L : x_n \to L$$ Essentially, we are given a sequence $x_n$ in the real numbers where the difference of consecutive terms $|x_{n+1} - x_n|$ was always less than the appropriate term in some geometric sequence, $ac^n$. We were told to prove that this sequence was pre-convergent, where pre-convergence was defined as:
$$\forall\ \varepsilon > 0, \exists\ N \in \Bbb N : n \geq N \implies |a_n - a_N| < \varepsilon$$
I tackled the problem first by proving that the set of pre-convergent sequences is equivalent to the set of Cauchy sequences (and thus convergent in complete sets). Then, I noted that $\forall\ r \in \Re, 0 \leq |r|$, so I constructed the sequences $z_n = 0$ where the following held:
$$ z_n \leq |x_{n+1}-x_n| \leq ac^n$$
