8186,When do the multiples of two primes span all large enough natural numbers?,"It is well-known that given two primes $p$ and $q$, $pZ + qZ = Z$  where $Z$ stands for all integers.
It seems to me that the set of natural number multiples, i.e. $pN + qN$ also span all natural numbers that are large enough. That is, there exists some $K>0$, such that
$$pN + qN = [K,K+1,...).$$ My question is, given $p$ and $q$, can we get a upper bound on $K$?","['prime-numbers', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
8188,Is there a trick to prove injectivity for maps out of tensor products?,"For a ring $R$, an $R$-right-module $M$, an $R$-left-module $N$, and an abelian group $P$, one can use the universal property of the tensor product to construct maps
$$
M\otimes_R N\to P.
$$
It concrete cases, it is often easy to see that the constructed map is surjective by just writing down pre-images. It seems to be harder to verify that the map is injective, because then one has to consider general sums of elementary tensors in $M\otimes_R N$. Are there any tricks to avoid this, and to achieve injectivity more elegantly? More concretely, an example I have in mind is the following: I have a pre-additive category $C$ with finitely many objects. I consider modules over this category (that is, functors from $C$ to Abelian groups; or, equivalently, modules over the category ring of $C$). Now, I consider the ""free $C$-right-module $Q_Y$ over an object $Y$ in $C$"" which is the hom functor $C(\bullet,Y)$. I want to show that for an arbitrary left-module $M$:
$$
Q_Y\otimes_C M\cong M(Y)
$$
as abelian groups. Using the module structure of $M$, I can accomplish a natural epimorphism $Q_Y\otimes_C M\to M(Y)$ which should be injective. Currently I think that the formula
$$
M(Y)\to Q_Y\otimes_C M;\quad m\mapsto\mathrm{id}_Y\otimes m
$$
gives indeed a (two-sided) inverse. Is this correct?","['tensor-products', 'abstract-algebra']"

8256,Is this analysis problem involving induction flawed?,"I was recently asked to help someone with the following question on their first year analysis course. Recall that  $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all positive integers. Use the principle of induction to show that $n \ge 1$ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N}.$ [ Hint: Let $ S = \lbrace n \in \mathbb{N} | n \ge 1 \rbrace.$ ] I am concerned that the first sentence of the question assumes that we already know exactly what the positive integers are, which renders the rest of the question redundant. I would prefer to see the question written: Recall that $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of $ x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x$ is a member of every inductive set. [ $P$ is an inductive set if (a) $ 1 \in P $ and (b) $ x \in P \Rightarrow x+1 \in P.$ ] Then we can answer as follows: With $S$ as in the hint, by definition $ S \subseteq \mathbb{N}.$ $1 \in S$ since $1 \in \mathbb{N},$ as it is an inductive set.
For $ n \in S, $ $n+1 > n \ge 1,$ therefore $n+1 \in S.$
Hence $S$ is an inductive set, and so  $ \mathbb{N} \subseteq S.$ Therefore $ S=\mathbb{N}.$
Therefore $1$ is the least element of $\mathbb{N}.$ Am I being way too picky, or is the question flawed as it stands?","['induction', 'analysis']"

8273,Adding integers to an infinite continued fraction expansion doesn't change the value?,"I'm learning about continued fractions, and I've enjoyed them so far, but I'm unsure if I've done the following correctly. I have no real experience with analysis, so I'm not sure if my reasoning is formal enough, or correct. Any feedback would be appreciated. Let $\xi$ be an irrational number with continued fraction expansion $\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3\dots\rangle$. Let $b_1,b_2,b_3,\cdots$ be any sequence of positive integers, either finite or infinte. Prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,b_1,b_2,b_3\dots\rangle=\xi$. I let $r_n=\langle a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle$ and $\xi'=\langle b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots\rangle$, and let $\beta_n=\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3\dots,a_n,\xi'\rangle$. So* $$\beta_n-r_n=\beta_n-\frac{h_n}{k_n}=\frac{\xi'h_n+h_{n-1}}{\xi'k_n+k_{n-1}}-\frac{h_n}{k_n}$$
$$=\frac{-(h_nk_{n-1}-h_{n-1}k_n)}{k_n(\xi'k_n+k_{n-1})}=\frac{(-1)^n}{k_n(\xi'k_n+k_{n-1})}$$ But ${k_n}$ is a positive increasing series, $\xi'$ is a positive real number, so as $n$ approaches $\infty$, the denominator goes to $\infty$ while the numerator alternates between $-1$ and $1$, so the fraction tends to $0$. Hence we have that $\lim_{n\to\infty}(\beta_n-r_n)=0$, so $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\beta_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\rangle=\langle a_0,a_1,a_2\dots\rangle=\xi.$$ Hence $\lim_{n\to\infty}\langle a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n,b_1,b_2,b_3\dots\rangle=\xi$. If this the correct route to go? As a small side question, how does it make sense to have integers $b_i$ at the end of this sequence, if the sequence is infinite? Thanks! *If it's not well known, $\{h_n\}$ is the sequence defined by $h_{-2}=0,h_{-1}=1,h_i=a_ih_{i-1}+h_{i-2}$ and $\{k_n\}$ is defined as $k_{-2}=1,k_{-1}=-1, k_i=a_ik_{i-1}+k_{i-2}$, and $r_n=\langle a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle$, for any sequence of integers $a_0,a_1,a_2\dots$ all positive except perhaps $a_0$.","['continued-fractions', 'number-theory']"
8284,Confidence band for Brownian Motion with uniformly distributed hitting position,"Let $(B_t)$ denote the standard Brownian motion on the interval $[0,1]$. For a given confidence level $\alpha \in (0,1)$ a confidence band on $[0,1]$ is any function $u$ with the property that 
$$
P(\omega; |B_t(\omega)| < u(t), \quad \forall t\in [0,1])=\alpha.
$$
In other words, the probability that a path of the Brownian motion stays within a confidence band is $\alpha$. Additionally the boundary hitting position for those paths leaving the band must be uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. This condition can be stated using the stopping time 
$$\tau(\omega) = \inf [ t \in [0,1], |B_t(\omega)|=u(t) ].
$$
Then $\tau $ is the time of the first hitting, and one asks that $\tau$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ conditionally on the event that $\tau$ is finite.

However, to work out $A \cup B \cup C$, I need to know $A \cap B$ (and $A \cap C$ etc).

8290,Upper bound for the quality of an $abc$-triple,"A triple of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ is an $abc$ -triple if $a$ and $b$ are coprime and $c = a + b$ .

One version of the $abc$ -Conjecture is that for each $\varepsilon > 0$ , there are finitely many $abc$ -triples such that $P(a,b,c) > 1 + \varepsilon$ . There are finitely many known triples satisfying $P > 1.4$ , the so called good triples ,  and the largest (quality) is $P(2,3^{10} \cdot 109, 23^{5}) = 1.629911684 \dots$ (discovered by E. Reyssat). This leads me to some questions: Question one: Is there an upper bound for $P(a,b,c)$ simply in terms of $c$ and absolute constants (sharper than $\log_{2} c$ )? Question two: Is there an absolute upper bound for $P(a,b,c)$ so that no triple has higher quality? Best Answer: If there were such a bound, then asymptotic FLT would be in hand.

I don't understand what $\infty$ means here. I don't understand why this is would be the inverse. Heuristically, I see that \begin{equation}

8331,Exercise from Eisenbud & Harris's The Geometry of Schemes,"I've just started learning about schemes, so maybe I'm missing something basic. This is exercise I-24(a): Take Z = Spec$\mathbb{C}[x]$, let $X$ be the result of identifying the two closed points (x) and (x-1) of |Z|, and let $\phi: Z \to X$ be the natural projection. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be $\phi_* \mathcal{O}_Z$, a sheaf of rings on
$X$. Show that $(X, \mathcal{O})$ satisfies condition (i) above for all elements $f \in \mathcal{O}(X) = \mathbb{C}[x]$. The condition (i) referred to: For any $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ define $U_f \subset X$ as the set of points $x \in X$ such that $f$ maps to a unit of the stalk $\mathcal{O}_x$. (i) means that $\mathcal{O}(U_f) = \mathbb{C}[x][f^{-1}]$ for all f. But how can this be? Put f = x. Then $U_f = X \setminus \{(x)\}$ $\phi^{-1}(U_f) = Z \setminus \{ (x), (x-1) \}$ $\mathcal{O}(U_f) = \mathcal{O}_Z(\phi^{-1}(U_f)) = \mathbb{C}[x][ ((x)(x-1))^{-1} ]$. And that is not $\mathbb{C}[x][f^{-1}]$. Edit: Regarding the answer and comments. evgeniamerkulova's answer reassures me that I'm not out of my mind, but obviously Matt E and Mariano know what they're talking about, so I don't know what to think. Both Mariano and Matt E imply that $\mathcal{O}(X)$ is not $\mathbb{C}[x]$, but that seems obviously wrong (and contradicts the book itself). Here's my reasoning, spelled out. O(X) is C[x]. This is because $\mathcal{O}_Z(\phi^{-1}(X)) = \mathcal{O}_Z(Z) = \mathbb{C}[x]$. In order for the condition to be satisfied, we need $\mathcal{O}(U) = \mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}]$ for some open U in X. So we need $\mathcal{O}_Z(\phi^{-1}(U)) = \mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}]$. For that to happen we need $\phi^{-1}(U) = Z \setminus \{ (x) \}$. But all the inverse images of sets in X either include both (x) and (x-1) or neither of them, so this can never happen.",['algebraic-geometry']

8415,Asymptotic difference between a function and its binomial average,"The origin of this question is the identity
$$\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} H_k = 2^n \left(H_n - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k 2^k}\right),$$
where $H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number. Dividing by $2^n$, we have
$$2^{-n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} H_k = H_n - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k 2^k}.$$ The sum on the left can now be interpreted as a weighted average of the harmonic numbers through $H_n$ -- where the weights, of course, are the binomial coefficients.  Thus the difference between $H_n$ and its ""binomial average"" (I'm guessing there's no term for this) is
$$H_n - 2^{-n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} H_k =  \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k 2^k}.$$ The sum on the right is known to converge to $\ln 2$ as $n \to \infty$.  (Substitute $-\frac{1}{2}$ into the Maclaurin series for $\ln (1+x)$.) This leads me to my question: Can we classify nonnegative functions $f(n)$ for which 
  $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(f(n) - 2^{-n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} f(k) \right)$$ is finite and nonzero? It would seem that if $f$ increases sufficiently rapidly, then the limit would be $\infty$.  This is the case with both $f(n) = a^n$ and $f(n) = n$.  If $f$ decreases or is constant, then the limit is zero.  If $f$ has basically logarithmic growth, then it seems the limit would behave as $H_n$.  But can this be proved?  And what about other sublinear, increasing functions?","['average', 'asymptotics', 'binomial-coefficients', 'real-analysis']"

This is a smooth manifold in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and for a given point $s \in S^2$, one can consider its coordinate neighborhood. There are many ways to put a smooth structure on $S^2$, but all require at least two coordinate neighborhoods. One simple way is to make use of the local coordinates $\theta, \phi$ (azimuthal angle and inclination angle). For $s \in U = S^2 \setminus {(0,0,1), (0,0,-1)}$, define a coordinate map by $ g : (0,2\pi) \times (0,\pi) \rightarrow U $ with formula given by $ g(\theta, \phi) = (\sin(\phi) \cos(\theta), \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta), \cos(\phi)) $ This map is one-to-one, onto, and bicontinuous, so it is a homeomorphism. One can construct a similar map onto $V = S^2 \setminus {(1,0,0),(-1,0,0)}$, so the whole sphere is covered. The fact that this defines a differentiable structure is easy to work out.

P_t = (1-\gamma) P_{t-1} + \gamma S(t) 
$$
where $\gamma<1$ limits fast I can move.  Which can be written
$$
\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{\gamma} = - P_{t-1} +S(t)
$$ Sadly, I have a drift towards zero of $-P$, and $S$ has to drive me away from zero, towards $c$.  So $S(t)$ is the ""size"" of my push towards $c$ at date $t$.  The cost of $S$ is given by $$
C(T,S(t)) = \sum_1^{T} (S(t))^2

Clearly, you could set $S(1) =  c / \gamma$, so I arrive immediately, at cost $( c/\gamma )^2$.  So that is an upper bound on the cost.  I could do it in two steps;  If I step $x$ the first period,  I will need to step 
$$\frac{(c-(1-\gamma) \gamma x)}{\gamma}$$
the second period, for a total cost of of
$$
x^2 + (\frac{(c-(1-\gamma) \gamma x)}{\gamma})^2,

which is a lower cost than the one-step option, since $\gamma<1$.

Let $D_{k} = ${ $d$ } be the subset of unitary divisors of an integer $k > 1$ satisfying $\omega(d) = \omega(k) - 1$. Definition . A positive integer $k = p_{1}^{r_{1}} \cdots p_{n}^{r_{n}} > 1$ is hyperbolic if and only if $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_{i}^{-r_{i}} < 1$ or, equivalently, $\sum_{d \in D_{k}} d < k$. See my OEIS entry. For example, $3$, $10$ and $20$ are hyperbolic, but $30$ and $510510 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17$ are not. Assuming my calculations are correct, I'll state the following with some confidence: Indeed, many positive integers are hyperbolic. Of the first $10^{8}$ integers, $70334760$ are hyperbolic. Non-trivial prime powers, squares or higher, are also hyperbolic. If $k$ is a hyperbolic integer, then so are its proper, non-trivial unitary divisors; however, the same cannot be inferred for all divisors (consider the hyperbolic integer $900$ and its non-hyperbolic divisor $30$). In fact, an arbitrary product of any number of non-trivial unitary divisors of a hyperbolic integer is again hyperbolic. The set of hyperbolic integers is closed under exponentiation , but not under addition (e.g., $10 + 20 = 30$) or under multiplication (e.g., $3 \times 10 = 30$). Define the Prime zeta function , $\zeta_{P}(s) = \sum_{p \text{ prime}} p^{-s}$, which converges absolutely for $\mathsf{Re}(s) > 1$. Recall that the multiplicity of a prime divisor $p$ of $k$ is the largest exponent $r$ such that $p^{r}$ divides $k$ but $p^{r+1}$ does not. If the minimum multiplicity of an integer $k$ is $2$ or greater, then $k$ is hyperbolic as can be seen by the elementary bound
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_{i}^{-r_{i}} < \zeta_{P}(2) \approx 0.452247 ....
\end{eqnarray}
Thus, the question of hyperbolicity is non-trivial only for integers with minimum multiplicity $1$. Numerical evidence suggests that the natural density of the hyperbolic integers is greater than $0.988284 \dots$, and I conjecture that almost all integers are indeed hyperbolic (i.e., the natural density is 1).

Its seems like a trivial proof, but I just can't see what I'm missing. What I have so far:
Given $R$ is a ring with $p$ elements and $R$ is an abelian group of prime order, therefore it is cyclically generated, and of characteristic $p$ and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . Essentially it boils down to showing $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is forced to have a multiplicative identity, but I just can't see where this comes from (every resource I found seems to take this as a fact).

That is, $f$ and $F$ are functions such that for all $x$ in $[a, b]$ , $f(x) = F'(x)$ If $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$ then $\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a).$ I've been through the proof a few times. It makes sense to me.  But, it didn't help me to see the light. To me it just looks like ""OK here is how you do the definite integral."" Which doesn't seem like such a big deal, especially when indefinite integrals can be more interesting.","['calculus', 'integration', 'derivatives']"
8654,"Why is the following evaluation of Apery's Constant wrong and do you have suggestions on how, if at all, this method could be improved?","Please let me summarize the method by which L. Euler solved the Basel Problem and how he found the exact value of $\zeta(2n)$ up to $n=13$. Euler used the infinite product $$ 
\displaystyle   f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big(1-\frac{x^2}{n^2\pi^2}\Big) , 
$$ Newton's identities and the (Taylor) Series Expansion (at $x=0$) of the sine function divided by $x$ to arrive at 
$$ 
1 - \frac{x^2}{\pi^2} \cdot (1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + ... + \frac{1}{n^2}) + x^4(...) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{6} + \frac{x^4}{120} - ... 
$$
Upon subtracting 'one' from both sides, equating the $x^2$ terms to each other and multiplying both sides by $ - \pi^2$, one finds that 
$$
\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}.
$$
When I first saw this proof and the way it was extended to find the values of the other even zeta-constants, I couldn't help myself thinking: ""How could this method be strenghtened to find the values of the odd zeta-constants?"" (And, a little while later, ""why hasn't this been done before?"") I started looking for a similar-looking infinite product, only now I focussed on one of the form 
$$ 
\displaystyle   f(x) = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big(1-\frac{x^a}{k^3 \cdot q}\Big) 
$$ 
(for some $ a \in \mathbb{N} , q \in \mathbb{R} $). A little while later I stumbled upon this website and fixated my eyeballs on equation (27). If we take $n=3$, Prudnikov et al. tell us that 
$$ 
\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big(1-\frac{x^3}{k^3}\Big) = - \frac{1}{x^3} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{2} \frac{1}{\Gamma(-e^{2/3 \pi i k} \cdot x)}. 
$$
Now, I thought that if we could use Newton's Identities again on the left side of the equation and find out what the Taylor Series Expansion of the right-hand side would be, we could find out what the exact value of Apery's Constant and other odd zeta-constants would be. In this answer by Robert Smith, I was told the Series Expansion. So we have 
$$ 
1 - x^3(1 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{27} + ... + \frac{1}{n^3}) = -1 - 2 \cdot \gamma x - 2 \gamma^2 x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3(-8\gamma^3 - \psi^{(2)} (1)) - x^4(...)
$$
Notice that on the left side we only have 'one minus a term with an $x^3$ coefficient', while on the other side we see 'minus one plus $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$ coefficients with their terms'. This is important, because it probably answers the question why the following will not work, but I don't know why and I really would like to know. I guess you know what I will attempt to do now. We equate the $x^3$ terms with each other, set $x=1$, multiply by minus one and 'find' that 
$$
\zeta(3) = \frac{1}{6}(8\gamma^3 + \psi^{(2)} (1)). 
$$
By combining this with the already known result 
$$ 
\zeta(3) = -\frac{1}{2} \psi^{2}(1),
$$
we 'find' that 
$$
\zeta(3) '=' \gamma^3.
$$
Obviously, this is wrong. Apery's constant is larger than one, and this value is clearly smaller than one. Could someone please elaborate one where I went wrong? And does anybody have any sugguestions and/or ideas related to the discussion from above using which we could find ""better"" values for Apery's Constant and the other odd zeta constants? (For example by pointing out a similar infinite product relation, and by showing that that infinite product has a nicer Series Expansion?) Or could someone point out to me why this approach to finding nicer closed-form representations for these constants clearly won't lead to any results?

If a ray hits the target, we're done. If the ray hits the boundary and is not close to tangent, ignore it. If the ray hits the boundary approximately tangent, then follow the geodesic on the boundary in that direction, shooting tangent rays off occasionally. 3) (Discretization) Triangulate/tetrahedralize/etc the manifold, and construct a weighted graph where the nodes correspond to the centerpoints of each tetrahedron, the edges correspond to tetrahedra that touch, and the weights correspond to the distance between tetrahedra centers.

I tried verifying that this met the general properties of an interior, and didn't have much trouble showing ${E}^{\circ}\subseteq E$, $(E\cap F)^{\circ}={E}^{\circ}\cap {F}^{\circ}$, and ${X}^{\circ}=X$. However, I don't see how ${{E}^{\circ}}^{\circ}={E}^{\circ}$. I see that ${{E}^{\circ}}^{\circ}\subseteq {E}^{\circ}$, but tried without success to see the other containment. Is there a reason why this follows simply from the axioms of what a metric is? Futhermore, apparently another way to approach this topology is to define the family of open sets $\mathcal{T}$ as those which are the union of a family of balls. Again, I tried verifying this for myself. I see that for any $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, $\cup\mathcal{U}$ is a union of sets which each may be represented as the union of a family of balls, so the whole union again may be represented as the union of a family of balls, namely those in each set in $\mathcal{U}$. Also, $X$ may be represented as the union of balls where I take one ball with center $p$ for all $p\in X$. Finally $\emptyset$ is just an empty union of balls. However, I was unable to show that for finite $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, $\cap\mathcal{U}$ is again open.

My problem is that it does not seem straightforward, at least to me, how to construct the corresponding differential equation for the road, as presented in the paper. Since circles roll on horizontal lines, and equiangular spirals roll on inclined lines, I would suppose that the road needed for a rolling Reuleaux would not be piecewise linear. This demonstrates that the ""road"" cannot be a horizontal line for a Reuleaux triangle, as the axle does not remain level when the curve is rolling. So, how does one construct the road?
