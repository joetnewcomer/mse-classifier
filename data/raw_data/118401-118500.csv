1759109,Is the 2011th term odd for this sequence and why so?,"$a_n = a_{n-1} \cdot a_{n-2} + n$, $n\ge2$, $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 1$.
Is $a_{2011}$ odd. Why so? This is not a homework problem. I am appearing for an exam soon and I am solving sample questions for the exam. I don't know how to go ahead solving this. So far I found out $a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ and $a_7$ but could not spot any pattern. $a_{2011} = a_{2010} \cdot a_{2009} + 2011~$. So I am adding an odd number with the product, so whether or not the number is odd depends entirely on the product. This is as far as I could think.","['number-theory', 'arithmetic']"
1759124,Finding the Limit of a Sequence (No L'Hopital's Rule),"Okay, I feel almost silly for asking this, but I've been on it for a good hour and a half. I need to find:
$$\lim_{n \to\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)^{n}$$
But I just can't seem to figure it out. I know its pretty easy using L'Hopital's rule, and I can ""see"", that it's going to be $1$, but apparently it's possible to compute using only the results I've proved so far. That is, the sandwich theorem, the addition/subtraction/multiplication/division/constant multiple limit laws and the following standard limits:
$\displaystyle\lim_{n \to\infty}\left(n^{\frac{1}{n}}\right)=1$
$\displaystyle\lim_{n \to\infty}\left(c^{\frac{1}{n}}\right)=1$, where $c$ is a real number, and
$\displaystyle\lim_{n \to\infty}\left(1+\frac{a}{n}\right)^{n}=e^{a}$.
As well as those formed from the ratio of terms in the following hierarchy:
$$1<\log_e(n)<n^{p}<a^{n}<b^{n}<n!<n^{n}$$
Where $p>0$ and $1<a<b$ e.g. $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to\infty}\left(\frac{\log_e(n)}{n!}\right)=0$ At first I thought maybe I could express the limit in the form of the $e^{a}$ standard limit, but I couldn't seem to get rid of the square on $n$. I've also tried the sandwich theorem, it's obviously bounded above by $1$, but I just couldn't find any suitable lower bounds. I'd really appreciate some help, or even just a little hint, thanks!","['sequences-and-series', 'limits-without-lhopital']"

1759167,Why do we need the $S \otimes L^{1/2}$ bundle product to determine a $Spin_c$ structure?,"I am reading Marino's book on topological field theory and 4-manifolds and I am very confused in the construction of the $Spin_c$ structures for manifolds that do not admit a $Spin$ structure. In the following all manifolds are 4 dimensional. I will assume I understand that manifolds where the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2 \neq 0$ do not admit a $Spin$ structure (although not clear to me). Let us consider therefore such a 4-manifold. In order to construct something like a $Spin$ structure we need the ""square root"" of a line bundle $L$ which apparently does not exist (or is not well-defined). Question 1: If $w_2=0$ is it well defined? Why do we only care about $L^{1/2}$ now? Additionally the spinor bundle $S$ is also not globally defined (and I assume this has to do with $\pm 1$ ambiguities. Question 2: Am I right? Is there a nice example where going from one chart to another $S$ (or sections of it) changes signs? But then, magically, the structure $S \otimes L^{1/2}$ is well defined (because negative signs cancel to each other naively). So now we have this $Spin_c$ structure. Question 3:What do sections of this spin bundle look now? In the case of spin manifolds we only had the spin bundle $S=S_+ \oplus S_{-}$. What is the case now? I would really like to understand what section of this bundle look like. Finally this yields the final question which is Question 4: How is the above related to the fact that $Spin_c(n) = Spin(n) \times U(1)?$","['spin-geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

Now, I'm trying to write $g$ as a piecewise function, and I'd like to know if this is correct, based on how $g(t)$ is written as a sum of unit step functions: $g(t) = \begin{cases} 0 &\mbox{if } t \lt 2 \\

1759403,Proof of algebraic set involving dimension,"I need some help to understand the following proof. Let $k$ a field and $V$ an algebraic set. I note $\mathfrak{m}_P$ the ideal generated by $X_1-a_1,\dots ,X_n-a_n$ in $k[V]=k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]/I(V)$ with $P=(a_1,\dots ,a_n)$. Theorem. $\left\lbrace P\in V\mid \dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}_P} \big/ _{\mathfrak{m}_P^2} > \min\limits_{P\in V}\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}_P} \big/ _{\mathfrak{m}_P^2}\right\rbrace$ is a algebraic subset of $V$. I will first give you the exact proof that I am studying and then tell you what I don't understand. Proof : Let $f_1,\dots ,f_r$ be generators of $I(V)$. If $(0,\dots ,0)\in V$ and $\mathfrak{m}= \left< X_1,\dots , X_n \right>\subset k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$ we want to calculate
$$\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}} \big/ _{\left<\mathfrak{m}^2,I(V)\right>} = \dim_k ~^{\mathrm{Span}(X_1,\dots ,X_n)} \big/ _{\left<\overline{f_i}~;~1\leq i \leq r\right>} . $$ If 
$$f_i(X_1,\dots ,X_n) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j}X_j + \underbrace{\sum a_{i,j_1,j_2}X_{j_1}X_{j_2}}_{=0 \text{ modulo }\mathfrak{m}^2}$$
The vector subspace $\left< \overline{f_i}~;~1\leq i \leq r\right>$ is generated by $(a_{i,1},\dots ,a_{i,n})=\mathrm{grad} f_i (0,\dots ,0)$ with $1\leq i \leq r$.
$$\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}_0(V)} \big/ _{\mathfrak{m}_0^2(V)} = \dim_k ~^{\mathrm{Span}(X_1,\dots ,X_n)} \big/ _{\mathrm{Span}~\mathrm{grad} f_i}  $$
We will consider $P=(t_1,\dots ,t_n)\in V$ using a translation. The coefficients $a_{i,j}=P_{i,j}(t_1,\dots ,t_n)\in k[t_1,\dots , t_n]$. $$\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}_P} \big/ _{\mathfrak{m}_P^2} = n -\text{rank}(P_{i,j}(t_1,\dots ,t_n)).$$
And $\text{rank}(P_{i,j}(t_1,\dots ,t_n))$ is not maximal is an algebraic subset. End of the proof. I would say that I'm not really understanding much in this. For example why considered $\mathfrak{m}$ in $k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$ are we not supposed to work on $k[V]$ ? Is the vector subspace $\left< \overline{f_i}~;~1\leq i \leq r\right>$ is generated by $(a_{i,1},\dots ,a_{i,n})=\mathrm{grad} f_i (0,\dots ,0)$ with $1\leq i \leq r$ in $\mathrm{Span}(X_1,\dots ,X_n)$ ? Why the dimension $\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}} \big/ _{\left<\mathfrak{m}^2,I(V)\right>}$ with $\mathfrak{m}$ ideal of $k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$ is equal to $\dim_k ~^{\mathfrak{m}_0(V)} \big/ _{\mathfrak{m}_0^2(V)} $ with ideals of $k[V]$ ?

Then the total integral around the path is $0$ and I can calculate the limits as $\rho_1,\rho_2\to0$ and $R\to\infty$ using the known formulas/theorems. However, this leaves me with $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}dx$, instead of $0$ to $\infty$. And the function is not even so I can't just take half of the whole integral.

(To see these options are in fact possible, consider $A=(0,1) \times \{ 0\}$ and $A=\mathbb{R} \times \{0\}$). Update: It says here * that the Jordan Brouwer separation theorem implies that a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ disconnects the space into two connected components. So, we need only to consider the case where $A$ is not closed in $\mathbb{R}^2$. *Here is an explanation, following Stefan Hamcke's comment: Consider the homeomorphism $h:\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \to A$. We can view $h$ as a map $\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Since $A$ is closed (by assumption) $h$ is a closed map. A closed map having the property that the pre-image of every point is compact is proper ( Proof ). The requirement on pre-images is satisfied here trivially, since $h$ is injective. As a proper map, $h$ extends to the one-point compactifications, so we can view it as an embedding $h:\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{S}^{n}$. Thus, theorem 2B.1 (Hatcher, Algebraic Topology) implies $\mathbb{S}^{n} \setminus h(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$ has two connected components, which in turn implies $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus A$ have two components.","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

1759761,Probability with n dice,"I'm studying probability and am currently stuck on this question: Let's say we have n distinct dice, each of which is fair and 6-sided. If all of these dice are rolled, what is the probability that there is at least one pair that sums up to 7?

So Pr(one pair doesn't add up to 7) = 5/6. But then I'm stuck on how to proceed.

My thinking is that the first die can show any number (probability = 1), then the second thru last die must show the same number (probability = 1/6) Case 2: Probability(all n die show exactly two numbers that don't add up to 7) = $1*(\frac{4}{6})*(\frac{2}{6})^{n-2}$? My thinking here is that the first die can show any number, the second die must show any of the 4 other numbers such that the first two die won't add up to 7, and then all other die must show either the first or the second die's number. Case 3: Probability(all n die show exactly three numbers that don't add up to 7) = $1 * \frac{4}{6} * \frac{1}{6} * (\frac{3}{6})^{n-3}$? And then do we just add all of the 3 cases together, then subtract from 1? I might be way off here...","['combinatorics', 'probability']"

Differentiating the constraint twice yields the familiar $$\mathbf{\ddot{r}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}=-\frac{v^2}{r}$$ And taking the dot product of the EL equations with $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and substituting yields $$-\frac{v^2}{r^2}=\lambda(t)$$ Substituting this back into the original equation for $\lambda(t)$, we find that $$\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=-\frac{v^2}{r}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$$ This allows an infinite number of geodesics, but choosing the parameterization that leaves v constant, this simplifies to $$\mathbf{\ddot{r}}=-\mathbf{r}$$ which can be solved for the Cartesian coordinates: $$\begin{matrix}
	x=C_1 \sin (t)+C_2 \cos (t) \\
	y=C_2 \sin (t)+C_4 \cos (t) \\
	z=C_3 \sin (t)+C_6 \cos (t) \\

Given a function $g:\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow\mathbb{Q}$, I understand that $g(n)=g\circ n$, where $n:\mathbb{1}\longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$ denotes the element $n$, and that this shows $g(n)$ is indeed an element of $\mathbb{Q}.$ Can someone help me understand this?

This seems strangely worded. The conditions on the space for van Kampen are that it is the union of path-connected open sets $A_\alpha$, each contains the basepoint, each intersection $A_\alpha\cap A_\beta$ is path-connected, each intersection $A_\alpha\cap A_\beta\cap A_\gamma$ is path-connected; then it follows that the the kernel of $\Phi$ is the normal subgroup $N$ generated by all elements of the form $i_{\alpha\beta}(\omega)i_{\beta\alpha}(\omega)^{-1}$
for $\omega\in\pi_1(A_\alpha\cap A_\beta)$, and hence $\Phi$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_1(X)\cong \ast_\alpha\pi_1(A_\alpha)/N$. (I fix a basepoint for the rest of this question, all wedge sums are identified at this basepoint.) Back to wedge sums. If we are looking at the wedge sum $\bigvee_\alpha A_\alpha$ where each $A_\alpha$ is path connected, then these conditions are obviously true. And since the intersection of any $A_\alpha$ is trivial, the fundamental group of the wedge sum is the free product of the groups. The only problem that I can see arising is when $A_\alpha$ is not path connected. The fundamental group of a disconnected space $X\cup Y$ is $\pi_1(X)$ where the basepoint falls in $X$ (correct me if I am wrong, maybe I have over-simplified this). What is the fundamental group of this wedge sum, then? I would guess that it is $$\ast_\alpha\pi_1(A_\alpha^\prime),$$
where $A_\alpha^\prime$ is the component of $A_\alpha$ containing the basepoint.  If so, then surely $\pi_1(A_\alpha)=\pi_1(A_\alpha^\prime)$, and there is no problem after all, the fundamental group is just the free product of each fundamental group. Is this correct (the fundamental group is always $\pi_1(\bigvee A_\alpha)=\ast\pi_1(A_\alpha)$)? The simple example I scrawled on my piece of paper is below. I figure the fundamental group is
$$\pi_1(\mathsf{Green}\vee\mathsf{Blue}\vee\mathsf{Red})=\Bbb{Z}\ast\Bbb{Z}\ast C_1=\Bbb{Z}\ast\Bbb{Z},$$
which makes sense, no loop at the basepoint can be in the leftmost or rightmost components, they must be (homotopic to a loop) in the figure eight graph. P.S. a side question, why do we use \vee for the wedge sum rather than \wedge ? Thanks in advance :-)","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"

1760270,"Closed-form of an integral involving a Jacobi theta function, $\int\limits_0^\infty \frac{\theta_4^{n}\left(e^{-\pi x}\right)}{1+x^2} dx$","The Jacobi theta function $\theta_4$ is defined by $$\displaystyle \theta_4(q)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n q^{n^2} \tag{1}$$ For this question, set $q=\large e^{-\pi x}$ and $\theta_4 \equiv \theta_4(q)$ . Define $\theta_3(q)=\theta_4(-q)$ . Using Lambert-Series representation for powers of $\theta_4$ (which I will describe in a moment) and integrating term by term, I have obtained a family of neat identities: $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^2}{1+x^2} dx=1 \tag{2}$$ $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^4}{1+x^2} dx=\frac{4 \ln2}{\pi} \tag{3}$$ $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^6}{1+x^2} dx=\frac{16 G}{\pi^2}-\frac23 \tag{4}$$ $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^8}{1+x^2} dx=\frac{20 \zeta(3)}{\pi^3} \tag{5}$$ Here, $G$ is Catalan's constant. These identities check out to a lot of digits, according to Mathematica . As I mentioned, in order to drive these identities I used Lambert series representations for powers of $\theta_4$ which I have found online. For instance: $$\theta_4^2 = 1+4\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n q^n}{1+q^{2n}} \tag{6}$$ (See e.g. [1], or use $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d \mid n} \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} d)$ ([2]), and switch order of summation) $$\theta_4^6=1+16\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n n^2 q^n}{1+q^{2n}}+4\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (2n+1)^2 q^{2n+1}}{1+q^{2n+1}} \tag{7}$$ (A proof is given in [3], together with proofs for similar formulas for the $4$ th power of $\theta_4$ , and the $8$ th power.) I am interested in a closed form for the integral $$I(n)= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4(e^{-\pi x})^n}{1+x^2} dx.\tag{8}$$ 1st Question I have searched the web for a similar Lambert series combination for $\theta_4^{10}$ , but all my efforts remain fruitless.
Also, I wasn't able to derive one using the approach taken in [3].
Can we find a formula, possibly in the form of $(6)$ or $(7)$ , for $\theta_4^{10}(q)$ ?
Such a formula may be used to find the closed form of $I(10)$ . 2nd Question Can we find closed forms for $I(n)$ for other values of $n$ ? In general, can we find a Lambert series representation of $\theta_4^n$ for each even $n$ ? If not, for which $n$ we can find one and for which we cannot?

For more information about how I obtained these results, check the original version of this post. $\displaystyle \large \mathbf{Progress}\,\mathbf{Report}$ Thanks to Paramanand Singh (see his answer below) I've been able to make some progress. Again, we set $q=e^{-\pi x}$ and $$\theta_2 \equiv \theta_2(q)= \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} q^{(n+\frac12)^2}\\\theta_3\equiv \theta_3(q)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} q^{n^2}\\\theta_4\equiv \theta_4(q)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}(-1)^n q^{n^2}$$ We also have the relations $$
\theta_2^4+\theta_4^4=\theta_3^4
\\ \theta_2(e^{-\pi/x})=\frac1{\sqrt{x}}\theta_4(e^{-\pi x})
\\ \theta_3(e^{-\pi/x})=\frac1{\sqrt{x}}\theta_3(e^{-\pi x})\tag{9}
$$ I will omit all the intermediate steps and just state what I've found so far, and also some other related identities which I've
not proven, but match numerically.
So, using Singh's formulas (changing $q$ to $-q$ and rewriting in terms of hyperbolic functions), I get that $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^{10}}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{768 \beta(4)}{5 \pi^4}-\frac{32}{75}-2\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^6}{1+x^2}dx\tag{10}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_4^{12}}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{450 \zeta(5)}{\pi^5}-\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx\tag{11}$$ Notice that $(10)$ and $(11)$ are a bit different from the expressions I wrote in the comments on Singh's answer.
Numerical evidence suggests that: $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx=\frac23\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^4 dx\tag{12}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_3^4\theta_4^2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac83\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^2\theta_3^4\theta_4^4 dx\tag{13}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^4\theta_4^2dx=\int_0^{\infty} \theta_2^2\theta_4^2dx=1\tag{14}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^4}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{8\zeta(3)}{\pi^3}\tag{15}$$ $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\theta_2^4\theta_4^2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac23\tag{16}$$ All of these just make me more confident that an ultimate closed form for both $(10)$ , $(11)$ and higher power combinations of theta functions exist.
As a side note, these integrals identities can be translated into identities about lattice sums, by expanding the theta functions into their series definition.","['theta-functions', 'closed-form', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'sequences-and-series']"

The Euclidean case is classical, well-known and easy to find proofs for. The spherical case is also well-known, and normally described in the same terms (see, for example, the Wikipedia article List of spherical symmetry groups ). But it seems rather more difficult to find a place where the same ideas for the hyperbolic plane are described in the same way (although I'm sure this has been done), as rotations, translations, reflections, and possibly glide reflections, acting on some sort of fundamental region, as seen in Wikipedia's article on the wallpaper groups , for example. There are several ways of approaching hyperbolic symmetries, including groups of reflections in the sides of $(l,m,n)$ hyperbolic triangles with $1/l+1/m+1/n<1$, (see e.g. Wikipedia's article ), or tessellations of $p$-sided polygons, $q$ of which meet at each vertex, with $(p-2)(q-2)>4$; presumably each hyperbolic wallpaper group appears as a symmetry group of one of these tessellations, and is a subgroup of some triangle group; is there a reference that demonstrates this?","['geometric-group-theory', 'reference-request', 'group-theory', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"

Prove that $A \cup B = A \cap B$ if and only if $A=B$. My method was: We must prove two implications, so we will proceed by proving the first implication. We will do this by proving the contrapositive: If $A \neq B$, then $A \cup B \neq A\cap B$. So, we assume that $A \neq B$. Let $k \in A$ and $k \notin B$. Then $k$ is in $A \cup B$ and not $A \cap B$, and $A \cup B \neq A \cap B$. Therefore this is true by definition. Since $A = B$, for every $k \in A$, $k$ is also in $B$. Hence $A \cup B = A=B$ and $A \cap B = A=B$. Therefore, $A \cup B = A \cap B$.

1760366,Winning All Levels in a Game,"There are $L$ levels in a game. In each turn of the game, you go through each level one by one and try to complete it. The goal is to complete all levels of the game. The probability of completing any one of the $L$ levels in  a single turn is $p$. If you complete a particular level at a previous turn then that progress is saved and you don't have to complete it in any successive turns. Even if you fail to complete any level at a particular turn, then the turn continues with the other levels(you don't go to a new turn). So in each turn, you try all the $L$ levels. On average, how many turns do you have to play the game to complete all the levels? This was my approach. Let $N_k$ be the average number of turns you need to play the game in order to complete any $k$ of those $L$ levels($0\le$ $k$ $\le$ $L$). I write the following recurrence relation(from which I can easily calculate $N_L$, the desired answer, since $N_0=0$). $(N_k+1)[1-(1-p)^{L-k}]+(N_{k+1}+1)(1-p)^{L-k}=N_{k+1}$ This is because if you win any one of the remaining $L-k$ levels in the next turn, you have taken $N_k+1$ turns to complete $k+1$ levels and if you lose all, you need $N_{k+1}+1$ turns to complete $k+1$ levels.

Automorphisms of $\mathbb{D}$ preserve this metric. I'm looking to prove the converse, that is, if $f \colon \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D}$ preserves $d$ then it is a biholomorphism from $\mathbb{D}$ to itself, or $\overline{f}$ is. If $f$ is assumed $C^1$ it is mostly not so hard - you can get that at every point either $f$ is holomorphic or its conjugate is by considering $\psi_{f(0)} \circ f$, which preserves the origin and must also preserve the ordinary absolute value, hence is isotropic hence either $f$ or $\overline{f}$ is holomorphic at the origin, and since $f$ was arbitrary this is true of all points. (And hopefully this gives that one of them is globally holomorphic! But I haven't figured out that part yet.) If nothing is assumed of $f$, is the result even true?

This is very much a soft question, but after seeing Cauchy's integral formula in lecture today I was really struck by how neat complex analysis is.

When I asked my professor about this, he said it was a function of the complementary relationship between complex analysis and algebraic topology and didn't really expand on that. Even not knowing much algebraic topology, this connection does seem clear in some ways (the importance of simple connectedness for Cauchy's theorem and dealing with so many paths/using code words for homotopy). However, I am still not sure what it is about the complex plane that lends itself to this special link, especially when it comes to functions. $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is topologically equivalent (maybe just point set topology questions?) from what I understand and it definitely isn't as nice.

1760575,Correspondence between vector bundles and locally free sheaves,"I am trying to look at smooth manifolds in the context of locally ringed spaces. Vector bundles have a characterization in terms of sheaves of modules: if $X, \mathcal{O}_X$ is a topological (or smooth) manifold along with its structure sheaf, then a locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$ module of rank $n$ is the same thing as a vector bundle over $X$ of rank $n$. You can read about the correspondence in Ramanan chapter 2, for instance. Now forget about manifolds for a second, and suppose that $X, \mathcal{O}_X$ is just a locally ringed space, where all the stalks have residue field $\mathbb{R}$, and that $\mathcal{E}$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$ module, and suppose I try to form a vector bundle out of it, in the same way mentioned in the link above. My Question: Given a locally ringed space $X, \mathcal{O}_X$, where each stalk has residue field $\mathbb{R}$, and an $\mathcal{O}_X$ module
  $\mathcal{E}$ which is locally free of rank $n$, how can I construct a
  vector bundle from this information? Here is my attempt, and you can see where I run into problems. Attempt 1: (Via a basis) I'm trying to define a topology, so I may as well work locally. After passing to a smaller open set, I can assume that $\mathcal{E}\cong (\mathcal{O}_X)^n$ as $\mathcal{O}_X$ modules. (Then later I should worry about transition functions and stuff, but you'll see I don't even get that far.) As a set, my vector bundle $E$ will be the elements $\bigcup\limits_{x\in U} (\mathcal{E}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{E}_x)$, where $\mathfrak{m}_x \triangleleft \mathcal{O}_{X, x}$ is the maximal ideal. Now I topologize it by taking a basis for $\mathcal{E}$: suppose $\mathcal{E}(X)$ has a basis over $\mathcal{O}_X(X)$ given by $\mu^1, \dotsc, \mu^n$, and suppose I take as my basis for each $\mathcal{E}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{E}_x$ the images of $\mu^1_x, \dotsc, \mu^n_x \in \mathcal{E}_x$. Now I have specified a bijection  $a: U \times \mathbb{R}^n \to E$, and I can thereby put a topology on $E$, by declaring this to be a homeomorphism. (If I want to define a smooth structure on $E$, I can declare this to be a diffeomorphism.) Is this topology the same if I select a different basis? If I choose $\nu^i$ as a basis, then $\nu^i = \sum_j f^{ij} \mu^j$ for $f^{ij} \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$. I ask myself whether the map 
$$\mu_x \mapsto \sum_j \overline{f}^{ij}_x \mu_x$$
defines a self-homeomorphism from $E \to E$. (Here $\overline{f}^{ij}_x$ represents the image of $f^{ij}_x$ in $\mathcal{E}_x / \mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{E}_x$.) In the case where $X$ is a manifold, and $\mathcal{O}_X$ is its sheaf of continuous (smooth) real-valued functions, then the $f^{ij}$ really are continuous (smooth) real-valued functions on $X$, and the above map $E \to E$ seems pretty clearly to be continuous (smooth). But in the general case, where $X, \mathcal{O}_X$ is just a locally ringed space, I don't really know how to interpret the above map. (Why is it continuous on the topology I've defined? I can define values for $f^{ij}$ in each $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}/\mathfrak{m}_x$, but what do they really have to do with each other?) What I suspect is going wrong: The spaces $\mathcal{E}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x \mathcal{E}_x$ at each point are all isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but they don't have any canonical isomorphisms between them. To put a topology on $E$ I have to kind of decide on these canonical isomorphisms, and I can't just do it in any old way I want--the elements in the structure sheaf
  have to have something to do with continuous functions $X \to \mathbb{R}$ for this
  to work. Attempt 2: (Basis free) (Suggested by a friend): ( Edit: I don't think this works. As Eric Wofsey points out, the fibers would all be discrete.) Take $\mathcal{E}$, and form its etale space $\operatorname{Et}(\mathcal{E})$. The elements of the etale space are just all the germs. Let me describe a relation on germs by saying that two germs $\mu_x, \nu_x$ are related if they are in the same stalk and $\mu_x - \nu_x \in \mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{E}_x$. Now just form the quotient topology by this relation. If I do this in the case where $X, \mathcal{O}_X$ is a manifold with its ring of smooth functions, it seems to give me the correct topology on $X \times \mathbb{R}^n$. So perhaps it works as a basis-free construction?

1760767,Having trouble deriving the symbols used in a quadratric approximation problem.,"I'm refreshing my calculus by studying MIT OCW's Single Variable Calculus course online. The problem is 2A-11, part of Unit 2 ""Applications of Derivatives"". It's a problem dealing with quadratic approximation. I'm understanding the concepts again fairly well and enjoying it, but sometimes things are glossed over in the solutions manual. The problem is stated thus: 2A-11 For an ideal gas at constant temperature, the variables $p$ (pressure) and $v$ (volume) are related by the equation ${pv}^k = C$, where $k$ and $C$ are constants. If the volume is changed slightly from $\,v{}_0$ to  $\,v{}_0+\overrightarrow{D\,}v$, what quadratic approximation expressing p in terms of $\,\overrightarrow{D\,}v\,$ would you use? $\big(\text{Find the approximation valid for }\,\overrightarrow{D\,}v \approx0.\big)$ I started on it, but hit a wall, so I caved in and peeked at the answer... $${pv}^{\hspace{0.1ex}k} = c \quad\implies\quad p = {cv}^{-k}
\\
\begin{aligned}
p &= {cv}^{-k}
%\\ &
=
\big(v{}_0+\Delta v\big)^{-k}

\end{aligned}$$ My question is : How does the $\dfrac{\Delta v}{v{}_0}$ make its way into that approximation as the ""$?$"" in ""$f(?)$""? In other words, when they state things like ""when $x \approx 0$"" , they are relating that to ""$f(x)$"".
But somehow here, we have a $v{}_0$ in the denominator, and $\dfrac{\Delta v}{v{}_0}$ as a whole is taking the place of ""$x$"". For reminder, the quadratic approximation is thus: $$f(x) \approx f\left(x{}_0\right) + f'\left(x{}_0\right)\hspace{0.125ex}\left(x-x{}_0\right) + \dfrac{f''\left(x{}_0\right)}{2}\,{\left(x-x{}_0\right)}^2$$ So at $\,x_0 \approx 0$, it's: $$f\left(x\right) \approx f\left(0\right) + f'\left(0\right)\,x + \dfrac{f''\left(0\right)}{2}\,x^2$$ Anyway, I see where it originated in the previous step in the answer by a refactoring of $v{}_0$, but I am hitting a wall trying to connect the two parts, and wasn't able to reach the answer myself.

1760770,"If $p_n$ is the $n^{th}$ prime, is it ever appropriate to speak of $p_{\aleph_0}$?","If $p_n$ is the $n^{th}$ prime, is it ever appropriate to speak of $p_{\aleph_0}$? I'm no math student.  Your pardon if this is just some clearly obvious and easy answer, I'm just not seeing it. When talking about a function such as $p_n$, where $p_n$ is the $n^{th}$ prime, and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, is it ever appropriate to talk of $p_{\aleph_0}$, since $\left|\mathbb{N}\right| = \aleph_0$? Further is there any proof that $p_n \in \mathbb{N}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$?  The point isn't so much in using primes, they are merely convenient. My basic issue points to a fact discussed in this question, A ""number"" with an infinite number of digits is a natural number? , which states, ""By definition, a natural number has a finite number of digits..."" While it may not be as easily seen with base-10 numbers, I could easily construct a numbering system based on the primes themselves, such that each digit is mulitipled by $p_{digit}$, so that $p_n$ is always 1 followed by (n-1) zeros.  This numbering system, just to help see it, demonstrates that while $\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite set comprised of numbers with a finite number of digits, $\mathbb{P}$, constructed over the same range, grows one digit in length each time and so has one number of each count of digits, from 1 to $\aleph_0$, and thus would contain many numbers with an infinite number of digits.  But, I believe the numbering system is irrelevant, and just illustrates the point.  The real point is that over the range of $\mathbb{N}$, it seems like $p_n$ itself must become infinite in length, and thus no longer be in $\mathbb{N}$ (which, of course, makes no intuitive sense, that a prime not be an integer). What it seems like, thinking about it, I relate to the percentage of primes.  If one looks at the entire number line, there are effectively 0% primes across the whole of the number line, out to infinity.  Out at infinity, you have to go an appropriate ""infinite distance"" to find the next suitable prime, on average, which leaves you with a non-finite number of digits on your next $p_n$.  But, this is arrived at through an infinite set of finite-lengthed $n \in \mathbb{N}$. And, here's what I'm trying to wrap my head around.  This fact seems to indicate that you would run out of primes before you would natural numbers, except you can keep picking primes.  But, according to the illustration given above, $p_{\aleph_0} \notin \mathbb{N}$, or so it seems.. It seems I'm running into somekind of logical falacy here.  Is it just wrong to think of $p_{\aleph_0}$, which of needs must be of infinite length, and hence is not natural, or something else?

Professors will typically in their wording, refer to taking limits or derivatives approaching from the left or the right of some point. But left and right has no meaning in Mathematics. While it may make a visual connection, it is fundamentally wrong, a fallacy. When talking about proving the existence of a limit, using two one-sided limits typical professor would say : A limit as $x$ approaches some number $a$ exists if and only if, the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is equivalent to the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right Stated Mathematically :$$\left(\lim_{x \ \to\  a} f(x) = L\right) \Leftrightarrow \left(\lim_{x \ \to \ a^+} f(x) = L\right) \land \left(\lim_{x \ \to \ a^-} f(x) = L\right)$$ Defined (Fairly) Rigorously Using $\epsilon-\delta$ : $$\left(\forall \epsilon > 0\  (\exists\ \delta > 0 : 0 <|x-a|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon)\right) \Leftrightarrow \left[(\forall \epsilon > 0\  (\exists\ \delta > 0 : a-\delta <x<a \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon) \land (\forall \epsilon > 0\  (\exists\ \delta > 0 : a <x<a +\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon)\right]$$ Question : Is this a more rigorous definition of what professors are talking about when they say ""approaching from the left/right"" .

Possible Answer : Approaching from the left : Taking a sequence of elements as they increase and converge towards an arbitrary element $x$ which is the element acting as the limiting point in the domain $D$ (an ordered set) of $f$. Approaching from the right : Taking a sequence of elements as they decrease and converge towards an arbitrary element $x$ which is the element acting as the limiting point in the domain $D$ (an ordered set) of $f$. Is what I've written above correct? If not, then there has to be a deeper more rigorous definition of approaching some number from the left/right .
