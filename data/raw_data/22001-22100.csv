187922,"The nonexistence of the Collatz-""1-cycle"" by an elementary proof - am I missing something?","The so-called ""1-cycle"" in the Collatz-problem was already disproved by Ray Steiner 1977. However, he used transcendental number theory to achieve that, and Lagarias commented, it is surprising that such heavy weapons are needed for such a tiny result. I think I have an elementary proof now but usually in the Collatz-problem your proofs are faulty, so I better ask for a crosscheck.
As proposed in the MSE.meta I'll put the problem-description in this question and post my attempted proof in an own answer. The notion of 1-cycles begin with the definition of increasing steps $a_{k+1} = {3a_k +1\over 2} $ if $a_k$ is odd and decreasing steps $a_{k+1} = {a_k\over 2} $ if $a_k$ is even. If we consider the simple type of a cycle, which occurs if $N$ increasing steps are followed by $B$ decreasing steps, then let us call this with Steiner, Simons, de Weger and others the ""1-cycle"" of length $S=N+B$ . Notes: 1) here the $N$ contains the number of increasing steps and defines, that the term $3^N$ will become involved. It is my main varying parameter. 2) Depending on $N$ , there is $S$ such that $2^S \gt 3^N \gt 2^{S-1}$ so in fact $S$ is a function of $N$ , and can also be determined by $S(N)=\lceil N \log(3)/\log(2) \rceil$ . I used the symbol $S$ here to indicate it is the sum of the exponents of all powers of $2$ which are involved and also the shorter form $S$ instead $S(N)$ . 3) I introduce also the short-name for the difference $B = S-N$ , thus also depending on $N$ . $B$ is simply the number of purely decreasing steps after the $N$ purely increasing steps. With Steiner, we can state, that an initial number a which we wish to increase by N steps must have the form $a = 2^N \cdot k -1$ ; here we can use any odd integer $k \gt 0$ . The result of that transformation, let's call it b has then the form $b=3^N \cdot k -1 $ with the same parameter k . If b is then transformed by B decreasing steps and reaches c then c has the form $c={3^N \cdot k\ - 1 \over 2^B}$ If we want a cycle then this requires $c=a$ and this is also the ""1-cycle"" where $a$ is the minimal element. Well, thus identifying a with c this gives the ""critical formula"" $$ \tag{1.0} 2^N\cdot k - 1 = {3^N \cdot k -1 \over 2^B}$$ Here we assume some $N$ , get from this the dependend variable $B$ and from this try to find some or one admissible $k$ . Simply rearranging gives the more focused form which appears (using different letters) in J.Simon's paraphrase of R.Steiner's proof: $$ \tag{1.1} (2^S - 3^N)\cdot k = 2^B - 1 $$ $ \qquad \qquad \qquad $ where $S=\lceil N \log_2 3 \rceil$ and $B=S-N$ are simply convenient notations. Then the relevant statement is: For a 1-cycle of any length $N$ to exist we must have a solution in positive integers $(N,k)$ in eq. (1.1) . $\qquad \qquad$ (two other useful representations of that critical equation are $$ \small (2^S - 3^N)\cdot k = (2^S - 2^N )/2^N \quad , 2^S \gt 3^N \quad \text{ or }\\
\small 2^B = {2^S\over 2^N}={3^N \cdot k -1 \over 2^N\cdot k-1}$$ Using results of transcendental number theory and rational approximation with linear forms of logarithms Steiner proved, that there is no $2^B$ satisfying that formula except if $N=1$ and from this $S=2$ , $B=1$ , $k=1$ and $ a=1 \Rightarrow b = 2 = {3a+1\over 2} \Rightarrow  a=1={b \over 2} $ which is called the ""trivial cycle"". Question: how can it be proven by elementary means, that the formula (1.1) has not other solutions? Actually, this question is asking for help: to crosscheck my proof attempt, which I'll state in an answer below. *The Steiner-proof is not online, but John Simons has used it when he extended the Steiner-method for the 2-cycle. His article which contains a paraphrase is online at [AMS][1] . Note that I use different letters for the variables to be consistent with my own older discussions* [Added]: Empirically, the last shown form of the critical equation can never be satisfied for $N \gt 1, k \ge 1$ because the rhs falls empirically between the sharp bounds $$ \small  {3^N\over 2^N} \lt {3^N \cdot k -1 \over 2^N\cdot k-1} \lt \Big\lceil {3^N \over 2^N} \Big\rceil \qquad \text{ for }K=1 \ldots \infty$$ (and thus is never arriving the next integer above $(3/2)^N$ ) where the right inequality conforms with that conjectured bound in the Waring-problem, but which is not yet proven.","['collatz-conjecture', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
187935,Question about definition of topological manifold,"The following definition of topological manifold is given in Lee's Introduction to topological manifolds (2000) on page 33: A topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally Euclidean. I omitted the dimension since it's not relevant to my question so it's not a faithful quote. My question is: Doesn't Hausdorffness follow from being locally Euclidean? Pick $x,y$ in $M$. Then for each point there exists an open set homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$. Let's call them $U_x, U_y \subset M$. Then either they are already disjoint or if they intersect, by Euclidenaity, we can pick smaller open sets inside them so that the smaller sets don't intersect. So we have a Hausdorff space. Question 1 : What am I missing? Why does this not work? Question 2 : I guess we have to require second countability because otherwise the disjoint union $\bigsqcup_{r \in \mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q} (0,1)$ would be a $1$-manifold (that doesn't admit a countable basis) . Is that a correct counter example? Thanks for your help.","['general-topology', 'manifolds']"

187956,To show Taylor series of a Fourier transform $\hat{f }$ converges to $\hat{f}$,"I got some trouble with the following question. Say $f$ is in  $L^1(R)$  with compact support . I need to show (1) $\hat{f(\zeta)}$ is infinitely differentiable and all derivatives are continuous. (2) show Taylor series of $\hat{f(\zeta)}$ at $\zeta$ = 0 has infinitely radius of convergence , and converges to $\hat{f}$ (i.e. $\hat{f}$ is analytic and entire). I did part (1) and showed that radius of convergence of the Taylor series is infinity. But stuck at the part to show the TS does converge to $\hat{f}$. by calculation TS = $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\hat{f^n(0)}\zeta^n/n! = (-i)^n\int_{-M}^Mx^nf(x)dx\zeta^n/n!$. So $a_n= (-i)^n\int_{-M}^Mx^nf(x)/n!$. I used root test to show R is infinity. I then managed to show the error term $R(N):=\hat{f}-TS(N)=\hat{f}-\sum_{n=0}^{N}\hat{f^n(0)}\zeta^n/n! \to 0$ as $ N\to\infty$ but kind of stuck at here. Any thoughts ?

188129,Eigenvalue of $X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T$,"I just discovered today that $\mathbf{1}=(1,\ldots,1)$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$ of $X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T$ for certain $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ where $n \leq m$ and where the first column of $X$ is $\mathbf{1}$. Why is this? The motivation for this is from a statement that says that the residual of the fitted values of a linear least squares estimator sum to 0. In other words, given some standard linear model $y = X\beta + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is some random error, the least squares estimate for $\beta$ would be $\hat \beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ and the fitted value $\hat y = X\hat \beta$ or $X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$. Also important to note is that $X$ is a design matrix and thus has an intercept column where all elements are $1$. Then $\mathbf{1}^T(y - \hat y) = 0$. Through matlab, I inferred that it was because $X(X^TX)^{-1}X$ has eigenvector $\mathbf{1}$. I couldn't prove why this is the case.","['statistics', 'linear-algebra']"

A number of targets (globs) are randomly produced, and basically, the point of the game is to enter math equations to destroy targets in the least equations possible; writing an equation that intersects a glob means that it is destroyed.

188225,Measure theoretic definition of curl,"Is there a good measure theoretic definition of curl? To give an idea of the sort of equation that I'm looking for, here's now I define grad and div.  For the gradient, say we are given a Fréchet differentiable function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, then we can define $\nabla f(x)$ to be the element in $X$ such that
$$
\langle \nabla f(x),\eta \rangle = f^\prime(x)\eta.
$$
Hence, $\nabla f(x)$ is the Riesz representative of the Fréchet derivative (Note, we've assumed a Hilbert space.)  For the divergence, we have $f:X\rightarrow X$ and can define
$$
\nabla \cdot f(x)
= \lim_{\Omega\rightarrow \{x\}}\frac{1}{\mu(\Omega)} \int_{\Omega} \nabla\cdot f(x) d\mu
=\lim_{\Omega\rightarrow \{x\}}\frac{1}{\mu(\Omega)} \int_{\partial \Omega} f(x)\cdot n d\mu.
$$
Here, $\lim_{\Omega\rightarrow \{x\}} 1/\mu(\Omega)$ is shorthand for $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} 1/\mu(\Omega_k)$ where $\Omega_{k+1}\subseteq\Omega_k$ and $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\Omega_k = \{x\}$.  In addition, $\mu$ denotes some measure.  In any case, the first equality follows from the Lebesgue differentiation theorem and the second follows from integration by parts.  In this way, we require that $X$ be finite dimensional. Now, I'd like to get something along these lines for curl.  More specifically, I'm interested in a definition of curl that does not use differential forms or the exterior calculus. I haven't checked this closely, but if it helps, I believe that for $f:X\rightarrow X$, we have that
$$
(\nabla \times f(x))\times \delta x = f^\prime(x)\delta x-f^\prime(x)^*\delta x
$$
where $f^\prime(x)^*$ denotes the adjoint of the Fréchet derivative of $f$ at $x$.  In other words, the cross product between the curl of $f$ and $\delta x$ is the antisymmetric part of the Fréchet derivative.","['measure-theory', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

We call the two norms equivalent if every Cauchy-sequence with respect to $|\cdot|_1$ is also a Cauchy-sequence with respect to $|\cdot|_2$. Prove the following statement: $$|\cdot|_1\sim|\cdot|_2\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\exists \alpha\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}: \forall x\in\mathbb F: |x|_1=|x|_1^\alpha.$$ The direction ""$\Leftarrow$"" is straightforward: Let there an $\alpha$ with the property above, $(a_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ be a Cauchy sequence with respect to $|\cdot|_1$ and $\varepsilon_2\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ be arbitrary. Set $\varepsilon_1:=\varepsilon_2^\alpha$ and follow from the fact that $(a_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ is a Cauchy sequence, that there exists an $N\in\mathbb N$ such that
$$\forall n,m>N: |a_m-a_n|_1<\varepsilon_1.$$
Since $|\cdot|_1\sim|\cdot|_2$ and the definition of $\varepsilon_1$ we get that
$$\forall n,m>N: |a_m-a_n|_2^\alpha<\varepsilon_1^\alpha$$
which is equivalent to 
$$\forall n,m>N: |a_m-a_n|_2<\varepsilon_1$$

This problem comes up in networks of chemical reactions where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $\mathbf{x_i}$ are extreme vectors that define a proper, polyhedral cone at steady state (I don't understand entirely what all of this means - have a picture in my head though). More detail: Suppose you're looking at a concentration network involving $n$ chemical species , summarized in a vector $\textbf{u}$ , and $m$ reactions with rates $\textbf{w}(\textbf{u})$ . Then an ODE that describes the behaviour of this dynamical system is $$\frac{d \textbf{u}}{dt}=S\textbf{w}(\textbf{u}).$$ The stoichiometric matrix $S \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times m}$ describes how much of the species involved in a reaction is consumed / produced relative to one other. At steady state, $d\textbf{u}/dt|_{\textbf{u}=\textbf{u}^*}=0$ , we now look for the kernel / null space of $S$ , i.e. reaction rates $\textbf{w}$ such that $S\mathbf{w}=0$ . Apparently (however I don't fully understand this), the intersection of $\text{ker}(S)$ and $\mathbb{R}_+^m$ forms a proper, polyhedral cone. This cone can be represented by a nonnegative combination of the finite set of extreme vectors that are unique up to scaling by a positive constant - the $\textbf{x}_i$ above are these extreme vectors. ( I quoted the latter bit mostly verbatim from .) Possible route of solving this: So there appears to be a way to define this as a linear programming (LP) problem, but I don't quite see this. This seems to be suggested here . Any elaboration on the LP approach or any other way of solving this is greatly appreciated.","['linear-algebra', 'linear-programming', 'convex-cone']"

Framework There is a nonempty set $X$ and a sequence $T=(\Pi_0,\Pi_1,\ldots)$ of partitions of $X$ such that each partition is finite, for every two points in $X$ there is an index $n$ such that the two points lie in different cells of $\Pi_n$, and $\Pi_{n+1}$ is finer than $\Pi_n$ for all $n$. We call this sequence a tree . That $\Pi_{n+1}$ is finer than $\Pi_n$, means that every cell in $\Pi_n$ is a union of cells in $\Pi_{n+1}$. There is a finitely additive probability measure $\mu$ on the algebra generated by $\bigcup_n\Pi_n$. A chain in the tree is a sequence $(c_0,c_1,\ldots)\in\prod_n \Pi_n$ such that $c_n\supseteq c_{n+1}$ for all $n$. We say that $\mu$ is atomless if for every chain $(c_0,c_1,\ldots)$, we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(c_n)=0$. Question The exercise I have trouble with requires us to show the following: If $\mu$ is atomless, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(c_n)=0$ uniformly
  over all chains. It is relatively easy to see that this is equivalent to showing that for each $\epsilon>0$, there exists an $n$ such that for all $c\in\Pi_n$ we have $\mu(c)<\epsilon$, but I don't know what more I can do.","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory']"

If $J(u_0)< \infty$ then exist an absolute minimum $u \in K$ of the functional $J$. Since $J$ is non-negative there is a minimal sequence $u_k, k \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $\nabla u_k$ are bounded in $L^{2}(\Omega)$ and since $H^{n-1}(S)$ is positive $u_k -u^0$ are bounded in $L^2(B_r \cap \Omega)$ for large $R$. Therefore there is an $u \in K$, such that for a subsequence

\nabla u_k \rightarrow \nabla u \quad \mbox{weakly in} \quad L^2(\Omega), \ u_k \rightarrow u \quad \mbox{almost everywhere in} \  \Omega.

\chi(\{u_k>0\})  \rightarrow \gamma \quad \mbox{weakly star in} \quad L^\infty(\Omega).

188450,Zeta functions of groups and an identity of Ramanujan,"Zeta functions are being developed for all sorts of mathematical objects these days. One general situation is that of zeta functions of groups. If $G$ is a finitely generated group then we let $$\zeta_G(s):=\sum_{H\le_{\Large f} G}[G:H]^{-s}=\sum_{n\ge1}a_n(G)\,n^{-s}\tag{1}$$ 
$$\text{where}\quad a_n(G):=\#\{H\le G: [G:H]=n\}. \tag{2}$$ Note that $H\le_fG$ here stands for finite-index subgroups $H$. Other zeta functions are obtained by restricting to certain types of subgroups, like normal ones for example. If $G$ is nilpotent then it is a direct product of Sylow $p$-subgroups, which yields an Euler product factorization for $\zeta_G(s)$. This allows a handful of examples to be explicitly computed with the Riemann zeta function; e.g.: $$\zeta_{\Bbb Z^d}(s)=\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)\cdots\zeta(s-d+1);\tag{3}$$ 
$$\zeta_{H_{\large3}(\Bbb Z)}(s)=\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)\zeta(2s-2)\zeta(2s-3)}{\zeta(3s-3)},\tag{4}$$ where $H_3(\Bbb Z)$ is the discrete Heisenberg group. See $p$- adic integration and the theory of groups (.ps) or I bet it would also be somewhere in Lectures on Profinite Topics in Group Theory 's Chapter $\rm III$. Professor B. Sury points out the curious resemblance with a well-known identity of Ramanujan: $$\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\sigma_a(n)\sigma_b(n)}{n^s}=\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-a)\zeta(s-b)\zeta(s-a-b)}{\zeta(2s-a-b)}.\tag{5}$$ Can we see $(5)$ as the zeta functions associated to a 'natural' family of groups indexed by $a,b\in\Bbb N$?","['zeta-functions', 'riemann-zeta', 'group-theory']"

No.  It's $\sin\theta \,\mathrm d\theta \,\mathrm d\phi$ , where $\theta$ is the inclination angle and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. For example, attempting to integrate the unit sphere without the $\sin\theta$ term: $$
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \mathrm d\theta \,\mathrm d\phi = 2 \pi^2.
$$ With the $\sin\theta$ term you get $$
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \sin\theta \,\mathrm d\theta \,\mathrm d\phi = 4 \pi.
$$ But I'm puzzled why you need to multiply the differential solid angle by $\sin\theta$ .

Given a 2-dimensional grid that is divided into 2x2 tiles, with each tile having a specific feature in exactly one of it's four squares, I'm trying to figure out the probability of an overlaid square tile (2x2 minimum, but the interesting cases are larger) having a certain number of feature squares within it. I can brute-force the small cases, but the non-uniform distribution of features (i.e. conditional probabilities based on neighboring squares and grid constraints) as well as the different possible alignments quickly make larger cases a counting nightmare. By way of a little better example, a 2x2 overlay, if aligned to the underlying grid, obviously will have just one feature square. If it's misaligned either horizontally or vertically, it can have 0, 1, or 2 squares, and if it's misaligned in both directions, it
could have anywhere between 0 and 4 squares. The probabilities (calculated by just counting
the possible combinations) come out to about 20.4% chance of 0 tiles, 60.6% chance of 1, 17.8% for 2, 1.8% for 3, and about 0.1% for all 4. A 3x3 overlay, calculated similarly, has a minimum of 1 square (18.75%), but can have 2, 3, or 4 (maximum) with respective probabilities of 43.75%, 31.25% and 6.25%.

(a \circ c) \circ (a \circ b)    &= d \circ d \\
\Leftrightarrow d \circ (d \circ c^{-1} \circ b) &= d \circ d \\
\Leftrightarrow d \circ c^{-1} \circ b           &= d\\
\Leftrightarrow c^{-1} \circ b &= e\\
\Leftrightarrow b &= c
\end{align}$ As the group is finite, this also means it is exactly once in every row/column ($\forall a,b \in G: a \circ b = x$ with $x \in G$). Now my question is: Does a group with an infinite number of elements exist, that has not every element in every row/column of its Cayley table?

Thus if there are $n$ elements that belong to $t(G)$ we must have another $n$ elements that belong to $G$. Hence, $t(G)$ has an even number of elements.

First, a base for the subspace topology on $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{(a,b)\cap \mathbb{Q}\,|\,a<b \in \mathbb{R}\}$, yes? To separate the rationals into two disjoint open sets (a space is disconnected if it can be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets), we need the end of one 'interval' to lie between two rational numbers, which intuitively seems to be problematic at first, since we can find rational numbers arbitrarily close to each other. However, the rationals are countable.  So label them as $a_1, a_2, ...\,$.  Can we then take two arbitrary rationals, $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$, and then take the relatively open sets $(-\infty,a_i)$ and $(a_{i+1},\infty)$, which are clearly disjoint, and whose union is clearly $\mathbb{Q}$ as a separation of $\mathbb{Q}$?",['general-topology']

and no two derivatives has a common root. A few things to keep in mind are that it is not hard to show that
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}\frac {d^n}{dx^n}x^{1/x}=\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}\frac {d^n}{dx^n}x^{1/x}=0$$ for all $n\geq 1$ and that $x^{1/x}$ is smooth and then to use these to show that the $n$th derivative has at least $n$ positive real zeroes.

Now, let $f:A\rightarrow A$ and $g:B\rightarrow B$ be two maps. $f$ and $g$ are said to be topologically conjugate it there exists a homeomorphism $h:A\rightarrow B$ such that, $h\circ f=g \circ h$. Mappings which are topologically conjugate are completely equivalent in terms of their dynamics. From ""An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical System"" of R. L. Devaney I know that $f: S^{1} \rightarrow S^{1}$ given by $f(\theta)=2 \theta$ is chaotic ($S^1$ denote the unit circle in the plane). Because: the angular distance between two points is doubled upon iteration of $f$. Hence $f$ is sensitive to initial condition. Topologically transitive also follows from this observation since any small arc in $S^1$ is eventually expanded by some $f^k$ to cover all of $S^1$. A point on $S^1$ is determined by any angle of the form $\theta+2k\pi$ (in radians) for an integer $k$. Now $f^n (\theta)=2^n \theta$ so that $\theta$ is periodic of period n if and only if $2^n \theta=\theta+2k\pi$, i.e. $\theta=2k\pi / (2^n - 1)$ where $1\leq k\leq 2^n$ is an integer. Hence the periodic points of period n for $f$ are the $(2^n - 1)$-th roots of unity. It follows that the set of periodic points are dense in $S^1$.
Using this definition, I want to prove that $F(x)=4x^3-3x$ is chaotic on the interval [-1,1]. I tried to do the exercise in this way: is easy to show that $g(\theta)=3\theta$ is chaotic.

188882,Is every group a Galois group?,"It is well-known that any finite group is the Galois group of a Galois extension. This follows from Cayley's theorem (as can be seen in this answer ). This (linked) answer led me to the following question: What about infinite groups? Infinite groups appear as Galois groups on infinite extensions, as when one defines the absolute Galois group of a field $F$. There is a natural topology on the Galois group, called the Krull topology, which turns this group into a profinite group (i.e. a compact, totally disconnected, Hausdorff topological group). It can be proven that any profinite group is the Galois group of an extension (see this short paper by Waterhouse). Therefore, the above question is equivalent to the following: Can any group be given the structure of a profinite group? I would like to get more information about this question. In particular, if the answer is no, are there definite restrictions (e.g. cardinality)?","['galois-theory', 'topological-groups', 'group-theory']"
188884,Group action on manifold,"I met a question as follows: Suppose $G$ is a finite group acting freely on a manifold $M$. Show the following: 1) $M/G$ is a manifold. 2) $H^i_{dR}(M/G)=H^i_{dR}(M)^G$. 3) if $N$ is a compact connected $n$- dimensional manifold which is non-orientable, then $H^n_{dR}(n)=0$. For the first question, I can understand it in the topological manifold case. When it comes to the smooth manifold, I cannot see clearly how the local structure is preserved to be smooth during the quotient. Could someone explain it? Is it necessary to have $G$ to be finite, or is it possible to have infinite $G$ with discrete topology? The second one should be easier. I would say the relation holds for the algebra of smooth maps which descends to cohomology. The third one is easy using Poincare duality, but could any one provide an solution via part two?",['differential-geometry']
188889,Expiring coupon collector's problem,"The well-studied coupon collector's problem asks, given $N$ different coupons from which coupons are being drawn with equal probability and with replacement: How many coupons do you expect to need to draw before having drawn each coupon at least once? For large $N$, the expected number of draws is known to be $\Theta(N\log N)$.  What is known about the following variation? One coupon is drawn each day, and each coupon expires $M \ge N$ days after being drawn.
  How many coupons do you expect to need to draw before having at least one unexpired copy of each coupon? Presumably if $M$ is large enough (say, $M\in\Omega(N\log N)$), it will have no effect on the problem, and the expected number of draws will still be $\Theta(N\log N)$.  On the other hand, if $M=N$, a perfect run of $N$ distinct coupons is required.  For any $N$ consecutive days, the probability of this happening is
$$
\frac{N!}{N^N}\sim \frac{\sqrt{2\pi N}}{e^N},$$
and so the expected number of draws must grow exponentially with $N$.  This is a large change in the expected time (from almost linear to exponential) corresponding to a small change in the expiration behavior (from almost linear to linear).  Can anything precise be said about the intermediate cases?","['coupon-collector', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

188915,"Throwing the dice, sum of the points","We are throwing the die (original cube for the board games). How many are ways to get the sum of the points equal to $n$ ? I've heard this problem today in the morning and still can't deal with it, which is tiring. The only way I see it, is that I am looking for the number of solutions of equations: $\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = n$ for all possible $k$, where $1\le x_i\le 6$ for all $1\le i\le k$. So if I find the coefficient before $x^n$ in expansion to series this sum: $$\sum_{k=1}^n (x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6)^k=\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{1-x^7}{1-x}\right)^k$$ it will be over. But I completely don't know how to do that. Or maybe there is a simpler solution for this problem?","['dice', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
