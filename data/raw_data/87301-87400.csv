1165263,What should be the intuition when working with compactness?,"I have a question that may be regarded by many as duplicate since there's a similar one at MathOverflow. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the compact sets are those that are closed and bounded, however the guy who answered this question and had his answer accepted says that compactness is some analogue of finiteness .  In my intuitive view of finiteness, only boundedness would suffice to say that a certain subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is in some sense ""finite"". On the other hand there's the other definition of compactness (in terms of covers) which is the one I really need to work with and I cannot see how that definition implies this intuition on finiteness. To prove a set is compact I know they must show that for every open cover there's a finite subcover; the problem is that I can't see intuitively how one could show this for every cover . Also when trying to disprove compactness the books I've read start presenting strange covers that I would have never thought about. I think my real problem is that I didn't yet get the intuition on compactness. So, what intuition should we have about compact sets in general and how should we really put this definition to use? Can someone provide some reference that shows how to understand the process of proving (and disproving) compactness?","['general-topology', 'intuition', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"
1165286,Why are convex polyhedral cones closed?,"Let $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, $v_1, \dots, v_s \in V$ and let $\sigma = \text{Cone}(v_1, \dots, v_s) = \{r_1v_1 + \dots + r_sv_s \mid r_i \geq 0\}$ be the associated convex polyhedral cone in $V$. Why is $\sigma$ closed in the euclidean topology? My attempts: $1.$ Define $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^s \to V$ as the unique linear mapping satisfying $e_i \mapsto v_i$. Then we have $\sigma = \varphi(\sigma')$, $\sigma' = \text{Cone}(e_1, \dots, e_s)$. Unfortunately, linear maps do not send closed sets to closed sets. But what is with closed sets which are themselves convex polyhedric cones? $2.$ Define $\psi: \text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_s) \to \mathbb{R}^s$ as the unique linear mapping satisfying $v_i \mapsto e_i$. Then $\sigma = \psi^{-1}(\sigma')$. But $\psi$ isn't well defined, so this naive try won't work.

1165324,Can we always exploit Taylor's approximation in order to avoid using l'Hopital rule?,"We are given two  functions, namely: $f, g: U^\circ\subset \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ where $0 \in \overline{U}$. Suppose you want to compute the limit  $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$
and that $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 0} g(x) = 0$. 
In addition, suppose that l'Hopital's theorem hypothesis are satisfied and that exploiting l'Hopital rule we found that $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L \in \{\mathbb{R}, \pm\infty\}.$$
Can the same result be obtained using Taylor's approximation?
And if we consider instead $\lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ anything changes? My speculations and question's motivation follow. In order  to apply Taylor's approximation one has to choose a function, an approximation point and an order of approximation.
Taylor's formula gives us two objects: a polynomial and a reminder.
But the only thing we know about the reminder is its behavior near the approximation point.
So in order to apply Taylor to the functions $f,g$ we have to  choose  0 as approximation point (otherwise how can we get rid of the reminder?).
It follows that $f,g$  have to be defined in $0$.
This can be problematic, for example if $f(x) = \log(x) $ and $g(x) = x^{-1}$
we can apply l'Hopital's rule and get to $$ \frac{-x^2}{x} \to 0.$$
But we are unable to expand $f$ or $g$ near $0$ as them are not defined in $0$. So it seems to me that Taylor  method alone cannot cover all cases of interest. But I must  be wrong since I've read Why are people so interested in finding limits without l'Hôpital's rule? and I figured out that many people rely only on Taylor's method (which is a beautiful thing in my opinion) and that in some universities L'Hopital's rule use is even discouraged.","['taylor-expansion', 'limits-without-lhopital', 'limits']"

Apparently for $m=0$ we just have $H_0^0 (\Omega)=L^2(\Omega).$ Despite, from the definition I don't see a defining property for all the functions in $H_0^m$?- I mean it is intuitively clear to me what $H^m$ is (weakly differentiable functions that are square integrable in every derivative) , but this closure definition is pretty unclear to me in the sense that I don't understand what these functions have in common. What is so special about this space? In particular, what is the difference between $H^m(\Omega)$ and $H_0^m(\Omega)$?

1165401,Geometric definitions of infinity,"There are several definitions of ""infinite set"" that are common in set theory.  For instance, a set $S$ is finite if there is a bijection between a natural number $n$ and $S$; it is infinite otherwise.  Alternatively, one can define a set $S$ to be infinite if there is an injection from the natural numbers into it.  Alternatively, there is the definition of ""Dedekind infinite"" sets, i.e., those for which there is an injection into a proper subset of themselves.  All of these definitions can be shown to be equivalent under suitable assumptions (e.g., some require choice). All of these definitions, however, are set-theoretic in character, in that they rely on the set-theoretic definition of function, injection, etc.  They also characterize what it means for a set to contain infinitely many objects, rather than for a space to be infinitely divisible or infinite in extension. Two of the definitions require appeal to the natural numbers and so have a bit of an ""arithmetic"" flavor.  Here's my question:  are there well-known, precise  ""geometric"" definitions of what it means for space to be infinite?  Of course, it depends what one counts as ""geometric"", and so I realize this question is vague.  But I am interested in whether there definitions that rely less on set theoretic properties of functions and the natural numbers, and more on properties of ""space"" in some sense. Of course, there are order-theoretic conditions that might be used to characterize infinite spaces (e.g., density and unboundedness entail a space is infinite in a sense).  Any other ideas? Edit: MVG's suggestion is really helpful.  It's true I wasn't clear whether I wanted a purely ""geometric"" definition of a space (i) containing infinitely many points, (ii) having infinite measure, or (iii) containing a subspace that extends infinitely in some direction (e.g., a ray in the plane).  MVG suggests ""geometric"" definitions of a space that contains infinitely many points.  So here's perhaps a more precise question that I can ask now about  how to use geometric concepts to define subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ having infinite measure, or that contain sets that extend infinitely in some direction. For example, say a subset $S$ of a plane is ""infinite"" if it has the following properties:
 1.  $S$ contains either a circle or square.
 2. Every circle in $S$ is circumscribed by a square lying in $S$.
 3. Every square in $S$ is circumscribed by a circle lying in $S$.
 4. The interior of any square in $S$ lies in $S$. Then $S$ is the entire plane, I think, as you can get a nested sequence of circles of arbitrarily large radius.  A similar definition should work in higher definitions.  So it seems, perhaps by cheating, that we've characterized what it would mean for section of a plane to be unbounded or infinite in every direction using only figures that can be constructed via straight-edges and compass. Of course, my definition wouldn't pick out the upper-right quadrant of the plane as being ""infinite"" (as a square with vertex at the origin could not be inscribed in a circle lying in the quadrant), but I think we can modify my definition slightly to fix it (e.g., by inscribing squares in quarter circles and vice versa).  In general, does something similar work for all convex subsets of the plane? So perhaps here's the more precise question. Problem:  Let $S$ be a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Find a collection of conditions/sentences $C$ such that (i) $C$ mentions only figures that are constructible via by standard constraints (e.g., in the plane, straight-edge and compass in the plane) and (ii) $S$ satisfies $C$ if and only if the Lebesgue measure of $S$ is infinite, or $S$ contains some subset $T$ that has infinite Lebesgue measure of lower dimension.","['geometry', 'order-theory', 'infinity', 'elementary-set-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

1165431,Is a function Lipschitz if and only if its derivative is bounded?,"Is the following statement true? Let $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous and differentiable. $f$ Lipschitz $\leftrightarrow \exists M:\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\ |f'(x)|\leq M$ If $f'$ is bounded, it is Lipschitz, that's obvious. Does that work the other way around? Let $f$ be $M$ -Lipschitz, that is to say $\forall x_1, x_2\in\mathbb{R},\ |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| \leq M|x_1 - x_2|$ , where $M$ is independent of $x_1, x_2$ . Let $x_1 <x_2$ be arbitrary. $f$ is continuous, so by the mean value theorem, there exists $c\in\mathbb{R}, x_1 < c < x_2$ , such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} \Rightarrow |f'(c)| = |\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}| \leq M$ .

1165589,"$V^* \not\cong V$ if $V$ is infinite-dimensional, problem showing that $\text{Card}(\Lambda \times F) < \text{Card}\left(F^\Lambda\right)$.","Let $V$ be a vector space over $F$. Consider the dual vector space $V^* = \{f: V \to F\text{ }|\text{ }f\text{ is linear}\}$. Show that if $V$ is infinite-dimensional, then $V^*$ is not isomorphic to $V$. Let $\Lambda$ be an index set. Then we have the following. Proposition. Let $F$ be  field. Then$$\left(\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F\right)^* \cong \prod_{i \in \Lambda} F,$$where$$\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F = \{\phi: \Lambda \to F\text{ }|\text{ only finitely many elements in }\Lambda\text{ have nonzero images}\}$$and$$\prod_{i \in \Lambda} F = \{\chi: \Lambda \to F\}.$$ Proof. In order to see this: First of all, for any $\chi \in \prod_{i \in \Lambda}F$, it corresponds a linear map$$f_\chi: \bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F \to F,\text{ }\phi \mapsto \sum_{i \in \Lambda} \phi(i)\chi(i).$$Notice that the right-hand side is actually a finite sum, so $f_\chi$ is well-defined. It can be checked easily that $f_\chi$ is indeed a linear function on $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda}F$. Next, suppose $f$ is any linear function on $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda}F$. We define a map$$\chi: \Lambda \to F,\text{ } i \mapsto f(e_i),$$where $e_i$ is a function from $\Lambda$ to $F$ that sends $i$ to $1$ and sends any $j \neq i$ to $0$. Then we claim that $f = f_\chi$: this is because, for any $\phi \in \bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$, $\phi = \sum_{i \in \Lambda} \phi(i)e_i$. So we have$$f_\chi(\phi) = \sum_{i \in \Lambda} \phi(i)\chi(i) = \sum_{i \in \Lambda} \phi(i)f(e_i) = f\left(\sum_{i \in \Lambda} \phi(i)e_i\right) = f(\phi).$$Hence $f = f_\chi$ and so $f$ is an element in $\prod_{i \in \Lambda}F$.$\tag*{$\square$}$ Our goal is to show that when $\Lambda$ is infinite, $\left(\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F\right)^* \cong \prod_{i \in \Lambda}F$ is not isomorphic to $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$. We actually show that the two sets $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$ and $\prod_{i \in \Lambda} F$ have different cardinalities. So there will be no bijection between $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$ and $\prod_{i \in \Lambda} F$. Denote the cardinality of a set $X$ by $\text{Card}(X)$. Using set theory arguments, we can prove the following: For every $F$,$$\text{Card}\left(\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F\right) = \text{Card}(\Lambda \times F).$$$($Actually, $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$ is a countable union of sets with the same cardinality as $\Lambda \times F$.$)$ $$\text{Card}\left(\prod_{i \in \Lambda} F\right)  = \text{Card}\left(F^\Lambda\right).$$ Finally, we should always have $$\text{Card}(\Lambda \times F) < \text{Card}\left(F^\Lambda\right)$$when $\Lambda$ is infinite. My first question is, how do we prove this? I believe this is correct but I do not know how to prove this. At least when $F$ and $\Lambda$ are both countable, we know this inequality is correct because it is simply $\aleph_0 < \aleph_1$. Notice that any vector space can be written as the form $\bigoplus_{i \in \Lambda} F$ for some $\Lambda$. So if we have the above inequality holds for any $F$ and infinite $\Lambda$, then we can prove that for any infinite-dimensional vector space $V$, $V^*$ is not isomorphic to $V$. For something that should intuitively be true, this proof was long, tedious, and annoying. So my second question is, does there exist a simpler proof out there of the fact $V^* \not\cong V$ if $V$ is infinite-dimensional?

1165726,Prove that a subspace of dimension $n$ of a vector space of dimension $n$ is the whole space.,"Maybe this is a stupid question. I was brought to this from the observation that an infinite dimensional vector space can have proper subspace that have the same dimension of the whole space. But, for a finite dimensional vector space, as $\mathbb{R}^n$ it seems obvious that, if $S$ is a subspace of dimension $n$,  than  $S=\mathbb{R}^n$. I've tempted to give a proof this statement, thinking that was a simple exercise, but I am no able to find  a good way. I suppose that I'm lost in a teacup so I need an help. Added after the first answers. The answer of @Mark Joshi was my first idea, so I llustrate better where is my trouble. Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a subspace of dimension $n$. This means, by definition, that: 1) there exists a set of linearly independent vectors $\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}$ with $v_i \in S$ and 2) $\forall v \in S$ we have $v \ne v_i \; \forall i \Rightarrow \{v, v_1,\cdots,v_n\} $ are linearly dependent. Note that 2) is valid for $v\in S$ and all $v_i \in S$. Since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space, we know that there exists a set $\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_n\}$ of vectors $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^n $ such that: 3) $\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_n\}$ are linearly independent and 4) $\forall u \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we have $u \ne u_i \; \forall i \Rightarrow \{u, u_1,\cdots,u_n\} $ are linearly dependent. Now, if $u, u_i \in \mathbb{R}^n/S$ I can not conclude from 1) and 2) that $u$ is a linear combination of $\{v_i\}$ and this means that I cannot decide if it is in the span of $ \{v, v_1,\cdots,v_n\} $. Surely it is a linear combination of $\{u_1,u_2,\cdots,u_n\}$ , but some (or all) of these $u_i$ can well not be elements of $S$. So it seams that we can have a vector $u$ that is a linear combination of $n$ linearly independent $\{u_i\}$ but we connot proof that it is also a linear combination of $\{v_i\}$.

Given two partitions $\vec{f} \in Partitions(N)$ and $\vec{f}' \in Paritions(N)$ we define the distance between two partitions to be $$dist\left(\vec{f},\vec{f'} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} \left|f_i-f_i' \right| \ . $$ Intuitively, if we view each $f_i$ as a stack of $f_i$ individual blocks then the distance is the number of blocks we would need to move to change partition $\vec{f}$ into $\vec{f}'$.

1165759,What time did the snow start? Snow Plow,"I am having trouble proceeding with the problem below. I have solved some stuff to a certain extent, but do not understand what to do from here. The problem statement is: One morning snow began to fall at a heavy and constant rate. A snowplow starts out at 8:00am and at 9:00am it has traveled 2 miles. By 10:00am it has traveled 3 miles. Assuming that the plow removes a constant volume of snow per hour, determine the time at which it started to snow. Hint : Let t denote the time since the snow started and T be the time when the snowplow started out. Let x be the distance the snowplow has traveled, and h the height of the snow which is a function of t . Assuming a constant volume of snow per hour is removed implies the speed of the plow times the height of the snow is a constant. Set up and solve differential equations involving dx/dt and dh/dt . My work so far: 
$$ \frac {dh}{dt} = C$$
$$ \int {\frac {dh}{dt}} = \int {C}$$
$$ h(t) = Ct+Z $$

If referring to a Pythagorean triangle, let's say a triangle where $a=3$, $b=4$, and $c=5$, or $a=\cos$ $b=\sin$ and $c=\text{hypotenuse}$. $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$.

However, when I try to make sense of the $\tan^2x+1 = \sec^2x$ and $1+\cot^2x=\csc^2x$ identity, using the triangle example from above, it doesn't work. For example, here's how I did it on paper, $\tan^2x + 1 = {\sin^2x\over \cos^2x} + 1$, so I would get using the triangle above, ${4^2\over 3^2} + 1 = {16\over 9} + 1 = 2.777777778$ Now on the right hand side, $\sec^2x, = {1\over \cos^2x} = {1\over 3^2} = .1111111111$.

The set $\{\text T, \text F\}^{\mathcal{P}(C)}$ is the set of all boolean functions over all subsets of $C$. This comes from the notation $\mathcal{Y}^\mathcal{X}$ which is the set of all functions $f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$. The set of all conjugations will be a subset of $\{\text T, \text F\}^{\mathcal{P}(C)}$ which I'd like to call $\mathcal{H}_C$. $$
\mathcal{H}_C = \left\{\ \bigwedge_c^X c \ \middle| \ X \in \mathcal{P}(C) \ \right\}

\mathcal{L}_C = \left\{\ \bigvee_c^X c \ \middle| \ X \in \mathcal{P}(C) \ \right\}
$$ $$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{H}_C} \equiv \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{L}_C}
$$ Any boolean function over $C$ will have at least one corresponding element in each of those two sets and there are no boolean functions over $C$ that are unrepresented by either of them. This follows from the fact that every boolean function has a conjunctive normal form and a disjunctive normal form. The set of all disjunctive normal forms is $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{H}_C}$ and the set of all conjunctive normal forms is $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{L}_C}$. Now the fruit of the question: For any set of literals $C$, $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{L}_C} \subseteq \{\text T, \text F\}^{\mathcal{P}(C)}$. $$
\left|\mathcal{H}_C\right| = \left|\mathcal{L}_C\right| = \sqrt{3}^{|C|} \\
\left|\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{L}_C}\right| = \left|\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{H}_C}\right| = \sqrt{3^{\sqrt{3}^{|C|}}} \\
\left|\{\text T, \text F\}^{\mathcal{P}(C)}\right| = \sqrt{2^{\sqrt{2}^{|C|}}}
$$ Any conjunction can be described as a tuple of states for every non-complementary literal. Each literal can be either absent, present, or its complement can be present. Half of the literals are compliments of other literals, so they're excluded. Therefore, there are $3^{\frac{|C|}{2}}$ conjugations. The same applies to disjunctions. Combining this logic, we have a total number of conjunctive normal forms over $C$. The same applies for disjunctive normal forms. You can easily see that the number of distinct functions is smaller than the number of conjunctive normal forms. However, shouldn't there be an equal number of distinct functions as there are normal forms? I've read before that every distinct function has exactly one conjunctive normal form. Is this wrong or am I wrong in something I've presented above? As seen on Wikipedia right now Any particular Boolean function can be represented by one and only one full disjunctive normal form... Above, I showed that the number of disjunctive normal forms and the number of conjunctive normal forms are the same, so either set can be used for this argument. Edit:
The total number of boolean functions was accounting for literals and their complements both being independent variables. This is not the case so the number was rooted. The question still stands: Why are there are more forms than functions?","['boolean-algebra', 'functions']"

1166266,Variants of Dirichlet's theorem on Fourier series,"The following is Dirichlet's theorem on Fourier series: Theorem : If $f(t)$ is a bounded periodic function which in any one period has at most a finite number of local maxima and minima and a finite number of points of discontinuity, then the Fourier series of $f(t)$ converges to $f(t)$ at all points where $f(t)$ is continuous and converges to the average of the right- and left-hand limits of $f(t)$ at each point where $f(t)$ is discontinuous. I would like to know about generalizations of Dirichlet's theorem. Specifically: Dirichlet's theorem gives a sufficient condition for convergence of
the Fourier series. Are necessary conditions known? i.e. Is
something like a converse known for Dirichlet's theorem? The step function does not satisfy Dirichlet's theorem - every value of $t$ is a local minima or maxima - yet it has a convergent
Fourier series and (I believe) the conclusions of Dirichlet's
theorem are valid in this case. Is there a generalization of
Dirichlet's theorem that accounts for the step function?","['fourier-series', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

In the proof of Itó's formula, he defines a sequence of stopping times $(T_n)$ by $$ T_n = \begin{array}{cc}
  \Bigg\{ & 
    \begin{array}{cc}
      0, & |X_0| > n \\
      \inf\{ t \geq 0: |A_t| > n \text{ or } |M_t|>n \text{ or } \langle M \rangle_t >n\}, & |X_0| \leq n.
          \end{array}\end{array}
$$ Then he claims that by considering the stopped process $X^{T_n}$, we can assume that $X_0$ is bounded. I don't understand this, as $X^{T_n}_0 = X_0$ is not necessarily bounded.","['stochastic-processes', 'martingales', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stopping-times']"
1166994,Linearity of expectation for infinite sums?,"I have a question related to this post: Expected value of infinite sum Is the condition listed necessary/sufficient (or both?) For instance, I'm thinking of $X_n=\frac{1}{n}Z_n$, where $Z_n \sim$N(0,1) are iid.  It ""feels like"" $E\sum_{n=1}^\infty X_n$=0, but $\sum_{n=1}^\infty E|X_n|$ =$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}E|Z_n|$ =$E|Z_1|\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}=\infty$.  Thus, we can't use the result listed above to justify interchanging expectation and summation.  But I was wondering if my feeling is right.",['probability']

Locally speaking, geodesics always minimize arc length (see Manfredo, for example). But I can't visualize a surface having geodesics that maximize the arc length in Riemannian manifolds. Is it possible? Consider the sphere for instance (Figure 1 ). The geodesic represented as full line minimizes the path locally. What about the geodesic pictured as dashed line? Certainly, it's not maximize the arc length since there is a lot of other curves that have longer paths. Is this dashed geodesic also a locally minimum path? Or is it neither maximum nor minimum?","['calculus-of-variations', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{t(1-y)}{1+t^2}$$ then I rewrote it as 
$$\int \frac{t}{1+t^2} dt=\int \frac{1}{1-y} dy $$

There is guaranteed to be a $k$ such that $\sqrt{n!} \leq k! \leq n \sqrt{n!}$ just by a simple counting argument.

1167170,Have there been any attempts to unify statistics and decision theory into a single framework that refrains from estimating probabilities?,"If I understand correctly: statistics, narrowly construed, is all about using data to estimate probabilities. decision theory can then be applied to those probabilities in order to predict which decisions maximize expected utility. I may be completely off the mark here, but I have a hunch that this is really the wrong way of going about it. Perhaps we should look for decision-theoretic methods that skip the estimation of probabilities altogether and make utility-maximizing decisions ""straight from the data,"" so to speak. Imaginably, this could circumvent certain difficulties with the Bayesian paradigm, like finding an uninformative prior distribution . Question. Have there been any attempts to unify statistics and decision theory into a single framework that refrains from estimating probabilities, and instead makes utility-maximizing decisions ""straight from the data""?
