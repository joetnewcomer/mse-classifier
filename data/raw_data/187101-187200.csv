3476589,Predicate Logic - Use of Domination Law,"I have been working on school project for a few days and have encountered this problem on predicate logic, which I can't figure out.
I am given an argument : H1: p ∧ q ,
H2: p → ¬(q ∧ z),
H3: r → z ,
H4: m ∧ p → r This should imply ¬m. This is what I have got:
1. H1 and use Simplification to get p. Take p from step 1 and H2 to get p ∧ (p → ¬(q ∧ z)), then use modus ponens to get ¬(q ∧ z). Use De Morgan's law on ¬(q ∧ z) to get ¬q ∨ ¬z. Take q from H1 to get q ∧ (¬q ∨ ¬z), which can be rewritten as q ∧ (q → ¬z), which can be simplified using modus ponens to ¬z. Take ¬z from 4 and H3 to get ¬z ∧ (r → z). This can be simplified using modus tollens to ¬r. Rewrite H4 using contraposition, arriving at (¬r → ¬(m ∧ p)). Using De Morgan's we can adjust the left side of the argument, arriving at (¬r → (¬m ∨ ¬p)). Combining step 5 and 7 we arrive at ¬r ∧ (¬r → (¬m ∨ ¬p)), which can be simplified using modus ponens to ¬m ∨ ¬p. And now the step I am a little confused about. We assume that H1 is true, hence p must be true, which implies, that its complement, ¬p, must be false. Thus we can restate the result of 8 and get (¬m ∨ false), which logically gives us ¬m. So, is step 9 correct reasoning? Or am I missing something? I have got really excited about this, and am very keen to get this right. So if there is something wrong, please let me know, I will try to work out some other way. Thank you!","['predicate-logic', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

So far, I have only managed to prove that $I\ge\sqrt{2}-{1\over2}$ , the proof of which is below. Let $c(t)$ be a unit speed parametrization of $C$ such that $c(0)=(0,1)$ and $c(L)=(1,0)$ , where $L$ is the length of $c$ . Let $f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ . Notice that $f(c(t))=\|c(t)\|$ and $\|c'(t)\|=1$ since $c$ is unit speed. Then, $I=\int_{C}fds=\int_{0}^Lf(c(t))\|c'(t)\|dt=\int_{0}^L\|c(t)\|ds$ . Since $c$ is unit speed, $-1\le{d\over{dt}}\|c(t)\|dt\le1$ . Also, $\|c(0)\|=\|c(L)\|=1$ . So, if $L\ge2$ , then $\int_{0}^{1}\|c(t)\|dt\ge{1\over2}$ . Similarly, $\int_{L-1}^{L}\|c(t)\|dt\ge{1\over2}$ , so $\int_{0}^{L}\|c(t)\|dt\ge{1}$ , meaning we now only need consider $L<2$ . If $L<2$ , then $\int_{0}^{L\over2}\|c(t)\|dt\ge{L\over{2}}(1-{L\over2})+{L^2\over8}\le\int_{L\over2}^{L}\|c(t)\|dt$ , so $\int_{0}^{L}\|c(t)\|dt)\ge{L-{L^2\over4}}$ . Finally, since the distance between $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ is $\sqrt2$ , $L\ge\sqrt2$ . Since $L-{L^2\over4}$ is increasing over the interval $[\sqrt2,2]$ , this implies $I\ge\sqrt2-{{\sqrt2}^2\over4}=\sqrt2-{1\over2}$ . This bound is somewhat close to $1$ at approximately $0.914...$ , however I have been unable to find any way to proceed with improving upon my current inequality.

3476688,Continuity requirements for Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure (Question 114X(b) in D.H. Fremlin),"My question has to do with continuity requirements for functions used to define a Lebesge-Stieltjes measure on $\mathbb{R}$ .  In Fremlin's first volume of Measure Theory , the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by considering half-open intervals of the form $[a,b)=\{x:a\leq x<b\}$ . The length $\lambda I$ of a half-open interval $I$ is defined by setting $$\lambda\varnothing = 0,\quad \lambda[a,b)=b-a\text{ if }a<b.$$ From there, the Lebesgue outer-measure $\theta:2^\mathbb{R}\to[0,\infty]$ is defined in the usual way by setting \begin{align*}
\theta A= \inf\bigg\{\sum_{j=0}^\infty \lambda I_j:\langle I_j\rangle_{j\in\mathbb{N}}\text{ is a sequence of half-open intervals} \\ \text{such that } A\subseteq\bigcup_{j\in\mathbb{N}} I_j\bigg\}
\end{align*} for any $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ . (Above, half-open specifically means open on the right and closed on the left.) One of the exercises in the book replaces $\lambda$ in the above definition with $\lambda_g$ , where $g\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary non-decreasing function and $$\lambda_g\varnothing = 0,\quad\lambda_g[a,b)=\lim_{x\to b^-}g(x)-\lim_{x\to a^-} g(x)\text{ if }a<b.$$ The corresponding outer measure is denoted $\theta_g$ in the textbook. A subsequent question asks what happens if we were to naively define $\lambda_g[a,b)=g(b)-g(a)$ . I understand that in the first case, we still have a legitimate outer measure whose collection of measurable sets contains all Borel sets. Is it true that the same holds for the second case as well? I couldn't find much that would change, except in the second case, we would no longer have $\lambda_g I=\theta_g I$ for any half-open interval $I$ . If this is true, and the naive definition still defines a legitimate outer measure on $\mathbb{R}$ , is there any context in which the naive definition is worth studying (even if $g$ is not left-hand continuous)?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'outer-measure']"

If needed, we may also assume that all variables are positively correlated with each other, and that they are each marginally distributed as bernoulli coin flips.

I am talking about the 3d shape with 6 rectangular faces shown below. However, when looking up the name of this shape, I get confusing results.

While mathematical literature refers to any such polyhedron as a cuboid, 1 other sources use ""cuboid"" to refer to a shape of this type in which each of the faces is a rectangle The wikipedia page cites Polytopes and symmetry by Robertson, Stewart Alexander for this fact, even thought it contradicts many other geometry textbooks.

3476823,Is a Bundle whose Fibers are Homeomorphic a Fiber Bundle?,"To avoid problems with the notoriously inconsistent notation/formalisms of geometry, I will define bundles and fiber bundles (as I call them) below: We define a bundle $E \xrightarrow{\pi} B \ $ as a triplet $(E, B, \pi)$ with $E, B$ topological spaces and $\pi: E \to B$ a continuous surjection. We further define the fiber at $x \in B$ as the set $\pi^{-1}(\{x\})$ . A Fiber bundle is a 4-tuple $(E, B, F, \pi)$ with $E, B, F$ topological spaces, $\pi: E \to B$ a continuous surjection, together with a local trivialization $\{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}$ , where $\{U_i\}$ is an open cover of $B$ and $\varphi_i: \pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i \times F$ is a homeomorphism such that $\text{proj}_1 \circ \varphi_i \equiv \pi \ $ on $\ \pi^{-1}(U_i)$ . Now, in a lecture series on differential geometry that I am watching, bundles were defined in much the same way except that topological spaces were replaced by topological manifolds. No complaints here. However, a fiber bundle was subsequently defined as a bundle $E \xrightarrow{\pi} B \ $ such that all of the fibers $\pi^{-1}(\{x\})$ were homeomorphic to some common topological manifold $F$ —with no mention of the local triviality condition. My question is: In the case of topological manifolds, does this condition naturally induce the locally trivial condition that appeared before? Does it for general topological spaces? My intuition is that it does not for general topological spaces:
Clearly, there exists a family of homeomorphisms $\varphi_x: \pi^{-1}(\{x\}) \to \{x\} \times F$ , and for any $U \subset B$ , we can glue these maps together to obtain $\varphi_U: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times F$ defined point-wise by $\varphi_U(y) := \varphi_{\pi(y)}(y)$ . It's easy to see that this map is bijective independent of $U$ , but I see no reason to suspect bi-continuity even with ""nice"" choices in $U$ as—roughly speaking—we don't have any information about how this map behaves when moving transverse to the fibers. Perhaps this construction is too artificial, but it seemed compelling enough to me. In the case where the base space, total space, and common fiber are topological manifolds, I wouldn't be surprised if the chart maps could be used to construct a local trivialization but I'm not sure how to explicitly construct it at the moment.","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'fiber-bundles']"

Break $C$ into pieces using curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ ; here, $C_1$ has the parameterization $r(t) = \langle t, t^2\rangle$ where $t$ flows from $-1$ to $2$ , and $C_2$ has the parameterization $s(t) = \langle t, t+2\rangle$ where $t$ flows from $2$ to $-1$ .

3477189,Confusion About Area Distortion and Orientation of Ellipsoid,"Let $K = \{ (x,y,z) \mathbb{R}^3 | (\frac xa)^2 +(\frac yb)^2 +(\frac zc)^2 =1\}$ oriented by outward-pointing unit normal field. Consider $f(x,y,z) = ( \frac {ay}b, \frac{bz}c, \frac{cx}a)$ , $f: K \mapsto K$ . I am asked to show whether $f$ is orientation preserving or orientation reserving and for $a>b>c>0$ , want to find maximal $|| df_p||$ (area distortion). Area distortion is defined as $$\frac{|df_p(v_1) \times df_p(v_2)|}{|v_1 \times v_2|},$$ where $v_1,v_2$ is a basis of $K$ . My attempt: $$df_p = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0& \frac ac \\ \frac ba & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac cb & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ , $\det(df_p)=1$ for every $p$ . So it is orientation preserving, and since sign of determinant does not change with respect to basis we choose, it is orientation preserving. Furthermore since $df_p(v_1) \times df_p(v_2) = \det(df_p) ( v_1 \times v_2)$ , the area distortion does not change so every $p \in K$ is maximal and minimal. But I feel like there is something I am missing because I did not use outward-pointing unit normal field, and since area distortion is the same everywhere, there is no maximal. Is anything wrong with what I've done?","['solution-verification', 'differential-geometry']"
3477220,Which is the function that the zero-set of which is Möbius strip?,"Many surfaces can be expressed by implicit functions .
As described later, the spherical surface, the side surface of the cylinder, and the torus can be expressed by implicit functions. However, I have never seen the implicit function of Möbius strip. As will be explained later, the parametrization of the Torus and Möbius strip seems very similar form. 【My Question】: Can  Möbius strip  (or ""Joint-around-portion removed version of Möbius strip""†) be expressed by implicit function? If possible, which is the function that the zero-set of which is Möbius strip (or ""Joint-around-portion removed version of Möbius strip"" †) ? †. Here, the ""Joint-around-portion removed version of Möbius strip"" represent the surface created by removing a narrow closed set near the joint from Möbius strip so as to be diffeomorphic to closed rectangle.
For example, with ε> 0 as a small fixed constant, replace the domain of u in Box 2 with $0 \le u \le 2\pi - \epsilon$ I do not know much about whether the manifold, which is not orientable, can be expressed as a zero set of some functions. But, above-mantioned ""Joint-around-portion removed version of Möbius strip"" is topologically the closed rectangle (therefore closed and orientable) and 'almost' Möbius strip. Many surfaces can be expressed by implicit functions.
The spherical surface is the zero set of following ${f}_{suf}$ , $${f}_{suf}(x,y,z)={x}^{2} + {y}^{2} +{z}^{2} -1 $$ The side-surfaxe of cylinder is the zero set of following $f_sils$ , and $$f_{sils}={x}^{2} + {y}^{2} -1$$ When $R \ge r >0 $ , the Torus defined by following parametrization is the zero set of following ${f}_{torus,R,r}$ $${f}_{torus,R,r} = \left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}-R\right)^2 + z^2 = r^2 .$$ The parametrization of above-mentioned Torus is: Box.1 (A Parametrization of  Torus, quoted with minor modification from the wikipedia ) $$\begin{align}
x(\theta, \varphi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \cos{\varphi}\\
y(\theta, \varphi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \sin{\varphi}\\
z(\theta, \varphi) &= r \sin \theta
\end{align}$$ where θ, φ are angles which make a full circle, so that their values start and end at the same point, R is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, r is the radius of the tube. The constant value $R$ and $r$ shall be $R \ge r >0 $ The parametrization of Torus looks to me very similar to that of Möbius strip. As described in Wikipedia, one way to represent the Möbius strip as a subset of three-dimensional Euclidean space is using following parametrization: Box.2 (A Parametrization of Möbius strip quoted from the Wikipedia with minor modification.) $$x(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos \frac{u}{2}\right)\cos u$$ $$y(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos\frac{u}{2}\right)\sin u$$ $$z(u,v)= \frac{v}{2}\sin \frac{u}{2}$$ where, $0 \le u< 2\pi$ , and, $-1 \le v\le 1$ . This creates a Möbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1, lies in the $xy$ -plane and is centered at $(0, 0, 0)$ . The parameter $u$ runs around the strip while $v$ moves from one edge to the other. The parametrization of the Torus and Möbius strip look same to me (If $R = 1$ , $r=v/2$ ,the essential difference is what is considered as a variable and what is considered as a constant.) Therefore, I think that Möbius strip(or almost part of Möbius strip)  be  expressed implicitly, by following fuctuion. $${f}_{torus,1,v/2} = \left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}-1\right)^2 + z^2 = (\frac{v}{2} )^2 $$ Try the slimier manner of 1578756 First  plug in $\;z=z(u,v) = \frac{v}{2}\sin(u/2) $ to ${f}_{torus,1,v/2}(x,y,z)$ to get $$\left(1-\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right)^2+{(v/2)}^2\sin^{2} (u/2)={(v/2)}^{2} ,$$ which is $$\left(1-\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right)^{2}={(v/2)}^{2}(1-\sin^{2}(v/2)).$$ The last expression can also be written as $$\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-1\right)^2={(v/2)}^{2}(1-\sin^{2}(v/2))={(v/2)}^{2}(\cos^{2}(v/2)).$$ Clear away squares and rearrange to obtain $$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1+(v/2)\cos\theta,$$ or $$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=1-(v/2)\cos\theta,$$ and from this you get $$\;x^2+y^2=(1+(v/2)\cos\theta)^2,$$ or $$\;x^2+y^2=(1-(v/2)\cos\theta)^2,$$ or Perhaps it seems to be necessary to distinguish between positive and negative values  of v / 2. 
But I think this seems to be a natural. I forcibly separated the Mobius strip into front-side and back-side.
It seems difficult to obtain θ geometrically unlike the torus. So, I'll divide the question of implicit function of catted out version of Mobius strip, later. P.S. I'm not very good at English, so I'm sorry if I have some impolite or unclear expressions.

I mean, if $s \in O_X(X)$ with $s_x=0 \in O_{X,x}$ for some $x$ then $s$ vanishes on some open set which is dense, and if my claim is true then it is zero.

If $X = \operatorname{Spec}A$ for $A$ some integral ring, then a non-zero global section is never going to vanish at some stalk since $A$ integral means $A$ contains no non-zero zero-divisors, so $A$ injects in $A_p$ .

I hope that all such subgroups are conjugate to each other, but so far I haven't had any success with showing this. Frankly, I do not yet know for sure whether or not this is true, but I believe it to be true for $p = 5$ and $p = 7$ , which I hope is not just a coincidence. To be even more precise, I would hope that $N_G(H) / Z(G) \cong \text{Aut}(H)$ , where $G=\text{GL}_2(p)$ and $N_G(H)$ is the normaliser of $H$ in $G$ and $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$ . I have already proved that the centraliser of $H$ is given precisely by the center of $G$ . The proof used the fact that $H$ is not abelian and that we are working with $2 \times 2$ matrices. The group $H$ has an element of order 6, so I figured a good start would be to show that all elements in $\text{SL}_2(p)$ that have order 6 are conjugate to each other (which again seems to be true for small primes), but I have not yet succeeded in doing this either. Assuming this for a moment, a natural choice for this element of order 6 would be the matrix $
a = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}

The $n$ -th digit of $Z$ is said to be equal to one if $X_n = b$ , and to zero if $X_n =a$ . All real numbers in $[\frac{a}{1-a}, \frac{b}{1-b}]$ can be uniquely represented in this form ( uniquely is to be understood in the same sense that the traditional binary representation of a number is ""unique"".) A simple algorithm can be used to compute the digits of $Z$ . See below its coded version (in Perl). Note that $a, b$ are represented by $alpha, $beta in the program. The variable $sum is used to double check that the computations were successful, and give you some idea of how many digits can be accurately computed: it converges to $Z$ , and represents the successive approximations of $Z$ using an increasing number of terms in the formula at the very beginning of this article. open(OUT,"">att.txt""); $beta=sqrt(2)/2;

close(OUT); My Question : Is there a simple expression or recursion that maps the digit of $Z$ in base two, to its digits in the system discussed here? Of course there is a one-to-one mapping: if you know the digits in one system, then compute $Z$ , then compute the digits back into the other system. But I am looking at something smarter than that, also hoping to find patterns between the two representations (digits) of a number $Z$ in both systems. Fun facts In the case $a=-0.5, b=0.5$ (not covered here) the one-to-one mapping between the two digit systems (mine versus standard binary) is described in section 5 in this article . Also, if you pick up a number at random in $[\frac{a}{1-a}, \frac{b}{1-b}]$ , then in my system, the proportion of digits equal to 1, is $b$ . By contrast, in the standard binary system, that proportion is 50%. In both systems, successive digits are not auto-correlated (true for the immense majority of numbers, called normal numbers .) Finally, consider the $X_i$ 's as independent random variables with distribution $P(X_i = b) = b, P(X_i = a) =a$ . Remember that $a+b =1$ and $0< a < b < 1$ . Then $Z$ has a uniform distribution on $[\frac{a}{1-a}, \frac{b}{1-b}]$ . If $a+b < 1$ , then the support domain for $Z$ is full of wholes, and $Z$ 's distribution is nowhere differentiable; it does not have a density. Yet it has a distribution and you can compute all its moments. See here for more on this topic. The case $P(X_i = b) = p,P(X_i = a) = 1-p$ , with $p \neq b$ can also lead to a very wild distribution for $Z$ . See chart below, picturing the empirical percentile distribution of $Z$ , if $a=0.4, b=0.6, p =0.8$ . It corresponds to a no-where differentiable distribution. If instead $p=0.6$ , the curve becomes a straight line, corresponding to a uniform distribution. Potential application You can encode a message using the new numeration system proposed here. However, if you use (say) $b=0.6$ , it will be very obvious to the hacker that you used $0.6$ since about 60% of the digits will be equal to one. The hacker will then easily decode your message. But you could pepper the encoded message with a number of digits equal to zero, at specific locations, to reduce the proportion of digits equal to one, from 60% to 50%. Then the hacker won't know which $b$ you used, and won't be able to easily decrypt your message. You need to make sure that when adding zero's, you do it in such a way that the correlation between successive digits remains equal to zero. I am also curious to see what happens when $b\rightarrow 0.5$ or $b\rightarrow 1$ . I also plan on investigating the case $b=3/4$ , or more generally, $b$ a rational number, in more details, and I will provide an update if I find something interesting.","['number-theory', 'binary', 'probability-theory', 'sequences-and-series']"

3478031,Close-form for integral $T(n)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{1}{1+\sin^n(x)}dx$,"Context: I have recently become interested in integrals of the form $$T(n)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{1+\sin(x)^n},$$ and I conjecture that $T(n)$ has a closed form evaluation for all $n\in\Bbb Z_{\ge0}$ , or at least all non-negative even integers $n$ . Trivially, one has $T(0)=\pi/4$ . Less trivially, there is $T(1)=1$ (easy with $t=\tan(x/2)$ ), and $T(2)=\frac\pi{2\sqrt{2}}$ as seen here . The integral $J=T(3)$ , however, is not so easy.
We see that this integral is $$3J=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{1+\sin x}-\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\sin (x)dx}{\sin(x)^2-\sin(x)+1}+2\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{\sin(x)^2-\sin(x)+1}.$$ The first integral is easy, and we get $$3J=1-J_1+J_2.$$ The next integral is $$J_1=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\sin (x)dx}{\sin(x)^2-\sin(x)+1},$$ which is, from $t=\tan(x/2)$ , $$J_1=2\int_0^1\frac{\frac{2t}{1+t^2}}{(\frac{2t}{1+t^2})^2-\frac{2t}{1+t^2}+1}\frac{dt}{1+t^2},$$ which is the awful $$J_1=4\int_0^1\frac{tdt}{t^4-2t^3+6t^2-2t+1}.$$ I found that nothing but brute force could tackle this integral, so I used partial fractions and got $$J_1=4\sum_{a\in A}\frac{1}{f'(a)}\left(1+a\log(1-a)-a\log(-a)\right)$$ where $$A=\left\{\frac12\left(1+p_1i\sqrt3+p_2\sqrt{-6+2p_3i\sqrt3}\right):p_1,p_2,p_3\in\{-1,1\}\right\}$$ is the set of roots of the polynomial $f(z)=z^4-2z^3+6z^2-2z+1,$ and $\log(z)$ is the complex logarithm. However, the remaining integral is a little worse. We have from the substitution $t=\tan(x/2)$ the awful $$J_2=4\int_0^1\frac{1+t^2}{1-2t+5t^2-2t^3}dt.$$ We can do the same sort of trick here as with the last integral and get $$J_2=4\sum_{b\in B}\frac1{g'(b)}\int_0^1\frac{t^2+1}{t-b}dt$$ where $$B=\{z\in\Bbb C: 1-2z+5z^2-2z^3=0\}$$ is the set of roots of the polynomial $g(z)=1-2z+5z^2-2z^3$ . These roots do indeed have explicit evaluations . The integral in the summation is easy enough to calculate, but I'm not going to, as we already see that the integral has a closed form. Next up, Wolfram evaluates $$T(4)=\int_0^1\frac{dx}{1+\sin(x)^4}=\frac\pi4\sqrt{1+\sqrt2},$$ as well as $$T(6)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{dx}{1+\sin(x)^6}=\frac{\pi}{12}(\sqrt{2}+2\sqrt{3}),$$ which is here . In fact, we may evaluate $T(2n)$ in terms of hypergeometric functions, which may have a general closed form. We do so by noting that $$\frac{1}{1+\sin(x)^{2n}}=\sum_{k\ge0}(-1)^k\sin(x)^{2nk}$$ so that $$T(2n)=\sum_{k\ge0}(-1)^k\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(x)^{2nk}dx=\frac{\sqrt\pi}{2}\sum_{k\ge0}(-1)^k\frac{\Gamma(nk+\tfrac12)}{(nk)!}.$$ This is $$T(2n)=\frac\pi2\,_{n}F_{n-1}\left(1-\tfrac{1}{2n},A_n;B_n;-1\right)$$ where $$\begin{align}
A_n&=\left\{\frac{2r+1}{2n}:0\le r\in\Bbb Z\le n-2\right\}\\
B_n&=\left\{\frac{r}{n}:1\le r\in\Bbb Z\le n-1\right\}.
\end{align}$$ Whether or not this hypergeometric has a closed form I am unsure, but it looks simple enough to be evaluated exactly. Questions: Can $T(n)$ be computed in closed form of all $n$ ? If not, when can it be computed in closed form? And at the very least, what is $T(5)$ ? It seems to be very nasty.

3478071,Generically transversally intersecting Schubert cycles,"I have a question about the the proof of Pieri's formula from Harris' and Eisenbuds's lecture ""3264 and All That"" on page 146. Before the proof we use this terminology (see page 139): let $G=G(k,V)$ be the Grassmannian of $k$ -dimensional linear
  subspaces of an $n$ -dimensional vector space $V$ . We start with one useful definition. As
  we said, Kleiman’s theorem assures us (in characteristic $0$ ) that, for a general pair of
  flags $\mathcal{V}= 0=V_0 \subset V_1 \subset ... \subset V_n=V$ and $\mathcal{W}$ on $V$ , the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_a(\mathcal{V}),\Sigma_b(\mathcal{W})$ intersect generically transversely. Recall, these Schubert cycles are defined as follows: Let $n-k \ge a_1 \ge a_2 \ge ... \ge a_k \ge 0$ a descending sequence considered as vector $a=(a_1,...,a_k)$ . Then $$\Sigma_a(\mathcal{V}):= \{\Lambda \in G \vert \dim(\Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-a_i}) \ge i \text{ for all } i \}$$ In this case, we can actually say explicitly what “general” means: Definition 4.4 . We say that a pair of flags $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ on $V$ are transverse if any of the
  following equivalent conditions hold: (a) $V_i \cap W_{n-i} =0$ for all $i$ . (b) $\dim(V_i \cap W_{n-i})= \min(0, i +j-n)$ for all $i, j$ . (c) There exists a basis $e_1,...,e_n$ for $V$ in terms of which $$V_i =\langle e_1,...,e_i \rangle \text{ and } W_j =\langle e_{n+1-j},...,e_n \rangle$$ Additionally, we will use: Lemma 4.5 Let $\Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}), \Sigma_b (\mathcal{W}) \subset G$ be Schubert cycles defined relative to transverse
  flags V and W on V . If $\Lambda \in \Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}) \cap \Sigma_b (\mathcal{W})$ is a general point of their intersection,
  then: (a) $\Lambda$ does not lie in any strictly smaller Schubert cycle $ \Sigma_{a'} (\mathcal{V}) \subset \Sigma_a (\mathcal{V})$ . (b) The flags induced by $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ on $\Lambda$ (that is, consisting of intersections with $\Lambda$ with
flag elements $V_{\alpha}$ and $ W_{\beta}$ ) are transverse.
Note that, by the first part, the flags $\Lambda^{\mathcal{V}}$ and $\Lambda^{\mathcal{W}}$ on $\Lambda$ induced by $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are,
explicitly, $$\Lambda^{\mathcal{V}}_i= \Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-a_i}$$ and $$\Lambda^{\mathcal{W}}_i= \Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-b_i}$$ for $i=1,...,k$ . now Proposition 4.9 (Pieri’s formula). For any Schubert class $\sigma_a \in A(G) $ (the latter is the Chow Group) and any integer $b$ , $$(\sigma_b \cdot \sigma_a)= \sum_{\vert c \vert= \vert a \vert + b \text{ & } a_i \le c_i \le a_{i-1}}$$ Proof of 4.9 (Pieri's formula): [...] following the book we look at Schubert cycles $\Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}), \Sigma_b (\mathcal{U})$ and $\Sigma_{c^*}(\mathcal{W})$ defined with respect general flags $\mathcal{V},\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}$ . Recall that $c^*=(c^*_1,c^*_2,..., c^*_k$ is the dual vector to $c$ defined by $c^*_i:= n-k -c_{k+1-i}$ . By definition, $$\Sigma_a(\mathcal{V})= \{\Lambda \vert \dim(\Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-a_i}) \ge i \text{ for all } i \}$$ and $$\Sigma_{c^*}(\mathcal{W})= \{\Lambda \vert \dim(\Lambda \cap W_{i+c_{k+1-i}}) \ge i \text{ for all } i \}$$ Set $$A_i = V_{n-k+i-a_i} \cap W_{k+1-i-c_i}$$ . During the proof we define $A:= \langle A_1,...,A_k \rangle$ and it is claimed that by Lemma 4.5 the plane $\Lambda$ is spanned by it's intersections with $A_i$ , i.e. that $\Lambda =\langle \Lambda \cap A_i \vert i \rangle$ .

Prove the estimate for every $t\in (0,1)$ $$\|g_n^\prime(t)\|\leq \frac{1}{n!}M\|th\|^n\|h\|.$$ Use it to deduce $\|g_n(1)-g_n(0)\|\leq \frac{1}{(n+1)!}M\|h\|^{n+1}$ as desired. Given the estimate on $g^\prime _n$ I know how to get the second inequality. However, I don't see how to prove this first estimate.

3478234,Atlas for the closed ball.,"Consider the manifold with boundary $$D:= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \Vert x \Vert  \leq 1\}$$ I want to calculate $$\int_D dx \wedge dy$$ using the definition of the integral. The integral is defined this way in my book: Assume we have a manifold $M$ of dimension $m$ . We will define $\int_M
 \omega$ where $\omega$ is a compactly supported $m$ -form (i.e. $\operatorname{supp}(\omega) := \overline{\{p \in M\mid \omega(p) \neq
 0\}}$ is compact) (Step 1): Assume $\operatorname{supp}(\omega) \subseteq U$ for some
  chart $(U, \phi)$ . Write $$(\phi^{-1})^*(\omega) = f dx_1 \land \dots
 \land dx_m \in \Omega(\phi(U))$$ where $f \in C^\infty(\phi(U))$ .
  Define $$\int_M \omega := \int_{\phi(U)}f$$ where the right integral is an ordinary Riemann-integral. (Step 2): Involves a partition of unity to define the general case and
  I don't think it is important here so I'll ommit it. I want to use this definition to calculate the above integral, so the first issue I'm stumbling upon. What is an atlas for $D$ ? I guess, I can just consider the map $id_D: D \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and this is an atlas for $D$ ? My confusion is the following: Formally, a chart is a map $U \to V$ where $V$ is an open in some $\mathbb{R}^n$ or some $\mathbb{H}^n$ , so aren't there actually two charts involved (one for the interior, another for the boundary?) If I can just pick the identity as one chart, then $$\int_D dx \land dy := \int_D dxdy = \pi$$ Any advice?","['integration', 'manifolds-with-boundary', 'stokes-theorem', 'differential-geometry']"

3478773,Geometric yet rigorous motivation for the definition of the surface measure,"Let $M \subset \mathbb{E}^n$ be a submanifold, $\dim M = m$ . Then $M$ inherits Riemannian structure from the Euclidean space. Consider the $\sigma$ -algebra induced by the Lebesgue measurable sets and the parametrizations. The surface measure on $M$ is defined as: $$\sigma(A) = \int_{r^{-1}(A)} \sqrt{\det[g_{ij}]} d\lambda_m ~~~~~~(*) $$ where $g_{ij} = \langle\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_i}\mid\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_j} \rangle$ , i.e. $[g_{ij}] = (Dr)^T (Dr)$ is the Gram matrix of $Dr$ or, in other words, the determinant of the inherited Riemann metric tensor. For simplicity, we assume here that the set $A$ lies within the image of a single local parametrization $r$ . This definition was motivated in a rather sloppy way: Take a parametrization $r$ around $p \in M$ such that $r(0) = p$ . Take a small hypercube $K \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ having $0$ as one of its vertices. Then the image $r(K)$ will approximately be a parallelogram contained in $TM_p$ , with its sides parallel to the vectors $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x_i} \in TM_p$ , whose volume is $\sqrt{\det g_{ij}} \lambda_m(K)$ . Therefore, we define the measure as above. I'm not convinced by an argument like this. It's completely unclear that the error of such approximation will ever converge to 0. Keep in mind that naive triangulation doesn't work - recall the Schwarz lantern. Moreover, the approximation error is not quantified at all. I do agree that we only need to argue that the equality holds on images of hypercubes, as they form a generating set for the $\sigma$ -algebra, so by the $\pi-\lambda$ lemma we'll get uniqueness of the measure satisfying $(*)$ for images of hypercubes. Are there any different ways in which the surface measure is unique? Are there any limit constructions which justify the name surface area for a 2-dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{E}^3$ ? Can we justify the geometric meaning of the surface measure in a more rigorous way?","['manifolds', 'measure-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
