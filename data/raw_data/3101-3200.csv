21957,dy/dx when x and y are functions,"Let $x$ and $y$ be continuously differentiable real-valued functions defined on $\mathbf{R}$ and suppose that $x'(t) = f\,(x(t),y(t))$ and $y'(t) = g(x(t),y(t))$ where $f$ and $g$ are continuously differentiable on $\mathbf{R}^2$. According to the ODE book I am reading, if $f$ is never 0, then 
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{g(x,y)}{f(x,y)}
\]
\[
y(x_0) = y_0 
\]
where $x_0,y_0$ are constants, is an initial value problem. Now what does $dy/dx$ mean here? Is it just the function $y'(x)$? Or is the author being sloppy and $x$ is actually a dummy variable? If the former is true, how is this an initial value problem? Normally, an initial value problem is given as $y'(t) = h(y(t),t)$, $y(t_0) = y_0$ where $t$ is variable. PS. Why is it that ODE books are sloppy with notation and unshamefully nonrigorous?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

21966,The limit (and function) changes after rationalizing?,"I want to evaluate the following:
$$\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\frac{-r^2}{2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{4}}-1 \right)}$$ I look at the graph and see that it seems to be going to zero. This makes sense to me because if I replace r with zero this function is defined and continuous near zero and the value of the function is zero. So, I think:
$$\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\frac{-r^2}{2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{4}}-1 \right)}=0$$ But next I try something else I rationalize the denominator since this is a good technique for solving limits.
$$\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\frac{-r^2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{4}}+1 \right)}{2 \left(1-\frac{r^2}{4}-1 \right)}$$ Then,
$$\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\frac{-r^2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{4}}+1 \right)}{\frac{-r^2}{2}}$$
so...
$$\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} 2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{2}}+1 \right)=4$$ What have I done? How can rationalizing change the graph? My guess is that the denominator $2 \left(\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{2}}-1 \right)$ is ""divisible by $r^2$ in some not obvious way?

21969,Can the sums of two sequences of reciprocals of consecutive integers be equal?,"I'm primarily a programmer, so forgive me if I don't know the proper nomenclature or notation. Last night, an old teacher of mine told me about a question that had caused some noodle-scratching for him: For any two sequences of consecutive integers, can the sums of their reciprocals be equal? Now, I gather that these sums are called ""harmonic numbers"" if the consecutive sequence begins with 1.  But what if it doesn't begin with 1? How might we go about proving that for any two such sequences, their sums are unequal? I have written a quick Python script that returns, in the form of a reduced fraction, the sum of any $\sigma(m, k)$ where $m$ is the first number to consider and $k$ is the length of the sequence. So, I guess I have two questions: 1) Where can I find out about the current state of research on this question? 2) What are the most likely approaches, or ""hooks"" that I might grasp onto to arrive at a proof? (Via the comments, I'll add the following for clarity:) $\sigma(m,k)$ is $\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{m+1}+\dots +\frac{1}{m+k−1}.$ My question is: Can there exist distinct pairs $(m_1,k_1)$ and $(m_2,k_2)$ such that the corresponding sums are equal?","['egyptian-fractions', 'number-theory']"
21973,Class of sets of a given infinite cardinality,"This question was inspired by the question on examples of classes that are not sets . From the discussion in the comments there, it seems there does not exist a set of all sets of a given cardinality. To me, it seems easy to see that this is true for any nonzero finite cardinality $n$. Given any set $x$, you can always make a set of size $n$ by adding $n-1$ other sets to $x$ to make a set of size $n$, which exists by repeated use of the pairing axiom. But how would you do this for infinite cardinalities? For suppose $\kappa$ is some given infinite cardinality. To show that the set of all sets of cardinality $\kappa$ does not exist, it seems you would have to show that for any set $x$, there exists a set of that size with $x$ as an element, and then you could take the union of that set to find the set of all sets, and thus a contradiction. But it doesn't seem reasonable to simply say, for a given set of size $\kappa$ if $x$ is in the set, we have no problem. If not, just take an element out of the set and put $x$ in. Something about that seems like it would not be allowed. So how would you do this for infinite cardinalities?",['elementary-set-theory']

If a variety $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n(\mathbb{Q}^{alg})$ has infinitely many points, must it have infinitely many points of bounded degree?

22004,Questions about product measure,"On Planetmath , product measure
is roughly defined as follows: Let $(E_i, \mathbb{B}_i, u_i)$ be
measure spaces, where $i\in I$ an
index set, possibly infinite. When each $u_i$ is totally finite,
there is a unique measure on the
product measurable space $(E,
\mathbb{B})$ of $(E_i, \mathbb{B}_i,
u_i)$ . such that ""taking measure""
and ""taking product"" can be
""exchanged"" for any $B=\prod_{i \in
I} B_i$ with $B_i \in \mathbb{B_i}$ and $B_i=E_i$ for all $i \in I$ except on a finite subset $J$ of $I$ . I was wondering if there is also a
unique measure on the product
measurable space, such that ""taking
measure"" and ""taking product"" can be
""exchanged"" for any $B=\prod_{i \in
I} B_i$ with $B_i \in \mathbb{B_i}$ ,
without requiring "" $B_i=E_i$ for all $i \in I$ except on a finite subset $J$ of $I$ ""? This is not used in the
definition of product measure, and is
it only because the product might be for
infinite number of terms? If $I$ is infinite, one sees that the
total finiteness of $u_i$ can not be
dropped. For example, if $I$ is the
set of positive integers, assume $u_1(E_1) < \infty$ and $u_2(E_2)=\infty$ . Then $u(B)$ for $$B:=B_1 \times \prod_{i>1} E_i=B_1\times E_2 \times \prod_{i>2} E_i,$$ where $B_1 \in \mathbb{B}_1$ would not be
well-defined (on the one hand, it is $u_1(B_1)<\infty$ , but on the other
it is $u_1(B_1)u_2(E_2)=\infty$ ). I don't understand the example.

sigma    algebras on their domains
also the    same? Is the range of each component random    variable the component
space in the    cartesian product

I understand correctly, given a
random vector, the probability
measure induced on the range (which

probability measure of the random
vector. The probability measure
induced on the component space of
the range by each component of
the random vector, is called the
marginal probability measure of the
component random variable of the

a random vector being
independent. I read from a webpage that it is said so when the joint probability measure is the product measure of the individual marginal probability measures.

22071,"Simultaneous equations, trig functions and the existence of solutions","Came across this conundrum while going over the proof that
$$A \cdot \sin(bx) + B \cdot \cos(bx) = C \cdot \sin(bx + k)$$
for some numbers $C$ and $k$. ($A$, $B$ and $b$ are known.) The usual method is to expand the RHS using the compound angle identity
\begin{align}
C \cdot \sin(bx + k) &= C \cdot \bigl( \sin(bx)\cos(k) + \cos(bx)\sin(k) \bigl) \\
&= C\cos(k) \cdot \sin(bx) + C\sin(k) \cdot \cos(bx)

$$ \tan(k) = \frac{B}{A} $$
which we then solve to obtain $k$, etc. etc. My question is: how do we know that this is ""legal""? We have reduced the original two-equation system to a single equation. How do we know that the values of $k$ that satisfy the single equation are equal to the solution set of the original system? While thinking about this I drew up this other problem:
\begin{align}
\text{Find all }x\text{ such that} \\
\sin(x) &= 1 \\
\cos(x) &= 1
\end{align} Obviously this system has no solutions ($\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are never equal to $1$ simultaneously). But if we apply the same method we did for the earlier example, we can say that since $\sin(x) = 1$ and $\cos(x) = 1$, let's divide $1$ by $1$ and get
$$ \tan(x) = 1 $$

22155,Boundedness of the Christoffel symbols of a connection on the normal bundle [closed],"This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet. For help making this question more broadly applicable, visit the help center . Closed 13 years ago . I have the following setting: Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold and $\iota: M \to R^N$ some isometric embedding. This means especially that the connection $\nabla^{TM}$ of M is given by the ordinary Euklidean connection $\nabla$ on R^N composed with the projection on the subbundle TM of TR^N. I also have the normal bundle NM of M and can equip it with the via $\iota$ pulled back metric and connection. Now I want to bound the Christoffel symbols (and its derivatives) of $\nabla^{NM}$ by the Christoffel symbols of $\nabla^{TM}$ and also bound the entries of the projection matrices $p_{TM}: R^N \to TM$ and $p_{NM}: R^N \to NM$. And vice versa. For the computation of $\Gamma^{TM}$ I use Riemannian normal coordinates $\partial_{x_i}$. For the computation of $\Gamma^{NM}$ I take an orthonormal basis ${n_i}$ of NM at a point p and then parallel translate it along the radial geodesics of the Riemannian normal coordinate system. The entries of the projections I want to compute with respect to the standard coordinates $e_i$ of R^N. I have the following: Let $g_{ij}$ and $h_{ij}$ be the local expressions for the metrics g and h (w.r.t. the frame $\partial_{x_i}$, resp. $n_i$) and let $g^{ij}$ and $h^{ij}$ be the inverse matrices. Then the projections are given by $p_{TM}(v) = g^{kl} \langle v, \partial_{x_l} \rangle \partial_{x_k}$ and analogously for $p_{NM}$. Then the Christoffel symbols are given by $\Gamma_{ij}^{k, TM} = g^{kl} \langle \nabla_{\partial_{x_i}} \partial_{x_j}, \partial_{x_l}\rangle$ and analogously for $\Gamma_{ij}^{k, NM}$ and the entries of the projection metrices are $(p_{TM})_{ij} = g^{kl} \langle e_j, \partial_{x_l}\rangle \langle e_i, \partial_{x_k}\rangle$ and analogously for $(p_{NM})_{ij}$. Now if I suppose that all the $\Gamma_{ij}^{k, TM}$ are bounded as are all their derivatives, I do not see how to show the boundedness of the $(p_{TM})_{ij}$ and their derivatives. And even if somehow could show this, I don't see how to show then the bundedness of the $\Gamma_{ij}^{k, NM}$ and their derivatives. Motivation for the whole question: A Riemannian manifold has bounded geometry, if the metric is complete, the injectivity radius positive and the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives are uniformly bounded. One can show that this is equivalent to the statement, that the Christoffel symbols and its derivates are all uniformly bounded when computed in Riemannian normal coordinates (where the radii of all the coordinate balls are fixed). A bundle over a Riemannian manifold equipped with a connection has bounded geometry, if its curvature tensor and all its covariant derivatives are bounded. Here one can also show that this is equivalent to the statement, that the Christoffel symbols and its derivatives are uniformly bounded, when computed in such a frame as above (parallel translation of an orthonormal basis at a point along radial geodesics). Now I want to show, that if a Riemannian manifold has bounded geometry, its normal bundle (w.r.t. some isometric embedding into some R^N) has also bounded geometry. And I am also interested in a formulation of this via the entries of the projection matrices. Thanks,

What is the fix group in $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^n) = PGL(n)$ of $\omega_X$? 2) In Remark 7.12.1 it is shown that Serre duality implies that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ we have that $H^n(X,\omega_X) \cong k$.

Prove that $\lim_n(\sup\{\Vert T_n x\Vert:x\in K\})=0$ on any compact set $K\subset X$. As far as I can see, the fact that $T_n$ attains it's maximum on $K$ for any $n$ is not enough to prove this one, since it is possible that there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that for any $N$ $\exists n>N$ such that $\Vert T_nx\Vert>\epsilon$ for some $x\in K$, and diminishes to 0 later on.

I think this induces a fiber bundle $E'$ over $B$ with fiber $C(F,\mathbb C)$, the C*-algebra of continuous functions on $F$, and with structure group $\mathrm{Aut}(C(F,\mathbb C))\cong\mathrm{Homeo}(F)$, the group of *-automorphisms of $C(F,\mathbb C)$. (To be more explicit about what happens here: my idea is: take a covering of $B$ which trivialises $E$. The transition functions give me a cocycle with values in the structure group $\mathrm{Homeo}(F)$. But, since $\mathrm{Homeo}(F)\cong\mathrm{Aut}(C(F,\mathbb C))$, I get a cocycle with values in $\mathrm{Aut}(C(F,\mathbb C))$, which I'd like to use to glue my new bundle.)

Example: If $E\cong B\times F$ is the trivial bundle, then $E'\cong B\times C(F,\mathbb C)$ and thus
$$\Gamma(B,E')\cong C(B,C(F,\mathbb C))\cong C(B\times F,\mathbb C).$$

22472,Nested sequences of balls in a Banach space,"This seems to be a fairly easy question but I'm looking for new points of view on it and was wondering if anyone might be able to help. (By the way- this question does come from home-work, but I've already solved and handed it, and I'm posting this out of interest, so no HW tag.) Let $B_n=B(x_n,r_n)$ be a sequence of nested closed balls in a Banach space $X$. Prove that $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B_n\neq\varnothing$. As I said before, it should be rather simple. When the radii decrease to 0, it's just a matter of selecting any sequence of points in $B_n$, and it must be Cauchy- and the limit is in the intersection. My question is what to do when the radii do not decrease to 0? I got some tips about multiplying the balls by a sequence of decreasing scalars, or reducing the radii so that they decrease to 0, but found too many pathological cases for both methods. Finally- I used a geometric arguemnt (which i've shown to work in any normed space) that if $B(x_1,r_1)\subset B(x_2,r_2)$ then $\| x_1-x_2\|\leq|r_1-r_2|$.

For evolving $\phi$ the derivation says to imagine a particle $\textbf{x}(t)$ on the surface, then we differentiate with respect to t $\frac{d}{dt}(\phi(\vec{x}, t)=0)$ Using chain rule we get $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \triangledown \phi \cdot \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = 0$ Then this equation is turned into $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \triangledown \phi \cdot \vec{V} = 0$ I guess $\vec{V}$ is the speed, and its elements are to replace $dx$, $dy$, .. that are elements of $d{\vec{x}}$. Hence we can substitute our own displacement and receive a result.

Let $A = \{1,2\}$ , $B = \{4\}$ , $C = \{5\}$ , $f(1) = 4$ ; $f(2) = 4$ $g\circ f(1) = 5$ and $g\circ f(2) = 5$ .

Of course, if $f$ is surjective, then taking $A=X$, one has $f(A)=B=Y$ and $g(Y-Y)=g(\emptyset)=\emptyset=X-X=X-A$, and you're done. So I suppose $f$ is not surjective. I tried to approach it by contradiction. It seems that for any $A\subseteq X$, there is obviously a $B\subseteq Y$ such that $f(A)=B$, so if the result is not the case, for each pair of subsets $A$ and $f(A)$, we must have $g(Y-f(A))\neq X-A$. Then for every $f(A)\subseteq Y$, there exists a $y\in Y-f(A)$ such that $g(y)\notin X-A$. This would imply $g(y)\notin X \lor g(y)\in A$, but since $g(y)\in X$, we must have $g(y)\in A$. The only thing I can glean from this is that $g$ is surjective, since for any singleton $\{x\}\subseteq X$, we could then find a $y\in Y-\{f(x)\}$ such that $g(y)=x$.
