790106,Does finite expectation imply bounded random variable?,"In general if I have that
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}(X)<\infty
\end{equation}
does this imply that $|X|<\infty$ a.s? An attempted proof: Let $(\Omega,\mathbb{F},\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $K>0$ be a constant, then
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}(X)=\int_{\Omega}XdP\,=\int_{\{|X|\leq K \}}XdP\,+\int_{\{|X|>K\}}XdP\, <\infty

Taking the limit as $K\rightarrow \infty$
\begin{equation}
\int_{\{|X|>K\}}XdP\, \rightarrow 0

790112,Hall's marriage Theorem and Tychonoff Theorem,I was reading this paper. In particular the second point. He proves the Hall's marriage Theorem for infinite family using the Tychonoff theorem on topological product of compact $T_2$ spaces and the Hall's marriage Theorem for finite family. So assume that $Y$ is an infinite family of finite sets such that any $k$ sets in $Y$ have at least $k$ elements in their union ($k$ is a finite number). We want to prove that there is a $1-1$ function $f:Y\longrightarrow \underset{X\in Y}{\cup}X$. Endow each $X\in Y$ with the discrete topology. Since $X$ is finite it is a compact $T_2$ space. The topological product $\underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ is a compact $T_2$ space. We now take the $F$ to be the family of all sets $S_G$ of all $f\in \underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ such that their restriction to $G$ is injective; for all $G$ finite subsets of $Y$. He claims that $S_G$ is closed and nonempty by the Hall's marriage theorem for finite family. I do not understand why. In particular I ask myself the following things: As matter the nonemptiness I was thinking of finding an injective function using Hall's marriage theorem for the finite family $G$ and then to extend to all $Y$. But how? How can we say that  $\underset{X\in Y}{\prod}X$ is not empty without using the full strenght of the Axiom of Choice? Where do we make (if we make) us of the fact that the product is a $T_2$ space? The closeness of $S_G$ just came from the fact that the projection onto the factor is a continuus function and that the antiimages of closed set is a closed set?,"['logic', 'set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice', 'combinatorics']"

790188,Nilpotent groups are monomial,"I'm trying to show that a nilpotent group $G$ is monomial; i.e., that every irreducible representation $\rho$ of $G$ satisfies $\rho = \text{Ind}_H^G(\tau)$ for some $H \leq G$, $\tau$ a one dimensional representation of $H$. So far I've proved the claim by induction on $\left|G\right|$ in the case where $\ker\rho \neq \{1\}$. However, when $\rho$ is faithful, I'm not entirely sure where I should go... I've also shown that if $G$ has a primitive faithful irreducible representation, then for any normal abelian subgroup $N \leq G$, we have $N \leq Z(G)$ and the question sheet gives the hint: ""any nilpotent group has a normal abelian self-centralising subgroup"" But I can't quite see how to tie these facts together and proceed. I know that we can pretty much reduce to the case of the representation being primitive by considering a minimal subgroup $H\leq G$ with the property that there exists $\tau \in \text{Irr}(H)$ with $\text{Ind}_H^G(\tau) = \rho$ - this $\tau$ is necessarily a primitive irreducible faithful representation of $H$.

790289,Argument Principle -Meaning of Derivative of Complex Logarithm,"Intuitively in the argument principle , why does the integral of the logarithmic derivative of a meromorphic function over a closed curve give the number of zeros minus the number of poles? 
My guess is that by writing $$\int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \ln[f(z)]dz = \int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \ln ( r(z)e^{i\theta (z)} ) dz =\int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \ln(r(z)) dz + i \int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \theta (z) dz$$ we see $\int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \ln(r(z)) dz = 0$ because $f$ has no zero's or poles on $\gamma$ so the total change of $r(z)$ is zero. Hence making sense of $ i \int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \theta (z) dz$ is all that's left, but I can't see why the sum of the changes in the argument around a contour containing zero's and poles should give the number of zero's minus the number of poles. At best, using the trick you use in proving Cauchy's integral formula I can see that: so $ i \int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \theta (z) dz$ can be interpreted as summing up these changes, but I don't see why the arrows have to be in the direction they are by looking at $ i \int _{ \gamma} \frac{d}{dz} \theta (z) dz$.

790670,Why do we require $X$ to be Hausdorff when defining $C(X)$?,"In Efton Park's ""Complex Topological K-theory"", he begins a section by defining the Banach algebra $C(X)$ (continuous functions $f: X \rightarrow \Bbb C$), presupposing that $X$ is Hausdorff and compact. It's obvious why he requires compact: otherwise, the ""norm"" wouldn't necessarily be a norm, as there could be unbounded functions on $X$. But whence the Hausdorff condition? I know that we have an anti-equivalence of categories (compact Hausdorff spaces) ~ (commutative unital C* algebras); this fails if we remove the Hausdorff requirement; consider for instance the Sierpinski 2-point space (call it $S$) with topology $\{\varnothing, \{a\}, \{a,b\}\}$. It's easy to see that $C(S) \cong \mathbb C$. Of course, $S$ is not homeomorphic to the one-point space, even though both are compact; so the anti-equivalence fails here. This is a good enough reason for me to not care so much about $X$ non-Hausdorff. But where, exactly, does $X$ non-Hausdorff cause trouble for us? I'd prefer an answer on a more basic level than the above; how far can we work with $C(X)$ with $X$ non-Hausdorff before it causes serious trouble for us?","['general-topology', 'motivation', 'banach-spaces']"

790959,On the probability of obtaining 27 sets in the card game Set,"For people not familiar with the card game Set, see its entry on Wikipedia and/or one of the related questions here on Math SE . It might be faster to just play the game a couple of times though, see e.g. this web-based version . As there are $3^4 = 81$ cards, the maximum number of sets that can be obtained is $3^3 = 27$. I have played the game many times, but never used up all cards. This makes me wonder what the odds are of obtaining $27$ sets. The game usually ends with either $23$ or $24$ sets, but $25$ is not uncommon. It is not possible to end with $26$ sets though, as the remaining $3$ cards will also form a set. Of course, certain types of sets are easier to spot than others. In addition, this seems to vary from person to person. In practice this might lead to a reduced number of obtained sets — the easier sets tend to have multiple features (number, shape, colour, shading) in common, thus upsetting the balance/distribution of features in the remaining cards. Therefore, it seems best to give priority to sets that have no features in common. This is just my intuition though. [Edit] Based on one of the comments below I'd like to update the question.

791013,"If $\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}}-\sqrt{x-\sqrt{x}}=\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{x}{x+\sqrt{x}}}$, how can it imply $x\ge1$?","I encountered this problem in a book.

And after some algebra, they get $\sqrt{x}(2\sqrt{x}-1-2\sqrt{x-1})=0$. But since $\sqrt{x}\ge1>0$, so $2\sqrt{x}-1-2\sqrt{x-1}=0$ and therefore $x=\frac{25}{16}$.

791248,Every closed subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is the zero point set of a smooth function,"In Walter Rudin's Principles of mathematical analysis Exercise 5.21, it is proved that for any closed subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, there exists a smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $E=\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid f(x)=0\}$. Since $E^c$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$, $E^c$ is a countable disjoint union of open intervals $(a_i,b_i)$. On an interval $(a,b)$, if we let $f(x)=\exp(\frac{1}{(x-a)(x-b)})$, $x\in(a,b)$; $f(x)=0$, $x\notin(a,b)$, ($f(x)=\exp(\frac{1}{(x-a)})$ or $f(x)=\exp(\frac{1}{(x-b)})$ on $(a,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,b)$ resp.), then $f$ is smooth. Hence we can get a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $E$ is the zero point sets of $f$. (1). How about a closed subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$? is it true that for any closed subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $E=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n\mid f(x)=0\}$? An open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be written as a disjoint union of countable open balls hence the proof above is not valid. The partition of unity only claims that for an  open set $U$, there exists open $V$ in $U$ such that $\bar V\subseteq U$ and a smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $supp f\subseteq U$, $f|_V=1$. (2). The taylor series of $f(x)=\exp(\frac{1}{(x-a)(x-b)})$ does not converge around points $a,b$ hence $f$ is not analytic at $a,b$.

791316,Euler's Refutation of Fermat's Conjecture,"Fermat postulated that all numbers of the form $$2^{2^n}+1$$ are prime (where n = any integer). Then Euler came along with a rather ingenious proof that this was not, in fact the case. I came across this while reading William Dunham's Journey Through Genius, Chapter 10. Here's the gist of what I get so far (of how Euler refuted Fermat's above suggestion): Theorem A: If $a$ is an even number, and $p$ is prime that does not factor evenly into $a$ (but is a factor of $a+1$), then $p = 2k+1$ for an integer $k$. So far so good, and Dunham discusses the proof for this theorem, but I'm going to guess that you mathematicians here are familiar with this. Next we move onto Theorem B. Theorem B: If $a$ is an even number and p is a prime (not a factor of $a$), and $p$ goes evenly into $a^2+1$, then for an integer $k$, $p = 4k+1$, but $p$ cannot equal $4k+3$. Here's how this works: Firstly, $a$ is even, so $a^2$ is also even. Using Theorem A, it becomes obvious that any prime factor of $a^2+1$ is odd. Ergo, $p$ is odd (so it's not 2). If we divide $p$ by 4, then $p$ can equal either $4k+1$ or $4k+3$. Since $p$ is a divisor of $a^2+1$, p also divides evenly into the product ($a^2+1$)($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$). Algebraic manipulation shows that this product equals $a^{4k+2}+1$. And this is where I'm confused. Where on earth does Dunham pull ($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$) from? No explanation is offered on his part, so any enlightenment on this would be appreciated. More Details As stated earlier, if we divide $p$ by 4, then $p$ can equal either $4k+1$ or $4k+3$ (which is pretty clear if you plug in values for $k$). We want to demonstrate that $k$ can only equal $4k+1$, and we do this by proof by contradiction (assume $p=4k+3$). Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to know the form of $p$ so we can figure out the potential factors of $2^{32}+1$, which Fermat postulated was prime. Since $p$ is not a divisor of $a$ (by hypothesis), Fermat's little theorem would suggest that $p$ goes nicely into $a^{p-1}-1=a^{{4k+3}-1}-1=a^{4k+2}-1$. Says Dunham (p. 231): ""On the other hand, we have assumed that $p$ is a divisor of $a^2+1$, and consequently $p$ is also a divisor of the product ($a^2+1$)($a^{4k}-a^{4k-2}+a^{4k-4}...+a^4-a^2+1$)."" Since this product equals $a^{4k+2}+1$, and since $p$ goes evenly into both $a^{4k+2}+1$ and $a^{4k+2}-1$, $p$ is a divisor of ($a^{4k+2}+1$)-($a^{4k+2}-1$) = 2, but this cannot be true since $p$ is an odd prime. Ergo, $p$ is not of the form $p=4k+3$.

I have no trouble showing that it is a closed mapping, but I am stuck showing continuity. Here's my progress so far: it suffices to show that preimages of closed sets in $\text{Spec}(A)$ are closed in $\text{Spec(B)}$. A closed set in $\text{Spec}(A)$, by definition, has the form $g^*(\text{Spec}(C))$ for some ring $C$ and ring homomorphism $g:A\to C$. So we want $f^{*-1}(g^*(\text{Spec}(C))$ to be closed in $\text{Spec}(B)$, i.e. of the form $h^*(\text{Spec}(D))$, for some ring $D$ and ring homomorphism $h:B\to D$. I strongly suspect the ring $D$ must be $B\otimes_AC$ and $h:B\to D$ given by $h(b)=b\otimes1_C$. We have \begin{align*} 
f^{*-1}(g^*(\text{Spec}(C))&=\{\mathfrak q\in\text{Spec}(B)|\ f^*(\mathfrak q)\in g^*(\text{Spec}(C)\}
\\&=\{\mathfrak q\in\text{Spec}(B)|\ f^*(\mathfrak q)\in(h\circ f)^*(\text{Spec}(D))\}
\\&=\{\mathfrak q\in\text{Spec}(B)|\ f^*(\mathfrak q)\in f^*(h^*(\text{Spec}(D))\}
\\&\supseteq\{\mathfrak q\in\text{Spec}(B)|\ \mathfrak q\in h^*(\text{Spec}(D))\}=h^*(\text{Spec}(D))

I can't show why the reverse inclusion holds in the last line ( if it holds, since I am not entirely sure $D$ is the correct ring). Thanks! p.s. exercise 25 of chapter 3 has a typo, for $A\to B\otimes_AC$ sending $a\mapsto f(a)\otimes g(a)$ is not in general a ring homomorphism.

If it is singular, what is null($A$)? Suppose $A$ is singular. Then, there exists a nonzero $x \in \mathbb{C}^m$ such that $Ax=0$. That is, $(I+uv^*)x=0$. This implies that $u(v^*x) = -x$. For this to be true, $x$ has to be a multiple of $u$. So, let $x = c_1u$ for some nonzero scalar $c_1$. Then, $Ax = c_1u(v^*u) = -c_1u$. Note that $u = 0$ if $v^*u = 0$. Therefore, $A$ is singular if and only if $v^*u \neq 0$, and null($A$) $=$ span($u$) if it is singular. Now, set $\alpha = -1$.

I am wondering why it is necessary for $B$ to be Hermitian. My ideas are: 1) Otherwise it will depend on the choice of a connection. But one can consider $(M, g)$ Riemannian and take as $\nabla$ Levi-Civita connection, then functoriality and Whitney sum formula seem to still work. 2) There is something complex in the idea of curvature. It seems strange that the curvature is purely imaginary (because $i\Omega$ should lie in real de-Rham cohomology).

Let me explain what's involved. Suppose $T_pM$ denotes the usual set of all equivalence classes $[\gamma]$ with respect to the equivalence $\sim$ on the set of smooth curves defined by the formula $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2 \iff (\phi \circ \gamma_1)^{\prime}(0) = (\phi \circ \gamma_2)^{\prime}(0)$ for some (and hence any) chart $(U, \phi)$ around $p$ with the additional property that $\phi(p) = 0$ (here the $\gamma$'s are standard smooth curves from $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ to $M$ such that $\gamma_i (0) = p.$) For any $v_1 = [\gamma_1], v_2 = [\gamma_2] \in T_pM$ and $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ define $a v_1 + b v_2 := [\phi^{-1}(a (\phi \circ \gamma_1) + b(\phi \circ \gamma_2))].$ Now the reader is asked to show that ""these operations are independent of the choice of chart $(U, \phi)$ and representatives $\gamma_1,$ $\gamma_2$ of the tangent vectors $v_1,$ $v_2.$"" My questions are: 1) exactly in what sense are the operations independent? To be more precise: if $(V, \psi)$ is another chart with $\psi(p) = 0,$ is it really true that $$\phi^{-1}(a (\phi \circ \gamma_1) + b(\phi \circ \gamma_2)) \sim \psi^{-1}(a (\psi \circ \gamma_1) + b(\psi \circ \gamma_2))$$ as the assertion seems to suggest and if so, how to prove it? 2) What is the connection between the other approach via the mapping $d\phi_p: T_p(M) \stackrel {\cong}{\to} \mathbb R^n= T_{\phi(p)}(V),$ $T_pM \ni v = [\gamma] \mapsto (\phi\circ \gamma)'(0)= \vec u\in \mathbb R^n$  as it is sketched in Giving tangent space a vector space structure ?

Why does $\text{div}a(x,u,\nabla u) - c(x,u,\nabla u) + g = 0$ even hold everywhere due to the smoothness of $a$ and $c$? Noting that the first integral vanishes. How does putting a arbitrary $v \in W^{1,p}_{o}$ into the given equation show that $$\nu \cdot a(x,u,\nabla u) + b(x,u) = h \text{   on    } \Gamma_{N}$$ which is the second boundary condition.

Then: $$\mathbb{P}(W\leq 0)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{?}^?\int_?^? dzdw$$
Is this alright? I am stuck on the limits of integration; my thoughts on these were that the unit square in the $A-B$ plane get mapped to the following figure in the $W-Z$ plane: $\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$ The region of integration is then the region below the $Z$ axis, which gives $\mathbb{P}(W\leq 0)=3/4.$ This can't be right though, because then the desired probability exceeds $1$.

\int \sech^4 x \, dx.
$$ I know we can solve the simple case $$
\int \sech \, dx=\int\frac{dx}{\cosh x}=\int\frac{dx\cosh x}{\cosh ^2x}=\int\frac{d(\sinh x)}{1+\sinh^2 x}=\int \frac{du}{1+u^2}=\tan^{-1}\sinh x+C.

792240,"Notation: $\mathbb{P}(\mathscr{E})$, where $\mathscr{E}$ is locally free sheaf.","Let $\mathscr{E}$ be a locally free sheaf on a scheme $X$. I always thought that $\mathbb{P}(\mathscr{E})$ meant $\mathrm{\bf Proj}(\textrm{Sym}(\mathscr{E}))$, the global Proj associated to the sheaf of symmetric algebra of $\mathscr{E}$. But, when I was reading about Hilbert schemes, I came across with the notation $\mathbb{P}((\mathrm{Sym}^{2}\mathscr{E}^{\vee}))$. It appears as the scheme parameterizing conics in a projective space; $\mathscr{E}$ denotes the universal vector bundle on the Grassmannian of projective planes $\mathbb{G}(2, n)$. I am a little bit confused. How is defined $\mathbb{P}((\mathrm{Sym}^{2}\mathscr{E}^{\vee}))$? Thank you.",['algebraic-geometry']
792246,"If the sum of two independent random variables is in $L^2$, is it true that both of them are in $L^1$?","Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent random variables. If $\mathbb E(X+Y)^2 < \infty$, do we have $\mathbb E |X| < \infty$ and $\mathbb E |Y| < \infty$? What I actually want is that $X$ and $Y$ are both in $L^2$, i.e., $\mathbb E X^2 < \infty$ and $\mathbb E Y^2 < \infty$. But this can be reduced to $\mathbb E |X|\mathbb E |X| < \infty$. Thus it suffices to show that $X$ and $Y$ are in $L^1$. It might be helpful to see that since $|X| < |Y| + |X+Y|$, (and by symmetry), either both of $X$ and $Y$ or none of them are in $L^1$. So we may assume $\mathbb E |X| = \infty$ and $\mathbb E |Y| = \infty$ and try to find a contradiction. But here is where I got stuck.","['probability-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'random-variables']"

792365,Why is $\cos (90)=-0.4$ in WebGL?,"I'm a graphical artist who is completely out of my depth on this site. However, I'm dabbling in WebGL (3D software for internet browsers) and trying to animate a bouncing ball. Apparently we can use trigonometry to create nice smooth curves. Unfortunately, I just cannot see why. I can accept this diagram: However, running some calculations just do not make sense to me: Let's set $\alpha$ to 45 (around where it appears to be in the diagram) and find the cosine value, thus giving us the green line.  $$\cos(45) = 0.5$$ Fair enough. $\cos(\alpha)$ / the green line is $0.5$ units. But now this is where it all falls apart. I would have thought if we set $\alpha$ to $90$, $\cos$ would become $0$. Do you see why I think this? Look at the digram, isn't that reasonable to think? Similarly, $\cos(0)$ I would have said should equal $1$ (twice that of $\cos(45)$ ) While $\cos(0)$ does equal $1$, this does not check out: $$ cos(90) = -0.4$$ Just do not get that $0.4$? Could someone explain? That just makes no sense to me. None. I'm using the google calculator and I would stress I have not touched maths for about $6$ years (ever since I left school!) so please lots of examples and words to explain!","['trigonometry', 'angle']"
