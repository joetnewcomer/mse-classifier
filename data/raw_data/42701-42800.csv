423337,Using the arc length function to find a parameterization of C in terms of s,"The problem: Find the arc length function $s(t)$ for the curve defined by $\vec r(t)$. Then use this result to find a parametrization of $C$ in terms of $s$. $$\vec r(t) = a\cos^3t\,\hat i + a\sin^3t\,\hat j+ \hat k,\quad 0\le t\le 2\pi$$ Attempt at Solution:
For the first part, I have produced $$\vec r'(t) = -3a \cos^2t \sin t\,\hat i + 3a\sin^2t \cos t \,\hat j$$ and $$|\vec r'(t)| = 3a\sin t \cos t$$ then $$\int^t_0|\vec r'(u)| du = \left. -\frac 32a\cos^2u \right|^t_0 = \frac 32a\sin^2t$$ At this point I need to find a parametrization in terms of $s$. There may be some identities that could help make this cleaner, but, given my current knowledge, this is what I have come up with: $$t = \arcsin\left(\sqrt \frac 23 \sqrt s\right)$$ If I was successful in solving for t, then the answer would be: $$\vec r(t(s)) = a \cos^3 \left[\arcsin\left(\sqrt \frac 23 \sqrt s\right)\right]\,\hat i + a\sin^3\left[\arcsin\left(\sqrt \frac 23 \sqrt s\right)\right]\,\hat j + \hat k$$ I hope I have given enough information and I greatly appreciate any advice or direction.",['multivariable-calculus']

423384,Intuition for the optimality of bold play,"There is a standard result (I think originally by Dubins and Savage) that if one wants to maximise the probability of winning a certain amount in an unfair game of chance then an optimal strategy is “bold play”: in each round of play bet the smaller of either your entire wealth or an amount that would ensure that you would achieve your target amount if you win in that round. See for example Section 1.7 of Billingsley's Probability and Measure . In trying to understand this intuitively I came up with this argument: If the game is unfair then the expected earnings have a negative trend
  which is linear over time. On the other hand like any random walk the
  standard deviation of the earnings is proportionate to the square root
  of time. If we let enough time to pass the linear will dominate the
  square root and we will certainly be ruined. So our only hope is to
  compress the time for which the game is played and the way to do so is
  to play large stakes. My question is whether this intuitive argument comes close to what is happening? Also, is there is a way to turn this argument into a rigorous proof? The idea came to me from knowing that random walks can be embedded into Brownian motion but unfortunately I don't know enough about such embeddings to judge if the reasoning above is sound.","['probability-theory', 'random-walk', 'brownian-motion']"

423431,Tangent map $F_{*}: T_{p}(M) \to T_{F(p)}(N)$ are linear tranformations.,"How to show that tangent map $F_{*}: T_{p}(M) \to T_{F(p)}(N)$ are linear tranformations? I know that it suffices to show that $$F_{*}(ax_{u}+bx_{v})=aF_{*}(x_{u})+bF_{*}(x_{v})$$ where $x$ is a patch in $M$. By definition, $$F_{*}(ax_{u}+bx_{v})=\frac{d}{dt}F(\alpha(t))_{t=0}$$
where $\alpha'(0)=ax_{u}+bx_{v}$. I also know that if $y=F(\alpha(t))$, then $y'=F_{*}(\alpha'(t))$. We can express $\alpha(t) =x(a_{1}(t),a_{2}(t))$, then $$\alpha'(t) =a_{1}'(t)[x_{u}(a_{1}(t),a_{2}(t))]+a_{2}'[x_{v}(a_{1}(t),a_{2}(t))]$$ For $t=0$, $\alpha'(0) =a_{1}'(0)[x_{u}(a_{1}(0),a_{2}(0))]+a_{2}'[x_{v}(a_{1}(0),a_{2}(0))]=ax_{u}+bx_{v}$. Thus, I get $a_{1}(0)=u$, $a_{2}(0)=v$, $a_{1}'(0)=a$, $a_{2}'(0)=b$. Now, we can say that $$F_{*}(ax_{u}+bx_{y})=\frac{d}{dt}F(x(a_{1}(t),x(a_{2}(t)))_{t=0}$$
$$=a_{1}'(0)\frac{\partial}{\partial{u}}F(x(a_{1}(t),x(a_{2}(t)))+a_{2}'(0)\frac{\partial}{\partial{v}}F(x(a_{1}(t),x(a_{2}(t))$$ If $\frac{\partial}{\partial{u}}F(x)=F(x_{u})$

$ A =

$  What i've tried so far: Let $A$ be a general $3 \times 3$-Matrix. We are trying to find $A$ such that $AP = PA$. This equation basically means the following:
$AP$ is A with permuted columns. $PA$ is A with permuted rows. This means that $A$ has to be such that permuting columns and rows in the same way leaves the marix looking the same. For example for the permutations which flip $1$ and $2$: $
\begin{pmatrix}
d & e & f \\
a & b & c  \\
g & h & i  \\

$
\begin{pmatrix}
b & a & c \\
e & d & f  \\
h & g & i  \\

Resulting in the following equations: $a = i, b = h, g = c, f = d , b = d, a = e, c = f, h = g, b = c, f = h, i = e, g = d$ which means : $ a= e = i$ and $b=c=d=g=h$ which is exactly what I was looking for. The thing now is. If I look at permutations which not only swap two rows/columns (for example $(123) \implies (312)$ ) I get equations which contradict my above equations. What am I doing wrong?

423814,Are homomorphisms into PGL related to the Schur multiplier?,"I've been trying to understand homomorphisms from a finite group $G$ into $\operatorname{PGL}(n,R)$ for $n$ a positive integer, and $R$ a commutative ring with 1, usually a field. I had been under the impression that these were induced by homomorphisms from the Darstellungsgruppen of $G$ into $\operatorname{GL}(n,R)$, but I am having doubts. What is wrong with the following example? Take $G$ to be cyclic of order 2. Its Schur multiplier is trivial, so it is its own Darstellungsgruppe. For $r \in R^\times$, set $a=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ r & 0 \end{bmatrix} \in \operatorname{GL}(2,R)$. Then $a^2 = r a^0 \in Z(\operatorname{GL}(2,R))$ so $\bar a$ has order 2 in $\operatorname{PGL}(2,R)$. Consider the homomorphism from $G$ to $\operatorname{PGL}(2,R)$ that sends a generator to $\bar a$. This is not induced by any homomorphism from a covering group of $G$ to $\operatorname{GL}(2,R)$ as long as $r$ has no square root in $R$. Indeed any such homomorphism is determined by where it sends a generator, say to $b$, and to induce the original homomorphism to PGL $\bar b$ must equal $\bar a$. If $\bar b = \bar a$ then $$b=\zeta a = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \zeta \\ \zeta r & 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad b^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \zeta^2 r & 0 \\ 0 & \zeta^2 r \end{bmatrix}$$
If we want $b$ to have order 2, then $\zeta^2 r = 1$ and $\zeta^2 = \tfrac{1}{r}$, so if $r$ has no square root in $R^\times$, there is no such $b$. Even if we claim the Darstellungsgruppen is cyclic of order 4 (since $H^2(C_2, R^\times)$ is likely equal to $(R^\times)/(R^\times)^2 \cong C_2$) we still need $\zeta^2r = -1$, but if $-1$ is a square in $R$, then $-r$ also has no square root, and it is still a counterexample.","['projective-space', 'representation-theory', 'group-cohomology', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

My approach is as follows. Note that $a= b$ only when $a= b= 1$. So this will always give one solution. Now consider the case when $a$ is not equal to $b$. By symmetry assume $a>b$. We can multiply by $2$ later go get our final answer. Now for $N$ let the answer be $f(N)$. Now we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers $a$ and $b$ are their such that $\gcd(a, b)= 1$ and $1\leq a<b\leq N+1$. Note that $f(N+1)= f(N) + \phi(N+1)$. This is because $1\leq a<b\leq N$ has $f(N)$ solutions, so $1\leq a<b\leq N+1$ also has these $N$ solutions, but in addition when calculating $f(N+1)$ we can set $b= N+1$ and get $\phi(N)$ possible values of $N$. So $f(N+1)= f(N) + \phi(N)$. Thus solving this recurrence relation we get $$f(N)= \phi(N) + \phi(N-1) + \dots + \phi(4) + f(3)= \phi(N) + \phi(N-1) + \dots + \phi(4) + 2.$$ My question is, is my approach correct here?

423923,Why is the Expected Value different from the number needed for 50% chance of success?,"An event with probability $p$ of being success is executed $\frac{1}{p}$ times. For example, if $p=5\%$, the event would then be executed $20$ times. The Expected Value for the total number of trials needed to get one success is $\frac{1}{p}$. In this case, it's $20$. What I'm confused is, as p approaches zero, the chance of having a success in the first $\frac{1}{p}$ trials always approaches to $1-\frac{1}{e}$, or about $63\%$. This means: $P$(at least $1$ success in all $\frac{1}{p}$ trials) is about $63\%$. This $63\%$ is higher than $50\%$. It seems to suggest that, if I take all $\frac{1}{p}$ trials and consider them as one big event, and do this big event multiple times, I'd get more successes than failures. But on the other hand, since $\frac{1}{p}$ times is the EV mentioned earlier, shouldn't the big event have an equal chance of being a success or a failure?",['probability']
423932,What is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse for scaled linear regression?,"The matrix equation for linear regression is:
$$ \vec{y} = X\vec{\beta}+\vec{\epsilon} $$
The Least Square Error solution of this forms the normal equations: $$ ({\bf{X}}^T \bf{X}) \vec{\beta}= {\bf{X}}^T \vec{y} $$ Using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse:
$$ X^+ = ({\bf{X}}^T \bf{X})^{-1}{\bf{X}}^T $$
this can be written as:
$$  \vec{\beta}= A^+ \vec{y} $$
Decomposing using SVD:
$$ X=U\Sigma V^T$$ alledgely leads to: 
$$ X^+=V \Sigma^+U^T $$ where the pseudoinverse of $ \Sigma $ is just found by taking the inverse of all nonzero diagonal elements. The point of doing things this way is that I will be doing linear regression n >> 1 times and $\vec{y}$ will vary but X (and therefore $X^+$ also) will be constant. In particular I am interested in doing ""scaled"" linear regression: 
$$ \vec{y} = WX\vec{\beta}+\vec{\epsilon} $$ 
where W is a diagonal matrix (and in my case the diagonal elements are integer values) which change over n. The reason for this is that sometimes I have multiple measurements of $y_i$ for the same X. I understand that I could solve this using the pseudoinverse of WX but this pseudoinverse would then have to be found for each n and that defeats the point. In the case of scaled linear regression the normal equations are:
$$ ({\bf{X}}^T \bf{W}^2 \bf{X}) \vec{\beta}= ({\bf{X}}^T \bf{W}^T) \vec{y} $$ If I substitute SVD into this equation what is then the equation for $ \vec{\beta} $? I am hoping for some cheap operation so that:
$$  \vec{\beta}= operation(W,X^+,\vec{y}) $$ As an example something like
$$  \vec{\beta}= (WX^+)\vec{y} $$
would be ideal (this example is probable not correct though),
since I would just find the pseudoinverse of X once (costly) and then multiply it with a diagonal matrix and a vector (cheap) for each n.","['numerical-linear-algebra', 'pseudoinverse', 'linear-algebra', 'regression']"

If we know that any such limit is a fixed point of $f$, that is, $f(x_\infty) = x_\infty$ for any such convergent subsequence, does it force the whole sequence $f^n(x_0)$ to converge to $x_\infty$? If needed, we may  assume $f$ has only finitely many, and hence discrete fixed points. I see that each translate of the subsequence ($f^{n_i+r}(x_0)$) converges to $x_\infty$, and this would have solved the problem if the differences between consecutive $n_i$ were bounded. Also, I'm pretty sure that this, combined with the fixed points being isolated, forces any convergent subsequence to have the same limit, but that doesn't seem to prove the result either.

Then we have, if $X$ was affine, $i$ is an isomorphism, which is not the case. So we want to see that $i^*$ is an isomorphism. Therefore note that $\mathscr{O}(X)$ is a subring of the function field $k(x,y)$, that contains $k[x,y]$. Take $P=(a,b)\in X$. Then $\mathscr{O}_{X,P}=\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{A}^2,P}=k[x,y]_{\mathfrak{m}_P}$ whith $\mathfrak{m}_P=(x-a,y-b)$ is maximal ideal of $k[x,y]$. -> Here is my first questions. How did we get this continued equality? I don't see how this is connected... (my commutative algebra knowledge has some gaps.) But accepting that, we have $\mathscr{O}(X)\subset\bigcap\limits_{P\not=(0,0)}k[\mathfrak{m}_P]$. And this intersection lies inside of k(x,y). Now we take $f=\frac{g}{h}\in K(x,y)$ with $g,h\in k[x,y]$ coprime. Then $f\in k[x,y]_{\mathfrak{m}_P}$ iff $h(P)\not=0$. (Use that $k[x,y]$ is a UFD). -> First, how did we see that $k[x,y]$ is UFD?

If $h$ is not a unit, then there are infinitely many $P\in \mathbb{A}^2$ such that $h(P)=0$ and thus also such points in $X$, and so $f\not\in\mathscr{O}(X)$. So we have that $f\in\mathscr{O}(X)$ if $h$ is a unit. So $f\in k[x,y]$. Thus $k[x,y]=\mathscr{O}(X)$ and hence $X$ not affine. -> Now the last question, why does follow that $X$ is not affine?

The source I'm reading says that this follows by Lesbesgue's theorem (I assume the D.C.T.) once we show that $I(v)$ is locally bounded. The function $f$ is continuous in $v$. I know we need to see that 
$$\lim_{v\to v_0} |I(v) - I(v_0)| = \lim_{v\to v_0} |\int f(v,w)-f(v_0,w) dw| = 0 = \int \lim_{v \to v_0} |f(v_0,w)-f(v,w)| dw, $$ but I don't see how getting a bound $|I(v)| \leq M$ for $v$ near $v_0$ helps with that. You get $\lim_{v\to v_0} |I(v) - I(v_0)| \leq 2M,$ of course, but that doesn't seem like enough. The measure space is not finite, and there's not a lot of information about $f$ (not known to be bounded, etc). Any guidance would be appreciated. I think this must be simple, but I'm just not seeing it. Thanks. [Specifically, $w = (y,s) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $v = (x,t) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^+$. The function $f$ is 
$$ f(v,w) = f(x,t,y,s) = \frac{\chi_{[0,t]}(s)}{(t-s)^{1/2}}e^{i(x-y)^2/(4t-4s)} F(y,s)$$
where $F$ is a function which I know little about. ] To apply the D.C.T. to this function, I would need an integrable  $g(y,s)$ s.t. 
$$ \frac{\chi_{(0,t_0+\delta)}(s)}{(t_0+\delta - s)^{1/2}}|F(y,s)| \leq g(y,s)$$ for fixed $t_0$ and all $\delta$ sufficiently small. 
This doesn't seem possible, since the L.H.S. of the above approaches infinity as $s \to t_0 + \delta$, so there can't be a dominating function that works for all small $\delta$. Is there possibly another Lebesgue's theorem that would be applicable here?","['calculus', 'analysis']"

424216,Minesweeper - Chance of one-click win,"I'd like to know if it's possible to calculate the odds of winning a game of Minesweeper (on easy difficulty) in a single click. This page documents a bug that occurs if you do so, and they calculate the odds to around 1 in 800,000.  However, this is based on the older version of Minesweeper, which had a fixed number of preset boards, so not every arrangement of mines was possible.  (Also the board size in the current version is 9x9, while the old one was 8x8.  Let's ignore the intermediate and expert levels for now - I assume those odds are nearly impossible, though a generalized solution that could solve for any W×H and mine-count would be cool too, but a lot more work I'd think.)  In general, the increased board size (with the same number of mines), as well as the removal of the preset boards would both probably make such an event far more common. So, assuming a 9x9 board with 10 mines, and assuming every possible arrangement of mines is equally likely (not true given the pseudo-random nature of computer random number generators, but let's pretend), and knowing that the first click is always safe (assume the described behavior on that site still holds - if you click on a mine in the first click, it's moved to the first available square in the upper-left corner), we'd need to first calculate the number of boards that are 1-click solvable.  That is, boards with only one opening, and no numbered squares that are not adjacent to that opening.  The total number of boards is easy enough: $\frac{(W×H)!}{((W×H)-M)! ×M!}$ or $\frac{81!}{71!×10!} \approx 1.878×10^{12}$.  (Trickier is figuring out which boards are not one-click solvable unless you click on a mine and move it.  We can maybe ignore the first-click-safe rule if it over-complicates things.)  Valid arrangements would have all 10 mines either on the edges or far enough away from each other to avoid creating numbers which don't touch the opening.  Then it's a simple matter of counting how many un-numbered spaces exist on each board and dividing by 81. Is this a calculation that can reasonably be represented in a mathematical formula?  Or would it make more sense to write a program to test every possible board configuration?  (Unfortunately, the numbers we're dealing with get pretty close to the maximum value storable in a 64-bit integer, so overflow is very likely here.  For example, the default Windows calculator completely borks the number unless you multiply by hand from 81 down to 72.)","['recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

I checked that $y$ is one-to-one. I also checked that $T(M)$ satisfies the covering property and the Hausdorff property. Thus if I show that it satisfies the smooth overlap property, $T(M)$ will become manifold. The smooth overlap property : For any patches $x,y$ in collection of patches $P$, the composite functions $y^{-1}x$ and $x^{-1}y$ are Euclidean differentiable. I assumed that $x,z$ are patches in M and $y_{1},y_{2}$ are patches in $T(M)$ $$y_{1}^{-1}y_{2}(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4})=y_{1}^{-1}[p_{3}x_{u}(p_{1},p_{2})+p_{4}x_{v}(p_{1},p_{2})]=(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},q_{4})$$ Then we get $$y(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},q_{4})=q_{3}z_{u}(q_{1},q_{2})+q_{4}z_{v}(q_{1},q_{2})=p_{3}x_{u}(p_{1},p_{2})+p_{4}x_{v}(p_{1},p_{2})$$ Thus $q_{3}=p_{3}$, $q_{4}=p_{4}$, $z_{u}(q_{1},q_{2})=x_{u}(p_{1},p_{2})$, $z_{v}(q_{1},q_{2})=x_{v}(p_{1},p_{2})$.

\|x\|_p\leq\|x\|_r\leq n^{(1/r-1/p)}\|x\|_p.
$$ I have two questions about the above inequality. $(\bf 1)$. The first is how to show $\|x\|_p\leq\|x\|_r$ when $p,r\leq1$. When $p>r\geq1$, we can define $$f(s)=\|x\|_s,\,\,s\geq1$$ and find out that $$f'(s)=\|x\|_s\left\{-\frac{1}{s^2}\log(\sum_i|x_i|^s)+\frac{1}{s}\frac{\sum_i|x_i|^s\log(|x_i|)}{\sum_i|x_i|^s}\right\}.$$ Then by the concavity of the $\log$ function, we can see that $$\frac{\sum_i|x_i|^s\log(|x_i|)}{\sum_i|x_i|^s}\leq \log\left(\sum_i\frac{|x_i|^s}{\sum_j|x_j|^s}\cdot|x_i|\right).$$
Let $$y_i=\frac{|x_i|^s}{\sum_j|x_j|^s},$$ it is easy to see $\|y\|_{s^*}\leq1$, where $s^*\geq1$ and $1/s+1/s^*=1$. Then, the Hölder's inequality leads to
$$\frac{\sum_i|x_i|^s\log(|x_i|)}{\sum_i|x_i|^s}\leq \log\left(\sum_i\frac{|x_i|^s}{\sum_j|x_j|^s}\cdot|x_i|\right)= \log\left(\sum_iy_i\cdot|x_i|\right)\leq\log(\|x\|_s\|y\|_{s^*})\leq\log\|x\|_s.$$
Therefore, we can conclude $f'(s)\leq0$ and $\|x\|_p\leq\|x\|_r$ is satisfied. However, when $p,r<1$, we do not have $s^*\geq1$ and $\|y\|_{s^*}\leq1$. The last step does not work any more. (${\bf 2}$). My second question is how to show $\|x\|_r\leq n^{(1/r-1/p)}\|x\|_p.$ In fact, I was trying to show this by solving the following optimization problem: $$

Take the $\arctan$ of this quotient, and approximate to the nearest fraction with denominator no larger than ~$10^{12}$ (or a few orders of magnitude less than floating point precision).

I could only answer: ""It's this nice thing, which measures distance of some kind"" :) The definitions usually also contain eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which I have little trouble connecting to the Mahanalobis distance. I understand the definition of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, but how are they related to the Mahanalobis distance? Does it have something to do with changing the base in Linear Algebra etc.? I have also read these former questions on the subject: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41222/what-is-mahanalobis-distance-how-is-it-used-in-pattern-recognition Intuitive explanations for Gaussian distribution function and mahalanobis distance http://www.jennessent.com/arcview/mahalanobis_description.htm The answers are good and pictures nice, but still I don't really get it...I have an idea but it's still in the dark. Can someone give a ""How would you explain it to your grandma""-explanation so that I could finally wrap this up and never again wonder what the heck is a Mahanalobis distance? :) Where does it come from, what, why? I will post this question on two different forums so that more people could have a chance answering it and I think many other people might be interested besides me :) Thank you in advance for help!","['statistics', 'linear-algebra', 'pattern-recognition', 'probability']"

$$\csc {\dfrac{j\pi}{n}}-\csc{\dfrac{k\pi}{n}}=2$$ This problem from $AMM,1999,10630$, but this solution is very ugly,and it's not nice.
I think this problem have other methods,Thank you everyone. I find this","['trigonometry', 'number-theory']"
424462,Hilbert polynomial of disjoint union of lines in $\Bbb{P}^3$,"Let $X$ be the disjoint union of the two lines in $\Bbb{P}^3$ given by $Z(x,y)$ and $Z(z,w)$. Letting $R = k[x,y,z,w]$, I have computed the following free resolution for the homogeneous coordinate ring  $S(X)$: $$0 \to R(-4) \stackrel{\varphi_0}{\longrightarrow} R(-3)^4 \stackrel{\varphi_1}{\longrightarrow} R(-2)^4 \stackrel{\varphi_2}{\longrightarrow} R \longrightarrow S(X) \to 0.$$ $\varphi_0$ is the map that sends $r \in R(-4)$ to the $4$ - tuple  $(ry,-rz,rw,-rx)$, $\varphi_1$ is multiplication by the matrix $$\left( \begin{array}{cc} z & y & 0 & 0 \\ -w & 0 &y & 0 \\ 0& 0& -x & w \\ 0 & -x & 0 &-z \end{array}\right)$$
and $\varphi_2$ is multiplication by the row matrix matrix $\left(\begin{array}{cccc} xw & xz & yw & yz\end{array}\right)$. Note I have used that $I(X)= (x,y) \cap (z,w) = (xw,xz,yw,yz)$. From the free resolution above I then computed the Hilbert polynomial $H_X(t)$ for $X$: $$H_X(t) = 2(t+1).$$ My questions are: Is the free resolution for $S(X)$ above a minimal resolution for $S(X)$ ? If not how can I find the minimal one? What is the significance of the Hilbert polynomial in this case, for example how does it encode information about the dimension of $X$? What if I have a general projective variety?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
424471,Given that $ x + \frac 1 x = r $ what is the value of: $ x^3 + \frac 1 {x^2}$ in terms of $r$?,"Given that $$ x + \cfrac 1 x = r $$ what is the value of: $$ x^3 + \cfrac 1 {x^2}$$ in terms of $r$? NOTE: it is $\cfrac 1 {x^2}$ and not $ \cfrac 1 {x^3} $ Where I reached so far:
$$ \Big(x^3 + \cfrac 1 {x^2}\Big) + \cfrac 1 x \cdot\Big(x^3 + \cfrac 1 {x^2}\Big) = r^3 - r^2 -3r - 2 $$ Any hints??",['algebra-precalculus']
