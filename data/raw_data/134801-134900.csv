2126551,Do we know a transcendental number with a proven bounded continued fraction expansion?,"The simple continued-fraction-expansion for the transcendental number $e$ is known to be unbounded. What about bounded continued fractions ? Do we know any transcendental number for which it is proven that the simple continued-fraction-expansion is bounded ? It is conjectured that the simple continued-fraction-expansion of the algebraic numbers with minimal polynomial degree greater than $2$ are unbounded. If this would be true, every bounded non-periodic infinite simple continued-fraction-expansion would correspond with a transcendental number. But to my knowledge, it was not proven for a single algebraic number with minimal polynomial degree greater than $2$, that its simple continued-fraction-expansion is unbounded.","['number-theory', 'continued-fractions', 'transcendental-numbers']"
2126580,"Find the PDF of G(X,Y)=$(X,\frac{9}{(X+Y)^{2}})$ Transformation given the pdf of $f_{XY}(x,y)$","So I made up a problem for myself, and am sort of confused on how to get started.  if you work out the full solution I will be sad! This is a deviation from a book problem in Casella and Burger 4.4 where I've made the problem a bit harder. and am stuck. so here is the joint pdf $f(x,y)=\frac{1}{4}(x+2y)$ for $0<y<1$ and $0<x<2$ and 0 other wise. My question has to do with transformations of multi-variable probability densities
Let $G(X,Y)=(g_{1}(X,Y),g_{2}(X,Y))= (X,\frac{9}{(X+Y)^{2}})$ be a random variable $(X,Y) \to (X,V)$ Now assume that G is is invertible and now we find the inverse on this interval. doing some algebra returns H(U,V)= (U,$\frac{3}{\sqrt{V}}-U)$. 
a little more algebra to find the Jacobian returns
$|J| = \frac{3}{2}v^{-\frac{3}{2}}$
Now finding the joint pdf under the transformation 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f_{UV}(u,v) &=\frac{1}{4}(u + 2(\frac{3}{\sqrt{v}} - u))\cdot \frac{3}{2}v^{-\frac{3}{2}} \\
 &= \frac{3}{8}(\frac{6}{v^{2}}- \frac{u}{v^{\frac{3}{2}}})
\end{split}
\end{equation} now assuming I escaped an algebra mistake, is the set up that I've done correct?
essentially the conceptual idea is that given a joint PDF of X,Y I looked at a transformation of G, found the inverse and the Jacobian. and now the joint pdf $f_{UV}(u,v)$ is joint pdf of X,Y under the map of G ? thank you all for any help","['multivariable-calculus', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
2126598,How does the derivative with respect to the complex conjugate even make sense?,"I came across this the other day:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}} = \frac12\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)
$$
I decided to attempt to work it out myself to better understand it. I know $2x = z + \bar{z}$, and $2iy = z - \bar{z}$, and using the total derivative we have
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \bar{z}} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \bar{z}}
$$
and this is about where I got stuck. How exactly am I supposed to calculate $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \bar{z}}$? My confusion doesn't lie in the notation, but in the mechanics of the very thing I'm being asked to differentiate. Look at $x$:
$$
x(\bar{z}) = \frac{\bar{z} + z}{2} = \frac{\bar{z}+\bar{\bar{z}}}{2}
$$
if we label $Z = \bar{z}$, then $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \bar{z}} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial Z}$, and $x(Z) = \frac{Z+\bar{Z}}2$. However, as far as I can tell, $\frac{Z+\bar{Z}}{2}$ isn't even complex differentiable, because $\bar{Z}$ isn't complex differentiable with respect to $Z$. $x(Z)$ doesn't satisfy the CR equations:
$$
x(X+iY) = X + i0 = u(X, Y) + iv(X, Y) \\
u_X = 1 \neq 0 = v_Y \\
v_X = 0 \neq -1 = -u_Y
$$ 
so how could I possibly take the complex derivative of it? That doesn't make any sense. What exactly am I missing here? Is the derivative $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \bar{z}}$ a different kind of derivative? Are we not supposed to do the complex derivative but instead something else?","['derivatives', 'complex-analysis']"

2126824,Is there a quicker way to solve this integral: $\int \frac{3-\cos(x)}{(1+2\cos(x))\sin^2(x)}dx$?,"The integral is:
$$ \int \frac{3-\cos(x)}{(1+2\cos(x))\sin^2(x)}dx$$
This is the way I approached it:
$$ \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=u\\dx=\frac{2}{\sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}du$$
By using trigonometric identities we get:
$$ \sin(x)=\frac{2u}{1+u^2};\ \cos(x)=\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2};\ \sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=1+u^2
$$
Therefore the integral now becomes:
$$ 2\int \frac{3-\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}}{\left(1+2\left(\frac{1-u^2}{1+u^2}\right)\right)\left(\frac{2u}{1+u^2}\right)^2(1+u^2)}du=$$ $$\int\frac{(1+2u^2)(1+u^2)}{u^2(3-u^2)}du$$ By dividing the two polynomials we get: $$\int\left(-2-\frac{9u^2+1}{u^2(3-u^2)}\right)du$$ Using partial fractions we get to the simplified form: $$\int\left(-2-\frac{1}{3u^2}+\frac{28}{3(3-u^2)}\right)du$$ $$-2u-\frac{1}{3u}+\frac{28\sqrt3}{9}\int\frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt3}\right)^2}du \\ -2u-\frac{1}{3u}+\frac{28\sqrt3\tanh^{-1}{\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt3}\right)}}{9}+C$$
By substituting back in for $u$, we get the solution: $$ \bbox[5px,border:2px solid black]{\frac{28\sqrt3\tanh^{-1}{\left(\frac{\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt3}\right)}}{9}-2\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)-\frac{1}{3}\cot\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+C}$$

2127118,Chi square and gamma distribution.,"I have studied the intuiton of the gamma distribution and have understood the following: Let us suppose that we want to study the probability of waiting time until the $\alpha$-th event occurs. Let $W$ be the corresponding ramdon value. Then we want to calculate $F(w)=P(W\leq w)=1-P(W>w)$. Now, the waiting time $W$ is greater than some value $w$ only if there are fewer than $α$ events in the interval $[0,w]$. That is: $$
\begin{align}
F(w) 
& = 1 − P(\text{fewer than $α$ events in $[0,w]$)} \\
& = 1 − P(\text{0 events or 1 event or … or $(α−1)$ events in $[0,w]$)}
\end{align}
$$ Then one can use the Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda w$ to obtain $$F(w)=1-\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\alpha-1} \dfrac{(\lambda w)^k e^{-\lambda w}}{k!}$$ Calculating the first derivation and doing some simplifications with $\lambda=1/\theta$, this leads to
$$f(w)=\frac 1 {\Gamma(\alpha) \theta^\alpha} e^{-w/\theta} w^{\alpha-1}$$ where $\alpha$ can now be used as a real positive number. So in a way the Gamma distributions gives the posibility of that $\alpha$ events occur until some determined time. Thus, $\theta$ is the mean waiting time until the first event, and $\alpha$ is the number of events for which you are waiting to occur. That I would like to know it the following: Is there any geometric/intuitive way to know why the Chi squared distriution takes the values $\theta=2$ and $\alpha=r/2$ as a special case of the gamma distribution?

Why Is the sum of this squares interesting/special?

Hoping that it is a simple problem for those who have more experience with direct limits than I do, I decided to ask it here. Let $(G_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of abelian groups such that $G_i \subseteq G_{i+1}$ and consider the directed system $G_0 \times G_1 \times \dots \rightarrow_{\varphi_0} G_1 \times G_2 \times \dots \rightarrow_{\varphi_1} \dots$ where each homomorphism $\varphi_k$ is given by $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\dots) \mapsto (\alpha\beta, \gamma, \delta, \dots)$. Is it possible to describe the direct limit of this system in terms of standard group theoretic constructions? I am aware of the standard construction of direct limits by taking an appropriate quotient of the disjoint union. I was hoping that there is a ""simpler"" description which avoids disjoint unions. Here is what I was able to think so far. Consider the system $G_1 \times G_2 \dots \rightarrow_{\psi_0} G_2 \times G_3 \dots \rightarrow_{\psi_1} \dots$ where each homomorphism $\psi_k$ is the left shift map given by $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\dots) \mapsto (\beta, \gamma, \delta, \dots)$. If I am not mistaken, the direct limit of this system should be the reduced product of the groups $G_i$ along the cofinite filter, where the isomorphism takes any element in the direct limit to the equivalence class of the appropriate sequence. This suggests that the reduced product should be a part of the original direct limit I am considering. However, I can't really figure out how the first component that I discarded is going to interact with the reduced product.",['group-theory']

2127476,Looking for references about a tessellation of a regular polygon by rhombuses.,"A regular polygon with an even number of vertices can be tessellated by rhombii (or lozenges), all with the same sidelength, with angles in arithmetic progression as can be seen on figures 1 to 3. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 I had already seen this kind of tessellation, and I met it again in a recent question on this site ( Tiling of regular polygon by rhombuses ). Let the polygon be $n$ -sided with $n$ even. The starlike pattern of rhombii issued from the rightmost point, that we will call the source, can be seen as successive ''layers'' of similar rhombii. A first layer $R_1$ with the most acute angles (they are $m:=\dfrac{n}{2}-1$ of them), then moving away from the source, a second layer $R_2$ with $m-1$ rhombii, etc. with a grand total of $\dfrac{m(m+1)}{2}$ rhombii. It is not difficult to show that rhombii in layer $R_p$ are characterized by angles $p\dfrac{\pi}{m+1}.$ In fact (I had no idea of it at first), the rhombii pattern described above is much less mysterious when seen into a larger structure such as shown in figure 4. The generation process is simple: a regular polygon with $m$ sides is rotated by successive rotations with angle $\dfrac{\pi}{m+1}$ around one of its vertices. Fig. 4 My question about this tessellation is twofold: where can I find some references? are there known properties/applications? The different figures have been produced by Matlab programs. The program that has generated Fig. 2 is given below ; it uses complex numbers, especially apt to render angular relationships: hold on;axis equal
 m=9;n=2*m+2;
 i=complex(0,1);pri=exp(2*i*pi/n);
 v=pri.^(0:(n-1));

 end; Edit : I am indebted to @Ethan Bolker for attracting my attention to zonohedra (or zomes, as some architects call them), a 3D extension of Fig. 4 (or an equivalent one with less or more circles) ; by 3D extension, we mean a polyhedron made of (planar) rhombic facets whose projection on $xOy$ plane is the initial figure, as shown on Fig. 5. The idea is simple (we refer here to the two left figures in Fig. 6): the central red ""layer"" (with the thinnest rhombi) is ""lifted"" as an umbrella whose highest point, the apex of the zonohedra, say at height $z=1$ , with the bottom of the $n$ ribs of the umbrella at $z=1-a$ . Let us denote by $V_k, \ k=1, \cdots n$ with components $\left(\cos(\tfrac{2 \pi k}{n}),\sin(\tfrac{2 \pi k}{n}), -a\right)$ the (3D) vectors issued from the apex. Layer $1$ rhombi have sides $V_k$ and $V_{k+1}$ ; by the very definition of a rhombus, layer $2$ (yellow) rhombi have sides $V_k$ and $V_{k+2}$ , etc. Note that Fig. 6, unlike Fig. 5,  displays a closed zonohedron obtained by gluing 2 identical zonohedra. The right part of Fig. 6 displays the same zonohedron colored in a spiraling way. Let us remark that there is a degree of freedom, i.e., the way the initial ""umbrella"" with ribs $V_k$ is more or less open, i.e., $a$ can be chosen.

2127919,Ergodic flows have ergodic points in time,"Let $(X, \mathcal B, \mu)$ be a Borel probability space. A measurable flow (to my understanding) is an automorphism $\mathbb R \to \mathrm{Aut}(X)$, i.e. a collection of measure-preserving maps $T_t : X \to X$ such that $T_{t + s} = T_t \circ T_s$ for every $t, s \in \mathbb R$. A flow is ergodic if, whenever $A \in \mathcal B$ satisfies $T_t(A) = A$ for every $t \in \mathbb R$, we have $\mu(A) = 0$ or $1$. I am trying to prove that the first of the following two statements implies the second: The flow $T_t$ is ergodic. There exists a time $t_0 \in \mathbb R$ such that the discrete-time map $\hat T : X \to X$ defined by $\hat T(x) = T_{t_0}(x)$ is ergodic, i.e. whenever $A \in \mathcal B$ satisfies $\hat T^{-1}(A) = A$, we have $\mu(A) = 0$ or $1$. This does not seem to be a trivial problem: given a set $A \in \mathcal B$ with $0 < \mu(A) < 1$, the first statement does not a priori preclude the existence of a time $t_0$ such that $T_{t_0}(A) = A$. In fact, it is a known result that an ergodic flow can have at most countably many non-ergodic times $t_0$. However, without using this result (which I'm currently working on proving independently), it is not clear to me why every time $t_0$ cannot be non-ergodic. So, does Statement 1 imply Statement 2?","['dynamical-systems', 'ergodic-theory', 'measure-theory']"

2128137,Optimization problem: The curve with the minimum time to get through a pile of quicksand - Calculus of Variations,"Suppose we have a function for the velocity given by $v(r,\theta)=r$ , or in Cartesian form $v(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ . As we can see below, as we get closer to the origin $(0,0)$ , the velocity decreases. I've found it easy to visualize the field as being some form of quicksand where it is harder to move through as you approach the origin. This is demonstrated below by a plot I've made using Wolfram Mathematica: What I am trying to do: Find the two functions for $y(x)$ which would minimize the time taken to get from point $A(-1,0)$ and $B(1,0)$ . I deduced that the fastest path cannot be the straight line directly from $A$ to $B$ , since it would require an infinite time to get through the origin. A guess for the two curves is shown by the $\color{#0050B0}{\text{dark blue}}$ and the $\color{#00AAAA}{\text{light blue}}$ curves I've made. I'm almost certain they would be symmetrical. I've first guessed that the optimized curve would be similar to an ellipse, however I hesitated after I've plotted this. I've done some research on the problem and figured it may be similar to the derivation of the Brachistochrone curve , using the Euler-Lagrange equations. I am new to the Calculus of Variations, so here is the working I've done so far. We have: $$dt=\frac{ds}{v} \Rightarrow dt=\frac{\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \Rightarrow dt=\frac{\sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2}}{r}~d\theta$$ On the third step I converted it to polar coordinates. Adding integration signs: $$\int_{0}^{T}~dt=\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2}\frac{\sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2}}{r}~d\theta$$ $$T=\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{1+\frac{(r')^2}{r^2}}~d\theta$$ Where $T$ is the total time taken to get from $A$ to $B$ . I thought of using the following Euler-Lagrange Equation: $$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial r'}\right)=\frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \tag{1}$$ For the functional: $$L(\theta,r,r')=\sqrt{1+\frac{(r')^2}{r^2}}$$ Evaluating partial derivatives: $$\frac{dL}{dr}=-\frac{(r')^2}{r^3\sqrt{\frac{(r')^2}{r^2}+1}}=-\frac{(r')^2}{r^2\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}$$ $$\frac{dL}{dr'}=\frac{r'}{r^2\sqrt{\frac{(r')^2}{r^2}+1}}=\frac{r'}{r\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}$$ Substituting into $(1)$ : $$\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{r'}{r\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}\right)=-\frac{(r')^2}{r^2\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}$$ I integrated both sides with respect to $\theta$ and obtained: $$\frac{r'}{r\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}=-\frac{(r')^2\theta}{r^2\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2}}+C \tag{2}$$ Now, I realize I must solve this differential equation. I've tried simplifying it to obtain: $$r\frac{dr}{d\theta}=-\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2\theta+Cr^2\sqrt{\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2+r^2} \tag{3}$$ However, I think I've hit a dead end. I'm not certain that it is solvable in terms of elementary functions. Both Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha have not given me a solution to this differential equation. To conclude, I would like some guidance on how to continue solving the differential equation, assuming I have done the calculation and methodology correctly so far. If I have not done the correct methodology, I would appreciate some guidance on how to proceed with the problem.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus-of-variations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'optimization']"

2128277,smoothness of solution to heat equation + differentiation under integral sign,"I am reading Evan's PDE book, and I need some help understanding the following result [Theorem 1 on pg47 of the book] Let $g$ be continuous and essentially bounded function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $K$ be the heat kernel. Then, the function $u$ which is a convolution of $g$ and $K$ is $C^{\infty}$ . The proof of this theorem goes as: Since $K$ is infinitely differentiable, with uniformly bounded derivatives of all orders, on $[\delta, \infty)$ for each $\delta > 0$ , we see that $u$ is $C^{\infty}$ I am not really understanding this proof. (1) Am I correct that the uniform boundedness of derivatives of all orders means that: There exists a constant $M$ such that for every non-negative integer $\alpha$ and multi-index $\beta$ , $|\frac{\partial^\alpha}{\partial t^{\alpha}} D^{\beta} K(x,t)| \leq M$ for every $x$ and $t$ in $\mathbb{R}^n \times [\delta, \infty)$ ? If so, how do I know that the derivatives are uniformly bounded? I know that each derivative is bounded since $t\geq \delta > 0 $ , but how do I show the existence of the uniform constant $M$ ? (2) Why does the uniform boundedness of all derivatives allow us to differentiate under the integral sign? If I let $\Delta f_h$ to denote the difference quotient for the corresponding derivative $Df$ , then I can write $$\int |\Delta f_h(x-y)| g(y) dy =  \int |Df(x-y+c)| g(y) dy$$ for some $c$ between $x-y$ and $x-y+h$ by the mean value theorem, so I have as my dominating function $M |g(y)|$ where $M$ is the uniform bound constant, but since $g$ is only bounded and not necessarily integrable, so I cannot apply the dominated convergence theorem. What am I doing wrong? It was never intuiviely clear to me when differentiation under the integral is allowed and when it is not allowed. For example, (3) suppose that I have a function $f(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and assume further that we know $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,y)$ exists and is integrable in $y$ over $\mathbb{R}$ .

So from [1] and [5] we have $d=f=1.$ Then from [2] and [4] we obtain $ae=ce.$ Here $e=0$ leads to $b=0$ from either [2] or [4], and [3] then reads $a+c=0$, so that $p=a(x^2-1)$ which is reducible. So we may assume $e$ is nonzero, and also $a=c.$ At this point, [2] and [4] say the same thing, namely $ae+b=0.$ So we may replace $b=-ae$ in [3] (with its $c$ replaced by $a$) obtaining
  $a+(-ae)e+a=-ae,$ which on factoring gives $a(2-e)(e+1)=0.$ The possibility $e=2$ then leads after some algebra to $2a+b=0$ and $p=a(x-1)^2$ which is reducible, while the possibility $e=-1$ leads to $a=b$ and then $p=ax^2+ax+a$ as claimed.

This proves one direction of the theorem. $(\Leftarrow)$ We prove this implication by the contrapositive, as well. Assume $R$ has a strictly increasing chain of ideals $$I_1\subsetneqq I_2\subsetneqq \cdots$$
Let $I=\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^\infty I_k$. (I'm able to prove $I$ is an ideal easily, but I omit it here). Now I claim that $I$ is not finitely generated by showing that an arbitrary set of generators  $x_1,\dots,x_\ell$ does not generate $I$. I thought I could do this by choosing the minimum $n$ such that $I_n$ contains all the $x_i$, but I don't think this step is valid if $R$ does not have an identity element. Without  $1_R$, I'm unsure whether the ideals of the chain necessarily contain the generators of their union. Suggestions on how to get around this difficulty would be appreciated.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

My attempt: To show that the limits of both sequences exist, I think I should be using the Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT). For that I would need to show that the sequences are bounded. ($a_n$) is increasing, and so it should be bounded below. ($b_n$) is decreasing, so it should be bounded above. The challenge here is to show that ($a_n$) can be bounded above and ($b_n$) can be bounded below. This should utilise the third condition, from which I get: $$\begin{align*} 
& \lim_{n\to\infty}\,(b_n-a_n)=0 \\[3pt]
\iff & \forall\varepsilon>0,\ \exists N\in \mathbb{N} \text{ s.t. } \forall n\geq N,\ |{b_n-a_n}|<\varepsilon

Moreover, the method should be adapted to take the constraints into account. I have also tried to rewrite the problem as a functional optimization problem by assuming a differentiate function $f$ such that $f'(x) \geq 0$ and, thus, use some tool such as the Euler-Lagrange equation to deal with, but I stuck in the formulation of the problem. Insted of $(1)$, the problem can be generalized for any conditions $$g_n\left(f(x_i),f(x_j), f(x_k),\ldots\right) = 0,~~n=1,\ldots N.$$ and I am curious to know what kind of mathematical tool can be employed in these problems.

What will hapen to let's say the vector $(1,0,0)$ if it's passed through $T$? In my textbook, there was a short example that mentioned a reflection operator, which transformed a given vector $(a,b,c)$ to the vector $(a,b,-c)$ So that would be the reflection across the standard plane $x+y+z=0$, but here, will it act as if given a vector $(a,b,c)$ you get out a vector $(a,2b,-3c)$? EDIT:
after reading the comments, I got the matrix representation as: $T=\begin{bmatrix}1&-1&-1\\ 1&2&-2\\ -1&-1&-3\end{bmatrix}$ Now how can I find the representation of this operator in respect to the standard basis vectors $(e_1,e_2,e_3)$?

  and
  $$G=4X_0^2X_2-4X_0X_1^2+X_0X_1X_2-X_1^2X_2$$
  find for which of the cubics in $\Lambda$, the coordinate points $(1:0:0),(0:1:0),(0:0:1)$ are singular. Show if one of the coordinate points is an inflection point for some cubic in $\Lambda$. Show that $\Lambda$ can be generated by reducible cubics. Find how many tangents to $V(F)$ go through the point $(1:-4:0)$. For the first question, I just computed the partial derivatives of $F$ and $G$ and looked for which coordinate points, all the partial derivatives are zero. I found that $(1:0:0)$ is a singular point of multiplicity $2$ for both $V(F)$ and $V(G)$, but I'm not sure if that immediately proves that there isn't any other cubic in $\Lambda$ such that some other point isn't singular. For the second question, I computed the Hessian of $f$ and $G$ on the coordinate points that are not singular and I found that $(0:1:0)$ is an inflection point for $V(F)$ and $(1:0:0)$ is an inflection point for $V(G)$, but again, I'm not sure if that answers the question for all the cubics in $\Lambda$. Now, the question about proving that $\Lambda$ can be generated by reducible cubics, I simply have no idea about how to proceed. For the last, about the number of tangent lines to $V(F)$ that goes through the point $(1:-4:0)$, I remembered I read somewhere that I had to find the polar curve to that point and the intersecting with the curve, so that means finding the points that satisfy
$$F_0(X_0, X_1, X_2) - 4F_1(X_0,X_1,X_2) = 0$$
and
$$F(X_0,X_1,X_2)=0$$
but I don't know if this is correct, or if there's another way to find the tangent lines to a curve $C$ that go through a point $P$. Thank you in advance for your help! P.D. I'm assuming that the line at infinity on $\mathbb{P}_2$ is $X_0 = 0$ instead of $X_2 = 0$.","['algebraic-curves', 'tangent-line', 'algebraic-geometry']"
