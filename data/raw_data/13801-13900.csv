109081,Proving that $\mathbb C[C_7]\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^7\mathbb C$,"Let $R$ be the group ring $\mathbb C[C_7],$ where $C_7=\{1,g,\ldots,g^6\}$ is a cyclic group. I would like to prove that $$\mathbb C[C_7]\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^7\mathbb C.$$ I was thinking that I could use the following theorem: If $R$ is a commutative unital ring and $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are orthogonal idempotents in $R$, such that $\sum_{i=1}^ne_i=1,$  then $$R\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^ne_iR.$$ That would mean I have to find seven orthogonal idempotents $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^7$ with $$e_1+e_2+e_3+e_4+e_5+e_6+e_7=1,$$ such that $e_i R\cong \mathbb C.$ Is this the right way to do it? I've managed to find one idempotent $e\in R$ such that $eR = e\mathbb C.$ That is, I take $$e=\frac 17 (1+g+\cdots+g^6).$$ I have $$e^2=\frac 17 \cdot \frac 17(1+g+\cdots+g^6)(1+g+\cdots+g^6)=\frac 17\cdot \frac 17\cdot 7(1+g+\cdots+g^6)=e,$$ so $e$ is idempotent. For $\sum_{i=0}^6 r_ig^i\in R$, I have $$
\begin{eqnarray}
e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_ig^i&=&\frac 17(1+g+\cdots+g^6)(r_0+r_1g+\cdots+r_6g^6)\\
&=&\frac 17(r_0+r_1g+\cdots+r_6g^6\\
&\,& \;\;\,+r_6+r_0g+\cdots+r_5g^6 \\
&\,& \;\;\,\vdots\\
&\,& \;\;\,+r_1+r_2g+\cdots+r_0g^6)\\
&=&e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_i\in e\mathbb C,
\end{eqnarray}
$$
(where $\mathbb C$ denotes the natural copy of the field $\mathbb C$ contained in $R$). Every element of $e\mathbb C$ can be written as $e\sum_{i=0}^6 r_i$, so $eR=e\mathbb C.$ But I need $eR\cong \mathbb C.$ $e\mathbb C$ is not isomorphic to $\mathbb C,$ is it? The former doesn't have a unity, right? But even if I'm missing something very simple here and $eR\cong \mathbb C,$ then I still don't have seven idempotents -- just the one.

109092,"Conics in $\mathbb{A}^2$; Hartshorne, Exercise 3.1","I'm trying to solve Exercise 3.1 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry: Show that any conic in $\mathbb{A}^2$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1$ or $\mathbb{A}^1-\{0\}$. I know from a previous exercise that the coordinate ring of a given affine conic $Q$ is either isomorphic to $A(Z(y-x^2))\cong k[y]$ or $A(Z(xy-1))\cong k[x,1/x]$. In the first case clearly $A(Q)\cong A(\mathbb{A}^1)$. But how is $A(Q)\cong A(\mathbb{A}^1-\{0\})$ in the other case?
Somehow I even am confused with the notation $A(\mathbb{A}^1-\{0\})$, since the only varieties in $\mathbb{A}^1$ are single points and $\mathbb{A}^1$ itself. Therefore $\mathbb{A}^1-\{0\}$ isn't an affine variety, right? So how can I say, that $Q$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1-\{0\}$?

One or more of each kind in some order. This is how I have been imagining it to myself, but I was unable to find proof of this on the internet. Is this true? And if this is true, is there a way to find such a decomposition?

109110,Basic question about zeros and ideals,"These are problems from Miles Reid's book ""Undergraduate algebraic geometry"" Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Question 1. Let $I= (xy,xz,yz) \subset k[x,y,z]$. I want to find $Z(I)$ ok it is clear that $I$ is the union of the three coordinate axes, now I want to prove rigorously each coordinate axis is closed and irreducible. Can we simply say: For example the z-axis is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^{1}$. But any homeomorphism preserves closed sets and irreducible sets so since $\mathbb{A}^{1}$ is algebraic (i.e closed) and irreducible we are done. Question 2: Let $I=(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2},xy+xz+yz)$. Identify $Z(I)$ and $I(Z(I))$. I'm confused with this one because here in case the field is $\mathbb{R}$ then we get $x=y=z$ however $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraically closed so how do we proceed? Now I was thinking in using the identity $(x+y+z)^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+2(xy+xz+yz)$ from here we get that $x+y+z=0$. So it seems $Z(I)$ is the set of all points in the plane $x+y+z=0$. Is this wrong? But what if the underlying field has characteristic equal $2$? Finally how do we find $I(Z(I))$?",['algebraic-geometry']

109146,Combinatorial proof of arithmetic geometric mean inequality,"It is a well known fact that for positive reals $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, their arithmetic mean is no less than their geometric mean: $$ \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} \ge \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \dots x_n} $$ and has got a multitude of proofs. One proof approach (which I haven't seen, and what this question is about) would be to prove for the case when the numbers are positive integers. Then because of the homogenity, we can pass on to the rationals, and because rationals are dense, we move onto the reals, completing the proof. The inequality can be rewritten as $$ (x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n)^n \ge n^n x_1 x_2 \dots x_n$$ The left side can be interpreted as the number of $n$-tuples that can be formed by picking from $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n$ items with replacement. So this leads to the question: Can we give a combinatorial proof of the above (rewritten) inequality*, when the numbers involved are positive integers? If such a proof already exists, a reference would suffice. Please feel free to add answers even if they work for specific $n \gt 1$. *Combinatorial proofs for inequalities are not unheard of. For instance to prove that $2^n \gt n$, we count the total number of subsets of $\{1,2, \dots, n\}$ and compare with the number of subsets of size $1$.","['inequality', 'combinatorics']"
109151,Lipschitz Continuity of Linear Map Between Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces,"I am trying to show from first principles that a linear map $T:X \rightarrow Y$ between finite dimensional vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ is Lipschitz. I'm rather stuck and would appreciate a hint how I might continue the argument I have constructed so far: To show that $T$ is Lipschitz, it is necessary to show for $x,y \in U$ that $|T(x) - T(y)| \leq \lambda|x - y|$ for some $\lambda > 0$. If $u_1, \dots, u_n$ is a basis for $X$, there exists scalars $a^i, b^i$ such that $x = a^iu_i$ and $y=b^iu_i$. Therefore, $$
|T(x - y)| \leq |T(a^iu_i)| + |T(b^iu_i)| = |a^i|\cdot|T(u_i)| + |b^i|\cdot|T(u_i)| \leq k \sum_{i=1}^n|T(u_i)|
$$ where $$k = \max_{j=1, \dots n}|a^j + b^j|$$ So, I've succeeded in finding a bounds of sorts for $T$ but I'm not sure how to translate the bound $|T(u_i)|$ to $u_i$ and other than showing something rather obvious so far, I'm not really sure that the above argument gets me a lot closer to my goal.

(2 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Let $A, B$ be subsets of a metric space $X$. If $A$ is compact and $B$ is closed, show that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is achieved. Attempt at a proof: Let $A$ be compact and $B$ be closed. Let $m=d(A,B)=\inf_{b\in B} d(A,B)$. Then, there are two possibilities: (a) $\exists b\in B$, $d(a,b)=m$. If this is the case, we're done. (b) $\forall b\in B$, $d(a,b)>m$. In this case, there exists a sequence $\{b_n\}\subseteq B:$ $d(a,b_n)\rightarrow m$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ by definition of infinum. Then there exists a subsequence $\{b_{n_k}\}$: $d(b_{n_1},a)>d(b_{n_2},a)>...$ which is monotonic decreasing. Then note that $d(b_{n_k},a)<d(b_{n_1},a)<\infty$. So it's a bounded sequence. Now I want to show that it has a convergent subsequence that converges to $b\in B$ and then I want to do the same for $A$. And then finally to show that $d(a,b)=m$ in fact.

109177,Interpretation of a simple probabilistic term in a calculation,"I'm reading through my notes on the evolution of random graphs and have come unstuck trying to figure out the meaning of a probabilistic term which appears, and was hoping you could help - it's not very complex, I don't think. I'm working in the space of random graphs $G_{n,p}$; graphs on $n$ vertices with all edges having (independent) probability $p$ of existing. I'm in the final leg of a multi-part proof, and for this final part I want to show that the ""number of vertices on tree components"" is given by a random number satisfying a certain condition which I don't think needs specifying here, though I can do if it will help. We've specified $p = \frac{\gamma \log{n}}{n}$, where $\gamma$ is some number between $\frac{1}{k+1},\,2$ (and $k \geq 1$ is some value needed elsewhere in the proof). So, the line I can't understand is as follows, copied verbatim: $\mu_l = \mathbb{E}(\text{# vertices on } l\text{-tree components}); \sum_{2}^k \mu_l = 2 \sum {n\choose l} l^{l-2} ( \frac{\gamma \log{n}}{n})^{l-1} (1 - \frac{\gamma \log{n}}{n})^{ln}$. I'm unclear precisely what $\mu_l$ is actually meant to be defining the expectation of (the total number of vertices which lie in precisely one tree, of size exactly $l$, perhaps?), but am trying to deduce it from the sum. So, as far as I can figure things, we're saying $\mu_l = 2 {n \choose{l}} l^{l-2}p^{l-1} (1-p)^{ln}$: it looks to me like $n \choose l$ arises as the number of ways you can choose $l$ of the $n$ vertices of the graph, $l^{l-2}$ is the total number of possible trees on these $l$ vertices (Cayley's formula) and $p^{l-1}$ is the probability of having the $(l-1)$ edges of the tree on $l$ vertices, as occurring in the expectation - whatever it is actually an expectation of. However, I can't see where the factor of $2$ and the $(1-p)^{ln}$ come from: $(1-p)^j$  usually corresponds to fixing a certain number $j$ of edges as being not present in the graph, but for $j=nl$ that would suggest you want to have all possible edges from some $l$ vertices to some $n$ vertices not present; but $n$ vertices would of course be the entire graph, so that makes no sense. I wonder if it might be missing something, and should instead be (e.g.) $j=l(n-l)$? Are the notes copied down wrong (I don't think they are, my friend's notes are identical), or is it just a matter of understanding what this expectation is being taken of? Or perhaps my equals sign should be an 'approximately equals'. I'm sure it'll be obvious as soon as someone points out what I'm missing, so don't worry about going into excessive detail with any answers, just a brief explanation of what the term might mean would be warmly welcomed, if you have any better ideas than me.

109196,Lemma in deriving the winding number?,"I'm self-studying complex analysis, and in my book there are starred exercises on complex integration I'm interested in understanding.

It also rang a bell that integrating over $(a,b)$ is the opposite as integrating over $(b,a)$ (i.e. taking the inverse ""path"" over the line) and I'm guessing this also happens in complex integration, i.e, the path you take changes the value of the integral.

I am interested in the projection of $f$ onto the $\theta$ coordinate,
$f_\theta(\theta)=\int_0^\infty\int_0^{2\pi} f(\vec{r})r\sin\theta\,d\phi\,dr$. Using the euclidean distance formula $\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2}$ and substituting in the cartesian coordinates for $\vec{r}=(r,\theta,\phi)$ with 
$$x=r\cos\phi\sin\theta\;;\;y=r\sin\phi\sin\theta\;;\;z=r\cos\theta$$ and similarly for $\vec{r}_0$ with $$x_0=r_0\sin\theta_0\; ; \; y_0=0\;;\;z_0=r\cos\theta.$$ Then
$$f(\vec{r})=Ne^{(-r^2+2rr_0(\cos\phi\sin\theta\sin\theta_0+\cos\theta\cos\theta_0)-r_0^2)/A},$$ so 
$$f_\theta(\theta)=\int_0^\infty\int_0^{2\pi} Ne^{(-r^2+2rr_0(\cos\phi\sin\theta\sin\theta_0+\cos\theta\cos\theta_0)-r_0^2)/A}r\sin\theta\,d\phi\,dr.$$ Using the fact that $\int_0^{2\pi}e^{x\cos\phi}=2\pi I_0(x)$, where $I_0(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I can simplify $f_\theta(\theta)$ to 
$$f_\theta(\theta)=N\sin\theta2\pi e^{-r_0^2/A}\int_0^\infty e^{(-r^2+2rr_0\cos\theta\cos\theta_0)/A}I_0(2rr_0\sin\theta\sin\theta_0/A)r\,dr$$ Is there a way to evaluate this integral further?

109378,extending bipartite Graphs to regular bipartite Graphs,"I am working on this problem trying to show for a bipartite graph $G$ when given $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $k$ exceeds the degree of each vertex $v \in V(G)$ I can construct a new graph $G'$ simply by adding vertices and edges in such a way that I end up with a bipartite graph $G'$ in which each vertex has degree $d(v) = k$. I am wondering whether it should not be possible simply to extend the smaller part of the bipartition with vertices such that both parts end up having the same number of vertices.
( the step is superflous if the bipartitions already have the same cardinality in G, and without loss of generality I assume k < max{|X|,|Y|} because otherwise I ll just add vertices to each so they have cardinality k and I can embed G in the complete bipartite graph with degree k of each vertex ) Now since I want each vertex $v$ to have degree $k$ and since both parts of the bipartition now end up having the same number of vertices it would seem they have the same ""capacity"" for incoming edges from the other part of the partition respectively. Does this not mean that I will certainly be able to now add edges as needed to ensure each vertex has degree $k$ ? (i.e. I keep all the ""old"" edges from G and just add edges essentially pairing vertices in G' that still have insufficient degree) It would seem this way I can ensure I embed G into a bipartite G' such that G' is regular. (i.e. regular in the sense that it has vertices each of degree k) I think I m missing something... ctd.... OK, I think I see why my strategy will not generally work. Basically to keep it short we cannot be sure that the we can actually match up the ""capacity"" that I was talking of above. (tks and credit also at this point to the counterexample provided below !) I have a proposal how to fix the situation though: match capacity in G' as described above until you cannot continue. You will be left with a subset of vertices in X' and Y'  call them $X^-$ and $Y^-$ that do not have the required degree yet. The sum over the deficient degrees will be equal though, as outlined before. Call this sum $\Delta X = \Delta Y = \Delta $. (The only problem is we are not able to match them up anymore within G') Now add further vertices and edges so as to add $\Delta$ ""carbon"" copies of G'. You can now go through the vertices in $X^-$ and for each incoming edge that is missing you add 1 edge going to one of the copies. So doing this you get an edge from $X^-$ to each copy of $Y^-$. This cannot run into trouble, because you have capacity, and at the time when you add the edge the parts of the Graph are disconnected. Now $X^-$ is fixed. In a similar way you proceed for each copy of $X^-$ and at each step you ignore the respective copy of $Y^-$ that is in the same copy of G'. Since the sum over the whole spare capacity of the respective parts of the bipartition of the new extended Graph are again the same, and since you never try to add an edge between parts of the enlarged Graph that are already connected, this strategy should work.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

The proof: let $\mu$ be such measure, then for any $[a,b]$ such that $a<b$ it holds that $\mu([a,b]) = \infty$. To show it, we consider a bijection $f:[a,b]\to K$ where $K = [0,1]\times[0,1]$ and put

Basically my question is, is there an analytical approach to solve this problem? My approach: $\frac{1}{2}$ must be an element of the subset since $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{14}<1$. Using similar logic I also deduced that $\frac{1}{4}$ must be a member of the subset. However, after this, my approach was literally guesswork. I was lucky however and knew that $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{1}{4}$ which allowed me to solve the problem. However, the latter approach (the guesswork part) was only successful because the given set was small enough for a brute force approach and I was lucky to know $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{1}{4}$. If the set was bigger however, and lets say the sum of the elements of the subset had to be 99.5 instead of 1 it would take a lot longer to solve.

109600,"Why do free monoids have a ""trivial"" automorphism group and free groups don't?","Let $X$ be a set and $M$ the free monoid over $X$. Then an automorphism $f$ of $M$ satisfies $f(X)=X$ and so $\text{Aut}(M)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\mathfrak{S}_X$. My Proof : For every word $w\in M$, let $l(w)$ be the length of $w$. We can show by induction on $l(w)$ that $l(f(w))\geq l(w)$. Since the same is true for $f^{-1}$, we have $l(f(w))=l(w)$ and the special case $l(w)=1$ is all we need to finish the proof. I have almost no formal knowledge of category theory, but I try to think categorically whenever possible. Since the proposition above can be formulated in categorical language, I assumed there would be an easy proof using only the universal property of $M$. But then I realized that the analogous statement for groups is not true. For example, $\mathbf{Z}$, the free group over a one element set, has two automorphisms. The reason the above proof breaks down is that there we had a (monoid) homomorphism $l:M\rightarrow\mathbf{N}$ with $l(X)=\{1\}$, and such a mapping does not exist if $M$ is the free group over $X$. Questions: Is there a name for (a theory about) the property of categories that the automorphism groups of free objects coincide with the permutation groups of the underlying sets? Is there a ""deeper"" reason that the category of monoids has this property and the category of groups does not?","['category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'universal-algebra']"
109615,Understanding the proof that $L_\infty$ norm is equal to $\max\{f(x_i)\}$,"Attached is a proof I found. It is probably very basic, but I can not understand the marked thing. Why this term is zero? I hope someone can explain it for me. Edit(elaboration): A Norm is a function that takes a function $f$ and returns a number. Discreet norm's input is not the function itself but it's values at certain defined points. Each discreet norm has it's own set of points $\{x_i\}$ (and also weights $\{w_i\}$ ). There are some conditions it should follow to be called a norm (you can google it). Here, $f_i$ is short notation of $f(x_i)$, and the $L_p$ norm is defined as 
$$L_p \equiv (\sum{|f_i|^p w_i})^{1/p} $$ $|f_i|$ is simply absolute value. And of course $f$ should be defined at $\{x_i\}$ points. If we send $p$ to infinity then we get the infinity norm $L_\infty$.",['calculus']

109637,Uniform convergence of measures,"Let $A\subset[0,1]^n\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed semi-algebraic set. Let $f_k: [0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $f_k(x_i)=\mu^{n-1}(A_{|_{x_i}}+B^{n-1}_{1/k})$ where $A_{|_{x_i}}=A\cap H^i_{x_i}$ with $H^i_{x_i}$ the hyperplane orthogonal to the $i$-axis through $x_i$, $\mu^{n-1}$ the $n-1$-dimensional Lebesgue measure and $B^{n-1}_\varepsilon$ the $n-1$-dimensional $\varepsilon$-ball around zero.
I.e. for any $x_i \in [0,1]$ it measures the cross section of $A$ that is widened by an $\varepsilon$-ball. Show that $f_k$ converges uniformly to $f(x_i)=\mu^{n-1}(A_{|_{x_i}})$ for $x_i\in [0,1]$. $A_{|_{x_i}}$ is closed, so $A_{|_{x_i}}$ is the limit of $A_{|_{x_i}}+B^{n-1}_{1/k}$. From the properties of the Lebesgue measure we get that $f_k$ converges pointwise. But I have no idea how to prove uniform convergence. EDIT: Some more thoughts of mine:
The series above converges uniformly, if $f_k'(x_i)=\mu^{n-1}(A_{|_{x_i}}+B_{1/k}) -\mu^{n-1}(A_{|_{x_i}})$ converges uniformly to zero.
Since $f_k''(x_i)=\mu^{n-1}(\delta(A_{|_{x_i}})+B_{1/k})\ge f_k'(x_i)$ for all $x_i$ it would suffice that $f_k''$ converges uniformly to zero. Here, discontinuities of $f_k''$ are a problem. It seems that $f_k''$ is discontiuous in $x\in[0,1]$ iff the set-valued map $M^A:[0,1]\subset\mathbb{R}\rightrightarrows\mathbb{R}^{n-1}; M^A(x_i)=A_{|_{x_i}}$ is Hausdorff discontiuous in $x_i$. Uniform convergence should follow if $M^A$ is Hausdorff discontiuous in finitely many points only. $A$ is semi-algebraic. For a set defined by a single polynomial (in-) equality the number of discontinuities is finite. Does it stay finite under unions / intersections (complement seems obvious)?

109708,"Does $2x^2-1=y^5$ have a solution in integers, with $y>1$?","In my solution to this MSE problem , I noted that $2x^2-1=y^5$ is unlikely to have
solutions in integers with $y>1$. Recently, I've tried to find a proof, without success. Following Thomas Andrews's suggestion (see his solution to the same problem), we start by writing $1-2x^2=(-y)^5$. Working in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ we can factorize this 
as $$(1-x\sqrt{2})(1+x\sqrt{2})=\text{ a fifth power }.$$ 
After showing  that $1-x\sqrt{2}$ and $1+x\sqrt{2}$ are relatively prime
(always working in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$), the proposed equation 
would force $$1+x\sqrt{2}=u(a+b\sqrt{2})^5$$ for some integers $a,b$ and some unit $u$. The group of units in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is given by $\pm (1+\sqrt{2})^n$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$.
A minus sign could be absorbed into the fifth power, so we only need to show that 
$$1+x\sqrt{2}=(1+\sqrt{2})^\delta(a+b\sqrt{2})^5$$ for some integers $a,b$ and $0\leq \delta\leq 4$ forces $|x|\leq 1$. Here I am following the method 
described by Adrián Barquero in this MSE question for dealing with an infinite group of units. For $\delta=0$, it is pretty straightforward but for $\delta=1$, I'd need to show that 
$$1= a^5+20 a^3 b^2+20 a b^4+10 a^4b+40a^2b^3+8b^5$$ is not possible, excepting the 
trivial solution $a=1$ and $b=0$. I haven't made any progress with this, or the other 
similar expressions we get when $\delta=2,3,4$. I'm stuck here, and this problem seems to me to be as 
difficult as the original question. Question: Can the method outlined here be pushed through to give a full solution,
or does this problem require higher level approaches? I'm clearly out of my depth with algebraic number theory, so any suggestions or references that are suitable for amateurs will be greatly appreciated.

In the section Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients , it says the following: If the coefficients $A_i$ of the differential equation are real, then
  real-valued solutions are generally preferable. Since non-real roots $z$
  then come in conjugate pairs, so do their corresponding basis
  functions $x^ke^{zx}$, and the desired result is obtained by replacing each
  pair with their real-valued linear combinations $Re(y)$ and $Im(y$), where
  $y$ is one of the pair. I mean, why can you do this, that is, replace a pair of conjugate basis functions with their real and imaginary parts? The article gives as an example the equation $y'' -4y +5y = 0$. The roots of the characteristic equation are $2+i$ and $2-i$. Therefore, any solution of the equation will be of the form $c_1 e^{(2+i)x} + c_2 e^{(2-i)x}$ with $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{C}$. So far, so good. Then, one takes the real and imaginary parts of $e^{(2+i)x}$, so that any solution of the differential equation will be a linear combination of them, that is, $y = a_1e^{2x}\cos x + a_2e^{2x}\sin x$, with $a_1, a_2 \in  \mathbb{R}$. I don't understand the last step. You have a pair of complex functions, wich are conjugates of each other (because the characteristic equation has real coefficients), that form a basis of the space of solutions of the equation. Then, you claim that you can instead take the real and imaginary parts of one of them (it doesn't matter which one, since they are conjugates), and they will form a basis.

109818,A riddle about guessing hat colours (which is not among the commonly known ones),"This is a riddle I heard recently, and my question is if someone happens to know the solution. I'm asking this out of curiosity more than anything else. So here it is. The riddle is one of the countless variations of the ""prisoners have to guess their hat colour"" puzzle. $n$ prisoners are put a hat on top of their head, which can be red or blue. The colours are chosen at random by $n$ independent fair coin tosses. Then each prisoner can guess their own hat colour (red or blue) or pass. The prisoners can see each other, but not hear each other's calls and of course they have no other means of communication. This means that each call can only depend on the other prisoners' hat colours. However, before the distributing of hats begins, the prisoners are told the rules and can agree on a strategy. The prisoners win iff no prisoner guesses wrong and at least one prisoner guesses right. Which strategy should the prisoners use so that the winning probability becomes maximal? Some remarks: A simple strategy is that one player just guesses and all other players pass, so that the maximal probabilty is at least 1/2. For $n=2$ this strategy is optimal. For $n=3$, there is a strategy that wins in 6 out of 8 cases: When a player sees (red,red) he guesses blue, for (blue,blue) he guesses red, and otherwise he passes. More generally this shows that the maximal probability is at least 3/4 for $n\ge 3$. It's possible to show that any strategy fails for at least 2 hat colour configurations (unless $n=1$), which shows that the above strategy is optimal for $n=3$. For $n=4$ there are more than $10^{15}$ strategies, and for $n=5$ it's about $10^{38}$ strategies, making it quite infeasible to just use a brute-force computer program (maybe for $n=4$ it's possible when exploiting the obvious symmetries). When changing the rules slightly by forbidding players to pass, then the maximal winning probability is always 1/2. This is a nice little exercise. Actually I heard the riddle only for $n=3$ and then thought about the general $n$. So it's entirely possible that there is no nice solution.","['puzzle', 'probability']"

I have attempted to generalize this (in what seems like the obvious way) and would appreciate it if someone could confirm the validity (or lack thereof) of my ""conjecture"". Let $G$ be a group with $|G|=p^nq^m$ where $p$, $q$ are distinct primes and $n, m \ge 1$.  Furthermore, assume that $p \not\mid q^k-1$ and $q \not\mid p^k-1$ for $1 \le k \le m$ and $1 \le k \le n$, respectively.  Then $G$ is abelian. Proof: Every divisor of $|G|$ is of the form $p^sq^t$ with $0 \le s \le n$ and $0 \le t \le m$.  If $s \ne 0$ then $p\mid p^sq^t$ so that $p^sq^t \equiv 0 \,\,\mbox{mod}\,p$, and similarly if $t \ne 0$ then $p^sq^t \equiv 0 \,\,\mbox{mod}\,q$.  Therefore we will now assume that $s=0$ or $t=0$.  Let $1 \le k \le n$.  If $p \not\mid q^k-1$ for all $k$, then $q^k \not\equiv 1 \,\, \mbox{mod}\,p$ and if $q \not\mid p^k-1$ for all $k$ then $p^k \not\equiv 1\, \mbox{mod} \,q$.  Therefore $1$ is the only divisor of $|G|$ that is congruent to $1 \,\mbox{mod}\,p$ and $1 \, \mbox{mod}\,q$. It follows by Sylow's Third Theorem that $G$ has only one Sylow $p$-subgroup and one Sylow $q$-subgroup.  In addition, each of these subgroups is normal.  Clearly the order of their product is $|G|$ and they intersect trivially.  Furthermore, it can be shown (see proof of Theorem 24.6 in Contemporary Abstract Algebra, Gallian, 5th ed.) that all elements in these subgroups commute.  Therefore, $G$ is abelian.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

If $f(z)$ has two or more distinct roots, then $\prod_{i=0}^{N}f^{(r)}(z)$ has at least $N+1$ distinct roots. This result does not seem to generalize easily to algebraically closed fields with characteristic $0$.","['algebraic-topology', 'abstract-algebra']"
109862,The measure$<\varepsilon$ condition in Egoroff's theorem: necessary or not?,"Here is a statement of Egoroff's Theorem: Egoroff's Theorem. Suppose that $\mu(X) < \infty$, and $f, f_1, f_2, f_3, \ldots$ are all measurable complex-valued functions on $X$ such that $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere. Then for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $E \subseteq X$ such that $\mu(E) < \varepsilon$ and $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $E^c$ (the complement of $E$ in $X$). Is it possible to replace the ""$\mu(E) < \varepsilon$"" condition by ""$\mu(E) = 0$"" in the statement and still have the theorem be true? I suspect that the answer is no, but I am having trouble thinking of an appropriate counterexample.",['measure-theory']
109870,Concave functions on discrete domain,"We are given a positive, non-decreasing function $f$ defined on natural numbers with $f(0) = 0$. $f$ has a submodularity-like property: $f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y) $ for all natural numbers $x$ and $y$. Can we then show that for any natural numbers $x,y$,  we have $f(x) \geq \frac{x}{x+y}f(x+y)$?","['special-functions', 'convex-analysis', 'inequality', 'discrete-mathematics']"
109890,"How to find an ellipse , given 2 passing points and the tangents at them?","Please answer to a question , how to find an ellipse which passes the 2 given points and has the given tangents at them. And one related question is that the given condition can decide just one ellipse which satisfies it? Thank you in advance. Edit : May be , I can say the first answer (by Mr. André Nicolas) is for the general case. Is there no special case where only a finite set of ellipses satisfies the condition? Edit : According to the answers and comments , I can compute an arbitrary chosen ellipse for my condition (using the method by Mr.Patrick Da Silva). But there are possibly many others which satisfy my conditions. Am I right?","['geometry', 'conic-sections']"

I want to find the power series solutions about the origin of two linearly independent solutions of $$w''-zw=0.$$ Also, how do I show that these solutions are analytic? thanks.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'complex-analysis']"
109904,Is finding the length of the shortest addition chain for a number $n$ really $NP$-hard?,"I spent a few hours today working through the addition chain problem.  Given the starting number 1, how many additions are required to get to some target natural number n?  For example, to make 5, we need three additions: 1 + 1 = 2 2 + 2 = 4 4 + 1 = 5 To make 15, we need five: 1 + 1 = 2 1 + 2 = 3 3 + 3 = 6 3 + 6 = 9 9 + 6 = 15 On the Wikipedia page for addition chains there is a citation that shows that finding an addition chain of some length that has to pass through a series of values is known to be $NP$-complete.  However, I can't seem to find a reference anywhere that suggests that the addition chain problem starting purely from 1 is known to be $NP$-hard or not.  Is it known whether or not this problem is $NP$-hard?  Or is this still an open problem? Thanks!","['np-complete', 'reference-request', 'combinatorics']"
