My work:
$$z=g(x,y)=-x-y$$

738357,Gilbarg Trudinger: Hölder continuity in chapter 8,"I'm trying to track the behaviour of the coefficients in Theorems 8.22 and Theorem 8.24. Particularly, I'm considering the behaviour w.r.t. to the distance from $\Omega'$ to $\partial \Omega$
I'll state an abbreviated version of theorem 8.22 Theorem 8.22 If $u\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ is a weak solution of a linear elliptic pde in divergence form in $\Omega$, then $u$ is locally Hölder continuous in $\Omega$ and for any Ball $B_{R_0}(y)\subset \Omega$ and $R\leq  R_0$ we have
  $$ \text{osc}_{B_R(y)}(u)\leq CR^\alpha(R_0^{-\alpha} \sup_{B_{R_0}(y)} |u| +k)$$
  where $C=C(R_0)$ and $\alpha=\alpha(R_0)$ Theorem 8.24 gives an estimate on the Hölder norm for compact sets $\Omega'\subset\subset \Omega$ of the form
$$||u||_{C^\alpha(\Omega')}\leq C (||u||_{L^2(\Omega)}+k)\tag{1}$$
where $C$ and $\alpha$ both depend on the distance of $\Omega'$ to $\partial \Omega$ and $k$ doesn't bother me :). What I discovered, when proving the local Hölder continuity of $u$ in Theorem 8.22 from the oscillation estimate is that the $C$ for the estimate (1) also depends on the size of $\Omega '$. Has anybody already considered this? Why do I believe this? Let $\Omega'\subset \Omega$ and choose $R_0$ so small that $B_{R_0}(\Omega')\subset \Omega$ (Hence the dependence on the distance of the boundary).
The oscillation estimates does only hold on balls. Hence, due to compactness we find a finite covering of $\Omega'$ consisting of balls $B_{R}(x_k)$, $k=1,...n$. To show local Hölder continuity fix $x,y\in\Omega'$
and compute (in the worst case, i.e. x,y not in the same ball, i.e. $|x-y|>R$) and $1\leq l\leq n$, 
$$|u(x)-u(y)|\leq |u(x)-u(x_1)|+ ... + |u(x_l)-u(y)| \leq C lR^{\alpha}\leq  C n|x-y|^\alpha \tag{2}$$
(I negelected $k$
Now $n$ depends obviously on the covering, so in particular on the radius $R$ which depends on $R_0$. However, the number $n$ depends on the size of $\Omega'$ and $R$. So the question is : Is there another way to show estimate $(2)$ without using the size of the domain? Is my covering argument wrong? Edit: Or is there another way to show the local Hölder continuity, starting  from the oscillation estimate? Edit2: In addition, it is stated that the constants $C$ and $\alpha$ are independent of $R_0$ and $R$ in the case of the Laplace-operator and that consequently the constant $C$ in $(1)$ shall be independent of the shape $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$.

I've been reading Conway's ""Functions of One Complex Variable"", and encountered following exercise in the book (p. 17). $X$ here is a metric space and $d$ is the metric of it. Show that if $F\subset X$ is closed and connected then for every pair of points $a,b$ in $F$ and each $\epsilon>0$ there are points $z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{n}$ in $F$ with $z_{0}=a, z_{n}=b$ and $d(z_{k-1},z_{k})<\epsilon$ for $1\leq k\leq n$. Is the hypothesis that $F$ be closed needed? If $F$ is a set which satisfies this property then $F$ is not necessarily connected, even if $F$ is closed. Give an example to illustrate this.

738574,Computing $\int_0^\pi \sin(x) \; dx$ using the definition.,"A colleague of mine and I, in the course of teaching integral calculus for the umpteenth time, were wondering if we could expand the class of examples that our students are exposed to when computing Riemann integrals from the definition. Most such examples involve polynomial functions, and they work nicely because we have some well-known formulas, like $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n$, $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. (And certainly, there are others.) But we wanted to expand the class of examples beyond polynomial functions, and started to think about trig functions. We came up with a computation for $\int_0^\pi \sin(x)\;dx$ using the definition of the Reimann integral, which I provide below. Question: Is the computation below in the literature somewhere? If so, where? Computation : Using a Riemann sum with right endpoints, we have $$\int_{0}^\pi \sin(x)\; dx = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \sin(x_i) \Delta x$$
where $\Delta x = \frac{\pi}{n}$ and $x_i = i\Delta x$. The trick is to rewrite the Riemann sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \sin(x_i) \Delta x$ as a telescoping sum using the difference of cosines identity:
$$\cos(b) - \cos(a) = 2 \sin\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)$$ Setting $a = \frac{2i+1}{2}\Delta x$ and $b = \frac{2i-1}{2}\Delta x$ yields $$\cos\left(\frac{2i-1}{2}\Delta x\right) - \cos\left(\frac{2i+1}{2}\Delta x\right) = 2 \sin\left(i \Delta x\right) \sin\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)$$ Solving for $\sin(i \Delta x)$ gives $$\sin(i \Delta x) = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{2i-1}{2}\Delta x\right) - \cos\left(\frac{2i+1}{2}\Delta x\right)}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)}$$ The Riemann sum now is
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \sin(i \Delta x) \Delta x = \frac{\frac{\Delta x}{2}}{\sin\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[\cos\left(\frac{2i-1}{2}\Delta x\right) - \cos\left(\frac{2i+1}{2}\Delta x\right)\right]$$ The latter sum is telescoping, and so
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \sin(i \Delta x) \Delta x = \frac{\frac{\Delta x}{2}}{\sin\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)}\left[ \cos\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{2n+1}{2}\Delta x\right)\right]$$ Now recalling that $\displaystyle \Delta x = \frac{\pi}{n}$ and taking $n \to \infty$ we have $\begin{align} \int_0^\pi \sin(x)\;dx &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\frac{\Delta x}{2}}{\sin\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right)}\left[ \cos\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{2n+1}{2}\Delta x\right)\right]\\
& =  1 \cdot \left[ \cos(0)-\cos(\pi)\right]\\
& = 2
\end{align}$ One nice thing about this computation is that you can replace $\pi$ with an arbitrary upper limit of integration $c$ and compute that $\int_0^c \sin(x) \;dx = 1 - \cos(c)$.
From there, one can easily compute
$$\int_a^b \sin(x) \; dx = \int_0^b \sin(x) \; dx - \int_0^a \sin(x) \; dx = -\cos(b) + \cos(a)$$
(as predicted by FTC). Question: Is the computation above in the literature somewhere? If so, where?","['calculus', 'reference-request']"

Second, the left hand side shows up if one calculates $\Delta (e^{-2u})$. Looking at the result of the substitution, I'm not sure if this helps. For context, the quantity on the left side of the equation above is the sectional or Gauss curvature of a metric which is conformal by the factor $e^{2u}$ to the standard Euclidean metric on the plane.

738797,Is the distribution of a product of M iid uniform random variables really Log Normal?,"Conventional wisdom says yes or mostly.  But consider the following simple derivation: Let $y = \prod_{i=1}^M x_i$ where $x_i\sim U(0,1)$.  Then from independence, $E[y] = 2^{-M}$. Now, if we let $z = \ln y = \sum_{i=0}^M \ln x_i$ we can use the central limit theorem to claim that $z\sim Norm(\mu=-M,\sigma^2 = M)$ where we get $\mu = M \int_0^1 \ln x dx = -M$ and $\sigma^2 = M\int_0^1 (\ln x + 1)^2 dx = M$ from the standard change-of-variable equations for $\ln x$ combined with the CLT.  This leads to a Log-Normal distribution of y as:
$$f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi M}}e^{-\frac{(\ln y +M)^2}{2M}} $$
Great! We got a distribution for $y$.  But if you try and calculate the expectation now, you get $e^{\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}} = e^{-M/2} \neq 2^{-M}$.  What's worse, if you look at the asymptotic behavior, $e^{-M/2} \gg 2^{-M}$ as $M\rightarrow \infty$. This doesn't make sense to me.  How can $z$ be considered ""normal"" in the limit of large numbers if it leads to a divergent systematic deviation in the calculation of the expectation of $y$? Is this an artifact of the finite support in $x_i$? If so, how to take it into account? More importantly, if $y$ is not really Log-Normal, to what degree are calculations of other properties valid?

739106,Gel'fand representation of a non-unital Banach space: what's wrong with this argument,"My argument below is hacked together from pages 5-6 of Davidson's ""$C^*$ algebras by example"". Theorem: The multiplicative linear functionals on a unital abelian Banach algebra are continuous of norm 1. Proof: Let $\varphi$ be a multiplicative linear functional on $\mathfrak A$, and $A \in \mathfrak A$. Suppose towards a contradiction that $\|A\| < \varphi(A)$; by considering instead $A'=A/\varphi(A)$ if necessary, we can assume $\varphi(A)=1$.  Let $B = \sum_{n \geq 1} A^n$; then $A+AB=B$, and as a result, $\varphi(B)=\varphi(A)+\varphi(A)\varphi(B)=1+\varphi(B)$, which is nonsense. So $\|\varphi\| \leq 1$. Since $\varphi(I)=1$, that's an equality. If $\mathfrak A$ is non-unital, it seems to me the early part of that argument still applies, so that $\|\varphi\| \leq 1$. In either case $\mathfrak{A}$ is a subspace of the unit ball in $\mathfrak{A}^*$. We topologize the set of multiplicative linear functionals $\mathcal{M_{\mathfrak A}}$ as a subspace of the dual space $\mathfrak A^*$. Now weak-* convergence of nets is just pointwise convergence. As a result it's clear that the weak-* limit of multiplicative linear functionals is a multiplicative linear functional. (As is standard in mathematics, the part where I say 'it's clear' is where I think there's likeliest to be a problem.) So $\mathcal{M_{\mathfrak A}}$ is a closed subset of the unit ball of $\mathfrak A^*$; Banach-Alaoglu says that it's compact. On the other hand, I know that $\mathcal{M_{\mathfrak A}}$ is not compact for $\mathfrak A$ non-unital, but rather only locally compact. So something in the above argument is wrong. What is it? As mentioned, I think it's the ""clear"" bit. Because we can extend the 0 functional in a unique way, and every other functional extends uniquely, it seems likely to me that there's a net of multiplicative functionals that weak-* converge to the 0 functional. I'd like to see such a net. (It actually is clear in the unital case: since the functionals have norm 1, they're bounded away from the 0 functional, so this can't happen. They're not bounded away from the 0 functional in the non-unital case, so this is almost certainly the failure of this argument.","['operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

Second, it seems to me that the problem states that it is possible for two fields to be a field extension of the other but they are not the same(since $K$ is proper). Is it correct?

The residents like forming clubs, and we have clubs $C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_m \subseteq V$. We are interested in the maximum number of clubs $m$ that can be formed. There are some rules regarding clubs: No two clubs are identical: all clubs are distinct. A club must have an even number of members. $\forall i, |C_i|$ is even. Any pair of two clubs shares an even number of members: $\forall i \neq j, |C_i \cap C_j|$ is even. It follows from rule 1 that $m \leq 2^n$, as the set of all possible clubs is simply the power set of $V$. Then it follows from rule 2 that $m \leq 2^{n-1}$, as the rule eliminates all odd subsets of $P(V)$. We note as a lemma that for a finite set $A$, exactly half the subsets of $P(A)$ are of odd cardinality.

Here are the definitions I have to work with (from Rudin's Principles of Analysis): A set is $\mu$-measurable if it is the union of a countable collection of finitely $\mu$-measurable sets. For example, if $A=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ and each $A_n$ is finitely $\mu$-measurable, then A is $\mu$-measurable. Now, a set $A$ is finitely $\mu$-measurable if there is sequence of elementary sets ${A_n}$ such that $\lim_{n \mathop \to \infty} d(A,A_n)=0$. An elementary set is a union of finitely many bounded intervals of the real line; for example, $[0,1]\cup (1,2)\cup [2,3)\cup (3,2]$ is an elementary set; notice how the bounded intervals may be open, closed, or half open/half closed. Here, $d(A,A_n)=\mu^*(S(A,A_n))$, where $S(A,A_n)=(A-A_N)\cup (A_n-A)$, or the symmetric difference between two sets. Finally, $\mu^*$ is the outer measure of set. Specifically: for any real set E, $\mu^*(E)=\inf(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_n))$, where $\mu$ is any real, additive, non-negative, finite, and regular set function defined over the set of all elementary sets, and where the infimum is taken over all the countable covers of E consisting of open elementary sets. More specifically: a regular set function is function $\mu$ such that for any elementary set $A$ and for any $\epsilon >0$, there exist elementary sets $F$ and $G$ such that $F\subset A\subset G$, $F$ closed and $G$ open, and $\mu(G)-\epsilon \le \mu(A) \le \mu(F)+\epsilon$. And by a countable cover of $E$ consisting of elementary sets I mean $E\subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n$, where each $E_n$ is an open elementary set.

Different parameter values often lead to different numbers of events. How can I compare the Poissonness of the event timings across my parameter space? Is there a standard approach? I am not looking for a single ""best"" parameter; I want to make a figure that shows how the Poissonness depends on the parameter choice. By ""Poissonness"" I mean the degree to which the output resembles that of a Poisson process, i.e. the degree to which the inter-event times are distributed according to an exponential distribution. My approaches and their weaknesses Originally, I just looked at the coefficient of variation of the inter-event interval. For a perfect Poisson process, this is near 1, but being near 1 does not mean we have a Poisson process. I then thought I would try fitting an exponential curve to the top midpoints on a bar graph, but that seems unjustified and in any case loses information by aggregating data. To avoid losing information, I could use the maximum likelihood estimate and quantify the Poissonness according to the likelihood. The problem here is that the likelihood is linked to the number of events, so I cannot directly compare likelihoods from different event trains. I can take the $n$th root of the likelihood (where $n$ is the number of events); intuitively this feels fair, but I'm not sure if it is statistically justified.

739581,"cartesian product $A^2 = A$, possible?","Do there exist non-empty sets $A$ such that $A\times A = A$? $A\times A = A$ looks a little strange to me, since $A\times A$ seems somehow more complicated than $A$, hence it is unlike that they are equal, but then, I cannot think of any reason why there should not be such a (non-empty) set.",['elementary-set-theory']
739610,Prime Spectrum of A Ring,"I was given the definition that the spectrum of a ring R, denoted Spec R, is the set of the prime ideals of R. Then for an arbitrary subset $S \subseteq R$, then $V(S) = \{P \in SpecR | S \subseteq R \}$. I am confused by what a set of ideal would mean. Here it seems that this is a variety--but that does not make sense to me. Could someone please explain? Thank you!","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

739741,What is the difference between a density and a distribution in formal mathematical terms?,"A similar question has been already asked but its not in mathematical framework and therefore seems to be different. According to definitions from the book that I am reading, a random variable and a distribution are defined as follows: Definition. Let $(\Omega', \mathcal{A}')$ be a measurable space and let $X:\Omega\to\Omega'$ be measurable. Then $X$ is called a random variable . Definition. Let $X$ be a random variable. The probability measure $P_X:=P\circ X^{-1}$ is called the distribution . Now according to what I see in physical textbooks there is some other thing called density and that differs from distribution. How that one is formally defined?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'random-variables']"
