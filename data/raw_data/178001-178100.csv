If we cannot skip, then why is it that $\int_X F^{*}(d\omega) = 0$ ?

See here: Why is there a form with compact support on a connected oriented manifold with integral one but with support contained in a given open proper subset?

3217434,Spherical Gaussian MLE,"I am having trouble doing a derivation. I want to find the MLE estimate of $\sigma^2$ in a spherical gaussian, i.e when we have set $\Sigma = \sigma^2I$ . I have already seen https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238199/mle-of-multivariate-normal-distribution-with-diagonal-covariance-matrix but wanted to do the derivation more thoroughly. Say that we have $m$ points, and that our data consists of $p$ -features. We then know that the log likelihood of a multivariate gaussian is (from https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/351549/maximum-likelihood-estimators-multivariate-gaussian/351550 ) $$l(\mu, \Sigma )  = - \frac{mp}{2} \log (2 \pi) - \frac{m}{2} \log |\Sigma|  - \frac{1}{2}  \sum_{i=1}^m  \mathbf{(x^{(i)} - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x^{(i)} - \mu) }  $$ Now, inserting the fact that $\Sigma = \sigma^2I$ we have that $|\Sigma| = |\sigma^2 I| = (\sigma^2)^p$ , we get that $$l(\mu, \sigma^2 )  = - \frac{mp}{2} \log (2 \pi) - \frac{mp}{2} \log \sigma^2  - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}  \sum_{i=1}^m  \mathbf{(x^{(i)} - \mu)^T (x^{(i)} - \mu) }$$ Deriving based on $\sigma^2$ we get that $$\frac{\partial l}{\partial \sigma^2} = -\frac{mp}{2}\frac{1}{\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2} \sum_{i=1}^m  \mathbf{(x^{(i)} - \mu)^T (x^{(i)} - \mu) }$$ Setting the derivative to 0 we get that $$\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{mp} \sum_{i=1}^m  \mathbf{(x^{(i)} - \mu)^T (x^{(i)} - \mu) } $$ But this is not the same as other results I have found online (for example https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238199/mle-of-multivariate-normal-distribution-with-diagonal-covariance-matrix which I think argue that $\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m  \mathbf{(x^{(i)} - \mu)^T (x^{(i)} - \mu) }$ and http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/gaussians.pdf which states that it should equal the MLE from the univariate case).

3217451,How can one define the pullback of a metric $g$ from that of 2-forms?,"Let $M,N$ be smooth manifolds of dimensions $m,n$ respectively and $\phi:M\to N$ be a smooth map. Let $g$ be a metric on $N$ . If $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are local coordinates on $M$ and $N$ respectively then the metric takes the form: $$g=g_{ij}dy^i\otimes dy^j,\;\;\;\;\;i,j=1,\ldots,m.$$ How can one define the pullback of $g$ given that I know the pullback of 2-forms (and $k$ -forms in general)? My Try Lets work with 2 forms for simplicity. The pullback of a two form $\alpha$ is defined to be $$F^*(\alpha)(v_1,v_2)=\alpha(F_*v_1,F_*v_2),$$ where $v_1,v_2$ are tangent vectors at some point $p\in M$ and $F_*$ is the pushforward map. Now suppose that $\alpha=\beta\otimes\gamma$ where $\beta,\gamma$ are 1-forms on $N$ . Using the above I can define the map $$F^*(\beta\otimes\gamma)(v_1,v_2)=(\beta\otimes\gamma)(F_*v_1,F_*v_2)=\beta(F_*v_1)\cdot\gamma(F_*v_2).$$ But $\beta(F_*v_1)=F^*\beta(v_1)$ and $\gamma(F_*v_2)=F^*\gamma(v_2)$ and $$ (F^*\beta\otimes F^*\gamma)(v_1,v_2)=F^*\beta(v_1)\cdot F^*\gamma(v_2)$$ so that I get $$ F^*(\beta\otimes\gamma)=F^*\beta\otimes F^*\gamma.$$ Which looks like a 2-form on $M$ . So given this $$F^*(g)=F^*(g_{ij}dy^i\otimes dy^j)=(g_{ij}\circ F)\;F^*(dy^i)\otimes F^*(dy^j)=(g_{ij}\circ F)\frac{\partial F^i}{\partial x^k}dx^k\otimes\frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^\ell}dx^\ell,$$ which looks like a metric.

Let $\stackrel{\sim}\phi$ be a coordinate chart on $\operatorname{graph}(f)$ such that $\stackrel{\sim}\phi(p,f(p)) = \phi(p)$ on $U\times V$ and thus $\operatorname{graph}(f)$ is a manifold? b) Use (a) to show that $F: X\rightarrow \operatorname{graph}(f)$ is a diffeomorphism.

Thus $F$ is a diffeomorphsim but wanted to check how to use (a) to prove the same. I can again define a coordinate chart $\stackrel{\sim}\phi(p,f(p)) = \phi(p)$ on $\operatorname{graph}(f)$ and thus $\phi^{-1}\circ F \circ \stackrel{\sim}\phi(x) = x$ which is smooth and thus $F$ is smooth?

3217592,Darboux integrability implies Riemann integrability,"I have searched the site for posts regarding Darboux integrability $\implies$ Riemann integrability, but haven't found any that specifically adress this question.

I know how to find an extension $\omega:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ of $\left. \varphi \right|_{U}$ such that $\varphi'(0) + \beta$ where $\beta \in \mathcal C_b^0 (\mathbb{R}^2)$ is Lipschitz with bounded constant by $\varepsilon$ .

How do I constructed the function $\omega$ Define $F= \varphi$ and $L = \mathrm{d} \varphi(0)$ . First, choose a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ real function $\beta:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying: $\beta(x) = 0 $ , $\forall$ $x$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} \setminus [-1,1]$ . $\beta(x) =1$ , $\forall$ $x$ $\in$ $ \left[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right].$ $\beta (x)$ is a increasing function in $\left[-1,-\frac{1}{2}\right]$ and $\beta(x)$ is a decreasing function in $\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]$ . Note that, $\beta$ is compact support $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ , so, there exists $M$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ , such that, $M = \sup \{|D\beta(x)|; \hspace{0.1cm} x \in \mathbb{R}\} $ . We define $\phi: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ as $\phi(x) = F(x) - Lx$ . Observe that the function $\phi$ is a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ , moreover, $D\phi(0) = 0$ . Therefore, for the real number $\widetilde{\varepsilon} = \min\left\{ \frac{\varepsilon}{2M} , \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right\} > 0$ there exists $1 \geq r >0$ such that $$x \in B_r (0) \subset U \Rightarrow \Vert D\phi(x) \Vert < \widetilde{\varepsilon} $$ implying, by the mean value theoream that, if $x \in B_r (0)  \Rightarrow \Vert \phi(x) \Vert < \widetilde{\varepsilon}\Vert x\Vert $ . Now, consider $\omega: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ defined as: $$\omega(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
	Lx + \beta\left(\frac{\Vert x \Vert}{r}\right)\phi(x), \hspace{0.1cm} \text{if} \hspace{0.1cm} x \in U,\\

3218019,Evaluating the limit of a sum using integration,"One of the first results we learn in definite integral is that if $f(x)$ is Riemann integrable in $(0,1)$ then we have $\lim_{n \to \infty}\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f\Big(\dfrac{i}{n}\Big) = \int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx$ . I was playing around with this to see if this can be generalized and I found the following. We can rewrite the above result as $$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{1}{1+1+\ldots\text{$n$-times}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}1\times f\Big(\frac{1+1+\ldots\text{$i$-times}}{1+1+\ldots\text{$n$-times}}\Big) = \int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx.

3218328,Circles generated by three-fold iterations $f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}$,"I came across a weird property of the function $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{(1-x)}$ Observe the following: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)}, \quad\quad f^2(x) = f(f(x)) = \frac{(x-1)}{x}, \quad\quad
f^3(x) = f(f(f(x))) = x$$ ultimately implying that $f^2(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ . (Mini question: Do you know of any other functions $g(x)$ where $g \circ (g \circ g(x)) = g^3(x)=x$ aside from $f(x)$ and aside from the trivial case where $g(x)=x$ ? I was pretty shocked when I noticed this pattern with $f(x)$ .) Anyway, notice for every $x$ , there is a set of triplets generated by repeatedly applying the function $f(x)$ . Specifically $\langle x\rangle =\{x,f(x),f^{-1}(x)\}=\{x,\frac{1}{(1-x)},\frac{(x-1)}{x}\}$ For an illustrative example let $x=2$ , so then $\langle 2\rangle=\{2, -1, \frac{1}{2}\}$ . See now that this can be thought of as 3 points on the graph of the function $f(x)$ , where Point $A$ : $x \mapsto f(x)$ Point $B$ : $f(x) \mapsto f^{2}(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ Point $C$ : $f^{-1}(x) \mapsto x$ Explicitly, still using $x=2$ as the example: Point $A$ : $(x, f(x)) = (2,-1)$ Point $B$ : $(f(x), f^{-1}(x)) = (-1,\frac{1}{2})$ Point $C$ : $(f^{-1}(x),x) = (\frac{1}{2},2)$ OK so now my question! Since 3 points uniquely define a circle, I'd like to know if we can derive a closed-form function $r(x)$ that calculates the radius of circle $R$ , where circle $R$ is the circle uniquely defined by the 3 points $A$ , $B$ and $C$ generated by $\langle x\rangle$ . Continuing the example where $x=2$ , circle $R$ has center at Point $R=(\frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{4})$ (i.e. the circumcenter of points $A$ , $B$ and $C$ ). The radius of circle $R$ is then simply: $$|\overline{AR}|=\sqrt{{\left(2-\frac{3}{4}\right)}^2+{\left(-1-\frac{1}{4}\right)}^2}= \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}.$$ So evaluating $r(x)$ at $x=2$ gives us $r(2)=\dfrac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}\approx1.76777$ . Another cool example to consider is $x=\phi$ , where $\phi=\dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx1.61803$ (the Golden Ratio). Some cool characteristics that make $\phi$ unique among all numbers are: $$\phi-1=\frac{1}{\phi}\quad\text{and}\quad \phi+1=\phi^2$$ You can calculate this on your own, but applying $f(x)$ on $x=\phi$ repeatedly results in $\langle\phi\rangle=\{\phi,-\phi,\frac{1}{\phi^{2}}\}$ . With the help of Wolfram Alpha, I was able to calculate $r(\phi)\approx1.93649$ (Circumcenter: https://tinyurl.com/y59trfn5 | Radius: https://tinyurl.com/y6jxs9sn ) Calculating the circumcenter seems to be the biggest issue, but maybe there's a cleaner way with the help of linear algebra? I was reading that there's a way to calculate the formula of a circle using matrices and determinants, but that seemed too complex for this. Maybe circles and triangles aren't the way to approach this at all -- I'd be happy to take suggestions and hear your thoughts! Just some last conceptual thoughts... 1) $r(x)$ should always be positive (i.e. there is no $x$ where $r(x)$ is $0$ or negative), and therefore somewhere hit some positive minimum value for $r(x)$ (assuming/implying that $r(x)$ is smooth and differentiable on the interval $x \in (-\infty,1)\cup(1,+\infty)$ ). 2) $\lim\limits_{x \to 1^-}r(x)=+\infty$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to 1^+}r(x)=+\infty$ 3) $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}r(x)=+\infty$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty}r(x)=+\infty$ 4) $r(x)$ is NOT symmetric around $x=1$ . Just as a quick check, $r(3)\approx2.12459$ and $r(-1)\approx1.76777$ 5) $r(x)$ is actual VERY NOISY as a function since for any 1 value of $r(x)$ , there are at least 3 unique variables that result in that value (i.e. all $x \in \langle x\rangle$ )(e.g. $r(2)=r(-1)=r(\frac{1}{2})\approx1.76777$ ) That last point makes me feel there's no true closed-form function for $r(x)$ . Regardless, I'd be really curious to find out what the minimum radius is...

Using the characteristic function, we can write $$P_{ X_1 + \dotsb +X_M }(u)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\!\!\left[ \left( \frac{i(1-e^{it}) }t \right)^M \right]\!\!(u)$$ ( Elaboration on how to obtain this last result is welcome. ) After calculation, $$P_{ X_1 + \dotsb +X_M }(u) = \frac{1}{2(n-1)!}\sum^{M}_{k=0}(-1)^{k}\binom{n}{k}(u-k)^{M-1} \mathrm{sgn}(u-k)  \tag{*}$$ I propose to proceed by induction. $$M=2: \qquad P_{X_{1}+X_{2}}(x)=\begin{cases}
               x & \text{if } \: \: \: 0 \leq x \leq 1\\

Obviously, for the case where $n$ is even, it does not matter, but for the case of $n$ odd, it does change the count, because odd $n$ may have coprimes that are odd as well. In this function (2) we do not count them. $(3)$ In that modification, we count numbers smaller than $n$ which are coprime to it, up to a certain bound $B$ . For example, $\varphi(3,7) = 3$ . Although all numbers smaller than $7$ are coprime to it, we only count those $\leqslant B = 3$ . Finally, I am interested in a sum which involves both modifications. For a limit $L$ , consider the following sum: $$(4) \qquad \qquad S = \sum_{n=1}^{\sqrt {L-1}}\widehat \varphi(\sqrt {L-n^2},n)$$ To express it in a more clear way, further denote $B_n = \sqrt {L-n^2}$ , so we can rewrite the sum as follows: $$(5) \qquad \qquad S = \sum_{n=1}^{\sqrt {L-1}}\widehat \varphi(B_n,n)$$ Calculating totients $(1)$ is well known and I won't go into details about it. I am also aware of efficient ways to evaluate the totient summatory function $\sum_{k=1}^n \varphi (k)$ . However, efficiently calculating $(2)$ and $(3)$ is something I do not know how to do.

I am trying to understand that, in Riemannian space, gradient satisfies the property $g(\nabla f, v) = df(v)$ . Here, $f$ is a scalar-valued function, $v$ is a vector in the tangent space at point $P$ on the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the directional derivative along $v$ is $df(v)$ . Essentially, this property links the gradient to the directional derivative. In Orthonormal Euclidean Space $\{x,y,z\}$ , the gradient is $\nabla f  = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y},\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right)$ .

3218771,Characterization of Reflexive Banach Space.,"Prove that a real Banach Space $X$ is reflexive if and only if each pair of disjoint closed, convex subsets of $X$ , one of which is bounded, can be strictly separated by a hyperplane. The theorem is stated and proved in the book Geometric Functional Analysis and its Applications by Richard Holmes on page-161, which goes like this We shall show that the disjoint closed convex sets $H$ and $U(M)$ cannot be strictly separated. Suppose otherwise; then there would exist $\psi\in X^*$ and a positive number $\gamma$ such that $\psi(x)<\gamma<\psi(y)$ for all $x\in U(M)$ and $y\in H$ . Let us assume that $\phi$ has been extended to all of $X$ via the Hahn-Banach Theorem, and let us call the extension $\phi$ also. Choose any point $\overline{x}\in X$ such that $\phi(\overline{x})=\|\phi\|$ and any $z\in X$ for which $\phi(z)=0$ . Then for all $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}, \psi(\overline{x}+\lambda z)>\gamma$ . Hence, $\psi(z)=0$ and so $\ker(\phi)\subset \ker(\psi)$ . This means that the set $\{\phi,\psi\}$ is linearly dependent. We can therefore choose a constant $\alpha$ so that $\psi=\left(\frac{\alpha \gamma}{\|\phi\|}\right) \phi$ . Now if $y\in H$ then $\gamma<\psi(y)=\alpha \gamma$ , so that $1<\alpha$ . On the other hand, if $x\in U(M)$ then $\psi(x)<\gamma$ , and so $\phi(x)=\left(\frac{\|\phi\|}{\alpha\gamma}\right)\psi(x)<\frac{\|\phi\|}{\alpha}$ ; since $\alpha>1$ , this contradicts the definition $\|\phi\|=\sup\{\phi(x):x\in U(M)\}$ . 
  I am trying to decipher this proof. It uses the contrapositive logic and is based on the James Theorem a Banach space $X$ is reflexive if and only if every continuous linear functional on $X$ attains its supremum on the closed unit ball in $X$ . And, here is what I could understand in this proof Let $X$ be a Banach Space and $M$ be a subspace. Let $\phi\in M^*$ be a continuous linear functional.  Let $H=\{x\in M:\phi(x)=\|\phi\|\}$ be a hyperplane in $M$ and $U(M)=\{x\in M:\|x\|=1\}$ be a unit ball in $M$ . Suppose that there exists a continuous linear functional $\psi\in X^*$ and a positive number $\gamma$ such that $\psi(x)<\gamma<\psi(y)$ for all $x\in U(M)$ and $y\in H.$ Choose a point $\overline{x}\in X$ such that $\phi(\overline{x})=\|\phi\|$ , i.e. $\overline{x}\in H$ and any $z\in X$ such that $\phi(z)=0$ . 
  Then, for a real number $\lambda$ , $\phi(\overline{x}+\lambda z)=\phi(\overline{x})+\lambda \phi(z)$ .
  Since $\overline{x}\in H$ and $\phi(z)=0$ , $\phi(\overline{x}+\lambda z)=\|\phi\|+\lambda. 0$ . $\implies \phi(\overline{x}+\lambda z)=\|\phi\|$ . $\implies \overline{x}+\lambda z\in H$ . $\implies \psi(\overline{x}+\lambda z)>\gamma$ .

error per purchase in a random sample of 150 purchases is normal) a) I think the answer should be $\frac{10}{150} \approx \$0.07$ per purchase. b) I do not know how to solve this problem. Here is what I have done so far: Let $X$ be the random variable for the error in total. Since the number in cents is selected in the discrete interval $[0,99]$ randomly, the probability for rounding any price amount is $p = 0.5$ because for the first 50 digits [0 , 49], we don't round, but we round for [50 , 99].

Z {}={}& X + Y
\\
\Sigma_Z {}={}& \Sigma_X + \Sigma_Y + 2 \cov(X, Y)
\end{align} Intuitively, I would assume the cross-covariance can be computed as follows: $$\cov(X, Y) = P_{XY} \sqrt{\Sigma_X} \sqrt{\Sigma_Y}$$ But I can see that this matrix is not necessarily symmetric, and therefore the resulting $\Sigma_Z$ wouldn't be either. Am I wrong? Is it at all possible to compute $\Sigma_Z$ from the information I have? If not, is there some way to approximate it? EDIT: I think it isn't correct to write: $$ \Sigma_Z = \Sigma_X + \Sigma_Y + 2 \cov(X, Y) $$ as $\cov(X,Y) \ne \cov(Y,X)$ , but instead $\cov(X,Y) = \cov(Y,X)^T$ .

How to prove that $\pi \colon \tilde{X} \to X$ is finite? Is it even correct in general? I'm thinking of something like the blow up of $V(y^2 - x^2 - x^3)$ . If I 
consider $V(y^2 - x^2 - x^3, xs-yt)$ in $\mathbb{A}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ and go to the chart $t=1$ I get the equation $s^2 - 1 - x$ where I easily see, that $s$ in integral over $k[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2 - x^3)$ . On the chart $s=1$ , I can't see it that easily or if I go to a chart where one of the points in the fiber over $0$ is missing I don't get a finite morphism. My idea was to use relationship affine + proper = finite for morphism of schemes like here https://lovelylittlelemmas.rjprojects.net/proper-affine-finite/ . But Im not very familiar with (non)-affine schemes. So it is known that a blowing up is proper. And the closed immersion of the strict transform in the blow up is proper too? Because I can find a chart with all points of the fiber over $0$ , $\pi$ must be affine too? and is then finite. My questions are now: 1) Is this argumentation correct? 2) I actually only need the fact $\mathrm{Spec}(A[x]) \to \mathrm{Spec}(B[x])$ is closed, where $A$ and $B$ are the coordinate rings of (affine) $\tilde{X}$ resp. $X$ ,  which follows from $\tilde{X} \to X$ universally closed. Is there a more elementary way to see this. 3) How can I easily prove that $\pi$ is quasi-finite, i.e. the fiber over $0$ finite? Can I see more easily, that $\pi$ is affine? 4) The whole argumentation shouldn't be true for blow ups at ideals with dimension > 0, otherwise I could finitely desingularize every variety. Would this be because $\pi$ is no longer affine? 5) What if the affine curve is not irreducible, i.e. $X$ not integral. There wouldn't be any problem with properness?

3219888,Different methods of solving a linear system of first order DE?,"$$ x'(t)=\begin{pmatrix} 1&\frac{-2}3\\3&4\end{pmatrix}x(t).$$ This is the method described in my book: finding the eigenvalues of matrix $A  = \begin{pmatrix} 1&\frac{-2}3\\3&4\end{pmatrix}$ : $$ \begin{vmatrix} 1-\lambda&\frac{-2}3 \\3&4-\lambda\end{vmatrix}=0\iff \lambda=3, \lambda=2.$$ eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda=3$ : $\begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ , eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda=2$ : $\begin{pmatrix} -2/3 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ . define $C = \begin{pmatrix} -2/3 & -1/3 \\ 1&1\end{pmatrix}$ , then $C^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 & 3 \\ -1&2\end{pmatrix}$ , and $$ A = C\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)C^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} -2/3 & -1/3 \\ 1&1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2&0\\0&3\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 3 \\ -1&2\end{pmatrix}.$$ calculate $e^{tA} $ . Using previous expression for $A$ we get $$ e^{tA}=\begin{pmatrix} -2/3 & -1/3 \\ 1&1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} e^{2t}&0\\0&e^{3t}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 3 \\ -1&2\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2e^{2t}+\frac13e^{3t} & -2e^{2t}-\frac23e^{3t} \\ -3e^{2t}-e^{3t} & 3e^{2t}+2e^{3t}\end{pmatrix}.$$ the solution of the given system, considering the initial condition $x_0=(x_1,x_2)^t$ , equals to $e^{tA}x_0$ : $$ e^{tA}x_0 = \dots = x_1\begin{pmatrix}2e^{2t}+\frac13e^{3t} \\-3e^{2t}-e^{3t} \end{pmatrix}+x_2\begin{pmatrix} -2e^{2t}-\frac23e^{3t} \\3e^{2t}+2e^{3t}\end{pmatrix}$$ Now, I have looked up some extra exercises online, but these seem to solve such systems in a shorter way: the solution of the system above with be given by $c_1e^{2t}\begin{pmatrix} -2/3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + c_2e^{3t}\begin{pmatrix} -1/3 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ . What is the difference between both approaches? The method used by my book seems to have more coefficients (and is therefore maybe a little more detailed/exact?). Are these solution methods equivalent? Which one would you use? Thanks.","['systems-of-equations', 'proof-verification', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
