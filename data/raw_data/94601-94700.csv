And again it was mostly due to simple mistakes such as forgetting about minus in front of fraction, switching y coordinates of two points etc. The assignments are pretty simple, for example calculating area defined by N curves or analyzing a function.

Let $K$ be the set of all elements of $E$ that are purely inseparable over $F$ . Then, $E/K/F$ is a tower of fields, and $K/F$ is purely inseparable. In this case, is $E/K$ always separable? If not, what is a counterexample? Moreover, let $K^s$ and $F^s$ be the separable closures in $E$ . Then, $E/K^s$ is purely inseparable. How different are $K^s$ and $F^s$ as fields? That is, how much nicer is the extension $K^s/K$ compared to $F^s/F$ ? Question 2 Let $E/F$ be a normal field extension. Let $E^G$ denote the fixed field of $\operatorname{Aut}(E/F)$ . Then, $E/E^G$ is separable and $E^G/F$ is purely inseperable. Is $E^G$ the unique such subextension?

1295628,Probability when cutting the stick twice,"Given a stick of length $l$. We cut the stick twice. Let $X$ be the random variable defined by the length of the stick after the first cut, and $Y$ be the random variable defined by the length of the stick after the second cut. What is the probability for $Y>\frac{l}{4}$? First, the PDF of $X$ is uniform, thus $f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{l}$ (since $0\le X\le l$). $Y$ is uniform in $[0,X]$, then $f_{Y|X}(y|x)=\frac{1}{x}$. Then the probability of $Y>\frac{l}{4}$ is $$\int_{l/4}^{x}\frac{1}{x}dy=1-\frac{l}{4x}$$ On the other hand, we have $$f_{X,Y}=f_Xf_{Y|X}=\frac{1}{lx}$$ 
We write the probability of $Y>\frac{l}{4}$ as follow: $$P\left(\frac{l}{4}<Y<x|\frac{l}{4}\le X \le l\right)=\frac{P(l/4<Y<x,l/4\le X \le l)}{P(l/4\le X\le l)}=\frac{\int_{l/4}^{x}\int_{l/4}^{l} \frac{1}{lx}dxdy}{\frac{1}{l}}$$ which leads to a different result from $1-\frac{l}{4x}$.

1295701,Understanding a step in Yi Fang's Lectures on Minimal Surfaces,"In Yi Fang's Lectures on Minimal Surfaces, page $94$, there's a step that I didn't understand, and that perhaps is wrong. I'll estabilish some notation first. We have that $X$ is a minimal surface, $X(t)$ is a variation (understand here that $X(0) = X$), $g_{ij}(t)$ is the first fundamental form, $g^{ij}(t)$ is its inverse, and $h_{ij}(t)$ is the second fundamental form. We have the variational field $$E(t) = \frac{\partial X(t)}{\partial t},$$ and $E(0) \equiv E = \alpha X_1 + \beta X_2 + \gamma N$. We also assume isothermal coordinates $g_{ij} = \Lambda^2 \delta_{ij}$. This implies that $g^{ij} = \Lambda^{-2}\delta_{ij}$. He states that: $$\frac{{\rm d}g^{ij}(t)}{{\rm d}t}\Bigg|_{t=0} = -\Lambda^{-4}(E_i \cdot X_j + E_j \cdot X_i),$$ ok. Then he says: Using $h_{11} = -h_{22}$ and $X_{11}\cdot X_1 = \frac{1}{2}\Lambda_1^2$, $X_{11}\cdot X_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\Lambda_2^2$, etc, we have: $$\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{{\rm d}g^{ij}(t)}{{\rm d}t}\Bigg|_{t=0}h_{ij} = \gamma \Lambda^{-4}\sum_{i,j}h_{ij}^2 - \Lambda^{-2}(\alpha_1h_{11}+(\alpha_2+\beta_1)h_{12}+\beta_2h_{22})$$ I just don't follow that. We could say that: $$X_1 \cdot X_1 = \Lambda^2 \implies 2 X_{11}\cdot X_1 = 2\Lambda_1\Lambda \implies X_{11}\cdot X_1 = \Lambda_1\Lambda,$$ and I don't see how he got that expression.

1295751,Proof of an identity of $n!$,"I came up (numerically) with an identity concerning n! and I was wondering about a proof of it. Here it is: \begin{align}
  \ n! &= \sum_{r=0}^{n} { \binom{n}{r} (-1)^r(k-r)^n  } \quad \forall n \in  \mathbb{Z}^+ \quad \forall k \in \mathbb{R} \\\\

(one line edit) I apologise for first accidentally writing $(-n)^n$ instead of $(-r)^n$, as I should have. For simplicity, k can be set to 0 to yield: \begin{align}
  \ n! &= \sum_{r=0}^{n} { \binom{n}{r} (-1)^r(-r)^n  } \\\\
\end{align} I derived this equation based on that it seems to be the case that nth difference of a polynomial in the form \begin{align} y &= x^n \end{align} always ends up being n!. The origin of k is that it is the initial position from which I started taking the difference, but I left in as I thought it interesting that it cancels out completely. I know Calculus suggests it, but is there a way to prove it without calculus (my goal was to do it while keeping the difference in x constant, ie (x+d)^n - x^n, where d stays 1 preferrably)? So far my attempts yield nested sums. I am not anything close to a mathematician, so I apologise if this is extremely trivial.

Assume that the unit ball $B_X$ is separable in this topology. Is it then true that the $X$ is separable in this topology? I think that this is true. Let $D\subset B_X$ be dense. Then $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} n D $ is dense in $X$, right? My attempt for the proof: Given $x\in X$, then $\frac{1}{N} x \in B_X$ for some $N$ large enough. Now there exists a sequence $(y_n)_n \subset D$ such that $y_n \to \frac{1}{N}x$ as $n\to\infty$. Hence $N y_n \to x$ and clearly $Ny_n \in N D$.

The ratio of geese to hens is 1:3. 
60% of the birds are ducks. How many geese does Mrs. Smith have? a) 16
b) 8

d) 11 I know that if 60% if the birds are ducks, 40% are geese and hens. Now I have to find 40% of 80 so in order to do this I change 40% into a decimal, which is 0.4, and then multiply this by 80. The result of this is 32 which means there are 32 birds not including the ducks. I am sure I got this part of the question correct but after this I am not sure what to do. I started off by creating a chart because for every one geese there are three hens, so for every two geese there are six hens (multiples of three) and so on. Since this does not go evenly into 32, I know I am probably doing something wrong. I was told the answer is 8 but I do not understand why.

Prove that then $f(z)$ can be analytically continued to the whole plane and that the resulting entire function satisfies $F(z+4)=F(z)$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$.

Principle but I don't quite see how the $F(z+4)=F(z)$ comes out. I assume it will have to do since it can be infinitely reflected left and right throughout the plane, With my understanding of the Schwarz reflection principle, I believe $f$ would extend to $\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,:\,-1<\text{Re }z<3\}$ with $\overline{F(\overline{1-z}+1)}=F(z)$ (since $z\mapsto \overline{1-z}+1$ is the reflection about the line $\text{Re }z=1$ and $z\mapsto\overline{z}$ is the usual reflection about the real axis) TL;DR I understand how it can be analytically continued to an entire function, just not that the resulting entire function satisfies $F(z+4)=F(z)$.

1295901,"In $\mathbb Q_p$, proving every open ball is the disjoint union of more than one open ball","I'm reading the Foundations chapter of Gouvea's p-adic Numbers: An Introduction , and I'm trying to solve the following problem he poses to the reader: Take the $p-$adic absolute value on $\mathbb Q$. Show that with respect to this absolute value, every open ball is the disjoint union of [more than one open ball]. In the hints, he suggests that the reader use ""scaling and translating"" of results from earlier problems about $\mathbb Q_p$: First, the problem of showing that the closed ball $\overline B(0,1)$ is the disjoint union of open balls
$$
\overline B(0,1) = B(0,1)\cup B(1,1)\cup B(2,1)\cup \cdots\cup B(p-1,1),
$$
and second, the problem of showing that the open ball of radius $1$ about $0$ is equivalent to the closed ball of radius $1/p$ about $0$. The first problem can be solved by supposing $x\in \overline B(0,1)$, noting that in lowest terms $x = a/b$ with $p\nmid b$, and then showing that the terms
$$
a, a-b, a-2b, \ldots, a-(p-1)b
$$
are all unequal modulo $p$. The second problem can be solved simply by noting that the $p-$adic absolute value can only take values of the form $p^n$, $n\in\mathbb Z$, and thus there are no elements of $\mathbb Q_p$ with absolute values strictly between $1/p$ and $1$. What I'm having trouble doing is ""scaling and translating"" the above two solutions to the general cases required to solve the present problem. My work so far for each part is as follows: For the first part: Let $x\in \overline B(x_0, \varepsilon)$. Then $|x-x_0| \leq \varepsilon$. Write $x-x_0$ in lowest terms as $a/b$ and suppose that the $p-$adic valuation $v_p(a/b)\geq 0$, so that $p\nmid b$. Now consider the $p$ terms
$$
a, a-b, a-2b, \ldots, a-(p-1)b.
$$
If any pair of these were congruent modulo $p$, then we would have their difference being divisible by $p$, so $p|(kb)$ where $0 < k < p$, and then $p|b$, a contradiction. Thus, $p$ divides precisely one of these terms, $a - jb$. Then $v_p(\frac{a-jb}{b}) > 0$, so $|\frac{a-jb}{b}| < 1$, that is, $|\frac{a}{b} - j| < 1$, so $x-x_0 = a/b \in B(j,1)$. However, I think I'm supposed to end up with $x$ being in some sort of open ball, rather than $x-x_0$ being in the open ball, so I'm stuck. I am intending to look at the case of $v_p(a/b) < 0$ separately, once I get past this point. For the second part, I know that given $B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, if I let $n$ be the largest integer strictly less than $\log_p \varepsilon$, then $\overline B(x_0, p^n) = B(x_0,\varepsilon)$, and then since every closed ball is the disjoint union of open balls from the preceding part, I am done.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'general-topology']"

When $E$ has a metric and $\nabla$ is compatible with this metric, then the metric compatibility definition implies that parallel transport defines an isometry (abusing notation a bit, metric compatibility gives $d/dt\langle s_1,s_2 \rangle=\langle \nabla_{t}s_1,s_2\rangle + \langle s_1,  \nabla_{t}s_2\rangle = 0$ along $\gamma$ for parallel sections).

1296049,About negligible terms in a limit,"When is it valid to deal with a term as a ""negligible"" one in a limit? I am asking this question because I usually do not take limits very seriously, and I can do a lot of ""illegal"" moves just to evaluate and get back to the important thing. This is a very broad question, that is why I'll just give two examples and ask about them instead. Example $1$: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{e^n + n^{2015} + 1}{e^\sqrt{n^2 + \sin(n) + \ln(n)}}$$ I would usually say: the numerator is asymptotic to $e^n$, and the denominator is as well, because $n^2 + \sin(n) + \ln(n)$ is asymptotic to $n^2$. The limit eventually becomes $1$. Had I done an invalid move? Example $2.1$: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{n} \times |x|^{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} |x|^{n}$$ Example $2.2$: $$\lim_{n \to 0} \frac{n + 1}{n + 2} \times \frac{\ln(n)}{e^n} = \frac12 \lim_{n \to 0} \frac{\ln(n)}{e^n}$$ Was my writing in $2.1$ and $2.2$ valid?

1296382,Questions about a topological proof of the FTA,"I'm a high school student, curious about proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Specifically, I've been thinking about one of the topological proofs of the theorem, given in Courant's book, ""What is Mathematics"". Here are my questions: But the order $Ï(t)$ depends continuously on $t$, since $f(z)$ is a continuous function of $z$. Hence we shall have a contradiction, for the function $Ï(t)$ can assume only integral values and therefore cannot pass continuously from the value $0$ to the value $n$. I don't get this part. What is it trying to say? I know that $f(z)$ is a continuous function, and that $Ï(t)$ changes 'smoothly' with $t$ (in my mind I have a picture of a closed curve shrinking 'smoothly' when the circle that $z$ traces also shrinks in the same way, hence, at every value of $t$, there exists a unique order. However, I also know that the order must have integral values, because there can't be $3.14$ turns.) But is this correct? I think I'm getting these concepts in a muddle. I also can't see how this contradiction serves to show that our initial assumption about $f(z)$ not having a root is absurd. Since the expression on the left is the distance between the two points $z^n$ and $f(z)$, while the last expression on the right is the distance of the point $z^n$ from the origin, we see that the straight line segment joining the two points $f(z)$ and $z^n$ cannot pass through the origin so long as z is on the circle of radius $t$ about the origin. What does this really imply? In my mind I think that whenever z traces out a circle with a radius $t$ $\neq$ $0$, the rest of the terms in $f(z)$ will never be $0$. But how does this help with proving that when t is large,  $f(z)$ behaves like $z^n$? This being so, we may continuously deform the curve traced out by $f(z)$ into the curve traced out by $z^n$ without ever passing through the origin, simply by pushing each point $f(z)$ along the segment joining it to $z^n$. Since the order of the origin will vary continuously and can assume only integral values during this deformation, it must be the same for both curves. Since the order for $z^n$ is $n$, the order for $f(z)$ must also be $n$. What does ""deforming $f(z)$ into $z^n$ mean, and why do we want to do this? How can the order vary continuously if it can only assume integral values? How does this show that the orders of $z^n$ and $f(z)$ are the same?

1296634,"Prob. 5, Sec. 27 in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed: Every compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space","Here is Prob. 5, Sec. 27, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space; let $\left\{  A_n  \right\}$ be a countable collection of closed sets of $X$ . If each set $A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ , then the union $\bigcup  A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ . How to show this fact? What if we have an uncountable collection of closed sets, each set having empty interior? Does the conclusion still hold? My effort: First a preliminary result: Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, and let $A$ be a closed subset of $X$ . If $U$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ such that $U \not\subset A$ , then there is a non-empty open set $V$ in $X$ such that $\overline{V} \subset U-A$ , that is, $\overline{V} \subset U$ and $\overline{V} \cap A = \emptyset$ . Am I right? Proof: Since $U \not\subset A$ , the set $U - A$ is non-empty. Let $x \in U-A$ . Let us put $$ B \colon= A \cup (X-U). \tag{Definition 0} $$ Then $B$ is closed in $X$ , and also $x \not\in B$ . Now since $X$ is compact and since $B$ is closed in $X$ , therefore $B$ is also compact (as a subspace of $X$ ), by virtue of Theorem 26.2 in Munkres. Since $X$ is a Hausdorff space, since $x \in X$ , and since $B$ is a compact subspace of $X$ such that $x \not\in B$ , therefore by Lemma 26.4 in Munkres there are open sets $V$ and $W$ in $X$ such that $$ x \in V, \qquad B \subset W, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad V \cap W = \emptyset. \tag{1} $$ Therefore we have $$
\begin{align}
X- W &\subset X-B \qquad \mbox{ [because $B \subset W \subset X$] } \\
&= X - \big( A \cup (X-U) \big) \qquad \mbox{ [by (Definition 0) above ] } \\
&= (X-A)\cap \big( X-(X-U) \big) \qquad \mbox{ [a DeMorgan's law] } \\
&= (X-A) \cap U \\ 
& \qquad \mbox{ [the compelement of the complement set $U\subset X$ equals $U$ itself] }\\
&= U-A \qquad \mbox{ [a set-theoretic identity] },
\end{align}
$$ that is, $$ X-W \subset U-A; \tag{2} $$ and also from (1) we have $$ V \subset X-W.  $$ Moreover, since $X-W$ is closed in $X$ and since $V \subset X - W$ , therefore we can also conclude that $$ \overline{V} \subset X-W. \tag{3} $$ Thus from (1), (2), and (3) above we obtain $$ x \in V \subset \overline{V} \subset X-W \subset U-A. $$ That is, $V$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ and $\overline{V} \subset U-A$ , 
  as required. Is this proof correct? Now for the main proof: Let us put $$ A \colon= \bigcup A_n . \tag{A} $$ We show that $A$ has empty interior. For this, we show that there is no non-empty open set $U$ in $X$ such that $U \subset A$ . Let $U$ be any non-empty open set in $X$ . Let us put $$V_0 \colon= U. \tag{0} $$ This is just for notational convenience. Then since $A_1$ has empty interior in $X$ and since $V_0$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , therefore the set $V_0$ is not contained in $A_1$ . So there exists a non-empty open set $V_1$ in $X$ such that $$\overline{V_1} \subset V_0 -A_1. \tag{1} $$ Again as the set $A_2$ has empty interior in $X$ and as $V_1$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , so the set $V_1 \not\subset A_2$ , and thus there exists a non-empty open set $V_2$ in $X$ such that $$ \overline{V_2} \subset V_1 - A_2. \tag{2} $$ Now suppose that the non-empty open sets $V_1, \ldots,  V_{n-1}$ (for $ n= 3, 4, 5, \ldots$ ) have been chosen such that $$ \overline{V_k} \subset V_{k-1} - A_k \ \mbox{ for each } \ k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1. \tag{3} $$ Now as the set $A_n$ has empty interior in $X$ and as the set $V_{n-1}$ is a non-empty open set in $X$ , so $V_{n-1} \not\subset A_n$ , which implies that there exists a non-empty open set $V_n$ in $X$ such that $$ \overline{V_n} \subset V_{n-1} - A_n. \tag{4} $$ From (1) we note that $$ \overline{V_1} \subset V_0 \subset \overline{V_0} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_1} \cap A_1 = \emptyset. $$ From (2) we find that $$ \overline{V_2} \subset V_1 \subset \overline{V_1} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_2} \cap A_2 = \emptyset. $$ And so on, from (4) we find that $$ \overline{V_n} \subset V_{n-1} \subset \overline{V_{n-1}} \qquad \mbox{ and also } \qquad \overline{V_n} \cap A_n = \emptyset $$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > 1$ . Thus we have a sequence $$ \overline{V_0}, \overline{V_1}, \overline{V_2}, \overline{V_3}, \ldots $$ of non-empty closed sets in $X$ such that, for each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ , we have $$ \overline{V_n} \subset \overline{V_{n-1}} \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad \overline{V_n} \cap A_n = \emptyset. \tag{5} $$ In particular, $\overline{V_1} \subset U$ , by virtue of (1) and (0) above. And, if $\overline{V_{n_1}}, \ldots, \overline{V_{n_k}}$ are any finitely many of these sets, then we have $$ \bigcap_{i=1}^k \overline{V_{n_i}} = \overline{V_{n_0}} ,$$ where $$ n_0 \colon= \max\left\{ n_1, \ldots, n_k \right\}, $$ and so $\bigcap_{i=1}^k \overline{V_{n_i}}$ is non-empty. Thus the nested sequence $\left( \overline{V_n} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of non-empty closed sets of $X$ has the finite intersection property, and as $X$ is compact, so by Theorem 26.9 in Munkres these sets have a non-empty intersection. That is, $$ \bigcap  \overline{V_n} \neq \emptyset. $$ Suppose $x \in \bigcap \overline{V_n}$ . Then $x$ is in each set $\overline{V_n}$ , which implies that $x \in U$ and also that $x$ is not in any set $A_n$ , and so $x \not\in A$ , refer to Def. (A) above. Thus $x \in U - A$ and therefore $U \not\subset A$ . But $U$ was any arbitrarily chosen non-empty open set in $X$ . Hence $A = \bigcup A_n$ has empty interior. Is my proof correct? If so, is it clear enough in each and every detail? If not, then where is it in need of improvement / correction?","['solution-verification', 'baire-category', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"

1296698,A really basic integration question concerning differentials,"I'm really, really confused with this. Please, please help me.
$$$$
My Calculus teacher taught me that the integral symbol and the differential with respect to which we are integrating are like parenthesis. He told us to think of the integral sign as an âopen parenthesisâ and the $dt$ as a âclose parenthesisâ. If we were to integrate any function of $t$, say $v(t)$, we have to put the integral sign on the left of $v(t)$, and the differential $dt$ on the right of $v(t)$ ie $\int v(t) dt$ $$$$
In physics, while while deriving equations of motion, our physics teacher did this: since v is a linear function of t, $$dv(t)/dt=a(constant)$$ $$\Rightarrow dv= a dt$$
She then simply put an integral sign on LHS and RHS to integrate and then got $$\int dv= \int a dt$$
$$v=at+C$$
But this does not fit into what my Calculus teacher had taught us. As per what he has taught: 
$$ dv= a dt$$
We now have to add an integral sign and another differential on either side of the expressions in LHS and RHS respectively. Only then can we integrate.$$$$
Could somebody please explain this idea of the integral sign as an âopen parenthesisâ and the $dt$ as a âclose parenthesisâ? Please could you explain how this is applied to the physics example?","['derivatives', 'calculus', 'indefinite-integrals', 'integration']"

However, it was also demonstrated that for fields, you cannot keep the multiplicative inverse under a product structure, i.e. if I have fields $F_{1}, F_{2}$, then $F_{1} \times F_{2}$ will still be a ring, but you will not (not just ""not in general"", but won't) have multiplicative inverses for all non-zero (i.e. not $(0, 0)$) elements, as you could pick $(0, x)$, where $x \neq 0$. According to Wikipedia, an ultraproduct will preserve field structure, but I'm not sure what the cardinality of $\prod_{i \in I} F_{i} / \mathscr{U}$ would be in general. I saw another post that said you could make a field of arbitrarily large cardinality by extending a given field through throwing in a whole bunch of ""transcendental"" elements. The example given was that if I had $\mathbb{Q}$, I could start by dumping in the complexes, but then I suppose after that I'd just start throwing in dogs and cats or something; I'm really not sure what that responder meant, and ceteris paribus, my dogs tend to stay inside, so I'd rather keep them out of my fields, particularly the large ones the thread was interested in. Moreover, the thread mentioned earlier seemed more concerned with just making the fields big. My question is a bit more nuanced: Given any cardinality $\kappa > 1$, can I generally construct a field $F$ of a cardinality $\kappa$? Moreover, how vague do I have to be about it (i.e. do I have to use some really choicy methods, or can I make it a bit more straightforward)? Thanks. EDIT: Sorry. I am aware that for finite fields, you are limited to powers of primes. I meant for infinite cardinals.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
1296896,"With the aid of series, show that if $f(z)=\frac{\operatorname{cos}z}{z^2-(\pi/2)^2}$, then $f$ is an entire function.","Prove that if $$f(z)=

\frac{\operatorname{cos}z}{z^2-(\pi/2)^2}, & \text{when} \; z\neq \pm \pi/2, \\
-\frac{1}{\pi}, & \text{when} \; z=\pm \pi/2,
\end{cases}
$$ then $f$ is an entire function. The general method of proving such results from the book is by using the fact that if a function has a power series representation, then it is analytic in the circle of convergence. Hence, using this method, I first need to find the power series of $f$ when $z\neq \pm \pi/2$, and the proof is complete if I show that this series at $z=\pm \pi/2$, equals $-\frac{1}{\pi}$. So I start with the Taylor series of the entire function $\operatorname{cos}z$, however, I'm having trouble dealing with the denominator $z^2-(\pi/2)^2$. How can I find the power series representation of this function? I would greatly appreciate some help.","['power-series', 'analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'complex-analysis']"

1296951,Confusion about the sample mean and random variables,"As I understand the sample mean you just add a bunch of random variables that constitute a sample from their common distribution and divide by the number of those same random variables. When I apply it in actual problems I get specific numbers from the population and take their mean. This confuses me as I thought that when you add random variables it represents adding all the possible outcomes of those random variables. So my understanding of adding random variables is that if you had random variables $X$ and $Y$, that could take on the values $1$ and $2$, $X + Y$ represents $1+1$, $1+2$, $2+1$, $2+2$. Thus I feel that the definition of a sample mean clashes with it's application where you just take specific values from the population and add them up. I hope that makes sense.","['statistics', 'random-variables']"
1297035,What mistake have I made when trying to evaluate the limit $\lim \limits _ {n \to \infty}n - \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b}$?,"Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. $$\lim \limits _ {n \to \infty}n - \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b} = ?$$ What I did first: I rearranged $\sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b} = n \sqrt{1+ \frac{a}{n}} \sqrt{1+ \frac{b}{n}}$ and so: $$\lim \limits _ {n \to \infty} n - n \sqrt{1+ \frac{a}{n}} \sqrt{1+ \frac{b}{n}} = 0$$
Because both $\frac{a}{n}$ and $\frac{b}{n}$ tend to $0$. What would give a correct answer: Plotting the function $$f(x) = x - \sqrt{x+a} \sqrt{x+b}$$
Clearly indicates that it has an asymptote in $- \frac{a+b}{2}$. This result can be obtained multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $n + \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b}$:
$$\lim \limits _ {n \to \infty}n - \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b} = $$
$$-\lim \limits _{n \to \infty} \frac {n(a+b)}{n + \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b}} - \lim \limits _{n \to \infty} \frac {ab}{n + \sqrt{n+a} \sqrt{n+b}}$$

$$\text{Prob}\{X_1-X_2 \geq 0\} $$
where $X_1 \sim$ Poisson $(\mu_1)$ is independent from $X_2 \sim$ Poisson $(\mu_2)$.
I need to understand the behavior of: 
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu_1}\text{Prob}\{X_1-X_2 \geq 0\} $$ My intuition is that the CDF is increasing in $\mu_1$. However, my intuition proved to be wrong in many occasions : ) The Poisson difference distribution (Skellam distribution) has not a convenient closed form distribution, in particular, its PMF includes a BesselI function and it is not straightforward to take the derivative. Therefore, exploiting the fact that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent ""we can write"" (this is my claim): $$ 
\text{Prob}\{X_1-X_2 \geq 0\} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\text{Prob}\{X_1=k\}\text{Prob}\{X_2\leq k\} 
$$ $$=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\text{Prob}\{X_1=k\} \sum_{h=0}^k\text{Prob}\{X_2=h\}  $$ For a generic $k$ $$e^{-\mu_1}\frac{\mu_1^k}{k!} e^{-\mu_2}\sum_{h=0}^k \frac{\mu_2^h}{h!} $$ In my particular case I have that $\mu_2 = v-\mu_1$. To be more specific, 
$\mu_1 = vx $ where $v >1$ and $x \in (0,1)$. So I have 
$$\frac{e^{-v}}{k!} \mu_1^k \sum_{h=0}^k \frac{\mu_2^h}{h!} $$ Forgetting the constant term I can show that the expression is increasing in $x$. 
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and studying the sign I get $$vk\mu_1^{k-1}\sum_{h=0}^k \frac{(1-\mu_1^h)}{h!} -v\mu_1^k\sum_{h=0}^k \frac{(1-\mu_1)^h}{h!} >0   $$ If and only if $$\frac{k}{v}>x $$ or $k > \mu_1$ if we just consider the mean.
