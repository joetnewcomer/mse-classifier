493437,Equality and order in sets,"Just started Baby Rudin and got struck in this. While defining order in sets, $<$ was introduced as a relation and for a set to be ordered the condition was: for all $x,y$ belonging to an ordered set $C$, either $x<y$ or $y<x$ or $x=y$. The first two are alright but how do we define the concept of $=$ in any arbitrary set.

$$A =\{(x,y) : -1 < x < 1, -1 < y < 1\}$$

$$\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}$$
Now I'm stuck. What exactly do I have to show? Can I say that this distance is less than $r$? How do I deal with the fact that $r$ can be one of two values? What is the general approach to such problems?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

So first made $$u = 1-x^2$$ and $$y = \int_{0}^{u}e^{(t^2)} dt$$ then used the chain rule $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} * \frac{du}{dx} = e^{u^2} * (-2x)$$
Then subbed u for 1-x^2 in, giving me $$= -2e^{(1-x^2)^2}x$$ But when I plug this in WolframAlpha, I get $$\frac{d}{dx}(\int_{0}^{1-x^2} e^{(t^2)}  dt) = -2 e^{(x^2-1)^2} x$$ In the exponent of e, mine is 1-x^2, but Wolfram gives me x^2-1?","['integration', 'derivatives']"

493538,Can an irrational always be found by multiplying irrationals?,"I was thinking about the function $\ f(a,b) = a/b $ where $a$ and $b$ where both irrational. It quickly stood out to me that the codomain of that function would include every rational number. But, does it include every irrational number as well (in other words, is the codomain of the function $\mathbb{R}$)? Then I thought that if we establish that $a = n \cdot m$  and $b = m$, then if for every irrational number $n$ there exists at least another irrational number $m$ (which could be itself) such that $n \cdot m$ is also irrational, every irrational could be represented by $a/b$ (as $m$ cancels out), and so the function would eventually ""spit out"" all the reals given only irrational input. So my questions are: For every irrational $n$, does there always exist another irrational $m$ such that $n \cdot m$ is also irrational? If this is true as I suspect, what is the simplest proof for it?","['functions', 'irrational-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
493588,Prove that the field F is a vector space over itself.,"How can I prove that a field F is a vector space over itself?
Intuitively, it seems obvious because the definition of a field is
nearly the same as that of a vector space, just with scalers instead
of vectors. Here's what I'm thinking: Let V = { (a) | a in F } describe the vector space for F.  Then I just show
that vector addition is commutative, associative, has an identity and
an inverse, and that scalar multiplication is distributary,
associative, and has an identity. Example 1: Commutativity of addition, Here x,y are in V (x)+(y) = (y)+(x) (x+y)=(y+x): vector addition x + (X+y) = (X + x)+y: associative property Example 2: Additive inverse
x,y,0 in V
(x)+(y)=(0) (x+y)=(0) vector addition Let y=-x in V (X+-x)=(0) substitute (0)=(0) simplify I don't know if I'm going in the right direction with this, although
it seems like it should be a pretty simple proof.  I think mostly I'm
having trouble with the notation. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'field-theory']"
493600,Finding the derivative of $|x|^4$ using the chain rule.,"I am presented with the following task: Can you use the chain rule to find the derivatives of $|x|^4$ and $|x^4|$ in $x = 0$? Do the derivatives exist in $x = 0$? I solved the task in a rather straight-forward way, but I am worried that there's more to the task: First of all, both functions is a variable to the power of an even number, so given that $x$ is a real number, we have that $|x^4| = |x|^4$. In order to force practical use of the chain rule, we write $|x|^4 = \sqrt{x^2}^4$. We are using the fact that taking a number to the power of an even number, and using the absolute value, gives us positive numbers exclusively. If we choose the chain $u = x^2$, thus $g(u) = \sqrt{u}^4$, we have that $u' = 2x$ og $g'(u) = (u^2)' = 2u$. Then we have that the derivative of the function, that I for pratical reasons will name $f(x)$, is $f'(x) = 2x^2 * 2x = 4x^3$. We see that the the general power rule applies here, seeing as we work with a variable to the power of an even number. The derivative in the point $x = 0$ is $4 * 0^3 = \underline{\underline{0}}$. Thus we can conclude that the derivative exists in $x = 0$. Is this fairly logical? I'm having a hard time seeing that there is anything more to this task, but it feels like it went a bit too straightforward.","['absolute-value', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

[duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : If nonempty, nonsingleton $Y$ is a proper convex subset of a simply ordered set $X$, then $Y$ is ray or interval? (1 answer) Closed 10 years ago .

If $Y$ is a proper subset of $X$ that is convex in $X$ , does it follow that $Y$ is an interval or a ray in $X$ ? Well, suppose $Y$ has a smallest element $a$ and a largest element $b$ . Then $[a,b]\in Y$ , and so $Y=[a,b]$ and $Y$ is an interval. What if $Y$ has no smallest element? So for each element $a\in Y$ , there exists an element $b\in Y$ such that $b<a$ .

493756,"Prove that if $\sum{a_n}$ converges absolutely, then $\sum{a_n^2}$ converges absolutely","I'm trying to re-learn my undergrad math, and I'm using Stephen Abbot's Understanding Analysis . In section 2.7, he has the following exercise: Exercise 2.7.5 (a) Show that if $\sum{a_n}$ converges absolutely, then $\sum{a_n^2}$ also converges absolutely. Does this proposition hold without absolute convergence? I'm posting about this here because my answer to that last question about whether the proposition holds without absolute convergence is ""Yes"", but my suspicions are raised by him merely asking the question. Usually questions like this are asked to point out that certain conditions are necessary in the statement of propositions, theorems, etc. I just want to see if I'm missing something here. Anyway, here's how I prove the absolute convergence of $\sum{a_n^2}$, and note that I never use the fact that $\sum{a_n}$ is absolutely convergent: Proof: Let $s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n{a_n^2}$. I want to show that $(s_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. So, let $\epsilon > 0$ and $n > m$, and consider,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    |s_n - s_m| &= |(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots a_n^2) - (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots a_m^2)|\\
                &= |(a_{m+1})^2 + (a_{m+2})^2 + \cdots + a_n^2|\\
                &= |a_{m+1}|^2 + |a_{m+2}|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Now, since $\sum{a_m}$ converges, the sequence $(a_m)$ has limit 0. Therefore I can choose an $N$ such that $|a_m| < \sqrt{\epsilon/n}$ for all $m > N$. So for all $n > m> N$,  we have,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    |s_n - s_m| &= |a_{m+1}|^2 + |a_{m+2}|^2 + \cdots + |a_n|^2\\
                &< \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n}}\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n}}\right)^2\\
                &< \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n-m}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n-m}}\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{n-m}}\right)^2\\
                &= \epsilon
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore $(s_n)$ is Cauchy and $\sum{a_n^2}$ converges. And since $\sum{a_n^2} = \sum{|a_n^2|}$, the series $\sum{a_n^2}$ is absolutely convergent. ∎ Am I doing something wrong here? Am I right in thinking that $\sum{a_n}$ need not be absolutely convergent for $\sum{a_n^2}$ to be absolutely convergent?","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences']"

493887,How do I group unique pairs of sequential numbers in a grid?,"Not sure if this SE site the best place to help find a solution for this problem. I am open to suggestions! It basically boils down to this: Given a grid of numbers where the numbers are ordered sequentially across and down (typewriter-style), how do I get unique vertical pairs of numbers using a formula, so that applying the formula to any given number in the grid will provide it's paired number? Some rules.... There is always either an even number of columns or an even number of
rows The minimum number of columns is 1. The minimum number of rows is 2. A simple example would be a 6x2 grid: The pairs here are simple- 1-7, 2-8, 3-9, 4-10, 5-11, and 6-12.  If the function I am looking for was named myFunc, then in the simple 6x2 grid example above, myFunc(1) would return 7, and myFunc(7) would return 1. myFunc(4) would return 10, etc. I'd like to have good distribution of the pairs across the rows, too. So if we add 2 more rows to the example above, the pairs might look like this (color-coded here): The reds are pairs, like 1-13 and 2-20,  and the greens are pairs, like 7-19 and 8-14. This is just a suggestion of course; in a different version of pairing, 1-7 and 13-19 could be pairs, and 2-8 and 14-20 could be pairs, etc. I have come up with a formula in Excel which works for a 4-row grid of any number of columns. Unfortunately it is woefully inelegant and I wouldn’t even know how to best post it here. I can say it is a function of the MOD of the position number and row count, multiplied and added by the column count. And although it scales down to work with 2 rows, it does not scale to odd numbers of rows, or even 6 rows. ------ EDIT, 11 Hours Later ------ It would seem the ""magic"" of this lies in the calculated offset from the source number. Using the equation 1 + (ColNum mod (RowCount - 1)) it is easy to obtain the offset for the 1st row. Looking at the 1-13 pair, the offset is 2 (that is, the match is
found 2 rows away from row 1). Looking at the 2-20 pair, the offset is 3. Looking at the 3-9 pair, the offset 1. The pattern continues for as many columns that reside in the grid. So this 2,3,1 sequence also works for row 3 in a 4-row grid. We only need to do a little subtraction if the values exceed the maximum position in the grid. For me, it's easy to visualize if I drop a ""phantom"" grid below the first to show that match: So here if we look at the 6-12 match, it’s easy to see the 12 is one row away from the 6. But we can also see that the 6 is 3 rows away from the 12 (count down into the phantom grid). For the 2nd and 4th rows of a 4-row grid, the pattern of offsets is 2,1,3... It is this 2,3,1 and 2,1,3 sequence that is the secret! I will refer to this 1,2, or 3 value as the ""offset"".  So, I need to calculate the offset based on the following variables: RowCount (in this example, 4) ColCount (in this example, 6) RowNum (in this example, 1,2,3 or 4) ColNum (in this example, 1,2,3,4,5 or 6) Pos (in this example, 1 through 24) I have found other sequences that work, but have been unable to calculate them. For a 6-row grid, the sequences are Row1 - 2,3,4,5,1... Row2 - 2,3,4,1,5... Row3 - 4,3,1,5,2... Row4 - 4,3,5,1,2... Row5 - 5,3,2,1,4... And as if this all weren't hairy enough (at least for me!) if we are dealing with an odd number of rows, a position's match may not be in the same column!",['functions']

494161,The game of hand cricket.,"(If you could add a more suitable title, I'd be very grateful to you) My friend gave me this question: In the game of hand-cricket (hand baseball, if you like it :D) two players $X$ - the batsman and $Y$ - the bowler, randomly choose numbers from $1$ to $6$ (simultaneously). Now, if both put the same number, then player $X$ is declared out and the game ends (for $X$). If both put different numbers, then the score of $X$ is incremented by the number he chose. Before starting, the score of $X$ is $0$. If the game goes on like this, what is the most probable score of $X$? For example, if $X$ and $Y$ start by choosing $1$ and $6$, then the score of $X$ is 1. If $X$ puts $3$ and $Y$ puts $1$, then the score of $X$ becomes $4$. If $X$ and $Y$ both put $5$, then $X$ is out and the final score is $4$. The question was just to write a program to find the average score - nothing big at all. But I wondered if there should be an expected score. The Question :
Now, my question is why should there be a 'most probable score' at all? To investigate this, I just wrote a small program and it turns out that the average score is about $12$. Then, I changed the parameter $6$ to various numbers and I got various answers. If the parameter is increased, I get a greater average score and on reducing it, I get a lower average score. This seems quite sensible as by increasing the parameter, we are effectively reducing the chances of 'collision'. But is there any mathematical way to estimate the average score given a parameter $K$ such that the numbers chosen are between $1$ and $K$? Please note that I am not familiar with 'advanced' probability and such stuff, so if possible, give the answer in an intuitive way! Maybe I am asking too much. In that case, you may just tell that it is way above my current 'level'.","['statistics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

Mathematica knows that logarithms can be calculated as: $\log(n) = \lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s)$ Logarithms can be added to give the logarithm of the product of their argument, $\lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{6^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) = \lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) + \lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{3^{s-1}}\right) \zeta$ $\log(6) = \log(2) + \log(3)$ This works only when the limits lets $s \to 1$. Trying the same for example with the limit letting $s \to 2$, it fails, as can be seen in this example: $\lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{6^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) = \lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) + \lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{3^{s-1}}\right) \zeta$ which gives us: $\lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{6^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) = \lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{2^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) + \lim_{s\to 2} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{3^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s)$ which evaluated is: $\frac{5 \pi ^2}{36} = \frac{\pi ^2}{12} + \frac{\pi ^2}{9}$ but then we would have: $\frac{5 \pi ^2}{36} = \frac{7 \pi ^2}{36}$ which is not true. Looking at the logarithm above again, as a zeta function limit, we have: $\log(n) = \lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s)$ In this question it was shown in the answer that logarithms have these numerators in their Dirichlet series: $$1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]$$ which as a matrix is: $$\begin{bmatrix} 0&0&0&0&0&0&0 \\ 1&-1&1&-1&1&-1&1 \\ 1&1&-2&1&1&-2&1 \\ 1&1&1&-3&1&1&1 \\ 1&1&1&1&-4&1&1 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&-5&1 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&1&-6 \end{bmatrix}$$ which is an infinite matrix where each row is the numerators in the Dirichlet series that converges to $\log(n)$ for $s=1$. In the zeta function limit for logarithms the part within the parentheses $\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right)$ in $\log(n) = \lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s)$ will go towards zero in the limit: $\lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right) = 0$ In a different matrix: $$\displaystyle T = \begin{bmatrix} +1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1 \\ +1&-1&+1&-1&+1&-1&+1 \\ +1&+1&-2&+1&+1&-2&+1 \\ +1&-1&+1&-1&+1&-1&+1 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&-4&+1&+1 \\ +1&-1&-2&-1&+1&+2&+1 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&-6 \end{bmatrix}$$ where $\Lambda(n) = \displaystyle \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{T(n,k)}{k}$, and where $\Lambda(n)$ is the von Mangoldt function as proven in the answer to this question, we have the triangle: $$\displaystyle \begin{bmatrix} +1 \\ +1&-1&=0 \\ +1&+1&-2&=0 \\ +1&-1&+1&-1&=0 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&-4&=0 \\ +1&-1&-2&-1&+1&+2&=0 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&-6&=0 \end{bmatrix}$$ where we see that the row sums are also zero. Looking again at the earlier matrix we see the same thing (with exception of the first row, but $\Lambda(0) = 0$ anyways): $$\displaystyle \begin{bmatrix} 0=0 \\ 1&-1=0 \\ 1&1&-2=0 \\ 1&1&1&-3=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&-4=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&-5=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&1&-6=0 \end{bmatrix}$$ writing zeta function limits of this latter matrix, and we have: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(\frac{1}{1^{s-1}}-\frac{1}{2^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s) = \log (2)$$

we find when we scroll down to sequence https://oeis.org/A177885 the following formula: $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2 \pi  i \exp (1) \left(n-\frac{11}{8}\right)}{\exp (1) W\left(\frac{n-\frac{11}{8}}{\exp (1)}\right)}$$ involving the Lambert_W function for a good approximation of the n-th Riemann zeta zero.
$W(x)$ or LambertW is undocumented in Mathematica as said in Mathworld, and the ProductLog[x] command is used instead. There is also a functional relation between the sequence from the zeta limits and the $1, 4, 27, 256, 3125, 46656, 823543...$ sequence which is as follows: $$\frac{x}{W(-x)} = x \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{(W(-x)+1)^n}$$ Changing the argument $-x$ to $x$ we have the function used in the zeta zero approximation formula. This warrants some further investigation of the sequence $1, 2, 9/2, 32/3, 625/24, 324/5, 117649/720...$  from the zeta function limits. Setting the denominators equal to $\exp(n)^{s-1}$: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(\frac{1}{\exp ^{s-1}(1)}-\frac{1}{\exp ^{s-1}(2)}\right) \zeta (s) =1$$

Reversing the triangular matrix:
$$\displaystyle \begin{bmatrix} 0=0 \\ 1&-1=0 \\ 1&1&-2=0 \\ 1&1&1&-3=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&-4=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&-5=0 \\ 1&1&1&1&1&1&-6=0 \end{bmatrix}$$

In other words there seems to be an invariance property. Converting back to unexponentiated denominators: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \left(\frac{1}{(1+2)^{s-1}}-\frac{1}{(2+2)^{s-1}}\right) \zeta (s)=\log \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)$$

compared to the earlier:
$1, 2, 9/2, 32/3, 625/24, 324/5, 117649/720...$
in other words, no invariance like with the triangular numbers. Drawing this further we generalize and write: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^n \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}$$

I tried to permute indexes $j$,$n$ and $k$ in an attempt to transpose the matrix but I did not succeed. In addition to the known (conjectured): $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^n \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}=\frac{n^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}$$ a oeis search and some manipulation gives the following: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=n+1}^{n+n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}=\frac{n^{n-1}}{\frac{(n-1)! (2 n-1)\text{!!}}{n!}}$$ The following appears to be an example of a relationship: $$\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^n \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}=\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^{n+n+n+n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}+\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=n+1}^{n+n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}+\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=n+n+1}^{n+n+n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}+\lim_{s\to 1} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=n+n+n+1}^{n+n+n+n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}$$ for $n$ an integer $\geq 1$. Also the limit $s \to 1$ seems be possible to put to any complex number $S=a+i b$, $s \to S$. So the question repeated is: Does:
$$\sum _{m=1}^t \lim_{s\to \text{S}} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=(m-1) n+1}^{m n} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}$$ equal: $$\lim_{s\to \text{S}} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^{n t} \frac{1-\text{If}[k \bmod n=0,n,0]}{k^{s-1}}$$ for any complex number $S=a+i b$ and integer values of $n \geq 1$ and $t \geq 1 $? The question seems to simplify to the following identity
$$\sum _{m=1}^t \lim_{s\to \text{S}} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=(m-1) n+1}^{m n} \frac{1}{k^{s-1}}=\lim_{s\to \text{S}} \, \zeta (s) \sum _{k=1}^{n t} \frac{1}{k^{s-1}}$$ for $S$ a complex number not equal to $1$ and $n=1,2,3,4,5,...$ and $t=1,2,3,4,5,...$ S = 1.23456789 + I*9.87654321

Once there, choose a new direction at random  and repeat the process.  The problem is to determine the probability that the particle will be given distance away from the initial point at a given time in the future. I realized that t is hard to find such a probability explicitly, but if the cylinder is very narrow and the particle moves very fast (with speed proportional to the reciprocal of the radius) you can use the central limit theorem to obtain an explicit (Gaussian) approximation.

I do not yet see the beauty of this problem but, i wanted to prove this atleast. So,what i have tried is : I fix $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and assume $H\leq G$ with $|G/H|=n$ As we have $H\leq G$ of finite index, we have the action of $G$ on left cosets of $H$ and we get $\eta: G\rightarrow S_n$ I assume $\{g_1,g_2,\dots, g_r\}$ generate $G$ what i am thinking is once $H$ is fixed, the homomorphism is fixed $\eta$ (after all it is left multiplication of cosets of H). (otherway may not be true.. i dont see it immediately) and any homomorphism of $G$ is fixed by all these $g_i :1\leq i\leq r$ each $g_i$ have $n!$ possibilities as its image. So all $g_i : 1\leq i\leq r$ would have $n!n!\dots n!$ repeating $r$ times i.e., $(n!)^r$ times.. and as these homomorphism (i am not sure but somethings may not correspond to H) are finite. Thus , I see that No.of $H$ should be atmost $(n!)^r$ (after excludind some useless cases) So, I would like to say that If a group is finitely generated, then there are finitely many subgroups of a given finite index. I am very much sure that there are some gaps which i am unable to see.. please help e to fill this in detail (if this way is partially true)by giving some hints or please suggest me another approach (if this is a blunder).

494479,A relative compactness criterion in $\ell^p$,"There is a relative compactness criterion for subset of $\ell^p$ that seems to me to be almost unheard-of (I say that because a google search provided no proofs nor references) but that is very useful: Theorem. For any $p$, $1\leq p < \infty$, a bounded subset $K$ of $\ell^p$ is relatively compact if and only if $\displaystyle\lim_{n_\epsilon} \sum_{i=n_\epsilon}^\infty \vert k_i \rvert^p = 0$, uniformly for $k \in K$. This theorem is assigned as exercise in Diestel (see below) and is widely applied in Costara-Popa in order to prove relative compactness in $\ell^p$ (a classical example is to show that the operator $T : \ell^p \to \ell^p$ defined by $( T a )_n = \lambda_n a_n$ for all $a \in \ell^p$ is compact iff $(l_n) \in c_0$). However, I founded its proof rather tricky. My idea is essentially showing that a subset such as in theorem is totally bounded. (since in this way the result follows by well-established equivalence between totally boundeness and relative compactness in metric spaces.) Thus, chosen $\epsilon >0$, I was looking for a finite collection $S$ of vectors in $\ell^p$ such that every vector in $K$ is far from at last one vector in $S$ less than $\epsilon$. 
The condition in theorem means that, fixed $\eta > 0$, there exists $n_\eta \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $\sum_{i=n}^\infty \lvert k_i \rvert^p < \eta^p$ and $n_\eta$ is the same for all $k \in K$ (depending only on $\eta$). Furthermore, since $K$ is bounded, there exists $M>0$ s.t. $\lVert k \rVert_p \leq M$ for all $k\in K$. So I'd consider a collection of vectors $u^{(j)}$ that have only $n_\eta$ non-zero components and set their values in such a way that \begin{equation}
\lVert k- u^{(j)} \rVert_ p^p = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p =\sum_{i=1}^{n_\eta} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p + \sum_{i=n_\eta}^\infty \lvert k_i \rvert^p < \epsilon^p
\end{equation} Since the second summation in the third term is less than $\eta^p$ (and $\eta$ could be arbitrary small, in particular smaller than $\epsilon$), it remains only to show that it is possible to have $\sum_{i=1}^{n_\epsilon} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p \leq \epsilon^p - \eta^p$. Set $r^p = \frac{\epsilon^p - \eta^p}{n_\eta ( M+1 ) }$ and choose $N \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $Nr^p \geq M$. Suppose that each component of $u^{(j)}$ takes one of the $2N + 1$ values $0, \pm r^p, \pm 2r^p, \dots, \pm N r^p$. Since $-M \leq k_i \leq M$ for every $i \leq n_\eta$, there exists an integer $C$ with $-N + 1 \leq C \leq N$ s.t. $(C - 1 )r^p \leq k_i \leq C r^p$. Then set $u_i^{(j)} = C r^p$. Thus
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n_\epsilon} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p < \epsilon^p - \eta^p
\end{equation} by construction. Now, the number of different vectors $u^{(j)}$ we can construct in this way is finite when $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ are fixed, hence $K$ is totally bounded. I think this attempt works (I have adapted the proof of compactness of Lipschitz functions space in bounded functions space found in an italian book of mathematical analysis), but at the same time it seems to be rather messy. I valued other possibilities (such as apply the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem), but this one appeared to be the most promising. So I wonder if there are other clearer proofs or references in which this theorem is proved. References. J. Diestel, Sequences and series in Banach spaces , chp 1, ex 6, C. Costara, D.

of the set $A + B$. First, we need to show that $\sup(A) + \sup(B)$
is an upper bound for the set $A + B$. Indeed, if $z\in A + B$,
then there exists $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ such that $z = a + b$. But by
definition of $\sup(A)$ and $\sup(B)$, $a \leq \sup(A)$ and $b \leq \sup(B)$, so
$z = a + b \leq \sup(A) + \sup(B)$. So, $\sup(A) + \sup(B)$ is an upper
bound for $A + B$. We now wish to show that $\sup(A) + \sup(B)$ is the least upper
bound for the set $A + B$. So, if $u$ is an upper bound for $A + B$,
we need to show that $\sup(A)+\sup(B) \leq u$. We will use part (i):
that is, we need to show that there exists $\varepsilon > 0$, $\sup(A) + \sup(B) < u + \varepsilon$. To do this, note that since $\sup(A)$ is the least upper bound for
$A$, $\sup(A) - \varepsilon/2$ is not an upper bound for A, so there exists an
$a\in A$ so that $\sup(A) - \varepsilon/2 < a$. Similarly, there is a $b\in B$ so that $\sup(B) - \varepsilon/2 < b$. Adding these two inequalities gives
$$
\sup(A) + \sup(B) - \varepsilon  < a + b;
$$
in other words
$$
\sup(A) + \sup(B) < a + b + \varepsilon.
$$
But $u$ is an upper bound for the set $A + B$, so $a + b \leq u$, and
hence we have
$$
\sup(A) + \sup(B) < u + \varepsilon.
$$
Thus, by part (i), $\sup(A) + \sup(B) \leq u$, so $\sup(A) + \sup(B)$ is
the least upper bound for $A + B$, as required. Now how do I show that $\sup(A+B)$ exists?","['solution-verification', 'order-theory', 'real-analysis', 'alternative-proof', 'proof-writing']"

494558,"Proving that Union of a finite number of complete subsets of metric space $(X,d)$ is complete.","We have following 3 definitions. Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. A sequence $(\textbf{x}_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of points in $X$ is said to be a Cauchy sequence , if, given any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that $d(\textbf{x}_m,\textbf{x}_n)<\epsilon$ whenever $N\le n<m$. Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and that $S\subseteq X$. We say that $S$ is complete if and only if every Cauchy sequence in $S$ has a limit in $S$. Definition: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and that $S\subseteq X$. We say that $S$ is compact if and only if every sequence in $S$ has a convergent subsequence with limit in S. And are the proofs of the 3 following theorem correct? Theorem 1: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. Intersection of any collection of complete subsets of $X$ is complete. Proof: Let $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, an intersection of any collection $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ of complete subsets of $X$. Since $(\textbf{x}_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, it is a Cauchy sequence in $A_1$. Since $A_1$ is complete, $\textbf x_n \rightarrow \textbf x$ where $\textbf x \in A_1$. Similarly, since $(\textbf{x}_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, it is a Cauchy sequence in $A_2$. Since $A_2$ is complete, $\textbf x \in A_2$. Without loss of generality, $\textbf x \in A_i$ for all $I\in I$. $\therefore x\in \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$. Hence $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, the intersection of any collection of complete subsets of $X$ is complete. Theorem 2: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. The intersection of a compact set and a closed set in $X$ is compact. Proof: Denote $E\subseteq X$ to be the compact set in $X$ and $W$ to be a closed set in $X$. We know that a compact set in a metric space is also complete and complete sets are closed in $X$. Therefore $E$ is closed. Now, $E \cap W$ is a closed set, since intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed. And $E \cap W \subseteq E$. Now, suppose that $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a sequence in $E \cap W$ and so in $E$. Since $E$ is compact, $(\textbf{x}_n)$ has a convergent subsequence with limit $\textbf x$, say. If $\textbf x=\textbf x_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then clearly $\textbf x \in E\cap W$. If $\textbf x \neq \textbf x_n$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then $\textbf x$ is an accumulation point of $E\cap W$, so that $\textbf x \in E\cap W$ since $E\cap W$ is closed. Hence, $E\cap W$, the intersection of a compact set and a closed set in $X$ is compact, since every sequence in $E\cap W$ has a convergent subsequence in $E\cap W$. Theorem 3: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. The intersection of any collection of compact sets in $X$ is compact. Proof: Let $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ be any collection compact sets of $X$. For all $I\in I$, $A_i$ is a closed set, since compact sets are closed. Moreover, intersection of any collection of closed sets in $X$ is closed, hence $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ is a closed set. Also, we have $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i \subseteq A_1$. Now, suppose that $(\textbf{x}_n)$ be a sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ and so in $A_1$. Since $A_1$ is compact, $(\textbf{x}_n)$ has a convergent subsequence with limit $\textbf x$, say. If $\textbf x=\textbf x_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then clearly $\textbf x \in \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$. If $\textbf x \neq \textbf x_n$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then $\textbf x$ is an accumulation point of $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, so that $\textbf x \in \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ since $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ is closed. Hence, $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$, the intersection of any collection of compact sets in $X$ is compact, since every sequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ has a convergent subsequence in $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$. And how would you prove the following theorem? Theorem: Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a metric space. Union of a finite number of complete subsets of $X$ is complete.

Then the set $$C+C=\{x+y:x\in C,y\in C\}$$ coincides with the segment $[0,2]$. It seems to me the Cantor  discontinuum is the Cantor Ternary Set in $\Bbb R$, not a perfect and nowhere dense subset of of $\Bbb R$ in general. But I'm not sure. In addition, I have no clue why ""from the geometric viewpoint, it is almost evident that $$C \times C = \bigcap\{Z_n : n < \omega\}$$ $\ldots$"" Here's the proof: Proof. We can use the standard geometric argument presented, for example, in $[155]$. Namely, let us introduce a mapping $$\phi:\bf\mathbf R\times\mathbf R\to\mathbf R$$ defined by $$\phi(x,y)=x+y\qquad(x\in\mathbf R,\:y\in\mathbf R).$$ This mapping can be described in another way. Denoting $$l=\{(x,y)\in\mathbf R\times\mathbf R:x+y=0\},$$ we see that $\phi$ is identical with the projection $$pr_l:\mathbf R\times\mathbf R\to\mathbf R\times\{0\}$$ whose direction is determined by the straight line $l$. Now, from the geometric viewpoint it is almost evident that $$C\times C=\cap\{Z_n:n\lt\omega\},$$ where $\{Z_n:n\lt\omega\}$ is some decreasing (with respect to inclusion) sequence of compact subsets of the unit square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ and, in addition, the equality $$pr_l(Z_n)=[0,2]$$ holds for any natural number $n$. This fact readily implies, by virtue of the compactness of all sets $Z_n$, that the relation $$pr_l(C\times C)=[0,2]$$ holds true, too, which is equivalent to the relation $C+C=[0,2]$.

$$ now maybe I am making this more complex than it is. And maybe it's just a notation problem (I really hate the dot notation sometimes because I feel it obscures things, but I need to know it, I know). If we assume that when r changes, $\phi$ and $\theta$ and their unit vectors stay the same, then we can safely say that $\frac{d \hat{\boldsymbol\phi}}{dr} = 0$ and $\frac{d \hat{\boldsymbol\theta}}{d r} = 0.$ (someone please tell me if i am wrong). If we do the same thing with changing θ and $\phi$ though, the result is different. hen we change θ, r has to change because it changes direction, and when we change $\phi$ $r$ has to change because it changes direction in that case also. When I take the derivative of $\hat{r}$ with respect to $\theta$, I get the following: $$\frac{d \bf \hat{r}}{d\theta} = \bf \hat{x} \rm \cos\theta \cos\phi + \bf \hat{y} \rm \cos \theta \sin \phi - \bf \hat{z}\rm\sin\theta $$ which as it happens also is equal to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ Now, if I look at $\bf \vec{r} \rm = r \bf \hat{r}$ and take the derivative w/r/t time, I should get $\frac{d \bf \vec{r} \rm}{dt} = r \frac{d\bf \hat{r}}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt}\bf \hat{r} \rm$ I notice that this happens (and some of this is just seeing the notation):
$$
\frac{d \bf \vec{r} \rm}{dt} = r \frac{d\bf \hat{r}}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt}\bf \hat{r} \rm = \dot{r} \bf \hat{r} \rm + r \hat{\boldsymbol \theta} \rm $$ ANd I feel like I am almost there. But I am having trouble making that last step. I am getting a bit frustrated because I can't seem to make the differentiation work the way it does in the text and I haven't found a derivation online that matches up with anything I have seen in class.

I have made some good progress compared to what I knew about probability some weeks ago BUT, I am still very unsure of myself, and ... I have to say I found it difficult to find reliable sources on the topic, and text books or documents on the internet explaining things really clearly. For example, while learning (reading) about sampling distribution and CLT, I wanted to understand why $E[\bar X] = \mu$. I think I get it right here! So I understand this from all the books I read on the topic. You have a population (lets say finite) and you have lots elements in it which you call $x_1, x_2, ... x_N$ where $N$ is the total number of elements in the population (since the population is finite). Good. Now you can compute the population mean as: $\mu = {1\over N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ The expected value equation is: $E[X] = \sum_{i=1} {p_i X_i}$ Imagine you have 10 cards labelled with numbers on them (0, 1, or 2), and that you have 3 0s, 5 1s, and 2 2s. Now you could compute the mean of this population by doing: $\mu = {1 \over 10}(0+0+1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2) = 1.1$$ and you could use the expected value formulation, knowing that assuming you know your population distribution before hand, you can say that your sample space is S={0,1,2} ( is that correct, your sample space are the possible outcomes? ). So the probability distribution would be Pr(0) = 0.2, Pr(1) = 0.5 and Pr(2) = 0.3. Thus: E[X] = 0.2 * 0 + 0.5 * 1 + 0.3 * 2 = 1.1$$ Great we get the same results. Now we don't want (because the population is too large or even infinite) to compute the population mean so we use a sample mean instead. We draw elements from the population, for instance $n$ of them and compute their average: $\bar X = {1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ I think I am confused here because we use $X_i$ on the right inside instead of $x$. I understand it this way: imagine you randomly draw a number between 1 and 10, imagine it is r = 3, and this number indicates the card you need to pick from the population of 10 cards (you shuffled the cards before and put them on the table from left to right). The number on this card is 2. So what $X_i$ is in the above equation for the sample mean is this number 2. Correct? This is our random variable which we could write $X_1 = 2$ (we put the card back on the table, draw with replacement, shuffle the cards again, etc.) and we repeat this experience $n$ times to get the following series of Xs: $X_1 = 2, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 1, ... X_n = 2$. And finally we compute our sample mean which is an average of all these Xs: $\bar X = {1 \over n} (2 + 0 + 1 + ... 2)$ where the $1 \over n$ is there because again the way we drew the cards from the population was done in a ""uniform"" way (we didn't ""give more importance"" to cards on the left for instance when we drew them). So back to our problem, proving that $E[\bar X] = \mu$. I think I get it wrong here! Unfortunately I am lost here! So if I understand the equation for the expected mean correctly it's a sum of weighted random variables (where the weight is the probability associated with this random variable). So technically if we wanted to calculated the expected value of a sample mean (where the sample mean is already a mean of drawn elements from the population), we would need to calculate many samples means, weight them with their associated probability (which I understand in this case is close to a normal distribution) and add up the results. No ? $E[\bar X] = \sum_{i=1}^{NN} w_i \bar X_i$ where $\bar X_1 = {1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, $\bar X_2 = {1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, etc. So I think I am thinking wrong at this point because in books they define this expected value differently, they say since: $\bar X = {1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ thus $E[\bar X] = E[{1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i]$ $E[\bar X] = {1 \over n}E[X_1] + {1 \over n}E[X_2] + ... {1 \over n}E[X_n]$ and then they say something incredible in the sense to me not justified at all, which is that ""since the expected value of a random value is the mean"" (WHERE IS THAT PROVED?) EDIT: so I realise that I wrote above that $E[X]$ and the $\mu$ with my card example were the same, the problem I have with that, is that my example was only working with discrete r.v. and finite population. I believe to hold true, the $E[\bar X] = \mu$ equality should be proved for any population (finite or not) and a r.v that is either continuous or discrete. Does such a proof exist? then we have: $E[\bar X] = n \times {1 \over n} \mu = \mu$ So where I would really like to get some help, is really on the last part. 1) why do we compute the expected value of the mean as $E[\bar X] = E[{1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i]$ rather than with the equation for the expected value $\sum_{i=1} {p_i X_i}$? 2) where is this coming from? ""Since $X_1, X_2, ... X_n$ are each random variable, their expected value will be equal to the probability mean $\mu$."" ????? I know the post is very long, but I hope this will be useful to many more people in the future, trying to understand why we use x rather than X, etc., etc. But if the real mathematicians out there, could please help me doing the last miles on my journey to ""starting to understand"" statistics it would be FANTASTIC!

If possible, don't give complete solutions, since I need all training I can possibly get :) Problem. The function $f$ is defined by $$f(x)=\frac{1-\sqrt{x}}{1+\sqrt{x}}\,,\:\: x>0\,.$$
Show that $f$ is injective in as many ways as possible. My thoughts. I have started by showing that $f$ is strictly increasing by showing that $f(x+\epsilon)-f(x)>0$ for any positive $\epsilon$ (we have not introduced derivatives yet, so I guess that was the best way to do it, but perhaps there are more efficient methods? ). By the definition of injectivity, that implies that $f$ also is injective. Is that an acceptable solution? I also tried to find an inverse by solving $y=f(x)$ for $x$. This gave me $$\sqrt{x}=\frac{1-y}{1+y}\Longrightarrow x=\left(\frac{1-y}{1+y}\right)^2,$$ but I am not entirely sure what I should do about the implication. Actually, I am not even sure if it's a problem. Except this, I also wonder if there are any other ways that I can show the injectivity of $f$.","['calculus', 'functions']"
494874,Need help showing supremum does not exist,"(i) S is a subset of R and β ∈ R. Let T = {s + β : s ∈  S }. Show that if Sup S exists, then so does sup T. Moreover, Sup T = β + Sup S. (ii) Using what you have proved in (i), show that if x ∈ R, x ≠ 0 and S =  {gx : g ∈ Z }, then Sup S does not exist. Here is my proof for (i) Let the upper bound of S be called m. Then m > s for all s ∈ S.  By property of real numbers, we can say that m + β > s+ β for some β ∈  R. Thus, we see that every s+ β ∈ T is an upper bound of T. T is bounded upwards.
Our hypothesis implies that S has a least upper bound. Let Sup S = s' => if x < s', then x is not an upper bound of S. By property of real numbers, if x + β < s' + β, then x  + β is not an upper bound of T. T also has a least upper bound, which is Sup T = s' + β => Sup T = β + Sup S as desired. I got to (ii) and somehow am not seeing the light on where to start. Any pointers?",['analysis']

494918,"Showing that if every open subspace is Lindelöf, then the space is hereditarily Lindelöf.","Background : A topological space $X$ is said to be Lindelöf if for every cover $\mathcal O$ of $X$ by open subsets of $X$, there is some $\mathcal C\subseteq\mathcal O$  such that $\mathcal C$ is a countable cover of $X.$ (If Axiom of Countable Choice holds, this is equivalent to saying that every open cover of $X$ admits a countable open refinement .) A space is hereditarily Lindelöf if every subspace of $X$ is Lindelöf. It is easily shown that closed subspaces of Lindelöf spaces are again Lindelöf (similar to showing that closed subspaces of compact spaces are again compact). I'm trying to show the following Proposition : $[\mathsf{ZF} +$ Countable Choice$]$ A space is hereditarily Lindelöf if and only if every open subspace is Lindelöf. One implication is trivial, but I'm stuck on the other. (I know how to prove it if we know that every open subspace is $\sigma$-compact , but I'm not sure how we can conclude this.) What I've got so far : Let $Y$ be an arbitrary (non-empty proper) subspace of $X$, $\mathcal O$ a cover of $Y$ by relatively open subsets of $Y$, $U$ the interior of $Y$ (with respect to the topology on $X$). Then considering $U$ as a subspace of $Y$ (so a subspace of $X$, since $Y$ is a subspace of $X$), $\mathcal O':=\{U\cap V:V\in\mathcal O\}$ is a cover of $U$ by relatively open subsets of $U,$ so since $U$ is an open subspace of $X$, then $U$ is Lindelöf, so $\mathcal O'$ admits a countable subset $\mathcal C_0$ such that $\mathcal C_0$ covers $U.$ $\mathcal C_0$ is readily an open refinement of $\mathcal O$ (since $U$ is an open subspace of $Y$) by definition of $\mathcal O'$--though of course, we can't conclude that $\mathcal C_0$ covers $Y$, since we didn't assume that $Y$ is open in $X$ (so that $Y=U$). What I'd like to do at this point : Letting $\mathcal O''$ be the set of all open subsets $V$ of $X$ such that $Y\cap V\in\mathcal O,$ I would like to prove the following Conjecture : The boundary of $Y$ is contained in $\bigcup\mathcal O''.$ If I can manage that, then I can see how to use Lindelöf-ness of closed subspaces together with Countable Choice to induce a countable open refinement $\mathcal C_1$ of $\mathcal O$ such that $Y\setminus U\subseteq\bigcup\mathcal C_1,$ whence $\mathcal C:=\mathcal C_0\cup\mathcal C_1$ is a countable open refinement of $\mathcal O$ that covers $Y$. Unfortunately, I am stymied in my attempts to show that for boundary points $z$ of $Y$ with $z\notin Y,$ there is an open subset $V$ of $X$ with $z\in V$ and $Y\cap V\in\mathcal O$. I'm beginning to suspect that my conjecture may not be true. If it were true, then as an alternate approach, we could simply cover the closure of $Y$ by $\mathcal O'',$ which would induce a relatively open cover of the closure of $Y$, which (by Lindelöf-ness of closed subspaces) we could then reduce to a countable subcover, which would induce a countable subcover of $\mathcal O.$ Primary Question : If my Proposition and Conjecture hold, can anyone can give me any hints how I might show this (or, if you prefer, confirmation of my Conjecture's truth, together with hints at any simpler/more elegant approaches)? If my Proposition holds but my Conjecture doesn't, can anyone prompt an alternate way that I should proceed instead (and for bonus points, a counterexample to my Conjecture)? If a stronger Choice principle is required for my Proposition to hold, how much Choice is sufficient, and how might I proceed? Secondary Question : It seems that Countable Choice is necessary for my Proposition to hold, but is it possible to prove it with less Choice than that?","['general-topology', 'axiom-of-choice']"
