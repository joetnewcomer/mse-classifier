279657,Graham scan convex hull algorithm - include all points on boundary,"I have am implementing the Graham scan algorithm to find the convex hull of a set of (two-dimensional) points. (My implementation is in Haskell in case anyone wants to know.) The problem is that not all of the boundary points are included. In fact, my implementation is highly sensitive to the order of the points in the input (since the input is technically a list, not a set). I am looking for some help from a mathematical perspective in order to fix the problem. To start, let me describe how I understand the algorithm: Input: $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ . Output: The convex hull $H$ of $S$ Define the point $P$ as follows: First find the subset $Y$ of $S$ of all points $(x, y)$ such that $y$ is minimum. Then $P$ is the point in $Y$ such that $x$ is minimum. Define $\preceq$ on $S$ as $P_1 \preceq P_2$ iff $\theta_1 \leq \theta_2$ where $(r_i, \theta_i)$ is the polar representation of the vector $\vec{PP_i}$ . Define the sequence $A = \{P_i\}$ such that $P_i \in S$ and $P_i \preceq P_{i+1}$ for each $i$ . Define $H_0 = A$ . Define the subsequence $H_i=\{Q_i\}$ of $H_{i-1}$ by removing the point $P_j$ from $H_{i-1}$ such that the angle $\angle P_jP_{j+1}P_{j+2}$ makes a right-hand turn and $j$ is minimum. Let $H=H_i$ where $H_i$ contains no angle $\angle P_jP_{j+1}P_{j+2}$ which makes a right-hand turn. Now for a more concrete example to explain the problem: Let $S = \{(x, y) : x, y \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \leq x, y \leq 4\}$ . (Since my implementation uses a list rather than a set, $S$ is actually a the sequence $S=\{P_i\}$ of these points in lexicographical order.) From step 1, $P = (0, 0)$ . My implementation also uses a stable sort, so for $P_i, P_j \in S$ , if $\theta_i = \theta_j$ (again using polar coordinates for the points), then $P_i \prec P_j$ if $i < j$ . This creates a problem as I consider the points $(0, 1)$ , $(0, 2)$ , $(0, 3)$ , and $(0, 4)$ in step 4 because they appear in the sequence $S$ in that order and they are the vertices for angles with right-handed turns when they are considered. For example, the angle formed by the points $(x, y)$ , $(0, 1)$ , $(0, 2)$ where $x \not=0$ is a right-handed turn. How do I modify the ordering of step 2 so that the points on the boundary appear in the correct order to obtain straight angles as I consider them in step 4? p.s. I have decided to state my question in mathematical terms, but if you think I would get more/better feedback from programmers, I will post it on SO instead and try to frame it in programming terms. Addendum: My implementation in Haskell keeps the points $\{(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)\}$ as it searches for the convex hull. The remaining points to check are $\{(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)\}$ , in that order. The angle formed by $(1, 4)$ , $(0, 1)$ , $(0, 2)$ is a right-hand turn, so $(0, 1)$ is discarded. Similarly, the points $(0, 2)$ and $(0, 3)$ are discarded. Finally, $(0, 4)$ is correctly retained. I need a way to ensure that these points are encountered in the order $(0, 4)$ , $(0, 3)$ , $(0, 2)$ , $(0, 1)$ so that no right-hand turns will be found and all of these boundary points will be retained. This is just an example, so I need to find a general solution to avoid this kind of problem.","['geometry', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"

279670,When does the next complex split occur?,"So I was thinking about complex numbers and how they came about and someting interesting occured to me: the formation of complex numbers occurs because there exists a function (namely $f(x)=x^2$) that maps reals to a smaller subset of reals and therefore the by setting the equation $x^2 = p$ in $\{x\in\Bbb R:x\not\in f(\Bbb R)\}$. 
We are forced to create a new mathemtical value, $i$ to handle the equation. Couldn't this extension occur elsewhere? For example, say there is some function $f_{\Bbb C}$ that maps the complex numbers to a smaller subset of the complex numbers then the expression $f_{\Bbb C}(x) = j$ in $\{z\in\Bbb C:z\not\in f_{\Bbb C}(\Bbb C)\}$ will require the creation of a new mathematical constant. Is this possible? Has it ever happened? This differs greatly from quaternions and other tools which are considered extensions of the complex plane. The most basic idea that comes to mind is the absolute value function. The equation: $|x| = c$ where $c$ is not a positive real number or $0$ but is a member of the complex plane. You would get numbers $p$, such that $|p| = -1$, and $t$ such that $|t| = i$. From there the expression $p\cdot t$ would be such that $|p\cdot t| = -i$. Then an entire algebra from these can be constructed. But the only reason I'm not satisfied with this answer is because Complex numbers were naturally developed from the basic hyperoperators (addition -- multiplication -- powers (produces complex numbers) --> tetration ---> pentation etc...) Is there some hyperoperator down the line that will produce the next complex number?","['complex-numbers', 'clifford-algebras', 'complex-analysis']"

279737,Applications of Residue Theorem in complex analysis?,"Does anyone know the applications of Residue Theorem in complex analysis? I would like to do a quick paper on the matter, but am not sure where to start. The residue theorem The residue theorem, sometimes called Cauchy's residue theorem (one of many things named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy), is a powerful tool to evaluate line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves; it can often be used to compute real integrals as well. It generalizes the Cauchy integral theorem and Cauchy's integral formula. From a geometrical perspective, it is a special case of the generalized Stokes' theorem. Illustration of the setting The statement is as follows:
  Suppose $U$ is a simply connected open subset of the complex plane, and $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are finitely many points of $U$ and $f$ is a function which is defined and holomorphic on $U\setminus\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$. If $\gamma$ is a rectifiable curve in $U$ which does not meet any of the $a_k$, and whose start point equals its endpoint, then

279872,Is odd continuous function differentiable at $x=0$?,"Suppose that $f(x)$ is continuous and odd: $f(-x) = - f(x)$.
Does it have a derivative at $x=0$? Here is what I got so far: First we calculate $f(0)$ using $f(-0) = -f(0)$, from which $f(0) = 0$.
Then we calculate $f'(0)$ as follows:
$$
f'(0) = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}
= \lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(x)}{x}\,.
$$
But the limit from the left is equal to the limit from the right:
$$
\lim_{x\to0^-}\frac{f(x)}{x}
=\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{f(-x)}{-x}
=\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{-f(x)}{-x}
=\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{f(x)}{x}\,,
$$
which means that as long as the limit from the right exists, the function is differentiable at $x=0$. The limit is of the type $\frac{0}{0}$, since both $x$ and $f(x)$ goes zero at $x=0$. However, since $f(x)$ is continuous and $f(0)=0$, then in the vicinity of $x=0$, it must have a well defined value and the limit should exist. However, I didn't figure out how to finish the proof. I've been trying to construct counter examples.
A simple example is $f(x) = x^2 \sin \frac{1}{x}$, which is continuous (we define $f(0)=0$) and odd, with the derivative $f(x) = 2x\sin \frac{1}{x} - \cos \frac{1}{x}$,
which oscillates between -1 and 1 around $x=0$. But at $x=0$, the derivative should be equal to zero, because $\frac{f(x)}{x} = x \sin \frac{1}{x}$ which goes to zero. So the derivative does exist at $x=0$ here.","['parity', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

279886,"Why do the reals need to be constructed? Do they somehow ""span"" the rationals, the roots, and the transcendentals like e and pi?","Here is my question.  Why do the reals need to be ""constructed"" by this bizarre ""Dedekind cut"" or ""equivalence class of Cauchy sequences"" argument?  Why can't they simply be ""observed"" as consisting of all numbers that ""span"" some known sets of numbers? I am thinking here, in part, by analogy with linear algebra and with the complex numbers, where $i$, the square root of $-1$, is really all you need, in addition to the reals, to get all complex numbers as a spanning set of $1$ and $i$ over $\mathbb R$.  (Every complex number may be expressed as $a\cdot 1 + b\cdot i$ where $a, b\in\mathbb R$.) We have a couple of known transcendental numbers, $e$ and $\pi$.  We have all the rationals.  We have all the square roots most of which are irrational.  We have all the fractional roots of $e$ and $\pi$. We have the $e$th roots of all the numbers that exist, and the $\pi$th roots. Maybe we also have some other sets of transcendental numbers out there that we can use? What I am trying to ask is, are we using these ""Dedekind cuts"" and ""equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences"" just because we don't ""know enough real numbers yet"", because their characterization hasn't occurred to us yet, or do we already have enough real numbers in our arsenal, like e and pi, to make a ""spanning set"" without using equivalence classes of infinite sequences and the like, or, is it the case that we really have to use these kinds of constructions of the reals, for some deep mathematical reason? It just doesn't seem right.  Because you have to admit, by identifying ""sets of numbers"" like Dedekind cuts and equivalent classes of Cauchy sequences which are both sets of numbers, with actual numbers , mathematicians create (at least in my mind) some cause for doubt about what they are doing here with the reals.  A ""set"" seems like a strangely undefined term, which I understand, but not well, is subject to various kinds of paradoxes and levels of analysis problems.  (This last paragraph may be more of a separate question, about the validity of using sets of numbers as numbers, from the first question, which is more about why aren't there simpler ways to define or understand the real numbers in terms of numbers and operations we already understand.)","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Example: If you start with the permutation $\{2, 1, 4, 3\},$ then there are $9$ possibilities for the next step (by composing with a derangement), namely:$\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \{1, 3, 2, 4\}, \{1, 4, 3, 2\}, \{3, 2, 1, 4\},$ $\{3, 4, 2, 1\}, \{3, 4, 1, 2\}, \{4, 2, 3, 1\}, \{4, 3, 1, 2\},$ and $\{4, 3, 2, 1\}.$ If, instead, we had started with $\{1, 3, 4, 2\},$ then the possibilities would be $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $\{1, 4, 2, 3\}.$ See AoPS for the original discussion of this problem. It's not difficult to write a recursion for $E_n$ in terms of $E_{D_i},$ where $E_{D_i}$ is the expected number of steps given that we begin with precisely $(n-i)$ fixed points.

I have tried a few approaches, but as is often the case with viscosity theory, the devil is in the details and I cannot seem to write something convincing.

Attempt at a solution: We suppose the contrary, that at some point $x_0,$ we have $Au^{\epsilon}(x_0) > 0.$ By continuity, we can extend this further to strict positivity on some open neighborhood $N$ of $x_0.$ By upper semi-continuity, I know that $u-u^{\epsilon}$ will achieve a maximum on closure  $\overline{N}$. If it is a local maximum, that is great, I'm done. However, if it is not, I am looking to construct another test function, say $\psi$ such that $A\psi \geq 0$ and $u - u^{\epsilon} - \psi$ achieves a local maximum inside $N$.

Now I want to show that this generator is the generator in the sense of the weak topology on $C_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, i.e. that the convergence is bounded pointwise convergence. Let $u \in \mathcal{D}(A)$. Since (by definition) the sequence is pointwise convergent, the only remaining thing is to show the boundedness, i.e. $$\sup_{t>0} \left\| \frac{T_t u-u}{t} \right\|_{\infty} < \infty$$ Well, since the sequence is pointwise convergent we have $$\sup_{t > 0} \left|\frac{T_t u(x)-u(x)}{t} \right| < \infty$$ for fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

So I gave him an upper bound: $$8!~3^8\cdot24!~2^{24}/2^{12}\cdot12!~2^{12}\cdot24!/4!^6\cdot24!/4!^6,$$ did some rough approximation, and said it was around 10^79. Then I decided I'd try to give a lower bound, and came up dry. In the Wikipedia article , we read that: The orientation of the eighth vertex depends on the other seven. The 24 edge pieces that are next to vertices can't be flipped. The twelfth central edge's orientation depends on the other eleven. The parity of a permutation of the vertices and of the edge pieces are linked. The second point is easy to see by imagining the route that such an edge piece takes under all the various moves. (The Wikipedia article opts to give a mechanical reason instead, which is a questionable practice.) The other points are not too hard to see either. So we divide by $3\cdot2^{24}\cdot2\cdot2$ and get the answer, around $2.83\cdot10^{74}.$ My friend does not know group theory, and the only proof I know of the independence of the rest of the stuff uses group theory to a considerably greater extent than that which proves the dependent parts dependent.

This implies $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin\left(n\pi/2+k\theta_{n}\right)}{k^{n+1}}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n}}{2}\left(\frac{\pi\theta_{n}^{n}}{n!}-\frac{\theta_{n}^{n+1}}{\left(n+1\right)!}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{n+1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{n+i}\theta_{n}^{n+1-2i}\zeta\left(2i\right)}{(n+1-2i)!}$$ and, because I am interested in the case $n=2u$, this turns out to be $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin\left(u\pi+k\theta_{n}\right)}{k^{2u+1}}=\left(-1\right)^{u}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin\left(k\theta_{}\right)}{k^{2u+1}}\\=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\pi\theta_{2u}^{2u}}{(2u+1)!}-\frac{\theta_{2u}^{2u+1}}{\left(2u+1\right)!}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{2u+1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{i}\theta^{2u+1-2i}\zeta\left(2i\right)}{(2u+1-2i)!}$$ and, therefore $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin\left(k\theta_{}\right)}{k^{2u+1}}=\frac{\left(-1\right)^u}{2}\left(\frac{\pi\theta^{2u}}{(2u)!}-\frac{\theta^{2u+1}}{\left(2u+1\right)!}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{2u+1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{u+i}\theta^{2u+1-2i}\zeta\left(2i\right)}{(2u+1-2i)!}.$$ Now, some questions: how do I prove whether my conjecture is right? Is there any cool tricks I can use when dealing with multiple integrations like these? Is there another approach with this series? EDIT Maybe induction can help me.

280445,I need to know the formula to compute time to reach a star,"I am working on a sci-fy short story and I need to use a somewhat realistic value for the time in transit for going to a star.
Assume that energy on the space ship is not a problem.  The space ship accelerates at some amount of G-force until reaching some fraction of the speed-of-light.  It then coasts until reaching the midpoint and then reverses the procedure (including the coasting) until reaching the destination star. So what would be the formula to compute the time to the coast segment and distance covered? Assume G = .1, D = 50 light-years, Max-speed .5 of light-speed.
How do I compute D(s) - distance covered until coasting
T(s) - time taken to reach D(s) Added bonus; would there be any time dilatation at this speed and if so how to I compute it?",['algebra-precalculus']

280506,"Monthly rental fee to achieve given profit on average, given probabilities of numbers of rentals","I have this problem here and I'm very unsure of how to start this. I have an idea but I'm not sure where to go from a certain point. The problem says: A video rental store is analyzing a flat fee rental program it is planning to offer and the program allows a subscriber to rent up to $8$ movies a month for a flat monthly fee. Each rental costs the store $1.25$ dollars in processing and personnel fees. Let $p_n$ be the probability that a subscriber rents $n$ movies in one month. We have the following: $1)$ $p_0=a$ $2)$ $p_n-p_{n+1}=c\gt 0$ where $c$ is some constant for $n=0,1,...,7$ $3)$ The probability of a subscriber renting fewer than $3$ movies in one month is $0.55$ The store would like to make a profit of $1$ dollar per rental on average. What should the monthly fee be for the program to achieve this profit? My first instinct is to find the expected number of rentals per month and multiply it by $1.25$ to see how much it would cost. Then find the expected cost of this program and charge a dollar more than that. But I can't think of how to find the probability.

280546,"""The closure of the unit ball of $C^1[0, 1]$ in $C[0, 1]$"" and its compactness","[I really want to apologize if this problem looks a little too long.] The problem : This is taken from here [Question. 3.7 (c)] and it says... Prove or disprove the comapctness of the closure of the unit ball of $C^1[0, 1]$ in $C[0, 1]$. What have I tried? I think it's pretty clear that the unit ball in $C^1[0,1]$ is $B= \{f \in C^{1}[0,1]: \lVert f \rVert \leq 1\}$. Let us denote $K= \operatorname{cl}_{C[0,1]}(B)$, the closure of $B$ in $C[0,1]$. I really didn't have much clue how to start working on this problem but finally thought about using the sequential approach. If $a$ and $b$ are two points such that $0<a<b<1$ then I think there can be functions $f_a$ and $f_b$ having the property that $\lVert f_a-f_b \rVert = 1$ which are sufficiently smooth to be in $C^1$.  Now as it is quite tedious to construct these functions explicitly, I scanned a hand-drawn picture of what I think they might look like. Here $f_a$ and $f_b$ take zero values in almost all of the interval $[0,1]$ and jumps up at $a$ and $b$ respectively. Also, as is clear from the figure, they don't assume non-zero values simultaneously. Now, my argument is clear: however close the two points $a$ and $b$ come to each other (remaining distinct) there will always be functions like $f_a$ and $f_b$. They may get steeper and steeper but will never lose their $C^1$-ness. So if I consider the sequence $(\frac{1}{n})$ in $[0,1]$, I will get a sequence $(f_{\frac{1}{n}})$ in $B (\subseteq K)$ where for $m \neq n$ we will have $\lVert f_{\frac{1}{m}} - f_{\frac{1}{n}}\rVert = 1$. Hence the sequence $(f_{\frac{1}{n}})$ cannot have a convergent subsequence, thereby proving that $K$ is not sequentally compact and hence not compact. But I'm not very sure about all these. A friend of mine told me that this same problem has a positive answer and that made me sufficiently confused. So, here comes my question... In the above argument, where have I gone wrong?
  What is the real answer? And how to prove it? Thanks a million for reading my extra-long question. And thanks a zillion for any help that you can offer.","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series', 'metric-spaces']"
