2927763,Differential operators on a smooth mainifold,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. If I'm not wrong, the set of differential operators on $M$ is defined as $\mathcal{D}_M  $ can be defined by using vector fields. I.e. for each $D \in \mathcal{D}$ we have $D = X_1 \circ \dots \circ X_k$ for some smooth vector fields $X_1, \dots X_k$ . Is it correct to think about differential operators in this way? Moreover I was told that jets are the homomrphism from $\mathcal{D}$ to $C^\infty(M)$ . Can you give me an example of jet? My idea: take $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$ . Let's define $J_f$ as follows: for every $D \in \mathcal{D}$ $$
J_f(D) := D(f).
$$ This should be an homomorphism from $\mathcal{D}$ to $C^\infty(M)$ , right? Are all jets defined in this way?","['jet-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'modules', 'differential-geometry']"

2927823,Set difference between three sets,"I am trying to prove whether the following claim is true or false. Given sets $X, Y, Z$ , is the following equality of sets true or false. $$(X \setminus Y) \setminus Z = (X \setminus Z) \setminus Y $$ I believe the claim is true. My thinking is that the set on the LHS is simply all those elements of $X$ that are not in $Y$ and not in $Z$ . The set on the RHS is also all those elements of $X$ that are not in $Z$ and not in $Y$ . For example, if $X = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ , $Y = \{1,2,3\}$ and $Z = \{3,4\}$ then $(X \setminus Y) \setminus Z = \{5\}$ and $(X \setminus Z) \setminus Y = \{5\}$ as well.

2928117,Theorema Egregium and coeficcients of the second fundamental form,"The Theorema Egregium says that Gaussian curvature $K$ of a regular surface $S$ is invariant under local isometries.

This implies that $eg-f^2$ is invariant under local isometries as well. I am following the proof of Manfredo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces for the theorema Egregium, but the end of the proof seems less natural to me that the proof of the fact that Christoffel's symbols are invariant under local isometries. My question: Is there another way of proving the quantity $eg-f^2$ depends only on Christoffel's symbols and the coefficients of the fundamental form, thus it is also invariant under local isometries? Thank you in advance. EDIT : Maybe I should add the following, it is not hard to see that, if $\chi: U \to S$ is a local parametrization compatible with some orientation $N$ on $S$ then $$eg-f^2 = \langle \chi_{u,u},\chi_{v,v} \rangle - \langle \chi_{u,v},\chi_{u,v} \rangle  + \mathrm{Christoffel's ~symbols}$$ Therefore my question reduces to showing that $\langle \chi_{u,u},\chi_{v,v} \rangle - \langle \chi_{u,v},\chi_{u,v} \rangle$ can be expressed in terms of Christoffel's symbols and the coefficients of the first fundamental form.","['riemannian-geometry', 'surfaces', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2928177,A functional equation of a matrix,"How would one prove the following theorem? $p(A)$ is a nonzero polynomial of the entries of $A$ and satisfies $p(AB)=p(A)p(B)$ , for all square matrices $A$ and $B$ of complex numbers. Prove $p(A)=(\det\,A)^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$ . My attempt: A matrix $A$ can be Shur-decomposed  into $A=QTQ^\dagger$ where $T$ is a triangular matrix and $Q$ a unitary matrix. Now $p(Q)p(Q^\dagger)=p(QQ^\dagger)=p(I)=1$ where the last equation comes from the second paragraph below. Now $p(A)=p(Q)p(T)p(Q^\dagger)=p(T)$ . If we can show $p(T)=(\Pi_i\ T_{i,i})^k$ for some integer $k$ , then we are done. Now if $T$ is diagonal with its diagonal entries all equal to $1$ except one being a complex variable $x$ , we can show $p(T)=x^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$ . Let $p(T)=\sum_{i=0}^k a_ix^i$ for some nonnegative integer $k$ and $a_k\ne0$ . $\sum_{i=0}^k a_ix^{2i}=p(T^2)=p(T)^2=\big(\sum_{i=0}^k a_ix^i\big)^2$ .

Considering the coefficents of the terms of order no less than $k$ , we draw the following conclusion. The coefficients of the odd order terms have to be zero. $a_k=1$ . Recursively we conclude $a_i=0,\,\forall i<k$ . As $p(T_1T_2)=p(T_1)p(T_2)$ , $p(T)=\Pi_i\ T_{i,i}$ for any diagonal matrix $T$ .

2928263,Matrix Regression for linear ODE system,"Background I have the following homogeneous ODE system as an Initial Value Problem: $$
y'=A\cdot y\quad\wedge\quad y(0)=y_0
$$ where $y\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times 1}$ is the unknown vector and $A\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ is a known, constant coefficient nonsingular, diagonalizable matrix with only $N$ independent entries. For instance, if $N=3$ it could be: $$
A=\begin{pmatrix}
-x_1 & 0 & 0\\
x_1 & -x_2 & 0\\
0 & x_2 & -x_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$ with $x_1,x_2,x_3$ known. It is possible to express a closed form solution of this system as: $$
y(t)=\sum_{i=1}^NK_i e^{\lambda_it}\cdot u_i
$$ where $\lambda_i$ is the i-th eigenvalue of $A$ and $u_i$ is the i-th eigenvector of $A$ . The $K_i$ are constants of integration such that the Initial Condition is followed. Question Suppose to have the above ODE system, with the matrix $A$ with a known structure but the entries' values $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ are unknown. Suppose also to have $t_k$ and $y(t_k)=y_k$ values for $k$ ""experiments"" with $k\gg N$ , including the initial condition state, $k=0\to t_{k=0}=0$ . Is there a way to calculate such entries values by means of a regression? If so, what kind of regression? Also we assume that $y_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ . Above all, I think the answer to the first question being ""yes"" since the number of unknown parameters $N$ is way less than the number of experimental data $k$ . Edit 1 - The Brute Force Approach Since the eigenbasis of $A$ is invariant under uniform scaling, meaning that for any constant $K\neq 0$ if $u_i$ is an eigenvector of $A$ (with eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ ) then $w_i=Ku_i$ is also an eigenvector (with eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ ), since: $$
Au_i=\lambda_iu_i\quad\to\quad AKu_i=\lambda_iKu_i\quad\to\quad Aw_i=\lambda_iw_i
$$ the general solution can be rewritten as a model: $$
\hat{y}(t,\lambda,W)=\sum_{i=1}^N e^{\lambda_it}\cdot w_i
$$ or, by component: $$
y_j(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N e^{\lambda_it}\cdot w_{ji}
$$ This yields $N$ equations with a total of $N+N^2$ parameters ( $N$ eigenvalues and $N^2$ eigenvector components of the matrix $W=\{w\}_{ji}$ ) and thus $k\gg N(N+1)$ is required at least. The regression is expressed as a minimization problem: $$
\min_{\lambda, W}\sum_{j=1}^{k} \left\lvert y_{j} - \hat{y} (t_j,\lambda,W)\right\rvert_2
$$ and once $\lambda$ and $W$ are known, then: $$
A=W^{-1}\mathrm{diag}(\lambda)W
$$ This process is however tedious, boring, and does not exploit the structure and properties of A. What are the improvements?","['regression', 'parameter-estimation', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2928286,Explain carefully why the equation $3x=2$ has no solution in $\mathbb{Z}$.,"My proof is below, but I am not sure if this is ""carefully"" enough. I am sure there are many better proofs out there, but this is the one that came to my mind first. Does this work? Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $3x=2$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$ . This would then imply that $x$ is an element in $Z$ , the set of integers. We can calculate $x$ as follows: $3x=2\Rightarrow \frac{3x}{3}=\frac{2}{3}\Rightarrow x=\frac{2}{3}$ . Any integer can be written as the fraction $z=\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers and, importantly, $a=n\cdot b$ where $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ . This means the numerator must be a multiple of the denominator. There are infinitely many different possibilities for $a,b$ for any $z\in\mathbb{Z}$ . However, it is impossible for this to be true for $\frac{2}{3}$ as the numerator must be strictly less than the denominator. Therefore we have reached a contradiction and $3x=2$ can not have a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$ .","['analysis', 'real-analysis']"

To find $P(X_1 = 1)$ I will condition on the event $A =$ the husband is at a table with $4$ seats and the event $B =$ the husband is at a table with $2$ seats. $$P(X_1 = 1) = P(X_1 = 1 \mid A)P(A) + P(X_1 = 1 \mid B)P(B)$$ $$=\frac{3}{19}\frac{12}{20}+\frac{1}{19}\frac{8}{20} \approx .1157$$ and so $E[X] \approx 1.157$ which does not match the book solution of $2.48$ .

With this topology, $\amalg_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}$ is called a disjoint union space . In this definition, what does it mean for a set to be open in $X_{\alpha}$ ? Here the disjoint union $\amalg_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}$ is defined by $$\amalg_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}=\{(x,\alpha):\alpha\in A, x\in X_{\alpha}\},$$ and by ""considered as a subset of the disjoint union"", he means that he is identifying the set $X_{\alpha}$ with the set $$\{(x,\alpha): x\in X_{\alpha}\}.$$",['general-topology']

But, am  still not sure about disproving surjectivity. My approach is not based on calculus (that am still unable to understand, as stated on mse here ); but is based on disproof by taking cases where failure occurs. The minimum value taken up by $f\circ g = x^2 +8x +14$ is $14$ . Similarly, the minimum value taken up by $g\circ f = x^2 +2$ is $2$ . Hence, the entire range is not mapped.

2928624,Possible discrepancy between two forms of the derivative of $|x|^{3/2}$?,"I've come across what seems to be a discrepancy between two different ways of representing the derivative of the function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=|x|^{3/2}$ . I started by using the definition of the absolute value function: $$
f(x) = |x|^{3/2} =
\begin{cases}
x^{3/2}, & x\geq 0 \\
(-x)^{3/2}, & x<0 \\
\end{cases}.
$$ Then using the chain rule, we have $$
f'(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}, & x>0 \\
-\frac{3}{2}(-x)^{1/2}, & x<0 \\
\end{cases}.
$$ Based on the graph of the function, it seemed reasonable to check if the derivative existed at zero. Thus I made the following computations: \begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
f_+'(0)&=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{h^{3/2}}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0^+}h^{1/2}=0 \\
f_-'(0)&=\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{(-h)^{3/2}}{h}=-\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{(-h)^{3/2}}{(-h)}=-\lim_{h\to 0^-}(-h)^{1/2}=0.
\end{split}
\end{equation*} From this, it seems that the derivative exists at $x=0$ and that $f'(0)=0$ . However, if we find the derivative using the chain rule and the fact that we can write the derivative of the absolute value function as $$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\,|x|\,\right ]=\frac{x}{|x|},
$$ we obtain $$
f'(x)=\frac{3}{2}|x|^{1/2}\cdot \frac{x}{|x|} = \frac{3x}{2\sqrt{|x|}},
$$ which should be undefined at $x=0$ . So the question is, should the derivative be defined at $0$ or should it not? If so, is this just an issue with the notation we use for the derivative of the absolute value function or a sign error or something?

We're working strictly with a single card issuer who's range of first six digits is between 222100-272099 or 510000-559999. For simplicity this allows for 100,000 possible combinations. Last four:
These for simplicity can be assumed to be completely random. (ignoring Luhn checks) Expiry date:
Only valid future dates within a four year time frame. What's the probability of 2 cards in the entire population being the same? So far our best theory by breaking this down into parts is: A = There are 100,000 combinations of the first 6 digits. B = There are 10,000 combinations of the last 4 digits C = There are 48 combinations of the date field. We are looking for the number of clashes in the population. For simplicity we've assumed a population of 1 billion. So we are assuming ultimately that there will be 1 billion events and are looking for the probability of getting 2 identical outcomes from those events: A * B * C = 1,000,000,000x
1/100,000 * 1/10,000 * 1/48 = 1,000,000,000x

Hall then mentions: ""should $\hat\theta$ be $\sqrt{n}$ -consistent for $\theta_0$ , so that $E(\hat\theta-\theta_0)^2=O(n^{-1})$ ..."" Why is this true? Could you please in particular provide a rigorous argument (you can make further assumptions if necessary)? My interest in this study is to see how such an argument can be constructed. My progress so far is that I understand the claim intuitively, as follows: the $\sqrt{n}$ -consistency of $\hat\theta$ means there is some fixed positive number $V$ such that $$
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta-\theta_0)\approx N(0,V)\implies E[(\hat\theta-\theta_0)^2]\approx\frac{1}{n}V=O(n^{-1}).

I said the following: there are ${7\choose3} = 35$ ways to pick places for the girls, and in $5$ of those ways, the girls will be completely apart (i.e. no two girls sit together), giving a probability of $\frac{5}{35} = \frac{1}{7}$ . Thus the probability that at least two girls sit together is $1-\frac{1}{7} = \frac{6}{7}$ . The probability that all three girls sit together is $\frac{7}{35} = \frac{1}{5}$ , since there are $7$ ways to pick the three places such that all three girls sit together. Hence, the probability that exactly two girls sit together is $\frac{6}{7} - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{23}{35}$ .

2929919,The order of $Hg\in G/H$ divides the order of $g\in G$ when $H$ is normal in $G$ and $G$ is finite.,"Proposition: The order of $Hg\in G/H$ divides the order of $g\in G$ when $H$ is normal in $G$ and $G$ is finite. Proof Attempt(by contradiction): Let $H \lhd G$ and $gH\in G/H$ where the order of $gH$ is $k$ in $G$ . Thus, $(gH)^k=g^kH=H \Leftrightarrow g^k\in H$ and $\forall j \lt k, (gH)^j=g^jH \neq H$ which implies $g^j \notin H$ . Suppose $\vert g\vert=n$ such that $g\in G$ so that $g^n=e \in H$ and $\forall m \lt n, g^n\neq e$ . By the division algorithm $\exists q,r\in \Bbb{Z}$ such that $n=kq+r$ where $0\leq r \lt q,k,n$ . Hence, if $r\gt 0$ , $g^r\neq e$ and $g^n=g^{kq+r}=g^{kq}g^r=e\Rightarrow g^r=g^{-kq}$ . Since $g^k \in H$ , then $g^{-kq}=g^r \in H$ . But, $r<k$ so $g^r \notin H$ unless $r=0$ . So $r$ must be $0$ and that means $n=kq$ and $k$ divides $n$ , as desired.","['group-theory', 'proof-verification', 'finite-groups']"

2929983,What does it really mean for a Lagrangian to be independent of the base coordinates?,"In this question I will be considering what is called in physics a ""classical Lagrangian field theory"" from a geometric point of view. One is given an $n$ dimensional (smooth, real) ""spacetime manifold"" $M$ , with some ""field"" $\psi$ on it. From a purely local point of view, the field is assumed to have components $\psi^i(x)$ . A (first-order) Lagrangian is then an $n$ -form $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n $$ that depends on the field, the field derivatives and maybe on the spacetime coordinates explicitly. In physics, it is considered pathological for a Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the spacetime coordinates. Usually it signals a ""nonclosed"" system, where there are externally imposed fields, whose dynamics are not controlled by a Lagrangian. From a more precise point of view, let $E\rightarrow M$ be a rank $k$ vector bundle over $M$ (it can be a general fiber bundle, and in fact, it is often not a vector bundle, but even in those cases, one can often consider it a vector bundle - for example the bundle of metrics, which is nonlinear may be enlarged to the bundle of symmetric (0,2) tensors, which is). The field $\psi$ is considered a section of $E$ . In a local trivialization $E$ has coordinates $(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\})$ . We can consider the first jet bundle $J^1E$ of (sections of) $E$ , whose local coordinates are $(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\})$ . If $\psi$ is a section of $E$ , it ""looks like"" in local coordinates as $$\psi: x\mapsto (\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\}), $$ and its first jet prolongation $j^1\psi$ looks like as $$ j^1\psi:x\mapsto (\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\}).$$ The (first-order) Lagrangian is then a horizontal $n$ -form on $J^1E$ , which in a local trivialization looks like as $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n $$ where the $dx^\mu$ are considered 1-forms on $J^1E$ . The fields are not involved here, however, the action functional is defined as $$ S[\psi]=\int (j^1\psi)^\ast\hat L, $$ where $$(j^1\psi)^*\hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n.$$ The problem: It is a well known fact that if $E\rightarrow M$ is some fiber bundle (like the $E$ previously defined, or $J^1E$ ), then if $f:E\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is some smooth function (the target space of this map is not really relevant), and in some local trivialization this function looks like as $$ f(\{y^i\}), $$ eg. $f$ doesn't depend on the base coordinates $x^\mu$ , then this is not a trivialization-independent statement. In some other trivialization, it will look like as $$ f^\prime(\{x^{\prime\mu}\},\{y^{\prime i}\}). $$ On the other hand, as I have stated in the beginning of the question, in physics it is considered pathological to have a Lagrangian that depends explicitly on $x^\mu$ . However by the previous argument, it should not be possible to construct a Lagrangian on $J^1E$ , that looks like $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\}) $$ in all trivializations. Now, I know that in physics, there is often a lot of background structure assumed. These background structures can break ""general covariance"". I can illustrate this with the following example: For the massless Klein-Gordon field in Minkowski-spacetime, the Lagrangian (in physics language - so this is already pulled back via the field's prolongation) is $$ \mathcal L=\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\psi\partial_\nu\psi\ dx^1\wedge...dx^n, $$ where $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ is the canonical ""flat"" form of the dual Lorentz-metric. It is not explicitly $x$ -dependent, but this is not a trivialization-independent statement. If we perform a non-PoincarÃ© coordinate transformation, the Lagrangian will look like $$ \mathcal L=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}(x)\partial_\mu\psi\partial_\nu\psi\sqrt{|\det g(x)|}dx^1\wedge...dx^n. $$ Here the general form of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is $x$ -dependent, but is an externally imposed field, so the Lagrangian is $x$ -dependent. However, in physics, if we account for everything, then we can get rid of all background structures. For example, we can consider the gravitational field (the metric) $g$ , a matter field $\psi$ (a Dirac field, or a scalar multiplet), and a gauge connection $A$ , and mesh everything into a glorious Lagrangian $$ \mathcal L(\psi,\partial\psi,A,\partial A,g,\partial g,\partial\partial g) $$ (this Lagrangian will be second order in $g$ , but that doesn't change the problem). Now, this Lagrangian will never acquire explicit $x$ -dependence, through either diffeomorphisms of $M$ , or changes of trivialization in $E$ (here $\psi$ is a section of $E$ , and $E$ is considered a $G$ -bundle for some Lie group $G$ , and $A$ is a $G$ -connection) or for that matter, in the ""connection bundle"" in which $A$ lives. So from this, it seems to me that if we use fiber products to create one massive fiber bundle $\mathcal E$ from all these bundles involved, then the unified Lagrangian is still a horizontal element in $\Omega^n(J^1\mathcal E)$ , yet it will never acquire explicit $x$ -dependence. Question: Considering all the lengthy exposition I have given above, how do you invariantly and geometrically characterize Lagrangians which do not depend explicitly on the base manifold's coordinates? Since this should be a trivialization-dependent statement, yet it also seems to be that it is possible to construct Lagrangians that absolutely do not depend on any background structures, and are as such $x$ -independent.","['calculus-of-variations', 'fiber-bundles', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'jet-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

$$ And that result doesn't match the answer in the book. However if I assume that the solution for non-homogenous part is in the form $B$ , then $C_1 = -{2\over 3}$ and $C_2 = {2 \over 3}$ , which by the steps above results in: $$
x_n = {1\over 3} \cdot (2^{n+1} - 2\cdot(-1)^n) - 1
$$ being a match with the answer from the book. I'm trying to understand where it got wrong and why the answers are different. I could have assumed non-homogenous solution to be in various forms which I believe would still lead to some form of solution. Have I made a mistake in my first assumption?","['algebra-precalculus', 'recurrence-relations']"

2930420,Why did the authors use $\prec$ instead of $\preccurlyeq$ in the definitions of $S_c$ and $S_{c^\ast}$?,"Recently, I have read the proof of theorem 5.3 from textbook Introduction to Set Theory by Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech. I would like to know why the authors didn't define $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ or $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \prec^\ast c^\ast\}$ . I think that $S_c$ would not necessarily equal to $S_{c^\ast}$ as mentioned in the last line if the authors defined as I mentioned. 5.3 Theorem Let $(P, <)$ be a dense linearly ordered set without endpoints. Then there exists a complete linearly ordered set $(C,\prec)$ such that (a) $P\subseteq C$ . (b) If $p,q\in P$ then $p < q$ if and only if $p \prec q$ ( $<$ coincides with $\prec$ on $P$ ). (c) $P$ is dense in $C$ , i.e., for any $a,b\in C$ such that $a\prec b$ , there is $p\in P$ with $a\prec p \prec b$ . (d) $C$ does not have endpoints. Moreover, this complete linearly ordered set $(C,\prec)$ is unique up to isomorphism over $P$ . In other words, if $(C^\ast,\prec^\ast)$ is a complete linearly ordered set which satisfies (a)-(d), then there is an isomorphism $h$ between $(C,\prec)$ and $(C^\ast,\prec^\ast)$ such that $h(x) = x$ for each $x \in P$ . The linearly ordered set $(C,\prec)$ is called the completion of $(P, <)$ . As is usual in theorems of this type, the uniqueness part of the theorem is
  easier to prove. For that reason, we do it first. Proof of Uniqueness of Completion. Let $(C,\prec)$ and $(C^\ast,\prec^\ast)$ be two complete linearly ordered sets satisfying (a)-(d). We show that there is an isomorphism $h$ of $C$ onto $C^\ast$ such that $h(x)=x$ for each $x\in P$ . If $c\in C$ , let $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \preccurlyeq  c\}$ . Similarly, let $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p\preccurlyeq^\ast c^\ast\}$ for $c^\ast\in C^\ast$ . If $S$ is a nonempty subset of $P$ bounded from above, let $\sup S$ be the supremum of $S$ in $(C,\prec)$ and $\sup^\ast S$ be the supremum of $S$ in $(C^\ast,\prec^\ast)$ . Notice that $\sup S_c=c$ , $\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}=c^\ast$ . We define the mapping $h$ as follows: $h(c)=\sup^\ast S_c$ . Clearl, $h$ is a mapping of $C$ into $C^\ast$ ; we have to show that the mapping is onto and that (a) If $c\prec d$ , then $h(c)\prec^\ast h(d)$ . (b) $h(x)=x$ for each $x\in P$ . To show that $h$ is onto, let $c^\ast\in C^\ast$ be arbitrary. Then $c^\ast=\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}$ , and if we let $c=\sup S_{c^\ast}$ , then $S_c=S_{c^\ast}$ and $c^\ast=h(c)$ . Below is the reasoning for my conclusion. Could you please have a check on my it? I would like to verify that $\sup S_c=c$ and $\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}=c^\ast$ . Since $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \preccurlyeq c\}$ , $\sup S_c\preccurlyeq c$ . If $\sup S_c\prec c$ , then there exists $p\in P$ such that $\sup S_c\prec p \prec c$ . Thus $p\in S_c$ and $\sup S_c\prec p$ . This is clearly a contradiction. Hence $\sup S_c= c$ . Similarly, we can prove that $\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}=c^\ast$ . If we change the definition of $S_c$ to $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ and that of $S_{c^\ast}$ to $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \prec^\ast c^\ast\}$ , we still have $\sup S_c=c$ and $\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}=c^\ast$ . Since $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ , $\sup S_c\preccurlyeq c$ . If $\sup S_c\prec c$ , then there exists $p\in P$ such that $\sup S_c\prec p \prec c$ . Thus $p\in S_c$ and $\sup S_c\prec p$ . This is clearly a contradiction. Hence $\sup S_c= c$ . Similarly, we can prove that $\sup^\ast S_{c^\ast}=c^\ast$ . I would like to verify that $S_c=S_{c^\ast}$ as mentioned in the last line. For $c^\ast \in C^\ast$ , $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \preccurlyeq^\ast c^\ast\}$ . Let $c=\sup S_{c^\ast}$ , then $c\in C$ . We have $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \preccurlyeq c\}$ . Notice that $S_{c^\ast} \subseteq P$ and $S_c \subseteq P$ . For any $p\in S_c$ , $p \preccurlyeq c$ and thus $p \preccurlyeq \sup S_{c^\ast}$ . Then $p \preccurlyeq p'$ for some $p' \in S_{c^\ast}$ . If not, $p' \prec p$ for all $p' \in S_{c^\ast}$ and thus $p' \prec p \preccurlyeq \sup S_{c^\ast}$ for all $p' \in S_{c^\ast}$ . Then $p=\sup S_{c^\ast}$ and thus $S_c$ has only one element. This clearly contradicts the fact that $P$ does not have a least element. Hence $p \preccurlyeq p'\preccurlyeq^\ast c^\ast$ for some $p' \in S_{c^\ast}$ and consequently $p \preccurlyeq^\ast c^\ast$ . Thus $p\in S_{c^\ast}$ . To sum up, $p\in S_c \implies p\in S_{c^\ast}$ and thus $S_c\subseteq S_{c^\ast}$ . For any $p\in S_{c^\ast}$ , $p \preccurlyeq \sup S_{c^\ast}$ and thus $p \preccurlyeq c$ . Then $p\in S_c$ . Hence $S_{c^\ast} \subseteq S_c$ . As a result, $S_{c^\ast}=S_{c^\ast}$ . I'm quite curious about why the authors didn't define $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ or $S_{c^\ast}$ to $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \prec^\ast c^\ast\}$ . I think that $S_c$ would not necessarily equal to $S_{c^\ast}$ as mentioned in the last line if the authors defined as such. For example, we instead define $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ and keep $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \preccurlyeq^\ast c^\ast\}$ . I found that the first reasoning in 3. is still applicable here. Thus $S_c\subseteq S_{c^\ast}$ . But the second reasoning falls apart because: $p \preccurlyeq \sup S_{c^\ast}=c$ , but $p$ is not necessarily strictly less than $c$ . Hence $p$ does not necessarily belong to $S_c$ and consequently $S_{c^\ast}$ is not necessarily a subset of $S_c$ . To sum up, $S_{c^\ast}$ is not necessarily equal to $S_c$ . Similarly, we instead define $S_c=\{p\in P\mid p \prec c\}$ and $S_{c^\ast}=\{p\in P\mid p \prec^\ast c^\ast\}$ . Then $S_{c^\ast}$ is not necessarily equal to $S_c$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-explanation']"
2930438,"Find integral of $\operatorname{sinc}(\pi x)$ over range $x=[0,1]$","I want to find the area under a normalised $\operatorname{sinc}$ curve raised to the power of $2 k$ over the range $x=[0,1]$ where $k$ is a non-negative integer. In other words: $$\int_0^1 \operatorname{sinc}^{2k}(\pi x) dx$$ It is well-established that $\int_0^\infty \operatorname{sinc}(\pi x) dx=\frac{1}{2}$ . But I can't figure out how to take a definite integral within this more limited range, and with $\operatorname{sinc}$ raised to power $2k$ that I can then plug any chosen value of $k$ into. (I can use Mathematica to find integrals for a few specific values of $k$ , but I can't find a general solution.) Note that I don't really understand Fourier analysis, sorry. And things are likely to get hairy if I try to plug in a complex exponent because the definition that distinguishes $\operatorname{sinc}(\pi x)$ from $\frac{\sin (\pi x)}{\pi x}$ would be lost. Is it possible to create this general definite integral? How? EDIT: Also, what happens in the limit as $k \rightarrow\infty$ ? Presumably the value of the integral tends to $0$ ... Perhaps that's why there's no general expression for it?","['integration', 'trigonometry', 'definite-integrals']"
2930446,Countably additive finite signed measures form a Banach Space.,"I'm currently studying some topics in measure theory and I am not sure how to prove the following: Let $X$ a set, $\mathcal A$ a $\sigma$ -algebra on X. Consider the set: $$ca(\mathcal A) = \{\mu:\mathcal A \to \mathbb R|\; \mu \; \text{is a
 finite signed measure} \}$$ Note that $ca(\mathcal A)$ is a subspace of $l_\infty(\mathcal A)$ . I
  want to prove the following: $\|\mu\|\stackrel{def}{=} |\mu|(X)$ defines a norm on $ca(\mathcal A)$ ; $(ca(\mathcal A), \| \cdot \|)$ is a Banach Space The following inequality holds: $$\|\mu\|_\infty \leq \|\mu\| \leq 2\|\mu\|_\infty,$$ where $\|\mu\|_\infty\stackrel{def}{=}
 \sup\limits_{A\in \mathcal A} |\mu(A)|$ I was able to prove (1) using Hahn-Jordan decomposition and the inequality on (3) is straightforward. Although I could not prove (2). What I tried: If $(\mu_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is Cauchy sequence on $ca(\mathcal A)$ , it follows from (3) that $(\mu_n)$ is point-wise convergent to $\nu\stackrel{def}{=} \lim \mu_n$ : Given $\varepsilon >0$ , there is $n_0 \geq 1$ such that: $$m>n \geq n_0 \implies \|(\mu_m - \mu_n)\|_\infty\leq \|\mu_m - \mu_n\| <\varepsilon.$$ Hence, for all $A\in \mathcal A$ , $(\mu_n(A))$ is convergent and $\nu$ is well defined. I am not sure how to prove that $\nu$ is a signed measure in $ca(\mathcal A)$ : $\nu(\emptyset)=\lim\mu_n(\emptyset) = 0$ ; Since $(\mu_n(X))$ is convergent sequence on $\mathbb R$ , it is bounded. So $\nu(X) = \lim \mu_n(X)$ is finite. Why, given a family $(A_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}\subset \mathcal A$ of disjoint sets, we have: $$\nu (\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\nu(A_i)$$ EDIT: I had an idea: Given a family $(A_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}\subset \mathcal A$ of disjoint sets, define $B_i = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^i A_j$ . The family of $(B_i)$ is increasing, $\cup B_i = \cup A_i$ , and: \begin{align*} 
\nu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) &=  \nu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i) \\ 
 &=  \lim_{i} \nu(B_i)\\
&= \lim_{i} \lim_{n} \mu_n (\bigcup_{j=1}^i A_j)\\
&= \lim_{i} \lim_{n} \sum_{j=1}^i \mu_n(A_j)\\
&= \lim_{i} \sum_{j=1}^i \lim_{n} \mu_n(A_j) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu(A_i).
\end{align*} Can anyone check if this is correct? EDIT2: I forgot to check the convergence $\mu_n \stackrel{\|\cdot\|}{\to}\nu$ and I struggling with it.","['measure-theory', 'signed-measures', 'functional-analysis']"
