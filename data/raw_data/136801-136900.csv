2176849,A method to count the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 2 or 3 or 4 in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$,"$p$ is a prime number.
I use the method as following to find out the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 2. Count the number of monic not irreducible polynomials of degree 2: If a monic polynomial $f(x)\in \mathbb F_{p}$ is of degree 2 and not irreducible, $f(x)=(x-\alpha)g(x)$ for some $g(x) \in \mathbb F_{p}$. As   $deg(g)=2-deg(x-\alpha)=2-1=1$.So $g=x-\beta$ for some $\beta \in \mathbb F$. Thus all the not irreducible monic polynomial of degree $2$ is of the form $f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$. If $\alpha =\beta$ $f(x)=(x-\alpha)^2$. We have $p$ polynomials $f(x)$ in this form. If $\alpha \neq \beta$ , we have ${p \choose 2}=\frac{p!}{2!(p-2)!}=\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ polynomials $f(x)$ in this form. Hence, the total number of monic not irreducible polynomials of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ is $p+\frac{p(p-1)}{2}=\frac{p(p+1)}{2}$ Monic polynomial of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ has the form $x^2+ax+b$ with $a,b \in\mathbb F_{p}[x]$. Thus we have $p^2$ such polymials. Thus the number of irreducible polynomial of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ is $p^2-\frac{p(p+1)}{2}=\frac{p^2-p}{2}$ But when I turn to find out the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 3. I find that all the not irreducible monic polynomial of degree $2$ is of the form $f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x^2+cx+d)$,so it seems that we have $p$ choices of $\alpha$,  $p$ choices of $c$ and $p$ choices of $d$, thus we have $p^3$ not irreducible polynomials of degree $3$ in $ \mathbb F_{p}$. But monic polynomial of degree $3$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ has the form $x^3+a_{1}x^2+a_{2}x+a_{3}$ with $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3} \in\mathbb F_{p}[x]$. Thus we have $p^3$ such monoc polymials. So I think  my counting when I try degree 3 is wrong. I use the method as following to find out the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 4. By using counting argument I have found that the number of irreducible polynomial of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ is $p^2-\frac{p(p+1)}{2}=\frac{p^2-p}{2}$. And we have $p^3-\frac{2p^3+p}{3}=\frac{p^3-p}{3}$ monic irreducible polynomials of degree $3$. EDIT: Now I am doing the case of degree 4, could someone please have a look to my counting to see if it is correct? Thanks so much! Monic polynomials of degree $4$ is of the form $x^4+a_{1}x^3+a_{2}x^2+a_{3}x+a_{4}$ where$a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4}$. Thus we have $p^4$ of them. Let $f(x)$ be a not irreducible monic polynomials of degree $4$, then there are several possible form of $f(x)$ (i):$f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)(x-\gamma)(x-\delta)$ with $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta \in \mathbb F_{p}$. (ii):$f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)(x^2+ax+b)$ with $\alpha,\beta,a,b \in \mathbb F_{p}$ and $(x^2+ax+b)$ is a irreducible polynomial of degree $2$. (iii)$f(x)=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$ with $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb F_{p}$ and $(x^2+ax+b), (x^2+cx+d)$ are irreducible polynomials of degree $2$. (iv)$f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x^3+ax^2+bx+c)$ with $\alpha,a,b,c \in \mathbb F_{p}$ and $(x^3+ax^2+bx+c)$ is a irreducible polynomial of degree $3$.
We have $p+3{p \choose 2}+3{p \choose 3}+{p \choose 4}$ monic reducible polynomials of degree $4$ of form (i).
$(p+{p \choose 2})\frac{p^2-p}{2}$  monic reducible polynomials of degree $4$ of form (ii).
$\frac{p^2-p}{2}+{\frac{p^2-p}{2} \choose 2}$  monic reducible polynomials of degree $4$ of form (iii).
and $p(\frac{p^3-p}{3})$ monic reducible polynomials of degree $4$ of form (iv). But the wolfram alpha does not give me the desire number of number of irreducible polynomials of degree 4. So I guess something is wrong. Could someone help me to find out what is wrong here and show the correct way?

2177215,Asymptotic probability that two binomial variables are equal,"$X_1,\ldots,X_k$ are independent random variables distributed like $\text{Binomial}[n,p]$. What is the probability that they are all equal, as a function of $k$ $p$ and $n$, when $n$ is very large? Currently I have two solutions. Solution A is general but quite informal. When $n$ is large, a Binomial random variable behaves like a normal random variable, and most of its probability mass is concentrated in the interval $\mu \pm \sigma$, where $\mu$ is the mean value and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. So we can approximate the variables as being drawn independently at random from a set with $2\sigma$ elements. After the first variable is determined, each of the remaining $k-1$ variables has probability $\approx 1/(2\sigma)$ to have the same value, so the probability that all are equal is $\approx 1/(2\sigma)^{k-1}$.  Here $\sigma=\sqrt{p (1-p) n}$, so the probability is: $${1 \over (4 p (1-p) n)^{(k-1)/2}} $$ Solution B is more formal but works only for $p=1/2$ and $k=2$ variables. Define $Y_2 := n - X_2$. So the event $X_1=X_2$ is identical to the event $X_1+Y_2 = n$. $Y_2$ is distributed like $\text{Binomial}[n,1-p]$, but here $p=1-p$ so it is distributed like $X_1$. Therefore $X_1+Y_2$ is distributed like $\text{Binomial}[2n,1/2]$ and the probability that it equals $n$ is just:  ${2n\choose n}2^{-2n}$. By Stirling's approximation , the binomial coefficient is $\approx {4^n \over \sqrt{\pi n}}$, so the probability that $X_1=X_2$ is approximately: $$ {1\over \sqrt{\pi n}}$$ This is a constant times the outcome of Solution A, which means that both solutions are at least asymptotically correct. What is a solution that works for every $p$ and $k$? EDIT: See also: What is the probability that two univariate Gaussian random variables are equal?",['probability']

2177497,Equivalence of two definitions of modular forms,"I am a theoretical computer science student, so have only a limited background in complex geometry. As part of my study on Ramanujan graphs, I came across modular forms. As I understand it, there are different ways to approach and define a modular form $f$ of weight $k$:
1)  A holomorphic function $f:\mathbf{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ that is also holomorphic at the limit $i \infty$ and satisfies a function equation
$$f\left( \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \right)= (cz+d)^k f(z)$$
for every
$$\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\c & d
\end{pmatrix} \in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$$ 2) A complex-valued function $f$ on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{C}$ defined as follows: for a lattice $\Lambda=<1,z>$, $f(\Lambda)=f(z)$ is an analytic function of $z$, and for an equivalent lattice $\alpha \Lambda$,
$$f(\alpha \Lambda)=\alpha^{-k}f(\Lambda)$$ So on the one hand, a modular form is a function defined on the upper half plane $\mathbf{H}$ that is ""well-behaved"" with respect to the action of the modular group $\Gamma$. On the other hand, a modular form is a function on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{C}$ whose ""growth"" is prescribed.
I am trying to see how to relate the two definitions and intuitively understand their equivalence. The first definition tells us that given $f(z)$, the values taken by $f$ on the orbit of $z$ under the action of $\Gamma$ is fully known. So if this orbit is a lattice in $\mathbf{H}$ (which can then be extended to a lattice in $\mathbb{C}$), then we would find some common ground between the two definitions. So my questions are:
1) Is the orbit of $z \in \mathbf{H}$ under the action of $\Gamma$ a lattice in $\mathbb{C}$? If so, do we have a simple expression for a basis of this lattice? 2) Conversely, can every lattice in $\mathbb{C}$ be expressed (or at least equivalent to) as the orbit of some element of $\mathbf{H}$ under the action of $\Gamma$ ? I apologize if these questions are trivial, but most references on these topics seem to require too many prerequisites and are way too rigorous to be of much immediate help.

(After doing this, I can use Rolle's Theorem to show that there is only 1 root). I will encounter the same problem for $m\ge\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ But the greatest problem I have now is what values of $x$ do I substitute into $f(x)$ for $-\frac{\sqrt3}{2}<m\le-\frac34$ and $\frac34\le m<\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ to show that there is at least 1 solution and at most 3 solutions?

Find the joint density function of $XY$ and $Z^2$, and show that $P(XY < Z^2) = \frac{5}{9}$. I'm not clever with these types of problems, so I just stick with the change of variables, but I don't know if I'm preparing the right statements to evaluate $P(XY < Z^2)$ (as the second part of the problem is clearly just a self-test): Let $u = xy, v = x, w = z^2 \implies t_1(v) = v, t_2(u,v) = \frac{u}{v}, t_3(w) = \sqrt{w}$.

   f_{U, V, W} (u, v, w) = f(t_1(v), t_2(u,v), t_3(w))|J(v,w)|
   \end{equation} (in the domain of the variables) \begin{equation}
   f_{U, W} (u, w) = f(x, \frac{u}{x}, \sqrt{w}) \left| \frac{1}{2x\sqrt{w}}\right|

2177916,Different proof that $\overline{A\cup B}\subset \overline{A}\cup \overline{B}$,"As Paul Erdos once said, first find a proof that works, and then go looking for the beautiful proof. Before looking at the proof my textbook gives for $\overline{A\cup B}\subset \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$, I attempted something myself. What I did is nothing like the proof given in the text, and might be needlessly complicated, but I wanted to check that it still works. I don't always trust my judgment that the mathematical logic is correct, so sometimes an extra set of eyes is useful. First, perhaps I should define $\overline{A}$. It is the set of adherence points of the set $A\subset X$ meaning it is the set of all points $x\in X$ such that any neighborhood of $x$ also contains points of $A$. Now, here is my proof: Suppose $x\notin \overline{A}\cup \overline{B}$. Then, $x\notin \overline{A}$ and $x\notin \overline{B}$. $x\notin \overline{A}$ implies that $\exists$ neighborhood $U(x)$ such that $x \in U(x)$ and $U(x) \cap A =\emptyset$, which implies that $x\in A^{c}$. Likewise, $x\notin \overline{B}$ means that $\exists$ a neighborhood $W(x)$ such that $x\in W(x)$ and $W(x)\cap B = \emptyset$. This implies that $x\in B^{c}$. So, $x\in A^{c}$ and $x\in B^{c}$, which means that $x \in A^{c}\cap B^{c}\subset\overline{A^{c}\cap B^{c}}\, \implies \, x\notin \overline{A\cup B}$ So, I showed that $x\notin \overline{A}\cup \overline{B}\, \implies \, x\notin \overline{A \cup B}$, which is the contrapositive of $x\in \overline{A \cup B}\, \implies \, x\in \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$, at least I think it is.

Let $X$ be a (real) Banach space and denote by $\ell_\infty(\Gamma,X)$ the Banach space of all bounded functions $f : \Gamma \to X$, equipped with the supremum norm.

I'm having trouble with the following argument: If $(\lambda_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is not relatively weakly compact, then we may assume that there exist disjoint subsets $(A_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of $\Gamma$ and $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $|\lambda_n(A_n)| > \varepsilon$ for all $n \geq 1$.

2178037,Does Euclidean geometry require a complete metric space?,"Note: I'm not sure how to tag this question so please fix tags as appropriate and necessary. This question relates to Tarski's axioms of Euclidean geometry, not Hilbert's axioms. It says on the same page (Theorem 3.1 -- see also this related question on Math.SE ) that: For every model of Euclidean Plane Geometry (using Tarski's axioms) there is a real closed field $R$ such that $M \cong R \times R$ as models. From what I gather from nLab's page on real closed fields , these are strictly more general than the real numbers, for example the real algebraic numbers is also a real closed field. However, the real algebraic numbers are not metrically complete . (I think.) In other words, not every Cauchy sequence converges. Question: How can a real closed field, which is not metrically complete, serve as a model for Euclidean plane geometry? In particular, how can the real algebraic numbers serve as a model for Euclidean geometry? For example, such a field cannot express the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter in Euclidean plane geometry since $\pi$ is transcendental and thus only contained in the metric completion of the rational numbers, but not the (real) algebraic completion. One of Tarski's axioms is described on the nLab page as being a ""Dedekind cut axiom expressed in first order terms"". If I remember real analysis correctly, Dedekind cuts allow one to construct the metric completion of the rational numbers (the real numbers). So if one of Tarski's axioms implies metric completeness (does it not? if not, why doesn't it?), then how can the real algebraic numbers, which aren't metrically complete (I think) serve as a model? I'm not sure if the Cantor-Dedekind axiom is one of Tarski's axioms or the same as the aforementioned ""Dedekind cut axiom"". If Tarski's axioms don't require a metrically complete space, then is the Cantor-Dedekind axiom not generally valid for models of Tarski's axioms? The answers to this related question seem to suggest that $\mathbb{Q}$ is insufficient for Euclidean geometry, which makes sense since $\mathbb{Q}$ is not real closed. However, it is unclear from the answers given if the problems with $\mathbb{Q}$ arise only because of the non-existence of algebraic irrational numbers (e.g. $\sqrt{2}$ ) or also because of the non-existence of transcendental irrational numbers, $\pi$ . The latter would imply that the real algebraic numbers are also insufficient for Euclidean geometry. Also, one of the axioms given for Euclidean plane geometry (on p. 171, M.2) in Agricola, Friedrich's Elementary Geometry is that the plane is a complete metric space. I had assumed that these axioms were just a (possibly less rigorous) rewording of Tarski's axioms, but if non-complete metric spaces also serve as models for Euclidean geometry, then it would seem that this axiom is an invention/addition of the authors, which perhaps should have been mentioned explicitly.","['real-analysis', 'model-theory', 'axioms', 'euclidean-geometry', 'soft-question']"

Let's take a distribution as follows: 0,2,4,9,10 n=5 The formulae to calculate the lower quartile and upper quartile are as follows: Q1=(n+1)/4 Q3=3*(n+1)/4 So as per these formulae, the upper and lower quartile should appear at positions 1.5 and 4.5 We can all agree here that the median of the distribution is 4 (i.e., position 3) However, to derive the upper and lower quartile values, we have to assume that the end point values of the range are 0 and 10 (i.e, position 1 and 5). Hence by this logic, and assuming the end point values of the range are 0 and 10 (position 1 and 5) and the median as 4 (position 3), we should get the upper and lower quartile positions as 2 (i.e. (1+3)/2) and 4 (i.e. (5+3)/2) respectively. However, going by the accepted formula we see that we see that the lower quartile 1.5 is a median position between a non-existant position 0 and 3, and the upper quartile 4.5 is a median position between position 3 and a non-existant position 6.

  $$\frac{a}{a^2+ab+b^2+3}+\frac{b}{b^2+bc+c^2+3}+\frac{c}{c^2+ca+a^2+3}\leq\frac{1}{2}$$ I think this inequality is very interesting because most of the contest's inequalities are homogeneous, 
but this inequality is non-homogeneous. Testing for $c=0$ gives
$$\frac{a}{a^2+ab+b^2+3}+\frac{b}{b^2+3}\leq0.455...<\frac{1}{2}.$$
For $b=c=0$ we obtain something obvious. One of the standard ways to prove these inequalities is to try to make a homogenization. By the way, trying of homogenization gives a wrong inequality:
$$\sum\limits_{cyc}\frac{a}{a^2+ab+b^2+3}\leq\sum\limits_{cyc}\frac{a}{2\sqrt{3(a^2+ab+b^2}}.$$
Thus, it remains to prove that
$$\sum\limits_{cyc}\frac{a}{\sqrt{3(a^2+ab+b^2)}}\leq1,$$
which is wrong for $c=0$ and $a\rightarrow+\infty$. Also we can try the following. We know that $\sum\limits_{cyc}\frac{x}{2x+y}\le1$ for positives $x$, $y$ and $z$. Indeed, by C-S we obtain:
$$1-\sum_{cyc}\frac{x}{2x+y}=1-\frac{3}{2}-\sum_{cyc}\left(\frac{x}{2x+y}-\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{cyc}\frac{y}{2x+y}-\frac{1}{2}=$$
$$=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{cyc}\frac{y^2}{2xy+y^2}-\frac{1}{2}\geq\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x+y+z)^2}{\sum\limits_{cyc}(y^2+2xy)}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}=0.$$
Thus, it's enough to prove that
$$a^2+ab+b^2+3\geq2(2a+\sqrt{ab})$$ 
because if it's true so 
$$\sum_{cyc}\frac{a}{a^2+ab+b^2+3}\leq\sum_{cyc}\frac{a}{2(2a+\sqrt{ab})}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{cyc}\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}}\leq\frac{1}{2}.$$
But the inequality $a^2+ab+b^2+3\geq2(2a+\sqrt{ab})$ is wrong! Try $a=2$ and $b=\frac{1}{4}$ Also we can try to use a full expanding (I tried!) and to hope to use AM-GM, but I think this way is very ugly and it's probably nothing. Any hint would be desirable.

$$ \textbf{x}(u,v)=(\cos u, \sin u, v)$$
with $v\in \mathbb{R}$ and $0<u< 2\pi$ (this is the open set $U_1=(0,2\pi)\times \mathbb{R}$) and
$$ \textbf{y}(\overline{u}, \overline{v}) = (\cos \overline{u}, \sin \overline{u}, \overline{v})$$
with $\overline{v}\equiv v\in \mathbb{R}$ and $-\pi < \overline{u} < \pi$ (this is the open set $U_2 = (-\pi,\pi)\times\mathbb{R}$). So the atlas is $\{ \textbf{x}, \textbf{y}\}$ into $U_1 \times U_2.$ So, it has two charts $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{y}$ defined in open sets (this is important: the set $(0,2 \pi]\times \mathbb{R}$ is not open , and a parametrization has to be defined into an open set).

Onto what space does $P$ project? I tried looking at videos,at textbooks, and lecture notes. Which version best answers the question? version 1: Since $ATA$ is an invertible matrix, take the normal equation $A^TAx=A^Tb$ and solve for $x$. We get, $x=(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb$. For $Ax=Pb$, we have $Ax$ as a projection, and $P$ is an orthogonal projector onto the range of $A$. It follows, $A(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb = Pb$, $\forall b$. Generally, for any matrices $M$ and $N$ s.t. $Mx=Nx$,$\forall x \Rightarrow M=N$, thus $P=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$. $P$ projects a vector $b$ onto the spaced spanned by the columns of $A$. version 2 Given a matrix $A$, the projection of $b$ onto $C(A)$ is $P=Ax$, where $x$ solves $A^TAx=A^Tb$. Since A has full column rank, $A^TA$ is invertible. We write, the projection matrix is $P=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$. version 3 The vector $Ax$ is always in the column space of $A$. We project b onto a vector $P$ in the column space of $A$ and solve $Ax=P$. In matrix form, $A^T(b-Ax)=0 \Rightarrow A^TAx=A^Tb$. Since $A^TA$ is a square matrix, we multiply by $(A^TA)^{-1}$ In $n$ dimensions, $x=(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb \Rightarrow P=Ax=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb \Rightarrow P=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$",['linear-algebra']

2178808,Is there a name for this algebraic structure in which $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$?,"Today I was toying around with reflecting points over other points, which I expanded to reflecting lists of points over other lists of points.  In the process, I found an interesting yet somewhat bizarre algebraic structure to describe what I was doing, and I would like to know if there exists a name for it or if similar structures have been studied previously. What follows is a description of the ""observed properties"" of this algebraic structure.  I'm not currently certain which properties should be considered axioms and which are derived from others. Let $(R, +, \cdot )$ be a set $R$ with two binary operations. Furthermore, each element of this set belongs to one of two possible ""types."" Each element of the first type (to be indicated with a subscript $_0$ such as $a_0$) represents a ""translation,"" while each element of the second type ($a_1$) represents a ""reflection.""  If a subscript is not provided then the relation should hold regardless of the type. Addition acts as a ""list-like"" operator, based on how it interacts with multiplication (described later).  It is associative but not commutative. $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$ When two elements are added, their types xor together. $$a_x + b_y = c_{x \oplus y}$$ Any element added to its negation (additive inverse) results in the identity. $$a + -a = I_0$$
$$a + I_0 = I_0 + a = a$$ Any type-$1$ element is its own negation, as is the identity, but all other type-$0$ elements do not equal their negation. $$a_1 = -a_1$$
$$I_0 = -I_0$$ Swapping the order of operands require that you negate both operands and the expression.  The negation does not ""distribute"" over addition. $$a + b = -(-b + -a)$$ I believe, but am not entirely certain, that $(R, +)$ qualifies as a group. The multiplication operation represents the translation/reflection of one element by/over another: reflection of $a_1$ over $b_1$ $$a_1 \cdot b_1 = c_1$$ $$a_1 \cdot a_1 = a_1$$ translation of $a_1$ by $b_0$ $$a_1 \cdot b_0 = c_1$$ reflection of $a_0$ over $b_1$ $$a_0 \cdot b_1 = -a_0$$ translation of $a_0$ by $b_0$ $$a_0 \cdot b_0 = a_0$$ The identity plays a special role here as well: $$a \cdot I_0 = a$$
$$I_0 \cdot a = I_0$$ Multiplication is a non-associative, non-commutative, yet flexible operation, meaning that the following always holds: $$(a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a)$$ Furthermore, $$(a \cdot b) \cdot -a = (a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a) = a \cdot (b \cdot -a)$$ My somewhat bizarre addition operation was constructed to give multiplication of property of ""folding over"" addition from the left. That is, $$a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$$
$$a \cdot (b + c + d + \ldots + y + z) = a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot \ldots  \cdot y \cdot z$$ I call this ""folding"" based on programming terminology, and I think this property is one of the more interesting ones.  It follows from the above that there is no concept of left(?) division: $$a \cdot (b + a) = (a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a)$$
$$(b + a) \ne (b \cdot a)$$
$$a_0 \cdot b_0 = a_0 = a_0 \cdot c_0$$
$$b_0 \ne c_0$$ Multiplication also distributes right, similar to the concept of ""mapping"" in programming. $$(b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$$ Negating the first argument of a multiplication expression is equivalent to negating the whole expression. $$-a \cdot b = -(a \cdot b)$$ There also also some other useful equations to relate addition, multiplication, and negation: $$-a + b + a = b \cdot a$$
$$a \cdot b = c \leftrightarrow c \cdot -b = a$$
$$a_0 \cdot b = a_0 \cdot -b$$ Again, I am not entirely confident on the self-consistency of these relationships.  I don't have a real axiomatization yet.  With the properties above I've been able to ""prove"" some simple equivalences such as $$c_x \cdot (c_x \cdot a_1) \cdot b_x = c_x \cdot (b_x \cdot a_1 \cdot c_x)$$ which corresponds to this diagram (which uses ""r"" for ""reflection"" instead of ""$\cdot$""): Have similar algebraic structures been named/studied before?  I am particularly interested in structures that obey $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$.  If possible, I would also like to find ways to reduce the role of ""typing"" in the properties listed above.","['terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"
2178827,A method to evaluate functional roots of $e^x$,"I've an idea to find exact function $f(x)$ such that $f(f(x))=e^x$. But it involves solving complicated systems of non-linear equations, the skills for which I don't have. Here's how I intend to do it: The Taylor series of $e^x$ around $x=0$ is:
$$1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+......$$
If we assume our required function $f(x)$ to be:
$$f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+......a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$$
i.e. a polynomial of degree $n$. From that we can get $f(f(x))$. I think it can be proved that the  $f(f(x))$ that we get will have terms containing all the powers of $x$ ranging from $x^{(n^2)}$ to $x^0$ (i.e. a constant term). Now, when $x$ is small the higher power terms don't matter, so we ignore the terms containing $x^{n+1}$, $x^{n+2}$.........$x^{(n^2)}$. After ignoring these terms, the remaining terms contain these powers of $x$: $x^0$, $x$, $x^2$,........$x^n$. Now, we compare the coefficients of these terms with the coefficients of the like powers of $x$ in the Taylor series of $e^x$. In this way, we get $n+1$ equations in $n+1$ variables. Now, we solve these equations to get the coefficients $a_0,a_1,a_2......a_n$. These will be functions of $n$ (I think). Now we apply $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}$ to these functions to get the exact value of coefficients. It would be a stressful task to solve those non-linear equations to get the coefficients in terms of $n$. But would this method work? EDIT: Even if $x$ is not small, the higher power terms can be ignored because the higher power terms will have very large factorials in their denominators. Also, we're applying $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}$ in the end and $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}=0$ for any finite $x$. EDIT:By using a first degree polynomial, I got this function, which when applied twice to $c$ gives you exactly $a^c$(not approximately because I didn't have to ignore any terms in case of a first degree polynomial) :
$$x\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)}{\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+1}$$
 Problem is it itself depends upon $c$, so I guess there's a family of these square-root functions.
Similarly, the $n^{th}$ root of $a^x$ at $x=c$ is:
$$x(a^c\log_ea)^{\frac{1}{n}}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)}{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(a^c\log_ea)^{\frac{k}{n}}}$$
$$=x(a^c\log_ea)^{\frac{1}{n}}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)((a^c\log_ea)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1)}{a^c\log_ea-1}$$ At $x=c$, my square-root function is: $$c\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)}{\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+1}$$. Now substituting this in place of $x$ is my function gives, $$\left(c\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)}{\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+1}\right)\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+\frac{a^c(1-c\log_ea)}{\sqrt{a^c\log_ea}+1}$$ $$=ca^c\log_ea+a^c(1-c\log_ea)$$ $$=a^c$$","['taylor-expansion', 'polynomials', 'systems-of-equations', 'exponential-function', 'functions']"

(I'm thinking of the free group on two generators as the fundamental group of the plane minus two points; each generator corresponds to wrapping the string around one of the nails.) The commutator $[a,b] = aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ is the simplest solution: the set of elements that work is (I think) exactly the commutator subgroup of $\mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$. I want to know about the analogous question for the free group on $a,b$ and $c$: if $f_a, f_b$ and $f_c$ denote the quotients by the generators $a,b$ and $c$, respectively, then what is the intersection $H$ of the kernels of $f_a, f_b$ and $f_c$? $H$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$, since the intersection of normal subgroups is normal, and it's non-trivial: one element that works is $[a,b]c[a,b]^{-1}c^{-1}$. Is there a nice characterization of this subgroup as in the case with two generators? This paper has a lot of cool results about this type of question, though their work is mostly about finding the shortest length word that satisfies the condition I'm talking about. As far as I can see, they don't discuss a characterization of all solutions to the painting puzzles. If we can find a solution for the free group on three generators, maybe we can generalize: let $H_k^n$ be the intersection of the kernels of all the quotient maps of the free group on $n$ generators by any distinct $k$ generators.

2178981,"Clarification of answer to ""Connectedness of the spectrum of a tensor product""","I recently came across this interesting question here on Mathematics Stackexchange: Connectedness of the spectrum of a tensor product Its only answer is excellent, but there is one part of it that I don't understand. The answerer claims that $i_g(X)\cap i_h(X)\neq\varnothing$ if and only if $gh^{-1}$ belongs to the inertia subgroup $I_x$ of some $x\in X$. First of all I believe that should be $h^{-1}g$ in stead of $gh^{-1}$, but more pertinently it seems to me that it is sufficient that $h^{-1}g$ belongs to the decomposition group $G_x$ of some $x\in X$. After all, if $i_g(x)=i_h(y)$ for some $x,y\in X$ then $x=y$ and $g(x)=h(y)=h(x)$, so $h^{-1}g\in G_x$. Although this is no problem for the validity of the proof, it does leave me wondering what I am misunderstanding, if anything at all. EDIT: I see now that if $h^{-1}g\in I_x$ then $gh^{-1}=h(h^{-1}g)h^{-1}\in I_{hx}$, so my first concern is solved. But my main point of confusion, that I believe it to be sufficient for $h^{-1}g$ (or $gh^{-1}$) to belong to a decomposition group in stead of an inertia group, remains.","['algebraic-geometry', 'connectedness', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'proof-explanation']"

I am currently studying ""Stochastic Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction"", by Wei Liu and Michael RÃ¶ckner and in Chapter 4, they introduce the Gelfand triple $\left(V,H,V^*\right)$ and sketch the situation where they work in. For this Gelfand triple (or evolution triple), we have a reflexive Banach space $\left(V,\|\cdot\|_{V}\right)$ and a Hilbert space $\left(H,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{H}\right)$, such that $V \subset H$ and $V$ can be continuously and densely embedded in $H$. It also follows that $H^*$ can be densely embedded into $V^*$, by restricting the functionals on $H$ to $V$ (call this (isomorphic!) map $\rho$). As the Hilbert space $H$ and its dual are isomorphic by the Riesz representation map $\Phi$, we can identify $H$ and its image under the map $\rho\circ\Phi$; we will write $\bar{H}$ for $\rho(\Phi(H))$. Then, they claim that by Kuratowski's theorem , we know that

V \in \mathcal{B}(H) \quad \text{ and } \quad \bar{H}\in\mathcal{B}\left(V^*\right)

Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1977: 27-67. Let $\chi:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^*\longrightarrow\mathbb{C}^*$ be a character ($\mod N$),
and $\kappa$ be a positive
odd integer.
A function $f$ on upper half plane $H$ is called a modular form of type $(\kappa,\chi)$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$ if $f(\gamma z) = \chi(d) j(\gamma,z)^\kappa f (z)$ for every $\gamma=\left(

           in $\Gamma_0$
this makes sense since $4\mid N$; f is holomorphic, both on H and at the cusps. One then calls $\kappa/2$ the weight of $f$, and $\chi$ its character.

of such forms will be denoted by $M_0(N,\kappa/2,\chi).$ Besides, operator $V(m)$ is defined by

[f\mid V(m)](z):=f(mz).

The 1st type should be exponentially increasing, and the 2nd type should be exponentially decaying. for our application, we are only interested in the exponentially decaying solution, which has a physically meaning. The equation can be discussed in two cases: $\nu=0$ and $\nu\neq 0$. When $\nu=0$, the equation system becomes: $$x^2E''(x)+xE'(x)-p_2x^2E(x)=0,$$ $$x^2G''(x)+xG'(x)-q_2x^2G(x)=0.$$ Therefore, $E(x)$ and $G(x)$ are uncoupled, which are both modified Bessel equations. The general solution of them are: $$E(x)=C_1I_0(\sqrt{p_2}x)+C_2K_0(\sqrt{p_2}x)$$
$$G(x)=D_1I_0(\sqrt{q_2}x)+D_2K_0(\sqrt{q_2}x)$$ Since the $I_0(x)$ function will have the infinite value when $x\to \infty$, we have to remove it. Hence the solution will be
$$E(x)=C_2K_0(\sqrt{p_2}x)$$
$$G(x)=D_2K_0(\sqrt{q_2}x)$$ However, when $\nu\neq 0$, things become complicated. We are expecting that the solution would be the combination of Bessel functions and the total behavior is similar to $K_{\nu}(x)$. But unfortunately, we don't know how to solve this problem.

My effort: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $E$ is a dense subset of $X$, and $f$ is a continuous mapping of $X$ into $Y$. Let $q$ be any point of $f(X)$. Then this point $q = f(p)$ for some point $p$ of $X$. Let $V$ be any open set in $Y$ containing $q$. Then $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set in $X$ containing $p$. So there is a point $a \in E$ such that $a \in f^{-1}(V)$, which implies that $f(a) \in f(E) \cap V$, from which it follows that $f(E)$ is dense in $f(X)$. Am I right? Now for the second result: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $E$ is a dense subset of $X$, $f$ and $g$ are continuous mappings of $X$ into $Y$, and $g(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in E$. Let $p \in X$. What next?","['real-analysis', 'continuity', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"
2179824,Differential equation $cos(x-t)=x'$,"So we have following equation to solve: $$\cos(x-t)=x'$$ This is the first time I use substitution, so I want to ensure that I'm doing it correctly, even though it is probably very easy example.
We have: $$\cos(x-t)=\frac{dx}{dt}$$ We substitute $y=x-t$ $$\cos y=\frac{d(y+t)}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}+1$$ So: $$dt=\frac{dy}{\cos y-1}$$ And now I have to solve integrals: $$\int dt=\int\frac{dy}{\cos y-1}$$ Is it correct?","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2179831,Derivative of $x|x|$,"I am trying to find the derivative of $f(x)=x|x|$ using the defition of derivative. For $x > 0$ I found that $f'(x)=2x$ and for $x<0$ the derivative is $f'(x)=-2x$. Everything is fine up to here. Now I want to check what happens when at $x=0$. By the way, I know that $|x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$. So I am checking the left & right limits of $f$ when $x$ approaches $0$. $\lim_{x \to 0^-}\cfrac{x|x|}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0^-}\cfrac{x(-x)}{x}=\lim_{x \to 0^-}\cfrac{(-x)}{1} = -0? = 0. $ $\lim_{x \to 0^+}\cfrac{x|x|}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0^4}\cfrac{x(x)}{x}=\lim_{x \to 0^+}\cfrac{(x)}{1} = 0. $ I think that $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ since $|x|$ is not differentiable at that point. So , what do I do wrong? Should I write something like $\lim_{x \to 0^-}\cfrac{x|x|}{x} = -0^{-}$ and $\lim_{x \to 0^+}\cfrac{x|x|}{x} =0^{+}$ so that $f'$ does not exist at $x=0$?","['algebra-precalculus', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
2179854,Alternative solutions for $\cos(x)=-\frac{1}{2}$,"I have a function $f(x)=x+2\sin(x)$ and we are asked to find at which points the graph of $f$ has  Horizontal tangents. How we solve is to find where $f'=0$.  So $$f' = 1+ 2\cos x = 0 \implies \cos x = -\frac 12$$ and from this, to determine the solution set. I am familiar with unit circle and periodicity of $\sin,\cos$ functions so I found out that the solution set is $$x \in \left\{(2k+1)\pi \pm \frac{\pi}{3}:   k \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$ I know that is the usual way but is there any alternative solution -simpler if possible- to this problem? Especially for the people who does not the subject well?","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"
