1791161,Example of a projective variety that is not projectively normal but normal,"I want to prove the following statement: Let $Y$ be the quartic curve in $\mathbb{P}^3$ given parametrically by $(x,y,z,w)=(t^4,t^3u,tu^3,u^4)$.

To show it is normal, we can consider the affine patches parametrized by $(x,y,z)=(t^4,t^3,t)$ and $(y,z,w)=(u,u^3,u^4)$, each of the patches has affine coordinate ring isomorphic to $k[t]$, which is a UFD and hence normal.

1791220,the area that a part of an ellipse consumes in a square of a discrete grid,"Think about a discrete grid of unit 1, which means the grid consists of infinite number of squares whose area is 1. You can assign a coordinate to each square and one of them will have the coordinate (0, 0). The other squares will be assigned a coordinate in a way analogous to the 2-dimensional cartesian coordinate system. You can also draw 0-dimensional dots on this grid and those dots will have coordinates of real numbers. A dot with integer coordinates are in the exact center of a square. So a dot (1.5, 3) will be on the center of the edge between square (1, 3) and (2, 3). On this grid, we want to draw an ellipse whose center is a dot ($x$, $y$) and whose horizontal and vertical radius is $a$ and $b$ respectively. Some squares on the grid will be completely full with the ellipse, some others will be partly full, and the left ones will be empty. Let us pick an arbitrary square ($p$, $q$), and we want to know the area that the ellipse consumes in this square. This would be a function of 6 inputs: $x$, $y$ for the coordinate of the center of the ellipse; $a$, $b$ for the horizontal and vertical radius of the ellipse; and $p$, $q$ for the coordinate of the square in our interest.

1791264,"Double Integral $\int\limits_0^\pi \int\limits_0^\pi|\cos(x+y)|\,dx\,dy$","First off, I apologize for any English mistakes.I've come across a double integral problem that I haven't been able to solve: Find 
$$\int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi|\cos(x+y)|\,dx\,dy$$
Intuitively, I thought it could be solved in a similar manner to what you would do for a regular integral with and absolute value. For example, to solve $\int_0^\pi |\cos(x)| \,dx$, you just take the interval where $\cos(x)$ is positive and multiply it by two:
$$\int_0^\pi |\cos(x)|\,dx = 2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos(x) \, dx$$
So I naively assumed my initial problem could be solved in a similar manner, that is:
$$\int_0^\pi \int_0^\pi |\cos(x+y)| \,dx\,dy = 4\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\cos(x+y) \,dx\,dy$$
However, this does not give me the right answer. I'm not really sure how this integral is actually solved.

1791270,"If the difference of two independent random variables has a mean, so does each variable","This is a proof-verification request; I’m also recording this proof for my own later reference. Any feedback is appreciated. Claim: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent, real-valued random variables on some probability space $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb P)$. If $X-Y$ has a finite mean, then $X$ and $Y$ have finite means as well. Proof: Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ denote the probability measures induced by $X$ and $Y$, respectively, on $(\mathbb R,\mathscr B_{\mathbb R})$, where $\mathscr B$ stands for the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ induced on $(\mathbb R^2,\mathscr B_{\mathbb R^2})$ is given by the product measure $\mu\otimes\nu$. Then, one has that
\begin{align*}
\infty>&\,\mathbb E|X-Y|=\int_{\omega\in\Omega}|X(\omega)-Y(\omega)|\,\mathrm d\mathbb P(\omega)=\int_{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2}|x-y|\,\mathrm d(\mu\otimes\nu)(x,y)\\
=&\,\int_{y\in\mathbb R}\int_{x\in\mathbb R}|x-y|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)\,\mathrm d\nu(y),
\end{align*}
where the last equality stems from Tonelli’s theorem. This yields that the function $$y\mapsto\int_{x\in\mathbb R}|x-y|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)$$ is finite-valued almost everywhere (measured with respect to $\nu$). In particular, there is some $y_0\in\mathbb R$ such that $$\int_{x\in\mathbb R}|x-y_0|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)<\infty,$$ which furthermore yields $$\mathbb E|X|=\int_{\omega\in\Omega}|X(\omega)|\,\mathrm d\mathbb P(\omega)=\int_{x\in\mathbb R}|x|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)\leq \int_{x\in\mathbb R}|x-y_0|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)+\underbrace{\int_{x\in\mathbb R}|y_0|\,\mathrm d\mu(x)}_{=|y_0|}<\infty.$$ The argument showing that $\mathbb E|Y|<\infty$ is completely analogous. $\blacksquare$","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

1791458,Conditional independence of stopping times from i.i.d. stochastic processes,"My question is somewhat arbitrary but I was thinking about independence of processes and stopping times. Say that we define two processes $X,Y$ on different probability spaces $(\Omega^i,\mathcal{F}^i,\mathbb{P}^i)$ , $i=1,2$ and we take the product space. We redefine the processes by $X(\omega^1,\omega^2)=X(\omega^1)$ and $Y(\omega^1,\omega^2)=Y(\omega^2)$ . The product space is denoted $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ . By product space properties independence follows directly with this notion of independence of stochastic processes: Two stochastic processes $X:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ and $Y:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\lambda)$ ( $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure) are independent if \begin{align}\label{eq 1}
\mathbb{P}((X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n})\in A \cap (Y_{s_1},\dots,Y_{s_m}) \in B) = \mathbb{P}((X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n})\in A)\mathbb{P}((Y_{s_1},\dots,Y_{s_m}) \in B) \\  \forall_{m,n \in \mathbb{N}} \quad \forall t_i,s_i \in [0,\infty) \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n), \forall B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^m)
\end{align} Also we define stopping times by the hitting times for some set in the ranges of $X$ and $Y$ (say $\mathbb{R}$ ). So denote the sets $A$ and $B$ then the stopping times are $T_X=\inf_{t \geq 0}\{X_t \in A\}$ and $T_Y=\inf_{t \geq 0}\{Y_t \in B\}$ . By product space properties these are also independent. (This is all logical up unto this point). But now say that $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are both distributed identically with some sort of distribution that depends on a parameter $\alpha$ . If $\alpha$ is deterministic there is no problem, but when $\alpha$ is stochastic there could be a problem. Now the independence is not a given since all finite dimensional distributions depend on $\alpha$ . So it would be natural to assume that given $\alpha$ we would have independence. So $T_X$ and $T_Y$ are conditionally independent, given $\alpha$ . The build of the model is easy. We just add a auxiliary probability space to the product space and extend definitions as before and view the new complete space. But how should we now handle the conditional independence as a probability statement (e.g. $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B|\alpha)=\mathbb{P}(A|\alpha))\mathbb{P}(B|\alpha)$ ? To make my question somewhat more specific: how does the conditioning on $\alpha$ work in the pre-image $T_X^{-1}(A)$ . If $\alpha$ is deterministic we can work without the auxiliary space and we just get a set of the form $A \times \Omega^2$ as pre-image. But if $\alpha$ is given, what form does this pre-image take? edit: I had the idea that if $\alpha$ is given, it is known that $\alpha=a$ for some $a \in range(\alpha)$ . Hence the pre-image would be $A \times \Omega^2 \times \alpha^{-1}(a)$ ?","['stochastic-processes', 'independence', 'stopping-times', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"

For any $E\subset X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $A\in \mathcal{A}_\sigma$ with $E\subset A$ and $\mu^*(A) \leq \mu^*(E) + \epsilon$. b.) If $\mu^{*}(E) < \infty$, then $E$ is $\mu^{*}$-measurable if and only if there exists $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ with $E\subset B$ and $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ c.) If $\mu_0$ is $\sigma$-finite, the restriction $\mu^{*}(E) < \infty$ in (b) is superfluous a.) By the definition of outermeasure we know that $$\mu^{*}(E) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu_{0} ( A_{j} ) : A_{j} \in \mathcal{A}, E \subset \bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_{j} \right \}$$ Let $A = \bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_{j}$ as above. Then $A \in \mathcal{A}_{\sigma}$ and $E \subset A$. For each $j$ we can construct a sequence $\{ B_{j}^{k} \} _{k=1}^{\infty}\subset A_\sigma$ such that $A_j\subset \bigcup_{j,k=1}^{\infty}B_{j}^{k}$. It follows that since $$\mu^{*}(A_j) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu_{0} (B_{j}^{k} ) : B_{j}^{k} \in \mathcal{A}, A_j \subset \bigcup_{j,k=1}^{\infty} B_{j}^{k} \right \}$$ We have that, $$\mu^{*}(A_{j}) \leq \mu_{0}(A_{j}) + \epsilon 2^{-j}, \forall j \ \ \text{and} \ \ \epsilon>0$$ Thus: $$\mu^{*}(A) \leq  \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu^{*} ( A_{j} ) \leq \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} ( \mu_{0}(A_{j}) + \epsilon 2^{-j}) = \mu^{*}(E) + \epsilon$$ Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary we are done. b.) Suppose $E$ is $\mu^{*}$-measurable. From part (a), we know that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $B_n\in A_\sigma$ with $E\subset B_n$ and $\mu^{*}(B_n) - \mu^{*}(E) \leq 1/n$. Let, $$B = \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}B_n\in A_\sigma$$ since E is $\mu^{*}$-measurable, we have $\mu^{*}(B_n) = \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E) + \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E^{c})$ hence, $$\mu^{*}(B\cap E^{c})\leq \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E^{c})= \mu^{*}(B_n) - \mu^{*}(E)\leq 1/n$$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Hence we have $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$\ To show the converse, let's suppose $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ with $E\subset B$ and $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$. From part (a), we know that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $A_n\in A_\sigma$ with $(B\setminus E)\subset A_n$ and $\mu^{*}(A_n) - \mu^{*}(B\setminus E)\leq 1/n$. But, since $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ then, $\mu^{*}(A_n)\leq 1/n$. Let, $$A = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$$ then A is $\mu^{*}$-measurable (since $A\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ and the set of all $\mu^{*}$-measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra) such that $(B\setminus E)\subset A$ and $\mu^{*}(A) = 0$.\ By Carathedors's theorem we know that the restriction of $\mu^{*}$ to $\mu^{*}$-measurable sets is a complete measure. From this, we know that $(B\setminus E)$ is $\mu^{*}$-measurable. Also, since $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ then $B$ is also $\mu^{*}$-measurable and we can express $E$ as $$E = (B^{c}\cup (B\cap E^{c}))^{c}$$ Thus $E$ is $\mu^{*}$-measurable. c.) Let $\mu_0$ be $\sigma$-finite, then let $$X = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}X_i$$ where $X_i\in M$ and $\mu(X_i) < \infty$ Now, suppose $E$ is $\mu^{*}$-measurable and $\mu^{*}(E) = \infty$, set $$E_n = (E\cap \bigcup_{1}^{n}X_i)$$ then $\mu^{*}(E_n) < \infty$ and $E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_n$. Let $\epsilon > 0$, from part (a) $\forall n\in\mathbb{N} \exists C_n\in A_\sigma$ such that $E_n\subset C_n$ and $$\mu^{*}(C_n\setminus E_n) = \mu^{*}(C_n) - \mu^{*}(E_n) \leq \epsilon/2^{-n}$$ Let $$C_{\epsilon} = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}C_n$$ The $\epsilon$ in $C_\epsilon$ is there to stress the dependence upon $\epsilon$ of $C_n$'s and hence of $C$. Notice that, $C_\epsilon\in A_\delta$ being the countable union of unions of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ Intuitively, $C_\epsilon$ is a decent approximation pf $E$: $$\mu^{*}(C_\epsilon\cap E^{c}) = \mu^{*}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(C_n\cap E^{c})\right) = \mu^{*}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(C_n\cap E_n^{c})\right) \leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu^{*}(C_n\setminus E_n) \leq \epsilon$$ Let's go back to our intuition: $C_{\epsilon}$ is an $\epsilon$-good approximation of $E$, therefore we would like to send $\epsilon$ to $0$ to get the best possible approximation. Since we want to end up in $\mathcal{A}_{\sigma \delta}$ what we need to do is to ""discretize"" the sets $C_{\epsilon}$ considering instead the sets $C_{\frac{1}{n}}$.Then clearly $$C := \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}C_{\frac{1}{n}} \in \mathcal{A}_{\sigma \delta}$$ and satisfies $\mu^*(C \setminus E) = 0$, proving the claim. To show this last equality notice that $$\mu^*(C \setminus E) \le \mu^*(C_{\frac{1}{n}} \setminus E) \le \frac{1}{n} \to 0.$$ Exercise 19 - Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on $X$ induced from a finite premeasure $\mu_0$. If $E\subset X$, define the inner measure of $E$ to be $\mu_*(E) = \mu_0(X) - \mu^*(E^c)$. Then $E$ is $\mu^*$-measurable iff $\mu^*(E) = \mu_*(E)$ (Use Exercise 18). Since $E\supset X$ then $E$ is $\mu^*$-measurable says $$\mu^*(X) = \mu^*(E) + \mu^*(E\cap X^c)$$ then $$\mu^*(E) = \mu^*(X) - \mu^*(E\cap X^c)$$ As you can see we have that $\mu^*(E)$ which is the outer measure of $E$ is equal to the inner measure of $E$. But I am not sure if this what we need for the $\Rightarrow$ part of the proof since the inner measure of $E$ is defined in a different way.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

For example, the twin primes conjecture, Goldbach's conjecture, the Riemann hypothesis, infinitude of Mersenne's primes, and many many more. A widespread convention of ""rigorous construction of the number system"" is von Neumann's finite ordinals, constructed with ZF axioms, i.e. well-ordered transitive sets ordered by the $\in$ relation. It can be shown that these finite ordinals satisfies Peano's arithmetic axioms. As an electric engineer who designs and constructs a building knows all about the power sockets in the buildings, I would expect that the construction of the natural numbers should imply many things about the behaviors of those numbers, in particular prime numbers. So my question is, is there a relation? Are there any clues in the way we construct the numbers that can help us reveal more about numbers? Are there any set-theoretic characteristics of prime numbers?

Why is $\mathbf{u}_i$ being sent to $\left(\mathbf{v}^{\text{T}}\cdot A^{\text{T}}\right)_i?$ (If I am reading that right that is). Why is $\alpha$ acting on $\mathbf{u}$ not the same as $A$ acting on $\mathbf{u}$ i.e. so $\left(A\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)_i$ instead? Similarly it says that if $\alpha$ is represented by $A$ w.r.t. bases $\{\mathbf{u}_i\},\{\mathbf{v}_j\}$ and $\tilde A$ w.r.t. bases $\{ \mathbf{\tilde u}_i\},\{\mathbf{\tilde v}_j\}$ where $\mathbf{\tilde u}_i=\sum_k P_{ki}\mathbf{u}_k$ and $\mathbf{\tilde v}_j=\sum_k Q_{kj}\mathbf{v}_k$ then:

Namely: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two variables with joint distribution $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$, which is jointly analytic in $x$ and $y$. Does this imply that the marginal distributions $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ are continous? I could create counterexamples if the statement is strengthened to imply differentiability (see below), or starting from smooth joint distributions, but the latter all had essential singularities (take for example this , as provided by hcl14 ). However, the derivatives of $f$ in $x$ and $y$ would not necessarily be integrable, so an obvious expansion in power series would not work, unfortunately. For (a little convoluted) example: Consider 
  \begin{equation}
f_{X,Y}(x,y):=\frac{2 \sin (x y)e^{-y} }{x^2+1}, \qquad x\geq0, y\geq 0
\end{equation}
  Then $f$ is analytic in $x$ and $y$ (however it is not holomorphic, it has poles in $x=\pm i$), and a straightforward calculation verifies that it defines a joint distribution. However, its power series in $y$ around $0$ is not integrable in $x$:
  \begin{equation}
f_{X,Y}(x,y)=\frac{2 x y}{x^2+1}-\frac{2 x y^2}{x^2+1}+\mathcal{O}[y]^3

for all Schwartz function $\varphi$. Here, let's say I take the convention that the Fourier transform is
$$\hat\varphi(\xi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_\mathbb R e^{-i x\xi}\varphi(x) \, dx.$$
 In particular, one can show that the Fourier transform of $1$ is the Dirac delta $\delta_0$. Here, $1$ is in the sense of tempered distribution, defined by
$$\langle 1,\varphi\rangle=\int\varphi(x)\,dx.$$
No problem there. However, I have come across a confusing usage of this fact: I was reading a proof of some estimate, the author claimed that ($g$ is just some function of $x$) $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_\mathbb{R}\int_\mathbb{R} e^{-ixt}g(x)\,dt\,dx=\int_\mathbb{R}\delta(x)g(x)dx.$$
It looks like the author took the Fourier transform of $1$ ""at the point $x$"". But this is confusing to me because I don't understand what it means to take Fourier transform ""at a point"". I also don't understand what $\delta(x)$ means, and what it means to ""integrate"" it.

Length of 'unwrapped' de Bruijn sequence is (in binary case) $2^{n} + n - 1$ (de Bruijn word is such a shortest word containing all words of length $n$ as subwords, e.g. for $n=2$ the word 00110) Imagine an experiment consisting of sequence of coin tosses. We can (and we want to!) stop this truly tedious activity if we spot a predetermined sequence. It's possible to compute an expected time of this, more precisely expected time of the first occurrence of the given sequence. For example for three heads in a row, HHH, it is 14 coin tosses. Let's look at this experiment as the organizers. We have lots of subjects and for each of them we generate randomly and uniformly some $n$-word ($n$ is fixed), we are interested in the average time it takes for subjects to complete their task. More precisely, now even the predetermined sequence is chosen randomly. The answer is again $2^n + n - 1$, as is computed in here . It works for larger alphabets as well (and more sided coins??). Is there a connection? If not precise, at least some heuristics. Or is it just a pure coincidence? (Coincidences in maths? There's no such thing I want to believe.)","['recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics-on-words']"

I understand everything in terms of the fundamental domain of these spaces, i.e. the 3-cube. For $T^3$, if I set out in any one of 3 mutually perpendicular directions, I'd eventually come back to where I started in the same orientation. If I let my dog out for a walk in any of the three directions and he returned, the leash would get caught on the space, as this is a genus 1 object. For $S^3$, everything would seem the same, except I would always be able to pull my dog's leash back. For $S^2 \times S^1$ I guess everything would look the same but if my dog went in one particular direction the leash would get caught on the space? Is there a space where in two directions the leash gets caught in the space, but in the third it doesn't? Finally, I suppose $\mathbb{R}P^3$ is similar to $S^3$: the leash never gets caught, but when my dog comes back his orientation is reversed. Can I interact with my dog when he's reversed? Does the dog only appear to be reversed to me?Does he appear in his original orientation to himself? If someone can help me clean up these interpretations, I would be very grateful.

Let's say that I want to calculate the probability that in a group of 20 people, NO two people have the same birthday. So, for 20 people with different birthdays, I can choose the first birthday in 365 ways, the second in 364 ways and so on, while for 20 people who can have the same birthday, I can choose the first birthday in 365 ways, the second also in 365 ways, and so on. At the end: $p={365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363 \cdot ... \cdot 346 \over 365 \cdot 365 \cdot 365 \cdot ... \cdot 365}\approx 0.59$ This is the right method and I understand it. I don't understand why the following method is wrong: The probability that in a group of 20 people NO two people have the same birthday is the ratio between the combination without repetition of 20 birthdays and the combination with repetition of 20 birthdays: $$p={C_{365,20} \over C'_{365,20}}={\binom{365}{20} \over \left(\binom{365}{20}\right)}={\binom{365}{20} \over \binom{365+20-1}{20}}=\frac{{{365!}\over {20!\cdot(365-20)!}}}{{(365+20-1)!}\over{20!\cdot{(365-1)!}}}\approx 0.35$$ I understand the mistake is in the denominator (as the numerator is the same of the other method, after simplifying that 20! ), but why?

At first glance, the problem seemed extremely trivial, however the solution to it seems to be deceptively tricky (at least to me at this moment in time). Problem: Find two positive numbers whose difference is $100$ and whose product is a minimum My Attempted Solution : Let's assume, $a, b \in \mathbb{R^+}$, $b < a$ First we set up an equation for the difference of $a, b$, I've used absolute values to restrict $a,b$ to values $\geq 0$
$$|a| - |b| = 100$$
$$\implies |a| = 100 + |b|$$ Next we set up an equation for the product of $a, b$ $$(|a|)(|b|) = b^2 +  100|b| \ \ \ \ $$ Defining a function $f$, to minimize to product of $a , b$ : $$f(b) = b^2 + 100|b|$$

Although that is a valid solution ( EDIT: As correctly pointed out in an answer below, this is also a contradiction ), they are not the minimum values. The correct values, just thinking about it should be, $a = 100$, $b = 0$. However, trying to minimize it, using the equations I set up, don't yield the correct solution. Why is that so? .

It is consistent with $\sf ZF$ that there is a Lebesgue nonmeasurable set $A=\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}A_n$ that is a countable union of countable sets. (I actually made the second statement up, but given the results in this area it seems plausible. It is of course sufficient to have a model of the first statement, in which there exists a nonmeasurable set, to satisfy the second.) Clearly, countable subadditivity of $\lambda^*$ is violated in these models: compare $\lambda^*(\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}R_n)=\infty$ to $\sum_{n\in\Bbb N}\lambda^*(R_n)=0$, where the $R_n$ are assumed disjoint. Measurable sets are also not closed under countable union in the second model, with $A$ as the counterexample. What I haven't managed to show is whether it is false that measurable functions are closed under addition. (Here a measurable function is one such that $f^{-1}(O)$ is measurable for every open set $O$, not just the intervals.)

When she exits the tunnel, the same mountain has a bearing of $258^\circ$ and its peak has an angle of elevation of $31^\circ$. Assuming the tunnel is perfectly level and straight, how long is it? I had two problems with this question. I was getting two different answers using methods that should give the same answer and neither of those answers matched with the answer in the textbook. Attempt 1: What we want to figure out is the value for $d$. If we can figure out the values for $x$ and $y$, then we can use Pythagorean theorem to figure out the value for $d$. In this case, $$x = \frac{1515}{\tan 35^\circ} \qquad\text{and}\qquad y = \frac{1515}{tan 31^\circ}$$ We also know that $d =\sqrt{y^{2}-x^{2}}$, so $$d = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1515}{\tan 31^\circ}\right)^{2}- \left(\frac{1515}{\tan 35^\circ}\right)^{2}}$$ This makes the value of $d$ about 1294 meters. Attempt 2: We can figure out the value for $\theta$. In the ground level triangle $\theta = 258^\circ -180^\circ = 78^\circ$. This also means $\gamma = 90^\circ - 78^\circ = 12^\circ$. In the solution above, we figured out the value for $x$ and $y$. We can use trig ratios to figure out the value for $d$. $$\tan\gamma = \frac{d}{x} \qquad\to\qquad d = x \tan 12^\circ = \frac{1515 \tan 12^\circ}{\tan 35^\circ}$$ This gives a value for $d$ equal to about $460$ meter.

See this: Each point has some nonnegative height assigned to it (i.e. height can be 0 on up). I'm trying to accurately compute the volume of this...polyhedron(?) My work so far has been looking clusters of 4 points (i.e. little squares inside the grid made up of 4 points), and trying to calculate the volume of the polyhedron made up of those 4 points and the 4 points with the height values. Think this: The trouble with this method is that the polyhedrons aren't necessarily convex, and that means I can't easily use an algorithm to break up each polyhedron into tetrahedron and sum the their volumes. Any thoughts? Would it be better to apply some sort of algorithm to the entire circular grid which could break it into disjoint, convex polyhedrons; then use another algorithm to compute the volume of each one via breaking it into tetrahedrons? I apologize for what may be a noobish question, and for not having much in the way of work to show what I have attempted. Geometry has never been a strength of mine, and I'm not really sure the best way to start approaching this problem. edit/update Thanks for all the quick answers / suggestions! This community always amazes me. Sorry for my delay in responding. Went out of town today to celebrate my niece's birthday. I'll do my best to address some of the questions left in the comments and help to clarify the specifics of my problem. Apologies in advance for my ignorance about the geometry at play here. I'm a statistician by schooling, and never did great with geometry. The circle is a region ~38.4 square km area centered around a GHCN weather station. The points inside the circle are evenly spread, and they represent locations where precipitation values were interpolated using ordinary Kriging, the height associated with each point (shown in the second picture) is the precipitation value in 10mm increments. The goal is measuring the volume of precipitation over that circular region. My initial, and what I assumed was going to be error prone, method involved dividing the total area of the circular region by the number of points in the grid, taking that value as the area for the region centered around each point. The height at this point was multiplied the the area, and all of the resulting volumes were summed. (Henning, I think this is similar to what you proposed in the comments.) However, I figured there was a better method out there that I might be able to implement in R or matlab. The object in the second picture...I got the idea to look at the squares of 4 points in the grid, the heights at each point, and using these coordinates to define a the vertices of a polyhedron. If I could compute the volume of each of these, then I can write a function to go over that grid and compute the entire volume of precipitation more accurately (I think) than the first method. The second picture was just a quick 3D plot I made in R to help visualize what one such polyhedron could look like. That was when I posted here. Studiosus- your solution seems rather promising because I think I could easily define the edges, faces, and vertices. As for reorienting them and doing the integration...do you have any resources you could point me to where I could read up on how that all works? I'm not sure I could dive in an code a function to do all of that quite yet. Heimdall and JeanMarie- this solution seems perfect, and quite easy to implement computationally. To make sure I didn't gloss over anything, I would sum the 4 heights for each 2x2 square, divide by 4, and multiply by the area of the square (as the formula given uses a unit square). Do this for each square and sum. Right? If so, this seems like my best bet. Follow up question: some boundary cases crop up where I have 3 points making a triangular base. The volume for these would be computed by slicing the object as a triangular prism, with height equal to the shortest of the 3 heights, and the remaining object would be a tetrahedron. I can compute both those volumes easily and add them together. Does this seem like a good way to handle those cases? Finally, am I gaining a lot of accuracy by employing the method given by JeanMarie and Heimdall over my initial method? Would there be a reason to pursue the solution proposed by Studiosus instead of JeanMarie and Heimdall given the context of my problem?

That is, for all but finitely many $a\in K$, $f(x)-a$ has a root. Clearly polynomials are almost surjective over any finite field, or over any algebraically closed field.  My question is whether the converse holds.  That is: If $K$ is an infinite field and polynomials are almost surjective over $K$, must $K$ be algebraically closed? ( This answer to a similar question gave a simple proof that $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed from the fact that polynomials are almost surjective over $\mathbb{C}$.  However, this proof made heavy use of special properties of $\mathbb{C}$ such as its topology, so it does not generalize to arbitrary fields.)","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'field-theory']"
1792472,Prove $A$ countable and $B$ a finite subset of A $\implies (A-B)$ is countable.,"Can someone verify this. I am confused because I am not sure if I am being asked to strictly construct a bijection or not, although that is probably the case. The thing that confuses me is that I am not sure what ""countable"" means-- even on StackExchange people will say different things. Is countable a bijection from a set to the natural numbers? Is it an injection from the natural numbers to a set? Am I supposed to talk about cardinality? Functions? What about the theorem that subsets of a countable set are countable? Let us assume $A$ is countable and $B$ is a finite subset of $A$. $A$ is countable which means it is either finite, or countably infinite. If $A$ is finite, then $(A-B)$ is clearly finite (and countable) since the difference of two finite sets is finite. If $B = \emptyset$, then $(A-B) = A$, which is countable so $(A-B)$ is countable. Let us consider the case where $A$ is countably infinite. Consider an arbitrary element $x \in (A-B).$ $\implies x \in A \land x \notin B$. So $x\in A$. It follows that $\forall x \in (A-B), x \in A \implies (A-B) \subseteq A$. We can assume $(A-B) \neq A$ because $A$ is countably infinite and $(A-B)$ is finite, so $(A-B) \subset A$. Suppose we define an injection $f$ as $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Since $(A-B) \subset A$ we can from that derive an injective function $g: (A-B) \rightarrow A$. We can compose these two injective functions as $g \circ f: (A-B) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.",['elementary-set-theory']
1792504,Formula for the number of numbers $\le n$ with same prime factors as $n$?,"Is there a more concise formula for this? I threw this one together, $\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\lfloor\frac{n^{j}}{j}\rfloor-\lfloor\frac{n^{j}-1}{j}\rfloor)(\lfloor\frac{j^{n}}{n}\rfloor-\lfloor\frac{j^{n}-1}{n}\rfloor)=$ number of numbers $\le n$ with same prime factors as $n$. I can show this by proving that the term in the left parenthesis is only $1$ or $0$ depending on whether or not $j|n^{j},$ which can only happen if the factors in prime factorization of $j$ are a subset of $n$'s. The function in the parenthesis on the right is $1$ or $0$ depending on whether or not $n|j^{n},$ which only occurs if $j$ is a multiple of $rad(n)$, the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. So, the sum counts the number of numbers $j\le n$ whose prime factorization is a subset of $n$'s and is a multiple of $rad(n)$. This leaves only those with the same factors. I give this info on the sum because people always ask, but I really just need another version. I'm looking for a different representation of this function than the one I have created above. I can't find a formula for this anywhere. Anybody got one? Example of the function is, for $n=24$, the prime factors of $24$ are $2$ and $3$. There are $4$ numbers with these factors $\le n,$ which are $(6,12,18,24),$ so the function at $24=4.$ Sequence is A008479 in oeis, but no formula.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1792755,Connection between the area of a n-sphere and the Riemann zeta function?,"The Riemann Xi-Function is defined as
$$
\xi(s) = \tfrac{1}{2} s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2} s\right) \zeta(s)
$$
and it satisfies the reflection formula
$$
\xi(s) = \xi(1-s).
$$
But the area $A$ of a $s$-dimensional sphere is 
$$
A(s) = \frac{2 \pi^{s/2}}{\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2} s\right)}
$$
so that we can write the Xi-Function like
$$
\xi(s) = s(s-1) \frac{\zeta(s)}{A(s)}.
$$
If we insert this into the reflection formula we get the following relation between the area of a n-sphere and the Riemann zeta function
$$
\frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(1-s)} = \frac{A(s)}{A(1-s)}
$$
Has this relation been noted in the literature? Why should there be such a connection between the area of a n-sphere and the zeta function? Can this relation be explained geometrically? UPDATE: I agree with the comments that negative dimensional spheres are difficult to interpret geometrically. However if we insert the formula for the area $A$ into Eulers reflection formula $$
\Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z)= \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)}
$$
we get
$$
A(1-s) = \frac{4\sin\left(\pi \frac{s+1}{2}\right)}{A(s+1)}

Inserting this into our relation with the Riemann zeta function yields
$$
\frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(1-s)} = \frac{A(s)A(s+1)}{4\sin\left(\pi \frac{s+1}{2}\right)}
