366152,Is every prime number the leg of exactly one right triangle with integer sides? What's wrong with my argument that this is impossible?,"The problem is: ""prove that every prime number is the leg of exactly one right triangle with integer sides."" However, I seem to have proved that this is impossible. What did I do wrong here? Let $p$ and $a$ be the legs of a right triangle, let $c$ be the hypotenuse, and let $p$ be prime. Then $p^2+a^2=c^2$. Now let $a=kp$ for some constant k. This now becomes $p^2+k^2p^2=c^2$, or $p^2(k^2+1)=c^2$. Since $p$ and $c$ are integers, it follows that k must be an integer as well, so $a$ is a multiple of $p$. Now take the square root: $p\sqrt{k^2+1}=c$. Again, since $p$ and $c$ are integers, $\sqrt{k^2+1}$ must then also be an integer, so $k^2+1$ must be a perfect square. However, we just showed that $k$ is itself a perfect square, and there are no two perfect squares $u$ and $v$ such that $u-v=1$. What did I do wrong here?

366363,Norm of ideals in quadratic number fields,"I do not really understand how to factor ideals in a quadratic field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, mainly because I have some trouble computing the norm of ideals. I think I understand what is going on when $I=(a)$ is principal, as it is then easy to calculate its norm (then using Legendre symbol we can determine if it's split, inert or ramified and deduce how it factorises). I have tried several methods to find the norm of an ideal of the form $(a,b)$ but they all seem to fail. For example, is it true that if $I=(a,b)$, then $N(I) \mid N(a)$ ? Because if it is true, then for example the norm of $(22,2+\sqrt{-7})$ should divide $11$ hence can only be $11$ (as it is not $1$), which is the correct answer. This method seems to work sometimes, but intuitively I would say the statement I made above is not necessarily true. Also, there is another approach which might work, but I do not know how to apply it. We know that $N(I) = | \mathcal{O}_K/I |$, which works nicely when $I$ is principal, but how can we apply this to $(22,2+\sqrt{-7})$ say ? I am also interested in any other method by the way.

366479,Contractibility of convex set,"Suppose that $\Omega$ is a convex open subset of an infinite dimensional vector space $E$ such that $\Omega$ is not contained in any finite dimensional subspace of $E$.
Let $Q_m\subset \Omega$ denote a set of $m\in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ distinct points. Question: Is the space $\Omega\setminus Q_m$ contractible? Added later: Assume that for any set $Q_m'$ of $m$ distinct points $E\setminus Q'_m$ is contractible (I believe that this is true, see my answer below). By ""blowing up $\Omega$ like a balloon"" we get a homeomorphism $\varphi$ from the convex open set $\Omega$ to $E$.
More precisely, fix $x_0\in\Omega$ and for any open interval $I\subset \mathbb{R}$ let $\varphi_I:I\to \mathbb{R}$ be a (suitable) homeomorphism.
Now, define $\varphi:\Omega \to E$ by $$\varphi(x):=\begin{cases}\varphi_{\Omega\cap \mathbb{R}\cdot (x-x_0)}(x), \text{ if } x\neq x_0 \\ x_0 , \text{ if } x= x_0.\end{cases}$$
(I know that the definition of $\varphi$ is not formally correct but I think that the idea is clear.)
Restricting $\varphi$ to $\Omega\setminus Q_m$ we get a homeomorphism between $\Omega\setminus Q_m$ and $E\setminus \varphi(Q_m)$.
By assumption $E\setminus \varphi(Q_m)$ is contractible and hence $\Omega\setminus Q_m$ is also contractible. Is the intuition behind this heuristic argument any good?
Can it be made into a complete and rigorous argument?","['general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'algebraic-topology']"

We need only count the number of permutation of the forms $

$ In the first case we see there are $6 * 5$ pairs, but we are counting each pair twice because $(12)=(21)$. Thus we divide it by $2$ getting, $15$. In the second case we have, in a similar fashion
$$
\frac{6*5}{2} *  \frac{4*3}{2}

but since disjoint cycles commute, we are counting permutation of the form $(12)(34)$ and $(34)(12)$ as distinct when they are not, so  we divide by 2 again getting: $$

$$ For the 3rd case we get 
$$
\frac{6*5}{2} *  \frac{4*3}{2} * \frac{2*1}{2}

\begin{eqnarray*}
d\omega
&=& d ( \omega_{1,2} dx^{1}\wedge dx^{2} + \omega_{1,3} dx^{1}\wedge dx^{3} + \omega_{2,3} dx^{2}\wedge dx^{3} )\\
&=& d ( \omega_{1,2} \wedge dx^{1}\wedge dx^{2} + \omega_{1,3} \wedge dx^{1}\wedge dx^{3} + \omega_{2,3} \wedge dx^{2}\wedge dx^{3} )\\
&=& d ( \omega_{1,2} \wedge dx^{1}\wedge dx^{2} ) + d ( \omega_{1,3} \wedge dx^{1}\wedge dx^{3} )+ d ( \omega_{2,3} \wedge dx^{2}\wedge dx^{3} )\\

$$ In the first step I used the fact that $\omega_{i,j}$ for $i,j\in{1,2,3}$ and $i<j$ is a 0-form which allows us to exchange the corresponding $\cdot$ by a $\wedge$. The second step follows from the linearity of $d$. The third step follows by application of the properties of the exterior derivative. If I haven't made any errors, this is as far as I get. I know the solution must be $$d\omega = d\omega_{1,2} dx^{1}\wedge dx^{2} + \omega_{1,3} dx^{1}\wedge dx^{3} + \omega_{2,3} dx^{2}\wedge dx^{3}

$$ If $\sup_n\|A_n^{-1}\|=M<\infty$ for some $M\in{\Bbb R}$, then I'm trying to show that $A$ must be invertible. What I've done is showing that $A$ is 1-1: Since $\|A_n-A\|\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$, we have
$$
\|A_nx-Ax\|\leq\|A_n-A\|\|x\|\to 0\ \ \text{as}\  n\to\infty
$$
for all $x\in X$. Hence, if $Ax=0$ then $\|A_nx\|\to 0$, i.e., for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N>0$ such that
$$
\|A_nx\|\leq \varepsilon/M

for all $n>N$. (One can show that $M>0$, so we have no problem with $1/M$). It follows that

\|x\|=\|A_n^{-1}(A_nx)\|\leq \|A_n^{-1}\|\|A_nx\|\leq M\cdot \varepsilon/M=\epsilon.

Thus $x=0$. How can I show that $A$ is also onto? [ADDED:]I suspect that one might need the assumption of completeness of $X$ and $Y$. But I don't see a quick counterexample when one of $X$ and $Y$ is not Banach space.","['operator-theory', 'normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

$$ A: D(A) \to X $$
$$  Au:= \lim_{t \to 0+} \frac{S(t)u-u}{t} $$
where $$D(A)= \{ u \in X; \lim_{t \to 0+} \frac{S(t)u-u}{t} \text{ exists in } X \}. $$ I have to prove
$$ A \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t}S(t)u dt = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t}S(t)Au dt$$
for all $u \in D(A).$ From theory i know $ S(t)u \in D(A)$, $AS(t)u = S(t)Au$, $D(A)$ is dense in $X$ and $A$ is closed. The hint in the book is to approximate the integral by a Riemann sum. Edit: 
I tried as it was suggested to me:
$$
I:=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)udt \quad \text{and} \quad J:=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)Audt.
$$ 
I have to prove $A(I)=J$. I define
$$
I_n = \int_0^{n}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)udt \quad \text{and} \quad  J_n=\int_0^{n}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)Audt.
$$
Therefore $I_n \to I$ and $J_n \to J$. I approximate $I_n$ and $J_n$ with the help of Riemann sums. Divide the interval $[0,n]$ in $k$ parts of length $\frac{n}{k}$. Function $e^{-\lambda t}$ is monotonically decreasing and thus reaches its maximum on the interval $[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}]$ at $\frac{i}{n}$. The approximation with upper Riemann sum for integral $I_n$ is 
$$
I_n = \int_0^{n}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)udt \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}S(t)u
$$
and for integral $J_n$ is
$$
J_n = \int_0^{n}e^{-\lambda t}S(t)Audt \leq \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}S(t)Au
$$
Is this OK? Then i define sequences $\{ I_{n,k} \}_k = I_{n,1},I_{n,2},\dots$ and $\{ J_{n,k} \}_k = J_{n,1},J_{n,2},\dots$ where 
$$
I_{n,k} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}S(t)u
$$
and
$$
J_{n,k} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}S(t)Au
$$
Then $I_{n,k} \to I_{n}$ when $k \to \infty$ and $J_{n,k} \to J_{n}$ when $k \to \infty$. Here i also struggle...Is the following true?
$$
A(I_{n,k}) = A(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}S(t)u) = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{n}{k} e^{-\lambda(i-1)\frac{n}{k}}\max_{t \in [(i-1)\frac{n}{k},i\frac{n}{k}]}AS(t)u
$$
I know $A$ is linear ($Au=\lim_{t\to 0+} \frac{S(t)u-u}{t}$) but what can i do with the $\max$? I then use a proven fact in the book, $AS(t)u = S(t)Au$ to get $A(I_{n,k}) = J_{n,k}$.
I have $A(I_{n,k}) \to J_n$ and since $A$ is closed i have $A(I_n) = J_n$. Therefore $A(I_n) \to J$. Using again closedness of $A$ i conclude $A(I)=J$.","['operator-theory', 'measure-theory', 'calculus', 'functional-analysis']"

Let $\gamma : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be a path from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$. First of all, I will show we may take WLOG $\gamma$ to be injective. Consider a point $\alpha = (p, q) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$. Consider the set $S = \{x \in [a, b]; \gamma(x) = \alpha\}$, which we suppose non-empty. Let $c = \inf S$, $c' = \sup S$. By the continuity of $\gamma$, we have $\gamma(c) = \gamma(c') = \alpha$. We may now consider the equivalence relation $\sim$ on $[a, b]$ which sets $x \sim x$ and $z \sim y$ for $z, y \in [c, c']$. The quotient space $[a, b] / \sim$ is homeomorphic to an interval (since $a < c \leq c' < b$, by the continuity of $\gamma$), and the induced map $\bar{\gamma} : [a, b] / \sim \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ may be taken as a path which passes through $\alpha$ only once. Since $[a, b]$ is compact and $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is Hausdorff, $\gamma$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. Clearly $\gamma([a, b]) \subset G(f)$. We must now show this is an equality, which is done via the intermediate value theorem. Consider $\pi_{1} : G(f) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to be the projection onto the first coordinate, which is continuous. Consider $\phi = \pi_{1} \circ \gamma : [a, b] \rightarrow [a, b]$, which also is continuous. Since $\phi(a) = a, \phi(b) = b$, $\phi([a, b]) = [a, b]$, and therefore $\gamma([a, b]) = G(f)$. Thus $f$ is a function whose graph is homeomorphic to its domain. We will show in the next paragraph that this implies the continuity of $f$. Indeed, suppose $g : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has a homeomorphism $H : [a, b] \rightarrow G(g)$. This induces a map $T : [a, b] \rightarrow [a, b]$ such that $H(x) = (T(x), g(T(x))$. We note $T$ is continuous since $T = \pi_{1} \circ H$. It is clearly seen $T$ is bijective, and thus a homeomorphism since [a, b] is compact and Hausdorff. Since $g \circ T$ is continuous, $g \circ T \circ T^{-1} = g$ also is.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

To be fair, I'm not a math major and might just not be using the right search queries. I'm working on a system for outdoor WiFi localization. My experimental data suggests that using the RSSI (received signal strength) gives enough accuracy for the resolution we need, which is where the math - and you good folks - come in. I'd like to use trilateration to find a device's location, possibly using more than 3 beacons with known locations. With the variability of the RSSI at a given distance it is highly unlikely that trilateration will produce circles with a single common intersection. As such, I need to be able to calculate the point in 2D space that is closest to the edges of all 3+ circles. At the moment I am coding in python, if that makes a difference to anyone. What are my options? Thanks!",['geometry']

Prove $T = I$. I tried to prove it the following way: $T$ is normal $\Rightarrow V$ has an orthonormal basis consisting of characteristic vectors of $T$ $T$ is unitary $\Rightarrow$ every characteristic value $|\lambda| = 1$. To get a contradiction, assume that there exists some characteristic value $\lambda = -1$. $\Rightarrow$  there is a vector $v \in V $ that $T(v) = -v$ and  $v$ is not zero looking on the inner product: $\langle T(v),v\rangle \  =\  \langle -v,v\rangle \  =\ -\langle v,v\rangle $ and $ \ \langle v,v\rangle \  = \ ||v||^2 > 0$  so $\ \langle T(v), v\rangle \  < \ 0$ and this contradicts the fact that $T$ is positive. $\Rightarrow$ all the characteristic values $\lambda_i = 1$.

I know that these results follow directly from this result: If $R$ is a finitely generated $k$ -algebra ( $k$ maybe not algebraically closed) and $R$ is a field, then $R/k$ is an algebraic extension (which I think that's anti-intuitive too and all the proofs that I found seems very unnatural).

(Varieties in this book are taken to be over $\mathbb{C}$.) I was wondering why this is true, since the Zariski topology is coarser than the Euclidean topology.  Can someone sketch a proof of this fact?  Smith offers no explanation for this. Partly I think I'm confused about the notion of ""Euclidean topology"" on projective space.  There are at least two topologies that could be considered the ""Euclidean topology"", and I hope they're the same: The standard affine cover of $\mathbb{P}^n$ gives rise to charts where the open sets are affine $n$-space $\mathbb{C}^n$.   If $\mathbb{C}^n$ is equipped with the Euclidean topology, this makes $\mathbb{P}^n$ a complex manifold. There is a surjective map from $\pi: \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{P}^n$ that identifies lines given by $\pi(z_0,\ldots,z_n) = [z_0:\cdots:z_n]$.  If $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is given the Euclidean topology, then $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be given the quotient topology.  This should be the same as declaring that a set $V$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is closed iff its affine cone $\pi^{-1}(V) \cup \{0\}$ is closed in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with the Euclidean topology.

366977,Discreteness of eigenvalues for certain operators - can this approach be made rigorous?,"I was idly thinking about why one might naïvely expect a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues for a linear operator $L$ when I dreamt up the following argument (which I expect isn't new instead - references?). Can it be made rigorous , with any necessary added restrictions, or does it at least offer some genuine informal insight? (Or did I just mess something up?) Suppose $L$ is a linear, self-adjoint operator acting on (sufficiently) continuously differentiable functions  $\phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ with boundary conditions $\phi(0)=\phi(1)=0$. An eigenfunction $\phi_\lambda(x)$ is a non-zero such function such that $$\left[L \phi_\lambda\right](x) = \lambda \phi_\lambda(x)$$ We expect that such functions occur only for 'discrete' $\lambda$, in particular not for an interval $(a,b)$ of eigenvalues. Clarification : I'm thinking of $L$ being a 'nice' integral/differential operator in my head. What I'm interested in is what further restrictions are necessary to make the spectrum simple. Here's a reason to suspect this is the case: suppose $\phi\equiv \phi(x;\lambda)$ is a (sufficiently) continuously differentiable function $[0,1]\times(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $L \phi = \lambda\phi$. Suppose further that $L,\phi$ is sufficiently nicely behaved that $L (\partial_\lambda \phi) \equiv \partial_\lambda(L\phi)$. Note that we expect $\partial_\lambda \phi|_{x=0,1}=0$ since all $\phi$ obey the boundary conditions, so $L$ should be self-adjoint on this function too. Then, with a simple $L^2$ inner product $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>$ say, $$\boxed{\lambda \left<\phi,\partial_\lambda \phi\right> = \left<L\phi,\partial_\lambda \phi\right> = \left<\phi,L\partial_\lambda \phi\right> = \left<\phi,\partial_\lambda L\phi\right> = \left<\phi,\partial_\lambda (\lambda\phi)\right> = \left<\phi,\phi\right> + \lambda \left<\phi,\partial_\lambda \phi\right>}$$ and hence
$$\left<\phi,\phi\right> = 0$$ Hence there is no continuously differentiable family of solutions which vary the eigenvalue throughout some interval. Example By contrast, if we dropped our boundary conditions and worked on the fully infinite domain $x\in(-\infty,\infty)$ the operator $Lf=f''(x)$ acquires all real eigenvalues on the smooth families $\cos kx,\exp kx$. But for s finite interval with homogeneous BCs, we only get e.g. $0,\pi,2\pi,\ldots$ Any interesting thoughts are welcome! I haven't thought about this in great detail, so it may be that this just leads to a standard spectral theory argument when one tries to make it rigorous, but I'm curious as to whether it has an interesting interpretation, and whether you think it would be a good, informal justification to teach someone first coming to Sturm-Liouville theory. Mainly, I am interested in whether this can be tweaked to a proof without losing all the simple spirit of the boxed equation above.","['reference-request', 'intuition', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The equivalent in polygons produces the regular polygons, and can be considered a property of regular polygons. However, as we all know, there are only five ""regular polyhedra"" (not counting the star polyhedra), the platonic solids. I expect that these five solids maximise for either their respective numbers of faces or vertices (probably not both, as that would result in the dodecahedron and icosahedron having identical volume for the same surface area, which seems counterintuitive), but I'm interested in what the maximising shape would be for, for instance, a pentahedron.","['geometry', 'terminology', 'polyhedra']"

At least one coefficient of $f$ when viewed this way is non-zero. Now $f$ has at most $m$ roots, since its single indeterminate, $x_1$, has exponent at most $m$. For each of these $m$ roots $y_{1,1}, y_{1,2}, \dots, y_{1,m}$ and any $x_2, \dots, x_n$, $f(y_{1,j}, x_2, \dots, x_n) = 0$. There are $m k^{n-1}$ tuples of this form, where $k$ is the size of $K$.

Note that the family of sampling distributions is a regular version of $\Pi\left(\pi_\Omega\in\cdot\mid\pi_\Theta=\theta\right)$. A $\left(\Gamma,\mathcal{G}\right)$-statistic, where $\left(\Gamma,\mathcal{G}\right)$ is a measurable space, is a measurable function $T:\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A}\right)\rightarrow\left(\Gamma,\mathcal{G}\right)$. Set $\mathcal{T}:=\sigma(T)$. Bayesian Sufficiency According to Schervish ([SCH], Lemma 2.6), $\mathcal{T}$ is Bayes sufficient iff for every prior $Q$ there exists a (not necessarily regular) version $\mu:\Omega\times\mathcal{F}\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ of the posterior, such that for all $F\in\mathcal{F}$, $\mu\left(\cdot,F\right)$ is $\mathcal{T}/\mathfrak{B}$-measurable ($\mathfrak{B}$ being the standard Borel field on the real line). According to Nogales, Oyola & Perez ([NOG] at the end of page 76), $\mathcal{T}$ is Bayes sufficient for a given prior $Q$ iff $\mathcal{F}\perp_\mathcal{T}\mathcal{A}$ in $S_Q$ (""$\cdot\perp_\square\cdot$"" being the symbol for conditional stochastic independence). Here $\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are considered as sub-$\sigma$-fields of $\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{A}$ through their identification with $\left\{F\times\Omega:F\in\mathcal{F}\right\}$, $\left\{\Theta\times A:A\in\mathcal{A}\right\}$ and $\left\{\Theta\times A:A\in\mathcal{T}\right\}$, respectively.

367155,Why is the graph of a continuous function to a Hausdorff space closed? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is the graph $G_f=\{(x,f(x)) \in X \times Y\ : x \in X \}$ a closed subset of $X \times Y$? (3 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Say I have two topological spaces given by $(X,\mathscr{T}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathscr{T}_Y)$ where $Y$ is Hausdorff. In addition say I have a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$, and let it be continuous. I want to show that $Gr(f):=\{(x,f(x))\mid x\in X\}$ is a closed subset of $(X\times Y)$. In answering this question, could you also provide the ""chain of thought"" that brought you to the solution. I am aware of what the continuity of the function and the fact that $Y$ is Hausdorff provides me in terms of definition. I am however, finding it hard to find a -link- towards answering the question. Thank you all in advance for your help.","['general-topology', 'analysis']"
367159,Integrating $\sqrt{\cos(x)}$,I need to calculate the area between $y=0$ and $y=\sqrt{\cos(x)}$ between $x=\frac{\pi}{4}$ $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$. I tried integrating $\displaystyle \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sqrt{\cos(x)}dx$ but it I don't know how. I tried letting $r=tg(x/2)$ but seems that doesn't help. Also I tried changing it to $\displaystyle \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sqrt{\cos(x)}\frac{\sin(x)}{\sin(x)}dx$ and integrate by substitiution but that didn't work either. How can I integrate this expression?,"['calculus', 'integration']"
