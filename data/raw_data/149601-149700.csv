2481107,Calculating distribution related to hitting time.,"Let $\xi_1, \xi_2,\cdots$ be i.i.d. random elements  with distribution $\mu$ in some measurable space $(S,\mathcal S)$, fix a set $A\in \mathcal S$ with $\mu A >0$, put $\tau$ = $\inf\{k; \xi_k \in A \}$ (the first hitting time). Show that $\xi_\tau$ has distribution $\mu[\cdot|A]=\mu[\cdot\cap A]/\mu A$. Intuitively, $\xi_\tau\in B \Leftrightarrow \xi_\tau \in A\cap B$, since $\xi_i$ are all i.i.d., we can intuitively call them $\xi$, its distribution is then  $P\{\xi_\tau \in B\} = P\{\xi\in B|\xi \in A\}=\mu[B\cap A]/\mu A$. But I don't know how to argue it rigorously, by definition $\xi_i$ and $\xi_j$ have identical distributions only means $P\{\xi_i\in B\} = P\{\xi_j\in B\}$. (I also accept answers that totally unrelated to my argument.) BTW, is it by definition $\xi_\tau(w)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \xi_k(w)$ if $\tau(w) = \infty$? But it becomes strange as $S$ is just a space hence we don't know what the $\lim$ means. (Though in this problem we could ignore it because it simply makes $\xi_\tau(w) \notin B$, so basically anyone answering this question could ignore this minor bug unless it's important in the answer.)","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
2481110,Produce a differential equation from the family of curves $x=a\cdot \sin(t+b)$,"I'm trying to produce a differential equation from the family of curves:$$x=a\cdot \sin(t+b), ~a,b\in \mathbb{R}$$ I differentiated once with respect to $t$, here $x$ is a function of $t$:

2481163,"Is there a way to determine the summation of all ""even"" elements of an infinite geometric sequence?*","*Algebraically and not with by adding them for the first 100 or whatever and estimating This came up when I came across a question in my probability class where I was asked about a game where 2 players take turns to accomplish a task until one succeeds. Each attempt has a probability of $p = x$ for success (I'm using $x$ so it's general, but in my case, I got .35)
This makes a geometric series of $x(1-x)^{(n-1)}$ for $n$ being a positive integer where $n$ equals nth attempt. 
The question asked was what's the probability the first player wins, I wrote it as: $$\lim_{t\to \infty} \sum_{k=0}^{t}x*(x-1)^{2k}$$ Is there any way to solve this algebraically or something else or do I have to rely on computers for this task?

Now what about topological spaces in general? Manifolds are locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$, but perhaps for some of them there exist special fundamental systems (different from charts) that satisfy the condition.

2481302,Abelianisation of a division ring,"I was reading a paper recently concerning a non-commutative version of the matrix determinant. On the third page, it stated a fact without providing a proof or a reference: If $D$ is a division ring, let $D^\times$ be its multiplicative group, then the abelianisation of $D^\times$, $\frac{D^\times}{[D^\times,D^\times]}$, is isomorphic to $Z(D)^\times$ - the centre of $D^\times$. This result doesn't seem at all trivial, although of course it holds for any commutative field. I had considered that perhaps the natural map $Z(D)^\times\to \frac{D^\times}{[D^\times,D^\times]},c\mapsto c [D^\times,D^\times]$ could be proved to be an isomorphism. But I can see no reason why this should be be the case. Is this result really true? If so, does anyone have any idea why?

$\newcommand{\CR}{\mathcal{C}\left(\RR\right)}$ There are as many continuous functions than real numbers: $\left|\left\{f, f:\CR \rightarrow \RR\right\}\right|=|\RR|$ . It is easy, for a machine, to approximately scroll over every real number from $\text{-}\infty$ to $\text{+}\infty$, provided we choose arbitrary, finite bounds and an arbitrary, finite precision . (btw cheers, Turing ;) Since there are bijections between $\CR$ and $\RR$, is there not, similarly, a natural way to scroll over $\CR$? How would these —necessary— choices of ""bounds and precision"" translate? My guess is that there may be many possible approaches (scroll over polynomials coefficients and degrees, over coefficients of periodic functions and the length of their sum, etc. ), but then.. How come this problem seems more difficult than just $\textit{spanning}\ \RR$ since $\RR$ and $\CR$ are equipotent? How come it seems to need more variables and more arbitrary choices? [EDIT:] as suggested in the comments, here would be the requirements for such a ""natural scrolling"": Let $s:\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\RR \to \CR \\

2481386,"What are ""multi-images"" really called, and where can I learn more about them?","Given a function $f : A \rightarrow B$, between finite sets, there is a multiset induced on $B$ by declaring the multiplicity of $b \in B$ to be the cardinality of $f^{-1}(b).$ For argument's sake, lets call this the multi-image of $f$. Multi-images can also be defined in a more algebraic way. Given a function $f : A \rightarrow B$, we get an induced function $\mathbb{N}\langle f \rangle : \mathbb{N}\langle A \rangle \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\langle B\rangle$ by assuming $\mathbb{N}$-linearity and agreement with $f$ when restricted to $A$. Then the multi-image of $f$ is $$\mathbb{N}\langle f\rangle \left(\sum_{a \in A} \langle a \rangle\right).$$ This sum makes sense because $A$ is finite. Abusing notation a bit, we can write $f$ instead of $\mathbb{N}\langle f \rangle$, and we can write $A$ in place of that sum, in which case the multi-image can be denoted $f(A)$, so long as we tell the reader what we're doing. Furthermore, if we allow multisets to be infinite, we don't have to assume that $A$ and $B$ are finite. At this level of generality, the above paragraph continues to make sense, so long as we replace commutative monoids with complete monoids , replacing ordinary linearity with infinitary linearity, and replacing the initial semiring $\mathbb{N}$ with the initial monoid object in the category of complete monoids . The multi-image construction can be seen as a de-categorification of the operation that replaces each function $f : A \rightarrow B$ with the corresponding slice of $B$. Now in my opinion, multi-images are a very natural construction. For example, injectivity and surjectivity can be decided from the multi-image alone (compare with ordinary images, which can only detect surjectivity.) However, I can't find any information about them online, and the term ""multi-image"" seems not to get any hits. Question. Do multi-images have an accepted name, and if so, where can I learn more about them? For example, I'd be interested in seeing uses of multi-images in combinatorics, where remembering the number of ways something can happen is a desirable feature.","['semiring', 'terminology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'category-theory', 'combinatorics']"

2481528,Normalizing a semi-normalized Schauder basis,"Here's something that is probably obvious but I can't seem to see it. Suppose $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a Schauder basis for a Banach space $X$, ""seminormalized"" in the sense that we have
$$0<\inf\|x_n\|\leq\sup\|x_n\|<\infty.$$
Now consider the corresponding normalized basis formed by setting
$$y_n=\frac{x_n}{\|x_n\|},\quad n\in\mathbb{N}.$$ Recall that two Schauder bases $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(y_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ are said to be equivalent whenever there is a constant $C\in[1,\infty)$ satisfying the property
$$C^{-1}\left\|\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_ny_n\right\| \leq \left\|\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nx_n\right\| \leq C\left\|\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_ny_n\right\| \qquad \forall\,(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty\in c_{00},$$

The principle of small perturbations guarantees that they have equivalent basic subsequences, but this is not enough.  I want the original bases themselves to be equivalent. It's also easy to see that they are equivalent whenever they are unconditional.  However, again, this is not enough for me.  I want equivalence to be guaranteed even when the bases are conditional. If the answer to Question #1 above is negative, then: Question #2. What is a specific counter-example to question #1?

2481592,Step Function vs Simple Function,"Unfortunately, my book (Royden-Fitzpatrick's Real Analysis) offers no definition of a step function but merely compares its role in Riemann integration to the role played by linear combinations of characteristic functions in Lebesgue integration. From what I gather, these are simple function in which he defines as follows: A real-valued function $\varphi$ is defined on a measurable set $E$ is simple provided it is measurable and takes only a finite number of values. This means that $\varphi = \sum_{i=1}^n c_k \chi_{E_k}$ where $E_k = \{x \in E \mid \varphi(x) = c_k\}$ However, here and here the step function is defined in the very same way, the only difference being that the $E_k$ are taken to be intervals.  But I have read elsewhere that the set of step functions and simple functions do not coincide. What am I misunderstanding? The reason I ask is because the following problem I am working could be rendered trivial depending on how one interprets these terms (at least it seems it could be): Let $I$ be a closed, bounded interval and $E$ a measurable subset of $I$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Show that there is a step function $h$ on $I$ and a measurable subset $F$ of $I$ for which $h = \chi_E$ on $F$ and $m(I-F) < \epsilon$.

2481593,"Why is this vector field not conservative, even though it has a potential? (what is the actual definition of a conservative vector field?)","My question is really ''what is the definition of a conservative vector field''? I've consulted 3 textbooks that all say a vector field $\vec{F}$ is conservative by definition if there exists a scalar potential $\phi$ such that $\nabla \phi = \vec{F}$. Then, they go on to talk about connected domains, path independence and the equality of mixed partials and how they are all related. In particular, they emphasize that e.g. in $\mathbb{R}^2$ given $\vec{F} = \bigl<F_1,\,F_2\bigr>$, if $\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}$ on a simply-connected domain, then $\vec{F}$ is conservative on that domain. However, without fail, all of them then offer the example of $\vec{F} = \bigl< \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2},\, \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} \bigr>$, pointing out: it's line integral is not path independent, even though $\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}$ and this is explained by pointing out that the domain is not simply connected (if the path contains the origin). That much makes sense to me: we cannot conclude $\vec{F}$ is conservative based on the partial derivatives, because the domain is not simply connected - totally consistent with what has been presented. What none of them address is why $\vec{F} = \bigl< \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2},\, \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} \bigr>$ is not conservative when there exists a potential $\phi = \arctan(y/x)$ such that $\nabla \phi = \vec{F}$ .

2481918,Closed form of distance travelled by each corner of a rectangle that is simultaneously rotated and translated,"Motivation, Background, and Research I'm a programmer for an FRC robotics team. We use a holonomic drivetrain called Swerve, wherein each wheel is independently rotated and driven. During our journey through this season, we've come across several interesting math problems, mostly rooted in trigonometry. This is a question we've managed to sidestep so far, by changing the way we've approached some problems. However, I'm still curious about it, even if we never end up needing to know. Inverse kinematics and other information for the Swerve drivetrain can be found here . TL;DR: I might be overthinking this. I know there are formulas for setting wheel velocities and headings in the white paper (derivation for rectangular case here ) at the linked page. However, I can't tell if they produce the desired behavior exactly. It may be as simple as integrating the velocities over the necessary time, but I'm not sure. We use a combination of these formulas and path tracking that currently uses the robot's center position, calculated by averaging the recorded positions of each wheel module. We can calculate where we've been, but I'd like a closed-form solution for any translation and rotation. This would allow us to follow per-wheel paths more precisely. I'm taking Calculus II right now, and frankly I expect that the answer(s) will be over my head. That's fine with me—I'll just keep learning until I understand. I have done some searching about loci, arc length, parametric functions, and translations, but I haven't been able to find anything about this specific problem. Problem A note on the angles used in this question: For whatever reason, the angles used in Swerve kinematics are wonky from a math standpoint. They're similar to the headings on a compass, though: $0^\circ$ in normal math corresponds to $90^\circ$ in Swerve math, and vice versa. Positive angles are clockwise. Consider a rectangle with a center point $R$ , initial rotation $\alpha$ , width $W$ , and length $L$ . We want to translate the rectangle by a vector $V = \left<\Delta x,\Delta y\right>$ and rotate it by an angle $\Delta\alpha$ about its center. Both transformations take place over the same period of time and at constant rates. That is, if it takes 10 seconds to perform this motion, then at 5 seconds, the rectangle's center is halfway to its final destination, and its rotation is halfway between where it was and where it will be. The center $R_i$ will always lie on the segment $\overline{RR'}$ . I've built a Geogebra model here . Question What is the distance travelled by each vertex of the rectangle?","['locus', 'arc-length', 'geometry']"

2482072,"What functions can be made continuous by ""mixing up their domain""?","Definition . A function $f:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ will be called potentially continuous if there is a bijection $\phi:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ such that $f\circ \phi$ is continuous. So one could say a potentially continuous (p.c.) function is ""a continuous function with a mixed up domain"". I was wondering whether there is an easy way to characterize such functions. Some thoughts $\DeclareMathOperator{\im}{im}$ If the image $\im(f)$ is not connected (i.e. no interval), then $f$ is not p.c. because even mixing the domain cannot make $f$ satisfy the intermediate value theorem. Bijective functions are always p.c. because we can choose $\phi=f^{-1}$ . Every injective function with an open connected image is p.c. for a similar reason. However, only having a connected image is not enough, as e.g. there are bijections, but no continuous bijections $f:\Bbb R \to [0,1]$ . Initially I thought a function can never be p.c. if it attains every value (or at least uncountably many values) uncountably often, e.g. like Conways base 13 function . But then I discovered this: take a Peano curve like function $c$ (or any other continuous surjection $\Bbb R\to\Bbb R^2$ ) and only look at the $x$ -component $c_x:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ . This is a continuous function which attains every value uncountably often. The question can also be asked this way. Given a family of pairs $(r_i,\kappa_i),i\in I$ of real numbers $r_i$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa_i\le\mathfrak c$ so that $\{r_i\mid i\in I\}$ is connected. Can we find a continuous function $f:\Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ with $|f^{-1}(r_i)|=\kappa_i$ ? There is no continuous function which attains each real number exactly once except zero which is attained twice. So, e.g. the function $$f(x)=\begin{cases}x-1&\text{for $x\in\Bbb N$}\\x&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ is not p.c., even though its image is all of $\Bbb R$ .","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'functions']"

And we can define $f$, $g$, $h$ by induction in such way that we make sure that after $n$-th step: a) $f$ and $g$ are defined for the integers from some set $A_n$; b) $f$, $g$ and $h=f+g$ are injective on $A_n$; c) $z_n\in A_n$; d) $z_n$ belongs to $f[A_n]$, $g[A_n]$, $h[A_n]$.

2482776,Connection on vector bundle : Prove that $(\nabla_X Y)(p)=0$ if $X(p)=0$.,"Recently i tried to learn more about connection using Jeffrey Lee's book Manifolds and Differential Geometry (i already read John Lee's Riemannian Manifolds before). After several pages in Jeffrey Lee's book (proposition 12.5), i realized maybe some step missing from a proof about connection in Lemma 4.2 in John Lee's book Riemannian Manifold. And i think its quite confusing for a beginner like me. Here is the lemma 4.2 in John Lee's Riemannian Manifold : $\textbf{Lemma}.$Let $E \rightarrow M$ be a vector bundle over $M$ and $\nabla : \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \Gamma(E) \rightarrow \Gamma(E)$ be a connection on $E$. For any $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $Y \in \Gamma(E)$ and $p \in M$, the value $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ only depends on the value of $X$ at $p$ and the value of $Y$ in neighbourhood of $p$. The second claim is fine. What i'm worried about is the first claim. That is $(\nabla_X Y)(p)$ depends on $X$ at $p$. This is the proof from the book : $\textbf{Proof}$ By linearity it is sufficient to show that $(\nabla_XY)(p)=0$ whenever $X_p=0$. Choose a coordinate neighbourhood of $p$ and write $X=X^i \partial_i$ in coordinates on $U$, with $X^i(p)=0$, then
$$
(\nabla_XY)(p) = (\nabla_{X^i\partial_i} Y)(p) = X^i(p) (\nabla_{\partial_i}Y)(p) = 0 . (\nabla_{\partial_i}Y)(p) = 0
$$
The first equality, we used lemma $4.1$, which allows us to evaluate $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ by computing locally in $U$; the second , we used linearity of $\nabla$ over $C^{\infty}(M)$in $X$. $\qquad$ $\square$ What bug me is that the argument involving lemma 4.1 which is we can evaluate $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ locally in $U$. Lemma 4.1 says that $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ just depends on the value of $X$ in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of $p$. I don't see why this is implies that we can evaluate $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ locally in $U$. For any ways, the first argument for $\nabla$ must be a global section $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$, so we can't replace $X$ in $(\nabla_XY)(p)$ with $X=X^i \partial_i$, because  $X=X^i \partial_i$ is just local expression of $X$ in $U$. This is different from Jeffrey Lee's approach which is by definition of $\textbf{natural covariant derivatives}$ first before proving above statement, which i found more a bit more clear. Anyone can help me with this ? any help will be appreciated. Thanks.","['smooth-manifolds', 'connections', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}S_n =S$. Assume all $X_n \geq 0 $. Show that $\mathbb{E}(\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\mathbb{E}(X_k)$ using the Monotone Convergence Theorem. b) Drop the assumption that $X_n$ is non-negative. Show $\mathbb{E}(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|X_k|)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(|X_k|)$ My attempt to answer part a): Since $X_n \geq0$, we have that $0\leq S_1\leq S_2 \leq \cdots \text{ a.s.}$
Then according to the Monotone Convergence Theorem we have that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}(S_n)=\mathbb{E}(S)$. So now we get that: $$\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_k\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E} \left(\sum_{k=1}^n X_k\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{E}(S_n)=\mathbb{E}(S) =\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}(X_k) =\sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{E}(X_k) $$ I'm not quite sure whether this answer for question a) is correct.

I would also define $S^{+}_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X^{+}_k$ and $S^{-}_n =\sum_{k=1}^n X^{-}_k$.

Working in a secondary school class on random walks that could only head in two directions (e.g., South and West) we stumbled upon the following summation to be evaluated: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{2^n}$$ We were able to ""solve"" this in three ways: using some probabilistic intuition, plugging the formula directly into Mathematica/Wolfram Alpha, and using the identity: $$\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots$$ differentiated a few times over to find (verification pasted from Wolfram Alpha): after which plugging in $x = 1/2$ gives roughly the series about which we were curious. Another instructor was able to tinker with the above-mentioned series and figure out a closed form for the $m$th partial sums, which could then be verified by induction (after which taking the limit as $m \rightarrow \infty$ resolves the matter). In fact, Wolfram Alpha produces the closed form for this partial sum immediately upon input. For example, inputting the series above yields: Question: Given an infinite series that consists of the ratio of a polynomial in $n$ (numerator) to a constant raised to some power that is linear in $n$ (denominator) what is a general technique to produce the closed formula corresponding to the series' $m$th partial sums? Given the context, material at the level of strong secondary mathematics (or early undergraduate mathematics) would be ideal, but mathematics at any level - references, related problems and/or solutions, and extensions - are all welcome, too. I would especially appreciate answers that ""fill in"" all details, e.g., by including a worked example, so as to make this post more pedagogically effective in a self-contained manner.","['random-walk', 'reference-request', 'generating-functions', 'power-series', 'sequences-and-series']"

2483544,Proof that $\mathbf{R}^n$ has a countable base.,"I'm a high school student self-studying analysis, and I'm reading Apostol's book. I wrote a proof that shows that $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a countable base, but am unsure if it is correct. I just wanted some feedback on it. Thanks! Prove that $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a countable base. Proof. We construct an open cover $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$ by considering the union of all neighborhoods with rational centers and rational radii, namely $$\{V_{\alpha}\} = \{ N_q(n):q, n \in \mathbb{Q} \}$$ Pick an arbitrary $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , and take an arbitrary open set $S$ such that $x \in S.$ Since $S$ is open, there must be a neighborhood $N_{\epsilon}(x)$ with radius $\epsilon$ about $x$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(x) \subset S$ . Take point $j \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ such that $d(j,x) < \frac{\epsilon}{100}$ , which exists since $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ Now, take $k \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that $ \frac{\epsilon}{100} < k < \frac{\epsilon}{10}$ . Therefore, $N_k(j) \in \{V_{\alpha}\}$ . Clearly, $$x \in N_k(j) \subset N_{\epsilon}(x) \subset S.$$ $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is thus a base. $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is countable, since it is a union of a countable collection of countable sets. Thus, $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is a countable base.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

Conceptually, the sine component oscillates wildly around that interval and the fractional component $x^2-2x$ seems to approach infinity around $a=0$ and $a=2$.

2483581,Questions about bases in topology,"I have some questions regarding bases in topology. There are different ways of defining a topology and I want to distinguish between them. Let $X$ be a topological space. A collection $\mathcal{B}\subseteq 2^{X}$ is called a basis for the topology on X if the following are satisfied: 1) Every element of $\mathcal{B}$ is an open subset of $X$. 2) Every open subset of $X$ is the union of some collection of elements of $\mathcal{B}$. Let $X$ be a set, and suppose $\mathcal{B}\subseteq 2^{X}$. Then $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for some topology on $X$ iff it satisfies the following: 1) $\bigcup\limits_{B\in\mathcal{B}}B=X$ 2) If $B_1,B_2\in\mathcal{B}$ and $x\in B_1\cap B_2$, then there exists an element $B_3\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_3 \subseteq B_1\cap B_2$. When asked to prove that a set is a basis for the topology on a top. space $X$, we should use the first definition. However, in this case, do we need to also show the ""basis criterion?"" (Basis Criterion) Suppose $X$ is a topological space, and $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for its topology. Show that a subset $U\subseteq X$ is open iff it satisfies the following condition: For every $x\in U$, there exists $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U$. When should we used the second definition (proposition)?",['general-topology']

2483675,Finding All n-regular graphs on m vertices,"So I am studying for an exam on Discrete Mathematics coming up in a few weeks, when looking past papers it seems that my lecturer enjoys asking questions of the form ""Find all n-regular graphs on m vertices. Justify your answer."" Where he will replace m and n with actual numbers rather than having us deal with the arbitrary case. However, these questions take me ages since I create, for a fixed m and n, all the n-regular graphs on m vertices that I can think of, check that they are not isomorphic and hope i have found all of them.  Is there a better way of approaching this question? For example; 'Find all 5-regular graphs on 8 vertices.' Any help is appreciated.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2483723,"$O_X$ is structural sheaf of affine scheme $X=Spec A$. Then $p\in Spec A$, $A_p\otimes O_X(U)\cong A_p$ for $p\in U\subset X$ as open subset","Let $X=Spec A$ be affine scheme. Then $O_{X,p}\cong A_p$ for $p\in Spec A$ and taking any $f\not\in p$, I have $A_f\otimes_{A_f}A_p\cong A_p$ as $A_f$ module. In particular $A_f=O_X(D(f))$. My guess is that $O_X(D(f))\otimes_{A_f}A_p\cong A_p$ and $O_X(U)\otimes_{A_f}(A_p)=A_p$ for any open $U\subset D(f)$. $D(f)$ denotes basis of the topology. Q1: Is the above assertion true? My guess is that $O_X(D(f))\to O_X(U)\to O_{X,p}$ is the module morphism I would like to consider. However, I did not figure out why $O_X(U)\otimes_{A_f}A_p\cong A_p$ should be the case. Q2. If above is true, how do I prove it? If $O_X$ is flasque, then it surely holds. Under what circumstances, can I conclude that it holds? Q3. Does it hold in general scheme construction?","['schemes', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Then it can be proved using Liouville's theorem that $$f(z, a) =\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{a^{n}} {z+n} +\frac{a^{-n}} {z-n}\right)=2\pi i\cdot\frac{a^{-z}} {1-\exp(-2\pi iz)}, z\neq 0$$ Is there any other way to prove this preferably using some general techniques for summation of a series? For $a=1$ it is easy to see that $f(z, a) =\pi\cot\pi z$ (based on infinite product of $\sin\pi z$) and I am expecting some similar approach which works for $a\neq 1$. Note : For the uninitiated the above identity is crucial to the proof of Kronecker's second limit formula . Apart from this step the formula involves nothing but simple algebraic manipulation and is thus at the same level as the above identity. My interest in Kronecker's formula ignited due to this question .",['sequences-and-series']
