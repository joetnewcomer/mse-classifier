2973198,"Proving that $\frac{D(a,b,c)}{D(x,y,z)}=1$","In deriving continuity equations using Lagrangian . We consider the element of fluid which occupied a rectangular parallelopiped having its centre at the point $(a,b,c)$ and its edges $\delta a$ , $\delta b$ , $\delta c $ parallel to the axes . At the time $t$ the same element for an oblique parallelepiped . The centre now has for its co-ordinates $x$ , $y$ , $z$ ; and the projections of the edges on the co-ordinate axes are respectively $$ \frac{\partial x}{\partial a} \delta a \ , \ \frac{\partial y}{\partial a} \delta a \ , \ \frac{\partial z}{\partial c} \delta a$$ $$\frac{\partial x}{\partial b} \delta b \ , \ \frac{\partial y}{\partial b} \delta b \ , \ \frac{\partial z}{\partial b} \delta b$$ $$\frac{\partial x}{\partial c} \delta c \ , \ \frac{\partial y}{\partial c} \delta c \ , \ \frac{\partial z}{\partial c} \delta c$$ How can i get these projections ?
The volume of the parallelepiped is therefore $$\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial a} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial a} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial a} \\ 
\frac{\partial x}{\partial b} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial b} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial b} \\ 
\frac{\partial x}{\partial c} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial c} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial c}
\end{vmatrix} \delta a \delta b \delta c$$ or as its often written $$\frac{D(x,y,z)}{D(a,b,c)} \delta a \delta b \delta c$$ since the fluid mass is unchanged and the fluid is incompressible we have $$\frac{D(x,y,z)}{D(a,b,c)} =1$$ Is there a way to prove that $$\frac{D(a,b,c)}{D(x,y,z)}= 1$$ without expanding the determinant ?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'vector-spaces', 'fluid-dynamics']"
2973209,Are there products in the category of $\sigma$-algebras and (reversed) $\sigma$-homomorphisms?,"Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $\sigma$ -algebra on a set $X$ , and $\mathcal{B}$ be a $\sigma$ -algebra on a set $Y$ . A map $h\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}$ is called a $\sigma$ -homomorphism if $h(\emptyset)=\emptyset$ , $h(Y\setminus B)=X\setminus h(B)$ for any $B\in\mathcal{B}$ , and $h\big(\bigcup B_n\big)=\bigcup h(B_n)$ for any sequence $\{B_n\}_{n\in\omega}$ in $\mathcal{B}$ . Let us consider a category where objects are pairs of the form $(X,\mathcal{A})$ , $\mathcal{A}$ being a $\sigma$ -algebra on $X$ , and morphisms $(X,\mathcal{A})\to(Y,\mathcal{B})$ are $\sigma$ -homomorphisms $h\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}$ . Note that the arrows are reversed. Question: Are there products in this category? Note: Original version of this question confusingly uses the term ""measurable space"" for the objects of the category in concern. The question is now rewrtitten to make clear the difference. There is a standard notion of ""the category of measurable spaces"" where objects are the same pairs as above and morphisms $(X,\mathcal{A})\to(Y,\mathcal{B})$ are measurable maps $f\colon X\to Y$ . Measurability means that $f^{-1}[B]\in\mathcal{A}$ for any set $B\in\mathcal{B}$ ; it is easy to check that then $f^{-1}\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}$ is $\sigma$ -homomorphism. However, not all $\sigma$ -homomorphisms are of this form; see here . So our category has the same objects but more morphisms than the standard category of measurable spaces. A natural candidate for a product of $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B})$ in our category of $\sigma$ -algebras is $(X\times Y,\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B})$ , where $\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}\,$ is the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by rectangles of the form $A\times B\,$ for $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$ , together with $\sigma$ -homomorphisms $f_1\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}$ and $f_2\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}$ defined by $f_1(A)=A\times Y$ and $f_2(B)=X\times B$ . Taking another $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{C}$ and $\sigma$ -homomorphisms $g_1\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{C}$ , $g_2\colon\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{C}$ , we have to prove that there exists a unique $\sigma$ -homomorphism $h\colon\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{C}$ such that $g_1=h\circ f_1$ and $g_2=h\circ f_2$ . We could define $h(A\times B)=g_1(A)\cap g_2(B)$ and then try to extend the definition of $h$ to the whole $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}$ . Is this approach working? How one can prove the existence and the uniqueness of $h$ ?","['boolean-algebra', 'measure-theory', 'category-theory']"
2973293,Perimeter of an equilateral triangle drawn with respect to a square.,"Here's a question that was asked in the International Kangaroo Math Contest 2016 . The question goes like this: If the perimeter of the square in the figure is 4 units, then what is the perimeter of the equilateral triangle? What I did: Well I tried something very naïve and it was the supposition that the equilateral triangle cuts the top side of the square at its midpoint. Hence giving the following result. By Pythagoras' Theorem, $$\overline{AB} = \overline{MC} = \sqrt{\overline{BC}^2 + \overline{BM}^2} = \sqrt{\left(1\right)^2 + \left(\frac12\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt5}{2}$$ So perimeter of the triangle is: $$\begin{align}
P&=\overline{AF} +\overline{FM}+\overline{MC}+\overline{CD}+\overline{DE}+\overline{EA}\\
&= \frac12+\frac12+\frac{\sqrt5}2+1+\frac12+\frac{\sqrt5}2\\
&= \frac52+\sqrt5
\end{align}$$ However this is not the correct answer and I know that the problem is with the supposition that $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ . So what is the correct method and answer? Thanks for the attention.","['analytic-geometry', 'geometry']"
2973319,Random Game Using Real Numbers,"The original question: Alice and Bob play a game. To win the game, Alice needs $a$ points, and Bob needs $1$ point ( $a$ is fixed for each game). In each round of the game, Alice picks a real number $x$ . Then a coin is flipped, and Alice is awarded $x$ points if the coin comes up heads, and Bob is awarded $x$ points if the coin comes up tails. Assume Alice always plays optimally. Your task is to find the probability that Alice wins given she is using the best strategy. This problem is a little difficult to formalize, so I will offer the following formalization. First, note that at the beginning of any round, we can normalize the game so that Bob needs exactly $1$ more point. We will define a strategy $s:\mathbb{R^+}\to\mathbb{R^+}$ as a function that takes as an input the number of points Alice needs, and outputs her choice $x$ . Define $p_s(a)$ to be the probability that Alice wins the game needing $a$ points and playing strategy $s$ . Let $S$ be the set of all strategies. Find $$p, p(a)=\sup_{s \in S}p_s(a).$$ First, we note that $p(a) = 1$ if $a = 1 - \epsilon < 1$ , as Alice can choose a sufficiently small $x$ and play it repeatedly until she wins. I have included a formal proof below. Second, we note that $p(1)$ still equals $1$ . Pick $\epsilon, 2\epsilon, 4\epsilon, 8\epsilon, \dots$ until she has won one of these. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$ , this will always happen before she is defeated by Bob. At this point, she is ahead of Bob by $\epsilon$ , and the argument for $a < 1$ applies. Again, I have included a formal proof below Clearly this also imples that $\lim_{a \to 1^+}p(a)=1$ . These are the easy cases. Now intuition suggests that $\lim_{a \to \infty}p(a)=\frac 12$ (she is forced to choose $x=a$ when $a$ is sufficiently large). I have not tried to prove this, but it does not seem too difficult. Finally, I can show that $p(2) \geq \frac 34$ . This is easily done by first having Alice choose $x=1-\epsilon$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ . If she wins the points, invoke the $\lim_{a \to 1^+}$ case to win with probability $1$ , and if not then choose $x=2$ to win with probability $\frac 12$ . This strategy can be expanded to any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by simply picking $1-\epsilon$ repeatedly, $n-1$ times. This shows that $p(n) \geq \frac 12 + 2^{-n+1}$ for natural numbers $n$ . Question: Can this bound be improved, shown to be tight, or extended to all real numbers? Proof for a < 1: Consider the game in which Bob needs $1$ point and Alice needs $1-\epsilon, \epsilon > 0$ points. We will show that for every $\delta > 0$ , there exists a strategy that allows Alice to win with probability at least $1-\delta$ . The strategy is simple: Alice will repeatedly choose $x=k$ , where $k=\frac{\epsilon^2}{8(2-\epsilon)\log \delta}$ . We note that once $2-\epsilon$ points have been awarded, one of the two players must have won. As a result, one of the two players will always have won after $\frac{2-\epsilon}{k}$ rounds have been played. Let $X_i, 1 \leq i \leq \frac{2-\epsilon}{k}$ be the indicator random variable that is $1$ if Bob wins round $i$ and $0$ otherwise, and let $X=\sum X_i$ . Then clearly Bob is awarded a total of $Xk$ points, and so he wins only if $X \geq \frac 1k.$ Then, $$\begin{aligned}
\Pr [\text{Bob wins}] =& \text{Pr }\left[X \geq \frac 1k\right] \\
=& \Pr \left[X \geq \frac 1k - \frac \epsilon {2k} + \frac \epsilon {2k}\right] \\
=& \Pr \left[X \geq \mathbb{E} [X] + \frac{\epsilon}{2k}\right] \\
=& \Pr \left[X \geq \mathbb{E} [X] \left(1+ \frac{\epsilon}{2-\epsilon}\right)\right] \\
\leq & \text{exp }\left(-\frac{2-\epsilon}{8k}\left(\frac{\epsilon}{2-\epsilon}\right)^2\right) \hspace{20 px} (*)\\
= & \delta
\end{aligned}$$ where $(*)$ is due to Chernoff Bounds. Proof for a=1: We will describe a set of strategies that allow Alice to win the game in which both she and Bob need $1$ point with probability $\geq 1-\delta$ for any $\delta > 0$ . Let $\delta ' = \frac \delta 2$ , and $r=\frac{\delta '}2$ . Alice will begin by choosing $x=r, 2r, 4r, 8r, \dots$ until either Bob wins the game, or until Alice wins any of these coin flips. It is easy to verify algebraically that the probability that Bob wins in this stage is $\leq \delta '$ . Once Alice wins any coin flip, she is ahead of Bob by exactly $r$ points. At this point, she can abandon her current betting scheme, normalize Bob's points and play a strategy for $a<1$ that gives her a win chance of $1-\delta '$ . By union bound, the probability of Bob winning is then $\leq 2\delta ' = \delta$ , as desired.","['game-theory', 'statistics', 'probability']"

Transitive: each column has each $x\in X$ once. Faithful: each row is different by at least one element. Free: each row is entirely different to others. (As a consequence every permutation is a derangement since it has no fixed points) Regular: All the listed above, so the table forms a symmetric matrix. I can give you a group with regular action, so the table follows the aforementioned criteria: $$G=\{e_4, (1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(2,4),(1,4)(2,3)\}$$ $$\begin{array}{|l|llll|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
\sigma_1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 
\sigma_2 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 \\
\sigma_3 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\
\sigma_4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$ As you can see it satisfied the criteria above. Q: What if $X=G$ ? Would be that an automorphism ( $G \times G \to G$ )? If it's the case, then do bijections from $G$ to $G$ give the corresponding permutation? Q:All the groups above were subgroups of the symmetric group on n symbols. If that wasn't the case, how would an example look like? Q: Can we determine the action type by observing if the properties are satisfied in the table? Q: Is there any alternative method to identify the group action of a G-set?","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"
2973709,Boundary Trace in Half Space,"Let $\Omega$ denote the upper half-plane in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , i.e. $$

I saw this question in a set of notes and, honestly, I'm not even sure how to understand the question itself. Functions in $H^1(\Omega)$ are actually equivalence classes of functions equal almost everywhere. So how does one even go about discussing pointwise convergence of the trace?

Must there exist then a maximal chain that is disjoint from $\mathcal{A}$ ? I am very stuck on this, however I suspect that it is true.

We want to show that $\mathcal{A}$ is then $X^{(r)}$ for some $r$ . I've thought about considering the set $C$ of chains that are disjoint from $\mathcal{A}$ , and considering the subset $C' \subset C$ containing all chains of length maximal in $C$ . Then we can look at $\mathcal{B} = \{c \in X^{(|C'|)} \mid \exists A \in C' \text{ such that } c \in A\}$ . This is the subset of $X^{(|C'|)}$ that contains all the last elements of the chains in $C'$ . My thinking was to either show that $|C'| = n$ or that you can extend some chain in $C'$ , contradicting maximality. However, I can't think of a good way to do either of these things. For contradiction, suppose we have $\mathcal{A}$ an antichain not of the form $X^{(r)}$ . Then I wanted to show that there exists a maximal chain that is disjoint from $\mathcal{A}$ .

We will call a group homomorphism $\chi: G_K \to \mathbb{C}^*$ with finite image a character on $K$ . Since every finite subgroup of $\mathbb{C}^*$ is cyclic, it is generated by a primitive root of unity. So in our case, every character $\chi$ corresponds to a unique cyclic Galois extension $F/K$ of degree $n$ , the cardinality of the image of $\chi$ , and an isomorphism $$\bar{\chi}: \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \xrightarrow{\sim} \langle \xi_n \rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}^*$$ where $\xi_n$ is a primitive $n$ -th root of unity. Let $\chi$ be a character which is induced by a cyclic Galois extension $F/K$ with prime power degree. Furthermore, let $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ be a Frobenius element in $G_K$ , i.e. an element whose image is $x \mapsto x^{|\kappa(K)|}$ under the restriction homomorphism $G_K \to G_{\kappa(K)}$ where $\kappa(K)$ is the residue field of $K$ . By $F^{nr}$ , we denote the maximal unramified subextension of $F/K$ . I want to show that the following statements are equivalent: $F/K$ is totally ramified, $F^{nr} = K$ , the image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ in $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is the identity element, $\chi(\operatorname{Frob}_K)=1$ . I think I was able to show the equivalences 1. $\Leftrightarrow$ 2. and 3. $\Leftrightarrow$ 4., so I am interested in the characterization from 1./2. to 3./4 and vice versa. Ideas : $\bar{\chi}$ is injective on $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ . The image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ under $G_K \to \operatorname{Gal}(F/K) \simeq G_K/\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K}/F)$ is the Frobenius element in $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ (Usually, a Frobenius element is unique up to conjugacy. But since $F/K$ is cyclic, it is unique indeed.). It should be the generator of $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ . The inertia subgroup $I_{F/K}$ of $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)$ is the unique cyclic subgroup of order $e$ , the ramification index of $F/K$ . We can identify $\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)/I_{F/K}$ with $\operatorname{Gal}(F^{nr}/K)$ . A generator of this group is the image of $\operatorname{Frob}_K$ , I think.

2974062,Why exactly limit in polar coordinates isn't sufficient to find the limit in two variables?,"I'm currently facing the following problem, my math teacher told us that the following statement is true: $\lim_{x\to(a,b)} f(x)=L \iff \forall \theta \lim_{r\to0} f(a+r\cos\theta, b+r\sin\theta)=L$ And in an attempt to better understand why this is true, I researched here for related questions and attempted to prove this myself. But I failed in finding any proof and my research led me to believe that the statement is actually false. Here is a link to one of the questions: Limit $\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$ is found using polar coordinates but it is not supposed to exist. In this question, he shows what I think is a counterexample to the statement above: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$$ in which using polar coordinates to find the limit returns $0$ regardless of the value of $\theta$ . But by making $y=x^2$ the limit is equal to $1/2$ . Therefore, the limit doesn't exists. The intuitive explanation for this, given in the accepted answer is that using polar coordinates only checks the limit in the directions of straight lines. But that explanation doesn't satisfy me at all, I still can't explain why checking the limit in every straight direction isn't sufficient. I feel that if I could come up with counterexample on my own that would mean I truly understand. So here are my first questions: Could you build your own counterexamples? And how would/did you go about doing this? Are there any counterexamples you know? Am I really correct in assuming that the statement is actually false? Since the polar limit checks in every straight direction, the following statement is true? $\forall y\in\mathbb{R}^2\lim_{t\to0} f((a,b)+ty)=L \iff \forall \theta \lim_{r\to0} f(a+r\cos\theta, b+r\sin\theta)=L$ Don't know if that is particularly useful.","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates', 'real-analysis']"

2974370,Questions on Proof of Intermediate Value Theorem,"I am trying to follow a proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem in Ross's real-analysis textbook, but do not understand several of the steps. I'm going to replicate the proof as much as I can (sometimes adding additional detail, so if I state something incorrectly without knowing, please tell me) and pause at these questions. Theorem. If $f$ is a continuous real-valued function on an interval $I$ , then $f$ has the intermediate value property on $I$ : Whenever $a, b \in I$ , $a < b$ , and $y$ lies between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ [i.e., $f(a) < y < f(b)$ or $f(b) < y < f(a)$ ], there exists at least one $x$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(x) = y$ . -- Proof. Suppose that $f(a) < y < f(b)$ . We define a set $S = \{x \in [a,b]: f(x) < y\}$ . Since $f(a) < y$ by assumption, $a \in S$ , so $S$ is nonempty. Furthermore, $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \leq x \leq b\}$ by definition, so it follows, it follows that $x \leq b, \forall x \in S$ , so $S$ is bounded above by $b$ . By the completeness axiom, $S$ has a supremum, $x_0$ . For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $x_0 - \frac{1}{n} < x_0$ , so $x_0 - \frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound for the set of $S$ , by the definition of the supremum. The only thing I am confused on here is whether we are able to assert that $x < b$ . We know $f(b) > y$ , so $b$ is not in $S$ , which suggests that we can make this greater assertion. Because $x_0 - \frac{1}{n}$ is not an upper bound of $S$ , there exists some element in $S$ greater than it. So, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , there exists some $s_n \in S$ such that $x_0 - \frac{1}{n} < s_n \leq x_0$ . Here, I am not completely sure on the strategy. He seems to take $s_n$ as not a particular element of $S$ , but to treat $S$ as a sequence (we take the limit in the next step) and then take $s_n$ to be a subsequence where we create a value for each natural number. Is this the correct way to think about it? Therefore, $\lim s_n = x_0$ . Does this follow from the squeeze lemma? Limits preserve $\leq$ inequalities, so $x_0 - \frac{1}{n} < s_n \leq x_0$ implies $\lim \left(x_0 - \frac{1}{n} \right) \leq \lim s_n \leq \lim \left(x_0 \right)$ and that $x_0 \leq \lim s_n \leq x_0$ , so by the squeeze lemma $\lim s_n = x_n$ . That $f(s_n) < y$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , and since $f$ is continuous, it follows that $f(x_0) = \lim f(s_n) \leq y$ . Assuming that I am correct in thinking that each $s_n$ is an element of the set that we are treating as a subsequence of $S$ (meaning that when we talk about the limit of $s_n$ , we are are talking about the sequence, but when we say $f(s_n) < y$ , we are talking an individual element), then I believe i understand this. Define $t_n = \min\left(b, x_0 + \frac{1}{n}\right)$ . I am assuming, again, that this is a subsequence of $S$ . Observe that $x_0 \leq t_n \leq x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ . I do not understand completely the second of these inequalities. If $t_n = b$ , since $b$ is an upper bound of $S$ and $x_0$ is its supremum, it follows that $x_0 \leq t_n$ , so I understand this. But $n$ is strictly positive, obviously, so $x_0 + \frac{1}{n} > x_0$ . If $x_0 = t_n$ , then $x_0 + \frac{1}{n} > t_n$ . I suppose we have $t_n = x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ is $x_0 + \frac{1}{n} < b$ and thus $t_n = x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ . Is this correct? Therefore, $\lim t_n = x_0$ . I assume this is also a result of the squeeze lemma, correct? Observe that each $t_n$ belongs to $[a,b]$ but not to $S$ . If $t_n = b$ , then it surely doesn't belong to $S$ since $f(b) > y$ . Is the additional argument then that since $x_0$ is the supremum of $S$ , then if $x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ were in $S$ , then $x_0$ couldn't be its supremum (a contradiction), then $x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ cannot be in the set? I think I understand why $t_n$ is not in $S$ , but not why they are still in $[a,b]$ . Surely $b$ is in $[a,b]$ , and I suppose in the case where $x_0 + \frac{1}{n}$ is greater than $b$ , then $t_n = b$ , so we stay in $[a,b]$ . Is that correct? Therefore, $f(t_n) \geq y$ for all $n$ . Therefore, since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_0) = \lim f(t_n) \geq y$ . Since $f(x_0) \leq y$ and $f(x_0) \geq y$ , it follows that $f(x_0) = y$ . Therefore, $\exists x \in (a,b)$ such that $f(x) = y$ . I understand everything here. I would greatly appreciate any insights on the above points or on something I missed. Thanks in advance.","['proof-explanation', 'real-analysis']"
2974375,Related Rates Calculus Trigonometric Problem,"I've been stuck on this related rates problem for a while now and I just can't figure out how to even approach it. The problem goes something like this: The above diagram shows two objects moving at different speeds. Both objects are 0.5 miles from the origin. The blue object is moving at 50mph. The straight-line distance between the blue object and the red object is increasing at a rate of 35 mph. Find the speed of the red object. I tried to solve it using Pythagorean Theorem and finding the derivative of the top side of the triangle. Anyway, I ended up getting a negative number, and even ignoring the sign, the answer I got was obviously wrong. I know the speed of the red object is obviously greater than the blue object because the distance between the objects is increasing. I just really don't know how to calculate the magnitude of said number. There's also a variation of this problem where the straight-line distance is changing at a rate of -35mph but I think that should be doable once I understand how to go about solving the original.

2974378,Equicontinuity of the Image of a set of Functions under an Integral Operator.,"Let $X = C([0,1])$ be the Banach space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ (with the supremum norm) and define a map $F:X\rightarrow X$ by $$F(f)(x)=\int^{x}_{0} \cos(f(t)^{2})dt, \space x \in [0; 1].$$ Show that $FX=\{F(f):f \in X \} \subset X$ is relatively compact. This comes down to using the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. I have shown pointwise boundedness. I am stuck on showing equicontinuity. So far I have tried the following $$\begin{align} |(F(f)-F(g))(x)| &= \Big{|} \int^{x}_{0} \cos(f(t)^{2}-\cos(g(t)^{2}) dt \Big{|} \\ &\leq \int^{x}_{0}| \cos(f(t)^{2})-\cos(g(t)^{2})| dt\\ &= \int^{x}_{0} \Big|f(t)^{2}-g(t)^{2}| dt \end{align}.$$ I am stuck at this point, as I do not know how to bound the term inside the integral.

2974476,Conserved Current for a PDE,"Let $(x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ , $W(x)$ be a (smooth enough) real-valued function and consider the following partial differential equation for the real-valued function $U(x,t)$ \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{4 m^2} \frac{\partial^4 U}{\partial x^4}+ \frac{W}{m} \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} +\frac{W’}{m} \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} + \left( \frac{W’’}{2m} - \frac{W^2}{\hbar^2} \right) U \qquad (I),

In the following we shall be quite sloppy, and we shall assume that given (smooth enough) initial conditions $U(x,0)$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}(x,0)$ (lying in some space) there exists a unique (smooth enough) solution $U$ (lying in some space) to (I). Let us call the set of solutions $\mathcal{E}$ . Let $D_{x}^k F$ be the set of all partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$ from order 1 to order $k$ .

\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial J}{\partial x}=0;
\end{equation} (iii) $p$ is not the constant function. The answer I think should be negative, but I don't how to ""prove"" this: since we have not formulated the problem in a rigorous way, we do not expect to get a rigorous proof, but some heuristic, but convincing argument in this direction. NOTE (1) This problem, as the notation shows, has a physical background, and the mathematical formulation of the problem that I give here is my personal interpretation of a physical exposition given by the great XXth century physicist David Bohm in his wonderful treatise $\mathit{Quantum}$ $\mathit{Theory}$ published in 1951. For all the physical details about this problem see my post Nonexistence of a Probability for Real Wave Functions . NOTE (2) Bohm's physical discussion is not very clear, so that it can admit different mathematical interpretations. A simpler interpretation of Bohm's original statement is the following. Consider the following equation \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{4m^2} \frac{\partial^4 U}{\partial x^4} \qquad{(II)},
\end{equation} and let $\mathcal{F}$ the set of all (smooth enough) solutions of this equation.
Do there exists (smooth enough) real-valued functions $p \geq 0$ and $j$ such that, by setting \begin{equation}

\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial J}{\partial x}=0;
\end{equation} (ii) for the special solution $U(x,t)=\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{2m \omega}{\hbar}}x-\omega t \right)$ , we have that $P(x,t)$ is independent of $\omega > 0$ ; (iii) $p$ is not a constant function?

2974566,Bias adjustment for the Box-Cox back-transformation,"I'm learning time series analysis and I don't understand why the back-transform of Box-Cox transformation outputs the median instead of the mean of the forecast distribution.

      \log(y_t) & \text{if $\lambda=0$};  \\
      (y_t^\lambda-1)/\lambda & \text{otherwise}.

      \exp(w_{t}) & \text{if $\lambda=0$};\\
      (\lambda w_t+1)^{1/\lambda} & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$ In the book that I'm reading ""Forecasting: Principles and Practice"". It says that: One issue with using mathematical transformations such as Box-Cox transformations is that the back-transformed point forecast will not be the mean of the forecast distribution. In fact, it will usually be the median of the forecast distribution (assuming that the distribution on the transformed space is symmetric). For many purposes, this is acceptable, but occasionally the mean forecast is required. For example, you may wish to add up sales forecasts from various regions to form a forecast for the whole country. But medians do not add up, whereas means do. For a Box-Cox transformation, the back-transformed mean is given by: $$\begin{equation}
\tag{3}
y_t =
  \begin{cases}
     \exp(w_t)\left[1 + \frac{\sigma_h^2}{2}\right] & \text{if $\lambda=0$;}\\

Could you please help me explain why the point forecast in equation (2) is the median and the bias-adjusted forecast in equation (3) is the mean of the forecast distribution and what is the formula for $\sigma_h^2$ in equation (3)?

Theorem: Let $T\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ , then $W(T)$ is a convex subset of $\mathbb{C}$ , where $$W(T):=\{\langle T x\mid x\rangle;\;x \in \mathcal{H}\;\;\text{with}\;\|x\|=1\}.$$ Proof: Given $\lambda,\mu\in W(T)$ such that $\lambda\neq\mu$ and we will prove that $\eta=t\lambda+(1-t)\mu \in W(T)$ whenever $t\in [0,1]$ . Clearly we have $$\eta\in W(T)\Leftrightarrow t\in W(\alpha I+\beta T),$$ with $\alpha=-\frac{\mu}{\lambda-\mu}$ and $\beta=\frac{1}{\lambda-\mu}$ . Let $S=\alpha I+\beta T$ . We observe that $\eta\in W(T)$ if and only if $t\in W(S)$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ . Since $\lambda,\mu\in W(T)$ , then there exist unit vectors $x,y\in \mathcal{H}$ such that $$\lambda=\langle Tx\mid x\rangle\;\text{and}\;\mu=\langle Ty\mid y\rangle.$$ A simple calculation shows that $$\langle Sx\mid x\rangle=1\;\text{and}\;\langle Sy\mid y\rangle=0.$$ Define $g:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C}$ by $$g(\theta)=\langle Sy\mid x\rangle e^{-i\theta}+\langle Sx\mid y\rangle e^{i\theta},\;\theta\in \mathbb{R}.$$ Obviously $g(\theta+\pi) = -g(\theta)$ for all $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$ . Further, $\Im m g(0)=-\Im m g(\pi)$ . Since $g$ is a continuous function, then there exists $\theta_0\in [0,\pi]$ such that $\Im m g(\theta_0)=0$ . Now observe that the vectors $y$ and $\hat{x}=e^{i\theta_0}x$ are linearly independent. Otherwise, we write $y=\alpha \hat{x}$ for some $\alpha\in \mathbb{C}$ , then $|\alpha|=1$ and $0=\langle Sy\mid y\rangle=|\alpha|^2\langle S\hat{x}\mid \hat{x}\rangle=\langle Sx\mid x\rangle=1$ which is a contradiction. Hence, $\|(1-t)y+t\hat{x}\|\neq 0$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ . Put $$z_t=\frac{(1-t)y+t\hat{x}}{\|(1-t)y+t\hat{x}\|},\;t\in [0,1].$$ Clearly $\|z_t\|=1$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ . Moreover, one can see that $\langle Sz_0\mid z_0\rangle=0$ and $\langle Sz_1\mid z_1\rangle=1$ . This implies that $0,1\in W(S)$ . To finish the proof, define a continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]$ by $$f(t)=\langle Sz_t\mid z_t\rangle,\;t\in [0,1].$$ A straightforward calculation shows that $f$ is a real-valued function with $f(0)=0$ and $f(1) = 1$ . Hence $[0,1]\subset W(S)$ . In this proof I don't understant the following facts: $\eta\in W(T)\Leftrightarrow t\in W(\alpha I+\beta T).$ Why we use $\Im m g$ in order to find $\theta_0$ .

2974891,what is an ∞-group?,"I was reading on nLab and I found the term infinity group . The definition is awfully abstract: An ∞-group is a group object in ∞Grpd . Equivalently (by the delooping hypothesis) it is a pointed connected ∞-groupoid. Under the identification of ∞Grpd with Top this is known as an A∞-space, for instance. Then I tried to look up the term "" group-object "" and obtained: A group object in an (∞,1)-category generalizes and unifies two familiar concepts: it is the generalization of the notion of groupal Stasheff A∞-space from Top to more general (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes: an object that comes equipped with an associative and invertible monoid structure, up to coherent homotopy, and possibly only partially defined (see also looping and delooping for more on this) ; it generalizes the notion of equivalence relation – or rather the internal notion of congruence – from category theory to (∞,1)-category theory. At this point I don't even know enough to specify what an answer should look like. As I recall, a group $G$ is a set with a binary operation $\times$ so that $(G,\times)$ should have three properties: an identity element $e \in G$ with $e \times g = g \times e = g$ every element $g \in G$ has an inverse $g^{-1}$ so that $g \times g^{-1}= g^{-1} \times g = e$ multiplication is associative $a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c$ for all $a,b,c \in G$ .

I understand how they feel: the RRT feels counter-intuitive, and so the result should be denied as a contradiction and the partial-sum definition rejected. However, the definition of a series as $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\right)$$ feels like the most natural approach to take.

Is there an alternative (but not equivalent) definition of an infinite sum that agrees with the partial-sum definition on absolutely convergent sequences, but where the RRT doesn't hold?

2975109,How to convert Euler angles to Quaternions and get the same Euler angles back from Quaternions?,"I am rotating n 3D shape using Euler angles in the order of XYZ meaning that the object is first rotated along the X axis, then Y and then Z . I want to convert the Euler angle to Quaternion and then get the same Euler angles back from the Quaternion using some [preferably] Python code or just some pseudocode or algorithm. Below, I have some code that converts Euler angle to Quaternion and then converts the Quaternion to get Euler angles. However, this does not give me the same Euler angles. I think the problem is I don't know how to associate yaw, pitch and roll to X, Y an Z axes. Also, I don't know how to change order of conversions in the code to correctly convert the Euler angles to Quaternion and then convert the Quaternion to Euler angle so that I am able to get the same Euler angle back. Can someone help me with this? And here's the code I used: This function converts Euler angles to Quaternions: def euler_to_quaternion(yaw, pitch, roll):

        qx = np.sin(roll/2) * np.cos(pitch/2) * np.cos(yaw/2) - np.cos(roll/2) * np.sin(pitch/2) * np.sin(yaw/2)
        qy = np.cos(roll/2) * np.sin(pitch/2) * np.cos(yaw/2) + np.sin(roll/2) * np.cos(pitch/2) * np.sin(yaw/2)
        qz = np.cos(roll/2) * np.cos(pitch/2) * np.sin(yaw/2) - np.sin(roll/2) * np.sin(pitch/2) * np.cos(yaw/2)
        qw = np.cos(roll/2) * np.cos(pitch/2) * np.cos(yaw/2) + np.sin(roll/2) * np.sin(pitch/2) * np.sin(yaw/2)

        return [qx, qy, qz, qw] And this converts Quaternions to Euler angles: def quaternion_to_euler(x, y, z, w):

        import math
        t0 = +2.0 * (w * x + y * z)
        t1 = +1.0 - 2.0 * (x * x + y * y)
        X = math.degrees(math.atan2(t0, t1))

        t2 = +2.0 * (w * y - z * x)
        t2 = +1.0 if t2 > +1.0 else t2
        t2 = -1.0 if t2 < -1.0 else t2
        Y = math.degrees(math.asin(t2))

        t3 = +2.0 * (w * z + x * y)
        t4 = +1.0 - 2.0 * (y * y + z * z)
        Z = math.degrees(math.atan2(t3, t4))

        return X, Y, Z And I use them as follow: import numpy as np

newEulerRot = quaternion_to_euler(quat[0], quat[1], quat[2], quat[3]) #Convert the Quaternion to Euler angles

print (euler_Original)
print (newEulerRot) The print statements print different numbers for euler_Original and newEulerRot which I don't want to be the case. For example if euler_original contains numbers like (0.2, 1.12, 2.31) in radians I get this Quaternion --> [0.749, 0.290, -0.449, 0.389] and converting the Quaternion to Euler angles gives me this --> (132.35, 64.17, 11.45) which is pretty wrong. I wonder how I can fix this? Although I'm interested in getting the above code to work by making changes to it but, I would rather learn how to set up the equations correctly. This way I would know how I can get the correct Quaternions even if the order of rotations (XYZ --> YZX etc) for applying Euler angles is changed.","['python', 'coordinate-systems', 'geometry', 'quaternions', 'rotations']"

(ii) Is $(C[a,b], \| \cdot \|_2)$ a Banach space ? Attempt : (i) Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence defined over $C[a,b]$ that converges to $f$ with respect to the norm $\| \cdot \|_\infty$ . Then, this means that $\exists n_0 \in \mathbb N$ : $$\|f_n-f\|_\infty< e \Leftrightarrow \max_{x \in [a,b]}|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon \; \forall n \geq n_0$$ Now, let's consider the quantity $\| f_n - f \|_2$ . This is defined as : $$\|f_n - f\|_2 = \sqrt{\int_a^b (f_n-f)^2(x)\mathrm{d}x}=\sqrt{\int_a^b[f_n(x)-f(x)]^2\mathrm{d}x}$$ Now, the last expression can be rewritten as : $$\sqrt{\int_a^b[f_n(x)-f(x)]^2\mathrm{d}x}=\sqrt{\int_a^b |f_n(x) - f(x)|^2\mathrm{d}x}$$ But, it is : $$|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\max_{x \in [a,b]}|f_n(x)-f(x)| < \epsilon \; \forall n \geq n_0$$ Now, since $|f_n(x)-f(x)| \geq 0$ and $\epsilon >0$ , we yield : $$|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon \Rightarrow |f_n(x)-f(x)|^2 < \epsilon^2 \equiv \epsilon' \; \forall n\geq n_0$$ And by integrating from $a$ to $b$ since $f_n, f$ are defined over $C[a,b]$ : $$\int_a^b|f_n(x)-f(x)|^2\mathrm{d}x < \int_a^b\epsilon'\mathrm{d}x=\epsilon'(b-a) \equiv \epsilon'' \forall n\geq n_0$$ Thus, we have $\|f_n-f\|_2 < \epsilon'' \; \forall n\geq n_0$ , which means that $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ with respect to the $\|\cdot\|_2$ norm.

Then, the compact convergence and compact-open topologies on $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ coincide. For completeness sake: the compact-open topology is generated by the sub-basis $$
\{S(K,U) : K \subseteq X \text{ compact}, U \subseteq Y \text{open}\}
$$ with $S(K,U) = \{ f \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y) : f(K) \subseteq U\}$ , and the compact convergence topology is generated by the basis of open balls restricted to each compact set, $$
\{B_K(f,\varepsilon) : \varepsilon > 0 , K \subseteq X \text{ compact}\}
$$ with $B_K(f,\varepsilon) = \{f \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y) : d(f(x),g(x)) < \varepsilon \ (\forall x \in K)\}$ . What follows is my attempt. I would highly appreciate any comments on whether it is correct, and in that case, on how to make this argument more elegant. Let's denote $\tau_{co}$ and $\tau_{c}$ for the compact-open and compact convergence topologies respectively and see both inclusions. ( $\tau_{co} \subseteq \tau_c$ ): let $S(K,U) \in \tau_{co}$ . It suffices to see that $S(K,U)$ is open with respect to the compact convergence topology. Let $f \in S(K,U)$ . Now, by defnition this means that $f(K) \subseteq U$ and so $f(K) \cap U^c = \emptyset$ . Since $K$ is compact, $f(K)$ is compact and so it is closed in $Y$ (because it is metric). Hence we have that $\delta_f := d(f(K),U^c)$ is positive. This implies that $ B_K(f,\delta_f) \subseteq S(K,U)$ . In effect, by the contrapositive if $g \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is such that $g(K) \cap U^c$ is non empty, then taking $g(x) \in g(K) \cap U^c$ we get $$
d(f(x),g(x)) \geq d(f(K),U^c) = \delta_f.
$$ This proves that $B_K(f,\delta) \subseteq S(K,U)$ and so $$
S(K,U) = \bigcup_{f \in S(K,U)}B_K(f,\delta_f)
$$ is open for $\tau_c$ . ( $\tau_{c} \subseteq \tau_{co}$ ): with the same idea, let $B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ be an open set for $\tau_{co}$ and let's see that for each $g \in B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ , there exists $S(K',U') \in \tau_{co}$ with $g \in S(K',U') \subseteq B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ . Since $K$ is compact and the mapping $$
K \hookrightarrow X \xrightarrow{1 \times 1} X \times X \xrightarrow{(f,g)} Y \times Y \xrightarrow{d} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
$$ is continuous, it attains a maximum, $$
\delta_g :=  \max_{x \in K}d(f(x),g(x)) < \varepsilon.
$$ Now, let $\mu = \varepsilon - \delta_g$ , and note that the set $$
U := \{y \in Y  : d(y,g(k)) < \mu \ , \ (\forall k \in K)\}
$$ is open: if $y\in U$ then $m_y := \max_{k \in K}d(y,g(k)) < \mu$ . Thus, if $d(z,y) < \mu -m_y$ , $$
d(z,g(k)) \leq d(z,y) + d(y,g(k)) < \mu - m_y + m_y = \mu
$$ and therefore $B_{m_y}(y) \subseteq U$ . Finally if $h \in S(K,U)$ , then for each $x \in K$ we have that $$
d(h(x),f(x)) \leq d(h(x),g(x)) + d(g(x),f(x)) < \mu + \delta_g = \varepsilon,
$$ which proves that $S(K,U) \subseteq B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ . Thoughts?",['general-topology']

Class was split, and no one changed their opinion. Curious if it is obvious to outsiders, or if anyone can offer any proof. Course was split with most poker and blackjack players arguing these are dependent events, with most others claiming they were independent and you could simulate relevant events with an infinite deck. Take a standard deck with no jokers. 52 cards. Four aces, four deuces, four threes, and so on. Shuffle the deck. Draw cards until you spot a match, ie, a card with the same numerical value as the last card drawn. Does drawing such a match affect the odds of drawing a subsequent match later in the deck? Clarifying note: I call a match a ""pair"" in the title, but ""match"" is more precise. Drawing three in a row counts as two matches, but most people would not call that two pairs.","['conditional-probability', 'poker', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

2975802,$f = g$ almost everywhere implies $f =g$ for any continuous function $f$ and $g$.,"Let $f,g : [0,T] \to X$ be continuous $X$ -valued functions for Banach Space $(X,||\, \cdot\,||)$ . Suppose that $f = g$ almost everywhere in $C([0,T],X)$ , then $f = g$ in $C([0,T],X)$ . This is my attempt so far : First, $f = g$ almost everywhere in $C([0,T],X)$ means $\forall t \in [0,T]\backslash M, f(t) = g(t)$ for some $M$ measure zero set. Therefore, our claim is $M \neq \emptyset$ . By contradiction, suppose there exists $t_{1} \in M\subset [0,T]$ such that $f(t_{1}) \neq g(t_{1})$ . Then, we know that $||f(t_{1}) - g(t_{1})|| \neq 0$ . Furthermore, from our assumption, we know that $\forall t \in [0,T]\backslash M, ||f(t) - g(t)|| = 0$ . However, since $f$ and $g$ are in $C([0,T],X)$ , then $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ such that $\forall t \in (t_{1}-\delta, t_{1}+\delta), f(t)\neq g(t)$ . Therefore, $\forall t \in (t_{1}-\delta, t_{1}+\delta), ||f(t) - g(t)||\neq 0$ . Fix $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_{1}$ to obtain $\delta = \delta_{1}$ . Then, $(t_{1}-\delta_{1},t_{1}+\delta_{1}) \subset M$ which means measure of $M$ is not zero. This is a contradiction and therefore $M = \emptyset$ which implies $\forall t \in [0,T], f(t) = g(t)$ in $C([0,T],X)$ . So my question is where did I make any mistake? Also, I want to make this argument more rigorous so I would like to ensure $f(t) \neq g(t)$ in $(t_{1} - \delta_{1}, t_{1} + \delta_{1}$ ). Is my reasoning enough to ensure that? I tried to use $\varepsilon_{1} = \frac{1}{2}||f(t_{1}) - g(t_{1})||$ but I am unsure whether I am correct or not. Any help is very much appreciated!

The answer is $\large\frac{\binom{11}{7}}{\binom{19}{7}}$ which is about $0.0065$ . I reached this result independently, and it was confirmed by the official homework solution of the university.
