1322053,Prove $c_0$ is a banach space.,"The subspace of null sequences $c_0$ consists of all sequences whose limit is zero. 
Prove that $c_0$ is a closed subspace of $C$ (The space of convergent sequences), and so again a Banach space. There's something I don't understand. I know we have to prove that every Cauchy sequence on $c_0$ is convergent on $C$ in order to prove $c_0$ is closed on $C$.
But, that Cauchy sequence will be a sequence of sequences? Because the elements of $C$ and $c_0$ are sequences. I'm really confused.","['analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
1322057,An arbitrary product of connected spaces is connected,"Let $\lbrace X_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of connected spaces; let $X$ be the product space $$X=\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$$ Let a $=(a_\alpha)$ be a fixed point of $X$ . Given any finite subset $K$ of $J$ , let $X_K$ denote the subspace of $X$ consisting of all points x $=(x_\alpha)$ such that $x_\alpha=a_\alpha$ for $\alpha \notin K$ . Show that $X_K$ is connected. As the title suggests, this is part 1 of 3 to show that $X$ is connected (found in Munkres' Topology, second edition, p. 152). The other parts look fairly straightforward, but this one has been a little tricky for me; the main problem is that $J$ might be uncountable, which makes traditional index notation unusable. My approach so far has been to show that $X_K$ is homeomorphic to a finite sub-product of $X$ . If $|K|=n$ (which is known to be finite), then let $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ be the $n$ indices for which x and a differ. Also let $$Z=\prod_{m=\alpha_1}^{\alpha_n} X_m$$ I suspect that $X_K$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ . The most natural map would be $f: X_K \rightarrow Z$ defined by, for x $\in X_K$ , ""stripping off"" all coordinates of x which disagree with a , leaving only finitely many. The inverse would take z $\in Z$ and ""fill in"" the coordinates of a that are missing. I haven't tried showing that $f$ is invertible or continuous for uncountable $J$ , but I have tried for countable indices; invertibility doesn't seem to be a problem, but continuity is tripping me up: When $J$ is countable, without loss of generality, take $J=\mathbb{N}$ and $K=\lbrace 1,2,...,n \rbrace$ , so $$Z=\prod_{m=1}^n X_m $$ Now a = $(a_1,a_2,...)$ , and x $\in X_K$ has the form $(x_1,...,x_n,a_{n+1},...)$ . Thus $f(x_1,...,x_n,a_{n+1},...)=(x_1,...,x_n)$ . Suppose $U$ is open in $Z$ . Then $U=U_1 \times ... \times U_n$ , where $U_i$ is open in $X_i$ . $f^{-1}(U)=U_1 \times ... \times U_n \times \lbrace a_{n+1} \rbrace \times...$ . It seems difficult to conclude that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open, as the singleton sets appended on the end may or may not be open in their individual sets, depending on the properties of the $X_i$ . The approach also seems awkward when attempting to generalize to uncountable indices. Apologies for the long question statement, but one more request - please NO FULL SOLUTIONS . I am working through this for an assignment and would like to figure it out on my own, even though I am momentarily stumped.","['product-space', 'connectedness', 'general-topology']"

1322085,group of diffeomorphisms of interval is perfect,"Every element in $\mathrm{Diff}([0,1])$, group of diffeomorphisms of interval fixing the endpoints, can be written as a product of commutators since this group is perfect (I don't know the proof though). Is it possible to write every element as just one commutator? Edit: @Jim Belk I'm confused actually. The motivation for this question was this statement ,which I've seen in a paper in a peer reviewed journal(without proof though): If S is a surface with boundary which is not compact planar, and $b$ is a boundary component and $\mu$ is a diffeomorphism of the interval, then there is a foliation of $S \times [0,1]$ (we can think about it as a fiber bundle over S with fiber [0,1]), transverse to [0,1] factor, such that it has holonomy $\mu$ on boundary $b$. I've considered the case that S is a once punctured torus because it implies the general case. Now if we look at representation of fundamental group into group of diffeomorphisms of the fiber ([0,1] here) then this implies that $\mu$ can be written as a commutator in the diffeomorphism group and these two statements are equivalent. Am I missing something?","['group-theory', 'smooth-manifolds', 'foliations']"

1322092,Bijective function between lists and sets,"How many eight-bit strings have exactly three $1$’s? The answer is $8\choose 3$. Since we count subsets here, how can we set up a one-to-one correspondence between any $8$bit list with only three $1$s and some set? Consider the list $11100000$. Can we set up a correspondence like $11100000 \leftarrow \rightarrow \{123\}$ where the elements of the set are the numbers of the positions of ones? Since the $i$th position is fixed and named it doesn't matter if it comes before $i +1$th position in the set or after $i - 1$th position in the set, that is, $\{123\} = \{213\} = \{312\}$.

1322093,why does infinitesimal lifting imply triviality of infinitesimal deformations?,"I'm trying to learn some deformation theory, but I'm stuck on the proof of corollary 4.7 in https://math.berkeley.edu/~robin/math274root.pdf Let $X$ be an affine nonsingular scheme of finite type over some algebraically closed field $k$. Let $D = k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)$, and let $X'$ be an infinitesimal deformation of $X$ over $D$ (ie, the $X'$ is flat over $D$, and the reduced fiber is $X$). The infinitesimal lifting property for nonsingular affine schemes then implies that if $i : X\rightarrow X'$ is the inclusion, then there exists a map $g : X'\rightarrow X$ such that $g\circ i = \text{id}_X$. My question is: Why does this imply that $X'$ is the trivial deformation? (ie, that $X' = X\times_k D$)?","['algebraic-geometry', 'deformation-theory']"

Must $M$ contain exactly seven $0$ s? This question is a special case of my previous question: Exactly $n-1$ nonzero elements if $\det(A)=0$ for every arrangement Thanks to user Holonomia, we know a counterexample to the analogous question for $2\times 2$ matrices: Any $2\times 2$ matrix with two $1$ s and two $-1$ s has determinant $0$ . However, I have not been able to make much progress on the $3\times 3$ case.

1322112,Surface of constant mean curvature,"From PDE Evans, 2nd edition: Chapter 8, Exercise 12: Assume $u$ is a smooth minimizer of the area integral $$I[w]=\int_U (1+|Dw|^2)^{1/2} \, dx,$$ subject to given boundary conditions $w=g$ on $\partial U$ and the constraint $$J[w] = \int_U w \, dx = 1.$$ Prove that graph of $u$ is a surface of constant mean curvature. (Hint: Recall Example 4 in §8.1.2.) First, I will print Example 4 from the textbook (page 457) below: Example 4 (Minimal surfaces) . Let $$L(p,z,x)=(1+|p|^2)^{1/2},$$ so that $$I[w] = \int_U (1+|Dw|^2)^{1/2} \, dx$$ is the area of the graph of the function $w : U \to \mathbb{R}$ . The associated Euler-Lagrange equation is $$\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{u_{x_i}}{(1+|Du|^2)^{1/2}} \right)_{x_i}=0 \quad \text{in }U.$$ $\quad$ This partial differential equation is the minimal surface equation . The expression $\operatorname{div} \left(\frac{Du}{(1+|Du|^2)^{1/2}} \right)$ on the left side of $(10)$ is $n$ times the mean curvature of the graph of $u$ . Thus a minimal surface has zero mean curvature . I don't have much work started on this, but this question looks interesting. (This is not a homework assignment, as with all my other PDE Evans questions.) But I am asking here because I do not understand fundamentally how mean curvature is applied to Euler-Lagrange equations. In particular, this question uses concepts of differential geometry, which I have not taken any courses in yet in my academic career. Now, what I do know so far, is that maybe I should show that the graph of $u$ is a minimal surface. This would mean $u$ has zero mean curvature, and hence a constant mean curvature (zero is constant, obviously). How should I start about this problem?","['calculus-of-variations', 'differential-geometry', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'partial-differential-equations']"

1322159,"Computing the matrix that represents orthogonal projection,","There is a theorem that says if $U$ is an orthogonal matrix, i.e., its columns (or rows) form an orthonormal basis, then the action of $UU^T$ represents orthogonal projection of the vector space onto the space spanned by the columns of $U$. But, why does this theorem also apply when my ""$U$"" matrix is a $3\times1$ column vector and hence not an orthogonal matrix (it's not even square)? I had to compute the matrix that represents orthogonal projection onto the line spanned by $(1, 2, -1)$.  So, following the Gram-Schmidt process for this simple case, just set $v_1= (1,2,-1)$.  Then I normalized this vector to make it of unit length.  Finally, I compute $VV^T$ to get a $3\times3$ matrix.  I applied the theorem stated above and concluded that this $3\times3$ matrix represents orthogonal projection onto the line spanned by the one column in $V$, which has the same span as the span of $(1, 2,-1)$, since the Gram-Schmidt process produces a set of orthogonal vectors with the same span as the original set of linearly independent vectors. Have I applied the theorem incorrectly?  I got the correct matrix. Thanks,","['projective-geometry', 'orthogonality', 'linear-algebra', 'matrices']"
1322160,Sufficient condition for $0$ to be in a closed convex hull in a Hilbert space.,"I am working on the following problem: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space, let $\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^\infty \subset \mathcal{H}$ be a sequence such that $||a_n|| = 1$, and consider the closed convex hull of $\left\{ a_n \right\}$, $$\mathcal{C} = \overline{\left\{ \sum_{i}^{< \infty} c_i a_i \;\colon\; c_i \geq 0 \text{ and } \sum c_i = 1 \right\}}.$$ (a)  If $\mathcal{H} = \text{span}\left\{ a_n \right\}$, then $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional.
  (b)  $$\text{If } \lim_{n \to \infty} \left<a_n, x\right> = 0 \text{ for all } x \in \mathcal{H}, \text{ then } 0 \in \mathcal{C}.$$ I already proved (a).  I presume that (a) might have something to do with proving (b), but I am not sure.  Notice that if $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional, then the hypotheses of (b) are absurd, for they force $||a_n|| \to 0$.  I thought then maybe I could approach this by contradiction and show that if we assume $0 \notin \mathcal{C}$, then $\mathcal{H} = \text{span}\left\{a_n\right\}$ (or, at least, $\text{span}\left\{a_n\right\}$ is closed and thus a Hilbert space), and we would be done, but I haven't made any progress on this front.  Another thought I had was to just try to write down explicitly a sequence in $\mathcal{C}$ that converges to $0$.  The most obvious thing feels to me something like $$x_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i.$$  Then $$||x_n||^2 \leq \frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{i \neq j} |\left< a_i, a_j \right>|. $$  We would be done if we could show $|\left< a_i, a_j \right>| < \epsilon$ for all $i \neq j$ and $i$, $j$ sufficiently large, but my question here uniformly convergent subsequence of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space? seems to preclude this method, even after restricting to subsequences to avoid pathological situations.  So I'm stuck.  Any help would be appreciated. -Thanks. EDIT:  I just caught a mistake, I should have written $$||x_n||^2 \leq \frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{i < j} |\text{Re}\left< a_i, a_j \right>|. $$  This shouldn't fix anything though, because Martin's answer on the page linked above still gives a nice counterexample.","['hilbert-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

1322198,Probability of get a kidney donated,"It is really a probability problem. I use the story of kidney donation because it is easier to describe. Consider the following scenario: Time is discrete. At each period, the measure of patients in the hospital is $M$. At each period, the measure of new kidney supply $I$ is i.i.d. positive, with mean $\mu_I$ and variance $\sigma_I^2$. If the measure of kidneys $I$ is larger than measure of waiting patients $M$, then every patient will be matched. But unmatched kidneys cannot be used next time. If $I<M$, each will be matched by probability $I/M$. There is no first come first serve rule here. A patient leaves the game if and only if he/she gets donated. If one is not matched at the current period, he can go to next period. A patient never dies. The number of patients next period will be $$M'=M-I+m$$ - a measure $m>0$ of new patients will come. $m$ is certain. Now I assume $E(I)<m$ - the waiting pool has a positive probability of going to infinitely large.

The equality is easy. My problem is getting the factor of $\pi$ on the right-hand side of the inequality; I keep getting $2\pi$. Here's what I have so far. Let $\log z$ denote the branch of the logarithm with $0\leq \arg(z)<2\pi$. For $1\gg\epsilon,\delta>0$, consider the contour $\gamma$ given by \begin{align*}
&\gamma_{1}(t):=e^{2\pi it}, \qquad \epsilon\leq t\leq 1-\epsilon\\
&\gamma_{2}(t):=(1-t)e^{2\pi i(1-\epsilon)},\qquad 0\leq t\leq 1-\delta\\
&\gamma_{3}(t):=\delta e^{-2\pi i t},\qquad \epsilon\leq t\leq 1-\epsilon\\
&\gamma_{4}(t):=te^{2\pi i\epsilon},\qquad \delta\leq t\leq 1
\end{align*} Since $f(z):=\log(z)P(z)^{2}$ is holomorphic on and insider the contour, we see from Cauchy's theorem that $$0=\int_{\gamma}\log(z)P(z)^{2}dz=\left(\int_{\gamma_{1}}+\int_{\gamma_{2}}+\int_{\gamma_{3}}+\int_{\gamma_{4}}\right)f(z)dz$$ I get that
\begin{align*}
\int_{\gamma_{1}}f(z)dz&=\int_{\epsilon}^{1-\epsilon}(2\pi i t)P(e^{2\pi i t})^{2}(2\pi i)e^{2\pi i t}dt\\
&\rightarrow-4\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{1}P(e^{2\pi i t})^{2}e^{2\pi i t}dt, \ \epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}
\end{align*} \begin{align*}
\int_{\gamma_{3}}f(z)dz&=\int_{\epsilon}^{1-\epsilon}\left[\log\delta+2\pi i t\right]P(\delta e^{2\pi i t})^{2}(2\pi i)\delta e^{2\pi i t}dt\\
&\rightarrow 0, \ \delta\rightarrow 0^{+}
\end{align*}
by dominated convergence. Now observe that \begin{align*}
\int_{\gamma_{4}}f(z)dz&=\int_{\delta}^{1}\left[\log\left|t\right|+2\pi i\epsilon\right]P(te^{2\pi i\epsilon})^{2}e^{2\pi i\epsilon}dt\\
&\rightarrow\int_{\delta}^{1}\log\left|t\right|P(t)^{2}dt, \ \epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}\\
&\rightarrow\int_{0}^{1}\log\left|t\right|P(t)^{2}dt, \ \delta\rightarrow 0^{+}
\end{align*}
by dominated convergence. Similarly, \begin{align*}
\int_{\gamma_{2}}f(z)dz&=\int_{0}^{1-\delta}\left[\log\left|1-t\right|+2\pi i(1-\epsilon)\right]P((1-t)e^{2\pi i(1-\epsilon)})^{2}-e^{2\pi i(1-\epsilon)}dt\\
&\rightarrow-\int_{0}^{1-\delta}\left[\log\left|1-t\right|+2\pi i\right]P(1-t)^{2}dt, \ \epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}\\
&\rightarrow-\int_{0}^{1}\left[\log\left|1-t\right|+2\pi i\right]P(1-t)^{2}, \ \delta\rightarrow 0^{+}
\end{align*}
again by dominated convergence. Making the change of variable $s=1-t$, we obtain that
\begin{align*}
\lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0^{+}}\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}\int_{\gamma_{2}}f(z)dz&=\int_{1}^{0}\left[\log\left|s\right|+2\pi i\right]P(s)^{2}ds=-\int_{0}^{1}\left[\log\left|s\right|+2\pi i\right]P(s)^{2}ds
\end{align*} Combining these results, we see that
$$0=\lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0^{+}}\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}\int_{\gamma}f(z)dz=-4\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{1}P(e^{2\pi i t})^{2}e^{2\pi it}dt-2\pi i\int_{0}^{1}P(t)^{2}dt$$ Since $P$ is real on the real axis $P(t)^{2}=\left|P(t)\right|^{2}$, for $0\leq t\leq 1$, whence
\begin{align*}
2\pi\int_{0}^{1}P(t)^{2}dt\leq4\pi^{2}\int_{0}^{1}\left|P(e^{2\pi i t})^{2}\right|dt&=\int_{0}^{1}P(e^{2\pi i t})\overline{P(e^{2\pi i t})}dt\\

1322296,Representing rational numbers on a number line,"Though the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is the same as the cardinality of the set of rational numbers, when one looks at a number line this fact seems counterintuitive, since between every rational number there exist an infinite number of more rational numbers. Of course, it can be shown that $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable by simply ordering them on an infinite array (the ""zig-zag"" method). Thus there are the same ""number"" of rationals as there are natural numbers (they have the same size).

However, if we consider the rational numbers on a normal number line, there are an infinite number of rationals in between two arbitrary rational numbers, and hence the layman is mislead into thinking that rationals outnumber naturals. Why are these two ""lines"" so different? Why does the normal number line appear to be more ""densely"" populated with rationals than the ""reorganized"" number line?

Is what is meant by this that, say for example I have a set $X=\lbrace a,b,c,d\rbrace$, then I can define a topology on this set $\tau = \lbrace \emptyset ,\lbrace a\rbrace, \lbrace a,b\rbrace, \lbrace a,b,c\rbrace, \lbrace a,b,c,d\rbrace\rbrace$.

Is this what is also meant when people speak of two objects being topologically equivalent, as although they may look very different, the relationships between the points remain the same, i.e. $b$ is still ""nearer"" to $a$ than $c$ even though there may be a huge number of different points added to the neighbourhoods of each of them under some continuous deformation?","['differential-geometry', 'general-topology']"

1322604,Ways to prove Euler's formula for $\zeta(2n)$,"I recently, out of interest, tried to prove Euler's formula $\zeta{(2n)}=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}B_{2n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. I adapted  Euler's original proof for $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$: We have the well known formulas $\sin(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^kx^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}$ and $\sin(x)=x\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{k^2\pi^2}\right)$. The product formula can be transformed into a series expansion as well but in order to keep it neat, some definitions first: For the real sequence $\left(a_i\right)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ with $\sum a_i$ convergent, define
$$
A_n:=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i^n
$$
$$
\alpha_n:=\sum_{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in M_n}\prod_{r=1}^{n} a_{x_r}
$$
Where $M_n:=\{(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb N\space|\space x_1<\dots<x_n\}$. Now we write $c_i=-\frac{1}{i^2\pi^2}$. When we expand the product, we get only odd exponents of $x$ and the coefficient of $x^{2k+1}$ for $k≥1$ is $\gamma_k$. By comparison of the coefficients, we obtain $\gamma_k=\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}$. Now, through telescoping, it can be shown algebraically that for every sequence $\left(a_i\right)_{i\in\mathbb N}$ with $\sum a_i$ convergent we have: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)^{n-i}\alpha_{n+1-i}\space A_{i}}=A_{n+1}+(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)\alpha_{n+1}$$
For all $n\in\mathbb N_0$. Since $C_n=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{i^2\pi^2}\right)^n=\frac{(-1)^n}{\pi^{2n}}\zeta{(2n)}$ we have:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)^{n-i}\gamma_{n+1-i}\space C_{i}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)^{n-i}\frac{(-1)^{n+1-i}}{(2n-2i+3)!}\frac{(-1)^i}{\pi^{2i}}\zeta{(2i)}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)^{i-1}\frac{\zeta{(2i)}}{(2n-2i+3)!\pi^{2i}}}=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\pi^{2n+2}}\zeta{(2n+2)}+(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(2n+3)!}=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\pi^{2n+2}}\zeta{(2n+2)}+\frac{(n+1)}{(2n+3)!} \iff \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{(-1)^{i-1}\frac{\zeta{(2i)}}{(2n-2i+3)!\pi^{2i}}}=\frac{(n+1)}{(2n+3)!}
$$
For all $n\in\mathbb N_0$. Now we are ready to prove the formula $\zeta{(2n)}=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}B_{2n}$ with induction. With the equation above we can easily verify that it is true for $n=1$; therefore we assume that it holds for all $1≤i≤n$. The assertion $\zeta{(2n+2)}=(-1)^{n}\frac{(2\pi)^{2n+2}}{2(2n+2)!}B_{2n+2}$ is then equivalent to:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{(-1)^{i-1}\frac{(-1)^{i-1}\frac{(2\pi)^{2i}}{2(2i)!}B_{2i}}{(2n-2i+3)!\pi^{2i}}}=\frac{(n+1)}{(2n+3)!}\iff \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{\binom{2n+3}{2i}2^{2i-1}B_{2i}}=n+1\iff \sum_{i=0}^{2n+2} \binom{2n+3}{i}2^iB_i=0
$$
This identity can be proven by comparing the coefficients in the equation $\frac{e^x-1}{x}\frac{2x}{e^{2x}-1}=\frac{2}{e^x+1}$. Is this proof valid? Nonetheless, if it is, it isn't very elegant.

Here's a screenshot from the textbook. Okay, so we have a formula for the revenue R(P)=P*D(P). Let's say P increases by one dollar and the R changes. That's comprehensible. Why does R increase? Well, R(P) increases by 1*D(P), 'cause each of the D(P) units brings in an extra dollar. But D(P) is also a function and a change in P by one dollar changes the D like: D(P+1)-D(P), which is close to D'(P) That's also more or less clear. But after that I am completely lost. The (positive) loss due to a one dollar increase in the price per unit is then−P*D'(P), which must be subtracted from D(P) to obtain R'(P), as in equation. Why do we have have positive loss? What does it even mean? And why is this loss -P*D'(P)? Why negative? And why do we have to subtract it from D(P) to obtain R'(P)? I know that the derivative of R(P)=P D(P) is R'(P)=D(P)+P D'(P).

1323068,Looking for references related to an inequality in order statistics,"I was reading the paper ""on the minimum of several random variables"" . In example 10 item (ii) it states: Let $1\leq k\leq n$. Let $g_i,i\leq n$, be independent $N(0,1)$ Gaussian random variables. Then for $k\leq n/2$:
$$c\sqrt{\ln\frac{2n}{n+1-k}}\leq\mathbb{E}(k\text{-}\min_{i\leq n}|g_i|)\leq C\sqrt{\ln\frac{2n}{n+1-k}}$$
where $c,C$ are absolute constants. The author claimed that this is a well-known inequality so he didn't provide the proof. I am interested whether this inequality has a name and how this was proved. Especially I am interested in the proof techniques, since recently I was working on a project related to this topic, I would like to see whether or not similar result can be generalized to other distributions( e.g. sub-gaussian).

1323079,Equivalence relation on regular functions,"In this problem, consider $K$ an algebraic closed field and $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n_k$ an irreducible variety. Given an open Zariski $U\subset X$, we say that a function $\phi:U\rightarrow K$ is regular if $\phi = f/g$ for some $f,g\in K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ (in this case, $g$ is never zero in $U$). Now, the problem: fix $p\in X$, consider two open Zariski $U,V$ containing $p$ and two regular functions $\phi:U\rightarrow K$, $\psi:V\rightarrow K$. We can define a relation $(\phi, U)\sim (\psi,V)$ when there is an open Zariski $W\subset U\cap V$ such that $\phi=\psi$ in $W$. I want to prove that this relation is an equivalence relation. It's not hard to prove reflexivity and symmetry, but the transitivity is hard. Suppose $(\phi, U)\sim (\psi,V)$ and $\varphi:T\rightarrow K$ such that $(\psi, V)\sim (\varphi,T)$. I know there is some open Zariski $Z\subset V\cap T$ such that $\psi = \varphi$ in $Z$. Also I know that $p$ is inside $U,V,T$, but this doesn't guarantees that $U$ and $T$ have non empty intersection. Even if the intersection is non empty, I can't see why would exist an open Zariski inside $U\cap T$, so I'm stuck here. If is not to ask too much, I have another question. Why can't I just take $W=U\cap V$ when defining this relation? Thanks.","['algebraic-geometry', 'zariski-topology', 'commutative-algebra']"

Find the general solution for the following equation for $x(t)$. $$x''+ 9x = 2 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \cos(nt)/n^3$$ I can't find anything about this in my differential equations book; however it seems like a simple case of the linearity of solutions. Please do not feel like you must check the Algebra, etc but rather if the method of solving is correct. I will present my methodology of solving the problem; and would kindly ask if someone could tell me if I am correct as I have no solution provided. First I solve for the complementary solution of: $$x''+9x=0$$ whose solution is:
$x_c = C_1\cos(3t)+C_2\sin(3t)$ I proceed to solve for the particular solution corresponding to the constant 2:
$x_{p0}=A_0$ thus $9A=2$, and $A=2/9$. Next I solve for the n-th particular solution corresponding to $\cos(nt)$ keeping in mind the duplicity at $n=3$.
$x_{pn}=A_n\cos(nt)+B_n\sin(nt)$ from which it follows that the second derivative is:
$x_{pn}''=-n^2A_n\cos(nt)-n^2B_n\sin(nt)$ thus for the nth particular solution the differential equation is:
$-n^2A_n\cos(nt)-n^2B_n\sin(nt)+9(A_n\cos(nt)+B_n\sin(nt))=\cos(nt)/n^3$ it is obvious that $B_n$ should be zero since no $\sin(nt)$ exist on the right side; furthermore,
$-n^2A_n+9A_n=1/n^3$ thus $A_n=\frac 1{(9-n^2)n^3}$ for the case of n=3 the particular solution takes the form:
$x_{p3}=tA_3\cos(3t)+tB_3\sin(3t)$
then:
$x_{p3}''=\cos(3t)(6B_3-9tA_3)+\sin(3t)(-6A_3-9tB_3)$ putting this into the differential equation yields:
$$\cos(3t)(6B_3-9tA_3)+\sin(3t)(-6A_3-9tB_3)+9(\cos(3t)A_3+\sin(3t)B_3)=\frac{\cos(3t)}{n^3}$$ Again equating coefficients yields: $B_3=0$ and $A_3=1/162$ hence would the solution be:
$x=C_1\cos(3t)+C_2\sin(3t) + 2/9 + \frac {t\cos3t} {162} + \sum_{n=1,n \neq 3}^ \infty \frac {\cos(nt)} {(9-n^2)n^3}$?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

  left to right, the girls are in the order $g_1g_2g_3g_4g_5$. In how
  many ways can this be done if $g_1$ and $g_2$ are to be separated by
  atleast 3 boys, and there is at most one boy between $g_4$ and $g_5$. First take a look at this which shows the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that order matters: If you are too lazy to read it, it basically says that the number of ways to put $r$ distinct objects into $n$ distinct boxes such that the order in the boxes matters is given by $P^{n+r-1}_{r}$ The whole idea is to count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$ and then subract the number of arrangements where there are less than $3$ boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ (atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$). First count the arrangements where there is an arbitrary number of boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$ and atmost one between $g_4$ and $g_5$. If you arrange the girls as $\_g_1\_g_2\_g_3\_g_4g_5\_$, then the dashes can be treated as boxes where to put the boys. Observe that there is no dash between $g_4$ and $g_5$. Case 1: there is no object between $g_4$ and $g_5$. There are $P^{15}_{5}$ such arrangements. Case 2: There is one object between $g_4$ and $g_5$. There are $11\times P^{14}_{5}$ such arrangements. Thus, the total is $3003000$. Now, count the number of permutations where there are less than $3$ boys between $g_1$ and $g_2$. Case 1: $0$ objects between them. If there is no object between $g_4$ and $g_5$ you have $P^{14}_{4}$ and if there is you have $11\times P^{13}_{4}$, so in this case there are $212784$ arrangements. In the same manner for the cases where there are $1$ and $2$ objects between $g_1$ and $g_2$ you get, respectively, the values $11\times P^{13}_{4} + 11\times 10\times P^{12}_{4} = 1,519,684$ and $2\times {11\choose2}\times P^{12}_4 + 2\times{11\choose2}\times 9\times P^{11}_{4} = 3,920,400$ which alone is larger than $3003000$, so there is obviously a mistake.

1323141,Existence of diffeomorphism through convergence in Hausdorff distance,"I'm reading a book and have come across something that I cannot verify or fix.

After this the text reads ""For convenience, we let $\phi_j : \Omega \to \Omega_j$ be diffeomorphisms such that the $\phi_j$ converge to the identity in a suitable topology."" My question is why can we say that these diffeomorphisms exist or how can we tweak the assumption to make them exist. To illustrate my concern, here's an example that shows that, as stated, the above cannot be true. Let $B(a, r)$ denote the ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with center $a$ and radius $r$. Let $S_n = B(0, 1) - \overline{B(0, \frac{1}{n})}$.  Then $S_n$ converges to (or accumulates to) $B(0,1)$ in Hausdorff distance.  But for no $n$ are $S_n$ and $B(0,1)$ diffeomorphic, in fact for no $n$ are they homeomorphic since one can compute the homology groups for $S_n$ and $B(0,1)$ and see they are different.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'general-topology']"

1323537,Continuity of normalized displacement vector for a smooth closed curve,"I am currently working on chapter 3.12 of ""Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems"" by Lawrence Perko. I am stuck on the continuity of the function $g$ in Theorem 3. My work (up to the prove of continuity based on Perko with slightly different notation) so far: Suppose that $f\in C^1(E)$ where $E$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and that $E$ contains a cycle $\Gamma$ of the system $\dot{x}=f(x) \quad(1)$. At any point $x\in\Gamma$, define the unit vector $u(x)=f(x)/|f(x)|$. We can assume that $\Gamma$ lies in the first quadrant and is tangent to the $x$-axis in some point $(x_0,0),x_0>0$ (otherwise translate and rotate the axis). Let $\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ be the solution of $(1)$ through the point $(x_0,0)$ at time $t=0$. We can assume that $\Gamma$ is positively oriented and that the period of $\Gamma$ is equal to $1$, so
\begin{align*}\Gamma=\{\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))\in\mathbb{R}^2~|~0\leq t\leq 1\}.\end{align*} Let $T=\{(s,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2~|~0\leq s\leq t\leq 1\}$, then for $(s,t)\in T$ we define the vector field $g$ by
\begin{align*}&g(s,s)=u(\gamma(s)), & 0\leq s\leq 1 \\ &g(0,1)=-u(\gamma(0)), & \\ &g(s,t)=\frac{\gamma(t)-\gamma(s)}{|\gamma(t)-\gamma(s)|}, & 0\leq s < t \leq 1\end{align*} Now Perko states, that $g$ is continuous on $T$ and $g\neq 0$ for on $T$. It is clear that $g$ is continuous on $\tilde{T}:=T\setminus\{(s,t)\in T~|~s=t \vee (s,t)=(0,1)\}$. Let $(s_n,t_n)\rightarrow (s,s),0\leq s\leq 1$. One can show that
\begin{align*}g(s_n,t_n)=\frac{\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)}{|\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)|}=\frac{\frac{\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)}{t_n-s_n}}{\frac{|\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)|}{t_n-s_n}}\stackrel{s_n<t_n}{=}\frac{\frac{\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)}{t_n-s_n}}{\left|\frac{\gamma(t_n)-\gamma(s_n)}{t_n-s_n}\right|}\stackrel{n\to\infty}{\rightarrow} \frac{\dot{\gamma(s)}}{|\dot{\gamma(s)}|}\stackrel{\dot{\gamma}=f(\gamma)}{=}u(\gamma(s)).\end{align*}
I now have problems to prove the continuity of $g$ in $(0,1)$. I have uploaded a pdf with figures of the problem (is it possible to attach it directly to this post?), just by ""looking"" one would say that $g(s,t)\rightarrow -u(\gamma(0))$ as $(s,t)\rightarrow (0,1)$, but I don't find a way to really prove it.

Also excuse any misuse of terminology! Say I have two lines on a graph: Visually I can see that generally the grey line is lower than the red line. But how can I say this mathematically so that it results in a true or false? Standard Deviation If I apply standard deviation on the red line I can easily see if any points in the grey bar deviate from the range of the red. But how can I say that this generally happens for all the points? Is it about taking the average value of the grey line and seeing if that average value is within or outside the standard deviation of the red line?,"['statistics', 'standard-deviation']"

$$\int_C \frac{f_2}{(4-z)}dz = \frac{8-4}{4}=1$$ Then since it is negatively oriented we get, $-2\pi i \times (2+1)=-6\pi i$ But the answer is $-2\pi i$, what have I done wrong?","['contour-integration', 'complex-analysis', 'residue-calculus']"
1323582,Is a locally $\mathcal{C}$ space a direct limit of $\mathcal{C}$ spaces?,"Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of topological spaces (for example Hausdorff spaces, compact spaces, connected spaces, finite spaces, etc...), and let $X$ be a topological space. Is the following true? (L): $X$ is locally $\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $X$ is a direct limit of spaces belonging to $\mathcal{C}$. This question came to my mind when I realized that $\Bbb{R}$, as a topological space, is the direct limit of the system $\{ [-n,n] : n >0 \}$ where the maps are inclusions. All the spaces $[-n,n]$ are compact, and indeed $\Bbb{R}$ is locally compact. After that, I investigated a bit on the nature of being ""locally compact"". Suppose $X$ is locally compact. Then for every point $x \in X$ there exists a compact neighbourhood $A_x$ of $x$. Set $$\mathcal{A} = \{ A \subset X : A  \mbox{ is compact and $A$ has nonempty interior} \}$$ and partial order this family by inclusion. This is a direct system of compact spaces since the union of two compact spaces is compact $(*)$.
Then we can see that $X = \lim_{\to} \mathcal{A}$ simply checking that the universal property is satisfied. So (if I made no mistakes), I concluded that every locally compact space is a direct limit of compact spaces. Now, if I want to replace in the above argument ""compact"" with ""is in the class $\mathcal{C}$"", I realize that condition $(*)$ is not necessarily satisfied. And here I got stuck. Please, I would be very happy if I knew that (L) is true, at least for some particular cases (e.g. for locally compact spaces), but before I proceed my investigation I want to know if it is worth to continue.","['general-topology', 'category-theory']"

I have been able to prove the existence and uniqueness (see below) but I don't know how to prove $f$ is derivable or calculate $f'(0)$. How can I prove it? Proof of existence and uniqueness: Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$. The equation $$2x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x = a \qquad (\ast)$$ has at least one solution since $p(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x$ is an odd-degree polynomial. Suppose there were two different solutions $x_1, x_2$ for $(\ast)$. Then, by Rolle's theorem there exists $c \in (x_1, x_2)$ such that: $$p'(c) = 6x^2 - 6x + 6 = 0$$ But $\Delta_{p'} = 6^2 - 4 \cdot 6^2 < 0$, so $p'(c) = 0$ has no real solutions, which is a contradiction.

Then, by showing this operator is linear over $C^\infty$ functions, some argument involving bump functions implies the operator defines a tensor field. Usually this is followed by some remark about modules, giving a strong impression that something bigger is going on. On general relativity texts, there's an equivalent practice that involves showing the operator ""transforms correctly"".
