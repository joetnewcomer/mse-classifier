216360,Counting the number of surjections.,"How many functions from set $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ to $\{A,B,C\}$ are surjections? $n \geq 3$ Attempt I was hoping to count the number of surjections by treating $A,B,C$ like bins, and counting the number of ways to fill them with $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ such that no bins are empty. This is equivalent to putting two ""separator"" bars in between the $n$ numbers or $n-1 \choose 2$. However, I think I am missing a step here: prior to putting in the separator bars, I should permutate the $n$ elements. So, multiply by $n!$. The order of elements in the same bins do not matter. So I should be divided by the number of permutations of the elements in each bins. This is where I am stuck. Additional Info I made the question up myself.

216376,Universal cover via paths vs. ad hoc constructions,"I'm looking for some intuition regarding universal covers of topological spaces. $\textbf{Setup:}$ For a topological space $X$ with sufficient adjectives we can construct a/the simply connected covering space of it by looking at equivalence classes of paths at a given base point. We then can put a topology in the standard way done by Hatcher - an open set around an equivalence class of paths, say $[\gamma]$  is the set of $[\gamma\cdot\eta]$ where $\eta$ is a path starting at $\gamma(1)$ contained in $U$ open in $X$. Here are my questions: Q: I find this topological space, as constructed above, non-intuitive. Certainly I dont know how I would manipulate it and make topological arguments in it. What is the 'right' way of thinking about the topology here? Or is this construction useful solely for proving the existence of simply connected covers? Q: Often times it is tractable to construct a simply connected covering by ad-hoc methods (fancy guessing). The projective plane, torus, etc all spring to mind. By universality I know that the covering space obtained by any ad-hoc method is $\textit{the}$ universal covering space obtained by the above method, so there is an isomorphism of these two. Is there a standard way to see this isomorphism? Being really concrete, say in the cases of $\mathbb RP^2$, or $S^1\times S^1$.

  d(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} |\xi_i - \eta_i|, \qquad x = (\xi_i), y = (\eta_i).

216557,"Why isn't there interest in nontrivial, nondiscrete topologies on finite groups?","A topology on a group is required to be compatible with the group structure (multiplication must be a continuous map $G\times G\to G$ and inversion must be continuous). I've only ever seen the discrete topology referenced on finite groups, however (as e.g. subgroups of continuous matrix groups). Why isn't there any interest in nontrivial, nondiscrete topologies on finite groups? Is it because they are easy to classify, their study reduces to other areas of mathematics like graph theory, or that they haven't seen any external purpose elsewhere? Surely these topologies exist. For a subgroup $H\le G$ we can set all cosets of $H$ to be a base. We can speak of generating (group-compatible) topologies from subsets $X\subseteq G$; let the topology $\tau_G$ be the collection of all left and right translates of a given collection of subsets, as well as their unions and intersections (which will obviously be finite), and then their translates, etc. (this process will surely terminate because it acts like a monotone function being applied to the double power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(G))$.) Then we can ask for sufficient and necessary conditions for a family of subsets to generate the discrete topology. Other potentially interesting questions and answers: for a given family or handful of finite groups, we can ask for classification of their admissible topologies. So I for one think there are potentially interesting questions about nontrivial nondiscrete finite group topologies, but there does not seem to be any theory about it $-$ is there something I'm missing?","['topological-groups', 'general-topology', 'finite-groups', 'soft-question', 'group-theory']"

The idea is to ""guess"" integrals without explicit calculation, by just looking at their dimensions. It's been a good decade since I last touched integrals so please bear with me!

But the author also tells that $e^{-\alpha x^2}$ is dimensionless and thus derives dimension formula for $\alpha$: I don't understand why the $-\alpha x^2$ should be dimensionless. What if there's no $\alpha$ (or $\alpha=1$), in which case the exponent becomes $e^{-x^2}$ - will it have a dimension now? And if it won't, then why dimension of $\alpha$ should depend on  the dimension of $x$ at all? Also, a final question - if we accept that the only dimension which affects the integral in question is the dimension of $x$, then setting it to ""length"" means that the integral dimension is ""length"". But integrals compute areas, don't they? I think that in this case the integral $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$ will have a dimension of ""length x 1"" which is still area.

The proof begins with defining a norm on the space of test functions $D(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by \begin{equation}\|\psi\|=\int_{T^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\hat{\psi}(t+r\omega)|dm_d(t)d\sigma_d(\omega),\end{equation}where $r>0$ is fixed, $T^d$ is the torus in $\mathbb{C}^d$, $\sigma_d$ the Haar measure for this torus, and $m_d$ is the Lebesgue measure for $\mathbb{R}^d$. Then the proof goes on well, and this norm is used to prove the existence of a distribution, that is, our fundamental solution. However, I do not know how Rudin thinks about this strange norm. It reminds of the norm on Sobolev spaces but you do not have the integration over torus there. Can somebody give some reference or background information about this norm?

216816,Combinatorial identity related to the volume of a ball in $\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$,"Calculating the volume of a ball in $\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ in two different ways gives us the following formula: $$\sum_{i=0}^k {k \choose i} \frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1} = \frac{(k!)^2 2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}$$ Is there a more direct way to prove this identity? I'm interested if there is a more combinatorial or algebraic way to prove this. Given the sum on the left side, how would you find out the formula for it? Added: This is how I found the identity. The volume of an ball of radius $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ is given by the formula $$\mathscr{L}^{2k+1}(B(0,r)) = \frac{\pi^k k! 2^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}r^{2k+1}$$ and in $\mathbb{R}^{2k}$ by the formula $$\mathscr{L}^{2k}(B(0,r)) = \frac{\pi^k}{k!}r^{2k}$$ where $\mathscr{L}$ denotes Lebesgue measure. I was wondering if I could prove the formula for $\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ using the formula for $\mathbb{R}^{2k}$. With the formula for even dimension we can calculate \begin{align*}
\mathscr{L}^{2k+1}(B(0,r)) &= (\mathscr{L}^{2k} \times \mathscr{L})(B(0,r)) \\
&= \int_{[-r,r]} \mathscr{L}^{2k}(B(0,\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}))d \mathscr{L}(y) \\
&= \frac{\pi^k}{k!} 2 \int_0^r (r^2 - y^2)^k dy \\
&= \frac{\pi^k}{k!} 2r^{2k+1} \sum_{i=0}^k {k \choose i}\frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1}
\end{align*} Now equating the two formulas for $\mathscr{L}^{2k+1}(B(0,r))$ gives $$\sum_{i=0}^k {k \choose i} \frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1} = \frac{(k!)^2 2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}$$","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

Let $$\Phi=f(h)-\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}h^k$$ Then, there exists a $t$ in $(0,h)$ such that $$\Phi=f^{(n+1)}(t)\frac{h^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$$ and then uses this to prove. THEOREM (Taylor's Theorem) Let $h>0$.  Suppose $f^{(n)}$ continuous for $\mu \leq x\leq \mu+h$ and differentiable on $\mu <x<\mu+h$. Then there exists an $t$ such that $\mu<t<\mu +h $ and$$f(\mu+h)=\sum\limits_{v = 0}^n {\frac{{{f^{\left( v \right)}}\left( \mu  \right)}}{{v!}}} {h^v} + \frac{{{h^{n+1}}}}{{(n+1)!}}{f^{\left( n+1 \right)}}\left( t \right)$$ Now: I see the hypothesis are both the same, and they both address the remainder, but I can't see why Landau fixes $h>0$ and then gives a formula for this fixed $h$ and the $t$ (he actually names this $x$, but I found it a little conflicting) , while Spivak gives the remainder as a function of $x$ and a fixed $t$. Maybe it is just to make his (Landau's) proof simpler?

  processes, since they have a unique invariant distribution over the

  corresponds to an irreducible sub-space.) By ""ergodic processes"", I understand it to be the same as ""ergodic measure-preserving dynamic system"", if I am correct. As far as I know an ergodic measure-preserving dynamic system is a mapping $\Phi: T \times S \to S$ that satisfies a couple of properties, where $S$ is the state space, and $T$ is the time space. Sometimes there is a measure preserving mapping on $S$ that can generate the system by repeating itself. So I wonder how a Markov chain can be written as a mapping $\Phi: T \times S \to S$, and what the measure preserving mapping that generates the Markov chain is?

217223,"$\pi$, Dedekind cuts, trigonometric functions, area of a circle","(I should say at the outset that this question is broad, and may need splitting up. Although I ask several questions, I present them as one because they are not independent of one another, and I am seeking a unified answer.) My questions  are: How can we establish that the circumference $C$ and area $A$  of a circle of radius $r$ satisfy $C = 2\pi r$ and $A = \pi r^2$ for some constant, $\pi$? How can we prove that $\pi$ is an element of the real field (e.g., a Dedekind cut)? How can we prove (perhaps trivial, if the above are satisfied) that there are real functions $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which have the usual analytic properties, and also satisfy the usual geometric intuition? It seems like most calculus textbooks sort of weasel out on these questions. Usually, they ignore the first two questions pretty much completely, and their derivation on the third point is a filling-out of the following outline: (1) Define $\sin(x)$ as height of triangle of central angle $x$ inscribed in the unit circle, where $x$ is in radians, and $\cos(x)$ as the length of its base. Assume the usual values for these functions at $k(\frac{\pi}{2}), k \in \mathbb{N}$. (2) Notice, by assuming (a) that $A = \pi r^2$ and $C = 2\pi r$, and (b) that the area of a sector is proportionate to the length of arc subtended by the angle on the circumference, that the area $S$ of a sector of angle $x$ in a unit circle is $\frac{x}{2}$, since $$\frac{S}{\pi r^2} = \frac{x}{2 \pi r}, r = 1 \implies S = \frac{x}{2}$$
(Apparently, assumption (b) is Euclid VI 33 . I haven't studied the proof, though.) (3) Prove, using a geometric argument, that $\frac{\sin(x)}{2} < \frac{x}{2} < \frac{\tan(x)}{2}$ for $x \in [0,\frac{\pi}{2})$. Deal similarly (not identically) with $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, 0]$. Prove that we always have $1 > \frac{\sin(x)}{x} > \cos(x)$ on $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$. (4) Derive (by a geometric argument, as done here ) the usual angle addition formulas. (5) Noting that $|\sin(x)| < |x|$ (geometrically), conclude that $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin(x) = 0$. Use the identity - derived from (4) - that $$\cos(x) = 1 - 2\sin^2(\frac{x}{2}) = (1 - \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{x}{2}))(1 + \sqrt{2}\sin(\frac{x}{2}))$$ and the product theorem for limits to conclude that $\lim_{x \to 0} \cos(x) = 1$. (6) Use the ""Squeeze Theorem"" and (3) to prove that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x) - 1}{x} = 0$. Use (4) and (5) to establish continuity at all other values - e.g., $$\lim_{h \to 0} \sin(x_0 + h) = \lim_{h \to 0}\sin(x_0)\cos(h) + \sin(h)\cos(x_0) = \sin(x_0)$$ (7) Now prove that $\sin(x), \cos(x)$ are differentiable. A notably different approach is that of Spivak's Calculus . Spivak tacitly assumes that the first question has been answered, and notices that in that case, $$ \pi = 2\int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx $$ which resolves the second question, albeit not too directly. Also assuming that the area of a sector of an angle of $x$ radians is $\frac{x}{2}$, he defines $$ A(x) = \frac{x \sqrt{1- x^2}}{2} + \int_{x}^{1} \sqrt{1-t^2} dt$$ The area function is a function of the $x$-coordinate, not an angle $x$; it tends from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $0$ as $x$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. However, $\forall x \in [0, \pi]$, we have $\exists !y \in [-1, 1]: A(y) = \frac{x}{2}$; this $y$ we set as $\cos(x)$, and we define $\sin(x) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(x)}$. (The uniqueness of the value of $\cos(x)$ is guaranteed by the fact that $A(x)$ is decreasing and continuous.) The remainder of Spivak's derivation is about extending these functions (by symmetry) to the rest of $\mathbb{R}$. Although I am familiar with these derivations, they are rather prominently silent about the first question; I've never seen any answer to that question which impressed me as rigorous. I am not at all sure that there is an actual cut which one can write down (i.e., in set-builder notation, as an explicit subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ in the usual way) for $\pi$.","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'analysis']"

Can any one give me a hint for this problem? I was considering the maximum $p$ of function $|x|^2$ on $M$, then near $p$, $M$ is ""wrapped"" by some $S^n$ and has the same tangent space as $S^n$. But I am stuck there. I have made some progress: We consider the functions $L_q(x)=|x-q|^2$. Then we have a maximum $p$ of $L_q$ and we fix the unit vector $v=\frac{p-q}{|p-q|}$ throughout, so $v$ is the normal vector at $p$. Now if we set $q(t)=p+tv$, then when $t\leq-|p-q|$, $p$ is always the maximum of function $L_{q(t)}$ (this is true if we draw a ball at $q(t)$ with radius $|p-q(t)|$, then all $M$ is contained in this ball). Therefore when $t$ sufficiently tends to $-\infty$, the Hessian $L_{q(t)}$ is always semi-positive definite. Now if we fix a coordinate neighborhood aroud $p$, then Hessian matrix $H$ of $L_{q(t)}$ at $p$ is given by $H=2(F-tS)$ where $F,S$ are the first and second fundamental forms of $M$ at $p$. So we conclude that $S$ has to be semi-positive definite. But how can we move further to say $S$ is positive definite?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
