3384749,Triple integral for the volume of the cap of the solid sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 10$ cut off by the plane $z=1$?,"The question asks me to formulate a triple integral for the volume of the cap of the solid sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 10$ cut off by the plane $z=1$ ? Here's the integral I formulated as an answer (I used cylindrical coordinates): $$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\sqrt{10} \int_1^\sqrt{10-r^2} r \ dz \ dr \ d\theta$$ However, apparently the correct answer is: $$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^3 \int_1^\sqrt{10-r^2} r \ dz \ dr \ d\theta$$ The only difference is the $3$ , but where does the $3$ come from? $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 10$ implies we're dealing with a sphere with radius $\sqrt{10}$ . I have no idea where the $3$ is coming from really. Any help is appreciated.","['integration', 'cylindrical-coordinates', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'multiple-integral']"
3384774,Longest consecutive runs of sums of $k$-subsets of first $n$ primes,"Table of contents [ $1.$ ] Definition [ $2.$ ] Implication. (Motivation.) [ $3.$ ] Question. & Computed data. [ $4.$ ] Solutions of simplified variations. [ $5.$ ] Progress on solving the question. [ $6.$ ] Characterization of critical region? [ $1.$ ]  Definition. $T(k, n)$ = length of the longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ primes. Where $n\ge 0$ and $k=0,\dots,n$ and specially $T(0,
n)=T(n, n)=1$ . Notice that this triangle is symmetric: $T(k,n)=T(n-k,n)$ . Example: If $n=4$ , we have first four primes: {2,3,5,7} . Then for example, all possible $k=2$ subsets are: {2,3},{2,5},{2,7},{3,5},{3,7},{5,7} , and their sums are, when sorted: "" 5,7,8,9,10,12 "". The longest consecutive streak there is "" 7,8,9,10 "", of length four $\implies T(2,4)=4$ . [ $2.$ ] Implication. (Motivation.) $T(k,n)$ is the length of longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ primes. Let $t_{k,n}$ be the smallest (first) sum of this longest consecutive run. It holds: If $N$ is the number such that all prime gaps below it are $\le T(k,n)$ , then all numbers in the interval $[t_{k,n}+p_{n+1},N]$ are ""trivially"" a sum of exactly $k+1$ distinct primes, where $p_{n+1}$ is the $(n+1)$ th prime. Example: If $(k=9,n=12)$ , we get $T(9, 12)=42$ and $t_{k,n}=138$ , where $p_{13}=41$ . All prime gaps below $N=15683$ are $36\lt42$ . This means all numbers $\in[179,15683]$ can be ""trivially"" represented as sums of exactly $10$ distinct primes. Alternatively, we just simply observed that $9$ -combinations of first $12$ primes are sufficient to cover all prime gaps in the range $[179,15683]$ , and thus reach any number in that range when combined with some prime $p_{(i\gt 12)}$ , since the set of those combinations contains $42$ consecutive values, which is more than enough, since largest prime gap in that range is $36\lt 42$ . This example was used in an answer to the linked question . You may notice that this is a generalization of the linked answer, which was an inspiration for defining $T(k,n)$ . We could now continue for example, to observe same $k$ but different $n$ , to cover more ranges of numbers that can be ""trivially"" represented as a sum of exactly $k+1$ distinct primes. [ $3.$ ] Question. & Computed data. Is a ""closed form"" for calculating (determining) the values of $T(k, n)$ possible? Due to symmetry $T(k, n)=T(n-k, n)$ , we can assume that $k\le \lfloor n/2 \rfloor +1$ . We already specially defined $k=0$ . Moving on, it is not hard to see: $T(1,n)=1;n=1$ , and $T(1,n)=2,n\ge2$ . $T(2,n)=1,2,4,4;n=2,3,4,5$ , and $T(2,n)=5,n\ge 6$ . But for $k= 3$ already, a closed form does not appear to be easy: $$T(3,n)=1,2,4,6,10,18,22,22,40,42,46,60,66,70,70,70,100,100,106,120,132,\dots$$ Computed data for $n=0,\dots,100$ (rows) and all $k=0,\dots,n$ (columns) is listed here . - Thanks to vujazzman's suggestion of using dynamic programming, instead of re-calculating every step over and over, where I was initially wasting time. Note that, if a ""closed form"" is possible, it must depend on prime gaps in some way. [ $4.$ ] Solutions of simplified variations. Lets generalize the definition, to use some set $\mathbb A$ , instead of the set of primes $\mathbb P$ . That is, define $T(k,n;\mathbb A)$ where $\mathbb A$ is some countable set of natural numbers, as the longest consecutive run of sums of $k$ -subsets of first $n$ elements of the given set. Then, for example, if we use natural numbers, we have a simple closed form: $$T(k, n; \mathbb N)=k(n-k)+1$$ Another example, let $D=\{2,3,5,7,9,\dots\}$ be the set of odd numbers $\gt 1$ and $2$ . Then: $$ T(k, n; D)= 2[k(n-k)-n+2]$$ For $k,n\gt 0$ . Otherwise, for either $n=0$ or $k=0$ , we define it as $1$ . We can now keep removing numbers from the last example. That is, define $\mathbb P|_{r}$ as the set of first $r$ primes, and all numbers not divisible by them. Then, $ D = \mathbb P|_{1}$ , and $\mathbb P|_{\infty}=\mathbb P$ . I've looked into finding closed forms of some $\mathbb P|_{r},r\in \mathbb N$ , and observed that there are patterns related to finite subsets of prime gaps. (Based on computed terms.) This motivated be to write $T(k, n)$ triangle as a $m\times m$ table, then transform it by subtracting consecutive terms horizontally and vertically. This is discussed in the next section. [ $5.$ ] Progress on solving the question. We define a $m\times m$ table $T$ , as a matrix obtained from $k=0,\dots,m$ and $n=k,\dots,k+m$ values of $T(k,n)$ . Let $i,j=0,\dots,m$ be the indices of rows/columns. Now, we get $T'$ by taking the differences of consecutive terms horizontally (vertically) of $T$ , then $T''$ by taking differences of consecutive terms vertically (horizontally) of $T'$ . We can now use $T''$ to reconstruct $T'$ to reconstruct $T$ , and finally to get $T(k,n)$ . Now we want to solve for a pattern in terms of the table (matrix) $T''$ . Most of its values are now given explicitly as sequences of consecutive prime gaps , whose starting value (offset) is given by the row (column). A closed form seems possible! But there is a problem. There exists a ""critical"" region of terms which are neither trivial (zero), nor given by prime gaps. These terms are the only thing now preventing a formulation of a ""closed form"". I have made a script to compute and color $m=75$ table $T''$ in excel: (click to open, then click to zoom in, to see exact values, in this 2400x2400 picture of the table) Where $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ region are the terms given by prime gaps, $\color{green}{\text{green}}$ are trivial (zero) terms, and black terms represent the ""critical region"", where I do not see any clear patterns. My question here, now boils down to, Can we find a ""closed form"" for the ""critical region"" terms? (To combine it with the pattern for prime gaps, and obtain a ""closed form"" pattern for the entire table $T''$ .) That is, can we calculate the terms in and near the critical region, without relying on computing the longest runs of subsets? - And instead, calculate them by defining pattern sequences, similar to prime gaps? (Prime gaps exactly represent the red region - can we solve the black region?). [ $6.$ ] Characterization of critical region? If we can't easily fully characterize the critical region, are there things that we can say about it? I have made some observations about the critical region, but I wasn't able to characterize it fully. Let ""strips"" refer to rows/columns of $T''$ . I have observed that: Sum invariant of strips. Looks like, the sums over individual strips (rows/columns), are invariant, regardless if terms belong to expected prime gap pattern or to the critical region pattern. That is, we know the critical region terms differ from expected prime gaps. - Now, we also know that they still maintain the sum of those expected prime gaps. For example, observing the included table image, in column $\text{G}$ we have an example of an isolated part of a critical strip, with values $(10,0)$ , in $18,19$ th rows, instead of the expected prime gaps $(4,6)$ . But both, sum to the same expected value: $10+0=4+6$ . Or another example, in column $\text{E}$ , in rows $15-21$ , we have ciritcal terms $(20,12,-18,0,20,-4,0)$ instead of expected prime gaps $(2,6,4,2,6,4,6)$ , and both sequences sum to $30$ . This seems to hold in all strips, and in individual isolated parts, if we observe a sufficient amount of surrounding terms. This means, we could assume all critical terms are prime gaps, and get a closed form approximation for $T''$ , that will only be incorrect in the critical region. The only exceptions seem to be, parts where critical region is ""very mixed"" with the trivial region. This means, we can establish a ""closed form"" $T(k, n)$ approximation, that is ( ""almost"" ) exactly correct only if $k$ is sufficiently close to $n$ . (Which is most of the time, if you observe the ratio of areas of red and black regions in the included table image.) We still don't have an exact ""closed form"", that is, a full characterization of $T(k, n)$ , but, we can now analyse the asymptotics of $T(k, n)$ , with such an approximation. What remains, is, to characterize the beginnings and endings of isolated critical region strips, and structure inside them. - So far, I only know about the invariant sum property .","['number-theory', 'computational-number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'prime-numbers']"

3384840,Isotropic tensor functions that map antisymmetric tensors to zero (Navier-Stokes derivation),"I'm going through Chorin and Marsden's derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations in A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics . There are three assumptions made about the Cauchy stress tensor $\pmb\sigma$ (which I am paraphrasing): 1) $\pmb \sigma$ depends only on the velocity gradient $\nabla \mathbf{u}$ . So written as a linear transformation $\pmb \sigma = \pmb \sigma (\nabla \mathbf{u})$ 2) $\pmb \sigma$ is an isotropic tensor function (rotationally invariant) so that $$\pmb \sigma (U \ \nabla \mathbf u \ U^T)= U \ \pmb \sigma (\nabla \mathbf u) U^T$$ for any proper orthogonal matrix $U$ . 3) $\pmb \sigma$ is symmetric. After stating these assumptions, they conclude that because of 3), it follows from 1) and 2) that $\pmb \sigma$ can depend only on the symmetric part of $\nabla \mathbf u$ . In other words, if you write $$\nabla \mathbf u = D +W$$ where $D=\frac 1 2 (\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla \mathbf u^T) $ (the symmetric part of $\nabla \mathbf u$ ) and $W = \frac 1 2 (\nabla \mathbf u - \nabla \mathbf u^T) $ (the antisymmetric part of $\nabla \mathbf u$ ), then $\pmb \sigma (W)= \mathbf 0$ , i.e. $\pmb \sigma$ maps antisymmetric second order tensors to the zero second order tensor. I am not sure how the above argument works and would appreciate some help in seeing it. Note : I've seen arguments which use the fact that $\pmb \sigma$ must satisfy in component form $$\sigma_{ij}= -p \delta_{ij} + C_{ijrs}  u_{r,s}$$ where $p$ is the pressure, and it ends up that the fourth order tensor $\mathbf C$ must take a special form (because it is isotropic). From this special form, you can end up deducing that $\pmb \sigma$ maps antisymmetric second order tensors to the zero second order tensor. I'm interested in seeing an argument that doesn't rely on the component analysis and also doesn't jump immediately to the special representation of isotropic second order tensor functions in terms of its principal invariants.","['tensors', 'matrices', 'linear-transformations', 'physics', 'fluid-dynamics']"
3384861,Proving that the set of rational numbers between 0 and 1 is disconnected.,"Show that the set of rational numbers between $0$ and $1$ $(A = \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1])$ is disconnected.

3384900,What does a linear transformation of $\mathbf{C}^2$ look like?,"This is a math question, but is based on a physics topic I'm trying to develop an intuition for. Let me know if this question would be better placed in physics. What I know: The ""characteristic matrix"" in thin film optics relates the E and H field amplitudes before and after passing through a thin film of material. For a single layer on a substrate, the equation is: $$
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    E_b \\ H_b 
    \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(\delta) & i(1/y_1)\sin(\delta) \\

    \end{pmatrix} 
     \begin{pmatrix} 
     E_a \\ H_a 
     \end{pmatrix}
$$ where $E_a,H_a$ are the field amplitudes at the film/substrate interface, $E_b,H_b$ are the field amplitudes at the air/film interface, $\delta$ = the phase thickness of the material, $y_1$ = characteristic admittance of the thin film. It can also be written in terms of the substrate admittance by normalizing to $E_a$ : $$
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    B \\ C 
    \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos(\delta) & i(1/y_1)\sin(\delta) \\

    \end{pmatrix} 
     \begin{pmatrix} 
     1 \\ y_{sub}

$$ I was playing around with the matrix, when I realized: if you view $M$ as a linear transformation of $\mathbf{C}$ , it corresponds to a pure rotation and scaling of the basis vectors (1,0) and (0, $ i$ ). In other words, for vector $\mathbf{v}$ in the complex plane, $M\mathbf{v}$ would rotate $\mathbf{v}$ by $\delta$ and then it's components would both be scaled by $y_1$ and $(1/y_1)$ . See below for how the basis vectors rotate while staying normal to one another for $\delta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ : $$

     \begin{pmatrix}

$$ I thought this was a really interesting geometric interpretation of what this matrix was doing, until I realized that the vectors $(E_a, H_a)$ or $(1, Y_{sub})$ have complex components themselves and therefore don't exist in $\mathbf{C}$ , but actually in $\mathbf{C}^2$ or $\mathbf{R}^4$ . What I don't know: So my questions now are, what does a linear transformation look like in $\mathbf{C}^2$ ? Does my pure rotation + scaling idea still make sense for this matrix?

3384971,Is a graph being bipartite an isomorphic variant?,"Hints only. My claim is yes. Let's say there's two graphs, A and B. Assuming A is bipartite, A can then be split up into two different graphs a1 and a2. There may be edges between vertices in a1 and a2, but not between members of the same group (no a1 vertice is connected to another vertice in a1). Isomorphism is a one-to-one and onto function by nature, so every element in A is uniquely related to an element in B. That being said, we can split up graph B into two parts as well - b1 (the set of vertices related to by elements in a1) and b2 ( the set of vertices related to by elements in b2). Since relationships between vertices are preserved, every element in b1 should therefore be connected only to elements in b2, and not with each other thus making it a bipartite graph.

3385011,Definitions of Measurability: Outer-inner measure convergence vs. Caratheodory criterion,"If we are looking over subsets of $\mathbb R$ and considering the outer measure defined exactly as $$\mu^*(A) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_k) \text{ where the $I_k$ are open intervals such that } A\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \right\}$$ and inner measure to be $$\mu_*(A) = \sup\left\{\mu^*(F) \text{ where the $F$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb R$ such that } F\subset A \right\}$$ then measurability in the sense of Lebesgue: $A$ is measurable if $\color{red}{\mu^*(A)=\mu_*(A)}$ is equivalent to the Caratheodory criterion: $A$ is measurable if $\color{red}{\mu^*(T) = \mu^*(T\cap A) + \mu^*(T\cap A^C)}$ for all test sets $T\subset \mathbb R$ See the proof from page 41-45 of this pdf: http://www.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/212a/11.pdf ; definitions and preceding theorems are found pages 1-40). First question $\color{red}{\text{STILL OPEN}}$ (perhaps refer to Nate’s comment below)?: If these two definitions are in fact equivalent, has anyone tried proving the Caratheodory Extension Theorem without the Caratheodory criterion , i.e. from scratch using outer and inner measure, or at least the equivalent definition of $\color{red}{\mu(G\setminus F)<\epsilon \text{ for some } G\supset A\supset F}$ (the ""inner-outer"" characterization from the Harvard pdf)? If so, could you provide a rundown of the proof (or a link to some article)? If it doesn't work generally, how about in the specific case where outer measure is defined the way I defined it above (e.g. as in the proof presented here, page 28 of the pdf: https://www.stat.washington.edu/jaw/COURSES/520s/521/bk521reJaw2012.pdf )? And second question $\color{red}{\text{(resolved I believe by the comment by Daniel Fischer)}}$ : Consider a weaker criterion than Caratheodory's: I just want that $\mu^*(X) = \mu^*(X\cap A) + \mu^*(X\cap A^C)$ for just the ""biggest set"" $X$ (I'm talking about the set for which $A^C=X\setminus A$ for all $A$ , i.e. the universal set; assume also that $\mu(X)$ is not infinite).

3385020,Examine my proof: A bijection exists between any two finite nonempty sets that share the same number of elements,"I was told to prove or disprove that if the two finite, nonempty sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same number of elements, then there is a one-to-one function from each element of $X$ to each element of $Y$ .

Assumption: There is a bijection between the sets $A$ and $B$ , and $A$ and $B$ are finite, nonempty and have the same number of elements. Inductive Step: Therefore, $A\cup\{x\}$ and $B\cup\{y\}$ have a bijection if $x\not\in A$ and $y\not\in B$ .

With it, a bijection $g$ and $g^{-1}$ can be constructed between $A\cup\{x\}$ and $B\cup\{y\}$ . If $a\in A\cup\{x\}$ and $b\in B\cup\{y\}$ , then $g$ is defined as follows: $g(a) = f(a)$ if $a\neq x$ $g(a) = y$ if $a=x$ $g^{-1} (b) = f^{-1} (b)$ if $b\neq y$ $g^{-1} (b) = x$ if $b=y$ Then $y$ has only one input in $A$ that points to it, so $g$ is one-to-one. Exactly the same can be said about $g^{-1}$ . $x$ has only one input in $B$ , so $g^{-1}$ is one-to-one as well. Lastly, since $g(x)=y$ , and $g^{-1} (y) = x$ , $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverses, $g$ and $g^{-1}$ are inverses.

3385147,"$sup \{ \mu (B): B \subset A, B \in K, \mu(B) < \infty \}$ is a measure","I'd like to prove that $\mu(A)^* = sup\{\mu (B): B \subset A, B \in K, \mu(B) < \infty \}$ is a measure, where $(X, K, \mu)$ is a measure room and $\mu^*: K \rightarrow [0; \infty]$ . Proof: It's clear that $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ Then, I would continue as follows: Let $A$ be such that $\mu^*(A) < \infty$ and let $B \subset A$ be a measurable set such that $\mu(B) = \mu^*(A).$ Then $$\mu^*(A \setminus B) = \mu^*(A) - \mu^*(B) = 0.$$ For the previous equalities to be true, we need the assumption $\mu^*(A) < \infty$ . This is in general not true otherwise, indeed one can consider $A = \mathbb{R}$ and $B = (0,\infty)$ . Then $\mu(A) = \mu(B) = \infty$ , but clearly $$\mu(A \setminus B) = \mu((-\infty,0)) = \infty.$$ This shows that $A \setminus B$ is measurable since by the Caratheodory condition sets of outer measure $0$ are measurable. To conclude the argument it is enough to notice that $A$ belongs to the $\sigma$ -algebra of measurable sets since it can be written as the union of two measurable sets: $$A = B \cup (A \setminus B).$$ The result is not true in general if $\mu^*(A) = \infty$ . Indeed, let $C \subset (-1,0)$ be a non -measurable set and consider $B = (0,\infty)$ and $A = B \cup C$ . Is this a plausible proof?","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"
3385196,A generalization of the abc-conjecture?,"For a natural number $a$ define $X_a := \{a/k| 1\le k \le a \}$ .
Then it  is not difficult to show that $|X_a \cap X_b| = \gcd(a,b)$ .
Using this one can define similarities over the natural numbers, using similarities which are defined over finite sets, for example from the Encyclopedia of Distances, replacing $|X_a \cap X_b|$ with $\gcd(a,b)$ and $|X_a|$ with $a$ . Example of such similarities are: 1) $s_{Si}(a,b) = \frac{\gcd(a,b)}{\min(a,b)}$ =  Simpson similarity 2) $s_{BB}(a,b) = \frac{\gcd(a,b)}{\max(a,b)}$ =  Braun,Blanquet similarity 3) $s_{J}(a,b) = \frac{\gcd(a,b)}{a+b-\gcd(a,b)}$ =  Jaccard similarity 4) $s_{S}(a,b) = \frac{2\gcd(a,b)}{a+b}$ = Sorensen similarity 5) $s_{Cos}(a,b) = \frac{\gcd(a,b)^2}{ab}$ = Squared Cosine similarity They all ( $s$ is a similarity from above) have these properties: i) For all $a,b$ we have $s(a,b) \in \mathbb{Q}$ ii) For all $a,b,m$ we have $s(ma,mb) = s(a,b)$ iii) There exists a natural number $S$ such that for all $a,b$ we have $\frac{S}{s(a,b)} \in \mathbb{N}$ iv) $s(1,1)=1$ The  point iii) is not fullfilled for example by the Kulczynski similarity: $s_K(a,b) = \frac{(a+b)\gcd(a,b)}{2ab}$ To not repeat the definitions I will call similarities on natural numbers with $i)-iv)$ for short $\gcd$ -similarities. Let $s$ be a gcd similarity. Then $s$ is called reducible if there exist gcd-similarities $s_1,s_2$ such that for all $a,b$ we have: $$\frac{s(a,b)}{S} = \frac{s_1(a,b)}{S_1} \frac{s_2(a,b)}{S_2}$$ ,
where $S,S_1,S_2$ are minimal numbers with property iii). Otherwise $s$ is callled irreducible . For instance: $s_{Cos} = s_{Si} \cdot s_{BB}$ , hence $s_{Cos}$ is reducible. I could prove that the Simpson (min), Braun-Blanquet (max), Jaccard and Sorensen similiarties are irreducible. Why is this interesting anyway? This irreducible similarties play a role in the formulation of the abc-conjecture, which could be a coincidence of course, which is why I am asking this question, to find out if it is a coincidence or not: Let $s_1 = s_{S}, s_2 = s_{Si}, s_3 = s_{BB}, S_1 = 2, S_2 = 1, S_3 = 1$ . If $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ , such that we have (""pairwise-gcd-assumption""): $$ \gcd( \frac{S_i}{s_i(a,b)}, \frac{S_j}{s_j(a,b)}) = 1, \text{ for } i \neq j, 1 \le i,j \le 3$$ Then the abc-conjecture is equivalent to:
For all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $K$ such that for all $a,b$ satisfying the pairwise-gcd-assumption, we have: $$\max_{i} \{ \frac{S_i}{s_i(a,b)}\} < K \text{rad}( \prod_{1 \le i \le 3} \frac{S_i}{s_i(a,b)} )^{1+\epsilon}$$ Also notice that if $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are such as above, and $d(a,b) = 1-s_1(a,b)s_2(a,b)s_3(a,b)$ , then it seems like $d$ can be embedded in Euclidean Space, which is a very strong condition, and very unusual. My question is, if you can help me test the related conjectures numerically for $\epsilon = 1, K_{\epsilon} = 2$ : Here is some Sage Code which I have used to test it. It would be nice, if you pick a specific $s = s_1 s_2 s_3$ , $s_i \in \{ s_S,s_{Si},s_{BB},s_{J} \}$ and test the corresponding (there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ of them) conjecture to find counterexamples.)

of dimension $k$ if for every $p \in S$ there is a coordinate neighborhood $(U,f) = (U,x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of $p$ in the maximal atlas of $N$ such that $U \cap S$ is defined
by the vanishing of $n−k$ of the coordinate functions. By renumbering the coordinates,
we may assume that these $n−k$ coordinate functions are $x_{k+1},\dots,x_n$ .
We call such a chart $(U,f)$ in $N$ an adapted chart relative to $S$ . On $U \cap S$ , $f =
(x_1, . . . ,x_k,0, . . . ,0)$ . More concretely, $$f(U\cap S) = f(U) \cap (\mathbb{R}^k \times \{0_{n-k}\})$$ Let $f_S : U\cap S→\mathbb{R}^k$ be the restriction of the first $k$ components of $f$ to $U \cap S$ , that is, $f_S = (x_1, . . . ,x_k)$ .
Note that $(U\cap S,f_S)$ is a chart for $S$ in the subspace topology. My notes then say that if we put the subspace topology on $S$ and the atlas $\{(U\cap S, f_S)\}$ , then $S$ becomes a smooth manifold with as maximal atlas the unique atlas containing $\{(U\cap S, f_S)\}$ . I'm trying to prove this (Tu's book contains a proof, but this seems easier). Here is my idea: Clearly $U \cap S$ is open in $S$ , because $U$ is open in $M$ . Define $\operatorname{pr}: f(U \cap S) \to pr(f(U \cap S)): (x_1, \dots, x_n) \mapsto (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ , thus the projection that forgets the last $n-k$ coordinates. Note that on the given domain and codomain, $pr$ is bijective with $$\operatorname{pr}^{-1}(x_1, \dots, x_k) = (x_1, \dots, x_k, 0, \dots, 0)$$ Then, observe that $f_S = \operatorname{pr} \circ f$ . Clearly, $pr$ is a $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism on the given domain and codomain, and thus $f_S$ is a homeomorphism as composition of homeomorphisms. I also have a proof that $f_S(U \cap S)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ , but to save space I won't include it here. Thus, it remains to prove that any two charts $f_S: U \cap S\to \mathbb{R}^k, g_S: U \cap S \to \mathbb{R}^k$ are compatible. This is clear, because on $f_S(U \cap V \cap S)$ we have $$g_S \circ f_S^{-1} = (\operatorname{pr}^g \circ g) \circ (\operatorname{pr}^f \circ f)^{-1} = \operatorname{pr}^f \circ (g \circ f^{-1}) \circ \operatorname{pr}^f$$ which is $C^\infty$ , as composition of $C^\infty$ maps.

For example, if $I=\{1\}$ , then (I dropped the indices for simplicity) $$k(x,y)k(y,x)\le q(x)q(y)|\sigma(x,y)|^2\;\;\;\text{for all }x,y\in E\tag4$$ and hence $$\int\lambda({\rm d}x)\int\lambda({\rm d}y)k(x,y)k(y,x)\le\int\lambda'({\rm d}x')\int\lambda'({\rm d}y')|\sigma'(x',y')|^2\tag5.$$ The general case looks quite complicated: $$k(x,y)k(y,x)=\sum_{i\in I}\sum_{i'\in I}\sum_{j\in I}\sum_{j'\in I}\alpha_{ij}(x,y)\tau_{ij}(x,y)\alpha_{i'j'}(y,x)\tau_{i'j'}(y,x)\tag6$$ for all $x,y\in E$ and \begin{equation}\begin{split}&\alpha_{ij}(x,y)\tau_{ij}(x,y)\alpha_{i'j'}(y,x)\tau_{i'j'}(y,x)\\&\;\;\;\;=\left.\begin{cases}\displaystyle w_i(x)q_j(y)\wedge\frac{w_j(y)p(y)q_i(x)}{p(x)}&\text{, if }p(x)>0\\w_i(x)q_j(y)&\text{, otherwise}\end{cases}\right\}\sigma_{ij}(x,y)\\&\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\left.\begin{cases}\displaystyle w_{i'}(y)q_{j'}(x)\wedge\frac{w_{j'}(x)p(x)q_{i'}(y)}{p(y)}&\text{, if }p(y)>0\\w_{i'}(y)q_{j'}(x)&\text{, otherwise}\end{cases}\right\}\sigma_{i'j'}(y,x)\\&\;\;\;\;\le w_i(x)q_j(y)\sigma_{ij}(x,y)w_{i'}(y)q_{j'}(x)\sigma_{i'j'}(y,x)\end{split}\tag7\end{equation} for all $x,y\in E$ and $i,i',j,j'\in E$ . Maybe we can estimate this and end up with an integrability assumption as in $(5)$ , e.g. $$\sum_{i\in I}\sum_{j\in I}\int\lambda'({\rm d}x')\lambda'({\rm d}y')\sigma_{ij}(x',y')<\infty\tag8.$$","['measure-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'probability-theory']"

3385879,Curves have finite automorphism group (proof by D. Litt),"I am trying to understand the proof of Proposition 1 from Daniel Litt's one pager CURVES HAVE FINITE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \ge 2$ , over a field $k$ . Proposition 1 .  The automorphism group of $X$ is finite. Proof of Proposition . wlog $k = \bar{k}$ (???). Choose $n$ so that $\omega_X ^{\otimes n}$ is very ample (recall $\omega_X$ is canonical sheaf of $X$ ), and let $$\iota: X \to \mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n}) = \mathbb{P}^N _k $$ be the natural closed embedding. The action of $\text{Aut}(X)$ (which we view as an abstract group -this proof will not use the representability of the automorphism functor) extends to an action on $\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})$ via pullback
  of differentials; (???) $\iota$ is equivariant for this action. As the action of $Aut(X)$ on $X$ is faithful, we obtain an injection $$\kappa:Aut(X) \to PGL(\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})).$$ Let $G$ be the closure of the image of $Aut(X)$ in $PGL(\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n}))$ : Suppose for the sake of contradiction
  that $Aut(X)$ is infinite; then $G$ has positive dimension (and also acts on $X$ ???). Consider non-zero $v \in T_e G$ .
  We claim that the vector field on $X$ induced by $v$ is non-zero (in characteristic zero this is clear, but in
  characteristic $p$ an argument is required - see the remark at the bottom of the page). Indeed, suppose $v \in G(k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2)$ acted trivially on $X_{k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2}$ . Then the action on $\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})_{\epsilon]/\epsilon^2}$ (induced
  by pullback) would also be trivial -but it's easy to see that any non-zero tangent vector in $T_e PGL(V)$ acts
  non-trivially on $\mathbb{P}V_{\epsilon]/\epsilon^2}$ .
  So we've obtained a non-zero element $v \in H^0(X, T_X)$ . But $T_X = \omega_X^{\vee}=\mathcal{Hom}(\omega_X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ has negative degree by the assumption on the genus, so $H^0(X; T_X) = 0$ ; this is the desired contradiction. recall: $deg(\omega_X)=2g-2$ , therefore $deg(T_X)=2-2g <0$ . Q: why we can assume $k=\bar{k}$ ? why the action of $\text{Aut}(X)$ can be extended to action on $\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})$ via 'pullback
of differentials'? I not understand what this 'pullbak of differentials' has to do with extension of the group action. what is the action of the closure $G$ on $X$ concretly? how acts elements of $G \backslash \kappa(Aut(X))$ on $X$ ? For question (2) I think that that by differentials Litt refers to sections of sheaf $\omega_{\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})}$ and $\iota$ induces maps of $s \in H^0(\omega_{\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n}})$ to pullbacks $\iota^*s \in H^0(\omega_X)$ in functorial sense. what has this to do with extension of the action of $\text{Aut}(X)$ to $\mathbb{P}\Gamma(X,\omega_X ^{\otimes n})$ ?","['automorphism-group', 'proof-explanation', 'algebraic-geometry', 'curves']"

A_{i\parallel k} = A_{i\mid k} - \Gamma^{p}_{ik} A_{p}

A_{i \parallel k} = g_{ip} A^{p}_{\parallel k} \qquad A^{i}_{\parallel k} = g^{ip} A_{p\parallel k}

3385939,Constructing a function based on a real-world scenario,"A random thought came into my head today when I was in the subway: Suppose we have a train in a subway where the stations are evenly spaced in a straight line.  The train accelerates for some amount of time, moves with a constant speed for some amount of time, and starts decelerating until it reaches the next station such that the same amount of time spent accelerating and decelerating are the same, and the magnitudes of both are the same.  Create a possible function that illustrates this scenario. I decided that I would try to use some combination of a sinusoidal function and a linear function, since the train would try to do the same thing during certain periods of time, and the train is moving only in one direction.  I hopped onto Desmos and played around a little bit, and I was able to create a function that gets me somewhat close to what I want. $$d_1(t)=t-\frac1{2\pi}\sin 2\pi t$$ I chose the constant multiple $\frac1{2\pi}$ to simplify the distance between each station to $1$ , and the multiplier $2\pi$ for $t$ to suggest that it takes $1$ unit of time to get from one station to the next.  Choosing the sinusoidal function means that there will be no length of time where the train is moving at a constant speed, and the acceleration and deceleration will be exactly opposite, separated by the point of inflection halfway between the stations. The problem:  trains usually stop at every station.  I want to, arbitrarily at first, modify the function so that the train waits for the same amount of time as it takes to travel from one station to another.  Eventually, I want to be able to construct a function that can describe the waiting time in some proportion to the traveling time.  I came up with the function $$d_2(t)=\begin{cases}t-\frac{\lfloor t\rfloor}2-\frac1{2\pi}\sin 2\pi t,& \lfloor t\rfloor \textrm{ is even}\\ \frac{\lceil t\rceil}2,& \lfloor t\rfloor \textrm{ is odd}
\end{cases}$$ This gets me something closer to what I want. My questions: What alternative ways of representing the scenario are there?  For example, would it be possible to construct a piecewise function based only on polynomials that meets the criteria above? Is there a way to represent this particular scenario without use of a piecewise function? Suppose there must be a stretch of time where the train is moving at a constant speed between stations.  How can I factor that in to the equation for the function? Suppose the train makes the return trip in a similar manner, and it makes some number of return trips daily.  Does this suggest that it can be written as a periodic function?  If so, what would be the equation for that function?","['periodic-functions', 'calculus', 'soft-question', 'recreational-mathematics']"

Then there is an element $x_0 \in A$ such that $x_0 \notin B$ . Suppose $x \in B$ . Clearly $\{x, x_0 \} \in \mathcal{P}(A \cup B)$ so $\{x, x_0 \} \in  \mathcal{P} (A) \cup \mathcal{P} (B)$ . This means $\{x, x_0 \} \subseteq A$ or $\{x, x_0 \} \subseteq B$ . Since $x_0 \notin B$ , $\{x, x_0 \} \nsubseteq B$ . So $\{x, x_0 \} \subseteq A$ , which means $x \in A$ .

Let us assume that $m \le n$ . Then the above equation forces $n>0$ . Then we can take $p=(m^2 + n^2 - mq - 1)/n$ . Then, these matrices are self-adjoint and commuting, so simultaneously diagonalizable. Thus, there is an invertible matrix $P$ and (real) eigenvalues $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i$ (the roots of $\chi_i$ ) such that: $$P^{-1}M_iP= \left(\begin{matrix} \alpha_i&0&0\\0&\beta_i&0\\0&0&\gamma_i \end{matrix} \right)$$ By positivity $\max(\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i) = \Vert M_i \Vert$ . Let us assume that $\Vert M_i \Vert = \gamma_i$ . We can also assume (up to permutation) that $\alpha_1 = min(\alpha_1, \beta_1, \alpha_2, \beta_2)$ . Question : For which $(m,n,q)$ we have $\frac{\alpha_1^3}{\gamma_1} + \frac{\alpha_2^3}{\gamma_2} + 1 <0$ ? Investigation I used SageMath to make some computation when $q=0$ , and it seems that if $m < n$ then the expected property holds. Just with $(m,n,q) = (1,n,0)$ , SageMath provides complicated formula for $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i$ : $\alpha_1 = -\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(3n^2 + 4)\zeta u^{-1/3} - \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}u^{1/3} \overline{\zeta}  + 1/3$ $\beta_1 = -\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(3n^2 + 4) \overline{\zeta} u^{-1/3} - \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}u^{1/3}\zeta  + 1/3$ $\gamma_1 = \frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(3n^2 + 4)u^{-1/3} + \frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}u^{1/3} + 1/3$ $\alpha_2= -\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(n^2 + 6) \overline{\zeta} v^{-1/3} - \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}v^{1/3}\zeta  + \frac{2}{3}n$ $\beta_2= -\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(n^2 + 6)\zeta v^{-1/3} - \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}v^{1/3} \overline{\zeta}  + \frac{2}{3}n$ $\gamma_2= \frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{2/3}(n^2 + 6)v^{-1/3} + \frac{2}{3}n + \frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{1/3}v^{1/3}$ with $\zeta = (i\sqrt{3} + 1)$ , $u = 9n^2 + 9in(\frac{4}{3}n^4 + \frac{13}{3}n^2 + \frac{32}{3})^{1/2} - 16$ and $v = 16n^3 - 18(n^2 - 2)n - 27n + 9i(\frac{4}{3}n^4 + \frac{13}{3}n^2 + \frac{32}{3})^{1/2}$ .

I know how to explicitly write an isomorphism between them but I want to do it using the universal properties to understand better how they work. Here's what I've done: Let $M=\bigoplus_i M_i$ with the canonical injections $\iota_i:M_i\to M$ . Also let $\Phi:M\to S^{-1}M$ be the canonical morphism associated with the localization. Composing these morphisms we get $$\Phi\circ\iota_i:M_i\to S^{-1}M.$$ By the universal property of the localization, we obtain a unique morphism $$\overline{\Phi\circ\iota_i}:S^{-1}M_i\to S^{-1}M$$ such that $\overline{\Phi\circ\iota_i}\circ\Phi_i=\Phi\circ\iota_i$ , where $\Phi_i:M_i\to S^{-1}M_i$ is the localization morphism. Finally, by the universal property of the coproduct we obtain a morphism $$\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i\to S^{-1}M.$$ I think this morphism might be the desired isomorphism but I don't know how to prove it. (Maybe a good idea would be to find its inverse but for it I need some kind of morphism $M\to M_i$ , which is not available when the direct sum is infinite.)

My attempt: I have derived at this by continously using the formula $$\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1-\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{\sin^2(x)}{4}}}$$ Which holds true, since $$

$$ And this holds true with $-$ , since: $$
\begin{align}
\sin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) &\stackrel{?}{=} \frac{1-\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}}{2} \\

$$ Yes, since $$
\sin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 1

3387298,Classify the states of a random walk with reflection at state zero,"Consider the following Markov chain, which is as a random walk with reflection at state zero. Classify the states of the chain (positive/null recurrent or transient). Solution: if $p<\frac{1}{2}$ , all the states are positive recurrent; if $p=\frac{1}{2}$ , all states are null recurrent, and in the case $p>\frac{1}{2}$ we have that every state is transient. As the chain is irreducible all the states will be of the same type. Studying the state $0$ seems to be the best option. I tried proving if $\sum_{n\geq1}p_{00}(n)=\infty$ to see if $0$ is recurrent. $\sum_{n\geq1}p_{00}(2n)=\sum_{n\geq1}{2n\choose n}p^nq^n$$\sim \sum_{n\geq1}\frac{(4pq)^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$ (by Stirling), which diverges iff $p=\frac{1}{2}$ , but for $p<\frac{1}{2}$ the states are also recurrent... To prove positive/null recurrence we know that a recurrent state is null-recurrent iff $p_{ii}(n)\to0$ as $n\to\infty$ , but $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(4pq)^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}=0$ , and we already now that for $p<\frac{1}{2}$ this should not happen. EDIT 1 While proving $\sum_{n\geq1}p_{00}(n)=\infty$ I was assuming that $p_{00}(2n+1)=0$ , which is clearly wrong as we can go from $0$ to $0$ in an odd number of steps thanks to $p_{00}(1)=q$ . Now I'm trying to calculate these $p_{00}(n)$ but I don't succeed. EDIT 2 - New attempt Let $T_i$ be the return time of a certain state (i.e. first time we hit $i$ since we leave it). Then the state $i$ is transient if $Pr(T_i<\infty)=1$ and recurrent if $Pr(T_i<\infty)<1$ . In this case we have that $Pr(T_i=2n+1)=0$ for $n\geq1$ , $Pr(T_i=1)=q,\ Pr(T_i=2n+2)=pq\cdot C_{2n}\cdot(pq)^n\sim$$\sim\frac{pq}{\sqrt\pi}\frac{(4pq)^n}{(n+1)\sqrt n}$ (by Stirling), as we first must go from $0$ to $1$ (and the last step from $1$ to $0$ ) and then in $1$ we can go right a number of steps always $\geq$ than the ones we go left. Then, $Pr(T_i<\infty)=Pr(T_i=1)+\sum_{n\geq0}Pr(T_i=2n+2)=q+pq+\frac{pq}{\sqrt\pi}\sum_{n\geq1}\frac{(4pq)^n}{(n+1)\sqrt n}$ , but I don't know how to compute this sum.","['random-walk', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

3387380,Bijection and Uncountable Sets (understanding),"I'm trying to understand different sizes of infinities and what everything means (trying to piece everything together). So if we find a bijection between a set $A$ and another set $B$ where $B$ is countable (countably infinite), then that implies $A$ is countable (is that correct). Moreover, we can find a bijection between any two countable sets (I think this is correct). If we find a bijection between two finite sets, then the two sets must be of the same cardinality. A proper subset of a finite set, A has smaller cardinality than the set $A$ . However, every infinite subset of a countable set is countable. For example, $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable. I get confused, however, when dealing with uncountable sets.
Is it true that I can find always bijection between uncountable sets? For example, is it always possible to construct a bijection between two uncountable sets. Are there examples of cases where you can construct a bijection between two uncountable sets and cases where you cannot? For example, is there a bijection between $[0,1]$ and $\mathbb{R}$ ? (Can't think of one). In general how do I prove a set is uncountable? I know that if it contains a set that is uncountable then it must be uncountable. Also, I have read through some diagonalization arguments although I find them a bit confusing. Is diagonalization the only way to prove uncountability? Or are there any other ways? What are examples of uncountable sets: $\mathbb{R}$ , the set of binary sequences (I think, not sure), intervals such $[0,1]$ , any other standard ones? (I want to practice proving sets are uncountable, so any suggestions on examples where I can prove a set is uncountable are much appreciated).If we find a bijection, between a set A and an uncountable set (given) does that mean A is uncountable as well? Also to show two sets that are at most countable (either finite or countable) do not have the same cardinality do I show that it is impossible to construct a bijection between them.

Then we can write for any two characteristic functions (which we'd assume that are the limit of continuous functions) $\Lambda (\mathcal{X}_U).\Lambda (\mathcal{X}_V) = 0 $ so at most one of them can be positive. Also we have that $\Lambda (\mathcal{X}_U) =  \int_X \mathcal{X}_U d\nu =\int_U d\nu = \nu(U)$ so $\nu(U).\nu(V) =0 $ which implies that at most one of them can be positive. $\textit{Step 4} :$","['ring-homomorphism', 'measure-theory', 'ring-theory', 'real-analysis']"

If $\forall \epsilon>0$ , $\exists x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n\in A, A=\bigcup_{k=1}^n B(x_k,\epsilon)$ (i.e. totally bounded), then all sequences in $A$ has a Cauchy subsequence. Proof. Let $(x_n)\subseteq A$ be a sequence. Let $F_k$ be a finite $(1/k)$ -net of $A$ . Define the sequences of positive integers $n_{r,s}$ as follows: $(x_{n_{1,s}})_{s=1}^\infty$ is the part of $(x_n)$ that lies in $B(p_1,1)$ , where $p_1\in F_1$ .

Now, let $n_k=n_{k,k}$ . Then $(x_{n_k})$ is a Cauchy subsequence. Are there any other interesting examples of ""diagonal"" proof in mathematics? From the three examples above, it appears that diagonal arguments help us repeat a process infinitely many times.

So, I found the diagonal of the square, $10 \sqrt 2$ , and I reasoned that this is the distance from one end of the quarter circle to the other. I realized this formed a $45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ$ triangle when placed inside of a circle, and two circles' radii compose the legs of the triangle and $10 \sqrt 2$ is the length of the hypotenuse. Thus, the radius of each circle had to be $10.$ Thus, the area of each circle (as a whole) would be given by $\pi 10^2 = 100\pi$ , and dividing by $4$ gave the area of each quarter circle to be $25\pi$ (totalling to $50 \pi$ for both).

3387711,Relation of Determinant and trace of a matrix concerning derivative,"If there is a function $F(t) = det(I_{n} + tA)$ where $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, $t$ is an arbitrary real number, and $I_{n}$ is $n \times n$ identity matrix, is it true that the derivative of $F(t)$ at $t = 0$ is equal to the trace of $A$ ? That is, $F'(0) = Tr(A)$ I currently know that the trace is the sum of the diagonal entries of a matrix but I am not sure how I should go about differentiating the right hand side. Is there a general formula for finding determinant that I could possibly differentiate? It seems like there is something called 'big formula for determinant' but I am not sure how that can be used for this problem. Any help would be appreciated.","['derivatives', 'trace', 'determinant', 'linear-algebra']"
3387768,Fat Cantor Set with large complement???,"I'm encontering fat Cantor sets for the first time, and I found the formula for the length of the complement on Wikipedia (you know, like you do) as $\mu(I \setminus C_\alpha) = \alpha \sum_{n=1}^\infty (2\alpha)^n = \frac{\alpha}{1-2\alpha}$ . This makes sense and is a pretty intuitive extension of the normal Cantor set formula, but also it seems like I can make it arbitrarily large for an $\alpha$ arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{2}$ , which doesn't make much sense for a subset of $[0,1]$ . That said, given the construction of the set, I'm not sure why I'm not allowed to take intervals of length $3^{-n} < \alpha^n < 2^{-n}$ and still use this formula to compute the length of the complement. I feel like I'm missing someting small and silly, so if anyone can set me right on this, I'd appreciate it.","['measure-theory', 'cantor-set', 'real-analysis']"
3387785,What is the epistemological status of the usual proof(s) of Pythagoras' theorem?,"Pythagoras' theorem has a variety of geometric proofs, such as: I want to teach at least one of these proofs to my high school students, because it shows that the formula $\|(x,y)\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ doesn't just come out of nowhere. However I'm a bit confused about what these ""proofs"" are actually achieving. From a higher mathematics perspective, Pythagoras' theorem isn't a theorem, it's a definition. We define the distance between two points in $\mathcal{l}^2(\{e_1,e_2\})$ a certain way, because that's how the space $l^p(X)$ is defined. Or, alternatively, we can think of $l^2(X)$ as an inner product space, and recover the metric by defining $$\|x\| = \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle}.$$ In either case, these kinds of geometric proofs play no role, and the distance between two points is either by definition, or is recovered almost immediately from the definitions. In light of this, I'm not sure what these geometric arguments are really telling us. I think what's going on is that if we assume $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a measure space and a metric space in a compatible way, then these geometric proofs show us that the metric structure has to be a very specific structure. However, I don't understand the details . So, my question is: Question. What is the epistemological status of the usual proof(s) of Pythagoras' theorem?","['measure-theory', 'circles', 'geometry', 'metric-spaces', 'triangles']"
3387795,Integral of square of the Brownian Motion with respect to time,"Is there anything known about the distribution of: $$ \int_0^1 B_t^2 \; dt \; ?$$ I know that without squaring, the distribution of the above variable is normal with mean $0$ and variance $\frac{1}{3}$ ( https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/29504/integral-of-brownian-motion-w-r-t-time ). But if underlying process is nonnegative, the distribution obviously cannot be normal and from simulation I can only conclude that it has mean $\frac{1}{2}$ (which is actually easy to prove) and variance $\frac{1}{3}$ . But the exact distribution is unknown to me. Is there any source of information about such integral?","['stochastic-integrals', 'probability', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'stochastic-calculus']"
