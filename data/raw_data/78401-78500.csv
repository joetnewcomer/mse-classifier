1002676,Question about domain of a function,"My question is from Apostol's Vol. 1 One-variable calculus with introduction to linear algebra textbook. Page 56. Exercise 6. Let $f$ be defined as follows: $f(x)=1$ for $0\le x\le1$ ; $f(x)=2$ for $1\lt x\le2$ . The function is not defined if $x\lt0$ or if $x>2$ . $a)$ Draw the graph of $f$ . $b)$ Let $g(x)=f(2x).$ Describe the domain of $g$ and draw its graph. $c)$ Let $h(x)=f(x-2).$ Describe the domain of $h$ and draw its graph. $d)$ Let $k(x)=f(2x)+f(x-2).$ Describe the domain of k and draw its graph. The attempt at a solution: I drew graph of $f$ , it would look like this (Except function is not defined when $x < 0$ or $x > 2$ ): As for $b)$ and $c)$ , since $g(x)=f(2x)$ , on interval $0\le x\le1$ , $g(x)=2$ as I understand, and on interval $1\lt x\le2$ , $g(x)=4$ , but since function $f$ is defined from $x=0$ to $x=2$ , wouldn't same be true for $g(x)$ ? Wouldn't same be true for $c)$ ? What am I missing? because answer says that domain of function of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ is different from domain of $f$ , and domain of $k(x)=f(2x)+f(x-2)$ is empty.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
1002695,Does a sequence of moments determine the function?,"Related questions and answers: Find a smooth function with prescribed moments When do equations represent the same curve? Consider a real valued integrable function $f(x)$ at the interval $a \le x \le b$ ; $x,a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ ; $ b > a$ . The moments of such a function are defined by:
$$
M_0 = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \\
M_1 = \int_a^b x \, f(x)\,dx \\
M_2 = \int_a^b x^2 \, f(x)\,dx \\
\cdots \\
M_k = \int_a^b x^k \, f(x)\,dx \\
\cdots
$$
Note that the function $f$ is not said to be positive. Also note that the moments $M$ form an infinite sequence. Now the gist of the question is: can this problem be reversed? That is, given the infinite sequence $M_k$ , can $f(x)$ be solved - and how? - from:
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = M_0\\
\int_a^b x \, f(x)\,dx = M_1\\
\int_a^b x^2 \, f(x)\,dx = M_2\\
\cdots \\
\int_a^b x^k \, f(x)\,dx = M_k\\
\cdots
$$ Theorem. Without loss of generality, the domain of the function $f(x)$ may be restricted to $0 \le x \le 1$ and the range of the moments may be restricted to $0 \le M_k \le 1$ . The primary purpose of this Theorem is to make numerical experiments easier to accomplish. Proof. Let $t=(x-a)/(b-a)$ or $x=(b-a)t+a$ with $0 \le t \le 1$ and $g(t) = f((b-a)t+a)$ or $f(x) = g((x-a)/(b-a))$ . The moments $m_k$ of $g(t)$ are calculated by:
$$
m_k = \int_0^1 t^k \, g(t) \, dt
$$
It follows (with Newton's binomial) that:
$$
M_k = \int_a^b x^k \, f(x)\,dx = \int_0^1 \left[(b-a)t+a\right]^k g(t) (b-a) \, dt =
\sum_{i=0}^k \binom{k}{i} (b-a)^{i+1} a^{k-i} m_i
$$
Or, the other way around:
$$
m_k = \int_0^1 t^k \, g(t) \, dt = \int_a^b \left[\frac{x-a}{b-a}\right]^k f(x)/(b-a) \, dx =
\frac{1}{(b-a)^{k+1}}\sum_{i=0}^k \binom{k}{i}(-a)^{k-i} M_i
$$
Herewith the $f(x)$-moments $M_k$ can be converted into $g(t)$-moments $m_k$ and vice versa. Then maybe we can solve for a function $g(t)$ . But anyway we can do the backward transformation
$f(x) = g((x-a)/(b-a))$ . This proves the first part of the Theorem. The moments $\mu_k$ of a function $h(t) = \lambda\, g(t) + C$ are calculated by:
$$
\mu_k = \int_0^1 t^k \, h(t) \, dt = \lambda\, m_k + C/(k+1)
$$ 
Suppose the smallest moment $\mu_k$ is found for $k=p$ and the largest moment is found for $k=q$ ,
then we can adapt the constants $\lambda$ and $C$ in such a way that all moments $\mu_k$ are
between $0$ and $1$ :
$$
\mu_p = \lambda\, m_p + C/(p+1) = 0 \quad ; \quad \mu_q = \lambda\, m_q + C/(q+1) = 1 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \\
\lambda = \frac{q+1}{m_q(q+1) - m_p(p+1)} \quad ; \quad C = - \frac{m_p(p+1)(q+1)}{m_q(q+1) - m_p(p+1)}
$$
This proves the second part of the Theorem. But how to proceed with the (re)main(ing) part of the question: given $0 \le M_k \le 1$ , then - if possible - solve $f$ from
$$
\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx = M_0\\
\int_0^1 x \, f(x)\,dx = M_1\\
\int_0^1 x^2 \, f(x)\,dx = M_2\\
\cdots \\
\int_0^1 x^k \, f(x)\,dx = M_k\\
\cdots

1002930,Strange Consequences of Large Cardinals in Probability,"Large cardinal axioms are very strong hypothesizes and as any other strong hypothesis they have many strange consequences in mathematics. On the other hand we know that if we bring even the least infinity ($\aleph_0$) into the story, there will be many strange theorems in probability which are challenging to our intuition. (Recall the well-known example of a monkey who is typing randomly and can type entire masterworks of human literature if he has an infinite time). I wonder what would happen if we work with large cardinalities rather than $\aleph_0$ in probability? In fact there are some connections between large cardinals and probability. Probably the most well known is the problem of extending Lebesgue measure to all sets of reals which is equivalent to the existence of a real valued measurable cardinal $\leq 2^{\aleph0}$. Note that a real valued measurable cardinal $\kappa$ by definition is an uncountable cardinal in which there is a $\kappa$-additive probability measure on the power set of $\kappa$ which vanishes on singletons. Question: What are examples of theorems in probability theory which are related to large cardinals or have a large cardinal strength? Is there any example of a philosophically strange probabilistic phenomena which happens in the real world if we assume existence of large cardinals? I mean something like the example of a monkey who can type all texts of human literature if we assume existence of $\aleph_0$ as the weakest large cardinal assumption.","['large-cardinals', 'set-theory', 'philosophy', 'reference-request', 'probability']"

1003133,Motivation for the Definition of Compact Sets,"I'm currently taking my first course in real analysis, and was recently introduced to the following definition of compact sets: A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if every open cover of $S$ contains a finite subcover. Shortly after learning the above definition of compact sets, I learned the Heine-Borel Theorem, which states that a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if $S$ is closed and bounded. Therefore, the Heine-Borel theorem presents us with an equivalent way to think of compactness. To me, it seems much simpler to define compactness in terms of closed and bounded sets instead of open covers and finite subcovers. My question is, why are compact sets defined using open covers and finite subcovers? Why were compact sets not originally defined to be subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that are closed and bounded? So far in my study of analysis, introducing open covers and finite subcovers seems to be needlessly complicating things. I've searched around the internet for answers, but most sources that I've come across discuss subjects from topology which are beyond what I've studied in analysis. Any answers that can be presented in the context of a third-year introductory course to real analysis will be much appreciated. Thank you!","['compactness', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

When $p=1$, Nesbitt's inequality shows that the minimum is $3/2$, achieved when $a=b=c$. When $p=1/2$, this question shows that the minimum arbitrarily approches $2$, achieved when $a=1$ and $b=c\rightarrow\infty$. Note that the minimum is not achieved when $a=b=c$. So it seems there is a regime of values of $p$ where the minimum is achieved when $a=b=c$, and at some point it transitions to the regime where the minimum is achieved when $a=1$ and $b=c\rightarrow\infty$?

1003666,Folland's ''Real Analysis'' Exercise 3.17: Missing hypothesis?,"The following exercise is 3.17 in Folland's Real Analysis, Second Edition: ''Let $(X, \scr{M}, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, $\scr{N}$ a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\scr{M}$, and $\nu = \mu|\scr{N}$.  If $f \in L^1(\mu)$, there exists $g \in L^1(\nu)$ (thus $g$ is $\scr{N}$-measurable) such that $\int_E f d\mu = \int_E g d\nu$ for all $E \in \scr{N}$; if $g'$ is another such function then $g = g'$ $\nu$-a.e.  (In probability theory, $g$ is called the conditional expectation of $f$ on $\scr{N}$.)'' My question is this :  Is Folland missing a hypothesis that $\nu$ is $\sigma$-finite?  This is not necessarily true even if $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite.  For example, if $\mu(X) = \infty$ and $\scr{N} = \{X, \emptyset\}$, then $\nu$ is not $\sigma$-finite. The obvious way to go about solving this exercise is to define a measure $\lambda$ on $(X, \scr{N})$ by $\lambda(E) = \int_E f d\mu$.  Then $\lambda <\!\!< \nu$.  So if $\nu$ is assumed to be $\sigma$-finite , one may apply the Radon-Nikodym theorem in the form of Exercise 3.14, which I quote here, to obtain the desired result (using Exercise 3.14 eliminates the need to worry about whether $\lambda$ is $\sigma$-finite): ''If $\nu$ is an arbitrary signed measure and $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure on $(X, \scr{M})$ such that $\nu <\!\!< \mu$, there exists an extended $\mu$-integrable function $f \colon X \to [-\infty, \infty]$ such that $d\nu = f d\mu$.'' Of course, in my proof of Exercise 3.17, I am making the replacements $\nu \to \lambda$, $\mu \to \nu$, and $\scr{M} \to \scr{N}$ in the statement of Exercise 3.14.

1003798,The variance of Lincoln-Peterson estimator,"Capture-recapture is a method commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size. Let $N$ = Number of animals in the population; $K$ = Number of animals marked on the first visit; $n$ = Number of animals captured on the second visit; $k$ = Number of recaptured animals that were marked. It is assumed that all individuals have the same probability of being captured in the second sample, regardless of whether they were previously captured in the first sample. 
This implies that, in the second sample, the proportion of marked individuals that are caught ($k/K$) should equal the proportion of the total population that is caught ($n/N$). 
In symbols, $\frac{k}{K} = \frac{n}{N}$. This derives the Lincoln–Petersen estimator$$\hat{N}_{LP}=\frac{Kn}{k}$$

((A - B) \cap C \cap B \cap D) = A \cap C - B \cap C - A \cap D$ where it uses the facts: $(A - B)\times C = A\times C - B\times C$ $A-(B-C) = (A-B)\cup(A\cap C)$ Is the statement/my proof correct?

1004195,Applications of the Closed graph theorem,"In functional analysis a famous theorem states that: if $X, Y$ are Banach spaces and $T: X \to Y$ is a linear operator, $T$ is continous if and only if the graph $\Gamma_T:={(x,Tx), x \in X}$ is closed in the product topology. Do you know some nice application of this theorem? Thank you!!",['functional-analysis']
1004196,Two independent Poisson processes.,"I am trying to prove the result that exactly $k$ occurrences of a Poisson process before the first occurrence of another independent Poisson process is a geometric random variable. \begin{align}
& P(k\text{ events of type }\lambda_1 \text{before first event of type } \lambda_2) P(\text{the next event is of type }\lambda_2) \\[6pt]
= {} &\left( \int_0^\infty e^{-\lambda_1t}\frac{(\lambda_1t)^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda_2t}dt\right) (\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2}) \\[6pt]
= {} & \frac{\lambda_1^{k}\lambda_2}{k!(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)} \int_0^\infty t^ke^{-(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)t} \, dt \\[6pt]
= {} & \frac{\lambda_1^{k}\lambda_2}{k!(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)} . \frac{\Gamma(k+1)}{(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)^{k+1}} \\[6pt]
= {} & \frac{\lambda_1^{k}\lambda_2}{(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)^{k+2}}
\end{align} I cannot figure out why I am having an extra $(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)$ term in the denominator. Can someone please point out where I am going wrong? Thanks!","['statistics', 'stochastic-processes', 'poisson-distribution', 'probability-distributions']"
1004219,Solving equations with mod,"So, I'm trying to solve the following equation using regular algebra, and I don't think I'm doing it right: $3x+5 = 1\pmod {11}$ I know the result is $x = 6$ , but when I do regular algebra like the following, I do not get 6: $3x=1  - 5\pmod{11}$ $x = \dfrac{(1 \pmod{11} - 5)} 3$ So, I figured that since $1 \pmod{11} = 1$ the equation becomes $x = \dfrac{-4} 3$ Which is not 6! I am totally lost here and would appreciate any help......","['modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1004229,A problem similar to Maschke's theorem,"My question is about a problem that its assumptions are like Maschke's theorem in some ways. Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field that $char \mathbb{F}$ doesn't divide $|G:H|<\infty$ and $M$ be an $\mathbb{F}G$-module that is completely reducible $\mathbb{F}H$-module. We want to show that $M$ is completely reducible $\mathbb{F}G$-module I know that the group $G$ in this problem must be infinite and with this assumption, it is far from Maschke's theorem, but with the asumption of $|G:H|<\infty$, I think that the proof can be like that of Maschke's theorem but I don't know how. I will be so appreciate if someone give me some hints or prove this statement here.","['representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
