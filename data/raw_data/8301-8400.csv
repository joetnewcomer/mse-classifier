62967,Samples and random variables,"Suppose I picked a sample of $n$ 20-year-olds. I measured the height of each to obtain $n$ numbers: $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$. According to theory of probability/statistics, there are $n$ random variables associated with the sample, say $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$. However, I do not understand the relationship between the $X_i$ and the $h_i$, I have yet to see it explained clearly in any book and so I have a few questions. What is the probability space corresponding to the $X_i$? It seems to me that the way one samples should effect what the probability space will look like. In this case, I am sampling without replacement and the order in which I picked the individuals is irrelevant so I believe the sample space $\Omega$ should consist of all $n$-tuples of 20-year-olds such that no two tuples contain the same individuals. In this way, $X_i(\omega)$ is the height of the $i$th individual in the $n$-tuple $\omega \in \Omega$. The sample I picked would therefore correspond to one particlar point in $\Omega$, call it $\omega_0$, such that $X_i(\omega_0) = h_i$. I surmise that the $\sigma$-algebra will be just the power set $2^\Omega$ of $\Omega$ but I haven't a clue as to what the probability measure would be. Let $(\Gamma, 2^\Gamma, P)$ be a probability space where $\Gamma$ is the set of all 20-year-olds and let $X$ be a random variable on $\Gamma$ such that $X(\gamma)$ is the height of the individual $\gamma\in\Gamma$. What is the connection between the $X_i$ and $X$ besides that afforded to us by the law of large numbers? In particular, what is the exact relationship between the probability space of $X$ and that of the $X_i$?","['statistics', 'probability']"
62968,Cones of positive semidefinite matrices generated by matrices of rank $1$,"Let $S_n$ be the space of real $n \times n$ symmetric matrices and let $S_n^+$ be the convex cone of positive semidefinite matrices in $S_n$. The extremal rays of this cone correspond to the positive semidefinite matrices of rank $1$. My problem is that I have a subcone $C$ of $S_n^+$ which is given by (finitely many) inequalities, which are not all linear (quadratic for example). In $C$ I have another subcone $C'$ given by generators which correspond to rank $1$ matrices. Since I would like to compare $C$ and $C'$, it would be nice to have inequalities defining $C'$. So my question is if there are known methods to determine such inequalities.","['matrices', 'convex-analysis', 'multilinear-algebra', 'rank-1-matrices']"

62982,Ratio + Quantity,"I am trying to create a metric which would tell us how good or bad a client is. Right now I am using a simple ratio: 
$$
\frac{\text{number of bills paid on time}}{\text{number of bills}}.
$$ This give me a percentage and it essentially tell us if a client always pays it bill on time ($0$ = never, $1$ = always). For instance, a client who paid only one bill on time is as good as a client who paid 20 bills on time with this metric. The problem with this metric is that it doesn’t capture the number of bills the consumer had to pay. Does anybody has an idea on how I could capture these two information (paid on time + number of bills) into one single number?",['algebra-precalculus']
62988,A rigorous proof of an obvious fact about a Markov chain,"So I'm having trouble writing down a rigorous proof of something that seems very clear. Consider the following Markov chain on a ring: with probability $1/2$, it stays where it is, with probability $1/2-1/n$ it moves counterclockwise, and with probability $1/n$ it jumps to a random node. When the latter has happened, we'll say a jump has occurred. Let $A$ be the event that by time $10n$, exactly one jump has occurred. 
Let $B$ be the event that the random walk has never taken the self loop at node $1$. I want to prove that $P(B|A)$ is lower bounded by some constant independent of $n$. I'm actually guessing that $P(B|A) \geq 1/2^{11}$. This seems obvious to me: conditional on $A$, the number of times the chain transitions into node $1$  by time $10n$ is at most $11$, and the probability of not taking the self-loop is $1/2$ each time. But how to say this formally? Edit: Actually the above sketch is somewhat problematic: as Craig points out in the comments, taking exactly one jump changes the probabilities of taking the self loop whenever the chain is at node $1$. But, presumably, the chance of taking the counterclockwise transition should only increase, since the number of jumps is below what you'd expect in $10n$ transitions. So I'd be perfectly satisfied with the bound $(1/2-1/n)^{11}$ instead.","['markov-chains', 'probability']"

62997,Decomposability and irreducibility for representations,"I am trying to understand the analogies between linear representations
and permutation representations: A representation $\rho:G \to GL(V)$ is irreducible if it has
no invariant subspace apart from the trivial ones.
It is indecomposable if we cannot write the representation
as a direct sum of invariant subspaces. I was reading the article ""Representations of Finite Groups as Permutation Groups""
by Aschbacher. There he claims that the indecomposable representations
- i.e. now in the context of permutation groups - are exactly the transitive groups.
I think I understand this since we can decompose an intransitive representation into
its transitive constituents.
However, he goes on writing that the indecomposable irreducible ones are 
the transitive primitive groups. I want to understand how this reflects the properties of irreducible linear representations.
I would already call a transitive representation irreducible since there cannot be any subsets
that are fixed because of transitivity. Of course primitivity means that no blocks are fixed. But why is this the right analogue 
for irreducibility? In fact I might ask a more general question, which might also answer the previous one. On wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation#Representations_in_other_categories it is mentioned that permutation representations and linear representation can be regarded as
a special case of representations into a fixed category.

63020,Eigenvalues of some peculiar matrices,"While I was toying around with matrices, I chanced upon a family of tridiagonal matrices $M_n$ that take the following form: the superdiagonal entries are all $1$'s, the diagonal entries take the form $m_{j,j}=4 j (2 n + 3) - 8 j^2 - 6 n - 5$, and the subdiagonal entries take the form $m_{j+1,j}=4 j (2 j - 1) (2 n - 2 j + 1) (n - j)$.

63030,Open sets do not have measure zero,"I want to show that if $a\lt b$, then $(a,b)$ is not of measure zero. My idea was to show that any interval covering $(a,b)$ is such that the sum of the lengths of the intervals is always greater than $b-a$. So I tried induction. Suppose $n=1$, where $n$ is the number of intervals covering $(a,b)$.
Then the interval consists of a single set of the form, say,  $(c,d)$ such that $(a,b)\subset (c,d)$. If this is the case then obviously, we would have $d-c \gt b-a$, where I have assumed that $c\lt a$ and $b \lt d$. Now my questions: I am a little bit lost as to how to show it for $n+1$.

63043,Finding a function's domain from the function's formula,"There is a question in my calculus 101 textbook that says find the domain of the function . The function formulas are given, eg: $$f(x) = \frac{x+4}{x^2 -9}$$
and
$$g(t) = \sqrt[3]{2t - 1}$$ No other information or context is provided. The back of the text says that the answers are 
$$(-\infty, -3)\cup(-3,3)\cup(3,\infty)$$
and
$$(-\infty, \infty)$$ The answer for $g(t)$ makes some sense because, without any specification otherwise, it seems reasonable to me to assume that the domain is infinite. However, I don't understand the meaning of the answer to $f(x)$, nor do I understand how it can depend on the formula of the function. I was under the impression that domains are either defined explicitly and independently of the formula, or are undefined. I thought that the domain is the set of possible inputs to the function, and that therefore the domain is not at all dependent on (or constrained by) the formula.","['calculus', 'functions']"

63115,Variations on the Stirling's formula for $\Gamma(z)$,"I am currently reading some material that makes heavy usage of Hypergeometric functions, and there is one particular point about applying Stirling's approximation to various terms consisting of Gamma-Functions that is not very clear to me. We have the classical Stirling's approximation formula for the Gamma-Function in the form:
$$
  \Gamma(z)=\sqrt{2\pi}e^{-z}z^{z-1/2}\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{|z|}\right)\right)
$$ for $|\arg(z)|<\pi$ as $|z|\to\infty$. In absolute value:
$$
  |\Gamma(z)|=\sqrt{2\pi}e^{-\Re(z)}|z|^{\Re(z)-1/2}e^{-\Im(z)\arg(z)}\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{|z|}\right)\right)
$$ Now, there is also the shifted Stirling's approximation for the Gamma-Function due to C. Rowe, if I am not mistaken, that says:
$$
  \Gamma(z+a)=\sqrt{2\pi}e^{-z}z^{z+a-1/2}\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{|z|}\right)\right)
$$ uniformly for $|\arg(z)|\leq\pi-\varepsilon$, $a$ in a compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and some suitable fixed $\varepsilon>0$, as $|z|\to\infty$. In absolute value:

$$
  \Gamma(az+b)\Gamma(cz+d)
$$
for some complex numbers $a,b,c$ and $d$. (Q1) Using the classical Stirling's approximation formula (i.e. not the shifted one), how can one obtain a meaningful aggregated asymptotics for the above expression? I am asking this because there are several places that apply the non-shifted version of Stirling's formula to shifted Gamma factors without mentioning any details, which leaves the impression that this is a fairly standard or even trivial argument. Unfortunately, at this point I am unable to see its triviality. What bothers me here is the term
$$
  (az+b)^{az+b-1/2}(cz+d)^{cz+d-1/2}

I have intentionally not specified anything about the parameters $a,b,c$ and $d$ because my question rather aims at the principle of applying the non-shifted Stirling's approximation to Gamma terms like the above one. (Q2) Are there any other versions or forms of the Stirling's approximation for $\Gamma(z)$ that could be particularly useful for computing such kinds of asymptotics?

63157,The Dual Pairing,"My understanding from the reading the Wikipedia article on Dual Pairs is that a dual pair is comprised of two vector spaces $X$ and $Y$  over a field $\mathbb{K}$ together with a nondegenerate bilinear mapping $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$. For $V$ a vector space and it (algebraic) dual $V^{*}$, I have  seen this notation used to effectively represent the evaluation of an element $f \in V^{*}$ at a point $v \in V$ to yield an element of $\mathbb{K}$, i.e., $\langle f, v \rangle = f(v)$ But, from reading the Wikipedia definition, there seems to be no requirement that $X$ and $Y$ are themselves ""dual"" spaces. So, if we simply supply an inner product $(\cdot | \cdot)$ for $V$ have we effectively induced a ""dual paring"" between $V$ and itself, i.e., $\langle u, v \rangle = (u | v)$ ? Finally, I have also seen the Lie derivative of a smooth function $f$ on a manifold $M$ with respect to a smooth vector field on $M$ defined by $L_vf = \langle df, v \rangle$. How should the ""dual paring"" in this instance be interpreted? Here, $v$ is in the tangent bundle and $df$ is an element of the cotangent bundle so in this case these spaces truly dual in the algebraic sense.

63178,Associated bundle,"Given a principal $G$-Bundle $P\rightarrow X$ and if we let $G$ act on itself by multiplication (denote this action by $\rho$) we obtain an associated bundle $P\times_{\rho} G=(P\times G)/\sim$ where $(p,f)\sim(gp, gf)$ with fibers homeomorphic to $G$. It is easy to check that this bundle is G-principal; the G-action is given by $g[p,f]=[p,fg]$. If we change the action of $G$ on itself to conjugation (denote this action by $\phi$) we can construct an associated bundle $P \times_{\phi} G$ in the same way. However, I want to show that this is not a principal bundle by showing that the fibers are not only homeomorphic to $G$ but they are groups isomorphic to $G$. (This would imply that the bundle has a section and if it were principal it would be trivial and there are examples of non trivial associated conjugation bundles). How can I show that each fiber of $P \times_{\phi} G$ is a fiber bundle of groups? I would probably have to use the fact that conjugation by a fixed element is a group isomorphism, since in the case of multiplication, which is not a group isomorphism, the obtained bundle is principal.","['fiber-bundles', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

63207,Produce output with certain probability using fair coin flips,"""Introduction to Algorithm"" C.2-6 Describe a procedure that takes as input two integers a and b such that $0 < a < b$

  with probability $(b - a) /b$. Give a bound on the expected number of coin flips,
  which should be O(1) (Hint: Represent a/b in binary.) My guess is that we can use head to represent bit 0 and tail for bit 1. Then by flipping $m = \lceil \log_2 b \rceil$ times, we obtain a $m$ bit binary based number $x$.  If $ x \ge b $, then we just drop x and do the experiment again, until we can an $ x < b$.  This x has probility $P\{ x < a\} = \frac a b$ and $P\{ a \le x < a\} = \frac {b - a} b$ But I'm not quite sure if my solution is what the question asks. Am I right? Edit, I think Michael and TonyK gave the correct algorithm, but Michael explained the reason behind the algorithm. The 3 questions he asked: show that this process requires c coin flips, in expectation, for some constant c; The expectation of c, the number of flips, as TonyK pointed out, is 2. show that you yell ""NO!"" with probability 2/3; P(yell ""NO!"") = P(""the coin comes up tails on an odd toss"") = $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty (\frac 1 2)^ k = \frac 2 3$ explain how you'd generalize to other rational numbers, with the same constant c It's the algorithm given by TonyK. We can restate it like this Represent a/b in binary. Define $f(Head) = 0$, and $f(Tail) = 1$.  If f(nth flip's result) = ""nth bit of a/b"" then terminate.  If the last flip is Head, we yell ""Yes"", otherwise ""No"".

Is the converse true, that for any primes $p\lt q$, if $q\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ then there exists a nonabelian group of order $pq$? One example I found online is that $\mathbb{Z}_3\ltimes \mathbb{Z}_7$ is nonabelian, and here $7\equiv 1\pmod{3}$. I was considering then semidirect products $\mathbb{Z}_p\ltimes\mathbb{Z}_q$ where $q\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ and some homomorphism $\phi\colon \mathbb{Z}_p\to\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_q)$ I calculate that

Making no further assumptions, we have $$ f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h + \frac{f''(x)h^2}{2} + \ldots + \frac{ f^{(n)}(x)h^n}{n!} + o(h^n) $$ although this tells us nothing about the size of the error on any fixed neighbourhood of $x$ (further regularity assumptions are needed to get the traditional forms for the remainder). Wikipedia has a proof of this which relies on, of all things, L'Hôpital's rule for which a proof is provided as well. Recently I've been working through the basic theorems of calculus in the Banach space setting. It's not terribly surprising and I have seen it written in a few places that the expansion $$ f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h + \frac{f''(x)h^2}{2} + \ldots + \frac{ f^{(n)}(x)h^n}{n!} + o(\|h\|^n) $$ is still valid when $f$ is a map of Banach spaces $X \to Y$. In this setting, the $k$th derivative $f^{(k)}(x)$ of $f$ at $x$ is a continuous, symmetric, $k$-linear map $X^k \to Y$ and $h^k$ is short-hand for $(h,\ldots,h) \in X^k$.

I'm having trouble adapting the proof from the single variable case because I can't seem to prove an appropriate analogue of L'Hôpital's rule.

In fact, I think I would also be curious to know: Do Cauchy's mean value theorem or  L'Hôpital's rule have natural generalizations in the context of maps between Banach spaces?

63258,Principal and fiber bundles as defined by Husemoller,"In his book 'Fiber Bundles' Husemoller defines principal bundles and fiber bundles quite differently from how they are usually defined. Specifically: Definition: a right $G$-space $X$ is called effective if $G$ acts freely (or faithfully? It's ambiguous) on $X$ (that is, $xs = x$ implies $s = 1$). Definition: Consider the space $X^* \subset X \times X$ given as $X^* = \{(x, xs) \mid x \in X, s \in G\}$. For all $(x, y) \in X^*$ there is a unique $\tau(x, y) \in G$ such that $x \tau(x, y) = y$. Thus we have the translation function $\tau: X^* \to G$. We call $X$ principal if $\tau$ is continuous. Definition: A bundle $\xi: X \to B$ is called principal if $X$ is a principal $G$-space, and there exists a homeomorphism $f: X/G \to B$ inducing a bundle isomorphism $(1_X, f): \alpha(X) \to \xi$, where $\alpha$ is a functor from right $G$-spaces to bundles given by projection $X \to X/G$. Definition: Consider a principal $G$-bundle $\xi: X \to B$, and let $F$ be a left $G$-space. The formula $(x, y)s = (xs, s^{-1}y)$ gives a structure of a right $G$-space on $X \times F$. Denote $X_F := (X \times F)/G$, and consider $\xi[F]: X_F \to B$ - a factorization of the composition $X \times F \to X \stackrel{\xi}{\to} B$ by the projection $X \times F \to X_F$, or, explicitly, $\xi[F] ((x,y)G) = \xi(x)$. Such a $\xi[F]$ is called the fiber bundle over $B$ with fiber $F$ and the associated principal bundle $\xi$. The group $G$ is called the structure group of the fiber bundle $\xi[F]$. This is totally baffling to me, because the meaning of the terms is wildly different from the meaning in other sources I encountered so far, like Wikipedia; note that neither principal bundle nor fiber bundle is required to be locally trivial here! What are these things called in the mainstream literature? How do they arise, why are they interesting?

  that at least six satellites are always within line of sight from
  almost everywhere on Earth's surface. I understand that we need 4 satellites within line of sight in order to solve for position and time. Let's accept that for fail-safe reasons, we require that 6 satellites are always within line of sight, everywhere on Earth. Here is my question: why do we need to a minimum of 24 satellites in order to have 6 of them within line of sight? Let $r$ be Earth's radius and $R$ be the orbital radius of the satellites, the area of the orbital sphere visible at any place on Earth's surface is $A=\int R^2 \sin\theta\,\mathrm d\theta\,\mathrm d\phi = -2\pi R^2\int_1^{r/R} \mathrm d\cos\theta = 2\pi R^2(1-r/R)$ The fraction of solid angle visible is $x = 2\pi R^2(1-r/R)/(4\pi R^2) = (1-r/R)/2$ Substituting $R =$ 26,600 km and $r = $ 6,370 km (values from Wikipedia), we get $x =$ 38.0%.

63420,Changing coordinates of vector fields,"For tangent vectors at a single point, the transformation law is given by $\tilde{X}^j = \frac{\partial \tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i} (p) X^i$, where $\tilde{X}^j$ are the components in the new coordinates, $X^i$ components of the old coordinates, $\frac{\partial \tilde{x}^j}{\partial x^i}$ is the partial derivative of the transition function, and $p$ is the coordinate representation of the point in the old coordinates. So I figure that to get a vector field in new coordinates, what I do is take a point $\tilde{p}$ in my new coordinates, transform it back using the transition map to get $p$ in old coordinates, and apply the transformation law above. I try to do a concrete example, and find that there is a mistake somewhere. Suppose I have the vector field $x \partial_x + y \partial_y$ in standard coordinates. I want to write this in polar coordinates as $f(\theta, r) \partial_r + g(\theta, r) \partial_\theta$. for some functions $f, g$. Applying the transformation law at some fixed point $(x, y)$, I get that the component of $\partial_r$ is $2x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot x + 2y \cdot \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot y = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and for $\partial_\theta$, I have $-yx^{-2} \frac{1}{1+(y/x)^2} \cdot x + x^{-1} \frac{1}{1 + (y/x)^2} \cdot y = 0$ Thus, at any point $(x, y)$, the tangent vector $x \partial_x + y \partial_y$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \partial_r + 0 \cdot \partial_\theta$. So for any $(r, \theta)$ in polar coordinates, I get $(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$ in standard coordinates, which gives me $r \partial_r$ as my vector field. But this is clearly wrong. For $x \partial_x + y \partial_y$ is the vector field which attaches the vector $(x, y)$ at the point $(x, y)$, while $r \partial_r$ attaches a horizontal vector of length $r$ at each point. Where have I made my mistake? EDIT: I guess the computation is correct. I still feel it is a bit lengthy, is there any quick way to compute a change of coordinates from standard to polar?
