1845193,Is every unramified extension of DVRs simple?,"Let $A$ be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$, fraction field $K$, and $L$ a finite separable extension of $K$ degree $n$, unramified w.r.t. $A$. Let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $L$. Is it true that $B$ has the form $A[x]/(f)$ for some $f\in A[x]$? Here's what I have so far: Certainly $B$ is finite etale over $A$ of degree $n$, and if $\alpha\in B$ is a generator of $L$ over $K$ with monic minimal polynomial $f\in A[x]$, then $A[x]/(f)$ is finite flat over $A$ of degree $n$, so if $A[x]/(f)$ is etale over $A$, then the natural injection $A[x]/(f)\hookrightarrow B$ would have to be etale of rank 1, hence an isomorphism. Thus, it suffices to show that $A[x]/(f)$ is etale over $A$, or equivalently, that the image $\overline{f}$ of $f$ in $(A/\mathfrak{m})[x]$ is a separable polynomial. Another question: is the unramified condition necessary? What's an example of a finite non-simple extension of DVR's?","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
1845205,"I derived a new formula related to arithmetic sequences, I think!","First of all, I am a 12th grader so I don't know how to write research notes. So please forgive me if my writing is not so impressive! I don't know what to do to tell the world about whatever I found. So, may be it's stupid, but I am posting my formula here in Stack Exchange. Recently I was trying to figure out how to find the nth term in a series, or sequence, where the differences ($d$) between the elements of the series are not constant, but if $d$ for each $A_n - A_{(n-1)}$ is written in a sequence, it gives an AP. For example, the sequence: $A = 7, 14, 28, 49, ... n$ is not in AP But taking the differences for all $A_n - A_{(n - 1)}$, where $n > 1$, we get an AP: $$A' = 7, 14, 21... $$ The above AP has a common difference of 7. In order to find $A_n$, We can use the below formula: $$A_n = \left(\frac {n - 1}{2} \{2a' + (n - 2) d' \}\right) + a_1$$ Where, $a_1$ is the first element in the sequence $$a' = a_2 - a_1$$ $$d' = a_3 - (a' + a_2)$$ I can't describe here how I get to that point. Here is the application of the formula in the following sequence: $$A = 7, 14, 28, 49, ... n$$ In sequence, let $n = 3$ and we have to find $A_n$ $$a_1 = 7$$ $$a' = 14 - 7 = 7$$ $$d' = 28 - (14 + 7) = 7$$ By formula: $$A_n = \frac {n - 1}{2} \{2a' + (n - 2) d' \} + a_1$$ $$A_3 = \frac {3 - 1}{2} \{2 \times 7 + (3 - 2) 7 \} + 7$$ $$A_3 = \frac {2}{2} \{14 + 7 \} + 7 = 28$$ Notes: 1) I am still testing it. 2) There are other methods exist to find $A_n$ in these type of sequences, may be they are easier, I don't know. 3) I am not sure if I am the first person to derive this formula, if I am not, then I apologize. Let me know, if someone has found something wrong with this.","['arithmetic-progressions', 'arithmetic', 'sequences-and-series', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1845241,Linear four-parameter recurrence from Concrete Mathematics,"In the book Concrete Mathematics, there's an exercise (1.16) where you're asked to solve a general four-parameter recurrence using the Repertoire Method. The recurrence is defined as follows: \begin{align*}
g(1) &= \alpha;\\
g(2n+j) &= 3g(n)+\gamma n + b_j, \ \ for\ \  j=0,1\ \ and\ \ n\geq 0
\end{align*} We can show that this can be written on the form:
\begin{equation}
g(n) = \alpha A(n)+\beta_0 B(n) + \beta_1 C(n) + \gamma D(n)
\end{equation} In the book the solution involves two steps: 1) let $(\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1, \gamma) = (\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1, 0)$ then 
\begin{equation}
g(n)=g((b_mb_{m-1}\ldots b_0)_2)=(\alpha \beta_{b_{m-1}}\ldots \beta_{b_0})_3
\end{equation}
and therefore
\begin{equation}
\alpha A(n)+\beta_0 B(n) + \beta_1 C(n) + 0D(n) = (\alpha \beta_{b_{m-1}}\ldots \beta_{b_0})_3
\end{equation} 2) let $g(n) = n$ thus finding values of $\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1, \gamma$:
\begin{align}
1&=\alpha\\
2n&=3n+\gamma n + \beta_0\\
2n+1&= 3n+\gamma n + \beta_1
\end{align}
give us $(\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1, \gamma)=(1,0,1,-1)$ and therefore 
\begin{equation}
A(n)+C(n)-D(n) = n
\end{equation} We can therefore write the solution on the form (solving above equation for D(n)):
\begin{equation}
g(n)=(\alpha \beta_{b_{m-1}}\ldots \beta_{b_0})_3 + \gamma(A(n)+C(n)-n)
\end{equation} After the above steps, the solutions says ""hence we know everything"" but I don't see how this is a solution to the recurrence as we don't know C(n) nor B(n). The solution then goes on an says [Setting $g(n)=1$ gives the additional identity $A(n)-2B(n)-2C(n)=1$, which can be used to define B(n) in terms of the simpler functions A(n) and A(n)+C(n).] I wonder, how do i find B(n)?

1845318,"When is the polynomial $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n\,\left(x-a_i\right)+1$ reducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$?","This post is inspired by Prove that the polynomial $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n\,\left(x-a_i\right)-1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. . (A) Find all positive integers $n$ and integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ such that $a_1< a_2 < \ldots < a_n$ and that the polynomial
  $$f(x):=\left(x-a_1\right)\left(x-a_2\right)\cdots\left(x-a_n\right)+1$$
  is a reducible element of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (or equivalently, of $\mathbb{Q}[x]$). To prove (A), one attempt is to show that $f(x)$ can not be a perfect square.  Hence, it is natural to ask the following related problem (B). (B) Find all positive integers $n$ and integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ such that $a_1 \leq  a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n$ and that the polynomial
  $$f(x):=\left(x-a_1\right)\left(x-a_2\right)\cdots\left(x-a_n\right)+1$$
  is a perfect square in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (or equivalently, in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$). While I have solutions to (A) and (B), I don't yet have a solution to the problem (C) given below. (C) Find all positive integers $n$ and integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ such that $a_1 \leq  a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n$ and that the polynomial

  $$f(x):=\left(x-a_1\right)\left(x-a_2\right)\cdots\left(x-a_n\right)-1$$
  is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (or equivalently, in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$). Even more generally, we have this seemingly monstrously difficult problem (E). (E) For given $u\in\mathbb{N}$ and $v\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $\gcd(u,v)=1$, find all integers $n$ and integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ such that $a_1 \leq  a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n$ and that the polynomial
  $$f(x):=u\left(x-a_1\right)\left(x-a_2\right)\cdots\left(x-a_n\right)+v$$
  is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (or equivalently, in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$). If (E) seems too difficult, it may make sense to try when $u$ and $|v|$ are perfect $k$-th powers for some integer $k>1$, when $u$ and $v$ are prime integers or $\pm 1$, or when $a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_n$ is assumed. I know that this post is loaded with multiple questions.  However, as they are very closely related, I don't think it hurts to place them in the same thread. P.S.

1845399,About a partial converse to the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem,"I've been reading the GTM text Topics in Banach Space Theory by Albaic and Kalton. In the appendix, it states the following partial converse to the Banach-Steinhaus theorem: Let $\{S_n\}$ be a sequence of operators from a Banach space $X$ into a normed linear space $Y$ such that $\sup_n\|S_n\|<\infty$.  Then if $T:X\to Y$ is another operator, the subspace
  \begin{align*}
M=\{x\in X:\|S_nx-Tx\|\to0\}
\end{align*}
  is norm-closed in $X$. I came up with the following proof of this result: Put $K=\sup_n\|S_n\|$, let $x_0$ be a limit point of $M$, and let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. There exists $x\in M$ such that 
  \begin{align*}
\|x-x_0\|<\frac{\varepsilon}{2(K+\|T\|)}.
\end{align*}
  For this $x$, there is some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that 
  \begin{align*}
\|S_nx-Tx\|<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}
\end{align*}
  for $n\geq N$. For such $n$, we have
  \begin{align*}
\|S_nx_0-Tx_0\|&\leq \|S_nx-Tx\|+\|S_n+T\|\cdot\|x_0-x\| \\
&<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
\end{align*}
  Thus $\|S_nx_0-Tx_0\|\to0$, and therefore $x_0\in M$. QED However, in my proof the assumption that $X$ be a Banach space appears unnecessary.  So my question is somewhat twofold:  Is there something I overlooked in my proof? If not, is the assumption that $X$ is complete superfluous?","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'banach-spaces']"

1845418,Base point free linear system,"Let $X$ be a (compact) Riemann surface. Let $D$ be a divisor. In Rick Miranda's book on Riemann surfaces, on page 160, there is a bijection between Base-point-free linear systems of dimension $n$ on $X$ holomorphic maps $\phi: X \to \mathbb P^n$ with nondegenerate image, up to linear coordinate changes Suppose $|D|$ is nonempty and corresponds to a basis $f_0, \dots f_n$ in $L(D)$. Without assuming $|D|$ is base-point-free, I can still get a map $\phi: X \to \mathbb P^n$ by $p \mapsto [f_0(p): \dots : f_n(p)]$. If you're worried about common poles or zeros at $p$, we can essentially divide or multiply by some power of $z$ in local coordinates with $p$ corresponding to $0$ (see Lemma 4.2 on page 154). So why do we need base-point-free? Don't all nonempty linear systems give meromorphic functions into projective space? Why do we need to bother with linear systems to get maps into projective space? Shouldn't just having $n+1$ meromorphic functions be enough? To prove the bijection above I do indeed require the linear system to be base-point-free.","['riemann-surfaces', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1845441,"Real Analysis, Folland 2.33 Egoroff's Theorem Modes of Convergence","2.33 Egoroff's Theorem - Suppose that $\mu(X) < \infty$, and $f_1,f_2,\ldots$ and $f$ are measurable complex-valued functions on $X$ such that $f_n\rightarrow f$ a.e. Then for every $\epsilon  > 0$ there exists a set $E\subset X$ such that $\mu(E) < \epsilon$ and $f_n\rightarrow f$ and $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly on $E^c$. Proof - Let $\mu(X) < \infty$ and $\{f_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $f$ be measurable complex-valued functions on $X$ such that $f_n\rightarrow f$ a.e. Then, since $f_n\rightarrow f$ a,e, there exists a set $E\in M$ such that $\mu(E) = 0$ and for all $x\in E^c$, $f_n(x) \rightarrow f(x)$. So we have $f_n\chi_{E_c}\rightarrow fX_{E^c}$ and $f\chi_{E^c} = f$ a.e. Now without loss of generality assume $f_n\rightarrow f$ pointwise. For $n,k$ define $E_n(k) = \bigcup_{m=k}^{\infty}\{|f_m - f|\geq 1/k\}$. Then clearly $E_n(k)$ is decreasing since $E_{n+1}(k)\subseteq E_n(k)$ and $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n = \emptyset$ by pointwise converence. So by continuity from above $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\mu(E_n(k)) = 0$. Let $\epsilon > 0$, for each $k$, choose $n_k$ such that $\mu(E_{n_k}) < \epsilon 2^{-k}$. Set $E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_{n_k}(k)$ then $\mu(E) < \epsilon$. So we have uniform convergence on $X\setminus E$. I tried to follow what Folland did but I am not sure if this is correct completely and I honestly don't really like his approach. If there is an alternative way of proving this theorem any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

1845683,$0\to C'\to C\to C''\to0$ splits if $C\cong C'\oplus C''$ as a chain complex?,"Question Given a unitary ring $A$ and an exact sequence $$0\to C'\xrightarrow iC\xrightarrow pC''\to0$$ in the Abelian category of chain complexes over $A$ , where $C,C',C''$ are chain complexes of finitely-generated free modules (I don't know whether this could be replaced by projective modules). If $C\cong C'\oplus C''$ as chain complexes, is it true that the original exact sequence splits in the Abelian category of chain complexes? Results If $A$ is a field or a PID , and that the complexes (the total complexes seen as $A$ -modules) are of finite rank, then the statement could be proved as follows: Let $\mathcal A$ be the Abelian category of chain complexes over $A$ . Take $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal A}(C'',-)$ , we have an exact sequence: $$0\to\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C')\xrightarrow{i_*}\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C)\xrightarrow{p_*}\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C'')$$ Since $C\cong C'\oplus C''$ , we have $\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C)\cong\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C')\oplus\operatorname{Hom}(C'',C'')$ , and we should note that all these $\operatorname{Hom}$ 's are submodules of free modules, hence free ( $A$ is a PID) . It follows from dimension counting that $p_*$ is surjective, hence the original exact sequence splits. Backgrounds It's a generalization of Roth's theorem. Given matrices $A,B,C$ over a commutative ring $R$ and let $$P=\begin{bmatrix}B&0\\&C\end{bmatrix}$$ and $$P_A=\begin{bmatrix}B&A\\&C\end{bmatrix}$$ Then If $P,P_A$ are equivalent, then there exists $X,Y$ such that $A=BX-YC$ . If $B,C$ are square matrices and $P,P_A$ are similar, then there exists $X$ such that $A=BX-XC$ . The first statement follows from the question (if it's true): we consider two complexes $$K\colon\to0\to K_0=R^\bullet\xrightarrow CR^\bullet\to0\to$$ and $$L\colon\to R^\bullet\xrightarrow BL_0=R^\bullet\to0\to0\to$$ The chain homomorphism $f$ is given by the matrix $A\colon K_0\to L_0$ (and zero on any other degree). Consider the canonical exact sequence involving a mapping cone: $$0\to L\to\operatorname{cone}(f)\to K[-1]\to0$$ Note that the matrix associated to the boundary operator of $\operatorname{cone}(f)$ is $P_A$ (up to some signs), which means that $\operatorname{cone}(f)\cong L\oplus K[-1]$ . We apply the result of the question, and it follows directly that $f$ is null homotopic, hence we can solve the matrix equation. The second statement follows from the first statement. If $P,P_A$ are similar, then $T-P,T-P_A$ are equivalent over the ring $R[T]$ , hence there exists $P(T)\in\operatorname{Mat}(R[T])$ and $Q(T)\in\operatorname{Mat}(R[T])$ (we omit the computation of the magnitude of matrices) such that $(T-B)P(T)+Q(T)(T-C)=A$ . If we factor $Q(T)=(T-B)Q_1(T)+Q_0$ , we have $$(T-B)(P(T)+Q_1(T)(T-C)+Q_0)+BQ_0-Q_0C=A.$$ Compare the remainder term, we obtain $BQ_0-Q_0C=A$ .

1845690,Is it possible for an irreducible polynomial with rational coefficients to have three zeros in an arithmetic progression?,"Assume that $p(x)\in \Bbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible of degree $n\ge3$. Is it possible that $p(x)$ has three distinct zeros $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$ such that $\alpha_1-\alpha_2=\alpha_2-\alpha_3$? As also observed by Dietrich Burde a cubic won't work here, so we need $\deg p(x)\ge4$. The argument goes as follows. If $p(x)=x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0$, then
$-c_2=\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3=3\alpha_2$ implying that $\alpha_2$ would be rational and contradicting the irreducibility of $p(x)$. This came up when I was pondering this question . There the focus was in minimizing the extension degree
$[\Bbb{Q}(\alpha_1-\alpha_2):\Bbb{Q}]$. I had the idea that I want to find a case, where $\alpha_1-\alpha_2$ is fixed by a large number of elements of the Galois group $G=\operatorname{Gal}(L/\Bbb{Q})$, $L\subseteq\Bbb{C}$ the splitting field of $p(x)$. One way of enabling that would be to have a lot of repetitions among the differences $\alpha_i-\alpha_j$ of the roots $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\in\Bbb{C}$ of $p(x)$. For the purposes of that question it turned out to be sufficient to be able to pair up the zeros of $p(x)$ in such a way that the same difference is repeated for each pair (see my answer). But can we build ""chains of zeros"" with constant interval, i.e. arithmetic progressions of zeros. Variants: If it is possible for three zeros, what about longer arithmetic progressions? Does the scene change, if we replace $\Bbb{Q}$ with another field $K$ of characteristic zero?

I think I've already proven $f$ continuous $\implies G$ closed without using compactness, so I think it's supposed to be used in the other direction. Here's my attempt at $G$ is closed $\implies f$ is continuous: Let $(x_n)\subset X$ be a sequence such that $x_n\to x\in X$. Now consider the sequence $((x_n,f(x_n)))\subset G$. Since $G$ is closed, $L=\text{lim}(x_n,f(x_n))\in G$. But $L=(\text{lim} x_n,\text{lim} f(x_n))=(x,\text{lim} f(x_n))$. So for $L$ to be in $G$, we must have $\text{lim}f(x_n)=f(x)=f(\text{lim}x_n)$.

If my memory serves me right, that problem was about a sequence excluding triangular numbers, and the sequence was given by something of the form $n\mapsto\left\lfloor n+\sqrt{an+b}+c\right\rfloor$ for some rational numbers $a,b,c$.  Does anybody know anything about such problems (such as where these problems are form, or whether there are other similar problems)?  I believe that I have also seen other similar problems.  Hence, I am trying to establish something akin to a quadratic version of Beatty's Theorem . In this post, $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of positive integers (i.e., $0\notin\mathbb{N}$).  Let $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ be a near-quadratic function , that is, $p$ is a strictly increasing function given by $$p(n):=\left\lfloor\alpha n^2+\beta n+\gamma\right\rfloor \tag{*}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in\mathbb{R}$ with $\alpha>0$ which is called the leading coefficient of $p$.  (Note that, if $\beta>1-3\alpha$, then it is guaranteed that $p$ is strictly increasing.)  Also, an almost-linear function $q:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is defined as $$q(n):=\left\lfloor n+\sqrt{an+b}+c\right\rfloor\tag{**}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a>0$.  We say that two functions $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ and $q:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ are complementary functions iff $$\big\{p(n)\,\boldsymbol{\big{|}}\,n\in\mathbb{N}\big\}\text{ and }\big\{q(n)\,\boldsymbol{\big{|}}\,n\in\mathbb{N}\big\}$$ form a partition of the set of positive integers $\mathbb{N}$. Question: What are all the near-quadratic functions $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that there exists a complementary function $q:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ which is almost-linear?  What is an example of a near-quadratic function $p$ with a complementary function $q$ such that the leading coefficient $\alpha$ of $p$  is irrational?   Which $\alpha>0$ can be the leading coefficient of a near-quadratic function $p$ with a complementary function $q$? According to Jyrki Lahtonen's suggestion, it can be shown that, if (*) and (**) are complementary, then $$a\alpha=1\,.$$  From this result, I have recovered a sequence skipping triangular numbers: $n\mapsto \left\lfloor n+\sqrt{2n}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$.  I have not proven this claim, but I am positive it is correct. Partial Answer: It appears that, for a fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$, if $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is given by $$p(n)=\left\lfloor\dfrac{k}{2}n^2-\frac{(k-2)}{2}n+\frac{k-1}{8}\right\rfloor$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then $q:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined via$$q(n)=\left\lfloor n+\sqrt{\frac{2}{k}n}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is a complementary function to $p$. It also appears that, for a fixed $k\in\mathbb{N}$, if $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is given by
$$p(n):=\left\lfloor\frac{1}{k}n^2+\frac{(k-1)}{k}n\right\rfloor$$
for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then $q:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined via
$$q(n):=\left\lfloor n+\sqrt{kn}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$$
for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is complementary to $p$.   I have not yet tried to prove any of these assertions.","['set-partition', 'reference-request', 'number-theory', 'integers', 'quadratics']"

Let $n(p)$ be this number. While looking for an answer to this question , it seems that the number of primitive roots mod $p$ that are not primitive roots mod $p^2$ (call it $n(p)$), follows a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = -\log\log 2$, in the sense that the proportion of primes up to $x$ which have $n(p)= k$ seems to be near

6        1        0 This seems reasonable to me by the following reason: if you pick $g$ a primitive root mod $p^2$, and $t$ is an integer coprime with $p$, then $g^t$ is a primitive root mod $p$, it will be also a primitive root mod $p^2$ if and only if $p \not|\, t$. So if you consider the integers $g^{pt}$ ($t=1,\dots,p$, $(t,p-1)=1$), reduce them mod $p^2$ and count how many fall in the interval $(1,p)$ then you have the numbers we are looking for. If you think that $g^{pt}$ can fall ""randomly"" with equal probability in any set of $p$ incongruent integers mod $p^2$ then it is natural to expect this number to follow a Poisson distribution. The parameter $\lambda$ of the Poisson distribution should be something like the mean value of $\phi(p-1)/p$. It seems that $\lambda = -\log \log 2$ works fine but it could be any number around. My question is if there is a way to compute the real value of $\lambda$ (if it exists) and what might be it's real value, or a reason why $\lambda = -\log\log 2$ might or not be a reasonable guess. By the way computing the mean value of $\phi(p-1)/p$ seems to be something around $0.374\dots$ while $-\log\log 2 = 0.3665...$ but the approximation using this constant is worse than using $-\log\log 2$.","['probability-theory', 'number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'primitive-roots', 'poisson-distribution']"

1845868,Proof verification: Mantel's theorem,"if a graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices contains no triangles than  it contains at most $n^2/4$ edges. Proof: Let v$\in$V be a vertex of maximum degree k. since G contains no triangles, there are no edges between each two of his $k$ neighbors. Thus, each neighbor has a maximum degree of n-k, 
by that we have that the sum of all $v$ neighbors degree is  at most $k(n-k)$. each of the other $n-k$ vertices in $G$ (which are not neighbors of v), including v itself, has maximum degree of k, by that, the sum of this vertices is at most $k(n-k)$.

Now every time we want to use some property that is true for integrals over whole space $X$, we have to do manipulations with $\chi_E$. For example, let $f_n$ be a sequence in $L^+$ such that $f_n(x) \nearrow f(x)$ for all $x \in E$. Suppose we know that monotone convergence theorem is true for integrals over $X$ and we want to prove
$$\int_E f = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_E f_n.$$
Since $f_n\chi_E \nearrow f\chi_E$ we have
$$\int_E f = \int_X f\chi_E = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X f_n\chi_E = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_E f_n.$$

forgot something or did something wrong. I would appreciate your advice and help ""let G be a simple graph above vertices {1,2,...,n} while $n\ge3$ and $n\in N$.
furthermore, vertex number 1 is of degree $n-1$ and every other vertex is of degree 1.

the first vertex is of degree $n-1$, while there're n vertices. meaning the vertex of degree $n-1$ is connected to the rest of $n-1$ neighbours.
So as we see there's a path between each two vertices in G -> G is connected graph. another way I thought of: from the degrees theorem: $2|E|=\Sigma v_i=(n-1)*[1]+[n-1]=2n-2 \to |E|=n-1$ and there's a theorem
that tells that a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a connected graph. Prove that G is a graph without cycles: let's notice that G is isomorphic to a Bipartite graph while vertices of degree 1 are group A of vertices and the vertex of
degree $n-1$ is group B of vertices. and there's a theorem that tells that every Bipartite graph

1846078,Topology of CW-complex and attaching map,"I think I must have a fundamental misconception in place right now in my mind. When defining a CW-complex, we use inductively continuous maps from $f_{\partial \sigma} :S^n \to K^{(n)}$. We then define a natural map $f_{\sigma}: D^{n+1} \to K^{(n+1)}$ which proceeds with the construction. For this, we take the disjoint union $\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n}$ over the cells we are attaching and define $$K^{(n+1)} =  \left(\bigsqcup\limits_{\sigma} D_{\sigma}^{n} \right) \cup_f K^{(n)}  .$$ Now, why do we need $f_{\partial \sigma}$ to be continuous?  The definition of the topology on $K^{(n+1)}$ does not require continuity of $f_{\partial \sigma}$. We have a disjoint union, and a quotient map, which defines the quotient topology. Also, the $f_{\sigma}$ seem to be continuous, even if $f_{\partial \sigma}$ is not. This would follow from the fact that $f_{\sigma}$ is equal to $\pi \circ i$, where $\pi$ is the quotient map and $i$ is the inclusion map on the disjoint union, and those maps are continuous. $f_{\sigma}$ being continuous implies $f_{\sigma}|_{S^{n}}$ being continuous, since it is just the restriction. But such restriction is commonly considered as the attaching map $f_{\partial \sigma}$ itself, which (by what I said above) need not be continuous for such definitions to make sense. The problem at hand, it seems, is that the induced topology on $K^{(n)}$ as a subspace is not the same as the topology of $K^{(n)}$ itself, and maybe this is why we require the attaching maps to be continuous (in order for restriction to preserve the expected topologies), but I'm not sure. My question, summing up the issues, is: What is the relevance of the attaching map being continuous? If it is not, what kind of issues arise?","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'cw-complexes']"

But, when expressed as an exponent, doesn't this really just mean the following: $X^{2/2} = |X|$, if this is the case, and I simplify the rational exponent, I would get: $X^{1/1}$ or $X^1$, which does not equal $|X|$. Also, if I apply the following rule of a radical function: $\sqrt[n]{P^Q} = (\sqrt[n]P)^Q$ where n is the index of the root and $Q$ is the power of the radicand, then this should mean that: $\sqrt{X^2} = (\sqrt{X})^2$, but the $(\sqrt{X})^2$ does not equal $|X|$ and has a domain where $X > 0$, while the $\sqrt{X^2}$ has a domain equal to all real values for $X$. Does this mean that when $X$ is raised to an even-numbered power and is the radicand in a radical expression, that one should not simplify the rational exponent or one should not rewrite the radical expression such that the power of the radicand $X$ now lies outside of the root function?

Seemingly we must implicitly be using the universal property relating $V \otimes V$ (tensor product) and $V \times V$ (Cartesian product). But we can define the same type of (matrix) multiplication for $V \otimes V^*, V^* \otimes V,$ or $V^* \otimes V^*$ or between elements of any two. Thus now even the claim that matrices represent linear transformations and that matrix multiplication is the composition of linear maps seems suspect to me. Is this just a result of the fact that linear algebra was invented before multilinear algebra/tensor analysis, and thus people were abusing notation when using matrices without realizing it but then the convention stuck? Or is there something more to this which I am missing? Related but more abstract and slightly different question: How do we describe standard matrix multiplication using tensor products?

We have written down that this definition fullfils the Levi-Civita connection definition, but actually I don't even see why it is a connection. For example why does $D_{f \cdot X}Y = f \cdot D_XY$ for an arbitrary $f \in C^{\infty}(\Reals^n)$ hold? My ideas: Interpreting p as a tangent vector one could use the $\Reals$-linearity of the vectorfield:
\begin{align*}
D_{f \cdot X}Y(p)
  &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{Y(p + t(f \cdot X)(p))-Y(p)}{t} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{Y(p + tf(p) \cdot X(p))-Y(p)}{t} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{Y(p) + tf(p)Y(X(p))-Y(p)}{t} \\
  &= f(p) \cdot \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{tY(X(p))}{t} \\

1846909,Concentration of infinite-dimensional Gaussian Measure,"I have the question about finding the subspace of concentration of a Gaussian Measure. More precisely: $\textbf{Question:}$ Assume we have a separable Hilbert space $\ell_2$ with Borel $\sigma$-algebra $B(\ell_2)$ and a centered Gaussian measure $\mu$, i.e. we consider the probability space $(\ell_2, B(\ell_2), \mu)$. There is also a linear continuous operator $Q:\ell_2 \rightarrow (\mathbb{R}^{\infty},\rho)$, where $\rho$ is a metric defined by the formula:
\begin{equation}
 \rho(x,y) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2}\frac{|x_k - y_k|}{1 + |x_k - y_k|}, \, x,y\in \mathbb{R}^{\infty}.
\end{equation}
Operator $Q$ pushforwards $\mu$ on $\ell_2$ to measure $Q_{*}(\mu)$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$. How to check that still measure $Q_{*}$ concentrates on $\ell_2\subset \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$, i.e. $Q_{*}(\mu)[\ell_2] = 1$? $\textbf{Comment:}$ Thanks for the notes of Natan Eldredge from Cornell Univ. I have some ideas how to do it. At first one should say that Gaussian measure on a Hilbert space in this case defined uniquely by its covariance operator on a dual space $\Sigma^{-2} = \mathrm{Cov}(\mu)$ which is of a trace class operator. 
So operator $Q$ expands the norm of a Gaussian vector and geometrically the idea is to check that a new covariance operator of $Q_*(\mu)$ is also of a ""trace"" class. However the propery of being a trace class operator has no rigorous meaning, since $Q_*(\mu)$ is a measure not on a Hilbert space, but on $(\mathbb{R}^{\infty},\rho)$. So one should do a bit different construction. Having a quadratic form $\Sigma^{-2}$ on $\ell_2$ it is possible to write explicitly the new quadratic form on $(\mathbb{R}^{\infty},\rho)^*$ which is 
$Q\Sigma^{-2}Q^*$. It induces the Hilbert structure on dual space $(\mathbb{R}^{\infty},\rho)^*$ which is a dual space for Cameron-Martic space (ofcourse having a completion before in a new scalar product norm). Hence we can find a Cameron-Martin space of measure $Q_*(\mu)$.  After that we aim to do the reconstruction of concentrtation space, via finding the measurable norm for this Cameron-Martin space -- if we want to prove that measure $Q_*$ concentrates on $\ell_2$ we check that $\|\cdot\|_2$ is a measurable norm in this CM space. If it is so, we find the completion of CM space in this norm and we are done. $\textbf{Minor Question:}$
The last argument above is kind of obvious, but still not clear a bit. It is related to the uniqueness of reconstruction of space via CM space (obviously it is not unique), 
but to make the full proof one should say that the reconstructed space with reconstructed Gaussian measure coincide with the measure I began -- $Q_*(\mu)$. Any suggestions? Also if you find any mistake in my comment, please welcome to remark. It took me some effort to get this construction (however the question sounds rather naturally for Gaussian measures) and I havent seen any links related to such question.","['functional-analysis', 'probability']"
