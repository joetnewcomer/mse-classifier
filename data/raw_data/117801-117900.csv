1744567,Basis of a Cyclotomic Field,"I've started learning algebraic number theory when I found something that confused me; for a prime $p$, where $\zeta=e^{(2\pi i/p)}$, a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Then the extension $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta]$ has basis $\{1,\zeta,\zeta^2...\zeta^{p-2}\}$. Could someone explain why the basis doesn't contain all $p$ roots? And was the choice of not including $\zeta^{p-1}$ arbitrary, or did it have to be that root in particular?

1744733,Hypersurfaces have no embedded points (Vakil 5.5.I),"Here's a question from Vakil's FOAG. If $f\in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is non-zero, show that $A:=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(f)$ has no embedded points. Hint: suppose $\bar{g}\in A$ is a zero-divisor, and choose a lift $g\in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of $\bar{g}$. Show that $g$ has a common factor with $f$. The hint is easily proven: if $\bar{g}\bar{h} = 0$ with $\bar{h}\neq 0$ in $A$, then $gh\in (f)$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ for some lift $h$ of $\bar{h}$. $h\notin (f)$ since $\bar{h}\neq 0$, so $g$ has a common factor with $f$ since $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a UFD. Unfortunately, I do not see how the hint is related to embedded points. Presumably it has something to do with the following property of associated primes which is assumed to be true: (C) An element $f$ of a Noetherian ring $A$ is a zero-divisor of the finitely generated $A$-module $M$ (i.e., there exists $m \neq 0$ with $fm = 0$) if and only if it vanishes at some associated point of $M$ (i.e., is contained in some associated prime of $M$). I feel like I'm missing something obvious here. Could someone help me out please? Note that Vakil is adopting a geometric approach here: associated points are defined to be the generic points of irreducible components of the support of some element, and primary decomposition has not been developed, so it would be great if an answer could be given from this geometric perspective.",['algebraic-geometry']
1744753,Pure states on $C(X)$ are exactly evaluations,"Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. I want to show that pure states are of the form $ \phi (f) =f(x)$. By Reisz Represenation Theorem states on $C(X)$ are of the form $\phi (f)= \int fd\mu$ where $\mu$ is a probability regular borel measure. I'm also familiar with the equivalent defenition: $\phi$ is pure iff for every positive functional $\psi$ satisfying $\psi \le \phi$ there exists $t \in [0,1]$ s.t. $\psi = t \phi$. $\Rightarrow$Suppose $\phi$ is an evaluation and show it's pure: write $\phi = t \psi_1 + (1-t) \psi_2$ for $t \in [0,1]$, and $\psi_1, \psi_2 \in S(A)$  so $\forall f\in C(X)$ we have $f(x)=\phi(f) = t \psi_1(f) + (1-t) \psi_2(f)=t\int fd\mu_1+ (1-t)\int fd\mu_2$ for some $\mu_1, \mu_2$ borel, regular probability measures. If I could take $f=\chi_{\{x\}}$ I think I can finish the argument. Maybe I should approximate this indicator by continuous functions in $L^1$, but I'm not sure it's the right direction.

1744760,Scalar multiplication as a special form of matrix multiplication,"Question What do we gain or lose, conceptually, if we consider scalar multiplication as a special form of matrix multiplication ? Background The question bothers me since I have been reading about dilations and scaling of geometrical objects in Paul Lockhart's book ""Measurement"". Geometrically, dilation is a transformation that stretches an object in one dimension by a certain factor. Analogously, the linear transformation
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
""stretches"" the third component by the factor $\lambda$. Scaling is a geometric transformation that stretches an object in all dimensions by a certain factor. Analogously, the linear transformation
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  \lambda & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & \lambda & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
""stretches"" all three components by the factor $\lambda$. This, however, can be written more succinctly using scalar multiplication:
$$
\lambda
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  x_3
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
In fact, every scalar multiplication can be expressed as a multiplication with a special matrix, and it turns out to be a mere shortcut. On the face of it, this observation is not very spectacular; however, it raises interesting philosophical and conceptual questions as to the foundations of linear algebra. For example, if scalar multiplication is only a nice-to-have shortcut, then isn't it in fact superfluous conceptually? Currently, scalar multiplication is taught as if it was a distinct concept, independent of matrix multiplication. What would change if we got rid of this shortcut? What could alternative axioms of vector spaces and moduls look like? What about linear transformations? What is easier, what is harder$-$not to write down, but conceptually? I know that this topic is very broad, but I would like to collect opinions, ideas, examples.","['linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'philosophy']"

1744851,Why doesn't this definition of natural numbers hold up in axiomatic set theory?,"I was reading about older definitions of the natural numbers on Wikipedia here (in retrospect, not the best place to learn mathematics) and came across the following definition for the natural numbers: (paraphrased) Let $\sigma$ be a function such that for every set $A$, $\sigma(A) := \{ x \cup \{ y \} \mid x \in A \wedge y \notin x \} $. Then $\sigma(A)$ is the set obtained by adding any new element to all elements of $A$. Then define $0 := \{ \emptyset \}$, $1 := \sigma(0)$, $2 := \sigma(1)$ et cetera. The way I understood this definition is that the natural number $n$ is ""defined"" as the set of all sets with exactly $n$ elements. This sounded straightforward to me, until I read the next paragraph: This definition works in naive set theory, type theory, and in set theories that grew out of type theory, such as New Foundations and related systems. But it does not work in the axiomatic set theory ZFC and related systems, because in such systems the equivalence classes under equinumerosity are ""too large"" to be sets. For that matter, there is no universal set V in ZFC, under pain of the Russell paradox. Why exactly doesn't this definition work in ZFC? I don't fully understand how the sets in this definition are ""too large"". Is part of the problem just that there is no ""universal set"" to pick the element $y$ from? I tried to do some more reading to find my answer, but the material was way out of my depth. (I am only familiar with the basics of set theory, Russell Paradox, Cantor diagonal argument, and not much more. ) So I apologize in advance if this is a really simple question...","['foundations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1744950,Is there a binary operation satisfying these conditions?,"Last night I started to read some book that has to do with applications of groups in physics and the question came in my mind about the existence of some structure, which I define in this way: Suppose that we have set $S$ which has at least countably infinite number of elements which is equipped with the binary operation $*$ and that we have: 1) $\forall x,y \in S$ we have $x*y \in S$ 2) There exist one and only one $e \in S$ such that we have $x*e=e*x=x$, for every $x \in S$. 3) For every $x \in S$ there exist $l \in S$ and $r \in S$ such that we have $l*x=e$ and $x*r=e$ and $l \neq r$. So this structure is similar to the group in that that it satisfies closure axiom and it has unique identity element but it is different from group in that that every element has left and right inverse which do not coincide and we do not assume associativity. Since I know that there are a lot of structures in mathematics if this structure exists it is probably not something new, but I do not know. And now the question: Does structure defined in this way exist?",['abstract-algebra']

1745070,Understanding Operator Norm of Matrices,"Let $X$ denote the vector space of $n\times n$ complex matrices. To every matrix $A\in X$ one can associate two operator norms: Thinking of $A$ as a map $A\colon \mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ or $A\in L(\mathbb{C}^n)$ in short, we define $\|A\|_{L(\mathbb{C}^n)}=\sup_{v\in \mathbb{C}^n, \|v\|=1}{\|Av\|}$. Thinking of $A$ as a map $A\colon X\to X$ or $A\in L(X)$ in short, we define $\|A\|_{L(X)}=\sup_{B\in X, \|B\|_{L(\mathbb{C}^n)}=1}{\|AB\|}$. It is well-known that $\|A\|_{L(\mathbb{C}^n)}=s_1(A)$ where $s_1$ is the largest singular value of $A$. My questions are: Is there is a (spectral?) characterization of $\|A\|_{L(X)}$? or perhaps a relation between the two above norms? Is there any application of the second norm (in, say functional analysis)? I will explain below why I started thinking about this norm in the first place. I was trying to understand the following paragraph that lead to my questions above. ""If $X$ is equipped with the operator norm $\|\cdot\|_{L(\mathbb{C}^n)}$, then its dual space $X^*$ is the space $X$ equipped with the trace norm $\|\cdot\|_1=\text{ sum of singular values}$, and vice versa.""

1745083,What is the optimal path between $2$ fixed points around an invisible obstructing wall?,"Every day you walk from point A to point B, which are $3$ miles apart. There is a $50$% chance each walk that there is an invisible wall somewhere strictly between the two points (never at A or B). The wall extends $1$ mile in each direction perpendicular to the line segment (direct path) between A and B, and its position can be at any random location between the two points. That is, it can be any distance between A and B such as $0.1$ miles away from A, $1.5$ miles away, $2.9$ miles away.... You don't know if the wall is present or where it is until you walk into it.  You must walk around the wall if present as there is no other way to circumvent it.  Assume the wall is negligible thickness (like a force field), all ground is perfectly flat, and the y coordinates at both A and B are $0$ (although I don't think the optimal path will change much if they weren't). What strategy minimizes the average expected walk distance between A and B?  How do we know for certain this strategy yields the shortest average walking distance? To get the $100$ bounty points, I would like a convincing argument from you as to why you feel your solution is optimal and cannot be beaten.  For those of you using computer simulation, anything reasonably close to optimal is a candidate for the bounty. Can anyone beat the optimal solutions submitted so far?  There are still a few days to try.  Even a slight beat (if not due to roundoff error or some other error) would help prove previous solutions are non-optimal.  You can just use the table of $31$ points (x-y coordinates) and compute that path length and then if you can find better then I will accept that answer.

For every $\left| z \right| < R$, by Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives we have that $$ \left| f'(z) \right| = \frac{1}{2 \pi } \left| \int_{|\zeta|=R} \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta - z)^2} \, d\zeta \right|= \frac{1}{2 \pi } \left| \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta - z)^2} \, \zeta'(t) dt \right| \le$$ $$\le \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\varepsilon \left| z \right|}{(R - \left| z \right|)^2} 2\pi R = \frac{\varepsilon \left| z \right|}{(R - \left| z \right|)^2} R.$$ Thus, letting $R \rightarrow \infty$ yields the desired result, that is  $$\left| f'(z) \right| \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \frac{\varepsilon \left| z \right|}{(R - \left| z \right|)^2} R = 0 \implies f(z) = c \;\; \text{with} \; c \in \mathbb{C}.$$ Is my work correct?

$$
\mathrm{ht}\:\mathfrak{p}+\mathrm{coht}\:\mathfrak{p} \leq \dim R
$$
In the special circumstance of the coordinate ring of an (irreducible) affine variety, i.e. $R$ being a finitely generated $K$-algebra which is an integral domain we have the equality
$$
\mathrm{ht}\:\mathfrak{p}+\mathrm{coht}\:\mathfrak{p} = \dim R\quad (*)
$$ I was curious on when (which type of rings) this equality $(*)$ happens? By the way, does this equality/inequality have a name? First of all seems like we better assume $\dim R<\infty$ for preventing things to go haywire. 
Then if $\mathfrak{p}_0\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_m=\mathfrak{p}$ is a chain the length of which is $\mathrm{ht} \: \mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{p}\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n=\mathfrak{m}$ a chain the length of which is $\mathrm{coht}\: \mathfrak{p}$, then defining $n$ as the length of the two chains combined:
$$n\leq  \mathrm{ht}\:\mathfrak{m}\leq \dim R.$$
So we have two inequalities we need to satisfy. The second inequality can be satisfied by assuming $R$ is equicodimensional , i.e. $\operatorname{ht}\mathfrak{m}=\dim R$ for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$. The first one is trickier. It is happening because it is possible to have another maximal chain of primes inside $\mathfrak{m}$ which doesn't pass through $\mathfrak{p}$ and its length is bigger than $n$. I know of one way to make this imposible (which may not be the most general condition): Fact : If $R$ is a equicodimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring then every maximal chain of prime ideals is of the same length $\dim R$. So what I have come up with is if $R$ is a equicodimensional CM-ring then the equality (*) holds (right?).

I've been given theorems that allow me to just assert that $\ln x$ is continuous on the interval, as I know $1$ is continuous, $x$ is continuous, and so if $\ln x$ is continuous then as we have a composition of continuous functions, $\frac{1}{x\ln x}$ will be continuous on $[2,\infty)$.

Prove that: $$\oint_{|z| = r} {{dz}\over{P(z)}} = 0$$
  Here, the direction of the integral is the positive direction(actually, it can take whatever direction, because the value of the integral is 0). What I tried so far: Applying D'Alembert-Gauss theorem, we can write $P(z) = (z-z_1)^{p_1}(z-z_2)^{p_2}...(z-z_n)^{p_n}$, here $z_i$ are complex numbers which different from each other. We can choose for each $i = 1,...,n$ a $r_i > 0$ small enough such that $B(p_i,r_i)$ are disjoint with each others and all belong to $B$. So use Cauchy theorem for compact Jordan region generated by $B$ and $B(p_i, r_i)$, it's easy to see that:
$$\oint_{|z| = r} {{dz}\over{P(z)}} = \sum_1^{n}{\oint_{|z-z_i|=r_i} {{dz}\over{P(z)}}} =  \sum_1^{n}{\oint_{|z-z_i|=r_i} {{\prod_{j \neq i}{1 \over {(z-z_j)^{p_j}}}}\over{(z-z_i)^{p_i}}}}$$. Then I tried to apply Cauchy theorem for each ${\oint_{|z-z_i|=r_i} {{\prod_{j \neq i}{1 \over {(z-z_j)^{p_j}}}}\over{(z-z_i)^{p_i}}}}$:
$$f^{(k)}(z) = {k! \over {2 \pi i}} \oint_{\partial{B}}{{f(t) \over (t-z)^{k+1}}dt}$$, here $\partial{B}$ is notion for the boundary of the disk $B$ But I got stuck when trying to calculate the $(p_i - 1)$-th derivative for ${\prod_{j \neq i}{1 \over {(z-z_j)^{p_j}}}}$.

1746268,"Matrix norm inequality : $\| Ax\| \leq |\lambda| \|x\|$, proof verification","Suppose that $A$ is a normal $n\times n$ matrix.  Show that $\|Ax \| \geq |\lambda_n|\|x\|$ for all 
  $x \in \mathbf{C}^n$, if $\lambda_n$ is the eigenvalue to $A$ of smallest absolute value. Is this also always true when $A$
  is not normal?  Give a proof
  or a counterexample! First question, does this depend on which norm I choose? Since $x\in\mathbf{C}^n$, then I am inclined to choose the induced norm (whatever its real name is), but I do not know where $A$ exists. If I can choose the 'natural one', then $$ \|Ax\|^2 = (Ax,Ax) = x^*A^*Ax.$$ Since $A$ is normal, it is unitarily similar to diagonal matrix $\Lambda$, so if $y = Ux$ (isometry) one gets $$ x^*A^*Ax = x^*U^*\Lambda^*\Lambda U x = y^*\Lambda^*\Lambda y = 
\sum_i^n |\lambda_i|^2 |y_i|^2 \geq |\lambda_n|^2 \|y\|^2$$
and because $\|y\| = \|x\|$ one gets $\|Ax\| \geq |\lambda_n|\|x\|$. Is this correct? Suppose $A$ not normal, then one can obtain the SVD $A = W\Sigma V^*$ and apply a similar proof
$$ \|Ax\|^2 = \dots = x^*V\Sigma^* \Sigma V^* x.
$$
Take $v = V^*x$, isometric, and singular values $\sigma_1 \geq \dots \geq \sigma_n \geq 0$, one gets
$$ x^*V\Sigma^*\Sigma V^*x = v^*\Sigma^*\Sigma v = \sum_i^n \sigma_i^2 |v_i|^2
\geq \sigma_n^2 \|v\|^2
$$
so, $\|v\| = \|x\|$ one gets $\|Ax\| \geq \sigma_n\|x\|$. And since 
$\sigma_n = \sqrt{\lambda_n} \geq \lambda_n$ for $\lambda_n \leq 1$, the statement is probably not always true, thus I can find a counterexample. I still feel like the not-normal case should be true, since it is on verge of being true, and because of my insecurity with norms and singular values.

As alphabet is a set of symbols used in the language, then in the ZFC set theory$^1$, where every element of a set is another set, these symbols, since they belong to a set, should be sets too. I haven't seen any way to define them as sets (like I did in the case of natural numbers, where for example $0$ is often defined as ${\emptyset}$). Did anyone propose a way how to do such a thing? $^1$I feel like there is a way of using ZFC even before defining a formal language: list the axioms in a natural language$^2$, define set as every object which can be built from these axioms$^3$, build a first-order logic language using this notion of a set, write down the ZFC using this first-order logic language and use this new list of axioms. Is this correct? $^2$The meaning which ZFC tries to convey is possible to be said in a natural language. $^3$In case somebody says that at this level the concept of a set doesn't need to be formalised and is best left to be intuitively understood, one of the reasons ZFC is so popular is that it reproduces intuitive properties of sets - so there seems to be no harm in using ZFC this way.","['formal-languages', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1746326,Relation between Karamata's and Hardy-Littlewood's inequalities,"In the field of (elementary) classical inequalities one of the most famous tools is the majorization inequality due to Karamata [1] (also known as Hardy-Littlewood-Polya ). In its integral version, it states that: If $\psi_1, \psi_2 : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{>0}}$ are non-negative measurable functions and, for example, $\psi_1$ ""majorates"" over $\psi_2$ (usually donated via $\psi_2 \succeq \psi_2$): $$\int_{a}^{s} \psi_1 \, dx \geq \int_{a}^{s} \psi_2 \, dx, \, \forall s \in [a,b) \> \text{ and } \> \int_{a}^{b} \psi_1 \, dx = \int_{a}^{b} \psi_2 \, dx$$
  then for any increasing $\phi : [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ holds:
  $$\int_{a}^{b} \psi_1 \phi \, dx \geq \int_{a}^{b} \psi_2 \phi \, dx .$$ From here one may derive [2] the majority of the classical inequalities: $AM \geq GM$, Muirhead, Schur, Cauchy-Schwartz, Hölder, Minkowski, Jensen, Chebyshev, etc. Besides this one, in the literature there is another famous inequality [3] , named after Hardy and Littlewood - the generalized rearrangement inequality: Let $\phi^*$ donates the symmetric (decreasing) rearrangement of a measurable, non-negative, asymptotically vanishing function $\phi$ defined over $\mathbb{R}^n$ - roughly speaking, $\phi^* (x)$ is the ""height"" at which the ""size"" of the level set $\{ t : \phi(t) > \phi^* (x) \}$ is equal to $x$ (please, excuse me for not going into great depth with the definitions). Then for any two functions $f, g : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ of the above type:
  $$ \int f g \, dx \leq \int f^* g^* \, dx .$$ My question is whether there is any relation between the above inequalities and, more generally, between the concepts of majorization and symmetric rearrangement?

For any real numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$, the statistic

  approximately (sic) follows a chi-squared distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom. Doing a quick Google search, most sources seem to follow a similar formulation.  There are a few questions I have though: How can the number of degrees of freedom of a chi-squared distribution depend on the statistics $S_i$? Shouldn't the number of degrees of freedom be a constant? What does 'approximately follow a distribution' mean? This is closely related to my third question: How can one justify this approximation? All 'proofs' I have seen on the internet seem to assume that $L$ follows a chi-squared distribution and then show that $\nu$ must have the stated value, using basic properties of expected value and variance. Even those arguments are confusing to mee, since they seem to ignore the fact that the $S_i$ are itself stochastic variables and not known constants. I found a link to the original papers by Welch and Satterthwaite , which I can't access freely. I wonder if there is a reasonably short answer to at least the first two of my questions.

$$\lim_{x\to\pi/4}\frac{1-\tan x}{1-\sqrt{2}\sin x}$$ I was able to solve it using L'hopital and the answer that I got was $2$. Can you please confirm if the answer is right and suggest some other way to evaluate the limit without using L'hopital?","['limits-without-lhopital', 'calculus', 'limits']"
1746626,4 cards are drawn from a pack without replacement. What is the probability of getting all 4 from different suits?,"4 cards are drawn from a pack without replacement. What is the probability of getting all 4 from different suits? Here's how I tried to solve: For the first draw, we have 52 cards, and we have to pick one suit. So, probability for this is $\frac{13}{52}$. For the second draw, only 51 cards are left. The second suit has to be selected, so there are 13 cards from that suit. The probability is $\frac{13}{51}$. Similarly, the third and fourth draw have probabilities $\frac{13}{50}$ and $\frac{13}{49}$ respectively. Since the draws are independent, the total probability becomes $$\frac{13}{52} \times \frac{13}{51} \times \frac{13}{50} \times \frac{13}{49}$$ But my book says the answer is $\frac{{13\choose 1} \times {13 \choose 1} \times {13\choose1} \times {13\choose1}}{52 \choose 4}$. My answer differs by a factor of $4!$. What did I do wrong?","['combinatorics', 'probability']"
1746630,Complex power series expansion of $\frac{e^z}{1+z}$,"I'm trying to find complex power series expansion of $\frac{e^z}{1+z}$ centered at $z=0$ and its radius of convergence. Here is my attempt: Since $e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}$, we can divide both terms by $1+z$ to get $e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{(1+z)n!}$. Then I can get radius of convergence using the usual Cauchy-Hadamard formula. Is this correct?
Thanks for any help!","['complex-analysis', 'power-series']"
1746631,Product topology is discrete,"Willard's General Topology says: For each $\alpha\in A$, let $X_{\alpha}$ be discrete topological space. Then $\prod_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}$(under product topology) will be a discrete space if and only if A is finite. But, if $X_{\alpha}=\{1\}$ for each $\alpha\in A$, then  $\prod_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}$ is discrte space, right?",['general-topology']
1746632,topology related to Binary space,"I ran upon this topology based on binary space, perhaps using obscure terminology, but I am curious what it is and its properties. Let binary space be the set of strings of $0,1$'s, and let $S$ be the set of all functions that map the binary space to a set of two elements, $\{0,1\}$. It's like it decides a true or false for every binary string. For the topology $\mathcal{T}$, let a basic set be $U_{V,f}$, where any $g$ in this set must satisfy $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in $V$, and $V$ is a finite subset of $B$. Is this space $(S,\mathcal{T})$ Hausdorff? Compact? Any related material is welcome. Thanks",['general-topology']
1746648,Any subgroup that contains the subgroup generated by all commutators is normal.,"First, I was asked to show that if $G$ is a group and $G'$ is generated by $\{xyx^{-1}y^{-1}|x,y\in G\}$, then $G'\trianglelefteq G$ and $G/G'$ is Abelian. This was not too difficult to show. The second part of the question said if $G$ is a group and $H\supseteq G'$, where $G'$ is as in the last part, then $H\trianglelefteq G$ and $G/H$ is Abelian. I'm not sure of the best way to approach this problem. Any help would be appreciated.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"
1746711,Alternating series test for complex series,"I want to show that we can continue Riemann's zeta function to Re$(s)>0$, $s\neq 1$ by the following formula

(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)&=\left(1-2\frac{1}{2^s}\right)\left(\frac1{1^s}+\frac1{2^s}+\ldots \right) \\
&=\frac1{1^s}+\frac1{2^s}+\ldots -2\left(\frac1{2^s}+\frac1{4^s}+\ldots \right)\\
