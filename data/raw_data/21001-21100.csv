177862,Characteristic functions based proof problem.,"I am trying to show that if $T$ be a closed bounded interval and $E$ a measurable subset of $T$. Let $\epsilon >0$, then there is a step function $h$ on $T$ and a measurable subset $F$ of $T$ for which $h=\chi_E$ on $F$ and $m(T - F)<\epsilon$. Some Thoughts towards the proof. $\forall \epsilon >0$, there is a finite disjoint collection of open intervals $\left\{ I_{k}\right\} _{k=1}^{n}$ for which if $O=U_{k=1}^{n}I_{k}$ then $$m^{*}(E-O) + m^{*}(O-E) < \epsilon.$$ Also $$\chi_{E}=\begin{cases}1, & x\in E \\ 0, & x\notin E. \end{cases} $$ So $\forall \epsilon >0$ we have $\chi_{E} = \chi_{O}$. Now $h$ being a step function looks like $$h =\sum _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}\chi _{T_i}\left( x\right).$$ I am unsure how to proceed from here and show the two results. Any help would be much appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'characteristic-functions', 'real-analysis']"

177877,Prove whether a relation is an equivalence relation,"Define a relation $R$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ by $R = \{(a,b)|a≤b+2\}$. (a) Prove or disprove: $R$ is reflexive. (b) Prove or disprove: $R$ is symmetric. (c) Prove or disprove: $R$ is transitive. For (a), I know that $R$ is reflexive because if you substitute $\alpha$ into the $a$ and $b$ of the problem, it is very clear that $\alpha \leq \alpha + 2$ for all integers. For (b), I used a specific counterexample; for $\alpha,\beta$ in the integers, if you select $\alpha = 1$, and $\beta = 50$, it is clear that although $\alpha ≤ \beta + 2$, $\beta$ is certainly not less than $ \alpha + 2$. However, for (c), I am not sure whether the following proof is fallacious or not: Proof: Assume $a R b$ and $b R g$; Hence $a ≤ b + 2$ and $b ≤ g + 2$ Therefore $a - 2 ≤ b$ and $b ≤ g + 2$ So $a-2 ≤ b ≤ g + 2$ and clearly $a-2 ≤ g+2$ So then $a ≤ g+4$ We can see that although $a$ might be less than $ g+2$,
it is not always true. Therefore we know that the relation $R$ is not transitive. QED. It feels wrong","['relations', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"
177883,Finding a formula for $f^{(n)} (x)$ if $f(x) = \ln(x-1)$,"While working through Stewart's Calculus Late Transcendental 7th edition , I came across this problem: Find a formula for $f^{(n)} (x)$ if $f(x) = \ln(x-1)$. Obviously, I calculated the first few derivatives to see if I could spot a pattern: $$f^{1}(x) = \frac1 {x-1}$$
$$f^{2}(x) = \frac{-1} {(x-1)^2}$$
$$f^{3}(x) = \frac{2}{(x-1)^3}$$
$$f^{4}(x) = \frac{-6}{(x-1)^4}$$
$$f^{5}(x) = \frac{24}{(x-1)^5}$$ I see the pattern of how the numerator is getting multiplied by $-1$ from the first to second derivative, $-2$ from $f^{2}(x)$ to $f^{3}(x)$, then $-3$ from $f^{3}(x)$ to $f^{4}(x)$, etc while the denominator simply increases by one power for each $nth$ derivative. Despite seeing a pattern, I am at a loss of expressing this as a formula. The answer given by Stewart is: $$f^{n}(x) = \frac{(-1)^{n-1} (n-1)!} {(x-1)^{n}}$$ Any advice on how to  come up with a general formula when you see a pattern, but the formula isn't quite so obvious as with the one above?","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

177935,When is $CaCl(X) \to Pic(X)$ surjective?,"I am curious about following similar statements in algebraic geometry and complex geometry: Algebraic Geometry Version:
    If $X$ is an integral scheme, the map from Cartier divisor group to Picard group (i.e. group of invertible sheaves) $CaCl(X) \to Pic(X)$ is surjective. Complex Geometry Version: If $X$ is a complex manifold, then the image of   $CaCl(X) \to Pic(X)$ is generated by those line bundles $L \in Pic(X)$ with $H^0(X,L) \neq 0$. More interesingly, there is a remark for the complex version: Remark: $CaCl(X) \to Pic(X)$ may not be surjective even for very easy manifolds, e.g. a generic complex torus of dimension two, this is no longer the case. My questions is twofold: Explicit one: How to justify the above remark, i.e. $CaCl(X) \to Pic(X)$ may not be surjective for a generic complex torus of dimension two. Inexplicit one: Though I don't know the exact meaning of ""integral manifold"" (or the proper prototype of integral scheme ), it seems for me that ""integrality"" is natrual endowed by a complex manifold(suppose it is connected).

177946,When is an infinite product of natural numbers regularizable?,"I only recently heard about the concept of $\zeta$-regularization , which allows the evaluation of things like $$\infty != \prod_{k=1}^\infty k = \sqrt{2\pi}$$ and $$\infty \# = \prod_{k=1}^\infty p_k = 4\pi^2$$ where $n\#$ is a primorial , and $p_k$ is the $k$-th prime. (The expression for the infinite product of primes is proven here .) That got me wondering if, given a sequence of positive integers $m_k$ (e.g. the Fibonacci numbers or the central binomial coefficients), it is always possible to evaluate the infinite product $$\prod_{k=1}^\infty m_k$$ in the $\zeta$-regularized sense. It would seem that this would require studying the convergence and the possibility of analytically continuing the corresponding Dirichlet series, but I am not too well-versed at these things. If such a regularization is not always possible, what restrictions should be imposed on the $m_k$ for a regularized product to exist? I'd love to read up on references for this subject.

177953,"$f(z)=\int_1^\infty e^{-x}x^z\,dx$ is complex analytic","Note : I'm refereshing my complex analysis skills in order to learn some analytic number theory. Here's one (basic) claim I'd like to prove and my attempt. My questions are: Is my partial attempt correct? Are there better (or shorter) ways to prove it? I may be going a bit too much into the details instead of using general theorems. I'd like to prove that if $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$
is defined by $f(z)=\int_1^\infty e^{-x}x^z\,dx$ then
$f$ is complex analytic. My attempt :
Define $f_n(z)=\int_1^n e^{-x}x^z\,dx$.
Then it's enough to prove that for each $n$, the function $f_n$ is holomoprphic
and that $f_n$ converges uniformly on compact sets. As for the first point, the integral is a limit of Riemann sums and each Riemann sum is complex analytic. So it's enough to prove that the Riemann sums converge to the integral uniformly in compact sets (relative to $z$). I think that follows from equicontinuity of $e^{-x} x^z$ in $[1,n]$ and $Re(z)$ being bounded in compact sets. As for the second point, in a compact set $Re(z)$ is bounded, say, by $K$.
Then $|x^z|\leq x^K$.
Now $$|f_m(z)-f_n(z)|= \left| \int_n^m e^{-x}x^z\,dx\right| \leq\int_n^m e^{-x}|x^z|\,dx \leq
\int_n^m e^{-x}x^K \, dx \overset{n,m\rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow}0.$$

177956,An exercise in infinite combinatorics from Burris and Sankappanavar,"Exercise 6.7 in chapter IV of Burris and Sankappanavar's A Course in Universal Algebra starts as follows: Show that for $I$ countably infinite there is a subset $S$ of the set of functions from $I$ to $2$ which has cardinality equal to that of the continuum such that for $f \not= g$ with $f,g \in S$, $\{i \in I : f(i) = g(i)\}$ is finite. I don't see how $S$ can have cardinality more than 2: let $f, g, h \in S$, with $f \not= g$ and $f \not= h$ and let $A = \{i \in I : f(i) = g(i)\}$ and $B = \{i \in I : f(i) = h(i)\}$. For $i$ in $I\backslash (A \cup B)$ we have $g(i) \not= f(i) \not= h(i)$, whence $g(i) = h(i)$, since $f(i), g(i), h(i) \in 2 = \{0, 1\}$. But $A$ and $B$ are finite, $I \backslash(A\cup B)$ is infinite. So $g(i) = h(i)$ holds for infinitely many $i$ and we must have $g = h$. What have I missed? (A redefinition of 2, perhaps?)

178144,$SU(2)$ subgroups of $SU(3)$: Is my reasoning correct?,"When looking at the standard $3\times3$ representation of $SU(3)$, one immediately recognizes some subgroups isomorphic to $SU(2)$: There is the subgroup acting on the first two elements of the vector, keeping the third one unchanged (and of course, the same for leaving any of the other elements intact). Indeed, it is not hard to see that for any unit vector, there's an $SU(2)$ subgroup acting only on the two vectors othogonal on it. It is also not hard to see that all those subgroups are conjugate to each other. Since the $3\times3$ representation of $SU(2)$ also consists of special unitary matrices, it of course also corresponds a subgroup of $SU(3)$. The elements of this representation can e.g. be written as $\exp(\mathrm i\alpha L_z)\exp(\mathrm i\beta L_x)\exp(\mathrm i\gamma L_z)$ where $L_x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}$ and $L_z=\operatorname{diag}(1,0,-1)$. Now a natural question is whether this last subgroup is conjugate to the previous ones. I've come to the conclusion that it is not, with the following argumentation: It of course suffices to check conjugacy with the subgroup acting on the first two elements (because conjugacy is an equivalence relation). Now the elements of that subgroup all commute with the subgroup of transformations of the form $\operatorname{diag}(\mathrm e^{\mathrm i\phi}, \mathrm e^{\mathrm i\phi}, \mathrm e^{-2\mathrm i\phi})$. However, the members of the $3\times3$ representation of $SU(2)$ only commute with multiples of the unit matrix (three of which are members of $SU(3)$). Therefore the two subgroups cannot be conjugate to each other. Now my question is: Is my reasoning correct?","['lie-groups', 'group-theory']"
178145,"A unitary matrix taking a real matrix to another real matrix, is it an orthogonal matrix?","I tried to prove that a real antisymmetric matrix can be taken by an orthogonal tranformation to a form: where the eigenvalues are $\pm i\lambda_1, \pm i\lambda_2 ...  $ which is a statement I saw on wikipedia in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_matrix I also know an antisymmetric matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation, and I found a unitary transformation taking the diagonal matrix to the required form. So by composing the two transformations (diagonalization, then taking the diagonal matrix to the required form), I'll get a unitary transformation taking the real antisymmetric matrix to another real matrix. My question is if this transformation must be a real matrix? if so I can deduce that the unitary transformation is in fact an orthogonal transformation. So is this true? Is a unitary transformation taking a real matrix to another real matrix necessarily an orthogonal transformation?

Complexity theory deals with how hard a function is to compute.  It's weird to me that I haven't seen anyone merge these fields of study, since they seem like such natural pairs.  Has anyone done this before? As a motivating example, let's take a look at semigroups.  Semigroups have an associative binary operation.  It's well known that operations in semigroups can be parallelized due to the associativity.  For example, if there's a billion numbers we want added together, we could break the problem into 10 problems of adding 100 million numbers together, then add the results. But parallelizing the addition operator makes sense only because it can be computed in constant time and space.  What if this weren't the case?  For example, lists and the append operation form a common semigroup in functional programming, but the append operator takes time and space $O(n)$. It seems like there should be a convenient way to describe the differences between these two semigroups.  In general, it seems like algebras that took into account the complexity of their operations would be very useful to computer scientists like myself.","['category-theory', 'computational-complexity', 'abstract-algebra']"

178491,Why does Strassen's algorithm work for $2\times 2$ matrices only when the number of multiplications is $7$?,"I have been reading Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen. Before explaining Strassen algorithm the book says this: Strassen’s algorithm is not at all obvious. (This might be the biggest understatement in this book.) The book just states the algorithm but don't explain why it works. So if we take the case of multiplication of two $2 \times 2$ matrices, it reduces the number of multiplications from $8$ to $7$ thereby reducing the complexity from  $n^{3}$ to  $n^{\lg 7}$ which is roughly $n^{2.8}$.

178499,"Finding all solutions to $y^3 = x^2 + x + 1$ with $x,y$ integers larger than $1$","I am trying to find all solutions to (1) $y^3 = x^2 + x + 1$, where $x,y$ are integers $> 1$ I have attempted to do this using...I think they are called 'quadratic integers'. It would be great if someone could verify the steps and suggest simplifications to this approach. I am also wondering whether my use of Mathematica invalidates this approach. My exploration is based on a proof I read that $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ has no non-trivial integer solutions. This proof uses the ring  Z[W] where $W = \frac{(-1 + \sqrt{-3})}{2}$. I don't understand most of this proof, or what a ring is, but I get the general idea. The questions I have about my attempted approach are Is it valid? How could it be simplified? Solution: Let $w = (-1 + \sqrt{-3})/2$. (Somehow, this can be considered an ""integer"" even though it doesn't look anything like one!) Now $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x-w)(x-w^2)$ so that, $(x^3 - 1)/(x-1) = x^2 + x + 1  = (x-w)(x-w^2)$. Hence $y^3 = x^2 + x + 1 = (x-w)(x-w^2).$ Since $x-w, x-w^2$ are coprime up to units (so I have read) both are ""cubes"". Letting $u$ be one of the 6 units in Z[w], we can say $x-w = u(a+bw)^3 = u(c + dw)$  where $c = a^3 + b^3 - 3ab^2, d = 3ab(a-b)$ Unfortunately, the wretched units complicate matters. There are 6 units hence 6 cases, as follows: 1)  $1(c+dw) =  c + dw$ 2) $-1(c+dw) = -c + -dw$ 3)  $w(c+dw) = -d + (c-d)w$ 4) $-w(c+dw) =  d + (d-c)w$ 5)  $-w^2(c+dw) = c-d + cw$ 6)  $w^2(c+dw) = d-c + -cw$ Fortunately, the first two cases can be eliminated. For example, if $u = 1$ then $x-w = c+dw$ so that $d = -1 = 3ab(a-b).$ But this is not possible for integers $a,b$. The same reasoning applies to $u = -1$. For the rest I rely on a program called Mathematica, which perhaps invalidates my reasoning, as you will see. We attack case 5. Here $x = c-d = a^3 + b^3 - 3a^2b$, and $c = a^3 + b^3 - 3ab^2 = -1.$ According to Mathematica the only integer solutions to $c = -1$ are 
$(a,b) = (3,2), (1,1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-3), (-2,1).$ Plugging these into $x = c-d$ we find that no value of x that is greater than 1. So case 5 is eliminated, as is 6 by similar reasoning. Examining case 4 we see that $d-c = -(a^3 + b^3 - 3a^2*b) = -1$ with solutions 
$(-2,-3), (-1,-1), (-1,2), (0,1), (1,0), (3,1).$ Plugging these values into $x = d = 3ab(a-b)$ yields only one significant value, namely $x = 18$ (e.g. (a,b)=(3,1) . The same result is given by case 4. Hence the only solution to (1) is $7^3 = 18^2 + 18 + 1$ However, I'm unsure this approach is valid because I don't know how Mathematica found solutions to expressions such as $a^3 + b^3 - 3ab^2=-1$. These seem more difficult than the original question of $y^3 = x^2 + x + 1$, although I note that Mathematica could not solve the latter.","['diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"

The Jacobian of the transformation is 1/2 so the integral becomes $I = \frac{1}{2}\int\int_Ae^\frac{u}{v}dudv $ At this point I had some difficulties. I eventually realized that if I played with the numbers, that u would have upper and lower bounds of 1 and -1 while v would have upper and lower bounds of 1 and 0. So my first attempt was this: $ I = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1dv\int_{-1}^1e^\frac{u}{v}du$ however evaluating this integral was practically impossible (if you don't believe me, try finding an antiderivitive for $xsinh(1/x)$ with elementary techniques!), eventually I realized the integral would simplify if changed the limits as follows: $ I = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1dv\int_{-v}^ve^\frac{u}{v}du$ this yielded the correct answer [$I=0.5sinh(1)$] however I would like to know how to determine how to find regions of integration on change of variables in ways other than guessing at the answer!

\int_{\gamma} e^{\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}}\sin{\pi z} \,\mathrm dz

My attempt By the Residue theorem, since the function $f(z) := e^{\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}}\sin{\pi z}$ has only an isolated singularity at $z = 1$ in the right half plane, which in this case is an essential singularity, we can compute the integral by finding the residue at $1$, more precisely $$
\int_{\gamma} e^{\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}}\sin{\pi z} \, \mathrm dz = 2\pi i N \operatorname{Res}{(f(z); 1)}
$$ where the $N$ comes from the assumption on the index of the curve. Now my problem is that I can't compute this residue. The ""obvious"" things that I have tried are finding the Laurent expansions of the functions $e^{\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}}$ and $\sin{\pi z}$ around $z = 1$. It is easy to find that $$
\sin{\pi z} =  -\frac{\pi}{1!}(z - 1) + \frac{\pi^3}{3!}(z - 1)^3 -\frac{\pi^5}{5!}(z - 1)^5 + \frac{\pi^7}{7!}(z - 1)^7 + \cdots

e^{\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\frac{1}{(z^2 - 1)^n}
$$ and I thought that maybe then expressing the fraction $\frac{1}{z^2 - 1}$ as $$
\frac{1}{z^2 - 1} = \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{1}{z-1} - \frac{1}{z+1} \right )  
$$ and using the Laurent expansion $$
\frac{1}{z+ 1} = \frac{1}{z - 1 + 2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{1 + \frac{z - 1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{(z - 1)^n}{2^n}
$$ could be of help. But now I don't see much hope of this working because I would have to put this last infinite series back into the series for the exponential and there's an $n$-th power there, and finally to top it all I would have to multiply by the Laurent series for the $\sin{\pi z}$ to try to get a hold of the coefficient of $\frac{1}{z - 1}$.

How can one construct $\rm{Cl}(\sqrt{-5})$ by using the quotient groups ? What are the elements of $\rm{Cl}(\sqrt{-5})$ ? What do those elements indicate ? ( I think they must some-how indicate the residues that are preventing the $\mathbb{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ from having a unique factorization ) What does $h(n)$ indicate ? ( Class number ). When $h(n)=1$ it implies that unique factorization exists . But what does the $1$ in $h(n)=1$ indicate. It means that there is one element in the class group , but doesn't that prevent Unique Factorization ? EDIT: I am interested in knowing whether are there any polynomial time running algorithms that list out all the numbers that fail to hold the unique factorization with in a number field ? I am expecting that may be Class group might have something to do with these things. By using the class group of a number field can we extract all such numbers ? For example, if we plug in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ then we need to have $6$ and other numbers that don't admit to a unique factorization. Please do answer the above points and save me from confusion . Thank you.","['number-theory', 'principal-ideal-domains', 'class-field-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'ideals']"

178790,Show $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+\ln^{2}(2\cos(x))}dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\left(1-\gamma+\ln(2\pi)\right)$,"Here is an interesting, albeit tough, integral I ran across. It has an interesting solution which leads me to think it is doable. But, what would be a good strategy?. $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+\ln^{2}(2\cos(x))}dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\left(1-\gamma+\ln(2\pi)\right)$$ This looks rough. What would be a good start?.  I tried various subs in order to get it into some sort of shape to use series, LaPlace, something, but made no real progress. I even tried writing a geometric series. But that didn't really result in anything encouraging. $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\left(\frac{\ln(2\cos(x))}{x}\right)^{2k}$$ Thanks all.","['definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration']"
178796,What is the practical benefit of a function being injective? surjective?,"I have learned that an injective function is one such that no two elements of the domain map to the same value in the codomain. Example: The function $x \mapsto x^2$ is injective when the domain is positive numbers but is not injective when the domain is all numbers because both $(-2)^2$ and $2^2$ map to the same value, $4$. Is there an advantage of an injective function over a non-injective function? What is the practical benefit of injective functions? Or perhaps there is an advantage to a function not being injective? I have also learned about surjective functions: a surjective function is one such that for each element in the codomain there is at least one element in the domain that maps to it. What is the benefit of a function being surjective? Is there a danger to using functions that are not surjective? I'd like to have a deeper understanding of injective and surjective than simply be able to parrot back their definitions. Please help.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
178804,Triangularizing a Matrix,"In Hoffman & Kunze, it is mentioned several times that any matrix with a minimal polynomial that splits over your field into linear factors is similar to an upper triangular matrix.  A proof is given, but it does not give an algorithm for finding such a matrix.  Indeed, they prove that any such linear operator can be decomposed into the sum of a nilpotent linear operator and a diagonalizable linear operator which commute, and can therefore be simultaneously triangularized, but do not seem to give a direct method as to how to actually choose an appropriate basis in practice. I was wondering if there is an algorithm for triangularizing such an operator that does not rely on Jordan canonical form (since triangularization appears before Jordan form in their book) or noticing some clever choice of basis?","['matrix-decomposition', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'triangularization']"
