1401893,"Fast way to show that $\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x) \sin (n\pi x)dx = \frac{4}{(n\pi)^3}$, $n$ odd","I can compute and show that for odd values of $n$, $$\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x) \sin (n\pi x)dx = \frac{4}{(n\pi)^3}$$ fairly easily by expanding the quadratic, splitting the integrand and then evaluating each component using integration by parts. However, this is rather tedious. I was wondering if you could see a way of proving this identity without having to go through so much brute-force computations. The result is relatively neat so I suspect there may be a much easier way of computing the integral. The integral looks perfect for $$\int_{0}^{a}f(x)dx=\int_{0}^{a}f(a-x)dx$$ but I was unable to find a solution using that because I could not somehow find a way to work with $\sin (n\pi(1-x))$ So what I have so far is $$I=\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x) \sin (n\pi x)dx=\int_{0}^{1}x(1-x) \sin (n\pi(1-x))dx$$ But I am now stuck.",['integration']

1402026,$V$-bundles and vector bundles,"I am looking for more information on $V$-bundles. They are hard to search for as either vector bundles come up or something like GL($V$)-bundles come up. I am looking for some nice expository information on them. It seems like one idea of them is if you have a manifold $X$ and a group action of $G$, then $X/G$ might be singular so you can't really have a vector bundle on it. A $V$-bundle is a vector bundle analog where your $V$-bundle is a vector bundle $E$ on $X$ with a family of unitary isomorphisms
$$
\phi_x(g):E(x) \mapsto E(g\cdot x)
$$
Where $E(x)$ is the fiber over $x\in X$. It also needs to satisfy a compatibility condition with the group action. So it's a vector bundle over $X$ but you identify fibers in an appropriate way. What I'm really after is if $X/G$ is smooth , then does a $V$--bundle on $X/G$ actually give a vector bundle on $X/G$? The other direction is less important for me but would still be nice to know.

1402056,solving negative linear congruences,OK so I know how to solve linear congruences when they're positive but negative is a different story.. I have $$ 200x\equiv 13 \pmod {1001} $$ I got the inverse as $$ -5 $$ and then I multiply both sides with the inverse to get: $$ -1000x \equiv -65 \pmod {1001} $$ So $$ x \equiv -65 \mod {1001} $$ Is that correct?

1402071,"If every point is a local maximum, is it a step function?","What are the functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that every point is a local maximum? Certainly, $f(x)=c$ works for every constant. So does $\lfloor x\rfloor$, as does $I_{\{0\}}(x)=\begin{cases}1&x=0\\0&x\ne0\end{cases}$. Another example is the oddly beautiful $e^{-\lfloor1/\lvert x\rvert\rfloor^{-2}}$. Question is, are step functions such as these the only ones? Are there any examples where every point is a strict local maximum? (Thomae's function is a near-miss, since the condition doesn't hold on irrational points. Although, most points are irrational, so I guess the term ""near-miss"" doesn't quite fit.) EDIT: My definition of step-function is the sum of countably many indicator functions of intervals, $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nI_{A_n}(x)$. If it were uncountable, any function would be step, as $\{\alpha\}$ is an interval ($[\alpha,\alpha]$). This arose when I was thinking about the topological space with basis $\{(-\infty,a]:a\in\mathbb R\}$. If you call that space $X$, then the continuous functions $f:\mathbb R\to X$ are precisely these. I don't have a formal proof but I'm pretty sure (and this would belong in a different question anyway). Contrast with: Is $f$ constant if every point is local maximum or local minimum of $f$?","['real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'functions']"
1402091,Existence of moments and slowly varying function at infinity,"I have a somewhat advanced question involving the role of slowly varying functions and their relation to moments. I want to use them to derive certain results for domains of attraction. My problem is the following. Let $L(x) = E[Y^2; |Y|\le x] $ and assume that L(x) is slowly varying to $\infty. $ This means that for any $t >  0,  $ we have $$ \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{L(tx)}{L(x)} = 1. $$ Fix $p\in [0, 2). $ I can prove (it is some work, but not a major task) that
$$ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^{2-p}E[|Y|^p; |Y|>x]}{L(x)} = 0 \hskip 10pt (*) $$ I would like to prove that $E[|Y|^p] < \infty $ for $p \in [0, 2). $ I am aware that there are certain theorems (Karamata type theorems) that use arguments related to the survival function $G(x) = Pr[Y> x] = 1-F(x) $ varying slowly to infinity to derive the existence of certain moments. But, I wonder if what I know, i.e., (*), is enough. My line of attack is the traditional one, i.e.,
$$E[|Y|^p] = E[|Y|^p; |Y|\le x] + E[|Y|^p; |Y|>x] $$
Now the first term on the right-hand side is clearly bounded and I was hoping to use what I learned above to prove that also the second term on the right-hand side is bounded, but I seem to run in some problems. For instance, I could use (*), and write
$$ E[|Y|^p; |Y|>x] = x^{2-p}E[|Y|^p; |Y|>x]/L(x) \cdot \frac{L(x)}{x^{2-p}}. $$
The first term on the right goes to 0 as $x \to \infty, $ however, I have an
$\frac{\infty}{\infty} $ issue on the second term. Am I approaching the issue in the wrong way or am I missing something else? As usual thank you to whoever could chip in some words of wisdom. Maurice","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

1402158,Why does the valence formula imply $M_k=0$ for $k <0$?,"I'm studying Modular Forms and in the notes I'm reading the author states the following result, known as the valence formula: ""Let $f$ be a non-zero weakly modular meromorphic form of

1402201,Prove the theorem on analytic geometry in the picture.,"I discovered this elegant theorem in my facebook feed. Does anyone have any idea how to prove? Formulations of this theorem can be found in the answers and the comments. You are welcome to join in the discussion. Edit:
Current progress: The theorem is proven. There is a bound to curvature to be satisfied before the theorem can hold. Some unresolved issues and some food for thought: (1) Formalise the definition (construction) of the parallel curve in the case of concave curves. Thereafter, consider whether this theorem is true under this definition, where the closed smooth curve is formed by convex and concave curves linked alternatively. (2) Reaffirm the upper bond of $r$ proposed, i.e. $r=\rho$ , where $\rho$ is the radius of the curvature, to avoid self-intersection. (3) What is the least identity of the curves in order for this theorem to be true?
This is similar to the first part of question (1). (4) Can this proof be more generalised? For example, what if this theorem is extended into higher dimensions? (Is there any analogy in higher dimensions?) Also, I would like to bring your attention towards some of the newly posted answers. Meanwhile, any alternative approach or proof is encouraged. Please do not hesitate in providing any insights or comments in further progressing this question.","['geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

$$M_N(1)=M_{N-1}(1)=0,\ \frac{d M_{N}}{d x}(0)=h,\ \frac{d M_{N-1}}{d x}(0)=0$$ The solution to $M_N$ is:
$$M_N(x)=\frac{h}{\lambda_N}\text{sech}(\lambda_N)\sinh(\lambda_N(x-1))$$

The trouble comes when I solve $M_{N-1}$. I get:
$$M_{N-1}=\frac{fh}{d_{N-1}\lambda_{N}^2}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_N}\text{sech}(\lambda_N)\sinh(\lambda_N(x-1))-\frac{1}{\lambda_{N-1}}\text{sech}(\lambda_{N-1})\sinh(\lambda_{N-1}(x-1))\right)$$

1402679,Proving that all integers are even or odd [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Proving that an integer is even if and only if it is not odd (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I know that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a group under addition with a multiplication defined. I have just the definition of even and odd integers: $n$ is even if $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$ and $n$ is odd if $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Using just this I am wondering how to prove that all integers are either even or odd. That is, how can I prove that given an integer $n$, $n$ must be even or odd? My problem with this is that it seems so simple. I know that one can divide an integer by $2$ and the remainder will be $0$ or $1$. Using this, it is clear that the even and odd integers make up everything. But how can I prove it without using this fact about remainders and such? I guess one could also use facts about prime numbers, but I am looking for a proof that just uses the definition of odd and even.","['abstract-algebra', 'parity', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1402715,What should we understand from the definition of orthogonality in inner product spaces other than $\mathbb R^n$?,"In the beginning of linear algebra courses, there are vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ and the dot product is introduced. We learn that if the dot product of two vectors is zero, then these vectors are called orthogonal and there is a right angle between them. Therefore, we understand perpendicularity from the definition of orthogonality. In the last chapters, all previous notions are generalized as vector spaces and inner products are introduced. Then we learn vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are orthogonal if $\langle \vec u, \vec v \rangle=0$ in inner product spaces. Our previous knowledge guides us to seek a right angle between them. Let $P$ be the vector space of first degree polynomials. Let $p(x)=ax+b$ and $q(x)=cx+d$. Define $\langle p(x), q(x) \rangle$ as $$\langle p(x), q(x) \rangle=ac+bd$$ Then if we consider $p(x)=x-2$ and $q(x)=4x+2$, we find that $\langle p(x), q(x) \rangle=0$. But if we draw them, we see that there is $30.96$ degrees between them. So orthogonality in inner product spaces does not necessarily mean perpendicularity.

1402884,Bingo probability of a tie with 20 players,"Assume ""standard"" bingo (75 numbers) with the columns ranging the following inclusive ""semi-random"" values B: 1 to 15, I: 16 to 30, N: 31 to 45, G: 46 to 60, O: 61 to 75. By semi-random I mean restricted to a small range (15 at a time).  There is a free space in the middle of the 5x5 playing board.  Numbers (from 1 to 75 inclusive) are randomly drawn one a time without replacement (without any repeats in each game) and with equal probability of being drawn.  A win (Bingo) is defined as a completed line segment of 5 adjacent squares made only from the drawn numbers but which may include the free space (and must include it if it is beneficial).  A bingo card has 25 of these board squares arranged in a 5x5 matrix. So my question is if there are 20 players, each with a unique playing card (randomly generated by computer out of I think 552 septillion possible playing cards), what are the chances/probability that 2 or more players will get Bingo on the same drawn number?.  For example, someone could win bingo with as few as 4 drawn numbers but likely it would take much more.  So I am asking if balls are drawn until at least one person wins, what are the chances that at least 2 people will win at the same time?  The game is considered finished / decided when there is at least 1 winner for that game.  You can assume that all players are good enough not to make any mistakes (not true in real bingo but assume here). I am not sure how to set this up mathematically and because there are so many possible bingo cards, computer simulation of all of them is not a good idea.  Perhaps what can be done with simulation is to first simulate 20 legitimate bingo cards (out of 552 septillion), and then have the computer draw one random number at a time until we have at least 1 winner.  Do this for maybe 1 million trials and count how many have simultaneous multiwinners.  For example, after 11 balls drawn there are no winners yet for that game but on the 12 drawn ball, there are 2 or more winners.  I would like to know how often the multiwinner situation occurs. I could probably do the simulation with a fair amount of work but wanted to know if this problem can be done mathematically or if is too difficult to set up. One concern I see is that if one card has for its first column (the B column), from top to bottom, 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15 and some other card has for column B (also from top to bottom), 15, 10, 7, 4, and 1 in that order.  Problem there is even though the cards have different order for the B column numbers, if those 5 numbers are drawn, both players may win at the same time.  So my point is it makes a difference if we say (or not) that multiple bingo cards cannot have the same exact 5 numbers in a row, column, or diagonal but just in a different order.  That might be an interesting problem in itself to figure out how many fewer ""legit"" bingo cards there are with that constraint so someone could comment about it but the actual question is about the multiwinner probability.  I think the answer to the no permutation bingo card restriction is about 111 quadrillion legit bingo cards.",['probability']

A function is just a set of ordered pairs (with some conditions). Two sets are equal if they have the same elements (the Axiom of Extensionality). With this assumption, one can prove the above definition. However, the proof does not require that the ranges of $f$ and $g$ have to be the same. Suppose that the ranges are different, let's say $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ defined by $g(x)=x$. If we consider these functions as sets of ordered pairs, then they are just the set $\lbrace (x,x):x\in\mathbb{R}\rbrace$. Thus they are equal by the Axiom of Extensionality. However, the equality also requires that if objects $a$ and $b$ are equal, then any property which is true for $a$ is also true for $b$. In this case, we know that $f$ is a surjective, but $g$ isn't. Thus $f$ should not be equal to $g$ and hence a contradiction. But this is not a proof by contradiction to show that the ranges must be equal, everything assumed here is just axioms of ZFC and what is equality itself. So it looks like it is inconsistent. I have searched similar questions in this website, but there is no question or answer that relate to this. The most related answer would be $f$ and $g$ must have the same range so there would be no problem. But logically, this is just an additional assumption to restrict the ability to compare two functions. If they don't have the same range, then you can't compare it, or there will be a paradox. The problem for this answer is, it doesn't solve the above paradox. It just restricts itself to the situation that the paradox won't arise, but the inconsistency is still there. Lastly, I found another way to solve this problem in a set theory book. In the book, when one considers surjection, one have to specify which set the surjection is over. For example, one has to say whether it's surjection over $\mathbb{R}$ or surjection over $\mathbb{C}$. In this case, the paradox won't arise because $f$ and $g$ are both surjective over $\mathbb{R}$ and not surjective over $\mathbb{C}$. Thus the surjective property are the same for $f$ and $g$. The only problem for this answer is, if one consider the property of 'surjection over its range' instead, then this property is true for $f$ but not for $g$, which implies that $f\neq g$ again. When do two functions become equal in general? Can anyone clarify this for me? Thank you in advance.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

$$\Delta u(x) =-c(x)u(x)$$
 Then, I am supposed to show that $u(x)=0$ for all $x \in \overline{U}.$ Now, I have figured out a proof, but I don't need the connectedness. This makes me suspicious, so please could anybody check my proof: Let $G:=\{x \in U; u(x) > 0\}.$ Then we have $\Delta u(x) =-c(x)u(x) \ge 0$ on $G.$ Thus, $u$ is subharmonic on $G$ and $G$ is open (as the preimage of an open interval) and bounded as $U$ is bounded. Thus, we can apply the maximum principle for subharmonic functions and get $$\max_{\overline{G}} u =  \max_{\partial G}u.$$ We show that $u$ is zero on $\partial G.$ If $x \in \partial G \cap \partial U$ then $u$ is zero by assumption in the theorem. If $x \in \partial G \backslash \partial U$ then $\,x \in \operatorname{int}\left(U\right).\,$ Thus, we have, as $\,x \notin G$ that $u(x) \le 0.\,$ But by continuity we must have $u(x)=0.$ Thus, $u$ is zero on $\partial G.$ Hence, we get that $u$ must be zero in $\overline{G}.$ Now, we can apply the same argument to $-u$ in order to see that $u$ is actually zero everywhere.

Start with the idea of differentiating vector fields in Euclidean space: choose a fixed orthonormal basis $\{e_1,\cdots,e_n\}$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$, then any vector field $X$ can be written in the form $\sum_{i=1}^n X^i e_i$ for some smooth function.  $X^1,\cdots,X^n$. Then the derivative of $X$ in the direction of a vector $v$ is given by $D_v X=\sum_{i=1}^n v(X^i)e_i$. Essentially, we just  differentiate the coeffient functions. The key is to think of vectors $\{e_1,\cdots,e_n\}$ as being constant. However, on a manifold, this no longer holds: There are no natural vector field which we can take to be `constant'.

1403727,Volume forms and volume of a smooth manifold,"Choose a volume form $\omega$ on $M$, oriented manifold. For every $F\in C^{\infty}_c(M)$, we define
$$
\int_M F:=\int_M F\omega
$$
where in the right hand term $M$ is taken wit positive orientation w.r.t. $\omega$, that is
$$
\omega=\lambda_p dx_1\wedge\dots\wedge dx_n
$$
for every $p$, and $\lambda_p>0$. Let $M$ be a $n$-dimensional compact manifold and let $\omega\in\Omega^n(M)$ be a volume form. Define the volume of M as
$$
Vol(M):=\int_M 1=\int_M\omega
$$ Now I'm asking myself if the Volume is well-defined, i.e. if it doesn't depend on the choice of $\omega$. I would say that it depends on the choice of $\omega$. Infact, I know that $\omega$ would be, locally, something of the kind
$$
(\omega)_p=F_p(dx_1\wedge\dots\wedge dx_n)_p
$$
where $x_1,\dots,x_n$ are the coordinates induced by a local chart and $F\in C^{\infty}(M)$. So $\omega$ is not unique. Probably I haven't learnt well this topic. Remember that a volume form for a $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is a line section of the canonical bundle $\Lambda^nT^*M$, i.e. a non-vanishing $n$-form. How can I prove that the volume of a compact manifold always positive?","['volume', 'differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-forms']"

1403777,Tangent vectors and parametric curves,"Consider the curve $C$ defined by $(x,y,z) = \bar{r}(t)$, where $$\bar{r}(t)=\langle t\sin t, t\cos t, t^2 \rangle~~; t \in \mathbb{R}^3$$ Show that $C$ lies on the paraboloid $z= x^2 + y^2$ Find a vector tangent to $C$ at the point $\bar{r}(1)$. Find the parametric equation for the line tangent to the curve $\bar{r}$ at the point $(0,-\pi, \pi^2)$. My attempt: Consider the paraboloid $z = x^2 + y^2$. Let \begin{align}x=t\sin t \\ y = t\cos t\end{align} Then notice that \begin{align}z &= t^2\sin^2 t + t^2\cos^2t \\ &=t^2(\sin^2t + \cos^2t) \\ &= t^2\end{align} Thus $C$ lies on the paraboloid $z = x^2 + y^2$. $\bar{r}'(t) = \langle\sin t + t\cos t, \cos t - t\sin t, 2t \rangle$ Thus, when $t=1$, the tangent vector must be $$\bar{r}'(1) = \langle\sin (1) + \cos(1), \cos(1) - \sin (1), 2 \rangle$$ Notice that at the point $(0,-\pi, \pi^2)$ we have that $t = \pi$. Thus the parametric equation of the line tangent to $\bar{r}$ a the point $(0,-\pi, \pi^2)$ is given by \begin{align}\bar{l}(t) &= r(\pi) + (t - \pi)\bar{r}'(\pi) \\ &= \langle -\pi t + \pi^2, -t, 2\pi t - \pi^2 \rangle\end{align} Are these correct?

1403808,"Given: self-adjoint, monotonic increasing sequence in $L(H)$ such that $\|T_n\|<C$. Why converges $(T_n)$ strongly to a self-adjoint $T\in L(H)$?","Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $(T_n)\subseteq L(H)$ a sequence such that $T_n^\ast=T_n$ and $T_n\le T_{n+1}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. There exists a constant $C>0$ such that $\|T_n\|<C$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The claim is: then there exists a $T\in L(H)$ such that $T=T^*$ and such that $T_n\to T$ strong, $n\to\infty$. I stuck a little bit. My try: Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. $T_n$ self-adjoint implies, that $\langle T_nx,x\rangle\in\mathbb{R}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{R}$, $x\in H$. So, the sequence $(\langle T_nx,x\rangle )$ is a real sequence which is monotonic increasing, because $\langle T_nx,x\rangle\le \langle T_{n+1}x,x\rangle$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and the sequence is bounded, because $|\langle T_nx,x\rangle |\le \|T_nx\|\|x\|\le C\|x\|^2$ for all $x\in H$. Therefore $(\langle T_nx,x\rangle )$ is convergent in $\mathbb{R}$. Now, how to continue? The next step I made is to prove that $(\langle T_nx,y\rangle )$ is convergent for all $x,y\in H$ with the polarization identity, but I did it wrong.. Could anybody help me to prove this, that $(\langle T_nx,y\rangle )$ is convergent for all $x,y\in H$ in $\mathbb{R}$? What I did next, if we know that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\langle T_nx,y\rangle =:F(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}$ exists: It is $|F(x,y)|=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}|\langle T_nx,y\rangle|\le C\|x\|\|y\|$ for all $x,y\in H$, therefore $$F_x:H\to\mathbb{C},\; y\mapsto \overline{F(x,y)}$$is a linear, bounded functional. The Riesz-Representationtheorem gives us, that there exists $Tx\in H$ such that $F_x(y)=\langle y,Tx\rangle=\overline{F(x,y)}$. If you conjugate both sides, we obtain $F(x,y)=\langle Tx,y\rangle$ for all $x,y\in H$. Then I proved that $T$ is linear and bounded and that $T$ is self-adjoint, there was no problem. But how to prove $\|T_nx-Tx\|\to 0$ for all $x\in H$, $n\to\infty$? But if you know an other proof, let me know it. I hope I did no mistakes. Regards Edit: My try with the polarization identity $\langle x,y\rangle =\frac{1}{4}(\|x+y\|^2-\|x-y\|^2+i\|x+iy\|^2-i\|x-iy\|^2)$ for $x,y$ of a complex Hilbert space $H$: 
$\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, $x,y\in H$, it is : $\langle T_nx,y\rangle =\frac{1}{4}(\|T_nx+y\|^2-\|T_nx-y\|^2)+\frac{i}{4}(\|T_nx+iy\|^2-\|T_nx-iy\|^2)=\frac{1}{4}(\langle T_nx+y,T_nx+y\rangle-\langle T_nx-y,T_nx-y\rangle)+\frac{i}{4}(\langle T_nx+iy,T_nx+iy\rangle-\langle T_nx-iy,T_nx-iy\rangle)$. Can I argue now, that all the summands converge, because $(\langle T_nx,x\rangle )$ converges for all $x\in H$?",['functional-analysis']

1403823,What happens to tangential gradient when flattening a surface,"The tangential gradient $\nabla_\tau f$ associated to a surface $S$ is defined as the projection of a suitable extension $\nabla f$ to the tangent plane to that surface. It seems reasonable to think that when changing coordinates  in order to flatten the surface, the tangential gradient is somehow related to the actual gradient. Having no experience with this notion, I cannot imagine precisely what happens when making such a transformation. Suppose that the surface $S$ is parametrized by $x(s,t)$ where $s,t$ lie in a plane region $T$. We know the surface integral formula
$$ \iint_S fdS = \iint_T f(x(s,t)) \left \| \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} \times \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\right\|dsdt. $$
I am interested in what happens when we have to integrate a function depending on the tangential gradient, i.e. I would like to see a formula for 
$$ \iint_S |\nabla_\tau f|^2 dS = ... $$
My guess is that we'll have a gradient term and a Jacobian factor, but I don't have a precise idea on how to find the formula or prove its corectedness. The questions are: What is the completion of the above formula? Do you have any useful references treating this kind of integrals?
