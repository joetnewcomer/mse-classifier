856654,Why absolute values of Jacobians in change of variables for multiple integrals but not single integrals?,"If $g:[a,b]\to\mathbf R$ is a change of 1D coordinates, then the formula is:
$$ \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}\,f(x)\,dx = \int_a^b\,f(g(t))\frac{dx}{dt}\,dt. 
\qquad\text{(1)}$$ If  $T=\{x=f(u,v); y=g(u,v)\}$ is a change of 2D coordinates, then the formula is:
$$\iint_{T(R)}\,\phi(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \iint_R\,\phi(f(u,v),g(u,v)) \left| 
\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)} \right|\,du\,dv \qquad\text{(2a)}$$ It seems that the formula for 2D (and higher dimensions) are extensions of the 1D version.   If so, then the 1D version 'should' also require absolute value.  Can anyone explain why, except for 1D, do all higher versions require the absolute value of Jacobians? Does it have something to do with the way we specify the lower and upper limits of the 1D integral? If so, can anyone elaborate it further? ===== Below were added after this question was flagged as a duplicated ====== This question was flagged as duplicated. But it seems to me that this question has a very clear objective: absolute value for higher dimension, but why not 1D?  This question is not about any particular example, it is more about the way the theorem is stated in 1D and higher dimension.  Specifically, it is more about the challenge of a  practical and clerk-like notation of specifying an orientation of a 2D region in double integral. As elaborated by StrangerLoop and Hurkyl, 1D region such as an interval can be flipped naively just by noting the magnitudes of the endpoints. We can indicate the 'orientation' in a practical and clerk-like manner (as the limits). For double integrals we need to know which side of the region is the 'right' side.  As a follow up,  I have the following comment: There is no universal practical and clerk-like way to specify a 2D region. How to specify an oriented region $T(R)$ in a generic manner so that one always mechanically compute a stand-alone double integral correctly, including the sign. I assume that if we can do that, then it is possible to generalize the 1D version to 2D without the 'artificial' need of absolute value.  Because each double integral, as a stand-alone integral, on either side of (2b) will be correctly signed. $$\iint_{T(R)}\,\phi(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \iint_R\,\phi(f(u,v),g(u,v))  
\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)} \,du\,dv \qquad\text{(2b)} $$ Thanks for the two answers. They are helpful in helping me understand the ""why"" part.  Any further comment on my observation is appreciated.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'integration']"
856663,Important applications of the Uniform Boundedness Principle,"There's like three applications of the uniform boundedness principle in wikipedia: 1) If a sequence of bounded operators converges pointwise to an operator, then the limit operator is also bounded, and the convergence is uniform on compact sets. 2) Any weakly bounded subset of a normed space is bounded. 3) A result in pointwise convergence of Fourier series.

856675,Find the power series of $x\ln(1-x)$.,"So the exercise I had to do was: Find the power representation of $x\ln(1-x)$. The way to go was finding the power series representation of $\ln(1-x)$ and then multiply it with $x$. But why can't you first find the derative of $x\ln(1-x)$ which is $x/(1-x) + \ln(1-x)$ and then make power series of them both. And then find the antiderative of that. Because when they ask to find power series representation of $\ln(1-x)$ you have to first find derivative of this then convert it into series and then find antiderivative of this series. So why can't i do the same with $x\ln(1-x)$..?
So why can't I apply the same method? Why can't I solve this exercise in same way, by first finding the derivative then turning it into a power series and then integrating it? I did $f(x)= x\ln (1-x)$ $f^\prime(x) = -x/(1-x) + \ln(1-x)$ I already knew $\ln(1-x)= Σ-(1/n) x^{n+1}$ (with n=0) This in power series gives
$-x\sum x^n + \sum -1/n x^{n+1}$ (both n=0) This gives $\sum-x^{n+1} + \sum-(1/n) x^{n+1}$
Now I integrate both and get
$\sum-(1/(n+2)) \cdot x^{n+2} + \sum-1/n \cdot 1/(n+2) x^{n+2} $","['power-series', 'calculus']"

856702,"If $w$ is in weak $A_{\infty}(d\mu)$ where $d\mu$ is a doubling measure, then is $w\,d\mu$ doubling?","Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let it be doubling i.e. there exists a a constant $C>1$ such that $\mu(B(x_0, 2r)) \leq C \mu(B(x_0,r))$ for all balls $B(x_0,r)$. Let $w$ be a weight with respect to $\mu$ i.e. $w\in L^1_\text{loc}(\mathbb{R^n}, d\mu)$ and $w>0$ $\mu$ a.e. Consider the measure $w\,d\mu$ and let $$w(A) = \int_A w\,d\mu $$ for any measurable set $A$. Suppose there exists constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ with $0<\alpha, \beta <1$ such that whenever $E\subset B$ is a measurable subset of the ball $B$ and satisfies $$ \frac{\mu(E)}{\mu(B)} >\alpha  \quad \text{ then} \quad \frac{w(E)}{w(B)} > \beta$$ Question: Is the measure $wd\mu$ doubling? i.e. does there a constant $C>1$ such that $w(B(x_0,2r))\leq Cw(B(x_0,r))$ for all balls $B(x_0,r)$? $$ $$ Background: This is the characterization of weak $A_\infty$ weights of $d\mu$. The thing is that if $\mu$ is the lebesgue measure then there is no problem. However for general doubling measures $\mu$, this looks tricky to me as we have no control over the value of $\alpha$ (Note in particular that $\mu(B)/\mu(2B)$ can be quite small as compared to $\alpha$, which makes the given property difficult to use). Stein in his Harmonic analysis only has $\mu$ as the lebesgue measure and Journe in book on Calderon Zygmund Operators, says this is obvious but I am skeptical. The best that I could do was that $w$ has to satisfy a reverse holder inequality (just adapting the proof in Stein), but still with this I don't know how to prove doubling.","['measure-theory', 'harmonic-analysis']"
856703,Newly Developed With Details - Describing orthographic projection using simple 2D transformations,"Thanks to Pedro for helping me further develop my question into something tangible. His (most recent) answer below clearly and formally outlines what I am asking. This is similar to this question, except in 3D and involving surfaces. I am doing some graphics work involving rotation matrices. The problem is that I am not just transforming points, I'm also transforming arbitrary surfaces (images, colors, etc.) These surfaces are represented by rectangles and only really support two main transformations, rotation and scaling (along the horizontal and vertical axes). If I have a rotation matrix:
$$
    M = \left(\begin{matrix}
        m_0 & m_1 & m_2 \\
        m_3 & m_4 & m_5 \\
        m_6 & m_7 & m_8 \\
        \end{matrix}\right)
$$ That might produce some rotation like this: (just for illustration purposes) It could be said that in order to achieve this shape, a rectangle would go through a certain counter-clockwise rotation and then a certain scaling along the horizontal axis and the vertical axis. Is there any way to figure out what that counter-clockwise angle is and what the scale factors are? Keep in mind that I said that the rotation occurs first, though this is arbitrary and the rotation and scale transformations could happen in any order. EDIT: Hopefully these details grant more clarity. Here's exactly what's happening. There is a set of points (a, b, 0) that represent 3D coordinates. Each of these points have a related surface represented by a width and height. That surface could be an image, a color or any other shape potentially. These surfaces support two main transformations: rotation and scale transformations. The scale transformations occur in the horizontal and vertical axis and the rotations occur around an axis perpendicular to the screen. Assume the plane of the screen is the reference point from which all rotations occur. Also assume that there is a matrix M as defined above that represents the orientation of the 3D coordinate plane on which (a, b, 0) resides. What I am trying to do is project the point (a, b, 0) AND its related surface onto the screen using the aforementioned matrix. Taking that point (a, b, 0), as well as an orientation matrix in as input, I would like to figure out how I should transform the surface so that it appears as it would in 3D on the 2D screen (i.e. how I can transform it so that it looks projected on the screen). The image above is a good example of a surface that while looking 3D, is actually somehow represented by a set of 2D points. I would like to know how to come up with that projection given that I do not have the full point array. My assumption, which I now see may be incorrect, was that you could do that with a rotation and a scale alone. An answer below demonstrated that in fact you need at least another angle called the shear angle. Another piece of information that may be useful: As I mentioned, this is graphics work, so the coordinate axis are actually flipped. The x-axis is the same, but the y-axis is flipped so it becomes more positive as you go down. Hopefully making my question a bit more broad will lead to an answer: What transformations do I need to project a flat 3D surface onto a 2D plane (the screen)?",['matrices']
856717,Existence of a sequence of continuous functions converging pointwise to a characteristic function.,"I'm reading Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis and in section 5.11 he makes the next assertion: Put $g_n(t)=1$ if $D_n(t)\geq 0$, $g(t)=-1$ if $D_n(t)<0$. There exist $f_j\in C(T)$ such that $-1\leq f_j\leq 1$ and $f_j(t)\to g(t)$ for every $t$, as $j\to \infty$. Here, $C(T)$ denotes the set of continuous functions on  the unit circle $T=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$ and for $t\in T$, $D_n(t)=\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikt}$. I know that by Lusin's theorem, we can find a sequence of continuous functions converging a.e. to $g$ with $|f_j|\leq 1$ for every function $f_j$ in the sequence, but I don't why he claims that we can find a sequence converging for every point. Could you help me to clarify this? I think it suffices to show this for a characteristic function of a closed set since $g=\chi_F-\chi_{T\setminus F}$ where $F=D_n^{-1}([0,\infty))$ but I don't know how to prove this.

If we denote $F(x)=\frac16x^3\left(xf'(x)\right)'''$ then $F(x)=\sum_{k=0}^nk\binom{k}{3}\binom{2n}{k}x^k$, so the desired sum is $F(1)$.

Second thing I tried was to take $g(x)=(1+x)^{2n}$ and then denote $G(x)=\frac16x^3\left(xg'(x)\right)'''$. Then $G(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{2n}k\binom{k}{3}\binom{2n}{k}x^k$. So, if we look at 
$$h(x)=G(x)\frac1{1-x}=\sum_{j=0}^\infty\left(\sum_{k=0}^jk\binom{k}{3}\binom{2n}{k}\right)x^j$$
So the desired sum will be the coefficient of $x^n$. But here it doesn't work either, as $$h(x)=\binom{2n}{3}(2nx+3)\frac{(1+x)^{2n-4}}{1-x}$$

It's impossible for any shape to not have gaps if they can't overlap. In a previous part of the exercise I already found the cardinality of $O$ to be (at most) $\aleph_0$ by finding a rational point $(q_1,q_2)$ in each disk of $O: q_1,q_2\in \mathbb Q\times\mathbb Q$ .

857073,Formula for adjusting font height,"INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT INFORMATION: I am a software developer that needs to implement printing in my application. In my application user can choose different paper sizes ( A3, A4, A5 ...) which requires from my application to scale drawing accordingly. I have managed to solve most of the tasks except adjusting the font height. This is the place where I got stuck. I have asked for help in StackOveflow but got no satisfying answer. Since all I need is formula for scaling font height, I have decided to ask for help here. Since this is mathematical site, I will phrase my question in a way that does not require any programming knowledge ( all I ask for is to carefully read the question, since this will be hard for me ). If I need to clarify something or add more info please leave a comment and I will update my post. PROBLEM: I have coordinates of the rectangle in which text should be drawn. Unfortunately, I must pick random value for font before drawing the text inside ( there is no way around it ), instead of calculating proper font size. All I can do now is to calculate the rectangle this text ( with this font height ) will fit in. Below image shows what I mean: I have font height of the text in proposed rectangle; I have (x,y) coordinates of both rectangles ( since my English is unable to precisely describe what I mean please see image below ): IMPORTANT NOTE: In my programming framework, y-axis is reversed -> positive values are below x-axis and negative ones above. Please see below picture: QUESTION: Can you give me the formula for properly changing  current font height so the text can fit into target rectangle? EDIT: I have tried to apply formula recommended by member Nikos M. and got very decent results. The earlier problem why his formula malfunctioned was related to the way my programming language performed conversion between integer and real numbers. After correcting this, the output is nearly perfect ( the last letter barely exceeds the limit ). I will keep trying with this approach since it looks very promising, but would welcome other solutions if there are any. END OF EDIT EDIT #2: I have altered the formula from member MvG 's answer to this: $$\text{optimal font size}=\text{guessed font size}\times\sqrt{\frac
{\text{desired width}}{\text{computed width}}}$$ There was only one case where text exceeded the limit, in all other cases the behavior was perfect. END OF EDIT #2 Again, this is my fisrt post so if edit is required/adding of proper tags/anything leave me a comment and I will react accordingly as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and understanding. FINAL REMARKS: I have tried everything but the accepted solution always failed in one or two cases. No matter how much answerer tried, each time failure would happen. I believe that the problem doesn't lie in mathematical part, but is rather related to a faulty API I use. I have consulted experienced engineers and they agreed. Therefore I have officially accepted the answer, since from the mathematical standpoint it does solve the problem. This section is written to warn programers to become misguided that the formula actually solves programming part of the problem too. Thank you everyone for trying to help and for your support.

857098,Complex measures vs. Positive Measures,"In his real and complex analysis, Rudin writes that the right hand side of the expression $\mu(E) = \Sigma \mu(E_i)$ must necessarily converge for any countable partition $\{E_i\}$ of a measurable E, with respect to any complex measure.

I've found that a hysteresis loop can be described analytically using parametric equations, however performing contour integration has not bee successful. I’ve been working with a system that exhibits hysteresis and I’ve found that the more common models do not work for me.  I am wondering if anyone is aware of other models that might be out there for hysteresis.  Thus far, I’ve tried the Preisach model and Jiles-Atherton model, neither of which allow me to simulate the types of loops that I work with. I’ve gone the the Physics, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Mathematica, and some other StackExchange communities, but haven’t found anything beyond Preisach or Jiles-Atherton being mentioned as potential approaches to modeling/simulating hysteresis.  I found some information on the VINCH model, the Bouc–Wen model, and the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model, but none of them fit what I am trying to model.  This model really needs to be analytical rather than computational.  Some of the models use functions like sign[x] , and so forth, that aren't going to work for my system. I’ve been messing with the idea of using a parametric approach, that is to say, having both quantities that are shown in the hysteresis plot (for instance, M and H for ferromagnetism, or D and E for ferroelectricity, etc.), both being dependent on some other variable. I’ve found one paper that analytically handles this type of model by Lapshin, R.V., Analytical Model for the Approximation of Hysteresis Loop and Its Application to the Scanning Tunneling Microscope. Review of Scientific Instruments , 1995. 66(9): p. 4718-4730 (DOI: 10.1063/1.1145314 ). The model shows some interesting results, however the hysteresis loops that I am trying to model are more complex than those in the publication. Actually, I am considering trying to use a superposition of solutions to try and construct a solution appropriate for my system.  However, my attempts have yet to work. What I am trying to model is the following: a system in hysteresis that allows for both linear and non-linear ""slopes"", as well as linear and non-linear phase lags. Here are the pieces that you see in the graph above: (1)  A linear (reversible), in-phase component, same slope over the entire range (BLUE) (2)  A linear (irreversible), out-of-phase component (RED) (3)  A non-linear (reversible), in-phase component, one slope near origin, saturates far from origin (MAGENTA) (4)  A non-linear (irreversible), out-of-phase component (GREEN) If this was a circuit model, and were plotting charge vs. voltage (q vs V), while driving the circuit sinusoidally, (1) would be simple linear resistor, (2) would be a linear capacitor, (3) would be a non-linear resistor (perhaps one that saturates above a certain voltage, but not a memristor), and (4) would be a non-linear capacitive element that is bistable with very constant remanence and coercivity, not sure what it would be called though, perhaps an ""ideal hysteron"". If you add these four components together, you can get something resembling a proper hysteresis loop: Notice that the hysteresis loop can also be rotated in phase space. Has anyone seen a model that would allow this?  Also, is there some way to correlate these components to real physical properties for a hysteresis loop?

First of all, I know that $z^3+z^2-z-1 = (z+1)^2(z-1)$. I split up the integral as a sum of residues:
$$
I \ = \ 
2\pi i \cdot Res_{z=-1}\frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2\cdot(z-1)}
\ + 2 \pi i \cdot Res_{z=1}\frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2\cdot(z-1)}
$$
The rightmost part becomes $2 \pi \cdot 1^3/(1+1)^2 \ = \ \pi i /2$. The same trick can't be applied for the the other part. There was another lemma that was useful though:
$$
Res_{z=1}f(x) \ = \  \frac{1}{(2-1)!} \cdot 
\lim_{z \rightarrow -1}\left( (z+1)^2 \cdot \frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2(z-1)}\right)
\ = \ \frac{1}{(1+1)^2} \ = \ \frac{1}{4}

Now I should multiply this by $2 \pi i$, which gives me $\pi \cdot i /2$.
Adding gives us $\pi i $.

Is the same true if $N,M$ are smooth manifolds with boundary and $N$ is a neat submanifold of $M$? For the proof, in most texts I found the idea to map $(n,x)\in N\times\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\varphi(1)$ for a geodesics $\varphi$ starting in $n$ with tangent vector $\epsilon x$ for $\epsilon$ small enough. This probably doesn't work on the boundary: for example, if $M$ is the closed unit 2-disc and $N:=\{0\}\times [-1,1]$ with the horizontal framing $(1,0)$ then I don't see how to generalize the above construction. I can hardly have a geodesics in $M$ starting in $(0,1)$ in the $(1,0)$ direction.

Let $M = |y-z|$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Let $U(f,P)$ denote the upper sum and $L(f,P)$ the lower sum for partition $P$.

This is true because $f$ and $\widetilde{f}$ only differ at $x$ and at $x$ they can maximally differ by $M$. Since the partition $Q$ contains the interval $(x- {\varepsilon \over 2M}, x + {\varepsilon \over 2M})$ and this interval has lenght ${\varepsilon \over M}$ the maximal difference of these sums can be only $\varepsilon$. Similarly, $|L(f,Q)-L(\widetilde{f},Q)| \le \varepsilon$.

\frac{u}{e^{-v}} (f_{uu}'' e^{-2v}) + -f_u' e^{-v} - f_{uu}''ue^{-v} + f_{uv}''e^{-v} + f_u'e^{-v} = xe^{-2y}
$$
$f_u' e^{-v}$ and $uf_{uu}''e^{-v}$ cancels and I get
$$
f_{uv}'' = ue^{-v} = \frac{\partial ^2f}{\partial u \,\partial v}
$$ Obviously I've missed something. The terms with $f_{uu}''$ is gonna cancel out each other, but I can't figure out whats wrong. I've recalculated this assignment 3 times and it must be something Im not doing correctly, since I probably wouldnt do the same error three times in a row.. The answer is supposed to be:
$$
\frac{\partial ^2f}{\partial u \,\partial v} = u
$$ So I'm missing a $v$ in the first term and $e^{-v}$ multiplied with $f_{uv}''$","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-differential-equations']"

858078,The only fixed-point free automorphism of order $2$ is $\phi(a)=a^{-1}$(in a finite group),"I got the problem in  Dummit and Foote's Algebra book to prove if $G$ is a finite group that has an automorphism $\phi$  in which if $a=\phi(a)$ then $a=1$. And which satisfies $\phi(\phi(a))=a$ for all $a$ then $G$ is abelian. Here is what I did: I first prove the map $\omega(a)=a^{-1}\phi(a)$ is injective(and since the group is finite and the domain is the same as the co-domain this proves it is also bijective): $a^{-1}\phi(a)=b^{-1}\phi(b)\implies ba^{-1}\phi(a)=\phi(b)\implies ba^{-1}=\phi(b)\phi(a)^{-1}=\phi(ba^{-1})\implies ba^{-1}=1\implies b=a$. So every element in $G$ is of the form $a^{-1}\phi(a)$. Notice $\phi(a^{-1}\phi(a))=\phi(a^{-1})a$. Which is the inverse of $a^{-1}\phi(a)$ which tells us $\phi(g)=g^{-1}$. From here we get $\phi(ab)=b^{-1}a^{-1}=a^{-1}b^{-1}=\phi(a) \phi(b)$ multiplying by $a$ and $b$ on both sides gives $ab=ba$ as desired. My question is: is what I did correct (especially everything up to the point where I conclude $\phi(a)=a^{-1}$)? Normally I wouldn't ask this, but the fact that it asked me to prove something much weaker instead of characterizing the automorphism uniquely makes me doubt it is OK.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

$$
\int_C {e^{3z}-z\over (z+1)^2z^2}
$$
where $C$ is a circle with the center at the origin and radius ${1 \over 2}$. My approach was to separate the integral as a differentiation of 2 contour integrals: $$
\int_C {e^{3z}-z\over (z+1)^2z^2} = \int_C {e^{3z}\over (z+1)^2z^2} - \int_C {1\over (z+1)^2z}
$$ Then I calculated the residue of each contour integral with a Laurent series around $z_0 = 0$: $$
{e^{3z}\over (z+1)^2z^2} = {1\over (z+1^2)}\ .\ e^{3z}\ .\ {1\over z}
$$ $$
{e^{3z}\over (z+1)^2z^2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {3^nz^{n-2}\over n!}\ .\ (1-2z+3z^2+...)
$$ $$
{e^{3z}\over (z+1)^2z^2} = {a_{-2}\over z^2}+{-2+3\over z}+a_0+...
$$ So the residue for this contour integral is $1$ and the final result is $2\pi i$ I did the same with the other countour integral: $$
{1\over (z+1)^2z} = {1\over z}\ .\ (1-2z+3z^2+...)
$$ $$
{1\over (z+1)^2z} = {1\over z}-2+3z^2+...
$$ So the residue for this contour integral is also $1$ and the final result is $2\pi i$ Then I substitute my results in the original contour integral: $$
\int_C {e^{3z}-z\over (z+1)^2z^2} = 2\pi i - 2\pi i

858224,Non-examples for the Kato-Rellich Theorem,"The Kato-Rellich Theorem is a classical result stating that if $A,B$ are unbounded operators on a Hilbert space with $A$ self-adjoint, $B$ symmetric, $\mathcal D (A)\subset \mathcal D(B)$ and
$$
\|Bx\|\leq a\|A x\|+b\|x\|,\;\;x\in\mathcal D(A)
$$
for positive constants $a,b$, with $a<1$, then $A+B$ is self-adjoint on the domain of $A$. The infimum of those $a$ for which the above inequality holds is called the relative bound of $B$. Thus, $A+B$ is self-adjoint if $B$ is relatively bounded with bound $a<1$. I'm interested in non-examples where $A+B$ is not essentially self-adjoint even though $A$ is self-adjoint, $B$ is symmetric and $\mathcal D(A)\subset\mathcal D(B)$. I have tried considering multiplication operators to no avail. Let $M_\phi$ denote the multiplication operator
$$
M_\phi h=\phi h,\;\;\mathcal D(M_{\phi})=\{ h|\phi h\in L_2\},
$$
and let $A=M_f$, $B=M_g$ with $f,g$ real functions, finite almost everywhere. Since $A$ and $B$ are closed, the assumption $\mathcal D(A)\subset\mathcal D(B)$ implies the bound
$$
\|B h\|\leq C(\|A h\| +\|h\|)
$$
for some $C>0$. But then, for $h$ non-zero only on the set $\{x||f(x)|\leq M\}$, one obtains
$$
\|B  h\|\leq C(1+M)\|h\|,
$$
which implies that $|g(x)|\leq C(1+M)$ almost everywhere on $\{x||f(x)|\leq M\}$. This in turn implies $|f(x)+g(x)|\leq (M+ CM + C)$ on that same set. But then $\mathcal D(A)$ is a core for $\mathcal D(M_{f+g})$, which implies that $A+B$ is essentially self-adjoint. Next up were Schrödinger operators. 'Unfortunately', Theorem XIII.96 in Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics vol 4 by Reed and Simon implies that (on $\mathbb R^d$, with $d\leq 3$) the inclusion $\mathcal D(-\Delta)\subset\mathcal D(V)$ is sufficient in order to conclude that $V$ is relatively $(-\Delta)$-bounded with bound $0$.","['examples-counterexamples', 'partial-differential-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
