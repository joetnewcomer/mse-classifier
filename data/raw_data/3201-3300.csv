22710,Center of a free product,"Let $A$ and $B$ be two groups and let $G=A*B$ be their free product. Suppose both $A$ and $B$ are nontrivial. I want now to prove that $G$ is infinite and that $Z(G)$ is trivial. I think I can prove that $G$ is infinite using this argument: two reduced words of $A*B$ are equal if and only if they have the same length and the ith letter of the first word is the same as the ith letter of the second one. Hence one can find a reduced word of $G$ of length arbitrarily big (since we are sure it won't be equal to a shorter word). Do you think it works? Has anyone another suggestion? On the other hand, I don't really have a clue for the second part except trying to analyze a long list of cases of reduced words and prove for each one that the only element with which they commute is the identity. Does anyone have a smarter idea? Thanks in advance!",['group-theory']

22753,What's the point of orthogonal diagonalisation?,"I've learned the process of orthogonal diagonalisation in an algebra course I'm taking...but I just realised I have no idea what the point of it is.

22759,Elementary question: dimension of the 1- affine space over the complex numbers,"I want to compute the dimension of $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^{1}$, that is the dimension of the affine space in 1 dimension over the field $\mathbb{C}$ but with respect the $\textbf{Euclidean}$ topology. My definition of dimension of a topological space $X$: is the greatest upper bound of the set of all ascending chains of length n that consists of irreducible non-empty and closed subsets of X ( $C_{0} \subset C_{1} \ .... \subset C_{n}$). Let $A \subset \mathbb{C}$ with say two points, then $A = \{x,y\} = \{x\} \cup \{y\}$. But $\mathbb{C}$ is a metric space hence every singleton is closed. Thus if A has at least two points then A is reducible. So the only irreducible sets are singletons because $\mathbb{C}$ with the Euclidean topology is not irreducible. Therefore the dimension is equal to $0$. Is the above correct? Also, another question, in general is there a quick or easy way to figure out the dimension of a given topological space? Thanks","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

22773,Continuous scalar fields on spheres,"I've been thinking about this for awhile now (I am trying to find a method of proving the Borsuk-Ulam theorem in 2 dimensions without resorting to the usual, and not so intuitive to non-mathematicians topological arguments).  I saw the question Does a continuous scalar field on a sphere have continuous loop of ""isothermic antipodes"" posted here, but am curious about a stronger statement. Say you have a continuous map $f$ from $S^2$ to $R$.  Let $U$ be the set of points such that $f(x)=f(-x)$ for $-x$ being the antipode of $x$.  I;ve been able to show that if $U$ is not the entire sphere, then every pair of antipodal points which are not mapped to the same value by $f$ are disconnected in $S^2-U$ (using an argument similar to one posted in the above question).  So; the set $U$ must then contain at least one continuous loop. What I am trying to show is that $U$ must contain a loop $C$ such that $C=-C$ (equivelantly, that there is a loop $C$ in $U$ for which $S^2-C$ is two disjoint ""hemispheres"" of equal areas). It seems to me that if this were not the case then you could construct a second map $g$ on $S^2$ such that its set of antipodes mapping to the same value would be completely disjoint from $U$ (since two loops on a sphere which are not ""equators"" in the sense that they divide the area of the sphere in half do not necessarily need to intersect), and then you could construct a map from $S^2$ to $R^2$ which had no antipodes mapping to the same value by $F=(f,g)$, which would contradict the theorem I know is true but would like to prove. Maybe I'm going about this in a difficult way, so any suggestions on how to study the nature of the set $U$ would be appreciated.","['general-topology', 'intuition']"

22807,"Is there an accepted term for ""locally"" nilpotent linear operators?","Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$ (not necessarily finite-dimensional) and $T : V \to V$ a linear operator. Is there an accepted term for the following condition on $T$? For any $v \in V$ the subspace $\text{span}(v, Tv, T^2 v, ...)$ is finite-dimensional, and $T$ is nilpotent on any such subspace. For example, the differential operator $\frac{d}{dx}$ acting on $k[x]$ satisfies this condition but is not nilpotent. Motivation: When $\text{char}(k) = 0$, this condition ensures that the exponential $e^T : V \to V$ is well-defined without giving $V$ any additional structure, since $e^T v$ is a finite sum for any particular $v$.","['linear-algebra', 'terminology']"

22839,Questions about derivative and differentiation,"For a real-valued function $f$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ or its subset, is it possible that it is
differentiable at one point and not
in one of its neighbourhoods except
the point itself? is it possible that it is
differentiable over an interval, but
its derivative over the interval is
not continuous? I found on this link that for
$f(x) = x^2 \sin(1/x)$, when $x$ is not
0, the derivative is $2x \sin(1/x) -
    \cos(1/x)$ which does not have a limit
as x approaches 0, but the
derivative of $f$ does exist at 0:
$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} ( h^2

22855,Elementary question about coordinate ring,"I'm trying to learn by myself some algebraic geometry, since I will probably be taking an elementary course next semester. I have some trouble understanding the following: Let $Y=Z(y-x^{2})$ then by definition $Y$ is algebraic set in $\mathbb{A}^{2}$. The author finds the coordinate ring $K[x,y]/I(Y)$ where $I(Y)=\{f \in K[x,y]: f=0 \ \textrm{in Y}\}$. Claim: $K[x,y]/I(y) \cong K[t]$ where $t$ is an indeterminate. Define a map $\phi: K[x,y] \rightarrow K[t]$ by $x \mapsto t$ and $y \mapsto t^{2}$. Then $f$ is a ring morphism by the universal property. Questions: 1) Why it suffices to say where to send $x$ and $y$? 2) How do you check using the universal property that this is indeed a ring morphism? I don't know how to apply this property 3) What is the reason of sending $x$ to $t$ and $y \mapsto t^{2}$,i.e how do you figure out the images of $x$ and $y$ under $\phi$ ?

22866,From Hartshorne's Geometry: Euclid and Beyond: intersections of four circles forming a cyclic quadrilateral?,"I'm trying to go through the section of Newer Results in Hartshorne's Geometry: Euclid and Beyond. This particular exercise has been bugging me for a good while: My first approach was to show that the perpendicular bisectors of $A'B'$ and $A'D'$ intersect at the same point as the perpendicular bisectors of $A'B'$ and $B'C'$. I figured since the center of the circle circumscribed around a triangle has its center at the intersection of the three perpendicular bisectors, this would show that $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ and $D'$ would all be on the same circle. However, I didn't see any way to show this. I also tried extending $A'D'$ and $A'C'$ down into the circle containing $D$, $D'$ and $C$ with hopes that it $\angle D'A'C'\cong\angle D'B'C'$, but this seemed like a dead end also. I'm going a little mad, if any one sees a possible solution, I'd be quite grateful. Thanks.",['geometry']
22871,Efficient sampling of a mixture model,"I know there is an easy way to sample standard mixture models if the mixture components can be easily sampled. But, I have a slightly different scenario and I'm wondering if there is an analogous method (or any method at all that is nice). I'll first explain the standard scenario so there is no confusion, and then explain how my problem is different. Sorry if some of this is too remedial, I just want my question to be completely clear. A standard mixture model has pdf $$f_X(x) = \sum_i w_i f^i_X(x)$$ where the $w_i$'s are non-negative and sum to one and the $f^i$'s are pdfs. A pretty important mixture model is mixture of Gaussians, where the $f^i$'s are normal distributions with different means and variances, i.e., $$f_X(x) = \sum_i w_i \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i; x)$$ I can easily sample this distribution with two samples. I'll assume there is a latent variable that governs which of the components generates the value of the random variable. Thus, I can choose $i$ with probability $w_i$ and then sample $\mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i; \cdot)$ to generate my sample $\bar{x}$. In my case, I have a slightly different mixture model $$f_X(x) = \sum_i w_i f^i_X(x) - \sum_j w_j f^j_X(x)$$ Basically, some of the weights are negative so the components $w_j f^j$ subtract from the density at any $x$. Assume that $f_X$ is a pdf, so it is non-negative and integrates to one. Of course, there are methods for generating samples from arbitrary distributions, but it seems that computing the cdf for this one may be hard. What is the best way to draw a sequence of samples from this distribution? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.",['probability']
22873,Why does the following proof of the Nested Interval Property require the Axiom of Completeness?,"The proof in my text is as such: Let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3,\ldots$ be the labels of the left- and right- hand endpoints respectively. Consider the set A of the left-hand endpoints of the intervals, and let x = sup A. Since x is an upper bound for A, we have $a_n \leq x$. Since each $b_n$ is an upper bound for A, we have $x\leq b_n$. Then since $a_n\leq x \leq b_n$, we can conclude that $x\in I_n$ for every choice of $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Hence x is in the infinite intersection of nested intervals. My question is.. could the proof work with $x = a_n$ instead? It seems that all the key properties would still hold -- $a_n \leq a_n \leq b_n$ for all n. This does not seem to require the AoC to be true.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

The remaining side, side X, has a 5% chance. All sides look identical; I want to identify side X.

22884,Similar result to Burnside's lemma,"I have an exercise scribbled down, and I am not sure what it is asking. It is somewhat similar to Burnside's lemma.

For each $g \in G$, let $X^g$ denote the set of elements in $X$ fixed by $g$. $$\sum_g |X^g|^2 = |G| \cdot \text{(number of orbits of a stabilizer)}$$ I am not sure what it means by ""orbit of a stabilizer"". I am guessing that it refers to the action of $G$ on cosets of a stabilizer by multiplication.

22937,Finding the mean distance between n points evenly distributed in a disc of radius r,"In reading this article about updated estimates for the number of exoplanets in the Milky Way, I am curious how to get an estimate of the mean distance between them.  The Milky Way is ~50,000 light years in radius and an average of ~1000 ly in thickness, and the article estimates there to be ~500 million exoplanets in the habitable zone around their stars. To simplify this greatly (grotesquely!), I think the galaxy can be thought of as a plane, since I want to know the method of doing this for a disc anyway, and there are so many estimates here, it shouldn't affect the results greatly.  So, the area of this disc would be: $\pi (50000ly)^2 \approx 7853981634 ly^2$ However, beyond this, to find an even distribution of 500,000,000 points, I'm not really sure how to go about that.  Given this, I can later apply it to an oblate disk, but I'd like to know the general method of evenly distributing points in a circle, and possibly finding the distance between them if it's not straightforward.

I'm asking this because I want some integral to converge but I only know the values on $1_{(x_1,x_2)}$. Maybe we can get to Lipschitz functions that way? Edit to be more specific. Usually we define an integral for a positive function in this sense. First if we have

22999,How many ways can we let people into a movie theater if they only have half-dollars and dollars?,"My interest in combinatorics was recently sparked when I read about the many things that the Catalan numbers count, as found by Richard Stanley. I picked up a copy of Brualdi's Combinatorics, and while browsing the section on counting sequences I found a nice little puzzle that has definitely puzzled me. Let $m$ and $n$ be nonnegative integers with $n\geq m$. There are $m+n$ people in line to get into a theater for which admission if $50$ cents. Of the $m+n$ people, $n$ have a $50$-cent piece and $m$ have a $\$ 1$ dollar bill. The box offices opens with an empty cash register. Show that the number of ways the people can line up so that change is available when needed is
  $$
\frac{n-m+1}{n+1}\binom{m+n}{m}.
$$ I first noted that the first person to enter must be one of the $n$ with a half-dollar. Now the register has a half-dollar change. The second person can be either a person with a half-dollar or a dollar. In the first case, the register will now have two half-dollars, in the second case, the register will now have one dollar bill. So it seems to me that when one of the $n$ people with a half-dollar enters, the number of half-dollars in the register increases by $1$, and when one of the $m$ people with a bill enters, the number of half-dollars decreases by $1$ but the number of bills increases by $1$. I tried to model this by looking at paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The $x$-axis is like the number of half-dollars, and the $y$-axis is the number of bills. You start at $(0,0)$, and you can take steps forward $(1,0)$ or backwards diagonally $(-1,1)$ corresponding to who enters, but you must always stay in the first quadrant of the plane without crossing over the axes. The goal is to make $m+n$ moves, and I figured maybe the number of such paths is counted by $\frac{n-m+1}{n+1}\binom{m+n}{m}$, but I'm not sure how to show this. I don't know if this observation simplifies the problem at all, as I don't know how to finish up. I'd be happy to see how this problem is done, thank you.","['puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

23006,"The role of the ""hidden"" probability space on which random variables are defined","One learns in a probability course that a (real) random variable is a measurable mapping of some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbf{P})$ into $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$. But as soon as one gets into topics that are a little advanced, the space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbf{P})$ is not mentioned unless it is absolutely necessary. After a long time of frustration, I have become quite comfortable with this language. But some things still trouble me. The following kind of reasoning comes up in the book I'm reading: The author says that $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ is a family of random variables and specifies the distribution of each random variable. Then he phrases some (random) proposition $A((X_i)_{i_\in I})$ (this is a little imprecise, I hope you get the meaning) and talks about $\mathbf{P}[A((X_i)_{i_\in I}) \text{ holds}]$. My question: Let $(\Omega',\mathcal{A}',\mathbf{P}')$ be another probability space and $(Y_i)_{i\in I}$ random variables such that, for each $i\in I$, the distribution of $Y_i$ is the same as the distribution of $X_i$. Is it then obvious that $\mathbf{P}[(A(X_i)_{i_\in I}) \text{ holds}]=\mathbf{P}'[(A(Y_i)_{i_\in I}) \text{ holds}]$? Now my guess is that this is true, but needs a proof, which is not completely trivial in case $I$ is infinite, at least not for a beginner. However, in the book this problem isn't discussed at all. So did I miss something? Edit: I'm not sure whether the question was correctly understood, so I'll rephrase it a little. Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbf{P})$ and $(\Omega',\mathcal{A}',\mathbf{P}')$ be two probability spaces, $I$ a set, and $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ and $(Y_i)_{i\in I}$ families of random variables on $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbf{P})$ and $(\Omega',\mathcal{A}',\mathbf{P}')$ respectively such that, for each $i\in I$, the distribution of $X_i$ is equal to the distribution of $Y_i$.

$$T\left(\begin{bmatrix}

c & d

1 & -2\\ 
1 & 0\\

Possible Duplicate: On sort-of-linear functions It is an interesting exercise to show that $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb R ~\colon \mathbb Q)$ is trivial. The only solution I know hinges on the fact that the automorphism is order-preserving, which in turn depends on the fact that $\theta(xy)=\theta(x)\theta(y)$ for $\theta \in \operatorname{Aut} \mathbb R$. Now, a function $L:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ with just the property that $L(x+y)=L(x)+L(y)$ can be shown to preserve multiplication on the rationals. And, I have been unsuccessful in trying to extend this fact to the reals.

23153,How to Interpret Time Scales in a Dynamic System,"Here I have a question about time scales in dynamic systems - for reference you can look at a previous question that spurs this one: Minimizing the cost of a path in a dynamic system That question was about finding the minimum cost path from $0$ to $c$ on the real line, where cost is quadratic in the size of the step at each time $t$, and there was a drift towards 0 of $-P(t)$, $P(t)$ being your position at time $t$.  The question is, what is the minimum cost path, when you  minimize over size of step each period, and number of steps, subject only to the constraint of eventually getting to $c$. The solution in this discrete time problem is to see that the problem is essentially linear, with linear constraints, and a solution easy to characterize for a given length of path $T$, and whose cost is decreasing in $T$, so that the minimum cost path is to take a infinite amount of time to get from o to $c$.  Taking very very small steps is the way to go.  Well and good, the question is answered. It may then seem natural to ask, ""What about the continuous time analog to that problem?""  That is, if the original dynamics are given by $$
P(t) = (1-\gamma) P(t-1) + \gamma x(t) 
$$ where $\gamma<1$ limits fast I can move, and which can be written $$
\frac{P(t)- P(t-1)}{\gamma} = - P(t-1) +x(t),
$$ What if we send $\gamma$ to zero, essentially discretizing the time interval finer and finer?  The problem then becomes to solve the following problem:  Minimize the cost: $$
\int _1^T ( x(t))^2 dt,
$$ subject to the constraint that P(0) = 0, P(T) = c, and P goes from 0 to c, and $P$ follows the following dynamics: $$
\dot{P} = -P(t) + x(t) 
$$ The constraint is essentially  that $P$ solves a particular ODE.  I ask mathematica about it, and am informed that $P$ has the following form: $$
P(z) = e^{-z} ( K + \int_1^{z} e^t x(t) dt),
$$ where $K$ is a constant of integration.  So, adding in the boundary conditions, the constraint on the minimization problem is that $$
e^{-T} \int_1^{T} e^t x(t) dt = c,
$$
that is, whatever $x(t)$ is, $P$ must end up at $c$ at time $T$.  So the lagrangian is $$
L = \int _1^T ( x(t))^2 dt - \lambda (e^{-T} \int_1^{T} e^t x(t) dt - c)
$$ But note, just as before, this lagrangian is simply quadratic in $x(t)$, and can be solved for a fixed $T$. When I ask mathematica to do so, I find that $$
x(t) = \frac{e^t c}{e^{t-1} - e},
$$
Which is very simple, linear in distance to be moved $c$.  Note that this doesn't depend on $T$, the total time length of the path;  indeed, when we minimize cost with respect to $T$, we find that cost in minimized for 
$$
T = \frac{1}{2} (1 - 2 ProductLog[-1, -(1/(2 \sqrt{e}))]),
$$
where ""ProductLog(-1,z)"" is mathematica's way of calculating Lambert's W function.  So a finite $T$ is cost minimizing, and it is about 2.25643. Now, this isn't necessarily a contradiction to the discrete case; after all, a finite length of time in the continuous model is an infinite number of periods in the discrete model, so the answers are not in conflict.  However, the answer in the continuous model might easily have been ""infinite amount of (continuous) time,"" but it wasn't.  My questions are Why not? How to interpret the value of cost-minimizing $T$ - what does it mean?  How much ""time"" is that? The point of all this is to ""justify"" some simluations of the discrete system we are doing;  we have a problem where we are simulating random shocks to a dynamic system, and we have some theorems that say, mean time to escape of from some point is a function of this cost minimization problem, IE the cost minimizing way to escape is the dominant way to escape, the most likely way to escape.  But we are having a hard time interpreting the cost minimizing escape; it says that in the discrete case, the dominant escape should take an infinite amount of time, while in the continuous case(which the theorems are actually written for), it takes a finite amount of time, a time which seems to have nothing to do with the distance attempting to be escaped! Well, obviously no one had anything to say on this issue - is it due to a poorly framed question?  Would this question be more appropriate  at mathoverflow?","['optimization', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"
23157,Notation question with Dirichlet processes,"This is a question on how to make sense of an equation (specifically, a description of a distribution) that, no matter how I slice it and dice it, always has some left over pieces that don't fit. The equation in question describes a random variable $G$ drawn from a Dirichlet process $\textrm{DP}(\alpha_0,G_0)$:
\begin{align}
G = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k \delta_{\theta_k}
\end{align}
where $\alpha_0 > 0$ and $G_0$ is some base measure. The $\beta_k$ are stick breaking weights that depend on $\alpha_0$ and $\theta_k$ are atoms drawn from $G_0$. The full description can be found at the top of page 4 of this paper . My first question is whether I can read $G$ like a function. Say, if I have some ""atom"" (which term I don't fully understand) $\theta_j$, can I plug it in like:
\begin{align}
G(\theta_j) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \beta_k \delta_{\theta_k} (\theta_j) \newline
&= \sum_{k \:\textrm{where} \: \theta_k = \theta_j} \beta_k
\end{align}
meaning if I happened to draw an atom that was identical to more than one $\theta_k$ I am just adding up the relevant weights $\beta_k$. And that the random variable $G$ itself can be loosely understood as very long vector of weights $(\ldots,G_j = \sum_{k \:\textrm{where} \: \theta_k = \theta_j} \beta_k,\ldots)$ such that it is just a repartitioning of the infinite dimension vector $(\ldots,\beta_k,\ldots)$. But if I interpret it this way, I get into trouble because apparently, you're supposed to use the $G$ to draw the so-called ""atoms"" again. So I revise my understanding to think of $G$ as a multinomial distribution. But then the equation that sums over the infinitely many values of $\beta_k$ doesn't make any sense. A sum is a sum. How do you draw things from a sum, which has just a fixed scalar value? Is my interpretation wrong? Whether it's wrong at the foundations or wrong in subtle ways, please correct me regardless. I'm trying to make the leap from the prob/statistics in DeGroot's book to understanding measure theory and nonparametric processes and it's things like these that completely throw me for a loop.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Then, since we need to reduce both length and curvature, we need to minimize $L(y) + \lambda \kappa(y)$ over the interval $[x_1,x_n]$. This reduces to minimizing $F(y) = \int_{x1}^{x_n} \sqrt{1+y'^2} dx  + \lambda \frac{ y''} { (1+y'^2)^{3/2}}$. Doubts: (1) Is $F(y)$ the correct functional? It seems not. (2) How do I alter $F(y)$ to ensure that it passes through all points in $P$?","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus']"
23193,Not lifting your pen on the $n\times n$ grid,"Does there exist $n$, and $r<2n-2$, such that the $n\times n$ square grid can be connected with an unbroken path of $r$ straight lines? Note: This has essentially already been asked - see this MSE thread.  I am posting this question because I wanted to explicitly focus on one of the unanswered parts. Notice that $2n-1$ is the trivial solution.  This is obtained by either spiralling towards the center, or by zig-zagging up and down.  On the other MSE thread, I posted an answer showing $2n-2$ was possible for $n\geq 3$. (this is obtained by reducing to the $3\times 3$ case)  I felt $2n-2$ should be optimal, but I couldn't think of a proof.  (Also, it is not necessarily clear that for a 100 billion by 100 billion grid you can't use some kind of cleverness to eliminate one single line) This has been bothering me since I saw it, and I would like to know if anyone has any ideas. Thanks, Edit:  This is regarding an question/answer I received:  Not only are 45 degree lines allowed, but lines in any direction.  Naturally 0,45,90 seem like the best since those angles will intersect the most lattice points, and we ask ourselves ""Will any optimal solution consist only of lines at these angles?"".  The answer is a definite no .  Consider the following solution to the $10\times 10$ grid which uses 18 lines (so $2n-2$, i.e. currently optimal).  Also there is this solution to the $8\times 8 $ grid using 14 lines. Interestingly, this solution to the $10\times 10 $ generalizes to give another $2n-2$ line solution to the $n\times n$ grid when $n$ is even. (I found this $8\times8$ and $10\times 10$ solution on a link posted by user3123 on the other question page.  Specifically it was this link.)","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics']"

Recall that the operators $\langle \cdot, e_i \rangle e_j$ form a basis of $N(H)$.

Odds of a quadruple with the remaining 4 dice: (b) : $(1/5)^4 $ Then, the probability that from rolling 7 dice that there is at least three that match, and no more than three, would be: (c) : $ \frac{6  \binom{7}{3} * 5^4}{6^7}- (1/5)^4 $ Exactly two sets of three: (d) : $ \frac{6  \binom{7}{3}  \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1}}{ 6^7} $ Maybe?  My thought process was that if $\binom{7}{3}$ will give me a set of three, then with the remaining 4, I could pick 3 yielding $\binom{4}{3}$ with 1 leftover.  I realize this is probably wrong.  Why? What would be the proper way to go about this? Exactly one set of three: Then to find the probability that there is one and only one set of three from 7 dice, we could take the probability of one or more sets of three (c) and subtract the probability of exactly two sets (d), for: $ \frac{6  \binom{7}{3}  5^4}{ 6^7} - (1/5)^4 - \frac{6  \binom{7}{3}  \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} }{ 6^7} $ (e) : $  \left(\frac{6  \binom{7}{3}}{ 6^7}\right) \left( 5^4 -  \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} \right) - (1/5)^4 $ Is this at all on the right path?

Now a point on $X_\eta$, say $p$ is also a point on $X$ itself. Note the generic point of $X$ is the generic point of $X_\eta$, say $\zeta$. All the other points on $X_\eta$ are closed in the curve and are height $1$ points on $X$. I read in a paper that for any point on the generic fiber, $p$, we have $\mathcal{O}_{X,p}\simeq \mathcal{O}_{X_\eta, p}$, and at first I just thought to myself that it's obvious, but when I tried to actually think of a reason it wasn't so obvious. If $X_\eta$ were open in $X$, then this would be clear since restricting to an open and then taking a stalk doesn't cause problems, but why should this still be true for the generic fiber which is neither open nor closed?

Now we have $m$ independent observations of those trials in discrete independent time-slots. For example: let:
 $n=4, m=3$ The result of the aforementioned trials is: for $X_1: ((1,0,0,1),(0,0,1,1),(0,0,0,1))$ for $X_2: ((0,0,1,0),(0,1,1,0),(0,1,0,0))$ where each of ""inner-sequences"" is one of $m$ independent sequence of Bernoulli trials. Now we aggregate each of those ""inner-sequences"" into a Beta distribution function to represent the posterior probability of success/failure of each variable in different observation.

$X_2:(B_{21},B_{22},B_{23})$ where each $B_{ij}$ is a Beta distribution function associated with the corresponding sequence of trials in the previous part of the example.

Prove that the number of elements in $\{(x_1, \ldots, x_k) : x_i \in A, i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}, x_i \neq x_j \Longleftrightarrow i \neq j, j \in \{1, \ldots, k\}\}$ is given by the formula $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$. Thanks for your replies so far!","['elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics']"
23443,"Function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous and bounded, but not uniformly continuous [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Prove that the function$\ f(x)=\sin(x^2)$ is not uniformly continuous on the domain $\mathbb{R}$. (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . I found an example of a function $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous and bounded, but is not uniformly continuous. It is $\sin(x^2)$. I think it's not uniformly continuous because the derivative is bigger and bigger as $x$ increases. But I don't know how to prove this is uniformly continuous. Is $\sin(x^2)$ uniformly continuous then? if it isn't, can you guys think of any other examples? thanks",['real-analysis']
23446,What was used to establish this equivalence? [Textbook],"To solve for the $\sin^{-1} z$ ($z$ element of $\mathbb{C}$), the book reads that $w = \sin^{-1} z$ when $z = \sin w$ implies: $w = \sin^{-1} z$ when $z = (e^{iw} - e^{-iw})/2i$  implies: $(e^{iw})^2 - 2iz(e^{iw}) - 1 = 0$ * I don't see (2) implies (3). I mean it looks like the first step they used was mutiply out the $2i$, then subtract $2zi$ from both sides, but I'm lost after that.","['algebra-precalculus', 'complex-analysis']"
23451,How to find the solution for $\frac{2x-3}{x+1} \leq 1$?,"I have the following inequality: $$\frac{2x-3}{x+1}\leq1$$ so, considering $x \neq -1$, I started multiplying $x+1$ both sides: $$2x-3\leq x+1$$ then I subtracted $x$ both sides: $$x-3\leq1$$ and then sum $3$ both sides: $$x\leq4$$ Therefore, my solution for $x\neq-1$ is: $$(-\infty,4]$$ But the book solution is: $$(-1,4]$$ What I did wrong?","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"
