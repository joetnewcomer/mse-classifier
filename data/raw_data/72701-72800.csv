893517,"How to ""see at a glance"" the solution to the exercise ""Show that $\langle (1,2,3... n),(1,2,3... m)\rangle$ contains a 3 cycle, if $1 < n < m$""?","I tried the commutator of the generators and it worked, but I had no real justification for making that computation. Is there a perspective from which trying the commutator is the ""obvious"" thing to think about? I was inspired to try the commutator because of the following exercise: Let $x,y \in Sym(\Omega)$. If $\Gamma = supp(x) \cap supp(y)$, then $[x,y] \subseteq \Gamma \cup \Gamma^x \cup \Gamma^y$. In particular, if $|\Gamma|= 1$, then $[x,y]$ is a 3-cycle. This is not exactly the same, however.","['permutations', 'group-theory']"
893519,Tangent bundle of $S^2$ not diffeomorphic to $S^2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Are $T\mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ different? (1 answer) Closed 3 years ago . I am trying to show that the tangent bundle of $S^2$ not diffeomorphic to $S^2\times \mathbb{R}^2$. This is from an exam, where there is a hint stating that this is more than showing that $TS^2$ is non-trivial. I know how to show the hairy ball theorem, according to which $TS^n$ is non-trivial iff n is even. I also know that a vector bundle $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ of rank $m$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is trivial (by definition) iff there exists a diffeomorphism $f:E\rightarrow M\times \mathbb{R}^m$ such that for every $p\in M$, $f$ induces a vector space isomorphism $f:\pi^{-1}(p)\rightarrow \{p\}\times \mathbb{R}^m$. So I see that showing that $TS^2$ is non-trivial only guarantees that $TS^2$ is not diffeomorphic to $S^2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ via a diffeomorphism satisfying the property above, but it is not enough to conclude that there isn't any diffeomorphism. How can I show this then?",['differential-geometry']
893526,How to express “b is a power of 10” – Typographical Number Theory in Gödel Escher Bach,"The book Gödel, Escher, Bach (GEB) by Douglas R. Hofstadter introduces a formal system called “Typographical Number Theory” (TNT). It's essentially first order predicate logic over the universe of natural numbers, with addition and multiplication but no exponentiation. Numbers are encoded using zero and the successor function $S$. In one excercise, explicitely described as hard, one is asked to formalize the condition that a given number is a power of $10$.
My solution seems too simple, and GEB has been my first introduction to TNT, so I am doubtful that I have gotten this problem correct. Of course, due to my position on the learning curve, I think the Dunning-Kruger effect limits me from noticing my own flaw in this solution. Can anyone tell me how this is wrong, or if it is somehow miraculously correct? $d$ is a power of $10$ iff: $$\exists! a: \exists! b: \exists c: \exists d: (((a = SS0) \land (b = SSSSS0)) \land (((a \cdot c) \cdot (b \cdot c)) = d)) \\

I have one question regarding the method of non-dimensionalization. How do they come up with the new dimensionless state and time variables? Here's what the parameters and variables mean: $S$, $R_l$, and $R_h$ are the bacteria strains. $b_s$, $b_l$, and $b_h$ are birth rates of the bacteria strains. $\mu$ is the natural death rate. $i$ is the immune system clearing rate. $T$ is the treatment clearing rate. $m_1$, $m_2$, $p$ are mutation rates. $\alpha$ is the level of drug resistance. The system is as follows,
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= S(b_s - \mu - i - T - m_1) - pS(R_l + R_h) \\
\frac{dR_l}{dt} &= R_l(b_l - \mu - i - \alpha T - m_2) + m_1 S + pR_l(S - R_h) \\ 
\frac{dR_h}{dt} &= R_h(b_h - \mu - i - \alpha T) + m_2R_l + pR_h(S + R_l)

893710,pseudo inverse of a finite-to-one continuous map and measurability,"Given that $\pi: X \to Y$ is a continuous onto map between compact metric spaces such that the fiber $\pi^{-1}(y)$ is a finite subset of $X$ for all $y$, is the map $y \mapsto \pi^{-1}(y)$ guaranteed to behave in a measurable way? For example, is it guaranteed that $y \mapsto |\pi^{-1}(y)|$ is Borel measurable, and that for each Borel measurable $A \subset X$, the subset  $\{ y \in Y : A \cap \pi^{-1}(y) \neq \emptyset \}$ is Borel measurable? For any concrete enough class of maps satisfying the assumption, there always seems to be a way to prove the conclusion just for that class, so I could not find any particular counter-example. Remark 1. It is easy to think of a zig zag like map from the interval onto itself such that $y \mapsto |\pi^{-1}(y)|$ is neither upper nor lower semi-continuous. So the idea that $\{y \in Y:  |\pi^{-1}(y)| \ge k\}$ might always be a closed subset does not work for establishing the partial conclusion that $y \mapsto |\pi^{-1}(y)|$ is measurable. Remark 2. The measure theoretical counterpart (where measures are involved) has positive answer, but that implies nothing about the original problem. The measure theoretical counterpart is: given a measure preserving map $\pi: (X, \mu) \to (Y, \nu)$ between two Lebesgue spaces (i.e. standard probability space) such that the disintegration $\mu_y$ is supported on a finite subset of $X$ for $\nu$-a.e. $y$, then the map $y \mapsto \bar{\pi}(y)$ where $\bar{\pi}(y) := \{ x \in X: \mu_y(x) > 0 \}$, which is $\nu$-a.e. well defined (unlike the map $y \mapsto \pi^{-1}(y)$ which is not well defined), is a measurable map in some sense. For example, $\{ y \in Y : A \cap \bar{\pi}(y) \neq \emptyset \}$ is measurable for any measurable $A \subset X$. If $A$ in that expression runs over elements of appropriate finite partitions of $X$, then the map $y \mapsto \bar{\pi}(y)$ corresponds a map from $Y$ to the set of binary sequences, and the latter map is measurable, which we may take as the meaning of the former map being measurable. (Update) Remark 3. The counterpart for the case where only Y (and not X) is a probability space also has a positive answer: if $\pi: X \to Y$ is a Borel-measurable (not necessarily onto) map from a Polish space $X$ to another Polish space $Y$ and if $\nu$ is a probability measure on $Y$, then it is easy to check that $\{y \in Y: |\pi^{-1}{y}| \ge k\}$ and $\{y \in Y:  A \cap \pi^{-1}{y} \ne \emptyset \}$ are analytic sets and hence $\nu$-measurable. This might be useful for studying measures in $\pi_*^{-1}(\nu)$.","['measure-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"

What is an example of failure of this property, if we drop the compactness assumption? Some thoughts: I believe it's enough if fibers are paracompact, instead of compact (proof goes similarly to the one I know for compact case, unless I've overlooked something silly). Fibers of closed maps from $T_1$ spaces are necessarily closed, so this rules out maps from paracompact spaces (e.g. all metric spaces, by Stone theorem), since paracompactness is weakly hereditary.","['general-topology', 'quotient-spaces', 'separation-axioms', 'examples-counterexamples']"

893875,Sorting of prime gaps,"Let $g_i$ be the $i^{th}$ prime gap $p_{i+1}-p_i.$ If we rearrange the sequence $ (g_{n,i})_{i=1}^n$ so that for any finite $n$ , if the gaps are arranged from smallest to largest, we have a new sequence $(\hat{g}_{n,i})_{i=1}^n.$ For example, for $n = 10,$ $$(g_{10,i})_{i=1}^{10} = 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2; $$ $$(\hat{g}_{10,i})_{i=1}^{10} = 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6. $$ We can ask about  the number of elements of the original sequence, which are fixed under the sorting operation. For the example above $g_i = \hat{g}_i$ for $i = 1,2,3,5,8.$ The number of elements fixed by sorting appears to grow in a familiar way. Letting $f(n)$ be the number fixed for given $n$ : $$\begin{array}{c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | } n & 500 & 5000 & 50000 &  500000 & 1000000 & 2000000 \\ \hline
f(n) & 82 &  614 & 4843 & 39072 & 74195  & 141777 \end{array}$$ For comparison, $n$ and $\pi(n)$ (number of primes not exceeding $n$ ) are: $$\begin{array}{c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |} n & 500 & 5000 & 50000 &  500000 & 1000000 & 2000000  \\ \hline
\pi(n) & 95 & 669 & 5133 & 41538 & 78498 & 148933 \end{array}$$ and the ratio $f(n)/\pi(n)$ at least for the numbers above appears to approach 1. So my question is whether this might be an indirect consequence of the prime number theorem? Edit: This process seems to approximate the number of primes on intervals generally. For example, if we sort the prime gaps from $g_{120000}$ to $g_{127000}$ , 556 are fixed. And $\pi(127000) - \pi(120000) = 600.$ So maybe a better way of putting the question is, why might it be true that $$ f(g_m,g_{m+1},...,g_k) \approx \pi(k) - \pi(m)?$$ Some things I have looked at. The prime number theorem gives us that $(g_n)$ is not monotone. I don't have an idea to support the suggestion that $f(n)/n \sim 1/\log n.$ If the probability (loosely speaking) that $g_k = \hat{g_k}$ is $1/\log n$ then maybe this can be explained in terms of the multiplicity, in some average sense, of $g_k$ in a particular finite sequence of gaps. It occurs to me that if the number of gaps less than $n$ of size (say) 2 is $k(n),$ it is not possible to understand the probabilities involved without knowing whether $k(n)$ is bounded as $n$ gets large. So maybe the idea can be shown to be incorrect but showing it to be correct might require answering the threshold question about gaps. Taking the suggestion above as true, assuming infinite gaps of all lengths (a conjecture of Polignac) and letting $c_k(n)$ be the number of prime gaps of length $k$ for given $n,$ if we assume also something akin to a well-distributed property in the distribution of gaps of length $k$ (which follows in a qualified way from a conjecture of Hardy-Littlewood $^1$ ) we have a simplification of notation based on geometry: $$ f(n) \approx S = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k = 1}^{n} c_k(n)^2\approx \frac{n}{\log n}.$$ If nothing else, the expression conveys the idea of an average. While it doesn't seem fortuitous I cannot justify it. Some numbers: $$\begin{array}{c | c | c |c | }  n & S & \pi(n) & S/ \pi(n)  \\ \hline
100 & 21.01  & 25 &0.8404  \\ \hline

Consider the basis element $U = \displaystyle{\prod_{n = 1}^\infty \left(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}\right)}$ of the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Let $x \in f^{-1}(U)$. Then, $f(x) \in U$. This implies that $|f_n(x)| < \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This further implies that $|x| < \frac{1}{n^2}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So, it must be the case that $x = 0$. But then, $f^{-1}(U) = \{0\}$, which is not open in the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $f$ is not continuous in the box topology. Now, let $0 < \epsilon < 1$, and let $B = B_\bar\rho(0, \epsilon)$ be a basis element for the uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Suppose $x \in f^{-1}(B)$. Then, $f(x) \in B$. This implies that $\bar d(f(x_i), 0) < \epsilon$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Since $\epsilon < 1$, we have $d(f_i(x), 0) < \epsilon$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$. This implies that $|kx| < \epsilon$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. This implies that $x = 0$. Since $\{0\}$ is not open in the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is not continuous in the uniform topology.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"
893883,On the criterion of convergence of infinite products of complex numbers,"I have troubles in understanding the proof of the criterion which states that an infinite product exists iff the series of the complex logarithms of the terms of the product converges. In particular, the proof says that if the infinite product converges then for every $\varepsilon >0$ exists $N$ natural s.t. for $p\geq m>N$ we have $\vert \prod_{n=m}^p a_n -1 \vert< \varepsilon$; so for $\varepsilon$ small enough $\vert\arg(\prod_{n=m}^p a_n)\vert<\pi/2$, so $\log(\prod_{n=m}^p a_n)=\sum_{n=m}^p \log(a_n)$ tends to zero for $m,p \to +\infty$, hence the series of the principal logarithms satisfies the Cauchy convergence criterion. My doubt is: why for the complex logarithm case the logarithm of the product is the sum of the logarithms? Shouldn't be there a correction term on the sum of the arguments? 
In which cases the complex principal logarithm of a product is the sum of the principal logarithms? Thanks a lot!","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"

893908,Complex automata Rubiks cube question (with picture) help needed,"Question 1 A Rubik’s Cube is a puzzle in the shape of a cube. Each face is covered by nine
stickers, each of which is coloured with one of six colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, andyellow. An internal mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved one has to manipulate the cube so that each face again consists of one colour. Pictures of a Rubik cube in its initial state, and one with the colours confused, are shown. Let us consider a fixed position of the cube and we will then label the basic moves as follows:
F (Front): rotate the side facing the solver through 90 degrees clockwise;
B (Back): rotate the side opposite the front through 90 degrees clockwise;
U (Up): rotate the side above the front side through 90 degrees clockwise;
D (Down): rotate the side opposite the top side through 90 degrees clockwise;
L (Left): rotate the side directly to the left of the front through 90 degrees clockwise;
R (Right): rotate the side directly to the right of the front through 90 degrees clockwise.
Consider the set S of all sequences of moves that start with the cube in its initial state (i.e. with each face consisting of a single colour) and which return the cube to that state. Show that S is a regular language over the alphabet {F,B,U,D,L,R}.

A corollary of this is: Corollary: If $m<n$, then there exists no smooth surjective map $f:M\to N$. Now, I am quite certain that my proof of the following fact is correct: Claim: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two quasi-projective, irreducible algebraic varieties (over an algebraically closed field $k$) of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively. If $m<n$, then there exists no smooth surjective map $f:X\to Y$. Proof: Assume there was such a map $f:X\to Y$. Then it would induce an injective map $f^*:K(Y)\to K(X)$ between the fields of rational functions of the two varieties. We know that:
$$\begin{array}{l}K(X)=k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)[u]\\K(Y)=k(y_1,\ldots,y_n)[v]\end{array}$$
where $k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$ is a purely transcendental field extension of $k$, and $u$ is algebraic over $k(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$, and similarly for $K(Y)$. Consider the elements $f^*(y_i)\in K(X)$. They are transcendental over $k$, indeed if there was a polynomial $p\in k[z]$ with:
$$0=p(f^*(y_i))=f^*(p(y_i))$$
then by injectivity of $f^*$ we would have $p(y_i)=0$, which is a contradiction. Similary, these elements are algebraically independent, since:
$$0=p(f^*(y_1),\ldots,f^*(y_n))=f^*(p(y_1,\ldots,y_n))$$
would imply algebraical dependence of the $y_i$'s. So, the elements $f^*(y_i)$ form an algebraically independent set of transcendental element of cardinality $n$ in $K(X)$, which contradicts the assumption that $X$ had dimension $m<n$.

894421,Finding the transfinite diameter of the level sets of complex logarithm,"Given a simply-connected domain $|g(z)|\ge C$ how can I find the analytic conformal mapping guaranteed by the Riemann mapping theorem? In particular I'm interested in finding the transfinite diameter of the domain $|\log z|\le C$ as a function of $C$. As I understand it—I had to look up the terms—this means finding a function $f$ mapping the closure of the exterior $|\log z|\ge C$ to the unit disk, with $f(\infty)=0$, and the the answer I want will be $f'(\infty).$ So what conformal mapping $f$ sends $|\log z|\ge C$ to the unit disk, or (if it's easier) what is $f'(\infty)$? Edit: Hagen correctly pointed out that there are issues with $\log z$ near $\pi$. For my application you can assume that $0<C<3.$ In fact probably $C<1.$ Edit: I don't have a scan of the section of the paper this comes from, but here's the rough translation I wrote into my notes: If $f(x)$ is an entire function, $S$ is the circle $|S|\le\gamma,$ the transform $T$ is the domain $|\log z|\le\gamma,$ and the transfinite diameter $\tau$ grows with $\gamma$ and is equal to 1 for $\gamma=\gamma_0=0.843\ldots,$ then [the desired result obtains.] I did not write out the proof (or a translation) but it said very little, essentially just that $\gamma_0$ was what you got when you set the transfinite diameter to 1.

894424,Radon-Riesz & Kadec-Klee,"Let us say that a normed vector space has the a) RR (Radon-Riesz) property if for any sequence, norm convergence is equivalent to weak convergence + convergence of norms. b) KK (Kadec-Klee) property if the weak topology coincides with the norm topology on the unit sphere. Observations: o) Property b) implies property a). o) A locally uniformly convex space has a). Questions: i) Is the terminology appropriate? ii) Are the two properties equivalent? iii) If not ii), give a counterexample. Example: The sequence space $\ell_1$ has property a); in fact it has the stronger Schur property . It is also has property b): Since the norm topology is finer than the weak topology, we only need to show that if $x$ is in the restriction $P := U \cap S$ of a norm open set $U$ to the unit sphere $S$,
then $x$ is contained in the restriction $Q := W \cap S$ of a weakly open set $W$ to $S$, and $Q \subset P$. Wlog, $U$ is a small ball of radius $\epsilon > 0$, so that $P = \{ y \in S : |x - y|_1 < \epsilon \}$, and wlog $Q = \{ y \in S : \forall f \in F :  |f(x-y)| < \delta \}$, where $F \subset \ell_\infty$ is finite and $\delta > 0$. Now we can partition the indices $x = a + b$ (into a finite and an infinite part) such that $|b|_1 < \epsilon/4$, with the same partition for any $y = p + q$. Then $|x - y|_1 > \epsilon$ implies $|a - p|_1 \geq \epsilon / 4$. So take $\delta := \epsilon / 4$, and $F$ as the sequences $f$ that have all combinations of $\pm1$ on the support of $a$ and zero outside. Then $|a - p|_1 \geq \epsilon / 4$ implies $|f(x - y)| \geq \delta$ for some $f \in F$. Hence $y \not\in P$ implies $y \not\in Q$, or $Q \subset P$.","['banach-spaces', 'general-topology', 'weak-convergence', 'normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
894426,Derivative of determinant of symmetric matrix wrt a scalar,"For a given square symmetric invertible matrix $\mathbf{X}$ and scalar $\alpha$ (such that the entries of $\mathbf{X}$ depend on $\alpha$), I would like to use the following well-known expression for the derivative of the determinant wrt a scalar (e.g. see wikipedia ): $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \det(\mathbf{X}) = \det(\mathbf{X}) \operatorname{tr} \left( \mathbf{X}^{-1} \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial \alpha} \right) $$ However, I am concerned that this expression may not apply when there exists any kind of special ""structure"" in the matrix (e.g. an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix contains fewer than $n^2$ independent entries). Consider for a moment another situation, where such structure matters: differentiating the determinant wrt the matrix entries (instead of a scalar). First, let $\mathbf{Y}$ be a square invertible ""unstructured"" matrix (i.e. all elements are independent). It is well-known (e.g. see The Matrix Cookbook section 2.1.2, or wikipedia ) that, in this case: $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{Y}} \det(\mathbf{Y}) = \det(\mathbf{Y}) \, (\mathbf{Y}^{-1})^T $$ Now consider $\mathbf{X}$ again, a square symmetric matrix. In this case, the entries are no longer independent (as described in The Matrix Cookbook , beginning of section 2.8), so we have instead (see section 2.8.2 for the symmetric case): $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}} \det(\mathbf{X}) = \det(\mathbf{X}) \, (2 \mathbf{X}^{-1} - (\mathbf{X}^{-1} \circ \mathbf{I})) $$ So, when differentiating the determinant wrt matrix entries, the matrix structure clearly matters. Here is my question: when differentiating a matrix determinant wrt a scalar, does the matrix structure matter? And if so, what is the correct expression for $\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \det(\mathbf{X})$ for the specific case where $\mathbf{X}$ is symmetric?","['trace', 'matrices', 'matrix-calculus', 'derivatives', 'determinant']"

894489,Questions on Fubini's Theorem and $\sigma$-finite measure?,"I asked a question about this a several days ago, but I think I have a better formulated question now.  The reason I did not just edit the last question about this is that I feel the answers I got were helpful, and this time around I have more detail to add. So, if $(X \times Y, \overline{\Sigma \times \tau}, \lambda)$ is a complete measure space, with $\lambda = \mu \times \nu$, then, if $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, Fubini's theorem gives us:  $\int \limits_{X \times Y} f \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X} \left [ \int \limits_{Y} f \,d\nu \right ] \,d\mu$.  We did not need to assume the space was $\sigma$-finite, because $f \geq 0$ being in $L^{1}(d\lambda)$ allowed us to construct a monotonically increasing sequence of simple functions supported on sets of finite measure which converge to $f$. But, my professor said that $\sigma$-finiteness is hidden in the hypothesis of Fubini's theorem.  Specifically, we proved that the following are equivalent: $\exists f > 0$ measurable such that $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$ $\iff$ $\lambda$ is $\sigma$-finite This statement was easy to prove.  Then, my professor said that when we are looking at $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, we have $\int \limits_{X \times Y} f \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X \times Y} f \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda$, and the measure given by $\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda$ is $\sigma$-finite.  This is because the positive part of $f$, $f^{+}$, is in $L^{1}( \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda)$. Question 1: Okay, clearly $f^{+}$ is strictly positive, and also measurable with respect to $\lambda$.  How do I know that it is measurable with respect to $\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda$? Also how would I show that $f^{+} \in L^{1}( \chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda)$?  I need to show that $\int \limits_{X} f^{+} \,d(\chi_{ \{x \mid f(x) \neq 0 \} }\,d\lambda) < \infty$.  I'm not sure how. Question 2: Since we have the above equivalence for $\sigma$-finite measures, given any measure space and any measure $\lambda$, if $f\in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, then the map $f \chi_{ \{ x \mid f(x) > 0 \} }$ is a positive measurable function in $L^{1}(d\lambda)$. So any measure space is $\sigma$-finite by this argument... But that can't be true.  What is wrong with the argument?

894542,Can a function have a strict local extremum at each point?,"A problem given in Spivak's Calculus text is to show that a function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ cannot have a strict local maximum at each point. I will sketch the proof below the fold. My question is: can a function $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ have a strict local extremum at each point, perhaps a combination of strict local minima and maxima? If there did exist such a function, the sets $\{x: x\text{ a strict local maximum}\}$ and $\{x: x\text{ a strict local minimum}\}$ must both be dense, since if not, once we get our hands on an interval which contains only one type of extremum, the proof goes forward as before. Addendum: Such a function, if it were to exist, could not be continuous on any nonempty open set, because I claim a continuous function with a local (non-strict) extremum at each point must be a constant, which is a contradiction, because a constant function has no strict extrema. Proof that $f:[a,b]$ cannot have a strict local max at each point : Suppose $f$ is such a function. take any point $x_1$ in $[a,b]$ and surround it with an interval $[a_1,b_1]$ such that $0<b_1-a_1< \frac12 (b-a)$ such that $f(x)<f(x_1)$ for all $x\in [a_1,b_1]$. Now take any point in $[a_1,b_1]$ and get an interval $[a_2,b_2]$, again reducing the length by at least half, and so on. These intervals must have a common point $p$, which cannot be a local maximum, since it has points $x_i$ arbitrarily close to it such that $f(x)>p$.","['calculus', 'compactness']"

If anyone knows how to do an umlaut in text mode let me know (Thank you Hans Lundmark and miracle173). Most people on this site will be familiar with the phrase Vieta Jumping , which is part of what Hurwitz was doing (1907). Let's see, I believe I have abstracted out the number theory part to a great extent, a proof for what is left establishes the conjecture in the earlier question for all $n.$ That is, i think this stuff is true (with worse constants) for real numbers, all at least $1,$ the same strange quadratic inequality. Note that, if we put no upper bound on $x_1,$ allowing it to grow without bound but keeping the others fixed, the left hand side is eventually larger than any fixed multiple of the right hand side, as the left is quadratic in $x_1$ while the right is linear in $x_1.$ The strange upper bound is the whole story. BACK OF BACKGROUND. After the paper on the Markov Numbers appeared, Hurwitz decided to investigate $$  x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 = a x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n $$  with complete success. For each fixed $n$ and $a,$ there are a finite number of fundamental solutions defined by taking only the solutions that satisfy an inequality. For each such fundamental solution, there is an entire tree of solutions, and tree traversal from one solution to a neighbor or Nachbarn is by Vieta Jumping in a single one of the variables. A fundamental solution is one for which any immediate neighbor has all entries at least as large as the originals; he refers to minimizing the height or Höhe $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n.$ For $n \leq 13$ there is at most one Grundlösung for a given $(n,a),$ but there are two for $n=14, a=1.$ Fairly complete description and reference at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/84927/conjecture-on-markov-hurwitz-diophantine-equation","['inequality', 'number-theory']"

converges, it suffices to show that $$ \int_{\pi}^{\infty} \left| \frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x $$ diverges. We can use $$\int_{\pi}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x = \left[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_{2n\pi}^{(2n+1)\pi} \frac{\sin t}{t} \, \mathrm{d}t \right] - \left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{(2n+1)\pi}^{2(n+1)\pi} \frac{\sin \omega}{\omega} \,\mathrm{d}\omega \right] $$ With the substitution $x = t - 2n\pi \implies \mathrm{d}t = \mathrm{d}x$,
$$\int_{2n\pi}^{(2n+1)\pi} \frac{\sin t}{t} \,\mathrm{d}t = \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{\sin x}{x + 2n\pi} \,\mathrm{d}x $$ and, with the substitution $x = \omega - (2n+1)\pi \implies \mathrm{d}\omega = \mathrm{d}x$, $$ \int_{(2n+1)\pi}^{2(n+1)\pi} \frac{\sin \omega}{\omega}\,\mathrm{d}\omega = -\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\sin x}{x + (2n+1)\pi}\,\mathrm{d} x$$, then, $$\int_{\pi}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x = \left[\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin x\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x + 2n\pi} \,\,\mathrm{d}x\right] + \left[\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x + (2n+1)\pi} \,\, \mathrm{d}x\right]$$ Since $x \in [0,\pi]$, both $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x + 2n\pi}}$ and $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x + (2n+1)\pi}}$ diverge, then the integral
$$\int_{\pi}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x $$
 diverges. Therefore, the integral
$$ \int_{1}^{\infty} \left| \frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x $$
will do so. $\square$ Edit: 08-12-14 at 00:38 Does this make the proof better in any way? $$\int_{\pi}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\sin x}{x} \right| \,\mathrm{d}x = \left[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\sin x}{x+2n\pi}\,\mathrm{d}x \right] + \left[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\sin x}{x+(2n+1)\pi}\,\mathrm{d}x \right]$$ Since $\forall\,x \in [0, \pi] \,\, \sin x \ge 0$, $n \ge 1$ and $ \dfrac{1}{\pi\left(2n+1\right)}\le \dfrac{1}{x + 2n\pi} \le \dfrac{1}{2n\pi} \,\, \forall\,x\in [0,\pi]$ we have $$ \underbrace{\dfrac{\sin x}{\pi\left(2n+1\right)}\le \dfrac{\sin x}{x + 2n\pi}}_{\text{(I)}} \le \dfrac{\sin x}{2n\pi} \,\, \forall\,x\in [0,\pi] $$ Integrating (I) from $0$ to $\pi$, we get
$$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{\sin x}{x + 2n\pi}\,\mathrm{d}x \ge \frac{2}{\pi} \frac{1}{2n+1} $$ Adding all the terms in $n$ and noting  that the series $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n+1}}$ diverges, we conclude that the term between the first brackets blows up as $n \to \infty$. A similar procedure may be used to see what happens to the term between the other brackets, which will diverge also. Then, I think we can conclude more convincingly that the integral diverges.

If you can just give me the name of the technique on how to solve for $y$ or how to setup the integral beforehand so I do not get a $y^2$ on the R.H.S that would also be sufficient. Also, most of the example online are simple so I am wondering if there are cases, in general, where we integrate and $y$ is not explicitly defined, such as this one? and can they solved through algebraic manipulation? Or is the function just numerically estimated? Thank you for your insight!",['ordinary-differential-equations']
894649,Closed form for integral of integer powers of Sinc function,"( Edit: Thank you Vladimir for providing the references for the closed form value of the integrals. My revised question is then to how to derive this closed form.) For all $n\in\mathbb{N}^+$, define $\mathcal{I}_n$ by the definite integral,
  $$\mathcal{I}_n:=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^n{(x)}}{x^n}\mathrm{d}x.$$
  Prove that $\mathcal{I}_n$ has the following closed form:
  $$\mathcal{I}_n\stackrel{?}=\pi\,2^{-n}\left(n\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{(-2)^k(n-2k)^{n-1}}{k!(n-k)!}\right),~~\forall n\in\mathbb{N}^+.$$ Integrals of small positive integer powers of the $\operatorname{sinc}$ function come up on a regular basis here, but it occurred to me that while I probably know the derivations for the $1\le n\le 4$ cases like the back of my hand, I can't recall ever working the integrals wfor any value of $n$ higher than that. The values of the first four integrals are, $$\mathcal{I}_1=\frac{\pi}{2},\\
\mathcal{I}_2=\frac{\pi}{2},\\
\mathcal{I}_3=\frac{3\pi}{8},\\
\mathcal{I}_4=\frac{\pi}{3}.$$ So I set out to first calculate $\mathcal{I}_5$ to see if any obvious pattern jumped out (and see if the trend of being equal to rational multiples of $\pi$ continued). I wound up getting frustrated and asking WolframAlpha instead. It turns that while the first four cases hinted very much at the possibility of a simple pattern relating the values of $\mathcal{I}_n$ for different positive integers $n$ (or possibly two separate patterns for even and odd $n$), the next few values most definitely did not: $$\mathcal{I}_5=\frac{115\pi}{384},\\
\mathcal{I}_6=\frac{11\pi}{40},\\
\mathcal{I}_7=\frac{5887\pi}{23040}\\
\mathcal{I}_8=\frac{151\pi}{630}.$$ So my questions are, 1) is there a systematic way to compute these integrals for all $n$?; and 2) is there an elegant way to represent these values in closed form for general $n$?","['improper-integrals', 'closed-form', 'special-functions', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"
894661,Is this proof for area of a circle correct?,I want to prove that the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$. so I calculated the area of a regular polygon with $n$ sides. It consists of $n$ triangles with height of $r \cos(\frac{\pi}{n})$ and base of $2r \sin(\frac{\pi}{n})$ so : $$S=2r^2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}r^2\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$$ $$A=nS$$ $S$ is the area of each triangle and $A$ is the area of the polygon. and when $n\rightarrow \infty$ $$A=n\left(\frac{1}{2}r^2\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\right)=n\left(\frac{1}{2}r^2\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$$ $$A=\pi r^2$$ Is it correct ?,"['geometry', 'limits']"
894679,"""Rank-K Correction"" of a matrix and significance?","Today my studies led me to read about the matrix inversion lemma , which Wikipedia introduces as follows: In mathematics (specifically linear algebra), the Woodbury matrix identity, named after Max A. Woodbury[1][2] says that the inverse of a rank-k correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a rank-k correction to the inverse of the original matrix. After some searching I couldn't find any explanation of the terminology rank-$k$ correction , but I did find a Wikipedia article about the BFGS algorithm that uses the same term: Instead, the Hessian matrix is approximated using rank-one updates specified by gradient evaluations...  the approximate Hessian at stage $k$ is updated by the addition of two matrices $$B_{k+1} = B_k + U_k + V_k$$ Both $U_k$ and $V_k$ are symmetric rank-one matrices... [and together] construct a rank-two update matrix... As far as I can tell from these sources, a rank-$k$ correction of matrix $A$ consists of the addition of a matrix $B$ of rank $k$ to $A$. However, it is unclear to me what exactly the reason is for describing matrix addition in this way.  Can someone help me understand the implications and applications of this terminology at a basic level, as well as its importance to optimization problems?","['optimization', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"
894686,Solving $4y^4 - 4x^4 + x + y = 0$ (equation system of partial derivates),"I need help solving the following equation system:
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} = 8xy + 4y^2 + \frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} = 0 $$ $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} = 8xy + 4x^2 - \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} = 0 $$ I've managed to simplify this down to the following:
$$ 4x^4 - 4y^4 + x + y \Leftrightarrow 4x^4 + x = 4y^4 - y $$ But I can't find a way to separate the $x$ or $y$. Wolfram-Alpha says the solution is $y = -x$, and I'm assuming there must be some simple trick (creating a square etc) to find that solution since I very much doubt solving a general 4th degree equation is part of this particular problem, but I just can't figure out how. The full problem is from an exercise in my course book in multivariable calculus, I'll post the whole problem below if it turns out I missed something essential in the problem statement. Please help, it's extremely frustrating to get stuck on this subproblem which really has nothing to do with calculus at all. If there is some trick that can be applied to solve this particular equation I very much would like to know and never get stuck like this again.

894704,An outrageous way to derive a Laurent series: why does this work?,"I had to compute a series expansion of $1/(e^{x}-1)$ about $x=0$, and in the course of its derivation, I made a couple of manipulations that are not allowed mathematically. Still, comparing the final result against Maple showed that it was right. The following is what I did: \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{e^{x}-1} &= \frac{e^{-x}}{1-e^{-x}} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-nx} \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(-nx)^{k}}{\Gamma(k+1)}\\
&= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{x^{k}}{\Gamma(k+1)}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{k}\\
&= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{\zeta(-k)}{\Gamma(k+1)} x^{k}\\
&= \sum_{k=-1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{\zeta(-k)}{\Gamma(k+1)} x^{k}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
I naively exchanged the order of summation to obtain the third line. Then, I pretended that the summation over $n$ converged (i.e., as if $k$ were always smaller than -1), and replaced it by the Riemann zeta function. Notice that whenever $1/\Gamma(k+1) = 0$ , the coefficient of $x^{k}$ vanishes except when $k=-1$, for which the poles of gamma and zeta functions cancel out and give a finite value. I suppose that there is a deeper reason that such unreliable steps led me to the correct result? My guess is that it has to do with the analytic structure of the summand as a function of $k$, but I haven't been able to figure out in detail why and when this works. I'll appreciate any insights on this.","['laurent-series', 'riemann-zeta', 'complex-analysis', 'fake-proofs']"
894724,Finitely many embeddings of a finite extension in an algebraic closure,"So I'm reading through Lang's Algebra , and he keeps saying something along the following lines: ""Let $K$ be a finite extension of a field $k$ and let $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r$ be the distinct embeddings of $K$ in an algebraic closure $k^\text{a}$ of $k$."" But the thing is that it doesn't seem clear to me that there need be only finitely many distinct embeddings, and I can't find anywhere where he proves it or figure out why it should be true or find its proof anywhere else. I feel like it should be obvious but it's not. So can anyone explain this to me? EDIT: This all certainly makes more sense to me now. The only problem is that all of the answers make use of the minimal polynomial, which (as far as I know) only applies to algebraic finite extensions. I'm willing to believe that Lang is talking about algebraic extensions, but I do wonder if this is true of finite extensions in general.
