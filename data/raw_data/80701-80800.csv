1044550,"Show that for any subset $C\subseteq Y$, one has $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) = X \setminus f^{-1}(C)$ [duplicate]","This question already has an answer here : How to approach proving $f^{-1}(B\setminus C)=A\setminus f^{-1}(C)$? (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . Let $f: X\rightarrow Y$ be a map Show that for any subset $C\subseteq Y$, one has $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) = X \setminus f^{-1}(C)$ In this case $f^{-1}$ refers to preimage I started off with trying to show $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) \subseteq X \setminus f^{-1}(C)$ Let $ x\in f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) \Rightarrow x \in f^{-1}(Y), x\notin f^{-1}(C)\Rightarrow x\in X, x\notin f^{-1}(C) \Rightarrow x\in X \setminus f^{-1}(C) \Rightarrow f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) \subseteq X \setminus f^{-1}(C) $ Then I tried to show $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) \supseteq X \setminus f^{-1}(C)$ Let $ x \in X\setminus f^{-1}(C) \Rightarrow x \in X, x \notin f^{-1}(C)$ and since $ C \subseteq Y$ ,if $ x\notin f^{-1}(C)$ , $x$ must be in $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C)$ , so $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) \supseteq X \setminus f^{-1}(C)$.

1044551,Number of flips to get to a Set of Positive Lebesgue Measure,"A consequence of Exercise 1.1.19 on page 13 of Stroock's ""Probability Theory: An Analytic View"" is that if a set $E\subset[0,1)$ has positive (Lebesgue) measure, then for almost every $x\in[0,1)$, a finite number of flips of its binary expansion will move $x$ to $E$. The exercise in Stroock suggests using the Kolmogorov 0-1 Law but it can also also be proved measure theoretically using an open cover approximation of $E$. I read and did this a long time ago but when thinking of something else recently, I wondered Given a set of positive measure, what is the expected number of flips required? (No clue.) Is the expected value finite? (I think so but I don't have a proof.) Even for a set that is a finite union of dyadic intervals, it is not clear to me what the expected value is. For example, what is the maximum of the expected value over the collection of $E\subset[0,1)$ that is a finite union of dyadic intervals with measure 0.5? I would appreciate it if someone can give me a reference if this is well known or some hint on how to do this if it is reasonably doable for someone who knows some measure theory (say at the level of Folland, Royden, or Rudin.)","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'probability', 'real-analysis']"

(Historical Question),"I know Riemann surfaces are actually algebraic curves, i.e. all Riemann surfaces can be simply embedded into some projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. But this doesn't indicate me more correspondences between analytic functions and algebraic functions.
(For example, holomorphic 1-forms and regular 1-forms.) On the other hand, I learn such correspondences from Serre's GAGA. This is valid for projective varieties of any dimensions, but were there such theorems for Riemann surfaces (before GAGA)? Or, GAGA had an impact for just the case of Riemann surfaces?",['algebraic-geometry']
1044566,Some questions on applying Stokes' theorem,"Let $\omega$ be a differential form. Stokes' theorem states that for any manifold $\Omega$: $$ \int_{\partial \Omega}\omega = \int_\Omega d\omega$$ where $d$ is the exterior derivative. I would like to use Stokes' theorem to prove that a given differential $1$-form $\varphi$ is exact whenever its integral over a closed curve is zero. My idea is to let $\Omega$ be a closed curve. Then $\partial \Omega = \varnothing$ and therefore $\int_{\partial \Omega}\omega =0$. By Stokes' theorem then $ \int_\Omega d\omega=0$. The problem I have now is that this shows that the integral over a closed curve of $d \omega$ is zero but this doesn't seem to help. Hence: How can I use Stokes' theorem to find a differential $0$-form $\psi$
  with $d \psi = \varphi$?","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"
1044587,Composition of relations. Both relations are functional and mutually inverse mappings.

Show that if the relations $\mathcal{R}_1\subset X\times Y$ and $\mathcal{R}_2 \subset Y \times X$ are such that $(\mathcal{R}_2 \circ \mathcal{R}_1=\Delta_X)\wedge(\mathcal{R}_1 \circ \mathcal{R}_2 = \Delta_Y)$ , then both relations are functional and define mutually inverse mappings of $X$ and $Y$ . I will try to solve this below, but first I must note, this is from Zorich - Mathematical Analysis I, page 22, Exercise 1.3.5, Q1a). Furthermore, I do not condone such long questions. My attempt: What does it mean for a relation to be functional? $$(x \R y_1) \wedge (x \R y_2 ) \implies ( y_1 = y_2)$$ This qualifies the relation as a function. What does it mean for two relations to define mutually inverse mappings of $X$ and $Y$ . Since the relations are functions(if the above does hold), then to satisfy this we need: $$f:X\to Y, G: Y\to X \text{ to have: }$$ $$g \circ f = e_X, f \circ g = e_Y$$ Where $e_X$ and $e_Y$ are the identity mappings on $X$ and $Y$ respectively.","['relations', 'analysis']"

1044834,Integral of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-x}}dx$,"For a differential equation I have to solve the integral $\frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-x}}$. I eventually have to write the solution in the form $ x = ...$ It doesn't matter if I solve the integral myself or if I use a table to find the integral.

$$\frac{dx}{\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \ln \left|2ax + b +2\sqrt{a\left({ax^2+bx+c}\right)}\right|$$

All I know is that $x<0$ which does not seem to help me either (the square root will only be real if $x<-1$).

1044862,"In $\mathsf{Rel}$, are any two objects isomorphic?","My knowledge of categories is rather basic, and I was just trying to find out what isomorphisms are in $\mathsf{Rel}$ where objects are sets and morphisms are relations. As far as I got, an isomorphism in $\mathsf{Rel}$ is any binary relation which is both left-total and right-total (projections on either factor set is that set), hence any two objects are isomorphic e.g. by a trivial relation. Am I missing something? In general, if all the objects in some category are isomorphic, is there any interest in studying such category? The question arises for the reason that a lot of constructions in category theory (such as products) are defined up to isomorphism. Edit: I did not put definitions of identity and composition in the OP as I thought that $\mathsf{Rel}$ is a pretty classical category -  at least google returns two top pages, Wikipedia and n-Lab, both providing necessary information. FWIW, by an identity I mean a diagonal of a set (equality relation) whereas the composition of two relations is as follows: for $R:X\to Y$ and $S:Y\to Z$ $$
  S\circ R = \{(x,z): \exists y\in Y \text{ s.t. }(x,y)\in R \text{ and }(y,z)\in S\}.
$$ I say that $R$ is left (respectively right) total whenever $\pi_X(R) = X$ (respectively $\pi_Y(R) = Y)$ . Going over the example proposed by @Amitai, I realized that my conditions imply $\mathrm{id}_X \subseteq R^{-1}\circ R$ , but I've missed the fact that the RHS can be strictly bigger. Checking the isomorphism conditions thoroughly, I've found out that in $\mathsf{Rel}$ the isomorphisms are exactly graphs of bijections, hence isomorphic sets must be of the same cardinality - that was the guess I had in the beginning. Nevertheless, I'm still interested in my second question above: is that of any interest to study a category where all objects are isomoprhic, besides of treating this as a monoid? For example, as far as I understood the category of groupoids has all morphisms being isomorphisms.","['relations', 'category-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"

All notions are up to null sets. Definitions Given a finite measure space $\mu(\Omega)<\infty$ and a Banach space $E$. Consider plain functions $F:\Omega\to E$. Denote the Bochner measurable functions by $\mathcal{B}$. Define the Bochner integral by:
$$F\in\mathcal{B}:\quad\int F\mathrm{d}\mu:=\lim_n\int S_n\mathrm{d}\mu$$
for simple functions satisfying:
$$\int\|F-S_n\|\mathrm{d}\mu\to0$$
Denote the Bochner integrable functions by $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{B}$. Define the generalized Riemann integral by:
$$\int_\mathfrak{R}F\mathrm{d}\mu:=\lim_\mathcal{P}\{\sum_{a\in A\in\mathcal{P}}F(a)\mu(A)\}_\mathcal{P}$$
over finite measurable partitions:
$$\mathcal{P}\subseteq\Sigma:\quad\Omega=\bigsqcup_{A\in\mathcal{P}}A\quad(\#\mathcal{P}<\infty)$$
being ordered by refinement:
$$\mathcal{P}\leq\mathcal{P}':\iff\forall A'\in\mathcal{P}'\exists A\in\mathcal{P}:\quad A\supseteq A'$$
Denote Riemann integrable functions by $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{R}$. Problem Clearly, boundedness is a necessary condition for Riemann integrability:
$$f:(0,1]\to\mathbb{R}:x\mapsto\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}:\quad f\in\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{B},\,f\notin\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{R}$$ However, there are also bounded Riemann integrable functions that are not Bochner integrable:
$$F:[0,1]\to\ell^2[0,1]:t\mapsto\chi_t:\quad F\notin\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{B},\,F\in\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{R}$$ Moreover, both strictly include the uniform integral:
$$\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{U}\subsetneq\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{B}\land\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{U}\subsetneq\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{R}$$ So the remaining question is wether at least for the bounded case:
  $$\|F\|_\infty<\infty:\quad F\in\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{B}\implies F\in\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{R}$$

For this, I used cylindrical coordinates to parametrize the region: $$x=r\cos \theta$$
$$y=r\sin \theta$$
$$z=z$$ Since $x^2+y^2=z^2$ then $r=z$. And since $x^2+y^2=ax$ then $r=a\cos \theta$. So the final parameterization, for $-\pi/2<\theta<\pi/2$ and $0<r<a\cos \theta$, is: $$x=r\cos \theta$$
$$y=r\sin \theta$$
$$z=r$$ And so, $T_r =(\cos\theta,\sin\theta,1)$ and $ T_{\theta}=(-r\sin\theta ,r \cos\theta, 0)$. Which gives  $T_r \times T_{\theta}=(-r\cos\theta, -rsin\theta, r^2)$ And so the area is given by: $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \int_0^{a \cos\theta}r(1+r^2)^{1/2} dr d\theta$$ Which seems simple, but gives a hell-difficult integral when integrating respect to $\theta$.

1045558,Deriving a recurrence equation and apply Master's Thrm to it,"So for a function such as: function Hi(n)

Hi(n/2) It's very easy to eyeball this and get a recurrence of: T(n) = 3(n/2) + n And then applying Master's Theorem to get its Big Ɵ is also very straightforward. But what confuses me is what do I do when there's some code after the recursive calls and the base case happens are n < (some number greater than 1), like this: Function PrintZs (integer n)
    if n < 3
        print(“Z”)

        PrintZs(n/3)

Then when I apply master's theorem to this problem, I will treat the equation as: T(n) = 3T(n/3) + 2n Since that 1 print call in the if statement is irrelevant to the 2n print calls that happen every call to the function (where n >= 3).

Prove that $I$ is prime. Here is my strategy thusfar.  Suppose $xy \in I$.  Ultimately, it seems the goal is to find ideals $I_x \ni x$ and $I_y \ni y$ such that $I = I_x \cap I_y$.

Generally, $I_x I_y \subset I_x \cap I_y$, but the two are equal if $I_x + I_y = R$. So I thought I might be able to use $(2)$ somehow to prove $I + (x) + (y) = R$.

​​  of a year after January 1.
Find the formula of the trigonometric function that models the daily low temperature $T$ in Guangzhou t years after January 1, 2015. Define the function using radians. $T(t)=$ So the steps I took are: 1) Finding the amplitude:
$$\frac { 78-49 }{ 2 } =14.5$$ 2) Finding the midline: 
$$\frac { 78+49 }{ 2 } =63.5$$ 3) Figuring out whether to use cosine or sine: I figured that I can treat July 26th as the beginning of the year and then shift the function to make it the 206th day of the year. So I used cosine. Since at $0$, a cosine function is at its max value. 4) The period:
$1$ year is a period so it must be $$\frac { 2\pi  }{ 365 } $$ 5) The function without the shift is now:
$$14.5cos(\frac { 2\pi  }{ 365 } u)+63.5$$ 6) Now I must find the value of $u$ in order to properly shift the function. I imagine that this must be $t-206$ since it is $206$ days after January 1.

1046040,Integrating a function of measures,"I've been reading John Baez's series of posts on Information Geometry. I'm currently on part 6 ... Midway through the post he discusses Radon-Nikodym derivatives: The formula for information gain looks more slick: $$\int_\Omega \log\left(\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\right)d\mu$$ And by the way, in case you’re wondering, the $d$ here doesn’t actually mean much: we’re just so brainwashed into wanting a $dx$ in our integrals that people often use $d\mu$ for a measure even though the simpler notation $\mu$ might be more logical. So, the function $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$ is really just a ratio of probability measures, but people call it a Radon-Nikodym derivative, because it looks like a derivative (and in some important examples it actually is). So, if I were talking to myself, I could have shortened this blog entry immensely by working with directly probability measures, leaving out the $d$'s, and saying: Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are probability measures; then the entropy of $\mu$ relative to $\nu$, or information gain, is $$S(\mu,\nu) = \int_\Omega \log\left(\frac{\mu}{\nu}\right)\mu$$ I understand the integral when formulated as (a log of) the Radon-Nikodym derivative... since that's just a function on elements of $\Omega$, the integral is just the Lebesgue integral with respect to $d\mu$. However, I don't understand how the second integral is defined... $\log\left(\frac{\mu}{\nu}\right)$ isn't a function of elements of $\Omega$, but if anything of subsets of $\Omega$ (and it clearly isn't itself a measure). What's the right way of thinking about this integral? Intuitively, my first instinct is to break $\Omega$ into a bunch of disjoint subsets whose maximum measure according to $\mu$ is bounded, and take the limit of a sum over these sets as the bound decreases. Let's say for now all the measures involved are dominated by Lebesgue measure. Something like: Let $A_i$ be a set of subsets of $\Omega$ such that $\cup_i A_i = \Omega$ $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ when $i \ne j$ $\max_i \mu(A_i) < \varepsilon$ Then
$$
\int_\Omega \log\left(\frac{\mu}{\nu}\right)\mu \equiv \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \sum_i \log\left(\frac{\mu(A_i)}{\nu(A_i)}\right)\mu(A_i)
$$ Clearly that isn't terribly rigorous, but is this on the right track conceptually? Or am I just deeply confused?","['probability-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

I think I might be understanding counting measure incorrectly, because it seems to me that $m \ll \mu$ is not true, because any Borel subset of the open interval $(0, 1)$ would have counting measure zero because it does not contain any integers, but clearly could have positive Lebesgue measure.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

1046147,Understanding the stack $B\mathbb{Z}$,"Here, let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the group scheme whose functor of points is the constant functor which takes a connected affine scheme to the group $\mathbb{Z}$.  I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the stack $B\mathbb{Z}$, in particular quasicoherent sheaves on it. Here's how I want to approach $BG$ for $G$ say an affine algebraic group.  One can take a smooth atlas $f: * \rightarrow BG$ and apply Barr-Beck to find that the category of coalgebras over the comonad $f^* f_*$ is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on $BG$.  One can use smooth base change ($f$ is smooth and thus flat, also separated and finite type, everything is noetherian I think) and see that this comonad is the same as $g_* g^*$ for $g: G \rightarrow *$.  Then a coalgebra is a vector space $V$ (let's say everything is over a field of char 0) which is a comodule for $\mathcal{O}_G$ (ring of global functions).  If $V^*$ is finite-dimensional then we can take symmetric powers and spectrum and get an algebraic action $G \times V^* \rightarrow V^*$ -- here we need that $G$ is affine.  Thus a coherent sheaf on $BG$ is a vector space with a rational action of $G$.  (Is the above correct?  I understand there's also some argument involving Hopf duals, but I'm not sure there's a good analogue for the group ring for $G$ not finite.) For $G$ not affine (e.g. $G = \mathbb{Z}$, or maybe $G$ an ind-scheme like $\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a$), do we have a way to understand (coherent sheaves on) these objects? Edit: Extra question.  In the above, I had to assume that $V$ as finite-dimensional, in order for a coaction $k[V] \rightarrow k[V] \otimes k[G]$ to give a rational/algebraic action.  If $V$ is infinite-dimensional (i.e. quasicoherent sheaf instead of coherent sheaf), I'm also not really sure how to proceed.","['algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-groups']"
