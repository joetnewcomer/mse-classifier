2489249,Poincare-type inequality on ball.,"Let $B_r$ be an open ball in $\Bbb R^d$ with radius $r$. Let $u\in W^{1,p}(B_r)$ and define
$
\bar u=\frac 1{|B_r|}\int u\ dx,
$
so that by Poincare inequality we have 
$$
||u-\bar u||_{L^p(B_r)} \le C||Du ||_{L^p(B_r)}\quad;\quad C=C(r,p).
$$ Actually, $C(r,p)=C(p)\cdot r$ by dilating $B_r$ to $B_1$ and change of variables. Now, by Sobolev embedding we have $W^{1,p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^q(\Omega)$ for $q\in [1,\frac{dp}{d-p}]$, i.e.
$$
||u||_{L^q} \le C'||u||_{W^{1,p}}\quad;\quad C'=C'(\Omega,p,q,d).
$$ Combining these we can easily get
$$
||u-\bar u||_{L^q(B_r)} \le C'' ||Du||_{L^p(B_r)}
$$
for some constant $C''$ depending on $r,p,q,d$. However, I've seen a version that says
  $$
\left(\frac 1{|B_r|}\int |u-\bar u|^q \right)^{1/q} \le Cr \left(\frac 1{|B_r|}\int |Du|^p \right)^{1/p}
$$
  where $C=C(d,p,q)$ does not depend on $r$. Is that an easy consequence of the above or does it require another approach entirely? I tried scaling argument but the term $||u||_p$ and $||Du||_p$ in $||u||_{W^{1,p}}$ scale differently.

2489328,$n$ people $n$ hats: probability that at most $m$ $(m\leqslant n)$ people get their own hats!,"This is a variant of the popular $Hat$-problem. Say there are $n$ people and $n$ hats. Then what is the probability that at most $m$ $(m\leqslant n)$ people get their own hats! My solution is $\frac{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{m} {n \choose k}D_{n-k}}{n!}$, where $D_{n-k}$ denotes number of derangements of a set with $n-k$ elements. The argument is that $k$ people, who get their own hats, can be chosen from $n$ people in $n\choose k$ ways and there is only $one$ way that they get their own hats. None of the rest $n-k$ people get their own hats. And hence the derangement factor $D_{n-k}$. Is my argument valid?","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2489382,Limit of a two variable function involving arcsin and arctan,"I recently came across this problem of finding the limit of a function in two variables as we approach the origin, defined as follows: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{\arcsin(x+2y)}{\arctan(2x+4y)}$$ This was on the mid-term test on our course of Multivariable Calculus. While, all the paths that pass through the origin I have tested, seems to give the limit $\frac{1}{2}$, which seems reasonable through recognizing the fact that the argument of arctan is twice as that of arcsin and the logic of single variable limit: $\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\arcsin(x)}{\arctan(2x)}$. It is, however, not sufficient to prove that the limit is indeed, $\frac{1}{2}$ since the two-path test is a test for the non-existence of limit and not the existence of one. I have even tried Sandwich Theorem and evaluating the limit by converting to polar coordinates but have reached to no conclusion, of course. I am wondering if setting (x+2y) as some parameter t followed by tending t to zero would work, but then again that would be the same as testing along the path x=-2y. I am truly dumbfounded by this problem and after long efforts at solving it, I have no answer. Any kind of hint towards which direction I should be proceeding or a solution would be highly appreciated.","['limits', 'trigonometry', 'inverse-function', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus']"
2489395,Irrationality of $\sqrt{15}$,"Could someone verify the correctness of this proof for the irrationality of $\sqrt{15}$? Assume $\sqrt{15}\in\mathbf{Q}$, then $\sqrt{15}=\frac{p}{q}$ with $p,q\in\mathbf{Z}$ ($q\ne0$ and $\gcd(p,q)=1$).
$\implies 15q^2=p^2 \implies 15\mid p^2 \implies 3\mid p^2 \implies 3\mid p$ (Euclid's Lemma) Now we write $p=3k$ for $k\in\mathbf{Z}$, then we have $15q^2=9k^2 \implies 5q^2=3k^2 \implies 3\mid 5q^2$. Since $\gcd(3,5)=1$ (this lemma: if $a\mid bc$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1$ then $a\mid c$) this gives $3\mid q^2 \implies 3\mid q$ (Euclid's Lemma). Therefore $3\mid p$ and $3\mid q$.

2489403,Characterizing duals of cones that are linear images of the positive semidefinite cone,"Let $M_n$ denote the space of $n\times n$ matrices over complex numbers. The space of self-adjoint matrices is denoted 
$$
M_n^{sa} = \{A\in M_n\, :\, A^*=A \},

and the cone of positive semidefinite matrices will be denoted 
$$
 M_n^+ = \{A\in M_n^{sa}\, :\, A\geq0\},
$$
where $A\geq0$ denotes that $A$ is positive semidefinite.
The adjoint of a linear map of matrices $\phi:M_n\rightarrow M_m$ is the unique map $\phi^*:M_m\rightarrow M_n$ that satisfies 
$$
\mathrm{Tr}(\phi(A)B) = \mathrm{Tr}(A\phi^*(B))
$$
for all $A\in M_n$ and $B\in M_m$. The dual cone of a 
subset $S\subseteq M_{n}^{sa}$ is defined by
$$
S^* = \{B\in M_{n}^{sa}\, : \, \forall A\in S, \, \mathrm{Tr}(AB)\geq 0\}
$$
Note that $S^*$ is always a closed and convex cone. Let $\phi$ be a linear map of matrices and consider the cones of self-adjoint matrices defined by
$$
K = \{A\in M_n^{sa} \, :\, \phi(A)\geq 0\}
$$
and 
$$
L= \{\phi^*(B) \, :\, B\geq 0\}.
$$
It is evident that both $K$ and $L$ are both convex cones and that $L\subseteq K^*$ and $K\subseteq L^*$. Question: Is it necessarily the case that $K^*=L$ or $L^*=K$? If not, under what circumstances would it hold that $K^*=L$ or $L^*=K$? For the linear maps $\phi$ that I've played around with so far this seems to be the case and I'm wondering if there is a counterexample.","['matrices', 'semidefinite-programming', 'positive-semidefinite', 'convex-cone', 'dual-cone']"

I have already proven that $\alpha = \iota_Y \omega$ is a contact form where $Y = \frac 12 \sum\limits_{j=1}^n (x_j \partial x_j + y_j \partial y_j)$ is the radial vector field on the sphere. Obviously $Y$ is a Liouville vector field, so one can show easily $\iota_Y \omega$ defines a contact structure. I also proved that the Reeb vector field is $R = 2 \sum_j (x_j \partial y_j - y_j \partial x_j)$ since $\alpha(R) = 1$ and $\iota_R \text d\alpha = 0$.

2489673,Line integral in terms of Lebesgue integral,"Background I have been looking at the line integral and I am wondering why (or even if) it is well-defined in the context of Lebesgue integrals. The definition of wikipedia defines it like this (in terms of Riemann integrals, as far as I can tell): For some scalar field $f:U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve $C \subseteq U$ is defined as $$\int_C f(\mathbf{r}(s)) ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t)) |\mathbf{r}'(t)| dt$$ where $\mathbf{r}:[a,b] \to C$ is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve $C$ such that $\mathbf{r}(a)$ and $\mathbf{r}(b)$ give the endpoints of $C$ and $a<b$. Note that the first integral in the definition is just notation, its meaning is defined in terms of an arbitrary parametrization. In order for the definition to be well-defined, it is important that any choice of parametrization gives the same result. Question If we are working with the Lebesgue integral, an appropriate definition of the line integral seems to be (feel free to suggest an alternative defintion) For Lebesgue measurable $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and Lebesgue measurable function $f:U \to \mathbb{R}$, the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve $C \subseteq U$ is defined as $$\int_C f(\mathbf{r}(s)) ds = \int_{[a,b]} f(\mathbf{r}(t)) |\mathbf{r}'(t)| dt$$ where $\mathbf{r}:[a,b] \to C$ is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve $C$. I relaxed the restriction on $f$ to be any Lebesgue measurable function, and removed the restriction that $\mathbf{r}(a)$ and $\mathbf{r}(b)$ must be endpoints of $C$, because the Lebesgue integral ignores the ""order"" in which we integrate over the space (we still integrate over the whole $C$ because $\mathbf{r}$ is bijective). Again, the first integral is just notation, and the definition of this notation is in terms of an arbitrary parametrization. Is the definition in terms of the Lebesgue integral well-defined? Concretely, these questions come to mind: What should be the interpretation of smooth in these definitions? Suggestion based on the comment by @PaulSinclair: A set is a smooth curve iff it has a bijective parametrization that has continous first-order partial derivatives almost everywhere. Is the definition independent of the parametrization? Is the Lebesgue integral always defined, for any measurable function and any smooth curve? If so, why (proof)? If not, what should I change such that the definition becomes well-defined? If there are any resources on this (books, ...), I am interested in that as well.","['integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'definition']"
2489714,Counting number of filled squares,"recently I came across the following problem:

You colour this square as long as its two adjacent squares aren't coloured yet. To make the problem more intuitive I should probably mention that it is a variant of the classical urinary problem, in which you are given n urinaries and each person choses the urinary that is the furthest apart from all the urinaries that are already used, and in case of equality, you choose the one on the left (closest to the door, for instance).

For example, in the $4\times4\times4$ puzzle the four center stickers on each face are indistinguishable, giving a total of $24^6$ potential ""solved"" configurations. But not all of these are actually possible.

2489756,Examples of modules with non-effective descent data,"Let me first summarise descent data for modules, following the Stacks project : Given a ring homomorphism $R \to A$ we can extend scalars for $R$-modules $V$ to get $A$ modules $A \otimes V$ ($\otimes = \otimes_R$). If $M$ is an $A$-module we can ask whether $M$ arises in this way, i.e. is there an $R$-module $V$ such that $M \cong A \otimes V$? If again $V$ is an $R$-module then there is an $A\otimes A$-linear isomorphism 
$$
T : A \otimes (A \otimes V) \to (A \otimes V) \otimes A

given by $T(a_1 \otimes (a_2 \otimes v)) = (a_1 \otimes v) \otimes a$. Which satisfies a certain cocycle condition. In general, such an $A\otimes A$-linear isomorphism $$T : A \otimes M \to M \otimes A$$ satisfying the cocycle condition is called descent data and there is a straightforward notion of morphisms, so that we have a category of such data $(M,T)$. Let us denote this category $Desc(A/R)$. So extension of scalars forms a functor $Mod_R \to Desc(A/R)$ from the category of $R$-modules to that of descent data. If $R \to A$ is faithfully flat then this functor is an equivalence of categories (cf. the above link).

Hence $\|f_k-f\|<\varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon>0$ $(f_k)\in c_0$ means, that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_k(n)=0$ for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Therefore there is an $N_k(\varepsilon)\in N$ such that for every $n>N(\varepsilon)$ we have $|f_k(n)|<\varepsilon$, for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$ I want to show, that $0$ is a limit of $(f_k)$.
Since $(f_k)$ is a cauchy sequence we have $\|f_k(m)-f_k(m')\|_\infty<\varepsilon$ for every $m,m'>N$ and $f_k(m), f_k(m')\to 0$. Hence $|f_k(m)|<\varepsilon/2$ for every $m>N_m(\epsilon)$ and $|f_k(m')|<\varepsilon/2$ for every $m'>N_m'(\epsilon)$. Now we choose $N(\varepsilon)=\max\{N_m(\varepsilon), N_m'(\varepsilon)\}$ We proceed: $\|f_k(m)-f_k(m')\|_\infty\leq \|f_k(m)\|_\infty+\|f_k(m'\|_\infty\\=\sup_{n\geq m}|f_k(m)|+\sup_{n\geq m'}|f_k(m')|\leq \varepsilon/2+\varepsilon/2=\varepsilon$ I doubt that this is right.

$$E(g(x)-g(a))=\frac{f(g(x))-f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}-f'(g(x))$$ In any case:
$$f(g(x))-f(g(a))=(E(g(x)-g(a))+f'(g(x)))\times(g(x)-g(a))$$ Dividing by $x-a$ and taking the limit we get: $$\begin{align}

My question is under what conditions can that happen? It seems like a fairly special result.

With weak convergence (i.e., $P_n\to P$ weakly if and only if $\mathbb E_{P_n}(f)\to\mathbb E_P(f)$ for every bounded continuous functions $f:\mathcal X\to\mathbb R$), a basis of the corresponding weak topology induced by this weak convergence is a collection of the following sets:
$$U(P,\alpha)=\left\{Q:\left|\int f_idP-\int f_idQ\right|<\alpha,i=1,\ldots,n\right\}$$
for some $P\in\mathcal P$, $f_i$ bounded continuous functions, $n$ is finite, and $\alpha>0$. Then there exists a finite measurable partition $A_1,\ldots,A_m$ of $\mathcal X$ and $\beta>0$ such that
\begin{align}
\tilde{U}(P,\beta)=\{Q:|P(A_j)-Q(A_j)|<\beta\}\subset{U}(P,\alpha).
\end{align} My questions are: is $\tilde{U}(P,\epsilon)$ also open? if not, is there an open set, say $U'(P, \alpha')$, that is contained in $\tilde{U}(P,\beta)$? or under what conditions there exists such a $U'(P, \alpha')$? (might have different bounded continuous functions) Can you help me with these question? or please see my thinking below. Let me first prove the existence of such $\tilde{U}(P,\beta)\subset U(P,\alpha).$ Since $f_i$ is bounded continuous, then there exists a simple function $\tilde f_i$ such that $\|f_i-\tilde f_i\|_{\infty} <\frac{\alpha}{3}$. Then if $|\int \tilde{f}_idP - \int \tilde{f}_idQ|<\frac{\alpha}{3}$, we have 
\begin{align}
&\left|\int f_idP-\int f_idQ\right|\\
=~&\left|\int f_idP-\int \tilde f_idP+\int \tilde f_idP-\int \tilde f_idQ+\int \tilde f_idQ-\int f_idQ\right|\\
<~&\alpha.
\end{align}
We can then define a finite partition according to these simple functions, as $f_i$'s are bounded. By choosing a small enough $\beta$, $|P(A_j)-Q(A_j)|<\beta$ for all $i$ implies $|\int \tilde f_idP-\int \tilde f_idQ|<\frac{\alpha}{3}$. I have no idea about question 1, so I go to question 2, thinking to construct some bounded continuous functions to build a new open set. a). for each measurable set $A_i$, find two continuous functions $\bar{f_i}$ and $\underline{f_i}$, such that 
$$\bar{f_i}(x)\geq I_{A_i}(x)\geq \underline{f_i}(x),~\text{for every $x\in\mathcal X$},$$
$$\int \bar{f_i} dP- \int \underline{f_i}dP<\frac{\beta}{2},$$
where $I_{A_i}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function. b). For any probability measure $Q$, we have $$\int\underline{f_i}dQ\leq Q(A_i)\leq\int\bar{f_i}dQ.$$ Thus, if $|\int\bar{f_i}dP - \int\underline{f_i}dQ|<\beta$ and $|\int\underline{f_i}dP - \int\bar{f_i}dQ|<\beta$, we must have $|P(A_i)-Q(A_i)|<\beta$. We also have
\begin{align}
&\left|\int\underline{f_i}dP - \int\bar{f_i}dQ\right|\\
=~&\left|\int\underline{f_i}dP-\int\bar{f_i}dP+\int\bar{f_i}dP-\int\bar{f_i}dQ \right|\\
\leq~&\left|\int\underline{f_i}dP-\int\bar{f_i}dP\right|+\left|\int\bar{f_i}dP-\int\bar{f_i}dQ \right|
\end{align}
Similarly, we have $$\left|\int\bar{f_i}dP - \int\underline{f_i}dQ\right|\leq\left|\int\bar{f_i}dP-\int\underline{f_i}dP\right|+\left|\int\underline{f_i}dP-\underline{f_i}dQ \right|$$ As such, adding the following constraints $$\left|\int\underline{f_i}dP-\underline{f_i}dQ \right|<\frac{\beta}{2}, \left|\int\bar{f_i}dP-\bar{f_i}dQ \right|<\frac{\beta}{2}$$
will construct a new open set that is contained in $\tilde{U}(P,\beta)$. It seems that a) is not always true. When $\mathcal X=\mathbb R$, consider $P= \frac{1}{2}I_{[0,1]} + \frac{1}{2}I_{\{3\}}$. For a measurable set $A=[2,3)$, no such $\bar{f_i}$ and $\underline{f_i}$ exist for each $\beta>0$.

2490876,Does in plane exist $22$ points and $22$ such circles that each circle contains at least $7$ points and each point is on at least $7$ circles.,"Does in plane exist $22$ points and $22$ such circles that each circle contains at least $7$ points and each point is on at least $7$ circles. I have solved this one but now I can't remember how I did it. I just remember that I used some linear algebra and double counting. Suppose each point $P_i\in \{P_1,P_2,...P_{22}\}$ is on $p_i\geq 7$ circles among circles $C_1,C_2,...,C_{22}$ . Since each pair $\{C_i,C_j\}$ share at most $2$ points and each point is on $\displaystyle{p_i\choose 2}$ pair of circles, we have: $$ 2\cdot {22\choose 2} \geq \sum _{i=1}^{22} {p_i\choose 2} \geq 22 {7\choose 2} $$ Since we must have all equalities we deduce that $p_i = 7$ for all $i$ and each pair of circles intersect in exactly two points. Now since $$ 22\cdot 7 \leq \sum _{i=1}^{22} |C_i| =  \sum _{i=1}^{22}p_i = 22\cdot 7$$ so each circle contains exactly $7$ points.","['matrices', 'combinatorics', 'contest-math', 'algebraic-combinatorics', 'linear-algebra']"

That is $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}: F_X(x) \geq F_Y(x).$ A third random variable $Z$ with $f_Z(t)$ is defined as $Z = \frac{X+Y}{2}$. 
My assumption is that $F_X(x)$ is always larger than or equal to $F_Z(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_Z(t)\,dt$, too. That is $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}: F_X(x) \geq F_Z(x).$ Is this a valid assumption and if yes, how to prove it?
Under which conditions does it hold if it is not a universally valid assumption?
The plots below depict the cumulative distribution functions as well as the probability density functions of exemplary X,Y and Z. Edit : I was able to show it for two given uniform distributions as follows. However, I assume it should also be possible to prove it for two arbitrary distributions. PDFs: $f_X(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2} & \text{for } 0 \leq t \leq 2,\\
0 & \text{otherwise}

$f_Y(t) = \begin{cases}

\end{cases}$, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}: F_X(x) \geq F_Y(x)$ obviously holds, because $F_X(x) = 1$ for all $x$ where $F_Y(x) > 0$. The addition of X and Y is described by the convolution of $f_X(t)$ and $f_Y(t)$ as $f_{X+Y}(t) = (f_X * f_Y)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(\tau)\cdot f_Y(t-\tau)\,d\tau = \begin{cases}

    2 - \frac{t}{4} & \text{for } 6 < t \leq 8\\

    4 - t & \text{for } 3 < t \leq 4\\

2491044,"Characterization of $C^{k,\alpha}$ (functions with Hölder continuous derivatives) through Taylor estimates","For $k \in \Bbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\dots\}$ and $\alpha \in (0,1)$, let us define
$$
C^{k,\alpha} := \{ f : \Bbb{R} \to \Bbb{R} \,:\, f \in C^k \text{ with } f, f', \dots, f^{(k)} \text{ bounded and } [f^{(k)}]_{C^\alpha} < \infty \},
$$
where
$$
[g]_{C^\alpha} := \sup_{x,y \in \Bbb{R}, x \neq y} \frac{|g(x)-g(y)|}{|x-y|^\alpha} \, .
$$ It is not hard to see by using Taylor's formula for $f \in C^{k,\alpha}$ that for each $x \in \Bbb{R}$, there is a polynomial $P_x$ of degree $k$ (namely, the Taylor polynomial of $f$) satisfying
$$
|f(x+h) - P_x (h)| \leq C \cdot |h|^{k+\alpha} \qquad \forall h \in \Bbb{R} \text{ with } |h| \leq 1, \tag{$\circledast$}
$$
with a constant $C$ independent of $x,h$ (but depending on $f$). It is claimed in Exercise 13.31 of certain notes by Martin Hairer that also the converse holds, i.e., if $f : \Bbb{R} \to \Bbb{R}$ and if there is a constant $C>0$, such that for each $x$, there is a polynomial $P_x$ of degree at most $k$ such that $(\circledast)$ holds, then $f \in C^{k,\alpha}$. I would like to know a solution to this exercise, and even the case $k=1$ would be interesting to me. To simplify the question a bit, let us assume that we already know $f$ to be $k$-times differentiable, with $f,f', \dots, f^{(k)}$ being bounded (I think this boundedness does not actually follow ""automatically""), so we only need to establish $\alpha$-Hölder continuity of $f^{(k)}$. After the fold, I discuss some of my ideas towards this problem. It might be better, however, to at first not read these ideas, since given that this is an exercise, they seem overly complicated (they refer to Campanato spaces, which are probably not known to everyone doing the exercise). Thus it might be better to start afresh instead of getting spoiled by my stupid thoughts :) My thoughts only apply to the case $k=1$. Here, one can more or less easily show that necessarily $P_x (h) = f(x) + f'(x) h$.
Then we get
\begin{align*}
& |f(x+h) - f(x-h) - 2h \cdot f'(x)| \\
& = |f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x) h - (f(x-h) - f(x) - f'(x) \cdot (-h))| \\
& \leq 2C |h|^{1+\alpha}
\end{align*}
for $|h| \leq 1$. But using the fundamental theorem of calculus to write $f(x+h) - f(x-h) = \int_{x-h}^{x+h} f'(s) ds$, and writing $g = f'$, we thus get
$$
\left|
- \int_{x-h}^{x+h} g(s) - g(x) ds
\right|
\leq 2C \cdot |h|^{1+\alpha}. \tag{$\dagger$}
$$
Now, it is known (see Lemma 0.0.15 in Some notes on Campanato spaces ) that the norm
$$
\| g \|_\ast = \|g\|_{L^1} + \sup_{x \in \Bbb{R}, 0 < h \leq C} \,\, \inf_{c \in \Bbb{R}} \,\, h^{-(1 + \alpha)} \int_{x-h}^{x+h} |g(t) - c| \, dt
$$
is an equivalent norm for the Campanato space $L^{1,1+\alpha}_C (\Bbb{R})$. Strictly speaking, I am cheating a bit here, since $\Bbb{R}$ is not a bounded domain. Thus, if in $(\dagger)$ above, we would have the absolute value inside the integral instead of outside, we would get a Campanato condition on the function $g = f'$. But it is known (see Wikipedia, or Theorem 0.0.22 of the notes I linked above) that $L^{1, 1+\alpha}_C = C^{0,\alpha}$ is the space of $\alpha$-Hölder continuous functions. Thus, my hope is (I am currently investigating this) that one can adapt the arguments from the lecture notes above to also work in the case where the absolute value is outside of the integral. As I said above, I don't think that this is the right solution, since it seems overly complicated :) I would be happy about any thoughts!","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'stochastic-pde', 'holder-spaces']"
2491045,How many primes do I need to check to confirm that an integer $L$ is prime?,"I recently saw the 1998 horror movie ""Cube"", in which a character claims it is humanly impossible to determine, by hand without a computer, if large (in the movie 3-digit) integers are prime powers, i.e. they are divisible by exactly one prime number. Naturally I decided to try working this problem by hand on paper. Firstly, In order to determine if a number is a prime power, I only needed to find one prime factor. For example, $5$ is a prime factor of $555$ (because $555 = 5*111$), but the other factor ($111$), is not divisible by five, so therefore $555$ has more prime factors than just $5$, and $555$ is not a prime power. I was initially just checking all the prime numbers less than the integer $L$, in order, to see if they were factors of $L$. For 3-digit numbers this usually doesn't take that long, but if $L$ itself is a prime, then you'll end up checking every prime less than $L$. So, the question becomes: Given an arbitrary integer $L$, if you perform a brute force search, checking every prime number from a list, what is the minimum number of primes you would need to check before you could stop and conclude that $L$ is prime? I decided to try to narrow down the search space. If I have a prime number $P$, where $\frac{L}{2}<P<L$, then that prime number could not possibly be a factor of $L$, because $2P>\frac{2L}{2}$, or, $2P > L$. Similarly if $\frac{L}{3}<P<L$, then, once again, $P$ could not possibly be a factor of $L$, because $3P > L$, and I've already checked that $2$ is not a factor of $L$, so $2P ≠ L$. You could make this same argument for $\frac{L}{5}, \frac{L}{7}, \frac{L}{11}$, etc. In other words, I don't need to check every prime number, I just need to check every prime number up to the point where $\frac{L}{P_{n}} < P_{n}$, ($P_{n}$ is the nth prime number) because, at that point, all primes before $P_{n}$ have been ruled out, and since $P_{n} > \frac{L}{P_{n}}$ then $(P_{n})^2 > L$, thus $P_{n}$ is not a factor of $L$. Also, if $P_{n} > \frac{L}{P_{n}}$ then $P_{n + 1} > \frac{L}{P_{n + 1}}$, because $P_{n + 1} > P_{n}$, this same reasoning rules out all larger primes. So, for example, when trying to find a prime factor of $607$, rather than checking every prime number less than $607$, I only need to check the first $10$ primes up to $29$, because $\frac{607}{29} < 29$. If the first $10$ primes are not factors of $607$, then $607$ has no prime factors and must be prime. Is my reasoning valid, and, is it possible to reduce the number of primes you'd need to check even more?","['number-theory', 'popular-math', 'prime-factorization', 'prime-numbers']"

  $\sum_{i=1}^k h_i=0$ and $|h_i| \leq \max\{g_i , 1 − g_i\}$. Since

$$ Let us denote the set of such right hand side vectors $b$ by $U(A)=\{b∈\mathbb{R}^m : P_b \neq ∅\}.$ Switching from the H-representation to its V- representation, the cone U (A) is generated by 9 rays and 3 lines in $Z^{10}$ .
The normal cone of a face F of a polytope P in $R^d$ is the set $N(F;P)=\{v∈\mathbb{R}^dd : v^⊤x=h(P,v)~for~all~ x∈F\}.$ The dimension of the normal cone of a $k$ -dimensional face is $(d − k)$ . The normal fan $N(P)$ of $P$ , which is the collection of the normal cones of all faces of $P$ , is a complete fan in $\mathbb{R}^d$ . I have difficulty in understanding of the terms.
So, what is the exact meaning of $U(A)$ here? What are the $b_{1,2,...}$ letters and how obtained? How is the 9 rays and 3 lines expression written? Can you explain also meanings of normal fan,cone and complete fan? Article can be found from here. I want to grasp all of the article also I have to, but at least up to there is enough. @Edit: I think it's a kinda Millenium Problem .

2491398,The $\sigma$ - algebra generated by the nowhere dense subsets of a topological space,"I need to determine the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the nowhere dense subsets of a topological space. Here is my attempt: I define the set of nowhere dense subsets as $\{A: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \}$, $A \in X$, where $X$ is the topological space. Let $S$ be the $\sigma$-algebra. By the fact that $\sigma$-algebras are algebras, $\emptyset, X \in S$ Also, all nowhere dense subsets are in $S$, so $\{A: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \in S$. $S$ is closed under compliments, so $\{A^c: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \in S$ But we have unions and intersections, and the finite unions of nowhere dense sets are still nowhere dense: $\{B \bigcup C: (\overline B)^o= \emptyset$ and $(\overline C)^o= \emptyset\} \subseteq \{A: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \in S$. Finite intersections of nowhere dense sets are either nowhere dense or empty: $\{B \bigcap C: (\overline B)^o= \emptyset$ and $(\overline C)^o= \emptyset\} = \emptyset \in S$ if $B \bigcap C = \emptyset$, or $\{B \bigcap C: (\overline B)^o= \emptyset$ and $(\overline C)^o= \emptyset\} \subseteq \{A: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \in S$ if $B \bigcap C \neq \emptyset$. Then we have finite intersections and unions of complements, which are easily sorted by the identities $(X\setminus A) \bigcup (X\setminus B) = X\setminus (A \bigcap B)$ and  $(X\setminus A) \bigcap (X\setminus B) = X\setminus (A \bigcup B)$. The finite unions of nowhere dense sets and complements of nowhere dense sets are not nowhere dense, neither are they compliments of nowhere dense sets. So they are of a third type, and can be written $\{A \bigcup B^c: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset$ and $(\overline B)^o= \emptyset \} \in S$. The finite intersections of nowhere dense sets and the compliments of nowhere dense sets should either be nowhere dense or empty, so they are of the first type or empty depending on if there is overlap. Therefore, the $\sigma$-algebra $S = \{\emptyset, X\} \bigcup \{A: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \bigcup \{A^c: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset \} \bigcup \{A \bigcup B^c: (\overline A)^o= \emptyset$ and $(\overline B)^o= \emptyset \}$.

2491445,Are the trigonometric functions really Elementary Functions?,"The wikipedia page for Elementary Function defines it as follows. In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations (+ – × ÷), exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots). It goes on to say the following about trigonometric functions. The elementary functions include the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses, as they are expressible with complex exponentials and logarithms. However, the trigonometric function definitions I have seen do not appear to satisfy the 'Elementary Function' requirements . Here are two definitions I've seen alongside my objections on why the definition does not appear to be Elementary. The relevant section of the Trigonometric Functions wikipedia page includes the following definitions of $\sin$ and $\cos$. $$\cos x = \operatorname{Re}(e^{i x})$$
$$\sin x = \operatorname{Im}(e^{i x})$$ My objection: the definition uses the $\operatorname{Re}$ and $\operatorname{Im}$ operators, which do not appear to be Elementary Functions themselves according to the definition. Also, the Wolfram Research Functions site lists the following sum as a definition for $\sin$. $$\sin z = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k z^{2 k + 1}}{(2 k + 1)!}$$ My objection: an infinite number of operations are used, which is in violation of the definition. Is the wikipedia article correct in asserting that the trigonometric functions are indeed Elementary? If so, how can one construct the trigonometric functions using a finite number of compositions of elementary operations? A side note: In addition to the objections listed above, it seems strange that $e$ -- being transcendental and therefore not constructible using finite compositions of the elementary operations -- could be used as a constant in the construction of other elementary operations. I would be interested in hearing perspective on whether or why transcendental constants are permitted in the construction of Elementary Functions.","['elementary-functions', 'trigonometry']"
2491449,Fourier Series of $f(x) = \sin x$ on $-\pi \leq x \leq \pi$,"Find the Fourier series of, $$f(x) = \sin (x)$$ on the interval $- \pi \leq x \leq \pi. $ I am not quite sure if my workings are correct or if I have chose the right formulas to use since this is my first encounter of Fourier series of trigonometric functions. My logic here is that $f(x)$ is a period function so I have to use the formula, $$f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum _ {n=1}^{\infty}\Big(A_n\cos(nx) + B_n\sin (nx)\Big)$$ where, $$A_0 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi} f(x)dx$$
$$A_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi} f(x)\cos (nx)dx$$
$$B_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int^{\pi}_{-\pi} f(x)\sin (nx)dx$$ Looking at the function $f(x) = \sin x$ this is a odd function so $A_0$ is a odd function, so $A_0=0$. Next looking at $A_n$, $f(x)$ is a odd function at $\cos(nx)$ is a even function, so a even function multiplied by a odd function is a odd function and therefore $A_n = 0 $ Finally considering $B_n$, $$B_n = \frac{1}{\pi } \int^{\pi}_{-\pi} \sin (x) \sin(nx) = \frac{cos(x)sin(nx)-nsin(x)cos(nx)}{n^2-1}\Bigg|_{-\pi}^{\pi} = - \frac{2sin(\pi n )}{n^2-1}$$ Therefore, the Fourier series of $f(x) = \sin x $ on $-\pi \leq x \leq \pi$ is, $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} - \frac{2sin(\pi n )}{n^2-1}\sin(nx) = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty} \sin x$$","['fourier-series', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
