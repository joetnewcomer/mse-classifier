407822,Differentiating both sides of an equation,"I'm going through the MIT lecture on implicit differentiation, and the first two steps are shown below, taking the derivative of both sides: $$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$
$$\frac{d}{dx} x^2 + \frac{d}{dx} y^2 = \frac{d}{dx} 1$$
$$2x + \frac{d}{dx}y^2 = 0$$ That makes some sense, but what about this example: $$x = 5$$
$$\frac{d}{dx} x = \frac{d}{dx} 5$$
$$1 = 0$$ Why is the first example correct, while the second is obviously wrong?","['implicit-differentiation', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

We also discussed using the formula $A^{-1}=\frac{\operatorname{adj}(A)}{\det(A)}$, however after a few examples, it was clear that this formula would take far too long to find the inverse of A as the matrix size got bigger.

407962,Trying to prove a theorem about convergence of a sequence.,"The following is the problem that I am working on. Prove that if $\{s_n\}$ converges, then $\{|s_n|\}$ converges. The following is the idea of the proof I'm trying to make, so it's a little loose. However, I'm not 100% sure if I'm doing it right. proof: If $\{s_n\}$ converges, then $\{s_n\}$ must be bounded and Cauchy, i.e, $\delta(s_n,s_m) < \epsilon$ for a large enough $n,m$. Consider $\delta(|s_n|,s_m) $. If $s_n > 0$ then $\delta(|s_n|,s_m) =\delta(s_n,s_m) < \epsilon$ so we are done. And I'm stuck here. I cannot make a good argument when $s_n<o$. I can see that $\{|s_n|\}$ is bounded above by either $\sup (s_n)$ or $|\inf (s_n)|$, but I remember that boundedness doesn't guarantee convergence. $\{s_n\}$ is not necessarily monotonic either, so I was wondering what I could do.

407968,"Second derivative Dirac delta distribution times $(x-a)^2$, intepretation","I'm not sure if this calculation is correct and if I interpret it correctly (from old exam). Show that $ (x-a)^2 \delta ''_a = 2 \delta _a $. We have for distributions $f$ and test functions $\varphi$ that $\langle\delta_a,\varphi\rangle = \varphi(a)$ and $\langle f', \varphi\rangle = -\langle f, \varphi'\rangle$. My calculations are as follows: Let $y = x-a$ and note that $y'=1$, then it follows that $$\begin{align} \langle y^2\delta_a'',\varphi\rangle & = \langle \delta_a'',y^2\varphi\rangle \\ & =-\langle\delta_a',(y^2\varphi)'\rangle \\ & = -\langle\delta_a',2 y\varphi+y^2\varphi' \rangle
\\ & =\langle\delta_a,(2 y\varphi+y^2\varphi')'\rangle \\ & = \langle\delta_a,2\varphi+2y\varphi' +2y\varphi'+y^2\varphi''\rangle \\ & =2\varphi(a) \\ & =2\langle\delta_a,\varphi\rangle \end{align}$$ Any comments on the calculations? So I guess that this shows that given the function $y=x-a$, a new distribution can be formed by $y^2 \delta_a''$ which maps test functions $\varphi$ to $2\varphi(a)$, and the distribution $y^2 \delta_a''$ is equal to $2\delta_a$ since they map test functions to the same value.","['distribution-theory', 'weak-derivatives', 'analysis']"
407969,Question about proof that finite-dimensional subspaces of normed vector spaces are direct summands,"I am reading a proof that finite-dimensional subspaces of normed vector spaces have closed direct sum complements. This is the proof: Let $\{e_1, ..., e_n\}$ be a basis for $\mathcal M$. Every $x \in 
 \mathcal M$ has then a unique representation $$x = \alpha_1(x)e_1 +...+
 \alpha_n(x)e_n.$$ Each $\alpha_i$ is a continuous linear functional on
   $\mathcal M$ (a linear map from  finite dimensional space is always
   continuous) which extends to a member of $\mathcal X^*$,  by the
   Hahn-Banach theorem ($\mathcal X^*$ is the dual of $\mathcal X$). Let
   $\mathcal N$ be the intersection of the null spaces of these extenÂ­sions. Then $\mathcal X = \mathcal M\oplus \mathcal N$. I follow it until the last sentence. Clearly $\mathcal N$ is closed, as it is the intersection of closed sets (the inverse of $0$ under any continuous function, and in particular any linear functional on a vector space, is closed). Also it is easy to see that $\mathcal M \cap \mathcal N= \{0\}$, since if some $m\in\mathcal M$ is in every null space, it must have the zero coefficient for every basis vector, and so it must be zero. My question: Why do we have $\mathcal X =\mathcal M + \mathcal N$? This seems to only hold if the extension given by Hahn-Banach is zero off of $\mathcal M$, but I see no reason why this should be the case.","['topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

407987,The 4-sphere does not admit dimension 2 foliations,"I want to know if the 4-sphere admits dimension 2 foliations. I found the following theorem in a dissertation by Jonathan Bowden (this is googleable, but I won't link it because I don't know exactly what the copyright issues might be). Anyway, here it is: A closed, oriented 4-manifold admits an oriented 2-plane distribution if and only if  there exists a pair  $K_+,K_-\in H^2(M)$ such that $$\langle K_\pm^2,[M]\rangle = \pm 2\chi(M)+3\sigma(M)$$
$$K_\pm\equiv w_2(M)\mod 2$$ Since a requirement for a $n$-dimensional foliation is a 2-plane distribution, and a sphere has trivial middle homology, I think this implies the 4-sphere has no dimension 2 foliations. Am I correct? EDIT: For any complex manifold $M$ we have the canonical line bundle $K_M=det_{\mathbb{C}}T^*_M$, and $$K_M\cdot K_M=3\sigma (M)+2\chi(M)$$ So I'm not sure about the equivalence of these notations; I think that pairing over $[M]$ might be implied in the second one since if you represent these classes as forms you need to integrate over the manifold to get integers. But then again the 4-sphere is not a complex manifold, but maybe there is some connection between complex 2-manifolds and when they can be foliated in dimension 2?

408002,Newbie: determine if line *segment* intersects circle,"I've read related posts, including: How to tell if a line segment intersects with a circle? where the suggestions are probably relevant, but above my level, and the final solution  is actually not what I need, and Circle and Line segment intersection Which may be what I need, but assumes more math knowledge than is in my brain. Context: I have two circles in powerpoint, each of which have 8 points (anchors) on the perimeter. I am cycling through all 64 combinations in VBA to identify which two lines provide the longest point-to-point connectors that do not go through either circle. For convenience, I can check each line against each circle separately. Basically, I am trying to create code that will allow me to automatically create something like this http://www.harrisgolfonline.com/userfiles/image/wlcc%201932%20bylaws%20callout.jpg except I'll also have a small circle around the enlarged part of the original image. I'm trying to get the math to figure out which circle anchors will give me those two outer lines. So for example, if I draw the shortest possible line segment between the two closest connectors, I should not intersect with either circle. A line between the furthest away connectors would have to travel through both circles, and therefore fail either circle test. Anyway, I'm hoping someone can help me with the equation setup, since the two pages I reference put in multiple equations and then say ""then just solve it"". I'm not exactly sure how to combine those formulas to solve. What I'm hoping for is something more like this equation, except this evaluates based on the whole line and not just a line segment: Private Function LineCrossesCircle(x1, y1, x2, y2, cx, cy, cr) As Boolean x1 = x1 - cx

y1 = y1 - cy

x2 = x2 - cx

y2 = y2 - cy

LineCrossesCircle = 0 <= cr ^ 2 * ((x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2) - (x1 * y2 - x2 * y1) ^ 2 End Function Reading the answers, I do understand that there may be multiple conditions, e.g. it may be something similar to the above AND some other equation or two. My connector points will always be on the circumference of the circle, so I was adjusting my calculated radius value to be [r*.95] otherwise they might all intersect at the endpoints. That means that my endpoints will never fall within the circles, but part of the line will fall in one or both circles probably 80% of the time. Once I find the lines that don't, I can check their lengths and add them as connectors. Any help translating the previous solutions into one or more equations that just take the two endpoints (x1, y1, x2, y2) and circle info (cx, cy, cr) and return a boolean for whether there is an intersect would be greatly appreciated!! =================================================================================== Sample code based on OAO's helpful post.

408004,Does a non-trivial solution exist for $f'(x)=f(f(x))$?,"Does $f'(x)=f(f(x))$ have any solutions other than $f(x)=0$? I have become convinced that it does (see below), but I don't know of any way to prove this. Is there a nice method for solving this kind of equation? If this equation doesn't have any non-trivial solutions, do you know of any similar equations (i.e. involving both nested functions and derivatives) that do have interesting solutions? If we assume $f$ is analytic (which I will be doing from this point onward), then it must also be injective (see alex.jordan's attempted proof), and therefore has at most one root (call it $x_0$.) We know $f'(x_0)=f(f(x_0))=f(0)$. Claim: $f$ cannot have a positive root. Suppose $x_0$ is positive. If $f(0)$ is negative, then for some sufficiently small $\delta>0$, $f(x_0-\delta)>0$. This implies there must be another root between $x_0$ and $0$, but $f$ has at most one root. The same reasoning applies if $f(0)$ is positive. If $f(0)=0$, then both $x_0$ and $0$ are roots. Thus, we conclude that $x_0$ cannot be positive. Claim: $f$ cannot have zero as a root. Suppose $x_0=0$. Since $f$ has at most one root, we know $f$ will be of constant sign on each of the positive and negative halves of the $x$ axis. Let $a<0$. If $f(a)<0$, this implies $f'(a)=f(f(a))<0$, so on the negative half of the real line, $f$ is negative and strictly decreasing. This contradicts the assumption that $f(0)=0$. Therefore, $a<0\implies f(a)>0$, which then implies $f'(a)<0$. But since $f'(a)=f(f(a))$, and $f(a)>0$, this implies $f(b)<0$ when $b>0$. Moreover, we know $f'(b)=f(f(b))$, and $f(b)<0 \implies f(f(b))>0$, so we know $f$ is negative and strictly increasing on the positive half of the real line. This contradicts the assumption that $f(0)=0$. Claim: $f$ is bounded below by $x_0$ (which we've proved must be negative if it exists) We know $f(x_0)=0$ is the only root, so $f'(x)=0$ iff $f(x)=x_0$. And since $f$ is injective, it follows that $f$ is either bounded above or bounded below by $x_0$ (if $f$ crossed $y=x_0$, that would correspond to a local minimum or maximum.) Since $f(x_0)=0$ and $x_0<0$, we know $x_0$ must be a lower bound. Claim: $f$ is strictly decreasing. Question B5 from the 2010 Putnam math competition rules out strictly increasing functions, so we know $f$ must be strictly decreasing. Claim: $f$ has linear asymptotes at $\pm \infty$ Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and bounded below by $x_0$, we know $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)$ is well defined, and $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f'(x)=0$. Since $f'(x)=0$ iff $f(x)=x_0$, it follows that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)=x_0$. $f''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f(f(x))=f'(f(x))f'(x)$. Since $f'(x)<0$, we know $f$ is concave up. Thus, $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)\rightarrow\infty$. This in turn implies $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f'(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(f(x))=\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}f(x)=x_0$. So $f$ goes to $x_0$ when $x\rightarrow\infty$, and approaches the asymptote $y=x_0\cdot x$ when $x\rightarrow-\infty$. Claim: $x_0<1$ Consider the tangent line at $f(x_0)$. We know $f'(x_0)=f(0)$, so this line is given by $y=f(0)x-f(0)x_0$. Since $f$ is concave up, we know $f(x) > f(0)x-f(0)x_0$ for $x\neq x_0$, so $f(0) > -f(0)x_0$. And we can conclude $x_0<-1$. Claim: $f$ must have a fixed point, $x_p$ (i.e. $f(x_p)=x_p$) We know $f(x_0)=0$, $x_0<0$, and $f(0)<0$. Therefore, $f(x)-x$ has a root in the interval $(x_0,0)$. This is all I have been able to prove. However, the existence of a fixed point turns out to be very useful in constructing approximate solutions. Consider the following: $$f(x_p)=x_p$$
$$f'(x_p)=f(f(x_p))=x_p$$
$$f''(x_p)=f'(f(x_p))f'(x_p)=f(f(f(x_p)))f(f(x_p))=x_p^2$$
$$f'''(x_p)=\cdots=x_p^4+x_p^3$$ If we are willing to put in the work, we can evaluate any derivative at the fixed point. I wrote a python program that computes these terms (unfortunately it runs in exponential time, but it's still fast enough to compute the first 20 or so terms in a reasonable amount of time). It leverages the following bit of information. Suppose $f^{[n]}$ represents the nth iterate of $f$. e.g. $f^{[3]}=f(f(f(x)))$. Then we can derive the following recursive formula. $$\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n]}=f'(f^{[n-1]})\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n-1]}=f^{[n+1]}\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n-1]}$$ And since we know the base case $\frac{d}{dx}f^{[1]}=f^{[2]}$, this lets us determine $(f^{[n]})'=f^{[n+1]}f^{[n]}\cdots f^{[3]}f^{[2]}$. So, if we choose a fixed point, we can calculate the expected Taylor series around that point. Here's the graph for the Taylor series with 14 terms, calculated with fixed point $-0.6$ You can clearly see the points where the series starts to fail (the radius of convergence doesn't seem to be infinite), but elsewhere the approximation behaves just as we would expect. I computed $(P'(x)-P(P(x)))^2$, where $P$ is the Taylor polynomial, over the range where the series seems to converge, and the total error is on the order of $10^{-10}$. Moreover, this error seems to get smaller the more accurately you compute the derivative (I used $P'(x)\approx\frac{P(x+0.001)-P(x-0.001)}{0.002}$).","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'functional-equations']"

This is my progress: I am starting with differential equations so I will write $dx/dt$ instead of just $x'$ in order to not get confused between differentiating against $t$ or $u$ (sorry if the english grammar is not correct). Thus, I'll rewrite my equation as $(1-t^2)^2 \dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} - t \dfrac{dx}{dt} + a^2x = 0$ Then I apply then change of variable $t = \phi(u)$. Let's put $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ and $ \dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} $ in terms of  $\dfrac{dx}{du}$ by using the chain rule (I will omit the argument of $\phi$ (which is always $u$ so that the equations don't get messy): $\dfrac{dx}{du}$ = $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ $\dfrac{dt}{du}$ = $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ $\phi' \Longrightarrow \dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{du} \dfrac{1}{\phi'}$ $\dfrac{d^2x}{du^2} =  \dfrac{d}{du}\left( \dfrac{dx}{du}\right) =  \dfrac{d}{du}\left( \dfrac{dx}{dt}  \dfrac{dt}{du}\right) =  \dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} \dfrac{dx}{du} \dfrac{dx}{du} + \dfrac{dx}{dt} \dfrac{d^2t}{du^2} =  \dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} \phi'^2 + \dfrac{dx}{dt} \phi'' $ From the last line we can obtain $d^2x/dt^2$: $\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \dfrac{1}{\phi'^2}(\dfrac{d^2x}{du^2} - \phi'' \dfrac{dx}{dt})
= \dfrac{1}{\phi'^2}\left(\dfrac{d^2x}{du^2} - \dfrac{\phi''}{\phi'} \dfrac{dx}{du}\right)$ Now we can rewrite the original equation as: $(1-\phi(u)^2)^2\left(\frac{1}{\phi'^2}\left(\dfrac{d^2x}{du^2} - \dfrac{\phi''}{\phi'} \dfrac{dx}{du}\right)\right) - \phi(u) \left(\dfrac{dx}{du} \dfrac{1}{\phi'}\right) + a^2 x = 0$ Sorting and using $x'$ and $x''$ again: $\dfrac{(1-\phi(u)^2)^2}{(\phi(u)')^2} x'' +\left(\dfrac{(1-\phi(u)^2)^2 \phi''(u)}{(\phi'(u))^3} + \dfrac{\phi(u)}{\phi'(u)}\right) x'+ a^2 x = 0$ Now following the hint: $\dfrac{(1-\phi(u)^2)^2 \phi''(u)}{(\phi'(u))^3} + \dfrac{\phi(u)}{\phi'(u)} = 0

Find norm $\| A\|.$ First, I have to show that if $x = (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \ell^p$ then $\displaystyle y=(y_m)_{m=1}^{\infty} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m}\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right)_{m=1}^{\infty} \in \ell^p$, that is $\displaystyle\sqrt[p]{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}|y_m|^p} < +\infty.$ All right, $$\begin{align*} |y_m|=\left|\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m}\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right|&\leq\frac{1}{m} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \frac{|x_n|}{\sqrt{n}}\\ &\stackrel{\star}{\leq}\frac{1}{m} \sqrt[p]{\sum_{n=1}^{m}|x_n|^p} \sqrt[q]{\sum_{n=1}^{m} n^{-q/2}} \\
&\leq \frac{\| x \|_p}{m}\sqrt[q]{\sum_{n=1}^{m} n^{-q/2}}.\end{align*}$$ So $$\begin{align*} \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} |y_m|^p &\leq \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left|\frac{\| x \|_p}{m}\sqrt[q]{\sum_{n=1}^{m} n^{-q/2}}\right|^p\\&=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{m^p} \| x\|^p_p \left(\sum_{n=1}^{m} n^{-q/2}\right)^{p/q}\\ &\leq \|x\|^p_p \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{m^p}   \left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-q/2}\right)^{p/q} \end{align*}$$ If I see well, last sum is convergent for $q/2 >1 \iff q>2$ and $p>1$ (but with condition $1/p + 1/q =1$). I think my estimate is too sharp. And we find that $$\| A \| \leq \sqrt[p]{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{m^p}   \left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-q/2}\right)^{p/q}}$$ But for part (if my approximation is good enough) with $\geq$ I don't have idea (to be honest, I used HÃ¶lder inequality, so we want $x_n = c  \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, that will give us something divergent I think so). $\star$ - one doubt also: I used here HÃ¶lder inequality, but that works only for $p,q >1$, but in my question we have $p \geq 1$, so basically I have to work case $p=1$ as separate?","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

where $S$ is a right circular cone of altitude $h$ with its base, of radius $a$, in the $xy$-plane and its axis along the $z$-axis, in cylindrical coordinates. Switching to cylindrical coordinates, we clearly have $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ and $0 \leq z \leq h$. I imagine a cross section of the cone as a right triangle with $\rho$ from the origin to the hypotenuse and a horizontal line at $z$ intersecting $\rho$ at the hypotenuse. Then $\rho=\sqrt{z^2+x^2}$, where $x$ is the length of the horizontal line. The horizontal line forms another triangle similar to the first, and so its length should be
$$\frac{x}{h-z}=\frac{a}{h}$$
$$x=\frac{a(h-z)}{h}$$
so I have the inequality
$$0 \leq \rho \leq \sqrt{\left(\frac{a(h-z)}{h}\right)^2+z^2}$$

I assume I've done something wrong finding the bounds for $\rho$, but I can't figure out what it is so I was hoping someone could tell me what I'm doing wrong.

The strategy was to evaluate the limit of the integral on the boundary of a half-disk of radius $R$ and then subtract the limit of the integral on the half-circle. What I am confused with, is that when computing the integral on the boundary of the half-disk, I used the residue theorem to compute the integral thinking that $\cos(x)$ is meromorphic everywhere but infinity, and our domain is a finite (open) disk, and then took the limit.  However, the reference I am using, says that $\cos(x)$ has an essential singularity at infinity and thus uses a different strategy (computing the limit for $\frac{\exp(ix)}{x^2+a^2}$ and then taking the real part). I don't understand why I cannot use the residue theorem, and then take the limit in this case, because our domain (although gets unbounded when taking a limit) is a finite disk on which cosine is meromorphic.

Towards introducing the graded Betti numbers, let $F_i = \bigoplus_{d} (F_i)_d$ , where $(F_i)_d$ is the homogeneous component of degree $d$ . Now, $(F_i)_d$ is a finite-dimensional $k$ -vector space. Here is the part that confuses me: at slide 20, the author says ""we give to each generator of $F_i$ a degree"" and subsequently writes $F_i = \bigoplus_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} S(-j)^{\beta_{i,j}}$ , and he mentions that $S(-j)$ is cyclic free module. Question 1. I can not understand what it means to give a degree to each generator (i don't see why every generator has to be inside some homogenous component, in which case we could associate a degree to each generator). Question 2. What exactly is $S(-j)$ ? Initially, i thought that $S(-j)$ was the homogeneous component of $S$ of degree $-j$ , however, this is not a cyclic module as the author claims at slide 27.

408309,Degrees of faithful irreducible representations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ over finite fields,I came across the following theorem while studying representation theory over finite fields. A cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ has a faithful irreducible representation of degree $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if $n \mid p^d-1$ but $n \not\mid p^i-1$ for all $i<d$ I can show that under these conditions a faithful irreducible representation of degree $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exists by sending a generator of the cyclic group to the companion matrix of a polynomial of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. My question is a) How can I show that all faithful irreducible representations of degree $d$ can be found in this way. b) How can I show that there are no faithful irreducible representation of other degrees.

408338,Identically distributed and correlated systems of random variables,"I have a rectangular grid of $n \times m$ lightbulbs on a torus, each situated at a grid point. That is, the lightbulbs' coordinates range from $(0,0)$ to $(n-1,m-1)$ and the lightbulb $(0,0)$ has neighbors $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,m-1)$, and $(n-1,0)$. For each edge, I flip a coin that gives heads with probability $p$. Any lightbulb that has 1 or 3 of its edges heads is on; otherwise it is off. Let $X_{i,j}$ be a random variable that is 1 if the lightbulb at $(i,j)$ is on, and 0 otherwise. Clearly the $X_{i,j}$ are identically distributed. However, they are not independent. I would like to describe the distribution of the system of $X_{i,j}$ (whatever that means; the individual $X_{i,j}$ are tame enough). Assume that $n=m$ if that helps. Formally, what I am asking is: if $X$ is the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is $X_{i,j}$, how is $X$ distributed? It is not the same as flipping a coin for each entry. I am rusty enough in my probability theory that I don't really know where to begin. I notice that this has a similarity to the square lattice Ising model, but I believe it is only a resemblance -- there is no value of $p$, for instance, that leads to nearly all of the lightbulbs being on.

408507,The distinguished open sets are affine subschemes,"If $Y=$ Spec$A$ is an affine scheme and $D(f)\subseteq Y$ (with $f\in A$) is a distinguished open, I want to show that $(D(f),\mathscr O_{Y|D(f)})$ is an affine scheme. Below  there is my attempt of proof, but I've found a little problem, please help me to fix it. Preliminary notations If $(X,\mathscr O_X)$ and $(Y,\mathscr O_Y)$ are two schemes then a morphism between them is simply a morphism of locally ringed spaces $(\varphi, \varphi^{\flat})$. $\varphi: X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map and $\varphi^{\flat}: \mathscr O_Y\rightarrow{\varphi_{\ast}\mathscr O}_X $ is a morphism of sheaves (of rings) on $X$ such that the corresponding map (by adjunction) $\varphi^{\#}:{\varphi^{-1}\mathscr O}_Y\rightarrow \mathscr O_X$ has the property that the induced map on stalks $\varphi_x^{\#}:\mathscr O_{Y,\varphi(x)}\rightarrow \mathscr O_{X,x}$ is a local homomorphism of local rings for every $x\in X$. Practically to give a morphism of schemes I can exhibit a couple $(\varphi, \varphi^{\flat})$ or, in alternative, a couple $(\varphi, \varphi^{\#})$ (with the above notations) but in both cases the map  $\varphi_x^{\#}$ should be a local homomorphism. Data: $A$ is a ring, $Y=$ Spec$A$ and $X=$ Spec$A_f$ with $f\in A$. Clearly $\mathscr O_Y$ and $\mathscr O_X$ are the relative structure sheaves. Claim: $(D(f),\mathscr O_{Y|D(f)})\cong (X,\mathscr O_X)$ My proof: By an important fact from commutative algebra we know that $X$ is homeomorphic to $D(f)$ by $\varphi$; this homeomorphism $\varphi$ is induced by the canonical map $A\rightarrow A_f$. Now I will show  a map $\psi_x:\mathscr O_{Y,\varphi(x)}\rightarrow \mathscr O_{X,x}$ that is an isomorphism of local rings for any $x\in X$. Then we have finished because we can say that exits a map $\varphi^{\#}$ such that $\varphi^{\#}_x=\psi_x$ for any $x\in X$. Since $\mathscr O_{Y,\varphi(x)}=A_{\varphi(x)}$ (remember $x$ is a prime ideal) and $\mathscr O_{X,x}=(A_f)_x$, the isomorphism $\psi_x$ is the obviuous one. The problem: Is it enough to give the maps $\varphi^{\#}_x=\psi_x$ at level of the stalks? Who does ensure that once  $\psi_x$ is given for every $x$, does exist $\varphi^{\#}$ such that $\varphi^{\#}_x=\psi_x$? Edit : For a  simpler proof, maybe, I should use the following fact I can take the identity of $A_f$ (it represent the global section of $X$ and $Y$) and then show that the corresponding map between $X$ and $Y$ is an isomorphism of schemes.","['affine-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry']"

It could also be represented in roman symbols $II$ for example. For the decimal base, there is a logic of succession , which is: $$0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$$ And then when we reach nine, we rotate the number in the left (which was $0$ previously): $$\color{red}{\square} 8, \color{red}{\square} 9, \color{red}{1}0,...$$ The algorithm for roman symbols is fairly different: $$I,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX,X,...$$ It's possible to express $I$, $II$, $III$ and $V$, the four is formed with a rule of subtracting $1$ from the number in the right $\color{blue}{I}\color{red}{V}=\color{red}{5}-\color{blue}{1}=4$, It's the same for nine: $\color{blue}{I}\color{red}{X}=\color{red}{10}-\color{blue}{1}=9$. Is there a field of study for these representations? Has anyone proposed axioms for their inner working or we've always used them intuitively?

Now he divided $x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1$ by $x^2 - 4x + 5$. The quotient was $x + 1$ and the remainder $x - 6$. Now since $\rm dividend = quotient\cdot divisor + remainder$, he concluded that $x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = x-6$ since the divisor is $0$. Plugging $2 + i$ into $x - 6$, we get $-4 + i$.

And I got $$\lim_{n \to \infty} |\frac{1+z^n}{1+z^{n+1}}| = \lim_{n \to \infty} |{1 \over z}| $$ and it will converge when $$|{1 \over z}| \lt 1.$$ Putting $z = a + bi$ , I found that $$\sqrt{1 \over {a^2+b^2}} \lt 1$$ is the necessary condition for the series to converge. Despite not knowing what it means, I got something. Am I on the right track ? Or am I dating myself here?","['complex-numbers', 'analysis']"

408860,Water Systems â when can I use buckets of water to simulate an ODE?,"It is quite common to use physical systems to perform calculations (see here and here ). This is for a number of reasons: sometimes the physical system is efficient, sometimes it helps us understand the general principles of the physical system, and sometimes, because it can be a good way of demonstrating how a formal system works. In this case, I am interested in the latter case. I want to find a physical system that demonstrates how a system of ODEs works. Specifically, I'm interested in ODEs of a particular form: $$\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial t} = \sum_j A_{ij} x_j + B_i$$ I have a specific case in mind, but the general case is interesting. In particular I have been thinking about water models, which can model a subset of these equations, and about which I have some questions (see below). The following is an instantiation of the system: $$ \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = A - Bx$$
$$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = Bx - Cy$$ with appropriately chosen $A\propto a$, $B \propto b$ etc. Here is another system, choosing the appropriate $k \propto K$ (one can easily add a constant into this by changing the relative heights): $$\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = k(y-x)$$
$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = k(x-y)$$ My questions : Show whether the system $$ \dot{x} = a - bx + cy$$ $$\dot{y} = bx - dy$$ can be instantiated using pumps, taps, and holes (I'm fairly sure it cannot). More generally, using pumps, taps and holes, what are the constraints on $[A_{ij}]$ and $[B_i]$. Assuming that the equation in (1) cannot be instantiated, what physical modification could be used to make it possible. (there are quite a lot of possibilities, for example, this ) So far : For 2: The way I'm thinking of going about it is to define a ""water system"" inductively. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of ""water systems"", made of a set of differential equations and a logical condition $\mathcal{C}$ under which they apply. This may or may not be correct... The pair containing $n$ diffential equations $\{\dot{x_i} = 0 \;|\; i=1\ldots n\}$ and $\mathcal{C}=T$ is a water system. Joining basins: If $\{\dot{x}_i = f_i(x_1 \ldots x_n)\}\in\mathcal{W}$, then systems transformed by $$f_i\rightarrow f_i + k(x_i - x_j + \Delta h)$$ $$f_j \rightarrow f_j + k(x_j - x_i - \Delta h)$$ $$C \rightarrow C \wedge (something??) $$ also belongs to $\mathcal{W}$. Leaks: If $\{\dot{x}_i = f_i(x_1 \ldots x_n)\}\in\mathcal{W}$, then systems transformed by $f_i\rightarrow f_i - k(x_i - h)$ is also in $\mathcal{W}$. Other stuff Anyway, not sure this is the right way of going about it.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'computer-science', 'mathematical-modeling']"

408890,Let G be a group of order 24 that is not isomorphic to S4. Then one of its Sylow subgroups is normal.,"Let G be a group of order 24 that is not isomorphic to S4. Then
  one of its Sylow subgroups is normal. This is the proof from my textbook . Proof Suppose that the 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal. The number of 3-Sylow
subgroups is 1 mod 3 and divides 8. Thus, if there is more than one 3-Sylow subgroup,
there must be four of them. Let X be the set of 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Then G acts on X by conjugation, so we
get a homomorphism $f : G â S(X) \cong S_4$. As weâve seen in the discussion on G-sets, the
kernel of f is the intersection of the isotropy subgroups of the elements of X. Moreover,
since the action is that given by conjugation, the isotropy subgroup of H â X is $N_G(H)$ (the normalizer of H in G). Thus, $$ker f = \cap_{H \in X} N_G(H).$$ For H â X, the index of $N_G(H)$ is 4, the number of conjugates of H. Thus, the order
of $N_G(H)$ is 6. Suppose that K is a different element of X. We claim that the order of
$N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ divides 2. To see this, note that the order of $N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ cannot be divisible by 3. This is
because any p-group contained in the normalizer of a p-Sylow subgroup must be contained in the p-Sylow subgroup itself (Corollary 5.3.5). Since the 3-Sylow subgroups have prime
order here, they cannot intersect unless they are equal. But if the order of $N_G(H) \cap N_G(K)$ divides 6 and is not divisible by 3, it must divide 2. In consequence, we see that the order of the kernel of f divides 2. If the kernel has
order 1, then f is an isomorphism, since G and $S_4$ have the same number of elements. Thus, we shall assume that ker f has order 2. In this case, the image of f has order
12. But by Problem 2 of Exercises 4.2.18, $A_4$ is the only subgroup of $S_4$ of order 12, so we must have im f = $A_4$. By Problem 1 of Exercises 4.2.18, the 2-Sylow subgroup, $P_2$, of $A_4$ is normal. But
since ker f has order 2, $f^{â1}P_2$ has order 8, and must be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. As
the pre-image of a normal subgroup, it must be normal, and weâre done. My Question I'm just confused about the last part. I kind of got lost when it was explaining how/why $f^{-1}P_2$ has order 8. I'm not really sure how that's related to the kernel of f. Thank you in advance","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
