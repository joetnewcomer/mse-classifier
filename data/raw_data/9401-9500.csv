71438,A version of Riemann's theorem,"Suppose that series $\sum^\infty_{n=1} u_n=s$ converges conditionally. Then for each $s'\gt s$ there exists a permutation of positive integers $\sigma:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that if $u_n\geq 0,$ then $\sigma(n)=n;$ $\sum^\infty_{n=1} u_{\sigma(n)}=s'.$ The standard proof of Riemann's theorem fails because of the condition (1). I know one construction which may give needed permutation, but I don't know how to prove the convergence. The construction is as follows. Denote $I_+=\{n\in \mathbb{N}:u_n\geq 0\}, \ I_-=\{n\in \mathbb{N}:u_n\lt 0\}$ - positions of positive and negative terms respectively. Choose infinite set $F\subset I_-,$ such that $\sum\limits_{n\in F} u_n\gt-\infty.$ The permutation $\sigma$ is built inductively. For  all $n\in I_+$ define $\sigma(n)=n.$ Next, on every position $n\in I_-$ permutation $\sigma$ puts elements of $F$ in their order. There exists first number $n_1$ such that $\sum\limits^{n_1}_{n=1} u_{\sigma(n)}\gt s'.$ The existence follows from the divergence $\sum\limits_{n\in I_+} u_n=\infty$ and convergence $\sum\limits_{n\in F} u_n\gt-\infty.$ After $n_1$ on each $n\in I_-$ permutation $\sigma$ puts elements of $I_-$ which were not used before in their order. There exists first number $n_2$ such that $\sum\limits^{n_2}_{n=1} u_{\sigma(n)}\lt s'.$ Existence follows from the fact that from some moment we'll obtain the permutation of series, which changes only finite number of points and converges to $s\lt s'.$ After $n_2$ at each position $n\in I_-$ put elements of $F,$ which were not used before, until first moment $n_3$ for which $\sum\limits^{n_3}_{n=1} u_{\sigma(n)}\gt s'.$ And so on. I know how to prove convergence of partial sums of new series to $s'$ for indices $n\in[n_{2p},n_{2p+1}],$ (where sums less then $s'$). Is it possible that infinitely often partial sums will exceed some $s'+\varepsilon?$","['divergent-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

71452,Characterisation of compact subsets of Banach spaces,"I have the following homework question: Characterize the compact subsets of the following Banach spaces: (1) The space $c_0$ of null sequences (that is, sequences $(x_n)$ of scalars with $ | x_n | \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$) with the norm $\|(x_n)\| = \sup_{n \geq 1} |x_n| = \max_{n \geq 1} |x_n|$. What I think could be an answer: If $(c_0, \| \cdot\|_\infty)$ is compact then by Ascoli-Arzelà a set is compact if and only if it is closed, bounded and equicontinuous. So I need to show that $c_0$ is compact and once I have that I claim that the closed bounded sets have the basis the closed balls in the metric induced by $\|\cdot\|_\infty$. Then I need to show that the sequences in these balls are equicontinuous. Edit Using your comments: Let $\mathbb{N}_\infty$ denote $\mathbb{N} \cup \{ \infty \}$. Then this space is compact (it is homeomorphic to $\{ 0 \} \cup \{ \frac{1}{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}$). Then $c_0$ is homeomorphic to $\{ x | x( \infty ) = 0 \} \subset C(\mathbb{N}_\infty)$. Therefore $K \subset c_0$ is compact iff $K$ is compact in $C(\mathbb{N}_\infty)$. Now Ascoli-Arzelà applies and so $K$ is compact iff $K$ is closed, bounded and equicontinuous. So I need to write down what closed, bounded, equicontinuous sets look like. I claim that they have the basis the closed balls in the metric induced by $\|\cdot\|_\infty$.

71510,"Relation between congruence subgroups. $\Gamma(M)\Gamma(N) = \Gamma(\gcd(M,N))$","I'm hoping there's a pleasant way to solve this one. Prove that $\Gamma(M)\Gamma(N) = \Gamma(\gcd(M,N))$. Showing that $\Gamma(M)\Gamma(N) \subset \Gamma(\gcd(M,N))$ is rather straight forward, but the other direction seems to involve solving a system of two systems of equations, which could be rather messy. I was wondering if any knows of a nicer way to attack this problem? Thanks! For completeness, I may as well show the direction I said was straight forward, though this is not necessarily important to my question, Let $\gamma_M\in\Gamma(M)$ and $\gamma_N\in\Gamma(N)$ be given by
$$ \gamma_M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b\\ c & d \end{pmatrix},$$
$$ \gamma_N = \begin{pmatrix} e & f\\ g & h \end{pmatrix}.$$
We can compute their product,
$$ \gamma_M\gamma_N = \begin{pmatrix} ae + bg & af + bh\\ ce + dg & cf + dh \end{pmatrix},$$
and notice that by the restrictions of $a,b,c,d$ modulo $M$ and $e,f,g,h$ modulo $N$ we know, letting $G = \gcd(M,N)$,
$$ ae + bg \equiv 1(\bmod\ G)$$
$$ af + bh \equiv 0(\bmod\ G)$$
$$ ce + dg \equiv 0(\bmod\ G)$$
$$ cf + dh \equiv 1(\bmod\ G)$$

71546,The uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$,"I'm working on a question from Topology by Munkres on p. 127 (Exercise #6). Here it is: Let $\bar{\rho}$ be the uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Given $\mathbb{x}= (x_1, x_2, ...) \in \mathbb{R}^\omega$ and given $0 < \epsilon < 1$, let $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon):= (x_1 - \epsilon, x_1 + \epsilon) \times \cdots \times (x_n - \epsilon, x_n + \epsilon) \times \cdots$. The question is divided into three parts, of which I have been able to answer the first and last parts of the problem. For the second part, i.e. part (b), I think I'm on the right track but I'm not too sure about that. Part (b) asks to show that $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$ is not even open in the uniform topology. In my attempt to do this part, I let $\mathbb{x}= \mathbb{0}= (0, 0, 0, 0, ...)$ and $\mathbb{y}= (0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...)$. Then I computed the distance
$\displaystyle\bar{\rho}(\mathbb{x}, \mathbb{y})= \sup_{i \geq 0}(\min\{|x_i - y_i|, 1\})= 1$. So that means the point $\mathbb{y}$ would not be in the open ball of radius $1$, i.e. $B_\bar{\rho}(\mathbb{x}, 1)$. So wouldn't this mean that we can't fit an $\epsilon$-ball around some point $\mathbb{y}$ that stays in $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$, and hence, $U(\mathbb{x}, \epsilon)$ is not open in the uniform topology induced by $\bar{\rho}$? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm just starting to learn topology, and still have a lot to learn! Interesting stuff, though.",['general-topology']

71740,necessary and sufficient condition for trivial kernel of a matrix over a commutative ring,"In answering Do these matrix rings have non-zero elements that are neither units nor zero divisors? I was surprised how hard it was to find anything on the Web about the generalization of the following fact to commutative rings: A square matrix over a field has trivial kernel if and only if its determinant is non-zero. As Bill demonstrated in the above question, a related fact about fields generalizes directly to commutative rings: A square matrix over a commutative ring is invertible if and only if its
  determinant is invertible. However, the kernel being trivial and the matrix being invertible are not equivalent for general rings, so the question arises what the proper generalization of the first fact is. Since it took me quite a lot of searching to find the answer to this rather basic question, and it's excplicitly encouraged to write a question and answer it to document something that might be useful to others, I thought I'd write this up here in an accessible form. So my questions are: What is the relationship between the determinant of a square matrix over a commutative ring and the triviality of its kernel? Can the simple relationship that holds for fields be generalized? And (generalizing with a view to the answer) what is a necessary and sufficient condition for a (not necessarily square) matrix over a commutative ring to have trivial kernel?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

71775,Extending the cube root function to $\mathbb{C}$,"On $\mathbb{R}$, the cube-root function (call it $f(x)$) is a well-defined single-valued function which is $C^\infty$ except at the origin.  ($f(27)=3$, $f(-27)=-3$, etc.) The complex cube root (call it $u(z)$) is triple-valued with branch points at $0$ and $\infty$, so any continuous single-valued branch requires us to exclude some curve connecting $0$ and $\infty$ from the domain.  The origin-centered circle $C_R$ of radius $R$ is thus mapped by $u$ (minus a point excluded from the domain) to an arc subtending an angle of $2\pi/3$ at the origin. It seems to me on geometrical grounds that this means no choice of domain for $u$ can make it restrict to $f$ on the real axis. The image of $C_R\cap \mathbb{R}$ under $f$ includes both $\sqrt[3]{R}$ and $-\sqrt[3]{R}$, but $u$ maps the whole of $C_R$, minus the excluded point, to an arc subtending an angle of less than $\pi$, which thus can't contain both a real number and its negative.

The normal curvature along a unit tangent direction $X \in TM$ can be expressed as $$ df(X) \cdot dN(X), $$ where $\cdot$ is the usual Euclidean inner product on $\mathbb{R}^3$.  The principal curvature directions $X_1, X_2 \in TM$ are the unit directions along which normal curvature is minimized and maximized, respectively.  It is a well-established fact that (away from umbilic points) these directions are orthogonal in the sense that $$ df(X_1) \cdot df(X_2) = 0. $$ Question 1 Is there any purely geometric intuition for why principal curvature directions are orthogonal?

It was, for example, used in this answer: Existence of a limit associated to an almost subadditive sequence . If $(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is a subadditive sequence of real numbers, i.e.,
$$(\forall m,n) a_{m+n} \le a_m + a_n,$$ 
then $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n}n = \inf_n \frac{a_n}n.$$ Some references are given in Wikipedia article, the original Fekete's paper is available here .
Basically the exponential version (for submultiplicative sequences) can be shown in a similar way as Satz II in this paper. I was wondering, whether some analogous claim is true for functions. I.e. something like: Whenever $f:{(0,\infty)}\to{\mathbb R}$ fulfills
$$(\forall x,y)f(x+y) \le f(x)+f(y)$$
(i.e., it is subadditive), then 
$$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}x = \inf_x \frac{f(x)}x.$$
(In particular, the above limit exists -- if we include the possibility $-\infty$.) Clearly, this is not true without any additional assumptions on $f$. (E.g. if $f$ is any non-linear solution of Cauchy's equation , then $\liminf \frac{f(x)}x < \limsup \frac{f(x)}x$ and $f$ is both subadditive and superadditive. Probably even much simpler examples can be given.) On the other hand, if $f$ is well-behaved, the above claim is true. If I assume that $f$ is bounded on intervals of the form $(0,x]$, then I can basically repeat the proof which is given for sequences here . So my question is: Under what assumptions on $f$ the above claim is true. Can you give some references for this claim? EDIT: I found a result which shows that measurability of $f$ is sufficient and added this result as an answer. I think this is sufficient for most applications and my guess is that there is not much space to improve this result. However, I will wait a little bit before accepting my own answer - just in case someone would like to add some interesting information or further useful references.

	m_{{pq}}(t)=\iint\limits_{R(t)}h(x,y) dx dy 
$$
where $	R(t)$ the domain of integration is time varying (In fact it is the only one which is time varying). And
$$
	h(x,y) = x^p y^q f(x,y) dx dy  
$$ In general, $f(x,y)$ is a 2 dimensional function projected onto the power basis. To provide more context, just imagine that $f(x,y)$ is a binary image with only 1 white object of some random shape having a contour C(t). With respect to time, the white object displaces itself in the image and thus the meaning of time varying domain. The function $f(x,y)$ does not vary with respect to time. (The intensities of the object int the image are going to be constant). If I need to differentiate the first equation $m_{{pq}}(t)$ to get the derivative w.r.t time, we can write $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dot{m}_{pq}=\oint\limits_{C(t)} h(x,y)\; \dot{\textbf{x}}^T \textbf{n}\,dl
    \label{eq:momentderiv}		
    \end{equation}
$$ where $\dot{\textbf{x}}$ is the velocity of the point $\textbf{x}$ in the x,y image plane $\textit{dl}$ is the infinitesimal increment along contour C(t) $\textbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the contour at any point $\textbf{x}$ on it. I am able to interpret the dot product between $\dot{\textbf{x}}$ and $\textbf{n}$ as the area of the infinitesimal surface between the contours at $C(t)$ and $C(t+dt)$. What i am not able to see is how exactly can the second equation be formally derived from the first equation? Further, by using the Green's theorem, the second equation (derivative of moment) above can be written in terms of divergence as
$$

	\dot{m}_{pq}= \iint\limits_{R(t)}\, \,div(h(x,y)\cdot\dot{\textbf{x}}) \,dx\,dy

72098,A few proofs of properties of a certain mapping on groups,"This is my first time using Stack Exchange, but it looks like a good resource. I am here to ask a couple questions about my homework. We're working from the latest edition of Abstract Algebra by Herstein. This is problem #3 from p. 73 of that book, and it reads as follows: Let $G$ be any group and $A(G)$ the set of all 1-1 mappings of $G$, as a set, onto itself. Define $L_{a} \colon G \to G$ by $L_{a}(x)=xa^{-1}$. Prove that: (a) $L_{a} = A(G)$. (b) $L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab}$. (c) The mapping $\psi:G \rightarrow A(G)$ defined by $\psi(a) = L_{a}$ is a monomorphism of G into A(G). I believe that I have answered parts b & c correctly, but have some concerns about the rigorousness of my approaches to all three problems. I will start out here by including my proposed solution to part a. Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated. (a) $A(G)$, as the set of all 1-1 mappings of $G$ onto itself, can be represented as the set of all operations on an element $x \in G$ such that the result is also in $G$. Since $G$ is a group, we know that this set can be represented as the set of all group multiplications $yx \mid x \in G, y \in G$ for a given element $x$. This is because any $x$ element can be fixed as the first parameter, while the $y$ elements are taken over every element of G. We have then that $yx \in G$, due to G's closure under group multiplication. Furthermore, any element $e \in G$ has an inverse element $e^{-1} \in G$, since $G$ is a group. This means that we can consider any element in $G$ as the inverse of its inverse: $e = (e^{-1})^{-1}$. This, when plugged in for our variable $x \in G$ above, gives us that $\forall x \in G, \forall y \in G, yx^{-1} \in G$. This is exactly our given mapping $L_{a}$ above, with the labels rearranged. This shows that $L_{a}$ is a mapping from $G \rightarrow G$, as required. In order to show why this set contains every such possible mapping, we will assume that there is a mapping $M_{a}(x) : G \rightarrow G$ such that $M_{a}(x) \notin L_{a}$. This mapping, as a mapping from G to G, must take the form of a group multiplication: $M_{a}(x) = x*a, x\in G$. However, since G is a group, we have again that $a = (a^{-1})^{-1}$, or, if we let $m = a^{-1}$, that $a = m^{-1}$, and so our mapping can be rewritten as $M_{a}(x) = x*m^{-1} m \in G$. However, this is exactly the same mapping as our above $L_{a}(x)$, showing that every mapping in $A(G)$ can indeed be written as a multiplication between some element $x \in G$ and another element's inverse $a^{-1} \in G$, and thus that $L_{a} \in A(G)$. $\blacksquare$ Thanks for taking the time to check this out, even if you don't feel you can offer any help. EDIT : Thanks to those who pointed out that I had used =, not $\in$, above by mistake. Also appreciated is the edit to italicize my variables. Now I know how to as well. :) EDIT : The responses so far have been so helpful, I'd like to put the other two parts of my solution up to solicit feedback on them as well. Hopefully they aren't as muddled as the first part's was. changed a bit in response to feedback (b)
        $L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$ $L_{b}(x) = xb^{-1}$ $(L_{a}L_{b})(x) = L_{a}(L_{b}(x))$ $L_{a}(L_{b}(x)) = L_{a}(xb^-1)$ $L_{a}(xb^-1) = xb^{-1}a^{-1}$ $xb^{-1}a^{-1} = x(ab)^{-1} = L_{ab}(x)$ $L_{a}(x)L_{b}(x) = L_{ab}(x) \quad\blacksquare$ (c)
$\psi(a) = L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$. To show that this mapping is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$, we will first rely on part (a) to state that $\psi(a) = L_{a}$ is indeed a mapping from $G$ to $A(G)$. Now we must show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. First we will show that $\psi$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. To this end, we will appeal to the results of our calculations in part (b) to state that $L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab}$, which of course implies that $\psi(a)\psi(b) = L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab} = \psi(ab)$, which proves that $\psi$ is a homomorphism. In order to continue and show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism, we must show that it is an injective (1-1) mapping. Let $\psi(a) = Z = \psi(b)$. This can be written as:
        $\psi(a) = L_{a}(e) = ea^{-1} = Z$ $\psi(b) = L_{b}(e) = eb^{-1} = Z$ $Z = ea^{-1} = eb^{-1}$ $a^{-1} = b^{-1} \Rightarrow a = b$ The last line of the above follows from the uniqueness of inverse elements in $G$. This shows that the only way for two output values of $\psi$ to be equal is for their inputs to be equal as well, and thus $\psi$ is an injective homomorphism, or a monomorphism from $G$ to $A(G)$. $\blacksquare$",['group-theory']

That would be because the set $\mathbb{Q}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. The irrationals is also a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Basically, my thought is that the continuum is composed of irrationals and rationals (only two subsets of reals). Because we can prove that the rationals are countable by Cantor's proof, then the remaining subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, the irrationals, has to be uncountable for $\mathbb{R}$ to be uncountable.

Since a countable space is clearly separable, you can use Urysohn's characterization of separable metric spaces to replace metrizeable with 2nd countable, regular (I take regular to mean regular and Hausdorff). You could even get away with 1st countable, regular since, for a countable space, 1st countable implies 2nd countable. My question is, what happens if we try to relax metrizability to regularity? Is the space automatically 1st countable (and hence homeomorphic to the rationals)? To summarize: Is there a countable space $X$ which is regular Hausdorff with no isolated points, but not 1st countable?

72160,Simple functions and axiom of choice,"The question I have is more of a curiosity, and that is why I decided to post here instead of Mathoverflow. Before posing the question, let me set up some background. Background: Let $\Omega$ be a Boolean algebra. For the purposes of this post a measure $\nu$ on $\Omega$ is a finitely additive map $\Omega\to A$ with values in a linear space $A$. If $A$ is a commutative, unital algebra, $\nu$ is multiplicative or spectral if $\nu(E\cap F)= \nu(E)\nu(F)$ and $\nu(1)= 1$. I will denote by $\mathbf{A}(\Omega, V)$ the linear space of $V$-measures on $\Omega$ and by $\mathbf{AS}(\Omega, A)$ the set of spectral measures. note: the field of scalars is irrelevant; take the real field for the sake of determinateness. Theorem 1: The functor $V\mapsto \mathbf{A}(\Omega, V)$ is representable, that is, there is a linear space $S(\Omega)$ and a natural isomorphism $\mathbf{A}(\Omega, V)\cong \mathbf{Vect}(S(\Omega), V)$. $S(\Omega)$ is the space of simple elements . Denote by $\chi$ the universal measure $\Omega\to S(\Omega)$ and call elements of the form $\chi(E)$ characteristic . note: By Stone duality, $S(\Omega)$ is isomorphic to the linear space of linear combinations of characteristic functions of clopen sets of the Stone space of $\Omega$. Thus the monikers ""simple"" and ""characteristic elements"". Stone duality needs the Boolean prime ideal theorem. We can introduce a commutative unital algebra structure on $S(\Omega)$ by $\chi(E)\chi(F)= \chi(E\cap F)$ and then extending linearly (or juggling around the universal property). $\chi$ is now spectral and in fact the universal spectral measure. Theorem 2: The functor $A\mapsto \mathbf{AS}(\Omega, A)$ is naturally isomorphic to $\mathbf{CAlg}(S(\Omega), A)$. In fact, we have a functor $\mathbf{CAlg}\to \mathbf{Bool}$ that sends a commutative, unital algebra to the Boolean algebra of its idempotents. It is now easy to see that this functor is right adjoint to $S$ and, in particular, $S$ is cocontinuous. Problem: An easy application of the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI for short) implies that if $E\in \Omega$ is non-zero then $\chi(E)$ is likewise non-zero. In particular, $S(\Omega)$ is non-trivial ($0\neq 1$). Conversely, it is not difficult to see that if $1\neq 0$ then if $E\in \Omega$ is non-zero then $\chi(E)$ is non-zero. My question is can the non-triviality of $S(\Omega)$ be proved without recourse to the BPI? Say, in ZF alone? ZF + P with some P weaker than BPI? note: BPI is weaker than AC by a well-known result of Halpern and Levy. Here is what I managed to do until now. Theorem 2 guarantees that as long as we have a non-trivial spectral measure on $\Omega$, non-triviality of $S(\Omega)$ drops out. $S$ of the initial Boolean algebra (the non-trivial one constituted solely by the bottom and top elements) is the scalar field, thus, if we have an ultrafilter on $\Omega$ we can prove that $S(\Omega)$ is non-trivial. In particular, if $\Omega$ has even just one atom we are done. But I am at a loss as how to proceed in the case of arbitrary atomless algebras. If we can factor some morphism into a Boolean algebra with non-trivial $S$ then the problem would also be solved, but this is really not an advancement over constructing ultrafilters directly. At this point, and after not managing to get non-triviality of $S(\Omega)$ without BPI I started wondering if non-triviality of $S(\Omega)$ is actually equivalent to BPI, but the only thing I accomplished is to narrow down to the problem of constructing one algebra morphism from $S(\Omega)$ to the real field -- not much, that is.","['logic', 'boolean-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'axiom-of-choice']"

72191,Boundedness of functions,"Recently in my problem solving class we had the question: If $f: [0,\infty) \to \Bbb R$ is a twice differentiable function such that $f''(x) + e^x f(x) = 0$, then prove that $f$ is bounded. The solution I found was to create a function $g(x)=f(x)^2 + e^{-x}f'(x)^2$. Looking at $g'$, we have $$g'=2ff' -e^{-x}f'^2 + 2e^{-x}f'f''$$ $$g'=-e^{-x}f'^2+2ff'+2e^{-x}f'f''$$ $$g' = -e^{-x}f'^2 +2e^{-x}f' \left(e^xf + f'' \right) = -e^{-x}f'^2 \leq 0$$ Thus we have that $g$ is a decreasing function. This means that for $x>0$, we have $$g(x) \leq g(0)$$ Since $g(0)=R$ for some constant $R$, we have $$R \geq g(x)=f(x)^2+e^{-x}f'(x)^2 > f(x)^2$$ thus $f^2$ is bounded, so $f$ itself must be bounded. It is not so hard to show that this works if we replace $e^x$ with any differentiable function $k(x)$ that is positive and increasing on $[0,\infty)$. Thus we have the more general result that if $f: [0,\infty) \to \Bbb R$ is a twice differentiable function such that $f''(x) + k(x) f(x) = 0$ on $[a,\infty)$ for some $a \geq 0$ and $k(x)$ is positive, increasing , and differentiable on $[a,\infty)$, then $f$ is bounded. However, my teacher also gave us a similar problem: if $f: [0,\infty) \to \Bbb R$ is a twice differentiable function such that $f''(x) + \frac{1}{x} f(x) = 0$ on $[a,\infty)$ for some $a > 0$, then $f$ is bounded above. Unfortunately for us, our above result does not apply, since $\frac{1}{x}$ is decreasing , rather than increasing on $[a,\infty)$. In fact, defining $g(x)$ analogously as $g(x)=f(x)^2+xf'(x)^2$ gives us that $g' \geq 0$, so the technique fails. All similarly defined functions in terms of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ that I've tried have also failed to tell me anything about the boundedness of $f$. However, since there is a degree of intuition required for competition type problems like this, it's certainly very very likely that I missed one that does work. I will mention that defining  $h(x) = \frac{1}{x}f(x)^2 + f'(x)^2$ does tell us that $f'$ must be bounded, but I couldn't get anything about the boundedness of $f$ out of this.

Since the problem involving $e^x$ generalizes very nicely to all increasing, positive, differentiable functions, I imagine that a solution of the problem involving $\frac{1}{x}$ would also generalize to all decreasing, positive, differentiable functions, so a proof of this could possibly provide a very interesting result concerning boundedness of functions that satisfy relatively simple differential equations. I've hit a bit of an impasse in solving this problem and I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions on how to prove this.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"
72193,"Minimal dense subset of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$","The following question was a problem in an Analysis exam: Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Define $A_{n} := \displaystyle \left\{\frac{k}{2^n} \bigg|  k \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \leq k \leq 2^n \right\}$. Let $A_{\infty} = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$ . Compute $\overline{A_{\infty}}$ (closure of $A_{\infty}$) and $A_{\infty}^{\circ}$ (the interior of $A_{\infty}$). I have solved the problem. I got the answer as $\overline{A_{\infty}} = [0,1]$ and $A_{\infty}^{\circ} = \phi$. But as I wondered about the problem, I observed that $A_{\infty}$ was a strict subset of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ and was still dense in $[0,1]$. This set me thinking; I asked myself if can I get a minimally dense (in $[0,1]$) subset of $A_{\infty}$? So I defined $P_{\infty} = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} P_n$ where $P_n := \displaystyle \left\{\frac{k}{2^n} \bigg|  k \in \mathbb{Z}, k \text{ is prime } , 0 \leq k \leq 2^n \right\}$. And then I defined $D_n := A_n \setminus P_n$ and $D_{\infty}$ appropriately. I could show that $D_{\infty}$ is dense in $[0,1]$ and that it is a strict subset of $A_{\infty}$. So I have up to two questions: (dense always means dense in $[0,1]$ in the following questions) 0)Does there exist a minimally dense subset of $\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$? If it does, how do we find it? 1) Does there exist a minimally dense subset of $A_{\infty}$? If it does, how do we find it? 2) Is $P_{\infty}$ dense? Thanks,

72210,"Incomplete ""round trip"" of taking a minimum, then a maximum, from a positively skewed distribution","Let's say you have a distribution that is either symmetric or positively skewed (and defined over 0-1).  Call it F. Then, you find the distribution of the minimum of n>1 draws from F.  Call it Fmin. Clearly the mean of Fmin is less than the mean of F. Now, find the distribution of the maximum of the same number n draws from Fmin.  Call it Fminimax. The mean of Fminimax is of course greater than the mean of Fmin.  However, the increase from Fmin to Fminimax is less in magnitude than the original decrease from F to Fmin.  Meaning, that the ""round trip"" is not complete, and the minimax operation ends up lowering the mean. What I meant to ask, was, does this single operation lower the mean for any non-negatively skewed distribution? I deleted a bunch of stuff from the question that I think I made a mess out of.  But, I can always revert the changes if anyone objects.","['inequality', 'sequences-and-series', 'statistics', 'recursive-algorithms', 'economics']"
72219,Extracting individual race results from Mario Kart final scores,"In Mario Kart, one ""cup"" involves 4 races, and after every race each racer gets points awarded based on what place they came in (better rank means more points). After playing it enough I grew curious about the mathematical problem of trying to reason backwards from the final scores to the individual race results - when is it possible and how might one do it? Formally, the problem goes like this: suppose we have a scoring vector $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ with components that are strictly decreasing with index. There are $r$ permutation matrices $P_1,P_2,\dots,P_r$ that we don't have, but we do have the final score vector $\mathbf{f}=(P_1+P_2+\cdots+P_r)\mathbf{v}$. What conditions on our information - $\mathbf{v},r,\mathbf{f}$ - allow there to be a unique solution, and how might we go about computing them? I imagine if $r$ is small enough compared to $n$ and the scoring vector $\mathbf{v}$ is ""sparse"" or the components ""independent"" enough (a fuzzy intuition), there will probably be a unique solution, but it doesn't look at all amenable to linear algebra methods that I know of. More generally, we could understand the scoring vector to hail from a different type of vector space, or understand the score-distributing matrices $P_i$ to be from a different candidate set than permutation matrices (perhaps from a group representation of something other than the symmetric group?).","['linear-algebra', 'recreational-mathematics', 'algorithms']"
