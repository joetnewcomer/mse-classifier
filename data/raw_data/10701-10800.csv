81974,"Why finite morphisms between schemes are defined in a different sense of ""local"" with morphisms of finite type?","A finite morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ firstly requires an affine cover $V_i\subset Y$, such that $f^{-1}(V_i)$ are affine open sets. However a morphism of (locally) finite type $f:X\rightarrow Y$ involves a cover $V_i\subset Y$ such that $f^{-1}(V_i)$ can be covered by affine open sets. The latter sense of local must be broader than the first one. Why are the first part of their definition so different?

82070,Elementary question on Sums notation,"I reading on Sums and I am reading about the difference between using a generalized Sigma notation and the delimited form.  Ok, I understand that the generalized form is more expressive. But I found the following example confusing to me: It says: In the following we can change the index variable from $k$ to $k+1$ and easily do the substitution:
  $$
\sum_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} a_k = \sum_{1 \leqslant k+1 \leqslant n} a_{k+1}.
$$ But with the delimited form we have: $$
\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{k+1};
$$ and is harder to make a mistake. My question is the following: In the generalized form the index is expressed to be $k+1$ in the notation so we have $k+1=1$, $k+1=2$. But why is the comparison done like this? I mean shouldn't we have in the right hand of the delimited form $k+1=1$ instead? I.e. $$
\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \sum_{{\Large \mathbf{k+1=1}}}^n a_{k+1}.

82096,What applications of the Residue Theorem to real integration have had the biggest impact outside of pure math?,"A typical undergraduate student (at least in North America) learns about integration of real-valued functions of one real variable, and learns some of its applications to science and probability, e.g. computing things like mass, charge, work, or the expected value of a continuous random variable.  They are also taught several techniques of integration such as change of variables, integration by parts, partial fraction decomposition, etc.  At some point later one, they learn some complex analysis, and in particular the Residue Theorem.  With some ingenuity, one can use this theorem about integrating complex functions over curves in the complex plane to compute integrals of real functions over (parts of) the real line, e.g.: $$\int_0^\infty\frac{\cos(ax)}{x^2+1}dx\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  (a > 0)$$ My question is as in the title.

82112,Proof of Bochner formula/ Weitzenböck formula in a non-normal frame,"The proof of the classical  Weitzenböck  formula $$
\Delta (|f|^2)=|{\rm Hess}f|^2+\langle\nabla f, \nabla (\Delta f) +{\rm Ric} (\nabla f, \nabla f) \rangle
$$ uses the local orthonormal frame field $X_i$ around any fixed point $p\in M$ satisfy 
$$
\langle X_i, X_j \rangle =\delta_{ij}, \ \ \nabla_{X_i}X_j(p)=0
$$
to simplify the calculation. My question is: What if I start with arbitary orthonormal fram say $\{e_1, \cdots, e_n\}$.
My calculation shows that for any fixed $\alpha=1,\cdots,n$, the following holds:
$$
\begin{align}
{\rm Hess}(|\nabla f|^2)(e_{\alpha}, e_{\alpha})= &2|\nabla f|^2 {\rm sec}(\nabla f, e_{\alpha}) + 2\nabla f \langle \nabla_{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f, e_{\alpha}\rangle +2 \langle \nabla _{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f, \nabla_{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f\rangle \\
&- 4\langle \nabla_{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f, \nabla_{\nabla f}e_{\alpha}\rangle
\end{align}
$$
Where the ${\rm sec}$ denotes the sectional curvature spaned by $\nabla f$ and $e_{\alpha}$, . The only difference between the standard calculation using normal fram and mine is the term $$- 4\langle \nabla_{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f, \nabla_{\nabla f}e_{\alpha}\rangle
$$
So it means after summing up over $1, \cdots , n$, we must get $0$. i.e.
$$
\sum_{\alpha} - 4\langle \nabla_{e_{\alpha}}\nabla f, \nabla_{\nabla f}e_{\alpha}\rangle=0
$$
But this seems not obvious to me. Did I miss something? The classical calculation can be found here:

82129,Riemann surfaces are algebraic,"Via a very ample divisor one can embed a Riemann surface holomorphically into some $\mathbb{P}^n$. Now, we can then project the Riemann surface to $\mathbb{P}^3$, and we can even go until $\mathbb{P}^2$ if we allow nodes. If we have a Riemann surface $X$ and an embedding $f:X\to \mathbb{P}^2$ (where the image is smooth), then we can find the equation for $f(X)$ (you pull back the meromorphic functions $x_0/x_1$ and $x_1/x_2$ via $f$, where $x_0,x_1,x_2$ are the homogeneous coordinates of $\mathbb{P}^2$; these are algebraically dependent over $\mathbb{C}$, and thus they must satisfy some polynomial. The projective closure of the zeroes of this polynomial is exactly $f(X)$). I've been reading Shafarevich's book Algebraic Geometry I , and on page 86 he describes how to find the equations for a mapping to $\mathbb{P}^n$. He simply states that if you have a map from $X$ to $\mathbb{P}^n$, then since we can project, we can reduce to the case that the map goes to $\mathbb{P}^2$, and we're basically done. If the Riemann surface is in $\mathbb{P}^3$, for example, I don't see why the above method guarantees that it be defined by equations... It's image in $\mathbb{P}^2$ would possibly have nodes... Any ideas? I'm looking to show that a compact Riemann surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is algebraic, that is, can be defined by polynomial equations.","['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"

82242,Constructing a Measure from a Function,"A well-known result is that we can always construct a countably additive function $\mu$ from a nondecreasing and right-continuous function $G$. More specifically, we define on the semiring $\mathcal{C}$ of all intervals $(a,b]$,
$$\mu((a,b])=G(b)-G(a),$$
where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure when $G$ is the identity mapping. I'm curious if the following function gets this property as well: Fix a countable set $C=\{c_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$ where each $c_n$ is distinct, and a countable set $\{a_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$ where each $a_n$ is non-negative and $\sum_na_n<\infty$. Define $G:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that
$$x\longmapsto\sum\{a_n:c_n\leq x\}.$$ That is, is this function right-continuous and non-decreasing? Furthermore, does the measure $\mu$ constructed from this function satisfy $\mu(\{c_n\})=a_n$ and $\mu(\mathbb{R}\backslash C)=0?$ EDIT: $G$ being right-continuous and non-decreasing seems pretty easy to see. Non-decreasing is rather obvious from the property of the $a_n$'s and I basically argued right-continuity to myself in the comment box below. However for the second part, I'm not sure how to approach either property. How do you interpret $\mu(\{c_n\})$ to get only $a_n$ remaining in the subtraction?

  $$f_n=\frac{(x+1)^n-(x^n+1)}{x}.$$
  Question is whether this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbf{Q}$ for arbitrary $n \geq 1$. In the document you may find a proof that polynomial is irreducible whenever $n=2p , p \in \mathbf{P}$ and below is my attempt to prove that polynomial isn't irreducible whenever $n$ is odd number greater than $3$. Assuming that my proof is correct my question is : Is this polynomial irreducible over $\mathbf{Q}$ when $n=2k , k\in \mathbf{Z^+}$ \ $\mathbf{P} $ ? Lemma 1: For odd $n$, $a^n + b^n = (a+b)(a^{n-1} - a^{n-2} b + \cdots + b^{n-1})$. Binomial expansion: $(a+b)^n = \binom{n}{0} a^n + \binom{n}{1} a^{n-1} b + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} b^n$.
$$\begin{align*} f(x)  &= \frac{(x+1)^n - x^n-1}{x} = \frac{(x+1)^n - (x^n+1)}{x}

\\ &= \frac{(x+1) \cdot \left[ \Bigl(\binom{n-1}{0}x^{n-1}+ \binom{n-1}{1} x^{n-2} + \cdots + 1 \Bigr) - (x^{n-1}-x^{n-2}+ \cdots + 1) \right]}{x}

My answer: (i) (by contradiction) Assume for all $x_n \in X$ with $\| x_n \|_X = 1$ that $$x_n^\ast (x_n) < \frac{\| x_n^\ast \|}{2} \iff 2 x_n^\ast (x_n) < \sup_{x_n; \| x_n \|_X = 1 } \{ | x_n^\ast(x_n) | \}$$ Claim: Then $\exists r \in \mathbb{R}: x_n^\ast(x_n) < r < \sup_{\dots}\{\dots \}$: (i) $x_n^\ast (x_n) \neq 0$: because $\| x_n \| = 1$ and $x_n^\ast$ linear (ii) if $x_n^\ast (x_n) < 0$ then 
$2 x_n^\ast (x_n) < x_n^\ast (x_n) < x_n^\ast(- x_n) < 2 x_n^\ast(-x_n) < \sup_{\dots} \{ \dots \}$ (iii) $x_n^\ast(x_n) > 0$ then $\forall x_n: x_n^\ast (x_n) < 2 x_n^\ast (x_n) < \sup$ $\implies $ the $\sup$ is not the l.u.b., contradiction, so the claim $x_n^\ast (x_n) \geq \frac{\| x_n^\ast \|}{2}$ is true. (ii) Using: $ x \in \overline{Y} \iff \lnot \exists $ bounded linear functional $f^\ast$ such that $f^\ast (y ) = 0 \forall y \in Y$ and $f^\ast (x) \neq 0$ Let $f^\ast \in X^\ast$.

$$| x_n^\ast (x_n)| \geq x_n^\ast (x_n) \geq \frac{\| x_n \|}{2} > 0$$ so if $f^\ast (y) = 0 \forall y \in Y$ then $$ 0 < \frac{\| x_n \|}{2} \leq |x_n^\ast (x_n)| = |x_n^\ast (x_n) - f^\ast(x_n)|$$ $$ \implies \exists \varepsilon: \sup |x_n^\ast (x_n) - f^\ast(x_n)| > \varepsilon$$ $$ \implies \lnot \exists f^\ast \in X^\ast : \forall y \in Y: f^\ast (y) = 0$$ $$ x \in \overline{Y}$$ Thanks for your help.","['dual-spaces', 'separable-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

$$ x_{n + 2} = \frac{2 \alpha + (1 + \alpha)x_n}{(1 + \alpha) + 2x_n}$$ Another idea I had using the second form of the equation was to write $x_{n + 1}$ as $$ x_{n + 1} = x_1 + \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) $$
where 
$$f(k) = \frac{\alpha - x_k^2}{1 + x_k}$$ But once again I don't see where to go. I've been looking at the problem Martin posted and this is what I have gotten. Since $x_1 > \sqrt{\alpha}$, so $x_1 = \sqrt{\alpha} + \epsilon$. $$x_2 = \frac{\alpha + x_1}{1 + x_1} 
= \frac{\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha}(1 + \epsilon)}{1 + \sqrt{\alpha}(1 + \epsilon} = \sqrt{\alpha}\left( \frac{\sqrt{\alpha} + 1 + \epsilon}{\sqrt{\alpha} + 1 + \sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon} \right) \le \sqrt{\alpha}\left( 1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\alpha} - 1}{\sqrt{\alpha} + 1} \right)\epsilon \right)$$ Then they use 3/2, but I dont see a way to base that on $\alpha$ instead.",['analysis']

The Galois group $G(K/F)$ is the set of all automorphisms of $K$ which fix every element of $F$.

82535,How equal are a series and its sum?,"This is a question about the logic of mathematical language concerning infinite series. It's normal to say $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}=2$.  This type of equation is often given in the form of a notational introduction within the definition of ""converge(nt)"".  But it's also normal to assert things about $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}$ and deny the corresponding statements about $2$: $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}$ converges, but $2$  does not ""converge"". $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}$ is an infinite series, but $2$ is not. On the surface, this looks like a violation of the basic substitutability of equals for equals.
I see two possible explanations: First, the problem result from talking about $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}$ but implicitly referring to its form.  For example, in ""6/3 is a fraction but 2 is not"", the idea ""is a fraction"" refers not to the value of 6/3 but to its form.  This seems plausible and attractive, especially for saying ""is an infinite series"", but it seems to be a stretch for ""converges"".  For example, to say that a nested sum $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \ \sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty \ldots$ ""converges"" (treating it as a sum on $n$), we require that the inner sums be evaluated.  This does not feel like a description of form alone. Second, the problem might occur because the equality of $ \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n}=2$ is not in fact sincere equality:  It means something other than logical identity.  This interpretation is strongly favored by the fact that it appears in a definition!  (Presumably we would not be entitled to redefine logical identity.)  Thus there is no reason to expect substitutability, and there is no problem.  But this seems disingenuous:  In many contexts, we freely substitute series and their sums.  We also use this ""$=$"" symbol symmetrically and transitively, mixing it without comment with normal equality. Have I correctly understood normal usage?  Is either of these interpretations the ""correct"" one?  Is there a ""logician's solution""?","['logic', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

Here is what I did: I proved that the pointwise limit of $\{ f_{n} \}$ is the function $f( x ) = \frac{x^2}{4\pi}$.

we get:

Can anyone give me a detailed proof how to get that inequality given by the book? From that point, I can easily prove the uniform convergence. For the uniform convergence on $\mathbb R$, there is hint saying that I should use $| \sin x | \leqslant \left | x \right |$ to get:

I was trying to show that if $X$ is a topological space and $F, G$ are sheaves of sets on $X$, then a morphism of sheaves $\eta: F \rightarrow G$ is a monomorphism if and only if the induced maps on stalks are injective (**). There is probably a way to prove this without using the fact that the components of $\eta$ are monic (i.e. injective set functions in this case), but I already know from an argument using the Yoneda Lemma that in this particular case because my target category is the category of sets, $\eta$ is a monomorphism if and only if each of its components are (and the proof of (**) is quite elementary, once I know this fact). Also, I am not aware of a proof of the fact that $\eta$ is an epimorphism iff every component of $\eta$ is an epimorphism, even when the target category is the category of sets. So, is this statement true when the target category is the category of sets?

In that case, any known conditions on $C$ and $D$ for which my question holds will also suffice.)","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

For the second situation, we have $f(x)=3x+5$ and $h(x)=3x^2+3x+2$; find $g$ such that $f(g(x))=h$. I think  for first   because degree of $h$ is $2$, we should choose $f$ as $ax^2+bx+c$; and for second also, quadratic form. Am I correct? Please if something is incorrect in my logic, please inform me.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'solution-verification']"
82786,Showing that a real function is convex,"How can I show that if $\varphi$ is a real function such that $$\varphi \left(\int_0^1 f\right)\leqslant \int_0^1 \varphi (f)$$ 
for any Borel-measurable real function $f$, then $\varphi$ is convex. Ps: I realize homework questions have to be tagged as such. This isn't a homework problem. I came across this question in a text book, and I thought it was interesting.",['analysis']
82787,Probability of two independent standard normal random variables,"Suppose we have $X,Y$, two independent standard normal random variables. How can we calculate $P(|\min(X,Y)|<1)$. I am still learning multivariables probability, and I also realize there are a lot of nice properties of two standard normal r.vs but I am not sure how to use them.",['probability']
82788,Why can't I use the disk method to compute surface area? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Areas versus volumes of revolution I was trying to brush up on Calculus since I haven't used it in years. I wanted to derive formulas for volume and surface area of a sphere of radius r . I got volume right, but for surface area I'm getting the wrong answer. I start with the equation for the half of a circle of radius r centered at the origin with positive y coordinates: $$f(x) = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$$ So I started by breaking it up into disks, with radius f(x) and height dx , and integrating the surface area of the outside of the disks. (Which is to say, circumference of disk multiplied by height of disk.) $$dA = 2 \pi f(x) dx$$
$$A = \int_{-r}^r dA$$
$$ = 2 \pi \int_{-r}^r f(x) dx$$ Now, I don't know how to integrate f(x) symbolically, but logically if the integral is the area under the curve from -r to r , it would be half the area of a circle of radius r , giving: $$ = 2 \pi (\frac{\pi r^2}{2})$$
$$ = \pi^2 r^2$$ Of course, this is not the correct answer. Am I making an error in my math, or does the disk method just not work for surface area? (And if not, why does it work for volume?)","['calculus', 'integration']"
82802,Why to use such a complex definition of intersection multiplicity?,"Let $X$ be a smooth variety and $V, W$ two closed irreducible and reduced subvarieties represented by ideal sheaves $I$ and $J$. Serre defines an intersection multiplicity for an irreducible component $Z$ of $V\cap W$ as
$$
\mu(Z;V,W)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^i \operatorname{length}_{\mathcal{O}_{X,z}} (\operatorname{Tor}^i_{\mathcal{O}_{Z,z}}(\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/I,\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/J))
$$
where $z$ is the generic point of $Z$. The first summand of this sum is
$$
\operatorname{length}_{\mathcal{O}_{X,z}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/I \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X,z}}\mathcal{O}_{X,z}/J) = \operatorname{length}_{\mathcal{O}_{X,z}}(\mathcal{O}_{Z,z})
$$
and this is what has a geometric interpretation as the intersection multiplicity for me. Can someone explain to me at a concrete geometric example, why the ""naive definition"" isn't sufficient? In which often appearing cases is it sufficient?",['algebraic-geometry']
