2075946,"I found a new way of calculating pi,is that a great deal? [closed]",Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 7 years ago . Improve this question I am a 15 year old teen and fond of mathematics.  I always try to prove mathematical theories and I tried to find how to get pi using an algorithm.  Then I found out a way and made an algorithm and inserted it in an Excel sheet and it gave out the first 15 digits after the decimal sign.  I just want to know if this is a great deal?,"['circles', 'pi', 'geometry']"

2075969,Self-adjoint bounded operators in a Hilbert space,"Let $A$ be a bounded operator on complex Hilbert space $H$ that is not self-adjoint. Let $\epsilon>0$ and define $R_{\epsilon}=\{T\in B(H):||A-T||<\epsilon\}$. How do I prove that there exists an $\epsilon$ such that $R_{\epsilon}$ contains no self-adjoint bounded operators on $H$? What I thought: We need to show that for $T\in R_{\epsilon}$ we have $T\neq T^*$. We know that the map $f:B(H)\rightarrow B(H)$ with $f(T)=T-T^*$ is continuous. So there exists an $\delta>0$ such that for all $\epsilon>0$ we have for $||T_1-T_2||<\delta$ that
$$||T_1-T_1^*-T_2+T_2^*||<\epsilon.$$
Further I know that $f$ has kernel the self-adjoint operators, but how can I use all this for the proof?","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'adjoint-operators']"

For example, if $x=2$ and $c=i$ , we have $b_1=2^i=\operatorname{cis}(\ln2)$ $b_2=2^{\operatorname{cis}(\ln2)}=2^{\cos(\ln2)}\operatorname{cis}(\ln2\sin(\ln2))$ etc. I haven't much clue as to whether it is the case that $b_n$ can converge when $a_n$ diverges, and I can hardly work out if $b_n$ converges with $x=2$ and $c=i$ .","['tetration', 'complex-dynamics', 'sequences-and-series', 'exponentiation']"

2076045,"Factorization of $(1+2i)z^2+6iz+2i-1$ to find the residues, but it doesn't work","I'm doing complex analysis and I have the following $$\int_{C}\frac{2dz}{(2i+1)z^2+6iz+2i-1}$$ where $C$ is the unit circle. I tried factorizing this polynomial and find the residues but I really can't solve this. This is my work:
$$z_{1,2} = \frac{-3i\pm \sqrt{-9-(-4-1)} }{2i+1}=\frac{-3i\pm 2i}{1+2i} \cdot \frac{1-2i}{1-2i}= \frac{-3i-6\pm 2i\pm 4}{5}$$ which gives $z_1 = -\frac{2}{5}-\frac{i}{5}$ and $z_2 = -2-i$. Now clearly $z_2$ is outside the unit circle so I just have to consider the residue of $z_1$. However I think I'm either making a factorisation mistake or a mistake in the roots. Indeed if we check the roots, I don't get the same polynomial! $$(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right) = z^2 +z\left(\frac{12}{5}+\frac{6i}{5}\right)+\frac{4i}{5}+\frac{3}{5}$$ which is clearly not the same polynomial I started with. Also if I try to calculate the residue using the limit, I don't get the correct one. Where's my mistake? EDIT As requested, I'll add some more calculations. To calculate the residue I did the following: $$\lim_{z\to z_1}(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5})\frac{2}{(z+2+i)\left(z+\frac{2}{5}+\frac{i}{5}\right)} = \frac{2}{\frac{8}{5}+\frac{4i}{5}} = \frac{5}{4+2i} = \frac{20-10i}{20}=1-\frac{i}{2}$$ which is clearly wrong as this integral is the mapping of a real integral of the first type (rational function in sine and cosine). Indeed by Cauchy's Residue Theorem this should give that the value of the initial real integral is $2\pi i (1-\frac{i}{2}) = 2\pi i+\pi$ which is a complex value, so this is wrong","['algebra-precalculus', 'complex-analysis', 'polynomials', 'factoring']"
2076097,Predicting sign of a Trigonometric Function in Intervals.,"What are the different ways one can predict the sign of Trigonometric functions. The function may contain combination of different functions. let us suppose I have a function f(x)= sin(2x) - cos(3x) Now I want to predict the sign of this function in the interval [0,2π] . Is there any mechanical (doing some math calculations) approach or it is a matter of fact that you have to remember the graphs of both the functions and have a good idea of what will be the result (without actually calculating any thing). However I can predict the nature of the function f(x) using this graph [pink-->Resultant || green-->cos(3x) || violet-->sin(2x)] ] 1 please admit if you have some shortcut or any trick to quickly predict the sign.

2076161,A prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $P(x)$ splits into distinct linear factors modulo $p$.,"In this answer, one can read: Let $P \in \Bbb Z[X]$.
  Let $K$ be the splitting field of $P(x)$. A prime $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if$^1$ $P(x)$ splits into distinct linear factors modulo $p$. 1 With finitely many exceptions, related to the fact that the ring of integers in $K$ may not be $\mathbb{Z}[x]/P(x)$. Question: I would like to know the precise statement of this claim (e.g. what are these ""finitely many exceptions""), and how to prove this statement. I am aware of Dedekind's factorization theorem, stated here : Let $K$ be  a  number   field  and $a \in O_K$ such  that $K=\Bbb Q(a)$. 
  Let $f(T)$ be  the  minimal  polynomial  of $a$ in $\Bbb Z[T]$.  For  any  prime $p$ not  dividing $[O_K:\Bbb Z[a]]$,write
  $$f(T) = \pi_1(T)^{e_1}\cdots \pi_r(T)^{e_r} \pmod p,$$ where  the $\pi(T)$'s  are  distinct  monic  irreducibles  in $\Bbb Fp[T]$.   Then $(p) =pO_K$ factors  into prime ideals as
  $$(p) = P_1^{e_1}\cdots P_r^{e_r},$$ where there is a bijection between the $P_i$'s and $\pi(T)$'s such that $N(P_i)=p^{deg(\pi_i)}$. In order to prove $\Longleftarrow$ in the statement above, I would like to apply Dedekind's factorization theorem. But I don't know how I could take $P(T)=f(T)$, i.e. $P$ is the minimal polynomial of an element $a \in O_K$ such that $K=\Bbb Q(a)$ (only knowing that the roots of $P$ are $r_1,\dots,r_n$ such that $K=\Bbb Q(r_1,\dots,r_n)$).

For $|x|<1$, I've combined the Lambert series for the Möbius function ( see this Wikipedia if you need it ) with the Generalized Binomial Theorem that provide us the derivative of the inverse sine (that is the first power of this trigonometric function). Multiply by $\frac{1}{4^k}\binom{2k}{k}$ the evaluation of the Lambert series at $x^{2k}$ and after take the sum $\sum_{k\geq 1}$, then you get $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{4^k}\binom{2k}{k}\frac{x^{2nk}}{1-x^{2nk}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.$$
Integrating termwise and doing the evaluation at $\frac{x}{2}$ one has 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{4^k}\binom{2k}{k}\int_0^{\frac{x}{2}}\frac{t^{2nk}}{1-t^{2nk}}dt=\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)-0.$$ Step 2. For $|x|<1$, let the expression for the power $\arcsin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ that was in the literature, you can deduce from this MathWorld . Combining with the Lambert  series as I did in Step 1 , one writes $$\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)}{\binom{2k}{k}k^2}\frac{x^{2nk}}{1-x^{2nk}}=\arcsin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right).$$
We take the derivative termwise, since $\frac{d}{dx}\arcsin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}}$ and $\frac{d}{dx}\frac{x^{2nk}}{1-x^{2nk}}=\frac{2nkx^{2nk-1}}{(1-x^{2nk})^2}$, to get $$\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n\mu(n)}{\binom{2k}{k}k}\frac{x^{2nk-1}}{(1-x^{2nk})^2}=\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right).$$ Step 3. For $|x|<1$, one gets by combination of the two deduced identites in previous steps that 
$$\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n\mu(n)}{\binom{2k}{k}k}\frac{x^{2nk-1}}{(1-x^{2nk})^2}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{4^k}\binom{2k}{k}\int_0^{\frac{x}{2}}\frac{t^{2nk}}{1-t^{2nk}}dt.$$ Background for the question. I would like to verify previous identity, I say the identity of Step 3 for example for $x=\frac{1}{2}$. I know that then the definite integration from $$\int \frac{x^a}{1-x^a}dx=x({_2F_1\left(1 ,\frac{1}{a} ;1+\frac{1}{a};x^{a}\right)}-1)+\text{constant}$$ will be convergent (I've read the conditions from a MathWolrd article, and also I know the arithmetic of Pochhammer symbols). I presume that all my steps can be justified by absolute convergence for $|x|<1$. Question. Can you provide me a decimal approximation of both sides of the deduced identity in Step 3 at $x=\frac{1}{2}$ to check my calculations (I say that if these are different, then should be a mistake)? Of course if you know that there is a mistake in my calculations or reasoning, especially about the convergence, tell me please.

2076696,Poincare duality in group (co)homology,"My understanding of Poincare duality (via wikipedia ) is that for an $n$-dimensional orientable closed manifold $X$, for any coefficient ring $R$, there is an isomorphism
$$H^k(X,R)\cong H_{n-k}(X,R)$$
Here, the wiki article says that this isomorphism depends on making a ""choice of orientation with respect to the coefficient ring $R$"", which here I'm interpreting as - The isomorphism always exists, but the choice of isomorphism depends on a choice of orientation. Is this correct so far? Assuming the above is correct, then if $Z$ is a contractible orientable space, and $G$ is a group acting freely on $Z$, then $Z/G$ is the classifying space for $G$. Is it true that $H^i(Z/G,R)\cong H^i(G,R)$, and $H_i(Z/G,R)\cong H_i(G,R)$? (where $H^i(G,R),H_i(G,R)$ is group cohomology, with $R$ viewed as its underlying abelian additive group with trivial $G$-action). If things are still correct (please correct me if I'm making any mistakes!), then Poincare duality should give some nontrivial relations between group cohomology and group homology. For example, if $G$ acts freely on an orientable contractible space of dimension 2, then for any ring $R$ (identified with its underlying additive group), the central extensions of $G$ by $R$ (classified by elements of $H^2(G,R)$) should be in bijection with elements of $H_0(G,R)\cong R$ - but this is definitely false, since if $G$ has trivial Schur multiplier, one can compute that $H^2(G,R) = 0$ for any ring $R$. Where have I gone wrong? I suspect the comparison between $H_i(Z/G,R)$ and $H_i(G,R)$ and $H^i(Z/G,R)$ and $H^i(G,R)$ must be subtler than I expect. Even so, are there examples of theorems which use Poincare duality (or other properties of singular (co)homology) to produce nontrivial results in group (co)homology? Is there a good reference which discusses the comparison between group (co)homology and the singular (co)homology of classifying spaces in detail?

My idea : for each $y \in Y$ consider the line between $y$ and $\pi(y)$. Put coordinate on this line such that $ 0 = y$ and $\infty = \pi(y)$. Then, take $W$ to be the union of such lines. Define $f : W \to k$as follows : any point $x \in W$ is on some line with given coordinate, and let $f(x)$ be this coordinate. Then we can see that $\text{div}(f) = Y - \deg(\pi)\pi(Y)$. My problems are : $W$ is not really well defined since if $\pi(y) = y$ the line is not defined. Secondly I am not really convinced $f$ is a rational function, i.e how to see it is locally given by quotient of polynomial ?

2076747,Proving geometrically that stereographic projection conserves circles,"I am aware of a few analytical calculations showing that the stereographic projection sends circles on the sphere to circles on the equatorial plane. There are related questions here . What about a geometrical proof? I have found one somewhere that goes as follows. Let $O$ be the center of the sphere and $S$ the pole doing the projection. Choose a circle $C$ on the sphere lying on a plane $P$, and denote its center $A$. The rays joining $S$ to the circle $C$ cross the equatorial plane $P'$ at some points, which we want to prove form another circle. Let $M$ and $N$ be the two points on the circle $C$ such that they belong to the $SOA$ plane. Their stereographic projection on the equatorial plane are denoted by $M'$ and $N'$. The angles noted in the attached figure can easily be proven equal, leading to the two angles $SMN$ and $SN'M'$ being equal. This means that the planes $P$ and $P'$ are symmetrical to each other by reflection across the axis $SA$ (shown as an arrow). Now, the proof follows saying that the ""cone"" from $S$ to $C$ has the same symmetry, so that its intersections with the two planes $P$ and $P'$ are ""equivalent"". As a consequence, the two intersections are circles, and this proves the theorem. But wait. To me, this is not really a ""cone"". But fine, it does not need to be. However, it does not seem symmetrical across $SA$: taking the symmetric point of $N$ or $M$ will clearly not land on the same ""cone"". So that would mean that the two shapes made by intersecting with $P$ and $P'$ should not be equivalent; consequently, stereographic projection would not send circles to circles.

I was not given a differential equation, so I determined it on my own and got that they satisfy $$y'''-3y''+3y'-y = 0.$$ I found the Wronskian, $2e^{3x}\neq0$ for any real number. Thus the set is linearly independent.

2076925,Raising Complex Numbers to Complex Powers,"So I was recently introduced to Maclaurin series, which leads to the inevitable proving of $e^{i\pi} = -1$, and from that the discovery of the equation $e^{ix} = i\sin(x) + \cos(x)$. I noted that using these properties, any real number $r$ can be raised to the complex power $a+bi$ by the equation: $$r^a(i\sin(b\ln(r))+\cos(b\ln(r)))$$ I was interested in raising complex numbers to complex powers, and couldn't find anything on the internet about this. Therefore I tried to generalize the equation to accept complex values of $r$, say $c+di$. From there I got to the equation: $$(c+di)^{(a+bi)}=c^a(i\sin(b\ln(\sqrt{c^2+d^2})) + \cos(b\ln(\sqrt{c^2+d^2})))(\cosh(b\arg(c+di)) - \sinh(b\arg(c+di)))$$ Which I got from using the identities: $$\ln(a+bi) = \ln(\sqrt{a^2+b^2})+i\arg(a+bi)$$
$$\sin(a+bi) = \sin(a)\cosh(b)+i\cos(a)\sinh(b)$$
$$\cos(a+bi) = \cos(a)\cosh(b) + i\sin(a)\sinh(b)$$ From here I ran, tediously, the value $(1+i)^{1+i}$ through my formula and through Google, and they matched, which was both surprising and great. This leads to two questions: In general, does generalization of all sub-functions within a function generalize the entire function? Basically, is the approach I took to generalizing my first equation to my second equation an approach I can expect to work in general? How does this, relate, if at all, to the Wolfram Alpha equation given at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexExponentiation.html ?","['complex-numbers', 'calculus', 'proof-verification', 'complex-analysis', 'proof-writing']"

2077096,Choice of $q$ in Baby Rudin's Example 1.1,"First, my apologies if this has already been asked/answered.  I wasn't able to find this question via search. My question comes from Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" or ""Baby Rudin,"" Ch 1, Example 1.1 on p. 2.  In the second version of the proof, showing that sets A and B do not have greatest or lowest elements respectively, he presents a seemingly arbitrary assignment of a number $q$ that satisfies equations (3) and (4), plus other conditions needed to show that $q$ is the right number for the proof.  As an exercise, I tried to derive his choice of $q$ so that I may learn more about the problem. If we write equations (3) as $q = p - (p^2 - 2)x$ , we can write (4) as $$
q^2 - 2 = (p^2 - 2)[1 - 2px + (p^2 - 2)x^2].
$$ Here, we need a rational $x > 0$ , chosen such that the expression in $[...]$ is positive.  Using the quadratic formula and the sign of $(p^2 - 2)$ , it can be shown that we need $$
x \in \left(0, \frac{1}{p + \sqrt{2}}\right) \mbox{ for } p \in A,
$$ or, for $p \in B$ , $x < 1/\left(p + \sqrt{2}\right)$ or $x > 1/\left(p - \sqrt{2}\right)$ . Notice that there are MANY solutions to these equations! The easiest to see, perhaps, is letting $x = 1/(p + n)$ for $n \geq 2$ .  Notice that Rudin chooses $n = 2$ for his answer, but it checks out easily for other $n$ . The Question: Why does Rudin choose $x = 1/(p + 2)$ specifically?  Is it just to make the expressions work out clearly algebraically?  Why doesn't he comment on his particular choice or the nature of the set of solutions that will work for the proof?

2077225,The idea behind the proof of Riemann mapping theorem,"The proof of Riemann mapping theorem (if $U\subsetneq\mathbb C$ is simply connected then it's conformally equivalent to the unit disk $D$) goes roughly as follows: Consider the family $F$ of all injective functions $U\rightarrow D$ taking a given point $a$ to $0$. Show that $F$ is nonempty. The map $f\mapsto |f'(a)|$ is continuous and $F$ is uniformly bounded, so by Montel's theorem there is an $f_0\in F$ maximizing $|f_0'(a)|$. Show that $f_0$ is onto $D$. The two tricky bits of the proof are the second and fourth bullets. Here are the ideas behind the proofs of the two: We may WLOG assume $0\not\in U$. Then there is a branch $g$ of a square root defined on $U$. Then $g$ is injective, $-g(U)$ is open and disjoint from $g(U)$ so $g(U)$ is disjoint from some closed disk. The complement of that disk can be then mapped into $D$, and composing with suitable Mobius transformation maps $a$ to $0$. Suppose $b\in D\setminus f_0(U)$. Then the map
$$\psi(z)=\sqrt{\frac{f_0(z)-b}{1-\overline{b}f_0(z)}}$$
(the inside function doesn't vanish, so we can find a branch of its square root on $U$) takes $U$ into the unit disk and hence
$$h(z)=\frac{\psi(z)-\psi(a)}{1-\overline{\psi(a)}\psi(z)}$$
is in $F$. We then find
$$|h'(a)|=\frac{1+|b|}{2\sqrt{|b|}}|f_0'(a)|>|f_0'(a)|$$
contradicting the choice of $f_0$. I can see the reason behind proving the former the way we do - we want to map $U$ into a set the complement of which has nonempty interior. The square root suits this perfectly since $g(U)$ and $-g(U)$ are always disjoint for a branch of square root (we could similarly take a branch of logarithm, then $g(U)$ and $g(U)+2\pi i$ are disjoint). However, the last part of the proof feels to me like a magic trick. I thought about it several times, but I couldn't figure out anything to explain this course of action in the proof. Clearly we would like to increase a derivative somehow, but confirming this with the function constructed above requires a computational effort, not something visible at a glance. I was wondering, how to ""justify"" construction of this function in the last part of the proof (possibly by some geometric argument)? Alternatively, is it possible to argue towards existence of a function with a larger derivative, without necessarily constructing it?","['intuition', 'complex-analysis', 'complex-numbers']"

2077565,Integrating Powers of $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ using Fourier Transforms,"This is a problem from a past qualifying exam: The Fourier transform of the characteristic function $h=\chi_{[-1,1]}$ of the interval $[-1,1]$ is 
$$\hat h(\xi) =\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\sin \xi}{\xi}.$$ 
Using various properties of the Fourier transform, calculate
$$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx$$
$$\int_0^\infty \big(\frac{\sin x}{x}\big)^2dx$$
$$\int_0^\infty \big(\frac{\sin x}{x}\big)^4dx.$$ 
Note: Here we are using the definition of the Fourier transform
$$\hat f(\xi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-ix\xi} f(x) dx.$$ 
To evaluate the third integral, you may make use of the formula
$$ (h\ast h)(x) = \begin{cases}
2-|x| & \ |x|<2 \\
0 & \ |x| \geq 2
\end{cases}$$. I figured out the $\int_0^\infty \big(\frac{\sin x}{x}\big)^2dx$ portion by simply using Plancherel, i.e. $||h||_2^2 = ||\hat h||_2^2$. I am still struggling with the other cases, however. I have tried the Fourier Inversion as well as multiplication formula. Because of the hint, I would gather that in the last case you are also supposed to use the fact that $\widehat{h\ast h} = \hat h \cdot \hat h$.","['integration', 'convolution', 'fourier-transform']"

2077705,How to find limits using change of variables?,"In my country education system, in Math we don't have the right to use L'Hopital's rule to solve indeterminate forms limits for this year. Instead we use differnt techniques, such as expanding expressions and recently we used change of variable in order to compute limits for different functions that have $ln$ or $e^x$ in them . For $\ln$ we know the following limits, we don't need to prove them : $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \ln x/x = 0^+$$ $$\lim_{x\to 0}\ln (x+1)/x = 1 $$ $$\lim_{x\to0} \ln (x)x = 0^-$$ Then, whenever we have a limit with $ln$ that yield an indeterminate form we use change of variable in order to get a limit that is similar to one of these 3 limits. Example : For example we need to compute the following limit : $$\lim_{x\to-\infty} \frac{x}{\ln|x|}$$ For this one we get an indeterminate form, I need to use the change of variable to try to get a limit that is similar to one of the previous 3 limits, let : $t = -x <-> x = -t$ then we would have the following : $$\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{-t}{\ln(t)}$$ $$\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{-1}{\frac{\ln(t)}{t}} = -\infty$$ As you can see in the denominator we got the expression as the first limit expression, then I can easily solve it. The Problem : My problem, is that I'm really bad at changing variable, I can't find which one would suite the problem as I have very weak algebra skills . Here are some limits that I couldn't find a way to solve using this method : $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{\ln(x+1)}{\sqrt{x}} $$ $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\ln(x)^2}{x}$$ So How Can I solve such limits using the method I described ? How Can I Find the right way to change a variable for a given complicated limit ? Is there a way to follow?
