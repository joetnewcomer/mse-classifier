1567573,Continuous function taking each of its values twice,"I read that a continuous function can't take each of it's values exactly twice.
But I don't understand why e.g. take the function $x^2$ and add one point to it very close to $0$ that also has $0$ value (and shift the rest of the function with the difference between the $x$-coordinate of the added point and $0$), then it takes each value twice. Or is it not continuous in this case? Also could you give me a function in R that takes each of its values three times?",['real-analysis']
1567613,Showing properties of a space using dense subsets (soft),"I'm noticing a lot of times during my functional analysis course, that I'm missing some calculus basics (2 years passed since my last class covering this stuff): Especially when working with Lebesgue- and Sobolev-Spaces, one often withdraws to dense subsets of those spaces in order to prove properties of the spaces itself. I try to formulate my problem as abstract as possible: Imagine there is an abstract normed space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ and some dense subset $Y\subset X$. First of all, dense means, that I can approximate each object $x\in X$ by a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of objects in $Y$. This means that: $$x_n\overset{n\to\infty}\to x\,\text{in }\|\cdot\|\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\lim_{n\to\infty}\|x_n-x\| = 0$$ Imagine further, that we want to show a certain property for all objects $x\in X$. Often we would then just consider the approximating sequence of objects in $Y$, and for the objects in $Y$ the property is easily shown (most of the times). In an exam I would now just write down that the property - because of density - also holds in the limit. Anyway, I'd be cheating on myself If I claim understand why exactly density is enough for this. Another point that's unclear to me is, if this procedure (of saying that it has to hold in the limit because of density) is always valid in the above abstract setting, or if there is some other assumption that has to hold. Maybe there is someone who can enlighten me a bit. EDIT: A concrete example When proving the Poincaré-inequality $\|u\|_{L^p(U)}\leq C\|Du\|_{L^p(U)}$ for $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, and e.g. $u\in W^{1,p}_0(U)$, one just restricts oneself to a function $v\in C^\infty_0(U)$, for which the argument can be shown. Then I have here in my notes that after taking a series of $C^\infty_0$ functions $\varphi_n(x)$ that converge to $u$ in $W^{1,1}_0(U)$: [...] We showed the claim for every $\varphi_n$. By density it has to hold also in the limit.","['functional-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'sobolev-spaces', 'limits']"
1567637,When does the normality of the family of derivatives imply that the family itself is normal?,"Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of analytic functions in a domain $G$. Denote by $\mathcal{F}':=\{ f' \mid f \in \mathcal{F}\}$. It does not suffice to know that $\mathcal{F}'$ is normal to ensure that $\mathcal{F}$ is normal (namely take $\mathcal{F} = \{ n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ as a counterexample) but someone assured me that if you assume at some fixed point $z_0 \in G$, if you know that $f(z_0) = 0$ for all $f \in \mathcal{F}$ and that $\mathcal{F}'$ is normal, then $\mathcal{F}$ is normal. But I can't see how to do it. A friend tried something with line integrals to show that the $f$ are locally bounded on compact subsets, but he only considered compact sets that were the image of a path, which I don't think is sufficient. Which characterization of normality should I try (local boundedness? convergence in the space of functions?)? Does anyone have an idea?","['complex-analysis', 'normal-families']"

1567784,Matrix Differential equation x'(t) = Ax(t)+b solution defined for non-invertible values,"The problem I am trying to find a solution for is this linear ODE, where A is an $n x n$ matrix and b is an $nx1$ matrix. $$x'(t) = Ax(t) + b$$ One solution for this equation is provided by a wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_differential_equation#Stability_and_steady_state_of_the_matrix_system $$x^* = -A^{-1} b$$
$$x(t) = x^* + e^{At}(x(0) - x^*)$$ The biggest trouble I am running into is that, in my case, $A$ may be singular. In which case, this solution won't work. One thing I noticed: if this were a scalar problem, not a matrix problem, and A were non-invertible, than A would have to be zero. If I set A to zero in my original equation, I get the following. $$x'(t) = 0x(t) + b$$
$$x'(t) = b$$
$$x(t) = bt + x(0)$$ This tells me that the solution I seek should resolve to $x(t) = bt + x(0)$ if $A$ is the zero matrix. How can I determine the solution to this equation when $A$ is singular, but not zero?

1567792,Galois Theoretic Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,"The Galois Theory proof involves proving that $F(i)$ is algebraically closed for any real closed field $F$ (where $i$ is a square root of $-1$), where we may define a real closed field as an ordered field in which every odd degree polynomial has a root and every positive number has a square root. The last step in the proof seems a bit ad-hoc though; it involves showing that $F(i)$ has no quadratic extension, which in turn involves showing that every element of $F(i)$ has a square root, which involves solving $(a+bi)^2=c+di$ for $a, b \in F$. Is there a more Galois-theoretic approach to the last step that I'm not aware of? Or, for that matter, some other deeper reason why the computation works out? Edit Here's the proof that I have that $F(i)$ is closed under square roots, to illustrate how it's ad-hoc. I'd prefer a solution that doesn't involve explicitly solving for a square root - is there a more abstract reason why $F(i)$ should be closed under taking square roots? We can explicitly solve $(a+bi)^2=c+di$ for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$ and $d$. We have $(a+bi)^2 = a^2-b^2+2abi$, yielding the system of equations $$a^2-b^2=c$$ and $$2ab=d.$$ Since every element of $F$ already has a square root in $F(i)$, we may assume $d \neq 0$, and substitute $b = d/(2a)$ into the first equation, which gives $a^2-d^2/(4a^2) = c$, or $4a^4-4ca^2-d^2=0$. Observing that the discriminant of this quadratic is positive, we can then see that $$a^2 := \frac{4c + \sqrt{16c^2+16d^2}}{8} \in F$$ is positive, because $16c^2+16d^2>(4c)^2$ (and by $\sqrt{\bullet}$ I mean the positive square root), and therefore has two square roots in $F$. Letting $a$ be such a square root, we set $b = d/2a$ and call it a day.","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory']"

A similar parametrization in cylindrical coordinates is: $\langle \sin(\phi)^2 \cos(\theta), \sin(\phi)^2 \sin(\theta), \sin(\phi) \cos(\phi)\rangle$. At $\phi = 0$ and $\theta = 0$, which corresponds to the point $(0,0,1)$ in cartesian coordinates, the normal is $\langle 0,0,0 \rangle$ while one would expect $(0,0,1)$.","['multivariable-calculus', 'parametrization']"

1568098,bound and free variables,"I have a question that has been bothering me for quite some time. In second order logic sometimes there is an indication that a variable can be both bound and free. The simplest example I can give is using the variable $v_0$ and the constants $c_0, c_1$ who are not equal to one another. How does one interpret the following formula.
$$(v_0=c_0)\wedge \left[ \exists v_0 (v_0 = c_1)\right]$$ I see a few possible interpretations: The statement is not actually valid because variables cannot be both bound and free. The formula will always be false because $(v_0=c_0)$ restricts $v_0$ such that there cannot exist a $v_0=c_1$ The formula is true when $v_0=c_0$ because one essentially treats the free version of a variable differently from the bound version such that even though $v_0=c_0$ in this particular instance, it still theoretically could be that a variable $v_0$ equals the constant $c_1$ and thus the existence clause is satisfied as well. I also recognize that it could be something completely different from any of these that I have not thought of yet, I was just curious if there was an accepted way to handle variables which are both free and bound because I have not found any satisfying answers as of yet.","['model-theory', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Given an action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ , the stabilizer , $G_x$ , of $x$ is defined by $$ G_x = \{ g \in G : gx = x \}; $$ and the orbit , $Gx$ , of $x$ is defined by $$ Gx = \{ gx : g \in G \}. $$ Properties: (i) $Gx \subset X$ and $G_x \le G$ ; (ii) there exists a bijection from $Gx$ to the coset space $G/G_x$ ; and (iii) if $G$ is finite, then $|Gx|=|G/G_x|$ . The Statement of the Problem: Prove the following: (a) For each subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ , the action $G$ by left translation on the left coset space $G/H$ is transitive. (b) Each transitive action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is equivalent to the action $G$ by left translation on the coset space $G/G_x$ , for each $x \in X$ . (c) For subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $G$ , the left translation actions of $G$ on $G/H$ and $G/K$ are equivalent if and only if $H$ and $K$ are conjugate. Where I Am: For part (a): The action of $G$ by left translation on the left coset space $G/H$ has only one orbit and is, thus, transitive. (i.e., since $gH=g \cdot H$ , the orbit of $H \in G/H$ is the whole coset space.) [I pretty much understand this. It was mostly the result of piecing together definitions and properties, but doesn't make too much intuitive sense to me.] For part (b): Since $Gx \subset X$ and we are considering transitive actions of $G$ on $X$ (i.e., actions with only one orbit), in this case, $Gx = X$ [I'm not actually sure if this is true, but it seems correct. I would like to be able to prove it, but can't seem to figure out how]. We know that there exists a bijection $f: Gx \to G/G_x$ , so it must also be the case that $f$ maps from $X$ to $G/G_x$ bijectively. [Here, I need to prove that the action of $G$ on $f$ fixes $f$ , which I can't figure out how to do.] Since the action of $G$ on $f$ fixes $f$ , we have that $X \sim G/G_x$ , as desired. For part (c): I have made the least amount of progress on this one. To show that $H$ and $K$ are conjugate, I assume that I need to show that $K = gHg^{-1}$ , for some $g \in G$ , and $H = gKg^{-1}$ , for some $g \in G$ . I can see how this'd be the case if these subgroups were normal in $G$ , but I can't seem to get it from the assumptions given. Obviously, this statement is biconditional, so I have to prove the other direction, as well; but I'd be happy to get at least One Direction $^{\text{TM}}$ .","['group-actions', 'abstract-algebra', 'equivalence-relations', 'group-theory']"

I am thinking the answer is yes but i'm not sure how to show it. My question in some sense reduces to whether given a group $G$ with operation $f(a,b) = ab$ if we define another operation $g(a,b) = ba$ is $G$ under the new operations the same group? Something to observe is that if two elements are inverses in one then they are inverses here as well.  Furthermore for any expression $a_1^{k_1} a_2^{k_2} ... a_r^{k_r}= M$ in the original group there is a unique expression of the form $a_r^{k_r} a_{r-1}^{k_{r-1}} ... a_1^{k_1}$ in the new group.

1568548,Where has this common generalization of nets and filters been written down?,"It is well-known that there are two different ways to generalize the theory of convergence of sequences to arbitrary topological spaces: nets and filters.  They are of course essentially equivalent, but each has its own minor advantages for pedagogy and intuition.  Seemingly less well-known is the following common generalization of both nets and filters: Let $X$ be a topological space.  Then a filternet (this is a term I made up) in $X$ consists of a set $I$, a filter $F$ on $I$, and a map $I\to X$ (written $i\mapsto x_i$).  We say $(x_i)$ converges to a point $x\in X$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, $\{i\in I:x_i\in U\}\in F$. If $I$ is a directed set, then we can take $F$ to be the ""eventual"" filter on $I$, and then $(x_i)$ converges to $x$ as a filternet iff it converges to $x$ as a net.  On the other hand, if $F$ is a filter on $X$, we can take $I=X$ and $x_i=i$ for all $i$, and $(x_i)$ converges to $x$ iff the filter $F$ converges to $x$.  So filternets include both filters and nets as special cases.  Like filters and nets, filternets can be used to describe basic topological notions (closed sets, continuity, compactness, etc.) in terms of convergence.  Pedagogically, filternets have some of the advantages of both filters and nets: like nets, they are intuitively similar to sequences (they have an index set, and it is obvious how to push them forward along maps), and like with filters, the theory of ""subfilternets"" and ""ultrafilternets"" is very simple and does not require you to change the index set. While nets and filters are both quite well-represented in the literature, filternets are not so common.  The main way I have seen them used is in talking about limits of sequences with respect to an ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$, usually in the context of talking about ultraproducts of metric spaces and related ideas (see this Wikipedia page , for instance).  But this is still rather different from thinking of them as providing a general theory of convergence like nets and filters, and in fact I have never seen filternets used in this general way in any published work (I learned about them as a general theory of convergence from Nik Weaver, who just called them ""nets"", in my undergraduate pointset topology class).  So, my question is: Where have ""filternets"" been written about (as a general theory of convergence on topological spaces)?  Is there a standard name for them?  Who first invented them?  Is there some kind of standard reference that covers them (e.g., a pointset topology textbook that uses them, or some well-known expository paper that discusses them alongside filters and nets)?","['reference-request', 'nets', 'filters', 'general-topology', 'convergence-divergence']"

Since $X$ is nonempty, it has nonempty interior, and since $X = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}E_{n}$ , by a previous result, at least one of the $E_{n}$ 's, say $E_{n_{0}}$ has nonempty interior; i.e., for $x_{0} \in E_{n_{0}}$ , $\exists r>0$ such that $B_{0}(x_{0},r)\subset E_{n_{0}}=\overline{E_{n_{0}}}$ . From here, I have no idea where to go in order to get the uniform boundedness. Please help. I am completely and utterly clueless as to how to proceed.","['general-topology', 'complete-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

Please feel free to comment on this, if you'd like. The Jordan form was the key point of the problem, for anyone interested in solving the below problem. This is an old exam question from linear algebra that I am working on, The problem statement is: Part 1 Can you find $2×2$ matrices $A$,$B$, and $C$, so that $A^2≠0$, $B^2≠0$ and $C^2≠0$ but $AB=0$,$BC=0$ and $CA=0$?

1569381,Correct definition of gradient (and divergence) on smooth manifolds (for engineers),"I am very sorry if this is a very trivial question or my formulation is inadequate, I am only an engineer, and I am not familiar with the topic. I am looking for the definition of the gradient of a function $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ being on a $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold $M = \{x | m(x) = 0\}$ defined through a real valued and differentiable scalar function $m(x) = 0 \in \mathbb{R}^1$. The vector $f(x)$ is not necessarily tangent to $M$. After some reading I found the definition of an ""intrinsic gradient"" of a function $f(x)$ on $M$ through orthogonal projection
\begin{equation}
\nabla_M f(x) = J - \left(\frac{J\mu}{||\mu||^2}\right) \otimes \mu
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
J = \nabla_x f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\ , \quad
\mu = \nabla_x m(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}
\end{equation}
and $\otimes$ being the dyadic product. Is this $\nabla_M f(x)$ the quantity which tells me how $f(x)$ from point to point on the manifold changes? I can interpret this more or less by the perspective that the total change of $f(x)$ at $x$ is described by its normal gradient, but the change relevant to the points on the manifold is described by the part of the gradient tangential to the manifold. So the orthogonal projection filters the relevant part. Question: Is this interpretation and definition correct? If not, could you recommend any literature for starting with this topic? Actually, I have to understand the gradients (and divergence, for which I am also not sure of its definition) of functions defined on the manifold of rotational matrices $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} $ in 3D, $M = \{Q | QQ^T=1_3 \wedge \det(Q)=1 \}$ with $1_3$ being the identity matrix in 3D. But before that I need to be sure that I understand first the easy stuff. Thanks! EDIT 1: I just thought a little more and I dont know if the following definition of the divergence on a manifold is sensible and already defined. For $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ I know that the divergence is defined as
\begin{equation}
{\rm div}{(f(x))} 
= (\nabla_x f(x)) \cdot 1_n 
= \sum_{\alpha=1}^n \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial x_\alpha}
= \sum_{\alpha=1}^n (\nabla_x f(x))\cdot(e_\alpha \otimes e_\alpha)
\end{equation}
with arbitrary orthonormal basis vectors $\{e_\alpha\}$. For a manifold $M = \{x|m(x)=0\}$ the matrix
\begin{equation}
1_M = 1_n - \frac{\mu}{||\mu||}\otimes\frac{\mu}{||\mu||} , \quad
\mu = \nabla_x m(x)
\end{equation}
represents the sum of the dyadic products of $(n-1)$ orthonormal tangential vectors $\tau_\alpha$ of the $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold at $x$, so
\begin{equation}
{\rm div}_M(f(x)) 
= (\nabla_M f(x)) \cdot 1_M
= \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n-1} (\nabla_M f(x)) \cdot (\tau_\alpha\otimes\tau_\alpha)
\end{equation} 
would give me the sum of the relevant changes of $f(x)$ in the different orthonormal tangential directions at $x$ on the manifold. This definition turns out (after some calculations) to be 
\begin{equation}
{\rm div}_M(f(x)) 
= (\nabla_M f(x)) \cdot 1_M
= {\rm div}(f(x)) - \frac{\mu}{||\mu||} \cdot \left( (\nabla_x f(x)) \frac{\mu}{||\mu||} \right)
\end{equation} Is this the correct definition of the divergence on a manifold? This idea is for me geometrically intuitive but from a physical point of view I don't like it since singular points (wells and sinks) on the manifold for which the original divergence vanishes may not be identified as singular points on the manifold.

I am starting to think that $\sqsubset$ and $\sqsubseteq$ are equivalent to $\subset$ and $\subseteq$. However, sometimes there are subtle differences, so I want to be certain about this. I want to be sure that I understand the intended meaning when reading future papers, to avoid any misunderstandings. Thanks in advance.","['notation', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1569406,When does a Markov chain not have a steady state?,"I was asked this question on an oral qual, and eventually I seemed to conclude that there have to be eigenvalues of modulus 1.

1569422,Continuous functions and uncountable intersections with the x-axis,"Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the set $X = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) = 0\}$ does not contain any interval (i.e. there is no interval $I \subset X$) Of course the set $X$ can be uncountable (see Cantor Set ). If we add that $f$ is continuous, is it true that X is countable? I have been thinking about this for a while, and couldn't find any counterexamples - my intuition says the answer is yes. I tried to start a proof but really couldn't move forward. My attempt (by contradiction): assume $X$ is uncountable. Then there exists $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $X \cap [a, b]$ is uncountable. Now, let $g$ be the restriction of $f$ to $[a, b]$. Then $g$ is uniformly continuous. I don't know what to do next, though... Any hints appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'examples-counterexamples', 'cantor-set']"

1569472,On the meaning of the complex measure $\int_{\mathbb{C}} d z d \bar{z}$,"I have a problem to understand the meaning of a complex measure; i.e., when someone writes ($i \equiv \sqrt{-1}$)
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} d\mathrm{Re}z \, d\mathrm{Im}z  \equiv \int_{\mathbb{C}} \frac{dz d\bar{z}}{2i} \quad (\ast)
$$
The lefthand-side will yield a real number (after performing the integration over a real-valued function), while it is not obvious that the righthand-side yields a real number. Furthermore, how can one obtain the equivalence relation? Is the factor $\frac{1}{2i}$ the Jacobian of some transformation like
$$
z = \mathrm{Re} z + i \, \mathrm{Im} z ,\\
\bar{z} = \mathrm{Re} z - i \, \mathrm{Im} z ,\\
$$
So, the complex measure $dz d\bar{z}$ does not have the same meaning as a ‘simple’ complex integration which in complex calculus (integration over a path in the complex plane). Please provide an explanation for the complex measure and the equivalence relation ($\ast$) above. Notes 1. A similar question is asked here ; yet no clear proof or justification is provided. 2.
