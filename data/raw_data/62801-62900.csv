716332,Projection operator in Hilbert space,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, can we find an increasing net of finite rank projections which converge to the identity in the strong operator topology? And I think if $H$ is separable, we can find an orthonormal basis $\{v_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and let $p_{n}$ be the projection (from $H$) onto span$\{v_{1}, ..., v_{n}\}$. Then, we can verify $||p_{n}x-x||\rightarrow 0$ for all $x\in H$.

716461,Proof Verification - Every sequence in $\Bbb R$ contains a monotone sub-sequence,"Came across the following exercise in Bartle 's Elements of Real Analysis . This is the solution I came up with. Would be grateful if someone could verify it for me and maybe suggest better/alternate solutions. I also looked up these related questions - (1) , (2) , (3) - but was not happy with proofs given there. I seem to need some help understanding these. Any such help is appreciated. Show that every sequence in $\Bbb R$ either has a monotone increasing sub-sequence or a monotone decreasing sub-sequence. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $\Bbb R$. Suppose $(x_n)$ is not bounded. Without loss of generality we may assume that $(x_n)$ is not bounded above. Therefore given any real number there is a member of the sequence which is greater. Let $x_{n_1}$ be any member of the sequence. There is $x_{n_2} \gt \sup\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n_1} \}$. For $i \gt 1$ let $x_{n_i} = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n_{i - 1}}\}$ then $(x_{n_k})$ forms a monotone subsequence of $(x_n)$. Now suppose instead that $(x_n)$ is bounded. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem there is a subsequence $(y_n)$ of $(x_n)$ which converges to a limit $y$. Without loss of generality there are infinitely many distinct values in $(y_n)$ that are unequal to $y$. Let $y_{k1}$ be the first such element. Let $y_{k2}$ be any element in $\{ y' \in (y_n) \ \ | \ \ |y' - y | \lt |y - y_{k1}|  \}$. For $i \gt 1$ let $y_{ki} \in \{ y' \in (y_n)  \ \ | \ \ |y' - y | \lt |y - y_{k \ i - 1}|  \}$. Such $y_{ki}$ exists for every $i \in  \Bbb N$ since $ \lim (y_n) = y $. Now let $(y_{kn})$ be the sub-sequence of $(y_n)$ thus formed. At least one of the two following sets must contain infinitely many elements. $\{ y \in (y_{kn}) \ \ | \ \ y \gt x\}$ $\{ y \in (y_{kn}) \ \ | \ \ y \lt x\}$ The one which does forms a monotone subsequence.","['self-learning', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

716469,Maximum board position in 2048 game,"A game called 2048 is making rounds on social media. I am trying to determine the maximum score attainable for this game.  Let's assume WLOG that only 2s are returned (if 4s are possible the max score is doubled). First, I'll relax some of the rules to create a game, $\mathcal{G}$, that can achieve a score at least as high as the original, 2048 game.  A run $R$  of $\mathcal{G}_n$ consists of a sequence of moves $m_1,\ldots,m_k$ which manipulate a multiset, $\mathcal{S}$ of maximum size n.  Each $m_i$ is either: a put $p$, which inserts a 2 into $\mathcal{S}$, or a merge, $\alpha_i$, which replaces two $2^i$ elements from $\mathcal{S}$ with a single $2^{i+1}$ elt. I allow sequential moves of the same type because 2048 allows multiple merges or no-merge turns.  The score of a position is the sum of $\mathcal{S}$. What is the maximum score possible on a game of order n? Note: The final position must have only unique values, else a merge and put would be possible in increase score. I claim it is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^i$, but couldn't come up with any good induction arguments.  It's pretty easy to prove that an element $2^k$ is producible in a game $\mathcal{G}_k$, but proving an upper bound for production got a bit hairy, and also doesn't cover the full space.","['puzzle', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"
716489,"What are the subfields of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt[7]{5})$?","I'm trying to find the subfields of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt[7]{5})$. This is easily seen to be a degree $14$ extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. I found that there is a unique subfield of degree $2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. If $E$ and $F$ are distinct subfields of degree $2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, then 
$$
[FE:\mathbb{Q}]=[FE:E][E:\mathbb{Q}]\leq[F:\mathbb{Q}][E:\mathbb{Q}]=4.
$$
In particular, $[FE:E]\leq 2$. Since $FE\neq E$, I must get $[FE:E]=2$. But then this implies $[FE:\mathbb{Q}]=4$, a contradiction since $4\nmid 14$. So there is at most one subfield of degree $2$over $\mathbb{Q}$, and it is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. The only part left is to find the subfields of degree $7$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Certainly $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[7]{5})$ is one, but I'm having trouble finding if there are others. I know the Galois closure of is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt[7]{5},\zeta_7)$, as this is a splitting field of the separable polynomial $(X^2-3)(X^7-5)$. Then the subfields will be the fixed fields of the subgroups in the Galois group containing the subgroup fixing $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt[7]{5})$, but this seems computationally difficult. Is there a way to do it without having to look at the Galois group?","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

Now the points P = (1,2) and Q = (4,5) are on both E and $\widetilde{E}$ and $\widetilde{E}$ was found by uplifting E (from mod 7 to Q). Also it was discovered that 2(1,2) = (1,-2) and 3(1,2) = $\infty $ mod 73 on $\widetilde{E}$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'abstract-algebra']"
716557,"Defining the Lebesgue integral, and what is integrability?","EDIT : TL;DR version - What is the role of the ""measurable function"" predicate in the definition of Lebesgue integrability? If the integrals of the positive and negative pieces are finite, that should be enough, right? So I'm working on a definition of the Lebesgue integral for Metamath , and I'd like some feedback on the correctness of these definitions. Most books/articles separate these definitions by pages of text and go back and amend their definitions as they go, which is not something I can do, so I just want to make sure that I am understanding everything correctly. $$\begin{align}\lambda^*:A\in{\cal P}(\Bbb R)\mapsto \inf\Big\{&\sum_{n\in\Bbb N}(f_2(n)-f_1(n))\,\Big|\ f:\Bbb N\to\Bbb R\times\Bbb R:\\
&\big(\forall n\in\Bbb N\ f_1(n)<f_2(n)\ \wedge\ A\subset\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}(f_1(n),f_2(n))\big)\Big\}
\end{align}$$ $$\lambda=\lambda^*\restriction \{A\subseteq\Bbb R\ |\ \forall B\subseteq\Bbb R\,(\lambda^*(B)\in\Bbb R\to\lambda^*(B)=\lambda^*(B\cap A)+\lambda^*(B\setminus A))\}$$ $$\alpha_0=\{\langle {\Bbb R}\times\{0\},0\rangle\}$$
$$\alpha_{n+1}=\{\langle g+x\,{\bf 1}_A,\alpha_n(g)+x\lambda(A)\rangle\mid g\in{\rm dom}\ \alpha_n,x\in\Bbb R^+,A\in{\rm dom}\ \lambda\}$$
$${\textstyle\int_1}=\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N_0}\alpha_n$$ $${\textstyle\int_2}:(f:\Bbb R\to[0,\infty])\mapsto\sup\{{\textstyle\int_1}(g)\mid g\in{\rm dom}\ {\textstyle\int_1}:\forall x\in\Bbb R\ g(x)\le f(x)\}$$ $$\int_Af(x)\,dx=\sum_{k=0}^3i^k{\textstyle\int_2}\big(x\in\Bbb R\mapsto\max(\Re\big[f(x)i^{-k}\big],0)\cdot{\bf 1}_A(x)\big)$$ With a few light modifications for readability, that's exactly what my definition is going to be. In words: $\lambda^*$ is the Lebesgue outer measure, which is the infimum of the total length of all countable collections of intervals that cover $A$. Technical points: the collection uses open intervals, and they are required to be nonempty. Also, by ""countable"" I mean ""denumerable"" (no finite collections allowed). Thus, for example, $0$ is never in that set. But since it is an infimum, this is probably not an issue. Note that the infinite sum may possibly be $+\infty$; this is handled correctly (it is really the supremum of the partial sums over the extended reals, although I didn't write that above). $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure, which is just the outer measure restricted to those sets which split any other set into disjoint pieces that add up to the whole. Technical points: we can only do this for those sets whose outer measure is finite, or else the addition is undefined (addition is not defined on the extended reals). I think this should still give the same result as if the quantifier ranged over all sets (which is the usual way of stating this). We write ""$A$ is measurable"" as ""$A\in{\rm dom}\ \lambda$"". The $\alpha$ functions are a recursive definition of the Lebesgue integral over simple functions. All the $\alpha$ functions, as well as $\int_1$ and $\int_2$, are ""integration"" functions: they map functions (with domain $\Bbb R$ and range $\Bbb [0,\infty]$) to real numbers. I had to write out the $\alpha$ functions explicitly as sets of ordered pairs here. $\alpha_0$ has a singleton domain (the zero function) and maps it to zero; $\alpha_{n+1}$ is the collection of all function-value pairs formed by taking a function $g$ from $\alpha_n$, a positive real coefficient $x$, and a measurable set $A$, and forming the new function $z\in\Bbb R\mapsto g(z)+{\rm if}(z\in A,x,0)$ and giving it the value $\alpha_n(g)+x\lambda(A)$. Since the coefficient is strictly positive, the only time $\alpha_{n+1}$ and $\alpha_n$ use the same function is when the set $A$ is empty, in which case $\lambda(A)=0$ and the functions agree. Thus the $\alpha$ functions are compatible and their union $\int_1$ is the desired simple function integrator. $\int_2$ is an integrator over nonnegative extended real functions; it is the supremum of all simple functions less than it. Technical note: this can be $+\infty$ if the function is bounded away from zero or takes the value $+\infty$ (which is allowed) on a set of positive measure. The final full integral (written in the usual notation) is just the sum of $\int_2$ evaluated at the positive and negative real and imaginary pieces of the function, and with a region limiter tacked on for convenience. Comments about this setup are welcome. But I also have a question: nowhere above was the concept of integrability mentioned. Obviously there will be an issue if any of the four $\int_2$ integrals evaluates to $\infty$ (recall that addition is not defined for $\pm\infty$), but other than that in what ways can this definition be misused? In particular, I see no reason for the concept of a ""measurable function"" to be needed; all of the expressions are perfectly well-defined for a non-measurable function, unless I am missing something. Is there some ""basic property"" that is absolutely essential that only works for measurable functions? And if you have a measurable function and all four integrals are finite, are we clear to call the function ""(Lebesgue) integrable""?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis']"

What is the probability that the embedding will be a plane graph? [ Edit: when I say embedding , I mean an embedding of the vertices as points and embedding of the edges as straight line segments connecting their vertices; I am not sure this was clear] Is the result different when we take the unit circle instead, or if we embed it in $\mathbb{R}^2$ using Gaussian distribution? Update An equivalent question would be that: given a random triangle, what is the probability that a random selected point will lie in it. For the uniform distribution on the unit square, that had been asked already here and answered here . I have not verified the solution presented there, but if it is correct, the probability of the random embedding of $K_4$ in the unit square is $\frac{11}{144}$. This does not solve the unit circle case or the Gaussian case, however, and I am not convinced this should be similar at all.","['geometry', 'graph-theory', 'probability', 'geometric-probability']"

Here is the question to simplify: $$\frac{d}{dx}\int_{x^2}^1\frac{t^4 + 1}{t^2 + 1}dt$$ if $u = x^2$, then $\frac{du}{dx} = 2x$, which means $dx = \frac{du}{2x}$ So we have, $$-\frac{d}{\frac{du}{2x}}\int_1^u\frac{t^4 + 1}{t^2 + 1}dt$$ And then when I simplify it, $$-\frac{d}{du}\int_1^u\frac{t^4 + 1}{t^2 + 1}*(2x)dt$$ But this still doesn't get rid of the t's.

716602,"How to show existence and uniqueness of an $f: R(\omega) \to \omega$, where $R(\omega)$ is the cumulative hierarchy?","My questions For part A (see below), is my reasoning correct? Is it enough to just show that $f(x) \in \omega \ \ \forall x \in R(\omega)$? I'm very new to axiomatic set theory, in particular to the cumulative hierarchy, and I don't feel I have a good grasp of it at all yet. For part B, I don't even understand what $g(n,m)$ means. It looks like $g:\omega \to \omega$ is a function of two variables, which doesn't make sense. Could anyone elucidate? Thanks in advance! The problem - Part A - Show that there is one, and only one, function $f: R(\omega) \to \omega$ satisfying
$$f(x) = \sum_{y\in x} 2^{f(y)}$$
for each $x \in R(\omega)$. Here $R(\omega)$ is the first infinite level in the cumulative
hierarchy. Show that this function is a bijection. - Part B - Find a function $g : \omega \to \omega$ such that for all $n$ and $m$ in $\omega$ and for $x$ and $y$ in $R(\omega)$ with $n = f(x)$ and $m = f(y)$ we have that $$f(\langle x, y\rangle) = g(n,m).$$ My attempt at a solution Existence of function By induction: We have $f(0) = 0 \in \omega$. Assume $f(x) \in \omega \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Now $x' \subset R(\alpha)$ so for any $y \in x'$ we would have $f(y) \in \omega$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} \in \omega$. Uniqueness Also by induction: Assume $f, g$ both satisfy the criterion. We have $f(0) = 0 = g(0)$. Assume $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\alpha)$, and let $x' \in R(\alpha + 1)$. Again we would have $x' \subset R(\alpha)$, and thus $f(x') = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{f(y)} = \sum_{y\in x'} 2^{g(y)} = g(x')$, so $f(x) = g(x) \ \ \forall x \in R(\omega)$. Prove $f$ is a bijection Given an $\alpha \in \omega$, we can write it as $\alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, $m_1 < \dots < m_k$, where $m_i \in \omega \ \ \forall i$. We then have that $x = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} \subset R(m_k + 1)$ which means that $x \in R(m_k+2)$. Thus we have found $x \in R(\omega)$ s.t. $f(x) = \alpha$, and $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = \alpha = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k}$, then we must have $$f(x_1) = \sum_{y\in x_1} 2^{f(y)} = 2^{m_1} + \dots + 2^{m_k} = \sum_{y\in x_2} 2^{f(y)} = f(x_2),$$ and we must have $x_1 = \{m_1, \dots , m_k\} = x_2$, so $f$ is injective.

716783,Question about Feller's book on the Central Limit Theorem,"My question concerns the proof of Theorem 1, section VIII.4, in Vol II of Feller's book 'An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications'. Theorem 1 proves the Central Limit Theorem in the i.i.d. zero mean, unit variance case. In purely analytical terms, this theorem says that if $F$ is a (probability) distribution function with zero expectation and unit variance, then $$F^{n*}(x\sqrt{n}) \rightarrow \mathfrak{N}(x)$$ in the distributional sense (where $\mathfrak{N}$ is the standard normal distribution, and $(\cdot)^{n*}$ denotes the n-fold convolution operation). To prove this, Feller uses the following (the proof of which I understand): $\textbf{Lemma}$ $\quad$ Denote by $\mathfrak{F}_n$ the convolution operator associated with the functions $F_n(x):= F(x\sqrt{n})$. Then for any $u : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with three bounded derivatives and finite limits at $\pm \infty$, we have the following uniform convergence on the line: $$n[\mathfrak{F}_nu - u] \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}u''. \quad \square $$ Now denote by $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}_n$ resoectively the convolution operators associated with the distributions  $\mathfrak{N}(x)$ and  $\mathfrak{N}(x\sqrt{n})$. Then it is easy to derive the following inequality, where the norm is the supremum norm: $$  \|\mathfrak{F}_n^n(u) - \mathfrak{G}(u) \| \leq n\|\mathfrak{F}_n(u) - u \| + n\|\mathfrak{G}_n(u)-u \| .$$ Now comes the bit I don't understand. He claims that, by the Lemma above, the RHS of this inequality tends to zero. (N.B. He doesn't specify what kind of function $u$ is). How can this be so, unless $u''=0$ on the line? This suggests to me that he is approximating all continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$ with finite limits at $\pm \infty$ by functions with zero second derivative. I guess this can be done? And do you think this is what Feller is doing at this stage? Many thanks for your help. Frank.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

I am not an expert in normalizations, and the only examples I saw were from one-dimensional rings (normalization of curves). I would really appreciate if someone could explain how one can attack such a problem, and guide me to a solution. Just to let you know why I find this problem difficult, I will include roughly my attempts. So, I look at the equation $t^3=x^3y$ of the surface and I see that what essentially is missing in $A$ is a third root of $y$. This suggests to make a ""change of coordinates $\mathbb C[x,y,t]\to \mathbb C[u,v,z]$, where now we send $y\mapsto u^3$, say. In the (still ghost) normalization this third root will have the form $(\textrm{image of }t)/(\textrm{image of }x)$, so if I send $x\mapsto v$, I should then send $t\mapsto uv$. 
Well, but I completely ignored $z$ and this sounds like a problem doesn't it?
Also, the function $t^3-x^3y$ gets sent to $(uv)^3-v^3u^3=0$, which is silly because what I was planning in order to get $\tilde A$ was to divide out $\mathbb C[u,v,z]$ by the image of $t^3-x^3y$.

More exactly, I started reading Categories for the Working Mathematician by Saunders MacLane. I now feel comfortable with all the concepts discussed in the first five Chapters, i.e. categories and functors and the usual formulations of universal properties. I would really like to go on reading about algebra, but once I understood the strucutrual approaches to Mathematics, I can hardly imagine to continue doing all the awful calculations, basic Algebra books like Lang's are filled with, instead of using universal properties and so on. So basically, my question is, if there are books on Algebra, not assuming any algebraic knowledge, but extensively using category-theoretic methods. Of course, it is very non-standard to cover all the basic category theory before turning to applications in Algebra, but I hope someone knows a book or some lecture notes satisfying my needs. Furthermore, I would like to learn some topology. In this field I have even less knowledge than in Algebra, i.e. I don't even know the definition of a topological space.

717019,"The Best Strategy and Highest Possible Score for the ""Threes!"" Game.","[There's still the strategy to go. A suitably robust argument that establishes what is statistically the best strategy will be accepted.] Here's my description of the game: There's a $4\times 4$ grid with some random, numbered cards on. The numbers are either one, two, or multiples of three. Using up, down, left, and right moves, you add the numbers on adjacent cards to make a new card like so: $$\begin{align}\color{blue}1+\color{red}2&=3\tag{1} \\ n+n&=2n\end{align}$$ for $n=2^k3\ge 3$ , where $k\in\{0, 1, . . . , 10\}$ , so the highest a card can be is $2^{11}3$ . But at each move the ""free"" cards move too and a random new card appears at a random point along the edge you slide away from. Everything is kept on the grid. The card for the next move is indicated by colour at the top of the screen: blue for $1$ , red for $2$ , and white for $n\ge 3$ (such that $n$ is attainable using the above process). The white $2^\ell 3$ -numbered cards are worth $3^{\ell+1}$ points; the rest give no points . Once there are no more available moves, the points on the remaining cards are summed to give your score for the game. Here's another description I've found; it's the least promotional. It has the following gif. So: What's the best strategy for the game? What's the highest possible score? Thoughts: We could model this using some operations on $4\times 4$ matrices over $\mathbb{N}$ . A new card would be the addition of $\alpha E_{ij}$ for some appropriate $\alpha$ and standard basis vector $E_{ij}$ . That's all I've got . . . NB: If this is a version of some other game, please let me know so I can avoid giving undue attention to this version :) The number on each card can be written $n=2^k3^{\varepsilon_k}$ , where $$\varepsilon_k=\cases{\color{blue}0\text{ or }1 &: $k=0$ \\
\color{red}0\text{ or }1 &: $k=1$ \\
1 &: $k\ge 2$;}$$ that is, $\varepsilon_k=\cases{0 &:$n<3$ \\ 1 &:$n\ge 3$}$ . So we can write $(k, \varepsilon_k)$ instead under $$(k, \varepsilon_k)+(\ell, \varepsilon_\ell)\stackrel{(1)}{=}\cases{(k+1, 1)&: $\varepsilon_k, \varepsilon_\ell, k=\ell > 0$ \\
(0, 1)&: $\color{blue}k=\color{blue}{\varepsilon_k}=\color{red}{\varepsilon_\ell}=0, \color{red}\ell=1$ \\
(0, 1)&: $\color{blue}\ell=\color{red}{\varepsilon_k}=\color{blue}{\varepsilon_\ell}=0, \color{red}k=1$.}$$ Looking at a $2\times 2$ version might help: the moves from different starting positions show up if we work systematically. It fills up quickly. It'd help to be more precise about what a good strategy might look like. The best strategy might be one that, from an arbitrary $4\times 4$ grid $G_0$ and with the least number of moves, gives the highest score attainable with $G_0$ , subject to the random nature of the game.

Now the condition concerning values of $f(0), f'(0)$ (and the fact that range of $f$ is subset of $[-1, 1]$) implies that $f'(0) \neq 0$ so that function is not a constant. If we take $g(x) = \{f(x)\}^{2} + \{f'(x)\}^{2}$ then we can see that $g' = 2f'(f + f'')$. One hope of solving the problem is to show that $g$ attains local extrema at some point different from an extrema of $f$. This would ensure that $g'$ vanishes without making $f'$ vanish and that will lead to $f + f'' = 0$. However the constraint on $f(0), f'(0)$ does not help in analyzing the extrema of $f$ or $g$. Another line of thought which could be helpful here is to consider $F(x) = f'(x)\sin x - f(x)\cos x$ so that $F'(x) = \sin x\{f(x) + f''(x)\}$ but in this case I am not able to see how to use the condition on values $f(0), f'(0)$ to impose some constraint on $F(x)$.

The way that $\mathcal E$ is defined, it seems that $\mathcal{RE} = 1_{{_R\text{Mod}}}$ (object-wise this is fine, though I haven't checked what happens to Hom-sets, so maybe this is wrong?). However, it seems very unlikely that the other direction ($\mathcal{ER} = 1_{{_S\text{Mod}}}$) should hold, since otherwise this would define an isomorphism of categories. Also, if anyone has an example of the above situation succeeding or failing (especially failing) that would be great; that is, I would really love to see an example of an $S$-module $M$ wherein restricting to a subring $R$ and then extending by scalars gives a different $S$-module.","['modules', 'tensor-products', 'abstract-algebra']"

My question is whether a kind of converse is true: Does every finite nilpotent group occur (up to isomorphism, of course) as the Frattini subgroup of some finite group? The problem reduces immediately to the case of non-abelian groups of prime power order, since the Frattini subgroup of a direct product of finite groups is the direct product of the Frattini subgroups of the factors, and it is not hard to show that any finite abelian group is the Frattini subgroup of a finite (abelian) group.

718027,Evaluate $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{2^n}$,This is a homework question; I'm supposed to use power series to find the following sum: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{2^n}$$ I took the geometric series $$\frac{1}{1-x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n}$$ and differentiated and multiplied both sides by x to get $$\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty {nx^n}$$ I'm stuck because I'm not sure how to make the $$\frac{1}{2^n}$$ term appear.,['sequences-and-series']
718106,Show that $f$ is constant on each sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ centered at the origin,"Hi everyone this is a past exam question that I am studying as I go through my class that I am having trouble with, the full question is this: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function and suppose that $$ \nabla f(\textbf{x}) = g(\textbf{x})\textbf{x} $$ for all $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ where $g: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  is a function. Show that $f$ is constant on each sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ centered at $(0,0,0)$. i.e. show that if $\textbf{a}$, $\textbf{b}$ $\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\|\textbf{a}\| = \|\textbf{b}\|$ then $f(\textbf{a}) = f(\textbf{b})$. I'm stuck on this question and not sure which direction to take. I'm really just throwing ideas around. I do know that the gradient vector at $\textbf{a}$ is perpendicular to all the tangent lines to the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ at $\textbf{a}$. Then letting $\textbf{x} = h(t) = (h_{1}(t), h_{2}(t), h_{3}(t))$ with $h(0)= \textbf{a}$. I have $f(h(\textbf{0}))=c$. Then taking derivatives: $$\frac{d}{dt}f(h(\textbf{0})) = \frac{d}{dt} c = 0$$ $$h'(0) \cdot \bigtriangledown f(h(\textbf{0})) = 0$$ Substituting in for $f(h(\textbf{0}))$ yields $$h'(0) \cdot g(\textbf{a})\textbf{a} = 0$$ Now i'm really not sure where to go from here, how relate the magnitude of $\textbf{a}$ or $\textbf{b}$ to the question (do i need to parametrise?) I would really appreciate some guidance with this question.",['multivariable-calculus']
718110,Flatness of a manifold (or a connection),"Suppose we have an $n$-dimensional manifold $S$ (with a global coordinate system) with a metric $g$ and a connection $\nabla$ with connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols) $\Gamma_{i,j}^k$ given. Suppose that the $\nabla$-geodesic connecting any two points of the manifold completely lies in $S$. Can we then say that $S$ must be flat with respect to the given connection? I am not able to straightaway show that $(\Gamma_{i,j}^k)_p = 0$ at all points $p$ of $S$.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
718137,Closure of compact sets in Banach space,"Let $(X,\vert\vert\cdot\vert\vert)$ be a Banach space. For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$ let $A_k\subseteq X$ be compact and $r_k\in\mathbb{R},r_k>0$, such that
$$A_{k+1}\subseteq \{x+u\vert x\in A_k \text{ and } u\in X \text{ with } \vert\vert u\vert\vert\leq   r_k\}$$

$$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}r_k<\infty$$
Show that the closure of $\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}A_k$ is compact. I just don't know where to start, any idea or tip would be helpful, thanks!","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'general-topology', 'analysis', 'compactness']"
