46297,Which manifolds are parallelizable?,"Recall that a manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ is parallelizable if there are $n$ vector fields that form a basis of the tangent space $T_x M$ at every point $x \in M$. This is equivalent to the tangent bundle $TM$ being trivial or the frame bundle $FM$ having a global section. I know of some conditions (both necessary and sufficient), as well as counter-examples, both of which I provided in an answer to this recent question on tangent bundles. But the results I am familiar with are rather disparate and I was wondering whether some more coherent theory is known. In the ideal case giving a set of necessary and/or sufficient conditions (e.g. in terms of cohomology groups) or at least completely characterizing some nice class of manifolds (like for Lie groups, which are parallelizable; or for compact manifolds with non-zero Euler characteristic, which are not).","['differential-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

$$ I am not completely sure this is true since I haven't seen this result explicitly stated, but I Imagine it has to be true. The motivation for this comes from an exercise from Silverman's book The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves. I was doing the following exercise and I found that I needed the above mentioned fact in order for my argument for $(i) \implies (ii)$ to work. 2.5 Let $C$ be a smooth curve. Prove that the following are equivalent (over $\bar{K}$): (i) $C$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$. (ii) $C$ has genus $0$. (iii) There exist distinct points $P, Q \in C$ satisfying $(P) \sim (Q)$ I've thought about it but unfortunately I don't really see how to easily relate the dimensions of the Riemann Roch spaces associated to each curve.

46317,"What kind of ""symmetry"" is the symmetric group about?","There are two concepts which are very similar literally in abstract algebra: symmetric group and symmetry group . By definition, the symmetric group on a set is the group consisting of all bijections of the set (all one-to-one and onto functions) from the set to itself with function composition as the group operation. When the set is finite, the group is sometimes denoted as $S_n$. The Dihedral group $D_n$, which is a special case of the symmetry group,  has a very strong geometric intuition about symmetry as the picture shows. I know nothing about the relation between these two concepts but the fact that $D_3$ and $S_3$ are actually the same. For me, symmetric group is more about "" permutations "". And actually its subgroups are also called permutation groups . Here are my questions : What's the relation between these two concepts: ""symmetric group"" and
  ""symmetry group""? What kind of "" symmetry "" is the symmetric group about? Where is the name ""symmetric group"" from?","['math-history', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
46318,Two tetrahedra are congruent given a certain condition,"This question is inspired by a Miklos Schweitzer problem, namely Problem 9./2007 Let $A$ and $B$ be two triangles in the plane such that the interior of both triangles contains the origin, and for each circle $C_r$ centred at the origin $|C_r \cap A|=|C_r \cap B|$ (where $|\cdot|$ is the arclength measure). Prove that $A,B$ are congruent. Does this statement remain true if the origin lies on the border of $A$ or $B$? This problem can be solved relatively easy proving that the distances from the origin to the edges and the vertices of the two triangles are the same for $A$ and $B$. To do this, consider the circle $C_r$ ""growing"" until it first touches one side of $A$. If it doesn't touch a side of $B$, making $r$ a little bigger, we get a contradiction, since $C_r$ is still inside of $B$, but a part of it is outside $A$ now. Therefore, the distance from $O$ to the nearest side of $A,B$ is the same. Now consider the next side and so on. I was wondering how to apply the same reasoning to the following generalization of the problem: Consider two tetrahedra $A,B$ which both contain the origin in the interior, with the property that for any sphere $S_r$ centred at the origin we have that $|S_r \cap A|=|S_r \cap B|$ (where $|\cdot |$ is the area measure in $\Bbb{R}^3$). Prove that the two tetrahedra are congruent. For the triangle, it is enough to know that the distances from the origin to the sides and vertices are equal to prove that they are congruent. For the tetrahedron I feel I need something more.","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

The original proof for this lemma uses the following key property of the product of $\beta_1\beta_2$: The product can always be expressed in one of the following forms on the left:
  $$\begin{align}(ab)(ab)&=\epsilon\\
(ab)(ac)&=(bc)(ab)\\
(ab)(cd)&=(cd)(ab)\\

Using modular arithmetic you can prove that in all of these triplets $n \equiv 0 \pmod 8$ . Now I'm wondering, is there a way to find all such triplets? Below are two ways I've found which generate infinite triplets, but not all: Because $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2$, you can take any triplet (except $0, 1, 2$ which will give itself) and generate a new triplet. If $n, n+1, n+2$ is the chosen triplet then the following is also a triplet: $$n(n+2) = n^2 + 2n$$ $$(n+1)^2 + 0^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1$$ $$(n+1)^2 + 1^2 = n^2 + 2n + 2$$ Assume that there exists a triplet in the following form (letting $b^2 = 2a^2 + 1$): $$a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2$$ $$2a^2 + 1 = b^2 + 0^2$$ $$2a^2 + 2 = b^2 + 1$$ Solving $b^2 = 2a^2 + 1$ using the convergents for $\sqrt 2$ you'll find that every second convergent ($3/2$, $17/12$, $99/70$, etc.) will be in the form $b/a$.

I think the following rules may be helpful: The product of two even permutations is even. The product of two odd permutations is even. The product of an even permutation by an odd one (or of an odd one

46512,How to check whether an ideal is a prime (or maximal) ideal?,"I have a ring $R$ which is known to be a Dedekind domain, but not necessarily a  Euclidian domain, and a nonzero ideal generated by one or two elements in this ring. How can I check if this ideal is a prime ideal? For ideals generated by one element, this is equivalent to being a prime element in the ring. I programmed a clone of the Erathosthenes sieve for my ring, but this only shows me which elements are irreducible, which does not necessarily imply primality. To be more concrete, my ring $R$ is the ring of integers in an imaginary quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(d)$ (for $d$ a negative squarefree integer). These rings are of the form $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ or $R = \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1+\sqrt{-d}}{2}]$, depending on $d$. These are Dedekind domains, and every ideal there is generated by either one or two elements. For some $d$ (like $-1$, $-2$, $-3$), these are Euclidean domains, where I can use the division with remainder to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, meaning that each ideal is generated by one element. For others (like $d = -7$), there is no division with remainder, and we can't use the Euclidean algorithm. But even here it is not yet clear for me: how do I distinguish irreducible from prime elements? The most famous example: for $d = -5$ we have $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, and the element $2$ is not prime here, since $2 \cdot 3 = 6 = (1+\sqrt{-5})\cdot(1-\sqrt{-5})$ and 2 is not a factor of either term on the right side. By testing multiples, I can find numbers with different decompositions, and then know that those factors can't be prime. But when can I stop searching, if I don't find any? In this particular ring, the first elements not yet shown as either units, irreducible-not-prime or composite (after checking all elements until about $\pm 50 \pm 50i$) are $\pm \sqrt{-5}$, $\pm 4 \pm 2\sqrt{-5}$, $\pm 6 \pm \sqrt{-5}$. Could I be sure here that there really are prime? Another example, $d = -7$, $R = \mathbb{Z}[\frac{1+\sqrt{-7}}{2}] = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2+X+2)$: Here I find lots of irreducible-non-prime elements, and the only small ""irreducible and not yet shown as non-prime"" are $\pm \frac{1-\sqrt{-7}}{2}$. (The principal ideal generated by these elements look quite same as the one created by $\frac{1+\sqrt{-7}}{2}$, though - I think there is simply a glitch in my program.) This ring is non-Euclidean, and I suppose most (if not all but the zero ideal) prime ideals are generated by two elements here. If I have a candidate pair of elements, how do I find out if it is really a nonzero prime (= maximal) ideal? Any ideas here would helpful, since I'm a bit stuck here. (Most literature about computational ideal theory I found only works in polynomial rings over fields (and makes heavy use of this fact), thus it does not really help here.) (I'm writing a program which should then be able to work on any of these rings $R$ (and any ideals there), thus facts that are only valid in a small number of those rings are less helpful. But feel free to mention them nevertheless, maybe some of them can be generalized.)","['number-theory', 'computational-mathematics', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'ideals']"
46522,Maximum size of a rotated-then-cropped rectangle,"With regard to topic/question New size of a rotated-then-cropped rectangle : The answer by Isaac, the maximum area is $b^2\csc\alpha\sec\alpha$ when $x=0.5b\csc\alpha =\frac{0.5b}{\sin\alpha}$ seems to work for angles near $45$ degrees. However, its range of validity seems to be aspect ratio dependent. For $w/h$ aspect ratio $>> a/b$ , it works for a large range of angles, but for aspect ratio $= 1$ it only works at $45$ degrees. This is easily seen by using $\alpha$ nearly zero (very little rotation), then $\sin\alpha$ becomes nearly zero and $x$ becomes very large, certainly much larger than $a$ . Whereas the correct solution will be nearly the same size as the slightly rotated rectangle. The solution, $x=0.5b/\sin\alpha$ , leads to $y=0.5b/\cos\alpha$ . So when $x=y$ (upper right corner of inner rectangle) and $a=b$ (aspect ratio $=1$ ), we have $\sin\alpha = \cos\alpha$ , which is valid (in the first quadrant) only at $\alpha=45$ degrees. In particular, the limiting angle would appear to occur when $x=a$ , so that $\sin\alpha > 0.5b/a$ . It appears that within the valid range of this solution, only $2$ diagonal vertices of the inner rectangle touch the sides of the rotated rectangle. But in the invalid range, all four vertices of the inner rectangle touch an appropriate side of the rotated rectangle. I have tried solving this with lagrange multiplers and get the same answer. But I don't know how to put in an inequality constraint that $x\leq a$ . I am wondering if this can be solved closed form with a more general solution that gives a solution for any angle and any aspect ratio. Or at least another solution that works where this solution fails. So far I have been unsuccessful. A more general and similar problem has been solved by testing multiple conditions, but is not closed form. see http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~athens/cs507/Projects/2003/DanielSud/ I would appreciate hearing from the Mathematics experts on this.","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"

  B_{1} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
  0 & B_{2} & \cdots & 0 \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  0 & 0 & \cdots & B_{m}
 \end{pmatrix},$$ where each $B_{i}$ is an $m_{g}(\lambda_{i}) \times m_{g}(\lambda_{i})$ block ($m_{g}(\lambda_{i})$ being the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda_{i}$). My question Why is this so? I calculated an example and, lo and behold, it really works :-) But I don't understand how it works out so neatly.

Let us define the cone on any topological space $Y$ as $c(Y) = Y \times [0,1]$ where $Y \times \{0\}$ is shrunk to one point. Prove that for any compact, connected surface without boundary with Euler characteristic less than $1$ its cone is not homeomorphic to $c(S^2)$. The only thing I could do with it was to get it down to this (which is the same thing only with the characteristic requirement made explicit): $\forall n > 1$ $c(U_n)$ is not homeomorphic to $c(S^2)$ and $\forall n \geq 1$ $c(V_n)$ is not homeomorphic to $c(S^2)$. Where $U_n$ and $V_n$ are respectively standard non-orientable and orientable surfaces. Actually, something I just came up with is that they can't be homeomorphic because $S^2$ is not homeomorphic to any of those surfaces, thus every fiber of those cones isn't homeomorphic to any fiber of the cone on $S^2$; but I don't think that's enough, am I right?

(Assume suitable smoothness conditions.) A problem in the textbook for the course I am TEACHING (not taking) reduces to minimizing $w_1^2 + w_2^2 + w_3^2$ subject to $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 0, w_1 + 2w_2 + 3w_3 = 1$. Of course there's nothing special about the number $3$ here, and so one can ask for the minimum of $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2$ subject to $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 0, \sum_{i=1}^n iw_i = 1$. At least when $n = 3, 4, 5$, we get $w_i = c_n(i-(n+1)/2)$, for some constant $c_n$ which depends on $n$. So for fixed $n$, $w_i$ is a linear function of $i$. (This is a bit of an annoying computation, so I won't reproduce it here.) So it seems like there should be a continuous analogue of this. If we have 
$$ \int_0^1 f(x) \: dx = 0, \int_0^1 x f(x) \: dx = 1 $$

I got a feeling that this could be easily solved by applying theory of linear operators, but I cannot figure out how to reformulate the problem. To make this question less general we can assume that $y\in\ell_2$ and $C_k$ is symmetric positive-definite matrix for each $k$. This question is related to this one I've asked on mathoverflow. Update @fedja below produces a possible sketch of a proof. It requires though that $\|C_k^{-1}\|$ is bounded sequence (take the matrix norm $\|\|_2$). If we suppose that $C$ is a linear operator in $\ell_2$, does the property that each submatrix $C_k$ is positive-definite ensures that the sequence $\|C_k^{-1}\|$ is bounded? This question can be further rephrased the following way. For symmetric positive-definite matrix $A$ denote its minimal and maximal eigen values by $\lambda_{\min}$ and $\lambda_{\max}$. Then $\|A\|_2=\lambda_{\max}$ and $\|A^{-1}\|_2=\lambda_{\min}^{-1}$. With this in mind the previous question is identical whether $\lambda_{min}(C_k)$ is bounded away from zero.","['matrices', 'functional-analysis', 'limits']"

46926,Is Aluffi's book a good second text for Algebra?,"I have been trying to relearn parts of algebra (mostly module theory and (advanced)linear algebra) from Lang, which, frankly, is not going too well. Now, I have managed to get my hands on 'Aluffi - Algebra: Chapter 0'. And it (specifically the section called linear algebra reprise) seems pretty good. But, before I jump in and start studying from it, I want to make sure that I won't be repeating my experience with Lang. One indicator could be that it is a popular textbook. But, on searching, I found that it is not much used elsewhere. My question: Has anyone taken a formal/reading course using this book or studied it at length (not just leafed through it) and can thus recommend it and if it's possible (and not asking too much of their time) could they write briefly the course plan they followed? Added This is in response to KCd's comments What I am trying to do before next semester, is to take stock and make notes on some topics in Algebra generally taught in the first year of grad school (I am not in grad school. Will apply for Fall 2013). The notes will be (or on topics from) basic module theory, tensors, some exterior algebra, basic commutative algebra (an example of a topic would be Localization) (Some of these things I have learnt in courses such as Differential Geometry, etc.) For instance, in the note which will end with a proof of the structure theorem over PIDs (hopefully one that I am truly comfortable with), I began with defining free modules via universal property, instead of how I had learned it from Artin's book. Earlier, I thought I'll do this while relearning from Lang. But that's not serving me too well, for reasons I am not entirely clear about. Then I came upon Aluffi's book.

Prove that $[a,b]$ contains a real number not equal to any term of the sequence. I think I need to use the nested interval theorem: Theorem. If $(I_n)$ is a nested sequence of closed intervals, then the intersection of the $I_n$ is nonempty. In other words, if $I_n = [a_n, b_n]$, where $a_n \leq b_n$ and $I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \dots$ and $a = \sup \{a_n: n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \}$, $b = \inf \{b_n: n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \}$ then $a \leq b$ and $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} [a_n, b_n] = [a,b]$. It seems obvious if we know that the interval is uncountable and the sequence is countable. Or could you do the following: Pick an arbitrary element $x_0$ of $(x_n)$ in $[a,b]$ (if there is none then we are done). By denseness, there is a real number $\alpha$ between $a$ and $x_0$. If $\alpha$ is in the sequence pick another number $\alpha_1$ between $a$ and $\alpha$. Keep doing this until you find a number not in the sequence. Would this idea work?",['real-analysis']

At some point I (along with everyone and their brother) classified finite groups with four conjugacy classes, but I never really looked beyond that until today.

Suppose that $P \in C$ and that $P$ is a smooth point. It is known that in this case the local ring of $C$ at $P$, $K[C]_P$ is a discrete valuation ring with valuation given by $$
\text{ord}_P (f) := \sup{\{d \in \mathbb{Z} \mid f \in M_{P}^{d}  \}} 
$$ where $M_P$ is the maximal ideal of $K[C]_P$ and this definition can be extended to any function $\dfrac{f}{g} \in K(C)$ by $$

$$ Now the problem for me is that this definition literally does not let me compute anything. It just does not seem easy to me to compute the order of a function by using this definition and this is causing me trouble for understanding how to compute the divisor associated to a function and also how to compute differentials since I need to be able to compute the order of functions at the points in the curve. On the other hand, for the particular case of the curve $\mathbb{P}^1$, since its function field $K(\mathbb{P}^1) \cong K(t)$ is so nice, I'm able to compute the order of a function relatively easy by looking at the order of the zero or pole of the corresponding rational function in one variable. I would be very grateful if someone can explain how can one compute the order of a function at some point. The examples given in Silverman's book The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves (which is the book I'm reading) just give the result but don't provide any explanation. Example This example is very important for me to understand since it comes again in the chapter about the Geometry of Elliptic Curves, so if someone can explain how to compute at least the orders calculated there, I guess that I can pick up from there. Assume that $\text{char}(K) \neq 2$, and let $e_1, e_2, e_3 \in K$ be distinct. Consider the curve $$
C: y^2 = (x - e_1)(x - e_2)(x - e_3)
$$ Then if we denote the points $P_i := (e_i, 0)$ we have $$
\text{div}(x - e_i) = 2(P_i) - 2(\infty)
$$ and also $$
\text{div}( y ) = (P_1) + (P_2) + (P_3) - 3(\infty)

47030,Why does this distribution of polynomial roots resemble a collection of affine IFS fractals?,"Consider the following spectacular image, created by Sam Derbyshire and described in John Baez's article "" The Beauty of Roots "": In this image are plotted all the complex roots of all polynomials of degree $\le 24$ with coefficients drawn from the set $\{-1, 1\}$. There is some amazing structure in there, about which many questions can be asked! The symmetries about the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the unit circle are easily explained, though: it is not hard to show that if $z$ is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in $\{-1,1\}$, then so are $\bar z$, $-z$, and $z^{-1}$. Please do look at John Baez's aforementioned article for more zoomed images showing the beautiful detail in this distribution of roots. In particular, towards the interior of the unit circle, the distribution does not fall off smoothly, but seems to form fractal patterns, such as near $z = 4/5$ , near $z = 4i/5$ , and near $z = e^{i/5}/2$ . In fact, these patterns are extremely reminiscent of the images produced by iterated function systems of affine transformations. With a little experimentation using David Eck's Chaos Game applet , I found that to produce fractals similar to these patterns, one only needs to use two affine maps, both of which are the composition of a scaling by about 70% and a rotation by $\arg z$, and differ by a translation. To illustrate: I'm tempted to say that the whole distribution looks like a catalogue of such affine IFSs, the way the Mandelbrot set is like a catalogue of Julia sets . My question is simple: Why is this so? What is the reason that the roots of $\{-1,1\}$ polynomials form such a fractal distribution, that behaves locally like an affine IFS?","['fractals', 'roots', 'complex-analysis', 'polynomials']"

47091,Invariant proof of the Contracted Bianchi Identity,"In ""Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature,"" John Lee states the following lemma: Lemma 7.7 (Contracted Bianchi Identity): The covariant derivatives of the Ricci and scalar curvatures satisfy $$\text{div} Rc = \frac{1}{2}\nabla S,$$ where $\text{div} Rc$ is the 1-tensor obtained from $\nabla Rc$ by raising one index and contracting.  In components, this is $$R_{ij};^j = \frac{1}{2}S_{;i}.$$ Lee then proves the coordinate form of the statement.  He does this by (metric) contracting the differential Bianchi identity in coordinates $$R_{ijkl;m} + R_{ijlm;k} + R_{ijmk;l} = 0.$$ I have two questions: Is there a more coordinate-free proof of this fact?  I suppose one can argue (in words) that contractions are coordinate-invariant and such, but I would prefer seeing a proof in symbols nevertheless. Can we prove the identity directly from the symmetry of the Ricci tensor? My second question was inspired by the following computation: Evaluating the left-hand side at a vector field $X$: $$(\text{div}Rc)(X) = (\text{tr}_g\nabla Rc)(X),$$
while similarly on the right-hand side:
$$\frac{1}{2}(\nabla S)(X) = \frac{1}{2}\nabla_XS = \frac{1}{2}\nabla_X(\text{tr}_gRc) = \frac{1}{2}\text{tr}_g(\nabla_XRc).$$
So, we can prove the Contracted Bianchi Identity if we can show that $$(\text{tr}_g\nabla Rc)(X) = \frac{1}{2}\text{tr}_g(\nabla_XRc),$$ which might somehow follow from the symmetry of $Rc$.

47095,"Geometric interpretation of connection forms, torsion forms, curvature forms, etc","I have just begun learning about the connection 1-forms , torsion 2-forms , and curvature 2-forms in the context of Riemannian manifolds.  However, I am finding it hard to relate these notions to any sort of geometric intuition. How can one interpret these differential forms geometrically?  Or at least, what is the motivation for considering such objects?  What sort of information do they provide? Edit: I should clarify that I think I have somewhat of an intuition for connections, the curvature tensor, and (to a lesser extent) the torsion tensor.  What I am asking about are the connection forms, torsion forms, and curvature forms.","['differential-forms', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"
47103,Doob's inequality in probability,"In the book ""Optimal Stopping and Free-Boundary Problems"" there is given Doob's inequality of the following form. Let $X = (X_t,F_t)$ be a submartingale. Then for any $\varepsilon>0$ and each $T>0$
  $$
\mathsf P\left\{\sup\limits_{t\leq T}|X_t|\geq \varepsilon\right\}\leq \frac 1\varepsilon \sup\limits_{t\leq T}\,\,\,\mathsf E\,|X_t|.
$$ On the other hand, George Lowther presented the following example. Let $X_0 = 0$, 
$$
X_1 = \begin{cases}
1, &\quad p = 1/3;
\\
0, &\quad p = 1/3;
\\
-1,&\quad p =1/3.
\end{cases}
$$
and $X_2 = 1$ if $X_1 = 1$, $X_2 = 0$ if $X_1 = -1$ and $$
X_2 = \begin{cases}
1, &\quad p = 1/2; \
-1,&\quad p =1/2.
\end{cases}
$$
if $X_1 = 0$. Finally, $X_n = X_2$ for all $n\geq 2$. It is easy to check that this is a submartingale. On the other hand, for $\varepsilon = 1$ we have
$$
\mathsf P\left\{\sup\limits_{n\leq 2}|X_n|\geq 1\right\} = 1
$$
but $\mathsf E[|X_0|] = 0$, $\mathsf E[|X_1|] = 2/3$ and $\mathsf E[|X_2|] = 2/3$ - so we have inequality $1\leq 2/3$. Could you help with finding a mistake since I am confused? The reference can be seen here: http://books.google.com/books?id=UinZbLqpUDEC&pg=PA60&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false page 62.

47106,rational points of an algebraic variety,"In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_point we read : a $K$ -rational point is a point on an algebraic variety where each coordinate of the point >belongs to the field $K$ . This means that, if the variety is given by a set of equations $$f_i(x_1, ..., x_n)=0,\; j=1, \cdots, m$$ then the $K$ -rational points are solutions $(x_1, ..., x_n)\in K^n$ of the equations My understanding is that the algebraic variety is the set of solutions $(x_1, ..., x_n)\in K^n$ of the equations so by definition all points of the algebraic variety are $K$ -rational points.. I'm I wrong? so what is the meaning of defining rational points if all points of ther alg variety are rational?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'number-theory']"
47114,Solving Coupled Eigenvalue equations,"I wish to solve the following set of coupled eigenvalue equations. How should I do it? For real matrices $A$,$B$,$D$ and vectors $x \in R^m$, $y \in R^n$
$$
A x + B y = \lambda x
$$
$$
B^T x + D y = \mu y
$$
where, $A$ and $D$ are symmetric. Background: I am trying to solve the following optimization problem: $$
\min x^T A x + y^T D y + x^T By
$$
$$
\textrm{such that } \, x^T x = 1 , y^T y = 1
$$
This leads to the above eigenvalue problem. $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Langrangian parameters for the constraints. EDIT: I need to actually find numerical solutions for these equations given $A$, $B$, $D$","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"
