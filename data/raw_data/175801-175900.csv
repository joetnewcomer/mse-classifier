3149463,The $n$th derivative of $f(e^x)$,"Because it comes up every so often, I was wondering if there was a nice general expansion for the $n$ th derivative of $f(e^x)$ . $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx}f(e^x)=e^xf'(e^x)$ $\frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dx^2}f(e^x)=e^xf'(e^x)+e^{2x}f''(e^x)$ $\frac{\mathrm d^3}{\mathrm dx^3}f(e^x)=e^xf'(e^x)+3e^{2x}f''(e^x)+e^{3x}f'''(e^x)$ $\vdots$ One can see that we end up with the form $$\frac{\mathrm d^n}{\mathrm dx^n}f(e^x)=\sum_{k=1}^nC(n,k)e^{kx}f^{(k)}(e^x)$$ for some constants $C(n,k)$ . I've found that it reduces to solving the following recurrence relation: $$C(n,k)=\begin{cases}0,&n<k\\1,&n>0\land k=1\\kC(n-1,k)+C(n-1,k-1),&n>0\land k>1\end{cases}$$ From which you can deduce things such as $C(n,2)=2^{n-1}-1$ . Is there a nice general solution?","['recurrence-relations', 'calculus', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series', 'derivatives']"

You are doing the last question and you are clearly wrong, you have no time to redo the question.  what should you do?  my theory says that you should try to make one of your calculations wrong,  because if you are one hundred percent sure you are wrong and you are making a mistake at being wrong,  than you increase your chances of being right.

3149577,Differentiating areas of polygons with respect to its inscribed circle,"When I was an undergraduate, I attempted to generalize the common observation that $\dfrac{d}{dr} \pi r^{2} = 2\pi r$ for other shapes (that is, when is the derivative of area equal to perimeter for some other shape?). My finding was that for any regular polygon, differenting the area of a regular polygon with respect to the radius of its inscribed circle will give its perimeter as a function of the radius of its inscribed circle. I detailed my experience with the problem here ( https://youtu.be/0vYWsOBBXxw ), and because of the experience I had with it (starting with a common observation, finding a pattern, making a conjecture, and then proving it) I have given a talk on the problem to the undergraduate math majors at my university a couple of times, I think the problem has a lot of pedogogical value at that level. Anyways, last week, I gave the talk, and one of the professors that attended remarked that he thinks that the general result here is that given any polygon, if we find its ""center of mass"", then the measurement we want is the shortest distance from the center of mass to the edge of the polygon. Can anyone comment on what the more general result is here? That is, in describing ""when the derivative of area is perimeter"", what's the most general statement we can say about the most general shapes? Or, how could we show that the center of mass to edge is always the measurement we want?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"
3149579,Summing over set of sets,"I am having trouble trying to understand an expression based on the multivariate Taylor series which is used to generate a system of residual equations.

R_i(v_1,\dots,v_n)=\sum\limits_{r=1}^{d_i}\frac{1}{r!}\sum\limits_{(j_1,\cdots,j_r)\\1\leq j_k\leq n\\j_1,\cdots,j_r \in A(i)} \frac{\partial^rR_i}{\partial v_{j_i}\cdots\partial v_{j_r}} \prod\limits_{k=1}^{r}v_{j_k}

From this description I assume $A(i)$ is a function that returns the power set for a given list of elements, e.g. $A([1,2])=\{\{\},\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$ . My point of confusion is the summation term and its three conditions. Is it a single sum over all elements $(j_1,\cdots,j_r)$ in the power set, giving four terms in the sum? Or is it a nested sum $\sum\limits_{j_1}\sum\limits_{j_2}\cdots\sum\limits_{j_r}$ where each sum is performed over the sets in the power set? How would the empty set or a set like $j_k=\{1,2\}$ be substituted as a single index into $v_{j_k}$ ?","['elementary-set-theory', 'summation', 'notation', 'taylor-expansion']"

3149814,Is there a general theory of when certain polynomials are integrable due to symmetry tricks?,"Consider the functions $x^2$ and $x^4 + 2x^2y^2$ on the unit sphere $S^2$ .

3149858,(Calculus) Derivative Thinking Question,"Recently, my Calculus and Vectors (Grade 12) teacher gave our class a thinking question/assignment to work on over the march break, and after working on for some time, I've become stuck on it. The Question: Consider f( x ) , a general quadratic function in standard form, and g( x ) its reciprocal. For which values of x are the slopes of their respective tangent lines equal? Consider two cases: one where it is true for exactly one value of x , and the other where it is true for exactly two values of x . In the latter case, you can assume that the steepness a does not equal 0 of f( x ) is equal to both it’s y -intercept and also to the slope of its tangent at x = 1 . Find the required conditions on the parameters a , b , c in terms of a . My Progress So Far: So I know that $f(x) = ax^2 +bx + c$ and $g(x) = 1/f(x)$ . After I solved for the derivative of each function, I set them both equal to each other and started solving for it. But then I came to a equation of $(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 = -1$ and that doesn't work. Next I tried something else. Since I know from the 2nd case that $f(x) = c$ and $f(x) = f'(1)$ when a cannot equal 0, I set $c = f'(1)$ and got $c = 2a + b$ . But after that, I don't know where to go. I'm not expecting a full solution, but if anyone could give me a hint for solving this question, I would appreciate it. I know that it says to write everything in terms of a, but I'm not sure how to approach that method.","['tangent-line', 'calculus', 'slope', 'derivatives', 'quadratics']"
3149871,compactness of a set where am I going wrong,"I have a proof of the following false fact : Let $E$ be normed vector space. Let $K \subset E$ be a compact set. Then the set $B = \{\lambda x \mid \lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+, x \in K \}$ is closed (where $\mathbb{R}^+$ are the positive real numbers including $0$ ). This fact is true when $0 \not \in K$ yet it can be false when $0 \in K$ . For example by taking the semi-circle in the plane centered at $(1,0)$ of radius $1$ . So I made a proof a of this fact. My proof is thus obviously false yet I don't see where the mistake is : Let $(\lambda_n k_n)$ be a sequence in $B$ which converges to a vector $x \in E$ . We want to prove that $x \in B$ . Since $K$ is compact there is $\phi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ strictly increasing such that $(k_{\phi(n)})$ converges to a vector $k \in K$ . If $ k = 0$ then the sequence $(\lambda_n k_n)$ converges to $0 \in B$ and we are done. So we can suppose $k \ne 0$ . Since the sequence $(\lambda_n k_n)$ converges to $x$ we must have $k \in span \{ x \}$ . So there is $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^*$ such that $k = \mu x$ . From here we can deduce that the sequence $(\lambda_n)$ necessarily converges to $\frac{1}{\mu}$ . Yet since $\mathbb{R}^+$ is closed the sequence $(\lambda_n)$ converges to a positive real number, so $\frac{1}{\mu} \geq 0$ so $\mu \geq 0$ . 
So the sequence $(\lambda_n k_n)$ converges to the vector $\frac{1}{\mu} k \in B$ since $k \in K$ and $\frac{1}{\mu} \geq 0$ . Hence $B$ is closed. So where am I going wrong here ? Thank you !","['general-topology', 'proof-verification', 'compactness', 'real-analysis']"

\end{align} What am I doing wrong? I notice I do not use the existence of $\tilde{T}$ . Second Attempt: Assume $\langle x_{n},x\rangle \rightarrow \langle x,x\rangle$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle &= \langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle=\langle Tx,y\rangle.
\end{align} Therefore, $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Third Attempt: Assume $\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle=\langle x_{n}-x,x_{n}-x\rangle=\|x_{n}-x\|^{2}.
\end{align} By assumption $\|x_{n}-x\|^{2}\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Hence, \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle = \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty.
\end{align} Therefore, $T$ is continuous. Fourth Attempt Assume $x_{n}\rightarrow x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle =\langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle =\langle Tx,y\rangle.
\end{align} Since $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ weakly, we know $Tx:=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}Tx_{n}$ exists which implies that $T\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{H})$ . Hence $\|T\|<\infty$ . So, \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle &= \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\\
&\leq\|Tx_{n}-Tx\|=\|T(x_{n}-x)\|\\
&\leq\|T\|\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty.
\end{align} Therefore $T$ is continuous. Fifth Attempt Assume $x_{n}\rightarrow x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ . Then, given $\langle Tx,y\rangle = \langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle$ , \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle =\langle x_{n},\tilde{T}y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle x,\tilde{T}y\rangle =\langle Tx,y\rangle.
\end{align} Hence $Tx_{n}\rightarrow Tx$ weakly. Define $f_{x}(y):=\langle Tx,y\rangle$ , then $f_{x}:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a linear operator. Now, \begin{align}
f_{x_{n}}(y)=\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}\langle Tx,y\rangle=f_{x}(y).
\end{align} Further, \begin{align}
|f_{x_{n}}(y)|=|\langle Tx_{n},y\rangle|\leq\|Tx_{n}\|\|y\|\implies\|f_{x_{n}}\|\leq\|Tx_{n}\|.
\end{align} Also, \begin{align}
\|f_{x_{n}}\|\geq\frac{|f_{x_{n}}(Tx_{n})|}{\|Tx_{n}\|}=\|Tx_{n}\|.
\end{align} Hence, $\|f_{x_{n}}\|=\|Tx_{n}\|$ . We now show $\|f_{x_{n}}\|_{\infty}<\infty$ , \begin{align}
|f_{x_{n}}(Tx)|=|\langle Tx_{n},Tx\rangle|\rightarrow_{n\rightarrow\infty}|\langle Tx,Tx\rangle|=\|Tx\|^{2},
\end{align} hence, $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|f_{x_{n}}(Tx_{n})|<\infty$ and so by the UBP $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\|f_{x_{n}}\|<\infty$ . This implies $\|Tx_{n}\|<\infty$ for all $x_{n}$ and so $\|T\|<\infty$ . Hence, \begin{align}
\langle Tx_{n}-Tx,Tx_{n}-Tx\rangle &= \|Tx_{n}-Tx\|^{2}\\
&\leq\|Tx_{n}-Tx\|=\|T(x_{n}-x)\|\\
&\leq\|T\|\|x_{n}-x\|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }n\rightarrow\infty.
\end{align} Therefore $T$ is continuous.","['hilbert-spaces', 'continuity', 'functional-analysis']"
3149993,Dice rolling probability game,"In a hockey-themed board game, players start the game in the penalty box. If rolling the same number on both dice is required to escape from the penalty box, and Piper, Quincy, and Riley take turns, in he order named, rolling a pair of standard six sided dice, what is the probability that Piper is the last player to escape from the penalty box? My initial thought was that riley and quincy both escape with a 1/36 probability. So, we multiply the three together getting $\frac{1}{36^3}$ , but this is clearly incorrect. Then I took more thinking to this problem. To satisfy the problem we need Piper to lose her first throw, Quincy to win her throw, Riley to win her throw, then Piper will eventually win her throw. So we have $\dfrac{5}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot = \dfrac{5}{6^{3}}$ . However, there other cases where Piper looses, Quincy looses, Riley looses, Piper looses, then Quincy and Riley wins, or where Riley wins before Quincy. So this can account into what I'm thinking of an infinitely long geometric sequence that later converges to a rational number. There are many, many more cases. To account for this, I have to keep analyzing all possibilities at each turn, and I believe that eventually I will get some geometric progressions. However, this seems tedious and error prone. So then I thought that I could just denote the probabilities that I am interested in by letters and write some equations. For instance, if the probability of Piper escaping last is $p$ , then after a turn in which nobody escapes the probability of Piper escaping last is still $p$ . This allows me to write the equation: $$p= {5\over 6}^3\cdot p +\text{other cases }.$$ But however, I cannot seem to find that ""other cases"" thing, and I even further doubted that the $p$ in the equation is stable. But after some further examination, I find this is not so. I considered first the case with two players: Let $p$ be the probability that the player who starts first escapes first and $q$ the probability that the second player escapes first. I could write the equation $p=1/6+5/6\cdot q$ because the probability of the first player escaping is 1/6 plus the probability of him not escaping (5/6) times the probability of him winning as second player, because now the other player rolls the dice first. Another equation I could write is $p+q=1$ because one of them will escape eventually (with probability 1). Solving this I get $p=1/6+5/6(1-p)$ etc. which leads to $p=6/11$ . This is incorrect. And, after a long time of thoughts, I finally figured the way to write the infinite sum, $p=1/6 + (5/6)^2\cdot 1/6+(5/6)^4\cdot 1/6+\dots$ , because the probability of the first player escaping first is 1/6 (if he rolls a double) + (5/6)^2 (=probability of both not rolling a double) times 1/6 (rolling a double at the second turn) and so on... The sum of that infinite progression is $$p=1/6\cdot {1\over 1-(5/6)^2}$$ which still gives $6/11$ , and is wrong again. I cannot think of a way to continue. Help please?",['probability']
3150078,Find the quotient group of an infinite subgroup.,"From what I understand, to find the quotient group requires knowing all cosets of a subgroup. I know what a coset is defined, but when it comes to infinite groups, I'm a bit confused. For example, Here's a group $[R;+]$ , and one of its normal subgroup $[Z;+]$ . Find all cosets of $Z$ in $R$ . I was thinking: 1. For $0 \in R$ , $0+Z=Z+0=Z$ , so $Z$ itself is a coset. 2. For $0.1 \in R$ , we get a group $G=\{\cdots,0.1,1.1,2.1,\cdots\}$ . Clearly $G \ne Z$ , so $G$ is a different coset from $Z$ . Things will get similar if I do it by $0.01 \in R$ . It seems that I actually cannot list all cosets of $Z$ or sepecify what these cosets are like. But then how should I describe the quotient group (of $R$ ) if I cannot write down what these cosets are? Here's another example which I can specify cosets: Here's a group $[R^*:=\{x\ne 0 \mid x \in R\};\cdot]$ and one of its normal subgroup $[R^+:=\{x>0\mid x \in R\}]$ . Find all cosets of $R^+$ in $R^*$ . $R^*$ can be partitioned into positive real numbers $R^+$ and negative real numbers $R^-$ . 1. If a real number $r>0$ , $rR^+=R^+r=R^+$ ; 2. If a real number $r<0$ , $rR^+=R^+r=R^-$ . Now we say $[\{R^+,R^-\};\cdot]$ is a quotient group of $R^+$ in $R^*$ . Go back to the first example and even further: under a more general circumstance, what should I do to find the quotient group? Any kind help would be appreciated.","['quotient-group', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

I came up with two different solutions to the problem but the answers come out differently. The first solution uses symmetry:
There are $\binom{239}{40}$ possible ways to place $200$ balls in $40$ jars. We then subtract all possibilities where the number of balls in the first $20$ jars is equal to the number of balls in the last $20$ jars, which is equal to $\binom{119}{20}^2$ . We then exploit symmetry (the number of possibilities that there are more balls in the first $20$ jars is equal to the number of possibilities that there are more balls in the last twenty jars). The final answer is $$\frac{\binom{239}{40} - \binom{119}{20}^2}{2}$$ The second solution uses a sum. It comes out to $$\sum_{k=101}^{200} \binom{k+19}{20}\binom{219-k}{20}$$",['combinatorics']

There is some background information for my questions, so thanks in advance for reading. Below is the background for my questions: Let's say we have random pixel generator with a square screen which has $10 \times 10$ resolution (100 pixels in total, each pixel can have 3 colors) In order to calculate the probability of having at least one $2 \times 2$ same color square block on that screen, I'm applying the following calculation based on complement probability: $1-(26/27)^{81}=95\%$ approximately. (There are 81 different $2 \times 2$ blocks on $10 \times 10$ grid. Odds of having there are at least two different colors in $2 \times 2$ square block is $26/27$ ) I was told that all computer modeling/simulations calculate the probability of having at least one $2 \times 2$ same color block as approximately 93%, a little less than what I calculated with my basic approach. On this $10 \times 10$ square screen while center pixels can be part of 4 different square blocks, corner pixels each can be only part of 1 square block and pixels on the edges can be part of 2 different squares. I thought this is the reason why I ended up with higher probability. However, I was informed that I behaved each $2 \times 2$ square blocks independently, therefore, I disregarded intersection of $2 \times 2$ multicolor blocks that create $2 \times 2$ same color square blocks. Therefore rather than positions of the pixel I indicate above, the fact that I behaved each $2 \times 2$ independently did give incorrect probability. My Questions I was also told by someone else that if my $10 \times 10$ grid was the plane of a torus (doughnut shape) or Klein bottle (Mobius strip) first column would be next to the tenth column & first row would be next to the tenth row which allows all $2 \times 2$ pixels can be part of 4 squares, therefore my basic calculation would work. -Is this logic correct? Is there a flaw in my calculation related to the shape of the screen or is it related to independence of events? Because no matter which shape the screen is $2 \times 2$ square blocks will be always intersecting because they are dependent. - Is there a mathematical formula that allows us to calculate this probability on different planes? Are computer simulations adjustable based on different planes?","['statistics', 'differential-geometry', 'complex-analysis', 'combinatorics', 'random-variables']"

However, I strongly believe that (since the support of $\varphi_V$ gets smaller and smaller as the net index $V$ shrinks to $\{e\}$ ) the quantity $(f:\varphi_V)$ should be a good approximation of $\int_G f\operatorname{d}\mu$ if $V$ is small enough, so that equality should hold, but I can't prove rigorously this claim.

3150633,The number of elements not in conjugate of a subgroup,"There is a proposition about the number of elements not lying in any conjugate of a subgroup when the group is finite. It states: If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a proper subgroup, then the number of elements not in any conjugate of $H$ is at least $|H|$ . (See, for example, Isaac's Finite Group Theory Page 7. However, I wonder whether the statement still holds when $G$ is an infinite group. I suppose it's not so hard to prove the statement for the infinite case, but I failed to find a way. Though it's clear that the statement holds when $G$ has an element with infinite order, I couldn’t find a way if I already get $G$ has a finite subgroup contains $H$ and the existence of a such subgroup is something I can't work out as the bounded Burnside problem shows there exists finitely generated infinite group with every element having a bounded order. In fact, if there's any estimation about this number of elements not in conjugate of a subgroup, it'll be helpful!

These spaces give rise to two classes of metric spaces, namely the ""big"" ones into which Baire space embeds as a closed subset and the ""small"" ones which are ""easily covered"" by Cantor space, that is, which are the continuous image of $2^\omega\times\omega$ . For example, $\mathbb{R}$ is small in this sense, since $[-n,n]$ is a compact metric space for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and every compact metric space is the continuous image of Cantor space . In fact, this last fact shows that ""small"" is just "" $\sigma$ -compact."" Each ""natural"" separable metric space that I can think of is either big or small in this sense, and this raises the following question: Suppose $M$ is a separable metric space which doesn't contain a closed set homeomorphic to Baire space and is homeomorphic to a Borel subset of Baire space (I'll also accept more complicated examples as long as they are ""reasonably natural,"" e.g. exist in $L(\mathbb{R})$ assuming large cardinals) .

3150879,Burnside's lemma adding constants $\pmod{10}.$,"Problem: On how many ways can you color the numbers $0$ to $9$ with
  two different colors (say red and blue) if the colorings are counted
  as the same when they can be transferred to eachother by adding a
  constant mod $10$ ? For example, a coloring where the numbers $2,4$ and $9$ are red is
  counted as the same as the coloring where $5,7$ and $2$ are red since
  the latter is obtained by adding 3 in mod $10$ . My attempt: So each addition of constant can be thought of rotating the ring $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ once so that $0\rightarrow 1,1\rightarrow 2$ , etc. So if we add the constant $5$ we get $0\rightarrow 5,1\rightarrow 6$ etc. Thus the group of symmetries is $$G=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, \quad |G|=10.$$ Now we need to find the fixes of $g$ and compute $$\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\text{Fix}(g).$$ The identity does nothing, meaning that no matter how we colour these $10$ numbers, they are always fixed, thus there are $2^{10}$ fixes for this symmetry. Adding $1$ changes all the colors of all the spots, the only way our settings are fixed is if we color all the numbers blue or all the numbers red, thus we have two different colorings giving $2^2$ fixes. I'm stuck. I don't know how to think through this. I feel there should be some easier way.","['group-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

In the end, we will need to have $D$ has a directed cycle and this will contradict. However, the necessity is very hard to prove.

Then I made some euristic argument: I know that the probability, as $n \to +\infty$ , that two random numbers $a,b\in \{ 1, \dots ,n \}$ are coprime is $$\zeta(2)^{-1} = \frac{6}{\pi^2},$$ thus the probability that $\gcd(a,b)=d$ is equal to $$\frac{\zeta(2)^{-1}}{d^2} = \frac{6}{d^2\pi^2}$$ Thus our probability is (and here is where I have doubts in my argument) $$\sum_{d=1}^n \ \frac{\zeta(2)^{-1}}{d^2} \to \frac{1}{\zeta(2)} \cdot \zeta(2) =1$$ EDIT: or maybe my last step should be $$\sum_{d=1}^n \ \frac{\zeta(2)^{-1}}{d^2} \frac{1}{d} \to \frac{\zeta(3)}{\zeta(2)}$$","['number-theory', 'limits', 'probability-limit-theorems', 'gcd-and-lcm']"

3151717,Is every filtration the natural filtration of some stochastic process?,"We have a notion of natural filtrations, which intuitively represents the history of the process as the process evolves over time. We also have a notion of filtrations in general, which are increasing sequence of sub-sigma algebras. Naturally, the latter concept is more abstract than the former, and I am having trouble getting a concrete grip on the latter. In particular, if we have a stochastic process X, and a filter F, I tend to look at F as a natural filtration (although we only know it's a filtration in general, and not necessarily a natural one) of some other process Y. Can we do that? As to why I am doing what I am doing, in many practical scenarios (like quantitative finance, which I am studying), we would be directly observing the process Y (say Y is the share price process) and hence our information would be the natural filtration of Y, but we might be interested in a slightly different process X (which might be the log of the share price or some other functional transformation say). In this scenario, the natural filtration of Y is simply a filtration from the perspective of X , and not a natural one. Thanks a lot in advance!","['filtrations', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

3151743,Methodology for Verifying Trigonometric Identities,"Lets say I have an equation like: $$\frac{\sin^2x+\cos^2x}{\cos^2x\sec^2x}=1$$ Our teacher said you have to verify the equality by simplifying the left hand side or the right hand side without moving(doing operations to both sides) anything from one side of the equation to the other. 
I have a problem with this because I proposed that we can verify the equality by multiplying the denominator by 1 and moving it to the other side. Then you can proceed to verify the equation by substituting trig identities. My argument is that if correct algebraic manipulation is done, then the equality is the same. It won't suddenly become false or true. My method:
**the addition to the classical method is that you can multiply the equation by both sides while preserving the equality which is specifically not multiplying by 0 or applying operators such as derivatives or squaring etc as these do not preserve equalities. $$\sin^2x+\cos^2x = \cos^2x·\sec^2x$$ $$1=\frac{\cos^2x·1}{\cos^2x}$$ $$1=1$$ equality is true It requires ingenuity to be able to do the right manipulations... Is my teacher justified in requiring that nothing is moved between the sides? is there a convincing argument for my side or am I wrong? 
I would be grateful if someone can enlighten me; just why is it wrong to do algebraic manipulation before verifying an equality? Keep in mind that this method is meant to be extended to the more complicated problems. I just gave a simple example to illustrate it. For reiteration and clarity, my question is why is my method wrong?
