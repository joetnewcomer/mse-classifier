316174,measurability and convergence of unconditional probability measure,"This should be simple, and with a bit of study I should get there, but I am very tired and in a need for a hand. Thanks in advance. If $\rho$ is a probability measure over $Y$. For each $y \in Y$ there is a measure $\mu_y$ over $X$, (you can assume $X=Y=[0,1]$). If I wish to define the unconditional measure $\mu$ over $X$, $\mu(A)=\int _{y \in Y} \mu_y(A) \partial \rho$, for any $A \in \sigma_X$ ( $\sigma$-algebra can be Borel). When is $\mu$ measurable? Do I need any special condition on $\mu_y$? If $\rho^n$ converges weakly to $\rho$, $\rho^n \Rightarrow \rho$ and $\mu_y^n \Rightarrow \mu_y$ for all $y \in Y$, does $\mu^n  \Rightarrow \mu$?","['probability-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-probability']"
316175,"Probability to choose specific item in a ""weighted sampling without replacement"" experiment","Given $n$ items with weight $w_n$ each -- what is the probability that item $i$ is chosen in a $k$-out-of-$n$ ""weighted random sampling without replacement"" experiment? Can a closed-form solution that depends only on $w_i / w_\cdot$ be derived ($w_\cdot = \sum_j w_j$.)? EDIT : A solution that depends only on $w_i / w_\cdot$ is impossible. Assume $n=3$, $i=1$, $w_1 = 1$, and two cases: (1) $w_2 = 1, w_3 = 1 + \varepsilon$, (2) $w_2 = 2, w_3 = \varepsilon > 0$. In case (1) the probability is almost $2/3$, in case (2) it is almost $1$, but in both cases $w_1 = 1$ and $w_\cdot = 3 + \varepsilon$. What I have tried so far to solve the problem: Let $P^n_k(w, i)$ be the probability that item $i$ is chosen in an $k$-out-of-$n$ experiment with weight vector $w$.
In the first draw, the item is chosen with probability $w_i / w_\cdot$. Otherwise, we are looking for the probability to choose this item in a $k-1$-out-of-$n-1$ experiment, with the same weight vector except for the item that has been selected. Hence: $$
P^n_k(w, i) = w_i / w_\cdot + \sum_{j \neq i} w_j / w_\cdot \cdot P^{n-1}_{k-1}(w - j, i)
$$
$$
= w_\cdot^{-1} \left( w_i + \sum_{j \neq i} w_j \cdot P^{n-1}_{k-1}(w - j, i) \right)
$$ with $w-j$ being ""the vector $w$ without the $j$th element"". How to solve this recurrence relation? (If it is correct at all...)","['probability-theory', 'sampling', 'probability']"

316208,Difference between orthogonal and orthonormal matrices,"Let $Q$ be an $N \times N$ unitary matrix (its columns are orthonormal). Since $Q$ is unitary, it would preserve the norm of any vector $X$ , i.e., $\|QX\|^2 = \|X\|^2$ . My confusion comes when the columns of $Q$ are orthogonal, but not orthonormal, i.e., if the columns are weighted by weights $w_1,\dots,w_N$ , the dot product of any two different columns would still be zero, but $Q^H Q \neq I$ anymore. What are these matrices called? The literature always refers to matrices with orthonormal columns as orthogonal, however I think that's not quite accurate.

316248,Philosophy of learning mathematics (combinatorics),"How does one learn mathematics in depth and well? I think I may be studying mathematics incorrectly, or I could be doing it a lot more efficiently/effectively. Sometimes I feel like I need every argument repeated to me at least three times (this can be exhausting and it takes a lot of time when I have so much to learn). I think I am learning which areas of mathematics that I like best and am starting to partition my time to focus on the areas that I enjoy the most. With that in mind, How can I become proficient in Combinatorics? Most of what I hear and have read from other people is to do a lot of problems. I am looking for a magical set of problems that will make me a lot better at combinatorics (I am aware that this is unrealistic). Can someone give me some references though or some sort of reading list? Is there a common book that a serious student in combinatorics should have? I am planning to listen to the advice of doing a lot of problems and going through an entire book. With that in mind, does anyone know of a combinatorics book which is well written (details of combinatorial arguments are spelled out clearly one step at a time). Lastly, how should I study combinatorics? For example, drawing out pictures is always helpful, but when should I enumerate, look for inductive patterns and what should I do when I am stuck? I feel like I waste time looking for silly patterns rather than stepping back and looking at the big picture. Sometimes, I have trouble finding the big picture, but once I see it, then the problem is easy. Combinatorics seems to be more of a problem-solving field than a deep theory, how does this impact study? All comments and advice are welcome. I am hoping to learn from your experiences so I can become a better mathematician.","['self-learning', 'learning', 'combinatorics']"

From seeing a friend solve a question similar to this, I noticed that the top portion of the equation equalled to the total amount of technicians and chemists e.g. $26$. Therefore, the top part has to always add up to 26. Since the you can only select $5$ people in the committee, the bottom portion has to add up to $5$.

316382,Would this still hold true if the probabilities of A and B followed a normal distribution?,"Part a)
Let A be the number that the left-hand die shows. Let B be the number that the right-hand
die shows.
Both dice are fair and therefore the probability that B is greater than A is equal to the probability that B is less than A (i.e. P(B > A) = P(B < A)). Furthermore, all possibilities can be summarized by B > A, B < A, and B = A. Therefore P(B > A) + P(B < A) + P(A = B) = 1 Note that P(A = B) is 1/6 because whatever number B shows, A will show the same number
one out of six times. Therefore equation 1 becomes: P(B > A) + P(B < A) + 1/6 = 1 Since P(B > A) = P(B < A), we can arrive at our solution with: 2P(B > A) = 1 − 1/6 = 5/6 Therefore P(B > A) = 5/12 The probability that the right-hand die shows a larger number than the left-hand die is 5/12 Part b) Given that the left hand die is rolled first and it shows 5 (i.e. A = 5). What is P(B >

Proof : Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be irreducible of prime degree $p$. Let $E/F$ be a finite extension. By Proposition 20 there exists a field $L$ containing $F$ with $[L:F] = p$ in which $f(x)$ has a root $\alpha$. If $E \subseteq L$ then we can consider $p = [L : F] = [L : E][E : F]$. It must follow that $[E:F] = p$ since if $[L:E] = p$, then $[E:F]=1$ which would contradict $f(x)$ being irreducible in $F$. Hence $[E:F] = p$ and immediately $p \mid [E:F]$. Now if $L \subseteq E$ then we consider $[E:F] = [E:L][L:F] = [E:L]p$ and thus $p \mid [E:F]$. Proposition 20: Let $F$ be a field. Let $p(x) \in F[x]$ be irreducible of degree $n$.

316697,Alternative proof of Monotone Convergence Theorem,"Let $(X, \mathfrak{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space. Show that the Monotone Convergence Theorem holds if $f$, $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$, ... are real-valued measurable functions and $f_{1}$ is integrable. Further, (1) $f_{1} \leq f_{2}...$ and (2) f = $\lim_{n} f_{n}$ hold almost everywhere. My try:
Assume (1) and (2) hold everywhere.
From the monotonicity of the integral we have $\int f_{1} d\mu \leq \int f_{2} d\mu \leq$ .. $\leq \int f d\mu$. We need to show the reverse inequality. Let $g^{+}_{n,k}$  and $g^{-}_{n,k}$ be two sequences of positive valued simple functions such that $\lim_{k} g^{+}_{n,k} - g^{-}_{n,k} = f_{n}$ and $g^{+}_{n,k} - g^{-}_{n,k} \leq f_{n}$ for all $k$. Define $h_{n}^{+}$ and $h_{n}^{-}$ as $h^{+}_{n} = \max_{k}(g_{k,n}^{+}$) and $h^{-}_{n} = \max_{k}(-g^{-}_{k,n})$, then both $h_{n}^{+}$ and $h^{-}_{n}$ are non-decreasing measurable simple functions and $\lim_{n} h^{+}_{n} + h^{-}_{n } = f^{+} - f^{-} = f$. Also $h^{+}_{n} \leq f^{+}_{n}$ and $h^{-}_{n} \leq -f^{-}_{n}.$ Since $h^{+}_{n}$ and $h^{-}_{n}$ are simple functions, it follows $\lim_n \int h_{n}^{+} d\mu = \int f^{+} d\mu$ and $ \lim_{n} \int h^{-}_{n} d\mu = -\int f^{-} d\mu$ and
$\lim_{n} \int h^{+}_{n} + h^{-}_{n} d\mu = \int f d\mu$. Since $\int f^{+} d\mu = \lim_{n} h^{+}_{n} d\mu \leq \lim_{n} \int f^{+}_{n}d\mu$ and similary $-\int f^{-}d\mu = \lim_{n} \int h^{-}_{n} d\mu \leq \lim_{n} -\int f^{-}_{n}d\mu$ $\int f d\mu = \lim_{n} \int h^{+}_{n} + h^{-}_{n} d\mu \leq \lim_{n} \int f^{+}_{n} - f^{-}_{n} d\mu = \int f_{n}d\mu$. Assume now (1) and (2) hold almost everywhere, let $N$ be the set consisting all $x\in X$ for which at least one of (1) and (2) fails. Then the functions $f\chi_{n^{C}}$ and $f_{n}\chi_{N^{C}}$ fulfills (1) and (2) and thus $\int f\chi_{N^{C}} d\mu = \lim_{n} \int f_{n}\chi_{N^{C}}d\mu$ and from this we can conclude that $\int f d\mu = \lim_{n} \int f_{n}d\mu$. This is very similar to a proof for MCT in the book Measure Theory by Donald Cohn, however, the book is for positive valued functions only. My question is whether this is correct or if I have missed something. Secondly, why is the constraint that $f_{1}$ is integrable necessary?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

316731,'Galois Resolvent' and elementary symmetric polynomials in a paper by Noether,"In Emmy Noether's 1915 paper ""Der Endlichkeitssatz der Invarianten endlicher Gruppen"", I saw the notion of a 'Galois resolvent', which I don't quite understand. Google didn't really help me with that, since it seems to be different from what I have found to this notion. Let me try to translate what happens there: We have a finite group $H$ of invertible $n\times n$-matrices $A_1,\dots,A_h$, where $A_k=(a_{ij}^{(k)})$, with entries in some field $K$ of characteristic $0$ (I'm actually not 100% sure if this is sufficient, in a later paper she talks about 'übliche Zahlkörper'). Then $H$ acts on the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, where we set $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^T$, via $$(A_k,x)\mapsto A_k\cdot x,$$ and we denote $A_k\cdot x$ also by $x^{(k)}$. Since one of the $A_k$ is the identity, there is a $k$ such that $x^{(k)}=x$. Now a polynomial invariant of $G$ is some $f\in K[x_1,...,x_n]$ for which $A_k\cdot f=f$ for all $k$. In other words, we have $$f(x)=f(x^{(1)})=\dots=f(x^{(h)})=\frac{1}{h}\sum_{k=1}^hf(x^{(k)}).$$ Now comes the part where I'm stuck, I try to translate it as good as I can: This formula expresses that $f$ is a a polynomial, symmetric function in the $x^{(k)}$. The theorem about symmetric functions of ""Größenreihen"" (I don't know how to translate this) says that $f$ can be represented in a polynomial way by the elementary symmetric functions of these ""Reihen"" (series), that is, by the coefficients $G_{\alpha,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n}(x)$ of the ""Galois resolvent"": \begin{align*}\phi(z,u)&=\prod_{k=1}^h(z+u_1x_1^{(k)}+\dots+u_nx_n^{(k)})\\&=z^h+\sum G_{\alpha,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n}(x)z^\alpha u_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots u_n^{\alpha_n}\begin{pmatrix}(\alpha+\alpha_1+\dots+\alpha_n=h)\\\alpha\neq h\end{pmatrix},\end{align*} where the $G_{\alpha,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n}(x)$ are invariants of degree $\alpha_1+\dots+\alpha_n$ in the $x_i$. I actually don't have any idea where $u,z$ come from. I thought there was a nice expression for the elementary symmetric polynomials, and that they are coefficients of a much simpler polynomial. The theorem mentioned above isn't referenced further, I guess the main theorem on symmetric polynomials is meant, but I fail to get the connection to this strange formula. I'd be glad if someone could help me out here, and explain where this 'Galois resolvent' comes from and what's the connection to the 'usual' stuff about symmetric polynomials.

316849,Intersection of conics using matrix representation [closed],"Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 7 years ago . Improve this question I came across a very interesting section of a wikipedia article on conics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section#Intersecting_two_conics I am trying to work out a couple of examples to add to the page. Example 1 - (this one turns out to be quite straight forward - see Example 2 below for a more general case): Take these two hyperbolas, Q1 and Q2:
Q1: 
$$x^2 - y^2 - 2 = 0$$
and Q2: 
$$.5x^2 - y^2 - 1 = 0$$ Their graphs which show that they have 2 real intersections are here: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%28x^2+-+y^2+-+2+%3D+0+and+.5x^2+-+y^2+-+1+%3D+0%29 First, we construct their matrices:
$$Q_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & -1 & 0\\0 & 0 & -2\end{bmatrix}$$
$$Q_2 = \begin{bmatrix}1/2 & 0 & 0\\0 & -1 & 0\\0 & 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}$$ Then, we set $$det(\lambda Q_1 + \mu Q_2) = 0.$$ Expanding this determinant, we get the equation:
$$(\lambda + \frac{\mu}{2})(-\lambda-\mu)(-2\lambda-\mu) = 0$$ Here, each of the 3 factors can be independently set equal to zero to find the 3 solutions:
$$\mu = -2\lambda,$$
$$\mu = -\lambda,$$ and
$$\mu = -2\lambda,$$ respectively. Alternatively, we could immediately set $\lambda=1$ and solve $\mu^3/2+(5 \mu^2)/2+4 \mu+2$ algorithmically. There three degenerate conics? I.e. if we take one of the solutions ($\mu = -\lambda$), and use it to compute a particular linear combination (plugging into the linear combination equation $\lambda C_1 + \mu C_2$), we get: $$\lambda C_1 -\lambda C_2$$ which is still an expression with an unknown? Does it mean we can choose any $\lambda$ to obtain a degenerate conic? That is, set $\lambda=1$ to get: $$C_0 = \begin{bmatrix}.5 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}$$ Now we identify two coincident lines constituting this degenerate conic. We set $x^T C_0 x$ equal to zero, and we get
$$.5x^2 - 1=0.$$
We see that
$$x=\pm \sqrt{2}$$
(a pair of vertical lines). Intersecting these lines with the conics will give the intersection points of the original conics. Here, since the lines are vertical we can simply substitute the values
$$x=\sqrt{2}$$
and
$$x=-\sqrt{2}$$ to
obtain the intersections (there are only 2 in this problem, but there can be up to 4): From Q_1:
$$(\sqrt{2})^2 - y^2 - 2 = 0 \rightarrow y=0$$
$$(-\sqrt{2})^2 - y^2 - 2 = 0 \rightarrow y=0$$ we get intersection points
$$(\sqrt{2}, 0)$$
and
$$(-\sqrt{2},0).$$ From Q_2: 
$$.5(\sqrt{2})^2 - y^2 - 1 = 0 \rightarrow y=0$$
$$.5(-\sqrt{2})^2 - y^2 - 1 = 0 \rightarrow y=0$$ we get intersection points
$$(\sqrt{2}, 0)$$
and
$$(-\sqrt{2},0).$$ Example #2 Take these two hyperbolas, Q1 and Q2:
Q1: 
$$.5x^2 - y^2 + .1xy + 1 = 0$$
and Q2: 
$$-x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 0$$ Their graphs which show that they have 4 real intersections are here: First, we construct their matrices:
$$Q_1 = \begin{bmatrix}.5 & .05 & 0\\.05 & -1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
$$Q_2 = \begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$ Then, we set $$det(\lambda Q_1 + \mu Q_2) = 0.$$ Expanding this determinant, we get the equation:
$$-.5\lambda^3 + \lambda^2\mu +.5\lambda\mu^2-\mu^3 - .0025\lambda^3 - .0025\lambda^2\mu.$$ Arbitrarily setting $\lambda=1$ and expanding, we get the equation $$-\mu^3+.5\mu^2+.9975\mu-.5025=0.$$ The 3 (approximate) solutions are:
$$\mu = -1,$$
$$\mu = .505,$$
and
$$\mu = .99495,$$
respectively. Going back and constructing the degenerate conic matrix (with $\lambda=1$ and $\mu=-1$), we have (Can you just pick one of the 3 solutions that comes from the determinant equation as I did?) $$C_0 = \begin{bmatrix}1.5 & .05 & 0\\.05 & -2 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ Now
$$x^T C_0 x = 0 = $$
we get
$$1.5x^2 + .1xy-2y^2 = 0.$$ Solving for $y$, we see that the two lines are
$$y=−0.841386x$$
and
$$y=0.891386x.$$ These lines intersect the conics at exactly the intersection points of the conics, as seen here: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%28.5x^2-y^2%2B.1xy%2B1%3D0+and+-x^2%2By^2%2B1%3D0+and+y+%3D+%E2%88%920.841386x+and+y%3D0.891386x%29 The intersection points can be found by substituting the equation of both lines in to the equation of both conics. For example, substituting $$y=−0.841386x$$
into
$$.5x^2 - y^2 + .1xy + 1 = 0$$
we get
$$x=1.8505$$
Plugging this into the equation of the line $y=−0.841386x$, we see that one intersection point is $(1.8505, -1.5569)$. The other 3 intersection points can be found identically.","['matrices', 'conic-sections']"
316852,Geodesics on a 2-sphere,"I've been doing some work where I need to find the geodesics in a given Riemannian Manifold. Let's take the example of the two sphere, for simplicity, with unitary radius. The distance between two points, say: $p$ and $q$, is given by the length of the geodesic that connect those two points, such that:
$$d=\int_0^1 [\dot{\theta}^2+\sin^2(\theta)\dot{\phi}^2]^{1/2}dt,$$
where $c(t)=(\theta (t),\phi(t))$ is the geodesic that connect the two considered points (i.e.  $c(0)=p$ and $c(1)=q$). To find the expression of the geodesic one uses the Variational Principle, which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations for $\theta$ and $\phi$. To simplify our work one can, instead of searching for the curve that minimizes the distance, search for the curve that minimizes the Energy functional and it can be proven that if the curve is a geodesic then the curve that minimizes the energy is the same as the curve that minimizes the distance (proof in the previous link). Using what I've stated to search for the geodesics on the 2-sphere we find two differential equations which admit solutions to be the great circles or the meridians. Now to the actual question(s): If instead of parametrizing the geodesic with the parameter $t$ one parametrizes it with the coordinate $\theta$ (knowing that one can no longer describe the geodesics that connect two points with the same $\theta$ coordinate), such that $c(\theta)=(\theta,\phi(\theta))$ and $\dot{c}=(1,\dot{\phi})$, is the curve that minimizes the distance the same that minimizes the energy? If the answer is yes one finds that: $\phi(\theta)=\frac{\phi_2}{\cot(\theta_2)}\cot(\theta)$, assuming the first point's coordinates to be $(\pi/2,0)$ and $(\theta_2,\phi_2)$ for the second point. But that leads to a wierd behaviour for points near the poles and $\phi_2>\pi$... (see picture) What am I doing wrong?It's the answer to the first question, the coordinate system or something deeper...?","['spherical-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partial  \mathbf{v}} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{x} + h \mathbf{v})-f(\mathbf{x})}{h}.
\end{equation} Can you rigorously explain the transition from first and second definition? Thanks! Edit: Just to make it clear. The first definition is primarily wrong because the orientation of the directional vector is not fixed. So if I correct it like this (switching to conventional notation) \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}} f(\mathbf{x}) = \lim_{||\mathbf{v}|| \to 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{x} + ||\mathbf{v}||\mathbf{\hat{v}})-f(\mathbf{x})}{||\mathbf{v}||},
\end{equation} it makes a little bit more sense ($ \mathbf{\hat{v}}$ denotes unit vector). BUT the norm allows to get close to zero just from right side ($ ||\mathbf{v}|| \to 0+ $) and the limit makes sense even for vector reversal (~ negative norm). So we can actually use any scalar $h$ scaling the vector and write the derivative as \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}} f(\mathbf{x}) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{x} + h\mathbf{\hat{v}})-f(\mathbf{x})}{h}

317064,Does Cauchy sequence of disjoint and closed subsets converge to a non-empty set in a Banach space?,"Suppose, $X$ is a banach space. For any $x,y \in X$ , we define $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ , For any $A, B \subseteq X$ , we define: $$d(A, B) = \inf_{x \in A, y\in B}{d(x,y)}$$ Say, $(K_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence of disjoint and closed subsets of $X$ . We say that: $$K = \{x \in X: \lim_{n \to \infty}d(\{x\}, K_n) = 0\}$$ is the limit of $(K_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ . Is $K$ necessarily non-empty? Added : Thank you all for your examples and corrections. My naive attempt is to find a condition stronger than sequential completeness. I hope it will work by adding ""disjoint and closed"".",['sequences-and-series']
317065,Question on determinants of matrices changing between integer matrices [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Index of a sublattice in a lattice and a homomorphism between them (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . The following problem came up from a though I had while reading: Let's say we have $M=\mathbb{Z}^n$ and we have another free $\mathbb{Z}$-module, $N$, inside of $M$ also with rank $n$. We know we can make a matrix $A$ that changes $N$ to its representation in $M$ (ie has as columns the basis $N$ expressed in coordinates coming from the basis of $M$). If the index of $N$ in $M$ is $m$, I am pretty sure just from tinkering that the determinant of $A$ should also be $m$, however, I have not been able to show this. It is unclear to me how to proceed. I though maybe I could do something related to the points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ that are within the unit box of $N$, but I cannot really make sense of this. Thank you for any help or direction.","['linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'determinant']"
