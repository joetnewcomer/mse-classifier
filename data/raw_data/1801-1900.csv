12621,Unit Normal Field on a 2D manifold embedded in R^3,"Let us assume that we are given a closed, orientable 2D manifold embedded in $R^3$, and lets call it $M$. I think it is clear that in a coordinate neighborhood $(U, \phi)$ it is possible to at each point define a unit normal vector $N_p$ by looking at the tangent space $T_pM$ as a subspace of $T_pR^3$ and considering the 1D vector space $T_pM^\perp$. However, there are always two choices of $N_p$. Intuitively, an orientation should should define $N_p$ uniquely, but I am not sure how to use that $M$ is oriented to do this. If we have an orientation 2-form $\Omega$ on $M$, how can we use this to figure out which of the two possible $N_p$'s is correct? Furthermore, since we have $N_p$ defined at each point in $U$, we have a vector field on $U$. I was not sure how to show that this is a smooth vector field, but I believe that once you've done this, you can somehow use a partition of unity to extend $N$ to the entire manifold. But, I think that there is some subtlety even to this. I mean, for a non-orientable manifold such as a Möbius strip, it seems to me that you can define locally a smooth unit-normal vector field, but when you try to extend it to the whole manifold it is no longer a continuous vector field, so somehow the orientation must play a role in the extension, and I am not sure how.","['general-topology', 'calculus', 'differential-geometry']"

12635,"If G is fully residually cyclic, does G have at most one subgroup of each finite index?","Update: Steve points out in comments that many direct products of residually cyclic groups will be counterexamples.  Indeed, I should have spotted this: every finitely generated abelian group is residually cyclic!  I should have asked about fully residually cyclic groups, ie groups $G$ such that for any finite subset $X\subseteq G\smallsetminus 1$, there is a homomorphism from $G$ to a cyclic group that doesn't kill any elements of $X$.  I suspect the question is now quite easy, though I haven't had a chance to think about it yet. This question is motivated by this recent question , which asked for a characterisation of groups with at most one subgroup of each finite index.  Arturo Magidin's answer showed that every such finite group is cyclic, but the questioner, Louis Burkill, added in comments that he is really interested in the infinite case. In my answer to that question, I argue that a finitely generated group has at most one subgroup of each finite index if and only if its canonical residually finite quotient, $R(G)$, is cyclic. The `finitely generated' hypothesis is necessary - otherwise the additive group of the rationals provides a counterexample. In the general case, one can reduce from the case of $G$ to $R(G)$ as before (this gets rid of pathological examples like infinite simple groups), and the same argument shows that if $R(G)$ has at most one subgroup of each finite index then $R(G)$ is fully residually cyclic, in particular abelian.  But the converse is not clear to me.  Hence the question in the title, which I'll reiterate here, with some extra hypotheses that should indicate where the difficulty lies. If $G$ is an infinitely generated, fully residually cyclic (in particular, abelian) group, must $G$ have at most one subgroup of each finite index?",['group-theory']

12639,Understanding Limits of Integration in Integration-by-Parts,"My understanding of integration-by-parts is a little shaky.

12644,Is $\mathbb{C}^*$ modulo the roots of unity isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^+$?,"A student came to me showing a question from his exam in basic group theory, in which they are asked to prove that $\mathbb{C}^*$ modulo the subgroup of roots of unity is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^+$ (in both cases we mean the multiplicative groups). Now this seems to me to be a simple error in the question. I believe they meant to ask to prove that $\mathbb{C}^*$ modulo all the elements of absolute value 1 is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^+$ which is very easy to prove (take the homomorphism mapping $z$ to $|z|$ and use the first homomorphism theorem). However, I couldn't prove the claim about the roots of unity is wrong; is there an easy way to show this?","['examples-counterexamples', 'complex-numbers', 'group-theory']"

12648,knapsack algorithm that looks too good to be true,"I have an idea for solving the knapsack problem, but it looks too good to be true. I would like someone to explain potential problems with this approach. I'll give an example: I want to find a subset of {2,7,11} which has elements that sum to 13. Here is the algorithm for solving this: In binary notation 2=0010, 7=0111, 11=1011, 13=1101. Suppose that 2x+7y+11z=13, where x,y,z are {0,1}. Then y+z=1 (mod 2), since the last bits of 7, 11, and 13 are 1 and the last bit of 2 is 0. And (y+z-1)+2*(x+y+z)=0 (mod 4), since the second to last bits of 2, 7, and 11 are 1 and the second to last bit of 13 is 0. (The y+z-1 is the carry bit from before.) And ((y+z-1)+2*(x+y+z)-0)+4y=4 (mod 8), since the third to last bits of 7 and 13 are 1 and the third to last bit of 2 and 11 are 0. (The (y+z-1)+2*(x+y+z)-0 is the carry bit from before.) And finally ((y+z-1)+2*(x+y+z)-0)+4y-4)+8z=8 (mod 16), since the first bits of 11 and 13 are 1 and the first bit of 2 and 7 are 0. (The ((y+z-1)+2*(x+y+z)-0)+4y-4 is the carry bit from before.) So we have four linear equations over a finite ring, if we change each one to mod 16. 8y+8z=8 (mod 16) 8x+12y+12z=4 (mod 16) 4x+14y+6z=10 (mod 16) 2x+7y+11z=13 (mod 16) As we can see, a solution is x=1, y=0, z=1, as one would expect, since the set {2,11} has elements that sum to 13. We could have gotten this through Gaussian elimination (according to answers to my last question on this site). By request, here is the general algorithm that I just wrote (which can be induced from the above example): We want to solve a_1*x_1 + ... a_n*x_n = b, where each a_j and b is an integer and each x_j is in {0,1}. Putting each a_j and b in binary, we have a_j=(a_{mj} ... a_{1j}) and b=(b_m ... b_1), for suitable m. For instance, a_j=5 in binary is (a_{4j} ... a_{1j})=(0 1 0 1) - highest bit on the left side, lowest on the right side. Here is the simple algorithm for constructing a new matrix A=(a_{ij}) from this original (a_{ij}) and a new b=(b_i) from this original b: `Let b_1 = 2^{m-1}*b_1;
For j=1 to n 
 Let a_{1j} = 2^{m-1}*a_{1j}; For i=2 to m {
 Let b_i = 2^{m-1}*b_i + b_{i-1}/2;
 For j=1 to n
  Let a_{ij} = 2^{m-1}*a_{ij} + a_{(i-1),j}/2;
}` Next solve the matrix equation Ax=b (mod 2^m), for the new A=(a_{ij}) and b=(b_i). If there is a solution to the knapsack problem, there should be a solution for x in {0,1} in Ax=b (mod 2^m) and vice versa (since the last row is just the original a_j and b). I'm curious to see if it works for large m and n. Anyone want to give it a shot? What's wrong with this approach? It shouldn't work, but I don't know why.","['linear-algebra', 'computer-science', 'algorithms']"
12655,Soft Question Hilbert Space Geometry,"Just a quick question about the geometry of Hilbert spaces from an intuitive standpoint.  Maybe just assuming we're working with $L^2$ would simplify the situation. Basically, in something like $\mathbb{R}^2$ we have the situation that $\cos(\theta)=\frac{\langle a,b\rangle}{\vert a\vert\cdot\vert b\vert}$, and the idea of an angle between vectors is very meaningful, geometrically.  We can easily extend this idea to $\mathbb{R}^n$ because when we talk about the angle between two vectors, we mean we are choosing the plane that both of them lie in, and picking the vector in there.  But what does this really mean in a Hilbert space like $L^2$? I have a good intuition about functions, and about geometry (topology) separately, but not really the ""geometry of functions"". Now, there may be no visualization of this in $L^2$, and I'm not asking for one, but is there any sense to doing geometry (i.e. actual polygons, things like that) in a space like $L^2$?  Also, what sort of applications do ideas like this have in functional analysis?  Are we ever interested in ideas like ""planes"" of functions, polygons, surfaces, solids, etc.? What do we really mean by angles, projections, normal vectors?  And do these sorts of things ever have any sort of interesting relationships? I'm primarily asking for an intuitive idea here.  It's easy to just do the math, prove theorems about inner products, norms, etc. Maybe geometry gives some clues or intuitive ideas when doing functional analysis?","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'soft-question']"
12657,Finding the least element of the greatest elements of certain subsets of the natural numbers,"This is a problem that a professor proposed for the highschool mathematical olympiad in Costa Rica that we haven't been able to solve. Therefore it cannot be asked since we don't have a solution yet in general. Let $\mathcal{F}_{k}$ for a fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$   be the family of subsets $A_i \subset \mathbb{N}$ that satisfy the following conditions: 1) The cardinality of $A_i$ is $k$ for every  index $i$. 2) For every $A_i$ it holds that given any two different subsets of two elements $ \{ x, y \} \neq \{ z, w \}$, the absolute value of the differences between the elements of each subset are different $$ |x - y| \neq |z - w|$$ Now we define a function $f: \mathcal{F}_k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ given by $$f(A_i) =  \max{A_i}$$ The problem is to find the minimum of the image of $f$, that is to find $$\min{f(\mathcal{F}_k)}$$ For instance, we know that for $k = 4$ the answer is $\min{f(\mathcal{F}_4)} = 7$ and for $k = 3 $ the answer is $\min{f(\mathcal{F}_3)} = 4$ but we don't have a general pattern for the solution, basically these were done by ""brute force"".

12662,Proving or disproving statements related to convergent and absolutely convergent series,"Prove or disprove: Let $\rho : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ injective.

(ii) If $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_{n}$ converges then $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_{\rho(n)}$ also converges. So my understanding is that a series converges if the infinite sum of the series is the limit? It converges absolutely if $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty |a_{n}|$ converges. The way I am reading the $a_{\rho(n)}$ 's is that they denote some sort of permutation or rearrangement of the original series. Aside from that though, I am absolutely lost when it comes to approaching this problem... In general am I looking for an $\epsilon >0$ which is greater than $a_{\rho(1)}+ \dots +a_{\rho(n)}$ ?

12664,"These two group theory statements are ""the same""?","Let $G$ be a group and $G'$ its commutator subgroup. Let $\pi: G\to G/G'$ be the natural projection.

Statement 2: If $\varphi:G\to A$ is any homomorphism of $G$ into an Abelian group $A$, then $\varphi$ factors through $G'$; i.e., $G'\le \ker{\varphi}$ and there is a homomorphism $\hat{\varphi}:G/G'\to A$ such that $\varphi(g) = (\hat{\varphi}\circ \pi)(g)$.

12689,Probability on spreading of rumors,"A little help here.

Find the probability that the rumor will be told $r$ times without: a) returning to the originator, b) being repeated to any person. Do the same problem when at each step the rumor is told by one person to a gathering of $N$ randomly chosen people. (The first question is the special case N=1). I already did a) and b) for the first description of the problem and a) for the case when the rumor is spreading through a gathering of $N$ people, however, my solution for b) in this second case is not correct. I reasoned in the following way: In a first instance, $n$ people to receive the rumor, however, it's needed to spread such rumor through a group of $N$ people, therefore, there are $\displaystyle n \choose N$ ways to choose those gatherings. Once one of these people is chosen, he/she can choose from another gathering of $N$ people, taking care of not choosing someone who already know the rumor, which is, there are $\displaystyle n-1 \choose N$, and so on, until we reach the $r$ step in this process. Therefore, the probability I get is: $$\frac{\displaystyle {n \choose N} {n-1 \choose N} {n-2 \choose N} ... {n-r+1 \choose N}}{\displaystyle {n \choose N}^{r}}$$ According to the book, the solution must be $\displaystyle \frac{(n)_{Nr}}{(n_{N})^{r}}$ (which is not equivalent to the first expression).

12728,"Equation of plane passing containing the intersection of other two planes, with a fixed distance to the origin.","Hello all this is my first math question, I hope this is the right place to post.
Anyway, this is basic stuff but I'm a bit confused here, here's the problem's legend:
""Find the equation of the plane that passes through the intersection line ($l$) of the planes $2x-y-z=2, x+y-3z+4=0$ and has a distance of 2 from the origin. Ok, So here's what I've done, the family of planes that pases through $l$ is $$2x-y-z-2+k(x+y-3z+4)=0$$ We work the equation so it looks more like a planes general form: $$Ax+By+Cz+D=0$$ giving us this:$$(2+k)x+(k-1)y+(-3k-1)z +2(2k-1)=$$
where$$A=(2+k)$$ $$B=(k-1)$$ $$C=(-1-3k)$$ $$D=2(2k-1)$$ The problem states that it's distance to the origin is 2 and the normal form of a plane($x\cos{\alpha}+y\cos{\beta}+z\cos{\gamma}-p=0$) where $p$ is the distance of the plane to the origin. We know that to transform a planes equation from the general form to the normal form we must divide each term by $$r=\pm \sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}$$
So $p=\frac{D}{r}$ and we have this:$$2=\frac{2(2k-1)}{\pm \sqrt{(2+k)^2+(k-1)^2+(-1-3k)^2}}$$
And here is where my doubt is, what sign should $r$ have positive or negative, the following theorem says: if $D \neq 0$, $r$ is opposite sign of $D$ if $D=0$ and $C \neq 0$ $r$ is equal sign of $C$ if $D=0$ and $C=0$ and $B \neq 0$ $r$ is equal sign of $B$ if $D=0$ and $C=0$ and $B=0$ and $A \neq 0$ $r$ is equal sign of $A$ Since we don't know the value of k and $D(k)=2(2k-1)$ and to have $D$ we must find k but k is determined by the sign of D(what a mess hehe) how do we chose $r$'s sign?

12960,Involution centralizer of perfect group with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups,"Exercise 7.11 of  Kurzweil–Stellmacher asks me to: Prove that the centralizer of an involution is nonsolvable inside any perfect group with generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups of order at least 16. I would like to oblige, but I'm having trouble getting much of a handle on the centralizer itself, rather than just its action. The center T=⟨t⟩ of a quaternion group is weakly closed, and so the normalizer X=N G (T)=C G (t) of T in that perfect group G controls G-fusion within any Sylow 2-subgroup P that happens to contain T. The only fusion possible on P in a perfect group is the ""full"" fusion where all (both classes of) quaternion subgroups of order 8 are acted on by their full automorphism group (and otherwise no fusion beyond that induced by P itself). So I know X contains at least two copies of SL(2,3) and X/Z contains at least two copies of S4.  Since G is perfect, P = [P,X] ≤ [X,X].  I think the copies of SL(2,3) pairwise intersect in a particular cyclic subgroup of P of order 4. More precisely: If Q is a quaternion subgroup of P of order 8, then Y=N X (Q) contains SL(2,3) and Y/Z contains S4.  [Y,Q] ≥ Q.  P is generated by its [T:Q] quaternion subgroups of order 8, so also by its [Y,Q]s.  The intersection of any pair of distinct Qs is the order 4 cyclic subgroup of the (unique) maximal subgroup that happens to be cyclic. So it is a special configuration that has to fit lots of solvable groups inside, but I don't see any particular reason the result could not be solvable.  The closest thing to nonsolvable I get is that the derived length of N has to be at least 3. I get roughly the same results for a quaternion Sylow of order 8, except one only has the single SL(2,3).  I have not found a perfect G with solvable X in this case, but of course I can if I only require the same fusion pattern, since SL(2,3) and SL(2,5) have the same 2-fusion. More: With a little reminder from reading the work of Bender's students, I can now do this using Brauer–Suzuki or Z*, but this does not seem much like a homework solution. The truth seems to be X⋅O(G)=G, and every non-trivial quotient of a perfect group is perfect, so the homomorphic image G/O(G) of X is perfect.  Since G has Sylow 2-subgroups, G/O(G) is non-identity, so X has a non-identity perfect quotient, so X is nonsolvable. I'm not sure how to show X⋅O(G)=G without using tools significantly beyond chapter 7. Smaller question: I vaguely recall Suzuki proved that if G is a perfect group with no non-identity normal subgroups of odd order and with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups, then each coset of C G (t) contains exactly one conjugate of t, where t is an involution.  In other words, if the product of two involutions centralizes t, then that product is the identity. Can someone prove this with ideas from K–S up to chapter 7? This is hard for me to check since in reality such a group has exactly one involution t and G = C G (t), but that comes later in my solution.",['group-theory']

It seems that what appeared to be possibly simpler is actually not, with current techniques. The main motivation for asking about this particular number is that it is very large. It is certainly possible to find a pair of very large numbers, at least one of which is transcendental.

13091,Analytic Geometry | Two Planes and a Angle | Two Solutions,"This is me again, I have another problem which I haven't been able to solve, the 
legend goes like this: Find the equation of the plane that contains the points $P_1(1,0,-1)$, $P_2(2,0,2)$ and forms a 60 0 ($\theta$) angle with the other plane $2x-2y+z+6=0$ (Two Solutions). Here's what I've done: Since we already know two points, P 1 $(1, 0, -1)$ and P 2 $(2,0,2)$ they both satisfy a planes equation: $$Ax+By+Cz+D=0$$
So, we substitute $x,y,z$ respectively for each point, giving use these two equations $A(1)+B(0)+C(-1)+D=0$ $A(2)+B(0)+C(2)+D=0$ Simplifying we get: $A-C+D=0$ $2A+2C+D=0$ Now, according to the following theorem the angle that is formed by the perpendiculars of to planes is the following: $$\cos{\theta} = \pm \frac{AA'+BB'+CC'}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2} \sqrt{(A')^2+(B')^2+(C')^2}}$$ Where $[A,B,C]$ Are the director numbers of the normal in the first plane and $[A',B',C']$ Are the director numbers of the normal in the second plane. Now, given those and taking the known angle of 60 o , we substitute the director numbers of $2x-2y+z+6-0:[A'=2,B'=-2,C'=1]$ and the angle in the last formula, giving us:
$$\cos{60^\circ} = \pm \frac{A(2)-B(-2)+C(1)}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2} \sqrt{(2)^2+(-2)^2+(1)^2}}$$ Simplifying, we get(positive because $\theta$ is acute):
$$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2A-2B+C}{3 \sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}$$ Another simplification finally for:
$$3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$$
Now, we have 3 equations: $A-C+D=0$ $2A+2C+D=0$ $3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$ If we take 1) and 2) and write them as $D(A,C)$ we get: $D=C-A$ $D=-2A-2C$ From which we can obtain A in terms of C
$$-2A-2C=C-A$$
$$A=-3C$$
Now we substitute back in 1):
$$(-3C)-C+D=0$$
$$C=\frac{1}{4}D$$
Since I want every director number in terms of D we substitute again but in A since A was in function of C.
$$A=-3C$$
$$A=-3(\frac{1}{4}D)$$
$$A=\frac{-3}{4}D$$ Now, we have found $A(D)$, $C(D)$ we have yet to find $B(D)$ I'll explain why I think and want everything in terms of D, if we take the general form of a planes equation $Ax+By+Cz+D=0$ and substitute $A$ and $C$ with our known values we get:
$$(\frac{-3}{4}D)x+By+(\frac{1}{4}D)z+D=0$$
if we divide by $D \neq 0$ and then multiply by 4 to eliminate fractions:
$$\frac{-3}{4}x+\frac{B}{D}y+\frac{1}{4}z+1=0$$
$$-3x+\frac{4B}{D}y+z+4=0$$
From here it's clear that if we find B in terms of D and B is linear we have the planes equation, so, in 3) $3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$ we substitute A and C:
$$3((\frac{-3}{4}D)^2+B^2+(\frac{1}{4}D)^2)=(4(\frac{-3}{4})-4B+2(\frac{1}{4}D))^2$$
$$\vdots$$
$$104B^2+80DB+35D^2=0$$ Here is were I get stuck, I get imaginary parts, since I have to use the quadratic formula, so any help is really appreciated, the problem states that there are two solutions, but this is what I have thought of if anyone can supply any solution I'll be very grateful.

Two cases seem basic and approachable but already very interesting: $R=\mathbb{Z}_2$, the $2$-adic integers, and $R/I$ = $\mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$ with $n$ varying, and $R=\mathbb{F}_2[[x]]$, the power series over the field with $2$ elements, and $R/I = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(2,x^n)$ with $n$ varying. In each case $G = \operatorname{SL}(2,R/I)$ is finite and solvable, with $G/O_2(G) ≅ \operatorname{SL}(2,2) ≅ S_3$ being a nice familiar group.  In other words, nothing radically strange can happen in any one particular group. However, I am having quite a bit of trouble understanding how the subgroups vary with $n$.  Call the first sequence of groups $G(2,n)$ and the second sequence of groups $G(x,n)$. Which groups $G(2,n)$ and $G(x,n)$ contain $Q_8$, a quaternion group of order $8$? $Q_8$ seems to be contained in $G(x,2n+1)$ and not contained in $G(x,2n)$ or $G(x,1)$ or any $G(2,n)$. Which dihedral groups are contained in each $G(2,n)$ and $G(x,n)$? The $G(2,n+1)$ seem to be bereft of dihedrals, but $G(2,1)$ has one, and $G(x,n+1)$ seem to have the full crew.  Why does the ""$2$"" destroy dihedrals while the ""$x$"" invites more? On the abelian side: What is the $2$-rank (maximum $n$ such that $G$ contains the direct product of $n$ cyclic groups of order $2$) of each $G(2,n)$ and $G(x,n)$? Again the pattern seems a bit wobbly, especially if you count how many subgroups of each rank there are (these do not form monotonic sequences). Any answer to the bold question should be able to address the strange (conjectured) answers to the smaller questions, but I'm also just fine with some ad hoc answers to the small ones as these groups are currently a complete mystery.  I think larger primes (or residue fields) would help with the very restricted nature of the subgroups available for testing, but at the beginning $p=2$ seems to help.  More independent nilpotents has not struck me as counter-intuitive yet.  Also in my limited experiments, $\operatorname{GL}$ seems to be a lot less strange, but feel free to share observations about it as well.",['group-theory']

13155,"Why study ""curves"" instead of 1-manifolds?","In most undergraduate differential geometry courses -- I am thinking of do Carmo's ""Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces"" -- the topic of study is curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  However, the definition of ""curve"" and ""surface"" are usually presented in very different ways. A curve is defined simply as a differentiable map $\gamma\colon I \to \mathbb{R}^3$, where $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is an interval.  Of course, some authors prefer to define a curve as the image of such a map, and others require piecewise-differentiability, but the general concept is the same. On the other hand, surfaces are essentially defined as 2-manifolds. Similarly, in graduate courses on manifolds -- I am thinking of John Lee's ""Introduction to Smooth Manifolds"" -- one talks about curves $\gamma\colon I \to M$ in a manifold, and can do line integrals over such curves, but talks separately about embedded/immersed 1-dimensional submanifolds. My question, then, is: Why make (parametrized) curves the object of study rather than 1-manifolds? Earlier, I asked a question that was perhaps meant to hint at this one, though I didn't say so explicitly. Ultimately, I would simply like to say ""curves are 1-manifolds and surfaces are 2-manifolds,"" and am looking for reasons why this is correct/incorrect or at least a good/bad idea.

(why?) Intuitively, both properties seem to talk about how open covers can be removed of unnecessary elements and still work as a cover, under conditions where points are sufficiently close together. However, I cannot figure out a proof for the second statement. Because the cover may contain uncountably many sets, it is very hard to deal with. This question appears in ""Elements of Point Set Topology"" by John D. Baum as exercise 3.33. The question and related hint can be viewed here . Terminology used in this text: A T1 space is a topological space such that, if x is an element of the space, the set {x} is closed. A countably compact space is a space such that every infinite subset of the space has a limit point in the space.

Proof: Let $E_n = [0,1]\cap\{f\ge n\}$ , where $f$ is a noncontinuous solution $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ . A continuous solution of that functional equation is a line through the origin.

Let $A$ be a set of representatives from each equivalence class. Let $g:A\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a non-constant ""assignment of slopes"".

To put it roughly, a noncontinuous solution is a stack of lines through the origin. a) Is this description of a noncontinuous solution correct? No it's not! As TCL helped me realize, this construction does satisfy the desired functional equation only for $x$ and $y$ in the same equivalence class. I need to require something more from g. b) Why does the proof work? I fail to see why are the $E_n$ measurable, or why are they $\lambda$ -thick. They don't need to be measurable! In fact, the concept of thickness is introduced to get around measurability issues. Let's construct $f$ this way: let $H$ be an Hamel basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , and $a\in H$ . Let $g(x) = x$ for $x\in H \setminus \{a\}$ and $g(a) = 0$ . Let's extend this function to $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by linearity using the Hamel basis. Using this $f$ we have that $E_0 = [0,1]$ , $E_1 = \{1\}$ , which clearly isn't $\lambda$ -thick. Where's the flaw? The flaw is that $E_1 \ne \{1\}$ because... Hamel bases don't work that way :)

$$ \Big(3 + \mathbf{K}_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{(\sqrt{a_{i-1}}+2)^2}{6}\Big)^{e} = (-1)^{-i} ,$$ In which $a_1=1^2,a_2=3^2$. We could re-state this equality by writing $e, -1$ and the root the latter as 
continued fractions, but I think the question is quite clear without doing so (also: other GCF's of pi ). What information about (generalized) continued fractions and calculating with them can we extract from Euler's identity? Motivation: I was hoping that, if we could find a good explanation for this, we would have more insight in how continued fractions behave under arithmetic operations. With that insight, perhaps we could find ways to combine the continued fractions of certain constants and finding the values of some constants, like Apery's Constant and Catalan's, of which we do know the continued fraction representations but few more.

13253,Nice expression for minimum of three variables?,"As we saw here , the minimum of two quantities can be written using elementary functions and the absolute value function. $\min(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2} - \frac{|a-b|}{2}$ There's even a nice intuitive explanation to go along with this: If we go to the point half way between two numbers, then going down by half their difference will take us to the smaller one. So my question is: ""Is there a similar formula for three numbers?"" Obviously $\min(a,\min(b,c))$ will work, but this gives us the expression:
$$\frac{a+\left(\frac{b+c}{2} - \frac{|b-c|}{2}\right)}{2} - \frac{\left|a-\left(\frac{b+c}{2} - \frac{|b-c|}{2}\right)\right|}{2},$$
which isn't intuitively the minimum of three numbers, and isn't even symmetrical in the variables, even though its output is. Is there some nicer way of expressing this function?","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'elementary-functions']"
