1137445,Having problems finding $x$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.,"I have attempted this question but have not found a solution. I am currently stuck. Hints on how I may go further would be helpful. Thank You in advance. The Question: $$\frac{a^2b}{x^2} + \left(1+\frac{b}{x}\right)a = 2b+ \frac{a^2}{x}$$ What I have done so far that I believe is correct:
$$\frac{a^2b}{x^2} + \frac{ab}{x} + a = 2b+ \frac{a^2}{x}$$ If you would like to see other work that I have attempted on this question I can also place it up.",['algebra-precalculus']
1137451,How to understand intuitively the Stolz-Cesaro Theorem for sequences?,"I have to give a presentation on the theorem in Real Analysis with a fellow student. While I've looked over the proof and verified that, yes, step B does indeed follow logically from step A, etc. and have internalized the proof to the extent that I can replicate it myself on paper, I still feel that I have made little progress as to why this theorem works the way it does, i.e. what is the intuition behind the theorem, such that it should make sense that it follows the way it does. Therefore I ask: what kind of intuition is there about this theorem? It would also be helpful to understand how the theorem can be used effectively in analysis. I have seen it referred to as a sort of L'Hopital's rule for sequences, which certainly seems to make sense, but I similarly have little intuitive understanding of how that rule works, either. I am asking this question not only for my personal understanding, but also for the sake of being able to present it in an illuminating manner, such that the rest of the class can also come away with the same sort of intuition of how the theorem works and how it is useful. Any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: I should point out that the formulation of the theorem we are being tasked to prove is the following: Let $\lbrace a_n \rbrace$ , $\lbrace b_n \rbrace$ be sequences, ${b_n}$ strictly increasing and unbounded. Then if $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac {a_{n+1} - a_n}{b_{n+1} - b_n} = l$ for some $l \in \mathbb R$ , then $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = l$ also.","['sequences-and-series', 'intuition', 'real-analysis']"

1137596,Can we define the concept of limit without a topology?,"At the beginning the concept of limit is introduced for sequences thanks to the fact that the space in which we operate is a metric space. Then we introduce topology and we can define limits using neighbourhoods, and we see that any metric space is a topological space with a countable base of neighbourhoods (i.e. is a first-countable space). For a topological space that is not first-countable we can use nets and filters that generalize the concept of sequence, but we are always in a topological space.

I have found no solutions of it online, though I have developed one.

My answer : Let $R$ be a relation on $A$ that says : $(x,y) \in R$ iff $x|y$ and $y|x$ Which means : $R = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)\}$ In this case $""1""$ is both minimal and maximal. b)Give a general proof that if $R$ meets the above conditions, $R$ does not contain a greatest element and $R$ does not contain a least element. My answer : The greatest and the least element in a partially ordered set are comparable to every other element in a set(unlike minimal and maximal elements), if a relation meets the above conditions, there is at least 1 element which is not comparable to any other element in a set, which means it can't contain a greatest/least element. c)This is the problem that is in the title, which goes like this : Is there partially ordered set(relation) $S$ on $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, such that $""1""$ is the Greatest element in S, and $""1""$ is the least element in S.
Give an example of such relation (if it exists), or prove that it doesn't. Now, I can only think of a relation that goes : $(x,y) \in S$ iff $x+y = 2$ In this case, the relation should contain only the element (1,1), which means 1 would be the minimal, maximal, greatest and the least element in $S$, is this correct ?Can the same element even be greatest and least at the same time ?

1137841,Show that any solution of second order differential equation has atmost a countable number of zeroes $?$,"Question : Consider the second order differential equation $y''(t) + a(t) y'(t) + b(t) y(t) = 0$. Then any solution of the second order differential equation  has atmost a countable number of zeroes on $[a , b]$ . What I have tried: Let $S$ be the set of zeroes of $y(t)$. If $S$ is finite then there is nothing to prove. Let $S$ be infinite . I can easily prove that every zero of $y(t)$ is isolated. Since $[a ,b]$ is closed and bounded and $S$ is an ordered set,  So we can find a minimum element of $S$ say $t_1$ so that for  $t_1 \in S $, there exists a $\delta_{t_1}$ such that in $( t_1 - \delta_{t_1} , t_1 + \delta_{t_1})$, $y(t)$ has no zeroes other than $t_1$ Let $ t_2$  be the minimum of $S-\{t_1\}$ of $y(t)$ . So   for  $t_2 \in S $, there exists a $\delta_{t_2}$ such that in $( t_2 - \delta_{t_2} , t_2 + \delta_{t_2})$, $y(t)$ has no zeroes other than $t_2$ and $( t_2 - \delta_{t_2} , t_2 + \delta_{t_2}) \cap( t_2 - \delta_{t_2} , t_2 + \delta_{t_2}) = \phi$. Similarly we can proceed. Thus we can correspond for every $t \in S$ a rational number $ q_t $ which belongs to $( t - \delta , t + \delta)$ and since rational numbers are countable, so $S$ is countable.

Therefore: any subset has a minimum $\land$ every subset is a chain $\Rightarrow$ every chain has a lower bound $\Rightarrow$ there is a minimal element in $X$ by Zorn's lemma. $(X,\le)$ is totally ordered and therefore the minimal element is unique and is comparable with all the elements $\Rightarrow$ $X$ has a least element in the ordering $\Rightarrow$ $X$ is well ordered.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

I'm confused because they're full . For instance, a monic $m$ is an arrow which is left cancellable, i.e $$mf=mg\implies f=g$$ Hence, if the subcategory is not full, I can see it's possible for ""new monos"" to appear, since there are less arrows $f,g$ to check.

1138247,Invertability of Non-Square Derivatives and Implicit Function Theorem,"In the statement of the Implicit Function Theorem from Rudin, we are asked to assume as a condition that for some function:
$$ f: \mathbb{R}^{m+n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$
The derivative at some point $Df(x)$ is invertible. My question is about the invertibility of this non-square matrix. We can see that $Df(x)$ is a linear operator from $\mathbb{R}^{n + m}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ so so its matrix representation is not square. This would mean that the the determinant is not defined and hence the definition of invertiblity does not apply. However, $Df(x)$ is still a linear mapping so it would make sense for us to talk about this function as having an inverse when it is 1-to-1 and onto. Just by visualizing the 1-dimensional case, my intuition says that this would be the case whenever $Df(x) \neq 0$. The proof for such a claim doesn't seem difficult but I was wondering if someone could contribute some clarification for the distinctions between these two definitions and how they relate to the Implicit Function Theorem.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"

1138286,$f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$ $\iff$ $f$ is injective.,"Let $f:X\to Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty. Prove that a sufficient and essential condition for any two subsets $A,B\subseteq X$ to fulfill $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$ is that $f$ is injective. I sense there is some problem in my proof. I would be glad if you assisted me. $Attempt:$ Let $f$ be injective and let $A,B\subseteq X$ be two subsets. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $A\cap B=\emptyset$ $\Rightarrow$ $f(A\cap B)=\emptyset$. Since $f$ is injective then there are no two elements with the same image and therefore $f(A)\cap f(B) =\emptyset =f(A\cap B)$. Now suppose $A\cap B\ne \emptyset.$ Let $ y\in f(A\cap B)$. There exists an $x\in A\cap B$ such that $f(x)=y$. Since $x \in A$ then $f(x)=y\in f(A)$ and since $x \in B$ then $f(x)=y\in f(B)$ $\Rightarrow$ $y\in f(A)\cap f(B)$. Therefore $f(A\cap B)\subseteq f(A)\cap f(B)$. Now let $y\in f(A)\cap f(B)$. ( $f(A)\cap f(B)$ is not empty because if it were then $A$ and $B$ would have an empty intersection as well, which they don't.). Therefore $y\in f(A)$ and $y\in f(B)$ and therefore in $A$ there exists $x_1$ such that $f(x_1)=y$. The same with $B$, $f(x_2)=y$. By injectivity: $x_1=x_2 \Rightarrow x_1=x_2\in A\cap B\Rightarrow f(x_1)=y\in f(a\cap B)\Rightarrow f(A)\cap f(B)\subseteq f(A\cap B) \Rightarrow f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B).$ Necessary: Suppose it weren't necessary that $f$ is injective. Then there would exist a non-injective function $f$ such that for any two subsets $A,B\subseteq X$ we get $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$. $f$ is non-injective and therefore there would be $x_1,x_2\in X$ such that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$. Let us look at $\{x_1\},\{x_2\}\subseteq X$. $f(\{x_1\})\cap f(\{x_2\})=\{f(x_1)=f(x_2)\}\ne f(\{x_1\}\cap\{x_2\})=f(\emptyset)=\emptyset$.

I would like to request for references to research done as to whether the Euler prime of an odd perfect number can also be its largest factor. To be more specific, the Euler prime $q$ of an odd perfect number $N$ is the sole prime factor that occurs to an (odd) exponent $k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$.  That is, we can write this odd perfect number in the form $N = {q^k}{n^2}$, where $\gcd(q, n) = 1$. In an e-mail, it was communicated to me by Douglas Iannucci that his advisor, Peter Hagis Jr. , considered this possibility.  I was wondering if anybody here knows of any partial results in this direction. Thank you! [Added Feb 8 2015] We do know that the Euler prime $q$ is not the smallest prime factor of an odd perfect number $N = {q^k}{n^2}$.  To see why, it suffices to consider: $$q + 1 = \sigma(q) \mid \sigma(q^k) \mid 2N.$$","['perfect-numbers', 'reference-request', 'open-problem', 'number-theory']"

1138408,Showing a sequence of integrals converges to zero,"Let $\varphi$ be a complex-valued function which is analytic on $\{z \in \mathbb C : |z| \leq 2\}$, let $\gamma$ be the unit circle in the complex plane, and define $$
F_n(z) = \int_\gamma \frac{1}{s-z} \int_{-2}^{2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt\,ds,
$$ where $|z| < 1/2$. Main Question: Is it true that $F_n(z) \to 0$ uniformly for $|z| < 1/2$ as $n \to \infty$? We should note that the double integral exists.  Indeed, by properties of Cauchy-type integrals (see Gakhov, Boundary Value Problems or here ), the function $$
g(s) = \int_{-2}^{2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt
$$ is analytic on $\mathbb C \setminus [-2,2]$ and has continuous extensions from the upper and lower half-planes to the interval $(-2,2)$ which satisfy $$

$$ for $-2 < x < 2$.  Consequently, $g(s)$ is continuous on $\gamma$ except for two jump discontinuities at $s = \pm 1$. Idea for an approach I have an idea for an approach which I have so far been unable to make rigorous.  At the end are a couple of problems that I see with it that I would greatly appreciate some feedback on. First I'd like to split the inner integral up into $$
\int_{-2}^{2} = \int_{|t| < 1} + \int_{1 < |t| < 2},
$$ and so write $$
F_n(z) = \int_\gamma \frac{1}{s-z} \int_{|t| < 1} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt\,ds + \int_\gamma \frac{1}{s-z} \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt\,ds. \tag{1}
$$ Now switch the order of integration in both integrals.  The first becomes $$
\int_\gamma \frac{1}{s-z} \int_{|t| < 1} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt\,ds = \int_{|t|<1} e^{-nt^2} \varphi(t) \int_\gamma \frac{ds}{(s-z)(t-s)}\,dt,
$$ and the inner integral here is $$
\int_\gamma \frac{ds}{(s-z)(t-s)} = 2\pi i \left(\frac{1}{t-z} - \frac{1}{t-z}\right) = 0.
$$ The second integral in $(1)$ becomes $$
\begin{align}
\int_\gamma \frac{1}{s-z} \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-s}\,dt\,ds &= \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-nt^2} \varphi(t) \int_\gamma \frac{ds}{(s-z)(t-s)}\,dt \\
&= 2\pi i \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-z}\,dt,
\end{align}
$$ so we conclude that $$
F_n(z) = 2\pi i \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-nt^2} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-z}\,dt.
$$ Then $$
\begin{align}
e^{n} |F_n(z)| &= 2\pi \left| \int_{1 < |t| < 2} e^{-n(t^2-1)} \frac{\varphi(t)}{t-z}\,dt \right| \\
&\leq 2\pi \cdot \operatorname{Length}(\{1 < |t| < 2\}) \cdot \sup_{1 < |t| < 2} \left( e^{-n(t^2-1)} \frac{|\varphi(t)|}{|t-z|} \right) \\
&\leq 2\pi \cdot 2 \cdot \sup_{1 < |t| < 2} \left(1 \cdot \frac{|\varphi(t)|}{1/2} \right) \\
&\leq C
\end{align}
$$ for some constant $C > 0$, so $$
|F_n(z)| \leq Ce^{-n} \to 0
$$ uniformly for $|z| < 1/2$ as $n \to \infty$. There are a couple of issues that I see with this: Can the interchange of order of integration be justified in both cases?

I use this to find the percentage of all possible pairs of integers in the range, when applying the operation, is still in the range. Of course, these operations work on the binary representation of the integers. I will let $P_{op}([a, b])$ be a value between 0 and 1 which is the percentage of integer pairs $(x, y) \in [a, b] \times [a,b]$ such that $x$ op $y \in [a, b]$ . I have not found any material that finds the probability directly, so I wrote a program to do it for me. However, I am noticing strange behavior. As examples, I provide outputs of some runs, where $b-a \in \{284, 759, 951\}$ (randomly selected). The horizontal axis denotes $a$ (the low end of the range), and the vertical axis denotes the respective $P_{op}$ .

As stated in my previous question, I do not have functional analysis background, but I want to still understand the proof. So my five questions will be fundamental and basic. Any answers and clarifications are welcomed. NB: For anyone who is about to suggest me to read suggested books or point out that I have a lack of background in functional analysis (and even theoretical linear algebra), please don't. Because I already know that. As suggested by a user on my previous question, I plan to read the Haim Brezis textbook over the summer when I don't have classes in the regular school semesters. With that said, I am printing the theorem below, along with the second excerpt of the textbook's proof and my basic questions to follow. (PDE Evans, Appendix D, Theorem 5) THEOREM 5 (Fredholm Alternative) . Let $K : H \to H$ be a compact linear operator. Then (i) $N(I-K)$ is finite dimensional, (ii) $R(I-K)$ is closed, (iii) $R(I-K)=N(I-K^*)^\perp$ , (iv) $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ if and only if $R(I-K)=H$ , and (v) $\dim N(I-K)=\dim N(I-K^*)$ . The second excerpt of the textbook proof: Assertion (iii) is now a consequence of (ii) and the general fact that $$\overline{R(A)}=N(A^*)^\perp \text{ for each bounded linear operator }A: H \to H.$$ a. Can the overline in $\overline{R(A)}$ be explained? Why do we not need the overline for statement (iii), $R(I-K)=N(I-K^*)^\perp$ ? To verify (iv), let us suppose to start with that $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ , but $H_1=(I-K)(H) \subsetneq H$ . According to (ii), $H_1$ is a closed subspace of $H$ . Furthermore $H_2 \equiv (I-K)(H_1) \subsetneq H_1$ , since $I-K$ is one-to-one. Similarly if we write $H_k \equiv (I-K)^k(H)$ ( $k=1,\ldots$ ), we see that $H_k$ is a closed subspace of $H$ , $H_{k+1} \subsetneq H_k$ ( $k=1,\ldots$ ). Conversely, choose $u_k \in H_k$ with $\|u_k\|=1$ , $u_k \in H_{k+1}^\perp$ . Then $Ku_k-Ku_l=-(u_k-Ku_k)+(u_l-Ku_l)+(u_k-u_l)$ . Now if $k > l$ , $H_{k+1} \subsetneq H_k \subseteq H_{l+1} \subsetneq H_l$ . Thus $u_k-Ku_k$ , $u_l-Ku_l$ , $u_k \in H_{l+1}$ . Since $u_l \in H_{l+1}^\perp$ , $\|u_l\|=1$ , we deduce $\|Ku_k-Ku_l\| \ge 1$ ( $k,l=1,\ldots$ ). But this is impossible since $K$ is compact. b. I know that $I$ and $K$ considered linear transformations because $I$ is the identity operator (is this true?) and $K$ is given to be a compact linear operator. Hence, $I-K$ is a linear transformation, right? Due to a theorem from linear algebra, is it because $I-K$ established to be one-to-one because the nullspace $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ as initially given? c. Why does the one-to-one property $I-K$ implies that we can write $H_2 \equiv (I-K)(h_1) \subsetneq H_1$ , which would allow us to write after $k$ iterations $H_k \equiv (I-K)^k(H)$ ? d. How does $u_l \in H_{l+1}^\perp$ and $\|u_l\|=1$ suggest $\|Ku_k - Ku_l\| \ge 1$ , which would make $\{Ku_k\}$ not Cauchy and contradict the compactness of $K$ ? Ultimately, I cannot right now see the connection that allows us to conclude that the rank $R(I-K)=H$ , thereby proving the forward direction of (iv)... Now conversely assume $R(I-K)=H$ . Then owing to (iii), we see that $N(I-K^*)=\{0\}$ . Since $K^*$ is compact, we may utilize step 5 to conclude $R(I-K^*)=H$ . But then $N(I-K)=R(I-K^*)^\perp=\{0\}$ . This conclusion and step 5 complete the proof of assertion (iv). e. Given $R(I-K)=H$ , because of (iii) we have $N(I-K^*)^\perp=H$ . But how does the transpose of $N$ equivalency with $H$ imply $N(I-K)=\{0\}$ ? Follow-up part 3...","['linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

Limits are unique in metric spaces, so I suppose in this case it would be enough- but then what forms of convergence are stronger and weaker than other forms? For instance, almost uniform convergence doesn't imply a unique limit- we could have a function that almost uniformly converges to both a continuous function, and a discontinuous function!

1138711,Fourier COSINE Transform (solving PDE - Laplace Equation),"I'm trying to solve Laplace equation using Fourier Cosine Transform (I have to use that), but I don't know if I'm doing everything OK.

Duffy and this is what I'm doing (maybe you have a better way): Now, since $x$ is between from $0$ to $a$ and $y$ is between $0$ and $\infty$ , I use the definition of Fourier Cosine Transform and: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} u_{xx} \cos{(w y)} \ dy + \int_{0}^{\infty} u_{yy} \cos{(w y)} \ dy = 0$$ where: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} u_{xx}.cos(w.y) dy = U_{yy}(x,w)$$ $$\int_{0}^{\infty} u_{yy}.cos(w.y) dy = [u_y(x,y).cos(w.y)] - w.[u(x,y).sin(w.y)] - w.\int_{0}^{\infty}u(x,y).cos(w.y) dy$$ Note: I don't know how to write the Barrow Rule in LaTeX. Where it says [...] it's Barrow from $0$ to $\infty$ Now, I know that: $[u_y(x,y).cos(w.y)] = 0$ because of the conditions: $u_y(x,0) =0$ and $|u(x,y)|<M$ (is that ok?)

1138752,what is the minimum number of conjugacy classes for a group of order $n!$?,"i became curious about how one might measure the extent to which a given finite group departs from perfect commutativity. a rough-and-ready index of the degree to which a group $G$ is commutative may be computed as the proportion of ordered pairs $(g_1,g_2) \in G \times G$ for which $g_1g_2 = g_2 g_1$ calculating this index, let us call it $\kappa$, turned out to be simpler than i had anticipated. described in words, the probability of two randomly sampled elements commuting is equal to the number of conjugacy classes divided by the order of the group. let $\Gamma (=\Gamma_G)$ denote the set of conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$. for every element $g$ of $G$ belonging to $\gamma \in \Gamma$ the number of elements of $G$ which commute with $g$ is the order of $G_g$, the centralizer of $g$. by a basic result of group theory:
$$
|G_g| = \frac{|G|}{|\gamma|}
$$
thus the probability that a randomly-chosen pair of elements of $G$ commute (sampling with replacement) is:
$$
\kappa(G) = \frac{\sum_{g \in G} |G_g|}{|G|^2} \\
 = \frac{|\Gamma_G|}{|G|}  \\

I want to check mine: We consider all the cards except the aces indistinguishable,and we will consider the aces to be indistinguishable.Now a deck is just a binary string with $48$ $C$ and $4$ $A$ ( $A$ stands for aces and $C$ stands for the other cards.Obviously,the number of such strings is $\dbinom{52}{4}$ . Now we divide into cases: 1)Number of strings with the first A in the $1$ st position: $\dbinom{51}{3}$ 2)Number of strings with  the first A in the $2$ nd position: $\dbinom{50}{3}$ .

  .

  . Number of strings with the first A in the $49$ th position: $\dbinom{3}{3}$ Since there are $4$ A's,the first $A$ cannot be in the $50$ th position.

The split in two answers was necessary due to the restriction of up to $30000$ characters per answer. I could prove the other parts, but this final part still needed a verification. In the meanwhile I found an answer and the solution is now provided as part of  my follow-up answer starting there with expression (48).

It says something like given an effective divisor on a scheme $X$, we may define the ideal sheaf corresponding to $\mathscr{I}$ be $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ in the exact sequence $$ 0\rightarrow \mathcal{O}(-D)\rightarrow \mathcal O_{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{D}\rightarrow 0$$ Then he defines the canonical section $s_{D}$ be as follows: tensoring with $\mathcal{O}(D)$ in the sequence, we get a morphism of sheaves $$ \mathcal{O}_{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}(D)$$ which gives us a canonical section. I don't understand what this means, so I presume that if we take the global section, we have a mapping of $A$-modules (all rings are denoted by $A$) $$ \mathcal{O}_{X}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{O}(D)(X)$$ sending $1$ to some element $f\in \mathcal{O}(D)(X)=\mathcal{O}(-D)^{\vee}(X)=\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\mathcal{O}(-D)|_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X}|_{X})$ So based on this observation, I need to show Ex 14.3.B: show that $Z(s_{D})$ is exactly the subscheme cut out by
  $D$. But an effective divisor in the sense of R. Vakil's notes is actually an effective Cartier divisor. In some other sources (See Götz-Wedhorn Algebraic Geometry I, page 305, Remark 11.31(2)) the canonical divisor $s_{D}$ is defined to be as follows: since $D$ is effective Cartier, there exists $(U_{i},f_{i})_{i}$ where $U_{i}$ is an affine covering of $X$ and $f_{i}\in \Gamma(U_{i},\mathscr{K}^{*}_{X})$ Question 1 : If $D$ is effective but $X$ is NOT assumed to be reduced, can we still assume that $f_{i}\in\Gamma(U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})$? Because if it is not reduced, we cannot use Algebraic Hartog's lemma... Then in Götz-Wedhorn, they define the canonical section $s_{D}$ to be exactly the data $(U_{i},f_{i})$. Or so it seems to me because it was written Let $V$ be any open subset of $X$. Then $\Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}(D))$
  consists of $s\in\Gamma(V,\mathscr{K}_{X})$ such that
  $sf_{i}\in\Gamma(V\cap U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})$. Then $s_{D}$
  corresponds to $1\in \Gamma(X,\mathscr{K}_{X})$. (Here, we assume that $X=U_{eff}$ since $D$ is an effective divisor.) Then it is clear from here that the zeros of the canonical section $s_{D}$ is defined by $V(f_{i})$ in $U_{i}$, which is exactly the closed subscheme as by the definition of an effective Cartier divisor (in the sense of R. Vakil). Question 2: How is this related to the $s_{D}$ in the definition in R. Vakil's notes? If they are related, then I can answer the exercise question straightaway.

$\DeclareMathOperator{\ham}{ham}$ The result to be proved is: Any linearly independent set $S \subset V$ in any linear space $V$ can
  be extended to a Hamel basis $S' \supset S$. The authors first prove this theorem themselves, using an auxiliary well-ordered set $I$, of cardinality greater than that of $V$.  They use transfinite recursion to construct a partial function $f$, defined on a proper initial segment of $I$, taking values in $V$; and they show that the union of $S$ with the range of this function $f$ constitutes a Hamel basis of $V$, as required.  Then they write: We could also have avoided the use of an auxiliary set $I$ of large
  cardinality by introducing a well-ordering on $V$.  At each step we
  c0nsider some element $v \in V$; if it is not a linear combination of
  current basis elements, then we add $v$ to the basis; otherwise the
  basis remains unchanged. Problem 112. Provide missing details in this proof. I don't know how transfinite recursion is normally presented, so I quote in full a theorem which they proved earlier (changing the notation for the least element of a well-ordered set from '$0$' to '$\bot$', to avoid confusion with the zero element of $V$): Let $A$ be a well-ordered set, and $B$ an arbitrary set.  Let a
  recursive rule be given, that is, a mapping $F$ whose arguments are an
  element $x \in A$ and a function $g: [\bot, x) \to B$, and whose value
  is an element of $B$.  Then there exists exactly one function $f: A \to B$
  such that
  $$ f(x) = F\big(x, f|_{[\bot, x)}\big) $$
  for all $x \in A$. Choose separate well-orderings for $S$ and $V \setminus S$, and well-order $V$ as
$S + (V \setminus S)$. In the theorem just quoted, take $A = V$, and $B = \powerset(V)$. For $x \in V$ and $f: V \to \powerset(V)$, define:
$$
f(x-) = \bigcup_{w < x} f(w), \\
\ham(f) = \{ x \in V : x \notin \sspan{f(x-)} \}.
$$ [I'm accustomed, from some time long ago, to using the notation '$\sspan{X}$' for the subspace spanned by a subset $X$ of a vector space, but can this notation be used without explanation, as I've just done?] From the theorem, it follows that there exists a unique function $f: V \to \powerset(V)$ such that, for all $x \in V$:
$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
f(x-) & \text{if } x \notin \ham(f) \\
f(x-) \cup \{x\} & \text{if } x \in \ham(f)
\end{cases}
$$ For all $x \in V$, if $w \leqslant x$ and $w \in \ham(f)$, then $w \in f(w) \subseteq f(x-) \subseteq f(x)$; so, $f(x) \supseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x]$. Conversely, also, $f(x) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x]$. This is proved by transfinite induction on $x$, thus: if $f(w) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, w]$ for all $w < x$, then
$f(x-) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x)$, and so $f(x) \subseteq \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x]$. We have proved $f(x) = \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x]$, for all $x \in V$. Hence, $f(x-) = \ham(f) \cap [\bot, x)$ for all $x \in V$. Therefore, for all $x \in V$, $x \in \ham(f)$ if and only if
$x \notin \sspan{\ham(f) \cap [\bot, x)}$. In particular, because $S$ is linearly independent, and because it is an initial segment of $V$, for all $x \in S$ we have $x \notin \sspan{[\bot, x)}$, therefore $x \in \ham(f)$. So, $S \subseteq \ham(f)$. If $F$ is a non-empty finite subset of $\ham(f)$, let $x$ be its largest element (w.r.t. the well-ordering of $V$); then $x \notin \sspan{F \setminus \{x\}}$.  Hence, $\ham(f)$ is
linearly independent. Also, for all $x \in V$, we have $x \in \sspan{f(x)} \subseteq \sspan{\ham(f)}$. So, $\ham(f)$ spans $V$. Therefore, $\ham(f)$ is a Hamel basis of $V$, which extends $S$.  Q.E.D. [I had to break off from writing this question, yesterday, in order to go to bed; and when trying to sleep, I managed to simplify and shorten the proof.  I really only managed to complete it today, because it wasn't as ""routine"" as I imagined.  It doesn't look quite so clumsy now, but the question still seems worth asking.] D'oh!  Wouldn't a much simpler approach have been to use transfinite recursion to define a function from $V$ into a two-element set, such as $\{0, 1\}$, or $\{false, true\}$, instead of $\powerset(V)$?  I'll think about it tomorrow - I don't want another exhausting bedtime, when I find it's not as simple as it looks!

1139097,A question about partially ordered sets and their subsets,"I was reading about partially ordered sets and in the book, a theorem was proven. The theorem was that, given an poset, $(X, \le)$ there exists a set $Y$ of subsets of $X$ such that $(X, \le) \cong (Y, \subset)$. The proof went as follows: ""For each $a \in X$, let $Z_a = \{b \in X : b \le a\}$, and let $Y = \{Z_a : a \in X\}$. Define a map $\pi$ from $X$ to $Y$ by $\pi(a) = Z_a$. Clearly $\pi$ is a bijection. Moreover $a_1 \le a_2 \iff Z_{a_1} \subset Z_{a_2}$, so $\pi$ is an isomorphism between $(X, \le)$ and $(Y, \subset)$."" I understand why these two sets are isomorphic, but I don't understand why $Y$ is a subset of $X$. If $(X, \le)$, then there is a relation on $X$ and a relation is defined to be a subset of the Cartesian product. If thats the case, then the relation set must be a set of ordered pairs. The set $Z_a$ is the set of all elements which have a partial order on $a$. $Y$ is the set of all $Z_a$'s. But, if every $Z_a$ is based on only that which has a relation on $a$, doesn't that break the ordered pairs (since they are in the form $(a,b)$, and with any $a$ considered, only the $b$ elements would be in the set) and imply that ordered pairs cant be in any $Z_a$ set? The only other interpretation I can think of is that $a$ itself is an ordered pair, because its a member of $X$, but then, I don't see how its possible for any $Z_a$ to have elements, given its definition. Am I misunderstanding something?","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

1139251,Fermat's Last Theorem simple proof,"I came across this simple proof of Fermat's last theorem. Some think it's legit. Some argued that the author's assumptions are flawed. It's rather lengthy but the first part goes like this: Let $x,y$ be $2$ positive non-zero coprime integers and $n$ an integer greater than $2$. According to the binomial theorem:$$(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}{y^k}$$
then,$$(x+y)^n-x^n=nx^{n-1}y+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}{y^k}+y^{n}$$
$$(x+y)^n-x^n=y(nx^{n-1}+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^{k-1}+y^{n-1})$$ $$y(nx^{n-1}+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^{k-1}+y^{n-1})=z^n$$ In the first case, he assumed that the 2 factors are coprime when $\gcd(y,n)=1$ . Then he wrote: 
$$y=q^n$$
$$ nx^{n-1}+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^{k-1}+y^{n-1}=p^n$$
By replacing $y$ by $q^n$,
\begin{equation} nx^{n-1}+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}q^{n(k-1)}+q^{n(n-1)}=p^n (*)
\end{equation} from this bivariate polynomial,he fixed alternatively $x$ and $y=q^n$ and by applying the rational root theorem, he obtained  $$q^{n(n-1)}-p^n=nxt   $$ and $$  nx^{n-1}-p^n=q^ns $$ 
($s,t$ non-zero integers)
by equating $p^x$: $$ q^{n(n-1)}-sq^n=nx(t-x^{n-2})$$
Then, he uses one of the trivial solutions of Fermat's equations. He wrote, when $x+y=1$,if $x=0$ then $y=1$ and vice versa. Therefore, he wrote: 
$x=0$ iff $q^{n(n-1)}=sq^n$, he obtains: $$q=1$$ or $$s=q^{n-2}$$ By substituting $s$ by $q^{n-2}$ in $nx^{n-1}-p^n=q^ns$, he obtains: $$nx^{n-1}-p^n=q^{n(n-1)}$$
Then, he replace that expression in equation (*) and pointed out that:$$\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}q^{n(k-1)}=0$$. Since $x,y=q^n$ are positive integers for all $n>2$, a sum of positive numbers can not be equal to zero. Which leads to a contradiction.
