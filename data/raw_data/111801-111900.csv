So, since we're mapping from $[a,b] \to [f(a), f(b)]$, the range is made up of the images of the values in the domain, that is, the range is the codomain.

1615971,Escaping Prisoner Probability Question,"Question: A prisoner is trapped in a cell containing three doors. The first door leads to a tunnel which
returns him to his cell after two days travel. The second door leads to a tunnel that returns
him to his cell after three days travel. The third door leads immediately to freedom. (a) Assuming the prisoner will always select doors 1, 2 and 3 with probabilities 0.5, 0.3 and
0.2 respectively, what is the expected number of days until he reaches freedom? (b) Calculate the variance of the number of days until the prisoner reaches freedom. My Attempt so far: I've used first step decomposition to get an answer of $9.5$ days to the first part of the question, but I have no idea how to find the variance for part (b). I've tried using the Law of Total Variance but got nowhere. I don't know whether you're supposed to use $Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$, where $X$ is the number of days taken to reach freedom. If so, how do you go about finding $E(X^2)$? Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['statistics', 'probability']"

If instead we are working in the unit square for example and the path $\Xi$ is instead the graph of a continuous function $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ then I can do it. Define the sets $U=${$(x,y):f(x)>y$}$,\;L= ${$(x,y):f(x)<y$}$ $ U and L are open because f is continuous. They are both nonempty because the graph of f has a point in the interior. and they obviously partition the space $[0,1]^2-\Xi$ so we are done. any help or references in the general case would be heavily appreciated.

1616138,Volume of 1/2 using hull of finite point set with diameter 1,"It's easy to bound a volume of a half.  For example, the points $(0,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0),(3,0,0)$ can do it.  The problem is harder if no two points can be further than 1 apart. Bound a volume of 1/2 with a diameter $\le 1$ point set. With infinite points at distance 1/2 from the origin, a volume of $\pi/6 = 0.523599...$ can be bound. But we want a finite point set. What is the minimal number of points? (A 99 point set used to be here.  See Answers for a much better 82 point set) Here's a picture of the hull. Each vertex is numbered. Green vertices have one or more corresponding blue faces with vertices at distance 1. Each blue face has a brown number giving the opposing green vertex. Red vertices and yellow faces lack a face/vertex pairing. Some may think that Thomson problem solutions might give a better answer. The first diameter 1 Thomson solution with a volume of 1/2 is 121 points with volume .500069. These points will not fit in a diameter 1 sphere, but the maximal distance between points is less than 1. Similarly, a unit equilateral triangle will not fit in a diameter 1 circle. Is 99 points minimal for bounding a volume of 1/2 using a point set with diameter 1?  Or, to phrase it as a hypothesis: 99 Point Hypothesis 99 points of diameter 1 in Euclidean space. 99 points with a volume of a 1/2. Take one off, move them around (without increasing diameter) You can't get a volume of 1/2 any more.","['volume', 'polyhedra', 'geometry', 'combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics']"
1616144,Name for a ring that also has composition - aka function application?,"What is the following type of ring? Does it have a name? Suppose $(R,\cdot,+,0,1)$ is a ring with another binary operation, $\circ$ with the properties: $$(a\circ b)\circ c=a\circ(b\circ c)\\
(a+b)\circ c=(a\circ c)+(b\circ c)\\
(a\cdot b)\circ c = (a\circ c)\cdot (b\circ c)\\
0\circ c = 0; 1\circ c=1$$ Many of these rings have a left-right $\circ$-identity. Foundational Example 1: Given a ring $S$, the set $S^S$ of all functions $S\to S$ with point-wise addition and multiplication and composition for $\circ$: $$(f+g)(s)=f(s)+g(s)\\(fg)(s)=f(s)g(s)(f\circ g)(s)=f(g(s))$$ This has a left-right $\circ$ identity, $I(s)=s$. Every algebra $R$ of this sort with a right $\circ$ identity in this class is isomorphic to a sub-algebra of some $S^S$, specifically, with $S=R$. This is because if $f_a=c\mapsto a\circ c$ then if $f_a=f_b$ then $a=f_a(X)=f_b(X)=b$ where $X$ is the right identity. Foundational example 2: Given a commutative ring $S$, $S[x]$ with polynomial composition.
This case has a left-right $\circ$ identity, $x$. Continuous functions: Given a topological ring, the set of continuous functions $S\to S$ satisfies this condition, with the identity function a left-right $\circ$-identity. Entire functions: The ring of entire functions $\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ is an integral domain, containing (an isomorphic image of) $\mathbb C[x]$, with $\circ$ being standard function composition. Less well-known example: The set of all functions $f:\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$ with the condition: $$f(m)\equiv f(n)\pmod{m-n}$$ for all $m,n\in\mathbb Z$. This ring is an odd integral domain that contains an isomorphic image of $\mathbb Z[x]$, since every integer polynomial function is of this sort, but there are more elements that are non-polynomials (and some non-integer polynomial functions, too.) It has $I(n)=n$ as a left-right $\circ$ identity. The condition can be seen as requiring some ""smoothness"" of the functions in all the $p$-adic metrics. They can be seen as matching a certain strong uniform continuity/Lipshitz continuity in all the $p$-adics.In particular, for any $p$, we have that $f$ can be extended to the $p$-adic numbers uniquely to make it continuous, and $\|f(a)-f(b)\|_p\leq \|a-b\|_p$ for all $p$-adic integers $a,b$.  Indeed, it is essentially a ""bounded Lipshitz"" criterion - this doesn't work in general, but does work in non-Archimedian valuation rings. Related: If $(S,\|\|_S)$ is a non-Archimedian valuation ring with bounded valuation $\|s\|_S\leq 1$ (think the $p$-adic integers, or the rational integers under the $p$-adic norm.) Then we can take the ring $R$ of functions $f:S\to S$ with the
property: $$\|f(r)-f(s)\|_S\leq \|r-s\|_S$$ This is a ring of the above sort. If we take $S=(\mathbb Z,\|\|_p)$, the integers with the $p$-adic norm, this set $R_p$ is just all functions  $f:\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$ such that $p^k\mid f(n+p^k)-f(n)$ for all $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $k>0$. Then the original ring at the beginning of this section can be seen as $\bigcap_p R_p$. The intersection of sub-algebras is always a sub-algebra. Near misses - without multiplicative unit: The ring of meromorphic functions $\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ is almost of this form, but when $c(x)=C$ is constant and $h(x)$ is not defined at $C$, we don't get a meromorphic function. However, if we relax the condition, and not require $R$ to have a multiplicative unit, we can take the ring of meromorphic functions  $f$ with $f(0)=0$. Then the set of such functions is such a ring. A related near miss: The sub-algebra of $S[[x]]$ of formal power series over a ring $S$, with no constant term. Again, no multiplicative unit, but everything else satisfied. Properties: For any $f\in R$, $R_{f}=\{a\circ f\mid a\in R\}$ is a sub-algebra. The condition that $0\circ f=0,1\circ f=1$ shows that $0,1\in R_f$. Indeed, $R_f$ is a sub-algebra, because $(a\circ f)\circ (b\circ f)=(a\circ f\circ b)\circ f$. More generally, given $g\in R$ and $a\in R_f$ then $g\circ a\in R_f$. So $R_f$ is sort of like a $\circ$-right-ideal. For example, the sub-algebra of even entire functions is $R_{x^2}$. The subring $R_0=\{a\circ 0\mid a\in R\}$ has the property that if $r\in R_0$ then $r\circ f = (a\circ 0)\circ f = a\circ(0\circ f)=a\circ 0=r$ for any $f$. Note that $R_0\subseteq R_f$ for any $f$. Indeed, if $r\in R_0$ then $r=a\circ 0 = a\circ(0\circ f)=(a\circ 0)\circ f$. Now, if $f\in R_0$, we get $R_0=R_f$ because $a=a\circ f =a\circ(f\circ 0) = (a\circ f)\circ 0$. On the other hand, if $a=a\circ f$ for all $f$, then $a=a\circ 0$ so $a\in R_0$. Basically, $R_0$ is really ""all"" of the constant functions. Also, for $f\in R$ and $r\in R_0$, $f\circ r\in R_0$.","['terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"

1616177,"Draw cards repeatedly, until we find the ace of spades. Probability that we draw between 20 and 30 cards?","consider this problem: Draw cards repeatedly, without replacement, from a standard 52-card deck until we find the ace of spades. What is the probability that we draw between 20 and 30 cards? The solution I came across:
$$P(A)=\frac{11}{52}$$
where the numerator denotes the sum from the 20th to the 30th draw, and the denominator the sum of all possible draws from the 1st until the 52nd. I've thought about this problem a lot, and I just do not understand the thinking put behind it, this problem clearly requires more attention, order does matter and the fact that the cards drawn can not be replaced made me doubt the above solution. The solution that I believe is correct:
$$P(A)=\frac{1}{33}+\frac{1}{32}+\frac{1}{31}+...+\frac{1}{23}$$
Why? 
Well the first 19 drawn cards must have resulted in other values than the ones required and considering the fact that cards drawn can not be replaced, the denominator or sample space always decreases by 1 until exactly the criterion of having to draw between 20 and 30 cards is met.

If $L$ is a line bundle on an affine scheme $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$, and $c(L) = \oplus_{n \geq 0} L^{\otimes n}$ (does this ring have a name?) is $Proj_A(c(L)) = Spec(A)$, with structure map the identity? (The sketch of this proof would be: over each trivialization $\operatorname{spec} A_f$, with nowhere vanishing global section $l$,  $(c(L)_l)_0 = A_f$ (literally equals I think, or at any rate ""natural"", and the structure map is the identity. Now everything glues.) (Similarly, global proj of the $c(O_X)$ on a scheme $X$ should be $X$ again, with structure map the identity - ""every scheme is projective over itself"". Also, by using global spec with $O_X$, every scheme is affine over itself - this is easier to see, because of course the identity map is an affine map, using the criterion that it pulls back open affines to open affines. But I don't know a similar characterization for projective maps, which right now I am thinking of as maps of the form $Proj B_* \to X$, for $B_*$ a finite type quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ graded $A$ algebras on $X$. ) I think these are basically trivial to prove if true, and have sketched arguments for both, but it is easy to make mistakes because there are so many details, especially when invoking the phrase ""this is natural so it glues""... I am hoping someone can glance at these statements and tell me if they are true or not - or preferably recommend some reference were I can see them.

1616520,"Does the sum of exterior angles of a simple, convex polygon truly = 360°?","The question being asked of me is the following: What is the sum of a polygon's exterior angles? Assuming, again, that the polygon is simple and convex, the answer I see repeatedly given is 360°.  I'm wondering if there are some other criteria for defining an exterior angle that I'm ignorant of, because if we say only that an exterior angle is the angle around a vertex that is not the interior angle, or put another way, that an exterior angle is 360°- $\measuredangle interior$ , centered at a vertex, how does the sum of all vertices' exterior angles = 360°? An example Let there be a drawing!  ...or two: Exterior angle: exterior angle Am I defining exterior angle incorrectly?  The most common illustrations employed essentially lob off 180° from every exterior angle so that they fit nicely together into a kind of pie chart, but no reasoning is given for ignoring 180° from each vertex.  (I can't link to an example because I'm limited to two links.)  The illustrations suppose that the polygon is shrunk to a size where the polygon becomes only a one-dimensional point, i.e. where the polygon is no longer a polygon and doesn't have even interior angles.  Is there justification for this?  My essential question is, if an interior angle = 30°, why isn't the exterior angle = 330°? I'll use the following polygon as an example: triangle $\sum\measuredangle interior=a+b+c$ $\text{ }=(360-A)+(360-B)+(360-C)$ $\text{ }=3*360-(A+B+C)$ $\text{ }=1080-\sum\measuredangle exterior$ $\text{ }=180^\circ$ (a given, since it's a triangle) $\Longrightarrow A+B+C=1080-180=900^\circ$ $\sum\measuredangle exterior=900^\circ$ General solution For any n -sided polygon, with interior angles a, b, ... n : $\sum\measuredangle interior=a+b+...+n$ $\text{ }=(360-A)+(360-B)+...+(360-N)$ $\text{ }=360n-(A+B+...+N)$ $\text{ }=360n-\sum\measuredangle exterior$ Using the equation for the sum of interior angles of an n -sided polygon, $(n-2)180$ , $(n-2)180=360n-\sum\measuredangle exterior$ $\mathbf{\Longrightarrow\sum\measuredangle exterior=(n+2)180}$ For the triangle, this also works out to 900°. For a hexagon, for example: $\sum\measuredangle exterior=6*180+360=1440^\circ$ Granted, these answers have nothing to do with whether my definition of exterior angle is correct, but they're simply the answers I would get. Also, for n =0, such as when the polygon is shrunk down to a point, as in the illustrations previously mentioned, the equation gives the expected 360°.","['definition', 'geometry']"

1617032,Arithmetic genus of complete intersection going wrong,"I want to compute the arithmetic genus of the complete intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3$. I know the adjunction formula is one way of doing this, but I am keen to understand where my approach is failing (I know it is failing because I expect to get $1$ as the genus, but I am getting $0$). My definition of arithmetic genus is $p_a(X) := (-1)^{\text{dim }X}(\chi(\mathscr{O}_X) - 1)$. For $X$ an irreducible projective curve, this turns out to be $h^1(X,\mathscr{O}_X)$. Here is my approach: let $C := Q_1\cap Q_2$ (with inclusion $i : C \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$) be the complete intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3$. Assume everything is over an algebraically closed field $k$. Since $C$ is a complete intersection, the ideal sheaf $\mathscr{I}_C$ is isomorphic to $\mathscr{I}_{Q_1} + \mathscr{I}_{Q_2}$ (by Hartshorne II. Ex. 8.4). Further, we know that since $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are hypersurfaces, $\mathscr{I}_{Q_i} \cong \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(-2)$. So $\mathscr{I}_C \cong \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(-2)^{\oplus 2}$. We then look at the short exact sequence of sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^3$ corresponding to the closed subscheme $C$:
$$
0 \rightarrow \mathscr{I}_C = \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(-2)^{\oplus 2} \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3} \rightarrow i_*\mathscr{O}_C \rightarrow 0
$$ Taking cohomology, we know that $H^i(\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}) = 0$ for $i = 1,2$ which leaves us with $H^1(i_*\mathscr{O}_C) \cong H^2(\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(-2))^{\oplus 2}$. But I know that the latter is $0$, which means that $h^1(\mathscr{O}_C) = 0$. But this doesn't make sense since I know $C$ should be a quartic elliptic curve which implies $h^1(\mathscr{O}_C) = 1$.

1617208,calculation of median of grouped data,"While calculating the median of grouped data of total frequency $N$ , in order to find the median class which value should be taken into consideration to match against cumulative frequency : $\frac N2$ or $\frac{N+1}{2}$ (it seems both are used)? I think $\frac{N+1}{2}$ should be taken since in case of list of values (i.e. ungrouped data), its fractional value indicates that the average of $\frac N2 th$ and $(\frac N2 + 1) th$ values should give the median. And then comes the second part of my question -- while calculating the median of grouped data, if the value of $\frac{N+1}{2}$ ( or $\frac N2$ ) is a fraction, say 50.5, and there is a cumulative frequency 50, then what should we do? Should we take two median classes, one having cumulative frequency 50 and another coming next to it, and calculate two medians considering each of the median class using the formula: $L + \frac {\frac N2 - C}{f} \times w$ and take their average as the ultimate median? Or do something else? I mean what is the correct procedure in this kind of situation? EDIT: So, here is a specific problem regarding the second part of my question- We have to find out the median score from the following frequency distribution table: Score                :  0-10    10-20    20-30    30-40    40-50
Number of students   :   4        3        5        6        7
Cumulative frequency :   4        7        12       18       25 Here intervals are of type (,] . Now, $N=25 \implies  \frac N2 = 12.5$ , which means that we have to look for the interval which covers 12th item and 13th item. Looking at the cumulative frequencies, we see that the 3rd interval(i.e. 20-30) covers the 12th item,while 4th interval(i.e. 30-40) covers the 13th item. If we are supposed to take both the intervals as median class for the sake of using the formula: $median=L + \frac {\frac N2 - C}{f} \times w$ , then we will end up with two medians. We can take the average of these as the required median, though. I want to know the correct procedure here. Note 1: I am only concerned with using the above formula and not any other method of finding median of grouped data. There is a variation of the above formula where $\frac{N+1}{2}$ is used instead of $\frac N2$ , the first part of my question refers to this confusion as well. Note 2: In the formula, L = lower boundary of the median class
N = total frequency
C = cumulative frequency of the class preceding the median class
f = frequency of the median class
w = width of the median class i.e. upper boundary - lower boundary Note 3: If we consider the interval 20-30 as the median class and use the above formula, then the median will be $20 + \frac{\frac{25}{2} - 7}{5} \times 10 = 31$ Interestingly , considering the interval 30-40 as the median class, we would get the same median using the above formula. Though, I am not sure if this will be the case for every problem of this type. In that case we can take any of the two interval as the median class. Note 4: I don't know whether there is any rule for such kind of situation saying that we have to select that cumulative frequency (and hence the corresponding interval as the median class) which is nearer to the value of $\frac N2$ , in that case we have to take the interval 20-30 in this example as median class. It will be great and enough if anyone can confirm such a rule.","['statistics', 'data-analysis', 'median']"

And more generally: how could I find all the different values $x_{\alpha}$ for which $\Gamma[x_{\alpha}] = n$ for a fixed real $n$ ($n\neq \{-1; -2; -3; \ldots \}$)","['functions', 'integral-equations', 'special-functions', 'factorial', 'gamma-function']"
1617601,Set of Discontinuities for a function $f$,"Take $f$ to be a function over the reals. I want to show that
a set of discontinuities of the first kind for $f$ are
countable. This is the discontinuity type at point $P \in \mathbb{R}$
where $lim_{x \rightarrow P^{-}} f(x)$ and
$\lim_{x \rightarrow P^{+}} f(x)$ both exist but either do not equal
each other or do not equal $f(P).$ The suggestion given to me is
that if there is a discontinuity but the right and left limits
exist, I can slip a rational number between them. Hence, I am
considering showing this countability by developing a bijection
between the set of discontinuities and the rationals, although I
am having difficulty formalizing this in the language of functions.
Any assistance will be appreciated.",['functions']
1617619,geometric meaning of blowing up the affine space at a line,"The blow-up $\tilde{X}$ of $\mathbb{A}^3$ at the line $\ell: x_1=x_2=0$ is by definition the closure in $\mathbb{A}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ of the graph of the function
$f: \mathbb{A}^3 - \ell \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$, that takes a point $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ to $(x_1:x_2)$. As it turns out, $\tilde{X}$ is the closed set
of $\mathbb{A}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ given by
the equations $x_1 y_2 = x_2 y_1$. The exceptional set of $\tilde{X}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.

The correct answer is $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma^2}$.  It looks like some u-substitution work where $u = x_i-\mu$ and $du = -1$ so it's $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{u^2}{2\sigma^2}du$ which ends up being $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{2(x_i-\mu)}{2\sigma^2} \times (-1)$ it all cancels out but why does this still work when inside of a summation ? Usually when I do derivatives of summations, I have to incorporate the $n$ into the equation to rid myself of the summation operator. For example, 
$$\prod\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} = \bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\bigg)^n$$ The summation operator throws me off when it involves derivatives and the only way it makes sense to me is to restructure the format so that it doesn't include the summation operator.

1617746,Defining a Sum of Random Variables,"Given that a (real) random variable $X$ is a measurable map from a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$ to $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$, how do we define a sum of random variables $X+Y$? To elaborate, I've seen results which use random vectors and compositions of measurable maps to argue that $X+Y$ is a random variable, but it seems that the proof technique necessarily requires that $X,Y$ be defined on the same probability space. Intuitively this makes sense, since a sum of functions defined on different domains seems nonsensical. But then if we're given say, a Bernoulli random variable $X$ and a Gaussian Random variable $Y$, can we guarantee that there is a common probability space and variables $X,Y$ defined on that space such that $P_{X}(:=P\circ X^{-1})$ and $P_{Y}$ are Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions, respectively? Or, alternatively, can we use the convolution of probability measures to define $X+Y$ as any random variable with distribution $P_{X+Y}=P_{X}*P_{Y}$, since we seem to really only care about distributions, anyway?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability-distributions']"

1617776,Create parameterizable map between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$,"I would like to create a parameterizable map between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$.  This map I'll call $M$ and the parameter I'll call $k$.  $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ (but if there is a better space for $k$, I'm open to suggestions) $M(z, k) \rightarrow (x, y)$ $M^{-1}(x, y, k) \rightarrow z$ The requirements for $M$: $M$ and $M^{-1}$ are defined for all values in their domains For any $(x,y)$ there exists at least one set of values for $z$ and $k$ such that $M(z, k) = (x, y)$ My project (for those who care about why I want to do this) I'm a computer programmer, and I'm working on a side project (for fun).  My idea is that I want to build a model of an ""entity"" inside of an ""environment"". Entity Input: $z \in \mathbb{Z}$, $c \in \mathbb{R}, [0,1]$ Output: $z' = z + \Delta z$ $\Delta z$ is calculated based on an internal algorithm that isn't important to the question. Environment Internal State: $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ Input (Output From Entity): $z'$ Output (Input To Entity): $M^{-1}(M(z',k),k) = z$ and $c = e^{-|M(z',k)-p*|}$ ** $p*$ is the ""most content"" state of the environment ($p* = (x*,y*)). ** |...| denotes a distance measurement Note that $c$ can be any mapping between $[0, \infty] \rightarrow [1, 0]$ (sorry if that notation isn't conventional... 0 maps to 1, and $\infty$ maps to 0... and monotonically decreasing). The goal of my project is to build an entity to search it's own internal state-space to maximize the contentment value ($c$) it receives from the environment... but it receives a $\mathbb{Z}$ input and it's trying to find the output which maps to a specific value in environment's internal $\mathbb{Z}^2$ space... how it does this will depend on $M$, but I'm confident that I can solve that part if I can find an appropriate (hopefully non-trivial) $M$. The function $M^{-1}(x,y,k)$ maps a point $(x,y)$ to an integer $z$ which is input to the entity.  In a more ""real"" model, this would be like the entity's ""perspective"" of the environment. $k$ in my mind acts like a key , and the entity needs to find the key in order to ""solve"" the environment to achieve maximum contentment. My motivation and why I think this is interesting is that any environment that an entity ""lives in"" has more state than the possible perceptions that an entity has of that environment.  This is a naive attempt to model that observation.  In the future, I'd look to combine multiple entities which are able to ""solve"" this $\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^2$ environment setup to ""solve"" generally an environment setup of $\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^m$ Attempts to solve the problem My idea was that I needed some set of hashing functions $H_1$ and $H_2$ which act as an operator between two values in $\mathbb{Z}$.  The two functions I'd need are $H_1(z,k) = x$ and $H_2(z,k) = y$.  Then, I'd need to create inverse functions so that $M(H_1^{-1}(x,k), H_2^{-1}(y,k), k) = z$. In my existing simulation, I only require one hash from $\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and there is no $k$.  Introducing $k$ was tricky to me and I didn't see an obvious way to do it.",['functions']

Suppose I am asked to compute the probability that three successive tosses of a fair coin will have the same result.

However, suppose that I claim that the probability should be 1/2, and here is my reasoning: First, I point out that there are three coin tosses and only two possible outcomes for each toss.  Therefore, at least two out of the three tosses are guaranteed to have the same result.

1617806,Conditions for $x \mapsto x^k$ to be an automorphism,"I asked myself this question after I proved the following two exercises: (1) Prove that a mapping from $U(16)$ (the group of units) to itself given by $x\mapsto x^3$ is an automorphism. What about $x^5$ and $x^7$. Generalize. (2) Let $r\in U(n)$ (the group of units). Prove that the mapping $\alpha : Z_n \to Z_n$ defined by $s \mapsto rs$ is an automorphism. I generalised (1) as follows: (1G) The map $x \mapsto x^k$ is an automorphism of $U(n)$ if $\gcd(k,n)=1$. Then I thought that (1) and (2) are almost the same exercise except one is in additive notation while the other is in multiplicative. Except that not quite: Number (2) is about finite cyclic groups -- the easiest of all examples while (1) may not be cyclic, but definitely Abelian. So I started to wonder if one could generalise from these two and I came up with the following conjecture: Let $G$ be a finite Abelian group. Then the map $x \mapsto x^k$ is an
  automorphism of $G$ if and only if $k$ and $|G|$ are coprime. I had no trouble showing that if the order of $G$ and $k$ are coprime then this map is an automorphism: operation preserving is clear and if it's not injective then derive a contradiction. Done. But the other direction seems not so obvious. So now I'm trying to show that if $x\mapsto x^k$ is an automorphism then $k$ and $|G|$ are coprime (while wondering whether it's actually true). Is it true or am I trying to prove something false?",['group-theory']
