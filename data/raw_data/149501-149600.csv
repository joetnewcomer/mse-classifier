  $\rho$ not equivalent to $\tau$, then $(\chi_\rho|\chi_\tau) = 0$ If $\rho =  \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \rho_i $, and $\chi_\rho'$ is an
  irreducible character of a certain representation $\tau$, then the

Hence, $\chi_\rho = \chi_\tau$ $\boxed{\Leftarrow}$ Here I'm stuck. Can someone hint me in the right direction here?

2478540,How to use generalized pigeonhole principle to be sure that at least one of the integers picked is even?,"Q. How many integers from $0$ through $60$ must you pick in
  order to be sure of getting at least one that is odd? at least
  one that is even? Here is my verbal solution 'without using' pigeonhole principle. A. The list of integers $0,1,2...,60$ has $31$ even integers $30$ odd integers. So in order to be sure that at least one of the picked integers is odd, we must pick $32$ integers. This is because it may happen that first $31$ integers we pick turn out to be even. By similar argument, we find that if we pick $31$ integers from the list, then we are sure that at least one amongst them is even. Now I want to write this solution in terms of a function, pigeons and pigeonholes. Unfortunately the list of given integers contains total $61$ integers which is odd. Thus I can't take pigeonholes to be $\{0,1\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\},...,\{58,59\},\{60\}.$ The problem is that last element is a singleton set. I tried to use these pigeonholes as follows: Let $X$ denote the set of pigeons that are picked and $Y=\{A_1=\{0,1\},A_2= \{2,3\},A_3= \{4,5\},...,A_{30}=\{58,59\},A_{31}=\{60\}\}$ denote the set of pigeonholes. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function such that $f(x)=A_i$ whenever $x \in A_i.$ To be sure that at least one integer is odd : Suppose that we have picked $n$ number of pigeons. Then we are through when we find the least value of $n$ such that $\lceil \frac n{31} \rceil \ge 2$ (By generalized pigeonhole principle). Observe that $n=32$ fits the bill. Also $A_{31}$ is not the pigeonhole containing at least $2$ pigeons since the set $\{60\}$ has only one element. Thus one amongst the other pigeonholes must work out and we are sure that we have found at least one odd integer. However, this argument fails when we want to be sure that at least one integer is even. How should I think about pigeons and pigeonholes here? EDIT: Should I consider different pigeonholes for the case of picking at least one even integer? Specifically I would just change $A_{30}=\{58,59\}$ to $A_{30}=\{58,59,60\}$ and rule out $A_{31}$ for this case. Then the least value of $n$ such that $\lceil \frac n{30} \rceil \ge 2$ is $n=31.$ Here even if $A_{30}$ turns out to be the pigeonhole with at least $2$ pigeons we are sure that one of the pigeons is bound to be even since this pigeonhole has only one odd number viz $59$ in it.","['combinatorics', 'pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2478568,Simple Sturm-Liouville problem without square-integrable solutions.,"I know how to solve basic Sturm-Liouville problems of the form
$$
-(p f')' + q f = \lambda w f ,

but the following singular SP-Problem,
$$

$$
with $p=1$, $q = \log^2$, $\lambda=1$ and $w=\frac 1 x$, defined on the positive half-line $\mathbb{R}_+$, with boundary values $ f(0) = f(\infty) = 0 $, seems to evade my knowledge. I have found the solution
$$
f_1(x) = c_1 e^{-x\log(x) + x},
$$
without plugging in the boundary values just yet, and I know that there's a second linear independent one which may be found by the Spectral Parameter Power Series Method as
$$
f_2(x) = c_2 f_1(x) \int_0^x \frac{1}{p(t)(f_1(t))^2}\ dt
$$
but - contrary to Sturm-Liouville theory as I understand it - neither one is square integrable with respect to the measure $w dx = \frac{dx}{x}$, that is,
$$
\int_{0}^\infty (-f''(x) + \log^2(x) f(x)) \overline{f(x)}\ dx =\int_{0}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \frac{dx}{x}
$$ 
diverges, no matter the constants $c_1$, $c_2$. What's going on here - am I missing something fundamental? Aren't there any non-trivial solutions? Note that I also realize the parallels to the LHS of a SchrÃ¶dinger equation for a single particle in the potential $V = \log^2$, although the RHS of the equation is not a constant and thus cannot be interpreted as the energy of a system, but this does not contribute to my understanding.","['sturm-liouville', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'hilbert-spaces']"

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 6 years ago . Improve this question None of these are complete and I am looking for some guidance. In any ring if $ab=-ba$ then $(a+b)^2=(a-b)^2=a^2+b^2$. So assuming $ab=-ba$ to be true, then squaring both sides gives $(ab)^2=(-ba)^2$, i.e. $abab=-ba-ba$. Not all rings are commutative under multiplication so I don't know if I can assume that $abab =aabb=a^2b^2$. In any integral domain, if $a^2=b^2$ then $a=\pm b$ I'm not positive on how the integral domain plays a part in this one? Something to do with not having zero divisors I'm sure, possibly that no two elements multiplied together will give zero unless one of the elements is zero? So we can just take the square root In any integral domain, only 1 and -1 are their own multiplicative inverses. We must have a commutative ring with unity, thus we have a multiplicative inverse. Can we assume that 1 and -1 are the inverses? In any integral domain, if $a^n=0$ for some integer $n$ then $a=0$. Just thinking, the only time anything to a power is zero is when $0^n$ where $n\neq 0$, thus $a$ must be 0.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

2478700,Probabilistic Bounds for Balanced Random Walk,"For a balanced random walk with $2n$ steps, i.e. a walk that contains $n$ up-movements and $n$ down-movements, I'm trying to estimate some probabilistic results for the maximal deviation during the walk, i.e. how likely the walk is to stray far from the origin. This is akin to selecting from a bag of $2n$ balls, $n$ of which are red and $n$ of which are blue, without replacement. All walks must, of course, start and end at $(0,0$ and finish at $(2n,0)$. This is the same setup as the Ballot Problem with $p=q$. I'll define the maximal deviation $M$ by:

M: = \max_{1 \leq i \leq 2n}\left(\left| S_i\right|\right)

2478760,Are there some Python implementations of the Schwarz Christoffel mapping?,"I am interested in Python implementations of the Schwarz Christoffel mapping for simply and doubly connected polygonal domains. Well, I know that by now multiply connected domains can be dealt with, with the works of several authors (Tom DeLillo, Alan Elcrat, John Pfaltzgraff, and Darren Crowdy, to name a few). But to start with, I would like to know if someone has implemented some numerical algorithms in Python, similar (to some extent) to say the Schwarz-Christoffel Matlab toolbox, developed I think originally by Driscoll and Trefethen. For instance, one big issue is to find the preimages of the polygonal vertices, the so-called parameters of the mapping. This is non-trivial. There are also various numerical issues with branch cuts. These are some numerical issues that one has to deal with. Of course, the Matlab toolbox solves all these issues, but since I only have access now to Python, I would like to know if these have been implemented in Python. If not, I may be interested in trying to implement them. Edit: I was able to find some Python codes, to accomplish part of what I wanted, namely the programs linked to from http://planetmath.org/SchwarzChristoffelTransformationCircularVersion , in section 0.3. They seem to implement the mapping itself, when the ""preimages"" are also input. But they do not solve the issue of finding the actual preimages, that would produce a desired polygonal region. So this is good, but the tough part remains to be programmed, it seems. Update: I have now implemented the Schwarz-Christoffel forward mapping in Python. However, while finding the preimages, some preimages tend to cluster really close together, so much that they are practically indistinguishable, numerically speaking. Anyone knows how to solve this clustering issue? I have only read so far Trefethen's original algorithm. By reading a little bit one of Driscoll's articles on the Matlab SC-toolbox, it seems that the algorithm using cross-ratios and Delaunay triangulations handles well the crowding problem. The only problem is, it would take me some time to implement it. Using the more basic algorithm by Trefethen, and using the usual Gauss quadrature (rather than the more suitable Gauss-Jacobi one) but with smaller and smaller intervals as one approaches the preimages, I was only able to get conformal maps into rectangles of aspect ratios less than 5 approximately (at least this is the case with the current version of my Python code).","['complex-analysis', 'numerical-methods', 'conformal-geometry']"

I'm asking because of the curios memorylessness of the exponential distribution, which I understand like this. With $T$ an exponential variate with parameter $\lambda$ representing time till event $A$ occurs (like time until a bulb burns out), probability $\mathbb{P}\{T > t\} = e^{-\lambda \, t}$ is probability that $A$ doesn't occur till $t$. But if we know that $A$ hasn't occurred till $t$ then probability that $A$ doesn't occur till the additional time $X$ is the same: $\mathbb{P}\{X > t \, | \, T > t\} = e^{-\lambda \, t}$.

The most basic property of these matrices is, besides $\beta$ being diagonal, is $\alpha^2 = \beta^2 = \mathbb{I}_4$. We also have $\alpha \beta + \beta \alpha = 0$. This matrix exponential arises in the study of time propagation by the 1-D free Dirac equation in relativistic quantum mechanics, which reads
$$ i\hslash \partial_t \psi(p,t) = (c\alpha p + \beta mc^2) \psi(p,0),$$
where $\psi$ denotes the spinor in momentum space. This leads to the matrix exponential given above such that 
$$\psi(p,t) = \exp(-ic \alpha pt /\hslash - i\beta mc^2t/\hslash) \psi(p,0).$$ In the appendix of a publication [1], the solution is directly given by (with $\hslash = 1$)
$$\left( \mathbb{I}_4 cos(Et) - i\frac{c\alpha p + \beta mc^2}{E} sin(Et)\right), \quad E = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2 c^4},$$

2479240,Closed subsets of a compact metric space with distance zero from each other,"I am currently taking a Metric Spaces course, and during an activity, I had to prove the following result: Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space and $A,B \subset X$ two closed subsets such that $d(A,B)=0$. Then $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$. My reasoning was the following. Using the fact that $d(A,B) = 0$, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we may obtain $a_n \in A$ and $b_n \in B$ such that $d(a_n,b_n) < \frac1n$. This gives us two sequences $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset A$ and $(b_m)_{m \in \mathbb{N}}\subset B$ with the property that for every $\epsilon>0$, there is a natural number $n_0$ such that $d(a_n,b_n) < \epsilon$ for every $n \geq n_0$. From the compactness of $X$ we obtain a subsequence $(a_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $(a_n)$ which converges to some point $a \in X$. We know that in fact $a \in A$ because $A$ is closed. Now the claim is that $a \in A \cap B$. To show this, it is sufficient to show that $a \in \overline{B}$. For any real number $r>0$ we know that there exists an $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(a_n,b_n)< \frac r2$ for every $n \geq n_0$, and from the convergence of the subsquence $(a_{n_k})$, there exists and $n_{k_0} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(a,a_{n_k}) < \frac r2$ for every $n_k \geq n_{k_0}$. Then, taking any $n_k \geq \max\{n_0,n_{k_0}\}$ we have $$d(a,b_{n_k}) \leq d(a,a_{n_k})+d(a_{n_k},b_{n_k}) < \frac r2 + \frac r2 = r,$$ so that $b_{n_k}$ lies in the open ball of radius $r$ centered in $a$, thus showing that $a \in \overline{B}$. While I was discussing my attempt of proof with the person that was applying the activity, she claimed that it was not correct because I had to be more careful when using the indexes of the subsequence $(a_{n_k})$ to identify specific terms of the sequence $(b_n)$ as I did in the last inequality above. She argued that I should first consider the sequence $(b_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ with the same indices of the subsequence $(a_{n_k})$, obtain a convergent subsequence of $(b_{n_k})$ and then use this new subsequence during the proof. I didn't really understand why this would be necessary or what is the problem with the argument above. So I would like some help to know if what I did is correct, or to understand where is the problem if the proof happens to be wrong.

Let $\omega=B_1\setminus\{0\}$ and $W^{1,p}(\omega)$ the Sobolev space with the same $p<+\infty$ as before. The question is to show that $W^{1,p}(B_1)=W^{1,p}(\omega)$. I think that the question is to be intended as follows: show that for all $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ if $u\in W^{1,p}(\omega)$ and $\partial_i u$ is a weak derivative, then
$$\int_\omega u \,\partial_i\varphi=-\int_\omega\partial_iu\,\varphi,$$
since the converse (that is taking $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\omega)$ and $u\in W^{1,p}(B_1)$ and verify the definition of weak derivative) is trivial because $C^\infty_c(\omega)\subset C^\infty_c(B_1)$. I tried this: take $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ and $u\in W^{1,p}(\omega)$. Take the function $\eta\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ given by
$$\eta(x)=e^{\frac{|x|^2}{|x|^2-1}}$$
and consider the functions $\eta_r(x)=\eta(x/r)$ for $r\in(0,1)$ extended to zero outside the ball $B_r$. If my calculation are right we have:
$$\|\eta_r\|_p=\|\eta\|_p r^{\frac{2}{p}}$$
$$\|\nabla\eta_r\|_p=\|\nabla\eta\|_pr^{\frac{2}{p}-1}$$
Take $\psi_r\in C^\infty_c(B_1)$ a function such that $$\|\psi_r-\eta_r\|_{W^{1,p}}<r \qquad supp(\psi_r)=B_r \qquad \psi_r|_{B_{\epsilon(r)}}=1$$ for some $\epsilon(r)>0$ sufficiently small.
So the function $\tilde{\varphi}_r=\varphi-\psi_r\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\omega)$ is such that
$$\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0$$
$$\nabla\tilde{\varphi}_r\to\nabla\varphi \mbox{ in }L^p\qquad \mbox{as }r\to0\qquad \mbox{if } p<2$$
in fact for $p<2$ we have that $\eta_r\to0$ in $W^{1,p}(\omega)$. Now for all $r$ we have
$$\int_\omega u \,\partial_i\tilde{\varphi}_r=-\int_\omega\partial_iu\,\tilde{\varphi}_r,$$
then taking $\lim_{r\to0}$ we get the claim for $p<2$. My questions: Is my procedure right? What is a better proof in order to achieve the claim for all $p<+\infty$? SECOND: This should be more advanced. Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ open and let $K\subset\Omega$ closed such that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(K)=0$ where $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Show that $W^{1,p}(\Omega)=W^{1,p}(\Omega\setminus K)$ for $p<+\infty$ (in the same sense of the first question I think).

2479844,Two definitions of the tensor product and their relation,"I have seen two different definitions of the tensor product and I am asking about their relation. Definition (for modules in most abstract algebra books). Given two vector spaces $U$ and $V$ over $F$, the tensor product $T = U \otimes V$ is a vector space $T$ over $F$ together with a bilinear map $\pi : U \times V \to T$ such that every bilinear map on $U$ and $V$ factors through $T$ (by a unique linear map). This could easily be extended to the tensor product of an arbitrary but finite number of vector spaces. Definition (from Spivak, Calculus on Mainfolds and Munkres, Analysis on Mainfolds). Given a vector space $V$ over $F$, the $k$-fold tensor is the set of all multilinear maps from $V^k$ to $F$ (hence the tensor product of two spaces is the set of bilinear maps). What is the relation of Definition 1 and Definition 2? The first definition gives an isomorphism $\operatorname{Bilin}(U, V, F) \cong L(U \otimes V, F)$ as the correspondence giving the unique linear map is linear. In general this gives an isomorphism between the $k$-fold multilinear maps and the linear maps from the $k$-fold tensor product to $F$ (note that we have not used the property to its full extend, as it also holds for bilinear maps not having their image in $F$, but lets restrict to that case). But still this does not identifies the tensor product itself with the multilinear maps, but just those maps with the dual of the tensor product (which might in general not equal the tensor product itself)? When we start from Definition 2, I am not quite sure how to show the universal property from Definition one. So lets consider the $2$-fold tensor product of $V$ over $F$, then we have to show that $\operatorname{Bilin}(U,V, F)$ fulfills this (universal) property. The only possible way that comes to my mind is to define
$$
 \pi(u,v) = u^{\ast} \cdot v^{\ast}
$$
where $u^{\ast}$ and $v^{\ast}$ denote the correspoding dual elements of $V^{\ast}$ (after choosing a basis in $V$ and thereby having a dual basis in $V^{\ast}$ according to the usual construction, see here ). And if $\varphi : U \times V \to F$ is another bilinear map, we have to show that
$$
 \varphi(u,v) = h(u^*\cdot v^*)
$$
for a unique linear map, if we define $h$ that way (using that $u \mapsto u^{\ast}$ in injective) we could show that it is linear (using $\{ e_i^{\ast}\}$ and some computations). But in general $\{ u^{\ast} \mid u \in V \}\ne V^{\ast}$, so it is not clear to me how to extend $h$ to all of $\mbox{Bilin}(U,V,F)$, hence this only works in the case of reflexivity (which include the finite-dimensional vector spaces). So what I have done just works for reflexive vector spaces, but am I on the right track? Maybe there are simpler arguments, and Munkres does not restrict his definition to finite-dimensional vector spaces only, so does it makes sense to define the tensor product like in definition two, but then how does it relate to definition one?","['tensor-products', 'tensors', 'multilinear-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'definition']"

2479918,Alternative definition for tensor product which nowhere occurs (to my knowledge),"Every vector space $V$ could be embedded into $V^{\ast}$ (see here ) after choosing a basis, for a given vector $v \in V$ denote this embedding by $v^{\ast}\in V^{\ast}$. Now for given vector spaces $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ over some field $F$, let $V = \{ \varphi : V_1 \times \ldots \times V_k \to F \mbox{ multilinear } \}$. Why not define the tensor product 
of $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ simply as $T = \{ \varphi^{\ast} \mid \varphi\in V\}$. Then the universal property is obviously fulfilled, for if we
define $\pi : V_1 \times \ldots \times V_k \to T$ by $\pi(v_1, \ldots, v_k) = \Phi \in V^{\ast}$ with
$$
 \Phi(\varphi) = \varphi(v_1, \ldots, v_k).
$$
Then if we have some multilinear $\varphi : V_1 \times \ldots \times V_k \to F$ define the linear map $h_{\varphi} : T \to F$ by
$$
 h_{\varphi}(\Phi) = \Phi(\varphi)
$$
and we have
$$
 h_{\varphi}(\pi(v_1, \ldots, v_k)) = \varphi(v_1, \ldots, v_k)
$$
i.e. it factors through $T$ by $\pi$ and $h_{\varphi}$. Then everything works out quite easily, no nasty ""quotient constructions"", it even appears too simple for me... I have nowhere seen this definition? So why not define it that way? Have I overlooked something? Note that we do not rely on reflexivity here, as $T$ does not has to be all of $V^{\ast}$, but just those elements that arise from elements of $V$ (the image of the embedding). Maybe the universal property breaks down because the linear map is not unique, but I do not see other choices for it?","['tensor-products', 'tensors', 'multilinear-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'definition']"

Clearly, $|\{\frac{a}{b}\}| < |\{(a, b)\}|$ (the number of possible ratios is smaller than the number of possible ordered pairs), since for example $\frac{2}{1} = \frac{4}{2}$ but $(2, 1) \neq (4, 2)$. My question is: how much smaller is $|\{\frac{a}{b}\}|$ than $|\{(a, b)\}|$, as $N \to \infty$? Here's my approach so far: for any given $b$, we can determine how many $a$s get ""eliminated."" For example, if $b=2$, then $a=2, 4, 6, \ldots$ are all eliminated (because $\frac{2}{2}=\frac{1}{1}, \frac{4}{2}=\frac{2}{1}, \frac{6}{2}=\frac{3}{1}, \ldots$). So when $b=2$, $|\{\frac{a}{b}\}| = (1 - \frac{1}{2}) |\{(a, b)\}|$. The first few such ratios $r$ are: $b = 1 \implies r = 1$ $b = 2 \implies r = \frac{1}{2}$ $b = 3 \implies r = \frac{1}{3}$ $b = 4 \implies r = \frac{1}{2}$ $b = 5 \implies r = \frac{1}{5}$ $b = 6 \implies r = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}$ $b = 7 \implies r = \frac{1}{7}$ In other words, we find the prime factors $p_1, p_2, \ldots$ of $b$ and that reduces $|\{\frac{a}{b}\}|$ by $\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots - \left(\frac{1}{p_1}\right) \left(\frac{1}{p_2}\right) - \ldots$ So, we want to know the average $r$ for all $b$ (as $b \to \infty$).

where $Z\sim N(0,1)$. 
Let $p>0$. The continous mapping theorem then implies
$$|Y_n|^p \stackrel{d}{\to} |Z|^p.$$ I need to show that for any $p>0$. I have, as $n\to \infty$,
$$E(|Y_n|^p) \to E(|Z|^p).$$ I know that we need to show uniform integrability, which is implied if the following condition hold
$$\sup_{n}E(|Y_n|^{p+\epsilon})< \infty.$$ Does this hold for any $p>0$ in the given $i.i.d.$ case? Note that it is sufficient to check the condition either for even values of $p+\epsilon$ (eliminating the absolute value). For $p<2$ the statement is correct. We have
\begin{align*}
E(|Y_n|^2)& = E(\frac{1}{n} (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)^2)\\

since $E(X_iX_j)= E(X_i)E(X_j)=0$ for $p<4$ it should hold too: 
$(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)^4$ will contain $n$ summands of the form $X_i^4$, and $n(n-1)$ summands of the form $X_i^2X_j^2$  for all other summands there exists a $j$ such that the summand contains $X_j^1$ (hence the expectation of these terms will vanish again). It then would follow 
$$E(|Y_n|^4) \leq C \frac{n(n-1)}{n^2} < \infty$$ I tried a similar argument for $p=10$ and if I did not made any mistakes by looking at the cases, the largest numbers of terms entering the expectation of $(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i)^{10}$ should occure when any $5$ of the $n$ variables enter as a product of the form  $X_i^2 X_j^2 X_k^2 X_l^2 X_m^2$ for which there exists $n (n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4) \leq n^5$ possibilities. Hence: 
$$E(|Y_n|^{10}) \leq C \frac{n^5}{n^5} < \infty$$ My observations suggest that the claim holds for all $p>0$. And, chosing $p$ as an even number,  the largest number of terms entering the sum seem to be given by a factor of $n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-p/2-1)$.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-theory', 'statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'combinatorics']"

The problem comes from expanding the KÃ¤hler potential of the Grassmannian manifold in the vicinity of a certain point. Consider two matrices, $\{A^i_j\}_{N\times N}$ and $\{\tilde{A}^\alpha_\beta\}_{M\times M}$, defined as:
\begin{alignat}{9}
\begin{alignedat}{9}
A^i_j = \delta^i_j + \phi^i_\alpha\bar{\phi}^\alpha_j\\
\tilde{A}^\alpha_\beta = \delta^\alpha_\beta + \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i\phi^i_\beta

\begin{alignedat}{9}
i,j&=1\ldots N\\
\alpha,\beta&=1\ldots M
\end{alignedat}
\end{alignat}
Here bar denotes Hermitean conjugation. It's straightforward to show that $\operatorname{Tr{}} \ln(A) = \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} \ln(\tilde{A}) \equiv K$, where the tilde over the trace reminds that the trace is taken over the greek indices. Indeed, since the logarithm is defined through a series, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{Tr{}} \ln(A) = \operatorname{Tr{}} f_k (\phi^i_\alpha\bar{\phi}^\alpha_j)^k
    = f_k \operatorname{Tr{}} (\phi^i_\alpha\bar{\phi}^\alpha_j)^k
    = f_k \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} (\bar{\phi}^\alpha_i\phi^i_\beta)^k
    = \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} f_k (\bar{\phi}^\alpha_i\phi^i_\beta)^k
    = \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} \ln(\tilde{A})
\end{equation}
Here $f_k$ are the coefficients in the Taylor expansion on the logarithm. As I am constructing the small-$\phi$ expansion of the following quantity (the generalisation of the Fubini-Study metric):
$$
G_{i\beta}^{j\alpha}=
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\phi^i_\alpha}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\bar{\phi}_j^\beta} K
$$
Depending on which definition of $K$ I'm using, I'm getting different results. The definition above renders:
\begin{alignat}{9}
{}^{(I)}G_{i\beta}^{j\alpha}&=\operatorname{Tr{}} (A^{-1}) \delta_i^j \delta^\alpha_\beta
- \operatorname{Tr{}}(A^{-2}) \phi^j_\beta \bar{\phi}_i^\alpha \\
{}^{(II)}G_{i\beta}^{j\alpha}&=\tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} (\tilde{A}^{-1}) \delta_i^j \delta^\alpha_\beta
- \tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}}(\tilde{A}^{-2}) \phi^j_\beta \bar{\phi}_i^\alpha
\end{alignat}
OK, looks like the quantities $\operatorname{Tr{}} (A^{-1})$  and $\tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} (\tilde{A}^{-1})$ should coincide. However:
\begin{alignat}{9}
(A^{-1})^i_j &\approx \delta^i_j - \phi^i_\alpha \bar{\phi}^\alpha_j \\
(\tilde{A}^{-1})^\alpha_\beta &\approx \delta^\alpha_\beta - \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i  \phi^i_\beta
\end{alignat}
Which gives for the traces:
\begin{alignat}{9}
\begin{alignedat}{9}
\operatorname{Tr{}} (A^{-1}) &= N - \phi^i_\alpha \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i \\
\tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} (\tilde{A}^{-1}) &= M - \phi^i_\alpha \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i
\end{alignedat}
\quad,\qquad
\begin{alignedat}{9}
\operatorname{Tr{}} (A^{-2}) &= N - 2\phi^i_\alpha \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i \\
\tilde{\operatorname{Tr{}}} (\tilde{A}^{-2}) &= M - 2\phi^i_\alpha \bar{\phi}^\alpha_i

For each $\epsilon > 0$, show that there is a measurable set $F$ contained in $E$ such that $f$ is bounded on $F$ and $m(E-F) < \epsilon$. Let $f : E \to \Bbb{R}$ and $E$ be as stated in the hypothesis. Since $f$ is finite almost everywhere, there exists an $E_0 \subseteq E$ for which $m(E_0) = 0$ and $f$ is finite over $E-E_0$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Then there exists a closed set $C$ contained in $E$ such that $m(E-C) < \epsilon$. Note that $E-(C-E_0) = E_0 \cup (E-C)$ which implies $m(E-(C-E_0)) \le m(E_0) + m(E-C) < \epsilon$. Let $F = C-E_0$. Then $f$ will not be infinite over $C$, but it still could be unbounded; so it remains to show that it is bounded on $C$. By way of contradiction, suppose that $f$ is unbounded. Then for every $n \in \Bbb{N}$, there exists an $x_n \in C$ such that $|f(x_n)| \ge n$. Since $C$ and $E_0$ are measurable subsets of $E$, over which $f$ is a measurable function, $f$ is also measurable over $C-E_0 = F$. Moreover, since $|~|$ is continuous, the composition $|~| \circ f$ is measurable over $F$. Therefore, for every $n$, the measurable set $\{x \in F \mid |f(x)| \ge n \}$ is nonempty. This is where I get stuck...I feel like there is a contradiction lurking somewhere but I cannot spot it. I was trying to argue that the intersection $\bigcap_{n \in \Bbb{N}} \{x \in C \mid |f(x)| \ge n \} = \{x \in C \mid |f(x)| = \infty \}$ is not empty, which would give the desired contradiction, but this is very unlikely...I could use a hint.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

Probability of an event that has happened, to have happened in a specific time range? Calculate probability of an event occurring exactly once in an arbitrarily selected year, given mean annual occurrences over a century Suppose I take ""samples"" of the environment in hopes of detecting something. I have a model that tells me the probability an event will occur at least once sometime between 7:00am and 8:00am. Suppose this probability is 0.25, and is based on an hourly weather prediction -- so my predictive model is only good to the hour. However, I can only take samples in scheduled chunks of one minute. Assuming perfect detection, what's my probability of detecting the event of interest if I sample any SINGLE random minute out of the hour? What is my probability of detecting this event if I can randomly sample 2,3,4,5... or any N <= 60 minutes out of this hour? I was thinking it would make sense for my problem to spread this 0.25 probability uniformly between the 60 minutes since I only have hourly resolution. So if I can only sample 1 minute out of the hour, probability of the event occurring at least once in THAT minute is 0.25*1/60. If I can sample 2 minutes out of the hour, total probability of the event occurring at least once during those minutes is 0.25*2/60. Three minutes would be 0.25*3/60 and so on. Alternatively, I know it might be more conventional to say: 1-((1-0.25/60)^N) for calculating the probability of this event happening at least once across N sampled minutes, but this feels less intuitive for me within the context of a disconnect between the time scales. Perhaps either approach is fine depending on the system assumptions. Regardless,  is it okay to divvy up that 0.25 hourly probability among the 60 minutes the way I have done, or does this violate something basic in probability theory? (If it helps provide context, the events I'm trying to detect are bird songs! I don't care about rates (Poisson), I just care about presence or absence of singing in a given sampled minute.)",['probability']

Let $x\in X$ be a recurrent point for the G-action, which means there exist $g_n\neq e$ such that $g_n x\to x$ as $n\to\infty$. Let $y\in \overline{Gx}\setminus Gx$, where $Gx=\{gx:g\in G\}$ is the $G$-orbit of $x$. I'd like to show that $Gx$ and $Gy$ (which are distinct points of the quotient) cannot be separated (in $X/G$) in the $T_0$ sense.

It follows that $Gx\in V$. I'm having trouble proving that, if $V\subset X/G$ is open and $Gx\in V$, then $Gy\in V$. I've not yet used the fact that $x$ is a recurrent point, so I'm guessing that's somehow involved. It would suffice to show that $gy\in V$ for some $g\in G$, which seems reasonable since there are points of the form $gx$ arbitrarily close to $y$ in $X$, but I don't see how to go from a neighborhood of $x$ to one of $y$. The main issue seems to be showing that points of the $G$-orbit of $x$ cannot approach the boundary to $\bigcup V$. Equivalently, we would be showing that there exists a $G$-invariant set $W$ with $x\in W$ and $\overline{W}\subset \bigcup{V}$. EDIT: I forgot to add, the existence of $y\in \overline{Gx}\setminus Gx$ is guaranteed by the fact that $x$ is recurrent, so this fact has actually been used at an onset. For, if $x$ is recurrent, then so is every point of $Gx$, and thus $\overline{Gx}$ is perfect, hence uncountable, since $X$ is Polish.

I'm well aware that this question has been asked before. But no one has ever posted a complete answer, only some really general hints. Is the following proof all-right? Attempt: Given any $a,b\in M$, we must exhibit $h:M\rightarrow M$ homeomorphism such that $h(a)=b$. Define the following set: $H=\{x\in M$: exists $h:M\rightarrow M$ homeomorphism satisfying $h(x)=b\}$. Note that this set is non-empty, since $a\in H$ (by identity). We prove that this set is clopen. Take any $x_0\in H$ (and let $\varphi$ be the homeomorphism such that $\varphi(x_0)=b$). Since $M$ is topological manifold, there exists an open $V\ni x_0$ such that $\phi:V\rightarrow A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphism, where $A$ is open. Let $B=B[\phi(x_0)]\subset\mathbb{R^n}$ be any closed ball. $\phi$ is homeomorphism, so $T = \phi^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $M$ containing $x_0$. Define $\overline\phi : T \rightarrow B$ as $\overline \phi = \phi|_T$. Notice that $\beta = \overline \phi (x_0)\in \mbox{int}B$ and consider $\overline x \in T$ such that $\overline \phi(\overline x) \in \mbox{int}B.$ We find an homeomorphism $f:T\rightarrow T$ such that $f(x_0)=\overline x$.  By a lemma, exists $g:B\rightarrow B$ homeomorphism such that $g$ is equal to the identity in $\partial B$ and such that $g(\beta)=\alpha$. Take $f = (\overline \phi)^{-1} \circ g \circ \overline \phi $. Hence $f$ is homeomorphism as a composition of homeomorphisms and such that it is identity in $\partial B$, and $f(x_0)=\overline x.$ Define $h:M \rightarrow M$ by $h(x) = f(x)$ if $x\in T$, and $h(x)=x$ otherwise. By another lemma we guarantee $h$ homeomorphism. Now we notice that $\varphi \circ h^{-1}$ is homeomorphism  such that $\varphi(h^{-1}(\overline x))= b$.  Therefore, $\overline x \in H$ and this proves that $H$ is open. Now we prove that $H^C$ is open. Suppose not. Then exists $y_0$ such that for all $V$ neighborhood $V\ni y_0$ exists points of $H$. Let $U$ be the neighborhood such that it is homeomorphic to an open in $\mathbb{R^n}$. By the argument used before, we guarantee a closed set, which contains $y_0$ and  is contained in $U$. We notice that this closed set must contain a point of $H$ in its interior. Again by another argument used before it follows that $y_0\in H$, a contradiction. Therefore, $H$ is clopen. Since $M$ is connected and $H\neq \emptyset$, it follows that $H=M$.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

Part (b) asks to show that in the special case where $c(u) \equiv 1$, the origin is asymptotically stable. My attempt: For part (a), consider the function (taken from Khalil's Nonlinear systems, p. 184)
$$V(u,u'):=\int_0^{u} g(v) \mathrm{d} v+\frac{1}{2} u'^2 $$
in a domain where $|u|<\delta$ is small enough so that $ug(u)>0$ for $0 \neq |u|<\delta$. We have
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} V(u(t),u'(t)) =g(u)u'+u' u''=u'(-c(u)u')=-c(u) u'^2 \leq 0. $$
Hence $V$ is a Lyapunov function, and solutions remain in the interior of the contour lines of $V$ if they start with sufficiently small $|u|$. For part (b), using the same Lyapunov function we get
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} V(u(t),u'(t))=-u'^2 \leq 0 $$
with equality happening if and only if $u'=0$. However, at such points we see that $$u''=-g(u) $$ so that the first derivative of $u$ changes sign every time it becomes zero.

For instance, Let: $\frac{du}{dx}=\frac{du}{dt}$ . we can apply the Fourier transform once with respect to $x$ and thus we have: $(is)F(y)(s,t)=\frac{dF(y)(s,t)}{dt}$ where $F(y)(s)$ is the Fourier of $y$ taking it from the spacial $x$ domain to the frequency $s$ domain. We can now repeat this process but taking the transform from the temporal domain to some new domain $k$ . Thus we have: $(is)F[F(y)](s,k)=(ik)F[F(y)](s,k)$ . as can be seen, this is now a Algebraic Equation, and by applying the inverse Fourier twice, we could arrive at our original function.

2481040,Two probabilities of the same thing,"Consider this minesweeper situation. The 3 I've circled tells us that there is a mine in one of A, B and C. So, this means the probability that the mine is in A is $\frac{1}{3}$. And the 4 I've circled (and the 2 below it) tells that there is a mine in A or D. This makes the probability of finding a mine in A = $\frac{1}{2}$. So, how to combine these two probabilities to get the actual probability of finding a mine in A? I thought of this: There are two possibilities: Either there is a single mine in A or there is one mine in D and one in B or C. These two possibilities are equally likely, I guess. So, the probability that there's a mine in A is $\frac{1}{2}$. If that was correct, then is there any other approach to this? EDIT: Also, the circled 3 tells that that the probability that a mine is in B or C=$\frac{2}{3}$. But if we consider the 3 to the right of the circled 3, it tells us that there is a single mine in one of B,C,E and F, which makes the probability of finding a mine in B or C=$\frac{1}{2}$. Again, there are two probabilities of finding a mine in B or C.",['probability']
2481049,What will happen if a sequence of rectangles with decresing diameter tends to a point?,"I am studying complex analysis, particularly different versions of Cauchy's theorem. Now while going through the proof of Cauchy's theorem for rectangles I found a concept that a sequence of rectangles with decreasing diameter tends to a point of the initial rectangle I have started with. I know the the concept of sequence in metric spaces where sequence of points of the space tends to some point in that space or some extended space. But how can I relate this concept to above when some nested sets with decreasing diameter tends to a point. What I have thought about it is as follows $:$ Suppose $\{R_n \}$ be nested sequence of rectangles in the complex plane with $\mathrm{diam} (R_n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Then since $(\mathbb C, ||\ .||_2)$ is complete so by Cantor's intersection theorem we have $\cap_{n=1}^{\infty} R_n = \{z^* \}$.  I think it means to say that for a given $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists$ $k \in \mathbb N$ such that $\forall n \geq k$ we have $||z-z^*|| < \epsilon$ for all $z \in R_n$. Is it the correct interpretation of such a convergence? I am not sure of that. Please check it. Thank you in advance.","['complex-analysis', 'complex-integration']"
2481087,Independence vs Marginal independence,"I known that for give $x,y$ , if we have $$p(x,y)=p(x)p(y)$$ Then we call $x,y$ are independent. For marginal independence, I found the definition here . Random variable $x$ is marginal independent of random variable $y$ if: $$p(x|y)=p(x)$$ However, I cannot see the difference between them. The question come to my mind when I want to figure out a question about Bayesian network.
In 3-way Bayesian network, there are three nodes A,B,C in a common parent struct. A  
  | |  
 B   C A is the parent of B and C. It says B and C are conditional independent given A, and I can see it because: $$P(B|A,C)=\frac{P(A,B,C)}{P(A,C)}\\=\frac{P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A)}{P(A,C)}\\=P(B|A)$$ But , when the value of A is unknown, why $B,C$ are not independent?","['independence', 'bayesian-network', 'probability']"
