144703,Existence of irreducible polynomials over finite field,"Let $F$ be a finite field. How do we prove that for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$? One can assume that $F = \mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ where $p$ is prime. If $n \ge |F|$ then I can construct an irreducible polynomial, namely $ p(x) = 1 + \prod_{j=1}^{|F|} ( x - a_j )$ where $a_j$ are all the field elements. It is clear that $p(x)$ has no roots in $F$. This trick doesn't work for $n < |F|$. A counter-example: Let $F = \mathbb{F}_3$ and $p(x) = 1 + (x-1)(x-2)$, then $p(1) = 1$, $p(2) = 1$, $p(0) = 1 + (-1)(-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 = 0 \pmod 3$. I know there is a way to count them using the Möbius function $\mu(n)$ but I want a proof without it that just shows existence.","['finite-fields', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'field-theory', 'number-theory']"
144709,"Proof via Group Theory : $\mathrm{lcm}(a,b) \cdot \gcd(a,b) = |ab|$","Recently, I was informed that we can verify the famous formula about $\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ and $\gcd(a,b)$ which is $$\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{|ab|}{\gcd(a,b)} $$ via group theory. The least common multiple of two integers $a$ and $b$, usually denoted by $\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)$ , is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$ and the greatest common divisor ($\gcd$) , of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder.

144797,What is the relationship between generalized functions and things like the Riesz representation theorem?,"I just watched this video of Prof. Osgood's lecture on Fourier Transforms, and it seems to me that there's some connection between his talk of distributions (generalized functions) and the usual linear algebra I'm familiar with. He mentions many times that the dirac delta function classically doesn't make any sense. I agree with him, but then he shows that one can represent the dirac delta function as a continuous linear functional. I'm a bit confused, because the Riesz representation theorem says that elements of a Hilbert space $H$ correspond bijectively with continuous linear functionals on $H$. So there must be some function that actually does everything we want out of the dirac delta function, right? I think the difference here is that the chosen measure is also part of the equation, but I haven't quite put my finger on it. So my question is: what part of the Riesz representation theorem fails for this?","['distribution-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'riesz-representation-theorem']"
144798,Finding Eigenvectors with repeated Eigenvalues,"I have a matrix $A = \left(\begin{matrix} -5 & -6 & 3\\3 & 4 & -3\\0 & 0 & -2\end{matrix}\right)$ for which I am trying to find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In this case, I have repeated Eigenvalues of $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = -2$ and $\lambda_3 = 1$. After finding the matrix substituting for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, I get the matrix $\left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & -1\\0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\end{matrix}\right)$ after row-reduction. To find the result of $\left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & -1\\0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\end{matrix}\right)$ $\left(\begin{matrix} e_1\\e_2\\e_3\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix} 0\\0\\0\end{matrix}\right)$, I set $e_2$ and $e_3$ as free variables $s$ and $t$, respectively, solved for $e_1$ and put into vector form: $$\left[\begin{matrix} -2s + t\\s\\t\end{matrix}\right] = s \left[\begin{matrix} -2\\1\\0\end{matrix}\right] + t \left[\begin{matrix}1\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right]$$ So for the first two Eigenvectors, I found $v_1 = [-2, 1, 0]^{T}$ and $v_2 = [1, 0, 1]^T$. However, checking my answer on Wolfram Alpha, $v_1$ is assigned to the latter and $v_2$ is assigned to the former. Does this matter? If so, should I instead find the first Eigenvector for $\lambda_1$ then using the same reduced matrix set it equal to the result of $v_1$ instead of the zero vector for $\lambda_2$? I.e., solving the above matrix for $\lambda_1$:
$$e_1 = -2e_2 + e_3 \rightarrow  1 = -2(0) + 1 $$
$$v_1 = [1, 0, 1]^T$$ And then for $\lambda_2$: $$\left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & -1\\0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} e_1\\e_2\\e_3\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix} 1\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right)$$ However, using $e_3$ as a free variable where $e_3 = 0$, I don't get the above vector I originally found for $v_1$: $$e_1 + 2e_2 = 1 \rightarrow 1(2) + 2(-1/2) = 1$$

It seems intuitive that any subgroup of a finite solvable group is necessarily solvable, as well. Is this true in general? For normal subgroups? How can I go about proving this result?

144825,MA process ACF proof - don't understand it,"I've got the proof but I don't understand a small detail. As you know for an MA process: $X_n = \sum _{i=0} ^q \beta_i Z_{n-i}$ where $Z_n$ is WGN (pure Gaussian random process). Then the ACF is: $\gamma(k) = Cov(\sum _{i=0} ^q \beta_i Z_{n-i}, \sum _{j=0} ^q \beta_j Z_{n-j + k}) = \sum _{i=0} ^q \sum _{j=0} ^q \beta_i \beta_j Cov(Z_{n-i}, Z_{n-j+k}) = \sum _{i=0} ^q \sum _{j=0} ^q \beta_i \beta_j Cov(Z_n, Z_{n +i-j+k})$ But because $\{Z_{n+i}\}$ is iid wrt i then: $Cov(Z_n, Z_{n +i-j+k}) = 0$ for $k + i - j \neq 0$
and $Cov(Z_n, Z_{n +i-j+k}) = \sigma_z ^2$ for $k + i - j = 0$. So: $\gamma(k) = \sigma_z ^2 \sum _{i=0} ^q \sum _{j=0} ^q \beta_i \beta_j$ But the book says this equals: $\sigma_z ^2 \sum_{i=0} ^{q-k} \beta_i \beta_{i+k}$ . For some reason I can't see how.

145020,Affine form of a dual to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem?,"The following question came up in the course of this recent question . Let $S$ be a set of lines in the real affine plane, with the following properties $S$ is finite, there are at least two points in which some pair of lines from $S$ intersect. Does this imply that there is at least one point where exactly two lines of $S$ intersect? Another way of formulating this is: assuming $S$ is finite, and that whenever two lines of $S$ intersect there is at least one more line of $S$ passing throught the point of intersection; does it follow that the lines of $S$ are either all parallel or all pass through a single point? The statement is true in the real projective plane; this is a result due to E. Melchior (1940) that can be proved by counting intersection points, line segments and faces of the line arrangement, and the known Euler characterisitic of the projective plane. In fact the proof, cited here , shows that there are at least three ""ordinary"" points of intersection (where two but no more lines of $S$ intersect). However, applying this to a configuration in the affine plane, it is conceivable that these ordinary points are all at infinity, and so only correspond to a pair of parallel lines in $S$ rather than to an ordinary point of affine intersection. If one could show that projectively there are at least three non collinear ordinary points, then this would prove the affine form; however it would seem unlikely that the proof by Euler characteristic leads to such a sharpening. Should all ordinary points be at infinity, then one can make them non-ordinary by adding the line at infinity to the configuration, but this could introduce new ordinary points at infinity, and this does not seem to give the desired result. Directly applying the Euler characterisitc argument to the affine configuration seems hard as well, since there can for instance be a large number of faces bounded by only two segments. So it could be that the affine result is false, but trying to construct a counterexample certainly suggests it is true. One configuration with only a single ordinary point consists of  the four sides of a parallelogram and its two diagonals. Adding more lines to the configuration appears to inevitably make things worse, but I can see no simple reason why it necessarily should. I'd finally like to note, to explain my title, that the dual result is known as the Sylvester-Gallai theorem : it says that for any finite collection of points not all on the same line there is at least one line that contains exactly two of them. This result does not suffer from a distinction between the affine and projective case: the affine case implies the projective one by choosing a line meeting none of the points as line at infinity, and the projective case implies the affine case because for a finite collection of points in the affine plane, the line containing two of them, which the projective version of the result gives, obviously cannot be the line at infinity.",['geometry']

$$ My doubt come from the fact that $X$ as a sum of i.i.d has to tend to a $\alpha$-stable distribution.
The generic exponent $\alpha$ of a generic $\alpha$-stable distribution can lay only in the range $(0,2]$, that imply $1<k\le 3$. But if we try to use the rule of Fourier transform for the sum of i.i.d. random variables (namely the convolution is the product of the Fourier transforms) as power law we can get an arbitrary big exponent $k$ (isn't it?).

145085,Holomorphic Automorphism Group,"By a domain I mean an open connected subset of ${\mathbb C}$. If $D$ is a domain, let $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ denote the collection of holomorphic bijections $f:D\to D$. It is well-known that if $f$ is holomorphic, so is its inverse, so $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is actually a group. We can give a topology to $H(D)$, the set of holomorphic maps with domain $D$, by setting $f_n\to f$ iff $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on any compact subset of $D$. This actually makes $H(D)$ a complete metric space (Section 2.2 of Berenstein-Gay "" Complex variables ""). I have a few questions about $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ with this topology. First, Is $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ a topological group? It is easy to check that $f_n\circ g_n\to f\circ g$ if $f_n\to f$ and $g_n\to g$ in $H(D)$, so the question here is whether $f_n^{-1}\to f^{-1}$ if $f_n\to f$, and $f_n,f\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$. (This may be trivial.) Second, If $f_n\to f$ in $H(D)$ and $f_n\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$ for all $n$, is $f\in \operatorname{Aut}(D)$ as well? Are there any reasonable assumptions on $D$ that make this true? (As pointed out in the comments below, if $D$ is simply connected, then $f$ needs not be injective.) By Rouche, we have that $f$ is either constant or injective (Prop 2.6.19 in Berenstein-Gay ""Complex Variables""). Perhaps, if it is injective, showing it is surjective should be easy? Finally, I've heard that $\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ is actually a Lie group. I suppose the topology is the one I mentioned, but I do not see where the manifold structure will come from if that's the case.

Suppose that $u\colon\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R$ is a continuous function such that at every point $(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2$ at least one of the following is true: the partial derivative $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ exists and is equal to $0$. the partial derivative $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ exists and is equal to $0$. Does it follow that $u$ depends only on one of two variables $x,y$? In other words, can we prove that either 1 holds for all points or 2 holds for all points? So far I can prove this only under the additional assumption $u\in C^1$. Edit: Here is a proof of the $C^1$ case. Claim 1: If $u_x(a,b)\ne 0$ for some $(a,b)$, then $u_x(a,y)=u_x(a,b)$ for all $y\in\mathbb R$. Claim 2: If $u_y(c,d)\ne 0$ for some $(c,d)$, then $u_y(x,d)=u_y(c,d)$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$. Once Claims 1 and 2 are proved, it follows that the premise of one of them never holds, otherwise both derivatives would be nonzero at $(a,d)$. By symmetry it suffices to prove Claim 1. The set $E=\{y\in\mathbb R\colon u_x(a,y)=u_x(a,b)\}$ is closed by the continuity of $u_x$. Also, if $t\in E$ then $u_x\ne 0$ in some neighborhood of $(a,t)$ (again by continuity), which by assumption yields $u_y=0$ in this neighborhood, meaning $u$ does not depend on $y$ there. Thus, $E$ is also open. We conclude with $E=\mathbb R$, proving the claim.",['real-analysis']

  distribution we have
  $\mu=E[X_j]=\left(\frac{1}{2^m},\cdots,\frac{1}{2^m}\right)^T$ and so $$\mathbf{Z}_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{j=1}^n [\mathbf{X}_j-E(\mathbf{X}_j)] = \sqrt{n} (\overline{X}_n -\mu)$$ for non-overlapping case, by the Central Limit Theorem, since each

145808,Does local convexity imply global convexity?,"Question: Under what circumstances does local convexity imply global convexity? Motivation: Classically, a twice differentiable function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if the second derivative is nonnegative everywhere. In this recent question, Derivative of Convex Functional , it's shown that the same result holds for twice Frechet differentiable functionals on Banach spaces, $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In both these cases, we have a result saying something to the effect of: "" local convexity implies global convexity "". How far can this idea be generalized? The following hypothesis, which may or may not be true, expresses the idea in the most general context I can think of. Conjecture: Let $C$ be a connected subset of a topological vector space , and let $\{ U_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}$ be an open cover of the boundary $\partial C$. If $U_\alpha \cap C$ is convex for all $\alpha \in A$, then $C$ is convex. Informally, ""Inspect the boundary of a connected set with a (variable-size) magnifying glass. If, everywhere you look, it looks convex, then the set is globally convex."" Example: $C$ is a square in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $U_\alpha=B_i$ are balls covering all 4 edges and corners. Non-example: $C$ is two disjoint disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$. From this we see that there is a topological element to the question - if the connectedness condition is relaxed, it's easy to come up with counterexamples. Notes: I've linked the key terms to the wiki pages. Is this good style on M.SE? Most people who could answer the question would already know the definition. On the other hand, when I'm answering a question that's not immediately obvious, a lot of times I'll open up the wiki page and look around even if I already know the definition. A special case I've been considering is where the space is Banach, and the set's boundary is path connected and compact. In this case I think it's true but the proof is elusive so far.. In the comments Chris Eagle suggests reducing it to a 2D problem. I'm not sure exactly how this works and if it will generalize to spaces other than $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the comments Cardinal notes that it is trivally false in the discrete topology - the boundary of any set can be covered by open points. Joriki points out that this isn't a problem since all nontrivial sets of interest are not connected in the discrete topology. George Lowther notes that the conjecture is false in $\mathbb{R}^2$ unless a further constraint is added that the set is either closed or open.

If $\phi:A\rightarrow A'$ and $\psi:B\rightarrow B'$ are $S$-module homomorphisms, is it true that $$\operatorname{im}(\phi\otimes\psi)=\operatorname{im}(\phi)\otimes_S \operatorname{im} (\psi)?$$","['homological-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'tensor-products']"
145820,Connection of ideas of Measuring to the Measure theory .,"Consider a point in a line, it has length zero . Consider a line in a plane , it has area zero . Consider a Plane in $\mathbb R^3$  it has $0$ volume . My question is , is there a measure theoretic way of extracting these ideas ? How can i link these ideas with Measure theory ?",['measure-theory']
145863,Solving the equation: $p^a (1-p)^b = q^a (1-q)^b$,"I am currently studying the following equation: $p^a(1-p)^b=q^a(1-q)^b$ where $p,q \in (0,1)$, and $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. I would like to show that the equation is satisfied if and only if $p=q$. Is it possible to do this in an exact way? I came across this equation when studying dynamical systems, and I don't have much of a background with these sorts of equations. (Actually, more precisely, I would like to show that $\sum_k (p^{a_k}(1-p)^{b_k}  - q^{a_k}(1-q)^{b_k}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q$ for $p,q \in (0,1)$ and $a_k,b_k \in \mathbb{N}$.)

145869,A finite-dimensional vector space cannot be covered by finitely many proper subspaces?,"Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space, $V_i$ is a proper subspace of $V$ for every $1\leq i\leq m$ for some integer $m$. In my linear algebra text, I've seen a result that $V$ can never be covered by $\{V_i\}$, but I don't know how to prove it correctly. I've written down my false proof below: First we may prove the result when $V_i$ is a codimension-1 subspace. Since $codim(V_i)=1$, we can pick a vector $e_i\in V$ s.t. $V_i\oplus\mathcal{L}(e_i)=V$, where $\mathcal{L}(v)$ is the linear subspace span by $v$. Then we choose $e=e_1+\cdots+e_m$, I want to show that none of $V_i$ contains $e$ but I failed. Could you tell me a simple and corrected proof to this result? Ideas of proof are also welcome~ Remark : As @Jim Conant mentioned that this is possible for finite field, I assume the base field of $V$ to be a number field.",['linear-algebra']
