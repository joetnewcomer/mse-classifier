1457259,What is the difference between a multivariate function and a vector-valued function?,"I am not sure how to distinguish between a multivariate function and a vector-valued function when they are defined. For example, if I define a function as $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, how do I know whether it's defining something like $f(x, y) = x + 2y$ or $\vec{v}(x, y) = (x + y)\hat{i} + (x - y)\hat{j}$?","['vectors', 'functions']"

Give an example of a function that is sequentially continuous but not continuous. I tried letting $X$ be $\mathbb R$ with cofinite topology and $Y$ be $\mathbb R$ with discrete topology where $f$ is identity map but $f$ is neither sequential continuous or continuous. There are no simple solutions online since most use ordinal sets and we have not yet covered that in our topology class.","['sequences-and-series', 'general-topology']"
1457270,Representation theorem for local martingales,"I want to prove the following local martingale representation theorem. For the statement of the theorems to come we fix a filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is the augmented Brownian filtration generated by a (for simplicity 1D) Brownian motion $W$. The theorem I want to prove is the following:
Let $M$ be a local martingale on $[0,T]$. Then there is a progressively measurable process $\phi$ satisfying $\int_0^T\phi(s)^2 ds<\infty$ a.s. such that $$M(t)=M(0)+\int_0^T\phi(s)dW(s)$$ For the proof I am basically only allowed to use the following martingale representation theorem for $L^2$-martingales:
Let $M$ be an $L^2$-martingale on $[0,T]$. Then there is a progressively measurable process $\phi\in L^2(\lambda\otimes\mathbb{P})$ such that
$$M(t)=M(0)+\int_0^T\phi(s)dW(s).$$ In the case that I a priori that my local martingale above is continuous I was able to find a reducing sequence of stopping times which makes the emerging stopped processes bounded: Use $\tau_k:=\inf\left\{t\in[0,T]: |M(t)|>k\right\}\wedge T$. Hence I am in the setting of the result I am allowed to use.
I am also pretty sure that this approach also works for left-continuous processes. But what about the general case? Is there a way to find a reducing sequence which yields $L^2$-martingales as resulting stopped processes?

1457308,"If $\frac{p_{n+1}}{np_n} \to p > 0 $, then $\sqrt[n+1]{p_{n+1}}-\sqrt[n]{p_{n}} \to \frac{p}{e}$","Problem:
Prove that,
if a sequence
${p_n}$
satisfies
$p_n > 0$
and
$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}
\frac{p_{n+1}}{np_n} = p > 0
$,
then
$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}
\left(\sqrt[n+1]{p_{n+1}}-\sqrt[n]{p_{n}} \right)
=\frac{p}{e}
$. This lemma occurs 
in problem B-1151
in the current Fibonacci Quarterly
(August 2015)
with a reference to a paper
published by the
University of Belgrade
and not written in English. It is used to prove things like
$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}
\left(\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!F_{n+1}}-\sqrt[n]{n!F_{n}} \right)
=\frac{\alpha}{e}
$
where
$\alpha
=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}
$. This looks like an interesting result,
so I thought that
I would try to prove it.
Here is my attempt. We have
$\frac{p_{n+1}}{np_n} 
\to p
$.
If this was
$\frac{p_{n+1}}{(n+1)p_n} 
\to p
$,
this could be divided by
$\frac{n!}{n!}$
to
get
$\frac{p_{n+1}/(n+1)!}{p_n/n!} 
\to p
$.
From this,
setting
$p_n/n! = q_n$,
this would become
$\frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n}
\to p
$,
and things look hopeful. But,
since
$\frac{n}{n+1}
\to 1$,
$p
=\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\frac{p_{n+1}}{np_n}
=\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\frac{n}{n+1} \frac{p_{n+1}}{np_n}
=\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\frac{p_{n+1}}{(n+1)p_n} 
$. Proceeding as described,
letting
$p_n/n!
=q_n
$,
$p
=\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{q_{n+1}}{q_n}
$,
so
$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{q_n}{p^n}
= a
$
for some $a > 0$.
Therefore
$p_n
\approx n!p^n a
$. Since
$(n!)^{1/n}
\to \frac{n}{e}
$
and
$a^{1/n}
\to 1
$,
$\sqrt[n]{p_{n}} 
\approx \sqrt[n]{n!p^n a}
\to \frac{n}{e}p 
$
so
$\sqrt[n+1]{p_{n+1}}-\sqrt[n]{p_{n}} 
\to  \frac{n+1}{e}p- \frac{n}{e}p
= \frac{p}{e}
$
and we are done. My questions are: (1) Is my prove valid? (2) Is there are better proof? (3) Is there a more refined result, with more terms beyond
$\frac{p}{e}$?","['limits', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

1457380,"Motivation for definition of quotient map and ""passing to the quotient""","I'm a bit confused by the definition of of a quotient map between topological spaces. What is the reason for constructing a topology in this way? I am familiar with quotients from algebra and even so with the idea of taking the quotient by an equivalence relation, but defining quotient maps in this way seems strange/artificial to me. Especially since I'm used to seeing quotients on the domain, but quotient maps induce the quotient topology on their image. Also, could someone explain to me ""what is going on"" when we pass to the quotient? I understand the existence and uniqueness properties from a purely logical point of view but have no intuition on what passing to the quotient is actually achieving. It seems to me like we are constructing a unique continuous function given a quotient space and another continuous function (that satisfies some properties). Is that all? Again, what is the motivation? How are these constructions helpful?","['quotient-spaces', 'general-topology']"

Let $\Omega$ be the sample space consisting of all possible $\{a_i\}$ . The $\sigma$ -algebra is constructed in the following way. Let $\cal F_n, n\in\Bbb N$ be the set of sequences that can be determined by $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ union $\{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ . For example, let $A_0$ denote the set of sequences with $a_1=0$ , $A_1$ denote the set of sequences with $a_1=1$ , $A_{00}$ denote the set of sequences with $a_1=0,a_2=0$ , $A_{10}$ denote the set of sequences with $a_1=1, a_2=0$ , etc. Then $\cal F_1 = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A_0, A_1\}$ , $\cal F_2 = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A_0, A_1,A_{00},A_{01},A_{10},A_{11}\}$ , and so on. It is not hard to verify that $\cal F_n$ is increasing, i.e. $\cal F_n \subseteq \cal F_{n+1}$ . Define $\cal F_\infty = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \cal F_i$ , and we state a result that $\cal F_\infty$ is not a $\sigma$ -algebra. However,  the smallest $\sigma$ -algebra generated by $\cal F_\infty$ , denoted as $\sigma(\cal F_\infty)$ is what we need, and we can define a sensible probability measure on the measurable space $（\Omega, \sigma(\cal F_\infty))$ .

Let $\alpha: I\to R^3$ be a regular parametrized curve (not necessarily by arc length) and let $\beta:J\to R^3$ be a reparametrization of $\alpha(I)$ by the arc length $s=s(t)$, measured from $t_0\in I$. Let $t=t(s)$ be the inverse function of $s$ and set $d\alpha/dt=\alpha'$, $d^2\alpha/dt^2=\alpha''$, etc. Prove that the curvature of $\alpha$ at $t\in I$ is $$k(t)=\frac{|\alpha'\wedge\alpha''|}{{|\alpha'|}^3}$$ My attempt: We first simplify the RHS: $\frac{|\alpha'\wedge\alpha''|}{{|\alpha'|}^3}=\frac{|\alpha'||\alpha''|}{{|\alpha'|}^3}=\frac{|\alpha''|}{{|\alpha'|}^2}$, where I used the definition $|a\wedge b|=|a||b|\cos\theta$. Then we find the unit tangent vector of $\alpha$: $T(t)=\frac{\alpha'}{|\alpha'|}$. So $\frac{dT}{ds}=\frac{dT}{dt}\frac{dt}{ds}=T'(t)\frac{1}{|\alpha'|}$. Now it is very tempting to write $T'(t)=\frac{\alpha''}{|\alpha'|}$, then we have $\frac{dT}{ds}=\frac{\alpha''}{{|\alpha'|}^2}$ and since $\frac{dT}{ds}=kn$ where $n$ is the unit normal vector, so $k=\frac{|\alpha''|}{{|\alpha'|}^2}$. I really doubt my correctness, the part that I found it hard is to find $T'(t)$. And I think my working $T'(t)=\frac{\alpha''}{|\alpha'|}$ is wrong since the denominator might also be a function of $t$. But I am not sure how to fix it. Helps are really greatly appreciated!

1457743,Can we define higher-order tangent spaces of a manifold with equivalence classes defined equating second derivatives?,"I've been thinking of an obvious way to define higher order tangent space with smooth curves, but it seems that this definition does not coincide with the repeated tangent bundle construction. So, let $M$ be a smooth manifold, and let $\gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow M$ be a smooth curve with $\gamma(0) = p$. We can always define an equivalence relation on such paths as $\gamma_1 \equiv \gamma_2$ iff for all smooth functions $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, there exists an open neighborhood of $p$ on which $(f \circ \gamma_1)'(0) = (f \circ \gamma_2)'(0)$ and $(f \circ \gamma_1)''(0) = (f \circ \gamma_2)''(0)$. This would define a second order tangent space at $p$ for $M$ this way, and I guess that intuitively it would be a vector space of dimension $2 dim M$. Now, this means that the above construction would produce a second order tangent bundle of dimension $3 dim M$ (if it exists), while repeating the usual (first order) tangent bundle construction on $TM$ would produce a tangent bundle of dimension $4 dim M$.
Am I right here or did I miss something? Why is there such difference? (I think i understand the difference geometrically and why the dimensions disagree.

1458066,Isn't zero the only possible real solution for this simple ODE?,"The equation is simple as hell:
$$(D^2+i)x(t)=0$$
Clearly, eigenvalues are $\lambda_{1,2}=\pm(-\sqrt{2}/2+i\sqrt2 /2)$, so the complex solutions should be
$$x(t)=(A+Bi)e^{\left(-\sqrt{2}/2+i\sqrt{2}/2\right)t}+(C+Di)e^{\left(\sqrt{2}/2-i\sqrt{2}/2\right)t},\quad A,B,C,D\in\Bbb R$$
To find the real solutions, I break down the expression into the real and imaginary parts as
$$x(t)=e^{-t\sqrt2/2}(A\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t-B\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t)+e^{t\sqrt2/2}(C\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t+D\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t)+i\left[ e^{-t\sqrt2/2}(B\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t+A\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t)+e^{t\sqrt2/2}(D\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t-C\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t) \right]$$
So I let the imaginary parts be $0$, which means
$$(e^{-t\sqrt2/2}B+e^{t\sqrt2/2}D)\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t+(e^{-t\sqrt2/2}A-e^{t\sqrt2/2}C)\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t=0,\quad\forall t\in\Bbb R$$
I think it is equivalent to
$$B=-De^{t\sqrt2}\quad\text{and}\quad A=Ce^{t\sqrt2}$$
since $(e^{-t\sqrt2/2}B+e^{t\sqrt2/2}D)$ and $e^{-t\sqrt2/2}A-e^{t\sqrt2/2}C$ are both continuous functions. But when I plug the relationships between $A,B,C,D$ back into the complex solutions, I get
$$x(t)=2e^{t\sqrt2/2}(C\cos\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t+D\sin\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}t)$$
which is not zero! I have examined and reexamined my calculations and the result remains just the same. I do not know where I am wrong but I know I must be wrong, because if $x(t)$ is a non-zero real-valued function, $D^2x(t)=-ix(t)$ would never make sense. Can you guys help me out of this problem?

Show that $\sum\limits_p a_p$ converges if and only if $\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{\log n}$ converges. The way I was trying to go about the proof is using the integral convergence test and the Prime Number Theorem, by saying that $$\int_1^\infty a(p(x))dx = \int_2^\infty a(t)\pi'(t)dt$$ where $p(x)$ is an interpolated version of the n-th prime sequence, and $\pi(t)$ is the prime counting function. Then by the PNT, we know that $\pi(t) = \frac{t}{\log t} + O\left(\frac{t}{\log^2 t}\right)$ . By a leap of logic, I'd hope that $\pi'(t) = \frac{1}{\log t} + o\left(\frac{1}{\log t}\right)$ , which would make the last integral equal to $$\int_{2}^{\infty}\frac{a(t)}{\log t} dt + \text{terms of lower order}$$ This would then converge if and only if $\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{\log n}$ converges.

1458505,Mean curvature in terms of Christoffel symbols,"The Setup is the following: Let ($N$,g) be a Riemannian $n$-manifold and $M \subset N$ an embedded codimension 1 submanifold, everything oriented. My goal is to express the mean curvature of a point $p \in M$ in an appropriate coordinate chart in terms of only the (inverse) metric tensor and the Levi-Civita Connection of $N$. I am still not very confident in Riemannian geometry and one might like to check if the arguments are all valid. Furthermore, the result might help others: By the tubular neighborhood theorem, there exists a chart $x: p \in V \to \mathbb R^n$ around $p$ with $V$ open in $N$, such that, among other things: a) $x(p)=0$ and $U := x^{-1}(\mathbb R^{n-1} \times \{0\})$ is a neighborhood of $p$ in $M$. b) For $q \in U$ and $i=1,...,n-1$, the tangent vectors $\partial / \partial x_i|_q$ form a basis of $T_qM$ c) For $q \in U$, the tangent vector $\partial / \partial x_n|_q$ has unit length and is in $N_qM = (T_qM)^{\perp} \subset T_qN$. (I am not quite sure about the unit length part) Under these assumtions, if $\tilde{g}$ denotes the metric on $M$ induced by $g$, then $\forall q \in U: \tilde{g}_{ij}(q) = g_{ij}(q)$ for the respective metric tensors in the chart $x$ and $i,j \leq n-1$. We denote by $\vec{n}(q) = \partial / \partial x_n|_q$ the unit normal vector field on $U$. By definition, the mean curvature of $M$ at $q$ with respect to $\vec{n}(q)$ is equal to \begin{equation} \frac{1}{n-1} tr(\tilde{g}^{-1} II_q) \end{equation} in a chart, where $II_q$ denotes the second fundamental form of $M$ at $q$ that is defined as a quadratic form on $T_qM$ by $II_q(u,v) = \langle \nabla_u v, \vec{n}_q \rangle_{g(q)} $ with $\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection on $(N,g)$. Now in our chart $x$, we first note that if $\tilde{g}^{ij}(q)$ denotes the inverse metric tensor, we have by the above observation $\tilde{g}^{ij}(q) = {g}^{ij}(q)$. Moreover, for $i,j \leq n-1$, we have \begin{equation} II_q(i,j) := II_q(\partial/ \partial x_i, \partial / \partial x_j) = \langle \sum_{k=1}^n \Gamma_{ij}^k(q) \partial/ \partial x_k, \vec{n}(q) \rangle = \Gamma_{ij}^n(q), \end{equation}
so that \begin{equation} tr(\tilde{g}^{-1}II_q) = tr (\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \tilde{g}^{ik}(q)II_q(k,j) = \sum_{i,k=1}^{n-1} \tilde{g}^{ik}(q)II_q(k,i) = \sum_{i,k} g^{ik}(q)\Gamma_{ki}^n(q). \end{equation} Is this true?","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"

So can someone help me to fix this idea (If I am in the right track of course) or provide a different proof of this please? Edition I want to conclude that I can $$X\setminus A= \bigcup_n^{\infty}E_n$$ where the sets $E_n \subset X$ are nowhere dense.
To do that we use the fact that since $A$ is $G_{\delta}$ $$A=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}C_{n} $$ and given that $A$ is dense we have that eah $C_n$ is dense too. So now we may write (By DeMorgan's laws) $$X\setminus A= \bigcup_n^{\infty} X \setminus C_n$$ So we only need to prove that $X \setminus (X \setminus C_n)$ is dense, but $X \setminus (X \setminus C_n)=C_n$ that is dense, therefore $X \setminus A$ is of first category.

1458935,How to rigorously understand continuous bases?,"In Quantum Mechanics it is quite common to see the idea of a continuous basis of a Hilbert space. In truth if $\mathcal{H}$ is the state space of a quantum system and if $X : U\subset \mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{H}$ is the position operator then it is quite usual to consider the set of eigenvectors $\{|x\rangle : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ indexed by the eigenvalues $x\in \mathbb{R}$. In that case, Quantum Mechanics books usually assume that one can write for any $|\psi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}$ $$|\psi\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x\rangle\langle x|\psi\rangle  dx.$$ And also assume we have the completeness relation $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x\rangle \langle x| \ dx = I,$$ being $I$ the identity operator and considering $|x\rangle\langle x|$ to be the operator defined by $$(|x\rangle \langle x|)|\psi\rangle = |x\rangle \langle x|\psi\rangle.$$ Although this works and gives the correct results, I can't understand what is going on here. One of the points is that the integral involved here is quite strange. We are integrating $f(x) = |x\rangle \langle x|\psi\rangle$ but $f : \mathbb{R}\to \mathcal{H}$ and I'm not sure how this integral is defined.

I do not understand a small but crucial part of the surjectivity statement, and my question concerns this. Suppose $Y=\text{Spec} A$ and $X$ is covered by affine subschemes: $\{U_i=\text{Spec} B_i\}_i$. If we are given a ring morphism $\phi :A=\mathcal{O}_Y(Y)\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(X)$, $\phi$ can be composed with restriction maps to give $\phi_i : A \rightarrow \mathcal {O}_X(U_i) = B_i$. Then $\phi_i^{-1}$ induces affine scheme morphism $f_i:\text{Spec} B_i \rightarrow \text{Spec} A$. Now supposedly these affine scheme morphisms should agree on intersections. If they agree, the morphisms can be glued to obtain a morphism from $X$ to $Y$, and this gives the surjectivity. But I do not understand why any two morphisms should ever agree on the intersection. Qing Liu says that they should somehow obviously agree on affine subsets of the intersection, and I do not understand why that should happen either. Could anyone please be kind enough to explain this supposed triviality to me? If anyone still has the patience to read, let me explain what I am worried about in the supposed compatibility. You see, scheme structure of $X$ imposes no restriction whatsoever to the isomorphisms $U_i \cong \text{Spec} A_i$. If we composed some nontrivial scheme automorphism of $\text{Spec} A_i$ with this isomorphism (say, the automorphism on $\text{Spec} R[x,y]$ induced by exchange of $x$ and $y$) and replace the original morphism, then even if morphisms $\{\text{Spec} A_i\rightarrow \text{Spec} R\}$ previously agreed, the effect of the automorphism might cause the morphisms to agree no longer.

  $\bar{A}-$Int $A$ is path-connected, then the space $\bar{A}$ is path-connected. My Try:: Let $a,b\in \bar{A}$. It suffices to consider only the cases where, 1) $a,b\in $ Int $A$ and 2) $a\in $Int $A,b\in \bar{A}-$Int $A$ Regarding case 1), since $X$ is path connected there is a path $\alpha:[0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $\alpha(0)=a$ and $\alpha(1)=b$. After that I could give a pictorial proof as given in the picture below, but it was very difficult me to convert it to words. Can anybody please help me to write a complete proof in words?","['connectedness', 'general-topology']"
1459652,Group with two generators of order 3 is finite,"A group $G$ is generated by two elements $a$ and $b$ such that for any $g\in G:$ $g^3=e$. Show that $G$ is finite. I don't understand how this is so. I don't know if $G$ is abelian, so I can construct more and more elements of the group of the form $abababababababab...$ which can't be simplified. So how do I know $G$ is finite? (If it was abelian, I could simply list all the elements $e,a,a^2,b,b^2,ab,a^2b,ab^2,a^2b^2$.)","['abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups']"
1459681,Find the derivative of the function $f(x)=x/(x^2+1)$ at a point a,"$$\frac{x}{x^2+1}$$
I have to find the derivative and set a point by myself. So I just set $x=a$ ( is it correct?) and using the limit, $$ \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}  = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{a+h}{(a+h)^2 + 1} - \frac{a}{a^2+1}}{h}$$ therefore, the answer is $$\frac{ 1-a^2}{(a^2+1)^2}$$ is it correct?","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1459704,Evaluate a game skill benefit,"I ask a same problem yesterday, but my post has so many grammar error.
I am very sorry about that! Sorry for my poor English.
So now I try to use more simple sentences for me to describe this problem again: A player can fire magic ball, which has 4 second CD time Magic ball will hit to an enemy, the hit rate depend on player skill A magic ball has 15% chance to make a buff to the enemy, this buff will cause the enemy loses his 0.1% MAX-HP per second An enemy can be made only one buff, and buff exist time, 10 second~40 second,  is depend on enemy's defend value An enemy has a special skill, called ""RB"", can remove this buff immediately, this special skill has 60 second CD time My question is that Now I have a skill, called ""MA"", which can increase 5% chance of buff making, it means that 15% => 20%.
How about the expected damage of skill ""MA""? ================================================================== I have some preliminary idea and I will try to describe them in follow: I think this problem can make a math form - (Expected Damage) = (Magic ball hit number) (Magic ball hit rate) (Buff chance) (0.1% Enemy Max HP) (Buff exist time) Where (Magic ball hit number) is a random variable depend on fire CD time, maybe a Poisson distribution (Magic ball hit rate) is a random variable depend on player skill, maybe a logarithmic distribution, according to ELO evaluation. (0.1% Enemy Max HP) is a random variable depend on average enemy's MAX HP (Buff exist time) is a random variable depend on average enemy's defend value, a continuous random variable I think this is Multiple-Random-Variable-Expected-Value problem, but I do not have any idea to evaluate it. Please give me some tips or research direction.
