3283086,Covering of genus 2 of elliptic curve,"I am reading this paper and I get confused somewhere: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4612-0457-2_7 So the set up is the following: Let $C$ be a genus 2 curve. Suppose $C$ admits a degree $n$ covering of elliptic curve $E_{1}$ over a field $K$ : $$\phi_{1}: C \to E_{1}$$ where $n$ prime to char $K$ . Assume there is no non tirivial unramified covering between $E_{1}$ and $C$ . Let $J$ be the jacobian of $C$ . Then there are induced maps by $\phi_{1}$ : $$\phi_{1}^{*}:E_{1} \to J$$ $$\phi_{1,*}:J \to E_{1}$$ (The authors didn't say how these maps work explicitly, my understanding of these two maps are: $\phi_{1}^{*}$ is the pullback from $E_{1}$ to $C^{n}$ and then map to $J$ ; $\phi_{1,*}$ maps $J$ to $C^{n}$ then each factor of $C^{n}$ maps to $E_{1}$ and add up in $E_{1}$ .) The author said that the maximality of $C \to E_{1}$ implies that $\phi_{1}$ is injective and that $ker(\phi_{1,*})$ is an elliptic curve $E_{2}^{*}$ (cf. Serre). Why this $\phi_{1}$ is injective? Isn't it a degree $n$ covering so one should expect $n$ preimages generically? The projection map $\phi_{2,*}: J \to J/E_{1}^{*}=:E_{2}$ induces a covering $$\phi_{2}:C \to E_{2}$$ of degree $n$ . And the map $$h:\phi_{1}^{*} \times \phi_{2}^{*}:E_{1} \times E_{2} \to J$$ is an isogeny of degree $n^{2}$ . Why it is of degree $n^{2}$ ? I've tried the sum of pullbacks but it looks not easy to find (explitcitly) the $n^{2}$ kernel. Anyone knows how this map works on elements?

3283121,Continuity of mean and quantile functionals,"We say the functional $\gamma$ is continuous if for all $\varepsilon>0$ and two cdfs $F$ and $G$ , there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $\|G-F\|_\infty=\sup_{t\in\mathbb{R}}|G(t)-F(t)|\leq\delta$ implies $|\gamma(G)-\gamma(F)|\leq\varepsilon$ . Now try to prove or disprove the continuity of mean and quatile functional, which are mean: $F\to\int xdF(x)$ ; quantile: $Q_{\alpha}(F)=\inf \{t\in\mathbb{R}|F(t)\geq \alpha\}$ . Intuitively, I think mean functional is continuous however I don't know how to bound the integral as it contains the derivative and then control it via the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ between $F$ and $G$ . While quantile seems to be more complicated and I wonder if there exist some tricks to transfer the definition to a more direct form with respect the the sup-norm.

3283299,Contraction of indices of connection coefficients: Levi-Civita connection vs other connections,"I am wondering in what sense the formula of contraction of indices for the connection coefficients of the Levi-Civita connection (i.e. the Christoffel symbols) is valid for other connections. \begin{equation} \tag{1}

I have simulated a time series from this mixture distribution and performed Bayesian model averaging on it, where I also included Gaussian and logistic models. In theory, I should end up with the posterior of the distribution with smallest divergence converging to 1, but it seems that the posteriors do not actually converge, even after a sample of $7500$ observations. Hence, this made me want to attack this problem analytically. Could it perhaps be that the divergences are equal or at least very close? I am struggling to calculate the divergences myself, since I either end up with a very nasty integral or a very nasty expectation.

3283413,"Let $I=(y^2-x^2,y^2+x^2)$. Find $V(I)$ and $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I)$","To find $V(I)$ we note that the only point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying both $y^2-x^2=0$ and $y^2+x^2=0$ is $(0,0)$ , so $V(I)=(0,0)$ . Now, to find $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I)$ , we have the following relations: $$y^2-x^2\equiv 0 \mod I$$ $$y^2+x^2\equiv 0 \mod I$$ From where it follows that $y^2 \equiv 0 \mod I$ , and consequently $x^2\equiv 0 \mod I$ . From this, I understand that every monomial with degree 3 or more, like $xy^2$ for example, is $0$ . The polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I$ then are just a linear combination of $\lbrace 1,x,y,xy \rbrace $ , and so $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I)=4$ . Is this correct? I would like to know a more general way of doing this, given that this felt like a very rudimentary approach, and only possible given that the ideal was very simple. If I had any other ideal generated by a couple of polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ , how could I find $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I$ ?

3283452,Integral $\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}\left(\frac{3\arctan x}{x}+2\ln x\right)dx$,"I was playing around with PARI GP to generate a challenging integral. The method:
The function lindep is intended to detect integer dependence. The constants used: $\text{G}\ln 2,\pi^3,\pi\ln^2 2,\ln^3 2,\pi^2\ln 2,\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln^2(\cos x)\,dx$ . All these numbers are of ""degree"" $3$ . To get a challenging integral you multiply, $\ln(1+x),\ln(1+x^2),\dfrac{1}{1+x^2},\arctan x,\dfrac{1}{1+x},\dfrac{1}{x}$ The idea is to sum up two integrals to cancel out the awful term $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln^2(\cos x)\,dx$ After ten minutes, I have found: \begin{align}A&=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}\,dx\\
&=-3\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln^2(\cos x)\,dx+...\\
B&=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)\arctan x}{x(1+x^2)}\,dx\\
&=2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln^2(\cos x)\,dx+...\\
\end{align} Now, if you take $2A+3B$ you cancel out the term $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln^2(\cos x)\,dx$ .
The result is: \begin{align}\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}\left(\frac{3\arctan x}{x}+2\ln x\right)dx=\frac{5}{128}\pi^3-\frac{7}{4}\text{G}\ln 2+\frac{3}{16}\pi \ln^2 2\end{align} The question is: How to prove this? Addendum :
My first candidate for $B$ was: $\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)\arctan x}{1+x^2}\,dx$ but it's not expressible as an integer linear combination of the chosen constants. Probably not related to constants of ""degree"" $3$ .

It also has some practical applications in computational mathematics. The Fabius function ${\bf F}(x)$ is constant $0$ for all $x\le0,$ but some authors prefer to define it only on $[0,\infty)$ or only on $[0,1].$ Some authors study a very closely related Rvachev ${^{\texttip{\dagger}{also variously spelled as Rvachëv or Rvachyov, a.k.a.

After lots of experimentation and looking for patterns in its values I came up with a conjectured empirical formula. Let ${^{\texttip{\dagger}{the superscript 𝑚 is just an index here, not to be confused with a power}}}$ $$\mathscr F^m_n = \frac1{2^{n^2}\left(\frac12;{\tiny\text{ }}\frac12\right)_n}\,\sum _{k=0}^n\frac{\binom n k_{1/2}}{2^{{\tiny\text{ }}k{\tiny\text{ }}(k-1)}(n+k)!}\,\sum _{\ell=0}^{2^k{\tiny\text{ }}m-1}\,(-1)^{s_2\left(\ell\right)}\,\left(\ell-2^km+\tfrac12\right)^{n+k}{\small,}\tag{$\small\spadesuit$}$$ where $k,\,\ell,\,m,\,n$ are non-negative integers, $\displaystyle\small\left(a;{\tiny\text{ }}q\right)_n=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1-a{\tiny\text{ }}q^k)$ is the q -Pochhammer symbol ${^{\texttip{\dagger}{it assumes only rational values in this formula}}}$ , ${\binom n k}_q=\displaystyle\small\frac{\left(q;{\tiny\text{ }}q\right)_n}{\left(q;{\tiny\text{ }}q\right)_k\left(q;{\tiny\text{ }}q\right)_{n-k}}\vphantom{\Huge|}$ is the q -binomial coefficient ${^{\texttip{\dagger}{it assumes only rational values in this formula}}}$ , and $s_2(n)\vphantom{\Huge|}$ is the sum of binary digits ${^{\texttip{\dagger}{i.e. the number of 1's in the base-2 representation}}}$ of $n$ (note that $(-1)^{s_2\left(n\right)} = t_n\vphantom{\Huge|}$ is just the signed version of the Thue–Morse sequence , satisfying recurrence $t_0 = 1,\,t_n = (-1)^n \, t_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor};\vphantom{\Huge|}$ see also ${^{[10]}}$ ${\!^{[11]}}$ ${\!^{[12]}}$ ). I conjecture that for all non-negative integers $m,\,n,$ the following identity holds: $${\bf F}\!\left({\small\frac m{2^n}}\right)=\mathscr F^m_n.\tag{$\small\diamondsuit$}$$ Note that there is no requirement for $\frac m{2^n}$ to be a proper irreducible fraction — it might well be that $m$ is even, or $m>2^n$ . I have not been able to rigorously prove it yet, but it produces exact rational values that agree with those computed using known correct algorithms for all dyadic rational arguments I have tried. Of course, this formula did not just appear out of the blue — its structure was inspired by known algorithms, and it went a long way to this relatively concise form (at some point it had about $5$ levels of nested summations/products). Can we prove that $\small(\diamondsuit)$ is indeed a correct representation of the Fabius function at dyadic rationals? If the conjecture is difficult to tackle at once, we can try to at least prove that the function defined by $\small(\spadesuit)$ shares some known properties with the Fabius function, e.g.: $0\le\mathscr F^m_n\le1,$ $\mathscr F^m_n = \mathscr F^{2{\tiny\text{ }}m}_{n+1}\vphantom{\Large|}$ — the result is the same across all representations of a rational number $\frac m{2^n}$ , $\mathscr F^m_n = 1-\mathscr F^{(2^n-m)}_n\vphantom{\Large|}$ for all $\small0\le m\le2^{n}$ — rotation symmetry, $\mathscr F^m_n = \mathscr F^{(2^{n+1}-m)}_n\vphantom{\Large|}$ for all $\small0\le m\le2^{n+1}$ — reflection symmetry, for a fixed $n,$ and $\small0\le m\le2^n$ the values of $\mathscr F^m_n\vphantom{\Large|}$ strictly increase, all points $\small\left(\frac m{2^n},\,\mathscr F^m_n\right)\vphantom{\Large|}$ lie on a continuous curve — for any convergent sequence of dyadic rationals $\frac m{2^n}\vphantom{\Large|}$ , the sequence of corresponding values $\mathscr F^m_n\vphantom{\Large|}$ also converges. If the conjecture $\small(\diamondsuit)$ it true, then for all $0\le x\le1$ (not necessary rational) $${\bf F}\!\left(x\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\,\frac1{2^{n^2}\left(\frac12;{\tiny\text{ }}\frac12\right)_n}\,\sum _{k=0}^n\frac{\binom n k_{1/2}}{2^{{\tiny\text{ }}k{\tiny\text{ }}(k-1)}(n+k)!}\,\sum _{\ell=0}^{\left\lfloor2^{n+k}{\tiny\text{ }}x-1\right\rfloor}\,(-1)^{s_2\left(\ell\right)}\,\left(\ell-2^{n+k}{\tiny\text{ }}x+\tfrac12\right)^{n+k}.\tag{$\small\heartsuit$}$$ For dyadic rational $x$ the limit is trivial, because the sequence under the limit becomes constant for large enough $n$ . Also, there is a known series (by Rvachev) that expresses values of the Fabius function for all $0\le x\le1$ via its values at negative powers of $2$ : $${\bf F}\!\left(x\right)=\sum _{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{\left\lfloor 2^n{\tiny\text{ }}x\right\rfloor }-1}{2}\,(-1)^{s_2\left(\lfloor2^n{\tiny\text{ }}x\rfloor\right)}\;\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{2^{\frac{k{\tiny\text{ }}(k+1)}2}}{k!}\,\left(x-2^{-n}\left\lfloor 2^n{\tiny\text{ }}x\right\rfloor\right)^k\;{\bf F}\!\left(2^{{\tiny\text{ }}k-n}\right).\tag{$\small\clubsuit$}$$ Again, for dyadic rational $x$ this series terminates after a finite number of terms, producing an exact rational value.","['conjectures', 'q-analogs', 'real-analysis', 'experimental-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series']"

3283559,Prove that the diophantine equation $2x^2-5y^2=7$ has no integer solutions.,"My attempt: I rewrote it as $2x^2=5y^2+7. 2x^2$ is always even, so in order for the RHS to be even, this means that $5y^2$ must be odd since an odd number plus $7$ is even. If I evaluate when y is odd, so if $y=2k+1$ for some integer $k$ , I get: $2x^2=20k^2+20k+12$ . This is the same as $x^2=10k^2+10k+6$ , which implies that $x^2$ is congruent $6$ (mod $10$ ). Here, I arrive at an issue because if $x=4$ , then I get that $x^2$ is congruent to $6$ (mod $10$ ), but I am supposed to show that the equation does not have a $6$ (mod $10$ ) congruency.","['number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'diophantine-equations']"

Denote the open left half plane by $\mathbb{H}_{L}$ . Since this question deals with something on the $\mathbb{H}_{L}$ , the first idea for me was to use conformal mapping so that we can sort of connect the open $\mathbb{H}_{L}$ to $\mathbb{D}$ . However, the thing here is that we have no idea where $f(z)$ maps $\mathbb{H}_{L}$ to, so the I compose in the following way. Cleary the maps $$g:\mathbb{H}\longrightarrow\mathbb{H}_{L},\ \text{by}\ z\mapsto iz$$ and $$F:\mathbb{D}\longrightarrow\mathbb{H},\ \text{by}\ z\mapsto i\dfrac{1-z}{1+z}$$ are conformal. Then, I compose $f\circ g\circ F:\mathbb{D}\longrightarrow \text{unknown}$ . I hoped that the composition map would finally look like an automorphism of $\mathbb{D}$ . However, it seems impossible to get rid of the $z^{2}$ . On the other hand, I tried to compose as $$F^{-1}\circ g^{-1}:\mathbb{H}_{L}\longrightarrow\mathbb{D}, $$ which gives us a map $$z\mapsto\dfrac{1+z}{1-z}.$$ This one is closer to $f(z)$ except for there is no $az^{2}$ on either the numerator or the denominator.

The function can use any mathematical operators that a computer can calculate. How would we even go about finding the shortest possible equation (or one of the shortest) without a slow brute-force? Any smart tricks we can use? Let's say we have n = 6415607 , then how can we quickly find that the shortest equation for it is (23 ^ 5) - (12 ^ 4) and not something short like 186 ^ 3 ? (it's not, it's just an example) It's fine if some of the integers cannot be compressed into an equation. There's 2 preferred conditions: The equation should be as short and as easy to compute as possible. For example, for n = 17 it should generate something like n = 2 ^ 4 + 1 Computation speed should not grow exponentially with integer length, the function should generate the equation relatively quickly, regardless of the integer's length.

I was considering some simple applications of Sylow theorems. I have made some questions. Among them, there was one which asks to prove that a group of order 200 always have a subgroup of order 100. This question has a simple solution since the Sylow group of order $25$ is unique and hence normal. After this, I became curious about the existence of normal subgroups of order $2^k p^l$ of groups of order $2^{k+1} p^l$ . The following two paragraphs are about my failed attempt which may not helpful. For a group of order $400$ , say $G$ , let $n_5$ be the number of Sylow group of order $25$ . If $n_5 =1$ , we are done. So suppose that $n_5 = 16$ . Let $A$ and $B$ be two Sylow subgroups of order $25$ . Analysing the number of elements in the set $AB$ , one can conclude that the order of $A \cap B$ to be $5$ . This forced $A \cap B$ to be normal subgroup in $A$ and $B$ . I was considered the normalizer $N(A \cap B)$ . For this should contain $A$ and $B$ , the order of $N(A \cap B)$ should be $200$ or $400$ . If it was $200$ , we are done. So suppose that for every pair of different Sylow groups of order $25$ $A$ and $B$ , $A \cap B$ is normal. If there occur two different intersections of order $5$ , we are done since the product of two such normal subgroups of order $5$ will provide a normal subgroup of order $25$ . The point I was stuck is there. Specifically, if a counterexample exists, it should have $16$ Sylow subgroups or order $25$ whose intersection is of order $5$ . The followings are just some consideration for generalization which may ""not even wrong"" Most generally, I'm curious about the condition of $n$ which forces to exist a subgroup of order $n$ of a group of order $2n$ .
Note that as all of you know, there are some groups of even order without having subgroups of index $2$ .
All simple groups of even order have this property since a subgroup of index $2$ is automatically normal.
Anyway, let me just state the general question. Find a simple criterion for a positive integer $n$ to have the property that every group of order $2n$ has a subgroup of index $2$ .

3283990,Derivative of a Rotation Matrix with changing rotation axis,"Just to introduce the background of this question: As many of you know a Rotation Matrix can transform a point $^{B}\textrm{p}$ described in a rotated Coordinate Frame {B} into the point $^{A}\textrm{p}$ described in the Coordinate Frame {A} by: $^{A}\textrm{p}$ = $^{A}\textrm{R}_B \ ^{B}\textrm{p}$ The Rotation Matrix's $^{A}\textrm{R}_B$ columns are the unit vectors of {B}'s axis described in Frame {A}. Also the Rotation about a given axis can be given by: $^{A}\textrm{R}_B$ = $e^{[\hat{w}]_x\theta}$ , whereas $[\hat{w}]_x$ is the skew-symmetric 3x3 matrix of the unit vector of $\hat{w}$ (deschribed in Frame A), around which the Frame is being rotated. $\theta$ is the rotation angle (and a scalar). Now my question:
Almost every book and paper i found states that the time-derivative of the Rotation Matrix is the following: $\frac{d}{dt}(^{A}\textrm{R}_B)$ = $[w]_x \  ^{A}\textrm{R}_B \qquad (1)$ Does the solution require that the direction of $\hat{w}$ remains constant at all times? Because if we use the chain rule on with a (1): $\frac{d}{dt}e^{[\hat{w}]_x\theta}$ = $\frac{d}{dt}([\hat{w}(t)]_x\theta(t)) \cdot e^{[\hat{w}]_x\theta}$ = $\frac{d}{dt}([\hat{w}(t)]_x)\theta(t) e^{[\hat{w}(t)]_x\theta(t)} + [\hat{w}(t)]_x)\dot{\theta}(t) e^{[\hat{w}(t)]_x\theta(t)}$ which can be further simplified to: $\frac{d}{dt}e^{[\hat{w}]_x\theta}$ = $(\frac{d}{dt}([\hat{w}(t)]_x)\theta(t)  + [w(t)]_x)^{A}\textrm{R}_B$ Whereas $[w(t)]_x=[\hat{w}(t)]_x\theta(t)$ Thus this is not equal to (1) and an addition term is generated.

3284535,Trouble with the definition of the cross product,"Throughout the question, please keep in mind that I know very little differential geometry. I.e., just the intrinsic definitions of differentiable/Riemannian manifolds and the metric tensor, etc. I am trying to understand the definition of the cross product given by Wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Index_notation_for_tensors The article says that we can define the cross product $c$ of two vectors $u$ , $v$ given a suitable ""dot product"" $\eta^{mi}$ as follows $c^m := \sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3\eta^{mi}\epsilon_{ijk}u^jv^k$ To demonstrate my current understanding of this definition, I will introduce some notation and terminology. Then I will show where my confusion arises with an example. I do apologize in advance for the length of this post. Let $M$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the metric tensor $g$ . Pick a coordinate chart $(U,\phi)$ with $\phi$ a diffeomorphism. We define a collection $\beta = \{b_i:U \to TM | i\in\{1,2,3\}\}$ of vector fields, called coordinate vectors, as follows $b_i(x) := \Big(x,\big(\delta_x \circ \frac{\partial{\phi^{-1}}}{\partial{q_i}} \circ \phi\big)(x)\Big)$ where $\delta_x:\mathbb{R}^3 \to T_xM$ denotes the canonical bijection. The coordinate vectors induce a natural basis $\gamma_x$ at each point $x \in U$ for the tangent space $T_xM$ . Let $[g_x]_S$ denote the matrix representation of the metric tensor at the point $x$ in the standard basis for $T_xM$ and let $[g_x]_{\gamma_x}$ denote the matrix representation in the basis $\gamma_x$ . My understanding of the above definition of the cross product now follows. Let $u,v \in T_xM$ be tangent vectors and let $[u]_{\gamma_x}=\begin{bmatrix}
u_1\\
u_2\\
u_3
\end{bmatrix}$ $\space \space \space \space \space \space [v]_{\gamma_x}=\begin{bmatrix}
v_1\\
v_2\\
v_3
\end{bmatrix}$ denote the coordinates of $u,v$ in the basis $\gamma_x$ . Then we define the $m$ th coordinate of the cross product $u \times v \in T_xM$ in the basis $\gamma_x$ as $\big([u \times v]_{\gamma_x}\big)_m := \sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3\big([g_x]_{\gamma_x}\big)_{mi}\epsilon_{ijk}u_jv_k$ Now I will demonstrate my apparent misunderstanding with an example. Let the manifold $M$ be the usual Riemannian manifold on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\phi$ be given by $\phi(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_1,x_2,x_3-x_1^2-x_2^2)$ $\phi^{-1}(q_1,q_2,q_3)=(q_1,q_2,q_3+q_1^2+q_2^2)$ The Jacobian matrix $J$ of $\phi^{-1}$ is $J=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
2q_1 & 2q_2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ $\space \space \space \space \space \space J^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
-2q_1 & -2q_2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ And the matrix representation of the metric tensor in the basis $\gamma_x$ is $[g_x]_{\gamma_x} = J^T[g_x]_SJ = \begin{bmatrix}
1+4q_1^2 & 4q_1q_2 & 2q_1 \\\
4q_1q_2 & 1+4q_2^2 & 2q_2 \\\
2q_1 & 2q_2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ Now choose $x=(1,1,-1)$ . The coordinates of $x$ are evidently $\phi(x) = (1,1,1)$ and the three matrices above become $J=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
2 & 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ $\space \space \space \space \space \space J^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
-2 & -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ $\space \space \space \space \space \space [g_x]_{\gamma_x} = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 4 & 2 \\\
4 & 5 & 2 \\\
2 & 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ Now we compute the cross product in the basis $\gamma_x$ . Using my understanding of the definition as outlined above, I get $[u \times v]_{\gamma_x} = \begin{bmatrix}
36 \\\
35 \\\
16
\end{bmatrix}$ If we instead compute the cross product in the standard basis, then using my understanding of the definition, I get $[u \times v]_S = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\\
-1 \\\
2
\end{bmatrix}$ Naturally, these results ought to agree if we perform a change of basis on $[u \times v]_{\gamma_x}$ . Doing just that, I get $[u \times v]_S = J[u \times v]_{\gamma_x} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
2 & 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
36 \\\
35 \\\
16
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
36 \\\
35 \\\
158
\end{bmatrix}$ Clearly, these do not agree. I can think of several reasons for this. Perhaps the definition given on Wikipedia is erroneous or only works for orthogonal coordinates. Perhaps I am misinterpreting the definition given on Wikipedia. Or maybe I have made an error somewhere in my calculation. My question is then as follows. How should I interpret the definition given on Wikipedia, and how should one express that definition using the notation provided here?","['coordinate-systems', 'cross-product', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3284703,"$I_n(t,a) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(xt)}{\left(x^2 + a^2\right)^n}\:dx$","Spurred on by this , here I'm hoping to resolve the following integral: \begin{equation}
I_n(a,t) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(xt)}{\left(x^2 + a^2\right)^n}\:dx
\end{equation} Where $a,t \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . To begin with we observe that: \begin{equation}
I_n(a,t) =  \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(xt)}{\left(a^2\left(\frac{x^2}{a^2} + 1\right)\right)^n}\:dx = \frac{1}{a^{2n}}  \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(xt)}{\left(\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + 1\right)^n}\:dx
\end{equation} Let $u = \frac{x}{a}$ : \begin{align}
I_n(a,t) &= \frac{1}{a^{2n}} \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(uat)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\cdot a\:du = a^{1 - 2n}\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(uat)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du  \\
&=a^{1 - 2n}I_n(1, at)
\end{align} Thus, we need only resolve the following integral to solve $I_n(a,t)$ : \begin{equation}
J_n(s) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(su)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du
\end{equation} Noting $I_n(a,t) = J_n(at)$ . Here we will proceed by forming a differential equation for $J_n(s)$ . To do so, we employ Leibniz's Integral Rule and differentiate under the curve twice w.r.t $s$ : \begin{align}
\frac{d^2J_n}{ds^2} &= \int_0^\infty \frac{-u^2\cos(su)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du = -\int_0^\infty \frac{\left(u^2 + 1 - 1\right)\cos(su)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du \nonumber \\
&=-\left[\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(su)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^{n - 1}}\:du -  \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(su)}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du\right] \nonumber \\
&=-\left[J_{n - 1}(s) - J_n(s) \right] = J_n(s) - J_{n - 1}(s)
\end{align} Thus we form the recursive differential equation: \begin{equation}
\frac{d^2J_n}{ds^2}- J_n(s) = -J_{n - 1}(s)
\end{equation} In order for a solution to be obtained, the following is required: $I_1(s)$ , $I_n(0)$ , and $I_n'(0)$ . Thankfully these are all easy to obtain. Starting with $I_1(s)$ we find: \begin{equation}
I_n(s) = \frac{\pi}{2}e^{-s}
\end{equation} For $I_n(0)$ we have: \begin{equation}
I_n(0) = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\left(u^2 + 1\right)^n}\:du
\end{equation} Using the subsitution $u = \tan(w)$ we obtain a solution in terms of the Beta (and by extension Gamma) function: \begin{align}
I_n(0) &= \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{\left(\tan^2(w) + 1\right)^n}\cdot \sec^2(w)\:dw = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \cos^{2n - 2}(w)\:dw \nonumber \\
&= \frac{1}{2}B\left( \frac{2n - 1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{2n - 1}{2}\right)\Gamma\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{2n - 1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right)} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{2n - 1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(n)}
\end{align} For $I_n'(0)$ we have: \begin{equation}
I_n'(0) = \int_0^\infty \frac{-x\sin(x \cdot 0)}{\left(x^2 + 1\right)^n} = 0
\end{equation} Now, and here is where I'm unsure about my process - for our recursive differential equation we take the Laplace Transform: \begin{align}
\mathscr{L}_{s \rightarrow p}\left[ \frac{d^2J_n}{ds^2} \right] - \mathscr{L}_{s \rightarrow p}\left[J_n(s) \right] &= -\mathscr{L}_{s \rightarrow p}\left[ J_{n - 1}(s) \right] \nonumber \\
p^2 \overline{J}_n(p) - pJ_n(0) - J_n'(0) - \overline{J}_{n}(p) &= -\overline{J}_{n - 1}(p) \nonumber \\ 
\left(p^2 - 1\right)\overline{J}_n(p) &= pJ_n(0) -\overline{J}_{n - 1}(p)
\end{align} Thus, \begin{equation}
\overline{J}_n(p) = \frac{p}{p^2 - 1} J_n(0) - \frac{1}{p^2 - 1}\overline{J}_{n - 1}(p)
\end{equation} We now take the Inverse Laplace Transform: \begin{align}
\mathscr{L}_{p \rightarrow s}^{-1} \left[\overline{J}_n(p)\right] &= \mathscr{L}_{p \rightarrow s}^{-1} \left[\frac{p}{p^2 - 1}\right]J_n(0)  - \mathscr{L}_{p \rightarrow s}^{-1} \left[\frac{1}{p^2 - 1}\overline{J}_{n - 1}(p)\right] \nonumber \\
J_n(s) &= J_n(0)\cosh(s) - \int_0^s \sinh(s - a)J_{n - 1}(a)\:da \nonumber \\
 &= J_n(0)\cosh(s) - \int_0^s \left[\sinh(s)\cosh(a) - \sinh(a)\cosh(s)\right]J_{n - 1}(a)\:da \nonumber \\
&= J_n(0)\cosh(s) - \sinh(s)\int_0^s\cosh(a) J_{n - 1}(a)\:da \nonumber \\
&\quad+ \cosh(s)\int_0^2 \sinh(a)J_{n - 1}(a)\:da
\end{align} Now whilst we have a recursive integral form that governs $J_n(s)$ I am unsure how to solve it!. Does anyone have any pointers about how to move forward? Another approach (I believe) is to employ the linear D-operator. Here if we define $D = \frac{d}{ds}$ then our governing differential equation is given by: \begin{equation}
\left(D - 1\right)\left(D + 1\right)\left[ J_{n}(s)\right] = -J_{n - 1}(s)
\end{equation} Thus, \begin{equation}
J_n(s) = -\left(\left(D - 1\right)\left(D + 1\right)\right)^{-1}\left[ J_{n-1}(s)\right]
\end{equation} Which is my reasoning is correct implies that \begin{align}
J_n(s) &= (-1)^n \left(\left(D - 1\right)\left(D + 1\right)\right)^{-(n - 1)}\left[ J_1(s)\right] = (-1)^n \left(\left(D - 1\right)\left(D + 1\right)\right)^{-(n - 1)}\left[ \frac{\pi}{2}e^{-s}\right] \nonumber \\
&= (-1)^n \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\left(D - 1\right)\left(D + 1\right)\right)^{-(n - 1)}\left[ e^{-s}\right]

Now, using the definition of $\sigma(q^k)$ and $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ for $q$ prime, we derive $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{q - 1} = b^2$$ and $$\frac{q^k - 1}{q - 1} = a^2.$$ Assume to the contrary that $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{q - 1} = b^2 \leq a^2 = \frac{q^k - 1}{q - 1}.$$ This assumption leads to $$q^{k+1} - 1 \leq 2(q^k - 1)$$ which implies that $$16 = {5^1}(5-2) + 1 \leq q^k(q - 2) + 1 = q^{k+1} - 2q^k + 1 \leq 0,$$ since $q$ is a prime satisfying $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ .  This results in the contradiction $16 \leq 0$ .  Consequently, we conclude that $a < b$ . Furthermore, I know that $$(q+1) = \sigma(q) \mid \sigma(q^k) = 2b^2$$ so that $$\frac{q+1}{2} \leq b^2.$$ Finally, I also have $$\frac{q^{k+1} - 1}{2b^2} = q - 1 = \frac{q^k - 1}{a^2}.$$ Alas, here is where I get stuck. CONJECTURE (Open) If $q$ is a prime satisfying $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ , then $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ and $\sigma(q^k)/2$ are both squares when $k = 1$ . SUMMARY OF RESULTS SO FAR zongxiangyi appears to have proven the implication $$\sigma(q^k)/2 \text{ is a square} \implies k = 1.$$ The proof of the following implication is trivial $$k = 1 \implies \sigma(q^{k-1}) \text{ is a square}.$$ The truth value of the following implication is currently unknown: $$\sigma(q^{k-1}) \text{ is a square} \implies k = 1.$$ Together, the two results give $$\sigma(q^k)/2 \text{ is a square} \implies k = 1 \iff \sigma(q^{k-1}) \text{ is a square},$$ so that $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ is a square if $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is a square . Therefore, $\sigma(q^{k-1})$ and $\sigma(q^k)/2$ are both squares (given $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ ) when $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is a square .","['conjectures', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'square-numbers', 'divisor-sum']"

For these projections to add up nicely to $x$ , I'm thinking that: either $x\in K^+ \cap  L^+$ or if $ x\notin K^+ \cap  L^+$ , $x$ should make an acute angle with the closest boundaries/faces of the dual cones.

3284966,Determinants through dot products,"Thanks for reading! So, in Paulo Buchsbaum's answer to this question on Quora... https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-mathematical-intuition-behind-the-determinant-of-a-matrix-How-was-its-definition-conceived-and-why-is-it-important-What-does-it-mean-intuitively ...he defines a beautiful way to calculate the determinant of a matrix through dot products. One I hadn't seen before. He goes through the process of calculating this determinant for a $(3,3)$ matrix. I know this is a long request, but I was wondering if someone could take me through the process of doing it for a $(4,4)$ dimensional matrix, as (as you can see from my comment to his answer) I'm getting really confused. I would really appreciate it! Thank you! Edit: After reading @MatthewTowers comment (thanks), here is my explanation of what he's done for the $(3,3)$ case: Let's say we've got a $(3,3)$ matrix with a left column vector $\vec{a}$ , a middle column vector $\vec{b}$ , and a right column vector $\vec{c}$ . These three vectors create a parallelepiped. The volume of that parallelepiped is the determinant of the matrix. As you read, here's a picture (taken from Paulo's answer) for reference: Each vector has three components since they exist in three-dimensional space (aka the matrix has three rows) . $\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} \vec{c} = \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \end{bmatrix}$ Note that $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ create a parallelogram. This parallelogram is the ""base"" of the parallelepiped created by all three column-vectors, and the component of $\vec{a}$ perpendicular to this parallelogram is the height of the parallelepiped. Let's ignore $\vec{a}$ for now. The first step is to find a vector $\vec{n}$ that's orthogonal to both $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ . We set $\vec{n} \bullet \vec{b}=0$ and $\vec{n} \bullet \vec{c}=0$ . Or, in other words, $n_1b_1 + n_2b_2 + n_3b_3 = 0$ and $n_1c_1 + n_2c_2 + n_3c_3 = 0$ That's three unknowns and only two equations. However, we can choose $n_1$ to be whatever we want, which allows us to solve for $\vec{n}$ . The second step is to find a vector $\vec{o}$ that's orthogonal to $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{n}$ . Notice that $\vec{o}$ will be in the same plane as $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ , but will be perpendicular to $\vec{b}$ . We set $\vec{o} \bullet \vec{b}=0$ and $\vec{o} \bullet \vec{n}=0$ . Once more, that gives us three unknowns and only two equations. However, we can choose $o_1$ to be whatever we want, which allows us to solve for $\vec{o}$ . We now set the magnitude of $\vec{o}$ to be equal to the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . $\left \| \vec{o} \right \| := \left \| \vec{b} \right \|$ Note that this makes $\vec{o}$ a vector orthogonal to $\vec{b}$ but in the same plane as $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ , whose magnitude is the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . If we take the dot product of $\vec{o}$ and $\vec{c}$ , that gives us the area of the parallelogram created by $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ . That's because $\vec{c} \bullet \vec{o}$ is the magnitude of the projection of $\vec{c}$ onto $\vec{o}$ multiplied by the magnitude of $\vec{o}$ . The projection of $\vec{c}$ onto $\vec{o}$ is the height of the parallelogram with $\vec{b}$ taken as the base, since $\vec{o}$ is orthogonal to $\vec{b}$ . And, the magnitude of $\vec{o}$ is equal to the magnitude of $\vec{b}$ . So, the dot product $\vec{c} \bullet \vec{o}$ is the height times the base, aka the area of the parallelogram created by $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ . Now, we set the magnitude of $\vec{n}$ equal to the area of that parallelogram. $\left \| \vec{n} \right \| :=  \vec{c} \bullet \vec{o} $ And finally, we compute $\vec{a} \bullet \vec{n} $ , and get the determinant of the matrix! Why does this last step work? For the same reason as the previous dot product - $\vec{n}$ is orthogonal to the parallelogram created by $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ . Taking the dot product of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{n}$ is the same thing as taking the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{n}$ and multiplying it by the magnitude of $\vec{n}$ . The projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{n}$ is the height of the parallelepiped, with the parallelogram created by $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ taken to be the base, and the magnitude of $\vec{n}$ is the area of the parallelogram, aka the area of the base. Once again, height times base equals volume. The volume of the parallelepiped is the determinant of the matrix! To conclude, I have two questions: I can see that what he's doing is getting a matrix with $n$ column vectors, calculating the cross-product of the last $n-1$ vectors, and then taking the dot product of the first vector with that cross product. However, how does this connect with the ""normal"" way to calculate determinants? Is there a way to derive the cross-product formula from his method? Secondly, if someone could just carry out the process for $n=4$ , I'd really appreciate it! I'm getting two equations with four unknowns... Thanks! Edit 2: This is just to show what I've done so far, in regards to my second question (the request for someone to take me through this guy's process for a $(4,4)$ matrix) : Calculate $det(\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c},\vec{d})$ Take out the $\vec{a}$ , and calculate $det(\vec{b},\vec{c},\vec{d})$ To do so, we take out the $\vec{b}$ , and calculate $det(\vec{c},\vec{d})$ To do so, we declare an $\vec{n}$ such that $\vec{n} \bullet \vec{c} = 0$ and $\vec{n} \bullet \vec{d} = 0$ . In other words, $\vec{n}$ is orthogonal to the parallelogram created by $\vec{c}$ and $\vec{d}$ . (And here’s where I'm stuck…should $\vec{n}$ be orthogonal to $\vec{a}$ as well? Right now, I have two equations, but four unknowns, and I’m not sure what to do…","['determinant', 'linear-algebra', 'vectors', 'intuition']"

For $f(x)=1$ and $g(x) = x$ , find $\phi(x)$ . For general $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ , find $\phi(x)$ . Comments One source claims that the functional $F$ is called the Rayleigh-Ritz quotient. Some special cases of the original problem can be solved exactly from differential equation, so there is some information regarding the expected solution: For $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=1$ , the function $\phi(x)=C\sin(\pi x)$ corresponds to the exact solution, but not proven in terms of minimizing the functional $F$ . For $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=x$ , a similar case with different boundary condition has the exact solution $\phi(x)$ in the form of Bessel function of the first kind $J_{-1/3}$ . Physically I believe Bessel function should also be the solution form in this case, but mathematically I am not sure. For general $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ , we normally resort to numerical methods such as finite element, because we believe that the closed-form solution is not possible. Here I am asking merely for curiosity. Would it be possible to express $\phi(x)$ in some form, such as using infinite series or special functions?

Show that such a definition indeed obeys the property of an ordered pair. For an additional challenge, show that the alternate definition $(x, y) := \{x, \{x, y\}\}$ also verifies the property and is thus also an acceptable definition of ordered pair. My problem is understanding the difference in the question he is asking. What is the difference between showing the new definition obeys the property and verifying the property? Why will verifying the property help in allowing the new definition to be a acceptable one? Any help answering my questions will be extremely appreciated! :)",['elementary-set-theory']

3285230,Are these continued fractions of integrals known?,"Crossposted on MathOverflow Motivated by Bowman and McLaughlin (2000) on polynomial continued fractions, I considered an extension to functional continued fractions, where the numerator of each fraction is the integral of the previous fraction. That is, define the continued fraction integral transform (CFIT) as \begin{align}\{\mathcal If(t)\}(s)=\dfrac{f(s)}{1+\dfrac{\int_0^s f(x)\,dx}{1+\dfrac{\int_0^s\int_0^u f(x)\,dx\,du}{1+\cdots}}}=\dfrac{f(s)}{1+\dfrac{f^{(-1)}(s)}{1+\dfrac{f^{(-2)}(s)}{1+\cdots}}}={\large{\mathop{\mathrm{K}}_{n=0}^{\infty}}}\frac{f^{(-n)}(s)}1\end{align} where $f\in C^\infty(\Bbb R)$ and $f^{(-k)}$ is Lagrange's notation for the $k$ th antiderivative of $f$ . Some elementary properties of the transform include $\{\mathcal I(0)\}(s)=0$ ; $\{\mathcal If\}(0)=f(0)$ ; $\{\mathcal If\}(s)=\dfrac{f'(s)}{\{\mathcal If'\}(s)}-1$ for all non-constant $f$ such that $f(0)=0$ . Considering the simplest, non-trivial case $f(t)\equiv1$ , we have $f^{(-k)}(t)=t^k/k!$ so that $$\{\mathcal I(1)\}(s)=\dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac s{1+\dfrac{s^2/2!}{1+\cdots}}}.$$ We can see that as $n$ increases, $\mathcal I(1)$ produces more waves. As @PeterForeman mentioned in the comments, the limit $\lim\limits_{s\to-\infty}\mathcal I(1)$ does not exist since it is zero for odd $n$ and $+1$ for even $n$ . However, I believe there are more things that can be investigated. Questions Has the CFIT already been studied/discovered? If so, reference to literature would be appreciated. Going back to the example of $\{\mathcal I(1)\}(s)$ , is it true that the maximum value of each wave increases as $s$ increases up to the first wave? Are there an infinite number of such waves, and is there a closed form for $\max\mathcal I(1)$ ? The period of the oscillations of $\mathcal I(1)$ appears to converge to $$\dfrac4e=1.4715\cdots$$ Can this be proven?

It doesn't seem to fall into either of these three categories: Removable singularity: It's clearly not a removable singularity as $\lim_{z \rightarrow 0} |f(z)| \rightarrow \infty$ Essential singularity: By Casorati-Weierstrass it's not essential singularity either since the image of the unit disc minus the origin is very clearly not dense (it completely misses a ball of radious $.9999$ centered at the origin) Pole : It's not a pole either since it contradicts this theorem because $z^nf(z)$ vanishes at $0$ for all positive integer $n$ : If $f$ has a pole at $0$ then for a neighbourhood of $0$ there's a positive unique  integer $n$ such that $f(z) = h(z) z^{-n}$ and $h(z)$ is holomorphic and nonvanishing in the neighbourhood So what's this singularity ?

Upon substitution I can it into the following forms, although none of these appear to lead to anything promising and Wolfram Alpha seems to be showing the only solution involves the hypergeometric function. Since I have limited knowledge of this and how to arrive at this answer I was wondering if anybody had an easy way to derive this or point me in the right direction for finding a series which this can be expressed as.
