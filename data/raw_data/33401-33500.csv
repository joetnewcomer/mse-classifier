318103,What on earth is the difference between Calculus and Analysis [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Are calculus and real analysis the same thing? (8 answers) Closed 11 years ago . I noticed that there isn't a word for Calculus in my native language, Dutch. So I just went to the English wikipedia entry on Calculus, and tried searching for the Dutch article, and as I suspected, it is non-existent. So I tried the opposite, and went to the Dutch wikipedia entry on calculus. There was a disambiguation page , I clicked on the page concerning mathematics (which exists, to my surprise), and I was redirected to a page named 'Analyse'. When I clicked on the English version, I didn't get Calculus again, but I got mathematical analysis . I already noticed before that these 2 are closely related, when I was shopping for a good (english) calculus textbook. The only thing I found in my research is that Calculus evolved from Analysis, i.e. that Calculus is more basic. But this to me is hard to believe. Some fields of calculus, such are PDEs, are still being developed, so I guess this doesn't perfectly outline the difference between the two. What is the difference?","['soft-question', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
318114,Distribution of $\int_0^t e^s dB(s)$,"Consider $$\left(\int_0^t e^s dB(s)\right)_{t\in [0,1]}$$ where $B$ is a Brownian motion. What is the distribution of this process? Since $f(s) = e^s$ is continuously differentiable, $B$ is process with uncorrelated increments and $\mathbb E [B(t)]\equiv 0$, one can use the fact that $$\int_a^b f(s) dB(s) = f(b)B(b) - f(a)B(a) - \int_a^b B(s)f'(s) ds$$ This reduces in our specific case to $$\int_0^t e^s dB(s) = e^t B(t) - \int_0^t B(s) s e^s ds$$ Now I am stuck to find the distribution of $\int_0^t B(s) s e^s ds$. Is there a convinient way to find its distribution or an easier way to find the distribution of the original process?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-calculus']"

Let $\mathfrak{m}_v = (X_1 - v_1,X_2 - v_2,X_3 - v_3)$ be the ideal in $k[X_1,X_2,X_3]$ corresponding to the polynomials vanishing at $v$. We know that $\mathfrak{m}_v$ is a maximal ideal.

I know that for only two distinct maximal ideals $I,J$, they are necessarily comaximal and we do have $I \cdot J = I \cap J$. However, I'm not sure this generalizes to three ideals, since the product ideals $(I\cdot J)\cdot K$ and $I\cdot J\cdot K$ are seemingly distinct.

318167,Wellordering vs. Zorn's lemma,"Many mathematicians outside mathematical logic dislike wellorderings, ordinals and corresponding transfinite arguments. They use zorn's lemma instead and claim one does not need ordinals at all. Examples are Every vector space has a basis Every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter Hahn-Banach theorem However many cases are not that easy. I often have difficulties to convert a simple proof that uses ordinals and transfinite induction into one using zorn's lemma instead. For example, how would one proove the following assertions with zorn's lemma? $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the union of pairwise disjoint unit-circles.

318206,Need advice: what should be my next step?,"I am dealing with a quite algebraic question and I arrived at some good point. I had $2$ equations with $2$ unknowns and I was able to eleminate one of the variables. My final equation still seems abit ugly but it seems that there is some structure which might be of some help. Here is my final equation: $$\small{D(y_u)=L(y_u)\int_{-\infty}^{-y_u}f_1(y)\mbox{d}y+\frac{L(y_u)}{\left(\sqrt{L(y_u)}+1\right)^2}\int_{-y_u}^{y_u}\left(\sqrt{f_0(y)}+\sqrt{f_1(y)}\right)^2 \mbox{d}y +\int_{y_u}^{\infty}f_1(y)\mbox{d}y-\frac{1}{\left(1-\epsilon\right)^2}\left(\sqrt{L(y_u)}\int_{-\infty}^{-y_u}f_1(y)\mbox{d}y+\frac{\sqrt{L(y_u)}}{\sqrt{L(y_u)}+1}\int_{-y_u}^{y_u}\left(\sqrt{f_0(y)}+\sqrt{f_1(y)}\right)\sqrt{f_1(y)}\mbox{d}y+\int_{y_u}^{\infty}f_1(y)\mbox{d}y\right)^2=0}$$ Here $f_0$ and $f_1$ are some density functions, $y_u\in\mathbb{R}^+$ and $L(y)=\frac{f_1(y)}{f_0(y)}$ is monotinically increasing. Additionally $f_1(y)=f_0(-y)$ and as a result of this we have $L(0)=1$. What I did is as follows: I evaluated the equation in some extreme $y_u$ values. For example when $y_u=0$, I have $L(0)=1$, therefore the equation above simplifies considerably and I get $\epsilon=0$. Similarly, when $\lim_{y_u\rightarrow\infty}D(y_u)$ gives me $$\epsilon_{y_u\rightarrow \infty}=1-\sqrt{\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sqrt{f_0(y)f_1(y)}\mbox{d}y+1}{2}}\geq 0$$ The inequality holds since $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sqrt{f_0(y)f_1(y)}\mbox{d}y\leq 1$ My question: For given densities $f_0$ and $f_1$ the minimum of $\epsilon$ is $0$ and the maximum of $\epsilon$ is reached when ${y_u\rightarrow\infty}$, namely I have 
$$0 \leq\epsilon\leq 1-\sqrt{\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sqrt{f_0(y)f_1(y)}\mbox{d}y+1}{2}}$$ I need to show that when $y_u$ increases from $0$ to $\infty$, $\epsilon$ increases from $0$ to $1-\sqrt{\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sqrt{f_0(y)f_1(y)}\mbox{d}y+1}{2}}$ What should be my next step?

318263,Homework problems for Isaacs' Algebra: A Graduate Course?,"I am about to embark on a journey through Isaacs' Algebra: A Graduate Course.  He provides in the preface a very nice, detailed outline of what he covers while teaching his first-year graduate algebra course.  I would like to follow this outline, and it would be wonderful to actually 'take the course' as much as possible.  So my question is: Where, if anywhere, on the internet could I could access the homework problems assigned for Isaacs' first-year graduate algebra course? I see that he is now retired from University of Wisconsin, Madison, and it appears that his webpage has been taken down from the school site.  A Google search did not yield anything either.  I'm hoping someone may have the homework problems from the course, or know where to find them. I would also like to ask... Would it be reasonable to e-mail Professor Isaacs to ask for the set of homework problems he used? Isaacs' book seems popular and I see that there are several questions on this site on problems from his book, so I think this could very well be of interest to multiple people who use this site. I suppose I would also settle for a different set of problems that closely follows the outline of Isaacs' course, but understandably I'd love to have the problems he used personally.","['reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"
318270,A Cover of an Orientable Manifold is Orientable,"The following question comes from Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by Lee: Suppose $\widetilde{M}$ smoothly covers $M$ where $M$ is orientable. Show that $\widetilde{M}$ is orientable. I think the following proof works: Orientability is equivalent to the existence of a nowhere vanishing continuous top form on $M$, so let $\Omega$ be any such form on $M$. Then the pullback $\pi^*\Omega$ is a top form on $\widetilde{M}$ which cannot vanish ($\pi$ here denotes the smooth covering map). For if it did that would imply that $\Omega$ vanished somewhere. This proof concerns me since I am nowhere using the fact that $\widetilde{M}$ is covering space other than to know that $\pi^*\Omega$ is a top form on $\widetilde{M}$ since $\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism.

318412,Proof of Prime Maker Conjecture,"In my mind the following conjecture is true: Prime Maker Conjecture I call a number $n$ factor-resistant to $q$ if $q\not\mid n$. Considering $n$ as a composite number, the idea is to make $n$ factor-resistant to all of its (prime) factors. When we multiply a number minus or plus $1$ with one of its (prime) factor and then add or subtract 1, the number would become factor-resistant to that (prime) factor. The Algorithm: Let $n=m\mp 1$ ($m$ is even). Perform a primility test on $n$, if $n$ is prime output Prime and exit. Find the smallest prime factor $d_0$ of $n$ Set $m = d_0 \times m$. Set $n= m \pm 1$ Go to Step 2 Example We choose $m=541\#$ ($\#$ is primorial sign) and positive side. $n=541\#+1$ $IsPrime(n)$  ? $n$ is composite $d_0=2879$ $m = 2879 \times 541\#$ $n= m +1$ $IsPrime(n)  ? n$ is composite $d_0=342085039$ $m=342085039\times 2879 \times 541\#$ $n = m + 1$ $IsPrime(n)  ? n$ is prime. Of course the most time consuming step in the algorithm is finding the (smallest) factor, sometimes it makes the algorithm impractical but for a math proof we can think of it as a fast operation.

I decided to take a look at $\mathbb{Q}_5$ for some intuition and thus in this case the remaining solutions are the roots of the equation $x^2+1$ and in the 5-adic numbers $-1$ is representable by $.444...$ and so I'm essentially looking for some infinite non-repeating 5-adic expansion whose square is $-1$.  I really have no idea how one would do this.

(Let $p$ be the support score, $c$ be the opposition score, and $f(p, c)$ be the function that determines the controversy score.) It should have the following properties: Controversy is maximized when equal support is given to both sides. Given that some property $g(p, c)$ is held constant (such that the slope of the tangent line of the level curve of $g(p, c)$ at any point is never positive), $f(p, c)$ should be maximized when $p = c$. More support on both sides means that more people care and therefore there is more controversy. Given that $p/c$ is held constant, a higher value of $p$ or $c$ should result in a higher value of $f(p, c)$. The amount of controversy is the same for the same imbalance of support no matter which side the imbalance favours. $f(p, c)$ should equal $f(c, p)$. All the support being on one side means there is no controversy. Given that either $p$ or $c$ is equal to zero, $f(p, c)$ should be equal to zero.

I know without the re-toss process, the number of balls in the bins must follow the binomial distribution; however, when the re-toss is added, it turns to be quite different.","['stochastic-processes', 'balls-in-bins', 'random', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

318601,How is $\mathrm{PGL}(V)$ a subgroup of $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$?,"I've stumbled upon a strange exercise while reading ""Notes on Infinite Permutation Groups"" by Bhattacharjee, Möller, Macpherson and Neumann. If you have the book, the exercise is 7(ix) on page 66. Let me start with the definitions. Let $F$ be an arbitrary field, and $V$ a finite-dimensional vector space over $F$. Definition 1. A linear transformation on $V$ is a mapping $\varphi :\  V \to V$ such that
$$
(\lambda x +\mu y)\varphi = \lambda (x \varphi) + \mu (y \varphi)
$$
for all $\lambda, \mu \in F$ and all $x, y \in V$. Note that we use notation suitable for right actions here, i.e. we write $x \varphi$ instead of the probably more usual $\varphi(x)$. Also, the composition of transformations is defined accordingly, i.e. $x(\varphi \circ \psi) = (x \varphi)\psi$. The general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ consists of all the invertible linear transformations on $V$. Taking the quotient by the centre, we obtain the projective linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(V) = \mathrm{GL}(V) / Z(\mathrm{GL}(V))$. Definition 2. A semilinear transformation on $V$ is a mapping $\varphi :\ V \to V$ such that there exists an automorphism $\sigma$ of $F$, for which
$$
(\lambda x +\mu y)\varphi = (\lambda^\sigma) (x \varphi) + (\mu^\sigma) (y \varphi)
$$
for all $\lambda, \mu \in F$ and all $x, y \in V$. Not surprisingly, the semilinear group $\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V)$ consists of all the invertible semilinear transformations on $V$, and its quotient by the centre is the projective semilinear group $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V) = \mathrm{\Gamma L}(V) / Z(\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V))$. Here is the exercise that gives me trouble: Show that the group $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ is normal in $\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V)$, and that $\mathrm{PGL}(V)$ is normal in $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$. Work done. I don't have any trouble proving that $\mathrm{GL}(V) \lhd \mathrm{\Gamma L}(V)$, it follows straight from the definitions above. But I'm confused by the second part of the question, the one about projective groups. This is what I don't understand: how can $\mathrm{PGL}(V)$ be a normal subgroup of $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$ if it is not its subgroup in the first place? I don't see a natural way to build an injection from $\mathrm{PGL}(V)$ to $\mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$. It would be easy if this inclusion were true: $Z(\mathrm{GL}(V)) \leq Z(\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V))$. Then I would easily build a map $\alpha: \mathrm{PGL}(V) \to \mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$ that would make the diagram commute:
$$
\newcommand{\ra}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ #1\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex}

\da{ } & & \da{ } \\
\mathrm{PGL}(V) & \ra{\alpha} & \mathrm{P \Gamma L}(V)
\end{array}
$$
where $i$ is inclusion and vertical arrows are factorization. The problem is, $Z(\mathrm{GL}(V)) \not\leq Z(\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V))$ in the general case. To see this, let $V=F$ be a one-dimensional space. Let $\sigma$ be a non-trivial automorphism of the field $F$. Note that $\sigma$ is automatically a semilinear transformation of $V$. Now take $\varphi:\ V \to V$ to be multiplication by $\lambda \in F$, where $\lambda^\sigma \neq \lambda$. Then $\varphi$ commutes with every linear transformation on $V$, but it does not commute with the semilinear $\sigma$. So $\varphi$ belongs to $Z(\mathrm{GL}(V))$, but not to $Z(\mathrm{\Gamma L}(V))$. Is my approach naive? Where should the map $\mathrm{PGL}(V) \to \mathrm{P\Gamma L}(V)$ come from?","['permutations', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory', 'linear-groups']"

If we have the zero element  $0 \in \mathcal{B}(X)$ this should induce a section $\tilde{0} $ of the stalks of $\mathcal{B}$ and should take the value of the zero element in every stalk.

If someone could provide some key points to solving the problem that would be great. Please do not provide the full steps, just key ideas or things to note. Thanks! EDIT: I believe I understand this now because when you take the derivative of a power series you can do it term by term. The power series for $e^x$ is: $$e^x = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ But more expanded it looks like this: $$e^x =  1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} +\ldots $$ If the derivative of each term then I get: $0 + 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \ldots$ So in essence, I'm coming back to the original series.

318820,"Minimizing continuous, convex and coercive functions in non-reflexive Banach spaces","Let $X$ be a infinite dimensional real Banach space. If $X$ is reflexive, then any continuous, convex coervive function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ has a minimum value, that is assumed for some point $x\in X$. This happens because of two motives: 1 - The ball is compact in the weak topology. 2 - $f$ is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous. Note that we can only assume $f$ lower semi continuous to get this result. On the other hand, if $X$ is not reflexive, we don't have 1 and in the same conditions for $f$, it is possible for $f$ not satisfy 2. So my question is: How to construct $f: X\rightarrow 0$ continuous, convex and coercive, with $X$ non-reflexive, and in such a way that $f$ don't attain a minimum value in some point of $X$? More specifically: I- It is possible for $f$ to be unbounded below? II- It is possible for $f$ to be bounded below, but the minimum is not assumed for any point in $x$?

  Assume $E$ has finite measure. Let the sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$ be uniformly integrable over $E$. If $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ pointwise a.e. on $E$, then $f$
  is integrable over $E$. Proof: Let $\delta_0 > 0$ respond to the $\epsilon=1$ challenge in the uniform integrability criteria for the sequence $\{f_n\}$. Since $m(E)< \infty$, we may express $E$ as the disjoint union of a finite collection of measurable subsets $\{E_k\}^N_{k=1}$  such that $m(E_k)<\delta_0$ for $1\leq k \leq N$. For any $n$, by the monotonicity and additivity over domains property of the integral, $$\int_E |f_n| = \sum^N_{k=1} \int_{E_k} |f_n| < N.$$ We infer from Fatou's Lemma that $$\int_E |f| \leq \text{lim inf} \int_E |f_n| \leq N.$$ Thus $|f|$ is integrable over $E$.
