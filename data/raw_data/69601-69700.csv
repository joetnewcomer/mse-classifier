845314,Is there such a thing as 'overtification' (dual to compactification)?,"The dual to the notion of compactness for spaces is overtness. This duality is not manifest in the category of spaces but rather in the quantifiers used to define these notions. Is there a process of 'overtification' corresponding to the process of compactification? Since all topological spaces are overt, this would have to be defined over locales instead. Edit: I've very new to this topic, so I am not well versed. Most of my understanding comes from this Math Overflow answer by Andrej Bauer . I'll mostly reproduce that here, probably more for my benefit than anyone else's. To define overtness, first we must suitable define compactness in a way that can be nicely dualized. If $X$ is a space, let $\mathcal{O}(X)$ be its topology (as a poset) equipped with the Scott topology . Let $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ be the Sierpinski space, with topology $\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}$, which also happens to be the Scott topology on the poset $0 \leq 1$. The Sierpinski space acts as an 'open-set' classifier, meaning that for any open subspace $A \subseteq X$, $\chi^{-1}_A(1) = A$, where $\chi_A$ is the characteristic function 
$$\chi_A(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \in A \\ 0 & \text{if }x\not\in A \end{cases}$$ Anyway, let's look at the function $\forall_X: \mathcal{O}(X) \rightarrow \Sigma$ defined as
$$\forall_X(U) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } U = X \\ 0 & \text{if } U \neq X \end{cases}$$ This map is the universal quantifier over $X$ (hence the $\forall$ symbol), because its value on a subset $U$ is the truth value of the statement $\forall x \in X .(x \in U)$. It is not too hard to see that this is the right adjoint to the frame map $\mathcal{O}(1) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which is the map induced by the unique map $X \rightarrow 1$. (Note that $\mathcal{O}(1) = \Sigma$) We then have: $\textbf{Theorem. }$ A space $X$ is compact if and only if $\forall_X$ is continuous.(This is not obvious to me, but I haven't spent too much time thinking about it) Anyway, now we are ready to dualize. We just have to look for a $\textit{left}$ adjoint to $\Sigma \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(X)$, which we find in 
$$\exists_X(U) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } U = \emptyset \\ 1 & \text{else} \end{cases}$$ The notation is again inspired by the fact that on a subset $U$ the value of $\exists_X$ is the truth value of the statement $\exists x \in X.(x \in U)$. Now we define: $\textbf{Definition.}$ $X$ is overt if and only if $\exists_X$ is continuous. 'Overtification' would then be a nice or natural way to take a frame/locale and 'make it overt' in the way that compactification can take a space and 'make it compact'.

845379,Betting: Gambler's Fallacy vs. Law of Large Numbers,"I know this has been asked before, but I think not in this exact way, so here goes: Suppose you're going to bet on the flip of a coin. Your bet is always ""HEADS"", but the amount of your bet may vary, from 1 dollar to 100 dollars. You have deep pockets, so you can bet on thousands of flips. The first 99 flips were heads. I know that the probability of the coin coming up heads is 0.5, but the probability of the flipper flipping 100 in a row is 1/2^100. Assuming you can make dozens, or hundreds of bets, shouldn't you be betting more on heads at this point? Considering that head/tails average will approach 0.5 for large n, wouldn't it be reasonable to start betting 2 dollars instead of 1 dollar on heads? You're not assuming heads is ""due"", but at some point, with a fair coin, the probability of H/T can be expected to average out. To make this more obvious, suppose the first 99,999 flips have been tails, and the coin is fair. The probability of 100,000 tails is the same as 99,999 tails + 1 heads: 1/2^100000, but if the law of large numbers is correct there must be a time at which it's smarter to bet 2 dollars on heads than 1 dollar on heads. If the wager should be different, is there a way to tell how much larger or smaller the wager should be? I know that the law of large numbers speaks more to the dilution of a run in the overall account, but it would seem that when you're generating a large data set, that you should start regressing to the mean at some point. I've read a little about Bayesian analysis, and I naively assumed that the conditional probability of heads after a run of 99,999 tails should be higher than 0.5. I'm sure I'm wrong, but I need it explained, I guess.","['bayesian', 'law-of-large-numbers', 'probability']"
845400,A Variation on the Coin Problem,"Suppose I have a sequence $a_n$, whose entries are the ordered elements of $S_{x,y}$: $S_{x, y}= \{ z \mid \left( z=n_1x+n_2y \right) \wedge \left( n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N}_1 \right) \wedge \left( \gcd \left( n_1, n_2 \right) = 1  \right)\}$ $x, y \in \mathbb{N}_1$ The Question: Given that $\gcd \left( x, y \right) = 1$, is it true that $a_n - a_{n-1} = 1$ for sufficiently large $n$? In Layman's Terms: This is nearly equivalent to the coin problem , except that my two ""coins"" can only be added in ways where the amounts of each ""coin"" are coprime (in addition to the face values). My Thoughts: My intuition says that there should be a largest unrepresentable value.  Empirical results seem to agree as well.  I am just unsure of how to approach a proof.  The traditional way of proving the coin problem (using some clever modular arithmetic to show that consecutive runs of arbitrary length occur in the sequence) won't work here though.  Clearly this needs to be approached at an entirely different angle, but I don't know where to begin.","['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorial-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

845419,Liouville's theorem and holomorphic function,"I'm working on some practice exams and in one I am looking at the following question: Let $f$ be a function holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$. Suppose that there

We have: $$\lvert f(z) \rvert \leq A + B \lvert z \rvert ^{1/2} ~ ~ ~ \iff ~ ~ ~ \frac{\lvert f(z) \rvert - A}{\lvert z \rvert^{1/2}} \leq B$$ And by the triangle inequality and properties of the complex absolute value: $$\left \lvert \frac{f(z) - A}{z^{1/2}} \right \lvert \leq \frac{\lvert f(z) \rvert - A}{\lvert z \rvert^{1/2}} \leq B$$ By Liouville's theorem, it follows the function: $$\frac{f(z) - A}{z^{1/2}}$$ is constant. Therefore, for some constant $M \in \mathbb{C}$ we have: $$\frac{f(z) - A}{z^{1/2}} = M ~ ~ ~ \implies ~ ~ ~ f(z) = A + M z^{1/2}$$ But $f$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$, whereas $z^{1/2}$ cannot be holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$.

845424,The expected outcome of a random game of chess?,"Imagine a game of chess where both players generate a list of legal moves and pick one uniformly at random. Q : What is the expected outcome for white? 1 point for black checkmated, 0.5 for a draw, 0 for white checkmated.  So the expected outcome is given by $$\mathrm{Pr}[\text{black checkmated}]+0.5\ \mathrm{Pr}[\text{draw}].$$ Neither player resigns, nor are there any draw offers or claims. As a chess player, I'm curious if white (who plays first) has some advantage here. I'm not expecting an exact answer to be possible.  Partial results (e.g. that the expectation is >0.5) and experimental results are welcome.  (The expectation is not 0 or 1, since there are possible games where white does not win and where black does not win.) I'm guessing this has been looked at before, so I decided to ask first (rather than implement a chess engine that makes random moves and hope to find something other than ""draw, draw, draw, draw, ..."").  Searching for ""random game of chess"" lists Chess960 and other randomized variants, which is not what I want. Technicalities: En passant capturing, castling, pawn promotion, etc. all apply as usual.

  consecutive alternate moves by each player. b. any consecutive
  series of 75 moves have been completed by each player without the
  movement of any pawn and without any capture. If the last move
  resulted in checkmate, that shall take precedence. This means that games of chess must be finite, and thus there is a finite number of possible games of chess.","['recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"

If $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a\ne0$, let $L_{a,b}:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the function given by $L_{a,b}(x) = ax+b$ for all $x$.

This is exercise 1.4.2 in Introduction to Analysis by Arthur P. Mattuck. The hint given in the book is ""Show that $a_{n} > n$"". I attempted to show this using induction. Basic Step $a_{1} = \frac{1^{1}}{1} = 1 \not > 1$ $a_{2} = \frac{2^{2}}{2} = 2 \not > 2$ $a_{3} = \frac{3^{3}}{3} = \frac{9}{2} > 3$ Inductive Step Show $\frac{n^{n}}{n!} > n \implies \frac{(n+1)^{(n+1)}}{(n+1)!} > n+1$ This is where I get stuck.

845851,Rotation number of inverse maps on the circle.,"I'm still a bit lost in my studies of rotation numbers. Any help is much appreciated! Let's say we have a homeomorphism $F: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is a lift of a homeomorphism $f:S^1 \rightarrow S^1$ of the circle. The homeo $f$ is assumed to be orientation preserving, i.e. $F(x+1) = F(x) +1$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The rotation number 
$$
\rho(F,x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{F^n(x) - x}{n}
$$
exists for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and is constant, i.e. $\rho(F,x) = \rho(F,y)$ for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $F^{-1}$ be the inverse of $F$. I know that $\rho(F^{-1},x)$ also exists for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. What I want to show now is that
$$
\rho(F,x) + \rho(F^{-1},x) = 0 \quad\text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}.
$$
Somehow I am still stuck. What I managed so far was to calculate
$$
\frac{F^n(x) - x}{n} = -\frac{x - F^n(x)}{n} = -\frac{F^{-n} \circ F^n(x) - F^n(x)}{n}. 
$$
This almost looks like a solution to me since if I can show that if the right hand side
$\frac{F^{-n} \circ F^n(x) - F^n(x)}{n}$ converges to $\rho(F^{-1},x)$ for $n \rightarrow \infty$, I am done. I know already that this term is convergent because the left hand side is convergent. I also now that for every fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the term
$$ 
\frac{F^{-n} \circ F^k(x) - F^k(x)}{n} \quad\text{converges to } \rho(F^{-1}) \text{ for }  n \rightarrow \infty.

Defining $\beta X$ as $\beta X = \overline{\varepsilon_X (X)}$ we obtain the Stone–Čech compactificationwith the pair $(\beta X, \varepsilon_X)$. To have a compactification we need that $X$ is a Hausdorff space, $\beta X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $\varepsilon_X$ be a homeomorphism between $X$ and a dense subspace of $\beta X$.

846011,Precise definition of the support of a random variable,"$\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}} \newcommand{\powset}[1]{\mathcal{P}(#1)}$ I am reading lecture notes which contradict my understanding of random variables.

If we take the standard definition of a random variable $X$ , it is actually a function from the sample space to real values, i.e. $X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ . What now confuses me is the precise definition of the term support . According to Wikipedia : the support of a function is the set of points where the function is
  not zero valued. Now, applying this definition to our random variable $X$ , these lectures notes say: Random Variables – A random variable is a real valued function defined
  on the sample space of an experiment. Associated with each random 
  variable is a probability density function (pdf) for the random
  variable. The  sample space is also called the support of a random
  variable. I am not entirely convinced with the line the sample space is also callled the support of a random variable . Why would $\Omega$ be the support of $X$ ? What if the random variable $X$ so happened to map some element $\omega \in \Omega$ to the real number $0$ , then that element would not be in the support? What is even more confusing is, when we talk about support, do we mean that of $X$ or that of the distribution function $\Pr$ ? This answer says that: It is more accurate to speak of the support of the distribution than
  that of the support of the random variable. Do we interpret the support to be the set of outcomes in $\Omega$ which have a non-zero probability, the set of values that $X$ can take with non-zero probability?

846172,Connections and dependences between topological and algebraic basis in topological vector space,"On my last functional analysis exam, one of the tasks was to show that if normed vector space $X$ have countable Hamel basis , then $X$ is separable space (over field $\mathbb{R}$). I am not sure if what I did was correct, but I started from using fact (and sketched proof of it) that in metric spaces separability is equivalent to existence of countable (topological) base. Then, I was trying to show that if normed space have countable Hamel base  $\mathscr{B}$, then it have countable open (topological) base. I wanted to do something like this: Let's consider arbitrary $ x \in Lin \{ \mathscr{B} \} \cap {???}$  (there is more than countable many of them in $Lin \{ \mathscr{B} \}$... but maybe I can somehow fix it, for example taking only linear combinations for rational coefficients, or intersect it with some countable $???$ set?) and arbitrary positive rational $r \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then, we have (we have not (!!), but we will have after fixing what I mentioned above) countable number of balls 
  $$B(x,r) = \{ y \in Lin \{ \mathscr{B} \} \cap {???} : ||x-y || < r \}$$
  and all these balls makes topological basis of our vector space $X$. I know that this sketch above looks a little chaotic, but can we accomplish something like that? (build countable number of balls, which make topological base of our space, using countable Hamel base in normed space?)
If yes, how should I correctly construct them? Or there's also some other and easier way to do this task? And here's where my second question, even more important (stronger) arrives. We can even say that this is the main purpose of this almost ""essay"" I just wrote above.

Do you know any dependences between algebraic and topological bases of the same space? Do they always must to have equal powers? Are there some interesting properties, connections, or possible differences in some of these properties between them? How much does it differ between linear topological spaces and linear topological spaces which are metrizable, normable, etc.?

846188,Geometric generalizations of the arithmetic and geometric means,"Given a set of $3$ positive real numbers $\{a, b, c \}$, one way of interpreting the geometric mean is that it is the answer to the following question: Find the edge length $\mu_3$ of a cube whose volume is equal to that of a rectangular solid with edge lengths $a, b,$ and $c$. (Here the subscript ""$3$"" indicates that we are trying to equalize volume , a 3-dimensional measure.)  Similarly one way of interpreting the arithmetic mean is that it is the answer to the following question: Find the edge length $\mu_1$ of a cube whose total linear measure (i.e. the sum of the lengths of all edges) is equal to that of a rectangular solid with edge lengths $a, b,$ and $c$. As soon as one notices these geometric interpretations, the following immediately suggests itself as an obvious related question: Find the edge length $\mu_2$ of a cube whose surface area is equal to that of a rectangular solid with edge lengths $a, b,$ and $c$. Solving this problem, one finds that
$$\mu_2 = \sqrt{ \frac{ab+ac+bc}{3}}$$
a formula which is a kind of hybrid of the formulas for the AM and GM. Generalizing, for a set of $n$ positive real numbers, one can define $n$ different types of ""mean"", each answering a question of the following type: Find the edge length $\mu_k$ of an $n$-dimensional hypercube whose $k$-dimensional measure (i.e. the sum of the measures of the $k$-dimensional subcubes) is equal to that of the hypersolid whose edge lengths are $a_1, a_2, \ldots a_3$. So for example, with $n=4$ there are four different ""means"" of the set $\{a,b,c,d\}$: $\mu_1(a,b,c,d)=\frac{a+b+c+d}{4}$ is just the arithmetic mean of the four numbers. $\mu_2(a,b,c,d) = \sqrt{ \frac{ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd}{6} }$ equalizes the $2$-measure $\mu_3(a,b,c,d) = \sqrt[3] {\frac {abc + abd + acd + bcd}{4} }$ equalizes the $3$-measure $\mu_4(a,b,c,d) = \sqrt[4] {abcd}$ is just the geometric mean of the four numbers. In general,
$$\mu_k(a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n) = \sqrt[k]{\frac{\sum \text{all products of } k \text{ members of the set} \{a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n\} }{C_{n,k}}}$$ Okay, my questions: Do these generalized means have a name?

And I have an inkling that Category Theory can make the relationship explicit. Functors preserves isomorphisms in general, so if I can find a combination of functors which preserve epimorphisms and monomorphisms in a convenient way, we can actually show that the first theorem implies the second. I know there is an adjoint pair $G\dashv F$ where $F$ is the forgetful functor from Vect $_K$ to Set and $G$ is the functor which sends a set to the free vector space generated by it. And I also know that both $F$ and $G$ are faithful (but not in general full). But I am having difficulty in getting these facts to work together nicely. Any help in making my ideas rigorous, or an explanation why I'm barking up the wrong tree, is appreciated. EDIT If we considered the free v.s. functor from FinSet to FinVect $_K$, we will then have a faithful functor. Since faithful functors reflect monomorphisms and epimorphisms, if we can find a parallel mono (or epic) map that is in the range of the free v.s. functor for every mono (or epic) map we encounter, we'd be able to show the 1st theorem implies the 2nd. Using the fact that vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic, we can conclude that the free v.s. functor is also dense. Hence if $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces of the same dimension, and $m:V\hookrightarrow W$ we'd be done if we can find an $f:X\rightarrow Y$ which makes the following diagram commute: $\hskip2in$ I'm sure a clever choice of bases on $V$ and $W$ and subsequent choices for the isomorphisms would make this possible, but these choices essentially use the 2nd theorem.

But after the birth of quantum physics, they found that a thing as real as ""matter"" itself had to be described by complex wave functions and there's no way to describe it using only real numbers. In mathematics, in real analysis, there's examples like the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ , and why this function does not have the ""smoothness"" of the exponential function, polynomials, or the sine and cosine functions, why it has a radius of convergence equals 1 despite the fact that this function is infinitely differentiable. You can't see the reality of this function until you see it through the field of complex analysis, where you can observe that $f$ is not that smooth because it has 2 singularities in the complex plane. I am just asking for examples like this such that when you see it in the narrow ""window"" of real analysis, you can't see the ""reality"" until you view it from the window of complex analysis. I am just starting to self learn complex analysis and I find it more natural than real analysis and it tells you the ""truth"" behind a lot of things.","['self-learning', 'philosophy', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

846395,Combinatorics and symmetric functions,"(The actual questions in this posting are at the bottom.) Occasionally someone asks here how to show that every nonempty finite set has just as many subsets of odd cardinality as of even cardinality (the empty set is the unique exception).  When the set has an odd number of members, a correspondence between complements does it, but generally, one picks a distinguished element.  Every set containing the distinguished element corresponds to one not containing it, and that's the bijection. Now let's take it a step further and say one adds a new element to the set, which will be ""distinguished"" until the next new one gets added. $$
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{odd} & \text{even} \\
\hline
a & \text{---} \\
b & ab \\
c & ac \\
abc & bc
\end{array}
$$
Now add the new element $d$:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{odd} & \text{even} \\
\hline
a & \text{---} \\
b & ab \\
c & ac \\
abc &bc \\
\hline
d & ad \\
abd & bd \\
acd& cd \\
bcd& abcd
\end{array}
$$
Those listed on the odd side get re-listed on the even side and vice-versa, and the new element is added to both. Suppose that as above we let multiplication denoted by juxtaposition represent a set of ur-elements, and addition represent a set of sets, so the first table above has $a+b+c+abc$ as its left column and $1+ab+ac+ad$ as its second column, the $1$ being the product of members of the empty set.  If, further, we represent the whole table as a fraction with the odd column as the numerator and the even column as the denominator, then the operation of adding the new element is this:
$$
\frac{\frac{a+b+c+abc}{1+ab+ac+bc}+d}{1+\frac{a+b+c+abc}{1+ab+ac+bc}d}
= \frac{a+b+c+d+abc+abd+acd+bcd}{1+ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd+abcd}.
$$
So we're working with a binary operation: $a\,\diamondsuit\, b=\dfrac{a+b}{1+ab}$.  When the set we start with is empty, the the numerator is the sum of $0$ terms and is $0$ and the denominator is the product of $0$ terms and $\text{is }1$. QUESTIONS: Does this algebraic way of looking at this shed light on the combinatorics, or vice-versa? What is the combinatorial meaning of the fact that the binary operation is associative? I tried this with the even terms in the numerator and odd in the denominator: $a\,\spadesuit\, b$.  We get $(a\,\spadesuit\,b)\,\spadesuit\,c =a\,\diamondsuit\,b\,\diamondsuit\,c$; and $(a_1\,\diamondsuit\,\cdots\,\diamondsuit\,a_n)\,\spadesuit\, a_{n+1} = 1/(a_1\,\diamondsuit\,\cdots\,\diamondsuit\,a_{n+1})$ --- So if you apply the $\spadesuit$ operation instead of $\diamondsuit$ each time a new element is added, then you alternate between odd-in-the-numerator-and-even-in-the-denominator and even-in-the-numerator-and-odd-in-the-denominator. Does the alternation have some combinatorial significance?","['symmetric-polynomials', 'combinatorics']"
846442,Generating function: Probability regarding coin toss,"If a coin is flipped 25 times with eight tails occurring, what is the probability that no run of six (or more) consecutive heads occur?

My attempted work: Consider $e_H,e_T$ s.t $e_H$ denotes the number of times our coin lands on heads and $e_T$ is the number of times our coin lands on tails. We want the number of integer solutions to: 
  $$e_H+e_T=25$$
  where $e_H \in [9,25]$ and $e_T=8$. It follows that our generating function $h$ is
  $$h(x)=(x^9+x^{10}+...x^{25})x^8$$
  where we want to find the coefficient of $x^{25}$. Now, observe that $h$ can re-written as
  $$h(x)=x^{17}(1+x+...x^{16})$$
  where we want to find the coefficient of $x^{16}$ now. Using the formula for finite geometric series, we see that $h$ becomes 
  $$h(x)=x^{17}(\frac{1-x^{17}}{1-x})$$
  $$=x^{17}(1-x^{17})(\frac{1}{1-x})$$
  where using the formula for infinite geometric series gives us
  $$x^{17}(1-x^{17})(1+x+...+x^n+...)$$
  Finally, using the formula $h(x)=f(x)g(x)=c_0 + c_1x+...+c_rx^r+...$ where $c_r=a_0b_r+a_1b_{r-1}+...a_rb_0$, we find 
  $$f(x)=(1-x^{17}),g(x)=(1+x+...)$$
  $$\implies a_0b_16=1*1=1$$

846556,Why is the Plancherel measure interesting?,"One can average a class function $f:G\to\Bbb C$ for a finite group $G$ by interpreting $f$ as a complex-valued function on the space ${\rm cl}(G)$ of conjugacy classes and computing the expectation $\Bbb E(f(C))$, where $C$ is a class-valued random variable whose distribution is pulled from the uniform one on $G$. In light of $\sum(\dim\rho)^2=|G|$ (where the sum is over complex irreps $\rho$), we could equally attach the weights $(\dim\rho)^2/|G|$ to irreps and turn $\widehat{G}$ into a probability space. This is how we get the Plancherel measure on a finite group. But what question is the Plancherel measure an answer to? Historically, we know the Lebesgue and more generally the Haar measure answer the question of translation-invariant measures, and do so nicely (existence and uniqueness). Is there some a priori system of nice properties we might have liked a measure on irreps to have, which we could have later discovered the Plancherel measure uniquely satisfies? For $G$ locally compact abelian, the complex irreps comprising $\widehat{G}$ are $1$-dimensional and form a group under tensoring - this is just the dual group, which has its own topology (the compact-open topology), and the Plancherel measure is just the Haar measure. However if $G$ is nonabelian, the irreps can be higher-dimensional and so aren't closed under tensor product. (Pontryagin duality generalizes to Tannaka-Krein duality, where we look at symmetry of the tensor operation on the full category of reps to recover $G$, at least as I understand it.) I may be muddying the waters with infinite nonabelian $G$ though, as I don't know how to define the Plancherel measure in that context. We know conjugacy classes are dual to irreducible representations (see Qiaochu's answer here ; the tl;dr version is that they are identified with the maxspecs of two algebras in a dual pairing). They are not generally in bijection, but one situation where they are in bijection is with finite symmetric groups. There might be some process that is ""dual"" to averaging class functions (which is where the boring measure on the set of conjugacy classes appears) in which the Plancherel measure is useful. This could also potentially explain why there are applications of the Plancherel  measure on symmetric groups to combinatorial/probabilistic questions but I haven't seen any applications with other groups.","['measure-theory', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
846563,Using normal families to bound a complex integral,"I am trying to prove that $$\int_{\partial T(Q)} |F'(z)| \,ds(z) \lesssim \int\int_{T(Q)} |F'(z)| |\varphi'(z)|^2 \log \frac{1}{|z|} \,dx\, dy$$ This is an estimate on page $6$ of this paper by Peter Jones, and the author states that this follows ""by normal families and"" and knowing that $\varphi'$ has Bloch norm at most $6$. The symbol $\lesssim$ means $\le$ with constants that should not depend on $F$, $\varphi$ or $Q$. For notation, $F$ is a Riemann map (i.e. conformal equivalence) between the disk and some other simply connected region whose boundary has finite length (so that $F'$ is in the Hardy class $H^1$). Then $\varphi$ is a logarithm of $F'$, sot hat $e^{\varphi} = F'$; earlier in the paper, it's noted that $\varphi$ has Bloch norm at most $6$, i.e.
$$|\varphi'(z)| \le 6 (1 - |z|^2)^{-1}$$ We can decompose the circle $T$ into dyadic arcs $I$ of length $\pi 2^{-n}$, and define ""squares"" $$Q = Q_I = \left\{z : \frac{z}{|z|} \in I, 1 - \pi 2^{-n} \le |z| \le 1\right\}$$ (so that $Q$ is part of a sector of the circle, and its ""side-lengths"" are all comparable). Let $z_{Q}$ be the center of this region, and $T_Q$ it upper half - i.e. $\{z \in Q : 1 - \pi 2^{-n} \le |z| \le 1 - \pi 2^{-n - 1}\}$. Finally, assume that there exists a $z \in T_Q$ with $|\varphi(z) - \varphi(z_Q)| \ge \epsilon$. I believe this is necessary - in the extreme case, when $\varphi$ is constant, the right-hand integral is $0$ while the left is not. My question : I don't see what is meant by ""by normal families"" here, or what normal family is being considered here. If anyone could clarify this statement, or point out some general theorem this is referencing (or refer me to a similar, but wordier proof), I would greatly appreciate it. Remark This is somewhat similar to an inequality proved earlier in the paper, namely $$\int\int_{\mathbb D} |F'(z)| |\varphi'(z)|^2 \log \frac{1}{|z|} dx dy \le 4 \int_{T} |F'(e^{i\theta})| \,d\theta$$ which follows from Green's formula via $$\int_T |G(e^{i\theta}) - G(0)|^2 d\theta = \int\int_{\mathbb{D}} |G'(z)|^2 \log \frac{1}{|z|} \,dx\, dy$$
where $G$ is a square root of $F'$. However, the inequality here goes in the other direction.","['complex-analysis', 'normal-families', 'harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The article was being published in the journal ""Advances in Mathematics"" Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 233-413 (July 1969). One can find the article from the link http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00018708/3/3 I quote from the article: Thus we are led to associate with every variety $V$ a ring of finite type $A = K[X_1, \dots, X_n]/\mathfrak a$ , where, for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the field $K$ is algebraically closed. Our problem is to establish a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic and geometric objects. Given a point $z\in V$ , we associate with it the set of all functions on $V$ which vanish at $z$ ; this set is a maximal ideal in $A$ . A subvariety $W$ of $V$ is defined by an ideal $\mathfrak b$ which contains $\mathfrak a$ : the set of all functions on $V$ which vanish on $W$ forms an ideal in $A$ , and we associate this ideal with the subvariety $W$ . In the opposite direction, given an algebraically closed field $K$ and a ring of finite type $A = K[X_1, \dots, X_n]/\mathfrak a$ , we want to associate with it a variety $V$ . By what precedes, it is natural to consider as the points of $V$ the elements of the maximal spectrum $\operatorname{Specm}(A)$ of $A$ , i.e., the maximal ideals of $A$ . This, however, will certainly not give a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic and geometric objects, since to any field $K$ there would correspond the variety consisting of one point. A way to correct this situation is again suggested by Riemann’s approach who considered the rings $A_z$ formed by the functions on $V$ which have no poles at $z$ . Thus we should take as elements of the geometric object we want to associate with the ring $A$ , the pairs $(\mathfrak m, A_{\mathfrak m})$ , where $\mathfrak m$ is a maximal ideal of $A$ and $A_{\mathfrak m}$ is the local ring at $\mathfrak m$ . In this way, for different fields we obtain different pairs $(z, K)$ . I don't understand “This, however, will certainly not give a one-to-once correspondence between algebraic and geometric objects,since to any field $K$ there would correspond the variety consisting of one point.” and whatever he says after that about considering the local ring at a maximal ideal.

EDIT: I also tried to find the supremum of $n^2x(1-x)^n$..I found that $f(x)=n^2x(1-x)^n$ achieves its maximum at the point $\frac{1}{n+1}$ and that $\sup_{x \in [0,1]} n^2x(1-x)^n=\frac{n}{e} \to +\infty$ Could you tell me if it is right?",['limits']
847021,Trying to prove $\liminf (A_n) \subseteq \limsup (A_n)$,"I am trying to show that for a sequence of sets $(A_n)$ $$ \liminf (A_n) \subseteq \limsup (A_n)$$ I can see why this is true intuitively as follows - $x \in \liminf (A_n)$ $\implies x$ is an element of all but finitely many of the $A_n$'s $\implies x$ is an element of infinitely many of the $A_n$'s $\implies x \in \limsup (A_n)$ However I want to show it formally using set notation. Here is what I have so far. $x \in \liminf(A_n)$ $\implies x \in \bigcup_n \bigcap_{k \ge n} A_k$ $\implies x \in \bigcap_{k \ge n_0} A_k$ for some $n_0$ $\implies x \in \big(\bigcup_{1 \le j < n_0} A_j\big) \bigcup \big(\bigcap_{k \ge n_0} A_k \big)$ for some $n_0$ $\implies x \in \big(\bigcup_{1 \le j < n_0} A_j\big) \bigcup \big(\bigcup_{k \ge n_0} A_k \big)$ for some $n_0$ But I am not sure how to proceed from here. It seems like the $n_0$ is now 'redundant' as we have a statement saying that $x$ is an element least one $A_k$ whether that $A_k$ is 'before, equal to or after' $A_{n_0}$ in the sequence $(A_n)$. But this leads to $\implies x \in \bigcup_n A_n$ which just says $x$ is an element of at least one of the infinitely many $A_n$, whereas I need to show that $x$ occurs infinitely often. Where am I going wrong?","['measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'limsup-and-liminf']"

847076,Ways to sum to $n$ with $m$ integers that are $\le k$,"Given three natural numbers $n$, $m$ and $k$, how many ways are there to write $n$ as the sum of $m$ natural numbers in the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, k\}$, where order does matter ? I've seen the ""Ways to sum $n$ with $k$ numbers"", but never where the different numbers are restricted by an upper bound. I'm not even sure how to proceed with this question. I have a python script to calculate this (in essence, it tries the $(k+1)^m$ possible sums, computes them, and returns the number of sums whose result is $n$). I do have some recurrence equations, but I'm almost 100% sure they don't help that much. By fixing the first number of the sum to be $0, 1, \ldots, k$, and writing $P(n, m, k)$ as the solution of the problem: P(n, m, k) = P(n,     m - 1, k) + # If the first number is 0
             P(n - 1, m - 1, k) + # If the first number is 1

I'd like to prove that $X$ is metrizable. So, let $$d(x,y)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k}\frac{p_k(x-y)}{1+p_k(x-y)}.$$
It is easy to see that $d$ is a metric indeed. I'd like to prove that this is a one we need, that generates the original convergence. Is that true by the way? Let $x_n\to x$ in the introduced metric. Then for all $k$ we have $\frac{1}{2^k}\frac{p_k(x_n-x)}{1+p_k(x_n-x)}\le d(x_n,x)$ and thus $p_k(x_n-x)\to 0$ for each $k$. The last means the convergence in the original locally convex topology. How to do the converse? So, suppose $p_k(x_n-x)\to 0$ ($n\to \infty$) for each $k$. How can I prove that $d(x_n,x)\to 0$. Althouhg it seems to be an elementary mathematical analysis, could you tell me wheather the metric I inroduce suits us and how to prove that if yes?","['topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

847162,mid-point convex but not a.e. equal to a convex function,"I recently stumbled upon Wikipedia's page on convexity ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function#Properties ) and there's reference to Sierpinski's theorem from which we can deduce that for Lebesgue measurable functions mid-point convexity implies convexity. For reference: mid-point convexity means
$$f\left(\frac{1}{2} x + \frac{1}{2} y\right) \leq \frac{f(x) + f(y)}{2} \ldotp$$ Now, the question is: how pathological has to be an example of a mid-convex function that is not convex? The usual examples usually do something like 'put one value on rationals, different on non-rationals' but that won't work here, since such a function is a.e. equal to a convex, constant function. I understand that since the function can't be measurable it has to be pretty weird, but how weird exactly in this case? The only related question I've found is this one: Mid-point convexity does not imply convexity but it doesn't contain any examples, there's just a remark mentioning Sierpinski's result in the comments.","['convex-analysis', 'examples-counterexamples', 'functions']"
