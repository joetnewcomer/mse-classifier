My textbook says $f^{-1}(x)=\ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})$, but I haven't been able to get that answer. Switching $x$ and $y$, I tried solving for $y$ a few different ways, with limited success. Initially, I tried: $$x=\frac{e^y-e^{-y}}{2}\\
2x=e^y-e^{-y}\\
2x=e^{-y}(e^{2y}-1)\\
\ln(2x)=\ln(e^{-y}(e^{2y}-1))\\

\ln(2x)=-y+\ln(e^{2y}-1)\\
\ln(2x)=-y+\ln((e^y-1)(e^y+1))\\
\ln(2x)=-y+\ln(e^y-1)+\ln(e^y+1)$$ I can't see anything else I could do with that. I also tried squaring both sides back on that first line, but it lead me down another dead-end. The only thing that seemed to yield an answer was: $$x=\frac{e^y-e^{-y}}{2}\\
2x=e^y-e^{-y}\\
2x=e^y-\frac{1}{e^y}\\
2x=\frac{e^{2y}-1}{e^y}\\

0=e^{2y}-2xe^y-1\\
(e^y)^2-2x(e^y)-1=0$$

e^y=x\pm \sqrt{2}\\
y=\ln(x\pm \sqrt{2})$$ I'm not sure what to do about the $\pm$.

339672,Is it possible that $f(x)$ and $f(x^{\alpha})$ are both completely monotone,"Let $f(x)$ be a completely monotone function on $x>0$, i.e. $f(x) \in C^{\infty}(0,+\infty)$ and for any $n \geqslant 0$ we have
$$
   (-1)^n \frac{\mathsf d^n f(x)}{\mathsf dx^n} \geqslant 0, \tag{1}
$$
and let $f(0) = f(+0) = 1$, but $f(x) \not\equiv 1$. Is it possible that $f(x^{\alpha})$ is also completely monotone for some $\alpha>0$, $\alpha \neq 1$? We can test inequalities $(1)$ for $f(x^{\alpha})$ but in this case we will obtain an infinite system of differential inequalities that seems insolvable. The other way is to use the Bernstein theorem on monotone functions that states that if $f(x)$ is completely monotone then there exists a Borel nonnegative measure $\mu$ on $[0,+\infty)$, $\mu[0,+\infty) = f(+0)$ and such that
$$
   f(x) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-xy} \, \mathsf d \mu(y). \tag{2}
$$
If $f(x^{\alpha})$ is also completely monotone then there exists some measure $\nu(x)$ such that
$$
   f(x^{\alpha}) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-xy} \, \mathsf d \nu(y). \tag{3}
$$
From $(2)$ and $(3)$ it follows that
$$
   \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^{\alpha} y} \, \mathsf d \mu(y) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x y} \, \mathsf d \nu(y).
$$
and without loss of generality $\alpha > 1$ (otherwise we can introduce $\tilde{\alpha} = \alpha^{-1}$ and $\tilde{x} = x^{\alpha}$). On the right hand side we have a completely monotone function. Then on the left hand side the function is also completely monotone and by virtue of the Bernstein theorem it satisfies $(1)$. Let's take it derivatives up to second order and write inequalities $(1)$:
$$
     -\alpha \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} x^{\alpha-1} y e^{-x^{\alpha}y} \, \mathsf d\mu(y) \leqslant 0,  - \,\text{it is always true} \\
     -\alpha x^{\alpha-2} \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} y \left( \alpha-1 - \alpha yx^{\alpha} \right) e^{-x^{\alpha}y} \, \mathsf d\mu(y) \geqslant 0. 
$$
Let's divide the last inequality by $-\alpha x^{\alpha-2}$ and rewrite as
$$
   (\alpha-1) \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} y e^{-x^{\alpha} y} \, \mathsf d \mu(y) \leqslant \alpha x^{\alpha} \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} y^2 e^{-x^{\alpha} y} \, \mathsf d \mu(y).
$$
If $y^2$ is integrable with respect to $\mu$ then we can pass to the limit $x \to +0$ to obtain the contradiction: on the left hand side we will obtain a positive number whereas on the right hand side it will be zero. For more general classes of measure $\mu$ that represents completely monotone function $f$ this proof of the fact that $f(x)$ and $f(x^{\alpha})$ can not both be completely monotone nonconstant functions doesn't work.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

So understanding the distinction between these terms by solely examining the words themselves is somewhat baffling to me. If we talk about a function mapping some set $A$ (endowed with some binary operation ""+"") to some set $B$ (with a binary operation ""*""), then I interpret a ""homomorphism"" to be a function which preserves the ""form"" in the sense that it preserves the structure of the operations, i.e. for all $x,y$ in $A$, $f(x+y) = f(x)*f(y)$. I think of a function which is a homeomorphism as a function which preserves ""form"" in the sense that both $f$ and its inverse preserves the basic fundamental topological properties of sets, i.e. both $f$ and its inverse map open sets to open sets. I am just curious if someone with a better understanding of these terms can shed some light on why I should think of ""homomorphism"" and ""homeomorphism"" as being different in some sense (other than falling back on the fact that they are just definitions) and if so, how one can see this distinction from the words themselves.

By the semidirect product of H and K with respect to α, written $H \rtimes_α K$ , we mean the set H×K with the binary operation given by setting $(h_1, k_1) · (h_2, k_2) = (h_1 · α(k_1)(h_2), k_1k_2)$ . For a splitting, it says: A section, or splitting, for f : G → K is a homomorphism s : K → G, such that f ◦ s is the identity map of K. A homomorphism f : G → K that admits a section is said to be a split surjection. An extension of H by K is called a split extension if f : G → K admits a section.
The section s is said to split f. For an extension, it says: Let H and K be groups. An extension of H by K consists of a group G containing H as a normal subgroup, together with a surjective homomorphism f : G → K with kernel H. Also, in a proposition, it says that split extensions are semidirect products. But I'm not sure how an extension can ""fit"" the definition of a semidirect product. Also, I think I have trouble understanding the relationship between these two when it comes to classifying groups. For semidirect products, I understand that semidirect products are not unique, so classifying them means looking at the possibilities of what groups a semidirect product might represent up to isomorphism. Is that correct? But what do extensions have to do with this?","['semidirect-product', 'group-extensions', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

In that case, $M'$ is homeomorphic to $X$ via $x\mapsto\hat{x}$. My thoughts about this problem are as follows: (1) Bounded continuous functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ have unique continuous extensions to $\beta X$. Perhaps this enables identification of $C(\beta X,\mathbb{R})$ with $BC(X,\mathbb{R})$, and thus identification of $M$ with the set of nonzero algebra homomorphisms from $C(\beta X,\mathbb{R})$ to $\mathbb{R}$. (2) The set of nonzero algebra homomorphisms from $C(\beta X,\mathbb{R})$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is homeomorphic to $\beta X$.

339956,Different definitions of handle attachment,"This is an extremely technical question about handle attachments.  I am asking why two definitions are equivalent.  My question appears in the second to last paragraph after I've described the two procedures whose equivalence I want to prove. In the book ""Differential Manifolds"" by Antoni Kosinski, the following procedure is given for attaching two smooth n-manifolds $N_1, N_2$ along submanifolds of their boundaries: Let $E := E' \oplus \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ be the ""upper half"" of a rank n-m riemannian vector bundle over a smooth m- manifold $M$ and let $\phi_i : E \rightarrow N_i$   be imbeddings extending imbeddings $E' \rightarrow \partial N_i$. Now if $\alpha$ is any orientation reversing diffeomorphism $(0,\infty) \rightarrow (0, \infty )$, we make the following identifications:  $x \rightarrow \phi_2\{ \alpha (|\phi_1^{-1}(x)|) \frac{ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}{|\phi_1^{-1}(x)|}\}$ when $x \in \phi_1 (E- M)$ ( I.e. $x$ is an element of the first tubular neighborhood minus the zero section) The quotient space of $N_1 - \phi_1 (M) \sqcup N_2 -\phi_2 (M)$ under this identification is then the desired manifold. Kosinski then says that ""attaching a handle"" to a manifold N is just a special case of the above when $N_1 = N$ and $N_2 = \mathbb{D}^n$ but his definition is a bit different:  Let $n= \lambda + \mu$ and write $x \in \mathbb{D}^n$ as $x = (x_\lambda, x_\mu)$. For $0\leq \epsilon < 1$,  Let $T(\epsilon)  := \{ x \in \mathbb{D}^n : |x_\lambda|^2 > \epsilon \}$ .  Now the analogue of the involution map $\alpha$ in the above paragraph is the map $\beta : T(\epsilon)-S^{\lambda-1} \rightarrow T(\epsilon)-S^{\lambda-1}$ given by $(x_\lambda, x_\mu) \mapsto (\frac{x_\lambda}{|x_\lambda|} (1- |x_\lambda|^2 + \epsilon)^{1/2}, x_\mu \frac{(|x_\lambda|^2-\epsilon)^{1/2} }{(1-|x_\lambda|^2)^{1/2}})$. Which is not as mysterious as it might appear because it is just the composition of the obvious diffeomorphism $\psi: \mathbb{D}^n - S^{\lambda -1} \rightarrow (\mathbb{D}^{\lambda}-S^{\lambda-1}) \times \mathbb{D}^{\mu}$ followed by an involution in the $\lambda$ coordinate followed by the inverse of $\psi$. Now to attach a $\lambda$ handle to a manifold $N$, we choose an imbedding $h: T(\epsilon), \partial T(\epsilon) \rightarrow N, \partial N$ and then identify $x \in T(\epsilon)-S^{\lambda-1}$ with $h\beta (x)$. And finally, the quotient of $N-h(S^{\lambda -1}) \sqcup \mathbb{D}^n - S^{\lambda -1}$ under this identification is the desired handle attachment. Phew! Ok here's my question: What is the vector bundle structure $\phi: E' \oplus \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0} \rightarrow T(\epsilon)$ which makes the second definition equivalent to the first?  More to the point, why should one exist at all? I have been thinking about this for a long time and I have no idea what it should be. I think I know what $\phi |_{E'}$ should be but I have no idea how to extend it in such a way that the involutions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will ""line up."" Thank you for reading such an appallingly technical question. More thoughts:  What really stumps me is the following.  If the two involutions are to ""line up,""  each ray emanating from the origin in (a fiber of) $E$ should be mapped to a set of the form $\psi^{-1} \{(t x_{\lambda},x_\mu ) : \epsilon < t^2 < 1 \}$ for fixed $x_\lambda \in S^{\lambda -1}$ and $x_\mu \in \mathbb{D}^{\mu}$ and where $\psi$ is define as above. But these latter sets seem to be elliptical arcs whose closures will not be transversal to the boundary ($S^{n-1}$).  Whereas most rays emanating from the origin in (fibers of) $E$ $do$ meet the boundary transversely!... :(","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

340182,Strong Induction: Prove provided recurrence relation $a_n$ is odd.,"I'm not sure if we're allowed to post pictures but I thought it would be easier to read and I didn't see anything in the rules about it.  It's question 1.  Section 5.4 This question: Suppose $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ is a sequence defined as follows: $$
a_{1}=1, a_{2}=3
$$ $a_{k}=a_{k-2}+2 a_{k-1} \quad$ for all integers $k \geq 3$ Prove that $a_{n}$ is odd for all integers $n \geq 1$ Here is the answer: Proof (by strong mathematical induction): Let the property $P(n)$ be the sentence "" $a_{n}$ is odd."" Show that $P(1)$ and $P(2)$ are true: Observe that $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{2}=3$ and both 1 and 3 are odd. Thus $P(1)$ and $P(2)$ are true. Show that for any integer $k \geq 2,$ if $P(i)$ is true for all inte-
  gers i with $1 \leq i \leq k,$ then $P(k+1)$ is true: Let $k \geq 2$ be any integer, and suppose $a_{i}$ is odd for all integers $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$ . This is the inductive hypothe-
  sis. 1 We must show that $a_{k+1}$ is odd. We know that $a_{k+1}=$ $a_{k-1}+2 a_{k}$ by definition of $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots .$ Moreover, $k-1$ is less than $k+1$ and is greater than or equal to 1 (because $k \geq 2) .$ Thus, by inductive hypothesis, $a_{k-1}$ is odd. Also, every term of the sequence is an integer (being a sum of products of integers), and so $2 a_{k}$ is even by definition of even. Hence $a_{k+1}$ is the sum of an odd integer and an even integer and hence is odd (by exercise $19,$ in Section 4.1 ). This is what was to be shown. In the proof where it says ""Let $K\geq 2$ be any integer, and suppose...."" I don't see where or why they are using the value 2.

EDIT: Sorry, I didn't realise this notation wasn't common.  $A$ is a four-dimensional algebra over a field $F$, which we assume has characteristic $\neq 2$, spanned by $\{1,i,j,k\}$ thus:
$$
i^2=a\,1\quad j^2=b\,1\quad ij=-ji=k.
$$
where $a,b\in F^\ast$. However, I'd like to be able to accomplish this proof without using the algebraic closure, but I'm not sure what the most appropriate method is. Here's my proof: Take some nonzero $I\subset A$ and examine an arbitrary element $x_0+ix_1+jx_2+kx_3=x\in I\subset A$. Then we know
$$
(x_0+ix_1+jx_2+kx_3)(x_0-ix_1-jx_2-kx_3)=x_0^2-ax_1^2-bx_2^2+abx_3^2\in I
$$
since $I$ is closed under right (and left) multiplication. Now it would be great to suggest that this element is nonzero. If that were true, then we'd be done. If it's zero, then we have
$$
x_0^2+abx_3^2=ax_1^2+bx_2^2.

Because the cadinality of the domain of $A$ (which in this case is R) is GREATER than the cardinality of the co-domain which is ($\Bbb R-\{1\}$). Because this is so, there must be some duplicates such that two different elements in $A$ map to the same element in $B$. Does this make sense?
