4632279,Basis for infinite dimensional vector space definition,I'm reading Luenberger's Optimization by Vector Space Methods which has the following definition: A finite set $S$ of linearly independent vectors is said to be a basis for the space $X$ if $S$ generates $X$ . A vector space having a finite basis is said to be finite dimensional . All other vector spaces are said to be infinite dimensional . Am I going crazy for thinking that this definition does not really allow for infinite dimensional spaces since $S$ is defined as a finite set? Maybe there's some subtlety I'm missing here?,"['linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"
4632290,Is there a scenario for when changing the order of different quantifiers in a nested quantifier retain the original meaning?,"I was exploring the difference in meaning of a proposition when changing the order of two different quantifiers in a nested quantifier. I've been sitting here playing around with various scenarios and doing a bit of research, but I'm unable to come to a decisive answer. Does changing the order of different quantifiers always change the meaning of a logical proposition? There was two scenarios I was exploring: Not changing the order of Quantifiers but keeping the order of the variables (e.g. For all x there exists a y ,changed to, For all y there exists an x) Changing both the order of the quantifiers and the variables (e.g. For all x there exists a y ,changed to, There exists an x for all y) If anyone could give me a scenario or a reasoning as to why it's not possible, that would be amazing.

4632291,"If we have an open set $S$ and multiply every element of $S$ by a fixed complex number $z_{0}$, is the resultant set open?","Suppose S in a complex open set with elements $s \in \mathbb{C}$ , if we multiply all elements by a fixed complex number $z_0$ , will the resultant set be open as well? My intuition says yes, as multiplying a given open set geometrically has the effect of rotating and stretching the area defined by the set, so this new area should also be open. I am just not sure how I would go about proving it. Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: As some have pointed out the constraint on $z_0$ is that it is non-zero.",['complex-analysis']
4632299,Holomorphic maps into ruled surfaces,"Let $\Sigma$ be a compact Riemann surfaces. Let $L \to \Sigma$ be a holomorphic line bundle. This gives rise to a ruled surface $\mathbb{P}(\underline{\mathbb{C}} \oplus L) \to \Sigma$ , where $\mathbb{P}$ denotes the fiber-wise projectivization and $\underline{\mathbb{C}}:= \Sigma \times \mathbb{C} \to \Sigma$ is the trivial line bundle. Now, we can take any meromorphic section of $s$ of $L$ , which then gives rise to a holomorphic section $u$ of the ruled suface via the following construction:
As long as $z$ is no pole of $s$ , we define the section $u$ to be $$
u(z)=[1:s(z)]
$$ Note that this section is holomrophic if we take the chart of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ not containing the point $[0:1]$ . If $p$ is a pole, we have locally that $s$ contains no other pole or zero and we can write locally $$
s(z)=z^{-m}g(z)
$$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $g(z)$ zero- and polefree. Then we define $$
u(z)=z^{-m}[1:g(z)],
$$ which is holomorhpic, if we take the chart of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ not containing $[0:1]$ . So meromorphic sections of $L$ give rise to holomorphic sections of $\mathbb{P}(\underline{\mathbb{C}} \oplus L)$ . My question now is: Does every meromorphic section of this ruled surface arise in that way? I have the feeling, wether it does work or does not work, relies somehow on the compactness of $\Sigma$ . There is the know result on the complex plane (non-compact), for example, that every meromorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$ must not be rational (take $e^z$ ), however, on its compactification, it must be rational. Furthermore, my knowledge in algebraic geometry is a a bit lacking, so the question might even yield a trivial answer.","['complex-analysis', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

4632693,Seeking a practical layperson's explanation of the math behind spoke length selection for wheelbuilding,"I build bicycle wheels for a living. I am exceptionally frustrated with the quality and consistency of the calculation tools available for spoke lengths. For those of you who don’t build wheels, let me mention that the spoke length needs to be accurate within a millimeter, (less than 1/3 of one percent). Otherwise you run the risk of spokes which are too long (pops your tire) or too short (unsightly and creates a weak wheel). Compounding the task, manufacturing tolerances of rims, spokes, and hubs vary and they stretch and deform during building. With such a moving target, a tiny error in length calculation can become a time consuming failure. Here is the basic mathematical formula for spoke length determination: $$ l = \sqrt {a^2+r{_1}^2+r{_2}^2-2r_1r_2 cos(\alpha)}$$ Where: a = distance from the central point of the hub to the hub flange, for example 30 mm. This is the base of the triangle that defines the length of the spoke in a radial pattern or zero cross pattern. r1 = spoke hole circle radius of the hub. This is the radius of the circle defined by the center of the spoke holes in the hub flange. r2 = nipple seat radius, equal to half the ERD of the rim. (ERD is effective rim diameter. It is the circle defined by the point where the spoken nipple contacts the rim. It is effectively the endpoint of the spoke on the rim end.) m = number of spokes to be used for one side of the wheel, for example 36/2=18 (Wheels are typically built with 24, 28, 32, or 40 total spokes, with half that number being used for each side of the wheel) k = number of crossings per spoke (This number is difficult to explain, but will be either zero, one, two or three. 95% of my wheels are 3X, with the remainder being 2X.  It refers to the number of times in a given spoke crosses over or under other spokes in the wheel. More crossings equal a stronger wheel because there is more crossbracing between spokes. More in-depth explanation here ) α = 360° k/m For most bicycle wheel builders, this is an intimidating formula. I would like to see a practical demonstration of this formula in use. For a given hub and rim combination, how do I calculate spoke length using this formula? An example data set would be: A Rohloff Speedhub 500/14 is a fairly simple hub. It is a symmetrical
pattern hub. Both hub flanges have a circle diameter of 100mm $(r^1)$ . The
manufacturer specifies a two cross lacing $(k)$ on this hub. The center to flange distance on both sides of the hub is also
symmetrical, with a distance of 29mm $(a)$ from the center to each flange. This particular hub and rim are drilled for 36 spokes $(m)$ . An ERD of 594mm $(r^2)$ for a Sun Ringle MTX33 rim completes the necessary
data. As I recently built this wheel, I know that it requires a spoke length of 260mm. However, given only this information, this formula, and a pencil and paper, I would not be able to calculate the correct spoke length. Please help me understand how to solve this equation given this data set. In addition, I would like to know if it is possible, or rather how it is possible, to re-create this formula in an Excel spreadsheet or similar program. Any help is greatly appreciated.","['trigonometry', 'recreational-mathematics']"
4632714,Why is the volume of a cone not half the volume of the cylinder of which it is a part?,"Now I'm aware of the proof for the volume of a cone being a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder and the proof is satisfactory. Here's an alternate approach that seems to imply that the volume of the cone is actually half the volume of the cylinder. Now it clearly is a wrong result and hence my approach as a whole or some step  within it is wrong. I'm not able to spot the error here and would appreciate help. It is as follows, Imagine a cylinder with a radius r and a height h. Imagine the cylinder to be translucent. Now construct a cone inside the cylinder. Draw an altitude right through the middle of the cone, through the core of the entire structure (cone inside the cylinder). Imagine the structure right in front of your eyes. Consider a 2D vertical cross section of the shape right through the middle. The cone can be divided into two triangles on either side of the altitude with areas equal to (rh)/2. There are two inverted triangles on either side of the cone which would become the parts of the left-over cylinder should the cone be removed. Areas of these triangles are also (rh)/2. This parity of the two inner triangles(inside the cone) and two outer triangles (outside the cone) would be true throughout the cylinder. In other words, an infinite number of such pairs exists about the central altitude line. All such pairs, when added up, make up the solid cylinder. This implies that the volume of the cone and the volume of the left-over shape when the cone is removed are the same, that is, the cone is half the volume of the cylinder. What am I missing? I apologise for framing such a long and maybe, to some degree, an unintelligible question. I would have provided an animation had I the know-how.","['fake-proofs', 'geometry', 'volume']"

This is what I know. I know that $\{0\}$ nor $\mathbb{Z}^*$ can be open.

But each coefficient is the wedge of one of the sets $S$ as above. Conversely, if you have a subset $S$ corresponding to replacing $v_j$ by $v_{n + j}$ for some $j \in A \subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ then you can set $t_j = 0$ for $j \not\in A$ and pick $t_j$ very large for $j \in A$ . Since being linearly independent is an open condition, this will give linearly independent vectors $v_j + t_j v_{n+j}$ . $\square$","['linear-algebra', 'abelian-varieties']"

My Attempts Preliminary Analysis For every $\epsilon >0$ , we need to find a suitable $\delta$ such that: If $\Vert (x,y)-(3,1)\Vert _2 < \delta$ then $\left| \frac{x}{y} - 3\right| < \epsilon.$ First note that $$\left| \frac{x}{y} - 3\right| = \left| \frac{x}{y} - 3y + 3y -3\right| \le \left|\frac{1}{y}\right||x-3| + 3|y-1|.$$ It is obvious that $$|x-3| \le \Vert (x,y)-(3,1)\Vert_2\; \text{and} \; |y-1| \le \Vert (x,y)-(3,1)\Vert_2.$$ Suppose $\Vert (x,y)-(3,1)\Vert_2 < \frac{1}{2}$ then $|y-1| <\frac{1}{2}.$ As a result we have $$\frac{1}{2} < y < \frac{3}{2} \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{|y|} < 2.$$ Hence, $$\left| \frac{x}{y} - 3\right| \le \left|\frac{1}{y}\right||x-3| + 3|y-1|< 2\delta+3\delta = 5\delta.$$ Formal Proof For every $\epsilon > 0$ , we must
choose $$\delta= \min\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\epsilon}{5}\right\}.$$ If $\Vert (x,y)-(3,1)\Vert _2 < \delta$ then $\left| \frac{x}{y} - 3\right| < \epsilon.$ Is my proof correct?","['multivariable-calculus', 'solution-verification', 'epsilon-delta']"
4633388,Evaluating $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(1+x^{8}\right)}{x^{2}\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{2}}dx$,"(Motivation) Here is an integral I made up for fun: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(1+x^{8}\right)}{x^{2}\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{2}}dx.$$ WolframAlpha doesn't seem to come up with a closed form , but I believe it is $$2\pi\left(1+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}\right)-3\pi\left(\ln\left(\sqrt{2}\right)+\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)\right).$$ (Question) Aside from my attempt below, how else could one solve this? Could there possibly a more elegant method than constructing a 4-keyhole contour? I will try to shorten my attempt as much as possible because it is quite lengthy. If someone wants to read all of it and find any little mistakes, then I would greatly appreciate it, as someone who is seeking to expand his complex analysis skills. (Attempt) Let $f(z) = \dfrac{\log(1+z^8)}{z^2(1+z^2)^2}$ . Its pole is $z=i$ with an order of $2$ . Notice $z=0$ is a removable singularity because we can redefine $f(z) = z^6 -2z^8 +3z^{10}-4z^{12}+O\left(z^{13}\right)$ to make it holomorphic at $z=0$ . The branch points of $f(z)$ are obtained by $$1+z^8=0 \implies z = \exp\left(\frac{i\pi}{8}(2n+1)\right)$$ where $n \in \left\{0, 1, \ldots, 7\right\}.$ Also, let $B_n = \exp\left(\dfrac{i\pi}{8}(2n+1)\right)$ . Additionally, $$\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)=\log\left(\prod_{n=0}^{7}\left(z-B_{n}\right)\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{7}\log\left(z-B_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{7}\left(\log\left|z-B_{n}\right|+i\operatorname{arg}\left(z-B_{n}\right)\right).$$ Let $A_n(z) = \operatorname{arg}\left(z-B_{n}\right)$ . For $n \in \left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$ , let $A_n(z) \in \left(\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right),\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)+2\pi\right)$ . For $n \in \left\{4,5,6,7\right\}$ , let $A_n(z) \in \left(\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)-2\pi,\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)\right)$ . For convenience, I created this graphic of what the contour looks like. It can also be viewed here . By Cauchy's Residue Theorem, we have $$2\pi i\operatorname{Res}(f(z),z=i) = \left(\int_{-R}^{R}+\sum_{k=1}^{8}\int_{\lambda_k}+\sum_{m=0}^{3}\int_{\gamma_m}+\int_{\Gamma}\right)f\left(z\right)dz.$$ Perhaps I will write an addendum explaining how to show the integrals over $\Gamma$ and $\gamma_m$ , for each $m$ listed in the sum, go to $0$ . This is how to calculate the residue: $$2\pi i\operatorname{Res}\left(\dfrac{\log(1+z^8)}{z^2(1+z^2)^2},z=i\right) = 2\pi i\cdot\frac{1}{\left(2-1\right)!}\lim_{z \to i}\frac{d^{2-1}}{dz^{2-1}}\frac{\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)\left(z-i\right)^{2}}{z^{2}\left(z+i\right)^{2}\left(z-i\right)^{2}} = 2\pi-\frac{3\pi}{2}\ln\left(2\right)$$ after some basic calculus grunt work. This is how to calculate the $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ integrals: $$
\begin{align}
& \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\lim_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \to \Lambda_0}\lim_{R\to\infty}\left(\int_{\lambda_1}f(z-i\epsilon)d(z-i\epsilon) + \int_{\lambda_2}f(z+i\epsilon)d(z+i\epsilon)\right) \\
=&-\lim_{R\to\infty}\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{Re^{i\pi/8}}\frac{d(z-i\epsilon)}{(z-i\epsilon)^2(1+(z-i\epsilon)^2)^2}\cdot \left(\log|1+(z-i\epsilon)^8|+i\sum_{n=0}^{7}A_n(z-i\epsilon)\right) \\
&+\lim_{R\to\infty}\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{Re^{i\pi/8}}\frac{d(z+i\epsilon)}{(z+i\epsilon)^2(1+(z+i\epsilon)^2)^2}\cdot \left(\log|1+(z+i\epsilon)^8|+i\sum_{n=0}^{7}A_n(z+i\epsilon)\right) \\
=& -2\pi i\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{i\infty}\frac{dz}{z^{2}\left(1+z^{2}\right)^{2}} \tag{1}\\
\end{align}
$$ where in $(1)$ we used $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}A_0(z-i\epsilon) = \dfrac{\pi}{8}+2\pi$ and $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}A_0(z+i\epsilon) = \dfrac{\pi}{8}.$ Since $$\int \frac{dz}{z^2(1+z^2)^2} = -\frac{3}{2}\arctan\left(z\right)-\frac{3z^{2}+2}{2z^{3}+2z}+C,$$ we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to get the desired integral over $\Lambda_0$ to be $$-2\pi i\left(e^{-\frac{i\pi}{8}}+\frac{1}{4}\sec\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)-\frac{3}{2}\arctan\left(e^{-\frac{i\pi}{8}}\right)\right).$$ We can apply this same sort of process for the other $\lambda$ integrals. After a lot of work, combining those contributions ultimately yields $$3\pi\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)-2\pi\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}.$$ Finally, we put everything together: $$2\pi-\frac{3\pi}{2}\ln\left(2\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)}{z^{2}\left(1+z^{2}\right)^{2}}dz+3\pi\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)-2\pi\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}+0+0+0+0+0.$$ In conclusion, the integral in question equals $$2\pi\left(1+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}\right)-3\pi\left(\ln\left(\sqrt{2}\right)+\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)\right).$$ Any answer/comment shedding some light is appreciated.","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'calculus', 'contour-integration']"

4633569,Upper Bounding the Discrete Entropy by the Expectation,"Let $\mathcal P$ be the set of probability mass functions (pmfs) on $\mathbb Z_{>0}$ , i.e. for $p=(p(x))_{x\in\mathbb Z_{>0}}\in\mathcal P$ we have $p\ge 0$ and $\sum_{x=1}^\infty p(x)=1$ .
Let $H(p)=-\sum_{x=1}^\infty p(x)\ln(p(x))$ be the entropy and $E(p)=\sum_{x=1}^\infty p(x)x$ the expectation. Further, let $s(p)=|\{x\in\mathbb Z_{>0}:p(x)>0\}|$ be the size of the support of $p$ . For $s\in\mathbb Z_{>0}$ let $\mathcal P_s=\{p\in\mathcal P:s(p)=s\}$ , and further let $\mathcal P_\infty=\{p\in\mathcal P:s(p)=\infty,E(p)<\infty\}$ . Question : What are the best bounds for $r(s)=\sup_{p\in\mathcal P_s}H(p)/E(p)$ ? Motivation : I want good upper bounds for the entropy in terms of the support size and the expectation. Background :
The question only makes sense if we consider strictly positive random variables, otherwise $r(s)$ would be infinite, which can be seen by taking limits towards the one-point mass on $0$ . For this question we can assume that $p$ is supported on $\{1,\dots,s\}$ , respectively $\mathbb Z_{>0}$ for $s=\infty$ , and non-increasing, since ordering the weights minimizes the expectation while preserving the entropy. For $s<\infty$ we have $r(s)\le\ln(s)$ because $H(p)\le\ln(s)$ is maximal for the uniform distribution and $E(p)\ge 1$ . Of course, with the uniform distribution we also get a lower bound, namely $r(s)\ge 2\ln(s)/(s+1)$ , which is not tight because the entropy is stationary at the uniform distribution while the expectation is not. Also, we know that the supremum is attained due to continuity. Of course, identifying the maximizers would be highly desirable. For $s=\infty$ it is known that $H(p)=E(p)=\infty$ is possible, as discussed here .
As can be seen here , there are also quite a few follow-up questions. Unfortunately, I am not convinced by the given answer, and am still not aware of an answer to the question if $H(p)<\infty$ for all $p\in\mathcal P_\infty$ .
Should this be true, we may of course still have $r(\infty)=\infty$ , and in any case explicit maximizing sequences would be highly desirable. Finally, a similar question regarding a lower bound can be found here . Update :
A limiting argument directly yields that $r(s+1)\ge r(s)$ .
As discussed here , we have $H(p)\le\ln(E(p)+0.5)+1$ given by Theorem 8 in this preprint.
The map $f(x)=(\ln(x+0.5)+1)/x$ is decreasing on $[1,\infty)$ , with $f(x)=1$ for $x\approx 1.858$ .
Since we can assume that $p$ is non-increasing, we have $E(p)\le\frac{1+s}{2}$ . We clearly have $r(1)=0$ and a discussion of $f(p_1)=\frac{H(p_1)}{p_1+2(1-p_1)}$ gives the maximizer $p_1=\frac{1}{2}(\sqrt 5-1)\approx 0.618$ , the expectation $E(p)\approx 1.382$ and $r(2)\approx 0.481$ .
For $s=3$ we fix $\mu\in(1,2]$ and consider $p_1\ge p_2\ge p_3\ge 0$ with $p_1+p_2+p_3=1$ and $E(p)=\mu$ . Set $p_3=x$ and observe that $p_1=2-\mu+x$ , $p_2=\mu-1-2x$ , and that $\max(0,\frac{2}{3}\mu-1)\le x\le\frac{1}{3}(\mu-1)$ . The derivative $\ln(\frac{p_2^2}{p_1p_3})$ of the entropy on this restriction is decreasing with exactly one root $x=\frac{1}{2}\mu-\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{4-3(2-\mu)^2}$ . Numerical evaluation gives \begin{align*}
p_1&\approx 0.544\\
p_2&\approx 0.296\\
p_3&\approx 0.161\\
E(p)&\approx 1.617\\
r(3)&\approx 0.609.

Looking for simple systems I found in Wikipedia that a mass sliding in a horizontal plane under Coulomb friction is modeled by the differential equation of the Newton's 2nd law as: $$  m\ x'' = -F - \mu\ m\ g\ \text{sgn}(x')$$ where the mass $m$ , the earth's gravity acceleration $g$ , and the kinetic coefficient of friction $\mu$ are positive constants. I found here: brick sliding in an horizontal plane after an initial push that the mass sliding after an initial push indeed slides until it stops moving, being their behavior described through a piecewise polynomial closed-form solution, representing the scenario where the force $F = 0$ . As example is pretty obvious, which is good since can be easily found the procedure is right since results matches the classic answers found through energy analysis of the system. Now, to move into the next step of difficulty, I want to model the exact example of the Wikipedia page, the case where the mass is attached to a spring, where the only additional force present besides the Coulomb damping. So modeling the spring as the classical force $F = k x$ with $k$ the string constant ( $k>0$ ), the previous equation becomes: $$  m\ x'' = -k\ x - \mu\ m\ g\ \text{sgn}(x')$$ The question I have tried unsuccessful to solve the equation as I did for the case $F=0$ , and so far I don't find any papers with closed-form solutions to the equation: $$  x'' = -\frac{k}{m}\ x - \mu\ g\ \text{sgn}(x')$$ If I made every constant equal to one, then Wolfram-Alpha shows the following: As expected for a non-linear equation there are multiple solutions. I am specially interested in the solutions were the mass stop moving (which is impossible to represent accurately through a linear ODE or non-piecewise power series, as explained here - otherwise it will violate the Identity Theorem ), but differently from the mentioned example where I used a self-named endiness constraint : there exists a time $T>0$ such as $x(t) = 0,\ \forall t>T$ , but for what I have found on the papers, in this mass-spring system also exists the possibility that the mass stops moving in a different position than the original rest position, so it could have a final position $x_f$ constant, such as $x(t) = x_f,\ \forall t>T$ . I hope you could find the closed-form solution that stops moving , showing the equations that determines the finite extinction time $T$ and the final position $x_f$ , showing how you found them. Added later____________ Thinking in how the system could stop moving in a position different from equilibrium, I am expecting to find a solution of the form: $$f(t) = x(t)\theta(T-t)+x(T)\theta(t-T)$$ for some function $x(t)$ such as $f'(t)$ is a function finite duration (it achieve by self-dynamics the value zero ""continuously"" and stay there forever after), and with $\theta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function . Here I got messed with the integration constant by going backwards from $f'(t)$ to $f(t)$ since I don't know how you make appear the term $x(T)\theta(t-T)$ (this is the problem with these special functions that are hidden distributions - if you could explain this also, it would be great). This was finally answered here , but I still don't figure out how the solution will become a constant: for example think in the following numerical aproximation $x''+x+\text{sgn}(x')=0$ with arbitrary initial conditions $x(0)=-\frac{3\pi}{2}$ and $x'(0)=\frac{\pi}{2}$ shown numerically here : I don't have any clue of how the solution will satisfy the differential equation after it stops moving, neither how it will match the ""discrete-fix-value but variable term"" made by $\text{sgn}(x')$ . If you could explain it theoretically to have insight I will appreciate it, since I have intuition that the solution will be within the theory of distributions, at least in part (thinking in thing like $xf(x)=xg(x) \Rightarrow f(x)=g(x)+c\delta(x)$ ). Also, the solution should have some decaying term as is shown numerically for $x''+x+\text{sgn}(x')=0,\ \ x(0)=3\pi/2,\ \ x'(0)=10$ in here : This last point is important: as example, if I use the ansatz $x(t)=c_1\sin(t)+c_2\cos(t)-\text{sgn}\left(c_1\cos(t)-c_2\sin(t)\right)$ for the equation $x''+x+\text{sgn}(x')=0$ and I ignore every distribution-alike term like $\delta(f(t))\equiv 0$ I can see in Wolfram-Alpha that for every value of $t$ the differential equation is fulfilled, but as you could see from the solution the decaying term is missing, so it is not the solution for the problem - here maybe the distribution theory have something to say. What I did: $$\begin{array}{r l}
x''+x+\text{sgn}(x') = 0 & \Biggr| \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \\
\Rightarrow x'''+x'+2 x''\delta(x') =0 & \Biggr| \cdot x'\\
\Rightarrow x'x'''+(x')^2+\require{cancel}\cancel{2x''\cdot\underbrace{x'\delta(x')}_{\text{since }x\delta(x)\ =\ 0}} = 0 & \Biggr| y=x'\\
\Rightarrow y(y''+y)=0 & \Biggr| y\neq 0\ \forall t\\
\Rightarrow y(t) = c_3\sin(t)+c_4\cos(t) & \Biggr| \int \, dt \\
\Rightarrow x(t) = c_1\sin(t)+c_2\cos(t) + c &
\end{array}$$ but for inspection one could notice that the integration constant $c$ cannot really be constant since when using the solution in the equation $x''+x+\text{sgn}(x')=0$ I need something to ""kill"" the term $\text{sgn}(\cdot)$ , so the ""constant"" must not be constant, which it is also weird. And also the decaying term is still missing. My guess is that the decaying term should be a piece-wise polynomial of the form $(T-t)^q\theta(T-t)$ such as every derivative which rise delta function got canceled by $x^n\delta(x) = 0$ , similar to what happened in brick sliding in an horizontal plane after an initial push , but here since the velocity profile becomes zero, but the solution becomes a constant that can be different from zero, it is not easy to figure out how the answer will become a constant value - I hope that maybe this could help someone else to make a/the closed-form solution. I have checked in online Octave if the decaying behavior were just a mistake of Wolfram-Alpha (since the answer founded looks it solves at least the procedure I use to find it), but it looks is right, both could happen: (i) a decaying behavior, and (ii) and ending position different from equilibrium - both behaviors unattainable by a simple harmonic oscillator . f = @(t,y) [y(2);-sign(y(2))-y(1)];

\Rightarrow y' & = & x'-\delta(x')x'' \\
\Rightarrow y'' & = & x'' -\delta'(x')(x'')^2-\delta(x')x'''
\end{array}$$ Now, since $$\delta(f(x)) = \sum\limits_{n}|f'(x_n)|^{-1}\delta(x-x_n)\text{ with }f(x_n)=0,\,f'(x_n)\neq 0 $$ I will work from now on assuming that every term $\delta(\cdot)\equiv 0$ since they will affect only a zero-measure points, this hoping to find the solution outside this problematic points and later figure out how to solve in this places: So with this, the previous analysis becomes: $$\begin{array}{r c l}
\text{let }y & = & x-\text{sgn}(x') \\
\Rightarrow y' & = & x' \\
\Rightarrow y'' & = & x''
\end{array}$$ So now I have $y''+y+\text{sgn}(y') = 0 \iff x''+ x -\text{sgn}(x')+\text{sgn}(x')=0 \iff x''+x = 0$ But now I don't know how to solve $x''+x=0$ without a only-trigonometric solution. I tried unsuccessfully something of the form: $$ x = (T-t)\theta(T-t)(c_1\sin(t)+c_2\cos(t)) $$ which at least cancel every polynomial term letting only trigonometric functions to be cancelled. If I plot the following solution in online Octave : f = @(t,y) [y(2);-sign(y(2))-y(1)];

plot(ts,ys(:,1),'b'); Is not hard to see that the decay is indeed linear, so I don't believe I am too lost about the solution. Hope you could share some ideas. Finally I have tested the linear decay and it isn't purely lineal (more clear at the end), as can be seen contrasted in the following graph: 3rd attempt________________ Following the change of variables that @eyeballfrog have used in their answer, lets think in the differential equation as: $$z(\tau)''+\frac{k}{m}\ z(\tau)+\mu\ g\ \text{sgn}(z'(\tau))=0$$ Now let $\tau = w t$ with $w = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ , so $\frac{k}{m} = w^2$ and $z(\tau) = \frac{\mu g}{w^2}x(w\ \tau)$ .
Now I would like to know which happens in $ z(\tau)''+ w^2 z(\tau)+\mu\ g\ \text{sgn}(z'(\tau))=0$ . Then, I have that: $$\begin{array}{r c l}
z'(\tau) = \frac{\mu g}{w^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} x(w\tau) = \frac{\mu g}{w^2} x'(w\tau) w & = & \frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau) \\
\Rightarrow z''(\tau) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}\left( \frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau)\right) = \frac{\mu g}{w} x''(w \tau) w & = & \mu g\ x''(w\tau)\\
\end{array}$$ Replacing I will have now that: $$\begin{array}{c}
\mu g\ x''(w\tau)+ w^2 \frac{\mu g}{w^2}x(w\ \tau)+\mu\ g\ \text{sgn}(\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau))=0 \\
\iff \mu g \left(x''(w\tau) +x(w\tau)+\text{sgn}(\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau))\right) = 0 \\
\end{array}$$ Now using that $\mu g \neq 0$ and also that $\frac{\mu g}{w}>0$ such its true that $$\text{sgn}(\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau))  = \frac{\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau)}{|\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau)|} = \frac{\frac{\mu g}{w}x'(w\tau)}{|\frac{\mu g}{w} | \cdot|x'(w\tau)|} = \text{sgn}(x'(w\tau))$$ then I will have I only need to find the solutions to: $$x''(t) +x(t)+\text{sgn}(x'(t)) = 0$$ Which is why I am working in this equation now: the solution will work only if $\mu>0$ and $g>0$ and $k>0$ and $m>0$ , keep this in mind. Now, I have found to make appear a decaying behavior in the solution but I don't think is a $100\%$ rigorous: $$\begin{array}{r l}
x''+x+\text{sgn}(x') = 0 & \Biggr| \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \\
\Rightarrow x'''+x'+2 x''\delta(x') =0 & \Biggr| \cdot \delta(x')\\
\Rightarrow \delta (x')\left(x'''+ x' \right) + 2x''(\delta(x'))^2= 0 & \Biggr| \text{assuming arbitrarily that }(\delta(x))^2\equiv\delta(x)\\
\Rightarrow ?\quad \delta (x')\left(x'''+ x' + 2x''\right) = 0 & \Biggr| y = x' \\
\Rightarrow y''+y+2y'=0 & \\
\Rightarrow y(t) = c_3\exp(-t)+c_4\ t \exp(-t) & \Biggr| \int \, dt \\
\Rightarrow x(t) = c_1\exp(-t)+c_2\ t \exp(-t) + c &
\end{array}$$ Which is interesting since indeed got a polynomial term, also jointly with an exponential, but in a way that the derivative keep the same structure except for a constant: this thinking in that the speed profile needs to end at zero at time $T$ , but the position needs to become a constant, kind of fit with this result. Since the decay looks quite linear, I tried for the exponential term something of form $\frac{e^{T}}{e^{T}-1}\left(1-e^{T-t}\right)$ in order it affects little at the beginning, but that ends at zero so it keeps the same decay as the polynomial term, again of the form $(T-t)$ so it have a zero at time $T$ , and since the trigonometric function is already tested as solving the solution, I incorporated for now arbitrarily as a linear addition that will be predominant at the end of the movement (should be the same function as the one attached to the decay, at least in principle, in order to keep the number of integration constants that could be determined by the initial conditions): Which looks quite promising for being just a not-fitted mix of the solutions I have being found (not rigorously), so I think maybe the answer have the form: $$x(t) = M\theta(T-t)(t-T)(1-e^{-(T-t)})\left(a\sin(t)+b\cos(t)\right)+N\left(a\sin(t)+b\cos(t)\right)+C$$ or like $$x(t) = M\theta(T-t)|(t-T)(1-e^{-(T-t)})|\left(a\sin(t)+b\cos(t)\right)+N\left(a\sin(t)+b\cos(t)\right)+C$$ with some constants $M,\ N,\ T,\ a,\ b,\ C$ to be determined by initial conditions, but I have no clue if the $\text{sgn}(x')$ should be added, while looking good in theory, it will introduce unobserved ""jumps"" on the solution. Best numerical attempt so far_________ I uploaded because is quite good , even when I just search by hand some values for the constants, without making any ""goodness-of-fit"" approach for estimating them: f = @(t,y) [y(2);-sign(y(2))-y(1)];

I know that there are a lot of open problems around periods, besides the famous conjecture itself it is not known whether e.g. $e$ is a period or not, whether $\frac{1}{\pi}$ is a period or not etc. What I could not find is an example of a real number that is known not to be a period and might it just be by some obscure construction as in the case of say normal numbers. I usually rather work with $p$ -adic integrals, so I also don't know how such an construction would look like, so my question is summarized as: Do we know a specific computable real number, that is provably not a period and if so, how do we construct it?","['number-theory', 'transcendence-theory', 'real-algebraic-geometry', 'transcendental-numbers']"
4634130,Proving the equivalence of two inequalities,"Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function that admits primitives on $\mathbb{R}$ and $F:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ one primitive (i.e. $F'(x)=f(x), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ ). Prove that the following two inequalities are equivalent: \begin{align}
a)&& (f(x)-f(y))(x-y) &\ge (x-y)^2, && \forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}
\\b)&& F(x)-F(y) &\ge \frac{1}{2}(x-y)^2+f(y)(x-y), &&\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}

But I have not found a way to prove the converse statement. My first thought was to use the mean value theorem to get $F$ into the equation, but the mean value theorem implies the existence of a point, which would not satisfy the $\forall$ quantifier.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'indefinite-integrals', 'derivatives']"

E\left[\max_{0\leq k \leq n}|X_k| \right]\leq \frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1} E[|X_n|^{\alpha}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}.
$$ Hint: $$
E\left[\max_{0\leq k \leq n}|X_k| \right]=\int _{0}^{\infty} P \left [\max_{0\leq k \leq n}|X_k|>t \right ] dt.
$$ Now use the maximal inequality on the submartingale $|X_n|^{\alpha}$ (Let ${X_n}$ be a submartingale for which $X_n\geq 0$ for all n. Then for any positive $\lambda>0$ we have $\lambda P[\max_{0\leq k\leq n} X_k>\lambda] \leq E[X_n]$ ). and its answer Hints: apply submartingale inequality to $\{Y_j:1\leq j \leq n\}$ where $Y_j=\frac {|X_j|^{\alpha}} {E(|X_n|^{\alpha})^{\frac 1 {\alpha}}}$ . [By Jensen's inequality this is indeed a submartingale]. Note that $$

We have been given that $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0}  \frac{1-\sqrt{\cos2x}.\sqrt[3]{\cos3x}.\sqrt[4]{\cos4x}...\sqrt[n]{\cos{nx}}}{x^2}$ = 10   and we are required to find n . This is the $\frac{0}{0}$ form, so we can use L'Hôpital's rule . After taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator separately, the problem becomes- $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0}  \frac{-\frac{d}{dx}\sqrt{\cos2x}.\sqrt[3]{\cos3x}.\sqrt[4]{\cos4x}...\sqrt[n]{\cos{nx}}}{2x}$ = 10 $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0}  \frac{-\frac{d}{dx}\prod_{i = 2}^{n} (\cos ix)^\frac{1}{i}}{2x}$ = 10 Now, the numerator looks like a pretty difficult expression to differentiate. Here, I decided to simplify the expression in the numerator first. Let y= $\prod_{i = 2}^{n} (\cos ix)^\frac{1}{i}$ Now, we can simplify the expression by taking the natural logarithm of both sides. $\log(y)$ = $\log(\prod_{i = 2}^{n} (\cos ix)^\frac{1}{i})$ Now we can use the property of logarithms to simplify the expression, $\log(xy)=\log(x)+\log(y)$ $\log(y)$ = $\sum_{i = 2}^{n} \frac{1}{i}.\log(\cos ix)$ This is where I ran out of ideas to simplify this expression any further.

4634188,Clifford's Theorem for algebraic groups,"This is Exercise 4.2 in Milne's 'Algebraic Groups': Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $k$ and $H$ a normal algebraic subgroup of $G$ . From a representation $(V,r)$ of $H$ and a $g\in G(k)$ , we get a conjugate representation $h \mapsto r(ghg^{-1})$ of $H$ . Assume that $G(k)$ is schematically dense in $G$ , and let $(V,r)$ be a simple representation of $G$ . Show that $(V, r|_H)$ is semisimple and that all of its simple constituents are conjugate and have the same multiplicity. This is basically a generalization of Clifford's theorem to algebraic groups. The original version says that a simple representation of an abstract group splits as a direct sum of conjugate simple representations after restriction to a normal subgroup. In particular, for any $k-$ algebra $R$ it shows the representation $(V\otimes R,r)$ of $G(R)$ splits as a direct sum of conjugate representations of $H(R)$ , i.e. representations of the form $W_R^{g_i}$ conjugate to some representation $W_R$ , where $W_R^{g_i}$ have the same underlying space as $W_R$ and $h\in H(R)$ acts on $W_R^{g_i}$ as $g_ihg_i^{-1}$ acts on $W_R$ with $g_i\in G(R)$ . In particular, this is true for $R=k$ . The only thing that remains is to show that these $g_i$ can be chosen in a consistent way for all $R$ , i.e. as base changes of some $g_i\in G(k).$ This is where the schematic density should come into play, but I can't seem to understand how exactly. I apologise for the messy notation, I still am not quite sure whether spelling everything out explicitly makes the writing more clear or more overburdened with notation when working with algebraic groups as group schemes.","['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-groups']"

I think this is quite easy to see. For the second line it's in my opinion quite easy to see that the second number ( $b_{22}$ ) is always the old second number ( $a_{22}$ ) times 2 and because the first number with wich we started ( $a_{22}$ ) is the number 2 it's just always powers of 2. And the first number ( $b_{21}$ ) is always the old first number ( $a_{21}$ ) plus the old second number ( $a_{22}$ ). And because the first number with wich we started ( $a_{21}$ ) is on less than the second number with wich we started ( $a_{22}$ ) it's always one less than the power of 2.

We can place the tiles anywhere on the board, provided that they never cover the same area more than once. The tile orientation (horizontal or vertical) does not matter. The question asked is can we put some number of these tiles on the board so that there exists a $(kn+1)\times(kn+1)$ region which is fully covered by the tiles? After a few attempts I suppose the answer is negative. I have tried various tricks with coloring the grid, but with no success. I think it's crucial that we can never fit $k + 1$ tiles oriented horizontally in the same row (an analogous observation is true for columns), so maybe there is a clever way of coloring based on that. The question originally asked for the case $k=3, n=5$ under the assumption the $(kn+1)\times(kn+1)$ region must not share any border with the whole grid. However, as was suggested in the comments, this assumption is not necessary.","['contest-math', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics', 'game-theory', 'tiling']"

4634735,"Proof that axiom of replacement won't generate a set going arbitrarily high in the cumulative hierarchy, without relying on replacement?","Is it possible to prove, in first-order ZFC, that the axiom of replacement can't generate a set that includes members going arbitrarily high in the cumulative hierarchy, but without using the axiom of replacement itself for the proof?  Or in other words, to prove without using replacement that the kind of mapping used by replacement won't include elements in its output image going arbitrarily high in the hierarchy? If it's helpful, part of the motivation for this question is the issue raised here [1] arguing that the replacement axiom doesn't follow directly from the iterative conception of sets: ""When Replacement has been justified according to the iterative conception, the reasoning has in fact been circular as it was in Zermelo [1930a], with some feature of the cumulative hierarchy picture newly adduced solely for this purpose.""  In particular, one concern you might have with the axiom of replacement, from the standpoint of the iterative conception of sets, is that the mapping in replacement might map to sets arbitrarily high in the hierarchy, so there might be no valid set formed by the image of the mapping (just a class).  Now, if you have full ZFC including replacement, then you can show that the mappings used by replacement can never map arbitrarily high in the hierarchy, but what I'm unclear on is whether this can be shown without relying on the axiom of replacement for any part of the proof (since in the context of the linked paper the goal would be to intuitively justify replacement from the iterative conception, and avoid circularity in this justification). Here is a related question, but for 2nd order ZFC [2]. Note, the answer to this previous question assumes that there is an inaccessible cardinal in the metatheory, but the current question should rely only on the ZFC axioms.

4634819,Historical proof of Bézout's theorem,"Bézout's theorem says that given $f, g$ homogeneous polynomials over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ with degrees $n, m$ respectively, the number of intersections of their zero sets is exactly $nm$ , counted with multiplicities. I know of two proofs that can be found in modern references. One uses the more classical machinery of resultants (in which intersection multiplicity is defined as the exponent of a particular term in a particular resultant), and the other uses the more modern machinery of local rings (in which intersection multiplicity is defined as the dimension of a particular vector space). Wikipedia alludes to a third, less rigorous proof that goes somewhat along these lines: The intersection multiplicity of $f$ and $g$ at $p$ can be computed by applying small perturbations to the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ , then counting the maximum possible number of intersections in a small neighborhood of $p$ . In doing so, we reduce the problem to counting intersections of generic polynomials, which is easy (but I don't see why it's easy). Apparently, this is Bézout's original proof, so I tried reading a translation of his original book General Theory of Algebraic Equations . But I have a difficult time parsing the older language.

Attempts thus far: I have started with the first two rows : $$\xi=\frac12\begin{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\\ 0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \star \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \star \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \star \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \star \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix}
\\  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0\\ 0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} \star \\ 0 \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} \star \\ 0 \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} \star \\ 0 \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} \star  \\ 0 \\ \star \\ \star\\ \star\end{pmatrix} \end{bmatrix}$$ To get orthogonality along the first row, we are multiplying four numbers, and along columns, just three. I started with 24th roots of unity but then this reduced to sixth roots, powers of $w=\exp(2\pi i/6)$ . You can get some of what you want with this by considering what combinations of four and three sixth roots give zero. It seems possible to get all but one of: orthogonal along rows one, two, three appropriate orthogonality between rows one and two, and one and three appropriate orthogonality between rows two and three But it seems to fail before it ever gets to rows four or five, or indeed the second condition of being non-orthogonal nor parallel, nor anti-parallel. This wasn't the best I did, but something like: $$\xi=\frac12\begin{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\\ 0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ -1\\ -1\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ w \\ w^4 \\ 1\\ -1\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1\\ -1 \\ w^2\\ w^5\end{pmatrix}
\\  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0\\ 0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} w \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ w^2\\ w^4\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} w \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ w^5\\ 1\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} w^2 \\ 0 \\ w^4 \\ w^2\\ w\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} w \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ w^4\\ -1\end{pmatrix}
\\  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0\\ 0\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ w \\ 0 \\ w^5\\ -1\end{pmatrix} & \begin{pmatrix} w^2 \\ w \\ 0 \\ w^2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} -1\\ w^2 \\ 0 \\ w^5\\ 1\end{pmatrix}  & \begin{pmatrix} w^2 \\ w \\ 0 \\ w\\ w^2\end{pmatrix}  \end{bmatrix}$$ This attempt falls down on orthogonality in row three, and orthogonality in row 2 vs row 3.","['inner-products', 'orthogonality', 'matrices', 'roots-of-unity', 'complex-numbers']"

4635155,"Is there such a thing as a ""noncommutative field""?","A field $F$ is a set that is essentially a commutative group in two ways: $(F,+)$ is a commutative group with an identity element we call $0$ . $(F\setminus\{0\},\times)$ is a commutative group with an identity element we call $1$ .

4635194,Extensions of Height-Preserving Isomorphisms in Ulm's Theorem,"I am working through the proof of Ulm's Theorem in Kaplansky's book ``Infinite Abelian Groups."" Ulm's theorem states that two countable reduced abelian $p$ -groups $G,H$ with the same Ulm invariants are isomorphic. Kaplansky's particular proof of Ulm's theorem is important because it is often used, word-for-word, to prove similar classification theorems for other kinds of structures. The key step in this proof is to extend a given height-preserving isomorphism to another height-preserving isomorphism. The part I'm confused about has nothing to do with the Ulm invariants or the fact that these groups are reduced, so please excuse me if I don't define these notions. However, central to the proof is the notion of height. We can define, inductively, $G_0 = G$ , $G_{\alpha + 1} = pG_{\alpha}$ , and $G_{\alpha}$ for limit $\alpha$ is defined in the obvious way by taking intersections. For $x \in G$ , we define the height of $x$ , denoted $h(x)$ , to be $\infty$ if $x=0$ and $\alpha$ if $x \in G_{\alpha}$ but not $G_{\alpha + 1}$ . It can be easily shown that if $h(x) \neq h(y)$ then $h(x+y) =$ min $(h(x),h(y))$ and  if $h(x) = h(y)$ then $h(x+y) \geq h(x)$ . The proof proceeds in stages. At stage $n$ , we start with a height-preserving isomorphism $V:S \rightarrow T$ between finite subgroups $S,T$ of $G,H$ respectively. We then take an arbitrary element $x$ of $G$ and extend $V$ to include $x$ in its domain. We are allowed to assume that i) $x \not \in S$ but $px \in S$ , ii) $x$ is proper with respect to $S$ , meaning that $h(x) \geq h(x+s)$ for all $s \in S$ , and iii) $h(px) \geq h(p(x+s))$ for all $s \in S$ . We then find an element $w \in H$ such that $w \not \in T$ , $pw = V(px)$ , $h(w) = h(x)$ , and $w$ is proper with respect to $T$ . Extending $V$ in the obvious way we get a map $V': \langle S,x \rangle \rightarrow \langle T,w \rangle$ , which should still be an isomorphism and height-preserving. My question is: Why is $V'$ height-preserving? Note that all heights are supposed to be calculated with respect to the larger groups $G,H$ . Now, an arbitrary element of $\langle S,x \rangle$ is of the form $s \pm nx$ . Since for any $x$ , $h(x) = h(-x)$ , it suffices to show that $V'$ preserves the height of an element of the form $s+nx$ . Moreover since $px \in S$ we may assume $n < p$ . That is, we want to show that $$ h(nx+s) = h(nw + V(s)).$$ So far, I have only been able to show that $h(x+s) = h(w+V(s))$ , which follows since $h(x+s) =$ min $(h(x), h(s))$ by the fact that $x$ is proper with respect to $S$ . There is also a proof of Ulm's theorem in Fuchs' ``Infinite Abelian Groups"", which seems to claim that this fact is enough to conclude that $V'$ is height-preserving. I don't understand this at all; there doesn't seem to be any clear connection between $h(nx+s)$ and $h(x+s)$ .  Even ignoring this advice, I am pretty stuck since height does not seem to be well-behaved with respect to addition.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

4635315,Stochastic model of a RL circuit,"I would like to solve stochastic electric circuits numerically. I already know that I should use Milstein method to solve those systems. However, I'm not sure if the stochastic differential equations are correct, if the modeling is correct. Thus, could you give me a feedback whether or not my reasoning is correct? Consider a series RL circuit . Mathematically, it can be modeled as: \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\dot{I}(t) = \frac{V_L(t)}{L} \\
\dot{V_L}(t) = \dot{V}(t) - R \dot{I}(t)
\end{cases}
\end{equation} As previously stated, I want it to be a stochastic electric circuit. Thus, all parameters should be random variables. For example, I want them to satisfy: \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
L = L_0 + e^{B_t} \\
R = R_0 + e^{B_t} \\
V(t) = V_0 \sin(120 \pi t) + \sigma B_t
\end{cases}
\end{equation} where $B_t$ stands for brownian motion and the other constants are all real positive ones. With that in mind, Rewrite both equations in differential form: \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
dI = \frac{V_L(t)}{L}dt \\
dV_L = dV - R dI
\end{cases}
\end{equation} Substitute the parameters: \begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
dI = \frac{V_L(t)}{L_0 + e^{B_t}}dt \\
dV_L = 120 \pi V_0 \cos( 120 \pi t) dt + \sigma dB_t - \underbrace{(R_0 + e^{B_t}) dI}_{?}
\end{cases}
\end{equation} The part ""?"" feels weird to me. Because I'm used to solve such kind of systems numerically: \begin{equation}
d \vec{X} = \vec{F}(t, \vec{X}) dt + \vec{G}(t, \vec{X}) d\vec{W}
\end{equation} Surely, I could use substitution. Thus I would arrive at the last kind of equation for one dimension. But I would like to solve systems of SDEs numerically. Is this reasoning correct? Personally, I do think it is. But this field is quite new to me and sometimes tricky. Thanks P.S.: I have just read this book on stochastic calculus . I'm an electrical engineering student. EDIT The original problem is: I would like to solve stochastic electrical circuits numerically. That means I have the following things to do: model the electrical circuit using stochastic differential equations. Which I'm yet not sure if the reasoning is correct; find the equations that can entirely describe the dynamics of the circuit; set up the following equation: \begin{equation}
d \vec{X} = \vec{F}(t, \vec{X}) dt + \vec{G}(t, \vec{X}) d\vec{W}
\end{equation} use Milstein's method to solve it numerically. An attempt to answer question 1 has been done right above. There I try to model a series RL circuit. The answers to question 2 and 3 depends whether or not my attempt to answer question 1 is correct or not. That's why this question focuses on the validity of the stochastic model and its reasoning. Finally, question 4 is already solved. I know how to implement Milstein's method numerically.","['mathematical-modeling', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"
