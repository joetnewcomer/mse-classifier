693943,Where does the power $2$ come from in the Pythagorean theorem?,"So $$a^2+ b ^2 =c^2$$ in a right triangle, but where does the power $2$ come from? I know we can use different metrics in the Euclidean space. If we use the $p$-metrics, where $p$ is in place of $2$, the case $p=2$ is the only one that makes $\mathbb{R}^n$ an inner product space (right?). So it's the only case where we can even talk about right triangles. But I guess my question is then that is there some sort of underlying (physical) reason for the exponent $2$?","['geometry', 'metric-spaces']"
693969,Distributive nearring,"A nearring is a ring-like structure $R$ such that $(R, +, 0)$ is a group (possibly non-abelian) $(R, \cdot)$ is a semigroup $(x+y)\,z=xz+yz$ (right-distributivity) In other words, three conditions that may fail differ it from an actual ring: Addition may be non-commutative There may be no multiplicative identity Left-distributivity may fail It's easy enough to give examples of nearrings for which arbitrary subsets of these 3 conditions nevertheless hold, except for (2)+(3) and pure (3). It is well-known that existence of identity and two-sided distributivity implies (1), so (2)+(3) without (1) is impossible. What about pure (3)? Question : are there fully distributive nearrings with non-abelian additive subgroups? Some thoughts: Such nearrings are necessarily pretty weird. Adapting the usual proof that (2)+(3) implies (1), we can argue that
$$
a\,((x+y)-(y+x))=0
$$
for all $x,y,z\in R$. This seems a pretty strong condition, even though lack of multiplicative identity does not allow us to conclude immediately $x+y=y+x$. Definition Let left-distributing element be $a\in R$ such that $a(x+y)=ax+ay$ for all $x, y\in R$ All nearrings are isomprhic to subsets of $M(G)$ - nearring of functions from group $G$ to itself with pointwise addition and composition as multiplication. Left-distributing elements are precisely endomorphisms. Still, set of endomorphisms does contain identity (likely minor obstacle), and for nonabelian $G$ is not a sub-nearring of $R$ (major problem). Product of left-distributing elements is left-distributing, but sum of left-distributing elements may fail to be, so the sub-nearring generated by endomorphisms in general most likely does not satisfy (3). Sub-nearring generated by endomorphisms mapping $G$ to $Z(G)$ would do the trick, but addition would be abelian.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
693971,"find a 4th order linear, non-homo ODE whose general solution:","How to find a fourth order, linear, not homogenous ODE with general solution: $y=c_1+c_2 x+c_3 e^{2x}\cos x+c_4e^{2x}\sin x-x e^{-x}$?

694017,Transition from parametric to nonparametric statistics: what is $\Theta$?,"During my first statistics course I learned that a statistical model is a collection of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$, where we can index each measure by a 'parameter' $\theta$ such that $\mathcal{P} = \{P_\theta\,\,|\,\,\theta\in\Theta\}$. My first question is: What exactly is $\Theta$? I am now working on a project concerning nonparametric statistics where $\Theta$ is always an (infinite dimensional) vector space. However, when we look at the parametric normal family $\{N(\mu,\sigma^2)\,\,|(\mu,\sigma)\in\Theta = \mathbb{R}\times(0,\infty)\}$, then clearly $\Theta$ is no vector space. A possible answer that I thought of was that $\Theta$ is in general a metric space (although maybe just a set is enough?), but then how do we mark the transistion between a parametric model and non parametric model. To only separate when $\Theta$ is an infinite dimensional vector space produces strange cases. For example: when we consider an infinite dimensional vector space, but interpret it as just a metric space, do we suddenly deal with a parametric model? That seems odd... My second question: What exactly separates parametric and nonparametric models when we look at $\Theta$. Thank you!",['statistics']

694183,Prove $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to the surface $f$,"I'm trying to prove that $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to the surface $f$. I think I have a valid proof but I'm not sure that it is rigorous. To prove $\nabla f$ is normal  I am proving that $\nabla f\cdot u=0$ for any vector $u$ tangent to the surface $f$. Say $z=f(x,y)$ then $\nabla f$ $= \left(\begin{array}{c}
\delta_x\\
\delta_y\end{array}\right)$ and choosing any vector $v=(v_1,v_2)$ we need to construct the tangent vector to the surface. The tangent vector is $(v_1,v_2,f'_u$( x )). We achieve $f'_u$( x ) from $\nabla f\cdot u$ which gives us $f'_u$( x )$= v_1\delta_x + v_2\delta_y$. Therefore the tangent vector is $u=(v_1,v_2,v_1\delta_x+v_2\delta_y)$. Now we can dot $\nabla f$ with $u$. However now I came across the problem that we had one vector with 3 rows and one with 2 rows. Therefore I redefined $\nabla f$ and called a new fucntion $g(x,y,z)=f(x,y)-z$ at the level set $g(x,y,z)=0$. Now $\nabla g$ has three components and $$\nabla g=(\delta_x,\delta_y,-1)$$ I then took the dot product of $\nabla g$ and $u$ and this gave $$v_1\delta_x+v_2\delta_y-(v_1\delta_x+v_2\delta_y)=0$$ Therefore $\nabla g$ is orthogonal to the level set $g(x,y,z)=0$ and by equivalence $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to the surface $f(x,y)$. Now that is I'm guessing that's a long way round but would you class it as rigorous? Any suggestions to improve it? Is there any way to not have to use $g(x,y,z)$?

694205,About limits and successions,"This is a problem which I am not sure I solved correctly, mainly because there are some passages which are not very rigourous. Let $\{x_n\} $ be an increasing succession such that $x_n > 0$ and the
  tangent at the point $x_n$ of the function $y = \cos x$ passes through
  the origin. Let $c_n$ be the coefficient of the tangent line at the
  point $x_n$, calculate $$\lim_{n\to \infty} x_n - n\pi$$ and $$\lim _{n \to \infty} nc_{2n}$$ My attempt Well the first thing I did was finding that it must be $\tan x_n = -\frac{1}{x_n}$ So it seems easy to see (from the graphics) from this that $x_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ This implies than $\lim_{n \to \infty} \tan x_n = 0 \Rightarrow x_n \sim n\pi$ But this is not enough to prove the first limit as it is an insufficient approximation. So I'm going to say that since $\tan {x_n} \sim x_n - n\pi$, then $$x_n = -\frac{1}{\tan x_n} \sim -\frac{1}{x_n - n\pi}$$ Basically I'm identifying $x_n$ with its second order approximation. from the last equation one easily find $$x_n = \frac{n\pi + \sqrt{n^2\pi^2 - 4}}{2}$$ So $$\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n - n\pi = -\frac{2}{n \pi} = 0$$ For the second one, $$c_{2n} = -\sin(x_{2n}) \sim \sin(-\frac{2}{n \pi}) \sim -\frac{2}{n \pi}$$
So $$\lim _{x \to \infty} nc_{2n} = n \cdot -\frac{2}{n \pi} = -\frac{2}{\pi}$$","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'geometry', 'limits']"

694235,Proof that the predictable sigma algebra is also generated by continuous and adapted processes,"I'm reading George Lowther's blog and have a question about the proof of lemma 2. We want to verify that the predictable sigma algebra is also generated by the continuous and adapted processes. One direction is clear, for the other the idea is to write a left continuous process $X$ as the limit of a ccontinuous process. For this purpose he defines $$Y_t^n:=n\int_{t-\frac{1}{n}}^t\mathbf1_{|X_{s\vee 0}|\le n}X_{s\vee 0} ds$$ I've proved the following statement (see this question ). For $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ Borel, bounded the map $t\mapsto \int_{t-h}^tf(s)ds$ is lipschitz continuous. Assuming additionally left continuity of $f$ we have $$\lim_{h\downarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{t-h}^tf(s)ds=f(t)\tag{1}$$ $(1)$ implies the continuity of $Y^n_t$ and the convergence of $Y_t^n\to X_t$. This leads to the following two question: George Lowther writes $Y^n\to X$, what does this mean? I wonder why left-continuity is important comparing with right continuity. We can write $$\lim_{h\downarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{t}^{t+h}f(s)ds=f(t)\tag{1'}$$ if we assume $f$ to be right continuous. Hence we would conclude that the optional sigma algebra, which is generated by the right continuous and adapted processes is also generated by the continuous and adapted processes implying that the optional and predictable sigma algebra coincide. Therefore, I made a mistake in the right continuous case, but I can't see where. It would be appreciated if someone could explain what goes wrong in the right continuous case.","['stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

694416,Understanding group presentation as a quotient,"I'm just starting to learn a little group theory, so please forgive any ignorance I demonstrate in the following. I'm trying to understand the concept of a group being defined based on its presentation $G = \langle S \mid R \rangle$ as the quotient group of the free group $F_S$ generated by $S$, and the normal subgroup $R^{F_S}$ generated by $R$ in $F_S$. I understand the basic idea that the normal subgroup $R^{F_S}$, is gathering up all the elements of $F_S$ that are to be defined as equivalent to $1_G$ (the identity in group $G$). I also understand that dividing $F_S$ by $R^{F_S}$ (is ""dividing"" the correct term?) partitions $F_S$ and that each of these partitions will essentially end up as a different element of $G$, and further, since $R^{F_S}$ is a normal subgroup, the partitions can be turned into a group by inheriting the group operation of $F_S$. But I'm having trouble wrapping my head around exactly how the relators set $R$ partitions $F_S$. Not mechanically, that part I understand in terms of finding the cosets $gR^{F_S}$, but in a more intuitive sense, how do we tell how these relators define the structure of the group $G$? Taking the dihedral group $D_4$, for instance, presenting it as $\langle r, v | r^4 = v^2 = rfrf = 1 \rangle$, how do we understand from this that $fR^{F_S}$, and $r^3R^{F_S}$, and $rfrR^{F_S}$, will all produce their ""own"" cosets, instead of being equal to $R^{F_S}$, or equal to one another?

694496,"Motivations for and connections between the topologies of Vietoris, Fell and Chabauty","My main interest is in the Chabauty topology on the space of closed subgroups of a locally compact topological group, merely out of curiosity. Wikipedia states ""it is an adaptation of the Fell topology construction, which itself derives from the Vietoris topology concept."" So, to understand the one, one could be served by understanding the other two. Unfortunately topology and functional analysis are not among my strong suits, so I am looking to grasp the moral purpose or design behind these topologies as well as see how they are connected to each other. Perhaps some motivation is necessary in order to see that the Chabauty topology is interesting in the first place. For $({\Bbb R},+)$ , the proper closed subgroups are the cyclic ones $\alpha\Bbb Z$ , $\alpha\in\Bbb R^{+}$ . The space of closed subgroups ${\rm Cha}(\Bbb R)$ is then a kind of moduli space of discrete lattices. (It seems people use the notation ${\cal C}(G)$ for this topological space, but I want to distinguish it from the various spaces of continuous maps or the group ${\rm C}^*$ -algebra.) The space ${\rm Cha}(\Bbb C)$ is homeomorphic to the $4$ -sphere, and the subspace comprised of lattices of $\Bbb C$ is homeomorphic to the product of an open interval with the complement of the trefoil knot in the $3$ -sphere. Questions . What is the main idea behind these three topologies respectively; what kind of information are they intended to capture? What do they say about the original space or topological group? In what way does the Fell topology derive from the Vietoris topology, and in what way does the Chabauty topology derive from the Fell topology? Some definitions, more for my sake than anyone else's. Let $X$ be a topological space. Denote by $K(X)$ the collection of compact subsets of $X$ . For open subsets $U\subseteq X$ define $U^+=\{ K\in K(X):K\cap U\ne\varnothing\}$ , $U^-=\{K\in K(X):K\subseteq U\}$ . Then the Vietoris topology on ${\cal P}(X)\setminus\{\varnothing\}$ has as subbase all the $U^+$ and $U^-$ as $U$ ranges over the open subsets of $U\subseteq X$ . A complex inner product space $H$ is a Hilbert space if it is closed with respect to the metric induced by the inner product. The norm of a linear operator between normed vector spaces is defined by $\|A\|:={\rm sup}\|Av\|/\|v\|$ over $v\ne0$ . A ${\rm C}^*$ -algebra is an algebra of continuous linear endomorphisms of a Hilbert space which is closed in the norm topology and closed under taking adjoints. A ${}^*$ -homomorphism $A\to B$ of ${\rm C}^*$ -algebras is an algebra homomorphism which is bounded as a linear operator and commutes with taking adjoints. The group ${\rm C}^*$ -algebra of a topological group $G$ is the completion of $C_c(G)$ [the algebra of $\Bbb C$ -valued continuous functions from $G$ with compact support] with respect to the norm $\|f\|_{{\rm C}^*}:=\sup_\pi\|\pi(f)\}$ where $\pi$ is taken over ${}^*$ -representations of $C_c(G)$ on Hilbert spaces. The Fell topology is the topology on the dual space of ${\rm C}^{*}(G)$ . Let ${\rm Cha}(G)$ denote the collection of closed subgroups of a locally compact topological group $G$ ; the Chabauty topology it is endowed with admits as neighborhood basis the sets $${\cal V}_{K,U}(C)=\{D\in{\rm Cha}(G):D\cap K\subset CU,~C\cap K\subset DU\} $$ as $C$ ranges over ${\rm Cha}(G)$ , $K$ ranges over compact subsets of $G$ and $U$ ranges over open neighborhoods of $G$ 's identity element.","['operator-algebras', 'topological-groups', 'functional-analysis']"

Anyway, I started reading the book ""Stochastic Differential Equation"" by B. Oksendal, and I'm having some problems in understanding. Given a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ , $X : \Omega
 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a random variable if $X$ is a $\mathcal{F}$ -measurable function, or equivalently, if $$ X^{-1}(U) = \{\omega \in \Omega; X(w) \in U\} \in \mathcal{F} $$ for all the open set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ . My main problem is that I always thought that $$X \in \Omega$$ while the book by B. Oksendal asserts that $X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and hence $X(\omega) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for $\omega \in \Omega$ . For example, consider a fair dice. Then, $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ .
One can be concerned to evaluate the probability that the dice result is even. In this case, we write: $$P(X \in \{2, 4, 6\}) = ...$$ In general, the probability of an event $U \subset \Omega$ ( $U \in \mathcal{F}$ ) is normally written as follows: $$P(X \in U)$$ This notation suggest me that $X \in \Omega$ .

The proof goes like this: $A = X - (U_2\cup ...\cup U_n)$ is closed and since {$U_i$} covers $X$, $A \subset U_1$.  Since $X$ is normal, there is an open set $V_1$ such that $A \subset V_1$ and $\overline{V_1} \subset U_1$.  The collection {$V_1, U_2, ..., U_n$} covers X.  In general, given open sets $V_1, ..., V_{k-1}$ such that {$V_1, ...,V_{k-1}, U_k, U_{k+1},...,U_n$} covers $X$, let $A = X - (V_1\cup ...\cup V_{k-1}) - (U_{k+1}\cup ...\cup U_n)$.  $A$ is closed so there exists an open set $V_k$ such that $A \subset V_k$ and $\overline{V_k} \subset U_k$.  {$V_1, ...,V_k, U_{k+1},...,U_n$} is an open cover of $X$.  At the $n$th step of the induction, our result is proved. This obviously generalizes to a countably infinite open cover.  What about an uncountable open cover (of nonempty sets)?  Does the proof below work? Suppose $X$ is a normal space and {$U_\alpha$}$_{\alpha \in J}$ is an open cover of $X$ where $J$ is an uncountable index set and each $U_\alpha$ is nonempty.  There is an order relation on $J$ that is a well-ordering by the well-ordering theorem.  Let $\alpha_0$ be the smallest element of $J$.  The set $A = X - \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J - \{\alpha_0\}} U_\alpha$ is closed and is a subset of $U_{\alpha_0}$ so there is an open set $V_{\alpha_0}$ such that $A \subset V_{\alpha_0} \subset \overline{V_{\alpha_0}} \subset U_{\alpha_0}$.  Then {$U_\alpha\space\vert\space\alpha \in J - \{\alpha_0\}$}$\cup${$V_{\alpha_0}$} is an open cover of $X$.  Let $\mathcal{C}$ = {open sets $V\space\vert\space\overline{V} \subset U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \in J$} and $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of functions mapping a section of $J$ into $\mathcal{C}$. For all $\alpha \in J$, let $B_\alpha = \{V \in \mathcal{C}\space\vert\space \overline{V} \subset U_\alpha$ and $X - \bigcup\limits_{\lambda < \alpha}f(\lambda) - \bigcup\limits_{\lambda > \alpha}U_\lambda \subset V$ for some $f \in \mathcal{F}$ with domain $S_\alpha$}.  If it's unclear, a section of $J$ is just $S_\alpha =$ {$\lambda \in J\space \vert\space \lambda < \alpha$} for some $\alpha \in J$.  Let $\mathcal{B}$ = {$B_\alpha\space\vert\space\alpha \in J$}.  By the axiom of choice, there is a choice function $c : \mathcal{B} \longrightarrow \bigcup\limits_{B \in \mathcal{B}}B = \mathcal{C}$ such that $c(B) \in B\space\forall\space B \in \mathcal{B}$.  Define $\rho : \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ by $\rho(f) = c(B_\alpha)$ where $S_\alpha$ is the domain of $f$.  Then by the general principle of recursive definition, there is a unique function $h : J \longrightarrow\mathcal{C}$ such that $h(\alpha) = \rho(h\vert S_\alpha)$.  So for each $\alpha \in J$, we have an open set $V_\alpha = h(\alpha) = \rho(h\vert S_\alpha) = c(B_\alpha)$ such that $\overline{V_\alpha} \subset U_\alpha$ and $X - \bigcup\limits_{\lambda < \alpha}h(\lambda) - \bigcup\limits_{\lambda > \alpha}U_\lambda \subset V_\alpha$.  The set {$V_\alpha$} is an open cover of $X$.",['general-topology']

694962,What is (fundamentally) a coordinate system ?,"Consider the following construction of vectors and points. Let's start with a vector space , or more specifically a coordinate space $F^N$ over a field $F$ and of $N$ dimensions. The elements of this vector space are vectors $\vec{v}$ and we can express their coordinates using a basis $(\vec{e_1}, \vec{e_2}, ... \vec{e_N})$ of the vector space (and any coordinate space comes with a standard basis ). Using this vector space, one can construct the related affine space $A$, whose elements are points. As there is no origin in an affine space, to locate a point one need a coordinate system which can be specified by an origin and a basis. (First question: does this construction make sense ?) My problem, is that I am not sure to understand what is fundamentally a coordinate system... My problem is the following: in 3D cartesian coordinates , it is pretty simple: the vector space is $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, so we can construct the related affine space with points, and by specifying an origin $O$ plus the standard basis, we can identify the position of the point $P$ by the coordinates of the vector going from $O$ to $P$. But with spherical coordinates I am lost and I am not sure to really understand what mathematical objects is/are $(r, \theta, \phi)$ and $(\vec{e_r}, \vec{e_\theta}, \vec{e_\phi})$: in the contrary of cartesian coordinates, the basis $(\vec{e_r}, \vec{e_\theta}, \vec{e_\phi})$ will change from one point to another. Why is that ? Is the vector space underlying $(r, \theta, \phi)$ and linked with $(\vec{e_r}, \vec{e_\theta}, \vec{e_\phi})$ the same as the one we use in the case of cartesian coordinates.

Attempted solution: First derivative There is a hint that the derivative looks like this: $$J(u + h) - J(u) = \langle J'(u), h\rangle + o(\|h\|)$$ I do not really understand why, since this is not the definition of the Frechet derivative. However: $$
\begin{split}
J(u + h) - J(u) &= \int_0^1\left(u\left(t\right) + h\left(t\right)\right)\left(u\left(1 - t\right) + h\left(1 - t\right)\right)dt - \int_0^1u\left(t\right)u\left(1 - t\right)dt \\
&=\int_0^1 h(t)(u(1 - t) + h(1 - t))dt + \int_0^1u(t) h(1 - t)dt \\
&= \int_0^1h(t) h(1 - t)dt + \int_0^1h(t)u(1 - t)dt + \int_0^1u(t)h(1 - t)dt 
\end{split}
$$ 
Where it can be shown that the last two integrals are actually equal. Which results in: $$J(u + h) - J(u) = \int_0^1 h(t) h(1 - t)dt + 2 \int_0^1 u(1 - t) h(t) dt$$ If we now recall the definition of scalar product in $L^2[0, 1]$: $\langle f, g \rangle = \int_0^1 f(t) g(t) dt$ then we can rewrite our result as: $$J(u + h) - J(u) = \langle 2 u(1 - t), h(t)\rangle + \langle h(t), h(1 - t)\rangle$$ Let's now show $\langle h(t), h(1 - t)\rangle = o(\|h\|)$:
$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|\langle h(t), h(1 - t)\rangle|}{\|h(t)\|} \le \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\|h(t)\| \|h(1 - t)\|}{\|h(t)\|} = \lim_{h \to 0} \|h(1 - t)\| = 0$$ Where the inequality is the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality. Second derivative There are no hints this time but here is the definition from class (B is a matrix): $$ J'(u + p) - J'(u) = Bp + o(\|p\|)$$ As far as I understand, $J''(u) = B$ at point p. Which leaves me with: $$J'(u + p) - J'(u) = 2(u(1 - t) + p(1 - t)) - 2 u(1 - t) = 2p(1 - t) = o(\|p\|)$$ Which means $J''(u) = B = 0$. My current answer to the problem: $J'(u) = 2 u(1 - t)$ $J''(u) = 0$ My questions: Is my answer correct, are there any mistakes? Why does the first hint look like this?

695192,Elementary proof of geometric / negative binomial distribution in birth-death processes,"The birth-death process concerns a population of $n_0$ individuals, each of which reproduces and dies at a constant rate as time $t$ increases from $t=0$ . Each individual splits into two individuals (birth) with rate $\lambda$ , and each individual dies at rate $\mu$ . One can conceptualize this process as a continuous-time Markov chain with states $0, 1, 2,\ldots$ representing the current size of the population. We are interested in the distribution $P_t(n) = P(N(t) = n)$ of the population size $N(t)$ at time $t$ . It can be shown that for the pure birth process ( $\mu = 0$ ), at fixed time $t$ the probability $P_t(n)$ has the form of a negative binomial distribution: $$
P_t(n) = {n-1 \choose n-n_0} (e^{- \lambda  t})^{n_0} (1 - e^{-\lambda t})^{n - n_0}.
$$ A similar negative binomial formula can be derived for a nonzero death rate. This is typically proven by solving a PDE involving the generating function governing the process; see for example these slides or (Grimmett and Stirzaker, section 6.11). It would be interesting to prove the formula in a more elementary fashion, by identifying how exactly the birth-death process corresponds with the process that defines the binomial distribution. This is similar to how combinatorialists want a bijective proof of an enumeration theorem after they find a generating function proof. I have not been able to find the desired elementary proof, even for the special case of a pure birth process starting from 1 individual ( $n_0 = 1$ and $\mu = 0$ ), in which case the negative binomial simplifies to the geometric distribution. Does anyone know where to find it, or how to derive it from first principles? Here's what I've got so far: recall that the negative binomial distribution is the distribution of ""the number of successes in a sequence of Bernoulli trials before a specified number of failures occurs."" In the case of the formula above, we can compare with the formula on wikipedia to see that the number of successes is $n - n_0$ , the number of failures is $n_0$ , the success probability on each Bernoulli trial is $1 - e^{\lambda t}$ , and the failure probability is $e^{\lambda t}$ . The failure probability is recognizable as the probability that an exponentially distributed waiting time (with rate $\lambda$ ) exceeds $t$ . Thus, the formula seems to be telling us that the birth process can be simulated by throwing exponential waiting times onto the real line until $n_0$ of them have exceeded the threshold $t$ . But it's unclear what realizations of the process are generated by this simulation method, and how it is able to automagically place the proper probabilistic weight on these realizations.","['stochastic-processes', 'markov-process', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"

My initial idea was to start with the definition of limit (assuming $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n = l$): $$|\sqrt{a_n} - \sqrt{l}| = |\frac{(\sqrt{a_n} - \sqrt{l}) (\sqrt{a_n} + \sqrt{l})}{(\sqrt{a_n} + \sqrt{l})}| = |\frac{a_n - l}{(\sqrt{a_n} + \sqrt{l})}|$$ The problem is that $\sqrt{a_n} + \sqrt{l}$ could be less than $1$. And therefore I can't continue the proof using this approach. Edit: forgot to mention that $a_n$ converges is another hypothesis.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'analysis']"
695412,Derivative of a Vector with respect to its norm (special relativity),"I came across an equation (related to special relativity) that requires me to to take a derivative of a vector with respect to to it's own norm. In a bit more detail, what I mean is, let: $$\vec T(\tau) = \{T_1(\tau), T_2(\tau), \dotsb, T_t(\tau)\}$$
$$\vec X(\tau) = \{X_1(\tau), X_2(\tau), \dotsb, X_x(\tau)\}$$
With $\vec T$ and $\vec X$ having dimensions $t$ and $x$ respectively and both being vector functions of $\tau$. Also let: $$\tau^2 = w^2 - s^2 = \vec T \cdot \vec T - \vec X \cdot \vec X$$ Where: $$w = \lVert \vec T \rVert \qquad s = \lVert \vec X \rVert$$ Knowing that:
$$d\tau^2 = dw^2 - ds^2= d\vec T \cdot d\vec T - d\vec X \cdot d\vec X$$ How then, can take the derivative $\frac {d\vec T}{dw}$? It may be useful to know that $d\vec X = [\beta]\cdot d\vec T$, where $[\beta]$ is a constant matrix of dimension $x\times t$.

695432,Does an infinite collection of circles accumulates at a circle?,"There is an infinite collection of closed circles in the plane, all within a finite bounding square. Does it contain an infinite sequence of circles that converge to a circle? Assume that a point is a circle of radius 0, and that convergence is defined by symmetric difference (i.e. the area of the symmetric difference between the sequence and the limit goes to 0). I thought of the following proof: Represent each circle as a triple $(x,y,r)$. Since the collection is bounded, the $x$, $y$ and $r$ values of all circles are bounded. Therefore, there is an infinite sequence of triples $(x_i,y_i,r_i)$, that converges to a triple $(x_L,y_L,r_L)$. The limit triple represents a circle, and the symmetric difference between the circles in the sequence and the limit circle goes to 0. My questions are: Is this proof correct? Is there another proof, that uses purely geometrical considerations (i.e. does not transform the circles to triples of numbers)?","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'sequences-and-series', 'circles']"
695448,When is the global section functor exact?,"Given sheaves $\mathcal{F}_1,\mathcal{F}_2, \mathcal{F}_3$ on some scheme $X$, and an exact sequence $$ 0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{F}_2\rightarrow  \mathcal{F}_3\rightarrow  0 ,$$ when do we know that the global section functor $\Gamma(X,*)$ is exact when applied to the above exact sequence? The global section functor is left exact, so I suppose I am asking when does $\Gamma(X,*)$ preserve a surjective morphism of sheaves. Of course we know this when $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is an affine scheme and the $\mathcal{F}_i$ are coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. Are there more notable cases, and more importantly, do we know of an if and only if condition on the scheme and sheaves to ensure that the global section functor is exact?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

The inclusion $[GL_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^{2}\mathbb{Z}),GL_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^{2}\mathbb{Z})] \subseteq SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^{2}\mathbb{Z})$ is relatively clear.

695466,Incorrect calculation? (Statistics homework),"I'm currently working on some statistics homework, and as you might guess from the title, I got the wrong result, and the reason why I'm writing it here is because I don't have a clue why it's wrong. The question is as follows: A student is driving from city A to B. On route to B there's 2 intersections where she will randomly choose which one to pass through. 1.
At the first intersection she can choose between Bridge A or B in the proportion 3:1 (Meaning bridge A is chosen with probability 3/4). At bridge A there's a 0.5 probability of being delayed by 0 mins. and a 0.5 probability of being delayed by 10mins. At bridge B there's a 0.4 probability of being delayed by 5mins. and a 0.6 probability of being delayed by 7mins. 2.
At the second intersection she can choose between road A or B in the proportion 2:1. At road A there's a 0.5 probability of being delayed by 1min. and a 0.5 probability of being delayed by 2 mins. At road B there's a 0.1 probability of being delayed by 3mins. and a 0.9 probability of being delayed by 9mins. Out from this answer the following: Let X be a stochastic variable which shows the student's total delay in minutes between city A to B. Calculate the following: $S_x$, $E(X)$, $Var(X)$ and $\sigma_X$ Let's just take the calculation for $S_X$ since I find that one to be the hardest. Since X is stochastic I can find that it has the following values:
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 In order to calculate $S_x$ I have to calculate the expected value which I did as: E(X)=$\frac{(1+2+3+6+7+8+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+16+19)}{15} = 9.2667$ Then I believe I calculate $S_X$ the following way: $S_X$ = $\sqrt(\frac{E(X)}{N})$ = 4.8634 Unless I'm using the wrong method (which I most likely am), then there's something missing in my book because what my teacher calls $S_X$ ""Support"". Which I can find nothing about, I also tried to look up standard deviation, which also turned out to be wrong.",['statistics']
