3123743,Can you help me solve this algebra problem?,"Hi I need to solve this problem and I don’t know how. I’d appreciate your help. If $x - \frac{ayz}{x^2} = y - \frac{azx}{y^2} = z - \frac{axy}{z^2}$ and $x\neq y\neq z$ , then $$x - \frac{ayz}{x^2} = y - \frac{azx}{y^2} = z - \frac{axy}{z^2} = x + y + z - a$$ I think I need to $x^3 - ayz = x^2k$ $y^3 - azx = y^2k,$ $z^3 - axy = z^2k$ then to multiply both sides of each equality by some quantity, add them all together and factor but I don’t know how to find that quantity.","['algebra-precalculus', 'systems-of-equations']"

3123791,When is $E[X|\mathcal{G}]\geq Y$?,"Consider random variables $X,Y$ on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal F,\Bbb P)$ , and let $\mathcal G$ be a sub- $\sigma$ -algebra.

3123912,How can I find out if two parabolas will share an integer in their sequence?,I have two parabolas: $x = 4y^2 + 48y + 24$ $x = 4y^2 + 4y$ When I graph $4y^2+4y$ it hits the number $x=24$ at $y = -3$ and $y = 2$ When I graph $4y^2 + 48y + 24$ it hits $x = 24$ at $y = -12$ and $y = 0$ I'd like to be able to tell no matter what the two parabola equations are if they will share a common integer.

3123913,Permutation Matrix - Distance to Identity,"Given a permutation matrix , I want to compute the minimum number of pairwise row swaps I need to make so that I end up with the identity. An example: $$\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\1 & 0& 0 & 0\\ 0&0&0 & 1\\0&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0& 1 & 0\\ 0&0&0 & 1\\0&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0& 1 & 0\\ 0&1&0 & 0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1& 0 & 0\\ 0&0&1 & 0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}$$ This permutation needed 3 swaps to return to identity. Note that it does not have to be adjacent rows for a swap to be allowed, even though this example only had those. My reason for wanting to compute this is really because I want to know how many permutations require an even number of swaps, out of all the $n!$ possibilities. I was thinking that if I had a formula I might be able to derive this, or at worst brute force count all permutations for reasonable values of $n$ . Any help would be much appreciated! Edit : I seem to have stumbled across a much harder (though interesting) problem while trying to show something that seems to be a known thing - that there are exactly $n!/2$ permutations requiring an even number of swaps. While I really appreciate the answer given to my original question (accepted as it does what I asked for), I would really like a proof/explanation of why there are equal amounts of even/odd permutations?","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
3123914,Definition approximation of smooth function by Morse function,Hi everyone I'm currently studying Morse Theory on my own and I've come across a proposition where I would need a precise definition of what is meant. Here is the proposition: Let $M$ be a manifold that can be embedded as a submanifold into a Euclidean space and let $ f : M → \mathbb{R}$ be a $C_{\infty}$ function. Let $k$ be an integer. Then $f$ and all its derivatives of order $≤ k$ can be uniformly approximated by Morse functions on every compact subset. The part that confuses me is what is meant by uniform approximation of the derivatives of order ${}$ $ ≤ k$ . An example of a problem I have is with what is meant by derivatives of order bigger than 1. Because from my (very basic) understanding of differential geometry we cannot even generally define the second derivative. It's only well defined on the set of critical points. I have a lot of other problems with this proposition and I took a look at the proof hoping to find answers to my questions. Sadly the books only proves the case $k=0$ . What I would need is a very pedantic restatement of the proposition that explains what we mean by approximating higher order derivatives on a compact set and what we even mean by higher order derivatives. I tried to look on the internet but this exact proposition was nowhere to be found so I really hope someone here knows what it means.,"['morse-theory', 'smooth-manifolds', 'analysis', 'differential-geometry']"
3123923,"Find all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $1/a + 1/b = 3/2018$ and $a,b$ are positive integers","I gave this problem my best attempt and am now trying to understand the solution for it. This is problem #1 to the 79th William Lowell Putnam Math Competition. This is the given solution by Kiran Kedlaya and Lenny Ng: By clearing denominators and regrouping, we see that the given equation is equivalent to $(3a−2018)(3b−2018) = 2018^2$ . Each of the factors is congruent to $1 \text{ (mod } 3)$ . There are $6$ positive factors of $2018^2 = 2^2 · 1009^2$ that are congruent to $1\text{ (mod } 3)$ : $1$ , $2^2$ , $1009$ , $2^2 · 1009$ , $1009^2$ , $2^2 · 1009^2$ . These lead to the 6 possible pairs: $(a,b)$ $= (673,1358114)$ , $(674,340033)$ , $(1009,2018)$ , $(2018,1009)$ , $(340033,674)$ , and $(1358114,673)$ . As for negative factors, the ones that are congruent to $1\text{ (mod }3)$ are $−2$ , $−2 · 1009$ , $−2 · 1009^2$ . However, all of these lead to pairs where $a ≤ 0$ or $b ≤ 0$ . I don't fully understand these things: Each of the factors is congruent to $1\text{ (mod }3)$ : I think congruence means the ability to translate into something else using some rules, so it seems like they are saying that $(3a-2018) = 1$ and $(3b-2018) = 1$ . I'm also not sure why they wrote $1\text{ (mod }3)$ because 1 % 3 = 1 , so why not just say $1$ ? There are $6$ positive factors of $2018^2 = 2^2·1009^2$ that are congruent to $1\text{ (mod }3)$ : $1$ , $2^2$ , $1009$ , $2^2·1009$ , $1009^2$ , $2^2·1009^2$ : Here it seems like they are listing all of the ways to make $2018^2$ , but if they are saying that $1$ is a possible factor then wouldn't $2018^2$ be its pair and therefore must be in this list? Why wouldn't they put it into this list? These lead to the 6 possible pairs: $(a,b) = (673,1358114)$ , $(674,340033)$ , $(1009,2018)$ , $(2018,1009)$ , $(340033,674)$ , and $(1358114,673)$ : How did they get these pairs?","['contest-math', 'algebra-precalculus', 'integers', 'inequality']"
3123945,$\lim$ vs $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ in the proof of convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution,"I am studying the various types of convergence for random variables, in particular how convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution. Let $(X_n)_n$ be a sequence of random variables and let us assume that $X_n$ converges in probability to $X$ . After some computations, we can write: $$F_X(t-\epsilon) - P(|X_n - X|> \epsilon) \le F_{X_n}(t) \le F_X(t+\epsilon) + P(|X_n - X|> \epsilon) $$ where $F_X(t)$ is the CDF of $X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ . At this point I don't understand why several authors (e.g. example of proof ) use $\limsup\limits_{n \to \infty}$ and $\liminf \limits_{n \to \infty}$ to show that the limit of $F_{X_n}(t)$ is bounded by $F_X(t-\epsilon)$ and $F_X(t+\epsilon)$ for $n \to \infty$ ; in particular they write: $$F_X(t-\epsilon) \le \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} \mbox{inf } F_{X_n}(t) \le \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} \mbox{sup } F_{X_n}(t) \le F_X(t+\epsilon)$$ and then they conclude the proof by resorting to the continuity of $F_X(t)$ . My question is, why is it not sufficient to just compute the limits of the elements of the inequality above obtaining $F_X(t-\epsilon) \le \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} F_{X_n}(t)\le F_X(t+\epsilon)$ ? In particular we can define: $$a_n := F_X(t-\epsilon) - P(|X_n - X|> \epsilon)$$ $$b_n :=F_X(t+\epsilon)+ P(|X_n - X|> \epsilon)$$ for all $n$ , then knowing that $a_n \le F_{X_n}(t) \le b_n$ , from one of the comparison theorems for sequences and the converge in probability of $X_n$ , we obtain: $$\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} a_n = F_X(t-\epsilon) \le \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} F_{X_n}(t)\le \lim \limits_{n \to \infty} b_n = F_X(t+\epsilon)$$ Am I missing anything?

3123994,Proof of L'Hospital's Rule on Zorich book: an unclear step.,"The proof of L'Hospital's rule on Zorich, Mathematical Analysis I, chapter 5.4, pag. 251, starts with: if $g'(x)\neq 0$ we conclude on the basis of Rolle's theorem that $g(x)$ is strictly monotonic on $(a,b)$ . In the hypothesis we have only that $g:(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}$ is a differentiable function on $(a,b)$ . So my question: we don't know if $g'(x)$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ or not. So, $g'(x)$ could jump from negative values to positive values without passing through $0$ , in theory. Consequently I think that, to conclude that $g(x)$ is strictly monotonic on $(a,b)$ when $g'(x) \neq 0 \;\;\forall x \in (a,b)$ , we have to say: let's assume that $\exists x_1,x_2\in (a,b)$ such that $g'(x_1)>0$ and $g'(x_2)<0$ ; then for Darboux property of derivative we would have that $g'(x)$ assumes all values between $g'(x_1)$ and $g'(x_2)$ , and so even $0$ , that is a contradiction for the hypothesis that $g'(x) \neq 0 \;\;\forall x \in (a,b)$ . Consequently $g'(x)$ has a definite sign that is the same $\forall x \in (a,b)$ and so $g(x)$ is strictly monotonic. Is it right?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

3124012,$f$ is Riemann integrable if the set of discontinuities is measure zero.,"Let $f$ be a bounded function on a compact interval $J$ , and let $I(c,r)$ denote
  the open interval centered at $c$ of radius $r>0$ . Let $osc(f,c,r)=\sup|f(x)-f(y)|$ , where
  the supremum is taken over all $x,y\in J\cap I(c,r)$ , and define the oscillation of $f$ at $c$ by $osc(f,c)=\underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim}osc(f,c,r)$ . Clearly, $f$ is continuous
  at $c\in J$ if and only if $osc(f,c)=0$ . (a) For every $\epsilon>0$ , the set of points $c$ in J such that $osc(f,c)\geq \epsilon$ is compact. (b) If the set of discontinuities of $f$ has measure $0$ , then $f$ is Riemann integrable. I've already proved part (a) so this is my attempt at
part (b) My proof attempt: Proof. Fix $\epsilon>0$ . Define \begin{equation*}
D_\epsilon=\{c\in J: osc(f,c)>\epsilon\}
\end{equation*} Then $D_\epsilon$ is the set of discontinuities of $f$ . By hypothesis, $D_\epsilon$ is measure zero. 
We will prove that $f$ is Riemann integrable by showing that there exists a partition $P$ such that $|U(P,f)-L(P,f)|<\epsilon$ , where $U(P,f)$ and $L(P,f)$ are the upper and lower sums
of $f$ over partition $P$ , respectively. By Observation 3 of the Exterior Measure in Stein, there exists an open set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $D_\epsilon\subset \mathcal{O}$ and $m(\mathcal{O})\leq \epsilon.$ By theorem 1.3, $\mathcal{O}$ can be written as
a disjoint countable union of open intervals $(I_j)_j$ . By Part (a), $D_\epsilon$ is compact.
Since $(I_j)_j$ covers $D_\epsilon$ , we need only a finite sub-cover to cover $D_\epsilon$ , say $(I_j)^{k}_{1},$ and denote the collection as $\mathcal{F}$ . Then \begin{equation*}
m(D_\epsilon)\leq m(\underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I)\leq m(\mathcal{O})\leq \epsilon
\end{equation*} Hence, we now have a finite cover of $D_\epsilon$ whose ""total length"" is $\leq \epsilon$ . Since $J$ is closed and $I\in \mathcal{F}$ is open, it follows that $J\setminus \underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I$ is closed. Since $J\setminus \underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I\subset J$ , it is also compact. 
Any continuous $f$ over a compact interval is uniformly continuous. Therefore, there
exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x,y\in J\setminus \underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I$ satisfying \begin{equation*}
|x-y|<\delta \implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon. 
\end{equation*} Let $P_1$ be a partition of $J$ such that every pair of consecutive points is within $\delta$ of
each other, e.g. one way of constructing such a set is to partition $J$ into $\frac{|J|}{2^n}$ length intervals for large enough $n\in \mathbb{N}$ . Now define $\hat{P}_1$ to be a partition of $J$ such that \begin{equation*}
\hat{P}_1=P_1\setminus \{x\in P_1: x\in \underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I\}.
\end{equation*} Next, define $P_2$ to be a partition of $J$ such that $P_2$ is the set of the end points of $I_1, I_2,...,I_k$ , and $J$ . Finally, let $P$ be the common refinement of $P_1$ and $P_2$ , i.e. $P=P_1\cup P_2$ . We will now show that $P$ is the desired partition of $J$ . Enumerate the points of $P$ as $x_1,x_2,...,x_N$ . 
Denote $\Delta x_i=|x_{i+1}-x_i|$ for $i=1,...,N-1$ . Denote as well the interval $[x_{i+1},x_i]$ as $\nabla x_i.$ If two consecutive points in $P$ are also in $P_2$ , denote the length instead
by $\Delta y_i$ . Moreover, for each $\Delta x_i$ , let $m_i$ and $M_i$ be the infimum and supremum
of $f$ over $\nabla x_i$ , respectively.  Define \begin{equation}
C:=2\cdot \sup\{|f(x)|:x\in J\}<\infty \quad  \text{ Since $f$ is bounded.}
\end{equation} Finally, observe \begin{align*}
|U(P,f)-L(P,f)|&=|\underset{x_i\in P}{\sum} M_i\Delta x_i-
\underset{x_i\in P}{\sum} m_i\Delta x_i| \\
&=|\underset{x_i\in P}{\sum} (M_i-m_i)\Delta x_i| \\
&=|\underset{x_i\in P_1}{\sum} (M_i-m_i)\Delta x_i + 
\underset{x_i\in P_2}{\sum} (M_i-m_i)\Delta y_i| \\
&\leq \underset{x_i\in P_1}{\sum} |(M_i-m_i)|\Delta x_i +
\underset{x_i\in P_2}{\sum} |(M_i-m_i)|\Delta y_i \\
&\leq \epsilon|J| + C\epsilon \\
&\text{ By Uniform Continuity of $f$ over $J\setminus \underset{I\in \mathcal{F}}{\bigcup}I$} \\
&=\epsilon(|J|+C) \\
\end{align*} As niether $|J|$ nor $C$ depend on $\epsilon$ , this completes our proof. The definition of the Riemann Integrable I use is from Rudin's PMA. Any corrections of the proof or comments on style are highly appreciated. I recognize the proof is really long and I appreciate
the time of anybody who parses through it.","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

Assume α is the angle for each segment.

Weak convergence $\iff$ convergence of $\phi$ On the RHS, $N(0,g^{'}(\mu)^{2} \sigma ^2) \sim  g^{'}(\mu) \sigma N(0,1) = g^{'}(\mu) \sigma \mathscr{X}$ where $\mathscr{X}$ is standard normal $\phi_{g^{'}(\mu) \sigma  \mathscr{X}}(t) = \phi_{\mathscr{X}}(g^{'}(\mu) \sigma t) = e^{-\frac{g^{'}(\mu)^{2} \sigma ^2 t^2}{2}}$ because $\phi_{\mathscr{X}}(t) = e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}$ On the LHS: The characteristic function is $E[e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\overline{X_n}) - it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)}] = e^{-it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)} E[e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\overline{X_n})}]$ Because RHS has $g^{'}(\mu)$ , I am thinking of expanding $e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\overline{X_n})}$ using Taylor's which is: $e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\overline{X_n})} \approx e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)} + e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)}it\sqrt{n}g'(\mu)(\overline{X_n}-\mu)+e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)}it\sqrt{n}g'(\mu)[(it\sqrt{n}g'(\mu))^2 + it\sqrt{n}g^{''}(\mu)](\overline{X_n}-\mu)^2$ So $LHS = e^{-it\sqrt{n}g(\mu)} E[e^{it\sqrt{n}g(\overline{X_n})}] = 1+[(it\sqrt{n}g'(\mu))^2 + it\sqrt{n}g^{''}(\mu)]E[\overline{X_n}-\mu]^{2} =$ $1+[(it\sqrt{n}g'(\mu))^2 + it\sqrt{n}g^{''}(\mu)](\frac{\sigma^2}{n}+\mu^2)$ I am stuck at this point as $RHS$ has $e$ to the some power which means $LHS$ needs to have a $(1+x/n)^n$ kind of a situation which I don't.

3124315,$Var(f(X))$ when $Var(X)\to 0$,"I am a newcomer to measure-theoretic probability theory, and I have some confusion with how the notion of variance is handled in this framework. Intuitively speaking, for a measurable function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ and a random variable $X$ , if $Var(X)=0$ , then $Var(f(X))$ should be $0$ , and when $Var(X)\to 0$ , the same should happen to $Var(f(X))$ . However, mathematically there seems to be some intricate issues involved with this intuition. For example, let's take $X\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ . The variance of $f(X)$ is defined by $$Var(f(X))=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)^2\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx - (\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}dx)^2$$ Two issues: $Var(f(X))$ is simply undefined when $\sigma=0$ !! When we let $\sigma\to0$ , by dominated convergence and with some manipulations, we can see that $Var(f(X))$ approaches $0$ . See, for example: Proof that the limit of the normal distribution for a standard deviation approximating 0 is the dirac delta function. . But this only works for $f$ belonging to the Schwartz space. So I am quite confused about this limitation, since we are restricted to such a small class of measurable functions, while intuitively $Var(f(X))$ should go to $0$ as $Var(X)\to 0$ for any $f$ that's not ""crazily behaving"". Now I am very confused about how variance in measure-theoretic probability works. When we talk about $\lim_{Var(X)\to0}Var(f(X))$ , are we really stuck with $f$ being a Schwartz function?

I basically don't understand the way the proof is given in my text as well as some references online. They basically do the same thing. THEOREM : Let $m,x$ be positive integers such that $\gcd(m, x) = 1$ . Then $x$ has a multiplicative inverse
modulo $m$ , and it is unique, $\mod m $ . Now,  this is a sufficient and  necessary condition, but  let's just look  at the  proof  that it is the sufficient condition which is given in my texts. Proof : Consider the sequence of m numbers $0,x,2x,...,(m−1)x$ . We claim that these are all distinct, $\mod m$ . Since there are only $m$ distinct values modulo $m$ , it must then be the case that $ax = 1 \mod m$ ,  for
exactly one $a (\mod m)$ . This a is the unique multiplicative inverse.
To verify the above claim, suppose that $ax = bx \mod m$ for two distinct values $a,b$ in the range $0 ≤ a,b ≤
m−1$ . Then we would have $(a−b)x = 0 \mod m$ , or equivalently, $(a−b)x = km$ for some integer $k$ (possibly
zero or negative). But since $x$ and $m$ are relatively prime, it follows that $a−b$ must be an integer multiple
of $m$ . This is not possible since $a,b$ are distinct non-negative integers less than $m$ . What I don't see particularly in this proof is the connection betweent the $\gcd$ being one and the existence of the multiplicative  inverse. What I do  see instead is that the proof that the multiplicative inverse is  unique. What is the connection of  the $\gcd$ being $1$ and  the existence of  the multiplicative  inverse $\mod m$ ?","['elementary-number-theory', 'gcd-and-lcm', 'proof-explanation', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The identity element is the constant function whose value is the identity of $G$ , and the (group) inverse of any function $g$ is the function that maps $x \in S$ to the group inverse of $g(x)$ in $G$ . If we replaced ""group"" with ring (also commutative ring, ring with identity, and both), vector space, or algebra (assuming for the last two that a scalar field is given), the analogous statement is still true. This clearly isn't the case for fields though. Assuming we want to make this work, the ""zero function"" would be the one that maps identically to zero. A function $f$ , such that $f(x) = 0$ for at least one $x \in S$ , but is not $0$ for at least one other $x \in S$ , is not equal to the zero function, but also doesn't have a multiplicative inverse.

3124672,"Example 2, Sec. 28, in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed.: Does every compact ordered (or well-ordered) set always have a largest element.","Here is Example 2, Sec. 28, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: ... Consider the minimal uncountable well-ordered set $S_\Omega$ , in the order topology. The space $S_\Omega$ is not compact, since it has no largest element. However, it is limit point compact. Let $A$ be an infinite subset of $S_\Omega$ . Choose a subset $B$ of $A$ that is countably infinite. Being countable, the set $B$ has an upper bound $b$ in $S_\Omega$ ; then $B$ is a subset of the interval $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ of $S_\Omega$ , where $a_0$ is the smallest element of $S_\Omega$ . Since $S_\Omega$ has the least upper bound property, the interval $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ is compact. By the preceding theorem, $B$ has a limit point $x$ in $\left[ a_0, b \right]$ . The point $x$ is also a limit point of $A$ . Thus $S_\Omega$ is limit point compact. Now my question is related to the following part of this example. The space $S_\Omega$ is not compact, since it has no largest element. In general, we can prove the following: Let $X$ be a simply ordered set, in the order topology. If $X$ has no smallest element or if $X$ has no largest element, then $X$ is not compact. In other words, if a simply ordered set $X$ in the ordered topology is compact, then $X$ must have a smallest element and a largest element. Proof: Suppose that $X$ has a smallest element $a$ but that $X$ has no largest element. Then the collection $$ \mathscr{A} \colon= \left\{ \ [a, x) \ \colon \ x \in X, x > a \ \right\} $$ is an open covering of $X$ . If there were a finite sub-collection of $\mathscr{A}$ that also covered $X$ , say, the collection $$ \mathscr{A}_0 \colon= \left\{ \ \left[ a, x_1 \right), \ldots, \left[ a, x_n \right) \ \right\},$$ then we would have $$ X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \left[ a, x_i \right) = \left[a, x_* \right), \tag{1}$$ where $$ x_* \colon= \max \left\{ \ x_1, \ldots, x_n \ \right\}. $$ But this would yield a contradiction because $x_*$ is an element of $X$ , by our construction, but from (1) we would obtain $x_* \not\in X$ . Hence $X$ cannot be compact if $X$ has no largest element even if $X$ does have a smallest element. By analogous reasoning we can also show that if $X$ has no smallest element, then $X$ cannot be compact, even if $X$ does have a largest element. Am I right? Now what about the converse? That is, if $X$ is a simply ordered set having a smallest element and a largest element, then can we prove that $X$ is always compact?","['general-topology', 'proof-verification', 'compactness']"

In my mind, $\mathbb C_p$ and $\mathbb C$ seem like fundamentally different objects, so I'm wondering what such embeddings would look like, or how to think about this. In particular, when speaking of things like the Teichmuller character $\omega: (\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\times\rightarrow \mathbb C_p^\times$ , which maps $a\in(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\times$ to the unique root of $X^{p-1}-1$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ reducing to $a$ mod $p$ , how can we consider $\omega$ as a complex character? Washington says that the Teichmuller character ""may be regarded as coming from a complex character if desired, but the choice is noncanonical and depends on an embedding of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_{p-1})$ into $\mathbb Q_p$ "". Is the idea that we'd define the (complex) Teichmuller character to just send $a$ to a complex root of $X^{p-1}-1$ . (Which root? I'd guess fixing $\zeta=\zeta_{p-1}$ primitive then setting $a\mapsto \zeta^a$ ?).  This would then lead us to define the $p$ -adic character by embedding $\mathbb Q(\zeta_{p-1})$ into $\mathbb Q_p$ ... Is this the right idea? EDIT: My definition of the complex Teichmuller character doesn't work, as $\omega (ab)\neq \omega(a)\omega(b)$ .

Remarks: The number of digits of an integer $n$ is $1+\lfloor\log_{10}n\rfloor$ where $\lfloor\cdot\rfloor$ denotes the floor function. This means that $s(a^b)<9+9\lfloor b\log_{10} a\rfloor$ as each digit takes a value of at most $9$ . From this plot it is evident that the equality will never hold for $a\ge 9$ , after checking the first $21$ values of $b$ . Therefore it suffices to consider $2\le a\le 8$ . I have excluded the case $b=1$ as it is trivial - it forces $a$ to be a single-digit integer. In PARI/GP the code is given by mfun(b)={for(i=2,8,for(j=2,b,if(sumdigits(i^j,10)==i*j,print(i,"" "",j))));} and tests up to $b\le 10^6$ verify the above conjecture.

From here , the upper bound $a\le 23$ is apparent and for these values of $a$ , we can form the upper bound $b\le 22$ as there will be no solutions when the red line lies above the blue lines. This $23\times22$ grid can be computed through software and it is found that the only solutions are $$(a,b)=(2,2),(3,6),(6,3).$$ The similarity in the first two solutions with the conjectured solutions may only be coincidental.

3125092,Criteria for Leyland Numbers to be Prime,"Inspired by a Black Pen Red Pen video on Youtube where he proved that $4^{2019}+2019^4$ is not prime using the Sophie Germain identity, I began exploring when numbers of the form $a^b+b^a;a,b\in\mathbb{N}$ are prime.  Without loss of generality, I restrict it to $a\leq b$ . It is trivial to see that there are an infinitude of primes where $a=1$ .  I then discovered from OEIS that numbers of the form $a^b+b^a;a,b\in\mathbb{N}\setminus1$ are called Leyland numbers, and that the sequence of known Leyland primes (in addition to 3) is sequence A094133 on OEIS, and can be found on Leyland's website in a table along with Leyland PRPs. http://www.leyland.vispa.com/numth/primes/xyyx.htm . What I wanted to do is to find criteria that will indicate whether or not a Leyland number is prime.  The first obvious criteria I found is that if $GCD(a,b)=n>1$ , then $a^b+b^a\equiv0 \mod n$ , and therefore $a,b$ must be coprime.  The second obvious criteria was that $a+b$ must be odd, because otherwise $a^b+b^a$ would be even. I then proceeded to explore further to try to find limitations on which values for $a$ will never result in a Leyland prime, and if there were any values of $a$ for which a prime or composite number for $b$ will always or will never return a Leyland prime. What I have found so far: For $a=2$ , a necessary condition for $a^b+b^a$ to be prime is that $b\equiv3\mod 6$ , because if $b$ is even then $a^b+b^a$ will also be even, and if $b$ is odd but not divisible by 3, then $a^b+b^a$ will be divisible by 3.  However, the condition that $b\equiv3\mod 6$ is not sufficient for $a^b+b^a$ to be a Leyland prime, as for example $2^{27}+27^2=73\times521\times3529$ . For $a=4$ , there are no Leyland primes.  This can be proven, as for odd $b$ , $4^b+b^4$ is factorable using the Sophie Germain identity, and for even $b$ , $4^b+b^4$ is even. For $a=6$ , I have not found any Leyland primes, but cannot prove that they don't exist.  As $a,b$ must be coprime, we get that $b$ must be odd but not divisible by 3.  An additional criteria is that $b$ must be divisible by 7, because $6^b\equiv-1\mod7$ for any odd $b$ , and $b^6\equiv1\mod7$ for any $b$ which is not divisible by 7.  Therefore, all that remains is to test for $b\equiv7\mod42$ and $b\equiv35\mod42$ .  Looking at the table on Leyland's website, I have not found any pattern that I can use to prove that there are no such Leyland primes, although if any exist, they must be with $b>7500$ or slipped through the cracks of the computations. All other single digit numbers produce at least one Leyland prime, but I do not see any pattern to determine when they will or won't produce Leyland primes (other than the trivial criteria mentioned above). Does anyone have any insights for how to determine more precise criteria for how to produce Leyland primes?","['number-theory', 'primality-test', 'prime-numbers']"

It seems reasonable that this conjecture fails for small groups as they don't have quite enough structure for verbal subgroups to tell them apart. Is this conjecture true for sufficiently large groups? That is, does there exist some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that any counterexample pair $(G,H)$ must have order $|G|,|H|\le n$ ?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'verbal-subgroups']"

3125569,"Must a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ intersect the curves $\eta + \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n}$ ($n \geqslant 1$)?","Must a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ intersect
  the curves $\eta + \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n}$ ( $n \geqslant 1$ )? This is the fourth - and with any luck, the last! - in a series
of distinct but related questions.  I believe that the three previous
questions have all been answered satisfactorily.  At any rate, this
is indisputably true of the most recent one (which was also asked by
me). It summarises the history of the problem so far, and it makes a
general conjecture, which was found to be too general: If $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb{C}$ is continuous and $\gamma(b)=-\gamma(a)$ , must the curves $\gamma$ and $e^{ic}\gamma$ intersect for all real $c$ ? . The present question is trivial for $n = 1$ .  That its answer is
positive for $n = 2$ is almost a consequence of the two
detailed answers [also, for all I know, of the third, less detailed
answer] to the second question in the series: A continuous curve intersects its
90 degrees rotated copy? . The similar proposition for $\mathbb{R}^k$ ( $k \ne 2$ ) is trivially
true if $k = 1$ , and (almost as trivially) false if $k > 2$ and $n > 1$ . For example, if $k = 3$ , any polygonal path whose vertices
are $(0, 0, 0)$ , $(1, 0, 0)$ , $(1, 1, 0)$ and $(1, 1, 1)$ , in that
order, does not intersect its image under translation via the vector $\left(\frac1n, \frac1n, \frac1n\right)$ . For $\mathbb{R}^2$ , if there is any counterexample [it seems entirely
possible to me that there is one - but my judgement has been
almost infallibly wrong, so far!], then there exists a
counterexample that is piecewise linear, i.e. a polygonal path. Proof For all $z \in \mathbb{R}^2$ [I'll use $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}$ almost interchangeably, whenever the use of the complex
number system seems advantageous, but no serious complex analysis is
ever involved - only the basic properties of the complex
exponential function], and $\delta > 0$ , let $N(z, \delta)$ denote
the open disc with centre $z$ and radius $\delta$ . For all $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ , write $N(S, \delta) = \bigcup_{z \in S} N(z, \delta)$ . $N(S, \delta)$ is open, for all $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ . If $S$ is
connected, then so is $N(S, \delta)$ . A connected, open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is path-connected.  Indeed (as is well-known, easily
proved, and important for the argument here), any two of its
points can be joined by a polygonal path. (The edges of this path can
even be chosen to be all parallel to one or other of the axes, but
we'll not need this result.) For any curve [by which term of course I mean a continuous function] $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ , denote its image $\eta([a, b])$ by $[\eta]$ : this is a connected, compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . For $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ , define the curve $\eta + v \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ by $(\eta + v)(t) = \eta(t) + v$ ( $a \leqslant t \leqslant b$ ). Clearly $[\eta + v] = [\eta] + v$ , where $S + v = \{z + v : z \in S\}$ ( $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ ). If $[\eta] \cap [\eta + v] = \emptyset$ , then, by compactness,
there exist $z^* \in [\eta]$ , $w^* \in [\eta + v]$ such that $|z - w| \geqslant |z^* - w^*|$ for all $z \in [\eta]$ , $w \in [\eta + v]$ . Let $|z^* - w^*| = 2\delta$ . Then $\delta > 0$ ,
and $N([\eta], \delta) \cap N([\eta + v], \delta) = \emptyset$ . Let $\eta^*$ be a polygonal path joining $\eta(a)$ to $\eta(b)$ in $N([\eta], \delta)$ . Then $\eta^* + v$ is a polygonal path joining $\eta(a) + v$ to $\eta(b) + v$ in $N([\eta + v], \delta)$ , whence $[\eta^*] \cap [\eta^* + v] = \emptyset$ . If $\eta$ is a counterexample to the conjecture, then $[\eta] \cap [\eta + v] = \emptyset$ , where $$
v = \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n} = \frac{\eta^*(b) - \eta^*(a)}{n},
$$ for any polygonal path $\eta^*$ joining $\eta(a)$ to $\eta(b)$ . It
has just been shown that there exists such an $\eta^*$ satisfying $[\eta^*] \cap [\eta^* + v] = \emptyset$ , i.e. $\eta^*$ is also a
counterexample. $\square$ A conjecture only slightly weaker than the present one is: If $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous and $\gamma(b) = -\gamma(a)$ , then the curves $\gamma$ and $e^{i\pi/n}\gamma$ intersect for every positive integer $n$ . Proof The proposition concerning $\gamma$ is trivial if $0 \in [\gamma]$ , so we assume $0 \notin [\gamma]$ . In
that case, there exists a branch $\eta$ of $\operatorname{Log}\gamma$ on $[a, b]$ . [My answer ,
to the second question in this series of four, quotes passages from
an elementary treatment of the existence of branches of $\operatorname{Arg}\gamma$ , of which this is a simple consequence.] Conversely, given any curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ , we
can define $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ by $\gamma(t) = \exp(\eta(t)) \ne 0$ ( $a \leqslant t \leqslant b$ ); and
then $\eta$ is a branch of $\operatorname{Log}\gamma$ on $[a, b]$ . For any two curves $\gamma, \eta$ that are related in the way just
defined, we have: $$
\gamma(b) = -\gamma(a) \text{ if and only if, for some }
m \in \mathbb{Z}, \, \eta(b) - \eta(a) = (2m + 1){\pi}i.
$$ Suppose that the main conjecture of the present question is true; and
that we are given a curve $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ . Let $\eta$ be as just defined in terms of $\gamma$ .  Then, for every
positive integer $n$ , $[\eta]$ intersects $[\eta + v]$ , where $$
v = \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{(2m + 1)n} = \frac{i\pi}{n}.
$$ But $[\gamma] = \exp([\eta])$ , and $[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big] = \exp([\eta] + v) = \exp([\eta + v])$ ;
therefore $[\gamma]$ intersects $[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big]$ , as
required. There is also a partial converse.  Suppose now that the ""slightly
weaker"" conjecture is true; and that we are given a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ . If $\eta(b) = \eta(a)$ , there
is nothing to prove, so from now on we suppose that $\eta(b) \ne \eta(a)$ . The truth-value of the proposition concerning $\eta$ is unaffected by
translation, rotation, and scaling, so we can assume without loss of
generality that $\eta(a) = 0$ and $\eta(b) = i\pi$ . Now let $\gamma$ be defined in terms of $\eta$ as above.  Because $\gamma(a) = 1$ and $\gamma(b) = -1$ , we can apply the given conjecture, concluding that $[\gamma] \cap \big[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big] \ne 0$ . Unfortunately, all we can deduce from this is that for every positive
integer $n$ , there exists an integer $m$ such that $\eta$ intersects $\eta + \left(2m + \frac1n\right)(\eta(b) - \eta(a))$ . If there is
an argument that enables us to recover the full conjecture from this
unsatisfactory result, I haven't thought of it yet.  This explains, I
hope, what I meant by saying that the second conjecture is ""slightly
weaker"" than the main one; also, why I said at the outset that the
answers to the second question in the series ""almost"" prove this
question's main conjecture in the case $n = 2$ . $\square$ Experiments by several users drawing polygonal paths in GeoGebra
[other programs are available!] have so far failed to produce a
counterexample to the conjecture (expressed in the ""weaker"" form).
Here is a failed attempt for $n = 3$ (illustrating the main form of
the conjecture in this question): It's a racing certainty that someone will now produce a
counterexample with embarrassing ease. :)","['plane-curves', 'general-topology', 'geometry']"

3125585,Minecraft water spreading initial arrangements,"So, as most Minecraft players quickly learn, the best way to flood an area is to place water along a diagonal. There are of course other ways to flood the same area with the same number of buckets placed. For those not familiar with the game, we can think of this as a different sort of game. We start with a $0, 1$ matrix of size $n$ . At each step, every $0$ with at least two $1$ 's directly adjacent to it is replaced with a $1$ . Its not hard to see that this process always terminates. The objective is to end with a matrix of all $1$ 's with a minimal number of $1$ 's to start. Its not hard to see that an optimal initial arrangement is the identity matrix, and that the minimum number of starting $1$ ’s is $n$ . Of course, there are other matrices that work, such as $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}.$$ We quickly see that we are looking for permutation matrices, but not every permutation matrix works. For example $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$ does not work. The question then is this: which permutation matrices do work? Is there a nice characterization? We can think of forming ""blocks"" and then growing blocks together if they share a corner, but is there something else we can say? It appears the counter example given is some kind of forbidden configuration. Edit: it appears that there are non-permutation matrices that work, such as $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Regardless, we can add the assumption that we are working only with permutation matrices. Thus we only consider expansion across corners as the other type of growth cannot happen. Now if we consider starting with a permuation matrix, and grow it to its final state, we see that the final states are a bunch of disjoint squares of filled in area. We can shrink these squares to a single cell, so equivalently, we ask ourselves which permutation matrices exhibit no growth at all?","['matrices', 'forbidden-subgraphs']"

3125633,Optimal way to stack deck against uniformly random opponent?,"A card game is played by splitting a face-down shuffled deck evenly between two players. The deck consists of cards numbered 1-52. Each player reveals the top card of their deck, and the player whose card has higher rank scores 1 point. Both cards are then discarded. The process is repeated until both decks have been depleted. The winner of the game is the one with the largest number of points. Suppose you can cheat at this game: first, you know the contents, but not the order, of both decks. Second, each round before your opponent reveals a card, you can choose which card in your deck you will reveal. (That is, you can choose which card you will reveal next based on all of the information you have up to the point where the opponent will reveal a new card.) My friend suggested that even if you can cheat in this way, there is no strategy you can play which will give you a higher score on average than playing at random. This doesn't seem true to me, but I've had trouble proving that cheating helps in simple cases, or proving (e.g. inductively) that it doesn't matter. Any help is appreciated. Edit: If it helps, I've previously considered a simpler version of this game, in which you know the fixed order of your opponents' cards, which are played in order. If you are allowed to cheat in this deterministic version, you can optimize your score according to the following strategy. First, it suffices to establish a mapping between their cards and your cards --- the card you will play when they play their card.  To create this mapping, list your cards in ascending order of rank and list their cards in the same way.  If their highest ranked card beats your highest ranked card, pair it with your lowest-ranked card. Otherwise, pair it with the lowest-ranked card you have that still beats it. Remove both cards, and repeat this process. Edit 2: Conjecture . Even if you cheat, there is no strategy which performs better than chance. In particular, regardless of which strategy you employ, your expected score is simply the probability that a random card from your deck beats a random card from their deck, times the total number of cards in each deck. If you create an $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$ entry is 1 if your $i$ th card beats their $j$ th card, your expected score on any strategy is 1/ $n$ times the sum of the entries of the matrix. I think I have an inductive proof of this, but am still figuring out how to write it out formally.","['game-theory', 'card-games', 'probability']"

I want to explicitly determine the prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}_K$ over $11\Bbb Z$ . By considering the minimal polynomial $x^2-x-1$ of $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ modulo $11$ I find: $$x^2-x-1\equiv (x+7)(x+3)\pmod{11}.$$ This tells me that the ideals over $11\Bbb Z$ are $\langle 11, x + 7 \rangle, \langle 11, x + 3 \rangle$ , with $x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ . I.e. the ideals are $$\left\langle 11, \frac{7 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right\rangle \text{ and } \left\langle 11, \frac{15 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right\rangle.$$ I know that this $K$ has class number $1$ , i.e. $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a PID.

This leads me to believe that the second one is: $$\left\langle 11, \frac{15 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right\rangle = \left\langle \frac{-7 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right\rangle.$$ (After seeing this, one can see that I could just subtract $11$ from $\frac{15+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ in the second ideal, but hindsight is $\sim20/4$ ) Question: Is there a faster procedure to find the principal prime ideals lying over some $p\Bbb Z$ explicitly?

However, this case seems to be quite different from that one, and thus it most likely can not be solved by exactly the same method. The abelian case is still somewhat obvious: If $\frac{G}{H} \cong C_p$ for some prime $p$ , then $G$ is an abelian group of exponent $p$ for some prime $p$ , which results $G \cong C_p^n$ for some natural $n$ .

3125942,About change of coordinates of vector fields in smooth manifold theory,"Background Suppose $M$ is a smooth $n$ -manifold and $(U,\varphi=(x^i))$ a smooth chart on $M$ . For each point $p\in U$ we know that $(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_p)_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for the tangent space $T_pM$ . If $(\tilde U,\tilde\varphi=(\tilde x^i))$ is another smooth chart on $M$ with $U \cap \tilde U\ne \emptyset$ , then for each point $p\in U \cap \tilde U$ we have the following formula for the basis - change: $$(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}|_p,\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}|_p)=(\frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde x^1}|_p,\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde x^n}|_p) \cdot \operatorname{Jac}(\tilde\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(p)} \quad[1]$$ where $\operatorname{Jac}(\tilde\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1})_{\varphi(p)}$ is the Jacobian matrix of $(\tilde\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1})$ in $\varphi(p)$ . Fact Suppose we have the following vector field on $\mathbb{R}^2$ : $X=2x \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ . Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}, (x,y)\mapsto x^2$ . We want to compute the coordinate expression for $X$ in polar coordinates (on some open subset on which they are defined) and show that it is not equal to $\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}+ \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}$ . My understanding and execution Let $M=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 : x>0\}$ , and $N=(0,+\infty)\times (-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ . Let $F=M\to N, (x,y)\mapsto (\sqrt {x^2+y^2},\arctan\frac{y}{x})$ . Then $F$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $F^{-1}:N \to M, (r,\theta)\mapsto (r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)$ . Issue 1: Polar coordinates are, by definition, the component functions of the map $F$ , right? So we have $F=(r, \theta)$ . Great Issue 2: I have an ambiguity on how to interpret $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$ . (a) Should I interpret $(r,\theta)$ also as standard coordinates on $N$ and thus $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$ are simply the ordinary partial derivatives on $N$ ? (Just like $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ on $M$ ?) (b) I know that if $M$ is a smooth $n$ -manifold and $(U,\varphi=(x^i))$ is a smooth chart on $M$ , then for each point $p\in U$ we have that $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_p=d\varphi^{-1}_{\phi(p)}(\partial_i|_{\phi(p)})$ where $\partial_i$ is the standard $i$ -th partial derivative on $\mathbb{R}^n$ . So thinking of my $F$ as a smooth chart, I should interpret $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(x,y)}=dF^{-1}_{F(x,y)}(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_{F(x,y)})$ for each $(x,y)\in M$ . Which one between (a) and (b) is the correct interpretation? Issue 3 The vector field I'm looking for, say $Y$ , should be the pushforward of $X$ by $F$ ? Issue 4 Applying formula [1] I have $$(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_{(x,y)},\frac{\partial}{\partial y}|_{(x,y)})=(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(x,y)},\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}|_{(x,y)}) \cdot \operatorname{Jac}(F)_{(x,y)}$$ which i can rewrite $$(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)},\frac{\partial}{\partial y}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)})=(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)},\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}) \cdot \operatorname{Jac}(F)_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)},$$ from which I have $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}=\cos\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}-\frac{\sin\theta}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)};$$ finally we have $$X=2x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=2r\cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}=2r\cos^2\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}-2\sin\theta\cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}|_{(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)}.$$ I think there is something wrong with this and whit using formula [1] in this context. Instead, using the formula for computing the pushforward of $X$ by $F$ , I got $$(F_*X)_{(r\,\theta)}=2r\cos^2\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}|_{(r,\theta)}-2\sin\theta\cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}|_{(r,\theta)}$$ which sounds correct. So is there some ""abuse of notation"" which is confusing me? Am I right in saying that strictly speaking I cannot use formula [1]?

3126036,Computation of Christoffel Symbols for pullback on 2-torus,"I am currently doing some exercises to prepare for an Oral next month and have found myself stuck on computing Christoffel symbols for a certain metric $h$ defined below. The setup is as follows: We have a chart $(\theta^1,\theta^2)$ on $T^2$ and a map $\Phi : T^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ \begin{align*}
\Phi(\theta^1,\theta^2) = \left((2+\cos\theta^1)\cos\theta^2, (2+\cos\theta^1)\sin\theta^2,\sin \theta^1\right).
\end{align*} We are asked to define a metric $h$ on $T^2$ as the pullback of the Euclidean metric $$h= \Phi^*(dx^i \otimes dx^i)$$ and then compute the Christoffel symbols for $\nabla$ on $(T^2,h)$ . My progress thus far has been to compute $$
h(\xi,\eta)=\left( \xi^j \frac{\partial\Phi^m}{\partial\theta^j}  \right) \left( \eta^j \frac{\partial\Phi^m}{\partial\theta^j}\right),
$$ with summation over $m,j$ implicit. Writing out the matrix for $h$ is tractable. I find $$
\begin{bmatrix}
5-4\sin\theta^1& 2 (2-\sin \theta^1)(2+\cos \theta^1)\sin \theta^2 \cos \theta^2\\
 2 (2-\sin \theta^1)(2+\cos \theta^1)\sin \theta^2 \cos \theta^2 & \left(2+\cos\theta^1\right)^2 
\end{bmatrix}
$$ However, when I start computing the Christoffel symbols I run into what feels like a computational nightmare, mainly due to the rather ugly inverse matrix for $h$ . Is there any way around this or should I just suck it up (also, did I make a computation error?)? Edit: Let me just add that Mathematica gives me the following inverse matrix (to motivate my lack of computational morals with $x=\theta^1,y=\theta^2$ ) $$

$$ find all values of $a, p \in\Bbb R$ for which $x_n$ converges. First of all I tried to assume that the limit indeed exists. Then it must match a fixed point of the following equation: $$
x = x^2 + (1-2p)x + p^2
$$ Which solving for $x$ gives: $$
(x-p)^2 = 0 \iff x = p
$$ By this if the recurrence converges then it must follow that: $$
\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = p
$$ Lets now take a closer look at the recurrence. I've shown that it must describe a monotonically increasing sequence, namely: $$
x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + (1-2p)x_n + p^2 \\
x_{n+1} = x_n^2 - 2px_n + p^2 + x_n \\
x_{n+1} = (x_n - p)^2 + x_n \\
x_{n+1} - x_n = (x_n - p)^2 > 0 \implies \boxed{x_{n+1} > x_n}
$$ By this the sequence in monotonically increasing no matter what initial conditions are given. At this point I'm lost. How do one deduce the constraints for $a, p$ for $x_n$ to be convergent. Since the sequence is increasing I guess the problem may be reduced to ""find the values of $a, p$ for which the sequence is bounded"". Then the result should follow by monotone convergence theorem. The answer section suggests that: $$
0 \le p - a \le 1
