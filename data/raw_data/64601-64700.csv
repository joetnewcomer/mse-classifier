  \cfrac{1}{2

}=\frac{\color{red}7}{10}=\frac{\color{red}7}{\color{green}3+\color{red}7}\text{, etc.}

Let's say the first CF equals $\frac{a}{b}$, then the second CF will equal $\frac{b}{a+b}$. Hence
\begin{equation}
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a+b}=\frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{ab+b^2}=1+\frac{a^2}{ab+b^2}>1

Here is the hint from the problem: when $f$ is compactly supported on the compact interval $[a,b]$, then $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt-(x-a)\lambda$ is continuous on the compact interval; apply the Rising Sun lemma to $F(x)$.

For an unbiased estimator $\mathcal{I}(\theta)^{-1}$ is an lower bound for the MSE of estimating the parameter $\theta$. The reason that Fisher chose this definition for the Information measure was very intuitive:
We are interested in relative changes in $f(x;\theta)$, i.e. $\frac{\partial f(x;\theta)/\partial \theta}{f(x;\theta)}=\frac{\partial \log f(x;\theta)}{\partial \theta}$. In particular, we are interested in average of this quantity regardless of its sign.

$$
\begin{align}

= & \underbrace{\sin\alpha\  \overbrace{\cos\beta\cos\gamma\cos\delta\cos\varepsilon\cos\zeta}^{\text{5 cosines}}+\cdots\cdots}_{\text{6 terms}} \\[8pt]
& \underbrace{{} - \overbrace{\sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma}^{\text{3 sines}}\  \  \overbrace{\cos\delta\cos\varepsilon\cos\zeta}^{\text{3 cosines}}-\cdots\cdots}_{\text{20 terms}} \\[8pt]
& \underbrace{\overbrace{{} + \sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma\sin\delta\sin\varepsilon}^{\text{5 sines}}\ \ \cos\zeta+ \cdots\cdots}_{\text{6 terms}} 
\end{align}
$$ But that superficial appearance vanishes when there are infinitely many terms: every term has only finitely many sine factors and cofinitely many cosine factors: $$
\sin\left( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha_k \right) = \sum_{\text{odd }k} (-1)^{(k-1)/2} \sum_{\begin{smallmatrix} A \subseteq\{1,2,3,\ldots\} \\  |A|=k \end{smallmatrix}} \prod_{k\in A} \sin\alpha_k \prod_{k\not\in A}\cos\alpha_k.
$$ This is of course an instance of the fact that when one enumerates the finite subsets of a set, then the set of complements is the same as the set enumerated if the set is finite, but quite different if the set is infinite. But until one looks at the infinite case, one doesn't know that sine rather than cosine is the one that will appear only finitely many times. So I have a somewhat open-ended question: Where else in mathematics is symmetry in finite cases replaced by extreme asymmetry in infinite cases?","['trigonometry', 'set-theory', 'compactness', 'big-picture']"

Pick a $G$-invariant Riemannian metric and suppose that $v \in T_pM-0$ is annihilated by $L_p$. Taking the exponential map with respect to the metric, we see that all the points on the geodesic $\exp_p (tv)$, $t \in \mathbb R$, would be fixed by $\exp(sX) \in G$, $s \in \mathbb R$, contradicting to $p$ being isolated.

\dot{y} = y^{2} + 2\cos(t)\sin(t) - \sin^{4}(t)

and investigating the solution. My understanding is that I should look at the first variational equation
\begin{equation*}
\dot{y} = A(t)y

where
\begin{equation*}
A(t) = df_{y}(t,\eta), \quad A(t+T) = A(t), \quad f(t,y) = \dot{y}(t).

f(t,y) &= y^{2} + 2\cos(t)\sin(t) - \sin^{4}(t) &&\Rightarrow \\
f_{y}(t,y) &= 2y &&\Rightarrow \\
A(t) &= 2\sin^{2}(t).
\end{alignat*} Now $A(t)$ is periodic with period $T=2\pi$, and my next understanding is that stability of the solution depends on the sign of the eigenvalue for this one-dimensional system which are the Floquet multipliers (or characteristic exponents).

\begin{alignat*}{2}
\bar{a} &= \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}A(s)ds \\

752373,Is the Axiom of Choice implicitly used when defining a binary operation on a quotient object?,"Let's say you have a group $(G,\cdot)$ and you have a normal subgroup $N$ (note we are considering this only as a set). And now we want to define a binary operation $\star$ on $G/N$ such that $(G/N, \star)$ is a group. Every element of $G/N$ looks like $aN$ for some $a\in G$. Thus it seems perfectly natural to want to exploit the group-theoretic structure of the elements of the cosets and define $aN\star bN:= a\cdot bN$. Most textbooks do this and then they quickly turn around and prove this operation is well-defined. I understand all of this and why they do it, but doesn't this construct pre-suppose a choice function on $G/N$? It seems to me that the definition of the binary operation $\star$ is a quick abbreviation of all of this: let $f$ be a choice function for $G/N$. Then for all $A$ and $B$ in $G/N$ define $A\star B:= (f(A)\cdot f(B))N$. And the usual well-defined check follows up to show that this operation does not depend on the choice-function $f$, shows that this operation is associative, and has an identity. But the independence of the choice-function does not excuse the need for the existence of a choice function. And we are not always guaranteed a choice function (in AC's absence). It bothers that we appear to need an extremely strong principle for something so fundamental but trivial in Group Theory. (Of course, there is a similar problem with rings and ideals in Ring Theory) I have a couple questions. Is my supposition correct? That is, in the usual construction of the quotient operation, is there an assumption of a choice-function? If that is the case, could we---at the cost of being long-winded and perhaps tedious---define a quotient operation that does not presuppose a choice function?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'axiom-of-choice']"
752389,Proving a set of $2\times 3$ matrices is a manifold?,"The way I have always been told to check if something is a manifold (I haven't had a whole lot of experience with them), is to check if the derivative of the function representing the loci of the graph satisfies the implicit function theorem.

As part of that, I need to show that one-point compactification of the real line, $\mathbb{R}\cup\infty$ is homeomorphic to the unit circle.
I've come so far to have defined a function $f$ with $(x,y)=(\cos(2\arctan(t)),\sin(2\arctan(t)))$, which should map the reals onto the unit circle and be bijective and continuous. Now since my domain is compact, if I can show that the unit circle is Hausdorff, I can conclude that my function is a homeomorphism, correct? However, which topology would I use for that? Also, I am having a hard time trying to prove that f is surjective. Thought about dividing it up into two functions, from reals to $(-\pi,\pi)$ and then to the unit circle, but that doesn't really seem to work either. Any thoughts? Topology is confusing... (Intuitively, I absolutely see why all this should be the case, however I am struggling with the formal stuff.) Edit: Okay I have tried the approach of defining an inverse function, suggested and then proving that it is continuous. So far I've got: $$g=\tan\left(\frac{1}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\right)$$ Problem is, that this function is not bijective, so there is something missing (case distinction?) but I can't figure out what... At least within $\left(\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ it seems to work, and it's easy to show that combining f and g gives the identity.

A scratch of my proof will be I am trying to triangularize B and D and A as well, then because the determinant is just the product of diagonal element I can show $\det(A)=\det(B)\det(D)$. If I used row swaps and multiply a row by a scalar, I will have shown $K\det(A)=K\det(B)\det(D)$, where K is some constant due to the row operations. This then gives the result I want.

752521,How do I show a mapping is a homomorphism?,"I don't want to make this question too broad, or non-specific.  I'll will discuss a simple situation so we can all share a common context, but my question is less about this particular group, and more about the strategy of showing that a particular mapping you're interested in is a valid homomorphism. Let $G$ be a group, and let a non-identity $(\ne 1)$ element $a \in G$ be such that $a^2=1$.  Then $K:=\left\{ 1, a \right\} \lt G$.  I don't see right away that $K \lhd G$, so I want to find a homomorphism with kernel $K$. If we were to show that $K$ is normal, we would need $gK = Kg$ $\forall g \in G$, but since $g1 = 1g$, this would imply we need $ga = ag$ $\forall g \in G$.  (I point this out because I'll refer back to it later.  I'm willing to hear arguments about $K$ being normal, but that's not the point of this question.) Defining a mapping $\phi:G \rightarrow G$ such that $\phi(a)=1$ (and necessarily $\phi(1) = 1$) would certainly put $a$ in the kernel if $\phi$ is indeed a homomorphism as we'd like.  But how would I clearly show that this is a homomorphism, with exactly $K$ as its kernel?  Surely I can't just note that $\phi(ag) = \phi(a)\phi(g) = \phi(g) = \phi(g)\phi(a)=\phi(ga)$.  This would depend on $\phi$ being a homomorphism, and would be an example of assuming the conclusion.  If $\phi$ were a homomorphism and well defined, this would show ... well, I guess it would not show that $ag = ga$, but it would show that $ag$ and $ga$ are both members of the same equivalence class in the quotient group formed by modding $K$ out of $G$. I freely admit that my background is strong in analysis and weak in algebra.  When I watch an algebraist at work, everything looks quick and simple and leaves the impression that I'm watching magic, as if we could prove anything we want to, which clearly isn't so.

752815,"How does the base of a group determine the ""sort"" of the elements in the group","I'm trying to study groups in Mathematica, and I've asked a question on Mathematica.SE that perhaps only someone from Math.SE could answer. Related: How does GroupActionBase affect the order of elements in a group? We typically don't think of elements of groups, or even sets to have an inherent ""sort order"", but a computer must select one in order to operate on, and display the group.  Mathematica uses a command called GroupActionBase to determine the sort order of the elements in a group, but it doesn't specify how.  At first I thought the term base in this context was specific to Mathematica, but I was surprised when I looked it up and saw that it was an algebra term.  That page has an example that I've copied from the help file (the help file doesn't say much more than what I've copied to that question).  Can someone familiar with group bases clue me in on how Mathematica might be using them to determine what order to represent and display elements in?  (Mathematica treats every group as its isomorphic subgroup of some $S_n$, so elements are represented in cycle form.) Edit Here are some additional examples I've generated that might help. As noted on the other site, if I don't provide a complete base, Mathematica extends it somehow (unspecified) to form a complete base.  I also note that if I'm understanding a base correctly, a base for $S_n$ would consist of $n$ (or $n-1$?) points with at most $n!$ different ways to order them, but the number of elements in $S_n$ itself is $n!$, so there are $(n!)!$ different ways to order them.  This would seem to me that I can't force any order I want, and the examples below seem to follow some similar pattern indicating that.

752855,Differentiable functions defined on a regular surface,"First, recall a general definition of a differentiable function as follows. Suppose $f :D\subset \mathbb R^3 \rightarrow \mathbb R$. Then $f$ is differentiable at
$\mathbf a \in D$ if there is a linear function $L:\mathbb R^3 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that $$\lim_{\mathbf x\rightarrow\mathbf a}\frac{\|f(\mathbf x)-[f(\mathbf a)+L(\mathbf x-\mathbf a)]\|}{\|\mathbf x-\mathbf a\|} = 0.$$ Now consider a definition of a differentiable function defined on a regular surface given in most differential geometry textbook. Let $f:V\subset S\subset \mathbb R^3\rightarrow \mathbb R$ be a function defined on an open subset $V$ of a regular surface $S$ (which itself is a subset of $\mathbb R^3$). Then $f$ is differentiable at $\mathbf p\in V$ if for some parameterization $\mathbf x: U\subset\mathbb R^2\rightarrow S$ with $\mathbf p\in \mathbf x(U)\subset V$, the composition $f\circ\mathbf x:U\subset \mathbb R^2\rightarrow \mathbb R$ is differentiable at $\mathbf x^{-1}(\mathbf p)$. My question is whether the two definitions are consistent with each other. To be more specific, if the two definitions are consistent, then Why do we need a new definition for differentiable functions defined on a regular surface which is in fact a subset of $\mathbb R^3$ anyway? What is the corresponding linear function $L$ in the second definition? Thank you!","['self-learning', 'differential-geometry']"

752989,Lefschetz duality for non-compact relative manifolds,"I'd like to use the formulation of Lefschetz duality stated here , but I can't seem to find a reference for this particular version of it, and it doesn't seem quite right to me. The exact statement in question is:
Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological space, and let $A \subset X$ be a subspace such that the complement $X - A$ is an orientable topological $n$-manifold. Then, for any abelian group $G$ and any $i$,
$$H_i(X, A; G) \cong H_c^{n - i}(X - A; G),$$
where $H_i$ and $H_c^{n - i}$ denote singular homology and compactly supported singular cohomology, respectively. The problem is, by Poincaré duality, $H_c^{n - i}(X - A; G) \cong H_i(X - A; G)$, so if the above statement is true, then $H_i(X - A; G) \cong H_i(X, A; G)$. But that definitely doesn't seem right; for example, if $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ and $A = \{(0, 0)\}$, then $H_1(X - A; G) \cong G$ because $X - A$ is homotopic to a circle, but $H_1(X, A; G) \cong \tilde{H}_1(X; G) = 0$. Is the above statement true in this generality? If so, where can I find a proof, and where is my attempt at a counterexample mistaken? If not, what's the correct formulation?

753105,Proving that Markov Chain Monte Carlo converges,"I am trying to understand how the very basic Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach works: We try to approximately calculate the expected value $E_{\pi(x)}[X]$ by drawing sequential samples from a Markov Chain $(x_0,x_1,...)$ with the stationary distribution $\pi(x)$ and  transition matrix $T(x_i|x_{i-1})$. So, according to the MCMC approach, it should be $E_{\pi(x)}[X] \approx \frac{1}{N-N_0} \sum_{i=N_0}^{N} x_i$ where $N_0$ is the point where we assume that $p(x_{N_0})$ is close enough to the stationary distribution $\pi(x)$. We simulate the Markov Chain such that $x_0$ comes from an initial distribution $p(x_0)$ and each $x_i$ comes from $T(x_i|x_{i-1})$ . I am trying to show that $\frac{1}{N-N_0} \sum_{i=N_0}^{N} x_i \rightarrow E_{\pi(x)}[X]$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. What I am doing currently is the following: 1-In order to simplify the problem I assume that $x_0$ comes already from the stationary distribution so we won't need a $N_0$ value. I have $S_N = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i$ where $x_0$ comes from $\pi(x_0)$ and each $x_i$ comes from $T(x_i|x_{i-1})$ and $(x_0,x_1,...)$ is a Markov Chain. 2-The convergence of the regular Monte Carlo is shown with the Law of Large Numbers, so I try the same approach. By using the Weak Law of Large Numbers, I want to show that $P(|S_N - E_{\pi(x)}[X]| \geq \epsilon) \rightarrow 0$ as $ N \rightarrow \infty$ where $\epsilon > 0$. 3-Weak Law of Large Numbers can be proven by using Chebyshev's Inequality. For $S_N$, I write the inequality as $P(|S_N - E[S_N]| \geq \epsilon) \leq \frac{V[S_N]}{\epsilon^2}$ where $V[S_N]$ is the variance of $S_N$ and again $\epsilon > 0$. 4-I first want to show that the expected value of $S_N$, $E[S_N]$ is equal to the expected value we are after: $E_{\pi(x)}[X]$. I showed this by using the fact that the marginal of each $x_i$ in the Markov Chain is equal to the stationary distribution $\pi(x)$: $E[S_N]=E[\frac{1}{N} (x_0 + x_1 + ... + x_{N-1})] = \frac{1}{N} (E[x_0] + E[x_1] + ... + E[x_{N-1}]) = \frac{1}{N} (E_{\pi(x)}[x] + E_{\pi(x)}[x] + ... + E_{\pi(x)}[x]) = E_{\pi(x)}[x]$ 5-Now I need to evaluate the variance of $S_N$, $V[S_N]$ in order to complete the Chebyshev's Inequality. But I failed to form a closed form expression for $V[S_N]$ as I did for $E[S_N]$ and I became stuck. I have actually two questions. First one: Is my way of proving the convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo is correct to begin with? Second one is, how can I carry on with the proof from the 5. step? It seems that the variance of the Monte Carlo sum doesn't have a closed form solution since $(x_0,x_1,...)$ are not i.i.d and come from a Markov Chain instead. Please note that I am a Computer Engineer, not exactly from a Mathematician background, so I could have done something very naive.

I used polar coordinates instead of solving explicitly in $\mathbb R^2 $, and it went as the following: $$ x = r \cos \theta, \qquad y = r\sin\theta $$ Hence, $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2y}{x^4 + y^2} = \lim_{r \to 0}\frac{r^2\cos^2\theta(r\sin\theta)}{r^4\cos^4\theta + r^2\sin^2\theta}$$ This simplifies to, $$ \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{r^3 \cos^2\theta\sin\theta}{r^2(r^2\cos^4\theta + \sin^2\theta)}$$ Simplifying $r^3/r^2$, we finally get; $$\lim_{r \to 0} \frac{r (\cos^2\theta\sin\theta)}{r^2\cos^4\theta + \sin^2\theta}$$ Now from the above, we find that as $r \to 0$ the limit is $0$.

753580,Interpolation and Taylor's Theorem,"I just answered a question where I used the fact that a $(n+1)$ -times (continuously) differentiable function $f$ interpolated by a $n$ th degree polynomial $p(x)$ through the $n+1$ points $x_0,...,x_n$ has error given by $$f(x)-p_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}\prod_{i=0}^n{(x-x_i)}$$ This seems eerily similar to Taylor's Theorem $$f(x)-T_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$ for some $\xi\in (a,x)$ . The wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation#Interpolation_error says that ""the remainder term in the Lagrange form of the Taylor theorem is a special case of interpolation error when all interpolation nodes $x_i$ are identical"" but the article it cites for that is https://math.okstate.edu/people/binegar/4513-F98/4513-l16.pdf where I find ""Although this formula for the error is somewhat reminiscent of the error term associated
with an nth order Taylor expansion, this theorem has little to do with Taylor expansions."" Obviously the claim given in the wikipedia article is not justified, but I am not inclined to dismiss such a remarkable resemblance to mere chance. The proof is as follows: write $R(x)$ for the remainder at $x$ and let $$g(t)=R(t)-\frac{R(x)}{W(x)}W(t),\;\;W(t)=\prod_{i=0}^n{(t-x_i)}$$ Then $g(x)=0$ - take $x\in (x_0,x_n)$ - and $g(x_i)=0,\;\;i=0,...,i=n$ because $R(x_i)=0$ . Thus it has $(n+2)$ zeros in the interval and by repeated application of Rolle's Theorem there exists a $\xi$ such that $$g^{(n+1)}(\xi)=f^{(n+1)}(\xi)-\frac{R(x)}{W(x)}(n+1)!=0$$ from which the error formula follows. We can do the same with Taylor's formula. Let $$g(t)=R(t)-\frac{R(x)}{W(x)}W(t),\;\;W(t)=(t-a)^{n+1}$$ Then $g(a)=g(x)=0$ so $\exists c_0\in (a,x): g'(c_0)=0$ . Now $g'(a)=g'(c_0)=0$ so $\exists c_1\in (a,c_0): g''(c_1)=0$ etc. until finally $$\exists\xi: g^{(n+1)}(\xi)=f^{(n+1)}(\xi)-\frac{R(x)}{W(x)}(n+1)!=0\implies R(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$ This simply cannot be a coincidence - can anyone explanation the connection?","['truncation-error', 'power-series', 'calculus', 'interpolation', 'numerical-methods']"
753623,A connected linearly ordered set is a linear continuum,"Let $X$ be a linearly ordered set in the order topology which is connected. Show that $X$ is a linear continuum. A linear continuum is a linearly ordered set $X$ with more than one element that is densely ordered ( i.e. , between any two members there is another), and has the least upper bound property ( i.e. , every nonempty subset with an upper bound has a least upper bound) I know that $X$ has the intermediate value property because it is connected, but I don't know why it satisfies the least upper bound property.","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'order-theory']"
753652,How is this subgroup normal?,"Let $G$ be a group, and let $U$ be a subset of $G$. Let $\hat{U}$ be the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $U$. Then $\hat{U}$ is the intersection of the collection of all the subgroups of $G$ containing $U$. (Right?) This collection is obviously non-empty as $G$ itself is a subgroup of itself which contains $U$. Now my question is this: If $gug^{-1} \in U$ for all $g \in G$ and $u \in U$, then is the subgroup $\hat{U}$ a normal subgroup of $G$? If the answer is yes, then one way of proving this is to find a homomorphism $ \phi \colon G \to G$ with kernel equal to $\hat{U}$. If the answer is no, then what counter-example can we give?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups']"

We haven't learned differential equations yet, so I wasn't able to follow along the solution of the differential equation. However, doesn't: $v(t) = c/a$ also satisfy the differential equation?
