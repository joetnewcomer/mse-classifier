992900,Measurable Functions as Limits (a.e) of Step Functions,"I saw the following theorem and its proof. Theorem 1: Given a measurable function $f$ on $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, there exists a sequence of simple functions $\{f_k\}$ which converges point-wise to $f$ everywhere . I want to see the proof of the following theorem, following Stein-Shakarchi. Theorem 2: Given a measurable function $f$ on $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, there exists a sequence of step functions $\{f_k\}$ which converges point-wise to $f$ almost everywhere . The proof given by Stein-Shakarchi starts with- it is sufficient to show that any simple function is limit almost everywhere of a sequence of step functions . I don't understand the italic statement.

992928,Which Words Are Part of a Free Basis of $F_n$?,"Start with a free group on $n$ generators, $F=\langle a_1,\ldots, a_n\rangle$. If I write a word, $w$, in these generators, is there an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not $w$ can be extended to a free basis of $F$? I have some comments and partial results, but no efficient algorithm. If any letter appears only once (and raised to the first power), then we can extend the word to a basis (just take the rest of the basis as the other generators). This is not necessary as $c^2bcabab$ can be extended to a basis of $F_3$. If the word is part of a basis, then the projection to the abelianization must be a primitive vector. Another way to say this is that if the vector in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the $i$-th entry equal to the sum of the exponents of $a_i$ in $w$ must not be a $\mathbb{Z}$-multiple of another vector in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. This is not sufficient because $a^2b^2a$ is not part of a basis of $F_2$. Edit:
Given a group $H=\langle w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_k\rangle\leq F_n$, there is an algorithm, due to Stallings, to determine a free basis for $H$. A (terribly inefficient) algorithm is to list all possible bases formed out of reduced words of length less than $w$, and running Stallings' algorithm on each one. I'm asking for an algorithm that can be reasonably implemented.","['geometric-group-theory', 'free-groups', 'group-theory']"
992949,"Non-Banach, completely metrizable normed vector space","Does there exist a normed vector space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ over $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$ such that the metric induced by the norm $(x,y)\mapsto\|x-y\|$ is not complete; but there exists some other metric $d$Â on $X$ that is complete and defines the same topology on $X$ as the norm? It may be possible, since completeness of a metric is not a topological property, but I can't think of an obvious counterexample. In other words: is every completely metrizable (by some metric) normed vector space necessarily a Banach space (i.e., complete also in the norm metric) ?","['vector-spaces', 'general-topology', 'normed-spaces', 'metric-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
992989,"Prove that the linear transformation is injective iff $T(f_1),\ldots,T(f_n)$ are linearly independent","$V$ and $W$ are vector spaces with $dim(V)=n$. Prove that a linear

So, by assumption, for any $r_1,r_2\in V$, $T(r_1)=T(r_2)\rightarrow r_1=r_2$. However, I don't see how I can use this to show that $T(f_1),\ldots,T(f_n)$ are linearly independent. I have to show that only the trivial relation holds in $c_1T(f_1)+\cdots+c_nT(f_n)$ for scalars $c_1,\ldots,c_n$, so $c_1=\cdots=c_n=0$, but how does this following from the transformation being injective alone?",['linear-algebra']

993042,Why is the Stochastic Process in the HJM model non-Markovian?,"I want to understand exactly what my title asks ""Why is the Stochastic Process for the short rate in the HJM model of interest rates non-Markovian?"" That process is the following: $r(t)=F(0,t)+\int^{t}_0 \left[ \sigma(s,t,\Omega_s) \left(\int^{t}_s \sigma(s,\tau,\Omega_s)\ d\tau \right) \right] ds  + \int^{t}_0 \sigma(s,t,\Omega_s)\ dB(s)$ where F(0,t) is deterministic and $\Omega_s$ is a vector of relevant information to determine the volatility $\sigma(s,t,\Omega_s)$.  I believe the reason is because of this $\Omega_s$.  Basically, it seems like since this can be say bond prices from the past, then the non-Markovian follows.  However, I read that even if you essentially ignore this $\Omega_s$ the process will still be non-Markovian.  So I need to know if my first assumption is correct and why then if we ignore that assumption, we still have non-Markov.

993074,Proof of the existence of a partition of unity,"I am trying to understand the proof that partitions of unity on a smooth manifold exist. To this end, I would like to post the proof in my own words here and kindly request that someone read it and tell me if it is correct. Thank you in advance for helping me learn. First I would like to give some definitions. A partition of unity on a $C^\infty$-$n$-manifold $M$ is a collection of smooth functions $\varphi_i : M \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi_i \ge 0$ and for all $m \in M$: $\sum_i \varphi_i(m) = 1$ and for only finitely many $i$: $\varphi_i (m) \neq 0$. We assume that a manifold is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space and we use (without proof) that we can write such a space as a union of sets $G_i$ with the property that $\bigcup_i G_i = M$, $\overline{G_i}$ is compact and $\overline{G_i}\subseteq G_{i+1}$. I will also use that there exists a smooth map $\varphi: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $\varphi$ is $1$ on the open cube of radius $1$ and $0$ outside the closed cube of radius $2$. Now the claim is: If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold and $U_i$ is an open cover of $M$ then there exists a partition of unity with compact support and $\mathrm{supp}(\varphi_i) $ contained in $U_i$. Here is the proof (how I understand it): Let $U_i$ be a given open cover of the smooth manifold $M$. Pick a point $m \in M$. Then $m \in U_i$ for some $i$. Let $(\psi, V)$ be any chart with $m \in V$. Then since scaling of a chart, translation of a chart and restriction of a chart to an open subset of $V$ yields again a chart we may assume that $\psi (m) = 0$ and that $\psi(V)$ contains the closed cube of radius $2$ and that $V \subseteq U_i \cap G_j \setminus \overline{G_{j-1}}$ where $j$ is the largest $j$ such that $m \notin \overline{G_j}$. Let $\widetilde{\varphi}: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ denote that map that is $1$ inside the open cube of radius $1$ centred at $0$ and $0$ outside the cube of radius $2$. Then we define a map $$ \varphi (m) = \begin{cases} 0 & m \notin V \\  \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \psi (m) & m \in V\end{cases}$$ Then it is clear that $\varphi$ is a smooth map $M \to \mathbb R$. Furthermore, since its support is contained in $\overline{V}$ and $\overline{V} \subseteq \overline{G_{j+1}}$ it is clear that the support is compact. For $m \in \overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ let $N_m$ denote an open neighbourhood of $m$ contained in $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ such that $\varphi$. By construction the set $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ is compact.  For $m \in \overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ let $U_m$ denote an open neighbourhood on which the previously constructed map $\varphi$ is $1$. Then since $\overline{G_i} \setminus G_{i-1}$ is compact we may cover it with finitely many such neighbourhoods. We do this for every $i$ so as to obtain a sequence of smooth maps $\varphi_k$. Since the sum $\sum_k \varphi_k$ has only finitely many terms not equal to zero this sum converges at every point in $M$. Hence we may define $$ \varphi_k' = {\varphi_k \over \sum_k \varphi_k'}$$ It is clear that $\varphi_k'$ form a partition of unity for $M$ subordinate to the cover $U_i$.","['proof-verification', 'differential-geometry']"

993236,"Calculating a perpendicular distance to a line, when using coordinates (latitude & longitude)","I'm trying to implement the Douglas-Peucker algorithm for simplifying a recorded GPS track (a list of coordinates).  All implementations I can find assume a simple X/Y grid of squares, however ideally I would like to adapt it to work with Earth coordinates which are not square.

As such, I need to create a function which can calculate the perpendicular distance to the line using latitude and longitude.  Currently the function assumes a a simple X/Y grid. I cannot work out how to adapt the function I have to use something like the Haversine formula for calculating distance between two points, as the existing method doesn't use the perpendicular point. Is is possible to adapt this function to make it more accurate when applied to GPS coordinates?

993798,On the Chern connection,"It is well kown that If $\,\bar\partial_E$ defines a holomorphic structure on the complex vector bundle $E \to X$ and $K$ is a hermitian metric on (the fibres of) $E$, there is a unique connection $D$ on $E$ (the Chern connection ) such that $D$ is metric, i.e. $K$ is parallel with respect to $D$ $D^{0,1} = \bar\partial_E$ A Dolbeault-type operator (i.e. Leibniz' rule holds with respect to $\bar\partial$)
$$
\bar\partial_E \colon A^0_X(E) \to A^{0,1}_X(E)
$$
defines a holomorphic structure on $E$ if and only if satisfies the integrability condition $\,\bar\partial_E^2 = 0$. It seems to me that conditions 1. and 2. make perfectly sense  even if the operator $\,\bar\partial_E$ is not integrable, so I conjectured that the statement above holds true in this more general setting. I thought ""maybe the proof itself does not make any use of the integrability of $\,\bar\partial$"". But every proof I found begins: ""Consider a holomorphic frame..."" and this assumption can be made only if $\,\bar\partial$ actually defines a holomorphic structure, i.e. is integrable. I thus slightly modified the proof in the following way. Does it work? Conjecture: If $\,\bar\partial_E$ is a Dolbeault-type operator on the complex vector bundle $E \to X$ and $K$ is a hermitian metric on (the fibres of) $E$, there is a unique connection $D$ on $E$ such that $D$ is metric, i.e. $K$ is parallel wth respect to $D$ $D^{0,1} = \bar\partial_E$ Proof: The hermitian metric $K$ allows us to reduce the structure group of the bundle to $U(r)$, i.e. we just consider unitary frames. Suppose that such a connection $D$ exists. From the condition 1. we deduce that in any unitary frame we locally have $$
D = \mathrm{d} + A
$$ where $A$ is an antihermitian matrix of $1$-forms, i.e. $A + A^\dagger = 0$. Moreover, condition 2. says that $A^{0,1} = C$ where $C$ is the connection matrix of $\,\bar\partial_E$. These two conditions give the equation $$
A = C - C^\dagger
$$ So $D$ is uniquely determined by $K$ and $\,\bar\partial_E$. To show that $A = C - C^\dagger$ actually defines a connection on $E$ we must check how $A$ changes under gauge transformations $g$. But we know that $C \leadsto gCg^{-1} - \bar\partial g \, g^{-1}$ we can take unitary gauge transformations, i.e. such that $g^{-1} = g^\dagger$ Under such $g$'s we easily see that $$
A = C - C^\dagger \leadsto g A g^{-1} - \mathrm{d}g\,g^{-1}

993854,Conditional expectation proof,"I hope this is the right place to ask my question - my question comes from some reading I'm doing in mathematical finance, but my question is really a question in probability theory, and is about how to prove two conditional expectations are equal. I'm trying to follow the derivation of the conditional expectation result appearing about half way down page 9 of the following paper: http://www.damianobrigo.it/CDS_Counterparty_fitchsolutions.pdf I'm having trouble coming up with a rigorous proof of going from the 3rd to the 4th line, i.e. in showing that, for $u > T_j$
\begin{align}
1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j} &\mathbb{E}[ 1_{\tau_1 > u} | \mathcal{G}_{T_j}, \tau_1 > T_j, T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j ] 
\\
&=1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j} \mathbb{E}[ 1_{\tau_1 > u} | \mathcal{F}_{T_j}, \tau_1 > T_j, T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j ].
\end{align} Notation is explained in the linked paper linked, but I'll try and explain briefly the setup in hope of getting more response. We work on a filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_t, \mathbb{Q}) $. There are $\mathcal{F}_t$ adapted processes, $\lambda_1(t)$ and $\lambda_2(t)$. We define $\Gamma_i(t) = \int_0^t \lambda_i(s) ds$. There are also Uniform random variables $U_1$ and $U_2$, both assumed independent of the filtration $\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = \sigma( \cup_t \mathcal{F}_t )$. $\tau_i$ is defined as $$
\tau_i := \inf \{t: \exp(-\Gamma_i(t)) <= U_i \} $$
and the joint cumulative distribution function of $(U_1, U_2)$ is given by a copula $C(u_1,u_2)$, from which we get dependence of the default times. The filtration $\mathcal{G}_t$ is defined as $$
\mathcal{G}_t : = \sigma ( \mathcal{F}_t, 1_{\tau_1 \leq s_1}, 1_{\tau_2 \leq s_2} : s_1, s_2 \leq t ). $$ My original plan had been the following. The left hand side of the above equation is just a conditional expectation on $\mathcal{G}_{T_j}$. Clearly also the right hand side of the above equation is $\mathcal{G}_{T_j}$ measurable (since we are conditioning on a sub sigma algebra of it). Consequently, if I call the the right hand side random variable of the above equation, R, I just need to show that for any $G \in \mathcal{G}_{T_j}$ $$E(1_G 1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j} 1_{\tau_1 > u} ) = E( 1_G R). $$ To this end, my plan was to show that for any $$
A \in \Pi := \{ X\cap 1_{\tau_1 > s_1} \cap 1_{\tau_2 > s_2} : X \in \mathcal{F_{T_j}}, s_1, s_2 <= T_j \}, $$ $$
\mu_1(A) := \mathbb{E}[ 1_A \mathbb{E}[1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j}  1_{\tau_1 > u} | \mathcal{F}_{T_j}, \tau_1 > T_j, T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j ] ]
$$
and
$$\mu_2(A) := \mathbb{E}[ 1_A 1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j}  1_{\tau_1 > u} ]
$$
are equal. I think this would do it, since then $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are measures agreeing on the $\pi$-system $\Pi$. They therefore must be equal on the sigma algebra generated by $\Pi$, which contains the sigma algebra $\mathcal{G}_{T_j}$, which proves the required conditional expectation property. Unfortunately, I'm not able to prove $\mu_1(A) = \mu_2(A)$...essentially, I seem to need to move the $1_{\tau_2 > s_2}$ term in/out of the conditional expectation conditioned on $\sigma( \mathcal{F}_{T_j}, 1_{\tau_1 > u}, 1_{T_{j-1} < \tau_2 \leq T_j} )$ which I obviously can't do.

994508,"""Wheel Theory"", Extended Reals, Limits, and ""Nullity"": Can DNE limits be made to equal the element ""$0/0$""?","""Wheels"" are a little-known kind of algebraic structure: They modify the concept of a field or a ring in such a way that division by any element is possible, including division by zero, while also avoiding contradictions (such as $2 = 1$) in the algebra. They do this by essentially promoting and generalizing the ""inversion"" operator $x^{-1} = \frac{1}{x}$ to a primary operation, and modifying the distributive laws. Specifically, a wheel is an algebraic structure $(W, +, *, /)$ consisting of a set $W$, two binary operations $+$ and $*$, which are just addition and multiplication, and a third, unary operation $/$, which could be called ""division"" or ""involution"", satisfying: $(W, +)$ and $(W, *)$ are commutative monoids. $/$ is involutive, i.e. for all $a \in W$, $//a = a$. A number of modified distributivity principles: for all $a, b, c \in W$,
$$ac + bc = (a + b)c + 0c$$
$$(a + bc)/b = a/b + c + 0b$$
$$(a + 0b)c = ac + 0b$$
$$/(a + 0b) = /a + 0b$$ $0 * 0 = 0$ Existence of additive annihilator: for all $a \in W$, $0/0 + a = 0/0$. Following the lead of a somewhat eccentric ""computer scientist"" who proposed some stuff along these lines but otherwise was kinda loopy, I call $0/0$ ""nullity"", and denote it $\Phi$. We can then form a wheel from the reals by forming the set $W = \mathbb{R} \cup \{ \infty, \Phi \}$, where we take $/0 = \infty$ and $\Phi = 0/0$. This infinity is unsigned, as in the real projective line. Addition and multiplication are defined similarly, except whenever an operation is ""undefined"", we define it to equal $\Phi$. In particular, we have $\infty + \infty = \Phi$, $0 * \infty = \Phi$, $0^0 = \Phi$, etc. We can define a ""topological wheel"" to be a wheel where the set $W$ has topological structure and the functions $+$, $*$ and $/$ are continuous functions, in a manner analogous to the definitions of topological rings and fields. The topology put on the real wheel above would be like that of the projective line plus an isolated point $\Phi$. This is the inspiration for the term ""wheel"": you can draw this structure on a piece of paper as a circle with a point for $\Phi$ in the center (of course, you can put in anywhere not on the circle, but this is where the term comes from), and that will look like a cart wheel with axle. So in this space, we have that ""undefined"" operations like $\frac{0}{0}$ yield $\Phi$. Yet with limits , we still have that, say, $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ DNE. So my question is: Is it possible to put a topology on this wheel so that all functions have a limit, with those whose limit DNE in the usual topology having limit $\Phi$ and those whose limit exists in the usual topology have that same limit here? If ""no"", what is the largest possible class of functions including all those whose limits exist in the usual topology for which the above can be done? EDIT : Hmmmmmmm... I notice that the ""wheel-shaped"" topology actually doesn't give a topological wheel after all! In particular, the map $x \mapsto x + \infty$ is not continuous in this topology. Note that the preimage of the open set $\{ \Phi \}$ (which is open since $\Phi$ is an isolated point and is actually in fact clopen) pulled back through this map is not $\{ \Phi \}$ but $\{ \infty, \Phi \}$, since $\infty + \infty = \Phi$. Yet this set is not open, but closed, being the union of the closed sets $\{ \infty \}$ and $\{ \Phi \}$ and $\{ \infty \}$ is not a connected component, so it can't be clopen and must be only closed. So this begs another question: is there even any topology on this wheel at all which makes it into a topological wheel and such that real limits are preserved? If so, does such a topology automatically give ""DNE"" (in the projective reals) limits $\Phi$ as a value?","['general-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'limits']"

994781,Geometric vs Arithmetic returns differences,"Been reading some notes that say when calculating returns, using the geometric methodology (1+returns, performing a division between the two returns and - 1 from the result) for computing returns is proven to be mathematically sound over a period of time as compared to arithmetic return computation. Can someone explain why is that so? In addition, for a single day, the arithemtic return should be the same as the geometric return? Many thanks for clearing these doubts. //Added the following clarifications I am currently reading the following paper by morningstar ( http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/EquityPerformanceAttributionMeth.pdf?bcsi_scan_aef1ec8c787364dd=JzQUZczAUPY5RaKpjawEbIdLMXNPAAAAw/PsCg==&bcsi_scan_filename=EquityPerformanceAttributionMeth.pdf ) If you refer to page 11/54, there is a section that talks about the difference between using arithmetic versus geometric methdology. Based on understanding, does it means that geometric return takes into account of the effect of compounding (due to taking into account the current accumulated capital ""1+""r) that makes it mathematically sound over a period of time?","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'statistics', 'linear-algebra', 'time-series']"

994827,Mankiewicz theorem,"I'm looking for a proof of Mankiewicz theorem, which states that: If $U, V$ are open, connected subsets of normed spaces $E, F$ respectively, then every bijective isometry $U \rightarrow V$ extends uniquely to a bijective isometry $E \rightarrow F$. I know it's available in Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci., 20 (1972), 367â371, but it is not available online. Could you help me?","['connectedness', 'functional-analysis']"
994831,Existence of a unique maximizer of a strict quasi-concave function defined over a convex set,"Set $S \subset \mathbb R^2$ is compact and convex. A typical element of $S$ is $s=(s_1,s_2) \in S$. Also, $d \in \mathbb R^2$ is a fixed element such that there exists $s \in S$ such that $s \gt d$. Here  $s \gt d$ means $s_1 \gt d_1$ and $s_2 \gt d_2$
$$\underset{(d_1,d_2)\le(s_1,s_2) \in S}{\overset{}{\operatorname{arg \;\; max}}} \; (s_1-d_1)(s_2-d_2)$$ Let $H(s_1,s_2)=(s_1-d_1)(s_2-d_2)$. Since  $H$ is strictly quasi concave on $\{s \in S: s \gt d \}$, there exists $s \in S$ such that $s \gt d$ and $S$ is convex, so the maximizer of $H$ is unique. My question: I did not get the last part. Why is maximizer of $H$ unique?","['multivariable-calculus', 'convex-analysis', 'calculus', 'self-learning', 'real-analysis']"
994847,Adjacency matrix and connectivity proof,"Let $G$ be graph on $n$ vertices, $A$ its adjacency matrix, and $I_{n}$ the $n\times n$ identity matrix. Prove that $G$ is connected iff the matrix $(I_{n} + A)^{n-1}$ has no 0s. My proof: If the graph is connected the matrix $(I_{n} + A)^{n-1}$ has no 0s. The identity matrix  takes care of the non-zero values for the diagonal (otherwise the diagonals would be 0 since self-loops are disallowed in simple graphs).
If the graph is connected there must exist a path between any two vertices $u,v \in G$. $A^{n-1}_{i,j}$ represents the number of paths of length $n-1$ between any two vertices. If any $A^{n-1}_{i,j}$ would be 0, that would mean that there would not be any path connecting those vertices. Thus, the graph would be disconnected. But we assumed that it was connected If the matrix $(I_{n} + A)^{n-1}$ has no 0s then G is connected If every $(I_{n} + A)^{n-1}$ is non-zero this means that there exists at least one path of length $n - 1$ between any two vertices. If this is the case, the graph must be connected. Is this correct?","['matrices', 'graph-theory', 'proof-verification']"
994859,Proof that every closed subset of $\mathbb R$ is finite or countable or continuum.,I want to prove that every closed subset of $\mathbb R$ is finite or countable or continuum. I know that for arbitrary subset we can not make similar statements - because of continuum hypothesis. It looks like I need some machinery to prove mentioned fact. I feel I need somehow characterize all closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. For open subsets I know that they are union of disjoint intervals. For closed I do not know anything like that. Intution tells me that some deep unknown for me fact should be used here.,"['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'baire-category']"
994861,Existence of Periodic Solution,"I'm working with the system of equations below that represents a Pendulum with constant forcing. 
\begin{align*}
\theta'&=v\\
v'&=-bv-\sin(\theta)+k
\end{align*}
Where $\theta$ gives the angular position, $v$ is the velocity, $b>0$ measures the damping force and $k\geq0$ the applied torque. The question ask, Suppose $k>1$ Prove that there exist a periodic solution for this system. My original idea was to use the PoincarÃ©-Bendixon theorem in our book which says that if $\Omega$ is a closed, and bounded limit set of a planar system of differential equations that contains no equilibrium point. Then $\Omega$ is a closed orbit. If we look at the $v$ nullcline, we can see that the vector field in the region above (say when $v=v_2$) points downwards. Above (say when $v=v_1$) it points upwards. We also know that when $k>1$ there are no longer any equilibrium points. But...this version of the PoincarÃ©-Bendixon theorem is used for planar systems, where I guess in this problem we are working on a cylinder. Is there another way to look at this question, or a different theorem to use. Any help would be great!","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'systems-of-equations']"
