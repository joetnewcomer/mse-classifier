732081,Define curvature and curvature of a circle,"Question:(a) Define the curvature function $\kappa$ of a plane curve. The curvature of $\kappa$ of a plane curve is the amount of turning in the osculating plane. In other words it decribes the speed of rotation. Is how I defined it okay? I feel like I need more or something. Question:(b) Determine the curvature function of the circle $\alpha(t)=(r\cos t,r\sin t)$.
To find our curvature we must find the derivative of $\alpha$; $\alpha'(t)=(-r\sin t, r\cos t)$. Now to find our constant we do the following: $|\alpha'(t)|= \sqrt{r^2\sin^2 t+r^2\cos^2 t}= \sqrt{r^2(\cos^2 t+\sin^2 t)}= \sqrt{r^2}= r.$ Thus, we get the arc-length as, $s= \int_{0}^{t}r dt= rt \bigg |^t_0= rt.$ So, we can write $t= \dfrac{s}{r}$. Using the value of $t$ we substitute it into $\beta$ such that it is a curve parametrized by arc length, $\beta(s)=(r\cos\dfrac{s}{r}, r\sin\dfrac{s}{r}).$ Using this we find the derivative to be, $\beta'(s)=(-\sin\dfrac{s}{r}, \cos\dfrac{s}{r}).$ Looking for our constant we get, $|\beta'(s)|=\sqrt{(-\sin\dfrac{s}{r})^2+\cos^2\dfrac{s}{r}}= \sqrt{1}=1 ,\ \ \ \forall s.$ Finding our second derivative we get, $\beta""(s)=(-\dfrac{1}{r}\cos\dfrac{s}{r}, -\dfrac{1}{r}\sin\dfrac{s}{r}).$ $|\beta""(s)|=\sqrt{(-\dfrac{1}{r}\cos\dfrac{s}{r})^2+ (-\dfrac{1}{r}\sin\dfrac{s}{r})^2}= \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{r^2}}= \dfrac{1}{r}$ Therefore, we see that the curvature $\kappa$ of the circle is a constant,$\dfrac{1}{r}$. Is my work okay? I just want to make sure.",['differential-geometry']

732087,"Is $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} n$ ""equal"" to $\mathbb{N}$?","In set theory, the natural numbers are defined by means of inductive sets and the successor operation $S(n+1) = n \cup \{n\}$ As such, we have $1 = \{0\}$, $2 = \{0, 1\}$, $3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$, etc. Thus, as the natural numbers $n$ get larger and larger, they get closer to approximating the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, which of course, is $\mathbb{N}$. So while this seems a bit under-handed, since limits are really only defined for functions , it seems true in a sense that

732268,An open ultrafilter converges if and only if it has non-empty intersection?,"If $(X,\mathcal T)$ is a topological space then $\mathcal F\subseteq\mathcal T$ is called an open filter on $X$ is (i) $X\in\mathcal F$, $\emptyset\notin\mathcal F$; (ii) $A,B\in\mathcal F$ $\Rightarrow$ $A\cap B\in\mathcal F$; $A\in\mathcal F$, $A\subseteq B\in\mathcal T$ $\Rightarrow$ $B\in\mathcal F$. (The definition of an open filter is similar to the definition of a filter, the only difference is that we are working only with open subsets of $X$.) A maximal open filter is called an open ultrafilter . We can show, using Zorn lemma, that every open filter is contained in an open ultrafilter. In fact, we can show using Zorn lemma that every system of open sets, which has finite intersection property, is contained in an open ultrafilter. If I am not missing something, then we can show that for an open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ we have $\bigcap \mathcal F\ne\emptyset$ if and only if $\mathcal F$ converges. Let us denote by $\mathcal N_x$ the system of all neighborhoods of $X$. Suppose that $x\in\bigcap \mathcal F$. Clearly the system $\mathcal N_x\cup\mathcal F$ than has finite intersection property. (Any set from this system contains $x$.) Maximality of $\mathcal F$ then implies $\mathcal N_x\subseteq\mathcal F$, which means that $\mathcal F$ converges to $x$. On the other hand, if $\mathcal F$ converges, then there exists a point $x\in X$ such that $\mathcal N_x\subseteq\mathcal F$. This clearly implies $x\in\bigcap\mathcal F$. EDIT: As the counterexample posted in the answer shows, this is a place where my argument contained a mistake. In this way I can only show: An open ultrafilter converges if and only if it has a cluster point. (Or: An open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ converges to $x$ if and only if $x$ is a cluster point of $\mathcal F$.) The reason I have some doubts about this that I have seen mentioned in some papers that an open ultrafilter converges if and only if it has a cluster point. 1 I thought that it would be quite logical to mention also the observation that it converges if and only if it has a non-empty intersection. 1 For example: C. Liu: Absolutely Closed Spaces; Transactions of the American Mathematical Society Vol. 130, No. 1 (Jan., 1968), pp. 86-104 AMS , JSTOR . EDIT 2: My original claim is not true for Hausdorff spaces, either. It suffices to take any H-closed space (for example, any compact Hausdorff space) and choose any system of open subsets of $X$, which has finite intersection property, but has empty intersection. Using Zorn Lemma we can show that there is an open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ containing this system. For this open ultrafilter we have $\bigcap \mathcal F = \emptyset$. But, since we are working in a H-closed space, the open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ converges. (A Hausdorff space $X$ is called H-closed if or absolutely closed if it is closed in any Hausdorff space, which contains $X$ as a subspace. It is known that a Hausdorff space is H-closed if and only if every open ultrafilter on $X$ converges. 2 ) More concrete example was given in Daniel Fischer's comment below. 2 See, for example, Berri, M. P. ; Porter, J. R. ; Stephenson, R. M., Jr.

Denote $X=(0,1)$. We know that for a compact and metrizable space $Y$, the group $\mathrm{Homeo}(Y)$ is Polish. We tried to apply a similar proof to the case of $X$. The problem starts with separability. $\mathrm{Homeo}(Y)$ inherits its separability from $C(Y,Y)$ (the space of all continuous function).

To prove this, I tried the following. Consider the numbers 1 through 15 laid out next to each other in a row, starting with the number 1 and ending with 15. To find the subsets that obbey the given restrictions, we start of by picking some number $a_1 \geq 1$.

732630,On the bidegree of a curve in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$,"I was reading Beauville's Complex algebraic surfaces, at page 5 there is an example in which curves in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ are classified by the bidegree up to linear equivalence. I'm happy with that, and it makes sense that the defining polynomial determines the linear equivalence class of the curve. However, the bidegree is also the degree of the morphism defined by the projections to the lines $\lbrace 0 \rbrace \times \mathbb{P}^1$ and $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \lbrace 0 \rbrace$ . Thence, I was wondering if the bidegree of the curve also gives some contraints on the other possible morphisms from the curve to the two lines above. I heard somewhere that the degree of the curve is somehow related to its gonality, for instance, is there such a relation?

732679,How to rotate a matrix by 45 degrees?,"Assume you have a 2D matrix. Ignore the blue squares.
The first image represents the initial matrix and the second represents the matrix rotated by 45 degrees. For example, let's consider a random cell from the first image.

Let x be the row and y be the column, so x = 3 and y = 2. The formula of this rotation is : RM[x + y - 1][n - x + y] = M[x][y], where RM means rotated matrix, M the initial matrix, and n the dimension of the initial matrix (which is n x n).

Even better, is there a more general result that this is a special case of? I'm curious because it looks like a simple vector calculus formula that should be easy to prove without calculation, and the links between determinants, cross products and volume make me think that there should be some kind of more general version.

Hence, it is useful to be able to determine whether or not a given ideal $I\subset k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is prime. Suppose I can explicitly write down all of the equations defining $X$, that is $X=Z(f_1,\ldots,f_m)=Z(J)$, so that $I(X)=\sqrt J$.  I'm interested in learning different techniques for determining if $I(X)$ is prime, or equivalently, if $X$ is irreducible.  I'm also interested in different sufficient conditions on the $f_i$ which imply that $I(X)$ is prime, so that the problem is reduced to checking something about the $f_i$.  If possible, references to the literature would be great.  Here are some first techniques of which I'm already aware: Show that if $ab\in I$, then either $a\in I$ or $b\in I$.  This is just the definition of a prime ideal, but perhaps we can reduce the list of pairs $(a,b)$ we must check to some finite list involving the $f_i$ and their divisors. Use a computer algebra system such as Magma or GAP.  This is troublesome as $m$ and $n$ grow. Construct a surjective morphism of varieties $\varphi:Y\to X$ such that $Y$ is irreducible.

My question concerns theorems of the opposite kind: What are some good theorems that can be used to show that $X$ decays slowly ?

733411,A modified NIM game,"Let's play a game of NIM, but with a catch! We have exactly three piles of stones with sizes $a$, $b$ and $c$, all of which are different. We move in turns. In every move, we can select a pile and remove any number of stones from it. But there's a restriction: At no point during the game can we have two equally high piles of non-zero size. The player who cannot make a move loses. the game $(1, 3, 5)$ can be transformed into $(0, 3, 5)$, $(1, 2, 5)$, $(1, 0, 5)$, $(1, 3, 4)$, $(1, 3, 2)$  or $(1, 3, 0)$ in one move $(0, 1, 2)$ can be transformed into $(0, 0, 2)$ or $(0, 1, 0)$ the game $(0, 0, 0)$ is an immediate loss I happen to know a way to compute the outcome of such a game: Unless $a = b = c = 0$, the first player loses exactly if $(a+1) \oplus (b+1) \oplus (c+1) = 0$. $(0,0,0)$ is a loss too. I think it can be proven via induction on $a + b + c$. What I don't know is how one would derive that result. I have puzzled over this quite some time and figured out a formula for the case with two piles, but could not generalize it. Then I looked up the solution. How would you approach this problem to get an intuition on what the winning or losing positions are? Or even better, is there some general method that often works for these types of games? I know about the Sprague-Grundy theorem and P and N positions in general games on DAGs, so I can just use ""brute force"" to solve the problem, but unfortunately the numbers were too large to solve the problem that way and the results for smallish $a,b,c$ didn't really help me derive the formula. One important observation I can draw from this in hindsight however is that the value $(a+1) \oplus (b+1) \oplus (c+1)$ does not seem to be the grundy number of the game, they just happen to be zero for the same assignments of $a$, $b$ and $c$. The source of the problem is the Andrew Stankevich Programming Contest 22 , task D. UPDATE: For the two pile case, exactly the positions $(2k, 2k - 1)$ are the losses. We can get from every other position to one of these or to $(0, 0)$, but we can't get from one of these into another of these. The base case is that $(1, 2)$ is a loss and $(0, a)$ is a win for $a > 0$.","['game-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

First fundamental form: $E = X_{u} • X_{u} = v^{2} + c^{2},$ $F = X_{u} • X_{v} = 0$ , $G = X_{v} • X_{v} = 1$ . Information that follows swiftly from it: $X_{uu} = (-v \cos u, - v \sin u, 0)$ $X_{uv} = (-\sin u, \cos u, 0)$ , $X_{vv} = (0,0,0)$ . $N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(EG-F^2)}}\cdot(-c \sin u, c \cos u, -v).$ Second Fundamental Form: $e = \langle N, X_{uu}\rangle = \frac{2c v \sin u\cos u}{\sqrt{EG-F^2}},$ $f = \langle N, X_{uv}\rangle = \frac{c \sin^2 u - c \cos^2 u}{\sqrt{EG-F^2}},$ $g =\langle N, X_{vv}\rangle = 0.$ These can be simplified somewhat. Asymptotic curves must satisfy: $e(u')^{2} - 2f u' v' + g (v')^{2} = 0.$ I can plug these values in, but cannot really proceed.

I would guess that this can be extended to counting points on any algebraic curve over $\mathbb{F}_q$ once the RH has been proven for curves. But is there anything further one can do with this generalization? Is it worth trying to dive deeper into the curve case, or just appreciate the elliptic curve case before trying to head to higher dimensional varieties?

733643,Passive and active coordinate transformation on a topological manifold.,"Let us suppose we have $m$-dimensional smooth topological manifold $M$. Let $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be two charts on the manifold and $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$. For a point $p \in U \cap V$, we then have two coordinate systems:
\begin{equation}
\varphi: U \to \mathbb{R}^m \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \psi: V \to \mathbb{R}^m
\end{equation}
Thus, we can change coordinate by using the transition map $\varphi \circ \psi^{-1}$. This is considered to be a passive coordinate transformation. On the other hand, we can use a diffeomorphism, $\phi : M \to M$, to change the manifold itself, which will result in a new coordinate system. This is considered to be an active coordinate transformation. Now, in my physics courses I've always learnt that active and passive transformations are exactly the same, and it is just a matter of convention which one we choose. However, the above seems to suggest that it is always possible to change coordinate via an active transformation, whereas it is only possible to make a passive coordinate transformation if at least two open sets overlap each other. Is this true? Or is is it also possible to somehow make an passive coordinate transformation if the open sets do not overlap. I guess, a different phrasing of this question would be: For any chart $(U,\varphi)$, are we allowed to change the homeomorphic map $\varphi$ to another map in order to get a different coordinate system? I.e. is the map $\varphi$ corresponding to $U$ unique, or can we associate multiple maps with $U$? I've tried to reason that we are in fact able to always choose a different map, but I'm not sure and none of the books I own mention this explicitly.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

 There are a lot of definitions here which can be found in the reference material, but they should not be needed. We also have
$$p(\Gamma)=\frac1Z \exp(\delta\sum_{j=1}^N \cos(\gamma_j))$$
Where $Z=\int_{(S^2)^N} \exp(\delta\sum_{j=1}^N \cos(\gamma_j))dS$ and $\Gamma=\{\gamma_i\}$.
Therefore
$$\langle\sin(\gamma_i)\rangle=$$
$$ \frac1Z \int_0^{2\pi} \cdots\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \cdots\int_0^{\pi} \sin(\gamma_i)\exp(\delta\sum_{j=1}^N \cos(\gamma_j))\sin(\gamma_1)d\gamma_1 \cdots \sin(\gamma_N)d\gamma_N d\phi_1\cdots d\phi_N$$ $$=\frac{(4\pi)^N}{Z} \prod_{j=1}^N \int_0^\pi \sin(\gamma_i) \sin(\gamma_j) \exp(\delta\cos( \gamma_j)) d\gamma_j$$ Now $$Z=(4\pi)^N \prod_{j=1}^N \int_0^\pi \sin(\gamma_j) \exp(\delta \cos(\gamma_j)) d\gamma_j$$
Therefore
$$\langle\sin(\gamma_i)\rangle=\frac{\int_0^\pi \sin^2(\gamma_i) \exp(\delta\cos( \gamma_i)) d\gamma_i}{\int_0^\pi \sin(\gamma_i) \exp(\delta \cos(\gamma_i)) d\gamma_i}\neq0

( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0%5Epi+sin%28x%29%5E2+e%5E%28cos%28x%29%29+dx ) I can't for the life of me see what's going wrong here, any help would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: With reference to the pdf file, here is the proof as to why I know this integral must be zero, On page 10 there is the proof of: $w_n=ww_{n-1}$ $w_n=\langle \vec{t}_i \cdot \vec{t}_{i+n}\rangle=\langle \cos(\gamma_i+...+γ_{i+n-1})\rangle$ We then expand the cos term into:
$w_n=\langle \cos(γ_i)\rangle \langle\ \cos(\gamma_{i+1}+...+γ_{i+n-1})\rangle-\langle \sin(γ_i)\rangle \langle \sin(\gamma_{i+1}+...+γ_{i+n-1})\rangle$ $\Rightarrow w_n=ww_{n-1}+\langle \sin(γ_i)\rangle \langle\cdots\rangle$ $\Rightarrow \langle \sin(γ_i)\rangle=0$","['statistics', 'integration', 'mathematical-modeling', 'biology']"

733817,Confusion regarding one formulation of the Axiom of Choice.,"One formulation of the Axiom of Choice is: The Cartesian product of non-empty sets is always non-empty. Cartesian product is defined as making ""every possible pair"" between elements of two sets. The implication is that through some aritrarily selected algorithm, we can select each element one-by-one, and pair it with another element (from another set). Does the Axiom of Choice imply that without assuming such an axiom, no such algorithm can exist? What if the elements are ordered? If I have a linearly ordered set, and I state that I my method of selection of elements is I will move from the lowest element to the highest element, am I still using the Axiom of Choice somehow? Is choosing even the lowest element in a set an exercise of the Axiom of Choice? Thanks","['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

733902,"The ""intersection property"" of the symmetric difference metric","$\newcommand{\measure}{\operatorname{measure}}$ The symmetric difference between sets can be used to define a pseudo-metric on the set of subsets of a given measure space: $$d(S,T)=\measure(S\oplus T)$$ This pseudometric has the following property, that can be called ""Intersection Property"": If $S$ intersects $T$, then there is a constant $r>0$ such that
every set $S'$ with $d(S',S)<r$ intersects every set $T'$ with $d(T',T)<r$ [where ""$S$ intersects $T$"" means: $d(S\cap T, \phi)>0$]. Proof: Define $r = d(S\cap T, \phi)/3 = \measure(S\cap T)/3$. By assumption $r>0$. The set $S\cap T$ can be decomposed as follows: $$S\cap T = $$
$$[(S\setminus S')\cap(T\setminus T')] \cup $$
$$[(S\cap S')\cap(T\setminus T')] \cup $$
$$[(S\setminus S')\cap(T\cap T')] \cup $$
$$[(S\cap S')\cap(T\cap T')]$$ By definition, $S\oplus S' = (S\setminus S')\cup (S'\setminus S)$. Hence: $$\measure(S\setminus S')\leq \measure(S\oplus S') < r$$ Simlarly: $$\measure(T\setminus T')\leq \measure(T\oplus T') < r$$ Substituting in the decomposition of $S\cap T = $ gives: $$\measure[(S\cap S')\cap(T\cap T')] > \measure[S\cap T] - 3r > 0$$ This implies that $S$ intersects $S'$ and $T$ intersects $T'$. My questions are: A. Is this proof correct? B. Is there a formal term for this property of pseudo-metrics, which I called ""intersection property""? NOTE: This property is not true for all pseudo-metrics. For example, it is not true for the pseudo-metric based on the Hausdorff distance .","['measure-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'terminology', 'proof-verification']"
