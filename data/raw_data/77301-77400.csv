980701,"Is the book ""Naive Set Theory"" authored by P. R. Halmos still up-to-date?","My question is whether Halmos' book ""Naive Set Theory"" is still up-to-date concerning contemporary mathematics; that is, is it outdated or not? I really love the book so far, and while it's clear the notation is outdated, so far nothing contradicts what we had in the lectures. My assistant in calculus warned me about the book not being the newest though, so I'm a little confused right now. Can I safely continue reading it without learning anything wrong or should I look for another book? If the latter is the case, can anyone of you give me a suggestion which book would be better suited? Thanks in advance! Sincerely,

980728,Proving convergence of $ \int \limits_0^{\infty} \cos\left(x^2\right) dx $,"How would one prove the convergence of $$ \int_0^{\infty} \cos\left(x^2\right) \,\mathrm dx $$ I tried using the integral test for convergence by noting that making the substitution $u = x^2$ means you can write the integral in the form: $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}\cos(u) \space \mathrm{du}$$ I'm not sure what to do here - I though of rewriting the cosine as a Taylor series, and then applying the integral test, but I don't think that would work.","['definite-integrals', 'integration']"
980743,Calculate the flux of $\underline{v}$ across the boundary of the sector.,"For $a\in(0,1)$ , calculate without use of the divergence theorem the flux of $\underline{v}(x,y) = g(y/x)(-1/x,1/y)$ across the boundary of the sector $ S_a := \{(x,y)\in \Omega : 1\leqslant x^2+y^2 \leqslant 4, a\leqslant y/x\leqslant 1/a \} $ where $\Omega:=\{(x,y): x>0, y>0\} $ . Initial progress: I've drawn out what I think $S_a$ looks like and it's a sector of an annulus in the upper right quadrant of the $x,y$ plane. I've worked out the flux across each of the straight sides of the boundary and got $(a+1/a)g(1/a)ln(2)$ and $-(a+1/a)g(a)ln(2)$ for the other. The issue I'm having is with the two curved sides of the boundary because I'm unsure how to parametrise them. Is the work I've done so far correct? And how would I finish it off? New progress: So I used that parametrisation and worked out the flux across both of the curved sides of the boundary to be $0$ . Is this correct? Does this mean the answer is $Flux= (a+1/a)ln(2)(g(1/a)-g(a))$ ?","['analytic-geometry', 'vector-analysis', 'analysis']"

Let $C$ be the semicircle with radius R above the real axis and $\gamma$ be the semicircle under the real axis with radius $\varepsilon$, both centered at $O$. Let $L$ be the closed contour contained $C,[-R,-\varepsilon],\gamma,[\varepsilon,R]$. Denote the $+$ direction by the $+$ direction of $L$. Then we have: $$\int_{L^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz=I(R,\varepsilon)+\int_{C^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz+\int_{\gamma^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz$$ By Cauchy Integral Formula we have $\int_{L^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz=2\pi i$ so $$I(R,\varepsilon)=2\pi i-\int_{C^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz-\int_{\gamma^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz$$ Take $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ we have: $$I(R,0)=\pi i-\int_{C^+}\frac{e^{iz}}{z}dz=\pi i-\int_0^{\pi}\frac{e^{iRe^{i\phi}}}{Re^{i\phi}}iRe^{i\phi}d\phi$$ $$=\pi i-i\int_0^\pi\exp(iR(\cos\phi+i\sin\phi))d\phi=\pi i-i\int_0^\pi e^{iR\cos\phi}e^{-R\sin\phi}d\phi$$ Now I must take the limit $R\rightarrow\infty$. I evaluate: $$\left|\int_0^\pi e^{iR\cos\phi}e^{-R\sin\phi}d\phi\right|\le\int_0^\pi e^{-R\sin\phi}d\phi$$ Is there anything wrong in my argument so far? How can I proceed further?

981059,Basic question: Condition for a map associated to a linear series to be an immersion,"I am reading this set of lectures of a class by Prof. Harris. There is a theorem. Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and $\phi:X\rightarrow\mathbb{P^r}$ be the map defined by a linear series without base point. Then $\phi$ is an embedding iff the following is satisfied: (a) For all pairs $p,q\in X$ the subspace $V(-p-q)$ of sections vanishing at both $p,q$ has dimension dim$V-2$, and (b) $V(-2p)$ is properly contained in $V(-p)$ for each $p\in X$. I can see that condition (a) implies set-theoretical injectivity. The lecture says (b) is to ensure $\phi$ is an immersion because then at each point $p$ there is a function in $V$ that vanishes at $p$, but does not vanish to order two. But I'm not satisfied because I can't write this argument down in detail. How does one prove surjectivity on the level of stalk given condition (b), so that $\phi$ is an immersion. Thank you very much. For a general, say, normal variety $X$, does a linear system with condition (b) define a map $\phi$ which is an immersion ($p$ replaced by a divisor in the system)?

981084,"Question on how to get back ""classical"" Serre-duality from its derived functor formulation","I'm really new to derived categories, so i hope this isn't a stupid question. I'm trying to understand how the duality described as for example in Residues and Duality of R. Hartshorne, using the language of derived categories, gives back the ""classical"" Serre-duality $$\mathrm{Ext}^{n-i}(\mathcal{F},\omega _X)\cong H^{i}(X,\mathcal{F})^{\vee}$$ which i know from algebraic geometry if $X$ is a smooth variety of dimension $n$ over a field $k$, $f:X\rightarrow\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ its structure morphism, $\omega _X$ its canonical bundle and $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent sheaf on $X$ (and $(-)^{\vee}$ is denoting the dual). This brought me to this question and further to the text Derived categories of sheaves: a skimming recommended there, which really helped me a lot, but there is still one point i don't see (on page 16 of this text) -- in the above notation: Why is it that $$\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(\mathbf{R}f_{\ast}\mathcal{F}[i],k)\cong H^{i}(X,\mathcal{F})^{\vee}$$ where $\mathcal{F}[i]$ is the complex consisting only of $\mathcal{F}$ at the $(-i)$'th place (and $0$ everywhere else)? (Obviously $f_{\ast}$ is the global-sections functor in this case, so the statement definitely seems reasonable -- but unfortunately i just don't see how to prove it.) $\mathrm{Hom}_k$ here shall correspond to the $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{pt}}$ of the text referred to above. EDIT: I feel that my first guess on what is actually meant by $\mathrm{Hom}_k$ (resp. $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{pt}}$) was wrong -- it now seems to me as if it is supposed to denote $\mathrm{Hom}_{D(k)}$ where $D(k)$ shall denote the ""derived category of coherent sheaves on $\mathrm{Spec} (k)$"". So the left hand side of the above were maps of complexes of $k$ vector spaces, corresponding -- if we were without loss of generality allowed to consider everything as living in the derived category of quasicoherent (instead of coherent) sheaves, with enough injectives -- to maps $f_{\ast}\mathcal{I}^{i}\rightarrow k$ if $\mathcal{I}^{\bullet}$ is an injective resolution of $\mathcal{F}$, and such a map again of course induced a map on cohomologies, $H^{i}(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow k$ ... In case this works up to here, why would this be reversible, yielding the desired isomorphism (as i still don't see why $\mathbf{R}f_{\ast}\mathcal{F}[i]$ would be concentrated in a single degree)?

981542,Covering finite groups by unions of proper subgroups,"A noncyclic finite group $G$ may be expressed as a union of some of its proper subgroups. (Say the subgroups ""cover"" $G$ in this case.) A relatively simple exercise in some introductory algebra texts, e.g. Jacobson [Basic Algebra I, 2ed p 36 ex 14 ], is to show that no group is the union of two proper subgroups. So I thought what if one is allowed more proper subgroups? One cannot express a cyclic group as a union of proper subgroups, since one of the subgroups would containing the generator and hence fail to be proper. On the other hand, if $G$ is noncyclic it has such an expression, since one can form all the cyclic groups generated by the elements of $G$, and then their union is $G$ and each is proper since $G$ is not cyclic. My question is about the minimal number of proper subgroups needed to cover a given noncyclic group $G.$ If this minimal number is denoted $m(G)$ then I found e.g. $m(S_3)=4$ and also $m(K)=3$ for the symmetric group $S_3$ and the Klein four-group $K.$
I would be interested if anything is known about $m(S_n)$ generally, or in what $m(G)$ turns out to be for other families of groups. (Even some more examples of $m(S_n)$ for small $n$ would be nice.) Another interesting case might be for the multiplicative groups of invertible elements mod $n$ (in cases where no primitive root exists.)",['group-theory']

Suppose we measure $S$, the distance along the ellipse from the $\theta=0$ point, where $r$ is minimal. The metric gives small changes of S with respect to $\theta$: $$dS^2=dr^2+r^2d\theta^2$$ which leads to $$dS=\sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2}d\theta.$$ and finally to $$dS=\frac{\sqrt{a^2+2 a\cos\theta+1}}{(a+\cos\theta)^2}d\theta.$$ Integrating we get $$S(\theta)=\int_0^\theta \frac{\sqrt{a^2+2 a\cos{u}+1}}{(a+\cos{u})^2}du=F(\theta)$$ Now we have to generate a set $\{s_i\}$ of uniformly distributed numbers over $[0,1)$ and solve $$Ls_i=F(\theta_i)$$ where $L$ is the total length aroung the ellipse.

Further, we know that $\lim_{f(x) \to 0}g(f(x))=L $. $f(x)$ is a well behaving, continuous function; $g(y)$ is similar, only it is just not defined at $y=f(x)=0$. I wonder that if it is possible to show that it is $\lim_{x \to 0}g(f(x))  = L$. I don't know exactly whether it is even possible to evaluate a limit with a dependent ($f(x)$ here, with $\lim_{f(x) \to 0}g(f(x))=L$) variable, but it looks like so intuitive that I thought it can be shown in a rigorous way. Here is what I have tried so far: First, we fix $\epsilon > 0$; we know that there is a $\delta$ such that it is $|g(f(x))-L| < \epsilon$, whenever $0<|f(x)|<\delta$. We pick such a $\delta$. Now I must be able to show that for that $\delta$, there are $x$ values such that $0 < |x| < \delta' \implies 0<|f(x)| <\delta$ . Since we know $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)=0$, due to the definition of this limit, such a $\delta'$ always exists. Is my proof valid? If not, how this problem can be proven or disproven?

Even ""obvious"" things seem difficult to prove rigorously, for example, that the lines intersect each other at $60^\circ$ angles.

First, I know that convergence in measure of a sequence of functions $f_n$ is different than convergence a.e., wich means there are sequences that converge in measure but not a.e. but this excercise got me in doubt if there is some kind of duality between convergence in measure and convergence a.e. Excercise : Let $f, f_n \in L_1$, and suppose that $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e. Show that $||f_n -f||_1 \rightarrow 0$ if and only if $||f_n||_1 \rightarrow ||f||_1$ (Note that this result also hold if ""a.e."" is replaced by ""in measure"") My attempt at Proof : $\big($$\Leftarrow$  : If $||f_n||_1 \rightarrow ||f||_1$ and $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e. then, 
$$\lim\int |f_n -f| \leq \lim \int |f_n| + |f| = 2\int|f|$$ Now applying Fatou's Lemma: $$0 = \int \lim|f_n - f| = \int \underline{\lim}|f_n - f| \leq \underline{\lim}\int  |f_n - f|$$ $$\leq \overline{lim} \int |f_n - f| \leq \int \overline{\lim}|f_n - f| = 0$$ $\big($$\Rightarrow$ : $$0 \leq \lim \int ||f_n| - |f|| \leq \lim\int |f_n - f| \leq \int \lim |f_n - f|= 0$$
Wich completes the proof for $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e. Now, and this part I'm not that sure, if $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure, suppose $\lim \int |f_n - f| \neq 0$, that is there is some $\delta > 0$ and a subsequence $f_{n_k}$ such that $\lim \int |f_{n_k} - f| \geq \delta$. But we know that every sequence wich converges in measure to some $f$ has a subsequence that converges a.e., in this case there exists a sub-subsequences $f_{n_{k_j}} \rightarrow f$ a.e. But now $0 = \lim \int |f_{n_{k_j}} - f| \geq \delta$ wich is a contradiction. The question is: Can we generalize the process above? For example is P is property on $f_n$ a sequence of functions, can we assure that a result will hold if we replace ""a.e."" by ""in measure"" in general? Can you provide a counter-example to 2)? If $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure and P is valid for $f_n$, then if  $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e. it would mean $f_n \rightarrow f$ in measure too so P would still be valid. But if $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e. and P is valid for the sequence, can we arrive that is valid if we replace convergence a.e. by convergence in measure?","['examples-counterexamples', 'integration', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral']"

982263,Solving the ODE $(x^2 - 1) y''- 2xy' + 2y = (x^2 - 1)^2$,"I want to solve this ODE: $$(x^2 - 1)y'' - 2xy' + 2y = (x^2 - 1)^2.$$ I found out that $y_1 = x$ and $y_2 = x^2+1$ are solutions of the associated  homogeneous equation, $x$ by inspecting, and $x^2+1$ by multiplying $x$ by a function and solving. Now, I know that a particular solution of the problem is given by $y_p = k_1x + k_2(x^2+1)$, for some functions $k_1,k_2$, which must satisfy the following relations: $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} k_1'x + k_2'(x²+1) = 0 \\k_1' + k_2'(2x) = (x^2-1)^2 \end{array}\right.$$
From the second equation, I have that $k_1' = (x^2-1)^2 - 2xk_2'$, and in the first equation we get that: $$ x(x^2-1)^2 - 2x^2k_2' + (x^2+1)k_2' = 0 \implies (-x^2+1)k_2' = -x(x^2-1)^2$$
and so $k_2' = x(x^2-1) = x³ - x$. Back in the second equation, we obtain: $$k_1' = (x^2-1)^2 - 2x^2(x^2-1) \implies k_1' = (x^2-1)(-x²-1) = -x⁴ + 1.$$ By simple integration, we get $k_1 = -\frac{x^5}{5}+x$ and $k_2 = \frac{x^4}{4} - \frac{x^2}{2}$. By this calculation, the particular solution would be: $$y_p =-\frac{x^6}{5} + x^2 + \frac{x^6}{4} -\frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4} - \frac{x^2}{2} \\ \implies y_p = \frac{x^6}{20} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \frac{x^2}{2}.$$ Differentiating, we get $y_p' = \frac{3x^5}{10} - x^3 + x$ and $y_p'' = \frac{3x^4}{2} - 3x^2 + 1$. Notice that the only constant term on the left side will be a lonely $-1$. But this can't be right, since it'll have to appear a $+1$ term on the right side, to match the $+1$ in $x^4-2x^2 + 1$ on the right side. I don't have a single clue of why this isn't working.

982899,Evaluating $\int_0^1 \frac{t^{a-1}}{1-t}-\frac{ct^{b-1}}{1-t^c}\ dt$,At first sight it looks like the integral below $$\int_0^1 \frac{t^{a-1}}{1-t}-\frac{ct^{b-1}}{1-t^c}\ dt$$ can be evaluated by using some geometric series. What else can we do? Is there a fast easy way to finish it?,"['improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis']"
982902,Number of $K_{10}$ always increases,"Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $n\geq 10 $ vertices. Suppose that when we add any edge to $G$, the number of complete graphs $K_{10}$ in $G$ increases. Show that $|E|\geq 8n-36$. [Source: The probabilistic method, Alon and Spencer 3rd ed., p.12, problem 5] For the base case $n=10$, we know $G$ must have $44=8\cdot 10-36$ edges. We know every vertex in $G$ must have degree $\geq 8$; otherwise adding an edge connecting that vertex cannot increase the number of $K_{10}$. This gives $|E|\geq 4n$.","['graph-theory', 'probabilistic-method', 'combinatorics']"
982928,"Venn- Diagrams, Probability","I want to know how to draw a Venn Diagram with the given information below.. There are 30 students: 16 are girls; There are 7 girls and 6 boys who have blue eyes. A student is randomly chosen to be class monitor. Draw a Venn Diagram to represent this information. Progress I thought a possible answer would be 2 separate circles, one for boys and one for girls. Each one of the circles would have a smaller circle inside, with the total of each with blue eyes. For example, the girl's would have 8 in the large circle and 6 in the smaller circle situated inside of the larger one. And for the boys, there would be 9 in the large and 7 in the smaller circle. According to some, it wouldn't qualify as a Venn-Diagram, so I don't know if it's correct.","['elementary-set-theory', 'probability']"
982981,Cardinality for Kleene star and infinite Cartesian products.,"Let $X$ be a finite set with at least 2 elements. Then the set of all finite-length ""strings"", $$X^* = \bigcup_{L \in \mathbb{Z}^+} \prod_{i=1}^L X_i = \{ (x_1, \ldots, x_L) : L \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \text{and } x_i \in X\}$$ is countably infinite.  If we make the strings infinitely long through a series of Cartesian products: $$X^{\mathbb{N}} = \prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} X_i = \{ (x_1, \ldots): x_i \in X \}$$ then the resulting Carteisan product is uncountable and equal in cardinality to the real numbers. When $X$ is countably infinite, I know from this question that $X^\mathbb{N}$ is still equal in cardinality to the real numbers, but I'm not sure about $X^*$. What is the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}^*$? The next obvious question is what happens when $X$ is uncountably infinite and equal in cardinality to the real numbers. It will certainly be uncountable, but I want to know how it compares to the cardinality of the reals. What are the cardinalities of $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$?","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
982984,Prove that an equation has no elementary solution,"There are methods proving that a polynomial isn't solvable in radical extensions (see Abel–Ruffini theorem) or proving that an integral or a differential equation has no solutions expressible through elementary functions (Risch Algorithm and differential Galois theory). But I've never seen a proof that proves an equation (like $xe^x=1$) not be solvable in terms of elementary functions. Is there a mathematical theory on that? Is there a proof that the solutions of $xe^x=1$ cannot be expressed using basic arithmetic, trig, exponentials, logarithms and a composition of them?","['closed-form', 'abstract-algebra', 'elementary-functions']"
