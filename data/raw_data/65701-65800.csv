772942,Double integral of a piecewise function over a rectangle?,"Let $f$ be defined on the rectangle $R=[1,2] \times [2,4]$ as follows: $$ f(x,y) = \begin{cases} (x+y)^{-2}, & \text{if }x\leq y \leq 2x;
> \\\\ 0, & \text{otherwise. } \end{cases} $$ Compute the value of the double integral $\int\int_Rf$. I think since $f=0$ in the second case, I should just ignore it. However, what confuses me is the condition in the first case. The interval of $y$ is not $[x,2x]$ for all values of $x$. Since $2\leq y \leq 4$, this condition implies that $x=2$ for this interval. But does that mean I ignore $x\in [1,2)$? I'm just not sure how to begin this problem.",['multivariable-calculus']
773042,How to define the magnitude of a rotation in $\mathbb{R}^n$?,"Is there some well established way on how to quantify rotations in $\mathbb{R}^n$? To say which rotation is greater and which is smaller? In $\mathbb{R}^2$ the rotation is characterized by a single angle. This angle can be interpreted as the magnitude of the rotation. In $\mathbb{R}^3$ however we have three possible axes around which to rotate. Furthermore we can get a zero rotation by rotating around each axis by $\pi$ radians. Therefore devices such as the sum of the three angles do not make sense. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the situation is even more complicated. Let's say that the rotation is characterized by matrix $R$. Is the distance of $R$ from the identity matrix $I$ of the appropriate dimension a reasonable choice? For example 
$$
m_{R} = || R - I|| 
$$ 
where $||.||$ is some matrix norm. If so, which norm would be appropriate?","['geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'definition']"
773049,The Last Man Standing,"This is my second question following this post . Three players are playing a game. They all have small amounts of
  money, let say: player 1 has $\$a$, player 2 has $\$b$, and player 3
  has $\$c$, where $a<b<c$. The probability of each player wins each
  turn of the game is $p$ for player 1, $q$ for player 2, $r$ for player
  3, and $s$ for having draw, where $p+q+r+s=1$. The losers will transfer a dollar ($\$1$) to the winner for each turn. The game ends until one
  player has all the money. What is the probability of each player going
  bankrupt? What is the expected number of turns so that only one player
  left as the winner? Suppose that they play blackjack, if player 1 gets 20 points, player 2 gets 19 points, and player 3 gets 18 points, then the winner of that turn is player 1, so the other two players must pay a dollar to the player 1. If there are two players get, for example, 19 points and the another player gets 18 points, then that turn is considered draw. If they all get 19 points, this is also considered draw. If one player loses all the money, then he will stop playing and only two player will continue the game with probability of winning for each player is $x$ and $y$, also the probability of draw is $z$ . Each turn will be repeated until one player has all the money. To be honest, I can't answer this question and I really don't get it. I left my answer sheet totally empty for this one.

773098,"Continuity, derivatives of rational function","I'm studying the continuity of a function and its derivatives checking if the function is continuous, differentiable and calculating some derivatives.
The function is \begin{cases}
\dfrac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2}& \text{if }\, (x,y)\neq 0\\
0& \text{if}\,\, (x,y)=0
\end{cases} I'm asked to study the continuity in $(0,0)$. My work: I started checking the limit of the function for $(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)$ and considered the trasformation in polar coordinates to get a easier limit: $$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow 0} \frac{\rho^3\cos^2\theta \sin\theta}{\rho^2}=\lim_{\rho\rightarrow 0} \rho \cos^2\theta \sin\theta=0$$ So I got the continuity. Then I've been asked to study the value of partial derivatives in $(0,0)$ and the directional derivatives in $(0,0)$ calculated on $y=x$. I calculated the derivatives: $f_x=\dfrac{2xy^3}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$,
this is not defined in $(0,0)$ so I considered the limit using polar coordinates again, and I got: $$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow 0} \frac{2\rho^4 \cos\theta \sin^3\theta}{\rho^4}=2\cos\theta \sin^3\theta$$ Is it right? What can I say now about this limit? The value of the derivatives in this point is supposed to be $0$ according to the solution given but I'm stuck in this point. Besides  $f_y=\dfrac{x^4-x^2y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$, from which I get to the same kind of problem (again the values is supposed to be $0$) Finally the directional derivatives: I used the definition and got: the vector of the direction is $(\sqrt2/2;\sqrt2/2)$ and $f(0,0)=0$ so $$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(\frac{\sqrt2}{2}t;\frac{\sqrt2}{2}t)-0}{t}=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{2}t^2\cdot\frac{\sqrt2}{2}t}{\frac{1}{2}t^2+\frac{1}{2}t^2}\cdot\frac{1}{t}=\frac{\frac{\sqrt2}{4}t^3}{t^2}\cdot\frac{1}{t}=\frac{\sqrt2}{4}$$ I have no idea how to finish the discussion of the two first derivatives and so how to check if the whole function is differentiable in the point $(0,0)$","['partial-derivative', 'derivatives', 'limits']"

773123,Conditions on certain entries of a matrix to ensure one Jordan block per eigenvalue,"In preparation for a future exam, I found the following problem: Let $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & a & b \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c & 3 & -2 \\ 0 & d & 2 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$ Determine conditions on $a,b,c,d$ so that there is only one Jordan block for each eigenvalue of $A$ (in the Jordan canonical form of $A$).

Now I have to prove that ${\rm Aut}(S_3) \cong S_3$ . I noticed that evaluating an automorphism in an element of $X$ and taking the product of that with any other cycle doesn't work, since there's no way you're getting all of $S_3$ out of that. Evaluation in general doesn't seem too useful in general. I tried googling for a bit and found a pdf that says the following: Any automorphism of $S_3$ must send elements of order $2$ to elements of order $2$ ; in this case the only elements of order $2$ are the transpositions, so an element of ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ permutes the transpositions: that is, we obtain a map $\varphi:{\rm Aut}(S_3) \rightarrow S_{ \{(1\,2),(2\,3),(1\,3)\}}$ . Since the transpositions generate $S_3$ , this map is injective. On the other hand $\#{\rm Aut}(S_3) \geq 6$ , since ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ contains the inner automorphisms and $Z(S_3)$ is trivial. Hence $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. I understand that since the $2$ -cycles generate $S_3$ any automorphism is determined by its values in them  but I'm not sure what $\varphi$ would look like nor why it has to exist exactly. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Edit : I think I've got it.

773213,Is the function $f(x)=x$ on $\{\pm\frac1n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ differentiable at $0$?,"This is really a question of definitions. If a function $f$ is not defined on an open set containing $x$, how do we define the derivative of $f$? Is it sufficient to be locally approximable by linear functions on its points of definition, or do we consider the function not differentiable here? I am interested in defining a function $D:\Bbb R^{\subseteq\Bbb R}\to\Bbb R^{\subseteq\Bbb R}$ such that $x\in\operatorname{dom}D(f)$ and $D(f)(x)=f'(x)$ whenever $f$ is differentiable at $x$. When $f$ has a peculiar domain in the neighborhood of $x$, the exact definition of the limit is confusing me. What is the derivative at an isolated point? Edit: Here is my proposed definition for a derivative, defined as a predicate on possible limits, that makes sense when $x_0$ is an accumulation point of $A$, the domain of $f$, even if $x_0\notin A$: $f$ has derivative $L$ at $x_0$ iff for all $\varepsilon>0$, there is a $\delta$ such that for any $x,y$, $$x,y\in A\cap B(x_0,\delta)\wedge x\ne y\implies\left|\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}-L\right|<\varepsilon.$$ This definition actually makes sense even if $x_0$ is an isolated point or an exterior point of $A$, but in these cases $f$ has every number as a derivative (by contrast to when $f$ is genuinely not differentiable in the conventional sense, in which case no number is a derivative). If one adds the proviso ""$x_0$ is an interior point of $A\cup\{x_0\}$"", one recovers the conventional definition, except that the point $x_0$ is not required to be defined, which allows you to patch over removable singularities.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'definition']"

I was able to check this identity for some small values of $n$, i.e., 2, 4, 10, etc. with the help of Mathematica. Is applying the definition of matrix exponential the way to prove this identity?

773476,Geometry of Commuting Hermitian Matrices,"I am a physicist working on a project dedicated to the quantisation of commuting matrix models. In the appropriate formalism this problem is reduced to a quantisation in a curved space -- the space of commuting matrices. The general prescription for quantisation in curved space involves ambiguity of the Hamiltonian operator proportional to the scalar curvature of the curved space - hence my question. A set of $p$ commuting $n\times n$ hermitian matrices $X^{\mu}$ for $\mu=1,\dots p$, is parametrised in terms of a set of $p$ diagonal matrices $\Lambda^{\mu}$ and an unitary matrix $U$ via: $X^{\mu}=U\,\Lambda^{\mu}\,U^{\dagger}~~$   for $~\mu=1\dots p$, clearly not all degrees of U contribute to this parametrisation, for example a reparametrisation $U'= D\,U$, where $D$ is a diagonal unitary matrix would result in the same set of commuting matrices. In other words only the elements of the quotient space $U(n)\,/\,U(1)^n$, which is the maximal flag manifold $F_n$, contribute to the parametrisation. The metric on the resulting curved manifold can be calculated as a pull-back of the metric on the space of hermitian matrices defined as: $ds_{X}^2=Tr\,\left( dX^{\mu}dX^{\mu}\right) $ , Using that $U^{\dagger}d X^{\mu} U=d\Lambda^{\mu}+[\theta,\Lambda^{\mu}]~~$, where $\theta$ is the Maurer-Cartan form $\theta=U^{\dagger}dU$, one can write the induced metric as: $ds^2=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(d\vec\lambda_i)^2+2\sum\limits_{i<j}(\vec\lambda_i-\vec\lambda_j)^2\theta_{ij}\bar{\theta}_{ij}~~$, where $~~\vec \lambda_i =(\Lambda^1_{ii},\dots,\Lambda^p_{ii})$ . Now I need the Riemann curvature of the above metric. It seems that it is convenient to work in tetrad formalism, using tetrads $E_{ij}=|\vec\lambda_i-\vec\lambda_j|\,\theta_{ij}$, for $i<j$. The problem is that $d E_{ij}$ will now contain a term proportional to $(\theta_{ii}-\theta_{jj})\wedge\theta_{ij}$ and since $\theta_{ii}$ are not part of the basis the spin curvature cannot be written easily without using the explicit parametrisation of $U(n)$. Intuitively, I know that the scalar curvature should depend only on the lambdas ($\vec\lambda_i$), and I have verified that explicitly for $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$, however a general result seems to require some invariant way to express the pullback of the term $(\theta_{ii}-\theta_{jj})\wedge\theta_{ij}$ on the submanifold spanned by the off diagonal $\theta$'s. I was wondering if mathematicians have explored the manifold of commuting hermitian matrices. In fact even a reference to a convenient parametrisation of the maximal flag manifold $F_n$ would greatly help me in deriving a general expression for the scalar curvature. Any comments/suggestions are welcomed.","['matrices', 'manifolds', 'reference-request', 'curvature']"
773484,Let X be a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point. Prove that X is compact.,"Let $X$ be a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point. Prove that $X$ is compact. The following is my proof I'd like to know if it is correct. Proof: I will use the fact that if $X$ is a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point, then $X$ has a countable base, so every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover $\{G_n\}$ . To lead contradiction, suppose that there is no finite subcollection of $\{G_n\}$ which covers $X$ . Then the complement $F_n$ of $G_1 \cup \dots \cup G_n$ is nonempty for each $n$ , $\bigcap F_n$ is empty because if we assume it is nonempty then there is a point $x\in \bigcap F_n$ for which $x\in F_n$ for every $n$ . Since $F_n = (G_1 \cup \cdots \cup G_n)^c$ this means that $x\notin G_1 \cup \cdots G_n$ for every $n$ which contradicts the assumption that $\{G_n\}$ is a countable cover of $X$ . So we can choose $x_1$ that doesn't belong to $G_1$ and $x_2$ distinct from $x_1$ that doesn't belong to $G_1 \cup G_2$ and recursively, get a sequence of distinct points $\{x_n\}$ such that each $x_n$ is from $F_n$ . Let's call this set $E$ . We can take distinct points here so $E$ is infinite (since if it is finite then $E=\{x_1,\dots, x_k\}$ . Then each $x_i$ is covered by some $G_m$ , we can take a union of at most $k$ such covers and since it is only a finite union, by assumption, there exists another point outside the union that belongs to $E$ . This is true because $F_n$ is a decreasing sequence of sets and so for the largest set $F_n$ from which we extract points in the set $E$ , we must have $x_n \notin G_{k_1} \cup \cdots \cup G_{k_n}$ ). This is a contradiction since we have another point in the set $E$ that is equal to $x_n$ (since the recursive process is finite so at some point we have repetitive points) and $x_n$ must belong to some $G_{k_j}$ .This proves that $E$ is infinite. Now by hypothesis, $E$ has a limit point $z$ . Then, $z$ belongs to some open cover $G_m$ and so there is an open ball $B(z;d)\subset G_m$ . But then, by our construction, all $x_n$ for which $n \ge m$ , do not belong to $B(z;d)$ since if it does then $x_n$ belongs to the union of $G_1,\dots,G_n$ and so $x_n \notin F_n$ , which contradicts the way we defined $x_n$ . So there is an open ball containing $z$ which doesn't contain infinitely many points of $E$ , which contradicts the assumption that it is a limit point. Thus, by way of contradiction, there must be a finite subcover. Now the proof is not yet fully complete. All we have shown is that if $X$ has a countable cover then it always has a finite subcover. We want this to hold for all open covers. However, this is dealt since from Exercise 23 we know that $X$ has a countable base and this allows us to always extract a countable subcover of $X$ from any given open cover. QED. This is my proof but I have a couple points that I'm not sure of. First, how do I guarantee that I can select all distinct points of $x_n$ by the above process? Also, is my proof that $E$ must be an infinite set correct? Is there anything incorrect about the rest of the proof?

Most of the sources I've encountered state this as ""a well-known result"", and move on to prove more complicated results based on it, but I don't see how this is apparent, nor can I find any proof of it. There are a few details here , but I don't see the correspondence between the details and the eventual result. There is a hint with the question that suggests finding a bijection between these configurations and placing objects into boxes. Given that the answer above is correct, and appealing to the combinatorial definition of Stirling numbers, this would imply that there are $n+1$ ""objects"" and $n-k+1$ indistinguishable ""boxes"" into which we will arrange the objects, with no box left empty. But what are we interpreting as the objects and boxes? Simple cases: $k=n$ admits exactly one configuration: all rooks along the diagonal. $k>n$ admits no valid configurations. $k=1$ admits $n(n+1)/2$ configurations (corresponding to placing the rook on each square).","['stirling-numbers', 'combinatorics']"

I am not sure what the proper assumptions should be. Tentatively, take $f(x)^{g(x)}\ge 0$ for all $x$ in the relevant domain, so that (I believe) we have $$\ln \left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right)=g(x)\ln |f(x)|$$ when $f$ is strictly positive and undefined otherwise.

First off, I believe our professor made a mistake, and really wanted us to show that $w = \log|x|$ was a BMO, just to keep everything real. That being said, by the John-Nirenburg Lemma, a function $w$ is a bounded mean oscillation (BMO) if $\displaystyle \frac{1}{|B_{r}|}\int_{B_{r}}|w-\overline{w}_{B_{r}}|\leq C$, where $B_{r}$ is a ball of radius $r$, $\displaystyle \overline{w}_{B_{r}}$ is the average value of $w$ over the ball of radius $r$ (so $\displaystyle \overline{w}_{B_{r}}$ can also be written as $\displaystyle \frac{1}{|B_{r}|}\int_{B_{r}}|w|$), and $C$ is a constant. I would like to do and understand this exercise, but so far, all I've been able to do is set it up.  I figured that since $\displaystyle w = \log|x|$, then $\displaystyle \frac{1}{|B_{r}|}\int_{B_{r}}\left|\,\log|x|-\frac{1}{|B_{r}|}\int_{B_{r}}\log|x|\, \right|$. I'm not sure how to manipulate this expression in order to show that it is $\leq C$.  Should I add and subtract some quantities? Should I try to introduce some exponentials?

I'm working my way through Gortz and I produced a solution to an exercise but it seemed too easy. I'm hoping someone can either tell me that I am indeed doing things correctly, or show me in what way my proof is insufficient.
This isn't homework but just my own personal reading. I know it's probably elementary, but please bare with me. The Statement Let k and k' be fields of differing characteristic. Let X and X' be schemes over k and k' respectively, X $\ne \emptyset$. Then, there are no morphisms X $\rightarrow$ X'. My Suggestion Suppose $f$:X$\rightarrow$X'. Let p and q be the characteristic of k and k' respectively. Then, $f^\#_x : O_{Y,f(x)} \rightarrow O_{X,x}$ is a local homomorphism of rings. Since $f^\#_x$ is local it extends to a map $O_{Y,f(x)}/M'$ to $k(O_{X,x})/M$ of the relevant fields given by taking the quotient by the relevant maximal ideals. We claim $O_{Y,f(x)}/M'$ and $O_{X,x}/M$ have characteristic p and q respectively, because they are the quotient of direct limits of rings of characteristic p and q.*  But the category of fields is not connected, and has connected component the fields of various characteristic. Hence, there can be no such morphism. * So this is the assertion I am least sure of. Is characteristic preserved in the inductive limit? If so, what would be a good reference for me to see the proof of this, or is it obvious and I'm just not seeing it? Lastly, I want to know if this is a general sort of argument in scheme theory. Should I try this approach more often when disproving the existence of morphisms, or is passing to the quotient of the stalk not the right idea?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'positive-characteristic']"

Both the integrand and the nature of $B$ suggest a change to spherical coordinates.  As we know, the volume elements for Cartesian and spherical coordinates are related by $dx dy dz=\rho^2\sin(\varphi)d\rho d\varphi d\theta$, so the original triple integral is equal to the following iterated integral in spherical coordinates: $\int^{2\pi}_{0}\int^{\pi}_{0}\int^{2}_{0}\frac{\rho^2\sin(\varphi)}{\sqrt{\rho^2+3}}d\rho d\varphi d\theta$ The $\rho$-integral here isn't very pleasant to compute, though I suppose it's possible by means of a trigonometric substitution. My questions are: Was it the right decision to switch to spherical coordinates in the first place (as opposed to Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates)?  And if spherical coordinates are the best choice of coordinates, is there an easier way to do the $\rho$-integral than via the trig substitution $\rho=\sqrt{3}\tan(\alpha)$ for $-\pi/2<\alpha<\pi/2$ (assuming I've set up the iterated integral correctly)?","['definite-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'integration']"

(b) If $\varepsilon>0$ then $|\Omega|^{-1/p}\|f\|_p\ge\|f\|_{\infty}-\varepsilon$ for $p$ sufficiently big.

Now onto proving the second one. I'm having a lot of trouble, I used an idea from here , but instead of getting the measure of $\Omega$, I get the measure of a subset, and I'm not using that $p$ has to be big or not, that part of the hint confuses me really, I can't see how do you use it for the problem.","['lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

There is, however, another feature of the Zariski topology: it is locally connected and locally irreducible, which allows us to rephrase the definition of dimension at a point $x\in X$ as the largest $n$ for which there is a chain of connected, locally connected, closed nowhere dense (i.e. with empty interior) sets $x\in C_1\subsetneq C_2\subsetneq\dots C_n\subseteq X$ with each $C_i$ nowhere dense in $C_{i+1}$ (in the subspace topology).

774367,Deck Building Probability Stats for Fun/Beginners (HEX tcg),"EDIT Given the amount of time spent on the problem I eventually solved it, so below I leave the structure of the original problem and the answer I came up with. I will be writing it up over the next few days, as I want to explain it clearly and share for opinions, if you have any. Hello mathematical community. I picked up a deck building game (HEX TCG) and set out to find out the inner workings of resource management without more than the bare bones of and engineer's knowledge of statistics. I came to my solution after a week and below is the explanation of the problem and how I attacked it applying principles of probabilities, please enjoy and share your views. Please take note that I may use terminologies in a slightly personal way as that is my relationship with statistical maths, though I am making my best effort to describe it with the correct terms. Intro: A deck is constituted by 60 cards . There are several types of cards but for this problem we only need focus on 2 types of cards, type 1: resource cards and, type 2: non-resource cards . Resources are needed to play cards. How the cards are played: On the opening turn of the game the player draws 7 cards from the deck into their hand. Which player goes first is decided by a coin flip. The player that goes second only is allowed to draw an extra card on the opening turn. During each turn (including the opening turn) the player is allowed to play only 1 resource from their hand, if they possess one. Once played it stays on the field. At the beginning of each new turn each player draws 1 card from the remaining deck. The problem: The objective of a player building their deck is to build it with enough resources to give them the best chance of playing a minimum number of resources to the field as fast as possible. This minimum number of resources the player should aim to play as fast as possible is dictated by the highest costing cards in the player's deck (cards can cost up to 7 resources). It is obvious that if you had 100% resources this would maximise the probabilities but then the player wouldn't be able to do anything so the objective is to draw up a relationship to calculate the optimal number and its associated probability of being playable. For the sake of keeping the problem simple I analysed the maths and the effect on the initial 10 turns , read ahead. The Stats The first part of the problem consisted in describing the probability of drawing a specific number of resources into the players hands in the opening turn based on whether the player draws 7 or 8 or whether the player Mulligans (decides to redraw their hand, but in doing so draw 1 card less). Drawing The First Hand I first of all calculated how many permutation (without repetitions) the probability tree yields for each drawn amount of cards using equation: $$\frac{n!}{r!\,(n-r)!} \tag{1}\label{1}$$ where $n=$Total drawn cards ($1\leq n\leq8$) $r=$Total drawn resource cards ($0\leq r\leq7$) This yields the amount of different combinations in which a given number of $r$ can be drawn into the players hand below is the case for $r=7$: Resources drawn (r)   0    1     2     3     4     5    6    7
No. of permutations   1    7    21    35    35    21    7    1 This is to be multiplied by the probability of drawing that number of resource cards into the players hand which I worked out as the following equation: $$\left(\frac{\frac{T_{R}!}{(T_{R}-r)!}\times\frac{T_{N}!}{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}}{\frac{T!}{(T-n)!}}\right) \tag{2}\label{2}$$ Where (as above $n=$Total drawn cards and $r=$Drawn resources) and: $T_{R}=$Total resources in initial deck. $T_{N}=$ Total non-resources in initial deck. $T=$Total initial deck cards. It follows that that $T_{R}+T_{N}=T=60$. Below is the calculated example for the case$T_{R}=23$ and $r=3$ resources drawn for $n=7$ cards drawn into hand. $$\left(\frac{\frac{23!}{(23-3)!}\times\frac{37!}{(37-(7-3))!}}{\frac{60!}{(60-7)!}}\right)=\left(\frac{(23\cdot22\cdot21)\times(37\cdot36\cdot35\cdot34)}{60\cdot59\cdot58\cdot57\cdot56\cdot55\cdot54}\right)=0.008653\dots$$ The final probability, which I will call $P(n,r)$, for any given value of $n$ and $r$, is simply equation $\eqref{1}\times$ equation $\eqref{2}$ as follows: $$\left(\frac{n!}{r!\,(n-r)!}\right)\times\left(\frac{\frac{T_{R}!}{(T_{R}-r)!}\times\frac{T_{N}!}{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}}{\frac{T!}{(T-n)!}}\right)=P(n,r) \tag{3}\label{3}$$ So once again for the above case where $T_{R}=23$ $$P(n=7,r=3)=0.008653\dots\times35=30.29\%$$ I could hence at this point graph the probability curves for all values of drawn resources $r$ (when drawing $n=7$ cards for the below image) for all values of possible $T_{R}$ resources in the deck: Resources in a deck vs probability of drawing $r$ resources into an $n=7$ hand Drawing Each Turn The next step involved the same maths but applied to the situation of drawing resources with each turn. This yields a second probability tree and a formula identical to equation $\eqref{1}$ to calculate the amount of permutations (again without repetition) for the amount of resources drawn and turns played: $$\left(\frac{n_{2}!}{r_{2}!\,(n_{2}-r_{2})!}\right) \tag{4}\label{4}$$ Where: $n_{2}=$Number of turns after drawing turn. $r_{2}=$Number of resources drawn in the turns $n_{2}$. The second part for the formula to describe this situation is the same as equation $\eqref{2}$ but this time with the $r_{2}$ and $n_{2}$ terms added to the factorials as follows: $$\left(\frac{\frac{(T_{R}-r)!}{(T_{R}-r-r_{2})!}\times\frac{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}{(T_{N}-(n-r)-(n_{2}-r_{2}))!}}{\frac{(T-n)!}{(T-n-n_{2})!}}\right) \tag{5}\label{5}$$ Where (as above $n_{2}=$Number of turns and $r_{2}=$Drawn resources in those turns) and: $T_{R}=$Total resources in initial deck. $T_{N}=$ Total non-resources in initial deck. $T=$Total initial deck cards. Once again multiply the number of permutations based on $r_{2}$ (equation $\eqref{4}$ by equation $\eqref{5}$: $$\left(\frac{n_{2}!}{r_{2}!\,(n_{2}-r_{2})!}\right)\times\left(\frac{\frac{(T_{R}-r)!}{(T_{R}-r-r_{2})!}\times\frac{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}{(T_{N}-(n-r)-(n_{2}-r_{2}))!}}{\frac{(T-n)!}{(T-n-n_{2})!}}\right)=P(n_{2},r_{2}) \tag{6}\label{6}$$ to get probability $P(n_{2},r_{2})$. The graph of which looks as below: Resources in deck vs the probability of drawing $r_{2}=5$ resources in $n_{2}=10$ turns given the amount of resourced already drawn into hand in the opening phase ($n=1$) Intercept Probability Now if we take equation $\eqref{3}$ as being equal to $P(A)$ and $\eqref{6}$ as being equal to $P(B|A)$ then: $$P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B|A)$$ Meaning: $$P(A\cap B)=\left(\frac{n!}{r!\,(n-r)!}\right)\times\left(\frac{\frac{T_{R}!}{(T_{R}-r)!}\times\frac{T_{N}!}{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}}{\frac{T!}{(T-n)!}}\right)\times\left(\frac{n_{2}!}{r_{2}!\,(n_{2}-r_{2})!}\right)\times\left(\frac{\frac{(T_{R}-r)!}{(T_{R}-r-r_{2})!}\times\frac{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}{(T_{N}-(n-r)-(n_{2}-r_{2}))!}}{\frac{(T-n)!}{(T-n-n_{2})!}}\right) \tag{7}\label{7}$$ Which finally gives the probability of drawing $r_{2}$ resource cards over a period of $n_{2}$ turns, based on the probability of having drawn $r$ resources into a hand of size $n$! For the same case as shown just above of $P(B|A)$ where $n_{2}=10$ and $r_{2}=5$, the $P(A\cap B)$ gives the following graph: Resources in a deck vs the probability of drawing $r_{2}=5$ resources within $n_{2}=10$ turns given the player has drawn $r$ resources in an opening hand of size $n=7$ Limits of the Equations It is important at this point to note the limits within which these equations don't break. The cases which return non-computable values are associated to factorials of negative numbers. These arise in the following cases and corresponding IF statements should be included as advised: For equation $\eqref{3}$: IF $T_{N}<(n-r)$ is TRUE then set $\left(\frac{T_{N}!}{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}\right)=0$ otherwise it would be an invalid number. IF $(T_{R}-r)<0$ is TRUE then set $\left(\frac{T_{R}!}{(T_{R}-r)!}\right)=0$ otherwise it will be an invalid number. For equation $\eqref{6}$: IF $(T_{N}-(n-r))<(n_{2}-r_{2})$ is TRUE then set $\left(\frac{(T_{N}-(n-r))!}{(T_{N}-(n-r)-(n_{2}-r_{2})!}\right)=0$ otherwise it will be an invalid number. IF $(T_{R}-r-r_{2})<0$ is TRUE then set $\left(\frac{(T_{R}-r)!}{(T_{R}-r-r_{2})!}\right)=0$ otherwise it will be an invalid number. Conclusion So above I have described the formulation of the equations associated with being able to solve the issue associated with resource optimisation in a deck, now how do we apply it to give us a usable number?

$$\tag1 \Rightarrow \left( \frac 3 5  \right)^x + \left( \frac { 4 }{ 5 }  \right)^x =1$$
$\because \frac { 3 }{ 5 }  \leqslant 1 \Rightarrow \sin \theta =\frac { 3 }{ 5 }$ would be valid. We know, $\sin^2 \theta +\cos ^2 \theta =1$. $\Leftrightarrow \cos^2 \theta =1-\sin ^2 \theta$. $$ \Leftrightarrow \cos \theta =\sqrt { 1- \left( \frac { 3 }{ 5 }  \right)^2 } =\frac { 4 }{ 5 }$$ $\therefore \sin \theta =\frac { 3 }{ 5 } \ \land \ \cos\theta =\frac { 4 }{ 5 }$.

Edit 2: The statement in the paper is that there always exists a projection of the smallest norm on a fixed finite dimensional subspace (the inf is attained), and that it follows from a ""compactness argument"". I wrongly assumed that the set of projections must be compact (thank you Martin). I think what is enough is to consider the set of projection with norm smaller than dimension of the finite dimensional subspace. Is the set compact in this case? If it is, it will prove the claim, as the continuous function $P\to\|P\|$ would attain the minimum on this set.","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"
774732,Intuition and the math behind normalization,"What exactly is the purpose of normalization. From what I read, it is to adjust two different sets of values so you can compare them, but I don't understand why, nor the math behind it. Could anyone answer this by also giving a concrete example? Thanks!","['statistics', 'multivariable-calculus', 'normal-distribution', 'regression']"

774775,Holomorphic function is bijective if neutral fixed point,"I have a question that asks If $S \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a bounded domain and $f : S \to S$ is a holomorphic map such that $f(p) = p$ and $|f'(p)| = 1$ for some $p \in S$, then $f$ is bijective. I am aware of this question: Bijective holomorphic map with a fixed point ,which seems to suggest that the problem is wrong.  However, in that question the suggested counterexample is $g(z) = z + z^2$ and I can't think of a bounded domain such that $g(S) \subseteq S$. This question is the second part of a larger question, the first part of which states that (under the same notation) $f(z) = z$ for all $z \in S$ if $f(p) = p$ and $f'(p) = 1$, so I'm assuming this result is going to be useful somehow.  Also, since there is a fixed point involved, the answer is surely going to use some complex dynamics ideas somewhere. I know that the multiplier of a fixed point is conjugation invariant, so could I conjugate $f$ by some conformal map $\varphi$ to get $(\varphi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1})'(p) = 1$?  If so then $f(z) = z$ for all $z \in S$ by the previous result.  This is pretty optimistic, and I have my doubts, but it is all I have at this point.  Any help would be seriously appreciated!!",['complex-analysis']

774955,finite k-vector space noetherian,"Let $k$ be a field and $A \supset k$ a ring that is finite dimensional as a $k$-vector space,  prove that A is Noetherian and Artinian. For the first part, I've been trying to use a.a.c condition, so for all chain of ideals of $A$ $$I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq...\subseteq I_k\subseteq...$$
we have that $$V_1 \subseteq V_2 \subseteq...\subseteq V_k\subseteq...$$
where $V_j=A/I_j$ k-vector space of dimension $n_j$. Using that $dim(A)$ is finite, we conclude 
$$0 \leq n_1 \leq...\leq n_k\leq...\leq dim(A)$$ so necessary $\exists n\in \mathbb{N}: n_n=n_{n+1}=...$ (Suppossing not we have a contradiction). So A is Noetherian. For Artinian I've made the same but with d.c.c and with the inequality $$0\leq... \leq n_k \leq...\leq n_1\leq dim(A)$$ It's my solution right?
