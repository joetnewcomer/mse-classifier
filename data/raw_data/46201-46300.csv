463051,Beach Path math question,"Anyone who has walked on the beach knows that walking speed is dependent upon how far away from the ocean one walks. If you walk on the wet sand you can walk much more quickly than if you walked on the dry sand. I have a question that discusses this principal. On a Cartesian $xy$ plane limited by: Domain: {$x|0 \le x \le 1$} Range: {$y|0 \le y \le 1$} you start at the point ($0,0$) and you would like to travel on a defined path to ($1,1$) in the shortest amount of time. This sounds simple just take the path $y=x$ because it is the shortest path so it will take the shortest amount of time, but there is a catch. Your forward speed $\frac{dS}{dt}$ is equal to ($1−\frac{3}{4}y$). With this constraint in mind the path $y=x$ would not be the fastest path. What is the fastest path. I am open to questions about the problem itself if I have not been clear. Thank you.","['geometry', 'calculus-of-variations']"
463073,Why does the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality hold in any inner product space?,"I am working through linear algebra problems in Apostol's Calculus , and he has numerous problems that seem to imply that Cauchy-Schwarz holds no matter how the inner product is defined. Then, he has problems where the triangle inequality holds despite alternative definitions of vector norm. This got me thinking, since the proof of the triangle inequality in Apostol relies on Cauchy-Schwarz, that the triangle inequality would hold regardless of how the vector norm is defined (if it involves the dot product). I then found this response to a question, which states what I was thinking. Are there any proofs that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds in any inner product space (I looked for some and found none and could not prove it myself)? I've had a semester of algebra (Artin) and some analysis, if there is a proof at such a level of understanding. Intuitive explanations are good, too.","['inner-products', 'linear-algebra', 'inequality']"

Are there some condtions on how fast the moments grow can be added to help? Attempt at solution:
I know that if the characteristic functions split like $E(e^{i(X,Y)\cdot(s,t)}) = E(e^{iXs})E(e^{iYt})$, (where $.$ is the Schur product) then the RV's are independent. I would try to approximate this by the moments.

463127,Does this integral have a closed form expression?,"I have been working with two related integrals. The first one yields a simple expression, but I can't seem to find a simple expression for the second. Integral 1 $$ \begin{align*}
I_x &= \int_z^{1-y+z} \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-x-y+z} + \frac{1}{x-z}} \, dx\\
&= \int_z^{1-y+z} \sqrt{\frac{1-y}{(1-x-y+z)(x-z)}} \, dx\\
&= \sqrt{1-y} \int_z^{1-y+z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-x-y+z)(x-z)}} \, dx\\
\end{align*} $$ We can substitute $u=\frac{x-z}{1-y}$, so $x=u(1-y)+z$, and $dx=(1-y) \, du$. Then we have: $$ \begin{align*}
I_x &= \sqrt{1-y} \int_0^1 u^{\frac{1}{2}-1}(1-u)^{\frac{1}{2}-1} \, du\\
&= \sqrt{1-y} \, \operatorname{B} \left( \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2} \right)\\
&= \sqrt{1-y} \, \pi

Integral 2 $$ I_z = \int_{\max(0,x+y-1)}^{\min(x,y)} \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-x-y+z} + \frac{1}{x-z} + \frac{1}{y-z} + \frac{1}{z}} \, dz $$ This seems related to the first integral, but I can't seem to simplify it. Even if we assume one of the four ""cases"" of integration limits ($\int_0^x$, $\int_0^y$, $\int_{x+y-1}^x$, or $\int_{x+y-1}^y$) and try to proceed, it doesn't seem to help. Am I missing something simple? Is there an obscure integration technique that would help? Or is there just no way to simplify this?

463216,Counting numbers of the form $ai + bj + cij$ and finding related L-series?,"Let $a,b,c$ be given nonnegative integers with $gcd(a,b,c)=1$. Consider a given positive integer $n$ and positive integers $i,j$. Let $f_n(a,b,c)$ be the number of distinct solutions to $1<ai + bj + cij<n$. As an example $f_n(1,1,2) = n-(\pi(2n+1)-1)$ where $\pi$ is the prime counting function. And ofcourse $f_n(0,0,1)=n-\pi(n)$. Other easy ones are $f_n(0,b,c)$ or $f_n(a,b,0)$. But how about the general case ?? How about $f_n(2,3,5)$ ? I assume there is alot of theory behind this such as closed form identities, recursions, related L-series, GRH analogues and sieves. And what about the circle method ; can it be used here ? Are there generalizations to PNT involved ? I would like to understand $f_n(a,b,c)$ better. EDIT !! I have seen tommy1729 today and he guessed that for $a=2,2<p<q$ and $p,q$ a prime twin or a sophie germain prime pair, we have that $f_n(2,p,q)$ ~ $n - \dfrac{\alpha\pi(n)}{q!}$ where $\alpha$ is an integer. For instance $f_n(2,3,5)$ should be about $n - \dfrac{\pi(n)}{k}$ where $k$ is $2$ or $3$.
The ""logic"" is suppose to be that we sieve out multiples of type $5n+2$ or $5n+3$ for numbers of type $5n + 6$ as explained by Gerry Myerson's answer. This sieved part is suppose to be something like $\dfrac{n}{\sum \dfrac{1}{5y+m}}$ for $m=2,3$ or such, from where $n - \dfrac{\pi(n)}{k}$ follows. I wondered about products like $\prod_{X=5n+2} (1-\dfrac{1}{X})$. I was fascinated by that quick brute guess he made. Could it be true ?

We want to show that under the norm induced by this inner product $$
(u,v)_{E(\Omega)}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_j, v_j)_{L^2(\Omega)}+(\text{div } u, \text{div }v)_{L^2(\Omega)}
$$ $(E(\Omega), ||.||_{E(\Omega)})$ is a Hilbert Space. This is what I manage to do. Suppose $\{u_m=(u^1, \cdots , u^n)\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(E(\Omega), ||.||_{E(\Omega)})$. Fix $i \in \{1,\cdots, n \}$. Because $(u^i_m-u^i_l, u^i_m-u^i_l )$=$||u^i_m-u^i_l ||^2_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq  ||u_m-u_l||^2_{E(\Omega)}$ and the fact that $\{u_m=(u^1, \cdots , u^n)\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(E(\Omega), ||.||_{E(\Omega)})$, we see that $\{u^i_m\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\Omega)$. By the completeness of $L^2(\Omega)$, we concluded that $u^i_m \rightarrow u^i \in L^2(\Omega)$ in $L^2$ norm as $m\rightarrow \infty$. Hence we concluded that $u=(u^1, \cdots, u^n) \in \{L^2(\Omega)\}^n$. Also note that $$
(\text{div }(u_m-u_l), \text{div }(u_m-u_l))_{L^2(\Omega)}=||\text{div } u_m - \text{div } u_l||^2_{L^2(\Omega)}\leq ||u_m-u_l||^2_{E(\Omega)}
$$ Hence $\{\text{div } u_m\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy  in $L^2(\Omega)$. Again by the completeness of $L^2(\Omega)$, we can conclude that $\text{div } u_m \rightarrow g\in L^2(\Omega)$ in $L^2$ norm as $m \rightarrow \infty$. Now to show $u \in E(\Omega)$, we need to show $\text{div } u$ exists and is also in $L^2(\Omega)$. This is achieved by showing $g=\text{div }u$. But this is where I get stuck, how do we show this last part? I don't even know that the partial derivative of $u^i$ exists. Thanks.","['partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

463281,Problem on quasi - compact morphisms of schemes,"I am doing a problem a problem in Hartshorne (2.3.2) which asks to show that a morphism of schemes $f : X \to Y$ is quasi compact iff for every affine open $U \subseteq Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is quasi compact. Now one direction is tautological so for the other direction take $U \subseteq Y$ an affine open subset. Let $\{V_i\}$ be a cover of $Y$ by open affines such that for every $i$, $f^{-1}(V_i)$ is quasi - compact. Then for every $i$ we can write $$U \cap V_i =  \bigcup_{j} V_{ij}$$ where the $V_{ij}$ are open and principal in both $U$ and $V_i$ . Since $\bigcup_i (U \cap V_i) = \bigcup_i \bigcup_j V_{ij}$ is an open cover of $U$ and since $U$ is quasi compact, this means $U = \bigcup_{k=1}^n V_{i_k j_k}$ for some indices $i_k,j_k$. Thus $f^{-1}(U)$ is a finite union of the open sets $f^{-1}(V_{i_k,j_k})$. Now if each of these is quasi - compact then $f^{-1}(U)$ being a finite union of quasi - compact sets is quasi - compact. My question is: Why is each $f^{-1}(V_{i_k,j_k})$ quasi - compact? I know that for every $i_k$, $f^{-1}(V_{i_k})$ can be covered by a finite union of open affine sets by assumption. Does this mean then that $f^{-1}(V_{i_k,j_k})$ is principal in each of these open affines (and thus quasi - compact)?",['algebraic-geometry']

463321,Primes of ramification index 1 with inseparable residue field extension,"I've been reading through Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory , and I'm a little puzzled about a possibility with ramification of primes. As usual, let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions $K$, let $L/K$ be a finite algebraic extension, and let $\mathcal{O}_L$ be the algebraic closure of $\mathcal{O}_K$ in $L$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $\mathcal{O}_K$, and let $\mathfrak{p} = \prod_{i=1}^{r} \mathfrak{P}_i^{e_i}$ be its prime factorization in $\mathcal{O}_L$. Neukirch defines $\mathfrak{P}_i$ to be unramified over $\mathcal{O}_K$ provided that $e_i = 1$ and the residue field $\mathcal{O}_L/\mathfrak{P}_i$ is separable over $\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{p}$. It's the latter condition that has me wondering: What if $e_i = 1$, but the residue field extension is inseparable (perhaps even purely inseparable)? In other words, can a prime be ramified despite having ramification index 1? The definition suggests it can, but no examples readily come to mind, probably because most of the examples I've worked with are perfect fields. Also, is there some good geometric way of thinking about what it means for a point to be ramified with ramification index 1?

  proof assumed that for any positive integers $m$ and $n$, the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$
  can be written in lowest terms, that is, in the form $\frac{m'}{n'}$ where $m'$
  and $n'$ are positive integers with no common factors. How do we know
  this is always possible? Suppose to the contrary that there were $m$, $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ cannot be written in lowest
  terms. Now let $C$ be the set of positive integers that are numerators
  of such fractions. Then $m$ in $C$, so $C$ is nonempty. Therefore, by Well
  Ordering, there must be a smallest integer, $m_0$ in $C$. So by definition of
  $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that the fraction $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be
  written in lowest terms. This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common
  factor, $p > 1$. But $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p}) = \frac{m_0}{n_0}$ so any way of expressing the left hand fraction in lowest terms would
  also work for $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$, which implies the fraction($\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p})$ cannot be in written in lowest terms either. So by definition of $C$, the numerator, $\frac{m_0}{p}$, is in $C$. But $\frac{m_0}{p} < m_0$,
  which contradicts the fact that $m_0$ is the smallest element of $C$. Since
  the assumption that $C$ is nonempty leads to a contradiction, it follows
  that $C$ must be empty. That is, that there are no numerators of
  fractions that can’t be written in lowest terms, and hence there are
  no such fractions at all. I don't really understand the part where, the author says: So by definition of $C$, there is an integer $n_0 > 0$ such that: $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be written in lowest terms. This means that $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor, $p > 1$. Why $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be written in lowest terms means $m_0$ and $n_0$ must have a common factor? What does '$\frac{m_0}{n_0}$ cannot be written in lowest terms' actually means? I'm not native English speaker so it may be confusing at places to understand the words. And I don't quite understand this statement, too: But: $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p}) = \frac{m_0}{n_0}$ so any way of expressing the left hand fraction in lowest terms would also work for $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$, which implies the fraction $(\frac{m_0}{p}) / (\frac{n_0}{p})$ cannot be in written in lowest terms either.

My proof was the following: write $n = 4q + r$ where $q$ is the quotient of the division by $4$ and $r$ is the remainder. Then, $S_4(n) = \{n_k \in \mathbb{Z} : n_k = 4q+(r+k), k \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}\subset \mathbb{Z}\}$. First we prove injectivity. For some $n_i, n_j \in S_4(n)$  consider $f(n_i) = f(n_j)$. But $n_i = 4q+(r+i)$ and $n_j = 4q + (r+j)$, and so $f(n_i) = r+ i$ and $f(n_j) = r+j$ and in that case we have $i = j$ implying that $n_i = n_j$ and thus $f$ is injective. To prove surjectivity we do as follows: given $a \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ we want $n_k = 4q+(r+k)$ such that $f(n_k) = a$. But this means $r+k = a$ and so we simply take $k = a - r$ which is the same as taking $n_{a -r}$, so that we have $f(n_{a-r}) = r+(a-r)=a$ as desired, so that $f$ is surjective. Is this proof correct? I think there's just a problem. First, I didn't prove that if $r$ is the remainder of $n$ by $4$ then $r+1$ is the remainder of $n+1$ by $4$. Second, I didn't prove that $a - r \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ which is necessary so that $n_{a-r} \in S_n(4)$. Are those real problems with this proof? Are any other errors there?

My question is, does the complement of a simple unbounded curve always have two connected components?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You in Advance. EDIT: As @dfeuer suggested, let's also require that the curve goes off to infinity in both directions.

Let $t(n,F)$ be the set of upper triangular matrices $(a_{ij})$, $a_{ij}=0$ if $i>j$. Let $n(n,F)$ be the strictly upper triangular matrices ($a_{ij}=0$ if $i\geq j$). Finally, let $o(n,F)$ be the set of all diagonal matrices . It is trivial to check that each of these is closed under the bracket. Notice also that $t(n,F)=o(n,F)+n(n,F)$ (vector space direct sum), with $[o(n,F),n(n,F)]=n(n,F)$, hence $[t(n,F),t(n,F)]=n(n,F)$. (If $H,K$ are subalgebras of $L$, $[H K]$ denotes the subspace of $L$ spanned by commutators $[xy]$, $x\in H, y\in K$.) I am confused about why $[t(n,F),t(n,F)]=n(n,F)$. If we have two upper triangular matrices $X,Y$, then $XY$ is also upper triangular, and so $XY-YX$ is upper triangular, so it should stay in $t(n,F)$.

463770,defining a dominant rational map from an algebra homomorphism (Theorem I 4.4 in Hartshorne),"The following shows up in the proof of theorem I 4.4 in Hartshorne. Let $X,Y$ be varieties and $\theta: K(Y) \rightarrow K(X)$ a homomorphism of $k$-algebras. We want to construct a dominant rational map $X \rightarrow Y$. We can assume that $Y$ is affine with coordinate ring $A(Y)$. Let $y_1,\cdots,y_n$ be $k$-algebra generators of $A(Y)$. Then $\theta(y_1),\cdots,\theta(y_n) \in K(X)$ and we can find an open set $U$ of $X$ such that $\theta(y_i)$ is regular on $U$. Then by restricting $\theta$ on $A(Y)$ we obtain a $k$-algebra homomorphism $A(Y) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(U)$. So far, i have clear understanding. But then Hartshorne says that the homomorphism $A(Y) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(U)$ is injective, and this is where i am stuck. Here is my effort: Let $p(y)$ be inside the kernel. Then $\theta|_{A(Y)}(p(y))=0 \Rightarrow p(\theta(y))=0 \Rightarrow p(\theta(y_1)(P),\cdots,\theta(y_n)(P))=0, \forall P \in X \Rightarrow (\theta(y_1)(P),\cdots,\theta(y_n)(P)) \in \mathcal{Z}(p)$.

Anyway the problem: Let $\mathcal{H}=\{f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{F} \,:\, f\text{ is absolutely continuous, }f(0)=0, f'\in\mathcal{L}^2(0,1)\}$ (where $\mathbb{F}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$).

$$g(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n'(x)\text{ (in $\mathcal{L}^2$'s norm)}$$

Let $P_k$ denote the $k$-Sylow subgroup and let $n_3$ denote the number of conjugates of $P_k$. $n_2 \equiv 1 \mod 2$ and $n_2 | 69 \implies n_2= 1, 3, 23, 69$ $n_3 \equiv 1 \mod 3$ and $n_3 | 184 \implies n_3 = 1, 4, 184$ $n_{23} \equiv 1 \mod 23$ and $n_{23} | 24 \implies n_{23} = 1, 24$ Suppose for contradiction that $n_{23} = 24$. Then $N(P_{23})=552/24=23$. So the normalizer of $P_3$ only contains the identity and elements of order $23$. It is impossible for $n_2$ to equal $23$ or $69$, or for $n_3$ to equal $184$, since we would then have more than $552$ elements in G. Case 1: Let $n_2 = 1$. Then we have $P_2 \triangleleft G$, and so we have a subgroup $H=P_2P_{23}$ in G. We know that $|H|=\frac{|P_2||P_{23}|}{|P_2 \cap P_{23}} = 184$. We also know that the $23$-Sylow subgroup of $H$ is normal, so it's normalizer is of order $184$. Since a $p$-sylow subgroup is the largest subgroup of order $p^k$ for some $k$; and since the order of the $23$-Sylow subgroup of H and G both equal $23$, they must coincide. But that means that elements of orders not equal to $23$ normalize $P_{23}$, which is a contradiction. Case 2: Suppose that $n_3=1$. Then we have $P_3 \triangleleft G$, and so we have a subgroup $K=P_2P_{23}$ in $G$. Since $|K|=\frac{|P_3||P_{23}|}{|P_2 \cap P_{23}}= 69$, the $23$-sylow subgroup of $K$ is normal. Again, as in case 1, we have an element of order not equal to $23$ that normalizes $P_{23}$. Case 3: Let $n_3=4$ and $n_2=3$. But then $N(P_2)=184$. So this is the same as case 1, since we have a subgroup of G of order $184$. Do you think my answer is correct?

Martin gave a very short answer to that effect here (and if someone could point me too a more elementary proof in that case I would appreciate it).

Since $x^2+1$ is its minimal polynomial, we see that $[\Bbb{Q(i)} : \Bbb{Q}]=2$ and so it must correspond to $\Bbb{Z}_3$ , and $\beta=i$ . Sending every number to its conjugate is one possible automorphism. Of course, it has order 2 and so is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_2$ . Since it fixes every real number, the corresponding intermediate field must be of the form $\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for some real number $\alpha$ , and must have degree 3 over $\Bbb{Q}$ . If we look at $\zeta_7 + \zeta_7^6$ , we see that $\cos(2\pi/7) + i\sin(2\pi/7) + cos(12\pi/7) + i\sin(12\pi/7)$ $= \cos(2\pi/7) + i\sin(2\pi/7) + \cos(-2\pi/7) + i\sin(-2\pi/7)$ $= 2\cos(2\pi/7)$ which is irrational.

But these works when we know the coordinates of $A$,$B$ and the radius of the circle. Yet this isn't the right way because the problem is to construct that point. Later I tried to approach using geometry. The smallest distance from the point $A$ to the circle is the intersection of the circle $c$ and the ray $OA$, this is the same for $B$. Then we construct circles centered on $A$ and $B$ that are tangent to $c$. If the two circle intersect we'll get a common point for the both $A$ and $B$ and the distance will be minimal.

And my proof is: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists such $A$. If we take $\epsilon=1$, we have two cases: If $A>0$, then $A - \epsilon > -1$, so $-1$ does not satisfy $|-1-A|<\epsilon$ inequality. Now for given $\delta>0$ we can take a natural number $n$ such that
$\frac{2-3\pi\delta}{4\pi\delta}<n $
and then $0<\frac{1}{\pi\left( \frac{3}{2}+2n \right)}<\delta$. But 
$$f\left( \left( \frac{3}{2}\pi+2n\pi \right)^{-1} \right)=\sin \pi\left( \frac{3}{2}+2n \right)=-1. $$ If $A\le0$, then $A+\epsilon\le1$ so $1$ does not satisfy $|1-A|<\epsilon $ inequality. Now for given $\delta>0$ we can take a natural number $n$ such that 
$\frac{2-\pi\delta}{4\pi\delta}<n $ and then 
$0<\frac{1}{\pi\left( \frac{1}{2}+2n \right)}<\delta$.
But 
$$f\left( \left( \frac{1}{2}\pi+2n\pi \right)^{-1} \right)=\sin \pi\left( \frac{1}{2}+2n \right)=1.$$ We have proved that with $\epsilon=1$ for every $\delta>0$ there exist $x$ such that $0<x<\delta$ but $|\sin \frac{1}{x} - A|<\epsilon$ does not hold.

464030,Derivation linear map examples,"From Humphreys' Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory : By an $F$-algebra (not necessarily associative) we simply mean a vector space $U$ over $F$ endowed with a bilinear operation $U\times U\rightarrow U$, usually denoted by juxtaposition (unless $U$ is a Lie algebra, in which case we always use the bracket). By a derivation of $U$ we mean a linear map $\delta:U\rightarrow U$ satisfying the familiar product rule $\delta(ab)=a\delta(b)+\delta(a)b$. I'm wondering what is an example of a derivation. Suppose I take $U=\mathbb{R}^n$. Clearly the map that takes everything to $0$ is a derivation. The map $\delta(x)=kx$ is not a derivation for $k\neq 0$, because then $kab\neq kab+kab$.

If initial position is $(0,0)$ out of those $8$ it has choice of $2$ only satisfying ""within chessboard"" constraint. Next move I am lost! Please help me think . Why cant we treat it like: a.

  How can I prove that $I=J$ ? The aforementioned canonical map $A\to A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is $a\mapsto a/1$. My attempts: I think we might need to use the following fact.

Now, if we let $M=I$ and $N=J$ (as ideals of $A$ are naturally $A$-modules), then the inclusion map $i: I\to J$ is injective. So, the induced maps $i_{\mathfrak{m}}: I_{\mathfrak{m}}\to J_{\mathfrak{m}}$ are also injective, for each maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. Now I would like to use the fact that $I$ and $J$ have same extensions in $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$. Can this approach be made to work?
