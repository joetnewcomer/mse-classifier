1587244,Mascheroni construction [duplicate],This question already has answers here : Constructing the midpoint of a segment by compass (3 answers) Closed 2 years ago . There are two points in one line and a point C which doesn't lie on the line AB. I have to construct a point D such that it is intersection of the line AB and a line which is perpendicular to the line AB and points C and D lies on this perpendicular line. I can only use compass and can't link (match) the points. It's on the picture. Thanks for any help.,"['geometric-construction', 'geometry']"

I want to prove that if I have $6$ coplanar points and the area of convex hull of these points is equal to $P$, then I can mark the points with $A,B,C,D,E,F$ so that the sum of areas of triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ is less or equal to $\frac{P}{2}$.

1587257,What assumptions did I make when I strengthened my independence criterion across a new random variable?,"I have an algorithm which tries to calculate some $\operatorname{Pr(X | Y_1 Y_2 \dots )}$ (where juxtaposition means event intersection, ""given $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ and ... have happened"".) We have some control over the events $Y_1, Y_2, \dots$ that we measure, and we choose them to make the $Y_i$ largely independent. The algorithm works by recursion on the $Y_i.$ The problem is, I made an assumption about the recursively-applied formula and it is not obviously equivalent to independence of the $Y_i$, so I would like to know how bad I've shot myself in the foot. So for the recursion we define $N = Y_k$ and $O = Y_1 \dots Y_{k-1}$ (mnemonic: ""new fact"" and ""old evidence"" respectively) -- then some repeated application of Bayes' theorem proves that you can essentially tack on an extra $|O$ to every term in the normal Bayes Theorem $\operatorname{Pr}(X|N) =  \operatorname{Pr}(N|X) / \operatorname{Pr}(N)$ to get
$$\operatorname{Pr}(X|NO) = \frac{\operatorname{Pr}(N|XO)}{\operatorname{Pr}(N|O)}\cdot \operatorname{Pr}(X|O).$$So the rightmost term will recurse down the $Y_i$; the denominator term is easily simplified on the assumption that the $Y_i$ are independent so that $\operatorname{Pr}(N | O) \approx \operatorname{Pr}(Y_k).$ Here's the problem: in my derivation I assumed that you could naively do the same to the numerator simultaneously, essentially adjoining an $|X$ to the expression $\operatorname{Pr}(N|O) \approx \operatorname{Pr}(N)$ to get $\operatorname{Pr}(N|XO) \approx \operatorname{Pr}(N|X).$ This sounds intuitively plausible, because we want to say ""all of the old events don't tell us anything about the new event because they're all independent"" -- but when this $X$ gets in the way the algebra seems to not simplify out the way that the earlier algebra did. Even worse, one of the results I derived trying to examine this looks unexpectedly symmetric:$$\operatorname{Pr}(X~N~O) = \frac{\operatorname{Pr}(X~O)~\operatorname{Pr}(X~N)~\operatorname{Pr}(N~O)}{\operatorname{Pr}(X)~\operatorname{Pr}(N)~\operatorname{Pr}(O)},$$
where here (as above) juxtaposition means event-intersection (i.e. ""the probability of all of these together"" / ""given all of these together""). This scares me somewhat: symmetries in such random variables would seem to indicate that we are in some sort of deeply unusual situation, and the resulting formulas stemming from this approximation are then likely total bunk in the real world! So I need insight on any of the following mostly-equivalent questions: How safe is $\operatorname{Pr}(N|XO) \approx \operatorname{Pr}(N|X)$ when you are already trying to control $N$ to ensure that $\operatorname{Pr}(N | O) \approx \operatorname{Pr}(N)$? Is there a nice interpretation of the above symmetric formula? Does this somehow force any really bad results like $\operatorname{Pr}(X|NO) = \operatorname{Pr}(X)$ when you follow the logic out? There would be other results that might help too, like if $\operatorname{Pr}(N|XO)$ could be phrased as some monotonic function $f\big(\operatorname{Pr}(N|X), \operatorname{Pr(N)}, \operatorname{Pr(O)}\big),$ that might be sufficient to say ""these are in a one-to-one relationship with the true probability, I just don't know what that relationship is"" and save the system.","['independence', 'bayesian', 'naive-bayes', 'probability', 'random-variables']"
1587261,Relation between partitions and saturation (quotient spaces),"A lot of books seem to define quotient topologies in terms of equivalence classes and partitions of the space. However, Munkres does not. He defines the quotient map in terms strong continuity. Also, he defines it in terms of saturated sets. That is, a continuous map is a quotient map if it maps saturated open sets to open sets. The definition of saturation is, according to Munkres, that a subset C of X is saturated if it contains every $p^{-1}(y)$ that is intersects. However, I have also seen a saturated set being defined as the union of elements of a partition (Elementary Topology by Viro et al.). So, my questions is, what is the relation between the concepts or partitions and saturation? It seems intuitive that partitions will give you saturated sets. However, does every continuous saturated map induce a partition? The main question here is, are these different definitions of a quotient space equivalent? If yes, where can I find a proof? If no, what is a counter-example?",['general-topology']
1587269,How to interpret a line equation in 4-point geometry (affine plane of order 2).,"I am currently reading ""Basic Notions of Algebra"" by Igor Shafarevich. In the first chapter example of a coordinatization of 4-point geometry is given. Set of axioms: Through any two distinct points there is one and only one line. Given any line and a point not on it, there exists one and only one other line through the point and not intersecting the line (that is, parallel to it). There exist three points not on any line. In this geometry we have 4 points A, B, C, D and 6 lines AB, CD; AD, BC; AC, BD. The families of parallel lines are separated by semicolons. Let $\Bbb{0,1}$ be symbols with operations $+$ and $\times$ such that
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\text{+} & 0 & 1\\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1\\

1 & 0 & 1\\
\end{array}

$$ The pair of quantities 0 and 1 with operations defined on them as above serve us in coordinatising the ""geometry"". For this, we give points coordinates (X, Y) as follows: A = (0, 0), B = (0, 1), C = (1, 0), D = (1, 1). It is easy to check that the lines of the geometry are then defined by the linear equations:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
& AB: 1X = 0;      & CD: 1X = 1; & AD: 1X + 1Y = 0;\\
& BC: 1X + 1Y = 1; & AC: 1Y = 0; & BD: 1Y = 1;\\

1587303,"Picking two random real numbers between 0 and 1, why isn't the probability that the first is greater than the second exactly 50%?","I attempted to answer this question on Quora, and was told that I am thinking about the problem incorrectly. The question was: Two distinct real numbers between 0 and 1 are written on two sheets of
  paper. You have to select one of the sheets randomly and declare
  whether the number you see is the biggest or smallest of the two. How
  can one expect to be correct more than half the times you play this
  game? My answer was that it was impossible, as the probability should always be 50% for the following reason: You can't! Here's why: The set of real numbers between (0, 1) is known as an Uncountably Infinite Set
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set ). A set that is
  uncountable has the following interesting property: Let $\mathbb{S}$ be an uncountably infinite set. Let, $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{S} (a \neq b, c \neq d)$. If $x$ is an uncountably infinite subset of
  $\mathbb{S}$, containing all elements in $\mathbb{S}$ on the interval $(a, b)$; and $y$
  is another uncountably infinite subset of $\mathbb{S}$, which contains all
  elements of $\mathbb{S}$ on the interval $(c, d),$ $x$ and $y$ have the same
  cardinality (size)! So for example, the set of all real numbers between (0, 1) is actually
  the exact same size as the set of all real numbers between (0, 2)!
  It is also the same size as the set of all real numbers between (0,
  0.00001). In fact, if you have an uncountably infinite set on the interval $(a, b)$, and $a<n<b$, then then exactly 50% of the numbers
  in the set are greater than $n$, and 50% are less than $n$, no matter
  what you choose for $n$. This is important because it tells us
  something unintuitive about our probability in this case.  Let's say
  the first number you picked is 0.03. You might think ""Well, 97% of the
  other possible numbers are larger than this, so the other number is
  probably larger."" You would be wrong! There are actually exactly as many numbers between (0, 0.03) as there are between (0.03, 1). Even
  if you picked 0.03, half of the other possible numbers are smaller
  than it, and half of the other possible numbers are larger than it. This means there is still a 50% probability that the other number is larger, and a 50% probability that it is smaller! "" But how can that be? "" you ask, "" why isn't $\frac{a-b}{2}$ the
  midpoint? "" The real question is, why is it that we believe that
  $\frac{a-b}{2}$ is the midpoint to begin with? The reason is probably
  the following: it seems to make the most sense for discrete
  (finite/countably infinite) sets. For example, if instead of the real
  numbers, we took the set of all multiples of $0.001$ on the interval
  $[0, 1]$. Now it makes sense to say that 0.5 is the midpoint, as we
  know that the number of numbers below 0.5 is equal to the number of
  numbers above 0.5. If we were to try to say that the midpoint is 0.4,
  we would find that there are now more numbers above 0.4 then there are
  below 0.4. This no longer applies when talking about the set of all
  real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Strangely enough, we can no longer talk
  about having a midpoint in $\mathbb{R}$, because every number in
  $\mathbb{R}$ could be considered a midpoint. For any point in
  $\mathbb{R}$, the numbers above it and the numbers below it always
  have the same cardinality. See the Wikipedia article on Cardinality of the continuum
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum ). My question is, from a mathematical point of view, is this correct? The person who told me that this is wrong is fairly well known, and not someone who I would assume to often be wrong, especially for these types of problems. The reasoning given for my answer being wrong was as follows: Your conclusion is not correct. You're right that the set of real
  numbers between 0 and 1 is uncountable infinite, and most of what you
  said here is correct. But that last part is incorrect. If you picked a
  random real number between 0 and 1, the number does have a 97% chance
  of being above 0.03. Let's look at this another way. Let K = {all
  integers divisible by 125423423}. Let M = {all integers not divisible
  by 125423423}. K and M are the same size, right? Does this mean, if
  you picked an random integer, it has a 50% chance of being in K and a
  50% chance or not? A random integer has a 50% chance of being
  divisible by 125423423? The reason I disagreed with this response was because the last sentence should actually be true. If the set of all numbers that are divisible by 125423423 is the same size as the set of numbers that aren't, there should be a 50% probability of picking a random number from the first set, and a 50% chance that a number would be picked from the second. This is cirtainly the case with finite sets. If there are 2 disjoint, finite sets with equal cardinality, and you choose a random number from the union of the two sets, there should be a 50% chance that the number came from the first set, and a 50% chance that the number came from the second set. Can this idea be generalized for infinite sets of equal cardinality? Is my answer wrong? If so, am I missing something about how cardinalities of two set relate to the probability of choosing a number from one of them? Where did I go wrong in my logic?","['real-numbers', 'probability']"

1587311,Why does the taylor expansion of a nonlinear system of differential equations exist if it has continuous second order partial derivatives?,"My textbook states that for a nonlinear autonomous system
$$x^\prime = F(x,y)\qquad y^\prime = G(x,y)$$ The system is locally linear in the neighborhood of a critical point $(x_0,y_0)$ whenever the functions $F$ and $G$ have continuous partial derivatives up to order two. To show this , we use Taylor expansions about the point $(x_0,y_0)$ to write $F(x,y)$ and $G(x,y)$ in the form
  $$F(x,y)=F(x_0,y_0)+F_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+F_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)+\eta_1(x,y)\\
G(x,y)=G(x_0,y_0)+G_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+G_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)+\eta_2(x,y)$$
  where $\eta_1(x,y)/[(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2]^{1/2}\to 0$ as $(x,y)\to(x_0,y_0)$, and similarly for $\eta_2$. By locally linear, the book means that the nonlinear system of differential equations around the critical point can be approximated by the linear system
$$\mathbf{u}^\prime=\left(
\begin{array}{@{}cc@{}}
F_x(x_0,y_0)&F_y(x_0,y_0)\\
G_x(x_0,y_0)&G_y(x_0,y_0)
\end{array}
\right)\mathbf{u}$$
where $\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^0$. The critical point $\mathbf{x}^0=(x_0,y_0)$ is an isolated critical point where
$$F(x_0,y_0)=0\quad G(x_0,y_0)=0\\

1587355,Exterior Differential (and its Equivalent Differential Operator) of an Integral 0-Form,"I am reading Witten's 1982 paper ""Supersymmetry and Morse Theory,"" and while I am slowly learning the material as I read through the paper, I have come across an equivalence that, while it should be rather basic, I can't seem to show rigorously. In the paper, Witten defines a (modified) exterior derivative $\text{d}_t$ as $$\text{d}_t = \text{d} + t\, \text{d} h$$ where $$h(\phi) = \int_S W(\phi(x)) \, \text{d}x,$$ the region $S$ is a circle with circumference $L$ and $\phi$ is a real-valued function from $S$ to the reals, i.e. $\phi: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Now, I am having trouble proving to myself that this exterior derivative $\text{d}_t$ is equivalent to the standard differential operator $$\frac{d}{d \phi} + t L \frac{dW}{d\phi}$$ acting on real-valued functions of the variable $\phi$. Now, as far as I can tell, Witten is making the identification $d \leftrightarrow \frac{d}{d \phi}$ here for this equivalency. However, given that, I can't seem to get the remaining term $t L \frac{dW}{d\phi}$. My attempt: We make the identification $\text{d} \leftrightarrow \frac{d}{d\phi}$, so the last term in the expression for $\text{d}_t$ is simply $\frac{dh}{d \phi}$. So, it should be as simple as evaluating $$\frac{d}{d\phi} \int_S W(\phi(x)) \, \text{d}x.$$ However, in evaluating this, the trouble I am running in to is that $\phi$ is an arbitrary function that is not necessarily invertible, so I cannot just rewrite the integral as an integral over $\phi$. I have also tried using the mechanics of exterior derivatives first, but then I run into the issue of evaluating $$\text{d} \int_S W(\phi(x)) \, \text{d}x,$$ which I'm not so sure where to begin (the exterior derivative is defined on the real line, not on $S$). Possibly, we can commute the derivative, which leaves us with $$\int_S \text{d} (W(\phi(x)) \, \text{d}x).$$ Then, using one of the identities of the exterior derivative yields $$\int_S \text{d} (W(\phi(x))) \land \text{d}x,$$ at which point I think the correct next step would be $$\int_S \frac{dW}{d\phi} \,\text{d} \phi \land \text{d}x.$$ From here, though, it's not quite clear what to do. Do we integrate over the region $S$, taking the integrand (a 2-form) to a 1-form? If so, this leads me to conclude that the result be (something like) $$L \frac{dW}{d\phi} \, \text{d} \phi,$$ which, with the identification, would be $$L \frac{dW}{d\phi} \frac{d}{d\phi},$$ not what we expected.

1587363,What does a one-to-one mapping say about the cardinality of the reals if it isn't onto?,"Cantor had shown that for any two subsets containing all numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ on any two intervals, they must have equal cardinalities because one can find a bijective function. The famous example is that the cardinality on the set of Reals in $[0, 1]$ is equal to the cardinality on the set of Reals on $[0, 2]$. The bijection for the two sets is to simply multiply any $x$ in the first set by 2, and you have found a bijection. Define $\mathbb{A} = \{x\in\mathbb{R}: 0 \leq x \leq 1\}$ and define $\mathbb{B} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: 0 \leq x \leq 2\}$, then our function is simply $f: x \mapsto 2x$. What bugs me about this is that you can also find a mapping such that it is injective, but not surjective. We simply define our function as $f: x \mapsto x$. This function maps every element $\mathbb{A}$ to an element in $\mathbb{B}$, but there are still elements left over in $\mathbb{B}$ that don't have an element in $\mathbb{A}$ mapping to it. For finite sets, this would usually imply that $|\mathbb{B}| > |\mathbb{A}|$, ($\mathbb{B}$ is strictly larger than $\mathbb{A}$) but this doesn't seem to be the case for infinite sets. The argument for finite sets can be easily explained as a way to count without numbers. For example, if you and I have a bunch of rocks, and you want to see who has more, you can line them up, and see who has left over at the end. In the analogy, if I all of my rocks have a unique rock from your set next to it, the mapping is injective. If all of your rocks have a unique rock from my set of rocks next to it, the function is surjective. If both are true, the function is bijective. If all of mine have a unique rock from your set next to it, but I have some left over, I have more. If all of your rocks have a unique rock from my set next to it, but you have left over, you have more. If there are none left over on either side, they are equal.

1587382,Fast convergence in $L^1$ implies convergence almost everywhere,"This is a proof-verification request. Claim: Let $(X,\mathscr M,\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $f_n$ ($n\in\mathbb N$) and $f$ be measurable, integrable, real-valued functions such that $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ converges to $f$ in $L^1$ at a rate $O(1/n^p)$, where $p>1$. Then, $f_n\to f$ almost everywhere. Note: If no assumption is made on the rate of convergence, then the best one can establish is the existence of a $\textit{sub}$sequence $(f_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}$ converging to $f$ almost everywhere (Corollary 2.32 in Folland, 1999 ). Proof of the Claim: Suppose there exists $M>0$ such that $\int|f_n-f|\,\mathrm d\mu\leq M/n^p$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$. For each $\varepsilon>0$ and $n\in\mathbb N$, let $$E(n,\varepsilon)\equiv \big\{x\in X\,\big|\,|f_n(x)-f(x)|\geq\varepsilon\big\}.$$ Then, $$\frac {M}{n^p}\geq\int|f_n-f|\,\mathrm d\mu\geq \int_{E(n,\varepsilon)}|f_n-f|\,\mathrm d\mu\geq\varepsilon\,\mu(E(n,\varepsilon))$$ for each $n\in\mathbb N$, so that $$\mu(E(n,\varepsilon))\leq\frac{M}{n^p\varepsilon}.$$ Defining $$E(\varepsilon)\equiv\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{n=m}^{\infty}E(n,\varepsilon),$$ one has that $$\mu(E(\varepsilon))\underset{\forall m\in\mathbb N}{\leq}\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=m}^{\infty}E(n,\varepsilon)\right)\leq\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}\mu(E(n,\varepsilon))\leq\frac{M}{\varepsilon}\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^p}\to0\quad\text{as $m\to\infty$},$$
since the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^{p}=\zeta(p)$ converges. Therefore, $\mu(E(\varepsilon))=0$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, which implies also that $$\mu\left(\bigcup_{q\in\mathbb Q\cap(0,\infty)}E(q)\right)=0.$$ Now, if $x\in X$ is such that $f_n(x)\not\to f(x)$, then there exists some $q>0$ such that $q\in\mathbb Q$ and for each $m\in\mathbb N$, there exists some $n\geq m$ so that $|f_n(x)-f(x)|\geq q$. That is, $x\in E(q)$. Hence, the set where pointwise convergence fails is a subset of $\bigcup_{q\in\mathbb Q\cap(0,\infty)}E(q)$, completing the proof. $\quad\blacksquare$","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

I need to evaluate the path integral around the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$: $$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{|dz|}{|az-1|^2}$$ where $|dz|$ represents integration with respect to arc-length. My solution is following: Since $z$ is the unit circle, we can rewrite it as $z=x+iy=e^{it}$ with $x=\cos t$ and $y=\sin t$. Hence, $|dz|=dt$ after the required transformations. Also, if $a=re^{i\varphi} (r>1)$, we have:
$$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{|dz|}{|az-1|^2}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{dt}{|re^{i(t+\varphi)}-1|^2}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{dt}{(r\cos (t+\varphi)-1)^2+r^2\sin (t+\varphi)^2}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{dt}{r^2+1-2r\cos (t+\varphi)}$$ and then I can try to find out the integral, but it is a little bit challenging.

1587415,Bijective correspondence of rational points in projective space,"Let $k$ be a field and consider an arbitrary point $\alpha = (\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \mathbf{P}(k^{n+1})$. Then there is a bijection $\rho: \mathbf{P}(k^{n+1}) \to \mathbf{P}_k^n (k)$, the latter denoting the set of rational points of $\mathbf{P}_k^n$, where $\rho (\alpha)$ is the ideal generated by $\alpha_j T_i - \alpha_i T_j, 0\le i,j \le n$. I am interested in only surjectivity. Fact: The set of rational points for a scheme $X$ over a field $k$, $X(k)$ can be identified with $x \in X$ such that $k(x) = k$, where $k(x)$ is the residue field at x. In the proof, we will use the above fact without proof or mention. Let $x \in \mathbf{P}_k^n (k)$ and WLOG, $x \in D_+ (T_0)$. Let $\alpha_i$ be the image of $T_0^{-1}T_i \in \mathcal{O}(D_+(T_0))$ in $k = k(x)$ and set $\alpha = (\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_n)$. Then $\rho (\alpha) = x$. Is WLOG because the $x \in D_+ (T_i)$ for some $i$? Why should this be the case? Edit: I wonder if we can say that since $x$ is a rational point, in particular, it is a point in $\mathbf{P}^n = \textrm{Proj } k[T_i]$, then it cannot contain all of the $T_i$ therefore, there must be some $i$ which $x \in D_+ (T_i)$? $\mathcal{O}(D_+(T_0)) = k[T_0^{-1}T_i]$. So if we say that $x$ corresponded to some $p$, then we have a natural injection $k[T_0^{-1}T_i] \to k[T_i]_{(p)} / pk[T_i]_{(p)}$ since $p \in D_+(T_0)$ so just sending $T_0^{-1}T_i$ to ""itself"" is a well-defined map and so we can take this to be $\alpha_i$? I am not sure how to now see that $\rho (\alpha) = x$. Using the above notation, it seems that $\rho (\alpha) = \alpha_j T_i + \alpha_i T_j = \overline{T_0^{-1}T_j}T_i + \overline{T_0^{-1}T_i}T_j$ but I don't see how this should relate back to $x$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'graded-rings', 'projective-space', 'proof-explanation']"

Now assume that I wanted to solve $$y'=y, \\ y(0)=1$$ using the fixed point theorem. Solving the above problem is equivalent to solving

But obviously this is not the maximal open interval on which $y=e^x$ is our solution.

Let $(X, \mathscr A, \mu)$ a finite measure space. Let $\{f_n\}$ a sequence of measurable functions such that $\|f_n\|_p\le M$ for a real constant $M$ $(1<p<\infty)$ and suppose that $f_n \xrightarrow{\text{a.e.}} f$. Then $$\int_X f_n g \,d\mu \to \int_X fg \,d\mu$$ for all $g$ in $\mathscr{L}^q (X)$, where $q^{-1}=1- p^{-1}$. Since $\int |f_n|^p \,d\mu\le M^p $ by Fatou's lemma it follows that $\int |f|^p \,d\mu\le M^p<\infty$, so $f$ belongs to $\mathscr{L}^p (X)$. Let $g$ in $\mathscr{L}^q$ arbitrary but fixed. Then by Hölder inequality it follows that $$\|f_n g\|_1 \le \|f_n\|_p\|g\|_q\le M \|g\|_q<\infty$$ and $$\|f g\|_1 \le \|f\|_p\|g\|_q \le M \|g\|_q<\infty$$ thus $f_n g$ and $fg$ belongs to $\mathscr L ^1(X)$. Now since $g$ is in $\mathscr L ^q (X)$, then $g$ is finite a.e.,without loss of generality we may assume that $g$ is real-valued so $f_n g \xrightarrow{ a.e} fg$. Let $\nu (A) =  \int_A |g|^q \,d\mu $, so $\nu $ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, also $\nu$ is a finite measure on $(X, \mathscr A )$. We can use the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of absolutely continuous, so given $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for $\mu(A)<\delta$ then $\nu (A) <\epsilon^q$ for any $A$ in $\mathscr A$. Now by Egoroff's thm exists a $B$ in $\mathscr A$ such that $(f_ng) (x)\xrightarrow{\text{uniformly}} (fg) (x)$ for $x$ in $B$ and $\mu(X\setminus B) <\delta$. Let $N$ such that for all $n\ge N$, $|(f_ng)(x)-(fg)(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x\in B$. Thus \begin{align*}\left |\int_X (f_n-f) g \, d\mu \right|&\le \int_B |f_ng-fg| \, d\mu +\int_{X-B}|f_n g|\, d\mu +\int_{X-B}|fg|\,d\mu \\[6pt]
&\le \int_B |f_ng-fg| d\mu + 2M \left( \int_{X-B}|g|^qd\mu \right)^{1/q}\\[6pt]
&\le\epsilon \mu(X)+2M  (\nu(X\setminus B))^{1/q}\\[6pt]
&\le \epsilon (\mu(X)+2M)\end{align*} Since $\mu(x)<\infty$ and $M<\infty$ the result follows.","['real-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'lp-spaces', 'integration', 'measure-theory']"

Let's focus on $\sin(x)$ . In a finite interval covering an integral number of cycles, it's obvious -- we can either throw a uniform distribution on the interval or just integrate and it'll be 0. Unfortunately there's no (proper) infinite analog to the uniform distribution, and even if we use the improper version (density = 1 everywhere), the infinite integral of $\sin(x)$ strikes me as divergent because its partial sums diverge. One workaround to this I came up with is: $$\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin(x)dx = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\intop_{2\pi k}^{2\pi(k+1)}\sin(x) dx\right)=0$$ But that strikes me as a bit fishy (e.g., we should require that the LHS exists before throwing an equals sign down, correct?).

Consider the normal lines of $\alpha$ at two neighboring points $t_1,t_2$. Let $t_1$ approach $t_2$ and show that the intersection point converges. I solved the problem and I want an opinion about it (if it is correct) and if you can find a more elegant solution.

$$d_1(\lambda)=\alpha(s_1)+\lambda n(s_1)$$ 
$$d_2(\mu)=\alpha(s_2)+\mu n(s_2)$$ 
We get the intersection point $P$ for $\lambda$ and $\mu$ that solve the equation:
$$\alpha(s_1)+\lambda n(s_1)=\alpha(s_2)+\mu n(s_2)$$ Multiplying both sides with the tangent vector $t(s_2)$ (which is normal with $n(s_2)$) we get:

1588233,Does linear regression form a subspace?,"The author writes Given a vector of inputs $X^T = (X_1, \dots ,X_p)$, we can predict an output $Y$ via $$ \hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j = 1}^p X_j \beta_j$$ He goes on to note that if we include a 1 in the vector $X$, making it a $p+1$ dimensional vector, we can write the regression as an inner product $\hat{Y} = X^T\beta$, and this is a subspace.  If the constant is not included, it forms an affine set. I'm not convinced that $X^T\beta$ forms a subspace of $X^T \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}$, mostly because $\vec{0} \not \in X^T\beta$.  Unless the author thinks that $X^T\beta$ is a subspace in beta, in which case I agree. Maybe someone could clarify for me.

1588257,Oscillations of $x^{1/x}$,"I was messing around on Wolfram|Alpha here when I happened to look at the graph of $x^{1/x}$. It appears to me that both real values and imaginary values oscillate between $\pm\infty$ near $x=0$ from the left side. It also seems as though the graph is perfectly stable for $x>0$. The graph also seems perfectly stable around $x<-0.5$ or something. What could explain this odd behavior? And what determines if something is oscillating?  I can clearly tell it is oscillating by the graph, but is there a sort of definition that I can use to determine where the function stops oscillating and stabilizes?

1588314,"""Localizing"" commutative pointed monoids","A pointed monoid is a commutative monoid $A$ with a distinguished element $0\in A$ such that $0\cdot A=0$.  Morphisms should preserve $0$. If $A$ is a commutative ring or pointed monoid, and $f\in A$, there is a localization $A\to A_f$ that is initial with respect to the following property: every map $\phi:A_f\to B$ into a nontrivial ring/pointed monoid $B$ has $\phi(f)\neq 0$. For both rings and monoids, we get this localization by formally adjoining $f^{-1}$. What if we have two elements, $f,g\in A$, and we want to study maps $\varphi: A\to B$ into a nontrivial objects $B$ such that $\varphi(f)\neq\varphi(g)$?  Is there a localization $A_{(f,g)}$ with a similar universal property? For rings, the answer is clear: we can define $A_{(f,g)} = A_{f-g}$.  But is there a more complicated construction that works for monoids? For example, if $fh=gh$ in $A$, then $h$ should most likely be nilpotent in $A_{f,g}$.","['localization', 'abstract-algebra', 'monoid', 'commutative-algebra']"
