2886764,Support of structure sheaf,"If $X$ is a scheme and $Z$ is the closed subvariety, how to compute support of $O_Z$ on $X$? I think it is just $Z$, but now I am not sure! Example: $X = Spec(R)$, $I \subset R$, $Z = Spec(R/I)$. Then $Ann_R(R/I) = I$ I think, so $Supp(i_*O_Z) = V(I) = Z$. Am I'm wrong? I read that we can not always find the coherent sheaf $F$ on $Z$ such that $Supp(F) = Z$. That's why I'm confused.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'commutative-algebra']"
2886810,Evaluation of $\int_{0}^{\pi /2\;}{\frac{\cos \left( A\cos t \right)}{{{a}^{2}}{{\sin }^{2}}t+{{b}^{2}}{{\cos }^{2}}t}dt}$,"I have been chatting with @user3321 about the evaluation of: ($a>0,b>0$, $A$ is real) $$I\left( A \right)=\int_{0}^{\pi /2\;}{\frac{\cos \left( A\cos \left( t \right) \right)}{{{a}^{2}}{{\sin }^{2}}\left( t \right)+{{b}^{2}}{{\cos }^{2}}\left( t \right)}dt}$$ differentiating $I\left( A \right)$ with respect to $A$ n-th times gives:
$${{I}^{\left( n \right)}}\left( A \right)=\int_{0}^{{\pi }/{2}\;}{\frac{{{\cos }^{n}}\left( t \right)\cos \left( {n\pi }/{2}\;+A\cos \left( t \right) \right)}{{{a}^{2}}{{\sin }^{2}}\left( t \right)+{{b}^{2}}{{\cos }^{2}}\left( t \right)}dt}$$ So it is easily seen that ${{I}^{\left( n \right)}}\left( 0 \right)=0$ if $n=1,2,3,...$, and
$${{I}^{\left( n \right)}}\left( 0 \right)={{\left( -1 \right)}^{\frac{n}{2}}}\int_{0}^{\pi /2\;}{\frac{{{\cos }^{n}}\left( t \right)}{{{a}^{2}}{{\sin }^{2}}\left( t \right)+{{b}^{2}}{{\cos }^{2}}\left( t \right)}dt,\quad if\quad n=0,2,4,...}$$
Now if i assume that $I\left( A \right)$ has a Maclaurin series representation( i am not sure if it is valid ), then 
$$I\left( A \right)=\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac{{{I}^{\left( 2m \right)}}\left( 0 \right)}{\left( 2m \right)!}{{A}^{2m}}}$$
Where it can be shown(using for example a CAS) that:
$${{I}^{\left( 2m \right)}}\left( 0 \right)={{\left( -1 \right)}^{m+1}}\frac{\sqrt{\pi }\,\Gamma \left( \frac{1}{2}+m \right){}_{2}{{F}_{1}}(\frac{1}{2},1,1+m,1-\frac{{{a}^{2}}}{{{b}^{2}}})}{2{{b}^{2}}m!}$$
Finally,
$$\begin{align}
  & I\left( A \right)=\sum\nolimits_{m=0}^{\infty }{\frac{{{\left( -1 \right)}^{m+1}}\sqrt{\pi }\,\Gamma \left( \frac{1}{2}+m \right){}_{2}{{F}_{1}}(\frac{1}{2},1,1+m,1-\frac{{{a}^{2}}}{{{b}^{2}}})}{2{{b}^{2}}m!\left( 2m \right)!}{{A}^{2m}}} \\

2886831,Does knowledge of all the geodesics suffice to determine the metric up to a scaling factor?,"Does knowledge of all the geodesics of a Riemannian manifold suffice to determine the metric up to a scaling factor? The metric completely characterizes the shape of a Riemannian manifold. However, knowledge of all the geodesics on a Riemannian manifold does not uniquely determine the metric. This problem is a case of obtaining local properties from global ones. The metric is a local quantity; it depends only on the chosen point of the manifold and a local neighborhood around it. Geodesics, on the other hand, connect points on the manifold, appealing to a larger global structure of the manifold. There are a variety of theorems dealing with the relationship between local and global properties in Riemannian geometry, a prolific example of which is the Hopf-Rinow theorem. This tells you that a Riemannian manifold is a complete metric space if and only if it is geodesically complete - that is, if at any point you can extend a geodesic infinitely far in any direction, the metric on a space is such that the manifold is complete. We can deduce a few interesting properties like this, but we cannot fully determine the metric from information about the geodesics. So we can't fully determine the metric from information about the geodesics, but can we determine the metric up to a scaling factor from the geodesics?","['general-relativity', 'differential-geometry']"
2886856,"Differentials of non-smooth functions, wedge products of currents?","In a paper of McMullen he considers foliations on a manifold determined by a closed 1-form $\rho$.  He says an $L^\infty$ function $f$ is constant on the leaves of the foliation if ""$df \wedge \rho = 0$ as a current,"" and I'm having a hard time unwinding exactly what's happening with the currents (which I'm not very familiar with). My understanding is that currents are functionals on differential forms, and given a function $f$ we can define a current on $n$-forms (for an $n$-dimensional manifold) by integrating $f$ times the $n$-form.  Similarly, the 1-form $\rho$ defines a current on the $(n-1)$-forms by integrating the wedge of the form with $\rho$.  But what's going on with $df \wedge \rho$?  I get that we can define a differential of a current by $[dT](\omega) = T(d\omega)$, so I guess $df$ refers to the current on $n-1$ forms which sends $\omega \mapsto \int f d\omega$, but how is the wedge with $\rho$ defined? My only guess is that $df \wedge \rho$ is a current acting on $(n-2)$ forms sending $\omega \mapsto \int f \cdot (d\omega \wedge \rho)$.  Even if that's correct, why does $f$ being constant on leaves imply this current is zero?  It seems strange to me that functions constant on the leaves of the foliation determined by $\rho$, which have codimension $1$, can be expressed in terms of $n-2$ forms.","['foliations', 'distribution-theory', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"
2886929,"For $x'(t)= f(t, x(t)) + \int_0^t g(x(s))\, ds$ show that if $x_1(0) \leq x_2(0)$ that also $x_1(t) \leq x_2(t)$","Note The Question has changed significantly since it was posed, but it is now as follows: Question Suppose we have some integro or delayed differential equation:
$$
x'(t)=f(t,x(t)) + \int_0^t g(x(s))\, ds + \sum_n h(x(t-a_n)),
$$
where we assume that conditions are satisfied such that this equation always has a unique, continuous solution.
let $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be two solutions with some boundary conditions $x_1(0)=x_1$ and $x_2(0)=x_2$ such that $x_1 \leq x_2$. I would now like to show that we have for all $t: x_1(t) \leq x_2(t)$. What are some methods for showing this? I know of the following method: Suppose there is some $t>0$ such that $x_1(t) > x_2(t)$, then there exists a value $s \in [0,t]$ such that $x_1(s)=x_2(s)$ and for all $u\leq s: x_1(u) \leq x_2(u)$. If one can show under these conditions that $x_1'(t) = f(t,x_1(t)) \leq f(t,x_2(t)) = x_2'(t)$ then it follows that $x_1(t)$ stays below $x_2(t)$ for all $t$. Write $x(t) = \int_0^t f(s,x(s))\, ds$ and show that $\int_0^t f(s,x_1(s))\, ds \leq \int_0^t f(s,x_2(s))\, ds$ for all $t$. The first method is easy to apply but too restrictive and the second method is not restrictive at all but is hard to apply. My question is a reference or an explenation of other methods in case the first method is not applicable. An Example Suppose for example we have the following Delay Differential Equation:
$$
\begin{cases}
x'(t) &= x(t)-1 \mbox{ if } t \leq 1\\
x'(t) &= x(t-1) (x(t) - x(t-1)) \mbox{ if } t >1
\end{cases}
$$
this delay differential equation satisfies the property that if we have $x_1,x_2 \in (0.8,1)$ with $x_1 \leq x_2$ and $x_1(t), x_2(t)$ are solutions satisfying $x_i(0) = x_i$ then for all $t: x_1(t) \leq x_2(t)$. I can check this numerically but not analytically.","['calculus', 'integro-differential-equations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"
2886939,Strange functional equation: $f(x)+f(\cos(x))=x$,"BACKGROUND: A while ago, I became obsessed for a period of time with the following functional equation:
$$f(x)+f(\cos(x))=x$$
I am only considering the unique real analytic solution to this functional equation (it is indeed unique... all derivatives of $f$ at $w\approx 0.739$, the Dottie Number , can be determined by differentiating this equation repeatedly). Here is a graph of the function: I had already given up a long time ago when I accidentally came across my notes on this problem today, and I figured I would put it one MSE to see if anyone could find anything interesting that I missed. WHAT I FOUND: I am almost absolutely certain that there is no nice closed-form for this function, so I resorted to finding special values and other neater functional equations. So far, I have found the following special values of $f$ and its derivatives:
$$f(w)=w/2$$
$$f'(w)=\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{1-w^2}}$$
$$f''(w)=\frac{1}{2-w^2}\frac{w}{1-\sqrt{1-w^2}}$$
$$f'(0)=1$$
$$f'(\pi/2)=2$$
$$f'(-\pi/2)=0$$
Here are some functional equations I have found for $f$:
$$f(x+2\pi)-f(x)=2\pi$$
$$f(x+\pi)-f(x)=2\cos(x)+\pi$$
$$f(x)-f(-x)=2x$$
And here is a series representation for $f$, where $\cos^{\circ n}$ represents the cosine function composed $n$ times:
$$f(x)=\frac{w}{2}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty \big(\cos^{\circ 2n}(x)-\cos^{\circ 2n+1}(x)\big)$$ QUESTIONS: This is a very open-ended question. I have a few unproven conjectures or particular unanswered questions about this function, but I really just want to see what interesting properties (especially special values, zeroes, maxima or minima, inflection points, and functional or differential equations) people can find. An example of one of my conjectures: by looking at graphs, I have conjectured that $f(x+a)-f(x)$ is a sinusoid or a sum of sinusoids for all $a$. It is easy to show that this must be periodic, but I would like to prove or disprove that it can be expressed as a sum of sinusoids. In particular, can we find an expression for $f(x+\pi/2)-f(x)$ as a sum of sinusoids, possibly involving other mathematical constants like $w$? Here is a graph of $f(x+\pi/2)-f(x)$: I appreciate any contributions!","['functional-equations', 'real-analysis']"

2886973,Why does the Gauss-Bonnet theorem seem to work for some square boundary identifications but not others?,"The Wikipedia article gives an interesting example of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem: As an application, a torus has Euler characteristic 0, so its total curvature must also be zero. ... It is also possible to construct a torus by identifying opposite sides of a square, in which case the Riemannian metric on the torus is flat and has constant curvature 0, again resulting in total curvature 0. But there are of course other ways of closing up the square by identifying points on its boundary. If we identify opposite sides with one pair's orientation flipped, we get the Klein bottle, which also has Euler characteristic 0. But if we flip both pair's orientations then we get the real projective plane, which has Euler characteristic 1. And if we identify the entire boundary together then we get the sphere, with Euler characteristic 2. These are all closed surfaces so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem would naively imply that their total curvature equals $2\pi$ times their Euler characteristic, but this only works for the torus and Klein bottle identifications, but not the real projective plane or sphere identifications. Why? For concreteness, consider the manifold $M$, the closed square (or unit disk) quotiented by its boundary. I think that $M$ has the topological structure of $S^2$ but not the differential structure - i.e. it's homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to $S^2$. Is this correct? But $M$ can't be an exotic sphere because they don't exist in two dimensions, so it must not be a differentiable manifold at all. If I'm correct, then the identification process means that $M$ is not actually differentiable at the point which is the identified boundary - it's perfectly homogenous as a topological manifold, but fails to be a differentiable manifold because there's one problematic point at which the Gaussian curvature is undefined. Similarly, I guess the identified-edge square is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the real projective plane? Then are the squares with the torus and Klein bottle identifications differentiable at the identified edges and corners? If so, why are the torus- and Klein-bottle-identified squares differentiable at their boundary but not the RPP- and sphere-identified squares?","['differential-geometry', 'surfaces', 'general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'projective-space']"

2887131,Derivative of inverse function proof verification,"Can someone verify whether my attempt to prove this theorem is correct? Notice that I use a generalized definition of derivative: Let $f: E \subseteq \mathbb{R}  \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. Let $p$ both a point and a limit point of $E$. Then we define the derivative of $f$ at $p$ as the limit $f'(p) = \lim_{x \to p, x \in E \setminus \{p\}} \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}$, provided the limit exists. Theorem : Let $f: E \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an invertible function that is differentiable at $p \in
 E$. Suppose that $f^{-1}: F \to E$ is continuous at $f(p)$ and that
  $f'(p) \neq 0$. Then $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at $f(p)$, and we have $$(f^{-1})'(f(p)) = \frac{1}{f'(p)}$$ Proof : Before proving the theorem, we have to check that differentiation at $f(p)$ makes sense: we have to show that $f(p)$ is a limit point of $Y$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Because $f$ is differentiable at $p$, $f$ is continuous at $p$ and it follows that $|f(p)-f(x)| < \epsilon$ whenever $x \in (p- \delta, p + \delta) \cap E \setminus \{p\}$ for some $\delta > 0$. Notice: $f'(p) \neq 0$ implies that $f$ is not constant on $(p- \delta, p + \delta) \cap E \setminus \{p\}$ (if it were constant, we would have $f'(p) = \lim_{x \to p} \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} = \lim_{x \to p, x \in E \cap (p- \delta, p + \delta)\setminus \{p\}}\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} = 0)$. Combining these facts, we deduce that $0 < |f(x)-f(p)| < \epsilon$ for some $x \in E$, and $f(p)$ is a limit point of $F = f(E)$. Define $$F: E \to \mathbb{R}: x \mapsto \begin{cases} \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} \quad x \neq p \\ f'(p) \quad x = p\end{cases}$$ Clearly, $F$ is continuous at $p$. The theorem now follows from the following easy calculation: $$(f^{-1})'(f(p)) = \lim_{y \to f(p)} \frac{f^{-1}(y)- f^{-1}(f(p))}{y-f(p)}$$ $$= \lim_{y \to f(p)}\frac{1}{\frac{f(f^{-1}(y))-f(p)}{f^{-1}(y)- p}}$$ $$ = \lim_{y \to f(p)} \frac{1}{F(f^{-1}(y))}$$ $$=  \frac{1}{F( \lim_{y \to f(p)} f^{-1}(y))} =  \frac{1}{F(p)} = \frac{1}{f'(p)}$$ However, some equalities need some explanation. The second equality is justified by noticing that $f^{-1}(y) - p = f^{-1}(y) - f^{-1}(f(p))$ is zero only when $y = f(p)$, so there are no trouble with dividing by zero. The fourth equality uses the continuity of $F$ at $p$ and the fifth equality follows from the continuity of $f^{-1}$ at $f(p) \quad \square$","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'limits', 'derivatives']"
2887166,In which sense are the Cauchy-Riemann equations elliptic,"I often read that the rigidity and smoothness properties of holomorphic functions can be explained by the fact that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are elliptic.
In which sense is that true? Obviously they are not elliptic in the sense of the Wikipedia definition or that of Lecture notes of Ambrosio, both of which are restricted to second order PDE. There is also a definition of hypoellipticity out there that is simply based on smoothness of solutions. That one would hardly be useful to make sense of how ellipticity explains smoothness properties of holomorphic functions. It remains the definition of elliptic equations as those with definite principal symbol. However, I don't believe the CR equations can be reasonably be classified as elliptic under this definition. Of course we can say that the symbol of the Cauchy-Riemann operator $\partial_x+i\partial_y$ is $x+iy$ for $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$. If that's it, I already have my answer, because the last expression is definite. However, I feel like this would be cheating. Since the differentials $\partial_x f$ and $\partial_y f$ occuring in the Cauchy-Riemann equations are elements of $\mathbb{C}$ the variables in the symbol should probably be too, and in that case $x+iy$ can be zero even for nonzero $x$ and $y$.

These have been my ideas so far: First of all, by the first isomorphism theorem, $$R \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(y^2-x^2z).$$ The ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ then corresponds to the ideal $(x-a,y-b,z-c)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z].$ Certainly, $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by at most $3$ elements, as the images of the generators of $\mathfrak{m}$ will generate $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}.$ So we need to find $(a,b,c)$ such that $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is principal or generated by three elements. By Krull's height theorem, if $\mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}) \geq 2,$ then $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be principal, as the height of a proper ideal is bounded above by the number of generators of that ideal. Furthermore, $\mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}) = \mathrm{ht}(\mathfrak{m})$ as the localisation gives us a bijection between prime ideals of $R$ contained in $\mathfrak{m}$ and prime ideals of $R_\mathfrak{m}.$ As commented above, $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponds to the ideal $(x-a,y-b,z-c)$ in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z],$ so we need to consider the prime ideals $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ such that $(y^2-x^2z) \subseteq \mathfrak{p} \subseteq (x-a,y-b,z-c).$ For example, if we consider $(a,b,c) = (0,0,0),$ we would have the following chain of ideals in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]:$ $$(y^2-x^2z) \subsetneq (x,y) \subsetneq (x,y,z),$$ so $(x,y,z)$ has height at least $2$ , hence the corresponding maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ cannot be principal. However, this method still doesn't allow me to decide whether $(x,y,z)$ has two or three generators in the localisation. Also, for $(a,b,c) \neq (0,0,0),$ I'm not sure how to find the height of the ideal $(s-a,st-b,t^2-c).$ Of course, I'm not even sure if this method is the correct method (as the height only gives the lower bound for the number of generators). If anybody has better ideas or any hints, it'd be much appreciated! EDIT: I realised I can actually show that all the prime ideals of $\mathbb{C}[s,t]$ are generated by at most $2$ elements, so $\mathfrak{m}$ is generated by at most two elements. So I guess this means we just need to decide whether $\mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ is principal or not? EDIT2: Actually, a prime ideal in $R$ isn't necessarily prime in $\mathbb{C}[s,t],$ so I guess the above doesn't quite work. EDIT3: I feel like I have a possible solution. It'd be great if somebody could check them! Possible solution: Let $d$ be the minimal number of generators of $\mathfrak{n} = \mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}.$ Then by Nakayama's Lemma, $d$ is also the minimal number of generators of $\mathfrak{n}/\mathfrak{n}^2.$ So $d = \dim_{R/\mathfrak{m}}\mathfrak{n}/\mathfrak{n}^2.$ Note that the image of $\{x-a,y-b,z-c\}$ in $R_\mathfrak{m}$ generate $\mathfrak{n},$ so $\{(x-a)^2,(y-b^2),(z-c)^2,(x-a)(y-b),(y-b)(z-c),(z-c)(x-a)\}$ generate $\mathfrak{n}^2.$ I'm going to try to show that $d=3.$ Suppose $u(x-a)+v(y-b)+w(z-c) \in \mathfrak{n}^2$ for $u,v,w\in R/\mathfrak{m} \cong \mathbb{C}.$ The equation above is linear, so we cannot have the square generators (such as $(x-a)^2$ ). But every other generator contains $xy$ , $yz$ , or $zx,$ which isn't possible. So $u=v=w=0.$ So the three generators (modulo $\mathfrak{n}^2$ ) are linearly independent, hence $d=3$ . So no choice of $(a,b,c)$ works.","['localization', 'algebraic-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

My best attempt was: $$ I_\phi(x,y,u,\theta)=\frac{2}{B}\left[B\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)F_1\left(\frac{1}{2},1,-;1;\nu,-\frac{a}{2}\right)-aB\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)F_1\left(\frac{3}{2},1,-;2;\nu,-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right], $$ where $B=x^2\sin^2\theta+x^2y^2\cos^2\theta$, $a=u^2\sin^2\theta$, and $\nu=\frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+x^2y^2\cot^2\theta}$. In this way, the final results it's something like that: $$ I= \int_{0}^{\pi} \mathrm d \theta~3x^2y^2\sin\theta \cos^2\theta~ I_\phi(x,y,u,\theta). \tag{3}. $$ Eq. $(3)$ cannot be further simplied in general and is the nal result. Second attempt: To avoid the hypergeometric function $F_1$, I tried to start with the $\phi$ integral. In this case, my initial problem is an integral something like that: $$ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \mathrm d \phi \frac{\cos(A \cos\phi)}{a^2\cos^2\phi+b^2\sin^2\phi}. \tag{4}  $$ This integral $(4)$ can be solved by series (see Vincent's answer and Jack's answer). However those solutions, at least for me, has not a closed form. This is my final step on this second attempt :( What is the point? It turns out that someone has managed to solve the integral $(1)$, at least the integral in $r$ and $\phi$.

Edit Since my question was not solved yet, I think  it is because it is a tough question, I will show a particular case of the integral $I$, letting $u=0$. I hope with this help you help me. In this case, the $r$ integral in $(1)$ is trivial and the integral takes the form: $$ I_P=\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta~\sin\theta\frac{3x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}{(y^2\cos\phi+x^2\sin^2\phi)\sin^2\theta+x^2y^2\cos^2\theta}. \tag{5} $$ The $\phi$ integral can be integrated with the help of Eq. 3.642.1 in Gradstein and Ryzhik's tables of integrals. Thereby, the $I_P$ takes the for: $$ I_P=3xy\int_{0}^{\pi}d\theta\frac{\sin\theta\cos^2\theta}{\sqrt{1+(x^2-1)\cos^2\theta}\sqrt{1+(y^2-1)\cos^2\theta}}. \tag{6}$$ Now the change of variable $k=\sqrt{1-x^2}\cos\theta$ bring expression $(6)$ to the form $$ I_P= \frac{(const) x~y}{(1-x^2)^{3/2}}\int_{0}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \mathrm dk \frac{k^2}{\sqrt{1-k^2}\sqrt{1-k^2\frac{1-y^2}{1-x^2}}}. $$ Did you notice how $I_G$ and $I_P$ are similar?

I was hoping to see if there are any theorems, papers, or other research materials that deal with these types of objects.  The reason for the belief is due to a Mathematica calculation that I ran that suggests this holds so long as the binomial coefficient involves multiples of $m=p^\alpha-1$. Here is the calculation. The green rows represent the values of $m$ from 2 to 30 that support the divisibility claim.  These numbers in order are $$2,3,4,6,7,8,10,12,15,16,18,22,24,26,28,30$$ and these numbers, when entered into OEIS.org return that these numbers are prime powers minus one.

I also understand that the spectral decomposition / eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors can be written as $\mathbf{A = Q \boldsymbol{\Lambda} Q^{-1}}$, where $\mathbf{Q}$ is the matrix whose $i$th column is the eigenvector $q_i$ of $\mathbf{A}$, and $\Lambda_{ii} = \lambda_i$.

$$\mathbf{A} = \sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_iq_i q_i^*,$$

Does this mean, then, that the projection operator associated with $\lambda_i$ can be related to the sum of outer products of eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue: $$ E_i = \sum_{j=1}^{r_i} q_j q_j^*,$$ where $r_i$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda_i$? And then all of the associated properties of the projection operators hold?

What has given me success in the exercises (so far), is to obtain the POSITION of the quartile with the formula $\frac{(n+1)i}{4}$, without distinguishing between odd and even data, and to obtain the VALUE of the quartile I have two options: If the position of the quartile is a decimal, the VALUE will be the average between the two closest integers. If the position of the quartile is an INTEGER, the VALUE will be the data that is in that position. And I have the same doubt, with the formulas for quintile, decile and percentile. But my recently exposed methodology has worked well for me, however I come to ask, Is the way I am getting the POSITION and VALUE of the position measurements correct or not correct at all?

2888310,Proof of Cauchy's Theorem for abelian groups,"I am reading the Dummit and Foote's proof of Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups. On the highlighted line, how do you conclude from $y\notin N$ and $y^p\in N$ that $\langle y^p \rangle \neq \langle y \rangle$ and that $|y^p|<|y|$? Proposition 21. If $G$ is a finite abelian group and $p$ is a prime dividing $|G|$, then $G$ contains an element of order $p$. Proof: The proof proceeds by induction on $|G|$, namely, we assume the result is valid for every group whose order is strictly smaller than the order of $G$ and then prove the result valid for $G$ (this is sometimes referred to as complete induction).
  Since $|G| > 1$, there is an element $x \in G$ with $x \neq 1$.
  If $|G| = p$ then $x$ has order $p$ by Lagrange’s Theorem and we are done.
  We may therefore assume $|G| > p$. Suppose $p$ divides $|x|$ and write $|x| = pn$.
  By Proposition 2.5(3), $|x^n| = p$, and again we have an element of order $p$.
  We may therefore assume $p$ does not divides $|x|$. Let $N = \langle x \rangle$.
  Since $G$ is abelian, $N \trianglelefteq G$.
  By Lagrange’s Theorem, $|G/N| = |G|/|N|$ and since $N \neq 1$, $|G/N| < |G|$.
  Since $p$ does not divide $|N|$, we must have $p \mid |G/N|$.
  We can now apply the induction assumption to the smaller group $G/N$ to conclude it contains an element $\bar{y} = yN$, of order $p$. Since $y \notin N$ ($\bar{y} \neq \bar{1}$) but $y^p \in N$ ($\bar{y}^p = \bar{1}$) we must have $\langle y^p \rangle \neq \langle y \rangle$, that is, $|y^p| < |y|$. Proposition 2.5(2) implies $p \mid |y|$.
  We are now in the situation described in the preceding paragraph, so that argument again produces an element of order $p$.

2888314,mean of a function on a topology other than R^n,"Sorry for the long post, the beginning part is mainly about the motivation for this question. At the end I give a specific problem I would like solved. I am plotting the angle of a complex function over a 2D space using colour to represent different angles. Most of my data is clustered together around a single angle with a relatively small variance. As a rough estimate, 90% of the data is within 15 degrees or so. For this reason I don't want to associate a unique colour to each of the angles in 360 degrees because most of the colours will go unused, I thus see it fit to find the ""mean"" (I concept I don't really know how to define on a circle) and then choose that angle to be associated with the colour in the middle of my colour wheel and then associate angles greater or less than the mean with colours varying on the colour wheel in such a way as to most efficiently use the colours. The main problem I have run into is calculating the mean. Imagine most of the data is clustered around 0 degrees. Then there will be about half the data just above 0 and the rest of it just below 360 because of the nature of angle. Thus the mean will be about 180. You could imagine shifting all the data points around the circle so as to cause the mean to not be near 0 degrees however this would require already knowing the mean. I have solved this problem. I imagine each data point as being a point in the plane like so. A point corresponding to the angle ø would be imagined as the point (cosø,sinø). I then take the mean of the data as it would be calculated for any data set in R 2 (I take the mean in the x and the mean in the y) then I take this new point of the form (x,y) and calculate its corresponding angle with ø = atan(y/x) there by projecting the point back into the original space. Of course this isn't perfect, say x=0, then you need to look at the sign of y and then pick 90 or 270 degrees accordingly. If y=x=0 then you can't get a value however in this case the notion of a mean doesn't really make sense in my opinion because the data is evenly spaced around the circle. Although this isn't perfect, it works for my application so I am going to leave it as it is. This now brings me to a more general question. Say you have some topology other than R n , with a distribution over it (like in my case above the topology S 1 ). How might one calculate/define the ""mean"". An easy generalization of what I did above can be done for a sphere, simply imagine the points as being in R 3 and then take the mean, then project the mean back onto the sphere. In general you could take a data set over a manifold, embed it in R n , and then project it back down onto the manifold and call that the mean. However this doesn't always work. Say you have a torus, if you embed this in R 3 you can find the mean however there is not a unique way to project a point in R 3 onto a torus. This is because if you draw a straight line through the origin and the mean it may cross the torus more than once, unlike with a sphere. I hope you found this problem interesting. Any links to resources discussing how this might be done would be greatly appreciated. Also any original ideas would be good too. Thanks","['general-topology', 'means', 'statistics']"

It seems possible the answer doesn't just depend on $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, but on the other hand, I might just be missing the right trick of how to apply i.i.d.

( Hint : it may help to use the previous exercise, i.e. 'Prove that the set of bijections $\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ is uncountable' ) There also was a subquestion where I had to prove that if $f$ is repetitive then for any $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ there are infinitely manu $k$'s with the property. I don't see how to prove the uncountability. My first idea was to assume countability and then through a diagonalization argument end up with a contradition. But constructing a function which has the repetitive property seems hard... Perhaps the hint wants to point at something like an injection from the set of bijections to the set of repetitive numbers. But still this would imply some sort of construction of this repetitive functions. If I have a permutation of $\mathbb{N}$, how could I maps this one-to-one to the set of repetitive functions? I would prefer hints instead of full solutions. Edit: Inspired by Omnomnomnom's comment I tried the following:
Let $\mathscr{B} = \{g:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N} \text{ bijections}\}$, and $\mathscr{R} = \{f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N} \text{ repetitive function}\}$, we aim to find a injection $\phi: \mathscr{B}\to \mathscr{R}$, since this would imply uncountable many repetitive functions. Choose a $f_0\in \mathscr{R}$ and consider $\phi: \mathscr{B}\to \mathscr{R}; g\mapsto g\circ f_0$. Is this function well defined? I claim that $g\circ f_0$ is repetitive. Let $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ be a sequence of natural numbers, then consider the sequence $(g^{-1}(a_1), g^{-1}(a_2), \ldots, g^{-1}(a_n))$. Since $f_0$ is repetitive we find a $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_0(k) = g^{-1}(a_1), \ldots, f_0(k+n-1) = g^{-1}(a_n)$. But then $g\circ f_0(k) = a_1, \ldots, g\circ f_0(k+n-1) = a_n$. Okay, $g\circ f_0$ is repetitive. Is $\phi$ injective? Let $g\circ f_0 = h\circ f_0$. Notice how $f_0$ must be surjective, since it is a repetitive function. (Just consider the finite sequence $(a_0)$ for any $a_0\in \mathbb{N}$). Now choose an $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then there is a $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_0(k) = n$. Now consider $g(n) = g(f_0(k)) = g\circ f_0(k) = h\circ f_0(k) = h(n)$. Which implies $g=h$.

Within this scheme, and given the tens $N=0,3,6,9\ldots$, we can uniquely define a parallelogram by means of the four points corresponding to the four integers $N+1$, $(N+10)+1$, $(N+40)+9$ and $(N+50)+9$, as easily illustrated below. For instance, the parallelogram corresponding to the ten $N=3$ is defined by the integers $31,41,79$ and $89$, whereas the one corresponding to $N=6$ is defined by $61,71,109, 119$. My conjecture is: On the perimeter of each parallelogram there cannot be more than $7$ primes. In the following picture, I denote with a red cross some of the missing primes , i.e. those integers that occupy one of the $8$ possible positions that the primes can occupy on the parallelograms, but that are not primes. And here some more (sorry for the bad quality). (This conjecture is motivated by the fact that, if true, it can perhaps be used to devise a method to determine which point will be missing on the parallelogram $N+1$, knowing which ones are missing on the previous $N$ parallelograms, but this is another problem!). So far, I tried to use the strategies suggested in this post , but without much success. I apologize in case this is a trivial question, and I will thank you for any suggestion and/or comment. Also, in case this question is not clear or not rigorous, please help me to improve it (I am not an expert of prime numbers).  Thank you!

2888541,Is Fermat's last theorem provable in Peano arithmetic?,"The sentence $S$ which Gödel in his proof of the incompleteness theorem proves to be be unprovable in the system of Peano arithmetic can be proved (as a true theorem of PA) outside PA (and necessarily only outside PA). Compared to  Fermat's last theorem $F$ which states that for $n>2, a, b, c \in \mathbb{N}$ $$a^n + b^n = c^n \rightarrow a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0$$ it's hard to write $S$ down as a sentence of PA and understand its meaning. Nevertheless it's a (true) theorem of pure number theory, perfectly expressible in the language of PA. And for both $S$ and $F$ no proof inside PA is known. (For $S$ there cannot be one.) My question is: Can it be shown (and/or how can be shown) that Fermat's last theorem has no proof in the language of Peano arithmetic? This would imply that one must leave the realm of Peano arithmetic to prove it. As a side question: How would one - in general terms - name the realms in which Gödel and Wiles performed their proofs?

  $$r(T)\leq r (\widetilde{T})?$$ Note that the inner product on $F\oplus F$ is defined as follows: If $x=\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\end{pmatrix}\in F\oplus F$ with $x_1,x_2\in F$, and $x'=\begin{pmatrix}x_1'\\ x_2'\end{pmatrix}$ similarly, then
$$\langle x,x'\rangle_{F\oplus F}:= \langle x_1,x_1'\rangle_F +\langle x_2,x_2'\rangle.$$ I see the following theorem in a more general context but I'm facing difficulties to understand the proof Theorem 1.1 Let $A = (A_{ij})_{n \times n}$ be an operator matrix and $\tilde{A} = (\| A_{ij} \|)_{n \times n}$ its block-norm matrix.
  Then $\omega(A) \leq \omega(\tilde{A})$, $\| A \| \leq \| \tilde{A} \|$, $r_\sigma(A) \leq r_\sigma(\tilde{A})$. (Original image here .) Proof: 3. Notice, in general, that for operators $A = (A_{ij})_{n \times n}$ and $B = (B_{ij})_{n \times n}$ we have
  $$
       \| \widetilde{AB} \|
  \leq \| \tilde{A} \tilde{B} \| .
$$
  In fact, $\tilde{A} \tilde{B} - \widetilde{AB}$ is a nonnegative matrix since $\widetilde{AB} = (\| \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik} B_{kj} \|)_{n \times n}$ and $\tilde{A} \tilde{B} = (\sum_{k=1}^n \| A_{ik} \| \| B_{kj} \|)_{n \times n}$.
  Therefore, by the norm monotonicity of nonnegative matrices, we get $\| \widetilde{AB} \| \leq \| \tilde{A} \tilde{B} \|$.
  Using induction, we have
  $$
       \| A^m \|
  \leq \| \widetilde{A^m} \|
  \leq \| \smash{\tilde{A}}\vphantom{A}^m \| ,
$$
  for every positive integer $m$.

  \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{x_n} = a.

  = \log \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n-1}}

(see ftp://ftp.math.ucla.edu/pub/camreport/cam12-18.pdf ) and discussion here ( Curl of unit normal vector on a surface is zero? ) I think Stoke’s theorem implies that $\vec{n}\cdot\nabla\times\vec{n}=0$ but this isn’t quite $\nabla\times\vec{n}=0$. In particular, it doesn't seem like the unit vector for u in toroidal coordinates $(u,v,\phi)$ satisfies this ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ToroidalCoordinates.html ) Yet constant u corresponds to toroidal surfaces. So what I'm pondering is how to translate $\nabla\times\vec{n}=0$ into
practice. For example, the curl in general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates
is
\begin{align}
\nabla\times\vec{f}=&\frac{1}{h_2\,h_3}\,\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x_2}\left(h_3\,f_3\right)-\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x_3}\left(h_2\,f_2\right)\right]\,\vec{e}_1+\frac{1}{h_3\,h_1}\,\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x_3}\left(h_1\,f_1\right)-\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x_1}\left(h_3\,f_3\right)\right]\,\vec{e}_2\nonumber\\
&\qquad+\frac{1}{h_1\,h_2}\,\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(h_2\,f_2\right)-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\left(h_1\,f_1\right)\right]\,\vec{e}_3  
\end{align} where $h_i$ are the scale factors and $\vec{e}_i$ are the unit vectors along
coordinate lines $x_i$. For spherical coordinates
$(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(r,\theta,\phi)$ the scale factors are $h_1=1$, $h_2=r$, and
$h_3=r\,\sin\theta$. If I take surfaces normal to the sphere $\vec{n}=\vec{e}_1$ with $f_1=1$,
clearly $\frac{\partial}{\partial
  x_3}\left(h_1\,f_1\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial
  x_2}\left(h_1\,f_1\right)=0$ and $\nabla\times\vec{n}=0$. If I take toroidal coordinates $(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(u,v,\phi)$ with scale factors
$h_1=h_2=a/\left(\cosh{u}-\cos{v}\right)$ and
$h_3=a\,\sinh{u}/\left(\cosh{u}-\cos{v}\right)$ where $a$ is a parameter and
$u=\mathrm{constant}$ are toroidal surfaces. Then naively I would take the
unit normal to the toroidal surfaces to be $\vec{n}=\vec{e}_1$ again
corresponding to $f_1=1$. However this leads to
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\vec{f}=\frac{1}{h_3\,h_1}\,\left(\frac{\partial{h}_1}{\partial
    x_3}\right)\,\vec{e}_2-\frac{1}{h_1\,h_2}\,\left(\frac{\partial{h}_1}{\partial x_2}\right)\,\vec{e}_3=\frac{\sin{v}}{a}\,\vec{e}_3
\end{equation} So it seems that the naive assumption $\vec{n}=\vec{e}_1$ isn't correct for
this coordinate system? So how do I find the proper normal that satisfies
$\nabla\times{n}=0$ and $\vec{n}\cdot\vec{n}=1$ in an general orthogonal
curvilinear coordinate system? Obviously, from definition of the $\nabla\times$
above $f_1=1/h_1$ satisfies the former condition but not the latter
condition.

2888788,What is Expected Prediction Error (EPE) a function of?,"Context I am self-studying Elements of Statistical Learning (2nd ed), by Friedman, Hastie & Tibshirani. I have a question with regards to what the EPE, as defined in this text, is a function of. Namely, on page 10 (equation 2.9), EPE is defined as: $\text{EPE}(f) = \text{E}_{X, Y}(Y - f(X))^2$ This implies that EPE is a function of the learner, $f$, and that it is an expectation over the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$. I accept and understand this definition, since it distinguishes EPE from mean squared error (MSE), which is defined for some $x_0 \in \Omega_X$ as: $\text{MSE}(x_0) = \text{E}_{\mathcal{T}}(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2$ Where $\mathcal{T}$ represents the training set, and $\hat{f}$ represents the corresponding learner. Note that the above equation assumes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is deterministic -- $y_0$ is assumed to be a constant. Question Where my confusion arises is in the use of EPE on page 18 (equation 2.27). The context of its use is this: the relationship between $Y$ (the dependent variable) and $X$ (the independent variable) is assumed to be linear in $X$: $Y = X^T\beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ independently of $X$. Then, for some arbitrary test point $x_0$, equation 2.27 is stated in the following manner: $\text{EPE}(x_0) = \text{E}_{y_0|x_0}\text{E}_{\mathcal{T}}(y_0 - \hat{y}_0)^2$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the training set. My issue with the above is that I cannot see how the use of EPE in equation 2.27 is equivalent to that of equation 2.9; is there a way to show that they are? Or is the latter notation incorrect, and EPE is only a function of the learner? Related question I have just taken a look at the ""related questions"" after posting this one, and have found the following question . It appears to express a similar sentiment as mine. The accepted answer, as I understand it, seemingly implies the usage of EPE in equation 2.27 is inconsistent.

New here.).","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'descriptive-statistics', 'terminology']"
2888796,Analogies between Hodge conjecture and Tate conjecture,"I hear sometimes that there is many analogies between the Hodge conjecture and the Tate conjecture.
If we take a look at the statements of this two conjectures, we have the followings : The Tate conjecture : Let $k$ be a field and let $X$ be a smooth geometrically irreducible projective variety over $k$ of dimension $d$. We denote by $\overline{X} = X \times_k \overline{k}$ the base change of $X$ to the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. The Galois group $G = Gal ( \overline{k} / k )$ then acts on $\overline{X}$ via the second factor. Let $Z^r ( \overline{X} )$ be the free abelian group generated by the irreducible closed subvarieties of $\overline{X}$ of codimension $r$ ( $1 \leq r \leq d$ ). An element of $ Z^r ( \overline{X} ) $ is called an algebraic cycle of codimension $ r $ on $\overline{X}$. Let $\ell $ be a prime different from $p = \mathrm{car} (k) \geq 0$.
There is a cycle map ( of $G$ - modules ) : $$ c^r \ : \ Z^r ( \overline{X} ) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_{ \ell } \to H^{2r} ( \overline{X} , \mathbb{Q}_{ \ell } ( r ) )^G $$ which associates to every algebraic cycle an $ \ell $ - adic etale cohomology class. Suppose $k$  is finitely generated over its prime field. Then, the Tate conjecture says that the map $c^r$ is surjective. The Hodge conjecture : For each integer $ p \in \mathbb{N} $, let $ H^{p,p} (X) $ denotes the subspace of $ H^{2p} ( X ,\mathbb{C} ) $ of type $ (p,p) $. The group of rational $ (p,p) $- cycles : $ H^{p,p} (X , \mathbb{Q} ) = H^{2p} ( X , \mathbb{Q} ) \cap H^{p,p} (X) $ is called the group of rational Hodge classes of type $ (p,p) $. An $ r $ -cycle of an algebraic variety $ X $ is a formal finite linear combination $ \displaystyle \sum_{ i \in [1,h] } m_i Z_i $ of closed irreducible subvarieties $ Z $ of dimension $ r $ with integer coefficients $ m_i $. The group of $ r $ -cycles is denoted by $ \mathcal{Z}_r (X) $. On a compact complex algebraic manifold, the class of closed irreducible subvarieties of codimension $ p $ extends into a linear morphism : $$ \mathrm{cl}_{ \mathbb{Q} } \ : \ \mathcal{Z}_{p} (X) \otimes \mathbb{Q} \to H^{p,p} (X, \mathbb{Q} ) $$ 
defined by : $ \mathrm{cl}_{ \mathbb{Q} } \big( \sum_{ i \in [1,h] } m_i Z_i \big) = \sum_{ i \in [1,h] } m_i \eta_{Z_{i}} \ , \ \forall m_i \in \mathbb{Q} $. The elements of the image of $ \mathrm{cl}_{ \mathbb{Q} } $ are called rational algebraic Hodge classes of type $ (p,p) $. The Hodge conjecture says : On a non-singular complex projective variety, any rational Hodge class of type $ (p,p) $ is algebraic, i.e : in the image of $ \mathrm{cl}_{ \mathbb{Q} } $. Questions : If we look at the statements of the two conjectures above, and look for similarities between them, which group $G$ is it such that: $H^{2k} (X, \mathbb{Q})^G = H^{2p } (X, \mathbb {Q}) \cap H ^ {p, p} (X)$ to bring the statement of Hodge's conjecture closer to the statement of Tate's conjecture?

In that corollary, our teacher proved that if a finite group G has order 30 then, It will have a normal subgroup of order $15$; Sylow $3$-subgroup and Sylow $5$-subgroup will be normal in $G$. If you’ll see that we can write the order of group as,
$$
  o(G) = 30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5
$$ and you can easily observe that $2,3,5$ are primes and $2 < 3 < 5$ also the difference of the first two primes is $1$ (i.e. $3-2$) and the last two primes are $2$ (i.e. $5-3$). Let us write this in quite an easy manner,
$$

where the product of primes in left side gives us the order of G and the right side’s no. are the differences between the first two and the last two primes respectively.

Now my doubt is, are there infinitely many such combinations of three primes $(p, q, r)$ with $p < q < r$ such that the difference of first two and the last two primes can be written as $2^{k-1}$ (i.e. $q-p$) and $2^k$ (i.e. $r-q$), where $k \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e.
$$
 (p, q, r) ⇒ (2^{k-1}, 2^k)
$$
such that $p \cdot q \cdot r$ is an order of a group $G$ such that, $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $q \cdot r$; Sylow $q$-subgroup and Sylow $r$-subgroup will be normal in $G$. Moreover, if we are able to find such combination $(p, q, r)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then will it be a unique combination for that $k$ and if it is not unique i.e. if there is more than one such combination then how many combinations are possible for that particular $k$ and is there any relation between the combinations for that $k$?","['number-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
