537130,"What is the probability of picking $3$ $A$'s, $4$ $B$'s, $5$ $C$'s and $8$ $D$'s when you pick $20$ balls?","Q: Choose $20$ balls from an urn with infinite numbers of balls. The balls are labeled with $A, B, C, D$ and each has $25$% of chances getting picked. What is the probability of picking $3$ $A$'s, $4$ $B$'s, $5$ $C$'s and $8$ $D$'s when you pick $20$ balls? My approach to this question is: total # of permutations = $4^{20}$ ways of having $8$ $D$'s = ${20 \choose 8}$ ways of having $5$ $C$'s = ${12 \choose 5}$ ways of having $4$ $B$'s = ${7 \choose 4}$ permutation of these = $4!$ Probability: $(4! \cdot {20 \choose 8} \cdot {12 \choose 5} \cdot {7 \choose 4}) / 4^{20}$ I am not sure if I am doing this correctly or not.

537172,$A \oplus B = A \oplus C$ imply $B = C$?,"I don't quite yet understand how $\oplus$ (xor) works yet. I know that fundamentally in terms of truth tables it means only 1 value(p or q) can be true, but not both.
But when it comes to solving problems with them or proving equalities I have no idea how to use $\oplus$. For example: I'm trying to do a problem in which I have to prove or disprove with a counterexample whether or not $A \oplus B = A \oplus C$  implies $B = C$ is true. I know that the venn diagram of $\oplus$ in this case includes the regions of A and B excluding the areas they overlap. And similarly it includes regions of A and C but not the areas they overlap. It would look something like this: I feel the statement above would be true just by looking at the venn diagram since the area ABC is included in the $\oplus$, but I'm not sure if that's an adequate enough proof. 
On the other hand, I could be completely wrong about my reasoning. Also just for clarity's sake: Would $A\cup B = A \cup C$ and $A \cap B = A \cap C$ be proven in a similar way to show whether or not the conditions imply $B = C$? A counterexample/ proof of this would be appreciated as well.","['proof-writing', 'discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"
537173,Copulas/Probability Theory,"So I have a basic understanding of copulas but wanted to verify I'm applying things correctly to reach the correct outcomes.. Show that as $\theta\to\infty, C^{Fr}(u_1,u_2)\to\min(u_1,u_2)$, the co-monotonicity
copula. Consider a random vector $Y\mathbf=(Y_1,\ldots,Y_d)'$ with joint CDF $F$ and marginal CDFs $F_1,\ldots,F_d$. The copula of $Y$ is the function $C:[0,1]^d \to [0,1]$ defined by
$$F(y_1,\ldots,y_d)=C\left(F_1(y_1),\ldots,F_d(y_d)\right).$$ a) If we suppose that $d=1$, what is the copula of $Y_1$? b) Show that $C(1,\ldots,1,u_i,1,\ldots,1)=u_i$. c) Show that $C$ is increasing in each of its arguments. d) If we suppose that all $Y_i$s are independent, what is the copula of $Y$? Show formally. e) Let $Y=(Y_1,Y_2)'$ be Gaussian. Give the expression for the copula of $Y$. Use this expression to show that it includes the independence, co-monotonicity, and counter-monotonicity copulas. My work/thoughts so far: Where
$$\phi^{Fr}(u)=-\log\left\lbrace{e^{-\theta u}-1\over e^{-\theta}-1}\right\rbrace, -\infty<\theta<\infty$$
As $\theta\to\infty$, the effect of $u$ decreases, such that $\phi^{Fr}(u_1)\approx\phi^{Fr}(u_2)$, thus $C(u_1,u_2)=P(U_1\le u_1,U_1\le u_2)=\min(u_1,u_2)$. a) For $d=1:C(F_1(Y_1))=F(Y_1)=P(Y_1\le y_1)$ ? b) I know this has to do with each $u_i$ being the marginal, and the combination thereof being required to have uniform distribution. The property makes sense to me but I'm unsure how to explain it. c) So I understand the intuition here: since cdfs are always increasing $C(u_1,\ldots,u_d)$ is increasing with each component $u_i$. But again I'm not sure how to formally show that. d) Setting $u_i=F_i(x_i)=F(x_i)$ where $F(Y)\sim U[0,1]$ (for continuous functions), we get $C(u_1,\ldots,u_i) = u_1 \times\cdots\times u_i$. While this agrees with the independence copula, I feel like this is possibly missing something and/or incorrect..? e) I'm still working on this but think I know where I'm going with it. Any thoughts/suggestions/references to other resources are greatly appreciated. :)","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'random-variables']"

537484,Reference request: Graduate Algebra book for self study,"I have had little exposure to algebra during my undergraduate degree, covering essentially only the basics of group theory with an emphasis on the symmetries of Euclidean space, and a course on Galois theory. I hugely enjoyed these subjects and I'd love to learn more algebra. However I need to do this in self - study mode, and also I'd need to narrow the topics a little. I am doing a PhD in topological analysis so the background material I study these days is broadly differential geometry, functional analysis, algebraic topology. I do not confine my interests to these (interesting!) areas in general but I have to restrain myself due to time constraints. Question 1: What are the most suitable topics in algebra that I could study on the side? I already have some ideas, such as multilinear algebra, module theory, Clifford algebras (I need to understand Dirac operators) or homological algebra, but I am not sure these are actually the ""optimal"" choices (subject to the constraint that I need to focus on finishing my PhD). Another way to go would be Lie theory and Representation theory (closely related and very useful in ""my"" area, though not purely algebraic). But as I said there may be better choices, also I am aware that my suggestions differ widely with regards to their generality. Another topic that I dearly wish to become familiar with is Category theory! If I find the time to spend more time with Algebra I'd prefer to do it from the point of view of Category theory. Question 2: What are the recommendable graduate level books on Algebra that are well suited for self - study, focus on the appropriate topics (as suggested above, for example) and take Category theory into account?

Those who want to be more formal might insist on smooth meaning $C^\infty$. While the operator taking $f$ to its Taylor series at some point in its domain uses information about all the partial derivatives of $f$ at once, I don't think I know an example to settle the following question: Is there anything I can do simultaneously with infinitely many derivatives of a $C^\infty$, not necessarily analytic function? I hope that's not phrased too vaguely. Since there are $C^\infty$ functions with zero Taylor series, for instance, something like ""sure-you can put all its derivatives into an infinite series!"" is probably not relevant. I won't be surprised if answer is ""No, $C^\infty$ doesn't mean materially more than $C^k$ for sufficiently large $k$."" But I'd be very interested to hear otherwise.",['differential-geometry']
537572,"Any Set with Associativity, Left Identity, Left Inverse is a Group","Related Link: Right identity and Right inverse implies a group Reference: Fraleigh p. 49 Question 4.38 in A First Course in Abstract Algebra I will present my proof (distinct from those in the link) for critique and then ask my question.  $G$ is a set and $ \times $ is an associative binary operation.  Suppose that there exists a $e \in G$ such that, for all $a \in G$, $ea = a$ and $a^{-1}a = e$ for some $a^{-1} \in G$.  Show that for the same $e$, $ae = a$ and $aa^{-1} = e$. $a^{-1}(aa^{-1})a = (a^{-1}a)(a^{-1}a) = ee = e = a^{-1}a = a^{-1}(a^{-1}a)a$ Since $a^{-1} \in G$, it has a left inverse; apply it to both ends, and we have $(aa^{-1})a = (a^{-1}a)a$. As a result, $ae$ = $a(a^{-1}a) = (aa^{-1})a = (a^{-1}a)a = ea$. For the right inverse, start with $aa^{-1} = a(a^{-1}a)a^{-1} = (aa^{-1})(aa^{-1})$. Since $\times$ is a binary operation, $aa^{-1} \in G$ and has a left inverse; apply it to both ends, and we have $e = aa^{-1}$. In second comment following the question in the link, Mr. Derek Holt pointed out that the requester did not word his/her question correctly.  Specifically, the identity in the second axiom is not well-defined. Let $(G, *)$ be a semi-group. Suppose 1. $ \exists e \in G$ such that $\forall a \in G,\  ae = a$; 2. $\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G$ such that $aa^{-1} = e$. How can we prove that $(G,*)$ is a group? This formulation makes the same technical error as many textbooks. The $e$ in your second axiom is not well-defined. ""But obviously it's intended to be the same $e$ as in the first axiom"" you reply. But the first axiom does not necessarily specify a unique element $e$. So should we interpret the second axiom as meaning ""for some $e$ as in 1"" or ""for all $e$ as in 1""? –  Derek Holt Sep 17 '11 at 15:31 Was he saying that if, in axiom 1, we have $ae_1 = a, ae_2 = a$, but $e_1 \neq e_2$, when we get to axiom 2, do we have $aa^{-1} = e_1, aa^{-1} = e_2$, or two different inverses so that $aa_1^{-1} =  e_1, aa^{-1}_2 = e_2$?  I think my wording eliminated the ambiguity.  It does not imply that $e$ is unique, but if $e$ is a left identity and produces left inverses, then it is also a right identity and produces right inverses. I tried really hard on this one; please kindly point out my mistakes.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Thus, $\forall n\geq N$, $x_n\in\bar{B}(x_N,1)$ which is compact by assumption, so $(x_n)_{n=N}^\infty$ is a sequence in this compact set and thus has a convergent subsequence.

537602,Why is the trace of a matrix the sum along its diagonal?,"Define the trace of a matrix with entries in $\mathbb C$ to be the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity. It is a standard (but I think extremely surprising) fact that this is the sum of the elements along the diagonal. One proof of this is as follows: Define $Tr'(A)$ to be the sum of the entries along the diagonal of $A$. If $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix and $B$ and $m\times n$ matrix, we have
$$Tr'(AB)=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}b_{ji}=\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{i=1}^n b_{ji}a_{ij}=Tr'(BA)$$
and thus for any invertible matrix $P$ we have $Tr'(PAP^{-1})=Tr'(P^{-1}PA)=Tr'(A)$, i.e. $Tr'$ is independent of basis. Thus it suffices to note that when $A$ is in Jordan Normal Form, $Tr'(A)$ is the trace of $A$.

The first function $x(\vec{y})$ is a scalar-valued multivariate function, the second function $\vec{y}(\vec{z})$ is a vector-valued multivariate function. The gradient is the vector of partial derivatives:

The Jacobian is the matrix of partial derivatives:
$$
J_{\vec{y}}(\vec{z}) =

\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
\frac{\partial y_n}{\partial z_1}(\vec{z}) & \dots & \frac{\partial y_n}{\partial z_m}(\vec{z})

$$ Of course, I could explicitly form the function $x(\vec{z})$ by replacing each $y_i$ by $y_i(\vec{z})$ and then find the partial derivatives $\partial x/\partial{z_j}$. However, the function $\vec{y}(\vec{z})$ is rather complex (not in the sense of complex numbers, but in the sense that it contains many trigonometric expressions), which would make the process quite cumbersome. On the other hand, the gradient $\nabla x(\vec{y})$ and the Jacobian $J_{\vec{y}}(\vec{z})$ are rather simple.

538400,Understanding what an action is?,"This is a very simple question, and I am quite embarrassed to ask it! I'm trying to understand what an action is in general, and perhaps the best place to start is to try and outline my current understanding. I understand what a group action on a set is, a map $G \times X \rightarrow X$, where $(g,x) \mapsto g\cdot x$. such that $e \cdot x = x, \forall x \in X $, and  $(gh)\cdot x = g\cdot(h\cdot x)$ By the properties above each element of $G$ gives us a bijection of elements in $X$, and we have a homomorphism $G \rightarrow \textrm{Sym}(X)$ As I understand it we can also have a group acting on other objects, namely we say a group $G$ acts on an object $A$ if we have a group homomorphism $G \rightarrow \textrm{End}(A)$ E.g. in Galois theory, if we have a Galois extension $E / F$ with Galois group $G$, then $G$ acts on $E$, as we have a map $G \times E \rightarrow E$, where $(g,a) \mapsto g(a)$. By its definition $g$ is an automorphism of $E$, and the group operation is composition of functions so $(g, (h , a)) = (gh ,a)$.  From my understanding, this action is not just on the underlying set of the field, we actually mean that the action respects the field structure. So in general if we want to show that a group $G$ acts on an object $A$ we have to: (1) associate an element $g \in G$ with a map $\phi_g: A \rightarrow A$ (2) Show that this map is a homomorphism $\phi_g \in \textrm{Hom} (A,A)$, i.e. that it respects all the operations of $A$, and (3) show that for $g_1, g_2 \in G$ we have $\phi_{g_1g_2} = \phi_{g_1} (\phi_{g_2})$. Hopefully I am right so far, please correct me if not. Where I am having trouble is twofold. Firstly, I am worried that my understanding is a little off. When $X$ is a set, the action of an element of $G$ is a bijection of the set, so it seems to me that if an object $A$  has an underlying set $X$ then should we instead expect a homomorphism $G \rightarrow \textrm{Aut}(A)$? In fact, regardless of the underlying set, using an element of $G$ and its inverse then the composition property implies that the homomorphism associated with any element $g \in G$ has an inverse, namely the homomorphism associated to $g^{-1}$. Secondly, I don't have an understanding or appreciation of the significance of group actions in a wider setting, for example if we have a Galois extension $E / F$ with Galois group $G$, and let $N$ be the fixed field of a normal subgroup $H \trianglelefteq G$, then $G$ acts on $H$ by conjugation. But I am struggling to see the interpretation of this i.e. what meaning the action has in terms of the field extension, or the group.

We also know that just by looking at $\sqrt{y}$, the fact that it is not Lipschitz immediately suggests this ODE may have multiple solutions. I have a few questions regarding this: 1) Let $y'=f(y,t)$ with $y(0)=0$ where $f$ is not Lipchitz in $y$. Is this always enough to guarantee a nonunique solution to $y$? I suppose this is probably equivalent to asking how multiple fixed points arise when a mapping is non-contractive. 2) Supposing we are assured that $y'=f(y,t)$ does not have a unique solution, is there a systematic way of characterizing all nonunique solutions? In particular, most of the examples I've seen such as the $\sqrt{y}$ example have the solution $y=0$ and I would be interested to see drastically different solutions. More to the point, for something like $y'=\sqrt{y}$ is there a way to conclude that $y=\frac{1}{4}(t-a)^2$ and $y=0$ are the only solutions? Does this generalize to harder problems?

$\phi_4(x)= e^{-\sqrt{2}x} \sin{\sqrt{2}x}.$ And from there computing the Wronskian (it is $256$) can be accomplished by trudging through the computation. However, since the solutions have such a nice symmetry on the complex unit circle, is there an easier way of coming to the solution? I tried to do this problem at first by avoiding taking the determinant, but ended spending more time than I would have anyway in doing so. I want to believe there is an easier way to do this problem, and I feel like there is a trick that I'm not seeing.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'wronskian']"
