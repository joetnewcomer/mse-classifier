4799373,"Why is this the ""most general"" first order ODE that can be solved?","Braun's book (p. 58) says that the ODE $$\frac{d}{dt}[\Phi(t,y)]=0\tag{1}$$ is clearly the most general first-order differential equation
that we can solve . Of course, all equations having that form can be  (implicitly) solved: $$\Phi(t,y)=c.$$ However, the converse (stated by Braun) is not ""clear"" for me. So, how could we explain it? For example, the most general first-order ODE is $$F(t,y,y')=0.\tag{2}$$ Suppose that this ODE have a solution $$G(t,y)=0.\tag{3}$$ Doesn't Braun's statement mean that (2) and (3) imply that $(2)$ can be written in the form (1)? If so, how to prove it? If not, what does Braun mean?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
4799449,Limit of a Sequence of Spiraling Points,"The Problem Starting with the vertices $P_1(0,1), P_2(1,1), P_3(1,0), P_4(0,0)$ of a square, we construct further points as shown in the figure: $P_5$ is the midpoint of $P_1P_2$ , $P_6$ is the midpoint of $P_2P_3$ , $P_7$ is the midpoint of $P_3P_4$ , and so on. The polygonal spiral path $P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5P_6P_7\cdots$ approaches a point $P$ inside the square. Find the coordinates of $P$ . [ Calculus by James Stewart, $7^\text{th}$ edition, chapter $11$ , problem plus, problem $18$ ] What I Have Tried First of all, let $P_n=(x_n,y_n)$ . We will first consider only $x$ -coordinates first because the $y$ -coordinate of $P$ can be found similarly. I have proven using induction that $\tfrac12x_n+x_{n+1}+x_{n+2}+x_{n+3}=2$ for all $n\geq1$ as follows. Base Case ( $n=1$ ) Since $x_1=0, x_2=1, x_3=1, x_4=0$ , we have $\tfrac12x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=\tfrac12\cdot0+1+1+0=2.$ Induction ( $n>1$ ) Assume that $\tfrac12x_n+x_{n+1}+x_{n+2}+x_{n+3}=2$ is true for $n=k$ , then \begin{equation}
x_{k+2}+x_{k+3}=2-\tfrac12x_k-x_{k+1}.
\end{equation} Also observe that $x_{n+4}=\tfrac12(x_n+x_{n+1})$ . Therefore \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\tfrac12x_{k+1}+x_{k+2}+x_{k+3}+x_{k+4}&=\tfrac12x_{k+1}+(2-\tfrac12x_k-x_{k+1})+x_{k+4}\\\\
&=\tfrac12x_{k+1}+2-\tfrac12x_k-x_{k+1}+\tfrac12(x_k+x_{k+1})\\\\ 
&=2
\end{split}
\end{equation} and so it is true for $n=k+1$ . So if $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n$ exists, we can apply the limit as $n$ approaches $\infty$ to both sides of the equation to get (letting $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n=L_x$ ) $$\tfrac12L_x+3L_x=2$$ or $$L_x=\tfrac47.$$ My Question The problem arises: how do we prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n$ does exist? All I've been able to do is prove that $0\leq x_n\leq1$ for all $n\geq1$ . I couldn't find anything on the web that could help.

4799452,Reference request for the existence of Sobolev traces on Lipschitz domains,"Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^d$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Then it is well known that the trace operator $$ \operatorname{tr} \colon W^{1, 1}(\Omega) \to L^1(\partial \Omega)$$ is well-defined and bounded. However, I was unable to find a citable reference for this fact. The references I found either focus on the $L^2$ -setting, assume more regularity of the boundary of $\Omega$ (mostly $C^1$ -boundary) or are kind of obscure. Another reference, is the seminal paper of Gagliardo for that fact, the drawback of this reference being that it is written in Italian. Nonetheless, I cannot imagine that there is not a well-cited book serving as a standard reference for PDEs or Sobolev spaces that contains the result in the above form. So it would be very nice if someone would know a reference including the result.

4799506,Can You Prove that a Function Is Holomorphic Without Appealing to Cauchy-Integral Formula,"Suppose that the function $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a holomorphic function on some domain $U$ .

More generally, can it be shown that if a function $F: \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is real differentiable, satisfies Cauchy-Riemann-Equations on $U-\{ z_{0} \}$ , and if $\lim_{z \rightarrow z_{0}} F(z)$ is finite, then $F$ is real differentiable at $z = z_{0}$ and $F$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann Equations at $z = z_{0}$ . My initial thoughts were that we could use the continuity of the partial derivatives to show that the Cauchy-Riemann Equations must be satisfied and $z = z_{0}$ . We could also use the fact that $F$ is real differentiable on $U - \{ z_{0} \}$ along with continuity to show that $F$ is also real-differentiable at $z = z_{0}$ .","['complex-analysis', 'derivatives']"

4799556,Linear ODEs on random orthogonal matrices,"I am working on a music synthesizer project. We are just kind of playing around trying to get an interesting way to vary N parameters with a nice balance of predictability and surprise.  I had an idea to choose a random orthogonal (complex) NxN matrix $\mathbf{A}$ , and then solve the linear ODE $y' = \mathbf{A}y$ (using Euler's method).  But something strange happens -- there are a few seconds of interesting semi-chaos, but then things quickly seem to start to settle into a very simple periodic pattern, with all parameters getting stuck in lock-step with each other, all with the same period and even most with the same phase. My question is, is this behavior some interesting property of ODEs on random matrices, or should this not be happening and my solver has some problem?  What is the typical behavior of $e^{\mathbf{A}t}$ for $\mathbf{A}$ random and orthogonal? Possibly important detail(?):  after each step of Euler's method, I normalize the vector (otherwise I start getting exponential blowup from rounding errors). $\mathbf{A}$ is orthogonal so in a perfect world this wouldn't do anything. But I'm intuitively worried this normalization step is causing some damping of the system that is suppressing its interesting dynamics.","['random-matrices', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4799566,"Why is there Symmetry (Equality) between ""the first marble being blue"" and ""the second marble being blue"" here?","This problem is of my own construction, which I have constructed to understand Symmetry better. Say that we have three bags, each having blue and red marbles. In the bag 1, $1 \over 2$ of the marbles are blue; in bag 2, $1 \over 3$ of the marbles are blue; in bag 3, $1 \over 4$ of the marbles are blue. Say our experiment consists of first randomly choosing a bag, grabbing a marble from it, and then choosing another bag, and grabbing a marble from this new bag. When considering the probability of the first marble we pick being blue, I am trying to understand why this is the same as the probability of the second marble we pick being blue, by a symmetrical argument (not just a brute force calculation of the probabilities to show they are equal). So far, I have tried to show that every sample point in the event of the first marble being blue corresponds to a sample point of equal probability in the event of the second marble being blue - and I show such correspondence by switching the first marble we have grabbed with the second. And then the bijection is straightforward to prove. However, I am struggling with arguing that when we swap which marble we have grabbed in the first and second spots, that this necessarily has the same probability of us sampling it - although I certainly feel intuitively that this is so, I can't explain why it is so at all. So why is there Symmetry between ""the first marble being blue"" and ""the second marble being blue"" here? EDIT: Is it valid to justify why the experiments of picking from the first bag and picking from the second bag after it are the same by saying that because we know nothing of the first bag and marble drawn before we drew the second, we act as if it never happened when drawing from the second bag? As if we say that the second experiment was different than the first, then given this we could possibly say what more likely happened on the first picking of the bag, in such a way that would contradict the probabilities we have for the first picking of the bag and marble?","['symmetry', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"
4799607,Is the distribution of the Pearson correlation symmetric around zero?,"Let $(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$ be a sample from a bivariate distribution $\operatorname{Law}(X_1, Y_1)$ .

f(r) = \frac{(1-r^2)^{\frac{n-4}{2}}}{B(0.5, 0.5(n-2))}, \quad r \in [-1,1]

\hat{\rho} \xrightarrow[n \to \infty]{d, \mathbb{P}} 0,
$$ so the asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\rho}$ is symmetric around zero. What I can't handle is how to prove the property for a fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Thank you in advance. UPD. More general question: consider the general correlation coefficient $$

$$ where $c_{i,j}(\mathbf{X}) = f(X_i, X_j)$ for some antisymmetric function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ . It is easy to derive that for the Pearson correlation coefficient $f(t,s) = t-s$ .

4799653,Use of elemental length in volume of a truncated cone,"The typical way to compute the volume of a truncated cone is to slice into discs and calculate the volume of a differential cylinder. While doing that we first take the area of the disc $\pi f(x)^2$ and then multiply with thickness which we assume to be $dx$ and then get the final area is $\pi \int f(x)^2dx$ . But why should $dx$ be the thickness. As I have indicated in the picture,we are basically taking a tiny step along the surface which is $dl$ which again can be written as $\sqrt{(dy)^2+(dx)^2}$ . That changes the entire integration with a factor of $1+\sqrt{(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}$ and hence changes the volume? So which integral should be correct and why should $dx$ be the thickness and not $dL$ ? This issue is arising because if we were to calculate the surface area of this solid,we would have actually used $dL$ instead of $dx$ . So why are we taking two different thickness while accounting for the same differential cylinder?

Then draw the smallest circle enclosing those points. ( Here are some algorithms for doing so.) The circle may or may not lie completely on the disk. For example, with $n=7$ , here are examples of both cases. What is $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\{\text{Probability that the circle lies completely on the disk}\}$ ? Is the limiting probability $0$ ? Or $1$ ? Or something in between? My geometrical intuition fails to tell me anything. The case $n=2$ I have only been able to find that, when $n=2$ , the probability that the smallest enclosing circle lies completely on the disk, is $2/3$ . Without loss of generality, assume that the perimeter of the disk is $x^2+y^2=1$ , and the two points are $(x,y)$ and $(0,\sqrt t)$ where $t$ is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$ . The smallest enclosing circle has centre $C\left(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y+\sqrt t}{2}\right)$ and radius $r=\frac12\sqrt{x^2+(y-\sqrt t)^2}$ . If the smallest enclosing circle lies completely on the disk, then $C$ lies within $1-r$ of the origin.

In the proof of Proposition 5.4, which is on the deformation of Drinfeld modules, he defines an action of a certain group $A_x^{\ast}$ on the functors of deformations of formal modules and Drinfeld modules. In Drinfeld's notations, we let $F_0$ denote the ring representing the deformation functor of a Drinfeld $A$ -module $X$ over $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_p$ , and let $F_0^{'}$ be the ring representing the deformation functor of the same object $X$ but viewed as a Drinfeld $\mathbf{F}_p[x]$ -module, where $A=\Gamma(X-\{\infty\},\mathcal{O}_X)$ is the ring of integers in a global function field.

My book says to First, rotate the coordinate system through an angle $\theta$ . This
means that the coordinates $x$ and $y$ should be replaced by,
respectively, $x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta$ and $-x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta$ . Choosing an appropriate $\theta$ , we can
make the coefficient of $xy$ equal to zero. With this modification was able to rewrite the equation as $$1=xy=(x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta)(-x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta)=-x^2(\sin\theta\cos\theta)+xy(\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta)+y^2(\sin\theta\cos\theta).$$ To get rid of the $xy$ term I set $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ which simplified the equation to $$1=-\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{4}.$$ But the signs on my $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms are not what they should be with real $a,b$ . I assume this can be remedied in the next step, but I'm not sure how. Next we move the origin to $(x_0,y_0)$ , i.e., we replace $x$ by $x+x_0$ and $y$ by $y+y_0$ .

To do this, I just gave the general example of x being an arbitrary element of A, which means that x is an element of the preimage of the intersection, which means for all values of i f(x) is an element of Ui, which means x is an element of the intersection of the preimage of Ui.

\end{align*} The inequality switches in the last step since we assume $\theta_1>\theta_0$ . However this seems odd. Using some probability theory we calculate $k''$ for $\alpha=0.05$ . Since the sum of i.i.d exponential r.v. is $Gamma(n,\theta)$ and $Gamma(n,1/2) = \chi^2(2n)$ this results in the condition \begin{equation*}\alpha  = \mathcal{P}_{\theta_0}(\overline{X}_n <k'') = \mathcal{P}_{\theta_0}(2\theta_0n\overline{X}_n <2\theta_0nk'').
\end{equation*} Thus we get $2\theta_0nk''= \chi^2_{1-\alpha}(2n)$ , where the subscript denotes the $1-\alpha$ quantile. Therefore, $$ k''=\frac{\chi^2_{1-\alpha}(2n)}{2\theta_0n}.$$ The reason why the condition $\overline{X}_n <k''$ seems odd is the following simulation for a sample of 15 exponential r.v. with parameter $\theta = 1$ , where i test $\theta_0 = 1$ vs $\theta_1 = 2$ . The likehood ratio process goes very nicely to $0$ , as one would expect with how i chose the values. However the condition for the sample mean would reject the null in favor of the paramter $\theta_1$ , since the sample mean is lower than the critical value $k''$ (in the image discription it says k'). This cannot be right, therefore I assume an error when calculating $k''.$ and","['statistics', 'probability-theory', 'hypothesis-testing']"
4800549,Possible number of open sets in a topology,Question: Is there a topological space with exactly 100 distinct open sets? My attempt : I took topological space which is countable. Maximum number of open sets in a topological space is $2^n$ which is the set of all possible subsets. Number of elements in this topological space can't be lesser than 7 since for 6 elements the maximum possible subsets is $2^6< 100$ . First I took 5 elements as singletons and a single  2 element set Y. ( $\phi$ is already included in thees 32 subset)These 5 elements form 32 subsets.Hence along with Y and whole set  we have 34 sets. On taking union of all possible sets with Y I got 65 sets. I tried different possibilities like this. But this method leads to nowhere. I couldn't find a clear cut logic though I put efforts on this problem for many days.

Is there some key concept behin this problem that I am missing. Please help me in proving or disproving this problem.,['general-topology']

(Often) in mathematical texts, the symbols $\subset$ , $\subseteq$ , $\subsetneq$ , $<$ , $\leq$ have the following meanings: $A \subset B$ and $A \subseteq B$ mean the same thing - that $A$ is a subset of $B$ , possibly with $A=B$ . For $A$ a proper subset of $B$ , we often write $A \subsetneq B$ . $x<y$ is a strict inequality, $x \leq y$ means that $x$ is less than or equal to $y$ . The line underneath is required to say there is equality in the numerical case, whereas in the case of sets that is not the case. Indeed, often in elementary/primary school, children would be taught this way of remembering the symbols. When reaching set theory, this is thrown out. Is there any reason for this inconsistency?

4800621,Questions about the explanation of $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1$,"This explanation comes from my textbook: In the computation of $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta}$ , we first use the unit circle to compare the following areas as follows $\frac{\sin\theta}{2} < \frac{\theta}{2} < \frac{\tan \theta}{2}$ or more simply, $\sin \theta < \theta < \tan \theta$ . Taking reciprocals (which we can do since we are only consiering small $\theta > 0$ ) reverses the direction of the inequalities, so we have $\frac{1}{\tan \theta} < \frac{1}{\theta} < \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ . Then, multiplying by $\sin \theta$ (which is positive), and noting that $\frac{\sin \theta}{\tan \theta} = \cos \theta$ , gives us $\cos \theta < \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} < 1$ . Our calculation only establishes this inequality chain for $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ , but since all the terms are the same when we replace $\theta$ with $-\theta$ , it is true for all nonzero $\theta \in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\big)$ . Furthermore, our above argument shows that $-\theta < \sin \theta < \theta$ for values of $\theta$ close to $0$ , and hence $\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^{2} \theta} > \sqrt{1 - \theta^{2}} > 1 - \theta^{2}$ , so we have $1 - \theta^{2} < \cos \theta < \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} < 1$ for values of $\theta$ sufficiently close to $0$ . Thus, by the Squeeze Theorem, since $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} (1-\theta^{2}) = \displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} 1 =1$ , we conclude that $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}}\frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1$ . Basically, I would like to know how we get $\sqrt{1 - \theta^{2}} > 1 - \theta^{2}$ ? Also, why can't we just use the Squeeze Theorem with $\cos \theta < \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} < 1$ , where $\theta \to 0$ to show that $\displaystyle{\lim_{\theta \to 0}} \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta}=1$ ?

We all have seen the diagram of an injective mapping where few elements of the range set has no pre-image in the domain. My reasoning gets stuck when I think about how can I define the inverse function $g : B \to A$ , where $A, B$ are sets with $|A|=n, |B|=n+2$ and there exists an injective mapping $f: A \to B$ , such that each elements of $A$ gets mapped to exactly one element of the set $B$ . Clearly set $B$ has extra two elements. Since $f$ is injective, then $g$ has to be injective. But my doubts are:- $a$ • when we construct the inverse function $g: B \to A$ , then do we include those two un-mapped elements for mapping? $b$ • Is there any difference between these terms $\textrm{not mapping two elements of the domain to the range set}$ and $\textrm{two elements in the domain do not have images in the range set}$ ? $c$ • From the image it is clear that in case of injective mapping there can be elements in the range set who have no pre-image. But can we say that in case of inverse injective mapping some elements in domain (here set $B$ ) may have no image in the range set ( here set $A$ )? If yes, doesn't it contradict the definition of a function?

If we take the averages of all the $n$ th and $(n + 2)$ th terms (where $n$ is an odd number), we get the sequence :- (1 + 15) / 2, (15 + 65) / 2, (65 + 175) / 2, ...

or,

8, 40, 120, 272, 520, 888, ...       --- (i) Then, taking the sequence of the middle or the even $n$ th terms [( $n + 1$ )th terms, where $n$ is odd], we get this :- 5, 34, 111, 260, 505, 870, ...       --- (ii) Subtracting the sequence (ii) of middle terms from the sequence (i) of the averages of the neighbouring extremes, we get:- 8 - 5, 40 - 34, 120 - 111, 272 - 12, 520 - 505, 888 - 870, ...

... Have a look at the ""hypotenuse"" or the right-most numbers of the rows of the triangle. Notice that they are triangular numbers , given by the formula $\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$ . Take a look at the pairs of $2$ nd and $3$ rd, $5$ th and $6$ th, $8$ th and $9$ th, ... $(3n - 1)$ th and $(3n)$ th of these triangular numbers (shown above by * s). That is, (3, 6), (15, 21), (36, 45), (66, 78), ... Observe that, yet again, all of these numbers are divisible by 3. Written as multiples of 3, they are:- (3 * 1, 3 * 2), (3 * 5, 3 * 7), (3 * 12, 3 * 15), (3 * 22, 3 * 26), ... Here, the differences between the multiplicands in individual pairs are:- 2 - 1, 7 - 5, 13 - 12, 26 - 22, ...

      ... This time, observe the ""perpendicular"" or the left-most numbers.

The differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are:- 1, 2, 7, 12, 41, 70, 239, 408, 1393, 2378, ...      ---- (iii) And the differences between this sequence's (iii) terms are:- 1, 5, 5, 29, 29, 169, 169, 985, 985, ... Why do only these numbers pop up, that too in pairs of two ? Let's look at the vertical gap between two consecutive numbers:- 0, 1, 2, 9, 16, 57, 98, 337, 576, 1969, 3362, ... For example, the first perfect square -- $1$ , shows up in the first row. So, there is $0$ gap between the row containing the previous perfect square and that of $1$ . Similarly, $4$ comes $1$ row after $1$ , so it has a gap of $1$ , $16$ comes $2$ rows after $4$ , so it has a gap of $2$ , $121$ comes $9$ rows after $16$ , so it has a gap of $9$ , etc. This sequence's differences are:- 1, 1, 7, 7, 41, 41, 239, 239, 1393, 1393, ... Notice that this looks like the sequence (iii) [i.e., of the differences between consecutive terms of the square roots of the perfect squares, found in the left-most perpendicular column of the triangle.] 1, 2, 7, 12, 41, 70, 239, 408, 1393, 2378, ...
1, 1, 7, 7, 41, 41, 239, 239, 1393, 1393, ... The only variation being that all of the even $n$ th terms are replaced by the term that precedes them. Why is this? Let's observe the terms that got ""ignored"" [even $n$ th terms]:- 2, 12, 70, 408, 2378, ... Dividing this by 2, 1, 6, 35, 204, 1189, ... Here, after a bit of scrutiny, we observe that the formula for the $n$ th term of this sequence would be:- \begin{align*}
T_n = 6 \cdot T_{n-1} - T_{n-2}
\end{align*} where $T_0 = 0$ and $T_1 = 1$ . For example, $T_2$ will be 6 * 1 - 0 , $T_3$ will be 6 * 6 - 1 , $T_4$ will be 6 * 35 - 6 , etc. What is the reason behind this exact formula here? Searching the sequence up in OEIS, we get this , having the exact formula we just noticed. But it is also given there that $T_n ^ 2$ is a triangular number. Why is this true? Now let's look at the ones that did not get ""ignored"" [odd $n$ th terms]:- 1, 7, 41, 239, 1393, ... We observe that the formula for the $n$ th term of this sequence would be the same as the previous one:- \begin{align*}
T_n = 6 \cdot T_{n-1} - T_{n-2}
\end{align*} where $T_0 = -1$ and $T_1 = 1$ . Note that this time, $T_0 = -1$ , and not $0$ . The same questions emerge again, why is this true? What are the relationships among these numbers and formulae, and what more is special about them? Let's now look for primes in this perpendicular (shown by * s):- 1, 2, 7, 11, 29, 37, 67, 79, 137, 191, 211, 277, 379, 631, 821, 947, 991, 1129, 1327, 1597, 1831, 2017, 2081, 2347, 2557, 2851, 2927, 3571, 3917, 4561, 4657, 4951, 5051, 5779, 6217, 6329, ... The first few of them come clumped in pairs, but then the pattern changes and becomes confusing at best. I tried seeing if there is a pattern in the fact that some are equal to $3$ (shown by ! s), while some are equal to $1$ (shown by @ s) (mod $4$ ), but no luck again. There were many such false alarms, where the patterns ultimately broke apart. Could you try and explain why these primes show up, and what are some interesting relations / properties that you can come up with? I know this is a really long question, so it would be really helpful if you could answer or extend any aspect of any problem. Moreover, more properties and relationships that you can find related to this triangle are really appreciated.

Solutions When $N=2$ , the only solution appears to be $(x_{1},x_{2}) = (3,5) $ , which yields the rational $\ \ $ number $\frac{8}{15}$ . For $N=3$ , we have the solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (3,6,28)$ , yielding the rational number $\frac{15}{28}$ . For $N=4$ , I've found eight solutions so far. Let $x_{a}^{4}$ be the $a$ 'th solution of the equation in four variables. We then have $x_{1}^{4} = (3, 7, 24, 52)$ , $x_{2}^{4} = (3, 9, 15, 37) $ , $x_{3}^{4} = (3, 9, 16, 32)$ , $x_{4}^{4} = (3, 10, 15, 26)$ , $x_{5}^{4} = (4, 5, 15, 36)$ , $x_{6}^{4} = (4,5,17,28)$ , $x_{7}^{4} = (4,7,8,35)$ , and $x_{8}^{4} = (5,6,10,12)$ .

4801034,Proving the Dimension of the Commutant Space of a $n\times n$ Matrix is Greater Than or Equal to $n$,"$M_n(F)$ represents the collection of all square matrices of size $n \times n$ with elements from the field $F$ . Let's take a specific matrix $A$ from $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ , where $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers. We'll define a set $C(A)$ as the set of matrices $B$ in $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ such that the product $AB$ is equal to $BA$ : $$C(A)=\{B\in M_n(\mathbb{R})\mid AB=BA\}$$ It can be shown relatively easily that the set $C(A)$ forms a vector space over the field of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ . We are tasked with demonstrating that the dimension of this vector space is greater than or equal to $n$ : $$\text{dim }C(A)\geq n$$ I've extensively researched various approaches to this problem and came across several methods that involve concepts like the Jordan canonical form, the minimal polynomial, and the characteristic polynomial of matrix A, ideas related to linear transformations. However, I aim to tackle this problem using the knowledge I've acquired in my course. Some of them are: Matrix elementary operations and elementary matrices. Row-reduced echelon form of a matrix. Vector space, including its definition, properties, basis, dimension, kernel, and nullity. Subspaces and their properties, as well as their relationship to the vector spaces they are part of. Understanding linear independence and dependence of vectors. The concept of a coordinate vector relative to a given basis. Recognition of row and column spaces of a matrix, although I haven't yet encountered the rank of a matrix. $\dots$ Because the methods we have for solving the problem are quite basic, I believe it's enough to demonstrate that we have a minimum of $n$ elements in the basis. I suspect that techniques involving diagonal matrices, nullity, and elementary matrices might be useful for this purpose. I would greatly appreciate any assistance or hints to help me solve this problem using the knowledge and concepts I've already been taught in my course. If you'd like to utilize advanced ideas, try to demonstrate them using fundamental concepts or establish their characteristics using basic tools. For instance, if you plan to utilize the Jordan canonical form, begin by explaining what it is and then highlight the specific characteristics of this concept that you will use to address the main problem. However, in this context, simply mentioning the names of the relevant concepts along with their properties or referencing a source that introduces and proves these properties is sufficient and greatly appreciated.

4801042,Question about only centering a matrix once in the covariance matrix,"From probability, we have $$\Sigma_x = \frac{\left(HX\right)^T\left(HX\right)}{N}$$ Where $\Sigma_X$ is the covariance matrix for a data matrix $X$ . $X$ is constructed by putting all the datapoints in rows, so the first row is the first datapoint, the second row is the second collected data point and so forth. $H$ is the centering matrix $I - \frac{11^T}{N}$ Simplifying $\Sigma_X$ , $$\frac{\left(HX\right)^T\left(HX\right)}{N} = \frac{X^TH^T H X }{N} = \frac{X^T H ^2 X}{N} = \frac{X^THX}{N}$$ This both makes sense and doesn't make sense. At first glance, centering a matrix once and then doing so again does nothing the second time around. Matrix $H$ is idempotent. As a result when we lose the squared above the H, I'm okay with that. However digging a little deeper, it doesn't make sense that only one of my data matrices is centered when I should have two centered data matrices to properly compute covariance. Going to the 1D case, $$E[(X - \mu_{x})^2]  \neq E[X(X - \mu_{x})]$$ Here it doesn't make sense for only one of my $X$ random variables to be centered while the other one isn't.","['statistics', 'covariance', 'variance', 'expected-value', 'linear-algebra']"

It was then pointed out by bof that for $N=100$ , there exists a topology with $N$ open sets on a set of size $8$ , but M W showed there does not exist such a topology on a set of size $7$ . Let $\operatorname{Par}(N)$ be the topological par of each positive integer $N$ , defined as the smallest cardinality of a topological space that has exactly $N$ open sets. Then $\operatorname{Par}(100)=8$ by bof and M W's results.

My attempt: For every $x\in A,\,\exists T_x\in\tau$ with $x\in T_x$ and $T_x\subseteq A$ .
This follows from $$\partial A := \{x \in X;\, \mathrm{for\ every\ } T\in\tau\mathrm{\ with\ } x\in T\mathrm{,\ } A\cap T \neq \varnothing \;\mathrm{and}\;(X\setminus A)\cap T \neq\varnothing\}$$ since if no such $T_x$ existed, then either $$T_x\cap A\neq\varnothing\ \wedge\ T_x\cap\partial A\neq\varnothing\ \wedge\ T_x\cap(X\setminus \overline{A})=\varnothing$$ which is impossible by the definition of $\partial A$ , or $$T_x\cap A\neq\varnothing\ \wedge\ T_x\cap\partial A\neq\varnothing\ \wedge\ T_x\cap(X\setminus\overline{A} )\neq\varnothing$$ meaning $x\in\partial A$ which violates the assumption. Since $T_x\subseteq A$ we have $\cup T_x\subseteq A$ . Furthermore, for every $x\in A$ we have $x\in T_x$ so that $A\subseteq\cup T_x$ . Thus $A = \cup T_x$ , giving us $A\in\tau$ by definition.

Part $(b)$ I also got the correct answer. However, I find the logic I'm using to be dubious (although I suspect it is the same logic that Edexcel considers correct). My answer to b : When making trigonometric substitutions, I have been told that you should use a bijective function as the substitution: this helps determine the maximum domain on which you can choose the substitution. So let $x=\cos \theta,\quad 0\leq \theta \leq \pi.$ (Note that this is that largest domain on which the substitution is bijective). Using the identity from part $(a),$ the equation $ 16 x^5 - 20 x^3 + 5x + 1 = 0\ $ is equivalent to $\ \cos 5\theta = -1.\ $ Since we defined $0\leq \theta \leq \pi,\ $ it follows that $ 0\leq 5\theta \leq 5\pi.\ $ Thus we have to solve $\ \cos 5\theta = -1\ $ in the interval $ 0\leq 5\theta \leq 5\pi.\ $ This has solutions: $$\ 5\theta = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi,\ \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{5}, \frac{3\pi}{5}, \frac{5\pi}{5},$$ $$\implies x=\cos\theta = \cos\frac{\pi}{5},\ \cos\frac{3\pi}{5},\ \cos\frac{5\pi}{5} = 0.809, -0.309, -1. $$ $$$$ The part I find dubious is that we have only looked for roots of the equation $ 16 x^5 - 20 x^3 + 5x + 1 = 0 $ that are between $-1$ and $1$ .

(Strictly for personal use - nothing for sale - retirement learning process.) I calculate the Radian (Rad) by degree (Rad = Degrees * PI() / 180), stepping all the way around the ellipse, one Degree at a time. I use the following two equations for calculate the X and Y points for each Degree step around. X = (Width * COS( Rad )) Y = (Height * SIN( Rad )) (Width and Height are half of the diameter of their respective axis.) I usually use 0,0 as my center point. This works well for dishes and bowls where the major axis is perfectly horizontal or vertical. Now, I'm trying to branch out, and I'm hitting a snag. Would there be a reasonable way to modify these equations to be able to skew the major/minor axis set, using, as an example, a 15 Degree skew? (If I can see how to do it with a specific skew angle, I think I can figure out how to adapt it to what I'm doing. That's why I suggested a 15 Degree skew angle.)

4801232,Complex vector bundle valued forms,"Let $X$ be a smooth manifold and $E \to X$ a complex vector bundle. A connection on $E$ is a $\mathbb{C}$ -linear map $\nabla \colon \Gamma(X,E) \to \Omega^1(X,E)$ where $\Gamma(X,E)$ denotes the space of sections of $E$ and $\Omega^1(X,E)$ is the space of  the space of sections of $T^{\vee} X \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} E$ , where $T^{\vee} X = \mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{R}(TX,\mathbb{R})$ . Now if $X$ comes with an almost complex structure $J$ , then one usually considers the complexified spaces. In particular $T^{\vee}_{\mathbb{C}} X = T^{\vee} X \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} = \mathrm{Hom}_\mathbb{R}(TX,\mathbb{C})$ . This space comes with a splitting induced by the $\pm \mathrm{i}$ -subspaces of $J$ , i.e. $T^{\vee}_{\mathbb{C}} X = T^{1,0}X^{\vee} \oplus T^{1,0}X^{\vee}$ . This induces a splitting $\Omega_{\mathbb{C}}^1(X,E) = \Omega^{1,0}(X,E)\oplus \Omega^{0,1}(X,E)$ . In many textbooks it is then written that $\nabla = \nabla^{1,0} + \nabla^{0,1}$ . But $\nabla$ was defined as a map into $\Omega^1(X,E)$ . Is this the same space as $\Omega^1_{\mathbb{C}}(X,E)$ ?

4801278,Proof Verification: Prove X and Y are open sets,"The exercise was to show that the following two sets are open given $G$ is a region and $f$ is holomorphic in $G$ . $ X = \{a \in G \text{: there exists } r>0 \text{ such that }f(z)= 0 \text{ for all } z\in D[a,r]\}$ $ Y = \{a \in G \text{: there exists } r>0 \text{ such that }f(z) \ne 0 \text{ for all } z\in D[a,r]\backslash \{a\}\}$ My proof did not use the fact that $f$ is holomorphic, so I fear there is a flaw somewhere. Here is my attempt at proving this. Let $x \in X\cap \partial X$ . Since $x \in X$ , we know there is $r>0$ such that for all $z \in D[x,r], f(z)=0$ . Similarly, since $x\in\partial X$ , for all $R>0$ there is some $z \in D[x,R]$ such that $z\notin X$ . In particular, there is $z^*$ in $D[x,r]$ such that $z^* \notin X$ . Choosing $\delta = \text{min}\{|x-z^*|, r-|x-z^*|\}$ , we know $f(z) \ne 0$ for some $z \in D[z^*, \delta]$ and $D[z^*,\delta] \subset D[x,r]$ . But this contradicts $f(z)=0$ for all $z\in D[x,r]$ , showing $X \cap \partial X = \emptyset$ , meaning $X$ is open. Let $y \in Y$ . Then there is $r>0$ such that $f(z) \ne 0$ for all $z \in D[y,r] \backslash \{y\}$ . Pick $a \in D[y,r] \backslash \{y\}$ . Let $\epsilon = \text{min}\{|y-a|, r-|y-a|\}$ . Then $f(z) \ne 0$ for all $z \in D[a, \epsilon]$ because $D[a,\epsilon] \subset D[y,r] \backslash \{y\}$ . So $a \in Y$ , meaning $D[y,r] \subset Y$ , so $Y$ is open.","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"
4801347,The number of the union-intersection calculation results equals to the number of paths,"Problem Statement: Let $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_{2k+1}$ be $2k+1$ generic sets. We insert $\cap$ and $\cup$ alternately between them, as $A_1\cap A_2\cup A_3\dots\cup A_{2k+1}$ . The calculation results depend on how I add the parentheses, as $A_1\cap (A_2\cup A_3)$ generally does not equal to $(A_1\cap A_2)\cup A_3$ . But sometimes different parenthesis may have same results, as $((A_1\cap A_2)\cup (A_3\cap A_4))\cup A_5$ equals to $(A_1\cap A_2)\cup ((A_3\cap A_4))\cup A_5)$ . Among all possible ways to add the parentheses, how many distinct results (for general sets) are there? What about $2k$ sets? I have written some code and looked for OEIS, and it turns out the $2k$ -set case matches A032349 and $2k+1$ -set case matches A027307 . The description for the sequence is partially correct. Both of them are considering paths taking steps $(2,1),(1,2),(1,-1)$ and does not fall below $x$ axis, but A032349 has wrong starting point and destination: it should be from $(0,1)$ to $(3k+1,0)$ . I have tried several ways to deal with this, such as deriving a recurrent formula for the number of results (as we deal with Catalan) or doing bijection (I have make the number of sets to some kind of trees). However, I failed. One of my friends hinted this literature as ""schroder path"" or ""full ternary tree"", but I cannot understand it... Can anyone craft an easy-to-understand bijection or proof? Thank you all! P.S. As @Henry pointed out there is another combinatorial interpretation of the sequence, which is A084078 . It is the length of generating sequences, starting from $[0]$ (see it as a python list), and every time we substitute each $k$ the values $-|k+1|,-|k+1|+2,\dots,|k-1|$ . For example, initial is $[0]$ , and the range for $0$ is $[-1,1]$ , so $[0]$ becomes $[-1,1]$ . Now for $-1$ the range is $[0,2]$ and for $1$ it is $[-2,0]$ , so the sequence becomes $[0,2,-2,0]$ . Then the sequence becomes $[-1,1,-3,-1,1,-1,1,3,-1,1]$ , and so on. Now the question becomes more complecated... is there a (bijective, hopefully) proof for proving the number of these three items to be equal?",['combinatorics']
4801389,Does the law of truly large numbers/infinite monkey theorem hold with an ever decreasing probability?,"Recently I've been considering a game (I'm unsure if it has a proper name and is an already studied problem), and it proceeds as follows. Flip a coin, selecting a value of either 0 or 1. Append the result to the sequence of past flips. If the last flip has marked the repetition of the past history of the sequence (i.e. the first half of the sequence now equals the second half), the game terminates. Otherwise, keep playing the game. Some example runs where the game terminates might be 11, or 00, or 101101, or 1001110011, etc. But the longer sequences get exponentially less likely to be repeated, for instance had the last example ended instead with a 0, we would then need to just by chance get the precise sequence of subsequent flips 1001110010 to form 1001110010[|]1001110010. Thus after a certain point, it seems as though we are bound to keep failing forever, eternally making the required sequence we must repeat to finish the game longer and longer. And running some basic simulations of 1000 different random seeds for this game reveals a curious distribution of game lengths: Game Length Occurrences (/1000) 2 521 4 127 6 59 8 15 10 13 12 3 14 1 16 2 18 1 22 1 > 1,000,000 257 Here the final category the game was manually terminated after iterating beyond 1 million in length (as these sequences seem to run forever or for a very long time). The rarest game lengths are actually the intermediate length games, with a decent portion falling into this exceedingly long case instead. This pattern is interesting to me, and my question ultimately is, do these sequences truly run forever ? Past a certain point does this probabilistic game become truly hopeless, even though at each step as the sequence gets longer there is a non-zero probability of the past history of the sequence happening to exactly reoccur? I liken this game by analogy to moving twice as far away from a quantum tunnelling particle every time it fails to tunnel to your location, which also seems to imply it would never catch you even given infinite time. Or perhaps if the works of Shakespeare expanded by an additional character with each wrong keypress by the monkey at the typewriter, multiplying the difficulty. But at the same time this logic contrasts with my intuition about the law of truly large numbers, which says given infinite time any events with non-zero probability will eventually happen. So how is the law affected in the case where the probability in question is not constant, but eternally decreasing (halving with each failure in this case)? Edit: As an interesting aside, if we instead roll a 10 sided die, the result from the long runs becomes a sequence of random digits, e.g. 943669542398...; and I notice by definition this sequence avoids repetitions, and so if we put a decimal point before it, 0.943669542398... for instance, we are essentially constructing an irrational number. The distribution also shifts such that the vast majority of runs end up in the long seemingly endless case.","['binary', 'probability', 'sequences-and-series']"

Let's try an example: $$gff$$ $$=(ffgg)f$$ $$=ffg(gf)$$ $$=ffg(ffgg)$$ $$=ff(gff)gg$$ $$=ff\big(ff(gff)gg\big)gg$$ $$=ff\Big(ff\big(ff(gff)gg\big)gg\Big)gg$$ Evidently, applying that law can never get rid of the $gff$ in the middle.

As before, the answer is negative; there's another self-replicating expression: $$(a\oplus b)\odot(a\oplus b)$$ $$=\big((a\oplus b)\odot(a\oplus b)\big)\oplus(a\odot b)$$ So what about other modifications of the distributive law, $$a\odot(b\oplus c)=P(a,b,c)$$ where $P$ is a polynomial in the standard form?

Let $R$ be a set of size $\mathfrak c=2^{\aleph_0}$ and say $\mathcal F\subset \mathcal P(R)$ is a family of humongous sets if it has the two following properties: If $P = \{P_n: n\in\mathbb N\}$ is a countable chain ( $P_0\subset P_1\subset P_2\subset\dots$ ) such that $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N} P_n = R$ , then $P\cap\mathcal F\ne\varnothing$ , i.e., there is an humongous set in $P$ . If $\{H_n: n\in\mathbb N\}\subset\mathcal F$ is a countable family of humongous sets, then $\left|\displaystyle\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} H_n\right| = \mathfrak c$ . I wonder if one can find a family of humongous sets. The difference from my previous question is the change of $P$ from a partition to a chain. With a partition, by taking $R:=\mathbb R$ , one could force intervals of arbitrarily small length to be humongous, which would contradict the intersection property. With the change for a chain I hope to make this no longer possible.","['measure-theory', 'cardinals', 'set-theory']"

4801801,Supremum of a bounded set of real-valued functions in $L^\infty(X)$,"Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and consider the algebra $L^\infty(X)$ . The real-valued functions carry a canonical order, where $g\leq f$ if $g(x)\leq f(x)$ a.e. The following result holds: Let $B\subset L^\infty(X)$ be a  set of real valued functions which is bounded (that is, there exists $c>0$ with $\|f\|_\infty\leq c$ for all $f\in B$ ). Then $B$ admits a least upper bound $g$ in $L^\infty(X)$ . As far as I can tell, the straightforward argument that one first thinks about does not work; because one would attempt to take the pointwise supremum, which of course will be bounded but there is no obvious reason why it has to be measurable. Moreover, taking the pointwise supremum raises the issue of dealing with possibly uncountably many nullsets, which kind of puts the argument away from usual measure theory. The reason I know the result is true is the following. For any $F\subset B$ finite, we can define $g_F=\max\{f:\ f\in F\}$ . Because we are dealing with finitely many functions, $g_F\in L^\infty(X)$ and $f\leq g_F$ a.e. for all $f\in F$ . Now the net $\{g_F\}_{F\in B}$ is a monotone increasing bounded net of real-valued functions. Here is where I need to appeal to higher level stuff: since $L^\infty(X)$ is a von Neumann algebra, any bounded monotone increasing net of selfadjoint elements admits a least upper bound.  So there exists $g\in L^\infty(X)$ that is the least upper bound of $\{g_F\}_{F\in B}$ . The reason $g$ is a least upper bound for $B$ is that if $h$ is an upper bound for $B$ , then $g_F\leq h$ for all $F$ , and then $g\leq h$ . And now we get to the question: is it possible to prove the existence of the least upper bound for $B$ , with measure theory arguments? The proof using von Neumann algebra ideas is not crazy hard, but it uses non-trivial results. Basically one represents $L^\infty(X)$ faithfully on $B(\ell^2(X))$ acting by left multiplication, that is $\pi(f)\eta=f\,\eta$ , and considers the numerical nets $\{\langle \pi(g_F)\xi,\xi\rangle\}$ for each $\xi\in \ell^2(X)$ . As these are bounded monotone nets in $\mathbb R$ , they converge. This way one gets numbers $\{\langle T\xi,\xi\rangle\}$ and it is standard Hilbert space theory using polarization that this defines an operator $T\in B(\ell^2(X))$ . The operator $T$ is a weak-operator limit of elements of $\pi(L^\infty(X))$ , which is a von Neumann algebra, and so $T\in \pi(L^\infty(X))$ , which means that there exists $g\in L^\infty(X)$ with $\pi(g)=T$ .

Define the operator $A$ as follows $$ A(u)(x) = \int_{C} \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|} |dy| $$ The spectrum of A is described in [79, Section 12.2.2].
Then the principal cauchy problem: $$  \frac{d}{dt} + A, t> 0 $$ Which is reminiscent of the modified zeta function $$ f(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} e^{-z \sum_{n=1}^{k} \frac{1}{n}} $$ Admits a meromorphic extension to the entire complex plane.

The only way I can try to make sense of this is that the sign of the integral should cancel out the sign of $dy$ for every point on the unit circle. I.E. this is the same as: $$ A(u)(x) = \int_{y \in C} \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{y|x-y|}  $$ But if that was true the author would've just gone ahead and said that. So I think I don't understand what $|dy|$ is supposed to be. The author makes a mention that this is ""reminiscent of the modified zeta function"" but not equal to.

So perhaps we need not know what $|dy|$ means at all to make sense of this (just consider it as a line integral over $C$ ).

On the other hand wikipedia defines a connection on a vector bundle as $\nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$ such that it satisfies the Leibniz rule. This question is more about the properties of $\Gamma$ and $\otimes$ than it is about connections, but I would be interested in understanding how I can go from $\nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$ to the one given by Tu? Do I need that $T^*M\otimes E \cong \mathrm{Hom}(TM,E)$ and is there some property that says something about the Hom functor or the tensor product under $\Gamma$ ?",['differential-geometry']
4801894,Sum of Rows of Vandermonde Matrix,"Question Consider some Vandermonde matrix defined by $$
V = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_1 &x_1^2& ... & x_1^{M-1}\\
1 & x_2 &x_2^2& ... & x_2^{M-1}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots && \vdots\\
1 & x_M &x_M^2& ... & x_M^{M-1}\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$ for some $\{x_i :i = 1, 2, ..., M \land x_i \in \mathbb{R}\}$ . Numerically, I have observed that the sum of the rows of the inverse may have an interesting property: $$
\sum_k (V^{-1})_{i,k} = \delta_{i,0}.
$$ That is, this sum is equal to one for the first row of $V^{-1}$ and zero for all others. Is there any way for me to demonstrate this property? Attempts I began with elementwise analytical expressions for the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix but was unable to simplify my expressions. Inspired by this question , I used expressions for the sums of a truncated geometric series and obtained the expression: $$
\sum_k V^{-1}_{i,k}\left(\frac{1 - x_k^M}{1-x_k} \right) = 1
$$ But am unable to see a way forward. Finally, I have found one proof which is necessary for $\sum_k (V^{-1})_{i,k} = \delta_{i,0}$ but certainly not sufficient.","['matrices', 'summation', 'proof-writing', 'linear-algebra']"
4801926,Continuous vs holomorphic functional calculus,"Let $A$ be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. Then, it has a continuous functional calculus, which I can think of as arising from the fact that polynomials are dense in $\mathcal{C}(\sigma(A))$ . It also has a holomorphic functional calculus. Are these the same? On the one hand, any holomorphic function on a neighborhood of $\sigma(A)$ is certainly continuous on $\sigma(A)$ and the two calculi agree in this case, thanks to Runge's theorem, as discussed at Why does the image of continuous functional calculus coincide with the holomorphic functional calculus when considering holomorphic functions? . On the other hand, any uniform limit of polynomials (or any holomorphic functions) is holomorphic. This seems to suggest that the holomorphic and continuous functional calculi are valid for the exact same classes of functions. Is this correct? Well, clearly it isn't, since there are plenty of continuous functions of one variable which aren't even differentiable, so they certainly don't admit holomorphic extensions on any neighborhood. I suspect that the issue in the last paragraph is that one needs to be careful with domains. Namely, maybe there is a sequence of polynomials which is uniformly convergent on $\sigma(A)$ but not on an open neighborhood thereof, and so the continuous functional calculus could apply while the holomorphic one does not? Finally, if this is the correct reason why the continuous functional calculus is more general, then does this give an easy way to generalize the holomorphic calculus for any bounded operator? Namely, we get an isometry from the closure of $\mathcal{R}_A$ in $\mathcal{C}(\sigma(A))$ to $\mathcal{B}(V)$ , where $\mathcal{R}_A$ is the space of rational functions whose poles are in $\rho(A)$ , which by Runge's theorem accounts for the holomorphic functional calculus but again probably gets a bit more?

4801935,Converting $68^8$ microseconds to years without calculator,"The following problem is easy to solve with the help of a calculator. However, when doing it manually, we are faced with a very large exponentiation ( $68^8$ ) and which, at first glance, does not seem possible to be manipulated together with the remaining data of the problem to find a simplified final result. The problem follows: Suppose a password for a computer system must be exactly $8$ characters long, where each character in the password is either a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, a decimal digit, or one of six special characters ( *><!+= ). If it takes a microsecond ( $10^{-6}$ seconds) for a hacker to check if a password is correct, how many years would it take for the hacker to try every possible password? What I've tried:
Using a calculator, I first calculate the number of possible passwords, which is $68^8$ . Then I multiply it by the time it takes for the hacker to test each one, so it becomes $68^8\times10^{-6}$ . To convert the result into years, I first convert it into minutes by dividing by $60$ , then into hours by dividing by $60$ again, then I convert it into days by dividing by $24$ , and finally into years by dividing by $365$ . It gives a little more than $14$ years. I have tried to simplify the expression $$\frac{68^8}{10^6\cdot 60^2\cdot 24\cdot 365}$$ that gives the answer of the question, but even finding some common factors between numerator and denominator, this doesn't help too much, because $17$ is a prime factor of $68$ , and I don't think it appears as a factor of anything in the denominator. Also, I would like to do that in a efficient way, in a short time, without spending too much paper. Edit.: We have noticed that a aproximated answer is the better option here. I think it is suficient to get the integer part of the aumont of years.","['combinatorics', 'estimation']"
4801989,How to show this perturbed matrix also has negative real parts for $\delta$ small enough,"Based on this question: Show that the $x_\delta$ is asymptotically stable of the following system ODE . Consider the following nonlinear system of ODE $$
x'(t)=f(x(t))+\delta g(x(t)), x\in R^N
$$ where $f$ and $g$ are two smooth vector fields and $\delta$ is a parameter. Suppose that as $\delta=0$ , the system has a hyperbolic and asymptotically stable equilibrium $x_0$ . That means eigenvalues of its linearization have negative real parts. By implicit function theorem with $\phi(\delta,x) = f(x)+ \delta g(x)$ shows that for small $\delta$ the perturbed system has an equilibrium point $x_\delta$ , and $\lim_{\delta \to 0} x_\delta = x_0$ . Show that for small(er) $\delta$ , the eigenvalues of $A_\delta:={\partial \phi(\delta, x_\delta) \over \partial x}$ also have negative real parts. I am confused about how to show this perturbed matrix also has negative real parts for $\delta$ small enough. We know that as $\delta=0$ , the matrix $$A=\lim_{\delta\to 0}A_\delta=\frac{\partial f(x_0)}{\partial x}$$ has negative real parts. It seems one problem from Linear algebra...","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4801998,"What is the minimum convergence value, for $x>1$, of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^x}{x^n}$","I am a Calculus 2 student in college and we are learning about the tests for series convergence. One specific question caught my attention. We were to find if the following series is convergent or divergent: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^9}{9^n}.$$ I found it to be convergent, but I wondered what it converged to (this was outside of the scope of my course) and by putting it into a calculator found it to be about 138.3667. I was curious about what if instead of 9, it were other numbers and made a table similar to this: $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^x}{x^n}.$$ x   f(x)      
 -2  -0.44841

  3   4.12500   
  4   4.69136   
  5   6.90430 I was curious about how the function has a minimum between 2 and 4 and used a graphing calculator, Desmos, to see what that minimum is when $x$ is about 3.12 with is converging to about 4.113 I wanted to know if there was a closed form equation to the series for which I could take the derivative and set it to zero. I put the series was put into WolframAlpha; it outputted $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^x}{x^n} = \operatorname{Li}_{-x}(\frac{1}{x})$ when $|x|>1$ and $\operatorname{Li}_n(x)$ is the polylogarithm function. I realized I was getting over my head when I had no clue what a polylogarithm was and asked my Calc 2 instructor for help. Unfortunately, he said how he didn’t specialize in this kind of math called Analytic Number Theory. He asked some of his colleagues and none that he’d asked knew much about how to handle this. The only way I thing that was figured out was the derivative of the polylogarithm but for orders of numbers with absolute value less than 1; explicitly where the function diverged. He got back to me a few days later and recommend to ask the question on Stack Exchange (wow, that’s here!). We both don’t even know if taking the derivative of the polylogarithm is the way to go. Nor do we know of any other closed form equations for the series. I know I can just simply get arbitrarily close enough by computer algorithms to find when the derivative of the original function, $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^x}{x^n},$$ is 0, but I would really like to have an exact solution.","['number-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
