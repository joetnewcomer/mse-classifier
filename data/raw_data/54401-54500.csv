581386,Generalized distributive laws proof feedback,"I'm currently learning proofs and elementary set theory. I would like to have feedback on my proof since I'm self-studying. Are some part superfluous or unclear? My proof goes as follows: I will prove that $(\bigcap_i X_i)-A = \bigcap_i(X_i - A)$, where ""$-$"" is the set difference: Suppose that $x \in (\bigcap X_i) - A$, then $x \in \bigcap X_i$ but $x \notin A$. Therefore $x \in X_i$ for all $i$, and $x \notin A$, which means that for all $i$, $x \in X_i$ and $x \notin A$. Thus for all $i$ then $x \in X_i - A$, and as such $x \in \bigcap_i (X_i - A)$. I then proceed in the same way to show that $x \in \bigcap_i (X_i - A) \Longrightarrow x \in (\bigcap X_i) - A$. Since all elements in $(\bigcap_i X_i)-A$ are also in $\bigcap_i(X_i - A)$ and vice versa, then $(\bigcap_i X_i)-A = \bigcap_i(X_i - A)$. In (1.), I say that $x \notin A$ and $(\forall i) [x \in X_i]$ is equivalent to $(\forall i) [x \notin A$ and $x \in X_i]$ . Is it ok to make such a step or should it be proved too? And if so, how could it be proved? Thank you for your help!","['logic', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

581432,"If the roots of $ax^3 - x^2 + bx - 1$ are real and positive, prove $b \geq \sqrt{3}$","Let $$p(x) = ax^3 - x^2 + bx - 1$$ such that $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and the roots of $p(x)$ are real and positive. Prove that $$b \geq \sqrt{3}$$ Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$ be the roots of $p(x)$ $$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \sigma_1 = \frac{1}{a}$$ $$\alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha = \sigma_2 = \frac{b}{a}$$ $$\alpha\beta\gamma = \sigma_3 = \frac{1}{a}$$ Consider the inequality: $$\alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 \geq \alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha$$ Since the inequality is cyclic, we may assume $\alpha \geq \beta \geq \gamma$. Now, the above is clearly true by the rearrangement inequality. $$\implies \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2 \geq \sigma_2$$ $$\implies \sigma_1^2 \geq 3\sigma_2$$ $$\implies \frac{1}{a^2} \geq 3\frac{b}{a}$$ $$\implies 1 \geq 3ab \tag{1}$$ Now, from the AM-GM inequality: $$\alpha + \beta + \gamma \geq 3\sqrt[3]{\alpha\beta\gamma}$$ Since $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \alpha\beta\gamma$, $$\alpha^3\beta^3\gamma^3 \geq 27\alpha\beta\gamma$$ $$\implies \alpha\beta\gamma = \frac{1}{a} \geq 3\sqrt{3}$$ $$\implies \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} \geq a$$ Putting this in $(1)$, we get: $$3ab \leq \frac{b}{\sqrt{3}}$$ We know that $3ab \leq 1$, but we can't say that $\frac{b}{\sqrt{3}}\leq 1$ as well.

581591,Area of a right angled triangle is an even integer,"Actual Question is : Let $ABC$ be a triangle in the plane such that $BC$ is perpendicular to $AC$. Let $a,b,c$ be the lengths of $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ respectively. Suppose that $a,b,c$ are integers and have no common divisor other than $1$. Which of the following statements are necessarily true? a. Either $a$ or $b$ is an even integer. b. The area of the triangle $ABC$ is an even integer. c. Either $a$ or $b$ is divisible by $3$. With this information, I could see that right angle is at $C$ and $AB=c$, $BC=a$, $AB=c$. First of all I should check that either $a$ or $b$ is even. Suppose not, then we would have $(2n+1)^2+(2m+1)^2=c^2$ i.e., $4n^2+4m^2+4n+4m+2=c^2 \Rightarrow 2(2n^2+2m^2+2n+2m+1)=c^2$ i.e., $2$ divides $c^2$ i.e., $2$ divides $c$ i.e., $2^2$ divide $c^2$ i.e., $4$ divides $c^2$ but then, $4n^2+4m^2+4n+4m+2=c^2$ so, going modulo $4$ we see that $\bar{2}\equiv\bar{0} \text{ mod } 4$ which is false. So, at least one of $a,b$ has to be even integer. This does not immediately imply that area is even integer (sq.units) because $\text {Area} =\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b$ Suppose $a$ or $b$ has only $1$ as power of $2$ in its prime decomposition, then $2$ in numerator and denominator gets cancelled out which may not give an even integer.

581699,Is there a gap in Serre's proof of inverse function theorem?,"On page 73 of 'Lie algebras and Lie groups', Serre proves the inverse function theorem for complete fields. I would like to have some clarification about the following point. Let $K$ be a complete ultrametric field. Let $f = (f_1,\dots,f_n)$ be an $n$-uple of formal power series in $n$ variables (i.e. $f_i \in K[[X_1, \dots,X_n]]$). Suppose that $f$ is convergent and that $D_0 f$ is invertible. Serre proves that there exists $g=(g_1,\dots,g_n)$ a formal power series convergent satisfying : $f \circ g(\underline{T}) = \underline{T} = (T_1,\dots,T_n)$ as formal power series (and also satisfying $g \circ f(\underline{T}) = \underline{T} = (T_1,\dots,T_n)$ if I am not mistaken). Serre ends the proof here. Why does this prove the theorem ? To conclude, we have to prove that there exist two opens $U,V$ such that $f$ maps U into $V$ and $g$ maps $V$ into $U$.

581702,Correspondence between eigenvalues and eigenvectors in ellipsoids,"think of an ellipsoid in the n-dimensional space defined by
$$(x-\mu)'A(x-\mu)=1.$$ I was calculating the volumes of n-dimensional ellipsoids like the one from above for a while, which is straightforward once the eigenvalues of matrix $A$ are retrieved. The volume $V$ is then given by (using the log scale so that it will not create numerical problems for very large $n$)
$$ V_{0} = log(1),\\
V_{1} = log(2),
$$
and then for any $i>1$ $$
V_{i} = log(\frac{2\pi}{i-1}) + V_{i-2},$$
and finally
$$V = V_{n} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} log(\lambda_{i}^{-\frac{1}{2}}),$$
where each $\lambda_{i}$ refers to one of the $n$ eigenvalues of $A$. Now we know that each eigenvector of $A$ is the orientation of an axis of the ellipsoid and each $\lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ refers to the half length of one of these axes. Nevertheless, most (all that I know) mathematical routines that calculate the eigenvalues of $A$ will give the result in a meaningless order. Thus, I will know all half length of the axes of the ellipsoid, but I do not know which eigenvalue corresponds to which eigenvector. I can find this out (I guess) when testing for each eigenvector $v_{k}$ if
$$ Av_{k}=\lambda_{i}v_{k}$$
and the $\lambda_{i}$ for which the above holds, will then be the eigenvalue corresponding to $v_{k}$.
Nevertheless, my software (R) return eigenvectors normalized to length 1, so the above identity never exists. My question would be if someone could help me to find out how to sort the eigenvalues anyway so that the first eigenvalue corresponds to the first eigenvector and so on...

581912,Homogeneous riemannian manifolds are complete. Trouble understanding proof.,"I came across this proof while looking for hints on my homework, and I think it's only gotten me more confused. This is from Global Lorentzian Geometry . Lemma 5.4 If $(H,h)$ is a homogeneous Riemannian manifold, then $(H,h)$ is complete. Proof. By the Hopf-Rinow Theorem, it suffices to show that $(H,h)$ is geodesically complete. Thus suppose that $c:[a,1) \rightarrow H$ is a unit speed geodesic which is not extendible to $t=1$ . Choosing any $p \in H$ , we may find a constant $\alpha > 0$ such that any unit speed geodesic starting at $p$ has length $\ell \geq \alpha$ . Set $\delta = \min\{\alpha/2, (1-a)/2\} > 0$ . Since isometries preserve geodesics, it follows from the homogeneity of $(H,h)$ that any unit speed geodesic starting at $c(1-\delta)$ may be extended to a geodesic of length $\ell \geq 2 \delta$ . In particular, $c$ may be extended to a geodesic $c:[a, 1+\delta) \rightarrow H$ , in contradiction to the inextendibility of $c$ to $t=1$ . How exactly does it ""follow from homogeneity"" that we are able to extend unit speed geodesics? Isn't that what we're trying to show in the lemma? And how does considering geodesics based at $c(1-\delta)$ lead us to extending $c$ to $c:[a,1+\delta) \rightarrow H$ ?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
581935,Dehn and Wirtinger Presentations of Knot Groups and their connection,"I'm currently working through N.D. Gilbert and T. Porter's Knots and Surfaces . In it the idea of a Wirtinger presentation and a Dehn presentation for a group associated with a given knot is introduced. It then says that: Both presentations are a presentation of the same group. I'm trying to prove this statement but I'm not sure how exactly I would go about it. Is it enough to show that generators for one both generate and satisfy the relations for the other? I'm only looking at tame knots, and so we can assume that for a knot $K$ there are a finite number of generators for the Wirtinger presentation, say $n$ many, and from this we know that there are $n+2$ many generators for the Dehn presentation, via Euler's formula (for planar graphs). (Is this much correct?) Also a Wirtinger presentation gives relations of the form $xyx^{-1}z^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}yxz^{-1}$, whereas a Dehn relation is always of the form $ab^{-1}cd^{-1}$, as well as the one relation of setting one generator equal to the identity. Am I thinking about it the right way? And are my preliminary assumptions correct?

581998,Analytic/Smooth/Continuous maps between a manifold and itself,"Let us suppose that $M_{\omega}$ is a connected real-analytic manifold of dimension $n$. Then there is an associated smooth structure, $\mathcal{C}^r$ structure ($r$ non-negative integer) on it.
Let $G_{\omega}$ denote the group of analytic functions from $M_{\omega}$ to itself which have an analytic inverse. Let $G_{\infty}, G_{r}$ be defined similarly. My questions are 1.) What is known about the groups defined above ? (Anything about their structure, their interesting subgroups, or their homomorphic images etc.) It appears to me that all the groups defined above are very big in general. For example in case $M=\mathbb{R}$, the group $G_{\omega}$ contains all maps of the type $x \to x+ \mu Sin (f(x))$ where $\mu$ is sufficiently small and $f(x)$ is analytic with bounded derivative. So it appears that this group is too big to be a finite dimensional Lie group. 2.) Is there a natural way to give these groups a manifold structure so as to make them 'infinite dimensional Lie groups' ? 3.) Are there conditions on $M$ which would ensure that any of these groups is a finite dimensional Lie group ? If I am not making a mistake, in case $M=\mathbb{R}^n$, the action of each of these groups on $M$ is $p$-transitive where $p$ is any positive integer. 4.) Does it generalize to the general case where $M$ is not a Euclidean space ? Is the action of any of these groups 'infinity transitive' i.e. given two arbitrary sequences $\{ a_i\}$, $\{ b_i\}$ which have no limit point, does there exist an element of any of these groups which takes the sequence $\{ a_i\}$ to $\{ b_i\}$ ? Can we answer this question in specific cases (e.g. $M$ Euclidean) if not in general case ? 5.) One can look at the vector space of all real valued analytic/smooth/continuous functions defined on $M$. These vector spaces are also infinite dimensional in general. Is there a good description of the quotient of any of these vector spaces e.g. analytic functions modulo smooth functions ? Please feel free to answer other natural related questions in these directions. It would be great if somebody could advise me some good references (books/articles/lecture notes) which addresses these or similar questions. I had come across a book 'Continuous Groups of Transformations' by L.P.Eisenhart though am not sure what exactly it deals with and had asked a question about it here .

582136,Inclusion-Exclusion Problem about arrangements,"I had 2 questions about using the inclusion-exclusion method to solve arrangements: How many arrangements of the 26 different letters are there that a) Contain either the sequence ""the"" or the sequence ""aid"" b) Contain neither the sequence ""the"" or the sequence ""math""? How many ways are there to arrange the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI so that either all the Is are consecutive or all the Ss are consecutive or all the Ps are consecutive This is my guesses on the two questions, would someone be able to check my work on this and see if I'm right? a) There are 26 letters of the alphabet, therefore there are $26!$ possible arrangements that can be made. Thus $N(U)$ (which is the number of elements in the universe) is $26!$. By the same token, the number of sequences containing the word ""the"" ($N(A_{the}))$ is $23!$ because out of the 26 letters, you have taken out 3. Thus leaving a total of 23 letters to arrange. Also, $N(A_{aid})$ is $23!$ because again 3 letters of the 26 letter of the alphabet have been moved and already arranged. Therefore, when talking about the number of arrangements that contain either ""the"" or ""aid"" we have $N(A_{the} U A_{aid})$ = $N(A_{the}) + N(A_{aid}) - N(A_{the} intersect A_{aid})$ = $(23!) + (23!) -(20!) = 5.17*10^{22}$ b) The universe, as said earlier is $26!$. In addition, $N(A_{the}) = 23!$ and $N(A_{math}) = 22!$. Therefore, the arrangement of the 6 letters in the 26 letter alphabet ($N(A_{the} U A_{math})$) is $20!$. Also, because In this particular context, we are trying to find $N(Not(A_{the}) intersect Not(A_{math})) = N -N(A_{the}) - N(A_{math}) + N(A_{the} U A_{math})$ which comes out to be $(26!) - (23!) - (22!) + (20!) = 4.03*10^{26}$ The universe, or the arrangment of the 11 letters comes out to be $11!$. Therefore The arrangment of I's ($N(A_I)$) = $7!$, the arrangement of P's ($N(A_P)$) = $9!$ and the arrangment of S's ($N(A_S)$) = $7!$. Therefore $N(A_I U A_P U A_S) = N(A_I) + N(A_P) + N(A_S) - N(A_I intersect A_P) - N(A_I intersect A_S) - N(A_P intersect A_S) + N(A_I U A_P U A_S) = (7!) + (9!) + (7!) - (5!)-(3!)-(5!) + (1) = 372715$ Is my work or thought process correct?

582182,Definition of Integral in Measure Theory,"I am trying to understand how ""the"" general integral is defined in measure theory but I just don't get it. I'm using Friedman's ""Foundations of Modern Analysis"". A simple function $g=\sum \beta_i 1_{E_i}$ is integrable if $\mu(E_i)<\infty$ for all $i$, and the integral of $g$ is $\int g \space d\mu := \sum \beta_i \mu(E_i)$. If $E$ is a measurable set and $f$ an integrable simple function, the integral of $f$ over $E$ is $\int_E f \space d\mu := \int f \space 1_E \space d\mu$. Since $f$ is simple, it can be written as $f=\sum \alpha_i 1_{E_i}$ (for what $E_i$?). We then have $\int_E f \space d\mu= \int 1_E (\sum \alpha_i 1_{E_i})d\mu$. The presence of both $1_E$ and the $1_{E_i}$ causes me some trouble but I think the integral comes out as $\sum \alpha_i \mu(E \cap E_i)$. This is quite constructive. Now then, a measurable function $f:\Box \rightarrow \bar{\mathbb{R}}$ is said to be integrable if there exists a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of simple integrable function such that $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the mean and $\mathrm{lim} f_n(x)=f(x)$ a.e. (or the sequence converges in measure to $f$). This is not quite as constructive. Forgetting the high school stuff for a moment, none of this really tells me how to integrate even a constant function, how would I do that with the above information?

A function $f : D \to D$ is holomorphic iff it has the following property: for any three points in $D$, there exists a holomorphic function $g : D \to D$ that agrees with $f$ at the three points. I'm interested in the proof. One direction is trivial, and for the other direction, the post says that there is an ""easy"" but clever proof using only Schwarz's lemma and Montel's theorem. So I suppose the general idea is to look at the family of functions $g$ that are holomorphic and agree with $f$ at three or more points, and to find, within this family, a sequence that converges to $f$. At first I thought this might require an enumeration of a countable dense subset of $D$, but now I think maybe it's possible to show that $f$ is differentiable at $0$, and use a Möbius transformations such that $z_0 \mapsto 0$ to show differentiability at $z_0 \neq 0$.

So it seems that these two forms should differ in the case where an element of the domain is neither in a nor b. Using the conjunction form, this case makes the main conditional of the axiom  vacuously true ($False\rightarrow True$).

Atempt: I am trying to use Rouche's Theorem, but I am stuck on a particular step. Let $z_0\in U$. Since $f'(z_0)\neq 0$, there is a disc $D_r(z_0)\subseteq U$ such that
$$f(z)=f(z_0)+(z-z_0)h(z),\quad\forall z\in D_r(z_0)$$
where $h$ is holomorphic on $D_r(z_0)$ and $h(z)\neq 0$ for all $z\in D_r(z_0)$. Let $0<\varepsilon<r$ to be defined later and fix $w\in D_\varepsilon(z_0)$. To show that $f$ is injective in $D_\varepsilon(z_0)$ is to show that the function $f(z)-f(w)$ has exactly one zero in $D_\varepsilon(z_0)$. But
$$F(z):=(z-z_0)h(z)$$
has exactly one zero in $D_\varepsilon(z_0)$, so we might want to apply Rouche's Theorem with $F$ and
$$G(z):=f(z)-f(w)-(z-z_0)h(z)=f(z_0)-f(w)=-(w-z_0)h(w)$$
to conclude that $F$ and $F+G$ have the same number of zeros and hence $f$ is injective. But that means that we need to find $0<\varepsilon<r$ such that $|G(z)|<|F(z)|$ on $\partial D_\varepsilon(z_0)$. That is,
$$|w-z_0||h(w)|<|z-z_0||h(z)|$$
for all $w\in D_\varepsilon(z_0)$ and $z\in\partial D_\varepsilon(z_0)$. Can we find such $\varepsilon>0$? It seems intuitive since if we expand $h$ in a power series at $z_0$, $h(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n$, then
$$|w-z_0||h(w)| = |w-z_0|\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n|w-z_0|^n < |z-z_0|\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n|z-z_0|^n.$$

In the case of permutations, if we are selecting the entire set ($nPn$), then I think it makes sense to effectively treat it like a combination in the sense that each of $k$ types has some number of copies whose order doesn't matter, so the solution would be $\dfrac{n!}{\Pi_{i=1}^k (p_i !)}$. How do we do this calculation when we are not selecting the entire set, and therefore we do not know how many repeats there will be? What if we're interested in combinations instead, so the order doesn't matter? These seem like they should be computable, but I haven't been able to wrap my head around how.

How to prove from the general solution that the trajectories will spiral out? Let us transform the coordinate system. Transformation matrix will be $T = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 \end{array} \right]$. New system of equation will be $$\left[\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\ y_2\end{array}\right]' = \left[\begin{array}{c c} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\ y_2\end{array}\right]$$ Corresponding general solution will be $$\left[ \begin{array}{c} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{array} \right] = C_1 e^x \left(\begin{array}{c} \cos(3x) \\ \sin(3x) \end{array} \right) + C_2 e^x \left(\begin{array}{c} \sin(3x) \\ \cos(3t) \end{array} \right)$$ Here it is easy to prove that the trajectories will spiral out.

582927,Does $\Bbb Q/ \Bbb Z$ have a proper subgroup that is not finite?,Does $\Bbb Q/ \Bbb Z$ have a proper subgroup that is not finite? I suspect it does not. However since we could take a subgroup of all $p$ sets $\{\frac{1}{p} + \Bbb Z\}$ if we consider $p$ to be arbitrarily large is this the same thing as a non-finite subgroup?,"['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"
582931,How prove this $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=n\pi$,"let $\theta\in R$,and $\alpha\neq\beta\neq\gamma$
and such
$$\dfrac{\cos{(\alpha+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\alpha}}=\dfrac{\cos{(\beta+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\beta}}=\dfrac{\cos{(\gamma+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\gamma}}$$ prove 
$$\alpha+\beta+\gamma=n\pi$$ My try: let
$$\dfrac{\cos{(\alpha+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\alpha}}=\dfrac{\cos{(\beta+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\beta}}=\dfrac{\cos{(\gamma+\theta)}}{\sin^3{\gamma}}=k$$
then
$$\cos{(\alpha+\theta)}=k\sin^3{\alpha},\quad
\cos{(\beta+\theta)}=k\sin^3{\beta},\quad\cos{(\gamma+\theta)}=k\sin^3{\gamma}$$
so
$$\cos{(\alpha-\beta)}=\cos{[(\alpha+\theta)-(\beta+\theta)]}=\cos{(\alpha+\theta)}\cos{(\beta+\theta)}+\sin{(\alpha+\theta)}\sin{(\beta+\theta)}$$
and follow maybe can't work.Thank you",['trigonometry']
582939,On asymptotics for the number of ways to write $2n$ as the sum of two primes,"Let $g(n)$ be the number of ways to write $2n$ as the sum of two primes. Define $G(n) = g(2) + \cdot \cdot \cdot + g(n)$. Are there any conjectured or known asymptotics or bounds for $G(n)$? Especifically, is it known or conjectured that $G(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{\log(n)^2}$?","['prime-numbers', 'analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

582945,"In statistics, why do you reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is less than the alpha value (the level of significance)","This is a question that I've always wondered in statistics, but never had the guts to ask the professor. The professor would say that if the p-value is less than or equal to the level of significance (denoted by alpha) we reject the null hypothesis because the test statistic falls in the rejection region. When I first learned this, I did not understand why were comparing the p values to the alpha values. After all, the alpha values were brought in arbitrarily. What is the reason for comparing them to the alpha values and where do the alpha values of 0.05 and 0.10 come from? Why does the statement $ p_\text{value} \leq \alpha$ allow you to reject $H_0$?","['statistics', 'hypothesis-testing', 'statistical-inference']"
582974,Isn't codomain of a function ambiguous?,"I understand what domain and image of a function are, and believe those terms to be well-defined. I have read that range is ambiguous, so I avoid it. However for any given function the image has infinitely many supersets. It seems rather arbitrary to me which one we pick to be the codomain. Is it governed by some informal convention of mathematicians? Clearly, $\Bbb N$, $\Bbb R$, and $\Bbb C$ are popular, hence the symbols. However if, say, $\Bbb N$ is the codomain of the floor function, than it can just as well be $\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$. In case of numbers you could argue, that one should pick the most restrictive among $\Bbb N$ and $\Bbb R$ and $\Bbb C$, but what about functions that do not evaluate to numbers?",['functions']
582986,Lie algebra homomorphism and action on a manifold,"In Introduction to smooth manifolds Lee says on page 527: If $\mathfrak{g}$ is an arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebra, any Lie algebra homomorphism $\hat{\theta}:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is called a (right) $\mathfrak{g}$-action on $M$ . [$M$ is supposed to be a smooth manifold.] Basically, I want to understand how fundamental vector fields $\hat{X}\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$, given by
$$\hat{X}(p)=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}p\exp(tX)\right|_{t=0}$$
for $X\in\mathfrak{g}$ and $p\in M$, ""describe the infinitesimal behaviour of a smooth Lie group action on a smooth manifold"" (source: Wikipedia ). While I have managed to understand that the map $X\in\mathfrak{g}\mapsto\hat{X}\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is a Lie-Algebra homomorphism, I struggle to understand how it is justified to call a Lie algebra homomorphism an action on $M$. After a short search I haven't found anything helpful concerning this particular question. My questions seems to be related to that question on the Lie-Palais theorem . Since I am pretty new to Lie theory, I would be glad about a clarification and/or any references on this (particular) subject.","['manifolds', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
