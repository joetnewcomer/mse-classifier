2182228,"Ms Black, Ms Blue and Ms Green - Is there really a unique answer?","This puzzle appeared in an article by Martin Gardner.  It goes like this: Miss green, Miss Black and Miss Blue are out for a stroll together.  One is wearing a green dress, one a black dress and the other a blue dress.  ""Isn't it odd"" says Miss Blue, ""that our dresses match our last names, but not one of us is wearing a dress that matches her own name"". The question is $$What\ color\ is\ each\ lady's\ dress$$ $$ $$ The solution offered in various places on the net is: $$ $$ $$
\begin{array}{c|lcr}
\text{L/C} & \text{Black} & \text{Blue} & \text{Green} \\
\hline
\text{Ms. Black} & \text{.} & \text{Y} & \text{.} \\
\text{Ms. Blue} & \text{.} & \text{.} & \text{Y} \\
\text{Ms. Green} & \text{Y} & \text{.} & \text{.}
\end{array}
$$
$$ $$ This gives the impression that this brain teaser has a unique solution but, I don't believe that is the case.  If one reflects the above solution along the diagonal, that produces a second solution which must be correct if the first one was correct.$$ $$ $$
\begin{array}{c|lcr}

It seems obvious (to me) that this problem has 2 solutions, not just one, as this brainteaser implies by simply asking ""What color is each lady's dress"".  That said, I thought I'd ask this question in case there is something I have missed. Specifically, does this problem have a unique solution or not ? Edit The original puzzle adds $$""so\ what"" said\ the\ lady\ in\ black$$
which causes the puzzle to have a unique solution. See the answer by lulu below which explains why that statement makes a difference.  I originally omitted that part of the puzzle because I mistakenly read: ""so what"" said Miss Black, which makes no difference unlike when the question is asked by the lady in black (not Miss Black).",['combinatorics']

2182321,The best worst case scenario in MasterMind,"In the game of MasterMind , you are trying to guess a sequence of colours.  After each guess, your guess is graded: you find out how many are exactly right, and how many others are the right colour but out of sequence. In an actual game, it's possible to get very lucky and simply guess the correct answer on your first attempt. In a computer simulation, on the other hand, it's possible for the computer to change the correct answer without telling you, as long as it doesn't contradict any previous information it has given you.  I.e. the computer is forcing a worst case scenario upon the guesser.  I've written just such a simulation here: https://github.com/IBwWG/cheatermind My question for you is this: Is it possible, given a configuration of $C >= 2$ colours and $S >= 1$ slots, to determine a formula for the minimum number of moves one would have to make to win against a computer that's cheating this way? For example, the simplest configuration (like a coin toss) would have $M(2,1) = 2$, because the first guess will always be wrong, leaving only one other possibility.  No matter what you guess, it will take a minimum of two guesses to win.","['combinatorics', 'optimization']"

2182661,"Covariant derivative of a $(1,1)$ tensor field","I am trying to understand covariant derivatives in GR. So far, I understand that if $Z$ is a vector field, $\nabla Z$ is a $(1,1)$ tensor field, i.e. the map $\eta,X \mapsto \eta(\nabla_XZ)$ is linear in $\eta$ and $X$ . The map $Z\mapsto\nabla_XZ$ is not a tensor field since, by the Leibniz rule, it is not linear in $Z$ : $$\nabla_X(fZ)=(\nabla_Xf)Z+f(\nabla_XZ)$$ where $\nabla_Xf:=X(f)$ .
My lecture notes then state that the action of $\nabla$ is extended to general $(r,s)$ tensor fields by the Leibniz rule, giving an $(r,s+1)$ tensor field as a result. The example given is $\nabla \eta$ , with $\eta$ a $(0,1)$ tensor field: $$(\nabla\eta)(X,Y)\equiv\nabla_X\eta(Y):=\nabla_X(\eta(Y))-\eta(\nabla_XY)$$ which is easily seen to be linear in $X$ , while the first terms from the Leibniz rule cancel to give linearity in $Y$ as well, so this is a $(0,2)$ tensor. They then suggest to try and define $\nabla T$ for $T$ a $(1,1)$ tensor. My attempt at this is: $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))+T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)-T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ Again, linearity in $X$ is easy and the Leibniz rule gives linearity in $Y$ . However, this doesn't seem to be linear in $\eta$ . First, I find that: $$\begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_X(f\eta+\omega) (Y)&=& \nabla_X((f\eta+\omega)(Y)) - (f\eta+\omega)(\nabla_XY)\\
&=& (\nabla_Xf)\eta(Y)+f\nabla_X(\eta(Y))+\nabla_X(\omega(Y))-f\eta(\nabla_XY)-\omega(\nabla_XY)\\
&=& (\nabla_Xf)\eta(Y) + f \nabla_X\eta(Y)+\nabla_X\omega(Y)
\end{eqnarray}$$ hence $\nabla_X(f\eta+\omega) = (\nabla_Xf)\eta + f \nabla_X\eta+\nabla_X\omega$ . Therefore: $$\begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_XT(f\eta+\omega,Y)&=& \nabla_X(T(f\eta+\omega,Y))+T(\nabla_X(f\eta+\omega),Y)-T(f\eta+\omega,\nabla_XY)\\
&=& (\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y))+f\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))+\nabla_X(T(\omega,Y))+(\nabla_Xf)T(\eta,Y)\\&&+fT(\nabla_X\eta,Y)+T(\nabla_X\omega,Y)-fT(\eta,\nabla_XY)-T(\omega,\nabla_XY)\\
&=& 2(\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y)) + f\nabla_XT(\eta,Y)+\nabla_XT(\omega,Y)
\end{eqnarray}$$ where the term $2(\nabla_Xf)(T(\eta,Y))$ shows that $\nabla_XT(\eta,Y)$ is not linear in $\eta$ . However, if I defined it as: $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))-T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)+T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ instead, then the same calculation shows that this is linear in $\eta$ , but no longer linear in $Y$ . So I am not sure which, if either, of them is the correct definition. UPDATE: Thanks to Michael Albanese's answer I now understand that the correct definition is $$\nabla_XT(\eta,Y):=\nabla_X(T(\eta,Y))-T(\nabla_X\eta,Y)-T(\eta,\nabla_XY)$$ which is indeed linear in $\eta$ , $X$ and $Y$ . For the benefit of others, I'll mention that my confusion arose because I was trying to reverse engineer the $+$ and $-$ signs from the coordinate basis formula: $$\begin{eqnarray} 
T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s};\rho} =T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s},\rho}&+\Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\rho}T^{{\sigma}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s}}+\ldots+\Gamma^{\mu_r}_{\sigma\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\sigma}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\nu_s}}\\ &-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu_1\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\sigma}\ldots{\nu_s}}-\ldots-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu_s\rho}T^{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}_{\phantom{{\mu_1}\ldots{\mu_r}}{\nu_1}\ldots{\sigma}}
\end{eqnarray}$$ But I now see how they follow from the correct definition. In the case of a $(1,1)$ tensor we have $T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu\,;\rho}:=\nabla_{e_\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\nu)$ , where I am using $f^\mu$ and $e_\nu$ for $\mathrm{d}x^\mu$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}$ . Hence we have: $$\begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_{e_\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\nu) :=& \nabla_{e_\rho}(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))-T(\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu,e_\nu)-T(f^\mu,\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\nu)
\end{eqnarray}$$ The first and third terms are easily evaluated: $$\nabla_{e_\rho}(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))=e_\rho(T(f^\mu,e_\nu))=e_\rho(T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu})=T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu,\rho}$$ $$T(f^\mu,\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\nu)=T(f^\mu,\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}e_\sigma)=\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T(f^\mu,e_\sigma)=\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T^\mu_{\phantom{\mu}\sigma}$$ For the second term, since $f^\mu$ is a $(0,1)$ tensor field, $\nabla f^\mu$ is a $(0,2)$ tensor field and hence $\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu$ , for fixed $e_\rho$ , is a $(0,1)$ tensor field. We evaluate: $$\begin{eqnarray} 
(\nabla_{e_\rho} f^\mu)_\lambda=\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu(e_\lambda) &:= &\nabla_{e_\rho}(f^\mu(e_\lambda))-f^\mu(\nabla_{e_\rho}e_\lambda)  \\
&= & e_\rho(\delta^\mu_\lambda)-f^\mu(\Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma e_\sigma)\\
&= & 0 -\Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma f^\mu( e_\sigma)\\
&= & - \Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\sigma \delta^\mu_\sigma\\
&= & - \Gamma_{\lambda\rho}^\mu \\
&= & - \Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu \delta^\sigma_\lambda\\
&= &  -\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma( e_\lambda)\\
\end{eqnarray}$$ Therefore $\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu =  -\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma$ and hence: $$T(\nabla_{e_\rho}f^\mu,e_\nu)=T(-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu f^\sigma,e_\nu)=-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T(f^\sigma,e_\nu)=-\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T^\sigma_{\phantom{\sigma}\nu}$$ Thus, we have: $$\nabla_\rho T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu}=T^{\mu}_{\phantom{\mu}\nu,\rho}+\Gamma_{\sigma\rho}^\mu T^\sigma_{\phantom{\sigma}\nu}-\Gamma^{\sigma}_{\nu\rho}T^\mu_{\phantom{\mu}\sigma}$$ as expected.","['tensors', 'differential-geometry', 'general-relativity', 'connections']"

2182893,"If $f$ an isometry on $M$ s.t. $f(p)=p$ and $(df)_p=\mathrm{id}_{T_p M}$, then $f=\mathrm{id}_M$","A sketch of the proof of this is provided here , though many of the details are incomplete, and I'm having a certain amount of difficulty filling in the gaps. Note that we require $M$ to be connected (obviously). For clarity, I repeat the question in full below. Proposition (which I wish to prove) : Let $(M,g)$ be an $n$-dimensional topologically-connected Riemannian manifold, let $f:M\to M$ be an isometry (i.e. $f^*g = g$), and suppose there exists some point $p\in M$ such that $f(p) = p$, and $(\mathrm{d}f)_p = \mathrm{id}_{\mathrm{T}_p M}$. I claim that $f = \mathrm{id}_M$. The proof goes as follows: we define $$X = \{ q\in M\ \vert\ f(q) = q,\ (\mathrm{d}f)_q = \mathrm{id}_{\mathrm{T}_q M}\}$$ so that $X$ is easily seen to be closed, and is nonempty by assumption, so that we must prove that it is open. To do so, let $q\in X$ be arbitrary, and let $$\mathrm{exp}_q:\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{T}_q M}(0,\varepsilon)\to\mathrm{B}_M(q,\varepsilon)\subseteq M$$ be a diffeomorphism defining a normal neighborhood $\mathrm{B}_M(q,\varepsilon)$, then we will prove that $\mathrm{B}_M(q,\varepsilon)\subseteq X$ for $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small. Note that since isometries preserve geodesics, then $$f(\mathrm{exp}_q(tv)) = \mathrm{exp}_{f(q)}(t\,f_*v)$$ and therefore for any $r = \mathrm{exp}_q(v)\in\mathrm{B}_M(q,\varepsilon)$ we have that $$f(r) = f(\mathrm{exp}_q(v)) = \mathrm{exp}_{f(q)}(f_* v) = \mathrm{exp}_q v = r$$ so it suffices to prove now that there exists some $\varepsilon$ such that for all $r\in\mathrm{B}_M(q,\varepsilon)$, $(\mathrm{d}f)_r = \mathrm{id}_{\mathrm{T}_r M}$, however, I don't see how this is obvious, and Jason DeVito's explanation (drawing a triangle between $r$, $q$, and $\mathrm{exp}_q(v)$ for some $v$ such that $(\mathrm{d}f)_r v\ne v$) doesn't seem at all clear to me.

To her, $X$ is a metric space and $G$ is a group of homeomorphisms of $X$, not necessarily isometries . Right before this theorem, she comments that $G$ acts properly discontinuously on $X$ if, and only if, each $G$-orbit, namely $G(x)=\{g(x)\in X\,|\,g\in G\}$, is a discrete subset of $X$ and the stabilizer, namely $G_x=\{g\in G\,|\,g(x)=x\}$, of each point $x\in X$ is finite. This fact is okay, I could prove it, just considering $G$ as a group of homeomorphisms. Let's take a look at Katok's proof of theorem 2.2.1: Proof: Suppose $G$ acts properly discontinuously on $X$, then each $G(x)$ is discrete, and for each point $x\in X$, $G_x$ is finite. This implies that for any point $x$ there exists a ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ centered at $x$ of radius $\epsilon$ containing no points of $G(x)$ other than $x$.

In fact, making some drawings I started to doubt of the validity of this claim (since $T$ is just a homeomorphism , it can distort metric and ""melt"" all the figure, circles, etc). Although, if $G$ is a group of isometries, the proof of this fact is easy... So this is my question: is it suffice $G$ to be a group of homeomorphisms in order to ensure Theorem 2.2.1 or is it needed to require it is a group of isometries instead? I've saw some similar questions on the site, but I want to know if the homeomorphism hypothesis is or not sufficient to get the result... This is not clear to me yet. Edit: If, in addition to the homeomorphism hypothesis, $G$ is also equicontinuous, then $G$ acts properly descontinuously if, and only if, there is such a neighborhood $V$. But is necessary to require this? What is the minimal set of hypothesis that I need to add in order to have the theorem? Edit 2: A group of isometries is, of course, (uniformly) equicontinuous. Edit 3: Definition: (Katok's definition of properly discontinuous action) We say that a group $G$ acts properly discontinuously on $X$ if the $G$-orbit of any point $x\in X$ is locally finite. This means that, for any compact set $K\subset X$ the set $\{g\in G\,|\,g(x)\in K\neq \emptyset\}$ is finite, and this holds for every $x\in X$.","['group-actions', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'isometry']"

So I thought that $2a = 1$, since if $2a = 0$ or $2a = a$, then $a = 0$, which is contradictory to the statement that the field has exactly 3 elements. Then it's concluded that $a = 1/2$, but if that's true, $1 + 1/2 = 3/2$ also has to be in this field, but it's not. Therefore I concluded that it can't be an ordered field.

Consider an $m$ by $n$ matrix filled with integers in $\left[0, b\right[$. There would be $b^{mn}$ possible matrices. Two matrices would be considered equivalent (in this system) iff you can switch some rows and columns in the matrix and they are the same (So the order doesn't matter). For example: $$
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\
 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 1 \\
 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$ How can you get the number of unique matrices? For $n=m=b=2$, the number of unique matrices is $7$: $$\text{(The above example)}\tag1$$$$
\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}\tag2$$$$
\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\1&0\end{bmatrix}\tag3$$$$

\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\1&1\end{bmatrix}\tag7$$ For $n=2; m=3; b=4$, the answer is $430$. How would I go about calculating this? Progress (Using $n=2; m=3; b=4$ as an example) You can create a set of possible rows $N$. This would have $b^m$ items and start: {(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), ...} Which will be written: {N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, ...} Then, matrices can be defined as of $n$ items in $N$, being rows. Since the order of the rows do not matter, it can be a multiset. So, the first few matrices would be: {{N_0, N_0}, {N_0, N_1}, {N_0, N_2}, ...} Before removing duplicates, there would be $\left(b^m\right)^n=b^{mn}$ of these. After removing duplicates there would be $\begin{pmatrix}n+b^m-1\\n\end{pmatrix}$ (Choose $n$ rows from $b^m$ possible with repeats) matrices with unique rows. Some of these would have more than one unique matrix defined by the same rows but with different columns. So, for each one, I would have to look at the number of unique ways to define them as columns. I don't know how I would go about this in a timely manner. I then found out about Burnside's Lemma , which I got that that $$|X/G|=\frac1{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|X^g|$$ Where $|X/G|$ is the number of oribits (Or unique matrices), $X$ is the set of all possible matrices (So $|X|=b^{mn}$), $G$ is a group of ""the actions"", like swapping some rows and / or columns, and $X^g$ is the set of the matrices in $X$ where applying the action $g$ leaves the matrix unchanged, but I could not figure out how to calculate the group of possible actions.","['matrices', 'combinatorics', 'permutation-matrices']"

The ""size"" of any such intersection is, naturally, the sum of the lengths of these intervals. Consider a nice region R. The ""cross section of R along the z-axis"" is the (nonnegative) function h given by: C(t) := size of the cross section of R at the (horizontal) line z = t Similarly, we can define the cross section of R at an arbitrary line. Here are a couple of questions with (almost) obvious answers: Question 1: Given a nonnegative function h, does there exist a nice region whose cross section (along some line) is h? Answer 1: Yes, always. (easy) Question 2: Given two nonnegative functions g, h and two lines k, l, does there exist a nice region R whose cross sections along k, l are g, h (respectively)? Answer 2: Depends. Not hard to come up with examples for both possible answers.

Then both $n$ and $m$ must have the same prime divisors and so we can let $$n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_n^{\alpha_n} \quad \text{and} \quad m = p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2} \cdots p_n^{\beta_n}.$$ Note that $d(n) = (\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1) \cdots (\alpha_n+1)$ and $d(m) = (\beta_1+1)(\beta_2+1) \cdots (\beta_n+1)$ and so we need $$\alpha_i(\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1) \cdots (\alpha_n+1) = \beta_i(\beta_1+1)(\beta_2+1) \cdots (\beta_n+1)$$ for each $i$.

2184132,Linear transformation maps the first quadrant to a closed set,"My question is Let $A: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation, how can one prove that $\{Ay|y\geq 0\}$ is a closed set? Here $y\geq 0$ means each component of $y$ $\geq 0$ . I can simplify the question in two ways Since the image of $A$ is a closed linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ , by replacing $\mathbb{R}^m$ with this linear subspace, we may assume A is surjective. After a change of basis of the codomain and a reordering of the basis of the domain, we may assume $A$ is of the form $[I|B]$ Any help or hints are appreciated, thank you. Ideas: Let $v_i=Ae_i$ , then my original statement is equivalent to saying the set $\{\sum a_iv_i |a_i\geq 0\}$ is a closed set. So I should now prove the following: For any $v_1,...,v_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , the set $S=\{\sum a_iv_i |a_i\geq 0\}$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . I suspect that the set $S$ is an intersection of half spaces, from this the closedness will be obvious. Equivalently, I suspect that for each $x\notin S$ , there exists a half space $H$ (cut by a codimension 1 linear subspace)s.t. $S\subset H$ . Is this statement true? I guess this should be true after drawing some examples. New ideas:
I am proving that the set $\{\sum a_iv_i|a_i\geq 0 \}$ is closed, and this is easy if all the $v_i$ 's are indeed independent, so I would want to prove the following: Let $S=\{$ linearly independent subsets of $\{v_i\}\}$ , then $\{\sum a_iv_i|a_i\geq 0\}=\cup_{T\subset S}\{$ non negative linear combinations of $T\}$ And this union is closed since it is a finite union of closed set. Equivalently, let $x=\sum a_iv_i,a_i\geq 0$ , I want to write $x=\sum b_ie_i$ , where $b_i\geq 0$ and $\{e_i\}\subset \{v_i\}$ is linearly independent. My proof is as follows:
I can replace $\{v_i\}$ with a smaller subset of itself s.t. $x$ cannot be expressed by non negative linear combinations of any strictly smaller subset of it.
Now I claim that this set is linearly independent. Suppose not, then we can write $c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdots + c_nv_n=0$ , with some $c_i$ 's are positive(since we can multiply the whole expression by $-1$ ) and I assume that $c_i>0$ for $i=1,2,\dots ,k$ and $c_i \leq 0$ for $i>k$ Now I assume $b=a_1/c_1=\min _{i=1,2,\dots ,k}{a_i/c_i}$ ,
Then I have $$x=\sum a_iv_i-b(\sum c_iv_i)=                      (a_2-bc_2)v_2     +(a_3-bc_3)+\cdots + (a_n-bc_n)v_n$$ Which is a non negative linear combinations of fewer vectors, contradicts to my assumption and hence the minimal set $\{v_i\}$ is linearly independent.",['general-topology']
2184172,Does there hold that $(\sigma(A))^3=\sigma(A^3)$ in a Banach space?,"Let $X$ be a Banach space over the field $\mathbb C$ of complex numbers, suppose that $A:X\to X$ is a bounded linear operator. Does there hold that $\sigma(A^3)=\{\lambda^3;\lambda\in\sigma(A)\}?$ Here $I:X\to X$ is the identity from $X$ to itself and we use the notation that $$\rho(A)=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C;\lambda I-A\ \hbox{has bounded inverse}\},\sigma(A)=\mathbb C\setminus\rho(A).$$ For the question above, I have some slight trials at this time. For any $\lambda\in\sigma(A),$ let us show that $\lambda^3\in\sigma(A^3).$ Arguing via contradiction and assuming that $\lambda^3\in\rho(A^3),$ that is, $\lambda^3I-A^3:X\to X$ is injective and also surjective. We note that $$\lambda^3 I-A^3=(\lambda I-A)(\lambda^2I+\lambda A+A^2)=(\lambda^2I+\lambda A+A^2)(\lambda I-A),$$ then $\lambda^2I+\lambda A+A^2:X\to X$ is injective and also surjective, and $\lambda I-A$ is injective, but it must not be surjective since $\lambda\in\sigma(A).$ For any operator $T:X\to X,$ we denote by $R(T)$ the range of $T.$ Since $R(\lambda I-A)\subsetneqq X$ and $(\lambda^2 I+\lambda A+A^2)|_{R(\lambda I-A)}:R(\lambda I-A)\to X$ is surjective, we conclude that $\lambda^2 I+\lambda A+A^2:X\to X$ should not be injective, a contradiction. On the other hand, if $\mu\in\sigma(A^3),$ let $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3\in\mathbb C$ be the complex solutions of the equation $z^3=\mu.$ Then we obtain $$\mu I-A^3=\prod_{i=1}^3(\omega_iI-A),$$ and there must be some $i\in\{1,2,3\}$ such that $\omega_i I-A:X\to X$ does not possess bounded inverse, so $\omega_i\in\sigma(A).$ For above proof of my question, is it true?

2184173,Dice probability theory questions,"Given $3$ normal $6$-sided dice, what is the probability the sum will be 9?, What is the probability that the first die shows 5? and What is the conditional probability that the first die shows $5$, given that the sum of the dice is $9$? This was the given solution for question 1: $x_1+x_2+x_3=9$, where each $x_i\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. We can rephrase this as the number of solutions to the problem $x_1+x_2+x_3=6$, where each $x_i\in\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ I'm confused why and how they changed $9$ to $6$. Then solving using combinations with repetition, $\binom{6+4-1}{6} -3 = 25$ because $(6,0,0)$, $(0,6,0)$, $(0,0,6)$ don't meet our constraints subtract $3$. I'm confused where the constraint came, since dice don't have $0$ it can't be the rolls.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Notice that $x^{n-n} = x^0 = 1$ only when $x\neq0$. This is because $0^0$ is indeterminate. It is evident that $x=0$ is clearly not in the domain of $P(x)$.

More precisely, given sets $A, B \subset X$ such that $A,B$ are path-connected and $X=\mathrm{int}(A) \cup \mathrm{int}(B)$ is simply connected, then $A \cap B$ is also path-connected (note the problem with the standard example: the circle is not simply connected). My question therefore is: does the above hold for connectedness?
