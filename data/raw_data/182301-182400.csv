3328482,Minimize $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2\sigma_i^2$ subject to $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=1$,"I am having a little issue with this problem. I know that if we were to only have $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2$$ subject to $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=1$$ then we can use Lagrange multipliers, and we get $a_i=1/n$ for all $i$ . In this case we have that the $\sigma_{i}$ 's are known constants, but they are not necessarily equal to each other, so I cannot really do anything else with those. I know the answer is $$a_i=\frac{(1/\sigma_i^2)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(1/\sigma_i^2)}$$ but I have tried to use this and have not had any luck thus far. Any help given is much appreciated. Thank you.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'statistical-inference', 'statistics']"
3328512,Normal Complement to a Sylow $2$-subgroup in a group of order $4$ mod $8$.,"For a group of order $n$ congruent to $4$ mod $8$ , the Sylow $2$ -subgroup has order $4$ , and hence is either cyclic, or elementary abelian. In the first case (cyclic Sylow) we know that there is a normal complement, and clearly in the other case there may not be. An example of course is the alternating group $A_5$ , or any of the other simple groups of order $4$ mod $8$ . But all of the simple groups of that size $3$ divides the order of the group. Is it possible that if $3$ does not divide the order of the group, then we do get a normal complement? Does anyone have a counter example, or a reference. 
Edit: Thanks for the hints. Burnsides theorem works fine if the sylow 2 group is cyclic, but it needs help if the sylow 2 subgroup is the non-cyclic group of order 4. That is the reason for the hypothesis that 3 does not divide the order of the group. As of now  I do not see how to apply this. 
As pointed out below by DH and JL, the key is that the action of the normalizer N of the sylow subgroup on itself gives a homomorphism to the automorphism group of C_2 x C_2, which is S3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the center of N, so N/Center(N) injects into S3.  But N has no elements of order 3, since G doesn’t.","['finite-groups', 'reference-request', 'normal-subgroups', 'sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"
3328546,Compact subspace of a CW complex: find the mistake in my proof,"Let $A$ be a compact subset of a CW complex $X$ . I want to show that $A$ intersects only finitely many open cells of $X$ . I know you can prove this by taking the set containing one point from the intersection of $A$ with each open cell, and showing that this set is compact and discrete, and thus must be finite. (See for example this question .) I'm curious where I have made a mistake in my attempt at a different proof of the same result: Let $\{e_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in \mathcal{B}}$ be the collection of open cells of $X$ which intersect $A$ non-trivially. Since $X$ is a disjoint union of open cells, it must be that $A \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in \mathcal{B}} e_{\alpha}$ , and thus $\{e_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in \mathcal{B}}$ forms an open cover of $A$ . Since $A$ is compact, there exists a finite subset $\{e_1, \cdots, e_k\} \subset \{e_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in \mathcal{B}}$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^k e_{i}$ . Since for all $\alpha \in \mathcal{B}, e_{\alpha} \cap A \neq \emptyset$ , we must have that $e_{\alpha} \cap \bigcup_{i=1}^k e_{i} \neq \emptyset$ for all $\alpha \in \mathcal{B}$ . As all the open cells in $X$ are disjoint, if the indexing set $\mathcal{B}$ is infinite then there exists $1\leq j\leq k$ such that infinitely many $\alpha \in \mathcal{B}$ satisfy that $e_{\alpha} \cap e_{j} \neq \emptyset$ . Again by disjointness, for infinitely many $\alpha \in \mathcal{B}, e_{\alpha} = e_j$ . This is impossible since all the cells in $\{e_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in \mathcal{B}}$ are distinct. I'm really worried that this does not use the closure-finiteness of CW complexes which is so crucial in the first proof.","['general-topology', 'cw-complexes', 'algebraic-topology']"

3328592,Sum of determinants of block submatrices,"I have a $2n \times 2n$ matrix, $M$ . I view it a block matrix, of $n^2$ blocks, each of shape $2\times 2$ . Computing the determinant of $M$ is easy by conventional methods. I could also look at diagonal block submatrices : given a set $S \subseteq [n]$ , I take the submatrix of all the rows in $S$ and columns in $S$ . For instance, if $n=3$ , I have 9 blocks (each of 4 entries), $A_{1,1}, A_{1,2} \dots  A_{3,3}$ . $S$ could be ${1,3}$ , in which case I take the 4x4 submatrix $$\begin{bmatrix} A_{1,1} & A_{1,3} \\ A_{3,1} & A_{3,3}\end{bmatrix}$$ There are $2^n$ such submatrices, and each has its own determinant. I would like to compute the sum of those determinants as efficiently as possible. (The trivial case, where $S = \emptyset$ , naturally has a determinant of 1.) This might sound like a bold hope, but consider that if this were not a block matrix, then you can very easily compute the sum of the determinants of the diagonal submatrices: $$ \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} M_{S,S} = \det(M + I) $$ So I'm hoping that there's some way to make a good ""block identity matrix"" that I can carry out operations with to compute this sum. Honestly, I'd be happy with anything in polynomial time. Proofs of hardness would also be interesting. For instance, I could believe that the problem of computing the permanent might somehow be reduced this problem, in which case it would be NP-Hard. I have several fairly different approaches that take $2^n$ time, so anything in even $1.9^n$ would be stimulating.","['computational-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'block-matrices']"
3328630,Demystifying the Determinant,"Preface: I’ve read a few of the posts on here about the determinant but none seem to put to rest the the questions I have, so I’ve decided to ask outright. Question: In general, I would like to just have a deeper understanding of where the determinant comes from. It seems so fundamental to almost any field of mathematics. So here are my questions about it: Who discovered the formula for the determinant? Was it noticed or was it built for a specific purpose? If so what was that motivation? Why/how does it relate to consistent/inconsistent systems? How does it relate to cross product? Why is it that two vectors aligned in a certain way produces a third orthogonal vector and how does the determinant make this happen? Why is the determinant used in finding  eigenvalues and eigenvectors? Any details would be very much appreciated!","['determinant', 'linear-algebra']"
3328640,Compute face angles for a snub disphenoid (Johnson solid J84),"What I understand so far: This shape has 12 triangular faces (all equilateral triangles since this is a Johnson solid) and 8 vertices. We have 4 faces meeting at 4 of the vertices and 5 faces meeting at the other 4 vertices. The two vertices where 4 faces meet can be split into 2 groups, each group containing 2 such vertices that are connected between them and not connected to any of the 2 vertices in the other group. This means we can get this shape by taking two regular octahedra, removing 2 adjacent faces from each and then joining them. We could also build it starting from a pentagonal bipyramid as shown here . What can be seen in the above figure is that at each vertex where 5 faces meet, we have 2 groups of 2 faces that are almost in the same plane. What I want to know How can I compute the angles of the faces? I want to get these angles without starting from the vertex coordinates which I can find online because that's just starting from the solution.","['angle', 'geometry', '3d', 'polyhedra']"

3328771,"If all closed subsets of a set are compact, does it follow that this set is subset of a compact set?","It is well known that closed subsets of compact sets are themselves compact. Now the reverse is not true: A set of which all closed subsets are compact needs not to be compact itself; for example, consider non-closed bounded sets in $\mathbb R^n$ . However those sets are themselves subsets of compact sets (as bounded sets, they are subsets of closed balls, which are compact). And it is obvious that the initially quoted theorem also holds for arbitrary subsets of compact sets, since the subset relation is transitive. However I wonder: Can there exist a set in some topological space, no matter how weird, such that all closed subsets of that set are compact, but the set itself is not the subset of a compact set? There was a related question that asked about the case where all proper closed subsets of a topological space are compact, and the conclusion was that the space itself is compact. However if this helps with the subset case, then I don't see how. Clarification: Since it seems to have caused a lot of confusion in the comments: In the context of my post, “closed” is to be understood in the topology of the full space, not in the subspace topology of the subset (those are very different notions of “closed”!)","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

of the negative part (see the orange box in Fig (A)') is faster than
that of the positive part(see green rectangle). At first glance, Figure (C) seems to converge faster than others, but

3328866,Can we approximate elements in $L^2$ via smooth maps while preserving a pointwise constraint on the derivatives?,"Let $\mathbb{D}^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be the closed $n$ -dimensional unit ball. Suppose we are given an open connected* subset $U \subseteq \mathbb{D}^n$ of full measure in $\mathbb{D}^n$ , and a smooth bounded map $f:U \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ , where $k>1$ . Note that $f \in L^2(\mathbb{D}^n, \mathbb{R}^{k})$ . Now, let $h:\mathbb{D}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ be a smooth map satisfying $h(x) \neq 0$ for every $x \in U$ (in particular $h(x) \neq 0$ a.e.). Assume that $ (df_x)^T\big(h(x)\big)=0$ for every $x \in U$ . Do there exist smooth maps $f_k:\mathbb{D}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ which converge to $f$ in $L^2$ and satisfy $ ((df_k)_x)^T\big(h(x)\big)=0$ ? Note that the derivatives of the original $f$ may explode when we approach $\partial U=\mathbb{D}^n \setminus U$ . I also don't assume that $f$ can be continuously extended to all of $\mathbb{D}^n$ or that it is a Sobolev map. Edit: Why $U$ must be connected in general: Take $h(x)=(1,0,...,0)$ to be constant. The condition $(df_x)^T\big(h(x)\big)=0$ is equivalent to $$ \langle\partial_j f(x),h(x)\rangle=\partial_jf^1(x)=0 \,\,\quad \forall j=1,...,n\quad\forall x \in U, $$ i.e. $\nabla f^1=0$ on $U$ . If $U$ is not connected, we can make $f^1$ to obtain two different constant values on different connected components of $U$ . Now, any smooth map $g:\mathbb{D}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ that satisfies $ (dg_x)^T\big(h(x)\big)=0$ on $\mathbb{D}^n$ must have constant first component, hence cannot approximate well our map $f$ . I guess a reasonable start would be to start with $h$ being constant: Suppose that $h(x)=(h^1,h^2,...,h^k)$ . Then our condition becomes $$ \langle\partial_j f(x),h(x)\rangle=\partial_j(\sum_{i=1}^k h^if^i)=0 \,\,\quad \forall j=1,...,n\quad\forall x \in U, $$ i.e. $\nabla (\sum_{i=1}^k h^if^i)=0$ on $U$ . Since $U$ is connected, this implies that $\sum_{i=1}^k h^if^i$ is constant. Now, the question is whether or not $f$ can be approximated by smooth maps $f_k$ with constant $\sum_{i=1}^k h^if_k^i$ .","['measure-theory', 'approximation-theory', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"

It is not hard to see, that $L(\mathfrak{U})$ is closed under subgroups, quotients and direct products, and thus is a variety too. So $L$ is an operator on group varieties. If I am not mistaken, it is usually called Levi operator. It is always true, that $\mathfrak{U} \subset L(\mathfrak{U})$ , however the converse is not true in general: for example, Levi operator maps the variety of abelian groups to the variety of $2$ -Engel groups.

So the convergence of $\int\limits_1^{+\infty}\frac {\cos x}{2x}\cos \frac {1}{x} \mathrm dx$ is conditional. And this one, I don't understand: $$|\frac {\sin \frac{1}{x}}{2x}\sin x| \le \frac {|\sin {\frac{1}{x}}|}{2x} \sim \frac{1}{2x^2}$$ so $\int\limits_1^{+\infty} \frac {\sin \frac{1}{x}}{2x}\sin x \mathrm dx$ absolute converges by the comparative criterion. $\int\limits_1^{+\infty} o \biggl(\frac {1}{x^2}\biggl) \mathrm dx$ also converges by the comparative criterion. 
So, the conclusion is $$\int\limits_1^{+\infty}\biggl(e^{x^2}\cos{\biggl(x+\frac {1}{x}\biggl)}\int\limits_x^{+\infty}e^{-t^2}\mathrm dt\biggl)\mathrm dx.$$ converges conditional.","['integration', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

So the proof starts like this: We define a morphism $$ \mathcal{O}_X(U) \rightarrow K_{X, \eta} = O_{X, \eta}, \ s \mapsto [(U,s)].$$ This map is injective because if $[(U,s)]=0$ then $s(\eta)=0$ in $K_{X, \eta}$ . The set $V=\{x \in U \ | \ s(x) = 0 \in K_{X,x} \}$ is closed in $U$ and contains $\eta$ . Hence the set $V$ must be all of $U$ . Therefore $s=0$ . My explanation why $V$ is closed: $U$ is affine so we may assume that $U = \text{Spec}(A)$ for some ring $A$ . Then $\mathcal{O}_X(U) = {\mathcal{O}_X}|_U (U) = A$ . So the element $s$ corresponds to some $a \in A$ . In $V$ we have: $\mathfrak{p} \in V$ then $s(\mathfrak{p}) = \frac{s}{1} \equiv 0 \in A_{\mathfrak{p}} / {\mathfrak{p} A_{\mathfrak{p}}}$ . Thus $s \in \mathfrak{p}$ . So the set $V$ is just the set of primes that contain $s$ , which is closed. If my explanation is correct, how does it then follow that $s=0$ ? Is it because if $V=U$ then all primes $\mathfrak{p}$ contain $s$ , so $s \in rad(A) = \{0\}$ because $A$ is an integral domain?",['algebraic-geometry']
3329108,Pigeon Hole Principle - Minimum customers needed such that at least one is a winner,"I was reading about pigeon-hole principle from this paper . If n items are put into m pigeonholes with n > m ( m,n ∈ N ∗ ), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one item. One of the applications of the principle is stated as: Pitter is the boss of a lotto games company, the lottery is a number
which contains 5 digits. Every month, the machine picks up 1 number
randomly and the owner of the lottery ticket with the same number will
win one million dollars. In order to demonstrate the justice of the
lottery, there must be at least one winner every month. Based on the
former condition, calculate the minimum number of customers should
this ticket be sold to. which has the solution as: Since every digit of the number varies from 0 to 9, there are 10⁵
numbers in total. As a result of it, according to the Pigeonhole
Principle, the number of customers should be at least 10⁵ + 1 = 100001. So, as far as I understand the question and try to relate it with the basics of the principle: The possible lottery tickets are holes here. Customers are pigeon here. We need to find the minimum pigeons (customers) required such that one hole (ticket) is occupied by more than one pigeon. This evaluates to: $100001$ customer required such that two of them share the same ticket. But I cannot understand the solution as it tries to evaluate minimum number of customer required to make the game ""justified"" or ""such that there is at least one winner"". The machine can pickup any random number (of $5$ digits) and if a lottery number can be assigned only to a single customer, then $10^5$ is least number of customers required such that at least one wins. And in this case, there are no ticket left so $10^5+1$ ( $1$ extra customer) is out of question. If more than one customer is allowed to pick up same tickets, then $10^5+1$ customers can also pickup the same ticket (obviously, very low probability) and there could be no winner. I'm sure I'm missing something here.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'lotteries', 'probability']"

""Natural"" Definition If someone on the street hears the word ""permutation,"" I think they will naturally assume that a permutation: Involves rearranging objects The order in which the objects are written, before and after the permutation is performed, is of crucial importantce (it's really the essence of the permutation) I would naturally expect a permutation to be an instruction, or an action. For example, I would expect a permutation to look something like $$\sigma = \text{interchange the first two entries.}$$ Then, if we apply $\sigma$ to $(A, B, C)$ we get $(B, C, A);$ if we apply it to $(4, 6, 9)$ we get $(6, 4, 9).$ To me this is a very satisfying (informal) definition of a permutation, because it captures exactly what many people (or at least me) would think a permutation ""should be."" Another way to define ""permutation"" (to me, less satisfactory than the previous, but still more satisfactory than the official definition) could be to just say that ""the 3-tuple $(B, A, C)$ is a permutation of $(A, B, C).$ "" (In fact, I think this is the definition used in elementary Statistics books.) Percieved Weaknesses of the Official Definition It makes little sense to ""permute"" your set of objects. If you have a set of objects $\{4, 6, 8 \},$ and while you are not in the room someone applies a permutation to your set, you will never know; the output of your permutation is still $\{4, 6, 8 \}.$ Even if they only apply the permutation to a subset, you only might be able to tell. Permutations seem to have nothing to do with the order that your objects are in, either before or after doing the permutation. This, like I mentioned above, seems to violate the whole point of a permutation I call these weaknesses because they seem to violate the ""person on the street"" understanding of a permutation, and I know that generally mathematicians try really hard to not distort the meaning of common English words too much. My Question Is there really such a big disconnect between the ""Natural"" and Official definitions of permutations?

P_2(x) & x \in A_2\\
\end{cases}$$ where $A=A_1\cup A_2$ and $A_1,A_2$ are pairwise disjoint. What is the ""most intuitive"" average of $P(x)$ , for all $x \in A\cap[a,b]$ , that is unique and where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ ? Note “unique” means a system that produces a single average, instead of multiple averages, using reasoning/intuition. Also note this question is subjective but there are areas of math (such as measure theory) that is  based on intuitions/ intuitive properties. For example, we can pick any arbitrary measure to find the average of Dirichlet's Function in $[0,1]$ , but instead, we use the Lebesgue measure. Why is the Lebesgue measure intuitive? Because if real numbers in $[a,b]$ are written as infinite, randomly generated digits; there is zero probability they will represent a number in $[a,b]$ . Moreover, there is zero probability that finite, randomly generated digits will repeat infinitely to give rational numbers; hence, these digits have a probability $1$ of being irrational.  Say we multiplied these intuitive probabilities times $b-a$ . This gives the results of the Lebesgue measure. Hence we can state the Lebesgue measure is intuitive for these cases? However, if we are focusing on countable $A\cap[a,b]$ , it should still have a measure of one and the average of $P$ should exist between the infimum and supermum of its range. The problem is most countably additive measures of $A\cap[a,b]$ is zero giving $P$ an average outside the range. What measure should we use instead? What do you think are intuitive properties/examples that the average should follow? Here are two examples, I believe our measure and average should match If $A$ has a Lebesgue measure of one the average of $P$ should intuitively be $$\int_{\mu(A_1\cap[a,b])}P_1(x)dx+\int_{\mu(A_2\cap[a,b])}P_2(x)dx$$ Where $\mu$ is a measure that equals the Lebesgue measure (when the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is one). Even better, we could use the Gauge Integral , which is far more general and doesn't use a measure. However, even the Gauge integral gives the average of $P$ zero, when defined on a domain with zero Lebesgue measure. Here are two cases that the average of $P$ , where the Lebesgue measure of $A\cap[a,b]$ is zero, should intuitively follow. If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite in $[a,b]$ , the average of $P$ is $$\frac{\sum\limits_{i\in A\cap[a,b]}P(i)}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}+\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}+\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ And probability measure $\mu(X\cap[a,b])$ for $X\subseteq A$ is $$\mathbf{W_1}=\mu(A_1\cap[a,b])=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W_2}=\mu(A_2\cap[a,b])=\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W}_1\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}+\mathbf{W}_2\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ If $A_1$ is countable infinite in $[a,b]$ and $A_2$ is finite, since $A\cap[a,b]$ is countably infinite, if $\mathbf{J}_m$ contains all finite subsets of $A\cap[a,b]$ where $\max\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}|\mathbf{J}_m|=\left|\mathbf{I}_n\right|\le n$ ; $\mathbf{I}_n$ is arranged as $\left\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\right\}$ where $a\le a_1<a_2<...<a_n\le b$ , and $$ \max_{i\le n,i\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\text{diff} (\mathbf{I_n})\right)=\max_{i\le n,i\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,...,a_n-a_{n-1}\right\}\le K(n)$$ such that $K:S\to\mathbb{R}$ , $\mu(S)=1$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}K(n)=\inf\text{diff}(A)$ ; then the measures $W_1$ and $W_2$ are $$\mathbf{W}_{1}=\mathbf{\mu}(A_1\cap[a,b])=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\left|A_1\cap \mathbf{I}_n\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|\mathbf{I}_{n}\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W}_{2}=\mathbf{\mu}(A_2\cap[a,b])=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\left|A_2\cap \mathbf{I}_n\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|\mathbf{I}_{n}\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ And $\text{avg}(P)$ is $$\mathbf{W}_{1}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i_1\in A_1 \cap I_n \cap [a,b]}P_1(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap I_n\cap[a,b]\right|}+\mathbf{W}_{2}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i_2\in A_2 \cap I_n \cap [a,b]}P_2(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap I_n\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ Any $\mathbf{I}_n$ gives the same answer but I'm not sure how to prove this. Moreover, if $A$ is dense in $[a,b]$ , $$\text{avg}(P)=\frac{1}{b-a}\mathbf{W}_1\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx+\frac{1}{b-a}\mathbf{W}_2\int_{a}^{b}P_2(x) \ dx=\frac{1}{b-a}(1)\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx+\frac{1}{b-a}(0)\int_{a}^{b}P_2(x) \ dx$$ $$\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx$$ Here's the proof. Since $A$ is dense in $[a,b]$ , it can approximate arbitrarily close to any point in $\mathbb{R}$ . Hence it's possible for the limits outside the domain to exist. We extend $P:A\to\mathbb{R}$ to $P:A \cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ where for $c\in \mathbb{R}\setminus A$ $$C=\left\{P^{-1}\left(\lim_{\left\{ x\in A\right\}\to c}P(x)\right) \right\}$$ Since $A_1$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ , $P:A\cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ can be split into $P_1:A_1\cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ and $P_2:A_2\to\mathbb{R}$ . Since $A_2$ is the discontinuties of $P:A\cup C \to \mathbb{R}$ and the Lebesgue measure of $A_2$ is zero, the Lebesgue criteria for reimman integration states the riemman integral for $P_1:A_1\cup C \to \mathbb{R}$ can exist. Hence we apply the mean value theorem of integration on $P_1$ . If $A_1$ and $A_2$ is dense in $[a,b]$ the average is unclear. For one, we could set $\mathbf{I}_n$ to equal subsets of $A_1$ , $A_2$ or $A_1\cup A_2$ . In this case, $\mathbf{W}_1$ or $\mathbf{W}_2$ could equal anything I will post my intuition for this example. If you have a measure that matches these intuitions, post it below.","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'intuition', 'average']"

Define $S_0=0$ and $S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$ for $n\geq 1$ . Find the limiting distribution of $$\frac1n \sum_{k=1}^{n}|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1)$$ This problem is from Shiryaev's Problems in Probability , in the chapter on the Central Limit Theorem. It was asked on this site in 2014, but remains unanswered. I posted it yesterday on Cross Validated , and I think it's worth to cross-post it here as well. Since $S_{k-1}$ and $X_k$ are independent, $E(|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1))=0$ and $$V(|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1)) = E(S_{k-1}^2(X_k^2 - 1)^2)=  E(S_{k-1}^2)E((X_k^2 - 1)^2) =2(k-1)$$ Note that the $|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1)$ are clearly not independent. However, as observed by Clement C. in the comments, they are uncorrelated since for $j>k$ $$\begin{aligned}Cov(|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1), |S_{j-1}|(X_j^2 - 1)) 
&= E(|S_{k-1}|(X_k^2 - 1)|S_{j-1}|)E(X_j^2 - 1)\\
&=0

Note (my first steps) : Considering that membership in $\boldsymbol{S}_{\geq p}$ can be viewed as a simple Bernoulli random variable with probability $1 - p$ , we can get the following bound using Hoeffding's inequality with parameter $\varepsilon > 0$ : $$
\Pr \Big(| \boldsymbol{S}_{\geq p}| \geq (1 - p + \varepsilon)n\Big) \leq \mathrm{e}^{-2 \varepsilon^2 n}
$$ Therefore for any $\delta > 0$ and $n \geq \ln{\frac{1}{\delta}} / 2\varepsilon^2$ ,  we can bound $\pmb{\sum}\boldsymbol{S}_{\geq p}$ with $1-\delta$ confidence: $$\pmb{\sum}\boldsymbol{S}_{\geq p} \leq \pmb{\sum}\{x : x \in \boldsymbol{S} \land x \geq  \text{$\lfloor(p - \varepsilon)n\rfloor$-th element in $\boldsymbol{S}$}\}

The non-triviality of the fibration is encoded in $N$ , and normally we take $N\in \mathcal{L} (SL(2, \mathbb{Z}))$ . Now, noting that the cartan torus of $SU(3)$ is $T^2$ , we would like to extend this fibration to $SU(3)$ , i.e. fibre $SU(3)$ non-trivially over a circle in the same way. The generators of the fibre are $J^i, J^a$ , $a=1,...,6$ , and these obey the usual $SU(3)$ commutation relations. We now have some twist for the $J^a$ as well, $[J^y, J^a]=M^a_bJ^b$ , where $M$ should probably be determined by $N$ , but I haven't completely verified this yet.

Firstly, you prove the Lebesgue differentiation theorem is true for continuous functions. This seems to be true even for non lebesgue measures because we are just using the uniform continuity property. Secondly, we used the fact that continuous functions are dense in L2 to pick a continuous function close to our arbitrary L2 function for which we want to show the general case of the theorem.

Let $\varepsilon$ be the map $n \mapsto k$ , and let $\sigma$ be the map $n \mapsto a$ . Now define two auxiliary functions \begin{align}
	a(n-1) &= \sigma(n) \cdot 3^{ \varepsilon(n) } \text{,} \\
	b(n+1) &= \sigma(n) \cdot 1^{ \varepsilon(n) } \text{,}

	T(n) &= b(a(n)) \text{.}
\end{align} Collatz problem concerns the question of whether the function iterates reach 1, for all $n>0$ .
This is nothing new.
I just formulated the Collatz problem in a very complicated manner.
Instead of tracking $n$ directly, I now track the pair $(\sigma(n), \varepsilon(n))$ . The point of this formulation is that I can verify the convergence of the problem for all $\sigma(\cdot) < \Sigma$ and $\varepsilon(\cdot) < E$ .
This is much easier than verifying the problem directly on $n$ because pairs of values $(\sigma(n), \varepsilon(n))$ take much smaller magnitudes than the $n$ itself.
For example, I have verified the convergence for all $(\sigma, \varepsilon)$ below $(2^{44}, 14)$ .
This was fairly fast on my desktop computer.
For convenience, the pair $(2^{44}, 14)$ corresponds to approximatelly $2^{66.2}$ . Can anyone confirm the mathematical correctness of my verification procedure?

3330127,Non standard solution to $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\Big(f(\frac{x}{2}) + f(\frac{1+x}{2})\Big)$,"Final update: on 11/29/2019: I have worked on this a bit more, and wrote an article summarizing all the main findings. You can read it here . This functional equation appears in the following context. Let $\alpha\in[0,1]$ be an irrational number (called seed ) and consider the sequence $x_n=\{2^n \alpha\}$ . Here the brackets represent the fractional part function. In particular, $\lfloor 2x_n\rfloor$ is the $n$ -th digit of $\alpha$ in base $2$ . The values $x_n$ are distributed in a certain way due to the ergodicity of the underlying process. The density associated with this distribution is the function $f$ , and for the immense majority of seeds $\alpha$ that density is uniform on $[0, 1]$ , that is, $f(x) = 1, x \in [0, 1]$ . Such seeds $\alpha$ producing the uniform density are sometimes called normal numbers; their digit distribution is also uniform. However, the functional equation $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\Big(f(\frac{x}{2}) + f(\frac{1+x}{2})\Big)$ may have plenty of other solutions. Such solutions are called non-standard solutions. Can you find a seed $\alpha$ producing a non-standard solution, with an explicit form for $f$ ? Maybe a step-wise uniform function? The set of seeds producing non-standard solutions is known to have Lebesgue measure zero, but there are infinitely many such seeds. All rational seeds $\alpha$ work, but they produce a discrete distribution. Thus their density is of the discrete type. Here however, I am interested in a continuous function $f$ , even if it has infinitely many points of discontinuity (that is, a function $f$ continuous almost everywhere: the set of discontinuity points has Lebesgue measure zero.) Update I am looking for a function $f$ that is a density on $[0, 1]$ , so there are additional constraints here: $\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx = 1$ and $f(x) \geq 0$ . However, note that if $f$ is a solution, then $cf$ is also a solution regardless of the constant $c$ . So any solution can be normalized to integrate to one. Also, $cf+d$ is also a solution ( $c, d$ constants). Second update Below is a density satisfying all the requirements. Actually, the plot below represents its percentile distribution. It was produced with a seed $\alpha$ built as follows: its $n$ -th binary digit is $1$ if $\mbox{Rand}(n) < 0.75$ , and $0$ otherwise, using a pseudo random number generator. Note that $P._{25} = 0.5$ and corresponds to a dip ( $P._{25}$ denotes the $25$ -th percentile.) Dips are everywhere, only the big ones are visible. By contrast, the percentile distribution for the uniform case (if you replace $0.75$ by $0.50$ in $\mbox{Rand}(n) < 0.75$ ) is a straight line, with no dips.

Then the weak topology and the norm topology induce the same Borel sigma-algebra on $H$ . I suspect there is something wrong with the following argument, but I'm not sure what it is: Since the weak topology is weaker than the norm topology and $H$ is separable it suffices to show the Borel sigma algebra induced by the weak topology contains all closed balls. We have an isometric isomorphism from $H$ to its dual space given by $x \to \left<x, \cdot\right>$ , from which we see that the weak and weak star topologies coincide. Then by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem any closed ball $B = \{x\in H : \Vert x - y \Vert \leq r\}$ is compact in the weak topology, which implies $B$ is closed in the weak topology since it's Hausdorff.","['hilbert-spaces', 'borel-sets', 'proof-verification', 'functional-analysis']"

3330276,Formal definition of a Pseudotensor,"In physics, a tensor is defined as a multidimensional array with a special transformation law. Therefore, a tensor of type $(r, s)$ is an geometric object $T_{i_{1}\dots i_{s}}^{j_{1}\dots j_{r}}[\,\underline{e}\,]$ to each basis $\underline{e} = (e_1, ..., e_n)$ of an n-dimensional vector space such that the multidimensional array obeys the transformation law $T_{i^{\prime}_{1}\dots i^{\prime}_{s}}^{j^{\prime}_{1}\dots j^{\prime}_{r}}[M\cdot \underline{e}\,]=(M^{-1})_{j_{1}}^{j^{\prime}_{1}}\cdot\dots\cdot (M^{-1})_{j_{r}}^{j^{\prime}_{r}}\cdot T_{i_{1}\dots i_{s}}^{j_{1}\dots j_{r}}\cdot M_{i_{1}^{\prime}}^{i_{1}}\cdot\dots\cdot M_{i_{s}^{\prime}}^{i_{s}}$ where $M$ is the transformation matrix. In calculus this objects can be defined more abstract: There a tensor of type (r,s) is an element of the abstract tensor product $T\in \underbrace{V\otimes \dots \otimes V}_{r-\text{times}}\otimes \underbrace{V^{\ast}\otimes\dots\otimes V^{\ast}}_{s-\text{times}}$ or, because of can. isomorphy, a tensor can be viewed as a  multilinear function $T:\underbrace{V^{\ast}\times\dots\times V^{\ast}}_{r-\text{times}}\times \underbrace{V\times \dots \times V}_{s-\text{times}}\to \mathbb{R}$ .

3330297,From binomial theorem to differential calculus,"I first posted this over at HSM, without much uptake. I'm trying to understand the development of the calculus. Does this sound plausible as one of the stages? Newton knows the binomial theorem, which gives $$(x+y)^n={n\choose0}x^ny^0+...\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(1)$$ Letting $y=δ_x$ (I realise this is Leizbniz's notation but I find it easier to follow than Newton's $o$ ), we get $$(x+δ_x)^n={n\choose0}x^nδ_x^0+...\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2)$$ Considering $δ_x$ as the base of a differential triangle under a curve, the vertical of the triangle is given by $(x+δ_x)^n-x^n$ , which gives us $$(x+δ_x)^n-x^n={n\choose0}x^nδ_x^0+...-x^n\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3)$$ But ${n\choose0}x^nδ_x^0=x^n$ , so the first part of the expansion disappears and everything else moves up one place to the left and we get $$(x+δ_x)^n-x^n={n\choose1}x^{n-1}δ_x^1+...\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(4)$$ Now, the vertical $(x+δ_x)^n-x^n$ can be called $δ_y$ , so now we can write $$\frac{δ_y}{δ_x}=\frac{(x+δ_x)^n-x^n}{δ_x}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\\ = \frac{1}{δ_x}{n\choose1}x^{n-1}δ_x^1+...\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(5)$$ As $δ_x$ gets small, the gradient approaches instantaneity, which is good, but $\frac{1}{δ_x}$ gets large, which seems problematic. Fortunately, it cancels with the $δ_x$ terms in the expansion to give $$\frac{δ_y}{δ_x}={n\choose1}x^{n-1}+{n\choose2}x^{n-2}δ_x^1+...\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(6)$$ And now we can use the biniomial theorem to make a differential triangle under any polynomial.

3330306,"Smallest number not expressible using first $n$ powers of $2$ (exactly once each), with $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$, and parentheses?","Motivation Solution to this problem is a lower bound for a more general problem . Problem Given first $n$ powers of two: $1,2,4,8,16,\dots,2^{n-1}$ that all need to be used exactly once per number expressed, what is the smallest positive integer $f(n)$ that can't be made, if we can use the four basic arithmetic operations $(+,-,\times,\div)$ , and parentheses? The $f(1)=2$ is trivial, as well as $f(2)=4$ , for example given $\{1,2\}$ : $$\begin{array}{}
1 &= 2-1 \\
2 &= 2\times 1 \\
3 &= 2+1
\end{array}$$ But we can't make four which is trivial to conclude, so $f(2)=4$ . Progress It is clearly true $f(n+1)\ge f(n)$ since we can reduce the $n+1$ case to $n$ case by subtracting last two powers. This means that we can rebuild all the numbers from previous case at least. Even more so, we can inductively show that: $f(n)\ge2^n$ , for all $n\ge1$ by constructing first $2^n-1$ numbers. But I'm not sure how to extend the construction for more numbers to reach the full $f(n)$ . The solutions so far, along with pattern for $f(n)$ : $$\begin{array}{}
n & f(n) & f(n+1)\ge f(n)\ge 2^n \\
1 & 2 & 2^1 \\
2 & 4 & 2^2 + 0 \\

9 & ? & 2^9 + 0 + 3 + 8 + 34 + 488 + 1812 + 7042 + ??
\end{array}$$ Here is the brute force output for $n=4,5,6$ . Relevant: $A071314$ - Note that there we are allowed to not use all powers per expression, unlike here. Also note that there for some reason $a(6)=595$ , meaning they don't allow to build $595$ (see end of this post how we can actually make it). I think there ""intermediate fractions"" are not allowed, or the sequence terms are incorrect. Since $f(n+1)\ge f(n)$ , notice $f(n+1)=f(n)+g(n)$ , $g(n)=0,3,8,34,488,1812,7042,\dots$ Is it possible to find $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ for all $n$ ? Can we find $g(n)$ or compute it efficiently? Are there similar problems with results that can provide insight into this problem? To clarify the base construction We can prove first $2^n-1$ numbers can always be constructed inductively. Assume this is true: The $2^n-1$ is simply the sum of the powers. The last step is obtainable. The $2^{n-1}$ is the last term, and previous case $(n-1)$ can by assumption build all numbers from $1$ to $2^{n-1}-1$ . Summing these terms gives us all numbers from $2^{n-1}$ to $2^n-1$ . Repeat this for $(n-2)$ and so on until you reach the base case $1$ . From $n,\dots,1$ we reached the base case $\{1\}$ which trivially builds $1$ . We can build all numbers from $1$ to $2^n-1$ which was shown inductively. This means $f(n)\ge 2^n$ for $n\ge 1$ . Notice we haven't used division yet. Extending the construction We ca now try to extend the construction: Let $d=2^{n-1}$ largest power. For $n\ge3$ , we can show we can obtain the $3$ extra terms: $d\cdot 2 \cdot 1,\space  d\cdot 2 + 1,\space  (d + 1)\cdot 2$ So we have: $f(n)\ge 2^n+3,n\ge 3$ , and for this case $f(3)=11$ . For $n\ge4$ , we can show we can obtain the $8$ extra terms: $d\cdot 2 +  (4-1),\space d\cdot 2 +  (4\cdot1),\space  d\cdot 2 +  (4+1),\space   (d +1)\cdot 2 +  4$ , $\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 -1,\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 \cdot1,\space  (d +4)\cdot 2 +1,\space  (d +4+1)\cdot 2$ , So we have: $f(n)\ge 2^n+11,n\ge 4$ , and for this case $f(4)=27$ . And so on, for $f(5),f(6),\dots$ we can construct $34,488,\dots$ extra terms. But I do not see a pattern for generally extending $n$ to $n+1$ . Use of division $(\div)$ Also note that these first five values of $f(n)$ can be obtained without the use of division. And the $f(6)$ would be $595$ if division is not allowed, but with division allowed it is $597$ , so after $n\ge 6$ , the division is significant. That is, $595$ has only one representation possible (ignoring permutations of it): $$
595 = (1 + 16 + 4/8 )\times(2 + 32) 
$$ Numbers usually tend to have multiple representations. This is also the one of the only numbers, that require ""intermediate fractions"", like $4/8$ , to be made. The only other such number so far, is $2471$ . All but these two numbers can be made without ""intermediate fractions"", up to and including all $n\le 8$ cases.","['number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

3330329,"Revisiting the statement ""law of stochastic process is specified by its finite-dim. distributions""","The statement in the title of my post is a basic ""fact"" from probability theory and for quite a long time I thought I had fully understood its meaning. However, today I stumbled across an issue which made me rethink. First of all, let me state a brief survey of what is commonly known (hopefully this is helpful for some of the readers of this post): Suppose we are given two stochastic processes $X = (X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ and $Y = (Y_t)_{t \geq 0}$ on a common probability space ( $\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ , mapping to $\mathbb{R}$ (of course the state space may also be some arbitrary topological space $S$ equipped with a $\sigma$ -algebra, but let's keep things simple). 1) Assume we do not know any regularity of the paths of $X$ and $Y$ , hence when considering $X$ and $Y$ as path-valued random variables, we have no (reasonable) choice but to consider $\mathbb{R}^{[0,\infty]}$ as their state space (or, in general, $S^{[0,\infty]}$ if we consider arbitrary state spaces $S$ ). In most situations one will equip this path space with the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by all canonical projections, i.e. with $\sigma(\pi_t|t \geq 0)$ and then it is well-known that the laws of $X$ and $Y$ coincide if and only if they have the same finite-dimensional distributions. This follows easily by the structure of the mentioned $\sigma$ -algebra (essentially, this is also how the uniqueness-part of the Kolmogorov existence theorem can be dealt with). Everything is fine here. 2) Assume we have quite a lot of regularity of the paths of $X$ and $Y$ , i.e. the paths belong to $C(\mathbb{R}_+,\mathbb{R})$ . As in 1), this space will usually be equipped with the $\sigma$ -algebra $\sigma(\pi_t|t \geq 0)$ (one reason is that this $\sigma$ -algebra naturally appears as the Borel- $\sigma$ -algebra of natural topologies on this space, such as the topology of local uniform convergence). Hence the equivalence of equality in law and equality in the fdd's stated in 1) remains true. Things are still good. 3) Now assume the paths of $X$ and $Y$ are known to be cadlag, i.e. they belong to the Skorokhod space - which offers quite a few reasonable topologies and - hence - Borel- $\sigma$ -algebras. The most common one, often called $J_1$ -topology (allowing to wiggle space and time a bit) behaves well in the sense that its Borel- $\sigma$ -algebra is also the one generated by all projections as in 1) and 2). BUT: If we choose the norm of local uniform convergence, then the Borel- $\sigma$ -algebra is a different one. In fact it does not seem to be generated by cylinder sets and this leads me to the impression that in this situation we cannot conclude ""the fdd's uniquely determine the law of the stochastic process"", because the $\sigma$ -algebra of the path space is, in this case, not such that the sets involved in the fdd's generate it. Can somebody clarify this? Can it really happen that (for a quite reasonable topology and Borel $\sigma$ -algebra) the fdd's are not enough to specify the law on the path space? Or would one typically still consider the $\sigma$ -algebra $\sigma(\pi_t | t \geq 0)$ in such situations, even if this might not be the Borel- $\sigma$ -algebra for the underlying topology? I hope to get interesting and helpful comments and answers and would be happy if this long post was valuable as a brainteaser or a review for some of the readers :-)","['measure-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'stochastic-processes', 'skorohod-space', 'probability-theory']"

the smallest $n$ such that $$px^2+q=\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k x+b_k)^2$$ where $\{a_k\},\{b_k\}$ are rational? One can prove a simple upper bound: If the integers $p,q$ may be respectively decomposed in rational squares as $$p=\sum_{k=1}^{n_p} a_k^2,\qquad q=\sum_{k=1}^{n_q} b_k^2,$$ then one has the trivial decomposition $$px^2+q = \sum_{k=1}^{n_p} (a_k x)^2 +\sum_{k=1}^{n_q} (b)_k^2.$$ Hence if $p,q$ respectively can be written as sums of $n_p,n_q$ rational squares then $px^2+q$ can be written as a sum of $n=n_p+n_q$ squares of linear functions with rational coefficents. The case of $(p,q)=(1,7)$ recently appeared on this site as Find the minimum $n$ such that $x^2+7=\sum_{k=1}^n f_k(x)^2$ where $f_k(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ . Since $7=1^2+1^2+1^2+2^2$ and $1=1^2$ , the argument above establishes that the minimum $n$ is at most $n_p+n_q=4+1=5$ . The nontrivial part is to rule out any smaller examples, with Mindlack's answer proving that $n>4$ in that example. However, his answer makes critical use of the fact that $7$ cannot be written as a sum of three rational squares. It is therefore interesting whether $n=n_p+n_q$ is generically the smallest such $n$ or if can be improved further for certain choices of $p,q$ .","['number-theory', 'polynomials', 'elementary-number-theory', 'quadratic-forms']"
