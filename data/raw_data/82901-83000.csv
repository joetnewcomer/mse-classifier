1082115,Limit of function at infinity: $ \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a^n-b^n}{a^n+b^n} $,"I'm learning the basics of Calculus. I got stuck in a very (seemingly) simple problem of evaluating a limit. The problem given is:
$$
\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{3^n-2^n}{3^n+2^n}
$$ The answer given is $1$ (I have no idea how, or why). I think $\lim_{x \to a}\frac{x^m-a^m}{x^n-a^n}=\frac{m}{n}a^{m-n}$, isn't going to help me in any way because in this formula, $x \to a$, not $\infty$ $x$ is not the exponent. Sadly, there's no other formula in my book that seems close to the problem. So could anyone please show me how to solve such problems?

Also, I'm not allowed to use the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem.

In a previous exercise I have interpreted the angle of $\frac{z_1-z_2}{z_1-z_3}$ as the (oriented) angle between the vectors $z_1-z_3$ and $z_1-z_2$, so I imagine that I should use some kind of geometrical argument, but I can't find anything useful (probably my geometry knowledge is deficient).

This set is closed in $X\times [0,1]$. Define $h: A\to X$ by $h|_{X\times \{0\}} = id_X$, $h|_{X\times \{1\}} = x_0$, $h|_{\{x_0\}\times [0,1]} = x_0$. This function is continuous, we can extend it (since being an AR is equivalent to being an AE) to the whole space $X\times [0,1]$. And this will be the required homotopy that squeezes $X$ into a point ($x_0$). But similar approach seems not to work in case of an ANR. Because here I get a neighborhood $V$ of $A$ in $X\times [0,1]$ and an extension of $h$ onto this neighborhood. I can of course find an open $U\subset X$ such that $x_0\times [0,1] \subset U\times [0,1]\subset V$ (where $x_0$ is the point for which I want to find a contractible neighborhood) and consider the restriction of my extension onto $U\times [0,1]$, but the problem is that this map is not necessarily a map from $U\times [0,1]$ to $U$ (the range of my restricted extension can be larger than $U$).

1082811,Computing Hodge numbers of a complete intersection,"The situation is this: I have a 5-dimensional irreducible projective variety $Y$ embedded in $\mathbb P^{13}$.

1082813,What is a mathematically rigorous justification for multiplying edge probabilities of a tree diagram,"I was trying to understand why it was mathematically justified to multiply edge probabilities in a tree diagra and I came across the following question: Why do we multiply in tree diagrams? The second answer is nearly exactly what I needed, however, there are some things that I still don't understand about it. Or maybe there are just some things about the answer that are not mathematically rigorous enough for me (or trivial enough for the poster that the details were omitted), specially in the context of view probability with set theory . That is what I wish to address: how to treat probability tree diagrams with set theory rigorously and thus calculate probabilities on trees in a mathematically justified way. The main issue that I have is how leaves/outcomes are specified with set notation in a sloppy way, which leads has lead to weird justification of calculating probabilities in tree diagrams. I will try to address what I think the issue are in detail in the frame of set theory to make sure that everything is precisely and clearly defined. The exact issue that I am having is with the notation $\cup$ and $\cap$ being used to describe probabilistic statements. In high school we are taught to think about these as AND and ORs. I wish to abandon that mentality (since I think its one of the reasons for my confusion) and be extremely precise on the use of $\cap$ and $\cup$. Intersection and Union are two operations that only apply to sets . I will use them in that way and wish to address their correct use in probability theory. First lets try to define ""outcome"" and ""events"" precisely and see how they relate to tree diagrams. An outcome normally means a specific way of specifying the result of an experiment. For example, in the monty hall problem we can specify the outcome of the experiment by the following triplet: outcome = (car location, player's initial guess, door revealed by the host). i.e. an outcome is fully specified when we specify the location where the car actually is, what the players initial guess is and the door that was revealed by the host. Hence resulting in the following tree diagram: ( which I got from MIT's course for mathematics for computer science 6.042 ).
as it can be appreciated, the leaves of the tree are the outcomes and all the leaves are the whole samples space $S$. In these terms the samples space is the set of triples: Now, an event is a subset of this samples space, i.e. choosing a subset of the leaves. The issue that I have is that I have seen the leaves of such a tree trees diagram denoted as $(A \cap A \cap B)$ (for the first one on my example) instead of $(A, A, B)$. For me, these two are not the same. The second triplet is just a sequence that acts as an ""index"" to specify a specific outcome in the sample space (which is an element of the set $S$). The notation with intersection (i.e. $A \cap A \cap B$) tries to specify a leaf but it seems plain wrong to me and confusing (or horrible abuse of notation? not sure...). Let me justify why I think its an incorrect way to specify a leaf: firstly, it is not clear to me what $(A \cap A \cap B)$ even means. For me, that just means the empty set, because intersection should only be applied to sets and $(A \cap A \cap B)$ has no intersection. secondly, even if you try to ""repair"" the first issue by insisting that the first position, second and third position are simply events and taking intersections of them is valid, still brings problems. i.e. $(A \cap A \cap B)$ are intersection of ""events"" is still wrong I believe. That solution only bring further problems/question. First, if A is now an event, then, what exactly is it a subset of? (since thats what an event is. If you are trying to use set notation to denote stuff, you better specify what the sets/subsets are). How do we re-define the sample space so that this notation indication of a leaf is justified? If we could do this, then (maybe) the justification explained in the question I posted might be valid (with further justifications). If you try to use set notation to specify a leaf, it seems to me that the correct way to do it is by unions, not intersections. The reason is because, that would actually lead to the correct meaning of what a triplet specifies (and avoid having the issue of the empty set that I specified in my first point). However, since the order of the elements of a sets ""don't matter"" and because the triplets are sequences (where the order maters), the way to fix the new problem I have introduced by using unions is by using a subscript on the position of the triplet (kind of defining a bijection) i.e. the outcome $(A, A, B)$ corresponds $\{ A_1 \cup A_2 \cup B_3\}$. Anyway, taking this definition doesn't help that much, because its not clear to me how to use the general chain rule of probability to justify the probability of a leaf. Basically, how do you rigorously justify using the chain rule of probability to calculate the probability of a single outcome in a probability tree diagram?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

1082846,Can two shapes occupy the exact same area on a plane?,"Suppose there are two triangles on a plane. The coordinates for each point of both triangles are the same. It seems to me that there is nothing to differentiate these two triangles, and as such, they must be identical. Therefore, there can't be more than one such triangle on the plane. I might describe two congruent triangles positioned such that either can rotate to overlap the other one perfectly. In that case, it seems that I could say that the two triangles are identical after the rotation. I'm in first year, so I can only speculate about how set theory represents geometry, but I have a hunch that something would disappear from a set after the rotation, which would decrease the cardinality of the set. However, if there were only one triangle, I suspect that you could rotate it all you want without affecting the cardinality of a set. It would seem very weird if rotation could end the existence of a triangle in some circumstances, but not in others. Then again, perhaps that's just a consequence of the rules. Nevertheless, I can imagine an instructor asking a student to 'rotate the triangle so that it exactly overlaps the other one, record the angle of rotation, dilate it by a factor of x , and then sketch the result. In this case, the instructor seems to talk about the plane as though it includes two identical triangles, even after the rotation; it also seems that the correct sketch would include two triangles, one inside the other. Can a plane include two indiscernible triangles?","['geometry', 'terminology']"

I would greatly appreciate if you could help me to get an answer to the following. Question. Supposing, in addition, that $\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus \overline{G}$ is simply connected and contains
the point $\infty$, how can be used the Riemann mapping theorem in order to constructed the unique conformal bijection mapping $\Phi:\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus \overline{G}\to \overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus \overline{\mathbb{D}}$ which satisfies $\Phi(\infty)=\infty$ and $\Phi^{\prime}(\infty)>0$  ? The existence of the above function $\Phi$  appears stated in many books on complex analysis but without to give any explanation to its construction (only mentioned that it  follows from the Riemann mapping theorem). I might presume that the answer is simple, but unfortunately I cannot figure out it.
Thus, I could take $\Phi(z)=1/f(z)$, where $f:\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus \overline{G}\to\mathbb{D}$ is the mapping from the Riemann's theorem (since $\overline{\mathbb{C}}\setminus \overline{G}$ is open and simply connected).

The devil wins if after countable number of turns — his box contains infinite amount of naturals and — if the devil has a natural, the angel has it (in his box) too.

If it is impossible — just add the least one. 
 If $k=2$ the winner is the devil, the key is to throw out the least of all numbers angel does not have — because of $k=2$ it is infinite number of naturals to stay.

The devil wins if after all turns are done the set $D$ of naturals in his box is infinite and either $D \cap A$ or $D \setminus A$ is finite, where $A$ is the set of naturals in the angel's box.

1083341,$G^k$ is $k$-connected - different approach for proof,"Question :
For a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a positive integer $k$ , let $G^k$ be the graph with vertex set $V$ , where two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if their distance in $G$ is at
most $k$ . Prove: if $G$ is a connected graph on $n$ vertices and $1 \leq k \leq n − 1$ is an integer, then $G^k$ is $k$ -connected. My Answer: (I would love some feedback , is this solution correct? I'm not sure)
The diameter of a graph $d$ is defined as the maximal distance between two vertices. In a complete graph $K_n$ or a $k$ -connected graph of $k<n$ , the question is trivial (or trivial for steps $1...k$ of raising in power), so let's assume that $G$ is $1$ -connected.
Note: $G^1=G.$ We notice that $\forall 1\le k \le n-1$ and $\forall v \in V(G) : 1\le \deg_{G^1}(v) \le \deg_{G^2}(v) \le \ldots \le \deg_{G^d}(v)=\deg_{G^n}(v)=n-1$ This is true because $G$ is connected and for every raise in the Power of $G$ we're only adding more edges, thus possibly increasing the degree of each vertex by at least $1$ , after reaching the power that equals the diameter, no more edges would be added in raising powers because the maximum length has been covered - thus it is $n$ -connected.  This implies that $\forall 1\le k \le n-1: k\le \delta(G^k)  $ . But $k = \delta(G^k)$ must hold , because if $k$ were smaller then it would contradict the previous inequality in that there were possible for example a vertex with degree $1$ in $G^2$ (this is not possible in a graph $G$ with diameter $>2$ , by definition of $G^2$ ). But we saw in class that $\kappa(G) < \delta(G)$ therefore by defintion of $\kappa$ and $k$ -connectivity $G$ is $k$ -connected.","['connectedness', 'graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

$$f_i(-x) \not= -f_i(x) \; \; \; \forall x (\not= 0) \in C[a,b].$$ 
Am I right? But what about boundedness of $f_2$? I know that $f_1$ is bounded and that $\Vert f_1 \Vert = 1$. Let $t_0 \in [a,b]$. Then we have 
$$ x(t_0) \leq \vert x(t_0) \vert \leq \max_{t\in[a,b]} \vert x(t) \vert = \Vert x \Vert.$$
So 
$$\max_{t\in[a,b]} x(t) \leq \Vert x \Vert.$$ 
Also, 
$$-\max_t x(t) = \min_t \left(-x(t)\right) \leq -x(t_0) \leq \vert x(t_0) \vert \leq \max_t \vert x(t) \vert = \Vert x \Vert.$$ 
So 
$$\vert f_1(x) \vert = \vert \max_{t\in[a,b]} x(t) \vert \leq \Vert x \Vert \; \; \; \forall x \in C[a,b].$$ 
Thus it follows that $f_1$ is bounded with $\Vert f_1 \Vert \leq 1$. For $x_0 \in C[a,b]$ defined as $x_0(t) \colon= 1$ for all $t \in [a,b]$, we see that $\vert f_1(x) \vert = \Vert x \Vert = 1$ so that $\Vert f_1 \Vert = 1$. Now comes the turn of $f_2$: 
$$\min_{t\in[a,b]} x(t) \leq x(t_0) \leq \vert x(t_0) \vert \leq \max_{t\in[a,b]} \vert x(t) \vert = \Vert x \Vert $$ 
for all $x \in C[a,b]$. But 
$$ -\min_{t\in [a,b]} x(t) = \max_{t\in[a,b]} \left( - x(t) \right) ... $$ How to proceed from this point? That is, how to show that, for all $x \in C[a,b]$, whether or not the inequality

1083510,What to conclude from $ x \in (A \setminus B \cap B \setminus C)$,I have been working on one of the proof of logical statement and one part of it is like this: $ x \in (A \triangle B) \cap (B \triangle C)$ $ x \in (A \setminus  B\cup B \setminus A) \cap (B \setminus C \cup C \setminus B)$ $x \in (A \setminus B \cap (B \setminus C \cup C \setminus B)) \cup (B \setminus A \cap (B \setminus C \cup C \setminus B)$ $x \in ((A \setminus B \cap B \setminus C) \cup (A \setminus B \cap C \setminus  B)) \cup ((B \setminus A \cap B \setminus C) \cup (B \setminus A \cap C \setminus B))$ Now let us consider one of the disjunct: $ x \in (A \setminus B \cap B \setminus C)$ Now from the above it follows that $x \in B$ and $x \notin B$. So I get a contradictory result from it. How does it affect the whole logical expression ? Does that mean that I can ignore it in the $x \in ((A \setminus B \cap B \setminus C) \cup (A \setminus B \cap C \setminus  B))$ and only consider $x \in (A \setminus B \cap C \setminus  B))$ in my proof ?,"['logic', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
1083528,Harmonic Analysis on the real special linear group,"I would like to understand the representation theory and generalized Fourier transform of $SL(3, \mathbb{R})$ in as concrete a manner as possible. My ultimate goal is to develop an algorithm that can perform the Fourier transform of a discretely sampled function on this group (or a homogeneous space on which it acts), so I will need concrete formulas for the Haar measure and the matrix elements of irreducible representations. Background By ""generalized Fourier transform"" I mean the expansion of a suitably regular function $f : G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ in terms of matrix elements of irreducible representations. Let $U^\lambda$ denote a unitary irreducible representation of $G$ on a Hilbert space, then the Fourier transform is defined as:
$$
\hat{f}(\lambda) = \int_G f(g) U^\lambda(g^{-1}) d\mu(g)
$$ Where $\mu$ is the bi-invariant Haar measure on $SL(3, \mathbb{R})$, which exists because this group is semisimple and hence unimodular. To make this work, we need to know what all the IURs $U^\lambda$ are, and which ones we need in order to decompose our function $f$.
The irreducible unitary representations of semisimple groups have been classified, and it turns out that the spectrum (indexed by $\lambda$) contains both a discerete and a continuous part. However, it is my understanding that not all of the IURs appear in the decomposition of a function space such as $L^2(G)$. Knapp & Trapa write that: Roughly (but not exactly) the members of the unitary dual [the set of equivalence classes of IURs] that appear in $L^2(G)$ can be obtained by a process called ""induction"" that starts from discrete series of certain reductive subgroups of G. Hence not all IURs are needed to decompose $L^2(G)$. Questions What is the explicit form of the Haar measure on $SL(3, \mathbb{R})$ (in terms of some convenient parameterization)? Which IURs do I need in order to decompose a function in $L^2(G)$? I'm not set on this particular function space, so if another one is easier feel free to modify the question. Are there any explicit formulas known for the matrix elements of the relevant IURs? What about the basis functions of irreducible representation spaces in $L^2(G)$? Is anything known about the asymptotics of these functions? This is important because the IURs of $SL(3, \mathbb{R})$ are infinite-dimensional matrices, so an algorithm will have to choose some cutoff. If functions $U^\lambda_{mn}$ do not decay sufficiently fast (or at all) with $m,n$, that may be a showstopper. Although I'm ultimately interested in concrete formulas, partial answers including references or somewhat abstract claims about the representation theory and harmonic analysis on this group are still very much appreciated.

1083531,Shortest distance between a point and a plane using orthogonal projection,"Given a point $v = (x_1,y_1,z_1) \in \mathbb R^3$, and a plane P:=
  $ax+by+cz=d$, find the shortest distance between $v$ and $P$. My attempt at a solution Consider $U = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3| ax+by+cz=0\}$. This is clearly a subspace of $\mathbb R^3$. The strategy which I tried is as follows:- First find a basis for $U$. Since $U$ is finite-dimensional, one can use the Gram-Schmidt procedure to construct an orthonormal basis of $U$. Using this, find $P_U(v)$, which is the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto $U$. Now, since I have $v$ and $P_U(v)$, I can find the unique line $L$ which passes through these two points. Now find the point of intersection $w$ between $L$ and $P$. Calculate the distance $D$ between $v$ and $w$, and this is the shortest distance between $v$ and $P$. Where I'm stuck Using the above method, I got to the point (after tiresome algebraic manipulations) of obtaining $P_U(v)$. But it seems far too cumbersome to obtain $L$ and proceed further. Is there a simpler approach to this problem? I'm only allowed to use the concept of orthogonal projections. Furthermore, this strategy is easy to make sense of geometrically. But how do I prove that $D$ is indeed the shortest distance between $v$ and $w$?","['geometry', 'linear-algebra']"
1083533,subsequence converges to L implies L is a limit point of sequence,"Proposition: Let $(a_n)^\infty_0$ be a sequence of real numbers, and let $L$ be a real number. Then the following two statements are logically equivalent: (a) $L$ is a limit point of $(a_n)^\infty_0$ (b) There exists a subsequence of $(a_n)^\infty_0$ which converges to $L$. I am trying to show that (b) implies (a). I am confused how to relate the different epsilons and Ns together to serve the proof: Proof :
Let $(b_n)^\infty_0$ be a subsequence that converges to $L$: $\forall \epsilon> 0$ there exists an $N$ such that $$|b_n − L|\leq\epsilon,\forall n\geq N$$ For $L$ to be a limit point of the sequence $(a_n)^\infty_0$, we need:
$$\forall \epsilon >0, \forall N\geq0, \exists n\geq N,\text{ such that }|a_n − L| ≤\epsilon$$ I am confused how to continue. Should I fix an epsilon and relate the Ns?","['proof-writing', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
