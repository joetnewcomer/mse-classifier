2794210,Why is the inner measure problematic?,"Currently the Lebesgue measure is defined by the outer measure $\lambda^*(A)$ by the criterion of Carathéodory: A set $A$ is Lebesgue measurable iff for every set $B$ we have $\lambda^*(B)=\lambda^*(B\cap A) + \lambda^*(B\cap A^C)$. However, before the criterion of Carathéodory the Lebesgue measure was defined by the outer and the inner measure $\lambda_*(A)$. For Lebesgue a set has a measure $\lambda(A)$ iff the inner and the outer measure is the same: $\lambda_*(A)=\lambda^*(A)$. Thus, we dropped the inner measure in the current definition of the Lebesgue measure. Why is the inner measure currently not used in the definition of the measure? What are the problems which occur by using the inner measure? My attempts so far: I read that the criterion of Carathéodory makes the extension theorem easier. Why is this the case. Is this the only reason?","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'motivation', 'outer-measure', 'definition']"
2794240,Perimeter-minimizing disks on curved surfaces: is there an asymptotic formula in the limit of small disks?,"Suppose that I have a smooth curved surface, and I choose an arbitrary point $Q$ on that surface. Say the Gaussian curvature at that point is $K$. What I am wondering is, is there an asymptotic formula for the minimal perimeter $P_{min}$ of a disk of area $A$ which contains point $Q$, in the limit of a very small disk with $AK \ll 1$? What I imagine is something like $$
P_{min} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}+\text{powers of $K$ or derivatives of $K$ at $Q$}
$$ The zeroth-order term comes from the planar case. My question is: Is such an expansion possible at all, and if it is, are any lowest order terms known? I have searched but I could not find any result of the sort. For geodesic disks, I have used the Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem to obtain $$
P_{geo} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \left( 1 - \frac{AK}{8\pi} \right) + O(\sqrt{A}A^2K^2)
$$
or equivalently
$$
P_{geo}^2 = 4 \pi A - A^2 K + O(A^3K^2)
$$
which implies that a small geodesic disk of a given area will have larger perimeter in a negatively curved region than in a positively curved region. A second, weaker question is therefore Does a similar result hold for the small perimeter-minimizing disk? I.e. will $P_{min}$ always be larger for $K<0$ than for $K>0$ in the limit of small area?","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"

My attempt I’ve split the search into parts; at least intuitively (and WolframAlpha confirms), the only solutions are $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$. So, I’ve shown that these are the solutions for $m,n\le 2$ by direct calculation. Then, I analysed the last digits of the square difference in each case, first noting that: $$l(4^k)=\begin{cases}
4, 2\mid k\\
6, 2\nmid k
\end{cases}$$ And that: $$l(3^k)=\begin{cases}
3, k\equiv 1\: (\text{mod }4)\\
9, k\equiv 2\: (\text{mod }4)\\
7, k\equiv 3\: (\text{mod }4)\\
1, 4\mid k

For $2\mid m$ and $n\equiv 1 \text{ or } 2\: (\text{mod }4)$ and for $2\nmid m$ and $k \equiv 3 \text{ or } 0\: (\text{mod }4)$, the last digits are $3$ or $7$, so $p$ cannot be a natural number. However, I am not sure how I should go about the other $4$ cases.

This picture below is an example of a configuration which fails to fulfill the requirement. I don't actually have any clue on how one might go about solving such a question and that's why I'm asking.

I was wondering: Can one give a simpler, or more direct proof of Bochner's theorem if one assumes, in addition, that $\phi$ is integrable . I was hoping this would be a more accessible case since, then, there is a natural candidate for $\mu$, namely, the measure associated to the inverse Fourier transform of $\phi$: Let
$$
f_\phi(t) := \int e^{-iut}\phi(u)du

2794537,Set with no full or empty intervals [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Construct a Borel set on R such that it intersect every open interval with non-zero non-""full"" measure (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . Let $m(\cdot)$ denote Lebesgue measure. Does there exist an $S\subset [0,1]$ such that for all $a<b$ we would have $0<m([a,b]\cap S)<b-a$? I believe that the answer is yes, and I have a rough construction in mind. On the first step, allocate $1/4$ ""mass"" to either side of $1/2$ (this gives $S_1$).  Then recursively allocate $1/8$ mass to either side of $1/4$ and of $3/4$ (to get $S_2$).  Continue this process. At depth $d$ of the recursion, we have that for $a,b$ with binary expansions with at most $d$ digits, $m([a,b]\cap S_d)=(b-a)/2$.  Then in the limit, any interval can be written as the countable disjoint union of intervals with finite binary expansion, so (I think) $m([a,b]\cap S_d)=(b-a)/2$ holds for all $0<a<b<1$. I can describe the construction a bit more formally: For every $n$, consider the set of points with $n$ digits in its binary expansion.  There are $2^{n-1}$ such points since every digit is free, except for the last one which must be 1.  Place an interval of length $2^{-n}$ centered at each of those points.  Let $S_n$ be the union of those intervals. This would give us $S_1=[1/4,3/4],S_2=[1/8,3/8]\cup [5/8,7/8],\cdots$","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"

Let $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\subseteq C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda, E)$ be Cauchy. There is a unique $f\in B(\Lambda,E)$ with $$\left\|f-f_n\right\|_{B(\Lambda,\:E)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0.\tag1$$ Now, $$\frac{\left\|f(x)-f(y)\right\|_E}{d(x,y)^\alpha}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\left\|f_n(x)-f_n(y)\right\|_E}{d(x,y)^\alpha}\le\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|f_n\right\|_{C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,\:E)}<\infty$$ for all $x,y\in\Lambda$ with $x\ne y$ and hence $f\in C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,E)$ . Moreover, $$\frac{\left\|(f-f_n)(x)-(f-f_n)(y)\right\|_E}{d(x,y)^\alpha}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{\left\|(f_m-f_n)(x)-(f_m-f_n)(y)\right\|_E}{d(x,y)^\alpha}\le\limsup_{m\to\infty}\left\|f_m-f_n\right\|_{C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,\:E)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0$$ for all $x,y\in\Lambda$ with $x\ne y$ and hence $f\in C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,E)$ with $$[f-f_n]_{C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,\:E)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0.$$ We should be done. However, I've seen other people proving the claim in a different way. First of all, they assume that $\Lambda$ is open. Why should this be necessary? Moreover, they claim that the $f$ in my proof above can be chosen from $B(\overline\Lambda,E)$ and that $(1)$ holds with respect to $\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{B(\overline\Lambda,\:E)}$ . It's clear to me that (without the openness assumption), each $g\in C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,E)$ admits a unique extension $\tilde g\in C^{0+\alpha}(\overline\Lambda,E)$ with $$[\tilde g]_{C^{0+\alpha}(\overline\Lambda,\:E)}=[g]_{C^{0+\alpha}(\Lambda,\:E)}.$$ But I don't see why (if $f$ is chosen to be its unique extension $\tilde f$ ) the claimed convergence should hold (since we should only know that $\left\|f-f_n\right\|_{B(\Lambda,\:E)}\le\left\|f-f_n\right\|_{B(\overline\Lambda,\:E)}$ and we only know that the left-hand side converges as $n\to\infty$ ). However, as I said before, I don't see why this should be of any use at all. So, am I missing something?","['continuity', 'holder-spaces', 'analysis']"
2795027,The image of an Artin representation is finite,"First let us define the necessary terms for the problem: Definition Let $G$ be a profinite group and let $k$ be a topological field. An $n$ -dimensional representation of $G$ over $k$ is a continuous homomorphism of groups $\rho: G \to \operatorname{GL}_n(k)$ . An $n$ -dimensional representation of $G$ over $k$ is called an Artin representation if $k \subset \mathbb{C}$ , i.e. $k$ is a topological subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ . Problem : Now I would like to show that the image of an Artin representation is finite . My own progress so far : Since $\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{G}$ is a profinite group we know that $\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{G}$ is isomorphic to an inverse limit of a projective system of finitely many groups $\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{\{G_1,\dots,G_m\}}$ . In other words, $$ \require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{ G = \varprojlim_{i} G_i = \left\{ (\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_m) \in \prod_{i=1}^m G_i \: \middle| \: f^j_i(\gamma_j)=\gamma_i \: \forall j \geq i \right\}.}$$ That means that we can insert $m$ -tuples $\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{ (\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_m) }$ in our presentation $\rho$ which gives us elements $\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{ \rho(\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_m) \in \operatorname{GL}_n(k) }$ . Edit : I made a huge mistake ! In a projective limit, the groups are finite, not the system of groups! Now I have no idea at all again. But now I do not know how to continue so solve this problem anymore. My specific questions (besides "" How can I show this statement? ""): Why exactly do I need that $k$ is a topological subfield in $\mathbb{C}$ ? How do I handle the group homomorphisms $f^j_i : G_j \to G_i$ in our projective system? Do they play an important role for our problem? Any help is really appreciated.","['representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'profinite-groups', 'group-theory']"
2795043,Distributional limit of a sequence of Dirac delta,"I have to evaluate the following distributional limit: $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} T_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 1n \sum_{k=-2n}^{5n} \delta_{\frac kn}$$
We have that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty}\langle T_n, \phi\rangle =\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 1n \sum_{k=-2n}^{5n} \phi\left({\frac kn}\right)$$
Now my idea is to use an integral sum to evaluate this limit, in particular, I know that: $$ \lim_{n \to \infty}\underbrace{\frac{b-a}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n g\left(a+\frac{b-a}{n}k\right)}_{\text{integral sum}} = \int_a^b g(x) \: \mathrm{d}x$$
so i put $ \frac kn = a+\frac{b-a}{n}h=-2+\frac 7n h \implies h=\frac{k+2n}{7}$, and substituting this into my summation I get:
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 1n \sum_{k=-2n}^{5n} \phi\left({\frac kn}\right) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 1n \sum_{h=0}^{n} \phi\left(-2+\frac 7n k\right)\\
& =\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac 17 \frac 7n \sum_{h=0}^{n} \phi\left(-2+\frac 7n k\right)\\
&=\frac 17 \int_{-2}^{5} \phi(x) \: \mathrm{d}x
\end{align} Is that correct? Because my book says that the result should be what I got but without that $\frac 17$ coefficient. EDIT: I just realized that my substitution $h=\frac{k+2n}{7}$ doesn't seem correct since $h$ is not an integer in general as $k$ varies... so any idea?","['functional-analysis', 'dirac-delta', 'distribution-theory']"

For which values can $M_a$ be given a topology and smooth structure making it into an immersed submanifold? My attempt:
Let $F(x,y)=y^2-x(x-1)(x-a)$ so that $M_a=F^{-1}(0)$.\
 Then $DF(x,y)=[-(3x^2-(2a+2)x+a)~~ 2y]$. Therefore, $0$ is a regular value of $F$ unless there is a point $(x,y)$ such that $$y=0,3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0 ~\text{and}~ F(x,y)=-x(x-1)(x-a)=0.$$ In this case, $-x(x-1)(x-a)=0$ implies that $x=0$ or $x=1$ or $x=a$.\
When $x=0$, $3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0$ implies that $a=0$. When $x=1$, $3x^2-(2a+2)x+a=0$ implies that $a=1$. The case $x=a$ gives the above values. Thus we have the following cases to consider:
Case 1: $a=0, (x,y)=(0,0)$.
When $a=0$, the point $(0,0)$ is local minimum of $F$, so $(0,0)$ is an isolated point of $M_0$, and hence $M_0$ can not be an embedded or immersed submanifold.
my difficulty is in the following case:
Case 2: $a=1, (x,y)=(1,0)$.
when $a=1$, the point $(1,0)$ is saddle point of $F$, and thus the curve $M_1$ is self-intersecting at $(1,0)$. In such cases I saw examples saying it can not be an embedded submanifold but by giving an appropriate topology and smooth structure we can make  $M_1$ an immersed submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

By inclusion-exclusion principles and a little algebra, it is trivial to show $R$ has a probability distribution: $$\mathbb P(R=r)= \frac{N!}{N^r} \times {r-1 \brace N-1}. \quad R\ge N$$ Since $R$ is a sum of independent geometric random variables, it can be shown the probability generating function $g_R(t)$ is $$\mathbb E(t^R) = \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{N - i + 1}{N - (i - 1)t}. \quad |t| \lt \frac{N}{N - 1}$$ Define $X_i$ to be the value of the drawn coupon on each of the independent draws. They are i.i.d. with probability distribution $\mathbb P(X_i=x)= \dfrac 1N$, i.e. $X_i$ has a discrete uniform distribution with $ 1\le X_i \le N$. Therefore the probability generating function $\space g_{X_{i}}(t)$ is $$\mathbb E(t^{X_i}) = \frac {t \left({1 - t^N}\right)} {N \left({1 - t}\right)}. \quad |t| \lt 1$$ Therefore the random sum $T=\sum\limits_{i=1}^R X_i$ should have a convoluted probability generating function $$g_R(g_{X_{i}}(t))= \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{N - i + 1}{N - (i - 1) \times \dfrac {t \left({1 - t^N}\right)} {N \left({1 - t}\right)}}, \quad |t| \lt 1$$ which simplifies to
$$\prod_{i=1}^N \frac{N(1-t)(N - i + 1)}{N^2(1-t) - (i - 1) {t \left({1 - t^N}\right)}}.$$ I am as new as you can get to this site so sorry if I buggered something up! Never worked with latex so feel free to change any errors I made. Hopefully this is a fulfilling and interesting question and someone can find a naughty method. Given what I am doing is right (oops if I made a silly error and the answer is cat), if anyone can help with this fun looking convolution (I have chucked a few things at it and resulted in poop) it would be awesome! I have also tried it from first principles through computing $\mathbb P(T=t)$ using combinatorics and compositions but it seems I would need to read up a bit about A-restricted compositions, mostly of which I am having trouble getting my head around. Then again, I am stuck here too. Please help. Much appreciated. :) Links below are just formality for those unfamiliar with the base problem. The standard coupon collector's problem as can be found here . The term in the braces for the distribution of $R$ is the Stirling number of the second kind . Edit 1 Having thought about it for a few days, it seems this problem MAY be able to be done by the law of total probability. However I am still restricted by conditions on the collection, i.e. the number of each coupon collected should be at least $1$ to successfully complete the total. Let me explain: $$\mathbb P(T=t)= \sum_i \mathbb P(T=t \mid R=i) \mathbb P(R=i),$$ where $$i \in \left[ \bigg \lceil {\frac {T- \frac {N(N+1)}2}N} \bigg \rceil +N,N+ T-\frac {N(N+1)}2 \right]$$ So all we need is away to get $\mathbb P(T=t \mid R=i)$ for all $i$. And I know this can be achieved by finding: (1) How many ways in exactly $i-1$ steps we can get a total of $T-j$ for each for each $j \in [1,N]$, and divide it by: (2) the number of ways to finish in $i$ such that each number is rolled at least once not before collection step $i$. Lets think about the case $N=6$ (a fir 6-sided dice) and $T=22$ It is clear our limits for $i$ are from $[\max(6,1)+1,6+1]=[7,7]$, which this implies the only way to achieve total of $22$ where we roll every number from $1 \to 6$ at least once is in exactly $7$ rolls. Hopefully we can see that is the case intuitively. So (1) is calculated by all the permutations of $22-j$ without $j$ for each $j  \in [1,6]$ and (2) is calculated by all the permutations of finishing in $R=i$ goes, independent of finishing on a total of $22$. My issue is then calculating (1) and (to some extent without high knowledge of A-restricted compositions) (2)! Edit 2 I found a closed form for the simplest case N=2. Which is just a coin. With one side labeled a $1$. The other having a $2$. $X_i$ is discrete uniform with $P(X_i=1)=1-P(X_i=2)=\frac 12$. I want to get $P(T=t)$ for $T \ge3$. Let $T=3$. By counting, we can roll a total of 3 by:
$$(1,2) \ \ OR \ \ (2,1)$$
Either event has probability $\left( \frac 12 \right)^2$. So we have $P(T=3)=2\left( \frac 12 \right)^2=\left( \frac 12 \right)$ Let $T=4$. By counting, we can roll a total of 4 by:
$$(1,1,2)$$
This event has probability $\left( \frac 12 \right)^3$. So we have $P(T=4)=\left( \frac 18 \right)$ Here we do not count the event $(2,1,1)$ as a total of $4$ since by the second roll we have successfully achieved $D$. hence the actual total would be $3$ and we ignore the final $1$. Now, let $T=5$. By counting, we can roll a total of 5 by:
$$(1,1,1,2) \ \ OR \ \ (2,2,1)$$
The first event has probability $\left( \frac 12 \right)^4$. The second event has probability $\left( \frac 12 \right)^3$ So we have $P(T=5)=\left( \frac 12 \right)^4+ \left( \frac 12 \right)^3$ If we continue in this fashion, we will always have exactly 2 ways of rolling a total of $T=t$. One with probability to the power of $T-\sum_{i=1}^2i=T-3$ and the other with probability to the power of $\frac {T-3}2$ when T is odd and $0$ if even. We can hence write down the closed form for the simplest case where $N=2$ as: $$P(T=t|N=2)=\frac 14 \left(\left(\frac 12 \right)^{t-3}+\Bbb I_{t \ is \ odd} \left(\frac 12 \right)^{\frac{t-3}2} \right)$$ But of course this still leaves me with not knowing $N=3,4,5,...$ Edit 3 As well noted in the comments, the basic statistics for this problem follow from the definitions of $R$ and $X_i$. Firstly:
$$\Bbb E(T)=\Bbb E(\sum\limits_{i=1}^R X_i)$$. It is known that: 
$$\Bbb E(R)=N\ \sum\limits_{i=1}^N E(Z_i)=NH_N$$ for $H_n=\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac 1i$ the harmonic number. Since $X_i$ is uniform: $$\Bbb E(X_i)=\frac {N+1}2 \ \ \forall i$$ Putting it all together using Wald's identity we get:
$$\Bbb E(T)=\Bbb E(R)\Bbb E(X_i)=N\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac 1i \frac {N+1}2$$
$$=\frac 12 N(N+1) \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac 1i$$ Next lets consider the variance:
$$\Bbb V(T)=\Bbb V(\sum\limits_{i=1}^R X_i)$$ It is also known that (from properties of i.i.d. geometric random variables):
$$\Bbb V(R)=N\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac {i-1}{(N-i+1)^2}$$ Since $X_i$ is uniform:
$$\Bbb V(X_i)=\frac {N^2-1}{12} \ \ \forall i$$ Now using the identity for the variance of a random sum via law of iterated variance:
$$\Bbb V(T)=\Bbb E(R) \Bbb V(X_i) + [\Bbb E(X_i)]^2 \Bbb V(R)$$
$$=N \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac 1i \frac {N^2-1}{12}+\frac {(N+1)^2}4 \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac {N(i-1)}{(N-i+1)^2}$$
$$=\frac {N(N+1)(N-1)}{12} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac 1i+\frac {N(N+1)(N+1)}4 \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac {i-1}{(N-i+1)^2}$$
$$=\frac {N(N+1)}{12} \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \left[ \frac {N-1}i + \frac {3(N+1)(i-1)}{(N-i+1)^2} \right]$$ So for example when $N=6$, i.e. a die:
$$\Bbb E(T)=\frac 12 6(6+1) \sum\limits_{i=1}^6 \frac 1i=51.45$$
$$\Bbb V(T)=\frac {6(7)}{12} \sum\limits_{i=1}^6 \left[ \frac {5}i + \frac {3(7)(i-1)}{(6-i+1)^2} \right]=\frac {42}{12} 148.715= 520.5025$$ This makes sense. On average we roll $14.7$ times and get $3.5$ on each roll. $14.7 \cdot 3.5=51.45$. In fact, a simulation of $10$ million collections shows that these are the correct values: > mean(Test$Roll_Total)

2795510,"Is this random generation of a distribution over the [0,1] interval measurable?","So this is basically from an economics lecture (the lecturer introduced the voting model from myerson 1993 ). I have this feeling that the lecturer simplified this model though, so this might not be too related. Anyway, the idea is that you have a continuum of voters from the $[0,1]$ interval, and parties pick a redistribution platform. This is a distribution $t$ on the interval $[0,1]$ such that the expected value is $0$. Or in other words, the redistribution is zero sum. Now the result is apparently, that picking the transfer $t(x)$ for individuum $x$ randomly (iid) out of $U([-1,1])$ for all $x \in [0,1]$ is a Nash equilibrium. But is such a mapping $t:[0,1]\rightarrow[-1,1]$ even measurable? We will only get a probabilistic answer of course, but my guess would be that this mapping would almost surely be not measurable, given that the number of measurable mappings is of the size of the continuum still, while the total number of mappings would be the powerset of the continuum if I remember correctly. And since your randomly pick function values you will probably end up with a function from the larger set. But this is only my intuition and I don't really know how to formulate this. And does a continuum of iid random variables even exist?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'economics']"

I am studying this function on $[0, 2\pi] $ since it is periodic. My approach At intersection, we can say that the points $(r,\theta)$ and $ (r', \theta')$ are the same, for different values of theta, this can happen only if: $r = r$' and $ \theta = \theta' + 2k\pi$ or $r = -r'$ and $ \theta = \theta' + 2k\pi + \pi $. So I tried to replace, for the first case I get : 
$$1 + 2\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^2(\theta) = 1 + 2\cos(\theta' + 2k\pi) - 4\cos^2(\theta' + 2k\pi).$$ But since $\cos$ is $2\pi$-periodic then we get:
$$1 + 2\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^2(\theta) = 1 + 2\cos(\theta') - 4\cos^2(\theta' ).$$
Thus $\theta = \theta' + 2k\pi $ and we take $k = 0$ because the study domain is just $[0,2\pi]$ so I get that $\theta = \theta'$ and this cannot be a solution. For the second case where I use the fact that $\cos(\theta + 2k\pi + \pi ) = -\cos(\theta)$ then I get something like 1 = 1 which is not helpful . How would you find these points?

Prove that if every vertex in $A$ has degree at least $\frac32 n$ and $|A|\leq n^2$ , then $G$ has a matching which uses every vertex in $A$ . My proof: Use the Hall marriage theorem. Take any $X\subseteq A$ and let $|X|=k$ . Also let $Y=N(X)$ and $|Y|=l$ . Let us prove that $l\geq k$ . Assume that $l<k$ . Let $Y^*$ be a set of all unordered pairs $\{y_i,y_j\}$ , $i\ne j$ of elements in $Y$ , and connect a pair $\{y_i,y_j\}$ with $x\in X$ iff both $y_i$ and $y_j$ are adjacent with $x$ in $G$ . Then the degree of each pair in this new bipartite graph $G^*$ (on vertex set $X \cup Y^*$ ) is at most $1$ (since there is no $C_4$ in $G$ ) and the degree of each $x\in X$ is at least $\displaystyle{{3n\over 2}\choose 2}$ .

I understand that if $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K^\times$ then $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha)=\pm1$ but the converse is where I'm stuck. The proof I'm following (Neukirch `Algebraic Number Theory', page 12) argues that if $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha)= \pm1$ then $aN_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha)=1$ for some $a\in \{\pm1\}$, whence 
  $$
  1=aN_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha)=a\prod_{\sigma:K\rightarrow\overline{ \mathbb{Q}}}\sigma\alpha=a\alpha\prod_{\sigma\neq 1}\sigma\alpha=\alpha\beta

I understand that all the conjugates $\sigma\alpha$ of $\alpha$ are integral over $\Bbb{Z}$, but this does not, a priori, mean that each conjugate $\sigma\alpha$ lies in $\mathcal{O}_K:=\{x\in K\mid \text{$x$ integral over $\Bbb{Z}$}\}$ since each $\sigma \alpha$ may not be in $K$ itself. For example, if $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ then we know $\mathcal{O}_K=\Bbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}]$. The conjugates of, say, $\alpha=\sqrt[3]{2}$ are $$\sqrt[3]{2},\,\, \zeta\sqrt[3]{2},\,\,\zeta^2\sqrt[3]{2},$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive third root of unity. So in this case $\sigma\alpha\notin \mathcal{O}_K=\Bbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}]$ for $\sigma\neq 1$, even though $\prod_{\sigma\neq 1}\sigma\alpha=\sqrt[3]{4}\in  \mathcal{O}_K$.","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

2796042,"If $g \circ f $ and $f$ are covering maps, then so is $g$","Apologies for the long winded question. Recently I had a topology midterm which stated the following: If $g \circ f: X \to Z$ is a cover and $f: X \to Y$ is a cover, then prove that $g: Y \to Z$ is a cover. There were no assumptions on the spaces $X,Y,Z$, we were supposed to find the loosest conditions possible so that the above statement was true. A few weeks after the midterm, and much discussion with my classmates, we have not been able to find a solution yet. My idea for the proof is as follows: I will assume all spaces are locally connected. Let $p=g \circ f$ and fix $z \in Z$. Let $U$ be a connected fundamental neighborhood with respect to $p$, i.e. we may write $p^{-1}(U)$ as a collection of disjoint open sets each homeomorphic to $U$. Then, let $\{U_\alpha \}$ be the collection of connected components of $g^{-1}(U)$ these are open by the locally connected hypothesis. Let $p^{-1}(U)= \{W_\beta\}$. By definition, we know that $f(W_\beta) \subset U_\alpha$ for one such $\alpha$. This is because each $W_\beta$ is connected, being locally homeomorphic to $U$ and thus can map into at most one $U_\alpha$. Now, $f^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ must be a subcollection of $W_\beta$, call this collection $\{V_{\beta,\alpha}\}$. I claimed that $$f: \cup_\alpha V_{\beta,\alpha} \to U_\alpha $$ is a covering map. However, my instructor pointed out that this map may not be surjective in general. If it is then I believe we can conclude that $f: V_{\beta,\alpha} \to U_\alpha$ is a homeomorphism, which would complete the proof because $p: V_{\beta,\alpha} \to U$ is a homeomorphism. Hence $g$ must be too. My question is, does anyone know if we can prove that $f: V_{\beta,\alpha} \to U_\alpha$  is surjective here? Or is my approach wrong?

Does there exist a finitely additive probability measure $P$ on $(\mathbb{N}, 2^\mathbb{N})$ such that $P(\{n\}) = x_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$? It seems very likely to me that the answer is yes because it is well-known that there exists a finitely additive $\mu$ on $(\mathbb{N}, 2^\mathbb{N})$ that vanishes on singletons. $\mu$ embodies the most radical failure of countably additivity that is possible with $\sum_n \mu(\{n\}) = 0 \neq 1 = \mu(\mathbb{N})$. So surely less radical failures of countable additivity are possible too. That is my intuition anyway, but I'm not sure how to prove it. The only idea I have is the following. Define
$$P_n = \sum_{j=1}^n x_n \delta_n + \Big(1-\sum_{j=1}^nx_n\Big)\mu.$$
Since $P_n$ is a convex combination of finitely additive probabilities, it too is a finitely additive probability. Moreover, $P_n$ converges pointwise to a set function $P$ such that $P(\{n\})=x_n$. Since finitely additive probabilities are closed under pointwise convergence, $P$ is the desired finitely additive probability. Is that an okay proof?

Then $f$ is continuous into $[0, \infty)$. We note $E = \{X: f^{-1}([0,1)\}$ and $F = \{X: f^{-1}([0,1])\}$. So $E$ is open and $F$ is closed. Clearly $\bar{E} \subset F$. But I could not show the other direction (or possibly $\bar{E}$ is a proper subset of $F$). I tried to construct a sequence $\{X_n\}$ converging to $X \in F \setminus E$ by multiplying a factor $1-\varepsilon$ to $X$ but apparently to conclude $\bar{E} = F$ we need some kind of sublinearatily of spectral radius which is not true in general.","['general-topology', 'spectral-radius', 'linear-algebra']"
2796373,About of the curvature of Riemann as an operator,"Let $\left( M, g \right)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Then we have the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. I know that somehow you can define the curvature operator: $$ R_x: \Lambda^2 T_xM \rightarrow \Lambda^2 T_xM $$ But how do you define it to be a self-adjoint operator? How does it work on the basis elements? Maybe you will recommend me books, where is it defined in detail? Thank you very much!","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"
2796454,Determine the number of elements $f$ of $S_n$ for which $f(1) \ne 1$ and $f(2) \ne 2$.,"$S_n$ is the group consisting of the set of all bijections from $\{1,2,...,n\}$ to $\{1,2,...,n\}$. For $n\geq 2$, determine the number of elements $f$ of $S_n$ for which $f(1) \ne 1$ and $f(2) \ne 2$. The way I tried to solve it is by using the fact that $$|A \cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$$ Where $|A|$ is the amount of possible functions such that $f(1)\ne 1$ and $|B|$ is the amount of possible functions such that $f(2)\ne 2$. With this in mind, I let $|A| = n^n-n$ and $|B|=n^n-n$ but now I am stuck. Please help!","['elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics', 'functions', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2796511,How do I find out the value of $p$ for $\sin p + \cos p = 0$?,I tried doing this by putting $$\frac{ \sin p}{\sqrt2} +\frac{ \cos p}{\sqrt2} = 0 $$ which implies $$ \sin(p + π/4) = \sin 0 $$ which implies $p+ π/4 = nπ $. Now according to the question I'm solving $p = 2πt/T$. I need to get the relation $t = 3T/8$. How do I get this? Am I going the right way?,['trigonometry']
2796547,"Why continuity of $X$ needed for $\int_{g^{-1}(y)}^\infty f_X(x) \, dx = 1-F_X(g^{-1}(y))$?","Let $X$ be a random variable and $Y=g(X)$ Define
$$\tag{1}
\chi = \{x: f_X(x)>0\}\quad \text{and}\quad \mathcal{Y} = \{y:y=g(x) \text{ for some } x \in \chi\}
$$ Define $g^{-1}(y) = \{x\in \chi:g(x) = y\}$ Define: A random variable $X$ is continuous if $F_X(x)$ is a continuous function of $x$. My question is: how come, in the theorem below, the statement in (b) requires X to be a continuous random variable but the statement in (a) does not The relevant theorem is (Theorem 2.1.3 in Casella and Berger 2nd Edition) Let $X$ have cdf $F_X(x)$, let $Y=g(X)$, and let $\chi$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ be defined as in (1) (a) If $g$ is an increasing function on $\chi$, $F_Y(y) = F_X(g^{-1}(y))$ for $y\in \mathcal{Y}$ (b) If $g$ is a decreasing function on $\chi$ and $X$ is a continuous random variable, $F_Y(y) = 1-F_X(g^{-1}(y))$ for $y\in\mathcal{Y}$ Another way of stating what I am asking is that, prior to stating this theorem, Casella and Berger state if $g(x)$ is an increasing function, then using the fact that $F_Y(y) = \int_{x\in\chi : g(x)\leq y} f_X(x)dx$, we can write
  $$
F_Y(y) = \int_{x\in\chi : g(x)\leq y} f_X(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{g^{-1}(y)} f_X(x) \, dx = F_X(g^{-1}(y))
$$ If $g(x)$ is decreasing, then we have $$
F_Y(y) = \int_{g^{-1}(y)}^\infty f_X(x) \, dx = 1-F_X(g^{-1}(y))
$$ ""The continuity of $X$ is used to obtain the second equality My question(restated) is in yellow box below: My question (restated) is: How come, when $g(x)$ is an increasing function we do not need to use continuity of $X$, but we do for the case when $g(x)$ is decreasing? (A side question, I will accept answer so long as answers the above question): this is continuity of the random variable , but the integral uses the PDF. what is the relation between continuity of $X$ and it's pdf? (specifically, I think there may be some strangeness if $F_X$, the CDF of $X$ is continuous but not differentiable)? What came to my mind was Fundamental theorem of calculus maybe, but there is a version of it that doesn't require continuity of $f$ I think?  Plus, here we have $X$ is continuous, if that matters -- I'm not sure.","['continuity', 'probability-theory', 'integration']"

Then the systems should be solved using ode45 and an appropiate stiff solver in MATLAB. This leads to the following results: System 2 is clearly a stiff problem, right? But why isn't system three showing the same behaviour as the stiffness ratio $S$ is the same for both problems?
