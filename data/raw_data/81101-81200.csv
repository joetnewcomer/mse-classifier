1053127,Closed-form of $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\;(-1)^n \frac{\left(2-\sqrt{3}\right)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)^2\quad}$,"The following question is purely my curiosity. During my calculation to answer @Chris'ssis's question in chat room I encountered this series

I understand that this post will not help a lot of people, and for that I am sorry. I will make it up to you all by anwsering lots more questions in the future! However, as my lecturers enjoy time off on the weekend, I am unable to ask this to anyone else who would know what the heck I'm talking about. Sorry if my notation is not widely used, I can elaborate more if required. Please excuse my poor Latex too. Let: $B = Y^2 - X^3 + X$, and $F = (X^2 + Y^2)^3 - 4X^2Y^2$. I wish to find the intersection number of $B$ and $F$ at $P = (0,0)$ i.e $I(P,F \cap B). $ However, I want to use the following proposition to do this: If $P$ is simple on $B$ then $I(P,F \cap B) = ord_P^B(F) $. I will omit proving that $P$ is simple on $B$ as I hope it is clear to see it is. I know that $I(P,F \cap B) > M_p(F) * M_p(B) = 1 * 4 $, where $M_P(G)$ is the multiplicity of $P$ on $G$. Now, consider the Image of $X$ and $Y$: $K[X,Y] \longrightarrow \frac{K[X,Y]}{Y^2 - X^3 + X} \longrightarrow O_P(Y^2 - X^3 + X)$ $X \longrightarrow x$ $Y \longrightarrow y$ Where lower case denotes the image. Then $ord_P^{Y^2 - X^3 + X}((X^2 + Y^2)^3 - 4X^2Y^2)$ Can be found by substituting $y^2 = x^3 - x$ into $(x^2 + y^2)^3 - 4x^2y^2$ Which gives: $ord_P^{Y^2 - X^3 + X}(x^9+3x^8 -5x^6 -4x^5 +3x^4 +3x^3)=3$ i.e $I(P,F \cap B) = 3$, a contradiction to  $I(P,F \cap B) > 4$ as above.

I have found the solution of this exercise but I have quesions on that. So I will start writing the solution step by step and make the relevant questions for each step. Why $XX^T$ is expressed as an outer product? We have $XX^T \geq 0$ and $rank(XX^T) = k$ (using SVD on X). Why it is that? A positive linear combination of such matrices can have $rank$ up to n, but never less than k. Is there specific theorem about that? Then a proof follows on 3: Let $A,B\geq 0$ of $rank$ k. (This came from the exercise definition.) With $rank(A+B)=r\leq k$ . We know that $rank(A+B) \leq rank(A) + rank(B) = 2k$ . Why $rank(A+B)=r\leq k$ holds? Let $V\in R^{n \times (n-r)}$ such that $\mathcal{R}(V) = \mathcal{N(A+B)}$ . Why it is that? We have $V: R^{n-r}\to R^n$ and $A: R^k \to R^n$ , $\mathcal{N(A+B) \subseteq R^n}$ and $\mathcal{R(V) \subseteq R^n}$ . Since $A,B \geq 0$ , this means $V^TAV = V^TBV = 0$ , which implies that $rank(A)\leq r$ and $rank(A)\leq r$ , which is a contradiction. Why the last two inequalities hold? Then they conclude that $rank(A+B) \geq k$ for any $A$ , $B$ such that $rank(A)=rank(B)=k$ and $A,B \geq 0$ . (This is because of 4.) Conversely, any non-zero matrix of $rank$ at least k can be written as the sum of several matrices of $rank$ k (using SVD decomposition for of $A = XX^T = UΣV^T$ and note that the diagonal of Σ has at least k positive entries). How is that contribute to the proof? Concludes that, that the conic hull of the set of $rank$ -k outer products is the set of positive semi-definite matrices of $rank$ greater than or equal to k, along with the zero matrix. How they come up with his idea? And more specifically, how the zero matrix is involved on that. Any help on each of them is highly appreciated.

Assumptions and Facts: We know that $\overline{V} = a-bi$ is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\overline{\lambda}$. We obviously have that $V$ and $\overline{V}$ are linearly independent. (For one thing, eigenvectors of distinct eingenvalues must be LI.) I have started a few ways by trying to find a contradiction, assuming that there is a nonzero $k \in \mathbb{R}$ such $\mathrm{Re}(V)$ = $k\mathrm{Im}(V)$. I tried using the definitions of $\mathrm{Re}(V)$ and $\mathrm{Im}(V)$ in terms of $V$ and $\overline{V}$ but that didn't get me anywhere. I tried starting with the fact that $V$ and $\overline{V}$ are LI to show this directly implies that $V$ and $\overline{V}$ line must be LI. I also couldn't work this through.

1053700,Let $(x_n)$ be an integer Cauchy sequence. Prove that $x_n$ is eventually constant.,"I'm working on the following problem. Let $(x_n)$ be an integer Cauchy sequence, i.e. $x_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that $x_n$ is eventually constant, i.e. there exists $N$ so that $x_n = c$ whenever $n \ge N$. My attempt: Let $(x_n)$ be an integer Cauchy sequence. By the Cauchy convergence theorem, $x_n \to x$, for some $x$. Given $\epsilon >0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $$
|x_n - x | < \epsilon 
$$ whenever $n \ge N$. Take $\epsilon < 1$ in the definition so that $$
|x_n - x| < 1
$$ But, if the distance between two integers is less than 1, they must be equal. Thus, $x_n = x$ whenever $n \ge N$. Now, I think my logic is sound except for the huge assumption that $x_n$ converges to an integer. Would anyone be able to tell me if i'm on the right track? Is there any way to show that $x_n$ converges to an integer?","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

(1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . I am looking to find the intersection number of the affine plane curves $F=Y^2-X^3+X$ and $G=(X^2+Y^2)^3-4X^2Y^2$, and I need to do it with the order function of the local ring of $F$ at the origin. So my attempt goes as follows: $$k[X,Y] \twoheadrightarrow \Gamma(F)=k[X,Y]/(F) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{(0,0)}(F)$$
$$ G \mapsto \bar{G} = G\mod (F) \mapsto \frac{\bar{G}}{1} $$ Then I get the intersection number as $I((0,0),F\cap G) = \text{Ord}_{(0,0)}^F(\bar{G})$. For the map onto the coordinate ring of $F$, I wrote $X\mapsto x, Y\mapsto y : y^2=x^3-x$. From there I thought that $\bar{G} = (x^2+(x^3-x))^3 - 4x^2(x^3-x)$. The map into the local ring (which I know should be a DVR as the origin is a simple point of $F$) is a natural injection, so I thought I should be able to write $\bar{G} = u\cdot t^n$ as one can do in a DVR.

We have a pool of $n$ people, each of whom is supposed to be assigned another member of the pool to find a gift for, without the recipient knowing whom they've been assigned to. Essentially, we would like to generate a random derangement without leaking too much (or ideally, any) information about it to the participants, beyond the name of the person they're assigned to. Obviously we could use a trusted third party or online organizer to do this, but that's not much fun to do at a party, so it'd be better if we could use some method that could be implemented by hand, solely by the participants. While everyone should ideally have an equal chance of getting assigned to everyone else, it's probably okay if our algorithm is nonuniform over cycle types. In fact, it'd be kind of neat if there was a way of doing this that always generated $n$-cycles, since that would also let you play a self-running Assassin game. There are two obvious algorithms for doing this: 1) Everyone pulls a name out of a hat, and checks to see if they've drawn their own name. If so, everyone puts the names back and starts over. This works fine (it's essentially the rejection algorithm for generating random derangements), but is kind of tedious. And there's a tendency for it to degenerate into: 2) Everyone pulls a name out of a hat one by one. If you get your own name, put it back and draw again. This can fail if the last person draws their own name (at which point you'd have to start over from the beginning). It also leaks information. If someone puts their own name back, that means none of their predecessors can have drawn it; in the extreme case, if person $n-1$ puts their own name back, it's guaranteed to be drawn by person $n$. Additionally, it's not actually uniform, as discussed in this answer . One could also try to implement something like Sattolo's algorithm to get an $n$-cycle, or the algorithm in this paper to get a general derangement, but I haven't been able to come up with a way to do that by hand without leaking information. Is there any way of doing this that works better than algorithms 1) or 2), at least arguably?

Could someone please provide some clarifications as well as a step by step example of the proper way of implementing transfinite induction. Thanks. EDIT: I now see the reasoning for setting up the induction, but take a look at this proof of showing that every vector space has a basis. Proof: Let V be a vector space. By the well-ordering theorem, there is a well-ordering of the elements of V. Therefore, there is an ordinal $\alpha$ such that the elements of $V$ can be put into one-to-one correspondence with $\alpha.$ For each $\beta<\alpha$, let us write $v_\beta$ for the element of $V$ that corresponds to $\beta.$ Now let $B$ be the set of all $v_\beta$ that do not belong to the linear span of their predecessors. It is clear that $B$ is linearly independent. It also spans, since every $v_\beta$ either belongs to $B$ or is a linear combination of earlier elements of $B$, and every element of $V$ is $v_\beta$ for some $\beta.$ Question 2 :I don't see any of the distinct steps of transfinite induction in here, yet it is considered a proof by transfinite induction.

Yet how do we use the setup? $U_1, U_2$ have equal diagonals, so $U_1 = D+N_1, U_2=D+N_2$ (for a diagonal $D$ and nilpotent $N_1, N_2$). From the distinctness of the eigenvalues follows that $M$ is diagonalizable but I don't quite see how to use it either. Any hints are hugely appreciated.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'adjoint-operators', 'diagonalization']"
