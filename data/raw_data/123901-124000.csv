1870385,Geometric equivalent of the degree zero divisor class group of an algebraic function field (in the singular case),"In an algebraic function field $F/k$ we have the degree zero divisor class group $\text{Cl}^0(F/k)$. Now since any such function field corresponds to the function field of a normal projective curve over $k$ (in particular regular, Noetherian), it seems to me quite reasonable to ask about the corresponding object in this geometric case. How does it look like, is it simply the same, only dealing with cartier divisors? And further: Does anything change if we don't start with the function field but with a $\underline{\text{non-regular}}$ integral and complete (projective) curve over $k$?","['algebraic-curves', 'function-fields', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1870444,Is a data set really a set?,"Originally I thought that in statistics, a data set is just a set of real numbers, and that was it. But in the case of a set, there can only be one instance of any given entry, e.g. in  set theory $$\left \{ 1,2,2 \right \}=\left \{ 1,2 \right \}$$ A set of this form in set theory may also be called an unordered pair . But from the point of view of statistics the objects on both sides of the equation are distinct, e.g. the left one has a mode, while the right one doesn't; the left one's arithmetic mean is $\frac{5}{3}$, while the arithmetic mean of the right one is $\frac{3}{2}$. Question: are the concepts of data set in statistics and set in set theory really different things? Are data sets of real numbers in statistics really $n$-tuples of set theory in disguise, or taken to be ones most of the time implicitly?","['terminology', 'statistics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1870460,A necessary and sufficient condition such that product of partial isometries is a partial isometry,"I'm reading the paper P. Halmos, L. Wallen, Powers of Partial Isometries, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 19 No. 8 (1970), 657–663
( http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/docs/19054/19054.asp ).
And I got stuck on the proof of Lemma 2, which states that $$\text{If } U_1 \text{and } U_2 \text{ are partial isometries, then a necessary and sufficient condition that } \\U_1U_2 \text{ be a partial isometry is that } E_1 \text{ and } F_2 \text{ commute, where } E_1={U_1}^*U_1 \text{and } F_2=U_2{U_2}^*.$$ Proof Put $U = U_1U_2$. Assume first that $E_1$ and $F_2$ commute. Then $$UU^*U = U_1U_2({U_2}^*{U_1}^*)U_1U_2 = U_1F_2E_1U_2 = U_1E_1F_2U_2 = U_1U_2 = U.$$ Since the equation $UU^*U=U$ is characteristic if partial isometries, this proves that the condition is sufficient. To prove necessity, assume that $UU^*U=U$. Then, as above, $U_1F_2E_1U_2=U_1U_2$, and therefore $$E_1F_2E_1F_2=({U_1}^*U_1F_2)(E_1U_2{U_2}^*)=({U_1}^*U_1)(U_2{U_2}^*)=E_1F_2,$$ so that $E_1F_2$ is idempotent. Since $||E_1F_2|| \leq 1$, it follows that $E_1F_2$ is Hermitian, and hence that $E_1F_2$ commute. I can't understand why we can conclude that $E_1F_2$ is Hermitian given that it is idempotent and bounded.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory']"
1870482,If $|G|=p^3q^2$ then $\Phi(G)$ is cyclic for primes $p\neq q$.,"I have conjectured this result for the Frattini subgroup by doing some calculations in GAP. I think this is even true if $|G|=p_1^{i_1}\cdots p_n^{i_n}$ for $i_j\leq 3$ holds, but I would like to stick with this example first. I know the following: If $p\mid |G|$, then $p\mid |G/\Phi(G)|$, thus the order of $\Phi(G)$ is at most $p^2q$. Since $\Phi(G)$ is nilpotent, it must be abelian, too. That's why I think that it suffices to show this result for only abelian $G$ (which is fairly easy), as considering all abelian groups with that order would lead to all possible abelian $\Phi(G)$. But I still need a valid argument for that. I also tried the assumption $\Phi(G)=C_p\times C_p$ or $\Phi(G)=C_p\times C_p\times C_q$ but I have not yet found a contradiction. I would be glad to see some ideas or approaches for this conjecture.","['conjectures', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'frattini-subgroup', 'group-theory']"

1870514,Viewing complex projective space as a Grassmannian manifold,"Complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^n$ carries the structure of a complex manifold of dimension $n$, hence has the underlying structure of a real manifold of dimension $2n$. It is the set of complex lines (which are planes in the real vector space sense) through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ (equivalently $\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$). With this view, there is an apparent equivalence between $\mathbb{CP}^n$ and the Grassmannian $Gr_2(\mathbb{R}^{2n+2})$, i.e. the set the two-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$. But $\dim{Gr_k(V)}=k(n-k)$ if $\dim{V}=n$, and hence $\dim(Gr_2(\mathbb{R}^{2n+2}))=2((2n+2)-2)=4n$ which is twice the real dimension of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ - what am I missing here?","['smooth-manifolds', 'grassmannian', 'projective-space', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

1870540,"Three length 3 ""gapped"" straights vs. one length 6 straight. Which is more likely and by how much?","Using  a well shuffled standard $52$ card deck, $2$ players (call them A and B) decide to play a game.  They draw community (shared) cards (without replacement) until a winner for that hand is declared or they run out of cards to draw, whichever comes first.  For A to win, there has to be three length $3$ ascending straights drawn in order such as $6,7,8$ ... $2,3,4$... $10,J,Q$.  The $3$ straights have to all be ""gapped"" by at least $1$ rank so something like $7,8,9$ ... $10,J,Q$ ... $2,3,4$ is not a winner for A because of the $9$ and $10$ not being gapped.  The rank $2$ card is considered the lowest card and the $A$ card is considered the highest ranked card so $A,2,3$ is NOT considered a straight.  For B to win, there has to be a straight of length $6$ such as $7,8,9,10,J,Q$. So who has the higher probability to win and by how much? My initial simulation had an error in it so I fixed and am rerunning it. An example of a tie would be  $2,3,4,6,7,8,7,8,9,10,J,Q$  The Q gives A and B the last card needed at the same time so that is a tie (no win for either). I am now trying to do some mathematical analysis on paper starting with simple enumeration of the different ways for A to win.  I see $10$ patterns: $~1$) $2,3,4,6,7,8,10,J,Q$ $~2$) $2,3,4,6,7,8,J,Q,K$ $~3$) $2,3,4,6,7,8,Q,K,A$ $~4$) $2,3,4,7,8,9,J,Q,K$ $~5$) $2,3,4,7,8,9,Q,K,A$ $~6$) $2,3,4,8,9,10,Q,K,A$ $~7$) $3,4,5,7,8,9,J,Q,K$ $~8$) $3,4,5,7,8,9,Q,K,A$ $~9$) $3,4,5,8,9,10,Q,K,A$ $10$) $4,5,6,8,9,10,Q,K,A$ For player B to win, there are only $8$ ways: $1)~ 2,3,4,5,6,7$ $2)~ 3,4,5,6,7,8$ $3)~ 4,5,6,7,8,9$ $4)~ 5,6,7,8,9,10$ $5)~ 6,7,8,9,10,J$ $6)~ 7,8,9,10,J,Q$ $7)~ 8,9,10,J,Q,K$ $8)~ 9,10,J,Q,K,A$ What I will do is create a bucket for each possible  pattern (way) to win shown above and count them up to make sure the program is catching all of them.  I think they should all be equally likely. What if we started by just doing a ""straight"" analysis of the probability or A winning ignoring any cases where B wins first?  What if we also do the same thing and compute the chances of B winning ignoring cases where A wins first.  I wonder how far off those will be from the simulated results. Would this analysis be correct for computing the chance of B winning if there was no player A? Chance of choosing good 1st card is $32/52$, good 2nd card is $4/51$, good 3rd card is $4/50$, good 4th card is $4/49$, good 5th card is $4/48$, and good 6th card is $4/47$.  This is about $1$ in $447,000$ but that is only counting an immediate win for B with only $6$ cards drawn.  B can use the full deck if need be to win so how do I compute that using math?  In other words, if the only player is B how many hands on average will be required for a B win?","['probability', 'card-games']"

1870620,About codifying length and energy using a one-form,"Let $M^n$ be a smooth manifold and $g$ be a Riemannian metric on $M$. Is there $\omega \in \Omega^1(M)$ such that $\int_c \omega = \ell(c)$ for every curve in $M$? In general the answer seems to be no. In Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry (volume $1$) he gives this argument for $\Bbb R^2$ with the usual metric: if $\omega$ is such a non-zero form, then $\ker \omega$ is a one dimensional distribution in $\Bbb R^2$ - and every curve contained in a integral submanifold of $\ker \omega$ will have length zero. If in the general case we consider $\omega$ a non-zero form, then $\ker \omega$ will be a $(n-1)-$dimensional distribution in $M$, which, by Frobenius' theorem, will be integrable if and only if $\omega \wedge {\rm d}\omega = 0$ (see for example here ). If such condition holds we proceed like in the $\Bbb R^2$ case (in which the condition holds trivially). But I see no reason for that condition to necessarily hold. Is there an example of manifold with a one-form like this? This also leads me to wonder (from here on it's mostly food for thought and I'll be happy with the previous question answered): what if $g$ is pseudo-Riemannian? The possibility of lightlike curves in the integral submanifold seems to make the reasoning above fail. what if we looked at energy instead of length? The situation seems the same, but energy depends on the parametrization, which ends up depending on a coordinate system (ok, maybe that second question is not so interesting after all)","['semi-riemannian-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

1870686,Hyperbolic metric geodesically complete,"Consider the upper half plane model of the hyperbolic space ($\mathbb{H}$ with the riemannian metric $g=\frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}$). It is known that $(\mathbb{H},g)$ is geodesically complete, which means that no geodesic can reach the border $\partial \mathbb{H}$ in a finite time. Why is that? Of course if I consider particular geodesics such as $t\mapsto (0,e^{-t})$ this is true, but I can't figure out a general proof for this fact which doesn't rely on the particular form of the geodesic considered. My intuition is that it must depend on the fact that, as a geodesic approaches the border, the denominator of $g$ goes to $0$. Can you point me out an explanatory proof which shows that the length of a hyperbolic geodesic which goes to the border can't be finite?

1870690,Evaluating the sums $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{kn}{n}}$ with $k$ a positive integer,"How to evaluate the sums $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{kn}{n}}$ with $k$ a positive integer? For $k=1$, the series does not converge. When $k=2$, I can prove that: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{2n}{n}}=\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}$$
Usually, this can be proven by differentiating $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n^2 \binom{2n}{n}}=2(\arcsin{\frac{x}{2}})^2$, but I have an alternative proof. Using the result of: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^ndx}{(x+1)^{y+n+1}}=\frac{1}{y \binom{y+n}{n}} \tag1$$
, which can be easily proved. I can substitute $y=n$ to obtain $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^ndx}{(x+1)^{2n+1}}=\frac{1}{n \binom{2n}{n}}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_0^\infty \frac{x^ndx}{(x+1)^{2n+1}}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{2n}{n}}$$
Therefore, \begin{align}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{2n}{n}} & = \int_0^\infty \frac{xdx}{(x+1)(x^2+x+1)} \\
 & = \lim_{L\to \infty}  \frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+x+1)-\ln(x+1)+\frac{\tan^{-1}(\frac{2x+1}{\sqrt{3}})}{\sqrt{3}}\large{|_0^L} \\
&= \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}
\end{align} Now for $k=3$, I tried to substitute $y=2n$ into $(1)$: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^ndx}{(x+1)^{3n+1}}=\frac{1}{2n \binom{3n}{n}}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_0^\infty \frac{x^ndx}{(x+1)^{3n+1}}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2n \binom{3n}{n}}$$
So we can have $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{3n}{n}}=\int_0^\infty\frac{2xdx}{(x+1)(x^3+3x^2+2x+1)}$$
However, by partial fraction $$\frac{2xdx}{(x+1)(x^3+3x^2+2x+1)}=-\frac{2}{1+x}+\frac{2x^2+4x+2}{x^3+3x^2+2x+1}$$
The left part does not seem to converge. Feeling frustrated, Wolfram Alpha plays its part. It spits out these results: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{3n}{n}}=\frac{1}{3}{}_3F_2\left(\left.\begin{array}{c} 1,1,\frac{3}{2}\\ \frac{4}{3}, \frac{5}{3}  \end{array}\right| \frac{4}{27}\right)$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{4n}{n}}=\frac{1}{4}{}_4F_3\left(\left.\begin{array}{c} 1,1,\frac{4}{3},\frac{5}{3}\\ \frac{5}{4}, \frac{6}{4}, \frac{7}{4}  \end{array}\right| \frac{27}{256}\right)$$
However, I am not very familiar with hypergeometric function. The pattern suggests that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{2n}{n}}=\frac{1}{2}{}_2F_1\left(\left.\begin{array}{c} 1,1\\ \frac{3}{2}  \end{array}\right| \frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}$$
Thus, $${}_2F_1\left(\left.\begin{array}{c} 1,1\\ \frac{3}{2}  \end{array}\right| \frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{2\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}$$ Arriving these results, I have the following questions: How can ${}_2F_1\left(\left.\begin{array}{c} 1,1\\ \frac{3}{2}  \end{array}\right| \frac{1}{4}\right)$ be expressed into this simple elementary form? How can we arrive to the result for $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n \binom{3n}{n}}$ given by Wolfram Alpha?

1870827,Should we re-define Sine?,"Sine is usually defined as the ratio of the opposite side to an angle to the hypotenuse in a right angle triangle . Another common definition is based on the unit circle. However I think these geometrical definitions could lead to confusion and misconception. I’ve been wondering about this for a while so now I’m bringing some reasons for this argue and want to know whether this taught is right or not. Here’s the confusion which this definition causes: When taking oscillatory motion lessons, students are told about the Differential Equations. The very first equation they learn is $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+ky=0$$ Then the solution for that is written as $y=A\sin(\sqrt{k}x+\phi)$ and questions begin to raise: “Where did that sine come from?!”. The typical answer would be: “See, if you take the second derivative and put it in, it satisfies the equation”. “Yes, that’s true but… where is the circle? Where is the angle? There’s just an object connected to a spring”. And so on, many students have problems. This confusion occurs because, when you first defined the sine function for them, there was a circle, and the argument was an angle and so on. It’s no wonder if those less curious students accept this phenomenon (that an object connected to a spring moves like sine function) as accident or something like that and pass.
To solve this, I’m suggesting a re-definition. We can define sine as The answer to $y’’+ay=0$ considering $y(0)=0$ and $y’(0)=1$ . It can be proved (with a little effort) that the opposite/hypotenuse ratio also obeys the same differential equation so by [the new] definition, this ratio would be equal to sine of the angle. This should resolve the issues discussed above.
Another interesting subject is pi which is related to this discussion. I think I can convince you that pi could be quite confusing: One day, looking at the formulas in some book or other, I discovered a
formula for the frequency of a resonant circuit. There was a mystery
about this number that I didn't understand as a youth, but this was a
great thing, and the result as that I looked for pi everywhere. [??Something missing here] which was f = 1/2 pi LC, where L is the
inductance and C [is] the capacitance of the [capacitor, and there was
also a pi. But where is the] circle? You laugh, but I was very serious
then. Pi was a thing with circles, and here is pi coming out of an
electric circuit. Where was the circle? Do those of you who laughed
know how that comes about? I have to love the thing. I have to look
for it. I have to think about it. And then I realized, of course, that
the coils are made in circles. About a half year later, I found
another book which gave the inductance of round coils and square
coils, and there were other pi's in those formulas. I began to think
about it again, and I realized that the pi did not come from the
circular coils. I understand it better now; but in my heart I still
don't know where that circle is, where that pi comes from. Richard Feynman – “What is science?” Another example from the famous article: THERE IS A story about two friends, who were classmates in high
school, talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician
and was working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his
former classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian
distribution and the statistician explained to his former classmate
the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, for the average
population, and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not
quite sure whether the statistician was pulling his leg. ""How can you
know that?"" was his query. ""And what is this symbol here?"" ""Oh,"" said
the statistician, ""this is pi."" ""What is that?"" ""The ratio of the
circumference of the circle to its diameter."" ""Well, now you are
pushing your joke too far,"" said the classmate, ""surely the population
has nothing to do with the circumference of the circle."" Naturally, we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the
classmate's approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to
admit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the
classmate betrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused
when, not many days later, someone came to me and expressed his
bewilderment [1 The remark to be quoted was made by F. Werner when he
was a student in Princeton.] with the fact that we make a rather
narrow selection when choosing the data on which we test our theories.
""How do we know that, if we made a theory which focuses its attention
on phenomena we disregard and disregards some of the phenomena now
commanding our attention, that we could not build another theory which
has little in common with the present one but which, nevertheless,
explains just as many phenomena as the present theory?"" It has to be
admitted that we have no definite evidence that there is no such
theory. The preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which
are the subjects of the present discourse. The first point is that
mathematical concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections.
Moreover, they often permit an unexpectedly close and accurate
description of the phenomena in these connections. Secondly, … Eugene Wigner – “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the
Natural Sciences” So after all these stories from big minds, we can see that curious minds have difficulty relating pi to equations which don’t even involve a circle. But if we instead define pi as half of sine function period (newly defined one), then usage of pi in absence of circles and triangles would not be a surprise. At the end of this long post, I want to ask for opinions. I wonder if all what I said above makes sense or not? Math is a precise area and definitions are everything, so I think what I’m asking here is an important question. Edit: A few friends here have marked this as ""Opinion Based"". Thanks for reading my question, but I really don't see how can a definition be ""Opinion Based"", in a precise field like math. So the only way I can imagine is that the two be ""equivalent"", which is what I'm somehow concluding from the answers, but still looking for a clear proof for that point which I don't see here.","['trigonometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'definition']"

Some time ago, I wanted to find many proofs (like here ) that $\Bbb Z[X]$ and $\Bbb R[X]$ are not isomorphic (obviously they are not because they don't even have the same cardinality, I know).

1871021,"Correspondence to Parameter Space, but not Moduli Space?","I've been thinking recently about some nice moduli problems in algebraic geometry as well as the relationship of moduli spaces to string theory, gauge theory, and such.  Mathematically, to my understanding, we first find some parameter space for certain objects, and then quotient by whatever we want to identify, passing us to the moduli space.  Physicists speak of perhaps having some initial parameter space, or ""theory space"" and then identifying certain points based on symmetries or dualities.  It seems like there's a slew of hugely beautiful examples where mathematically what we quotient by to pass to the moduli space corresponds precisely to the same purely physical identification, giving us an exact correspondence to the moduli space.  The main example that comes to mind is the elliptic curve: whenever an elliptic curve appears, it seems like there's a purely physical reason to identify two ""theories"" which are exchanged by $\tau \to -1/\tau$. So my question is, are there examples (either in pure maths, or at the interface of math/physics) where something corresponds to the parameter space of some class of objects, but not the proper moduli space itself?  Or perhaps, I should ask, if one comes across such a scenario, what is this hinting at?  Is it hinting that the two things are not really connected in any nice way?  Again, maybe as a simple example, one might have something resembling an elliptic curve which is invariant under $\tau \to \tau + 1$, but not $\tau \to -1/\tau$.  Are there examples where a nice correspondence can still exist between two such things, or is this a sign that the two are not really connected?",['algebraic-geometry']

1871026,Does a non-trivial solution exist for $f'(x)=f(f(x))$?,"Does $f'(x)=f(f(x))$ have any solutions other than $f(x)=0$? I have become convinced that it does (see below), but I don't know of any way to prove this. Is there a nice method for solving this kind of equation? If this equation doesn't have any non-trivial solutions, do you know of any similar equations (i.e. involving both nested functions and derivatives) that do have interesting solutions? If we assume $f$ is analytic (which I will be doing from this point onward), then it must also be injective (see alex.jordan's attempted proof), and therefore has at most one root (call it $x_0$.) We know $f'(x_0)=f(f(x_0))=f(0)$. Claim: $f$ cannot have a positive root. Suppose $x_0$ is positive. If $f(0)$ is negative, then for some sufficiently small $\delta>0$, $f(x_0-\delta)>0$. This implies there must be another root between $x_0$ and $0$, but $f$ has at most one root. The same reasoning applies if $f(0)$ is positive. If $f(0)=0$, then both $x_0$ and $0$ are roots. Thus, we conclude that $x_0$ cannot be positive. Claim: $f$ cannot have zero as a root. Suppose $x_0=0$. Since $f$ has at most one root, we know $f$ will be of constant sign on each of the positive and negative halves of the $x$ axis. Let $a<0$. If $f(a)<0$, this implies $f'(a)=f(f(a))<0$, so on the negative half of the real line, $f$ is negative and strictly decreasing. This contradicts the assumption that $f(0)=0$. Therefore, $a<0\implies f(a)>0$, which then implies $f'(a)<0$. But since $f'(a)=f(f(a))$, and $f(a)>0$, this implies $f(b)<0$ when $b>0$. Moreover, we know $f'(b)=f(f(b))$, and $f(b)<0 \implies f(f(b))>0$, so we know $f$ is negative and strictly increasing on the positive half of the real line. This contradicts the assumption that $f(0)=0$. Claim: $f$ is bounded below by $x_0$ (which we've proved must be negative if it exists) We know $f(x_0)=0$ is the only root, so $f'(x)=0$ iff $f(x)=x_0$. And since $f$ is injective, it follows that $f$ is either bounded above or bounded below by $x_0$ (if $f$ crossed $y=x_0$, that would correspond to a local minimum or maximum.) Since $f(x_0)=0$ and $x_0<0$, we know $x_0$ must be a lower bound. Claim: $f$ is strictly decreasing. Question B5 from the 2010 Putnam math competition rules out strictly increasing functions, so we know $f$ must be strictly decreasing. Claim: $f$ has linear asymptotes at $\pm \infty$ Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and bounded below by $x_0$, we know $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)$ is well defined, and $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f'(x)=0$. Since $f'(x)=0$ iff $f(x)=x_0$, it follows that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)=x_0$. $f''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f'(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f(f(x))=f'(f(x))f'(x)$. Since $f'(x)<0$, we know $f$ is concave up. Thus, $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)\rightarrow\infty$. This in turn implies $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f'(x)=\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(f(x))=\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}f(x)=x_0$. So $f$ goes to $x_0$ when $x\rightarrow\infty$, and approaches the asymptote $y=x_0\cdot x$ when $x\rightarrow-\infty$. Claim: $x_0<1$ Consider the tangent line at $f(x_0)$. We know $f'(x_0)=f(0)$, so this line is given by $y=f(0)x-f(0)x_0$. Since $f$ is concave up, we know $f(x) > f(0)x-f(0)x_0$ for $x\neq x_0$, so $f(0) > -f(0)x_0$. And we can conclude $x_0<-1$. Claim: $f$ must have a fixed point, $x_p$ (i.e. $f(x_p)=x_p$) We know $f(x_0)=0$, $x_0<0$, and $f(0)<0$. Therefore, $f(x)-x$ has a root in the interval $(x_0,0)$. This is all I have been able to prove. However, the existence of a fixed point turns out to be very useful in constructing approximate solutions. Consider the following: $$f(x_p)=x_p$$
$$f'(x_p)=f(f(x_p))=x_p$$
$$f''(x_p)=f'(f(x_p))f'(x_p)=f(f(f(x_p)))f(f(x_p))=x_p^2$$
$$f'''(x_p)=\cdots=x_p^4+x_p^3$$ If we are willing to put in the work, we can evaluate any derivative at the fixed point. I wrote a python program that computes these terms (unfortunately it runs in exponential time, but it's still fast enough to compute the first 20 or so terms in a reasonable amount of time). It leverages the following bit of information. Suppose $f^{[n]}$ represents the nth iterate of $f$. e.g. $f^{[3]}=f(f(f(x)))$. Then we can derive the following recursive formula. $$\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n]}=f'(f^{[n-1]})\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n-1]}=f^{[n+1]}\frac{d}{dx}f^{[n-1]}$$ And since we know the base case $\frac{d}{dx}f^{[1]}=f^{[2]}$, this lets us determine $(f^{[n]})'=f^{[n+1]}f^{[n]}\cdots f^{[3]}f^{[2]}$. So, if we choose a fixed point, we can calculate the expected Taylor series around that point. Here's the graph for the Taylor series with 14 terms, calculated with fixed point $-0.6$ You can clearly see the points where the series starts to fail (the radius of convergence doesn't seem to be infinite), but elsewhere the approximation behaves just as we would expect. I computed $(P'(x)-P(P(x)))^2$, where $P$ is the Taylor polynomial, over the range where the series seems to converge, and the total error is on the order of $10^{-10}$. Moreover, this error seems to get smaller the more accurately you compute the derivative (I used $P'(x)\approx\frac{P(x+0.001)-P(x-0.001)}{0.002}$).","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'functional-equations']"

Let $p:Mor(V,W)\rightarrow X$ be defined by $Hom(V_x,W_x)\rightarrow x$ The next step is to define local trivialization
(i.e. we need to define a map from $\phi_i:p^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow U_i\times GL(nm, \mathbb{C})$ such that $proj\circ\phi_i=p$, where $proj: U_i\times GL(nm, \mathbb{C})\rightarrow U_i$ is the projection map) Notice that, $p^{-1}(U_i)=\amalg_{x\in U_i}Hom(V_x,W_x)$ The map $\phi_i:\amalg_{x\in U_i}Hom(V_x,W_x)\rightarrow U_i\times GL(nm, \mathbb{C})$ can be defined as $Hom(V_x,W_x)\rightarrow x\times \text{The matrix correspinding to the map from}$ $V_x$  to  $W_x$. But I have a feeling that the definition of should involve $f_i$ and $g_i$ (the local trivializaions for $V$ and $W$). Also, there is no guarantee that the matrix corresponding to the map form $V_x$ to $W_x$ will be non-singular, and the map I defined will not be well-defined. My main aim is to write down the transition functions for the vector bundle $Mor(V,W)$ But I am stuck far before that in giving a vector bundle structure to $Mor(V,W)=\amalg_{x\in X}Hom(V_x,W_x)$.","['vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1872055,Is minimizing the squared errors optimal?,"In least squares regression, we try to minimize the sum of the squares error terms. I was wondering if this would unfairly penalize a model for having terms that are too far away. For example, a term that is $1$ unit away from the line of best fit would have $1^2=1$ effect on the MSE, but a term that is $2$ units away would have $2^2=4$ effect on the MSE. It seems to me that the term that is 2 units away seems to have 4 times as large an influence on the ""performance"" of a linear model compared with the first term. I was wondering why this was the case, and if there's some intuitive explanation for why this is so. Is the square used because cubics, quartics, etc, are harder to work with? I'd imagine it's easier to optimize for a square than an absolute value. Is there some fundamental reason for why this is so or is it convention? If anybody would have an intuitive explanation, that'd be perfect. Thanks so much!","['regression', 'least-squares', 'mean-square-error', 'machine-learning', 'statistics']"

Thus, $|x^3+5x^2 - 2 - 4|<|x^3+5x^2|<|x^2(x+5)|=x^2|x+5|<x^2|x-1|<\epsilon.$ And we know that $x^2|x-1|<x^2\delta<\epsilon $. As such, for every $\epsilon >0$ the corresponding $\delta$ is $\min\{\epsilon/x^2, \epsilon\}, x\neq0$. Is it right?","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'proof-verification']"

Only thing that comes to my mind is, insert $-1$ and $1$ into the derivated $P'(x)$ but what's the point of doing that anyway...? $$P'(x) = 1-x^2+x^4-x^6+\cdots$$ Very confusing task for me..

1872138,How do I solve equation $\bar{z} = |z|$ correctly?,"I'm having troubles, finding how solution would look like for complex equation of the form $\bar{z} = |z|$. Taking $z = x + iy$, we get the following:
$$x - iy = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$$
then raising it to the 2nd power we get
$$x^2 - 2ixy - y^2 = x^2 + y^2,$$
$$2y^2 = -2ixy.$$
Now, taking complex terms as one equation and real as second, we construct the system of equations:
$$-2xy = 0$$
$$2y^2 = 0$$
Which again yields equation:
$$y^2 + xy = 0.$$
Here we get that $\Im{(z)} = 0$. But what is $\Re{(z)}$ equal to? Is my solution correct?","['algebra-precalculus', 'complex-analysis', 'complex-numbers']"

I want to prove that any affine scheme $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$ is compact. $\bigcup D(f_i)$ is an open cover of $X$ if and only if the sum ideal $\sum (f_i)$ contains $1$. That is, $ D(\sum f_i)=\bigcup D(f_i)$.

1872184,Equivalence of two definitions of proper morphism for separated varieties,"In Hartshorne (and pretty much everywhere else I know) a proper morphism is defined to be A morphism of schemes $f:X\to Y$ is said to be proper if it is sperated , of finite type and universally closed . But then I started reading ""Introduction to Moduli Problems and Orbit Spaces"" by Newstead. He defines a proper morphism between two separated varieties (which he simply calls variety, calling non-seperated varieties prevarieties) quite differently: Let $X,Y$ be (separated) varieties. A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is proper if for any other (separated) variety $Z$, the map $f\times 1: X\times Z\to Y\times Z$ is closed. I can't figure out why these two definitions are equivalent to each other when the Harthsorne definition is restricted separated varieties over $k$.  The finite type in the definition of Hartshorne is clearly redundant when dealing with varieties. Edit : After a few comments, I think I should say what parts of this equivalence is problematic for me to prove (although the comments already helped me resolve parts of the problem/confusion). If $f:X\to Y$ is universally closed, i.e. for all separated $k$-varieties $Z$, the projection map $Z\times_Y X\to Z$ is closed (after base change), then $f\times 1: X\times Z\to Y\times Z$ is closed : Consider the base change of $f:X\to Y$ under the projection map $\pi_Y: Z\times Y\to Y$ with $Z$ arbitrary. One easily check that $X\times Z$ with $\pi_X: X\times Z\to X$ and $f\times 1: X\times Z\to Y\times Z$ satisfies the UMP of fibered product. Then universally closed yields $f\times 1$ is closed. So what remains to prove is If $f\times 1: X\times Z\to Y\times Z$ is closed for all separated $k$-varieties $Z$, then $Z\times_Y X\to Z$ is closed for all $Z$ too . Also I can really get some help on why any morphism of separated $k$-varieties is separated . I think it should be simple and I'm just thinking over-complicated.",['algebraic-geometry']

\exp\left(a\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\right)f(x)\,,

is there also a simple form for this expression? Expanding the exponential only results in the even derivatives of $f(x)$, so I am reasonably sure that this is not equal to something as simple as, for example,  $f(x+a)^2$. I then realized that \begin{align*}
\exp\left(a\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\right)f(x)=\exp\left(a\frac{d}{dx}\right)^{\frac{d}{dx}}f(x)\,,

1872227,Spanning 2-regular subgraphs in even regular graphs.,"Theorem: Every regular graph of positive even degree has a spanning 2-regular subgraph. This was taken from Corollary 5.10 of ETH Zurich's notes on graph theory . The proof constructs a Eulerian tour, splits the vertices into in and out vertices on the tour, then invokes Hall's theorem on the regular (and now bipartite graph) to get a perfect matching. This is joined together to form the spanning 2-regular subgraph. While the proof seems relatively straightforward, I have two questions: First, where is the 2-regular, spanning subgraph in this 4-regular graph ? 
It seems to me that following the theorem it should have one, but I have been unable to identify a 2-regular, spanning subgraph in this relatively simple graph. Second, doesn't this imply that every even degree, connected, regular graph has a Hamiltonian cycle?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
