3375561,Probability law of waiting times,"Yousha takes the train every day from Jangpura, where he lives, to go to his school at INA train station. Jangpura is on the Violet line, while INA is on the yellow line and the interchange is at Lajpat Nagar station.
  The waiting times in Jangpura and Lajpat Nagar are independent random variables following the exponential law with parameter λ.
  Find the probability law of the total waiting time in the two stations. Any help will be appreciated. I have no idea where to take it from!
I thought I was familiar with combinatorics and probabilities but this is completely out of my knowledge base!!",['probability']
3375641,"Prove that for every natural number $n$, there is a set $S$ of $n$ natural numbers such that for any two different numbers $a,b$ From $S$ the number…","Prove that for every natural number $n$ , there is a set $S$ of $n$ natural numbers such that for any two different numbers $a,b$ From $S$ the number $a-b$ divides $a$ and $b$ and no another number from the group S. I tried lots of directions. I've been trying to use the Chinese remainder theorem, Euclid's algorithm and I think I have a direction. I will write it down, but anyways if anyone solves another way I would love to hear his/her solution. I will solve for a case where n = 3 , but the idea is the same idea for any other n. Let's start by taking a multiple of 3 different prime numbers, say, $3,5,7$ . Now let's say $m = 3 * 5 * 7$ . The first number will be $m / 3 = 35$ . The second would be $m / 5 = 21$ . And the third would be $m / 7 = 15$ . Let's take the first and second and execute Euclid's algorithm on them and get their gcd, we will solve for the inverse and get: $7 = 2 * 21-35$ . We will replace the first and second numbers with $35 * 1 = 35$ and $21 * 2 = 42$ . Now let's do the same on the first and third and we get: $5 = 1 * 35-2 * 15$ . We will replace the third with $2 * 15 = 30$ and the first one will remain the same. We will also perform this action on the second and third and we will get $84$ and $90$ .Then, we multiply the last ( $35$ ) by $90/30=3$ and we will be lucky to get ( $105,90,84$ ) three numbers that work. Obviously this method does not work in the general case (when we replace the numbers we also change their difference with others and maybe even make them divisible by other differences) but this method gives direction and intuition to the question.","['number-theory', 'chinese-remainder-theorem', 'modular-arithmetic', 'euclidean-algorithm']"
3375657,Inequality for 0-1-matrices.,Given a $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with entries 0 or 1 and non-zero determinant. Question 1: Is true that the sum of the entries of the inverse of $A$ is less than or equal to $n$ ? Question 2: Is true that the sum of the entries of the inverse of $A$ is less than or equal to $n$ in case $A$ has determinant $\pm 1$ and only the entries 1 on the diagonal? Is in this case the value $n$ uniquely attained by the identity matrix as this sum? Both questions have a positive answer for $n \leq 4$ .

Again if $R$ has an identity and it satisfies the above stated property, then $R$ is either the ""zero ring"" $\{0\}$ , $\mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb Z_n$ under the criterion that every subring of $R$ must contain the identity of $R .$ And, for any group $(R , +)$ , if we define the multiplication operation such that $ab =0$ for all $a, b$ in $R$ , then also the criterion would have been satisfied without the requirement of having an identity .

3375804,"Given $\triangle BPD$ with $O$ the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$, project $P$ to $P'$ and show that $|OB||OP'|$ is independent of $|BD|$.","This recent question (put on-hold for lack of context) presented the following: Original Question. Let $ABCD$ be a square and let $P$ be a point inside it such that $|PD|=29$ and $|PB|=23$ . Find the area of $\triangle APC$ . As @JeanMarie's answer indicates, the answer is (perhaps surprisingly) independent of the size of the square. In general, the prescribed area can be given as $$|\triangle APC| = \frac14\,\left|\,|PB|^2-|PD|^2\,\right| \tag{1}$$ My approach (which I couldn't post because the question was closed) was as follows: Project $P$ to $P'$ on $\overline{BD}$ ; then $\triangle APC$ and $\triangle AP'C$ (which share base $\overline{AC}$ and have congruent corresponding heights) have equal areas, so we just need to find the latter. Of course, that area is (writing $O$ for the center of the square): $$|\triangle AP'C| = \tfrac12 |AC||OP'| = |OA||OP'|=|OB||OP'| \tag{2}$$ With the far-right expression, we find that we can ditch the square context and the goal of computing an area, reformulating the question something like this: Reformulated Question. For $\triangle BPD$ with $O$ the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$ , let $P'$ be the projection of $P$ onto $\overline{BD}$ . Show that $|OB||OP'|$ is independent of $|BD|$ (or, if you prefer, $\angle P$ ). Specifically, taking the target to be a signed product (negative, if $\overrightarrow{OB}$ and $\overrightarrow{OP'}$ are oppositely-directed; positive otherwise) show that the value is given by $$|OB||OP'| = \frac14\left(\;|PD|^2 - |PB|^2\;\right) \tag{3}$$ My answer to the Reformulated Question appears below.

3375808,Proof regarding the minimum of a function,"I want to show that the function $$f(x)= \frac{2x}{1+(\frac{1}{k-x})^a} +  \frac{k-2x}{1+2\cdot(\frac{1}{k-x})^a+ (\frac{1}{k-2x})^a}$$ with $$ x \in [0,\frac{k}{2}], a \in [0,\infty], k \in [0,1] $$ has the minimum $$min(f(x)) = \begin{cases}

I checked that this is in fact the minimum by simulating the function for all permitted parameter values. My initial idea was to use the generalized version of the Binomial theorem 
on the $1/(k-x)^a$ terms, but this only worked for $a\leq2$ because the elements of the series obtained from the theorem are not shrinking in absolute value. Another idea was to show that every critical point of the function is never a global minimum, but I cannot find a solution for $f'(x)=0$ . Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

3375889,Why are there apparently multiple general anti-derivatives for $f(x) = 1/x$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Two different solutions to integral (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . So I've learned that the general anti-derivative of $f(x)=1/x$ is: $\ln|x|+C$ But it is also true, according to Wolfram Alpha, that the derivative of $\ln(2x)$ is also $1/x$ . So what gives? How can these facts both be true? Why isn't $\ln(2x) + C$ also an anti-derivative of $1/x$ ? Is there something about the definition of anti-differentiation that I'm missing? NOTE: I am in high school Calculus, and we have not yet covered integration. That being said, I have some limited familiarity with the notation for indefinite integrals (which I understand to be the same as anti-derivatives?), so as long as you're careful to explain things and use precise language, I suppose I'm fine with using integrals in any answers.","['integration', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

3376025,Example of an additive map $\mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_X$ that is not a differential operator on a Scheme $X$.,"I'm looking for a $S$ -Scheme $X$ (with structural morphism $f$ ) and an additive (or rather $\newcommand{\O}{\mathcal{O}}f^{-1} O_S$ -linear) endomorphism of sheaves $D: \O_X \to O_X$ which is not a differential operator (as defined in EGA IV, chapter 16). A morphism $D: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ for some $\O_X$ -modules $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ that isn't a differential operator would be interesting, too. To my surprise I haven't been able to come up with such a thing. The closest I have got is the isomorphism of sheaves of abelian groups $\O_\mathbb{C} \to \O_\mathbb{C} / \underline{\mathbb{C}}$ given by integration ( $\O_\mathbb{C}$ being the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}$ and $\underline{\mathbb{C}}$ the constant sheaf). However this approach doesn't seem to work for something like $\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{C}$ because differentiation isn't surjective there. A quick definition of differential operators: A map of sheaves ob abelian groups $D: \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_X$ is a differential operators if it factors as $u \circ d^n_{X/S}$ for some $\O_X$ -linear $u$ and some $n$ . $d^n_{X/S}: \O_X \to \mathcal{P}^n_{X/S}$ is the map into the sheaf of principal parts $\mathcal{P}^n$ which in turn is defined as $\Delta_{X/S}^{-1} \O_{X \times_S X} / \mathcal{I}^{n+1}$ , $\mathcal{I}$ being the kernel of $\Delta^{-1}_{X/S} \O_{X \times_S X} \to \O_X$ . The projection $p_1: X \times_S X$ yields a morphism $\O_X \to \Delta^{-1}_{X/S}\O_{X \times_S X}$ with gives $\mathcal{P}^n_{X/S}$ its structure of $\O_X$ -Module. The analogous morphism arising from $p_2$ is $d^n_{X/S}$ . For an more understandable definition, refer to EGA. EDIT: I think it is not implausible to assume that there might no such ""non-differential operator"" (at least not between sheaves $\mathcal{F}$ , $\mathcal{G}$ locally of finite type) on sufficiently nice Schemes: On a real smooth manifold, by peetre's theorem every morphism of sheaves $C^\infty \to C^\infty$ isa differential operator. Also for $\mathcal{F} = \bigoplus_{\mathbb{N}} \O_X$ , $D = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial {x_2}^2} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial {x_3}^3} + \cdots : \mathcal{F} \to \O_X$ is a morphism of sheaves of abelian groups that isn't a differential operator.","['differential-operators', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'examples-counterexamples']"
3376026,Combinatorial proof for $2^n=1+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^k$ [duplicate],This question already has answers here : counting proof for $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^{k} = 2^n - 1$ (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I am looking to find a proof by double counting. Logically concerning the left hand side I was thinking about the number of all subsets of a n-set. On the right hand side following the same logic I see that with the same logic this will translate to summing up the number of subsets of all k-sets for k=0 to n-1 and then adding one more set. This seems a bit counterintuitive as there are a lot of sets that will be counted double. I looked at the building up of the subsets from k to k+1 and tried finding a recurrence relation. I noticed that in fact the number of subsets of a n-set is equal to the amount of the subsets in n=0 to n-1 added together plus 1. But I cant see why this is true. It makes more sense to me that $2^n$ is equal to the sum of all subsets of length $k=0$ to $n-1$ and then adding the set itself so plus 1 and thus having $2^n=1+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}$ . I am quite sure we could get from those binomial coefficients to the $2^k$ that we want to find. But this would not be a double counting proof anymore. Maybe I need to look at the problem in another angle?,"['elementary-set-theory', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorial-proofs']"
3376038,"If $|A|, |B|$ are sufficiently small, does $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ imply that $AB = BA$?","For  complex matrices $A, B$ of the same size, there are simple counterexamples to the question,
""Does $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ imply that $AB = BA$ ?''; but they do not involve matrices that have very small
(Euclidean) norm. See for example, one of the responses to this question , in which $e^{A+B} = e^A = e^B = I$ , where $I$ is the identity matrix, but $A$ and $B$ do not commute. If there are counterexamples with $|A|, |B|$ being arbitrarily small then that settles the question. 
In the alternative, here is the small progress that I have made, in case the following line of reasoning can
be continued to a solution. First, by ""very small'', I mean that the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff (CBH) series expansion is valid
for both $\log(e^A e^B)$ and $\log(e^B e^A)$ . The CBH series expansion for $\log(e^X e^Y)$ is $e^X e^Y = \exp( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} F_m(X, Y) )$ , where $F_m(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial
of degree $m$ in the (generally, non-commuting) variables $X, Y$ (complex matrices of equal size, $n$ , say); 
and $F_m(X, Y)$ contains neither the term $X^m$ nor the term $Y^m$ , except for $m=1$ : $F_1(X, Y) = X + Y$ .
Each $F_m(X, Y)$ is moreover a linear combination of nested Lie brackets of $X$ and $Y$ . Also, we have the
elementary property, $F_m(Y, X) = (-1)^{m+1} F_m(X, Y)$ . Next, it suffices to show that $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ implies that $e^{A+B} = e^B e^A$ , for then $e^B e^A = e^B e^A$ , which does imply that $AB = BA$ , under the assumption that $|A|, |B|$ are sufficiently small.
Indeed, setting $X = e^A$ and $Y = e^B$ , so that $A = \log X$ and $B = \log Y$ , then $AB = BA$ because $\qquad A = (X−I) − \frac{1}{2}(X−I)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(X−I)^3 − \cdots$ , $\qquad B = (Y−I) − \frac{1}{2}(Y−I)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(Y−I)^3 − \cdots$ , and the series commute since $X$ and $Y$ do. The assumed equality, $e^A e^B = e^{A+B}$ , implies that $\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} F_m(A, B) = 0$ ; but $A$ and $B$ are specific matrices, so we can't (immediately) conclude that each $F_m(A, B) = 0$ , for $m \geq 2$ . 
Using the property, $F_m(B, A) = (-1)^{m+1} F_m(A, B)$ , we have $$
 e^B e^A = \exp\left( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{m+1} F_m(A, B) \right) = \exp\left( X + Y + \sum_{m=2}^{\infty} (-1)^{m+1} F_m(A, B) \right).
$$ Based only on the equality, $\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} F_m(A, B) = 0$ , I don't see why $\sum_{m=2}^{\infty} (-1)^{m+1} F_m(A, B)$ should equal $0$ . Another approach might be to consider $e^A e^B e^{-A} e^{-B}$ .","['linear-algebra', 'exponential-function', 'lie-groups']"

The transition functions of $\mathcal{O}(2)$ are given by $$g_{01}: U_0 \cap U_1 \to \mathbb{R}^*, \ \ \ [x,y] \mapsto (y/x)^2;$$ and $$g_{10}: U_1 \cap U_0 \to \mathbb{R}^*, \ \ \ [x,y] \mapsto (x/y)^2.$$ To show $g$ is equivalent to the trivial transition function $1$ , we want to have two nowhere vanishing smooth functions $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ on $U_0$ and $U_1$ , respectively, such that over $U_0 \cap U_1$ , $$g_{01} = \lambda_0 \lambda_1^{-1}, \quad \text{and} \quad g_{10} = \lambda_1 \lambda_0^{-1}.$$ Is there an easy way to cook up such $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ ? If we allow only continuous functions, then we can choose a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(t) = t^2$ when $|t| \geq 1 $ , and $f(t)=1$ when $t<1$ . Then $\lambda_0([x,y])=f(y/x)$ and $\lambda_1([x,y])=f(x/y)$ will work. But I'm not sure how to construct smooth functions $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ to make things work.","['vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

3376396,Tangent and cotangent spaces of varieties over a field,"I've become very confused about the tangent and cotangent spaces of a variety (read: finite type scheme over an algebraically closed field). Most of my problem is that most texts just refer to the vector spaces involved without giving any thought to the fields. Let's say $X, Y$ are varieties over $k$ with $k$ algebraically closed. We have a morphism over $k$ , call it $f: X \rightarrow Y$ with $f(x) = y$ . Note that there are three fields at play here: $k, \kappa(x), \kappa(y) $ . Kappa is my notation for residue fields. There are field extensions $k \hookrightarrow \kappa(y) \hookrightarrow \kappa(x)$ which just comes from the fact that the stalk morphism is a local homomorphism of local rings, right? The tangent spaces are given by $\mathfrak{m}_{x}/\mathfrak{m}_{x}^{2}$ and $\mathfrak{m}_{y}/\mathfrak{m}_{y}^{2}$ . These are vector spaces over $\kappa(x)$ and $\kappa(y)$ respectively. This is where things get murky. Every introduction to algebraic geometry says we have a morphism of cotangent spaces, $$
\mathfrak{m}_{y} / \mathfrak{m}_{y}^{2} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{m}_{x}/\mathfrak{m}_{x}^{2}.
$$ But this is a morphism of what? Of $k$ -vector spaces? Or are we performing a change of fields via a tensor product so that this is a morphism of $\kappa(f(p))$ -vector spaces? The entire machinery of schemes has non-closed points built into it, so I would like to keep these vector spaces as being over the respective residue fields, but then in order to have a morphism between them there has to be a change of fields involved. More confusing still, this is dualized. And the dualizing appear to happen over $k$ , to obtain a morphism of tangent spaces. But then we would need some tensor-hom adjunction to turn them back into vector spaces over the respective residue fields. Is someone able to explain what is going on here, or even just refer to an introductory text that includes the words ""over [field name]"" when they give a morphism of vector spaces?","['vector-spaces', 'field-theory', 'affine-varieties', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

3376550,Axioms for The Integers,"In his 1961 article Successor Axioms for The Integers ( The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 68, No. 5 (May, 1961 ), pp. 441-444) Angelo Margaris proposed the following axioms to define the integers: 2. The axioms. The axioms for the set $Z$ of integers are $Z$ is not empty. To each integer $x$ there is associated a unique integer ${x}'$ (called the successor of $x$ ). For all integers $x$ and $y$ , if ${x}'={y}'$ , then $x=y$ . For each integer $y$ there is an integer $x$ such that ${x}'=y$ . (This $x$ , which is unique by Axiom 3, is called the predecessor of $y$ , and is denoted by ${}^\backprime{y}$ .) If $M$ is a set of integers such that (i) $M$ is not empty ; (ii) for every integer $x$ , $x$ is in $M$ if and only if ${x}'$ is in $M$ ; then $M=Z$ . There is a subset $Q$ of $Z$ such that (i) $Q$ is not empty; (ii) for every integer $x$ , if $x$ is in $Q$ , then ${x}'$ is in $Q$ ; $Q\ne Z$ . Sounds quite reasonable to me.
What I don't understand is this peculiar way to define the set of positive integers $P$ . 4. Order. In this section we show that $Z$ is an ordered ring, and its set of positive elements satisfies the Peano axioms. For the set $Q$ of Axiom 6, there is an $x$ such that ${x}'$ is in $Q$ and $x$ is not in $Q$ . Otherwise, $Q=Z$ by Axiom 5, contradicting Axiom 6.  Let $0$ be such  an $x$ and let $1={0}'$ . The $0$ and $1$ of Section 3 are  now fixed  to  be this $0$ and $1$ . I completely agree with that. If the statement $\exists x\in Z\left( {x}'\in Q\wedge x\notin Q \right)$ was false then $\forall x\in Z\left( {x}'\notin Q\vee x\in Q \right)$ would be true. The statement $\forall x\in Z\left( x\in Q \right)$ implies that $Z\subseteq Q$ - an obvious contradiction. The same can be said about $\forall x\in Z\left( {x}'\notin Q \right)$ . Since each integer $x$ has its predecessor $y$ , no integer can be contained in the set $Q$ , therefore, $Q=\varnothing $ - a contradiction. So far, we've established that there is at least one $x\in Z$ such that ${x}'\in Q\wedge x\notin Q$ . Shouldn't we at first prove that there is precisely one such $x\in Z$ and only then assign the symbol $0$ to it? Let $P$ be the intersection of all sets $M$ such that I. $1$ is in $M$ ; II. For every $x$ , if $x$ is in M, then ${x}'$ is in $M$ ; III. $0$ is not in $M$ . $P$ exists because the set $Q$ of Axiom 6 is such an $M$ . Then $P$ has properties I-III, and is a subset of every set satisfying I-III. Why do we need this intersection in the first place? Isn't just $P=Q$ ?","['number-theory', 'integers']"

What can be observed is that the gradient of $f$ at this point and the gradient of $g$ at this point, are proportional. Hence, we introduce the Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda$ , a constant of proportionality for this relation: $$\nabla f(x_m,y_m) = \lambda \nabla g(x_m,y_m)$$ From this we get a system of equations and solve for the maximum. Now that was fine, and the idea of $\nabla f$ being proportional to $\nabla g$ is easy to see, with thanks to the geometric interpretation. Where I become confused is when we start adding multiple constraints. Multiple Constraints Suppose I have a function $f(x,y,z)=3x-y-3z$ and I'm trying to maximise/minimise this function subject to constraints $g_1(x,y,z)=x+y-1=0$ and $g_2(x,y,z)=x^2+2z^2-1=0$ . Similar to the single constraint case, part of the process of solving this would be to say that, $$\nabla f=\lambda_1\nabla g_1 + \lambda_2 \nabla g_2$$ And indeed, I suppose we could generalise and say that if we had some $m$ constraints, that we'd have to solve $\nabla f= \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i\nabla g_i$ . The Problem However, I am struggling for a geometric interpretation of this relationship between the gradient of $f$ and the gradients of the constraints. Because I'm struggling for a geometric interpretation, I'm struggling to understand what this means at all. Why is the gradient of $f$ a combination of the gradients of the constraints? Does anyone have perspective on this?","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier']"

3377223,Determining Canonical Coin Systems of Five Coins,"I need to check whether a given coin system of five coins, $\$ = <1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5>$ , is canonical , that is, a system in which the greedy algorithm provides the way to make change using the fewest number of coins. For example, the US paper currency system $\$_{US}=<1,5,10,20,50>$ is canonical, but the system $\$_{NC}=<1,3,4,20,50>$ is non-canonical, as, among other values, $6=4+1+1$ would be the greedy representation, but $6=3+3$ is the optimal representation, as it uses one fewer coin. A helpful reference I found is Xuan Cai: Canonical Coin Systems for Change-Making Problems , in which neccesary and sufficient conditions are given for, among others, the case for coin systems with five coins. However, I am getting conflicting results when following these conditions in the paper, likely owing to my own misunderstanding. Here is the relevant theorem: Theorem 9: A coin system $\$=<1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5>$ is non-canonical if
  and only if $\$$ satisfies exactly one of the following conditions: 1) $\$=<1,c_2,c_3>$ is non-canonical. 2) $\$ \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3>$ . 3) $\lvert GRD_{\$}((k+1) \cdot c_4)\rvert > k+1$ with $k \cdot c_4<c_5<(k+1) \cdot c_4$ . The way to check if a coin system with three coins is non-canonical is provided by Theorem 4: Theorem 4: The coin system $=<1,c_2,c_3>$ is non-canonical if and only if $0<r<c_2-q$ where $c_3=qc_2+r$ and $r \in [0, c_2-1]$ . Here are two examples of coin systems checked with Theorem 9. 1) $\$_1=<1,5,10,20,50>$ . First we check $<1,5,10>$ by Theorem 4. We see that $10=2 \cdot 5 + 0$ , giving $r = 0$ , and $q = 2$ . Thus $0 \nless r$ , so $<1,5,10>$ is canonical , and so $\$_1$ does not meet the first condition. Next, we check that $\$_1 \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3> = <1,2,10,11,20>$ , which is true. Thus, $\$_1$ does meet the second condition. Finally, we check the third condition. We find $k=2$ satisfies $2 \cdot 20 < 50 < 3 \cdot 20$ , and so we find $GRD_{\$_1}(3 \cdot 20 = 60) = 50+10$ . Thus, $\lvert GRD_{\$_1}(60)\rvert = 2$ , as two coins are used. Thus $2 \ngtr 3$ , and so $\$_1$ does not meet the third condition. In conclusion, $\$_1$ meets exactly one of the three conditions, condition 2), and so, by Theorem 9, $\$_1$ is non-canonical . However, we know this is not true, as $\$_1 = \$_{US}$ from above, a system known to be canonical. 2) $\$_2=<1,3,4,20,50>$ . First we check $<1,3,4>$ by Theorem 4. We see that $4=1 \cdot 3 + 1$ , giving $r = 1$ , and $q = 1$ . Thus $0 < r < 2$ , so $<1,3,4>$ is non-canonical , and so $\$_2$ does meet the first condition. Next, we check that $\$_2 \ne <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3> = <1,2,4,5,8>$ , which is true. Thus, $\$_2$ does meet the second condition. Finally, we check the third condition. We find $k=2$ satisfies $2 \cdot 20 < 50 < 3 \cdot 20$ , and so we find $GRD_{\$_1}(3 \cdot 20 = 60) = 50+4+4+1+1$ . Thus, $\lvert GRD_{\$_1}(60)\rvert = 5$ , as five coins are used. Thus $5 > 3$ , and so $\$_2$ does meet the third condition. In conclusion, $\$_2$ meets not exactly one but all three conditions, and so, by Theorem 9, $\$_2$ is canonical . However, we know this is not true, as $\$_2 = \$_{NC}$ from above, a system known to be non-canonical. Either I am misinterpreting Theorem 9, or a (likely) small correction should be made in the paper. Can anyone see either where I am wrong, or how Theorem 9 should be fixed? My hunch is that the second condition should read $\$ = <1,2,c_3,c_3+1,2c_3>$ , and the wording of Theorem 9 should be ""...is non-canonical if and only if $\$$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions"". That way, our two examples would be consistent with their known canonicality.","['combinatorics', 'integer-programming', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"

How many ways are there to arrange those $7$ variables given that $x$ and $y$ cannot be together? Ex: $zxzxzyy$ and $xxzzzyy$ are valid while $zyxzyzx$ and $xyzzyxz$ are not. I tried approaching this problem by finding the total number of ways of arranging the $7$ variables (without any restrictions) which was $\frac{7!}{{3!}\cdot{2}\cdot{2}}$ which is ${7}\cdot{6}\cdot{5}$ , or $210$ . Then I could subtract the number of impossible combinations, and I did that by grouping one $x$ and one $y$ together to make a O. Then I just calculated the number of ways to arrange O, one $x$ , one $y$ , and three $z$ 's. That was $\frac{6!}{3!}$ , which is $120$ . Then I multiplied the product by $2$ because O could either be $xy$ or $yx$ to get $240$ total combinations. Since $240$ is greater than $210$ , I knew at once that I had over counted. To account for the over counting, I tried to use P.I.E. But at this point I had totally confused myself and now I have no idea what's the right path to take.

Prove that $S=m^*(E)$ if and only if $E$ is measurable. I have not found any help here or on other websites for my specific inquiries. We are not working with compact sets so any answer using that also doesn't help me understand. My main issue, I think, is how am I supposed to express this in a formal proof? My understanding of the question is: $S$ is the largest that $m(F)$ can be, where $F$ is still closed and a subset of $E$ . Since closed sets are measurable, $F$ is already always measurable (hence the $m(F)$ not $m^*(F$ )). $\color{red}{\Leftarrow}$ If $E$ is measurable, then by definition, we're taking the supremum of the inner approximation of $E$ , hence it is equal to the $m^*(E)$ . ( Theorem : Let $E \in M$ , $m(E) < \infty$ . Then $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists F,$ a closed set, s.t. (1) $F\subset E$ and (2) $0 \leq m(E/F) < \epsilon$ .) $M$ is the set of all measurable sets. Also, we know that $E$ cannot be infinite, since $E\subset [0,1]$ . The only issue I have with my proof here is that the theorem says that $F$ is existing based on the $\epsilon$ , and here I think we're give a fixed set $F$ . But then I also feel like it says $S$ contains any $F$ I want it to. So am I allowed to still used my (non-formally worded) proof? $\color{red}{\Rightarrow}$ If $S=m^*(E)$ , then it follows immediately that $E \in M$ . This is because this means $m^*(E)=\sup\{m(F)\mid F\text{ is closed}, F\subset E\}$ , in other words, the measure of $E$ is the measure of the largest subset of $E$ that's closed, and that closed subset is already measurable. So the measure of $E$ is equal to the measure of a measurable set. Am I super off-base with my answers? Or are these valid, they just need a more refined proof?

Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a finite type morphism of noetherian schemes. My working definition for $f$ smooth at a point $x \in X$ with $y = f(x)$ is as follows: 1) $f$ is flat at $x$ ; 2) $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $d$ equal to the krull dimension of $\mathcal{O}_{X, x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{Y, y}} \kappa(y)$ . To be more specific say this is smooth of relative dimension $d$ . Then I say $f$ is smooth if it is smooth at $x$ for all $x \in X$ . This seems to agree with most sources I have seen. But in Hartshorne, smoothness is defined for morphisms of finite type $k$ -schemes (at a point $x$ ) as follows: 1) $f$ is flat at $x$ ; 2) The fiber of $\Omega_{X/Y}$ at $x$ has dimension $d$ , that is, $\dim_{\kappa(x)}(\Omega_{X/Y, x} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{X, x}} \kappa(x)) = d$ . But this latter definition doesn't seem to say anything whatsoever about $\Omega_{X/Y}$ being locally free. The only thing we seem to be able to conclude from Hartshorne's definition is that, by Nakayama, $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is generated by $d$ sections in a neighbourhood of $x$ . But that doesn't at all imply that it is free in a neighbourhood of $x$ . I have heard some people claim that Hartshorne's definition is less general. But this seems to be showing the exact opposite: Hartshorne's definition seems far more general because it doesn't even require the sheaf of differentials to be locally free. Indeed Hartshorne seems to infer that being integral is required for his definition to yield local freeness. So what am I missing here? Does the stalk of the sheaf of differentials have to be free at $x$ in order for a morphism to be smooth at $x$ ?

3377939,Intuition behind defining the information of a random variable as being additive for independent events,"I'm recently studying the concepts of entropy and I've a fundamental question regarding the conceptual formulation of information content of a random variable $X$ , or equivalently, the uncertaintly of a system/probabilistic experiments with $n$ possible outcomes. In either cases, I'm trying to understand why the information content, or, the uncertainty has to be an additive function in the formulation process itself? Of course, $f(p) :=k log p$ satisfies the $f(pq)= f(p) + f(q)$ . But my question is before defining the information content or uncertaintly as a log function. More precisely: (1) Information content ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) ): Consider a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ where the three notations in the parentheses denote respectiveky the sample space, a sigma algebra of $P$ -measurable sets (""events""), and $P$ is the probability measure on $\Omega$ . Now, we don't quite need a random variable to formulate the information content $I$ , i.e. $I$ is just a function defined on the ""events"", $I : \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]$ , so that: (1) $I(\Omega)=0$ (This is intutively clear, as the full event doesn't bring us any information), (2) $I(A) \leq I(B)$ if $P(A) \geq P(B)$ (intuitively clear, as rarer events are more informative), and (3) $I(AB)=I(A) + I(B)$ , where $A,B$ are independent. Now, this is the part I fail to have an intuition: why is it assumed that $I(AB)=I(A) + I(B)$ , where $A,B$ are independent? Let's try to examine some counter examples here. If we'd have assumed $I(AB)=I(A)I(B)$ , where $A,B$ are independent, then it'd not necessaily satisfy (2), as there're events $A,B$ with one of $I(A), I(B)$ is less than $1$ , and then $I(A) \leq I(AB) = I(A)I(B) > I(A)$ , contradintion. So this doesn't work. What if, we'd have defined $I(AB) = I(A) + I(B) + \phi(I(A), I(B))$ , where $\phi(.,.)$ satisfies: i) $\phi(p, 1) = 0 \forall p, \phi(1, q)=0 \forall q, ii) \phi(p,q) = \phi(q, p) \forall p, q $ . What'd be the problem if the information content were defined like this? I understand the last definition looks unnecessarily complicated, so perhaps counterintuitive, and also, perhaps Shannon was inspired by the idea of entropy in thermodynamics, but still I wonder!","['statistics', 'information-geometry', 'information-theory', 'statistical-mechanics', 'fisher-information']"
3377987,Is every solution of this matrix equation diagonal?,"Let $A$ be a real $n \times n$ matrix with positive determinant. Suppose that $A$ is diagonal , and that $ A=S-\lambda (S^T)^{-1}$ , where $S$ is another invertible real $n \times n$ matrix, and $\lambda$ is some real number. Must $S$ be diagonal? Edit: It suffices to prove that $S$ is symmetric, at least in the generic case where $A$ has distinct diagonal entries. Indeed, the assumption is equivalent to $S^T(S-A)=\lambda I$ , hence $$S^T(S-A)=\lambda I=(\lambda I)^T=(S^T(S-A))^T=(S^T-A^T)S,$$ i.e. $ S^TA=A^TS$ . Since $A$ is symmetric, we obtain $ S^TA=AS$ .

3377988,What is the next number on the constructibility sequence? And what is the asymptotic growth?,"Let us systematically generate all constructible points in the plane. We begin with just two points, which specify the unit distance. With the straightedge, we may construct the line joining them. And with the compass, we may construct the two circles centered at each of them, having that unit segment as radius. These circles intersect each other and the line, creating four additional points of intersection. Thus, we have now six points in all. Using these six points, we proceed to the next stage, constructing all possible lines and circles using those six points, and finding the resulting points of intersection. I believe that we now have 203 points. Let us proceed in this way to systematically construct all constructible points in the plane, in a hierarchy of finite stages. At each stage, we form all possible lines and circles that may be formed from our current points using straightedge and compass, and then we find all points of intersection from the resulting figures. This produces what I call the constructibility sequence : $$2\qquad\qquad 6\qquad\qquad 203\qquad\qquad ?$$ Each entry is the number of points constructed at that stage. I have a number of questions about the constructibility sequence: Question 1. What is the next constructibility number? There is no entry in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences beginning 2, 6, 203, and so I would like to create an entry for the constructibility sequence. But they request at least four numbers, and so we seem to need to know the next number. I'm not sure exactly how to proceed with this, since if one proceeds computationally, then one will inevitably have to decide if two very-close points count as identical are not, and I don't see any principled way to ensure that this is done correctly. So it seems that one will need to proceed with some kind of idealized geometric calculus, which gets the right answer about coincidence of intersection points. [ Update: The sequence now exists as A333944 .] Question 2. What kind of asymptotic upper bounds can you prove on the growth of the constructibility sequence? At each stage, every pair of points determine a line and two circles. And every intersection point is realized as the intersection of two lines, two circles or a line and circle, which have at most two intersection points in each case. So a rough upper bound is that from $k$ points, we produce no more than $3k^2$ many lines and circles, and so at most $(3k^2)^2$ many pairs of line and circles, and so at most $2(3k^2)^2$ many points of intersection. This leads to an upper bound of growth something like $18^n2^{4^n}$ after $n$ stages. Can anyone give a better bound? Question 3. And what of lower bounds? I suspect that the sequence grows very quickly, probably doubly exponentially. But to prove this, we would seem to need to identify a realm of construction patterns where there is little interference of intersection coincidence, so that one can be sure of a certain known growth in new points.","['combinatorics', 'geometry', 'geometric-construction']"

My goal is to demonstrate that I have actually understood something , rather than just recite theorems from Hartshorne and Atiyah-Macdonald.

For $p \in P$ , I'm interested in considering sums of the form $$S_{p,N} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{p(j)}$$ $$\textbf{Question 1: Size}$$ If we assume the coefficients are nonnegative (with the leading coefficient positive), it's easy to deduce an absolute upper bound of $2$ , by comparing with $\sum n^{-2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ . However, we allow negative coefficients, in which case it's not as clear if there is such a simple upper bound (at least not to me). What is $\sup\{S_{p,N}: (p,N) \in P \times \mathbb{N}\}$ ? Further, for a fixed degree $d \geq 2$ , what is $\sup\{S_{p,N}: (p,N) \in P \times \mathbb{N} \ \text{and} \ \text{deg}(p) = d\}$ ? I've tried Lagrange interpolation style arguments to prove that the former is $\infty$ , but have not quite been able to make it work. $$\textbf{Question 2: Integrality}$$ For a given $p$ , at most how many $N$ exist such that $S_{p,N}$ is an integer? Since $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p(j)}$ converges and $p$ nonconstant, it's easy to see that there can only be finitely many such $N$ .","['number-theory', 'real-analysis']"
3378778,Proof for a infinite series representation of $\tan(x)$?,"I was messing around on Desmos (the online graphing calculator) the other day and accidentally created the following. $\hskip{2.5in}$ This graph looks very similar to $\tan(x)$ , which lead me to conjecture that $$\tan(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{-1}{x+\pi n + \frac{\pi}{2}}.$$ I went online searching for a proof and found nothing useful (mostly Taylor and Maclaurin series representations). Additionally, my personal attempts have been abysmal. Hence why I post this and request a proof. A reference to a proof would also be great, but I would still prefer it shown here.","['periodic-functions', 'reference-request', 'sequences-and-series']"
