For example, consider $a=0 ,b=1$ , $f(x)=\frac{1}{2(x+1)}$ . Option $C$ is true. $f(x)=x$ with $a=0,b=1$ . Option $B$ cannot be true, Since: $f^{-1}((a,b))=[a,b]$ and by the property of continuous functions, $f^{-1}((a,b))$ must be an open set. But $[a,b]$ is closed. Option $D$ cannot be true since $f^{-1}([a,b])=(a,b)$ must be a closed set. But $(a,b)$ is open. But, in the answer key, $D$ is given as a correct choice. What am I doing wrong here?

3554319,"If adding ONLY finitely many points to a (non-empty) subset of plane, $\mathbb{R}^2$ makes it closed, then is the closure all of $\mathbb{R}^2$?","Question: Let $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be non-empty open set such that $E$ 's union with finitely many points becomes a closed set. Is it necessarily true that $$
\text{closure}{\ (E)} = \mathbb{R}^2 \, \, ?
$$ Equivalent Question: Looking into its complement you can rephrase it as: Given $F \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ closed, such that $F$ minus a finite set is a non-empty open set, does it follow that $ F = \mathbb{R}^2$ ? Answer and Update: As shown by different correct answers below, yes, the closure of the set has to be all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Also the proofs (at least many of them) illustrate the possibility of generalizing to the countable case, i.e. Lemma: If an open set has only countably many boundary points, then its closure is all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Proof: Proof 1 (@Danielwainfleet's comment) Let $E$ be an open set whose complement is not all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Pick a point in the complement of its closure which is a non-empty open set and consider an open ball around it that is contained in the complement. From its center every ray picks up a boundary point of $E$ , and no two rays pick the same point, as the boundary point is not that center itself. This is where we use openness of the complement is used. This tells us that $E$ has uncountably many boundary points -- for the uncountably many rays. (Other proofs do this with a line segment and that too will produce uncountably many boundary points.) Proof 2: (Lee Mosher) Their proof below works if you replace the finite $A$ with the ""countable"" $A$ -- it is true that $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus A$ is still path connected if $A$ is a countable set.",['general-topology']

3554346,"In the epsilon-delta definition, what is wrong if I said: ""given delta, there exists an epsilon""?","WHY are we always given $\epsilon > 0$ first, then solving for a $\delta>0$ ? This is in the limit definition. I want to ask: Can we say ""given $\delta>0$ , there exists $\epsilon>0$ ""? Since we can always solve for one given the other. I found three counterexamples, but I don't understand them: Let $f(x) = \sin x$ , let $L$ and $\delta$ be arbitrary real numbers.  Then $\epsilon = |L| + 2$ satisfies your definition. (from post ) Q: What's wrong with setting $\epsilon = |L| + 2$ ? It's big, but it's not wrong! Let $f(x) = 1/x$ , and let $a = 1$ .  The definition fails for $\delta \ge 1$ , since for any $\epsilon$ we can choose $x=1/(L+\epsilon)$ if $L+\epsilon > 1$ , so that $f(x)-L \ge \epsilon$ . (from post ) Q: What are they saying here? At $x=1$ , the definition fails for $\epsilon \ge 1$ too! The problem is not $\delta$ . The problem is the function is undefined for $x \le 0$ . Counterexample: $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} f(x) = L$ $f(x) = \begin{cases} \sin \frac{1}{x}, & x \ne 0 \\ 0, & x = 0 \end{cases}$ Given any $\delta > 0$ , we can  find $\epsilon > 0$ such that $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x| < \delta$ .  For instance, set $\epsilon = 2$ ; then any choice of $L \in (-1,1)$ will satisfy this ""reversed"" situation. (from post ) Q: I don't see how setting $\epsilon = 2$ violates any definition. I mean, we did find a $\epsilon$ for a given $\delta$ . Thanks all for the pouring answers, I'll get back to each one personally. If I did not choose an answer, that means all submissions are still welcomed!

3554349,How to efficiently compute the minimal polynomial of a number expressed in radicals?,"Preamble: I want to calculate the minimal polynomial of a number of the form $$x=\sum_{i=1}^k \pm a_i^{1/k_i}$$ Where the $a_i$ are algebraic numbers also of this form with a finite expression and $k_i$ are positive integers. I can think of three approaches, all with serious problems: Using the resultant repeatedly: Apply the algorithm recursively until you arrive at a root of a rational number, therefore we can assume that we have the minimal polynomial of all $a_i$ . Then compute the minimal polynomial of $\pm a_1^{1/k_1}\pm a_2^{1/k_2}$ using the resultant of their minimal polynomials then repeat for that with $a_3, a_4...a_k$ . Let $d_i$ be the degree of the minimal polynomial of $a_i^{1/k_i}$ . In general this method requires computing the determinant of square matrices of orders $d_1+d_2$ , $d_1+d_2+d_3,\ldots$ up to $d_1+d_2+\ldots+d_k$ . According to wikipedia calculating the determinant of a matrix of order $n$ has complexity of the order $O(n^{2.373})$ but practically it's faster to use the LU decomposition method (this is what, for example, the blaze c++ library does) which has a complexity of $O(n^3)$ . If we have $d_1=d_2=...=d$ then the complexity is $O((2d)^3+(3d)^3...(kd)^3)=O(d^3k^4)$ . Using an Integer relation algorithm: If we know that the degree of $x$ is $n$ then we can run for example the LLL algorithm on ${1,x,x^2...x^n}$ . Problems with that include: Determination of $n$ : in the previous example we can get an upper bound of $d^k$ (yikes) so running the LLL algorithm on this would have complexity $O(d^k)$ assuming I'm interpreting wikipedia correctly. If $n$ does not match an upper bound then we either need to run the algorithm again or factor the polynomial. Precision: if we calculate these values outwards starting at the rational constants (for example $\sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{2}}\approx\sqrt[3]{0.5858}\approx 0.8367$ ) we run into the problem that each operation has a tendency to exacerbate the errors of the previous ones. This is particularly problematic when subtracting two large numbers whose difference is small. So we'd need bounds on the error $x^i\pm\epsilon$ where the algorithm still returns the correct result. Edit: since writing this, I found this blog post by Jack Coughlin which details how to estimate this error. This greatly mitigates the problem. Afterwards we'd need to check if the polynomial found really has $x$ as a root and whether it's irreducible (this is only necessary if we don't know $n$ in advance, then we'd have to use an upper bound). Trying some symbolic manipulation, especially as a middle step of another algorithm: In some cases isolating the term with the highest root might be helpful. For example $$x=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt[3]{b}$$ $$x^3-3\sqrt a x^2+3ax-a\sqrt a = b$$ $$(x^3+3ax-b)^2=9ax^4-6a^2x^2+a^3$$ I get the impression that this isn't efficient, so maybe we can use a lookup table for small exponents with little nesting. Applications Of course I want to implement this in a computer so it does all the number crunching for me. For example, recently I was trying to do a search over graphs composed of triangular lattices so what I did is set the vertices of the graph as points in $\mathbb C$ so I had to check whether several numbers of the form $\eta(a+b\omega)+\mu$ where $w=\frac{1-\sqrt{-3}}2$ are equal to each other with sympy but since it stores expressions ""as is"" there's no trivial way to check equality, so I needed to check if the minimal polynomial of $\eta_1(a_1+b_1\omega)+\mu_1-\eta_2(a_2+b_2\omega)-\mu_2$ was equal to the identity polynomial, which takes forever . Sympy uses the first algorithm by default and alternatively something involving Gröbner bases which I did not understand. Of course the object-oriented-programming approach to solving this problem is declaring a class which represents an algebraically closed structure that holds all the numbers you're gonna need (and you better foresee all of them!). For example in c++: // a member of a real or imaginary quadratic field
// a+b*sqrt(n) where a,b,n are integers
class quadratic_int {
  int a;
  int b;
  int n; 
  quadratic_int operator+(quadratic_int p) const {
    // implement addition
  }
  // ...
}; This will be fast to perform operations on, but if you have a number which is not of the form $a+b\sqrt n$ you need to rewrite everything from scratch, plus if $n\equiv 1 \pmod 4$ , $a$ and $b$ need to be half integers, and if you wanted to perform operations on the field $\mathbb Q[\sqrt 2]$ instead the class should probably use a template type instead of ints...all of this complexity means that by the end the class will be over a hundred lines long. If we could compute minimal polynomials fast though, we could have a class called algebraic which internally represents a number as its minimal polynomial together with a way of distinguishing it from the other roots. Then its usage could be something like: algebraic a {""x^2-2"", 0}; // the 0th root of x^2-2 i.e. sqrt(2)
algebraic b {""x^3-3"", 0}; // in 3^(1/3)

// x = 2^(1/2)+3^(1/3)
// so x is an algebraic number of degree 6
// the internal representation of x holds the polynomial
// t^6-6t^4-6t^3+12t^2-36t+1
// as a list of 7 integers (1,0,-6,-6,12,-36,1) plus the number of the root
// which is an integer from 0 to 5
auto x = a + b; Where the 0th, 1st, etc roots are ordered say by absolute value and then by complex argument. This way we still get fast arithmetic without having to rewrite our class every time we need to work on a different algebraic structure. Statement of the question: What is the fastest algorithm to calculate the minimal polynomial of a number expressed in radicals? It should have good asymptotic complexity in the number of terms/the degree of the input. Performance for small entries is not so important because a look-up table can be implemented.","['computational-mathematics', 'minimal-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'computer-algebra-systems', 'numerical-methods']"
3554357,Infinite monkey theorem independent of number of monkeys,"I was just thinking about the infinite monkey theorem and arrived at a creepy conclussion. Let's begin with the probability that one monkey types a set of $N$ letters with a chosen order, which is given by $P = \left( \frac{1}{N_k} \right)^N$ , being $N_k$ the number of keys available in a hypotetical typewriter (for example, the probability of a monkey typing ""MAMA"" in a 26-key typewriter would be $P = \left( \frac{1}{26} \right)^4 \simeq 2\times 10^{-6}$ ). If we have $N_m$ monkeys typewriting, we could think that each monkey $i$ would be required to type only a fraction $N_i = N/N_m$ of the $N$ ordered letters, so that we could arrange later the $N_m$ fractions and create the $N$ -letters original sequence. The total probability of every monkey achieving its task is given by the product of each monkey's probability, $P =  \left( \left( \frac{1}{N_k} \right)^{N_i} \right) ^{N_m} =  \left( \frac{1}{N_k} \right)^N$ , which is independent of $N_m$ .

During preparation, I mused over the following idea and got confused. Firstly, sorry for being too verbose, and Secondly, I know my question is naive in nature. Moving from Relations to Functions, I wondered that why we required a concept of function, if we already have concept of relations. Why we require a specific type of relation in which for every single element of domain there should be a single element in co-domain? i.e. why can't co-domain have two values for single value in domain. Why we define all mathematical expressions (equations) in terms of functions? Why we require to study a specific type of relation called function? I know 'how' of the question i.e. How we can move from relation to function? But, I am confusion over the philosophy or mathematical requirement over the idea of Functions. Hence , I can't figure out 'why' of the question i.e. Why we require to move from relation to function to study Mathematical Function? Final words, we study a specific relation which fulfills surjection, injection, and bi-jection, but strictly can't have two distinct values of domain having same value in co-domain.

3554780,When $\phi_{\mathcal L}=0$ for $\mathcal L$ a line bundle over an abelian scheme $X/S$,"Let $X\rightarrow S$ be a projective abelian scheme. To a line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X$ , we associate its Mumford line bundle $\Lambda(\mathcal L):= \mu^{\star}\mathcal L\otimes p_1^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}\otimes p_2^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}$ on $X\times_S X$ where $\mu$ is the group law, and $p_i$ the projection morphisms. This defines a homomorphism $\phi_{\mathcal L}:X\rightarrow \hat{X}$ of $X$ into its dual. Eventually, denote by $\mathcal P$ the Poincaré sheaf on $X\times_S \hat{X}$ trivialized along $\epsilon\times id$ , where $\epsilon$ is the unit section of $X$ . Claim: Assume that $\mathcal L\cong (id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P$ for some section $\hat{x}:S\rightarrow \hat{X}$ . Then $\phi_{\mathcal L}=0$ . The hypothesis $\mathcal L\cong (id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P$ means that the $S$ -point of $\mathcal{Pic}_{X/S}$ defined by the line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X=X\times_S S$ factors through $\hat{X}$ , and it is exactly $\hat{x}$ . The paper I am reading (Genestier and Ngô's lecture on Shimura varieties) gives as a justification that the statement is trivial for $\mathcal L\cong \mathcal O_X$ , and that we can continously deform a general $\mathcal L$ to $\mathcal O_X$ using rigidity lemma to obtain the desired result. I have trouble writing down a rigorous proof for this. Given an $S$ -scheme $T$ and a $T$ -valued point $z$ of $X$ , at the level of points, $\phi_{\mathcal L}(z)$ is the element of $Pic_{X/S}(T)$ determined by the pullbak of $\Lambda(\mathcal L)$ by $id\times z$ . I must somehow prove that this pullback on $X\times_S T$ is actually the pullback of some line bundle on $T$ . It would be true if I could prove that $\Lambda(\mathcal L)$ is the pullback by $p_2$ of some line bundle on $X$ . Thus I am looking at $\mu^{\star}\mathcal L\otimes p_1^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}\cong \mu^{\star}(id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P\otimes p_1^{\star}(id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P^{-1}$ . I naturally considered the morphism $(id\times\hat{x})\mu - (id\times\hat{x})p_1: X\times_S X\rightarrow X\times_S \hat{X}$ , which we can look as a map between two abelian schemes over $X$ (with structure morphisms the second projection at the start, the first projection at the target). This map sends the unit section on the unit section, hence by rigidity it is a group homomorphism. But I am stuck there, I do not see how to progress further. Would somebody be able to give a hand there ? Edit : I actually just noticed that my last argument is not true, the map $(id\times\hat{x})\mu - (id\times\hat{x})p_1$ isn't sending the unit to the unit after all.

Since the function $\ f(x)$ is not specified, I assume the above statement is true only when it is true for all such functions $\ f(x)$ which satisfy the condition mentioned in the question.

3554891,Extending the Law of Cosines formula to quadrilaterals (and even polygon?),"Let's take a look back at this familiar ""Law of cosines"": ‎Consider‎ the ‎triangle ‎ $\triangle‎‎ ABC$ . Let $a = BC, b = AC, c = AB$ ; $\angle A, \angle B, \angle C$ are the angles of the triangle opposite to side $a, b, c,$ respectively. By the Law of Cosines: $$a^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle A$$ This formula can apply for any triangle. But what about quadrilaterals? Is there a formula, which shows the relationship between sides and angles, similar to the Law of Cosines? Can we extend the Law of Cosines??? This is the way to approach the formula for quadrilaterals ( It's not (really) a proof ): Given the quadrilateral ABCD. Let $a = BC, b = CD, c = AB, d = AD$ . Let $E = AB \cap CD$ and $G = AC \cap BD$ Let consider $\triangle ABC$ as a ""special quadrilateral"" (where $d=0$ ). Then by the Law of Cosines: $$a^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle BEC = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2bc \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ (because when $d=0$ , $E \equiv G \equiv A \Rightarrow \angle BEC = \angle BGC$ ) Notice that when $d=0$ then $CA = CD = CE = b$ ; $BD = BE = BA = c$ . So we can guess the general formula for a quadrilateral will be one of these two formulas: $$ a^{2‎} + Kd^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BE \cdot CE \cdot \cos \angle BEC \text{ (1)}$$ $$ a^{2‎} + Kd^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC \text{ (2)}$$ (where $K$ is a constant) The reason we add $Kd^{2‎}$ is to make the formula homogeneous (since the Law of Cosines is also homogeneous), and when $d=0$ , the $Kd^{2‎}$ term is gone. Moreover, from our intuition, if the formula contains $\angle BEC$ , then two sides, which multiply to its cosines, have to be $BE$ and $CE$ . Otherwise, those two sides will be $BD$ and $CA$ multiplied by $\cos \angle BGC$ To see which one is possibly correct, we can try to apply the formula to a special quadrilateral: square. In a square, $a=b=c=d$ , "" $BE = CE = \infty$ "", "" $\angle BEC = \infty$ "", $\angle BGC = 90^{\circ}$ . Apply $(1)$ and $(2)$ : $$(1): a^{2‎} + Ka^{2‎} = a^{2‎} + a^{2‎} - \infty$$ $$(2): a^{2‎} + Ka^{2‎} = a^{2‎} + a^{2‎}$$ $(1)$ is definitely wrong. The formula $(2)$ can be true if $K=1$ , so let re-written it: $$a^{2‎} + d^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ To be sure that this formula is correct, let's apply this in another quadrilateral. This time is a rectangle, where $\angle BGC = 60^{\circ}$ . We have $a=d, b=c=a\sqrt{3}$ , $BD = AC = 2a$ . Apply the formula that we've just found, we get: $$a^{2‎} + a^{2‎} = 3a^{2‎} + 3a^{2‎} - 2 \cdot 4a^{2‎} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$ And this is true. You can verify it with some other quadrilaterals, and it'll also true. So, our new extended ""Law of Cosines"" is: $$a^{2‎} + d^{2‎} = b^{2‎} + c^{2‎} - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CA \cdot \cos \angle BGC$$ So that seems fine. But Is there a proof of the formula above ? Now, my main question (and my main focus) is: Can we extend the formula (find a general formula) for polygons with n sides ? This question is what I'm looking for ( This isn't a homework question ). I'm really curious about this. If you have an answer (or just an idea) to approach, please provide it.

How can I proof whether u is differentiable? I think I have to show that $\partial_x u=:u_x$ and $\partial_t u=:u_t$ exist and are continuous. But I have no concrete idea how to prove that. I think one maybe should use that we also have $$
u(x,t)=\int_0^t\int_\mathbb{R}G(y,s)f(u(x-y,t-s))\, dy\, ds\tag{2}
$$ and then (I hope its correct): $$
u_x(x,t)=\int_0^t\int_\mathbb{R}G(y,s)\frac{d}{dx}f(u(x-y,t-s))\, dy\, ds,

$$ Can I use this to show existence and continuity of both partial derivatives? I think the problem is that I do not have information about the terms $\frac{d}{dx}f(u(x-y,t-s))$ and $\frac{d}{dt}f(u(x-y,t-s))$ . But am I in general right that the crucial point for the existence of $u_t$ and $u_x$ is to show that all these integrals are finite, i.e. the integrands are integrable functions? Edit : Maybe I shouldn't use (2) but stick to (1)? Then, I get $$
u_x(x,y)=\int_0^t\int_\mathbb{R}G_x(x-y,t-s)f(u(y,s))\, ds
$$ I think this is a finite integral since $f$ is bounded and the heat kernel is infinitely differentiable and also integrable (again: does this imply the existence of $u_x(x,y)$ ?). Moreoever, using (1), $$
u_t(x,t)=\int_0^t\int_\mathbb{R}G_t(x-y,t-s)f(u(y,s))\, dy\, ds+\int_\mathbb{R}G(x-y,0)f(u(y,t))\, dy.

3555018,Approaches for the study of rings,"When, as a student in my first weeks, I first read the definition of a group, the concept of groups looked very natural and motivated to me. But when I read the definition of a ring some time later, I had no idea what rings should be about and how they were motivated. Especially the distributive property let me wonder how much of the multiplicative structure is already determined by the addition. All of this is has been two years ago. When I recently started to read Algebra: Chapter $\it 0$ by Paolo Aluffi, a lot of thinks I had not understood before, became clear to me. Mostly because of the use of categorical language which really works well with the way I think about mathematics. I even came to peace with the concept of rings, when Aluffi explained them as coming up in the context of studying the homsets of abelian groups (we take the group operation as addition and the composition as multiplication). I have been very happy about this explanation, but then, instead of studying ring by using this approach, Aluffi used the 'classical' definition of rings again. My question is: Why? Is it not much more promising to study rings by studying the homsets of abelian groups? I know that there is not any loose of information by just using the classical definition, but using the definition via homsets looks a lot more natural to me. I know some category theory (at least I read Emily Rhiels book Category Theory in Context ) so I could read I bit trough nLab and soon found out that a ring is equivalent to a preadditive category with only one object (encapturing pretty much what I called 'homset definiton'). So why don't we study thous preadditive categories instead? They seem to have far more 'visible structure' then rings have in their usual definition. (I know that this is kind of a soft question. I do not look in particular for a kind of 'rigorous answer', but rather for your personal view towards this.)","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'soft-question', 'category-theory']"

3555072,Decomposition of the Riemann curvature operator in $4$ dimensions,"Let $(M,g)$ be a $4$ -dimensional Riemannian manifold. The Riemann curvature tensor can be viewed as an operator $\mathcal{R}:\Lambda^2(T^{\star}M)\longrightarrow \Lambda^2(T^{\star}M)$ defined in this way (I'm using Einstein's notation): $$(\mathcal{R}(\omega))_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}R_{klij}\omega_{kl}$$ where $\omega_{ij}$ are the components of the $2$ -form $\omega$ with respect to an orthonormal basis $\{e^i \wedge e^j\}_{i,j=1,..,4}$ and $R_{ijkt}$ are the components of the Riemann curvature tensor. Because of the splitting $\Lambda^2 (T^{\star}M)=\Lambda_{+}\oplus \Lambda_{-}$ , the operator $\mathcal{R}$ can be written in a block form $$\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ ^{t}B & C \end{pmatrix}$$ where $^{t}A=A$ , $^{t}C=C$ and $trA=trC=\frac{S}{4}$ , with $S$ the scalar curvature of $M$ . So basically, if we write a $2$ -form $\omega=\omega_{+} + \omega_{-}$ according to the splitting, we have that we can also write $\mathcal{R}\omega=(\mathcal{R}\omega)_{+}+(\mathcal{R}\omega)_{-}$ : in particular, $\mathcal{R}(\omega_{\pm})=\mathcal{R}(\omega_{\pm})_{+}+\mathcal{R}(\omega_{\pm})_{-}$ and, for example, $A$ ""sends"" $\omega_+$ in $\mathcal{R}(\omega_{+})_{+}$ . Now, I read in a few papers that, if we call $A_{ij}$ the components of the matrix $A$ , with $i,j=1,2,3$ , we have that $A_{12}=A_{13}=0$ if and only if $A$ is a multiple of the identity matrix. How is that possible? I tried to work directly with the components of the Weyl tensor $W$ of the manifold, since its self-dual part is strictly related to the matrix $A$ , but I couldn't get anything. I tried also to exploit the fact that a matrix is a multiple of the identity matrix if and only if it commutes with any other matrix, but I don't know if it's useful. EDIT: In these days I read also that this fact may be related to the property of the curvature form $\Omega$ , i.e. $R_g ^{\star}\Omega = g^{-1}\Omega g$ , where $R_g$ denotes the right multiplication by $g\in SO(4)$ in the bundle of orthonormal frames of $N$ .

I don't think it's trivial, certainly not to me, as I am relying on a single probability and statistics class I took 20 years ago...  The problem is this: Imagine there are 10 white squares (the number of white squares is not terribly important other than it has to be 5 or greater). The probability of turning a white square black is 25% per attempt. The goal is to maximize the number of black squares you get. You have 10 ""moves"" to do so. Attempting to turn a white square black uses one move. Moving from one square to another also uses one move. You send in your ""moves"" in batches of 10 and, therefore, you cannot adjust subsequent moves regardless of the results of previous moves. Attempting to convert a square that you had previously successfully converted from white to black does not revert it back to white. It just means you wasted a move trying to convert an already black square. How would I even start figuring out the best way to maximize the number of black squares I get (i.e., how many attempts per square before moving to the next square)?

3555132,Inequality involving stochastic dominance in Likelihood Ratio Order,"Problem : I am struggling for some time to show that a particular inequality holds or to find a counterexample to disprove it: Suppose you have two continuous random variables $X_1, X_2$ with densities $f_1$ and $f_2$ , respectively, which are both distributed on the same compact interval $[\underline{x},\overline{x}]\subset \mathbb{R}_+$ and have the following properties: 1) Both densities are log-concave. 2) $f_i(\underline{x})\cdot\underline{x} \le 1$ $\hspace{2ex}$ $i \in \{1,2\}$ 3) $X_1$ stochastically dominates $X_2$ in the Likelihood Ratio Order, i.e. $\forall x <x'$ , $x,x' \in [\underline{x},\overline{x}]$ it holds that: \begin{equation}
\frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)} \le \frac{f_1(x')}{f_2(x')}
\end{equation} Note that the third property implies that $X_1$ stochastically dominates $X_2$ also in the Hazard Rate-, Reverse Hazard Rate- and First Order. Next, consider two particular realizations $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ which are implicitly defined in the following way: \begin{align*}
\hat{x}_1 = \frac{1-2\cdot F_1(\hat{x}_1)}{f(\hat{x}_1)} \hspace{4ex} \hat{x}_2 = \frac{1-2\cdot F_2(\hat{x}_2)}{f(\hat{x}_2)}
\end{align*} Properties 1) and 2) are sufficient for existence of such values in $[\underline{x},\overline{x}]$ and property 3) implies that $\hat{x}_1 > \hat{x}_2$ . With all this information, I wanted to show that $F_1(\hat{x}_1) \le F_2(\hat{x}_2)$ . Since I miserably failed in doing it so far, I also tried to find counterexamples and haven't found any. Approach : Start with the implicit equations defining $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ . Rearranging them yields: \begin{align}
&F_1(\hat{x}_1) = \frac{1-\hat{x}_1 \cdot f_1(\hat{x}_1)}{2}\\
&F_2(\hat{x}_2) = \frac{1-\hat{x}_2 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_2)}{2}
\end{align} Now, in order for the desired inequality to hold, namely $F_1(\hat{x}_1) \le F_2(\hat{x}_2)$ , it suffices to show that: \begin{align}
\frac{1-\hat{x}_1 \cdot f_1(\hat{x}_1)}{2} \le \frac{1-\hat{x}_2 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_2)}{2} \Leftrightarrow \hat{x}_1 \cdot f_1(\hat{x}_1) \ge \hat{x}_2 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_2)
\end{align} Now, since $\hat{x}_1 > \hat{x}_2$ , by property 3) we know that: \begin{align}
\frac{f_1(\hat{x}_1)}{f_2(\hat{x}_1)} \ge \frac{f_1(\hat{x}_2)}{f_2(\hat{x}_2)} \Leftrightarrow 
f_1(\hat{x}_1) \ge \frac{f_2(\hat{x}_1)\cdot f_1(\hat{x}_2)}{f_2(\hat{x}_2)}
\end{align} Using this for the original inequality, it now sufficies to show that: \begin{align}
\hat{x}_1 \cdot \frac{f_2(\hat{x}_1)\cdot f_1(\hat{x}_2)}{f_2(\hat{x}_2)} \ge \hat{x}_2 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_2) \Leftrightarrow \hat{x}_1 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_1)\cdot f_1(\hat{x}_2) \ge \hat{x}_2 \cdot f_2(\hat{x}_2)^2

But from the point of view of PDE Hilbert subspaces are just additional conditions on the function. For example, let us consider the Poisson equation $\Delta u=f$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$ . This problem has a unique solution on $H^1_0(\Omega)$ by Lax-Milgram. Let's take a hyperplane $H$ in $H^1_0(\Omega)$ defined by $H=\{v\in H^1_0(\Omega)~|~\int_\Omega v=0\}$ . Then once again by Lax-Milgram there's a unique solution $u'$ on $H$ . But it must be the same solution since $u$ is unique. So we get that for any solution $u$ of $\Delta u=f$ on $H^1_0(\Omega)$ one has $\int_\Omega u=0$ which is not true. Where is the mistake?

3555482,Is there a classification of bivector-valued cross products?,"Background Vector-valued cross products Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an field of characteristic $0$ . A $k$ -ary cross product in the vector space $V=\mathbb{F}^n$ equipped with an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is a $k$ -linear map $\times: V^k \to V$ which outputs a vector with the following two properties: It is orthogonal to all inputs. Its norm is the volume of the $k$ -dimensional paralellotope formed by these inputs, that is, $$|\!\times\!\!(\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_k)|^2 = \det \langle \mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{v}_j \rangle,$$ where the right hand side is a Gram determinant . These two conditions turn out to imply that composition with the inner product $\langle \times, \cdot \rangle$ ("" lowering an index "") defines a totally antisymmetric $(k+1)$ -linear map $\times : V^{k+1} \to \mathbb{F}$ , i.e. an alternating $(k+1)$ -form. Equivalently, given a $(k+1)$ -form satisfying the appropriate volume condition one can define a cross product by ""raising an index"". In the following we restrict to $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$ with the standard inner product. The dimensions where a cross product exists have been completely classified (see for example here ): There is a trivial $k$ -ary cross product for any $k\ge n+1$ , which is identically zero. A nullary cross product (equivalently a unit vector) exists for any $n\ge 1$ . A unary cross product (corresponding to a symplectic form) exists in any even dimension $n=2m$ . A $(n-1)$ -ary cross product (corresponding to a volume form) exists in any dimension $n$ . For example, the ordinary cross product in 3D is of this kind. There are only two exceptional cross products not covered by the above cases, binary in dimension $7$ (corresponding to an associative $3$ -form ) and ternary in dimension $8$ (corresponding to a Cayley $4$ -form ). They can both be expressed in terms of the octonions, see for example this question for details. So we have the following table: $$\begin{array}
{|c|c|c|c|c|}

\hline\end{array}$$ Note that if there is a $k$ -ary product in dimension $n$ , there is automatically a $(k-1)$ -ary product in dimension $n-1$ obtained by contracting with an unit vector. This explains the diagonal patterns. Bivector-valued cross products Similarly, we can define a $k$ -ary bivector-valued cross product (BV cross product or BVCP for short), which is a $k$ -linear map $\times : V^k \to \Lambda^2 V$ outputting a bivector with the following two properties: It is orthogonal to all inputs (i.e. the left contraction $\mathbf{v}_j \: \lrcorner \times\!\!(\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_k)$ vanishes for all $1\le j \le k$ ). Its norm is the volume of the paralellotope formed by these inputs. As before, given any BV cross product we may define a corresponding $(k+2)$ -form and viceversa, by lowering or raising two indices. Note that the wedge/outer product of two vectors is not a BV cross product, since it doesn't satisfy the first condition (in fact it does the complete opposite, since the plane spanned by $a \wedge b$ contains $a$ and $b$ ). So far I haven't been able to find a classification of BV cross products anywhere (this might be because I've been searching for the wrong terms). However, we can give a partial classification by trying to find bivector-valued analogues of each class of vector-valued cross product: There are trivial $k$ -ary BV cross products for any $k\ge n+1$ . A nullary BV cross product, or equivalently a bivector of norm $1$ , exists for any $n\ge 2$ . A unary BV cross product exists in any dimension $n=3a+7b$ , since then we can decompose $V$ into the direct sum of vector spaces of the form $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\mathbb{R}^7$ , and take a corresponding $3$ -form which restricts to a suitable multiple of the volume form in each $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a multiple of the associative $3$ -form in each $\mathbb{R}^7$ . On the other hand, no unary product exists for $n = 1, 2$ for dimensional reasons. Since every number greater than $11$ can be expressed as $3a+7b$ for some $a, b$ , this leaves in doubt only the cases $n=4, 5, 8$ and $11$ . (The cases $n=4, 5$ are now ruled out and $n=8, 11$ are confirmed, see the updates). A $(n-2)$ -ary cross product (corresponding to a properly normalized volume form) exists in any dimension $n$ . The Hodge dual of the associative $3$ -form, properly normalized, induces a binary BV cross product in dimension $7$ , and similarly the Cayley form itself induces another in dimension $8$ . I'm sure there is a better way to prove it, but I just used the well-known correspondence between bivectors and skew-symmetric matrices and used a CAS to check symbolically that the relations $M_{\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{x} = M_{\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{y} = 0$ and $||M_{\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}}|| = |\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}|$ hold, where $||\cdot||$ is the Frobenius norm. Here is a tentative table summarizing the above: $$\begin{array}

\hline\end{array}$$ Question My question is: Is the list above correct? Are there any other possible BV cross products, e.g. binary in dimension $10$ ? UPDATE: We can generalize the Hodge dual argument we used to get the $7$ -dimensional binary BVCP to rule out the existence of BVCPs for some $n$ and $k$ . First, note that if we know a cross product doesn't exist for some $n$ and $k$ , automatically we know that none exists for $n+a$ and $k+a$ with any $a>0$ , since otherwise we could contract the latter with $a$ unit vectors and obtain a contradiction. A $p$ -vector-valued cross product is the obvious generalization of vector-valued ( $p=1$ ) and bivector-valued ( $p=2$ ) cross products to multivectors of arbitrary degree. With some effort, I have proven that a $(n,k,p)$ -cross product induces a $(n,k,n-2k-p)$ -cross product by lowering $k$ indices, taking the Hodge dual, raising $k$ indices again and renormalizing. Conversely, if there are no $(n,k,p)$ -cross products, we can deduce the nonexistence of $(n,k,n-2k-p)$ -cross products. Note that for scalar-valued cross products ( $p=0$ ) the orthogonality condition is trivially satisfied. Their classification is easy to state: they exist only for $k\ge n$ or for $k=0$ , $n$ arbitrary. Using the classifications of scalar and vector-valued products and applying Hodge duality to $(n,k,p) = (4,1,0)$ , $(5,1,1)$ , $(8,3,0)$ and $(9,3,1)$ , we prove the nonexistence of BVCPs at $(4,1,2)$ , $(5,1,2)$ , $(8,3,2)$ and $(9,3,2)$ , and of any others as we move diagonally in the bottom right direction. I marked some cells in the table with dark-red dots where we know BVCPs don't exist. Note that the diagonal below any dot is also ruled out by the discussion above. In light of this new information, the question can now be divided in two main subquestions: Are there unary BVCPs in dimensions $8$ and $11$ ? UPDATE 2: I have found an $8$ -dimensional unary BVCP satisfying the conditions, whose corresponding $3$ -form is given by a rescaling of the structure constants of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ . It follows that an unary product exists in dimensions $n=3a+7b+8c$ , and in particular also for $n=11$ . I updated the table with these two new cases. Are there binary BVCPs in dimension greater than $8$ ?","['cross-product', 'octonions', 'linear-algebra', 'recreational-mathematics', 'exterior-algebra']"

The tool that I used measures seven types of motivation, which I've coded as IMK, IMA, IMS, EMID, EMIJ, EMX, and AM.

The above picture shows that for every open set $V$ (yellow) in $(X,d)$ ,there is an open set $U\subset V$ (shown in white) which does not intersect $A$ .

3555733,Help understanding why finite Boolean rngs must be rings,"I'm working through the exercises in Introduction to Boolean Algebra by Halmos and Givant. Looking to show the following, an exercise from the first chapter: every finite Boolean rng must have a unit. Halmos and Givant attribute this observation to Stone, in his original paper on the representation theorem. Stone shows the result by explicitly constructing the unit as a sum of elementary symmetric polynomials. For a finite Boolean ring $B$ with $|B| = n$ , we consider the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, which are: $e_1(x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_1 + \dots + x_n$ , $e_2(x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_1 x_2 + \dots + x_{n-1}x_n$ , ... $e_n(x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_1\cdots x_n$ Stone shows that the unit in a finite Boolean rng (with $n$ elements) is given as the sum of $e_1(a_1, \dots, a_n) + \dots + e_n(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ where $\{a_1, \dots, a_n\} = B$ . What I'm wondering, is how one could figure this out? What observations about Boolean rings do I need to make in order to know that the above construction is the right one to try? As a side note, I see that in this post, Martin Brandenburg gives another argument for the conclusion using the Nakayama lemma (which seems a little high-powered for this exercise) and mentions that a direct argument is possible.","['boolean-algebra', 'logic', 'abstract-algebra', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'boolean-ring']"

If $H$ contains an open $s-$ dimensional rectangle, then $\mathscr{P}$ is called full-rank. Otherwise, $\mathscr{P}$ is called curved. Definition 2: An exponential family is of rank $k$ if and only if the generating statistic $T$ is $k-$ dimensional and $\{1, T_1(X), \ldots,T_k(X)\}$ are linearly independent with positive probability. Formally, $P_\eta\left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}a_jT_j(X)=a_{k+1}\right)<1$ unless all $a_j$ are zeros. Here, definition 1 I took from this note and definition 2 is from Doksum & Bickel's.

3555985,Establishing that a function is a well-defined homomorphism,"I am working with the group homomorphism $f: G \to \text{Aut (G)}$ , $g \mapsto f_g = ghg^{-1}$ , and am trying to prove that $f$ is a well-defined homomorphism. To show that $f$ is well-defined, we must establish three facts: (1) that $f_g$ is a well-defined function; (2) that $f_g$ is in fact an element of $\text{Aut ($G$)}$ , so $f$ actually sends an element $g \in G$ to an element of the codomain of $f$ and (3) if $g = h$ , then then $f(g) = f(h)$ . Proof of (1): 
Suppose $x = y$ . It suffices to show that for a fixed $g \in G$ , we have $gxg^{-1} = gyg^{-1}$ . By cancellation, we have \begin{align*}
gxg^{-1} = gyg^{-1} \iff gx = gy \iff x = y.
\end{align*} This verifies (1). Proof of (2): We need to show first that $f_g$ is a bijection, for which it suffices to exhibit an inverse, $f_{g^{-1}}$ , such that \begin{align*}
f_g = f_{g^{-1}} = f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_g = \text{id}_G.
\end{align*} Define $f_{g^{-1}} = g^{-1} x g$ . Then, for an arbitrary $h \in H$ , we have: \begin{align*}
(f_g \circ f_{g^{-1}}) (h) & = f_g (f_{g^{-1}} (h)) \\
& = f_g (g^{-1} hg) \\
& = g(g^{-1} hg)g^{-1} \\
& = (gg^{-1})h(gg^{-1}) \\
& = e_G he_G \\
& = h
\end{align*} Since $h$ was arbitrary, we have $f_g \circ f_{g^{-1}}$ . For the reverse direction, for arbitrary $x \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*}
(f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_g)(h) & = f_{g^{-1}} (f_g (h)) \\
& = f_{g^{-1}} (ghg^{-1}) \\
& = g^{-1} (ghg^{-1})g \\
& = (g^{-1} g) h (g^{-1} g) \\
& = e_G h e_G h \\
& = h
\end{align*} Since $h$ was arbitrary, $f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_G = \text{id}_G$ , so we have exhibited a proper inverse for $f_g$ . Hence, $f_g$ is a bijection. It suffices to establish that $f_g$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to $G$ . It suffices to demonstrate that $f_g$ satisfies the homomorphism property. For any $x, y \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*}
f_g (xy) & = g(xy)g^{-1} \\
& = (gx)(yg^{-1}) \\
& = (gx)e_G (yg^{-1}) \\
& = (gx)(g^{-1} g)(yg^{-1}) \\
& = (gxg^{-1}) (gyg^{-1}) \\
& = f_g (x) f_G (y).
\end{align*} Hence, $f_g \in \text{Aut ($G$)}$ . This verifies (2). Proof of (3). Let $x, y \in G$ , and suppose $x = y$ . It suffices to show that the resulting automorphism, $f_x (h) = xhx^{-1}$ and $f_y (h) = ygy^{-1}$ , represent the same mapping. Since $f_x (h)$ and $f_y (y)$ have the same domain, $G$ , it suffices to show that $f_x (h) = f_y (h)$ for all $h \in H$ . That is, $xhx^{-1} = yhy^{-1}$ . We have: \begin{align*}
x = y \iff xh = yh \iff xhx^{-1} = yhy^{-1}.
\end{align*} This verifies (3). These prove that $f$ is well-defined. It suffices to establish that it obeys the homomorphism property. Let $x, y \in G$ . We must show that $f(xy) = f(x) f(y)$ . For arbitrary $h \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*}
f(xy) (h) & = f_{xy} (h) \\
& = (xy)h(xy)^{-1} \\
& = (xy)h(y^{-1} x^{-1}) \\
& = x(yhy^{-1})x^{-1} \\
& = (f_x \circ f_y)(h) \\
& = f(x)f(y)(h)

3556137,Another equivalent notion of ergodicity,"Let $T\colon X\to X$ be a measure preserving transformation on a probability space $(X,\mu)$ . We say that $T$ is ergodic if $A$ is measurable and $T^{-1}(A)=A$ implies that $\mu(A)\in\{0,1\}$ . I have seen that the following are equivalent: $T$ is ergodic, If $B$ is measurable and $\mu(T^{-1}(B)\Delta B)=0$ , then $\mu(B)\in\{0,1\}$ . (Here $\Delta$ stands for the symmetric difference.) However, I was reasoning as follows. If $C$ is measurable and $C\subset T^{-1}(C)$ , then $$\mu(T^{-1}(C)\Delta C)=\mu(T^{-1}(C)\setminus C)+\mu(C\setminus T^{-1}(C))=\mu(T^{-1}(C)\setminus C)\\ =\mu(T^{-1}(C))-\mu(C)=\mu(C)-\mu(C)=0.$$ So I concluded that there was another characterization of ergodicity, namely: If $C$ is measurable and $C\subset T^{-1}(C)$ , then $\mu(C)\in\{0,1\}$ . Note that it is clearly indeed also true that 3 implies 1. But I find this characterization really counterintuitive, especially since I do not encounter this definition in the literature. I think it is a nice characterization for the following reason: Suppose $T$ is ergodic and we want to show that a measurable set $C$ has either measure $0$ or $1$ . Then, by 3, it suffices to prove that $C\subset T^{-1}(C)$ . The reverse inclusion does not even have to hold!

Alright so ""this locates distinct rational number in each discontinuity"" is kinda wierd so why not irrational and irrational are uncountable so this tells discontinuities of the function is uncountable.","['proof-explanation', 'proof-writing', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'limits']"

3556612,Unique increasing solution to a separable differential equation (piecewise $C_1$),"I want to find the increasing function $y(x): [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ which is defined implicitely as the solution to the following equation: $f_1(x) = f_2(y(x)) \quad \forall x \in [0,1]$ where $f_1(), f_2()$ are known and $C_1$ on $[0,1]$ $f_1$ and $f_2$ are such that an increasing solution exists (I have existence already proved elsewhere). I want to show that there exists a unique increasing solution $y(x)$ starting from $y(0) = 0$ . This solution should be unique as long as the set such that $f_1’(x) = 0$ is of null measure .  The intuition is quite simple: both function goes through exactly the same points, in the same order (just not at the same speed) (you can see this graphically). So as long as there is no flat part, there should be a unique mapping from $x$ to $y$ . Remark: on the optimal path, given the equation, this equation will also imply that the set such that $f_2’(y(x)) = 0$ is also of null measure, and the null derivative coincides. Remark 2: Obviously, if $f_2()$ is strictly monotone, we can just invert it to find the solution: $y(x) = f_2^{-1}(f_1(x)) \quad \forall x \in [0,1]$ To solve my problem, since I’m solving for a function, I thought I could resort to properties of differential equations (Picard-Lindelof for e.g.); Differentiating my equation yields: $f_2’(y(x)) y’(x) = f_1’(x)$ . $\iff y’(x) = f_1’(x) / f_2’(y(x)) := g(x, y(x))$ when $f_2’(y) \neq 0$ By Picard-Lindelof, if $g()$ is $C_1$ on $[0,1]$ , then I have a unique solution. But this would correspond to the monotone case in my remark 2 above. The difficulty I have is with the points with null derivatives. These null derivatives yields problem because there is a indeterminacy in $g()$ on the optimal path ( $0$ over $0$ , since $y’ > 0$ ), and at other points the function is not even defined. So I cannot resort to Picard Lindelof.
However, since I’m looking for an increasing solution , the solution should still be unique . But I cannot find any proof of that, or any variation of Picard-Lindelof doing this kind of stuff (i.e adding increasing constraint into the system). Hence my first question: Question: does a variation of Picard-Lindelof uniqueness result exists for my kind of problem? (i.e. problem with increasing constraint on the solution) would be great if I could just find a reference for this as I was not able to find any . Otherwise, I am trying to build the solution myself, resorting to some kind of pasting. But I’m not sure it’s correct to do it this way.
The idea is that, I’m using Picard-Lindelof starting from $y(0)=0$ up to the first point where $f_2’(y) = 0$ that I denote $y_1$ . Then I’m doing it again from $y_1$ to $y_2$ (the second point where $f_2’(y) = 0$ ). And so on and so forth. There are two ‘problems’ with this solution: How do I ‘start’ from the $y_k$ points as generally speaking, $g(x_k, y_k(x_k))$ is not defined (or actually indeterminate $0$ over $0$ ), so I’m not sure I can write it down. I should have trouble with this notion of ‘points’ with null derivatives. What if they are an infinite number of such points? I think I can prove that it is not possible on the compact set [0,1] if $f_1, f_2$ are $C_1$ and if the set such that $f’_1 = 0$ is of null measure. But I’m not sure and there might exist some $x sin(x)$ case I did not think about (even if $x sin(x)$ is not $C_1$ in $0$ so it does not enter my setup). And more importantly, if I can resort to this concept of points, I can just use the original system directly: because it is piecewise monotone between those points, I can invert it between those points! All of this to say I’m really not sure about how to build a proof so far. I have a simple showcase example to illustrate the problem: Imagine $f_1(x) = 1 - 4 (x - 0.5)^2$ , $f_2(y) = 4(\sqrt{y} - y)$ . This example is built such that the unique increasing solution to this problem with initial value $y(0) = 0$ is $y(x) = x^2$ . The question is: how can I recover this using my differential equation $f’_2(y(x)) y’(x) = f’_1(x)$ ? By my method, I’ll just realize that $y_1 = 0.25$ and $x_1 = 0.5$ (and that there is only one point such that the derivatives are $0$ ). And I’ll just have to split the Picard-Lindelof in two parts: starting from $(x,y)=(0,0)$ to $(0.5, 0.25)$ ; and then from $(0.5, 0.25)$ to $(1, 1)$ . But even there, you see that the system of differential equations is ‘indeterminate’ at $(0.5, 0.25)$ , so how can I ‘start’ again from there? That’s why I find my ‘proof’ to be quite clumsy so far, and why I would like something more correct, if possible an already built result that I could cite or from which I could start my proof. EDIT: since my ODE is separable I should solve it by getting to the initial implicit form, so I’m not sure getting to the differential equation is even necessary; I thought it could be easier to get some standard results about uniqueness though. But maybe I could get them with the initial implicit definition of $y(x)$ by adding a monotonicity constraint: i.e. there exists only one strictly increasing part in the integral curve. But I don’t know how to show this. Sketch of an answer: If the set such that $f_1’(x) = 0$ has a finite number of points (instead of imposing measure zero), then I will do the proof as follows: Denote $x_k$ the ordered set of $K$ points such that $f_1’(x_k) = 0$ . Since we know the functions f_1, f_2, are such that an increasing solution exists, $f_2’(y)$ must also have the same finite number $K$ of points with $f_2’(y_k) = 0$ .
Using the order of these points and the monotonicity constraint on the solution, we know that $y(x_k) = y_k \forall k$ . Now, I can just use the fact that $f_2()$ is piecewise monotone between each $y_k$ . By monotonicity, since $y_k = y(x_k)$ , then all $y \in [y_k, y_{k+1}]$ are images of $x \in [x_k, x_{k+1}]$ . This way starting from (x, y) = (0,0), we have: $\forall x \in [0, x_1), \quad f_2(y) = f_1(x)$ . Moreover, on $[0, y(x_1))$ , $f_2$ is monotone (and $C_1$ ). So it is inversible, and we get: $\forall x \in [0, x_1), \quad y = f_2^{-1}(f_1(x))$ . Then we have $y(x_1) = y_1$ . And we repeat the same procedure on $[x_1, x_2)$ , and so on and so forth up to $[x_K, 1]$ . This way, I get a unique increasing mapping $y(x)$ exploiting piecewise monotonicity of my function. Now, I’m not $100\%$ sure of this proof. And more importantly, I’m not sure how to write it down if I have an infinite number of points with null derivative.
I guess the idea would be exactly the same (all that matters is the ordering). It’s just that I’m not sure everything I wrote above would follow through and still be correct. Maybe I did not think about some particular case that would forbid my piecewise inversions. For example, $f_2(y) = y^3 sin(1/y)$ cannot be considered piecewise monotone near $0$ I suppose... But I’m not sure. Remark: I thought ODE would have results on this (i.e. proving existence of a unique increasing solution), but I cannot find anything, so in the end using the ODE form of my equation seems quite useless. I just exploit the initial implicit form.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'monotone-functions', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'piecewise-continuity']"

3557018,Probability that random variable is inside cone,"Suppose $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a random variable with mean $\mu$ and covariance $
\Sigma$ . Consider a stochastic convex optimization problem, i.e. an optimization problem with chance constraints , meaning there is a small, but finite probability, $\Delta\leq 0.5$ , of violating the constraints. In all of the cases I've encountered so far, you assume that the constraint space, $\mathcal{X}$ , is a polytope , meaning it can be written as $$
\mathcal{X} \triangleq \bigcap_{j=1}^{M} \ \{x:\alpha_j^\intercal x \leq \beta_j\}
$$ Qualitatively, this represents a finite intersection of linear inequality constraints, which is a convex region. In 2D, this is simply a polygon, with $M$ vertices. For example, if $M = 3$ , then the intersection of the three lines would form a triangle. If $M = 4$ , this would be a square, and so on. The reason people assume the constraint space is a convex polytope is because, using Boole's inequality (which gives an upper bound on the union of sets), the chance constraints can be written as $$
\begin{align}
\text{Pr}(x\notin&\mathcal{X}) \leq \Delta\\
&\Updownarrow\\
\text{Pr}(\alpha_j^\intercal x \leq \beta_j) &\geq 1 - \delta_j, \ \forall j = 1,...,M\\
\sum_{j=1}^{M} \delta_j &\leq \Delta,
\end{align}
$$ where the joint probability of violating the constraints is split up into the individual probability of violating each $j$ th constraint. This is extremely useful, because the second expression is nothing more than the probability of a random variable with mean $\alpha_j^\intercal \mu$ and covariance $\alpha_j^\intercal \Sigma \alpha_j$ . Thus, this probability can be written in terms of the standard normal CDF ( $\Phi$ ) as $$
\Phi\Bigg[\frac{\beta_j - \alpha_j^\intercal \mu}{\sqrt{\alpha_j^\intercal \Sigma \alpha_j}} \Bigg] \geq 1 - \delta_j \Rightarrow \alpha_j^\intercal \mu + \|\Sigma^{1/2} \alpha_j\|^2 \Phi^{-1}(1-\delta_j) \leq \beta_j,
$$ since $\Sigma > 0$ is always positive definite, as it represents a standard deviation. The above inequality constraint is a second order cone constraint, and the resulting optimization problem is a SOCP. However, what if the constraint space is now not an polytope (or polygon), but rather a cone , specifically a convex cone. In that case, $\mathcal{X}$ would be defined as $$
\mathcal{X} = \{x : \|Ax+b\|_2 \leq c^\intercal x + d\}.
$$ Is it possible, in any way, to calculate $\text{Pr}(x\notin\mathcal{X})$ , or something like that as in the case of a polytope? You would have to make some kind of approximation or relaxation, such as Markov's inequality or Chebyshev inequality, to get rid of the probability and turn it into an expectation. However, I can't seem to figure out a solution. For my purposes, the cone is centered at the origin, so $b = d = 0$ if that makes it simpler to work with. This type of constraint is more natural in a physical setting, especially in controls, where you want to steer distributions from some initial $x\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\Sigma_0)$ , to the origin for example.

So, for theorem 1, for any $x \in M$ the set $\Lambda(x)$ contains an arithmetic progression $\{a(x)+b(x)j\}_{j=0}^{k-1}$ of length $k$ . Thus, to any point $x \in M$ we have assigned a pair of numbers $(a(x),b(x))$ . Now, there is a step that I don't understand: ""Since for any $x \in X$ we have $(a(x),b(x)) \in [1,N]^{2}$ , there is a set $M' \subseteq M$ such that $\mu(M')\geq \mu(E)/(2N^{2})$ , and to any point of this set we have assigned the same pair $(a,b)$ . In this case $\mu(\bigcap_{j=0}^{k-1} T^{-(a+bj)}E)\geq \mu(M')>0$ ."" Where the subset $M'$ comes from?","['ergodic-theory', 'combinatorics', 'arithmetic-progressions']"

Let's say $$ p = 2137 $$ Is there a simpler way to determine whether $p\mid n : n \in \mathbb{Z}$ than factorizing $n$ ?
Divisibility rules are uncommon for integers larger than 30, let alone primes.","['number-theory', 'divisibility', 'prime-numbers']"

3557228,Derangement with letters repeated.,"Find the total number of Derangement of the word:
""mississippi"".
Can some one please suggest a concrete method in how to deal with Derangement with repeated letters..
I solved a question like Derangement of ""Bottle"", using help of an answer on stack exchange(you can see it here ), but I was unable to comprehend when more than 1 letters got repeated which is the case with ""mississippi""..
As per the answer to find derangement for Bottle I did: $$(D6-D4-2D5)/2$$ So please suggest some concrete methods and also some references for further reading ...","['permutations', 'combinations', 'inclusion-exclusion', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3557241,Existence of a minimal radius when a map fails to be a diffeomorphism,"Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be the closed unit disk. Let $f:D \to D$ a smooth map with everywhere invertible differential. For each $t \in (0,1]$ let $D_t$ denote the closed disk with radius $t$ . Question: Suppose that $f$ is not a diffeomorphism on $D$ .   Does there exist a minimal $t \in (0,1]$ such that the restriction $f|_{D_t}$ is not a diffeomorphism onto its image? Does the answer change if we replace $D_t$ by the open disk with radius $t$ ? (If not, does the critical value of $t$ change?) Note that the set $A=\{ t \in (0,1] \, | \, f|_{D_t} \text{is a diffeomorphism onto its image} \}$ is clearly ""closed down"", i.e. $\,$ $(y \in A \, \text{  and  }\, 0<x<y) \Rightarrow x \in A$ . Writing $\sup A=s$ , we then must have $A=(0,s)$ or $A=(0,s]$ . An equivalent formulation of the question would then be to prove that $A$ is an open set, or $s \notin A$ . (Then $s$ would be the required minimal $t$ ). My immediate approach (assuming we are talking about open disks, actually) was the following: Note that the restriction of $f$ to an open subset of $\text{int}(D)$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image if and only if it is injective (due to the inverse function theorem). Now, take $s_n \searrow s$ ; we know that $f|_{D_{s_n}}$ is not injective- so there exist $x_n \neq y_n \in D_{s_n}$ such that $f(x_n)=f(y_n)$ . By compactness we can assume that $x_n \to x,y_n \to y$ . If $x \neq y$ we are done since $x,y \in D_s$ . But I don't see any reason to exclude the possibility $x=y$ .","['singularity', 'smooth-manifolds', 'real-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

3557331,Cauchy-Schwarz inequality of the carré du champ operator,"I want to prove the inequality $$\Gamma(f,g)^2 \leq \Gamma(f,f) \Gamma(g,g) \ \mu \text {-almost everywhere}$$ for $f, g \in \mathcal{A}$ where $\Gamma$ denotes the carré du champ operator. More precisely:
Let $(E, \mathcal{E})$ be a Polish space with $\sigma$ -finite measure $\mu$ . The function $\Gamma: \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ is symmetric, bilinear and satisfies $\Gamma(f,f) \geq 0$ $\mu$ -almost everywhere for all $f \in \mathcal{A}$ . $\mathcal{A}$ is a subalgebra of $L^\infty(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)$ which is dense in $L^p(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)$ for all $p \in [1, \infty)$ . My idea was to copy the proof of Cauchy Schwarz's inequality. We obtain $$
0 \leq \Gamma(f - \lambda g, f - \lambda g) = \Gamma(f,f) - 2\lambda\Gamma(f,g) + \lambda^2 \Gamma(g,g)
$$ $\mu$ -almost everywhere for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ . But i cannot justify the argument defining $\lambda := \frac{\Gamma(f,g)}{\Gamma(g,g)}$ since the non-negativity of $\Gamma(f - \lambda g, f - \lambda g)$ is just $\mu$ almost everywhere where the sets of measure zero might depend on $\lambda$ . Annother idea is to use Cauchy Schwarz's inequality for the bilinear form $(f,g) \mapsto \int \Gamma(f,g) \varphi d \mu$ for fixed $\varphi \in L^1(E, \mathcal{E}, \mu)$ , $\varphi \geq 0$ . We obtain $$
\left ( \int \Gamma(f,g) \varphi d \mu \right )^2 \leq  \int \Gamma(f,f) \varphi d \mu \int \Gamma(g,g) \varphi d \mu 
$$ but I don't know how to get a pointwise estimate from that. Tto the best of my knowledge, Lebesgue differentiation theorem fail in general Polish spaces.","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'functional-analysis', 'probability']"
