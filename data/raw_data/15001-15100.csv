I tried to do integration by parts... $$\int\log(x) \; dx = (x-1)\log(x) $$ Let $I=\int\log(x) e^x \; dx$.
Therefore,
$$
I = (x-1)\log(x) e^x - \int (x-1)\log(x) e^x \; dx

$$= (x-1)\log(x) e^x - \int (x)\log(x) e^x \; dx +\int \log(x) e^x \; dx$$

119565,Applying representation $f(z)=w_0+\zeta(z)^n$ to $\cos z$ (from Ahlfors' Complex Analysis).,"I'm working on an exercise which asks to apply the representation $f(z)=w_0+\zeta(z)^n$ to $\cos z$ with $z_0=0$, and determine $\zeta(z)$ explicitly. (This is from Ahlfors, page 133, ex. 3 by the way). Now $\cos(0)=1$, so $w_0=1$. Also, $\cos z-1$ has a zero at $z_0=0$ of order $2$. So I can write $\cos z-1=z^2g(z)$ with $g(z)$ analytic at $z_0$, and $g(z_0)\neq 0$. Taking $z^2g(z)=\zeta(z)^2$, I just find $\zeta(z)=\sqrt{\cos z-1}$, so
$$
\cos z=1+\sqrt{\cos z-1}^2.
$$ I'm worried, have I done this correctly? I don't feel like I've done anything of substance, so I think the exercise might have been asking for something else. I think Ahlfors is referring to a theorem stating Suppose that $f(z)$ is analytic at $z_0$, $f(z_0)=w_0$ and that $f(z)-w_0$ has a zero of order $n$ at $z_0$. If $\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small, there exists a corresponding $\delta>0$ such that for all $a$ with $|a-w_0|<\delta$ the equation $f(z)=a$ has exactly $n$ roots in the disk $|z-z_0|<\epsilon$. Later discussion states that under the assumption of this theorem, we can write
$$
f(z)-w_0=(z-z_0)^ng(z)
$$
where $g(z)$ is analytic at $z_0$ and $g(z_0)\neq 0$. Choose $\epsilon>0$ so that $|g(z)-g(z_0)|<|g(z_0)|$ for $|z-z_0|<\epsilon$. In this nbhd is's possible to define a single-valued analytic branch of $\sqrt[n]{g(z)}$ which we denote by $h(z)$. We have thus
$$
f(z)-w_0=\zeta(z)^n,\qquad \zeta(z)=(z-z_0)h(z).
$$
Since $\zeta'(z_0)=h(z_0)\neq 0$, the mapping $\zeta\zeta(z)$ is topological in a neighborhood of $z_0$. I think the implied representation is related to the conventions here.",['complex-analysis']
119569,How are the pigeonholes calculated in this pigeon-hole problem?,"The question is as follows: To prepare for a marathon, an elite runner runs at least  once a day over the next 44 days, for a total of 70 runs in all. Show that there's a period of consecutive days during which the runner runs
exactly 17 times. I know the mechanics of solving it. It is: Let $r_i$ be the total number of runs as of day $i$ . $1 \le r_1 \le r_2  \le r_3 \ldots \le r_{44} = 70$ Let's do $r_i + 17$ $18 \le r_1 + 17 \le r_2 + 17 \le \ldots \le r_{44} + 17 = 70 + 17 = 87$ Now counting the pigeons: $r_i$ is $44$ values $r_i + 17$ is $44$ values. $44 + 44 = 88$ pigeons. The pigeonholes are the $87$ values available. So by the  pigeonhole principle $r_i = r_j + 17 \le i > j$ (I don't really get this part).

119641,An elegant non-technical account on the work of Joseph Fourier.,"It would seem difficult for a naive person to understand the beauty of work done by Fourier. So as far as I know, one can use the Fourier transforms, analysis and series to apply them for heat equations, and its very evident that present world's seminal mathematician J.Tate has also used the Fourier analysis in his celebrated thesis. So I was looking for some most elegant explanation about the beauty of Fourier analysis giving an intuition into the subject, and for the sake of brevity, assume that the targeted naive reader has some basic mathematical knowledge, ( not so naive !! ). I think the most difficult job is to explain things naively. But there are many people who can explain it mathematically taking a function and applying it and showing the effect, but its the most tough job to do it other way, as remarked by Prof.Einstein, "" If you can't explain simply, you don't understand it well-enough "" . I would be very happy if someone maps the theory to the nature and explain the theory in terms of things going on around us, like trees, leaves etc..( not necessarily trees and leaves, but in any way ) and how could one apply them to the nature practically.

119671,How to find a flat using game theory?,"I had the idea that maybe probability/game theory knowledge helps finding a flat more systematically. I assume that I have some online offers with number parameters: prize size (square meters) distance (to work in minutes) I have some limits for all of them, but there are still many offers remaining. Unfortunately, I have to decide immediately if I take a flat or not since otherwise it will be gone. My main idea is to estimate how much more I can contraint these three parameters numerically and still find a flat within some reasonable time. Basically I define a stronger ""soft limit"" rather than the neccessary ""hard limit"". If I filter out too much, there will be too few offers and the search would take too long. From watching the offers I can estimate the distribution of these three parameters. Of course there are more non-numerical parameters so just being within range doesn't qualify the flat completely. It still might be dismissed, due to other factors. Any suggestions?

I came upon the above double integral when simplifying an expression for a probability density function. How can I demonstrate that the integral is zero for any positive constants, $a$, $b$ and $c$? I've verified the result numerically. At the moment it seems rather fascinating to me that the integral should always be zero given the presence of three free variables, and I would expect there to be a relatively simple derivation. I've tried all sorts of approaches (integral substitutions including polar coordinates, differentiating under the integral, splitting the domain of integration into pieces) without seeming to make progress. To answer Ali's comment, below I give my crude Matlab code for evaluating the double integral (with the trapezoidal rule) and one output.

119725,Find probabilities of winning in a modified version of Monty Hall Problem,"So I modified the original version of the Monty Hall problem and allow there to have 4 doors; 1 car and 3 goats behind the doors. I will choose one door, Monty, who knows where the car is, randomly reveals one of the other 3 doors to show a goat. In a case which I didn't switch doors, my chance of winning is clearly $\frac{1}{4}$. Suppose I select Door #1, Monty randomly reveals a goat from one of the remaining doors, I make a switch. In this case, I believe I can calculate my probabilities of winning this way: Let $S:\{$ Succeed if I switch$\}$, and let $D_j: \{$ Car behind the Door $j$, where $j=\{1,2,3,4\}$ $ \\} $ Since $P(D_j)=\frac{1}{4}$ , Then, $$\begin{align} P(S)&=P(S|D_{ 1 })\times \frac { 1 }{ 4 } +P(S|D_{ 2 })\times \frac { 1 }{ 4 } +P(S|D_{ 3 })\times \frac { 1 }{ 4 } +P(S|D_{ 4 })\times \frac { 1 }{ 4 } \\ \qquad &=0+(\frac { 1 }{ 2 } \cdot \frac { 1 }{ 4 } )+(\frac { 1 }{ 2 } \cdot \frac { 1 }{ 4 } )+(\frac { 1 }{ 2 } \cdot \frac { 1 }{ 4 } )\\ \qquad &=\frac { 3 }{ 8 } \end{align}$$ Now, in another strategy, say I do this: I select Door #1. Then, If Monty opens Door #2, I switch to Door #3. If Monty opens Door #3, I switch to Door #4. If Monty opens Door #4, I remain with my initial first choice of Door
#1. Of course, all that Monty reveals are goats. I want to find out the probability of winning with this strategy. Let $A_j$ be the $j$th event in the above numbered list, where $j=\{1,2,3\}$. Then to find the probability of winning with this new strategy, I find: $$
P(S)=P(S|A_1)P(A_1)+P(S|A_2)P(A_2)+P(S|A_3)P(A_3)
$$ I am not sure, but I rationalise the chance of happening for the events $P(A_1)=P(A_2)=P(A_3)=\frac{1}{3}$. With 4 doors and I have chosen 1 door, Monty left with 3 doors. So I thought it has to be $\frac{1}{3}$. After here, I'm very confuse with how I should proceed on.
$$P(S|A_1) = P(S|A_2) =\frac { P(A_1\cap S)}{ P(A) } =\frac { P(A_2\cap S)}{ P(A) }= \frac { \frac { 1 }{ 3 } \times \frac { 3 }{ 8 } }{ \frac { 1 }{ 3 }  } =\frac { 3 }{ 8 }  $$ In this equation, I assumed independence between $A_j$ and $S$, even though I don't know if they really are. Also, I am reusing the probability of $P(S)$ from the earlier strategy , which I am still pondering if it even make sense to do this. Anyway, so if I proceed from above, I will get:
$$\begin{align*}
P(S)&=P(S|A_1)P(A_1)+P(S|A_2)P(A_2)+P(S|A_3)P(A_3) \\
&=\frac { 3 }{ 8 }\cdot\frac { 1 }{ 3 } +\frac { 3 }{ 8 }\cdot\frac { 1 }{ 3 } +\frac { 1 }{ 4 }\cdot\frac { 1 }{ 3 } =\frac { 1 }{ 3 }
\end{align*}$$ Finally, my probability of winning with this new strategy would be $\frac{1}{3}$. But I am not certain at all if this is correct or not. Is what I have done and thought correct? What should I do to find out the probabilities of the different strategies?","['statistics', 'probability']"

119831,How to prove that a bounded linear operator is compact?,"I encountered a homework problem that says: If $A$ is a bounded linear operator from $X$ to $Y$. And $K$ is a compact operator from $X$ to $Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are both Banach spaces, and Ran$(A)\subset$ Ran$(K)$. Then $A$ is also a compact operator. I tried to use the definition of a compact operator to solve this one. (Indeed, the professor only covered the definition of compact operator in class and said that it would be enough for the homework problems.) Here's what I did. I started by choosing a bounded sequence $x_n$ in X and since A is bounded, $A(x_n)$ is also bounded. And from the assumption that $R(A)\subset R(K)$, I conclude that there exist $y_n\in X$, s.t. $K(y_n)=A(x_n)$. Now if I can somehow prove that $y_n$ is bounded in X, I can easily prove the problem by using the compactness of K. But this is exactly the place where I am stuck. Please help me out. Am I going along the right path? Also, I had another problem saying that: If X is infinitely dimensional and K is an compact operator and is one to one, then I-K must not be compact. I proved this one, but didn't really use the assumption that K is one to one. I looked over and over again but couldn't nd where I made the mistake. Here's what I did: Choose any sequence in X that is of norm 1. Then suppose I-K is compact. It follows there must exists a subsequence $x_{n_k}$ that $(I-K)(x_{n_k})$ converges. And since K is compact, there exists a sub-subsequence $x_{n_{k_j}}$ that $K(x_{n_{k_j}})$. Now I claim that in fact $x_{n_{k_j}}$ converges in X. Indeed, $x_{n_{k_j}}=(I-K)(x_{n_{k_j}})+K(x_{n_{k_j}})$. Hence, for any sequence on the unit sphere, I've found a subsequence that converges. This means the unit sphere is compact, which contradicts with X being infinitely dimensional. Did I do something wrong?","['compact-operators', 'functional-analysis']"

""It'd be nice to relate this formula with the natural mapping $U_{mn} \to U_m \times U_n$ by proving that the kernel has size $d$ and the image has index $\varphi(d)$."" Here, $U_k$ denotes the group of units of the ring $\mathbb{Z} / k \mathbb{Z}$ whenever $k$ is a positive integer. I'm trying to prove the formula
$$
  \varphi(mn) = \varphi(m)\varphi(n) \frac{d}{\varphi(d)}

by considering the natural map $\eta\colon U_{mn} \to U_m \times U_n$ (i.e. the map sending $\overline{x} \mapsto (\overline{x},\overline{x})$, where the bar denotes reduction mod $mn$, $m$, or $n$, respectively). I've been able to show that the kernel has the right size as follows: The kernel of $\eta$ consists of the elements $\overline{x} \in U_{mn}$ with $x \equiv 1 \bmod m$ and $x \equiv 1 \bmod n$.
The integers $x$ which satisfy these conditions are those of the form $x = \frac{mn}{d}k + 1$ for $k \in \mathbb Z$.
On the other hand, any such integer $x$ is relatively prime to $mn$, and hence gives and element $\overline{x} \in U_{mn}$.
Therefore, $\ker \eta$ consists of the $d$ distinct elements $\overline{x}$, where $x = \frac{mn}{d}k + 1$ and $k \in \{1,\ldots,d\}$. Once it has been shown that the image has index $\varphi(d)$, the first isomorphism theorem gives
$$
  \frac{U_{mn}}{\ker \eta} \cong Im(\eta),

$$

$$
  \varphi(mn) = \varphi(m)\varphi(n) \frac{d}{\varphi(d)}.
$$ I'm having trouble showing the image has the right index. I've noticed that $\eta(\overline{x}) = \eta(\overline{x + \frac{mn}{d}})$, so the image consists the images of the elements $\overline{x}$ with $1 \leq x < \frac{mn}{d}$.

This question is closely related to my previous one here . I am considering the two rings $k[X]=k[x,y,z]/\langle xy,xz,yz\rangle$ and $k[Y]=k[x,y]/\langle xy(x-y)\rangle$. The question is if $X\subseteq\mathbb{C}^3$ and $Y\subseteq\mathbb{C}^2$ are isomorphic as schemes, and a hint is to define and compute the tangent space of such a scheme at the origin. If I regard $X$ as an affine scheme $\operatorname{Spec}k[X]$, and if $\mathcal{O}_X$ is its structure sheaf, then the origin 'is' the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}=\langle x,y,z\rangle\subseteq k[X]$. Then $\mathcal{O}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}\cong k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$, which is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}:=\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}=\mathfrak{p}k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$. I can then define the tangent space of $X$ at the origin as the dual space of $\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{m}_{X,\mathfrak{p}}^2$ I guess. But what is the standard procedure to compute such tangent spaces? Can one do this without 'computing' the ring $k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$ first (maybe by finding a basis of the tangent space by looking at $\mathfrak{m}$ directly)? In any case I would like to know what $k[X]_\mathfrak{p}$ and $k[Y]_{\langle x,y\rangle}$ are, but as usual I can't think of a way to 'simplify' these. Does it ever help that localization commutes with taking quotients in actual computations like these? The maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ consists of fractions $\frac{f}{g}$, where $f\in\mathfrak{p},g\notin\mathfrak{p}$, i.e. where $f$ doesn't have a constant term while $g$ has a non-zero one. $\mathfrak{m}^2$ has as generators products of two elements of the above form, in particular the numerator has only degree-2 or higher terms. So elements in the quotient have a numerator with only degree-1 terms? This would be consistent with the naive $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2=\mathfrak{p}_\mathfrak{p}/(\mathfrak{p}_\mathfrak{p})^2=(\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^2)_\mathfrak{p}$, from which I don't really know if I am allowed to calculate like this. As you can see, I'm confused ;) Answers to the various questions above would be very much appreciated, as wells as hints on how to go on with computing the tangent space, and on how to compute the local rings above. My (very vague) guess would be that we get a basis of the dual of the tangent space of $X$ at the origin by taking $x/1,y/1,z/1$, hence a 3-dimensional vector space, which for $Y$ can never happen, as this should be the only way to show $X$ and $Y$ are not isomorphic via tangent spaces at a certain point!? But I could also be totally wrong here. Edit: Again, I forgot the geometry: Can I guess from the geometric picture ($X$ is the union of the three coordinate axes in $\mathbb{C}^3$, while $Y$ consists of the two coordinate axes plus the line $y=x$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$) what the tangent spaces at these two (clearly singular) points should be?

120069,Space filling with circles of unequal radii,"Here is my problem: I have a bunch of circles that I need to display inside a canvas. There are an arbitrary number of circles, each with a predefined radius. The summed area of circles is always smaller than the area of the canvas. I want to position the circles so that they take up the maximal space available inside the canvas, without touching each other. Here is an example of what I am trying to achieve: I am unsure about how to model the algorithm to solve this problem. Specifically, I don't understand which function(s) I need to maximize to find the maximum of the ""global"" inter-circle distance function. I am not even sure if that's the right criterion to maximize to achieve a ""balanced"" result. My first ""brute force"" idea was the following: For each circle: Calculate the shortest distances between its border and each other circle's border. Sum all of these distances (call that X). Calculate the sum of all circles' X. Randomly change the distances between the circles, with the constraint that they can't touch each other. Redo 1-3 for a preset number of iterations and take the maximal value obtained at step (2). However, this does not seem ""elegant"" from a mathematical perspective; I'm sure there is a better way to do it.

For these it is possible to find an asymptotic expansion of the symbol in terms of positively homogeneous functions. So, according to the notes that I am reading we say that a pseudodifferential operator $A \in \Psi^m$ is classical if the symbol $\sigma_A(x, \xi)$ admits an asymptotic expansion \begin{equation}
\sigma_A(x,\xi) \backsim \sum_{k \geq 0} a_{m - k} \, (x,\xi) \qquad (|\xi| \to \infty)

a_{m - k}\,\,(x,\lambda \xi) = \lambda^{(m - k)} \,\, a_{m - k}\,\,(x,\xi)\quad \text{for } \lambda > 0

Unfortunately I cannot deduce myself why this is so. If someone could give some hints or details of the reason that would be really helpful, thanks a lot! EDIT: One guess I have is that, instead of the uniqueness of the expansion, what is acutally unique (or well defined in the context of positively homogeneous terms) is the leading homogeneous term $a_m$, i.e. the principal symbol. This is not the case of a general asymptotic expansion, that's why I suppose that this is what the lecture notes are referring to .. might that be a correct interpretation of the comment I mention ?","['operator-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

(3.1) Does the converse of 3.5.13 hold: if $\mathfrak{q}\!\cap\!A\!=\!\mathfrak{p}$, then $\dim(B/\mathfrak{p}B)\!=\!\dim(B/\mathfrak{q})$? I think so. It suffices to show that $\mathfrak{p}B\!\subseteq\!\mathfrak{q}'\!\subseteq\!\mathfrak{q}$ and $\mathfrak{q}'\!\in\!\mathrm{Spec}(B)$ imply $\mathfrak{q}'\!=\!\mathfrak{q}$. Indeed, we have:
$$\begin{array}{r @{\hspace{1mm}} c @{\hspace{1mm}} c @{\hspace{1mm}} c @{\hspace{1mm}} c @{\hspace{1mm}} c @{\hspace{1mm}} c}

So altogether, $F=h^{-1}\circ f\circ g$ is a bijection on the unit disk fixing $0$, so by Schwarz' lemma, $|F(z)|\leq |z|$. Since $F^{-1}$ shares the same property, we have $\vert F^{-1}(F(z))\vert=|z|\leq |F(z)|$, so $|F(z)|=|z|$, so by Schwarz' lemma, $F(z)=cz$ for some $c$. So $F$ is a LFT, and thus $f$ is as well.

Many thanks! PS.  It's probably worth mentioning I have $60-100M worth of transactions, spanning 4 years across several thousand people in total.  So it should be enough records to do something interesting with!","['statistics', 'finance']"
120355,Designing an efficient sampling strategy,"In a Monte Carlo simulation, my goal is to compute an estimate of the mean of a distribution via sampling.
Traditional, straightforward statistics generates samples (via simulation) and computes the mean and variance of the samples, and uses the variance estimate divided by $n$ as an error estimate on the mean.  This all works and produces the desired estimate with error bounds on that estimate. But I know a little more about my problem. Abstracting the details, my simulation is actually picking samples from multiple independent distributions, each with a different probability of being picked.   Think of my sample as having two (or more) urns, each filled with its own distribution of values. Their means and distributions may be the same or completely different... I don't know, and that's why I'm sampling.  But I also don't care about the mean of each urn; at the end I only care about some weighted combination of their means. I can achieve the sampling easily by picking my samples randomly from one urn or the other with the appropriate weight, then computing the mean and variance of the final samples.  This all certainly works. But this is also throwing away a lot of information which may improve my estimates... I have this known stratification in my problem, and the random sampling is throwing that potential information away.  What if the urns have differing variances, and after pulling 100 samples from each, I can see one urn's variance is much higher than the others? Then I should start taking more samples from the high variance urn (and compensating by reducing the weight of each one of those samples.)  But that decision on the variance is in itself sampled, so I shouldn't trust it! In the worst case, I could take two samples and they happen to be identical, my variance estimate for that urn is 0.. but that doesn't mean I should trust that estimate and ignore the urn from now on! So my question is given  multiple distributions $D_i$ with unknown mean and variance each,  and a known set of weights $\alpha_i$, I want to sample values from these $D$ to efficiently form an unbiased estimate of $\sum \alpha_i \bar{D}_i$. In my problem, I'll typically sample 10,000 to 50,000 times, and I may have between 2 and 10,000 sub-distributions.  This may affect strategy, since I sometimes have so many distributions I can't even afford one sample for every one of them.. some have to be skipped! My current plan will work but it feels ad-hoc. I'll first take say 1000 samples from the distributions, where the number of samples for distribution $D_i$ is proportional to $\alpha_i$.  I'll then compute the estimated variance for each $D_i$ and continue sampling, this time with samples apprortioned proportionally to the measured variance of each $D$.   I think this will work pretty well, but it's not necessarily the most efficient.  And what happens if I have an $\alpha_i$ that's so small that I don't give many (or any) initial samples to the distribution? Should I start combining disparate low-$\alpha$ distributions into one so that they have a better chance of being sampled? My entire goal is to minimize the number of samples needed, but the strategy to apportion them is far from obvious.  Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome!","['statistics', 'monte-carlo', 'sampling', 'probability']"
120359,Not so obvious calculus question,"You have $f \in C^\infty([0,1])$ with $f > 0$. Then $\sqrt{f}$ is easily seen to be differentiable . Prove that there exists a constant $C$ independent of $f$ such that: $$\sup_{x\in[0,1]}\left\lvert \left(\sqrt f\right)'(x)\right\rvert \leq C \left(1 + \sup_{x\in[0,1]}\lvert f(x)\rvert + \sup_{x\in[0,1]}\lvert f'(x)\rvert +  \sup_{x\in[0,1]} \lvert f''(x)\rvert\right).$$ I wonder if someone can give a nice proof of this.","['sobolev-spaces', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

120375,Convergence or divergence of $\sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \left [ \cos(\frac {1} {k^{2}})-\cos(\frac {1} {(k+1)^{2}}) \right ]$,"I am working on a two part question. It asks me to determine whether two different infinite series are divergent or convergent. Here are the two infinite series: (a) $\sum _{i=1}^{\infty} \cos(\frac {1} {i^{2}})$ (b) $\sum _{k=1}^{\infty} \left [ \cos(\frac {1} {k^{2}})-\cos(\frac {1} {(k+1)^{2}}) \right ]$ For part (a) I have determined it is divergent by finding $\lim_{i \to \infty} cos(\frac {1} {i^{2}})=1$ , which shows that the series must be divergent. For part (b) I've found that both terms of the series approach 1 as $k \to \infty$ . This means each term is divergent on its own. This doesn't tell me whether the series is convergent or divergent, it just tells me that the series could be convergent, because $\lim_{k \to \infty}a_{k}=0$ . I am wondering what I can do to get a proper answer.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
120392,Identifying functions equivalent to $y=-3\sin x+2$,"I was given the following problem on a quiz: I put A, C, and D. The answer was A and D. We were taught four relevant equations: $\sin(x)=-\sin(-x)$ $\cos(x)=\cos(-x)$ $\sin(x)=\cos(x-\frac{\pi}{2})$ $\cos(x)=\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{2})$ Based on my understanding of the unit circle definitions of cosine, and the appearance of the graphs of sine and cosine, I assumed: $-\cos(x)=\cos(x\pm\pi)$ That's part of how I got C as an answer. I also graphed my answers after the quiz and they all looked the same. Was my assumption wrong? Is there something I'm missing?
