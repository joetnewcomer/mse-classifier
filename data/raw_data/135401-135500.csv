2141068,Proof of multivariate change of variable technique in statistics,"I am having hard time conceptually grasping how the bivariate change of variable technique works in statistics. The technique can be summarized as follows: Given random variables $X$ and $Y$, and transform of the variables $U=f_1(X)$, $V=f_2(Y)$ the joint distribution of the transformed variables can be found as: $$f_{U,V}(u,v) = f_X(f_1^{-1}(u,v))f_Y(f_2^{-1}(u,v))|J|$$ Where $|J|$ is the determinant of the Jacobian. The inverse has to be single valued. Can anyone provide a detailed proof for why the method works and where the equation comes from?","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'statistics', 'jacobian', 'change-of-variable']"
2141070,Is the hyperboloid model conformal?,"Consider (one sheet of) a hyperboloid of two sheets embedded in Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^3$. There are at least two natural geometric structures on this surface: The intrinsic geometry inherited from the embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane. The hyperboloid sits in a unique cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the geodesics of this model are the intersections of the hyperboloid with Euclidean planes through the apex of the cone. Question: Given two intersecting geodesics in the hyperboloid model, the angle between them can be measured using either of the metrics 1 or 2. Do these two measurements coincide?

2141178,Show that the set $\{1/n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ ⊆ ℝ has Jordan measure zero (content zero),"As per the definition; a subset $A$ of $R^n$ has ($n$-dimensional) content zero if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is a finite cover $\{U_1,...U_n\}$ of A by closed rectangles such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} v(U_i) < \epsilon$. I'm rather stuck on how to show this point. In fact, aside from the idea that the measure of any finite set is also 0, I'm not very sure on techniques for showing something has content zero in generality. My informal progress so far consists of: Consider that the $\lim_{n\to\infty} 1/n$ = 0. So we know that all the points in the set lie inside the set [0,1]. We can reason that there does exist a finite cover of A. We need to show that there exists a finite cover where $m(S) = 0$. An attempt I've tried only seemed to prove that the set has Lebesgue measure zero but not content zero. Consider the cover $\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}[\frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{k}]$. Consider intervals $[\frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{k}]$. Each interval $I_k$ has m($I_k = 0$) and the union completely covers the set. Really stuck on proving it for content zero.

2141187,Choosing stratification variable for stratified sampling,"In general, how do you choose which variable to stratify your sample over? More specifically, what should the proportions look like on the variable your stratifying over?

$$ (b) to interpret (2) combinatorially we use the fact that ${n\brack k}$ is the number of ways of placing $n$ objects in $k$ cycles. if we rewrite $$

From the remaining $n$ objects, select $j \ge m$ . arrange these $j$ objects into $m$ cycles. the $n-j$ unselected objects, together with the object initially set aside,  can be arranged as a cycle in $(n-j)!$ ways.","['stirling-numbers', 'combinatorics']"

2141312,Why the codifferential depends only on the connection (and not the metric)?,"Let $E$ be a vector bundle over a smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Suppose $E$ is equipped with a metric $\eta$ and a metric connection $\nabla$. Denote by $\Omega^k(M,E)$ the space of $E$-valued forms of degree $k$. $\nabla$ induces a covariant exterior derivative $d:\Omega^k(M,E) \to \Omega^{k+1}(M,E)$, which (together with the metrics $g,\eta$) induce the codifferential operator: $\delta:\Omega^k(M,E) \to \Omega^{k-1}(M,E)$. Even though the metric $\eta$ on $E$ plays a part in the definition of $\delta$, it turns out that $\delta$ is actually independent of it, and depends only on the connection $\nabla$ (there is an implicit dependence since $\nabla$ is required to be metric). Indeed, one formula for $\delta$ is $\delta =\star  d \star$ (up to sign), where $\star$ is the Hodge-dual $\Omega^k(M,E) \to \Omega^{d-k}(M,E)$ which is defined without any reference to the metric on $E$. Is there any way to see why the codifferential depends only on the connection $\nabla$ and the metric on $M$, and not on the metric on $E$? Of course, the derivation of the formula above for $\delta$  shows this, but I would like to find an argument without relying on this computation. (I am looking for a more ""conceptual explanation""). Note that it's easy to see from the definition of $\delta$ that it's invariant under scaling of the metric on $E$, however I do not see immediately why it's completely independent of it.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'connections']"

2141568,Can sum of two continuous random variables be discrete?,"Lately I have been asked if there exist any two continuous random variables, whose sum is discrete random variable. Probably the good start is the definition of discrete and continuous random variables. If random variable has property $\sum_{x \in R} P(X=x) = 1$ , the variable is discrete. Random variable is continuous if there exists function $f_X: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ which for each $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , $P(X \in A) = \int_A f_X(x) \ dx$ .

2141623,How to find the primary decomposition of this ideal? How does this fit within the algebro-geometric picture?,"I'm new to classical algebraic geometry and I'm trying to play around with its objects and making examples before diving into the theory itself, just trying to see what is going on. For instance, consider the algebraic variety defined over $\mathbb{R}$ by the equation
\begin{equation}
f(x,y)=y^{3}+2x^{2}y-4y-x=0.
\end{equation} From what I understood so far,  we investigate 'sub-objects' of this algebraic variety by looking at ideals in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$ containing the principal ideal $I=(y^{3}+2x^{2}y-4y-x)$. For example, the maximal ideals of $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$ containing $I$ correspond to the sub-objects points of the variety. More generally, if $J=(f_{1}(x,y),\dots,f_{n}(x,y))$ is an ideal containing $I$, then an solution for the system of equations $f_{1}(x,y)=\dots f_{n}(x,y)=0$ gives a solution for $f(x,y)=0$, and hence this ideal defines some subset of points of the original variety. So, since maximal ideals correspond to points, the natural thing is to wonder what happens inside the algebraic variety for more general prime ideals or even for some other kind of ideals. Is this correct so far? Recall that I'm trying to make first a picture of what algebraic geometry does. Now, from commutative algebra we have the result that in a Noetherian ring, one always has a minimal primary decomposition for an ideal. I want to find the primary decomposition for this specific $I=(y^{3}+2x^{2}y-4y-x)$ to see how this fits within the geometrical picture. How can I do that?

$$g(x,y,z) = (x+3)^2+y^2+(z-1)^2$$ this gives three planes which cross each other on a single line between the points $(0,5,0)$ and $(-3,0,1)$. Is this always the case?

2141794,Infinite Integration by Parts,"A while back, I was explaining to a friend a method to compute the indefinite integral of $\ln(x)$ , by taking $\int \ln(x) \, dx$ and setting $u = \ln(x), du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx, dv = 1 \, dx, v = x$ , then proceeding with integration by parts. However, I was wondering if this method could be generalized for any infinitely differentiable function $f(x)$ , so I attempted the same method. Below is what I computed: $\int f(x) \, dx$ , so let $u = f(x), du = f'(x)\,dx, dv = 1\, dx, v = x \implies$ $x f(x) - \int x f'(x) \, dx$ , so let $u = f'(x), du = f''(x) \, dx, dv = x \, dx, v = \frac{x^2}2 \implies$ $xf(x) - \frac{x^2} 2 f'(x) + \int \frac{x^2}2 f''(x) \, dx$ , so let $u = f''(x), du = f'''(x) \, dx, dv = \frac{x^2} 2 \, dx, v = \frac{x^3} 6 \ldots$ This eventually yields $$\int f(x) \, dx= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} f^{(n-1)}(x),$$ where $f^{(n-1)}(x)$ represents the $(n-1)$ -th derivative of $f(x)$ . At first glance, while this looks like a Taylor expansion, it is actually quite different. Firstly, the general Taylor expansion does not contain the $(-1)^{n-1}$ term that this sum does. Secondly, Taylor expansions are centered around some point, while this sum is not. Finally, and perhaps most notably, in a Taylor expansion, the derivatives are evaluated at a specific point, while in this expansion, they are left as functions. My questions, then, are the following: Is this something new, or has it been documented before? (I've spent a lot of time looking to see if I could find something similar, and so far this has yielded nothing. But, if it has been done, I'd love to read more about it) If this is novel (or even if it is not), what are some of the interesting consequences of this expression? I really do appreciate all of your input and advice. I realize this is a little open ended, but it's been nagging at me for quite some while, and I'd love a second look. Thanks! EDIT: As Alex Kruckman pointed out in the comments, the claim 'this eventually yields' leads to a loss of precision, specifically as it pertains to the $+C$ term in an indefinite integral. After spending some time thinking about this, I noted several remedies to this issue: Rather than express the integral as an infinite sum, we can represent it as a finite sum added to an 'error' term of sorts. In other words, we can say: $$\int f(x)\, dx = \sum_{n=1}^k\left[\frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} f^{(n-1)}(x)\right] + \int \frac{x^k}{k!}(-1)^{k}f^{(k)}(x) \, dx$$ Interestingly, when considering the infinite sum, we note that every term has a polynomial component of at least degree one. This implies that if $x = 0$ , the sum should evaluate to $0$ as well. Therefore, setting $G(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \, dt = F(x) - F(a)$ , we see that as $G(0) = 0$ , $F(0) - F(a) = 0,$ which implies $a = 0$ . In other words, to make my original claim more precise, we can use the definite integral: $$\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} f^{(n-1)}(x)$$ I believe these two edits help to eliminate the problem with the $+C$ term. EDIT 2: I've tried a couple common functions to see how they interact with the formula. Considering $f(x) = e^x$ , we have: $$\begin{aligned}\int e^x \, dx&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1}e^x\\e^x + C &= e^x\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1}\\&= e^x\cdot(1 - e^{-x})=e^x-1\end{aligned}$$ This implies $C = -1$ , a result consistent with the first edit, where we integrate from $0$ to $x$ . Similarly, considering $f(x) = e^{-x}$ , we have: $$\begin{aligned}\int e^{-x} \, dx= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} e^{-x} * (-1)^{(n-1)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} * e^{-x}\\-e^{-x} + C = e^{-x} * \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = e^{-x} * (e^x - 1) = 1 - e^{-x}\end{aligned}$$ This implies $C = 1$ , which we would again get if we integrated from $0$ to $x$ . Now, I decided to consider $f(x) =\ln(x)$ , a decidedly harder function to analyze in this respect, which also is not defined at 0. Here, we have: $$\begin{aligned}\int\ln(x) \, dx&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}(-1)^{n - 1}\frac{d^{(n-1)}}{dx^{(n-1)}}\ln(x)\\x\cdot\ln(x)-x+C&=x\cdot\ln(x)+\sum_{n=2}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} \frac{d^{(n-1)}}{dx^{(n-1)}}\ln(x)\\&=x\cdot\ln(x)-x+C&=x\cdot\ln(x)+\sum_{n=2}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!} (-1)^{n - 1} \frac{(n-2)!}{x^{n-1}}\cdot(-1)^n\\x\cdot\ln(x)-x+C&=x\cdot\ln(x)-\sum_{n=2}^\infty\frac{x}{n(n-1)}\\&=x\cdot\ln(x)-x\end{aligned}$$ Interestingly, here, we see that $C = 0$ . While $ln(x)$ is not defined at $0$ , this intuitively still makes some sense, as we note $\lim\limits_{x\to0} (x\cdot\ln(x) - x) = 0$ .","['taylor-expansion', 'integration', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

2141863,image presheaf is not a sheaf,"Let $\varphi: \mathcal{F}\rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of sheaves, $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}$ are sheaves of abelian groups. For open $U\subseteq X$, define $\text{Im} (\varphi)(U)=\text{Im}(\varphi(U))$. I would like to understand why this is not a  sheaf. Let $V\subseteq U$. Restriction map is given by $\text{Im}(\varphi)(U)\rightarrow \text{Im}(\varphi)(V)$ by restriction. $s\in \text{Im}(\varphi(U))\subseteq \mathcal{G}(U)$ mapsto $s|_V$. It is easy to see that $s|_V\in Im(\varphi)(V)$. $\xymatrix{\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r]^{\varphi(U)}&\mathcal{G}(U)\\ 
 \mathcal{F}(V) \ar[u]^{\text{Res}}\ar[r]^{\varphi(V)}&\mathcal{G}(V) \ar[u]^{\text{Res}}}$ Some how I am not able to draw this commutative diagram. Latex code is correct but here it is not working. Feel free to change this. It is not talking & in the code. Let $x\in \text{Im} (\varphi(U))$ there exists $y\in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that $x=\varphi(U)(y)$. We have 
$$(\varphi(V)\circ \rm{Res})(y)=(\rm{Res}~\circ \varphi(U))(y)$$ i.e., $\varphi(V)(y|_V)=\psi(U)(y)|_V=x|_V$. So, $x|_V\in Im(\varphi(V))$. So, we have a well defined map $\text{Im} (\varphi(U))\rightarrow \text{Im} (\varphi(V))$ given by $x\mapsto x|_V$. commutativity of Restriction map follows from commutativity of restriction map in $\mathcal{G}$. Restriction map from an open set to itself is Identity map. So, $\text{Im}(\varphi)$ is a presheaf. Let $U=\bigcup U_i$ and $s,t\in \text{Im}(\varphi)(U)$ such that $s|_{U_i}=t|_{U_i}$ for all $i$. As $\mathcal{G}$ is a sheaf and $s,t$ can be seen as sections of $\mathcal{G}(U)$ with equal restrictions on each $U_i$ implies $s=t$. Let $U=\bigcup U_i$ and $s_i\in \text{Im}(\varphi)(U_i)$ such that $s_i|{U_i\cap U_j}=s_j|_{U_i\cap U_j}$ for all $i,j$. As $\mathcal{G}$ is a sheaf and $s_i$ can be seen as sections over $\mathcal{G}(U_i)$ with restriction conditions as above, there exists $s\in \mathcal{G}(U)$ such that $s|_{U_i}=s_i$ for all $i$. But the problem is to prove that $s$ is in $\text{Im}(\varphi)(U)$. As $s_i\in \text{Im}(\varphi)(U_i)$ there exists $t_i\in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$ such that $\varphi(U_i)(t_i)=s_i$. Suppose, $s_i|_{U_i\cap U_j}=s_j|_{U_i\cap U_j}$ for all $i,j$ imply that  $t_i|_{U_i\cap U_j}=t_j|_{U_i\cap U_j}$ then, as $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf, there exists $t\in \mathcal{F}(U)$ such that $t|_{U_i}=t_i$ for all $i$. We have $$\varphi(U)(t)|_{U_i}=(\rm{Res}~\circ \varphi(U))(t)=(\varphi(U_i)\circ \rm{Res})(t)=\varphi(U_i)(t|_{U_i})=\varphi(U_i)(t_i)=s_i.$$ So, we have $\varphi(U)(t)|_{U_i}=s_i=s|_{U_i}$ for all $i$. By identity axiom of sheaf, we then have $\varphi(U)(t)=s$ i.e., $s\in \text{Im}(\varphi)(U)$ and we are done. My questions are : Is this justification prove that Image assignment is actually sheaf with the extra assumption that I made that restrictions of $t_i$ have same condition as that of restrictions of $s_i$. Can we construct an  example where this condition fails and Is the sheafification of Image presheaf somehow related to adding this extra condition?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2141913,Brunaldi -- Question 2.30 Circular Permutations -- Another Participant Frees Problem Constraint,"We are to seat five boys, five girls, and one parent in a circular arrangement around a table. In how many ways can this be done if no boys is to sit next to a boy and no girl is to sit next to a girl? What if there are two parents? I've attempted to solve the question above. I cannot solve the second part. Here is my approach to the first part: The total number of circular permutations is obtained by multiplying together the total number of ways to arrange the boys, the girls, and the parent(s). Since no boys can be adjacent, each boy is necessarily separated by someone, either a parent or a girl. B _ B _ B _ B _ B _ The same is true of the girls in this problem. So we place them between the boys: B G B G B G B G B G Assuming for now that the arrangement takes place on a straight line, since we can permute the boys and girls, we have 5! * 5! ways of arranging the boys and girls (5! for each). This over-counts the total number of arrangements, however, since given any arrangement, we can rotate the table in 5 different ways to obtain a different linear arrangement. Thus we have $5!5!/5$ ways of arranging all the participants. The addition of one parent allows for, given any one arrangement, 10 additional ones. Thus we have $2*5!^{2}$ ways to arrange the first setup. What about the second? I've had no luck -- the most difficult consideration is that the introduction of a second parent frees the need of our first construction for boys and girls to interleave each other.",['combinatorics']

2142437,"Is there a ""logical algebraic geometry"" based on provability rather than truth?","I have been taking a course in Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. I have essentially no logical background, but I noticed a striking - although possibly only superficial - similarity between the concept of enumeration of a relation by a formula in a theory and the concept of algebraic varieties being the solutions of polynomial equations. We say a relation $R\subset \mathbb{N}^r$ is enumerated by an $r+1$-place formula $F(v_1, \dots, v_{r+1})$ in a formal system $S$ iff the following holds: If $(n_1,\dots, n_r)\in R$ then there exists $m\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $S\vdash F(n_1, \dots, n_r, m)$; If $(n_1,\dots, n_r)\notin R$ then for every $m\in\mathbb{N}$, $S\vdash \sim F(n_1, \dots, n_r,m)$. This bears a similarity to the case for algebraic varieties, where if $X$ is a hypersurface over any field $k$ (or more generally, perhaps, a scheme) defined by the vanishing of the polynomial $f\in k[x_1, \dots, x_r]$ then for a point $P$ in the larger ambient space, $$P\in X \iff f(P)=0.$$ There is an important distinction between these cases, however. The case for enumeration is not an ""if and only if"" statement, as in the case for algebraic geometry; as far as I understand, this is because we're talking about provability of the negation of a formula rather than the negation of provability of a formula (i.e. that the formula is not provable). This seems clearer when e.g. we take $$F(v_1, \dots, v_{r+1}):= (f(v_1, \dots, v_r) = v_{r+1}).$$ Then $P = (n_1, \dots, n_r)\in X$ (for the geometry case) if and only if $F(P,0)$ is true , whereas $P\in R$ (for the relation case) if and only if $F(P,0)$ is provable in $S$. Despite these distinctions, it's made me wonder whether this is all just wishful thinking or whether there is some theory of ""provability geometry"" in the sense that a point $P$ belongs to some kind of ""logical geometric object"" $X$ when the algebraic formula $f(P) = 0$ is replaced by a logical formula $S\vdash F(P)$ i.e. some kind of ""duality"" between provability and geometry. Perhaps this can be established using a type of functor of points idea from some category encoding proof-theoretical data into the category of sets. If such a thing exists, Is it a useful thing to study? Does it shed light on any problems, either in algebraic geometry, number theory or logic? Do formulas that cannot be proved have any interpretation in this geometric context? How does the formal system $S$, and possible replacement of $\mathbb{N}$ with another ""environment"" (due to my ignorance of logic I'm being a bit vague here) influence such objects? I would be very grateful for references to anything in a similar vein to this idea. I would also be grateful if anyone can dispel this as idealism!","['reference-request', 'logic', 'algebraic-geometry', 'proof-theory']"

2142638,Compute $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp(-x)(\cos(x))^n dx$,"In the context of a measure theory and Lebesgue integration course I have to compute the limit $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{1}^{\infty} \exp(-x)(\text{cos}(x))^n dx $$ To me this looks like the application of some convergence theorem, either the dominated or monotone one. I first checked some general properties relating to the convergence theorems: Pointwise convergence: Since $\vert \text{cos}(x) \vert \leq 1$ , it holds that $\vert (\text{cos}(x))^n \vert \leq 1 \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Hence I know that for the pointwise limit holds that $$-\exp(-x) \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \exp(-x) (\text{cos}(x))^n \leq \exp(-x)$$ But what can I infer about pointwise convergence from this? Since cosine oscillates between 1 and -1 there seems to be no pointwise limit. But there has to be in order to apply either one of the convergence theorems. So what do I miss here? Dominating function: Let's apply the dominated convergence theorem. For this we need a non-negative function $g \in L(\lambda)$ for which it holds that $$\vert f_n(x) \vert \leq g(x) \quad \forall x \in [1,\infty),\quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$$ . Obviously, a good candidate is $g(x) = \exp(-x)$ since it is non-negative and $$\int_{[1,\infty)} \vert\exp(-x)\vert d\lambda(x) < \infty$$ Now we can apply the dominated convergence theorem and write $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp(-x) (\text{cos}(x))^n = \int_{0}^{\infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \exp(-x) (\text{cos}(x))^n d\lambda(x)$$ Now all I need to do is evaluate the actual limit $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \exp(-x) (\text{cos}(x))^n$$ but I don't see it since $(\text{cos(x)})^n$ jumps back and forth for $\lim_{n \to \infty}$ .","['lebesgue-integral', 'limits']"
2142651,What are the epimorphisms and monomorphisms in the category of affine varieties?,"I have a naive question on algebraic geometry.

This give under the anti-equivalence of categories a k-algebra morphism $\phi^*$ between coordinate algebras of $Y$ and $X$. However, $\phi^*$ injective doesn't imply $\phi$ surjective. Think for example to the projection of the hyperbola $XY=1$ to the $X$-axis. Shouldn't the anti-equivalence of categories force a correspondence between injective and surjective morphisms?
It must be that surjective morphism of affine varieties are not the epimorphisms in the categorical sense, but I don't understand why? I know that for finite morphisms for instance, we have this correspondence.

2142653,Equivalent definitions of purely finitely additive measures,"I'm studying finitely additive measures and have come across the following definition.

Formally, I'm fine with this definition, but I feel I'm lacking intuition about it. I had expected a purely finitely additive measure to be a finitely additive measure that is not countably additive. That is, if $\mu$ is purely finitely additive, I expected that there exists a countably infinite disjoint sequence $\{ A_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\mu(A_n) < \mu(A)$, where $A = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_n$.

2142660,A problem with four circles and a square,"I was doing random things when I noticed something which seemed strange to me. What I did was the following. Take two points $A$ and $C$ of the plane. We denote $\ell$ the distance $AC$ . Draw a circle $\mathscr C_0$ of center $A$ and radius $r_0$ . Then define $M_0$ to be a point of $\mathscr C_0$ , and $M_1$ the middle of $[M_0C]$ . Finally, define $M_2$ and $M_3$ such that $M_0M_1M_2M_3$ is square. It should look like something like this: Then we are interested in the trajectory of $M_1$ , $M_2$ and $M_3$ when $M_0$ move along the circle $\mathscr C_0$ . We notice that every $M_i$ seems to move on a circle $\mathscr C_i$ of a unique radius $r_i$ . But I don't get why this would be true, which leads us to the first questions: Question 1. Are all trajectories $\mathscr C_i$ circles? Question 2. What are the radius $r_i$ in terms of $\ell$ and $r_0$ ? Question 3. Where are located the centers of those circles? What I noticed is that if the radius $r_0$ changes, we still get three other circles, and they are all concentric: And this is the case even when $r_0\geqslant \ell$ : It looks like this if $r_0$ varies continuously: What I did to try to find the centers (since all three circles seems to have the same three centers for different radius $r_0$ ) is to see what it would look like with $r_0$ really small: So the centers seems to be: the middle point $A_1$ of $[AC]$ , the two points $A_2$ , $A_3$ such that $AA_1A_2A_3$ is a square.","['circles', 'geometry']"

(5 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I'm just learning about differential equation separability. I understand what a derivative is. One notation for derivative is $\frac{dy}{dx}$, which - misleadingly - is not a fraction. Since it's not a fraction, why are we ""separating"" differential equations by treating it as if it were a fraction? For example: We have the following differential equation: $$\frac{dy}{dx} = y.$$ Then we separate the... whatever they are: $$\frac{dy}{y} = x\cdot dx.$$ What do $dy$ and $dx$ even represent when they are detached from each other? How is this valid math? Then we integrate both sides of the equation. Even though we are integrating one side with $dy$ and the other side with $dx$, the equality is somehow magically not broken. Also, somehow integrating $dy$ yields $y$, but integrating $dx$ doesn't yield $x$.

Definition (Path Connectedness) : A space $X$ is said to be path connected if every pair of points can be joined by a path in $X$. My Attempted Proof We have clearly that $S^0 = \{-1, 1\}$. I assert that $S^0$ is path connected in the trivial topology $\mathcal{T} = \{ \emptyset, \{-1, 1\}\}$. Pick $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $b \not\in \mathbb{Q}$.

for $x \in [a, b]$, then $f$ is clearly continuous as $f^{-1}\left[\{-1, 1\}\right] = [a, b]$ which is open in the subsace topology.

I am not much acquainted with the Laplace method or probabilistic interpretations (I'd appreciate it some references are mentioned, should the answer involve advanced tools like them.) Machinato suggests that $f(z)=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n z^{n-1}}{n! \log n}$ approaches $\log z$. This seems to be true! As evidence, here are plots of the real (red) and imaginary (blue) parts of $f(e^{2+i \theta})$, for $-\pi<\theta<\pi$. For comparison, the red and blue dashed lines are the real and imaginary parts of $\log z = 2+i \theta$. It's not clear from this image whether the limit holds for all $\theta$, but for $-\pi/2 < \theta < \pi/2$ the fit is very good. I'm offering a bounty for a proof of this bizarre behavior. I imagine the precise formulation is that, for $\theta$ fixed in $(-\pi,\pi)$, we have $\lim_{R \to \infty} f(R e^{i \theta}) - \log R = i \theta$ but I'll certain accept other asymptotic results of a similar flavor.

2143483,Doubly transitive subgroup of $S_n$,"I have a basic question about doubly transitive subgroups of $S_n$. Let $G$ be a doubly transitive subgroup of $S_n$ such that $G$
  contains a simple transposition. Why does it follow that $G=S_n$? This fact is freely used in the article ""Galois groups of enumerative problems"" by Joe Harris, but without any reference. So I assume that it is a relatively straightforward fact, but a proof is evading me. Let me recall few definitions for the sake of context. If a group $G$ acts on a set $X$, the action of $G$ on $X$ is called transitive if for every $x, y\in X$, there exists $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x=y$. The action is called doubly transitive if for any two pairs $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$ with $x\neq y$ and $x'\neq y'$, there is a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x = x'$ and $g\cdot y=y'$. In other words, we can use an element of $G$ to move any distinct pair to any distinct pair. Some authors use the terminology 2-transitive for this concept. So, when we say a doubly transitive subgroup of $S_n$ , we are thinking of the natural action of the subgroup on $n$ letters (or symbols, etc.), say $X=\{1, 2, ..., n\}$. This is an action ""inherited"" from $S_n$. Finally, a simple transposition just means a permutation on $X$ that switches $i$ and $j$ ($i\neq j$) but fixes everything else.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-actions', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"

$$dA = -I_{n\times n}$$

$$df|_p = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} dx_i|_p$$
which means $df$ is a cotangent vector (or called one form). 
Now if $f: M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$, by calculation, I think $df$ would be a matrix
$$df_{ij} = \frac{\partial \pi_i\circ f}{\partial x_j},$$ 
is there a special name for this $df$? And should I think of it as a tensor product between a cotangent vector on $M$ and a cotangent vector on $R^k$ 
$$df_{ij} = \frac{\partial \pi_i\circ f}{\partial x_j}dr_i\otimes dx_j?$$ (so that I can generalize this to $f:M\rightarrow N$, but this would be a (2,0) tensor on two different manifolds...) Here we have the antipodal $A:S^n \rightarrow S^n$, suppose we use the standard stereographic projection as our coordinate system, then the coordinate map $\phi$ on $S^n/\{n\}$ would be
$$(x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1}) \mapsto \left(\frac{x_1}{1-x^n},\cdots \frac{x_n}{1-x^{n+1}}\right)$$

$$(y_1, \cdots ,y_{n}) \mapsto \left(\frac{2y_1}{1+|y|^2},\cdots \frac{-1+|y|^2}{1+|y|^2}\right)$$

I made three proofs for this. See these proofs below. (Whoever has a more cool proof, please share.) Weitzenbock's inequality. Let $a$ , $b$ , $c$ be the sides of the triangle, and let $A$ be its area. Then: $$a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\;\geq\;4\sqrt{3}\;A$$ Proof 1 Let $R$ the circunradius. Suppose, by contradiction, that: \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}<\frac{3}{R\sqrt{3}} \tag{1}
\end{equation} Using that: \begin{equation}
a+b+c\leq 3R\sqrt{3} \tag{2}
\end{equation} Multiplying (1) e (2): $$(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)<9$$ What is absurd, this can be seen using the inequality that relates the arithmetic mean to the harmonic mean, or by the inequality of Cauchy-Schwarz. From where we conclude: \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\geq\frac{3}{R\sqrt{3}}
\end{equation} Using $\displaystyle A=\frac{abc}{4R}$ , we get: $$ab+ac+bc\geq \frac{\sqrt{3}abc}{R}$$ $$ab+ac+bc\geq 4A\sqrt{3}$$ This result follows using that $\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\geq ab+bc+ac$ Proof 2 By Heron we get: \begin{equation*}
    a^2+b^2+c^2 \geq 4\sqrt{3} \sqrt{S(S-a)(S-b)(S-c)}
\end{equation*} Multiplying both sides of the inequality above by $\displaystyle \sqrt{\left(\frac{a+b+c}{2abc}\right)^2}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{S}{abc}\right)^2}$ , : \begin{equation*}
    \left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)\left(\frac{a+b+c}{2abc}\right) \geq 4\sqrt{3} \sqrt{\frac{S(S-a)}{bc}\frac{S(S-b)}{ac}\frac{S(S-c)}{ab}}
\end{equation*} By the law of cosine and law of sine we have: \begin{equation*}
    \left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)\left(\frac{a+b+c}{2abc}\right) \geq 4\sqrt{3} \cos\frac{\alpha}{2}\cos\frac{\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\gamma}{2}

 \end{equation*} And this inequality follows from the Jensen inequality. Proof 3 Let $\displaystyle R$ the circunradius, $\displaystyle \alpha, \beta, \gamma$ the opposite acute angles to the sides of $\displaystyle a, b, c$ , so: $\\ \\ \displaystyle a^2+b^2-c^2=\frac{4Rabc(a^2+b^2-c^2)}{4Rabc}=\frac{4AR(a^2+b^2-c^2)}{abc}=4A\times\frac{2R}{c}\times\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}=4Acot\gamma=4A\sqrt{cot^2\gamma}=4A\sqrt{csc^2\gamma-1}=4A\sqrt{\frac{4R^2}{c^2}-1}=4A\sqrt{\frac{4a^2b^2R^2}{a^2b^2c^2}-1}=4A\sqrt{\frac{a^2b^2}{4\left(\frac{abc}{4R}\right)^2}-1}=4A\sqrt{\frac{a^2b^2}{4A^2}-1}=2\sqrt{4A^2\left(\frac{a^2b^2}{4A^2}-1\right)}=2\sqrt{a^2b^2-4A^2}\Rightarrow a^2+b^2-c^2=2\sqrt{a^2b^2-4A^2}\\ \\$ By symmetry, we get: \begin{equation*}
 2\sqrt{a^2b^2-4A^2}=a^2+b^2-c^2

2\sqrt{b^2c^2-4A^2}=b^2+c^2-a^2

4\sqrt{a^2b^2-4A^2}\sqrt{a^2c^2-4A^2}=(a^2+c^2-b^2)(a^2+b^2-c^2)
\end{equation*} We know that $\displaystyle m+n\geq 2\sqrt{mn}$ , it folows that: \begin{equation*}
 2(a^2b^2-4A^2+b^2c^2-4A^2)\geq (a^2+b^2-c^2)(b^2+c^2-a^2)

Next, we have a function $g:\mathbb{Z}^2 \rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, which shows how many grains are in the point $(x,y).$ Also, there is a number of a maximum possible grains in a point which leaves point stable. We will denote this number through $T$ (threshold). Now execute the following algorithm: if $g(x,y) > T$ then subtract 4 grains from $(x,y)$ and add one grain to each neighbor of $(x,y)$ i.e. $(x\pm 1, y)$ and $(x, y\pm 1)$. if there is no points with $g(x,y) > T$ then terminate. Else, start with step 1. Simple example with $T=4$ and starting amount of grains $S$ (seed) at $(2,2)$ equals to 11 showed below.

My question is Given a sandpile $\Delta(n_0;t)$ find the size of this sandpile, where $$\text{size} := |\Delta(n_0;t)| =\max_{g(x,y)>0}|x|=\max_{g(x,y)>0}|y|$$ Tries Some reasons lead me to the answer
$$|\Delta(n_0;t)| \leq 3\log_{4}\frac{n_0}{t} + 1,$$
but empirical results say that for sufficiently large $n_0$ it is not true. Pictures Here are some pictures I made with Sage. The darker color the more grains in pixel. The first three pictures with threshold equals to 4, two last - 3.

It is almost obvious how they (1-dim SP's) look like (take a guess). More over, one can calculate the size of 1-dim SP:

If such a measure existed, it would mimic the notion of drawing a ""random integer"" from all of $\mathbb{N}$, at least with respect to these divisibility properties. 1) and 2) hold approximately for the uniform distribution on $\mathbb{N} \cap [1,X]$ for large $X$; a similar weakening of the question is to use asymptotic density, i.e. define $\mu(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{|A \cap \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}|}{n}$, which satisfies 1) and 2) but is not countably additive. The zeta distribution, given by (for any $s > 1$) the density $\nu_s(n) = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)} n^{-s}$, comes very close: it is an easy check that 2) holds, but $\nu_s(A_n) = n^{-s}$ for all $n$. (Interestingly, as $s \to 1^+$, for a fixed subset $A \subset \mathbb{N}, \nu_s(A)$ converges to the asymptotic density of $A$, if it exists.) I suspect the answer is that no such measure exists: the fact that the zeta distribution fails makes me think 1 and 2 are somehow at odds. I believe any $\mu$ satisfying 1) and 2) should have $\mu(\mathbb{N}) = \infty$, but I don't have a proof. Thanks! Edit: As people have pointed out, 1) clearly implies 2). (Whoops!) And @Zhoraster has given a nice proof that no measure can exist in this case. Here's what (I think) will be a harder question: Can we find a measure $\mu$ satisfying 1a) $\mu(A_p) = 1/p$ for primes $p$, and 2a) The events $A_p$ and $A_q$ are independent when $p$ and $q$ are prime. Now it's not obvious that $1$ and $2$ hold for products of many primes: we do get $\mu(A_{pq}) = 1/pq$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$, but that's it. I don't think the inclusion-exclusion proof will work as stated, but perhaps a similar idea can be used...","['probability', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2143787,An Application of Functional Monotone Class Theorem to Conditional Expectation,"I'm proving the next proposition:
Let $X$ be a random variable defined over a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ which takes values on $(E,\mathcal{E}),$ $\mathcal{G}$ a $\sigma-$algebra generated by a denumerable family $(Y_{n})_{n\geq1},$ which take values on $(Y,\mathcal{Y}),$ and let $f$ be a measurable real function, bounded or positive. A random variable $U$ $\mathcal{G}-$measurable is a version of the conditional expectation of $f(X),$ given $\mathcal{G},$ if 
$$E(f(X)\prod_{i=1}^{n}f_{k}(Y_{k}))=E(U\prod_{i=1}^{n}f_{k}(Y_{k})),$$  for every $n\geq 1$ and $f_{1}\ldots f_{n}$ functions $\mathcal{Y}-$measurable positive or bounded. My idea is work with functional monotone class theorem. To do this, let $H$ be the set of all $U-\mathcal{G}$ measurables such that satisfie the equation of the proposition. I want to prove that $H$ is a linear vector space, but I have troubles proving the closedness because the sum of two elements in $H$ doesn't belong. The same with product by a element. Any kind of help is thank in advance.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'measure-theory']"

\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{\pi/2- \arctan(1/x^2)-\sin(x^3)-1+\cos(x)}{x\tan(x)+e^{x^3}-1}
$$ I separated the numerator so I got that $$\dfrac{-1+\cos(x)}{x\tan(x)+e^{x^3}-1} \longrightarrow -\dfrac{1}2;$$ I know that the limit is $\dfrac{1}2$ and I know, by checking on Wolfram Alpha , that $$\dfrac{-\sin(x^3)}{x\tan(x)+e^{x^3}-1}\longrightarrow 0$$ so $$\dfrac{π/2- \arctan(1/x^2)}{x\tan(x)+e^{x^3}-1} \longrightarrow 1.$$ I tried using L'Hopital but it gets even more complicated.

2143812,Has the mean number decreased?,"This question is from a book. In 1970 the average number of children per family in a certain town was 3.8. In 1980 a random sample of 40 families had a total of 144 children. At the 5pc level of significance is there evidence to conclude that the mean number of children per family had decreased? I want to use this formula: $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}=\frac{3.6-3.8}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{40}}}$ The book says ""Yes"" and gives a z-value answer of -0.2108. I could not figure out the standard deviation from the problem. Is it there?","['statistics', 'sampling', 'hypothesis-testing']"
