1367901,Countably Infinitely Many Points in a Euclidean Space with Restraining Orders,"Update. The answer to the main question for $d\geq 3$ is positive.  For $d=1$ , it is easy to show that the answer is negative.  What is the answer for $d=2$ ? Main Question. Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of positive integers.  Do there exist $d\in\mathbb{N}$ such that there are pairwise distinct
points $x_1$ , $y_1$ , $x_2$ , $y_2$ , $\ldots$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such
that (i) $\left\|x_i-y_i\right\|_2 >1$ for every $i\in\mathbb{N}$ , (ii) $\left\|x_i-y_j\right\|_2<1$ for all $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $i\neq j$ , (ii) $\left\|x_i-x_j\right\|_2<1$ and $\left\|y_i-y_j\right\|_2<1$ for all $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$ ? Here, $\|\bullet\|_2$ is the usual Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Alternative Interpretation. Let $a_1$ , $a_2$ , $a_3$ , $\ldots$ and $b_1$ , $b_2$ , $b_3$ , $\ldots$ be two countably infinite collections of people.  Suppose that $a_i$ and $b_i$ have a restraining order against one another for every $i=1,2,3,\ldots$ .  No other pair of people has a restraining order.  However, each person is friends with every other persons except the one against whom they have a restraining order.  For a fixed dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ , is it possible to arrange these people in the $d$ -dimensional Euclidean space so that the distance between each pair of friends is less than $1$ , but the distance between each pair with a restraining order is greater than $1$ ? This question is based on Graph theory-related problem, unit distance graph, pairs of people with restraining orders .  If we require finitely many points, the answer is positive.  If we require uncountably many points, the answer is negative.  Hence, I wonder what happens if there are countably infinitely many points. Related Question: Let $J$ be an index set.  For a given cardinality of $J$ , do there exist pairwise distinct
points $x_i$ and $y_i$ for $i\in J$ in the real Hilbert space $\ell^2(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R})$ such
that (i) $\left\|x_i-y_i\right\|_2 >1$ for every $i\in J$ , (ii) $\left\|x_i-y_j\right\|_2<1$ for all $i,j\in J$ such that $i\neq j$ , (ii) $\left\|x_i-x_j\right\|_2<1$ and $\left\|y_i-y_j\right\|_2<1$ for all $i,j\in J$ ? Here, $\|\bullet\|_2$ is the usual $2$ -norm on $\ell^2(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R})$ . Attempt at the Main Question. Suppose that $S:=\big\{x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\ldots\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies the required properties above.  We observe that $S$ is a bounded set, whence, due to the Heine-Borel Theorem, its topological closure $\bar{S}$ is compact, making it also sequentially compact.  Therefore, the sequence $\left\{x_i\right\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ has a subsequence $\left\{x_{i_j}\right\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging to a point $u$ in $\bar{S}$ .  Now, the sequence $\left\{y_{i_j}\right\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ has a subsequence $\left\{y_{i_{j_k}}\right\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging to a point $v\in\bar{S}$ .  We denote $u_k$ for $x_{i_{j_k}}$ and $v_k$ for $y_{i_{j_k}}$ for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ .  Hence, $\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty}\,u_k=u$ and $\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty}\,v_k=v$ . Note that $\left\|u_i-v_i\right\|_2 >1$ and $\left\|u_i-v_j\right\|_2<1$ for all $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $i \neq j$ .  Thus, $$\left\|u-v_j\right\|_2=\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty}\,\left\|u_k-v_j\right\|_2\leq 1 \text{ and }\left\|u_i-v\right\|=\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty}\,\left\|u_i-v_k\right\|_2\leq 1$$ for all $i,j \in \mathbb{N}$ . Ergo, $\|u-v\|_2=\displaystyle\lim_{j\to\infty}\,\left\|u-v_j\right\|_2\leq 1$ .  However, $$\|u-v\|_2=\displaystyle\lim_{i\to\infty}\,\left\|u_i-v_i\right\|_2\geq 1\,.$$ That is, $\|u-v\|_2=1$ .","['euclidean-geometry', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry', 'hilbert-spaces', 'combinatorics']"

I have to proof that there is a chart $(\varphi=(u_1,\dots,u_m), U)$ with $\varphi(p)=0$ and:$$ \xi_i =\left( \frac{d}{du_i}\right)_p$$ -My approach: Let $(\varphi, U)$ be a chart with $\varphi(p)=0$, there is an unique linear endomorphism $F$ of $\text{T}_pM$ that sends (since both sets are bases), $$\left( \frac{d}{du_i}\right)_p\longrightarrow \xi_i$$

  been a total of $5$ failures. If T is the time at which the test ends,
  find $E[T]$ and $Var(T)$. I'm stuck in this exercise. If $T$ is the time at which test ends, then $T$ is the time of fifth failure, suppose $T_i$ for $i=1,2,3,4,5$ are the times that the five failures occurred, how I can find the distribution of each $T_i$? In a previous exercise I saw that the failure rate is $$r(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}$$
this means that failure time is a exponential random variable with parameter $r(t)$? EDIT: The answer of @Did in this post rate parameter seems to have a relationship with what I'm asking, the failure time has no distribution?","['self-learning', 'probability', 'stochastic-processes']"
1367941,Function of the trajectory of a differential equation,"I want to show that there is no continuously differentiable non-constant function $H : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\nabla H(x,y) \neq (0,0)$ so that for every solution of the differential equation $\dot x = -x , \dot y = -2y :$ $H(x(t),y(t)) = c, c \in \mathbb{R}$ holds. The solution of the differential equation is $x(t) = e^{-t}, y(t) = e^{-2t}$, then if $H$ is such a function: $d/dt H(e^{-t}, e^{-2t}) = -\partial_xH(e^{-t}, e^{-2t})e^{-t} -\partial_yH(e^{-t}, e^{-2t})2e^{-2t} = 0 $ for all $ t \in \mathbb{R} $.
So we have $-\partial_yH(e^{-t}, e^{-2t})2e^{-t} = \partial_xH(e^{-t}, e^{-2t})$ and for $t \to \infty: \partial_xH(0,0) = 0 $ which is a contradicition to $\nabla H(x,y) \neq (0,0)$. Where am I wrong?","['real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1367971,"If $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$ is bijective, what do we know about $f,g$?","Question: If $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$ as a function $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is bijective, what do we know about $f,g$, which are also functions $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$? Is my proof correct? My attempt: $f$ must be injective. If not, there exist $a,b$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$, but then $f(g(f(a)))=f(g(f(b)))$, which contradicts the fact that $h$ is injective. $f$ must be surjective. If there is a value that is not taken by $f$, then it is certainly not taken by $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$, contradicting that it is bijective. Suppose there exist $a,b$ such that $g(a)=g(b)$. Because $f$ is surjective, $a,b$ are in the range of $f$, and thus there exist $c,d$ such that $g(f(c))=g(f(d))$, and thus $f(g(f(c)))=f(g(f(d)))$, which contradicts the fact that $h$ is injective. Therefore $g$ is injective. Since $f$ is bijective, there is an unique $x$ such that $f(x)=p$. If $x$ is not in the range of $g$, then $p$ is not in the range of $h(x)=f(g(f(x)))$, contradicting that it is surjective. Therefore all real numbers are in the range of $g$, thus $g$ is surjective. Therefore both $f$ and $g$ are bijective. Is this proof correct?","['functional-equations', 'proof-verification', 'functions']"

$$ Intuitively, I believe this should be true since it is a sort of ""limit"" of convex combinations of elements of $C$.

This seems like something that would pop up in some handy reference, or failing that, it at least it seems like a standard kind of argument of which someone here could fill in the blanks.

How many possible pairings are there? Here is the same question with a different amount of couples. I read the answers to the linked question but still couldn't get this right. This question was asked in a TV show. It was part of the following problem: Find the name of a car manufacturer. Its second letter is A.

The sum over $i$ is the number of pairings where at least one pair is a married couple. Here it is in WolframAlpha. However the number does not make sense as an ASCII code sequence and it is not even close to the correct answer.

1368399,"For $T\in \mathcal L(V)$, we have $\text{adj}(T)T=(\det T)I$.","Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic $0$. For a linear operator $T\in \mathcal L(V)$, we know that $\bigwedge^n T=(\det T)I$, where $I:V\to V$ is the identity map. Further, from this answer we can define the adjugate of $T$ as $\bigwedge^{n-1}T^t:\bigwedge^{n-1}V^*\to \bigwedge^{n-1}V^*$, where $T^t$ is the transpose of $T$. We write $T^\sharp$ as a shorthand for $\bigwedge^{n-1}T^t$. The Question: It is a well-known formula that if $M$ is an $n\times n$ matrix with entries from a field $F$, then 
$$\text{adj}(M)M=M(\text{adj}(M))=(\det M)I_n$$
where $\text{adj}(M)$ is the adjugate of $M$. I am trying to formulate this fact in the language of linear maps rather than matrices. The problem is that it does not mean anything to take the product of $T^\sharp$ with $T$.

1368402,For which varieties is the natural map from the Chow ring to integral cohomology an injection?,"For a smooth projective complex variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$, there is a natural map from its Chow ring $\mathbb{A}^*(X)$ into even integral cohomology $H^{2*}(X)$ of its (often implicitly identified) analytification. The question of when this is an isomorphism is subtle, but I have two (possibly) simpler questions, neither of which is hopefully ridiculous. First one is pretty quick: isn't it true that while it's obviously difficult for this to be surjective, it is always surjective into the subring of even cohomology representable by closed submanifolds? My understanding is that this is one implication of GAGA; every closed analytic subspace is also a closed algebraic subvariety. My main question, though, is whether the map is always injective - or, at least, if there's nice sufficient (+ necessary would be even better!) conditions for it to be injective. That is, whether a linear combination of closed submanifolds representing 0 in homology implies that the associated algebraic cycle is rationally equivalent to zero. The reverse (proving the map is well-defined) follows nicely from the homotopy-esque definition of rational equivalence given in Fulton, but I can't see any obvious approach here.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

U=U(0,A):=\mathbb{E}\Big[\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathbb{1}_{\{X_t\in A\}}dt\Big].

This can also be estimated using a histogram, treating all values within each bin as the same outcome. Doing this will be possible if we are sampling from a continuous distribution and storing the outcome as floating point numbers. However the estimate we get will be dependent on how we create our histogram bins. It would be nice to get an estimate which is not dependent on how to build histogram bins but still gives a correct estimate for at least some important special cases.

Consider the following problem: Problem 1. Let $M$ and $N$ be $n\times n$ matrices with entries from a field $F$ of characteristic $0$. Then
  $$\det(MN)=\det M\det N\tag{1}$$ The above can be neatly proved using exterior algebras (I have hidden the details of this since this is not important here. Doing this seems to reduce the length of the post. Long posts tend to decrease the number of readers.): We know that given given a linear operator $T$ on an $n$-dimensional vector space based on the field $F$, we have a induced map $\bw^k T:\bw^kV\to \bw^k V$. If $k=n$, then since $\dim(\bw^n V)=1$, we kwow that there is a unique constant $c$ such that $\bw^n T=c I$, where $I$ is the identity map on $\bw^n V$.
It is easily shown that $c$ is same as the determinant of the matrix of $T$ which respect to any basis of $V$. Now if $T, S\in \mathcal L(V)$, then
$$
\det(ST)(v_1\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n)=\bigwedge^n(TS)(v_1\wedge \cdots \wedge v_n)
\\=TS(v_1)\wedge\cdots TS(v_n)=\bw^n T(Sv_1\wedge \cdots \wedge Sv_n)
=\det S\ \bw^n T(v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_n)
\\=\det S\det T(v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_n)
$$ Of course, equation (1) remains true even if we have the entries of $M$ and $N$ coming from a ring. I am not aware of any analog of exterior algebras for arbitrary rings. So I have a workaround. Consider the polynomial ring $A=\R[x_{ij},y_{ij}:\ 1\leq i,j\leq n]$ in $2n^2$ indeteminates $x_{ij}$ and $y_{ij}$. Let $\mc M$ be the $n\times n$ matrix whose $i,j$-th entry is $x_{ij}$ and $\mc N$ be the matrix whose $i, j$-th entry is $y_{ij}$.
Consider the polynomials $P, Q$ and $R$ in $A$ defined as $P=\det(\mc M\mc N)$, $Q=\det \mc M$, and $R=\det \mc N$. Now let $S\in A$ be defined as $P-QR$. We know from (1) that $S$ evaluates to $0$ identically and thus $S$ must be the zero polynomial in $A$. Note that $S$ can be regarded as a polynomial in $Z:=\mathbb Z[x_{ij}, y_{ij}:\ 1\leq i, j\leq n]$. Now suppose we have matrices $M$ and $N$ with entries from a ring $B$. By the universal property of polynomial rings, we have a unique ring homomorphism $f:Z\to B$ which carries $x_{ij}$ to the $i,j$-th entry of $M$ and $y_{ij}$ to the $i,j$-th entry of $N$. Now since $S$ is the zero polynomial, we have $f(S)=0$. But $f(S)=\det(MN)-\det M\det N$. And thus we have proved (1) in the general setting of rings without doing much symbolic computation. Does the above make sense? It seems a bit artificial. Is there a more direct way (of course, apart from playing with symbols). This approach (provided all is well) can be used to prove other similar results. Thanks.","['ring-theory', 'determinant', 'multilinear-algebra', 'polynomials', 'linear-algebra']"

This leads to $x(e^x) = e^x$, $x = 1$ But all of the $M$ values greater than $e$ must yield exactly $2$ solutions. One that is larger than one and the other occurring between $0$ and $1$, (Rolle's theorem) An approximation to a solution for any given $M$ is $\log(M)$, since $\log(M) + \log(x) = x$. This can be improved to give us $\log(M) + \log\log(M) = x$. The error to this approximation is $\log(1 - (\log(x))/(x))$, which rapidly approaches $0$ as $x$ gets larger. The error is this because $\log\log M = \log(x-\log(x)) = \log(x) + \log(1 - \frac{\log(x)}{x})$ Here's what I can't work out, $y = \log M$ has precisely one solution, whereas $y = x - \log(x)$ has two.

1368834,Category of Sets w/ 17 Elements: There does not exist a direct product? (Lots of questions here),"I'm having a pretty hard time with this. I'm asked to show that, in the category of sets with exactly 17 elements , no two objects have either a direct product nor direct sum. Part of me doesn't even believe this statement—but whenever I try to come up with a direct product, I get snagged. Let $(C, \alpha, \beta)$ be a [potential] direct product of $A$ and $B$. Fix some object, $C'$, with mappings, $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$, from $C'$ to $A$ and $B$ respectively. We need a unique $\gamma: C' \rightarrow C$ such that $\alpha \circ \gamma = \alpha'$ and $\beta \circ \gamma = \beta'$. $C = A \times B$ just can't work, because $A \times B$ necessarily has more than 17 elements (in fact, no Cartesian-product-like $C$ can work, because the number of elements is fixed). What about some 17-element subset of $A \times B$? (In the category of sets, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are injective, but not necessarily surjective). But, what if $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ are both surjective? So, that can't work, because there's no $\gamma$ that could satisfy this (doesn't that mean that, in the general category of sets, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have to also be surjective? If they don't ""touch"" every element in both $A$ and $B$, then one can just define a $\alpha'$ or $\beta'$ that touches the elements $\alpha$ or $\beta$ don't—thus making impossible a direct product.) Let $\alpha(c_n) = a_n$ and $\beta(c_n) = b_n$. This contains bijective $\alpha$ and $\beta$, but all we have to do is define a $C'$ such that $\alpha'(c_1) = a_1$ and $\beta'(c_1) = b_2$. Ok. So, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have to be bijective. Let's try to prove this via negation: Since these mappings are necessarily bijective, they have to have an inverse. Thus, $\gamma$ must be such that $\gamma = \alpha^{-1} \circ \alpha'$ and $\gamma = \beta^{-1} \circ \beta'$. To show that we can choose an object $C'$ where $\gamma$ can't make the graph commute, just choose $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ such that $\alpha^{-1} \circ \alpha \neq \beta^{-1} \circ \beta$. Can I assume that such an $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$ will always exist? Was there no point to the number of elements being $17$ specifically?

1369118,What plays the role of the identity for the generalized convolution associated to the Fourier-Bessel transform?,"In traditional Fourier theory, the Dirac delta plays the role of an ""identity"" for the $L^1$ algebra with respect to the usual convolution. The convolution is traditionally built out of group structures by translating by group elements. The Fourier-Bessel transform of $f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^+)$ is given by $$\mathcal{F}_{\nu}f(y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^+} j_{\nu}(2\pi xy)f(x)\,d\mu_{\nu}(x),$$ where $-\frac{1}{2} < \nu$, $d\mu_{\nu}(x) = \frac{2\pi^{\nu+1}}{\Gamma(\nu+1)} x^{2\nu+1}\,dx$, and $j_{\nu}(x) = 2^{\nu} \Gamma(\nu+1)x^{-\nu}J_{\nu}(x)$. (Here $J_{\nu}$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.) The Fourier-Bessel transform has a notion of translation associated to it which is not generated by a group; instead, the translation is given by $$T_y^{\nu} f(x) = \frac{\Gamma(\nu+1)}{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma\left(\nu+\frac{1}{2}\right)} \int_{-1}^1 f\left(\sqrt{x^2-2\alpha xy + y^2}\right)(1-\alpha^2)^{\nu-\frac{1}{2}} \,d\nu.$$ With this generalized translation, a generalized convolution can be defined: $$ (f\ast_{\nu} g)(y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^+} T_y^{\nu}f(x)g(x)\,d\mu_{\nu}(x).$$ The generalized translation and convolution share many properties with the usual (Fourier) translation and convolution operators: $$ T_y^{\nu} (j_{\nu}(\lambda x)) = j_{\nu}(\lambda x) j_{\nu}(\lambda y) \tag{1} $$ $$ \mathcal{F}_{\nu}(T_y^{\nu}f)(x) = j_{\nu}(2\pi xy) \mathcal{F}_{\nu}f(x) \tag{2} $$ $$ \mathcal{F}_{\nu}(f\ast_{\nu} g) = \mathcal{F}_{\nu}f \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\nu} g \tag{3} $$ $$ f\ast_{\nu} g = g\ast_{\nu} f \tag{4}$$ The first is analogous to the property that $e^{-i\omega(t-t')} = e^{-i\omega t}e^{-i\omega t'}$. The second is analogous to the property that $\mathcal{F}(f(\cdot - t)) = e^{-i\omega t}\mathcal{F}f$. The third is analogous to the usual convolution theorem. The last is a statement of the commutativity of convolution. With the numerous analogues, it is natural to consider what plays the role of the Dirac delta for the generalized convolution for the Fourier-Bessel transform. The usual Dirac delta is not an identity for the generalized convolution. To see this, let's see what the generalized translation of the Dirac delta is. $$T_y^{\nu}\delta(x) = \frac{\Gamma(\nu+1)}{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma \left(\nu+ \frac{1}{2}\right)}\int_{-1}^1 \delta\left(\sqrt{x^2-2\alpha xy+y^2}  \right)(1-\alpha^2)^{\nu-\frac{1}{2}}\,d\alpha.$$ (This is of course meant as a distributional integral.) The Dirac delta has the following property: $$\delta(g(z)) = \sum_{z_0}\frac{\delta(z-z_0)}{g'(z_0)},$$ where the $z_0$ are the zeroes of $g$. Here $g(\alpha) = \sqrt{x^2-2\alpha xy+y^2}$. $g(\alpha) = 0$ when $\alpha = \frac{x^2+y^2}{2xy}$. Moreover, $g'(\alpha) = -\frac{xy}{g(\alpha)}$ and so $$\delta\left(\sqrt{x^2-2\alpha xy+y^2}\right) = -\frac{g\left(\frac{x^2 +y^2}{2xy}\right)}{xy}\delta\left(\alpha - \frac{x^2+y^2}{2xy}\right) = 0.$$ The generalized translation of the Dirac delta actually vanishes! This is more or less because $\frac{1}{g'} \propto g$. With standard translation operators, by definition we have $$\delta \ast f = \langle \delta_y,f\rangle = f(y),$$ Replacing this with the generalized translation, this would read $$\delta\ast_{\nu} f = \langle T_y^{\nu}\delta, f\rangle \stackrel{?}{=} f(y).$$ However the above analysis shows that $\langle T_y^{\nu}\delta, f\rangle = 0$ since $T_y^{\nu}\delta$ is zero and so the Dirac delta is not the identity with regards to the generalized convolution. Since the usual Dirac delta is not an identity with regards to convolution, my question is: what is? I've thought about this for a while but nothing jumps out at me. I would think it's some sort of variation on the Dirac delta but it's not clear at all due to the nonlinear nature (in terms of coordinates) of the generalized translation. Much of this is based on this paper by Ghobber and Jaming.","['integral-transforms', 'convolution', 'distribution-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1369171,Example of a surface where more than one coordinate patch is needed.,"I find the sphere example underwhelming. Sure I can see that one open patch will not cover it, but it still manages to cover it mostly . So much so that you can go ahead and, say, calculate the area of a sphere using only one patch $$\sigma(u,v) = (r \cos(u) \sin(v), r \sin(u) \sin(v), r \cos(v))$$
with 
$$ u \in \Omega_u = (0,\pi), \qquad v \in \Omega_v = (0, 2\pi) $$
Then 
$$\sigma_{Area} = \int_{\Omega_u}\int_{\Omega_v}\sqrt{\sigma_u^2 \sigma_v^2-\sigma_u \cdot\sigma_v} du dv = \int_{\Omega_u}\int_{\Omega_v}\sqrt{r^4 \sin(v)^2} du dv \\ \\= r^2 \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi}|\sin(v)| du dv \\ \\ = 2 \pi r^2 \int_0^{\pi} \sin(v) dv \\ \\ = 4 \pi r^2$$ The problem for me when trying to understand differential geometry is that the books all too often mention the sphere as an example of something needing an atlas (which seems, to me, to be pragmatically false) then move on to generalized theorems in $n$ dimensions and very quickly loose me. I'm sure that for doing something you may sometimes need more than one patch on the sphere but I would appreciate an example that I can easily understand, and compute things with, but that requires some extra care because I cannot use only one patch and get away with it. (The torus also allows me to cheat). In particular I'd like an example of a bounded smooth surface that is easy to understand but requires at least two coordinate patches to, say, compute the total surface area.

1369182,Regularity of a weak solution,"The problem is formulated as follows: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ a bounded Lipschitz domain. For $u\in L_2(\Omega)$ one can define the one dimensional weak dirivative $\partial_1 u$. Now define the space $M:=\{u\in L_2(\Omega):\partial_1 u\in L_2(\Omega)\}$. Then $M$ with the norm $\|u\|_{L_2}+\|\partial_1 u\|_{L_2}$ is a Hilbert space. It is also clear that $C_0^\infty(\Omega)\subset M$. Now debote by $M_0$ the closure of $C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ w.r.t. the special norm. Let's consider the following equation: Given some $f\in L_2(\Omega)$. Find $u\in M_0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega f\partial_1 vdx=\int_\Omega\partial_1u\partial_1vdx
\end{equation}
is valid for all $v\in M_0$. From Lax-Milgram and one dimensional Poincare's inequality one can deduce that such $u$ exists and is unique. Now the question is, if $f\in H_{loc}^1(\Omega)$, is $\partial_1 u$ in general also in $H_{loc}^1(\Omega)$? Update : So far I have proved that if $f\in H_0^1(\Omega)$, then $\partial_1\alpha$ has to be in $H^1_{loc}(\Omega)$. The trick is to use the discrete Fourier transform. Let me explain the trick I used (I am also not quite sure if I was mistaken, since I am not very familiar with the Fourier transform method). Since $f$ and $\alpha$ can be approximated by smooth functions with compact support, we can extend them to $\mathbb{R}^2$ by setting their value equal to zero outside of the region and they belong to $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and $M(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular, they and their derivatives can be written as the discrete Fourier sum (I will write also scalar components by $c$, since they don't essentially influence the result), for example,
\begin{align}
f(x)&=c\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}Ff(n)e^{in\cdot x},\\
\partial_2f(x)&=c\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}n_2Ff(n)e^{in\cdot x},\\
\partial_1\alpha(x)&=c\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}n_1F\alpha(n)e^{in\cdot x}
\end{align} and so on. In fact, using the standard differnce quotient method one derive
\begin{equation}
f(x)-\partial_1\alpha(x)=G(x_2)
\end{equation}
for some $G\in L_2(\Omega)$. Now for $g(x):=G(x_2)$ we also have its Fourier sum
\begin{equation}
G(x)=c\sum_{n_2\in\mathbb{Z}}Fg(n_2)e^{in_2\cdot x_2}.
\end{equation} Sum up all, we have
\begin{equation}
\partial_2f(x)=c\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}n_1n_2F\alpha(n)e^{in\cdot x}+c\sum_{n_2\in\mathbb{Z}}n_2Fg(n_2)e^{in_2x_2}.
\end{equation}
Since $\partial_2 f\in L_2$, we have
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}|n_1n_2F\alpha(n)|^2<\infty.
\end{equation}
Then define $v(x)=c\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^2}n_1n_2F\alpha(n)e^{in\cdot x}$, and $v$ is in $L_2$ and using the definition of weak derivative, it is actually equal to $\partial_2\partial_1\alpha$.","['sobolev-spaces', 'regularity-theory-of-pdes', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
1369206,Mason's Theorem Proof. From Algebra (S. Lang),"I have a question about the last step in the proof of Mason's Theorem. I will write it. Mason's Theorem. If $a, b$ and $c$ are relatively prime polynomials such that $a + b = c$ , then $$\max \{ \deg(a) , \deg(b) , \deg(c)\} \leq N_0(abc) -1,$$ where $N_0(f)$ is the number of distinct factors of $f$ . Proof: Let $\displaystyle a(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{s_a} (t-\alpha_i)^{u_i},~ b(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{s_b}(t-\beta_i)^{v_i}, ~c(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{s_c}(t-\gamma_i)^{w_i} $ $N_0(abc) = s_a + s_b + s_c$ .  Let $\displaystyle f = \frac{a}{c},~ g= \frac{b}{c}$ .
Hence $f + g = 1 \Rightarrow f' + g' = 0 \Rightarrow f' = - g'$ . $\displaystyle\frac{f'}{f} = \sum_{i=1}^{s_a} \frac{u_i}{t-\alpha_i} - \sum_{i=1}^{s_c} \frac{w_i}{t-\gamma_i}, ~~ \frac{g'}{g} =\sum_{i=1}^{s_b} \frac{v_i}{t-\beta_i} - \sum_{i=1}^{s_c} \frac{w_i}{t-\gamma_i}$ $\displaystyle \frac{b}{a} = \frac{g}{f} =-\frac{f'/f}{g'/g}=-\frac{M f'/f}{M g'/g},\tag{1} $ where $M =\prod_{i=1}^{s_a}(t-\alpha_i) \prod_{i=1}^{s_b}(t-\beta_i)\prod_{i=1}^{s_c}(t-\gamma_i)$ . So the denominator and nominator in $(1)$ has the degree at most $s_a + s_b + s_c -1 $ . Then we conclude the inequality of the theorem.

1369328,sample variance of regular polygon upon superimposition of vertices,"Given, the vertices of a regular polygon, the centroid here would be the sample mean of the vertices and we assume it to be at the origin.
The distance from each vertex to centroid is $\frac{s}{2\sin(\frac{180}{n})}$ where $n$ is number of sides and $s$ is the length of side. My definition of variance of vertices (loose notation, as I havent defined any probability law  or sampling law) is sum of squares of distance from each vertex to the center divided by the total number of vertices. Question: What would be the 'above defined' variance if one vertex was made to be superimposed on another adjacent vertex, i.e an edge was dropped? (Edge is dropped from a visual perspective only, and note that the number of vertices is still the same in the denominator for computing the variance.) Similarly, what would be the variance if two edges were dropped by superimposing two vertices on two corresponding adjacent vertices? and so on, what would be the variances after this process is done with three vertices? Can this sample variance be parametrized either as a formula or as an approximation, given as input the number of edges that are dropped (as in via superimposition), the number of sides originally before the dropping process, and the length of each side? Do note again, that the total number of points is not reduced and remains the same, and the edge is only visually seeming like dropped although in reality the edge exists with zero distance. On dimension, let's stick to 2D coordinates being used for describing each vertex of the regular polygon. Just in case you need some more structure or standardization of notation, you may assume that all the regular polygons that we start with prior to the point-superposition/edge dropping process are inscribed in a unit-circle. Also, I ask this question because I'd like to do this: Let V be the variance of the initial regular polygon. Then say the edge dropping was done to get a polygon with a given configuration of say k out of the total t points superimposing at P_1. Then I compute the variance of the new set of points, which will be lesser than V. Then I'd like to scale by \alpha the  rest of the vertices t-k so that the variance of all the points equals V. Then I'd like to compare the sum of squares of distances of all pairs of points in initial polygon vs the same in the configuration after the k, t-k configuration was reached and see how much they differ by.","['combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry', 'statistics', 'combinatorics', 'computational-geometry']"
