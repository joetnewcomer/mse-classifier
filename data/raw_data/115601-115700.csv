1695451,How to prove that for a nonempty convex subset $S \subset X$ ($X$ is normed vector space) it is true that $\partial \overline{S} = \partial S$?,"I am having trouble with the concept of convexity. 
This is the statement I'm trying to prove. Let $X$ be normed vector space. If $S \subset X$ is convex and $S^\circ \neq  \emptyset$ then $\partial \overline{S} = \partial S$. Here, $S^\circ$ denotes the interior of $S$, 
$\overline{S}$ is the closure of $S$, and 
$\partial S$ is the boundary of $S$. The definition of convexity I'm given in my textbook is 
as follows:
The set $S \subset X$, where X is vector space, is convex if
for all $x,y \in S$ and for all $t \in (0,1)$ it is true that
 $tx + (1-t)y \in S$. My approach was to prove both $\partial \overline{S}
\subset \partial S$ and $\partial \overline{S} \supset 
\partial S$. I had no trouble with the first, as I didn't need to use 
convexity at all. However, I cannot figure out how to prove the other.
I've tried it like this: Let $x$ be in $\partial S$. In order to prove that
$x \in \partial \overline{S}$, we must show (by definition
of boundary given in my textbook) that 
for all $\varepsilon>0$ the open ball $B(x,\varepsilon)$
intersects with both set $\overline{S}$ and its complement $X\setminus
\overline{S}$. Yet again I hit a dead end trying to prove the second one, 
because I do not understand how convexity plays into it.
(I have some sort of intuitive understanding of why
the initial statement holds true, but I can't quite figure out
how prove it.) Perhaps some other approach is best instead.
I would appreciate any help!","['normed-spaces', 'general-topology', 'convex-analysis']"

1696017,Convergence of $r^n/n$ when $|r| > 1$.,"Consider $r\in \mathbb{R}$ and the real number sequence $(a_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ where $$a_n = \dfrac{r^n}{n}.$$ If $|r|<1$, we know that $r_n\to 0$ when $n\to \infty$. Since $1/n \to 0$ when $n\to \infty$ by theorem about sequences we know that since $$a_n = \left(\dfrac{1}{n}\right)(r^n),$$ we have $a_n\to 0$ when $n\to \infty$. If, on the other hand $|r|=1$, then we have $$\left|a_n\right|=\left|\dfrac{r^n}{n}\right|=\dfrac{1}{n},$$ and thus it easily follows that $a_n\to 0$ when $n\to \infty$ because of the archimedean property of the real numbers. Finally we have the case $|r| >1$. In this case I'm having a hard time. Intuition tells me that the sequence will diverge, but I'm unsure on how to prove this. What I know is that if $|r|>1$ then the sequence $r^n$ is unbounded, but I couldn't get anything from this. I tried then considering first the case $r >1$ where we know that we can write $r = 1 + h$ so that $r^n \geq 1 + nh$ with $h > 0$, but this got me nowhere.

1696140,Computing the limits of integration when doing a nontrivial coordinate transform,"In Aigner, Ziegler: Proofs_from_THE_BOOK they explain an elegant derivation of $\zeta(2)$ given by Beukers, Calabi and Kolk. One starts from the integral
$$
J = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1-x^2y^2}dxdy = \frac{3}{4}\zeta(2)
$$
To compute the integral they use the following non-trivial coordinate transform
$$
x = \frac{\sin u}{\cos v}, y = \frac{\sin v}{\cos u}
$$
The reason for this transform is that the Jacobi determinate of this transformation turns out to be
$$
|D| = 1-\frac{\sin^2u\sin^2v}{\cos^2u\cos^2v} = 1 - x^2y^2
$$
So after the transformation the integral becomes magically
$$
\int_{f_1(u,v)}^{f_2(u,v)} \int_{g_1(u,v)}^{g_2(u,v)} 1 dudv
$$
Now they argue that the limits of the integration are
$$
f_1(u,v) = g_1(u,v) = 0 \\
f_2(u,v) = \frac{\pi}{2}\\
g_2(u,v) = \frac{\pi}{2}-v
$$
so that the integral turns out to be
$$
J = \frac{\pi^2}{8}

I have been looking at a proof as to why the Lebesgue measure ""fails"" when we consider it as a mapping from $2^{\mathbb{R}}$, and it seems to be more algebraic in nature even though it is an Analysis book. Condensed, it basically defines a relation $x\sim y$ if $x - y \in \mathbb{Q}$ for $x,y \in [0,1]$. We then consider the set of equivalence classes (basically quotient $[0,1]$ by this equivalence relation), and the rest of the proof is over my head, in the sense that I have no idea where the rest of the steps are coming from. In the end, we get a contradiction, so our measure doesn't work, basically. My question is about any kind of intuition behind why we need to restrict our domain?

Determine the convergence or divergence of the sequence $(x_n)$ where $$x_n=\frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n}.$$ My first approach was : Well, since $(x_n)$ is the sum of the sequences $\left(\frac{1}{n+1}\right),\ldots,\left(\frac{1}{2n}\right)$ and each of them are convergent, in fact they converges to $0$, then the limit of $(x_n)$ must be $0$. My second approach was : If we make the calculations, we have that $$x_{n+1}-x_n=\frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n+2)}>0$$ then $$x_{n+1}>x_n$$ i.e., $x_n$ is an increasing sequence. Also, as in $x_n$ we sum $n$ elements which are less or equan than $\frac{1}{n+1}$,  then $$x_n=\frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2n}<\frac{n}{n+1}<1$$ i.e., $(x_n)$ is a bounded sequence. Now, since $(x_n)$ is increasing and bounded sequence, it follows that its limit is the supremum of $(x_n)$. Annoying question. But how $(x_n)$ can converge to $0$ (as shown in my first approach) and at the same time converges to its supremum when it is an increasing sequence? Can be 0 its supremum? It is not a contradiction? Any help would be appreciated.","['harmonic-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
1696267,Intuition about the first isomorphism theorem,"I'm currently studying group theory and recently I've read about the first isomorphism theorem which can be stated as follows: Let $G$ and $H$ be groups and $\varphi :G\to H$ a homomorphism, then $\ker \varphi$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, $\varphi(G)$ is a subgroup of $H$ and  $G/\ker \varphi \simeq \varphi(G)$. The proof is quite easy, but I've been thinking about what's the best way to understand this result. In that setting I've came up with the following intuition: It's easy to see that a homomorphism $\varphi : G\to H$ is injective if and only if $\ker \varphi = \{e\}$ where $e$ is the identity of $G$. Now, my intuition about the first isomorphism theorem is: if $\varphi : G\to H$ is a homomorphism which is not injective, we can then construct a new group on which the equivalent homomorphism is indeed injective. We do this by quotienting out what is in the way of making $\varphi$ injective, that is, everything that is in the kernel. In that way taking the quotient $G/\ker \varphi$ we construct a group on which we ""kill"" everything that is in the kernel of $\varphi$. The natual projection of $\varphi$ to this quotient will then be an injective function. So is this the best way to understand the first isomorphism theorem? It's a way to ""get out of the way"" everything which is stoping a homomorphism from being an injective map? If not, what is the correct intuition about this theorem and its importance?","['intuition', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-homomorphism']"
1696284,Is there any uncountably infinite set that does not generate the reals?,"Does there exist an uncountably infinite set $X \subseteq \mathbb R$ such that $\mathbb R \neq \left<X\right>$? I can't think of any, but I'm also having trouble trying to prove that no such subset exists. For example: $\mathbb R$ is uncountable and obviously $\mathbb R = \left<\mathbb R\right>$. The Cantor set $C$ is uncountable, and we know that $C - C = [0, 1]$, so then since $\mathbb R = \left<[0, 1]\right>$ we know that $C$ also generates $\mathbb R$. Also the set of irrationals $\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q$ is uncountable, but we can generate all the rational numbers by fixing one irrational number $\alpha$ and then saying the any rational number $x$ shall be $(\alpha + x) - \alpha$, since both $\alpha + x$ and $\alpha$ are irrational. So the examples that quickly come to mind all generate the reals. Is there a simple counterexample?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

1696341,Perfect Square Arising from Prime Pythagorean Triple,"This problem appears as the second question in the British Mathematical Olympiad 2014--2015 Round 1 paper ( https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo1-2015.pdf ). Positive integers $p$, $a$ and $b$ satisfy the equation $p^2 + a^2 = b^2$. Prove that if $p$ is a prime greater than $3$, then $a$ is a multiple of $12$ and $2(p + a + 1)$ is a perfect square. Using the difference of two squares, unique prime factorisation theorem and properties of the product of subsequent integers, I have managed to prove that $a$ is a multiple of 12 (i.e. that $a = 12q$ for $q \in \mathbb{N}$). However, for the second part, I am not sure how to link the Pythagorean theorem to the required result, given that $a$ is a multiple of $12$. Since $2(p + a + 1)$ is even, then it is easy to deduce that we are looking for an expression for $t$ satisfying $p + a + 1 = 2t^2$.

For $m=0$ it is trivial, there is only one way to do it. For $m=1$, there are $n-2$ ways to choose a number with 2 adjacent numbers to pick for its partner, and 2 ways to choose a number with only 1 adjacent number, for $2(n-2)+2 = 2(n-1)$ ways, except that this method will count duplicates. So to avoid that, instead when you choose the first number, always construct the pair by taking the number that follows it. There are only $n-1$ ways of doing this, since $n$ does not have a follower. For $m=2$ we do not require that the second pair be consecutive with the first, only that the 2 numbers within a pair be consecutive. I have tried to work out this case, but it is complicated both by the fact that choosing $\{2,3\}$ as the first pair, means it is impossible to select $1$ second because it no longer has a pair (and similarly for $n-2$), and also that I do not know how to count without introducing duplicates.

The list of numbers may be of any length $\ge 2$. I first saw that if they were multiples of 4 numbers then it must be divisible by 4 but it isn't so they are multiples of 2 or 3 numbers.
Also all the two or three numbers must be 2-digit or 3-digit.
I tried pairing consecutive numbers but no two consecutive numbers produced a result whose units digit was 4. So I tried for 3 number pairs. The only two pairs were $(*2, *3, *4)$ and $(*7, *8, *9)$. (Replace the stars with one-digit numbers). So now since $70\cdot 70\cdot 70=343000 \text{ and } 80\cdot 80\cdot 80 = 512000$.

1697037,Understanding the notion of a connection and covariant derivative,"I have been reading Nakahara's book ""Geometry, Topology & Physics"" with the aim of teaching myself some differential geometry. Unfortunately I've gotten a little stuck on the notion of a connection and how it relates to the covariant derivative . As I understand it a connection $\nabla :\mathcal{X}(M)\times\mathcal{X}(M)\rightarrow\mathcal{X}(M)$, where $\mathcal{X}(M)$ is the set of tangent vector fields over a manifold $M$, is defined such that given two vector fields $X,V\in\mathcal{X}(M)$ then $\nabla :(X,V)\mapsto\nabla_{X}V$. The connection enables one to ""connect"" neighbouring tangent spaces such that one can meaningfully compare vectors in the two tangent spaces. What confuses me is that Nakahara states that this is in some sense the correct generalisation of a directional derivative and that we identify the quantity $\nabla_{X}V$ with the covariant derivative, but what makes this a derivative of a vector field? In what sense is the connection enabling one to compare the vector field at two different points on the manifold (surely required in order to define its derivative), when the mapping is from the (Cartesian product of) the set of tangent vector fields to itself? I thought that the connection $\nabla$ ""connected"" two neighbouring tangent spaces through the notion of parallel transport in which on transports a vector field along a chosen curve, $\gamma :(a,b)\rightarrow M$, in the manifold connecting the two tangent spaces. Given this, what does the quantity $\nabla_{e_{\mu}}e_{\nu}\equiv\nabla_{\mu}e_{\nu}=\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda}e_{\lambda}$ represent? ($e_{\mu}$ and $e_{\nu}$ are coordinate basis vectors in a given tangent space $T_{p}M$ at a point $p\in M$) I get that since $e_{\mu},e_{\nu}\in T_{p}M$, then $\nabla_{\mu}e_{\nu}\in T_{p}M$ and so can be expanded in terms of the coordinate basis of $T_{p}M$, but I don't really understand what it represents?!

1697050,The definition of Determinant in the spirit of algebra and geometry,"The concept of determinant is quite unmotivational topic to introduce. Textbooks use such ""strung out"" introductions like axiomatic definition, Laplace expansion, Leibniz'a permutation formula or something like signed volume. Question : is the following a possible way to introduce the determinant? Determinant is all about determing whether a given set of vectors are linearly independent, and a direct way to check this is to add scalar multiplications of column vectors to get the diagonal form: $$\begin{pmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}  & a_{23} & a_{24} \\
a_{31} & a_{32}  & a_{33} & a_{34} \\
a_{41} & a_{42}  & a_{43} & a_{44} \\
\end{pmatrix} \thicksim \begin{pmatrix} 
d_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & d_2  & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0  & d_3 & 0 \\
0 & 0  & 0 & d_4 \\
\end{pmatrix}.$$ During the diagonalization process we demand that the information, i.e. the determinant, remains unchanged. Now it's clear that the vectors are linearly independent if every $d_i$ is nonzero, i.e. $\prod_{i=1}^n d_i\neq0$ . It may also be the case that two columns are equal and there is no diagonal form, so we must add a condition that annihilates the determinant (this is consistent with $\prod_{i=1}^n d_i=0$ ), since column vectors can't be linearly independent. If we want to have a real valued function that provides this information, then we simply introduce an ad hoc function $\det:\mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with following properties: $$\det (a_1,\ldots,a_i,\ldots,a_j,\ldots,a_n)=\det (a_1,\ldots,a_i,\ldots,k\cdot a_i+a_j,\ldots,a_n).$$ $$\det(d_1\cdot e_1,\ldots,d_n\cdot e_n)=\prod_{i=1}^n d_i.$$ $$\det (a_1,\ldots,a_i,\ldots,a_j,\ldots,a_n)=0, \space \space \text{if} \space \space a_i=a_j.$$ From the previous definition of determinant we can infer the multilinearity property: $$[a_1,\ldots,c_1 \cdot u+c_2 \cdot v,\ldots,a_n]\thicksim diag[d_1,\ldots,c_1 \cdot d'_i+c_2 \cdot d''_i ,\ldots,d_n],$$ so $$\det[a_1,\ldots,c_1 \cdot u+c_2 \cdot v,\ldots,a_n]=\prod_{j=1:j\neq i}^n d_j(c_1 \cdot d'_i+c_2 \cdot d''_i)$$ $$=c_1\det(diag[d_1,\ldots, d'_i,\ldots,d_n])+c_2\det(diag[d_1,\ldots, d''_i,\ldots,d_n])$$ $$=c_1\det[a_1,\ldots,u,\ldots,a_n]+c_2\det[a_1,\ldots, v,\ldots,a_n].$$ Note that previous multilinearity together with property $(1)$ gives the property $(2)$ , so we know from the literature that the determinant function $\det:\mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ actually exists and it is unique. Obviously, the determinant offers information how orthogonal a set of vectors is. Thus, with Gram-Schmidt process we can form an orthogonal set of vectors form set $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ , and by multilinearity and property $(2)$ the absolute value of determinant is the volume of parallelepiped spanned by the set of vectors. Definition .
Volume of parallelepiped formed by set of vectors $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is $Vol(a_1,\ldots, a_n)=Vol(a_1,\ldots, a_{n-1})\cdot |a_{n}^{\bot}|=|a_{1}^{\bot}|\cdots |a_{n}^{\bot}|$ , where $a_{i}^{\bot} \bot span(a_1,\ldots, a_{i-1}).$ This approach to determinant works equally well if we begin with the volume of a parallelepiped (geometric approach) or with the search of invertibility (algebraic approach). I was motivated by the book Linear algebra and its applications by Lax on chapter 5: Rather than start with a formula for the determinant, we shall deduce it from the properties forced on it by the geometric properties of signed volume. This approach to determinants is due to E. Artin. $\det (a_1,\ldots,a_n)=0$ , if $a_i=a_j$ , $i\neq j.$ $\det (a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ is a multilinear function of its arguments, in the sense that if all $a_i, i \neq j$ are fixed, $\det$ is a linear function of the remaining argument $a_j.$ $\det(e_1,\ldots,e_n)=1.$","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'determinant']"

The number $k$ is considered a Sierpinski number if the sequence determined by that $k$ contains no primes.

After immpleneting it into my integral, I get to this point $$\int\frac{(t^2+2t-1)(t^2+2t-1)}{(t^2+1)2(t+1)^2}\,dt$$ I don't have any idea what I should do next (thought to do another substitution but don't know what to substitute).","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration']"
1697313,Find the Volume lying inside both the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$ and the cylinder $x^2+y^2=ax$,"Taking the equation for the cylinder I completed the square to find $(x-\frac{a}{2})^2+y^2=\frac{a^2}{4}$ and the sphere clearly has radius $a$ and is centered at the origin. Now to solve this question we express the radius in terms of theta using the equation for the cylinder (giving $r=a\cos\theta$) and then we solve for $z$ in the sphere's equation giving $z=\sqrt{a^2-x^2-y^2}=\sqrt{a^2-r^2}$ and setup the integral as follows (multiplying by 4 since we only consider the first octant but the total area is in 4 octants): $$
4\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\int_0^{a\cos\theta}\sqrt{a^2-r^2}rdrd\theta
$$ This is the part I don't understand, why exactly do we express the radius in terms of the cylinder and then why do we solve for $z$ in terms of the sphere and integrate that? Clearly it gives the volume contained but I can't fathom how.","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates', 'calculus']"

1697351,A problem to show a certain sum is invariant in some Euclidean geometric configurations.,"$\textbf{Problem.}$ Suppose circles of radius $r$ and radius $s$ are externally tangent at the point $1/2$ and internally tangent to the unit circle. There are infinitely many such configurations, one of which is illustrated in the diagram below. Prove that $\displaystyle\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{s}=\frac{16}{3}$ for every such configuration. The above problem appeared in a complex analysis exam in some graduate school. I tried number of things, but nothing worked yet and I have little clue about what I should do to solve this problem. One of the thing I tried is just setting the given configuration into the following equations by setting the centers of the circles as $p,q$ to obtain $|p-\frac{1}{2}|=r,|q-\frac{1}{2}|=s,|p|+r=|q|+s=1,r+s=|p-q|$ and to try some random computations but it didn't work. I also tried to use some Mobius transform but it didn't work. Please let me know how to solve this or if this problem is related to some known stuff.","['complex-analysis', 'euclidean-geometry']"

The only nontrivial example I have thus far found of a counterexample given by a finite topological space is given in the article 'A counterexample in finite fixed point theory' by John R. Isbell (under the pseudonym 'H. C. Enos'). Isbell exhibited a finite topological space which is a counterexample to the following question: Question (Lee Mohler, 1970): Given a topological space $X$ which is the union of closed subspaces $Y$ and $Z$ such that $Y$, $Z$, and $Y \cap Z$ have the fixed point property, does it follow that $X$ has the fixed point property? It thus seems natural to ask: what are some other examples of interesting nontrivial counterexamples given by finite topological spaces?","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples']"

However I am stuck at a step: The idea is to use the theorem: Suppose $f:N^n \to M^m$ is a smooth map between smooth manifolds $N,M$ of dimension $n,m$ respectively. Then preimage of any regular value $y$ of $f$ is a regular submanifold of $M$ and is of dimension $n-m$ . Here, $y$ is a regular value means that the rank of $f$ at every point in the preimage of $y$ has rank exactly $m$ .
