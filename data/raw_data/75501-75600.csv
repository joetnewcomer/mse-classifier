941415,Bochner: Lebesgue Obsolete?,"Bochner's notion of integral:
$$F\text{ Bochner integrable}:\iff \exists S_n\in\mathcal{S}:\quad \int\|S_m-S_n\|\mathrm{d}\mu\to 0\quad(S_n\to F)$$
This version totally circumvents Lebesgue's notion of integral. But Bochner and Lebesgue agree on complex measurable functions. So the question arises: Is Lebesgue obsolete?

941451,How prove this $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\frac{1}{2}(b-a)[f(a)+f(b)]-\frac{1}{12}(b-a)^3f''(\xi)$,"Let $f(x)$  be a twice-differentiable function on $(a,b)$,show that there exsit $\xi\in(a,b)$ ,such
$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\dfrac{1}{2}(b-a)[f(a)+f(b)]-\dfrac{1}{12}(b-a)^3f''(\xi)$$ if this problem condition is Amuss that $f(x)$ is a three-differentiable function, $$f(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(\xi_{1})\cdot (x-a)^2}{2}$$
$$f(x)=f(b)+f'(b)(x-b)+\frac{f''(\xi_{2})\cdot (x-b)^2}{2}$$
so
$(1)+(2)$
$$\Longrightarrow 2f(x)=f(a)+f(b)+f'(a)(x-a)+f'(b)(x-b)+\dfrac{1}{2}[f''(\xi_{1})+f''(\xi_{2})][(x-a)^2+(x-b)^2]$$
since $f(x)$ is a three-differentiable function,so $f''(x)$ is 
continuous,so there exsit $\xi\in(\xi_{1},\xi_{2})$,such 
$$\dfrac{1}{2}[f''(\xi_{1})+f''(\xi_{2})]=f''(\xi)$$
$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\dfrac{1}{2}(b-a)[f(a)+f(b)]-\dfrac{1}{12}(b-a)^3f''(\xi)$$

941518,"Why are ""not bounded"" operators not everywhere defined?","Let $X, Y$ be Banach spaces, $\mathcal{D}(T)$ a subspace of $X$, and $T\colon X\to  Y$ a linear map. Such a $T$ is commonly called an unbounded linear operator , where unbounded just means that the domain $\mathcal{D}(T)$ is possibly a strict subspace of $X$. I am confused by all the general questions flying around this definition and ask for some clarification. Is there a general argument why we consider such operators which are not defined on the whole space? In other words, I am interested in the following statement: Statement. $\mathcal{D}(T)=X$ $\Rightarrow$ $T$ is bounded, or equivalently, $T$ is not bounded $\Rightarrow$ $\mathcal{D}(T)\neq X$. In this context it might be interesting to look at the closed graph theorem: And operator defined on all of $X$ is bounded if and only if it is closed. Therefore it makes sense to ask whether there exist operators defined on all of $X$ which are not bounded. There are many specific cases when this definition comes in handy. For example, differential operators are often first defined on a small class of functions (e.g. compactly supported, smooth functions) and can then be extended to larger domains. But here I am really considering any spaces and operators. Of course, it would be interesting to know whether and how this changes when we restrict $X, Y$ to be Hilbert spaces.","['operator-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

941582,Tangent space to $\mathbb{R}P^{n}$,"I could not find any other question here related to this. If I have missed out, then this could be voted as a duplicate(Sorry if it is!). I was just trying to figure out the tangent space to the projective space and intuitively I thought that as the space is itself obtained by identifying antipodal points on the sphere, one could look at the tangent space to this quotient space as quotient of the tangent spaces to the sphere at the antipodal points. In other words, if $p \in \mathbb{R}P^n$ is obtained by identifying $x,-x \in \mathbb{S}^n$, then does $T_p(\mathbb{R}P^n)$ stem out of identifying the spaces $T_x(\mathbb{S}^n)$ and $T_{-x}(\mathbb{S}^n)$?? Is this ""quotient of tangent spaces"" being the same as the tangent space of the quotient space true in general?? On a related note, I came across a problem instructing one to show that if $$\pi : \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{R}P^n$$ is the quotient map with $\pi(x) = p$, then there is an isomorphism $$\pi_*|_x :T_x(\mathbb{S}^n) \to T_p(\mathbb{R}P^n)$$. How does one show this?? I can show that $\pi$ is smooth, but not sure whether it is a diffeomorphism, whence the above result would follow ?? I hope I have not missed out on something obvious here.

941814,Rigorous Covering Space Construction,"Construct a simply connected covering space of the space $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ that is the union of a sphere and diameter. Okay, let's pretend for a moment that I've shown, using van Kampen's theorem or some other such method, that X has the fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}$, and I have in mind a covering space that consists of a row of spheres each connected to the next by a line segment, along with a map from that row of spheres to X that takes the line segments to the diameter, and the spheres to the sphere. It's not hard to sow that this choice is simply connected. My question is not how to do all of that. My question is, at this point, how do I show for certain that it is a covering space for X? The only definition I can find for a covering space, hence the only way to be certain that I have one in hand, is this: A covering space of X is a space X' with a map $p: X' \rightarrow X$ so that there exists an open cover $U_\alpha$ of X so that for each $\alpha$, $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in X', each of which is mapped by p homemorphically onto $U_\alpha$. First problem: What is the best/easiest way, handed some space X in general and with a covering space X', p in mind, to find an open cover that might fit this bill? I'm sure it isn't that hard for this particular case, but it's easy to imagine (and I think  I even have on another problem in the same set) a more difficult case. Second problem: A generic open cover might consist of uncountably infinitely many sets. How can I be certain that every single one of the $U_\alpha$'s has a preimage that's a disjoint union of sets, each of which is homeomorphic by p to $U_\alpha$? I've had some trouble with correctly showing two spaces to be homeomorphic by a map in the past, and I don't want to make a mistake of that kind again. I may be worrying over nothing here, but whenever geometric intuition comes into algebraic topology I'm never completely sure just how much explanation is considered enough for that intuition, or how to translate it into a more rigorous proof of the idea. So far I've made the mistake of not explaining enough, and I'd prefer to err on the other side from now on.

One well known fact about matrix norms is the following: If $\lambda_1\geq \dots\geq \lambda_n$ are eigenvalues of a square matrix $A$, then: $$\frac{1}{||A^{-1}||} \leq |\lambda|\leq ||A||$$ If we take our matrix norm to be the matrix 2-norm, and recall that the matrix 2 norm gives us the largest singular value, i.e. $||A||_2=\sigma_1$, then the upper bound implies: $$|\lambda_1|\leq \sigma_1$$ My question is: are there necessary and sufficient conditions for when equality above holds? I vaguely remember something like: $|\lambda_1|=\sigma_1$ iff $\lambda_1$ is non-defective, i.e. its algebraic multiplicity equals its geometric multiplicity. However, I have not been able to find a reference or prove this. Can someone point me to a reference or provide a proof. Thank you in advance for your time.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'spectral-theory']"

942189,Rings with $a^5=a$ are commutative,"Update. I have generalized the method here and have shown the theorem for many more exponents: Equational proofs of Jacobson's Theorem Let $R$ be a ring such that $a^5=a$ for all $a \in R$ . Then it follows that $R$ is commutative. This is part of a more general well-known theorem by Jacobson for arbitrary exponents ( $a^n=a$ ), which appeared on math.stackexchange a couple of times . But what I would like to see is a proof which is (1) direct / elementary and  (2) in equational language (in particular, first-order). (As far as I know, no published proof of Jacobson's Theorem is equational, but such a proof has to exist ). See here and there for such proofs for the exponents $3$ and $4$ . I hope that these proofs make the ""rules"" clear. What I've done so far: Reduced to the case that $R$ has characteristic $5$ . Any element of the form $a^4$ is central, because it is idempotent and $R$ is reduced. Also, it suffices to prove $(ab)^2= b^2 a^2$ for $a,b \in R$ . In fact, this implies $$ab=(ab)^5=a(ba)^4 b = (ba)^4 ab  = b a b (ab)^2 a^2 b$$ $$ = b a b (b^2 a^2) a^2 b  = b a b^3 a^4 b  = b a a^4 b^3 b  = b a b^4  = b b^4 a = ba.$$ Perhaps someone can feed automatic theorem provers with this problem. But my experience is that their proofs are not so easy to follow, quite long and not intuitive. So I am actually looking for hand-made proofs which eventually might also work for rings satisfying $a^p=a$ where $p$ is any prime. Edit. Here is some progress, inspired by the proof by Nagahara and Tominaga. Consider $a \in R$ and decompose the finite commutative reduced ring $\langle a \rangle$ into a product of fields - this is just the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Hence, $a=a_1+\dotsc+a_n$ where each $\langle a_i \rangle$ is a field with unit $e_i=a_i^4$ . The only fields satisfying the equation are $\mathbb{F}_2$ , $\mathbb{F}_3$ and $\mathbb{F}_5$ , which are prime fields . Hence, $a_i = z_i e_i$ for some $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ is central and therefore $a$ is central. (This incredibly quick proof for the $(a^n=a)$ -problem works for all exponents $n$ where every prime power $q$ such that $q-1|n-1$ is actually a prime number.) 2nd Edit . This leads to an equational proof. For simplicity, let us assume that $R$ has characteristic $5$ .  (This reduction is not in equational language, but the cases of characteristic $2$ and $3$ can be dealt separately and in the end everything may be put into a single equational proof.) Then $\langle a \rangle$ is a quotient of $\mathbb{F}_5[T]/(T^4-1)$ , which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_5 \times \mathbb{F}_5 \times \mathbb{F}_5 \times \mathbb{F}_5$ via $f \mapsto (f(1),f(2),f(3),f(4))$ . We can compute the corresponding idempotents: $$e_1 = (t-2)^2 (t-3)(t-4), e_2 = (t-1) (t-3) (t-4)^2, \\e_3 = (t-1)^2 (t-2) (t-4), e_4 = (t-1) (t-2) (t-3)^2.$$ Back in $R$ we obtain the equation $$a = e_1(a) + 2 e_2(a) + 3 e_3(a) + 4 e_4(a).$$ Each $e_i(a)$ is idempotent, hence central, and therefore $a$ is central. This proof may be carried out in equational language - but then we would have to verify the equation and that the $e_i(a)$ are idempotent, which is obviously very tedious. Is there also a proof which is (3) not tedious?","['noncommutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'automated-theorem-proving', 'abstract-algebra']"

Given an enumeration of $\Bbb Q$, we say that it is summable at $q$, or that $q$ is a summable point for the enumeration, if $\{n\mid q_n<q\}$ is summable. And the enumeration is summable if it is summable at each rational point. It is not hard to see that if $A$ is an infinite summable set, then we can pick any $q\in\Bbb Q$ and we can find an enumeration of $\Bbb Q$ such that $A=\{n\mid q_n<q\}$ (simply take a bijection between $A$ and $\{p\in\Bbb Q\mid p<q\}$ and a bijection of $\Bbb N\setminus A$ with $\{p\in\Bbb Q\mid q\leq p\}$ as the enumeration).

942827,Parallel transport along a cardioid,"I want to calculate an explicit example of a vector parallel transported along a cardioid to see what happens. Maybe someone could help me with that since no author of any book or pdf on the topic is capable of showing a single numerical example. So we need a vector field on a manifold (which is the cardioid itself) $X=\frac{dx^{i}}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$ and a curve $x^{i}=x^{i}(t)$. My problem is, I'm not sure how to make up a curve + vector field on a manifold. Let's take the parametrization of the cardioid in Cartesian coordinates as $x(t)=a(1+2\cos t + \cos 2t)$ $y(t)=a(2\sin t + \sin 2t)$ (I think this could be written in polar coordinates which would make more sense, but I'm not sure what happens there) So I think this should be the curve on which the vector is transported. Now I'm not sure how to make up the vector field. For the vector field I also need a function $f$, but what function? A vector function? For example could I just take $f=r(\phi, \rho)= (\rho \cos \phi, \rho \sin \phi)$ (polar coordinates) and then $X=\frac{dx^{i}}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}= \frac{dx(t)}{dt}\frac{\partial r(\phi, \rho)}{\partial \phi}+\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\frac{\partial r(\phi,\rho)}{\partial \rho}$ ? I think this looks right since the $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}$ span the tangent space. Now how exactly does the condition for parallel transport in coordinates for this looks like? 
The general formula is $\frac{\partial X^{\mu}}{dt}+ \Gamma^{\mu}_{v\lambda} \frac{\partial x^{v}(c(t))}{dt}X^{\lambda}=0$ (I know how to calculate the Levi-Civita connection with the metric,but I'm not sure about the rest)","['multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

[ Here, define $\bar S$ as the closure of $S$ in $X$, where the closure is the set containing all the adherent points of $S$ in $X$. We also define $x \in S$ an adherent point of $S$ if $B(x,r) \cap S \neq \emptyset$ for all $r>0$.] The question is reduced to proving the following: $\bar S$ is indeed closed in X. $\bar S$ contains $S$, i.e. $S \subset \bar S$. $\bar S$ is indeed the smallest in the sense that if $J \subset X$ satisfies 1. and 2., then $\bar S \subset J$. The first two is rather straightforward and I cannot formulate the proof of the third claim. Here, I would also like to write down my proof for 1. and 2. Feel free to comment on it or provide your proof so that I can learn from you. Proof of 1.: Consider $X \setminus \bar S$. For any $x \in X \setminus \bar S$, $x \notin \bar S$. It implies that there exists $r_x >0$ such that $B(x,r_x) \cap S = \emptyset$. Now, for any $y \in B(x,r_x)$, choose $r=min \{ d(x,y), r-d(x,y)\}$. Then $B(y,r) \subset B(x,r_x)$. It follows that $B(y,r) \cap S = \emptyset$, proving that $X \setminus \bar S$ is open. Proof of 2.: It is trivial since for any $x \in S$, $x \in B(x,r) \cap S$ for all $r >0$.

I also tried applying the ratio test: $\dfrac{|a_k+1|}{|a_k|}=\dfrac{|\sin(\sin\cdots(\sin(m))|}{|\sin(\sin(\cdots(m)|} =\dfrac{|\sin(a_k)|}{|a_k|}\rightarrow1$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$, but since the limit is $1$ the test is inconclusive. I don't know an awful lot about series, but I do know about the the root test, the integral test and about doing comparisons. I can't see how I can apply any of those methods here. I would be really grateful for any help with this problem!","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'trigonometric-series']"
943383,Determine Circle of Intersection of Plane and Sphere,"How can the equation of a circle be determined from the equations of a sphere and a plane which intersect to form the circle?  At a minimum, how can the radius and center of the circle be determined? For example, given the plane equation $$x=\sqrt{3}*z$$ and the sphere given by $$x^2+y^2+z^2=4$$ What is the equation of the circle that results from their intersection?  I have used Grapher to visualize the sphere and plane, and know that the two shapes do intersect: However, substituting $$x=\sqrt{3}*z$$ into $$x^2+y^2+z^2=4$$ yields the elliptical cylinder $$4x^2+y^2=4$$while substituting $$z=x/\sqrt{3}$$ into $$x^2+y^2+z^2=4$$ yields $$4x^2/3+y^2=4$$ Once again the equation of an elliptical cylinder, but in an orthogonal plane. Why does this substitution not successfully determine the equation of the circle of intersection, and how is it possible to solve for the equation, center, and radius of that circle?","['geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'spheres', 'solid-geometry', 'circles']"
943386,Is there a more general concept than position and space?,"Sorry if this is a really basic question but I've searched and googled everywhere and haven't found any relevant answers so I have to ask my question here. Please excuse me for any misuse or ignorance of basic concepts and terminology. In my understanding, in general, the position of an object should be absolute. What if you have relative positions of objects that disagree with each other? For example, imagine a 1 dimensional world (a line) composed of 3 objects, X, Y and Z: For X, Y is 5 units to its right, and Z is 10 units to its right. For Y, X does not exist, and Z is 10 units to its right. For Z, X is 5 units to its right, and Y does not exist. Now obviously these 3 statements are inconsistent with each other, you cannot draw a map of the 3 objects X, Y and Z. But you CAN draw 3 maps, one for each object. These 3 maps do not agree with each other, but the whole idea is that this concept of relative space encompasses ""absolute"" space, where the 3 statements agree with each other and are consistent. So, to me, the concept of relative space, which INCLUDES sets of inconsistent statements such as the ones I made above, is MORE GENERAL than the concept of absolute space where these sets of statements must be in agreement with each other i.e describe the same map. Now what I'm asking here is, is there an EVEN MORE GENERAL concept than the idea of relative space that I described above? A more general concept that removes more restrictions, that is what I'm after. What I really hope for is if the idea of coordinates is generalized away altogether to be replaced by something more general. Thanks for reading my question, I hope it made sense.",['geometry']
943394,How to draw $S^1\times I$,"I always thought $P=S^1\times I$, where $S^1$ is the circle and $I=(0,1)$ with the standard topology is the surface of the cylinder, but I was reading a book which says me another thing: Even, if the book is right, I didn't understand why $P$ is the open annulus, because the radius inside the annulus is not the same as $S^1$. So, why $P$ is not the surface of the cylinder? why $P$ is the open annulus? what the author said doesn't convince me. Thanks",['general-topology']
943429,Cardinal of a group $G$ such that for all $x\in G$ we have $x^2=e$,"Let $G$ be a group such that for all $x\in G$ we have $x^2=e$. Show that if $G$ is finite then the order of $G$ is $2^n$. Here is the solution I have seen in a book. If G is finite, it can be considered as a vector space over the field $\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$, and then necessarily is finite dimensional, which gives $G$ as a vector space isomorphic to $(\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z})^n$. I don't understand why $G$ can be considered as a vector space over the field $\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$. Can, someone, explain this? Please.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
943437,Is this AM-GM application correct?,"I have got an inequality down to proving that: if $a,b,c$ are positive reals that satisfy $a+b+c=1$, then $$\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{b}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{c}}\ge \frac{9+3\sqrt{3}}{2}$$
Here is my ""proof"":
Since $a,b,c$ are positive reals and $a+b+c=1$, then $0<a,b,c<1$. Thus $\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}$ etc are all positive, so we can use AM-GM to get $$\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{b}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{c}}\ge 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{(1-\sqrt{a})(1-\sqrt{b})(1-\sqrt{c})}}$$
Equality occurs if and only if $\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}=\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{b}}=\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{c}}$, i.e. $a=b=c$. Since $a+b+c=1$ it follows that equality occurs when $a=b=c=1/3$. Therefore (from our AM-GM application), the minimum value of $\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}+...$ is $3\left(\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{1/3}}\right)=\frac{9+3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So it follows that $$\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{a}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{b}}+\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{c}}\ge \frac{9+3\sqrt{3}}{2}$$
as required I'm not sure if this is correct, and would really appreciate if someone could check it for me. Thanks for your help!","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus', 'proof-verification']"

$(4+2\sqrt3)(\sqrt{2-\sqrt3})$ To this expression:
$\sqrt2+\sqrt6$ I tried to square $(4+2\sqrt3)$ and put it inside the radical, so:
$\sqrt{(16+12+16\sqrt3)(2-\sqrt3)}$ but eventually I get to: $\sqrt{52+32\sqrt3-28\sqrt3-48}$ and therefore $\sqrt{8+4\sqrt3}$ which will give me $2\sqrt{2+\sqrt3}$ From there I stopped because it didn't seem that I was getting anywhere. I checked on wolfram alpha and using the step-by-step solution the first thing that it does is:
""Express $2-\sqrt3$ as a square using $2-\sqrt3 = \frac{1-2\sqrt3+(\sqrt3)^2}{2}$ which is clearly correct and from there it is relatively easy to proceed to the solution. So my questions are: (1) what is that does not work in my method of putting the squared expression inside the radical (2) where can I fond more information on how to express a radical as a square, is there a procedure (something similar to completing the square for example)?

943530,"Chebyshev's theorem, is my answer correct to this question?","I was wondering if you guys could confirm if my answer is correct for this question regarding Chebyshev's theorem. A random variable $X$ has a mean of $\mu=5$ and a variance $\sigma^2=36$ (i.e.: a standard deviation of $\sigma=6$). Using Chebyshev's theorem, find the value of the constant $c$ such that
$$P(|x-5|\geq c)\leq 0.75$$ My answer was $\displaystyle c = 6 \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}$. Thought process: I first found the k value associated with a probability of .25 since this k value would tell me what range of data fall within 25% of the mean. After I obtained k, I just multiplied it by the standard deviation 6 and designated it as c since the probability of finding any random variable greater than c is going to be at max .75 since we are excluding all probabilities less than c.

943605,Powers of 2 in the product of the Fibonacci numbers,"I'm working on finding a summation that pulls the powers of 2 out of the product of the Fibonacci numbers. I've noticed some patterns for the Fibonacci number. For example. Looking at the Fibonacci numbers $${1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,....}$$
You notice that the pattern for powers of 2 is $$0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,3,....$$
So it is a kind of a recurring pattern but it's copying and pasting on itself. So I've tried to break it up into pieces. To label every where we see a power of 2 and what power those 2 are. Such as: $2^1: 3+6n$, $2^3: 6 +12n$, $2^4: 12 +24n$, $2^k: 3k+2kn$ But I can't seem to find a useable summation. To make sure I've made my point clear I'm trying to find an equation that does the same thing as this equation does for $n!$ I just want my summation to work on the product of the Fibonacci numbers. $$\sum_{k=1}^n\left\lfloor{\frac n{2^k}}\right\rfloor$$","['fibonacci-numbers', 'summation', 'number-theory']"
