1666396,Evaluate the infinite product $\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt[3]{1+\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt[4]{1+\frac{1}{4}} \cdots$,"I can show the convergence of the following infinite product and some bounds for it: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt[3]{1+\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt[4]{1+\frac{1}{4}} \cdots<$$ $$<\left(1+\frac{1}{4} \right)\left(1+\frac{1}{9} \right)\left(1+\frac{1}{16} \right)\cdots=\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2} \right)=\frac{\sinh \pi}{2 \pi}=1.83804$$ Here I used Euler's product for $\frac{\sin x}{x}$. The next upper bound is not as easy to evaluate, but still possible, taking two more terms in Taylor's series for $\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k} }$: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{k-1}{2k^4}+\frac{2k^2-3k+1}{6k^6} \right)=$$ $$=\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{2k^3}+\frac{5}{6k^4}-\frac{1}{2k^5}+\frac{1}{6k^6} \right)<$$ $$<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{108}+\frac{\pi^6}{5670}-1-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2}-\frac{\zeta (5)}{2} \right)=1.81654$$ The numerical value of the infinite product is approximately: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=1.758743628$$ The ISC found no closed from for this number. Is there some way to evaluate this product or find better bounds in closed form? Edit Clement C suggested taking logarithm and it was a very useful suggestion, since I get the series: $$\ln \prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}= \frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots$$ I don't know how to find the closed form, but I can certainly use it to find the boundaries (since the series for logarithm are very simple). $$\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots>\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^3}$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.72272$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{5}{6}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.77065$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{7}{12}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.75438$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{47}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.76048$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{37}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4} -\frac{\zeta (7)}{6}\right)=1.75803$$ This method generates much better bounds than my first idea. The last two are very good approximations. Edit 2 Actually, would it be correct to write (it gives the correct value of the product): $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\frac{1}{2} \exp \left( \sum_{k \geq 2} \frac{(-1)^k \zeta(k)}{k-1} \right)$$","['infinite-product', 'sequences-and-series']"

1666430,Missile Guidance Course Correction,"Background: I am controlling a simulated (programming) missile in a 2D space (no drag). The missile knows which direction it wants to go (the intended velocity vector direction). It is always accelerating along it's axis (the direction it is pointed) with some acceleration A. The missile cannot turn off its engine. It can only apply a torque to its body to change the direction it is facing, and thus change the direction its accelerating, and through this method only, change it's velocity vector. The goal is to be flying in the intended direction. It starts out in some random orientation with some (usually small) velocity. Goal Have the missile traveling in the intended direction for the remainder of the flight as quickly as possible . Mathy Recap All in 2D space so all vectors have (x y). Missile Acceleration A (how much the missile accelerates per second) Missile Angular Acceleration T (The rate at which we can increase our angular velocity) Current Direction Vector D (direction missile is facing and accelerating) Current Velocity Vector C (direction missile is traveling) Current Angular Velocity Y (how quickly is the missile spinning) Intended Velocity Vector V (direction missile wants to be traveling) Note: Application of + T or - T is the only way to control the missile. Example Bad Solutions Just rotate the missile so it is pointing in the right direction. This doesn't work because we will have some transverse velocity left over, and will never cancel it out. My Almost Solution: Just point the missile so D is equal to C mirrored across V so we cancel out the transverse velocity. Then, when C = V , just rotate back so D = V . This could work, but by the time the missile has rotated back so D = V , C has changed since we were pointing off of V while we rotated our missile back. The same peoblem will happen when we correct this new vector, and we will woble. I need a way to know when to start rotating back so that just when I reach D = V , the missiles acceleration has also made C = V . This seems like calculus since i need to know the total change (integral) of my vector over the time it takes to rotate back. And my rotational position is an acceleration curve itself since i cant just set velocity. Edit: A friend just informed me of PID's, which helps solve this problem, I'm not knowledgable enough to apply it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller","['vectors', 'euclidean-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"

I think it should be just a few lines, but I am totally stuck for two hour!  Please to help, thanks =) What I tried: Since $S$ is embedded, it can be covered with slice charts $U_p$.  If $V = \cup U_p$ then with bump functions we can make $S$ closed in $V$ by making it a level set.  But $V$ is open, so it does not mean $S$ is still closed in the whole manifold.

1666608,Likelihood Ratio Test for Exponential Distribution with a Limited Parameter Space,"Suppose that we are given an exponential distribution model with a pdf $f(x,\theta) = \theta^{-1}\exp(-x/\theta)$ with an iid sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, and we would like to test hypothesis $H_0 : \theta = 1$ and $H_1 : \theta > 1$. We shall investigate the limiting distribution of the likelihood test statistic $2n(l_n (\hat\theta) - l_n (1))$ where $l_n(\theta)$ is the log-likelihood function $\sum \log f(x,\theta$) and $\hat \theta$ is the MLE of $\theta$ in the parameter space. We shall investigate the asymptotic behavior of the test statistic. Note that the parameter space is not the whole real line, so it does not create an open neighborhood around $H_0: \theta = 1$). Here is what I have discovered so far: we know that the MLE of exponential distribution is $\overline X_n$, the sample mean if we are allowed to take the whole parameter space. Using a similar argument, if the sample mean is greater than one, the same argument works. However, if it is smaller than or equal to one, the MLE is 1 (we can show it using a monotonicity argument). Hence, the test statistic becomes $$\begin{cases}
2n(\ln \overline X_n - (\overline X_n - 1)) && \text{if $\overline X_n > 1$} \\
0 && \text{if $\overline X_n \leq 1$} \end{cases}$$ we can use then a taylor expansion for the first case to show that it is indeed approximately equal to $n(\overline X_n - 1)^2$ that has a $\chi^2$-distribution asymptotically. However, how can we incorporate the case where $\overline X_n \leq 1$? If $H_1$ were $\theta \neq 1$ it would have been safe and sound. I guess the test becomes $\sum \overline X_n > k$ for some $k$, due to the zero part for the second case?","['maximum-likelihood', 'statistics', 'hypothesis-testing', 'statistical-inference']"

u_n(x) = (1-n\operatorname{dist}(x,\partial U))^+$$

I was wondering if I could list all prime and irreducible elements of this ring, instead of just giving examples showing they are different sets. Since every element $x$ in $A$ divides a non zero integer (its norm $N(x):=x \cdot \overline{x}$), one can restrict the search to divisors of integers. For prime elements the situation is easy: almost by definition, we find all primes elements in $A$ as divisors of the primes in $\mathbb Z$. On sees that a primes $p\in \mathbb Z$ remains prime in $A$ iff $-3$ is not a square mod $p$ (this can be made more explicit using quadratic reciprocity...). If $-3$ is a square, we get two prime factors. For irreducible elements, can we make the list (as explicit as possible) of all such elements?

1667022,Is this function nowhere analytic?,"One usually sees $f(x):=\exp\frac{-1}{x^2}$ as an example of a $C^\infty$ function that is not analytic, having one point of non-analyticity (the point $0$). The Fabius function is a canonical example of a $C^\infty$ function that is non-analytic on a continuum. Consider now the (real) function $f(x)=\exp\frac{-1}{x^2}$ from above. With the understanding that $f$ is a bounded function and all derivatives of $f$ are bounded, define $$g(x):=\sum_n 2^{-n}\ f(x-a_n)$$ Where $a_n$ is an enumeration of $\mathbb Q$. We get again a $C^\infty$ function, as uniform convergence of the sum and of the sum of derivatives follows from all derivatives (of $f$) being bounded. It looks like $g$ is also nowhere analytic, since the points of non-analyticity of all the summands together is $\mathbb Q$, which is dense in $\mathbb R$ (if a function is analytic at $p$, there exists an open neighbourhood of $p$ on which it is also analytic). But a proof is something different, and maybe, since we are putting non-analyticities arbitrarily close together, the non-analytic parts cancel at some points. Is $g$ nowhere analytic?","['analyticity', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The number of members in each club is not divisible by $s$ (for a given $s$), but the number of people in the intersection of each two clubs is. Show that $m<cn$, where $c$ is the number of (distinct) primes that divide $s$. My ideas so far: I can solve this when $s=p^k$ for $p$ prime. In this case, consider the n-coordinate vectors $v_1,v_2..v_m$ such that the $j$ entry of $v_i$ is $1$ if the person number $j$ belongs to the club number $i$ and else it's $0$. If these vectors are LD over the rationals, they are also LD over the integers, ie, we can find integers $r_i$ such that $\sum_i r_i v_i=0$. We can assume that there is a $j$ such that $r_j$ is not a multiple of $p$, otherwise we divide everyone for $p$ until that happens. Taking inner product with $v_j$ we have $\sum_i r_i v_iv_j=0$. We have $p^k \mid r_iv_iv_j$ for all $i$ different from $j$, therefore $p^k\mid r_jv_jv_j$ which implies $p \mid r_j$, contradiction. So, the vectors are LI and $m\leq n$.

1667044,"If I take a Ring modulo a prime-like element, does it become a field?","Let's say we have a ring, $R$. We call an element $p$ of $R$ ""prime-like"" if for all $a$ and $b$ such that $p=ab$, exactly one of $a$ or $b$ is multiplicatively invertible. For example, in the integers, $-7$ is prime-like, because in $-7=-1*7$ and $-7=1*7$, exactly one of the terms is invertible. For real polynomials, $x^2+1$ is prime-like, because it can only be expressed as a product by $(\frac1ax^2+\frac1a)a$ for a nonzero constant $a$, and $a$ is invertible and $\frac1ax^2+\frac1a$ is not. Not that $0$ is never prime-like since $0=0*0$ (both are noninvertible), and an invertible element, $w$ is never prime-like since $w = w*1$ (both $w$ and $1$ are invertible). We take a ring modulo an element $r$ by taking an equivalence relation where $r_1=r_2$ in the new ring if there is an $r_3$ such that $r_1-r_2=r_3*r$ in the old ring. This new ring can be shown to in fact be a ring, and there is a ring homomorphism from the old ring to the new ring ($r$ gets mapped to $0$). If $r$ is prime-like, is the new ring a field? For example, if you take the integers modulo or a prime $p$ (which is the same as modulo $-p$), it becomes a prime finite field. If you take the real polynomials modulo $x^2+1$, you get the complex number field. Is it true in general that rings modulo prime-like elements are fields?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
1667068,On lifting an action of $G$ on $X$ to an action of $G'$ on $\tilde{X}$.,"I am reading the section on covering actions from Glen Bredon's Tranformation groups . Let $G$ be a Lie group (not necessarily connected) acting effectively/faithfully on a connected, locally path connected, semi-locally simply connected space $X$, not necessarily with fixed points. Let $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ be the universal covering of $X$. For any $g\in G$, $\theta_g:X\to X$ is the map given by $x\mapsto g\cdot x$. Now he makes the following statement - $\theta_g$ can be covered by a homeomorphism of $\tilde{X}$ since $\tilde{X}$ is simply connected, and any two such liftings differ by a deck transformation. Clearly, all such liftings for all $g$ form a subgroup $G'$ of $\operatorname{Homeo}(\tilde{X})$. My question is how do we get such a homeomorphism of $\tilde{X}$? I think it should be by general lifting theorem. So for a choice of base point $x_0\in X$ and $x'_0\in\tilde{X}$ such that $p(x'_0)=g\cdot x_0$ there will be a unique homeomorphism from $\tilde{X}\to\tilde{X}$ sending $x'_0$ to itself.

Define a map $\alpha:\mathbb{C}[V]→\mathbb{C}[W]$ by $\alpha(f)=f\circ\psi$.

To show that it is surjective, we see that for any $g\in\mathbb{C}[W]$, $f=g\circ \phi$ is sent to $g\circ \phi\circ\psi=g$ by $\alpha$. Now we show that $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.

1667918,Toroidal Harmonics?,"So I end up with an interesting (at least for me) problem. It is probably very basic and someone out there might have solved this with a pencil behind their ear. Nevertheless, indulge me for a moment while I share my mathematical adventures with all of you and ask for wisdom. So I have a manifold $R = (\theta, \phi, W(\theta, \phi))$ where $\theta,\phi \in [-\pi,\pi]$ and $W \in \mathbb{R}$. I want to be able to find the metric tensor of this manifold at every point but to do that I need a way to write the function $W(\theta,\phi)$. I was thinking on writing $W$ as a linear combination of orthonormal functions of a complete set $\{f_k\}$ such that: $$
W(\theta, \phi) = \sum_k c_k f_k (\theta ,\phi)
$$ My own mathematical immaturity led me to think about the Spherical Harmonics, however I learned that the angular coordinates used by Spherical Harmonics are not the same as my own. This, as it later became obvious, is because the coordinates in the Spherical Harmonics are (rather unsurprisingly) spherical , whereas my particular system of coordinates seems to be somewhat toroidal . So the way I see it, I need some kind of ""toroidal harmonics"". A set of functions defined in the toroidal coordinates that are complete on the ""unit Torus"" (is that how you call it when only the angles are allowed to vary?) in the same fashion that the spherical harmonics are complete on the unit sphere. Looking around I found out that there are functions called ""Toroidal Functions"". That looked promising for a moment but as far as I could tell, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, maybe it was but I didn't manage to understand it. I got stuck after that and didn't really find any complete set on a Torus. Maybe there aren't any or maybe I don't actually need one and everything I said here is kinda stupid.

Question: Is this property local on the target? (I know that the more general EGA definition - namely a morphism which is relative proj of the some generated in degree 1 sheaf of graded algebras -  does not have this property. I don't understand the reason why this is so.) At first I thought so, but then I realized that the closed embeddings into relative $\mathbb{P}^n$ don't necessarily glue to a closed embedding into relative projective space, since there maybe nontrivial twisting. I didn't see any mention of this in Hartshorne, so I guess it is not true. What is the real deal? (Is there some good circumstance when it is target local?)",['algebraic-geometry']

Of course the path boundary of $K$ is contained in the boundary of $K$, and it is not hard to find a set whose path boundary is a strict subset of its boundary.  Take for example the block $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$, and remove the sets $\left\{(x,y):y>0,\dfrac{1}{n^2}<x<\dfrac{2}{n^2}\right\}$, for $n\geq2$.  The resulting set $K$ is compact (countably many open sets have been removed), and the set $\{(0,y):0\leq y<1\}$ is contained in the boundary of $K$ but not in the path boundary of $K$. My question is : Is there a nice characterization of the sets for which the path boundary is equal to the boundary?  Even a characterization for the case in which both $K$ and $K^c$ are connected would be welcome. As a cautionary tale, I will say that the answer cannot depend just on smoothness of $\partial K$, since if $g:[0,1]\to[0,\infty)$ is any continuous function, then the path boundary of the set $K=\{(x,y):0\leq x\leq1,0\leq y\leq g(x)\}$ is equal to the boundary of $K$, and of course this $K$ can have quite jagged boundary.

This didn't work. I'd like to know why and what can I do to find $w$.","['transformation', 'linear-algebra', 'geometry']"

1668774,Parametrising the Clebsch cubic,"The Clebsch cubic surface is a famous cubic surface whose 27 lines are all defined over the real numbers. It can be described as the solution set of the equation (in homogeneous coordinates) $$x^3+y^3+z^3+w^3 =(x+y+z+w)^3 \quad (\ast)$$ On the other hand, like any cubic surface, it is parametrised by the four-dimensional space of cubic curves passing through six given points in the plane. In this special case the points are the vertices of a pentagon together with its centre. Choosing a basis $(f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4)$ for that space gives a rational map $\mathbf P^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbf P^3$  sending $x$ to $(f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x), f_4(x))$, and blowing up the six base points makes this an isomorphism onto its image. For an arbitrary choice of basis of this space, the image will be projectively equivalent to the Clebsch cubic, but it won't be exactly the solution set of the above equation. Question: How do we choose $(f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4)$ so that the image of this map is exactly the solution set of the equation $(\ast)$ above? Note that intersecting the Clebsch surface with any of the coordinate planes in $\mathbf P^3$, we get a cubic curve which is a union of three lines. But this curve is the same as the solution set of $f_i=0$, unless it contains one of the exceptional lines. So each of the $f_i$ should be a product of 3 linear forms, or the union of a conic through 5 of the 6 points and a line through 2 of the 6 points, only one of which lies on the conic. I guess there is a simple brute-force method to answer this question, as follows: pick any basis for the space of cubic curves, find the degree-3 equation they satisfy, find the necessary linear transformation to put that in Clebsch form, then apply that transformation to the elements of the original basis. But there is something repugnant about that way of solving it: the setup of the problem is so beautiful and symmetric that one ought to be able to find the answer ""by pure thought"". However, I have failed to do that so far. Please enlighten me!",['algebraic-geometry']
