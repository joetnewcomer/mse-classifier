1177817,Can a symmetric matrix become non-symmetric by changing the basis?,"We know that a hermitian matrix is a matrix which satisfies $A=A^*$ , where $A^*$ is the conjugate transpose. A symmetric matrix (special case of hermitian - with real entries) is one for which $A=A^T$ . Observation: this property is dependent on choice of basis. We know that we can even choose a basis where these matrices are diagonal (spectral theorem). So, my question is: Is this observation correct? Can we choose a basis where such matrices are not hermitian  or symmetric? If so, is there a characterization of operators whose matrices can be hermitian or symmetric in some basis? The following is a paragraph from wiki page which I'm unable to understand. Can someone shed light on this? ... Denote by $ \langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle $ the standard inner product on $R^n$ . The real $n-by-n$ matrix $A$ is symmetric if and only if $\langle Ax,y \rangle = \langle x, Ay\rangle \quad \forall x,y\in\Bbb{R}^n$ . Since this definition is independent of the choice of basis, symmetry is a property that depends only on the linear operator A and a choice of inner product. This characterization of symmetry is useful, for example, in differential geometry, for each tangent space to a manifold may be endowed with an inner product, giving rise to what is called a Riemannian manifold. Another area where this formulation is used is in Hilbert spaces...","['symmetric-matrices', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'hermitian-matrices']"

1177845,Radius of convergence of a power serise involving the Fibonacci sequence.,"Consider the power series $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nz^n.$$ where, $a_0=0$ , $a_1=1$ , $a_n=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ . Find the radius of convergence of the power series. MY Attempt : Clearly $\{a_n\}$ is a Fibonacci sequence. Let, $R$ be the radius of convergence of the power series. We have , $$\frac{1}{R}=\lim_n\sup\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|$$ $$=\lim_n\sup\left|\frac{a_n+a_{n-1}}{a_n}\right|$$ $$1+\lim_n\sup\left|\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\right|.$$ But I can't write $\lim_n\sup\left|\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\right|$ in terms of $R$ such that we can find out $R$ by solving the equation involving $R$ . Again we know that the $n$ -th term of Fibonacci sequence is $$a_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt 5}\left[\left(\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}\right)^n-\left(\frac{1-\sqrt 5}{2}\right)^n\right].$$ From this I find that the radius of convergence of the power series is $\frac{2}{1+\sqrt 5}$ . Is this answer correct ? If NOT what is the correct answer ? But I want to find the radius of convergence NOT using the $n$ -th term of Fibonacci sequence. How I can find it ? Please help...

1177875,Solve Laplace's equation inside a semi-infinite strip,"Solve $$\frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial y^{2}} = 0$$ $$0 < x < \infty, \ \ 0 < y < H$$ subject to these boundary conditions: $${\frac {\partial u} {\partial y}} (x,0)=0$$ $${\frac {\partial u} {\partial y}} (x,H)=0$$ $$u(0,y)=f(y)$$
This is what I found and I understand it but is this the answer? You will want to solve this using separation of variables. Then ∇2(XY)=X′′(x)Y(y)+X(x)Y′′(y)=0 so that X′′X+Y′′Y=0.Hence X′′=CX,  Y′′=−CY for some real constant C (known as a separation constant). The values of C we need to take depend on the boundary conditions, which are: X(0)=1, limx→∞X(x)=0 ,Y(0)=Y(h)=0 with Y(y) not identically zero (actually all that's required is X(0)≠0, but it is convenient to specify X(0)=1). The easiest boundary condition to satisfy is that X(x)→0 as x→∞. We must have X(x)=$e^{−kx}$ for some k>0. This means that C=k$^2$ so that Y′′=−$k^2$Y subject to Y(0)=Y(h)=0 but with Y(y) not identically zero. That can be done if we take k=(nπ)/h for some positive integer n with Y(y)=Bsin(nπyh) where the constant B cannot be determined from the boundary conditions on Y. But given the next stage of the solution we may as well take B=1. Putting this together, we have, for each positive integer n, an eigenfunction $X_n$(x)$Y_n$(y)=exp(−nπxh)sin(nπyh) and the natural thing to do is to take a linear combination of these, u(x,y)=∑$a_n$exp(−nπxh)sin(nπyh), and choose the coefficients an to satisfy the boundary condition u(0,y)=f(y). We then have f(y)=u(0,y)=∑$a_n$sin(nπyh) which is the fourier sine series for f(y) on the interval 0≤y≤h. Thus $a_n$= 2/h ∫f(y)sin(nπyh)dy.

1178036,Existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration,"I am trying to understand the proof of the existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration from Huybrechts and Lehn. Let $X$ be a projective scheme with a fixed ample line bundle. Then the theorem says that every pure sheaf  has a unique Harder-Narasimhan filtration. The book first proves the following lemma : let $E$ be a purely $d$-dimensional sheaf. Then there is a subsheaf $F\subset E$ such that for all subsheaves $G\subset E$ one has $p(F)\geq p(G) $ and in case of equality $G\subset F$. Moreover $F$ is uniquely determined and semistable. $F$ is the maximal destabilizing subsheaf. My doubt is as follows. Once we establish the existence of such an $F$, the book says by induction we can assume that $E/F$ has a Harder Narasimhan filtration. What are we inducting on? My guess is the dimension of the sheaf $E$. But if so I am not able to see why dimension of $E/F$ is strictly less than dimension of $ E$.

We checked all choices of the capacities under $100$ and in all cases the longest shortest path (the diameter of the graph) has length (number of edges, which is same as number of pouring steps) at most $A+1$. Without the initial water restriction, the solution length might well be unbounded. I do know that the graph is best studied in barycentric coordinates, and then a pouring sequence corresponds to a billiard path in a certain polygon. Example for $A+1$:  Use jugs $(A,A,2)$ where $A$ is odd. The shortest path from $(A,0,0)$ to $(A-1,1,0)$ takes $A+1$ steps. I will soon submit a demo to the Wolfram site that shows the graph and the solution for any choice of jugs, start, and finish. Stan Wagon","['graph-theory', 'puzzle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1178584,Stefan-Boltzmann Constant and Stefan's Law,"The following argument is from my textbook, An Introduction to Thermal Physics by Daniel Schroeder. If you are familiar with the derivation of Stefan's Law from the energy density of a photon gas, you can scroll down to the bottom where I state my question. I am looking for a more simple explanation for the result of the following derivation. Using Bose-Einstein statistics, we have derived that the energy density of a photon gas is 
$$\frac{U}{V} = \frac{8\pi^5}{15} \frac{(kT)^4}{(hc)^3}$$
We would like to now understand how photons are emitted from an idealized black body. Consider a box filled with a photon gas with a hole of area $A$ on one side. We are concerned with computing the amount of energy that escapes per unit time. The photons that escape the hole during a time interval $dt$ were once pointed at the hole from somewhere within a hemispherical shell centered at the hole. Say the shell has radius $R$. The thickness of the shell is $c$ $dt$. Below is a diagram of a cross-section of the described situation. The shaded chunk of the shell has volume
$$\text{volume of chunk} = R \, d\theta \times r \sin \theta \, d\phi \times c \, dt$$
where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle not shown (it ranges from $0$ to $2 \pi$, and can be thought of revolving the semi-circle around its central axis). Assuming a uniform density of photons in the box, the energy in the chunk is just the energy density above times the volume of this chunk:
$$\text{energy in chunk} = \frac{U}{V} c dt R^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi$$
However, not all of the energy in this chunk will escape through the hole. Assume the photons in the chunk are have random directions. The probability of any single photon escaping through the hole is equal to the apparent area of the hole (as viewed from the chunk's location) divided by the total area of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the chunk (i.e. the total area of the places the photon could end up).
$$\text{probability of escape} = \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi R^2}$$
Therefore, the energy that escapes from this chunk is
$$\text{energy escaping from chunk} = \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi} \frac{U}{V} c dt \sin \theta d\theta d\phi$$
We can find the total energy escaping by integrating over all hemispherical angles
$$\text{total energy escaping} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi} \frac{U}{V} c \sin \theta d\theta = \frac{A}{4} \frac{U}{V} c dt$$ This final result gives us Stefan's law:
$$\text{power per unit area} = \frac{c}{4} \frac{U}{V} = \frac{2 \pi^5}{15} \frac{(kT)^4}{h^3 c^2} = \sigma T^4$$ We went through all of this trouble just to find that the power emitted per unit area is equal to the energy density times the speed of light, divided by four. The factor $c$ makes sense: the photons (which are carrying the energy) are traveling at that speed, so the rate of energy emission should be proportional to $c$ times the energy density. So, the only non-obvious thing the geometric derivation provided is the factor $\frac{1}{4}$. My question is... ..is there a simpler explanation for this factor of $\frac{1}{4}$? Is there some sort of symmetry argument? Or do you have to deal with integrating over all these angles?","['mathematical-physics', 'geometry', 'alternative-proof']"

1178603,Cubes and Subcubes,"I just need my work to be checked. I've got the following problem: Take a cube. It is colored red on the outside and white on the inside. Split it into 27 subcubes. Put them in a bag, shake the bag, and put one subcube on a table. You see that the five visible faces of the subcube are all white. What's the probability that this in the interior subcube (i.e. the one with no red sides)? Here's my work: Let $I$ be the event that the subcube is the interior cube. Let $S$ be the event that the subcube shows five white sides. We're trying to find $P(I|S)$. By Bayes' Rule, $$P(I|S) = \frac{P(S|I)\cdot P(I)}{P(S)}$$ And clearly $P(S|I) = 1$, and $P(I) = \frac 1 {27}$. So: $$P(I|S) = \frac{1/27}{P(S)}$$ To compute $P(S)$, we enumerate the possibilities. There is $1$ interior subcube that shows 6 white sides. There are $6$ center subcubes that show $5$ white sides. There are $8$ corner subcubes that show $3$ white sides. There are $12$ edge subcubes that show $4$ white sides. The corner and edge subcubes don't show enough white sides. The interior subcube shows $5$ white sides with probability $1$. We have a $\frac 1 {27}$ chance of selecting the interior subcube. The center subcube shows $5$ white sides with probability $\frac 5 6$. The probability of selecting a center subcube is $\frac 6 {27}$. So the probability of selecting a center subcube and it showing 5 white sides is $\frac 6 {27} \cdot \frac 5 6 = \frac 5 {27}$. Add the chance of selecting the interior subcube, and we have that $P(S) = \frac 6 {27}$. So $$P(I|S) = \frac{1/27}{6/27} = \frac 1 6$$ As expected. But I've been told that this is not the right answer. Can anyone look over my proof to see if I'm mistaken somehow?","['discrete-mathematics', 'probability', 'proof-verification']"

Improve this question Plus, minus, multiply, divide, and exponentiation all have symbols in math (+, -, *, /, ^ ) . But why isn't there the missing log symbol too? Here's how it would work: 4 ^ 5 = 1024 (as is standard for exponentiation) 1024 _ 4 = 5 (""_"" is the new log operator!) Look how much more elegant <1> is compared to <2>, <3> or <4>. We shouldn't need to do those 'hacks' to express the same thing: 1: 1024 _ 4 = 5 2: log(1024)/log(4) = 5 3: LogBase(1024,4) = 5 4: log4(1024) = 5 NB: It doesn't have to be an underscore symbol. It's just the first thing that sprang to mind. Having a binary log operator would be useful for visually parsing the sum due to its conciseness. Additionally, using root symbols (for exponentiation's other inverse) eats up vertical space, and I think there's value in being able to express a sum on a single line.

Now let $X$ be a topological space and let $Y$ be the set of point in the topological space $Y$ above. Munkre's states that if $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a surjective map then there is exactly one topology on $Y$ relative to which $f$ is a quotient map and it's the quotient topology defined by: $U$ is open in $Y$ if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.

1179407,Let $\theta=\frac{2 \pi}{67}$ consider the rotation matrix $A$. What is $A^{2010}$?,"Let $\theta=\frac{2 \pi}{67}$. Consider the matrix
  $$A = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta  & \sin\theta\\ 
 -\sin \theta&  \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix} $$
  Then the matrix $A^{2010}$ is? My approach $$A^2 = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos2\theta  & \sin2\theta\\ 
 -\sin 2\theta&  \cos 2\theta
\end{pmatrix} $$ $2010$ is a multiple of $67$. So I'm trying to convert in such format by taking $A$ matrix as power of $2$ and multiplying. But $2048$ is the nearest $2$ power term. So help please. I dont know if you can understand what I did!! Sorry for being not explaining properly","['matrices', 'trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1179442,How is $RN =\frac{2}{3}BC$ in this rectangle?,I tried this question first by letting $AB = 6p$ and $BC = 6q$. Then I let $R$ the midpoint of $GB$ and $N$ the midpoint of $FE$. I got stuck so I looked at the memo for a hint and it turns out I followed the memo exactly but the next step said that $RN = \frac{2}{3}BC$. How is this true? I couldn't get that into my head. Can someone please explain?,['geometry']
1179459,Utility of the 2-Categorical Structure of $\mathsf{Top}$?,"It's well known that $\mathsf{Top}$ is a 2-category with homotopy classes of homotopies as 2-arrows. I'm a bit afraid to ask this question, but what is the utility of this 2-categorical structure? Certainly, homotopy is an invaluable notion, and one might say the 2-categorical structure is what enables homotopy theory, but I don't know enough to have a reply to that; It just doesn't seem like basic topology and algebraic topology make use of the ""entire"" 2-categorical structure of $\mathsf{Top}$ (or $\mathsf{Ch}_\bullet$). Examples of constructions or results that really require the 2-categorical structure (something that actually requires the interchange law, for instance) would be much appreciated!","['general-topology', 'category-theory', 'homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"
