285866,Calculating circle radius from two points on circumference (for game movement),"I'm designing a game where objects have to move along a series of waypoints.  The object has a speed and a maximum turn rate.  When moving between points p1 and p2 it will move in a circular curve like so: Angle a is the angle the object must rotate through.  Therefore we can calculate the time it will take to rotate through this angle as t = a / turn rate . However, if the object's current speed means it will cover distance d in quicker than this time, it must slow down on this corner or it will miss p2.  I need to calculate the maximum speed it can take this corner at, which means calculating the distance of the curve d (so I can calculate the maximum corner speed as d / t ). I think I've figured out b = 2a , but to determine d I need to know the radius of the circle.  How can I determine it from this information?","['geometry', 'triangles', 'circles']"
285875,normalize subgroup,if we have normal subgroups $N \lhd G$ and $G_i \lhd G_{i+1}$ it says the reason that $NG_i \lhd NG_{i+1}$ is that $N$ and $G_{i+1}$ both normalize $NG_i$ inside $G$. What does it mean for a group to normalize a group inside a group? And/or can you give me some idea about why $NG_i \lhd NG_{i+1}$? Is that just saying that $NG_i$ is normal in $N$ and $NG_i$ is normal in $G_{i+1}$ so you can combine it to get $NG_i$ normal in $NG_{i+1}$? but how do we prove both these facts. source 3.3 http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/grouptheory/subgpseries1.pdf,['group-theory']
285877,Continuity of the function $g(e^{it})=f(t)$ defined on $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$,"$f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ continuous and $2\pi $ periodic. In Harro Heuser: Analysis 2 (page 65) it is left to the reader to show that the function $g(e^{it})=f(t)$ defined by : $$g: S\rightarrow \mathbb{C}; S=\{z\in \mathbb{C} ||z|=1 \}  $$ is continuous What I have tried: continuous maps under continuous functions are again continuous so it is enough if one shows that $y(t) = e^{it}$ is continuous on $t\in[0,2\pi]$ $\lim_{t\rightarrow a } e^{it} = e^{ia}$ is true because : $$|e^{it}-e^{ia}|= |e^{ia}|\cdot|e^{(t-a)}-1| = |t-a+\frac{(t-a)^2}{2!}+...| $$$$ = |t-a|\cdot|1+\frac{t-a}{2!}+\frac{(t-a)^2}{3!}...| \le |t-a|\cdot |e^{t-a}|$$ so in a compact neighbourhood we can bound $e^{it}$  and $|t-a|$ and $|e^{it}-e^{ia}|$ can be chosen arbitrarily small Is this correct?

285895,General Solution to Quasilinear PDE using Method of Characteristics,"This is a homework that I'm having a bit of trouble with.  I posted it previously but there was a typo in my original post.  Since I received an answer for the incorrect problem it was suggested that I post the correct problem as a new question: Find a general solution of: $(x^2+3y^2+3u^2)u_x-2xyu_y+2xu=0~.$ Of course this is to be done using the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are: $\dfrac{dx}{x^2+3y^2+3z^2}=-\dfrac{dy}{2xy}=-\dfrac{dz}{2xz}$ The idea is to find two functions, say $\phi$ and $\psi$, that are independent (the gradients are not colinear) and that are constant along the characteristics. We can then express the general solution as F($\phi$,$\psi$)=0 where F is an arbitrary $C^1$ function.  It is easy to find that $\psi=\dfrac{y}{z}=const$.  Finding a suitable $\phi$ is what I'm having trouble with.  I tried substituting $\dfrac{y}{const}$ for $z$ in the $dx$ equation and solving for $\dfrac{dx}{dy}$ but the resulting ODE has no obvious (to me) method of solution.

The motivation of this question is that I've come to a problem where I am to find the dual bases corresponding to a certain bases of some space V.

285927,"Doesn't Abhyankar's lemma contradict faithful flat descent (no, but I'm confused)","Let $O_K$ be a dvr with fraction field $K$. Let $L/K$ be a tamely ramified finite Galois extension. Then, Abhyankar's Lemma implies that there exists a finite Galois extension $K^\prime/K$ such that the compositum $L^\prime$ of $K^\prime$ and $L$ is unramified over $K^\prime$. (This statement is wrong: QiL explains that one must normalize) In other words, we're starting with a finite flat surjective morphism $Spec \ O_L\to Spec \ O_K$. Then, we make a base change along the morphism $Spec \ O_{K^\prime}\to  Spec \ O_K$ and obtain an etale morphism $Spec \ O_{L^\prime} \to Spec \ O_{K^\prime}$.

285931,Age of Stochasticity?,"Today I came across D. Mumford's 1999 article The Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity , which is quite remarkable even after more than a decade. The title already indicates the theme, but I copy the abstract for the convenience of the reader: For over two millennia, Aristotle's logic has ruled over the thinking of western intellectuals. All precise theories, all scientific models, even models of process of thinking itself, have in principle conformed to the straight-jacket of logic. But from its shady beginnings devising gambling strategies and counting corpses in medieval London, probability theory and statistical interference now emerges as better foundations for scientific models, especially those of the process of thinking and as essential ingredients of theoretical mathematics, even foundation of mathematics itself. We propose that this sea change in our perspective will affect virtually all of mathematics in the next century. In the article he proposes a new approach to mathematical science, putting random variables and stochasticity into foundations of mathematics (rather than building them upon measure theory), especially in theory of differential equations and artificial intelligence. I am wondering how is this program going? I know something about stochastic differential equations from finance, and I know probability theory is fundamental to machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, it seems to me stochasticity is still far from the foundations of mathematics, and much mathematics is still ruled by logic. Of course as an undergraduate maybe I am just too far from the frontier. So can someone tell me how is this program going? Is it really some advantage in this new approach Mumford proposed?

285956,"Why is $\int\limits_{1}^{n} \log x \,dx \le \sum\limits_{x = 1}^{n}\log x$?","It has been a long time since I studied integrals, so this question may sound stupid. I was going through this wiki page, and came across the following inequality: $$\int_{1}^{n} \log x \,dx \le \sum_{x = 1}^{n}\log x$$ Why is this inequality true? Now, my understanding is that the integral on the left side is the area under the curve of $y = \log x$ from $x = 1 \text{ to } n$. Also, this curve is always increasing, and non-negative in $[1 \dots \infty)$. As for the summation, it can be graphically/geometrically represented as rectangles of width 1 on the X-axis, and height $\log x$ for integral values of $x$. So, $\log 3$ can be represented as a rectangle from $x = 3 \text{ to } 4$ of height $\log 3$. Then the summation is the total area of these rectangles. Since the last rectangle goes upto $n+1$, it is beyond the upper limit of the integral. Apart from that, all other rectangles have area lesser than the corresponding sections of the curve (since it is non-negative and increasing in the any section after $x = 1$). So, we get the obvious inequality: $$\int_{1}^{n} \log x \,dx \ge \sum_{x = 1}^{n-1}\log x$$ How does the addition of the $\log n$ term to the right hand side change the inequality? How can the first inequality be proven?","['logarithms', 'inequality', 'integration', 'summation']"

There is another answer on math.stackexchange which claims that the best you can do with 3 dice is $p = 0.58$, which is disappointingly close to $0.5$; for a teaching aid you need to be able to beat students almost every time for them to spot the pattern quickly. Efron's dice are substantially better at $2/3$, but is that really the best we can do?

Still, it would be nice to know what the ""simplest""/smallest set of ""simple"" dice is that gets you above, say, 70%, 72%, etc. Also, assuming that the other player doesn't yet understand what's going on, a uniform nontransitive probability of $75%$ - $\epsilon$ can still be improved by making some dice lose with probability > $75$%, so that if the other player chooses randomly from the dice, the will get beaten on average much more than $75$% of the time. The ""worse"" choices can be encouraged by making the highest number on them very high. As far as I understand the proof in this answer , this possibility is not excluded.",['probability-theory']

286203,Vertices and edges of a cube are assigned natural numbers in a particular way; can the sum of the vertices equal the sum of the edges?,"At the vertices of a cube are written 8 different natural numbers, and on each of its edges is written the greatest common divisor of the numbers at the endpoints of the edge. Can the sum of the numbers written at the vertices be the same as the sum of the numbers written at the edges? I have no idea where to go with this question. Here are some ideas: There is a mistake in the above picture. I missed out two edges, b and c. The vertices can be arranged in this manner, where no letter past a is equal to one. All of the terms cancel out except for abc+ some vertex V for the sum of the vertices, and a+b+c+unknown edges x+y+z which all depend on what value to give V. I cannot decide this at all. Other ideas presented to me, as well was what I believe, is that this just is not possible. However, I have no way of proving that. Here are some ideas from another who tried this with me: Clearly, if there were only as many edges as vertices it would never work, as the value of a connecting edge must be smaller than at least one of its vertex values. In the best case scenario one vertex is a and the other ab, then you get an edge value of a, but the vertex ab is necessarily bigger. However, there are more edges than vertices, so one might hope to get some clever settings which work out. Here some ideas against that hope:
You can't have just the majority of vertices being primes, because then two connected primes only give you a 1 on the edge and so to beat all the vertex primes, you'd need a couple of very bid edges. To get big edges you need at least one big vertex which isn't prime, so we conclude that there must be some bigger vertex somewhere. But, say one big vertex is ab with b>a with a=>2.There are only three outgoing edges, so to not lose, you want all of them carry the b. But then the other side of these edges must be bc with c>2. Hence all the vertices together are somethink like (a+c+d+e)*d and the edges are only 3b. This is no proof, but an argument against a vertex with only two prime factors. But then I played around and and saw that vertices the number 2*3*5 is really the only one that wins over it's edges Please help!",['discrete-mathematics']

286233,"$f$ bounded on $[a,b]$ with one or finite discontinuities implies $f$ Riemann-integrable.","I have two problems: Prove that if $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$ and has exactly one discontinuity in $[a, b]$ then $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$. Prove that if $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$ and $f$ has only finitely many discontinuities in $[a, b]$ then $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$. I have a possible proof for the first one which I would like checked: Theorem 6.1 states that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$ iff given any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ with $U(P, f) - L(P, f) < \varepsilon$. Theorem 6.2 states that if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ then it is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$. Suppose $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$. Then by definition there exists $M > 0$ such that $\vert f(x) \vert \leq M$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. Suppose $f$ has exactly one discontinuity in $[a, b]$ call it $c$. Without loss of generality suppose $c \in (a, b)$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Choose $\delta > 0$ such that $\displaystyle \delta = \frac{\varepsilon}{12M}$. Observe that $f$ is continuous on $[a, c - \delta]$ and $[c + \delta, b]$. By Theorem 6.2 $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, c - \delta]$ and $[c + \delta, b]$. By Theorem 6.1 there exists a partition $P_1$ of $[a, c - \delta]$ with $U(P_1, f) - L(P_1, f) < \varepsilon/3$. Again, by Theorem 6.1 there exists a partition $P_2$ of $[c + \delta, b]$ with $U(P_2, f) - L(P_2, f) < \varepsilon/3$. Define $P = P_1 \cup P_2$. Now observe that 
          \begin{align*}
			U(P, f) &=  U(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot \sup_{x \in [c - \delta, c+ \delta]} f(x) + U(P_2, f) \\
			&\leq U(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot M + U(P_2, f)
		\end{align*}
  and 
          \begin{align*}
			L(P, f) &= L(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot \inf_{x \in [c - \delta, c+ \delta]} f(x) + L(P_2, f)\\
			& \geq L(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot (-M) + L(P_2, f) 
		\end{align*}
  which is implies $$-L(P, f) \leq - L(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot M - L(P_2, f) $$ Hence we have
          \begin{align*}
			U(P, f) - L(P, f) &\leq U(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot M + U(P_2, f) - L(P_1, f) + 2\delta \cdot M - L(P_2, f)\\
			&= \big[U(P_1, f) - L(P_1, f) \big] + 4 \delta \cdot M + \big[U(P_2, f) - L(P_2, f)\big]\\
			&< \frac\varepsilon3 + 4M\frac{\varepsilon}{12M} + \frac\varepsilon3\\
			&= \frac\varepsilon3 +\frac\varepsilon3 +\frac\varepsilon3 \\
			&= \varepsilon
		\end{align*}
          Thus by Theorem 6.1 we can conclude that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$. My question namely is: is it sufficient to check that $c \in (a, b)$ or should I explicitly show that it holds when the discontinuity is on the endpoints? For the second problem, I am thinking of using induction on the first problem, but I haven't seen an induction problem done like that so I don't know how to get started.

As I can see, when $x\to-\infty$, the numerator tends to $-1$ and denominator tends to $-\infty$, so the whole expression tends to $0$. But when $x\to+\infty$, the whole expression becomes indeterminate form of $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Well, $\lim\limits_{x\to+\infty}\frac{a^x-1}{x} = \lim\limits_{x\to+\infty}\frac{a^x}{x} - \lim\limits_{x\to+\infty}\frac{1}{x} = \lim\limits_{x\to+\infty}\frac{a^x}{x}$. Intuitively (and well proved by l'HÃ´pital's rule) $\frac{a^x}{x}\to+\infty$ when $x\to+\infty$. But this rule is discussed later in the book, so I'm supposed to prove this statement by means of intuitive definition of limit or so. Since $x\to+\infty$, there must be preassigned positive $M$ conforming to $|\frac{a^x}{x}|>M$ when $x>N$, for any preassigned positive $N$. If we express $M$ in terms of $N$: $M=\frac{a^N}{N}$, we can see, that for any $N>0$ there is such $M$. So, by definition, $\lim\limits_{x\to+\infty}\frac{a^x}{x}=+\infty$.

286617,Trigonometric diophantine equation $8\sin^2\left(\frac{(k+1)\pi}{n}\right)=n\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$,"Background. I thought up the problem of finding a regular $n$-sided polygon that has a diagonal with length $d_k$ such that the area of the polygon equals ${d_k}^2$. (Let $d_k$ denote the length of a diagonal that skips $k$ vertices, so that $d_0$ is the length of a side.) By doing some trigonometry I got the equation $$8\sin^2\left(\frac{(k+1)\pi}{n}\right)=n\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right).$$ I have checked some values of $n$ and it seems that $(4,0)$ and $(12,3)$ are the only (primitive and non-trivial) possible values for $(n,k)$. Question. Are there other solutions? One approach could be rewriting the equation using $\sin(x)=\frac i2(e^{-ix}-e^{ix})$. This gives $$4(\zeta_n^{k+1}+\zeta_n^{-k-1})-in(\zeta_n+\zeta_n^{-1})=8,$$ where $\zeta_n=e^{2\pi i/n}$. Update. Except for $n=4$, we have $n=4p$ with $p\equiv3\pmod4$ prime.

If $f:\mathbb{R}^1\to \mathbb{R}^2$ is of class $C^1$ mapping, show that $f$ does not carry $\mathbb{R}^1$ onto $\mathbb{R}^2$. I know that if suppose that $f$ is onto, then let $g$ be a right inverse of $f$ where $f(g(x,y))=x$.  If I differentiate $f(g(x,y))=x$, using the chain rule, i get some expression, but there is a problem because i am not sure if $g(x,y)$ is itself differentiable to begin with. Alternatively, if i let the mapping of $f$ be written as $f(t)=(\phi_1(t), \phi_2(t))$, then the Jacobian matrix $Df(t)$ is a $2$ by $1$ matrix.  So the column rank of $Df(t)$ is $1$.  But how can i use this information to conclude that $f$ is not onto, since if $f$ were onto in the first place, won't the column rank of its Jacobian be equal to the dimension of the function's codomain.

I desperately need someone to briefly answer below 3 questions... **For convenience, i will write Lebesgue Measurable set to mean the usual Lebesgue Measurable set, and write Codable-Lebesgue Measurable set to mean the Lebesgue Measurable set defined by Codable-Borel sets. $1$. It is well-known that ""Existence of Non-Lebesgue measurable set is unprovable in ZF"". WHAT Lebesgue measurable set? My definition for Lebesgue measurable set is defined by using Riesz Representation Theorem (Whose existence is guranteed by Axiom of Countable Choice, hence it is undefinable without choice). However, I heard that the usual construction of Lebesgue measure is by using Caratheodory's existence theorem. In that way, can Lebesgue measurable set be definable without Axiom of Choice? That is, it really doesn't make sense to me, 'existence of non-Lebesgue Measurable set is unprovable in ZF' since Lebesgue measure cannot be defined without choice (in my way of construction of Lebesgue measure). $2$. Can ""Existence of a set that is Lebesgue measurable but non-Borel"" be proved without choice? I saw the standard example (Luzin's example using continued fraction), but i'm not sure what Lebesgue measurable set stated there. Moreover, if it is not true in ZF, what about ""Existence of a set that is Codable-Lebesgue Measurable but non-Borel""? $3$. (This is closely related to 1) Why Lebesgue measure is unique? Assuming Axiom of Choice, it is a theorem, that ""If $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are translation-invariant measures on sigma algebras $\mathfrak{M}_1$ and $\mathfrak{M}_2$ repectively, containing all Borel sets, and $\mu_1(K), \mu_2(K) <\infty$ for every compact set $K$, then there exists a constant $c$ such that $\mu_1(E)=c\mu_2(E)$ for all the borel sets $E$"".

H is a subgroup of prime order, so it is cyclic and hence abelian. This means $H \leq C_G(H)$. By Lagrange's theorem, $C_G(H)$ (applied to $H \leq C_G(H)$ and $ C_G(H) \leq G$), this means $C_G(H)$ is either of order 7 or 203. I am not sure how to eliminate one of the cases. If I assume it is of order 203, and hence equal to $G$, immediately means that $H \leq Z(G)$, as it commutes with all the elements of G. Using Lagrange's theorem again on $Z(G)$, you can say that $Z(G)$is either $H$ or $G$. If it is $H$, then $|G/Z(G)|$ equals 29, which implies that it is cylic, and hence G is abelian, which is a contradicts $Z(G)=H$ as $Z(G)=G$. Hence $Z(G)=G$. So coming to the point, I want to know why $C_G(H) \ne 7$

Computing the group operations in $H$ should not require knowledge of $p$ directly, merely the ability to work in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. $H$ is an abelian group whose order is close to $p$, or not too much larger than $P$. $H$ is elementary and can be described relatively simply.  (It should not need fancy machinery or a huge buildup.) Here $p$ is a prime. Maybe this is easier to explain with a few examples: $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ satisfies all these requirements.  Obviously, you can compute group operations directly.  Its order is $p-1$, and it is simple to explain. An elliptic curve $H=\mathbb{E}(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ defined by some equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ (all modulo $p$) is another example.  Each element of $H$ can be represented as a pair of elements of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.  The group law can be computed using a few operations on $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.  The group order is a number near $p$. Unfortunately, this is not elementary: it requires a bunch of setup to learn about elliptic curves. I think there might be another group $H$ based upon Lucas sequences, defined by $V_0=2$, $V_1=A$, $V_j=AV_{j-1} - V{j-2}$ (all taken modulo $p$) and where $A$ is chosen so that the Jacobi symbol $(A^2-4/p)$ is $-1$.  An element of $H$ is a value in the Lucas sequence.  We have the relation $V_{2n} = V_n^2 - 2$, so then I think it might be possible to define the group operation of $H$ so that $h^2$ can be computed from $h$ in the way that $V_{2n}$ can be computed from $V_n$ (the one thing I don't know is how to define the multiplication operation).  I have a suspicion this might lead to a group of order $p+1$, but I'm not sure.  This is not super-elementary, though, and I'm not sure whether it is possible to fill in the details to make this work -- maybe you can fix this idea up. Does anyone know of any other examples for sister groups $H$? (Preferably ones where the group order is something other than $p-1$, as I already know an examples for that.) [Motivation: each group $H$ has a chance of leading to a factoring method.  For instance, the first example leads to the $p-1$ factoring algorithm, while the second example leads to the elliptic curve (ECM) factoring algorithm.  I was hoping to find some simpler, more elementary examples than elliptic curves as a way of introducing the conceptual idea behind the ECM factoring algorithm, without requiring to explain all of the machinery behind the theory of elliptic curves.

I don't have much problem with their formulae and working rules, but I want to look at them in a little more geometric way. For example, the geometric significance of gradient that I got out of my book is the following: if $f:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function then $\nabla f (x,y,z)$ is the vector perpendicular to the level surface $f(x,y,z)=c$ ($c$ constant) at the point $(x,y,z)$.

286896,Is the closure of connected set path connected?,"If $U$ is a connected open set in $\mathbb R^n$, is $\bar U$ path-connected? (that is, for any two points $x_1,x_2$ in the closure of $U$, can we find a continuous path connecting them?)",['general-topology']
286898,Mean value inequality and Fixed-point theorem,"I need help to understand this question, it's not that clear for me: Using the norm $|x|+|y|$ and the Mean value inequality, give a condition over the partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ for the Fixed point theorem may be applied to the transformation: $$T(x,y)=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$$ I'm not sure what exactly I should do, how to start with this one.
Thanks a lot!","['multivariable-calculus', 'analysis']"
286899,Probability a rotation has a small distance to a vector,"Given two binary vectors $V_1$, $V_2$ of length $\ell$, say that the distance between $V_1$ and $V_2$ is the number of positions in the vectors that don't match. So the distance between $001$ and $101$ is $1$.  We also define rotations of $V$ so that if $V$ is $01011$, for example, the five rotations are $01011$, $10110$, $01101$, $110101$ and $10101$. We can therefore index the rotations from $0$ to $\ell-1$ so that index $i$ refers to rotation $i$ and index $0$ refers to the identity rotation. If the vector is chosen uniformly at random and we are given an index $i$, how can I compute the probability that $V$ has distance at most $k$ to rotation $i$?","['probability', 'combinatorics']"
