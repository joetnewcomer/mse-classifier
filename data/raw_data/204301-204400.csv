4045530,"prove that if $f$ is decreasing and bijective, then $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are strictly decreasing.","I have done the first part proving f is strictly decreasing, but it is so confusing to prove the inverse function is also strictly decreasing. This is what I have so far, I am not sure if it's correct or not because of so many inequality signs. Here's my proof. Let $A, B$ the domain and codomain of f. We need to prove that for any $x, y \in A$ and $u,v \in B$ , if $x < y$ and $u < v$ , we have $f(x) >  f(y)$ and $f^{-1}(u) > f^{-1}(v)$ . Assume $x < y$ . Since f is decreasing, we have $f(x) \ge f(y)$ . Since $x \neq y$ and f is bijective, $f(x) \neq f(y)$ , we must have $f(x) > f(y)$ . Next, we need to prove that $f^{-1}$ is strictly decreasing, so assume $u < v$ . set $a = f^{-1}(u)$ and $b = f^{-1}(v)$ , so we claim that $a > b$ . If not, then $a \ge b$ . Since f is decreasing, we have $u = f(a) \ge f(b) = v$ . This is a contradiction since by our choice, $u < v$ . Hence $f^{-1}$ is decreasing. I am not sure about the part which is $u = f(a) \ge f(b) = v$ is right or not. Because we have $a > b$ , $f^{-1}(u) \ge f^{-1}(v)$ which is $a>b$ . Then, we take inverse on both side which becomes to $u \ge v$ . Am I understanding the definition of decreasing function right?","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"
4045532,Torsion-free Lie groups,"Out of curiosity, I'm looking for some examples of Lie groups that are torsion-free. For some reason (and perhaps there is a good reason), most torsion-free groups I've heard of are discrete. One Lie example that comes to mind is $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Also, if $G$ is a Lie group and its torsion subgroup, call it $\Gamma$ , is both normal and discrete, then $G/\Gamma$ provides another source of examples.

4045631,Intersection of subgroups of a finite abelian group,"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and let $g \in G$ be a non-trivial element. I want to show that the intersection over all subgroups $G'$ of $G$ such that $G/G'$ is cyclic  and $g \not \in G'$ is trivial. My attempt: By the Fundamental theorem of abelian groups, $G \cong \mathbb Z/n_1 \mathbb Z \times \cdots \times  \mathbb Z/n_m \mathbb Z$ . We prove by induction on the number of cyclic factors of $G$ . For the base case ( $m=1$ ), $G$ is cyclic. Then if we let $G'=\{e\}$ , $G/G'$ is cyclic and $g \not \in G'$ . Thus, the proposition is true in this case. Now for the general case, write $G = \mathbb Z/n_1 \mathbb Z \times \cdots \times  \mathbb Z/n_m \mathbb Z$ as before and let $g=(g_1, \ldots, g_m)$ . Since $g$ is non-trivial, at least of its components is not zero. WLOG, assume $g_1 \neq 0$ . Then $h:=(g_1, \ldots, g_{m-1})$ is a non-zero element of $H:=\mathbb Z/n_1 \mathbb Z \times \cdots \times  \mathbb Z/n_{m-1} \mathbb Z$ . By the inudction hypothesis, the intersection over all subgroups $H'$ of $H$ such that $H/H'$ is cyclic  and $h \not \in H'$ is trivial. I am not sure how to proceed from here and I will be very grateful for any advice on this attempt or some ideas for an alternative attempt.","['cyclic-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

4045654,Exercise 8.5.13 Terence Tao's Analysis 1,"Background I am trying to prove a lemma in Terence Tao's Analysis 1 which is used to prove the statement below. Let $X$ be a partially ordered set with ordering relation $\leq$ , and let $x_0$ be an element of $X$ . Then there is a well-ordered subset $Y$ of $X$ which has $x_0$ as its minimal element, and which has no strict upper bound. My Understanding The following definitions are relevant: Let $X$ be a partially ordered set with ordering relation $\leq$ , and let $Y$ be a subset of X. If $x \in X$ , we say that $x$ is an upper bound for $Y$ iff $y \leq x$ for all $y \in Y$ . If in addition $x \notin Y$ then we say $x$ is a strict upper bound of $Y$ . Tao assumes to the contrary that the statement above is false. Then every well-ordered subset $Y$ of $X$ which has $x_0$ as its minimal element has at least one strict upper bound. Appealing to the Axiom of Choice we can assign to each such subset $Y$ a strict upper bound $s(Y) \in X$ . He then makes the following definition. A subset $Y$ of $X$ is said to be good set if $Y$ is well-ordered, contains $x_0$ as its minimal element and obeys the property that $x = s(\{y \in Y: y < x\})$ for each $x \in Y$ where $x \neq x_0$ . The lemma set as Exercise 8.5.13 and the one i'm trying to prove is If $Y$ and $Y'$ are two good subsets of $X$ , then every element of $Y'\setminus Y$ is a strict upper bound for $Y$ , and every element of $Y \setminus Y'$ is a strict upper bound for $Y'$ I got stuck for some time so I peeked at the hint in the textbook which was roughly show that $s(Y \cap Y ')$ exists and that $Y \cap Y'$ is good. Then show that $s(Y \cap Y') = \min(Y \setminus Y')$ if $Y \setminus Y'$ is non-empty and simlarly when $Y$ and $Y'$ are interchanged. I have managed to show $s(Y \cap Y ')$ exists and that $Y \cap Y'$ is good but I am terribly stuck with regards to the last part of the hint. If one can point me in the right direction or give me a hint that would be extremely helpful and appreciated. Note: I have already looked at the following relevant question Exercise 8.5.13 Tao Analysis 1 but the accepted answer uses Zorn's Lemma which unfortunately is not satisfactory since my lemma is used to prove the statment I mentioned at the start of the question. And this statement is used to prove Zorn's Lemma which is Exercise 8.5.14","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification']"

4045836,Dividing a disk of diameter 1 into pieces of smaller diameter,"Let $F$ be an arbitrary bounded set on the plane, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let's define $d_n(F)$ as the minimum diameter one can ensure when cutting a set $F$ into $n$ pieces. So, here is a discussion of the value $d_n(F)$ for an arbitrary set of diameter 1. I decided to consider $d_n$ for a circle of unit diameter D.
It is quite simple to understand the values of $d_n(D)$ for $n \leqslant 7$ and they are calculated in [SCY, page 96-98]( Geometrical estimations and combinatorial geometry problems ): $d_1(D) = d_2(D) = 1, d_3(D)= \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}, d_4(D) = \frac{ \sqrt 2}{2}, d_5(D) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{5})$ , and $d_6(D) = d_7(D) = \frac{1}{2}$ . I also can prove that $d_8 (D) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{7})$ , this is also not difficult (there will be 1 set to cover the center and 7 to cover the border of disk) But for $d_{9}(D)$ I don't know precise value. I know that $0.3826... = \sin(\frac{\pi}{8}) \leqslant d_9(D) \leqslant \frac{\sqrt{7} - 1}{3\sqrt{2}} = 0.3879...$ . The lower estimate is correct, because otherwise, for $x < \sin(\frac{\pi}{8})$ , there are not enough 8 sets to cover the boundary of the disk,  so the set that covers the center will have a diameter of at least $0.5$ . The upper bound is correct from this picture : The dashed lines indicate the segments where the diameter is reached. I think that this partition is optimal, but I don't yet understand how to prove it strictly. Does anyone have any ideas?","['dissection', 'euclidean-geometry', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry']"

4046307,Can similar convex heptagons tile the plane?,"It is a fairly straightforward matter to apply Euler's formula $V-E+F=2$ for planar graphs to see that congruent convex heptagons cannot tile the plane. The graph associated to the heptagons within distance $R$ of the origin, with edges between heptagons that overlap along an edge, has degree $\ge7$ at every ""interior"" vertex but (for sufficiently large $R$ ) insufficiently many exterior vertices to balance things out. This can be extended to any family of convex heptagons whose area and perimeter are bounded - see e.g. this thread on the /r/mathriddles subreddit for a more detailed proof. I am curious whether it is possible to tile the plane with convex heptagons which are similar to each other; I suspect it is impossible, but the above sort of argument seems to fail, because we cannot assume boundedness. Note that there do exist tilings of the plane by heptagons if we relax these boundedness constraints; for instance, one can take a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by heptagons in the disc model and apply a map $(r,\theta)\mapsto(\frac{r}{1-r},\theta)$ to yield a tiling of the whole plane (if we straighten out the edges after applying the transformation). Is it possible to tile the plane with similar convex heptagons? If the answer is ""no"", I am interested in the case of finitely many heptagon shapes, which I suspect is also impossible. Edit: Edward H.'s answer made me realize that there are some additional tiling conditions that seem relevant when allowing for arbitrarily-scaled pieces. Say that a tiling is lower-bounded if there is some $\epsilon>0$ such that every tile contains a ball of radius $\epsilon$ . Say that a tiling is locally finite if the boundary of every tile is covered by finitely many other tiles. Say that a tiling is traversable if you can reach any tile from any other tile by crossing over shared edges. Say that a tiling is complete if every point in the plane is in the closure of a tile (as opposed to being in the closure of the union of all tiles). I'm most interested in the case of tilings that are locally finite, traversable, and complete, but I'm also curious to hear about possibility/impossibility results for any of the above restrictions. (I'm also interested in any implications between them - I think that being lower-bounded implies the other three conditions, but I don't have a proof yet.)","['graph-theory', 'convex-geometry', 'geometry', 'polygons', 'tiling']"

4046340,"In the proof of Morse's Lemma, why can it happen that $h_{ij} \neq h_{ji}$?","The following is the first step in the proof of Morse's Lemma: Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\overline x$ is the origin in $\mathbb R^N$ (in the sense that the chart takes $\overline x$ to the origin) and that $f(\overline x) = f(0) = 0$ (trivial).
Note that we can write, for $x$ in a neighborhood of the origin, \begin{align*}
f(x) 
& = \int_0^1 \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (tx) x_i \ dt \\

4046356,An identity related to the second-order Eulerian numbers.,"Recently, some of the remarkable properties of second-order
Eulerian numbers $ \left\langle\!\!\left\langle n\atop k\right\rangle\!\!\right\rangle$ A340556 have been proved on MSE [ a , b , c ]. But there are also other notable identities to which these numbers lead.
For instance, we also noticed the following identity, which we haven't seen
elsewhere (reference?): $$ \sum_{j=0}^{k} \binom{n-j}{n-k} 
\left\langle\!\! \left\langle n\atop  j\right\rangle\!\! \right\rangle \,=\, 
\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{j+k} \binom{n+k}{n+j} \left\{ n+j \atop  j\right \} \quad ( n \ge 0) $$ If we use the notation $ \operatorname{W}_{n, k} $ for these numbers,
we can also introduce the corresponding polynomials. $$ \operatorname{W}_{n}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \operatorname{W}_{n, k} x^k \quad ( n \ge 0) $$ So far so routine, but then came the surprise: $$ 3^n W_n\left(-\frac13\right) \, = \, 2^n \left\langle\!\!\left\langle - \frac{1}{2} \right\rangle\!\!\right\rangle_n  \quad ( n \ge 0) $$ On the right side are the numbers we recently asked about their combinatorial significance !

4046526,Does every vector bundle have a 'tensor inverse'?,"For any vector bundle $E$ over a finite-dimensional CW complex, there is a vector bundle $E'$ such that $E\oplus E'$ is trivial. For a compact Hausdorff base, this is Proposition 1.4 of Hatcher's Vector Bundles and K Theory , while the general case can be deduced from Tom Goodwillie's comments here . Finite-dimensionality of the base is a necessary hypothesis as the tautological line bundle $\gamma^1 \to \mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ demonstrates (see Example 3.6 of Hatcher). While these references only deal with real vector bundles, the analogous statements are true for complex vector bundles too (the arguments carry over easily). My question is whether there is an analogue of the above result when direct sum is replaced by tensor product. Question: Let $E$ be a vector bundle over a finite-dimensional CW complex. Is there a vector bundle $E'' \neq 0$ such that $E\otimes E''$ is trivial? One case where such a bundle exists is when $E$ is a line bundle: we can take $E'' = E^*$ as $E\otimes E^* \cong \operatorname{End}(E)$ which is a rank one bundle with a nowhere-zero section, namely $\operatorname{id}_E$ . Stiefel-Whitney classes do not provide any obstructions to the existence of such a bundle. More precisely, for any bundle $E$ over a CW complex of dimension $d$ , there is a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ such that $w(E\otimes E'') = 1$ . To see this, first choose an integer $j$ such that $2^j > d$ . Now note that \begin{align*}
w(E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}) &= w(E^{\oplus 2^j})\\ 
&= w(E)^{2^j}\\ 
&= (1 + w_1(E) + \dots + w_d(E))^{2^j}\\ 
&= 1 + w_1(E)^{2^j} + \dots + w_d(E)^{2^j}\\ 
&= 1
\end{align*} as $\deg w_i(E)^{2^j} = i2^j > d$ for $i > 0$ . Although one can compute Pontryagin classes of tensor products, see here , I haven't been able to establish the existence of a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ with $p(E\otimes E'') = 1$ (or even just $p_1(E\otimes E'') = 0$ ). You can use Pontryagin classes to show that $E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}$ can be non-trivial, i.e. the above trick to kill Stiefel-Whitney classes won't necessarily give rise to a trivial bundle. For example, if $E = T\mathbb{CP}^2$ , the bundle $E\otimes\varepsilon^{2^j}$ is non-trivial for all $j \geq 0$ as $p_1(E^{\oplus 2^j}) = 2^jp_1(E) = 2^jp_1(T\mathbb{CP}^2) \neq 0$ . One thing which makes the direct sum analogue easier to attack is the fact that the existence of a bundle $E'$ with $E\oplus E'$ trivial is equivalent to $E$ being a subbundle of a trivial bundle. I am not aware of a condition on $E$ that is equivalent to the existence of a bundle $E'' \neq 0$ with $E\otimes E''$ trivial. I was hoping that the existence of such a bundle could be interpreted in terms of K theory, but I don't think this is possible as the triviality of $E\otimes E''$ doesn't imply the triviality of $(E\oplus\varepsilon^k)\otimes E''$ .","['k-theory', 'vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'characteristic-classes']"

Since $B_0(x, \epsilon) \cap (D \cup E)^c \neq \emptyset$ , the sets $B_0(x, \epsilon)$ , $D^c$ and $E^c$ have a non-empty intersection. So $x \notin (D \cup E)^c$ and then $x \in D \land x \in E$ .

4046988,Finitely generated group with subexponential growth and surjection onto $\mathbb{Z}$ has finitely generated kernel.,"I am trying to solve exercise 6.E.20 from the book of Clara Löh on Geometric Group Theory. Let $G$ be a finitely
generated group with subexponential growth that admits a surjective homomorphism $\pi:G\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ .  Show that then the kernel of $\pi$ is also finitely
generated. I am still missing the part where you use the fact that $G$ has subexponential growth. Take $T$ a finite generating set of $G$ and take $g\in G$ such that $\pi(g)= 1$ . For any $t\in T$ , if $\pi(t)=n$ , we can write $t=tg^{-n}\cdot g^n$ . Since $\pi(tg^{-n})=0$ , we can find finite $S\subset\operatorname{ker}\pi$ such that $S\cup \{g\}$ generates $G$ . Now take $x=t_1t_2\ldots t_k\in\operatorname{ker}\pi$ with $t_i\in T$ . This can be rewritten as $$x= {t_1g^{-n_1}}g^{n_1}{t_2g^{-n_2}}g^{-n_1}g^{n_1+n_2}{t_3g^{-n_3}}g^{-n_1-n_2}\cdots

        g^{n_1+\cdots+n_{k-1}}{t_kg^{-n_k}}g^{-n_1-\cdots -n_{k-1}}$$ Here, $n_i = \pi(t_i)$ and the final factor vanishes since $n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k=0$ because $x\in\operatorname{ker}\pi$ . We have shown that every element in the kernel is generated by the set $\{g^nsg^{-n}\mid s\in S\}$ . Now Löh claims that this $n$ must be bounded and hence that the kernel is finitely generated.
I feel like this is a consequence of the subexponential growth but I cannot make this rigorous. Subexponential growth means that for a generating set $T$ , the growth function does not quasi-dominate an exponential.

Show that $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$ . I would like to know if my proof holds, please. My attempt is to pass by primitive of $f$ . First of all, as $f\in C([a,b])$ , $f$ has a primitive $F\in C^1([a,b])$ such that $F'(x)=f(x) \ \forall x \in [a,b]$ . Then, as $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\phi'(x) \ dx=0$ holds for all continuous and differentiable functions $\phi$ on $[a,b]$ , we can choose $\phi=F$ . So we have to show that $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)F'(x) \ dx=\int_{a}^{b}f^2(x)=0 \implies f$ constant. Let $G$ be a primitive of $f^2$ . We have that $G'(x)=f^2(x)\ge 0 \ \forall x \in [a,b]$ . So, $G$ is increasing on $[a,b]$ . Moreover, $G(b)-G(a)=0 \iff G(a)=G(b)$ . So, we conclude that $G$ is constant as $a\le x\le b\iff G(a)\le G(x)\le G(b)=G(a)$ . Thus, $G'=f^2=0 \Rightarrow f=0$ .

4047110,Probability St Petersburg Game,"I am reading a book on probability and there is an interesting chapter on the St Petersburg game - where a coin is flipped until a head is landed and the prize is £2 if there is a head on the first throw, £4 is there is a head on the second flip, £8 for a head on the third etc. The idea of this game is it introduces a paradox since someone should be prepared to pay any amount to play since the expected yield is infinite. However in the book it introduces the notion of changing the rewards to 2,4,6,8.... etc rather than the doubling in the original game. The book contends that even though the possible payouts increase without bound the calculation of the expected value yields a sensible answer of £4. It mentions that this is simple to calculate so omits the calculations. I have pondering this and cant see how the £4 has been arrived at - a entry price of £4 would be a fair price for the game but why? Any help greatly appreciated.

4047299,Probability: Rotating circular board,"Let there be a circular board that is divided into $2^k$ sectors (similar to a dartboard). Each sector can be red with probability $p$ and green with probability $1- p$ . If we rotate the board, when it comes to rest, I am interested in an event that a red sector covers the 6 o'clock direction. Now let $X$ denote the reward that one gets when the above event occurs. The random variable $X$ takes a value according to the following rule: $X = 1/t$ , when $1 \leq t\leq 2^k$ sectors are red and one of them covers the 6 o'clock direction, i.e., the reward of $1$ is shared among those red sectors. I am interested in the probability mass function of $X$ . When none of the sectors that are red covers the 6 o'clock direction, the reward is $0$ , i.e., $X = 0$ . My attempt : There are $2^k + 1$ combinations depending on how many of the $2^k$ sectors are red, e.g., $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $\dotsc$ , $2^k$ . Let $p_n$ denote the probability that $n$ sectors are red before rotating the board. Then we have $$p_n = {2^k \choose n}p^{n}(1-p)^{2^k-n}, \,\,\,\, 1 \leq n \leq 2^k.$$ Now, for the case when there are $1 \leq t \leq 2^k$ sectors are red, the probability that a red sector covers the 6 o'clock direction is $$q_t = \frac{t}{2^k}.$$ So, one has $$
X =
\begin{cases}
1, \quad \text{w.p.}~~ p_1q_1 \\
\frac{1}{2}, \quad \text{w.p.}~~ p_2q_2\\
\vdots \\
\frac{1}{2^k}, \quad \text{w.p.}~~ p_{2^k}q_{2^k} \\
0, \quad \text{w.p.}~~(1-p)^{2^k}.
\end{cases}
$$ Then the probability that a red sector covers the 6 o'clock direction is $$P_{c} = \sum_{n = 1}^{2^k} p_n q_n.$$ The probability that no red sector covers the 6 o'clock direction is $$P_{n,c} = (1-p)^{2^k}.$$ Then the following equation should hold: $$P_{c} + P_{n,c} = 1.$$ But it does not hold true. To check this, let us consider the case of $k = 1$ . In this case, $$P_{c} = \frac{1}{2}2p(1-p) + \frac{2}{2}p^2$$ and $$P_{n,c} = (1-p)^2.$$ Here, $P_c + P_{n,c} \neq 1$ .

4047689,Using a Partial Differential Equation to find the dynamics model of physical intearctions,"I don't know a lot about Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) but I think they are used to find solutions to complex interaction problems. So my first question does solving a PDE enable us to obtain the forward dynamics model of physics that describes such complex interactions, at least in theory? If so, can one then use the obtained forward dynamics model and change its parameters to generate a new fluid simulation scenes? The reason that I'm asking this is because I have some videos of various liquids interacting with one another and my goal is to find a solution that governs such interactions. The way I'm currently thinking about it is that I first need to somehow obtain a PDE from this video. Then I plug this PDE into a numerical PDE solver. Assuming that the PDE solver is general and accurate enough it should give me the correct governing equation (i.e. forward dynamics model). However, I'm not sure if my intuition on how I can find that governing equation/method is correct in the first place. In other words, I'm not sure if the steps I explained ( video -> PDE -> PDE Solver -> forward dynamics model ) are correct. If obtaining a PDE is the first step, how can I obtain a PDE from fluid simulation videos? In other words, what are the general steps that one should take in order to get the corresponding PDE? Also, given that I am working with some videos, how would the corresponding PDE look like? For instance, would the PDE be a huge matrix/tensor with dimensions corresponding to changes of each element in my scene w.r.t each other over time t ?

4048137,What is the relationship between two different Kodaira embeddings?,"Kodaira embedding theorem says: suppose $M$ is a Kähler manifold with a positive line bundle $L$ , then there exists a sufficiently large number $m$ such that basis of $H^0(M,L^{\otimes m})$ give embedding of $M$ into some projective space $\mathbb{CP}^N$ , which we denote by $\phi_m: M \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^N$ . Now I want to propose the following question: suppose $m_1,m_2$ are sufficiently large such that $L^{\otimes m_1}, L^{\otimes m_2}$ are both very ample, then what can we say about the relationship between two Kodaira embedding $\phi_{m_1}, \phi_{m_2}$ ? Maybe above question is too general and seems less approachable. Let me change to ask the following question, which will be enough for my usage: suppose $m_2=d \cdot m_1$ where $d$ is an integer.  Can we prove $\phi_{m_1}, \phi_{m_2}$ are connected via d-uple embedding? Recall d-uple embedding is given by:  let $N_2 = \binom{N_1+d}{d}-1$ , then d-uple embedding is $\iota: \mathbb{CP}^{N_1}\rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^{N_2}, [z_0:z_1:\cdots:z_{N_1}] \mapsto [z_0^d: z_0^{d-1}z_1:\cdots:z_n^{d}]$ , is $\phi_{m_2}= \iota \circ \phi_{m_1}$ correct? Thank you in advance. Edit: Thanks to Ted's advise in comment, I try to start from simple example to get some ideas. Let $M=\mathbb{CP}^n$ with hyperplane bundle $L=\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{CP^n}}(m)$ where $m>0$ . Note global section $H^0(\mathbb{CP}^n, \mathcal{O}(m))$ is generated by homogeneous polynomials with degree $k$ , then $\text{dim}_{\mathbb{C}} H^0(\mathbb{CP}^n, \mathcal{O}(m))=\binom{n+m}{n}$ . In the above setting, Kodaira embedding is exactly given by k-uple embedding: $\phi: \mathbb{CP}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^{\binom{n+m}{n}-1}, [z_0:z_1:\cdots:z_{n}] \mapsto [z_0^m: z_0^{m-1}z_1:\cdots:z_n^{m}]$ . Now, if $m_2 = d \cdot m_1$ , then $\phi_{m_2}= \iota \circ \phi_{m_1}$ , where $\iota$ is d-uple embedding.

I suspect the answer is yes, but I don't know how to deal with the case where two distinct eigenvalues of $A$ have the same modulus. Edit: The comments encouraged me to add more details. Let $J$ be the Jordan form of $A$ and $P$ such that $A=PJP^{-1}$ . Then $$A^n =
P\begin{pmatrix}
J_1^n & \;     & \; \\
\;  & \ddots & \; \\ 
\;  & \;     & J_m^n
\end{pmatrix}P^{-1} $$ where $J_i$ is a Jordan block of size $k_i\times k_i$ , so that $$ J_i^n = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda_i^n & \binom{n}{1}\lambda_i^{n-1} & \binom{n}{2}\lambda_i^{n-2} & \cdots & \cdots & \binom{n}{k_i-1}\lambda_i^{n-k_i+1} \\
 & \lambda_i^n & \binom{n}{1}\lambda_i^{n-1} & \cdots & \cdots & \binom{n}{k_i-2}\lambda_i^{n-k_i+2} \\
 &  & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
 &  & & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
 &  & &  & \lambda_i^n & \binom{n}{1}\lambda_i^{n-1}\\
 &  &  &  &  & \lambda_i^n
\end{pmatrix}. $$ Thus every entry of $A^n v$ has the form $$\tag{1}\label{sum}\sum_{i=1}^m p_i(n)\lambda_i^n$$ where $p_i$ is a complex polynomial such that $\deg p_i< k_i$ for $i=1,\dots,m$ . So essentially what I'm asking is this: Suppose $|\lambda_i|\ge1$ for $i=1,\dots,m$ and that \eqref{sum} converges to $0$ (when $n\to\infty$ ). Does it imply that the sequence \eqref{sum} is identically zero?","['matrices', 'convergence-divergence', 'linear-algebra']"
4048925,Does this discrete curve have a name?,"Generated using the following logic. Begin at a center starting point and draw two one-unit line segments from the center point in opposite directions. Draw two one-unit line segments that begin at the end of each of the previous step's endpoint, perpendicular to the previous segment and opposite one another. Continue doing this while a given path does not terminate. A path terminates if both new segments would touch another path from this or a previous step. Here is a visual of the first few generations, center point and terminal points marked.","['curves', 'discrete-geometry', 'geometry', 'terminology']"

4048954,Probability of A and not B,"I'm studying Introduction to probability and currently, I'm stuck with the following problem. Given: $P(A)=0.7$ , $P(B)=0.5$ , $P(A\cap B)=0.45$ What is the probability of A and not B? I've checked this similar question but I don't understand the answers. Also I've asked my instructor and she told me that $1-P(A\cap B)(P(B^c))$ is the answer (As the answers suggested, this result is not correct) . Why is that? She does not provided me a completely explanation. Update 1: The original problem is the following In a multiplex cinema, there are two different rooms, $A$ and $B$ , working simultaneously. Let $SA$ be the event that, during a certain showing, room $A$ becomes full before the film begins, and let $SB$ be the event that, during the same showing, room $B$ becomes full before the beginning of the movie. We know that $P(SA)=0.7$ ; $P(SB)=0.5$ and $P(SA∩SB)=0.45$ Calculate the probability that room $A$ will become full and room $B$ will not. Did I state the problem correctly? Update 2: Add a Venn diagram . Following the advice of Ethan Bolker. Here is the Venn diagram that I made.",['probability']

If $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ are sequences of nonnegative integers and $(\Sigma_n a_n x^n)(\Sigma_n b_n x^n) = \Sigma_n c_n x^n$ , then $(c_n)$ is always a sequence of nonnegative integers.

4049168,What is $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\mathbb{R}^n$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why is $\mathbb{R}^2$ not a subset and /or a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$? (2 answers) Are the reals $\mathbb{R}$ a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$? (2 answers) Are the reals genuinely a subset of the complex numbers? [duplicate] (8 answers) Closed 3 years ago . In C.H. Edwards's Advanced Calculus of Several Variables he defines the ordinate set $\mathcal{O}_f$ of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ as the set of points between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the graph of $f,$ including the points of evaluation, $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and the points in the graph $\left\{\mathbf{x},f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\right\}\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ .  Later on he defines a set $\hat{\mathcal{G}}=\partial\mathcal{O}_f-\mathbb{R}^n,$ where $\partial\mathcal{O}_f$ is the boundary of $\mathcal{O}_f.$ The intent seems clear.  First $$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\mathbb{R}^n=\mathbb{R}^n\times\left(\mathbb{R}-\left\{0\right\}\right)$$ where $\times$ means Cartesian product.  Then $$\hat{\mathcal{G}}=\left(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\mathbb{R}^n\right)\cap\partial\mathcal{O}_f.$$ But long ago I learned that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all real number n-tuples, and $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the set of all (n+1)-tuples, so elements of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are not elements of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is not a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}.$ So am I correct in concluding that $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-\mathbb{R}^n$ is not really the relative complement of the two sets?","['elementary-set-theory', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-spaces']"
