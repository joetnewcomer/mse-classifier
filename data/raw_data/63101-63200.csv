721543,How do I study Stein & Shakarchi's Complex Analysis,"I'm currently self-studying some complex analysis. My background is limited: single- and multivariable calculus, linear algebra, introductory Fourier analysis and matrix theory. Each course, with multivariable calculus being a bit of an exception, has emphasized theory and proofs. I've also done the first four chapters of ""Baby Rudin"" in my spare time. The complex analysis book by Stein and Shakarchi is interesting. At times, the book omits quite a few steps that are not so obvious to me. I'm not unfamiliar with this from Rudin who I found was very clear despite the rather terse style. This book will sometimes omit more than I would like. For example, on pages 42-45 the book gives two examples of how real integrals can be solved using Cauchy's theorem, and I had to do a significant amount of filling in the steps and this made me kind of lose track of the bigger idea. I don't like being spoon-fed things because I like to think but at times filling in the steps too much gets in the way of the learning. At least this is how I experience it. My gripe with the book, however, is with the exercises. Many of the exercises, I find, are very difficult. With Rudin, I struggled because the material was abstract: working so rigorously in general metric spaces was extremely challenging for me but I still managed to do at least half the exercises in each chapter. I can at best a third of the exercises in S&S. Any advice on how to better absorb the material in this book? It seems to have a pretty interesting approach with many interesting topics (Zeta function, prime number theorem, Riemann mapping theorem, elliptic functions) including some that appear early (Runge's theorem, Hadamard's factorization theorem). So there's plenty of wonderful mathematics here but the exercises are making studying this terribly difficult.","['self-learning', 'complex-analysis']"

721553,Visualizing mathematics and geometry,"Im writing a paper on the role of visualization in mathematics and specifically geometry.  I was wondering if it is possible to represent any arbitrary system of relations and manipulable objects visually, and how this interpretation imbues a meaning to the mathematical structures.  At this point I am simply trying to gather the opinions and musings of fellow mathematicians and logicians on this topic to see which ideas are the most interesting and worth writing about.  I am particularly interested in the extreme cases of things which are very difficult to interpret visually, as well as the things which are best interpreted visually(fractals and impossible figures).  Let me know what you guys think about this topic, Im sure this community has a wealth of interesting ideas.
Thanks! looking forward to hearing your thoughts
EDIT:
I realize my question is unclear, but Im not looking for an answer per se but more of some general thoughts on the subject.  For example, when you say that there are far more mathematical objects which cannot be easily visualized, what aspects or properties make visualization difficult or impossible?  Im interested in discussing the nature of visualization and its role in mathematics.  Is visualization simply a tool to help us intuitively understand the more abstract concepts and relations?  Or is visualization a process deeply connected to mathematics itself?  If so is this due to our human intuition imbuing its own structural artifacts into algebra and logic? I realize I am not asking a specific question, so answering in a concrete way is difficult, but as I said I am more interested in discussion and related examples of interesting phenomena.","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'philosophy', 'visualization']"
721574,Understanding why nonsingular complex algebraic varieties are analytic manifolds.,"I am trying to understand why every (quasi-projective) nonsingular complex algebraic variety is an analytic manifold. Consider a nonsingular affine algebraic variety $X\subset \mathbb{C}^n$ of dimension $n-k$.  The idea, I think, is to write it as the level set of some holomorphic submersion.  If $X$ is a complete intersection, i.e. the ideal $I(X) \subset \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is generated by $k$ polynomials $f_1,\dots,f_k$, then using nonsingularity we have that these polynomials become the components of a submersion $f:\mathbb{C}^n\to\mathbb{C}^{k}$ and hence $X$ is the level set of a submersion, so an analytic manifold of dimension $n-k$. The problem is that general nonsingular affine algebraic varieties $X$ are not complete intersections.  However there is a theorem in Hartshorne which says that they are ""locally a complete intersection"". Now I am only beginning to learn algebraic geometry and the definition of ""locally a complete intersection"" is in the language of schemes which I haven't learned yet.   In particular I don't understand what it means geometrically. Can we use the ""locally a complete intersection"" property to write $X$ as locally the level set of a submersion? TLDR: Can we use the fact that nonsingular affine algebraic varieties are ""locally a complete intersection"" to write them as locally the level set of a submersion?","['complex-manifolds', 'algebraic-geometry']"

721597,Module of Kähler differentials for a formal power series ring,"Let $A$ be a ring and $A[[T]]$ the formal power series over $A$. Then, one can show that  $\Omega^1_{A[[T]]/A}$ is not  finitely generated over $A[[t]]$. Now, in $\Omega^1_{A[[T]]/A}$ I am trying to show that the intersection $\cap_{n \geq 1} T^i \Omega^1_{A[[T]]/A} $ is non-zero in general, and that it can even be non-zero if $A$ is a field of characteristic 0. I can show that the intersection is non-zero if $A$ is not an integral domain, but if $A$ is a field of characteristic 0, then I don't see how to proceed. Any hints or solutions? Edit: Possible directions to consider might be to look at the relation $A[[t]]=A[t]+(t^n)A[[t]]$ for any $n >0$.

721608,"If $E/F$ is algebraic and every $f\in F[X]$ has a root in $E$, why is $E$ algebraically closed? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Is the sub-field of algebraic elements of a field extension of $K$ containing roots of polynomials over $K$ algebraically closed? (2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . Suppose $E/F$ is an algebraic extension, where every polynomial over $F$ has a root in $E$. It's not clear to me why $E$ is actually algebraically closed. I attempted the following, but I don't think it's correct: I let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial in $E[X]$. I let $\alpha$ be a root in some extension, so $f=m_{\alpha,E}$. Since $\alpha$ is algebraic over $E$, it is also algebraic over $F$, let $m_{\alpha,F}$ be it's minimal polynomial. I now let $K$ be a splitting field of $m_{\alpha,F}$, which is a finite extension since each root has finite degree over $F$. If $m_{\alpha,F}$ is separable, then $K/F$ is also separable, so as a finite, separable extension, we can write $K=F(\beta)$ for some primitive element $\beta$. By assumption, $m_{\alpha,F}$ has a root in $E$, call it $r$. Then we can embed $F(\beta)$ into $r$ by mapping $\beta$ to $r$. It follows that $m_{\alpha,F}$ splits in $E$. Since $f\mid m_{\alpha,F}$, we must also have the $f$ is split in $E$. But what happens if $m_{\alpha,F}$ is not separable? In such case, $F$ must have characteristic $p$. I know we can express $m_{\alpha,F}=g(X^{p^k})$ for some irreducible, separable polynomial $g(X)\in F[X]$. But I'm not sure what follows after that. NB: I say $E$ is algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial in $E[X]$ has a root in $E$.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

721645,Integer Factorization via Trigonometry,"Nearly 20 years ago, I was sitting in a physics class in high school when a ""dumb"" question occurred to me: If two pendulums with unknown (different) frequencies started oscillating at the same time and same initial phase, can't you determine their frequencies by observing how long it would take them to reach the same phase again? I then discarded the question:  Surely it had been asked and answered hundreds of years before by someone like Newton, and its answer was likely sitting in a college textbook somewhere. But some years later in college, I realized that I had asked a question that was not about physics but was, in fact, entirely about integer factorization:  If two pendulums of periods $7$ and $5$ start oscillating at time $0$, they will next meet at time $35$, time $70$, and any other time that is a product of $7$, $5$, and some other integer $k$ — and at no other times in between. So I expressed that as a simple relation, as an attempt to find $x$ in this expression: $$\sin 2 \pi x = \sin 2\pi \frac{k}{x} = 0$$ That turned out to be a particularly bad form for any meaningful study, so some months later I reformulated it as this: $$\cos (2\pi x) \cos (2\pi\frac{k}{x}) = 1$$ That this is true only when $x$ is a factor of $k$ is relatively easy to demonstrate: Given an integer $k$, The first cosine is only $1$ when $x$ is an integer; The second cosine is only $1$ when $\frac{k}{x}$ is an integer; The product is only $1$ when both cosines are $1$; And when $x$ is an integer, $\frac{k}{x}$ can only be an integer if $x$ is a factor of $k$; Therefore, the product is only $1$ when $x$ is an integer factor of $k$. In effect, the second cosine constrains the relationship between $k$ and $x$ to be ""factors"", the first cosine constrains $x$ to be integers, and the two together constrain $x$ to be integer factors of $k$. That expression has some nice properties as an alternate definition for ""integer factorization"":  It is well-defined for both positive and negative numbers, well-defined across the entire real number line, including for negative and fractional numbers, and it has an interesting hole at $0$. There are also several variations that can be constructed using sine or cosine, addition or multiplication, and various constants.  For example: $$\cos (2\pi x) + \cos (2\pi\frac{k}{x}) - 2 = 0$$ What I find most interesting about all of these expressions is that they convert the problem of factoring an integer (a discrete mathematics problem) into the domain of finding the real-valued roots of a ""simple"" expression of one variable (a continuous mathematics problem). I have attempted for years since then to see if anybody else has discovered and explored this formulation, but I've never found any references to it in literature or online.  I've also tried to see if these forms would make factoring integers any easier, using all sorts of transformations and tricks (trig identities, other periodic functions, $e^{i\pi}+1=0$), but I never successfully used it to ""solve"" any part of the integer factorization problem.  Perhaps someone else has. So to that end, the question that has been burning a hole in my brain for years is simply this: Is this expression well-known among those studying integer factorization and I've simply been reading all the wrong books and websites, or did I discover something new?","['trigonometry', 'prime-factorization']"

Assume that $N, X_1, X_2, \cdots$ are independent. Find the moment generating function for $Y$, $M_Y(s) = \displaystyle \mathbb{E}[e^{sY}]$. Working: Using the law of total expectation we have: $\displaystyle \mathbb{E}[e^{sY}] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[e^{sY}|N]]$ $\mathbb{E}[e^{sY}|N=n] = \mathbb{E}[e^{sX_1} \cdots e^{sX_N}|N=n] = \mathbb{E}[e^{sX_1} \cdots e^{sX_n}] = \mathbb{E}[e^{sX_1}]\cdots \mathbb{E}[e^{sX_n}] = [M_X(s)]^n$ where $M_X(s)$ denotes the common moment generating function of each of the $X_i$'s.

They give the following example (amongst others): What I don't understand is that how can we simply just replace $e^s$ with $M_X(s)$? Because in general, if we know the expression for, say, $\mathbb{E}[e^{sQ}]$ (for some generic random variable $Q$), then to find $\mathbb{E}[g(s)^Q]$ (for some generic function $g(s)$), we CANNOT just simply replace every instance of $e^s$ (in the expression for $\mathbb{E}[e^{sQ}]$) with $g(s)$.

721846,How can I understand the three-dimensional space forms?,"Here is what I know: A space form is defined as a manifold admitting a Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature A classical result of Cartan states that a manifold is a space form if and only if it is a quotient of $S^n$, $\mathbb{R}^n$, or $\mathbb{H}^n$ with their usual metrics by a discrete group of isometries $\Gamma$ acting properly discontinuously; furthermore $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the space form. This reduces the space form problem to a problem in group theory. Such a discrete group in the case of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{H}^n$ are referred to respectively as Kleinian or crystallographic. The sphere and the real projective space are the only even-dimensional spherical space forms. I have often seen papers in differential geometry, for example convergence results for Ricci flow [cf. Hamilton 1982 & 1986, Böhm-Wilking, Brendle-Schoen], show that manifolds admitting metrics of a certain type (e.g. of positive Ricci curvature, positive curvature operator, positive isotropic curvature) are space forms, ""which have been completely classified"" [cf. Wolf's book Spaces of constant curvature ], seeming to imply that this gives a complete understanding of such manifolds. However, even having seen such a list of groups, I don't feel that it gives me a much better understanding of space forms than what I listed above. How can I understand it better? Some sample questions: (I'm happy to restrict to the three-dimensional case for simplicity.) Are two space forms diffeomorphic if their fundamental groups are isomorphic? If this is not true, what if we require more of their homotopy groups to be isomorphic? Maybe a natural class of 3-manifolds to consider are those with locally homogeneous metrics (i.e. for any $p,q\in M$ there are neighborhoods $U_p\ni p$ and $V_q\ni q$ and an isometry $U_p\to V_q$); by a result of Singer [CPAM 1960] the universal cover of such a manifold with the pulled back metric is homogeneous and so is one of the eight geometries. If this geometry is $S^2\times\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ or $\widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(2,\mathbb{R})$ then it is immediate from the second bullet point above that $M$ is not a space form; however I think (?) Nil and Sol have the topology of $\mathbb{R}^3$; so is it possible for a locally homogeneous manifold of one of these types to be a space form? More generally, given any closed 3-manifold, are there any generally applicable (but not too trivial) necessary or sufficient conditions to see if it is a space form, perhaps on the level of homotopy, homology, or cohomology? Given any compact 3-manifold $M$, when can we make $M\sharp N$ a space form for some choice of compact 3-manifold $N$? These are just a handful of things I'm curious about.

Prove that $z=z(x,y)$ is a solution for the ode $$a\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}+b\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}=-1$$ About A: According to implicit function theorem we can require $$\Phi(x+az(x,y),y+bz(x,y))=0$$ from there I cannot find any constraints on $\Phi$ . We also require $$\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z}\neq 0$$ . but since it's function of $x+az,y+bz$ , the derivative $\Phi^\prime$ is function of $a+b$ so we require $a+b\neq0\Leftrightarrow a\neq -b$ . In these terms I think $z=z(x,y)$ is defined. I'm not sure about the first condition (seems I miss something) About B: If $z=z(x,y)$ so according to the theorem $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=\frac{\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z}}=\frac{1}{a+b},\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=\frac{\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y}}{\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z}}=\frac{1}{a+b}$$ so after substituing I get $$\frac{a+b}{a+b}=1\neq -1$$ Where am I wrong?","['multivariable-calculus', 'implicit-differentiation', 'implicit-function-theorem', 'real-analysis']"

722026,Singular Vector Fields as Basis Elements in Contact Planes.,"I'm trying to generate specific examples of contact structures in $\mathbb R^3$, but I'm running into something strange. It seems like the contact planes associated to the structure (using cylindrical coordinates in $\mathbb R^3$) EDIT/CORRECTION: My apologies to all who read this for wasting your time; the actual contact structure is, in cylindrical coordinates $( r, \theta, z)$:
$$Ker[\cos( \pi r)dz+ \sin(\pi r) d \theta], $$ ( the correction: original was:
$Ker (cos(\pi r) dr + sin (\pi r) d\theta).$ 
To be more rigorous this time, will compute $ w \wedge dw$: we have $dw=-\pi sin (\pi r)dzdr+\pi cos(\pi r)d\theta dr$. We see in expanding $w \wedge dw$ that we have two coefficients for $d\theta dz dr$ which do not cancel each other out; we actually get $\pi dzd\theta dr \neq 0$.) Still, the issue remains after the correction: Set $$(\cos( \pi r)dz+ \sin(\pi r) d \theta )(a_z \partial z+a_{\theta} \partial \theta ):=0.$$ (I got rid of the $\pi$ ) Then we get $a_z  cos( \pi r)+ a_{\theta} sin (\pi r)=0$. How do we avoid dividing here when we find a basis? We can choose, e.g., $a_{\theta}=1$ , then we have $a_z cos (\pi r)+sin(\pi r)=0 $ . And, now, solving for $a_z$ , we still have to divide , to get $a_z =-tan (\pi r )$, and a basis {$(\partial r,0,0),(0,\partial \theta, -tan(\pi r) \partial z)$} And we still have singularities whenever $\pi r= \pi/2+k \pi$ ; $k $ in $\mathbb Z$ , i.e., whenever $r=1/2+k$ How do we deal with this?","['differential-geometry', 'contact-topology']"

The problem I am having is with the proof using the formal definition: I feel like my approach is way too long-winded, can someone please confirm whether it's correct and whether there's a quicker method? Anyhow, so I did: We need to show for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n \ge N$, it follows $|\frac{n^2+n-2}{4n^2-5} - 1/4| < \epsilon$ Going backwards first: note that $|\frac{n^2+n-2}{4n^2-5} - 1/4| < \epsilon \implies|\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)}| < \epsilon$. Now pick $n$ large enough so that $\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} > 0$, hence $\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} < \epsilon \implies 0 < n^2 - \frac{1}{4\epsilon}n + \frac{3}{16\epsilon}-\frac{5}{4}$ $\implies 0 < \left[n - \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon} \right) \right]\left[n -  \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon} \right)  \right]$ so, $n > \frac{1+\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon}$ or $n < \frac{1-\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon}$. Now pick $N > \frac{1+\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon}$, then whenever $n \ge N > \frac{1+\sqrt{80\epsilon^2-12\epsilon+1}}{8\epsilon}$, we have $(8\epsilon n -1)^2 > 80\epsilon^2 - 12\epsilon + 1 \implies \epsilon > \frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} \implies |\frac{n^2+n-2}{4n^2-5} - 1/4| < \epsilon$, as required. I'm pretty sure I did the algebra right, just want to confirm whether all my arguments are correct and if there's a quicker method. EDIT: Following on from @David's post, is this solution correct?

If $n \ge 2$, then $\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} > 0$, so $|\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)}| = \frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)}$. If $n^2 > 5$ (or more conveniently assume $n \ge 3$), then $\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} < \frac{4n}{4(3n^2)} = \frac{1}{3n} < \epsilon$. Now pick $N_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $N_1 > \frac{1}{3\epsilon}$ and set $N = \max\{3, N_1\}$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ and suppose $n \ge N$, then $|\frac{n^2+n-2}{4n^2-5} - \frac{1}{4} | = |\frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)}| = \frac{4n-3}{4(4n^2-5)} < \frac{4n}{4(3n^2)} = \frac{1}{3n} < \epsilon$, as required.","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

Let $v$ be the harmonic conjugate of $u$ which vanishes at origin.Let $f=u+iv$.Then by Cauchy integral formula,$$f'(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_r}\frac{f(w)}{(w-0)^2}

722952,How do you prove ${n \choose k}$ is maximum when $k$ is $ \lceil \tfrac n2 \rceil$ or $ \lfloor \tfrac n2\rfloor $?,"How do you prove $n \choose k$ is maximum when $k$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ or $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ ? This link provides a proof of sorts but it is not satisfying. From what I understand, it focuses on product pairings present in $k! (n-k)!$ term which are of the form $i \times (i-1)$ . Since these are minimized when $i=n/2$ , we get the result. But what about the reasoning for the rest of the terms?","['optimization', 'inequality', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
722959,Domain and range of a function.,"Find the domain and range of the function $$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{[\cos x]-[\sin x]}}$$ Where [] denotes the greatest integer function. I started as $[\cos x]-[\sin x]\gt0$ $\implies \cos x\ge[\sin x]+1$ as $[y]\gt n;n\in I \implies y\ge n+1$ Also as $[\sin x]\le \sin x\lt[\sin x]+1$ $\implies \cos x\gt \sin x$ But my book gives the solution as $[\cos x]-[\sin x]\gt0$ $\implies \cos x\ge \sin x+1$ And so on... What is the error in my solution? I know that I could solve it graphically but I would prefer an algebraic solution.

722967,Prove by induction on $n$ that any set of $n$ reals is bounded,"Prove by induction on $n$ that any set of $n$ reals is bounded Working: I approached the problem by splitting it into three cases and proving each case, it seems a bit tedious to me how I did it, so I was wondering if there's a quicker method. I also want to confirm whether my arguments are valid for each case. Here goes: Base case: Consider when $n = 1$, i.e., the set $A = \{a\}$ where $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Then for $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{0\}$, $a+\epsilon$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $a-\epsilon$ is a lower bound for $A$, hence $A$ is bounded. Inductive hypothesis: Assume that any set of $k$ reals is bounded. Proof: By the inductive hypothesis, let $B = \{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k\}$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for $i = 1, 2, \cdots, k$. Then there exists some $u \in \mathbb{R}$  such that $a \le u$ for all $a \in B$ and similarly, there exists some $l \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $l \le a$ for all $a \in B$. Now assume we add one more element, $a_{k+1}$, to $B$ and form the set $C = B \cup \{a_{k+1}\}$, now consider the following three cases: 1) If $\min(B) \le a_{k+1} \le \max(b)$ then $C$ is still bounded above by $u$ and below by $l$, hence $C$ is bounded. 2) If $a_{k+1} > \max(B)$, then $a_{k+1} \le u + |a_{k+1} - \max(B)|$, then $u + |a_{k+1} - \max(B)|$ is an upper bound for $C$, while $l$ is still a lower bound for $C$, hence $C$ is bounded. 3) If $a_{k+1} < \min(B)$, then $l - |\min(B) - a_{k+1}| \le a_{k+1}$, then $|\min(B) - a_{k+1}|$ is a lower bound for $C$ while $u$ is still an upper bound for $C$, hence $C$ is bounded. Thus, we have shown that any set of $k+1$ reals is bounded, hence we are done. Are my arguments valid? Are there any quicker ways of proving this inductively? Thanks.","['induction', 'elementary-set-theory']"
722973,Represent derivation as a standard matrix (Linear mapping)?,"Given a matrix $a$ of coefficients $\left( \begin{array}{cc} a_0 \\ a_1 \\ .. \\a_n\end{array} \right)$representing $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... a_n x^n$, how can I find a standard matrix D such that $[D] a$ will give me the coefficient matrix of the derivative of $a$? So the dimensions of D will be (n+1) by (n+1). I've tried to find a D using the standard basis of $R^{n+1}$ but that would just leave me with a zero matrix as D. For example, $\left( \begin{array}{cc} 1\\ 0\\ .. \\0\end{array} \right)$ would just leave me with $\left( \begin{array}{cc} 0\\ 0\\ .. \\0\end{array} \right)$

723057,Is it generally difficult to memorize 'multivariable calculus' theorems?,"There are many weak forms of ""Fubini's theorem"" with strong hypotheses in elementary calculus texts. However, these strong hypotheses are very unnatural and are thus hard to memorize. Compared to that, the full Fubini's theorem (in measure space) is actually relatively easy to memorize in comparison. Furthermore: I am wondering if this is also the case for multivariable calculus. I'm currently studying ""implicit function theorem"", and I find the hypotheses for the theorem to be quite hard to memorize. Are theorems in mutivariable calculus easier to memorize in the context of manifolds ?","['differential-geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis']"
723117,Continuous decreasing function has a fixed point,Let $f$ be continuous and decreasing everywhere on $\mathbb{R}$. Show that: 1) $f$ has a unique fixed point 2) $f\circ f$ has either an infinite number of fixed points or an odd number of fixed points. The first part is easy and I am sure it is available on this website. The basic idea is to use the fact that a decreasing function satisfies $\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x) = A\text{ or }\infty$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = B\text{ or }-\infty$ and in each case apply the intermediate value theorem on $g(x) = f(x) - x$. The uniqueness of the fixed point is also easy to understand as $f(a) - a = 0 = f(b) - b$ would imply $b - a = f(b) - f(a)$. If $b \neq a$ then this goes against the decreasing nature of $f$. It is the second part of the problem which is bit troublesome. Let $h(x) = f(f(x))$ let $c$ be the unique fixed point of $f$ so that $f(c) = c$. This means that $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$ so that $c$ is also a fixed point of $h = f \circ f$. But counting the number of fixed points of $h$ seems tricky. Any hints are welcome!,"['calculus', 'real-analysis']"
723149,Isometry is not surjective,"According to the definition I am using, an isometry is a mapping $f:X \rightarrow Y$ between two metric spaces $(X,d_{X})$ and $(Y,d_{Y})$:
$$
d_{Y}(f(a),f(b)) = d_{X}(a,b)
$$ for all $a,b \in X $ I managed to prove that it is injective. I let $f(a)=f(b)$ so $d_{Y}(f(a),f(b))=d_{X}(a,b)=0$, which means $a=b$, by one of the axioms of distance. So $f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b$ and $f$ is injective.
Now, I have to prove (or give a counterexample) that $f$ is surjective. I thought of a very simple counterexample, but I am not sure if it is right. Consider $X,Y \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that
 $X=\left\{ (0,0),(0,1),(1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)\right\} $ and
$Y=\left\{ (0,0),(0,1),(1/2,\sqrt{3}/2),(10,10)\right\} $. And the usual euclidean distance. I constructed $X$ so that for any two given points, their distance is always the same (=1). $Y$ contains $X$ and also another point that could be pretty much anything. Now I define $f(\textbf{x})=\textbf{x}$. Surely, $f$ is not surjective, but $d(f(a),f(b)) = d(a,b)$ for any $a,b \in X$. Is my reasoning right?","['metric-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'analysis']"
723153,Are pseudo(micro)-local operators pseudodifferential?,"$\DeclareMathOperator{supp}{supp} \DeclareMathOperator{sing}{sing}$Let $\Omega$ be a domain with compact closure in $\mathbb R^n$.

The famous Peetre's theorem, 1959, states that if 1. holds then $A|_{\Omega}$ is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients. The converse is clearly true. Now if $A$ is a proper pseudodifferential operator then 2. and 3. hold. But is the converse true?
