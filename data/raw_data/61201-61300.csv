688038,Asymptotic Relative Efficiency: Poisson,"I'm trying to find the asymptotic relative efficiency of a Poisson process: $$\frac{\lambda^t \exp(-\lambda)}{t!} =  P(X=t).$$ When $X = t = 0$, the best unbiased estimator of $e^{-\lambda}$ is ((n-1)/n)$^y$, where y = $\Sigma{X_i}$, the complete sufficient statistic for $\lambda$.
When $X = t = 1$, the best unbiased estimator of $\lambda e^{-\lambda}$ is $\frac{y}{n}\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^{y-1}$. It is stated that the asymptotic relative efficiency for $t=0$ is: ARE $$\left(\left( \frac{n-1}{n}\right)^{n \hat{\lambda}}, \quad\frac{y}{n}\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^{y-1}\right) = \left[\frac{e^{-\lambda}}{\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^{n\lambda}\log\left( \frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n}\right]^2$$ I'm not able to calculate this.","['statistics', 'probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-theory', 'asymptotics', 'probability']"

I know in two dimensions we just take the derivative of $D(x) = \sqrt{(a-x)^2+(b-f(x))^2}$ and equate it to zero to determine the shortest distance from $(a,b)$ to the curve $y=f(x)$, but how does this generalize to $n$-dimensions?",['geometry']

There is $a\in A, b\in B$ which are both limit points of $E$ (I think) Since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, $A\cap B=\emptyset$ The closure of a set is the ""smallest"" set which contains its limit points, (so it is a closed set as well). Both $A$ and $B$ are open so they are made up entirely of interior points, so they don't have any points on the boundary. I know that the definition of separated means that I have $A,B\subset X$, for which $A\cap \bar{B}=\emptyset=\bar{A}\cap B$, where the bar above the set denotes its closure. And I know that the definition of connected set means for $E\subset X$, $E$ is connected if $E$ is not the union of two non-empty separated sets, so a disconnected set would be for $E\subset X$, $E$   is disconnected if it is the union of two separated sets (which are both non-empty).

688268,My proof of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,"I've tried to prove the theorem in advance at the level that satisfies me. The notation used might not be correct, but I hope all major steps are correct. DEFINITION (from Apostol's Calculus I ): Let $f$ be a function that is integrable on $[a,x]$, for each $x$ in $[a,b]$. Let $c$ be such that $a \le c \le b$ and define a new function $A$ as follows:
$$A(x) = \int_c^xf(t)dt, a \le x \le b$$
Then the derivative $A'(x)$ exists at each point $x$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ where $f$ is continuous, and for such $x$ we have
$$A'(x) = f(x).$$ PROOF: I will show that the theorem is a consequence of the property of continuity of the function at some point. First we make some derivations. For simplicity lets assume that $h$ is positive. The proof for negative $h$ is no harder. $$A'(x) = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} =  \lim_{h\to0}\frac{\int_c^{x+h}f(t)dt - \int_c^{x}f(t)dt}{h} = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{\int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt}{h}$$ Since $f$ is continuous at $x$, for any number $\epsilon$ there is some $\delta$, such that when $t \in [x-\delta, x+\delta]$, $$f(x) - \epsilon \le f(t) \le f(x) + \epsilon$$ Then for any $h < \delta$, $$\int_x^{x+h} [f(x) - \epsilon]dt \le \int_x^{x+h} f(t)dt \le \int_x^{x+h} [f(x) + \epsilon]dt$$ $$[f(x) - \epsilon]h \le \int_x^{x+h} f(t)dt \le [f(x) + \epsilon]h$$ $$f(x) - \epsilon \le \frac {\int_x^{x+h} f(t)dt}{h} \le f(x) + \epsilon$$ I can make $\epsilon$ as small as possible, hence $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt}{h} = A'(x) = f(x)$$","['calculus', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

688333,Asymptotics for Mertens function,"It seems that the cumulative mean of the Mertens function is very similar in behaviour to $x$ raised to the power of the first zeta zero. I tentatively notate it as:

where $\text{c}\approx64,\ \rm{K}$ is Catalan's constant, $M(k)$ is the Mertens function of $k$, and $\rho_n$ is the nth zeta zero, and the $+2$ on the LHS is to account for the mean of the Mertens function being $\frac{1}{\zeta(0)}=-2$.
Below are plots up to $1000, 10\ 000$ and $100\ 000$. The wavelengths are as strikingly similar for small $x$ as they are for larger $x$.

688412,A problem about $\pi$-groups (Isaacs' Finite Group Theory),"I was trying to solve the following problem in Isaacs' Finite Group Theory : Let $G$ be a finite group, $\pi$ a set of primes. a) Show that there exists a (unique) normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $G/N$ is a $\pi$ -group and such that it is contained in any normal subgroup $M\lhd G$ such that $G/M$ is a $\pi$ -group. b) Show that this group $N$ is generated by the set of all elements in $G$ whose order is not divisible by any prime in $\pi$ . As for the first point I think I have no problems: I define $N$ to be the intersection of all the normal subgroups which satisfy the property in a) and I prove that this intersection is characteristic in $G$ and satisfies also the same property. As for the second point, I have proved that the generated subgroup must be contained in any normal subgroup with the property in a), and so it is contained in $N$ ; however, I cannot prove the other inclusion. I thought that the best way was to prove that this generated subgroup is normal in $G$ and again satisfies the same property. I proved that this subgroup, which I call $S$ , is characteristic in $G$ , hence normal, but I don't know how to prove that the quotient group $G/S$ is a $\pi$ -group. I tried to argue by contradiction: if there exists a prime $q$ not in $\pi$ which divides $|G/S|$ , then by Cauchy's Thm there will be an element $xS\in G/S$ of order $q$ ; then by using the isomorphism $\frac{G/S}{N/S}\cong G/N$ and the fact that $G/N$ is a $\pi$ -group it must be $x\in N$ .

688794,Cauchy representation and branch point order,"This question is about the nature of branch points which arise in certain Cauchy-integral representations of functions of a single complex argument, $z$ . The main application is for dispersion relations but we can ignore that connection since this is a straightforwardly mathematical question. (I posted to math.stackexchange but no attention, even with 50 point bounty.) Suppose we have the following representation: \begin{align}
f(z) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\Im f(x)}{x-z},
\end{align} where we assume the integral exists for $z=0$ .
This function has branch-point singularities at $z=0,\infty$ due to the fact that the (constant) endpoints of integration coincide with the pole of the integrand at those points. The question that I have regarding the order of the branch point is equivalent to understanding the behavior of $f(z)$ as a circuit is traced around the branch point $z=0$ . Suppose I define the ""first sheet"" as the values $f^{(I)}$ of $f(z)$ where $z=x_0+i\epsilon$ ( $\epsilon$ infinitesimal, as usual). I consider a circuit in the $z$ -plane as $z=x_0e^{i\theta}$ ( $0<\theta<2\pi$ ). The function is analytic at all points on this trajectory. Once, however, we consider $2\pi < \theta$ we must distort the contour to avoid the singularity in the integrand at $x=x_0$ . This effects the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ onto what we'll call the ""second sheet"". The value $f^{(II)}$ of $f(x_0)$ on the second sheet is \begin{align}
f^{(II)}(x_0) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\Im f^{(I)}(x)}{x-(x_0-i\epsilon)},\\
&= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\Im  f^{(I)}(x)}{x-x_0}-i\,\Im f^{(I)}(x_0).
\end{align} This demonstrates that $f(x_0+i\epsilon)-f(x_0-i\epsilon) = 2i\,\Im f(x_0)$ and shows that the integration contour is the branch cut. We can continue the above procedure, I believe, an arbitrary number of times. So the order of the branch point at $z=0$ appears to be of the logarithmic variety (of infinite order). My question: Is the branch point that arises from an endpoint singularity always logarithmic? (I suspect there should be way to obtain a square-root type of (or ""first order"") branch point from this Cauchy representation. But I don't see how to construct it given the above arguments.)","['mathematical-physics', 'quantum-field-theory', 'complex-analysis']"

It is not too hard to show that this is $\geq \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{1}{n} \approx \log x$, and in fact the difference be described succinctly as follows: if $s(m)$ denotes the largest squarefree factor of $m$, then $$\sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\mu(n)^2}{\varphi(n)} = \sum_{s(m) \leq x} \frac{1}{m}$$. In particular, one sees that the difference $$ \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\mu(n)^2}{\varphi(n)} - \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{1}{n} = \sum_{m > x, s(m) \leq x} \frac{1}{m}. $$ I would like to be able to bound how small this actually is. Montgomery-Vaughan cites an unpublished result of De Bruijn that is is actually $O(1)$, so I would certainly like to see that. The closeness of these sums is rather unintuitive to me (apart from the vague comment that $\varphi(n) \approx n$ unless $n$ has a lot of distinct prime factors, which should be relatively rare), so I would also appreciate any insight into why we could expect this.","['multiplicative-function', 'summation', 'analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

689085,A Theorem About Compactness and,"My first exposure to any sort of topology is from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds .  I think I understand compactness conceptually, I'm just finding the rigor a little bit elusive. My first question is regarding a bit of notation. I'm really not sure what $\{ x\} \times B $ is saying The theorem in question is Theorem : If $B$ is compact and $\mathcal O$ is an open cover of $\{x \} \times B$ , then there is an open set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ containing $x$ such that $U \times B$ is covered by finite number of sets in $\mathcal O.$ My second question is about the following proof: ( Original screenshot ) Proof .  Since $\{x\}\times B$ is compact, we can assume at the outset that $\def\O{\mathcal O}\O$ is finite, and we need only find the open set $U$ such that $U\times B$ is covered by $\O$ . For each $y\in B$ the point $(x,y)$ is in some open set $W$ in $\O$ .  Since $W$ is open, we have $(x,y)\in U_y\times V_y\subset W$ for some open rectangle $U_y\times V_y$ .  The set $V_y$ cover the compact set $B$ , so a finite number $V_{y_1}, \ldots V_{y_k}$ also cover $B$ .  let $U=U_{y_1}\cap\cdots\cap U_{y_k}$ .  Then if ( $x',y')\in U\times B$ , we have $y'\in V_{y_i}$ for some $i$ (Figure 1-4), and certainly $x'\in U_{y_i}$ .  Hence $(x',y')\in U_{y_i}\times V_{y_i}$ , which is contained in some $W$ in $\O$ . It's a bit difficult to understand the proof without knowing what $\{ x\} $ is, but it would appear to me that it is a set containing a point $x$ . The dimensionality of the subject has me confused. We're saying that ""for each $y \in B$ , there is a point $(x,y)$ in some open set $W$ . Why have we picked a two dimensional point instead of something more general? The figure used to illustrate the problem depicts a set in $\mathbb R ^2$ as well. The very name used ""open rectangle"" confuses me, it feels as though we're restricted to only describing things in two dimensional ""slices"". We next say that $(x,y)\in U_y \times V_y \subset W$ for some open rectangle. How do we know that the sets $V_y$ cover $B$ (and also why are we using a point in $\mathbb R ^2$ )?

The idea is that f should be infinitely differentiable like $e^x$ or $sin(x)$ without being periodic by differentiation.

689595,Exercise 1.11 of Eisenbud,"I'm doing the exercises from Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra with a view toward Algebraic Geometry , and I don't understand part of one of them, ex. 1.11 a): Exercise 1.11 a: Over $\mathbb{C}$, consider a circle and a parabola represented by $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1) \cap (y-2-x^2)$ [...]. Show that the ""projection from the north pole"" gives a bijection (given by rational functions) between the circle minus one point and the line minus two points. The only line appearing in the exercise is the line $x=0$, but since we can't project the circle from the north pole onto the line, let's assume that the line is $y=0$. We know that the stereographic projection gives a bijection between the circle minus one point and the whole line, so this is not the projection that we are looking for. Taking a look over the Hints and solutions, we have that the projection is precisely $t \mapsto (4t/(t^2+4), (t^2-4)/(t^2+4))$, which satisfies that it is a bijection between the circle minus $(0,1)$ and $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{2i, -2i\}$.

689658,Which kinds of geometry have an angle measure?,"It is possible to construct alternative planes to the usual Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ by replacing the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ with other ordered fields $F$. Depending on the choice of $F$, various properties or axioms of Euclidean geometry may or may not hold. For example, if $F$ is ""bigger"" than $\mathbb{R}$ in the sense that $\mathbb{R}$ is a proper subfield of $F$ (or also, if $F$ is really ""bigger"" in the sense of set cardinality, i.e. $|F| > \beth_1$), then the ""Archimedean axiom"" will fail: that is, there will exist line segments which are ""infinitely big"" or ""infinitely small"" compared to other line segments. In the old terminology of Euclid, there would be ""linear magnitudes"" which would not ""have a ratio"" to each other. In modern mathematics, it means that there exist line segments such that their length can be multiplied by any natural number and not exceed the length of some other line segments. Also, depending on what properties $F$ satisfies, other things may not be possible: for example, if $F$ is not ""real-closed"", then not all of Tarski's axioms for Euclidean geometry will hold. Depending on the $F$, lines and circles may not intersect when we might think they should. But what I'm curious about is this: what kinds of fields $F$ permit a natural definition of angle measure ? If $F$ is closed under the operation $\sqrt{1 + x^2}$, then a natural definition of distance measure is possible: $$d(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \sqrt{(v_x - u_x)^2 + (v_y - u_y)^2}$$ where $\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)$ are elements of $F^2$. This distance is an element of $F$. This comes from the Pythagorean theorem, and is just the familiar Euclidean distance, only now over a field which may not be the real numbers. But what about angle measure ? We may define an angle measure for $F = \mathbb{R}$ with the "" inner product "" of vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ being defined by $$\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_x v_x + u_y v_y$$ then the angle between two lines, represented as vectors, is $$\theta(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{||\mathbf{u}||\ ||\mathbf{v}||}\right)$$ where $||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}} = d(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{v})$ is the ""norm"" or length of the vector $\mathbf{v}$. At first, one might think this would only work on $\mathbb{R}$, but that isn't necessarily so: take $F = \ ^{*} \mathbb{R}$, where $^{*} \mathbb{R}$ is the so-called ""hyperreal numbers"" or ""non-standard real numbers"", which can be constructed via a set-theoretic construction called a ""ultrapower"" of $\mathbb{R}$. This is from ""non-standard analysis"", and this $F$ is non-Archimedean, and definitely not $\mathbb{R}$. In this field, there is a natural extension $\ ^{*} \cos^{-1}$ of the inverse cosine, and so we can use that and the above formula to get an angle measure. It may also be possible to define an angle measure (suitably restricted in range) for the mega-field (= too big to be a set, is a ""proper class"") $F = \mathbf{No}$, the mega-field of ""surreal numbers"" by Conway, also by extending the cosine (albeit in a different way). So clearly, the answer is ""more fields than just $\mathbb{R}$, but not every ordered field"". So which ordered fields allow for it? EDIT: It is asked to clarify what geometry is meant. I am specifically interested in the case of models of the Tarski's first order Euclidean plane geometry, which will be $F^2$ for a real closed ordered field $F$. Which permit the definition of an angle measure? We might also weaken things further by omitting the completeness axiom, so the $F$ need not be real closed.","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

Let $E$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable base, let $\cal{E}$ denote the Borel sigma-algebra on $E$, $(C_0(E),||\cdot||)$ denote the space of continuous real valued functions on $E$ which vanish at infinity (with supremum norm) and $(\rm b \cal{E},||\cdot||)$ that of bounded Borel measurable functions on $E$ (again with supremum norm) .

Exercise : Derive the following theorem from Theorem 1 using the Monotone Class Theorem. Theorem 2 : Suppose that $V:C_0(E)\to \rm b\cal{E}$ is a bounded linear operator such that $0\leq f\leq 1$ implies $0\leq Vf\leq1$. Then there exists a unique kernel $N:E\times\cal{E}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $i)$ for every $x$ in $E$ and $f$ in $C_0(E)$ $$Vf(x)=Nf(x):=\int N(x,dy)f(y),$$ $ii)$ for every $x$ in $E$ $N(x,\cdot)$ is a (non-negative) measure on $(E,\cal{E})$ such that $N(x,E)\leq 1$, $iii)$ for every $B$ in $\cal{E}$, $N(\cdot,B)$ is $\cal{E}$-measurable. Since for each $x$ in $E$, the map $f\mapsto Vf(x)$ is a linear function on $C_0(E)$, Theorem gives us signed measure $\mu_x$ of finite total variation $\mu_x$ such that $V f (x) = \mu_x(f)$. It seems to me that the way to start is to set $N(x,\cdot):=\mu_x(\cdot)$ for every $x$ in $E$ so that $N$ satisfies $i)$. But from there I'm unsure how to proceed; my immediate reaction was to come up with a way to approximate (w.r.t. to the supremum norm) $\rm b\cal{E}$ functions (in particular, indicator functions) with $C_0(E)$ functions. Then I realised that since $C_0(E)$ is complete, we can't do this. Furthermore, the exercise explicitly states that one can proof Theorem 2 using the Monotone Class Theorem, so there's something I'm missing.
