1064840,I don't understand a proof about volume and surface of revolution,"So I am investigating volume and surface of revolution, in particular the shape called Gabriel's Horn, which is
$$\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x}dx.$$ The interesting property about this shape is that it has finite volume but infinite surface area.The wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn offers a proof that the converse is impossible, i.e there is no solid of revolution with an infinite volume and finite surface area. Here's the thing: I don't understand their proof! Sorry about the weird inequalities, that's how the proof was shown on wikipedia.. Let f be a continuous differentiable function in $[1,\infty)$ $\lim_{t \to \infty} \sup_{x \geq t} f(x)^2 ~-~ f(1)^2 = \limsup_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} (f(x)^2)' \,\mathrm{d}x$ $\leqslant \int_{1}^{\infty} |(f(x)^2)'| \,\mathrm{d}x = \int_{1}^{\infty} 2 f(x) |f'(x)| \,\mathrm{d}x$ $\leqslant \int_{1}^{\infty} 2 f(x) \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} \,\mathrm{d}x = {A \over \pi} < \infty.$ Therefore, there exists a $t_0$ such that the supremum $\sup\{f(x) \mid x \geq t_0\}$ is finite. Hence, $M = \sup\{f(x) \mid x \geq 1\}$ must be finite since f is a continuous function, which implies that
f is bounded on the interval $[1,\infty)$ I numbered them to make it easier to answer questions or to help me understand what is going on here...

1064932,Does It Make Sense to Take the Partial Derivative of a Directional Vector?,"Let $\Omega$ be a domain in $\mathbb R^2$ and $C$ be a smooth curve wholly contained in $\Omega$.  Moreover, $C$ is parametrized by $x(t), y(t)$.  If $Q:  \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$ has continuous first-order partials, the directional derivative $D_n$ (in the direction of the unit normal) can be written as: $$D_nu = u_{x} y' - u_{y} x'$$ I don't believe that it makes sense to have $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} D_nu$ or $\frac{\partial}{\partial y} D_nu$.  But, if you look at $D_nu$ as a function of $t$, our parameter, then $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} D_nu = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} D_nu = 0$. This question came up when I was doing the proof to show that a harmonic $u$ is infinitely differentiable.  Suppose that $D$ is a Jordan domain inside $\Omega$.  Via Green's identity: $$u(x, y) = \frac{-1}{2\pi} \int_{\partial D} \text{ln}|(x, y) - \sigma(t)| D_nu - u(\sigma(t)) D_n \text{ln}|(x, y) -\sigma(t)| \space dt$$ Since the integrand is continuous, when we differentiate $u$ with respect to $x$, we can take the derivative operation inside the integral to yield ....

1064995,Marginal of Dirichlet distribution is Beta (integral),"Just for the sake of simplicity, take $K=3$ then a random vector $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ has a Dirichlet distribution, i.e. $(X_1,X_2,X_3)\sim Dirichlet(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$ if the density takes the form:
$$p(x_1, x_2) \propto x_1^{\alpha_1-1} x_2^{\alpha_2-1} (1-x_1-x_2)^{\alpha_3-1}.$$
The support is the $2$-dimensional simplex: $0<x_1,x_2,x_3<1$, $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$. The dependence is just on two variables because of the restriction $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$. So one can ask about the distribution of $X_1$ and $X_2$. My question is: How to prove (easily) that the marginals are Beta distributed. For instance, $X_1\sim Beta ( \tilde{\alpha}_1, \tilde{\alpha}_2)$ and what are the parameters? It should be:
$$p(x_1) = \int_0^1 p(x_1,x_2)dx_2 \propto x_1^{\alpha_1-1}\int_0^1 x_2^{\alpha_2-1} (1-x_1-x_2)^{\alpha_3-1} dx_2.$$ It is the latter integral I struggle with: I tried expanding the power using Newton's binomial but I get weird things.

I've considered modifying the $M$ distribution, but the exponential seems reasonable for my application. It's modelling something physical (diffusion of a single particle), but the magnitude $M$ is not determined by some well-defined rigourous process so it's quite possible the $M$ distribution has nothing to do with physics inherently. But I thought I could change the magnitude to the form $\sim \frac{1}{Z}e^{(k_bT)^{-1}U(m)}$ or even $\sim \frac{1}{Z}e^{-(k_bT)^{-1}U(m,x)} $ for some $U(\cdots)$'s if necessary, but I'm not sure if either of those would be physically justifiable.

Substituting back in we get $$2 \frac{1}{\frac{x^2}4 - 1} \frac x2 = \frac{4x}{x^2  - 4}$$ Using this arclenght formula I get $$L = \int_4^6 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{4x}{x^2  - 4}\right)^2}dx = \int_4^6 \sqrt{1 + \frac{16x^2}{(x^2  - 4)^2}}dx = \int_4^6 1 dx + \int_4^6 \frac{4x}{x^2-4}dx = 1.66 $$ But the correct answer is $2.81$ What did I do wrong?

1065373,How do I close the gap between intuitively knowing something is true vs being able to prove it?,"For example, one of my review problems is: Let $S_k$ be the kernel of $T^k$. Show there is a $K$ such that $S_K = S_{K+1} = \cdots$ Somewhere in the back of my brain there's an intuition that told me, ""Well duh , $K = \dim(T)$."" Obviously (to me anyway) once $K$ gets bigger than $\dim(T)$, you're either cycling around in some $T$-invariant subspace, or you're in the null space. My brain got there by envisioning a matrix in my head and thinking about what would happen to each vector in the domain until it was satisfied that $K=\dim(T)$ satisfies the prompt. At this point that part of my brain was content that a solution exists and moved on to something more interesting. But if I sit down and try to prove it with only the properties of transformations and subspaces, I don't even know where to start. Do I take a basis? Do I count dimensions? Nothing I try seems to get me anywhere. I think my brain is thinking about it the wrong way. Lower division math is about manipulating formulas and calculating. I got pretty good at doing that, and now my brain seems to attack every problem that way. I get the sense from talking to other (smarter) people that proofs are different. When my instructors come up with proofs they seem to be doing something completely different in their minds than I'm doing. To me it seems more akin to solving a puzzle than to manipulating equations. I don't see what they're doing that makes it so clear to them, in the way that lower division stuff is clear to me. I've heard many tips, including ""Write the first line and the last line of your proof, and then try to fill in the gaps."" And also, ""Write statements for everything you know is true in one place."" And also, ""Write as many statements as you can until you see something that can help you make the conclusion you need."" And so on. Those are good tips that help simplify the problem, but I feel like the real solution is rewiring my brain to think in a different way. Sitting here and looking at and doing dozens of proofs hasn't gotten me anywhere, so I'm hoping for some insight from some people smarter than I am.","['linear-algebra', 'proof-writing', 'intuition']"

I was unsure if the $)$ in $[a,b)$ completely changed the problem and made it false and I should be looking for a counterexample or if the following attempt worked. Since $f$ is continuous on $[a, b)$, then $f$ is integrable on $[a, b)$. Similarly, $f$ is integrable on $[b, c]$. Therefore by definition, let P$_1$ be a partition of $[a, b]$ s.t. $U(f, P_1) − L(f, P_1) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $P_2$ be a partition of $[b, c]$ s.t $U(f, P_2) − L(f, P_2) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Therefore, $P = P_1 \cup P_2$ is a partition of $[a, c]$. Since $b$ is the right endpoint of $P_1$ and the left endpoint of $P_2$, then $U(f, P) − L(f, P) = U(f, P_1) + U(f, P_2)−L(f, P_1)−L(f, P_2) = U(f, P_1)−L(f, P_1) +U(f, P_2)−L(f, P_2)< \frac{\epsilon}{2}+ \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon$.

Prove the following: (a) If $g \circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective. Proof. Assume that $f$ is not injective. Then there exists $a,b \in A$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$ and $ a \ne b$ . It follows that there is an $a,b \in A$ such that $g(f(a)) = g(f(b))$ but $a \ne b$ , demonstrating that $g$ is not injective. $\Box$ (b) If $g \circ f$ is surjective then $g$ is surjective. Proof. Assume that $g \circ f$ is surjective. Then for every $c \in C$ , there exists an $a \in A$ for which $g(f(a)) = c$ . Since $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ , for each $a \in A$ there is a unique $b \in B$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Consequently, there exists an element $b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c$ . Thus $g$ is surjective. $\Box$ Suppose that $g : B \to C$ is a function. (a) Show that $g$ is injective if and only if for any set $A$ and any two functions $f_1,f_2: A \to B$ one has $g \circ f_1 = g \circ f_2 \Rightarrow f_1 = f_2$ . Proof. Assume that $g$ is injective and $g(f_1(x)) = g(f_2(x))$ for each $x \in A$ . Injectivity yields $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$ , so $g$ is left cancellable. Now assume that $g \circ f_1 = g \circ f2$ implies $f_1 = f_2$ . Thus $g$ must be injective, otherwise we could find $f_1, f_2 : A \to B$ such that $f_1(x) \ne f_2(x).$ This completes the proof in both directions. $ \Box$ (b) Show that $g$ is surjective if and only if for any set $D$ and any two functions $h_1,h_2: C \to D$ one has $h_1 \circ g = h_2 \circ g \Rightarrow h_1 = h_2$ . Proof. Suppose that $g$ is surjective and $h_1(g(b)) = h_2(g(b))$ for some $b \in B$ . Then for every $c \in C$ there exists a $b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c.$ Now if $h_1(g(b)) = h_2(g(b))$ then $h_1(c) = h_2(c)$ and $h_1 = h_2$ , so $g$ is right cancellable. Now suppose that $g$ is not surjective. Then for all $b \in B$ , there exists at least one $c_0 \in C$ such that $g(b) \ne c_0$ . Let $D = \{m,n\}$ and define $h_1: C \to \{m,n\}$ by $h_1(c) = m$ and $h_2: C \to \{m,n\}$ by $h_2(c) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} m  : c \ne c_0\\n : c = c_0 \end{array}\right. $ .

1065786,Is Orzech's generalization of the surjective-endomorphism-is-injective theorem correct?,"In math.stackexchange answer #239445 , Makoto Kato quoted a statement from the paper Morris Orzech, Onto Endomorphisms are Isomorphisms , Amer. Math. Monthly 78 (1971), 357--362. The statement (Theorem 1 in said paper) claims that if $A$ is a commutative ring, if $M$ is a finitely-generated $A$-module, if $N$ is an $A$-submodule of $M$, and if $f : N \to M$ is a surjective $A$-linear map, then $f$ is also injective. This claim generalizes the well-known fact that a surjective endomorphism of a finitely-generated $A$-module is injective (which appears, e.g., as Lemma 10.15.4 in the Stacks project, Version 5b422bc, compiled on Nov 05, 2014 -- the numbering will probably change but it is Lemma {lemma-fun} in algebra.tex -- and I am citing this because the Stacks project has an interesting alternative proof of this fact). Orzech's proof first deals with the case of $A$ noetherian and then reduces the general case to it. Unfortunately, the reduction step is wrong: the map $f$ is applied to elements of $M$ which are not known to belong to $N$. (The proof in Orzech's paper is the same as the one in Kato's post.) Is the claim itself true for non-Noetherian $A$ ?

1065800,On the importance of order for bases in finite dimensional vector spaces,"I am reading Tapp's Introduction to Matrix Groups for Undergraduates and he writes: Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional (left) vector space over $\mathbb K$. Then $V$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb K^n$. In fact, there are many isomorphisms from $V$ to $\mathbb K^n$. For any ordered basis $v_1, \dots, v_n$ of $V$ the following is an isomorphism: $(c_1 v_1 + \dots + c_n v_n) \mapsto (c_1, \dots, c_n)$ My question is: (1) Are all finite dimensional bases in linear algebra courses in general automatically assumed to be ordered because writing $b_1, \dots, b_n$ is an order? (2) It seems to me that the order is irrelevant in the sense that the isomorphism above could just as well map $(c_1 v_1 + \dots + c_n v_n) \mapsto (c_n, \dots, c_1)$. Hence my question: is it possible to give an isomorphism without using an ordered basis?",['linear-algebra']

1065852,Showing that the map $f(z) = \frac{1}{z} $ maps circles into circles or lines,"Let $f: \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0 \} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\} $. We want to show that $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$ maps circles into circles and lines. My professor gave the following hint: The general equation for lines and circles is $$ \alpha(x^2 + y^2) + \beta x + \gamma y + \Delta = 0 $$ where the greek letters are obviously constants. So, given this advice, We can rewrite this in the complex plane as follows: $$ \alpha |z|^2 + \frac{ \beta}{2}( z + \overline{z} ) + \frac{\gamma}{2i}( z - \overline{z} ) + \Delta = 0$$ So, now we apply $w = \frac{1}{z} $ and we obtain (with $|w|^2 = w \overline{w}$): $$ \frac{ \alpha}{w \overline{w}} + \frac{\beta}{2}\bigg( \frac{1}{w} + \frac{1}{\overline{w}}\bigg) + \frac{\gamma}{2 i}\bigg( \frac{1}{w}- \frac{1}{\overline{w}}\bigg)+ \Delta = 0$$ hence, $$ \alpha + \frac{ \beta}{2}(\overline{w} + w ) + \frac{\gamma}{2i}(\overline{w}-w) + w \overline{w} \Delta = 0 $$ Next, putting $w = u + iv$ we arrive to: $$ \alpha + \beta u - \gamma v + (u^2 + v^2 ) \Delta = 0 $$ So, in the case when we have circles in $xy$-plane, that is when $\alpha \neq 0$, we still have circles in the $uv$-plane. So $f$ sends circles to circles if $\alpha \neq 0 $. We also have circle if $\alpha \neq 0 $ and $\Delta = 0$ which in this case $\frac{1}{z} $ sends circles to lines. Is this a correct solution? IS there a shorter way to prove this?",['complex-analysis']
1065858,Two ways of finding a Potential of a Vector Field,"If $\vec{F}(x,y)$ is a conservative vector field and we want to find a function $V$ such that $\nabla(V)=\vec{F}$, then one way to do it is to take an arbitrary point $(x_0,y_0)$ and then define $V(x,y)$ to be the line integral of $\vec{F}$ along an arbitrary curve $C$ from $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x,y)$.  ($V$ is well-defined because the line integral is path-independent.) But there's another way to find a potential of a conservative vector field: you use the fact that $\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = F_x$ to conclude that $V(x,y)$ must be of the form $\int_a^x F_x(u,y) du + G(y)$, and similarly $\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = F_y$ implies that $V(x,y)$ must be of the form $\int_b^y F_y(x,v) du + H(x)$.  So you find functions $G(y)$ and $H(x)$ such that $\int_a^x F_x(u,y) du + G(y) = \int_b^y F_y(x,v) du + H(x)$ My question is, how do the two methods produce the same result?  Specifically, given a function $V$ constructed using the first method, how can you find a function $G(y)$ corresponding to it?  For any specific vector field $\vec{F}(x,y)$ you can just find it by inspection, but is it possible to come up with a general expression for it in terms of the line integral of $F$?  Similarly, is there a general expression for $H(x)$?

1066176,Why are every structures I study based on Real number?,"I've been studying basic concepts of inner product vector space, normed vector space and metric space. And all the inner products, norms and metrics are defined to be real-valued functions in my textbook. I doubted about it: why do I have to restrict the measurement standard to real number? Why not any ordered field? Why not… anything else? I do know that there can be a lot of different ways to define 'distance': I'm studying topology, too. I'm just wondering if there is any more general definition to the inner product space, normed space, or metric space(my definition is just the standard one being taught at undergraduate level: only real-valued ones as I've mentioned). For example, let $V$ be an $F$-vector space and $F_s$ be an ordered field embedded into $F$. Then I defined like this: $\langle v, v\rangle=0$ if and only if $v$ is the $0$ vector $\langle v, v\rangle>0$ (so the value is in $F_s$) $\langle av, u\rangle=a\langle v, u\rangle$ where $a\in F$ $\langle v+u, z\rangle=\langle v, z\rangle+\langle u, z\rangle$ $\langle v, u\rangle=\langle u, v\rangle$ We can define the normed vector space in this fashion as well. I think this is a more general definition: I couldn't find anything wrong about it. I mean, if we define $\|v\|=\langle v, v\rangle^{1/2}$ then indeed $(V, \|\,\|)$ becomes a normed vector space according to my definition, as it should in the ordinary definition (I think the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which connects the two spaces also hold in this general definition: I've checked the proof in my textbook and it does not use any property of the real number). Is my definition not right, or not useful? If so, then why? I know that the real number is the only (up to isomorphism) ordered field with the least upper bound property and the property that every increasing bounded sequence converges. But is that enough to justify that every metric spaces use real number? I want to be more convinced, then. A little bit disorganized, but I just wanted to hear some other people's opinion about this. Thanks as always. P.S. I also know about the complex inner product vector space. The inner product there is complex-valued, so I think it was the start of my questioning.","['normed-spaces', 'inner-products', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
1066191,Prove a quotient group is abelian,"Let $G$ be a group with a normal subgroup $M$ such that $G/M$ is abelian. Let $N\geq M$ and $N \unlhd G$. Show $G/N$ is abelian. My attempt : To show that $G/N$ is abelian, we need to show that for all $x,y \in N,~ xNyN=yNxN$ $G/M$ is abelian, so for any $x,y \in M, xMyM=yMxM$. Since $M$ is a subgroup of $N$, the cosets $xM$ and $yM$ are in $B$. Then, I am stuck, but I feel like I should construct some sort of algebraic manipulation to show $G/N$ is abelian.

1066202,A problem with proving using definition that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac {n^2-1}{n^2+1}=1$,"Prove using the definition that: $$\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac {n^2-1}{n^2+1}=1 $$ What I did: Let $\epsilon >0$, finding $N$: $\mid\frac {n^2-1}{n^2+1}-1\mid=\mid\frac {-2}{n^2+1}\mid\le\mid\frac {-2}{n^2}\mid=\frac {2}{n^2}\le\frac {2}{n}$ So $N=\frac 2 {\epsilon}$. So for all $n>N$ we'll want to show that: $|a_n-l|<\epsilon \Rightarrow \mid\frac {n^2-1}{n^2+1}-1\mid=\mid\frac {-2}{n^2+1}\mid<\mid\frac {-2}{N^2} \mid=\mid\frac {-2}{\frac 1 {\epsilon^2}} \mid=\mid -2\epsilon^2 \mid=2\epsilon^2$ But that isn't smaller than $\epsilon$ so I'm doing something wrong here and I don't know what...","['epsilon-delta', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"
1066220,Hypothetical contradiction to Bolzano-Weierstrass,"we've learned about the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem that states that if a sequence is bounded, then it has a subsequence that converges to a finite limit. 
Let's define $a_n$ as the digits of $\pi$, i.e. $a_1$ = 3, $a_2$ = 1, $a_3$ = 4, and so on infinitely. Certainly this sequence is bounded by 10 and 0, but I can't think of any subsequence that will converge to anything. 
Can you help solve my confusion?",['limits']
1066274,Number of solutions of a simple equation,"Problem How to count the number of distinct integer solutions $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ of the equations like : $$|x_1| + |x_2| + \cdots + |x_n| = d $$ the count gives the number of coordinate points in the $n$-dimensional space which are at distance equal to  $d$ [a non-negative-integer] from the origin [ where we are only allowed to move along the grid lines ]. That is distance between $2$ points $x$ and $y$ is defined as $|x_1-y_1|+\dots +|x_n-y_n|$. I know how to calculate for non-negative solutions for the equation : $$x_1 + x_2 + \dots+ x_n = d $$ which is$^{n+d-1}C_{n-1}$, i.e. $x_i \geq  0$ but in the new problem we have upper and lower bounds as well i.e. $x_n\in [-d,d]$. I don't know that there is any formula for this or not ? Also I want to know the number of distinct solutions for the equation for large $n$ efficiently : $$|x_1| + |x_2| + \dots + |x_n| \leq d.$$ Thank you in advance.","['coordinate-systems', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"
1066298,Find the derivative of the inverse of an antiderivative,"Find $(f^{-1})'(0)$ if $f(x) = \int_1^x{ \cos(\cos t)dt}$ For the problem there was no interval given so that the function $\cos(\cos t)$ was strictly increasing (which we need for inverse) Can I just pick any interval that works, say $0$ to $\pi/2$? Secondly I know by FTC that since $\cos(\cos t)$ is continuous that $f$ is differentiable. How does the integral integral over $[1,x]$ come into play here? Do I need to take an antiderivative? Any hints would be wonderful.","['inverse', 'calculus', 'integration', 'derivatives']"
