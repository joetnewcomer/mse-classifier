2170013,Looking for a decreasing function which initially decreases slowly and then decreases fast after a point,"I am looking for a nice decreasing function $f(t)$ for modelling, which starts at a maximum value of $1$ initially i.e. $f(0) = 1$, then decreases slowly initially until a value of $m$ ($0 < m < 1$) in time $t_{1}$ i.e $f(t_{1} = m)$. After $t_{1}$, the function quickly decreases and its value at time $t_{2}$ is near $0$ ($f(t_{2}) \approx 0$). I have few points so fitting spline or other polynomials overshoot the maximum value of 1. I can threshold the value to 1, but the straight line looks ugly. The second constraint of $f(t_{2} \approx 0$) is not strict, provided the value falls rapidly after $t_{1}$. Should I try to generate more points and try curve fitting or is there any other solution?","['exponential-function', 'functions']"

I am trying to show that this is $not$ isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$. One approach I tried was to compare cardinalities.

2170078,Why are $n$ zeroes appended at the end of a number when it is multiplied by $10^n$?,"Let us take a simple example where $n=1$. When a single digit number, say $a$ is multiplied by $10^1$, the answer comes out to be ""$a0$"". If a number is $a_1a_2a_3\dots a_k$, then multiplication with $10^1$ gives ""$a_1a_2a_3\dots a_k0$"". If number is multiplied with $10^2=100$, then there are $2$ zeroes at the end. Following the same pattern, if a certain number with any decimal part is multiplied with $10^n$, there are $n$ zeroes at the last. This all is super$^\infty$ easy and obvious, but is there an even simpler or somewhat intuitive reason why these all zeroes are just ""attached"" to the number, an explanation which is suitable for a small kid who is a newbie at Mathematics? As far as I think, there is no suitable explanation which is ""simple"" enough for a kid to understand. Excpeting the ""suitable for newbie"" clause, is there some interesting interpretation of multiplication with powers of $10$ ? If we interpret Multiplication as a ""Repetitive Addition"", for example $a \times b$ is just $\underbrace {a+a+\dots +a}_{\text{b times}}$, then also it is not quite ""intuitive"" why there suddenly appears a zero out of nowhere when $b=10^c \,\,;c \in \mathbb{N}$.

2170317,The image of every strictly non-expanding map between spheres is contained in an open hemisphere?,"$\renewcommand{\S}{\mathbb{S}^n}$
$\renewcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$
$\newcommand{\conv}{\operatorname{Conv}}$
$\newcommand{\Int}{\operatorname{Int}}$ This is a follow-up of this question . Let $f:A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be a map which strictly decreases distances, i.e $$d(f(x),f(y)) <d(x,y) \, \text{  for every } x,y \in A.$$ ($d$ can be either the intrinsic distance or the Euclidean one, it does not matter) Is it true that $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of some hemisphere? Is it contained in a disk with (intrinsic) radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$? Edit: It turns out that $f(A)$ is not necessarily contained in a disk with radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$. George Lowther gave the following nice example: Fix a meridian line joining north and south poles on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. Let $f:\mathbb{S}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2$ map each point to the unique point on the meridian with the same latitude. Then $f$ strictly reduces the distance between any two points which do not have the same longitude*. Let $A$ be any set containing points arbitrarily close (but not equal) to both the north and south poles, all of which have distinct longitudes. Restricting  $f$ to $A$ gives the counterexample: Indeed, $f(A)$ contains points on a great semi-circle (the fixed meridian) which are arbitrarily close to the north and south pole. If $f(A)$ was contained in a disk of radius $\frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon$, then by triangle inequality the distance of every two points in it would be less than or equal to $\pi-2\epsilon$, a contradiction. Note however that $f(A)$ does lie in the interior of a hemisphere -look at the hemisphere centered in the middle point of the meridian , and recall the north and south poles were left out from $A$, and hence also from $f(A)$. Finally, if we try to include one of the poles in $A$, in an attempt to produce a counter-example for the weaker conjecture, we will destroy the strict distance decreasing property of $f$. (Distance of a point to the pole depends only on the latitude). *The fact that $f$ is strictly decreasing distance between points which do not have the same longitude follows immediately from the formula for the spherical distance: $\Delta\sigma=\arccos\bigl(\sin\phi_1\cdot\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos(\Delta\lambda)\bigr)$ Partial Results: An argument here (pg 7, lemma 2.8), shows that the convex hull of $f(A)$ does not contain the origin. Hence, $\, f(A)$ is contained in a closed hemisphere. (This follows from the hyperplane separation theorem). Moreover, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n $ is compact then the answer is positive : Since $f(A)$ is compact, $\operatorname{conv}(f(A))$ is compact. Any closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which does not contain the origin $\bar O$, is contained in a closed half-space which does not contain $\bar O$ (by the strong hyperplane separation theorem). In particular, $\operatorname{conv}(f(A))$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$, so $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of a hemisphere. Thus, if $A$ is not closed, a naive approach would be to try to extend it to the closure of $A$. However, we might lose the strict distance-decreasing nature of $f$ in the extension, which is necessary for the argument showing $\operatorname{conv}(f(A))$ does not contain the origin.","['convex-geometry', 'convex-hulls', 'contraction-operator', 'geometry', 'lipschitz-functions']"
2170322,A puzzle with some jumping frogs,"(The following puzzle is ispired by this nice video of Gordon Hamilton on Numberphile) In a pond there are $n$ leaves placed in a circle, for convenience they are numbered clockwise by $0,1,\ldots,n-1$. At the beginning, on each leaf there is a frog, so there are $n$ frogs. At each turn, the frogs can jump accordingly to the following rule: ""If on leaf $j$ there are $k \geq 1$ frogs and if on leaf $(j + k) \bmod n$ there is at least one frog, then all the $k$ frogs on leaf $j$ can jump on leaf $(j + k) \bmod n$"". Is it true that the $n$ frogs can finally be all on the same leaf if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$? It is quite easy to prove that if $n$ is a power of $2$ then there is a sequence of jumps that leads all the frogs on the same leaf. On the other hand, I checked by a brute force algorithm that no such sequence exists if $n \leq 14$ is not a power of $2$.","['puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

2170547,J invariant of Elliptic Curve a Cross Ratio,"From what I understand, to calculate the J-invariant of an elliptic curve $E$, one can choose an involution of the elliptic curve, and quotienting out by the action of the involution defines a branched double cover of $$E\to\mathbb{CP}^1\,.$$ There are four branch points, and the j-invariant associated to the cross ratio of these 4 branch points is the j-invariant. Is this correct so far? Then my question is: There seems to be a lot of involutions, almost one for each point of $E$ at least. Is it obvious that the j-invariant is independent of which involution you choose (or perhaps more generally independent of the branched double cover). Also, I've read that two biholomorphic elliptic curves have branch points which can be mapped onto one another by an element of $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})\,.$ I know that  $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ are the automorphisms of $\mathbb{CP}^1\,,$ but I don't see the relation. Does a biholomorphism of $E$ induce an automorphism on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ or something like that? Presumably I can just calculate the j-invariant for each involution and check, but I'm not sure if there isn't a better way of seeing it.","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'branch-points']"
2170557,Limits of Integration Over Iterated Region,"For $\epsilon>0$ and $y\gg\epsilon$ I have an integral on the region $$P(n,y)=\left\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n\;:\; \sum_k^nx_k\geq y, \;x_i\geq \epsilon, \forall i \right\}.$$
    I want to explicitly write down the limits of integration when the integral is broken down. For example, for $n=1,2$
    $$\int_{P(1,y)}f(x)d(x)=\int_y^{\infty}f(x)dx$$
    $$\int_{P(2,y)}f(x)d(x) = \int_{\epsilon}^{y-\epsilon}\int_{y-x_2}^{\infty}f(x_1,x_2)dx_1dx_2+ \int_{y-\epsilon}^{\infty}\int_{\epsilon}^{\infty}f(x_1,x_2)dx_1dx_2$$ Up to $n=3$ it is easy to visualize. The region $P(3,y)$ is just getting everything except a small ``triangle"" near the origin. In the lower level, each slice is simply the region $P(2,\cdot)$, but after the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=\epsilon$ intersects the $x_3$-axis you just get a giant cube. With this, I have written the regions for $P(3,y)$ as

    My goal is to write out the integral without any $P_n$'s. For $n=3$, the reasoning above leads to the explicit limits
    $$\int_{P_3}=\int_{\epsilon}^{y-2\epsilon}\int_{\epsilon}^{y-x_3-\epsilon}\int_{y-x_1-x_2}^\infty+\int_{\epsilon}^{y-2\epsilon}\int^{\infty}_{y-x_3-\epsilon}\int_{\epsilon}^\infty+\int^{\infty}_{y-2\epsilon}\int_{\epsilon}^{\infty}\int_{\epsilon}^\infty$$ For general $n\geq 2$, I am looking for something like

Thanks, UPDATE: I think I found something much simpler.

$$\int_{D(n,y)}dx_1\ldots dx_n=\int_{\epsilon}^{y-(n-1)\epsilon}\int_{\epsilon}^{y-(n-2)\epsilon-x_{n-1}}\int_{\epsilon}^{y-(n-3)\epsilon-x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}}\cdots\int_{\epsilon}^{y-\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}dx_1\ldots dx_n$$ Use these two results to rewrite the integral over $P(n,y)$.","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'iterated-integrals']"

This seems to have been carried further, see the expression for $k^+_{[a,b]}(x)$ for $x = a+1$ should be $$ k⁺_{[a,b]}(x)  = \frac{1}{\sum_{x= a+1}^b \exp(\log n[w^n((y-1) /\log^2n) - w^n(a /\log^2n)])} $$","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'random-walk']"

The zeta-function regularization is one of such ways that, as an example, assign the value $-\frac{1}{12}$ to the infinite series $S=1+2+3+4+...$ using the fact that the zeta-function $\zeta(s)$ is the analytic continuation of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}$, and $\zeta(-1)=-\frac{1}{12}$.

Is the following correct? Is there an easier way to do this? If $1)$ is false, then there is an $\epsilon >0$ such that for all $x\in X$ with $\left \| x \right \|\le 1,\ $ there is an $1\le i\le n$ such that $|f_ix-c_i|>\epsilon. $  This means that for each $x\in X; \left \| x \right \|\le 1$, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $(f_1(x),\cdots ,f_n(x))$ which does not contain $(c_1,\cdots, c_n).$ So there is a $\Lambda:\mathbb C^n\to \mathbb C$ and $r\in \mathbb R$ such that $\Re \Lambda u\le r\le \Re \Lambda (c_1,\cdots, c_n)$ for all $u\in \bigcup _{\left \| x \right \|\le 1}U_x.$ But since $\mathbb C^n$ is an inner product space, we can use Riesz to say that $\lambda x=\langle x,d\rangle$ for some $d=(d_1,\cdots, d_n).$ Then we have $\sup_{\left \| x \right \|\le 1} \Re \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_if_i(x))\le \Re \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_ic_i \le \left | \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_ic_i \right |$. Now we use the fact that $\left \{ \left \| x\le1 \right \| \right \}$ is balanced to prove that the left hand side of this inequality is $\left \|\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_if_i  \right \|,$ which would give the desired contradiction: in fact, in general, if $f$ is a continuous linear functional, then there is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $B(0,1)$ such that $|f(x_n)|\to \left \| f \right \|.$ Now choose $\beta_n\in \mathbb C$ so that $|\beta_n|=1$ and $\beta_nf(x_n)$ is real. Then, $|f(x_n)|=|\beta_nf(x_n)|=|f(\beta_nx_n)|\to \left \| f \right \|.$ Since $\beta_nx_n\in B(0,1),$ the result follows because now we have $\left \| f \right \|=\lim |f(\beta_nx_n)|\le\sup_{\left \| x\le 1 \right \|}\Re f(x)\le \sup_{\left \| x\le 1 \right \|}|f(x)|=\left \| f \right \|.$ From here Goldstine's Theorem follows because if we take a $\gamma \in X^{**}$ in the closed unit weak*- ball, consider the arbitrary neighborhood $U=\left \{ \eta\in X^{**}:|\eta f_i-\gamma f_i|<\epsilon ; 1\le i\le n \right \}$ and note that since $\left \| \gamma \right \|\le 1, $ and since for any $d_i\in \mathbb C$ we have $\left | \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_i \gamma (f_i) \right |=\left | \gamma \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_if_i \right ) \ \right |\le \left \|  \sum_{i=1}^{n}d_if_i \right \|, $ the lemma applies to show there is an $x\in X$ such that $\left \| x\right \|\le 1$ and $|f_ix-c_i|<\epsilon$ and all it remains to do is take $c_i=\gamma f_i$ to see that $f_ix\in U.$","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

2171200,"Intuition Regarding Countability of Infinite Sets and Infinite Sets as ""Whole Objects""","I have some issue wrapping my mind around the concepts of enumeration of infinite sets, and infinite sets as whole complete objects in general. I know a lot of people struggle with this, and some people (even some of the greatest mathematicians of all time) have resisted these notions. I just want to get past the point where I’m haunted by ambiguities that I perceive through standard explanations. The first thing I want to clear up is the notion that an infinite set can be enumerated. I know that we say that an infinite set is enumerable if it can be put into bijection with the natural numbers. This makes sense from the surface, but my senses fail me at the part where we assume that such a set can actually be “enumerated” in the sense of a verb, i.e. enumeration is an action that on an infinite set can be completed. My intuition suggests that such a definition is actually only a rule for enumeration, but there is no such thing as a completed enumeration. The idea being that you “can describe how to do something that cannot be done"". With this problem I have a problem conceptualizing Cantors diagonalization proof. It goes by assuming something is an enumeration of some infinite set. Then it selects something not in that set by selecting something that differs by value for each digit with respect to every element in the enumerated set. It seams like you first need the notion that selecting this new element can ever be done, since there is no end (no base case where such a procedure would ever end). Such an element seams ""un-selectable"" by nature purely by assumption that the supposedly enumerated set is infinite. So to me it seams like trying to select this element is a little like trying to select the largest natural number. Maybe I am coming at this from the wrong angle.

Proof: This amounts to showing that the set $M = \{ m \in \mathbb{N} : m \leq a_{0}\}$, where $a_{0}$ is the first member from any sequence in infinite descent, is finite. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists an $a_{0}$ such that the set $M$ is infinite. We suppose further that $a_{0}$ is minimal. Clearly $a_{0} \neq 0$, for if it were, the set $M = \{ m \in \mathbb{N} : m \leq 0\}$ = $\{0\}$ is finite. Consider the set $N = M - \{n \in \mathbb{N}: a_{1} < n \leq a_{0}\}$, which is just the set $M$ with the finitely many naturals deleted. From elementrary set theory, $N$ must be infinite. But $N = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n \leq a_{1}\}$, and we can suppose that $a_{1}$ is the first term in a natural number sequence in infinite descent. Thus we have found another infinite set with the desired property, but with $a_{1} < a_{0}$.

We're organising team activities in our company for the next few days. Our team consists of $n$ people seated on a circular table. To spice it up, we plan to do it in such a way that no single person has to sit with the same pair of people on any two given days. What's the longest period of time for which this can be done, without running out of arrangements? The upper-bound to this is, of course, $\binom{n-1}2$, because if we pick a member and find the number of ways to seat neighbours around him, we see that it is $\binom{n-1}2$. Since this pair of neighbours can only be seated once on that day, by pigeonhole (or whatever it's called) we cannot pick any more combinations after $\binom{n-1}2$ days.

Then there is the following: Lemma: If $Y$ is connected, then the projection $\pi_G : Y \rightarrow Y/G $ is a covering map of $Y$ onto $Y/G$. Proof: The map is surjective, then given $x \in Y/G$ there exists an open neighbourhood $V \ni x$ such that $V= \pi_G (U)$ and $U$ has the property that $\{ gU \}_{g \in G}$ are pairwise disjoint.

2171487,Incorrect proof of the Open Mapping Theorem,"I was following the proof of the Open Mapping Theorem in Lang's Real and Functional Analysis and something odd happened. I was able to simplify a lot his proof. Not only that, but I was able to improve the theorem itself. My proof is valid for any normed space, not only Banach spaces. Of course I know this can't be the case, but still, I wasn't able to find where my proof got wrong. If you spot the mistake, please tell me. Open Mapping Theorem: Let $X,Y$ be Banach spaces and let $f:X \to Y$ be a linear continuous map. If $f$ is surjective, then it is also open. Proof: For any $s>0$, we will denote $B_s = \{ x\in X:\ \|x\| < s \}$ and $C_s = \{ y \in Y:\ \|y\| < s \}$. First, note that since $X$ is surjective, we have $$ f(X) = f(\cup_{n=1}^\infty B_n) = Y.$$
Also, note that $s < t \implies B_s \subset B_t$. In particular, this means that $\cup_{n=1}^N B_n \subset B_t$, for any $t > N$. Then for any $r > 0$, there is a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $C_r \subset f(B_{kr})$. Now let $U \subset X$ be an open set and let $x \in U$ be an arbitrary point. By definition, there is a $t > 0$ such that $x + B_t \subset U$. Then $$f(x+B_t) = f(x) + f(B_t) \subset f(U).$$ Given any $r>0$, we know there is a $k \in \mathbb{K}$ such that $C_r \subset f(B_{kr})$. The it follows that $$f(B_t) = f\left(\frac{t}{kr} B_{kr}\right) = \frac{t}{kr} f(B_{kr}) \supset \frac{t}{kr} C_r = C_\frac{t}{k}.$$ Therefore, $$f(x) + C_\frac{t}{r} \subset f(x) + f(B_t) \subset f(U). $$ This proves $f(x)$ is in the interior of $f(U)$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, we conclude that every point of $f(U)$ is in its interior, so $f(U)$ is open. $\hspace{1cm}\square$ Thank you!","['banach-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'open-map']"

But I have always been confused about this definition for two reasons. Many texts provide an example such as $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and say that it is homogeneous of degree 1. But $\sqrt{(tx)^2+(ty)^2}=\sqrt{t^2(x^2+y^2)}=|t|\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, so does this mean a function is still homogeneous if it factors out the absolute value of $t$? Every definition I've seen doesn't specify that $k$ has to be a whole number, but I haven't seen any examples where $k=\frac{1}{2}$ for example. Can $k$ be any real number? I am wondering if the answer to the first question is simply that when solving a homogeneous differential equation, the sign of $t$ is irrelevant because it is taken care of by the constant in the general solution, or something similar. And for the second question, I am wondering if $k$ is implied to be a whole number, or if we don't see examples where $k=\frac{1}{2}$ simply because they are too hard to work with.","['homogeneous-equation', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

and then interpret the solution as an analytic series of the operators $B$ and $A^{-1}$. Does this have any chance of succeeding, and if so how can we invert $A$ ?

Indeed, this identity is key in showing that given a connection $\nabla$ with connection 1-form matrix $\Omega$ and curvature tensor $R$, $R(X,Y)(Z)=\nabla^2(Z)(X,Y)$(or the curvature matrix of $R$ is indeed $d\Omega-\Omega \wedge \Omega$). Since Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ measures(in some sense) how far the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ are off from forming local co-ordinates, we can think of the term $\omega[X,Y]$ as making 'adjustments', but I wonder whether there are better interpretations of this identity. The cases where $X=\partial/\partial x^i$ and $Y=\partial/\partial x^j$ do return what is expected- that is, $d\omega(x,y)=\partial \omega^j/\partial x^i-\partial \omega^i/\partial x^j$, but it doesn't really contribute to explaining the $\omega[X,Y]$ term.","['connections', 'lie-derivative', 'differential-geometry']"
2171884,What is wrong with this infinity proof?,"Whilst learning about infinities, I attempted to construct a proof by contradiction that the continuum of real numbers ($\aleph_1$) could not be represented by the set of positive integers ($\aleph_0$). It is as follows (simplified): Let $x$ be a real number where $0 \leq x < 1$. Interpret $x$ as a base-2 string of the form $0.d_1d_2d_3d_4\dots$. Let there be an $\aleph_0$-dimensional cube.  Each value of $x$ can be represented as the coordinate $(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 \dots)$ which is a vertex of the cube, therefore there exists a mapping of each real number onto an $\aleph_0$-dimensional cube. An $n$-dimensional cube has $2^n$ vertices, therefore an $\aleph_0$-dimensional cube has $2^{\aleph_0}$ vertices, therefore $\aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}$. If the coordinates of point $x$ are treated as a big-endian bit-string representing a number (i.e. $d_1$ is the $2^0$ digit, $d_2$ is the $2^1$ digit etc.) then $x$ can be mapped to an integer. This integer can have an infinite number of digits. There are $\aleph_0$ integers. If there is a mapping between the reals and the integers then $\aleph_0 = 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$. This is obviously false, and is what I was trying to disprove. What part(s) of my proof is / are wrong?","['fake-proofs', 'elementary-set-theory']"

My questions are: 1) How does one find the upper and lower limits of the intergrals clearly one of the integrals should be z=4 and z=1 but how can one calculate the ones for x? 2) Do we need to calculate $\hat n$ and if so how? is it just $\frac{\nabla V}{|\nabla V|}=\hat n$ 3) What is the diagram supposed to look like because I'm finding it very hard to believe my diagram is correct? 4) Could someone show me the working for when evaluating the surface intergral specifically

My first (naive) approach, was to take the derivative of it and find all of the critical points. The problem with this approach is that all of the points on this function are critical points, which makes sense, because the majority of the time this function is zero. Some things that I have noticed are that if $m$ is a reduced fraction, such as $\frac{7}{15}$ and $r$ is a whole number such as $65536$, then some of the points where $f(x)$ is non-zero is when $x$ is a multiple of the denominator. With the numbers I have given, the first few points were this function is non-zero are 15, 30, and 45.  But not all of the non-zero points are at multiples of 15. What should be my next step in trying to find these points? Some things to note: $m$ is always going to be a fraction and
$r$ is always going to be a whole number.","['functions', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2172060,Peano existence theorem on manifolds,"Does the Peano existence theorem apply to continuous vector fields on smooth manifolds? For locally Lipschitz vector fields on smooth manifolds, the Picard-Lindelöf theorem can be applied in local charts to obtain local solutions, and then the uniqueness portion of this theorem guarantees that the local solutions agree where they overlap and thus can patch together to form global solutions. The Peano theorem guarantees only existence and not uniqueness. Thus I think there is no guarantee that local solutions agree where they overlap, and thus no guarantee that they can patch together to form global solutions. Is it possible to ""choose"" particular local solutions in charts so that they do agree where they overlap, and thus patch together to form global solutions? Edit: As John B pointed out with his answer, my original question wasn't worded very well since the Peano theorem is a local statement. Here is a modified question which captures the essence of what I want to know. Suppose we have a continuous vector field on a compact manifold. Is this vector field complete, in the sense that any integral curve has maximal interval of existence equal to all of $\mathbb{R}$?","['reference-request', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-topology']"
2172113,Rate at which $x$ changes with respect to $\theta$,"A ladder $10$ft long rests against a vertical wall. Let $\theta$ be the angle with the horizontal. The top of the ladder is $x$ feet above the ground. If the bottom of the ladder is pushed toward the wall, find the rate at which $x$ changes with respect to $\theta$ when $\theta=60$ degrees. Express the answer in units of feet per degree. So I start by illustrating an imagine of a ladder against a building to make a triangle where hypotenuse $=10$, $x$ is the vertical, and $\theta$ is the angle opposite the vertical. So,
$$\sin \theta=\frac{x}{10} \implies x=10\sin \theta$$
And we need to find the rate at which $x$ changes with respect to $\theta=60$ degrees,
$$x'=10\cos \theta \implies x'(\theta)=5$$ Question: Does this show that the rate at which $x$ changes with respect to $\theta=60$ degrees is equal to $5$? i.e For $\theta=60$ degrees, $\frac{dx}{d\theta}10\sin \theta=10\cos \theta=5$.

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x\sin 2x}{9+x^{2}} \, dx = \frac{-i}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{xe^{2ix}}{9+x^{2}}$$
Consider $f(z) = \frac{ze^{2iz}}{9+z^{2}}$ and the contour $\gamma$ of the semicircle laying in the upper half of the plane: Let $\gamma_{R}$ denote the circular part with radius $R$ and $\gamma_{L}$ denote the part lying on the real axis with length $2R$. Computing the residue at the only pole, $z = 3i$, we have that
$$\oint_{\gamma}f(z) \, dz = \frac{i\pi}{e^{6}} $$
On the other hand,
\begin{align*}
\oint_{\gamma}f(z) \, dz &= \oint_{\gamma_{R}}f(z) \, dz + \oint_{\gamma_{L}} f(z) \, dz \\
&= \oint_{\gamma_{R}} f(z) \, dz + \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{xe^{2ix}}{9+x^{2}} \, dx

It's fairly straight forward to find a union where either the $A_{i}$'s are countably infinite and $I$ is uncountably infinite or $I$ is countably infinite and the $A_{i}$'s are uncountably infinite. One idea I had to get them to be both uncountable was to break the real line up into intervals $[i, i+\Delta i)$ and take the limit as $\Delta i$ goes to zero. But I don't think this works because either $\Delta i$ is zero or it's greater than zero. If it's zero then $I$ is uncountable and $A$ only contains one real number, and is therefore countable. If $\Delta i$ is greater than zero, then it's possible to enumerate the intervals, so $I$ is countable. Another idea was to take the set of binary strings of infinite length and try to find a way to map each string to a uncountably infinite set of other binary strings of infinite length. I thought maybe this could be done by splitting up the strings into sets ($A_{i}$) depending on their first n digits, and then taking the limit as n goes to infinity. The problem with this is that if we give infinite digits then we've specified the string itself and the set $A_{i}$ can only contain one string. Otherwise the first n digits can be mapped to a natural number and so $I$ is countable. Same problem. Any help with this is appreciated. Thanks",['elementary-set-theory']
