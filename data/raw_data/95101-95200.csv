1304089,Differentiating both sides of an inequality with monotonic functions,"If $f(x)\le g(x)$ for all real $x$ for monotonic functions $f$ and $g$ (say, both increasing), does it follow that $f'(x)\le g'(x)$? (Note: I've seen several questions asking the same thing without the condition of monotonicity, but the counterexamples given always involve a non-monotonic function, and it seems to me that this condition might be sufficient; I haven't been able to come up with any counterexamples myself.)

1304119,A complemented lattice satisfying de Morgan's laws is an ortholattice?,"Suppose you have a bounded, complemented lattice $\mathfrak{L} = \left<L, \vee, \wedge, \neg, 1, 0\right>$ that satisfies De Morgan's laws. I want to prove that this is an ortholattice. The first condition $a \leq b \implies \neg b \leq \neg a$ was straightforward, but I am struggling a lot with the second condition. That is, given $\neg (a \vee b) = \neg a \wedge \neg b$ and $\neg (a \wedge b) = \neg a \vee \neg b$ for all $a, b \in L$, I'd like to show that $$\neg\neg a = a$$ for all $a, b, \in L$. When I looked this up in a textbook, what I saw was:
$\neg \neg a = \neg (\neg a \vee \neg a) = \neg \neg a \wedge \neg \neg a = a \wedge a = a $ I can't, however, understand how one gets $\neg \neg a \wedge \neg \neg a = a \wedge a$ without assuming $\neg\neg a = a$.

1304171,Does $\mu(x+B)= \mu(B)$ for all balls $B$ imply that $\mu$ equals the Lebesgue measure (up to scaling)?,"Suppose that $\mu$ is a measure on $(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ such that $\mu(K)<\infty$ for any compact set $K$ and $$\mu(x+B) = \mu(B) \tag{1}$$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and open balls $B$ . Does this imply that $\mu$ equals up to a constant the Lebesgue measure $\lambda^d$ , i.e. does it hold that $\mu = c \lambda^d$ for some constant $c \in [0,\infty]$ ? My attempts: It is well-known that if $(1)$ holds for all ( $d$ -dimensional) rectangles, then the claim holds true. So if we knew that any rectangle can be covered by disjoint balls, then we would be done. However, as far as I know, this is actually not possible. (See this question ) Define $$\mathcal{D} := \{A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d); \forall x: \mu(x+A) = \mu(A)\}$$ and show that $\mathcal{D}$ is a Dynkin system. If we knew this, then the fact that the balls are contained in $\mathcal{D}$ would imply $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ . My problem: Since $\mu$ is (in general) not a finite measure, I don't see how to prove the implication $A \in \mathcal{D} \implies A^c \in \mathcal{D}$ . I also considered defining $$\mathcal{D}_R := \{A \in \mathcal{B}(B(0,R)); \forall x: \mu(x+A) = \mu(A)\};$$ then it is easy to show that $\mathcal{D}_R$ is a Dynkin system, but, unfortunately, we cannot conclude that the balls are contained in $\mathcal{D}_R$ (since the intersection $B \cap B(0,R)$ is in general not a ball). Any ideas, counterexamples,...?

For every $s\geq0$, let $$\tau_s = \inf \left\{t \geq 0 \mid X_1(t) - x_1 > s \right\}\qquad Y_s = X_2(\tau_s)$$ The problem is to show that $Y=(Y_s)$ has the stationary, independence property. Here's what I've tried: Stationary: $Y_t - Y_s = X_2(\tau_t) - X_2(\tau_s) = X_2(\tau_t - \tau_s) = X_2(\tau_{t-s}) = Y_{t-s}$ This uses the fact that $\tau$ is stationary and the strong Markov property on $X_2$ Independence: Know $P(\tau_s < \infty) = 1$ for every $s$. By simple Markov property, I can reshift $X_2$ to a new process $\tilde{X}_2$ so that $\tilde{X}_2(0) = 0$. So by Strong Markov Property, $ E^{x_2}[Y_{\tau_s} \circ \theta_{\tau_s} | F_{\tau_s}] = E^{0}[Y_{\tau_s}] = 0$. But I get stuck at the independence part here since I'm not sure if I'm using the strong Markov property correctly. I want to essentially argue that because I know $X_2$ has the independent increment properties, that $Y$ should have it as well but I'm struggling to make it work.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'stationary-processes', 'stopping-times']"
1304361,multinomial hypothesis testing,"Suppose we have data $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ (I'll refer the categories as 1, 2, 3) that has a multinomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ and we want to test the hypothesis that $p_1>p_2>p_3$.  I am trying to figure out an exact testing procedure for this. One idea I had would be to first condition $X_3$ on $X_1$ i.e. see how many times 3 was realized when the options were 3 and 2 only.  According to the hypothesis, this should be less than 1/2 and we could construct a simple binomial test for this since $X_3|X_1$ has a binomial distribution with parameters $n-X_1$ and $\frac{p_3}{p_2+p_3}$ and reject if the realization of 3 exceeded some critical value $k$. Secondly, we could perform a similar test for $X_2|X_3$ and if the hypothesis is true we should see 2 chosen less than half the time when the options are only 1 or 2.  A similar binomial test would work for testing this.  Overall, we could reject the original hypothesis if either of these tests reject.
However, controlling size seems difficult to me in this case since the tests are not independent (at least they obviously seem to not be). Is there a better approach to testing this hypothesis?  I have considered confidence intervals for the $p$'s, but not sure if I should use two-side or one-sided.  I have seen procedures for confidence intervals for $p_i-p_j$ for $i\neq j$, but these rely on asymptotic approximations. Anyway, any help or suggestions or references would be greatly appreciated.","['hypothesis-testing', 'probability', 'statistics']"
1304368,Proving that every vector space has a norm.,"I am trying to prove that every vector space $X$ has a norm. I have some silly questions, but it's better to ask them now instead of later. I think I'm having a bit of trouble getting intuition about basis in infinite dimensional spaces. Fix a Hamel basis ${\cal B} = ({\bf e}_i)_{i \in I}$. Then for all ${\bf x} \in X$, we write: $${\bf x} = \sum_{i \in F}a_i{\bf e}_i,$$ for some $F \subset I$ finite. I understand that this combination is unique in the sense that: $$\sum_{i \in F_1}a_i{\bf e}_i = \sum_{i \in F_2}b_i{\bf e}_i,$$ for some $F_1,F_2 \subset I$ finite, implies that $a_i = b_i$ for all $i \in F_1 \cap F_2$ and $a_i = 0$ for all $i \in F_1 \setminus F_2$, and $b_i = 0$ for all $i \in F_2 \setminus F_1$. Does this mean that $F_1 = F_2$? Assuming that yes, although I'm not sure, the idea would be to define some kind of max norm, which would be well-defined: $$\|{\bf x}\| = \max\{|a_i| \mid i \in F  \}.$$ This idea seems good, it even showed up in another answer . The properties $\|{\bf x}\| \geq 0$ for all ${\bf x}\in X$, $\|{\bf x}\| = 0 \implies {\bf x}=0$ and $\|\lambda{\bf x}\| = |\lambda|\|{\bf x}\|$ are all clear. I'm having trouble getting the triangle inequality. How to make a sum here is a bit confuse to me. If ${\bf x},{\bf y}\in X$, then there are $F_1,F_2 \subset I$ finite such that: $${\bf x} = \sum_{i \in F_1}a_i{\bf e}_i, \quad \text{and}\quad {\bf y}=\sum_{i\in F_2}b_i{\bf e}_i,$$ so that $${\bf x}+{\bf y} = \sum_{i \in F_1 \setminus F_2}x_i{\bf e}_i + \sum_{i\in F_1 \cap F_2}(a_i+b_i){\bf e}_i + \sum_{i \in F_2 \setminus F_1}b_i{\bf e}_i.$$ I wanted to write this as $\sum_{i \in \text{ something}}c_i{\bf e}_i,$ but the only thing I could think of was: $$\sum_{i \in F_1 \cup F_2}c_i{\bf e}_i, \quad c_i = \begin{cases} a_i, \text{ if }i \in F_1 \setminus F_2 \\ a_i+b_i, \text{ if }i \in F_1 \cap F_2 \\ b_i, \text{ if }i \in F_2 \setminus F_1\end{cases}$$ But again: Is this combination unique in the sense that the only possible combination for the vector ${\bf x}+{\bf y}$ will be indexed by $F_1\cup F_2$? I think I am overcomplicating things. I can get the triangle inequality with this, it seems, but things don't look well-defined enough for me. Can someone address these questions and give me a small explanation about it? Thanks. Edit: to confirm what I understood from gerw's answer: since the combination is unique, if I write
$${\bf x}=âˆ‘_{iâˆˆF_1}a_i{\bf e}_i=âˆ‘_{iâˆˆF_2}b_i{\bf e}_i,$$
for $F_1,F_2âŠ‚I$, finite sets, then:

1304539,What are higher derivatives?,"From Wikipedia : Higher derivatives can also be defined for functions of several variables, studied in multivariable calculus. In this case, instead of repeatedly applying the derivative, one repeatedly applies partial derivatives with respect to different variables. For example, the second order partial derivatives of a scalar function of n variables can be organized into an n by n matrix, the Hessian matrix. One of the subtle points is that the higher derivatives are not intrinsically defined, and depend on the choice of the coordinates in a complicated fashion (in particular, the Hessian matrix of a function is not a tensor). Nevertheless, higher derivatives have important applications to analysis of local extrema of a function at its critical points. For an advanced application of this analysis to topology of manifolds, see Morse theory. In multivariable calculus, I was told that higher derivatives were tensors and that was the reason we never went beyond Hessians (none of us had studied tensors before).  If higher derivatives aren't tensors, then what are they?  Where can I learn more about them?","['multivariable-calculus', 'tensors', 'derivatives']"

Is this even possible? The direction of my own work on this problem has been looking for a trig function that alternates between two values when the limit is taken at infinity, and each successive derivative decreases the distance between the alternating values. After an infinite number of derivative operations, the distance between the alternating values would essentially be 0 and a limit at infinity would exist.

1304587,How many possible shuffles can be won perfectly?,"It is known that the possible shuffles of a deck of cards is $52!$, or ~$80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000$ different combinations. I have become aware of a game known as Idiot's Delight. The game is played in this manner: A deck is shuffled, and held in your left hand, face down. You begin pulling cards from the back of the deck, flipping them face up on top of the deck. You continue this process. When you have at least 4 cards, begin looking at the last 4 cards. If the first and last cards of the last four cards are the same suit, you may remove the two cards between them. If the first and last cards of the last four cards are the same value, you may remove all four cards. If the last four cards do not satisfy these conditions, continue drawing from the back of the deck, until you run out of face-down cards. Look at this example [Face Down Cards][$A$ â™ ][$2$ â™£][$3$ â™¦][$4$ â™ ] Here, the $2$â™£ and $3$â™¦ can be removed, and then play continues. You can win a game by correctly ""matching"" all the cards, or removing all cards from the face down section and containing no cards face up. This forces the last play to have the first and fourth card match in number. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that this game is possible to be won, albeit if difficult. Assuming it is possible to be won, how would I calculate how many potential shuffles out of $52!$ would be possible to be won, if the game is played perfectly, and how could I design a proof for this? Perfect play, for the sake of this question, encompasses not knowing the order of the deck, but making the decision to remove cards whenever there is a possibility of such.

My attempt: Let ${\cal P}^m$ be the set of all the polynomials in $\Bbb C[X]$ with $P(0)=1$. I am aware that $$\|P\| = \int_0^1 |P(t)|\,{\rm d}t$$ is continuous because it is a norm. Since ${\cal P}^m$ and $\Bbb R$ have finite dimension, and $T: {\cal P}^m \to \Bbb R$ given by $T(P) = P(0)$ is linear, $T$ is continuous, so: $$ \{ P \in {\cal P}^m \mid P(0) =  1 \} = T^{-1}(\{1\})$$ is a closed set. If I could show that it is bounded, we would have compactness (because of finite dimension) and I could conclude the result by Weierstrass' extremum theorem. But if you make $m=1$ and look at $T$ as a projection, it is clear that the set is not compact, so I don't think I am in the right way. Is there a way to save my work so far?

1304633,Solution to $y'=y^2-4$,"I recognize this as a separable differential equation and receive the expression: $\frac{dy}{y^2-4}=dx$ The issue comes about when evaluating the left hand side integral: $\frac{dy}{y^2-4}$ I attempt to do this integral through partial fraction decomposition using the following logic: $\frac{1}{(y+2)(y-2)} = \frac{A}{y+2}+\frac{B}{y-2}$ Therefore,
$1=Ay-2A+By+2B$. Since the coefficients must be the same on both sides of the equation it follows that: $0=A+B$    and $1=-2A+2B$.
Hence, $A=-B$, $B=\frac14$, $A=-\frac14$. Thus the differential equation should be transformed into: $-\frac{1}{4} \frac{dy}{y+2} + \frac14 \frac{dy}{y-2} = x+C$ Solving this should yield: $-\frac14 \ln|y+2| + \frac14 \ln|y-2| = x+C$ which simplifies as: $\ln(y-2)-\ln(y+2)=4(x+c)$ $\ln[(y-2)/(y+2)]=4(x+c)$ $(y-2)/(y+2)=\exp(4(x+c))$ $y-2=y*\exp(4(x+c)+2\exp(4(x+c))$ $y-y\exp(4(x+c))=2+2\exp(4(x+c))$ $y(1-\exp(4(x+c)))=2(1+\exp(4(x+c)))$ $y= 2(1+\exp(4(x+c)))/(1-\exp(4(x+c)))$ However, when done in Mathematica/Wolfram Alpha the result is given as (proof in the attached image) $\frac14 \ln(2-y) -\frac14 \ln(2+y) = x + C$ and returns an answer of: $y= 2(1-\exp(4(x+c)))/(1+\exp(4(x+c)))$.

1304672,Deriving the Quadratic Polynomials Defining the Twisted Cubic,"I've recently been reading about rational normal curves and how they may be represented and have come to the following question:  (for simplicity's sake, the problem is stated in terms of the RNC in $\mathbb{P}^3$, i.e., the twisted cubic) The twisted cubic is the image of the map
$$ v : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^3 $$
which sends $$[X_0 : X_1] \mapsto [X_0^3 : X_0^2 X_1 : X_0 X_1 ^2 : X_1 ^3]$$
In Harris' book on Algebraic Geometry it is stated that the twisted cubic is also the set of common zeros of the three homogeneous quadratic polynomials
$$ F_0 (Z) = Z_0 Z_2 - Z_1 ^2$$ 
$$F_1 (Z) = Z_0 Z_3 - Z_1 Z_2$$
$$ F_2 (Z) = Z_1 Z_3 - Z_2 ^2 $$ I have filled in the blanks as Harris (implicitly) suggests: that is, I have verified that any point on the twisted cubic is a point on each of the quadrics $F_i$ and that any common zero of the quadrics lies on the twisted cubic.  What continues to mystify me is the question: where do these quadratic polynomials come from? When they are given to me, I can certainly verify that they have the prescribed properties, but given the first description of the twisted cubic, how does one arrive at the quadrics defining it as a variety? Any guidance will be greatly appreciated! EDIT: I have found the quadrics simply by ""playing around:"" Denote by $C$ the twisted cubic in $\mathbb{P}^3$.  Let $P = [Z_0 : Z_1 : Z_2 : Z_3] \in C$ be any point.  Then we know that 
$$Z_0 = X_0^3, \ Z_1 = X_0^2 X_1, \ Z_2 = X_0 X_1^2, \ Z_3 = X_1 ^3 $$
Observing, for example, that 
$$(X_0 ^3)(X_1^3) - (X_0 ^2 X_1)(X_0 X_1^2) = 0 $$
Implies that 
$$ Z_0 Z_3 - Z_1 Z_2 = 0$$
and yields the quadratic polynomial $F_1 (Z)$.  The same sort of trick yields the other two polynomials $F_0 (Z)$ and $F_2 (Z)$. Now I've come to (perhaps) a more sophisticated set of questions: (1) How did we know to search for quadratic polynomials? (2) How did we know to search for three of them? I suppose we could proceed in a very ad hoc way: Well, it wasn't that bad to come up with the polynomial equations, and they happened to be quadratic (how fortuitous!)  Supposing I stopped after only finding two of the quadratics I could have manually checked ""are these enough to get all the points of the twisted cubic?""  If yes, great.  If no, search for more polynomials and repeat. Sure.  The above procedure would have worked just fine.  But what about when we try to generalize to the rational normal curve in $\mathbb{P}^n$?

In other words: if the derivative of a differentiable function is midpoint-linear, then it is linear. (In general, being midpoint-linear, i.e., $g((a+b)/2)=(g(a)+g(b))/2$ , is weaker ). I'm looking for a solution without Baire category tools, e.g., on the level of Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis . Motivation The problem isn't hard to solve if one uses the fact that $f'$ , being a Baire- $1$ function, has a point of continuity. Then the rest is elementary: here's a proof that a midpoint-linear function $g$ with a point of continuity is linear: Subtract a  linear function to arrange $g(0)=g(1)=0$ . Apply the midpoint-linear property to conclude that $g=0$ at all dyadic rationals. If $g$ is continuous at $a$ , then $g(a)=0$ by above. For every $\epsilon>0$ there is a neighborhood of $a$ in which $|g|<\epsilon$ . From midpoint-linearity, and $g$ being $0$ on a dense set, it follows that $|g|<\epsilon$ everywhere. Thus, $g\equiv 0$ . But invoking that fact about Baire- $1$ function looks like using a sledgehammer and makes me think I'm missing some approach here.","['real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

Consider the stopping rule that stops when $n$ is such that $|\overline{X_n}\ge Kn^{-1/2}|$, where $K$ is some fixed constant and $\overline X_n$ is the sample mean. It can be shown this stopping time is finite with probability 1. Then the likelihood function is proportional to a $N(\overline{X_n}, n^{-1/2})$ density. We also assume we have a prior that places half its mass at $0$, and half its mass on a normal distribution centered at zero with very large variance (so the distribution is mixed). Let us agree the wave our hands and say the normal distribution with very large variance can be approximated with an improper uniform prior over the real line. Recall that the likelihood principle says the stopping rule is irrelevant when making our Bayes's rule calculations. Treating $n$ as fixed in advance, Berger and Wolpert make the following claim about the posterior: $$\pi(0\,|\, \overline{X_n}=Kn^{-1/2})=[1+(1+n^2)^{-1/2}\exp[(K^2n)/(2(1+n))]]^{-1}.$$ I cannot figure out how this was derived.

Moreover, for each $z \in H$ and for each $w \in H$, we have 
$$\left( f_z + f_w \right) (x) = f_z(x) + f_w(x) = \langle x, z \rangle + \langle x, w \rangle = \langle x, z+w \rangle = f_{z+w}(x)$$ 
for all $x \in H$. So $f_{z+w} = f_z + f_w$. For $z \in H$ and for any scalar $\alpha$, we have 
$$f_{\alpha z} (x) = \langle x, \alpha z \rangle = \overline{\alpha} \langle x, z \rangle = \overline{\alpha} f_z (x) \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in H.$$
So, $f_{\alpha z} = \overline{\alpha } f_z$. Thus the mapping $z \mapsto f_z$ of $H$ into $H^\prime$ is surjective, isometric, and conjugate linear. Moreover, the set of all bounded linear functionals on any normed space is itself a normed space, rather a Banach space. But how to show that the inner product given by Kreyszig is the (only) natural one (i.e. that which fits into what we already know from the normed space theory)?","['inner-products', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'analysis']"
1304952,Derivation of the Exponential Nature of $e^x$,"Presumably, the transcendental number $e$ was first found by taking the power series solution to the (arguably most fundamental) differential equation $f'(x)=f(x)$, with the initial condition $f(0)=1$ and then plugging in $x=1$. My question is, is there any way, other than using the equivalent of the multinomial theorem for power series to demonstrate that $f(nx)=f^n(x)$ for all $n$ and $x$ (i.e., that $f(x)$ is an exponential function) other than this laborious and unaesthetic method?

1305001,Weak convergence of sequence of measures iff every subsequence in sequence of distribution functions contains an a.e. convergent subsequence,"I'm trying to prove the first part of Proposition 8.1.8 in V.I.Bogachev , Measure Theory 2 : A sequence of signed measures $\mu_n$ on the interval $[a,b]$ converges weakly to a measure $\mu$ precisely when $\sup_n\lvert|\mu_n|\rvert<\infty$ and every subsequence in the sequence of the distribution functions $F_{\mu_n}$ of the measures $\mu_n$ contains a further subsequence convergent to $F_\mu$ at all points, with the exception of points of an at most countable set. I'm struggling with the direction $\Leftarrow$ and already asked a question about this here , but I'm not sure if I did mention everything needed so let me cite the first few lines of the proof: Suppose that the measures $\mu_n$ are uniformly bounded and satisfy the indicated condition with subsequences, but do not converge weakly to $\mu$. Since every continuous function $f$ can be uniformly approximated by smooth functions, we obtain, taking into account the boundedness of $\lvert|\mu_n|\rvert$, that there exists a smooth function $f$ such that the integrals of $f$ against the measures $\mu_n$ do not converge to the integral of $f$ against $\mu$. Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the difference between the indicated integrals remains greater than some $\delta>0$. Passing to a subsequence once again we can assume that $\lim_{n\to\infty}F_{\mu_n}=F_\mu$ everywhere, with the exception of finiteley or countably many points. No problems for me so far. Please notice $F_{\mu_n}(t):=\mu_n([a,t))$. The functions $F_\mu$ and $F_{\mu_n}$ are constant on $(b,+\infty)$, hence $\mu([a,b])=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu_n([a,b])$. Then the integration by parts formula yields that the right-hand side of the equality
  $$\int_a^bf(t)\mu_n(dt)=f(b)F_{\mu_n}(b+)-\int_a^bf'(t)F_{\mu_n}(t)dt$$ converges to
  $$ f(b)F_{\mu}(b+)-\int_a^bf'(t)F_{\mu}(t)dt=\int_a^bf(t)\mu(dt)$$
  which leads to a contradiction. My problem here is I don't see why the last integral in the first line converges to the first integral in the second line. I don't see any possibility to apply monotone or dominated convergence, so I have no idea what to do. Any help would be highly appreciated, I'm really stuck here.

I came across with the following lemma: Lemma 1: If $p$ is a prime number and $A,B$
   are subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $\varnothing\neq A\neq \mathbb{Z}_p
 $ and $\left |B\right | =2$, then $\left |A+B \right | \geq\left
 |A\right |+1  $, where $ A+B=\{a+b: a \in A, b \in B \} $. Proof: Without loss of generality $B=\{ 0,\beta\}$, where $\beta \neq 0$ and then $A\subseteq A+B$. Let us assume by contradiction that $A+B=A$. Let $a\in A$. Therefore $a+\beta\in A+B$, and thus $a+\beta\in A$. By this manner we can deduce that $a+k\beta\in A$ for every $k$ and from here that $$\mathbb{Z}_p=\{a,a+\beta, a+2\beta,\dots , a+(p-1)\beta\}\subseteq A $$ But we assume $A\neq \mathbb{Z}_p$.â–  Question 1: How we deduce that  $\left |A+B \right | \geq\left |A\right |+1$ by such contradiction? Here I decided to prove this lemma by my own, and I came up with some more general result: Lemma 2: If $p$ is a prime number and $A,B$ are subsets of
   $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $\varnothing\neq A,B$, then $\left |A+B \right |
 \geq\left |A\right |+\left |B\right | -1 $ Proof: Since the set of integer numbers is ordered set, we can translate $A$ and $B$ to new sets $A'$ and $B'$, so that $\sup(A')=0$ and $\inf(B')=0$ and still preserve the cardinalities of these two sets, thus $\left |A\right|=\left |A'\right |$ and $\left |B\right|=\left |B'\right |$. Now, since $0\in A',B'$ we can deduce that $A\cup B\subseteq A+B$. Small observation about the nature of $A'$ and $B'$ revivals that $\left |A\cup B\right|=\left |A\right|+\left |B\right|-1$. Combining the last result with $\left |A\cup B\right|\leq\left |A+B\right |$ we get the desired result. â–  Now, returning to text where lemma 1 is used, Proof(EGZ for primes): Without loss of generality let $$(1) \ \  \ \ \ \ \      0\leq a_1\leq a_2\leq\dots \leq a_{2p-1}<p$$ If $a_i=a_{i+p-1}$ for certain $1\leq i\leq p$, then $$\sum^{i+p-1}_{j=i}=pa_i$$ And that is what we looked for. Now suppose that $a_i\neq a_{i+p-1}$ for all $1\leq i\leq p$, then we define $A_1=\{ a_1\}$ and $A_i=\{a_i,a_{i+p-1}\}$for $1\leq i\leq p $, then by repeating the lemma above one can conclude that in $\mathbb{Z}_p$: $$\left|A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_p \right|=p$$ Thus, every element in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the sum of exact $p$ terms of our ordered set, and that the sum of $p$ elements of that set divisible by $p$. 
â–  Question 2: How really one can deduce $\left|A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_p \right|=p$ from the lemma, and how can one conclude that every element in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the sum of exact $p$ terms of our ordered set, and that the sum of $p$ elements of that set divisible by $p$? Searching for more information, I came up with Noga Alon and Moshe Duniner article , which proved EGZ theorem in five different ways. The first proof that they begin with is the related one. They states the Cauchy-Davenport theorem: Cauchy-Davenport theorem: If $p$ is a prime number and $A,B$ are two nonempty subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, then $\left | A+B  \right|\geq \min\{p,\left|A  \right|+ \left | B \right |-1 \}$ And proving in the same matter the prime case of EGZ.

Here's a proof for this identity: Let $\rho \in S_n$ be such that $\rho (a_i) = \rho(a_{i+1 \text{ (mod } r)})$, in other words $\rho = (\sigma(a_1) \sigma(a_2) \dots \sigma(a_r))$.

I can't even prove that T is a bounded operator. Any hints on how could I go about solving this ?

1305386,Why do all parabolas have an axis of symmetry?,"And if that's just part of the definition of a parabola, I guess my question becomes why is the graph of any quadratic a parabola? My attempt at explaining : The way I understand it after some thought is that any quadratic can be written by completing the square as a perfect square + a constant, for ex: $f(x) = x^2 + x$ can be written as $f(x) = (x+\frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4}$. So essentially, any quadratic is a displaced version of $f(x) = x^2$, and it's pretty obvious why $f(x) = x^2$ has an axis of symmetry and why it's at the vertex. Is my reasoning correct? And if you have a different way to think about it and explain it, whether geometric, algebraic or other, I would love to see it.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"

1305427,limit of a function involving infinite nested roots,"I was given the following problem :

$ \sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+...}}<x$ that is  $ \frac{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+...}}}{x}  = \frac{1}{x^y} : y>0 $ hence  $\lim \limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+...}}}{x} =0$ I concluded that the original limit equals $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{1+0}} = 1$ Was my reasoning correct?

1305466,Commutative property of matrix multiplication (or lack thereof),"Assuming $A$ and $B$ are invertible matrices and are of proper dimensions to be multiplied (say, $2\times2$), is the following expression correct for all examples of matrices $A$ and $B$? $$(A^{-1}B)(AB^{-1}) = A^{-1}BAB^{-1} = A^{-1}AB^{-1}B = I^2 = I$$ My understanding is that for matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ doesn't necessarily equal $BA$ as matrix multiplication is not commutative. I'm trying to simplify the below expression: $$(AB)^{-1}(AC^{-1})(D^{-1}C^{-1})^{-1}D^{-1}$$ Nothing is given about the matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ beyond that they are invertible and of correct dimensions such that any matrix multiplication is possible. My process is as below: $$\begin{align}(AB)^{-1}(AC^{-1})(D^{-1}C^{-1})^{-1}D^{-1} &= (A^{-1}B^{-1})(AC^{-1})(DC)D^{-1}\\
&= A^{-1}B^{-1}AC^{-1}DCD^{-1}\\
&= B^{-1}A^{-1}AC^{-1}CDD^{-1}\\
&= B^{-1}I^3\\
&= B^{-1}\end{align}$$ You'll notice the error I've made here: $(AB)^{-1} = (B^{-1}A^{-1})$, not $(A^{-1}B^{-1})$, but in the end it doesn't change the answer. The answer in the textbook is indeed $B^{-1}$. According to the above: $$(B^{-1}A^{-1}) = (A^{-1}B^{-1})$$ But matrices are not commutative?

1305494,Invertible matrix over a ring and its eigenvalues,"Eigenvalues and invertible matrices for fields and vector spaces: Let $K$ be a field (so $K^n$ is a $K$-vector space) and let $A \in K^{n\times n}$ be an $n\times n$-matrix. Then we have the following definition and theorem: Definition: An element $\lambda\in K$ is called an eigenvalue of $A$ iff there is a $v\in K^n\setminus\{0\}$ such that $Av=\lambda v$. Theorem: The matrix $A$ is invertible iff all of its eigenvalues are invertible (i. e. 0 isn't an eigenvalue). ""Eigenvalues"" and invertible matrices for rings and modules: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with a multiplicative identity (so $R^n$ is an $R$-module) and let $B\in R^{n\times n}$ be an $n\times n$-matrix. Then let's define what an eigenvalue of $B$ is: Definition: An element $\mu\in R$ is called an eigenvalue of $B$ iff there is a $v\in R^n\setminus\{0\}$ such that $Bv=\mu v$. Clearly, it is possible for an $R^{n\times n}$-matrix to have only invertible eigenvalues and not to be invertible itself. Take for example $\begin{pmatrix}
3 & -13 \\
1 & -3\end{pmatrix}\in \mathbb{Z}^{2\times 2}$. All of its eigenvalues are invertible (simply because it doesn't have any eigenvalues in $\mathbb{Z}$); however the matrix is not invertible (because its determinant is 4 which is not a unit in $\mathbb{Z}$). So the following is for sure false: Not a theorem! The matrix $B$ is invertible if all of its eigenvalues are invertible (i. e. are units in $R$). Now, I wonder if the following is true: Theorem? If the matrix $B$ is invertible , then all of its eigenvalues are invertible (i. e. are units in $R$). If it is true, how can it be proved? If it is false, what would be a counter-example?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'inverse', 'linear-algebra', 'modules']"
