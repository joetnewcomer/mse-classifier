173760,Computing a sum of binomial coefficients: $\sum_{i=0}^m \binom{N-i}{m-i}$,"Does anyone know a better expression than the current one for this sum? $$
\sum_{i=0}^m \binom{N-i}{m-i}, \quad 0 \le m \le N.
$$ It would help me compute a lot of things and make equations a lot cleaner in the context where it appears (as some asymptotic expression of the coefficients of a polynomial defined over cyclic graphs). Perhaps the context doesn't help much though. For instance, if $N = m$, the sum is $N+1$, and for $N = m+1$, this sum is $N + (N-1) + \dots + 1 = N(N+1)/2$. But otherwise I don't know how to compute it.","['graph-theory', 'summation', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
173774,How can I bound this equation?,"This is a problem I stuck in Berkeley Problems in Mathematics, fall 1983: Let $x(t)=(x_{1}(t)...x_{n}(t))$ be a differentiable function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. It satisfies a differential equation of the form $$x'(t)=f(x(t))$$ where $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. Assuming that $f$ satisfies the condition $$\langle f(y),y\rangle\le |y|^{2}$$ derive an inequality showing that $|x(t)|$ grows at most exponentially. I am thinking about decompoising $f(y)$ into $y^{T}$ and $y$ directions, but this does not allow me to integrate $x'(t)$ from $t_{0}$ to $t$. If I can show $|f(y)|\le K|y|$ then the inequality would be immediate; but this is false as $f(y)$ can be orthogonal to $y$ at every point $y=x(t)$ and have arbitrarily large norm. So I do not know how to solve this in an elegant way. I can solve it in the most radical case that $x'(t)\cdot x(t)=0\forall t$ and $x'(t)=K(t)x(t)$, but I do not know how to deal with arbitrarily curves.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
173775,Positivity of the norm of an element of a cyclotomic field,"Let $l$ be an odd prime number and $\zeta$ be an $l$-th primitive root of unity in $\mathbb{C}$.
Let $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ be the cyclotomic field and $\alpha$ be a non-zero element of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$. There exists a polynomial $f(X) \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$ such that $\alpha = f(\zeta)$. Let $N(\alpha) = f(\zeta)f(\zeta^2)...f(\zeta^{l-1})$. From $\bar\zeta = \zeta^{-1}$ it follows that $\bar f(\zeta) = f(\zeta^{-1})$.
Likewise, $\bar f(\zeta^i) = f(\zeta^{-i})$ for $i = 1,2,\cdots,l - 1$. 
Since $f(\zeta^i)\bar f(\zeta^i) = |f(\zeta^i)|^2 > 0$, it follows that
$N(\alpha) > 0$. We used the fact that the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ has an $l$-th primitive root of unity. It seems to me that this fact can only be proved by using some (elementary) analysis. My question is: Can we prove $N(\alpha) > 0$ purely algebraically? In other words, can we prove $N(\alpha) > 0$ without using the field of real numbers? Please note that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta) \cong \mathbb{Q}[X]/(1 + X + ... + X^{l-1})$ can be constructed purely algebraically from $\mathbb{Q}$.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

I can do the $\Leftarrow$ direction: assuming $\gamma_2$ is continuous, the map $(g,x)\mapsto (\phi_g,x)$ is continuous.  Since the evaluation map $(\phi_g,x)\mapsto \phi_g(x)$ is continuous, and $\gamma_1$ is the composition of these two, $\gamma_2$ is continuous. The other direction is where I'm not sure how to proceed.  We can take $\phi_g\in H(X)$ and a subbasis set $S(C,U)=\{f:f(C)\subseteq U\}$ for $C$ compact, $U$ open, such that $\phi_g\in S(C,U)$.

where $R$ is the ramification divisor of $f$.
The proof of this was given to me as an exercise when I started my PhD, and I am very happy with it. However, in some other work that I was doing it appeared that one could strengthen this to say rather that if $K_X={\rm div}(f^*(dx))$ and $K_Y={\rm div}(dx)$ are canonical divisors of $X$ and $Y$, then 
$$
K_X = n\cdot K_Y + R.

I have found this alluded to in a number of places, and even stated in Algebraic Curves Over Finite Fields by Carlos Moreno. However, this was without proof, and every idea of a proof that I have seen is in sheaf theoretic language. I am slowly getting through sheaves and schemes, but I am currently trying to prove this in an elementary manner (fiddling around with orders of $dx$ etc.), in the wildly ramified case (the tamely ramified case is fine). I would like to know if It is possible to prove this without using sheaves etc in the wildly ramified case If so, are there any references that would help with this. edit: Also, is there a different name for the ""more specific"" Hurwitz formula?","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-curves']"

Numerically, it is approx. $1.282427\ldots$ I began by writing zeta as a sum and switching the summation order $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(k+2)n^{2k+1}}$$ The first sum is the series for $-n^3\ln(1-\frac{1}{n^2})-n-\frac{1}{2n}$ So, we have $-\sum_{n=2}^\infty \left[\ln(1-\frac{1}{n^2})+n+\frac{1}{2n}\right]$ This series numerically checks out, so I am onto something. At first glance the series looks like it should diverge, but it does converge. Another idea I had was to write out the series of the series: $$1/3(1/2)^{3}+1/4(1/2)^{5}+1/5(1/2)^{7}+\cdots
+1/3(1/3)^{3}+1/4(1/3)^{5}+1/5(1/3)^{7}+\cdots +1/3(1/4)^{3}+1/4(1/4)^{5}+1/5(1/4)^{7}+\cdots$$ and so on. This can be written as
$$1/3x^{3}+1/4x^{5}+1/5x^{7}+\cdots +1/3x^{3}+1/4x^{5}+1/5x^{7}+\cdots + 1/3x^{3}+1/4x^{5}+1/5x^{7}+\cdots $$ where $x=1/2,1/3,1/4,\ldots$ This leads to the series representation for: $$\frac{-\ln(1-x^2)}{x^3}-\frac{1}{x}-\frac{x}{2}$$ Since $x$ is of the form $1/n$, we end up with the same series as before. Now, my quandary. How to finish?.  Where in the world does that Glaisher-Kinkelin constant come in, and how can that nice closed from be obtained?. Whether from the series I have above or some other means. As usual, it is probably something I should be seeing but don't at the moment.

I want to show $\lambda([a,b])= b-a$ The proof of the book that I am using starts with the following: Let $\epsilon >0$. Because $$[a,b] \subset \left(a- \frac{\epsilon}{4}, b+ \frac{\epsilon}{4}\right) \cup \bigcup_{n=2}^\infty \left(- \frac{\epsilon}{2 \cdot 2^n},\frac{\epsilon}{2 \cdot 2^n}\right)$$, we obtain $\lambda([a,b]) < b-a +\epsilon$ which implies $\lambda([a,b])\le b-a$.

(My guessing is that you add the countable union so that it coincides with the definition of Lebesgue outer measure) In addition, I do not know how can we arrive at the inequality $\lambda([a,b]) < b-a +\epsilon$. I do know that $b-a + \epsilon$ is essentially the length of $(a- \frac{\epsilon}{4}, b+ \frac{\epsilon}{4}) \cup \bigcup_{n=2}^{\infty} (- \frac{\epsilon}{2 \cdot 2^n},\frac{\epsilon}{2 \cdot 2^n})$ since I already computed it out.

174585,Quotient of a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module,"I'm trying to find the quotient of a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module, but somehow I don't really find the right procedure on how to get the right quotient (nor have I found any sources). I've read What does it mean here to describe the structure of this quotient module? already, but I didn't manage to reproduce the second matrix from that specific post.
In my specific example I have $\mathbb{Z}^3$ as a left-$\mathbb{Z}$ module. Lets call the generators $e_1, e_2, e_3$. My submodule is given by $$K:=\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Z}}\left<i_1:=\left(\matrix{0\\-2\\1}\right), i_2:=\left(\matrix{-2\\0\\1}\right)\right>$$ My idea to get the quotient module $\mathbb{Z}^3/K$ thus far was to use the equalities $$i_1 = -2e_2+e_3\\
i_2 = -2e_1+e_3
$$ Which yields (for $z_1,z_2,z_3,l_1,l_2\in\mathbb{Z}$): $$ z_1e_1+z_2e_2+z_3e_3 \equiv z_1e_1+z_2e_2+z_3e_3+l_1i_1+l_2i_2\\
 = z_1e_1+z_2e_2+z_3e_3+l_1(-2e_2+e_3)+l_2(-2e_1+e_3)\\
 = (z_1-2l_1)e_1 + (z_2-2l_2)e_2 + (z_3+l_1+l_2)e_3$$ So for $z_1$ even, the first summand should be identical to zero. For $z_1$ uneven it should be identical to one. Same goes for $z_2$ and the second summand, whereas the third summand should be identical to zero in any case (though i'm not really sure about how to deal with that one, since I've already fixed $l_1$ and $l_2$). Hence I'd say my quotient should be $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$. However, letting sage do the calculations, it claims that the result should be $\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2$ So my question is: Is my result wrong? If so: Where's my mistake and is there a better way to do it?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra']"

174740,Elementary Geometry Nomenclature: why so bad?,"A long-ish wall of text, and I apologize. Some background: when I was a first-year university student, my chemistry professor was lecturing and was trying to find the word to describe a shape. A student piped up and said, ""that's a rhombus."" The professor stopped mid-stride, looked at him squarely, and said, ""rhombus? That's a stupid word. What's a rhombus? I don't even think that's a word. The word I was thinking of was 'parallelogram'."" This was shocking, because this was an American professor, at an American university, and in my American public education, I was taught what a rhombus was in the second or third grade. Recently, however, I was thinking that maybe my professor wasn't wrong. Consider the naming system for quadrilaterals. The term ""quadrilateral"" makes some sense: ""quad"" from Latin for ""four"", and ""lateral"" meaning side. And then you get parallelogram, with ""parallel"" meaning ""parallel"" and ""gram"" from Greek meaning ""drawn"". But then a rectangle is a special case of a parallelogram where the angles are all right angles, which follows clearly enough, and a square is a special case of a rectangle, and important enough to merit its own term. But then a quadrilateral with only two parallel sides is a trapezoid, which derives from Greek for ""table shaped"". And then a rhombus is the complement to the square in the special cases of parallelograms -- its angles are anything but right angles! Confusing yet? We've got the following suffixes describing shapes: -lateral, -gram, -zoid. We also have triangles, which makes sense because it's ""three angles."" Yet a ""quadrangle"" is a region in a university campus. Increasing the number of sides in the shape, we go from ""quadrilaterals"" to ""pentagons"". Ok, now we've gone from the Latin prefix for ""four"" and a suffix meaning ""side"" to the Greek for ""five"" and a totally different suffix. Sometimes we describe the word using a root that means ""drawn"", and sometimes we describe it by the way that it looks. And still ""rhombus"" fits in nowhere in this crazy, convoluted scheme! To bring this all back to mathematics, and to ask my original question: Individually, I can find the etymology of each of these terms. But why did the mathematics community adhere to these terms, particularly in elementary education? Did these terms get translated haphazardly from Elements ? Is this one of those consequences of the somewhat insular nature of the mathematical community during the Renaissance era? The mathematics community has evolved to be fairly precise in its use of terminology. Why is the terminology surrounding elementary geometry so fragmented?","['geometry', 'education', 'terminology', 'soft-question']"
