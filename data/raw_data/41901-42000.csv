414284,rms signal given covariance matrix,"Hi I have a fairly simple question Say I have a covariance matrix C that describes the noise in some data series D, including correlations between different data points (so just a general correlated gaussian). I thought that if i wanted to work out the theoretical RMS of the signal such a matrix describes i could just use the square root of the diagonal elements, however, if i generate 100000 realisations of noise described by my covariance matrix by taking the cholesky decomposition and using that to generate my data series, i get an rms of 1.23508e-07 however the square root of all the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are 2.12019e-07 and i don't understand where the offset is coming from. How should i go about getting the theoretical rms from the covariance matrix? Cheers",['statistics']

414309,"For subspaces, if $N\subseteq M_1\cup\cdots\cup M_k$, then $N\subseteq M_i$ for some $i$?","I have a vector space $V$ over a field of characteristic $0$. If $M_1,\dots,M_k$ are proper subspaces of $V$, and $N$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $N\subseteq M_1\cup\cdots\cup M_k$, how can you tell $N\subseteq M_i$ for some $i$? I was first trying to show it just in the case $N\subseteq M_1\cup M_2$, and hoping to extend it to finitely many $M_i$. If either of the $M_i$ contains the other, the claim follows, so I suppose neither $M_i$ contains the other. In hopes of a contradiction, I suppose $N\not\subseteq M_1$ and $N\not\subseteq M_2$, Picking $x_1\in N\setminus M_1$ and $x_2\in N\setminus M_2$, I'd have $x_1+x_2\in N\subseteq M_1\cup M_2$. The only thing I could conclude was that actually $x_1,x_2\notin M_1$ and $x_1,x_2\notin M_2$, which seems like a dead end. What's the right way to do this?","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

414318,Confusion about the usage of points vs. vectors,"As far as definitions go, understand the difference between a vector and a point. A vector can be translated and still be the same vector, whereas a point is fixed. But I would like some clarification on the usage of vectors and the usage of points, because it seems like in many cases they are used interchangeably. For example: It has always been my understanding that addition is not defined for
two points. But in this question , two points are being added
together in this equation: $\overline{C}= \lbrace tx+(1-t)x': x\in C, x' \in C', t\in [0,1]\rbrace$ Sometimes $\mathbb{R}^n$ is used to denote the set of $n$ dimensional vectors, and sometimes it denotes the set of points in $n$ dimensional space. In vector calculus, it is often said that a function with multiple inputs takes a vector as an input, but I have rarely seen a function written as $f(\vec{v})$. Even though I understand that what it means to say is, the vector that originates at the origin, to me, it doesn't seem entirely correct to say that the input is a vector without explicitly saying that the vector's tail is at the origin. Can anyone clarify these points of confusion? Are point and vector interchangeable in these cases? Also, is there a notation for ""converting"" one to the other? E.g. how to ""convert"" $\langle{x,y,z}\rangle$ to $(x,y,z)$ or vice versa?","['notation', 'geometry', 'definition']"

414350,Showing a compact metric space has a countable dense subset,"I know that this is separable, but that has not been covered by the text at this point. I believe my proof (below) to be correct, but not very rigorous. Assuming that it actually is correct, could someone please help me make it more formal? (If it's not correct, please help with the proof). Thanks. Proof : Let $X$ be a compact metric space. Let $B_n = \{B(x,\frac1{n}) : x\in X\}$. be the collection of open balls centered at $x$. Let $\{x\}^{(n)}$ be the set of centers for some particular $n$. Then by compactness of $X$, there are also a finite number of centers for a particular $n$ (corresponding to each open ball). [This is where I have trouble properly saying what's on my mind:] Consider $B(x,r_0)$, where $r_0 = \frac{1}{n_0}$. When we decrease the magnitude of $r_0$ to $r_1$, we must still be able to cover $X$. Meaning some open ball(s) must be ""formed"" where $B(x,r_0)$ was once ""covering"". So by adding open balls, we also add to our collection of centers. This means at $B(x,r_0)$, there was originally a point $y \in B(x,r_0)$ s.t. $B(y,r') \subset B(x,r_0)$ for some $r'$. That is, $B(x,r_0)$ contained another point of $X$. Thus, by definition, $X$ contains a countable dense subset.","['solution-verification', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

So I got 2 topological space $X$ and $Y$ with their first fundamental group being $G=\pi_{1}(X)$ and $H=\pi_{1}(Y)$. Additionally, there exist a continuous function from $X$ onto $Y$ and a continuous function from $Y$ onto $X$ (they are not necessary inverse of each other, and whether they are one-to-one is not known). These induce a homomorphism from $G$ into $H$ and a homomorphism from $H$ into $G$ (not known whether they are onto or not, or one-to-one or not). So my questions are, given that, can you conclude: That $G\cong H$? If not, what is a counterexample? That $X\cong Y$? If not, what is a counterexample?

414419,"Prove that if $a b c=1$, $a^2+b^2+c^2\ge 3$. (for $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$)","I can do this problem using calculus minimization techniques, using Lagrange multipliers to find the equations $a^2=b^2=c^2$, so with $abc=1$, $a$, $b$, and $c$, are either $-1$ or $1$ (making sure you don't end up with $abc$ negative). So if the minimum distances are at those points, then $a^2+b^2+c^2=3$ is the closest distance, so all other solutions are further away. I just pieced together (while writing this) that there's another solution: The arithmetic-geometric inequality gives $3(abc)^{1/3}\le a+b+c$, and by the inequality of this question , we have $9(abc)^{2/3}\le (a+b+c)^2\le 3(a^2+b^2+c^2)$, so since $abc=1$, we have $3\le a^2+b^2+c^2$.

414446,Why do we use the inverse conversion formula to convert slope per radians to slope per degrees,"This is a contribution question I'm making in hopes that others may benefit. I will provide my answer underneath. Initially I wanted to ask this question, but I solved it myself and I'd like to give back for the question I asked earlier. I will wait a day before selecting an answer in case anyone else wants a crack at it. I asked a question earlier here about why I was getting a different answer when calculating the tangent slope of a line by using the secant method compared to using the Calculus method. I found out that the Calculus method always produces an answer relative to radian measure. So the two answers I had were actually the same, except one was slope per radians and one was slope per degrees. Why is it that when we convert radians to degrees we multiply radians $\ *\frac{180}{\pi}\ $, but when we convert slope per radians to slope per degrees we have to multiply the inverse conversion formula slope per radians $\ *\frac{\pi}{180}\ $? I should give an example to explain better. Given r radians, we get degrees by $\ r * \frac{180}{\pi}\ $
Given d degrees, we get radians by $\ d * \frac{\pi}{180}\ $ However, the opposite is true when converting slope per radians and slope per degrees: Given s slope per radians, we get slope per degrees by $\ s * \frac{\pi}{180}\ $
Given t slope per degrees, we get slope per radians by $\ t * \frac{180}{\pi}\ $ It seems illogical that we convert slope per radians to slope per degrees by using the formula which converts degrees to radians. Since it's already in radian form?","['trigonometry', 'graphing-functions']"
414449,Question on $\mbox{Ext}^1$,"I have 2 questions, one of them concerning the isomorphicity of quotient groups (rings), and the other is on $\mbox{Ext}^1$ . It's pretty long, but somehow related to each other. So I just kinda put everything here, instead of dividing it into different posts. Question 1 I know that given $A; B$ subgroups of an Abelian group $G$ , then if $A \cong B$ , then it's not necessarily true that $R/A \cong R/B$ (I can find a counter example of this). But is the reverse true? Like if $R/A \cong R/B$ then is true that $A \cong B$ ? I think that it's false, but I cannot find a counter example of it. :( And moreover, how can I find counter examples of the above 2 statements in quotient rings? I've been searching for a counter example in common rings, like $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Z}[x]$ but with no luck. Question 2 So basically, I understand that, if you are trying to prove something of the line $X/X' \cong Y/Y'$ , then showing that $X\cong X'$ , and $Y \cong Y'$ is definitely not enough. Ok, here's my second question. Given a ses of $R-$ modules $0 \to M \xrightarrow{f} P \xrightarrow{g} X \to 0$ , where $P$ is projective, and an $R-$ module $Y$ . Here's a proof of $\mbox{Ext}^1 (X;Y) \cong \mbox{Hom}(M;Y)/\mbox{Im}(\mbox{Hom}(f;1_Y))$ , that I don't really understand. Firstly, construct a projective solution for $M$ , i.e: $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{\delta_0} M \to 0$$ Then, we can connect the above les with the ses as given to arrive at a projective resolution for $X$ as follow. $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{f\delta_0} P \xrightarrow{g} X \to 0$$ Now, drop the $X$ to obtain the following complex: $$... \xrightarrow{\delta_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{f\delta_0} P \to 0$$ Apply $\mbox{Hom}(-; Y)$ to the above complex to have yet another complex: $$... \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_2; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_1; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_0; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(f\delta_0; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P; Y) \leftarrow 0$$ Now by definition, we have: $\mbox{Ext}^1(X;Y) = \mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) / \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y)$ (*) Now, we'll try to express $\mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)$ in other terms. Since $P_1 \xrightarrow{\delta_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{\delta_0} M \to 0$ is exact, apply $\mbox{Hom} (-; Y)$ to this sequence, to have an exact sequence: $\mbox{Hom}(P_1; Y)\xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(P_0; Y) \xleftarrow{\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)} \mbox{Hom}(M; Y) \leftarrow 0$ , which means that: $\mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) = \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y) \cong \mbox{Hom} (M; Y)$ (since $\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)$ is injective). And $\mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y) = \mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)\left( \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)(\mbox{Hom}(P; Y))\right) \cong \mbox{Im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)$ (since $\mbox{Hom}(\delta_0; 1_Y)$ is injective). And then, the author just kind of plug everything in (*) , to have: $$\mbox{Ext}^1(X;Y) = \mbox{ker} \ \mbox{Hom}(\delta_1; 1_Y) / \mbox{im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f \delta_0; 1_Y) \cong \mbox{Hom} (M; Y) / \mbox{Im} \ \mbox{Hom}(f; 1_Y)$$ This proof doesn't look good to me, since AFAIK we cannot prove isormorphicity of quotient modules like that.

414596,"Thin Plate Spline interpolation of scattered $z(x,y)$ data","I am trying to understand Thin Plate Spline interpolation of scattered data.
As I understand it TPS is just a special case of Radial Basis Function interpolation: $$ z(x,y) = p(x,y) + \sum_i l_i\phi(r)$$
where p(x,y) is a polynomial and $\ \phi $ is a RBF. In the case of TPS: $\ \phi = r^2\ln(r) $ Should not the RBF decrease with r? In the case of inverse distance weighted interpolation the weight of each point goes from +infinity at r = 0 to 0 at r = + infinity. Which order of polynomial should I use? I understand that p(x,y) should compensate for offset and maybe a linear trend,
so that would indicate: p(x,y) = ax+by+c. But why stop there? The TPS is required to go exactly trough each point:
$$ z_i = p(x_i,y_i) + \sum_j l_j\phi(r_i) $$ This can be written as a matrix equation:
$$ [\Phi, X, Y, 1]*[L, a, b, c]'=Z$$
where $\ \Phi $ is a nxn matrix, X, Y, L and Z are nx1 vectors. This is underdetermined: there are n + 3 unknowns and n equations.
Therefore one have to impose some additional requirements.
One requires:
$$ \sum_i x_i*l_i = 0$$
$$ \sum_i y_i*l_i = 0$$
$$ \sum_i 1*l_i = 0$$
and calls this orthogonality. But what does this mean? I am used to orthogonal function expansions and understand that $\ <x,b(x,y)> = 0$
for some basis function,b, would mean that x and b(x,y) are orthogonal and that would be a good thing since it makes it easy to find the coefficients of b by simply taking the inner product of b and the function to be expanded. But in this context? And why is the coefficents of the RBFs that are in the orthogonality requirement and not the RBFs themselves? However this means that we now have n equations for n unknows.
Introducing $\ P=[X,Y,1] $ and $\ C = [a,b,c]' $ our first matrix equation can be written as:
$$ [\Phi | P][L|C]'=Z $$
and the orthogonality requirements becomes a vertical concatenation to this:
$$ [P' | 0]*[L | C]' = 0 $$ Which method would you recommend to solve this equation? Which functions does this correspond to in Lapack? If the number of samples, n, is large this computation becomes heavy. Is there some easy and sensible way to improve upon this? I was considering introducing a cut-off radius and any points further away than this would get the $\ \phi $ = 0 value. This would lead to a sparse matrix equation. However this stumbles on my first question: why does not the RBF decay to 0 as r goes to infinity?","['interpolation', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"

414649,Understanding examples of subfield and prime subfield of a finite field,"I have already taken a look at this answer . Somehow it did not answer my question. As I can find, in various literatures, A lecture note, Definition 4.1 :
Let
$F$
be a field. A subset

$F$
is called a
subfield
of
$F$. Another lecture note, Section 7.4.2 : A subfield $G$ of a field $F$ is a subset of the field that is itself a field under the operations of $F$. Now, if we consider the operations of the field to be  $+ \bmod n$ and $\times \bmod n$. We find that $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_5$ are both fields under these operations. But in order to get a good feeling of subfields, we try to  consider $\mathbb{Z}_{3^2} = \mathbb{Z}_9$. We find that this not a field under the afore stated operations.
Not all the non-zero elements, notably 3 and 9 ($\gcd(3,9) \not=1$ and $\gcd(6,9) \not=1$), do not have multiplicative inverses. Indeed, as Wikipedia states , Even though all fields of size $p$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, for $n \ge 2$ the
  ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ (the ring of integers modulo $p^n$) is not a field. The
  element $p$ $(\bmod\ p^n)$ is nonzero and has no multiplicative inverse. Looking for examples, we find one here for $GF(2^3)$. This is based on polynomials. Now, coming to my original point on (understanding) subfield or prime subfield
of finite fields, please tell me, Whether it is totally impossible to construct purely numerical examples of 
fields of size $p^n$. Given a (non-numerical) field of size $p^n$, (one can be found in page 90 (16) of this document ), what is the best way to identify the subfield(s) and prime subfield?

  Prove that $n$ must be prime. I just proved this exercise, but I think it needs extra conditions. We can prove the statement if $R$ is ring without zero divisors. It's not needed $R$ to be commutative or to have an identity. Here is the proof. Let $n$ is characteristic which is not prime. So $n = mk$ and neither $m$ nor $k$ are characteristic so exists $a,b\in R$ for $ma\ne0$ and $kb\ne 0$. So we have $0 = n(ab) = mk(ab)=(ma)(kb)$ which contradicts that $R$ hasn't zero divisors. What is wrong with this proof? Definition 2.16 If $R$ is an arbitrary ring and there exists a positive
  integer $n$ such that $nr = 0$ for every $r \in R$ (i.e. $r$ added to itself $n$
  times is the zero element) then the least such positive integer $n$ is

Furthermore, the next sentence is very interesting too as I in another exercise am to do the same thing but with standard normal priors; If instead one considers a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution $X\sim N (0,1)$, most of the mass is concentrated in a (high dimensional) unit sphere centered at the origin.

I can show that $H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ is a finite local $A$-algebra.

414897,Moment Generating Function of an Unspecified Distribution,"This is the original question - I have inserted my own attempt at it, please critique as you wish. Suppose we are interested in looking at the number of times a stock drops before it first increases in value. It is known that the stock value increases with probability $\theta$ . Let $Y$ be the number of times the stock value drops before it first increases in value. Find the MGF of Y, and hence E(Y). Now suppose that we are interested in 3 stocks. It is known that independently each stock's value will increase with probability $\theta$ . Let $Y_i$ be the number of times the stock value drops before it first increases in value for stocks 1,2 and 3 respectively. Let $V=5Y_1-3Y_2+2Y_3$ . Find the MGF of V. I assume this can be modelled as a Poisson distribution. Hence it has pdf of $p(y)=\frac{\theta^x e^{-\theta}}{y!}$ $$E(e^{ty})=\sum\limits_{y=1}^\infty e^{ty}f(y)=e^{-\theta}e^{et\theta}\sum\limits_{y=1}^\infty \frac{(e^t\theta)^y e^{-(e^t\theta)}}{y!}$$ Which would result in MFG of $e^{\theta(e^t-1)}$ . After differentiation and $t=0$ , it is obtained that $E(Y)=\theta$ .

414916,"Clarification about a double summation found in the book ""Concrete Mathematics""","I think this question may be viewed as too simplistic, or even dumb with respect to the other types of questions asked on this site. In chapter 2 section 4 (multiple sums) of Concrete Mathematics(Graham,Knuth,Patashnik) the authors seem to have 2 different ways to solve a double sum, but interchange their methods from question to question, so it gets kind of difficult to see what they're doing. In particular, they start off with a question like this: \begin{equation}
 S = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{1 \le j < k \le n}^{}{(a_k - a_j)(b_k - b_j)}
\end{equation} And simply solve it by changing the index variables to get:
\begin{equation}
 S = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{1 \le k < j \le n}^{}{(a_j - a_k)(b_j - b_k)}
\end{equation} Then factor out a $-1$ to get the original summation but written differently. Then they go on to add S to itself using the Iverson identity: 
$[1 \le j < k \le n] + [1 \le k < j \le n] = [1 \le j, k \le n] - [1 \le j = k \le n]$ And solve each sum accordingly. However when faced with a different summation, they re-write it and sum 1st on some index variable. My confusion comes from the fact that they just interchange this method of solving double sums, without stating the change. How would one know to solve a double sum by changing the order of summation or by finding a new Iverson identity? Thanks,","['summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
414919,Balanced factors,"A non-square number cannot be factored to two identical factors. However, not all non-squares are equal: some of them can be factored to relatively close factors (for example, $6=2*3$), while others can be factored only to faraway factors (for example, $27=9*3$). Formally, define a number $N$ as $R$-balanced (for $R \geq 1$), if it can be factored as $N=A*B$, such that $A \geq B$, and $A / B \leq R$. For example: $9=3*3$, therefore (like all other square numbers) is $1$-balanced, and also $2$-balanced, $3$-balanced, etc. $6=2*3$, therefore it is $1.5$-balanced, and also $2$-balanced, but not $1$-balanced. $27=9*3$, therefore it is $3$-balanced. $7=7*1$, therefore it is $7$-balanced (similarly, every prime number $p$ is $p$-balanced). I am interested in the density of the balanced integers. Specifically: A. Is there an asymptotic formula for the number of $R$-balanced integers smaller than $N$? For $R=1$, it is easy - the number of $1$-balanced integers smaller than $N$ is $\theta (\sqrt{N})$, so the density is $\theta (1/\sqrt{N})$, which goes to $0$ as $N$ goes to infinity. Is this also true for $R=2$? Is there an $R$ for which the density of $R$-balanced numbers becomes constant? B. Is there an asymptotic formula for the distance between an integer $N$ and the closest $R$-balanced integer larger than $N$? For $R=1$, it is easy - the closest $1$-balanced integer larger than $N$ is $\lceil\sqrt{N}\rceil^2$, and the distance from $N$ is at most $2 \sqrt{N} + 1$, which goes to infinity as $N$ goes to infinity. Is this also true for $R=2$? Is there an $R$ for which the distance to the closest $R$-balanced number becomes constant?","['factoring', 'number-theory']"

What I'd like to do is as follows. First find $a,b,c$ nonzero integers so that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Then find a nonzero integers $d$ and $e$ so that $c^2 + d^2 = e^2$. Then find nonzero integers $f$ and $g$ so that $e^2 + f^2 = g^2$. Note that then
$$
g^2 = e^2 + f^2 = c^2 + d^2 + f^2 = a^2 + b^2 + d^2 + f^2
$$
and I'd like to continue in this way. However, I am wondering if this construction is even possible? Am I always guaranteed that such a string of integers exist? If so, how do I prove this rigorously? Another thought of mine is use Euclid's Formula . For example, let $m = 3$ and $n = 1$. Then
$$
\begin{align*}
a &= 3^2 - 1^2 = 8\\
b &= 2\cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 6\\
c &= 3^2 + 1^2 = 10.
\end{align*}
$$
Furthermore, $c = 2\cdot 5 \cdot 1$, so letting $m = 5$ and $n = 1$ gives
$$
\begin{align*}
d &= 5^2 - 1^2 = 24\\
e &= 5^2 + 1^2 = 26.
\end{align*}
$$
And again, $e = 2\cdot 13 \cdot 1$, so letting $m = 13$ and $n = 1$ gives
$$\begin{align*}
f &= 13^2 - 1^2 = 168\\
g &= 13^2 + 1^2 = 170.
\end{align*}$$
Then
$$\begin{align*}
g^2 = 170^2 = 26^2 + 168^2 = 10^2 + 24^2 + 168^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 + 24^2 + 168^2
\end{align*}
$$
Going one more step we can write $170 = 2\cdot 17 \cdot 5$ so $m = 17$ and $n = 5$ gives 
$$\begin{align*}
h &= 17^2 - 5^2 = 264\\
i &= 17^2 + 5^2 = 314,
\end{align*}$$
in which $314 = 2\cdot 157 \cdot 1$. It seems I may be on the right track, but I'm not sure if this is true in general. Maybe it can be proven that this process can be continued arbitrarily given we start with two distinct primes $m$ and $n$ in the first step? Any thoughts or references or anything would be wonderful.

414981,number of potential couples,"A potential couple is a pair of a man and a woman that like each other (assume that 'like' is a symmetric relation). Given a group of $M$ men and $W$ women, I want to know how many different potential couples there are; mark this number by $C(M,W)$. Suppose we know that, in a certain group of men and women, $C(3,3) \geq 1$, i.e., in every triple of men and triple of women, there is at least one man and one woman that like each other. What is a lower bound for $C(M,W)$? I started by looking at $C(3,4)$. If there are 3 men and 4 women, we can put one woman aside, then we know that there is a potential couple within the remaining 3 men and 3 women, then we can put the woman of that couple aside and return the 4th woman, then again we have 3 men and 3 women that must contain a different potential couple, so the total number of couples must be at least 2: $C(3,4) \geq 2$. The same goes for 4 men and 3 women (in general, $C(M,W)=C(W,M)$). Continuing the same way, $C(3,W)=C(W,3) \geq W-2$. A similar calculation leads to: $C(4,W) \geq W-1$. However, for $C(4,6)$ we can get a better bound than $5$ - since $C(3,6) \geq 4$, at least one of the 3 men must be involved in at least 2 potential couples. If we put this man aside, and then bring the 4th man, that 4th man must be involved in 2 potential couples. Therefore, $C(4,6) \geq C(3,6)+2 \geq 6$. In general, for calculating a lower bound on $C(M,W)$, we can EITHER take a lower bound on $C(M-1,W)$, divide it by M, take the ceiling and add, OR take a lower bound on $C(M,W-1)$, divide it by W, take the ceiling and add. So to get the best lower bound, we should take the maximum of these two. I created a spreadsheet with the lower bounds on $C(M,W)$ up to $M=W=21$, where you can see the exact formula that I used. I cannot see any pattern - can you? Can you suggest a closed formula for $C(M,W)$, or at least an asymptotic bound?

If $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of finite groups closed under isomorphism and normal products, then there is a subgroup $O_\mathcal{F}(G)$ called the $\mathcal{F}$-radical which is the normal product of all normal subgroups of $G$ that are in $\mathcal{F}$. If $\mathcal{F}$ additionally is closed under normal subgroups, $O_\mathcal{F}(G)$ has the property that a subgroup of $G$ is a subnormal subgroup from $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if it is a subnormal subgroup of $O_\mathcal{F}(G)$. This is standard material on Fitting classes, covered in say 6.3 of Kurzweil–Stellmacher's textbook. I'd like to conclude quite generally that $O_\mathcal{F}(MN) = O_\mathcal{F}(M) O_\mathcal{F}(N)$. This is definitely true of direct products, and I'm having a hard time seeing any relevant differences to the normal product. However, I am also having trouble proving it. I get that $O_\mathcal{F}(M) O_\mathcal{F}(N) \leq O_\mathcal{F}(MN)$ in general, simply because $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under normal products. How do I show the reverse containment? If it is not true, is there some extra hypothesis on $\mathcal{F}$ that does it (like subgroup or quotient closure)? The particular case of concern is $\mathcal{F}$ consisting of all $\pi$-groups. I can brute-force it for $\mathcal{F}$ consisting of all solvable $\pi$-groups, and technically all groups my audience was considering were solvable, but I'd prefer a technique that worked in general, or some counterexamples to show what extra hypotheses are actually being used. For instance, in my application $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under quotients and all subgroups too (a subgroup closed (saturated by Bryce-Cossey) Fitting formation), but I doubt much if any of that extra hypothesis is needed. Edit: Assume $\mathcal{F}$ is quotient closed for the positive answer. I don't current have a counterexample for the general $\mathcal{F}$, but they are apparently plentiful and well known. Apparently direct products don't work this way for general $\mathcal{F}$ (for any normal Fitting class properly contain in the class of all solvable groups, for instance). Lockett figured out how to fix this in a fairly low impact way. For any Fitting class $\mathcal{F}$, he associated $\mathcal{F}^*$ with the property that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{F}^* = \mathcal{F}^{**} \subseteq \mathcal{F} \mathcal{A}$ and that $O_{\mathcal{F}^*}(G \times H) = O_{\mathcal{F}^*}(G) \times O_{\mathcal{F}^*}(H)$ and $O_{\mathcal{F}^*}(G) = \{ g \in G : (g,h) \in O_\mathcal{F}(G\times G) \}$. Theorem 2.2d shows that if $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under quotients or residual products (the other aspect of being a formation), then $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}^*$, so all Fitting formations work the way I thought. ...

Then $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and for $m \in \mathbb{N}_0$ we have $$ \left(\frac{d}{dz}\right)^m F(z) = \int_X \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^m f(x,z) d\mu(x).$$ An induction follows and in the step from $m$ to $m+1$ the following argument is used. Let $(z_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence convergent to $z_0$ , $z_n \in U_{2r}(z_0)$ . By the Cauchy Integral Formula $$\frac{f^{(m)}(x, z_n)-f^{(m)}(x,z_0)}{z_n-z_0} = \frac{m!}{2\pi i (z_n-z_0)} \int_{\mathcal{C}} \frac{f(x,\zeta)}{(\zeta-z_n)^{m+1}}-\frac{f(x,\zeta)}{(\zeta-z_0)^{m+1}} d\zeta$$ with $\mathcal{C} = \{\zeta : |\zeta-z_0|=2r\}$ . And then the following upper bound is given: $$\left|\frac{f^{(m)}(x, z_n)-f^{(m)}(x,z_0)}{z_n-z_0}\right| \leq \frac{m!g(x)}{2\pi |z_n-z_0|} \int_{\mathcal{C}} \frac{|z_n-z_0|(\sum_{j=0}^m |\zeta-z_n|^j|\zeta-z_0|^{m-j})}{|\zeta-z_n|^{m+1}|\zeta-z_0|^{m+1}}d|\zeta|$$ Any hint to how this last bound is derived would be very much appreciated.","['functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

415103,Basic discrete math question regarding translation of logic ↔ English,"I just started Discrete Mathematics, and am having a little bit of trouble in understanding the conversions of English ↔ logic. $p$ : ""you get an A on the final exam."" $q$ : ""you do every exercise in the book."" $r$ : ""you get an A in the class."" Problem 1 Convert to logic using $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ : You get an A on the final, but you don't do every exercise in the book.  Nevertheless, you get an A in the class. What's screwing me up is the word “nevertheless.”  At first I wrote $p \land \lnot q \land r$ , then I thought about it and changed it to $(p \land \lnot q) \to r$ , and somehow that seems like a better answer, but I have no idea why. What I find hard to understand is when a sentence requires a conditional ( $\to$ ).  Does the translation for the above sentences need a conditional?  There was a question earlier in the homework that said to translate $p \lor q \lor r$ to English, but how do you translate a bunch of variables with no conditional into an English sentence that makes sense?","['logic-translation', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
415135,Is my proof correct? $2^n=x^2+23$ has an infinite number of (integer) solutions.,"This is how I tried to prove it. Is it correct? Thanks!! $2^n = x^2+23$ $x^2$ must be odd, therefore $x^2 = 4k+1$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$. $2^n=4k+24$ $k=2(2^{n-3}-3)$ Since $x^2=4k+1$,$ \ \ \ \ $ $k_1 = \frac{x_1^2-1}{4}$ and $k_2=\frac{(x_1+2)^2-1}{4}=\frac{x_1^2+4x_1+3}{4}$ If we substitute $x_1^2=4k_1 + 1$, we end up with: $k_2=k_1 + \sqrt{4k_1+1} + 1$ Therefore, finding solutions of $k=2(2^{n-3} - 3)$ is comparable to finding the solutions of $k+\sqrt{4k+1}+1=2(2^{n-3}-3)$ Let $p=2(2^{n-3}-3)$ Therefore, $(\sqrt{4k+1})^2=(p-k-1)^2$, so $(p-k)^2 = 2(p+k)$ Since $p$ has an infinite number of solutions $(p-k)^2=2(p+k)$ also has an infinite number of solutions, which implies  the the original does also.","['elementary-number-theory', 'algebra-precalculus', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
415141,Is there a problem when defining exponential with negative base?,"Well, this question may seem silly at first, but I'll make my point clear. Suppose $n \in \Bbb N$ and suppose $a \in \Bbb R$ is any number. Then the definition of $a^n$ is clear for any $a$ we choose. Indeed we define: $$a^n = \prod_{k=1}^na$$ And even if $a$ is negative this has a meaning. Then we extend the definition for $n \in \Bbb Z$ and for $n \in \Bbb Q$. When we are to define to $n \in\Bbb R$ we define it as: $$a^x=e^{x\ln a}$$ That's fine, but $\ln $ is a function defined on $\Bbb R^+$ so that if we try to compute $(-5)^\pi$ we'll get into trouble because this would be: $$(-5)^{\pi}=e^{\pi \ln(-5)}$$ But $\ln (-5)$ is undefined. In that case, the function that $f : A \subset \Bbb R^2 \to \Bbb R$ given by $f(a,x) = a^x$ would be undefined if $a < 0$, so that $A = \Bbb R^+ \times \Bbb R$. What I thought was: we can extend this function when $a$ is negative and $x$ is rational. In that case we would set it to the old definition of exponentiation, since we would have a real raised to a rational. So, for negative base and irrational exponent the exponential remains undefined?
