67438,"Given $A^2+cA+cI=0$, how to find inverse of $A+(c-1)I$?","Suppose a square matrix $A$ such that $A^2+cA+cI=0$ for all $c \in \mathbb{Z}$. How can I show that $A+(c-1)I$ is invertible and find its inverse? I started off this way:
$A+(c-1)I = A+cI-I$ Then $(A+cI-I)(d_1A+d_2I)=I$, where $d_1, d_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Expand it and it becomes:
$d_1A^2+d_1cA-d_1A+d_2A+(c-1)d_2I=I$ $\Rightarrow 

(c-1)d_2=1 \;\; and \; \; d_1A^2+d_1cA-d_1A+d_2A=0$ $\Rightarrow 
d_2=\frac{1}{(c-1)}$ Continue from $d_1A^2+d_1cA-d_1A+d_2A=0$, after some manipulation, I got $d_1(A^2+cA+cI)-d_1cI-d_1A+d_2A=0$. Since given that $A^2+cA+cI=0$, $d_1(A^2+cA+cI)-d_1cI-d_1A+d_2A=0$ $\Rightarrow 
-d_1cI-d_1A+d_2A=0$ $\Rightarrow 
-d_1cI-d_1A+\frac{1}{c-1}A=0$ $\Rightarrow 
-d_1cI-d_1A=-\frac{1}{c-1}A$ $\Rightarrow 
d_1(cI+A)=\frac{1}{c-1}A$ At this point, since I don't know if $A$ is invertible yet, I cannot do it as $d_1=\frac{1}{c-1}\frac{A}{(cI+A)}$. Even if I did this, I still cannot find a value for $d_1$ and $d_2$ to find the inverse of $A+(c-1)I$. How should I continue from here?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

67467,"Evaluate $\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2} \frac{e^{i \langle \xi, x \rangle} d\xi}{ \langle\xi,\theta\rangle}$","The task is to evalute 
$$
\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2} \frac{e^{i \langle \xi, x \rangle} d\xi}{ \langle\xi,\theta\rangle}, \;\;\; \theta \in \mathbb{C}^2 \setminus ( \mathbb{S}^1 \cup \left\{ 0 \right\} ), \;\;\; \theta_1^2 + \theta_2^2 = 1,\;\;\;  x\in \mathbb{R}^2

Obviously it is the Fourrier transform of $f(\xi) = \langle
\xi,\theta \rangle ^ {-1}$. I tried to make the change $y_{1} = \langle\xi,\Re \theta\rangle, \;\; y_2 = \langle \xi, \Im \theta \rangle$, but i faced with difficult calculations. Update: let 
$$
 f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2} \frac{e^{i \langle \xi, x \rangle} d\xi}{ \langle\xi,\theta\rangle}
$$
Then, using inverse Fourrier transform we get
$$
 i\langle\theta,\xi\rangle \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
$$
Taking Fourier transform now we recieve
$$

Let $A$ and $B$ be any set. Prove: $A$ is the disjoint union of $A\setminus B$ and $A\cap B$ $A\cup B$ is the disjoint union of $A\setminus B$, $A\cap B$, and $B\setminus A$. Part 1 Suppose $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint. Then, $$
\{x | x\in A\setminus B\text{ and }x\in A\cap B\}
$$ Since $A\subseteq A\setminus B$ and $A\subseteq A\cap B$, $A\setminus B = A\cap B$. So, $A\setminus B\nsubseteq B$, or $A\setminus B\subseteq B^{C}$, and $A\cap B\subseteq B$. Then, $B\cup B^{C} = \emptyset$, and $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Part 2 Suppose $A\cup B$ is not disjoint. Then, $$
\{x | x\in A\setminus B\text{ and }x\in A\cap B\text{ and }x\in B\setminus A\}
$$ $A\setminus B\subseteq B^{C}$, $A\cap B\subseteq A$, $A\cap B\subseteq B$, and $B\setminus A\subseteq A^{C}$. But since $B\cup B^{C} = \emptyset$ and $A\cap A^{C} = \emptyset$, $A\cup B$ is disjoint.",['elementary-set-theory']

Let '$a_{(1,j)}$' define the following series: $a_{(1,1)}=1$, $a_{(1,n)}=a_{(1,(n-1))}+2$. Let $a_{(i,j)}$ define the following arithmetic progression for $i>1$: $a_{(i,1)}=a_{((i-1),1)}+1+i$, $a_{(i,n)}=a_{(i,(n-1))}+2\cdot i$.

An emphasis on the 'proof' part because using semi-intuitive techniques from high school (that's as far as I go) I've found the following formula, which seems to work: $\frac{1}{2}(n^3+2n^2-n)$. But of course I have no proof that this formula is inductively correct. Assuming the formula I found earlier is correct, would the fact that it is a polynomial of 3rd degree hold for other 'triangles of arithmetic progressions'? (This interests me because of the seeming connection between the number '3' and our 'triangle' of sorts.) Thank you for your help.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

If $X$ is complete, then there exists an unique fixed point. But is there an incomplete space for which this property holds as well?

67491,Limit of a decreasing sequence of outer measures is an outer measure?,"The problem given to me on my homework is: Prove that the limit of a decreasing family of outer measures is an outer measure. Doing out the ""obvious"" approach, we quickly reach the problem of wanting to say that
$$\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\mu_j^*\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\leq\lim_{j\to\infty}\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty\;\mu_j^*(A_i)\right)\underbrace{\leq}_{\text{PROBLEM}}\sum_{i=1}^\infty\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\mu_j^*(A_i)\right)$$
The problem, as I see it, is that Fatou's Lemma has the inequality going the opposite way of what we want here (by the way, this course hasn't actually gotten to integration yet). In fact, I think the claim is false, because I can imagine very well having the following scenario: $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^\infty\subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a family of subsets of $X$ (disjoint, probably) $\mu_j^*:\mathcal{P}(X)\to[0,\infty]$ are decreasing family of outer measures on $X$ with the property that
$$\mu_j^*(A_i)=\begin{cases}1\text{ if }j\leq i\\ 0\text{ if }j>i \end{cases}$$
(This certainly would not be in conflict with the assumption that the $\mu_j^*$ are decreasing, i.e. that $\mu_j^*(A)\geq\mu_{j+1}^*(A)$ for all $j\in\mathbb{N}$ and $A\subseteq X$.) Letting $\mu^*:\mathcal{P}(X)\to[0,\infty]$ be defined by $\mu^*(A)=\lim_{j\to\infty}\mu_j^*(A)$, we conclude immediately that $\mu^*(\varnothing)=0$ and that $\mu^*(A)\leq\mu^*(B)$ when $A\subseteq B$, but we then have that
$$\mu^*\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)=\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\mu_j^*\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\geq\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\mu_j^*(A_j)=\lim_{j\to\infty}\;1=1$$
while
$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty\;\mu^*(A_i)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\mu_j^*(A_i)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\;\;{1\text{ if }j\leq i\atop 0\text{ if }j>i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\;0=0 $$
so that 
$$\mu^*\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\not\leq\sum_{i=1}^\infty\;\mu^*(A_i)$$
and therefore $\mu^*$ is not an outer measure. So, giving as little away as possible (as this is a homework question), is the scenario I proposed above impossible? I tried to construct examples with $X=\mathbb{N}$ and the value of $\mu_j^*(A)$ depending on whether $A\cap\{1,\ldots,j\}=\varnothing$, but that didn't get anywhere.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

67512,Open Mapping Theorem (complex analysis),"In all the proofs I can find of the Open Mapping Theorem ( for example here ) at the outset it is mentioned that it is enough to prove that for all a in U, f(a) is contained in a disk that is itself contained in f(U). How is that enough? One needs to prove that for every open set U' (that is a subset of U) the theorem holds, however the U used in that opening statement is a connected open set (and thus a stricter condition). I find that every way I try and reconcile this I run into something non-trivial (e.g. Considering any open set a countable union of connected open sets. Can you do that in R n ? Does it require a finitely dimensioned space or any other such restriction?), even though the proof's statement suggests it is obvious that proving for U is enough. Stumped. Thanks. EDIT I'm aware that the statement proves that f(U) is open (as a union of open disks), that's not what I'm asking. My question is how is that enough to prove that f is open, i.e. f(V) is open for every V open subset of U (in particular since V may not be connected like U and certainly need not be a disk).",['complex-analysis']

67589,Computing the projection of an infinite 3D grid of points,"Consider the subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of points whose coordinates are integers (compare Gaussian integers , Euclid's orchard ). The view of $S$ from a perspective camera within the space has interesting structure; it has visible density variations that indicate planes intersecting the viewpoint with rational slopes, and the image can be interpreted as many different three-dimensional structures. This image is actually of a finite subset of $S$, cubical and centered around the camera. (Increasing the number of points would narrow the width of the black empty regions.) The question: I would like a practical-to-compute function for rendering the infinite-grid version of this image; that is, a function from a direction (and perhaps a small solid angle for the pixel size) to a brightness for the pixel. I'm not sure whether that result should be: the distance to the nearest point in $S$ in that direction, or the density of points in that direction. As described in the Wikipedia article for Euclid's orchard , the two-dimensional zero-angle version of the function I'm looking for is Thomae's function ; but that function is (a) giving a projection of the two-dimensional analogue of $S$ rather than $S$, (b) giving the view from an infinitely thin ray rather than over a small angle, and (c) is not practical to compute using floating-point arithmetic on a GPU.","['geometry', 'visualization']"

67616,Shifting the line of integration over the critical stripe of an L-function,"Let $F$ be an L-function in the sense of the Selberg class --> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selberg_class . We are observing the integral 
$$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{(c)}F(s+w)\Gamma(w)z^w dw$$
for $\Re(s)>1$ and $c>0$. Why can we shift the line of integration to the left, say, to $(-R)$, where $R$ is some positive real number, non-integer, the difference coming only from the residues in between? This is equivalent to asking why does the integral of $F(s+w)\Gamma(w)z^w$ over the horizontal line segments vanish when we push them to $\pm i\infty$? The thing is that by doing so we are moving the line of integration over the critical stripe of $F$. Outside the critical stripe we can combine the Stirling's approximation of $\Gamma(w)$ with the fact that $F(\sigma+ it)$ is $o(t)$, when $t\to\infty$, as a Dirichlet series, plus Stirling's approximation for the Gamma-factors of the functional equation, when we observe the asymptotics of $F$ left from the critical stripe. However, is there a simple way to obtain some basic ""vertical asymptotics"" of $F$ over the critical stripe that would allow us the aforementioned move? My only idea is to use the fact that $(s-1)^m F(s)$ ($m$ is the multiplicity of the pole of $F$ in $s=1$) is an entire function of finite order. But unless the order is $1$, it would actually appear to overweight any Stirling's approximation. I guess, I am missing something obvious in the whole story. The reason why I am asking this is because the above argument appears to be pretty standard throughout various materials conerning L-functions, starting with the more elementary Dedekind-L-functions and going through automorphic L-functions and similar. Thus is seems to be a general argument that is not closely related to the specifics of each of these L-functions, and I would like to understand the principle behind it.

67731,Outer measure defined on sets of $\mathbb R$ - help with showing if outer measure or not,"I have a long list of definitions of outer measures that I am trying to (a) show IF they are outer measures, and (b) if it is, determine its outer measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$. My books requirements for an outer measure are: $ \mu^{\ast}(\varnothing) = 0$, if $A \subset B \subset X$, then $\mu^{\ast}(A) \leq \mu^{\ast}(B)$, and if $\{A_n\}$ is an infinite sequence of subsets of $X$, then $\mu^{\ast}\left(\bigcup_n\,A_n\right) \leq \sum_n \, \mu^{\ast}(A_n),$ For instance, two of them, defined on the power set of $\mathbb{R}$, are (from Cohn's book by the way): $\mu_3^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is bounded, and  $1$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_4^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is empty, $1$ if $A$ is non-empty and bounded, and $+\infty$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_5^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is countable, $b$ if $A$ is uncountable, where $b$ can equal a finite number or $+\infty$. First, I am only 90% sure the authors means the reals and no the affinely extended reals: $\mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty\} \cup \{+\infty\}$?? Now for $\mu_3^{\ast}$ , (1) I am assuming the empty set $\varnothing$ is bounded, or else the first criteria of an outer measure fails (and besides I have read different ideas in different place - most seem to think it is both bounded and unbounded?). (2) Then for $A \subset B$ (does the author mean proper, as in not $A \subseteq B$??), I can say that the monotonocity inequality is satisfied if they are both the same, bounded or unbounded, and that, since a bounded set (at least on $\mathbb{R}$) cannot contain an unbounded set, the only remaining possibility is if $A$ is bounded and $B$ is unbounded, in which case the inequality is satisfied. (3) Lastly, it is certain the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ contains bounded sets, but also it contains $\mathbb{R}$ itself, which is unbounded, so the countably infinite union of elements of the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ is 1 (the left-hand side of the inequality). Since there is only one unbounded (a set missing at least one of either left or right boundaries) subset of $\mathbb{R}$(??) then the right-hand side of the inequality is 1. For $\mu_4^{\ast}$ , (1) same as above (2) Bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are of the form $(a,b)$, $[a,b]$, $(a,b]$, or $[a,b)$. So case by case, respecting $A \subset B$ (proper) shows this criteria for outer measure is satisfied: $\hspace{2cm}$ both bounded: $1 \leq 1$ $\hspace{2cm}$ both unbounded: $+\infty \leq +\infty$, as in $\mu^{\ast}((a,+\infty)) \leq \mu^{\ast}(\mathbb{R})$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A = \varnothing$ and $B$ is bounded and $B \neq \varnothing$ implies $0 \leq 1$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A = \varnothing$ and $B$ is unbounded implies $0 \leq +\infty$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A$ is bounded and $B$ is unbounded implies $1 \leq +\infty$ (3) So for the left hand side of the inequality, $\mu^{\ast}(T:=\cup_n\,A_n)$, I know that $T$ is at least as `big' as $\mathbb{R}$, because $\mathbb{R} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$. Therefore, I think it is either $+\infty$ or a higher cardinality - kind of how the natural numbers are infinite but their power set is $\aleph_0$. For the right-hand side, $\sum_n\,A_n$, I can't see anything more than something like $0 + 0 + \cdots + 1 + 1 + \cdots + {}^+\infty + {}^+\infty + \cdots = {}^+\infty$. Therefore, the cardinality is the problem I don't understand here(??). For $\mu_5^{\ast}$ I haven't yet figured out the gist of this with respect to countability, but I do know that countability (not finite) is where there is a bijection between a subset of the naturals ($\aleph_0$), and that the power set of the naturals has cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$. If this is the case (??) then maybe any help with the above can help this problem too.

An exercise in Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi asks the student to show that this map induces an isomorphism of the centers $Z(R)$ and $Z(E)$. I can show that an element of $Z(E)$ must be a left multiplication by an element of $Z(R)$, but somehow I can't see why an element of $Z(R)$ is necessarily mapped to an element of $Z(E)$. Clearly the image $\lambda_r$ of some $r \in Z(R)$ must commute with all the other left multiplication endomorphisms, but I can't convince myself that there won't be some other endomorphism with which it won't commute.

Let $P_n$ be the collection of (not number of) all partitions of an $n$-element set. My approach was to find an injection from $P_n \times P_n$ into $P_{n-1} \times P_{n+1}$. Suppose we are to map $(C_1, D_1)$ to $(C_2, D_2)$ and suppose, for convenience, our ground set is the integers from $1$ to $n$. A natural seeming choice was to choose $C_2$ to be the partition $C_1$ with the element $n$ removed. Since removing $n$ will map many partitions in $P_n$ to the same partition in $P_{n-1}$, we would need somehow to choose $D_2$ in such a way as to retain information about where $n$ was in $C_1$.

My solution: First we find all sets $\{a, b, c\}$ such that $a + b + c = 13; \; a, b, c \le 6$: $\{1, 6, 6\}$ $\{2, 5, 6\}$ $\{3, 4, 6\}, \{3, 5, 5\}$ $\{4, 4, 5\}$ The total number of sets that fit these criteria is $5$.

If $a = b \not= c$, then there exist $3$ unique permutations of $\{a, b, c\}$. -- There cannot be a set such that $a = b = c$. There are $2$ sets of the first kind and $3$ of the second. It follow that the total number of triple die rolls that can fit the criteria is \begin{equation*}
