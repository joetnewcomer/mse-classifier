311935,Algebraic Number Theory - Lemma for Fermat's Equation with $n=3$,"I have to prove the following, in my notes it is lemma before Fermat's Equation, case $n=3$. I was able to prove everything up to the last two points: Let $\zeta=e^{(\frac{2\pi i}{3})}$. Consider $A:=\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]=\{a+\zeta b \quad|\quad a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Then $\zeta$ is a root of the irreducible poly. $X^2+X+1$. The field of fractions of $A$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ The norm map $N:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})\rightarrow \mathbb{Q},$ given by $a+\sqrt{-3}b \mapsto a^2+3b^2$ is multiplicative and sends every element in $A$ to an element in $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, $u\in A$ is a unit iff $N(u)\in\{-1,1\}$. Moreover, if $N(a)=\pm$ prime number, then $a$ is irreducible. The unit group $A^x$ is cyclic of order $6$. ($A^x=\{\pm 1, \pm\zeta, \pm\zeta^2\}$) The ring $A$ is Euclidean with respect to the norm $N$ and hence a unique factorisation domain. The element $\lambda=1-\zeta$ is a prime element in $A$ and $3=-\zeta^2\lambda^2$. The quotient $A$ / $(\lambda)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_3$. The image of the set $A^3=\{a^3|a\in A\}$ under $\pi: A \rightarrow A / (\lambda^4)=A / (9)$ is equal to $\{0+(\lambda^4),\pm 1+(\lambda^4),\pm \lambda^3+(\lambda^4)\}$ I was not able to prove 7 and 8. For 7 I do not even know which isomorphism, I guess it should be an isomorphism of rings? I hope anybody knows what to do or has at least some hints, Thanks in advance for your help!","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
311942,Probability of two buses being in a bus stop at the same time,"Question statement: The bus type of A arrives to a certain bus stop every 30 minutes and waits for 5 minutes. The bus type of B arrives every 60 minutes and waits for 4 minutes. Probabilities of arrival of these two bus types have uniform density, and they are independent of each other. A man goes to the bus stop at a random time, and starts waiting. What is the probability that two buses be in the bus stops at the same time (i.e.; their waiting time periods intersect with each other)? This was a question I came across last year when I was studying probability theory. I couldn't solve it then and I am still not able to solve it. I can't even find a starting point.

311950,An elementary way to show any bounded subset of $\Bbb{R}^k$ is totally bounded,"I'm trying to show that any subset bounded of $\Bbb{R}^k$ is totally bounded. Here is what I did: (1)A subset of a totally bounded Set is bounded: Proof: Let $X$ be a totally bounded subset and $Y\subset X$ then there exists an $\epsilon /2$-net $\{x_1,x_2,..,x_n\}$ and $X\subset \displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^n B(x_i,\epsilon/2)$ . Let $\{x_1,x_2,..,x_m\}$ be the points whose balls contain $Y$ $(m\le n)$. Now $\forall i \in \{1,..,m\} \exists q_i \in A \cap B(x_i,\epsilon/2) $ and $B(x_i,\epsilon/2)\subset B(q_i,\epsilon)$. We have for every $x\in B(x_i,\epsilon/2)$ $$ d(x,q_i)\le d(x,x_i)+d(x_i,q_i) < \frac \epsilon 2 + \frac \epsilon 2 =\epsilon$$ Hence $Y \subset \displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^m B(x_i,\epsilon/2) \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^m B(q_i,\epsilon)$ and $q_i \in Y$ for all $i$ hence $Y$ is totally bounded Back to the problem: Let $A \subset \Bbb{R}^k$ be a bounded set  then $A \subset B(0,R)$ for some $R$ then $A \subset [-R,R] \times [-R,R] \times ...\times [-R,R] $ then $A$ is a subset of a compact set by the Heine-Borel Theorem which is also a totally bounded set, hence by (1) $A$ is totally bounded. I'm trying to do this problem by only using (1) without invoking the Heine-Borel theorem, can anyone tell me how that can be done?

311953,Equivalent definitions of Noetherian topological space,"It is well known that we have many different definitions of noetherianity for rings. Namely, given a ring $R$, the following are equivalent: 1) every ideal of $R$ is finitely generated. 2) $R$ satisfies a.c.c. (ascending chain condition) on ideals. 3) every non-empty set of ideals of $R$ has a maximal element. I would like to state something similar for topological spaces. First a definiton: we call a closed subset of a topological space irreducible if it cannot be decomposed in the union of two proper closed subsets. Now i want to prove: Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent: 1') every closed subset $Y$ of $X$ has a decomposition
$$Y=Y_1\cup\ldots\cup Y_r$$
where $Y_j$ is irreducible and $Y_j\nsubseteq Y_m$ for $j\neq m$. 2') $X$ satisfies d.c.c. (descending chain condition) on closed subsets. 3') every non-empty set of closed subsets of $X$ has a minimal element. I have a proof for $2')\rightarrow 3')$ and for $3')\rightarrow 1')$, but not for $1')\rightarrow 2')$, maybe because it is false?
Can you help me? EDIT: condition $Y_j\nsubseteq Y_m$ for $j\neq m$ in 1') is needed only for unicity of decomposition, but i'm non intersted in, so we can skip it. I would like 1') to be ""similar"" to 1) in the sense that 1) tells every ideal is finitely generated, and 1') that every closed subset has finitely many irreducible components....","['general-topology', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

311980,Relation between convergence class and convergence space,"A convergence class is defined from nlab A convergence space is a set $S$ together with a relation $→$ from $ℱS$ to $S$, where $ℱS$ is the set of filters on $S$; if $F→x$, we say that $F$ converges to $x$ or that $x$ is a limit of $F$. This must satisfy some axioms: Centred: The principal ultrafilter $F_x=\{A∣x∈A\}$ at $x$ converges to $x$; Isotone: If $F⊆G$ and $F→x$, then $G→x$; Directed: If $F→x$ and $G→x$, then some filter contained in the intersection $F∩G$ converges to $x$. In light of (2), it follows that $F∩G→x$ itself. (Strictly speaking, the relation should not be called directed unless also every point is a limit of some filter, but this follows from 1.) A convergence space is topological if it comes from a topology on S. My questions: The definition can also be phrased in terms of nets; a net $ν$ converges to $x$ if and only if its eventuality filter (defined as
  follows) converges to $x$. Let $X$ be a set, let $D$ be a directed set, and let $n$ be a function from $D$ to $X$, so that $n$ is a net in $X$. Given a
  subset $A$ of $X$, $n$ is eventually in $A$ if, for some $i$ in $D$,
  for each $j≥i$ in $D$, $n_j∈A$. The collection $F_n$ of all those
  subsets $A$ such that $x$ is eventually in $A$ is a proper filter on
  $X$, called the eventuality filter of $n$. I was wondering how the definition of a convergence space can be
equivalently rephrased in terms of nets? How is the definition of a convergence space related the definition of a convergence class which is defined
in terms of nets as following (quoted from Pete Clark at MO ): In the section ""Convergence Classes"" at the end of Chapter 2 of General Topology, Kelley lists the following axioms for convergent
  nets in a topological space $X$ a) If $S$ is a net such that $Sn=s$ for each $n$ [i.e., a constant net], then $S$ converges to $s$. b) If $S$ converges to $s$, so does each subnet. c) If $S$ does not converge to $s$, then there is a subnet of $S$, no subnet of which converges to $s$. d) (Theorem on iterated limits): Let $D$ be a directed set. For each $m\in D$, let $E_m$ be a directed set, let $F$ be the product
  $D \times \prod_{m \in D} E_m$ and for $(m,f)$ in $F$ let
  $R(m,f)=(m,f(m))$. If $S(m,n)$ is an element of $X$ for each $m∈D$
  and $n\in E_m$ and $\lim_m \lim_n S(m,n)=s$, then $S∘R$ converges to
  $s$. He has previously shown that in any topological space, convergence of nets satisfies a) through d). (The first three are easy; part d)
  is, I believe, an original result of his.) In this section he proves
  the converse: given a set $X$ and a set $C$ of pairs (net,point)
  satisfying the four axioms above, there exists a unique topology
  on $X$ such that a net $S$ converges to $s∈X$ iff $(S,s)∈C$. In particular, Kelley's convergence class is topologizable while nlab's convergence space may not be. If by omitting some of its axioms, will the generalization of convergence class become equivalent to nlab's convergence space? Thanks and regards!","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
311984,What tools are used to show a type of convergence is or is not topologizable?,"There are many types of convergence. For example, in measure theory and probability theory, there are many types of convergence of measurable mappings (random variables). in measure theory and probability theory, there are also many types of convergence of measures (over a sigma algebra, a Borel sigma algebra, or ...). in topology, there are topology of pointwise convergence and topology of uniform convergence ( why ?). For other areas, I believe there exist similar examples. They seem very overwhelming and intimidating (to me at least). I have seen some discussion on whether there exists a topology or metric or norm such that some type of convergence is consistent wrt them. For example, convergence a.e. is not topologizable, not to mention metrizable or normable. So I was wondering when studying whether a type of convergence is
topologizable, metrizable, normable, ..., what tools are are used? Are there some general ways to construct the topologies if they exist? Do all the instances of a certain convergence type form a
convergence class? or a convergence space ? Do those convergence structures have some general ways to tell if a certain type of convergence is topologizable and to construct such a topology if there is one?

This is completely baffling. $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$ is certainly LF, but it's equal to $\frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2}$. I can't think of a more not orientation preserving map than complex conjugation followed by scaling. From Wikipedia: The set of LF transformations is isomorphic to the orientation-preserving isometries of $\mathbb{H}^3$. What is the isomorphism here, explicitly? Realize $\mathbb{H}^3$ as the upper-half space in $E^3$.

312107,"Find point $X$ such that line through plane $E$ and sphere $S$ meet at $(0,0,1)$ (stereographic projection)","Find the point $X$ such that the line going through the plane $E$ and sphere $S$ meet at the point $(0,0,1)$ (stereographic projection). Let $S$ denote the unit sphere $$S = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}$$ and $E$ denote the plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $z = 0$ $$E = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid z = 0\}.$$ If $(u,v,0)$ is a point of $E$ then the line joining  $(u,v,0)$ to $(0,0,1)$ meets $S$  in a point other than  $(0,0,1)$. Denote this point by $X(u,v)$. 1) Compute the formula for $X$. [HINT: Any point on the line joining $(u,v,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$ is of the form $\lambda \cdot (u,v,0) + (1 - \lambda) \cdot (0,0,1)$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. We need to determine such $\lambda_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ that $X(u,v) = \lambda_0 \cdot (u,v,0) + (1 - \lambda_0) \cdot (0,0,1)$ lies on $S$.] For this bit, I said using the fact that $$\pmatrix{x\\y\\x} = \lambda_0 \cdot \pmatrix{u \\ v \\ 0} + (1 - \lambda_0)\cdot \pmatrix{0 \\ 0 \\ 1},$$ we get $$x = \lambda_0 \cdot u$$
$$y = \lambda_0 \cdot v$$
$$z = 1 - \lambda_ 0.$$ Putting it in $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ and solving gives us $\lambda_0 = 0, \frac{2}{1 + u^2 + v^2}$. When $\lambda_0 = 0$, we get the point $(0,0,1)$, and according to the question the point that meets $S$ but isn't $(0,0,1)$ and so we pick $\lambda_0 = \frac{2}{1 + u^2 + v^2}$. So we end up getting $$X(u,v) = \left( \frac{2u}{1 + u^2 + v^2}, \frac{2v}{1 + u^2 + v^2}, 1 - \frac{2}{1 + u^2 + v^2}\right).$$ 2) Show that the map $X: \mathbb{r}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ determines a refular surface patch. [HINT: Prove that $X_u \circ X_v = 0$, then show that $a \circ b = $ implies that the vectors $a$ and $b$ are linearly independent] Here $a \circ b$ is the dot product between $a$ and $b$ and $X_u$ is the partial derivative of $X$ with respect to $u$. So the first thing to do was the partial derivatives and I got them to be $$X_u = \left(\frac{2}{1 + u^2 + v^2} - \frac{4u^2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2}, -\frac{4uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2}, \frac{4u}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right)$$
$$X_v = \left( -\frac{4uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2}, \frac{2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)} - \frac{4v^2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2}, \frac{4v}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right)$$ but when I then do the dot product, I don't get them to be $0$. I get it to be $$\left(\frac{2}{1 + u^2 + v^2} - \frac{4u^2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right) \cdot \left( -\frac{4uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right) + \left(-\frac{4uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right) \cdot \left(\frac{2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)} - \frac{4v^2}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right) + \left(\frac{4u}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right) \cdot \left(\frac{4v}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^2} \right),$$ which gives me $$\frac{16u^3v}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4} - \frac{8uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^3} + \frac{16v^3u}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4} - \frac{8uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^3} + \frac{16uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4}$$
$$ = \frac{16u^3v}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4}+ \frac{16v^3u}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4} - \frac{16uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^3} + \frac{16uv}{(1 + u^2 + v^2)^4} \neq 0$$ Where am I making my mistake? 3) How much of the sphere is covered by the parametrization $X$? I also haven't got a clue how to do this bit. Maybe once I sort the first two parts out, I might get an idea. EDIT: Also, I'm thinking that my $X$ is wrong as when I do $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, I don't get it to equal $1$. I'm not sure if it should or not. If it did, then it would lie on the surface of the sphere and not inside it. The question doesn't necasarrily say that it needs to lie on the surface, but I thought if I used the constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ then I've moved to the point on the line that does lie on the surface and so I should get $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ for my $x,y,z$ coordinates for $X$, right?","['linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"
312127,Two trivial questions in general topology,"I'd appreciate some guidance regarding the following 2 questions.

These definitions make no sense to me: how can a ball of a topological space $X$ contain points not from $X$?

312131,Does $gHg^{-1}\subseteq H$ imply $gHg^{-1}= H$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Conjugate subgroup strictly contained in the initial subgroup? (4 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Let $G$ be a group, $H<G$ a subgroup and $g$ an element of $G$. Let $\lambda_g$ denote the inner automorphism which maps $x$ to $gxg^{-1}$. I wonder if $H$ can be mapped to a proper subgroup of itself, i.e.  $\lambda_g(H)\subset H$. I tried to approach this problem topologically. Since every group is the fundamental group of a connected CW-complex of dimension 2, let $(X,x_0)$ be such a space for $G$. Since $X$ is (locally) path-connected and semi-locally simply-connected, there exists a (locally) path-connected covering space $(\widetilde X,\widetilde x_0)$, such that $p_*(\pi_1(\widetilde X,\widetilde x_0))=H$. The element $g$ corresponds to $[\gamma]\in\pi_1(X,x_0))$, and its lift at $\widetilde x_0$ is a path ending at $\widetilde x_1$. By hypothesis, $H\subseteq g^{-1}Hg$, which leads to the existence of a unique lift $f:\pi_1(\widetilde X,\widetilde x_0)\to\pi_1(\widetilde X,\widetilde x_1)$ such that $p=p\circ f$. This lift turns out to be a surjective covering map itself, and it is a homeomorphism iff $H=g^{-1}Hg$. I was unsuccessful in showing the injectivity. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same image under $f$, then $x_1$, $x_2$, and $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ are all in the same fiber. I took $\lambda$ to be a path from $x_1$ to $x_2$. I have been playing around with $\lambda$, $p\lambda$, and $f\lambda$, but got nowhere. Of course, there could also be a direct algebraic proof. On the other hand, if the statement is not true then someone maybe knows of a counterexample.","['covering-spaces', 'algebraic-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'fundamental-groups']"

312159,Free groups and relations. Showing that $G\simeq FG^{(3)}/N$ for $N$ the normal subgroup generated by a set of relations.,"Let $FG^{(3)}$ denote the free group generated by $3$ elements. Let $Z=(\Bbb Z^3,\oplus,{\bf 0})$ denote the group with addition $$(a_1,a_2,a_3)\oplus (b_1,b_2,b_3)=(a_1+b_1+a_2b_3,a_2+b_2,a_3+b_3)$$ Let $G$ be the group defined by the relations $$x_2x_1=x_3x_1x_2\\x_1x_3=x_3x_1\\x_2x_3=x_3x_2$$ on $FG^{(3)}$. Note the first equation can be written as $x_2x_1=x_1x_2x_3$. I ought to show $G\simeq Z$. For starters, note that for any element of $\Bbb Z^3$ we can write $$(a,b,c)=ae_1\oplus ce_3\oplus be_2$$ so that $\{e_1,e_2,e_3\}$ genereate $Z$. Moreover, $e_1,e_2,e_3$ fulfill the relations with $x_1=e_3,x_2=e_2,x_3=e_1$. We thus consdier the natural (canonical) homomorphism $FG^{(3)}\to \Bbb Z^3$ by sending $x_1\to e_3$, $x_2\to e_2$ and $x_3\to e_1$. How can I show that the kernel of this homomoprhism is the normal subgroup generated by the elements obtained when equating the relations to the unity? It is clear that the normal subgroup is contained in this kernel, but how does one show it is actually the kernel? ADD This is all the author says about relations on free groups: ""A group $G$ is said to be finitely generated if it contains a finite group of generators $\{a_1;1\leq a_i\leq r\}$. Then we have the homomorphism $\eta$ of $FG^{(r)}$ sending $x_i\to a_i$. Since the $a_i$ generate $G$, this is an epimorphism and $G\simeq FG^{(r)}/K$ where $K$ is the kernel of $\eta$. The normal subgroup $K$ is called the set of relations connecting the generators $a_i$. If $S$ is a subset of a group, we can define the normal subgroup generated by $S$ to be the intersection of all normal subgroups of the group containing $S$. If $S$ is a subset of $FG^{(r)}$ we say that $G$ is defined by the relations $S$ if $G\simeq FG^{(r)}/K$ where $K$ is the normal subgroup generated by $S$. If $S$ is finite, then we say that $G$ is a finitely presented group."" The author gave an example on how to show two groups are isomorphic. It went something like this: Let $D_n$ be the dihedral group. We show that it is defined by the relations $$\tag 1 x^n,y^2,xyxy$$ on the free group generated by two elements. It is clear that $D_n$ is generated by the rotation $R$ by $2\pi /n$ and the reflection $S$ through the $x$-axis. Moreover $R^n=1$, $S^2=1$ and $SRS=R^{-1}$. Hence $D_n$ is homomorphic to $FG^{(2)}/K$ where $K$ is the normal subgroup generated by the elements in $(1)$. To show that it is isomorphic, we show that $FG^{(2)}/K$ has order less than $2n$. Let $\bar x=xK$ and $\bar y =yK$. Then $\bar x^n=1$, $\bar y^2=1$ and $\bar x\bar y\bar x\bar y=1$. Moreover, $ \bar y\bar x =\bar x^{-1} \bar y$ from the above implies that $\bar x^k =\bar x^{-k}\bar y$. Consider the set $\{\bar x^k,\bar x^k \bar y:1\leq k\leq n-1\}$. Then the product of any two elements is one of these elements, it contains $1$ and is closed under inverses. Hence it is a subgroup, but since it contains the generators $\bar x$ and $\bar y$, it is all of $FG^{(2)}/K$. Thus $|FG^{(2)}/K|\leq 2n$, which implies $D_n\simeq FG^{(2)}/K$. Questions $(1)$ I understand the reasoning by after ""Hence $D_n$ is homomorphic..."" but I don't know if I understand why this is so. Let $\eta$ be the natural homomorphism that sends $R\to x$, $S\to y$, and let $\zeta$ be $x\mapsto xK=\bar x$. We then use the homomorphism ""natural"" homomoprhism $R\mapsto \bar x$ and $S\mapsto \bar y$? $(2)$ Can a similar argument be used on the exercise I am given? I see that $\Bbb Z^3$ is not finite at all, so I don't see how this can be used.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
312174,What is the automorphism group of $\mathbb{R}$ under addition? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : What is $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{R},+)$? (1 answer) Closed 11 years ago . I do not know much about infinite groups. $\mathbb{R}$ is especially different from others I have worked before - it does not seem to have any generator like $\mathbb{Z}$ does or we could say that its every non-trivial element generates a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. I attempted to find the automorphism group of $\mathbb{R}$.
There are only three kinds of automorphism operations we can perform on $\mathbb{R}$: identity: $\psi_1: x \mapsto x$, $\psi_1 = \mathrm{id}$ reflection: $\psi_2:x \mapsto -x$, $\psi_2 \circ \psi_2 = \mathrm{id}$ translation: $\phi_r:x \mapsto x+r$, $r \in (-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$ Therefore the $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{R} * \mathbb{Z}_2$.

I suppose it is obvious that it is necessary that $|t^{k}_n| \to 0$ as $k\to \infty$  for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, but since $(t^{k}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \ell^\infty$ I think this is also sufficient because we have that $$

$$

A consequence of the existence of the Weil pairing is that, if the whole $n$-torsion is defined over $\mathbf Q$, then the $n$-th roots of unity $\mu_n \subseteq \mathbf Q$. This of course implies $n=2$. Thus, for an odd prime $p$, $E(\mathbf Q)[p]$ is cyclic, being a proper subgroup of $\mathbf Z/p \times \mathbf Z/p$.

$$I=2\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}}\arctan((x-\frac{1}{2})^2+\frac{3}{4})dx$$

Furthermore, I realize that when I am solving questions, I tend to get stuck on some intermediate step because that is where most of the algebra is needed.

312676,Showing Solution to Some Random PDE Tends to Zero Uniformly,"Another qual problem that is causing me some difficulty... Consider the PDE
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
u_{xxt}+u_{xx}-u^{3}=0&\text{in}\;[0,1]\times(0,\infty)\\
u(0,t)=u(1,t)&\text{on}\{x=0\}\times(0,\infty)\bigcup\{x=1\}\times(0,\infty)\\
u(x,0)=g(x).\end{array}\right.
$$
Take $g(x)=x(x-1)$ and show that solutions tend to zero uniformly in $t$ as $t\infty$. To solve the problem I used the usual energy argument, multiplying the PDE by $u$ and integrating both sides in space (applying to the periodic boundary conditions to eliminate boundary terms from the integration by parts) in order to easily obtain
$$\frac{de}{dt}(t):=\frac{d}{dt}\int\limits_{0}^{1}|u_{x}(x,t)|^{2}\;dx=-2e(t)-2\int\limits_{0}^{1}|u(x,t)|^{4}\;dx\leq0$$
so that the energy decreases.  Then, using the initial condition, I also have
$$0\leq e(t)\leq e(0)=\frac{1}{3}$$
for all $t>0$.  So I have a fairly sharp bound and the fact that $e(t)$ is decreasing in $t$.  If I could show further that $e(t)$ actually tends to $0$ uniformly, then that would imply $u_{x}(x,t)\to0\;\text{as}\;t\to\infty$ uniformly and that would give me $u(x,t)\to\;\text{C}\;\text{as}\;t\to\infty$.  Applying the periodic boundary conditions once more would then give me $C=0$ as required. However, I do not know how to show $e(t)\to0$ as $t\to\infty$.  I've tried computing additional derivatives of $e$ to see if I could glean any additional information on the decay of $e$, but the computations did not seem to lead to anything fruitful (even after playing around/substituting terms using the PDE).

$|f(t,x)-f(t,y)|=|(t^2|x|-t^2|y|)|=t^2||x|-|y||\leq t^2|x-y|$. This shows from the second definition that this function is locally lipschitz because as we vary t, our bound changes (the $t^2$ is the K from the definition). Is this correct? How would I go about showing that this is\is not uniformly lipschitz? 2) $\frac{y}{1+y^2+t^2}$ For this one, I tried to follow a similar method. $|\frac{x}{1+x^2+t^2}-\frac{y}{1+y^2+t^2}|=|\frac{t^2(x-y)-x^2y+x(y^2+1)-y}{(1+x^2+t^2)(1+y^2+t^2)}| \leq |t^2(x-y)-x^2y+x(y^2+1)-y|$.

313028,Iterated boundary in a metric space,"Prove that in any metric space $(X,\rho)$ for any $S\subset{X}$, we have $bd(bd(S)) = bd(bd(bd(S)))$, while not necessarily $bd(S)=bd(bd(S))$ Prof's Hint (first show that a boundary of a closed set has an empty interior) By Heine-Borel, I know a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact iff it is closed and bounded. Also a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called bounded if there is a real number $R$ such that $S$ is contained in the ball $B_R (0)$ So, $bd(S)$ must give us the information the $S$ is empty. Intuitively, boundary of the boundary equals to the boundary. (Its like there is no place we can go any further) But the question clear stated it is not necessary ???","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
313029,I need a textbook! Information theory and probability,"I have posted some questions: Probability result - 3 discrete random variables Markov chain - a notation I don't understand Random variables identities - how to make a formal proof. These questions reflect that I need to understand some concepts in probability theory. I would really like to hear if you, based on these questions, can help med find an appropriate textbook or a reference. I have already learned the basic probability theory (have taken a course), but the book I have to read (A First Course in Information Theory by Raymond W.

The expression gives me the remainder when $x=2$ or $x = 6$ By replacing $x$ with $2$ into the original polynomial you get: $$x^{100} - 4x^{100}+3x^{100}-3x^{10}+12x^{10}-9x^{10}+3x^{2}-29x + 41 = 3x^2-29x + 41$$ By plugging in $2$ I get: $12-58 + 41 = -5$. Hence $r(x)$ should be: $-5$. This is apparently the wrong answer. What did I do wrong? Thank you kindly for your help!","['solution-verification', 'algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"
313076,"Why does $\bigcup_{X \in \mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})}X = \mathbb{N}$, instead of $\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})?$","This is a practice problem I just came across,
$$\bigcup_{X \in \mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})}X =$$
I came up with $\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})$, but the book lists $\mathbb{N}$ as the solution. I would've thought the solution set would look something like this,
$$\{ \emptyset, \{1\},\{2\},\{309,12\},\{14,900,8,22\},\{6\},... \}$$
as opposed to this,
$$\{ 1,2,3,...812,...973,... \}$$
We're ""unionizing"" every possible element of $\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})$, each of which is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, not an element of $\mathbb{N}$. More generally, if for set $S$ you were to take the union of all it's elements, wouldn't your result be set $S$ itself?
$$\bigcup_{x \in S}x=S$$
Not sure where I'm going wrong here. Any help most welcome :) Update: I get it now. Thanks for you helpful explanations. My mistake was, as Brian put it, When you take a union of sets, you’re collecting the elements of those sets into one bit set; you’re not collecting the sets themselves. So my ""general"" example of taking the union of all the elements in a set is wrong because you can't take the union of elements, only the union of sets. I blame it all on the curly brackets :)",['elementary-set-theory']
313094,Axis aligned rectangle inscribed in rotated rectangle,"I start with an axis aligned rectangle, $R$, that I rotate by the angle $\theta$ to get $R'$. Afterwards I'd like to identify another axis aligned rectangle, $P$ with the following additional constraints: The center of $P$ should be at the center of $R'$ (and $R$) All points inside $P$ should also be inside $R'$ $P$ should be as big as possible, area wise What is the width and height of $P$, in terms of the width and height of $R$ and $\theta$? I'm not sure if these criteria uniquely identify a rectangle. If they do not, please enlighten me :) I've attempted applying my brain to the problem, but it appears I am enough out of practice that this is too hard.

313126,Independence of Brownian motion-related stopping times,"Let $(B_t,\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ a Brownian motion on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P})$. For $a \in \mathbb{R}$ define a stopping time $\tau_a$ by $$\tau_a := \tau(a) := \inf\{t \geq 0; B_t = a \} \qquad \qquad (\inf \emptyset := \infty)$$ For $w \in \Omega$ and $b>a$ such that $\tau_b(\omega) = \tau_a(\omega)=\infty$ we define $\tau_b(\omega)-\tau_a(\omega) := 0$ and $B_{\tau_a}(\omega)=B_{\tau_b}(\omega):=0$. One can show that the random variables $\tau(a_n)-\tau(a_{n-1}),\ldots,\tau(a_2)-\tau(a_1)$ are independent for $0<a_1 < \ldots < a_n$. The idea is to prove that $\tau(a_n)-\tau(a_{n-1})$ is $\mathcal{F}_{\geq \tau(a_{n-1})}$-measurable where $$\mathcal{F}_{\geq \tau(a_{n-1})} := \sigma(B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}; s \geq 0)$$ So here is the proof: $$\begin{align} [\tau(a_n)-\tau(a_{n-1})>t] &= [\tau(a_n)-\tau(a_{n-1})>t, \tau(a_{n-1}) < \infty] \\ &= \left[ \sup_{s \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq s \leq t} (B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}) < a_n - a_{n-1}, \tau(a_{n-1})< \infty \right]  \\ &= \left[0< \sup_{s \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq s \leq t} (B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}) < a_n - a_{n-1}\right] \tag{1} \end{align}$$ for all $t \geq 0$. I have some problems with the last equality. There is no doubt that ""$\subseteq$"" holds. But what about ""$\supseteq$""? For $\omega \in [\tau(a_{n-1})=\infty]$ I don't understand how the supremum $$\sup_{s \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq s \leq t} (B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})})$$ is defined. Is it by definition equal to zero? Edit: I already figured out this one. Since they define $B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}(\omega) := 0$ for $\omega \in [\tau(a_{n-1})=\infty]$ (i.e. ""$B_{\infty}=0$""), we also have $$B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}(\omega)=B_{\infty+s}(\omega)=B_{\infty}(\omega)=0 \qquad (0 \leq s \leq t)$$ for $\omega \in [\tau(a_{n-1})=\infty]$. And this means, that the supremum is equal to zero for all $\omega \in [\tau(a_{n-1})=\infty]$. For $t=0$: Since $\tau(a_n)>\tau(a_{n-1})$ almost surely, the left-hand is an event of probability one, whereas the right-hand side in $(1)$ is equal to the empty set since $$\sup_{s \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq s \leq 0} (B_{\tau(a_{n-1})+s}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})})=B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}-B_{\tau(a_{n-1})}=0$$ (Literature: ""Introduction to the Theory of Random Processes"" - N.
