391951,Solving two algebraic equations,I'm trying to prove an identity from physics.

391953,"Show that if some nontrivial linear combination of vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is $\vec{0}$, then $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are parallel.","I've never been that great at writing proofs, but I'm getting a bit better. I think I have the answer correct, but I don't know if I'm missing anything. My logic seems right but there may be some minute detail that I'm leaving out. Can anybody give any feedback on this? Thanks. $\vec{0}$ being a nontrivial linear combination of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ implies that there exists a non-zero $a$ or $b$ such that $a\vec{u}=-b\vec{v}$. Without loss of generality, assume $a\neq 0$. Then divide by $a$ and the equality holds: $\vec{u}=-\frac{b}{a}\vec{v}$. And since $-\frac{b}{a}\vec{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\vec{u}$, it remains that $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are parallel. More rigorous proof:
\begin{align*}
\vec{0}=a\vec{u}+b\vec{v}&\Longrightarrow a\neq 0\vee b\neq 0&&\text{Given}\\
&\Longrightarrow a\vec{u}=-b\vec{v}\\
&\Longrightarrow \vec{u}=-\frac{b}{a}\vec{v}&&\text{WLOG assume $a\neq 0$}\\
&\Longrightarrow \vec{u}\text{ and }\vec{v}\text{ are parallel.}

The question is this: How would I go about proving that, if R and S (R and S both being different Relations) are transitive, then R union S is transitive? The answer is actually FALSE, and then a counter example is given as a solution in the book. I understand how the counterexample works as explained in the book, but what I don't understand is, how exactly they arrive to the conclusion that the statement is actually false. Basically I can see myself giving a proof that if that for all values (x,y,z) in R and S, if (x,y) is in R and (y,z) is in R, (x, z) is in R since R is transitive. And if (x,y) is in S and (y,z) is in R, (x,z) is in S since S is transitive. Since (x,z) is in both R and S, the intersection is true. But why wouldn't the union of R and S be true as well? Is it because that the proof cannot be ended with ""since (x,z) is in both R and S, (x,z) can be in R or S""? Basically, that a proof can't be ended with an OR statement at the end?

392111,To prove that $2^{3n}+2^n +1$ is not a perfect square.,"Question: Prove that $2^{3n} + 2^n + 1$ cannot be a perfect square for any natural $n$. I attempted this question and failed in two different ways. 1) I considered a polynomial $p(x) = x^3+ x + 1 - m^2$ (for some natural $m$) and factorized the polynomial assuming $2^n$ is a root. I, then, tried substituting some numbers to get a contradiction in divisibility (since $x - 2^n$ is a factor). Alas, all of that was in vain. 2) I wrote $2^{3n} + 2^n + 1 = m^2$ and thus $(m-1)(m+1) = 2^n(2^{2n} + 1)$. So one can conclude that if $xy = 2^{2n} + 1$ such that $(x,y) = 1$, then one of the $m-1$ or $m+1$ must be $2^{n-1}x$ and the other must be $2y$ (this follows from the fact that $m$ is odd and $(m-1,m+1) = 2$). I am stuck at this point. I would appreciate a hint in either direction. I am hoping that 1) will work out. It will teach me a new proofing (err... proving) technique.

392249,How to understand C(X)'' = bounded Borel measurable functions?,"Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $C(X)=\{ f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \ | \ \ f \ continuous\}$ with the uniform norm. It is a separable Banach space. 1) I'm aware of the fact that $C(X)^*$, the space of continuous linear functionals $C(X)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ coincide with $M(X)$, the space of signed regular borel measures on $X$. This intuitively makes sense because $\mu\in M(X)$ can be naturally be seen as an evaluation map $f\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ by means of integration. 2) I'm also aware that $(C(X)^*)^*$, the dual of the dual, coincide with the set of bounded Borel measurable functions $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ (source: P. Lax, Functional Analysis ). UPDATE Landscape provided a counterexample in the comments.
My source was: P. Lax ""Functional Analysis"" 2002, Page 82, Theorem 14(ii).
I guess this might be a mistake, perhaps fixed in some errata somewhere. New question: C.f. Landscape's example, let $g_A$ be the extension (given by Hahn-Banach) of $f_A$ to $C([0,1])^{**}$. Looking at $g_A$ as a function $X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $g_A$ must satisfy by construction the equation $\int_{[0,1]}g_A \ d \ \delta_x= 1$ if $x\in A$ and $0$ otherwise. This seems to imply that $g_A$ is the characteristic function of $A$. Hence not Borel if $A$ is not Borel. Thus, $g_A$ as a function $(X\rightarrow\mathbb{R})$ is uniquely determined by the construction starting from $f_A$. But is it $g_A$ as an element of $C([0,1])^{**}$ uniquely determined? If so, it looks to me we would have a reasonably well defined notion of integration for non-measurable sets. Thanks!

392322,Relation of the kernels of one bounded operator and its extension,"Sorry for this long and formal post. The application in PDEs is mentioned just at the end. Let
 $$V \hookrightarrow H \text{  and } Q_H' \hookrightarrow Q',$$
 where $V$ and $Q$ are Banach and $H$ and $Q_H$ are Hilbert spaces. The hooked arrow $\hookrightarrow$ denotes the continuous embedding, which is basically $V \subset H$ and $\|v\|_V \geq \|v\|_H$ for all $v\in V$. The same with $Q_H'\hookrightarrow Q'$. Also, assume that the embeddings are dense, i.e. $\overline V = H$ and $\overline {Q_H'} = Q'$, where the overline denotes the closure of the space with respect to the norm of its superspace. Consider the linear bounded operator $$J\colon V \to Q_H'.$$ Then $V_0:=\ker(J)$ is a closed subspace of $V$. From an inf-sup condition, I have that 
$$\|Jv\|_{Q_H'} \geq \gamma \|v\|_V\quad (1)$$
 for all $v \in V_1$, where $V_1$ is complementary to $V_0$, i.e. $V=V_0 \oplus V_1$. Furthermore I have that $J\colon V\subset H\to Q'$ is bounded, so that one can define the natural extension $\bar J\colon H \to Q'$, using that $V$ is dense in $H$, that is bounded as well. Also for $\bar J$ I assume this boundedness from below, see $(1)$, for functions that are not in the kernel of $\bar J$. Now my question is: Is the kernel of $J$ dense in the kernel of $\bar J$? Or, equivalently, is $\overline V_0 = H_0$, where $H_0$ is the kernel of $\bar J$? What I have tried so far: I have shown that $\overline{V_0} \subset H_0$. To show the converse direction, I thought of taking $h \in H_0$ and show that there is a sequence $\{v_{0,n}\} \subset V_0$ that goes to $h_0$ (in the norm of $H$). Since $\overline V = H$, there is $\{v_n\} \subset V$ that goes to $h_0$ (in the norm of $H$). Because of $(1)$ there is a bounded projector $P_V\colon V \to V$, with $P(V)=V_0$. Then one can split up every $v_n$ into $v_{0,n}:=Pv_n$ and the remainder $v_{1,n}$ that is in $V_1$. Now I want to show, that $\{v_{1,n}\}$ goes to $0$ (in $H$) what would make $\{v_{0,n}\} \subset V_0$ approaching $h_0$. ...... In terms of PDEs, this would answer the questions, whether the (sub)space of divergence free elements of $H_0^1(\Omega)^3$ is dense in the (sub)space of these functions in $L^2(\Omega)^3$. In this case: $J:=div$ $V:= H_0^1(\Omega)^3$ and $H:=L^2(\Omega)^3$ $Q_H := L^2(\Omega)/\mathbb R$ and $Q' = (H^1(\Omega)/\mathbb R)'$ And the question becomes: Is 
$$ \{v\in H_0^1(\Omega)^3:\text{div } v = 0 \in L^2(\Omega)/\mathbb R \} \text{ dense in } \{v \in L^2(\Omega)^3:\text{div } v = 0 \in (H^1(\Omega)/\mathbb R)' \} $$","['functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

If we can construct this $G$ as the multiplicative group of a certain division ring, that is, $R^*\colon=\{r\in R\colon r\neq 1\}$. Then we know $G$ is abelian since finite division rings are commutative , and the abelian case follows from a direct use of the structure theorem of finite abelian groups .

if we're lucky we can read off the related Lagrangian $L$, introduce $p=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}$, do a Legendre transform and we got the Hamiltonian function $H(q,p)$ for which $\frac{\text d}{\text dt}H(q(t),p(t))=0$ for solutions of the differential equation. We can be more exact and give all the conditions for Noethers theorem to hold and the result is that along the flow $X(t)=\langle q(t),p(t)\rangle$ in phase space given by a solution with initial conditions $X(0)$, the function $H(q,p)$ always takes the same values. It defines surfaces in phase space indexed by initial conditions $X(0)$. I wonder how to view this for a priori first order systems
$$q'(t)=f(q(t)),\ \ q(0)=q_0,$$
where I think this must be even simpler. 
E.g. I thing some functional 
$$q(t)\mapsto q(t)-\text{an integral over}\  f(q(t))\  \text{something},$$
should exists which will be constant for solutions of the equation, i.e. only depend on $q_0$. For each $f$, the functional dependence of this ""energy"" on ""$q_0$"" will be different. However, I can't seem to find a general relation. What's the theory behind this, is there an energy'ish time integral of motion? What is the functional dependence on the intial condition, for a suitable constant of motion for for first order systems. And what would be the interpretation, given that we speak of a situation with only one initial condition? If it is that case that the system is too restricted so that there is no meaningful geometrical interpretation, then let's think about a system of first order differential equations. This is like the one we generated from phase space, except that it doesn't really come from a second order situation and so the intial conditions aren't really e.g. intial position and velocity.

I'm following a similar method we have been using in lectures for other Lie groups. I have already shown that $U(n)$ acts transitively on $Fl(n;m_1,m_2)$ and that $U(n)$ is connected. I'm wondering if what follows is proof that $Fl(n;m_1,m_2)$ is connected. $Fl(n;m_1,m_2)=U(n)/U(n)_{W_1 \subset W_2}$,since $U(n)$ acts transitively on $Fl(n;m_1,m_2)$.

Consider $U(n)_{W_1 \subset W_2}=\{F\in U(n) |F(W_1)=W_1, F(W_2)=W_2 \}$. It consists of maps with matrices of the form: A=$ \left( \begin{array}{ccc}

0 & B_{m_2-m_1,m_2-m_1} & 0 \\

Now I think that I have to show that the blocks in the matrix are themselves contained in a connected component of a Lie group, which would mean that I could connect each of them to the identity matrix of the respective size and thus connect any matrix in the stabiliser subgroup I'm considering to the identity, but I'm not quite sure how to proceed.

392621,Can I prove continuity of a function of two variables in this way?,"Common approach in handling functions of two variables is to express this function in polar coordinate system. For example, in the classic example $$f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{lr}\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} & (x,y)\neq (0,0)\\0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$$ say $x=r\cos(\phi)$ and $y=\sin(\phi)$, and then we can write $f(r, \phi)=\frac{r^2\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi)}{r^2(\cos^2(\phi) + \sin^2(\phi))}=\frac{1}{2}\sin(2\phi)$. Now if we let $r\rightarrow 0$, then it and, for example, $\phi=\frac{\pi}{4}$, the $$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}f(r, \frac{\pi}{4})=\frac{1}{2}\neq 0$$ so $f$ isn't continuous in $(0,0)$. Now I am given a function $$f(x,y)=(x+y)\exp(xy)$$Since this function is composition of continuous functions, it must be continuous, but I wanted to ask in common: earlier I used polar coordinates to tell that the function isn't continuous, so can I use the same approach to say that function is continuous, that is:
$$\lim_{r\rightarrow0}f(r,\phi)=\lim_{r\rightarrow0}r(\cos(\phi)+\sin(\phi))\exp(r^2\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi))=0$$

392691,Does the decimal representation of $\pi$ contain almost all numbers?,"Let $\Pi \in \Sigma^\infty$ be the decimal representation of $\pi$ where $\Sigma=\{0..9\}$. It is not known whether $\Pi$ contains each natural number. On the other hand, no number is known not to occur in $\Pi$. (Hope I've got that right) First of all: is this property unique to $\pi$ or do all irrational numbers share it?
UPDATE: As pointed out by Brian and MJD, irrationality is completely unrelated: 1. there are irrational numbers which are known not to contain all numbers in their representation (Brian) 2. there are irrational numbers whose representation contains all numbers (MJD). At any event, I think it should be much easier to show that almost all numbers are present, i.e. $ \exists N\in\mathbb{N}\forall k>N\exists p\in\Sigma^\star\exists s\in\Sigma^\infty: \Pi=pR(k)s$ where $R:\mathbb{N} \to \Sigma^\star$ maps each number to its decimal representation.

But the answer I get is twice as much as it should be, and I don't understand why. EDIT: With Marko Riedel's help, I corrected the error in my evaluation. Since 
$$ \left\{ \mathcal{M} \ \frac{x}{e^{2\pi x}-1} \right\}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{s}}{e^{2 \pi x}-1} \, dx = (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) $$ for $\operatorname{Re}(s) >1$, we have
$$  \frac{x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) x^{-s} \, ds , $$ where $c >1$. Replacing $x$ with $n$ and summing both sides, we get $$ \begin{align} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{e^{2\pi n}-1} &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1)\zeta(s)\, ds \\&= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} f(s) \, ds. \end{align} $$ The integrand has simple poles at $s=-1, 0$, and $1$. The fact that $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|$ decays exponentially fast to $0$ as $\text{Im} (s) \to \pm \infty$ allows us to shift the contour to the left. I originally shifted the contour all the way to negative infinity. But as Marko Riedel explains below , we want to shift the contour to the imaginary axis since the integrand is odd there. Indeed, using the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, we get $$ f(it) = \frac{it}{2 \pi} \sinh \left(\frac{\pi t }{2} \right) \operatorname{csch}(\pi t) \left|\zeta(1+it)\right|^{2}, \quad t \in \mathbb{R}.$$ Therefore, $$ \int_{c-i \infty}^{c+i \infty} f(s) \, ds = 2 \pi i \ \text{Res}[f,1] + \pi i \ \text{Res}[f,0] ,$$ where $$ \begin{align} \text{Res}[f,0] &= \lim_{s \to 0} s (2 \pi)^{-(s+1)} \Gamma(s+1) \zeta(s+1) \zeta(s) \\ &= \lim_{s\to 0} s\zeta(s+1) (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s) \\ &= 1\left(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \right)(1)\left(- \frac{1}{2} \right) \\ &=-\frac{1}{4 \pi} \end{align} $$ and $$ \begin{align} \text{Res}[f,1] &= \lim_{s \to 1} (s-1) (2 \pi)^{-(s+1)} \Gamma(s+1) \zeta(s+1) \zeta(s) \\ &= \lim_{s\to 1}(s-1)\zeta(s) (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) \\&= 1\left(\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2}}\right)(1)\left(\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}\right) \\ &=\frac{1}{24} . \end{align} $$ The result then follows.","['mellin-transform', 'sequences-and-series', 'complex-analysis']"

Let $D$ be a domain and $\overline{D}$ be it's closure. Suppose that $f:\overline{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic in $D$ and continuous on $\overline{D}$. If the boundary of $D$, denoted $\partial D$ is composed of piecewise $C^1$ curves then
    $$f(w) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial D}\frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz$$
    for all $w\in D$. This is stronger than the classical Cauchy integral theorem, because here we can allow the path we integrate over to be the boundary. This appears in Kodaira's book, but the book seems sloppily written and I found an egregious error in the first few pages, so I'd like another reference. This does not appear in Ahlfors or any other standard text I looked at. I am looking for any proof that extends to usual Cauchy's theorem to allow paths that lie on the boundary of a region, instead of requiring them to lie entirely in the open region like the usual version does. I managed to find a paper that sketches a high-powered proof when the boundary is a rectifiable Jordan arc (or some multiply connected region where each boundary component is) and gives a reference to a more elementary proof of the same result. I think a simpler proof should be possible in this case, where the boundary is assumed to be $C^1$. This is closely related to an old question that did not get much attention.","['reference-request', 'complex-analysis']"
392898,Is $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{I})$ isomorphic to $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{I}^2)$?,"Is $\def\Aut{\operatorname{Aut}}\Aut(\mathbb{I})$ isomorphic to $\Aut(\mathbb{I}^2)$ ? ($\mathbb{I},\mathbb{I}^2$ have their usual meaning as objects in $\mathsf{Top}$). I show some of one of my attempts. I was trying to show that the two are not isomorphic by considering the elements of order $2$ of both groups. If $\Aut(\mathbb{I})$ has a finite number of elements of order $2$, then $\Aut(\mathbb{I}^2)$ would have more elements of order $2$ (because for each $f\in \Aut(I)$ of order $2$, the functions $f_1,f_2$ given by $f_1(x,y)=(f(x),f(y)),f_2(x,y)=(x,f(y))$ are elements of order $2$ of $\Aut(\mathbb{I}^2)$ ). Shortly, I found that $\Aut(\mathbb{I})$ has infinitely many elements of order $2$, thus this does not work.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

392934,Do uniformly continuous functions map complete sets to complete sets?,"Let $f: (M, d) \rightarrow (N, \rho)$ be uniformly continuous.
Prove or disprove that if M is complete, then $f(M)$ is complete. If I am asking a previously posted question, please accept my apologies and tell me to bugger off.  I saw a similar problem but the solution was dealing with a Bi-Lipschitz function or some such business. I believe this statement to be true and here is a rough sketch of my reasoning: Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ maps Cauchy to Cauchy.
Let $(x_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $M$.  Since $M$ is complete, $x_n \rightarrow x \in M$.  Again, because of $f$'s uniform continuity, we now have $(f(x_n))$ is Cauchy in $N$ and $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) \in N$.  Thus $N$ is complete. By the way, I am studying for an exam.  This is certainly not homework.  I gladly accept your criticisms.  Thank you in advance for your help.","['cauchy-sequences', 'real-analysis']"
392952,"Proof of: If $x_0\in \mathbb R^n$ is a local minimum of $f$, then $\nabla f(x_0) = 0$.","Let $f \colon \mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R$ be a differentiable function.
If $x_0\in \mathbb R^n$ is a local minimum of $f$ , then $\nabla f(x_0) = 0$ . Where can I find a proof for this theorem? This is a theorem for max/min in calculus of several variables. Here is my attempt: Let $x_0$ = $[x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n]$ Let $g_i(x) = f(x_0+(x-x_i)e_i)$ where $e_i$ is the $i$ -th standard basis vector of dimension $n$ . Since $f$ has local min at $x_0$ , then $g_i$ has local minimum at $x_i$ .
So by Fermat's theorem, $g'(x_i)= 0$ which is equal to $f_{x_i}(x_0)$ .
Therefore $f_{x_i}(x_0) = 0$ which is what you wanted to show.
Is this right?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'maxima-minima']"
