672779,Equivalence between two definitions of successor ordinal,"So, here am I again struggling with Schimmerling. Now I just want to check if understood correctly how to relate the two definitions of a successor ordinal. We can define the successor of $\alpha$ either as $\alpha + 1$, or, alternatively, as $\alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$, right? Further, $\alpha + 1$ can be defined as $\text{type}(\langle \alpha, < \rangle\frown\langle 1, <\rangle)$, which is the order type of the well order defined over the concatenation of the ordinals $\alpha$ and $1$ (the concatenation itself is defined, in this case, as $(\{0\} \times \alpha) \cup (\{1\} \times 1)$, and the well order is defined as $(i, j) < (i,x)$ iff (i) $i=j=0$ and $x <_\alpha y$, or (ii) $i=0$ and $j=1$). So, basically, I need to prove that the order type of this concatenation just is $\alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$. I thought of setting an isomorphism like this: if $i=0$, then $\pi(i, \beta) = \beta$ for $\beta < \alpha$; if $i=1$, then we have the ordered pair $\langle 1, 0 \rangle$, such that $\pi(\langle 1, 0 \rangle) = \{\alpha\}$.

672791,Why does linear dependence require a *finite* linear combination to vanish?,"By definition, $S$ is linearly independent if for all $n>0,c_i\in F,s_i\in S$, we have that $c_1s_1 + \ldots + c_n s_n \neq 0$ whenever $\{c_i\}\neq \{0\}$. Why do we restrict our attention to finite linear combinations?
We could imagine a different definition: Set $S$ is ""infinitely linearly independent"" if for any indexing set $I$ and $c_i\in F,s_i\in S$, we have that $\sum_{i \in I} c_is_i \neq 0$ whenever $\{c_i\}\neq \{0\}$.

673144,Is the set of all functions $f:Z_+\rightarrow Z_+$ that are eventually constant countable.,"another question here to see if I'm on the right track. Here is the problem that I have been proposed. Determine if the set $H$ of all functions $f:Z_+\rightarrow Z_+$ that are eventually constant is countable. Here is my solution. I claim the set $H$ is countable. By definition, we say that $f$ is eventually constant if there is a positive integer $N$ such that $f(n)=c,\textrm{c a constant,}\ \forall\ n\ge N.$ Let $F$ be a set containing some $f:Z_+\rightarrow Z_+.$ Let $$H=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{Z_+}}F_n=\{f:Z_+ \rightarrow Z_+ |f\in F_n\ \textrm{for at least one}\ n\in Z_+\}.$$ Since $H$ is an arbitary union of sets, we can define a function $g:Z_+\rightarrow H$, where $g$ is an indexing function of $H$ and $Z_+$ is the index set given. Since $g$ is an indexing function, this implies that $g$ is surjective. By  Theorem 7.1, which states if $H$ is a nonempty set and there is a surjective function $f:Z_+ \rightarrow H$ then $H$ is countable, we have that $H$ is countable as claimed.",['elementary-set-theory']

673224,An Increasing Function Discontinuous at All Rational Numbers,"Let $q: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ be a bijective map and let $g: \mathbb{Q}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ define $g(q(n))=2^{-n}$. Show that 
$\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}}g(r)$ is absolutely convergent. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be define by the formula $f(x):=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x}g(r)$, show that. (1) $f$ is well-defined. (2) $f$ is strictly monotonic increasing. (3) $f$ is discontinuous at every rational number. (4) $f$ is continuous at any irrational number $x$ (hint: first demonstrate that the functions $f_n(x):=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x,\,g(r)\ge 2^{-n}}g(r)$ are continuous at $x$, and that $|f(x)-f_n(x)|\le 2^{-n}$). Sketch-proof First we have to show that $\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}}g(r)$ converges absolutely (I know that is obvious but I'd like to do a more elaborated argument of this fact). It suffice to show that for any finite subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ say $F$, the series $\sum _{r\in F}|g(r)|$ is bounded. Let $F\subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $\#F< \infty$. Then we have that the sequence $(q^{-1}(x))_{x\in F}$ is finite and therefore bounded by some $M\in \mathbb{N}$. Setting $\{q(m):m\in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } m\le M\}$ we know that it contains $F$. Thus \begin{align} \sum _{r\in F}|g(r)|\le \sum _{\{q(m):m\in \mathbb{N},\,  m\le M\}}|g(r)|
= \sum _{m=0}^M|g(\,q(m)\,)|\\
=\sum _{m=0}^M 2^{-m}
\le \sum _{m=0}^\infty 2^{-m}<\infty
\end{align} Now since $F$ was an arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{Q}$, for any finite subset the upper bound works in other words we have $$ \sup \bigg\{\sum _{x\in F}|f(x)|:F\subset X; \#F<\infty \bigg\}<\infty $$ which shows that the series converges absolutely as desired. (1) $f$ is well-defined. we have to show that $f(x)$ is defined for every $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Let $x\in \mathbb{R}$, then we have $$\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x}g(r)\le \sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}}g(r)$$ Since $g(r)$ is always non-negative for any rational number and since the latter is  convergent then the former must converges also. Hence $f(x)$ always exists. (2) $f$ is strictly monotonic increasing. Let $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x<y$. Then there exists some rational number in between, let call it $s$, i.e., $x<s<y$. Since $s$ is rational then there exists some $n\in \mathbb{N}$ for which $q(n)=s$. So $$f(y)=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<y}g(r)=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x}g(r) +\sum_{r\in X}g(r)$$ where $X = \{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<y \} \backslash \{ r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x\}$, clearly $s\in X$ so is a non-empty set, and since $g(r)$ is always positive for any rational. Then $$\sum_{r\in X}g(r)\ge g(s)=g(q(n))= 2^{-n}$$ Thus putting this together we can conclude that $f(y) > f(x)$, as desired. (3) $f$ is discontinuous to every rational number. Let $s$ be an arbitrary rational number, then there exists a $n\in \mathbb{N}$ so that $q(n)=s$. Now for what we have shown in (2), for any real number $x$ such that $x>s$, we have $f(x)\ge f(s)+2^{-n}$. We argue by contradiction, suppose that $f$ is continuous at $s$. Let $\varepsilon$ be a positive real such that $\varepsilon < 2^{-n}$. Since $f$ is continuous then there is some $\delta >0$ such that $|f(y)-f(s)|<\varepsilon$ whenever $y$ is a real number which is $\delta$- close to $s$, i.e., $|y-s|<\delta$. But there for any $x\in (s,s +\delta)$  we have $f(x)-f(s)\ge 2^{-n}>\varepsilon$. Contradiction. Hence $f$ cannot be continuous at any rational number as claimed. (4) $f$ is continuous at any irrational number $x$. Let $x$ be an irrational number and let define the functions $f_n: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by setting
 $$f_n(x):=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x,\,g(r)\ge 2^{-n}}g(r)$$ Let define $Q_n= \{r\in \mathbb{Q}: g(r)\ge 2^{-n}\}$. We claim that $Q_n$ is finite. If $r \in Q_n$ so $g(r)\ge 2^{-n}$ and since $r\in \mathbb{Q}$, there is some $m$ such that $q(m)=r$. Thus $g(r)=g(q(m))= 2^{-m}\ge 2^{-n}$, which means that $m\le n$, in other words $Q_n= \{q(i): 0\le i \le n \}$, which clearly contains a finite number of rational numbers. We shall show that  $f_n$ is continuous at $x$. Given $\varepsilon>0$ and $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We set $\delta = \min \{\, |r-x|: r\in Q_n  \,\}$, $\delta$ is well-defined since $Q_n$ is non-empty (at least contain $q(0)$) and all  $|r-x|$ are different to zero since $x$ is irrational, then $\delta>0$. Let $\{z\in \mathbb{R}: |z-x|<\delta \}$, we claim that $|f_n(z)-f_n(x)|< \varepsilon$. $$|f_n(z)-f_n(x)| = \Bigg|\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<z,\,r\in Q_n}g(r)\, -\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x,\,r\in Q_n}g(r) \Bigg|$$ If we can show that $\{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<z,\,r\in Q_n\}=\{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x,\,r\in Q_n\}$, then both series are the same and the difference is zero. $LHS\Rightarrow RHS$ By contradiction suppose that there is some element $r$ in $LHS$ that is not in the $RHS$. So $r$ is rational, $r<z$ and $r\in Q_n$. Since $r$ is not in the $RHS$ then we would have $r\ge x$. Clearly the equality is not possible since $x$ is irrational. In the case $r>x$, we have $x<r<z$. So, $z-x>r-x$, but $z-x< \delta \le r-x$ since $r\in Q_n$, contradiction. $RHS\Rightarrow LHS$ Again for contradiction suppose there is some $r$ in $RHS$ that is not in the $LHS$. So this is only possible if $r\ge z$. If $z=r$, we have $|z-x|<\delta \le |r-x|=|z-x|$, a contradiction. The case when $r>z$ is similar to the last case in $LHS\Rightarrow RHS$, just with the roles of $z$ and $x$ interchanged. Thus both sets are equal and then the series are the same. Hence its difference is zero  and $f_n$ is continuous at $x$ as claimed. Claim: $|f(x)-f_n(x)|\le 2^{-n}$. Since $f(x)=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x}g(r)$, then we have $$f(x)=\sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x, r\in Q_n}g(r)+\sum_{r\in X}g(r)$$ where $X=\{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x\}-\{r\in \mathbb{Q}:r<x, r\in Q_n\}$. Now since $X\subset \{r\in \mathbb{Q}: g(r)< 2^{-n}\} $, and $g(r)$ is non-negative for all the rational numbers then \begin{align}
\sum_{r\in X}g(r)\le \sum_{r\in \mathbb{Q}: g(r)< 2^{-n}}g(r) = \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty2^{-i}\\
=2^{-n}
\end{align} as desired. To conclude we have to show that $f$ is continuous at $x$. Since \begin{align}|f(y)-f(x)|\le |f(y)-f_n(y)|+|f_n(y)-f_n(x)|+|f_n(x)-f(x)| \\
\le 2^{-n} +|f_n(y)-f_n(x)|+2^{-n} \end{align} Given $\varepsilon>0$, we set $N$ such that $2^{-N}<\varepsilon$ and we choose $\delta = \min \{\, |r-x|: r\in Q_N  \,\}$. Then as we have proven, for all $y\in (x-\delta,x+\delta)$ we must have  $|f_N(y)-f_N(x)|\le \varepsilon$. So, \begin{align}|f(y)-f(x)|\le |f(y)-f_N(y)|+|f_N(y)-f_N(x)|+|f_N(x)-f(x)| \\
\le 2^{-N} +|f_N(y)-f_N(x)|+2^{-N} \\ 
\le 3\varepsilon  \end{align} which proves that $f$ is continuous at any irrational as desired. Hopefully this work :)","['self-learning', 'real-analysis']"

I managed to do this exercise in this exercise by reducing to the affine case and showing that $(\text{Spec }A,(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A})_{red})\cong (\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}, \mathcal{0}_{\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}})$ by actually defining an isomorphism on basic open sets. To me, this is the most straight forward way to do this exercise. However, there are quite a few things to check. I asked my lecturer about it and he suggested that instead of defining the isomorphisms on basic open sets, I could define the map by looking at the following diagram of sheaves on $\text{Spec }A$: $$
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 &  &   \\
\downarrow & & \\
\sqrt{0} &  & \\
\downarrow & \searrow & \\
\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A} &\rightarrow & \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A/\sqrt{0}} \\
\downarrow & \nearrow & \\
(\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A})_{red} & & \\
\downarrow & & \\
0 & & \\
\end{array}
$$ (sorry about the terrible diagram, I don't know of a better way to draw them on math.SE) Here the map $\mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec }A} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\text{Spec } A/\sqrt{0}}$ is the map coming from the ring map $A\rightarrow A/\sqrt{0}$. And $\sqrt{0}$ is the sheaf of ideals $U\mapsto \text{nilrad}({\mathcal{O}_X(U)})$. Now, my lecturer said that to show that the $\begin{array}{c}\nearrow \\ \end{array}$ map exists it is enough to show that the $\begin{array}{c}\searrow \\ \end{array}$ map is $0$ (then to show it is an isomorphism we can just look at the maps on stalks). My question is: why does the $\begin{array}{c}\searrow \\ \end{array}$ map being 0 imply that the $\begin{array}{c}\nearrow \\ \end{array}$ arrow exists. It looks identical to the case of the universal property of the quotient of abelian groups, rings (etc). Does anyone know where this is written down? I have looked in Hartshorne and Qing Liu's book but can't find anything about a universal property of quotients of sheaves. Thanks for any help.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

673518,Why are de Rham cohomology and Cech cohomology of the constant sheaf the same,"I am comfortable with de Rham cohomology, sheaves, sheaf cohomology and Cech cohomology. I am looking to prove the following theorem: If $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $m$, then we have the following isomorphism for each $k \leq m$
  $$
H^k_{\text{dR}}(M) \cong \check{H}^k(M; \mathbb R_M).
$$
  By $\mathbb R_M$ I meant the constant sheaf of $\mathbb R$ on $M$. I'll outline the proof I am following and give my two questions as they come up. If we let $\Omega^k$ denote the sheaf of germs of $k$ forms on $M$ then by the Poincaré lemma we have an exact sequence
$$ 
0 \rightarrow \mathbb R_M \rightarrow \Omega^0 \rightarrow \Omega^1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \Omega^m \rightarrow 0,
$$
with differential maps being the exterior derivative. Why is this sequence exact but the de Rham complex not? In particular, I think I may not be clear on how a ""sheaf of germs"" is different from a sheaf? And if I took global sections would I get back the usual de Rham complex? Anyway, assuming that the sequence is exact, we therefore get a series of short exact sequences (SES) of the form 
$$
0 \rightarrow d\Omega^{k-1} \rightarrow \Omega^k \rightarrow d\Omega^k \rightarrow 0.
$$
The sheaf $\Omega^k$ is fine, and hence its cohomology $H^i(\Omega^k)$ vanishes for $i>0$. Hence we get an isomorphism $H^i(d\Omega^{k-1}) \cong H^{i+1}(d\Omega^k)$ for each $i$. However, the last sentence of this proof is a mystery to me. ""At one end of the chain is the Čech cohomology and at the other lies the de Rham cohomology."" I can kind of see why after taking global sections we get back de Rham cohomology - i.e. the $H^0$ that come from the SES above is $H^k_{\text {dR}}(M)$. And the Cech cohomology coincides with the sheaf cohomology. But I am not sure how to relate them: should I be varying $k$ and get isomorphisms across the long exact sequences corresponding to different $k$?","['sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'homology-cohomology', 'differential-forms', 'manifolds']"

673526,How to change variables in a surface integral without parametrizing,"This is a doubt that I carry since my PDE classes. Some background (skippable): In the multivariable calculus course at my university we made all sorts of standard calculations involving surface and volume integrals in $R^3$ , jacobians and the generalizations of the fundamental theorem of calculus. In order to make those calculations we had to parametrize domains and calculate differentials. A couple of years later I took a PDE course. We worked with Evans' Partial differential equations book. This was my first experience with calculus in $\mathbb R^n$ and manipulations like $$\text{average}\int_{B(x,r)}f(y)\,dy= \text{average}\int_{B(0,1)}f(x+rz)\,dz.$$ This was an ordinary change of variables. $y=x+rz,\,\,dy=r^n\,dz$ and the mystery was solved. Like in that case, I was able to justify most of these formal manipulations after disentangling definitions. That aside, I found these quick formal calculations to be very powerful. However, I realized that I wasn't able to justify this: $$\text{average} \int_{\partial B(x,r)}f(y)dS(y)= \text{average}\int_{\partial B(0,1)}f(x+rz)\,dS(z).$$ I have some vague idea of what's happening: the same substitution as before, but this time the jacobian is $r^{n-1}$ because the transformation is actually happening between regions which ""lack one dimension"". Also, I see some kind of pattern: a piece of arc-length in the plane is $r\,d\theta$ , a piece of sphere-area is $r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \,d\theta$ , ""and so on"". Maybe some measure-theoretic argument can help me: I know, roughly speaking, that for any measure $\mu$ , $$\int_\Omega f\circ \phi \,d\mu=\int_{\phi(\Omega)} f \, d(\mu\circ\phi^{-1}).$$ I'd say $\phi(z)=(z-x)/r$ and $\phi^{-1}(y)=ry+x$ , but I actually don't know how $dS(y)$ looks like ""as a measure"" (It's not a product measure or a restriction of one, but it somehow relates to Lebesgue's in $\mathbb R^n$ ...). Why would I conclude that $dS(y)\circ \phi^{-1}=r^{n-1}dS(z)$ ? I have an intuition, but either I lack the mathematical concepts and definitions to express it or I'm just too confused. Is there some theory that I could learn in order to understand? Maybe something about the measure $dS$ . Is it expressible in terms of the Lebesgue measure in some way? Or set-theoretically, maybe, without having to resort to $n-1$ parameters and complicated relations? Maybe all of this would not have been a problem if I had ever mastered n-dimensional spherical coordinates. But even so, more generally, is there a way of changing variables when I'm integrating over a subregion of ""dimension $<n$ "" without necessarily parametrizing ? Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't really know what to ask for exactly. Note: I saw some of the answers to this post , but none of them were deep enough in the direction I intend. Note II: If there are no general methods or theories, maybe restricting to linear transformations, to Lebesgue measure exclusively, or to subregions defined by simple expressions like $g(x)=C$ or $g(|x|)=C$ could get me somewhere.

Define for every prime $p$: $$A_p:=\left\{ \frac{i}{p^j} : i,j\in\mathbb{Z}\right\} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$$
For any pair of distinct primes $p, q$ one can easily see that $A_p \cap A_q=\emptyset$, and both $A_p$ and $A_q$ are dense. This made me curious about general topologies, and I attempted to prove or disprove the following hypothesis: Given any topological space $(X,\mathcal{T})$, such that for all non-empty $S\in \mathcal{T}$ we have $|S| \ge2$, there exist two disjoint dense subsets of $X$. My Initial Attempt: Use the axiom of choice to define a function $f$ that selects an item from each non-empty open set in $X$. Now, use the axiom again of define a function $g'$ that selects an item from each set in:
$$
\mathcal{T}':=\left\{ S\setminus\left\{f(S)\right\}\,:\,S\in\mathcal{T}\setminus\{\emptyset\} \right\}
$$
and then define $g(S):=g'\left(S\setminus\left\{f(S)\right\}\right)$ for all non-empty $S\in \mathcal{T}$.
This means that both $f(\mathcal{T})$ and $g(\mathcal{T})$ are dense, and moreover $f(S) \neq g(S)$ for all non-empty $S\in \mathcal{T}$.

674029,Branch-point order and Cauchy representation,"This question is about the nature of branch points which arise in certain Cauchy-integral representations of functions of a single complex argument, $z$. Suppose we have the following representation:
\begin{align}
f(z) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f(x)}{x-z},
\end{align}
where we assume the integral exists for $z=0$.
This function has branch-point singularities at $z=0,\infty$ due to the fact that the (constant) endpoints of integration coincide with the pole of the integrand at those points. The question that I have regarding the order of the branch point is equivalent to understanding the behavior of $f(z)$ as a circuit is traced around the branch point $z=0$. Suppose I define the ""first sheet"" as the values $f^{(I)}$ of $f(z)$ where $z=x_0+i\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$ infinitesimal, as usual). I consider a circuit in the $z$-plane as $z=x_0e^{i\theta}$ ($0<\theta<2\pi$). The function is analytic at all points on this trajectory. Once, however, we consider $2\pi < \theta$ we must distort the contour to avoid the singularity in the integrand at $x=x_0$. This effects the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ onto what we'll call the ""second sheet"". The value $f^{(II)}$ of $f(x_0)$ on the second sheet is
\begin{align}
f^{(II)}(x_0) &= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f^{(I)}(x)}{x-(x_0-i\epsilon)},\\
&= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty dx \frac{\mbox{Im } f^{(I)}(x)}{x-x_0}-i\,\mbox{Im }f^{(I)}(x_0).
\end{align}
This demonstrates that $f(x_0+i\epsilon)-f(x_0-i\epsilon) = 2i\,\mbox{Im }f(x_0)$ and shows that the integration contour is the branch cut. We can continue the above procedure, I believe, an arbitrary number of times. So the order of the branch point at $z=0$ appears to be of the logarithmic variety (of infinite order). My question: Is the branch point that arises from an endpoint singularity always logarithmic?

674060,Existence and unicity of a complete bounded cell in a generic hyperplane arrangement.,"Let $n>d$ be integers and $H_1,\ldots,H_n$ be hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in generic position.
By generic position I mean that if we change slightly their position, then the configuration does not change, or equivalently $\dim H_{i_1}\cap\cdots\cap H_{i_k} =d-k$ when $k\leq d$ and the intersection is empty if $k>d$.
We call cells the connected components of $\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \bigcup_i H_i$.
We say that a cell is complete if it has $n$ facets.
I have two questions: Does it exist always a complete bounded cell? If there exist a bounded complete cell, is it unique? Edit: The answer to both question is no. I give the counter examples in the answer section. Edit 2: I let here the ideas I was following when I tried to prove uniqueness. It might be a useful point of view for related questions. For any subset $I=\{i_1,\ldots,i_{d+1}\}\subset[[1,n]]$, there is a unique simplexe $\Delta_I$ whose facets are contained in the hyperplanes $H_{i_1},\ldots,H_{i_{d+1}}$.
The collection of simplices $\Delta_I$ together with the inclusion form a poset $(\mathcal{P},\subset)$. We will note $\max\mathcal{P}$ the set of maximal elements of $\mathcal{P}$. I think one can prove that if $H_1,\ldots,H_n$ contains the $n$ facets of a polytope $P$ (a complete bounded cell), then $P=\bigcap_{\Delta\in\max\mathcal{P}} \Delta$.
If this is true then we have proved the unicity. I think I have a proof for $\bigcap_{\Delta\in\max\mathcal{P}}\Delta\subset P$. I am now searching for the reverse inclusion.","['geometry', 'polytopes', 'combinatorics']"

Question Let $A=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 | x^2 \leq y\}$ Find the interior of $A$, the closure of $A$, and the boundary of $A$.
Is $A$ an open set? Is it a closed set? My answers $A$ is not an open set. For example, $(1,1) \in A$ but if we look at a circle with $(1,1)$ in the center, and with radius $\epsilon$ as small as we wish, not all the elements in that circle will belong to $A$. For example, $(1+\epsilon,1) \notin A$. So $A$ is not an open set. ( QUESTION 1 can we automatically infer that if $A$ is not an open set, it is a closed set?) $A$ is a closed set, because $\bar A = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb R^2 | x^2 >y\}$ is an open set. for every $(a,b)\in \bar A$ we can find an $\epsilon$ such that all the elements in the circle originating from $(a,b)$ with a radius of $\epsilon$ are in $\bar A$. The boundary of $A$ is $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 | x^2=y\}$ The interior of $A$ is $A$/boundary of $A$ = $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2|x^2<y\}$ The closure of $A$ is $A$ ( QUESTION 2 if $A$ is a closed set, is $A$ = the closure of $A$?

Then show that for $i=1,2...,$ 
$$r_i^{-1} + 3r_{i+2}^{-1} = 3r_{i+1}^{-1} + r_{i+3}^{-1}$$ A picture is attached for clarity. Attempt: Under inversion, $C_s$ and $C_r$ are mapped to lines and $C_i, i \in \left\{1,...,6\right\}$ are mapped to circles. The map $f(z) = 1/z$ is conformal, so the angles are preserved wherever $f'(z) \neq 0$. Each circle has $4$ tangent points, (except $C_7$) so under the transformation these $\pi/2$ angles are preserved. The resulting image I have after the transformation is that the $C_i$ are mapped to circles that lie within the two lines and touch the sides.   The only way I see just now to preserve the angles is to have all the circles of the same radii. If $s$ is the radius of $C_s$ and $r$ the radius of $C_r$ then the centre between these two lines is $\frac{1}{2}\left(1/s - 1/2r\right) $. (But I do not think this makes sense.)

Assuming mere continuity for $f$ I can show right continuity of $\max_{t\in[a,x]}f(t)$: For $\epsilon$ and some $\delta>0$, 
$$x\in [x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta]\implies f(x_0)-\epsilon<f(x)<f(x_0)+\epsilon$$

674323,Building intuition of hypothesis testing,"I'm studying AS level mathematics (""college"") as a mature student and trying to wrap my head around binomial probability and hypothesis testing. I understand that $X\sim B(n,p)$ describes a binomial probability distribution where $n$ is the total number of trials and $p$ is the success probability. When using this to test hypothesis with a significance level, I am trying to correctly articulate what we're doing when we evaluate the binomial distribution. Let's say we're testing whether a coin is biased towards heads. We've tossed the coin 20 times and found head comes up 16 times. We then produce the following two hypothesis for the distribution $X\sim B(20,\frac{1}{2})$: $$
H_{0} : p=0.5
$$
$$
H_{1} : p>0.5, P(X\geq 16)
$$ Where $H_0$ is our null hypothesis where the coin is not biased, $H_1$ is the alternative hypothesis, the claim that the coin is biased towards heads. I then evaluate the binomial distribution: $P(X\geq16)=\frac{15}{10000}$. 
Which tells me that the ""probability of getting 16 or more heads"" is very unlikely . Comparing this to the significance level (e.g. 5%) helps me determine that there's enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis because were the coin unbiased/fair getting 16 or more heads is statistically unlikely to occur. So, my questions: Is my understanding correct according to my language above? When we evaluate the binomial probability ($P(X\geq 16)$ above) what are we actually asking? ""If less than our significance, the less likely something would happen according to the null hypothesis, thus the bias is more feasible"" or what?

So for the first part, I come up with $f(s,t)=(p_1+tu_1+sv_1,p_2+tu_2+sv_2,p_3+tu_3+sv_3)$ , is it correct?. But then I am confused on how to write the equation as $F(x,y,z)=0$","['geometry', 'parametric', 'calculus', 'surfaces']"
674535,Avoid dividing by zero with just variables and basic operators,"I am working on stats for a sports team, and one of the stats I have the ratio of Shots and Shots on Target (Which I call SOTP ). So, for instance, if a player has 2 shots, and one's on target, their SOTP ratio is 1/2 or 50%. Now I have a problem that I can't seem to solve. The software that generates the stats lets me put in numbers, variables, or basic operators ( +, -, /, * , and ** , which represents ^ ). So for the SOTP I have $SOTP = SHOTSONTARGET/SHOTS$. My problem arises when a player has zero shots since the denominator is zero. If this is the case, the software automatically returns nothing, which works until I need to use the SOTP ratio in another operation. For instance, I have something that generates points based off passes, goals, etc, but when SOTP is equal to nothing, the points return nothing, even if the player has points. So my question is, is there anything I can do to avoid the zero in the denominator by just using basic operators, constants, and variables? Thanks for your help.","['statistics', 'ratio', 'algorithms', 'linear-algebra', 'computer-science']"
674562,What's wrong with this 'open cover' of the Koch Snowflake?,"This question is to help me find peace. First, the question of the Snowflake's compactness has been tackled here on this site: Is the Koch Snowflake a Compact Space? Is Koch snowflake a continuous curve? But I'm inclined to believe it is not. The only reason Henning Makholm's argument does not fully convince me is because I believe I can come up with an open cover without finite subcover. What you do is surround each triangle with an open triangle small enough so that it doesn't intersect the 'sprouts' two levels down which sprouted out of the first iteration, and then repeat that ad infinitum. I hope this picture helps (the grey lines represents the open sets): So, my question is why does this open cover have a finite subcover?","['general-topology', 'compactness', 'fractals']"
674564,How many ways can you tile an NxM rectangle with L-polyominos?,"I came up with a problem that's been bugging me: How many ways can you tile an NxM rectangle with L-polyominos? The L shapes can be any size, so long as they aren't lines. For clarification: $L(1,m) = 0$, $L(2,2) = 0$, $L(2,3) = 2$, $L(2,4) = 2$, $L(3,3) = 0$... I've tried solving it using recursion (the only way I know how), by dividing the NxM grid into 2 smaller grids, but that doesn't account for many of the possibilities. Solving the problem algorithmically is pretty easy (I hope :P). Here are some of the values I get: $
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\[0.3em]
0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 6 \\[0.3em]
0 & 2 & 0 & 20 & 64 & 234 \\[0.3em]
0 & 2 & 20 & 110 & 752 & 4522 \\[0.3em]
0 & 2 & 64 & 752 & 7720 & 84846 \\[0.3em]
0 & 6 & 234 & 4522 & 84846 & 1557970
\end{bmatrix}$ I hope that makes sense: L(1,1) is in the top left, and L(6,6) is in the bottom right. Obviously its symmetrical diagonally.",['combinatorics']
