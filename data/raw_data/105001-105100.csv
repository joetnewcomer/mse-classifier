1480904,Given a 95% confidence interval why are we using 1.96 and not 1.64?,"I'm studying for my test and am reviewing the solution to some example problems. The problem is: You are told that a new standardized test is given to 100 randomly selected third grade students in New Jersey. The sample average score is $\overline Y$ on the test is 58 and the sample standard deviation is $s_y$ = 8. The first part of the question asks you to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean score of all New Jersey third graders. First I found $$\text{SE}_y = \frac{s_y}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.8.$$ Then I did $$58 \pm (0.8)(1.64).$$ However, instead of using $1.64$ they used $1.96$ .

1480963,Prove that $U=X+Y$ and $V=X/(X+Y)$ are independent [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : How to prove these two random variables are independent? (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago . Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables s.t. $X \sim {\Gamma}(r,1)$ and $Y \sim {\Gamma}(s,1)$. First, I took the Jacobian of $X=UV$ and $Y=U-UV$, which I found was $-U$.  To show that $U$ and $V$ are both independent, here's what I did: $$f_{U,V} (u,v)= \frac{(uv)^{r-1} e^{-uv}}{\Gamma(r)} \times (-u) \times\frac{(u-uv)^{s-1} e^{-(u-uv)}} {\Gamma(s)}$$ A hint I was given was to change this into a gamma function, in the form of $B(\alpha, \beta)=\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)/\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)$... but I'm not so sure this is right because I'm not seeing how this can be done above.

1480971,"Proof of Lipschitz continuity of coordinate map in $C[0,\infty)$","consider continuous function space $C[0,\infty)$ with metric
$$d(\omega_1,\omega_2)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}\left[(\sup_{t\in[0,n]}|\omega_1(t)-\omega_2(t)|)\wedge 1\right]$$ where $\omega_1,\omega_2\in C[0,\infty)$ I want to show that for any $t$, the coordinate map $\pi_t(\omega):=\omega(t)$ is Lipschitz continuous. I'm only able to show that $\pi_t$ is continuous without using $\epsilon-\delta$: if $d(\omega_n,\omega)\to 0$, then we can have they converge uniformly in each bounded interval. If not, there exist $n_0$ and $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ such that $\sup_{t\in[0,n_0]}|\omega_n(t)-\omega(t)|\ge \epsilon$,so  $(\sup_{t\in[0,n]}|\omega_n(t)-\omega(t)|)\wedge 1\ge \epsilon$ is true for any $n\ge n_0$.
thus we have 
$$d(\omega_n,\omega)\ge\sum_{n=n_0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}\left[(\sup_{t\in[0,n]}|\omega_n(t)-\omega(t)|)\wedge 1\right]\ge \sum_{n=n_0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}\epsilon\ge \frac{\epsilon}{2^{n_0-1}}$$ is a contradiction. then $\omega_n\to\omega$ uniformly in $[0,t]$, $\pi_t(\omega_n)\to\pi_t(\omega)$ in particular. but I can't prove the continuity above using $\epsilon-\delta$ which I think is more rigorous. (if $d(\omega_n,\omega)<\epsilon$, what can we say about $\sup_{t\in[0,N]}|\omega_n(t)-\omega(t)|$? ) moreover , it is actually lipschitz continuous, but I don't know how to get the lipschitz constant.

1480983,Interpretation of enhanced elliptic curves,"In  ""A first course in modular forms"" (Diamond-Shurman) the author defines something called an 'enhanced elliptic curve' for the congruence subgroups $\Gamma_0(N), \Gamma_1(N)$ and $\Gamma(N)$. For example an enhanced elliptic curve for $\Gamma_0(N)$ is an ordered pair $(E,C)$ where $E$ is a complex elliptic curve and $C$ is a cyclic subgroup of $E$ of order $N$. And later we prove the space of enhanced elliptic curves modulo the equivalence relation $(E_1,C_1) \sim (E_2, C_2)$ if $\exists$ an isomorphism of Elliptic curves $\phi: E_1 \rightarrow E_2$ such that $\phi(C_1)= C_2$ is in bijection with $\Gamma_0(N)\backslash\mathcal{H}$. Now, I have a few questions : a) If we accept that the set of elliptic curves upto isomorphism is in bijection with $G \backslash \mathcal{H}$, where $G$ is the full modular group; then in these particular cases what was the motivation behind considering a cyclic group of order $N$ (for $\Gamma_0(N)$, a point of order $N$ (for $\Gamma_1(N)$),etc., as the 'torsion data.' And a related but slightly general question, b)What is the intuition/technique behind deciding what extra torsion data should be added so that the bijection between elliptic curves with extra data (with an equivalence relation) and the modular curve works for a general congruence subgroup ?

There must must exist such a function $g\in L^{2}(0,1)$ because of the Uniform boundedness principle of Functional Analysis. This comes from assuming there is no such $g \in L^{2}[0,1]$, and considering the family of bounded linear functionals $\Phi_{x}(g)=\int_{0}^{x}fgdt$ on $L^{2}[0,1]$ which then satisfy $\sup_{x \in (0,1)}|\Phi_{x}(g)| < \infty$ for every fixed $g \in L^{2}[0,1]$. The conclusion is that $\|\Phi_{x}\|=\int_{0}^{x}|f|^{2}dt$ is bounded in $x$, contrary to assumption. However, in the case that $f$ is continous on $[0,1)$, it seems to me that there should be a way to construct a continuous $g$ on $[0,1)$, but I don't see it. Feel free to assume $f$ is continuously differentiable on $[0,1)$ if it helps. This is not a homework problem ...

1481106,Use a Double Integral to find the area between two circles,"I am having a difficult time solving this problem. I have tried this several different ways, and I get a different result, none of which is correct, every time. I've derived an answer geometrically and cannot replicate it with a double integral. Here's the problem: Use a double integral to find the area between two circles $$x^2+y^2=4$$ and $$(x−1)^2+y^2=4.$$ Here is how I have tried to go about this problem: First, I graphed it to get a good idea visually of what I was doing. Here's the graph I scribbled on. The region I'm interested is where these two circles overlap. This region can easily be divided into two separate areas. There are clearly a number of ways to go about solving this...but the one I opted for is to find the shaded region. The bounds for $x$ in this case are between $D$ and $C$. D can be found by setting $C_1=C_2$, and $x$ turns out to be $\frac{1}{2}$. On the right, $x$ is where $C_1(y)=0$, $x=\pm2$, so $x=2$ at point $C$. $y$ is greater than $B_y$ and less than $A_y$, which are also found where $C_1=C_2$, and $y$ turns out to be $\pm\sqrt{\frac{15}{4}}$. So far so good. Now I know my limits of integration. But here's what I don't understand. What am I actually integrating? $x$ has constant bounds, and $y$ does not, and looking at other double integral problems, that would lead me to believe that I should integrate $y$ first as a function of $x$, evaluate it at its bounds, and then integrate $x$ and evaluate it at its bounds giving me half the area I am looking for. However, when I try to do this, I get utter nonsense for an answer, or I get lost trying to set up the problem. I could really use the help, I've spent entirely too much time trying to puzzle through this. Thank you in advance! P.s.

1481294,Using nested intervals to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,"I am having trouble understanding this proof from the book ""Understanding Analysis"" by Stephen Abbot. The problematic part is on page 29 of the book, which is available on google books . Assuming that $\mathbb{R}$ is countable, it can be represented as a sequence of numbers: $\mathbb{R}_s = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, ... \}$ The idea of the proof is to use nested interval theorem to show that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ that is not an element of the sequence $\mathbb{R}_s$. This would mean that no such sequence of real number exists. The proof goes on to construct finite and nested intervals $I$ such that: (1) $x_{n} \notin I_n$ and (2) $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$. It is assumed that $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers. Since $x_{n} \ne I_n$, it is clear that for the first number we choose (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ This contradicts with the nested interval theorem that states the opposite: $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \ne \emptyset$ Therefore no such sequence $\mathbb{R}_s$ can be constructed, which means $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable. My questions Q1: If all the intervals are finite , how can we even use $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$? Example: Choose $x_3$ for $x_{n0}$ and $\{x_4, x_5, .... x_{n}\}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ for $I_1$ - following (1) and (2). How can I construct infinitely many nested intervals from a finite $I_1$ following (1) and (2)? There are maximally $n-1$ such nested sub-intervals, if $I_{n+1}$ is constructed from $I_n$ such that the first or the last element of $I_n$ is chosen as $x_{n+1}$. Q2: This part: (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real
  numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ (3) is perfectly clear, but how does that lead to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$? I mean, sure, (3) is valid for any $x_{n0} \in \mathbb{R}_s$, but that doesn't break the nested interval theorem. The nested interval theorem states basically that $I_n \ne \emptyset$. Is this the point? Rules (1) and (2) will enforce a constructuion of such $I_{n}$ that is an empty set, causing the intersection of all intervals to be empty?",['elementary-set-theory']

1481599,Most likely number of matching cards when two people select different numbers of cards from their own packs,"Two people R and T each have a standard deck of playing cards and each randomly chooses  as many cards as they like  from their packs. We know that each pack has N=52  different cards and that (say) R chose 10 cards and T 30 but we do not know what specific cards they chose. How do we now calculate the probability (p(M))  of  8 of the cards chosen by R and T being the same (e.g. both chose 6 of clubs, etc.)? or of 5 cards being the same? What we really want to know is the most likely number of chance matches in this scenario.  What is M with the greatest p(M)? Btw we are not interested in the order of picking cards here: R and T need not draw the same card at the same time in order of picking as each other for it to be a match. Hence I take it that this is a problem of combinations and since there is no replacement, hypergeometric? Indeed some of the required probabilities seem to be obtainable with the well known formula below, calculating combinations C where one can select different values of M to get p(M) for each value. This works  where R=T, i.e. both people pick the same number of cards, like in lottery analogies where the lottery chooses 6 numbers and people also pick 6 numbers (usually called K in these formulae):
(KCM x ((N-K)C(K-M))) / NCK But what I need is a formula that also works where K is not the same for the two people. If you like, in the lottery version, it is where the player would be able to choose more numbers than the lottery's six. Looking at formulae I have found involving extra bonus balls or people buying more than one ticket, they don't seem to quite fit my case. Picking 12 numbers and looking for matches with the 6 winning numbers is not the same as buying two lottery tickets of 6, each of which has to be separately judged for matches with the winning numbers in order to win? I have worked out answers on a very small scale, imagining packs of cards with only  4 cards in them, by constructing tables of all the possible combinations that could occur and counting matches. In the real situation I am interested in packs of 'cards' which could each have 1000 cards in them, however, so I  need a formula. E.g. for N=4, I get by hand that p(M=2) =.75  if R=T=3, and the same from the formula above. Where N=4, R=3, T=2 by hand I get p(M=2) = .5 but I can't find a formula to do this. but I am sure it is out there.","['combinations', 'probability']"

Let $z=\sinh q$, then $\sqrt{z^2+1}=\cosh q$. 
$$
\ln\left(\frac{z+\sqrt{z^2+1}}{z-\sqrt{z^2+1}}\right)=2q + 2n\pi+\pi i \quad n\in \mathcal{N}
$$ So we get:
$$
a=-\frac{\sinh q \pm i}{\cosh q}(q+n\pi i+ \frac{\pi}{2}i)
$$ Let $p=q+n\pi i+ \frac{\pi}{2}i$, then $z=\sinh q = (-1)^{n+1}i\cosh p$, and $\cosh q = (-1)^{n+1} i \sinh p$ Substitute to the expression of $a$:
$$
a=-\frac{\cosh p\pm 1}{\sinh p}p = -p\coth\frac{p}{2} \qquad\text{or} \qquad -p\tanh\frac{p}{2}
$$ Recall that $a$ is real, so $p$ must be purely real or purely imaginary(Is this claim true?), but $z=\pm i \cosh p$ is always purely imaginary.  So I've proved that the roots must be purely imaginary. If $p=ip_0$ is purely imaginary, $z=\pm i \cos p_0$. The form of the equation for $a$ reads:
$$ a = p_0 \cot \frac{p_0}{2} \quad\text{  or  }\quad p_0 \tan \frac{p_0}{2}$$ First we reckon $p$ to be real, and plot out the RHS of w.r.t $p$: When $p=-\pi$, we read out from the graph, $p=2.77168$ and $3.36624$. $z=\pm \cosh p$ give us the four desired root. But the problem is, when $a\in(-2,-\pi/2)$, there seems only one pair of roots from the graph. When $p=-\pi/6$, we read out from the graph, that $p=1.07018$, $z=\pm i\cosh p=\pm 1.62943 i$, which again give us the desired pair of roots. However, what if $a>0$, for example $a=\pi/6$, can't read out from this graph. Next we reckon $p=ip_0$: There are many crossings, read the ones most close to the $y$ axis(I don't have a particular reason). when $p=\pi/6$, $p_0 = 0.980755$ and $z=\pm i\cos p_0 = \pm 0.556395 i$. We get the desired results, but why should I choose the one nearest to the $y$ axis, there are many roots after all.  Besides, it seems that from this graph that $a>\pi/2$ we still have solutions, which is not right. I also want to mention that, the intersection of blue and orange lines  has the height of $\pi/2$. when $p=-\pi/6$ or $-\pi$, we can never get the right results, for $|\cos p_0| <=1$. Question is that what's the hidden flaws in this derivation? How can I fix them so that I can get the desired conclusion and results?","['multivalued-functions', 'roots', 'branch-cuts', 'complex-analysis']"

$X_n \rightsquigarrow X$. I think it is obvious that if for example $$\begin{align*}m P(X_n \leq 5/10) &= P(X_n = 1/10) + P(X_n = 2/10)  + P(X_n = 3/10) \\ &\quad + P(X_n = 4/10) + P(X_n = 5/10) \\ &= 5/10, \end{align*}$$ and $P(X\leq 5/10) = 5/10$ for $X$ uniformly distributed from $0$ to $1$.

1481937,Equal probabilities in each count in stars and bars,"Stars and bars is a common technique used in combinatorics. It asserts that the number of ways to put $n$ indistinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable bins is given by: $$ n + k - 1 \choose k - 1 $$ I've seen this count used frequently to calculate probabilities but after some thought, I am slightly skeptical as to whether or not each of the counts given by the stars and bars has a equal probability of occurring. Lets consider the case with 3 balls and 2 bins. I will represent different arrangements of balls with $(n_1, n_2)$ being the case where there are $n_1$ balls in bin 1 and $n_2$ balls in bin 2. Naturally, we have $0 \leq n_1, n_2 \leq 3$ and $n_1 + n_2 = 3$. We can compute the probability of $P(0,3)$, $P(1,2)$, $P(2,1)$, and $P(3,0)$ as follows. Label each of the balls so that there are $2^3 = 8$ different equally likely arrangements. Of these arrangements, there is only $1$ way to put $0$ balls in bin 1. There are $3$ ways to $1$ ball into bin 2, and the other two cases are symmetrical. 
Hence: $$P(0,3) = 1/8 \qquad P(1,2) = 3/8$$ This shows that the different items counted in stars and bars do not occur with equal probability. If someone would be so kinda, could you confirm this work?

1481950,Centre of the circle,"Another approach to the curvature of a unit-speed plane curve $\gamma$ at a point $\gamma (s_0)$ is to look for the ‘best approximating circle’ at this point. We can then define the curvature of $\gamma$ to be the reciprocal of the radius of this circle.
Carry out this programme by showing that the centre of the circle which passes through three nearby points $\gamma (s_0)$ and $\gamma (s_0 \pm \delta_s)$ on $\gamma$ approaches the point $$\epsilon (s_0) = \gamma (s_0) + \frac{1}{\kappa_s (s_0)}n_s(s_0)$$ as $\delta_s$ tends to zero. The circle $C$ with centre $\epsilon (s_0)$ passing through $\gamma (s_0)$ is called the osculating circle to $\gamma$ at the point $\gamma (s_0)$ , and $\epsilon (s_0)$ is called the centre of curvature of $\gamma$ at $\gamma (s_0)$ . The radius of $C$ is $\frac{1}{|\kappa_s (s_0)|} = \frac{1}{\kappa (s_0)}$ , where $\kappa$ is the curvature of $\gamma$ – this is called the radius of curvature of $\gamma$ at $\gamma (s_0)$ . I have done the following:  The three points $\gamma (s_0), \gamma (s_0 + \delta_s), \gamma (s_0 - \delta_s)$ are on the circle with radius $r$ and centre $\epsilon$ .  So $$r^2=\|\gamma (s_0)-\epsilon\|^2=\|\gamma (s_0 + \delta_s)-\epsilon\|^2=\|\gamma (s_0 - \delta_s)-\epsilon\|^2$$ Since we want show that the centre of the circle tends to $\epsilon (s_0)$ we do the following: \begin{align}
|\epsilon (s_0)-\epsilon|
&=|\gamma (s_0) + \frac{1}{\kappa_s (s_0)}n_s(s_0)-\epsilon| \\
&\leq | \gamma (s_0) -\epsilon|+\frac{1}{|\kappa_s (s_0)|}|n_s(s_0)| \\ &=r+\frac{1}{|\kappa_s (s_0)|}|n_s(s_0)|.

|\epsilon (s_0)-\epsilon|

Given a stochastic process $\{ X_t \}_{t \in [0,T]}$ on $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathbb{P})$, we can say by 'Fubini's theorem' that $$\mathbb{E} [\int_0^T X_t^2 dt] = \int_0^T \mathbb{E}[X_t^2] dt$$ or, if I'm not mistaken $$\int_{\Omega} \int_0^T X_t^2 dt d\mathbb{P} = \int_0^T \int_{\Omega} X_t^2 d\mathbb{P} dt$$ The left hand side of the first equation comes from here: Itô isometry , so all the assumptions apply.

1482474,Measures which are not real-valued,"I'm currently starting to study measure theory and the definitions I've seem up to now are: A measurable space is a pair $(X,M)$ being $X$ a non empty set and $M$ a $\sigma$ -algebra of subsets of $X$ which are called measurable sets. A measure on the measurable space $(X,M)$ is a function $\mu : M\to [0,+\infty]$ satisfying: $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ , If $\{E_n \in M : n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a countable collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets then $$\mu\left(\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{N}}E_n\right)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n).$$ This indeed make sense since the idea here is that $\mu$ is a generalized notion of the ""size"" of the measurable sets. The point is that I'm aware that there are measures which are not real valued like the one defined above. For example, I've already heard about complex measures. Another quite interesting example is the projector-valued measures which appear on the spectral theorem in Functional Analysis. Those projector-valued measures don't even take values on any set of numbers. They take value on a subset of the algebra of operators on a Hilbert space. Now, at first I find it quite intuitive the definition of measure given above, but I can't see how these other measures arise and how they are meaningful. So, how those measures which are not real-valued arise? How they relate to this definition? And I think more importantly, what is the intuition behind then? The measure defined above is meant to generalize the idea of size of a set, but those other measures what they intend to be? They can't be about sizes, since they can take values on sets which are not of numbers. So what is the point with them?","['definition', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1482645,Question about proof that group of order 48 must have a normal subgroup of order 8 or 16,"Prove a group of order $48$ must have a normal subgroup of order $8$ or $16$ . Solution: The number of Sylow $2$ -subgroups is $1$ or $3$ . In the first case, there is one Sylow $2-$ subgroup of order $16$ , so it is normal. In the second case, there are $3$ Sylow $2$ -subgroups of order $16$ . let $G$ act by conjugation on the Sylow $2$ -subgroups. This produces a homomorphism from $G$ into $S_3$ . The image cannot consist of just $2$ elements. Also, since no Sylow $2$ -subgroup is normal, the kernel cannot have $16$ elements. The only possibility is that the homomorphism maps $G$ onto $S_3$ , and so the kernel is a normal subgroup of order $48 / 6 = 8$ . My first question is the first sentence of the bolded part: "" The image cannot consist of just $2$ elements ."" Why can't it have $2$ elements? The homomorphism will map $24$ elements of $G$ to the identity permutation of $S_3$ , and the homomorphism will map $24$ elements of $G$ to the a $2-$ cycle permutation of $S_3$ . I don't see any contradiction here. If mapping $24$ elements of $G$ to a $2-$ cycle permutation of $S_3$ implies that there is a normal subgroup of order $8$ or $16$ , then I don't see why this implication is true. My second question is about: "" since no Sylow $2$ -subgroup is normal, the kernel cannot have $16$ elements. "" I don't understand this statement either. I don't see any relationship at all between a Sylow $2$ -subgroup not being normal and the kernel of the homomorphism.

This yields the equation for the line between their eyes (we can move to 2D cartesian): $z = -ar_0^{n-1}r+h$ Where $r_0$ is the location of his friend.

In the other hand by Gauss statement and Gronwall we compute $$\infty\leq e^\gamma+\limsup_{n\to \infty}\frac{\delta(n)}{n\log\log n}$$ Thus I believe that there no exists this $\limsup$. Too, I know that for positive quantities $\liminf\leq \limsup$, and $\sigma(n)>n$ implies by Gauss $\delta(n)\geq \frac{(n+1)(n-2)}{2}$. The purpose of following question is refresh notions on $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ and try compute the best unconditionally statements possible, you can use Robin and Erdös refined statements (see [1]) Question. Can you compute unconditionally or give bounds to $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ in these cases: a) same cited case for $\delta(n)/(n\log\log n)$ and b) same question but you scales previous quotient as $n^{\alpha}(\log\log  n)^\beta$, where $\alpha,\beta$ are the constants/functions that you desired/needs. c)(Optional question). If you can/want use Riemann hypothesis to give some statement about $\limsup,\liminf$ they are welcome. Using Robin's statement for Riemann hypothesis (see [1]) and Gauss, thus now I use the hypothesis here, it is easy to prove $$C:=\sum_{n=5041}^\infty\frac{1}{\delta(n)+e^\gamma n\log\log n}<2\sum_{n=5041}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$$ which is convergent since Leibnitz said that $\sum (\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1})$ is telescoping to first term of the sum. Question . a)Can you give the best unconditionally behaviour of previous series involving $\delta (n)$. b) (Optional question involving a computational experiment). Compute an approximation to constant $C$, with a computer. I don't know if previous exercises are in literature, yet. Thanks in advance, my goal is learn and y to encourage people, with these easy facts and computations. Of course my power is not solves, but yes learn.

1483105,Matlab code for finding the curvature of a curve using given data points,"I have data points $(x,y)$ for a plane curve, and I would like to find its curvature. While I was googling to check how could I start, I found this matlab code: mx = mean(x); my = mean(y)

  dx2 = mean(X.^2); dy2 = mean(Y.^2); % Get variances
  t = [X,Y]\(X.^2-dx2+Y.^2-dy2)/2; % Solve least mean squares problem
  a0 = t(1); b0 = t(2); % t is the 2 x 1 solution array [a0;b0]
  r = sqrt(dx2+dy2+a0^2+b0^2); % Calculate the radius
  a = a0 + mx; b = b0 + my; % Locate the circle's center
  curv = 1/r; % Get the curvature No specific explanation was added to this code except: ""The circle defined by center $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ will yield the least mean square value for the expression $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 - r^2$ among all
possible parameters, $a$, $b$, and $r$, over the points in vectors $x$ and $y$. The circle's curvature will be $1/r$."" The code worked very well, I checked this by taking as an example a circle. I also tried to follow what they did step by step to understand the concept used behind this code; however I was stuck on the use of the mean. I know least square is used to solve systems, but why use mean least square? Why is the mean and variance included? Would someone help me please. Any help will be highly appreciated.","['curvature', 'mean-square-error', 'geometry', 'circles', 'matlab']"
