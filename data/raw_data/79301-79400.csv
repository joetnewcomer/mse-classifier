1018801,Numbers which are not the sum of distinct squares,"We are defining square factorization as representation a positive natural number as sum of squares of different positive, integer numbers. For example $5 = 1^2 +2^2$ and $5$ has no more representation. But one number can possess more representations, eg. $30$. $$30 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 1^2 +2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2$$ Sometimes $n$ has no representation, eg. $8$. If square factorization for $n$ is impossible, we call $n$ indecomposable , so $8$ is indecomposable. Because it is a significant part of other proof I began to wonder, how can we know there is finite number of indecomposable numbers. Of course, it is well know fact , but I have still problem with proving that. How to show that any number greater than $128$ can be written as sum of distinct squares â€” for all $n > 128$ square factorization exist?","['sums-of-squares', 'number-theory']"

1018856,Determine if the following function is one-to-one and/or onto,"$T(x,y,z) = (xy,yz,xz)$
For one to one, I made $(x,y,z)=(u,v,w)$ and solved. $$xy=uv\to y=\frac{uv}{x}$$ $$\frac{uz}{x}=w$$ $$xz = uw \to x = u$$ $$uy = uv \to y = v$$ $$vz = vw \to z = w$$ So since every $(x,y,z)$ maps to a unique point $(u,v,w)$, $T(x,y,z)$ is one-to-one. Correct? However, I'm not sure how to prove that the function is onto.
I know that $T(D*) = D$, and  $T\vec x = A\vec x$ where A is a $3\times3$ matrix such that $\det(A) \neq 0$. But I don't know how to work with this to solve without having some points to work with. By looking at the function, I am pretty sure that it is onto because every point in D* will map to somewhere in D. But that's not sufficient. Could I chose arbitrary points and make equations out of it and solve those? For example: $$\begin{bmatrix}a & b & c\\d & e &f\\g &h&i\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}u\\v\\w\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ax+by+cz = u$$ $$dx+ey+fz = v$$ $$gx+hy+iz = w$$ Then choose arbitrary points for $x,y,z$ and note that from earlier $u=x,v=y,w=z$.
Then solve. But, T is already given, so this may be futile. Any help?","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'transformation']"
1018877,Finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to Sturm-Liouville operator,"I'm struggling to understand how to find the associated eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a differential operator in Sturm-Liouville form.

Its seems too easy to me, so I am worried something is wrong.  The class is very Naive Naive Set Theory so I realize some axioms are needed but that is way too hard for my students.  I guess I would just like to have this result and I used to just state it, but then I thought about this proof. We assume that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Suppose $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$,... is a sequence of countably infinite pairwise disjoint sets. Write $A_1=\{a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13},...\}$, $A_2=\{a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23},...\}$,...,$A_n=\{a_{n1}, a_{n2}, a_{n3},...\}$. Let $A=\bigcup_{i\in \mathbb{N}}A_i$.  Define $f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ by the rule $f(a_{ij})=(i,j)$. Since the $A_i$'s are disjoint $f$ is a function.  1-1 and onto are easily proved.  Thus, $A$ is countable. If we take off the pairwise dijoint condition then for every $A_i$ and $A_j$ with $A_i\bigcap A_j \neq \emptyset$, replace $A_j$ with $A_j-(A_i\bigcap A_j)$.

1019133,"Show that if $C(K)$ is separable, then $K$ is metrisable, for $K$ compact and Hausdorff","My question is simply as the title states: Let $(K,\tau)$ be a compact Hausdorff (topological) space. Show that if $C(K)$ is separable, then $K$ is metrisable. Firstly, I appreciate that this is a fairly well-known question, and I can find people quoting it, but I can't find (or determine myself!) a proof. All I have so far is that $C(K)$ is separable, so there exists a countable dense subset, $A$ say, of $C(K)$; so $\bar A = C(K)$. $A$ is countable, so I have enumerated $A$ as $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots \}$. So I desire a metric $d:X \times X \rightarrow \Bbb R$ such that $d$ induces the topology $\tau$ on $K$, but I can't see how to define $d$. The question is in the Stone-Weierstrass section of my course, and I know that the converse is proved with S-W, but I can't see how to prove this way. If someone would be able to give me a pointer , then I'd be most appreciative. If possible, I'd like a very minor hint that gives away as little as possible (I can always ask for a further hint). This is the first question I've done on metrising, so it may not be too difficult, just that I'm not used to it yet. (It seems like a good question so I don't want to waste the opportunity to learn from it!) Thanks in advance! :) PS: Should I instead be looking for a homeomorphism from $K$ to a metric space instead?

1019150,Self-adjoint operator restricted on a closed subspace,"Let $A$ be a  self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ (possibly unbounded, densely defined with domain $\mathcal{D}(H)$) and let $S$ be a closed subspace of $\mathcal{H}$, correspondingly let $P:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$ be the orthogonal projection onto $S$. Note that in general $A$ does not leave $S$ invariant. The operator $PAP$ on $\mathcal{H}$ is defined on the domain $\mathcal{D}(PHP)=(\mathcal{D}(H)\cap S)\oplus S^\perp$, dense in $\mathcal{H}$: it is zero on the sector $S^\perp$ and ``leaves'' the sector $S$ invariant in the sense that it obviously maps an element of $\mathcal{D}(H)\cap S$ into $S$. The restriction $\hat{A}$ of $PHP$ to $S$ is therefore the densely defined operator on the Hilbert space $S$ with domain $\mathcal{D}(S)=\mathcal{D}(H)\cap S$. Question 1: Is $\hat{A}$ self-adjoint (as an operator on $S$)? I cannot find a prove or a counter-example. Question 2: If $A$ is only assumed to be essentially self-adjoint on $\mathcal{H}$, can one say that $\hat{A}$ is essentially self-adjoint on $S$?","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"
1019160,How to construct explicit matrix representations of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$,"I'd like to implement an algorithm which produces matrix representations of the (complexified) Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ on carrier spaces with arbitrary highest weight vector; i.e. 8 $n\times n$ matrices $T_a$, $a=1,..,8$ with complex entries which satisfy $$[T_i,T_j]=i \sum_{k=1}^{8} c_{ijk}T_k $$ where $c_{ijk}$ are the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ structure constants. Let me first tell you what I have investigated so far: 1 - Tensor product It is known that ($n>m$) $$(n,0)\otimes (0,m) \simeq (n,m) \oplus (n-1,m-1) \oplus \ldots \oplus (n-m,0)$$ where $(n,m)$ refers to the carrier space of the irreducible representation with highest weight $(n,m)$ (as usual). The matrices acting on the left hand side are easily constructed via the Kroneckerproduct. The question is now, how can one extract the $(n,m)$ space from it. The only way I see is to get to know the above isomorphism explicitely (which would be the analog of knowing the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients in the $su(2)$ case) and this problem seems to be much more difficult to solve than my original one. 2 - Using $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-strings Assuming one knows the connection of all weight vectors to the su(2)-strings one could calculate its ladder operators (the describing equations would result in a linear system in the matrix coefficients) and from it one could reconstruct the 8 su(3) matrix-reps. The problem is finding these connections:
I first thought I could reconstruct the su(2) strings with the same algorithm one finds all weights from the Cartan Matrix. But I run into trouble if weight vectors with multiplicites $>1$ are appearing. Even if I'd know the multiplicities I couldn't find a rule for: which string belongs to which weight vector. 3 - Using the commutation relations I even tried to solve $$[T_i,T_j]=i \sum_{k=1}^{8} c_{ijk}T_k $$ directly. As Ansatz for the matrices I take general hermitian tracefree $n\times n$ matrices (which results in $n^2-1$ parameters). The first problem is that this is a quadratic equation in the matrix coefficients and Mathematica seems to be terrible slow in solving such a system exactly. Furthermore the $n^2-1$ parameters allow additional freedom (for example choosing some matrices to be real) and it seems not practical for automation since one would have to fix the remaining parameters for each case separatly.

1019388,Why are punctured neighborhoods in the definition of the limit of a function?,"The definition of the limit for a function $f:\Omega\rightarrow{}Y$, where the image $Y$ is a topological space and the domain $\Omega$ is a subset of some other topological space $X$, is that
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow{}x_0}f(x)=y_0$$
if for all neighborhoods $V$ of $y_0$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $f(U\cap\Omega-\{x_0\})\subseteq{}V$. Why do we exclude $x_0$ from $U\cap\Omega$? Are we trying to avoid something? I can see that if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $U\cap\Omega=\emptyset$ or $U=\{x_0\}$, then the limit as $x$ approaches $x_0$ of $f(x)$ could be any $y\in{}Y$. So under this definition the limit is trivial for points not in the closure of $\Omega$ or for isolated points. Why would we only want limit points to have non-trivial limits? Also, considering that $Y$ is not a Hausdorff space, wouldn't $f$ be automatically continuous for isolated points? It would be continuous for every non-limit point, except that non-limit points that are not isolated points are not in the domain, which is a necessary condition for continuity at a point. Does that also mean that if $\Omega$ has an isolated point $p$ then it can't be a Hausdorff space under the subspace topology inherited from $X$. Since every limit as $x$ approaches $p$ would have more than one value?","['general-topology', 'definition', 'limits']"

Robert Israel gave a nice proof that both solvable and unsolvable quintics are dense in $\Bbb Q^5$. A natural (non-topological) way to ask about the relative density of solvable quintics in all quintics is to ask about their natural density, as follows: Write our quintics as $x^5+a_0x^4 + \dots + a_4$, with $a_i \in \Bbb Z$. Write $$f(N) := \frac{\text{# of solvable quintics with } |a_i| < N}{(2N+1)^5}.$$ Robert Israel's answer to the linked question gives some data that supports our intuition that yes, the solvable quintics are in fact extremely rare.

1019518,Proving Lagrange method by using Implicit Function Theorem,"I am trying to show the proof of the Lagrange multiplier method. According to this in general, if $f$ and $g$ are $D+1$ dimensional functions such that $f,g : \mathbb{R}^{D+1} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, and if the point $p$ with $p=(x',y')$ where $x'$ is a $D$ dimensional vector and $y'$ is a scalar, is a constrained local extremum with subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=0$ and $\dfrac{\partial g(p)}{\partial y} \neq 0$, then at $p$ it is $\nabla f(p) = \lambda \nabla g(p)$. My approach using the implicit function theorem is the following:
From the above statement, for $g$, we can determine a ball around $x'$ for a $r > 0$ such that there is a function $h: B(x',r) \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ and it is $g(x,h(x))=0$ for each $x \in B(x',r)$. In this ball, we can state $f$ as $f(x,h(x))$ which always satisfies the constraint. Now, in $B(x',r)$ the unconstrained optimization of $f(x,h(x))$ will give us the constrained extremum point, $(x',y')$ and at $x'$ the gradient of $f(x,h(x))$ wrt $x$ vanishes. So it is at $p=(x',y')$ $$\sum_{i=1}^D \dfrac{\mathrm{d} F}{\mathrm{d} x_i}=\sum_{i=1}^D (\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial x_i} + \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial y}\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_i} )=0$$ We can differentiate $g(x,h(x))$ at $p=(x',y')$ wrt to $x$ as well. It should be trivially equal to zero. So, it is $$\sum_{i=1}^D \dfrac{\mathrm{d} g}{\mathrm{d} x_i}=\sum_{i=1}^D (\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_i} + \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial y}\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial x_i} )=0$$. I obtained all parts belonging to the gradients of two functions $f$ and $g$ but I am still not able to show $\nabla f(p) = \lambda \nabla g(p)$.

If it is not yet a correct proof, then I'll award an answer to the individual who can point out why and a hint as to what I must do to make it satisfactory. 7) Let $X$ and $A$ be subsets of a set $U$ and let $Y$ and $B$
be subsets of a set V. Prove the following: a) If $A\times B\ne\emptyset$, then $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y\Longleftrightarrow(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y).$ We must show that $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y\Longrightarrow(A\subseteq X)\wedge(B\subseteq Y)$
and that $(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)\Longrightarrow A\times B\subseteq X\times Y.$ Proof. ``$\Longrightarrow$'': This part of the proof is done by contradiction. Suppose $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$
and $\lnot[(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)]$. $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$
means that for all $a$ and for all $b$, if $(a,b)\in A\times B$
then $(a,b)\in X\times Y$. $\lnot[(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)]$
means that for some $a\in A,a\notin X$ or for some $b\in B,b\notin Y$.
From this last sentence we deduce that there exists some pair $(a,b)\in A\times B$
such that $(a,b)\notin X\times Y$. But that contradicts our premise:
$A\times B\subseteq X\times Y.$ Therefore, $\lnot[(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)]$
must be false and $(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)$ must be true.
Hence, we have shown that $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y\Longrightarrow(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y).$ ``$\Longleftarrow$'': This part of the proof is done by contradiction. Suppose $(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)$
and that the statement $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$ is false. $(A\times B\not\subseteq X\times Y)$
means there is some $(a,b)\in A\times B$ such that $(a,b)\notin X\times Y$.
From this we deduce that for some $a\in A,a\notin X$ and for some
$b\in B,b\notin Y$. But that contradicts our premise: $(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)$.
Therefore, $\lnot(A\times B\subseteq X\times Y)$ must be false and
$A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$ must be true. Hence, we have shown
that $(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)\Longrightarrow A\times B\subseteq X\times Y$.
Thus, the statement ``if $A\times B\ne\emptyset$, then $A\times B\subseteq X\times Y\Longleftrightarrow(A\subseteq X)\land(B\subseteq Y)$''

An ordinal is a set $A$ such that the elements of $A$ are well-ordered by $\in$ and such that $\forall x (x\in A\implies x\subset A)$.

Now, let $U =\exp(B_{\varepsilon /2})$, which is an open set in $GL(n; \mathbb{C})$. The last sentence is not obvious to me.

1020050,Martingale regularization with right continuous filtration,"The standard textbook presentation of the Doob Regularization Theorem for a martingale $(X_t, \mathcal{F}_t)$ assumes that the filtration satisfies the usual conditions.  It is clear that the assumption of right continuity of the filtration is critical (both in showing the adaptedness of the modification $X^+_t = \lim_{q \to t^+} X_t$ as well as showing the martingale property of $X^+$ using the Levy Downward Theorem).  On the other hand, it is clear that the assumption of completeness is stronger than necessary for all we really need to assume is that $\mathcal{F}_0$ contains the null event where the limits $\lim_{q \to t^+} X_q$ and $\lim_{q \to t^-}X_q$ fail to exist: this assumption being used to conclude that $X^+$ is $\mathcal{F}$-adapted. The question is that I occasionally run into scenarios in which the existence of a cadlag version is asserted with only an assumption of right continuity in the filtration.  This is not uncommon in Girsanov Theory in which the usual conditions cause subtle problems.  For example on pg. 325 of Revuz and Yor we have the statement ""These (classes of) random variables form a $(\mathcal{F}^0_t, P)$-martingale and since $(\mathcal{F}^0_t)$ is right continuous, we may choose $D_t$ within its $P$-equivalence class so that the resulting process $D$ is a $(\mathcal{F}^0_t)$-adapted martingale almost every path of which is cadlag..."".  There are other examples that I can quote (even Kallenberg is a bit slippery on this point). Without some a priori knowledge that right and left limits exist prior to modification I don't see how this can be true; we can certainly modify to a cadlag process within the $P$-equivalence class but without further assumptions on the filtration we destroy $\mathcal{F}$-adaptedness.

After about 5 minutes waiting, our professor gave us the solution (the class had ended and he didn't want to wait any longer): Give the bags numbers from 0 through 99, then take 0 coins from the bag number 0, 1 coin from the bag number 1, 2 coins from the bag number 2, and so on until we take 99 coins from the bag number 99. Gather all the coins we have taken together and put them on the scale.

1020580,What is the probability that you wil win this coin flip game?,"101 people flip a fair coin. Everyone who tosses heads is on one team and everyone who tosses tails is on another other team. The team with more people on it wins. What are the odds that, given you are one of the 101 players, you will win?
(101 players and coins eliminates ties but I am also interested the case where there are 100 players where you can win/lose/tie).",['probability']

1020598,Generating a data set that approximates another given random variable,"One of the question my friend was asked in technical interview : The probability density function for a normal random variable with Î¼ =

{xlow, xhigh} = {Î¼ - 4 Ïƒ, Î¼ + 4 Ïƒ};

  probability density function plotted above. Your job is to generate a data set whose cumulative distribution
  function can be expected to give a good approximation of the true
  cumulative distribution function of Y. My friend answered with below code but is incorrect. x = RandomReal[{-2, 2}, 50];
z = x - Mean[x];
stdNorm = 0.7/StandardDeviation[z];
StandardDeviation[stdNorm z];
new = stdNorm z + 0.6

1020607,Number of ways to select non-adjacent squares from a rectangular grid?,"I know that the number of selections of $k$ non-adjacent objects from $n$ objects (in a line) is ${n-k+1 \choose k}$, and for all possible values of $k$ including 0, it's $F_n$, the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number. However, when I tried expanding to the second dimension, the problem seems to become far more complicated, and I see no way of employing the 1-dimensional solution. How many ways are there to select any number of non-adjacent squares in a grid (including the empty selection)?",['combinatorics']

1020680,Constrained Optimizatoin: The Frank-Wolfe Method,A general convex optimization problem is framed as such: $$\min f(x) : x \in \Omega$$ where $\Omega$ is convex. The Frank-Wolfe method seeks a feasible descent direction $d_k$ (i.e. $x_k + d_k \in \Omega$) such that $\nabla(f_k)^Td_k < 0$ So I'm solving the subproblem: $$\min \nabla(f_k)^T(x-x_k) : x \in X$$ and in this instance am given the closed form solution: $$X = \left\{x:x \ge0 \sum x_i=b\right\}$$ where $b > 0$ The problem is to find (given an $x_k$) an explicit solution for $d_k$ to the subproblem. What I have done so far: Determined that $\sum d_i = 0$ since $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ must satisfy $\sum x_i=b$ Determined that $d_i \ge -x_i$ so that $x \ge0$ is satisfied at each iteration I know that if this were an unconstrained optimization problem the solution would be the steepest descent direction: $d_k = -\nabla f_k$ (I realize this is probably irrelevant) Any advice on how to solve this problem for the descent direction $d_k$ would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!,"['optimization', 'constraints', 'algorithms', 'linear-algebra', 'convex-optimization']"
1020695,Show a function is Lebesgue integrable,"Hi I am struggling with a question but really I am struggling more with the concepts behind it so any help would be appreciated. Q/ Let $$f(x)=\begin{cases} 
x^{-\frac{1}{2}} & ,x\in(0,1) \\ 
0 & , \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}$$ Let $r_k$ , k={1,2,3...} be an enumeration of all rationals and set $$
g(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}2^{-k}f(x-r_k)
$$ Prove g is lebesgue integrable. So if we say $\lambda$ is the lebesgue measure, the question is asking us to show that $\int g \;d\lambda$ is defined. It is clear g is not a simple function so I am thinking the first step is to show that g is a measurable function but then the question seems ambiguous, what sigma algebra do I use on $\mathbb{R}$ ? Is the standard to use the Borel sets? or maybe I should use the set of all Lebesgue measurable functions? Then since g is non negative the definition of the integral says $\int g \;d\lambda=sup\{\int f \;d\lambda\; :0\leq f\leq g\}$ where f is simple and measurable, so then I show this supremum exists and I am done?

1020705,Hodge star isomorphism,"In Petersen's Riemannian geometry text, he defines the Hodge operator $*: \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{n-k} (M)$ in the standard way. He then proves (Lemma 26, Chap 7) that $*^2: \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^k(M)$ is multiplication by $(-1)^{k(n-k)}.$ So far no problems. However, he seems to argue that this lemma implies that the Hodge star gives an isomorphism $H^k(M) \to H^{n-k}(M),$ where we are considering the de Rham cohomology groups. It is clear by the lemma that we have an isomorphism from $\Omega^k \to \Omega^{n-k}$ given by the Hodge star. But why must this descend to an isomorphism on cohomology? I guess one would need to show that the Hodge star maps closed forms to closed forms, and exact forms to exact forms? Is this clear from the lemma, or am I to conclude that Pedersen is foreshadowing a theorem to come?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'hodge-theory']"
